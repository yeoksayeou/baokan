<h3>各國代表多主張</h3>
<p>天空轟擊全廢除</p>
<p>英獨堅持規定例外</p>
<p>顧維鈞痛言日軍轟炸慘狀</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　英國於今日軍縮會議總委員會提出飛機用於警備之保留、各國代表羣起抗議、開會初、英代表艾登首先演說、言轟炸機在殖民地之警備用途、謂在多山而居稀少之區域、空軍在警備工作上優於陸軍、英國計劃中關於保留轟炸機供警備用途一節、决不可取銷云、荷蘭·南斯拉夫及瑞典代表對此見解、皆極力反對、但艾登聲稱、英國擬用飛機之處、係多山而少居民之區域、如以軍隊駐守、則甚危險、難免生命上重大損失、但用飛機、則一次警告即足恢復和平、英國决不能放棄此項提議、渠不妨對總委員會爽直說明此地位云、美代表威爾遜稱、美國主張完全廢除天空轟擊、此種廢除、必須絕對的無條件的且須普遍的、天空轟擊、非道德所可許、必須加以道德上之制裁、苟有例外、則將破壞道德上制裁之力量云、中代表顧維鈞博士提議爲人道利益計、删除英國保留、謂偉大帝或之造成、未嘗利用轟炸機、天空轟擊應完全廢除、苟有例外、則各國咸將維持轟炸機、旣有轟炸機、則難免不利用之、中國於此尤有惶慮理由、在過去二十個月内、外國轟炸機幾百架深入中國内地擲落猛烈炸彈以數千計、無辜男女老弱被炸死者數萬人、繁華都邑、非全被毁滅、亦受重大損害云、艾登答語、仍不變其主張、謂苟不許用轟炸機以供警備用途、則勢須留用許多兵士、而死傷數且將加多、如總委員會如接受英國數字、則各國空軍可減百分之五十云、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>禁止天空轟炸問題</h3>
<p>英美會外接洽</p>
<p>軍縮前途樂觀氣象</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　英美軍縮代表今日私人會商、企圖消除對於禁止天空轟炸問題之不同意見、兩國對於麥唐納軍縮計劃僅此一點有顯著之不同主張、英美雖供認天空戰事應當禁止、但英代表艾登認天空轟炸亦有確可減少死傷之時、故在世界某種僻野地方、有武力鎭攝之必要者、宜置禁例之外、例如代管區域内若干武裝優良之山地蠻族、往往憑恃山險、時常出擾孤村僻壤之居民、非用飛機進剿不易奏速效、若用尋常陸軍則耗費巨而喪失生命必多、美代表威爾遜則反對用轟炸飛機作警察用途、堅持必須完全禁止、謂美國認天空轟擊、無論在何種環境下、均屬犯罪行爲、力請英代表在軍縮提議内、撤回得用天空轟炸於警察用途之規定、雙方壁壘旣分、各國代表遂各有依歸、大抵有代管地而土人時常作亂者、咸贊成英國主張、其餘　多贊成美國主張、内以中國·德國及蘇俄贊成尤力、但料此項爭點當不難商得一折衷辦法、目下一般的印象咸以爲總委員會内對於軍縮公約、雖將來爭論尙多、總可商得美滿之同意、第當寬以時日耳、今日美代表威爾遜曾電美國務院、謂若軍縮公約不能早日簽定、渠信軍縮會議在經濟會議開幕以後、仍應繼續開會、美國務卿立即復稱、美政府以爲應繼續討論、俟得同意而後已、蓋會中已有在倫敦經濟會議期内繼續開會之建議、故美代表有此請訓之舉也、又今日法外長彭古聲稱、倘對於民用飛機有永久監督之美滿辦法後、則法國將放棄國際管理之要求、並對於軍用飛機接受量與質之裁减、其語亦足以增加軍縮前途之樂觀云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>日軍國之野心</h3>
<p>（紐約）　紐約泰晤士報、發表社論、評論遠東事變之進展曁日本擴充海軍之努力、略謂「日本之新野心可使美國對於軍縮問題改變態度」、其結論謂「日本欲稱霸於遠東、並欲使其海軍力量等於任何國家、於以見日本政治上之野心與海軍上之野心實互相關聯、由此情形可產生一種局勢、不許美國回復其孤立政策、而在一九三五年倫敦海軍條約重付討論之際、吾人必不願日美國陷於孤立」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>軍縮又臨難關</h3>
<p>今日討論安全問題</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　軍縮會議總委員會定明日處理安全問題　將遇全部計畫中最困難事件之一、即與互助公約有關之第六條是總委員會討論時之德意兩國態度、未予人以此項問題易於解决之希望、故衆料明日之討論、將發現歐洲各國意見之大相逕庭、此間某報載一傳說、謂世界經濟大會大倫敦開會半月後、或將移至日内瓦、因國聯秘書處難以同時應付兩處大會也、軍縮會議本定於六月十日閉幕、届時苟不有長期之休會、則經濟會議除移至日内瓦外、别無辦法云、美代表台維斯現主張軍縮會議休會不得逾兩星期、而國聯方面則贊成兩大會同時在日内瓦舉行、但亦有人主張軍縮會議休會至秋後者、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>「英國爲一侵略者」</h3>
<p>俄報批評英外交政策</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　此間「眞理報」今日著文評論英代表艾登在軍縮會議中所發表關於反對蘇聯提議侵略者定義之演說、據云英國本身爲一侵略者、其全部之外交政策即建立於侵略之原則上、故不願安全委員會所通過之蘇聯提議、對其外交軍事及諜報機關之行動自由有所限制、艾登反對蘇聯之提議、謂其過於「嚴格」、是可知彼好戰者流、乃不願其在他國境内之行動自由受有些微之約束也、英代表欲該定義具有「伸縮之形式」、而蘇聯提議之全部意旨、即爲去除此種伸縮性、以防止帝國主義者假「自衞及保護利益等藉口、進行掠奪之行爲、艾登必知彼列强尤以其中之一、最近曾利用彼所要求之「伸縮性」、以掩護共行爲、故彼之演說、賓代表頑固派及干涉主義者之意見、不啻宣布彼等之準備侵入他國境土也、該報之結論謂、顯然者、蘇聯代表國向彼侵略者所射之箭、已中其的、此固和平之幸、惟亦爲英帝國主義之不幸云、（二十七日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>李維諾夫赴日内瓦</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　蘇俄外委李維諾夫今日啓程來日内瓦參與軍縮會議、然後赴倫敦代表蘇俄出席世界經濟會議、其離國之際、由克里斯汀斯基爲代理外委、（廿八日路透</p>

<h3>美國對遠東問題</h3>
<p>有聽自行解决意響</p>
<p>羅斯福石井發共同公報</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　今日據可靠方面消息、美總統與日專使石井談論經濟與軍縮時、曾覺勢難完全避免談及遠東軍事形勢、但對於滿洲問題僅月簡短之討論而美總統亦未向石井切實說明美國態度、似頗有予以充分時問聽任自行解决之意響、並料美政府在最近之將來、不致有變更態度之聲明、以此間官塲又承認日本在日内瓦要求另商海軍新協定後、華盛頓方面不無若干緊張、但白宮談話、業已將其解弛一部份、並謂談話結果、雖未必能使兩國軍縮態度有實質之變更、但就石井之情形而論、業已消釋日本之欵忌不少、</p>
<p>美官塲現有一種感想、以爲日本對華政策苟無切實聲明、則世界經濟會議將受鉅大障碍、但亦有信將來開會後、當能有此種聲明者、按美總統與石井之談話、係與主要金融國代表最後一次討論、現日本對於减輕本國關稅之態度、尙無何種表示、但亦有謂他國來美代表對於此事亦未嘗有何特别聲明、大約將留待倫敦會議中發表也、石井現定星期日赴紐約、與該處銀行財政專家會晤後、即將遄赴倫敦云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>美日共同文告</h3>

<h3>美國何曾放棄中立</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　今日參院外交委員會通過授權總統、得宣佈禁止軍火輸出之議案、此案前在衆院業已通過、但外交委員會對於此案、另加以修正文一則、即宣佈軍火禁令時、必須同時對交戰國之雙方宣佈、以示美國中立（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　授權總統遇他國交戰或有戰爭重大威脅時、得宣告禁運軍火前往一案、經參院外交委員會審查後、今日已提出贊成報告、但附有强森之修正提議、須對於戰區四圍各國悉行禁運軍火、因歐戰時常有中立國購致軍火後、轉運與交戰國濟事、故對於中立國與交戰國嘗一併禁運、據强森聲稱、此項修正辦法可以保存美國傳統之中立政策、而將决定侵略者之權留於國會、因若對某國戰獨禁運軍火、不啻宣告該國爲侵略者、結果或將引起戰爭、按照憲法唯總統與國會有宣戰之權云、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<h3>時評</h3>
<p>華北停戰交涉眞相如何　梓</p>
<p>分析目前重要時事。俾讀者對之。得一較爲正確之理解。以遏止繁興之謠諑。此爲報紙評論主要使命之一。然事件之分析。有賴於適當之資料。此所謂適當者。包含不違眞相與來源可恃等條件。故國家有重要事件發生時。當局應給予新聞記者以採訪消息傳達新聞之便利。實爲必要</p>
<p>華北之停戰談判。經一度嚴重波折後。於二十三日晨間。雙方乃得接近一週以來。進行似頗順利。據外人電訊。第一步之工作。且已告一段落。惟在此時。因本國新聞界不能獲得採訪與發表之便利。無從以明瞭眞相禆益理解之消息。貢獻於社會。更無從根據以爲眞實事象之分析。致使對手方反得乘機施用新聞政策。傳布種種不正確之電訊。同時社會間亦因未能明悉談判進行之眞相。發生種種奇異之謠諑與推測。國人在此種情形之下。强昂者受剌激而憤慨。懦弱者因失望而意氣沉鬰。倘使此種情形。未能有以改變者。則其影響。殊爲可慮。當局旣以「一面抵抗一面交涉」之應付國難方針。宣告於國人。今已於抵抗之後。進行交涉矣。則更應以關於交涉之種種。公開勿隱。使國人得以了解。並求得其同情。而勿令久爲對手方之反宣傳與流行之謠諑所惑。而陷於憤慨沉鬰之境地也。</p>
<p>停戰之已由雙方諒解。中日軍隊之分别漸向後撤。此爲彰著之事實。在此彰著事實之下。究竟雙方諒解之要點何在。軍隊撤退之限度如何國人均欲一知之。日人之通訊社及報紙。自談判初次進行以來。盛播足以剌激中國人心理之謠諑。謂諒解之條件如何如何。華軍應退至何區何地。此種含有惡意之對手方宣傳新聞。吾人視爲殊少可信之價値。不欲更述之。准概由日人方面發布宣傳。影響所及已成流行社會之種種謠諑之根源。今欲切實證明日人所傳消息之違反眞相。與剷除流行之謠諑。其根本方術。惟有以採訪消息傳達新聞之便利。給予中國新聞界。勿稍隱秘。俾得　以揭露眞象並作適切之分析。</p>
<p>國家欲進行解决重大事件時。國人之同情與了解。實爲必要之條件。如不能具備此條件者。有利於國之事。不能獲得全國之助力。難於成就。負責當局有若何苦心。人不能知。更將不免於阻碍。此理諒今日辦理停戰交涉者亦必深知。而欲求得國人之同情與了解。則外交公開。實爲最適宜之方術也。</p>
<p>數年前。友人有留學德意志者。通信盛稱德當局於接受楊格計劃後。消解德國人民反對風潮之辦法之高妙。其辦法。却藉新聞紙以交涉經過之眞相與當局爲難之苦心。傳達於德國人民而卒因是以求得人民之同情與了解。反對風潮。未幾即已。吾人願今日辦理停戰交涉者。一施用此德當局行之有效之方法。</p>

<h3>高橋决定留任後</h3>
<p>日本政局仍不安定</p>
<p>政友會竭力與齋籐爲難</p>
<p>日聯二十八日東京電　高橋藏相决定留任後、政界雖一時安定、然政友會對於政府態度非常憤慨、其結果政局又復陷於不安狀態矣、即政友會内部現分兩派、一主張即時與現内閣絕綠、一以爲時期尚早、暫以自重態度靜觀形勢、然主張絕緣派之勢力漸大、因此鈴木總裁亦未敢輕易下斷定、其維持現内閣者、利用政友會强硬態度者、企圖實現鈴木内閣、平沼内閣、宇垣内閣等者、分别進行活動、然政府方面、因高橋之决意盡其任務、雖遇政友會之絕緣、以爲改造内閣不甚困難、尚抱樂觀、故政局暫時可維持現狀、然至編成豫算之時、政府及政友會之間、必呈相當緊張形勢、</p>
<p>日聯二十八日東京電　日政界現雖安定、然其前途暗雲低迷、不許樂觀、據各派之觀察、政局將來趨向如下、（一）貴族院、鈐木總裁與政府成與高橋藏相之感情惡化、自高橋留任藏相以來、更　爲甚烈、然政友會内部分裂、故絕緣問題不能輕易實行、齋籐首相及鈴木總裁應早决定態度、努力一掃暗雲爲要、（二）民政黨、政友會現在無能透察政局之大政治家、故至編成豫算之時期爲止、不能决定確然態度、如政友會届時實行絕緣、則民政黨依照旣定方針擁護現内閣、排繫政友會陰謀、盡力使齋籐容易改造内閣、故無論政友會取何種態度、政局不致有大變化、（三）國民同盟、本黨爲唯一野黨、始終確信豫算編成時期發生政變、故黨内一致團結準備繼任内閣、</p>
<p>電通二十八日東京電　政友會議員中之少壯急進派、明日下午一時開議員會、表明實行與現内閣立即絕緣之强硬態度、并促鈴木總裁之决斷云、</p>
<p>電通二十八日東京電　鈴木政友總裁注視黨内急進自重兩派之趨勢、令島田松野山崎等首腦部歷訪黨之長老、搜集情報然黨之大勢、即時絕緣論、漸次有力、苟有大義名分、即自重論者、亦無强行反對即時絕緣之意、鈐木總裁察知此狀内心似已决定、故政友對政府之絕緣期、或將提早、於豫算編成期前、即六月下旬斷行亦未可知、</p>
<p>電通二十八日東京電　國民同盟於今日下午三時開全體大會、安達總裁以下山道幹事長中野淸瀨古屋等協商時局對策、當時安達總裁之演說如下、高橋藏相之允諾留任、齋籐内閣乃得保持、政局因之安定等之推測、係屬於法相、政局當然更不安定、旣成政黨將趨崩潰、若謂非常時局現已解消、得返憲政常道、或謂非常時局尚未解消、故維持現内閣、實則皆誤、緣政黨之信用、尚未若何恢復、且同時有主張、現係非常時、應更迭内閣云云、然若係非常時、應打倒無能無爲之内閣、應改革政黨後向建立非常時對策邁進也云、</p>

<p>國民二十七日柏林電　德政府新订規章、凡德國人民之欲過境赴粤者、須付出境護照費一千馬克、以現在匯兌率計之、約在七十金鎊之譜、此項嚴酷之法命、實不啻欲將德奥間之交通斷絕、使德人除邊境商民得繼續往返於兩國間者外、其餘一切遊歷人等、概行緊絕、此舉最大之原因、實爲德奥兩國政府間惡感日深、而與當局對於國家社會黨人物尤表示敵視之意、致有禁止其人衣着國社黨制服佩帶國社黨徽章之法令頒佈、德當局有鑒于此、復以德人過境入奥者是否爲國社黨份之、又一時難以區别、故爲便利管理起見、並爲避免德人與奥政府當局發生不幸事件起見、遂决定採取重稅制度、以示寓禁于徵之意云、</p>

<h3>德國危機濳伏尚深（柏林通信）</h3>
<p>失業者未見减少企業家債務加重</p>
<p>政府負債纍纍軍縮問題最難解决</p>
<p>希特拉執政以來、差不多快要四個月了、牠的政蹟如何、是要等到他的時間四年之後才可以看見、現在我們是還看不出來、不過他上台之初、曾標榜三大綱目、第一是改造陷於混亂的勞動組織、特别是壓迫共產黨、第二是恢復勞資兩階級的調和運動、第三是增進一切產業部門内在的實力、這　是德意志聯邦經濟會議所通過了要徹底實行的經濟政策、</p>
<p>現在共產黨的活動在表面上算是停止了、而且馬克司·列寗·甚至考茲基的書都不能公開的發賣了、勞工的組織差不多都變了地下運動、即社會民主黨所領導的工會也大受摧殘、同樣被認爲與德國「國民精神」相違背、然而農村方面的窮乏狀况、實際上也許會比我們的祖國丨中華民國丨好些、但是從不曾看見、也不曾聽見有什麽緊急的救濟方策、所以農業產品的價格、與工業產品的價格相差得很遠、例如今年三月的物價指數、農產物的批發價格、（假定一九一三年爲一○○）則本年三月爲八一·六而精製工業產品别維持一一一·五的高位、牧畜業的頽敗、較之農業還更厲害、因此希特拉政府正在講究如何提高奶油和牛奶價格的方法、原因是救濟農村振興農村即是直接替工業生產品找出路、開拓國内的市場、德國工業製品消售給農民的不過五分之一、所以農村恢復與工業是有絕大的影響、可是德國政府的實行力究竟如何、還是問題、並且與農民處於同等地位、遭受悲慘境遇的是失業工人羣衆、如果要講到恢復市面景氣、則對於六百餘萬的失業羣衆、絕對不能聽其自然、而袖手旁觀、所以德國歷來的政府對此都非常注意、且竭其全力投下巨額的資金、以救濟失業者、最近希特拉對於公共土木事業、由國庫提出一億二千五百萬馬克來援助失業者找工作、其效力也與美國二十五萬失業工人組織一服務軍」差不多、範圍是窄小、被救濟的人和失業總數比較究竟有限、他要想收羅滿街滿巷的失業工人羣衆、同時又拿爲社會謀福利來激厲羣衆、來提高政府的經濟政策的實行力和信用、想收獲經濟理論上以最小的勞力、收最大的效果、</p>
<p>希特拉的實權、比之美國議會所付與美總統的獨裁權力還大得多、德意志聯邦内國家機構的全部都任希特拉隨意指揮、並且他底下還有一位宣傅總長、常常以命令爲政府及其政策宣傅、喚起輿論、專心努力於政府所指定的事業、</p>
<p>但是德國的經濟界從本年二月以來、景氣有了上昇的象徵、市面漸現轉機、可是新的力量到底能到達什麽程度、現在還不能預測、所以景氣的恢復、第一階段能夠到達什麽樣子、經濟界自動的恢復力和調節力、究竟有多少大、誰也不敢貿然斷定、而且面前危險的潛伏還很多、</p>
<p>第一是一般大衆的購買力依然非常低微、一時不易復原、更說不到超過從前的水平了、</p>
<p>第二是失業羣衆的减少、僅只是季節關係、比較去年同時期不見得好些、則今年夏季以後不免會比去年、更見惡劣、</p>
<p>第三是企業家對債務的負担、一天比一天加重、借新債還舊債决不是打開出路的方法、而對外貿易並未轉佳、德國又是一個輸出超過國　即使世界經濟會議議出相當的適當方法、對德國也未必就恰符需要、則德國企業界未必有振興之望、第四是賠欵雖然是停頓、竟可說是無形中止、而德國對外負債總額計有二百二十八億馬克即將政治債務除開、也還有二百十三億馬克、拿牠的對手而論、英國對外負債不過百億馬克、法國不過一百二十億馬克、這樣巨大的債務、又將何以償還呢、</p>
<p>最後一個是世界問題　同時也是德國與法國之間最難解决、困難最多、危險性最大的軍備縮小問題、在德國國民特别是國家社會黨員和準國家社會黨員、認爲高度軍備國家（如法蘭西）不肯縮小軍備、所以漠視德國軍備平等的要求、而德國堅持「軍備平等」、否則即自動的否定凡爾賽和約、量力增加軍備、但在法國或英國方面看、德國的十萬國防軍、其就役期間長到七年、其訓練的科目都是將校的科目　而德國軍隊武器方面的材料又非常優良、同時國社黨還有突繫隊、國權黨有鐵盔團、牠們都充分的實施過軍事訓練、縱然算不得正式能作戰的軍隊、却能喚起其一般國民狹義的愛國精神、因此引起歐洲政治上的危機、其實德國本身縱使「軍備平等」實現之後、也不過加重人民的負担、眞正的福利、誰都曉得是十分靠不住、並且有招致大禍之虞、不過現　的德國境内絕對没有說話的自由、所以没人敢於說起、更没有人反對軍備平等、祗好任隨危機增大、（一九三三·四·三十日於柏林）</p>

<p>停戰辦法業已商妥</p>

<p>行政院駐平政務整理委員會、内部組織、大致商妥、秘書處範圍較廣、現已着手組織、政務財務、因王　翰在津、王克敏病目、未能趕速籌備、刻因汪精衛電催從速成立、黄乃電邀不在北平各委、即日到平談商、以便於最短期間、正式成立、昨夜張志潭由津來平、王樹翰亦於今晨趕到、張王二氏、今日上午均至豐澤園晤黄、協商一切、原有之政務委員會及財政委員會、完全結束、所有事務移歸政整會政務財務兩處辦理、王樹翰王克敏、原爲政會及財會之常委、一切事務、向多經手、駕輕就熟、自能勝任愉快、會址確定在舊外交部財政整理委員會内、現已定於六月一日正式成立、</p>
<p>另一特信、中日和平運動、自雙方進行以來、經過圓滿、外傳成立停戰協定及磋商至相當程度云云、官方仍肯無定之表示、則是否可靠、無從證明、惟自二十三日以後、前線軍事、確已緩和、當二十二日夜間、通州一度吃緊彼時日軍坦克車渡河西犯、迫近城郊、通州城内、陷於混亂、初經我軍騎兵、竭力抗戰、民衆急於逃難、遺失財物甚多、婦女尤驚惶萬分、秩序已失常態、幸經龐炳勛部趕到、始將日軍擊退、嗣後和平空氣、空轉濃厚、平津危險時期、漸成過去、通州附近之日軍、於前（二十四日）晚大部東去、現均集結於燕郊鎭以東之夏墊地方、計該方面駐有日軍步騎砲各部隊、約一千餘名、坦克車及</p>

<p>當務之急　我們知道八十年來、中國由於帝國主義者之侵略、農村經濟、急連崩潰、新式工業無由發展、致使外貨充斥市塲、土產不出閭里、而日貨之傾銷尤爲國貨之最大障碍、此在商界同胞當尤知之更審、今日之計、非發展本國實業不足以抗强鄰、非澈底禁絕日貨、不足以發展本國實業、二十世紀之國際鬭爭、與其謂爲武力的鬭爭、毋寗謂爲經濟的鬭爭、吾人之欲</p>

<h3>南洋僑胞</h3>
<p>决一致反對郵資加價</p>
<p>新加坡華商會電滬華聯會</p>
<p>表示反對並籲請力予援助</p>
<p>關於南洋郵資加價問題、現悉交部决於七月一日起實行、遠東社記者、以過去南洋僑胞曾表示反對、特於昨午往訪華僑聯合會常務委員黄建中氏、叩詢該會對於是項問題所取之態度、曁南洋僑胞最近之表示、當蒙其見告如下、</p>
<p>郵匯手續麻煩</p>
<p>據黄氏謂、當局宣佈加價之理由、不外（一）因郵政經濟、受南洋金佛郎影響、（二）因欲取締銀信局、統一郵政系統、惟南洋一般華僑勞動界之痛苦、吾人及政府須加以體恤與原諒者、彼等多爲一般不識文墨之苦工、其收入薄、偶有十數元、即須匯回養家、如經郵局匯寄則須先化錢請人寫信、然後赴郵局納匯費、繳掛號金、以及其他種種手續、信欵尙未寄出、即已化去二元之譜、待信欵到達後、郵差送至鄉間、又須会力錢四五角、總之每匯十數元、即須消費三元、試問一般勞動界、如何能負担得起、於是銀信局乃即應運而生、</p>
<p>信局至爲便利</p>
<p>銀信局爲一種商業組織、專藉銀水之漲落爲營業、匯寄信欵者祇至一銀信局、說明匯寄何處、匯銀若干、由銀信局免費代爲寫信、且無須分文匯費、信到目的地後、又可代收信人寫回信、亦不必再須任何手續費、總計匯欵十元、祇須費五分郵資而已、此乃銀信局之便利、而爲一般人所樂就也、按銀信局寄信、每百封信一包、每包貼郵票五无若果加價後、則每包非十二元不可、當然必爲一般僑胞所反對也、</p>
<p>本會所取態度</p>
<p>查南洋郵資加價、本欲於四月一日起實行、嗣因反對聲浪甚高、遂即延至五月一日、待至五月一日、交部又表示暫緩、日前本會派員晋京調查結果、得悉交部决宣佈、自七月一日起實行、乃即電知南洋各華僑團體、並派員赴厦門汕頭等地、向各該地銀信業同業公會報告、本會旣爲一華僑團體、當然應爲僑胞謀福利、對於南洋郵資加價一層、决與海外各華僑團體取一致態度、始終表示反對、</p>
<p>華僑一致反對</p>
<p>海内外各華僑團體、自接得本會報告後、已先後有函電到達本會、表示决一致反對、並籲請援助、頃接新加坡中華總商會發來一電、言已、即檢出該電示記者、特爲照錄如下、（上略）微（五日）代電悉、郵費若增加、則僑胞負担加重、僑眷生活難賴膽養、經電僑委會、交通部、軫念僑艱、准令緩辦、貴會關心同僑、請人呼籲、力予援助、至爲感禱、</p>
<h3>聯安公司台州輪</h3>
<p>在海門口外爲盜騎劫</p>
<p>擊斃水警等三名傷旅客三名</p>
<p>全船被刦一空臨行綁去二人</p>
<p>損失甚鉅公司公電嚴緝海盜</p>

<p>海盜混入</p>
<p>聯安公司所屬之輪船、計舟山·達興·穿山·益利·大華·台州·等六艘、專行駛上海·定海·海門·石浦、台州輪載重一千二百噸、爲台州商輪公司所有、於本月二十四日禮拜三下午六時、由海門滿載旅客曁貨物駛滬、旅客中混入海盜十一名、至下午八時駛至海門口外南北澤地方洋面、離海門十五里、混入之海盜、各持槍械、首先勒令船主許君曁老軌駛至郎磯山大陳山之間、</p>
<p>傷斃旅客</p>
<p>定海水警局武裝水警二名、因公赴海門、搭台州輪返定海、混入之海盜、深恐水警抵抗、先乘其不備、發槍狂擊、於是水警當即斃命、同時旅客三名、茶房一名、流彈受傷、旅客中之由海門回石浦之女孩十三歲、當即重傷斃命、一時秩序混亂海盜即開始搶刦、</p>
<p>洗刦一空</p>
<p>台州輪爲海盜　勒令駛至郎磯山大陳山之間匪窟洋面、海盜再勒令停泊、匪船十餘隻、均載海盜、紛紛登輪、任意洗刦、達數十次之多、搭客船員雜物衣件銀洋、均搶刦一空、連鞋襪之稍好者、亦統行換去、旅客稍不服從、即遭毆打、其兇惡異常、</p>
<p>臨行綁人</p>
<p>海盜在輪　洗刦達二十四小時之久、槍刦已空、船員旅客、均單衣赤足、始登小船、返郎磯山大陳山匪窟、臨行時將旅客二名綁去、登小船後、復將綁去之一姓王旅客放回、至二十五日下午七時、台州輪始脫險、當即駛回海門、</p>
<p>脫險駛返</p>
<p>台州輪返海門後、即將受傷之旅客茶房三人、送海門醫院醫治、幸傷勢尙輕、不致有性命之虞、至爲匪擊斃之水警二人、女客一人、當即報騐收殮、同時報告台州信記商輪在海門之總局、由總局分電定海石浦、曁當地軍警當局、嚴緝海盜、至於該總局董事朱道及得報後、即由定海趕返海門辦理、并電滬聯安公司報告、</p>
<p>損失甚鉅</p>
<p>該輪洗刦後、計台州輪賬房間、爲刦去水脚洋八百七十五元五角、客票洋四百元、由海門赴滬辦貨之商人三十餘人、損失二萬餘元、至於船員旅客雜物衣件銀洋損失、一時無從統計、聯安公司之舟山輪、於昨日由海門抵滬、船主當將台州被刦經過詳情報告、</p>
<p>嚴緝海盜</p>
<p>新聲社記者　昨晤台州商輪</p>
<p>分人以司曁舟山輪船員、據稱、此次台州輪、不幸爲盜騎刦、損失甚鉅、已由海門總局分電嚴緝海盜、台州輪决定於本月三十一日、由海門駛滬、下月二日抵滬、</p>

<h3>兩路縮短列東時間</h3>
<p>列車號次行車時間均有變更</p>
<p>已呈准鐵部定六月一日實行</p>
<p>中内社云、京滬滬杭甬兩路營理局車務處、因奉局令縮短特别快車行車時間、及參照機務處規定各列車之行駛時刻、編製第二號行車時刻表、已由局呈准鐵道部、定於本年六月一日起實行、表内所有各上行列車改以雙數編號、下行列車改以單數編號、以期符合其他國有鐵路列車次數編號辦法、而示一律、茲將各路改定時刻分述於後、</p>
<h3>京滬線</h3>
<p>縮短特快行車時間</p>
<p>新訂各特别快車、内除第五六兩次夜特别快車外、其第一四兩次特别快車、（即現有之第二三兩次特别快車）行駛時間、各縮短至六小時又五十分、每列車掛車規定以十二輛爲限、均用太平洋機車拖駛、第三零二次及第三零一次上下行平滬聯運特快車、其行駛時間、亦已分别縮短至七小時又四十分及七小時、上行第二次本路特快車、其行駛時間、亦縮短至七小時、</p>
<p>增駛滬平聯運特快</p>
<p>增駛上行第三零二次滬平聯運特快通車、經與津浦線當局商定、於每日上午一時、由上北站開、八時四十分抵京、因該路上行夜特快車開駛在前、而津浦線當局、不願聯運旅客在浦候車過久、故該列車開行及到達時刻、實未能再爲提早、所有車輛、將來當用各路所組織之聯運列車行駛、惟在京浦間輪渡未開始之先、擬暫由該路自備車輛、計頭等及二等客車各八輛、三等客車四輛、行李司軔車二輛、及其他郵件車及包件車並祇發售本路之客票、至在京浦間輪渡未成以前、該聯運列車、即以現有之第四次本路特快車車輛行駛、其行駛時刻、經與津浦當局商定、擬於十七時二十五分自京開行、翌日零點二十五分到達上北站、同時亦限定祇發售本路客票、（註）在津浦線時刻表未曾改訂完竣之先、所有滬平間聯運旅客、仍以第一四兩次車（即現有之二三兩次車）送接</p>
<p>取消由滬駛京午車</p>
<p>該路現爲節省機力起見、擬將現有之上行第十一次由滬駛京之午快車取消、即將所省機車供給行駛新增之上行第三零二次滬平聯運特快車之用、至該午快車取消後、對於滬京旅客、並無不便、緣按照現下行車時刻表規定、該午快車在滬至鎭叚内、停留車站較多、過鎭江後、即直駛南京、沿途並不停留、由滬赴京乘客、儘可乘十五時十分由上北開駛之上行第二次、（即現行之一次車）閘京聯運特快車前往、因特快車行駛時間縮短、到京時刻、與原有午快車相差無幾、</p>
<p>滬常區間展至鎭江</p>
<p>上行第十一次由滬駛京之午快車取消後、爲補救自滬至鎭叚内各站乘客便利起見、决將滬常區間車展至鎭江、改爲滬鎭區間車、此項區間車、擬改於十二時十五分自上北站開行、於二十點十分到達鎭江站、如是則現有之第十一次快車乘客、即可乘此項區間車前往、雖將該午快車取消、亦無妨碍、至現行之下行第二十二次常滬區間車、則改爲下行第二十一次鎭滬區間車、自鎭江站開行、其目的係爲减少下行第七次京滬早快車（即現行之第十次）之擁擠、定於七時零五分自鎭江站開行、十五時到達上北站、（註）上述之鎭滬間區間車、均係爲顧及和旅便利之辦法、惟在鎭江車站、應有設備完竣之先、鎭滬區間車所用之機車、須由常駛往、滬鎭區間車所有之機車抵鎭後、須由鎭返常、在此往返途中、機車勢必倒行、故須照定章辦理、將行駛速率、限定爲每小時四十公里、此點車務處正向管理局請示中、至現有之下行第四次京滬特快車、將來改爲第三零一次聯運列車後、其自京開駛時刻、須延遲至十七時零二十五分、爲便利自京至錫叚内各站旅客起見、擬將見有之京錫區間車提早於十四時、自京開行、如自京到鎭叚内各站旅客、如嫌離京時間太早、則尚可乘坐最近添駛之下行第二十五次、（即現有之二八次）京鎭區間車、　　京鎭區間行駛有待</p>
<p>路局因南京旣係首都、鎭江又爲省會、相距雖邇、但客旅頻繁、故决新增上行第二十六次及下行第二十五次鎭京間區間車、以便利旅客、惟須鎭江車站應有之設備完竣後、再行開駛、</p>
<p>上行特快改遲開車</p>
<p>查現下之第三次特别快車在途中與現下之第七次早快車時間相距極爲密邇、時有超越这可能、將來特别快車行駛時間、又須縮短、爲避免在途中追出起見、擬將該第四次特快車、自上北站開駛時刻、改遲至每日上午十時、與由京開行之第一次之時刻相同、</p>
<p>夜特快車上下一次</p>
<p>夜特快車規定祇行駛上下行各一列、已得機務處長同意、以省機力、而利行車、對於秋冬兩季暖氣設備、並由機處長表示均無問題、</p>
<h3>淞滬綫</h3>
<p>淞滬以綫增十二次</p>
<p>淞滬支綫、現行列車次數、計上下行共二十八次、比月以來、該線客運情形、日漸進步、爲便利行旅往返計此次新訂之時刻表内反有列車次數、擬增至上下行共四十次、用蒸汽車兩列、及普通機車拖掛客車二輛、輪流行駛、上項蒸汽車兩列之中、擬抽出一列、作爲備用、自經此次改訂後、該綫行旅、逆料當可便利不少、至貨運列車行駛時間、亦已遵照部令排入、計上下行各四次</p>
<h3>滬杭綫</h3>
<p>滬杭甬綫亦有改變</p>
<p>滬杭甬綫亦有改變、茲經調查如下（一）現有之第三十一次及第三十二次上下行閘京間聯運特快通車、改爲上行第二次及下行第一次閘京聯運特快通車即與京滬綫該項列車互相一致、（二）下行第三十七次（即現下之第四十次）三四等慢車、自上北站開行時刻、擬提早於九時五十分、俾免與京滬線之上行第四次（即現行之第三次）自上北站開行時刻相衝突、（三）前在計畫中之禾滬區間車、因機務處以機車缺乏、未能調撥關係、故仍未能恢復行駛、懐現有之第三十五三十六次閘滬間快車、其在禾滬段内行駛時刻、均含有禾滬區閘車性質、故於行旅方面、尙無十分不便之處、（四）其他各列車行駛時刻、除所停車站稍有更動外、其他大致與現有時刻表相同、</p>
<h3>越南華僑　捐欵慰勞宋軍</h3>
<p>越南美萩五帮華僑縮食救國會捐集大洋二千元、特由上海華僑愛國義捐總收欵處轉交宋哲元將軍、以充慰勞該部將士之用、華僑熱心祖國、可證一斑、</p>
<h3>稅務署　變更啤酒稅率</h3>
<p>改爲從量征收</p>
<p>下月十五實行</p>
<p>本埠財政部總務署、以國内製造啤酒、自民國二十年改爲駐廠征稅以來、稅收　有起色、推現行稅率、係按値百分之二十征收、於註廠開征時、應照市價估訂、實行以來、爲時已久、市價漲落無常、揆諸實際頗多參差、且從價定率、手續等級、稅額尤雖平允、茲爲劃一征收起見、所有國内製造之啤酒稅率、一律改爲從量征收、不論售價若干、凡裝箱四十八大瓶（卽夸特瓶）箱、或七十二小瓶（即品脫瓶）箱每箱即征收銀元二元六角、桶裝或樽裝者、以凈裝容量計、每一立脫征收銀七分、桶或樽之外面、均應標明凈裝立脫實數、以便查核、并悉從量征收稅率、定本年六月十五日起、全國同時實行、籍昭劃一云、</p>

<h3>讀者顧問</h3>
<p>如何讀書的問題</p>
<p>丨復揚州聞君來信丨</p>
<p>答：手敎並讀書計劃草案均讀悉。謹就謭陋所及，分來書與計劃兩部，略貢所見、以致敎於先生。</p>
<p>（一）來書部分　先生說「政經之學，本屬素習，無如大學時代，讀書無方，雖孜孜數載，而所獲至爲膚淺」，這話雖說是先生的客氣，然而就一般情形而論，也不能不說是客觀的眞理，但是我們對於現在大學的敎育的批評還不止此。在我們看來，現在大學的學生，不在「讀書無方」，亦不在什麽「膚淺」。因爲大學敎育本止本於敎生徒以研求高深學問的門徑，即所謂方法，並不是「道在是矣」，至於「膚淺」更不足爲大學生病。實則現在所謂文明國家的大學，所敎育的完全是官許的科學，尤其是社會科學，只是少數人的辯護狀，絕不能滿足我們求眞理的要求、歐美日本各大學找不出幾個眞正的爲大多數民衆而奮鬥的經濟學家，社會學家。先生若爲參考便利而赴日本讀書，計固良得，若是要進彼邦大學去做政治學經濟學的研究，那實在可以不必，這是一。依復們想來，研究政治經濟，若是以先生的學有素養的話，即在國内，多多買些參考書、也儘夠研究，而且現在政治經濟是要在日常的社會生活的鬥爭與政治生活的鬥爭中去研究，不是預備許多學費到外國去可以販得來的，即使販得來，也是「銀樣蠟槍頭」，這是二。所以我們現在，要請先生問一問自已··</p>
<p>（一）爲什麽要研究政治經濟？</p>
<p>（二）爲誰的利益，來研究政治經濟？</p>
<p>若果說，爲學問而求學問，爲自已的空虚而求學問，那都是欺人之談丨若果說、研究政治經濟爲的是解决中國，進而至於世界的問題，那就逼得你不能不先决定我這種研究是由個人的或少數人的利益出發？這一層决定後，你的觀點自然異常淸楚，研究的方法和研究的取材，甚至對於同一現象與材料，而觀察亦必卓然異乎尋常，這是三。</p>
<p>（二）讀書計畫草案部分　現在無論研究什麽科學，外國語是非常重要的，没有兩種以上的外國語的預備，簡直夠不上說研究，先生之補習外國語是對的。這是一。第一階叚所列各科都是應當研究的，自然不成問題，問題只在於你所資以研究的是那一派的經濟學，政治學，社會學等等··或是普研究各派而歸宗於那一派的經濟學，政治學等等。譬如經濟學原理罷，有資本主義的經濟學原理，與社會主義的經濟學原理之分，而社會主義之中，又有所謂烏托邦社會主義的經濟學與科學的社會主義經濟學的分别。這種門徑，若是稍一不愼，開始走錯了路頭，那就無往而不錯。這是二。第二階叚，在記者的意見應該如下··</p>
<p>第二階叚　專門問題之一般的研究；</p>
<p>（一）經濟制度與社會組織的聯繫</p>
<p>（二）農村經濟與農村社會的關係；</p>
<p>（三）土地問題，租稅政策與階級的關係；</p>
<p>（四）人口問題與生產關係，生產力及生產方法的關係；</p>
<p>（五）國際經濟與弱小民族的關係；</p>
<p>（六）勞動問題與工廠管理的關係；</p>
<p>（七）地方政權與市政問題的關係；</p>
<p>所謂「制度」就是組織之成文的表現，所謂「經濟制度」就是「經濟組織」之成文的表現，研究經濟制度就是研究他的組織，對象只是一個不是兩個。然而我們說研究經濟制度與社會組織的關係，其意義便完全不同，同時在學問上有了科學的歷史的聯繫。又如人口問題雖然與糧食問題有關，然而這種人口問題的法則，不是自古及今一成不變的，而是各時代有各時代的特殊的人口法則；至於現在（資本主義與社會主義社會）的人口問題與其說與其說與食糧有密切關係，毌寗說，與「生產關係，生產力及生產方法」有密切關係。至於「地方自治」這一問題，實際上，就是地方政權的問題，就是說，以那一羣人做中心來領導這個地方自治，因而市政問題也就各有不同。第三階叚我們以爲應該是··專門問題的中心研究··</p>
<p>（一）中國的人口問題與國際經濟問題（帝國主義的經濟與社會主義的經濟）的關係。</p>
<p>（二）中國人口問題之解决與其經濟組織之合理化的前途及必然的命運。</p>
<p>（三）都市與農村的對立之奥伏赫變（Aufheben），所謂奥伏赫變者，即是消滅他們的對立而融合他們的長處於一爐的意思，有人譯做「止揚」或「揚棄」，愚以爲音譯爲佳。</p>
<p>（四）中國土地問題的根本解决。（旣有前一條（一），即無需再言建設農村，因爲將來要消滅農村與都市的對立）</p>
<p>若果這種讀書計畫能以實施，那就在日本各地觀光也好，做研究的報告也好，翻譯或介紹名著也好，無施而不可，至於在日三年所注意的三件事，固然是很重要，不過我們以爲應該以「丙」條爲第一條，因爲只有深深了解日本的經濟政治社會的概况之後，才可以眞切地認識日本的民族及民族性，才可以認識日本維新成功之原因。至於要求「中日問題之合理解决」，那就非洞明世界歷史與國際的情勢及階級與民族之交織的複雜關係不可，僅就日本去觀察固然找不到這種合理的解决，僅就中國本身着想，甚至僅從少數人的利害上着想，也臺找不着這種解决的。</p>
<p>考察印度，蘇俄，丹麥的旅行是必要的，然而我們要問你爲什麽單要考察印度呢？爲什麽單要考察丹麥呢？美國不應當考察嗎？希特勒統治下的德國不應當考察嗎？安南不應當考察嗎？至於先生游學歸來的「專門著作及撰述」當然是我們這些渴望着解决社會問題的人所十二萬分地祝其早日降臨的。不過我們得有一種要求，千萬不要再給我們這些虚怯不堪的「阿斗」們增加什麽「桃花源」的幻想，也不要再拿外國少數人所玩弄的幻術來在我們這些「近死之心，不可復陽·」弱虫面前講什麽「愛好鄉村」或「都市欺僞」的聖的經丨是則所望於先生丨「不足爲外人道也丨」</p>

<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第四章　業務之情形</p>
<p>舊醫與國藥商的業務。在一般籠統目光看來。以爲必受新醫的排擠。而入於衰落狀態。然近十年的上海市中。可以說舊醫藥的業務反在全盛時代。爲什麽呢。因爲新潮流激盪得利害。無形中引起了舊醫藥的掙扎。掙扎的結果。反而有一時的旺盛現象。但是業務只管旺盛。而學說不復存古。祇要看許多舊醫。滿口用着新名詞。什麽「腦膜炎」。「膀胱炎」字樣。手中執着體溫計。考究什麽「高三分降四分」。診色中備着Nat.Cacodylate替人打打補摁針。逢到急病。必請病家再請西醫打强心針。或則利用血淸的功效。而保持祖傅喉科的信譽。甚而至於開起中醫醫院。以動人觀聽。凡此種種。那一樣不是去古維新。露骨掙扎的表現。好在社會人民正有些猶豫不决。用全舊的方法。似乎没有享受現代文明。用全新的方法。又向來没有這麽胆量。於是乎正需要這種掙扎式的時醫。而時醫業務自然發達了。因此有人說丨舊醫藥今日的旺盛。乃是搖動的旺盛。市非堅守的旺盛。就上述數項舉動。足見舊於體溫計的功用。新病類的發生。强心針白喉血淸等的效力。都已默認確切。不過不肯明說稱讚罷了長此掙扎。終歸同化。却是絕好的現象。不錯。從前日本由漢醫改入科學醫。亦有這一種過渡階段。然而他們却是政令來得好。在統一的醫制之下。即使你參用舊法。政府只當你新的看待。所以日本醫學有。今天這麽一天。可笑我們中國。偏弄什麽國醫館。惟恐其學制不紛亂。而實在舊醫之對於國醫館。分明也有二種大不同的期望。有一種最守舊的舊醫。當然希望研考古法。保存國粹。（這一派舊醫行使業務至今還守首老法决不謬阿時好）而大部份的舊醫。和似僅非　的大老們。都未始不想參用新法。專造過渡性的醫者。來適應過渡性的社會。這一種人的心理。簡直希望中國一切。永遠飄泊乎中流。不過而不渡罷咧。結果呢。最守舊的舊派。爲此輩利用了一陣。而仍舊被排擠而已。</p>
<p>前淸光宣之間。各處新學大興。一般老輩。挾着可笑的目光。恐怕此後將没有人會寫字而和詩詞古文了。於是開了幾個存古學堂。如今那些存古學堂。本身已經多年不存。然而二十年來詩詞歌賦。雖不足以立國。也没有成絕響。而能者偏存古學堂出身啊。國醫館的最舊派。觀於這個例子。也就可以悟道了罷。</p>
<h3>聞余子維先生遺囑解剖遺骸敬告或人（上）</h3>
<p>— 作雲岫</p>
<p>病理解剖，是醫學上最重要的一件事，没有病理解剖，實地醫學是絕對不會進步的，譬如現在我國普通呌做中風的病，幸虧東西洋各國能夠實行解剖，方才曉得是腦出血，醫生不必說，連一般門外漢都知道了，這是因爲中風病的病理解剖，實在見聞得多了，所以都以能夠知道。要是没有這個病理解剖工作，恐怕到了現在，還是像我們貴中國貴國醫們，說是有外中内中，分做中經中絡中藏中府，并且說他的原因，是火是氣是痰濕，閙得天花亂墜，頭痛目眩，你是我非，莫衷一是。這是他們没有看見病理解剖的時候中風病的實在病象是什麽樣子，所以只顧亂說，無人過問，進一步講，也是社會一般門外漢，從没有聽見病理解剖，從没有看見中風的實在病象是腦出血，所以國醫們好種鬼話，得以欺暪得住，這是一件明明白白告訴我們的事實。</p>
<p>傅染病中的霍亂，丨不是我們中國前淸道光以前的舊醫所演「濕霍亂殺人少」的霍亂，丨是殼霍氏到埃及去研究的時候所發明的他把霍亂病人，施行病理解剖，發見了腸中的變化，并且發見了小腸裏面有弓形菌，後來轉到别處霍亂盛行的地方，再把多數的霍亂病人死屍，用病理解剖·來澄實這個弓形菌，確是流行性霍亂的病原菌。到了現在，賆</p>
<p>就用這個弓形菌做成預防注射的溶液，來打防疫針，他的功效，已經爲世界所公認的了。去年霍亂的兇燄，閙得那樣利害，但是上海一隅，病的死的，比較起來，還算是少數，這就是厲行豫防注射的功績。可知弓形菌的豫防溶液，救得多少人，眞是恒河沙數似的，不可勝算。要是埃及人　不肯犧牲屍體，殼霍氏不能實行多數的病理解剖，未必能發明弓形菌，未必能證實弓形菌是霍亂的病原菌；那未當然没有豫防注射藥的出現，也就是没有積極施行防疫的工作。到了今日，也許仍舊把打醮賽神，當做豫防利器就算了，這又是一件明明白白告訴我們的事實。</p>
<p>從第一件事實看來，可以曉得没有病理解剖，是永遠不會明白實在病象，各國的人們，在病理解剖未曾實行以前，害病死了的人，究竟死在那種病的手裏，都是莫明其妙，眞可以說是「死得不明不白！」我舉兩個例給諸君聽聽··第一個例，是我們寗波巨商徐囗囗先生，徐先生患了胃病，敎我去診視，他的病症，是常常嘔吐胃痛嘔出的胃内容物是有酸味，但是常常帶血，作咖啡滓渣的色，而且異常發酵，有腐敗氣，我斷是胃癌，然而其他的醫生，多有說不是癌的人，他們的理由，是胃中有鹽酸，并且皮色不很枯竭的樣子丨惡液質丨後來用愛克司光照起來，胃中竟平滑圓潤，絲毫不見凹凸不平的地方，據愛克司光線專門家說··「决定不是胃癌」，我看了愛克司的胃部照相，也覺得希奇，但是幽門以下，是一點兒也照不出，我就說··「幽門以下方面，還是靠不住」，但是心中也懹起疑來，或者是我的診斷錯了罷。後來幽門的狹窄越發厲害了，竟是完全閉鎖了，没法想，只得請敎外國著明外科專家好手，來用手術，那裏曉　開腹一看，幾乎幽門以下的腸部，全體没有一處不是癌，竟至無下手處，不過幾天，就歸天了。我聞了這個信，方才確實有了解番釋，徐先生的癌，因爲不在胃部，所以胃的愛克司映像，是平滑無凹凸，而且鹽酸分泌，也不見得絕對消失，至於没有恶液質的話，因爲徐先生養尊處優的關係，惡液質本來不是癌診斷的唯一證據。後來到了領帖一天，我去吊喪，徐先生大公子就問我道··「假如不用外科手術，你想總不會死得這樣快罷？」我就說道··「照開腹後的診斷，確實是癌病了，而且蔓延得不可收拾，可見得令尊的毛病，是一定没有希望的了。即使不用外科手術，不過敎病人多受二十天三十天的痛苦就是了，濟得什麽事呢？照我說來，幸而用外科手術，現在可以知道令尊的病，是一定没有救星，爲人子的，心力也算是用盡了。病的本態，也透澈明白了。要是不然，到了今日歸天之後，一定還有許多猜疑，許多懊悔，說當時用某種法子，或者有救；請某人醫生，或者會好；并且到底是癌不是癌，我們醫生裏，也是許多莫明其妙，現在有了眞憑實據，欵團可以消散了，不但死者自知命該如此，就是爲人子的，爲親友的，也坦然明白確是不救之病，倒也可以減少一點悲傷。」我說了這一番話，徐先生的大公子點了點頭，似乎表示接受，其實我的話，句句是實在情形，我們貴國人死得不明不白，不知多少哩。死了以後，還是論長論短，晦氣的醫生，給他們病家批評得那味藥太熱，那個方太霸，那枚針太利害，紛紛聚訟，弄個黑白不分，玉石俱焚，到了蓋棺論定，入土爲安，這件寃獄，是永遠没有昭雪的日子了。這種欵案在我們貴國，不要說一年之中，就是一月之中，一日之中，我也得碰着好幾回，没有眞憑實據給他們看，診斷錯誤的醫生，那裏曉得錯誤，見解準確的醫生，誰來證明準確，無怪乎國醫們火呀　濕呀·靈呀·痰呀·亂呌·老婆婆們鬼呀神呀　狐狸呀野貓呀·瞎說，因爲没有澈底淸查，所以弄得衆楚亂咻，像徐先生這個例，我覺得看過他病的醫家，得了許多有益的敎訓，連我最初診斷是癌的心思，幾乎搖動，不能自持，也受了敎訓不少，眞是感謝萬分啊。（未完）</p>

<p>傳曰··「民可使由之，不可使知之。」一蓋黔首之中，良莠不一，知識之高下，道德之隆汚，父子不相及，夫婦不相等也。夫法律之設，所以濟禮敎之窮，蚩蚩之氓，敎育弗及，自私之外，罔知其他，作奸犯科，更所不計，所謂公衆應守之規則，固已視若弁髦，使苟無法律之制裁，將益縱焉而莫知所止，「導之以德」，不若「齊之以刑」，雖古昔儒家之所非，以爲有違於王道，今茲學者之所詆，以爲有損於民權，然以吾觀之，民智未全開之時，敎育未普及之際，權利之界限，未得而明，自由之範圍，未得而定，則法家之言固示可盡廢也，過與不及，胥有背乎中庸，法律本爲人民自由之保障，固在用之者之得其道否耳，本此原則，以言衛生，而吾之建議如下··</p>
<p>中國衛生行政之不講也久矣，雖國府定都以來，漸知注意及此，設署焉以統之於中樞，設局焉以施之於各市，而數年之久，成效未昭，言衛生，未書不拊膺而長歎也，人民衛生知識之卑下也亦司云極矣，雖吾輩醫師，從事於此，報紙有醫學之副刋，雜誌有衛生之專</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>載，文字之宣傳，筆乾墨竭，口頭之勸導，舌敝唇焦，而言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，以二成績，則有令人汗顏者矣！考之以往古之明訓，證之以當前之事實，然後知民之愚者弗可以理喻，法之善者，固無傷於天和也，夫空言無補·則實效難收，法律之制裁，殆爲唯一之有效方法，略舉辦法三則，以待當局之挅納焉。</p>
<p>（一）公佈各衛生法律，通令全國各機關各商店各工廠各家庭，一律遵守。</p>
<p>（二）訓練高等衛生視察人　員分配各地，其職務如下</p>
<p>（一）視察家庭衛生狀况。</p>
<p>（二）調查學校衛生。</p>
<p>（三）調查各機關（如監獄·工廠·醫院·等）之衛生設備與狀况。</p>
<p>（四）檢騐娼妓。</p>
<p>（五）巡視輪船火車衛生狀况。</p>
<p>（三）每市或每縣，訓練衛生警察若干人，分發各區職務如下。</p>
<p>（一）檢查屠塲及食物店食物擔，有無不合衛生規則之處。</p>
<p>（二）檢查各地垃圾及糞便之處所，是否合於衛生法律之所規定。</p>
<p>（三）檢查旅館衛生狀况。</p>
<p>（四）檢查浴堂及理髮店。</p>
<p>（五）檢查行人視有無隨地吐痰隨地大小便等。</p>
<p>以上所言，僅舉其例，漏萬之譏，自知不免，惟天下之事，利弊相因，古今無不易之成規，亦無盡善之良法，衛生人員之養成，固可收效於目前，而事涉行改範圍，烏在其能免於作弊也，流弊所至，於是公然敲詐，則誣害良民，私行賄賂，則隱匿不報，是非以利民者爲害民耶？救濟之道，又安容緩。概而述之，約有三項··</p>
<p>（一）提倡德育以訓練其人格。</p>
<p>（二）允許告發以揭穿其聆謀。</p>
<p>（三）組織監察隊以監視其行動。</p>
<p>所謂不衛生这處罰，其程序大約分兩部執行之，凡有違於衛生法律者，始則勸導或警告之，不聽嵵罰欵以儆其尤，罰欵所得，悉以充衞生建設事宜之用，而不移於他用，於寓禁於徵之中，有利國福民之益，豈非一舉而兩得乎？是在我衛生當局之實踐也。</p>
<h3>靑學士性醫學序</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>世界之結構。生物之遞代。莫不出以性。亦莫不出之以欲。孟子言性。首稱食色。然食色爲性欲混合體。而非純性也。蓋性有個别。因物類而不同，而欲則共通，惟程度分等差而已，以言性，飽颺鳥性也，適芻馬性也，能水豕性也，難馴龍性也，逃寒見溫魚性也，不止林叢鴇性也，物性固各有其異矣，然而不能無良色之欲也，吾人雖靈，何能逸此，彼六根淸凈之我佛，言不生不滅，則似無性欲，又萬物無我之老莊，言無爲而治，亦似無性欲，然佛與老莊之八世，已不免乎性與欲來，處世，又難背乎性與欲立，以此責彼芸芸衆生，又安能使超越而獨異乎，是故，性欲與物俱來，猶魂之未可或離魄也，昔人論性者多矣，所惜半拘禮敎，半囿推儗，苟涉男女性欲，則力避不言，世稱張敝，對帝勿問床第間事，以爲穢褻行爲，不宜宣泄廟堂，至聖達者，亦以學養後嫁，爲世所必無，而載諸經傅，流諸後世，傅爲美談，於是數千來，人道之不滅，不滅於秘密之中，生育之繁庶，繁庶於秘密之中·而不自知其何以然也，今也，科學日進，穿鑿人生，天演競存，整飭血族，而强種優生之說，紛然並起，學者窮源探本，遂注目於先生天殖問題，所以改良種族始，必先精究生殖構造機關，與夫性欲宣泄途涇，庶幾人顃有所循守，靑年免入岐途，有陷阱者，知所自拔，爲領導者，可訓後人，因是，各國關於秘尿一殖器科，今日已邁進至於獨立，顧我繩墨舊尚，社會諱言，迄今完善專書，依然缺乏，有三五斷篇殘集，皆　幅拾零，非吾道正鵠之作也·錢挹靑學士，折肱於此，歷久星霜，秉其如椽之筆，成此美善專籌，首叙生殖器構造，次述性欲之生理衛生，未集生殖器各病治法，而殿以優生學，以是知著者之目的，正大而光明也，惟是今日優生學問題，方興未艾，且實踐厲行，未達時期，然而識者，以爲吾輩，不必親歷勝境，而允宜其抱願心，深冀社會人士，同界諸　，以讀詩三百之法　之，則錢君此著，爲不虚矣。</p>
<h3>最近的預防醫學</h3>
<p>— 吟閣</p>
<p>加爾密脫　與白喉的免疫同時成功者。有加爾密脫敎授所發明之結核免疫。氏亦於巴斯德研安所研究得之。如傷寒霍亂的細菌以藥品殺之（即以菌置藥液中）可成爲菌體浮游液。以此液注射於皮下。即可得某程度的免疫。以達預防的目的。獨結核菌不然。已死的菌體浮游液决不能作免疫之事。於是醫學界以爲惟生活的結核菌可以救結核病的免疫。然經幾多的失敗。大家都公認不能覔得無害於人體的生活結核菌。自柯霍發明結核菌以來。五十年間。未能有絲毫的發見。直至近時巴黎巴斯德研究所的老敎授加爾密脫與其高足弟子葛拉姆互相協力。始以毒力極强的結核菌。用氏所擬考案中的特别的培養基。幾番培養。到後來這結核菌遺傳的物理化學的構造。乃生變化。氏從事培養經十三年。孳孶不倦。不知其他。在歐洲中祖國危殆。砲聲隆隆聞於遠近。而氏在巴斯德研究所培養細菌。繼續研究不輟。最後乃得對於動物無毒的結核菌。且又確切證明動物體中對於結核菌可以作在成特殊的免疫體。這說一個譬喻裏。猶野生的動物。漸漸爲吾人所馴養。經幾百代之後。動物失其野生的本來面目。無害於人。而成爲家畜。加爾密脫所培養的結核菌。猶即是這無害於人的家畜。</p>
<p>加爾密脫氏以其高足葛賴姆共同苦心研究。始有成功。故即名此菌爲加爾密脫姆拉菌。以資紀念。在西文縮寫爲BCG三字。B即細菌。Ｃ即加爾脫。Ｇ即葛拉姆。</p>
<p>氏的實騐非常縝密。其順序先試这小牛。其後爲猿。兎。洋鼠等。遂及類人锆猿。其研究之範圍頗廣泛。其用意頗周到。至一九二二年巴黎醫科大學小兒科醫槐哀爾阿爾氏。始試用於初生兒。確證其無害而有效。及其實騐報告公表於世。法國婦女爭令其愛兒受預防接種。自一九二四年至一九三○年六個年中幼兒受預防接種的共有二十萬人。而幼兒的死亡率大减。</p>
<p>此預防接種的方汉極爲簡單。乳兒生後直日以内。結藥三包。每隔二日用之。以藥入小匙中。作成二西西的ＢＣＧ浮游液。於授乳前三十分鐘。即在胃中虚空的時候。混入母乳而飲之。此浮游液並無氣味。小兒可於不知不覺中飲之。服後亦不害腸胃。亦不發熱。全與飲乳相同。何以不用注射而可以免疫。因爲幼兒的腸與幼小動物的腸相同。通過細菌及抗毒素的能力非常之大。飲ＢＣＧ浮游液後。此細菌即通過腸壁。入幼兒的淋巴管中。運行全身。遂成結核病的預防免疫。依近頃的研究。在一歲之終。與三歲之終。均應將ＢＣＧ接種一次。其效力更確實。惟此時不若初生兒的腸壁可以通過細菌。故以一次的皮下注射代之。</p>
<p>天然痘有流行時期。結核病則無論何時均有感染的機會。可謂終年在流行期中。幼兒自出生後亦即有感染機會。故即須預防。至於年齡較大的兒童。或大人均可爲皮下注射。以預防結核病的傳染。</p>
<p>在法國小兒初生即可用電報或通信向巴黎巴斯德研究所購買菌苗。研究所得信即行發送。產婦普通在小兒生後第三日。第五日。第七日。或第六日。第八日。混和於乳汁令幼兒飲之。方法簡易。一般母親非常欣快。加爾密脫氏亦已得法國政府最高勳章。異常榮耀。</p>
<p>（編者按）肺結核爲人類之大敵。自發見結核菌後。全世界均注意於其免疫方法。而見效者極少。ＢＣＧ亦其一也。此法在法國。比利時。意大利等處。均有極著之成效。而英國。德國。美國等處。尚未見有詳細之報告。想必尙在研究之中。吟閣君此文。以極淺顯之文字。介紹最新之學說。用特刋佈。希讀者注意。</p>
<h3>科學的達生篇　（十九）</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（十五）外陰部的處置</p>
<p>（甲）不潔的結果</p>
<p>產婦在分娩後。外陰部成爲惡露粘液血液等排洩物的發源地。所以外陰部下肢腰腹等處。不免汚染難潔。甚至床褥　褸。假使稍不介意。就易遭受黴菌的侵襲。發生危險的變化。</p>
<p>外陰部不潔的結果。最重要的。就是產褥熱的起因。雖然產褥熱的發現。含有種種原因。但是發現的起點。當然是處置不潔。感受菌毒而來。譬如穩婆接生的手指。從不知消毒。或者。醫師助產士的手指。消毒不充分。分娩時。稷婆用積垢的器物。妄動不合理的剌戵。或醫用器械脫指棉等物。消毒不完全。惡露始終未凈。積垢集中陰部。於是黴菌直向子宮侵入。不日宣布產褥熱的發現。</p>
<p>從前的人。祇知道產後較胎前容易發病。由穩婆接生的產婦。即使在臨盆時。幸而不受宰割。可是在產後因病而亡的。也不在少數。這是由於完全不明瞭產褥熱原因的原因。所以在外陰部任意調度。胡亂渺視。及至發生危險。仍不明瞭這危險的由來。豈非笑話。在此時代。對此原因。不難普及明瞭。那末。對於分娩後的外陰部。應當充分注意。透加預防。才是幸福哪。</p>
<p>（乙）外陰部的淸潔</p>
<p>外陰部及其周圍。在分娩初期。就將消毒溫水。用軟布或脫脂棉洗滌。再用百分二的石炭酸水。或百分一的來沙耳液消毒。分娩經過。仍直時時洗拭。分娩後一星期内。亦須照此洗拭。如有創傷。可用代馬吐紛等灑布。然後再用消毒棉紗。罩覆外陰部。但陰道洗滌。須經醫師助產士之指導。分娩後若無異當症狀。亦無陰道洗滌之必要。</p>
<p>（丙）外陰部的裂傷</p>
<p>分娩時。胎兒通過陰唇的份。同時腹壓加緊。兒頭憑着自然之勢。脫頴而出。假使發生病理的變化。以至分娩延長。或兒頭遷延不出。那時。外陰部就要裂傷。又如高年的初產婦。軟部產道或變硬化。這也是外陰部裂傷的一種原因。若已裂傷。就該立刻加以極微的消毒。並速請醫。在裂傷部位。施行縫合。</p>
<h3>淸潔之科學的研究</h3>
<p>— 郭人驥</p>
<p>吾人生活與不潔相伴而進行。蓋以人體爲不潔之製造廠故也。吾人一呼一吸。即令大氣汚濁。瞬息之間。所御襯衣即已着垢。經營任何高尙之生活。未有能一日抑制其大小便之排泄者也。且也美女之鼻。亦有鼻涕。耳有耳垢。目有目眦。口有牙穢。吾人嘗譏豚之生活汚穢。然吾人生活。又豈能勝彼哉。吾人所居之處。亦未有因生活之故而成污穢者。然吾人能於閒暇之時。除去其不潔。是即人類之優勝於彼之點也。若對於不潔。毫不措意。則其勝於豚也僅矣。吾人所產生不潔之物。其於人體决無益也。不僅不必要。對於人生。增加不快。且爲他人所厭惡。至爲有害之事也。是以必須努力以驅除其不潔。而爲人生之愉快與美觀起見。必須加以研究而求一正當之淸潔方法焉。</p>
<p>感覺的不潔　普通吾人飲水而發見其中有一米粒存焉。輒感其水之不潔。實則何嘗直接有害乎。有好潔者。非裸體不久厠所。非盥洗其手三次不舉箸。此其感覺之敏銳超過常人之故也。彼之神經非生理的。而爲病理的。吾人名之曰潔癖。是實不足爲訓。潔癖之害。較之不潔癖之害。殊不少異。蓋求必要以上之淸潔。反有疎忽於重要之淸潔者。亦何益哉。蓋並無不潔之感覺者。或反爲至不潔且危險之物。决不罕觀之事。僅恃五官而判斷其淸潔。亦屬危險。此所以有左究之必要民。（未完）</p>

<h3>昨日決戰</h3>
<p>大專組中欄　此係繼第一日未了之節目、預赛無、開始卽爲决賽、航空靳懷智一馬當先、態度穩健、過欄極佳、無虚廢時間之弊、故得以六一秒二之良好成績、造浙省新紀錄、勝來極易、領前有二十碼、第二之江祝開元、第三之江胡銘仁、得達終點、極感勉强、</p>
<p>民衆組跳高　此亦繼第一日之節目、臨海余光昭以一米六二得冠軍、在平庸之成績中、亦算佼佼者矣、第二奉化戴禮澄一米五八、第三杭市嚴友滄、第四鄞縣何孝悌、</p>
<h3>男初洪用棠造千五百米新紀錄</h3>
<p>四分四二秒六</p>

<p>男高組百米　此項複賽取消、昨日卽行改爲决賽、預赛兩組第一之陳嘉瑞及傳俊、功夫相仿、均擬爭奪冠軍、但李守震亦不某雌伏、發揮精力、力爭前位、胡形勢頗爲繫張、第一卒爲陳嘉瑞、時間十二秒四、傳俊第三、李守震躍第二、殿軍爲高德培、</p>
<p>民衆組百米　此組亦無複赛、與男高同時舉行决賽、杭市陳夔章預賽成績最佳、决賽固極有希望者、優勝劣敗、難逃公理、結果陳卒獲冠軍、時間十二秒五、葛衢康追隨甚緊、得第二、郭喬治第三、何考悌第四、</p>

<h3>海市蜃樓</h3>
<p>— 曕廬</p>
<p>靑島前海最近發現着、海市蜃樓、高度和二層樓相等；上午下午湧現着兩次，哄動着人山人海的觀者、這是値得記載的事。</p>
<p>紀救山東沿海的海市蜃樓、昔人筆記上書不勝書。王凝齋秋澄叢話，有一段紀載登州海市的文字、似乎比今日的珮島海市，尤其可觀，我把來摘錄在後面··</p>
<p>「余鄉海市，惟登州蓬萊閣爲最；第春夏之交、濟風徐來，水波不興，人輒見之。市之現也，變態不一；或城垣隱起，儼然都會；或萬瓦鱗次，千門洞啟，擊轂肩，紛紛如織；或叢林浮屠。崢嵥殿閣，宏傑嵯峩，玲瓏耀目。或峯蠻矗立，夏木千章，異丹珍禽，宛如圖畫。順治初，有登州鎭總兵宴客閣上，酬酢方酣，突有艨艟無數，蔽海而來，舟中人皆戎裝荷戟。總兵驚，以爲海寇，卽撤席戒嚴。怱人舟俱渺，惟見海色天光，相與滉漾而已。」</p>
<p>本來，天下的事，都和海市蜃樓一般！靑島的海市蜃樓，上午的一次，經一小時例滅；下午的一次，經半小時便滅；天下事都作如是觀，待到滅了以後，眞眞幻幻，有什麽分别呢？至於，蓬萊閣上望見的艨艟戰艦，轉眼之後，只剩得天光海色！王凝齋的一段記載，倒是黷武窮兵者一服淸凉散。</p>
<h3>剃頭</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>不用以歷史考據，大家會知道古人底髮，都總束髻，艦在頂上。用冠𤲈，巾幘，帽笠等掩之。曾子還說··「身體髮膚，受之父母，不敢毁傷」，所以除了沐櫛之外，怕不會不剃髮那一件事。直到黄山谷的詩集裏·有過「身不出家心若住，何須更覓剃頭書」的句子，便使人懷疑了：丨這部書現已不傳，内容如何，不得而知。照李調元說，這書也許與唐朝的眼兒歌相彷彿。眼兒歌是剃孩子胎頭的短文，未必正確。由此，昔人究竟剃髮與否雖不易明斷·但以我看來，至多修修鬢脚與刮刮鬍髭而已。原因有二：（一）他們不願作削髮的和尙，因爲他們要忠君孝親。（二）他們更要周弁殷冔，飾成雍容華貴的態度，表示士大夫特殊階級的莊嚴。李太白的散髮弄扁舟，屈靈均的年髮行吟，這只是嫉世憤天以後要學習不懂禮貌的大自然裏的漁師樵夫而已！</p>
<p>這不剃髮的流風·一直到明代亡，便消歇了。淸朝却通令全國，跟滿洲的習慣，要漢人也拖起髮辮來，而且開始剃髮了。這是中國歷史上的一個很奇怪的轉變。記得有一位明代的儒臣，有着一首諷刺詩：</p>
<p>「聞道頭堪剃，而今竟剃頭，有頭皆可剃，非剃不成頭，剃自由他剃，頭還是我頭；請看剃者，人亦剃其頭！」這首詩的意思，是在說大明固然給你們亡了，然而你們也會給别人亡了的！倒底二百六十八年的社稷，給孫中山先生的努力推翻，於是乎中華共和民國成立於今二十有二載！不但辮子取消，竟剃成爲陸軍頭，與和尚差不多了。不但男子如此，而小姐和老太太們也把靑絲鬢髮剪去，　成雲鬟霧鬢了。</p>
<p>世界的事，就僅剃髮一端看，已變幻無極，莫測高深。何况到現在，被佔據的東三省，九一八以前，曾立過五色旗，繼着靑天白日滿地紅。而現在，又飛楊了靑龍紅日旗，變國號爲滿洲。恨淸傾國的稚王溥儀，竟扶爲正統！</p>
<p>滿洲國被日本的鞭策，在向我們進攻，同時江西的紅軍，也不信向南京政府脅迫：互相錯綜，國是破碎，你來剃我的頭，我也剃你的頭，各以其人之道，還治其人之身，若不本革命的精神去排除一切禍害，同時迎合時代潮流，革新政治，那中國不亡，的確是天没有眼！得倡多難興邦的人，以妥協手段，爲喪權辱國的創作，這種人，永遠不能剃人頭，只配把頭給人剃！</p>

<p>趙連長將父親面前的酒杯子拿過來，接著田青的酒，笑道：家父今天很高興，三位敬他老人家一杯得了。可是只能敬他老人家一杯。要多敬幾杯的話，那可只好讓我代表了。田青笑道：這麼著吧，我放肆一點，和老太爺來豁兩拳。酒還是讓起連長代喝。大家看看這個辦法，妥當不妥當？說著一面捲起袖子來，一面向殷關二人使著眼色。璨自強在一邊看到，早就明白了他的意思，因道？好罷，豁豁拳，也可以熱鬧熱鬧。說著，回過頭來向趙翁道：爹，你就跟他們豁幾拳罷。他們欺侮你老呢，你就和他們豁上幾拳。田青站著，依然不曾坐下去，伸著手，連連向趙翁伸了幾下道老太爺來來。好喝酒的人，對於有人提倡喝酒，那總是贊成的，也就伸出手來。向田青對於揮著。接著就五呀六呀，高聲大喊起來。趙翁的拳豁的很不錯，十拳之間，田青輸了七拳。於是殷得仁關耀武說著向前紅𢴣援和趙翁接著義戰起來。這一陣大大的熱鬧，把趙翁一大肚子牢騷完全遮掩過去。酒席吃過了趙自強就向關耀武道：父產到前面院子裏去，他心裏忽然一動，想到何以有這樣一個動議？莫非要我去和他說媒嗎？他倒是怕別個人注意，於是向趙翁道：我一進門就吃著喝著，前面我那親戚家裏，還沒胡去過。現在我該去𢪙個晚年，要不然人家現在家道貧寒，倒要說是我瞧不起人家了。他說著這話，已經站起身來向外面院子走去。他這一去，就發現了無數的曲折文章了　。（八四）</p>
<h3>扶桑識小</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>這是一位旅日有年的朋友講給我聽的，我就把它像記賬般的記在左面。</p>
<p>櫻花是日本的圃花，每歲櫻花時節，士女携榼，絡繹於道，大有舉國若狂之概。他們除了櫻花外，也很愛蓮花。上野公園的不忍池，亭亭凈植，都是絳白參半的鞭蕖。秋風送凉，蓮房綻實，但是他們從來没有　蓮實以充食品的，一任它萎枯以至銷滅。</p>
<p>生活程度，比了我國要增加一地倍。譬如鷄蛋每枚洋一角，米每擔洋四十餘圓，然也有很低廉的，如赤荳糕每塊祇銅圓二枚，和我國低級社會所吃的野鷄　子，同爲果腹妙品。</p>
<p>公園中大都有釣魚玩意兒。這種頑意，必須買劵，出了一角的代價，便可得一釣竿，淸水淪漪，隨意埀釣，確是一椿很有味的雅舉。但是這種竿兒，是用火烘釣過的，異常脆弱，貪心的朋友，喜歡釣着巨麟，不料竿不載重，動輒斷折，老門檻的，專釣小魚，釣了一尾又一尾，直至竿折爲止，可以釣到數十尾之多。由賣釣處奉送一個大玻璃缸，帶得游魚而回。</p>
<p>日本人都是愛潔成癖的，屋舍每星期大掃滌一次。就是到了署天，板壁中從没有蠕蠕的臭蟲出現。在他們口裏。不呌臭蟲，却名它爲南京蟲。這種難道是我國南京的特產麽？未免太武斷了。</p>
<p>日本人很喜歡吃中國菜。東京有中華樓，是一家純綷的中國菜館，我國的留學生，大都趨之若鶩，日本人也承認它價廉物美，常常邀朋約侶去大嚼。炒圈子腴美芳烈，尤合他們的口胃，圈子便是猪腸，因爲他們的廚子，都不諳猪腸是煑法，欲嘗異味，惟有到中華樓去。</p>
<p>入伍的軍人，必需有相當的體重。徵兵的時候，往往有一部分人，故意數天不吃飯，餓得形銷骨立。這好比我國　昔詩人所詠的折臂翁。兵兇戰危，原是人人害怕的，無怪日人爲然。</p>
<p>櫻花娘露天洗浴，不足爲異，有時泳嬉海波，倦了便挖沙成坎，把赤裸裸的玉體埋掩其中，彷彿擁了一生衾被，據伊們說，是非常舒適，女性的神秘，旣完全打破，所以在彼邦僱一模特兒寫生，價値很廉，每星期四元，便可使伊裸體對坐終日了。</p>
<p>芝園，禁止華人和韓人入内，彷彿没有開放以前海上的外灘公園禁止華人與犬入内一般，他們禁止的理由，說華人和韓人隨地吐痰，容易傅染疾病，爲衛生上的一大障碍。</p>
<h3>俏皮話</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>祈禱和平丨某甲素性懼内，一日，因微事觸了夫人之怒，罰其跪在床前。適有友人來，見甲匍匐情形，驚問道：你作怎麽生？甲囁嚅首道：你不知我的苦衷，我正在「祈禱和平」咧！誘敵深入丨甲婦控某乙强姦，法民傳兩造質訊。乙請律師代辯，說當時甲婦並不加以抗拒，所以不得謂之强姦。法官隨問甲婦道：你旣然說他是强姦，爲什麽抱首不抵抗主義呢？甲婦答道：我並非是不抵抗，這是「誘敵深入」呀！</p>

<h3>民族之聲</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>在上月的「自由談」裏，ＸＸ先生寫了一篇「光棍哭妻」和「荒山淚」，據說這兩個小調兒曾作爲國歌唱給外國人聽過了，前者是大淸國的事，後者是當今黨國的事。兩者都是嗚嗚咽咽的東西，洋鬼子雖然不懂得其中的意義或詞句，但那可憐似的調子總會理解的吧。這種可憐似的調子，我想，不也就是中華的民族之聲麽？</p>
<p>中國現在是没有大家公認的國歌的，這好像是勢所必然，這個衰老的民族所正進行的路徑，一般人民生活的墮落，要有怎樣的歌調才能夠具體地表現出它來呢丨如果眞有偉大的作曲家實際上製作了莊嚴偉大的國歌，那歌曲能鋔代表這墮落到無可再墮落的民族麽？這個民族的生活，是必然地要它發出像「荒山淚」和「光棍哭妻」那樣的聲音來的。那不也就是它的民族之聲麽？</p>
<p>我們雖没有國歌，近幾年來却有男女老幼都能夠吟誦的歌調，這些歌調的代表便是「毛毛雨」一類的東西。起初是只流行在上海一帶，其後是全國風行了，甚至有許多小學校裏，把它們敎給男女小學生們歌唱了，但這些流行的典子，不和「荒山淚」與「光棍哭妻」是大同小異的麽？</p>
<p>但爲什麽這些新的嗚嗚咽咽的調子，那般迅速地流行了全國呢？丨因爲它是恰恰適合了這個民族生活的呀，恰恰適合於這種悠間無聊的歌曲的民族生活，我們想，那是怎樣悠間無聊的民族生活呢。</p>
<p>新的藝術批評家們，分析歐美最近最流行地「爵士音樂」“Jazz　Band”說它是表現資產階級的勝利的音樂，那麽我們的這「毛毛雨」，又是表現什麽的呢？我們說它是表現我們民族的死亡之音，不也可以麽？</p>
<h3>闇夜</h3>
<p>— 郁逹夫</p>
<p>什麽什麽？那此東西都不是我寫的。我會寫什麽東西呢？近來怕得很，怕人提起我來。今天晚上風眞大，怕江裏又要翻掉幾隻船哩！啊，啊吓，怎麽，電燈滅了？阿，來了，啊呀，又減了。等一忽吧，怕就會來。像這樣黑闇裏坐着，倒也有點味兒。噢，你有洋火麽？等一等，讓我摸一枝洋蠟出來。……啊唷，混蛋，椅子碰破了我的腿！不要緊，不要緊，好，有了。……</p>
<p>這洋燭光，倒也好玩得很。嗚呼呼，你還記得麽？白天我做的那篇模仿小學敎科書的文章··「暮春三月，牡丹盛開，我與友人，游戲庭前，燕子飛來，覓食甚勤，可以人而不如鳥乎。」我現在又想了一篇，「李生夜讀甚勤，西北風起，吹滅電燈，洋燭之光。」嗚呼呼……近來什麽也不能做，可是像這種小文章，還做得出來，很不壞吧？我的女人麽？噯，她大約不至於生病罷！暑假裏，倒想回去一趟。就是怕回去一趟，又要生下小孩來，麻煩不過。你那裏還有酒麽？啊唷，不要把洋燭也吹滅了，風聲眞大吓！可了不得！……去拿麽，酒？等一等，拿一盒洋火，我同你去。……廊上的電燈也滅了麽？小心扶梯！喔，滅了！混蛋，不點了罷，横豎出去總要吹滅的。……噢噢，好大的風！冷！眞冷！……噯！</p>
<h3>兩種人以外</h3>
<p>— 李鯈</p>
<p>伯符先生把人分做兩種；散文氣質的人和詩人氣質的人。（見五月十七日自由談）</p>
<p>但我以爲這兩種人以外，還有一種戲劇氣質的人存在着丨丨而且最多。這種人旣不必拿自已去迎合世界，也不一定呌世界來適合自已；反正放手做去，總是左右逢源。他們只看機會，在這個時候彷佛像散文氣質的人一般的可愛；但在另一個時候却又儼然像詩人氣質的人一般的淸高。</p>
<p>没有這戲劇氣質的人們存在，世界便會顯得寂寞單調起來！因爲他們是一切悲劇的撥動者，又是一切喜劇的調弄人</p>
<p>歷史上，這種人的豐功偉跡記錄得最多。盛世，他們詞禮作樂，歌功誦廳，妬同儕，陷友好，替主子想法子開心。亂世，他們投甲毁乙，又投丙毁甲；「良禽擇木而棲」，不妨再投乙毁甲或丙。尤其是更朝換代的當兒，駡賊的是他，罰拆殉國的是他，降敵的是他，稱聖主的是他，忽然反正的又是他。「殺吾君者吾仇也，殺吾仇者吾君也」。祗要舌子一轉，便可做五朝元老。</p>
<p>富於戲劇氣質的人變化也最靈巧。你看他明明在那圈中，但其實不，你再看時他已在這圈外了。昨天我們是好朋友，今天我們在路上碰到可以呌巡捕抓你。若果明天革命成功了，我轉過來又還是你的老同志。</p>
<p>戲劇氣質的人最主要的特點，是有一條修煉好了的尾巴，該搖的時候搖，該豎的時候豎，該夾的時候夾，眞是無往而不利。法國詩人La　Rochefoucauld說：「人同狗一樣，也有長尾巴短尾巴之分。短尾巴的人有的是天生的，有的是自已不好。短尾巴的人處於鄰的地位………但長尾巴的人是快樂的。」方今是奬勵「自首」「告密」的時代，趕快修煉成長尾巴呀！如果不幸你的尾巴天生是短的。</p>
<p>所以，散文氣質人常是成功的人。（反面則横死的「成王敗宼」自古已然）詩人氣質的人常是寄生虫。（伯符先生語）獨有戲劇氣質的人是永遠勝利的人！</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（三十五）談鬼</p>
<p>春到靑楓江上村，故鄉應有未招魂。客中無賴姑談鬼，不覺陰森天地昏。</p>
<p>此予六年前春日無題絕句十首之一，當時不談國事，不閱新聞，朋友相見，惟以說狐談鬼，資爲笑樂，此詩即縮寫此等生活及其心情也。先父熟誦聊齋志異，常稱道蒲留仙之爲人，予之好談狐鬼，亦童而習之。猶憶畫首聊齋著書圖題詩一絕云··</p>
<p>姑妄言之妄聽之，豆棚瓜架雨如絲。料應厭作人間語，愛聽秋墳鬼唱詩。　　先父言蒲留仙有排滿思想，凡所言狐，皆暗詆滿人：狐，諧言胡也。此書初題狐鬼傳，懼遭時諱，始易今名。然而書中雖未嘗明斥當局，實以狐狸鬼蜮視之。當時文人不曲學阿世，以取利祿；即潛心古籍，考證經文，文字偶有不愼，輒興大獄。政府待遇文人如此慘酷，談狐說鬼，亦文人避禍術之一端也。相傅蘇東坡以文字得罪當局，謫居嶺南，不敢復近筆墨，日惟强人說鬼，以消永晝。或對以無有，則曰姑妄言之。說鬼以解祟，文人之用心亦良苦矣。</p>
<p>（三十六）「孔子與戲劇」補記</p>
<p>孔子與戲劇一書，搜采頗詳，茲更得兩條可以補記者。一爲宋孔宗翰事，其父道輔使契丹時，曾拒優人以孔子爲戲，彼復諫哲宗不宜令敎坊伶人以孔子爲戲，可謂有是父，乃有是子也。宋王闢之澠水燕談錄··「元祐中·上元，駕幸迎祥池，宴從臣，敎坊伶人以先聖爲戲。刑部郎中孔宗翰奏，唐文宗時，嘗有爲此戲，詔斥去之。今聖君宴犒羣臣，豈宜尙容有此？詔付檢官置於理。或曰，此細事，何足言。孔曰，非爾所知。天子春秋鼎盛，方且尊德樂道，而賤伎乃爾褻慢，縱而不治，豈不累盛德乎？聞者羞愧歎服」又一事爲明永樂九年成祖禁褻凟聖賢之詞曲，孔子當亦在不可褻凟之列矣。由是而言，唐宋戲劇初起時，即不許以孔子爲戲，明初戲曲發達時，復嚴禁扮演聖賢。無怪乎曲阜師範，排演「子見南子一戲，引起軒然大波。蓋孔子自漢武帝以來，二千年間，優受帝王褒尊，今忽於闕里之地，向孔聖人開玩笑，凡在孔族，其何能忍？此辱孔訟案之所由來也。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚　　虱（續）</h3>
<p>— Jules　Renaro作林取譯</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨丨眞的，紅蘿蔔鬚你眞使得我們莫明其妙了。已經到了你這樣的年齡，並且已經長到像你這樣大的孩子，你應當臉紅的。你的脚髒得要命我都不去說它，你也許回家來才見到。可是虱在咬你，你却旣不要求你的先生們給你弄乾凈，也不要求家裏的人來把牠們篾掉。請你告訴我們，你這樣讓牠們把自已活活的吃着，空竟有什麽樂趣。你那頭亂髮究竟也還有些血液呀。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨這是因爲篦子把我刮得難受的緣故。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨啊！這是因爲篦子把你刮得難受的緣故。好啦，你原來是這樣酬謝你姐姐的呀。你聽到他的話嗎，愛勒絲丁？這位文弱的先生不滿意他的理髮娘呢。我的女兒，我勸你馬上把這位志願殉敎者讓給他的寄生蟲去吃罷。</p>
<p>愛勒絲丁丨我今天就是這樣算了，媽媽。我祗給他把最多的地方刮掉了，我明天還得給他篦第二次。但我認識一個女孩子頭上有虱却還會洒香水的。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨别人不去管他，至於你呢，紅蘿蔔鬚，你給我所這個面盆拿去放在花園裏的矮牆上。這應當呌全村的人來參觀一下好使你慚愧。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚拿着面盆出去了；他把面盆放在太陽底下，自已在旁邊守着。</p>
<p>最先走近來看的是拿内特老嫗。她每次遇見紅蘿蔔鬚便停住脚，用她那雙近視而又狡猾的小眼睛觀察他，一面移動着頭上的黑色软帽，好像猜着了什麽事情似的。</p>
<p>「這是什麽東西呀？她說。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬞什麽話也不回答。她彎下身來看着面盆。</p>
<p>「這是一些剝了壳的小扁豆嗎？眞的，我簡直看不清楚了。我的兒子皮耶實在早該給我配一一副眼鏡的。」</p>
<p>她用指尖點了关點，好像預備送到口裏嘗嘗的樣子。照那情形看來，她確是不曉得裏面盛的是什麽。</p>
<p>「並且你站在這裏幹什麽？你顯得生氣的樣子，兩眼發呆。我可以斷言一定双有人駡了你，罰你站在這裏。聽我說啦，我雖不是你的祖母，但我却想着一些事情，可憐的孩子，我同情你，因爲我知道他們一定使你過着很苦的日子啦。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚把眼睛向四圍打量了一下，看他母親有没有在身邊，然後對拿内特老嫗說··</p>
<p>「那麽該怎樣呢？雖道這事和你有什麽相干嗎？你祗願管你自已的事情好了，讓我安靜點罷。」</p>
<p>像布魯脫斯（Brutus）一樣</p>
<p>雷辟克丨紅蘿蔔鬚，你去年没有像我所期望的那樣用功。從學校的成績表看來，你實在還可以幹得好一點。你却空想着，念著學校裏不許念的書。你的記憶力本來很好的，你背書的分數還不差，但你却不肯用心做練習。紅蘿蔔鬚，你以後該變得正經些才行啦。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨請你放心罷，爸爸。不錯，我去年確實鬆懈了一點。這次我覺得自已已經有著拚命用功的志願。我並不誇口說我的總分數在全班裏面可以考第一名。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨但總得試試看呀。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨不行。爸爸，那你要求得太過分了。地理，德文，物理，化學等項我都弄不好的，這幾門功課，成績最好的祗有兩三人，並且他們是專念這幾門功課的。要趕過他們是不可能的事；可是我想，丨聽我說啦，爸爸，丨我想對於國文一項不久可以考得第一名，並且以後不再讓人家搶去。我雖拚命用功，萬一仍考不到第一名時，至少我可以問心無愧，我可以像希魯脫斯一樣驕傲地寫着；啊，「操守」（Vertu）！你不過是個名詞罷了。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨啊！我的孩子，我相信你會要使用這幾個字的。</p>
<p>菲利克斯丨他說什麽，爸爸？</p>
<p>愛勒絲丁丨我也没有聽淸楚。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨我也一樣。再說一遍看看，紅蘿蔔鬚。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨啊！我没有說什麽，媽媽。　（未完）</p>

<h3>洋米徵稅與食糧自給　許叔璣</h3>
<p>自從去年以來，米價的跌落，實在出於一般人意料以外。推測牠跌落原因，大概說起來，則可分兩種··（一）外部的原因，就是（一）世界的經濟恐慌，（二）洋米輸入的激增；（二）内部的原因，就是（一）政治的未淸明，（二）經濟的不景氣，（三）社會的不安定，（四）農業本身的病態很多。至於米價跌落的結果，是怎樣的呢？農民經濟陷於困難的境地，没有力景去改良土地，生產力自然地要衰落。中國國民經濟的基礎，旣仍然築在農業上，農業是這樣，國民經濟的全體，自亦受其影響了。如今要復興農林就要如何去保持農民所唯一的生産物丨穀物價格。但要維持穀價，又是一個複雜的問題，斷非此短短篇幅？所能盡，茲先把米穀關稅的問題，提出來討論一下。</p>
<p>穀物關稅問題，在歐洲和日本諸國，爭論至數十年，已成過去。而在中國，却是一種新鮮的問題。要討論這問題，應先明瞭歷年洋米進口的　勢，且把民國以來海關貿易册的統計數字列下··（單位擔）</p>
<p>年次　數　　量　　年次數　　量</p>
<p>元年　二、七○○、三九一　十一年　一九、一五六、一八二</p>
<p>二年　五、四一四、八九六　十二年　二二、四三四、九六二</p>
<p>三年　六、八一四、○○三　十三年　一三、一九八、○五四</p>
<p>四年　八、四七六、○五八　十四年　一二、六二四、六二四</p>
<p>五年　一一、二八四、○二三　十五年　一八、七○○、七九七</p>
<p>六年　九、八三七、一八二　十六年　二一、○九一、五八一</p>
<p>七年　六、九八四、○二五　十七年　一二、六一六、一五四</p>
<p>八年　一、八○九、七四九　十八年　一○、八二二、八○五</p>
<p>九年　一、一五一、七五二　十九年　一九、八九二、七八四</p>
<p>十年　一○、六二九、二四五　二十年　一○、七四○、八一○</p>
<p>本表所列洋米進口，雖非逐年有規則的增加，而其增加的趨勢，可知其大概了。再廻溯諸前淸同光時代，更不勝今昔之感！卽同光年間，每年進口的洋米，只有光緒二十一年（一八九五年）和三十三年，（一九○七年）超過一千萬擔，超過九百萬擔的，只有四個年，此外至多不過七百餘萬擔，少則僅有六千餘擔（參看上海民食問題馮柳堂先生著二百餘年來洋米輸入概况一文），這樣比較一下，就可知近年以來，洋米進口的增加，實在爲數不少了。牠的原因，到底在那裏？</p>
<p>我國歷來對於洋米　輸入，不但不加防遏，並且設法奬勵。試把歷史上的事實來看，就可明白。例如淸雍正年間，暹羅米到廣東，淸世宗飭照粤省時價發賣，船中貨物，一律免稅；乾隆二十一年，又議定廣東福建商民運米議叙的條例，如廣東福建的商民自備資本，領照前赴安南暹邏等國，運米回省的，就照運米的石數多少，酌予職銜或頂戴。這是何等地歡迎洋米進口。到了民國，對於穀米麥玉蜀黍等進口。仍是免稅。另一方面，則絕對的禁止穀類出口，自乾隆三十九年（一七七四年），頒布防穀令六條，運米出洋者，予以極刑，以迄於今，雖禁令無其嚴，而米穀仍不能出洋。兩相對照。就可知中國歷代的米穀政策，一面歡迎洋米的進口，一面防遏本國米的出口，推厥由來，無非是一種尊重民食的趣旨，本未可厚非。不過洋米進口，雖有時見其必要，而不論何時何地，任其自由輸入，終不免有壓倒本國米的危險：米的出口也有時應該禁止，而不論豐歉情形怎樣？一概禁止出口，也非促進生產增加的道理。所以中國歷代相傳的米穀政策，的確是一大錯誤。</p>
<p>要討論洋米應否徵收關稅，有幾個先决的問題，應該預爲討論的，就是··</p>
<p>（Ａ）找國的米應否保護的問題　米爲我國主要的穀物，這是誰都知道的。世界各國，對於主要的穀物，除少數工商國外，大都加以保護，這種穀物，從國外進口的時候，均課關稅，輕重固然各國不同，要皆有保護的作用，尢其近年的「農業恐慌」，瀰漫乎世界，穀物關稅，更有與年俱增的趨勢。我們從萬國農會所編的一九三○年至一九三一年農業狀况中的兩個表（表從略）可以看到（一）德法童諸國，一九三○年的小麥進口稅，較之一九一三年的增加至一倍或二倍以上。（二）德國的穀物進口稅，一九三一年比一九三○年大增，若與倫敦及利物浦的穀物價格相比較，各種穀物進口稅的數額，除玉蜀黍另論外，大都超乎相當的穀物價格，這可見德國的穀物關稅非常之重了。其餘採用農業保護關稅的國家，也是如此。這非是無意識的提高關稅，因爲一九二九年以來，世界各國，穀物的價格大跌，牠的滯貨又多，各國都擬取「以鄰爲　」的政策，力謀向外傾銷，萬一甲國不提高關稅，乙國或丙國的穀物，便將乘虚而入，甲國的穀物，不免爲其所壓倒，所以不得不預爲之防。世界各國中，除少數的國家或殖民地外，都有米穀的進口稅，（參看上海市社會局編之上海民食問題中吳覺農先生著食糧進口與免稅問題一文）如印度暹羅台灣朝鮮等米穀生產較豐，而且有餘糧輸出，本不怕外國米的競爭，然而這等國，都有相當的進口稅。至如日本，本來不足自給，似乎應該歡迎外來的進口，然而爲防止外來侵入，以獎勵自國米的生產計，也有進口稅。返觀我國，去年（二十一年）各省秋收後，米價大跌，固然由於比較的豐收之故。然主要原因還不在此，一因各地的米商，以爲前年（二十年）長江流域有大水災，收成一定歉薄，米價必然飛漲，於是向安南，暹羅，印度，等處，訂購大批期米；不料却得其反，囤積的米，已是不能儘量出賣，進口的洋米，還是不絕而來，及至新穀登塲，農民又迫於經濟，爭相出售，米價乃大跌而特跌。再則我國的米，固然比較的豐收，而世界各國中米的輸出國，近年也都是「年占大」。試看下面所撮錄的一九三○至一九三一年的農業狀况中一表，就可明瞭。</p>
<p>亞細亞米輸出國（印度暹羅台灣朝鮮及南安）糙米產額（單位百萬Metrio　Ton）</p>
<p>一九二七丨二八　五九·七　一九二八丨二九　六三·六</p>
<p>一九二九丨三○　六二·二　一九三○丨三一　六五·○</p>
<p>原來國際的米穀市塲，由印度暹羅台灣朝鮮及安南供給的米，差不多占了全量十分之九，這五處米的產量旣大增，牠的輸出量，也隨之而增；可是一面亞細亞米的輸入國中，也有受世界經濟恐慌的影響，重要產品的市塲，很不景氣（如錫蘭馬來半島的橡皮，荷領印度的橡皮糖和咖啡等），因此購買力大爲减少。所以在外國方面，米價的跌落，更有顯著的現象。從一九三○至一九三一年的農業狀况中所登之米價指數表（一九二六年等於一○○，限於篇幅表從略）</p>
<p>觀之，外國的米價跌落，差不多减低一半，甚至有多於一半的，一九三一丨三二年間，外國米的生產量及價格，尙無完全的統計，不敢斷言。但民國二十一年我國洋米進口已有二千二百四十八萬六千六百三十九担，比之二十年的進口量，增至百分之一·八五·○二。卽在該年進口凈數中亦占了百分之十一·三六，造成中國自有洋米，進口以來之最高紀錄。（見國際貿易局第三四季貿易報告）可知我國的米價，固然大跌，外國的米價也是低落，而且外國米存貿較多，不得不向我國傾銷。所以現在的時候，如以爲内地米價大跌，洋米已不足憂，也是不錯的。因此米穀關稅，愈覺得有設立的必要了。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）我國的米是否足以自給的問題　假使我國對於洋米徵收保護的進口稅，米的進口，當然不如從前那麽容易，萬一各省自產的米，不够食用的數量甚大，仍不得不仰給於洋米，這個時候，要豁免進口稅，洋米將乘内地米價昂騰的機會，滔滔不絕地流入，内地的米產，當大受其打擊；要照常徵收保護稅，我國人民旣不得不食洋米，洋米也仍舊進口，關稅雖然可入國庫，而所收得的關稅，終轉嫁於内地的消費者，這是於洋米的生產者與運銷者無害，却加重消費者的負但，恐怕得失不足以相償。所以要徵收洋米的進口稅，我國的米是否足以自給？或不足自給，到底差得多少？這種問題，也須加以研究才對。查我國近十年以來，米的進口量，增加頗速，每年至少都在一千萬担以上，或近於二千萬担，連去年在内，達於二千萬担以上者，也是三次。如估計牠的價値，漏巵之大，眞是可驚！但仔細地考察一下，覺得洋米的進口量，雖然足以駭人，實則這些數量，在我國米的生產量中或消費量中，尙甚微少。因此我敢大胆地說一句，我國的米差足自給，就令不足，爲數也不多。要明白地解釋這個問題，非先知（一）米的現在生產量和將來可增量，（二）米的現在消費量和將來可增量，（三）米的現在栽培面積和將來可增的面積，（四）人口的現計，總數和增加率不可，可是現在没有這種統計，何敢侈口而談？不過要估計其大略，也許可能的，試略加說明如下：</p>
<p>假定我國每年米的不足之數，恰如米的進口之數，則自有洋米進口以來，每年數量，應該有規則的，就令因人口增加或需要增加，也應該逐年漸進的。可是按照前列的表，統賢民國二十年來，洋米進口的狀况，覺得忽高忽低，少有秩序；例如民國元年爲二百七十萬担，二年忽一躍而爲五百四十一萬担强，增加至一倍以上，八年及九年，均祇有一百餘萬担，而十年忽一躍至一千萬担以上，自此繼續地增高，十二年且達於二千二百餘萬担，十三年又忽降至一千三百餘萬担，十六年又忽升至二千一百餘萬担，十七十八兩年，旋復大降，十九年又差不多到了二千萬担，這樣地升降無常，顯然有别種特别原因，夾雜乎其中，决非平常年份，也須年年要一千萬担或二千萬担以上的洋米進口。所謂特另别原因，是什麽呢？因爲民國以來，虫害或水旱忣兵災，每隔數年，輒發生一次，或繼續地相互而至，以致許多省份，釀成飢荒，米糧告乏，雖然某省的米，或尚有餘，兩以省自爲政，禁米出境，就令乞糧有方，也因捐稅繁重，交通多阻，米不能如期而至；就令可以運到，量旣無多，價又特高，缺米的省份，價不如乞　於洋米，較爲直捷便當呢！例如民國址九年上海洋米的進口特多，就是因爲十八年江浙諸省災荒的緣故；又如去年洋米進口復　於二千二百萬担以上，也是爲慮　年大水災的影響。即就平常年份而言，洋米雖依然進口，而如把進口量看做我國米的缺少量，也是錯誤，何以呢？如前所說，我國和省的米，向不自由流通，某省的米，雖然有餘，却無以補他省的不足，例如專閩米固然不足，而該兩省的人，不喫湘鄂諸省的　米，偏喫安南暹羅的米，就是一種明證。所以單把洋米進口的狀况，來證明我國米的不足，已到怎樣程度，也未免失这粗疏。現在更進一步，檢討米的進口量，究竟占了我國米的生產量的消費量的若干％，這是於决定米能否足以自給的問題，最爲要着。按我國米的生產量，中外人士，估計雖多，但各方數字，相癧甚巨，不足置信。所以現在要檢討米的進口量，占了生產量的若干％，也是徒勞。茲姑置米的生產量和出口量於弗論，單反進口量和消費量比較一下，便可知每年米的進口量，够作一年中若干日的食糧，也可概算米的缺少額到了怎麽程度。據馮柳堂先生舉例的說法··「閩粤本來缺米，素賴洋米接濟，至其他各省，非極荒之年，洋米所需無多，姑以全國洋米進口數最多之年論，（民國十二年）折合成石，亦祇一千四百九十五萬六千六百四十一石，如以每人日食半升，照全國四萬萬人計算，約爲七日有餘之糧」。（見上海市社會局編上海民食問題九六頁）他的計算的原則，很是合理，不過民國二十年來米的進口量，年各不同，單就進口最多的年或最少的年計算，以之舉例則可，以之計算則不足，現在依照他的計算原則，把計算法修正一下，先從民國元年至二十年間米的進口量，求彵的每年平均數，可得一一，三二一、五○八、五担（每担一百斤），把牠改作石，（每石一百五十斤計）可得七、五四七、六七三石。我國人口統計，固然難得確數，姑以最近内政部的調查結果爲標準，全國總人口爲四七四、七八七、三八六人，假定全人口中要喫米的有关數，就是二三七、三九三·六九三人，（全人口中究有多少人喫米也雖明言；但是蘇皖贛閩越湘卾蜀粤桂黔滇等省的人，概爲喫米。茲據内政部的人口統計，就這等省份計算，他的人口數也有二萬三千九百餘萬人，已占了總人口數一半以上。雖這等省份也有一部分不吃米的，而這等省份以外，也有一部分吃米的，彼此似足以相殺，所以假定我國全人口中吃米的有半數，想無大差）。依普通估計，每人每天的食米量爲五合，那末，一天就要米一、一八六、九六八、四六五合，把這數除七、五四七、六七三石，所得結果，便可知二十年來第年進口的平均數，僅供六，三日的米糧。換一句話說，就是假定米絕不進口，我國只缺少六·三日的米糧。就全年的日數計算，這六·三日，僅占了全年的日數一·七二％，換一句話說，就是米的進口量，僅占了全年消費量的一·七二％。照這樣看起來，可知米的進口量，在消費量中，爲數甚微，如以爲民國十一年以來，每年米的進口最平均數，遠過於前十年的平均數，要採用二址年的平均數，似乎失之過少，那末，再求近十年來（十一年至二十年），每年平均數，可得一六·一三二、八八四、八担，照前述的同樣方法計算，可知每年進口平均數，也只供全國九日的米糧，就是米的進口量，不過占了全年消費量的二，四％，這數量雖然比前計算的多，却也不大。候厚培先生，據他的計算結查，也說··「洋米輸入，巾我國米穀消費量，約百分之四·三。」（見國際貿易導報第二卷第四號，食糧輸入問題一四頁）把這數和我的計算數相比較，雖然差不多相差一倍，也可見米的進口量在消費量中，實爲微少。由這等的事實看起來，假定我國各省，水旱不生，盜匪不起，外侮不來，農民能够安居樂業，力耕其田，现使各省間米穀絕丵對地自由流通，彼此互相調劑，不消說，農民能改良稻田，大增米產，就令依照土法，善自經營，我敢大胆地說··我國每年反產的米，差不多夠供全國的食用，我國不吃洋米，也不至於餓死；因爲米的進口量和全國的消費量的比例，旣如此其少，而全國的米每年耗於釀造和其他用途的，雖無確實的統計，可是牠的數目也很不少。如果我國都抱着臥薪嘗胆的决心，採用縮食的方針，就令稍有不够，也可代以雜糧，何必年年仰給於洋米？况且我國稻田，大有增收的餘地，我十餘年前，在北平農業大學講演「中國農業生產之將來一的時候，曾就蘇皖贛閩越湘卾蜀粤等九省的稻田，估計其增收量，如每畝可増收米一斗六合，該九省的稻田增心的總額，就可有一九、九二○、一四七餘石。這算法所用的耕地面積，係根據前淸户部則例，所得的數，本嫌其過少，然而已有這樣的大，可以知以上九省或其他諸省，如果廣具水利，增設水田，米產的增加，當遠超乎二千萬石以上，那末，不但不要吃洋米，並可把有餘的輸出國外。所以米穀關稅一量徵收以後，縱收以後，縱洋米因此减少進口，或絕不進口，於吃米的人，當然一無妨碍的，這又是米穀關稅應該實行的絕大的理由。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）米價應否提高的問題　或以爲米穀關稅，一旦徵收，恐必怕内地米價，必漸加漲，消費者當蒙不利，受益的人也未必是農民，在春夏間買米餬口的小農，或反因此呌苦，這固然有相當的理由。不過我國各省米的生產費和價格的比例，雖無精密的統計，大抵出入僅能相抵，甚至有虧本的。至如今年米價大跌，農民虧本，更不消說了。假定米價長此低落，來年誰都願再積稻呀！所以米價應該相當地提高。可是米價一提高，洋米便乘機而入。所以一面要設法提高米價，一面就須微收關稅，免致洋米進口的增加。况且把農產物價格和他種商品的價格比較一下，下抵農產物的價格，下落較速而且大；反之，上騰的時候，較緩而且小，歐美諸國，都有這種現象，我國也是如此，徵之各種統計，就可瞭然。照這點說起來，米價也應該提高一些。所以關稅徵收以後，米價雖然增高，也是理所當然，如謂關稅徵收，米價上騰的利益，農民未必有利，這是糧食管理法未能適宜地施行所致，並非關稅制度本身的不良（此中利弊頗爲複雜異日容當詳論）。尤有應該特别注意的，米的進口量，對於全國消費量的面分率，雖如前所述，爲數甚微，可是民國以來，洋米進口已較諸同光年間大增，最近數年間，更有增加的傾向、如果再不徵收關稅，聽其自由進口，如果本年設再豐收，米價不知要跌至什麽地步，將蹈英國小麥和日本棉花的覆轍呀？這又是米穀關稅的實行，無庸廷緩的一個理由。</p>
<p>由上面（A）（B）（C）項看來，我國米穀麕</p>
<p>關稅，應該徵收，已無疑義了。卽去年中央召集民食會議，也把穀物徵收關稅的原則通過。可是今年五月二十二日實行的新稅則，除了麵粉每担徵收兩角五分的金單位外，米穀大小麥的進口，依然免稅，這是何等意義呢！難道爲丁粤閩需要洋米接濟而不徵稅？則如本文各項中所述，固然調節得宜，不患没有飯吃。所以我的主張的進口米穀應該徵稅，但是要首先詳細地調查所年來洋米的内地米的價格差額，並且調查米的生產費和消費者的生計費，擬定標準價格，且與洋米最近的價格相對照，而依保護關稅的原則，酌定進口稅率。一方面各省米穀，應該絕對地自由流通，以調劑盈虚，不至某省忽然告乏，又須仰給於洋米。並須從速設法增加米產，向自給主義，竭力進行。這樣做去，米的保護關稅，可以永久維持，如其不然，恐怕這種關稅，將因一旦米荒，又須撤回了。這是最　注意的事！關於本問題我於二十年前，已曾提議及此，舊事重提，而米穀徵稅，尙有待於將來。</p>
<p>本文洋洋萬餘言，於米價低落之因果及洋米徵稅問題，闡發甚詳，洵爲傑作，惟本刋限於篇幅，不能盡載，容有節略之處，或影響及於原著文意，還請閱者注意！</p>
<h3>近五年來米價之變遷</h3>
<p>— 編者　周文杰</p>
<p>農夫之大宗生產物，穀物也。彼其所產之穀物，國賦資之，租稅取之，農民之生計賴之，大衆之生活仗之。是故穀物產額之豐歉價格之上下，所牽涉者衆，所關係者鉅。輓近五年以來之米價，有十七十八兩年之逐步騰翔，而有去今兩年之慘跌不振。今將届靑黄不接之候矣，存米尚苦於擁擠，若如今年穀物生育之過程良好，則未來之糧價，終難起色。農夫唯一之生產丨穀物旣不値錢，其他如絲麻等等，復皆不振，而一切用品，昔日所以自製自給者，今則受新工業之壓廹，反由都市中輸入農村，此農村經濟所以破產，農民生活所以日困也。</p>
<p>上海爲大都市，食糧仰給於外來，但亦爲内外糧食轉運之樞紐，其市塲之興衰市價之變遷，影響及於内外。本文所述，係據市社會局所統計之糧價，究其變遷，觀乎此近五年中糧價之狂漲巨跌於以見農商交困，民生憔悴，有由來矣。</p>
<p>民國十七年之糧價，尙屬平和，於農民及食户方面，均不覺其有何嚴重影響。全年粳米平均價（均以每石計，下同）價一一、一七元，最高價亦不過一二·○二元，而最低價則爲九·九一元。利米平均價爲九·三二元，最高價爲一○·○九元，最低價爲七·九八元。十八年粳米全年平均價已升至一三·五一元。其中以十月爲最高，計達一六·二八元，四月爲最低計僅一一·三四元。秈米平均價爲一二·五五元，最高價爲一四·九○元，最低價爲一○·八九元。以與十七年份相較，其最高最低數之相差，粳米每石計達六元三角七分，秈米每石幾達七元左右。蓋爲十八年稻作突受災害，故至出新時反見高漲，此亦常年所不經見者也。十九年春，以受十八年歳收歉薄之影響，米價繼長增高，在一二月間，已比十八年終每石高漲一二元之數。入夏以來，各省又有霪雨爲災，糧食更見極度恐慌。雖有多量洋米輸入，尚不能抑平米價，江浙内地米價之飛漲，更使内外人心惶惶，本市六月分之粳米平均價竟達二○·○五元，事實上每石有售至二十四五元者，以與十七年九月之平均價相較，幾超過一倍以上。及七·八·九月仍在十九元左右之數。十月以後，秋收豐稔，米　突然下降，十二月份之平均價，僅至一一·八四元。半年之中，跌落一倍有餘，狂漲暴跌，固所罕見，農民須以兩石新米，扺償靑黄不接時一石之米價，卽此一端，所受損失，已爲嚴重·至是年秈米價格最高之六月份平均價，亦達一八·七二元，九月以後，則　降，自一三·○六元跌至一一·三二元，則爲新穀告豐而洋米又皆湧到充積之故也。其最高最低價格相差在七元以上。二十年一月至七月之米價，以十九年秋收豐足，故甚低廉，粳米各月平均價，恒盤旋在十二三元左右，四月最低祇一○·六三元。秈米平均價則突然發生反常之狀態，二三四月之價格，反較粳米爲高，此中原因，諒爲一時供求關係。八月以後，漸復常態，但長江產米各省大水爲災，人心頓慌，米亦激漲，粳米平均價驟增至十六元三角，秈米則十四元五角八分。以與七月相較，一月之間，每石漲起三元以上。十月之後，復生絕大之變化，一以國外產米各國，如安南暹羅等地，產額　富，所有餘糧，猛向國外傾銷。國内則適當九一八後，對日空氣緊張，日商曩乘我國水災嚴重，在南洋產米各國屯儲之大宗米糧忽焉貶價脫售。及後本國秋收，雖受水災，未有如想像之甚，米價乃爲之慘跌矣。故十月份粳米平均價又僅一四·○七元，秈米則爲一二·六五元，至二十一年一二八滬戰突作，延亘四月，統計材料雖告中斷，但當時米價，以大衆互相維持調節，未生變故，五六月當靑黄不接之候，粳米平均價尚在十四元左右。七月以後，以國内存糧充足，洋米充斥市塲，價格繼續下跌，大有江河日下之勢，以致造成近十年來最低之價格。計七月份爲一三·九○元，八月份爲一三·七○元，九月份爲一二·三二元，十月份爲一○·九二元，十一月份爲九·六九元，十二月份爲九·一○元，以與十九年六月之最高峯相較，復相差至二倍之數。至秈米價格之低落，仍與粳米相同。五六兩月之平均價爲一二·八三元，與一二·九九元。七月以後，亦仍一致下降，計自一一·七○元，跌至八·五七元，至本年（二十二年）入春以來，米糧價格，仍復低落，並以改用市斛之故，（較原用海斛爲小）市價更見其小也。茲將五年來粳米秈米之按日平均價格列圖於上，以資參考，表從略。</p>
<p>我國食糧生產，以年來國家多故，水旱蟲災之外，而如湘鄂皖贛等省原爲中原產米最盛之區，乃以共　用兵之故，民不得安於畎畝，於是有時反至乞濟於洋米。卽以上海而　，向來洋米進口，爲數甚微，而如十九年竟有七百餘萬担洋米輸入，則爲江浙皆歉故也。然如二十一年洋米進口，竟開未有之紀錄，數量多至二千二百四十八萬餘担，價價値乃至一萬一千九百餘萬金單位，而是年輸入上海者祇有三百九十七萬餘担，則大部分似係輪粤閩各地，粤閩何以需此大宗洋米，而長江產米之區，方告穀賤。據臆測之，其因有二，（一）閩粤等地，自聞二十年長江大水之訊，深慮本國米糧接濟不足，早向海外訂購大宗洋米，再則自有寇亂，又恐擾及海疆，閩粤旣瀕海，復皆缺糧，如果一旦封鎖，民將飢而自亂，此米糧不容不預儲也。而扼要言之，仍爲世界經濟衰落，至去年而幾超峯造極，物價低落，一般常態，亞洲產米諸邦，旣告豐收，惟一之食指繁多，又惟一之毫無關欄之國，只有我中華民國，此所以我米價愈賤，洋米不畏賤，而仍有大宗輸入，其故可長思矣。</p>
<h3>最近國際間小麥之趨勢　志德</h3>
<p>我國自農產物衰落以來，米麥進口，幾占重要之地位。惟自去年秋收尚豐，白米自無訂購之必要，而小麥則爲機製麫粉業之發展，兼之國内所產。祇敷四五個月之用，於是均以洋麥相挹注，自去年八九月至本年三四月份。訂購之數。約計一百二三十萬噸之巨。茲以國外麥市最近已有劇烈之變動，而又在在與吾國粉麥業有關，爲使業内外之明瞭起見。特根據合中公司之報告。及廠商之實際銷用。與最近之趨勢。分誌於后，事雖近乎明日黄花。要亦爲對國際貿易上。不可忽視之也。</p>
<p>查三月上半月，因値華北時局日趨緊迫，定貨方面，殊少發展。迨至下旬，始稍活躍，成交之數，約計六萬噸；計阿根庭麥四萬噸，澳麥八千噸，坎麥四千五百噸，細絲蘭麥七千五百噸。華北方面。又因洋粉須加稅。爲未雨綢繆計，對於坎拿大澳洲兩處之麫粉，尤積極暢辦，迨至四月份華南北之人心。爲之一變，因美國麥收有失望之訊，及羅斯福維持銀價之結果，遂引起世界投機者之熱烈鼓舞，致芝加哥坎拿大兩處之報價，亦與日俱增。惟華商之訂購者，則未見暢，總數祇四萬一千噸，計裝上海者，阿根庭麥三萬三千五百噸，裝靑島者，阿根庭麥四千噸，澳麥四千五百噸，良因六個月以前之定貨。已陸續到達，國内新麥。將次登場，暫無訂購之必要也。迨至五月份，以洋麥報價，步長不已。上海各廠商，一因利合不通，在國内物價衰退之際，未若以高價套賣；二因新麥已近，而訂定之貨，約計尙有二三個月之餘糧，所以洋行方面，雖有兌售，廠商則均擯守，一無問津焉。茲將世界主要麥市之趨勢，分别彚誌於次。</p>
<p>坎拿大麥之價格。其涨落之過程頗大，因匯率上之關係常不能輸入於中國。惟在美國市塲，則殊受歡迎。回憶三月下旬。因銀價有利於進口，在上海曾有少數成交，以後卽寂然無聞，蓋卽仍受匯水之束縛耳。不過就已到之貨而言。其質地多拉力。廠商搭配生產，（極受用户之歡迎）。茲將三四五月份（惠乃彼）易雜糧交所之涨落，列表於后（加幣一金元爲單位）</p>

<h3>何處安身？</h3>
<p>— 天力</p>
<p>「中國人是苦命的中國人」，這確是命裏「注定」了的，不信請放眼看，住在邊區的給敵人炸，流落在國外的便給人「驅逐」丨闊人自然除外丨</p>
<p>最近，我們在報上除看到「勦匪」捷電，川戰新聞，與華北抗日軍隊的退守「預定防線」外，値得注意的，還有旅墨華僑四千餘人，被逐回國的消息，而將來絡續回國的當有二萬餘人，這在大人先生們看來，自然是渺小不足道的一件事，反正失去了國土，還得到外國去住「别墅」，再也不會被人「驅逐」非但不驅逐，更將待爲「國賓」。</p>
<p>苦命的中國人，似乎已「注定」得很久很久，確不是現在才由三絃上彈出來的事，我們且放着國内四萬萬有零有福坐「車」而不管「車夫」將要帶你什麽地方去的「阿斗」不講，且爲那一千一百三十三萬五千個（據民國二十一年中央僑務委員會調查）現在出來的「難僑」，算一算他們究竟走了多少年數的「墓庫運，將來還有幾年好走。</p>
<p>在安土重遷的社會裏没有一點政府的援助，只爲逃避自然與人爲的迫害，遂造成了海外移民「一千萬」的偉績，不期然的挪威第二的榮稱，也落到我們頭上，然而我們這一千萬民族拓殖的英雄，實是受過很大的辛苦，經過很嚴的選擇來的，在移殖的過程中，單憑自然的搏鬥，老弱不合選的，大多是淘汰了，上得最前線的，盡屬優秀的份子，這成功的結果，是每年匯欵敷千萬元回祖國，在特殊情况之下，更有「愛國捐」，於是而中央專收華僑捐欵的機關也成立了。</p>
<p>但中國人的「苦命」終是「注定」了的，要是你没有「大英」或「花旗」的國籍，那末這「苦命」不論在國内或國外同樣　罩着你，流落在外國的，外國人的皮鞭與洋槍准有得挨，南洋華僑被西班牙人數次大屠殺，是歷史上昭著的事實，而東京地震，朝鮮暴動的二次大屠殺，在我們的記憶中尤爲新鮮，爲着世界經濟的不景氣，最後一口氣，總是出在中國人的身上，華僑的驅逐，華工的拒絕登岸，已成爲日報上常見的新聞，而我們的政府呢？對於這一班民族經濟上敗仗歸來的戰士，除了外交上的一紙公文外，餘下的就祇有一個慰電，賢明的政府，是有機會派遺專使向洋大人解釋「排外」的謠言，而無暇杭議僑民被「排」的事實。</p>
<p>現在我們在軍事還可實行退守「預定防線」，經濟上呢？已無防線可守，半殖民地的經濟肰况，是比殖民地更不景氣，所以對於這一班被迫後退的國民經濟上的先鋒部隊，在這僵化了祖國空氣中，更無活動的餘地。</p>
<h3>錄寳石戒子</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>素來没有講過中文，而到了課堂裏祇講英文的Ｘ敎師，不必去採聽，就事實上也可使我們知道他在外國住得年數太多了，所以不會說中國話呢！他的英文的確說得很流利，而且在點名的時候也都用英文來註釋全課堂同學的名字，可知他是不識中國字的，然而他的確是一個中國人。</p>
<p>平時，他在敎室裏，對待男同學雖面孔像鐵板，而對一般女同學，却總是帶着一種不敢過分笑的笑容，這也許是他的尊女輕男，别有見解和别有作用吧？又那呌得一般男同學不是氣憤不平，而對他没有好感呢！</p>
<p>眞奇怪丨某一天，他來上課的時候，怱然發現他的手上戴着一隻綠寳石的戒子；戴一隻戒子本無足奇怪，而奇怪的就在他這隻戒子，戴在左手的食指上。因此，便引起了全班男女同學的注意，在我們戀愛常識和追求學上，都知道戒子戴在食指上，是表示未婚而正在追求異性的時期，所以無謂的思考，便自然的盤繞於各人的腦海之中，也許是因爲受了好奇心的衝動，或是妬火的燃燒吧？</p>
<p>「難道他還没有妻子嗎？看他已有四十歲左右了」。</p>
<p>「他今天戴着一隻綠寳石戒在食指上，一定有意思」！</p>
<p>「我們應得注意他，去調查一個究竟」！</p>
<p>「他難道在想我們的安琪兒嗎」？</p>
<p>「看他的人也不像黄鼠狼想吃天鵝肉丨休想」！</p>
<p>因爲這綠寳石戒子的發現，這一課，他在講的話，什麽都收不進同學們的耳鼓之中，自始至終，一般的同學，視線都一致在射向他的戒子上去，有的在默默的思考，有的在交頭接耳的討論，全神都貫注在這戒子問題上。</p>
<p>當他走進了敎室的時候，第一個發現他的綠寳石戒的是一位女同學，她對於他也在懷疑而告訴别的女同學於是全體的女同學們也在注意他的戒子，似乎目的是就在爲她們而戴的。</p>
<p>這一天散課以後，男女同學，便大發議論，誰都面帶着一種忿恨的色彩，無名的妬火，在男同學的心坎上，熱烈的燃燒起來。</p>
<p>「赤老！他今天的戒子一定的意思」</p>
<p>「阿！他會來這麽一套巴戲」！</p>
<p>「我們應防備他」！</p>
<p>「在我的理智上，我們的一般女同學。决不會被他誘服的」！</p>
<p>「這也未必可加以武斷」！</p>
<p>我早就知道他不是一個好東西」！</p>
<p>「混蛋！他也在追求我們的……」！</p>
<p>以上是男同學們散課以後的議論·，這一天，一般的男同學，走到宿舍裏，誰也無心看書自修，儘自在談論這個問題。</p>
<p>同時，在女生宿舍裏，她們也在這樣的閒談着··</p>
<p>「她的戒子，自然大表示没有訂婚」</p>
<p>「據說他從小就到外國去，所以不會講中國話，也許就因在外國的緣故，理現在還没有Marry。」</p>
<p>「看他三分不像鬼，七分不像人，有誰願意隊她」！</p>
<p>「他下次上課，如果再戴這隻戒子，我是不去上課了」！</p>
<p>「他當我們什麽」！</p>
<p>「無非想……我們」！</p>
<p>「眞是豈有之理」！</p>
<p>「鬼樣的面孔，太不自量力了」！</p>
<p>這一天女生宿舍裏的談話，第二天傅到男同學的耳鼓之中，人心安定了好多，大家都在這樣的說··</p>
<p>「我們的女同學，究竟個個是見識卓越的」！</p>
<p>「誰都神聖不可侵犯的！」</p>
<p>「祇白費了這鬼的一番苦心呀！哈哈「」！</p>
<h3>人生是什麽？</h3>
<p>「人生是什麽」？這一個問題時常如旋風的在我腦中迴旋着。</p>
<p>我記得不久以前，曾經一度同朋友作過如此的討論。因爲這個朋友是剛正新近浸在戀愛的海中，所以他非常以爲人生在世全爲了戀愛。</p>
<p>「我們生在這個世界上究竟似乎是爲了什麽哪？」我問他。</p>
<p>「哈！你這個問句帶有很豐厚的哲學色彩了！」他不禁大笑起來；但是隨即他就正色的，回答我道；「我說的話，也許你要不相信；非但是你，你能夠說凡是世上没有在戀愛的圈中轉過的人都要不相信！你以爲太激烈了麽？不！我絕對的迷信「愛情如聖藥」這一句話。什麽事業？什麽創造？這都是欺人之談，你以爲對麽？就譬如人生是一個軀壳，愛情便是靈魂；没有了靈魂，何論何種徫大的事業也無心去經營了。所以我說人生在世，全是爲了戀愛！」</p>
<p>「那麽，待至你有目夢醒的時候，或者也要失笑今日的思想了。」</p>
<p>於是我們不再談這個問題。</p>
<p>又有一次。我記得和其他的一個朋友，也提起了這個飄渺難答的問題。然而結果却易愛情爲「金錢」；其原因是迷信於「金錢萬能」四個字。當然，這並不能使我滿意；可是。除了這兩種回答以外，再也没有人告訴我第三種的新答案了。因此，我仍是終日盲目的生存在世上。</p>
<p>然而我相信，我並且十二分地相信；人生决不是祇追求到金錢以及戀愛便可算了。在未來的光陰，將帶着一種含有絕大的安慰力的事情降生到地球上來，牠的力量，能打破一打無聊的生活，能創設無限的光明！這時候，槍砲已經廢止了，世界已經大同了，萬民安業，無嚷無爭，但是不知道我們可有福氣</p>
<p>這不過是我的夢想！「人生是什麽」這個問題仍舊如旋風般的終日在我腦中迴旋個無休無息！</p>

<h3>店員通訊</h3>
<p>爲虎作倀</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是本埠南京路某大糖果公司的一個小職員，現在要求先生解答下面的問題。</p>
<p>今天本公司經幾個大享（主任）的密議，要爲他們所說的勞苦功高的總經理建造住宅。其經費，則利用他們的權威，强迫由本公司之總店本外埠各支店及工廠之職員與工友擔負之。每人每月抽薪金十分之一，五月爲期。先生丨你聽了這個消息，作如何感想？</p>
<p>可憐我們勞動者，已將整個的身心，商品一樣的賣去事；所得到的，一些僅堪維持生命的工錢。現在傷心病狂，不顧人家死活的所謂大亨，還要忍心想出方法來掠奪。先生丨怎樣對付呢！</p>
<p>一個人的奮鬥，是没有力量的，所以想聯合起來，站在一條戰線上反抗。可是平時無組織，聚然起來應付這已經發生的這件事，倒是不容易。先生！屈服呢？抵抗呢？我在徬徨着！</p>
<p>在這種情形下，我想一方面向主任陳述不能負擔的原因；一方面向總理詳述此舉之利害，並要求設法制止；但是他們又狼狽爲奸。先生！你有辦法嗎？我很盼望着一個覆音。此頌撰安丨徐上達謹上。</p>
<p>編者按“讀了徐君的來信，使人不得不痛恨於一般爲虎作倀的資本家的走狗。在許多塲合裏，我們每每可以看到資本家的自身，雖則其心不可問，但是面子上邊，終還有些顧忌，不敢一意的膽大妄爲。惟有這般走狗，他們因爲要完成他們升格爲資本家的夢想的緣故，一味把結資本家；一方面利用他的權威，來剝削勞動者；一方面向資本家暗送秋波。結果，勞動者固眞是首當其衝任其宰割；但是資本家呢，弄得不好，造成極大風波，爲小失大，像狗吃了猪油包竹弓似的，有話難分，所以這種敗類，簡直是社會之蠧，也簡直是勞資糾紛的導火線，恨我没有權力，否則定要將他們一個送上斷頭臺去。親愛的勞動者呀丨在你們奮鬥的進程中，他們才是你們第一個對象；這般人存在一天，你們就不要想過一天好日子了。賢明的資本家呀丨你不要以爲他們是你們的忠僕，他們的動機，完全爲了他們自已；一旦弄出事來，他們是可以不負責任的呀丨快明察他们的奸計，快把他們驅逐。那末在生產落後的中國，儘有你們的地位，否則，怕就要做衆矢之的。</p>
<p>所以徐君想向經理申訴，我們是很贊成；惟有你想向主任陳述一節，我們以爲大可不必，與虎謀皮，無益有害，起來，向這般對象，一致進攻。</p>

<h3>五姬的一生　（二十一）（續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鴻</p>
<p>十八·秋</p>
<p>日子過得眞快，一轉眼又是秋凉。</p>
<p>我們的柳娘究竟也是一個善感的詩人，她倚在窗前凝望着隔牆伸出快要焦黄的銀杏，靜聽着秋風掠過樹梢頭，不由的身上也感受着冰人的凉意，假如再加上冷雨絲絲，那末少不了在她的靈感中畫出一幅凄凉的圖畫。於是她鼻子裏便不期而然的哼出「秋風秋雨愁煞人」的詩句。於此可知，柳姑娘在最近幾年果然增加了學問不少。</p>
<p>蘇耕雲部長近來興緻眞好，今天又在她身邊糾纏了老半天。現在看見柳姑站在窗前出神，少不了躡手躡脚的走近她的背後，將雙手架在她的肩上低聲的說··</p>
<p>「你爲什麽一聲不響的站在這裏，是不是又想起什麽心事來了？」</p>
<p>「想心事？别笑話了罷。我又不是什麽達官貴人，我又用不着擔心國家大事，我有什麽心事可想呢？」</p>
<p>「又來挖苦我了，你這個刁嘴。可是你得知道國家大事和小姑娘的心事並不一樣，而且國家大事本來也就用不着你們關心。可是姑娘們的心事總是很重的，對景懷人，吟風弄月，自然是女兒們份内的風流韻事。可不知道你現在所想的是那一個人兒？」</p>
<p>因爲他這樣的一提，馬上在心頭泛起張文彬的英姿，於是少不了嘴角一歪的說··</p>
<p>「那還消問嗎？當然是想着你囉。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你丨可是不見得眞有如此好心腸，恐怕這時候正想着那位大塊頭顧」</p>
<p>守道吧？」</p>
<p>「呸！你說得好意思嗎？」</p>
<p>「話雖如此說，可是我總覺得有一點不放心。喂，我跟你說句正經話，你正式嫁給我好嗎？」</p>
<p>「嫁給你？」柳姑娘眞有一點覺得好笑了。「你眞的這樣說嗎？可是你不是連大夫人一共有四個了嗎？難道還不夠嗎？」</p>
<p>「那不能這樣說的。我告訴你；譬如我的那位太太，你是知道的，年紀已」</p>
<p>經老了，除了打幾張牌以外，什麽事也不能幹，一個女人老了的確是没有什麽了不起的。第二個是日本人，來往的信札，多要她親自動手，一天到晚忙得很，所以談不上什麽閨房之樂。第三個哩，老實說：小家出身，只能陪着睡睡了事。第四個更不消說，年紀太輕，什麽也不懂，有時候還背着我在哭母親哩，眞是可笑極了。並且我那兩個女兒，現在都長大了，她的母親又放心不下，不肯給她進女學校贖書，直到現在仍然是很少敎養，更不懂得交際，少不了將來在社會上都是站脚不住的。所以我常是這樣想；假如你能夠到我家裏來，那便再好没有了，小女能有人敎養固不說，就是我老頭子一天到晚能夠陪着你坐在一塊兒談談笑笑，那眞是再快樂没有的。</p>
<p>「好一個風騷的老頭兒，想不到還有這麽好的興緻。」柳姑娘忍不住大笑起來了；「可是你準知道我就非嫁你不可嗎？」</p>
<p>「那怎麽好這樣說呢？假使你肯多痛我一些的話，那我想………」</p>
<p>柳姑娘又是一陳大笑。不久，秋天的暮色又偷偷的捲了上來。</p>

<h3>從「春江花月夜」的歌曲說到新興音樂（上）</h3>
<p>— 任西逹</p>
<p>「春江花月夜」（Tell　me　tonight）裏面的曲子，大部分是把意大利的兩個各歌劇Boheme　（Ｐuccini作·I853I924）和Ｒigoleto　（Vendi　作，I８I３I９０I）裏面的重要部分，採取出來，在表演的形式上使她電影化，而不是把整個的舞台歌劇搬上銀幕。</p>
<p>但是爲甚麽在這一千九百三十年後的現在，反而會把一千八百幾十年的歌曲格了起來呢？這我們最好是先把近十年來音樂發展情形說一下。</p>
<p>雖然在歐戰前「爵士」音樂，已經由黑人流入了所謂文明的美國，經過了這所謂文明的美國，把這種原始音樂給她工業化起來，於是便由歐美國固有的跳舞曲子One　siep進爲現在的Foxtrot了。但因歐戰的發生，社會人們都在水深火熱中過生活，所以這種跳無曲子便没有機會盛行，歐戰後，美國工業漸次發展，「爵士」也便隋着工業的發展而發展起來。一九二四後，歐洲的經濟也漸次呈現繁榮，「爵士」的勢利，也就因此深入了歐洲。</p>
<p>每個時代，必有每個時代的藝術，工業時代，必然的會產生讚美和誇張機器力量的音樂。「爵士」正是產生在這個時代，因此「爵士」音樂的特性。就是她「有組織」而比較「大衆化」。後來因爲資本主義的更深發展，所以這時「爵士」音樂的形式，也便由“Foxtrot”進而產一了Samba”，她的特點是完全描寫火車動作的音響。不過這種單純的機械音嚮，在音樂形式上，說起來終於是太簡單了。不足以表現資本主義的繁榮。於是“Charleston”“BlackBattom”……種種形式，相繼而產生。這種調子的野心，是想把全宇宙的事物，動物以及人類的動作，都給她加以「機器化」，表示機器力量的偉大！所以當這時候的「爵士」音樂，眞是進入了瘋狂狀態中，整個歐美社會，都被這種資產階級音樂所麻醉，特别是小資產階級，更被她麻醉得厲害。很多學音樂的人們和製曲家都把「爵士」當作職業，自然而然的「爵士」就被「商業化」而失掉藝術價値。同時「爵士」旣是深入了小資產階級，於是漸漸的大部分的「爵士」也就又「小資產階級化」了。不過雖則這樣·但「爵士」的資產階級音樂性的特點，仍然是堅强的存在着。一直到一九二六年爲止，這種資產階級的「爵士」音樂。稱爲全盛開花時期。</p>
<p>從一九二七到一九二八。機器雖然還是極力的在發展，不過資本家在工業方面，經濟上却呈露着嚴重的危機，地位漸漸搖動。那麽這種代表資本主義「開花時代」的音樂，當然是不能合於現社會的時代性了。於是這種没落，悲哀的，“Blues”和消極，感傷的“Tango”調子，就應時而漸漸發展，恰恰能適合了時代的情感而深入於社會一搬人的心理中。在「爵士」音樂發展的過程上，佔了相當地位。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「歌女情深」</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>走出了南京大戲院，浮上我腦海的就是「歌女情深」Broadway　Bad裏導演的技巧。的確，這一張影片在意義和演出方面，都是毫無趣味可言。只有精美超越的藝術，是値得我們回味的。</p>
<p>這一張片子的本事，是很簡單··牠說一個歌女將要和一個富家子去結婚了，不料因一時的誤會，忽然與他反目，她就和歌舞團裏的一個董事戀愛了。後來富家子把歌女所生的一個四歲的孩子奪爲已有，並且控之法庭。經歌女極力辯白，此子不是富家子所生，法庭的判决，仍以孩子歸於歌女，此案遂結束，而劇本也莫明其妙的結束了。</p>
<p>片名呌「情深」，然而内容並没有愛情，只有肉慾，只有母子天性之愛，歌女的極力剖白一切，只是爲了她的兒子，對於舊戀丨丨富家子丨丨却絲毫無動於中。同時，影片裏對於富家子和歌舞團董事，兩個男主角的個性一切，也都絲毫没有表述到。當然，他們的一切動作，在第三者看來，也　得是突然的，富家子在先怎麽和歌女戀愛的？董事以金錢作求愛的進階，他們兩個人的品行人格，都呌人懷疑到了極點。瓊勃郎黛爾Joan　Btondell飾那個歌女，是非常好的，特别是未尾，她的含淚，苦笑，更呌人有不能忘去的印象，其餘如驚喜交集，忿恨假笑等等，也極有動人的力量。全片只有她作了一個中心，其餘角色都平淡無奇，男主角利卡杜考爾色Ricardo　Cortez往常是很會作戲的一　個演員，但是這裏不知怎的那樣呆板，只可以稱爲「木的美男子」了。</p>
<p>佈景很别緻，同時利用鏡頭的角度，更覺得非常美感。光線也很不錯，近攝，（特寫）平攝，遠攝，各有其妙，許多傍借的特寫，更極幽默之能事。幕前的說明，聰明可取。</p>
<p>導演是本片的唯一功臣，他知道怎樣去取巧，去博觀衆的歡笑，雖然不少地方是避難趨易，是偷懶，但是並不討厭，反覺曲折可喜，小穿插更是他得意的長處，例如描寫一雙情人親暱的形狀，借一張風吹的紙片來形容，又如富家子面目的可怖，用門上銅環人頭去對照，這都是使觀衆神往的地方。組織是特意的使牠散漫，然後由一團亂絲裏，找出一個頭緒，不禁拍案呌絕。</p>
<p>如果你是愛好藝術的，那末這張片子，是頗合你需要的，特别是電影從業員，更應當去一看的。</p>
<h3>評「仁愛」Humanity</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>假使我們不否認美國影片演出技巧的純熟，（雖然這種技巧祇適合他們自已的意識形態）那末，「仁愛」的演出又是値得他們誇耀的了。</p>
<p>導演對於老的Montage　很有深刻的考慮，所以在情調上說，的確是從毛醫生救治那個陷於危險狀態中的女孩起，一直到Ead都是非常緊凑的。當然，這大半部正是劇的重心，而前小半不過是必須的配襯，所以導演只用簡短的鏡頭叙述出來，但是也並不見過於鬆懈。可是在後面那種靜美的畫面，緊張的空氣，眞是導演十分努力的結果。其最能使我們注意的便是當急診女孩的時候。另加兩個小孩和狗在一旁凝視，使這個緊張的畫面能夠生動起來，由此可知導演的用心之苦。他如對於一切小場合都很注意，例如在貧人的病塌前以報紙障住燈光。甚至於他對於照明和佈景等都很考究。總之，導演是很成功的。</p>
<p>關於表演，自然那毛醫生父子都各有成績。飾父親的賴爾甫毛根，對於「仁愛」的個性確是充分的把握住了，忠厚長者的眞情，流露於一舉一動之間。然而總嫌面部表情不夠，例如當偵探駕臨的時候，他祇能在音調上表現出緊張的心情。至於兩個女角，都屬平平，比較上那個飾醫生助手的不見純熟。</p>
<p>然而本片有一個顯著的缺點，那便是老醫生死得太快而奇突。這是導演和編劇者的毛病，嚴格的說便是不通。然而我們對於這種影片，也不必存着過大的奢望吧。</p>
<p>至於說到意義，那末這種影片對於現實社會是很投機的。一個好的醫生必定要以菩蕯心腸去體念貧窮而又患着疾病的人們，這樣便算是忠實於自已的職業。至於法律當然更得遵守，所以靑年醫生便在罪大惡極之後而懺悔過來。因爲如此，於是大公無私的法律也就可以不咎旣往了。如此而已。</p>

<p>好萊塢的電影明星們，因爲近來好萊塢盜賊日衆，爲避免意外起見，一切財產都存於銀行要用臨時簽支票去拿，因此有一天却請他們享受享受窮小子的生活了。</p>
<p>這一天美國銀行逢到特别休業日，全國的銀行都關了門，好萊塢的銀行也照樣休假一天，早上好萊塢的報紙送到明星們的家裏，報紙上的大標題寫着今日銀行休業，幾位袋底空空如也的明星，無不呌苦，這一天的好萊塢，就變成了窮世界，許多明星都蹙起眉頭來。</p>
<p>亞爾喬爾生恰巧袋袋裏一個錢也没有，馬上向有錢的朋友告貸，賈克歐凱這一天也是急得一佛出世，險些早餐也吃不起。希佛萊恰巧汽車中汽油用光，向僕人借了二塊錢買汽油。史都歐文借不到錢，回到家裏去把孩子的儲蓄盒子偷了出來。潘格霍金絲坐了汽車出來，身邊一個角子都没有，後來跑到派拉蒙公司，派拉蒙的一位司閽恰巧早一天支到薪金，還剩了幾元現金，就借給了她。金格羅吉士連六角九分的債務都付不出。麗琳搭熙門的錢袋之中，一起倒出來祇有一角三分大洋。羅蘭特陽去吃飯，没有錢，幸虧同飯店素來熟識，就寫了賬，吃了一天欠債的飯。妲娓曼納的錢袋中也只剩了二角七分錢。新到好萊塢的英國明星娓拉安姬，她不知道這一天美國銀行要休假的，没有預先拿錢，所以也是兩手空空。還有佐靈克利，愛琳鄧，加利葛富等吃飯是包在飯店中的，不必付現錢，但小帳是要的，這天他們都寫了借據I.O.M，给堂倌們。</p>
<h3>浙江大戲院之航空舞</h3>
<p>浙江大戲院，於開映裴司開登「攝影大王」一片之餘，禮聘全班舞女，表演各種新式舞蹈，並爲提倡航空救國起見，特加入「航空舞」一節，表演時飛機上下，國旗飄揚，大書「航空救國」字樣，旣當時令，復能促進中華人士之愛國思想。</p>
<h3>蘇俄電影概况（二）</h3>
<p>— 魯道夫梅蘇氏著抱寒譯</p>
<p>電影之在俄國，人俱視爲思想敎育上無所不備的大計劃中最重要之一部份。所謂思想敎育者，即共產主義哲學以内之敎育是也。蘇維埃人已覺悟到電影在敎育上之大勢力。故無論在少女口上，或在民衆議會之中，每論及電影二字。俱有堂皇莊重之宣示。彼等蘇維埃女子或議員所覺悟到者，與吾國少女或議員所亦已覺悟到者，初無二致；所可異者彼蘇維埃人已採取嚴厲之步驟以保持潛藏在電影以内之敎育勢力，不爲他物所掩蓋，此則吾國下院内外人等所未遑計及者也。</p>
<p>在蘇聯境内，所謂敎育者，當然與宣傅二字爲極近同義之事物。事實旣如此，則吾人察得蘇俄電影攝製場之出品以及電影院内所放映之影片，除却宣傅影片之外，别無他物時，亦不足驚異矣。（國外影片之輪入者，後當别論之）</p>
<p>吾等歐人生活之慣常，每喜走入富麗煇煌之戲院中，在黯澹銀光之下·尋一娛樂弛放之趣，故驟遇此等嚴酷之態度，每易爲之橋舌驚駭。試想旣無勞萊與哈第，亦無一尺之西方蠻荒，不見特斯脫利之馳騁於沙礫之中，且并嘉寳亦不見其踪跡，此復成何景象？僅是宣傅品，宣傅品復有宣傅品，究復有何意味？歐人之入蘇俄者，將徬徨詢問，「吾將何往而尋求些小輕鬆之娛樂？」俄人聞此，必能不假思索而告汝··「馬戲場中！跳舞場中！敎育游息之公園中丨無論何處，汝但往尋求之可耳。若欲於電影院中尋求娛樂，是直妄想也。」</p>
<p>蓋在蘇俄人之心目中，電影之宣傅力實至重要絕不容其低降没落，或消沈其實力於空妄無謂之娛樂一途。且俄人亦或將問汝：「吾人之宣傳影片，果眞毫無娛樂之價値乎？」實則最佳之片如「金山」（Tee　Gelden　Mountains）亦頗有娛樂之可尋；其次佳者如「黑膚」（The　Black　Black　Skin），已不可必；再降而至於三等片如　The　Guiet　Don等，則絕無丨（未完）</p>

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong returned to Nanjing from Beiping by special train at 11:30 pm on the 28th, accompanied by only three staff members. Huang said that his mission to the south was due to the recent armistice in North China, which has caused widespread doubts. He is returning to Nanjing to report to the central government on the armistice process and the truth to dispel public doubts. As for this armistice, it is only a preliminary temporary ceasefire agreed upon verbally, and no agreement has been signed. Currently, the troops on both sides have withdrawn from each other and are at a greater distance. The war has completely stopped. Further negotiations in the future are the responsibility of the central government. The current ceasefire is only the beginning of peace. He has heard of Feng Yuxiang assuming the position of Commander-in-Chief of the National Anti-Japanese Salvation Army in Beiping, but the military authorities in North China seem to believe that this kind of action is a patriotic act and there is no need to express any opinion. As for the future of the situation in North China, it depends on whether the Japanese have any remorse. It is difficult to say at this moment whether there will be war or peace in the future.

Gunfire erupted for a time, order was disrupted, and looting was rampant. A certain railway driver and his family of five were robbed, and three of them were killed.

<h3>Jin Shuren Arrives at Vladivostok</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) The Qinghai Party, Government, and Military Joint Association believes that the Qinghai-Tibet peace negotiations are about to be resolved, but the Xinjiang incident has occurred, which affects the entire border defense and may hinder progress. Therefore, it has sent a representative, Ma Tengyun, to Nanjing to ask the central government to take appropriate measures to deal with the Xinjiang incident as soon as possible. In recent days, he has visited Zhu Peide, He Yaozu, and Musong to explain everything in detail and ask them to adopt his suggestions. According to Ma, the Dalai Lama's invasion of Tibet and Qinghai is part of an overall plan. Since the central government ordered Commander Ma of the New 9th Division to cease operations in Yushu last year and negotiate peaceful solutions with the Dalai Lama, the Dalai Lama has superficially pretended to cooperate while actively arranging military affairs. Before leaving Qinghai, I received reliable information that the Dalai Lama recently transported about 140 camel carts of military supplies from India to Yugan. A war is imminent.

<h3>Representatives from Various Countries Mostly Advocate</h3>
<p>Complete Abolition of Aerial Bombardment</p>
<p>Britain and Germany Insist on Stipulating Exceptions</p>
<p>Gu Weijun Painfully Speaks of the Tragic State of Japanese Bombardment</p>
<p>(Geneva) Britain proposed today at the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference a reservation for the use of aircraft for policing. Representatives from various countries protested. At the beginning of the meeting, British representative Eden first gave a speech, speaking about the use of bombers for policing purposes in the colonies, saying that in mountainous and sparsely populated areas, the air force is superior to the army in policing work. The section in the British plan regarding the retention of bombers for policing purposes must not be cancelled. Representatives from the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, and Sweden strongly opposed this view, but Eden claimed that the areas where Britain intends to use aircraft are mountainous and sparsely populated areas. If troops are stationed there, it would be very dangerous and would inevitably lead to significant loss of life, but with aircraft, a single warning would be sufficient to restore peace. Britain cannot abandon this proposal, and he might as well frankly explain this position to the General Commission. US representative Wilson said that the United States advocates the complete abolition of aerial bombardment. This abolition must be absolute, unconditional, and universal. Aerial bombardment is not morally permissible and must be subject to moral sanctions. Any exception will undermine the power of moral sanctions. Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun proposed that, for the sake of humanitarian interests, the British reservation should be deleted. He said that the creation of great empires has never relied on bombers, and aerial bombardment should be completely abolished. If there are exceptions, then all countries will maintain bombers. With bombers, it is inevitable that they will be used. China has particularly good reason to be apprehensive about this. In the past twenty months, hundreds of foreign bombers have penetrated deep into the interior of China, dropping thousands of fierce bombs, killing tens of thousands of innocent men, women, children, and the elderly. Prosperous cities, if not completely destroyed, have also suffered significant damage. Eden replied, still not changing his position, saying that if bombers are not allowed to be used for policing purposes, then it will be necessary to retain many soldiers, and the number of deaths and injuries will increase. If the General Commission accepts the British figures, then the air forces of all countries can be reduced by 50 percent. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Issue of Prohibiting Aerial Bombardment</h3>
<p>Informal Contact between Britain and America</p>
<p>Optimistic Signs for the Future of Disarmament</p>
<p>(Geneva) British and American disarmament representatives held private consultations today in an attempt to eliminate differences of opinion on the issue of prohibiting aerial bombardment. This is the only point on which the two countries have significant differences of opinion regarding the MacDonald disarmament plan. Although Britain and the United States recognize that aerial warfare should be prohibited, British representative Eden believes that aerial bombardment can sometimes reduce casualties. Therefore, in certain remote areas of the world, where there is a need for armed suppression, it should be placed outside the prohibition, such as some well-armed mountain tribes in mandate territories who often rely on the dangers of the mountains and frequently harass the residents of isolated villages. It is not easy to achieve quick results without using aircraft for suppression. If ordinary ground troops are used, the cost would be huge and the loss of life would be great. US representative Wilson, on the other hand, opposes the use of bombing aircraft for policing purposes and insists on complete prohibition, saying that the United States believes that aerial bombardment, regardless of the circumstances, is a criminal act. He urged the British representative to withdraw the provision in the disarmament proposal that allows the use of aerial bombardment for policing purposes. With the two sides firmly divided, representatives from various countries have their own allegiances. Most countries with mandate territories where natives often revolt support the British position, while most others support the American position, with China, Germany, and Soviet Russia particularly strongly supporting it. However, it is expected that this point of contention will not be difficult to negotiate a compromise solution. The general impression is that although there will be many disputes in the General Commission regarding the disarmament treaty in the future, a satisfactory agreement can always be reached, but it will take time. Today, US representative Wilson telegraphed the US State Department, saying that if the disarmament treaty cannot be signed soon, he believes that the disarmament conference should continue to be held after the opening of the economic conference. The US Secretary of State immediately replied that the US government believes that discussions should continue until an agreement is reached. There has been a suggestion at the meeting to continue the meeting during the London Economic Conference, so the US representative made this request for instructions. Also, today, French Foreign Minister Peng Gu declared that if there is a satisfactory and permanent way to supervise civil aircraft, France will abandon the demand for international management and accept quantitative and qualitative reductions in military aircraft. His words also added to the optimism about the future of disarmament. (27th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Ambition of Japanese Militarism</h3>
<p>(New York) The New York Times published an editorial commenting on the progress of the Far East incident and Japan's efforts to expand its navy, stating, "Japan's new ambitions may cause the United States to change its attitude towards the disarmament issue." Its conclusion stated, "Japan wants to dominate the Far East and wants to make its naval power equal to that of any country. This shows that Japan's political ambitions and naval ambitions are closely related. This situation may create a situation that does not allow the United States to return to its isolationist policy, and when the London Naval Treaty of 1935 is re-discussed, we must not want Japan and the United States to fall into isolation."

<h3>Disarmament Faces Another Difficult Hurdle</h3>
<p>Security Issues Discussed Today</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference is scheduled to address the issue of security tomorrow. It will encounter one of the most difficult issues in the entire plan, namely Article 6, which is related to the Mutual Assistance Pact. The attitudes of Germany and Italy during the General Commission's discussions do not give people hope that this issue will be easily resolved. Therefore, it is expected that tomorrow's discussions will reveal the great divergence of opinions among European countries. A certain newspaper here published a rumor that the World Economic Conference may be moved to Geneva half a month after its opening in London, because it is difficult for the League of Nations Secretariat to handle two major conferences at the same time. The Disarmament Conference was originally scheduled to close on June 10. If there is no long-term recess by then, there is no alternative but to move the Economic Conference to Geneva. US representative Davis now advocates that the recess of the Disarmament Conference should not exceed two weeks, while the League of Nations favors holding the two major conferences in Geneva at the same time. However, some people also advocate that the Disarmament Conference should be adjourned until the fall. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>"Britain Is an Aggressor"</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Criticizes British Foreign Policy</p>
<p>(Moscow) The "Pravda" newspaper here published an article today commenting on the speech by British representative Eden at the Disarmament Conference against the Soviet proposal defining an aggressor, saying that Britain itself is an aggressor, and its entire foreign policy is based on the principle of aggression. Therefore, it does not want the Soviet proposal passed by the Security Committee to restrict the freedom of action of its diplomatic, military, and espionage agencies. Eden's opposition to the Soviet proposal, saying that it is too "strict," shows that warmongers do not want their freedom of action in other countries to be restricted in the slightest. The British representative wants the definition to have a "flexible form," but the entire purpose of the Soviet proposal is to remove this flexibility in order to prevent imperialists from using "self-defense and protection of interests" as excuses to carry out plundering. Eden must know that those powers, especially one of them, have recently used the "flexibility" he demanded to cover up their actions. Therefore, his speech, representing the opinions of diehards and interventionists, is tantamount to announcing their intention to invade other countries. The newspaper's conclusion stated that, clearly, the arrow shot by the Soviet representative at those aggressors has hit its mark. This is fortunate for peace, but also unfortunate for British imperialism. (27th TASS Dispatch)</p>

Dai is inspecting the site of an agricultural and forestry school, which will be established in Wugong, and will also go to Luoyang for a tour. Lin's train left Luoyang on the morning of the 27th, did not stop along the way, and will arrive in Nanjing tonight.

<h3>The United States Has the Impression of Allowing Self-Resolution on the Far East Issue</h3>
<p>Roosevelt and Ishii Issue Joint Communiqué</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources today, when the US President and Japanese Envoy Ishii discussed economic and disarmament issues, it was felt that it was difficult to completely avoid discussing the military situation in the Far East. However, there was only a brief discussion of the Manchurian issue, and the US President did not clearly state the US attitude to Ishii, which seemed to give the impression of allowing sufficient time for self-resolution. It is also expected that the US government will not issue a statement changing its attitude in the near future. As the official circles here admitted that Japan had requested to discuss a new naval agreement in Geneva, there was some tension in Washington, but the White House's statement has eased some of it. It is said that although the results of the talks may not lead to substantial changes in the disarmament attitudes of the two countries, as far as Ishii's situation is concerned, it has dispelled many of Japan's doubts.</p>
<p>There is currently a feeling in the US official circles that if Japan does not make a clear statement on its policy towards China, the World Economic Conference will be greatly hindered. However, there are also those who believe that such a statement will be made after the conference is convened. According to reports, the talks between the US President and Ishii were the last discussions with representatives of major financial countries. At present, Japan has not made any indication of its attitude towards reducing its tariffs, but it has also been said that representatives from other countries have not made any special statements on this matter either. It is expected that it will be announced at the London conference. Ishii is currently scheduled to go to New York on Sunday to meet with banking and finance experts there, and then he will leave for London. (27th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt and Ishii, the Japanese representative to the World Economic Conference, held their final meeting, they issued a joint statement today, stating, "We agree that economic stability and political tranquility are the two fundamental requirements for peace. To achieve this goal, economic and military cooperation is necessary. We hope that the countries of the Far East and the East can make important contributions in a spirit of cooperation to lay a solid foundation for world peace and prosperity. We now fully agree that, in order to avoid the current financial turmoil, international efforts should be made to establish an orderly system, and that unreasonable obstacles to trade and capital flows should be removed, and that exchange rates should be adequately protected. We also believe that the price of silver should be appropriately raised, and the exchange of silver should be stabilized. The World Economic Conference and the Disarmament Conference will contribute our utmost abilities with the utmost cooperation. Therefore, we have high hopes for the convening of the World Economic Conference and the success of the Disarmament Conference." When Ishii spoke with President Roosevelt, the Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Debuchi, and the Vice President of the Bank of Japan, Fukai, were also present. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Had America Ever Abandoned Neutrality?</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a bill authorizing the President to declare an embargo on arms exports. The bill had previously passed in the House, but the Foreign Relations Committee added an amendment stipulating that when declaring an arms embargo, it must be simultaneously declared against all belligerent nations to demonstrate American neutrality. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) A bill authorizing the President to declare an embargo on arms exports to any country engaged in conflict or facing a significant threat of war, has been favorably reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today after review. However, it includes Johnson's proposed amendment, requiring that arms embargoes be applied to all countries surrounding a war zone. This is because during the European War, neutral countries often purchased arms and then transferred them to belligerent nations. Therefore, embargoes have been applied to both neutral and belligerent countries. Johnson claims that this amendment can preserve America's traditional neutrality policy and reserves the right to determine the aggressor to Congress. He said that singling out a country for an arms embargo is tantamount to declaring that country an aggressor, which could lead to war. According to the Constitution, only the President and Congress have the power to declare war. (Guomin News Agency, 27th)</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary</h3>
<p>What is the Truth About the Ceasefire Negotiations in North China? - Zi</p>
<p>Analyzing important current events, so that readers can gain a more accurate understanding of them, in order to curb rampant rumors - this is one of the main missions of newspaper commentary. However, the analysis of events relies on appropriate information. The term "appropriate" includes conditions such as not violating the truth and having reliable sources. Therefore, when a major event occurs in a country, it is necessary for the authorities to provide news reporters with the convenience of gathering news and transmitting information.</p>
<p>The ceasefire negotiations in North China, after a period of serious setbacks, on the morning of the 23rd, the two sides were able to approach each other. For the past week, the progress seemed to be quite smooth. According to foreign dispatches, the first step has already come to an end. However, at this time, because the domestic news media cannot obtain the convenience of gathering and publishing news, there is no way to contribute information that clarifies the truth and benefits understanding to society, let alone base analysis on true events. This allows the opposing side to take the opportunity to implement news policies and spread all kinds of incorrect information. At the same time, the public is unable to fully understand the truth of the negotiations, leading to all kinds of strange rumors and speculations. Under these circumstances, strong individuals are stimulated and indignant, while weak individuals are dispirited by disappointment. If this situation cannot be changed, the impact will be very worrying. The authorities have already announced to the nation the policy of "resisting while negotiating" to deal with the national crisis. Now that negotiations are underway after resistance, it is even more important to disclose all information about the negotiations without concealment, so that the people can understand and seek their sympathy, and not allow themselves to be misled by the opposing side's propaganda and popular rumors, and fall into a state of indignation and discouragement.</p>
<p>That a ceasefire has been reached between the two sides and that the Chinese and Japanese troops are gradually withdrawing backwards - this is an obvious fact. Under this obvious fact, the key points of the understanding between the two sides and the limits of the troop withdrawal are what the people want to know. Since the initial negotiations, Japanese news agencies and newspapers have been spreading rumors that are sufficient to stimulate the Chinese people's psychology, saying what the conditions of understanding are and to which area and location the Chinese army should withdraw. We regard this kind of malicious propaganda news from the opposing side as having very little credible value and do not want to repeat it. It should be noted that all the rumors that have spread in society have originated from the Japanese side's publicity. Now, if we want to effectively prove that the news spread by the Japanese is contrary to the truth and eradicate popular rumors, the fundamental method is to provide the Chinese news media with the convenience of gathering and transmitting news, without the slightest concealment, so that they can reveal the truth and make appropriate analysis.</p>
<p>When a country wants to resolve major events, the sympathy and understanding of the people are necessary conditions. If these conditions cannot be met, things that are beneficial to the country cannot obtain the assistance of the whole country and are difficult to achieve. Responsible authorities, no matter how hard they work, people will not know, and they will inevitably face obstacles. Those who are handling the ceasefire negotiations today must also be deeply aware of this principle. And to seek the sympathy and understanding of the people, open diplomacy is the most appropriate method.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a friend who studied in Germany wrote in a letter praising the German authorities' ingenious method of resolving the anti-Yang Plan tide among the German people after accepting the Young Plan. The method was to use newspapers to convey to the German people the truth about the negotiation process and the difficulties faced by the authorities, and ultimately to seek the people's sympathy and understanding. The tide of opposition soon subsided. We hope that those who are handling the ceasefire negotiations today will use this method that has been proven effective by the German authorities.</p>
<h3>After the US Officially Abolished the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Commodity and Securities Market Prices Skyrocket</p>
<p>Financial Circles Talk Extensively About Inflation</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the Banking and Currency Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed Steagall's proposal to formally declare the abolition of the gold standard in the United States. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(New York) The news that the government intends to legislate to abolish the gold standard has sparked a frenzy of skyrocketing commodity and securities market prices. This morning, there were extremely many transactions, and prices surged, which has not been seen for a long time. Important stocks rose by one to six dollars in record-breaking trading, while the dollar depreciated sharply when measured in foreign currencies. The operating tools of the stock exchange were struggling to cope. In the two hours of business on Saturday morning, 4.3 million shares were traded. Many lots involved 5,000 to 25,000 shares. This new mania is clearly a direct result of the government's proposal to abolish the gold clause in public and private contracts. However, some claim that the government's move is just a step to legalize the existing situation. Government bonds are easing, but secondary bonds are very active. Foreign bonds are firm. The bill to abolish the gold standard and the announcement of the Federal Reserve's credit expansion program (i.e., purchasing government bonds in the open market) made Wall Street very busy this morning. Financial circles are full of talk about inflation. There is much discussion about the possibility of establishing an open gold market in New York, imitating London's method. Gold mining companies are naturally welcome, as they can obtain the true value of their gold. Under the current system, gold mining companies must sell their gold at the statutory price of $20.67 per ounce to the Treasury. Gold cannot be freely exported. The mine owners are bound by this method and cannot obtain the gold surplus resulting from the devaluation of the dollar. Although the United Kingdom has abandoned the gold standard, London has a free gold market where the highest selling price can be obtained. Therefore, the value of gold coming in and out of the London gold market every week is in the millions of pounds, as the United Kingdom currently has no restrictions on gold exports. Commodity market prices also rose today, especially in the wheat market. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) German officials are paying close attention to the news that the United States has legislated to abolish the gold standard. A spokesman for the German National Bank today discussed the impact of this move on Germany and the question of whether Germany can maintain the gold standard. He said that he was unable to comment on this situation related to Germany, but if the dollar were to be significantly devalued, the important question of whether Germany could maintain the gold standard would arise.

<h3>The Old Dragon Boat Festival Adorns the New Capital</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today is the old Dragon Boat Festival amidst national crises. Many citizens of Nanjing are still planting calamus and mugwort everywhere. Businesses are settling accounts, but due to the depressed market, there are no accounts to settle. Government personnel, because the Ministry of Finance issued salaries half a month in advance, the custom of giving gifts cannot be avoided. Entertainment venues are three times as profitable. There are many visitors to the Mausoleum Park. The government agencies that have advanced salaries include the Executive Yuan, Examination Yuan, and Control Yuan, which are allowed to advance a certain amount in the name of loans. The Judicial Yuan issued 80%, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Finance issued full salaries, and the employees of the Ministry of Industry issued full salaries, while the staff first withdrew 40% to 50% on credit. The remaining ministries and commissions issued 20% to 30% to 40% to 50% depending on their financial resources. Only a certain association had no decorations. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Li Zhongming Discusses the Course of the Guizhou Rebellion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Zhongming of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee came to Nanjing and said that in the middle of last month, You Guocai's troops advanced into southern Guizhou, and Jiang Zaizhen's troops invaded northern Guizhou. Wang Jialie immediately ceded the eight counties of Panjiang as You's defense zone. Later, Long Yun mediated, and the war in southern Guizhou was extinguished. Jiang Zaizhen's troops had captured Tongzi and reached Banqiao, 70 li north of Zunyi City. After Hou Zhidan's troops attacked from Renhuai on the flank, Jiang's troops fled to Suiyang and met with Yang Qichang's troops, who were invading northern Guizhou from Nanchuan. When they reached Taping, they were attacked again and routed. Yesterday, a telegram from Guizhou stated that Jiang and Yang had both retreated into Sichuan. As for the claim that Jiang's troops had captured Songkan, since Songkan is the border between Sichuan and Guizhou, connected to Qijiang in Sichuan to the north and Tongzi in Guizhou to the south, it may be a fact that Jiang's troops retreated through it.

<h3>Russian Guardsmen in the Vicinity of Harbin</h3>
<p>Accused</p>
<p>(Harbin) Recently, a shooting occurred in the Chenghe (transliteration) area. Three bandits were chased by two Russian members of the guard, Bao Qinggu and Ke Luoying. As a result, one bandit was killed by them. According to local newspapers, the two Russians and the Russian leader of the Chenghe Guard, Luo Zhafu, have been arrested because the relatives of the dead bandit have filed a complaint.

<h3>Jiang Orders Liu and Deng to Cease Fire</h3>
<p>Those Who Do Not Obey Central Government Orders Will Be Punished</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that since capturing Chongning, Liu Wenhui, the commander of the 24th Army, has occupied the south bank of the Pi River. He originally planned to take advantage of the victory to cross the river and advance north, but the 28th Army, led by Deng Xihou, defended the river firmly, and the 29th Army, led by Tian Songyao, arrived to reinforce them, making it difficult to fight one against two. He changed his plan and launched a fierce attack on Huaizhou with three divisions and appointed Chen Hongwen as the commander-in-chief of the attack on Huaizhou. On the 14th, the attack began. The center of the battle shifted to the Chongguan line downstream of the Pi River, and the situation in the upstream became quiet. The garrison commander of Huaizhou was Chen Shunong, the division commander of Deng's army. He came into contact with Liu's army that day. Tian Songyao originally sent two divisions led by Huang Futang and Zeng Nanfu to Deyang and Shifang to assume upstream defense duties. He sent another two brigades of the Dong Zongheng Division to aid Huaizhou, stationed at Zhao Jia Ferry near Huaizhou, as an outpost of Deng's army, and engaged in fierce fighting with the 24th Army. At this point, Tian's army formally joined the whirlpool. Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou, two units, had previously been ordered by Liu Xiang to concentrate in Lezhi and Yangxian in preparation for armed suppression. Li and Luo sympathized with Deng and would join forces with Deng's troops to attack Jianyang. Once launched, the situation would change again. In addition to ordering Li and Luo to take advantage of opportunities, Liu Xiang's direct line troops, such as Pan Wenhua and Fan Shaozeng's units, had indeed secretly advanced towards Jianjia. It is heard that Jianwei has already entered the Chongqing military range. If they go deeper into Jiading, Liu Wenhui's capture of Huaizhou in one fell swoop would not be enough to compensate for his loss. Liu Xiang would gain without fighting. Liu had previously sent a telegram to persuade both sides to cease hostilities. He has now received replies from Liu and Deng, mutually passing responsibility for the war. Liu Wenhui's telegram briefly stated, "Since leaving the province in Jinkang, the distance has been shocking. Mutual stimulation and collision have led to the current situation of disputes. As for the actions of the Jin troops, like an arrow on a string, there is no way to avoid it. I only hope that the situation does not spread. Now, I am only acting in self-defense and have ordered my subordinates to adhere to your wishes and not to go too far." Deng Lei briefly stated, "Xihou was ordered to suppress bandits this time and was drawing forces from Xindu. He unexpectedly attacked Wenjian with heavy troops and forcibly occupied various organs in the province. He sent 30 to 40 regiments to attack my Fan, Xin, Chong, and Guan counties. Xihou had no choice but to make a legitimate defense and did not cross the defense line by one step, but Liu's troops continued to attack without stopping. I cannot understand his purpose in fighting. I request that he be sanctioned by force so that the ferocious and stubborn know to be vigilant." Both sides have no thorough understanding of ceasing hostilities and making peace, which shows the stubbornness of the Sichuan warlords. They will not stop until both sides are injured. Chiang Kai-shek, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression stationed in Jiangxi, was deeply saddened to hear that the Sichuan war had expanded. He repeatedly telegraphed both sides to strictly stop it. Recently, he summoned representatives of the Sichuan army in Nanchang and gave instructions, saying, "The national crisis is becoming more urgent, and the Red bandits have not been eliminated. I hope that the generals of the Sichuan army will preserve some personality for the country and avoid being despised by the world. In addition to ordering Liu and Deng to return to their original defenses and wait for a solution, each representative should telegraph their respective armies to immediately cease hostilities. Regardless of which army occupies the other's defense line, the Central Government will order them to return. If they do not comply, they will be punished." After the representatives received the instructions, they telegraphed their respective armies, urging them to cease hostilities. Can the Sichuan warlords stop before it is too late after this strict order? (27th)</p>
<h3>Severe Frost and Hail Disaster in Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>No Harvest Expected in Guanzhong and Yulin</p>
<p>The Livelihood of the Surviving Victims Is Completely Cut Off</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xi'an states that Shaanxi Province has suffered from continuous drought for years, and the rural areas are bankrupt. Since the sowing of wheat seedlings last autumn, there has been a great lack of rain and snow, and most of the crops have withered.

It was expected that there would still be a harvest of 20% to 30% this summer, and the surviving people could recover slightly. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of May, they suffered from black frost, strong winds, and hail. Flying sand and stones caused houses to collapse, and wheat, beans, melons, and cotton were all destroyed. People were very panicked, and their livelihoods were completely cut off.

<h3>Current Status of Inland Water Transportation in Sichuan</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: River transportation in Sichuan relies solely on steamships and motorboats.

<h3>Hopeful Resolution for Waterway Disputes in Northern Shandong</h3>
<p>Construction Department Plans to Renovate Canal Dikes</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, previously went to Enxian and Wucheng counties to investigate disputes arising from the construction of river dikes. He also studied solutions with local officials and residents from both counties. He returned to Jinan last night. Today, Mr. Zhang went to the Provincial Government to meet Chairman Han Fuqu, reporting on the investigation of the canal and the process of consulting local opinions for solutions. It was generally agreed that renovating the canal dikes was necessary to resolve the disputes. Mr. Han agreed and decided that the Provincial Government would subsidize 10,000 yuan, while Enxian and Wucheng counties would each raise 5,000 yuan to complete the project. After returning to the department, Zhang Honglie instructed his staff to draft detailed plans overnight, aiming to submit them to the Provincial Government tomorrow. This afternoon, the reporter visited Zhang at the Construction Department, inquiring about the meeting with Han and the content of the solutions. According to Mr. Zhang, "The dispute between Enxian and Wucheng counties stems from flooding. If we renovate the canal dikes once and for all, we can avoid flooding and naturally resolve the disputes. Because the dikes of the Northern Canal have too many bends, the water flow is not smooth. There are more than a dozen dangerous sections on the eastern bank of the canal near the junction of Enxian and Wucheng counties. During the continuous rains of summer, the river dikes collapse, flooding Enxian from the Sha River. Enxian then builds dikes to block the Sha River water, harming Wucheng, hence the disputes. Previously, Wucheng allowed Enxian to build dikes, stipulating that the height should not exceed six feet, but during heavy rains, the highest water level of the canal reaches two and a half meters. A six-foot dike, of course, cannot stop the water, and the disputes cannot be resolved, and have recently escalated, leading to armed clashes and tragic loss of life. This time, I personally went to Enxian and Wucheng counties, convened meetings with the people, explained the importance of righteousness, and studied solutions with the two county magistrates. Fortunately, everyone was able to set aside their biases and was willing to work together to renovate the canal dikes and permanently eliminate flooding. Enxian must help Wucheng, and Wucheng must also help Enxian. However, both counties are inherently poor. Enxian has already levied 15 or 16 yuan per mu, which is already unsustainable. If we want to complete this project, we must rely on the Provincial Government for assistance. I have just met with Chairman Han, who has decided to order Enxian and Wucheng counties to each contribute 5,000 yuan, and the province will subsidize 10,000 yuan, making 20,000 yuan as construction costs, with the two counties providing labor to complete the work. As for the detailed plans, the department is currently drafting them and will be completed tomorrow. If we can start construction soon, Enxian and Wucheng counties can be free from flooding this year, and there will be no more disputes," and so on. (27th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Investigates Wuhu</h3>
<p>Case of Illegal Sale of National Territory</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Although Wuhu is one of the trading ports in the Yangtze River basin, it still lacks a concession in the treaty system. However, in recent years, excellent areas near the wharves along the river, such as Shishan Mountain, Shizi Mountain, Fenghuang Mountain, Qingshan Mountain, Tieshan Mountain, and along the Xijiang River, have been occupied by foreigners under the guise of foreign firms, companies, schools, hospitals, residential villas, and so on. Through gradual encroachment and annexation, these areas have long become special regions, significantly affecting Wuhu's commerce and culture. In June of last year, the Wuhu Orphanage, citing financial difficulties, attempted to privately sell 40 mu of land located along the Xijiang River to the Texaco Oil Company to build oil storage tanks. After learning of this, various sectors believed that it would not only harm territorial sovereignty but also that the oil storage tanks would affect local public safety, and filed petitions with the provincial government, as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, requesting strict prohibition. Only then was the matter averted. Recently, a Hong, in collusion with Tang Jinzhou and others, fabricated the names of three households, Tang Jingji, Tang Jingshentang, and Xue Yuji, to purchase dozens of mu of land along the Xijiang River and then illegally sell it to a merchant from a certain country. They also obtained a certificate from Zhou Mengwen, the manager of Li Bohang, a major landlord in Wuhu, to vouch for them at the county government, and paid the tax on the land deed. The county government initially believed that it was a transfer of property rights between people of the same country and collected the tax according to regulations, without refusing. Soon after, the county party headquarters and various sectors discovered that these individuals were actively proceeding with the resale to a certain foreign national after obtaining the tax deed, which caused great astonishment. They immediately submitted petitions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, the Anhui Provincial Government, and the Provincial Party Headquarters, requesting prompt investigation and prohibition to protect sovereignty. After receiving the petitions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to quickly investigate the truth. The provincial government and the provincial party headquarters dispatched Ye Renshan, director of the fourth section of the construction department, to Wuhu to investigate the matter. He is currently reviewing the case files and conducting on-site inspections in order to report back. (24th)</p>

<p>Supervisory Institute Secretly Investigates Riot by Refugees</p>
<p>In February of this year, more than 160 refugees from Shouzhou, northern Anhui, arrived at Yanjiaqiao, Tangxiangbian, District 8 of this county and wantonly caused disturbances. The town's chamber of commerce came forward to dissuade them, but the refugees refused to comply. The chamber of commerce fired warning shots into the sky, and stray bullets injured the refugees Zhang Yude and others. Zhang and others reported the injuries to the county court prosecutor's office for examination and accused the chamber of commerce members of attempted murder. After investigation, the prosecutor's office concluded that the chamber of commerce members did not use excessive force for self-defense and decided not to prosecute. However, at the time of the incident, the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association repeatedly submitted appeals to various departments and commissions of the Central National Government and various agencies of the provincial government. After receiving the report, Yu Youren, the President of the Supervisory Yuan, specially sent his secretary, Mr. Wang Jingqing, to Wuxi to secretly investigate. He went to the county court to review the submissions from both sides and the testimonies of various people, and visited Tangxiangbian, the site of the incident, the ancient temple that housed the refugees, Dr. Chen Shuliang, who treated the refugees, and the 16th branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge of the area, to investigate the circumstances of the disturbance at the time and the police's suppression efforts. He conducted a thorough investigation, stayed in Wuxi for three days, and returned to Nanjing yesterday to report back.</p>

At this time of year, when the new and old harvests were not yet joined, the family had run out of food and grass. The family of four had been without food for three days. The wife cried and the children wailed, which was unbearable to hear. Pan, in a moment of despair, conceived a thought of world-weariness, so on the previous (23rd) day, he took advantage of his wife's absence and hanged himself with a hemp rope. Although both children were by his side, they were young and did not know how to call for help. By the time his wife returned home, he had already breathed his last. It was truly tragic.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Citizens Indict Former County Magistrate Wu</p>
<p>Zheng Zhong, the head of the dispatch department of this county, committed suicide by smoking opium after being slapped and intimidated by County Magistrate Wu Wentai. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Wu has now been transferred to Shanghai. The family of the deceased, through mediation by others, withdrew the charges. Citizens such as Lin Dalun were greatly dissatisfied upon hearing this and immediately telegraphed the High Court, requesting a fair trial in accordance with the law. A full transcript of the original telegram is provided below. "To the esteemed High Court: The case of Wu Wentai, the former magistrate of Pinghu County, forcing dispatch clerk Zheng Zhong to commit suicide upon his departure, has caused a public outcry in the local and Shanghai-Hangzhou newspapers. The family of the deceased, Zheng Hu, has already filed a complaint with Examiner Chen, who confirmed the facts, and sent a telegram to your court requesting a thorough investigation. It has now come to our attention that Wu Wentai, knowing that he cannot escape the law, has instigated local bullies such as Xu Meixuan to coerce and lure the family of the deceased to withdraw the charges, which is clearly a private settlement of a murder case and a great violation of the law. As this case falls purely within the scope of criminal law, it cannot be freely started or stopped. Fearing that officials will protect each other and the spirit of the law will be lost, we, the citizens, dare not remain silent. We hereby telegraph you to reject the request to withdraw the charges and to promptly designate jurisdiction to conduct a fair trial to comfort the wronged soul and rectify official corruption."</p>

<h3>After Takahashi Decides to Stay On</h3>
<p>Japanese Political Situation Remains Unstable</p>
<p>Seiyukai Tries Hard to Make Things Difficult for Saitō</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Japan United News Agency, 28th – Although the political world temporarily stabilized after Finance Minister Takahashi decided to stay on, the Seiyukai Party is extremely indignant towards the government, and as a result, the political situation has once again fallen into an unstable state. The Seiyukai Party is now divided into two factions internally. One faction advocates for an immediate break with the current cabinet, while the other believes that the time is not yet ripe and prefers to adopt a self-restrained attitude and observe the situation quietly. However, the influence of the pro-break faction is gradually increasing, so President Suzuki has not dared to make a definitive decision lightly. Those who want to maintain the current cabinet, those who want to take advantage of the Seiyukai Party's tough attitude, and those who are trying to realize the Suzuki cabinet, the Hiranuma cabinet, and the Ugaki cabinet are all conducting separate activities. However, the government side, because of Takahashi's determination to fulfill his mission, believes that even if the Seiyukai Party breaks away, it will not be difficult to reorganize the cabinet, and they remain optimistic. Therefore, the political situation can be maintained for the time being. However, when it comes to compiling the budget, there will inevitably be a considerable amount of tension between the government and the Seiyukai Party.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Japan United News Agency, 28th – Although the Japanese political world is currently stable, its future is clouded by dark clouds and does not allow for optimism. According to observations from various factions, the future trend of the political situation is as follows: (1) The House of Peers, President Suzuki, and the government are at odds, and Finance Minister Takahashi's feelings have worsened since Takahashi stayed on as finance minister. However, the Seiyukai Party is divided internally, so the issue of a break cannot be easily implemented. Prime Minister Saitō and President Suzuki should decide on their attitudes early and strive to dispel the dark clouds. (2) The Minseitō Party believes that the Seiyukai Party currently lacks a great politician who can see through the political situation, so they cannot decide on a definite attitude until the time comes to compile the budget. If the Seiyukai Party implements a break at that time, the Minseitō Party will uphold the current cabinet according to its established policy, exclude the Seiyukai Party's conspiracy, and do its best to make it easier for Saitō to reorganize the cabinet. Therefore, no matter what attitude the Seiyukai Party takes, the political situation will not undergo major changes. (3) The Kokumin Domei Party believes that the party is the only opposition party and has always firmly believed that a political upheaval will occur during the budget compilation period. Therefore, the party is united as one to prepare to take over the cabinet.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, 28th – The young and radical members of the Seiyukai Party will hold a meeting of members tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. to express their tough stance of immediately breaking away from the current cabinet and urge President Suzuki to make a decision.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, 28th – Seiyukai President Suzuki is paying close attention to the trends of the radical and self-restrained factions within the party, and has ordered the leaders of Shimada, Matsuno, Yamazaki, and others to visit the party elders to gather information. However, the general trend of the party is that the argument for immediate disaffiliation is gradually gaining strength. If there is a major cause, even those who advocate self-restraint will not strongly oppose immediate disaffiliation. President Suzuki seems to have realized this and made a decision internally, so the period for the Seiyuukai to sever ties with the government may be brought forward, and it may be carried out before the budget is compiled, as early as late June.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, 28th – The Kokumin Domei Party held a general assembly today at 3:00 p.m. President Adachi and Secretary-General Yamamichi, Nakano, Kiyose, Furuya, and others discussed countermeasures to the current situation. At that time, President Adachi's speech was as follows: The speculation that Finance Minister Takahashi's agreement to stay on has allowed the Saitō cabinet to be maintained and the political situation to stabilize belongs to the legal community. The political situation is of course even more unstable, and the existing political parties will tend to collapse. It is a mistake to say that the extraordinary situation has now been resolved and we have returned to the normal path of constitutionalism, or to say that the extraordinary situation has not yet been resolved, so the current cabinet should be maintained. The credibility of political parties has not yet been restored in any way. At the same time, there are those who advocate that the current situation is extraordinary and the cabinet should be changed. However, if the situation is extraordinary, the incompetent and inactive cabinet should be overthrown, the political parties should be reformed, and we should move forward to establish countermeasures for an extraordinary situation.</p>
<h3>Mastermind of Assassination Plot Against Saitō</h3>
<p>Sentenced to One and a Half Years in Prison, Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Japan United News Agency, 28th – Imamaki Yoshio, a medical doctor and member of the Shinbu Society who masterminded the plot to assassinate Prime Minister Saitō, was sentenced by the presiding judge at the Tokyo District Court on the 27th to one year and six months in prison, suspended for two years.</p>
<h3>Austria-Germany Discord Intensifies</h3>
<p>Hitler's Party Members Demand Austrian Chancellor's Resignation</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from Reuters, 27th – The Austrian government's plan to suppress the National Socialist Party has aroused the anger of the German National Socialist Party. As a retaliatory measure, the German government is charging German citizens traveling to Austria a passport fee of 1,000 marks. At the same time, the headquarters of the National Socialist Party issued a declaration demanding the resignation of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and the formation of a government of national concentration, saying that without this, there would be no way to maintain Austria's economic, political, and cultural security. Dr. Goebbels originally intended to travel to Rome via Austria, but has now decided not to pass through Vienna and will fly directly to Rome tonight.</p>
<p>Vienna Dispatch from the National News Agency, 27th – When Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss went to the university today to participate in a memorial service held by the Catholic Student Association for soldiers who died in the European War, several disputes arose among the students, and they even fought in front of the Chancellor. The Chancellor then left the venue immediately and refused to attend. The university has been temporarily closed.</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from the National News Agency, 27th – The German government has newly ordered that all German people who wish to transit to Guangdong must pay an exit passport fee of 1,000 marks, which, at the current exchange rate, is approximately 70 gold pounds. This harsh order is tantamount to severing traffic between Germany and Austria, so that, apart from border merchants who can continue to travel between the two countries, all other travelers are completely banned. The biggest reason for this move is that the animosity between the German and Austrian governments is deepening day by day, and the authorities are particularly hostile to figures of the National Socialist Party, resulting in the promulgation of a law prohibiting them from wearing National Socialist Party uniforms and badges. The German authorities, in view of this, and because it is difficult to distinguish whether Germans passing through Austria are members of the National Socialist Party, have decided to adopt a heavy tax system for the convenience of management and to avoid unfortunate incidents between Germans and the Austrian government, in order to show that the prohibition is implicit in the tax.</p>
<p>Vienna Dispatch from the National News Agency, 27th – The German government's new order requiring those leaving the country to Austria to pay an exit passport fee of 1,000 marks has greatly surprised the Austrian government. It is said that a countermeasure plan will be taken to prohibit the transfer of mark accounts. This move will greatly hinder commercial relations between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Hitler Plans to Sway</h3>
<p>Danzig Election with Speech</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from Reuters, 27th – German Chancellor Hitler today broadcast a radio message from Munich, asking the people of Danzig to remain loyal to the Germanic nation throughout today's general election, saying that National Socialism does not know of policies that harm others or change borders, and that National Socialism does not want to start a war in order to force those who do not want to and cannot be merged with Germans to merge with Germans. Therefore, the National Socialist Party is careful to limit itself to those who are Germanic, of Germanic blood, and speak the Germanic language.</p>
<p>Danzig Dispatch from Reuters, 28th – Today's general election in Danzig was very quiet. Many Danzigers came here by car from Germany to vote, but because they were not Danzig residents, they were not allowed to vote.</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from the National News Agency, 27th – All of Europe is eagerly awaiting the results of tomorrow's election in the Free City of Danzig. Internally, this is a competition between the National Socialist Party and the parties that support the principle of individual freedom. Internationally, this is a competition between Poland and Germany. The future of the Free City will depend on this move. There are fears that the political struggle will become fierce and cause an incident, but according to news late today, everything is quiet.</p>
<p>Danzig Free City Dispatch from Havas, 28th – The re-election of the Danzig Free City Council began at 9:00 a.m. this morning. There are nine types of candidate lists from various parties, namely the National Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, the Center Party, the German National People's Party, the Landowners' Party, the German Youth Party, and two candidate lists of Polish people. The city is covered with black, white, and red flags, especially the swastika flag. The National Socialist Party held a grand parade with 20 to 30 cars, full of parade participants, with flags hanging on the cars and election slogans posted, slowly parading through the streets.

<h3>50 Million People to Visit</h3>
<p>Chicago Exposition</p>
<p>Chicago Dispatch from Reuters, 27th – When the Chicago World's Fair opened tonight, visitors were already streaming in. The organizers expect 50 million visitors to come from all over. The venue is built next to Lake Michigan, and the exhibition will last until November. Chicago was once a wilderness 100 years ago, and today's exhibition is to celebrate the progress of the past century. Chicago has held an exhibition once before, exactly 40 years ago.</p>
<h3>Woodin Greatly Scolds "Rascals"</h3>
<p>Washington Dispatch from the National News Agency, 27th – Senator Couzens claimed in the Senate Banking Committee that a senior government official had called the committee's lawyer and chief investigator Pecora a "rascal," seemingly joining the campaign to discredit Pecora. However, even if Pecora is removed, the investigation will continue, and someone equally loyal and capable will be hired to handle the matter. The senior official refers to Secretary of the Treasury Woodin, but Couzens did not mention his name. At the same time, another committee member stated that Roosevelt himself said that the investigation should proceed as before, regardless of who is involved. Another committee member also said that Couzens is too idealistic, and those involved in the case may not necessarily include those who want to make things difficult for the investigators. The committee will continue to inquire about the Morgan Bank's issuance of foreign bonds on Wednesday. However, the issuance of foreign bonds is often jointly participated in by several large banks, and the inside story may become more complex.</p>
<h3>The German Crisis Is Still Deeply Hidden (Berlin Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Unemployment Has Not Decreased, Entrepreneurs' Debts Have Increased</p>
<p>The Government Is Heavily Indebted, and the Disarmament Problem Is the Most Difficult to Solve</p>
<p>It has been almost four months since Hitler came to power. How are his political achievements? It will not be seen until after his four-year term. We cannot see it now. However, when he came to power, he promoted three major agendas. The first was to reform the chaotic labor organization, especially to suppress the Communist Party. The second was to restore the harmonious movement between labor and capital. The third was to increase the internal strength of all industrial sectors. These are the economic policies that the German Federal Economic Conference has passed to be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>Now the activities of the Communist Party have stopped on the surface, and the books of Marx, Lenin, and even Kautsky cannot be sold publicly. The labor organization has almost become an underground movement, and even the trade unions led by the Social Democratic Party have been greatly destroyed, and they are also considered to be contrary to the German "national spirit." However, the poverty situation in the rural areas may actually be better than that of our motherland, the Republic of China, but we have never seen or heard of any emergency relief measures. Therefore, the prices of agricultural products are very different from the prices of industrial products. For example, in the price index in March of this year, the wholesale price of agricultural products (assuming 1913 is 100) was 81.6 in March of this year, while the price of refined industrial products maintained a high level of 111.5. The decline of animal husbandry is even more serious than that of agriculture. Therefore, the Hitler government is studying how to raise the prices of butter and milk. The reason is that relieving the rural areas and revitalizing the rural areas means directly finding outlets for industrial products and opening up the domestic market. Only one-fifth of German industrial products are sold to farmers, so the recovery of rural areas has a great impact on industry. However, the German government's ability to implement this is still a question. Moreover, the unemployed masses are in the same position as the farmers and are suffering a tragic fate. If we want to talk about restoring market prosperity, we must not let the more than six million unemployed masses take their own course and stand idly by. Therefore, successive German governments have paid great attention to this and have done their best to invest huge amounts of money to relieve the unemployed. Recently, Hitler has proposed 125 million marks from the national treasury to help the unemployed find work in public works projects. Its effectiveness is almost the same as the American "Civilian Conservation Corps" organization for 250,000 unemployed workers. The scope is narrow, and the number of people who are relieved is limited compared to the total number of unemployed. He wants to recruit the unemployed masses from all over the streets and lanes, and at the same time use public welfare to encourage the masses to improve the government's ability to implement economic policies and its credibility, and to harvest the greatest effect with the least amount of labor in economic theory.</p>
<p>Hitler's real power is much greater than the dictatorial power given to the US President by the US Congress. All the national institutions within the German Federation are at Hitler's disposal, and he also has a Minister of Propaganda who often orders the government and its policies to be promoted, awakening public opinion, and focusing on the tasks designated by the government.</p>
<p>However, the German economy has shown signs of rising since February of this year, and the market has gradually turned around. However, to what extent the new forces can reach is still unpredictable. Therefore, what will the first stage of economic recovery look like? How much automatic recovery and adjustment capacity does the economy have? No one dares to make a rash judgment. Moreover, there are still many hidden dangers in front of us.</p>
<p>First, the purchasing power of the general public is still very low and is not easy to recover for a while, let alone exceed the previous level.</p>
<p>Second, the reduction of the unemployed masses is only due to seasonal factors, and it is not necessarily better than the same period last year, so it will inevitably be worse after this summer than last year.</p>
<p>Third, the burden of debt on entrepreneurs is increasing day by day. Borrowing new debts to repay old debts is definitely not a way out, and foreign trade has not improved. Germany is also a country that exports more than it imports. Even if the World Economic Conference discusses a fairly appropriate method, it may not be exactly what Germany needs. Then the German business community may not have hope of revival. Fourth, although reparations have been suspended, they can be said to be virtually suspended. However, Germany's total foreign debt is 22.8 billion marks. Even if political debt is excluded, it is still 21.3 billion marks. Taking its opponent as an example, the United Kingdom's foreign debt is only 10 billion marks, and France's is only 12 billion marks. How can such a huge debt be repaid?</p>
<p>The last one is a world problem, and it is also the most difficult, most difficult, and most dangerous disarmament problem between Germany and France. German citizens, especially members of the National Socialist Party and quasi-National Socialist Party members, believe that highly armed countries (such as France) are unwilling to reduce their armaments, so they ignore Germany's demand for equality in armaments. Germany insists on "equality in armaments," otherwise it will automatically deny the Treaty of Versailles and increase its armaments according to its capacity. However, from the perspective of France or the United Kingdom, Germany's 100,000 national defense forces have a service period of up to seven years, and their training subjects are all subjects of the school. The materials for German military weapons are also very good. At the same time, the National Socialist Party has assault teams, and the National People's Party has iron helmet regiments. They have all fully implemented military training. Even if they cannot be considered a formal combat army, they can awaken the narrow patriotic spirit of their general public, thereby causing a political crisis in Europe. In fact, even if Germany itself realizes "equality in armaments," it will only increase the burden on the people. Everyone knows that real welfare is very unreliable and there is a risk of causing great disaster. However, there is absolutely no freedom of speech in Germany today, so no one dares to mention it, let alone oppose equality in armaments. We can only let the crisis increase.

<h3>Peace Talks Will Proceed to the Second Step</h3>
<p>Ceasefire Method Has Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Tungchow Refugees Return to Their Hometowns One After Another</p>
<p>The Pingzheng Council Can Be Established in One Day</p>
<p>Special News from Beiping: After the crisis in Pingjin turned into safety, the principles agreed upon on the 23rd will be followed. The first step is to discuss the ceasefire method. After the ceasefire method is agreed upon and the temporary defense lines are drawn, a considerable solution will be sought diplomatically. On the afternoon of the 23rd, personnel were sent to Miyun to discuss everything. The Japanese side also sent personnel to Ping. The temporary defense lines of the two armies in the front were agreed upon the day before yesterday (24th) and have been implemented yesterday (25th). Both sides sent personnel to inspect the defense. The first step, the ceasefire method and all procedures, is roughly in place. Tomorrow (27th), the second step can be carried out to discuss diplomatic issues. Today (26th), there was another important meeting at Fengzeyuan. Huang He, Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Qun, He Qigong, and others all attended to further discuss military, political, and diplomatic affairs. Huang is scheduled to visit relevant personnel in Ping tomorrow (27th) to start contacts. The future of peace is hopeful.</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet troops advancing on Pingjin have also gradually withdrawn since the night before last. The Japanese army in Tungchow has crossed the river and retreated east, temporarily stationed in Xixia and Yanfu. The army in Shunyi has retreated to the north of Niulanshan. The enemies north of Changping have also retreated to the vicinity of Huairou. Each line has retreated more than 20 li. The Japanese and puppet troops in Lutai withdrew east yesterday morning and are now stationed in Xugezhuang, Tangshan, and other places. Li Jichun's puppet army in Ninghe also showed signs of retreat today. The Beining train passed through to Lutai last night. Two armored trains of our army are parked at Lutai Station today. After the Japanese army withdrew from each route, our army did not advance.</p>
<p>Japanese aircraft still went to various places for reconnaissance today. Three planes went to Tungchow and Tanggu, and four planes went to Tianjin. Two planes were also found over the city of Beiping this morning at about 10:00 a.m., one was a biplane and the other was a monoplane. They circled once and flew away without dropping bombs or distributing leaflets. The people of Ping have become accustomed to Japanese aircraft. Since the atmosphere of peace has become strong, they are more calm. When Japanese aircraft arrived in Ping today, the citizens looked up at them, unlike the busy escape in the past few days.</p>
<p>The internal organization of the Administrative Yuan's Ping Political Affairs Consolidation Committee stationed in Ping has been roughly agreed upon. The scope of the Secretariat is wider and it has already begun to be organized. Political and financial affairs, due to Wang Shuhan being in Tianjin and Wang Kemin being ill, have not been able to prepare quickly. Now that Wang Jingwei has sent a telegram urging them to be established as soon as possible, Huang has telegraphed to all the committee members who are not in Beiping to come to Ping immediately for discussions so that they can be formally established in the shortest possible time. Zhang Zhitang came to Ping from Tianjin last night, and Wang Shuhan also rushed to arrive this morning. Zhang and Wang met with Huang at Fengzeyuan this morning to discuss everything. The original Political Affairs Committee and Finance Committee were completely closed, and all affairs were transferred to the Pingzheng Council's political and financial affairs offices. Wang Shuhan and Wang Kemin were originally standing committee members of the Political Affairs Committee and the Finance Committee. They have handled most of the affairs and are familiar with the work, so they can be competent and happy. The meeting site has been determined to be in the old Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Finance Consolidation Committee. It is now scheduled to be formally established on June 1.</p>
<p>Another special message: The Sino-Japanese peace movement has been satisfactory since the two sides began to carry it out. There are rumors that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded and that consultations have reached a considerable level. Officials are still unwilling to make a definite statement, so whether it is reliable or not cannot be proven. However, since the 23rd, the military on the front line has indeed eased. On the night of the 22nd, Tungchow was once tense. At that time, Japanese tanks crossed the river and invaded the west, approaching the suburbs. Tungchow City fell into chaos. Initially, our cavalry tried their best to resist, and the people were anxious to escape, losing a lot of property, and women were especially frightened. Order had been lost. Fortunately, Pang Bingxun's troops arrived and repelled the Japanese army. Since then, the atmosphere of peace has become strong, and the dangerous period in Pingjin has gradually passed. The main force of the Japanese army near Tungchow went east the day before yesterday (24th) and is now concentrated in Xixia, east of Yanjiao Town. It is estimated that there are about 1,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery units stationed in that area, as well as tanks and</p>
<h3>Japanese Students' Movement to Support Academic Freedom</h3>
<p>Kyoto Dispatch from the Japan United News Agency, 28th – The movement of 2,360 students from the Department of Law and the Department of Economics of Kyoto Imperial University to support academic freedom is gradually intensifying. Students from the Department of Literature will also participate in this movement. The atmosphere throughout the university is very tense.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Japan United News Agency, 28th – The President of Kyoto Imperial University, Konishi, went to Tokyo on the 27th to make final negotiations with the Ministry of Education. He stayed at the Kanda Hitotsubashi Scholars' Hall last night. At 8:30 a.m. on the 28th, he hid his resignation letter and went to the Minister of Education's official residence. He met with Minister of Education Tsuyama, Vice Ministers Tōgō and Awaya, Officer Ishizaka, Director of the Specialized Academic Affairs Bureau Akakusa, Chief Secretary Kikusawa, and others in the Minister's room. Konishi reported the decision of the professors of the Department of Law to resign en masse and the students to withdraw from school en masse, the progress of the Deliberation Committee, and other various situations within the school. Later, he submitted his resignation letter. However, Konishi's resignation letter has not been approved by the Deliberation Committee, and how the Ministry of Education will handle it is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Japan United News Agency, 28th – When Konishi, President of Kyoto University, submitted his resignation letter today, the Minister of Education advised him to resign after resolving everything because the academic storm has the potential to expand. However, Konishi resolutely resigned. As a result, it was decided that Konishi would return to Kyoto, convene a Deliberation Committee, and pass the resignation case. He will come to Kyoto another day to decide on this matter. Therefore, Konishi withdrew his resignation letter. Konishi told reporters, "I have decided to return to Kyoto to work hard to resolve this academic storm, but it is difficult to expect a satisfactory solution."</p>
<p>More than 30 armored vehicles. In the Mikawa area, there are more than 2,000 Japanese troops. Another 500 troops arrived today (26th). Although there are rumors that they are planning to attack south of Xianghe, there are no signs of this at present. Order in Tungchow has gradually been restored. Those who fled to Ping are returning one after another. The short express train between Ping and Tungchow is also running as usual. Most of the villagers are taking the opportunity to buy items for the Dragon Boat Festival to prepare to go home for the holiday. Their faces are not as gloomy as when they came. The shops in the area have already opened. After the Japanese army in Lutai retreated east along the Beining Railway, they are now stationed in Xugezhuang, Tangshan, and other areas. Two armored trains of our army are patrolling back and forth near Lutai Station to protect railway employees, repair tracks, and tidy up the platform. The Beining eastbound train has sold tickets to Lutai. The main force of the Japanese army under Xiyi has been stationed in Miyun. Xiyi is personally on the front line, and the headquarters is located in the city. Most of the residents there have fled to Beiping. There are still very few shops that have opened. Detailed plans are needed for all post-war arrangements in the war zone before they can be cleaned up.</p>
<p>The Ping Political Affairs Consolidation Committee stationed in Ping, after Mr. Huang Fu arrived in Ping and after many days of preparation, the internal organization has been completed. The original Beiping Political Affairs Committee and Finance Consolidation Committee will be abolished immediately, and all files will be transferred to the Consolidation Committee for processing. Mr. Wang Shuhan arrived in Ping from Tianjin this morning. Wang Kemin stumbled at Fengzeyuan before, broke his glasses, and one eye was injured by the glass. He was admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for treatment. He had surgery once, and the glass is still in his eye. After doctors and Wang's family members discussed the results, he will have another surgery within this week and will be difficult to be discharged from the hospital for a while. Therefore, the organization of the political and financial groups must be agreed upon with Mr. Wang Shuhan and Mr. Wang Kemin before a decision can be made. As for the monthly expenses of the Pingzheng Council, the central government will allocate 40,000 yuan per month. It is reported that the chairmen of the provinces in North China have decided to rush to arrive on June 1 to participate in the opening ceremony. The members in Tianjin and Shanghai have been invited by the Pingzheng Council and can arrive in Ping within the next few days. (May 26th)</p>
<h3>Actions of Japanese Warships in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The commander of the Japanese First Overseas Dispatch Fleet, Sakano Tsunezen, previously went from Hankou to Yichang and Chongqing for inspection, surveying the situation along the Yangtze River and spying on our movements. After returning to Hankou, he immediately convened a secret meeting and decided to redeploy defenses along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The warships Ataka, Uji, Futami, Tsushima, Sumida, Atami, and Kotaka were stationed, and the 24th Destroyer Squadron's Momo, Yanagi, Kashi, and Yari were sent to Yichang. The Fushimi warship was sent to Changsha, and the Katada warship was sent to Huangshi Port. They are paying particular attention to all our military intelligence and are sparing no effort in attempting to gather it. At a time when there are widespread rumors of ceasefire negotiations in North China, the Japanese still have such actions in the heart of the Yangtze River, which is enough to show that their schemes against us are truly all-encompassing. Today is Japanese Navy Day. All officers and soldiers of the Japanese warships docked in Hankou, as well as Japanese residents in Hankou, held a celebration at the Naval Assembly Hall in the Japanese Concession at 1:00 PM. Commander Sakano, Army Attaché Muto, Consul General Shimizu, Vice-Consul Tanaka, and others all gave speeches. At the same time, the warships fired celebratory salutes to mark the occasion.

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Issues a Circular Telegram Firmly Advocating Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>General Feng Yuxiang assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Zhangjiakou on the 26th of this month and issued a circular telegram to the whole country, stating in essence: Japanese imperialism's aggression against China is intensifying, with the ultimate goal of destroying our country and enslaving our nation, which will never change. Recently, the entire Great Wall line has been lost, and enemy forces are attacking Pingjin, publicly stating that they will take Zhangjiakou. Not only is Hebei and Chahar in danger, but everything north of the Yellow River will be lost. Yuxiang has been residing in Zhangjiakou for several months. Citizens and organizations from Pingjin, Shanghai, Guangdong, and other provinces have frequently sent messengers and telegrams, urging him to uphold righteousness and resist Japan. Yuxiang deeply believes that resisting foreign aggression and saving the country is the common responsibility and obligation of every citizen. Considering his own lack of talent and strength, he dares not avoid death and seek a life of ease. He respectfully obeys the expectations of the people in various regions and, on May 26, 1933, in the capacity of a citizen, assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army on the front lines of Chahar Province, leading like-minded soldiers and civilians to form an anti-Japanese front, armed to defend Chahar Province, recover lost territory, and strive for China's independence and freedom. He will use every bit of strength he has, and he will give his all, even to death.</p>
<h3>Su Bingwen's Son to Arrive in Shanghai Early Next Month</h3>

<p>According to the Riri News, Su Zongjun, the son of General Su Bingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army, and representative Fan Ruizheng, etc., went south from Ping to Beijing to visit important figures in the central government and report. They arrived in Shanghai on the evening before last at around 5:00 PM and are scheduled to take a boat together to Hong Kong tomorrow morning to welcome General Su back to the country. The Riri News reporter interviewed Mr. Su and Mr. Fan at the Datong Hotel yesterday, and according to their detailed conversation, the following is recorded:</p>
<h3>Central Government Expresses Great Satisfaction</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Fan, they are going south to welcome General Su back to the country and report to the central government authorities in Beijing. They have successively visited Chen Lifu of the Central Standing Committee, Ye Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Government, Peng Xuepei, Director of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Department, and Huang Musong, Special Envoy to Xinjiang. They all expressed admiration for General Su's anti-Japanese experience in Heilongjiang. They also expressed satisfaction that General Su's troops, returning from Russia to China and arriving in Xinjiang, were able to maintain local security during the Xinjiang incident, preventing the incident from escalating. As for General Su's return to the country, Chen, Ye, and others hoped that he would go to Beijing as soon as possible to discuss everything. Mr. Chen Lifu also told them that the central government has absolutely no room for compromise with Japan and will never sign treaties that cede rights and humiliate the country.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of the Troops in Chahar and Xinjiang</h3>
<p>According to Su Zongjun, the son of General Su, some of his father's troops have returned to China from Russia and are now in Xinjiang, and some are fighting in Liaoning and Rehe and are stationed in Chahar. They have all been reorganized by the central government. The troops in Xinjiang are the Independent First Brigade, led by Zheng Runcheng, the former commander of the Fourth Regiment, as acting brigade commander. The commander of the First Regiment is Sun Qinglin, and the chief of staff is Su Guo. The troops number more than 2,900 soldiers and a officers contingent of about 500, led by Captain An Yunge and Deputy Captain Niu Yuting, are all stationed in Dihua, maintaining security in the provincial capital. The guns are temporarily supplemented by those left by the remnants of the former Xinjiang Chairman Jin Shuren's troops. The troops in Chahar, together with the troops of Generals Ma Zhanshan, Deng Wen, Tai Binshan, Li Haiqing, etc., are stationed in Shangdu and are temporarily organized into an infantry brigade. The brigade commander is Tang Zongxin, and the regimental commanders are Li Chunyan, Chang Baozhen, and Guan Yuxiang. The troops number 3,800 soldiers, and only 70-80% of them have guns. They are now under the control of Liu Yifei, Commander-in-Chief of the North China Advancement Army. All the troops have been fighting hard for many years, and they are experiencing difficulties with clothing and supplies. The soldiers are still wearing old fur coats and cannot replace them, which shows how difficult their situation is.</p>
<h3>Representatives Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>General Su, along with General Ma Zhanshan and others, will arrive in Hong Kong on the third of next month on the Conte Rosso of the Italian Mailboat Company. Generals Li Du, Wang Delin, and others will also arrive in Hong Kong on the Sabbath Glengyle on the sixth.

<h3>Shanghai General Labor Union Denies General Strike Rumors</h3>
<p>Labor Circles Stepping Up Production to Strengthen National Power</p>
<p>Notice to All Labor Unions Not to Be Confused by Rumors</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, recently, there have been rumors outside that there will be a general shutdown of the market, a general strike, and a general class strike in this city. The Chamber of Commerce has issued a statement to refute these absurdities. The Shanghai General Labor Union also issued a formal statement yesterday, denying the rumors of a general strike, and notified all labor unions to pay close attention and not to be confused by villains.</p>
<p>Issuing a Statement: A member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai General Labor Union issued an important statement to a reporter from the Dagong News Agency yesterday, saying: The national crisis is extremely serious. All Chinese people should endure hardship, unite as one, and become the backing for resisting foreign aggression and wiping out humiliation. Merely watching from the sidelines and making empty talk that is divorced from reality will not help. Currently, the labor circles in this city are deeply aware of the heavy responsibilities they bear, concentrating their efforts, working hard, and increasing production to strengthen national power and overcome the crisis together. As for the recent labor-management disputes in this city, the union is making every effort to mediate them so that they can be resolved as soon as possible. Those that have not yet occurred are also being prevented. The report quoted Mayor Wu's statement that reactionary elements are planning to instigate a general strike among workers in Shanghai. But the union firmly believes that all workers in the city will be able to understand the overall situation and will not be exploited and act rashly. In short, in this national crisis, there is no way to survive without unity, and without strengthening national power, there is no way to talk about resisting Japan. We hope that all Chinese people will work together to achieve this.</p>
<p>Notice to Labor Unions: The union issued a notice to all labor unions yesterday, saying: "Regarding the notice, recently there have been many rumors, and some say that the labor circles in this city will hold a general strike. The national crisis is serious, and all the labor circles in our city are now united, implementing labor-management cooperation, and striving to increase production to fulfill our labor circles' important responsibility to save the country. The rumors are obviously spread by villains who are trying to undermine the union. In addition to issuing a statement, this union must also notify the said labor unions to pay close attention and instruct all workers not to be easily misled. This is extremely important. This is hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Da Nengxing Company Report</h3>
<p>Hesun Steamer Robbed</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen Passengers Kidnapped, Huge Losses</p>
<p>Company Has Telegraphed Military and Police Authorities to Pursue Vigorously</p>
<p>The Hesun steamer of the Da Nengxing Steamboat Company on Tiantang Street in this port was robbed by pirates outside Dagukou on the 21st of this month while sailing from Tianjin to Yingkou. More than a dozen passengers were kidnapped. The steamer has safely arrived in Yingkou. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pirates Robbed</p>
<p>The Hesun steamer of the Da Nengxing Company in Yingkou, carrying 1,100 tons, sailed from Tianjin to Yingkou on the evening of the 21st. Pirates disguised as passengers mixed in. When the steamer sailed outside Dagukou, the pirates launched an attack, first forcing the captain to turn the steamer towards the Bohai Sea and began to rob at the same time. The steamer was full of passengers who were fleeing the serious situation in Tianjin. All their clothes and silver were robbed. On the morning of the 22nd, the pirates took the robbed property and boarded a prepared small steamer and left. The steamer then sailed to Yingkou. Before leaving, the pirates kidnapped more than a dozen passengers. The names and the exact number of passengers kidnapped are unknown, but it is known that the losses were huge.</p>
<p>Company Telegrams to Inquire</p>
<p>The Hesun steamer was originally scheduled to arrive in Yingkou on the 22nd. When the steamer did not arrive on time, the Yingkou head office was very worried and immediately telegraphed the Tianjin, Dalian, and Shanghai branch offices and various customs offices to inquire. It was not until the evening of the 24th that the Hesun steamer safely arrived in Yingkou. The head office, in addition to telegramming the military and police authorities in Tianjin and Dagukou to vigorously pursue the pirates and rescue the kidnapped passengers, also telegraphed Shanghai to report the details.</p>
<h3>Levying Anti-Dumping Duties on Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>Determined Types to Be Implemented</p>
<p>Detailed Rules for Collection Have Been Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval</p>
<p>After approval, collection may begin in the middle of next month. The Ministries of Industry and Finance, in order to restrict the dumping of foreign goods, have specially created anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. The two ministries have organized foreign goods dumping situation and have transferred it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to order consuls stationed abroad to investigate the prices of goods nearby to determine whether they belong to dumping. It is now known that the investigation procedures have been completed, and the full text of the detailed rules for collection have also been drafted. The two ministries have submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review. Once passed, it will be announced by order of the Executive Yuan, and the customs offices throughout the country will begin collecting. However, it is heard that the collection standard for this anti-dumping duty is not universal for all goods, but only limited to foreign goods that conflict with our domestic products and hinder the sales of domestic goods. The ones that have been determined to be collected are cotton yarn, silk, tea, cloth, rice, wheat, timber, fish, light bulbs, matches, and other ten types. As for other necessary foreign goods, import duties will still be collected as usual, without collecting anti-dumping duties. As for the date of implementation, it is heard that it will be no later than the middle of next month.</p>

<h3>Shenxin Cotton Mill Resumes Work</h3>
<p>Labor and Management Make Concessions</p>
<p>Successful Conclusion</p>
<p>The Shenxin Old and New Cotton Mills in Zhoujiaqiao, western Shanghai, caused repercussions due to the cancellation of worker bonuses. After repeated negotiations by the labor union failed, all 9,000 male and female workers went on strike at 3:00 PM on the 26th. Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau, the head of the Sixth District, and representatives from the City Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union, and the Tenth District Cotton Textile Labor Union, etc., repeatedly tried to mediate between labor and management. After two days, a settlement was reached on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (27th), and all workers expressed satisfaction and immediately resumed work. Thus, a storm came to an end.</p>
<p>Mediation Process: At around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau and District Head Tan of the Sixth District arrived at the factory one after another and tried to persuade the workers in each department and asked the factory to understand the workers' pain and allow concessions. At 3:00 PM, Lu Yinchu, a representative of the City Party Headquarters, Wang Xuanqing, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Fan Luquan, of the Tenth District Cotton Textile Labor Union, and others, mediated between the two sides again. At the same time, Luo Yifu, the engineer of the old factory, Lü Xingtang, the engineer of the new factory, and Tang Mengxiong, the engineer of the weaving room, tried their best to persuade the workers in each department. At 7:00 PM, a settlement was reached. The factory agreed to be considerate, and all workers expressed satisfaction.</p>
<p>Settlement Conditions: (1) The bonuses for May will be paid as usual. The bonuses for June and beyond will be decided based on the situation of each factory. (2) For the two days and two nights of the strike, a total of four workdays, labor and management will each sacrifice two workdays. The factory will pay wages for two workdays.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work: When the day shift workers left the factory and the night shift workers arrived, the workers expressed satisfaction. The day shift workers dispersed and the night shift workers entered in an orderly manner. Officer Wei of the Sixth District also led the police to protect and maintain order. At 7:45 PM, more than 2,000 night shift workers resumed work and started the machines to work as usual. At 5:00 AM yesterday, more than 3,000 day shift workers arrived at the factory for work. Because it was the Dragon Boat Festival according to the old calendar, not all of them arrived. It is estimated that all of them will be at work today.</p>
<h3>Exporting Aged Silk with Government Subsidies</h3>
<p>Ninety Percent of 20,000 Dan Exported</p>
<p>Deadline Is May 31st</p>
<p>The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, in order to relieve the silk industry, issued 3 million yuan of short-term public bonds in 1932 and established the Committee for Promoting the Sale of Aged Factory Silk and the Committee for Organizing Aged Factory Silk and Aged Cocoons. For every dan of raw silk exported, a subsidy of 140 yuan is given. Now the two committees have been ordered to end at the end of this month and stop giving subsidies. The two committees have issued a notice as follows: "This committee is ordered to handle the export of subsidized aged factory silk. Now that 3 million yuan of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Short-Term Public Bonds of 1932 have been allocated, in addition to 200,000 yuan for the promotion fund, the remaining 2.8 million yuan is the export subsidy for 20,000 dan of aged silk. For every dan exported, 140 yuan of public bonds will be subsidized. As of today, 2,490,460 yuan of public bond certificates have been issued, leaving 309,540 yuan, which is only enough to subsidize the export of 2,211 dan of silk. If the total number of exports exceeds 20,000 dan by the end of May, this committee will submit a request to the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for instructions. From now until May 31, the order in which subsidies are issued will be based on the export ship dates and the export certificate numbers of the Jianghai Customs. This is hereby notified. May 27."</p>
<h3>Aviation Donation to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>A Letter from Zhang Yuliang</p>
<p>Zhang Yuliang sent a letter to Lin Mianzhai yesterday, saying: "To Mr. Mianzhai, I was surprised to read in the newspaper that I visited you yesterday to negotiate with the Aviation Association to extract aviation donations from your association. When I visited you yesterday, I merely said that I saw in the newspaper that your association had ordered aircraft, and I asked what the facts were. You replied that the report was nothing more than a propaganda effort to encourage the team leaders to pay the donations, and that the details should be asked of Director Zhang, who is responsible for handling the matter. I asked you to ask Director Zhang for me and reply by telephone or in writing, and then I left. Several hours have passed, and the words are still in my ears. Today's newspaper report is completely fabricated. I don't know if it's a mistake by the New News Agency or if you deliberately caused trouble. This concerns my moral character in my duties, and it is difficult for me to remain silent. Please reply. Zhang Yuliang."</p>
<h3>To Resist Japanese Goods and Promote Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>A Letter from University Students to Businessmen</p>
<p>Without Developing National Industries, It Is Not Enough to Resist Strong Neighbors</p>
<p>Without Completely Banning Japanese Goods, It Is Not Enough to Develop National Industries</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Goods Movement Committee of the Shanghai University Student Union held its second meeting yesterday. Liu Xiru presided over the meeting, and Ren Jimo took the minutes. Important matters were discussed and resolved: (1) How to promote the "Thrift Movement Week"? It was resolved to have the Propaganda Group draft a plan and conduct it in various schools separately. (2) Date of the next meeting: It was resolved to hold it on June 3rd at 1:00 PM, convened by the person in charge of culture. (3) To resist Japanese goods and promote domestic goods, a letter to Shanghai businessmen was resolved to be amended and passed. The meeting adjourned. The letter to businessmen is recorded below: "Japanese Pirates Act Rampantly, Harming Our China. They have seized Manchuria and invaded North China. Their ambitions are rampant, and they want to encompass our country and enslave our Chinese people. For more than a year, their troops have seized land and attacked cities, advancing step by step. Our troops have fought hard and retreated step by step, forming the current situation of broken mountains and rivers and endangering the heartland. If we continue to passively retreat, what will be left of the nation? Retracting a hundred miles a day, how many times can our territory be cut? If our compatriots think about this and reflect on the dangers facing the country, the nation, and their families, they should tremble with cold. However, to merely sit and sigh today is not enough to save the chronic illness. To shout loudly is not enough to support the precarious situation. To merely blame the government is not enough to save the country. To merely rely on military force is not enough to resist Japan. The great power and the life force to resist the enemy still rely entirely on our people to rise up and save themselves. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every man. The way to save the country is to do what we can. We cannot rush to the front and defend the country with weapons. We should also reflect on the pain and do our duty as citizens in the rear. What is the duty of the rear? What lies before us is to collect military supplies and provisions to maintain and solidify the front lines and to resist enemy goods to consolidate the foundation of the national economy. And to resist enemy goods and promote domestic goods is the most urgent task today. We know that for eighty years, due to the aggression of imperialists, China's rural economy has rapidly collapsed, and new industries have no way to develop, causing foreign goods to flood the market and local products to not leave the countryside. The dumping of Japanese goods is the biggest obstacle to domestic goods. Businessmen should know this even more clearly. Today's plan is that without developing national industries, it is not enough to resist strong neighbors, and without completely banning Japanese goods, it is not enough to develop national industries. International struggles in the twentieth century can be called economic struggles rather than military struggles. Our desire to resist Japanese goods and promote domestic goods is one reason. We all know that Japan has a small land area and a surplus of population. It regards our country's raw materials as the source of its industry and commerce and the Chinese market as the outlet for its life. Therefore, Japan fears our people's genuine resistance to goods more than the counterattack of the Northeast Volunteer Army. If the people can thoroughly realize the complete severance of relations with Japan, it will be enough to control Japan's lifeline, which is more effective than empty talk about resisting Japan. Our desire to resist Japanese goods and promote domestic goods is another reason. Since the Chinese resistance to Japanese goods movement began in 1907, there have been nine times. Every time after a resistance to goods, the sales of Japanese goods have increased instead. After the September 18th Incident, the whole country ran around and shouted, and the sound of resisting goods and checking goods filled the country. But our compatriots are forgetful. Before long, we heard that Japanese goods in Qingdao and Tianjin had increased greatly, and Japanese goods in Shanghai remained the same. This phenomenon cannot but be mourned by those who are close to us and cheered by those who are enemies. Businessmen, the danger of the country and the nation has reached this point. If the nation is subjugated, what will be left of our families? Although India is rich, it has become a British colony. Although Jews are good at managing wealth, they cannot avoid the sorrow of national subjugation. The dangerous situation of our country today is only a short distance from that. Today, all compatriots should use their conscience to love the country and save the country from their own position. If we can work together with one heart and cherish the determination to wipe out our humiliation, then the destruction of Qin by three households is not without reason. We have been greatly stimulated and vow to take the lead in saving the country and resisting foreign aggression. However, since we are not social producers, we can only make efforts to call and promote and prevent the best-selling Japanese goods in the Shanghai market. We rely entirely on the faithful execution of the business community. The situation is urgent and does not allow hesitation. If the country is destroyed and the family is destroyed, it is difficult to stand idly by. We dare to sincerely inform our businessmen to encourage each other to implement this purpose, build the foundation of the national economy, and seek the effectiveness of saving the country and wiping out humiliation. The country will be fortunate, and the compatriots will be fortunate. The Anti-Japanese Goods Movement Committee of the Shanghai University Student Union bows."</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Resolutely Oppose Postage Increase</p>
<p>Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce Telegram to Shanghai Chinese Associations</p>
<p>Expressing Opposition and Appealing for Vigorous Assistance</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of postage increases in Southeast Asia, it is now learned that the Ministry of Communications has decided to implement it from July 1st. A Far Eastern News Agency reporter, noting past opposition from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, visited Mr. Huang Jianzhong, a standing committee member of the Overseas Chinese United Association, yesterday afternoon. The reporter inquired about the association's attitude towards this issue and the recent expressions of overseas Chinese. Mr. Huang provided the following information:</p>
<p>Complicated Remittance Procedures</p>
<p>According to Mr. Huang, the authorities' stated reasons for the price increase are twofold: (1) the postal service's finances are affected by the gold standard in Southeast Asia; (2) the desire to suppress silver letter agencies and unify the postal system. However, the suffering of the general Chinese working class in Southeast Asia must be understood and forgiven by both the public and the government. Most of these workers are illiterate laborers with meager incomes. When they occasionally have a dozen or so yuan, they must remit it home to support their families. If they remit through the post office, they must first pay someone to write a letter, then go to the post office to pay the remittance fee, registration fee, and other fees. Before the money and letter are even sent, they have already spent about two yuan. After the money and letter arrive, the postman delivering it to the countryside demands another four or five jiao. In total, remitting a dozen or so yuan requires spending three yuan. How can the general working class afford this? Therefore, silver letter agencies have naturally emerged.</p>
<p>Letter Agencies are Very Convenient</p>
<p>Silver letter agencies are a type of commercial organization that specializes in profiting from fluctuations in silver prices. Those remitting money and letters only need to go to a silver letter agency, state where to remit, and how much silver to remit. The silver letter agency will write the letter for free and does not require any remittance fee. After the letter arrives at its destination, the agency can also write a reply for the recipient, without requiring any further fees. In total, remitting ten yuan only costs five fen in postage. This is the convenience of silver letter agencies, which is why they are popular with the general public. Silver letter agencies send letters in bundles of one hundred, each bundle with five fen in postage. If the price increases, each bundle would require twelve yuan, which would naturally be opposed by the general overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Our Association's Stance</p>
<p>The postage increase in Southeast Asia was originally intended to be implemented on April 1st. Due to strong opposition, it was postponed to May 1st. On May 1st, the Ministry of Communications indicated a further postponement. Recently, our association sent representatives to Beijing to investigate. It was learned that the Ministry of Communications had decided to announce the implementation from July 1st. We immediately telegraphed various Chinese organizations in Southeast Asia and sent representatives to Xiamen, Shantou, and other places to report to the local guilds of silver letter agencies. As a Chinese organization, our association should naturally seek the welfare of overseas Chinese. Regarding the postage increase in Southeast Asia, we will adopt a unified stance with overseas Chinese organizations and consistently express our opposition.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Unanimously Oppose</p>
<p>Since receiving our association's report, Chinese organizations at home and abroad have sent letters and telegrams to our association, expressing their resolute opposition and appealing for assistance. We recently received a telegram from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Immediately, the telegram was retrieved and shown to the reporter, and is recorded as follows: (The first part omitted) "Your telegram of the fifth (May) received. If postage increases, the burden on overseas Chinese will increase, and the livelihoods of their families will be difficult to support. We have telegraphed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Communications, requesting consideration of the difficulties faced by overseas Chinese and approval to postpone the increase. Your association's concern for fellow overseas Chinese and call for vigorous assistance is greatly appreciated."</p>
<h3>Lian An Company's Taizhou Steamer</h3>
<p>Robbed by Pirates Outside Haimen</p>
<p>Three Killed, Including a Water Police Officer; Three Passengers Injured</p>
<p>Entire Ship Looted; Two People Kidnapped Before Departure</p>
<p>Heavy Losses; Company Sends Telegram Demanding Strict Capture of Pirates</p>
<p>The Taizhou steamer, owned by the Taizhou Xinji Shipping Bureau and operated by Lian An Navigation Company on the Wenzhou-Taizhou route, was scheduled to sail from Haimen to Shanghai on the evening of the 24th of this month. Outside Haimen, in the waters of Nanbei Ze, it was robbed by pirates. Two water police officers and one female passenger were killed, two passengers and one cabin boy were injured, and two passengers were kidnapped. The losses amounted to over 20,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pirates Infiltrated</p>
<p>Lian An Company owns six steamships: Zhoushan, Daxing, Chuanshan, Yili, Dahua, and Taizhou, which operate between Shanghai, Dinghai, Haimen, and Shipu. The Taizhou steamer, with a tonnage of 1,200 tons, is owned by the Taizhou Shipping Company. On Wednesday, the 24th of this month, at 6:00 PM, it set sail from Haimen fully loaded with passengers and cargo, bound for Shanghai. Eleven pirates had infiltrated among the passengers. At 8:00 PM, when the ship reached the waters of Nanbei Ze outside Haimen, fifteen li from Haimen, the infiltrated pirates, each armed with guns, first ordered the captain, Mr. Xu, and the chief mate to steer the ship between Langqi Mountain and Dachen Mountain.</p>
<p>Passengers Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Two armed water police officers from the Dinghai Water Police Bureau were traveling to Haimen on official business and were on the Taizhou steamer returning to Dinghai. The infiltrated pirates, fearing resistance from the water police, took them by surprise and fired wildly. The water police officers were immediately killed. At the same time, three passengers and one cabin boy were wounded by stray bullets. Among the passengers, a thirteen-year-old girl from Haimen returning to Shipu was seriously injured and died immediately. The ship fell into chaos, and the pirates began to loot.</p>
<p>Everything Looted</p>
<p>The Taizhou steamer was forced by the pirates to sail to the waters between Langqi Mountain and Dachen Mountain, a den of thieves. The pirates then ordered the ship to anchor. More than ten pirate ships, all carrying pirates, swarmed aboard and looted at will, numerous times. Passengers and crew members had their personal belongings, clothing, and silver dollars stolen, down to their shoes and socks. Passengers who refused to obey were beaten. The pirates were extremely brutal.</p>
<p>People Kidnapped Before Departure</p>
<p>The pirates looted the steamer for as long as twenty-four hours. After everything of value had been taken, the crew and passengers, wearing only single layers of clothing and barefoot, were sent to small boats, to be returned to the pirates' den, between Langqi Mountain and Dachen Mountain. Before leaving, the pirates kidnapped two passengers. After boarding the small boats, one of the kidnapped passengers, surnamed Wang, was released. At 7:00 PM on the 25th, the Taizhou steamer finally escaped and immediately sailed back to Haimen.</p>
<p>Escaped and Returned</p>
<p>Upon returning to Haimen, the Taizhou steamer immediately sent the three injured passengers and cabin boy to the Haimen Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, their injuries were minor and not life-threatening. The bodies of the two water police officers and the female passenger who were killed were immediately reported, inspected, and collected. At the same time, the Taizhou Xinji Shipping Bureau's headquarters in Haimen was notified, and telegrams were sent to Dinghai, Shipu, and the local military and police authorities, demanding the strict capture of the pirates. After receiving the report, Zhu Daoji, a director of the headquarters, rushed back to Haimen from Dinghai to handle the matter and telegraphed the Lian An Company in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses</p>
<p>After the looting, the Taizhou steamer's accounting office reported the loss of 875.50 yuan in water transport fees and 400 yuan in passenger tickets. Over thirty merchants traveling from Haimen to Shanghai to purchase goods suffered losses of over 20,000 yuan. The losses of personal belongings, clothing, and silver dollars of the crew and passengers were impossible to calculate at the time. The Lian An Company's Zhoushan steamer arrived in Shanghai from Haimen yesterday. The captain reported the details of the Taizhou robbery.</p>
<p>Strict Capture of Pirates</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed a clerk from the Taizhou Shipping Company and crew members from the Zhoushan steamer yesterday. They said that the Taizhou steamer was unfortunately robbed by pirates, resulting in heavy losses. The Haimen headquarters has sent a telegram demanding the strict capture of the pirates. The Taizhou steamer is scheduled to sail from Haimen to Shanghai on the 31st of this month and arrive in Shanghai on the 2nd of next month.</p>

<h3>Shortening Travel Time on Two Railway Lines</h3>
<p>Train Numbers and Travel Times Changed</p>
<p>Approved by the Ministry of Railways, Effective June 1st</p>
<p>China Internal News Agency reports that the Traffic Department of the Joint Management Bureau of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, due to orders from the Bureau to shorten the travel time of express trains and in accordance with the locomotive department's regulations on the running times of various trains, has compiled the second edition of the timetable, which has been approved by the Ministry of Railways and will be implemented from June 1st of this year. All inbound trains in the table will be renumbered with even numbers, and outbound trains will be renumbered with odd numbers, to conform to the numbering methods of other state-owned railway trains and demonstrate uniformity. The revised times for each line are detailed below:</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>Shortening the Travel Time of Express Trains</p>
<p>The newly ordered special express trains, except for the fifth and sixth night special express trains, the first and fourth special express trains (i.e., the existing second and third special express trains) have had their travel times reduced to six hours and fifty minutes. Each train is limited to twelve carriages and is hauled by Pacific locomotives. The travel times of the 302nd and 301st inbound and outbound Shanghai-Beijing through express trains have also been reduced to seven hours and forty minutes and seven hours respectively. The travel time of the second inbound express train on this line has also been reduced to seven hours.</p>
<p>Adding Shanghai-Beijing Through Express Train</p>
<p>Adding the 302nd inbound Shanghai-Beijing through express train. After consultation with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway authorities, it will depart from the North Shanghai Station at 1:00 AM daily and arrive in Beijing at 8:40 AM. As the inbound night express train on that line departs earlier, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway authorities do not want through passengers to wait too long in Pukou, the departure and arrival times of this train could not be advanced further. In the future, all carriages will use the through trains organized by the various lines. However, before the ferry service between Beijing and Pukou begins, the line plans to temporarily use its own carriages, including eight first-class and second-class passenger carriages each, four third-class passenger carriages, two baggage-mail carriages, and other mail and parcel carriages, and only sell tickets for this line. Until the ferry service between Beijing and Pukou is established, this through train will use the carriages of the existing fourth express train on this line. The departure time, after consultation with the Tianjin-Pukou authorities, is scheduled to be 5:25 PM from Beijing, arriving at the North Shanghai Station at 0:25 AM the next day. At the same time, it is also limited to only selling tickets for this line. (Note) Before the Tianjin-Pukou Railway timetable is completely revised, all through passengers between Shanghai and Beijing will still be transported by the first and fourth trains (i.e., the existing second and third trains).</p>
<p>Canceling the Midday Train from Shanghai to Beijing</p>
<p>To save locomotive power, the line plans to cancel the existing 11th inbound midday express train from Shanghai to Beijing. The saved locomotives will be used to run the newly added 302nd inbound Shanghai-Beijing through express train. The cancellation of the midday express train will not cause inconvenience to passengers traveling between Shanghai and Beijing. According to the current outbound timetable, the midday express train makes more stops in the Shanghai to Zhenjiang section. After Zhenjiang, it travels directly to Nanjing without stopping along the way. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Beijing can take the 2nd inbound (i.e., the current 1st train) Shanghai-Beijing through express train, which departs from North Shanghai at 3:10 PM. Because the travel time of the express train has been shortened, the arrival time in Beijing is almost the same as the original midday express train.</p>
<p>Extending the Shanghai-Changzhou Service to Zhenjiang</p>
<p>After the cancellation of the 11th inbound midday express train from Shanghai to Beijing, to compensate for the convenience of passengers at stations in the Shanghai to Zhenjiang section, it has been decided to extend the Shanghai-Changzhou service to Zhenjiang, changing it to the Shanghai-Zhenjiang service. This service is scheduled to depart from North Shanghai Station at 12:15 PM and arrive at Zhenjiang Station at 8:10 PM. In this case, passengers on the existing 11th express train can take this service. Although the midday express train is canceled, it will not be affected. The existing 22nd outbound Changzhou-Shanghai service will be changed to the 21st outbound Zhenjiang-Shanghai service, departing from Zhenjiang Station. The purpose is to reduce congestion on the 7th outbound Beijing-Shanghai early express train (i.e., the current 10th train). It is scheduled to depart from Zhenjiang Station at 7:05 AM and arrive at North Shanghai Station at 3:00 PM. (Note) The above-mentioned Zhenjiang-Shanghai service is a measure to consider the convenience of passengers. However, before the facilities at Zhenjiang Station are completed, the locomotives used for the Zhenjiang-Shanghai service must travel from Changzhou. After the locomotives for the Shanghai-Zhenjiang service arrive in Zhenjiang, they must return to Changzhou. During these return trips, the locomotives will inevitably travel in reverse, so it must be handled according to regulations, limiting the speed to 40 kilometers per hour. The Traffic Department is currently seeking instructions from the Administration on this point. The existing 4th outbound Beijing-Shanghai express train will be changed to the 301st through train in the future. Its departure time from Beijing must be delayed to 5:25 PM. To facilitate passengers traveling from Beijing to stations in the Wuxi section, it is planned to advance the existing Beijing-Wuxi service to 2:00 PM, departing from Beijing. Passengers traveling from Beijing to stations in the Zhenjiang section, if they feel that the departure time from Beijing is too early, can take the recently added 25th outbound (i.e., the current 28th train) Beijing-Zhenjiang service.</p>
<p>Beijing-Zhenjiang Service Awaiting Implementation</p>
<p>The Railway Administration believes that Nanjing is the capital and Zhenjiang is the provincial capital. Although the distance is short, passenger traffic is frequent. Therefore, it has decided to add the 26th inbound and 25th outbound Zhenjiang-Beijing services to facilitate passengers. However, they will only be launched after the necessary facilities at Zhenjiang Station are completed.</p>
<p>Inbound Express Train Departure Delayed</p>
<p>The current 3rd special express train and the current 7th early express train are very close in time on the route, making overtaking possible. In the future, the travel time of the special express train must be shortened. To avoid overtaking on the route, it is planned to change the departure time of the 4th express train from North Shanghai Station to 10:00 AM daily, the same as the departure time of the 1st train from Beijing.</p>
<p>One Night Express Train in Each Direction</p>
<p>It has been decided that night express trains will only run one train in each direction. The Chief of the Locomotive Department has agreed to save locomotive power and facilitate train operation. The Chief of the Locomotive Department has also stated that there are no problems with heating equipment for the autumn and winter seasons.</p>
<h3>Songhu Line</h3>
<p>Songhu Line Adds Twelve Services</p>
<p>The Songhu Branch Line currently has a total of 28 services in both directions. In recent months, passenger traffic on the line has been improving daily. To facilitate travel, the number of services in the newly ordered timetable is planned to increase to a total of 40 in both directions. Two steam carriages and two ordinary locomotives hauling passenger carriages will be used in rotation. One of the two steam carriages is planned to be used as a backup. After this revision, it is expected that travel on the line will be greatly facilitated. The running times of freight trains have also been included in accordance with the Ministry's orders, with four services in each direction.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Line</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line Also Changed</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line has also been changed. The results of the investigation are as follows: (1) The existing 31st and 32nd inbound and outbound Shanghai-Beijing through express trains have been changed to the 2nd inbound and 1st outbound Shanghai-Beijing through express trains, consistent with the corresponding trains on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. (2) The departure time of the 37th outbound (i.e., the current 40th) third and fourth-class slow train from North Shanghai Station is planned to be advanced to 9:50 AM to avoid conflicting with the departure time of the 4th inbound (i.e., the current 3rd) train on the Beijing-Shanghai Line from North Shanghai Station. (3) The planned Huzhou-Shanghai service, due to a shortage of locomotives in the Locomotive Department, has not been restored. The existing 35th and 36th Shanghai-Huzhou express trains have the characteristics of the Huzhou-Shanghai service in the Huzhou-Shanghai section. Therefore, there is no great inconvenience in terms of travel. (4) The running times of other trains are roughly the same as the existing timetable, except for slight changes in the stops.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Donate to Comfort Song's Troops</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese in My Tho, Vietnam, through their "Reducing Food to Save the Country Association," donated 2,000 yuan, which was transferred to General Song Zheyuan by the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Patriotic Donation Collection Office to comfort the soldiers of his unit. The patriotism of the overseas Chinese is evident.</p>
<h3>Taxation Administration Changes Beer Tax Rate</h3>
<p>Changed to Specific Tax</p>
<p>Effective the 15th of Next Month</p>
<p>The General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance in this city believes that since the domestic beer manufacturing industry switched to on-site taxation in 1931, tax revenues have improved. The current tax rate is 20% ad valorem, assessed on the market price when the factory is opened. This has been in effect for a long time, but market prices fluctuate constantly, leading to many discrepancies in practice. Moreover, ad valorem pricing involves complicated procedures, and the tax amount is not always fair. To standardize taxation, the tax rate for domestically produced beer will be changed to a specific tax. Regardless of the selling price, a box of 48 large bottles (quart bottles) or 72 small bottles (pint bottles) will be taxed at 2.60 yuan. Barrel or cask beer will be taxed at 7 fen per liter of net capacity. The outside of barrels or casks should be marked with the net liters for verification. The specific tax rate will be implemented nationwide from June 15th of this year to ensure standardization.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of Land Tax for Beihui Section of County Road</h3>

The Department approved the cancellation, and the county government has ordered the Land Tax Collection Office to comply.</p>
<h3>Xu Xueyu</h3>
<p>Discusses Reasons for Telephone Price Increase</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce to Meet Today</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications increased prices, various trade associations have opposed it. The City Chamber of Commerce plans to send representatives to the Telephone Bureau to negotiate a temporary suspension of charges. Yesterday, according to an interview with Xu Xueyu, the director of the Telephone Bureau, the City Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter informing them of their plan to send representatives to the Bureau to negotiate. He has replied, inviting them to meet at the Bureau on Monday (today) morning to explain everything. As for the Bureau's financial situation, before the conversion to automatic machinery, strict austerity measures were taken to barely balance income and expenses. After the conversion, the Bureau must pay US$4,000 per month in debt, equivalent to about 20,000 yuan. There are currently only 2,530 subscribers, of which 200 have not been converted to automatic machinery and are still charged at the old rate. The newly set rates are seven yuan for residential lines and ten yuan for business lines, with a monthly income of about 21,000 yuan, which barely covers the Bureau's expenses. The US$4,000 debt and the cost of repairs and supplies still need to be raised. As for the cancellation of the concession telephone fee, the Bureau consulted with the concession company on the method of canceling the five-fen call fee when the automatic exchange was opened. The company did not agree due to excessive losses. The Bureau is still in consultation with the company to achieve this goal.</p>

Chairman of the Board Li Yuying was elected as the chairman of the meeting. First, the chairman delivered the opening address, stating that during the past year, the national crisis has become more urgent and commerce has declined, creating a special difficulty for the financial sector. The bank's main goal is to consolidate its foundation and preserve its strength. All operations are viewed in terms of their potential for development, and attention is paid to rural economic issues in the spirit of its name. Although the past year has been extremely difficult, all operations have developed, and the profits are better than last year. This is comforting to the shareholders. The operating situation will be reported in detail by the general manager and need not be repeated here. One matter is important to our bank and should be reported to everyone. General Manager Yao Kui has resigned from his positions as general manager and director due to illness. His intention is firm. The fourth meeting of the third board of directors approved his resignation from the position of general manager, but he will remain as a director. Associate Manager Qi Zhi was appointed as general manager and will also serve as the manager of the Shanghai branch. The center of office operations at the general office will be shifted from the general manager system to the board of directors system. The chairman of the board, standing directors, and general manager will jointly be responsible for the affairs. Since I have been serving as chairman of the board, I have made few contributions to the bank's affairs. I am not a banking expert and feel deeply ashamed. I went abroad for eight months last year. Mr. Zhou Zuomin served as my proxy and made many contributions to the bank's affairs. This term of the board of directors, I will be going to Europe again and have suggested that Mr. Zhang Gongquan serve as acting chairman of the board. In the future, our bank will have a famous figure in the financial sector to preside over the bank's affairs, which will surely lead to daily progress. This is what I am most pleased about. Then, he reported the number of shares present, reported on the operating situation of the previous year and the settlement situation. The total number of accounts and deposits, the total number of issuances, and the number of loans and other operations all increased compared to 1931. Then, he reported on the profit distribution plan for the previous year and the method of changing the resolution to amend the charter of the previous year. Next, the supervisors were re-elected. The chairman appointed Wu Zhenxiu, Lu Hanyun, Xia Weiru, and Cheng Zhenji as ballot counters. Zhang Renjie, Wang Junyi, Xia Weiru, Wu Zhenxiu, and Nie Guoliang were elected as supervisors, and Zhu Junyong, Cai Yuankun, and Peng Jiqun were elected as alternate supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The shareholders had refreshments at will, and the meeting dispersed at 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Good News for the Industrial Sector</h3>
<p>丨Establishment of the Lianyi Chemical Engineering Office丨</p>
<p>It is widely known that the success or failure of industry depends on chemistry as its foundation. All industries are like this. It is a pity that most Chinese people view this knowledge with indifference, leading to domestic products not being able to compete with foreign goods, which is truly regrettable. Recently, prominent figures in the field of chemistry, feeling the needs of the outside world, have specially hired Chinese and Western chemical technicians to organize the "Lianyi Chemical Engineering Office" at 54 Nanjing Road to serve our industrial sector. They will use the strengths of various experts to solve all chemical industrial problems. It is said that several people from the industrial sector go to consult every day.</p>

<h3>Tragic Incident at Xiang Stage on Tianbao Road, Zhabei Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than Twenty People Trampled to Death or Injured</p>
<p>Dragon Boat Festival Performance of "Legend of the White Snake"</p>
<p>Refinery Suddenly Catches Fire</p>
<p>Spectators Flee in Panic</p>
<p>Police Suppress and Hospitals Treat the Wounded</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at about 1:50 PM, a tragic incident occurred at the Xiang Stage on Tianbao Road, Zhabei, with more than twenty people killed or injured. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Watching a Play on the Dragon Boat Festival The Xiang Stage is located at the intersection of Tianbao Road and Xiangyan Bridge in Zhabei, specializing in performing Huaiyang opera. Therefore, the people who come to enjoy the opera on weekdays are mostly residents of Jiangsu and Anhui. The ticket prices are very cheap, so people flock to it, and the business is quite good. Yesterday was the abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival, and all factories and other places were closed for the holiday. The workers nearby took this opportunity to go out for leisure. At the same time, the Xiang Stage was performing the timely play "Legend of the White Snake." As a result, a group of nearby residents, both old and young, went to watch the play. The upper and lower floors were immediately full.</p>
<p>False Rumor of Electrocution Unexpectedly, not long after the performance started, a fire suddenly broke out in the machine room of the China Refining Company at No. 10 Hengxingfang, Zhangjia Lane, at the end of Ping Road behind the stage. The nearby residents were panicked. At the same time, the police on duty went out to blow whistles to warn the public. The sound was heard inside the theater. One or two well-meaning spectators rushed out to investigate. They saw white smoke billowing outside the door and thought that there was an electrocution in the theater. They hurriedly went inside to call out their companions. When other spectators saw the panicked state of these people, they asked what was happening. Under the false rumor,</p>
<h3>Inauguration Ceremony of the Sujia Highway</h3>
<p>丨Held in Suzhou on June 19丨</p>
<p>Dong Xiujia, the director of Jiangsu Construction, in order to strive for the transportation between Suzhou and Jiaxing and to revitalize the market in Jiaxing, once consulted with the Zhejiang Construction authorities on the planning of the Sujia Highway. The construction departments of the two provinces also sent special commissioners to jointly inspect and build the route and carry out the steps. It was decided that the route would start from Suzhou, pass through Beiju, Pingwang, Wangjiangjing, and other places, and go directly to Jiaxing in Zhejiang. The required funds were jointly borne by the construction departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. This project, which is 77.7 kilometers long, started construction in 1921. According to the original plan, it could be completed by June last year. However, since the January 28th Shanghai War, the construction project was suspended, and the road that had already taken shape was damaged by Japanese aircraft bombing, causing particularly severe damage. Last year, when Finance Minister Song Ziwen convened the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Three Provinces Highway Conference in Nanjing, he personally instructed the construction directors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to quickly complete the Sujia Highway to facilitate transportation between the two provinces. The original route was re-planned and changed to start from Suzhou, passing through Pingwang, Jingduan City, Shengze, Wangjiangjing, and then to Jiaxing, and construction was continued. According to reconnaissance reports, the project has now completed 80% of the work. A total of 18 bridges and 8 culverts have been completed. It is expected that the entire project will be completed within the next week or so. The Sujia Highway Engineering Office will also be abolished to close the project. It is also heard that the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have decided to hold an inauguration ceremony in Suzhou on June 18. At that time, groups from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will be invited to send representatives to set off by car to inspect the entire highway project.</p>
<p>Spreading throughout the Theater, the spectators on the upper floor also rushed to leave their seats and escape towards the stairs.</p>
<p>Crowded Stairs Unfortunately, the stairs were narrow and there were too many people. At the same time, the entrance was blocked by the spectators downstairs, making it impossible to escape. However, those behind continued to push forward. As a result, more than twenty people standing on the steps fell down the stairs, but those behind were still trying their best to push forward. Thus, more than twenty people who fell on the steps were trampled on by the crowd. The screams were unbearable to hear. After receiving the report, the third squadron of the fifth district urgently dispatched all the police to suppress the crowd and tried their best to disperse them. At the same time, they cooperated with the fire brigade to put out the fire in the refinery company.</p>
<p>Names of the Seriously Injured In about half an hour, the fire was completely extinguished. At the same time, the police officers at the Xiang Stage carried out the injured separately. Among them, twelve had been trampled to death. They were sent to Tongren and Guangren hospitals in fire trucks. There were five injured males: (1) Yin A Gen, 32 years old, from Ningbo, left hand, (2) Wu Jinwei, 15 years old, from Jiangbei, head, (3) Zhang Su, 26 years old, from Jiangbei, abdomen, (4) Yuan Zhengjin, 14 years old, from Jiangbei, brain, (5) Unnamed, about 20 years old, very slight abdominal injury. There were four females, among whom, apart from one woman, the remaining three were all girls. Currently, there are seven people with minor injuries in Guangren Hospital, namely: Li Dekui, 14 years old, from Jiangbei, Wei Gentaozi, 10 years old, from Jiangbei, Zhang Guiyao, 11 years old, from Shaoxing, Zhang Quanfu, 15 years old, from Shaoxing, Shi Fumin, 14 years old, from Haimen, Qian Cuxian, 21 years old, from Ningbo, and Zhang Kuanquan, 11 years old, from Hangzhou. They are currently being treated at Tongren Hospital.</p>
<p>Twelve Dead A total of twelve people were trampled to death by the crowd, all with blood on their faces. The scene was too horrible to bear. Currently, the corpses have been carried to the open space there by the third squadron of the fifth district, and the local court has been requested to send personnel to verify the deaths. At the same time, an investigation into the families of the deceased will be conducted. By 9 PM, all of the deceased had been identified by their families. Among them, eight were males: Han Gendi, 12 years old, and Han Liuzhizi, 5 years old, both from Funing, Chen Jinsong, 17 years old, from Nanxiang, Yin Yunde, 8 years old, from Ningbo, Zhao Xiaosanzi, 16 years old, and Zhao Xiaowuzi, 13 years old, both from Baoying, Xu Miaogen, 7 years old, from Ningbo, and one unidentified male corpse.

<h3>On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, a Car Crashes into the Corner of a House</h3>
<p>One Killed, Four Injured</p>
<p>The Driver Flees</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, merchants and businessmen in Shanghai often take cars from Shanghai to Hangzhou for sightseeing. As a result, cars come and go endlessly on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and accidents often occur. The day before yesterday afternoon, a car with license plate number 5458 from the Shanghai Public Works Bureau and license plate number 8396 from the Concession, owned by a certain Mr. Shuang, was carrying four passengers and was returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou. When the car drove to the Jinshanwei Station area of Fengxian County, the driver accidentally veered the car, causing the front of the car to crash into the corner of the station, injuring five villagers. One of them, Chen Yinquan, died instantly due to injuries to vital areas. The station staff detained the car and summoned the police to take the four passengers in the car, along with the car, to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The four injured villagers were put on a public bus and taken to Shanghai for hospital treatment. The driver of the car, seeing that an accident had occurred, took advantage of the crowd's commotion and fled without a trace. The body of the villager Chen Yinquan who was killed was reported by the local bailiff to the Fengxian County Government for verification.</p>
<h3>A Gruesomely Murdered Male Corpse Discovered on Beile Road in the Dim Light of Night</h3>
<p>A Total of Thirty-One Knife and Axe Wounds All Over the Body</p>
<p>No Family Members Found, Awaiting Hospital Verification Today</p>
<p>At 2:15 AM yesterday, two Chinese detectives, No. 533 and No. 700, from the Lou Ka Wan Central Police Station in the French Concession, were patrolling the south side of the road about ten zhang west of the western end of Beile Road, Kang Ti Road, in front of the gate of No. 331. They discovered an unidentified man lying face up on the sidewalk, head facing east and feet facing west. They called out to him, but he did not respond. They kicked him, but he did not move. When they leaned down to inspect, he had already died. His face was covered in blood, and he had been hacked to death with a knife. They moved the corpse to that location. One detective watched over the corpse, while the other rushed back to the Central Police Station to report. The head detective sent investigators to inspect the scene. It was found that the corpse was short in stature, wearing a striped Yuan Se serge long gown, with a vest underneath, Western-style single trousers, and small round-toed serge shoes, with black rubber galoshes on the outside. Upon detailed inspection, the corpse had a total of twenty-two or three large wounds from being hacked, and seven or eight small wounds from being stabbed with a knife, from head to toe and on both arms. The left leg was broken and stacked on top of the right leg. The clothes were completely torn. The corpse had red and green tattoos on both arms, and a strongman dancing with immortals carrying flowers tattooed on its chest. Two gold teeth were inlaid in the upper part of the mouth. The scene was too horrible to bear. Most of the bloodstains on the ground had been washed away by the rain, and the remaining bloodstains were already blurred. According to the detectives' speculation, the deceased was likely lured to the location and hacked to death. A murder weapon, an axe, was found about one storefront to the west of the location where the corpse was found. The detective took it back to the police station and reported to the head detective, who notified the Fuyuan branch, ordering the undertaker to go to the autopsy room to transport the corpse. No family members were found. The Second Special District Court will be requested to send personnel to verify the corpse today. At the same time, Western detective Fu Yu notified detectives in the Western section, both Chinese and Western, to pay attention to strictly apprehending the murderer and bringing him to justice.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Commits Suicide by Drowning Out of Indignation at National Affairs</h3>
<p>Fifty-Word Suicide Note</p>
<p>Warned by the Authorities</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Xin Jiangtian (Shanghai-Ningbo route) ship, which was fully loaded with passengers, departed from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 24th and arrived at the mouth of Zhenhai at 4:30 AM the next morning, the 25th, about to enter the port. A third-class passenger surnamed Zhang, 22 years old, from Hunan, who was an employee of a foreign company in Shanghai, felt disgusted and harbored the thought of ending his life. He sneaked to the deck and jumped into the sea, taking advantage of the unpreparedness of others. The sailors on the ship noticed and stopped the ship to rescue him. However, the sky was not yet bright, and the waves were rough. They watched as the young man was swept away by the huge waves, and there was no way to save him. Afterwards, the steward of the ship found a suicide note in his berth, which read: "Japanese bandits are invading our territory, and the state affairs are deteriorating. Rather than becoming a subjugated slave in the future, why not throw myself into the Qing stream now and end this broken body. I hope that all the honorable gentlemen will quickly rise up and rejuvenate the country, and save the people, which is also to save the country." It was signed with the surname Zhang.</p>
<h3>Lost Girl Picked Up</h3>
<p>A police officer of the second squadron of the Public Security Bureau found a lost girl, Zhang Xiaoer, near the Sanwan Factory in Lujiazai, Pudong, the day before yesterday evening and sent her to the third district. According to Zhang, she is 15 years old and from Taixing. She lost her mother at a young age. Last year, she came to Shanghai with her father and was sent to work at the Gongda Cotton Mill. Recently, the factory has been reducing female workers due to poor business. I was also laid off this time and have no place to live.

<h3>He Fangpu Still Not Released</h3>
<p>Arrest Was Carried Out Under Orders from Nanchang</p>
<p>He Zireng Still Related to Mitsui &amp; Co.</p>
<p>He Fangpu, former compradore of Mitsui &amp; Co., was arrested by the Zhejiang Special Task Force upon returning to his hometown of Xieqiao, Haining, and taken to the Hangzhou Provincial Public Security Bureau for questioning. The Shanghai Municipal General Assembly, the Haichang Guild, and other organizations have requested his release due to their professional and hometown connections, but he has not yet been released. It is reported that the Zhejiang authorities carried out the arrest under orders from Nanchang, indicating a very serious situation. He was arrested just two hours after returning to Xieqiao. After being taken to Hangzhou, he was interrogated twice. He admitted to having worked for Mitsui but claimed to have left the company. However, investigations revealed that although He no longer has a direct employer-employee relationship with Mitsui, his former position is now held by his eldest son, so it cannot be said that there is absolutely no connection. Furthermore, He reportedly took the opportunity to purchase Japanese sugar in bulk with each shipment, earning substantial profits. Therefore, his release will not be easy. It is also heard that party officials in Haining, upon learning of He's arrest, have requested strict punishment, considering He to be a treacherous merchant.</p>
<h3>Reader's Advisor</h3>
<p>On the Question of How to Read Books</p>
<p>| Reply to Mr. Wen from Yangzhou |</p>
<p>Answer: I have read your letter and the draft reading plan carefully. Based on my limited knowledge, I would like to offer my humble opinions on both the letter and the plan, hoping they may be of some use to you.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding your letter: You mentioned, "My studies in politics and economics are based on past learning, but during my university years, I lacked a proper method of reading, so despite years of diligent study, my gains were superficial." While this may be your modest assessment, it also reflects a general truth. However, our criticism of current university education goes beyond this. In our view, university students today suffer not just from "lacking a proper method of reading" or "superficiality." Because university education is fundamentally aimed at teaching students the path to pursuing advanced knowledge, that is, the so-called method, rather than simply providing answers. As for "superficiality," it is not a major problem for university students. In reality, universities in so-called civilized countries primarily teach officially sanctioned science, especially social science, which is often merely a defense of the interests of a few and cannot satisfy our pursuit of truth. One cannot find many economists or sociologists in universities in Europe, America, or Japan who truly fight for the majority of the people. If you are going to study in Japan for convenience of reference, it's a good plan, but if you want to study politics and economics at a university there, it's really not necessary. That's one point. In our opinion, to study politics and economics, if you have the necessary background, you can simply buy more reference books in China and that would be enough. Moreover, the study of politics and economics must be done in the daily struggles of social life and political life, not something that can be bought by spending a lot of tuition abroad. Even if you could buy it, it would be a "silver-like wax spearhead." That's the second point. So now, we want to ask you to consider:</p>
<p>(1) Why do you want to study politics and economics?</p>
<p>(2) For whose benefit are you studying politics and economics?</p>
<p>If you say you are pursuing knowledge for the sake of knowledge, or seeking knowledge to fill your own emptiness, then that is deceitful talk. If you say you are studying politics and economics to solve the problems of China and even the world, then you must first decide whether your research is based on the interests of individuals or a few. Once this is decided, your perspective will naturally be extremely clear, and your research methods and materials, even your observations of the same phenomena and materials, will be extraordinarily different. That's the third point.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding your draft reading plan: Now, no matter what science you study, foreign languages are very important. Without preparation in at least two foreign languages, you can't even be considered a researcher. Your plan to improve your foreign languages is correct. That's the first point. The subjects listed in the first stage should all be studied, so there is naturally no problem. The only question is which school of economics, political science, sociology, etc., you will base your research on... or whether you will study all schools and then settle on one. For example, when it comes to principles of economics, there are capitalist principles of economics and socialist principles of economics, and within socialism, there is a distinction between utopian socialist economics and scientific socialist economics. If you are not careful about these paths and start down the wrong road, you will be wrong from then on. That's the second point. In our opinion, the second stage should be as follows:</p>
<p>Second Stage: General Study of Specialized Problems:</p>
<p>(1) The Relationship between Economic Systems and Social Organizations;</p>
<p>(2) The Relationship between Rural Economy and Rural Society;</p>
<p>(3) The Relationship between Land Issues, Tax Policies, and Class;</p>
<p>(4) The Relationship between Population Issues and Production Relations, Productivity, and Production Methods;</p>
<p>(5) The Relationship between International Economics and Weak Nations;</p>
<p>(6) The Relationship between Labor Issues and Factory Management;</p>
<p>(7) The Relationship between Local Governments and Municipal Issues;</p>
<p>The so-called "system" is the written expression of an organization, and the so-called "economic system" is the written expression of an "economic organization." Studying the economic system is studying its organization; the object is one, not two. However, when we say study the relationship between the economic system and social organizations, the meaning is completely different, and at the same time, in terms of academic study, there is a scientific and historical connection. Also, while the population problem is related to the food problem, the laws of this population problem are not constant from ancient times to the present, but each era has its own special population laws. As for the current population problem (in capitalist and socialist societies), it is more closely related to "production relations, productivity, and production methods" than to food. As for the issue of "local autonomy," in reality, it is the issue of local government, that is, which group of people leads this local autonomy, and consequently, municipal issues will also be different. We believe the third stage should be: Central Study of Specialized Problems:</p>
<p>(1) The Relationship between China's Population Problem and International Economic Problems (the economy of imperialism and the economy of socialism).</p>
<p>(2) The Prospects and Inevitable Fate of Solving China's Population Problem and the Rationalization of its Economic Organization.</p>
<p>(3) The Aufhebung of the Opposition between City and Countryside. The term Aufhebung means eliminating their opposition and fusing their strengths into one. Some translate it as "sublation" or "annihilation," but we think a transliteration is better.</p>
<p>(4) The Fundamental Solution to China's Land Problem. (Since there is already item (1) in the previous section, there is no need to talk about rural construction again, because the opposition between rural and urban areas will be eliminated in the future.)</p>
<p>If this kind of reading plan can be implemented, then whether you are sightseeing in various parts of Japan, giving research reports, or translating or introducing famous works, it will all be possible. As for the three things to pay attention to during your three years in Japan, they are certainly important, but we believe "C" should be the first item, because only after deeply understanding the economic, political, and social situation of Japan can you truly recognize the Japanese people and their national character, and can you recognize the reasons for the success of the Meiji Restoration. As for seeking a "rational solution to the China-Japan problem," you must have a clear understanding of world history and the international situation, as well as the complex relationship between class and nation. Simply observing Japan will not find this rational solution, and even thinking only from the perspective of China itself, or even only from the interests of a few, will not find this solution.</p>
<p>Travel to India, Soviet Russia, and Denmark is necessary, but we want to ask why you only want to investigate India? Why only investigate Denmark? Shouldn't the United States be investigated? Shouldn't Hitler's Germany be investigated? Shouldn't Annam be investigated? As for your "specialized writings and publications" upon your return from studying abroad, of course, we who yearn to solve social problems eagerly wish for their early arrival. However, we have one request: please don't give us, these hopelessly weak "A Dou"s, any more "Shangri-La" fantasies, and don't use the illusions played by a few foreigners to preach "love for the countryside" or "urban hypocrisy" to us, these "near-death hearts that cannot be revived" weaklings! This is what we hope for from you! "Do not tell outsiders!"</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Medicine and Pharmacy in Shanghai in the Last Decade (Continued)</h3>
<p>—Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 4: The Situation of Business</p>
<p>The business of traditional doctors and traditional Chinese medicine merchants. From a general and sweeping perspective. People assume that it will be crowded out by new medicine. And fall into a state of decline. However, in Shanghai in the last ten years. It can be said that the business of traditional medicine and drugs is in its heyday. Why is that? Because the new trends are surging fiercely. Invisibly aroused the struggle of traditional medicine and drugs. The result of the struggle. On the contrary, there is a temporary vigorous phenomenon. But business only cares about being prosperous. And the theory does not restore the ancient times. Just look at many old doctors. Full of new terms. Such as the words "meningitis." and "cystitis". Holding a thermometer in his hand. What "high three points and drop four points" are studied. Nat. Cacodylate is prepared in the diagnosis to give people some shots. When encountering an acute illness. Be sure to ask the patient to invite a Western doctor to give a shot to strengthen the heart. Or use the efficacy of serum. While maintaining the reputation of the ancestral throat department. Even opened a Chinese medicine hospital. To move people's attention. All of this. Which one is not an ancient innovation. A blatant expression of struggle. Fortunately, the social people are a little hesitant. Using the old method. It seems that there is no enjoyment of modern civilization. Use a brand-new method. And I have never had such courage. So there is a need for this struggling-style contemporary doctor. And the contemporary doctor's business is naturally developed. Therefore, some people say 丨The prosperity of traditional medicine and drugs today. It is a fluctuating prosperity. The market is a prosperity of non-adherence. The above-mentioned several actions. Fully show the use of thermometers. The occurrence of new disease types. The efficacy of strengthening heart needles and diphtheria serum. They have all silently recognized it as accurate. But I just don’t want to praise it. This struggle will eventually be assimilated. But it’s an excellent phenomenon. correct. In the past, Japan changed from traditional Chinese medicine to scientific medicine. There is also this transitional stage. However, their government orders are good. Under a unified medical system. Even if you refer to the old method. The government only regards you as new. Therefore, Japanese medicine has. Today, there is such a day. It's ridiculous that we Chinese. But play what the National Medical Center is. I am afraid that its academic system will be chaotic. In fact, traditional doctors have two very different expectations for the National Medical Center. There is a most conservative old doctor. Of course, I hope to study ancient methods. Preserve the quintessence of the country. (This old doctor has been practicing medicine and still follows the old methods and will never be wrong.) And most of the old doctors. And the big guys who seem only semi-knowledgeable. I don’t want to refer to the new method. Specialize in making transitional doctors. To adapt to a transitional society. The mentality of this kind of person. Simply hoping that everything in China. Always wandering in the middle. But not crossing. result. The most conservative old school. Was used by this group for a while. And it was still crowded out.</p>
<p>Between Guangxu and Xuantong in the former Qing Dynasty. New schools were booming everywhere. A group of elderly people. With ridiculous eyes. I am afraid that no one will be able to write calligraphy, poetry, and ancient prose in the future. So I opened several ancient schools. Now those ancient schools. Has not existed for many years. However, in the past twenty years, poetry, lyrics, and songs. Although not enough to establish a country. There is no complete silence. And those who are capable are from ancient schools. The oldest faction of the National Medical Center. Looking at this example. You can also realize it.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu Ziwei's Will for Anatomical Dissection, A Respectful Announcement to the Public (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Yun Xiu</p>
<p>Pathological anatomy is one of the most important aspects of medical science. Without it, practical medicine cannot advance. For example, the disease commonly called "stroke" in our country is understood as cerebral hemorrhage thanks to the practice of dissection in Western countries. Not only doctors but even laymen know this because they have seen and heard so much about pathological dissections of strokes. If not for this work, we would probably still be hearing from our esteemed Chinese doctors about "external strokes," "internal strokes," strokes affecting "meridians," "collaterals," "viscera," and "fu organs," with the causes attributed to "fire," "qi," or "dampness," leading to a cacophony of theories and confusion, leaving everyone bewildered. This is because they have not seen the actual pathological picture of stroke through dissection, so they just talk nonsense without anyone questioning them. Furthermore, the general public has never heard of pathological anatomy or seen the actual pathological picture of stroke as cerebral hemorrhage, so these doctors can easily deceive them with their ghost stories. This is a clear and obvious fact.</p>
<p>Cholera, a contagious disease, is not the same as the "wet cholera" that old Chinese doctors before the Daoguang era of the Qing dynasty described as "killing few people." It was Koch who discovered it in Egypt while studying the disease. He performed pathological dissections on cholera patients and discovered changes in the intestines, including comma-shaped bacteria in the small intestine. Later, he went to other places where cholera was rampant and performed pathological dissections on many cholera corpses to confirm that the comma-shaped bacteria were indeed the pathogens of epidemic cholera. Now,</p>
<p>we use these comma-shaped bacteria to create a solution for preventive injections, and its effectiveness has been recognized worldwide. Last year, cholera was raging fiercely, but Shanghai had relatively few cases and deaths. This is due to the strict implementation of preventive injections. The comma-shaped bacteria solution has saved countless lives, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. If the Egyptians had not been willing to sacrifice their corpses, Koch would not have been able to perform so many pathological dissections, and he might not have discovered the comma-shaped bacteria or confirmed that they were the pathogens of cholera. Then, of course, there would be no preventive injection and no proactive epidemic prevention work. To this day, we might still be relying on Taoist rituals and deity worship as preventive measures. This is another clear and obvious fact.</p>
<p>From the first fact, we can understand that without pathological anatomy, we will never understand the true nature of diseases. Before pathological anatomy was practiced, people around the world who died from illnesses had no idea what had killed them, truly "dying without knowing why!" Let me give you two examples. The first is Mr. Xu, a wealthy merchant from Ningbo. Mr. Xu suffered from a stomach ailment, and I was called to examine him. His symptoms were frequent vomiting, stomach pain, and the vomited stomach contents had a sour taste, often with blood, resembling coffee grounds, and with abnormal fermentation and putrid odor. I diagnosed stomach cancer, but many other doctors said it was not cancer. Their reason was that there was hydrochloric acid in the stomach, and his skin color was not very pale (cachexia). Later, X-rays showed that the stomach was smooth and round, without any unevenness. The X-ray specialist said, "Definitely not stomach cancer." I saw the X-ray picture of the stomach and found it strange, but I couldn't see anything below the pylorus, so I said, "We still can't rely on the area below the pylorus." But I was also suspicious, perhaps my diagnosis was wrong. Later, the pyloric stenosis became more severe, completely blocked. I had no choice but to consult renowned foreign surgical experts for surgery. Who knew that upon opening the abdomen, almost all of the intestinal tract below the pylorus was cancerous, making it impossible to operate. He died a few days later. When I heard the news, I finally understood. Mr. Xu's cancer was not in the stomach, so the stomach X-ray was smooth and without bumps, and the secretion of hydrochloric acid was not completely absent. As for the lack of cachexia, it was because Mr. Xu was well-cared for, and cachexia is not the only evidence for cancer diagnosis. Later, on the day of the funeral, I went to pay my respects. Mr. Xu's eldest son asked me, "If we hadn't had surgery, wouldn't he have died so quickly?" I said, "According to the diagnosis after the surgery, it was indeed cancer and had spread beyond control. Your father's condition was hopeless. Even without surgery, it would only have prolonged his suffering for twenty or thirty days. What good would that do? In my opinion, it was fortunate that he had surgery. Now we know that there was no hope for your father's illness, and you have done your best as a son. We understand the nature of the illness thoroughly. Otherwise, after he died, there would still be many doubts and regrets, thinking that some method might have saved him, or that some other doctor might have been better. And we doctors would still be puzzled about whether it was cancer or not. Now we have solid evidence, and doubts can be dispelled. Not only does the deceased know that his fate was sealed, but his children and friends also understand that it was an incurable disease, which can reduce some of the sorrow." I said these words, and Mr. Xu's eldest son nodded, seeming to accept them. In fact, my words were the truth. How many of our countrymen die without knowing why! After they die, there is still much discussion and blame. The unfortunate doctors are criticized by the family for the medicine being too hot or the prescription too aggressive, or the needle too sharp, causing endless disputes and confusion. Once the coffin is sealed and buried, this injustice will never be redressed. In our country, I encounter these cases not just in a year, but in a month, in a day. Without solid evidence to show them, the doctors who made the wrong diagnosis will never know their mistake, and no one will prove the accuracy of the doctors who made the right diagnosis. No wonder the doctors call out "fire," "dampness," "spirit," and "phlegm" randomly, and the old women talk nonsense about "ghosts," "gods," "foxes," and "wild cats." Because there is no thorough investigation, there is chaos. In Mr. Xu's case, I feel that the doctors who examined him learned many valuable lessons. Even my initial thought that it was cancer almost wavered and I couldn't hold my ground. I also learned a lot and am very grateful. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Collecting "Sanitary Fines"</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>▲▲…………▲▲</p>
<p>It is said, "The people can be made to follow a path, but they cannot be made to understand it." This is because among the common people, there are both good and bad, with differences in knowledge and variations in morality. Fathers and sons are not the same, and husbands and wives are not equal. The establishment of laws is to remedy the shortcomings of etiquette and education. The masses of the people lack education and only know their own interests. They do not care about committing wrongdoing or breaking the law. They regard public rules as unimportant. If there is no legal restraint, they will become increasingly reckless and not know where to stop. "Guiding them with virtue" is not as effective as "disciplining them with punishment." Although this is criticized by ancient Confucian scholars as deviating from the path of kings and condemned by modern scholars as undermining civil rights, I believe that when the people's intelligence is not fully developed and education is not widespread, when the boundaries of rights and the scope of freedom are not clear, the words of the Legalists cannot be completely abandoned. Excess and deficiency both deviate from the golden mean. Laws are meant to protect the freedom of the people, and their effectiveness depends on the way they are used. Based on this principle, regarding sanitation, my suggestions are as follows:</p>
<p>China's attention to sanitation administration has been lacking for a long time. Since the national government established its capital, it has gradually become aware of this and has set up departments in the central government and bureaus in various cities to manage it. However, after several years, the results have not been obvious. When discussing sanitation, one cannot help but sigh deeply. The level of sanitation knowledge among the people is also extremely low. Although doctors like us are involved in this, newspapers have medical supplements, and magazines have specialized</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>articles, we have used up our pens and ink in writing and exhausted our mouths and tongues in persuading, but the speakers are earnest and the listeners are indifferent. These two achievements make us blush with shame! Examining the wise teachings of the past and verifying them with the current facts, we know that the foolish people cannot be reasoned with, and that good laws do not harm the harmony of nature. Empty words are of no use, and effective results are difficult to achieve. Legal sanctions are probably the only effective method. I briefly list three measures for the authorities to consider:</p>
<p>(1) Promulgate various sanitation laws, ordering all institutions, shops, factories, and families throughout the country to abide by them.</p>
<p>(2) Train high-level sanitation inspectors and assign them to various regions. Their duties are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Inspecting the sanitation of households.</p>
<p>(2) Investigating school sanitation.</p>
<p>(3) Investigating the sanitation facilities and conditions of various institutions (such as prisons, factories, and hospitals).</p>
<p>(4) Examining prostitutes.</p>
<p>(5) Inspecting the sanitation of ships and trains.</p>
<p>(3) Train a number of sanitation police in each city or county and assign them to various districts. Their duties are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Inspecting slaughterhouses and food stores to see if there are any violations of sanitation regulations.</p>
<p>(2) Inspecting the locations of garbage and excrement to see if they comply with sanitation laws.</p>
<p>(3) Inspecting the sanitation of hotels.</p>
<p>(4) Inspecting bathhouses and barbershops.</p>
<p>(5) Inspecting pedestrians to see if they spit or defecate in public places.</p>
<p>The above are just examples, and I know I am omitting many things. However, in all things in the world, there are advantages and disadvantages. There are no unchanging rules from ancient to modern times, and there are no perfect laws. Training sanitation personnel can be effective in the short term, but the matter involves changes in scope. How can we avoid corruption? The corruption leads to blatant extortion, harming good people. Private bribery conceals wrongdoing. Is this harming the people in the name of benefiting them? The way to remedy this cannot be delayed. To summarize, there are three items:</p>
<p>(1) Promote moral education to train their character.</p>
<p>(2) Allow accusations to expose their conspiracies.</p>
<p>(3) Organize a supervisory team to monitor their actions.</p>
<p>The procedure for punishing unsanitary conditions is generally carried out in two parts. Those who violate sanitation laws are first persuaded or warned. If they do not listen, they are fined to serve as a warning. The proceeds from the fines are used for sanitation construction and not for other purposes. Imposing penalties while collecting revenue is beneficial to the country and the people. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone? It depends on the actual practice of our sanitation authorities.</p>
<h3>Preface to "Sexual Medicine" by Scholar Qing</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>The structure of the world and the reproduction of living things all originate from sex, and all originate from desire. Mencius, when speaking of human nature, first mentioned food and sex. However, food and sex are a mixture of sexual and other desires, not purely sexual. Sex is individual, differing according to species, while desire is common, differing only in degree. Speaking of sex, satisfying hunger is the nature of birds, adapting to pasture is the nature of horses, swimming well is the nature of pigs, being difficult to tame is the nature of dragons, escaping cold and seeking warmth is the nature of fish, and never leaving the forest is the nature of bustards. The nature of things is inherently different, but none can be without the desire for beauty. Although humans are intelligent, how can they escape this? Even the Buddha, who is said to be pure in the six senses and to be neither born nor destroyed, seems to have no sex or desire. Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu, who advocated non-action, also seem to have no sex or desire. However, the eight generations of Buddha, Lao Tzu, and Zhuang Tzu could not avoid sex and desire. In the world, it is difficult to go against sex and desire. How can we expect the masses to transcend and be unique? Therefore, sex and desire come with all things, like the soul inseparable from the body. Many people have discussed sex in the past, but unfortunately, they were half-bound by etiquette and half-confined by speculation. If they touched on male and female sexual desire, they avoided speaking about it. It is said that Zhang Bi refused to answer the emperor's questions about bedroom matters, considering them obscene and unfit for the court. Even the sages and the wise were said to have married late after acquiring knowledge, which was considered impossible in the world but was recorded in the classics and passed down through the ages, becoming a beautiful story. Thus, for thousands of years, human nature has not been extinguished, flourishing in secret, and reproduction has been abundant in secret, without knowing why. Now, with the progress of science, the excavation of life, the survival of the fittest, and the rectification of bloodlines, the theories of strengthening the race and eugenics have arisen together. Scholars, seeking the source and exploring the root, have focused on the innate problem of reproduction. Therefore, to improve the race, we must first study the structure and organs of reproduction and the pathways of sexual desire, so that people can follow the rules, young people can avoid wrong paths, and those who fall into traps can know how to extricate themselves. Leaders can teach future generations. Therefore, in various countries, the departments of urology and reproduction have now become independent. However, our old moral standards still exist, and society avoids talking about it. To this day, there is still a lack of complete and specialized books. There are only a few fragmented chapters and remnants, which are not works that hit the mark. Scholar Qian Yiqing has broken his arm in this field for many years and has used his great writing skills to create this beautiful and specialized book. It first describes the structure of the reproductive organs, then the physiology and hygiene of sexual desire, and then the treatment of various diseases of the reproductive organs, concluding with eugenics. From this, we know that the author's purpose is upright and bright. However, today, the issue of eugenics is just beginning and has not yet reached the stage of practical implementation. However, informed people believe that we do not need to personally experience success to hold a sincere wish. We deeply hope that people in society and colleagues in the field will read it with the same method as reading the three hundred poems of the Book of Songs. Then Mr. Qian's work will not be in vain.</p>
<h3>Recent Preventive Medicine</h3>
<p>— Yin Ge</p>
<p>Calmette and the successful simultaneous immunization against diphtheria. There is the tuberculosis immunization invented by Professor Calmette. He also researched it at the Pasteur Institute. For example, typhoid and cholera bacteria can be killed with chemicals (i.e., placing the bacteria in a chemical solution) to create a bacterial suspension. Injecting this liquid under the skin can achieve a certain degree of immunity for preventive purposes. However, tuberculosis bacteria are different. A suspension of dead bacteria cannot be used for immunization. Therefore, the medical community believed that only live tuberculosis bacteria could be used for tuberculosis immunization. However, after many failures, everyone agreed that harmless live tuberculosis bacteria could not be found. Since Koch discovered tuberculosis bacteria, there have been no findings for fifty years. Until recently, the old professor Calmette and his student Gralla, both at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, collaborated and used a special culture medium designed by Calmette to repeatedly culture highly virulent tuberculosis bacteria. Later, the hereditary physicochemical structure of the tuberculosis bacteria changed. Calmette worked tirelessly on the culture for thirteen years, oblivious to everything else. In Europe, his homeland was in danger, and the sound of cannons could be heard far and wide. However, Calmette continued to culture bacteria and conduct research at the Pasteur Institute. Finally, he obtained tuberculosis bacteria that were non-toxic to animals and definitively proved that a special immunity to tuberculosis bacteria could be created in the animal body. This is like domesticating wild animals. After hundreds of generations, the animals lose their wild nature, become harmless to humans, and become livestock. The tuberculosis bacteria cultured by Calmette are like these harmless livestock.</p>
<p>Calmette and his student Gralla worked hard together and finally succeeded. Therefore, the bacteria were named Calmette-Gralla bacteria in their memory. The abbreviation in Western languages is BCG. B stands for bacteria, C for Calmette, and G for Gralla.</p>
<p>His experiments were very meticulous. The order was to first test on calves, then monkeys, rabbits, rats, etc., and finally humanoid apes. The scope of his research was extensive, and his intentions were very thorough. In 1922, Dr. Huerle, a pediatrician at the Paris Medical University, first tested it on newborns and confirmed that it was harmless and effective. When his experimental report was published, French women competed to have their children vaccinated. From 1924 to 1930, a total of 200,000 infants were vaccinated, and the infant mortality rate was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>This vaccination method is extremely simple. Within ten days of the infant's birth, three packets of medicine are used. Every two days, the medicine is placed in a small spoon to create two cc of BCG suspension. Thirty minutes before breastfeeding, when the stomach is empty, it is mixed with breast milk and given to the infant. This suspension has no odor, and the child can drink it without realizing it. It does not harm the stomach or intestines, and it does not cause fever. It is the same as drinking milk. Why can immunization be achieved without injection? Because the intestines of infants are the same as the intestines of young animals. The ability to pass bacteria and antitoxins is very strong. After drinking the BCG suspension, the bacteria pass through the intestinal wall and enter the infant's lymphatic vessels, circulating throughout the body and creating tuberculosis immunization. According to recent research, BCG should be vaccinated again at the end of the first year and at the end of the third year. The effectiveness is more certain. However, at this time, the intestinal wall is not as able to pass bacteria as it is in newborns, so a subcutaneous injection is used instead.</p>
<p>Smallpox has epidemic periods, but tuberculosis has the opportunity to infect at any time. It can be said to be in an epidemic period all year round. Infants have the opportunity to be infected from birth, so prevention is necessary. As for older children or adults, subcutaneous injections can be given to prevent the spread of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In France, you can buy the vaccine from the Pasteur Institute in Paris by telegram or mail. The institute sends it immediately upon receiving the letter. The mother usually mixes it with breast milk on the third, fifth, seventh, or sixth, eighth day after the child is born and has the infant drink it. The method is simple, and mothers are very happy. Calmette has also received the highest medal from the French government and is extremely honored.</p>
<p>(Editor's note) Pulmonary tuberculosis is a major enemy of mankind. Since the discovery of tuberculosis bacteria, the whole world has paid attention to its immunization methods, but very few have been effective. BCG is one of them. This method has been very effective in France, Belgium, Italy, etc. However, there are no detailed reports in the UK, Germany, and the United States. Presumably, it is still under study. Yin Ge's article introduces the latest theories in extremely simple language and is published in a special edition. We hope readers will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Scientific Ways to Preserve Life (19)</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(15) Management of the External Genitalia</p>
<p>(A) Consequences of Uncleanliness</p>
<p>After childbirth, the external genitalia of the postpartum woman become the source of lochia, mucus, blood, and other discharges. Therefore, the external genitalia, lower limbs, waist, and abdomen are inevitably soiled and difficult to clean. Even the bed linens and clothes are soiled. If one is not careful, it is easy to be attacked by fungi and dangerous changes can occur.</p>
<p>The most important consequence of uncleanliness of the external genitalia is the cause of puerperal fever. Although there are various causes of puerperal fever, the starting point is of course from uncleanliness and susceptibility to bacterial toxins. For example, the fingers of the midwife who delivers the baby are not disinfected, or the fingers of the doctor or midwife are not sufficiently disinfected. During childbirth, the midwife uses soiled instruments and makes unreasonable incisions, or the medical instruments or cotton swabs are not completely disinfected. The lochia does not stop and accumulates in the genitals. Then, the fungus directly invades the uterus. Before long, the onset of puerperal fever is announced.</p>
<p>In the past, people only knew that it was easier to get sick after childbirth than before pregnancy. Even if the postpartum woman delivered by a midwife was fortunate enough not to be cut during labor, many still died of illness after childbirth. This was because they did not fully understand the cause of puerperal fever, so they arbitrarily managed the external genitalia and recklessly ignored it. When danger occurred, they still did not understand the origin of this danger. Isn't that a joke? In this era, it is not difficult to understand this cause. Then, one should pay full attention to the external genitalia after childbirth and add thorough prevention to be happy.</p>
<p>(B) Cleaning the External Genitalia</p>
<p>The external genitalia and the surrounding area should be washed with sterilized warm water and a soft cloth or cotton swabs from the beginning of delivery. Then, sterilize with 2% carbolic acid water or 1% Lysol solution. Wash and wipe it directly from time to time during the delivery process. It is also necessary to wash and wipe this within a week after delivery. If there is a wound, you can sprinkle it with Dematoffin, etc., and then cover the external genitalia with sterilized cotton gauze. However, vaginal irrigation must be guided by a doctor or midwife. If there are no abnormal symptoms after delivery, there is no need for vaginal irrigation.</p>
<p>(C) Lacerations of the External Genitalia</p>
<p>During childbirth, the fetus passes through the vulva, and at the same time, abdominal pressure increases. The baby's head emerges naturally. If pathological changes occur, leading to prolonged labor or the baby's head being delayed, the external genitalia will be lacerated. Also, if it is a first-time mother of advanced age, the soft birth canal may become hardened. This is also a cause of lacerations of the external genitalia. If it has been lacerated, it should be disinfected immediately with minimal strength and a doctor should be requested quickly. Sutures should be performed at the site of the laceration.</p>
<h3>Scientific Studies on Cleanliness</h3>
<p>— Guo Renji</p>
<p>Our lives proceed accompanied by uncleanliness, because the human body is a manufacturing plant for uncleanliness. With every breath, we pollute the atmosphere. In an instant, our shirts become soiled. No matter how noble our lives, no one can suppress the excretion of feces and urine for even a day. Even the noses of beautiful women have mucus, ears have earwax, eyes have eye discharge, and mouths have dental plaque. We often criticize pigs for living in filth, but how can our lives surpass theirs? Our living places are also dirtied by our lives. However, we can remove the uncleanliness in our leisure time. This is the point of human superiority. If we do not care about uncleanliness at all, we are barely superior to pigs. The unclean things we produce are of no benefit to the human body. They are not only unnecessary, but they also increase unpleasantness in life, are disliked by others, and are very harmful. Therefore, we must strive to eliminate uncleanliness and must study and seek a proper method of cleanliness for the sake of the joy and beauty of life.</p>
<p>Sensory Uncleanliness Generally, when we drink water and find a grain of rice in it, we feel that the water is unclean. But in reality, is it directly harmful? Some people are so clean that they do not go to the toilet unless they are naked, and they do not pick up chopsticks unless they wash their hands three times. This is because their senses are more acute than ordinary people. Their nerves are not physiological, but pathological. We call it mysophobia. This is not a good example. The harm of mysophobia is not much different from the harm of non-mysophobia. Why is it beneficial to seek cleanliness beyond what is necessary, and to neglect important cleanliness? It is not uncommon for things that do not feel unclean to be very unclean and dangerous. It is dangerous to judge cleanliness based solely on the five senses. This is why there is a need for research on the left. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Cheng Qibao and Others Return to Beijing After Meeting Chiang</p>
<p>Statement by Mr. Cheng Regarding the Alumni Association of Jinan University</p>
<p>Five education commissioners, including Cheng Qibao, who were on a fact-finding trip to Europe, recently met with Chiang in Jiangxi and Shanxi provinces at his invitation. They returned to Beijing yesterday from Jiangxi. When interviewed by reporters at the Ministry of Education, in addition to inquiring about the details of the trip, Mr. Cheng also addressed the matter of the open letter from the Jinan University Alumni Association published in the newspapers. He stated that the content of the letter was completely inconsistent with the facts. He explained that when he and his colleagues (Cheng referring to himself) passed through Singapore, he had discussed overseas Chinese education at a welcome reception for overseas Chinese, which was well received by the overseas Chinese present. Regarding Jinan University, he only hoped for its continued development and the completion of its mission, and had absolutely no intention of slandering it. The Ministry of Education's various measures and reform plans are the responsibility of the administrative head, and have nothing to do with Cheng Qibao. In conclusion, he acknowledged that the Alumni Association's intention to protect their alma mater was admirable. If the association wished to discuss overseas Chinese education based on research and careful analysis, he was willing to participate from an educational standpoint. However, if they disregarded the facts and made reckless attacks, which would not help the situation, then he would not accept their invitation.</p>

<h3>University Education Association of Shanghai Invited Zhang Taiyan to Lecture on Cultural Revival Yesterday</h3>
<p>Historically Presented Evidence Proving Manchuria is Chinese Territory</p>
<p>Conclusion: To Save the Nation, One Must First Study History</p>
<p>The University Faculty Association of Shanghai invited the renowned scholar Zhang Taiyan to give a second academic lecture yesterday. Over five hundred members of the association, including Zhang Shouyong, Kang Xuanyi, Lin Zhongke, Wu Zijing, Jiang Liangfu, Ouyang Xi, Chen Jilie, as well as teachers and students from various schools, attended the lecture. Zhang Shouyong presided over the meeting, Chen Jilie served as the master of ceremonies, and after the customary greetings, Mr. Zhang began his lecture. The gist of his speech was that national history is like an individual's account book. If an individual forgets their account book, their real estate may be encroached upon without their knowledge. If a nation is ignorant of its history, its territory may be lost without remorse. Therefore, those who seek to destroy a nation always start by destroying its history. When Qin conquered the six states, it burned the books of the six states. When Japan sought to subjugate Korea, it first destroyed Korean history. History is the root of all culture, like the skin to fur. If the skin is gone, where will the fur attach? Mr. Zhang cited various historical evidences to prove that Manchuria, Chahar, and Rehe were all part of Chinese territory. He also cited precise statistics to show that Manchus actually constituted a minority in the Northeast. There was absolutely no reason to allow them to use the pretext of national self-determination to establish an independent state. It was not surprising that the Japanese distorted the facts, but it was lamentable that most Chinese people were ignorant of their own history and unfamiliar with the evolution of their own national territory, which was like Zhang Zongchang not knowing the number of his own concubines. Therefore, to arouse national consciousness and revive Chinese culture, one must study history. Even the success of the Xinhai Revolution was largely due to the inspiration derived from historical studies. Finally, Chairman Zhang Shouyong elaborated further on Zhang's ideas and then announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<h3>Track and Field Competition: Baihong Team Overwhelms Russian Émigrés</h3>
<p>Motovkin Breaks Chinese 16-Pound Shot Put Record with 12.74 Meters</p>
<p>Chen Baoqiu Second with 12.08 Meters</p>
<p>Score: 53 to 29</p>
<p>The Baihong Track and Field Team overwhelmed the strong Russian Émigré Sports Association with a score of 53 to 29, winning the silver cup presented by Director Pan Gongzhan of the Education Bureau. Team captain Cheng Yize of the renowned team hosted a banquet at the Daya Restaurant last night to celebrate the victory.</p>
<p>Outstanding Performance: The most outstanding performance was undoubtedly Motovkin's 16-pound shot put, breaking Liu Renxiu's national record of 12.24 meters with a throw of 12.74 meters. Although Chen Baoqiu came in second, his score of 12.08 meters was also commendable. Motovkin also broke the Chinese 12-pound shot put record at the Five-Group Sports Meet with a throw of over 45 feet. This person is assured of first place in the All-China Games. Secondly, Zeng Rongzhong's 400 meters in 54 seconds was also a good performance, surpassing Guan Changfa. Qiqiliefu's 10,000 meters in exactly 36 minutes was crisp and clean, leaving Chen Xuzhou behind by 400 meters. Other achievements included Wang Yongmin's triple jump of 13.2 meters and Jiemujin's high jump of 1.77 meters, all above average. The Russian Émigré team's defeat was due to their small number of participants, with only one person competing in the hurdles and 400 meters, and the 200 meters being cancelled due to the Russian Émigrés' lack of personnel.

<p>Track and Field Concludes Today, Ball Games Begin Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Hangzhou, 28th) The Zhejiang Provincial Games opened in Hangzhou on the first day (27th). The weather was unfavorable, affecting the progress of the competition. Around 4:00 PM, heavy rain poured down, ending the competition. Events that could not be held on the first day included the high jump (already held for the college group), the 400-meter intermediate hurdles, the triple jump, the 1500 meters, and the men's junior 200-meter intermediate hurdles. The rain did not stop the night before. Although the rain stopped yesterday morning, the sky was overcast with occasional light rain. The program was heavy, and the competition had to continue. It started at 9:00 AM. The venue was very wet, making it inconvenient to throw heavy objects, but this had no impact on the track events. There were few participants, and not many schools or groups visited. The weather was quite good in the afternoon, with sunshine. The number of spectators increased sharply, and the referees worked hard, without rest, to ensure that the heavy schedule could be completed on time. Ball games will begin tomorrow.</p>

<p>In the 1500-meter final, Zhijiang's Wu Zhigao finished first in the college group with a mediocre time of 5 minutes and 6 seconds. In the public group, Hangzhou's Zhao Baode broke Ling Tingquan's Zhejiang provincial record of 4 minutes and 54.6 seconds with a time of 4 minutes and 52.4 seconds. In the men's senior group, Ling Tingquan from District 1 broke his own original record and the newly created record of 4 minutes and 2 seconds by Zhao Baode with a time of 4 minutes and 45.2 seconds. However, in the men's junior group, Hong Yongtang from District 2 broke all previous and current records with a time of 4 minutes and 42.6 seconds, regaining the highest Zhejiang provincial record. This person is nimble and light-footed, and achieving this result was no accident. He is truly a promising talent.</p>
<p>Men's Senior High Jump Xu Huang (District 4) won first place. His form was not beautiful, and the height was 1.54 meters, far less than the public group. Qian Chengfeng from District 2 was second with 1.52 meters, a very small difference from the first place. Lin Zaiwei (District 2) was around 1.50 meters, and Chuan Jun from District 1 was fourth with 1.49 meters.</p>
<p>Public Group Intermediate Hurdles There were no good performances. Everyone knocked down hurdles, and by the last two hurdles, they were exhausted, barely clearing them, and their form was terrible. Hangzhou's Jin Mengjiang finished first with a very poor time of 68.2 seconds.</p>
<p>Men's Senior Intermediate Hurdles District 1 and District 2 split the honors, each getting two places. However, District 1 won a total of seven points. Xu Shiyan finished first with a very poor time of 67 seconds. Their form was not good, but the competition was intense.</p>
<p>College 1500 Meters Aviation's Le Yiqin and Zhijiang's Wu Zhigao competed fiercely. Meng Guangxin was also well-known and unwilling to be outdone. They fought for the lead, and the competition was even. In the end, Zhijiang's Wu Zhigao finished first, Le was second, and Meng was third, with a mediocre time of 5 minutes and 6 seconds.</p>
<p>Public 1500 Meters This final was also a continuation of yesterday's program. In this group, Hangzhou's Zhao Baode set a new Zhejiang provincial record with a time of 4 minutes and 52.4 seconds, breaking the original record of 4 minutes and 54.6 seconds held by Ling Tingquan. Jin Zhiming from Wuxing was second, Rong Shilin from Hangxian was third, and Xu Shouqiang from Tiantai was fourth.</p>
<p>Men's Senior 1500 Meters Ling Tingquan (District 1), who holds the highest Zhejiang provincial record for this event, was in excellent form and had a large stride. He broke his own record with a time of 4 minutes and 45.2 seconds, re-establishing the new Zhejiang provincial record and far surpassing Zhao Baode's new record in the public group. Yu Fengmao from District 2 was second, Hu Dewen from District 2 was third, and Xiao Shaopei from District 1 was fourth.</p>
<p>Women's Senior High Jump Zhou Xiexiang (District 1), Si Feng (District 1), and Zhou Yuru (District 1) competed fiercely. Their skills were equal. In the end, Zhou Xiexiang won the championship, Si Feng was second, and Zhou Yuru was third. Zhu Jiasun was fourth. All were from District 1. The result was 1.24 meters, which was quite good.</p>
<p>Men's Senior 100 Meters The semifinal for this event was cancelled, and the final was held yesterday. Chen Jiarui and Chuan Jun, the first-place winners in the two preliminary groups, had similar skills and both intended to compete for the championship. However, Li Shouzhen was also determined and exerted his energy to strive for a high position. The situation was quite tense. Chen Jiarui ultimately won first place with a time of 12.4 seconds. Chuan Jun was third, and Li Shouzhen took second. Gao Depei finished fourth.</p>
<p>Public 100 Meters This group also had no semifinals and held the final at the same time as the men's senior. Hangzhou's Chen Kuizhang had the best preliminary result and was very hopeful for the final. However, merit prevails, and Chen ultimately won the championship with a time of 12.5 seconds. Ge Qukang followed closely behind and took second place. Guo Qiaozhi was third, and He Kaoti was fourth.</p>
<p>Women's Senior 100 Meters Ju Bin had the best preliminary result, followed by Ma Yumei. The final yesterday lived up to expectations. Ju finished first and Ma finished second with a time of 15.3 seconds. Ju set a new Zhejiang provincial record, beating Rong Shuzhen's original record (15.4 seconds) by 0.1 seconds. Zheng Hanshu was third, and Zhang Zhuhua was fourth.</p>
<p>Men's Senior Discus Among the less outstanding, the tallest is king. The highest Zhejiang provincial record for discus is only 27.80 meters. In this men's senior discus final, Jian Jize from District 2 won the championship with 27.24 meters, which is not bad compared to the highest record. Yao Runlu (District 1) was second with 25.41 meters, Wang Jiancun (District 2) was third with 24.5 meters, and Wu Yulin (District 2) was fourth with 24.43 meters.</p>
<p>College Discus Leng Peiji (Aviation), who holds the highest Zhejiang provincial record for discus, stood out from the crowd and re-established the new Zhejiang provincial record with 29.45 meters, breaking his own original record of 27.80 meters, which is enough to be proud of. The results for the following three are as follows: (2) Wu Jingshu (Zhijiang), 26.57 meters, (3) Zhou Xihu (Aviation) 25.25 meters, (4) Zhou Chongdao (Aviation) 2.70 meters.</p>
<p>Public Discus In this group's final, there were no good results. The throwing form was also poor. (1) Yuan He (Hangzhou) 26.23 meters, (2) Dai Licheng (Fenghua) 25.48 meters, (3) Li Jiamin (Yinxian) 22.43 meters, (4) Wei Jiyan (Wuxing) 21.64 meters.</p>
<p>Public 200 Meters Haining's Ge Qukang, after losing to Hangzhou's Chen Kuizhang in the 100 meters, eagerly wanted revenge. In the 200 meters, the two fought fiercely again. In the end, Ge Qukang achieved his wish and won first place with a time of 24.9 seconds. Chen finished second, Zhang Yunhe was third, and Shao Yanzhe was fourth.</p>
<p>Men's Senior 200 Meters Chen Jiarui, the 100-meter champion, won first place in the 200 meters again with a mediocre result of 25.2 seconds. Huang Yunhua was second, not far behind. Their stride was not good, and they showed no energy at the finish line. Women's Senior First Throw Discus Very few women do the discus. This competition had this event. However, the athletes had no proper training, so it was difficult to expect good results. They had no proper throwing technique. The results are as follows: (1) Zhou Xiang (District 1) 17.51 meters, (2) Xie Fuchu (District 2) 15.62 meters, (3) Zhu Yingxi (District 1) 15.26 meters, (4) Shen Jiacen (District 1) 14.39 meters. The women's junior results were actually better than the senior's. (1) Cai Zhenxuan 17.66 meters, (2) Xu Deyi 17.56 meters, (3) Xu Minzhen 17.03 meters, (4) Lu Meifen 15.85 meters, all from District 2.</p>
<p>College Javelin Leng Peiji (Aviation), who holds the highest Zhejiang provincial record for this event, made great progress and won the championship with 43 meters, breaking his own highest record of 40.13 meters. This result is very impressive. Song Jinhai from the Art College, who came in second, also broke the Zhejiang provincial record with a distance of 41.14 meters, which is commendable. Chen Zhenxi from Zhijiang was third with 36.37 meters. Fourth place was not taken because there were only four participants.</p>
<p>Men's Junior Triple Jump The results for the four men's junior triple jumpers were very close, and the first and second place winners both broke the highest Zhejiang provincial record. The original record was 11.79 meters. Wang He, who came in first, jumped 11.92 meters, and Wu Huimo, who came in second, jumped 11.83 meters, both new records. Zhu Fahe was third with 11.26 meters, and Chen Bohu was also 11.26 meters. The results for third and fourth place were equal, and they had another final. Zhu won with 11.31, and the junior team all got something, which was not easy.</p>
<p>College Triple Jump Hua Yezhao (Art College), who holds the highest record for this event, again broke his own record with 12.05 meters, which is gratifying, and is better than Wang He's 11.92 meters for the men's junior division. The following three are all from Aviation: Leng Peigen was second with 11.05 meters, Tai Ende was third with 10.95 meters, and Lu Taiyuan was fourth with 10.94 meters.</p>

<h3>Group Calisthenics Performance</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 8:30 a.m., morning exercises began. Participants included female students from four schools: Hangzhou Normal High School, Hangzhou Girls' High School, and the two departments of the Municipal High School. The whole group was unified, with a lively attitude and agile movements. Amidst the graceful movements, there was a vigorous spirit. Next was the American-style freehand exercise by the female students of Hangzhou Normal School. The performance was pure and enthusiastic, with many changes, and could be called outstanding. Following this was the imitative exercise by Muxing Middle School. At that time, the weather was not cooperating. Fine rain was drizzling, and the cold wind was blowing, making people want to leave. However, the students of Muxing School performed neatly and with full spirit, which shows that their daily training was effective. Next was the flexibility exercise by the male students of the Municipal High School. The steps were orderly and the movements were in sync. Finally, there was the flexibility exercise by the Provincial First High School. The movements were looping and reciprocating, and turning around in the middle, which was quite worth seeing. After the exercise was over, suddenly a "handkerchief passing competition" was added, the pattern was new, and the turn of the face was particularly open, which was especially unique.</p>
<p>Inviting Liu Xuesong to give a speech: The conference is scheduled to invite Liu Xuesong, director of physical education at Zhejiang University of Arts and Sciences, to give a speech at the YMCA gymnasium at 7:30 p.m. on the 28th, and to show a film about the Chinese delegation's participation in the World Games.

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Mirage</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>A mirage was recently discovered off the coast of Qingdao. It was as tall as a two-story building and appeared twice, in the morning and afternoon, causing a sensation with crowds of onlookers. This is worth recording.</p>
<p>Records of mirages along the Shandong coast are countless in the writings of the past. Wang Ningzhai's "Autumn Clear Miscellany" has a passage recording the Dengzhou mirage, which seems even more spectacular than today's Qingdao mirage. I will excerpt it below...</p>
<p>"Mirages in my hometown are most common in Dengzhou's Penglai Pavilion. Usually around the spring and summer equinoxes, when the easterly wind comes slowly and the water is calm, people often see them. The appearance of the mirage varies. Sometimes city walls rise faintly, resembling a metropolis; sometimes countless tiles are arranged neatly, thousands of doors are opened wide, with carriages bustling and people milling like weaving; sometimes forests and pagodas appear, with towering pavilions and magnificent halls, dazzlingly beautiful. Sometimes peaks rise abruptly, with thousands of chapters of summer trees, exotic animals, and rare birds, like a painting. In the early years of the Shunzhi reign, the garrison commander of Dengzhou held a banquet for guests in the pavilion. As they were drinking and chatting merrily, suddenly countless battleships appeared, covering the sea, and the people on board were all soldiers in armor with spears. The garrison commander was alarmed, thinking they were pirates, and immediately called off the banquet and went on alert. Suddenly, the ships and people all disappeared, leaving only the sea and sky, shimmering together."</p>
<p>Originally, all things in the world are like mirages! The Qingdao mirage disappeared after one hour in the morning and after half an hour in the afternoon. One should view all things in the world in this way. When they disappear, what difference is there between reality and illusion? As for the battleships seen on Penglai Pavilion, after a blink of an eye, only the sky and sea remain! Wang Ningzhai's account is a refreshing remedy for those who pursue militarism and expansion.</p>
<h3>Shaving</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>Without historical research, everyone would know that the hair of the ancients was always tied up in a bun on top of the head, covered with crowns, scarves, hats, etc. Zengzi even said, "Our body, hair, and skin are received from our parents, and we dare not damage them." Therefore, apart from washing and combing, they probably did not shave their hair. Until Huang Shangu's collection of poems included the line "If the heart is at home without leaving home, why bother to seek a book of shaving?", it made people wonder: What was in that book, which is now lost? According to Li Diaoyuan, this book may have been similar to the "Eye Song" of the Tang Dynasty. The "Eye Song" is a short text for shaving a child's newborn hair, which may not be accurate. Therefore, it is not easy to clearly determine whether the ancients shaved their hair or not. But as I see it, they only trimmed their sideburns and shaved their beards at most. There are two reasons for this: (1) They did not want to become shaved monks because they wanted to be loyal to the emperor and filial to their parents. (2) They wanted to be Zhou Bian and Yin Xu, cultivating an elegant and noble demeanor to show the dignity of the special class of scholar-officials. Li Bai's letting down his hair and drifting on a boat, and Qu Yuan's disheveled hair while wandering, were just attempts to imitate the unceremonious fishermen and woodcutters in the great nature after being resentful of the world.</p>
<p>This trend of not shaving one's hair continued until the fall of the Ming Dynasty, when it disappeared. The Qing Dynasty ordered the entire country to follow the Manchurian custom of wearing a queue (braid) and to start shaving the head. This was a very strange change in Chinese history. I remember a Ming Dynasty Confucian official who had a satirical poem:</p>
<p>"Hearing that heads can be shaved, now they are shaved. All heads can be shaved, and heads cannot be made without shaving. Let them shave freely, the head is still my head; look at the shavers, people will also shave their heads!" The meaning of this poem is to say that although the Great Ming has fallen to you, you will also fall to others! Finally, after 268 years of the country, it was overthrown by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's efforts, and the Republic of China was established 22 years ago! Not only was the queue abolished, but heads are now shaved into the style of the army, almost like monks. Not only men but also young ladies and old ladies have cut off their black hair and shaped it into cloud-like hair styles.</p>
<p>The affairs of the world, just from the shaving of the head alone, have become infinitely changeable and unpredictable. What's more, now, in the occupied Northeast provinces, before September 18th, the Five-Colored Flag was once raised, followed by the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag. And now, the Blue Dragon Red Sun Flag is flying again, and the country name has been changed to Manchuria. The former Qing emperor Puyi, who ruined the country, was actually supported as the orthodox!</p>
<p>The Manchurian state, whipped on by Japan, is attacking us, while at the same time, the Red Army in Jiangxi is also threatening the Nanjing government: mutually intertwined, the national affairs are shattered. You shave my head, and I shave your head. Each uses the other's method to treat the other's person. If we do not eliminate all the evils with the spirit of revolution, and at the same time cater to the trend of the times and reform politics, then it is indeed because Heaven has no eyes if China does not perish! Those who advocate the idea that disasters can revitalize a nation, creating the loss of rights and humiliation with compromise, such people will never be able to shave other people's heads; they only deserve to have their heads shaved by others!</p>

<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Severing Affection with a Few Words and Weeping Behind Closed Doors, Shouldering Responsibility and Discussing Business Over Wine</p>
<p>Company Commander Zhao took the wine cup in front of his father, followed by Tian Qing's wine, and said with a smile, "My father is very happy today, you three can offer him a cup. But you can only offer him one cup. If you want to offer him more, then you can only let me represent him." Tian Qing laughed and said, "How about this, I'll be a little presumptuous and have a few drinking bouts with the old man. Let Company Commander drink the wine instead. Everyone, what do you think of this idea?" As he said this, he rolled up his sleeves and winked at Yin and Guan. Can Ziqiang saw this and immediately understood what he meant, so he said, "Okay, having a few bouts of drinking can also liven things up." As he said this, he turned his head and said to Zhao Weng, "Dad, have a few bouts with them. They're bullying you, so have a few bouts with them." Tian Qing stood up, still not sitting down, and stretched out his hand, waving it at Zhao Weng and saying, "Old man, come on, come on." People who like to drink always agree with someone who proposes drinking, so he also stretched out his hand and waved it at Tian Qing. Then, he started shouting loudly, "Five, six," and so on. Zhao Weng was very good at drinking bouts. In ten bouts, Tian Qing lost seven bouts. So Yin Deren and Guan Yaowu said, as they moved forward to help, and Zhao Weng then began the righteous battle. This commotion greatly concealed Zhao Weng's pent-up complaints. After the dinner was over, Zhao Ziqiang said to Guan Yaowu, "Father, let's go to the front yard." His heart suddenly moved, wondering why he had such a suggestion. Could it be that he wanted me to be a matchmaker? He was afraid of attracting attention from others, so he said to Zhao Weng, "As soon as I came in, I was just eating and drinking. I haven't even visited my relatives in the front yard. Now, I should pay my respects. Otherwise, if they are now in poverty, they might say that I look down on them." As he said this, he stood up and walked towards the outer courtyard. This visit of his will reveal countless twists and turns. (84)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Japan</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>This was told to me by a friend who has lived in Japan for many years. I will record it on the left like keeping accounts.</p>
<p>Cherry blossoms are the national flower of Japan. Every year during the cherry blossom season, men and women carry flasks and travel along the roads in endless streams, as if the whole country is in a frenzy. Besides cherry blossoms, they also love lotus flowers. The Shinobazu Pond in Ueno Park is filled with lotus flowers blooming beautifully, mostly crimson and white. When the autumn wind brings coolness, the lotus seed pods mature, but they never pick the lotus seeds for food, letting them wither and decay.</p>
<p>The cost of living is more than twice as high as in our country. For example, eggs cost one dime each, and rice costs more than forty yuan per dan. However, there are also some very cheap things, such as red bean cakes, which cost only two copper coins per piece. Like the wild chicken droppings eaten by the lower classes in our country, they are wonderful items to fill the stomach.</p>
<p>Most parks have fishing facilities. To enjoy this activity, you must buy a ticket. For the price of one dime, you can get a fishing rod. Clear water ripples, and you can fish at will. It is truly an elegant and interesting pursuit. However, these rods are baked over a fire and are very fragile. Greedy friends like to catch big fish, but the rod cannot bear the weight and breaks easily. Experienced people only catch small fish, catching one after another until the rod breaks, catching dozens of fish. The seller provides a large glass tank, so you can take the live fish home.</p>
<p>The Japanese are obsessed with cleanliness. Houses are thoroughly cleaned every week. Even in the summer, there are no crawling bedbugs in the walls. In their mouths, they don't call them bedbugs, but "Nanjing bugs." Could this be a specialty of Nanjing in our country? That would be too arbitrary.</p>
<p>The Japanese like to eat Chinese food very much. In Tokyo, there is the China Building, a purely Chinese restaurant. Most of our students flock to it, and the Japanese also admit that it is cheap and delicious, often inviting friends to feast there. Stir-fried intestines are fatty, delicious, and fragrant, especially to their taste. The intestines are pork intestines, because their chefs do not know how to cook pork intestines, so they can only go to the China Building to taste the unique flavor.</p>
<p>Soldiers must have a certain weight when they enlist. During conscription, some people often deliberately do not eat for several days, starving themselves until they are emaciated. This is similar to the "broken arm old man" sung by our ancient poets. War is dangerous and frightening, so it is no wonder the Japanese do this.</p>
<p>Cherry blossom girls bathing in the open air is not unusual. Sometimes, they swim and play in the waves, and when they are tired, they dig sand into a pit and bury their naked bodies in it, as if they are embracing a lifetime of quilts. According to them, it is very comfortable. The mystery of women has been completely broken, so hiring a model for sketching in that country is very cheap. For four yuan a week, you can make her sit naked all day long.</p>
<p>The Shiba Park prohibits Chinese and Koreans from entering, like the foreign Bund park in Shanghai before it was opened, which prohibited Chinese and dogs from entering. Their reason for the ban is that Chinese and Koreans spit everywhere, which easily spreads diseases and is a major obstacle to hygiene.</p>
<h3>Wit and Humor</h3>
<p>— Drunk Crazy Student</p>
<p>Praying for Peace: A certain Mr. Jia is known to be henpecked. One day, he angered his wife over a trivial matter and was forced to kneel in front of the bed. A friend happened to come and saw Mr. Jia groveling. Surprised, he asked, "What are you doing?" Mr. Jia hesitated and said, "You don't know my suffering. I am 'praying for peace'!" Luring the Enemy Deep: A certain woman, Mrs. Jia, accused a certain Mr. Yi of rape. The judge summoned both parties for questioning. Mr. Yi hired a lawyer to defend him, saying that Mrs. Jia did not resist at the time, so it cannot be called rape. The judge then asked Mrs. Jia, "If you say he raped you, why did you adopt a non-resistance policy?" Mrs. Jia replied, "I was not being non-resistant. I was 'luring the enemy deep'!"</p>

<h3>Housewife's Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>Child-Rearing Essentials</p>
<p>First Month After Birth丨The baby's weight at birth is not to be neglected. The eyes and umbilical cord must be kept clean. Sleep should be more than twenty hours. Do not make loud noises to startle the baby during sleep. Feeding times should be regular and not haphazard. If the baby cries after waking, give warm boiled water. It is best to breastfeed every three hours. Wash the breasts with boric acid solution or wipe them clean with medicated cotton wool. Do not hold the baby in your arms constantly. Bedding must be kept clean, and wet diapers should be changed immediately. The pillow should not be too high, and the baby's head should be moved frequently during sleep to prevent the head from becoming misshapen. The water for bathing should be between 29 and 40 degrees Celsius. Each bath should last about seven or eight minutes and not be too long. The best time for bathing is 10 a.m. or 2 p.m. Be sure that no soapy water remains on the skin after bathing.</p>
<p>Second Month After Birth丨If the baby cries outside of feeding times, give warm boiled water. Prevent the bad habit of sucking fingers in the mouth and prevent unclean hands from rubbing the eyes. Pay attention to the color of the stool. If the stool is blocked, dilute maltose with warm water and give two or three spoonfuls, or dip two or three paper twists into soapy water and insert them into the anus.</p>
<p>Third and Fourth Months After Birth丨On windless, sunny days, move the baby to the outdoors in a lightweight crib to receive sunlight, but pay attention to the season. In winter, do this at noon; in spring and autumn, between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.; and in summer, before 10 a.m. and after 4 p.m. However, when sunbathing, the baby's face should not be directly in the sun. Early summer is the best time of year for sunbathing because the ultraviolet rays in the sunlight are twice as strong as in winter.</p>
<p>Fifth Month After Birth丨At this time, stop feeding at night. Gradually reduce the number of feedings each night to avoid indigestion.</p>
<p>Sixth Month After Birth丨Vaccinate at this time. If the baby shows signs of discomfort, first take the temperature and then consult a doctor. Do not listen blindly to others or engage in superstitious activities such as praying to gods and Buddhas.</p>
<p>Seventh and Eighth Months After Birth丨Prepare to wean the baby by feeding pureed vegetables, radish soup, etc., two or three spoonfuls a day, gradually increasing the number of times and amounts. After two weeks, add a little salt to the soup, and gradually give thin rice water and porridge.</p>
<p>Ninth Month After Birth丨Frequently give fruit juice or freshly squeezed sugarcane, tangerine, or pear juice, or add a few drops of cod liver oil to the fruit juice. You can also add a little lard, butter, or white sugar soy sauce to the thin porridge.</p>
<p>Tenth Month After Birth丨At this time, the baby's sense of taste becomes more sensitive, and the baby can distinguish between good and bad. If the baby refuses to eat something because it is not good, you should comply when the baby wants something else. However, the baby should try everything that does not harm hygiene to avoid developing picky eating habits later.</p>
<p>Eleventh and Twelfth Months After Birth丨Do not glare or scold the baby. You should raise the baby gently. If the baby has any bad habits, correct them gradually at this time. If the baby likes music, choose peaceful melodies to please the baby's heart.</p>
<p>Household Knowledge</p>
<p>Cleaning丨In middle-class and upper-class families, cleaning is usually the duty of servants. However, they have no knowledge of hygiene and are often perfunctory. The housewife should supervise them personally, paying particular attention to the corners of the room and places without sunlight. In the countryside, you can use lime water instead of disinfectant.</p>
<p>Glass Windows丨To wipe glass windows, first wipe the window frame clean with lukewarm water, then wipe the glass. If lukewarm water does not clean it, you can use a little alcohol or ammonia water.</p>
<p>Pots丨Whether copper, iron, or enameled, pots for cooking should be scrubbed with rice straw ash after cooking to prevent rust.</p>
<p>Porcelain丨When cups, bowls, spoons, etc., are stained, they can be boiled in alkaline solution to make them as white as new.</p>
<p>Soup Stains丨Generally, if iron bottles used for holding dishes have soup stains, add a little soda and boil them with water to the full capacity of the bottle to remove the stains.</p>
<p>Ink Stains丨If clothes are stained with ink, wash them with milk to remove the stains easily.</p>
<p>Rice Bins丨When buying rice, you must take out the old rice. Do not leave any old rice in the corners of the bin because it easily breeds insects and reduces the nutritional value.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Voice of the Nation</h3>
<p>— Shiheng</p>
<p>In last month's "Free Talk," Mr. XX wrote an article on "The Bachelor's Lament" and "Tears on a Barren Mountain." It is said that these two ditties have been sung to foreigners as national anthems. The former is about the Great Qing Dynasty, and the latter is about the current Party-State. Both are mournful and wailing. Although foreigners may not understand the meaning or words, they will understand the pitiful tunes. I think this pitiful tune is precisely the voice of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>China currently has no widely recognized national anthem, which seems inevitable. What kind of tune can concretely represent the path this aging nation is taking and the general decline in the lives of its people? If a great composer actually created a solemn and majestic national anthem, could that song truly represent this nation that has fallen beyond any further fall? The life of this nation inevitably leads it to emit sounds like "Tears on a Barren Mountain" and "The Bachelor's Lament." Isn't that precisely its national voice?</p>
<p>Although we have no national anthem, in recent years, there have been tunes that men, women, old, and young can all recite. The representative of these tunes is something like "Drizzling Rain." At first, it only circulated in the Shanghai area, but later it became popular throughout the country. Many primary schools even taught them to boys and girls. But aren't these popular tunes largely the same as "Tears on a Barren Mountain" and "The Bachelor's Lament"?</p>
<p>But why did these new mournful and wailing tunes become so rapidly popular throughout the country? Because they perfectly fit the life of this nation. A national life perfectly suited to this kind of leisurely and bored song. We wonder, what kind of leisurely and bored national life is that?</p>
<p>New art critics analyze the most popular "Jazz Music" in Europe and America, saying that it is music that expresses the victory of the bourgeoisie. So, what does our "Drizzling Rain" express? Couldn't we say that it expresses the sound of our nation's death?</p>
<h3>Dark Night</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>What, what? None of those things were written by me. What could I write? Lately, I've been very afraid, afraid of people mentioning me. The wind is really strong tonight. I'm afraid a few more boats will capsize in the river! Ah, ah, ha, what, the lights went out? Oh, it's back, ah, it dimmed again. Wait a moment, it'll probably come back. Sitting here in the darkness like this is kind of interesting. Oh, do you have matches? Wait a moment, let me find a candle. … Ouch, damn it, the chair broke my leg! It's okay, it's okay, good, I got it…</p>
<p>The candlelight is quite fun. Alas, do you remember? The article I wrote today imitating a primary school textbook... "In the third month of late spring, peonies are in full bloom. I and my friends are playing in the courtyard. Swallows fly in, diligently seeking food. Can we be less diligent than birds?" I just thought of another one, "Li Sheng studies diligently at night. The northwest wind rises and blows out the electric light, the light of the candle." Alas... I can't do anything lately, but I can still write these kinds of little articles, not bad, right? My wife? Sigh, I hope she's not sick! I'd like to go back for a visit during the summer vacation. But I'm afraid that going back for a visit will lead to another child, which would be too troublesome. Do you have any more wine there? Oh, don't blow out the candle! The wind is really strong! It's terrible! … Go get it, the wine? Wait a moment, grab a box of matches, I'll go with you. … The lights in the corridor are out too? Be careful of the stairs! Oh, it's out! Damn it, let's not light it, it'll just blow out anyway when we go outside. … Oh, oh, what a strong wind! Cold! So cold! … Sigh!</p>
<h3>Beyond Two Types of People</h3>
<p>— Li You</p>
<p>Mr. Bofu divides people into two types: those with a prose temperament and those with a poetic temperament. (See the May 17th Free Talk)</p>
<p>But I believe that beyond these two types of people, there also exists a dramatic temperament - and it is the most common. These people do not need to cater to the world, nor do they necessarily need to make the world suit them; they simply act freely and always find themselves in advantageous situations. They only look for opportunities. At one moment, they seem as lovable as people with a prose temperament; but at another moment, they appear as lofty as people with a poetic temperament.</p>
<p>Without these people with a dramatic temperament, the world would seem lonely and monotonous! Because they are the movers of all tragedies and the manipulators of all comedies.</p>
<p>Historically, the great achievements of these people are recorded the most. In prosperous times, they create rituals, compose music, sing praises, fawn over superiors, slander peers, betray friends, and think of ways to please their masters. In chaotic times, they support A and denounce B, then support C and denounce A; "good birds choose trees to perch on," so they may as well support B and denounce A or C again. Especially during dynastic changes, they are the ones who curse the rebels, punish and dismantle those who died for the country, surrender to the enemy, praise the holy ruler, and suddenly switch sides. "He who kills my lord is my enemy, and he who kills my enemy is my lord." With just a turn of the tongue, they can become veterans of five dynasties.</p>
<p>People with a rich dramatic temperament are the most adaptable. You see them clearly in that circle, but actually they are not; when you look again, they are already outside this circle. Yesterday we were good friends, today we can call the police to arrest you when we meet on the road. If the revolution succeeds tomorrow, I will turn around and be your old comrade again.</p>
<p>The most important characteristic of people with a dramatic temperament is that they have a well-trained tail, which wags when it should wag, stands erect when it should stand erect, and tucks in when it should tuck in, truly without anything that is not beneficial. The French poet La Rochefoucauld said: "People are like dogs, they also have long tails and short tails. Some people's short tails are innate, some are because they did not do well. People with short tails are in a difficult position… but people with long tails are happy." Today is an era of encouraging "confession" and "denunciation," quickly train yourself to grow a long tail! If unfortunately your tail is naturally short.</p>
<p>Therefore, people with a prose temperament are often successful. (Conversely, those who die violently are the "king who succeeds and the bandit who fails" has been the case since ancient times) People with a poetic temperament are often parasites. (Mr. Bofu's words) Only people with a dramatic temperament are eternally victorious!</p>
<h3>Ramblings from Qu Lu</h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(35) Talking About Ghosts</p>
<p>Spring arrives in the village on the Qingfeng River,</p>
<p>My hometown should have souls unsummoned.</p>
<p>As a guest, I shamelessly talk about ghosts,</p>
<p>Unknowingly, the world turns gloomy and dark.</p>
<p>This is one of my ten untitled quatrains from six years ago in spring. At that time, I didn't talk about national affairs or read the news. When friends met, they only talked about foxes and ghosts to amuse themselves. This poem is a summary of this kind of life and its mood. My late father was well-versed in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio and often praised Pu Liuxian's character. My fondness for talking about foxes and ghosts also stemmed from childhood. I still remember a quatrain I wrote on a painting of Pu Liuxian writing his book:</p>
<p>Let me speak wildly, let them listen wildly,</p>
<p>Rain like silk falls on bean trellises and melon vines.</p>
<p>I suppose they are tired of human talk,</p>
<p>And love to hear ghosts sing poems in autumn graves.</p>
<p>My late father said that Pu Liuxian had anti-Manchu ideas. All the foxes he mentioned were secretly denouncing the Manchus: "fox" sounds like "Hu," referring to the northern barbarians. This book was initially titled Fox Ghost Tales, but fearing the taboo of the time, he changed it to its current name. However, although the book never explicitly criticized the authorities, it actually viewed them as foxes and goblins. At that time, scholars did not distort their learning or fawn on the world to gain profit and rank. Even those who immersed themselves in ancient books and researched the classics often faced great lawsuits if their words were careless. With the government treating scholars so cruelly, talking about foxes and ghosts was also a way for scholars to avoid disaster. It is said that Su Dongpo offended the authorities with his writing and was exiled to Lingnan. He dared not approach pen and ink again and only forced himself to tell ghost stories to pass the long days. When people contradicted him, he would say, "Let me speak wildly." Telling ghost stories to dispel evil was also a good intention of scholars.</p>
<p>(36) A Supplement to "Confucius and Drama"</p>
<p>The book Confucius and Drama collects details quite thoroughly. Here are two more pieces of information that can be added. One is the story of Kong Zonghan of the Song Dynasty. When his father, Daofu, was an envoy to the Khitans, he refused to allow actors to perform a play using Confucius as a subject. He also advised Emperor Zhezong that it was inappropriate to allow actors in the imperial theater to perform plays about Confucius. It can be said that like father, like son. Wang Pi of the Song Dynasty wrote in his Mianshui Yantan Lu: "During the Yuanyou period, on the Lantern Festival, the emperor visited Yingxiang Pool to feast with his ministers. The imperial theater's actors performed a play using the former sage as a subject. Kong Zonghan, a vice minister of the Ministry of Justice, submitted a memorial, saying that during the reign of Emperor Wenzong of the Tang Dynasty, there had been a similar play, and the emperor ordered it to be dismissed. Now, should the holy emperor still tolerate this when he is feasting with his ministers? The emperor ordered the censors to deal with it. Someone said, 'This is a minor matter, why bother mentioning it?' Kong replied, 'You don't understand. The emperor is in his prime, and he should respect virtue and enjoy the Dao. But the base actors are so disrespectful. If this is tolerated and not corrected, will it not harm the emperor's virtue?' Those who heard this were ashamed and impressed." Another incident occurred in the ninth year of the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty, when Emperor Chengzu prohibited lyrics and songs that insulted sages and worthies. Confucius was certainly among those who could not be insulted. From this, it can be said that from the early days of Tang and Song drama, it was not permitted to use Confucius as a subject. During the early Ming Dynasty, when opera flourished, the performance of plays featuring sages and worthies was strictly prohibited. No wonder the performance of the play "Zi Jian Nanzi" at Qufu Normal School caused a great uproar. Since Confucius has been honored and praised by emperors for two thousand years since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, how could the Kong clan tolerate joking with Confucius in the land of his birthplace? This is the origin of the lawsuit over insulting Confucius.</p>
<h3>Red Carrot Whiskers Lice (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic’s… Really, Red Carrot Whiskers, you really make us not understand. You've reached such an age and have grown into a child as big as you are, you should be ashamed. I won’t even talk about your feet being so dirty, maybe you just saw it when you came home. But the lice are biting you, and you neither ask your teachers to clean you up, nor do you ask the people at home to get rid of them. Please tell us, what exactly is the pleasure of letting them eat you alive like this. There is still some blood left in your messy hair.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers… This is because the comb scratches me uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic… Ah! This is because the comb scratches you uncomfortably. Well then, is this how you repay your sister? Do you hear what he says, Elerstin? This delicate gentleman is not satisfied with his barber. My daughter, I advise you to immediately let this voluntary martyr be eaten by his parasites.</p>
<p>Elerstin… I’m just going to let it go today, mom. I only shaved off the most crowded spots for him, and I’ll have to comb him a second time tomorrow. But I know a girl who has lice on her head but still uses perfume.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic… Never mind about others. As for you, Red Carrot Whiskers, give me that basin and put it on the low wall in the garden. This should call the whole village to come and see it so you can be ashamed.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers takes the basin out; he puts the basin under the sun, and he guards it beside it.</p>
<p>The first to come closer to look was old Granny Nanette. Every time she meets Red Carrot Whiskers, she stops, observing him with her near-sighted and cunning little eyes, moving the black soft hat on her head as if she had guessed something.</p>
<p>"What is this thing?" she said.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers did not answer anything. She bent down to look at the basin.</p>
<p>"Are these shelled small lentils? Really, I simply can't see clearly. My son Pierre really should have gotten me a pair of glasses long ago."</p>
<p>She touched it with her fingertips, as if preparing to put it in her mouth to taste it. Judging from the situation, she certainly did not know what was in it.</p>
<p>"And what are you standing here doing? You seem angry, staring blankly. I can say with certainty that someone has scolded you, punished you to stand here. Listen to me, although I am not your grandmother, I am thinking about some things. Poor child, I sympathize with you because I know they must be making your life very difficult."</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers glanced around, looking to see if his mother was nearby, and then said to old Granny Nanette…</p>
<p>"Then what should I do? Why does this matter concern you? You should just mind your own business and let me be quiet."</p>
<p>Like Brutus</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic… Red Carrot Whiskers, you didn't study as hard as I expected last year. Judging from your school report card, you really could have done a little better. But you're just thinking and reading books that are not allowed to be read at school. Your memory is originally very good, and your recitation scores are not bad, but you are unwilling to work hard on your exercises. Red Carrot Whiskers, you should become more serious in the future.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers… Please rest assured, Dad. True, I did slack off a bit last year. This time, I feel that I already have the ambition to work hard desperately. I don't boast that my total score can be the first in the whole class.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic… But you have to try.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers… No. Dad, then you're asking too much. I'm not good at geography, German, physics, chemistry, etc. There are only two or three people who get the best grades in these subjects, and they specialize in these subjects. It's impossible to catch up with them; but I think – listen to me, Dad – I think I can get first place in the Chinese language subject soon, and I won't let anyone take it away again in the future. Even if I work hard desperately and still can't get first place, at least I can have a clear conscience. I can proudly write like Cicero: Ah, "Virtue"! You are just a noun.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic… Ah! My child, I believe you will use these words.</p>
<p>Felix… What did he say, Dad?</p>
<p>Elerstin… I didn't hear clearly either.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic… Me too. Say it again, Red Carrot Whiskers.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers… Ah! I didn't say anything, Mom. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Economic Supplement, Issue 24, Published Every Monday</p>
<h3>Taxing Imported Rice and Achieving Self-Sufficiency in Food   Xu Shuji</h3>
<p>Since last year, the fall in rice prices has been truly unexpected. To speculate on the reasons for this decline, they can be roughly divided into two categories: (1) External reasons, namely (a) the global economic panic, and (b) the surge in imported rice; (2) Internal reasons, namely (a) the lack of political clarity, (b) the economic recession, (c) social instability, and (d) the numerous inherent problems in agriculture itself.  What are the consequences of the fall in rice prices? The agricultural economy is in a difficult situation, without the strength to improve the land, and productivity naturally declines. Since the foundation of China's national economy is still built on agriculture, if agriculture is in this state, the entire national economy will inevitably be affected. Now, to revitalize agriculture and forestry, how should we maintain the price of grain, the only product of farmers? However, maintaining grain prices is a complex issue that cannot be fully covered in this short article. Let us first discuss the issue of rice tariffs.</p>
<p>The issue of grain tariffs has been debated for decades in European countries and Japan and is now a thing of the past. In China, however, it is a fresh issue. To discuss this issue, we should first understand the trend of rice imports over the years and list the statistical figures from the customs trade records since the founding of the Republic (unit: dan):</p>
<p>Year     Quantity     Year     Quantity</p>
<p>Year 1     2,700,391     Year 11     19,156,182</p>
<p>Year 2     5,414,896     Year 12     22,434,962</p>
<p>Year 3     6,814,003     Year 13     13,198,054</p>
<p>Year 4     8,476,058     Year 14     12,624,624</p>
<p>Year 5     11,284,023     Year 15     18,700,797</p>
<p>Year 6     9,837,182     Year 16     21,091,581</p>
<p>Year 7     6,984,025     Year 17     12,616,154</p>
<p>Year 8     1,809,749     Year 18     10,822,805</p>
<p>Year 9     1,151,752     Year 19     19,892,784</p>
<p>Year 10     10,629,245     Year 20     10,740,810</p>
<p>Although the imported rice listed in this table does not increase regularly year by year, the general trend of increase is evident. Looking back at the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras of the late Qing Dynasty, the difference between then and now is even more striking!  Even during the Tongzhi and Guangxu years, the annual rice imports only exceeded 10 million dan in Guangxu 21st year (1895) and 33rd year (1907).  There were only four years that exceeded 9 million dan, and in other years, the imports were at most just over 7 million dan, and as few as just over 6,000 dan (see Mr. Feng Liutang's article "A Brief Overview of Rice Imports Over the Past Two Hundred Years" in "The Shanghai Food Problem"). Comparing this with the recent years, we can see that the increase in rice imports has been considerable.  What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Historically, our country has not only failed to prevent the import of rice but has also sought to encourage it. Looking at the historical facts, we can understand this. For example, during the Yongzheng era of the Qing Dynasty, when Siamese rice arrived in Guangdong, Emperor Shizong of Qing ordered that it be sold at the current market price in Guangdong Province, and all goods on board were exempt from taxes. In the 21st year of Qianlong, it was also decided that Guangdong and Fujian merchants who transported rice should be rewarded.  If merchants from Guangdong and Fujian prepared their own capital and obtained permits to go to countries such as Annam and Siam to transport rice back to the province, they would be granted official titles or caps according to the amount of rice transported.  This shows how welcome the import of rice was.  After the founding of the Republic, the import of grains such as rice, wheat, and corn was still tax-free.  On the other hand, the export of grains was absolutely prohibited. Since the 39th year of Qianlong (1774), when six articles of the Grain Prevention Order were promulgated, those who transported rice out of the country were subject to extreme penalties.  Even to this day, although the ban is no longer so strict, rice still cannot be exported. In comparison, we can see that China's rice policy throughout the ages has been to welcome the import of rice on the one hand and prevent the export of domestic rice on the other.  The underlying reason is nothing more than a respect for the people's food supply, which is not inherently wrong.  However, although the import of rice is sometimes necessary, allowing its free import at any time and in any place will inevitably lead to the danger of it overwhelming domestic rice. The export of rice should also be prohibited at times, but prohibiting all exports regardless of whether it is a year of abundance or scarcity is not a way to promote increased production. Therefore, China's rice policy, which has been passed down through the ages, is indeed a major mistake.</p>
<p>To discuss whether rice tariffs should be levied, there are several preconditions that should be discussed beforehand, namely:</p>
<p>(A) The question of whether domestic rice should be protected. Rice is the main grain in our country, which everyone knows. All countries in the world, except for a few industrial and commercial countries, protect their main grains. These grains are subject to tariffs when imported from abroad. The weight of the tariffs varies from country to country, but they all have a protective effect. Especially in recent years, with the "agricultural panic" spreading around the world, grain tariffs have been increasing year by year. We can see from two tables (tables omitted) in the "Agricultural Situation in 1930 to 1931" compiled by the International Agricultural Association: (1) The wheat import tax in countries such as Germany, France, and Italy in 1930 increased to more than double or twice that of 1913. (2) The grain import tax in Germany increased greatly in 1931 compared to 1930. Compared with the grain prices in London and Liverpool, the amount of import tax for various grains, except for corn, generally exceeds the corresponding grain prices, which shows that Germany's grain tariffs are very high. The same is true for other countries that adopt agricultural protection tariffs. This is not an unconscious increase in tariffs, because since 1929, grain prices in various countries around the world have fallen sharply, and they have a large backlog of goods. Various countries intend to adopt a "beggar-thy-neighbor" policy and strive to dump goods abroad. If country A does not raise tariffs, the grains of country B or country C will take advantage of the opportunity, and the grains of country A will inevitably be overwhelmed. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent this in advance. Among the countries in the world, except for a few countries or colonies, all have rice import taxes (see Mr. Wu Juenong's article "The Issue of Food Import and Tax Exemption" in "The Shanghai Food Problem" compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau). For example, countries such as India, Siam, Taiwan, and Korea, which produce more rice and have surplus grain for export, are not afraid of competition from foreign rice. However, these countries have considerable import taxes. As for Japan, it is originally insufficient to be self-sufficient and seems to welcome foreign imports. However, in order to prevent foreign intrusion and encourage the production of domestic rice, it also has import taxes. Looking back at our country, last year (Year 21), after the autumn harvest in various provinces, the price of rice fell sharply, which was indeed due to a relatively good harvest. However, the main reason is not here. One reason is that the rice merchants in various places believed that there would be a major flood in the Yangtze River basin the year before (Year 20), and the harvest would definitely be poor, and rice prices would inevitably skyrocket. Therefore, they ordered a large number of forward rice from places such as Annam, Siam, and India. Unexpectedly, the opposite happened. The stockpiled rice could not be sold as much as possible, and the imported rice still kept coming. When the new grain came to market, farmers were forced by the economy to sell it one after another, and rice prices fell sharply. Furthermore, although domestic rice had a relatively good harvest, the rice exporting countries in the world have also had "bumper years" in recent years. Looking at the table excerpted below from the "Agricultural Situation in 1930 to 1931", we can understand this.</p>
<p>Asian Rice Exporting Countries (India, Siam, Taiwan, Korea, and Annam) Paddy Production (unit: million Metric Tons)</p>
<p>1927/28     59.7     1928/29     63.6</p>
<p>1929/30     62.2     1930/31     65.0</p>
<p>Originally, the international rice market was supplied by rice from India, Siam, Taiwan, Korea, and Annam, which accounted for almost nine-tenths of the total volume. Since the production of rice in these five places has greatly increased, its export volume has also increased accordingly. However, on the other hand, rice importing countries in Asia have also been affected by the global economic panic, and the market for important products has been very depressed (such as rubber in Ceylon and the Malay Peninsula, and rubber candy and coffee in the Dutch East Indies). As a result, purchasing power has been greatly reduced. Therefore, in foreign countries, the fall in rice prices is even more pronounced. From the rice price index table (1926 equals 100, table omitted due to limited space) published in the "Agricultural Situation in 1930 to 1931", it can be seen that foreign rice prices have fallen by almost half, or even more than half. There are no complete statistics on the production volume and prices of foreign rice between 1931 and 1932, so I dare not make a definite statement. However, in the 21st year of the Republic of China, rice imports reached 22,486,639 dan, an increase of 1.85.02 percent compared to the import volume in the 20th year. It also accounted for 11.36 percent of the net import volume in that year, setting the highest record since China imported rice. (See the third and fourth quarter trade reports of the International Trade Bureau.) It can be seen that domestic rice prices have fallen sharply, but foreign rice prices are also low, and foreign rice reserves are relatively large, so they have to be dumped in our country. Therefore, now, if we think that domestic rice prices have fallen sharply and foreign rice is no longer a concern, it is also incorrect. Therefore, the establishment of rice tariffs is even more necessary.</p>
<p>(B) The question of whether domestic rice is sufficient for self-sufficiency. If our country levies a protective import tax on rice, rice imports will certainly not be as easy as before. In case the amount of rice produced in various provinces is far from enough for consumption, we still have to rely on foreign rice. At this time, if we want to exempt import taxes, foreign rice will take the opportunity of rising domestic rice prices to flow in continuously, and domestic rice production will be greatly hit. If we want to levy the protective tax as usual, our people will have to eat foreign rice, and foreign rice will still be imported. Although the tariff can enter the national treasury, the tariff collected will eventually be passed on to domestic consumers. This is harmless to foreign rice producers and distributors, but it increases the burden on consumers, and the gains may not be worth the losses. Therefore, to levy an import tax on foreign rice, is domestic rice sufficient for self-sufficiency? Or if it is not sufficient, how much is lacking? This question also needs to be studied. According to the investigation, the import volume of rice in our country has increased rapidly in the past ten years, with at least 10 million dan or nearly 20 million dan per year. Including last year, there have been three times that the import volume has reached more than 20 million dan. Estimating its value, the leakage is truly alarming! However, after careful examination, I feel that although the import volume of rice is alarming, in fact, these quantities are still very small in the production or consumption volume of rice in our country. Therefore, I dare to boldly say that domestic rice is almost self-sufficient, and even if it is not sufficient, the amount is not large. To clearly explain this question, we must first know (1) the current production volume and future increase in production of rice, (2) the current consumption volume and future increase in consumption of rice, (3) the current cultivated area and future increase in cultivated area of rice, (4) the current total population and the rate of increase. However, there are no such statistics now, so how dare we talk about it? However, it may be possible to estimate it roughly. Let me briefly explain as follows:</p>
<p>Assuming that the amount of rice lacking in our country each year is exactly the same as the amount of rice imported, then the amount of rice imported each year since the import of rice should be regular, and even if it is due to population growth or increased demand, it should be gradual year by year. However, according to the table listed above, summarizing the import of rice in the past 20 years since the founding of the Republic, it is found that it fluctuates greatly and is rarely orderly. For example, it was 2.7 million dan in the first year of the Republic, and suddenly jumped to more than 5.41 million dan in the second year, increasing by more than double. In the eighth and ninth years, there were only more than 1 million dan, but in the tenth year, it suddenly jumped to more than 10 million dan, and since then it has continued to increase. In the twelfth year, it even reached more than 22 million dan, but in the thirteenth year, it suddenly dropped to more than 13 million dan. In the sixteenth year, it suddenly rose to more than 21 million dan. In the seventeenth and eighteenth years, it fell sharply again. In the nineteenth year, it almost reached 20 million dan. Such unstable fluctuations clearly have other special reasons mixed in, and it is definitely not that we need more than 10 million dan or 20 million dan of rice imports every year in ordinary years. What is the special reason? Because since the founding of the Republic, insect plagues, droughts, floods, or wars have occurred every few years, or continuously and mutually, resulting in famines in many provinces and a shortage of rice. Although some provinces may still have a surplus of rice, because the provinces are self-governing, they prohibit the export of rice. Even if there is a way to beg for grain, due to heavy taxes and many traffic obstacles, the rice cannot arrive as scheduled. Even if it can be transported, the amount is not much, and the price is particularly high. Isn't it more direct and convenient for the rice-deficient provinces to beg for rice from foreign countries? For example, the import of rice in Shanghai was particularly high in the 19th year of the Republic, because of the famine in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the 18th year. Also, the reason why rice imports exceeded 22 million dan last year was also because of concerns about the impact of the flood of the previous year. Even in ordinary years, although rice is still imported, it is also wrong to regard the import volume as the amount of rice lacking in our country. Why? As mentioned earlier, rice in our country and provinces is not freely circulated. Although some provinces have a surplus of rice, they cannot make up for the shortage in other provinces. For example, the rice in Fujian is certainly insufficient, but the people in these two provinces do not eat the rice from Hunan and Hubei, but prefer to eat rice from Annam and Siam, which is a clear proof. Therefore, it is also too crude to simply use the import of rice to prove to what extent the lack of rice in our country has reached. Now, let us go a step further and examine what percentage of the import volume of rice accounts for the production volume and consumption volume of rice in our country, which is the most important thing to determine whether rice is sufficient for self-sufficiency. According to the production volume of rice in our country, although there are many estimates from Chinese and foreign sources, the figures from various parties are vastly different and cannot be trusted. Therefore, it is also futile to examine what percentage of the import volume of rice accounts for the production volume. Now, let us put aside the production volume and export volume of rice and simply compare the import volume and consumption volume to know how many days of food the annual import volume of rice can provide, and we can also roughly estimate how much rice is lacking. According to Mr. Feng Liutang's example, "Fujian and Guangdong originally lacked rice and relied on foreign rice for supply. As for other provinces, unless it is an extremely famine year, the demand for foreign rice is not much. Let us take the year with the largest import of foreign rice in the country (the 12th year of the Republic) as an example. Converted into shi, it is only 14,956,641 shi. If we calculate that each person eats half a sheng per day, according to the national population of 400 million, it is about more than seven days of grain." (See page 96 of "The Shanghai Food Problem" compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau.) The principle of his calculation is very reasonable. However, the import volume of rice in the past 20 years since the founding of the Republic varies from year to year. It is only an example to calculate the year with the most or least imports, but it is not enough for calculation. Now, according to his calculation principle, we will modify the calculation method. First, we will find the annual average of the import volume of rice from the first year to the 20th year of the Republic, which can be 11,321,508.5 dan (100 jin per dan). Converting it into shi (150 jin per shi), we can get 7,547,673 shi. It is certainly difficult to get an accurate number for the population statistics of our country. Let us take the recent survey results of the Ministry of the Interior as the standard. The total population of the country is 474,787,386 people. Assuming that the relevant number of people who eat rice in the entire population is 237,393,693 people (although it is clear how many people eat rice in the entire population, people in provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Yue, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan generally eat rice. According to the population statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the population of these provinces is more than 239 million, which already accounts for more than half of the total population. Although some people in these provinces do not eat rice, and some people outside these provinces also eat rice, they seem to be able to offset each other, so assuming that half of the population in our country eats rice, I think there is not much difference). According to common estimates, each person's daily rice consumption is five ge, then one day requires 1,186,968,465 ge of rice. Dividing this number by 7,547,673 shi, we can know that the average annual import volume in the past 20 years only provides 6.3 days of rice for the entire country. In other words, assuming that rice is never imported, our country only lacks 6.3 days of rice. Calculated by the number of days in the whole year, these 6.3 days only account for 1.72% of the number of days in the whole year. In other words, the import volume of rice only accounts for 1.72% of the annual consumption volume. Judging from this, we can see that the import volume of rice is very small in the consumption volume. If we think that the average annual import volume of rice since the 11th year of the Republic is far more than the average volume in the previous ten years, and it seems too small to use the average volume in the 2nd year, then let us find the average annual volume in the past ten years (11th year to 20th year), which can be 16,132,884.8 dan. Calculated by the same method as mentioned above, we can know that the average annual import volume only provides 9 days of rice for the whole country, that is, the import volume of rice only accounts for 2.4% of the annual consumption volume. Although this quantity is more than the previous calculation, it is not large. Mr. Hou Houpei also said, according to his calculation results, "Foreign rice imports account for about 4.3% of my country's rice consumption." (See page 14 of the "Food Import Issues" in the fourth issue of the second volume of the "International Trade Guide") Comparing this number with my calculation number, although it is almost doubled, it can also be seen that the import volume of rice is very small in the consumption volume. Judging from these facts, assuming that there are no droughts or floods in various provinces of our country, no bandits, no foreign insults, and farmers can live and work in peace and cultivate their fields diligently, even if rice is absolutely freely circulated between provinces, mutually adjusting each other, needless to say, farmers can improve rice fields and greatly increase rice production. Even if we operate well according to the indigenous method, I dare to boldly say that the rice produced annually in our country is almost enough to supply the consumption of the whole country. Our country does not eat foreign rice, nor will it starve to death; because the proportion of the import volume of rice to the national consumption volume is so small, and the rice consumed annually in the country for brewing and other purposes, although there are no definite statistics, the number is also very large. If our country all embraces the determination to endure hardship and adopt a policy of frugality, even if there is a slight shortage, it can be replaced by miscellaneous grains, so why rely on foreign rice every year? Moreover, the rice fields in our country have great potential for increasing yields. More than ten years ago, when I lectured at the Agricultural University of Beiping on "The Future of Agricultural Production in China," I estimated the increase in yields in the rice fields of nine provinces, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Yue, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guangdong. If each mu can increase the yield of rice by one dou and six ge, the total amount of increased rice in the nine provinces can be more than 19,920,147 shi. The cultivated area used in this calculation is based on the household regulations of the former Qing Ministry of Revenue, and the number obtained is originally too small. However, it is already so large, and we can know that if these nine provinces or other provinces build extensive water conservancy and add paddy fields, the increase in rice production will far exceed 20 million shi. Then, not only will we not have to eat foreign rice, but we can also export the surplus to foreign countries. Therefore, once the rice tariff is levied, even if the import of rice is reduced or not imported at all, it will certainly not hinder the people who eat rice. This is another great reason why the rice tariff should be implemented.</p>
<p>(C) The question of whether rice prices should be increased. Some people think that once rice tariffs are levied, I am afraid that domestic rice prices will gradually increase, and consumers will suffer losses. The people who benefit may not be farmers, and the small farmers who buy rice to make a living between spring and summer may suffer even more. This certainly has a considerable reason. However, although there are no precise statistics on the proportion of the production cost and price of rice in various provinces in our country, the income and expenditure are generally just enough to offset each other, and there are even losses. As for the sharp drop in rice prices this year, farmers are losing money, which goes without saying. Assuming that rice prices continue to fall for a long time, who would be willing to plant rice again next year? Therefore, rice prices should be raised appropriately. However, once rice prices increase, foreign rice will take the opportunity to enter. Therefore, on the one hand, we must find ways to increase rice prices, and on the other hand, we must levy a small tariff to prevent the increase in rice imports. Moreover, comparing the prices of agricultural products with the prices of other commodities, the prices of agricultural products fall faster and more; conversely, when they rise, they are slower and smaller. This phenomenon exists in European and American countries, and it is also the case in our country. It can be understood by checking various statistics. In this regard, rice prices should also be raised a little. Therefore, it is only natural that rice prices will increase after the tariff is levied. If it is said that farmers may not benefit from the increase in rice prices after the tariff is levied, this is due to the failure of the food management law to be properly implemented, not the problem of the tariff system itself (the advantages and disadvantages of this are quite complex and will be discussed in detail in the future). What should be paid special attention to is that although the percentage of the import volume of rice to the national consumption volume is very small as mentioned above, the import of rice since the founding of the Republic has greatly increased compared to the Tongzhi and Guangxu years. In recent years, there has been a tendency to increase even more. If we do not levy tariffs and allow free imports, if there is another bumper harvest this year, I do not know to what extent rice prices will fall, and we will follow in the footsteps of British wheat and Japanese cotton. This is another reason why the implementation of rice tariffs should not be delayed.</p>
<p>From the above items (A), (B), and (C), there is no doubt that our country's rice</p>
<p>tariffs should be levied. Even the National Food Conference convened by the central government last year passed the principle of levying tariffs on grains. However, the new tariff implemented on May 22 this year still exempts rice, wheat, and wheat from import taxes, except for flour, which is subject to a tax of 25 cents per dan in gold units. What does this mean? Is it because Guangdong and Fujian need foreign rice to supply and not levy taxes? As mentioned in the various items in this article, even if the adjustment is proper, there is no fear of not having food to eat. Therefore, my proposition is that import of rice and grains should be taxed, but first, we should conduct a detailed survey of the price difference between foreign rice and domestic rice over the years, and investigate the production cost of rice and the living expenses of consumers, formulate standard prices, and compare them with the recent prices of foreign rice, and set the import tax rate according to the principle of protective tariffs. On the one hand, rice and grains in various provinces should be absolutely freely circulated to adjust surpluses and deficiencies, so that no province will suddenly run out of rice and have to rely on foreign rice. It is also necessary to find ways to increase rice production as soon as possible and strive for self-sufficiency. If we do this, the protective tariff on rice can be maintained permanently. If not, I am afraid that this tariff will have to be withdrawn once there is a rice shortage. This is the most important thing to pay attention to! Regarding this issue, I had proposed it twenty years ago. I am repeating old things, and the rice tax is still pending in the future.</p>
<p>This article, with over ten thousand words, elaborates in detail on the causes and consequences of the fall in rice prices and the issue of rice taxation, and is truly a masterpiece. However, due to the limited space of this publication, it cannot be fully published. There may be omissions that affect the meaning of the original work, so please pay attention to the reader!</p>
<h3>Changes in Rice Prices Over the Last Five Years</h3>
<p>— Editor: Zhou Wenjie</p>
<p>Grain is the main agricultural product. Farmers rely on it for national taxes, local levies, and their livelihoods, while the public depends on it for sustenance. Therefore, the volume and price of grain have broad and significant implications. In recent years, rice prices experienced a gradual rise in 1928 and 1929, followed by a severe decline in 1930 and 1931. As the time approaches when the old harvest is depleted and the new crop is not yet ready, the storage of rice remains a burden. If this year's grain growth is favorable, future grain prices will likely remain depressed. Farmers' sole product, grain, is already worth little, and other commodities such as silk and hemp are also struggling. Moreover, everyday necessities that were once made and supplied locally are now being displaced by new industries and imported from urban areas to rural villages. This is why the rural economy is bankrupt and farmers' lives are becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major metropolis that relies on external sources for food, but it is also a hub for domestic and foreign grain transportation. Its market's prosperity or decline and price fluctuations affect both domestic and foreign markets. This article, based on grain price statistics from the Municipal Social Bureau, examines these changes to illustrate the hardship faced by farmers and merchants and the distress of the people due to the wild fluctuations in grain prices over the past five years.</p>
<p>In 1928, grain prices remained relatively stable, with no significant impact on farmers or consumers. The average annual price of japonica rice (calculated per picul, the same applies below) was 11.17 yuan, with a maximum of 12.02 yuan and a minimum of 9.91 yuan. The average price of indica rice was 9.32 yuan, with a maximum of 10.09 yuan and a minimum of 7.98 yuan. In 1929, the average annual price of japonica rice rose to 13.51 yuan. October saw the highest price at 16.28 yuan, while April saw the lowest at only 11.34 yuan. The average price of indica rice was 12.55 yuan, with a maximum of 14.90 yuan and a minimum of 10.89 yuan. Compared to 1928, the difference between the highest and lowest prices for japonica rice was 6.37 yuan per picul, and for indica rice, it was nearly 7 yuan. This was due to a sudden disaster affecting the rice crop in 1929, leading to a price surge when the new crop was released, an unprecedented occurrence. In the spring of 1930, influenced by the poor harvest of 1929, rice prices continued to rise, increasing by 1 to 2 yuan per picul in January and February compared to the end of 1929. Since the summer, various provinces experienced continuous rain disasters, leading to extreme panic in the grain market. Despite the import of large quantities of foreign rice, prices could not be suppressed. The soaring rice prices in the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang caused widespread anxiety both domestically and abroad. In June of that year, the average price of japonica rice in Shanghai reached 20.05 yuan, with actual prices exceeding 24 or 25 yuan per picul, nearly double the average price in September 1928. Prices remained around 19 yuan in July, August, and September. After October, with a bountiful autumn harvest, rice prices suddenly dropped. The average price in December was only 11.84 yuan, a decrease of more than half in six months. Such wild fluctuations were rare. Farmers had to use two piculs of new rice to compensate for the price of one picul during the lean season. This loss alone was severe. The average price of indica rice also reached its highest point in June of that year, at 18.72 yuan. After September, prices fell from 13.06 yuan to 11.32 yuan due to the abundant new crop and the influx of foreign rice. The difference between the highest and lowest prices exceeded 7 yuan. From January to July 1931, rice prices were very low due to the abundant autumn harvest of 1930. The average monthly price of japonica rice fluctuated around 12 to 13 yuan, with a minimum of only 10.63 yuan in April. The average price of indica rice, however, experienced an abnormal reversal, with prices in February, March, and April being higher than those of japonica rice, likely due to temporary supply and demand factors. After August, prices gradually returned to normal, but widespread flooding in rice-producing provinces along the Yangtze River caused panic, and rice prices surged again. The average price of japonica rice increased sharply to 16.3 yuan, while indica rice reached 14.58 yuan. Compared to July, prices rose by more than 3 yuan per picul in one month. After October, a significant change occurred. Foreign rice-producing countries such as Annam and Siam had abundant harvests and aggressively dumped their surplus grain abroad. Domestically, in the aftermath of the September 18th Incident, tensions with Japan escalated. Japanese merchants, who had taken advantage of the severe floods in China to stockpile large quantities of grain in Southeast Asian rice-producing countries, suddenly devalued and sold off their holdings. Subsequently, the domestic autumn harvest, although affected by floods, was not as severely impacted as anticipated, leading to a drastic drop in rice prices. Consequently, the average price of japonica rice in October was only 14.07 yuan, while indica rice was 12.65 yuan. In 1932, the January 28th Shanghai Incident suddenly erupted and lasted for four months. Although statistical data was interrupted, rice prices at the time remained stable due to mutual support and regulation among the public. In May and June, during the lean season, the average price of japonica rice was still around 14 yuan. After July, with sufficient domestic grain reserves and a flood of foreign rice in the market, prices continued to fall, creating the lowest prices in nearly a decade. The price in July was 13.90 yuan, in August it was 13.70 yuan, in September it was 12.32 yuan, in October it was 10.92 yuan, in November it was 9.69 yuan, and in December it was 9.10 yuan, a difference of twice the peak price in June 1930. The decline in the price of indica rice was similar to that of japonica rice. The average prices in May and June were 12.83 yuan and 12.99 yuan, respectively. After July, prices also consistently declined, falling from 11.70 yuan to 8.57 yuan. Since the spring of this year (1933), grain prices have remained low, and with the change to the market picul (which is smaller than the original sea picul), market prices appear even lower. A chart of the daily average prices of japonica and indica rice over the past five years is provided above for reference. (The chart is omitted).</p>
<p>In recent years, China's food production has been affected by frequent national disasters, including floods, droughts, and pests. Provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, which were originally the most productive rice-growing areas in Central China, have been unable to maintain stable agricultural production due to the use of military force by communists, sometimes even requiring assistance from foreign rice imports. Even in Shanghai, where foreign rice imports were historically minimal, 1930 saw more than 7 million dan (a unit of weight) of foreign rice imported due to shortages in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, in 1932, foreign rice imports reached an unprecedented 22.48 million dan, valued at over 11.9 million gold units. Only 3.97 million dan were imported into Shanghai that year, suggesting that the majority was shipped to Guangdong and Fujian. Why did Guangdong and Fujian require such large quantities of foreign rice when rice-producing areas along the Yangtze River reported low grain prices? There are two possible reasons: (1) After hearing about the severe floods in the Yangtze River region in 1931, Guangdong and Fujian were concerned about insufficient domestic rice supplies and ordered large quantities of foreign rice in advance. (2) Due to banditry and the fear of disruption to coastal areas, Guangdong and Fujian, being coastal and grain-deficient provinces, needed to stockpile rice in case of a blockade, to prevent starvation and social unrest. In essence, the global economic downturn, which reached its peak last year, resulted in low prices. Asian rice-producing countries had abundant harvests, and the Republic of China, with its large population and lack of trade barriers, became the only destination for foreign rice. This is why our rice prices are so low, and foreign rice continues to be imported in large quantities despite the low prices. This is a cause for deep reflection.</p>
<h3>Recent International Wheat Trends</h3>
<p>— Zhide</p>
<p>Since the decline of agricultural products in our country, imports of rice and wheat have become increasingly important. However, with a relatively good autumn harvest last year, there was no need to order white rice. The development of mechanized flour milling industry and the lack of domestic wheat supply, covering only four to five months of demand, necessitates the import of foreign wheat. From August-September of last year to March-April of this year, the amount of wheat ordered totaled about 1.2 to 1.3 million tons. Recently, the overseas wheat market has undergone drastic changes, which are closely related to our country's flour and wheat industry. To clarify the situation for those within and outside the industry, this report, based on the information provided by the Hezhong Company, the actual sales of manufacturers, and recent trends, is presented below. Although the information is somewhat outdated, it is still a matter of international trade that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In the first half of March, due to the increasingly tense situation in North China, there was little development in terms of orders. However, the situation became slightly more active in the second half of the month, with approximately 60,000 tons of wheat being traded, including 40,000 tons of Argentinian wheat, 8,000 tons of Australian wheat, 4,500 tons of Canadian wheat, and 7,500 tons of Silesian wheat. Because import duties were added on foreign flour, North China proactively purchased Canadian and Australian flour in preparation. However, in April, the situation in North and South China changed. Due to disappointing news about the US wheat harvest and Roosevelt's policy of maintaining silver prices, speculators worldwide became enthusiastic, causing prices in Chicago and Canada to increase daily. However, there was no rush among Chinese merchants to place orders, with a total of only 41,000 tons being ordered, including 33,500 tons of Argentinian wheat for shipment to Shanghai and 4,000 tons of Argentinian wheat and 4,500 tons of Australian wheat for shipment to Qingdao. This was because previous orders from six months earlier were arriving, and the new domestic wheat crop was about to be harvested, so there was no need to place new orders. In May, the prices of foreign wheat continued to rise. Shanghai manufacturers were unwilling to sell at high prices amidst the domestic economic decline, and they still had approximately two to three months' worth of wheat from previous orders. Therefore, although foreign firms were selling, manufacturers were not interested. The trends in the world's major wheat markets are summarized below.</p>
<p>Canadian wheat prices experienced significant fluctuations. Due to exchange rate issues, it often could not be imported into China. However, it was very popular in the US market. In late March, there were a few transactions in Shanghai because the exchange rate favored imports, but afterwards, there was no further activity because it was still restricted by the exchange rate. However, in terms of the wheat that had already arrived, its quality was high, and manufacturers mixed it into their production (which was very popular among users). The price fluctuations on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange for March, April, and May are listed below (in Canadian dollars per gold unit):</p>
<p>(chart follows)</p>
<p>Five Month July Month October Month</p>
<p>March 1 ·48000 ·49000 ·51125</p>

<p>The development of Australian wheat has been quite noteworthy recently. Approximately one million tons have been ordered by our country from last year to now. However, farmers there are only interested in selling their surplus. Recently, everything has been sold out. Not only is no one selling, but even if there were, it would only be at the highest price. Moreover, the local market is purely independent and has little connection to the price fluctuations in the US and Canadian markets. As for its quality, based on what Shanghai manufacturers have received, it has thin skins and white color, so the flour yield is better than other types of wheat. Its weight is between 62 and 63 pounds. However, South Australian wheat is of lower quality, with a standard of only 60 pounds. The quality of Australian wheat over the past three years, measured by weight per bushel, is listed below:</p>
<p>(chart follows)</p>
<p>1930-1931 1931-1932 1932-1933</p>
<p>New South Wales 59.5 lbs. 61.5 lbs. 61.75 lbs.</p>
<p>Victoria 58.5 lbs. 62.75 lbs. 62 lbs.</p>
<p>South Australia 60 lbs. 61.5 lbs. 60 lbs.</p>
<p>Western Australia 62.5 lbs. 61.75 lbs. 62 lbs.</p>
<p>When Chicago wheat prices were around 46 cents, North American wheat had a good chance of competing in China and the world. However, with the recent price increases, such a scenario is unlikely. The main reasons for the price increases are the anticipated poor harvest this winter, the reduction in yields, and the complex interplay of political changes and economic problems, all of which are driving up wheat prices. Based on Chicago prices, with a price of 60 pounds per bushel, the prices are listed below (in US dollars per gold unit):</p>
<p>(chart follows)</p>
<p>May Month July Month September Month</p>
<p>March 1 ·47625 ·47875 ·48750</p>
<p>March 16 ·53875 ·53875 ·55000</p>
<p>March 30 ·52750 ·53500 ·54000</p>
<p>April 1 ·54500 ·55000 ·55625</p>
<p>April 17 ·60875 ·62375 ·63750</p>
<p>April 29 ·70750 ·71875 ·72750</p>
<p>May 1 ·70750 ·71875 ·72750</p>
<p>May 16 ·72500 ·73625 ·74625</p>
<p>May 25 ·70375 ·72125 ·73875</p>
<p>Argentine wheat also plays an important role in the world. Its annual production is approximately 6.3 million tons, with exports of approximately 4 million tons. Chinese manufacturers have paid little attention to it, but this year, it has been particularly cheap, about 10-20% cheaper than Australian and Canadian wheat at the time. Its standard weight is between 60 and 63.5 pounds. However, this Argentine wheat has recently arrived in Shanghai, and manufacturers have found that its grains are finer and lighter, significantly different from Canadian wheat. Therefore, the high volume of this wheat may not be suitable for Chinese manufacturers. The first ship of Argentine wheat from Bahia Blanca in 1932-1933 took 49 days at sea, and its natural weight was 75.2 kilograms per hectoliter, approximately 60.3 pounds per bushel.</p>
<p>Based on the above trends in world wheat production and the state of domestic wheat production in our country, Chinese flour mills cannot maintain production without foreign wheat supplies. China, which has been known as an agricultural country for thousands of years, and is a country of vast land and abundant resources, now relies on the world for its primary food supply. How will those in power remedy this situation?</p>

<h3>Where to Settle Down?</h3>
<p>— Tianli</p>
<p>"Chinese people are unfortunate Chinese people." This seems to be a pre-"destined" fate. Just look around: those living in border areas are bombed by enemies, and those living abroad are "expelled" (the wealthy are naturally excluded).</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen "bandit suppression" victory reports, Sichuan war news, and the retreat of North China's anti-Japanese troops to "pre-determined defense lines" in the newspapers. However, it is also worth noting that over four thousand overseas Chinese in Mexico have been deported back to China, and more than twenty thousand are expected to return eventually. In the eyes of the great and powerful, this is naturally a trivial matter. After all, if you lose your homeland, you can still live in "villas" abroad and will never be "expelled." Not only will you not be expelled, but you will also be treated as a "state guest."</p>
<p>The "unfortunate fate" of Chinese people seems to have been "destined" for a very long time. It is not something that has only been plucked from a three-stringed instrument recently. Let's ignore the four hundred million or so "A Dou" (a derogatory term for someone incompetent) in the country who are fortunate enough to sit in "cars" (referring to those in power) and not care where the "driver" (the government) will take them. Let's calculate how many years of "tomb luck" (bad luck) the one thousand one hundred thirty-three thousand five hundred (according to a 1932 survey by the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission) "refugee Chinese" have already gone through, and how many more years they have to go.</p>
<p>In a society that values settling down, with no assistance from the government, simply to escape natural and man-made persecution, overseas migration has created the great achievement of "ten million" people. Unexpectedly, we have been given the honor of being second only to Norway. However, these ten million heroic pioneers of our nation have endured great hardship and undergone rigorous selection. In the process of migration, relying solely on natural struggles, the old and weak who were not suitable were mostly eliminated. Those who made it to the forefront were all outstanding individuals. The successful result is the remittance of tens of millions of yuan back to the motherland each year. Under special circumstances, there were even "patriotic donations." Consequently, the central government established an agency specifically for receiving donations from overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>But the "unfortunate fate" of Chinese people is ultimately "destined." If you do not have "British" or "American" citizenship, then this "unfortunate fate" will cover you both at home and abroad. Those living abroad can expect to be beaten by foreigners' whips and guns. The massacres of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia by the Spanish on several occasions are well-known historical facts. And the two massacres during the Tokyo earthquake and the Korean riots are still fresh in our memories. Because of the global economic recession, the last straw is always broken on the backs of Chinese people. The expulsion of overseas Chinese and the refusal of Chinese laborers to disembark have become common news items in daily newspapers. And what about our government? Aside from a diplomatic document in foreign affairs, all that remains is a message of condolence for these warriors who have been defeated in the national economy. The wise government has the opportunity to send special envoys to explain the "anti-foreign" rumors to foreign bigwigs, but has no time to argue about the fact that overseas Chinese are being "rejected."</p>
<p>Now, we can still retreat to "pre-determined defense lines" in military affairs, but what about the economy? There is no defense line to defend. The state of a semi-colonial economy is more depressed than that of a colony. Therefore, these pioneers of the national economy, who have been forced to retreat, have no room for activity in the stagnant atmosphere of the motherland.</p>
<h3>The Emerald Ring</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Teacher X, who has never spoken Chinese and only speaks English in the classroom, has obviously lived abroad for too many years, so he can't speak Chinese! He speaks English very fluently, and he also uses English to annotate the names of all the students in the class when he takes attendance, which shows that he cannot read Chinese characters. Yet he is indeed Chinese.</p>
<p>Usually, in the classroom, he treats the male students with a stern face, but he always has a kind of smile that he dares not overdo with the female students. Perhaps this is his respect for women and disregard for men, and he has his own unique views and purposes? No wonder the male students are angry and do not like him!</p>
<p>How strange! One day, when he came to class, he was suddenly seen wearing an emerald ring on his hand; there is nothing strange about wearing a ring, but what is strange is that this ring was worn on the index finger of his left hand. As a result, it attracted the attention of all the male and female students in the class. In our knowledge of love and pursuit, we all know that wearing a ring on the index finger indicates that one is unmarried and is in the process of pursuing the opposite sex, so unnecessary thoughts naturally swirl in everyone's minds, perhaps because of the impulse of curiosity or the burning of jealousy?</p>
<p>"Doesn't he have a wife yet? He looks like he's around forty years old."</p>
<p>"There must be a reason why he's wearing an emerald ring on his index finger today!"</p>
<p>"We should pay attention to him and investigate the truth!"</p>
<p>"Is he thinking about our Angel?"</p>
<p>"Looking at him, he doesn't look like a weasel trying to eat swan meat! No way!"</p>
<p>Because of the discovery of this emerald ring, no one could hear what he was saying in this class. From beginning to end, the students' gazes were all focused on his ring. Some were silently thinking, and some were discussing in whispers, all their attention focused on the ring problem.</p>
<p>When he walked into the classroom, the first female student to spot his emerald ring was suspicious of him and told the other female students, and then all the female students paid attention to his ring, as if the purpose was to wear it for them.</p>
<p>After class that day, the male and female students had a big discussion, and everyone's face was filled with resentment. Nameless jealousy was burning hotly in the hearts of the male students.</p>
<p>"Damn it! There must be a reason for his ring today."</p>
<p>"Ah! He's going to pull this kind of performance!"</p>
<p>"We should guard against him!"</p>
<p>"According to my reason, our female students will never be seduced by him!"</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily a foregone conclusion!"</p>
<p>"I knew he wasn't a good thing!"</p>
<p>"Bastard! He's also pursuing our..."!</p>
<p>The above is the discussion of the male students after class. That day, the male students went to the dormitory and no one was in the mood to read or study on their own, and they were just discussing this issue.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the girls' dormitory, they were also chatting like this...</p>
<p>"His ring naturally means that he is not engaged."</p>
<p>"It is said that he went abroad from a young age, so he can't speak Chinese. Maybe it's because he was abroad that he hasn't married yet."</p>
<p>"He looks three parts like a ghost and seven parts like a human. Who would want to marry him!"</p>
<p>"If he wears this ring again next class, I won't go to class!"</p>
<p>"What does he take us for!"</p>
<p>"He just wants to...us!"</p>
<p>"It's really outrageous!"</p>
<p>"A ghostly face, he's too overestimating himself!"</p>
<p>The conversations in the girls' dormitory that day spread to the ears of the male students the next day, and people's hearts settled down a lot. Everyone was saying...</p>
<p>"Our female students are all very knowledgeable!"</p>
<p>"Everyone is sacred and inviolable!"</p>
<p>"He's just wasting his efforts! Haha!"</p>
<h3>What is Life?</h3>
<p>"What is life?" This question often swirls in my mind like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>I remember not long ago, I once had such a discussion with a friend. Because this friend was newly immersed in the sea of love, he firmly believed that life was all about love.</p>
<p>"What exactly do we seem to be born into this world for?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Ha! Your question has a very rich philosophical color!" He couldn't help but laugh; but then he answered me with a serious face; "You may not believe what I say; not only you, you can say that all those who have not been involved in love will not believe it! Do you think it's too intense? No! I absolutely believe in the phrase 'Love is a sacred medicine'. What career? What creation? These are all lies. Do you think so? For example, life is a body, and love is the soul; without the soul, there is no intention to manage any great career. So I say that life is all about love!"</p>
<p>"Then, when you wake up from your dream, you may laugh at today's thoughts."</p>
<p>So we stopped talking about this issue.</p>
<p>Another time. I remember raising this elusive and unanswerable question with another friend. However, the result was to replace love with "money"; the reason was to believe in the four words "money is omnipotent". Of course, this did not satisfy me; however. Apart from these two answers, no one told me a third new answer. Therefore, I still blindly lived in the world all day long.</p>
<p>However, I believe, and I believe with all my heart; life is definitely not just about pursuing money and love. In the future, something that contains a great comforting power will be born on earth, its power can break a dozen boring lives, and create unlimited light! At this time, guns and cannons have been abolished, the world has been united, and all people live in peace, without quarrels or disputes, but I don't know if we have the blessing...</p>
<p>This is just my dream! The question "What is life?" still swirls in my mind like a whirlwind all day long!</p>

<h3>Shop Assistant Correspondence</h3>
<p>Serving as an Accomplice to a Tiger</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am a junior staff member of a large candy company on Nanjing Road in this city and now request that you answer the following questions.</p>
<p>Today, the company's senior executives (directors) held secret discussions to build a residence for the general manager, whom they described as hardworking and meritorious. The funds for this will be forcibly borne by the staff and workers of the company's main store and branches in this city and other locations, as well as the factory. Each person will have one-tenth of their salary deducted each month for a period of five months. Mr. Editor, what are your thoughts on this news?</p>
<p>It is pitiful that we laborers have already sold our entire bodies and minds like commodities; what we receive is only enough to maintain life. Now, these so-called magnates, heartless and disregarding the lives of others, still cruelly devise ways to plunder us. Mr. Editor, how should we deal with this!</p>
<p>The struggle of one person is powerless, so I want to unite and stand on a single battle line to resist. However, we usually have no organization, and it is not easy to suddenly come together to deal with this already occurring event. Mr. Editor! Should we submit? Should we resist? I am hesitating!</p>
<p>In this situation, I want to state the reasons why I cannot afford it to the directors on the one hand, and explain the advantages and disadvantages of this move to the general manager and request that he find a way to stop it; but they are colluding with each other. Mr. Editor! Do you have a solution? I eagerly await a reply. Sincerely, Xu Shangda.</p>
<p>Editor's note: "Reading Mr. Xu's letter makes one hate the capitalists' henchmen who serve as accomplices to tigers. In many situations, we can often see that the capitalists themselves, although their hearts cannot be questioned, still have some concerns on the surface and dare not act recklessly in every way. Only these henchmen, because they want to fulfill their dream of being promoted to capitalists, flatter the capitalists wholeheartedly; on the one hand, they use their authority to exploit the laborers; on the other hand, they send signals to the capitalists. As a result, the laborers are indeed the first to bear the brunt and be slaughtered; but the capitalists, if they are not careful, create a huge storm, lose big for small, like a dog eating pork lard wrapped in bamboo bows, unable to explain themselves. Therefore, this kind of scum is simply a pest of society, and simply a fuse for labor-capital disputes. I regret that I have no power, otherwise I would definitely send one of them to the guillotine. Dear laborers! In your struggle, they are your first targets; as long as these people exist, don't even think about having a good day. Wise capitalists! Don't think that they are your loyal servants, their motives are entirely for themselves; once something goes wrong, they can shirk responsibility! Quickly see through their treacherous schemes, quickly drive them away. Then, in China, where production is backward, you will have your place, otherwise, I am afraid you will become the target of public criticism.</p>
<p>Therefore, we strongly support Mr. Xu's desire to appeal to the manager; but we believe that it is unnecessary to state your case to the directors, as it is useless and harmful to seek skin from a tiger. Rise up and attack these objects together.</p>

<h3>The Life of the Five Geishas (21) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hong</p>
<p>Eighteen · Autumn</p>
<p>Time flies so quickly, in the blink of an eye, it's autumn again.</p>
<p>Our Miss Liu is indeed a sentimental poet. She leans by the window, gazing at the ginkgo tree stretching over the wall, almost scorched yellow, quietly listening to the autumn wind sweeping through the treetops, and inevitably feels the icy coolness on her body. If cold rain were added, she would inevitably paint a bleak picture in her inspiration. So she involuntarily hums the line "The autumn wind and autumn rain make one sad." From this, it can be seen that Miss Liu has indeed increased her knowledge a lot in recent years.</p>
<p>Minister Su Gengyun has been in a really good mood lately, and today he pestered her for a long time again. Now, seeing Miss Liu standing by the window in a daze, he can't help but tiptoe up behind her, put his hands on her shoulders, and say in a low voice...</p>
<p>"Why are you standing here silently? Are you thinking about something again?"</p>
<p>"Thinking about something? Don't make me laugh. I'm not some high-ranking official, and I don't need to worry about national affairs. What worries could I have?"</p>
<p>"You're mocking me again, you sharp-tongued girl. But you need to know that national affairs and the worries of young ladies are not the same, and national affairs don't need you to care about. But the worries of young ladies are always heavy, cherishing people in the scenery, composing poems about the wind and moon, these are naturally the elegant and romantic affairs that are a young woman's duty. But I don't know which person you're thinking about right now?"</p>
<p>Because he mentioned this, the heroic figure of Zhang Wenbin immediately surfaced in her mind, so she couldn't help but twist her mouth and say...</p>
<p>"Is there any need to ask? Of course, I'm thinking about you."</p>
<p>"Thank you, but I don't think you're really that kind. I'm afraid you're thinking about that big guy, Gu..."</p>
<p>"Bah! How can you say that?"</p>
<p>"That's what you say, but I always feel a little uneasy. Hey, let me tell you something serious, would you officially marry me?"</p>
<p>"Marry you?" Miss Liu really found it a bit funny. "Are you really saying that? But don't you already have four, including your first wife? Isn't that enough?"</p>
<p>"You can't say that. Let me tell you; for example, my wife, you know, she's already old, and besides playing a few rounds of mahjong, she can't do anything. A woman being old is indeed not a big deal. The second one is Japanese, and she has to personally handle a lot of correspondence, and she's busy from morning till night, so there's no fun in the bedroom. The third one, to be honest: she comes from a humble background and can only accompany me to sleep. The fourth one goes without saying, she's too young and doesn't understand anything, and sometimes she cries for her mother behind my back, which is really ridiculous. And my two daughters are all grown up now, and their mother is worried about them and won't let them go to a girls' school to study, so they still have little education and don't know how to socialize, so they'll inevitably be unable to stand their ground in society in the future. So I often think like this; if you could come to my house, that would be great. Not only would my daughters be able to be educated, but even I, the old man, would be able to sit with you all day long, chatting and laughing, which would be the happiest thing."</p>
<p>"What a flirtatious old man, I didn't expect you to be in such a good mood." Miss Liu couldn't help but laugh loudly; "But how do you know that I have to marry you?"</p>
<p>"How can you say that? If you were a little more loving to me, then I think..."</p>
<p>Miss Liu laughed again. Before long, the twilight of autumn had quietly crept up again.</p>

<h3>From the Song "Spring River Flower Moon Night" to Emerging Music (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ren Xida</p>
<p>The music in "Spring River Flower Moon Night" (Tell me tonight) mostly adopts important parts from two Italian operas, Boheme (by Puccini, 1858-1924) and Rigoletto (by Verdi, 1813-1901), and cinematicizes them in terms of performance form, rather than bringing the entire stage opera to the screen.</p>
<p>But why, in this year of 1930-something, would we still be enamored with songs from the 1880s? It's best to first discuss the development of music in the last decade.</p>
<p>Although "jazz" music had already flowed from black people into the so-called civilized United States before the European War, after this so-called civilized United States industrialized this primitive music, the inherent dance music of Europe and the United States, One step, advanced into the current Foxtrot. However, due to the outbreak of the European War, people in society were living in deep water, so this kind of dance music had no chance to become popular. After the European War, American industry gradually developed, and "jazz" also developed with the development of industry. After 1924, the economy of Europe also gradually showed prosperity, and the power of "jazz" therefore penetrated into Europe.</p>
<p>Each era must have the art of each era. The industrial era will inevitably produce music that praises and exaggerates the power of machines. "Jazz" was born in this era, so the characteristic of "jazz" music is that it is "organized" and relatively "popular." Later, because of the deeper development of capitalism, the form of "jazz" music also advanced from "Foxtrot" to "Samba," whose characteristic is to completely describe the sound of train movements. However, this kind of pure mechanical sound is ultimately too simple in musical form. It is not enough to express the prosperity of capitalism. So "Charleston," "Black Bottom"... various forms followed. The ambition of this kind of tune is to "mechanize" all things in the universe, animals, and human movements, to show the greatness of machine power! So when "jazz" music at this time really entered a state of madness, the entire European and American society was anesthetized by this bourgeois music, especially the petty bourgeoisie, who were even more severely anesthetized. Many music students and composers took "jazz" as a career, and naturally "jazz" became "commercialized" and lost its artistic value. At the same time, since "jazz" had penetrated into the petty bourgeoisie, most of the "jazz" gradually became "petty bourgeois." However, despite this, the bourgeois musical characteristics of "jazz" still exist strongly. Until 1926, this bourgeois "jazz" music was called the peak flowering period.</p>
<p>From 1927 to 1928, although machines were still developing vigorously, capitalists were showing serious crises in industry and economy, and their status was gradually shaken. Then this kind of music representing the "flowering era" of capitalism is of course not suitable for the era of current society. So this kind of declining, sad "Blues" and passive, sentimental "Tango" tunes developed gradually in response to the times, and were able to suit the emotions of the times and penetrate into the psychology of ordinary people in society. It occupies a considerable position in the development process of "jazz" music. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Review of "Broadway Bad"</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Walking out of the Nanjing Grand Theater, what surfaced in my mind was the directing technique of "Broadway Bad." Indeed, this film is devoid of interest in terms of meaning and performance. Only the exquisite and transcendent art is worth savoring.</p>
<p>The plot of this film is very simple... It tells the story of a showgirl who is about to marry a rich man, but unexpectedly has a falling out with him due to a temporary misunderstanding, and she falls in love with a director in the dance troupe. Later, the rich man takes the four-year-old child born to the showgirl as his own and sues her in court. After the showgirl vehemently defends herself, the court's verdict still awards the child to the showgirl, and the case ends, and the script ends inexplicably.</p>
<p>The film is titled "Broadway Bad," but there is no love in the content, only carnal desire, only the love of mother and child, the showgirl's vehement explanation of everything is only for her son, and she is not moved at all by her old lover, the rich man. At the same time, the film does not describe anything about the personalities of the rich man and the dance troupe director, the two male protagonists. Of course, all their actions are sudden in the eyes of a third party. How did the rich man fall in love with the showgirl in the first place? The director uses money as a stepping stone for courtship. The character and personality of both of them make people extremely suspicious. Joan Blondell, who plays the showgirl, is very good, especially at the end, her tearful, bitter smile leaves an unforgettable impression on people, and her other emotions such as surprise, joy, anger, and false smiles are also very moving. She is the only focus of the whole film, and the other characters are bland and unremarkable. The male lead, Ricardo Cortez, is usually a very good actor, but here he is so stiff, he can only be called a "handsome wooden man."</p>
<p>The scenery is very unique, and the angle of the camera makes it feel very beautiful. The lighting is also very good, and close-ups (special shots), medium shots, and long shots each have their own charms. Many of the borrowed special shots are extremely humorous. The on-screen explanations are clever and commendable.</p>
<p>The director is the only hero of the film. He knows how to be clever and win the audience's laughter. Although many places are to avoid difficulties and take the easy way, and are lazy, it is not annoying, but feels pleasantly convoluted, and small interludes are his proud forte. For example, describing the intimate shape of a pair of lovers, he uses a blown piece of paper to describe it, and he uses the human head of the brass knocker on the door to compare the hideousness of the rich man's face. These are all places that make the audience yearn for it. The organization is deliberately scattered, and then a clue is found from a tangled mess, making people clap their hands and exclaim in admiration.</p>
<p>If you are an art lover, then this film is quite suitable for your needs, especially film industry workers should go and see it.</p>
<h3>Review of "Humanity"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>If we do not deny the sophistication of American film performance techniques (although these techniques are only suitable for their own ideologies), then the performance of "Humanity" is worth boasting about.</p>
<p>The director has a deep consideration of the old Montage, so in terms of mood, it is indeed very compact from Dr. Mao's treatment of the girl in danger, all the way to Ead. Of course, this is the focus of the play, and the first half is just a necessary accompaniment, so the director narrates it with short shots, but it is not too loose. However, in the back, that kind of quiet and beautiful picture and tense air are the result of the director's hard work. The most noteworthy is when the girl is in the emergency room. Two more children and a dog are added to stare beside her, making this tense picture vivid, from which it can be seen the director's painstaking efforts. He is also very attentive to all small occasions, such as blocking the light with a newspaper in front of the poor man's sickbed. He is even very particular about lighting and scenery. In short, the director is very successful.</p>
<p>Regarding the performance, of course, both Dr. Mao and his son have their own achievements. Ralph Morgan, who plays the father, has a full grasp of the personality of "Humanity," and the true feelings of a loyal and kind elder are revealed in every move. However, his facial expressions are always lacking, for example, when the detective arrives, he can only express his nervousness in his tone. As for the two female roles, they are both mediocre, and the one who plays the doctor's assistant is not very skilled.</p>
<p>However, this film has a significant shortcoming, that is, the old doctor dies too quickly and strangely. This is the fault of the director and screenwriter, and strictly speaking, it is unreasonable. However, we should not have too much extravagance for this kind of film.</p>
<p>As for meaning, this kind of film is very opportunistic for the real society. A good doctor must empathize with the poor and sick with a compassionate heart, which is considered to be loyal to his profession. As for the law, of course, it must be obeyed, so the young doctor repents after committing a heinous crime. Because of this, the selfless law can not hold him accountable. That's all.</p>

<h3>Movie Stars Enjoy Poor Life</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Because of the increasing number of thieves in Hollywood recently, Hollywood movie stars store all their property in the bank to avoid accidents, and they have to use temporary checks to withdraw money, so one day they were invited to enjoy the life of poor boys.</p>
<p>This day, American banks encountered a special holiday, and all the banks in the country were closed, and the banks in Hollywood also took a day off. In the morning, the newspapers in Hollywood were delivered to the homes of the stars, and the big headline on the newspaper read that the banks would be closed today. Several stars with empty pockets were all complaining. Hollywood became a poor world on this day, and many stars frowned.</p>
<p>Al Jolson happened to have no money in his pocket, and immediately borrowed money from a rich friend. Jack Oakie was so anxious this day that he almost couldn't afford breakfast. Shevley happened to run out of gas in his car and borrowed two dollars from his servant to buy gasoline. Stuart Owen couldn't borrow money and went home to steal his child's piggy bank. Panghor Hokins came out in a car, but he didn't have a dime on him. Later, he ran to Paramount, and a gatekeeper at Paramount happened to have received his salary a day earlier and had a few dollars left, so he lent it to her. Ginger Rogers couldn't even pay off her six-dollar and nine-cent debt. Lily and Hismen dumped out all the money in their wallets, and there was only one dollar and three cents. Roland Young went to eat, but he didn't have any money. Fortunately, he was familiar with the restaurant, so he wrote an account and ate a meal on credit for a day. Dawi Mannar also had only two dimes and seven cents left in her wallet. The newly arrived British star in Hollywood, Weila Angie, didn't know that American banks would be closed on this day, and didn't withdraw money in advance, so she was also empty-handed. There were also Zoling Crili, Eileen Deng, and Gary Croft, etc., whose meals were included in the hotel, so they didn't have to pay in cash, but small accounts were required. On this day, they all wrote IOUs to the waiters.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Grand Theater's Aviation Dance</h3>
<p>In addition to showing Pescaden's "Photography King," the Zhejiang Grand Theater specially hired a full class of dancers to perform various new-style dances, and in order to promote aviation to save the country, a "Aviation Dance" section was added. During the performance, airplanes rise and fall, the national flag flutters, and the words "Aviation to Save the Country" are written in large characters, which is both timely and can promote the patriotic thinking of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Overview of Soviet Russian Films (2)</h3>
<p>— Written by Rudolf Messner, Translated by Bao Han</p>
<p>In Russia, film is regarded as one of the most important parts of an all-encompassing plan for ideological education. The so-called ideological education is the education within the communist philosophy. The Soviets have realized the great power of film in education. Therefore, whether it is on the lips of young women or in the people's congress, every time the word film is mentioned, there is a solemn and dignified declaration. What these Soviet women or congressmen have realized is no different from what our country's young women or congressmen have also realized; what is different is that the Soviets have taken strict steps to preserve the educational power hidden within film, so that it is not covered by other things, which is what people inside and outside our country's lower house have not yet had time to consider.</p>
<p>Within the Soviet Union, the so-called education is of course a matter that is very synonymous with propaganda. Since the facts are like this, it is not surprising that we can see that the products of the Soviet Russian film production studios and the films shown in cinemas are nothing but propaganda films. (The import of foreign films will be discussed separately later)</p>
<p>It is our European custom to walk into a magnificent theater, and to seek a fun of entertainment and relaxation under the dim silver light, so when we suddenly encounter this harsh attitude, we are easily amazed. Just imagine, if there is no Laurel and Hardy, no foot of the Western wilderness, no sight of Tesduri galloping in the gravel, and even Garbo is not seen, what will become of this scene? Only propaganda, propaganda, and what is the meaning of propaganda? Europeans who enter Soviet Russia will ask in bewilderment, "Where shall I go to seek some light entertainment?" Russians will be able to tell you without hesitation, "In the circus! In the dance hall! In the park for educational recreation! You can seek it wherever you go. If you want to seek entertainment in the cinema, that is just wishful thinking."</p>
<p>Because in the minds of the Soviets, the propaganda power of film is extremely important and must not be allowed to fall into decline, or to diminish its strength in empty and meaningless entertainment. And the Russians may also ask you, "Is it true that our propaganda films have no entertainment value at all?" In fact, the best films such as "The Golden Mountains" also have quite a bit of entertainment to be found; the next best ones such as "The Black Black Skin" are not necessarily so; and then descending to third-rate films such as The Quiet Don, there is absolutely none (to be continued)</p>
