<h3 id="c17">統制經濟的問題 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 存</p>
<p>最近上海紗業因棉業統制委員會爲穩定紗價起見。曾限令交易所於本年十一月至十二月拒收客戶廠商新交入之棉紗。致引起軒然巨波事後復由棉業統制委員會於本月十二日宣布辦理此事之經過。以吾人觀察。此實爲全國經濟委員會成立以後進行統制經濟中所不可忽視之一事。</p>
<p>現代一般資本主義國家之先進。如德意英美諸國。關於國家經濟設施。自近數年以來。類無不採取積極干涉之政策。是即經濟恐慌發生後。歐美各國高唱統制經濟口號之所由來。而究其目標。不外乎在抬高成穩定　價。以恢復社會之繁榮。論其手段則千頭萬緒。計算週密尤無不以適合國　爲前提。旣未可以隨意效　而妄冀意外之收穫且其恐慌發生之　　根本上似另有眞確之原因。非僅此一問題。能挽救也。</p>
<p>若以我國今日之國情而言所謂統制經濟計劃之前途。殊不易於樂觀。第一。政府財力疲乏。目前中央收支不數。年逹二萬萬左右。政府自身之費用。旦不易維持。何來餘力以救濟今日之恐慌。欲求如歐美各國政府之斥資平凖物價。操縱匯兌動逾億萬者。固非可語於今日之中國也。第二。我國金融努力之薄弱。亦無可諱言。目前金融業之地位。旣受工商業連年不景氣之障碍。又以外國銀行金融資力之集中。而無法以謀自救。倘當局僅倡統制經濟之運動。而無實力雄厚之金融組織。以宰制全國國民經濟之運用。則其結果。恐不過徒糜經費而已。第三。外國商品之傾銷。亦一大障礙。年來國内不景氣之瀰漫。實由於重要商品之銷場日狹。遂國生産過剩。而所以招致生産過剩之原因。則如東北市塲之損失。内地農村之破産。外國工廠之發達諸端。皆爲其顯然之事實。而尤　外貨人口之增加爲不可漢視。今當局者誠欲謀物價之穩定。經濟之統制。秘須先使外國工廠之生産。與夫外貨之輸入。受適宜之調節否則所謂統制。徒爲他國之利。以成傾之尾閭。而於我工商業及大　。殊無絲毫利益也。</p>
<p>故我人所望於今日之政府。欲謀統制經濟之進行實現物價之穩定必須確立全盤新年之計劃　　可。不能僅着目於數萬包存紗之收軿問題。而當於紗價低落之諸原因。力籌根本救濟同後可。</p>

<p>此層說明之後、吾人有權聲明、吾法當本此妥恊精神、以求解决軍備平等權問題、德國根據七年十二月十一日英法意三國之宣、以要求軍備平等權、須知軍備平等、必以安全爲之交換條件、始能實行、此兩事至相關聯、缺一不可、乃德國僅要求軍備軍等、而置安全於不顧、此非法國所能承認者、如此片面之軍備平等、不惟法國拒絶、即上年十二月十一日宣言簽字各國恐亦不承認也、</p>

<p>事業不能脫離社會，而電信之使用，更與民衆有深切之關係。値兹政局漸趨清明，當局力圖建設，電信事業，爲建設之重要部分，在發展期中，應社會之需求，深覺有公開討論之價値。本社同人，抱斯志願：關於電信，建設之消息，行當盡量探聞，俾社會得明眞相，關於電信興革之言論，行當盡量貢獻，俾當局知所採納。其餘電信常識，電信技能，以及海外電信事業發展之近况，我國電信事業最近之統計，亦必充分豋載，藉以介紹於羣衆，而社會人士，對於電信之使用，苟有意見，一經刊佈，更可爲從事電信業者他山之助。總之，以「電信」公諸社會，以社會之力，促電信事業之開展，「電信公開」，意即在斯。因於發刊之始，擷此四字，以爲之辭。</p>
<h3 id="c88">統制經濟與電信 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 王運楨</p>
<p>自瀋變發生以來，世界經濟恐慌怒潮横决於太平洋東西兩岸，我生産不足工業未興交通未備之國家，首當其衝！吾人内察國情，外顧環境，非統一不能禦外侮，非建設無由紓民力，首由汪精衛氏發表「以建設求統一」之宣言，繼以宋子文氏擬具「以經濟救救國難」之計劃，於是改組經濟委員會，冀以統制經濟方法，充實國力，打開内外夾攻之局面，實爲我國今日環境許可下惟一之救國政策。</p>
<p>何謂統制經濟。我國學者聚訟紛紜，吳逹銓先生曰：「統制經濟者，各個國家在其國某種經濟主義之下，平時或臨時，爲某種目的作成一種整個有系統之經濟計劃，在某種經濟組織中，而以其國家統治之權力施行之是也。」穆竊初先生曰：「統制經濟之界石，即在於從動摇到安定，從經營到管理，從不知到已知，此爲經濟發展之主流，亦即爲一切經濟人所不斷努力之點，且亦即爲統制經濟之前路？」鄭獨步先生則認爲統制經濟，即係國家以恊調國民生活發展國家經濟爲目的，對於國家經濟行爲的總體，加以合理的統制，而掃除經濟行爲上的矛盾與衝突，根據以上三說，可得一個結論：所謂統制經濟者，即一個國家在某種經濟環境之下，爲安定國民生活，救濟經濟恐慌，調恊國家生産起見，使用國家的力量，而制定一種經濟計劃，以求社會經濟之平衝是也。</p>
<p>我國是否需要實行經濟統制？因不必遠溯管仲之治齊，商鞅之治秦，王安石之治宋，已具統制經濟歷史上之權威。試讀總理實業計劃一書，以發達國家生産爲目的，即統制經濟之根本原則。又依據本黨第一次全國代表大會對内政策政綱第十九條所規定：「凡企業含有獨佔的性質，爲私人所不能舉辦者，如鐵路航政等由國家經理之」。所謂企業含有獨佔的性質，係指交通事業或公用事業而言。電信爲交通事業之一，關係一國政治軍事經濟文化各方面甚鉅，故我政府早於二十五年以前，（清光緒三十四年）從商辦之手，收歸國營，立法善，但二十五年來，電信事業，日趨衰敝，且嘗有種種矛盾與衝突的事實發現，此非電信就制之咎，實統制不力之咎。</p>
<p>電信統制之關係於法律方面者，有十八年八月五日國府公布之電信條例，同年十二月公布之民營公用事業監督條例，十九年五月八日核准之無線電材料進口護照臨時辦法。十九年一月三十一日行政院通令京内外各機關取締私設電台，及二十二年七月七日核准交通部委託省政府代辦長途電話原則。由交通部公布者，有十九年十二月二十四日之商辦海底電綫豋陸取締規則，及二十二年十一月二十四日民營廣播無綫電台暫行取締規則。細讀種種條文，均含有統制經濟之意義，立法旣嚴，主權自重，顧事實又如何耶？</p>
<p>查海　登陸，關係國家主權，非經所在國政府之許可，外人無私自設置之理。我國自清同治四年，（一八六五年）英人雷伊那地由上海至吳淞口架設陸線，已開喧賓奪主之漸，厥後同治十年，（一八七一年）大北電報公司私在上海架設海底電綫，以南與厦門香港北與長崎海參崴接，即以電線借我國使用爲條件，清廷許之，爲外國公司海綫登陸獲得法律上之承認，於是有種種水綫豋陸，及借用接綫合同，水　登陸專利合同，滬烟沽水綫代設及代辦合同，沽津平買借綫合同，借欵合同，報費合同之訂立。條件苛刻，備受束縛，致對外通信，無從發展，差幸各種不平等條約，業已滿期，經交通部兩年交涉之結果，已於今年四月簽訂新約，挽回利權不少。然謂主權完全恢復，則不敢輕信。此國際有綫電報未能施行統制政策之證明也。</p>
<p>國内有綫電報，在北京政府時代，電局爲地方軍人把持之機關，局長爲其夾袋中人物，中央不過照例任命而已。國民政府成立，耳目爲之一新，但以種種關係，軍人割據形勢，未能全然打破，粤桂川滇黔各省電報局長，均係地方軍人所任命，報費收入與各種表册，多未賚呈交部審核，因政治未能統一，斯電信　期統制者也。</p>
<p>國内無綫電報與電話，雖歸交通部主辦，但蘇浙皖魯豫湘鄂粤桂等省建設廳，亦興辦省有長途電話，使用通話電報，與交部爭一時之利，或藉口軍事通信，設立短波電台，暗中收發商報，亦屢見不鮮，至租界中外僑，或外國領事館，設立電台，傳遞消息，尤爲破壞我國主權。均應設法取締，以收統制之效</p>
<p>夫統　經濟，莫利於發展交通，而發展交通，莫便於整理舊業，計劃新猷。我國電信有五十年之歷史，二萬以上之專門人員，苟整理，擴充之，實較各種交通事業爲局，而其功用，實握各種交通事業通信之樞紐，必須制定電信根本法令，將行政上之基礎：撥付一部份之棉麥借欵，爲經濟上之基礎；然後統一電信組織，訓練幹部人員，以統制經濟爲原則，而利用技術合作之方法，擬定十年或五年電信實施之計劃，持以堅恒，務求貫澈，如此，仍謂中國電信事業，不能收統制之效，吾不信也。</p>
<h3 id="c89">電話之幻象回綫與交义　▲簡單的說明 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 觀</p>
<p>前閱報載，據說「京滬長途電話，爲發展起見，新架電線四條，並使用幻象交叉。該項工程，已在進行中，明年幻象話綫之組成綫路</p>
<p>新春，即可通話」云云。所謂幻象交叉，讀者或多未能明晰；而京滬長途電話，使用幻象回線，究有何種利益，想亦爲讀者所欲知，因就本刊篇幅，作一簡單的說明如次：</p>
<p>何以謂之幻象？在說明者應先加以解釋。物旣可稱爲幻，似乎實際上虛無所有。若更以「幻象」爲名，則形象所示，或聲浪所佈，疑非其眞，似可引起一般人之誤會；但在電話使用上觀察，「幻象」乃係一術語Phantom。用一幻象回線（回線即組成電話雙方通達之線路），即本來有電話線兩對者，今用此種方法，可增加至三對用處，線條不必增加電流感應</p>
<p>，而同時通話，乃能增多一次。所謂幻象者，自己通話，並無專設之線，乃利用旁的電話對線，接通組成，通話非祗眞確，且更清晰，不過名稱定爲「幻象」而已。</p>
<p>欲明幻象回線之接通情形，可參觀下列之圖。圖中間之雙方通話，即爲「幻象回線」，與上下兩話機之各佔一對電線者，一目了然，自屬不同。</p>
<p>電線丨不論其爲電報電話丨架在同一木桿上，很能引起相互間之感應。此種感應，即普通人所謂雜音。譬如在電機聽話之時，聞及電報拍發之聲，或旁的人通話之聲，皆感應也。欲减少或免除感應，在電信方面，使用一種線路交叉。法於每隔幾根電桿，將線條交叉一次，此係所稱普通交叉。或使用上述之幻象回線，則因線條之數較多，故交叉之方法，亦隨而有異。本篇祗簡單說明，如何交叉，始不詳述。</p>
<p>讀者可閱下圖。上面原有電線，因電流經過，發生感應之電在甲乙兩線上。此種感應電，上下不同，因交叉之故，可使正負互趨於消失。因之雙方通話，亦可減輕影響。我國交部所辦長途電話，及此次京滬路使用交叉，無非使通話者之得傳聲清晰，無殊晤對，其理由即在於此。</p>
<h3 id="c90">一年來電報業務之改進　（上）　劉駿祥 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>電報爲公用事業之一，關　業務方面，亟應力圖商業化，以予各方通訊之便利。顧我國昔日辦理電政者，每以電報局係國家機關，視爲仕宦之一途，因循萎靡，泄沓成風，遂致四五十年來，未見有長足之進展；而内容之腐敗，尤爲社會所詬病。近來交通部爲整頓起見，在商業化原則之下，亟謀電報業務之發展。對於原有之各種弊竇，痛予改革。一面將歐美現行之良好辦法，儘量採用。計一年之内，改進之成績，已斐然可觀。兹擇其犖犖大者，列舉如左：</p>
<p>（一）免費代譯來報，按各電報局於接收或投送之電報，向例由發報人或收報人自行繙譯，其有要求電局代譯者，須繳納譯費。惟事實上，各收發報人除機關或大商家外，備有電碼本者，實屬無多。如係發電，尚可請由電局代譯。若係來報，則收報人於收到電報後，再行持赴電局，請爲翻譯，延誤事機，勢所難免；且我國現在電報應用之範圍，甚爲狹溢，一般民衆，事非急迫，不發電報，收報人於接到未曾繙譯之電報，其焦急當爲何如？交通部原訂有代譯來報之辦法，惟日久玩生，各局台每多陽奉隂違。兹特重申前令，並規定漏譯處罰辦法：凡華文明語來報，除政務新聞賑務公益各，電報曁在報務繁忙地點其收報人係商行之電報外，均由電報局台免費代譯，如查明漏譯，負責人員，應受每字罰銀一分之處分，同時在各報刊登廣告，俾衆週知，以防局台之有意取巧。嗣後收報者於收到電報時，立即詳知其内容，　免翻譯之煩，復無類外耗費，其受益誠非淺鮮也。</p>
<p>（二）收發人員改善態度　各局台收發員，與外界接觸最繁，而該項人員，待人接物，態度每多傲慢，問答每不問詳，且收費時各項輔幣之折合率，不免任意伸縮，深足引起發報人對於局台之不良印象，於業務之發展，殊爲一大障碍。交通部特訂定收發員値班須知一種，將收發員値班時，應注意應遵守曁應明瞭各項，詳爲規定，發交各局台，由主管人員切實督飭遵守。現在各處收發人員，多已態度廉知，偶有詢問，亦必盡情以告，原有之不良事項，悉經袪除，發報人感覺便利不少。</p>
<p>（三）設置業務稽查員　電報之章程手續，頗爲繁複，收發報人多有未盡明瞭之處，若不予以解釋，每因之發生誤會；且電報局台方面，業務上之缺陷，手續上之錯誤，自亦所難免，顧無傳達之機會，則一方徒生觖望之心，一方仍無改進之望也。交通部有鑒於此，特於各繁要局台，設置業務稽查員，專司稽查電報業務之責。每日親赴各發報商行，機關，團體，報館，通信社等處，查詢來往電報，有無稽延錯誤，各項章程手續，是否明瞭？有無不滿意情事？並注意私人華明來報，局台是否代譯？報差有無需索酒資各項？從此收發報人對於電報業務有未明瞭者，得有詢問之處，其有不滿意情事者，均得有正當之答復。無形中養成對於電報局台之好感，而在局台方面，亦得藉知缺點之所在，用爲改進之參考，誠兩利之道也。</p>
<h3 id="c91">法國廣播無綫電事業之進展　陳賢鼎 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>法國先進學者在實騐室之工作，對於廣播無線電事業，本多供獻。惟因法國人民，對於是項重要發明，不甚注意，以致法國廣播無線電事業，比較發達之其他各國，漸覺瞠乎其後。因此法國人民，現頗注意是項事業，以便仍行取得從前之優越地位。</p>
<p>查法國廣播無線電事業之最初創設，爲一九二一年十一月靄飛爾鐵塔軍用無線電台之放送。是項放送，最初僅係氣候報告，不久即有關於公衆經濟及尉政消息之傳佈。是後經過十二年之久，頗多重要改進之處。</p>
<p>關於無線電話之放送，是否應用爲自由性質，或專利性質？曾經成爲問題。一九二三年六月三十日之財政法，曾規定「一八五一年十二月二十七日命令所規定電報線路專利及警備辦法，應適用於各項無線電符號之收發。」至一九二六年十二月二十八日之命令，則訂定國營及私立無線電台之規則。一九二八年三月十九日之財政法，則規定政府有權暫行准許私立廣播無線電事業，以一九二七年年底所存在者爲限。惟如對於營業性質或辦法有所變更，則須經過特許，以免與廣播無線電事業組織法相抵觸。但雖在此混亂情形之下，私立無線電台對於組織方面，改進頗多，而經費一項，則除依賴其唯一收入之廣告費外，亦並無獲得國家何種津貼。郵電部職員最先創辦國營無線電通信網，除收取廣告費外，同時國家方面亦略加津貼。</p>
<p>關於法規方面，歷經各任部長計劃訂定。在馬丁氏任内，則曾規定一自由廣播之管轄區域（一九二九年五月二十八日）。最後，乃規定用國家財力經營廣播事業辦法。</p>
<p>現已預備用六千五百萬法郎以收買或設立各處重要廣播電台，作爲國營事業。而郵電高等學校則將加大天線電力爲１２０KW，以便利巴黎鄉村之聽衆。尼斯。都路斯及里昻三處之電台，則擬定爲６０KW。至其他數電台，亦擬加以改善。</p>
<p>本多司（在巴黎附近）之殖民地廣播城市電台，及阿爾其，拉白，西貢，各處殖民地電台，均已開放。此外尙有數處殖民地，亦將同様設立電台。</p>
<p>法國國營無線電通信網，在本國境内者，計有郵電高等學校，靄飛爾鐵塔，里昻，司德司堡，格倫諾婆爾，馬賽，寳多，蒙貝拉，雷尼，里爾，都路司，里慕治等處。</p>
<p>至私立電台，則已有兩家，准其增加電力。此外尙有法國無線電話公司之Ｒadio　Paris，則已由天線電力１７KW增至６０KW，可稱爲歐洲大電台之一。又電力總公司之Poste-Parisien。原由巴黎某大報館所創設，現亦已定天線電力爲６０KW,亦可與歐洲最佳之電台相競爭。其他尙有同様辦法，亦已决定。現在在法准許放送之私立電台，計有十十個。</p>
<p>一九二六年十二月二十八日之命令，規定國營廣播無線電通信網之技術方面，由管理財政及節止之機關處理之。但節目之安排及實現，則委托由下列民營事業辦理：例如無線電聽衆聯合會（專對郵電高等學校），無線電話總會（專對靄飛爾鐵塔）是也。現聞改善組織，業已成熟，進行自必迅速。將來法國廣播無線電事業，當更有長足之進展矣。</p>
<h3 id="c92">收回水線公司電報收發權之意義　禾水 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>英丹美三國人民以前根據與滿清政府所訂之平等電報合同，在我國領海内安設水線，並在上海分别設立大東，大北，太平洋三水線電限公司，直接收發上海與世界各處往來之電報。因其存在時期之長久，及宣傳招徠報務之努力，遂致上海人士腦海中，深印此三公司之名稱，而遇有致外國電報時，必赴各該公司發寄也。</p>
<p>兹因以前所訂之不平等電政契約，業已期滿，經交能部與各該公司嚴厲交涉之結果，於現在國勢財力環境之下，第一步將各公司直接向公衆收發電報之權，先行收回，當於本年五月一日實行接收三公司收發處。分别改組爲「交通部國際電信局大東，大北，太平洋水線電報收發處」，而處内關於電報之收發，職員之調度，及報差之管理等等事務，則均由交通部所派之正副主任，乘承交通部及國際電信局之命，負責主持處理。</p>
<p>水線公司直接收發電報權之收回，意義殊爲重大，因以後凡經大東大北太平洋三水線傳遞之來去華洋電報，均經我方之手，不能有一電之遺漏也。其最大意義，可舉左列各點：</p>
<p>（甲）保持我國電信主權。</p>
<p>我國電信爲國營事業，而由交通部主辦，其他任何機關均不能越俎代謀。外國商人，經我國政府之許可，並服從我國政府頒布之條全，在華辦理國際電報通信事業，雖無不可，即在歐美日本亦屬不乏先例，惟爲保持我國電信主權之完整起見，對於公司等直接向外界收發電報一事，决難令其長久存在也。（待續）</p>

<p>電報爲通信之利器，凡發寄者必須熟諳各項電報業務辦法，始能盡量利用，獲得電報之最大功效。我國民衆因平時發電之次數極少，故不甚注意各項業務辦法，而電局方面，亦少宣傳，致民衆無明瞭之機會。最近交通部刊行之明密電碼新編内，附載各項業務辦法，甚爲詳盡，凡備此一册者，可隨時查閱，實予民衆以極大之便利。惟該項電碼新編内所刊各項業務辦法，大都係各種電報章程之摘要，關於查問電報之手續辦法等，尙村闕如。兹爲便利民衆，並使電報之功效盡量發揮起見，特編撰「查問電報須知」一種，舉凡收報人或發報人對於查問電報時應具之常識，均經詳細臚列，以備參考。將來希望電局印成小册，分送發報民衆，俾熟知如何利用電報之方法，則於營業之發展，或不無裨　　（一）收報人查問電報須知</p>
<p>（一）電文發生疑義　收報人接到電報時，對於電文中某句或某字，因與全文意義不相連貫，以致發生疑義，或認爲某字錯誤者，可持來電向電報局查問。如該局查明並無錯誤，則可發納費公電向發報局查詢。此項納費公電，係按照所查之字數計費，例如查問一字，即須預付一字之報費。若查詢結果，該字確係發報局或中間局傳遞錯誤，所有預付之一字報費，可以如數退還。但如該字並無錯誤，或因發報人書寫模糊，以致誤爲他字者，此一字之報費即不能退還。</p>
<p>（注意）收將人因電文發生疑義，不用納費公電查問，而逕自發電詢問發報人者，雖所查之字。確係電局錯誤，其自行發電之報費及原電報費，均不能退還。</p>
<p>（二）電文脫落　收報人接到電報時，如認爲電文中有脫落之字句，可持來電向電報局詢問。如該局並未漏抄，則必係發報局或中間局脫漏，可發寄納費公電向發報局查問，查問之方式有二：（一）如認爲某字以下有脫落一字或數字者，可謂求將某字以下之一字或數字重行傳遞，（二）如全電脫落字句甚多，或全電意義不明者，可請求將電文全部重行傳遞。此項納費公電，按照請求重傳之字數計費，如請求重傳二字。即預付二字報費，如請求重傳電文全部，則照全部字數付費。若查問結果，確係電局脫落一字或數字，則預付之報費可以如數退還。但如重傳之數字内，有一字係電局脫漏，其餘各字均與原來電文相同時，祇能將一字報費退還。（待續）</p>

<p>宋氏首謂、政府此次能體諒本人苦衷、准予辭去政治上各職、俾專心致力於建設事業、私衷頗爲愉快、本人出國、在建設上與各國商就之合作計劃頗多、現决逐一繼續實行、經委會駐滬辦事處、自擇定地址後、刻正從事於内部組織、至於駐滬辦事處處長之人選、則目前尙未决定、</p>

<p>經委會現决添聘常委兩人、除孔部長祥熙外、另一人選尙未决定、棉業統制委員會、刻正積極進行、至於絲礦糧食各業統制委員會、須俟人選决定之後、即行成立、惟選擇人選、頗感困難、第一、須得社會之信仰、第二、須辦事有魄力、第三、須與政府能合作、除此三者之外、更須有時間、能專心服務、如棉業統制會主席陳光甫氏、曾向上海銀行請假六個月、俾得專心致力於棉業統制會之工作也、</p>

<p>經委會本身開支、月僅數萬元、而事業費則頗浩大、過去大部係均用於水利·道路建設·及衛生試騐場等、係由政府撥欵補助、今後之事業費、全部由美棉麥借欵項下支配、外傳政府於美棉有如何虧損事、完全不確、蓋政府對於美棉、俟其運到再出售、迨售罄後、方面美續運、而美麥又視國内需要、再向美國運來、今首批美麥、大約在年底或明年初、可由美運抵滬、總之、政府對於出售美麥有詳盡之策劃、斷不致稍受虧損、</p>

<p>新聲社云銀行學會、於前日下午七時、假座四川路青年會大禮堂、請中國銀行大阪分行經理戴藹廬氏演講、到各行會員三百餘人、由新華銀行經理王志莘主席、介紹戴氏登台、報告其在日半載及最近經過東三省及華北觀察之感想、語極警闢、兹誌其大意如下、</p>
<p>國難氣象　戴氏首謂、本人在大阪六月、此次返國、經東北平津青魯等、亦兩月、所受感觸最深者、即在日天天見到國難氣象、日本全國上下、羣以一九三六年將到而從事凖備工作、時時大聲疾呼、力渡國難、迨返抵國境、反覺國人淡焉若忘、毫無國難氣象、平津一帶、熙熙攘攘、吃喝嫖賭、一如平時、夫日爲侵略國、而朝野工作、均甚緊張、我爲被侵略國、反嬉恬如常、此令人最痛心者也、</p>
<p>少壯軍人　日本政治舞台上、少壯軍人派、甚爲得勢、現任陸相荒木、即少年軍人派之領袖也、至少壯軍人成派之原因、爲兵役法之改革、往昔徵兵制、國民無論何人、均服兵役兩年、今則工農等仍服兵役兩年、中小學生在校時、入青年訓練團、受嚴格之軍事訓練、與正規兵相同、入大學後、不受軍事訓練、但畢業後作一年之志願兵、此輩大學畢業生、因在中小學時、已受長期訓練、故不復作士兵、最低亦授以少尉階級、復從志願兵中挑選其優秀者、送入陸軍大學肆業、故陸大學生、均爲大學畢業生之優秀者、不僅長於軍事、對政治經濟社會諸學、莫不有豐富之學識者、故今日之軍人、其頭腦不復若昔日舊軍人之簡單、但此輩軍人、在日本資本主義之經濟組織、已臻於完成而鞏固之時、實無用武之地、以發展勢力、放寖假而有九一八侵佔東北之舉、今日少壯軍人派、正努力以滿洲爲根據地、努力建設一新勢力、在經濟組織上、完全放棄日本國内現存之制度、而守铨出於統制、其將來之結果如何、固不可知、但國人不能不明瞭其成因與趨勢也、</p>
<p>統制經濟　在日本境内時、有非常時之呼聲演講播音及報章論文、鼓吹非常時之凖備、如財政外交國防等等、幾無</p>
<p>日無之、除鼓吹之以外、實際上亦日在進行、我國報紙間雖亦有一九三六年、危機之論文、然除此以外、即别無所見、如統制經濟、我國亦有論述者、然僅論述而已、絶無實行之可能、在日本則政府對企業之統制、如管理國外匯兌、限止銀行分設等一一實行、而三井銀行等、亦以深感政府壓迫之甚、最近因日美日俄戰爭之將臨、已將轉入戰時管理時期矣、</p>
<p>對外對内　至言及日本財政、則同様剜肉補瘡、其困難情形、或有較我爲甚者、然與我大不相同者、即我國軍人政客、往往借對外問題以從事内爭、在他國則對外吃緊、正所以恊調内部、消泯私見、此最令吾人痛心、而不能自已者也、次述怕懼與輕視之心理、均不可存云云、</p>

<p>據吳氏談、調節糧食之重要、已爲國人所共知·現在國米價格慘落、實爲農材經濟破産之最大原因、本市雖爲銷售米糧之主要市塲、但内地米糧内運輸上之不便如一時需用多量米穀、事實上殊感覺搜集困難、故一般商人、往往有收買洋米之舉、此次蔣委員長在南昌行營、召集糧食會議、本市代表卽提出組織米糧産銷機關之計劃、擬請蔣委員長商請政府指定一銀行、透支現金一百萬元、再由政商界籌集現金一百萬元、俾在湖南江西等處、收買米穀一方面提高内地米糧價格、以救濟農村經濟衰落、一方面抵制洋米、藉以杜　漏巵、惟收集内地米糧來都市、在本市固可有一部分之銷售、並可運銷至廣州天津等處、蓋廣州天津二處、每年洋米進口、爲數甚鉅、若有國米接濟、則洋米當可滅少進口、且政府得實行整收洋米稅、國米價格較廉、銷路更可增加、但該項産銷機關、將由商人辦理、政府則從旁監督、並實有保持永久之必要、該項計劃大概、不久卽可由蔣委員長批復各代表、且各代表間在贛時、已有相當之接洽、故實現期當不在遠也、</p>

<p>吳氏復談及倉庫問題、謂本市前曾議及此事、卒以限於經費、未能實現、近中央曾通令各省市積儲米穀、其原因有三、（一）調節米價、（二）防範災年、（三）應付國際之變遷、其辦法、縣積儲一萬石、鄉積儲五千石、如以本市而論、人口之多、每月需米糧約在十萬石左右、而本市所有倉庫項下經費、所存者不過二十餘萬之不動産、且與蘇省所共有、故其數不敷甚鉅、現在本市方面、有主張凖備現金者、蓋如有現金、在本市收買米穀、非爲難事、且本市地價昂貴、如成立倉庫、需用大量堆積塲地、則事先又需購地之費、實感覺太不經濟、另有主張仍照中央辦法、積儲米糧、故此事尙須經一度商議後、方可决定云、</p>

<h3 id="c215">値得介紹的一種喪禮 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>我在濟南見過一家出喪，儀仗中間有一班高蹺戯，到了熱閙的十字街頭，一切停下來，看那高蹺戯的演藝。我幾乎認做一種賽會了。在蘇州時，常聽見愛瞧熱閙的人們，艷耀着幾時有某家的「盛出出棺材」，我竟不明白這種喪禮，是有什麽意義？和死者有什麽相干？</p>
<p>就是司喪，點主，開弔，公祭，排日的閙闊，親友們也是「徒　假焉」，孔老夫子所說：「食於喪家之側，未當飽也」。我正可惜他不生於今日，否則一定可以回回感到「旣醉且飽」。這種喪禮，是普遍在中産階級，好像不如此，便不能說遵禮成服。</p>
<p>現在有一家喪禮，却大大的殊異，不到鄉間去做墳打坑，把死者葬在安樂園。丨蘇州耶穌敎的公墓丨先一日下午二時，家祭，同時地方人士在他們家裏開一個追悼會。就是訃告，也狠别致，分爲親友象贊，誄文，哀啟三類，文言白話韵文新詩，兼收並蓄。</p>
<p>就哀啟中述及死者的懿德，有兩件事，値得介紹的，一是家庭圖書館的公開；二是先人紀念堂的設置。祖先忌日，廢去僧道拜懺諷經，不用紙錠冥器，只用鮮花一束，清香一枝，　着祖先遺像，陳列遺物，子弟們鞠躬致敬後，由家長詳述祖先的創業，和平日事蹟，大家靜默追念，打例，祭神如神在」的虛應故事的傳統禮節，這種斟酌中外融通古今的改革，我們未嘗不能想到，却總是没有勇氣去實行。</p>
<p>末了，我要說明這種喪禮的主持者是誰了。說起來，或者有許多人知道，就是做過東南植業銀行行長當選過國會議員的許傳明先生。他死了一個守節撫孤的母親，許家在蘇州，算得是富室了，要是「未能免俗」的話，至少要閙上好幾天的闊，豈知竟這般的簡單，不是値得介紹給虛榮充滿社會的今日之下麽，我還希望「以産業的一部，作一次鄉村合作的事情」。（見胡伯輪　象　）這句話，在最短期間能夠實現。那末他的孝思更偉大了。</p>
<h3 id="c216">記一個考生的自述 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>前兩天，余在某處席間，碰見了一位，從這一回高考自首都歸來的，像似乎新貴先生們：他的考名姓甚名誰，余向别一個朋友問得狠明白；但不便把他寫出，恐或者有傷忠厚的地方，這是先要聲明的；看這位先生表面，固自器宇不凡，異常漂亮，的確是一個時髦人物；所以談吐亦突梯滑稽，常使人失笑；然而免不了劉蕢下第，賺了英雄沮喪的態度，一時團聚而轟飲者，不下三四十人，他的一言一語，竟會令人側耳細聽，爲之寂然：亦可見這次考試，雖非是從前鄉會試，一般人羨慕虛榮心理，至今還没有兩様！</p>
<p>他說；這回我入塲，笑話自己眞閙得不少呢？我從前在某中學讀書的當兒，先生到教室裏，任憑你去講得大花亂墜，我終狠自在的看了一兩回小說：有時還一手撚花生米，一手剥良鄉栗子來滿口大嚼，有時率性曲了肱俯首睡了；待到鐘聲響起敲醒了午夢，吐沬直淌在檯板上面，怱怱的馭了幾本做様的小册子，又去上别課了；後來也居然考入大學，不過我懶讀書怕用心的程度，更加來得孟晋，一遇到反對考試，我終是首先提議，并且組織罷考同盟會和學校當局，拚個你勝我敗，這是不滿十年的事；不料到了現在，我非但不反對，偏甘心走進考場裏去討苦吃，這自己想想，也不曉得爲些什麽？</p>
<p>唉！我初起以爲這種考試，是狠便當的，那裏知道幾位典試委員們，題目出得異常艱深；就是單提一個國文題目，「入則無法家拂士，出則無敵國外患者國恒亡」，接到手時，眞想不起來，義士志士勇士力士，觀音大士，我的父親在本鄉地方，且做紳士，從未見過「拂士」，這「拂」字，你想敎我怎様講，而且像今日有了「敵國外患」，吾國准恐有亡國的這一朝，偏說「無敵國外患國恒亡」，或者「恒」字，當作「不」字解還可通，倘若不然敎我怎様動筆，還有什麽「黃巾」，「以吏爲師」，種歷史題目，都是胸中向來没有藏過：所以此次雖進了塲，呌名在場裏撒個屁，也可算替祖宗爭了一口氣，他說時，大有旁若無人眉飛色舞的架子十足，聽者皆吃吃作鷀鸕笑不置。</p>
<h3 id="c217">女人與酒 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>酒是人生的『慰藉品』，『興奮劑』。所以，詩人，藝術家，小說家，英雄，美人，……大概是没有不喜歡酒的，女人，也是人生的『慰藉品』，『興奮劑』，和酒有同様的效能。</p>
<p>酒的味，有一種的不同，女人亦然。天然風韻，嫻淑端麗的村姑，這猶如鑑湖本地自釀的花雕，都會裏不是没有清麗嫺靜的女子，已有些像酒家所沽的紹酒，裏面有些『水』的成分了。摩登女子，猶如皮酒，初開缾塞，泡沬突湧，煞是好看，非常成風，可是咀嚼其味，畢竟帶苦，怎能醉人丨鄉下女子，妝嫫費騰，東施效顰，好像白酒水，雖也有江北朋友，喝了要醉，究竟不能和花雕，京莊同日而語啊。至於白蘭地，威斯克等外國酒。我們喝不慣：或者别有風味，要讀討外國太太的留學生，獨嘗異味了。</p>
<p>從幾十元一瓶的外國酒起，京莊，太雕，花雕，菉荳燒，杏仁燒，　泉酒，……以至十四錢一斤的白酒水止；酒的種類，不計其數，女人呀，也是如此。『臭蝦配臭醋』『情人眼裏出西施』。酒能醉人，女人也能醉人，其性質功用，是一般無二的。</p>
<p>女人喝了酒，杏　暈霞，星眼盪漾，自然愈顯其美。酒能醉人，女人也能醉人，女人加了酒；當然囉，格外能夠醉人了。信陵君晚年『把醇酒』『婦人』來結束他的政治生活，英雄老去，無聊如此，傷心人别有難言之隱啊！</p>

<p>清早，路燈還在迷濛中吐出黯淡的光，一些灰塵在軍事軌上打着滾，巡捕給一層白霜蓋着縮在牆角裏，打一個呵欠，瞪眼瞧見一個，三跟在那副鮮魚兒擔後，伸手偷啦，挺大的一尾哪　　他可做意把眼兒閉上了。</p>
<p>太古公司門前階沿上，幾個捲着廣告紙睡着的流浪人，腦袋那兒照例有着一盒烟捲和一盒火柴，大火輪的烟打鐵筒子裏飄出來，飄到浦東那面天空上便淡下啦。那面的天空時必在泛出異色，深青的，灰白的，嫩黃丨虎黃丨淡紅丨漸漸的，漸漸地，一朶朶紫紅的朝霞伸出胳膊來啦。</p>
<p>站在浮碼頭上瞧，瞧一眼混濁的江流，眼兒便發花。</p>
<p>對岸建築物的輪廓慢慢兒打烟霧裏踱出來，那一排廣告牌後，便是高高低低的棧屋，朝霞便從那兒棧屋背後陞上天空去的，小半爿天給它染紅，江水也給它染紅，血様的衝來啦。</p>
<p>擺渡的船夫可還在夢中。</p>
<p>說不定，東方的天空就要炸裂了，瞧那嚴重的形態，迅捷的變幻。沿外灘的電燈都沉垂着眼竟不敢瞧　夜與　交替時的騷動。可是，太陽終於帶着一身子血跡出來了，俯瞰大地，驕傲地笑啦，兀的一抖，便掉下江去，掉得粉碎的，一片，一片跟着混濁的江流流去。</p>
<p>這時天上有了一個白太陽，電燈没用處了。</p>

<p>走在半路途中，殷得仁悄悄的握了趙自張的手道：你有什麽感觸嗎？趙自强道：我有什麽感觸？誰也都是一様！殷得仁摇摇頭笑道：我就不一様，你那話不能普通的說。到了這個時候，你才知道，還是做光桿兒的好了。田青道：我也是光桿兒怎麽就没有你那様快活呢。殷得仁笑道：你是誠心裝　吧？你這個光桿兒，准是光得乾乾凈凈的嗎？那位黃女士不是光桿上長的一朶波有開的花嗎？那開了的花不要緊，扔了就扔了。這没有瞧見是什麽顔色的，就丢開一邊，這可呌人是難捨難分囉！說着，他又拍拍趙自强的肩膀。他有什麽話說，也就只好朝着人家微笑罷了。關耀武在他們三個人身後，並不作聲，許多，却歎了了口氣。殷得仁道：老關你爲什麽歎氣。關耀武道：你們說什麽花兒朶兒的，我倒不理會我就是捨不得我那一窩兒孩子。殷得仁道：這還是那話，人是做光桿兒的好。你要是根本就是個光桿兒，那裏會有這様一窩兒孩子呢？四個人說着話，已經各回了連部。趙自强見燈光都亮上了，這就不敢躭誤，先跑到大廚房裏去，呌伙夫烙餅，一百多人一天的糧食，自然也就夠烙的。看了一會。這又回連部來，監督士兵收拾小行李，（註，即藥彈。）其間還上了兩回營部，和營長回話，這一晚上，可以說是没有睡覺。照着命令，乃是七點鐘在大操塲集合出發。趙自强五點鐘就起來了。怱怱的吃過了早飯，還不到六點。自然，士兵比他起來得更早。這個時候，雖然是日長夜短，然而五點多鐘，天上還不過是灰白色。（二四一）</p>

<h3 id="c220">平劇的靈魂研討 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 胡梯維</p>
<p>平劇之在今日，衰微末落，瀕於破産，這是不可掩的事實，於是就有人起來研究這衰落的道理，和復興的途徑。</p>
<p>有人歸罪於神怪蓮檯的戲的風行，可是觀衆要不上坐，戲園子裡就能一本一本往下排嗎？有人說是近年來電影侵入的結果。這好像說不是我的不好，都因爲人家比我太好了。這像話嗎？所以都不是對症的脈案。</p>
<p>據我的私見，目前平劇没落最大的致命傷，就是没有「靈魂」。比起　時來。就是袁子才所講的，性　。譬方說：眼前平劇界生旦的魁首，當然得推余叔岩梅畹華了。請這兩位名伶合演一齣南天門，凖可以轟動一時，上個滿坐兒。誰也得承認這齣戲是珠聯璧合。所謂容斯美矣；腔斯善矣。不過我要問一句：凡是見過他們倆的南天門的，你的心靈中也曾感到檯上的主僕二人一種顚沛流離之苦嗎？也曾爲這急急如喪家犬忙忙如漏網魚的曹小姐洒過一掬同情之滬嗎？要說是不曾，那末這齣戲等於没有唱，觀衆也等於浪廢光隂，一點得不到什麽。</p>
<p>這就是說百年前的戲劇，雖然是亂跳亂嚷的草台戲，它却一齣有一齣的忠孝節義的意旨能隱握着至高無上的威權，很普遍地印到民衆說腦筋上去。這一點，便是我說的戲劇的靈魂，現在的平劇慢慢的蛻化了，變做了少數的閒階級的消遣品，無論票友内行，一張嘴，不是說這個字是湖廣音兒，就是說這句腔是譚調或是余派，彷彿戲的能事，祗在唱，旁的都是枝節。我們要明白一個演員最緊要的功夫，是一登場先得抓住觀衆的情感，然後儘量發揮戲中的主義，觀衆便能夠得到正確的印象。演員如果抓不住觀衆的情感，無論昌的字怎麽正？腔怎麽圓。也不過電影中一張歌舞片，劇本若没有主義，便是虛空是朽腐，那都没有不歸於失。的。我們還得明白現代所需要的，决不是祗好爲有閒階級年當心悅耳的戲劇，而是能夠帮助社會敎育引導民衆的戯劇。所以除開梨園中爲衣食問題而研究戯劇的内行先生外，一切票友外行以至於對於戯劇曾有些微好感的民衆，都該起來擁護提創有靈魂的戯劇。</p>
<p>簡言之，每齣戯劇的本身，先要有健全的主義，每位演員，先要熟練富於刺激性眞切的内心表演。合此二美，方能不負這補助社會敎育的使命。現在盛行的單齣戯，支離割碎，實在要不得。我們一方應提創原有的整齣的好劇本，一方要編纂現代需要的新劇本，（如明末遺恨黑藉寃魂，都是有靈魂的劇本。）利用平劇中所特具的豐富情感，來輔助社會敎育，然後，我相信平劇才能永久生存着，不愛電影話劇滑稽等，它種游藝的淘汰。什麽一字一句的音韵學，一霎眼一洒鬚的小身叚，以至於一雙靴鞋或是一件藍白氅的服裝研究，我認爲倒是局部枝節問題，我們不妨放開一些再說。</p>

<p>— 仰莽</p>
<p>質地美丨價格廉丨服務周全</p>
<p>孟子曰：「諸侯之所寳者三，土地，人民，政事。」一日記者偶經南京路某公司，抬頭忽見高揭六個大字，因仿孟子詞意，得句云：句云：『記者曰，國貨之所寳者三，質地，價格，服務』孟老夫子的話，有朱老夫子來替他下註解，記者的話，只好老老面皮自己來解釋了。</p>
<p>（一）質地　從前有句話，「破儘破，總是杭州貨。」因爲杭州人製造貨品，倒有「杭鐵頭」的本色，很是頂眞。選道地的材料，用眞實的工夫，以求精美的出品，這是値得欽佩的。所以國貨工廠，要營業發逹，出貨流行，第一是在求物質精美。粗製濫造的，不是生意。改頭換面的，不是好漢。只求量的多的不求質的精，更不是製造家應取的方針。</p>
<p>（二）價値　質地好了，價格還要相巧。國貨有精良的質地，是國貨廠的本分。千萬不可因爲質地的美，便居爲奇貨，任意抬高價格。更不可因爲國貨年中大家提倡國貨，於中取利，趁火打刧，便把價格提得十分高昻，使愛用國貨的望而却步，或買而灰心。吾常常說：做生意當然要賺錢，要發財，不過要賺錢，要發財，不應當在顧客身上打量。還是要從製造方面用心。原料怎様可以便宜，人工怎様可以節省，消費怎様可以減輕，出品怎様可以增速，能夠在這方面用工夫，價格自能低廉，顧客自然雲集，銷路自然廣大了。</p>
<p>（三）服務　跑到一家公司去，誠心誠意，要想揀幾種國貨，却不道那班店員，懶洋洋，死板板，硬聲硬氣，問二句，答一句，問一句，答半句，好像没精打彩，不耐煩勞的様子，來對付吾，把吾的熱氣，換他的冷氣，那麽，吾即使抱了十二分愛用國貨的熱心，到此只好敬謝不敏，顧而他去了。啊呀！這般店員，是不是國貨和你有什麽怨仇？你忍心如此？吾問你，你吃的什麽飯？你對於你的衣食父母的顧客，忍心冷落如此，那麽，你還是回家去，伴你的妻，抱你的子，不用你住在國貨公司，來做仇視國貨的分子。有一天，馮仲卿告訴吾道：他的夫人，到一家公司裏，起初不想買東西，可是有位店員，東拿一物，西拿一品，說得生龍活虎，津津有味，馮太太稱心極了，連買了數十元的貨物，實在預算至多買二三元，有了這位服務週到的店員，便多買了二十倍的貨品做店員要這様才是稱職。可是話要說回來了，目下生活程度日高，一般店員，仰事俯蓄，處處覺得拮据，或者感於待遇的菲薄，因而做事不高興起來，其實經理都有眼睛的，你如果努力，將來一定不會吃虧，况且生意發達以後，公司賺了錢，做店員紅利一定不少，是在店員自己做去，怨天尤人，怠慢主顧，是誤人誤己，自取其咎。</p>
<p>國貨，談話</p>
<h3 id="c246">女人與國貨 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 慈雲</p>
<p>今年是國貨年，在國難聲中的國貨年。</p>
<p>一般布爾喬亞的太太小姐們，她們心目中，根本是没有什麽國貨的，一切所用的東西，都非十足道地的舶來品不可，以爲舶來品一定是好的，時髦的，這實在是一種亡國的心理。</p>
<p>國貨公司，登了極大的廣告，提倡國貨的先生們，熱心地極力喊着：「中國人用中國貨！」可是她們一點也不注意，專門在尋有什麽外國貨到上海。</p>
<p>窮苦的人，她們當然没有錢去買舶來品，就是價廉物美的本國貨，也没有錢去買，她們爲了生活，出買了勞力，整天到晚的在掙扎着，肚子不餓，已經極不容易，所用的東西舊了，破了，也只好媽虎的用一下子。</p>
<p>太太小姐們！應該爲了國家，爲了國難，打破這種虛榮的心理，抱着非國貨不用的宗旨，來實現自己，並且再勸自己底友朋們！也來服用國貨；那麽至少給舶來品一個極大的打擊，給國貨一個有力的帮助。</p>
<h3 id="c247">國貨的失敗在那裏？ <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>說起國貨年和事實相比擬，誰也不否認痛心之至，國貨年………祇不過好聽的名詞罷了？</p>
<p>然而：國貨何以會失敗至斯，絲廠關，洋米盛，綢銷滯，一切的一切，只看見洋貨様様抬頭，國貨呢！好似一個棄婦，躑躅歧途，試問：長此下去，這棄婦還有命活嗎？</p>
<p>探本索源，應該知道他的病根在那裏，明白了病根，然後可以對症下藥啊，據我所知，有下述幾端，</p>
<p>（一）是投機性　記得歐戰時代，絲，紗，廠風起雲湧，不管三七二十一的加速出品賺錢，出品好壞，不去管牠，資力厚薄，不去顧到，未幾，戰雲散了，絲，紗，廠一敗塗地，釀成今日至慘苦的現代，共他製造業，亦多存投機心理，欲事業之不失敗，；安所得乎？</p>
<p>（二）是無恒心　剏造國貨，一次失敗，就心灰意懶，咨嗟太息，無奮門的恒心，或者一種國貨事業失敗，再去改業别種國貨，並不想已失敗的，謀他最後勝利的念頭。</p>
<p>（三）是困於金融　錢莊老大，要放欵是揀不愁經濟周轉的所謂好牌面去放，去遷就主顧，若是遇到一位發明國貨，欲借欵剏造的人才，要想有貝之財，是談都不要談，即使已成偉大事業之廠家，市面好用欵多少還可以多少商量，若是遇到一落千丈，他們是拒人千里，不肯於危急中，助人一臂之力，而期待着復興，得到鼎盛營業，那般仁兄，目光如豆，並未想到自己本身也負提倡國貨的責任，這是國貨本有希望，而失敗在金融不接濟的很多…………</p>
<p>（四）是遷就性　國貨不好，應當改良，製造家萬不可不顧貨品，一味遷就客戶，致被人鄙視，即國貨好者，亦將受同一影響，終致失敗！</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>「提倡國貨，」「提倡國貨，」這運動已轟烈烈地舉行了好幾次了，但是，牠的效效果在那裏？牠所表現的成績在什麽地方呢？這是一個値得我們疑惑的問題丨</p>
<p>「提倡國貨，」爲什麽不能收巨大的效果呢？這裏面，原因固多，但在上者之不能以身作則，及國人藐視政令而不實行，却爲其中的主要原因，這是無疑義的！</p>
<p>現在，作者謹貢獻幾個辦法於後，如能確實施行，則國貨運動，必能有巨大之效果可言，而此幾篇文字，幾次開會，收效來得大些。</p>
<p>（一）政府當局，各機關公務人員，須一律服用國貨，違者革職。（無國貨可用者例外。）</p>
<p>（二）機關團體購用物品，須一律國貨違者須令購者賠償，滿至二次以上者革職，（此法日本行之，殊收宏效。）</p>
<p>（三）學校敎職員，服用品，須一律購用國貨，違者　職，　百　　不　用中國料。</p>
<p>（四）黨部工作人員服用品，須一律國貨，違者革除黨藉。</p>
<p>上述四者，表面視之，似太嚴厲，但如能切實奉行，則國貨運動，自有圓滿之結果，惟最要之點，是在政府當局，機關公務員，黨部辦事員，學校敎職員之能以身作則，然後庶有大效可收，孔子曰：「上有好者，則下必有甚者焉。」這是一個很好的格言。</p>

<h3 id="c250">國貨軋稻機之缺點及改良 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 朱枕木</p>
<p>前期本刊，曾有關於軋稻機介紹之一稿，兹記者更有關乎該機之缺點，及其改良言面，有所見地，願假本刊一角發表，然望製造各家加以研究而改良之，亦所以提倡國貨之一法也。試列舉其缺點及改良方法於后：</p>
<p>▲該機現有之缺點</p>
<p>該機之運動，連絡雖佳，然缺點尙屬不少，兹就記者如能之所及，加以判語：（一）該機前無遮攔板，於是軌下穀粒，散滿遍塲，收集復需費力。（二）軋下之穀粒堆中，因釘刺力巨，常有短細稻藁混入，分離不易。（三）該機除脚踏枝因槓桿作用稍可假力外，其圓桶之旋轉，亦未加借力之物應用，且必須兩人合作，同時踏動更覺不便。</p>
<p>▲改良方法之概要</p>
<p>根據上述之缺點，可改良之如下：</p>
<p>（一）在圓桶左端，加上一種量卅五公斤之飛輪，森質鐵製均可，直徑以一公尺爲宜，邊之厚薄則可隨材料而分别之，於是因惰性關係，可以帮旋轉，省力不少。</p>
<p>（二）於圓桶前裝置狐面護攔薄板，使穀粒不致飛散，而歸入盛器。</p>
<p>（三）旣加上飛輪後，一人之力儘可維持，不必兩人同踏，故可將機箱長度收狹，以六十公分即夠。</p>
<p>（四）於飛輪内檔，裝置長四十公分之扇翼葉子兩片，使順帶旋轉，將短稻藁吹出箱外，以代簸揚。</p>
<p>（五）如是增加飛輪葉子及木板後，機身以兼太矮　，則不妨在下墊以木箱盛器一只，其容積爲高六十公分，闊六十公分，長九十公分；適與改良後之機箱體積相等；則機件不用時，可將葉子，護攔木板，脚踏板等納入貯藏，而如兩只半桌然，可以挑動搬運，用時則横眠地上，可以盛穀，一舉數用，雖耗資較多，然其用正是無窮。且若卸下飛輪，而提倡國貨所須要的三項顆心　謝荻寒作</p>
<p>將兩箱相并，在經濟的家庭，加上桌面，即可作吃飯檯子，更爲便利實用。</p>
<p>以上僅就記者鄙見，願有識者加以指正，且望各鄉鎭之土紳，出資製造，務須求出貨之多，而不必計利息之厚薄，而有以振興農村之經濟，記者企矣。</p>

<p>— 胡厪文</p>
<p>上海小學林立，只要你肯到各處去跑跑，便可以看得見那藍底白字的○○</p>
<p>小學的檳榔牌，眞是觸目皆是，點也點不完，記也記不清。</p>
<p>這是一種好現象，因爲兒童敎育發達，便可以養成無數的良好國民，國弱可以賴以强，民窮可以賴以富；然而敎育兒童，必須有良好之敎師，然後兒童才有造就。譬如一塊璞玉，倘雕刻之技精，則玉才可以成爲有價値之元器，如果技術不精，胡亂捉刀，則良好的一塊玉，必被他弄得一文錢不値了！</p>
<p>提倡國貨，是每個國民的天職！而爲小學敎師者，尤必須認明本人是本國的國民，吃，穿，用，必係國貨，那末，兒童看見了，自然也仿傚起來，國貨的銷路，可以因此而增加，國家經濟的窘困，可以因此而寛裕，倘那般敎師們，不顧國家，不顧兒童，像紅樓夢上所說，個個都是「猪油濛了心覈」，居然穿非洋貨不可，用非舶來品不行起來；兒童看見了，也照様仿傚，養成虛榮和浮滑的習氣。那末，我人敎育家的一手造成者，僅不過一些「小洋奴」而已丨害國害民，莫此爲甚！</p>
<p>孔子曰：「正己正人」！我希望那般敎育家們個個以身作則，因爲兒童的模仿性最强，近朱者赤，近墨者黑，國貨前途，實基於此！</p>

<h3 id="c252">兩點小意見 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 黃玄萬</p>
<p>在這國貨年頭裏，我們關於如何推廣國貨，抵　舶來的問題，確實已曾高唱入雲，努力研討過，倘然，我們都能切實遵行的話，那麽或許也可說是已到了一個相當的階段，不過，在另一方面，我們又須再回過頭來，看看我們國貨工廠本身丨製造方面的進展如何？對於生産力是否已有合理的增加，成本方面是否已能獲到相當的輕减，出品的改良，售價的低廉，這些趨勢又如何？</p>
<p>誰也知道，現下是我國國貨事業最嚴重的轉變期，「東方的睡獅醒來了，」國貨事業的振興，這就是牠怒吼的先聲，看全國上下異口同聲的提倡國貨高潮裏，我們國貨工廠的突飛猛進，精益求精，關於過去外界推廣和廣告宣傳，旣是我們尙在萌芽時代新興工業的必要條件，那麽如何使生産改良，成本减輕，出品美觀，供求適應，促成工商繁榮，農村復興，自然尤其是爲他最主要之鵠的，現在我就有下列兩個問題，要謀切實的解决，並貢獻一些意見：</p>
<p>一·原料方面　因爲我國是生産落後的國家，所以原料異常缺乏，歷來國貨工廠的採用外貨原料，也確實是無容諱飾的事實，現在我們要具體解决這問題，就得儘量採用本國原料，已有者竭力提倡，未有者設法開辦，務　　　　　　期内，在外貨原料的　入上，無數字之表現，並且這也就是所以救濟失業工農和復興農村，</p>
<p>二·組織方面　一個企業的發展，自然首須内部組織之完善，國貨工廠的營業與製造兩部，就得首須聯絡合作，譬如以一家琺瑯廠來講，他的出品有面盆·口杯·飯碗·食籃·火油爐等幾大類，而在一類下，又尙須分出數十種不同的花色，所以，他的銷額方面，時序關係，所謂供求支配，也就在在需要嚴密的統計，某種貨物現下正可盛銷，但某種貨物必需式様的改良，……諸如此類的問題，就必須設業務聯委會，由營業，製造兩部關係人員組成之，或專設業務調查部，詳查市面情形，銷貨消息，情報兩部，專司其事，否則，營業與製造雙方時相隔膜，可不時發生某貨待銷，而貨棧缺貨，某貨銷路暫滯，而出貨浩繁，悉數屯積等矛盾的可能性，上期仰堯先生談洗冠生先生支配月餅的高材偉能，自然尤足爲我們的遵循。</p>
<p>總之，衆望所歸的國貨事業，終究尙在幼稚時代，它好似一個襁褓的小孩，還在在須要保姆者的盡職維護，若等到他的本身健全，大衆擁戴，「根固枝榮」那麽他的前程，自然未可限量呢！</p>

<p>— 寗自强</p>
<p>王老先生是遜清的老貢生，由他的那副老態龍鍾的容貌，活表出一副慈祥的顔钩。因爲王老先生有點道學先生的模様，人家都說他的思想落伍，稱他冬烘先生。王老行狂也欣然以冬烘先生自居，不以人家侮辱他，表示一點反感。</p>
<p>有一天王老先生講一段提倡國貨的話，給學生們聽，開宗　義的一句，就是：「尊王讓夷」。學生們聽了都對先生發呆，懷疑着王老先在這個提倡國貨的話中間，來了一句牛頭不對馬嘴的「尊王讓夷」的話，這豈不是和現在革命的潮流，有些背道而馳嗎？這豈不是十八世紀的思想嗎？學生摸不着頭腦，一個個望首先生。</p>
<p>好容易經過王老先生一番解釋，纔知道王老先生所謂尊王，乃是尊國貨之王：所謂攘夷，乃是抵制外貨的意思，學生們聽了纔恍然大悟。</p>
<p>自從這個消息傳到社會上以後，從前錯認王老先生是頭腦冬烘的人，現在都一變從前的悔辱，輕視，的態度，而爲尊敬，欽佩，的態度，並且從此以後，個個都認爲王老先生是一個人舊而思想根新的，不是十足的老古董。</p>

<p>— 鑑因</p>
<p>社會上跟着時代的需要，紙類的效用，益見偉大了。其中尤以報紙爲最。據海關之統計，每年由外洋輸入之新聞紙，不下關銀三千萬餘兩，漏巵之大，有加無已下近年朝野上下，莫不極力提倡自行製造，但報紙用途雖廣，而價値却甚賤，若非有産量豐富的原料，以及製造費的低廉，鮮不失敗者，報紙的原料，在西洋各國，皆以木製，因其森林多也。故國人每多考思，以他種比較産量多之原料以替代木漿。因爲我國森林缺乏，砍伐不易，最近杭州美利紙廠廠長杜時化發明，以稻草製造報紙，惟稻草向以製草紙，及紙板之用，别無他用，即使製作報紙，亦因其體質粗劣，不易漂白，難能化製耳。現經杜君用蒸解法試騐成功，確稱完滿，所製之紙，雖不及平常報紙之光平，但很可以兩面印刷，並且不會透墨，至於成本，較木漿低廉三分之一，約每噸凈白草漿僅百元左右，這様看來，稻草成爲新聞紙之原料，已屬事實矣，聞杜君現正籌備大規模之工廠，從事製作，以應社會之需求，並呈請省府轉實業部批准，給予專利十年，則於國貨前途當挽回不少利權也。</p>

<h3 id="c256">參觀生生牧場記 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 甘純權</p>
<p>上海生生牧場，位於大西路哥倫比亞路口，係三友實業社創辦人沈君九成發起開辦，迄今四載，設備清潔，用最新式蒸氣消毒，冷氣殺菌等機，規模宏大，信譽日隆，飲戶日增，記者頗歡一覩該場實况，昨承光君之招，駕自　汽車，來中華職業敎育社，偕往參觀，此行有姚惠泉何清鑑潘仰堯楊崇臯等諸君，兹記沈君談話曁該場概况如下，</p>
<p>（甲）沈君談話</p>
<p>上海全市新鮮牛乳營業，就中外人所　大小牧場總計之，年値三百六十萬元，其中以我國人所辦者合計之，年値一百二十萬元，僅及全市營業三分这一，险新鮮牛奶外，尙有罐頭煉乳及乳粉二種，按之煉乳及乳粉便於使用携帶及保存，且價較新鮮牛乳爲廉，故用者甚多，就上海全市論，合新鮮牛乳煉乳及乳粉三項營業總計，年値三千三百六十萬元，頗足驚人，沈君鑒於上海牛乳事業，多半　諸外人之手，利權外溢，銳意改進，沈君此志，同人至表同情。</p>
<p>沈君謂改進牛乳事業，必先注重養牛，有主張畜外國種牛者，有主張畜中國種牛者，就沈君主張，以畜中國種牛爲宜，其理由有三，（一）中國種牛，母牛一頭，每天可援取牛乳八磅，初次交配後可增至十二磅，此後二棚乃至二十餘磅，今設養川沙瀏河丹陽一帶已有成效之母牛百頭，公牛十頭，十七後卽繁殖至七百頭，以此類推，二十年後上海全市年値二千三百六十萬元之牛乳利權，卽可盡入國人之手，（二）畜中國種牛在三五千頭以上，照上海租界定章，每棚畜牛八十頭，以五千頭計，須六百二十五棚，何來如此廣大牧場，卽有，亦不勝負擔，應一部份在都市畜養，一部份在農村分養，倘在農村畜養，牛乳銷路較爲困難，因此要農村與都市聯絡合作，於中國農村大有裨益，（三）中國種牛，普通每頭價値六百元左右，較外國種牛爲廉，今以中國母牛一頭每日産乳八磅計，每磅以銀三角計，七個多月，即可償本，此外如産小牛，更爲額外利益，故由各個農家分養，或交牧場寄養，兩獲其利。</p>
<p>綜上所述，當知國人應畜中國種牛，但畜多數乳牛，資本必須充足，又須極好管理，因此牧場與銀行合作社技師獸醫五方面，應合作進行，庶可成爲大業。</p>
<p>（乙）牧場概况</p>
<p>上海新鮮牛乳，以工部局衛生處給予之Ａ字牌爲最優，中國牧場獲此執照者，目前祇有生生牧場自由農場畜植公司華德農場四家，每日每家産乳在二千磅左右，今生生牧場設　，有（一）器械消毒室，此室關於裝牛乳之物品，均先一律用科學方法消毒，（二）高壓蒸氣消毒室，以牛乳置一消毒鍋中，用高壓蒸氣通入，消除一切汚穢，（三）低壓消毒室，以牛乳置低氣壓中消毒，大致温度在一百四十五度，經三十五分鐘之時間，無須用高温度，就能消毒，故對於牛乳固有之成分，無甚變化，（四）牛奶棚，此係特製者，須經衛生處之檢定，（五）牧場一方，寛暢　宜，（六）冷氣間發動機一間，佈置周密，該場每日捋乳三次，捋乳者事前將手消毒，設在捋乳時，乳牛行將大小便時，另一工人卽爲注意，並卽掃除，總使牛乳絲毫不致汚穢，按之Ａ字牌牛乳，工部局衛生處定章，至多含細菌三萬，但經實際檢查，各該農場牛乳，所含細菌祇三四百，可使飲消毒牛乳者，按心服用</p>
<p>迫參觀畢，承沈君九成每人持贈鮮乳一瓶，當場試飲，極爲滿意，遂卽分别定飲·以質提倡，據沈君云，飲新鮮牛乳，不宜用金屬鍋子煮熟，最好用水鉢一只，内盛温水，將牛乳瓶放入，稍熱卽飲，最合衛生，不宜在金屬鍋中煮之太熱，致失滋養成分，家有身體虛弱者，務須常飲國貨消毒牛乳，一以營養個人身體，一以挽回國家利權，一舉兩得，樂爲之記。</p>

<p>— 治</p>
<p>招牌的作用，賽如商店的服裝，是有時代性的；在這時代大輪盤向前的時候，時裝是日新月異，却也有不少的招牌是没落了。</p>
<p>菜館裏的「滿漢全席」爲什麽要改成「大漢全席」？這不是辛亥革命成功後的事實表現。</p>
<p>海華大開以後，廣貨店轉變爲洋貨店，招牌是經售東西洋貨，自都市到鄉鎭，鞠躬盡瘁，曾主持了輪血工作若干年。可是，五四以還，在衆努難犯这下，大家得換招牌，閙成中西洋貨的笑話。</p>
<p>百貨商店總算是百無禁忌，「統辦寰球貨品」更是冠冕而堂皇，可是，在國貨年，這稷招牌必然要没落的，我敢担保。</p>
<p>現在，國貨公司已經替代了百貨公司，百貨公司也多添了國貨市或國貨商場，雖說用意所在，祗謀提倡，但是國貨并不怎麽人輕視，也足證明。</p>
<p>然而，這還没有完成國貨運動的使命呢！無論如何，我們得粉碎「統辦寰球貨品」這招牌，使這個社會上，祇有國貨商店，没有百貨商店！</p>

<p>▲可憐的布機</p>
<p>張老爹是村上數一數二的有錢人家，可憐他辛苦半身，只生有三個女兒，並無半個子息。口薄的人，常常當着他的吟着「尊室原來是瓦窰。」好在張老爹以爲男女平等，在民國法律上一様有繼承的權利，倒也不以爲意。</p>
<p>張老爹的妻子，也是一個有心計的人。眼見女兒大了，總要出嫁，便早晚軋軋的織着幾疋土布，好做嫁衣之用。大女兒嫁後，還預備織給第二和第三女兒咧。</p>
<p>秋凉天氣，燕爾良辰，張家的大女兒要出嫁了。大小姐却對伊媽說道：土織的布，又粗又難看，穿了怎様走向人前？我要剪些洋布，免得給人笑我土氣。</p>
<p>他媽聽了這話，也着實贊成，便說：洋布便宜，顔色花紋又好看，以後不用自己織吧！便呌長工把布機砍掉，當做硬柴燒。</p>
<p>布機砍的當兒，似在嗚嗚的哭泣。庆時張老爹剛從茶館中回來，見了這種景狀，不覺又悲又怒，因向妻子叱道：我姓張的有今日地步，全靠一張布機，一把鋤頭，吃的穿的，都不用化錢去買。現把布機砍掉，一半的家業，已給你們化掉去也！說罷，撫着布機，痛哭不止。</p>
<p>這時大小姐和他的媽媽，也燠悔不迭，跟着一齊哭起來了。正是滿室喜氣，化作一天烏雲，誰敎你們給洋布魅惑，砍掉這忠僕般的布機呢！</p>

<p>她好似要誇耀自己的美麗，期待着别人的讚賞，情不自禁地像踏着却而司登舞式的由臥室跳躍到外面，嘴邊還嘘嘘地吹看催眠曲，當她走到客堂裏的時候，一眼瞥見了她的表兄明正在和她母親攀談着，這一下她更其是興奮了，因爲她可以　現她新裝的美麗。</p>
<p>「唔，明哥，什麽時候來的？」她見了他就這様的發問，同時留意他見了自己底新裝要不知怎様地　　。</p>
<p>「呀，瑛妹，來不多………」他回過頭來目光接觸在瑛的簇新的旗袍上，言語突然地中止了。</p>
<p>這是出於她意料之外的失望，他非但不讚美自己，在他面部的表演上顯然有點怒意，這時她把滿心底希望都消失了，她覺得他的變態的奇突，末來由地受他的輕視，奚落，她好似受了重大羞辱，萬般地高興化成了一肚皮的闷氣，掉轉身來就一口氣地奔回她的臥室，懊　，憤恨，刺進了她底脆弱的心房。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ　　ＸＸＸ　　ＸＸＸ　ＸＸＸ　ＸＸＸ　ＸＸＸ</p>
<p>瑛現在才明白了自己底過失，她醒悟了，她悔恨着自己底魯莽，經騐告訴她在買衣料的時候必須細考她的來源，現在是知道她受了奸商的欺騙，做了人們所獻惡的冷血動物，她現在不但不恨他而感激他了，因爲他指示了她的訛誤，她鄭重地把他的來信詳細地捧讚着，重復地讀着，尤其是在他的信裏面這様地一段；</p>
<p>………縱使你十分地恨我，我是要盡力地來忠告你的，這是良心所鞭策我要這様的做呀！</p>
<p>想不到你變了這様的麻木，消沉，走向那没落地深陷，違背了自己底良心爲敵作仗，身穿敵貨而不知羞慚！　道你忘了過去的遭受了嗎？</p>
<p>在淞滬血戰的那時，你狼狽地由破碎的家裏避難來滬，那時間你怎様的愾憤敵人的兇横，搥胸蹬足地痛駡敵人的殘酷，　拳擦掌地　　永遠與敵絶交，永遠不用敵貨，這些，這些你委實忘　了嗎？</p>
<p>雖然在是停戰了，但是敵人的野心依舊高張着，這是你該知道的吧，</p>
<p>在這提倡國貨的聲浪高人雲霄的時期，我們還能不儘量的服用國貨嗎？……………………</p>

<p>— 仲方</p>
<p>讀了唐弢先生的「青年的需要」，頗多感觸，也想來說幾句了。</p>
<p>從前「五四」時代，「非難」青年們需要「多的和新的花様，强大的刺激」的，似乎還只有老年人，然而當時舊派的老年人却還没說青年人「需要說誑」：而今是青年康嗣華先生也「非難」青年們了。而且還進一步，以爲青年需要「說誑」。從青年人自己羣中喊出這句話，自然更加有「力」！而且抱着這様見解的，一定還不止一個青年康先生。</p>
<p>這就是「現在」不同於「五四」的一點。在「五四」那時，「父與子的衝突」這句話還夠用，在「現在」。衝突的所以然不能夠死版版地從年齡上去找求了。現在不是有些青年「老成持重」之態可掬，而也有些過了青年的人到是火性很旺麽？</p>
<p>問題就在於康先生所謂「需要說誑」。</p>
<p>康先生似乎自以爲不需要說誑，也不需要多的新的花様。可是我們張開眼睛看看，多的新的花様不是層出不窮麽？而且說誑的法門不是一天一天巧妙了麽？在這空氣裏，難道反是付之不聞不見，像康先生那様的，纔稱是不需要說誑麽？自然，康先生所非難的，不是我這裏所說的「多的新的花様」，可是正因爲他是這様，他就成爲了眞正需要說誑。而康先生所非難的「多的新的花様」也就是他　非難的「說誑」。</p>
<p>在「現在」，不需要說誑的人，就不免有點「火性」，即使並未「非　」過「沈靜其實淵博的言論和態度」，不大愛讀，倒也是實情，這其實不關年齡的「青」或「老」，請看青年康先生就已經「現身說法」了！</p>
<h3 id="c262">蒲諾阿與諾貝爾奬金 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>前天聽說這一次諾貝爾奬金給與了「從舊金山來的紳士」的作者蒲寗。昨天看了根據法國翰林院大學士蒲諾阿（Pierre　Benoit）的小說而作的影片「伏虎美人」（Atlantide）。這兩事無形中在我的腦中起了連繫。</p>
<p>「伏虎美人」這一篇小說，我作學生的時代，就想讀，可老没有讀成，大學士蒲諾阿先生，到東洋旅行過，好像還在報知新聞社的大講堂講演過。可是，我没有瞻仰過他的大學士老爺的丰彩。敎師恩貝爾可洛得是一位法國天主敎的和尙，他是非常地稱讚這位大學士老爺的。說他是現代的大仲馬。大仲馬我是不歡喜的，並不是因爲他是法國人和黑人女子所生的雜種。他那些武俠小說，我眞不十分高興看。就是因爲他不藝術，現在回想起來，怕是因爲他太没有進步性的原故罷。因爲不喜歡大仲馬的原故，所以也殃及了大學士蒲諾阿了。雖然如此，但是，還是時時地想瞧上他一眼</p>
<p>此次蒲諾阿的大作「伏虎美人」居然上了銀幕。而次殖民地的民衆也得到了瞻仰牠的眼福。况且，作者蒲諾阿在三年之前也被選爲法國翰林院的大學士。人貴了，文章總是値銀子罷。於是，我只得高看他一眼。而且最近有人介紹過說：「伏虎美人」裏，充滿着「詩意」。「百聞不如一見。」於是，昨天，我就跑去看了一下子。</p>
<p>沙漠的風景，底確令人心醉。美則美矣。但是在那種美的後邊，像是藏着利刃在刺我的心。現在的這位「大仲馬」，在「伏虎美人」裏，清清楚楚地表現出他是帝國主義者的爪牙了。他是同普西卡里（Psihari）和路易，貝特蘭（L,Bertrand）同様的。在他的小說「伏虎美人」中，蒲諾阿不是高聲地謳歌着法國對於菲洲殖民地的侵略麽？這許是他被選爲翰林院大學士的主要的原因罷。他的空想，想出來那篇「伏虎美人」，可是，他終露出他的狐狸尾巴了。他令我們感到的，只是些尖銳的利刃。</p>
<p>據說，法國翰林院中，只有法朗士老人（Anatole　France）是一個人。要用我們「貴國」的「土包子」的話來說，是只有他「夠得上兩撇」。這是好久好久以前的話，據說，法朗士除了在就職當時，到過一次翰林院外，以後，則並未豋過那塵「大雅之堂。」法朗士老人死後，法國翰林院，自然是是清一色了。像蒲諾阿一流的人，得被選爲大學士，是必然的道理罷。</p>
<p>然而，無論怎様說，蒲諾阿是「保有着舊有的作風。」他是現在的亞力山大仲馬。</p>
<p>今天（十三日，禮拜一，）在自由談上，致立先生寫了如下的一段：</p>
<p>「今年的諾貝爾賞金，據說是到在俄國作家蒲寗手裏了。而且據說：「其人生於一八七零年爲俄國輓近小說家，善短篇小說。渠不採用俄國文學的新趨勢能保持舊有作風。」</p>
<p>根據以上的這段話推論下去，明年的諾貝爾奬金，是應當頒給「伏虎美人」的作者了。因爲蒲諾阿是保持大仲馬的作風的。</p>
<p>我在此作的，是一個「預言。」同時是用「預言家」的資格向諾貝爾奬金管理人員提議。可是，次殖民地的人說的話。能不能算數呢？大概，次殖民地的人。是旣没有提議，也没有得奬的資格。我們不是也有「火燒紅蓮寺」麽？</p>
<h3 id="c263">大雜院風景 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 青農</p>
<p>寓所的窗前，望下去是一個大雜院。西南兩面是别個弄堂的後壁，東邊就是我的寓所的窗下，坐北朝南一排平房，面前空地的面積只不過兩三丈四方，在中央還蓋着一間没樓的矮房，丨這就是大雜院的區域。那一排一樓的底的平房分三間屋子，一間屋子住了起碼六家人家。那在中央的一間矮房，也起碼住了四家人家。屋那麽的少，人那麽的多，眞是虧他們住得下去。</p>
<p>天一亮，大雜院的爵士音樂，就開始高亢急　地合奏起來，丨那是在洗馬桶。一二十個馬桶在洗滌，裏頭還放下蚶壳，你想那一種聲音呌我怎麽不「黎明卽起」呢？</p>
<p>「爵士音樂」停奏以後，女子駡丈夫，媽媽打兒子，小朋友吵架，…有聲電影又開演了。你想，我還能夠靜心的寫文章嗎？</p>
<p>我每天受擾不過便索性站在窗前鑑賞着這一幅美麗的風景。</p>
<p>在矮房的面前用大竹竿搭一個架，從中間的平房的樓上走廊的欄干將小竹竿掛上架子在晒衣服，那是什麽大娘自己的衣服吧，絞得不乾，水在滴着，下面的什麽大嫂開口駡啦。於是乎兩人不顧什麽羞恥地，臭駡起起。</p>
<p>第一間平房的門前有一口井，一二十家人家吃飯洗菜洗衣服都靠這一口井，什麽姑娘　頭垂兩條辮子，身穿格布旗袍的那一個丨正在打水，旁邊站着什麽嬸娘駡她那様遲緩，等得人腿酸，姑娘不讓，兩人也開口對駡啦。</p>
<p>天上嗡嗡嗡，飛機，飛機，大家閉了嘴，停了工作，伸長着脖子望着天空。八九歳的小妹妹抱着隔壁嬸娘的寳寳在望飛機，不提妨脚下一塊石頭，小妹妹連同寳寳倒在地主，寳寳哇的一聲大哭，小妹妹嚇得臉臉孔有如一張白紙，隔壁的嬸良搶　幾步將寳寳抱起，連呌乖乖不要怕，寳寳的哭聲停止，小妹妹的受嚇這時才哭出聲來。</p>
<p>大妹的媽，蓬鬆着頭髮在門口等人，一個穿破舊嗶嘰旗袍的女人從外面進了這大雜院，不時回頭看後面，身上藏有軍火似地走着，驚惶的神情在瘦削的臉孔上表現出來，奇怪，只看她走近大妹的媽從腿上的長統襪子裏頭拿出一張小紙頭，連手上的銅板一起塞在大妹的媽的手裏，不出聲地彼此點頭地分開。大妹丨那大眼睛的姑娘丨站在進口那裡把風。她們在幹賭花會的秘密工作啦。接着，男男女女有好幾個都一様的鬼鬼崇崇地和大妹的媽接頭。有一個姑娘的小紙頭上寫明所賭的花會名字的丨是從她的燙過的大頭髮裡頭拿出來的，秘密工作做得顚是神妙。</p>
<p>對駡的聲音，大呌的聲音，吵架的聲音，小孩子哭的聲音，没有一秒鐘停止播送。</p>
<p>矮房前面，老太婆和白頭髮老伯伯放下兩架紡紗機開始嗡嗡嗡地紡紗起來了。丨這是絃索的梵啞雙奏，比較早晨的銅樂的「爵士音樂」，來得清靜悠揚。</p>
<p>可是，「爵士音樂」是我的「黎明卽起」的前奏曲，這梵啞琳雙奏却成了我整日的寫作時間的催眠調。</p>
<p>不過，在星期日，大雜院的「野薔薇」回來，在「梵啞琳雙奏」裡頭，可以聽到她的清麗的歌聲，大雜院美化了啦。</p>
<p>這「野薔薇」是住在中間房子裏頭一家人家的女兒，年紀約莫十六七歳，苗條的身材，俏麗的龐兒，喜歡穿着大藍布隂丹士林的旗袍，燙着頭髮，穿着球鞋，是在什麽女學校諗着的一個女學生，她每逢星期六下午就回家，星期日時常放喉高唱，有時唱的是時行的小調，有時却唱的是學校裏頭敎的什麽歌。歌喉清脆圓潤，怕是一個學校裡頭的歌舞明星吧？她唱歌的地方，有的時候在樓上屋子裡，有的時候却跑到井邊跳着唱的啦。</p>
<p>「野薔薇」，或許就呌「野貓」吧，她也時常和鄰家的姑娘們鬥嘴，一鬥嘴多麽厲害，你看她的眼睛兒竪着，她的嘴唇兒動着不停。可是，她一不知人家門嘴，她就唱歌，多麽動人的歌聲。</p>
<p>「野薔薇」的哥哥在捕房當包打聽，他每天早晨在奏着「爵士音樂」的時候出門，大塊頭，銅盆帽，黑布大袴，時常令我聯想到我以前所碰見的包打聽，而引起過去的迴憶。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>好久以來他便歎息着他的身體不好，覺得笨重，常有一些莫名其妙的不適。醫生再說道：</p>
<p>「因爲手槍的彈子可以從你的身邊經過，而酒則一定吞入你的肚裏。」</p>
<p>「吞入肚裏便怎様呢？」</p>
<p>「便燃燒着你的胃，擾亂你的神經系統，使得血液停滯，容易中風，像你這様體質的人是都有着中風的危險的。」</p>
<p>退隱的手飾商那種逐漸增大的醉意像一縷烟被風吹散了一様：他以一種不安與凝滯的眼光瞧着他的兒子，想要知道他究竟是不是在說笑話。</p>
<p>但　寳汝呌說道：</p>
<p>「啊！這班醫生，他們總是一様的：呌你不要貪吃，不要喝酒，不要頑女人，不要跳輪舞。這一切都是對於身體有害的。好啦！我却様様都來，在世界各地，到處盡量地頑着，而我的身體也並不怎様　　」</p>
<p>筆爾嚴厲地回答道：</p>
<p>「第一，你比我父親强壯；並且一切愛頑的人都和你一様說直到有天……而第二天他們却不會回來對那謹愼的醫生說：「醫生，你從前說的話不錯。」當我看見我的父親幹着對他最壞且最危險的勾當，我給他豫告一下，那是狠自然的事。不然，我便是一個不好的兒子了。」</p>
<p>感着没趣的羅蘭媽媽出來干涉道：</p>
<p>「算了罷，筆爾，你怎麽的？單單一次，這不會對他有什麽害處的。你想想看，今天他是怎様的快樂，我們是怎様的快樂。你這様會使他完全掃興並使我鉼居家難過的。你這行爲太不行！」</p>
<p>他聳聳肩喃喃地說道：</p>
<p>「他要怎様便怎様好了。我已經給他預告了。」</p>
<p>可是羅蘭老爹不再喝了。他看着他的杯子，那盛滿着内光透亮的酒的杯子，許多小汽泡從杯底急促而又迅速地浮上來消失在杯面就像是這忽且醉人的酒的靈魂飛逝了一様；他像一隻狐狸發現一隻死雞，嗅着一個陷穽似的，抱着滿懷疑慮，瞧着他的酒杯。</p>
<p>他的猶疑地問道：</p>
<p>「你以爲這事對於我非常有害嗎？」</p>
<p>筆爾有了一種懊悔，覺得不該爲着自己的心境不佳而使别人跟着苦惱。</p>
<p>「不要緊，偶一爲之，没有什麽，你可以喝，可是不要喝得太多，並且不要養成習慣。」</p>
<p>於是羅蘭老爹端起酒杯，但還没有决定把它靠近嘴巴去。他狠痛苦地凝視着它，又想喝，又害怕；隨後他嗅着，嘗着，小口地喝着，細細吟味着，同時心裏充滿了苦懊，懦弱和貪饞，當他把最後一滴喝下了時，又充滿了悔恨。</p>
<p>筆爾突然遇着了陸太太的眼光；那澄清的眼光停在他身上，現得明識而且嚴勵。筆爾感覺到，領會到，猜想到這眼光裏所含的思想，這頭腦而簡單且正直是小女人的憤慨的思想，因爲這眼光無異生說：「你嫉妬，你。這是可羞啊。」</p>

<p>— 邨人</p>
<p>從前在學生時代心直口快，動輒得罪他人，有一位先生敎訓之曰：如此情格將來到社會服務，一定到處碰壁，危險萬分。對人態度要和平，莫說已長，妄談彼短。</p>
<p>丨先生，我並没說人家的壞話。</p>
<p>丨說話不顧對方的利害，爭論不留對方的餘地，這就是等於談他的壞話様，甚至於比說他的壞話還要令他不能下台。說話令人不能下台，這種態度就不好。</p>
<p>可是雖受訓誨，到底性格生成，山可移性格改不了，還是時常對人說話態度不好。先生喟然而嘆曰：孺子不可敎也！</p>
<p>離開學校，到了社會，先生的預言應騐，到處碰壁。碰壁的原因，就是心直口快，甚至於連好朋友却得罪。</p>
<p>碰壁之交，曾請敎於世故老人，丨一位同鄉丨老人曰：頭角崢嶸，入世未深，血氣方剛，涵養不足，再碰幾次壁，然後自然悟道於微。</p>
<p>又過幾年，白髮已生，鬍子已長，碰壁之次數雖然多，對人談話的態度仍然不好，再請敎於世故老人。老人曰：你碰了幾次壁，還不悟道嗎？</p>
<p>丨懂了一點，起初還能夠裝腔作勢，談話的時間一長久，到後來還是態度不好。</p>
<p>丨能夠裝腔作勢地和人談話，孺子已經可敎了。你不能夠一直維持着裝腔作勢的態度嗎？只要小心翼翼，切莫大言炎炎，思過半矣。</p>
<p>丨然而，願聞敎言。</p>
<p>丨比方與人寒喧，應該不要立刻將寒熱的天氣破口而出，只說道：「今天的天氣哈哈哈…」如果那人說「今天的天氣眞冷，」你才說，「是的，眞冷。」那就不會得罪於人。維持這種打哈哈主義，說話自然是八面玲瓏，任你和他說話的時間怎麽長久，决不會還是態度不好了。</p>
<p>然而這打哈哈主義與我無緣，根本上就不會哈哈地假笑，仍然到處對人說話的態度不好，而且碰壁。</p>
<p>嗚呼，難矣哉，打哈哈主義。此生已矣，但願來世爲人兒子的時候，就會打哈哈。</p>

<p>— 炳</p>
<p>是兩年前的事了。</p>
<p>在學校裏，我是那麽一個傻人，不喜交際，甚至連話都有些不大高興合人家說。却很寃枉的常被學生會一類的團體拉去做配脚，在這種情形之下，通常的同學是最忘形的了，大可假名借義，跑到西宫東宫去獻情賣俏，至少可充一位那兒的走廊裏的遊客，有事無事去兜幾個圈兒。如果引起吊膀子的流言，也儘有分說餘地，丨丨不是去收繳學生會會費，便可說是爲籌備遊藝會去敦促××校花上台，或者還可說是爲「抗日」「振災一去募捐。如是，流言儘管流，你的「嚓嚓嚓」的紋皮鞋聲（漆皮鞋也許還要時髦）也儘管在油頭挺胸的整容下進展你的使命。</p>
<p>我眞是太傻了丨彷彿中了「女人是禍水」的毒似的，雖然有時候也　奇想，但一見了女同學總有些瞧不上眼。這也許爲的是本身的缺陷太多丨丨年頭到尾是那麽一套破長衫，面孔又黃中顯黑　自己常常覺得，這様的人，是必然要受她們的嘲弄的，事實彷彿如此。一碰着她們，就　　　　着得出她們　　　笑我。</p>
<p>可以說是敎務課的辦事員有意的捉弄我，這一學期把我和一個姓×的女同學偏在一桌，起初我有些氣憤，但這又只能私地咽吞下去，也就平平穩穩的與伊同桌坐下了。</p>
<p>伊雖不是校花宫主，却有着同等的名氣，一對犀利的眸子，一張懸河似的櫻嘴，一幅隨遇大方的態度，是伊的一些根本美點，也就是伊迷蕩了若干同學的醇醪。</p>
<p>自我們同桌以後，我爲避免牽搭，從此總要遲五分鐘才偷偷的避着敎員的跟綫閃進課堂裏去，下課了，我的脚便在打鈴的應聲裏趕先跨出了課堂。</p>
<p>這様，我們相安無事，同學們也找不着給我散布流言的嫌隙，倒反而加我以傻王的訕笑，因爲正有不少的同學苦着没有機會同伊接近。</p>
<p>不久以後，我發現下伊一種秘密，就是我每課上堂去，總見伊撕着伊自己的拍紙簿給我上抺試橙上的灰塵，我驚奇着想：「呵，女人，這也許就是女人的一個特徵！」</p>
<p>接着去來　　，種　　　就是每　的帶了回去，而且還要四不相的贊美幾聲。明知道伊是不會看這些撈什子的眞。糟，拿去了就不退轉來，問伊要，伊總說是下一課帶來。我不能再等了的時候，只得說出十三分穩靠的句子：「蜜司×，下一課無論如何請你帶來」！下一課又没有帶來，我再討，伊說：「等一會請你跟我去取麽！」於是乎我踱進了伊們的香巢，伊是那麽客氣的拖出許多的糖菓來，在那様的情况下，我彷彿覺得屋子在旋迴，眼前只是花圈的晃漾。</p>
<p>期考快臨了，伊吞吞吐吐的只說没有把握，意思就是說要我給伊鬆鬆肩。期考臨了，我恰害着咳嗽的重傷風，伊知道了，馬上給我買來了一瓶醫治的「杏仁露」，同時在伊的「嫣然一笑」之下把伊的一些論文題目及卷子塞下了我的枕頭。（完）</p>

<p>生了三天病，被鄉間的一封快信免强從床上催起身來。對鏡梳洗時，眞不信僅僅生了三天病，像害了三個月一様，下頦像等邊的在一角，顯然兩頰上的肉被病魔侵消了，一雙近視眼，更顯得沉陷在眼眶裏，面色天然青菜様的慘白；然同鄉間的一件事等候着我在兩天之前要去完成的。</p>
<p>天氣雖在秋冬之間，今天似乎特别奥暖，蔚穿了一襲夾旗袍，因爲多跑了幾次樓梯，已換上了單衫，我知道鄉間的氣候較上海寒冷，而且我說不定要有一三天的勾留，生了三不病已起了重大的變化，爲了保重賤軀起見，不怕蔚笑我，披起了厚厚的駱駝絨長袍，同時還帶了大衣，自己對鏡子照照，太像個抽大烟的癆病鬼。</p>
<p>黃包車拉近火車站時候，我瞧見鐘樓上離開車時間尙餘五分鐘了。怱怱付了車錢，頭埋緊在大衣領内加緊脚步跳上石級，没有留意被一個大漢攔住了去路　　　便未　稽察員，自然背後站着腰間懸念十砲的，士。我隨即站住了脚，伸平了兩手，由他上下左右撫摸一番</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>。然而是否我多穿了一點衣服，諸如一些細小的物件他的手指上的觸覺没有這様的靈敏而没有破獲他的目的物，或者還有什麽他們職業上的緣故命我解開大衣？這當然是他職務上的權利，如其你想踏上車站去乘火車是不能反抗的，而且在上海，即使你安安穩穩的坐在家中，有時也會飛將軍從天而降遇到這類的把戲。然而我能自己知道是那様的坦白，火車是在五分鐘後要開出車站了；下一次的客車要在下午，這多少對於我鄉間的要事發生關係，我不由得由憤怒而假裝痴呆的問：「查什麽？」</p>
<p>「違警品！」如其我下一個不甚適當的比喻來形容這一聲回答，像在滬戰時一個槍子從窗外打來一様的怕人。</p>
<p>恕我没有知道在一個如艷陽天氣的秋天穿一襲駱駝絨袍子是否違警？由他從每個口袋裏找遍了，一個皮夾，一個紙包，他都像查軍用地圖似的那様鄭重其事，最後我的襪管和寛緊帶的内層，盡在衆目照彰之下（這我不能怪四周圍聚攏來的觀衆，因爲這似乎是一件很可値得一看的把戲）顯露出來，幸得今天從病床上爬起來，一雙千孔百穿的舊襪已交給娘姨了。這様鄭重其事的稽查，火車上的司機者却没有知道在車站外面發生了這様一件事，車子已蠕蠕地跑了。</p>
<p>總計，他没有查到我褲子的内層，及我背上的一顆大紅痣丨這我斷定他没有瞧見，不然他一定要大聲怪呌的，因爲我的老祖母說你背上的紅痣，生下來的時候穩婆也嚇了一跳，可見這紅痣的驚人了。他雖有稽查的本領，然而對於紅痣之類的認識一定没有穩婆的經騐充足，我没有聽見他呌，也没有瞧見他跳，足見他没有發現我的紅痣。</p>
<p>火車是開出了。我穿好了衣服祗能喊黃包車回來，他似乎還没有滿意似的想起了我的帽子，不料在邊緣内發見了一張我從前辦事處的名刺，他瞧了我一眼，用了比槍子聲音温和一千萬倍的低度說：「對不起！」</p>
<p>不要說瞧把戲的朋友呆了，連我這自己做戲的人也有些口目皆呆，一張這末小小機關的名刺，有這末驚人的效力？</p>
<p>「早知道，那盒名刺裝了錦盒每天藏在身邊了。」在黃包車夫上想着這時不由笑了起了。</p>
<p>回家來告訴蔚被稽查的經過，我問她我倒底在什麽地方有名顯的違警品的綫索？</p>
<p>「或才是你生了三天的病吧？」我的妻子幽默的說。</p>
<p>我笑着對鏡子望望像害了三個月病似的人影。</p>

<p>菊花本來以「晚節抓芳」爲人所稱道，自從陶淵明先生因「不合時宜」而歸隱林下，執菊自娱，以菊花比君子，這様的竭力「捧塲」以後，菊花的身價格外高了起來。於是無分雅俗，一到秋天，總要找幾盆菊花玩玩。</p>
<p>一直遞壇到現在，藝菊的方法日有增進，就是說一天改善一天，從前的人夢想不到的，譬如一株菊花上面可以開兩種或者數種顔色形狀的花，以及一盆菊花裏面的花朶可以開得一般大小高矮等等，現在都可以利用科學方法，人工培植，一點也不希奇的了。</p>
<p>就菊花的形狀而品名，例如：鵝黃，蟹爪………等等，到現在亦已顯得不高明之至。秘須要題以很風雅的名兒，方纔顯得不同凡嚮，超越萬卉，例如：紅白相間的謂之「平分秋色」，衆小一大的謂之「衆星捧日」，等等。</p>
<p>此次我所看見的菊花的確並不壞，而尤其是曁南大學及小觀園的出品來得特别漂亮，本來，這一個「菊展」是彙集了許多人的心血的結晶，當然不是容易的事。不過，我於讀賞歎觀之餘，我却覺得人工的雕硺氣太厲害了，完全失却了渾樸天眞的氣慨，祗是妖豔淫美。假使以女人來比喻的話，那末，這些都是將要失去青春的少婦，都是飽經風霜的豔姬；美固然是美極了，但是已經失去了她的天眞，失去了她的純潔。</p>
<p>或者我的道一個見解未免過於偏激了一點，然而我還有另一個觀念：</p>
<p>小觀園的幾盆「娟影」「金貌」………</p>
<p>不是以高脚的紅木架子架起在那兒麽，祗要是去看過一看的大概印象很深罷，樹幹矮矮的，可是從上面垂下來，一　垂到花架之半，滿綴着小小的花朶，黃的如金星高點，白的如銀光　照，　在菊花陣中，宛如　　之鶴，大有睥睨其他之勢。可是，在鄉下，竹籬邊，河岸旁，同様的在土内長着，可是她没有精緻的花盆，没有美觀的紅木的花架，更没有甚麽人去注意她：祗是讓汚泥去染上她的面頰，任牛羊去踐踏她的身體，即使有人賞光，也不過是村莊間的小女孩把她採擷了來，簪在髮邊，但是不須一天，早就棄在路旁了。在如此情形之下，僥倖的固然是僥倖了，可以跳上紅木架子，傲睨儕輩：可是終身埋没於草澤之間的，眞不知幾許呢！</p>
<p>「菊展」是在大陸商場的三樓，而「菊花市塲」就在四樓，「菊花市場」是已經開了幕好多天了，許多的菊花當然是没有許多心血結晶的「菊展」裏的出品好，尤其是把這許多美人似的花卉，擺在枯燥的立體建築物之下，格外顯得傖俗不堪了。就是「菊展」也還未能免除這個「毛病」，雖然是壁上還懸掛了名家的書畫丨丨大　家視爲風雅之尤的書畫。</p>
<p>本來，「牡丹雖好，全仗綠葉扶持」，一粒夜明珠丢在牛屎堆上也會减色的，世間的事何獨不然，記得去年此時在南京玄武湖看的菊花展覽會，湖光水色之中，還有紅的花白的花倍襯着，大部分的菊花是栽在土内的，天然的氣息，欣欣向榮着，比較有意思得多了。</p>
<h3 id="c270">操場上 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>丨自家人不要搶呀！丨</p>
<p>籃球架壞了，不能玩，於是臨時改變方針，大家來玩「大將球」（Captain　Ball）。所謂大將球是這様的：把全隊人分甲乙二組，在塲地的中點，劃一條中線，中線兩旁各劃三個等大的圓圈，圓圈内外，各立一人，則共需十二人，在塲地中可以自由奔跑擲球的，Ｃenter甲乙組各二人，共四人，所以玩這種球，共需十六人，我被推爲公證人；在未玩以前，我就這様的對衆動員說：「雖然在操塲上，仍舊什麽事情都要紀奸化；這有　　不　　　　筋　或　當知　　是友誼比賽呀丨更要牢記的就是自家人得自家人不搶。</p>
<p>於是就很輕快地掀起鬥爭的波浪；接着，兩方面就劇烈地賽着。這時，操塲上除了擊球聲外，所聽見的就是一片的「自家人不要搶呀！」「自家人不要搶呀！」啊丨我聽見這聲浪，我心裏就翻騰着極大的感觸！這「自家人不要搶呀」的微弱的聲浪，可惜祗能在操塲上聽得見，要是能夠廣播結那專會實行「搶自家」的混蛋們聽聽，眞要愧死那班東西呀！………</p>

<p>— 列火</p>
<p>九月裏底太陽，還是熱得可怕，晒久了，皮膚上有些發癢，好似有毛虫或蚊子一類的東西在咬着一様，好在樹葉還未全落掉，遮去了不少的陽光，加之習習的秋風帶有寒意地送着它底調劑的調子，所以我倆也便不覺得如何的熱了，只是渾身温暖，怪寫意的。</p>
<p>「五姊，爲什麽女人定要合男人睡了以後，才有孩子生？我還不全明白，你再講一遍！」我重覆把我倆底中心問題話了出來。</p>
<p>「你不要有意裝傻，你還不明白麽，我不相信！」餘下的是嬌嗔一笑。</p>
<p>「眞的囉，不然我還問你幹麽！」自己說了，自己全不相信這話裏有一様的眞實性，所以臉頰立地紅了。</p>
<p>五姊用她底姆指頭在我底臉頰上掃了一下，說了一聲「怪害羞的」！我更感到不安；然而我又暗自興奮，那是當然的生理現象，這様五姊竟把我樓在她底懷裏了，於是我倆便面面相偎着，身子也凑合得很緊貼，我如酣醉了似的，感到從未有過的飄飄然。</p>
<p>忽然天色暗淡起來，秋雷響得像敲打牛皮鼓似的不景氣，大楓樹底後面的芳叢撲通通地作響，我倆嚇了一跳，連忙走回家。媽媽看了簍子是空空的。已經是夠納罕的了；加又瞧見我底兩扇嘴唇已變成了青色，臉頰也顯然有些異様，渾身顫抖抖的，知道我是受了驚嚇，連忙在我底額上膜上三手陽火，一壁盤問：「什麽事？嚇成這様子，松毛没簏到是莫關係的，你快說」！我没有回答，只是用勁地向媽媽底懷裏鑽，腦袋裏湧出了如此一道疑問：「嗎嗎說過，做了不可告人的壞事，電公是要打他的，不知是不是眞的？」可是我不敢向媽媽提問。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>那是因爲杜先生素來巴結的手叚高明，新到的縣長，竟是杜先生底故舊，所以杜先生在放割稻學的六月裏，便抽了閒兼程跑進縣城裏去了，聽說他在啓程之前，爲了要置些比較入時的衣服，苦無銅錢，便舍命的出賣了十三名谷的青苗結李太爺，換得二十個袁頭，於是他便拿着做了十二元的衣服，兩套頂時髦的白竹布汗衣褲，一件土貨夏布長衫，那自然不是有名的瀏陽夏布，虧了杜師母漂了多少時候，才比較白凈些；可是依舊脫不了土氣習，泥滋味。</p>
<p>杜師母對杜先生這様的盛舉，却有些不滿意：「賣了青苗去找事，找到了不話；若不成，那下半年是要挨餓的了，一害的」丨這可算是冒天下之大險矣！」杜師母到底是杜師母，受了杜老師底薰陶，說起話來比普通的村婦是要高明幾分，很簡潔：且自然的有些合乎近代的邏輯學。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Situation in Fujian Gradually Becomes Tense: Dai Ji Arrives in the Province to Meet Key Figures; Chen Mingshu's Telegram Has Not Yet Been Sent; Li Jishen Is at the Center of the Current Situation; Summer Reports Publish Shanghai Telegrams Being Confiscated; The Central Government Hopes Hu Hanmin Will Come to Beijing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Dai Ji took a plane dispatched by the headquarters on the 15th from Xiamen to Fuzhou. Although the situation in Fujian is tense, it is still brewing and has not reached the point of being revealed. It is rumored in Shanghai that Chen Mingshu has already sent a telegram, but in reality, it has not been sent. Li Jishen is coming to Fujian from Hong Kong by Dutch ship and is expected to pass Xiamen on the 17th. How the situation in Fujian will change will be determined after Li arrives in Fuzhou. It is unclear whether Hu Hanmin will come, but the changes in the Fujian situation depend on whether Li comes and the results of the consultations after he arrives. Therefore, Li is currently the most noteworthy figure in the Fujian situation, because matters must be decided by Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen. The Xiamen newspaper on the 15th reported that the Shanghai telegrams stated the situation in Fujian was about to change. After it was issued, the Public Security Bureau dismissed the inspectors and confiscated newspapers from other regions. For those already delivered locally, the police were ordered to go to the shops and cut out the telegrams. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Dai Ji arrived in the province on the 15th. In the evening, key figures met Dai at the Sanqiao Club. Li Jishen came to Fujian for sightseeing on the 14th. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Reports say that Central Committee members in Shanghai, as well as Wang and Jiang, have sent representatives to welcome Hu to Beijing to take office. Someone met Wang and asked if this was true. Wang replied that since the outbreak of the national crisis, the central government has had the aspiration of sincere unity to jointly face the national crisis. Therefore, it is necessary to unite all important figures in the opposition. The central government is eager for Mr. Hu to come to Beijing to jointly manage national affairs. However, it is difficult to predict whether Hu will come to Beijing willingly. In short, China cannot be a divided mess. All Chinese people must unite and share the responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. Another important person said that if Mr. Hu has left Hong Kong, please come directly north and do not stay in Xiamen. The central government will treat him with sincerity. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Dai Ji is still in Xiamen and has postponed his trip to the province. Dai will talk in Xiamen for two or three days before going to the province. It is undecided whether he will take the new position as Director of Civil Affairs. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The troops stationed in Pucheng and Jian'ou are assisting in suppressing the remaining bandits in Chong'an. Liu Heding is actively reorganizing his troops. On the 14th, he sent his adjutant, Song Yuting, by plane to the province to meet Jiang and Cai to report. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian are meeting with various princes in Bailing Temple. According to Chu Minyi, Huang and others have sent telegrams to Beijing from Mongolia. However, before concrete measures are determined, they cannot be announced to the public. It is also heard that after Huang and others return to Suiyuan, they will conduct in-depth research on the entire policy of governing Mongolia with the authorities of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi provinces and report it to the central government. There should be no unexpected obstacles. They will stay for about another week and then set off to return to Beijing. As for the limits shown by the government, such as not infringing on the administrative organization of Suiyuan and Chahar and granting Mongolians the establishment of an autonomous committee of leagues and banners, it is hoped that the princes will agree. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Qingzong, a counselor of the Mongolian Committee, took the opportunity to inspect Inner Mongolia with Huang and Zhao to investigate the economic and security situation in Mongolia, so that he could report to the central government upon his return to Beijing for reference in research and handling.

<p>(Nanjing) News from the National Government: a telegram from Chairman Lin stated that he would pass Wusongkou at 3:30 PM on the 15th, without stopping in Shanghai, and would arrive at Xiaguan at around 7:00 AM on the 16th. Officials at all levels of the National Government are ready to welcome him at the riverbank at that time. Furthermore, according to a wireless report from the Yingrui warship receiving the call, it had already passed Wusongkou at 3:00 PM and was heading straight back to Beijing. (15th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) At 1:00 PM on the 12th, a Russian plane flew in from the north over Gubeikou. It was gray-white and flew very high, conducting reconnaissance for about 20 minutes before flying back north. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e7">No Date Set for the Return of the Great Wall Passes; The Japanese Side Claims It Must Wait for the Construction of Barracks Outside the Pass; The Establishment of Customs Is Under Investigation; Negotiations on Postal Services Are Abandoned <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Although the Japanese side has agreed in writing to return the Great Wall passes, due to the presence of Japanese troops in places such as Gubeikou and Cheheqiao, they must wait for the construction of barracks outside the pass before they can withdraw, and the handover to our side must be delayed. However, the number of Japanese troops in these places is not large, and there is no difficulty in withdrawing them outside the pass. Waiting for the construction of barracks is clearly an excuse. Therefore, when the passes will be taken over by us is still a question. Okamura, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, previously discussed the handover of the Great Wall passes with our authorities in Beiping. Although he stated that there was no problem, he also expressed concerns during the conversation. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The establishment of customs at the Great Wall passes, due to its relationship to the tax revenue of North China, has been decided to be established. However, in order to avoid de facto recognition of the puppet state, its name has been determined to be the Taihai and Jinhai sub-customs. Zhang Yongnian, an investigator from the Ministry of Finance, and Huo Degguang, the secretary of the Jidong Administrative Commissioner's Office, went to Gubeikou this morning and then went to various passes to investigate. After their return, preparations for the establishment will begin. If postal services are implemented, it would be tantamount to violating the League of Nations resolution. Therefore, the negotiations on this matter have been abandoned. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The problem of opening traffic and postal services on the Beining Railway is still unresolved. A reporter from a certain agency visited an important figure in the central government and inquired about his views on this matter. According to him, more than two years have passed since the fall of the three northeastern provinces. The central government has never had the intention of abandoning the three northeastern provinces or recognizing the puppet state. Therefore, the people of the three northeastern provinces are all compatriots and of course have the right to postal and traffic communication with the country. As for the people within the country, since they do not regard the three northeastern provinces as Manchukuo, how can there not be postal and traffic communication within the same country? Otherwise, it would be tantamount to tacitly acknowledging that the three northeastern provinces have become Manchukuo. The central government, in view of this, is trying to negotiate the terms. If traffic outside the pass can be opened under the name of the Beining Railway, and not under the name of the Fengshan Railway inside the pass, and postal services can be opened at the same time, it may be handled by the Beiping Political Council as a local matter and conducted nearby. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Reports state that the Ministry of Finance has dispatched Deputy Tax Commissioner Zhang Yongping to Beiping to investigate the establishment of customs at the Great Wall passes and plans to establish seven large and small sub-customs at Yu Guan, Lengkou, Xifengkou, Gubeikou, Yiyuan Kou, Jieling Kou, and Panjiakou. Northeastern products will still be taxed as domestic goods, and Japanese goods will be taxed as foreign goods. According to an official from the Ministry of Finance, Zhang Yongping was sent to Beiping to investigate the tax situation of various customs in North China. The establishment of customs at the Great Wall passes is being drafted in detail by the Customs Administration. It is not as accurate as reported. Judging from the current situation, the time for realization still needs to wait. As for the countermeasures against the establishment of customs checkpoints by the puppet organization at the Great Wall passes, it is a central government issue, and this department is not in a position to express opinions. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the diplomatic issues in North China, such as traffic, postal services, and the establishment of customs, opinions are divided after several discussions by the central government. Except for traffic, which has been deemed unavoidable, the Japanese and puppet regimes also plan to establish customs along the Great Wall passes in the Rehe area, hoping to create a state of confrontation. Our side believes that if this is true, it will be difficult to recognize and there is no way to start negotiations. As for postal services, since our country has joined the Universal Postal Convention, in order to maintain the prestige of the League of Nations resolution, it may be difficult to accept unless it is under certain principles of our country. However, the Japanese side does not attach great importance to postal services and customs. Therefore, it is expected that the foreign affairs in North China, except for traffic, other issues will be temporarily suspended for discussion. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi of the Ministry of Finance summoned Shen Shuyu on the 15th to discuss the establishment of customs by the puppet regime at the Great Wall. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, Japanese sources have widely spread the news that the Japanese side will conduct negotiations with our government on traffic, postal services, and the establishment of customs. On the 15th, according to a responsible statement from the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since the cessation of hostilities in North China, the authorities in North China have negotiated with the Japanese on matters such as bandit suppression and have achieved results. The return of the Great Wall passes has also been agreed upon with the Japanese side, but the time for handover has not yet arrived. The spokesman continued that regardless of whether the Japanese have this plan for traffic, postal services, and customs, the Japanese side has not made such a proposal, so there is no so-called negotiation, let alone any progress.

<p>(Nanjing) At the Central Political Council meeting on the 15th, the principles of traffic, postal services, customs and other issues proposed by various ministries were reported by the chairman and referred to a committee for review. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council held its 383rd meeting on the morning of the 15th. The meeting was attended by members Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Gu Mengyu, Ye Chucang, Kong Xiangxi, Shi Ying, Chen Gongbo, Shi Qingyang, Zhu Jiahua, Zhao Yuanzhong, Ma Chaojun, Jiao Yitang, Zhu Peide, Chen Lifu, Zeng Zhongming, Tang Youren, Duan Xipeng, Chen Shuren, Qin Zhen, Zhang Daofan, Wang Qi, Ding Chaowu, Li Ciwen, Gu Zhenggang, Miao Peicheng, Xiao Jishan and more than 30 other people, chaired by Standing Committee member Sun Ke. The following important cases were decided: (1) Committee member and Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Zhaoming proposed to amend the organization of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee of the Executive Yuan. Except for the Secretariat, which should still be established, the Political Affairs Office and the Finance Office should be abolished immediately. A Counselor's Office, an Investigation Office, and a North China Construction Discussion Committee should be established instead, and a draft of the revised outline of the organization of the Council should be prepared for public decision. The resolution was passed. (2) The principles of the Stamp Tax Law were approved in eleven articles and submitted to the Legislative Yuan. (3) Nine draft budgets of various agencies were approved. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Conference passed the revised organizational outline of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee of the Executive Yuan on the 15th. The full text of the revised organization is recorded as follows: (1) The Executive Yuan has specially established the Beiping Political Affairs According to Theory Committee of the Executive Yuan to reorganize the political affairs of the northern provinces and cities. (2) The Council shall have twenty-three members, one of whom shall be designated as the chairman of the Council. The candidate shall be nominated by the President of the Executive Yuan and approved by the Central Political Conference, and then specially appointed by the National Government. (3) The Chairman shall be responsible for the affairs of the Council. (4) The Council shall meet once a month, convened by the Chairman, and its rules of procedure shall be determined separately. (5) The Council shall have one office and two departments as follows: 1. Counselor's Office, 2. Secretariat, 3. Investigation Department. (6) The Council shall have a Chief Counselor who shall be responsible for the affairs of the Counselor's Office, a Secretary-General who shall be responsible for the affairs of the Secretariat, and a Director of Investigation who shall be responsible for the affairs of the Investigation Department. If necessary, assistant managers and deputy directors may be appointed, and detailed rules of organization shall be determined separately. (7) When necessary, consultants and advisors may be appointed. (8) The Council shall establish a North China Construction Discussion Committee to improve the government's progress with scholarship. (9) Within the scope of not conflicting with central laws and regulations, the Council may formulate separate regulations and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. (10) The detailed rules of procedure of the Council shall be determined separately. (11) This provisional organizational outline shall be implemented from the date of its promulgation. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Political Reorganization Committee previously intended to reorganize internally due to financial difficulties. The Executive Yuan meeting some days ago also revised the organizational regulations of the Council, but they have not yet been received. It is recently heard that the Council has only reduced its scope and there has been no major change. Wang Kemin will be transferred to the post of Chief Counselor. According to political news, the rumor of Huang Fu being passive is absolutely inaccurate. Since Huang moved to the Foreign Affairs Building, he has personally supervised various departments to handle official affairs every day. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After He previously convened a meeting of generals to discuss and reduce the military expenses of the North China armies, the total amount is still around 4.5 million yuan. In addition to the 2 million yuan assisted by the central government each month, Hebei Province assists with 500,000 yuan per month, Chahar Province 300,000 yuan, Beiping City 50,000 yuan, Tianjin City 60,000 yuan, the Beining Railway Bureau 140,000 yuan, and the Ping Sui Railway Bureau 50,000 yuan, totaling 1.1 million yuan. This amount is allocated on a monthly basis and is still far from enough. Now Hebei and Chahar have many accidents and cannot allocate as planned. The North China military pavilions have only been issued six times this year, and there are still three times that have not been issued. He Yingqin went to Tianjin on the 13th. In addition to visiting friends, he also met with Yu Song once, hoping that Hebei Province will continue to allocate 500,000 yuan and Chahar Province 300,000 yuan to meet the urgent needs of the armies.

<p>(Beiping) The traffic between Beiping and Shenyang is now being negotiated by the Beining Railway Bureau, the Japanese Kwantung Army, and the South Manchuria Railway Company. In general, an appropriate method will be adopted to implement traffic. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong arrived in Beiping tonight. According to him, he has not made any concrete progress on the issue of traffic between Beiping and Shenyang. The central government has sent experts to study it, and no decision has been made yet. The negotiation policy is also the direct responsibility of the government. The claim that traffic between Beiping and Shenyang will be established on the first of next month is not true, because everything has not been decided yet. The handover of the Great Wall passes and other issues are being negotiated. He will stay in Beiping for about one or two days and then return to Tianjin after the matter is completed. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong, the Director of the Beining Bureau, said that the traffic between Beiping and Shenyang must wait for the central government's order. The traffic plan proposed by this bureau has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways. Due to its importance, it must be discussed and approved by the Central Political Council before it can be announced. It is difficult to announce it now. (15th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Problem of Controlled Economy <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Cun</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai yarn industry, due to the Cotton Industry Control Committee's move to stabilize yarn prices, ordered the exchange to refuse new cotton yarn delivered by customer manufacturers from November to December of this year. This caused a huge uproar. Afterwards, the Cotton Industry Control Committee announced the process of handling this matter on the 12th of this month. In our observation, this is actually a matter that cannot be ignored in the process of implementing controlled economy after the establishment of the National Economic Commission.</p>
<p>Advanced capitalist countries today, such as Germany, Italy, Britain and the United States, have all adopted a policy of actively intervening in national economic facilities in recent years. This is where the slogan of controlled economy chanted by European and American countries after the occurrence of the economic panic comes from. And its goal is nothing more than to raise or stabilize prices in order to restore social prosperity. In terms of its methods, there are thousands of strands, and the meticulous calculations are all based on suitability for the country as a prerequisite. It is impossible to imitate arbitrarily and expect unexpected gains, and the reasons for the occurrence of their panic seem to have other real reasons at the root. This one problem alone cannot save it.</p>
<p>If we talk about the future of the so-called controlled economy plan in light of our country's current national conditions, it is not easy to be optimistic. First, the government's financial resources are exhausted. At present, the central government's income and expenditure are not small, reaching about 200 million a year. The government's own expenses are not easy to maintain. Where does the surplus power come from to save today's panic? Seeking to spend money like the governments of European and American countries to equalize prices and manipulate exchange rates, which exceeds hundreds of millions, is certainly not something that can be said in today's China. Second, the weakness of our country's financial efforts is also undeniable. The current status of the financial industry is not only hindered by the continuous economic depression of industry and commerce, but also unable to seek self-rescue due to the concentration of financial resources of foreign banks. If the authorities only advocate the movement of controlled economy, without a strong financial organization to dominate the operation of the national economy, the result may be nothing more than wasting expenses. Third, the dumping of foreign goods is also a major obstacle. In recent years, the spread of domestic depression is due to the increasingly narrow sales of important commodities, which leads to overproduction in the country. The reasons for causing overproduction, such as the loss of markets in the Northeast, the bankruptcy of rural villages in the interior, and the development of foreign factories, are all obvious facts. And especially the increase in foreign goods is not to be underestimated. If the authorities really want to seek price stability and economic control, they must first make the production of foreign factories and the import of foreign goods subject to appropriate regulation, otherwise the so-called control will only benefit other countries, and it will be of no benefit to our industry, commerce, or the people.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we hope for from the government today is that in order to carry out a controlled economy and realize price stability, it must establish a comprehensive plan that cannot be limited to the issue of collecting several tens of thousands of bags of yarn. It should focus on the various reasons for the decline in yarn prices and try to find fundamental solutions.</p>
<h3 id="e18">With Firm and Euphemistic Wording, France Replies to Hitler: It Will Never Abandon the League of Nations and Disarmament; It Is Ready to Open Negotiations with Germany at Any Time; It Is Difficult to Agree to Equality Without Guaranteed Security <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, after the Chamber of Deputies debated foreign policy, it passed a vote of confidence in the Sarraut government by a large majority, with 395 votes in favor and 154 votes against. The motion called on the government's policy to be loyal to the League of Nations, to expand France's friendship, to act for international unity, and to be vigilant in seeking equality and security for all nations, and to realize fair disarmament. The left wing and the left-center party voted in favor of the government, while the right wing and the right-center party voted against. In his speech at the end of the debate, Premier Sarraut said that the government's reply to Hitler could be summed up in one sentence: fearless. But at the same time, it contained the desire to save peace through Geneva and to reach an understanding with Germany. Sarraut advised France, which has material and military strength, to rise up to prevent any narrow-minded dictators and to remain calm. He continued that if France wants to continue to conclude peace and security agreements, France must make concessions. Although less than yesterday, he is willing to announce to the world that France will never abandon Geneva and will never abandon the League of Nations Disarmament Conference. Sarraut also solemnly declared that the Chamber of Deputies unanimously opposed the "war-stopping settlement" and knew that the alliance system could not succeed because it was too weak. In response to Hitler's expression of his desire for peace and understanding, Sarraut said that France also shared this desire, but France and the countries that signed the agreement on Germany's request for equality and reciprocity would say "No" to them as long as the security issue was set aside for a long time. Sarraut added that France is ready to talk to Germany, but it must be done through normal channels and in the light of international agreements. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) As mentioned in the previous telegram, the Chamber of Deputies voted in favor of the government's motion yesterday. Before the vote, Premier Sarraut took the stage to give a speech, saying that the relationship between France and Germany is a matter of peace. Some people have heard that after the German referendum, what does the French government intend to do? We answered that what the government should do is first to remain calm and not to disturb anyone, so as to calmly wait for the development of the situation. This is extremely easy, because France has 40 million people, and its material and military strength are sufficient to defend itself without fear of others adding violence. France's desire for peace has been consistent from beginning to end, and has not changed at all at present. The result of the German referendum only makes France's aspirations more determined. France will not retreat on anything that should not be conceded.</p>

<p>The League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference have always been France's shield. The attitude of France's allies and the United Nations may waver. We must strive to maintain a unified stance. These countries each have their concerns, and we must understand them, not hastily blame them. However, for their benefit, they should unite with France and maintain European peace with a frank attitude, even where global peace is threatened. This is what all allies and the United Nations should understand. (Applause in the chamber.) The brewing disaster can only be avoided by all nations reaching a proper agreement. France's policies can gain the support of most countries in the world. France's national strength is sufficiently robust to protect its legitimate rights. As for armaments, there must be solid guarantees before France will agree to reductions. Sarraut continued, viewing the progress of the Disarmament Conference, if a disarmament convention is to be established and Germany is to participate (if Germany truly desires to maintain peace), it should be based on the points already agreed upon by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy. Sarraut reiterated Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour's declaration, saying that the government will never disregard any proposals beneficial to peace. Then, he addressed the German people, saying:</p>
<h3 id="e21">French Prime Minister's Message to the German People <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>You say you aspire to peace, but are the hopes of the French people any different? The spirit of Briand's policies lies entirely in this. We hold the same thoughts towards Germany. We absolutely do not wish for the decline of Germany. Germany, a nation of sixty million people, to wish for its demise, ask yourselves, could the French people entertain such a delusion? France genuinely desires Germany to enjoy its rightful rights. France is not insensitive to Germany's suffering. France will not hinder Germany's economic development. Therefore, France at all times and in all places wants to approach France and reach a compromise.</p>
<p>After this explanation, we have the right to declare that France should, based on this spirit of compromise, seek to resolve the issue of equal rights to armaments. Germany, based on the declaration of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy on December 11 of the seventh year, demands equal rights to armaments. It must be understood that equality of armaments must be exchanged for security to be implemented. These two things are closely related and indispensable. However, Germany only demands equality of armaments and disregards security. This is not something France can accept. Such one-sided equality of armaments will not only be rejected by France but also probably not recognized by the countries that signed the declaration of December 11 last year.</p>
<p>Despite this, France is still prepared to negotiate, but with two conditions: (1) The talks must be conducted in the full view of the international community and must respect countries with special ties to France. (2) What exactly is to be negotiated? France should know this beforehand. What is the basis for the negotiations that Germany wants to conduct? This must be clearly stated. After these two conditions are met, France will return to Geneva to continue working on the construction of peace. Whether Germany participates or not is acceptable. In this way, France can once again show the world the righteousness of its intentions. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, with resolute but moderate words, responded to German Chancellor Hitler's speech on Sunday, saying that France has no other course of action except to abide by the conventions concluded by the League of Nations in broad daylight. France is prepared to negotiate at any time, but any agreement between France and Germany must be concluded in Geneva. The order and security of Europe are now in danger due to Germany's fanatical nationalism. The neighboring countries of Germany are expressing anxiety, and not without reason. If Germany re-arms, then France must also add armaments, and the result will be extremely fierce competition. But each country has ambassadors stationed. If France receives any concrete proposals from Germany, France is willing to consider them in the spirit that it has always treated this great nation, because it knows that the peace of Europe largely depends on relations with Germany. Paul-Boncour spoke at length on the international situation and continued, saying that France's responsibility is to protect the French in the Saar region. The joint responsibility of the French government and the League of Nations is to monitor the Saar plebiscite held in 1935 to ensure that it is based on genuine popular will.

<p>(Paris) A major debate on foreign policy was held in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon. As a result of the final vote, the Chamber expressed its confidence in the government by a majority of 395 votes to 194. The details of the debate are recorded below. The Chamber of Deputies convened at 3:10 p.m. The number of attendees was high. Initially, the number of parliamentarians who attended was small, but the seat filled up quickly. Prime Minister Sarraut, Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, and cabinet members entered the hall one after another, and sat in government seats. Then, Socialist Party Member Nogaro spoke first, followed by a speech by Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, who said that Hitler's revolution in Germany had been recognized by the people in last week's vote. Germany's demands will become more urgent. Although the speeches of various important figures in the German authorities have repeatedly stated their desire for peace, the principles of victory in Germany contain various dangers. Neighboring countries of Germany cannot but pay attention to it diplomatically. Although Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it has never changed its policy towards nations who are sympathetic to Geneva. France advocates continuing disarmament work and striving for the establishment of a disarmament convention, and has always believed that it is appropriate to unite all countries so that a disarmament convention can be concluded. We are unwilling to bear any responsibility for Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference.</p>

<p>However, since the principles of offensive and defensive alliances between countries before the European War have been prohibited by the League of Nations, we can only try to develop new treaties concluded within the League of Nations. For example, the Locarno Treaty is still completely intact. This treaty is still a guarantee treaty for our country, and the same is true for Germany. Its value is equal to the treaty that guaranteed Belgium's neutrality before the European War. The reason why the United Kingdom participated in the war with all its strength was to fulfill such treaties.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the Four-Power Pact eliminated misunderstandings between us and Italy. This treaty is implemented in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations. The reason why this treaty does not hinder the relationship between France and the Little Entente countries and Poland is precisely because of this. Moreover, the French government is not only willing to overturn its current diplomatic policy but also wants to promote diplomatic relations and compromises with foreign countries. France's new friendships are increasing day by day, but old friendships remain unchanged.</p>

<p>As for Germany, if it wants to change its mind and is willing to cooperate with countries that are determined to maintain peace, Germany is free to do so. The key lies entirely in Germany itself. France adopts a "be there any time" policy for diplomatic negotiations, but if there is a compromise, it must first consult with countries that will clearly conclude a treaty with France within the scope of the League of Nations before proceeding. We will implement all these policies with all our strength and enthusiasm. Please judge whether it is appropriate.</p>

<p>After Paul-Boncour finished speaking, Fabry, a member of the Republican Center Party, said that Germany's arms manufacturing capacity is superior to France's, and France's population is smaller than Germany's. (According to the report, France's population is 40 million, and Germany's is 65 million.) France's borders are vulnerable to attack in many places. Equality of armaments is actually disadvantageous to France. Therefore, France hopes that the government will not reduce its armaments. Socialist Party member Nenjay and former Prime Minister Tardieu spoke briefly one after another. Finally, Puy-Homme, a member who does not represent any political party, delivered a speech, launching a fierce attack on the Sarraut government, and said that the Treaty of Versailles prohibited military training outside of the army, but the governments of various countries failed to effectively implement the treaty, causing Germany to violate it. Puy-Homme also attacked the Four-Power Pact, and said that the trial period for the arms inspection system was opposed by the United Kingdom. Minister of the Army Ladreit de Lacharrière then presented and read out the record of the Anglo-French talks on September 23, which clearly stated that British Foreign Secretary Simon unconditionally agreed to the four-year arms inspection trial period and the dissolution of military groups outside the German regular army. When the Chamber of Deputies continued to meet in the evening, Prime Minister Sarraut said that France's spiritual, material, and military strength are sufficient to continue to engage in international cooperation. Then, a vote was taken to express confidence in the government's proposal, which was passed by a majority of 395 votes to 194. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>Rome. Today, Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech at the National Council of Corporations, first stating that "the existence of capitalism has experienced a crisis." Mussolini believed that capitalism, in order to maintain itself, wants to maintain continuous consumption. Unexpectedly, supply exceeds demand, so production cannot be sold. Capitalism is turning to the state for help. The crisis in Europe is not only a panic for capitalism, but also involves political and cultural issues. Those who control the world are no longer the European continent. West of the Atlantic, a new continent has risen to compete for hegemony. Japan in the Far East has also made great progress. Japanese silk fabrics have been sold in Italian markets. The Prime Minister then stated that the National Council of Corporations is specifically a kind of political organization and conference, and what it is committed to will be the issue of the European political crisis. The Prime Minister said, "Europe can still save itself, but there must be a minimum degree of compromise among all nations, and it must be effective. However, the League of Nations has now lost its meaning. The various principles of the League of Nations are all good, but it has no power to implement them. As for the Four-Power Pact, although no one praises it, it has never been forgotten in everyone's mind."</p>

<p>In the second part of his speech, the Prime Minister explained the organization of Italian corporations, briefly saying, "Even if Italy has the possibility of implementing capitalism, it is unwilling to do so. Italy should be a country with a mixed economy, and focus on agriculture." The Prime Minister then declared that the Chamber of Deputies will be dissolved after its current term expires. This kind of parliament is an organ for enemy parties to govern, and is fundamentally opposed to pan-nationalism. After its abolition, it will be replaced by the National Council of Corporations. Mussolini concluded that "we are now abolishing economic liberalism and adopting a corporatist policy. In other words, it is controlling the economy. Socialism and economic liberalism grew up at the same time, declined at the same time, and corporatism will rise to replace them. The world economic panic has reached this point, and corporatism will inevitably be adopted by the world." (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>"Rome" Prime Minister Mussolini's speech at the National Council of Corporations has been seen in the previous telegram. The following is an excerpt from the speech, which originally stated that "Japan in the Far East, after its contact with Europe through the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, has taken steps to advance westward. This is actually a political issue. The reason why we regard it as a political issue is because Japan's contact with Europe is actually of a political nature. Today, if Europe can find the minimum level of political organization, then Europe can still try to regain the helm of the world's culture. What we relied on in the past as a permanent standard should still be followed today, but to achieve the realization of European political understanding, we must correct the injustices of the past, because a kind of injustice has now created an extremely serious situation."

<p>Brussels Belgian Senator Allart made a statement to the committees of the two houses of parliament, saying that he had obtained the report of the Inter-Allied Military Control Commission, which was made by British General Morgan in 1927. The report was obtained from the Allied side, and only the governments of the Allied countries have a copy, which has not been published. Its contents prove that Germany has not disarmed in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. The last chapter of the report was published in "La Nation Belge" this morning. The title of the last chapter of 比利時民族 is "Summary and Conclusions." The content summarizes the facts obtained from the investigation and various reservations, stating that the inspection is limited to the externally visible stored weapons, so the inspection results can only obtain relative truth. Germany has a large amount of weapons stored, and many hidden military materials. The annual military budget has increased. Despite repeated protests from the Inspection Commission and repeated warnings from the Allied governments, they were ignored. The actual amount used for armaments is very large, and cannot be concealed even by disguising it as normal expenses. The clauses in the peace treaty regarding the construction of barracks and other military buildings have not been implemented. The regulations of the People's National Defence Forces, which are formulated in accordance with the troop levels, weapons, and military needs of large countries, have not been modified in accordance with the provisions of the peace treaty. The report concludes that, under the current circumstances, no one can automatically declare that Germany has at least implemented the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles in spirit. It must be until the various corrections that the report indicates as necessary have made great progress, and until it can finally be considered to have reached the disarmament stage expected by the Treaty of Versailles, before this is possible. But now Germany is still very far from this stage. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(London) Today in the House of Commons, British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas claimed that three bills currently proposed by the Irish Free State parliament seek to amend the constitution and, in the view of the British government, are related to the revocation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. This bill seeks to transfer the power of the British representative to propose appropriation funds to the Executive Council, abolish the British representative's right to veto bills, and abolish the right to appeal to the Privy Council. From the meaning of this case, it can also be seen that South Ireland clearly intends to gradually delete the royal power from the constitution. The purpose of Eamon de Valera, President of the South Irish government, is to create a united Irish Republic under the British Empire. This kind of approach is absolutely not to be recognized. According to the declaration of the 1926 Imperial Conference, the relationship between the United Kingdom and the self-governing territories under the Crown must recognize that the Irish Free State, according to its legal status, is not within the scope of the Empire. Since the Free State is completely free to self-govern its internal affairs, other parts of the Empire are given great convenience. The Free State is now losing the benefits of being ordinary citizens and the economic preferences in trade with other parts of the Empire through its own actions, and will lose the opportunity to exercise its power in international affairs. All these privileges and responsibilities coexist. What are the responsibilities? Namely, to respect royal power, faithfully abide by contracts, and express friendship and cooperation with other parts of the Empire. The British government wants to see the Free State occupy a complete position in the British Empire, accept its responsibilities, and enjoy its privileges. But if the Free State abandons its responsibilities, it cannot hope to enjoy privileges. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) South Ireland's intention to delete royal power from the constitution is now making the situation between Britain and Ireland increasingly critical. If the Free State insists on its own way, serious consequences will inevitably occur. President of the Free State de Valera told a Reuters reporter in Dublin that his answer to the remarks of British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas was clearly decided by the Irish people in 1918. Those who agreed to the 1921 treaty abandoned the republic in order to avoid the terrible war threatened by then British Prime Minister George. The British government has always claimed that if the Irish people exercise their basic right to choose their own constitution, Britain will regard it as an act of hostility and take it as a reason for aggression. If the British government declares tomorrow that the declaration of a republic is not a reason for an aggressive hostile act, then this matter can be resolved. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The International Silk Congress opened here today. It is currently discussing the competition of Japanese goods in the world silk market. The discussion is centered on the proposals put forward by the London Silk Association, the Lyon Silk Manufacturers Association, and the Swiss Silk Manufacturers Association, which call for revising the ratio of Japanese natural silk and artificial silk fabric imports. Speakers all said that it is impossible to compete in the open market with the products of countries with low living costs and labor conditions that cannot be compared with those of Europe and the United States. The proposal stated that the ratio is based on the average number of silk exports from Japan from 192 to 1931. Representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Switzerland attended the congress. (National Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Anglo-American-Japanese Naval Competition: United Kingdom Unwilling to Be Weaker Than United States and Japan; Decides to Build Three Large Cruisers <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(London) After careful consideration of the cruiser programs of countries such as Japan and the United States, the British Admiralty has decided to revise the 1933 program, including two new cruisers of approximately nine thousand tons and improved armaments, and one Arethusa-class cruiser of five thousand two hundred tons. This news was announced today in the House of Commons by Secretary of the Admiralty Monsell. Monsell claimed that the government's previous decision to build cruisers of smaller tonnage was in the hope that other countries would do the same. In July last year, the British representative in Geneva proposed reducing future cruisers to seven thousand tons, with a maximum cannon bore of six o'clock. It was also hoped that this proposal would be accepted by all countries. Unfortunately, neither of the above two hopes was realized. In 1931, Japan built two cruisers of eight thousand five hundred tons each, armed with fifteen six-inch guns. The British government has now heard that Japan is building two cruisers of the same tonnage again, and plans to add two more, for a total of six. The United States has also stated that it plans to build four ten thousand ton cruisers, each carrying fifteen six-inch guns. If the previously approved British program is implemented, the new British cruisers will be far inferior to other countries. (According to the report, the original British program included one 7250-ton cruiser with 8-inch guns and three 5400-ton cruisers with 6-inch guns.) The total tonnage of British cruisers is limited by the London Naval Treaty, putting it in a dilemma. If the original program is followed, the ships built will be inferior to certain cruisers built by other countries. If cruisers comparable to other countries are built, the four ships must be reduced to three. The Admiralty has repeatedly considered that it is better to have fewer ships than to have ships that are inferior in strength to other countries. Therefore, it has decided to propose revising the 1933 program. This revision will increase the cost of the 1933 program and is expected to slightly reduce the number of cruisers that Japan and the United States can build in accordance with the London Naval Treaty. However, the British government's policy will continue to strive to limit the larger number of ships and the maximum tonnage per ship by common agreement. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Stalin's report on the achievements of the Five-Year Plan to the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party in January this year has now been translated into Chinese by the Moscow Foreign Workers Publishing House and printed in five thousand copies. (National Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The Admiralty's decision to build larger cruisers to prevent naval powers from exceeding the strength of the United Kingdom is reviewed by various parties who believe that naval competition has already begun. Although the competitors are still restraining themselves, they will eventually let go. Naval and other circles welcomed the decision and called it the best possible step in an intolerable situation. They hope that those who like to talk about intimidation will not take this as a sign of war. Earl Jellicoe and Lord Beatty were very pleased. One repeatedly stated that the unsafety and inadequacy of the cruisers accepted by the United Kingdom under the London Naval Treaty and demanded that the United Kingdom should at least have this type of cruiser, seventy ships. Washington naval personnel did not panic upon hearing the news of the British revision of the naval program, acknowledging that this was an action within the rights of the British Treaty. Whatever happens, the United States will hold the helm of the world's navy when the naval treaty is reconsidered in 1936. British conservatives are deeply disappointed that the United Kingdom is involved in a policy that obstructs the great road of disarmament and that Japan and the United States desire. The Daily News said that if the United Kingdom does not want to go to war with Japan or the United States, it does not see the shipbuilding programs of the two countries as a reason for harming the United Kingdom. If the United Kingdom wants to go to war, what is the benefit of building two more cruisers? (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Washington) It is reported that the talks between the U.S. President and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov have expanded to include the issue of religious freedom in Russia.  It is said that the U.S. President requested that Litvinov ensure that American citizens in Russia be allowed freedom of religion and not be subject to interference from Russian Party doctrines. However, those close to both sides maintain that while negotiations are progressing slowly, progress is being made steadily. The slow progress is attributed to the desire for a thorough discussion of all aspects of U.S.-Russian relations.  White House sources still believe the talks will conclude satisfactorily by Friday evening. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Soviet Russian official representatives and U.S. authorities continue to study the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia, as well as various other issues, preparing to reach a compromise before President Roosevelt leaves Washington on Friday.  However, the movement opposing recognition of Soviet Russia is growing daily.  This movement is centered around New York State Representative Fish, who opposes Soviet Russia, and the "American Coalition." This coalition is composed of 1,500 patriotic individuals and religious figures opposed to communism.  The head of the coalition, former Chief of Staff General Harbord, declared yesterday that he would begin an anti-recognition of Soviet Russia movement, planning to deliver speeches weekly to awaken public opinion, so that the recognition of Soviet Russia will not be approved by the Senate in the future. Congressman Fish plans to use radio for propaganda.  The leader of the American Legion, Hayes, will also deliver speeches in succession.  According to the secretary of the "American Coalition," thousands of protest letters opposing recognition of Soviet Russia have been sent to the White House. However, the government has not yet paid attention to this movement. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(London) Today, the United States is buying gold coins and British pounds here, while continental Europe is also purchasing British pounds.

<p>(New York) Government bonds continue to fall. Officials believe that, according to official sources, if a choice must be made between purchasing gold to raise prices and not purchasing gold to maintain government bond prices, then they would favor abandoning the gold purchase plan, but the time for such a move has not yet arrived. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(New York) The price of newly mined American gold is the same as yesterday, remaining at $33.56. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although the U.S. dollar has fallen to its lowest value in 68 years today, the government has not yet expressed any intention to change its plan. On the contrary, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is purchasing domestically mined gold at an upward trend. Therefore, financial and economic experts believe that this is a sign that the U.S. President is determined to implement the foreign gold purchase plan, and believe that the government is now completely united on monetary policy. When the U.S. President initiated the gold purchase plan, hoping to raise world prices to help boost domestic prices, some senior officials in the Treasury Department inevitably remained skeptical, deeply fearing that the continued decline of the gold dollar would actually endanger the country's financial recovery. Since then, the conservatives, led by Woodin, have acknowledged complete satisfaction with the President's plan, and their doubts about the impact of the gold purchase plan on government credit have also gradually dissipated, because the recent sharp decline in government bonds is due to a lack of buyers, not selling pressure.

In recent years, Mexico's influence among Latin American countries has been increasing, and it will be one of the most influential members of the Pan-American Conference.

<p>A Harbin dispatch from the North China Daily News on the 5th states that Japanese Major General Tashiro recently flew from Qiqihar to Sakhalin Island and back to inspect the situation on both banks of the Heilongjiang River. According to his report after returning to Qiqihar, Soviet Russian military preparations far exceeded his expectations. For example, the left bank of the Heilongjiang River, opposite the Manchurian border, is covered with barbed wire for several miles, so that no one can cross into Russian territory after the river freezes. Along the river, strong fortresses are set up at intervals, either built with cement or just earthen fortifications, turning the riverbank into a line of fortresses. Only the Soviet Russian side of the river has frozen, and it is expected that the entire river will freeze within a week. Within two weeks, the army can cross over the ice. Soviet Russia has clearly prepared for this unexpected danger, without a doubt. Recently, the railway bureau authorities have been very frugal, resulting in the Chinese Eastern Railway having only enough coal for eight days. Due to the shortage of coal, some trains have been ordered to burn firewood, so that regular passenger and freight trains will not have a coal shortage. The Mutanjiang coal mine is difficult to protect from bandits, but is still operating as usual. The Zhalainuo'er coal mine is also operating as usual, but shipments from the south seem to have decreased. It is said that this is due to the frequent transportation of Japanese troops and supplies, resulting in insufficient freight cars. In the past three weeks, White Russians in Harbin have been moving south to find work in various parts of China, especially Shanghai. However, some are now returning, claiming that there is nothing to be found in Shanghai, and it is better to return to Harbin.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) In order to understand the financial situation of each province and rectify the tax authorities under his jurisdiction, Kong Xiangxi will soon convene the heads of the finance departments of each province, as well as customs and other tax personnel from various regions, to inquire about everything. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Ministry of Finance reduced the scope of customs administration, the authority was focused on the General Inspectorate. Previously, plans were made to rectify anti-smuggling and improve tax police, but the General Inspectorate concurrently manages administration, and its strength is not sufficient, resulting in tax police service being negligent and the effectiveness of anti-smuggling not improving. Now, the General Inspectorate is reiterating its previous order, stipulating measures that the heads of each tax police force, deputy directors, and district chiefs should pay close attention to external work and frequently inspect each district team, so as to achieve effective rectification. If the heads and deputy directors of each tax police force are found to have not inspected the entire territory and the district chiefs have not inspected the entire district twice every six months, they will be deemed negligent in their duties and ineffective in their work, and they will be ordered to report the dates of their inspections at any time for record.

Around 7:00 AM that morning, Chairman of the Provincial Government Fu Zuoyi, Commander of the 70th Division Wang Qingguo, Director of Civil Affairs Yuan Qingzeng, and Prince A, among others, arrived at the Suiyuan Hotel to see Huang and his party off. Huang and Zhao's escort detail, originally transferred from Fu Zuoyi's troops, had already been led to Bailingmiao by Li Songfeng on the 9th. When Huang and his party departed on the 10th, they were escorted by Xu Tingyao's guards along the way. Two heavy-duty trucks carried armed soldiers, and machine guns were mounted on the front of the vehicles. After they departed, they closely followed Huang's car. A team of police bicycle patrolmen from the Public Security Bureau also arrived at the Suiyuan Hotel early in the morning to provide security and welcome them. At 8:20 AM, after Huang and Zhao boarded the car and departed, the police officers on duty along the street blew whistles to maintain order, creating a solemn atmosphere. Before departing, Huang indicated that he did not wish to express any opinions and would return to Suiyuan after a short stay of a few days in Bailingmiao, his attitude was extremely silent. Huang and Zhao rode together in Fu Zuoyi's new car, Xu Tingyao rode in another car, and the remaining staff members rode in larger long-distance buses.

<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since the beginning of the month, the pseudo-Front Army in the eastern border area of Zixi, Lichuan, Nancheng, and Nanfeng has repeatedly sent small groups of bandits to harass the positions of the National Army, intending to probe the National Army's strength and weaknesses, and then concentrate on attacking a single point. Therefore, the bandits' tracks are extremely elusive, but the National Army is waiting for them and the bandits cannot succeed. Finally, on the 10th of this month, with the pseudo-15th Army Corps in the rear and the pseudo-37th Army Corps in front, they began to advance westward, hiding during the day and moving at night, rushing into Jinxi. Commander-in-Chief Jiang and Commander Gu clearly saw through the bandits' schemes, so they ordered the troops stationed in various streams and locations in Lichuan to pretend not to resist and allow them to pass through the defensive positions. At the same time, they ordered a certain unit in Jinxi to falsely retreat towards the Linchuan border. The Red bandits did not realize this and went deep, vainly attempting to directly attack the rear of Fuzhou. Peng Dehuai, Fang Zhimin, and Su Jingguang, the bandit leaders, personally led the pseudo-37th Army Corps and the 19th and 20th Divisions, taking positions in Bogan and Zuofang, and advancing to Jinxi. On the 12th, they attacked Xuwang via Fengshubu. On the 13th, the southern part of the National Army's 4th Division, Xing Zhennan, advanced diagonally from the border between 　xi and Jinxi, cutting off the bandits' connection with the pseudo-5th Army Corps and blocking their retreat. The National Army, which had retreated 　Xuwang, changed retreat to advance, and attacked the bandits together with Xing's division. From the 13th, the bandits repeatedly charged back and forth near Xuwang, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The National Army fired their guns and artillery in unison, with bullets raining down. The air force also mobilized, using large bombers loaded with over 120 pounds of bombs, flying over the Jin　area, concentrating fire and bombing the bandits' dense formations. At the same time, a batch of fresh troops was transferred from a certain location and joined the front line, greatly boosting morale. After a fierce battle for a day and night, by noon on the 14th, the National Army had completely annihilated the pseudo-37th Army Corps. The pseudo-19th and 20th Divisions suffered heavy losses and were unable to fight any longer. The remaining bandits retreated in defeat to the southeastern and northeastern borders of Fujian. In total, over 3,000 bandits were killed, over 100 bandits were captured, over 1,000 bandit corpses were left on the battlefield, and over 800 guns and dozens of foreign rifles were seized. The large number of guns captured was the only significant gain since the fifth general offensive. After Jiang received the phone call from Fuzhou, he broadcast a radio message from the headquarters at 8:30 PM on the 14th, reporting on the bloody battles of the 13th and 14th, stating that the 　of Jinxi, the pseudo-37th Army Corps had been completely cut off by our 4th Division, and then fiercely attacked by our various armies near Fengshanbu in Xuwang, killing over 3,000 bandits and seizing over 800 guns. In the future, all officers and soldiers only need to focus on eliminating the pseudo-1st Army Corps to complete the bandit suppression mission, consolidate the national foundation, and comfort the hopes of the Central Government and the people of the whole country.

<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Chen Jitang's First Army Group originally had the First, Second, and Third Armies, as well as the Independent First and Second Divisions, and another Guard Brigade. After Li Yangjing, Chief of Staff of the Army Group and Commander of the Third Army, resigned as Chief of Staff, 　a rising military figure, Miao Peinan (formerly under Zhang Fakui), succeeded as Chief of Staff of the First Army Group Headquarters. Chen, with 　Miao's assistance, reorganized military affairs and gradually trained new troops. Those established include the Training Division (师), commanded concurrently by Miao Peinan; the Independent Third Division, commanded by Li Hanhun; and the Independent Fourth Division, commanded by Deng Longguang (Li and Deng were also formerly under Zhang Fakui), forming a new faction system. At the same time, the Independent First Division under Huang Renhuan and the Independent First Division under Zhang Ruigui, directly subordinate to the First Army Group Headquarters, were greatly expanded and reorganized into brigades, with two brigades per division, three regiments per brigade, and one company each directly under the Special Operations, Artillery, Engineering, and Machine Gun units, totaling four regiments and sixteen companies. Each of the above two Independent Divisions expanded to two 　people, exceeding almost half the number of soldiers in the divisions under the Second and Third Armies. 　In addition, the Guard Brigade under Chen Hanguang, directly subordinate to the headquarters, and its affiliated units are equal to the Independent Divisions in strength. Although nominally a brigade, its strength is equal to a division. Therefore, the strength of the troops directly trained and completed by Chen Jitang recently includes four Independent Divisions, one Training Division, and one Guard Brigade, with no fewer than 80,000 soldiers. These newly trained troops are all issued new-style military equipment. As for the old faction's First, Second, and Third Armies, the First Army has been sent far away to southern Jiangxi to engage in bandit suppression, assisting Chen in consolidating the border, already becoming a strong army. The Second and Third Armies are stationed in the Eastern River and along the Jiangxi border. Since Li Yangjing has been recuperating in the provincial capital and has long been away from military affairs, Chen Jitang inspected the Seventh and Eighth Divisions of the Third Army during his recent tour of the Eastern River and then transferred the two divisions to Xunwu area along the Jiangxi border to suppress bandits, placing them under the command of Huang Renhuan, the acting commander of the Second Column. Third Army Commander Li Yangjing's military power has been reduced. Zhang Meixin, commander of the Fourth Division of the Second Army stationed in Xinfeng, was suddenly dismissed from his position recently. Problems have also arisen in the Second Army. Xiang Hanping, commander of the Second Army, seeing such circumstances, has again developed the desire to retire. Although Xiang has not left the province, his intention to resign is firm. Chen Jitang then took back the military power of the Second Army and, 　, assumed the position of commander of the Second Army on the 9th of this month, with Xiang personally handing over the command. After Chen Jitang took over the military power of the Second Army, he ordered Zhang Da, the newly appointed commander of the Fourth Division, to reorganize the troops. The Fifth Division of the Second Army, originally stationed in Huizhou, Heyuan, and Xingning, will be ordered to be transferred to Lianping and Heping, placed under the command of the Second Column, and prepared to go to eastern Jiangxi to suppress bandits. At the same time, the 　Independent Fourth Division under Deng Longguang, stationed in the northern part of the river, was transferred to Huizhou to take over defense. Deng received the order 　business 　returned to the province from Chen on the morning of the 9th to ask for instructions. The troops have also been withdrawn to the province in recent days, taking the Guangzhou-Kowloon train to Huizhou. (November 10th)</p>

<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: In recent years, the excessive issuance of paper money in Xuzhou and the prevalence of privately printed paper have flooded the market. Most of them have not made preparations to provide guarantees, and are only secured by private business. The reason why issuers of paper money are not exclusively engaged in the business of money is that their own commercial operations are not running smoothly, and so they issue paper money as a substitute. Until each business 　　one hundred, the market’s paper money increased, copper coins decreased, odd sums, payment no way, then will redemption value of one thousand or five hundred notes, torn in half, each half with the value of half of its value, strange shapes, varied. Although there has been a Financial Consolidation Committee in the area, it has been unable to clean up. Recently, business conditions have been bleak, and all industries are declining. In particular, the Southern Goods industry has been severely sought after by Shanghai debts, with most going bankrupt, and financial conditions are becoming more inflexible. Thus, after many years of being unable to consolidate the paper money, a sudden run has occurred, and has evolved into a shocking wave of people in the financial sector, though unfortunate, is also to be expected. The run began at the Gongyu Bank, which is a financial institution jointly established by the local shops, with Zhang Shaozhi as manager. It usually circulates funds to various businesses, and is more convenient than banks because it is organized by the business community itself. However, as of today, the loans that have been released are unable to be collected, coupled with business losses, it becomes very difficult. The other night, a run suddenly occurred. After the bank was stranded, together with the privately owned Piao Hao Chunyang, Yizhenxiang, Buxinji, Julichang, Shiyuchang, Tianbaoyu and other six companies, a run occurred on the morning of the 11th. In addition to the above seven companies, the paper money normally circulating in the market includes the Ping City Official Money Bureau. After the seven Piao Hao paper monies 　used by society, only Ping City Bureau and Central banknotes were used, and these were used up in a few applications. Thereupon, another wave of runs was caused, causing problems with circulation in the market, and financial chaos. As the county government could not maintain order, the market would not be able to settle down, and a notice was issued on the same day, stating: "For the purpose of the notice, this case has found that the economy has been in recession recently, especially the paper money in this city is rampant, although repeated orders have been issued to ban it, many businesses have not been able to effectively comply, and I am deeply afraid that as time goes by, the disaster will spread, and it is urgent to take immediate action to consolidate, in order to avoid hurting the people, and disrupting social finance.

<p>Various circles in this county oppose the demarcation of the Nanhui-Fengxian border, a long-standing issue that was recently passed by the provincial government meeting. The opposition focuses on a narrow strip of land west of Zhangang Port, east of Qianbu Canal, south of the Huangpu River, and north of Fengxian County, which has been assigned to Fengxian County for administration. The [circles] had previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to instruct the provincial government to reconsider. However, it was learned yesterday that the provincial government's appointed commissioner, 　Tang, is scheduled to come to the county on February 15th to oversee the handover procedures. Therefore, various public organizations have once again sent telegrams requesting a postponement of implementation. An emergency meeting on the border issue was convened by the county government. After discussion, it was resolved that although the case had been decided by the provincial government, it should be complied with. However, all public organizations in this county believe that according to the outline of the regulations for the demarcation of Fengxian and Nanhui, based on historical evolution and considering the customs of the people, there are points that should be submitted to the government for　reconsideration. In addition to the fact that various public organizations have directly submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to reconsider, the association should send a letter to the county government to forward it to the provincial government, and the implementation should be temporarily suspended until the Executive Yuan's approval is received.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Publicizing Telecommunications <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>In today's world, the words "public" and "open" have become fashionable terms. Listing income and expenditure is financial transparency; appointing people based on their abilities is open recruitment. For all other measures, if we can conduct open research based on factual circumstances, credibility will be established, and results will be achieved with half the effort. This can be stated definitively. Telecommunications in our country has a history of over fifty years. From its establishment to its expansion, it has gradually evolved into the phenomenon we see today. Progress has been slow, which is undeniable. However, looking back, we often lament the obstacles that have hindered the advancement of the industry. Telecommunications itself is not to blame. Moreover, past administrations, in their approach to telecommunications reform, revealed only a glimpse, keeping it closely guarded. Even when telecommunications experts conducted research and discussions, they often failed to attract public attention. In fact, the common perception was that telecommunications was a profitable state-run enterprise, requiring no specialized skills to manage effectively, leading to officials engaging in malfeasance to satisfy their personal greed. With the industry lacking transparency and its inner workings concealed, the public viewed telecommunications as a mystery. This publication aims to dispel this mystery.</p>
<p>An industry cannot be divorced from society, and the use of telecommunications is deeply connected to the public. Now that the political situation is gradually becoming clearer and the authorities are striving for development, telecommunications is an important part of that development. In this phase of growth, it is felt that public discussion is valuable to meet society's needs. The staff of this publication is committed to the following goals: We will strive to uncover and report on telecommunications development news so that the public can understand the truth. We will strive to contribute opinions on telecommunications reform so that the authorities know what to adopt. In addition, we will fully publish general telecommunications knowledge, skills, recent developments in overseas telecommunications, and the latest statistics on China's telecommunications, to introduce them to the public. If members of the public have opinions on the use of telecommunications, their publication can assist those working in the telecommunications industry. In short, we aim to make "telecommunications" public, and through the power of society, promote the development of the telecommunications industry. The "Publicizing Telecommunications" initiative is intended for this purpose. Therefore, at the beginning of this publication, we have chosen these four characters as our motto.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Controlled Economy and Telecommunications <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yunzhen</p>
<p>Since the Mukden Incident, the tide of global economic panic has swept across the Pacific, impacting our country, which suffers from insufficient production, underdeveloped industry, and inadequate transportation, the most. Examining our national situation internally and considering the external environment, we realize that unity is essential to resist foreign aggression, and development is necessary to alleviate the people's suffering. First, Wang Jingwei issued a declaration to "seek unity through development," followed by Song Ziwen's plan to "save the country from its economic woes." Consequently, the Economic Commission was reorganized, hoping to strengthen national power through controlled economic methods and break through the internal and external pressures. This is indeed the only nation-saving policy permissible under China's current circumstances.</p>
<p>What is a controlled economy? Chinese scholars are divided on the issue. Mr. Wu Daquan said: "A controlled economy is when a country, under a certain economic doctrine, creates a comprehensive and systematic economic plan for a specific purpose, whether temporarily or permanently, within a certain economic organization, and implements it using the power of the state." Mr. Mu Qichu said: "The cornerstone of a controlled economy lies in the shift from instability to stability, from operation to management, from the unknown to the known. This is the mainstream of economic development and the continuous effort of all economic actors, as well as the path forward for a controlled economy." Mr. Zheng Dubu believes that a controlled economy is when the state, for the purpose of harmonizing national life and developing the national economy, rationally controls the entirety of national economic activity, eliminates contradictions and conflicts in economic behavior. Based on these three views, we can draw a conclusion: A controlled economy is when a country, under a certain economic environment, uses state power to formulate an economic plan for the purpose of stabilizing national life, alleviating economic panic, and harmonizing national production, in order to achieve economic equilibrium in society.</p>
<p>Does China need to implement economic controls? We need not look as far back as Guan Zhong's rule of Qi, Shang Yang's rule of Qin, or Wang Anshi's rule of Song, which are authoritative examples of controlled economies in history. Reading Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China," which aims to develop national production, reveals the fundamental principle of a controlled economy. Furthermore, according to Article 19 of the Domestic Policy Program of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, "Enterprises with monopolistic characteristics that cannot be run by private individuals, such as railways and shipping, shall be managed by the state." The so-called enterprises with monopolistic characteristics refer to transportation and public utilities. Telecommunications is one of the transportation industries, which is significantly related to a nation’s political, military, economic, and cultural affairs. For this reason, our government nationalized the telecommunications industry 25 years ago (the 34th year of the Guangxu reign in the Qing Dynasty), taking it from private hands through sound legislation. However, in the past 25 years, the telecommunications industry has declined and various contradictions and conflicts have been discovered. This is not a fault of the telecommunications system itself, but a failure of control.</p>
<p>Regarding the legal aspects of telecommunications control, there is the Telecommunications Ordinance promulgated by the National Government on August 5, 1929; the Regulations on the Supervision of Private Public Utilities promulgated in December of the same year; and the Provisional Measures for Import Permits for Wireless Radio Materials approved on May 8, 1930. On January 31, 1930, the Executive Yuan issued a circular to all agencies in Beijing and elsewhere to ban privately established radio stations, and on July 7, 1933, approved the Ministry of Communications' principle of entrusting provincial governments to handle long-distance telephone services. Among the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Communications are the Regulations on the Prohibition of Private Submarine Cables Landing, dated December 24, 1930, and the Provisional Regulations on the Prohibition of Private Broadcasting Radio Stations, dated November 24, 1933. A close reading of these regulations reveals the significance of controlled economic measures, strict legislation, and self-respect for sovereignty. However, what is the actual situation?</p>
<p>The landing of submarine cables concerns national sovereignty, and foreigners should not be allowed to set them up privately without the permission of the host country's government. Since 1865 (the fourth year of the Tongzhi reign in the Qing Dynasty), when a Briton named Laying installed a landline from Shanghai to Wusongkou, a gradual encroachment on sovereignty had begun. Later, in 1871 (the tenth year of the Tongzhi reign), the Great Northern Telegraph Company privately installed a submarine cable in Shanghai, connecting it to Xiamen, Hong Kong in the south, and Nagasaki and Vladivostok in the north. Under the condition of letting China use its cables, the Qing court permitted it, giving foreign companies legal acknowledgement to the landing of submarine cables. Then various water cable landing and connection contracts, water cable landing patent contracts, Shanghai-Yan-Gu water cable agency contracts, Gu-Jin-Ping cable borrowing contracts, loan contracts, and reporting fee contracts were signed. The conditions were harsh and extremely restrictive, preventing the development of external communications. Fortunately, various unequal treaties have expired. After two years of negotiations by the Ministry of Communications, a new treaty was signed this April, recovering many rights and interests. However, it would be imprudent to say that sovereignty has been completely restored. This is evidence that international wired telegraphy has failed to implement controlled economic policies.</p>
<p>During the time of the Beijing government, domestic wired telegraph bureaus were controlled by local military men, and the bureau chiefs were their cronies. The central government simply made appointments as usual. With the establishment of the National Government, there was a refreshing change. But due to various reasons, the military separatist situation could not be entirely broken. The chiefs of the telegraph bureaus in Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces were all appointed by local military men. The reporting fee revenues and various forms were often not submitted to the Ministry for review. Because political unification was not achieved, the telecommunications industry lost the opportunity for control.</p>
<p>Although domestic wireless telegraph and telephone services are managed by the Ministry of Communications, the Construction Departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces also operate provincial long-distance telephone services, using telephone telegraphs and competing with the Ministry for short-term profits. Or, under the pretext of military communications, they set up shortwave radio stations and secretly send and receive commercial reports, which is also common. As for foreigners in the concessions or foreign consulates setting up radio stations to transmit news, this is even more disruptive to our national sovereignty. Methods should be devised to ban these practices in order to achieve effective control.</p>
<p>The most advantageous aspect of economic control is the development of transportation. And the easiest way to develop transportation is to reorganize existing industries and plan new initiatives. China's telecommunications industry has a history of 50 years and more than 20,000 specialized personnel. If reorganized and expanded, it would be easier than various other transportation industries. Its function is to hold the communications hub for various transportation industries. We must formulate fundamental telecommunications laws and lay the administrative foundation. Allocate a portion of the cotton and wheat loan to serve as the economic foundation. Then unify the telecommunications organization and train capable personnel. Adhere to the principle of economic control, and use the method of technical cooperation to formulate a ten-year or five-year telecommunications implementation plan. Persevere and be determined to fully implement it. If, after all this, China's telecommunications industry still cannot achieve the effectiveness of economic control, I will not believe it.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Phantom Circuit and Crossover in Telephone Communication ▲ A Simple Explanation <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Guan</p>
<p>I recently read in the newspapers that "For the sake of developing Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone service, four new telephone lines have been erected, and phantom crossovers are being used. This project is already underway and the phantom circuit will be operational</p>
<p>in the new year." The concept of phantom crossover may not be clear to many readers, and the benefits of using phantom circuits for Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone service are probably what readers want to know. Therefore, I will provide a simple explanation within the scope of this publication:</p>
<p>What is a phantom? This must be explained first. If something can be called a phantom, it seems to be virtually nonexistent. If we use the term "phantom," the image or sound seems unreal, which may cause misunderstanding. But in telephone usage, "phantom" is a technical term. Using a phantom circuit (a circuit is the path connecting both sides of a telephone call), if you originally have two pairs of telephone lines, this method can increase the number of usable pairs to three. There is no need to increase the number of lines or the induction of electrical current</p>
<p>, and simultaneous calls can be increased by one. The so-called phantom does not have a dedicated line for your own call, but rather uses the adjacent telephone line pair to connect and form a circuit. Not only is the call genuine, but it is also clearer. It is simply called a "phantom."</p>
<p>To understand the connection of a phantom circuit, you can refer to the diagram below. The two-way call in the middle of the diagram is the "phantom circuit," which is clearly different from the telephone sets at the top and bottom, each occupying a pair of wires.</p>
<p>Whether they are telegraph or telephone wires, if they are strung on the same pole, they can easily cause mutual induction. This induction is what ordinary people call noise. For example, when listening on the telephone, hearing the sound of telegraph transmissions or the voices of people talking nearby is induction. To reduce or eliminate induction, telecommunications uses a type of line crossover. This method involves crossing the wires every few poles, which is called a regular crossover. Alternatively, the phantom circuit mentioned above can be used. Because there are more lines, the crossover method is also different. This article is simply a brief explanation, so I will not elaborate on how to perform the crossover.</p>
<p>Readers can refer to the diagram below. The original wires above, due to the passage of current, cause induced electricity on lines A and B. This induced electricity is different at the top and bottom. Because of the crossover, the positive and negative charges tend to cancel each other out. Therefore, the impact on the two-way call can also be reduced. The reason why the Ministry of Communications of our country handles long-distance telephone service and uses crossovers on the Beijing-Shanghai line is to ensure that the caller can have a clear transmission, as if they were face to face.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Improvement of Telegraph Services in the Past Year (Part 1) Liu Junxiang <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Telegraph is a public utility, and in terms of business, we should strive to commercialize it to facilitate communication for all parties. However, those who handled telecommunications in our country in the past often regarded the telegraph bureau as a state agency, as a means to becoming officials, leading to passivity, languor, and a sluggish atmosphere. As a result, there has been no significant progress in the past forty or fifty years. And the corruption of the content is particularly criticized by society. Recently, the Ministry of Communications, in order to rectify the situation, has been actively seeking the development of telegraph services under the principle of commercialization. It has thoroughly reformed the various abuses that existed in the past. On the one hand, it is adopting the current good practices in Europe and the United States as much as possible. Within the past year, the results of the improvement have been remarkable. Here are some of the major ones, listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Free Translation of Incoming Telegrams According to regulations, the telegraph bureaus used to require senders or recipients to translate telegrams received or sent. If someone requested the telegraph bureau to translate for them, they had to pay a translation fee. However, in fact, few senders and recipients, except for government agencies or large merchants, have code books. If it is a sending telegram, it can be translated by the telegraph bureau. But if it is an incoming telegram, the recipient has to take the telegram to the telegraph bureau after receiving it and ask for translation, which inevitably delays the matter. Furthermore, the scope of telegraph use in our country is very narrow. The general public does not send telegrams unless it is urgent. How anxious must the recipient be when they receive an untranslated telegram? The Ministry of Communications originally had a method for translating incoming telegrams, but over time it was neglected, and many bureaus and stations often disobeyed in secret. Therefore, the previous order has been reiterated, and penalties for missed translations have been stipulated: All incoming telegrams in Chinese, except for telegrams related to political news, disaster relief, and public welfare, and telegrams where the recipient is a merchant in a busy location, will be translated by the telegraph bureau free of charge. If it is found that a translation is missed, the person in charge will be fined one cent per word. At the same time, advertisements will be placed in various newspapers and periodicals to inform the public and prevent the bureaus and stations from deliberately trying to be clever. Afterwards, when recipients receive telegrams, they will immediately know the contents in detail, saving the trouble of translation and eliminating extra expenses. The benefits are indeed significant.</p>
<p>(2) Improving the Attitude of Receiving and Sending Personnel The receiving and sending personnel of each bureau and station have the most contact with the outside world. However, these personnel often have arrogant attitudes, and they often do not ask for details when answering questions. Furthermore, when charging fees, the exchange rates of various subsidiary coins are often arbitrarily changed, which can easily create a bad impression of the bureaus and stations among senders and is a major obstacle to the development of the business. The Ministry of Communications has specially formulated a "Receiving and Sending Personnel On-Duty Guidelines," which specifies in detail the matters that receiving and sending personnel should pay attention to, abide by, and understand while on duty, and distributed it to each bureau and station, so that the responsible personnel can earnestly supervise their compliance. Now, the receiving and sending personnel in various places are generally more polite, and they will answer inquiries to the best of their ability. The original undesirable practices have been eliminated, and senders feel much more convenient.</p>
<p>(3) Establishing Business Inspectors The regulations and procedures for telegrams are quite complicated, and many senders and recipients do not fully understand them. If they are not explained, misunderstandings can easily occur. Furthermore, it is inevitable that there are defects in business and errors in procedures on the telegraph bureau side. However, if there is no opportunity to communicate, one side will feel disappointed, and the other will not have any hope of improvement. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications has specially established business inspectors in each major bureau and station to be responsible for inspecting telegraph business. Every day, they personally go to various sending merchants, government agencies, organizations, newspaper offices, news agencies, etc. to inquire about incoming and outgoing telegrams. Are there any delays or errors? Are the various regulations and procedures clear? Are there any dissatisfactions? And pay attention to whether the bureaus and stations translate private Chinese telegrams? Are there any requests for tips from the couriers? From now on, if senders and recipients do not understand the telegraph business, they will have a place to ask questions. If there are any dissatisfactions, they will be able to get proper answers. Invisibly, a good impression of the telegraph bureaus and stations is fostered. And on the bureau and station side, they can also know where the shortcomings are and use them as a reference for improvement, which is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Progress of French Broadcasting Radio Business Chen Xianding <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>French advanced scholars have made many contributions to the broadcasting radio business in their laboratory work. However, because the French people do not pay much attention to this important invention, the French broadcasting radio business has gradually lagged behind other developed countries. Therefore, the French people are now paying close attention to this business in order to regain their previous advantageous position.</p>
<p>The initial creation of the French broadcasting radio business was the broadcast of the Eiffel Tower military radio station in November 1921. This broadcast initially consisted only of weather reports, but soon included the dissemination of public economic and administrative news. Since then, there have been many important improvements over the past twelve years.</p>
<p>The question of whether the broadcasting of wireless telephones should be of a free or proprietary nature has become a problem. The Finance Act of June 30, 1923, stipulated that "the patent and security measures for telegraph lines stipulated in the order of December 27, 1851, shall apply to the transmission and reception of all radio signals." The order of December 28, 1926, stipulated the rules for state-run and private radio stations. The Finance Act of March 19, 1928, stipulated that the government had the right to temporarily permit private broadcasting radio businesses, limited to those that existed at the end of 1927. However, if there were any changes to the nature or method of operation, a special permit would be required to avoid conflicting with the organizational law of the broadcasting radio business. But even under these chaotic circumstances, private radio stations have made many improvements in organizational aspects, and in terms of funding, they have not received any national subsidies other than relying on their sole source of income, advertising revenue. Officials of the Postal and Telecommunications Department first created a state-run radio communications network, which received a small subsidy from the state in addition to collecting advertising revenue.</p>
<p>Regarding the regulations, each minister has planned and formulated them. During Martin's tenure, a free broadcasting jurisdiction was stipulated (May 28, 1929). Finally, the method of operating the broadcasting business with national financial resources was stipulated.</p>
<p>It is now planned to use 65 million francs to purchase or establish important broadcasting stations in various places as state-run businesses. And the Higher School of Posts and Telecommunications will increase the antenna power to 120KW to facilitate listeners in the countryside around Paris. The stations in Nice, Toulouse, and Lyon are planned to be 60KW. Other stations will also be improved.</p>
<p>The colonial broadcasting city station of Bon Mesa (near Paris), as well as the colonial stations in Algiers, Rabat, and Saigon, have all been opened. In addition, there are several other colonies that will also establish stations in the same way.</p>
<p>The French state-run radio communications network, within the country, includes the Higher School of Posts and Telecommunications, the Eiffel Tower, Lyon, Strasbourg, Grenoble, Marseille, Bordeaux, Montpelier, Rennes, Lille, Toulouse, and Limoges.</p>
<p>As for private stations, two have been approved to increase their power. In addition, Radio Paris of the French Radio Telephone Company has increased its antenna power from 17KW to 60KW, which can be called one of the largest stations in Europe. Poste-Parisien of the Power General Company was originally created by a major newspaper in Paris, and its antenna power has also been set at 60KW, which can compete with the best stations in Europe. Other similar methods have also been decided. There are currently ten private stations allowed to broadcast in France.</p>
<p>The order of December 28, 1926, stipulated that the technical aspects of the state-run broadcasting radio communications network are to be handled by the organs that manage finance and economy. But the arrangement and realization of the programs are entrusted to the following private businesses: such as the Radio Listeners Association (specifically for the Higher School of Posts and Telecommunications) and the General Radio Telephone Association (specifically for the Eiffel Tower). It is heard that the improvement of the organization is already mature, and the progress will inevitably be rapid. In the future, the French broadcasting radio business will have even greater progress.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Significance of Recapturing the Telegraph Sending and Receiving Rights of Submarine Cable Companies He Shui <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Based on equal telegraph contracts signed with the Qing government, the people of the three countries of Great Britain, Denmark, and the United States previously installed submarine cables in China's territorial waters, and separately established the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific three submarine cable companies in Shanghai, directly sending and receiving telegrams to and from Shanghai and various places in the world. Due to the length of their existence and their efforts to promote telegraph business, the names of these three companies are deeply imprinted in the minds of Shanghai residents, and when they have telegrams to send abroad, they must go to these companies to send them.</p>
<p>Because the previously signed unequal telecommunications contracts have expired, after strict negotiations between the Ministry of Communications and these companies, under the current national strength and financial environment, the first step is to recapture the rights of the companies to directly send and receive telegrams to the public. The reception of the three companies' sending and receiving offices will be implemented on May 1 of this year. They will be reorganized into "Sending and Receiving Offices for Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Submarine Cable Telegraphs of the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications." The affairs within the offices, such as the sending and receiving of telegrams, the deployment of staff, and the management of couriers, will all be managed by the directors and deputy directors dispatched by the Ministry of Communications, acting under the orders of the Ministry of Communications and the International Telecommunications Bureau.</p>
<p>The recapture of the right to directly send and receive telegrams by submarine cable companies is of great significance, because from now on, all Chinese and foreign telegrams that are transmitted via the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific submarine cables will pass through our hands, and there will be no omission of a single telegram. Its greatest significance can be listed in the following points:</p>
<p>(A) Maintaining China's telecommunications sovereignty.</p>
<p>China's telecommunications is a state-run business and is managed by the Ministry of Communications. No other organization can overstep its authority. Foreign merchants, with the permission of the Chinese government and in compliance with the regulations promulgated by the Chinese government, are allowed to operate international telegraph communication businesses in China, which is not uncommon in Europe, the United States, and Japan. However, in order to maintain the integrity of China's telecommunications sovereignty, it is difficult to allow companies to directly send and receive telegrams to the outside world for a long time.

<h3 id="e93">Information on Telegraph Inquiries 清hua <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>In this article, the terms "telegraph office" or "telegraph bureau," etc., can represent "radio station" or "radio station." For simplicity, we only use "telegraph office," new readers please note.</p>
<p>Telegrams are a powerful communication tool. Senders must be familiar with all telegraph business procedures in order to fully utilize them and achieve the greatest effectiveness. Because the Chinese people rarely send telegrams, they do not pay much attention to the various business procedures. The telegraph offices also rarely publicize, leaving the public without the opportunity to understand. Recently, the Ministry of Communications published a new edition of the Clear and Cipher Code, which includes detailed business procedures, providing great convenience to the public who have this book. However, the various business procedures published in this new edition of the code are mostly summaries of various telegraph regulations, and information regarding the procedures for inquiring about telegrams, etc., are still lacking. To facilitate the public and maximize the effectiveness of telegrams, we have specially compiled a "Guide to Telegraph Inquiries," which lists in detail the common knowledge that recipients or senders should have when inquiring about telegrams for reference. It is hoped that the telegraph offices will print this as a booklet and distribute it to telegram senders, so they can be familiar with how to use telegrams effectively, which will be beneficial to business development. (1) Guide to Telegraph Inquiries for Recipients</p>
<p>(1) Ambiguity in the Telegram Text: When a recipient receives a telegram, if there is ambiguity in a sentence or word in the text because it is not coherent with the overall meaning, or if they believe a word is incorrect, they can bring the telegram to the telegraph office for inquiry. If the office verifies that there is no error, a paid public telegram can be sent to the sending office to inquire. This paid public telegram is charged according to the number of characters being inquired about. For example, inquiring about one character requires prepayment of the fee for one character. If the inquiry reveals that the character was indeed transmitted incorrectly by the sending office or an intermediate office, the prepaid fee for one character can be refunded in full. However, if the character is correct, or if it was mistaken for another character due to the sender's unclear handwriting, the fee for this character will not be refunded.</p>
<p>(Note) If a recipient suspects ambiguity in the telegram text and inquires directly with the sender without using a paid public telegram, even if the character in question was indeed an error by the telegraph office, the fee for their own telegram and the original telegram fee will not be refunded.</p>
<p>(2) Missing Text in the Telegram: When a recipient receives a telegram and believes that there are missing words or sentences in the text, they can bring the telegram to the telegraph office for inquiry. If the office did not miss any transcription, it must have been a deletion by the sending office or an intermediate office. A paid public telegram can be sent to the sending office to inquire. There are two ways to inquire: (1) If it is believed that one or more characters are missing after a certain character, the request can be made to retransmit one or more characters after that character. (2) If many words or sentences are missing from the entire telegram, or if the meaning of the entire telegram is unclear, a request can be made to retransmit the entire telegram. This paid public telegram is charged according to the number of characters requested for retransmission. For example, requesting the retransmission of two characters requires prepayment of the fee for two characters. Requesting the retransmission of the entire telegram requires prepayment of the fee for all characters. If the inquiry reveals that the telegraph office did indeed miss one or more characters, the prepaid fee can be refunded in full. However, if among the retransmitted characters, only one character was missed by the telegraph office, and the remaining characters are the same as the original telegram, only the fee for one character will be refunded.

<p>Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the China Aviation Association, went to Beijing a few days ago to participate in the naming ceremony of the Huangpu aircraft. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited to inquire about the association's recent work. The following is a record:</p>
<h3 id="e97">Urging the Collection of Donated Funds <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lin said that although the association raised more than one million yuan during the fundraising campaign in the spring of this year, it has not yet been fully collected. The fundraising office has repeatedly urged and hopes to be able to conclude by the end of this year. Eight of the eighteen aircraft purchased by the association have now been named. The Lianglu aircraft is about to be named. The association is currently in contact with various circles in Anhui Province who are purchasing an aircraft. The province was initiated by businessmen. When I was in Beijing, I sent someone to contact them, but we did not reach an agreement. The Pinghan Railway is also purchasing three aircraft, but negotiations have not yet been finalized. When the Huangpu aircraft was named in Beijing, the performance of thirty-six aircraft in formation aroused the interest of personnel from various agencies in Beijing, and many inquired with me. Therefore, there should be a continuous stream of people coming to the association to discuss.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Aviation Society is in Progress <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Aviation Society, according to the discussion of its organizational regulations, the aircraft field, aircraft, and instructors have also been contacted with various parties in the aviation industry and have received support. The reason for the delay in starting the organization is the fundraising. This time, Mr. Sun Tonggang came to Shanghai and was originally scheduled to return north on the evening after participating in the naming ceremony of the Lianglu aircraft. He is scheduled to come to the association today (yesterday) to discuss the Aviation Society. Sun is very concerned and hopes to see its completion as soon as possible, so he has agreed to my request to stay for a few more days to discuss in detail. Sun is also willing to transfer the new aircraft donated by Du Yuesheng to the society for the purpose of cultivating new talents, so the Aviation Society is about to take shape.</p>

<p>Li Dasan, Executive Committee Member of the Lianglu Special Party Department, and Secretary Xie Chengyu, visited Mr. Lin again yesterday afternoon to request assistance in preparing for the naming ceremony and scheduled a meeting with relevant parties in the next few days to discuss everything. The Aviation Association has sent a letter to the Aviation Administration to request the allocation of aircraft and the dispatch of personnel to Shanghai to participate in the naming ceremony of the Lianglu aircraft. A reply was received from Director Xu the other day stating that all matters regarding the allocation of aircraft for the Lianglu naming ceremony should be handled as requested. In addition to ordering the Aviation School to comply, please convey this. It is further learned that the Lianglu Preparatory Committee plans to fly the aircraft to major stations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou after the naming ceremony for display and publicity. The route and landing stations will be determined after the ceremony in consultation with the pilots. The Aviation Association also sent a telegram to the government yesterday to request commendation for the Lianglu aircraft donation. The original telegram stated: Wei, Director of the National Government of Beijing</p>

<p>Riri News Agency reports that recently, various newspapers have been spreading rumors that Hu Hanmin will go to Fujian and that there will be other changes in Fujian's politics. A reporter from Riri News Agency specially visited Mr. Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee in Shanghai, to inquire about the above situation. According to Mr. Li's reply, Tang Jiyu, the younger brother of Tang Jiyao, the former military governor of Yunnan, has come to Shanghai from Hong Kong and visited him. According to him, the Southwest is paying close attention to national affairs, but it is not as serious as reported. Mr. Hu has no intention of going to Fujian. It is probably just a rumor. Tang came here from the Southwest, so his words should be credible. Some people suspect that I will go to Fujian or Jiangxi, but that is not the case either. As far as I know, none of the Central Committee members in Shanghai have gone to Fujian so far.</p>

<p>Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, met with reporters from various newspapers at the Shanghai office of the Economic Council on Xiafei Road at 11:00 yesterday morning to report on the council's recent work and expressed his willingness to devote himself to construction projects and not discuss political issues. The following is a record of Mr. Song's conversation:</p>
<h3 id="e102">Breaking Away from Politics and Devoting to Construction <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Song first said that the government was able to understand his difficulties this time and allowed him to resign from various political positions, so that he could devote himself to construction projects, which made him feel very happy. During his trip abroad, he had many cooperation plans with various countries in construction, and he is now determined to continue to implement them one by one. After selecting a location, the Shanghai office of the Economic Council is currently engaged in internal organization. As for the selection of the director of the Shanghai office, it has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Drafting a One-Year Plan for the Economic Council <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the original road, water conservancy, agricultural field, and other projects of the National Economic Council, it has also been decided to draft a one-year plan for the Economic Council in order to implement it step by step. He has been inviting various parties to discuss the draft of the one-year plan these days. Once it is completed, he will go to Beijing to convene a standing committee meeting of the Economic Council and submit it for discussion. This plan will be announced after it is approved by the standing committee.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Two More Standing Committee Members Will Be Appointed to the Economic Council <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Council has now decided to appoint two more standing committee members. In addition to Minister Kong Xiangxi, another candidate has not yet been decided. The Cotton Industry Control Committee is actively proceeding. As for the Silk, Mining, and Food Industry Control Committees, they will be established after the candidates are decided. However, it is quite difficult to select candidates. First, they must have the trust of society. Second, they must have the courage to do things. Third, they must be able to cooperate with the government. In addition to these three, they must also have the time to devote themselves to service. For example, Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, has requested a leave of absence from the Shanghai Bank for six months so that he can devote himself to the work of the Cotton Industry Control Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Cotton and Wheat Loans are Controlled by the Economic Council <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Council's own expenses are only tens of thousands of yuan per month, but the project expenses are quite large. In the past, most of them were used for water conservancy, road construction, and health experimental fields, which were subsidized by the government. In the future, all project expenses will be controlled by the American cotton and wheat loans. The rumors that the government has suffered losses in American cotton are completely untrue. The government will sell the American cotton after it is shipped and then continue to ship American cotton after it is sold out. American wheat will be shipped from the United States according to domestic needs. The first batch of American wheat is expected to be shipped from the United States to Shanghai around the end of the year or early next year. In short, the government has a detailed plan for selling American wheat and will never suffer any losses.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Steel and Other Factories are Under the Charge of the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>I had contacted the steel and sulfuric acid factories in Germany before, but this matter is handled by the Ministry of Industry, so the Ministry of Industry will be in charge of the future progress. In short, all construction projects will not be shelved due to changes in the political situation. As for the rumors that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Economic Council, it is just speculation and not true.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Qin Fen Still Serves as Secretary-General of the Economic Council <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Qin Fen, the Vice Minister of Finance, will continue to serve as the Secretary-General of the National Economic Council. A few people who followed me in the Ministry of Finance have now been transferred here to work. As for other personnel in the Ministry of Finance, I have advised them not to advance or retreat based on personal gains or losses, but to continue to be responsible and serve the country.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Not in Office, Do Not Talk About Politics <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Finally, when reporters asked Song about various rumors from the Southwest, Song said that he has now left the government position and is devoted to construction work, so he does not want to express anything about any political issues. As the saying goes, "Not in office, do not plan for its administration." After speaking, he shook his head repeatedly, his attitude extremely firm. The reporters then bid farewell and left.</p>
<p>Xunjian, in accordance with the letter from the Preparatory Committee for Air Defense Donations of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the committee has decided to hold the naming ceremony of the aircraft purchased with donations on the 18th of this month, and will donate them to the government. It is proposed to request the government to issue certificates of commendation in accordance with the previous examples of the Shanghai merchants and other numbers, in order to encourage them. For this reason, this telegram is sent to request that it be submitted for approval and that certificates of commendation be issued quickly, in order to show public friendship.

<h3 id="e109">The Air Force Should Be Developed Urgently <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lin also said that when the Huangpu aircraft was named this time, thirty-six aircraft participated in the performance, which was unprecedented in our country. Two-thirds of the pilots were instructors and students from the Aviation School. This opportunity to make a long-distance formation flight and combat performance is the best opportunity for practice, and it also gave the people of the capital great excitement. It is undeniable that our navy has failed, and the army must be reformed in terms of quality, while the air force is very weak. If we want to seek self-defense, we must seek development urgently.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Japanese Daily News stated that the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia has gradually become concrete. At this time of tense relations between Japan and Russia, the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia is a strategy to contain Japan. Even the 15,000 White Russians in Shanghai have been instigated by a certain country. People from a certain country are now trying their best to encourage the White Russians to support the Soviet Union. People from a certain country have now begun to investigate various White Russian organizations residing in this port, ordering them to directly lean towards a certain country and indirectly support Soviet Russia. Recently, financiers from a certain country have planned to establish a White Russian Officers' Club for the Russian Gordeiev. They are willing to donate the capital of 200,000 yuan and the land for the club's construction unconditionally. This is because a certain country is preparing that in case of war, the White Russian organizations will be the most active in the Siberian wilderness and can be used as a rear support. It is heard that the first cadre meeting did not yield results due to disagreements. The second cadre meeting will be held soon to decide on the final attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Overseas Chinese are Rejected Everywhere <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Returned from France France has been strictly cracking down on Chinese entering the country, such as those engaged in industrial work and peddlers, in recent years. The French consulate does not sign entry passports, so ships often smuggle them into the country. If they are discovered, they will be deported. More than ten Chinese workers from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, including Zhu Lianzhai, Zhou Shitong, Chen Xizhai, Shen Wenhe, Jin Fuming, Sun Baocai, Zhou Xinzhi, Fu Juncai, Dong Xiemin, and Huang Ruixing, were all engaged in labor and peddling in France. They have now been returned to their country from Marseille, France, on a Japanese ship because they violated their entry regulations and could not stay in France. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai, the overseas Chinese returned to Wenzhou, Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Expelled from Japan Chinese who go to Japan are prohibited from entering the country by the Japanese police in various ports, and they are detained and then put on Japanese ships and deported to Shanghai. In the past two days, there have been three batches, totaling more than 20 people, including Lou Yinfa, Lin Rixun, Fang Xinchang, Zhang Deen, Lan Mumu, Chen Daoyuan, Ye Xiuming, Xue Zhirong, Ye Donggui, Fang Yiguang, and Wang Liuxing. Most of them are miscellaneous goods merchants and kimono merchants. When these overseas Chinese are returned to Shanghai, if they do not have travel expenses, they will leave their luggage as collateral and order them to redeem it, so everyone arrives in Shanghai in a very embarrassing state.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Resolution of the Refusal to Dye Wave The Two Parties Signed Three Reconciliation Measures The Trade Union Will Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss Resumption of Work <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the workers in the silk and cloth dyeing industry in this city were indignant because the capital side did not fulfill the contract for the price list of wine money signed by the Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Bureau before the 16th year of the Republic of China, which caused a dispute over the refusal to dye goods in 72 dyeing workshops throughout the city. Yesterday, the Social Bureau convened a mediation and signed three reconciliation measures, announcing the resolution. The labor side is scheduled to hold a meeting today to discuss the resumption of work. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation and Resolution The Social Bureau, considering that the dispute in the dyeing industry has been delayed and unresolved, and both parties have suffered infinite losses, specially convened a mediation again yesterday in conjunction with the Municipal Party Department. Wei Yi and Hu Taiqing from the labor side, Pan Zhongming and Fan Ruihua from the capital side, and Lu Yinchu from the Municipal Party Department attended. Zhu Jintao presided over the meeting and Wang Zhiqin took the minutes. First, the two parties stated their opinions. After a long period of negotiation, the opinions of the two parties gradually approached, and they expressed mutual supervision and implementation, and decided on three reconciliation measures as follows: (1) The wine money for silk and cloth dyeing workshops should be strictly implemented by the capital side in accordance with the price list of wine money signed by the Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Bureau before the 16th year of the Republic of China. (2) The above wine money will be collected by the trade union from the workshops between the 5th and 9th of each month and paid to the employees of each workshop in full immediately. (3) All silk and cloth city employees in the city should resume normal work before the 20th of this month. Both parties expressed their agreement and signed the minutes, announcing that the mediation was successful.</p>
<p>Labor Side Holds a Meeting The Municipal Dyeing Industry Trade Union believes that the silk dispute has been resolved by the Social Bureau, and all goods should resume work and be dyed as usual. Therefore, it has scheduled a meeting today to announce the mediation process and determine the date of resumption of work, and will then notify all silk workers to resume normal work.</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that today (the 15th) is the 44th anniversary of Brazil's declaration of the Republic. Brazilians in Shanghai and around the world are celebrating. According to the Brazilian government's order last year, September 7 is National Day, because on that day in 1882, the Prince Regent declared Brazil's independence and called himself Emperor Pedro. On November 15, 1889, Brazil declared the Republic, but considering the value and relationship of independence, it was considered more important than declaring the Republic, so September 7 was used to replace November 15 as National Day. However, there are still celebrations as usual today, so the Brazilian Consul General in Shanghai and Brazilian Consular Judge in China, Amitada, held a meeting at the new consulate at 359 Gaun Road in the French Concession to host the residents of Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Great American Evening News reports that American Consul General Cunningham in Shanghai has been in office for 35 years and has been the leader of the Consular Corps for 7 years. After the Consular Corps held a standing committee meeting yesterday, Dutch Consul General Groman presented a silver shield to Mr. Cunningham on behalf of his colleagues to show their admiration. Mr. Groman also gave a short speech praising Mr. Cunningham's achievements for his country and his contributions to increasing the happiness of Shanghai. Mr. Cunningham thanked him as usual. Representatives from the consulates of 20 countries were present at the time.</p>

<h3 id="e118">The Banking Association Invited Dai Ailu to Speak on the National Crisis Views of Japan and China Japan is Tensely Working Hard to Prepare China is a Country Invaded But is As Calm as Usual <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Banking Association invited Dai Ailu, manager of the Osaka branch of the Bank of China, to give a lecture at the auditorium of the YMCA on Sichuan Road at 7:00 the day before yesterday. More than 300 members from various banks attended. Wang Zhixin, manager of Xinhua Bank, presided over the meeting and introduced Dai to the stage to report on his feelings after spending half a year in Japan and recently observing the situation in the three northeastern provinces and North China. His words were extremely insightful. The following is a record of his main ideas:</p>
<p>Atmosphere of National Crisis Mr. Dai first said that he spent six months in Osaka. This time, when he returned to China, he passed through the Northeast, Pingjin, Qinglu, etc., for two months. The deepest feeling he had was that he saw the atmosphere of national crisis in Japan every day. The whole country of Japan, from top to bottom, is preparing for 1936. They are constantly shouting and working hard to overcome the national crisis. When he returned to the country, he felt that the Chinese people were indifferent and forgot about it, and there was no atmosphere of national crisis at all. The Pingjin area was bustling with activity, eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, just like usual. Japan is an aggressor country, and the government and people are working very hard. China is a country invaded, but it is as calm as usual. This is the most heartbreaking thing.</p>
<p>Young Military Officers The young military officer faction is very powerful on the Japanese political stage. The current Army Minister Araki is the leader of the young military officer faction. The reason for the formation of the young military officer faction is the reform of the conscription law. In the past, the conscription system required all citizens to serve in the military for two years. Now, workers and farmers still serve in the military for two years. Middle school students enter the Youth Training Corps while in school and receive strict military training, the same as regular soldiers. After entering university, they do not receive military training, but after graduation, they work as volunteer soldiers for one year. These university graduates have received long-term training in middle and primary schools, so they no longer serve as soldiers. At a minimum, they are awarded the rank of lieutenant. The best of the volunteer soldiers are selected and sent to the Army University for further study. Therefore, the students of the Army University are all outstanding university graduates who are not only good at military affairs, but also have rich knowledge of politics, economics, and society. Therefore, the minds of today's soldiers are no longer as simple as those of the old soldiers in the past. However, at a time when the economic organization of Japanese capitalism has reached its completion and consolidation, these soldiers have no place to use their force to develop their power, so they pretended to take leave and occupied the Northeast on September 18. Today, the young military officer faction is working hard to build a new force based on Manchuria. In terms of economic organization, they have completely abandoned the existing system in Japan and adhere to the unified control. The future results are unknown, but the Chinese people cannot fail to understand its causes and trends.</p>
<p>Controlled Economy When in Japan, there are emergency calls, speeches, broadcasts, and newspaper articles advocating emergency preparedness, such as finance, diplomacy, national defense, etc., almost every day. In addition to advocating, they are also actually proceeding every day. Although some Chinese newspapers also have articles on the crisis of 1936, there is nothing else besides this. For example, there are also people in our country who discuss the controlled economy, but it is only discussed and there is absolutely no possibility of implementation. In Japan, the government's control over enterprises, such as managing foreign exchange and limiting the establishment of bank branches, is implemented one by one. Mitsui Bank and others also deeply feel the government's oppression. Recently, due to the impending war between Japan and the United States and Japan and Russia, they have entered the wartime management period.</p>
<p>External and Internal When it comes to Japan's finances, it is also the same as robbing Peter to pay Paul. Its difficulties may be even worse than ours, but what is very different from us is that our military and politicians often use foreign issues to engage in internal disputes, while in other countries, foreign affairs are critical, which is precisely to coordinate internally and eliminate private opinions. This is the most heartbreaking and uncontrollable thing for us. Next, he stated that the psychology of fear and contempt should not be kept, etc.</p>

Returning to His Home Province to Visit Relatives and Friends, He Has No Official Duties <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xiang, the former acting commander of Songhu, has been traveling to various places in Suzhou and Wuxi since relinquishing his duties. Shortly after, he returned to his residence in Shanghai. Recently, due to telegrams from relatives and friends in Fuzhou, he took the Hua'an merchant ship to Fujian at 11:00 AM yesterday. He was accompanied only by Xie Yun'gao, the former Chief Secretary of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and one attendant. A reporter from the Min Yan News Agency met with Mr. Zhang on the ship yesterday. According to Zhang, the 11th Army was ordered to enter Fujian in November of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), and he happened to be assisting in military affairs, residing in his hometown for several months. Later, when the army left Fujian, he also followed the army, traveling north and south, being separated from his garden home for six years. Recently, he was fortunate to be relieved of his heavy responsibilities and found himself in a state of leisure. His relatives and friends sent him telegrams and letters inviting him, which he could not refuse. Therefore, he took the Hua'an merchant ship back to his hometown. This trip is purely to visit relatives and friends and has absolutely no official duties. Rumors that he will be appointed as the Chief of the Public Security Bureau of the Fujian provincial capital or other positions are mere speculations and far from the truth. As for Commander Dai's hasty departure from Shanghai to Xiamen, he recently received a telegram stating that he has already left Xiamen for Fujian, but he has no knowledge of when he will take office as the Civil Affairs Commissioner of Fujian.</p>

<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter yesterday from Qi Zhanjiu, Commander-in-Chief of the Liaoning National Salvation Army, stating: "Respectfully, in my previous letter, I briefly outlined the situation, hoping for your careful consideration. This time, my entry into Guanzhong has the greatest mission, not only to seek concrete measures from the factory department, but also to find a way out for the entire volunteer army. Since arriving here, after observing the situation in various aspects, it seems that the call for recovering the Northeast is quite dull throughout the country, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the past has gradually dissipated. The environment controls people, how can I not be angry? Looking back at the Northeastern Volunteer Army, since the September 18th Incident, under the iron hooves of the Japanese puppets, fighting in the icy and snowy wilderness, not for personal rights, but because the Northeast is our gateway, if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold, and the danger of national destruction is imminent. Therefore, I would rather sacrifice everything to seek survival for the entire nation. However, due to a lack of material resources, the long-cherished wish of recovering the lost territory has not been fulfilled immediately. I am truly ashamed to face the people of the country. Now that the situation between Japan and Russia is becoming increasingly tense, the people of the Northeast believe that the time to recover their homeland is approaching maturity. It is urgent to unite people within the country, pool wisdom and efforts, and jointly devise fundamental strategies to resist foreign aggression and save the thirty million people who are in deep water and fire. Your association's enthusiasm is admired both at home and abroad. At this critical time, I hope that you gentlemen will uphold the spirit of saving the country as in the past, lead the masses, generously donate, actively assist the Northeastern Volunteer Army, overthrow the Japanese puppet organization, and restore the mountains and rivers of the past. As a soldier, I have an unshirkable duty to defend the country. I vow to follow your association and the people of the country, to exert my meager efforts, and dare to follow the example of the predecessors. If the public's will becomes a fortress and perseveres to the end, so that the submerged rivers and mountains return to China, then the cause of suppressing chaos and reviving the country will all be thanks to you," and so on.</p>

<p>The China National Goods Production and Sales Joint Company is a new organization planned and created in the midst of national crisis to create production and enrich national strength. Therefore, since its inception, military and political leaders from various provinces and enthusiastic people in the industrial and commercial sectors have all risen up to support it. It is now heard that the National Federation of Commerce also believes that the company's joint industrial and commercial sectors to implement production and sales cooperation is of great importance to the future of national goods production. It sent letters to current members of the National Federation of Commerce at home and abroad the other day, asking for support. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Dear Sirs, Recently, we received a letter from the Preparatory Office of the China National Goods Production and Sales Joint Company, which stated that since the preparation, we have received the support of national government military and political leaders, enthusiastic leaders from various provinces, and people from the financial and industrial sectors, all based on the spirit of government-people cooperation, and they all support the unity of the court and the public to save the country. The reputation has been established, and successive participants have followed like clouds. This is because production self-defense is not only an important plan for saving the country today, but also an inevitable way to cope with future world wars. Then, according to the prescribed procedures, the establishment of branch companies in various places is bound to be not far away. Your association is the general government of the National Chamber of Commerce. We urge you to send letters to the current members of the Chamber of Commerce in various places. In addition to asking them to sign as initiators, we also ask them to solicit more enthusiastic comrades to participate together, regardless of the number of shares, in order to establish the first voice of communication, so that there will be something to rely on for trade, and economic and people's livelihood will benefit from it. Gather the strength of the court and the public to plan for saving the country and resisting foreign aggression, so that ten years of education will have something to entrust to. There will be a time to endure humiliation and take revenge. After reading it, the emotion increased. Now that the government has organized a National Economic Committee to plan the control of various industries, the people should rise up to help together. Production and sales cooperation is especially not to be delayed. You, sir, have been leading the merchants for a long time and have been admired for your patriotism and love for the people. We hope to exert the strength of one word and nine tripods and gather the voice of ten thousand mountains echoing, to work for the country and plant benefits for the people. We will certainly be happy to support it. Now we transfer the declaration plan and the letter of undertaking, each one. In addition to filling it out and sending it first, we also ask you to widely solicit comrades and give us advice at any time. Looking at the clouds and mountains from afar, we cannot express all our desires."</p>
<h3 id="e125">Wu Huanru Talks About Organizing Food Production and Sales Institutions <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang believes that regulating food is of great importance to people's livelihood. Therefore, last month, he convened representatives from eight provinces and cities at the Nanchang Headquarters to hold a food conference. The municipal government sent Wu Huanru, the second section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gu Xin'yi, the chairman of the Food Industry Association, to participate. The results of the conference were very good. The most important things were the organization of food production and sales institutions and the establishment of food storage facilities. After Wu and Gu returned to Shanghai, they actively planned and proceeded to implement them as soon as possible. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Wu Huanru yesterday morning. According to him, the recent progress is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Production and Sales Institutions Will Be Realized Soon <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to Wu, the importance of regulating food has been recognized by the people of the country. The current sharp drop in the price of domestic rice is the biggest cause of the bankruptcy of the agricultural economy. Although this city is the main market for selling rice, the inconvenience of inland rice transportation makes it difficult to collect large quantities of rice at one time. Therefore, general merchants often buy foreign rice. At the food conference convened by Chairman Chiang at the Nanchang Headquarters, the representative of this city proposed a plan to organize rice production and sales institutions, intending to ask Chairman Chiang to consult with the government to designate a bank to overdraw 1 million yuan in cash, and then raise 1 million yuan in cash from political and business circles to buy rice in Hunan, Jiangxi and other places. On the one hand, the price of inland rice is raised to save the decline of the rural economy, and on the other hand, foreign rice is resisted, so as to block the loopholes. However, the collection of inland rice to urban areas can be sold in part in this city, and can also be transported to Guangzhou, Tianjin and other places. Guangzhou and Tianjin import a large amount of foreign rice every year. If there is domestic rice to supply, then foreign rice can reduce imports, and the government can implement a full collection of foreign rice tax. The price of domestic rice is cheaper, and sales can be increased. However, the production and sales institutions will be handled by merchants, and the government will supervise them and maintain their permanence. The outline of the plan can be approved by Chairman Chiang to the representatives soon, and the representatives have already had considerable contact in Jiangxi, so the implementation period will not be far away.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Grain Storage Measures Have Not Yet Been Determined <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Wu also talked about the warehouse problem, saying that this city had discussed this matter before, but it could not be realized due to limited funds. Recently, the central government has issued an order to all provinces and cities to store rice, for three reasons: (1) to regulate rice prices; (2) to prevent disaster years; (3) to deal with international changes. The method is that the county stores 10,000 stone, and the township stores 5,000 stone. As far as this city is concerned, the population is large, and the monthly demand for rice is about 100,000 stone, while the funds under the city's warehouses are only more than 200,000 yuan of real estate, and it is jointly owned with Jiangsu Province, so the number is not enough. Now, this city advocates preparing cash, because if there is cash, it is not difficult to buy rice in this city, and the land price in this city is expensive. If warehouses are established, a large amount of stacking land is required, and the cost of purchasing land is required in advance, which feels too uneconomical. Others advocate still following the central government's method to store rice, so this matter still needs to be discussed before a decision can be made.</p>

<p>Chen Jiliang, Political Vice Minister of the Navy and Chairman of the Review Committee, was originally scheduled to review the Tongji and Shun Sheng ships yesterday. However, due to changes in the program, he reviewed the Navy's Aircraft Manufacturing Department and the Jiangnan Shipyard in the morning, and the Navy Hospital and the Seamen's Training Institute in the afternoon.

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the situation between Japan and Russia has become increasingly tense recently, which is of great importance to our country's interests. The International Issues Research Association held a membership lecture at the Bank Club at 5:00 PM yesterday, and invited Chen Binhe, a member of the association, to lecture on "The Russo-Japanese Problem." The lecture was very long, and its outline was divided into ten items: (1) Diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union after September 18; (2) Japan's anti-Soviet remarks; (3) The necessity of the Russo-Japanese War; (4) The relationship between the Soviet Union and Manchuria; (5) Japan's preparations in Manchuria; (6) The Soviet leaders' remarks on national defense; (7) The Soviet Union's preparations in the Far East border; (8) A comparison of the national strength of Japan and the Soviet Union; (9) The Soviet army's combat plan in the eyes of the Japanese; (10) The Japanese prediction of the victory or defeat of the two countries in the eyes of the Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Ministry of Communications Instructs Shipping Crew Members to Apply for Examination Within the Time Limit. Those Who Have Not Passed the Examination Are Not Allowed to Serve on Ships <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that the safety of passengers depends on the ocean navigation of ships, and the experience and knowledge of crew members are particularly important. Therefore, it held an examination in Beijing on the 24th of last month. However, due to business relations, there are still many people who have not been able to take the examination. Therefore, this special instruction is issued to various shipping companies and institutions: those who have not passed the examination are not allowed to serve on ships. The instructions are recorded as follows: "According to Article 16 of the Provisional Regulations on Crew Member Examination, 'Foreigners who are currently serving as officers of Chinese ships, regardless of whether they have obtained a merchant ship officer's certificate, shall, within six months from the date of implementation of these regulations, apply for examination and obtain a certificate in accordance with Article 1 of these regulations and the Provisional Regulations on Crew Member Certificates before they can serve.' Article 1 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Crew Member Examination stipulates that 'All Chinese crew members currently serving on Chinese ships who have not obtained a merchant ship officer's certificate shall apply for examination within six months from the date of implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Crew Member Examination.' The regulations have been in effect since June 1st of this year, and more than five months have passed. The deadline for examination is approaching soon. All Chinese crew members currently serving on Chinese ships who have not obtained a certificate, and foreign crew members who have obtained or have not obtained a certificate, are all required to come to the Ministry before December 1st to apply for examination in order to comply with the laws. In addition to separate orders, the association is hereby ordered to forward this order to all crew members to comply with it. This order."</p>
<h3 id="e131">Reactions to the Increased Rent for Warehouses of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has changed its rental method, shortened the term, and increased the rent due to the difficulty of clearing up the stockpiled goods in the warehouse. It is now heard that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has received a letter from the Bengbu Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, asking for efforts to cancel the increase and maintain the old rules. The original telegram to the Ministry of Railways is as follows: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Railways, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is now revising the new rules for goods arriving at the Shanghai station. The rental period, which used to be seven days, is now changed to five days. The warehouse rent, which used to be 1.5 cents per ton, is now 5 cents, a sudden increase of almost three times, and the time limit is also shortened. This is a major blow to merchants. The intention of the Railway Administration is to restrict the accumulation of goods in the warehouse by raising the warehouse rent, and to promote rapid sales to avoid stagnation. This is only a one-sided idea of the Railway Administration, and it fails to take into account the difficulties of merchants. The goods of the merchants arriving in Shanghai must be sold wholesale. The more quickly they want to sell, the more difficult it is to get a good price. If the warehouse rent is too high, there is no room for waiting for a better price. A slight mistake will result in a loss. This will make miscellaneous grain merchants hesitate or even change to Changshu to save costs. This is not only inconvenient for merchants, but also will greatly affect the revenue of the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Shanghai Railways. This kind of change by the Shanghai Railway Administration is like seeking fish in a dried-up well, and it will backfire. If you want to fundamentally solve the problem, you can only expand the warehouse to provide relief. How can you compare it to the rent of houses in the market and speculate on price increases? The merchants are concerned about their own interests, so they dare to appeal to you. Please, your Ministry, review and verify, and quickly order the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration to immediately cancel the new rules and continue to use the old system to emphasize railway policy and care for the difficulties of merchants. We are extremely anxious to await orders." (The following is omitted)</p>

<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Dachung Shipping Company at 282 Wai Ma Lu in Nanshi purchased the new Ning ship, renamed it the Da Fu ship, and prepared to operate the Shanghai-Yangzhou route. The manager, Wang Zhenxiang, hired 31 people, including Yang Tingsheng, the head of the watermen, and Zhang Xiang'an, the old helmsman, on June 21st of this year, with a monthly salary of 864 yuan. The ship was moored on the Huangpu River near the Longhua Airport. All the crew members stopped eating and jointly demanded payment from the manager, Wang Zhenxiang, because the sailing date was uncertain and the wages were delayed. They received a check for 300 yuan on October 13th and a check for 600 yuan on October 20th. When the due date arrived, the manager avoided meeting them, and the checks were returned by the bank. They went to demand payment again the other day, and were reported and detained by the Avenue Joffre Police Station. Fortunately, they were released on the spot after being questioned by the police chief. All the crew members reported to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department for assistance. In addition to sending staff to investigate, the Social Affairs Bureau strictly ordered the manager, Wang Zhenxiang, to arrive at the bureau on time at 9:00 AM yesterday for questioning. When the time arrived, the manager of the company refused to attend, only sending a representative, so mediation was impossible. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a formal mediation according to law at 9:00 AM on the 18th.</p>

<p>This year's Yellow River flood has hit Hebei, Shandong, and Henan the hardest. In addition to providing emergency relief, the government has allocated funds to set up a Yellow River Disaster Relief Association to handle relief grain and clothing. Relief grain is purchased locally according to the principle of purchasing from neighboring harvest areas in the disaster area. Relief clothing is made in Shanghai, with 100,000 sets of cotton clothes distributed to disaster victims to keep them warm. The cotton clothes, along with 500 sets donated by Mrs. Tang Muchao of Beiping and 1,000 sets donated by Director Zeng Rongpu of the association, were all shipped to the disaster area on the 14th of this month. It is heard that Ms. Fang, the wife of Xi Dejiong, of the disaster relief group of the association, also specially donated 100 sets of new cotton clothes. Ms. Lu, the wife of Gao Dajing, the director of the transportation group, raised 200 sets from relatives and friends, which were also shipped to the disaster area together. However, the disaster area is vast and the number of disaster victims is large. Now it is winter, and the cold wind is piercing. But if you can get one more set of cotton clothes, you can save one more life. The association hopes that compatriots across the country will embrace the heart of compassion and generously donate to save the disaster victims.</p>
<p>In addition, the association has repeatedly received reports from the three provinces on the use of allocated funds. The approximate amounts are excerpted as follows: (Shandong) 8,000 yuan each for Shou Zhang, Yanggu, Dongping, Fanxian, Puxian, and Heze; 7,000 yuan for Juye; 5,000 yuan for Dong'e; 4,000 yuan each for Shanxian, Juancheng, and Jiaxiang; 3,000 yuan for Jining; 2,000 yuan for Wenshang; 1,000 yuan each for Jinxiang and Yutai, totaling 79,000 yuan.

<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Yellow River Emergency Relief Association received a letter yesterday from more than 20 representatives of Linzhang County, Henan, including Du Xian, stating the disaster situation in the county and requesting equal treatment, without discrimination, and providing relief. The letter stated, "To Chairman Xu of the United Association of Shanghai Charity Organizations for Yellow River Emergency Relief, we have learned that the Zhang River in Linzhang County was first seen in the Shangshu Yugong, named Hengzhang. The so-called Heng means horizontal, implying the meaning of collapse and horizontal flow. The Zhang River has been prone to flooding since ancient times. Moreover, the river channel is wide and the water is fierce, often causing sudden and violent floods, sometimes reaching tens of miles wide. Anyang and Neihuang counties in Henan, as well as Daming County in Hebei, have all been affected, but Linzhang is the first to bear the brunt, and the damage is particularly severe. Among the rivers in Henan, besides the Yellow River, the Zhang River in Linzhang is the most severe. Therefore, there is a saying that it is a small Yellow River. Since June of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), the Zhang River has flooded 20 times, with breaches in several places, submerging more than 100 villages. Chairman Liu of the Henan Provincial Government appealed to neighboring provinces, describing the Zhang River as the first to mention in the Henan flood. Its turbulent waves, floods, submergence of wheat, collapse of the bank, collapse of houses, drowning of the population, and the drifting of all livestock and items are all tragic scenes that are heartbreaking to see and talk about in Shanghai. The disaster victims have no place to live or eat, and they are displaced. The damage is equal to that of the Yellow River. Your Excellency is a dragon gate of this generation, with great achievements and high reputation. We are all human beings, and we care about hunger and drowning. We implore you to treat everyone equally, without discrimination, and in addition to raising funds for the Yellow River emergency relief, also raise funds for the Zhang River emergency relief. May your kindness be extended and your merits accumulate and grow. We also ask you to quickly allocate relief funds to extend the lives of the hundreds of thousands of hungry disaster victims and to reverse the disaster. The more than 100 riverside villages of the disaster victims in Linzhang, Henan, represented by Du Xian and more than 20 others, send a true telegram."</p>

<h3 id="e141">Recent News from the Pudong Zhanghua Woolen Mill; Discarding Steam Engine; Switching to Electric Power Operation <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Zhanghua Woolen Mill in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, is a large-scale factory that weaves various wool flannels and gabardines at reasonable prices and high quality. Therefore, Chinese people are eagerly buying and using these products, resulting in excellent sales. The factory originally had a 240-horsepower steam engine for power needs. However, due to its small capacity and excessive coal consumption, it has been discarded. Instead, ten electric motors have been purchased, totaling 254 horsepower, for operation. The China United Engineering Company was commissioned to install them, and the Pudong Electric Company installed power lines, including a 400 kVA transformer. Power supply was connected on the 11th of this month. It is said that the electricity price is quite low, which can save a lot of expenses every month. Furthermore, the Pudong Electric Company has an ample supply of electricity, allowing for easy expansion and supply. In the future, the factory's products will be more exquisite due to the uniform speed of the electric motors. The selling price will gradually decrease as the cost decreases. This is truly good news for the national goods industry.</p>

<p>The Railway Administration issued an order to the Traffic Department stating, "According to the General Affairs Department's report from the Sanitation Section, 'Many open spaces along the railway lines have not been properly maintained, resulting in barren and dirty areas that detract from the scenery. Recently, Engineer Feng Qili planted flowers and trees and installed stone benches in the wasteland west of the Mai Gen Road flag station, creating a new small garden that has greatly improved the visual appeal. Railway stations in various European and American countries utilize nearby open spaces to create gardens, which not only beautifies the environment but also greatly benefits hygiene. This is a good practice to emulate. Therefore, it is proposed to request the Director to instruct the Traffic Department to inform all stationmasters along the railway lines to pay close attention to this matter in the future and be responsible for organizing the open spaces near the stations, creating small gardens based on the terrain. All necessary flowers, grass, and saplings will be supplied by the Jiaxing Nursery. The Bureau will send personnel to inspect the stationmasters' performance in this work at any time, assessing their quality and providing rewards or penalties to promote this initiative.' The investigation is accurate and should be approved. In addition to instructing the General Affairs Department's Property Section to take note, this order is hereby issued to instruct the Traffic Department to inform all stationmasters along the railway lines to comply and coordinate with the General Affairs Department's Property Section for implementation. This order."</p>

<p>Awakens to Find Rickshaw Gone Without a Trace</p>
<p>Tongxing Money Shop at No. 33 Zhifu Road, Public Concession, ordered two apprentices, surnamed Zhang, yesterday at around 12 noon to take 22,000 yuan in cash to the Industrial Bank of China on Beijing Road to deposit. The two apprentices divided the money and put some in their pockets, while holding the rest in their hands (wrapped in newspapers). They hired two rickshaws and went directly to the Industrial Bank of China on Beijing Road. In a hurry, one of the apprentices forgot 5,000 yuan in cash on the rickshaw. When they realized this while making the deposit, the two apprentices ran out together to chase after the rickshaws. However, the rickshaw was nowhere to be found. The two returned to the money shop and reported the incident to the Central Police Station, requesting an investigation. The police are currently investigating the matter.</p>
<p>whether there is any benefit in everything they do, and the other is that one must ask whether there is any direct and immediate effect for everything. However, the Asiatic Society and this museum are a refreshing antidote to this kind of utilitarian thinking. This society seeks knowledge for the sake of knowledge. As for the scholars and teachers in society, they benefit greatly from the facilities of this society, but this can only be regarded as a byproduct. This byproduct, however, should not be ignored. The establishment of this society will have a great impact on the improvement and progress of Shanghai and the country as a whole."</p>

<p>There is a dance hall called the Paris Dance Hall in the French Concession, which is run by Westerners. Among the dancers employed there, one is Gao Lili, from Zhenjiang, 19 years old, and the other is Yin Qiulian, from Liaoning, 21 years old. Although the two women are in the same class, they have different interests and often clash. Now they are involved in a lawsuit in the First Special District District Court. Yin accuses Gao of assault on the afternoon of October 23, requesting a trial based on Articles 293 and 316 of the Criminal Code and attaching a private prosecution, demanding that the defendant be ordered to compensate for damages of 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the court to hear the case. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff, Yin Qiulian, who could speak with a northern accent, deliberately remained silent, claiming that she only knew English and Japanese. The court then ordered an interpreter to translate her English testimony into Chinese. However, the dancer's slavish nature became apparent when she actually claimed to be a "Zhouzhou national" when providing her place of origin. The defendant's defense lawyer, Chao Kun, was shocked to hear this and immediately stated to the court that "Manchukuo nationals" certainly cannot be given legal protection. The defendant, Gao Lili, then defended against the accusations, stating that she had never beaten the plaintiff. Judge Liu finished the hearing and adjourned the court to announce the verdict on the afternoon of the 18th of this month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Charity Groups Joint Association for Raising Funds for the Yellow River Flood Relief sent a letter to this newspaper, which reads: "We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Haikjingbo, Dr. Brandt, the German Consul-General, the German Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Vogel, the representative of the German Community Association, Mr. Bulson, the representative of the German Chamber of Commerce, Rev. Ke Lvge of the German Church, and the Buddhist monk Zhao Kong. The performance by the equestrian troupe to raise funds for the victims of the six provinces was made possible by the enthusiastic cooperation of these gentlemen. Several weeks ago, Guan Jiongzhi and Zhao Puzhu, representing the Relief Association of the Buddhist Jingye Society, visited Master Zhao Kong and earnestly requested him to find a way to ask the Haikjingbo equestrian troupe to perform for the flood victims of the Yellow River. Master Zhao Kong then received the cooperation of Rev. Ke Lvge and the enthusiastic assistance of the German Consul-General, Mr. Vogel, and Mr. Bulson. When Mr. Haikjingbo heard of this request, he immediately agreed without hesitation and volunteered to perform a special program on the day of the performance. Yesterday, Guan Jiongzhi and Huang Hanzhi, representing the Relief Association, along with Rev. Ke, met with Mr. Sai Huade, the manager of the Haikjingbo Circus, and agreed to perform a new program on the 21st of this month, which is Tuesday. We are deeply grateful for the enthusiasm of the German community in Shanghai and Mr. Haikjingbo for the Chinese disaster victims. We are now publishing this letter in the newspaper to commend their benevolence and express our gratitude. The date and program of this equestrian troupe's fundraising performance will be advertised in Chinese and Western newspapers. Please pay attention! Respectfully, the Shanghai Charity Groups Joint Association for Raising Funds for the Yellow River Flood Relief, commissioned by Chairman Xu Shiying and Vice Chairmen Wang Zhen and Wang Xiaolai, November 15."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Haikjingbo Circus Discovers Counterfeit Tickets; A Conspiracy Between Two Ticket Sellers and a Postal Worker; Approached a Printing Shop to Imitate Tickets Daily; Profited Hundreds of Gold Each Over Several Days <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Haikjingbo Circus recently came to Shanghai from overseas and established a circus arena at the original site of the Dahua Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Since its opening, it has been a sensation in China, with unprecedented business success. Li Zhongyun, a Ningbo native, and Wang Guangrong, a Zhenjiang native, were hired as ticket sellers when the circus opened. Li worked the day shift, and Wang worked the night shift. They have been serving diligently for more than a month. However, in the past week, Li and Wang suddenly had bad intentions. Seeing the circus's</p>
<h3 id="e152">Thriving Business, <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>they had a strange idea and wanted to profit from it. They discussed the matter with Ren Linxiang, a Ningbo native who worked as a postal worker No. 618 at the Post Office, and decided to jointly forge admission tickets, divided into one-yuan and two-yuan tickets. Their plan was quite meticulous. First, Ren contacted Li Liu, the owner of the Fuxing Printing Shop at No. 1303, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, and Yao Jiqing, a printing apprentice, and arranged for them to print more than a hundred counterfeit tickets every day, paying a commission of 18 yuan, with Li Liu receiving 15 yuan and Yao receiving 3 yuan. Since the circus tickets changed daily and had different colors, Ren was asked to go to a Western trading company on Nanjing Road the next afternoon to buy one of each, a two-yuan and a one-yuan ticket, and take them to the Fuxing Printing Shop to print imitations overnight. The next morning, Ren would take the printed counterfeit tickets to the circus and hand them over to Li and Wang.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Sold in Secret <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>This plan was put into effect on the 8th of this month. However, because the counterfeit tickets printed were of poor quality, they did not dare to sell them rashly. It was not until the 10th of this month that they reprinted them and began to sell them in secret. This has been going on for five days, and the profits have been substantial. Every day, after deducting the printing fee of 18 yuan from the proceeds of the counterfeit tickets, the remainder was divided equally among Li, Wang, and Ren. Each person could earn 40 to 50 yuan per day. Therefore, in the past few days, the three of them have each received about 210 yuan. However, this kind of trickery could only last for a while. When the circus reopened for the second time at 9:15 on the 14th,</p>
<h3 id="e154">Thousands of Spectators <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>flooded in like a tide, buying tickets and entering. A ticket collector suddenly noticed that the one-yuan and two-yuan ticket stubs had uneven paper thickness. Upon closer inspection, he realized that they were counterfeit. He reported this to the circus secretary and accountant, Mr. Huike Na, who questioned the audience about where they bought their tickets. They all replied that they bought them at the ticket booth at the entrance. He then reported this to the Western police officer stationed at the site and telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Station, sending Chinese detectives Wang Yongjun and Bao Zhu Shanghe to the ticket booth to arrest the two ticket sellers, Li and Wang. 250 yuan in cash was found on Li's body, 40 yuan was found on Wang's body, as well as 28 counterfeit tickets, two blank sheets of paper, an ink box, and two stamps. They were taken to the police station and confessed that their accomplice, Ren Linxiang, was hiding in Room 120 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road. They then went and apprehended Ren. Ren confessed that the counterfeit tickets were printed at the Fuxing Printing Shop. That night, the Chinese and Western detectives went to Zhonghua Road with detectives from the Public Security Bureau and arrested Li Liu, the owner of the shop, and Yao Jiqing, the apprentice. They seized</p>

<p>200 yuan in cash, and a sample of the counterfeit ticket from the 15th. They were taken to the Public Security Bureau for detention and will be transferred after official procedures are completed. Yesterday morning, the police, along with the witnesses, escorted Li, Wang, and Ren to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang, in addition to recounting the above situation in detail, stated that Li and Wang are now being prosecuted for breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Code, and Ren is being prosecuted for fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. However, Li Liu, the owner of the Fuxing Printing Shop, and Yao Jiqing, the apprentice, as well as the evidence, are still detained in the Public Security Bureau. He requested the court to issue an official document to the police station to facilitate the transfer. Mr. Huike Na, the representative of the Haikjingbo Circus, stated that at 9:15 last night, he received a report from a ticket collector that the one-yuan and two-yuan tickets were</p>

<p>and of inferior quality. Upon careful inspection, I realized that they were counterfeit. I questioned them and found out that they were sold by ticket seller No. 2, so I reported it to the police officer. Spectator Ma Xiupu testified that he went to the circus at 3:00 PM on the 14th to buy four one-yuan tickets and went to see the circus with four friends that evening. The ticket collector said that the tickets were fake. I was unaware. I then went to the police station with a letter of guarantee. Spectator Shen Jinxia testified that he bought two one-yuan tickets and two six-jiao tickets last night, which were also fake. Upon questioning, Li Zhongyun confessed, "I was hired as a ticket seller at the circus with Wang when it opened. These counterfeit tickets were first</p>

I did not participate in this at first. It was a conspiracy between Li and Ren. Two days later, I discovered the secret and also earned 115 yuan." Ren Linxiang also admitted to the accusation, stating that he discussed it with Li and Wang, and went to a Western trading company to buy real tickets and took them to the Fuxing Printing Shop for printing. He confessed that he had earned 150 to 160 yuan, which he had used to buy clothes. After verifying the confessions, Judge Wu Tingying ordered the three defendants to be returned to custody, pending further investigation and questioning in seven days.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's model steamer on the Yangtze River route, the Jianghua, loaded passengers and cargo in Hankou and sailed downstream back to Shanghai. Many passengers boarded in Hankou. As usual, it was necessary to check passenger tickets near Wuxue to prevent unauthorized boarding. The purser, Mr. Wang, checked the tickets one by one. On the outer platform of the upper deck, he found a passenger who had not purchased a ticket and had混入the ship. As usual, the purser asked him to buy a ticket, but the passenger claimed to be a hawker selling food and insisted on not buying a ticket, leading to an argument.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Suddenly Falls into the Water During the Argument <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the purser, Mr. Wang, and a steward named Tang Sheng said, "Since you are a hawker, you should show the goods you are selling." The passenger then took out a bamboo basket from the cabin, containing two baked cakes. The purser said, "Since you are a hawker, why don't you have any food? You are obviously pretending." The steward Tang Sheng suddenly snatched the basket from the passenger. In the ensuing chaos, the hawker and the steward became entangled. Later, the hawker and the bamboo basket somehow fell into the Yangtze River from the Jianghua. After the hawker fell into the water, the business manager immediately ordered the ship to stop and lower a sampan to search, but there was no trace of him.</p>

<p>The Jianghua continued to Jiujiang as usual. According to the crew members on the upper deck, a small boat rescued the hawker after he fell into the water, and the matter seemed to be over. However, when the Jianghua arrived at the Jiujiang dock, a group of more than 200 hawkers gathered and boarded the ship to question the purser about why they had pushed the hawker into the Yangtze River, causing him to be in danger. About 60 hawkers boarded the ship, while more than 200 people were at the dock to provide support. An argument broke out, and a major brawl ensued.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Several Crew Members Injured <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The hawkers came specifically to cause trouble and retaliate. About five of those who boarded the ship appeared to be leaders. As soon as a fight broke out, they assaulted anyone they encountered. Among the crew members who were injured were Chief Officer Chen, Purser Wang, and several stewards. Some had head injuries, some had body injuries, and some had injuries to their hands and feet. The hawkers also damaged many items in the purser's office. Fortunately, the military police on board intervened to stop the fighting, otherwise the situation would have been even worse.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Ship Plate and Mailbox Seized <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>During the melee, the hawkers broke into the purser's office, vandalized objects, and even seized the ship's plate and mailbox, preventing the Jianghua from sailing. After this incident, the hawkers first reported to the local Public Security Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters, claiming that the Jianghua had pushed someone into the water. Therefore, after the incident, the Garrison Headquarters sent troops on board to investigate the truth. The crew members reported the incident.</p>

<p>During the assault, five leading hawkers were detained by the military police on the Jianghua. Later, the Jiujiang Garrison Headquarters sent personnel to the ship and took the five men away to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. As for the steward Tang Sheng, the hawkers claimed that he was the one who pushed the person into the water, so personnel from the Garrison Headquarters also took him away to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The ship plate and mailbox were returned by the Public Security Bureau, and the ship was then able to set sail for Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Jianghua arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the business manager immediately went to the head office to report the incident to the department heads. He stated that the hawkers would likely seek revenge when the Jianghua passed Xunyang on its upstream voyage, which could lead to a major incident. He requested the company to telegraph the central government and ask the local military police to provide protection. As for the person who was pushed into the water, the Xunyang Public Security Bureau will interrogate the steward to clarify the matter. How the hawkers who committed the assault will be punished is still unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Shanghai Brewery's Negligence; Part of the Bottle Stopper Factory Burns Down <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Brewing Company, located at No. 420 Gordon Road, Yichang Road, has been expanding its operations in recent years. Dozens of seven-story cement factory buildings have been added next to the original factory site, and some of the construction has been completed. As such, the factory relocated its bottle stopper manufacturing to the fourth floor of the new building. The procedure for manufacturing bottle stoppers involves first applying heated pitch to a foreign-made utensil, and then applying cork slices to prevent leakage. As such, the workshop contained items such as pitch, cork, and stoves. At 5:00 PM yesterday, after the factory closed, thick smoke suddenly filled the bottle stopper manufacturing room, quickly causing a fire. Furthermore, pitch is an easily combustible substance. Before long, flames burst out from the gaps in the cement walls. Neighbors and guards nearby smelled the pitch and noticed that the cement factory walls had been burned. They rushed to report to the Yichang Road fire department and notified the police. After receiving the news, the fire department rushed to the scene with hose carts to extinguish the fire, but the bottle stopper room had become a fire pit, making it impossible to enter. They then applied water from outside the windows. However, the fire was raging and it was difficult to extinguish at that time. They quickly notified the Central Fire Department and other departments to dispatch vehicles to assist in the firefighting efforts. The fire began to subside at around 6:45 PM and was soon extinguished. However, the interior of the room was reduced to ashes. Fortunately, the walls were made of cement, so other factory buildings were not affected, otherwise the consequences would have been disastrous. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. However, according to bystanders, it may have been caused by unextinguished ashes. The losses were significant.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Another Fire Reported in Tanzi Bay <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the weather has been dry, and there have been no fewer than six or seven fires in the shacks of the poor in the Zhabei area due to carelessness. Tanzi Bay and Hengfeng Road have been the worst hit, with victims having nowhere to live, resulting in a very tragic situation. Unexpectedly, at 1:15 AM yesterday, another fire broke out in a shack on wasteland to the west of the Tanzi Bay Dayang Bridge. Xu Zaixiang, a Jiangbei native, was engaged in pig farming and built a shack in this area. The night before, after falling asleep, he forgot to turn off the kerosene lamp. While tossing and turning, he knocked the lamp off the table, causing the oil to spill onto the straw, immediately causing a fire that spread quickly. When Xu Zaixiang awoke from his dream, it was already impossible to rescue the situation. He rushed out to call for help, and the neighbors were awakened at the same time, rushing to escape. There was chaos as people shouted and screamed. The police station dispatched from the fourth district, third precinct was informed and immediately dispatched police to the scene to suppress the situation. They also notified the Zhabei fire departments to dispatch vehicles to the scene to extinguish the fire. Fortunately, the rescue was early, and a major disaster was avoided. As a result, more than ten shacks were burned down, and a rental rickshaw company was also affected, suffering significant losses. The fire starter, Xu Zaixiang, was taken to the police station for questioning after the incident and was sent to the General Bureau for investigation yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Wuxi Kidnappers Arrested in Shanghai; Renowned Doctor Zhu Yunting Redeemed with Two Thousand Gold Pieces <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>One Kidnapper Arrested After Fleeing with the Ransom</p>
<p>There is a man named Zhu Yunting in Beishikou, Wuxi County, who practices medicine and sells it in his hometown. Many people come to his door seeking treatment, and it is common for nearby villages to invite him. As his income from medical consultations was substantial, his family gradually became wealthy, attracting the attention of bandits who regarded him as a cash cow. They had repeatedly considered kidnapping him but had no opportunity. On September 15th, the bandits sent their accomplices to Zhu's house, pretending to invite him to treat a patient at a certain place, luring Zhu out of his house. After gaining control, they fled. When they arrived at the riverbank near the Qingqi Bridge, a pre-arranged bandit boat was docked. They immediately took Zhu aboard and hid him among the reeds. They then demanded a ransom of 5,000 yuan from his family for his release. After secret negotiations conducted by local officials, the Zhu family safely redeemed Zhu Yunting with 2,000 gold pieces at the Guanyin Temple in Bazibqiao, five miles from the city of Wuxi. After the incident, the Wuxi County Government, after hearing about it, summoned Zhu to the county to inquire about the kidnapping in detail. They also ordered detectives to investigate the bandits' whereabouts within a specified period to eliminate future troubles and ensure the safety of the residents. According to reliable sources, the kidnappers fled to Shanghai after dividing the ransom and mixed into the concession. The county magistrate issued an arrest warrant and sent Wu Zhengrong, the county government police chief, to Shanghai to conduct a strict investigation. On the afternoon prior, he requested the assistance of the Consular Police, and detective Yu Haibo and western detective Black rushed to the Xinlongyuan Tea House at No. 501 Bei Shaanxi Road and arrested Yu Hailin, a native of Wuxi. Yu was taken to the police station for questioning. According to Yu's confession, he admitted that he was involved in the kidnapping and that he received 30 yuan. His other accomplices were hiding at No. 25, Lane 129, Route Pere Robert, in the French Concession. The police rushed to apprehend them, but they found nothing. Yesterday morning, Yu was sent to the First Special District Court, where he was questioned by Judge Wu Ziqi. Police Chief Wu presented an official letter requesting the transfer of custody to Wuxi County Government. When questioned by Wu, Yu did not deny the confession made at the police station. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the police had no objection to the transfer requested by the Wuxi County Government. Judge Wu then approved the transfer of Yu Hailin to Police Chief Wu to be taken back to the Wuxi County Government for trial.</p>

<p>The case of strongman Zha Rui Long being sued by his cousin Zha Rui Lian in the First Special District Court for embezzling inheritance was scheduled for continued hearing yesterday afternoon. Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the fifth criminal court to hear the case. Defendant's lawyer Yuan Yang'an stated first that the defendant had filed a counterclaim against the plaintiff for slander, etc. Judge Wu then transferred the case files from the District Court to the plaintiff's lawyer and asked him to point out the points of embezzlement. After reviewing the case files, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that although there was no evidence of embezzlement by Zha Rui Long in the case files, there was one point: after Zha Rui Long and his sister Xin Yuan reached a settlement, the siblings of the defendant's side had offered 1,000 yuan for marriage expenses, but the money was in the defendant's custody and he refused to hand it over, which was sufficient to prove embezzlement, etc. Subsequently, Judge Wu persuaded both parties to reconcile, stating that since the two parties were brothers, even if there were monetary disputes, they could be discussed and resolved from there, and there was no need to litigate and harm feelings, etc. After considering the matter, the plaintiff agreed to withdraw the lawsuit, and Zha Rui Long also expressed his willingness to withdraw the counterclaim. The court then ruled that the case was not accepted, and the case was concluded.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Physicians Association Requests the Establishment of Autopsy Centers in Nanshi and Zhabei <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Physicians Association believes that there are no autopsy centers in Nanshi and Zhabei in the Chinese district, and autopsies are often performed on the spot, which not only hinders traffic but also harms public health. Yesterday, they specifically passed a resolution at the autumn general meeting to "request the local authorities to quickly establish autopsy centers in Nanshi and Zhabei to emphasize public safety and public health." The document was submitted to the Municipal Government and the District Court, stating, "Petition for the establishment of autopsy centers in Nanshi and Zhabei, two districts of this city. It is noted that Nanshi and Zhabei are adjacent to the concession, and the International Council has agreed to this. For more than twenty years, local construction and successive clinics have been established, which is a symbol of civilization and progress, and all citizens enjoy the benefits of the community. But if you try to recall, the most important public service, the autopsy center, is still lacking. In the past, it was still possible to excuse it as Zhu Changming of forensic medicine, and there was a lack of specialized talents, and no one dared to move the body lightly, so they had to be examined on the spot. But today, forensic research has its own specialized institutions, and there is no lack of talents. The examination has scientific methods to support it, and there is no need to prohibit the movement of the deceased. Moreover, Shanghai opened up earlier and is the crown of the golden country. In the concession, where bodies are disposed of, there are two autopsy centers, but in the large area of Nanshi and Zhabei, which are surrounded by them and under the sovereignty of our country, there is something lacking. This not only leaves foreigners with reason for scorn, but Shanghai is also affected because there are no autopsy centers. Once a murder occurs, it is bound to cause a sensation, disrupt order, and sometimes expose corpses and flesh, attracting flies and mosquitoes, which hinders hygiene. Even worse, the restriction on moving the body leads to local ruffians, cunning officials, and slippery officials stirring up trouble and extorting money. Innocent people are implicated, and the harm is so great. Our local authorities have also heard about it from time to time. Why has there been no reform to this day? Perhaps this area is impoverished and it is difficult to raise funds, so the discussion has been temporarily postponed. However, the establishment of an autopsy center is related to national image and social order and public health. If this can be delayed, what cannot be delayed? Moreover, how much can it cost to establish one or two autopsy centers? The association has seen this and dares to express its opinion. We request that your government (court) work with the Shanghai District Court (Municipal Government) to quickly plan and select appropriate locations and establish autopsy centers in Nanshi and Zhabei within a specified period to benefit citizens and improve the city's appearance. In addition to the official submission, we respectfully request that you review and implement this for the public good."</p>

The resignation was unavoidable. The committee has appointed executive members Zhang Yuansheng and Liu Daokui at the twelfth meeting of the executive committee. The appointment has been reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for record-keeping. The two standing committee members have assumed their duties and attended to their affairs.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>Regarding an item in the "Local News" section of yesterday's newspaper, titled "Land Value Tax Assessment Standards, Valuation Review Begins," the final paragraph stated that if landowners had concerns regarding the assessed value, they could, when the tax collection begins next year, go to the land tax collection office in the commercial district, state their reasons, and request corrections. However, this differs from the information released by our bureau. According to Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for the Collection of Land Value Tax, if a property owner has objections to the announced land value, they must submit a valid reason and apply to the Land Bureau within the prescribed time limit for submission to an arbitrator for arbitration. We hope you will investigate and make the necessary corrections. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, Second Division, November 15, 1933.</p>

<p>The Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education, in response to a request from the China Educational Film Association, has sent a letter to embassies stationed abroad, requesting the collection of film censorship regulations from various countries, as well as publications related to film. The original letter stated that the association is an organization dedicated to using film to assist education and promote culture. As China's film industry is developing rapidly, there is an urgent need to compile a film yearbook to understand the past and guide future trends. The yearbook is now being compiled by a committee organized by Chen Lifu, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Pingling, Li Jiaxiang, Li Jingmi, Dai Bi, and Zhang Changren. In addition to detailing the current state of China's film industry, it is planned to include the film regulations of various countries and the organization of film censorship agencies for reference. Therefore, the association is requesting the Ministry's assistance in forwarding a letter to embassies stationed abroad, requesting them to collect the film regulations and related publications from the Ministry of Interior or Education of the countries where they are stationed. The collected publications should be compiled and sent back to China by December of this year to facilitate compilation. We would be grateful. Accordingly, we are writing to request investigation and action and a reply as to the outcome.</p>

<p>Since taking office, Pan Guqiang, Director of the National Military Education Department of the Training Directorate, has spared no effort in rectifying military training in schools. On the 9th of this month, he summoned more than ten military instructors from Nanjing schools to give instructions, stating that the biggest reason for the failure of military training in schools in the past was that there were too many students and only one instructor per school.

According to the new measures, all instructors in Nanjing schools must jointly take responsibility for military training in all schools, and it is stipulated that these measures will be implemented starting on the 13th.

<h3 id="e199">The Student Unrest at Wuben Girls' School Gradually Subsides ▲ Students Will Respond to Transfer Opinions Today ▲ Director Pan Has Agreed to Allow Two Suspended Students to Return to Class <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Since the recent student unrest at the Wuben Girls' Middle School in this city, Education Director Pan Gongzhan has been very angry because the students were instigated and willingly exploited. He adopted strict measures, but since Mr. Pan summoned all the staff to a meeting, the faculty and staff have been willing to make adjustments, so the unrest has subsided and can be resolved within days.</p>
<p>▲Situation at the School Yesterday, more than 300 female students, accounting for about three-fifths of the total number, voluntarily went to school. They maintained calm during morning exercises and self-study. Although the Education Bureau sent personnel to monitor the situation, they did not interfere too much. In addition, several female inspectors were on site to prevent any problems. The school was as peaceful as ever yesterday, but students were still not allowed to use the telephones on campus.</p>
<p>▲Withdrawal of Security Team After the unrest at the school the day before, the fifth squadron of the police brigade from the Municipal Public Security Bureau was dispatched to be stationed there. Since the Chief Secretary of the Municipal Government, Yu, accepted the students' request the day before yesterday, the police officers have withdrawn to the Education Bureau. However, as a precaution, more than ten police officers are still stationed at the school gate to protect the school.</p>
<p>▲Mediation by Faculty and Staff The faculty and staff of the school held a meeting with the heads of all levels of the middle school department at 10:00 AM yesterday, gently advising the students and stating the Education Bureau's attitude towards the matter. Although the heads of all levels have accepted the mediation of the faculty and staff, they must still consult the opinions of all the students, so they will respond today.</p>
<p>▲Education Bureau's Attitude Director Pan Gongyan of the Municipal Education Bureau is currently instructing the faculty and staff to persuade the students, hoping that the students will immediately realize their mistakes and not allow the school to be dissolved. Therefore, the Education Bureau did not express anything yesterday, waiting to see how the students will respond today. However, if the students still stubbornly refuse to come to their senses, the Education Bureau will be forced to forcibly remove the students from the school in order to thoroughly rectify the situation.</p>
<p>▲Focus of the Problem The three demands made by the students in this unrest are: (1) Reinstatement of the two suspended students; (2) Removal of Dean of Studies Jiang Wenbao; (3) Restoration of the Student Self-Government Association. Regarding the first item, the Education Bureau has stated that the two students are temporarily suspended and can return to school with a guarantee from their parents if they repent. The third item is not a problem if they can formally organize according to legal procedures and submit a report to the party and government agencies for record. However, the students still insist on the second item, and the Education Bureau absolutely refuses to allow students to interfere in school administration, fearing that it will set a bad precedent. This has become the focus of the problem, and the Education Bureau will have no choice but to take decisive action.</p>
<p>▲Two Students May Return to Class Li Minhua, a temporarily suspended student, was summoned by Director Pan yesterday and went to the Education Bureau accompanied by her parents. Director Pan asked her about her involvement as a representative. According to her, each grade of the student self-government association had two representatives, totaling twenty-four. The first time four representatives requested an interview with Principal Yan, and the second time eight representatives went. She (Li) did not know Dean Jiang, and it was only because the classmates said they did not want him to come that she, as a representative, had to say that. She did not know the reasons. The student's parents were very understanding and, together with Director Pan, enlightened Li, who then realized her mistakes. Director Pan agreed that after the school reopened, her parents could send a letter stating that she had repented, and she could return to school. As for Fang Xiuzhi, another suspended student, because her parents were in Ningbo, her guarantor, Mr. Yan, went to see Director Pan yesterday and stated that it was natural for the student to repent for her mistakes. Fang had always been a good student, and he could guarantee that she would correct any mistakes she had made, now or in the future. Therefore, after the school reopens and Fang submits a letter of repentance, she will also be able to return to school.</p>

<p>The private Chinese Girls' Junior Middle School applied to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval to establish the school in September of this year. The Education Bureau sent personnel to investigate and found that the principal, department heads, and faculty were not present, and there were no students. Since the school had already enrolled students without permission this semester, there was no need to establish the school. Therefore, the Education Bureau ordered the school to close. Now, the Education Bureau states that the school has not complied with the order to close and is still operating, which is improper. The Education Bureau has ordered the school's board of directors to quickly instruct the school to close down as soon as possible and submit a report for review.</p>

Apart from the Health Bureau, which was unable to send personnel, over ten people attended, including Dr. Barry Smith, representative of the French Consulate, Dr. Zhu Xiangying, representative of the Chinese Medical Association, and Dr. Libaud, Director of the Health Department of the French Municipal Council. They were seated together with the professors of the school. In addition to answering the questions of the professors, the examinees were asked to answer questions raised by the proctors on the spot.

Previously, a grand carnival was held to raise funds, and all the proceeds were used for the free night school for commoners. The date has been set for the 15th of this month and will be held at the Kade Grand Theater in Xinzha. It is said that the performance program on that day includes dramas, harmonica, singing, dancing, and comedies by the Chunhua Drama Society. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>(Jinan Correspondence) Hao Chengsheng, Professor of Physical Education at National Shandong University in Qingdao, was recently hired by the Ministry of Education as a Physical Education Supervisor. He arrived in Jinan yesterday from Qingdao and will take a train to Beijing at 9:00 AM today (the 14th) to take office. The reporter met Mr. Hao on the train as he was leaving Jinan and inquired about everything. Mr. Hao said that since the National Games, the people of the country have generally understood the importance of physical education, so the Ministry of Education hired him as a supervisor and he is going to take office. As for how to promote physical education in the future, there are no specific methods yet, and he will discuss it with various physical education experts. The position of physical education professor at Shandong University that he held has been taken over by Mr. Song Fu, and someone is also responsible for the Qingdao Stadium, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Friendly Football Match: Youyou Defeats Western Captives <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>▲Result: 4 to 3</p>
<p>The Youyou Football Team played a friendly match against the Western Captives Team yesterday at the Zhonghua Baseball Field, with two to three thousand spectators. The two teams had similar skills and the situation was even. In the first half, each team scored two goals, and there was no clear winner. In the end, Youyou won 4 to 3.</p>
<p>▲Each Scored One Goal. The Western Captives kicked off and attacked first, repeatedly penetrating Youyou's territory. Youyou defended strictly, making it difficult for the opponent to get close. After a long stalemate, Zhu mistakenly kicked the ball into the center of the goal within the defense line, giving Defei an easy goal to open the scoring, with Youyou unfortunately conceding the first goal. The whole army was inspired and strived for progress. Sun Xishun rode forward, and Zhong Yongsen raided the camp alone, resulting in a 1-1 tie. Shen Bai sent troops to the border, and Zhong Yongsen revisited the old place. Western Captives' goalkeeper Bochi received and then lost the ball. Zhong lightly tapped it, taking the lead with a score of 2-1. The Western Captives launched a fierce counterattack. Wokele coordinated in the middle, and Gengensheng pounced like a hungry tiger. Qi Yongchun handled the situation improperly, allowing Huo Gengensheng to push his stomach in, resulting in a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>▲Youyou Wins. After resting and re-engaging, eight minutes later, Sun received assistance from Chen Jiaqiu and Li Shuoyou and shot at an angle, and the enemy's goal was lost again. Youyou once again took the lead, but just as they gained in the mulberry field, they lost in the elm field. The Western Captives' forwards advanced step by step, besieging Youyou. After a long struggle between the two sides, Gengensheng secretly crossed the Chencang pass, shot but missed, and met it with his head, finally knocking open the goal, making it a 2-2 draw. Youyou was eager to win and continued to work hard, invading the enemy's camp. Zhong Yongsen took advantage of the opponent's goalkeeper dribbling the ball and unexpectedly kicked it into the net, making it 4-2, giving Youyou the victory. After that, the two armies fought fiercely, and Youyou stepped up their defense to maintain the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e214">A General Overview of Modern Chinese Educational Thought (II) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Lecture by Shu Xin cased, Notes by Sun Yucai</p>
<p>▲The Scope of the Modern Era and the Greatness of the Modern Era</p>
<p>The history of education is as long as that of humanity itself. Therefore, all human history contains the history of educational thought. The "modern era" I am referring to starts from the first year of the Tongzhi reign in the Qing Dynasty to the present. Why do I define it in this way? Because since the establishment of the Tongwen Guan in Beijing that year, the educational system that had evolved over thousands of years in Chinese history gradually began to be replaced by the Western educational system, and the traditional ideas associated with it were gradually destroyed without any remainder. If we compare the educational phenomena of the sixty years after the establishment of the Tongwen Guan with those of the sixty years before its establishment, we will find that they are not only completely different in form but also completely different in content. Moreover, because of all the major problems that have occurred in the world in the past seventy years, such as the Industrial Revolution, that is, the emergence of mechanical industry, since this mechanical monster was produced, handicraftsmen have naturally been eliminated. According to a survey by proponents of technological politics in the United States, a machine with 14,000 horsepower can equal the power of 90,000 people. In 1833, a bricklayer could only produce 450 bricks per day, whereas now, he can produce 400,000 bricks per day. Another example is a cigarette-making machine, which can produce 2,500 cigarettes per minute, and a light bulb-making machine, which can produce 150,000 light bulbs per day. What do these facts illustrate? They show that with a 30,000 horsepower machine and one worker to manage it, 89,999 people will lose their jobs. With a brick-making machine and one worker to manage it, 8,887 people will lose their jobs. The same is true for the light bulb industry and the cigarette industry. The power of machinery is so great that productivity has been greatly increased. However, consumption is still so limited. As a result, international capitalist imperialists, due to overproduction in their own countries, have been competing to colonize overseas markets. China, with its vast territory and large population, is a place where everyone wants to trade. As a result, since then, China has opened its borders, and its economic system has been reformed. According to relevant statistics, the trade deficit was 80 million yuan the year before last, and it increased to 100 million yuan last year. This means that the silver and money of our country are flowing out in large quantities. How can the people's property and the rural economy not be bankrupted? Due to the occurrence of the Industrial Revolution craze, the social situation in China has gradually affected the villages from the cities. Bankruptcies and unemployment have increased by the thousands, leading to the situation we have today. Naturally, at the same time, this has also affected the changing layers of educational thought.</p>
<p>▲The Purpose of Studying Modern Educational Thought</p>
<p>The new education in China over the past seventy years can truly be said to have been groping in the dark. Although it has cost a lot of manpower and money to earnestly seek a way out, it has still not found a smooth and broad road. The confusion in the intellectual community has only become more serious since the introduction of Western learning. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education the year before last, there are a total of 8.8 million elementary school students in China. If they study for six years, wouldn't there be at least one million graduates each year? What do these one million elementary school graduates do? They simply put on long gowns and look for consumer jobs that don't require manual labor. Children in the countryside are now rarely willing to farm, carry burdens, or cook. There are more than 400,000 middle school students. If they study for six years, there are about 60,000 graduates each year. What do these 60,000 middle school graduates do? Naturally, they follow the example of elementary school graduates, but with an added layer. As for college students, it goes without saying that they are even more like young masters and bureaucrats. This year, there are more than 1,000 college graduates in Shanghai. As far as I know, less than 20% or 30% have found jobs. As a result, everyone has no way out and no solution. However, people have to eat. As Mencius said, "Food and sex are human nature." The current situation is that many people in the intellectual community have nothing to eat, so naturally there will be trouble. No wonder the whole society is filled with extreme squeezing and extreme panic. Squeezing and pushing, you squeeze me, and I squeeze you, and it never seems to get on the right track. To save China, the most important thing now is to stabilize the social order and solve the people's livelihood problems. Now that we understand the situation in society and the education world, I will now talk about the purpose of studying modern educational thought. Educational thought contains extremely complex issues. It is very difficult to understand them all. Even if we understand them clearly, we know that education is not an independent social activity. Everything is subject to the limitations of other social activities. Even if there is a perfect plan, it cannot be realized by education itself. Therefore, the purpose of our study of educational thought is:</p>
<p>(1) To use the concept of historical evolution to prove that all kinds of educational thought are the best solutions to cope with the environment and solve problems at the time. They are not universal truths that everyone can create, and they do not necessarily have to be copied from foreign countries. (2) To use objective facts to prove that educational thought is produced by educational practice. The actual situation in society is the source of thought. In studying the history of thought, we must not abandon the facts and engage in empty talk. (3) To seek out the causes and consequences of modern Chinese educational thought from historical evidence to provide some materials for creating new education suitable for China. (4) To seek evidence from history to prove that education is not an independent social activity and is often subject to other phenomena, so that educators will strive to transform society in addition to education.</p>
<p>(Thought) Now that we have gained a general understanding of "educational thought" and the "scope and purpose of the modern era," let us now turn to the history of thought itself.</p>

<h3 id="e215">A Kind of Funeral Worth Introducing <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>I once saw a funeral procession in Jinan, with a band of stilt performers in the middle of the procession. When they reached a lively intersection, everything stopped to watch the stilt performance. I almost thought it was a competition. In Suzhou, I often heard people who loved to watch the excitement boasting about when a certain family would have a "grand send-off of the coffin." I never understood what the meaning of this kind of funeral was or what it had to do with the deceased.</p>
<p>Even the management of the funeral, the ancestral tablet consecration ceremony, the opening of the mourning hall, the public memorial service, and the extravagance of the selection of the date, friends and relatives are also "going through the motions." Confucius said, "Eating beside a mourning house, one does not get full." I regret that he was not born today, otherwise he would surely be able to feel "both drunk and full" every time. This kind of funeral is common among the middle class, as if not doing so would mean not following the rites and wearing mourning properly.</p>
<p>Now there is a funeral that is very different. Instead of going to the countryside to build a grave and dig a pit, the deceased is buried in Anle Garden [the Christian cemetery in Suzhou]. At 2:00 PM the day before, there is a family memorial service, and at the same time, local people hold a memorial meeting in their home. Even the obituary is very unique, divided into three categories: eulogies from friends and relatives, elegies, and mourning announcements, encompassing classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, rhymed prose, and new poems.</p>
<p>The mourning announcement mentions the deceased's virtues, and two things are worth introducing: one is the opening of the family library, and the other is the establishment of an ancestral memorial hall. On the anniversary of the ancestors' death, the practice of monks and Taoists performing repentance ceremonies and chanting scriptures is abolished, and paper ingots and funerary objects are not used. Only a bunch of fresh flowers and a stick of incense are placed in front of the ancestors' portraits and relics. After the children bow in respect, the head of the family explains in detail the ancestors' entrepreneurial endeavors and daily deeds. Everyone silently commemorates them. The traditional etiquette of "worshiping gods as if gods were present" is abolished. This kind of reform, which considers both Chinese and foreign practices and integrates ancient and modern customs, is something we have all thought of, but we have never had the courage to implement.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to explain who is in charge of this funeral. Speaking of it, many people may know, it is Mr. Xu Chuanming, who served as the president of the Southeast Industrial Bank and was elected as a member of the National Assembly. His mother, who observed chastity and raised her children alone, passed away. The Xu family in Suzhou is considered wealthy. If they had "failed to avoid vulgarity," they would have at least made a big fuss for several days. Who would have known that it would be so simple? Isn't it worth introducing to today's society, which is full of vanity? I also hope that "a part of the industry will be used for a rural cooperative venture" (see Hu Bolun's Eulogy). That this statement can be realized in the shortest possible time, then his filial piety will be even greater.</p>

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Two days ago, I happened to meet a gentleman at a banquet who had returned from the recent college entrance examination in the capital. He seemed like one of those newly rich gentlemen. I asked another friend for his name and surname, and I understood it very clearly. However, I cannot write it out, lest I hurt the loyal and honest. This must be declared first. On the surface, this gentleman is indeed extraordinary, exceptionally handsome, and indeed a fashionable figure. Therefore, his conversation is also witty and humorous, often making people laugh. However, he inevitably has the disappointed attitude of Liu Kui, who failed the examination and earned the sadness of a hero. At that time, there were no less than thirty or forty people gathered together and drinking heavily. His every word and sentence made people listen attentively and become silent. It can also be seen that although this examination is not like the former provincial or metropolitan examinations, the general public's desire for vanity has not changed!</p>
<p>He said: "I made quite a fool of myself in this examination. When I was studying at a certain middle school, no matter how eloquently the teacher lectured in the classroom, I would still leisurely read a novel once or twice. Sometimes I would twist peanuts in one hand and peel Liangxiang chestnuts in the other, munching them. Sometimes I would simply rest my head on my arms and sleep. When the bell rang and woke me from my afternoon dream, drool would be streaming down the desk. I would hastily flip through a few books as a show, and then go to another class. Later, I actually got into college, but my laziness in studying and my fear of using my mind became even more serious. Whenever there was opposition to exams, I would always be the first to propose it and organize a strike alliance with the school authorities, fighting until one of us won. This was less than ten years ago. Unexpectedly, now, not only do I not oppose it, but I am willing to go to the examination hall to suffer. Thinking about it, I don't even know why!"</p>
<p>"Alas! At first, I thought this kind of examination would be very convenient. How could I know that the examination officials would ask such difficult questions? Just take the Chinese language question, 'If there are no legalist advisers when entering the country, and no foreign enemies when leaving the country, the country will surely perish.' When I received it, I really couldn't remember. Righteous men, brave men, warriors, strong men, Avalokiteśvara, my father is a gentleman in our hometown, and I have never seen a 'legalist adviser.' How do you expect me to explain the word 'adviser'? Moreover, now that there are 'foreign enemies,' our country is probably going to perish, but it says, 'If there are no foreign enemies, the country will surely perish.' Perhaps 'surely' can be interpreted as 'not,' but if not, how do you expect me to write? And what about 'Yellow Turbans' and 'taking officials as teachers,' these history questions are things I have never stored in my mind. Therefore, although I entered the examination hall this time, I can be considered to have let out a fart in the examination hall, which can be considered as having won a breath for my ancestors." As he spoke, he had a completely arrogant,眉飛色舞 posture, and the listeners were all giggling and laughing.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Women and Wine <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>Wine is life's "comfort" and "stimulant." Therefore, poets, artists, novelists, heroes, beauties... almost all like wine. Women are also life's "comfort" and "stimulant," and have the same effect as wine.</p>
<p>Wine has different flavors, and so do women. The natural charm and gentle elegance of a village girl is like the local Shaoxing Huadiao wine. It is not that there are no beautiful and quiet women in the city, but they are somewhat like the Shaoxing wine sold in liquor stores, with some "water" mixed in. Modern women are like champagne. When the cork is first opened, bubbles burst out, which is very beautiful and trendy, but when you taste it, it is bitter after all. How can it intoxicate people? Village women, spending a lot of money on makeup and imitating others, are like white liquor water. Although some friends from Jiangbei get drunk after drinking it, it cannot be compared with Huadiao and Jingzhuang. As for foreign wines such as brandy and whiskey, we are not used to drinking them. Perhaps they have a different flavor, for overseas students who are reading and courting foreign wives to savor the exotic taste.</p>
<p>From foreign wine costing dozens of yuan a bottle, Jingzhuang, Taidiao, Huadiao, mung bean shochu, almond shochu, Jianquan wine... to white liquor water costing fourteen cents a jin, there are countless kinds of wine. Women are the same. "Smelly shrimp matches smelly vinegar." "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." Wine can intoxicate people, and women can also intoxicate people. Their nature and function are generally the same.</p>
<p>When women drink wine, their almond cheeks blush, and their starry eyes shimmer, naturally making them even more beautiful. Wine can intoxicate people, and women can also intoxicate people. Women plus wine, of course, can intoxicate people even more. In his later years, Lord Xinling used "rich wine" and "women" to end his political life. When heroes grow old, they are so bored, and heartbroken people have unspeakable secrets!</p>

<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Early morning, the streetlights still emitted a dim glow in the haze, some dust particles rolled along the military trajectory, a layer of white frost covered the patrolmen shrinking in the corners, yawning, they glared and saw one, following behind that fresh fish monger’s pole, reaching out to steal, a pretty big one... he deliberately closed his eyes.</p>
<p>On the steps in front of the Swire Company, several vagrants slept wrapped in advertising paper, with a box of cigarettes and a box of matches as usual beside their heads, smoke from the big steamship drifted out of the iron chimney, drifting to the other side of the Pudong sky, and then faded. The sky on that side must be showing different colors, deep blue, grayish-white, tender yellow, tiger yellow, light red... gradually, gradually, clusters of crimson morning clouds stretched out their arms.</p>
<p>Standing on the floating dock, taking a look at the turbid river, the eyes blurred.</p>
<p>The outlines of the buildings on the opposite bank slowly emerged from the smoke, behind that row of billboards were the high and low jetties, and the morning clouds rose into the sky from behind those jetties, half the sky was dyed red by it, the river water was also dyed red by it, rushing like blood.</p>
<p>The ferrymen were probably still in their dreams.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the eastern sky was about to explode, looking at the serious form, the rapid change. The lights along the Bund were all drooping their eyes, not daring to look at the commotion when night and day exchanged. But, the sun finally came out covered in blood, overlooking the earth, laughing proudly, suddenly shaking, and then falling into the river, falling into pieces, pieces following the turbid river.</p>
<p>At this time, there was a white sun in the sky, the lights were useless.</p>
<p>Crowds began another day of survival and labor.</p>
<p>Short News: Zhang Jun's reputation for "Pillow Green Grass Hall" is passed down through the world. It almost overshadows his reputation as a novelist. This cool autumn, he is eager to express his great spirit with ink. From today onwards, Chen Yan will be at Liangchen Friends Society at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road. From 3:00 to 6:00 pm every day, he will wave his pen for guests, reducing the fee by half, and donating rice paper, exempting ink fees, in order to make a connection with calligraphy and painting.</p>

<p>Walking halfway, Yin Deren quietly held Zhao Zizhang's hand and said: "Do you have any feelings?" Zhao Zizhang said: "What feelings do I have? Everyone is the same!" Yin Deren shook his head and smiled: "I am not the same, you can't say that in general. At this time, you realize that it's better to be single." Tian Qing said: "I'm also single, why am I not as happy as you?" Yin Deren smiled: "Are you pretending? Is your being single really clean? Isn't that Ms. Huang a flower that grows on a bare branch? It doesn't matter if the flower that has bloomed is thrown away. This flower hasn’t even been seen what color it is, and it's discarded, which makes people reluctant to part!" Saying that, he patted Zhao Zizhang's shoulder again. What could he say, he could only smile at them. Guan Yaowu was behind the three of them, not saying a word, but sighing heavily. Yin Deren said: "Old Guan, why are you sighing?" Guan Yaowu said: "You are talking about flowers, I don't care, I just can't bear to leave my nest of children." Yin Deren said: "That's still the same, it's better to be single. If you were single from the beginning, how could you have this nest of children?" The four of them were talking, and they had already returned to their respective company headquarters. Zhao Zizhang saw that the lights were all on, so he didn't dare to delay, he first ran to the big kitchen to ask the cooks to make pancakes, the food for more than a hundred people a day was naturally enough to make. After watching for a while, he returned to the company headquarters to supervise the soldiers to pack their small luggage (note: medicine and bullets). In between, he went to the battalion headquarters twice to report to the battalion commander. It can be said that he did not sleep that night. According to the order, they were to gather at the parade ground at seven o'clock to depart. Zhao Zizhang got up at five o'clock. After hurriedly eating breakfast, it was not yet six o'clock. Naturally, the soldiers got up earlier than him. At this time, although the days were long and the nights were short, the sky was still only grayish-white at a little after five o'clock. (241)</p>

<h3 id="e220">Research on the Soul of Peking Opera <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Tiwei</p>
<p>Peking Opera today is declining and falling, on the verge of bankruptcy, which is an undeniable fact, so some people have risen to study the reasons for this decline and the ways to revive it.</p>
<p>Some blame the popularity of mythical and lotus platform plays, but can the theater continue to schedule them if the audience doesn't attend? Some say it is the result of the intrusion of movies in recent years. This seems to say that it's not my fault, it's just that other people are better than me. Does that make sense? So none of these are accurate diagnoses.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the biggest fatal wound in the current decline of Peking Opera is the lack of a "soul". Compared to that time, it's like what Yuan Zicai said, "true nature." For example, the leading actors in the current Peking Opera world are undoubtedly Yu Shuyan and Mei Lanfang. If these two famous actors co-star in a "South Heaven Gate", it is sure to cause a sensation and fill the theater. Everyone has to admit that this play is a perfect match. It can be said that the appearance is beautiful, the singing is excellent. But I want to ask a question: For those who have seen their "South Heaven Gate", has your soul ever felt the suffering of the master and servant on stage? Have you ever shed a tear of sympathy for Miss Cao, who is as hurried as a homeless dog and as busy as a fish that escaped the net? If you say you haven't, then this play is equivalent to not being performed, and the audience is equivalent to wasting time, getting nothing at all.</p>
<p>That is to say, the theater a hundred years ago, although it was a crude stage show with chaotic jumps and shouts, each play had a meaning of loyalty, filial piety, and integrity, which could implicitly hold the supreme authority, and was widely imprinted on the minds of the people. This point is what I call the soul of the theater. Now Peking Opera has slowly degenerated and become a pastime for a few idle classes. No matter if they are amateur performers or professionals, as soon as they open their mouths, they either say that this word has a Hubei accent, or that this tune is in the Tan style or the Yu school, as if the essence of the play is only in the singing, and everything else is trivial. We must understand that the most important skill for an actor is to first grab the audience's emotions as soon as they appear on stage, and then try to express the theme of the play as much as possible, so that the audience can get a correct impression. If the actor can't grab the audience's emotions, no matter how correct the pronunciation or how perfect the tune, it's just a musical film in a movie. If the script has no theme, it is empty and decayed, and it will inevitably fail. We must also understand that what is needed today is definitely not just theater that is pleasant to the ear for the idle class, but theater that can help social education and guide the people. Therefore, in addition to the professionals in the Peking Opera world who study theater for the sake of livelihood, all amateur performers, professionals, and even the people who have had a slight interest in theater should stand up to support and promote theater with a soul.</p>
<p>In short, each play itself must first have a sound theme, and each actor must first be skilled in and rich in stimulating and sincere inner performance. Combining these two beauties can live up to the mission of assisting social education. The single-act plays that are popular now are fragmented and broken, and are really unacceptable. On the one hand, we should promote the original good complete plays, and on the other hand, we should compile new plays that are needed today (such as "Lasting Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty" and "Soul Wrongfully Accused," which are plays with a soul). We should use the rich emotions that Peking Opera uniquely possesses to assist social education. Then, I believe that Peking Opera can survive forever, and will not be eliminated by movies, dramas, slapstick, and other kinds of entertainment. The phonetics of every word and sentence, the small body movements of a fleeting glance or a flick of the beard, and even the study of a pair of boots or a blue and white robe, I think are local and trivial issues, we might as well open up a bit more and discuss them later.</p>

<h3 id="e221">American Bank Exchange Rises Sharply, Bullion Price Breaks Through 700 Yuan Mark ▲Major Players Vigorously Cover Positions, Resulting in a Drop of 7 Yuan▲ <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The gold market actually broke through the 700 yuan mark yesterday, falling to a new low of 696.2 yuan. After the market's momentum was exhausted, it stabilized, and major players aggressively covered short positions, reversing the trend and rebounding by 10 yuan. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw London prices fall and US prices rise. Forward silver prices on the five metals exchange rose by 4 to 8%. Exchange rates continued to surge. London spot gold fell by 6.5 pence, and the US official gold buying price rose by 1.1 pence to $23.56. Stocks fell by $0.48, US cotton rose by 13 points, US wheat saw minimal fluctuations, and the wool market opened with a decline, nearly 10 yuan. Market sentiment was still good, gradually rising from 023 yuan to 06 yuan, but there was still a setback at the morning opening. After the opening, due to the hardening exchange market and rumors of the US issuing 100 million silver coins, coupled with the fact that the HSBC exchange rate was expected to rise sharply by one yuan, the opening price was only around 706 yuan, breaking through the 700 yuan mark and falling rapidly. However, fellow dealers were eager to cover short positions, and major players such as the Guangdong merchants and speculators Wu and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu, etc., bought actively. The gold market then rebounded sharply, quickly rising back above the 700 yuan mark. A Reuters New York dispatch reported that Britain and France might cooperate to resist the US gold buying policy to prevent the sharp depreciation of the US dollar, and that the British government's goal for the US dollar parity would stop at 5.26 yuan, etc. It rebounded by 10 yuan, but the banks were still resistant.

The total drop between the two markets was 5 angles. The transaction volume was 5,000 angles in the morning market and 5,500 angles in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign exchange market was 786 yuan and 8 angles in the morning market, and rebounded by 2 angles to 787 yuan in the afternoon market. As a result, it was 700 angles smaller than the previous afternoon market. The transaction volume was 60,000 angles in the morning market and 35,000 angles in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained the same, still at 350 texts, with a transaction volume of 35,075 strings, totaling 11,500 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Securities and Bond Markets Chaotic, Difficult to Be Optimistic for Now <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no confirmed news about the Min province political turmoil at the Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange, and there was hope of elimination. There was also a move to welcome Hu to Beijing and unite together. The market sentiment gradually stabilized. This kind of rumor was not true, and speculators deliberately promoted it, which caused the market sentiment to be nervous and uneasy. It is still inevitable to be overly sensitive. When the market opened yesterday morning, there were still scattered sales by retail investors. The inter-month volume had not fallen slightly, so there were many sellers, and it fell by a small half of six. Because the layoff was buying steadily on the 4th, the 19th point fell by a small two angles. Since then, the 4th continued to bravely buy in, so it turned up together, so it generally returned to about half a yuan. The salt tax had no increase or decrease this month, and the far-term was slightly better by two and a half angles. After this setback, market sentiment was not easy to cheer up. In the second round, the 4th and 16th still had purchases, and the market price continued to improve by three, five, and six angles, while the unified salt tax turned down by two and three angles again. When the market opened in the afternoon, it uniformly returned to fall by two or three angles to six or seven angles. The salt tax was only five points smaller. At the close of the market, because the government intended to welcome Hu, the Min affairs might not expand, so the price was slightly stronger. Generally, it rebounded by three or four angles, while the unified salt tax still did not improve much. The market price results were mixed, and most of the rises were two or three angles. After that, the exchange rose by eight and a half angles, and it fell by one yuan upon entering. The recent inter-month volume was seven angles smaller, the unified tax was five points smaller, the salt tax was three angles smaller, and 96 points were two angles smaller. The trend is temporarily chaotic, and the future is difficult to be optimistic. The total number of transactions was 17,970,000 yuan, including 5,000 yuan in spot, 7,115,000 yuan in futures unified salt tax, 2,635,000 yuan in troop occupancy, 1,820,000 yuan in the 19 customs, 3,680,000 yuan in the 20 customs, and the rest ranging from tens of thousands to five or seven hundred thousand. Long-term government bonds for seven years have not been done for a long time, and yesterday there were 3,000 spot transactions at a price of 64.8 yuan.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on the 14th first rose sharply by 4 yuan due to speculators' fierce digging, and the atmosphere was booming. Then, the California Public Utilities Commission reduced the fixed fees of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and public utility stocks gradually became unsustainable. Speculators also switched from digging to closing, and the selling atmosphere was strong. The closing price was slightly lower than before. The trading volume for the whole day was 2.17 million shares. The "wheat" market was stable. If the British exchange rate continues to hold, the price should be higher. The public paid much attention to the Ministry of Finance's upcoming declaration, and most predicted that the government would consolidate credit and avoid paper money inflation. When the market opened, both Southern and long positions had sales. New yarn cloth factories had sluggish transactions, and spot demand was also light. The market was firm and high, and the Financial Settlement Agency announced that the price of gold per tael was 33.56 yuan, an increase of one angle and one point. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market reappeared in a weak state, due to a quiet turn in actual demand. All parties felt that the economy was struggling and lacked the ability to accumulate and purchase. Therefore, the market sentiment softened. However, the thread market remained tight, and the stocks of various factories were lacking, and the market price of foreign threads also rose sharply. However, the yarn market had too much hoarding, and the market was difficult to develop.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Human Standard Slightly Down <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>The human standard opened in the previous market, and there were many rumors in the market, resulting in a weakening market atmosphere. However, trading remained calm, and each month fell by four, five, six, and eight points. In the afternoon, it was heard that the raw yarn business was not as good as the previous day, and there were still few buyers. This month fell by one point, and the far month rose by two points. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 9,850 bales. It was found that the sales were 550 bales of Hengyi, 1,250 bales of Dafeng, 1,300 bales of Changfeng, 250 bales of Yukang, and 250 bales of Yuanda. The purchases were 550 bales of Feng, 350 bales of Tonghe, 350 bales of Taixing, 250 bales of Yuanfeng, 300 bales of Chunji, 250 bales of Tongji, and 200 bales of Suijiang.

<p>The cotton market was stable, but although the US cotton rose, the gold market fell miserably, and the exchange rate rose sharply. The exchange price became cheaper and cheaper, so Japanese merchants had no intention of handling Chinese cotton. The raw cotton market was declining, but the standard market was tight, the chips were lacking, and the number of new sellers was reduced. With these reasons, the market was difficult to fall. However, in terms of the general situation, there will inevitably be a change in the future.</p>

<p>The Zheng Biao market opened earlier, with a slight increase in American cotton and a sharp decline in the gold market. There were not many sellers in the market, and prices fell by five to ten cents for each month. In the afternoon, some short sellers covered their positions, and prices rose by five to ten cents for each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 70,600 dan.

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market initially rose due to purchases by spot traders and foreign merchants, but later weakened as some longs took profits. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 12 to 16 points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 4 to 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 4 points. The Bombay cotton market was firm due to short covering by retail investors. As a result, Pinggar rose by half a rupee, Oomra fell by 0.25 rupees, and White Broach fell by half a rupee. (Originally reported by Telegraph on the 14th)</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed an initial decline followed by stabilization. With wheat quotations, Chicago did not fluctuate much, and Canada was better by two or three cents. Because of the residual effect of the continuous transactions of wheat the day before, the market atmosphere was particularly unstable. Opening prices were about two cents lower compared to the previous day. However, because the actual factories did not increase prices, the market gradually stabilized after the second round of trading. The speculative groups in the market took advantage of the small purchases, and the customer groups also slightly absorbed, resulting in a positive outlook in the short term. When the market opened in the afternoon, the quotation of Tianjin's current flour was better by one cent, totaling 2.233 yuan. The Shanxi and Yingkou groups also had December transactions. Therefore, the opening prices of each month still rose. According to the current situation, in the short term, the withdrawal of current flour will not be too small. In the long term, due to the easing of the U.S. exchange rate, it is conducive to the ordering of wheat, and there may be many changes in the future. As a result, this month rose by 1.25 cents, December rose by 2.25 cents, January rose by 0.5 cents, February and March remained unchanged, and April was better by 0.25 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Near Stabilization and Distant Month Decline in Wheat Futures <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a near stabilization and distant month decline. With wheat quotations, Chicago did not fluctuate, and Canada was better by two or three cents. However, after the continued wheat transactions the day before, the market was greatly shaken. Because the source was guaranteed, there should be no problem with future demand. Therefore, after the opening price, the market atmosphere was greatly relaxed, and the selling pressure was also quite strong. This situation was completely affected by the wheat transaction. The current month also fell by three or four cents at the beginning, but then slightly improved due to the slight purchase by the factories. As a result, the current month was better by one cent, December fell by three cents, January fell by six cents, February fell by eight cents, and March fell by seven cents. Since the arrival of current wheat is scarce and factory demand is unchanged, there were no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Excellent Demand for Late Rice <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) There are more than 50 sources, with more than 6,000 shi of goods. The demand for late rice is better, with a total of more than 2,000 packages. However, because too many goods are coming from the Qingjiao and other groups, there are more than 30 ships, resulting in oversupply, and the market is showing a weakening trend, with prices falling by several points. The Su Tong Nangang japonica rice stored in other stores is scarce and tight, and the price is rising. However, the Changbang japonica rice is sluggish and soft, while the Du Yangjian rice is still rare and fragrant, and continues to show a prominent presence. The dark rice is also better than before.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There are 412 ships arriving. The market sales are average. The wine merchants continue to purchase 400 to 500 shi of white rice. The market situation for new japonica rice is tight in the morning and stable in the evening. The sheep Du Bu customers and early indica rice are all trending tight.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Customer Indica Rice Stockpilers Stop Purchasing <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after continuous price increases in customer indica rice, the appetite of the incoming customers was slightly weaker, and the stockpilers were reluctant to buy. Therefore, the sharp increase trend of the past few days has stopped. However, transactions in Guangdong and Fujian have already been activated. In the future, it is expected that there will be a need for continued purchasing. Therefore, the market should not have a large pullback again. Yesterday, in addition to the domestic and stockpilers on this street, the customer chemical industry was still active. The market situation was similar to the previous market. The Tong city purchased 500 packages of Wuxi machine rice from Guangdong, priced at 6.73 yuan. The Min city purchased 300 packages of Jiangxi machine late rice, priced at 7.75 yuan. The Hunan machine Jing purchased 100 packages, priced at 7.4 yuan, and 800 packages of brown rice, priced at 6.1 yuan. Of the 688 packages of Nanjing machine indica rice, a small amount of brown refined rice was purchased by the Xinghua gang, and the rest were purchased by Quanzhou.</p>

<p>The red brown rice market has been quiet for a long time. Recently, a batch of Niuzhuang goods has arrived, totaling eight cars, half of which are medium-quality, which are old goods with red shells. The destination is the domestic rural villages. The local production in Jiangbei has already seen oversupply. There is no possibility of purchasing. There is no other interest. Therefore, these goods are all domestic demand. The selling price is weak at first and then tight, from 2.82 yuan to 2.93 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Sugar Market Raw Sugar and White Sugar Deteriorate <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a decline in the customs gold standard, and transactions were rare. The trend was still weak and lifeless. The association's pan price for 24 raw sugar white ordinary goods was 20.3 yuan, down 0.15 yuan from the previous day. The price for 20 medium sugar white was 15.8 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. There were no transactions. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 20.75 yuan, CW mark was 7.6 yuan, and China No. 1 cotton white was 19 yuan. There were also no transactions. Chaoqing only opened a few dozen bags of Hong Kong Qing at a price of 14.3 yuan.</p>

<p>Bamboo Joint Steel Bars The recent spot goods are very scarce. Therefore, buyers are rushing to buy them. The inventory in the market is not enough for distribution. The standard is exceptionally strong, estimated at more than 120 yuan per ton (2,240 pounds of balance scale), which is better than 5 or 6 yuan before. The one-inch square pattern is even more scarce in spot goods. Therefore, the market price has soared to 140 yuan. It is reported that only a certain hardware store on North Suzhou Road has this product. Other stores are out of stock. The arrival of the next batch of goods is still far away. Therefore, the market outlook is expected to continue to be optimistic. It is found that this product was purchased by the Guiguan Ji Shen Jin Ji Xin Ren Ji Jian Rong Ji and other construction gangs yesterday. Therefore, the transaction volume reached more than 120 to 130 tons.</p>

<p>(London Raw Silk Prices Reported to Have Fallen Again) In the London raw silk market, due to the dumping of Japanese silk at lower prices, the sales of British silk weaving factories are sluggish, and the consumption of raw silk has decreased greatly. As a result, the market price of Chinese silk has also declined. Yesterday morning, British merchants Taihe and others received a telegram from London reporting that the Jing price in London had fallen again. The scale of the Feima brand yarn was only 7 shillings and 4.5 pence per pound, and the Black Lion brand was only 6 shillings and 9 pence, which was 1.5 pence lower than the previous week per pound.</p>
<p>(Xiaoshan Autumn Cocoon Silk Continues to be Shipped to Shanghai) The model silkworm area of Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, has a bumper harvest of autumn cocoons this year. The quality of the cocoon silk is better. European sales are quite active. The Shanghai inventory is insufficient. The autumn cocoon silk stored in the production area by general silk merchants is now being shipped to Shanghai for sale. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou train arrived with 82 pieces again.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Customer Sales Are Increasingly Difficult to Recover) The exchange rate fluctuates, and artificial silk customer sales are increasingly difficult to recover. Yesterday, only Shanghai Five-Star Green Goldfish Liu Hai and other brands of Su Cocoon merchants traded 15 boxes of current and futures goods, priced from 179.5 yuan to 168.75 yuan, net pan.</p>
<p>(The Sales of White Factory Raw Silk Are Also Sluggish After Adjustment) The U.S. exchange rate continues to rise, and the price of New York silk is getting smaller. The current price of raw silk in Lyon and London is also rising due to the continued increase in prices. The price difference is small. Chinese silk merchants believe that the loss is too large. Therefore, they are unwilling to sell it. The price of white factory raw silk from the mainland is also expected to fall. The market atmosphere is calm. Yesterday, only Hangzhou Silk Factory purchased 15 packages of current white factory raw silk, and Xinshichang purchased 10 packages of white dry raw silk. The prices are all trending weaker.</p>

The Luzhuang Pingshui Zhenmei, Xiehe and Tongfu and other firms have also purchased a small amount. The Luzhuang selling price is 127 yuan, and the Pingshui selling price is 30 yuan. The trend of the tea market is still rising and falling.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Three Treasures of National Goods <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>Good Quality | Low Price | Comprehensive Service</p>
<p>Mencius said: "The treasures of the princes are three: land, people, and governance." One day, a reporter happened to pass by a company on Nanjing Road and suddenly saw six large characters displayed prominently. Therefore, imitating Mencius's words, he got a sentence: "The reporter said, the treasures of national goods are three: quality, price, and service." Mencius's words have Zhu Xi to annotate them. The reporter's words can only be explained by himself with a thick face.</p>
<p>(1) Quality In the past, there was a saying, "Even if it's broken, it's always Hangzhou goods." Because the people of Hangzhou manufacture goods with the true color of "Hangzhou iron head," which is very reliable. Selecting authentic materials and using real craftsmanship to pursue exquisite products is worthy of admiration. Therefore, for national goods factories to develop their business and for their products to become popular, the first thing is to pursue exquisite materials. Crude and shoddy products are not good business. Changed products are not heroes. Only pursuing the quantity of products and not the quality is not the policy that manufacturers should take.</p>
<p>(2) Price When the quality is good, the price must be appropriate. National goods having excellent quality is the duty of national goods factories. Never raise prices arbitrarily because of the good quality, or take advantage of the year of national goods promotion to profit from it and raise prices very high, causing those who love to use national goods to hesitate or buy with disappointment. I often say: Of course, doing business is about making money and getting rich, but making money and getting rich should not be measured on customers. It is still necessary to focus on the manufacturing side. How can raw materials be cheaper, how can labor be saved, how can consumption be reduced, and how can the output be increased? If you can put effort into this, the price will naturally be low, customers will naturally gather, and sales will naturally expand.</p>
<p>(3) Service I ran to a company sincerely wanting to pick a few kinds of national goods, but the clerks were lazy, rigid, and harsh. They answered one sentence for every two sentences asked, and half a sentence for every sentence asked. They seemed lifeless and impatient to deal with me, exchanging my enthusiasm for their coldness. Then, even if I had twelve points of enthusiasm for using national goods, I could only thank them for their kindness and go elsewhere. Alas! Are these clerks having any grudges against national goods? Can you bear to do this? I ask you, what are you eating? You are the customers of your food and clothing parents. Can you bear to neglect them like this? Then, you should go home, accompany your wife, and hold your son. You don't need to stay in the national goods company to be a molecule who hates national goods. One day, Feng Zhongqing told me: His wife initially did not want to buy anything at a company, but a clerk took out one thing and another, speaking vividly and with great relish. Mrs. Feng was very satisfied and bought dozens of yuan of goods. In fact, the budget was at most two or three yuan. With this clerk who provided comprehensive service, she bought twenty times more goods. Clerks should be like this to be qualified. But the thing to say back is, the current level of living is getting higher and higher, and general clerks feel that they are struggling to support their families and feel that the treatment is meager. Therefore, they are not happy to do things. In fact, managers have eyes. If you work hard, you will definitely not suffer in the future. Moreover, after the business develops, the company makes money, and the bonus for clerks will definitely be a lot. It is up to the clerks themselves to do it. Complaining about others and neglecting customers is deceiving others and taking the blame.</p>
<p>National Goods, Talk</p>
<h3 id="e246">Women and National Goods <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Ci Yun</p>
<p>This year is the National Goods Year, the National Goods Year in the midst of national crisis.</p>
<p>In the minds of the general bourgeois ladies, there are no national goods at all. Everything they use must be authentic foreign goods, because they think that foreign goods must be good and fashionable. This is really a psychology of national subjugation.</p>
<p>National goods companies have posted huge advertisements, and the gentlemen who promote national goods are enthusiastically shouting, "Chinese people use Chinese goods!" But they don't pay any attention and are only looking for what foreign goods have arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Poor people certainly don't have the money to buy foreign goods. Even cheap and high-quality domestic goods, they don't have the money to buy. They sell their labor for a living and struggle all day long. It is already very difficult not to be hungry. The things they use are old and broken, so they have to use them for a while.</p>
<p>Ladies! For the sake of the country and the national crisis, you should break this vain psychology, embrace the principle of using only national goods, realize yourself, and persuade your friends to use national goods as well. Then, at least give foreign goods a huge blow and give national goods a powerful help.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Where Does the Failure of National Goods Lie? <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Speaking of the National Goods Year and comparing it to reality, no one denies that it is extremely painful. The National Goods Year... is just a good-sounding term?</p>
<p>However, why have national goods failed to this point? Silk factories are closed, foreign rice is prevalent, silk sales are sluggish. For everything, we only see foreign goods raising their heads. What about national goods? It is like an abandoned woman wandering on the wrong path. I would like to ask: If this continues, will this abandoned woman still live?</p>
<p>To explore the root cause, we should know where its root is. If we understand the root cause, then we can prescribe the right medicine. As far as I know, there are several points:</p>
<p>(1) It is Speculative Remember the European War era, silk, yarn, and factories sprang up like mushrooms. Regardless of the quality of the products, they accelerated production to make money. They did not care about the strength of their capital. Before long, the war clouds dissipated, and silk, yarn, and factories were completely defeated, resulting in today's miserable modern era. Other manufacturing industries also have a speculative mentality. If you want a business to not fail, how can you get it?</p>
<p>(2) It is Lack of Perseverance Creating national goods, one failure, and you are discouraged and sigh. You have no perseverance to struggle. Or a national goods business fails, and you go to change to another kind of national goods. You don't want to already failed businesses to seek their final victory.</p>
<p>(3) It is Trapped in Finance Bank bosses choose to lend to so-called good brands that do not worry about economic turnover, and accommodate their customers. If they encounter a talent who invents national goods and wants to borrow money to create, they don't even talk about wanting money. Even if it is a factory that has become a great business, they can discuss how much money to use if the market is good. If they encounter a slump, they reject people thousands of miles away and are unwilling to help people in times of crisis, and expect them to revive and get a prosperous business. Those gentlemen have short-sightedness and do not think that they themselves also have the responsibility to promote national goods. This is why national goods have hope, but fail because the financial resources are not provided...</p>
<p>(4) It is Accommodation National goods are not good and should be improved. Manufacturers must not disregard the quality of the goods and blindly accommodate customers, causing them to be despised. Even good national goods will be affected in the same way, eventually leading to failure!</p>
<h3 id="e248">National Goods Marriage <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>Recently, people in Shanghai have implemented Mussolini's doctrine, and marriage is very popular. At the end of last month, it was said that there were about three thousand marriages in one day. Blind fortune tellers chose this auspicious day, and three couples became certified in one day. They also had to invite a witness. But I was also very busy. Counting on my fingers, I witnessed five marriages in one month. People said, what is the point of being a witness? I said there is nothing else. I did a great job when I witnessed the marriage, and it was also a promotion of national goods. You think that people come to weddings to eat happy wine and catch up with the excitement. There are old ladies, young ladies, young misses, country girls, and modern women. Eating happy wine is secondary. The first thing is to watch the wedding, look at the bride and groom, and also look at the witness and listen to the witness's words. At that time, I said a word, and they heard a word in their ears. It was really a good opportunity to instill ideas. I said:</p>
<p>The bride and groom wore national goods clothes to get married. This kind of national goods marriage is the most valuable. (Applause) In the future, in the new room and in the new family, everyone should check whether there are any foreign goods or enemy goods? (Applause) The bride must remember! In the future, the most beautiful clothes are national goods clothes. (Applause)</p>
<p>In the future, if the groom buys foreign goods or enemy goods, the bride can go on strike in the new room. (Applause)</p>
<p>In the future, if the bride buys foreign goods or enemy goods, the groom can cut off the economic supply. (Applause)</p>
<p>Little sisters and little brothers, listen! In the future, the first condition for engagement is whether you can implement the use of national goods? (Applause)</p>
<p>National Goods Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e249">How to Increase the Efficiency of Promoting National Goods? <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>"Promote national goods," "Promote national goods." This movement has been carried out vigorously several times, but what is its effect? Where is the achievement it has shown? This is a question that deserves our doubt.</p>
<p>"Promote national goods," why can't it achieve great results? There are many reasons for this, but the fact that those at the top cannot lead by example, and that the people of the country despise government orders and do not implement them, are the main reasons. There is no doubt about this!</p>
<p>Now, the author humbly offers a few suggestions below. If they can be implemented effectively, the national goods movement will surely have a huge effect. And these articles and several meetings will have greater results.</p>
<p>(1) Government authorities and public officials of various agencies must use national goods. Those who violate this will be dismissed. (Except for those who have no national goods to use.)</p>
<p>(2) Agencies and organizations must purchase national goods. Those who violate this must be ordered to compensate the purchaser, and those who violate this more than twice will be dismissed. (This method is practiced in Japan and has achieved great results.)</p>
<p>(3) School teachers and staff must purchase national goods for their supplies. Those who violate this will be dismissed if 100% of the materials used are not Chinese materials.</p>
<p>(4) Party staff must use national goods for their supplies. Those who violate this will be expelled from the party.</p>
<p>The above four points seem too strict on the surface, but if they can be earnestly implemented, the national goods movement will have a satisfactory result. However, the most important point is that government authorities, public officials, party staff, and school teachers and staff can lead by example. Then, there may be great effects to be received. Confucius said: "When those above have a good preference, those below will surely have a greater preference." This is a very good motto.</p>
<p>National Goods Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e250">Shortcomings and Improvements of National Goods Rice Hulling Machines <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this journal, there was an article about the introduction of rice hulling machines. Now, the reporter has more opinions on the shortcomings and improvements of the machine, and is willing to publish them in this journal. I hope that the manufacturing companies will study and improve it, which is also a way to promote national goods. Let's list the shortcomings and improvement methods below:</p>
<p>▲ Current Shortcomings of the Machine</p>
<p>Although the movement and connection of the machine are good, there are still many shortcomings. Now, the reporter will add a judgment as far as he can reach: (1) There is no shield in front of the machine, so the grains under the track are scattered all over the field, and it takes effort to collect them again. (2) Because of the huge piercing force of the nails, short and thin rice straw is often mixed into the hulled grains, making it difficult to separate. (3) In addition to the foot pedal, which can be used to apply force slightly due to the lever effect, the rotation of the cylinder has not been applied with any force-borrowing objects, and it is even more inconvenient to have two people work together and step on it at the same time.</p>
<p>▲ Overview of Improvement Methods</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned shortcomings, it can be improved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Add a 35 kg flywheel to the left end of the cylinder. Sensen iron can be used. The diameter should be 1 meter. The thickness of the edge can be differentiated according to the material. Then, due to inertia, it can help rotate and save a lot of effort.</p>
<p>(2) Install a fox-faced shield board in front of the cylinder to prevent the grains from scattering and returning to the container.</p>
<p>(3) Since the flywheel has been added, the power of one person can maintain it, and there is no need for two people to step on it at the same time. Therefore, the length of the machine box can be narrowed, and 60 cm is enough.</p>
<p>(4) Two fan-shaped leaf blades with a length of 40 cm are installed in the flywheel inner file to make them rotate smoothly, blowing the short rice straw out of the box to replace the winnowing.</p>
<p>(5) If the fuselage is too short after adding the flywheel leaves and wooden boards, it may be placed on a wooden box container underneath, the volume of which is 60 cm high, 60 cm wide, and 90 cm long; which is equal to the improved machine box volume; then, when the machine parts are not in use, the blades, shield wooden boards, foot pedals, etc. can be stored in the storage, and like two and a half tables, they can be picked up and transported, and when in use, they can sleep horizontally on the ground to hold grains, one move is used several times, although it costs more, but its use is infinite. And if you unload the flywheel and mention the three grains of heart that are needed for promoting national goods Xie Dihuan writes</p>
<p>If the two boxes are combined, in an economical family, adding a tabletop can be used as a dining table, which is even more convenient and practical.</p>
<p>The above is only the reporter's humble opinion. I hope that people with knowledge will make corrections, and I hope that the local gentry of each township will invest in manufacturing, and must seek more shipments, and do not have to calculate the thickness of the interest, so as to revitalize the rural economy. The reporter hopes.</p>

<h3 id="e251">The Importance of Leading by Example for Elementary School Teachers <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Qinwen</p>
<p>Shanghai has a plethora of elementary schools. If you're willing to wander around, you'll see those blue signs with white characters for "○○ Elementary School" everywhere. They're truly eye-catching, so many that you can't count or remember them all.</p>
<p>This is a good phenomenon, because the development of children's education can nurture countless good citizens. A weak country can rely on it to become strong, and an impoverished people can rely on it to become rich. However, to educate children, there must be good teachers, and only then can children be cultivated. For example, a piece of jade in the rough, if the carving skills are exquisite, then the jade can become a valuable treasure. But if the skills are not good and one haphazardly wields the knife, then a good piece of jade will surely be ruined to the point of being worthless!</p>
<p>Promoting domestic goods is the duty of every citizen! And elementary school teachers, in particular, must recognize that they are citizens of this country. What they eat, wear, and use must be domestic goods. Then, the children will see this and naturally imitate them. The sales of domestic goods can increase as a result, and the country's economic difficulties can be eased. If those teachers disregard the country and the children, as described in the "Dream of the Red Chamber," with their hearts "blinded by lard," they must wear foreign goods and use imported goods. When the children see this, they will imitate them, developing habits of vanity and superficiality. Then, what we educators have created is nothing more than some "little foreign slaves"! There is nothing more harmful to the country and the people than this!</p>
<p>Confucius said: "Correct yourself before you correct others!" I hope that those educators will all lead by example, because children's ability to imitate is very strong. One who stays near vermilion gets stained red, and one who stays near ink gets stained black. The future of domestic goods is truly based on this!</p>
<p>Contributing Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e252">Two Small Suggestions <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Xuanwan</p>
<p>In this year of promoting domestic goods, we have indeed sung loudly and earnestly discussed the issue of how to promote domestic goods and resist imported goods. If we could all diligently follow through, then we might say that we have reached a considerable stage. However, on the other hand, we must also turn around and look at our own domestic goods factories – how is the progress in manufacturing? Has there been a reasonable increase in productivity? Has it been possible to achieve a considerable reduction in costs? What about improvements in products and lower prices?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that now is the most critical transition period for our country's domestic goods industry. "The sleeping lion of the East has awakened!" The revitalization of the domestic goods industry is the prelude to its roar. Looking at the nationwide high tide of promoting domestic goods with one voice, the rapid progress of our domestic goods factories, striving for excellence, regarding the past external promotion and advertising propaganda, are necessary conditions for our budding new industries, then how to improve production, reduce costs, make products beautiful, adapt supply and demand, and promote industrial and commercial prosperity and rural revitalization, naturally is especially the most important goal. Now I have the following two issues, to seek practical solutions, and contribute some opinions:</p>
<p>1.  Raw materials: Because our country is a country with backward production, raw materials are extremely scarce. The use of foreign raw materials by domestic goods factories has always been an undeniable fact. Now, to concretely solve this problem, we must try our best to use domestic raw materials. For those that already exist, we will vigorously promote them, and for those that do not exist, we will find ways to start them. Within a certain period, there should be a clear decrease in the importation of foreign raw materials. And this is also the way to relieve unemployed workers and peasants and revive the countryside.</p>
<p>2.  Organization: The development of an enterprise naturally requires the perfection of internal organization. The business and manufacturing departments of domestic goods factories must first cooperate and collaborate. For example, taking an enamel factory as an example, its products include several major categories such as washbasins, cups, rice bowls, food baskets, and kerosene stoves. And under each category, there are still dozens of different colors and patterns. Therefore, in terms of sales, the relationship of timing, the so-called supply and demand distribution, all require strict statistics. A certain type of goods may be selling well right now, but a certain type of goods must have its style improved… issues like these must be addressed by establishing a Business Liaison Committee, composed of personnel from the business and manufacturing departments, or a special Business Investigation Department should be established to investigate the market situation, sales information, and intelligence in detail. Otherwise, if business and manufacturing are often isolated, it is possible that a certain product is waiting to be sold, but the warehouse is out of stock, or a certain product's sales are temporarily stagnant, but a large amount of goods are shipped out and accumulated, and other contradictory possibilities may occur. In the previous issue, Mr. Yang Yao talked about Mr. Xi Guansheng's high talent and great ability in managing mooncakes, which is naturally enough for us to follow.</p>
<p>In short, the domestic goods industry, which is expected by all, is still in its infancy. It is like a baby in swaddling clothes, still requiring the nanny to dutifully maintain it. If it waits until its own body is healthy, the masses support it, and "the roots are strong and the branches are flourishing," then its future will naturally be limitless!</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Cartoons</p>
<h3 id="e253">"Uphold the King and Expel the Barbarians" (國貨漫畫) <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is an old licentiate from the Qing Dynasty. His aged appearance vividly portrays a kind and benevolent face. Because Mr. Wang has the appearance of a moralistic gentleman, people say that his thinking is outdated, calling him a pedant. Mr. Wang also gladly considers himself a pedant, without feeling offended by people's insults or expressing any resentment.</p>
<p>One day, Mr. Wang gave a speech about promoting domestic goods to the students. The opening statement was: "Uphold the King and Expel the Barbarians." The students were all stunned by the teacher, suspecting that Mr. Wang had inserted the nonsensical phrase "Uphold the King and Expel the Barbarians" into the middle of his speech about promoting domestic goods. Isn't this somewhat contrary to the current revolutionary trend? Isn't this 18th-century thinking? The students were at a loss, all looking at the teacher.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, after Mr. Wang's explanation, they finally understood that what Mr. Wang meant by upholding the king was upholding the king of domestic goods; what he meant by expelling the barbarians was resisting foreign goods. Only then did the students suddenly realize the truth.</p>
<p>Since this news spread to society, those who previously mistakenly thought that Mr. Wang's mind was dull have now changed their previous attitude of humiliation and contempt to one of respect and admiration. And from then on, everyone considered Mr. Wang to be a person whose thoughts were rooted in the old but whose thinking was new, not a complete old fossil.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Inventing Paper Made from Rice Straw <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Yin</p>
<p>In society, with the needs of the times, the utility of paper has become increasingly important. Among them, newspapers are the most important. According to customs statistics, the annual import of newsprint from abroad is no less than 30 million taels of customs silver. The great amount of leakage is increasing. In recent years, both the government and the public have been making great efforts to promote self-manufacturing. However, although newspapers have a wide range of uses, their value is very low. If there is no raw material with abundant production and low manufacturing costs, failures are inevitable. The raw material for newspapers in Western countries is made of wood, because they have many forests. Therefore, Chinese people often consider using other raw materials with relatively high yields to replace wood pulp. Because our country lacks forests and felling is not easy, recently, Du Shihua, the director of the Meili Paper Mill in Hangzhou, invented the manufacture of paper from rice straw. However, rice straw has always been used to make straw paper and cardboard and has no other use. Even if it is used to make paper, it is difficult to bleach and difficult to process due to its rough texture. Now, after Mr. Du's successful steaming experiment, it is indeed satisfactory. Although the paper produced is not as smooth as ordinary newspaper paper, it can be printed on both sides and will not bleed ink. As for the cost, it is one-third lower than wood pulp, about only 100 yuan per ton of pure white grass pulp. From this point of view, rice straw has become a raw material for newsprint. It is reported that Mr. Du is now preparing a large-scale factory to engage in production to meet social needs and has submitted an application to the provincial government to be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for approval to grant a ten-year patent, which will recover a lot of rights and interests for the future of domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e255">One Who Has a Mind <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>(1) Preface</p>
<p>Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it. Newton thought of gravity from seeing apples, and Franklin understood electricity from flying a kite, which are examples. The achievements of many domestic goods inventors are not necessarily certain from the beginning. If readers do not believe it, there are real stories to prove it.</p>
<p>(2) Apprentice who invented the electric fan</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Jichuan, the apprentice of a cloth shop who invented the Huasheng electric fan, has not only achieved personal success but also has a valuable place in the history of domestic goods in China. It is said that Western electric fans have been hit hard, and Huasheng electric fans have even been sold abroad!</p>
<p>(3) Hu Xiyuan becomes a monk halfway</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Xiyuan, the owner of Yapu'er, did not start out in the light bulb industry. However, Yapu'er's own light bulb business failed, but when Hu Xiyuan came out, he achieved success and carried it forward, relying on a person who has a mind.</p>
<p>(4) The beginning of China's heavy industry</p>
<p>Wu Yun first said: "Now the mission of Tianchu is not only to engage in chemical light industry, I am determined to start engaging in the promotion of heavy industry."</p>
<p>(5) The development history of Sanyou</p>
<p>Sanyou Industrial Society originally made candle wicks in a small house at the intersection of North Sichuan Road. If it had not gone through a period of hard work, how could it have been resented by a certain country's ronin, and the Triangle brand became popular at home and abroad!</p>
<p>(6) The transformation of fried dough sticks can expand the grand plan</p>
<p>Boss Xi of Wanshengyuan said: "If you transform fried dough sticks so that they can be packed in brocade boxes for gift-giving, then you can make a lot of profit and greatly expand your grand plan!"</p>
<p>(7) The success of Tianxu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Diexian of the Family Industry Society was still struggling on the lakes in the early years of the Republic of China. Later, he went from being a traveling secretary to making a living by writing and selling articles until he achieved success. This happened over more than 20 years. (Yu Zhicheng)</p>
<p>Visiting Notes</p>
<h3 id="e256">Notes on Visiting the Shengsheng Ranch <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Chunquan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shengsheng Ranch, located at the intersection of Daxilu and Columbia Road, was initiated by Mr. Shen Jiucheng, the founder of the Sanyou Industrial Society. It has been in operation for four years. The equipment is clean, and the latest steam disinfection and cold air sterilization machines are used. The scale is large, the reputation is growing, and the number of customers is increasing. The reporter was very happy to see the actual situation of the ranch. Yesterday, I received an invitation from Mr. Guang and drove by car to the China Vocational Education Society to visit with gentlemen such as Yao Huiquan, He Qingjian, Pan Yangyao, and Yang Chonggao. The following is a record of Mr. Shen's speech and the general situation of the ranch:</p>
<p>(A) Mr. Shen's speech</p>
<p>The fresh milk business in Shanghai, including the large and small ranches run by foreigners, has an annual value of 3.6 million yuan. Among them, the ranches run by Chinese people have a total annual value of 1.2 million yuan, which is only one-third of the city's business. In addition to fresh milk, there are also two types of canned condensed milk and milk powder. According to the comparison, condensed milk and milk powder are easier to use, carry, and store, and the price is cheaper than fresh milk, so many people use them. In the whole of Shanghai, the total annual value of the three items of fresh milk, condensed milk, and milk powder is 33.6 million yuan, which is quite alarming. Mr. Shen saw that most of the milk business in Shanghai was in the hands of foreigners, and the rights and interests were overflowing, so he was determined to improve it. Mr. Shen's ambition was fully sympathized by his colleagues.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen said that to improve the milk business, we must first pay attention to raising cattle. Some advocate raising foreign breeds of cattle, and some advocate raising Chinese breeds of cattle. According to Mr. Shen's opinion, it is better to raise Chinese breeds of cattle. There are three reasons for this: (1) Chinese breeds of cattle, one cow, can collect 8 pounds of milk per day, which can be increased to 12 pounds after the first mating, and then 20 or more pounds. Now, it is planned to raise 100 proven cows and 10 bulls in the areas of Chuansha, Liuhe, and Danyang. After 17 years, the number will be reproduced to 700 heads. By analogy, after 20 years, the 23.6 million yuan of milk rights and interests in Shanghai can be entirely in the hands of Chinese people. (2) Raising Chinese breeds of cattle in more than three or five thousand heads. According to the Shanghai Concession regulations, each shed can raise 80 heads of cattle. With 5,000 heads, 625 sheds are needed. Where can such a large ranch come from? Even if there is, it cannot afford the burden. It should be raised in the city and part in the countryside. If it is raised in the countryside, the sales of milk will be more difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate between the countryside and the city, which will be of great benefit to the Chinese countryside. (3) The price of ordinary Chinese cattle is about 600 yuan per head, which is cheaper than foreign cattle. Now, if a Chinese cow produces 8 pounds of milk per day, each pound is calculated at 30 cents, and the capital can be repaid in more than seven months. In addition, the production of calves is an extra benefit, so it is beneficial to be raised separately by individual farmers or raised in a ranch.</p>
<p>To sum up, we should know that Chinese people should raise Chinese breeds of cattle, but to raise a large number of dairy cattle, capital must be sufficient, and management must be excellent. Therefore, the five aspects of ranch, bank, cooperative, technician, and veterinarian should cooperate to achieve great success.</p>
<p>(B) General situation of the ranch</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Hygiene Department considers the A-brand fresh milk to be the best. Currently, only four Chinese ranches have obtained this license: Shengsheng Ranch, Freedom Farm, Xuzhi Company, and Huade Farm. Each ranch produces about 2,000 pounds of milk per day. Now, Shengsheng Ranch has (1) a machine disinfection room. All items related to filling milk in this room must first be disinfected by scientific methods. (2) a high-pressure steam disinfection room. The milk is placed in a disinfection pot and high-pressure steam is passed in to eliminate all dirt. (3) a low-pressure disinfection room. The milk is placed in a low-pressure disinfection. The temperature is generally 145 degrees, and after 35 minutes, there is no need to use high temperature to disinfect, so there is not much change in the inherent components of milk. (4) milking shed. This is specially made and must be inspected by the Hygiene Department. (5) ranch is spacious and comfortable. (6) a cold air engine room, with careful layout. The ranch milks three times a day. The milkers disinfect their hands in advance. If the dairy cow is about to urinate or defecate during milking, another worker will pay attention and clean it up immediately, so that the milk will not be soiled at all. According to the regulations of the Municipal Council's Hygiene Department, the A-brand milk contains up to 30,000 bacteria, but after actual inspection, the milk from each farm contains only three or four hundred bacteria, which can make those who drink disinfected milk take it with peace of mind.</p>
<p>After the visit, Mr. Shen Jiucheng gave each person a bottle of fresh milk to taste on the spot, and everyone was very satisfied. Then, everyone immediately decided to order it and promote the quality. According to Mr. Shen, fresh milk should not be cooked in a metal pot. It is best to use a water bowl, fill it with warm water, put the milk bottle in it, heat it slightly, and drink it. It is the most hygienic. It should not be cooked too hot in a metal pot, which will lose its nutritional components. Those with weak bodies at home must drink domestic sterilized milk regularly, one to nourish their personal bodies, and one to recover national rights and interests. It is a win-win situation. Happy to record it.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e257">The Decline of Signboards <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>The role of a signboard is like the clothing of a store, it has a sense of the times; in this era when the big wheel of time is moving forward, fashion is changing with each passing day, but there are also many signboards that are declining.</p>
<p>Why did the "Manchu Han Imperial Feast" in the restaurant have to be changed to "Great Han Imperial Feast"? Isn't this a manifestation of the success of the Xinhai Revolution?</p>
<p>After the opening of Shanghai, Guanghuo stores were transformed into foreign goods stores. The signboard was selling Eastern and Western goods. From urban areas to rural towns, they have done their best, presiding over the work of blood transfusion for many years. However, since the May Fourth Movement, under the pressure of public anger, everyone had to change their signboards, making the joke of Sino-Western goods.</p>
<p>Department stores can be said to be all-encompassing, and "managing global goods" is even more grand and imposing. However, in the year of domestic goods, this signboard will inevitably decline, I dare to guarantee.</p>
<p>Now, domestic goods companies have replaced department stores, and department stores have also added domestic goods markets or domestic goods shopping malls. Although the intention is to promote them, domestic goods are not despised by people, which is enough to prove it.</p>
<p>However, this has not yet completed the mission of the domestic goods movement! In any case, we have to smash the signboard of "managing global goods" so that there are only domestic goods stores in this society, not department stores!</p>

<p>▲ Poor Loom</p>
<p>Old Man Zhang is one of the richest people in the village. Unfortunately, he has worked hard all his life and only has three daughters, without any sons. Those with thin mouths often chant "The royal family is originally a tile kiln." Fortunately, Old Man Zhang believes that men and women are equal and have the same right to inherit under the laws of the Republic of China, so he doesn't take it to heart.</p>
<p>Old Man Zhang's wife is also a scheming person. Seeing that her daughters were growing up and would always marry, she wove a few pieces of homespun cloth early and late to use as wedding dresses. After the eldest daughter got married, she also prepared to weave for the second and third daughters.</p>
<p>The autumn weather is cool, and the wedding day is coming soon. Old Man Zhang's eldest daughter is getting married. However, the eldest lady said to her mother: The cloth woven from soil is rough and ugly. How can I walk in front of people wearing it? I want to cut some foreign cloth to avoid being laughed at for being rustic.</p>
<p>Her mother agreed with this and said: Foreign cloth is cheap, and the colors and patterns are good-looking. You don't have to weave it yourself in the future! So she ordered the long-term worker to chop down the loom and burn it as firewood.</p>
<p>When the loom was chopped down, it seemed to be crying wuwuwu. At this time, Old Man Zhang had just returned from the teahouse. Seeing this scene, he felt both sad and angry, so he scolded his wife: I, Zhang, have today's position, all thanks to a loom and a hoe. What I eat and wear doesn't cost money to buy. Now that the loom has been chopped down, half of the family property has been spent by you! After saying that, he stroked the loom and cried bitterly.</p>
<p>At this time, the eldest lady and her mother also regretted it and cried together. It was a room full of joy, turned into a day of dark clouds, who taught you to be fascinated by foreign cloth and chop down this loyal servant-like loom!</p>

<p>— Xu Jiao Gong</p>
<p>Joy and excitement filled Ying's heart, and she felt very satisfied as she gazed at the new dress just sent from the tailor shop in the mirror. Her slippery eyes were glued to this light green cheongsam, from top to bottom, and then from bottom to top. She looked left and right, feeling that the pattern of this cheongsam was novel, the color was bright, the style was new, and it made her delicate waist even more graceful, shining on her apple-colored face especially white and delicate. In her self-satisfied mirror, she felt like a fairy in the sky, an angel in the world.</p>
<p>She seemed to want to show off her beauty and expect others' praise, uncontrollably leaping from the bedroom to the outside as if stepping on a Charleston dance, humming a lullaby on her lips. When she walked into the living room, she caught a glimpse of her cousin Ming chatting with her mother, which made her even more excited because she could show off the beauty of her new dress.</p>
<p>"Oh, Brother Ming, when did you come?" she asked him like this, while paying attention to how he would exclaim at the sight of her new dress.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ying, not long…" He turned around and his eyes met Ying's brand-new cheongsam, and his words suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>This was an unexpected disappointment to her. Not only did he not praise her, but there was clearly some anger on his face. At this time, all the hopes in her heart disappeared. She felt his strangeness and was unprovokedly despised and ridiculed by him. She felt as if she had suffered a great humiliation, and all her happiness turned into a belly full of boredom. She turned around and ran back to her bedroom in one breath, and annoyance and resentment pierced her fragile heart.</p>
<p>XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX</p>
<p>Ying now understood her mistake, she woke up and regretted her recklessness. Experience told her that she must carefully consider the source of the clothing materials when buying them. Now she knew that she had been deceived by unscrupulous merchants and had become a cold-blooded animal that people condemned. She now not only did not hate him but was grateful to him, because he pointed out her mistake. She solemnly held his letter in detail and repeatedly read it, especially this paragraph in his letter:</p>
<p>…Even if you hate me very much, I will try my best to advise you, this is what my conscience urges me to do!</p>
<p>I never thought you would become so numb, decadent, and heading towards that land of no return, fighting against your own conscience and wearing enemy goods without shame! Have you forgotten the suffering you suffered in the past?</p>
<p>At the time of the Songhu Battle, you fled from your broken home to Shanghai in a panic. At that time, how indignant you were at the enemy's ferocity, how you beat your chest and stamped your feet, scolding the enemy's cruelty, clenching your fists and vowing to break off all relations with the enemy forever and never use enemy goods. Have you really forgotten these things?</p>
<p>Although the war has stopped, the enemy's ambitions are still high, you should know this, right?</p>
<p>In this period when the voice of promoting domestic goods is as high as the clouds, can we still not use domestic goods as much as possible?…</p>

<h3 id="e261">Not About Age <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Fang</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Tang Tao's "What Youth Needs," I was deeply moved and wanted to say a few words as well.</p>
<p>In the past, during the "May Fourth" era, those who "criticized" young people for needing "more and newer styles, powerful stimulation" seemed to be only the older generation. However, even the old-fashioned elderly at that time did not say that young people "needed to lie." But now, the young Mr. Kang Sihua is also "criticizing" young people. Furthermore, he believes that young people need to "lie." For this statement to come from within the youth themselves naturally carries even more "weight"! And there must be more than just one young Mr. Kang who holds this view.</p>
<p>This is one point where "now" differs from the "May Fourth" era. Back then, the phrase "conflict between father and son" was sufficient. In "now," the reasons for conflict cannot be rigidly sought based on age. Aren't there some young people today who are quite "mature and prudent," while some who are past their youth are very fiery?</p>
<p>The problem lies in what Mr. Kang calls "the need to lie."</p>
<p>Mr. Kang seems to think that he doesn't need to lie, nor does he need more new styles. But when we open our eyes and look, aren't new styles emerging endlessly? And aren't the methods of lying becoming more sophisticated day by day? In this atmosphere, is it that only those who turn a deaf ear and a blind eye, like Mr. Kang, can be said not to need to lie? Naturally, what Mr. Kang criticizes is not the "more new styles" I am talking about here, but precisely because he is like this, he has become someone who truly needs to lie. And what Mr. Kang criticizes as "more new styles" is exactly the "lying" he is criticizing.</p>
<p>In "now," those who do not need to lie inevitably have some "fire," even if they have not "criticized" "calm, profound, erudite speech and attitudes." It's indeed true that they don't love to read much. This is actually not about the "youth" or "old age" based on age. Just look at how the young Mr. Kang has already "testified by example"!</p>
<h3 id="e262">Pu Nuo A and the Nobel Prize <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>The other day, I heard that this year's Nobel Prize was awarded to the author of "The Gentleman from San Francisco," Pu Ning. Yesterday, I watched the film "The Siren of the Atlantide," based on the novel by French Academy member Pu Nuo A (Pierre Benoit). These two events inadvertently connected in my mind.</p>
<p>I wanted to read "The Siren of the Atlantide" when I was a student, but I never managed to. Academician Pu Nuo A had traveled to the Orient and even lectured at the Hochi Shimbun's auditorium, it seems. But I never had the chance to admire his academician's brilliance. Teacher Enberkerlot was a French Catholic monk, and he highly praised this academician, calling him the modern Alexandre Dumas. I don't like Alexandre Dumas, not because he was the mixed-race child of a French man and a black woman. I really didn't enjoy reading his swashbuckling novels. It's because they weren't artistic enough. Looking back now, I'm afraid it's because he lacked progressiveness. Because I didn't like Alexandre Dumas, I also disliked Academician Pu Nuo A. Even so, I still wanted to catch a glimpse of him from time to time.</p>
<p>This time, Pu Nuo A's great work "The Siren of the Atlantide" actually made it to the silver screen. And the people of this semi-colonial land also had the good fortune to behold it. Moreover, the author Pu Nuo A was elected as an academician of the French Academy three years ago. When a person becomes important, their writing is always worth money. So, I had to take another look at him. And recently, someone introduced him by saying that "The Siren of the Atlantide" is full of "poetry." "Seeing is believing." So, yesterday, I went to see it.</p>
<p>The desert scenery is indeed captivating. Beautiful as it is, behind that beauty, it feels like there's a sharp blade stabbing my heart. This current "Alexandre Dumas," in "The Siren of the Atlantide," clearly reveals himself as a lackey of imperialism. He is like Psichari and Louis Bertrand. In his novel "The Siren of the Atlantide," isn't Pu Nuo A loudly praising France's aggression towards its African colonies? This may be the main reason why he was elected as an academician. His fantasy created that "Siren of the Atlantide," but in the end, he revealed his fox tail. What he makes us feel is only sharp blades.</p>
<p>It is said that in the French Academy, only the old man Anatole France was someone. To use the words of our "country bumpkins," only he "was worth his salt." This was a long, long time ago. It is said that Anatole France only visited the Academy once, during his inauguration, and never stepped foot in that "Hall of Refinement" again. After Anatole France's death, the French Academy naturally became homogeneous. It is inevitable that people like Pu Nuo A would be elected as academicians.</p>
<p>However, no matter what, Pu Nuo A "maintains the old style." He is the current Alexandre Dumas.</p>
<p>Today (Monday, the 13th), Mr. Zhili wrote the following passage in "Free Talk":</p>
<p>"This year's Nobel Prize, it is said, went to the Russian writer Pu Ning. And it is said: 'Born in 1870, he is a recent Russian novelist, skilled in short stories. He does not adopt the new trends of Russian literature and maintains the old style.'"</p>
<p>Based on the above passage, it can be inferred that next year's Nobel Prize should be awarded to the author of "The Siren of the Atlantide." Because Pu Nuo A maintains the style of Alexandre Dumas.</p>
<p>What I am doing here is making a "prediction." At the same time, I am making a proposal to the Nobel Prize management personnel in the capacity of a "prophet." But will the words of someone from a semi-colonial land count? Probably, people from semi-colonial lands have neither the qualification to propose nor to receive the award. Don't we also have "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple"?</p>
<h3 id="e263">Scenery of the Big Courtyard <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Nong</p>
<p>From the window of my residence, I look down on a big courtyard. The southwest sides are the back walls of other alleys, and the east side is right under the window of my residence. A row of single-story houses facing south stands there. The open space in front is only about two or three zhang square. In the center, there is also a short, non-multi-story house. This is the area of the big courtyard. That row of single-story houses is divided into three rooms, and at least six families live in each room. The short house in the center also houses at least four families. There are so few houses and so many people. It's truly a wonder they can live there.</p>
<p>As soon as day breaks, the jazz music of the big courtyard begins, a loud and hurried ensemble. That's the sound of washing chamber pots. With a dozen or twenty chamber pots being washed, and even clam shells placed inside, what kind of sound do you think would prevent me from "rising at dawn"?</p>
<p>After the "jazz music" stops, women scolding husbands, mothers hitting sons, children quarreling… the sound film begins again. Do you think I can still write articles calmly?</p>
<p>Unable to bear the disturbance every day, I simply stand in front of the window to appreciate this beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>In front of the short house, a frame is built with large bamboo poles, and small bamboo poles are hung on the frame from the corridor railing of the middle house to dry clothes. Those must be the clothes of some auntie. Squeezed not dry, water is dripping. Some sister-in-law below starts to scold. And so, the two of them, without any sense of shame, begin to curse each other loudly.</p>
<p>There is a well in front of the first house. A dozen or twenty families rely on this well for eating, washing vegetables, and washing clothes. Some girl, with two braids hanging down and wearing a checkered cloth cheongsam, is drawing water. Some auntie standing next to her scolds her for being so slow, making people's legs ache. The girl doesn't give in, and the two of them also start cursing each other.</p>
<p>Buzzing in the sky, airplanes, airplanes, everyone closes their mouths, stops working, and stretches their necks to look at the sky. A little girl of eight or nine years old is holding the neighbor auntie's baby, watching the airplanes. Without warning, she trips over a stone, and the little girl and the baby fall to the ground. The baby cries loudly, and the little girl is so scared that her face turns as white as paper. The neighbor auntie rushes over and picks up the baby, repeatedly saying, "Good baby, don't be afraid." The baby's crying stops, and the little girl, now frightened, starts to cry out loud.</p>
<p>Big Sister Ma, with disheveled hair, is waiting for someone at the door. A woman wearing a tattered serge cheongsam enters this big courtyard from outside, constantly looking back. She walks as if hiding military supplies on her body, her frightened expression showing on her thin face. Strange, I only see her approaching Big Sister Ma, taking out a small piece of paper from the long stockings on her legs, and stuffing it into Big Sister Ma's hand along with some copper coins. Without a word, they nod to each other and separate. Big Sister, that girl with the big eyes, is standing at the entrance as a lookout. They are doing secret work for betting on flower arrangements. Then, several men and women all make contact with Big Sister Ma in the same secretive way. The girl who has the piece of paper stating the name of the flower arrangement she is betting on takes it out from her permed hair. The secret work is done with utter magic.</p>
<p>The sounds of cursing, loud shouts, quarrels, and children crying never stop broadcasting for a second.</p>
<p>In front of the short house, an old woman and an old man with white hair put down two spinning wheels and start spinning yarn, buzzing. This is a stringed violin duet, which is more peaceful and melodious than the morning brass "jazz music."</p>
<p>However, the "jazz music" is my prelude to "rising at dawn," while this violin duet has become the lullaby for my entire writing time.</p>
<p>However, on Sundays, the "Wild Rose" of the big courtyard returns. In the "violin duet," you can hear her clear singing voice, and the big courtyard is beautified.</p>
<p>This "Wild Rose" is the daughter of a family living in the middle house, about sixteen or seventeen years old. She has a slender figure, a pretty face, likes to wear a cheongsam made of dark blue calico, has permed hair, and wears sneakers. She is a female student studying at some school. She goes home every Saturday afternoon, and on Sundays, she often sings loudly, sometimes singing popular tunes, and sometimes singing songs taught at school. Her voice is crisp and round, probably a song and dance star at the school. She sings sometimes in the upstairs room, and sometimes she runs to the well and sings while dancing.</p>
<p>"Wild Rose," or maybe she's called "Wild Cat," she also often quarrels with the neighbor's girls. When she quarrels, how fierce she is. Look at how her eyes are narrowed and her lips are moving non-stop. However, as soon as she ignores people's mouths, she starts singing, such a moving singing voice.</p>
<p>"Wild Rose's" brother works as an informant in the police station. He leaves the house every morning when the "jazz music" is playing, a big guy, with a helmet, and black cloth pants, often reminding me of the informants I have encountered before, and evoking past memories.</p>

<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>For a long time, he had been lamenting his poor health, feeling heavy, and often experiencing inexplicable discomfort. The doctor said again:</p>
<p>"Because the bullets from a pistol can pass by your side, but the wine must enter your stomach."</p>
<p>"So what if it enters my stomach?"</p>
<p>"Then it burns your stomach, disrupts your nervous system, stagnates the blood, and makes you prone to strokes. People with your constitution are all at risk of stroke."</p>
<p>The increasing intoxication of the retired jeweler dissipated like a wisp of smoke in the wind: he looked at his son with an uneasy and fixed gaze, wanting to know if he was joking.</p>
<p>But Bao Ru cried out:</p>
<p>"Ah! These doctors, they are always the same: telling you not to overeat, not to drink alcohol, not to fool around with women, not to dance the polka. All of this is harmful to the body. Well! I do everything, all over the world, enjoying myself as much as possible, and my body is not doing so badly..."</p>
<p>Bi'er replied sternly:</p>
<p>"First of all, you are stronger than my father; and everyone who loves to have fun says the same thing until one day... and the next day they won't come back to tell the cautious doctor: 'Doctor, what you said before was right.' When I see my father doing something that is worst and most dangerous for him, it is only natural for me to forewarn him. Otherwise, I would be a bad son."</p>
<p>Feeling bored, Mother Roland came out to intervene:</p>
<p>"Enough, Bi'er, what's wrong with you? Just this once, it won't do him any harm. Think about how happy he is today, how happy we are. You'll completely spoil his fun and make me feel uncomfortable at home. Your behavior is too much!"</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and murmured:</p>
<p>"He can do whatever he wants. I've already forewarned him."</p>
<p>But Father Roland stopped drinking. He looked at his glass, the glass filled with luminous wine, many small bubbles rapidly and quickly rising from the bottom of the glass and disappearing on the surface, as if the soul of this intoxicating wine was flying away; like a fox discovering a dead chicken, smelling a trap, he looked at his wine glass with suspicion.</p>
<p>He asked hesitantly:</p>
<p>"Do you think this is very harmful to me?"</p>
<p>Bi'er felt a kind of remorse, feeling that he shouldn't have troubled others because of his own bad mood.</p>
<p>"It's okay, once in a while, it's nothing, you can drink, but don't drink too much, and don't make it a habit."</p>
<p>So Father Roland picked up the glass, but still couldn't decide to bring it to his mouth. He stared at it painfully, wanting to drink and fearing it; then he smelled it, tasted it, drank it in small sips, savoring it carefully, while his heart was filled with bitterness, cowardice, and gluttony, and when he drank the last drop, he was filled with regret.</p>
<p>Bi'er suddenly met Mrs. Lu's gaze; that clear gaze rested on him, appearing discerning and stern. Bi'er felt, understood, and guessed the thoughts contained in this gaze, the thoughts of this simple and honest little woman's indignation, because this gaze seemed to say: "You're jealous, you. That's shameful."</p>

<h3 id="e266">Talking in Circles <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Cun Ren</p>
<p>In my student days, I was frank and outspoken, often offending others. One of my teachers taught me: "With this kind of temperament, when you go out into society, you will definitely run into walls everywhere, it's extremely dangerous. Your attitude towards people should be peaceful, never boast about your strengths, and never discuss other people's shortcomings."</p>
<p>"Teacher, I didn't say anything bad about others."</p>
<p>"Speaking without considering the other person's interests, arguing without leaving them any room, this is the same as talking about their bad points, or even more so, because it makes it impossible for them to save face. Speaking in a way that makes it impossible for someone to save face, that kind of attitude is not good."</p>
<p>But despite receiving instruction, my personality was already formed, mountains can be moved, but personality cannot be changed. I still often had a bad attitude when talking to people. The teacher sighed and said: "This child cannot be taught!"</p>
<p>After leaving school and entering society, the teacher's prediction came true, and I ran into walls everywhere. The reason for running into walls was my frankness, even to the point of offending good friends.</p>
<p>After hitting a wall, I sought advice from a worldly elder, a fellow villager. The elder said: "Having sharp corners, being inexperienced in the world, being hot-blooded, and lacking cultivation, you will naturally gain enlightenment from these subtle things after hitting the wall a few more times."</p>
<p>A few more years passed, white hair had grown, my beard had lengthened, and although I had hit the wall many times, my attitude towards people was still not good. I asked the worldly elder again. The elder said: "You've hit the wall so many times, and you still haven't gained enlightenment?"</p>
<p>"I understand a little. At first, I can still pretend, but after talking for a long time, my attitude still turns bad."</p>
<p>"Being able to pretend to talk to people, this child is already teachable. Can't you keep up the pretense all the time? Just be careful and cautious, never speak wildly, and you'll be halfway there."</p>
<p>"However, I would like to hear your teachings."</p>
<p>"For example, when exchanging pleasantries with someone, you shouldn't immediately blurt out about the hot or cold weather. Just say: 'The weather today, hahaha...' If that person says, 'The weather today is really cold,' then you can say, 'Yes, it's really cold.' That way, you won't offend anyone. Maintaining this policy of talking in circles, your speech will naturally be impeccable, and no matter how long you talk to them, your attitude will never turn bad."</p>
<p>However, this policy of talking in circles is not for me. I simply can't force a fake smile, and I still have a bad attitude towards people everywhere, and I still hit the wall.</p>
<p>Alas, how difficult, this policy of talking in circles. This life is over, but I hope that when I am reborn as a son in the next life, I will know how to talk in circles.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Remembering the Past <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>It was two years ago.</p>
<p>At school, I was such a fool, disliking socializing, and even not really wanting to talk to people much. But I was often wrongly dragged into student council-like organizations to play a supporting role. In this kind of situation, the usual students are most uninhibited. They can brazenly run to the Western Palace and Eastern Palace to flirt and show off, or at least act as a tourist in the corridors there, circling around for no reason. If it attracts rumors of flirting, there's plenty of room for explanation. You're not going to collect student council dues, but you can say you're urging the school beauty to perform at the talent show, or you can say you're fundraising for "anti-Japanese" or "disaster relief." If so, let the rumors fly, and let your "cha-cha-cha" leather shoe sound (patent leather shoes may be even more fashionable) progress your mission under the oiled hair and chest-out primping.</p>
<p>I was really too foolish, as if poisoned by the idea that "women are trouble," and even though I sometimes had strange thoughts, I always looked down on female classmates. This may be because of my own many flaws, always wearing the same set of tattered long gowns from start to end of the year, and having a yellow-black complexion. I often felt that people like me were bound to be ridiculed by them, and it seemed to be true. Whenever I ran into them, I always felt that they were laughing at me.</p>
<p>It could be said that the clerk in the teaching affairs office was deliberately teasing me. This semester, he put me at the same table with a female classmate named ×. At first, I was a little angry, but I could only swallow it privately, and then I sat down at the same table with her calmly.</p>
<p>Although she wasn't the school beauty or princess, she had an equal reputation. A pair of sharp eyes, a torrential-sounding cherry mouth, and an easygoing attitude were some of her fundamental beauties, and the pure wine that fascinated quite a few students.</p>
<p>Since we sat at the same table, in order to avoid being entangled, I always arrived five minutes late, secretly dodging the teacher's gaze and slipping into the classroom. After class, my feet would rush out of the classroom as soon as the bell rang.</p>
<p>That way, we were at peace, and the classmates couldn't find any reason to spread rumors about me, but instead, they laughed at me as the king of fools, because quite a few students were suffering from not having the opportunity to get close to her.</p>
<p>Not long after, I discovered a secret about her, which was that every time I went to class, I always saw her tearing up her own notepad to wipe the dust off my desk. I thought in surprise: "Ah, women, this may be a characteristic of women!"</p>
<p>After that, it was every time I took the dirty things back, and even praised them a few times without reason. Knowing that she would not look at these useless things, if I didn't bring them back and asked her for them, she would always say to bring them next lesson. When I couldn't wait any longer, I had to say a thirteen-point reliable sentence: "Miss ×, please bring them back next lesson no matter what!" She didn't bring them back next lesson, so I asked her again, and she said: "Why don't you come with me to get them later!" So I strolled into their boudoir, she was so polite and dragged out many sweets. In that situation, I seemed to feel that the house was spinning, and all I could see was the swaying of the flower circles.</p>
<p>The term exam was approaching, and she said vaguely that she had no confidence, meaning that she wanted me to give her a hand. The term exam was approaching, and I happened to be suffering from a severe cold with a cough. When she found out, she immediately bought me a bottle of "Almond Dew" to cure it, and at the same time, under her "charming smile," she stuffed some of her essay topics and papers under my pillow.

<h3 id="e268">Investigation <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>After being sick for three days, a urgent letter from my hometown compelled me to get out of bed. Looking in the mirror while combing my hair, I couldn't believe that only three days of illness could make me look like I had been sick for three months. My chin formed an almost equilateral angle, showing that the illness had eroded the flesh of my cheeks. My nearsighted eyes seemed to sink deeper into their sockets, and my complexion was as pale as a green vegetable. However, an important matter from my hometown awaited my completion within two days.</p>
<p>Although it was between autumn and winter, today seemed particularly warm. Wei wore a lined cheongsam, but after climbing the stairs several times, she had already changed into a single layer shirt. I knew that the climate in the countryside was colder than in Shanghai, and I might have to stay there for a few days. Three days of illness had already brought significant changes. To protect my fragile health, I wasn't afraid of Wei laughing at me, so I put on a thick camel hair robe and also brought an overcoat. Looking at myself in the mirror, I looked too much like a opium-smoking consumptive ghost.</p>
<p>As the rickshaw pulled up to the train station, I saw on the clock tower that there were only five minutes left before departure. I hurriedly paid the fare, buried my head deep in the collar of my overcoat, and quickened my pace to climb the stone steps. I didn't notice a large man blocking my way. He was an investigator, naturally with a policeman behind him with a gun hanging from his waist. I immediately stopped, held out my hands, and let him pat me up and down, left and right.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Perhaps it was because I was wearing so many clothes that his fingertips weren't sensitive enough to detect some small objects, so he couldn't find what he was looking for. Or perhaps there was some professional reason that he ordered me to open my coat? This was certainly within his official rights. If you wanted to board the train, you couldn't resist. Moreover, in Shanghai, even if you were sitting safely at home, you might encounter this kind of sudden surprise. However, I knew that I was completely innocent, and the train was about to leave in five minutes. The next passenger train would be in the afternoon, which would affect my important business in the countryside. I couldn't help but feign ignorance out of anger and asked, "Investigate what?"</p>
<p>"Suspicious items!" If I were to use an inappropriate analogy to describe this response, it would be as frightening as a bullet flying in from outside the window during the Shanghai battle.</p>
<p>Forgive me for not knowing if wearing a camel hair robe on a sunny autumn day was against the law? He searched every pocket, a wallet, a paper package, and he examined them as solemnly as if he was inspecting military maps. Finally, my socks and the inner layers of my garters were exposed in full view of everyone (I couldn't blame the surrounding crowd, because it seemed like a very worthwhile spectacle to watch). Luckily, I had gotten out of bed this morning, and my old, worn socks had already been given to the maid. Despite this solemn inspection, the train driver didn't know that such a thing had happened outside the station, and the train slowly started to move.</p>
<p>In the end, he didn't check the inner layer of my pants or the big red birthmark on my back. I'm sure he didn't see it, otherwise he would have screamed loudly, because my grandmother said that when I was born with the red birthmark on my back, the midwife was also shocked, which shows how startling this red birthmark is. Although he had the skills of an investigator, he certainly didn't have the midwife's experience in recognizing red birthmarks. I didn't hear him scream or see him jump, which proved that he didn't discover my red birthmark.</p>
<p>The train had already left. I put on my clothes and could only call the rickshaw back. He didn't seem satisfied yet and remembered my hat. Unexpectedly, he found my old office's name card inside the brim. He glanced at me and said in a voice ten million times softer than a bullet, "Sorry!"</p>
<p>Not to mention the friends who came to watch the show were dumbfounded, even I, the person playing the role, was somewhat stunned. Did a name card from such a small organization have such an amazing effect?</p>
<p>"If I had known, I would have put the box of name cards in a brocade box and kept it with me every day." Sitting in the rickshaw, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>When I got home, I told Wei about the inspection. I asked her where I showed obvious clues of suspicious items.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's because you've been sick for three days?" my wife said humorously.</p>
<p>I smiled and looked in the mirror at my reflection that looked like I had been sick for three months.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Returning After Chrysanthemum Viewing <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Xu</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Fourth Chrysanthemum Exhibition was held at the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road. After taking the time to appreciate it once, I couldn't help but have some thoughts:</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums have always been praised for "grasping fragrance in their later years." Since Mr. Tao Yuanming retired to the forest because he was "out of step with the times," and enjoyed himself with chrysanthemums, comparing chrysanthemums to gentlemen, after such vigorous "promotion," the value of chrysanthemums became extraordinarily high. Therefore, regardless of elegance or vulgarity, people would always find a few pots of chrysanthemums to play with in the autumn.</p>
<p>The art of chrysanthemum cultivation has been improving day by day. Things that people couldn't have dreamed of in the past, such as a single chrysanthemum plant being able to bloom in two or several colors and shapes, and the flowers in a pot of chrysanthemums being able to bloom in the same size and height, can now be cultivated artificially using scientific methods, which is not surprising at all.</p>
<p>Judging the names of chrysanthemums based on their shape, such as: goose yellow, crab claw, etc., now seems extremely unsophisticated. It is necessary to give them very elegant names to appear different and surpass all other flowers, for example: red and white interspersed are called "Evenly Dividing Autumn Colors," and many small ones surrounding a large one are called "Stars Surrounding the Moon," and so on.</p>
<p>The chrysanthemums I saw this time were indeed not bad, especially the products of Jinan University and Xiaoguan Garden were particularly beautiful. Originally, this "Chrysanthemum Exhibition" was a collection of the crystallization of many people's hard work, so it was certainly not an easy task. However, after reading, admiring, and viewing it, I felt that the artificial carving was too severe, completely losing the natural and simple spirit, and only being demonically beautiful. If we were to compare it to women, then these are all young women who are about to lose their youth, and are all flamboyant beauties who have experienced the vicissitudes of life; beauty is certainly extremely beautiful, but she has already lost her innocence and her purity.</p>
<p>Perhaps my view is a bit too extreme, but I have another idea:</p>
<p>Aren't the several pots of "Juan Ying" and "Jin Mao" in Xiaoguan Garden raised on high-legged mahogany shelves? Anyone who has seen them should have a deep impression. The trunks are short, but they hang down from above, halfway down the flower stand, covered with small flowers, yellow like golden stars, white like silver light. In the chrysanthemum array, they are like cranes among chickens, with a great momentum to look down on others. However, in the countryside, by the bamboo fence, by the river bank, they also grow in the soil, but they don't have exquisite flower pots, beautiful mahogany flower stands, and no one pays attention to them: they just let the dirt stain their faces, and let cattle and sheep trample on their bodies. Even if someone appreciates them, it is just the little girls in the village who pick them and put them in their hair, but they are discarded by the roadside in less than a day. In this situation, those who are fortunate are certainly fortunate, and can jump onto the mahogany shelf and look down on their peers: but how many are destined to be buried in the grass for life!</p>
<p>The "Chrysanthemum Exhibition" is on the third floor of the Continental Emporium, and the "Chrysanthemum Market" is on the fourth floor. The "Chrysanthemum Market" has been open for many days, and many of the chrysanthemums are certainly not as good as the products of the "Chrysanthemum Exhibition," which are the crystallization of many people's hard work. In particular, placing these beautiful flowers under the dry, three-dimensional building makes them appear even more vulgar. Even the "Chrysanthemum Exhibition" still couldn't avoid this "problem," although the walls were hung with calligraphy and paintings by famous artists, which everyone regarded as the height of elegance.</p>
<p>Originally, "no matter how good the peony is, it all depends on the support of the green leaves." A luminous pearl will lose its luster when thrown on a pile of cow dung. How can things in the world be different? I remember seeing the Chrysanthemum Exhibition at Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing at this time last year. In the lake and mountains, there were red flowers and white flowers, and most of the chrysanthemums were planted in the soil. The natural atmosphere was thriving, which was much more interesting.</p>

<p>— Xin</p>
<p>丨Don't Rob Your Own People!丨</p>
<p>The basketball hoop was broken and couldn't be played with, so we temporarily changed our strategy and played "Captain Ball." Captain Ball is played like this: divide the whole team into two groups, A and B, and draw a line in the middle of the field. On both sides of the middle line, draw three circles of equal size, and place one person inside and outside each circle, so a total of twelve people are needed. In the field, there are Centers who can freely run and throw the ball, two each for groups A and B, for a total of four people, so a total of sixteen people are needed to play this game. I was elected as the referee. Before we started playing, I mobilized everyone like this: "Although we are on the playground, everything must still be done with discipline; those who injure someone intentionally or unintentionally should know that this is a friendly match! What we must remember is that we must not rob our own people."</p>
<p>So, the waves of struggle were easily stirred up; then, the two sides competed fiercely. At this time, in addition to the sound of the ball hitting, all that could be heard on the playground was a chorus of "Don't rob your own people!" "Don't rob your own people!" Ah! When I heard this sound, I felt a great surge of emotion in my heart! This faint sound of "Don't rob your own people" is a pity to only be heard on the playground. If it could be broadcast to those bastards who specialize in "robbing their own people," they would be ashamed to death!………</p>

<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>The sun at the end of September was still terribly hot. After being exposed to it for a long time, my skin felt itchy, as if caterpillars or mosquitoes were biting me. Fortunately, the leaves had not yet fallen completely, shielding a lot of the sunlight, and the gentle autumn breeze brought a chill to soothe it, so we didn't feel too hot. Instead, we felt warm all over, which was quite pleasant.</p>
<p>"Fifth Sister, why do women have to sleep with men to have children? I still don't quite understand, can you explain it again!" I repeated the central question between us.</p>
<p>"Don't pretend to be stupid on purpose, don't you understand? I don't believe it!" What followed was a coquettish smile.</p>
<p>"Really, otherwise why would I ask you!" I said it myself, but I didn't believe there was any truth in my words, so my cheeks immediately turned red.</p>
<p>Fifth Sister brushed her thumb across my cheek and said, "How shy!" I felt even more uneasy; however, I was secretly excited, which was a natural physiological phenomenon. Then Fifth Sister embraced me in her arms, so we leaned against each other face to face, our bodies pressed very close. I felt as if I was drunk, feeling an unprecedented sense of elation.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sky darkened, and the autumn thunder sounded gloomy, like beating a cowhide drum. The bushes behind the big maple tree rustled loudly. We were startled and hurried home. Mother was already puzzled that the basket was empty; and when she saw that my lips had turned blue, my cheeks were clearly different, and I was trembling all over, she knew that I was frightened, and quickly made three passes over my forehead with Yang fire, while questioning, "What happened? You're so scared. It doesn't matter that you didn't collect pine needles, tell me quickly!" I didn't answer, but just forcefully burrowed into Mother's arms, and a question arose in my mind: "Mom said that if you do something bad that can't be told, the thunder god will strike you. Is it true?" But I didn't dare to ask Mother.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>That was because Mr. Du's usual flattery skills were superb. The newly arrived county magistrate was actually an old acquaintance of Mr. Du, so Mr. Du took advantage of the rice-cutting holiday in June to hurry to the county seat. It was said that before he set off, in order to buy some more fashionable clothes, he had no money, so he sacrificed his life to sell the green seedlings of thirteen mu of grain to Master Li, exchanging them for twenty silver dollars. Then he used the money to make clothes worth twelve yuan, two sets of fashionable white bamboo cloth undershirt and pants, and a piece of homemade summer cloth long gown. Naturally, it wasn't the famous Liuyang summer cloth. It took Mrs. Du a lot of time to bleach it to make it relatively white; but it still couldn't get rid of its earthy smell and muddy taste.</p>
<p>Mrs. Du was somewhat dissatisfied with Mr. Du's grand gesture: "Selling the green seedlings to find a job, what if you find one? If you don't, then we'll be starving in the second half of the year, it's a disaster!" "This can be considered taking a great risk in the world!" Mrs. Du is, after all, Mrs. Du, influenced by Teacher Du, and her words are more sophisticated than those of ordinary village women, very concise: and naturally somewhat in line with modern logic.</p>
