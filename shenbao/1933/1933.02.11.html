<h3>對質問兩要點國聯靜待日本解答</h3>
<p>日内閣召集緊急會議愼重考慮</p>
<p>九人會繼續起草工作擬具建議</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日中日問題似不致有何發展、因軍縮會主幹部現亟欲進行其工作、今晚未必及早休會、致而使九人小組會有復開會議之時間也、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）起草委員會擬於星期一日將其所繕關於滿洲爭議之報告書、提交十九特委會全體會議、以便下星期國聯大會開會討論之、（十日路透電（</p>
<p>（日内瓦）九人起草委會今晚會議、對解决中爭議前途任何可能的方案之法律點及專門點、從各方面詳細討論之、各委員對此咸覺如在國聯記錄上創一先例、則各委本身責任極爲重大、故均主愼重考慮、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本之新提案、據日本方面所稱已是該國最後之建議、今日十九國委員會之秘密辯論會曾加以討論、據平常極可靠方面之傳述、會議中對於日本之承認李頓報告書中第十章所述之十點、頗表示滿意、但日本之解釋仍與委員會所明瞭者有重要不同之點、即如滿洲土地主權一節、據委員會所决定係應屬諸中國、而日本　反是、故委員會現已擬定一確定之問題、使日本解答該問題、即爲日本究竟能否在原則上承認中國在滿洲之主權、而將來之發展胥視乎日本解答之如何、若答文屬於、「否」字方而者、則急劇之衝突實不可避免之結果、而國聯勢必與日本破裂也、現聞幕後頗有人用言詞婉勸日本從速撤兵、弗再武力侵略中國、未知能否有效也、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>日内瓦將有驚人發展</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）此間現有驚人進展不久或將發生之感想、國聯已請日本明白切實答復滿洲現行制度不是解决法之理論、日代表松岡對於國聯之提出此問題、表示驚異蓋渠以爲日本立塲業已説明也、松岡現正在繕　中、而再請示於東京、日本代表團之其他人員亦與松岡同一意見、謂日本立塲已屢次向國聯説明、故明白答復「是」或「否」之請求、完全非必要、至於熱河問題、聞日方擬聲明其和平意思、而指中國軍隊爲擾亂原素、故將要求華軍之撤退、今時局之重心、集於日方、此後如何發展、將視日本對於今日重要問話之答語而定、</p>
<h3>預測日本必答否</h3>
<p>聞日本覆文在兩三日以前、未必發出、雖一般與情豫料日本覆文必爲否認性質、但有數方面相信日本將作最後努力、而不捨去調解地位也、調解失敗後之唯一辦法、厥爲國聯發表其認爲公允適當之報告與建議、但日本若令國聯根據盟約第十五條第四項而行動、則與日本有何利益、日本必熟慮之也</p>
<h3>兩條路任日採擇</h3>
<p>假定日本不與國聯完全决裂、則日本究以在第十五條第三項下、抑在第四項下爲有利乎、此乃現爲人討論之問題、在第三項下日本須接受十二月丨五日之决議案、而有對於理由説明書提出保留之權、再邀請美俄兩國參加一節亦可取銷、若在第四項下、則十二月十五日决議案之條欵行將加重、美俄兩國旣須邀請參加、而全盤地位亦將愈臻嚴重、</p>
<h3>退出將自陷孤立</h3>
<p>倘日本退出國聯、果如東京來訊所云、則日本將犧牲其在國聯中之有力地位、使中國獨佔陣地、並使列强遇有歐戰以　最擾人之難題、以上所述悉爲今夜　般人討論資料</p>
<h3>日與僞國難區别</h3>
<p>今晚九人小組會集會時、有委員數人言及小組會建議經濟抵制與撤回一滿洲國」領事之可能性若干人之心理由此可見、會塲中並有人以日本與一滿洲國之間無從區别爲言、雖大國代表未有承認潛能性者、但此問題現將入於前途茫茫之境、而種種不愉快之可能性、或將隨之發生、此固爲人所公認也、</p>
<h3>起草會最困難工作</h3>
<p>調解失敗後、勢須設立一種機關、代國聯行事、以監視建議案之實施、此種機關有何職權如何組織、負何責任、小組委員會　討論及之、小組會集議兩小時、未有切實解决而散、惟對此問題發表意見者、殊不乏人、小組會擬明日再議、如未有時間、則定星期六午前集會、事有可注意者、今日軍縮會開會兩小時、旋即停議、以便九人小組會得以及時開會、其重視中日間題、於此可見一斑、</p>
<h3>監視機關縝密討論</h3>
<p>小組會晚間七時半集議、其所討論者、幾　爲設立監視機關之問題、此事恐將爲起草委員會極難着手之　事、大約須提交十九特委會、請其予以指導也、此事最困難點集中於委員會資格問題、一般意見、似以爲委員會有無此權、須由行政院决定之、但此委員會之權限如何、前無　例以指導之、此亦爲人所共諒者、故若兩造允開談判、則此委員會之職權、究何在乎、委員會應與兩造會商乎、抑從旁視察乎、抑於必要時予以勸告乎、抑有權以命令形式佈告辦法乎、抑僅屬顧問性質乎、抑有公斷及解　國聯議案之權乎、如兩造不願開談判、則此委員會有權提出如經濟抵制或撤回領事等之計畫乎、小組會集議時、對此數點曾加以討論、而其所討論之見解、大都純爲推論性質、蓋以前無成例可資遵循、而各委員咸了解其决議之嚴重也、邀請美俄兩國加入一層、亦屬困難事件、因委員會邀請非會員國參加實質上之國聯機關、是否有　善的法律根據、抑委員會僅請非會員國以顧問資格出席、此皆可疑問者也、今夜有一種堅强感想、以爲日内瓦即將有驚人發展云、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>東京極度緊張</h3>
<p>日閣召開緊急會議</p>
<p>對國聯質問書</p>
<p>愼重考慮覆牒</p>
<p>急電松岡靜候回訓</p>
<p>（東京）日政府因國聯形勢愈益惡化、於今日下午一時在院内開緊急閣議、當時由内田外相報告國聯之經過後、協議該對策、惟日内瓦日本代表部絡繹有重要訓電抵京、故决定準備任何時均可開閣議、明日之紀元節、或將召開臨時閣議、（十日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日内閣在院内開臨時内閣會議、内田外長報告昨日國聯十九國委員會經過、謂松岡根據八日之訓電、對國聯提出新調解案、但十九國委員會不接受日案、反問日政府是否承認中國在滿洲之主權、須以文書明答、國聯明知日本已承認「滿洲國」爲獨立國家、受日皇批准、互相交換議定書、國聯此種態度、實欲使日本國策發生搖動、滿洲陷入不可收拾地步、故不能再退讓、關於答覆内容、與日本前途關係甚大、不能任代表酌量自答、由外交部擬定覆牒、電令松岡提出、聞各閣僚已决定一任内田外長善處今後局面、閣議後内田再召開部會、審議覆牒内容、聞日外部已預先電令松岡代表不得私自答覆國聯云、（十日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外部接到松岡報告後、今日開部會審議覆牒、内田外長·有田外次·谷亞細亞司長·及白鳥情報部長等均到、决定酌量軍部意見　擬定牒文電訓松岡提交國聯、部會後某司長代内田外長對日記者團談云、照昨日會議空氣估量、第三項之調解工作已告完結、十九國委員會或從此入第四項工作、第四項之勸告與第三項之調解比較、内容更不利於日本甚明、但雖以第四項勸告對付日本、亦不必立即退出國聯、退出問題視國聯動作能使我國策搖動與否而定、日本已承日皇勅許、正式承認「滿洲國」、此種事實、與政府責任甚重大、若國聯强欲抺削此事、則不容遲疑退出國聯、（十日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）昨日之十九國委員會僅舉日新提案中之愛昧文字、質問日本政府、求其明答、日外部竟認爲侮辱大國面子、詆燬日本之大陸政策太甚、遂接二連三開部會議、討論應付方法、據東報載稱、今日下午四時起至六時止、外交部司長會議、</p>
<p>結果、决定電命松岡洋右將所擬覆文草案送交外部、如與外部意見相差不遠、則加筆條改、否則從新擬稿、各司　報纸所傳之代表部覆文甚消極、取守勢解釋日本之主張、大勢如此、不如取積極進攻、從全面否認十九國之質問書、剖明日本國策、力倡調解失敗責任須由國聯擔負等、六時電命松岡將代表部之草案送交外交部、（丨日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據東報所傳、日外部覆牒内容共有三點、以日本立塲主張滿洲獨立爲解决一切中日紛爭之基本原則、其大綱如左、（一）滿洲獨立　出於三千萬華人之自動、根據民族自决之精神、日本爲獨立國家、承認其獨立、不受第三國之干涉、（二）滿洲　無組織無袟序之中國統治、不但三千萬民衆之不幸、中日紛爭永久不能解决、（三）無論受何壓迫、斷不能取消「滿洲國」、或變更對滿政策、聞日外部之覆文、在十三日以後發出、（十日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本代表團某負責發言人向報界發表宣言如下、「此際因日本有新讓步之故、調解程序即將告成、而十九國委員會乃認爲應當採取一種足以妨害全局之動議、日本政府自必爲之詫異蓋十九國委員會直至最後一分鐘、乃提出兩項問題、要求答覆、其一問題並須用書面答覆、此種難以索解之舉動、或係故弄狡獪、亦未可知、但十九國委員會中、多有明達之士、何以弄此顯而易見之狡獪、今姑置第二問題於不論、第一問題實亦不能成立、緣自數月以來、丨九國委員會及世界與論、業已瞭解東京政府對於滿洲之觀點、今乃要求吾人用書面承認中國在滿洲之主權、皮無異强令吾人放棄「滿滿洲國」之承認、而此「滿洲國」之存在、固吾人認爲遠東和平所不可少之條件、十九國委員會於明悉吾人堅定不移之志願以後、乃欲吾人否認原來政策、此非吾人所能了解、吾人本可立即答覆十九國委員會、并不必向本國政府請訓、但吾人寗願平心靜氣、起草覆文、並將覆文請示政府、以待其核准、頃有人欲以調解程序最後失敗之責、諉諸日本、吾人殊不願墮其術中實則十九國委員會如果堅持其態度、則調解程序之最後失敗、實將無可避免也云云、一般人以爲日本代表團答覆十九國委員會之文、在明日以前、未必即能提出、（十日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>德魯蒙晤松岡</h3>
<p>傳達特委會之質問</p>
<p>日軍侵熱行動</p>
<p>松岡仍稱自衛</p>
<p>（日内瓦）特魯蒙於今日下午四時與松岡洋右會見、傳達十九國委員會之質問、及日軍犯熱問題、日代表於下午五時半至六時二十分如開代表部會議、聞日方已决定拒絶十九國委員會之質問、並不請示日外部、定在明晨再開代表會議擬製成反對聲明書、其内容分爲三部、（一）反對十九國委員會之質問、（二）截止和協接洽理由、（三）根據會章十五條第五項之反對勸告聲明書等、（九日華聯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯秘書長德魯蒙今晨報告十九特委會、謂昨奉委託後、已往見日代表松岡、口頭請其注意於熱河附近之繼續的軍事準備、德魯蒙並將晤談經過情形一一詳述、但　僅　口頭、而非正式之討論、故特委會不能依此根據而有何行動、須俟接到日方正式覆文後、方可定奪也、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會接獲消息謂、日本繼續作軍事準備、並出以軍事行動、認爲足使局勢愈趨嚴重、有使調解努力歸於無交之虞、乃委託德魯蒙秘書長口頭向日本代表團提出交涉、促其注意、今日午後日本代表松岡洋右往晤德魯蒙、向之作答、謂日本所爲、僅係對於中國當局之企圖、加以自衛、至十九國委員會所提出是否承認中國在滿洲之主權一問題、松岡洋右謂將用書面答復、據日本方面消息、此項答復當作否定之語、似此十九國委員會立即引用盟約第十五條第四欵、自屬當然、以故草委員會自今晚起、即從事起草建議、以便列入提交大會之報告書中、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日靑年外交官與軍閥竟沆瀣一氣</h3>
<p>狂呼撤回辱國外交</p>
<p>力主立即退出國聯</p>
<p>（東京）日外部每臨危機、必數出恫嚇宣傳、謂將退出國聯其實國内經濟空虚、不堪孤立、更不堪擴大軍事、故累次受重臣元老及財界牽制、至今仍與國聯敷衍、部内靑年外交官甚表示不滿意、今</p>
<p>次接到國聯質問書、乘機開始活動、與軍部靑年軍官勾結、欲藉檢桿力量脅迫外交部退出國聯、聞今日軍外兩部之强硬主義者來往甚密、密商進行方法、其將來之推移甚堪注目、（十日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省内之少壯派、對於十九國委員會之提出質問書、謂完全無視日本對李頓報告書之意見書與新提案、蹂躪日本承認「滿洲國」之根本策、不可默然置之云、與軍部方面之少壯派相呼應、强硬主張撤回辱國外交、及立即退出國聯等之、斷運動、故外務首腦部亦重大視之云、（十日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）十九特委會請日本對於「滿洲國」之承認予以明白確切之答覆一舉、已引起日本外務省之　懣、今日外務省發言人聲稱、國聯對於日本對「滿洲國」之態度、佯作不能了解、此直爲有意侮辱日本、日本對此根本問題、無讓步之可能、因日本確信「滿洲國」之存在、爲遠東和平所必要也、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>外交衝突不免日證券市狂跌</h3>
<p>大阪　日本最後妥協案、昨日已在十九國委員會審議、日經濟界對國聯前途抱絶大關心、尤其昨日中午日陸軍省發表侵熱聲明書以後、經濟界揣測、以爲日本與國聯正面衝突在所不免、因之惹起股市大形跌落、如以代表股票市價表示其實情、則舊股跌八角、新股跌一元六角、（十日華聯社電）</p>
<h3>日人造謠</h3>
<p>謂陳友仁在巴黎</p>
<p>與俄締軍事同盟</p>
<p>中俄雙方力闢其妄</p>
<p>（東京）日本政府發言人今日又大造謠言、謂接非正式消息、陳友仁日前在巴黎時、曾在蘇俄駐法大使　討論締結中俄攻守同盟條約之議、（十日國民社電）</p>
<p>今日日政府發言人發出奇異消息後、國民新聞社記者即造訪刻在上海之陳友仁氏、告以此説、據稱日人到處見鬼、此説絶對不確、完全無稽云、</p>
<p>（莫斯科）此間對於東京所傳陳友仁曾在巴黎俄大使署接洽攻守同盟之説、業已正式否認、消息靈通者稱、日人甫於一星斯前揑造中俄商約之説、當經此間否認、今又作無稽之談、無異火上加薪、益增蘇俄之煩懣耳、此種不幸事件陸續發生、將使莫斯科起最不愉快之印象云、</p>
<p>（十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日此間處於半官地位之俄人聲稱、東京所傳陳友仁曾在巴黎俄大使署討論中俄締結攻守同盟之説、絶無根據、</p>
<p>中國出席國聯總代表新任駐俄大使　惠慶亦鄭重聲明、陳友仁目卜在中國國民政府中、並朱居何官職、而陳氏友人亦謂陳氏在歐　雖曾至巴黎、但彼爲現政府之反對派、即令有此提議、亦祇能作私人提議、須待陳氏柄政後、方能成熟、日人之言絶對可疑云云、</p>
<p>按陳氏已於上月十一日自意返國、（十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）自東京大放陳友仁曾在俄大使署討論軍事同盟謠言後、此間中俄兩使署即　謠、不僅加以否認、並痛斥日人之專　造謠、指出陳友仁業已數月未至法國、據中國公使署發言人聲稱、中國使署從未有署員至蘇俄大使署、亦未奉政府訓令與蘇俄接洽任何條約云、又蘇俄大使署發言人聲稱、觀於此説來源、即可證明其出於假造、此種條約直接違反蘇俄外交政策、俄政府政策祇求訂結友好與不侵犯條約、而拒絶一切軍事同盟、（十日國民社電）</p>

<p>英政府故特提出具體建議、以作會議之試金石、艾氏繼述及海軍軍縮問題、謂迄今各海軍國所討論者、僅屬消極性質、又稱英政府擬不遺餘力而成一</p>
<h3>基本協約</h3>
<p>云、第二演説者爲德代表那杜爾尼、謂德政府歡迎便利軍縮會議工作之一切建議、惟足以延長軍縮談判之任何計劃、皆所反對、那氏繼乃批評軍縮會議應從速結束、而對於有實效的軍縮　層不必商得同意之建議、那氏對英國之提案、表示歡迎、又謂各國</p>

<h3>羅氏訓話</h3>
<p>羅氏偕郭院長、於十一時五十分、抵北浙江路第一特區地方法院、在院長室、召集江蘇高等法院第二分院長沈家　、刑庭長郁華、民庭長李棟、第一特區地方法院長郭雲觀、及民庭長李　、刑庭長錢鴻業、等訓話、對於改良司法改良監獄諄諄告誡、達五十餘分鐘、至十二時半始散、</p>

<h3>昨晚返京</h3>
<p>羅氏昨午赴各法院長杏花樓歡宴、上海市長吳鐡城亦被邀陪座、羅氏即於昨晚乘十一時夜車回京、</p>
<h3>羅氏談話</h3>
<p>昨日據羅部長於接見各報社記者之時、談及關於司法上之過去弊病、及今後改革之意見、羅氏首謂、特區法院之不滿人意、外人在報端批評甚多、其所藉口者、大致有如下各點、（一）執行太遲、（二）上訴權太濫、（三）普通執行手續太繁、（四）商事習慣不大明瞭等、然余自長司法部以來、覺得此種情形、不獨上海一區爲然、統觀全國、亦均未必自認爲滿意、蓋中國法律、自一九零二年馬關條約以後、勵行法治、但完全採取大陸一派、偏重於理想者居多、對於事實方面、是否切合、未有深究、而在滬外僑、大陸僑民固多、英美實居多數、英美法律、較爲簡捷、在英美僑民視之、自更未能滿意也、但此種法律、行之歐洲、亦無甚不合、蓋其設設周密、如偵察法·登記法·破産法·等、均足以補救其弊病、中國設備未週、而效法他人、是猶見他人於嚴冬之際、在逸園跳舞廳跳舞、蟬衣半裸、飄飄欲仙、而我則在未有此種設備之時、逕效其法、不但不足以言快樂、且可以致病而有餘、故無論何事、若僅穿一身西裝、便以爲已學得他人妙法、實不如冬裘夏葛之宜也、惟余在北京政府時代、亦曾與王寵惠先生訂定刑法等法制、其時大多偏重於科學方面、當時亦曾自視爲滿意、但自余坐監獄一年以後、於此一年中所得之經騐、覺過去制定之法律、轉覺紕謬百出、無一是處、以是知理想與經騐、相差甚鉅、從而知　國古法、未嘗無古法之長處、祇須根據事實、便有好成績、譬如昔重人治、而殺人者往往能挺身償命、不失英雄氣槪、今重法治、而人民巨多玩法輕義、故本人以爲有柏油路方可駛汽車、爛泥地上駛汽車、反致陷阻、無法行駛、并覺齊之以刑、固不若道之以政之爲愈也、</p>
<h3>改革法制</h3>
<p>羅氏對於最近之法制上之缺點、及犯人在監獄牢之痛苦等處、表示因本人曾經被監禁年餘、對於此項情形、　多經歷、故此次派次長鄭天錫等、分赴華南北全國各地考察、俟收集彼等考察報告後、當與本人觀察所得、彙集成文、請立法院予以改革、</p>
<h3>希望收回</h3>
<p>羅氏對此次滬特區法院協定之滿期而未能達到修改之目的、表示甚爲痛苦、同時認爲批評執行遲緩等手續上亦確有應研究之必要、并希望在此時、積極努力、俾下次協定滿期時、不致延期、而得達到收回目的、至公共租界内監獄管理權之收回、羅氏謂此時尙難辦到、</p>
<h3>撤特别法</h3>
<p>羅氏最後答記者問、謂關於危害民國緊急治罪法之取銷問題、今春曾有人提議、將一切特别法取銷、其中關於鴉片者已取銷、基餘諸法、則中政會未能通過云、（新聲社）</p>

<h3>社會局公佈滬戰工廠損失</h3>

<p>去歲一二八之後、全滬工廠所受直接間接損失、迭經市社會局一再調查、至今始明確、計工廠八百九十六家、損失總額爲五千三百零七萬九千一百九十五元八角六分、市社會局特於昨日公佈詳細損失經過、茲錄如下、</p>
<h3>公布意羲</h3>
<p>本市工廠林立、爲全國工業中心去年一二八之後、日人侵佔閘北江灣吳淞等區、肆意轟炸、戰爭狀態、綿歷四月之久、戰區工廠、摧殘殆盡、其他區域之工廠亦遭受巨大之損失、其總數達五千餘萬元之鉅、茲爲便利世人之參考計、於發表本市工廠損失統計之前、先將本項統計之編製情形、略陳梗槪於下、</p>
<h3>材料來源</h3>
<p>戰事發生後、社會局會同市商會·會計師公會·舉辦戰事損失登記、製印登記表、通告本市公司商號工廠　團住户等、分别依式塡報、本項統計、大部分係根據該項登記表、惟登記表中工廠一項、共列九百六十五家、事後詳加整理、發現其中有若干家、依「工廠」之普通意義、不得認爲工廠、編製本項統計時、不得不將此項材料剔去、經　整理後、本市工廠塡具登記表　報告損失者、祇有六百八丨四家、然此次戰事歷時頗久、全市工廠、莫不遭受直接或間接之損失、而自向登記處塡表報告者、僅及全市工廠廠數三分之一、本局爲力求準確計、遂於事後詳加覆查、然限於時力、此項覆查工作、祇以戰區工廠爲限、覆查時、由本局派員分赴戰區、調查現有工廠廠夥遇有尙未塡報戰事損失之工廠、即分發登記表、囑其依式補塡、再將現有工廠、與本局前年調查所得之工廠名錄對照、俾可確知全部被燬之工廠廠數、全部被燬之工廠中、查有尚未塡報損失者、則設法覓得廠主住址、查詢損失確數、然其中有一百六十四家工廠、其廠主於工廠被燬後、流轉四方無法查詢、此一百六十四家工廠、　能參照本局舊有紀錄、根據該廠資本多寡産品種類營業狀况等、佔計其損失總數、</p>
<h3>準確程度</h3>

<h3>黃乃樞談增加南洋郵資</h3>
<p>現寄國外信件仍收半價</p>
<p>所增不多僑胞無甚影響</p>
<p>郵政總局年來受東北郵權被攫及銀價低落之影響、不敷至鉅、局長黃乃樞　此艱鉅、對於開源節流、規對不遺餘力、最近提議改正南洋羣島、與閩廣間郵資辦法、外間不明眞相、頗多訛傳、中央社記者特往訪黃局長叩詢一切、茲分錄於次、</p>
<h3>從前情形</h3>
<p>黃局長談、南洋羣島我僑民集居甚衆、信件往還及銀錢匯寄、甚爲繁忙、故在汕頭厦門等處、有民局批局設置、以便利僑民所收郵費亦至優、其投寄方法、係照整包重量付費、十六年起、除馬來及南洋羣島外、美屬菲　濱、荷屬東印度、法屬安南等處郵局、要求依照國際郵聯公約改革、均已先後實行、取銷整包投寄辦法、</p>
<h3>優待條例</h3>
<p>至民國十八年、英屬新加坡亦有同樣要求、我郵局方面、因碍於郵聯公約、未便反對、但當時華僑直接與星洲郵局交涉、乃有優待辦法之决定、時我國國外郵件、每封重二十公分、收費一角、優待半價、僅收五分、而新加坡發出之信件、則收該處幣制新幣六分、實行至今、未稍變更、</p>
<h3>三次加價</h3>
<p>三年以來、銀價慘落我國郵局、因外匯關係、損失至鉅、故三次加價、由一角角半二角而至今日之二角五分、本歲又以東北郵局之被擢、收入减少、虧蝕不資、倘長此以往、我國郵政勢將破産、故有改正新加坡郵件收費之議、郵政司長林實據請後、即親往僑委會洽商、以期早日進行、</p>
<h3>仍收半價</h3>
<p>現在國外信件、每封收費一角五分、對該處郵件則仍收五分、僅五分之一、値此金價暴漲、郵政困難之時、不加改正、實難應付、故擬加至一角二分半、雖已增加、但仍爲半價、况華僑匯銀信件等、每月最多一次、亦有數月始有一次、所增之負担、爲數有限、而金價高漲、胞僑收入、亦比例增加、對此小數負担、當無影響、但在郵局方面、集腋成裘、每年收入當可稍資彌補、希望各界認明事實云、</p>

<h3>廢兩改元辦法銀錢兩業表示贊成</h3>
<p>廢兩改元、財政部已决定三月一日實行新幣重量成色、銀元銀兩折合法定價目、均已規定、新聲社記者、昨在訪銀錢兩業領袖、據談、國家欲謀統一幣制、必須廢兩改元、今財部規定之新幣重量成色、以民國　年國幣條例爲原則、况初實行時、准許銀元銀兩並用、規定折合法定價目將來實行時、預料不致有何困難、故頗爲贊成、且實行後、各業往來均用銀元、手續上簡省不少云、</p>

<h3>兩輪互撞後雙方今日查騐</h3>
<p>被難家屬决將提出交涉</p>
<p>太古公司寗波輪、中威公司太平輪、於前午在董家渡浦面互揰、殃及民船、溺斃船員搭客後、昨兩公司互相交涉、定今日察騐、被難家屬、將提交涉、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<h3>雙方交涉</h3>
<p>中威公司得太平輪船主報告後、昨日上午、即致函太古公司、譯意、略云、本公司太平輪、於二月九日上午十一時四十分、被貴公司寗波輪撞壞、并殃及民船、溺斃人命、現請明日上午派員　騐、太平輪停泊在周浦中華碼頭、至於損壞民船溺斃人命、應由貴公司負責賠償等語、太古公司得寗波輪船主報告後、亦於昨日上午、致函中威公司、</p>
<p>譯意、略謂、一九三三年二月九日上午十一時四十分、在董家波船塢相進、本公司寗波輪、與貴公司太平輪相撞、現寗波輪已進江南船塢修理、請於今日下午四時、派員前往查騐等語、</p>
<h3>今日查騐</h3>
<p>昨日、中威公司接太古公司函時、不及派員前往查騐、當即將經過情形、呈報江海關理船廳·航政局·航業公會、并决定今日上午、兩公司會同公證人察騐師、分别查騐兩輪撞壞狀况、及研究互撞責任問題、新聲社記者、昨晤兩公司負責人、據中威方面表示、認爲寗波輪行錯航線、經該輪拉汽笛通知、仍無回音、以致肇禍、應由太古負全責、太古公司方面表示、認爲寗波輪已先停船抛錨、本平輪不應再行前進、互相推諉、究竟誰是誰非、須待查騐决定、</p>
<h3>水巡報告</h3>
<p>市公安局水巡隊、昨發表關於太平寗波兩輪互撞案經過云、昨晨上午十一時許、據報、三泰碼頭浦面發生輪船互撞、當派隊長　　·張克峯·水警王學德·陸根生·李修　·馳往調查、并予救護、寗波輪係出口、太平輪係進口、兩輪互撞結果、太平輪向西岸斜駛、以致停泊在旁之　沙船舢舨船石子船等、均遭波及、或損或　、又方由會館碼頭開駛之航船一隻、被撞分兩段、全船搭客船員、均落水、當即救起沈關喜一名、腰部受傷、帶隊後、即送入上海醫院、</p>
<h3>損失詳情</h3>
<p>由會館碼頭開駛至龍華南蕩口對面五冲涇地方之航船照會爲市六六八八號、船老大爲王玉根、載重約四百担、每一搭客、收費僅銅元十五枚、當日來回、是日載搭客二十九人、船員三人、甫離岸、即被撞壞、船分二段、完全覆没、全船搭客船員均落水、經水巡隊救起沈關喜一名、已受傷、經救生局救起張阿王一名、當即斃命、餘均隨浪飄流、大沙船石子船計損壞楊萬林等船户十四隻舢舨船五只、航係　隻沉没、曁太平寗波兩輪各受微傷、損失總數、約六七萬元之譜、</p>
<h3>米業改用新量器後運費發生問題</h3>
<p>號方工方情詞各執</p>
<p>上海米業經營米糧買賣、向係海斛、十斗足石爲標準、乃海斛現時不合於用、改制新量器、每石比舊海斛减小　斗五升、爲八斗五升、已於本月一日實行、市上交易、均照新量器買賣、而駁運車運挑負等、因此近日發生糾紛、在出資者、以爲前此係照海斛、現在量器减小、其費亦應比例照减、在駁船車夫等、以按袋計算、不能</p>
<p>因貨量稍少而核减、現在米號方面、以南北兩市、每日所銷之米一萬餘石、皆係米號購進、照新器與舊器比較核計、每萬石相去一千五百石之多、車運等費、數不在少、每月統計、更屬可觀、若不照新量器計算核减、有失公平、受虧非細、誰能負擔、彼車夫等不明底藴、致起糾紛、應請米行領袖轉告車頭約束、並調解之云、</p>

<h3>改變職業問題　（一）</h3>
<p>丨鄔君來信丨</p>
<p>我是一個志行　弱和　　　乏的靑年、因爲要解决我的生活問題、當我十五歲的時候、便抛棄了我所　的　、離開我的家鄉、往那數千里一個鎭市的商店面爲學徒了！當然，我對於我的戰業，是抱着很大的希望的。我要由我的學徒生活上去奮鬥！我每日做一些灑掃的工作，這當然是我門靑年應吃的苦，我想從這些工作裏、去偷一點聞空的地方，學一點書寫和打點算盤的技能，這是商界必需的。然而　實印不容許你這樣的做去！現在三年徒弟生活是已終了，結果得到的代價，因負重物腰部受傷了，現在我想了一想，我是想學生意的一切學識，他爲什麽絲毫不許我呢？最不許我，那我不是没有職業麽？那我的光陰！豈不是冤枉斷送了麽？我的學問毫無，社會上究竟何處是我立足之處呢，我想仍然是照我這樣的學下去，就是學到老，豈不是依然故我麽？與其是這樣，我想不如早早的改業，我又没有其他事業的學識，我想茶役我可以做得，每月倒還可以得一點薪水，可以養家，特來請先生指導，以爲我這個辦法好麽？</p>
<p>答：舊時的學徒没有什麽學得，除了給店主人及高級職員做奴隸以外，這是普遍的情形。至於書寫和算盤的技能·全靠學徒的自已「見眼生情，」巴結了一位管賬的先生或書啓先生，偷空兒請他敎敎，才有獲得一點技能的希望。若是你以爲你是學生意的，等着店主人或店中先生們自動地來敎你，那你算　錯轉了念頭·你吃虧或即在此。假使你爲的要馬上　幾文錢「養家，」打算改業做茶役·未始不可，假使茶役能比初出師的學徒多賺幾文的話。至於求學那就是另一問題。不過，茶役或許比學徒稍微逢由一點，可以偷點工夫讀書，也未可知，那就看你自已奮鬥的力量如何了。</p>

<h3>市敎育局局長潘公展講演「上海的敎育　（三）」</h3>
<p>學校敎育及社會敎育的槪况</p>
<p>（四）師範學校　本市近年以來、小學逐漸增多、師資很感缺乏、最缺少的是幼稚園和鄉村小學的敎師、故一九二九年　有私立幼稚師範之增設、一九三○年度有市立鄉村　範之創辦、總計一九三一丨一九二年度師範學校的數額、市立者一校、私立者八校、共計九校、所需經費爲一五五·八七九元、其中市立師範學校經費佔一四·四九五元、學生數爲一·二八六人、敎師爲一八七人、當然包含職員在内、其設備與中學校略同、不再分述、</p>
<p>（五）减　學校　本市職業學校、國立的只有國立同濟大學附設之機師學校、部立的有交通部立電信學校、私立的有私立中華職業中學、私立同德助産學校、私立中德助産學校、私立人和助産學校等、經費以中華職業學校爲最多、約七八·五八○元、茲將一九三一丨一九三二年度職業學校的統計報告於後、</p>
<p>校數　學生數　敎職員數　經費數</p>
<p>國立　一　五九　二九</p>
<p>部立　一　　六　二五　一八、○○○</p>
<p>省六　一　一一六　二五　　九、九六</p>
<p>私立立案　五　一、四八八　一四六　一七○、三八</p>
<p>私立未立案　二　九七　四五　四○、六七一</p>
<p>共計　二　一、七四六　二七○　二八八、九七五</p>
<p>（六）市高等敎育　高等敎育、是人才敎育如只有了小學中學而没有大學、那是對於一般國民、只有普通的訓練、公民的訓練、而缺乏人才的培養、領袖的培養、上海因爲有了三百五十萬的人口、所以小學不能不極力的擴充、小學旣擴充中學和師範又不得不盡　的推廣、但是爲國家培養人才、爲社會造就領袖、高等敎育當然也有同樣的發展、本市高等敎育、包括專科學校、　立學院、和大學校、雖然離我們的目的還很遠、却在全國各大都會中、比較的算進展尚快的了不過我們覺得上海大學和學院太多了、未免設科　系有些重複、實在是不經濟的事情、我們現在因爲時間限制、簡單的槪述如下、</p>
<p>（甲）專科學校　國立專科學校、在本市的、有一所、學生數共一二七人、敎職員數共二四人、經費約一二六三三九元、部立的專科學校、本市共有二所、學生共二三○人、敎職員共四九人、經費每年合共十六萬二千元、私立立案的專科學校、本市有一所、學生共一○二七人、敎職員數共一七八人、經費每年十萬餘元、</p>
<p>（乙）獨立學院　本市的國立獨立學院、共有三所、學生共二七一人、敎職員數共一三二人、經費每年三十九萬九千餘元、至於私立立案的獨立學院、共有四所、學生共二五三八人、敎職員共二一七人、每年經費合共三十六萬七千餘元、而私立未立案的、也有七所、學生共一六二三人、敎職員共一　九人、經費每年十七萬六千餘元、</p>
<p>（丙）大學校　本市國立大學、共有四所、學生共一七五二人、敎職員數共四三六人、經費每年合共一百四十一萬五千餘人、私立立案的大學、本市共有六所、學生共七一七人、敎職員共七○三人、經費合共每年一百六十四萬一千餘元、私立未立案的、共有三所、學生共六四二人、敎職員共一百六十三人、經費合共每年約六十萬五千元、</p>
<p>（七）市立理科實騐室　本市市立各小學校、限於經濟、對於自然科學上之設備、自然未能十分完備、但是中國這樣的物質上不發達、自然科學這樣的不普及、如果要提倡科學敎育、各校的科　的設備、當然要設法擴充、市敎育局因此特設市立理科實騐室、購買標本機器、使市立各小學校、學生部可以獲得試騐的機會、</p>
<p>以上把學校敎育説了一個大槪、現在再從社會敎育方面來説、</p>
<p>在這個都市之中、我們必須自已知道、對於社會敎育方面　努力、實在是要比學校敎育方面困難而艱辛得多、第一、社會敎育是多面的、不易使力量集中、第二、社會敎育是廣遍的、不易使力量普及、第三、社會敎育的反動力甚多、不易維持其　面的效率、第四、無形的不　當的社會勢力、因爲社會環境的複雜而到處在散播、不易使有規律的良好的社會敎育發生恒久的效果、</p>
<p>我們的努力、雖然未必能夠獲得我們理想中的成績、但無論如何、爲要使社會各方面都得到有規律的良好的社會敎育的分量、不論在積極方面或消極方面、都有相當的計劃與設備、自然我們不能不感覺到經濟的缺乏、人才的不夠、和計畫設備的不完全、不過、在可能範圍以内、應該做的必要的工作中、幾年以來、我們自信、已經有了相當的建設、</p>

<h3>阿答納模特兒游街</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>這則笑話眞　的厲害了：土耳其阿答納地方的女浴堂裏，爲着有人謠言坍屋，嚇得許多女浴客演了一幕模特兒游街的趣劇，　透電徧傳與環球各國知曉，這不但，滑天下之大稽，简直是笑天下之大話了。</p>
<p>記得，去年南京某浴堂裏失火，好像也曾演過一幕男性模特兒游街的趣劇、不過，這是局部的笑話，不曾有路透電徧傳與環球各國知曉，同是模特兒游街，爲什麽女姓游街，便有路透電徧傳與環球各國知曉的價値？這是一個很有趣味的問題，也許含有幾分人生哲學和社會心理在裏面呢？</p>
<p>造謠言者，是一個女浴客，伊騙得其他女浴客不及取了性的掩護東西而紛紛出奔，伊便老實不客氣的席捲衆人的衣服而逃，人人説伊惡作劇，我説：伊不是惡作劇，伊是環球各國笑的總動員的司令官！</p>
<p>土耳其式的沐浴，在上海是很時髦的，便在歐洲也有很悠久的歷史。去年，英國倫敦博物院長惠勤博士，曾因掘土考古的工作，發現了一千七百餘年前的羅馬帝國所有的浴室，有很完備的熱氣管通到圍牆裏面，一切室中的布置和土耳其式的浴室浴具差不多；這可見土耳其式沐浴歷史的悠久了。但是，在這一千七百餘年來很悠久的「浴史」裏面，要找出一幕同樣的女性模特兒游街，只怕不容易吧。</p>
<p>這是，千載難逢的趣劇，所以，有路透電徧傳與環球各國知曉的價値。</p>
<h3>地心吸力</h3>
<p>— 徐絜</p>
<p>從「量」的方面説來，人们最不平等：銀行老閭，成千成萬的花花綠綠鈔票印了出來，造洋房，坐汽車，討小老婆，頣指氣使，威風凛凛，撒一個屁，也有人恭維是香的。黃包車夫冒着風雪，鎭日地人拉了人，在馬路上跑腿，得不到一二角錢，也許給巡捕老爺賞賜了幾個巴掌，這是常有的事。還有小工們，爲了幾角錢工踐，要爬到十幾層的高樓頂上去；一不小心。跌下來做了肉漿，也是死而無冤。而建築師口講指劃，設計打樣，這些小工們的犧牲，似乎不在心上。至於文字勞工，絞了腦汁心血，成了神經衰弱的重病，最多每二天寫了四五千字，得着二三十元的酬金，究竟天天的寫了下去，生命　也是縮短下去。可是面團團的資本家，一個電話，或一句口説，十萬百萬，便可不勞而獲。從「量」上説來，人們難道是平等的麽？</p>
<p>現在人們，都相信恩斯坦的相對論，不相信奈端的地心吸力學説了。從社會的現狀説來，恩斯坦的相對論，自然佔了充分的勢力，其實，奈端地心吸力的學説，確是萬古　撲不破的眞理。譬如我們爲着衣食奔走的，奔波一世，聊免饑寒，這呌做「爬死。」不過他們豐衣足食的富翁，究竟也不過日度三餐，夜度一宿，雖然不必過「牛馬生活，」可以安安穏穏過「豬玀生活，」這呌做「等死；」和我們的結果，一般無二的呀。誰不知道陶朱，猗頓，鄧通，石崇，是個富翁，到了今日，那一個不爲地心吸力，吸入地中，一坏黃土，永爲長眠之人。唉！奈端的學説，可説是「最平等的公理」了。</p>
<h3>上海夜話揷圖「小男人」偉大</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>吃了晚飯，找朋友談天，消磨光陰，太嫌無聊。翻翻買而不看的大文豪作品，先要磨快了刀，才好邊裁邊讀，太嫌費事。伸懶腰，打呵欠，預備睡覺，又怕害不消化症，回頭吃萆蔴油。左也不行，右也不妥，於是决定方針，實行馬路巡禮，領略都市之夜的偉大精</p>
<p>奇怪，不到三分鐘，　客們已經又把花花綠綠的鈔票，舖滿了一棹子。如此慷慨成性，一擲千金，假使有人去　些救　捐，何愁没有希望。偉大呀，賭客的慷慨。</p>
<h3>川沙途中</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>市輪渡像一匹巨鰲，　着黑烟，剌開當前的黃沉沉的獨浪，努力地離開銅人碼頭，帶了我的心；向東岸箭似的射去。</p>
<p>水上的淸新的空氣，温暖的風，包圍了船身。靠在船舷上看銀色的波鱗，都市的巨厦，人類的奔馳，以及平野上紅色烟囱裏冒出來的烟煤；曉得世界是常在動蕩着，各種生命都在呼吸着。</p>
<p>綠樹和田作物充滿了春的微笑，人們被太陽光潤紅了雙頰在社會之羣裏歌唱，縱然是悲哀與苦痛的歌，然而這悲哀與苦痛，確是人生的珍寳，我决不肯放棄它。</p>
<p>馬上「慶寗寺」的紅牆就跳進眼裏了。離船登岸，趕緊搭輕便小火車，在磊磊落落的石子路的軌木上滾，向前滾，車和駱駝一樣，　着我們閒眺村野的風景：耕牛眠在草地上，白羊散在農田裏，小孩子們騎在狗背上，鵝鴨浮在水上·········。</p>
<p>到「暮紫穚」下車，換乘小漁船去訪一個朋友，櫓聲又入蘆花港，眼前橫一條深江，突然一個小艇飛過，艇上村姑們的紅的衫子，倒流入碧琉璃似的春水上，那樣鮮明，那樣美麗，然而又那樣快的逝去了。</p>
<p>在幽暗的街燈下，展望着人行道上，站滿着紅綾綠錦裏着的活動少女模型。</p>
<p>奇怪，這種妖冶嬌媚的姑娘們，據説，在上海人的目光中幻成了一尾一尾的「野雞。」據説，這種野雞是花柳病醫生的大恩人，因爲野雞會把花柳病種子，很神秘地在「打野雞者」的身上像農夫那們裁培成優良的果子，而使「打野雞者」自然而然地去照顧花柳醫生發財。照理説，身體髮膚，受之父母的「打野雞者」，當然不該把受之父母的身體髮膚，慷慨地給野雞試騐花柳種子栽培，但是，因活動少女模型的站滿着人行道，我證明了摩頂放踵，不惜犧牲的「打野雞者」的數量之多。偉大呀，「打野雞者」之精神。</p>
<p>我正在崇拜着「打野雞者」之精神的偉大，點頭播腦，感慨係之之際遇到了一位久遠的老友，跟他光光臨一家不太不小的「二百十七號」賭窟。我擠在賭客們的脅下，向檯上一望，只見花花綠綠的鈔票，放了一棹子。一陣呼盧喝雉像風捲殘雲，畫裝進了賭塲老　的口袋。好生　　繼着是沈默的孤村　片柏樹林裏悄悄地囀着無名鳥的啼聲，淸脆，宛囀。讓櫓聲休止，漁船飄旋在中流，太陽暖得很，風微微地吹，世界是那樣地恬靜。到川沙城，已是黃昏時候了。</p>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>照像</h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>「死了，不死怎麽會有這許多血呢；」</p>
<p>「不錯。這個傢伙準死啦············哈哈，你們還要狠麽；前一夜裏，你們厲害極了，今天怎麽啦············老子們不費一點兒力氣，不過用了一個小計策，就把你們全送到佬佬家去啦············哈哈，到了陰間遇着探路的義勇軍，再詳詳細細的告訴他們罷···········哈哈···········」敵人邊笑着，邊説着，照準張榮久頭上使勁兒踢了兩脚，他頓時暈了過去了。</p>
<p>這時雪比先前越下越大了，一陣陣怒吼的狂風也越刮越有勁兒了。雪落在鮮血裏面，全變做紅雪了。但，不一會兒，殷紅的血就全給白皚皚的雪蓋着，地上没有一點兒血跡，好像這兒没有過一次大屠殺，大流血似的。張榮久給風慢慢的吹醒，除了呼呼的風聲，已聽不到一點兒人聲，便偷偷的抬起頭來，望四面看了一眼，知道那些殘忍的劊子手全去了。他就慢慢兒的掙扎着爬了起來，頭還生痛的；踉踉蹌蹌的活動了一下四肢，低下頭覷着那些腦漿进裂，血肉糢糊的死屍，橫七竪八的地上全是，不覺徒然一驚，嗁得像瘋子一樣，傻子一般的滿山亂跑。亂跑了一會兒，他的鼻子裏突然嗅到一陣燒了東西的焦味，站着細細的看了一看，才知道自已跑到平頂山村子裏來了，可是整個村子的屋子已經燒完，只有餘燼在那兒燃着。他再抬起頭來向千金堡和栗子溝村一看：在那幕靄蒼茫裏，熊熊的火光在狂風中滾看，彷佛是落日的餘輝映得四面樹林子·········（完）</p>
<h3>上海夜話</h3>
<p>— 張若</p>
<p>小男人</p>
<p>從南京大戲院看完了「晚安，維也納」，在愛德第七世的大道上，電燈照耀如晝，那一串串的三連燈盞，像川字般掛在天空，一條幾萬枝燭兒人工的白虹，照着這一個不夜之城的康莊大道。上海之夜，多麽値得躦美吓！</p>
<p>我一個人在人行道上安步前進，耳官裏不留着「晚安，維也納」歌曲的旋律，腦海中還留着笑與歌，酒與女人的印像。我對於那個「歡笑與戀愛的城所，充滿浪漫零團氣的天堂」的維也納，夢想了十年的維也納，在銀幕上，我是滿足地神遊過一次了。</p>
<p>走到法租界最華麗的界區，便是那由三條模範街路匯作工字形的地叚；兩條橫的並行的霞飛與蒲石路橡一個「二」字，還有中間一條竪形作丨式的　爾西愛路，這三條紀念大將軍，大律師，大主敎的馬路，眞是最適宜於行人散步的好地帶吓！</p>
<p>像象牙又像自玉皇宮般的法國總會門口停了幾十部「雪鐡龍」和「雷腦」牌的大小汽車，圓旋門裏，吞没了一個法國少女的背影。在十四層樓摩天閣般的建築前，一個高大長材的白俄司關，百無聊賴地在契丹公寓門前踱來踱去。蘭心戲院和國泰戲院門前，紅綠的霓紅燈耀人眼簾，五點半的一塲剛散，九點十五分的夜戲還没有開映。看不見一男半女的影子，祇有廣告上那個長眼睫毛的葛萊泰嘉實的畫像，一種魅誘的臉部表情，看了使人心蕩。</p>
<p>在霞飛路旁網球大草地的對面，一家咖啡館的大玻璃窗上，寫着德國字「小男人」的招牌，我覺得需要休息，便推門進去了。</p>
<p>咖啡座位佈置得很摩登，坐在半環形的皮靠椅上感覺到異常的舒適與愉快。四壁是黃金色的燈兒，一個長身玉立裝扮得像　臘石像頭臉的少女，姗姗過來招待，我隨便呌了一客咖啡　　「你來自維也納嗎？」我因爲看見「小男人」的佈置，有維也納的風味，等到女招待拿了咖啡壼杯來的時候，我用這樣一句德國話問伊。</p>
<p>伊微笑着用德文回答：「我是從柏林來的。」</p>
<p>我的德文知識有限得很，我雖最近認識了一個維也納的靑年，卽現在在交通大學敎德文的羅逸民敎授，但是他深通中文，我們見面時，彼此都講中國話，這個來自奥國的靑年敎授他雖從小在維也納生長起來，却没得一口流利的北平話，我没有機會跟他學習德文，所以心裏有話，但是嘴裏説不出來，我是没法和那個來自柏林的侍女互通歌曲。</p>
<p>那個希臘石像般的侍女。穿了咖啡色的呢袍，棕黃的頭髮，梳得很整齊，靜穆的神態，好像是一尊古典派的雕塑。伊默默無言坐在帪台邊，一隻　光潔白的手，支住了下颔，望了玻璃櫃裏美麗的糖菓盒子，正在出神作遐思，燈下看看美人，是一張多麽有詩意靜穆的圖盡吓！</p>
<p>無線電放播着「大會之　」中的維也納歌曲：「可惜不過是這樣的一個今朝；將來終不會再逢到！這理想的現實太高貴了！好像天宫裏一道金光············」</p>
<p>我獨坐在「小男人」的皮大椅子裏，旣寂寞而又無聊。付了錢，走出門時，那個來自柏林的待女，用法文説了一聲「謝」ＭＥＫＣＩ，我也用法文回答伊：「晚安，再見，」ＢＯＮ，ＳＯＩＲ。ＡＵＲＥＶＯＩＲ</p>
<p>巴黎大戲院正在開映「維也納之夜」，我又把二小時可愛的上海之夜，在黑暗的世界中消麽過去了。</p>
<p>維也納與酒：笑與歌唱：上海與電影：咖啡與侍女：這是大都　的夜生活吓！</p>

<h3>後市</h3>
<p>下午開盤、卽高爲八百零三兩、物品開盤八百零二兩八錢、略見套出、乃爲二兩七錢、匯市除美金出價相同外、先令本月份六二五、似乎難結、福餘　進、乃盤旋而上至零三兩九錢、生大前來脱售、華比售出四月份美金</p>

<h3>英滙</h3>
<p>晨開近期出價一先令七便士六二五、匯豐首先售予正金二月份一先令七便六八七五、交易極少、入後又由匯豐塞出二月八七五、爲華比所吃、拖延至收盤、出價二·三月同爲一先令七便士六二五、四·五月同爲六八七五·下午中孚售予上海五月份七五、安達出四月份六八七五、（套英美匯兑者、）華比連續吃進二月份六二五、凡兩次、乃安達及匯豐所出、收盤出價二·三月份同爲一先令七便士六二五、進價爲六八七五、四·五月份出價同爲六八七五、進價七五、</p>

<h3>錢業市塲正式開做午市</h3>
<p>釐拆早午雷同···銅元縮風越常</p>
<h3>市塲一瞥</h3>
<p>錢業市塲當廢曆歲首開市以來、祇做早市、暫停午市交易、原爲每年習慣上之通例、今年因銀行方面以買賣不便起見、乃提早於元宵後卽行開做午市、其實　際上市面還　發動、銀洋用途猶在　寂之候、因無開做必要、所以昨日雖已開始午市交易、而做開交易狀况轉不及　日一市之盛、從可知其近來市面蕭索之崖略矣、</p>
<h3>釐拆同價</h3>
<p>「洋釐」早市因交易寥寥、競爭無人、結果釐價與前日相彷、略好一毫二忽半、篤七錢一分四釐六毫二忽半、詎午市交易更少、競爭更爲無人、以致釐價絲毫未有更動、與早市同價、爲七錢一分四釐六毫二忽半、「銀拆」早午兩市均開白借、銀根之鬆、用途之稀、爲全年中例淡之　有事實、劃頭亦白劃、</p>
<h3>銅元重幣</h3>

<h3>證劵二○關跌落一元</h3>
<p>丨交清價疲前途難期振作丨</p>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所公債市面、因連日來萎靡不振、人氣轉虚、塲上雖無大交易、而吃户尙在沉機觀變、靜待不動、空頭因無利可圖、亦不願抵補、散户多頭爲力薄弱、紛紛結出、市價雖無大軒輊、而趨勢已有不振之象、上午頭二盤零星散户售出、進户雖有、而扳價甚堅、加以四十七號亦有售出、每盤均回跌二三角之譜、午後開盤及十一號均有賣出、市價續小一二角、收盤三十二號略有吃進、檯面略有臨時空頭抵補、回上一二角、市價結果、除整六現貨因相隔日久、比較尚漲起六角外、餘則一致傾跌、其中以廿關跌一元左右爲最鉅、裁兵及廿捲亦跌去八角、餘則跌落二三角至五六角不等、交易淸、市價疲、每每引起此種局面、大户如尙不動辦、市價前途、尚難振作也、昨日成交總數、計共四百二十三萬二千元、内現貨祇一九關及整六各一千元、期貨　税一百萬、統税八十餘萬、裁兵亦有五十餘萬、其餘各種共佔一百數十萬、交易尚無起色、</p>
<h3>紐約股市堅挺</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週四紐約股市、情形愈堅、聯太平洋鐡路宜佈股息照舊、空户大起恐慌、紛紛將最近之軟弱股票補進、市况頓形上漲、末後因受芝加哥小麥疲萎影響、略有回落、全日成交數共一百零八萬股、又本週發表之經紀人放欵共四二七、○○○、○○○元、較前週計减三二、○○○、○○○元、銀行六十日及九十日期放欵利率爲百分之○·五、茲將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>標紗花平凡無特色</p>
<p>紗銷自新春半月以來、各邦皆無活躍之狀、查市上每日成交數量、僅有三四百包左右、此種情形、爲歷來所罕見、足見國内商業衰敗、農民生計困苦、至於華紗　納最大之南埠粤帮、去年故賬大遭虧累、迄今尙未理淸、金融方面萬分緊迫、所以目前進胃頗滯、蜀中戰後地方糜爛、長江一帶劣紗侵占、華北本紗運滬仍不斷絶、種種情形、均予紗銷不利、前途市價、恐難立定耳、</p>
<h3>人標起伏微極</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、以外棉回漲、人心稍振、散空抵補、各月漲三四錢、二三盤聞實需不良、又轉疲落、結果近漲二·三錢、遠跌一·二錢、午後市氣仍弱、近跌二錢、遠漲一·二·三錢、全日成交統計二萬一千八百包、查賣出長豐一千七百包、新華五百包、椿記七百包、　豐五百包、仁豐四百五十包、通記四百包、買進吉豐一千二百五十包、恒益八百包、明德八百五十包、瑞大五百包、槇記四百包、益昶四百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>花市狀况、略見平穏、然形勢依然軟弱、因海外棉市仍平淡、但金價堅硬、多頭心氣較定、而大部份棉商、皆在多頭地位、吸收之額、始終不動、惟現棉需要仍　、廠方視世界棉業仍在過　時代、而外棉仍有趨落之望、對於木棉意態甚懈、</p>
<h3>鄭標漲力脆弱</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、以外棉微漲、散空抵補、多頭購進、市况愈挺、各月漲二錢半、二三盤以賣方抛出又跌、結果漲五分至一錢、午後又漲五分至一錢、全日成交統計四萬二千五百担、查賣出益豐三千六百担、協生一千担、源大二千三百担、益成一千一百担、愼記一千七百担、仁豐一千二百担、穗隆一千六百担、裕康二千二百担、賣進吉豐三千三百担、　豐三千五百担、源興昌二千七百担、明德一千六百担、長豐一千担、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>外棉電告趨漲</h3>
<p>昨日美棉因布市良好、買户踴躍、市况堅强活潑、後因一部份多頭了結而疲、計期貨漲三至六磅音、現貨漲十磅音、英棉期貨漲四點、現貨漲二點、埃及棉現貨漲四點、印棉空户抵補、市况緊穏、計平果爾漲二羅比、奥姆辣漲二二五羅比、白羅溪漲一五羅比、原電錄左、（九日電）</p>

<h3>糧食糯米過時双跌半元</h3>
<p>杜粳客秈銷滯亦疲</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源四士餘艘、浦中存積尙可、各客頗願出售、乃滬埠自恪遵檢定所頒行市斛令於二月一日施用以來、已一星期餘昨市上忽有用六斗市斛者、船家頓起恐慌、相率擯斛、致零　買户納胃頓滯、市况因此傾下、常響蘇同南港靑角等米及杜洋尖價落一二角不等、變元以應時過令、去胃平淡、價修削半元之譜、陰元乏貨胃香、價格尙能站立、廠家貨售開計有陰變元及客元客尖　尖錫　崑粳等米、市况無甚軒輊也、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來船三十餘艘、白粳店胃價廉者稍化、市形又小角外、薄稻到貨無幾、零胃不惡、早稻到亦不旺、銷路絶平、市帶疲勢羊尖來貨不斷、零化滯細、小一二角、杜埠尖到少銷平、價小尺外、客尖亦滯疲勢、陰元乏到、日元到貨仍有、去化交平、價又跌二三角、</p>
<h3>閩帮暢辦紅糙米</h3>
<p>昨客秈市况、消化尙佳、惟到頭續旺、貨主均求售脱、因此行情反爲下落、昨日閩省城帮進胃甚佳、辦去雜到之湘紅糙米二千六百七十五包、價開七元三角、七元二角五六分至七元二角不等、本街胃口亦香、辦去湖南機紅米三百二十包、價八元六角至八元五角半、又江西機早一百五十包、價八元二角半至八元一角半、又機晚二百十包、價八元九角二分至八元六角半、各米高檔均居平勢、中次因貨主急脱、各小四五分、後首到頭尙旺、形勢亦無站象、</p>
<h3>粉麥市稍有參差</h3>
<p>粉市上午開市後、洋麥報小一二角、人心平軟、多趨觀望、廠方又有出意、奈以進户不旺、亦不敢售買、繼有天津帮在市收賈近月、胃口甚活、惟散廠仍有售出、行情未史十分總漲、而遠期各月交易甚淡、下午各盤均篤空拍、收市價二月大二五、三月大七五、四月在二五、五月小二五、六月不動、七月小二五、</p>
<p>麥市外訊報小一二角、但開市後、空頭抵補近期甚力、故本月份開價立大二分、繼有行家將前辦期洋麥在市套賣遠月、七月份突小五分、故下午開市、近月又被帶小、但行家見市價小後亦不再出、故七月份又回好三分、最後收市祇七月份較小二分、餘月均無出入云、</p>
<h3>黃荳走銷轉佳</h3>
<p>菉荳仍祇廣帮有去胃</p>
<p>黃荳昨市成交略多、厦門帮亦有辦胃、正陽　荳二車、大連荳本街辦進二車、又有四五車火車荳爲廠家辦去、浦東杜荳本街廣帮辦進六百餘包、市交雖活、然受去胃揀高而進、故市碼仍呆、菉荳依然勢軟、走化惟賴廣帮、别帮祇二三百包去胃、故市難轉佳、現小麥因貨枯乏到穏立、油市未開、荳餅市須看小面云、</p>
<h3>芝加哥小麥續疲</h3>
<p>週四芝加哥小麥、先因天氣不良而漲、後因多頭獲利了結而跌、又八日成交共二千萬蒲歇爾、</p>

<h3>糖市</h3>
<h3>糖市銷路沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以標金復升至八百兩外、在理當趨好勢、惟連日銷塲靜寂、兼之長江本街等帮對於新秤折實問題、表示不滿、迄示妥洽、故交易尤覺稀少、公會劃價二四組砂白呌好五分、爲十五兩七錢、未有成交、惟行方劃出路貨數百包、價爲十五兩六錢二分半、反較前市爲小、後市如無意外變動、當有轉鬆之可能、二十號中砂白及八九荷赤均無變動、建冰僅開出標準五福白冰二十箱、每砠價爲十三兩、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<h3>新鉛絲有猛漲現象</h3>
<p>昨五金交易、仍　活潑、木街客帮相織收　、而廠家建築帮等亦多問津、是以成交各　爲數　爲可觀、行情因海外市面絲漲、有提升之勢、惟新　絲之　况、更形良好、　申地底存　薄、而海外漲　凶　、如十六號至二十號要十七錢二先令六便士、二十一號至二十五號　二十二鎊十七先令六便士、比之申市佔盤、莫不更高出　許、以此本埠同業因　於此、故對於現量莫不　　收　、是以　　　一之勢、在今日之市塲中堪云獨步、　估盤　　　之節節升騰、　市十六號至二十號估十二兩七錢半、二十一號至二十五號十九兩二錢半、粗化色則　十兩光量、　昨開出共有一千數百扎、查係長江帮辦去、</p>

<h3>流浪漢</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>咱們上不瞞天，下不瞞地，全是些三光碼子。</p>
<p>嗎樣兒的三光？吃光！用光！當光！</p>
<p>咱們過日子的法門是：討把，攏地賭，倒棺材，裝準頭，抖路，推東洋車上橋。</p>
<p>今兒咱可走運！大淸早起，一出來溜躂就發了利市，碰着個西裝小夥子，胳臂上弔着個十八九歲的娘兒。那娘兒穿着件皮大　，大　下邊露出一大截血紅的旗袍，一雙高跟鞋底兒，走一步，各答各答的，眞發血！媽的！天氣這麽冷，咱的貼血穿了好幾個破洞，冷風忽溜忽溜的儘望破洞襄鑽，鑽得咱渾身皮兒肉兒全抖抖慄慄的不得勁。這小子，倒有得樂，兩口子擠得緊緊的，眼烏仁兒像長在腦門上一樣，全不溜旁人一溜。咱瞅了這小子一眼，心　裏就老大的不受用，存心挑這小子的烏雞眼兒，跟他抬槓。他們往東，咱也就緊釘着往東，他們往西，咱也就緊釘着往西。説也不相信，咱猜這兩口子準是膩得攢了迷兒啦，咱這麽釘着，他們就左給咱一個子兒，右給咱一個子兒的，給了咱一大疊。到後這小子纔　了過來，一跥脚，衝咱就喝：</p>
<p>「幹嗎？滾開！」</p>
<p>肩架兒，吐了口唾沬，咕囉了一句：「便宜了你這小囚　養的，咱老子不來割你的靴腰兒啦。」走了開去。</p>
<p>咱這個肚子可也作怪！没得把，不響，一挨着把，就咕囉咕囉的響個不停。咱剛想到那個高個兒的山東漢子攏的大餅擺上去買兩個鍋貼來啃嗬，可不知怎麽着，猛可　就「啊踢！啊踢」的接連來上兩個噴嚏，眼淚鼻涕悉悉索索的跟哈欠來上一大串。喔！乖乖了不得！咱的烟癮兒上來啦！咱也顧不得肚子餓，趕緊三脚兩步的跑到一爿雜貨朝陽門口，買了幾顆烟泡，兩三張土皮，忙不迭的就吞下肚去，這纔將就過了癮。可是，這麽一來，咱剛討得的幾個子兒就全完啦！</p>
<p>怎麽辦？咱總得想個法兒呀！這個肚子儘跟咱閙蹩扭，顧全了黑飯，白飯就落了空，多倃總有駝子跌交，兩頭不着實的時候。咱　在雜貨朝陽門口，心窩裏邊轉了一大堆念頭，可没一件幹得來的。這麽冷的天，又是大淸早起，路上只有不多幾個鬼影兒，呌咱往哪兒去放生意？咱要是也能跟那大夥兒的硬爬弟兄一樣，手裏邊有一桿噴筒，倒也不怕發不着利市；可咱就没得這傢伙，連跑早淸都幹不成，更别説撲風硬爬！咱只得揉一揉肚子，收緊了义兒繩，攢着一股勁兒就往前闖。（未完）</p>
<h3>「不通」兩種</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>人們批評文章，國文敎員式的人大槪是先着眼于」通」，或「不通」。然而做中國文其實是很不容易「通」的，高手如太史公司馬遷，倘將他的文章推敲起來，無論從文字，文法，修辭上的任何一種立塲去看，都可以發見「不通」的處所。</p>
<p>不過現在不説這些，要説的只是在籠統的一句「不通」之中，還可由原因而分爲幾種。大槪的説，就是有作者文理還没有通的，也有其實本可以通，而因了種種關係，不敢通，或不願通的。</p>
<p>例如去年十月三十一日「××報」的記載「江都淸賦風潮」，在「鄉民二度興波作浪」這一個巧妙的題目之下，述陳友亮之死云：</p>
<p>「陳友亮見官方軍警中，有携手槍之劉金發，竟欲奪劉之手槍，當被子彈出膛，飲彈而斃，警察隊亦開空槍一排，鄕民始後退。」</p>
<p>軍警上面，不必加上「官方」二字之類的廢話，這裏也且不説。最奇怪的是子彈竟被寫得好像活物，會自已跑出膛來似的。但因此而累得下文的「亦」字不通了。必須將上文改作「當被擊斃」，才妥。倘要保存上文，則將末兩句改爲「警察隊空槍亦同時發聲，鄉民始後退」，這才銖兩相稱，和軍警都無干係，丨丨雖然文理總未免有點稀奇。</p>
<p>現在這樣的稀奇文章，常常出現。其實也並非作者之有通，大抵倒是怕不准通，因而先就不敢通的緣故。頭等聰明人不談這些，就成了「爲藝術的藝術」家，次等聰明人用種種方法來粉飾這不通，就成了「民族主義」文學者，但兩者是都屬於自已「不願通」這一類裏的。</p>
<h3>「國際婦女協會」之企圖</h3>
<p>— 劍風</p>
<p>從前的人稱讚一個女子時，動輒就説「秀色可餐」或「傾城傾國」一類的話，這些形容詞的意思，明白點講，就是女子僅足供男人玩弄而已。近日年來，婦女已漸漸覺醒，她們以爲婦女除掉家庭方面應盡的職責之外，對於人類社會還應有所貢獻，所以她們一面努力於婦妇智識的提高，一面便從事婦女參政的運動。爲統一婦女運動的陣線起見，她們並有國際婦女協會的組織。還我自由，還我平等，便是該會的呼聲。</p>
<p>國際婦女參政協會成立已久，去年便已屆第十二屆大會開會之期，該會原擬去年五月間在希拉首都雅典開會，但因正値世界經濟恐慌，大會的召集，須要一筆鉅大的費用，同時由世界各國派遺代表赴會的旅費亦頗不易籌措，經幹部會議結果，决定延期今春在馬賽舉行臨時大會。現已發出請柬邀請參加該會的各國婦女團體選派代表出席，據説日本亦在被邀之列。</p>
<p>這次該會舉行臨時大會的主要目的，是因爲年來全世界的經濟陷於非常恐慌的境域，婦女多年奮鬥所獲得的職業，地位等等，都受了它的影響，現在大多數再被男子奪去；此外，像希拉，法蘭西，保加利亞，比利時，羅馬尼亞，瑞士······等國至今還祇承認女子有公民權，而不肯給她們以參政權：又如亞洲各國及南美的一大部份國家對於婦女選舉問題仍是懸而未决；就是英美德諸國雖已實施婦女選舉，但在法律上女人還受着差别的待遇。凡此種種，都是國際婦女協會會員認爲極不公平的事情。這就是該會所要討論和解决的問題。此外還有撤廢娼妓制度及廢止非洲和東方諸國的蓄婢娶妾等問題，也將在大會提出討論。</p>
<p>該會對於世界和平擁護甚力，該會會員都抱着偉大的理想，圖與男子共同努力消滅未來的戰爭並解决世界經濟恐慌的難關。該會曾這樣的宣言過：「我們是主張在政治、經濟、法律、道德各方面，男女應當享受平等待遇的團體。我們當以政治的手段和方法貫澈我們的目的。我們不願意世界再有慘酷的互相殘殺的戰爭出現，我們祈禱人類的和平永遠持續下去。國際聯盟是國際議會，它是維持世界和平的使者，是我們女子所始終擁護的：我們希望它能夠主持公道，能夠帮助我們達到我們的要求。我們希望與男子共同努力謀世界永遠和平的實現，並謀世界經濟的復興。這是我們的使命，我們正朝着這方向前進！·····」·</p>
<p>但世界和平早被日本破壞無遺，國際聯盟這滑稽劇台已被日本一足蹋翻，不知道今春這班「苦口婆心」的女菩薩集會時，有什麽神通可以制服獸一般猛惡的日本人没有？</p>
<h3>迎燈</h3>
<p>— 問冰</p>
<p>蹲在階沿下的琪兒，身上穿着一件七零八落的夾布短襖，和一條灰色的開襠褲；左手抓着一個小販失手落在地上的茡薺，不過一半已經吃到他的肚裏去了：右手拿着一塊石子，在麻石板上「畫符」；他那張灶神般的臉皮上，掛着兩條黃麵似的鼻涕，整整齊齊地掛在他的鼻孔下，只要等他動手吃那剩下的半個茡薺時，這「黃麵」也將隨着進去的。</p>
<p>他忽然呆住了，雙目不轉睛地望着一個牆洞，昨晚丨丨元宵丨丨提燈的玩意兒，在他眼前開演了。丨丨</p>
<p>「藏龍藏龍藏······」一些大孩子們擁着一隻充滿燭光的獅子燈，敲着大鑼大鼓往大街上直衝過去了。</p>
<p>「「淌淌·······　　·····」另一些比較小些的孩」子，敲着小鑼小鼓，擁着一隻白兎燈，跟着前面的獅子燈衝過去了。</p>
<p>「呵！呵呵！······呵！」這一班都是穿着胘人眼目的衣服的七八歲的孩子，各各擎着一根竹竿，上面頂着兎子，鳥兒，或者蝴蝶的燈，在短短的街上，呵呵地喊來喊去。小小的琪兒，始則驚奇發楞，後來眼紅了。他抱着希望之心去請求他的媽媽了。然而結果他祇得流着兩行熱淚，張開小口「吹喇叺」。</p>
<p>忽然他將眼光由牆洞移向家門口，迅速地站直了小腿，用手將快要堕下來的褲子向上　一；將「黃麵」用袖口一揩；嘴唇微微掀開而笑了；他又迅速地將手中的石子抛去，放開小步兒，跑向家去。</p>
<p>没有多少時候，他手裏擎着一根細竹竿，竿上高高地掛着他爸爸的一隻汚泥滿底的舊草鞋。</p>
<p>「呵！迎燈呵！呵！迎燈呵！」他臉朝天，看着他的「草鞋燈」，嘻開小嘴，不住地歡呼着：雖然那草鞋底上的泥砂，像胡椒般的，紛紛地飄落在他的小口裏·他可不管。</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 予展</p>
<p>一四川人與鴉片</p>
<p>友人有自成都大學退職歸者，云四川多鴉片，特税爲政府收入一大宗。又云，當地虎而冠者，每挾兩槍自隨，長槍殺人，短槍自殺。言下不勝喟然。予日，四川人種鴉片，至少有一千年歷史矣。客問予何所根據。予日，晚唐詩人雍陶西歸斜谷絶句云：行過險棧出褒斜，歷盡平川似到家。無限客愁今日散，馬前初見米囊花。米囊花卽罌粟花也。蘇軾有詩句云：道人勸飲雞蘇水，童子能煎罌粟湯。蘇轍亦有種藥苗詩，詠罌粟，蓋唐宋人以鴉片爲治疾珍藥也。雍陶蘇皆蜀人，可知遠在唐宋，四川人卽與鴉片有緣矣。</p>
<p>二　蓮花落詩人</p>
<p>友人芝岡禮吾最愛聽蓮花落。禮吾且能戞指作響，出口成詩，如唱蓮花，朋輩資爲諧笑。</p>
<p>五六年來，吾人皆衣食於奔走，蓬轉四方，長沙蓮花落無復人耳。九一八事變以後，吾見申報所載不除庭草齋夫談薈，常夾詠歎時事之白話詩，頗有蓮花落韻味。吾亦竊取唐代詩人張祜詩句「等閑緝掇間言語，誇向時人喚作討」，作國事吟等詩數十首，以攎憂僨，卽事狂吟，無殊蓮花落之意，但不曾持此乞錢換米耳。蓮花落不知起於何時，在元雜劇及明傳奇中皆見乞兒唱蓮花落　。五燈會元載俞道婆隨衆參琅琊，一日聞丐者唱蓮花樂，大悟似宋已時有蓮花落矣」又全唐詩引候請錄：唐　有一折衫　子，作舞歌唱云，「執板狂歌乞個錢，　中流浪且隨緣，直　到老常如此，猶勝危時弄化權。」此殆爲最早之蓮花落詩人欺？</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路　（稿）</h3>
<p>— 張賣平</p>
<p>他這樣想着，再抑制不住了。他大踏步直衝進鶴子夫人的房裏來。</p>
<p>「你們欺侮曾先生不在家啊！」</p>
<p>他在興奮之中，也竟能夠顧到這個名義，提出來向那個日本佬宣戰。那個日本佬正想起身和他行個早晨的見面禮，但不提防，嘴角上早挨了他的一掌。</p>
<p>「啊啊！啊啊」</p>
<p>海泉高喊着，第二掌又飛過來了。這次的一掌眞激怒了那個日本佬。他退向那頭　口邊云，把中國大掛脱了下來，向地上一摔，就磨拳擦掌起來，準備「相撲」（Sumo）了。</p>
<p>「不得了！······」</p>
<p>海泉聽見後面發出一陣像鋼筆尖那樣尖利的聲音。他正在爲難的瞬間，丨丨想退出去，怕給日本佬看輕；不退出去，和日本佬打了架後，不論勝負，一定是自已吃虧的。恐怕還要在巡捕房裏關幾天呢！幾天猶可，萬一判了一個相當長期的徒刑，如何是好呢？因爲租界内的法律是包庇帝國主義者蹂躏中國平民的法律！</p>
<p>「林先生，他是我的爸爸喲！」</p>
<p>他給她抱住了，同時　着了一陣會使他麻醉的香氣。他一面籌思要出怎樣的態度對付當前的難局，一面在拼命地鑑賞從她身上發散出來的香氣。</p>
<p>她又向着那個日本佬説了一陣日本話。他還没有見明白那個日本佬在表示　何的態度，已經給鶴子夫人拼命地半拖半抱，拉到房門外來了。</p>
<p>他只是滿臉發靑，一句話也不會説了。</p>
<p>「林先生，對不住了。我該早告訴你知道他是我的父親的。······你回你的房裏去吧，看我的面上。」</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>舊事重提</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>幾大以前，因爲一時的「義憤塡　」，便爲北平大學生及學校當局等「仗義執言」了幾句，題目呌做「北平各大學吃排頭」。不料引起了「笑」先生提出了古物南運問題，其後自由談的何家幹先生再來個總結，大意謂：古物之南運，爲的是可以賣錢，假如大學生亦能賣出高價·那末·少不了亦將用鐡悶車裝運南來矣。</p>
<p>於此可知，國家「中堅份子」之遠不如古董擋案，其理至明。不過據報紙上看來，却又不免使我們狐疑，因爲當局的好意，只是「决定南遷」·並没有提到發賣一事，而且將來還要送回北平哩，不過没有規定日期罷了。所以我們的臆斷，究竟没有决議案來得準確。</p>
<p>檔案古董能否賣錢，我想誰都會理會得到。旣能賣錢，而且又是故宮故物。其價値連城，當然可想而知，假如有誰得以攫爲私有，當然發財可至於無岸無邊，自不待言·即以之進貢王朝，官亦當不在一品之下。幸而中國有一個萬古千秋的上海，否則萬一給「匈奴」掠去，那還了得。即使黃河以北，盡爲夷狄江山，再以長江流域的山水鍾靈之處·定爲大中華民國之行都的時候，我們之文物精靈的古物擋案·還可改坐鐡悶飛機運往帕米爾高原，到他年萬里山河皆聞鬼哭的時候，我們有了這許多聖朝寳物，於是在我們的精神上，仍不失爲「文物之邦」。至於是否僥倖還可送回故宮，我們且待那時再看罷。萬一不幸短命死焉·亦可於遺囑上載上一筆·敎兒孫後代不妨到故都去走上一遭。</p>
<p>其次·大學生在市塲没有定價，何先生固然説得千眞萬確，我們所聽着的販賣人口，無非是孩子與女人，並没有將大學生亦算在其内。不過我們也曾聽見過林肯解放黑奴的故事，可見黑人在給白人征服了以後，乃是被白人買賣於市塲的。不過黑奴當中不一定若有大學生，但到那時候·大學生會不會脱掉中國人的原形呢？因爲照這樣「長期」下去，中國之被零躉拍賣，不見得是完全没有希望的。</p>

<h3>染髮之又一法</h3>
<p>— 白髮少年</p>
<p>前見本刊沈爾明先生介紹之染髮法，作者因年來三十，白髮已滿頭，故依法製之，結果不甚美滿。且因有毒，不敢多試。今作者自已製成染髮水一種結果尙佳，製法便利，且無毒之危險，不敢自秘，特介紹於下：</p>
<p>染髮藥水，分甲乙兩種，先後並用之。其製法如下，</p>
<p>甲種　以硝酸銀十克鎔於一百克蒸溜水中，即得。担不可用常水，因常水含有綠化合物，易與硝酸銀化合，作白色沉澱，遂减其效用。</p>
<p>乙種　以硫化鈉四·六克鎔解於一百克水中，即得。此物雖不若甲種藥品之必須蒸溜水，但忌與金屬接觸。</p>
<p>以上二種藥水，皆須盛於深色（藍或棕黃色）之玻璃瓶中，因白色瓶，直接受陽光之照射，將變其品質。</p>
<p>使用時，先將頭洗凈，乾燥後，以小刷蘸甲種染髮水·遍刷白髮上。待乾（約須五分鐘）再以另一小刷蘸乙種染髮水塗之。因二種藥品，起化學變化，成黑色之硫化銀，能固着於頭髮之上。欲免波及面部，及頸項等之皮膚，亦染有黑斑，可預先以凡土林或其他油脂薄塗一層。用牙粉和以肥皂洗之。</p>
<h3>液體潤髮劑</h3>
<p>頭髮常因脂肪之不足，而致枯燥。蓋頭髮本身日常分泌適量油脂，若因病理現象，脂肪减少，必致黃萎乾枯，甚致脱落。平時洗髮，固爲淸潔頭髮，但亦須常搽油脂類之製品以補油脂之不足。固體潤髮膏，如司丹康之類，本刊早已披露，現再介紹一液體潤髮劑於後：</p>
<p>原料　蓖蔴油三十五克，杏仁（榨出）油二百五十克，甘油一百十克，香料十三克，酒精適景。</p>
<p>製法　以蓖蔴油置一大杯中，與杏仁油混和之。同時，以甘油及香料，共鎔解於五百克之酒精中。以此二物混合，拌攪均匀，再加適量之酒精，調合成一千克之潤髮劑。</p>
<h3>無垢潤髮膏</h3>
<p>欲使頭髮光潤，我人常用司丹康之類潤髮油膏但油能積垢，尤以常往來於街市者，髮中灰塵滿積，頗不合衛生，今特以無垢潤髮膏之製法列後；</p>
<p>原料　西黃蓍樹膠十克，甘油十克，酒精二十克，玫瑰油二十克，熱水二百四十克。</p>
<p>製法　先以玫瑰油（或用其他香料亦可）及甘油，鎔解於酒精中，調匀後再置一乳鉢中，與樹膠混和，最後加以熱水，不絶攪拌待冷即得一匀凈之潤髮膏。</p>
<h3>夢的幻滅</h3>
<p>— 沈濱</p>
<p>滿天忽然籠罩着一片灰色，寒暑表上的水銀驟然的降到了三十度以下，西北角揚起了如烟的塵埃，漸移漸近，「呼！呼！」的作響！啊！大風來了！而且帶着了雪花！</p>
<p>我在戰慄着，在一間又小又矮的茅屋中，那時我的妻似乎也在我的旁邊，大家縮着頸，望着屋外，嘴裏吹着白氣，風愈吹愈緊，雪也越來越大，頓時，灰色的宇宙，變成了銀白的世界！</p>
<p>「你冷嗎」？我對妻説。</p>
<p>「怎麽不冷，可是有什麽法想」？</p>
<p>我們再也忍不住這寒嚴，妻拿了些壁角裏的木屑，放在一隻破鉢中，我拿着火柴，燃在木屑上，忽的，全部的木屑都燃燒起來，我和妻大家都笑起來！</p>
<p>我們對面坐着。覺得全身温暖了一點！</p>
<p>「老李！」</p>
<p>忽的，這聲音從遠處傳來，我們都注視着這聲的來處。</p>
<p>「啊！小二嗎？你怎麽現在又活在世上，不是前天在報紙上看見你在榆關給敵人打死了嗎？」</p>
<p>這是使我們很驚奇而意外的事，怎麽一年前的小二，早已給日本兵打死，而現在又來了呢？我們祇見他的身上著着破舊的軍服，由滿身濺滿了的雪花中，隠約可以看出斑斑的血跡！他由遠遠地走來，終於到了我們矮小的茅屋中，我們請他在我們的火鉢旁坐下。</p>
<p>「老李！我没有死！我並没有死？」　　「啊！你没有死嗎？那末，前天的報紙上登着你死的消息呢」！我的妻説。</p>
<p>「這我不管，我並没有知道，我不會死，我將永遠的生存着呢」！</p>
<p>「好！那末我替國家祝福，我們還有我們的健兒！小二，願你多殺掉幾個敵人的頭吧」！</p>
<p>我説罷，大家都笑起來！</p>
<p>「老李！閒話不要多説，我告訴你個消息」。</p>
<p>「怎麽······？」</p>
<p>「山海關是失守了，日兵愈來愈多，他們現在正預備總攻我們的熱河，我現在來告訴你吧！我們抱着長期不抵抗的政府，現在已正式的抵抗了，有成千萬的北兄們，有許多的軍火，都在昨天從中樞運往我們的東北，我們多麽的快活啊！我没有死，我不會死！啊！老李！這不是很好的時候嗎？我們大家去吧！政府在抵抗了，我們大家去殺我們的敵人吧！我們要收復失地，踏平三島···</p>
<p>···」</p>
<p>他很興奮的説着，忽然被我妻把他的話打斷了！</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？政府是不依賴國聯了嗎」？</p>
<p>「國聯有什麽用？他們是幾個强國的分贓的機關，現在，我們的政府是覺悟了！」</p>
<p>不足以打倒他</p>
<p>民衆與論</p>
<p>不抵抗主義</p>
<p>不抵抗主義</p>
<p>外患</p>
<p>次焱</p>
<p>「好，那麽我們去吧」！我們大家都喊着。</p>
<p>「喂！娟！你是個女人，你不能去」！小二對我的妻説。</p>
<p>「難道女人不能捍衛國家的事嗎」？</p>
<p>「好！那麽你去做個救護員」！</p>
<p>「喂！聽！聽！」</p>
<p>「什麽？」</p>
<p>「這不是軍號的聲音嗎」？</p>
<p>「走吧！快！領軍械去！快！」</p>
<p>那時，我們在大雪紛飛中走着，拼命的走着，忽的「砰！砰！」幾聲！我的妻忽然在前面倒在地上了！</p>
<p>「啊！啊！」</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>我終於喊於喊出了聲來，兩眼睜開，我還獨個兒睡在床上，太陽已射到了我的窗上，對門的王家，正在「笨！伯！···笨！伯！」的放着砲仗！啊！今天不是廢歷的元旦嗎？於是我感到我剛才做的夢的幻滅！就一骨碌的起來！</p>
<h3>中國人聰明外國人聰明</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>過電車生活的寫字間先生時常聽見「帮帮忙」揩油招呼。説起來揩外國人的油，我們落得帮帮忙，利人不損已，這種聰明事何樂而不爲？</p>
<p>但是倒底外國人聰明，又在茶餘飯後談論起來。爲的是公共汽車上裝置了許多祇進不出的機器。買一張标，有一枚鉛幣。你要下去，非將鉛幣塞進機器不可。賣票人喊「嘸生路，」乘客説「不便當。」但是你不能揩一枚銅元的油，「外國人倒底聰明！」</p>
<p>公共汽車到站了，賣票掃着乞憐的目光，向每個下車的乘客説：「帮帮忙。」</p>
<p>要下車旣非投鉛幣不可，難道汽車停在行人熙攘往來的都市街道旁從窗口中跳出去？可是你不知道中國人也聰明的，他會拉　進口的門，在半進半出的時候，帮忙的朋友從説時慢，那時快之問偷税出去。</p>
<p>「帮帮忙」再向第二佃個揩外國人的油，落得帮帮忙的帮忙朋友説。</p>
<p>防中國人揩油，外國人造出祇進不出的機器：外國人裝置了祇進不出的機器，中國人還是照樣揩油。外國人聰明，中國人聰明？</p>

<h3>兄和妹</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個孤零的弱女，在九歲時，老天就奪了我慈愛的雙親：單捨下我們兄妹兩人。爲了没有遺産，我就住在堂伯父家中，兄長則出外習業。現在我們均已長大成人，論理我們史妹兩人，應當怎樣地和睦啊！但是爲了異母所生的緣故，他待我非常冷淡。在這幾年裏，我們雖有信札往來，但是總不過説些門面話罷了。近來更不行了，我幾次去信，他竟置之不復；幾次訪他，他避不一面；最近据説他調往南京辦事，連通信處，都不屑給我知道。前天遇到他的朋友，才知道他竟聲言不認我做他妹子了！證以近來他的態度，這話當然不錯的。我爲了將來妥當計，想正式和他脱離兄妹關係，不知是否可以；在登報聲明之前，是否要得到他的同意；否則偏面的聲明，是否有效？</p>
<p>我現在伯父店裏，做一個臨時職員，看來前途没有出息，想投身銀幕界；不知這是否是適宜於我的職業？</p>
<p>以上兩個問題，我實在疑惑不决；所以特地寫這封信，請先生指敎我，那是很盻望的。祝你</p>
<p>康健　　　吳玉瑛啓</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>編者按；吳女士的兄妹，因爲患難與共的缘故，論理是應當彼此憐惜，格外和睦的。不幸她的兄長，被「異母所生」四個字橫塞胸際，竟至彼此參商，視同陌路，這的確是非常痛心的。但是我們以爲吳女士也没有理由，定要正式聲明脱離兄妹關係。要知道，法律上成年的兄妹，相互間本没有若何拘束的。而且在事實上，因爲没有遺産，更不會發生糾葛。所以兄妹關係的繼續存在，將來也不致發生不妥當的地方，反可留作將來言歸於好的餘地。</p>
<p>適宜於女子做的職業，非常之多，電影當然也是其中之一。不過這是需要「天才」與「興趣」的。現在很有人高呌打倒「天才」於許多事情，當然對的；但是我們終以爲藝術方面，「天才」是不可缺的，東施效顰，一輩子不討好的。至於興趣方面，吳女士更應當深切地考量一下·不能單看一般明星外表的顯輝，而必須看到他們成功的困難才行。吳女士的天才與興趣，我們不敢武斷；總之電影却是合於女子做的職業，只須你有這種天才這種興趣罷了。</p>
<p>末了我們還有一層疑問，吳女士以前，有没有將「要投身銀幕」的志願，告訴兄長？倘使有的話，我們還疑心你兄長近來的態度，也許與此多少有些關係。這不過是他的頑固，吳女士可以不顧。希望你爲藝術而投身銀幕，希望你成功，更希望你使你的頑固阿兄，無所藉口，並且舌橋不置。</p>

<h3>詩禮人家　（十七續）</h3>
<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>阿麗見了若華，開口大太太，閉口大太太，把若華説惱了，當着阿麗又將茂生打了一頓，這分明是「打在他身，羞在我臉」，阿麗臉上如何擱得下去？她仗着大太太曾認過她爲女兒，以姑奶奶的資格足與姨太太分庭抗禮。她與若華爭閙起來，二人各不相讓，後來還是黛秋出來，將阿麗勸了出去。</p>
<p>若華以爲阿麗是一個遣嫁的丫頭，不該這樣放肆無禮，便命老胡去通知桑阿强，限他在一月内交還房屋，不准他在墻門間内開設裁縫舗。誰知桑阿强能度很是强硬。他拿出一張租契來，説是夏家與他訂過二十年的租借契約，房東要收回房屋，須要償還他二十年的營業損失丨每月止少限度以三百元計算，這筆損失費就是將房東的房産變賣了，還不夠賠償他的。</p>
<p>若華聽了老胡的回話，與幼中商量了一番，也自奈何桑阿强不得，只把死去的大太太駡了一頓，並訓誡茂生，以後不准到裁縫舖裏去胡閙。</p>
<p>（九）兄弟如手足，妻子如衣服</p>
<p>夏仲南倒了，各處控告他的案件像雪片般飛來，控案中有一大半是説他的姨太太艾若華得賄賣缺，這都是太太瞞着老爺的事，經手人是五老爺夏幼中，案發之後，仲南還是莫名其妙。怪不得幼中一聽仲南被扣留的消息，連夜帶了嫂子逃走，原來他們都是舞弊行賄的主犯。</p>
<p>銀錢到了做官的袋裏，就像姜子牙賣灰麵一樣，一陣風來早已吹得烏有，要想原物歸還，那是「鼻尖上掛鮝魚」，休想休想！夏仲南被禁錮了年餘，只有拚着老命一條，要他嘔出錢來，却分文没有。大家都知道他的贓欵早被兄弟和太太運回去了，只是他的家鄉所在地，爲天南政府的政治勢力所達不到的地方，無法去抄没他的家産來抵償，逼死了他又有什麽用處呢？</p>
<p>仲南在卑濕的優待室裏，看管了一年有半，漸漸的得了個半身不遂的病症，將他移押到醫院裏，又住了幾個月，上峯看他石子裏實在逼不出油來，那時恰巧又有人來替他説情，便樂得賣一個交情將他放了。</p>
<p>他恢復了自由以後，立刻打電報回家告訴太太，要她到碼頭上來迎接。他當夜搭船動身北上。船到家鄉，若華帶了女兒和兄弟幼中去歡迎，看見他面孔腫了，頭髮白了，形容非常憔悴，半身不能動彈，竟成了一個新鮮活死人，幼中帶了一個健僕，名呌阿海。由阿海背了二老爺登岸，裝入車子，才將他載了回來。</p>
<p>仲南回到家裏，伯東季北兩個老弟兄都來探望過他一次。幼中天天去陪着他談笑。若華却待他十分冷淡。倒是黛秋很殷勤的服待着他。若華總是在他面前説兒子茂生的壞話，因爲她説得孩子太壞過了頭，反而引起了仲南的疑心。他心想茂生雖不長進，未必壞到如此地步，定是她用後母的心腸去待兒子。因此他反而另眼看待着茂生。爲了袒護小孩子的細故，老夫妻常常的發生口角。　　若華時常打扮得花枝招展的出去游玩應酬，仲南躺在睡椅上看着，心裏著實有氣，也曾勸過她多次，她只是不聽。這一天，她又換了鮮艶衣服，搔首弄姿的走過他面前，他喚住了她，柔聲問道：（未完）</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Awaits Japan's Answer to Two Key Questions</h3>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting for Careful Consideration</p>
<p>Committee of Nine Continues Drafting Work, Formulating Proposals</p>
<p>(Geneva) There appears to be no major development regarding the Sino-Japanese issue today, as the core leadership of the Disarmament Conference is eager to proceed with its work. It is unlikely to adjourn early tonight, thus giving the Committee of Nine time to reconvene. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Drafting Committee plans to submit its drafted report on the Manchurian dispute to the plenary meeting of the Committee of Nineteen on Monday, in preparation for discussion at the League of Nations Assembly next week. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nine held a meeting tonight to discuss in detail, from all angles, the legal and specialized aspects of any possible solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Each member felt that creating a precedent in the League of Nations records would place a heavy responsibility on the committee itself, so all advocated for careful consideration. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's new proposal, which it claims is its final suggestion, was discussed in a closed-door debate of the Committee of Nineteen today. According to usually reliable sources, the meeting expressed satisfaction with Japan's recognition of the ten points outlined in Chapter Ten of the Lytton Report. However, Japan's interpretation still differs significantly from the Committee's understanding, particularly regarding the sovereignty of Manchuria. The Committee has decided that sovereignty should belong to China, whereas Japan believes the opposite. Therefore, the Committee has now formulated a definitive question for Japan to answer: whether Japan can, in principle, recognize Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria. Future developments will depend on Japan's answer. If the answer is negative, a sharp conflict will be unavoidable, and the League of Nations will inevitably break with Japan. It is rumored that some behind the scenes are gently persuading Japan to withdraw its troops as soon as possible and cease its military aggression against China, but it is uncertain whether this will be effective. (National Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<h3>Surprising Developments Expected in Geneva</h3>
<p>(Geneva) There is a sense here that surprising progress is being made and may soon occur. The League of Nations has asked Japan for a clear and definitive response on whether the current system in Manchuria is an acceptable solution. Japanese representative Matsuoka expressed surprise at the League's raising this question, believing that Japan's position had already been explained. Matsuoka is currently drafting a response and consulting with Tokyo. Other members of the Japanese delegation share Matsuoka's view, stating that Japan's position has been repeatedly explained to the League of Nations, making a clear "yes" or "no" answer unnecessary. Regarding the Jehol issue, it is rumored that the Japanese side intends to declare its peaceful intentions and point to Chinese troops as a disruptive element, thus demanding the withdrawal of Chinese forces. The focus of the current situation is on Japan. How things develop from here will depend on Japan's response to today's important question.</p>
<h3>Prediction of a Negative Japanese Response</h3>
<p>It is rumored that Japan's response will not be issued for two or three days. Although it is generally expected that Japan's response will be negative, some believe that Japan will make a final effort and not abandon its mediating position. The only option after mediation fails is for the League of Nations to issue its report and recommendations, which it deems fair and appropriate. However, Japan must carefully consider what benefit it would derive from the League of Nations acting under Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant.</p>
<h3>Japan Has Two Paths to Choose</h3>
<p>Assuming Japan does not completely break with the League of Nations, which would be more advantageous for Japan: proceeding under Article 15, Paragraph 3, or Paragraph 4? This is the question currently being discussed. Under Paragraph 3, Japan must accept the resolution of December 15, with the right to submit reservations regarding the explanatory memorandum. The invitation to the United States and Russia to participate could also be rescinded. Under Paragraph 4, the terms of the December 15 resolution will be strengthened, the United States and Russia must be invited to participate, and the overall situation will become more serious.</p>
<h3>Withdrawal Will Lead to Isolation</h3>
<p>If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, as reported from Tokyo, it will sacrifice its powerful position within the League, allowing China to monopolize the field and causing the major powers to face the most troublesome issue of a European war. The above is all material for general discussion tonight.</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Japan from the Puppet State</h3>
<p>During the meeting of the Committee of Nine tonight, several members mentioned the possibility of the Committee suggesting economic sanctions and the withdrawal of consuls from "Manchukuo." The thinking of some is evident from this. Some in the meeting even argued that it is impossible to distinguish between Japan and "Manchukuo." Although representatives of major powers have not acknowledged the potential, this issue is now entering uncharted territory, and various unpleasant possibilities may arise. This is generally acknowledged.</p>
<h3>Drafting Committee's Most Difficult Task</h3>
<p>If mediation fails, an organization must be established to act on behalf of the League of Nations to monitor the implementation of the recommendations. The Committee of Nine also discussed the organization's powers, structure, and responsibilities. The Committee met for two hours and adjourned without a concrete resolution, but many expressed their views on this issue. The Committee plans to reconvene tomorrow, or if time does not permit, to meet on Saturday morning. It is noteworthy that the Disarmament Conference met for two hours today and then adjourned to allow the Committee of Nine to meet in a timely manner, highlighting the importance attached to the Sino-Japanese issue.</p>
<h3>Meticulous Discussion of Monitoring Organization</h3>
<p>The Committee met at 7:30 PM tonight, focusing almost entirely on the establishment of a monitoring organization. This is likely to be an extremely difficult task for the Drafting Committee and will probably be submitted to the Committee of Nineteen for guidance. The most difficult point is the issue of the Committee's qualifications. The general opinion seems to be that the Executive Council must decide whether the Committee has this authority. However, there is no precedent to guide the Committee's powers. This is also generally understood. Therefore, if both parties agree to open negotiations, what exactly would be the role of this Committee? Should the Committee consult with both parties, observe from the sidelines, provide advice when necessary, have the power to issue measures in the form of orders, be purely advisory, or have the power to arbitrate and interpret League of Nations resolutions? If both parties are unwilling to open negotiations, would this Committee have the power to propose plans such as economic sanctions or the withdrawal of consuls? The Committee discussed these points at the meeting, and the views expressed were mostly speculative, as there was no precedent to follow, and all members understood the seriousness of their decisions. Inviting the United States and Russia to join is also a difficult issue, as it is questionable whether the Committee has a sound legal basis for inviting non-member states to participate in a substantive League of Nations body, or whether the Committee is merely inviting non-member states to attend as advisors. There is a strong feeling tonight that there will be surprising developments in Geneva. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Extreme Tension in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>For the League of Nations' Question</p>
<p>Carefully Considering the Reply</p>
<p>Telegraphing Matsuoka to Await Instructions</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the increasingly deteriorating situation in the League of Nations, the Japanese government convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 1:00 PM today in the Diet building. Foreign Minister Uchida reported on the League of Nations' developments, and they discussed countermeasures. As important telegrams from the Japanese delegation in Geneva were arriving in Tokyo in rapid succession, it was decided to be prepared to convene cabinet meetings at any time. An extraordinary cabinet meeting may be held on the upcoming Kigen-setsu (National Foundation Day). (Domei News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet held an extraordinary cabinet meeting in the Diet building. Foreign Minister Uchida reported on the proceedings of yesterday's Committee of Nineteen, stating that Matsuoka, based on the instructions of the 8th, had presented a new mediation proposal to the League of Nations. However, the Committee of Nineteen did not accept the Japanese proposal and instead asked the Japanese government to clearly answer in writing whether it recognized Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria. The League of Nations is aware that Japan has recognized "Manchukuo" as an independent state, approved by the Japanese Emperor and with exchanged protocols. This attitude of the League of Nations is intended to shake Japan's national policy and push Manchuria into an irreparable situation. Therefore, there can be no further concessions. The content of the response is of great importance to Japan's future and cannot be left to the discretion of the representative. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will draft a reply and instruct Matsuoka to submit it. It is reported that the cabinet ministers have decided to leave Foreign Minister Uchida to handle the situation skillfully. After the cabinet meeting, Uchida reconvened a ministry meeting to deliberate on the contents of the reply. It is rumored that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already telegraphed Representative Matsuoka not to reply to the League of Nations without authorization. (China United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After receiving Matsuoka's report, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a ministry meeting today to deliberate on the reply. Foreign Minister Uchida, Vice Minister Arita, Asian Affairs Bureau Director-General Tani, and Information Bureau Director Shiratori attended. They decided to consult with the military before drafting a reply to be telegraphed to Matsuoka for submission to the League of Nations. After the ministry meeting, a director-general, on behalf of Foreign Minister Uchida, told the Japanese press that, judging from the atmosphere of yesterday's meeting, the mediation efforts of the Third Section had concluded, and the Committee of Nineteen might proceed to the work of the Fourth Section. The recommendations of the Fourth Section are clearly more disadvantageous to Japan than the mediation of the Third Section. However, even if Japan is dealt with by the recommendations of the Fourth Section, it is not necessary to withdraw from the League of Nations immediately. The issue of withdrawal depends on whether the League of Nations' actions could shake Japan's national policy. Japan has been formally authorized by the Emperor to recognize "Manchukuo," a fact of great importance to the government's responsibility. If the League of Nations insists on erasing this fact, Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations without hesitation. (China United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, the Committee of Nineteen only raised ambiguous wording in Japan's new proposal and asked the Japanese government to clarify it. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs considered this an insult to the face of a great power and a severe denigration of Japan's continental policy. Therefore, it convened ministry meetings one after another to discuss how to respond. According to the Tokyo News, a meeting of bureau directors was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM today.</p>
<p>As a result, it was decided to instruct Matsuoka Yosuke to submit the draft reply he had prepared to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If it did not differ significantly from the Ministry's views, it would be revised and added to. Otherwise, a new draft would be prepared. Various newspapers reported that the delegation's reply was very passive, taking a defensive approach to interpreting Japan's claims. Rather than that, it would be better to take an active offensive, denying the questions of the Committee of Nineteen entirely, explaining Japan's national policy, and strongly asserting that the League of Nations should bear the responsibility for the failure of mediation. At 6:00 PM, Matsuoka was instructed to submit the delegation's draft to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (China United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo News, the content of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reply consists of three points, asserting that Manchurian independence is the fundamental principle for resolving all Sino-Japanese disputes. The outline is as follows: (1) Manchurian independence is based on the self-determination of thirty million Chinese people, based on the spirit of national self-determination. Japan, as an independent nation, recognizes its independence and will not allow interference from third countries. (2) The absence of organized and well-ordered Chinese rule in Manchuria is not only a misfortune for the thirty million people, but it also means that Sino-Japanese disputes can never be resolved. (3) No matter what pressure is exerted, "Manchukuo" cannot be abolished, or the policy towards it changed. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reply will be issued after the 13th. (China United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A responsible spokesperson for the Japanese delegation issued the following statement to the press: "At this juncture, when the mediation process is nearing completion due to Japan's new concessions, the Committee of Nineteen believes it should adopt a motion that would undermine the overall situation. The Japanese government must be surprised that the Committee of Nineteen, until the very last minute, has raised two questions requiring answers, one of which must be answered in writing. This inexplicable action may be a deliberate act of trickery. However, there are many enlightened individuals in the Committee of Nineteen, so why engage in such obvious trickery? Let us set aside the second question for the moment. The first question is also untenable. For months, the Committee of Nineteen and world opinion have understood the Tokyo government's view of Manchuria. Now, to ask us to acknowledge in writing Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria is tantamount to forcing us to abandon our recognition of 'Manchukuo,' whose existence we consider indispensable to peace in the Far East. After knowing our unwavering determination, the Committee of Nineteen wants us to deny our original policy, which we cannot understand. We could have answered the Committee of Nineteen immediately without consulting our government, but we prefer to remain calm, draft a reply, and submit it to the government for approval. Some are now trying to shift the blame for the ultimate failure of the mediation process onto Japan. We do not want to fall into their trap. In fact, if the Committee of Nineteen insists on its attitude, the ultimate failure of the mediation process will be unavoidable." It is generally believed that the Japanese delegation's reply to the Committee of Nineteen will not be submitted before tomorrow. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Drummond Meets Matsuoka</h3>
<p>Conveying the Questions of the Special Committee</p>
<p>Japanese Military Aggression in Jehol</p>
<p>Matsuoka Still Claims Self-Defense</p>
<p>(Geneva) Drummond met with Matsuoka Yosuke at 4:00 PM today to convey the questions of the Committee of Nineteen and the issue of Japanese military aggression in Jehol. The Japanese representative held a delegation meeting from 5:30 PM to 6:20 PM. It is rumored that the Japanese side has decided to reject the questions of the Committee of Nineteen and will not consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but will hold another representative meeting tomorrow morning to draft a statement of opposition, which will consist of three parts: (1) opposition to the questions of the Committee of Nineteen, (2) reasons for terminating the conciliation negotiations, and (3) a statement opposing the recommendations based on Article 15, Paragraph 5 of the Covenant. (China United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond reported to the Committee of Nineteen this morning that, after being entrusted yesterday, he had met with Japanese representative Matsuoka to verbally draw his attention to the continued military preparations near Jehol. Drummond also detailed the circumstances of the meeting, but as it was only verbal and not a formal discussion, the Special Committee could not take any action based on this information and must await a formal reply from the Japanese side before making a decision. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen received news that Japan was continuing military preparations and engaging in military actions, which it believed would further escalate the situation and risk rendering mediation efforts futile. It entrusted Secretary-General Drummond to verbally express its concerns to the Japanese delegation. This afternoon, Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke met with Drummond and replied that Japan's actions were merely self-defense against the intentions of the Chinese authorities. Regarding the question raised by the Committee of Nineteen about whether it recognized Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria, Matsuoka Yosuke said that he would reply in writing. According to Japanese sources, this reply will be negative. In this case, it is natural for the Committee of Nineteen to immediately invoke Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. Therefore, the Drafting Committee will begin drafting recommendations tonight to be included in the report to be submitted to the General Assembly. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Young Diplomats and Warlords Collude</h3>
<p>Madly Calling for Withdrawal of Humiliating Diplomacy</p>
<p>Strongly Advocating Immediate Withdrawal from the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Whenever the Ministry of Foreign Affairs faces a crisis, it invariably resorts to threatening propaganda, claiming that it will withdraw from the League of Nations. In reality, the domestic economy is empty and cannot withstand isolation, much less expanded military operations. Therefore, it has been repeatedly restrained by senior ministers, elders, and the financial community, and continues to appease the League of Nations. Young diplomats within the ministry have expressed great dissatisfaction. Now that the League of Nations' questions have been received, they have seized the opportunity to start activities, colluding with young military officers, attempting to use the power of the military to force the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to withdraw from the League of Nations. It is reported that hardliners from both the military and foreign ministries have been in close contact today, secretly discussing ways to proceed. Their future developments are highly noteworthy. (China United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The young and middle-aged members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the Committee of Nineteen's questions, said that they completely disregarded Japan's opinion on the Lytton Report and its new proposal, trampled on Japan's fundamental policy of recognizing "Manchukuo," and could not remain silent. They are echoing the young and middle-aged members of the military, strongly advocating the withdrawal of humiliating diplomacy and immediately withdrawing from the League of Nations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' leadership is also paying close attention to this movement. (Domei News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Committee of Nineteen's request for a clear and precise answer from Japan regarding the recognition of "Manchukuo" has aroused indignation within the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the League of Nations is pretending not to understand Japan's attitude towards "Manchukuo," which is a deliberate insult to Japan. Japan cannot compromise on this fundamental issue, as Japan firmly believes that the existence of "Manchukuo" is necessary for peace in the Far East. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Conflict Inevitable, Japanese Stock Market Plummets</h3>
<p>Osaka: Japan's final compromise proposal was deliberated by the Committee of Nineteen yesterday. The Japanese business community is extremely concerned about the future of the League of Nations. Especially after the Japanese Ministry of the Army issued a statement on the invasion of Jehol yesterday at noon, the business community speculated that a head-on collision between Japan and the League of Nations was unavoidable, causing a sharp drop in the stock market. The price of old shares fell 80 sen, and new shares fell 1 yen and 60 sen, reflecting the true situation. (China United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Spread Rumors</h3>
<p>That Chen Youren is in Paris</p>
<p>Concluding a Military Alliance with Russia</p>
<p>Both China and Russia Deny the Falsehood</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese government today fabricated another major rumor, claiming to have received unofficial news that Chen Youren had discussed the conclusion of a Sino-Russian alliance treaty with the Soviet Russian Ambassador to France while in Paris recently. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>After the Japanese government spokesperson issued this strange news today, a reporter from the National News Agency visited Mr. Chen Youren, who is currently in Shanghai, and told him about this claim. Chen Youren reportedly said that the Japanese are seeing ghosts everywhere, and this claim is absolutely untrue and completely unfounded.</p>
<p>(Moscow) It has been formally denied here that Chen Youren had contacted the Russian Embassy in Paris to discuss a mutual defense alliance, as reported by Tokyo. Informed sources said that the Japanese fabricated the claim of a Sino-Russian trade agreement just a week ago, which was denied here. Now they are making groundless claims again, which is like adding fuel to the fire and increasing Soviet Russia's annoyance. These unfortunate events will give Moscow the most unpleasant impression.</p>
<p>(National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, a semi-official Russian source here stated that the rumors circulating in Tokyo that Chen Youren had discussed the conclusion of a Sino-Russian alliance treaty at the Russian Embassy in Paris are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>China's chief representative to the League of Nations, the newly appointed Ambassador to Russia, Guo Taiqi, also solemnly stated that Chen Youren does not hold any official position in the Chinese National Government. Friends of Chen Youren also said that although Chen had been to Paris during his time in Europe, he is an opponent of the current government, and even if he had made such a proposal, it could only be considered a private proposal, which could only mature after Chen Youren held power. The Japanese claim is absolutely suspicious.</p>
<p>According to reports, Chen Youren returned to China from Italy on the 11th of last month. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Tokyo released the rumor that Chen Youren had discussed a military alliance at the Russian Embassy, both the Chinese and Russian embassies here refuted the rumor. Not only did they deny it, but they also severely criticized the Japanese for their specialized rumor-mongering, pointing out that Chen Youren had not been to France for several months. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese legation, no member of the Chinese legation had ever been to the Soviet Russian Embassy, nor had they received instructions from the government to contact Soviet Russia regarding any treaty. Furthermore, a spokesperson for the Soviet Russian Embassy stated that the origin of the claim proves that it is fabricated. Such a treaty would directly violate Soviet Russian foreign policy. The Russian government's policy seeks only to conclude friendship and non-aggression treaties and rejects all military alliances. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Provoke on the East Bank of the Shi River</h3>
<p>Japanese Cavalry Suddenly Charged Towards the Shi River Bridge Last Night</p>
<p>They Retreated After Our Sentries Swept with Machine Guns</p>
<p>Zheng Guilin's Troops are Actively Operating Outside of Jiukou</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops on the east bank of the Shi River are constantly waving white flags to provoke our troops. Last night at 8:00 PM, Japanese cavalry charged towards the Shi River Bridge. They retreated after our sentries on the west bank swept with machine guns. The Shi River front line immediately became tense. Three armored trains are parked at the Yuguan station. (Transmitted telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Linyu: It is widely rumored in Yuguan that Japanese troops plan to launch a large-scale invasion westward on the 15th. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Linyu: The volunteer army of Zheng Guilin's troops outside of Jiukou is operating in three directions towards Suizhong, Xingcheng, and Qianwei. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Linyu: The puppet state has established telegraph and postal bureaus in Yuguan, as well as a radio station, to facilitate military communications. (Telegram, 10th) (Beiping) Japanese troops in Yuguan are inspecting civilian houses day and night. Dozens of 14-cm cannons have been installed on the west gate of the city. (Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is no contact at Shi River. There are battles in the Yong'anbao area outside Jiukou. The volunteer army of Zheng Guilin's troops is in constant contact with the Japanese troops. Two Japanese warships are still anchored in the Qinhuangdao waters. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, the Japanese troops stationed in Yuguan demanded dozens of civilians from the city's Public Security Bureau to go to the Japanese barracks at the Fourth Fort to construct fortifications. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Main Force of Japanese Troops Advances Towards Kailu</h3>
<h3>People of Kailu Flee to Chengde</h3>
<p>Large Number of Japanese Troops Arrive at Suizhong from Jinzhou</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed the Central Government on the 8th, stating that the righteous armies and militias in various parts of Rehe Province are willing to defend the territory alongside the National Army and coexist with Rehe. Their righteous indignation is high. Currently, all righteous armies in Rehe have changed their names to Self-Defense Righteous Armies to show that the people are resisting Japan for self-defense, etc. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Commander Cui telegraphed Tang Yulin this morning, reporting that Motegi's cavalry brigade had arrived in Tongliao. A portion of them, aboard many heavy trucks, are advancing towards Kailu. Three Japanese aircraft flew over Kailu County City at noon on the 9th for reconnaissance. Japanese aircraft often follow and bomb our long-distance buses traveling between Kailu, Chaoyang, and Chengde. The people of Kailu are all fleeing to Chengde for refuge. There are no changes in Fuxin, only Yu Zhishan's troops are digging trenches and defensive works near Fuxin, preparing to attack the city. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Ziting, Commander of the Rehe Righteous Army, telegraphed on the 9th that 1,500 Japanese troops launched a fierce artillery attack on our Qilihezi defense area this morning. Our entire army resisted. Subsequently, Xie Guochen, Commander of the Third Brigade of Liu Zhendong's Fifth Army Corps, led a force of over a thousand to reinforce.

Now, the ward is the smallest unit, which is too large and unsuitable for clearing household registration and organizing baojia. Moreover, the population standard for setting up a city is over 300,000, which is too strict and should be changed to over 100,000. No resolution was reached.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>General Ding Chao Captured - Forbearance</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch: "Anti-Japanese leader General Ding Chao was captured in Jiamusi nine days ago. Japanese officers transported him by military aircraft to Harbin, and he will soon be sent to Changchun for trial, likely facing the death penalty." This news is even more tragic than General Ma Zhanshan's defeat and the retreat of General Su Bingwen and Li Du's troops into Soviet territory. What are the feelings of the Chinese people upon hearing this devastating news?</p>
<p>Since General Ding rose up in Harbin last January, uniting with General Li Du to raise the banner of anti-Japanese resistance, his telegram stated, "Sharing the enemy's hatred, we will not turn back. Success or failure is not what we anticipate." His impassioned words were resolute as iron, his spirit as grand as mountains and rivers, his righteousness reaching the clouds. He had long resolved to fight to the death for survival. Therefore, since the uprising, he has fought arduously, never wavering in his resolve, and even winning surprising victories, repeatedly defeating powerful enemies. Today, although he has unfortunately been captured and may face a brutal death, he dies for the nation, for justice, and for resistance against tyranny. Seeking benevolence and attaining it, General Ding can calmly face death. Moreover, his death is as heavy as mountains and can move heaven and earth and make ghosts weep.</p>
<p>However, more than a year has passed since the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident, and the seizure of power throughout the country remains as deliberate as ever, the disputes over ego remain as persistent as ever, and the intoxication and complacency with fleeting peace remain as prevalent as ever. What is worse is that while the Northeast Volunteer Army was fighting hard against a powerful enemy, internal chaos erupted in our country, with the Lu Rebellion, the Guangdong Rebellion, the Sichuan Rebellion, and the Guizhou Rebellion following one after another. The strong enemy entered our house, and internal wars continued to rage while we watched the volunteer army fighting arduously in the black mountains and white waters, unwilling to offer even an arrow's worth of support. General Ma Zhanshan was defeated, and General Su Bingwen and Li Du also retreated into Soviet territory one after another. Now General Ding has also been captured. Under the power of an invincible enemy, in a state of exhaustion of ammunition and lack of support, the volunteer army may eventually be individually defeated by the brutal enemy. However, the volunteer army can certainly account to our nation, and they can certainly account to us, the Chinese people. On the contrary, how will the Chinese people face the Northeast Volunteer Army? How will the millions of troops who eat the food of the people, wear the clothes of the people, and receive the support of the people, yet are unable to resist insults and unable to defend against enemies, face the Northeast Volunteer Army?</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spring snow in Shanghai was chilling to the bone. The bitter cold in the borderlands, with icy skies and snowy earth, causes fingers to drop off and skin to crack. The volunteer army endures hunger and cold, risking their lives. Their hardship is beyond what we can imagine. However, the gentlemen and ladies of Shanghai happened to hold a tea dance party to provide relief to Northeast refugees. Before the champagne glasses, under the bright red lights, they leaned against each other, danced, and swayed together. The lights were bright, the wine was green, and the music was decadent. The room was warm, and everyone was happy. At this time, can anyone still remember the icy skies and snowy earth of the Northeast? Can anyone still remember the volunteer army fighting hard in the icy skies and snowy earth? We sincerely dare not believe it. When national disaster strikes, and the crisis of survival is imminent, those with strength contribute strength, and those with wealth contribute wealth. This is the most appropriate time, yet one must "save the country" through "entertainment." This is truly "the courtesan does not know the hatred of a fallen nation, still singing 'Flowers of the Courtyard' across the river." If the volunteer army knew this, how could they not cry to the heavens?</p>
<p>Alas, he died before his mission was accomplished, forever causing heroes to weep with tears filling their sleeves. The Blackwater River flows endlessly, with boundless regret. General Ding has now been captured, and he may ultimately face death. However, how will we comfort General Ding? Let the Chinese people think about it, think about it again.</p>

<h3>Pu Tangshi Xia Unwilling to be a Puppet Emperor's Relative</h3>
<p>(Beijing) The brother's wife of the puppet Pu Yi, Pu Tangshi Xia, namely Pu Jie's wife, sent a long letter to Beijing yesterday, detailing the family affairs. A certain former Qing noble intended to reconcile Pu Tangshi Xia with her son, Pu Jie, to avoid wandering abroad. Pu Tangshi Xia replied, stating that she did not want to reunite with Pu Jie for the following reasons: Xia and her husband had a very good relationship. Since he went to Japan to study, for several years, Xia has been trapped in Beijing. The servants have been deliberately causing trouble, and her father-in-law has been listening to slander, and there has often been idle talk. Xia cannot feel at ease. Pu Yi was abducted by the Japanese, and Xia pleaded and strongly advised her father-in-law before it happened, but her father-in-law accused Xia of being nosy. Xia had no choice but to leave the mansion alone, preferring to be a wandering soul of China, rather than a relative of a puppet emperor. Therefore, going to Changchun is impossible. If her husband considers the plea of his wife, he should come to Shanghai to be with Xia. Xia will work for him and make connections, and it will not be difficult for him to have a foothold. Otherwise, once he fails, they will both be discredited and reviled by future generations, and there will be no place for them to stand in the country or abroad. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Suggestion to Promote the British Minister to China to Ambassador</h3>

<p>This Move Could Win Over the Chinese</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: The Daily Telegraph today carries an article by Mr. Green, a former British resident of Shanghai, suggesting that the British Minister to China should be promoted to Ambassador.

<h3>Japan Greatly Panicked by the Boycott of Japanese Goods in China</h3>
<p>Decision to Submit International Prohibition Proposal</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th: The Economic League held a standing committee meeting at the Industrial Club yesterday to discuss the proposals that the Japanese Committee should submit to the International Chamber of Commerce Congress to be held in Vienna, Austria on May 29th. As a result of the discussion, in light of the experience of China's boycott of Japanese goods, it was decided to submit an international resolution prohibiting boycotts of goods. The main points are as follows: Recently, boycotts of foreign goods have been based on political and diplomatic grounds in the Orient, causing the greatest obstacles to international trade. This not only has the worst impact on the nations involved but also disrupts peace between the countries and the world, which is intolerable. We hope that all countries in the world will eliminate the boycott of foreign goods as soon as possible. The International Chamber of Commerce, as the largest and most authoritative group of industrialists in the world, should take the lead in seeking the most effective methods to achieve this goal, which is an urgent matter. We hope that in the future, when concluding or revising treaties of commerce between two countries, clauses to suppress boycotts of goods should be included, and even further, the prohibition of boycotts of goods should be stipulated by international treaties.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Passes Budget Bill</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th: The House of Representatives held budget subcommittee meetings this morning, passing the various motions. At 2:17 PM, the budget general assembly was held.

Next, Nishiwaki Susumu from the Minseito read out the resolution considering the streamlining of fiscal and tax policies and the hopes of the Seiyukai, also giving a speech in favor. Finally, Kato Kanichi from the Kokumin Domei rose and said that this budget bill is contrary to the policies of the National Alliance and therefore requires a revision, but under such a current government, this is impossible, so he had to agree with the budget due to the principle that the budget cannot be divided. After the discussion ended, at the time of voting, except for the Proletarian Party's Sugiyama Motoharu, it was passed unanimously. The meeting adjourned at 2:55 PM.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 10th: The Seiyukai, which has a majority in the House of Representatives, held a meeting yesterday and decided to support the budget bill but submitted several petitions requesting streamlined national defense administration and tax system and the establishment of a stable financial policy. In order to stabilize exchange rates, establish low-interest loans, and facilitate the circulation of the yen, basic industrial policies should be formulated. Furthermore, economic cooperation should be sought between Japan and Manchukuo. The Minseito party affairs meeting also decided yesterday to support the budget bill.</p>

<h3>The Entire United States Enraged: Lindbergh Receives Another Kidnapping Threatening Letter</h3>
<p>His Eldest Son's Death Remains Unresolved for Nearly a Year</p>
<p>His Second Son Now Receives Threats</p>
<p>(Reuters, Roanoke, Virginia, 9th) Famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh has received a threatening letter regarding the kidnapping of his six-month-old second son. Less than a year after the tragic loss of his eldest son, Lindbergh is again subjected to such threats. The entire nation is outraged upon hearing this news. Today, two individuals have been apprehended, accused of threatening Lindbergh with the kidnapping of his second son and demanding $50,000. After receiving the letter, Lindbergh immediately reported it to the police. Following the instructions in the letter, the police placed a check for $17,000 in a hollow in a nearby tree. Several days ago, someone attempted to cash this check at a bank and was apprehended this morning. An accomplice was also caught. Both individuals deny the charges.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Trenton, New Jersey, 10th) According to the New Jersey State Police Chief today, the threat to kidnap Lindbergh's second son is unrelated to the murder of his eldest son.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference Sparks Widespread Panic</h3>
<p>Strong Criticism from All Sides Towards France</p>
<p>British Plan Begins Debate</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 9th The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference met this afternoon to debate the British disarmament plan. British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Anthony Eden spoke first, stating that the progress of the Disarmament Conference was as slow as an ox's pace, causing widespread panic. If concrete results are not achieved within the next few weeks, the conference risks becoming deadlocked.</p>
<p>Therefore, the British government has specifically put forward concrete suggestions as a touchstone for the conference. Eden continued to discuss naval disarmament, saying that the discussions among the naval powers so far have been merely negative. He also said that the British government intends to spare no effort to achieve a</p>
<h3>Basic Agreement</h3>
<p>The second speaker, German representative Nadolny, stated that the German government welcomes all suggestions that facilitate the work of the Disarmament Conference. However, it opposes any plan that would prolong disarmament negotiations. Nadolny went on to criticize the Disarmament Conference for being too slow to conclude and for the suggestion that effective disarmament</p>
<h3>Need Not Require Universal Consent</h3>
<p>Nadolny welcomed the British proposal, stating that all countries should</p>
<h3>Abandon Deceit</h3>
<p>And clearly state their attitude towards disarmament, especially the attitude of the Five-Power Pact, which grants Germany equal status, is now at hand. French representative Paul-Boncour then spoke, stating that</p>
<h3>The Five-Power Pact</h3>
<p>Does not bind the Disarmament Conference. He is willing to discuss it, but must declare that allowing Germany equal status can only be achieved within a framework of security. Due to today's debate,</p>
<h3>Many Rumors</h3>
<p>Have arisen, claiming that the British government is currently planning to convene a Five-Power Conference to facilitate disarmament discussions. British circles here say that the current debate will not lead to other matters. The Disarmament Conference's desire for success depends on the complete harmony of the Five Powers first.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 9th British representative Lord Cecil told a reporter from Le Petit Marseillais today that France must choose between reducing its own armaments or increasing Germany's armaments. Lord Cecil's remarks on France's disarmament proposals</p>
<h3>Strongly Criticized</h3>
<p>He said that if France is willing to reduce its instruments of aggressive warfare, it would greatly benefit the world. If</p>
<h3>France Realizes</h3>
<p>Its lack of international sympathy, it should realize that it is due to its own misunderstanding and ambiguity regarding its attitude towards disarmament. Lord Cecil stated that Britain will oppose Germany's proposal to amend the treaty at the Disarmament Conference, as the Disarmament Conference does not discuss issues other than disarmament.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 9th The organ of the National Socialist Party is extremely indignant at Paul-Boncour's speech in Geneva the other day regarding France's disarmament plan. Paul-Boncour's speech stated that although most countries oppose France's disarmament plan, France still believes that its plan is the best. The newspaper said that, viewed in this way, it is clear that France is unwilling to sincerely reduce armaments or allow Germany to have equal armaments. France's disarmament plan was explained at the Geneva Disarmament Conference on November 4 last year. The plan advocated the organization of a strong international air force to assist the League of Nations in quickly providing relief to countries under attack. The plan also stipulated that all countries should gradually abolish all standing armies, except for a small number for self-defense and assistance to the League of Nations, and advocated that countries that support this proposal should reduce their troop numbers and shorten the duration of military training.</p>

<p>National News, Berlin, 9th Most German newspapers have expressed surprise, shock and indignation at the recent claim by former French Premier and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French Parliament, Édouard Herriot, that a secret alliance exists between Germany, Italy, and Hungary. Moreover, Herriot himself has stated that the existence of such an alliance has</p>
<p>lacks evidence. Therefore, the Berlin Local Indicator newspaper declared that the former French Premier's unfounded allegations are clearly</p>
<p>To cover up domestic political difficulties, this theory was fabricated to conceal them. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung claimed that Herriot's</p>
<p>言, according to inquiries from reliable sources in Germany, is completely unfounded and only increases tensions between the two countries. The purpose is nothing more than an excuse for France's unwillingness to reduce armaments.</p>
<p>▲National News, Paris, 10th The newspaper L'Ordre reported that the Italian ambassador yesterday, following instructions from his government, visited French Premier Daladier to forcefully deny the</p>
<p>Alliance between Italy, Germany, and Hungary, as alleged by French Premier Herriot in the Foreign Affairs Committee of Parliament.</p>
<p>説, on the German side, has also been officially</p>
<p>實ly denied.</p>
<h3>Germany Greatly Increases Tariffs</h3>
<p>Protecting Agriculture, Preventing Dumping</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 9th The German government today ordered a significant increase in tax rates to protect agriculture and prevent the dumping of foreign products. This is the policy advocated by the National People's Party and its leader, current Minister of Economy Alfred Hugenberg.

<h3>The United States Does Not Want a Mussolini</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Authority to Reorganize the Executive Branch</p>
<p>National News, Washington, 9th After the US Congress passed the Government Economy Act last year, President Hoover proposed a plan to reorganize the executive branch, consolidate parallel branches, and eliminate redundant personnel. However, it was recently rejected by the Democratic-majority Congress. The US Senate passed another Government Economy Act, granting President-elect Roosevelt even greater authority to freely reorganize the executive branch. As long as it is within the scope of reducing government spending, the President can act expediently without seeking congressional approval. If Congress wants to veto it, it must have a two-thirds majority vote. It is now expected that the House of Representatives will also pass this new bill. However, the Republican side has already reacted strongly, claiming that granting President-elect Roosevelt unlimited power to reorganize the executive branch would be tantamount to creating a dictator, and the United States does not want a Mussolini.</p>
<h3>Rural Panic in the Midwest Worsens</h3>
<p>National News, Chicago, 9th Rural panic in the American Midwest is worsening. Farmers fear that their blood, sweat, and fields will be confiscated by creditors. There have been expressions of not hesitating to riot and shed blood to protest the implementation of mortgage laws. In light of this crisis, several states are considering temporary relief measures. Iowa has passed a state law allowing state courts to postpone mortgage foreclosure cases until March 1 of next year. It is reported that the legislative assemblies of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and other Midwestern states are also considering similar legislation.</p>
<h3>Blizzard Disaster, 65 Dead</h3>

The loss of livestock and other property is enormous. Detailed disaster information cannot be accurately known until several days later due to the disruption of telegraphs and the blockage of major roads in various places.</p>
<h3>San Pedro Port to Build Naval Base</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 9th According to news from San Pedro Port in the United States, the US State Department has decided to investigate whether the port can be rebuilt as a naval base. If it can be rebuilt, the entire US fleet can be accommodated. It is now heard that US Navy Commander Admiral Leigh is advocating the immediate purchase of a portion of the port for rebuilding.

<h3>Japan Arrests Anti-War Activists</h3>
<p>Pan-Cooperative System Conspires to Anti-War Demonstrations</p>
<p>More Than 100 Intellectuals Arrested</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, Pan-Cooperative System elements, with Suwa, Ina, and Matsumoto in Nagano Prefecture as their center, originally planned to hold large-scale demonstrations against imperialist war on the National Foundation Day commemorating the eighth Emperor Jimmu. However, due to</p>
<p>A lack of secrecy, the police department detected it. The police stations were mobilized to search various residences and confiscate evidence documents. More than a hundred people were arrested, mostly from the intellectual class, such as Kyuda and Fukuoka, science students at Matsumoto High School, and dozens of female workers at silk mills. Others were youth association cadres, women's association officers, printing workers, vocational school teachers, and elementary school instructors. Students from Waseda University also were included. These people all aimed to oppose imperialist war and were</p>
<p>organizational groups. The most shocking thing is that within the silk mills nationwide, the supervisors, through female workers, secretly incited all 80,000 female workers and conspired to turn them red, preparing to riot simultaneously on National Foundation Day.</p>
<h3>Puppet State Officials are Replaced with Japanese</h3>
<p>Personnel Departments are Established in All Puppet Ministries</p>
<p>Patriots in the Northeast Exist Only in the Business Community</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Recently, Japanese officials in the puppet state have become more numerous than those of the puppet Manchurian state. All positions above the second rank in each ministry have been replaced by Japanese. Every day, the puppet state issues commissions to at least a dozen people. Apart from awards and promotions, there is almost nothing else. A consul from a certain country, who recently arrived in Changchun from Harbin, stated that according to his investigation, there are 137 Japanese serving in the puppet State Council and 64 puppet Manchurian people. In the puppet Ministry of Finance, there are 171 Japanese and 44 puppet people. Within the puppet Ministry of Civil Affairs, there are 69 Japanese and 90 puppet people. Within the puppet Ministry of Communications, there are 270 Japanese and 86 puppet people. The puppet Ministry of Justice has 42 Japanese and 57 puppet people. Within the puppet Ministry of Military Affairs, there are 40 Japanese and 56 puppet people. In the other puppet ministries, there are more Japanese than puppet people. Moreover, in each ministry, there used to be so-called personnel departments only in the puppet State Council and the puppet Ministry of Finance. Now, all ministries and provincial offices have established personnel departments specifically for personnel</p>
<p>allocation and qualification assessment. They will not be employed unless the Japanese side believes that they will not oppose the puppet state. The personnel departments of each ministry are subordinate to the General Affairs Division or the General Affairs Department. The personnel departments of each provincial office are directly under the jurisdiction of the Director of the General Affairs Department. The heads of the General Affairs Division and the General Affairs Department are all Japanese. The organization of the department and the division is generally six sections. In addition to the Personnel Section, there are the Accounting Section and the General Affairs Section. The chiefs of the six sections are also all Japanese. Previously, the leaders of each province and department, in addition to their salaries, could receive some office expenses. Most leaders could manipulate the office expenses. Now, even a piece of paper or a pen must be obtained from the General Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department. If they spend a little more each month, they will be rebuked by the section chief. Therefore, the puppet ministers, department heads, and chiefs receive no benefits other than their salaries. The employment of personnel in each ministry is handled by the Director of the General Affairs Division, and the ministers of the ministry have no right to interfere. The situation in each province is better, but according to its system, if the governor wants to employ someone, he must submit a list, which is handed over to the Director of the General Affairs Department for review. The Director of the General Affairs Department then orders the head of the Personnel Section to investigate, and then submit it to the provincial government meeting. The Director of the General Affairs Department approves or rejects it. Often, a list of dozens of people results in only two or three being approved after their review. However, the issuance of orders must still be submitted to the puppet ministry by the Director of the General Affairs Department, and the personnel section of the responsible ministry must review it again. If they consider it usable, then they will approve the appointment. The puppet state is now vigorously recruiting</p>
<p>Those who were once so-called patriots who ran parties in the Northeast, using their spirit of advocating and calling for the Three Principles of the People, to propagandize the puppet state's Kingly Way Doctrine. Those shameless traitors only know profit and desire, losing their original features, and actually propagandizing for the puppet state. For example, Wang Binyang, the former Standing Committee member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Department, is serving as a Pacification Commissioner in the puppet Heilongjiang Provincial Office, going to various places to publicize that the righteous army is a bandit. Chen Weiruo, the former Secretary-General of the Harbin City Party Department, is serving as a Colonel Section Chief in the puppet Ministry of Military Affairs, and recently also served as an Inspector of the Education Department of the Eastern Provinces Special District. Zhang Shuping and Shi Yongjun, propaganda group cadres of the City Party Department who worked with Chen, are now Director of Investigation in the puppet Special District Garrison, contacting the Japanese Military Police every day to search for so-called reactionaries and send them to the military police to be flogged by the Japanese. One is running around the gates of the puppet state's dignitaries,</p>
<p>to repay their desire for promotion and wealth. The other general party members</p>
<p>也 have many despicable behaviors, even some that ordinary pig herders would disdain to do. Those guys also treat it as an iron job. Therefore, if you want to find patriots in the Northeast now, they are not in the education community, not in the military, but in the business and industrial circles. Because now only the business and industrial circles hope for the restoration of the country and secretly engage in patriotic movements. (February 2)</p>
<h3>Chengdu and Chongqing Still Confront Each Other</h3>
<p>Liu, Tian, and Deng Join Forces to Resist Liu Xiang</p>
<p>Liu, Yang, and Others Confer to Divide Territories</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Since the armistice of the Sichuan War, it could have ceased hostilities. However, in fact, there are still significant changes brewing, as Chengdu and Chongqing have become confrontational. Initially, Liu Wenhui and Liu Xiang, after signing a non-aggression treaty, concentrated their troops and telegraphed to return to the province. At that time, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and Liu Wenhui could have had a conflict. Fortunately, elders in the provincial capital and generals of the Bao clique came forward to mediate and negotiate terms. The armies of Deng, Tian, and Liu then resumed cooperation. All provincial organs of Liu's army were returned by Tian Songyao. Tian, forced by circumstances, and because Tian's army had suffered great losses since the outbreak of the Sichuan War, while Liu Xiang had expanded his territory to more than 20 counties, and Yang Sen, Li Jiayu, and Luo Zezhou had also gained considerable benefits, deeply regretted his recklessness in being fooled by Liu Xiang. Therefore, he tried his best to express goodwill to Liu Wenhui and welcomed him back to the province. On the 24th of last month, Liu Wenhui returned to Chengdu. After Deng, Tian, and Liu met, they were not ashamed of going back and forth. Liu Wenhui was even willing to cede the position of Chairman of the Provincial Government to Tian Songyao. In addition to already telegraphing to the Central Government to resign, he also jointly guaranteed Tian's succession with Deng Xihou. Therefore, Liu, Tian, and Deng have gone from division to unity again.</p>
<p>On the Chongqing side, Liu Xiang believed that now that the war had ended, a meeting should be convened to discuss the future of Sichuan and the territories occupied by the allied forces. On the 3rd, a formal meeting was held in Chongqing. Those attending were Liu Xiang, commander of the 21st Army, division commanders Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, Fan Shaozeng, Wang Zuanxu, Yang Sen, commander of the 20th Army, Li Jiayu, commander of the New Sixth Division, and Luo Zezhou, commander of the 23rd Division, and more than 30 others. The first item on the agenda was the division of the territories occupied by the 24th Army. It was resolved that Nanchong and Wusheng counties would be assigned to Yang Sen, Suining, Fengxi, Zizhong, and Anyue counties would be assigned to Li Jiayu, and Tongnan and Lezhi would be assigned to Luo Zezhou. On the 4th, the meeting continued to discuss the establishment of the Sichuan Post-War Commission and the selection of candidates for Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and directors of each department. After pre-determination, Liu Xiang was the Chairman of the Post-War Commission, Yang Sen or Tian Songyao was the Vice-Chairman. As a result, Yang Sen politely declined, so Tian Songyao was decided, and Yang Sen was the Director of the Military Affairs Department, Deng Xihou was the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Liu Wenhui was the Director of the Construction Department, Li Jiayu was the Director of the Finance Department, Liu Cunhou was the Director of the Industry Department, Wang Luji was the Director of the Education Department, and most people recommended Zhang Qun as the Dean of the Supervisory Yuan. The above are all general decisions, pending the formal establishment of the Post-War Commission before making a final decision. In the afternoon, the cases discussed were the suppression of the Reds. Liu Xiang advocated dividing the areas for suppression, with each responsible for suppressing the Red bandits within his own defense zone. Yang Sen advocated not dividing the boundaries, but unanimously uniting and suppressing to eliminate them as soon as possible. As a result, Yang's proposal was passed. On the 5th, Liu Xiang and Yang Sen both sent teams to Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, Nanbu, and other places to assist Tian Songyao in suppressing the Red bandits. However, Tian is naturally suspicious. When the Central Army entered Sichuan to suppress the bandits, he deliberately obstructed it, vainly hoping to preserve his private defense zone. Now that Liu and Yang have sent troops into his defense zone to suppress bandits, it is feared that Tian will have another misunderstanding. (February 5)</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Borrows Money to Build Roads</h3>
<p>Constructing the Changhong Light Railway</p>
<p>Borrowing a Total of 50 Million from the United Kingdom</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hongjiang is the largest commercial port upstream of western Hunan. The annual export value of tung oil, wood, tallow, etc., produced there is tens of millions of dollars. Goods produced in Guizhou are also concentrated in Hongjiang and transshipped for export. However, land and water transportation are not very convenient, and the transportation of goods is extremely difficult. When Tan Yankai presided over Hunan's politics, he initiated the construction of the Changhong (Changsha to Hongjiang) motor road. More than ten years have passed, and it has not yet been completed. Last year, during the Double Ten Festival, Hunan welcomed Chinese and foreign experts to Hunan to visit and test gas vehicles. After the visit, Mr. An Lide, the American Commercial Counselor, made a vow to assist in the development of Hunan's construction industry and introduced the following two major enterprises: (1) Introduced Hunan Province to order 180 cars from Ford Motor Company in the United States, delivering 10 cars per month, completing delivery in one and a half years. One-third of the price will be paid when the cars arrive in Changsha, and the remaining amount will be repaid in installments within three years. (2) He introduced Mr. Freeman, General Manager of the British Investment Company in China, to Hunan to invest in the construction of the Changhong Light Railway. At that time, He Jian expressed his great welcome. In January of this year, Mr. Freeman arrived in Shanghai from England, and Mr. An Lide telegraphed He Jian to send someone to Shanghai to discuss everything. He Jian and Tan Changkai, Director of the Construction Department, and the members of the provincial government discussed the outline of the road construction, (1) The route of the light railway starts from Changsha, passes through Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Baoqing, and Hongjiang, and then passes through Yuanling, Changde, and Yiyang to reach Changsha, forming a network. (2) The light railway must be connected to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to realize intermodal transportation so that the products of Hunan and Guizhou provinces can be transported to Guangdong, Guangxi, and the provinces along the Yangtze River. (3) The light railway is a total of 2,000 li long, and each li requires 25,000 yuan, for a total of 50 million yuan in national currency. The full amount is borrowed from British merchants. (4) The loan is guaranteed by the Changhong Light Railway, and the principal and interest are repaid in installments from the road's income. The above method is to utilize foreign capital to develop the transportation industry. After the method was determined, Wang Huixian, an engineering expert and current Director of the Hunan Water Conservancy Survey Corps, was sent to Shanghai to represent the province. Introduced by An Lide,</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman was contacted. Mr. Freeman expressed his approval of the four measures set by Hunan Province, but attached two additional conditions: First, the 50 million yuan loan for the construction of the Changhong Light Railway must first be reported by the Hunan Provincial Government to the Central Government for approval and filing. Second, the chief engineer must be British, and all materials and vehicles should be purchased from British goods as soon as possible. Wang Huixian considered it feasible and returned to Hunan last week to report. He Jian and others decided to actively proceed with telegraphing to invite Mr. Freeman to Hunan to discuss and sign the contract in person. Mr. Freeman has already replied by telegram and is scheduled to come</p>
<p>矣 in early March. (February 5)</p>
<h3>Wuxi Actively Prepares for the Establishment of a Local Branch Court</h3>
<p>Yang Keqian, the President of the County Court of Wuxi, was ordered to be transferred to the position of Chief Judge of the Linqing Branch Court of the Jining District Court in Shandong Province. The vacancy was filled by Xu Tizhang, the President of the Yiwu County Court in Zhejiang Province. Mr. Xu has not yet arrived in Wuxi, but amidst the transfer rumors,</p>
<p>院, the President of the Court is still actively proceeding with the expansion of the local branch court. Recently, he recompiled the budget for this project and detailed the necessity of expanding the local branch court in this county. The recurring expenses can be maintained according to the situation in Wuxi. Yesterday, President Yang specially submitted the above plan to the High Court, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for verification and instructions.</p>
<h3>Saving Sericulture: Please Restore the County Agricultural Station</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry, by order, dissolved the Wuxi County Agricultural Station, leading to the cessation of various agricultural and sericultural affairs. Subsequently, individuals from the sericulture industry, including Lu Zirong, Xue Shouxuan of the silk industry, and Qian Fenghao, stated that Wuxi's silk production had historically been the center of the province. However, due to recent pressure from Japanese silk and a lack of improvements, it had suffered a significant decline. They emphasized the necessity of providing relief and revitalization. Last year, the County Agricultural Station implemented a rescue effort, collaborating with the sericulture industry to establish forty guidance stations in the four rural districts, yielding considerable success and initiating advancements in sericulture. It was originally planned for this spring, drawing over nine thousand eight hundred yuan from the county's industrial funds, to cooperate with the sericulture industry to improve common silkworm rearing rooms in the rural districts and jointly operate sixty guidance centers, promoting the planting of one hundred thousand mulberry saplings, advocating for the replanting of old mulberry trees, establishing model mulberry gardens, and, to cultivate grassroots sericulture talent in various rural districts, recruiting female silkworm rearers and providing classes to teach sericulture skills. Since the closure of the Agricultural Station, sericulture has completely stagnated, with significant impacts on the social economy. With early spring already here and the silkworm season approaching rapidly, continued efforts are urgently needed. Therefore, they jointly submitted a request to be treated like the Zhenjiang example and to continue operations. The Provincial Department instructed the County Government to conduct a comprehensive review before approving the continuation. However, Lu and others believed that time was pressing and could not be delayed. Yesterday, they submitted a request approved by the County Government to the Provincial Department, seeking immediate restoration to facilitate improvements.</p>

<h3>Luo's Remarks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, during his meeting with reporters from various newspapers, Minister Luo spoke about the past shortcomings in the judiciary and his views on future reforms. Luo first stated that there had been much criticism in the foreign press regarding the unsatisfactory state of the Special District Court, generally citing the following points: (1) excessive delays in execution; (2) excessive use of the right to appeal; (3) excessively complicated ordinary procedures; (4) insufficient understanding of commercial customs, etc. However, since taking office as the Minister of Justice, he felt that this situation was not unique to Shanghai, but was common throughout the country, where no one could honestly claim to be satisfied. Since the Maguan Treaty of 1902, Chinese law had been reformed to implement the rule of law, but it had completely adopted the continental system, placing too much emphasis on ideals without deeply considering whether it conformed to the actual situation. In Shanghai, where there are many continental expatriates, the majority are British and American. British and American law is simpler and more direct, so British and American expatriates are naturally even less satisfied. However, this type of law works well in Europe because its detailed provisions, such as investigation law, registration law, bankruptcy law, etc., are sufficient to remedy its defects. China's facilities are incomplete, yet it emulates others, which is like seeing someone dancing in a Yiyuan dance hall in the dead of winter, half-naked and ethereal, while we, without the same facilities, directly emulate them. Not only will we not be happy, but we may also become ill. Therefore, simply wearing a Western suit and thinking that one has learned the wonderful ways of others is not as suitable as wearing winter fur in winter and summer linen in summer. When he was in the Beijing government, he worked with Mr. Wang Chonghui to establish criminal laws and other legal systems, which at the time were mostly focused on scientific aspects, and he considered them satisfactory. However, after being in prison for a year, the experience gained during that year made him realize that the laws he had previously formulated were full of flaws and entirely unsatisfactory. From this, one knows that there is a great difference between ideals and experience, and that ancient Chinese law was not without its merits. As long as it is based on facts, it can achieve good results. For example, in the past, people emphasized the rule of man, and murderers often stepped forward to pay with their lives, maintaining a heroic spirit. Today, we emphasize the rule of law, but many people are cunning and disregard morality. He believes that cars can only be driven on asphalt roads; driving them on muddy ground will only lead to obstruction and make it impossible to drive. He also believes that governing with punishment is not as good as governing with righteousness.</p>
<h3>Reforming the Legal System</h3>
<p>Luo expressed that regarding the recent shortcomings in the legal system and the suffering of prisoners in prison, he had personally experienced these situations after being imprisoned for over a year. Therefore, he sent Deputy Minister Zheng Tianxi and others to various parts of China, including North and South China, to conduct investigations. After collecting their investigation reports and combining them with his own observations, he would compile a document and request the Legislative Yuan to reform the system.</p>
<h3>Hope for Recovery</h3>
<p>Luo expressed his great distress that the Shanghai Special District Court agreement had expired without achieving the goal of revision. At the same time, he acknowledged that there was a need to study the criticisms of delays in execution and other procedural matters. He hoped that active efforts would be made at this time so that the next time the agreement expired, it would not be extended and the goal of recovery could be achieved. Regarding the recovery of the right to manage prisons in the Public Settlement, Luo said that it would be difficult to achieve at this time.</p>
<h3>Abolishing Special Laws</h3>
<p>Finally, Luo answered reporters' questions, stating that regarding the issue of abolishing the "Emergency Measures for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China," some had proposed abolishing all special laws this spring. The laws concerning opium had already been abolished, but the remaining laws had not been passed by the Central Political Council. (New Voice Society)</p>
<h3>Municipal Authorities Focus on Revitalizing Northern Shanghai</h3>
<p>Only 30% Recovered After the War</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: After the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, the houses in the Zhabei area of this city were almost completely destroyed by artillery fire. According to a survey by the municipal authorities, the losses were enormous. In terms of real estate alone, the area of destroyed buildings in Zhabei was over 670,000 square meters for multi-story buildings and over 250,000 square meters for single-story buildings, with an estimated total loss of over 29,963,000 yuan (losses from the destruction of the Commercial Press and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station are not included in the above figures). In Jiangwan, the area of destroyed buildings was over 76,000 square meters for multi-story buildings and over 44,000 square meters for single-story buildings, with an estimated total loss of over 3,640,000 yuan. In Wusong, the area of destroyed buildings was over 44,000 square meters for multi-story buildings and over 91,000 square meters for single-story buildings. In other areas such as Yinxiang, the destroyed area was over 13,000 square meters, in Zhenru, over 3,000 square meters, and in Pengpu, over 6,000 square meters. The losses in these three areas also amounted to over 310,000 yuan. In total, the area of destroyed buildings was over 1,210,000 square meters, with an estimated value of nearly 40,000,000 yuan. Over the years, the municipal authorities have been working to revitalize the area and cooperating with the people. However, the people's finances have been exhausted after the war, and the municipal authorities are also constrained by the limited financial resources of the city treasury. Although they have exhausted their wisdom, it has not been easy to plan comprehensively. Currently, it has been found that the area rebuilt by the people by the end of last December was only over 168,000 square meters, with a value of over 4,190,000 yuan, accounting for only one-tenth of the total, and nine-tenths of the area is still rubble. It is reported that the municipal financial authorities are actively planning to find ways to support the citizens' economy and increase their recovery power so that the area can return to its former glory as soon as possible and improve the city's appearance. Even if it is not possible to provide full assistance, it is hoped that half the effort can be provided. If the public has any opinions to contribute, they are willing to accept them sincerely for reference.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Announces Losses of Shanghai Factories in the War</h3>
<p>Totaling 896 Factories</p>
<p>Totaling Over 53 Million Yuan</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident last year, the direct and indirect losses suffered by factories throughout Shanghai have been repeatedly investigated by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and now the information is clear. The total number of factories affected is 896, with total losses amounting to 53,079,195.86 yuan. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau officially announced the detailed losses yesterday, as follows:</p>
<h3>Significance of the Announcement</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a city with a dense concentration of factories and the industrial center of the country. After the January 28th Incident last year, the Japanese invaders occupied Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other districts and indiscriminately bombed them. The state of war lasted for four months, and the factories in the war zone were almost completely destroyed. Factories in other areas also suffered huge losses, totaling over 50,000,000 yuan. For the convenience of the world's reference, before publishing the statistics on factory losses in this city, we will briefly outline the preparation of these statistics as follows:</p>
<h3>Source of Materials</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, the Social Affairs Bureau, in conjunction with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Accountants Association, held a war loss registration, printed registration forms, and notified companies, businesses, factories, [blank] groups, and residents in the city to fill in the forms separately. These statistics are mostly based on these registration forms. However, the factory section of the registration form listed a total of 965 factories. After detailed sorting, it was found that some of them could not be considered factories according to the ordinary meaning of "factory". These materials had to be removed when compiling these statistics. After [blank] sorting, only 684 factories in this city filled out the registration form [blank] and reported losses. However, the war lasted for a long time, and all factories in the city suffered direct or indirect losses, while only one-third of the total number of factories in the city reported their losses to the registration office. In order to ensure accuracy, this bureau conducted a detailed follow-up investigation. However, due to limitations of time and resources, this follow-up investigation was limited to factories in the war zone. During the follow-up investigation, staff from this bureau went to the war zone to investigate existing factories. If they encountered factories that had not yet reported war losses, they would distribute registration forms and ask them to fill them in according to the format. Then, the existing factories were compared with the directory of factories obtained by this bureau in the previous year to accurately determine the total number of destroyed factories. Among all the destroyed factories, those that had not yet reported losses were investigated by finding the factory owner's address and inquiring about the exact amount of losses. However, in the case of 164 factories, their owners had moved around and could not be found after the factories were destroyed. The total losses of these 164 factories [blank] could only be estimated by referring to this bureau's old records and based on the factory's capital, product type, business conditions, etc.</p>
<h3>Degree of Accuracy</h3>
<p>The loss items listed on the war loss registration form are as follows: (Personnel Losses) Number of employees who died, were injured, went missing, were kidnapped, or became unemployed, and the resulting loss of monthly production capacity, as well as funeral expenses, medical expenses, and search expenses, etc.; (Property Losses) Houses, machinery, equipment, fittings, inventory, materials, etc.; (Indirect Losses) Bad debts, relocation costs, employees' private property, etc. There is also an average monthly operating loss item, which is calculated for three months for ease of calculation and included in the indirect losses item. Looking at the registration forms filled in by each factory, the personnel loss item was the most sketchy. Property losses were more fixed, and the reports filled in by each factory were more detailed. However, since most factories rented their factory buildings from others, the factory owners did not include the buildings when reporting losses. In the indirect losses, the bad debts item was estimated by each factory when the war had not yet stopped, so it was difficult to be accurate. Therefore, among the above three types of losses, the most accurate should be the property losses, followed by the indirect losses, and then the personnel losses. Many factories outside the war zone suffered indirect losses that were not reported, and it was impossible to verify them for a while. Also, larger factories with greater losses, such as the Commercial Press and the Yong'an Second Yarn Factory, all made detailed lists and reported them separately. Their reports only listed property losses.</p>
<h3>Two National Goods Organizations Telegraph Request to Cancel the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement</h3>
<p>The National Goods Maintenance Association and the Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods telegraphed the National Government, Yuan, and Ministries yesterday, requesting the cancellation of the Sino-Japanese tariff reciprocity agreement: "To Chairman Lin of the National Government of the Capital, Acting Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, Foreign Minister Luo, Finance Minister Song, and Industry Minister Chen: We respectfully report that since the implementation of the tariff reciprocity agreement, our country's industry and commerce have suffered greatly. To list the most important points: (1) The goods imported by Japan into our country under Part A are numerous and comprehensive, totaling over 700 items, all of which are absolutely dumped on our national goods. On the other hand, the goods exported by our country to Japan under Part A are only three categories: silk, embroidery, and summer cloth. The disparity in quantity is too great to be equal and reciprocal; (2) Japanese goods shipped to China are subject to low taxes in our country, where tariff autonomy has not been fully achieved, and can be dumped as much as possible, destroying national goods. On the other hand, our three categories of goods shipped to Japan are subject to squeeze from high Japanese taxes, almost completely disappearing. For example, our silk used to be a major commodity sold to Japan and Korea, but Japan suddenly added a tax of 100% of the value. Although it has been reduced by 30 after several negotiations, it is still 70% of the value. After the tax reduction, no goods can still be sent. The tax reduction in name is equal to no reduction in fact. The Japanese customs officials arbitrarily estimate the cost of goods to be more than double, causing our silk and embroidery to be blocked by heavy taxes for nearly a year. Summer cloth is also being gradually eliminated, causing all industries to be depressed and on the verge of death. Under this serious situation, even without the tragic September 18th Incident last year and the occupation of the Northeast, this reciprocity agreement should also be abolished. It is difficult for the amount of tariffs to be equal and reciprocal. Therefore, the decline of national goods in recent years is entirely due to the dumping of Japanese goods with low taxes. If our government does not abolish the agreement in time, national goods will inevitably be defeated and have no foothold. Therefore, in order to provide a lifeline for the slightly budding national goods, it is necessary to abolish the agreement in order to save the crisis. The national economy and people's livelihood are based on this. Furthermore, since the Northeast was invaded and occupied by the violent Japanese and customs duties were forcibly seized, the taxes on national goods have been extremely high, increasing by 600 to 700% compared with the previous tax rates, and even [blank] times. As a result, the transportation of national goods to [blank] has been greatly affected and is likely to be impossible, following in the footsteps of Korea. The future of national goods is extremely painful. After a joint meeting of our associations, we respectfully request that the government, Yuan, and Ministries quickly announce the abolition of the agreement and implement tariff autonomy in order to protect the national foundation and ensure the people's livelihood. We are eager to await your order. The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association and the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods."</p>
<h3>Huang Naishu Discusses Increasing Postage to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Still Charging Half Price for Letters Sent Abroad</p>
<p>Small Increase, Little Impact on Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Affected by the seizure of postal rights in the Northeast and the fall in silver prices in recent years, the Post Office has suffered significant deficits. Director Huang Naishu [blank] is aware of this difficulty and has spared no effort in seeking ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditures. Recently, he proposed to revise the postage rates between the Southeast Asian Islands and Fujian and Guangdong. Outsiders, unaware of the true situation, have made many erroneous reports. The Central News Agency reporter specially visited Director Huang to inquire about everything, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Previous Situation</h3>
<p>Director Huang said, "There are many Chinese living in the Southeast Asian Islands, and the exchange of letters and remittances is very busy. Therefore, there are private postal bureaus in Shantou, Xiamen, and other places to facilitate the overseas Chinese, and the postal fees collected are also very favorable. The method of posting is to pay according to the weight of the entire package. Since 1927, the postal bureaus in the American Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and French Annam, etc., except for Malaysia and the Southeast Asian Islands, have requested reforms in accordance with the Universal Postal Union Convention and have implemented them one after another, abolishing the method of posting entire packages."</p>
<h3>Preferential Treatment</h3>
<p>"In 1929, British Singapore also made the same request. Our postal bureau could not oppose it due to the Universal Postal Union Convention. However, at that time, the overseas Chinese directly negotiated with the Singapore Post Office, and a decision was made on preferential treatment. At that time, the postage for each overseas letter from our country weighing 20 grams was 10 cents, with a 50% discount, only charging 5 cents. Letters sent from Singapore were charged 6 cents in Singapore currency, which has been implemented to this day without any change."</p>
<h3>Three Price Increases</h3>
<p>"In the past three years, the price of silver has plummeted, and our country's post office has suffered huge losses due to foreign exchange. Therefore, the price has been increased three times, from 10 cents to 15 cents to 20 cents, and to today's 25 cents. This year, due to the seizure of the post office in the Northeast, income has decreased and deficits have increased. If this continues, our country's post office will go bankrupt. Therefore, there is a proposal to revise the fee for Singapore postal items. After Postal Director Lin submitted a request, he went to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to discuss it in order to proceed as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Still Charging Half Price</h3>
<p>"Currently, the fee for each overseas letter is 15 cents, while the fee for letters to that area is still 5 cents, only one-third. At a time when the price of gold is soaring and the post office is facing difficulties, it is difficult to cope without making corrections. Therefore, it is proposed to increase it to 12.5 cents, which, although increased, is still half price. Moreover, overseas Chinese remit money, send letters, etc., at most once a month, or once every few months. The increased burden is limited. The income of overseas Chinese has also increased proportionally with the soaring price of gold. This small burden should have no impact. But for the post office, every little bit helps, and the annual income can be slightly compensated. I hope all circles will recognize the facts."</p>
<h3>Silver and Banking Industries Express Support for Abolishing Taels and Replacing with Yuan</h3>
<p>Regarding the abolition of taels and replacement with yuan, the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement new currency weights and fineness on March 1st. The legally defined exchange rates for silver dollars and silver taels have also been stipulated. According to interviews conducted yesterday by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency with leaders in the silver and banking industries, if the nation wishes to unify its currency system, it must abolish taels and replace them with yuan. The new currency weights and fineness stipulated by the Ministry of Finance are based on the National Currency Ordinance of the Republic of China. Furthermore, during the initial implementation, the concurrent use of silver dollars and silver taels is permitted, and the stipulated legally defined exchange rates are not expected to cause any difficulties during implementation. Therefore, they are quite supportive. Moreover, after implementation, all transactions in various industries will be conducted using silver dollars, which will greatly simplify procedures.</p>
<h3>Roman Catholic Papal Delegate Archbishop Celso Costantini Returned to His Country Yesterday</h3>
<p>Catholic Leaders Gave a Warm Send-Off</p>
<p>Archbishop Celso Costantini, the Papal Delegate to China for the Holy See, had been residing in China for a long time and had become ill due to overwork. He returned to his country for medical treatment. Yesterday, the Italian Minister to China, Cianò, specially arranged for a first-class cabin on the Italian ship "Kanchi" and dispatched a special boat to transport him at the Customs Wharf. By 4:30 PM, the send-off party had gathered at the pier, including the Italian Minister's representative, the Italian Consul-General, Bishop Hu of the Nanjing Diocese, Bishop Zhu of the Haimen Diocese, Bishop Tan of the Kaifeng Diocese in Henan, President Sang of Shanghai, Director Zhang of Dongjiadu, Director Yao of Xujiahui, Director Lin of Aurora University, Director Wan of Yangjingbang, Director Bian of Hongkou, priests in charge of accounts from various religious associations, as well as Catholic gentry such as Ma Xiangbo, Lu Bohong, Zhu Zhiyao, Zhou Dean, Zhu Luyi, Zhu Weilin, Lu Yingeng, Mao Youren, Zhu Tingzuo, Shen Shumei, and male and female Catholic followers, numbering over a thousand. Each held a send-off flag and waited expectantly at the pier. At 5:00 PM, Costantini arrived at the pier from Nanjing Road in a car. Military music played loudly, and firecrackers were set off. Lu Bohong stepped forward, opened the car door, and personally assisted Costantini out of the car. Amidst applause, Costantini walked to the pier with a cane, his manner affable and approachable. He smiled and returned greetings to the send-off party, raised his hand in blessing, and engaged in a brief conversation, his tone revealing infinite affection, as if reluctant to leave China. After taking photographs, he boarded the ferry and sailed away amidst the waves. Seeing Costantini on the boat, he repeatedly nodded, expressing his deep reluctance.</p>
<h3>Catholics See Off Archbishop Costantini Returning to His Country</h3>
<h3>Both Sides Will Inspect Today After Two Ships Collide</h3>
<p>Families of the Deceased Resolve to Lodge Protests</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's "Ningbo" steamer and the Zhongwei Company's "Taiping" steamer collided in the waters off Dongjiadu the day before yesterday, causing damage to civilian boats and drowning crew members and passengers. Yesterday, the two companies negotiated with each other and decided to conduct an inspection today. The families of the deceased will lodge protests. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Negotiations Between the Two Parties</h3>
<p>After receiving the report from the owner of the "Taiping" steamer, the Zhongwei Company immediately sent a letter to the Taikoo Company yesterday morning, stating roughly that their "Taiping" steamer was damaged by the Taikoo Company's "Ningbo" steamer at 11:40 AM on February 9th, causing damage to civilian boats and drowning fatalities. They requested that personnel be sent for inspection tomorrow morning. The "Taiping" steamer is moored at the Zhoupu Zhonghua Wharf. As for the damaged civilian boats and drowned fatalities, the Taikoo Company should be responsible for compensation, etc. After receiving the report from the owner of the "Ningbo" steamer, the Taikoo Company also sent a letter to the Zhongwei Company yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The letter roughly stated that at 11:40 AM on February 9, 1933, the Taikoo Company's "Ningbo" steamer collided with the Zhongwei Company's "Taiping" steamer at the Dongjiadu shipyard. The "Ningbo" steamer has now entered the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. Please send personnel to inspect it at 4:00 PM today, etc.</p>
<h3>Inspection Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the Zhongwei Company received the letter from the Taikoo Company, they did not have time to send personnel for inspection. They immediately reported the situation to the Jianghai Customs Shipping Office, the Navigation Administration Bureau, and the Shipping Association, and decided that this morning, the two companies would jointly inspect the damage to the two ships with notaries and surveyors, and study the issue of responsibility for the collision. According to Zhongwei officials whom the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter met yesterday, the Ningbo steamer was believed to have been travelling the wrong route, and despite the Taiping steamer's horn signal, there was no response, leading to the disaster, and the Taikoo Company should bear full responsibility. Officials from the Taikoo Company stated that the Taiping steamer had already stopped and anchored, and the Taiping steamer should not have continued to advance, pushing the blame onto one another. Who is right and who is wrong remains to be determined after inspection.</p>
<h3>Water Patrol Report</h3>
<p>The Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau released a report yesterday regarding the collision between the "Taiping" and "Ningbo" steamers, stating that around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, they received a report of a ship collision at the Sanda Wharf in Puxi. Team Leader, Zhang Kefeng, and water police Wang Xuede, Lu Gengsheng, and Li Xiu were dispatched to investigate and provide rescue. The "Ningbo" steamer was outbound, and the "Taiping" steamer was inbound. As a result of the collision, the "Taiping" steamer veered towards the west bank, causing damage or destruction to the sand barges, sampans, and gravel boats moored alongside. In addition, a cargo ship that had just departed from the Guild Wharf was broken into two sections by the collision. All passengers and crew members fell into the water. One person, Shen Guanxi, was rescued with a waist injury and taken to Shanghai Hospital by the team.</p>
<h3>Details of the Losses</h3>
<p>The cargo ship, registration number 6688, which departed from the Guild Wharf and was heading towards the Wu Chong Jing area opposite Longhua Nandang Estuary, was captained by Wang Yugen. It had a carrying capacity of about 400 dan. Each passenger was charged only 15 copper coins for a round trip on the same day. On that day, it was carrying 29 passengers and 3 crew members. It was struck shortly after leaving the shore, and the ship was completely submerged in two sections. All passengers and crew members fell into the water. One person, Shen Guanxi, was rescued by the water patrol team and was injured. Another person, Zhang A Wang, was rescued by the Rescue Bureau but died immediately. The rest drifted with the waves. Fourteen sand barges and five sampans belonging to Yang Wanlin and other boatmen were damaged. One cargo ship sank. The "Taiping" and "Ningbo" steamers each sustained minor damage. The total amount of losses is estimated at around 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Issues Arise with Freight Costs After Rice Industry Adopts New Measuring Instruments</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants and Laborers Hold to Their Respective Positions</p>
<p>The Shanghai rice industry has always used the Haihu (sea peck) as the standard for trading rice, with ten dou (pecks) making one shi (stone). However, the Haihu is no longer suitable for use. New measuring instruments have been adopted, with each shi being smaller than the old Haihu by one and a half dou, making it eight and a half dou. This has been implemented since the first of this month. All transactions in the market are conducted using the new measuring instruments. However, this has led to disputes in barge transportation, cartage, and porterage. Those who pay for the services believe that since the old system was based on the Haihu, and the new measuring instrument is smaller, the costs should be reduced proportionally. However, the barge operators and carters argue that they are paid per bag and cannot reduce costs simply because the quantity of goods is slightly less. Rice merchants now believe that the amount of rice sold daily in both the north and south markets exceeds 10,000 shi, all of which is purchased by rice merchants. Compared to the old instruments, this amounts to 1,500 shi less per 10,000 shi. Cartage and other fees are not a small amount. Monthly statistics are even more considerable. If the costs are not calculated and reduced based on the new measuring instruments, it would be unfair and a significant loss. Who can bear this? The carters do not understand the underlying reasons, leading to disputes. It is requested that rice merchants' leaders inform the cartage foremen and mediate the situation.</p>

The original letter from Sun Bangrui and others to Mayor Wu is as follows: Respected Mayor, we have read in the newspapers that Your Honor has initiated aviation to save the nation, which is deeply admired. Although our financial resources are limited, we have collected 100 洋 (Yuan, silver dollar) from our monthly salaries to donate for the purchase of the "Shanghai Merchant" aircraft. We know that this small amount may not be of practical help, but we hope it will serve as an example for all of Shanghai to rise up and purchase an aircraft, which will provide some support to national defense.</p>

<h3>Aviation Gift Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Minbao Newspaper launched Aviation to Save the Nation Gift Certificates. This proposal has been co-initiated by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Lin Wojiang, Director of the Aviation Association. The detailed measures are recorded below: The call for "Aviation to Save the Nation" has been very loud. All Chinese citizens should do their part to pool their efforts and achieve the goal. However, the people have long suffered from economic hardship, and the difficulties after the war are even more pronounced. To enable everyone to contribute without being harsh or disruptive, and without harming oneself or others, a large amount of money can be raised in a single transaction. The launch of the "Aviation to Save the Nation Gift Certificates" by our colleagues is the easiest and most meaningful method to implement. Based on our humble understanding, we propose the following measures, hoping that patriotic compatriots will promote them together. This will fulfill the human obligation of "reciprocity" and the practical effect of "saving the nation and wiping out shame." We intend to first solicit 500 initiators in order to formally propose to the China Aviation Association for implementation. Anyone who agrees with this proposal is requested to immediately provide their name, address, and occupation to this newspaper so that everyone can easily collect, benefit, and achieve the best results. (1) In the future, for all personal interactions, whether for weddings, funerals, birthdays, etc., sending "Aviation to Save the Nation Gift Certificates" will be the highest respect for the other party. (2) Those who receive national salvation gift certificates will not issue power money or hold banquets, embodying the spirit of thrift while being patriotic. (3) When sending gift certificates, the sender and recipient, as well as the date, must be indicated on the certificate. It can only be used once and cannot be transferred. (4) Gift certificates are divided into wedding and funeral styles, with eight denominations: half a yuan, one yuan, two yuan, four yuan, six yuan, eight yuan, ten yuan, and fifty yuan. The style of the gift certificate should be exquisite, and those with higher values ​​can be preserved as permanent souvenirs. (5) The gift certificates are issued by the China Aviation Association and sold by various banks on commission. Each bank will establish an "Aviation to Save the Nation Gift Certificate Account." All funds from sales will be deposited into this account and reconciled monthly, with public reports. (6) Reputable and respected individuals and representatives of statutory organizations will be appointed to form a custody committee and be responsible for auditing. (7) All funds from this program will be used to purchase aircraft. Shanghai Minbao Newspaper, 201 Shandong Road.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Negotiates Water Shutoff</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association wrote to the Public Works Department to negotiate the water shutoff issue with the Shanghai Waterworks Company. The letter stated: We are writing to you regarding the letter from the Huada Real Estate Company stating that since the Waterworks Company changed to using water meters, water bills have increased sharply, placing a heavy burden on the people. Our firm leases 100 houses in Yuanfu Lane, Tangshan Road. According to the previous system of bundled water charges, we paid 152 yuan and 20 jiao per month. Since the water meters were installed in July of last year, the price has been more than four times higher. Furthermore, the water bills for Shuncheng Lane, Kunming Road, and Shunzhi Lane in Zhoujiapai, Yangshupu, are also calculated according to water meters, making it impossible to pay. The Waterworks Company suddenly shut off the main water pipes in Yuanfu Lane, Shuncheng Lane, and Shunzhi Lane yesterday, implementing a water shutoff. We are writing to you to request that your association quickly negotiate with the Waterworks Company to immediately reopen the closed main water pipes to benefit the lives of the people. We believe that shutting off the water is not a fundamental solution to the water price issue. In the event of a major change that affects the lives of users, our association and your bureau will not be able to stand idly by. Based on the above situation, we hereby request that your bureau instruct the Waterworks Company to restore the water supply in order to protect the lives of the people and await a resolution. To the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>

Now that it is necessary to send representatives to attend the reconsideration to explain the situation, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating: Urgent, Respected President Song of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, Regarding the case of seizing civilian land in the Pengpu area for the joint transportation hub, reports state that the Executive Yuan has approved our request and ordered the four ministries and the Shanghai Municipal Government to reconsider the matter on the 7th, showing your compassion for the people's difficulties and respect for public opinion.

<p>The "Great American Evening Post" reported that two American youths in Shanghai plan to set sail in a Chinese sailing vessel early next week, braving the ocean to fulfill their ambition of riding the long winds and breaking through thousands of miles of waves. The two youths are Belon Shied from Hutersdock, New York, and Vance Swords from New York City.

They are accompanied by adventurers Clark and Rufiu, two White Russians, and a Chinese captain. The ship is named "New Horizon," is only 65 feet long, and the main mast is 55 feet high. It relies entirely on wind power. The ship is also equipped with a small boat with a motor for towing the sailing vessel when entering ports. Their route is planned to first go to Hong Kong, then to Guam, and then to Honolulu. After passing Guam, they will tour the nearby islands to entertain themselves. After that, they plan to go directly to San Francisco, then take the Panama Canal to reach New York.</p>
<h3>Zhang Baofu and His Wife Turn Against Each Other, Cutting off Water and Electricity Supply</h3>
<p>Past Affection All Flows Away</p>
<p>Wife, as Agent for Their Son, Sues in Court</p>
<p>丨Judge Kindly Advocates Reconciliation丨</p>
<p>Zhang Baofu, the head of the accounting department of the Jianghai Customs, a native of Beiping, graduated from the Beiping Taxation School. In the 18th year of the Republic [1929], he married Ms. Xu, a fellow Beiping native and student at Xiehe School. Because both were Christians, the wedding was presided over by Pastor Huang. After the marriage, they came to Shanghai to work and lived together at No. 40 Yide Lane, Raul Road, in the French Concession. Their relationship was still harmonious, and they had a son named Pingping, who is now two years old. Recently, their love suddenly broke down, almost becoming enemies. At that time, Zhang ordered Ms. Xu to return to Beiping, but she refused. Zhang cut off the electricity and running water and did not give her any living expenses. Ms. Xu had no choice but to rent a pavilion at No. 50 in the same lane and live there. She also turned to the Women's Association for help. The association and several Christian colleagues from the Customs mediated several times, but all failed. Ms. Xu then sought a connection with a Western family to teach Chinese in order to maintain the livelihood of herself and her son. On one hand, she hired attorney Qiu Fenling to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court, with her son Pingping as the plaintiff and Zhang Xu as the legal representative, accusing Zhang Baofu of neglecting his duty to raise their child. She requested alimony for Pingping of 180 yuan per year until the age of 20, totaling 3,240 yuan in silver, plus 2,000 yuan for education expenses, and alimony for Ms. Xu of 500 yuan per year until the age of 60, totaling 32 years, for a total of 16,000 yuan in silver. In total, the sum was 21,240 yuan in silver. Because she could not afford the litigation fees, she requested litigation assistance. The Special Court approved her request. Yesterday morning, Luo Mou Tai, recommended by Wen Min's Fourth Tribunal, summoned Zhang Xu, the plaintiff, who brought Zhang Pingping to court on time. Zhang Baofu, the defendant, was unable to attend due to war affairs. His mother, Ms. Dong, represented him in court. First, the plaintiff, Zhang Xu, testified, "The defendant is now even more hostile to me than an enemy. Since August of last year, he has cut off my living expenses. I do not want to divorce the defendant. I only ask for living expenses to maintain my life. As for all the defendant's behavior, I do not want to announce it. It is not that I do not want to live with him, but it is because I cannot bear to live with him again." She said that the defendant's monthly income was more than 400 yuan, and he had promised to give her 150 yuan per month after she returned to Beiping, but her parents were not in Beiping, and she had no relatives, so she did not want to go there, and she only asked for 500 yuan per year, which was not too much. Then, Ms. Dong testified, denying that her son could earn more than 400 yuan a month, saying that his monthly salary was only 150 taels, which could be investigated, and hoping that her daughter-in-law could continue to live with him. The court held that in personnel lawsuits, the parties must be present in court, and that disputes between husband and wife were originally emotional. If a judgment was made by the official authorities, it would be difficult to restore affection. Therefore, reconciliation was the best option. The hearing was postponed and they were instructed to go outside and try to reconcile. If they could not reconcile, the defendant must be present in court at the next hearing. The judge would try to persuade both parties to make peace and avoid further litigation. After the instructions were given, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Another Person Killed at the Flower Fair</h3>
<p>Ma Zhitian Hangs Himself on Iron Bars</p>
<p>Ma Zhitian, a Muslim from Nanjing, 41 years old, who lived on the mezzanine floor of No. 34 Shenxiangge Road in the city, used to deal in chicken and duck business. He had a wife, Ms. Ma, and two children, a family of four, and their lives were very difficult. Ma did not seek to work hard in a proper way, but wanted to make a fortune through gambling. Therefore, he both played cards and indulged in flower fairs, which often led to a lack of food. Fortunately, his brother often helped him. The day before yesterday, because there was no rice to cook, his brother gave him five yuan. Unexpectedly, Ma used this as a desperate gamble, but he lost everything. Having no face to see his brother, he hanged himself on the iron bars of the window of the Wang Yi Ma Lane house behind his house. He was found dead by his neighbors, who notified his wife. The wife arrived and wanted to collect the body, but the Second District Police learned of it and ordered the local headman Jiang Pingyang to report to the local court for an inspection. Prosecutor Wu and others were commissioned to go to the scene, confirmed that he had died by hanging himself, and ordered the family to collect the body for burial.</p>

Then, dozens of ladies, including Wang Xiaoying, Song Zhen, and Wei Qiongying, entertained the guests separately. Dancing began amidst the melodious music. Many dancers among the guests competed for the dance girls, and some even spent large sums of money to buy tickets for them. It was said that the prizes for the dance girls were worth hundreds of gold, including fashionable clothes, evening dresses, French powder boxes, clothing materials, large silver earrings, silver pagodas, platinum chain clasps, earrings, etc. The dance stars who won the most dance tickets were Liang Saishan, Liang Saizhu, Little Sister of the Moon Palace, and Lafei Wang Xiuying. There were also dance stars who did not register in time because it was too late. They will be announced after registration. The dance stars who won prizes sent the prizes to the dance halls to show their gratitude. About several thousand yuan of prize tickets were sold on the spot. Because the venue was small, the guests were crowded, and time was short, the drawing of prizes was not completed. It was heard that it was decided to postpone the drawing of prizes and an announcement would be published in the newspaper at that time.</p>

<h3>On Mutual Assistance between Entrepreneurs and the Financial Community</h3>
<p>Wang Yansong Publishes His Views</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yansong, Executive Committee Member of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and General Manager of the Silk Industry Bank, recently deeply felt the shortcomings of entrepreneurs and their impact on the financial community, and published this article for discussion by the business and financial communities.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], China's industry and commerce encountered unprecedented difficulties. During this year, there was always a hidden crisis in the market. Now that the final settlement period has passed, all industries are generally stable. The financial industry has also achieved good results due to early preparations. This phenomenon was really beyond our expectations. However, the country is currently in distress, and the market is declining. Financial institutions should be cautious and careful for their own safety, and strive for prudence in lending. However, for the sake of developing industry and commerce, financial institutions should also take responsibility. There is more than one way to save the country and resist the enemy, and promoting domestic products is the only predetermined policy for our entire nation. Whether the promotion is effective and what the results of the progress are depend on the self-awareness of the people on the one hand, and on whether the domestic products can meet the needs of the people on the other hand. Although domestic product manufacturers have recently shown a tendency to progress, the fact that capital cannot be supplied sufficiently is undeniable. Because the capital is insufficient, the productivity will be limited, and there is no way to develop and improve. Therefore, domestic product production is nominally the responsibility of domestic product manufacturers, but in reality, financial institutions should also take responsibility. In this society of free enterprise and free competition, the rise and fall of national wealth depends on the prosperity and decline of business, and people in the world pay too much attention to the amount of capital and the level of interest rates, and ignore the character and ability of entrepreneurs. The richest country in the world is the United States, and the most developed industry and commerce is also the United States. In short, the ability of the United States to have what it has today is by no means accidental. Several years ago, a professor at an American university wrote a book called "The American Soul," in which he described the fundamental reasons for the development of industry and commerce in the United States, saying that Americans have a strong will and great energy in business management. One of the most insightful sections, which is sufficient for our reference, is "Mexico and South America are also emerging countries, with abundant products, fertile land, and mild climate. The breadth of their resources is comparable to that of the United States, and they have no less opportunities for economic activity than the United States. However, the reason why these countries have ultimately failed to achieve the same development as industry and commerce in the United States is not limited to one aspect, but the most important of these is the spirit of the people, because the perseverance, agility, and integrity of the South American countries are by no means comparable to those of the United States." We tasted these words, which are enough to awaken our deep reflection. Compared to Americans, how are the so-called entrepreneurs of our country today in terms of their spirit of doing things, willpower, personality, and ability? Most industrialists and merchants are concerned with immediate gains and are ignorant of long-term plans. They are extravagant in their personal enjoyment and only focus on the present in their business plans. It is nothing more than empty talk to talk about saving the country through industry in this way. Our country's various industries are in urgent need of development. The development of industry needs capital, but it also needs entrepreneurs with personality and ability. Credit is most important in the business world. If an industry is managed by an entrepreneur with personality and ability, then its credit will definitely be obvious. Once the credit is established, all parties will be happy to invest. As the Western proverb says, credit is capital, which is what it means. In recent years, there has been a lot of floating capital in our country's market, and the financial industry has a feeling of indigestion. Among financial institutions, they should choose entrepreneurs with personality and ability among caution, and give them full economic accommodation, so that domestic industries will develop day by day, and entrepreneurs should also fully cultivate and maintain their reputation, so as to obtain the convenience of financial accommodation. In this way, the financial community and entrepreneurs can be linked together, and the future of industry will be beneficial.</p>
<h3>Japan's Foreign Trade in January</h3>
<p>The Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office in Shanghai received an official telegram from Tokyo yesterday, reporting that Japan's foreign trade in January this year amounted to JPY 107,000,000 in exports and JPY 173,000,000 in imports, resulting in a trade deficit of JPY 66,000,000, an increase of nearly 50% compared to the same period last year. In addition, Japan's total trade volume with various countries last year was as follows:</p>
<p>Country Export Value (in JPY) Trade Surplus or Deficit</p>
<p>United States 445,000,000 Deficit 64,000,000</p>
<p>British India 192,000,000 Surplus 75,000,000</p>
<p>Nanyang 159,000,000 Surplus 63,000,000</p>
<p>Australia 36,000,000 Deficit 97,000,000</p>
<p>United Kingdom 59,000,000 Deficit 19,000,000</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's trade with China last year, the office received a telegram from Tokyo on January 18, stating that exports to mainland China amounted to JPY 147,000,000, with a surplus of JPY 69,000,000, and exports to the three northeastern provinces amounted to JPY 146,000,000, with a surplus of JPY 18,000,000. Furthermore, Japan's total export volume in foreign trade last year amounted to JPY 1,457,000,000, of which exports to the United States accounted for nearly one-third of the total. The total import volume was JPY 1,523,000,000, of which imports from the United States also accounted for slightly less than one-third, which is also worth noting.</p>

<h3>Yu Yan Discusses Railway Business Reorganization (Continued)</h3>
<p>丨Two Points Contributing to Future Policy丨</p>
<p>(7) Streamlining Rolling Stock Materials (A) The purchase and use of rolling stock materials are of great importance and constitute a significant portion of railway expenditure. Recently, our company submitted a report that was approved regarding the coal quantity for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. After chemical testing, it was determined that the No. 1 coal from Zhongxing and Kai Tou mines best met the needs of these railways. Previously, delivery in Shanghai cost $18.50 per ton, but now delivery in Pukou costs only $10 per ton. The railway's monthly coal consumption is approximately 15,000 tons, so this alone can save over one million yuan. (B) Consumption standards for rolling stock materials should be investigated and determined. There are significant differences in the amount of rolling stock materials consumed by different railways, with some varying by more than double. There must be instances of abuse and waste. Our company has already assigned experts to conduct practical research on material consumption standards, and a draft plan has been prepared. A comprehensive reform policy will be implemented soon. (8) Increasing Vehicle Utilization Efficiency The supervision of vehicle utilization efficiency has not been given close attention for decades, resulting in some railways having vehicles but not using them effectively, while others suffer from vehicle shortages. This has even led to various malpractices such as the private sale of freight cars. According to reliable statistics compiled by our company, out of every 100 freight cars, the actual number used on each railway is as follows: Qinghe 20.5, Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou 19.6, Beining 15.9, PingSui 6.2, LongHai 5.8, Jinpu 5.5, Pinghan 5.3, Xiang-E 4.7. Currently, across the country's railways, there are 12,000 freight cars, but the average utilization rate is less than 10 percent, which is deeply regrettable. The current remedial measures that have been communicated to all railways for implementation include: defining extended ton-kilometers, implementing nighttime loading and unloading, reducing loading and unloading time, reducing switching time, creating train timetables, etc., in order to increase efficiency. (9) Responsible Joint Transportation Conference This is of great importance. As mentioned earlier, a responsible joint transportation joint conference was held, involving the joint transportation office, the business department, and three other parties, to discuss and determine the national responsible joint transportation criteria. Another meeting is expected to complete the process. (10) Organizing Exhibitions of Products Along the Railway Lines For the sake of commercial and transport development, our office will hold traveling exhibitions in major cities, showcasing the products, output, transport volume, production site prices, sales site prices, freight rates, taxes, transport and sales locations, production seasons, and all related charts and statistics of each railway line. This will allow merchants in various cities to directly recognize the styles of goods, the quantities sold in various locations, and profit projections, directly promoting commercial transport and indirectly revitalizing domestic production, with significant benefits. The first exhibition is planned to be held in Shanghai, with over 5,000 items already collected and currently being counted, registered, and arranged for display. The opening is expected in mid-March. (11) Publishing Various Publications (A) Publishing a national travel guide to stimulate travel interest and serve as a guide for travelers. A thick volume is about to be completed. (B) Compiling a national product directory along the railway lines to enable merchants to better understand products from various regions. It has recently been sent to print. (C) Compiling a freight guide with detailed explanations of all freight-related information and procedures, allowing merchants to understand the actual situation and not rely solely on transport companies. It is currently being compiled. (D) Compiling a small booklet of railway information, to be distributed or sold cheaply to passengers and merchants, so that people can learn about travel and trade routes, and generally understand the real situation of the railways. It is also currently being written. (E) The Beijing-Guangdong Railway Survey Report is currently being compiled. (F) A comparative table of operating revenue and expenditure of each railway over the past ten years has been compiled and printed in a few copies for research purposes. (G) A report on military transport equipment for national defense has been compiled, including important equipment and transport capacity of each railway. However, due to the confidentiality, it is not appropriate to publish it. Mr. Yu also expressed two hopes: (1) Railway freight rates should be autonomous; (2) The railway's equalization and transportation policy should be realized, so that political power extends to the people, making things convenient for them.</p>
<h3>Increase in Copper Coin Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Since the abolition of the silver dollar standard in this city, before the reopening of various businesses, small money changers and tobacco and paper shops were exchanging silver dollars for cash at a rate of 2,670 to 2,680 cash coins per silver dollar, 310 cash coins for five small silver coins (dimes), and 450 to 460 cash coins for a double dime (20 cent coin). Since the reopening of businesses, the exchange rate has steadily increased. Yesterday (the 10th), the exchange rate was 3,000 cash coins per dollar, and 490 cash coins for five dimes (20 cent coins), or twelve dimes (six double dimes). The exchange rate for dimes and double dimes was 490 cash coins. However, the posted exchange rate for silver dollars at the Jiangyuan exchange was already 3,020 cash coins, and 500 cash coins for dimes (double dimes). Within these two weeks, the difference in the exchange rate has been as much as 300 cash coins per silver dollar.</p>
<h3>Opening of the General Management Office for Various Industries Insurance</h3>
<p>The General Management Office of Various Industries Insurance Co., Ltd., located on the second floor of the Silk Industry Bank on Hankou Road in this city, opened yesterday. Guests who attended included Preparatory Commander Dai Ji, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya, Director of the Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Committee Wu Kaixian, and over 500 people including Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Pei Yunqing, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Song Hanzhang, Xu Ji, Chen Zhezhen, Pan Yangyao, Li Shuxiong, Chen Yizhou, Pan Xusheng, Yan Chengde, Xu Kesheng, Li Yanling, Hu Yonglai, Hu Yong_, Zhao _, Ding Xuetang, Liang Guohua, and Fang Shangui. The company's Chairman Wang Yansong, Managing Director Chen Songyuan, Zhu Wenqi, Directors Sun Meitang, Ge Jechen, Zheng Zenan, Dong Hancha, General Manager Fang Jiaobo, Deputy General Managers Ye Jiaxing, Bao Jingdi, and all directors, supervisors, and staff warmly welcomed the guests. The guests expressed their full sympathy for the company's aim to promote Chinese merchant insurance and protect the interests of policyholders. It is reported that over 50 companies took out insurance on the same day, and the future development of the business can be assured. The company's opening declaration is transcribed below: The insurance business is of utmost importance, as it concerns the prosperity of society and the safety of individual lives. For decades, foreign merchants have controlled it, resulting in a monopoly. Compensation is often complicated. The Chinese people do not understand this, and when paying premiums and taking out insurance, they often do not carefully consider the options. They may be persuaded by introductions or attracted by low premiums, and then rashly accept the terms. When a claim arises, the company cites regulations, and the policyholder is unfamiliar with Western languages. Disputes arise and arguments ensue. As a result, payments are delayed, and discounts are arbitrarily applied. The businesses that suffer losses are unable to recover, and the lives that are affected lose their security. Is this not a regrettable situation? The colleagues of this company, in view of this situation, dare to use their desire to serve society to seek the welfare of the entire society and individual citizens, and to provide their knowledge for insurance-related consultations, to help policyholders choose companies, and to handle all post-accident procedures. They will strive, within the realm of possibility and within a reasonable period, to transfer the insurance business from foreign merchants to Chinese merchants, and to make the insurance process easier for policyholders. This is our humble goal. At the beginning of the opening, we hereby declare this.</p>
<h3>Seek Medical Attention Immediately After Being Bitten by a Dog</h3>
<p>A child surnamed Han from Hankou was bitten by a dog. Yesterday, he took a plane to Shanghai to seek medical attention at the Isolation Hospital of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession. This matter has attracted the attention of many people. According to the opinion of the Health Department of the Municipal Council, it is still unclear whether the child is suffering from rabies. If it is indeed rabies, then seeking medical attention may have been too late, as it has been eighty days since he was bitten. The current Pasteur treatment is a preventive measure. If medical attention is sought immediately after being bitten and injections are administered, one can be safe after fourteen days. The incubation period for rabies is about forty days to half a year. If the injection is administered too late and the toxin invades the central nervous system, there is no cure. Therefore, anyone who has been bitten by a dog must seek medical attention from the Health Department on the same day.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Natives in Shanghai Initiate the Formation of a Provincial Association</h3>
<p>Already Approved by the Party Headquarters for Record</p>
<p>The number of Jiangsu natives in Shanghai reaches over one million. Usually there is no unified group organization, so the spirit is dispersed, and all hometown businesses cannot be fully developed. It is more difficult to contribute to national construction work. Although each county has its own native-place organizations, they lack contact and are greatly hindered. Now, there are over a hundred Jiangsu natives in Shanghai, including He Yuanming, Tong Hangbai, Dai Yongchan, Hu Xingyao, Yu Yaoqiu, and Wu Xiu, who have realized this and have jointly initiated the organization of the Jiangsu Native-Place Association in Shanghai. They have already applied to the Municipal Party Headquarters for permission and have obtained Permit No. 101. The association is currently in the process of recruiting members and will be established soon.</p>
<h3>Chinese Traveling to Taiwan Must First Get Vaccinated</h3>
<p>The Osaka Shosen Kaisha (Osaka Merchant Shipping Co.) received a telegram from the Governor-General of Taiwan stating that smallpox outbreaks have recently occurred in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Shantou, and Hong Kong, and that they are infectious. Taiwan has implemented inspections. Overseas Chinese traveling from Shanghai, Fujian, Shantou, and Hong Kong have begun to be vaccinated this month. Chinese people going to Taiwan via Shanghai to Keelung and Kaohsiung must first get vaccinated at the Fumin Hospital in Shanghai and obtain a vaccination certificate. After fourteen days, they can purchase a boat ticket to Taiwan with this certificate. After boarding the boat, each person's certificate must be submitted to the ship's doctor. If they are deemed to be free of smallpox and epidemic diseases, they will be allowed to disembark; otherwise, they will be prohibited from landing and escorted back to Shanghai on the original boat. It will now be more difficult for Chinese to travel to Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Harmonica Society's Dinner Party Tonight</h3>
<p>Among the musical groups in this city, the Harmonica Society, established only two years ago, already has over two thousand members, a remarkable achievement. Recently, to celebrate its second anniversary and to connect emotionally and exchange knowledge, the society is scheduled to publish a "Second Anniversary Special Issue" at the end of this month. In addition to publishing new songs by President Wang and various photographs, charts, etc. of the society, those wishing to request a copy can send two dimes, and the book will be sent immediately. At the same time, the society is also scheduled to hold a "Dinner Party" for all male and female members tonight. In addition to inviting guests and sponsors Cai Yuanpei, Sun _, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xia_, Chen _, Rui _, Yuqi, Yang Shenzhi, Zhang Jiahui, Wang Zhonglin, and other gentlemen to speak, there will also be a large ensemble performance by the society's entire male and female harmonica team, as well as magic and musical performances. At the same time, President Wang will also print newly composed popular Guangdong ancient melodies "Little Peach Red", popular dance music "Diana" and "Arise and Save the Country" and other sheet music to give to all guests who attend. Whether or not you are a member, you are welcome to participate and reserve seats at the Society at 168 Sichuan Road. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>After the Beggar Left, Armed Robbery Occurred, and the Victims Were Shot</h3>
<p>Liu Fuxin, a 51-year-old man from Taizhou, lives in a bungalow at No. 163 Changming Road, Maigen Road, West Shanghai, with his wife, Mrs. Zhang, 43 years old, and his concubine, Mrs. Feng, 22 years old, both also from Taizhou. Liu usually makes a living by renting out rickshaws and has some savings. At around 6:50 p.m. yesterday, while Liu was having dinner with his wife and concubine, a ragged beggar came to his house to ask for help. Liu, seeing that he was pitiful, gave him two dimes. The beggar thanked him and left. Unexpectedly, as soon as the beggar reached the bamboo fence gate, four short-clad bandits suddenly jumped into the house. Two of them stood guard outside the gate empty-handed, while the other two, armed with pistols, rushed into the living room. They saw Liu's concubine, Mrs. Feng, washing the dishes, and she had a gold ring on her hand. The bandits snatched it off her finger and tried to break into the bedroom. Liu Fuxin saw this and rushed out to call for help. The two bandits heard him and quickly retreated. Seeing that Liu was still shouting, they desperately fired three or four shots and fled. Liu was shot in the right leg, and Liu's wife, Mrs. Zhang, was shot in the groin. Both fell to the ground in extreme pain. At the same time, neighbors heard the gunshots and came to investigate. Seeing the situation, they reported to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to the scene and took Liu to Bazilu Sanatorium Hospital and Liu's wife, Mrs. Zhang, to Guangren Hospital for separate treatment. Detectives were also dispatched to search for the bandits.</p>
<h3>Case of Trafficking Women Abroad</h3>
<p>Ning Chunda Has Sinister Intentions</p>
<p>Ms. Liu Gong Escapes Suspicion</p>
<p>Ning Chunda, a native of Hunan, 41 years old, is currently employed as a manager at Lishengxiang Boiler Factory at No. 483 Lima Road in Nanshi. Last year, Ning returned to his hometown on business and met Liu Gong, the wife of a former colleague. Ms. Liu, 26 years old, is a widow whose husband passed away and left behind a ten-year-old son. Due to the family's poverty, life has been particularly difficult since her husband's death. When Ning saw her, he was moved by her youth and beauty and tried to seduce her. He persuaded her to go to Shanghai to work in a factory. She believed him and came to Shanghai, staying at Ning's factory. After more than two months, Ning never mentioned introducing her to work at the factory. Although she repeatedly questioned him, Ning always gave vague answers. She became suspicious. The other day, Ning ordered her to go to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to obtain a passport. She thought, "Since I am not going abroad, why do I need a passport?" Fearing that Ning had ulterior motives, she refused to comply. As a result, the two sides disagreed and had a major conflict. The patrolman Wang Chunfu heard about it and brought both of them to the first district. During the preliminary interrogation, Liu Gong stated the above facts and requested an investigation. When questioned, Ning Chunda suddenly changed his story, claiming that Ms. Liu was his sister-in-law and that his brother, Chunguang, was doing business in Taiwan. She behaved improperly in the village, and last year when he returned home, she voluntarily came to Shanghai with him. The other day, he received a letter from his brother, instructing him to send her to Taiwan, so today he ordered her to go to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to obtain a passport so that she could leave for Taiwan immediately. All the things that she claimed were not true. When Liu Gong was questioned again, she said that her husband had died and that Ning intended to lure her to Taiwan and falsely claim that she was his sister-in-law. Because the statements of both parties differed, they were ordered to prepare documents and be sent to the bureau for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wang Yonggao Appeals, Denying the Rape of His Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>The Judge Advocates for Investigating the Victim's Age</p>
<p>Wang Yonggao, a native of Sichuan, only 26 years old, is a cargo agent residing at Yuji Xing Zhanfang on Guangdong Road. He became acquainted with Deng Yudada, a fellow native residing in the same place. Deng had an adopted daughter, Gui Xiang, who worked as a laundress. Therefore, Wang's clothes were also given to Gui Xiang to wash, so she was able to enter and exit Wang's room frequently. In September of last year, Deng _ came to Shanghai from Sichuan and suddenly heard the tea servants of the lodge calling Gui Xiang "Mrs. Wang." He became suspicious and questioned her. Gui Xiang confessed that she had been lured and raped by Wang Yonggao on the night of September 26. Deng immediately contacted Wang, saying that he should not have raped a girl under the age of sixteen, and reported it to the General Inspectorate. Detectives were dispatched to send Gui Xiang to the hospital, where it was found that her hymen had been ruptured for a long time. Wang Yonggao was arrested and sent to the First Special District Local Court for trial. He was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, as reported previously. Wang Yonggao was unwilling to accept the verdict and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. He stated various reasons, denying that he had committed rape, and also expressed doubt about Gui Xiang's age. He said that the claim that she was under sixteen was only stated by Deng Yuda and Gui Xiang, and there was no other definite evidence. He asked to be exonerated and the original judgment overturned. On the other hand, Deng Yuda also hired a lawyer to file a private suit against Wang Yonggao, requesting that he be ordered to pay compensation for damages. Yesterday afternoon, Court President Yu and Assessors Zhao and Zhou of the Second Branch of the High Court summoned all the witnesses to court for a hearing. In addition to stating the reasons for his objection, Wang Yonggao claimed that Gui Xiang was actually Deng's maidservant, and her appearance was not attractive. Deng wanted to give her to the tea room, but no one wanted her. How could he want to rape her? However, Gui Xiang insisted that she was summoned by Wang to the upstairs and raped. Court President Yu then questioned the witnesses who were summoned and said that the age of the victim must be verified, so he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled.</p>
<h3>A Group of Beggars Viciously Assaulted and Killed a Man</h3>
<p>Was He Really Killed by Falling?</p>
<p>Hou Ziyun, 69 years old, from Nantong, and Shen Lianfu, Zhang Hongkui, and Jin Hongkou, also from the same village, were all members of a gang of beggars. Shen rented a bungalow at No. _ Wu _ Li, Hutai Road, Zhabei, as a place for the beggars to live, and he also collected rent. Hou owed rent and did not pay, so he had an argument with Shen yesterday and they grabbed and punched each other. Hou Ziyun immediately fell to the ground, stopped breathing, and died. Zhang and Jin went to the Fourth District Police Station to report and testify. The police arrested Shen Lianfu. Shen claimed that the deceased fell down from the upstairs and died. Because the statements of the two sides differed, the order was given to take them to the science section for further interrogation, and the local official Wang Shaoting was ordered to report the case to the Local Court. Prosecutor Wu was appointed to arrive at the scene for an examination.</p>
<h3>Xie Baofeng Became Seriously Ill in the Toilet and Died After Being Sent to the Hospital for Treatment</h3>
<p>Autopsy Results Showed Suspicion of Poisoning</p>
<p>Xie Baofeng, also known as _ Yi, 28 years old, from Suzhou, was a silk merchant in his hometown. Recently, he had _ to go to Shaoxing. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at around 2:00 p.m., after finishing his business, he _ back and took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Shanghai alone. He checked into Room 63 of the Yuanyuan Hotel at No. 153 Jiujiang Road. Unexpectedly, upon arriving at the hotel, the tea servant Ma Fuhai saw that he was ill in the toilet. The tea servant immediately reported to the accounting room, and they sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly thereafter. The hospital reported it to the Old Gate Police Station, who ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was requested to appoint Prosecutor _ Yaoguang to arrive at the scene to examine the body. He ascended to the official seat and questioned Xie's father, _ Yun _, who _ to _, living in Suzhou. He said, "Last night, I learned about it through a _ report from the hotel, so I rushed here to collect the body. My son went to Shaoxing to sweep the tomb this time. He was not ill when he left, and he was very frugal on weekdays. Now that he has died, I request that an autopsy be waived." The tea servant Ma Fuhai also gave a statement about the circumstances at the time. Zhang Junde testified, "Upon examination, the deceased Xie Junyi _ _, and there is suspicion that he died from poisoning during his lifetime. It is still difficult to determine what poison he was exposed to because the family members did not want an autopsy. The body was handed over to his father, Xie Yunbao, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial."</p>
<h3>Records of the Interrogation of the Bandits in the Kidnapping Case of Wang Zilin's Young Son</h3>
<p>A Date Is Set for the Announcement of the Judgment After the Hearing</p>
<p>Wang Zilin, a native of Weihaiwei, residing at No. 722 Weihaiwei Road, is a leader in the Shanghai Municipal Council and has a comfortable family life. His four-year-old son, Fuhai, is lively and cute, and Wang cherishes him like a pearl. Unexpectedly, at 5:45 a.m. on the seventh morning of the fourth lunar month of last year, several kidnappers broke in, went upstairs, and kidnapped Fuhai. They also shot and killed the concubine Li Tao, and Wang Zilin was also shot in the leg. Later, the gang sent a letter demanding a large ransom. The location was in Haimen Township. Wang had no choice but to pay 10,000 yuan to buy Fuhai back. Later, the detectives of the Hongkou Police Station, Bao Shuji and Wang Zhusheng, the detective chief Shi Enjian, and the detectives of the Yangshupu Police Station successively arrested the kidnappers from Yancheng, Wang Xiaosizi Jiang Shihua, Fang Shulin, and fourteen others, and sent them to the First Special District Court. Those who were found to be unrelated were released. Wang and the other three were re-examined by the adjudicator Wu Ze _ yesterday afternoon. The lawyer for the police station, Zhang Tianyin, said that the police station was prosecuting the three defendants in accordance with Article 1, Section 1, and Article 285, Section 1, of the Law on Punishing Bandits for murder, and Section 2 for attempted murder. Wang Xiaosizi Jiang Shihua and others had completely confessed to the charges at the police station and accompanied the detectives to the victim's house to demonstrate the various circumstances of the kidnapping, and the blue car was parked on the east side of the Yongqingli intersection. The car belonged to a Zhao, residing at No. 65 Aivenyi Road. When the police detectives went to arrest him, he had already fled without a trace. Now the second landlord of the house can testify to this, and he has also identified the leaders Jin Rubiyi Yuting, and the accomplices surnamed Yan, Yang, Agen, and Yan's wife also went together. However, Fang Shulin and the two defendants, Wang and Jiang, were taken there by two faction leaders and did not know each other. Before the incident, at around 7:00 p.m. on April 25, Jin and Bi _ led them to hold a joint meeting in Room 8 of the Zhongnan Hotel at No. 345 Mintiniying Road in the French Concession. Afterwards, the two defendants, Wang and Jiang, each received 240 yuan, and Fang received 50 yuan. However, he was arrested by the Yangshupu Police Station for another case and confessed to the case. All the confessions related to this case are the same as the confessions made by the two defendants, Wang and Jiang, at the Hongkou Police Station. The victim was present and understood the confessions when the three defendants were recording their confessions at the police station, and he is also present in court today. Wang Zilin and his lawyer, Zhou Xiaoan, stated that the bandits entered while the maid Li Tao was emptying the chamber pot. The young son Fuhai was sleeping with his mother-in-law in the adjacent room upstairs. One bandit went upstairs, took the child from the bed and carried him downstairs, and the mother-in-law warned him. He got up and went downstairs.</p>
<p>He saw two bandits taking out guns and threatening them to remain silent. The maid was shot and killed for looking around. His leg was also shot. The child was carried out of the back door by the bandits. Later, the three defendants admitted their confessions at the police station. He understood clearly, but at the time he was frightened and could not identify the faces of the bandits. His words still showed fear and his sentences trembled. Lawyer Zhou Chen substituted. According to Lu Jincai, who lived at No. 65 Aivenyi Road, _ the landlord, there was indeed a tenant surnamed Zhao living there, and there was a blue-topped car, which was often parked in the back door. It was said that the car was for hiring customers to ride in. He had a wife and two children. During the third month of the lunar calendar last year, they suddenly moved to another place. When questioned, the three defendants, Wang and others, completely overturned their police confessions and previous admissions in court. The court read out the previous confessions in detail, questioned them strictly for a long time, put forward key points, and criticized them for being cunning, but one defendant still stammered. After the presiding judge Wu appointed a lawyer to defend the defendants and the police lawyer, he ordered the three defendants to be returned to custody and a date was set for the announcement of the judgment.</p>

<h3>Reader's Advisor</h3>
<h3>Problem of Changing Professions (1)</h3>
<p>| Letter from Mr. Wu |</p>
<p>I am a young man with weak will and lacking in ability. Because I want to solve my livelihood problem, when I was fifteen years old, I abandoned what I liked and left my hometown for a shop in a town thousands of miles away to become an apprentice! Of course, I have great hopes for my career. I want to struggle through my apprenticeship! Every day I do some sweeping work, which is of course the hardship that we young people should endure. I want to steal a little free time from these tasks to learn writing and abacus skills, which are essential in the business world. However, reality does not allow you to do this! Now, my three-year apprenticeship is over, and the resulting price is that my back is injured from carrying heavy objects. Now I think, I wanted to learn all the knowledge of business, so why didn't he allow me to? If he doesn't allow me, then don't I have no job? Then isn't my time wasted in vain? I have no knowledge at all, where in society is there a place for me to stand? I think that if I continue to learn like this, even if I learn until old age, wouldn't I still be the same as before? Rather than that, I think it's better to change careers early. But I don't have any knowledge of other careers. I think I can work as a tea server, and I can still get a little salary every month to support my family. I am writing to ask for your guidance, do you think my plan is good?</p>
<p>Answer: Apprentices in the old days didn't learn much, except to be slaves to the shop owner and senior staff. This was the common situation. As for writing and abacus skills, they all depended on the apprentice's own "seeing and feeling," flattering an accountant or clerk, and asking them to teach them in their spare time, in order to have a chance to gain some skills. If you think you are learning business and are waiting for the shop owner or the shop staff to automatically teach you, then you have made a mistake. You may have suffered a loss because of this. If you want to earn a few coins immediately to "support your family," it may be okay to change careers to be a tea server, if the tea server can earn a few coins more than a newly graduated apprentice. As for learning, that is another issue. However, the tea server may be a little more relaxed than the apprentice, and may be able to steal some time to study, which is unknown, and it depends on how much you struggle.</p>

<h3>Shandong Department of Education Orders Schools to Strictly Enforce Examinations</h3>
<p>(Jinan, February 11th) The Shandong Department of Education, noting that in the recent middle school graduation examinations, many students had four or five subjects failing, or all subjects failing, has specifically ordered all public and private middle schools in the province to strictly enforce examinations for students in their daily work, in accordance with departmental regulations.</p>
<h3>Informal Discussion on Educational Inspection in the Capital by Ministry of Education Personnel</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent secretaries, counselors, supervisors, and others to jointly inspect national, provincial, and municipal primary and secondary schools and social education institutions, as well as private primary and secondary schools, in the capital for a period of three months. The work has now been completed. Yesterday, a reporter interviewed the inspection personnel. According to them, a total of 30 secondary schools were inspected (schools for the descendants of martyrs, the Central University Experimental School, provincial, municipal, and private middle schools), more than 70 public and private primary schools, more than 10 public and private kindergartens, several social education institutions, and several private schools.</p>
<h3>Financial Aspects</h3>
<p>In addition to the national Central University, provincial and municipal middle schools and schools for the descendants of martyrs have a total of more than 370,000 yuan, private middle schools have more than 560,000 yuan, including more than 60,000 yuan in subsidies, provincial and municipal primary schools have more than 690,000 yuan, and private primary schools have about 100,000 yuan, including more than 30,000 yuan in subsidies. Compared with the statistics before 1927, there has been rapid progress. However, the city lacks a foundation. The municipal government has established a foundation committee. In accordance with Chairman Dai Jitao's plan to raise funds, the current national crisis makes it difficult to achieve the desired results, and alternative sources of funding must be found. The city of Beijing originally had a plan to add 25 schools, but due to school building problems, difficulty in finding land, and a lack of construction funds, it is better to expand the existing schools' grades. It is heard that more than ten grades have already been added.</p>
<h3>Student Aspects</h3>
<p>Muscles are underdeveloped, physical education is insufficient, trachoma accounts for 70-80%, and the number of skin diseases is also alarming. Therefore, school physical education should be given special attention.</p>
<h3>School Aspects</h3>
<p>Principals are able to work hard in handling school affairs, and generally do a good job. However, there are too many meetings in municipal schools. It is advisable to reduce formal meetings and hold simple discussion meetings to save time and engage in practical work. Teachers have very few opportunities for further study at school. The municipal bureau should take advantage of the time and hold training courses for schools in different districts, once every week or two, for one or two hours each time.</p>
<h3>Equipment Aspects</h3>
<p>Most municipal schools lack adequate scientific equipment. It is best for the municipal bureau to set up a central manufacturing plant in cooperation with vocational schools, or to convert vocational schools into mechanical and woodworking departments to manufacture scientific instruments and desks and chairs for the use of various schools, thus avoiding the exclusive purchase of foreign goods, so that the rights and interests will not flow out. And vocational education is more likely to be effective in adapting to the needs of training. Also, principals should use more of their administrative office expenses to purchase specimens and scientific equipment and supplies, and buy less unnecessary items, so that over the years, the equipment will be considerable. According to the management of educational undertakings, qualifications, knowledge, experience, and service interests must all be given equal importance, especially the professional spirit. The municipal bureau should strive for prudence in the initial selection of principals. After taking office, there should not be many changes, so that the educational spirit is consistent, and efforts should be made to avoid reducing efficiency. A small number of schools hire students who are still studying in universities or middle schools as class teachers. Class teachers have many tasks and responsibilities. Even taking on extra classes is considered to be distracting, and studying at the same time is bound to be difficult. It would be less of a problem if these teachers were changed to teaching specialized subjects. As for the teachers of each school, there is no obvious lack in teaching and guidance, but private middle schools have overcrowded school buildings and a great lack of equipment, and should strive to improve. It is also heard that this inspection will not make many negative criticisms, but will provide positive guidance.</p>

<h3>City Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan's Speech "Shanghai's Education (3)"</h3>
<p>Overview of School Education and Social Education</p>
<p>(4) Normal Schools: In recent years, the number of primary schools in this city has gradually increased, and there is a great shortage of teachers, especially kindergarten and rural primary school teachers. Therefore, in 1929, a private kindergarten normal school was added, and in the academic year of 1930, a municipal rural normal school was founded. In total, the number of normal schools in the 1931-1932 academic year was one municipal school and eight private schools, totaling nine schools. The required funding was 155,879 yuan, of which the municipal normal school's funding accounted for 14,495 yuan. The number of students was 1,286, and the number of teachers was 187, naturally including staff. The equipment is similar to that of middle schools, so it will not be described in detail.</p>
<p>(5) Vocational Schools: In this city, the national vocational schools include only the National Tongji University Affiliated Mechanic School. The ministry-run schools include the Ministry of Communications-run Telecommunications School. Private schools include the Private China Vocational Middle School, Private Tongde Midwifery School, Private Zhongde Midwifery School, and Private Renhe Midwifery School, etc. The funding for the China Vocational School is the largest, about 78,580 yuan. The statistical report of vocational schools for the 1931-1932 academic year is as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Schools Number of Students Number of Faculty and Staff Amount of Funding</p>
<p>National 1 59 29</p>
<p>Ministry 1 6 25 18,000</p>
<p>Provincial 1 116 25 9,96</p>
<p>Private Registered 5 1,488 146 170,38</p>
<p>Private Unregistered 2 97 45 40,671</p>
<p>Total 2 1,746 270 288,975</p>
<p>(6) Municipal Higher Education: Higher education is talent education. If there are only primary and secondary schools but no universities, it only provides ordinary training and civic training for the general public, but lacks talent cultivation and leadership training. Shanghai has a population of 3.5 million, so primary schools must be expanded as much as possible. With the expansion of primary schools, secondary schools and normal schools must also be promoted as much as possible. However, for the purpose of cultivating talents for the country and creating leaders for society, higher education should also have the same development. Higher education in this city includes specialized schools, independent colleges, and universities. Although it is still far from our goal, it is considered to be progressing relatively quickly among the major cities in the country. However, we feel that there are too many universities and colleges in Shanghai, and the establishment of departments and faculties is somewhat duplicated, which is really uneconomical. We will now give a brief overview due to time constraints:</p>
<p>(A) Specialized Schools: There is one national specialized school in this city, with a total of 127 students, 24 faculty and staff, and funding of approximately 126,339 yuan. There are two ministry-run specialized schools in this city, with a total of 230 students, 49 faculty and staff, and a total annual funding of 162,000 yuan. There is one private registered specialized school in this city, with a total of 1,027 students, 178 faculty and staff, and an annual funding of over 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(B) Independent Colleges: There are three national independent colleges in this city, with a total of 271 students, 132 faculty and staff, and an annual funding of over 399,000 yuan. As for private registered independent colleges, there are four, with a total of 2,538 students, 217 faculty and staff, and a total annual funding of over 367,000 yuan. There are also seven private unregistered colleges, with a total of 1,623 students, 9 faculty and staff, and an annual funding of over 176,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(C) Universities: There are four national universities in this city, with a total of 1,752 students, 436 faculty and staff, and a total annual funding of over 1,415,000 yuan. There are six private registered universities in this city, with a total of 717 students, 703 faculty and staff, and a total annual funding of over 1,641,000 yuan. There are three private unregistered universities, with a total of 642 students, 163 faculty and staff, and a total annual funding of approximately 605,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(7) Municipal Science Laboratory: Due to economic limitations, the municipal primary schools in this city are naturally unable to have fully complete equipment for natural sciences. However, given China's underdeveloped material resources and the lack of popularity of natural sciences, if we want to promote science education, the departmental equipment of each school must be expanded. Therefore, the Municipal Education Bureau has specially established a municipal science laboratory to purchase specimens and machines so that students from all municipal primary schools can have the opportunity to conduct experiments.</p>
<p>The above is a general description of school education. Now, let's talk about social education.</p>
<p>In this city, we must know that it is much more difficult and arduous to work hard in the field of social education than in the field of school education. First, social education is multi-faceted and it is not easy to concentrate efforts. Second, social education is widespread, and it is not easy to popularize efforts. Third, there are many reactionary forces in social education, making it difficult to maintain its comprehensive efficiency. Fourth, invisible and inappropriate social forces are spreading everywhere due to the complexity of the social environment, making it difficult for well-regulated and good social education to have lasting effects.</p>
<p>Although our efforts may not achieve the results we desire, in any case, in order to ensure that all aspects of society receive a well-regulated and good amount of social education, whether in the active or passive aspects, we have considerable plans and facilities. Naturally, we cannot help but feel the lack of funds, the shortage of talent, and the incompleteness of plans and facilities. However, within the possible scope, we are confident that we have made considerable progress in the necessary work that should be done in recent years.</p>
<h3>Jida Opens Classes on the 13th</h3>
<p>Principal Zheng Hosted All Faculty and Staff Yesterday</p>
<p>The National Jinan University officially started school on the 6th of this month according to the lunar calendar. All students have successively paid fees and registered. The 13th will be the official start of classes.

He also reported on the various administrative and academic activities of the school in the past semester and the areas that should be actively improved in this semester. Finally, he expressed his hope that all faculty and staff would work together to develop overseas Chinese education and welcomed any opinions. He also sincerely accepted them.

<h3>Shanghai Art School Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Art School held its first school affairs meeting the day before yesterday, and decided on more than ten important proposals for the school affairs to be carried out this semester. The school also has regulations for awarding free tuition to poor students. Students whose families are indeed poor and whose conduct and academic performance are excellent can enjoy this semester. It has been approved that Li Zhengxing, Liu Linwu, Feng Zishu, Lu Rongyang, and Miao Maoxun will be exempted from all fees, and Sun Mingquan, Wang Shaoluo, Jiang Yiqun, Huang Xiaoxia, Liu Yun, Lai Qiuyun, Liu Zhenchun, Liu Muguang, Sun Jisheng, and Bao Shuxian will be exempted from half fees. At a time of economic hardship, the school still provides such a free quota, which is a testament to its meticulous care for students. This semester, Vice President Wang Jiyuan also proposed at the school affairs meeting to establish a scholarship committee to award and encourage students with good character, academic integrity, and outstanding achievements, in order to provide encouragement. The school appointed Mo Yunxuan, director of the affiliated middle school, and Wu Kechang, secretary, to handle the matter. Yesterday (the 10th) at 10:00 AM, the opening ceremony was held at the Yihai Hall. President Liu Haisu delivered a speech, criticizing the slow progress of the Chinese nation because of deeply ingrained traditional concepts. He stated that those who dedicate themselves to art have the responsibility to lead society and create society, and that traditional ideas must be broken first, so that the nation's future can be hoped for. Next, Vice President Wang Jiyuan reported on the recent art movements in the world and in China, as well as the school's new facilities in the future, and encouraged the students to strive for practical work and diligent study in order to save the country from its difficulties.

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Adana Models Paraded in the Streets</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>This joke is really something: In the women's bathhouse in Adana, Turkey, because someone spread rumors about the building collapsing, many female bathers were so frightened that they staged a funny scene of models parading in the streets. Reuters teletype spread the news to countries around the world. This is not only a mockery of the world, but simply a laughingstock of the world.</p>
<p>I remember that last year, there was a fire in a bathhouse in Nanjing, and it seemed that there was also a funny scene of male models parading in the streets. However, this was a local joke, and Reuters teletype did not spread the news to countries around the world. Both are model parades. Why does the female parade have the value of being spread by Reuters to countries around the world? This is a very interesting question, perhaps containing some philosophy of life and social psychology?</p>
<p>The rumor-monger was a female bather. She tricked the other female bathers into running away without taking their personal protective items. She then unceremoniously swept away everyone's clothes and fled. Everyone said she was playing a prank, but I say: She is not playing a prank, she is the commander of the total mobilization of laughter for countries around the world!</p>
<p>Turkish-style bathing is very fashionable in Shanghai, and it also has a long history in Europe. Last year, Dr. Huijin, director of the British Museum in London, discovered the bathrooms of the Roman Empire more than 1,700 years ago during archaeological excavations. There were complete hot air pipes leading to the walls, and the interior layout and Turkish-style bathroom equipment were similar. This shows the long history of Turkish-style bathing. However, in this long "bathing history" of more than 1,700 years, it is probably not easy to find a similar scene of female models parading in the streets.</p>
<p>This is a once-in-a-millennium funny scene, so it has the value of being spread by Reuters to countries around the world.</p>
<h3>The Gravitational Pull of the Earth</h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>From the perspective of "quantity," people are most unequal: Bank bosses print out countless colorful banknotes, build Western-style houses, ride in automobiles, take concubines, order people around with arrogance, and command respect. Even their farts are complimented as fragrant. Rickshaw pullers brave wind and snow, pulling people around all day long, yet they can't earn even a dime or two. They might even be rewarded with a few slaps by the police, which is a common occurrence. Then there are the laborers who climb to the tops of ten-story buildings for a few dimes in wages; if they're not careful and fall, turning into mincemeat, their deaths go unavenged. Architects, however, merely talk and point, designing blueprints, seemingly unconcerned about the sacrifices of these laborers. As for writers, they rack their brains and pour out their heart's blood, becoming severely neurasthenic, writing at most four to five thousand words every two days and receiving twenty to thirty yuan in compensation. Ultimately, they keep writing day after day, shortening their lifespans. Yet, plump capitalists can effortlessly gain ten or a hundred thousand with a phone call or a verbal command. From the perspective of "quantity," are people truly equal?</p>
<p>Nowadays, people believe in Einstein's theory of relativity and no longer believe in Newton's theory of gravity. From the perspective of the current state of society, Einstein's theory of relativity naturally holds sway. However, Newton's theory of gravity is indeed an eternal truth that cannot be broken. For example, we struggle for food and clothing, toiling our entire lives just to avoid hunger and cold. This is called "struggling to death." But even wealthy people with plenty of food and clothing only eat three meals a day and sleep one night. Although they don't have to live like beasts of burden, they can live a comfortable "pig-like life." This is called "waiting to die," and the outcome is no different from ours. Who doesn't know that Tao Zhu, Yi Dun, Deng Tong, and Shi Chong were wealthy men? But today, who among them hasn't been pulled into the earth by gravity, becoming a mound of yellow earth, forever sleeping? Alas! Newton's theory can be said to be "the most equal axiom."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Night Talk: The Greatness of the "Little Man" (Illustration)</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>After dinner, chatting with friends to kill time is too boring. Flipping through the works of great writers that I bought but haven't read requires sharpening a knife before cutting and reading, which is too much trouble. Stretching and yawning, preparing to sleep, I'm afraid of indigestion and think of castor oil. Neither left nor right works, so I decide to take a stroll on the road and appreciate the greatness of the urban night.</p>
<p>Strange, in less than three minutes, the customers have already covered a table with colorful banknotes. Being so generous and throwing money away, if someone went to donate to disaster relief, there would be no shortage of hope. Great is the generosity of gamblers.</p>
<h3>On the Way to Chuansha</h3>
<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>The municipal ferry, like a giant sea turtle, belching black smoke, cuts through the yellow and沉沉 waves, striving to leave the Bund, carrying my heart and shooting like an arrow towards the eastern shore.</p>
<p>The fresh air and warm breeze on the water envelop the boat. Leaning against the railing, I watch the silver waves, the giant buildings of the city, the bustling crowds, and the smoke billowing from the red chimneys on the plains. I realize that the world is constantly in turmoil, and all life is breathing.</p>
<p>Green trees and crops are full of spring smiles. People's cheeks are reddened by the sunlight, singing in the social groups. Even if it's a song of sorrow and pain, this sorrow and pain is a treasure of life, and I will never give it up.</p>
<p>Soon, the red walls of "Qingning Temple" jumped into view. Disembarking from the boat, I quickly boarded a small light train, rolling forward on the scattered stone tracks. Like a camel, the train carried us as we leisurely viewed the rural scenery: oxen sleeping in the grass, white sheep scattered in the fields, children riding on dogs, geese and ducks floating on the water...</p>
<p>Getting off at "Muzi Bridge," I switched to a small fishing boat to visit a friend. The sound of oars entered the reed flower harbor, and a deep river stretched before me. Suddenly, a small boat flew past, the red shirts of the village girls reflected on the emerald green spring water, so bright, so beautiful, yet fleeting so quickly.</p>
<p>Under the dim streetlights, I looked out at the sidewalks, filled with living model girls dressed in red silk and green brocade.</p>
<p>Strangely, these enchanting and charming girls are said to have transformed into "wild chickens" in the eyes of Shanghainese men. It is said that these wild chickens are the great benefactors of venereal disease doctors, because they mysteriously cultivate venereal disease seeds on the bodies of "wild chicken hunters," like farmers cultivating excellent fruits, so that "wild chicken hunters" naturally take care of the venereal disease doctors' wealth. Logically speaking, "wild chicken hunters," whose bodies and hair are received from their parents, should not generously allow the wild chickens to experiment with venereal disease seed cultivation. However, the fact that the sidewalks are full of living model girls proves the large number of "wild chicken hunters" who are willing to sacrifice everything. Great is the spirit of the "wild chicken hunter."</p>
<p>As I was admiring the greatness of the "wild chicken hunter's" spirit, nodding and sighing with emotion, I met an old friend whom I hadn't seen in a long time. He took me to a gambling den at "Number 217," which was neither too big nor too small. I squeezed through the gamblers and glanced at the table, only to see colorful banknotes piled up. A burst of shouts and cheers swept away the clouds, and the winnings went into the pockets of the gambling den owner. It was so lively...</p>
<p>Then came the silent, lonely village, and the faint chirping of nameless birds in the cypress forest, crisp and melodious. Letting the sound of the oars stop, the fishing boat drifted in the middle of the river. The sun was warm, the wind was gentle, and the world was so peaceful. By the time we reached Chuansha City, it was already dusk.</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Photograph</h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>"He's dead, how could there be so much blood if he wasn't dead?"</p>
<p>"That's right. This guy is definitely dead... Haha, you guys want to be fierce, huh? You were so powerful the night before, what's wrong today?... We didn't even use much effort, just a small trick, and we sent you all to your ancestors'... Haha, when you get to the underworld, tell the volunteer soldiers who paved the way in detail... Haha..." The enemy, laughing and speaking, kicked Zhang Rongji's head hard twice, and he immediately fainted.</p>
<p>At this time, the snow was falling harder and harder than before, and the roaring wind was blowing even stronger. The snow fell on the fresh blood, turning into red snow. But soon, the bright red blood was all covered by the white snow, and there was no trace of blood on the ground, as if there had never been a massacre, a major bloodshed here. Zhang Rongji was slowly awakened by the wind. He could no longer hear any human voices except for the whistling wind. He secretly raised his head, glanced around, and knew that the cruel executioners were all gone. He slowly struggled to get up, his head still throbbing with pain. He staggered and moved his limbs, lowered his head, and looked at the corpses with their brains split open and their flesh and blood blurred, lying all over the ground. He couldn't help but be shocked and cried like a madman, running wildly around the mountain like a fool. After running around for a while, he suddenly smelled the burnt smell of something burning. He stopped and took a closer look, realizing that he had run to the village of Pingdingshan, but the houses in the entire village had already been burned, with only embers still burning. He raised his head again and looked towards Qianjinbao and Lizigou Village: in the hazy mist, the raging fire rolled in the strong wind, as if the afterglow of the setting sun reflected the surrounding woods... (The End)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Night Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruo</p>
<p>The Little Man</p>
<p>After watching "Good Night, Vienna" at the Nanjing Grand Theatre, the electric lights on Edward VII Avenue shone like daylight. Those strings of three-lamp lampstands, hanging in the sky like the Chinese character 川, were an artificial white rainbow of tens of thousands of candles, illuminating this ever-bright city's grand avenue. How worthy of praise is the night of Shanghai!</p>
<p>I walked alone on the sidewalk, my ears not retaining the melody of the "Good Night, Vienna" song, my mind still filled with the images of laughter and song, wine and women. I had dreamed of Vienna, that "city of laughter and love, a paradise full of romantic atmosphere," for ten years. On the silver screen, I had satisfied my spiritual travels once.</p>
<p>Arriving at the most magnificent area of the French Concession, that area where three model streets converged in a 工-shape; the two horizontal and parallel Avenues Joffre and Route Pichon resembled the Chinese character "二," and the vertical Avenue Amiral Courbet in the middle resembled the 丨-stroke. These three roads commemorating great generals, great lawyers, and great archbishops were truly good places for pedestrians to take a stroll!</p>
<p>Several dozen "Silver Dragons" and "Renault" brand cars, large and small, were parked in front of the French Club, which looked like ivory or a palace of the Jade Emperor. Inside the revolving door, the back of a French girl disappeared. In front of the fourteen-story skyscraper-like building, a tall and long-bodied White Russian gatekeeper paced back and forth in front of the Cathay Apartments, bored to death. In front of the Lyceum Theatre and the Cathay Theatre, the red and green neon lights dazzled the eyes. The 5:30 show had just ended, and the 9:15 late show had not yet started. Not a single man or woman was to be seen, only the portrait of Greta Garbo with long eyelashes on the advertisement, a seductive facial expression that made one's heart flutter.</p>
<p>Across from the tennis lawn on Avenue Joffre, a café had the German words "Little Man" written on its large glass window. Feeling the need to rest, I pushed the door open and went in.</p>
<p>The coffee seats were arranged in a very modern style. Sitting in the semi-circular leather armchair felt extraordinarily comfortable and pleasant. The walls were lit with golden lights. A tall and slender girl, dressed like a alabaster statue, came over to greet me. I casually ordered a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>"Are you from Vienna?" Because I saw the "Little Man's" decoration, which had a Viennese flavor, I asked her this question in German when the waitress brought the coffee pot and cup.</p>
<p>She smiled and replied in German, "I am from Berlin."</p>
<p>My knowledge of German is very limited. Although I recently met a young man from Vienna, Professor Luo Yimin, who now teaches German at Jiaotong University, he is fluent in Chinese. When we meet, we both speak Chinese. This young professor from Austria, although he grew up in Vienna, doesn't have a fluent Beijing accent. I haven't had the opportunity to learn German with him, so I have things to say in my heart, but I can't say them with my mouth. I have no way to communicate with that waitress from Berlin.</p>
<p>That Greek statue-like waitress wore a coffee-colored woolen robe, her brown-yellow hair combed neatly, her serene expression like a classical sculpture. She sat silently by the counter, one of her fair and clean hands supporting her chin, looking at the beautiful candy boxes in the glass cabinet, lost in thought. Looking at a beauty under the lights is such a poetic and serene picture!</p>
<p>The radio was broadcasting a Viennese song from "Congress Dances": "It's a pity it's only such a today; it will never be encountered again in the future! This ideal reality is too noble! Like a golden light in the heavenly palace..."</p>
<p>I sat alone in the "Little Man's" leather armchair, feeling both lonely and bored. I paid the bill, and as I walked out the door, the waitress from Berlin said "Thank you" in French, MERCI. I also replied to her in French, "Good night, goodbye," BON SOIR, AU REVOIR.</p>
<p>The Paris Theatre was showing "The Congress Dances." I spent another two hours of the lovely Shanghai night in the dark world.</p>
<p>Vienna and wine: laughter and singing: Shanghai and movies: coffee and waitresses: this is the nightlife of a big city!</p>

<p>Gold Market Slightly Up, Winds Unabated</p>
<p>Continued Rise of Two or Three Taels, Demand Still Exceeds Supply</p>
<p>Swap Spreads Are Thin, No Counterparties, No Transactions</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market gold prices were quite calm in the previous session. Because of foreign wire reports, London spreads narrowed by 1.25 for both near and far dates. British-American exchange rose by 0.25, American-British exchange rose by 0.125, New York silver prices fell slightly by 0.025, forward silver prices fell by 0.016 to 0.02. American cotton rebounded by 5-6 points. Although bank private wires fell by 0.125, there was not much supply. Retail investors were strongly selling, but because Hengxing was the first to enter, the opening price rose slightly to 800.008 taels. But because retail investors were mostly short, the price was very resistant, first reaching 800.003 taels. Later, because the exchange rate slightly rose, large investors came to drag the price up, reaching 800.03 taels. Union Trans suddenly blocked May US dollars at 28.375, already hard at 0.0625, then returned to around 800 taels. It once broke into the customs, reaching 799.7 taels. Although HSBC's listing was , it had no effect. Afterwards, it fell to around 800 taels twice, partly due to the selling pressure from retail investors. Finally, because Citibank and Hua Bi both absorbed May US dollars at 28.375, the price gradually rose, closing in the morning at 802.3 taels. The afternoon opening was 803 taels, although it reached 2.7, the trend was still upward. Large investors were eager to buy, and 　some covered shorts. January-March US dollars were once traded at 18.0625. Bombay telegrams reported that near-term prices fell slightly, and far-term prices rose slightly without much volatility. It once rose to 804.8 taels, especially with Yuan Maoyong dragging the most. And 　there was gold industry buying US dollars, and 　issuing notes, so it saw a slight downward trend. Nearing the close, because Bombay telegrams reported a rise, it fell to 03.3 taels. Before long, the close was at 803.5 taels. It was found that the market conditions were calm throughout the day, and trading was still active. 　There were no transactions in futures, and only premium rates were heard, about 3.5 taels, slightly higher than the previous day. Due to the high price, the short side and the long side were not interested due to the lack of goods, so Xing烚赤were in the same boat with no formal counterparties. The Central Bank's spot opening did not see a huge scene. In the afternoon, HengxingHui recognized and advanced more than a hundred notes, with prices ranging from 3.5 to 4 taels. The day's 　market conditions are divided and recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Morning Market</h3>
<p>The morning opening was at 800 taels and 0.008 qian. People's hearts seemed unsatisfied due to the falling silver prices, so it was not stable. Although Hengxing advanced the notes, the opening price was slightly higher than the previous close by 0.003 qian, but retail investors were strongly selling, and the price immediately fell to 0.003 qian. 　The market opened with recent bid prices of two shillings, seven pence, and six two five for British exchange, and twenty-eight yuan for US exchange, both slightly tighter than the previous close. Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu and 　came to advance notes, once reaching 01.8 taels. But at this time, the exchange rate opened tightly.　This time, HSBC was willing to sell at six eight seven five for this month, and Yuanheng then came and　　, continuing to re-enter within one or two, at 00.5 qian.　Fayong, Yuan Maoyong, and Hengxing came to advance to about two taels. Fuchang and Yuanheng escaped, while Fenghchang released more than three taels. Zhejiang resisted advancing March US dollars at one three five. Fuchang and Dadecheng also bought. Mitsui absorbed May US dollars at three one two five, improving to 03 taels.　Fengh, Yongqing, Fayong, Hengyu slightly disposed of at two and a half taels, continuing to retreat to about two taels. May US dollars at three one two five were not easy to dispose of, and Hengyu again sold to within 02 taels. Yunjin blocked the exit of May US dollars at three seven five, and Yongfeng sold notes, falling to 002 qian. Yuanmao 　advanced to outside two taels, to one tael three qian. It can be said that HSBC's listing of British exchange at minus 0.125, and US exchange at minus 0.025, was suitable for this time's　扬　also. But Zhifengyong and others suddenly came 　out, and Dadecheng also sold, breaking the 800 tael mark, reaching 799.7 qian. The exchange market remained flat. Citibank absorbed May US dollars at three seven five, and Hengyu advanced notes, breaking out of the 800 tael mark, reaching 005 qian. Yuanheng advanced slightly, to about one tael. Fuxingyong also advanced, to 011.3 qian. It was no match for the retail investors who were all short-positioned. The large investors were slightly quiet at this time, so they rotated back to within one tael. There were not many transactions. Retail investors showed courage and once retreated to 800 taels and 001 qian. Hua Bi advanced May US dollars at three seven five, and Hengyu also paid, reaching about one tael. Fuyu set a limit price of one tael and sold, and retail investors took advantage of the momentum to　the price twice, retreating to 001 qian. Shunlai came to advance, gradually pulling up. Magali also absorbed May US dollars at three seven five, and Yifeng　purchased notes, so it was issued at one tael. Moreover, Qianchangxiang and Dadecheng competed to advance, to one and a half taels. Although Wanxing and Yuanheng came to sell slightly, there was no movement. Qianchangxiang came again to pay notes, plus March US dollars at two two five were not easy to settle, reaching outside two taels. Dadecheng and Hengyu also advanced, reaching 03.6 qian, but soon retreated by 0.003 qian, to 802.3 taels. Goods were also photographed at the same price. After the close, buying interest was still strong, once reaching two seven eight qian.</p>
<h3>Afternoon Market</h3>
<p>The afternoon opening was immediately high at 803 taels. Goods opened at 802.8 taels, with a slight set out, reaching 2.7 qian. Except for US dollars, the exchange market's bid price was the same. The six two five for the current month of the shilling seemed difficult to settle. Fuyu　advanced, and it spiraled upwards to 03.9 qian. Shengda came to sell off, and Hua Bi sold April US dollars</p>
<p>at 1875, so it was smart to sell to within three taels, reaching 2.8 qian. It lingered around three taels. Yuan Maoyong and Hengyu advanced to 3.3 qian, Qianchangxiang came to release, still at three taels. Goods, Dadecheng, and Qianchangxiang suddenly advanced, improving one tael. Magali absorbed April US dollars at one eight seven five, and Bingxing came to cover shorts again. Yuan Maoyong continued to absorb notes, and Citibank 扖 March US dollars at 0625. Zhaofenghchang also purchased, raising the price to 804.8 taels. Thereafter, Bombay telegrams reported small rises and falls, so it generally spiraled outside of four taels. And then　Fayong and Hengxing came to sell notes, reaching within four taels. Hengxing even sold to 3.6 qian, and Yuan Maoyong met at this time and paid quite a lot. Yuan Maoyong even set a limit of 3.5 qian and advanced, so the price returned up. Fuchang came to advance to about four taels. Hua Bi absorbed February shillings at six two five, and Fuyu advanced notes, rising to 4.3 qian. Thereafter, transactions were extremely flat, with occasional rises and falls of several jian for a long time. And until Fudeheng, Yuanshengyong came to sell to within four taels, and Bombay telegrams reported a rise. Hengyu 　released, and it spiraled down, reaching 3.3 qian. Hengxing Shang場advanced notes, and saw a rebound again. It was already near the close at this time, and before long, it closed at a price of 803.5 qian. Goods slightly increased, photographing at 803.8 qian. The highest price in the city was found to be 804.8 taels, and the lowest was 799.7 qian. Although it once broke into the 800 tael mark, it was still able to rebound with remaining strength, which was extremely stable. The rise and fall was only 5.1 qian throughout the day, and as a result, it rose by three taels compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Revealed Prices</h3>
<p>Because the US exchange listing was down 0.025, calculated at 27.75 yuan, with 24000合gold standard gold price of 864.86 qian, about 61余 taels in terms of closing price, which is more than 4 taels stronger than the previous close. 　Current month registered 803 taels, March registered 802 taels, morning supplement water 804 taels, afternoon 806 taels.</p>
<h3>Transactions</h3>
<p>Transactions on the table were still good, counting Yuan Maoyong, Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Fenghchang, Fuxingyong, Bingxing, Zhaofenghchang, Yuanxinyong, Ruikang, Runchangyong, Wanxing all advancing.

The Guangdong gang Hengxing roughly advanced more than a hundred in the morning, and then roughly released more than a hundred in the afternoon. Shengda did not have many transactions in the morning, and released more than a hundred notes in the afternoon. Statistics show that the city is still an image of demand exceeding supply.</p>
<h3>烚赤</h3>
<p>Yesterday was still lifeless, with a lack of buying and selling in the塲. 　Each other did things among同行to perfunctorily, counting the addition of 12.5 taels. Yingfeng Heng sold to Tongfenghheng, and less than a hundred taels were traded evenly.</p>
<h3>Swap</h3>
<p>There were no transactions yesterday, because there was still a shortage of spot goods. It was heard that the premium was roughly around 3.5 qian. Most 多方generally only had Tongfenghheng with a slight position, and 空方were heard that Hengxing still had a small number that had not been properly swapped.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Markets: Open and Dark Markets Tight, Extremely Rare Transactions</h3>
<p>There were not many transactions in the exchange market. The morning opening was because the foreign wire report's London wide條had recent and far periods both narrowed by 0.225, and the exchange rate saw a slight rise. It was counted that British-American exchange rose by 0.025, and American-British rose by 0.125. Therefore, the opening price of British exchange was a recent bid price of one shilling, seven pence, and six two five, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous close. New York silver prices narrowed by 0.025, and bank private wires only fell by 0.125. The far period silver price of the Five Metals Exchange fell by 0.026 to 0.02.

After the opening, the shilling once declined. HSBC once sold this month's six eight seven five. HSBC listed British小0.125, US小0.025, so the US exchange was always flat, sometimes with 0.0625上下, only the spiraling result was still balanced.

<h3>Money Market Officially Opens Afternoon Session</h3>
<p>Li Split early and noon are identical... Copper coins contract wind more often</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Market</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the money market at the beginning of the lunar new year, only the morning session has been conducted, and the afternoon session trading has been temporarily suspended. This was originally a common practice every year. This year, due to the inconvenience of buying and selling by the banks, the afternoon session was opened earlier after the Lantern Festival. In fact, the market has not yet been activated, and the use of silver dollars is still in a state of quietness. Because there is no need to open the session, although the afternoon session trading has already started yesterday, the trading situation is not as prosperous as the morning session in a single day. From this, we can see the approximate bleakness of the recent market.</p>
<h3>Li Split Same Price</h3>
<p>Because there were few transactions in the "Foreign Li" morning session and no competition, the resulting Li price was similar to the previous day, slightly better by 1 hao 2 hu and a half, settling at 7 qian 1 fen 4 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half. Unexpectedly, there were even fewer transactions in the afternoon session and even less competition, resulting in no change in the Li price, remaining the same as the morning session at 7 qian 1 fen 4 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half. Both the morning and afternoon sessions of "Silver Split" opened with white lending. The looseness of the silver market and the scarcity of its use are unprecedented facts of the year's slack season. The head drawings are also drawn in white.</p>
<h3>Copper Coin Heavy Currency</h3>
<p>The currency market saw Jiangnan small foreign coins rise early and weaken in the afternoon. The morning session was 6 qian 2 fen 5 li, and the afternoon session was 6 qian 2 fen, a difference of 5 li, which was 3 li less than the previous day. The morning session saw 8,000 jiao transactions, and the afternoon session saw 2,000 jiao. The Guangdong small foreign coins fluctuated only slightly, rising and falling by only 3 hao and a half. The morning session was 5 qian  fen 1 li and a half, and the afternoon session was 5 qian 9 fen 1 li and 7 hao and a half. Copper coins inexplicably contracted, and even severely. The difference between the two sessions was as much as 8,000 wen. Yesterday, it contracted again by 4,500 wen, to 414,000 wen, with 45,600 strings of wen traded.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollars Calm</h3>
<p>The amount of "Silver Funds" collected yesterday was probably better than in the past. China Merchants Bank collected 1.8 to 1.9 million in bill funds, foreign banks collected over 1.9 million in bill funds, telegraphic transfers were over 500,000, whole funds collected were over 1.3 million, special funds collected were between 2.6 to 2.7 million, mortgage transactions were over 1.1 million, and various goods tax miscellaneous funds collected were between 6.5 to 6.6 million, with 600,000 going into warehouses and 300,000 leaving. Qianzhuang silver public collected over 26 million.  Head funds collected were over 3.7 million, various remittance funds were over 700,000, and cash transfers were over 400,000. For "Foreign Funds," morning session bill transfers were not many, only 450,000, with 60,000 within the note market and 25,000 outside. Check transactions were 60,000. Afternoon session bill transfers were 175,000, notes were 20,000, notes outside the market were 50,000, and checks were 10,000. Bank buying and mutual markets in the morning session were also 500,000, with no transactions in the afternoon session. Qianzhuang foreign public single collections were over 4.5 million, foreign head fund transfers were over 1.5 million, borrowed foreign funds were over 1.1 million, and foreign account exchanges between banks were over 1.5 million. Note collections and issues were over 1 million. Road sources were 150,000, foreign mortgage transactions were over 500,000, and small qianzhuang incoming and outgoing transactions were over 600,000.</p>
<h3>Securities 20 Customs Fell One Yuan</h3>
<p>丨Settlement Price Weak, Prospects Difficult to Improve丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange continued to be sluggish, and popularity turned virtual. Although there were no large transactions on the floor, the eaters were still sinking, observing changes, and waiting quietly without moving. Because there was no profit to be made, the shorts were also unwilling to offset. Scattered longs were weak and withdrew one after another. Although there was no major change in market prices, the trend had become sluggish. In the morning, the first two rounds of scattered retail sales were sold. Although there were entrants, the prices were firmly held down. In addition, No. 47 also sold, and each round fell by two or three jiao. At the afternoon opening, both the opening and No. 11 were sold, and the market price continued to fall by one or two jiao. At the close, No. 32 slightly ate in, and the platform slightly temporarily shorted, rising back by one or two jiao. As a result, except for the whole six spot goods, which rose by six jiao due to the long interval, the rest all fell. Among them, the 20 Customs fell the most, about one yuan. Troop reduction and 20 rolls also fell by eight jiao, and the rest fell by two or three jiao to five or six jiao. Clear trading, weak market prices, often lead to this situation. If large households do not move, the future of market prices will be difficult to improve. Yesterday's total turnover was 4.232 million yuan, of which only 1,000 yuan each for 19 Customs and the whole six spot goods. Futures tax was 1 million, consolidated tax was over 800,000, troop reduction also had over 500,000, and the remaining various types accounted for over 1 million. Trading has not improved.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Firm</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on Thursday was getting firmer. The Union Pacific Railroad announced that dividends would remain the same. Shorts panicked and bought back the recently weak stocks, and the market rose sharply. Later, it fell slightly due to the impact of the Chicago wheat decline. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 1.08 million shares. Also, the brokers' loans announced this week totaled 427,000,000 yuan, a decrease of 32,000,000 yuan compared with the previous week. The interest rate for 60-day and 90-day bank loans was 0.5%. The Dow Jones Index is listed below,</p>
<p>Closing price Compared to the previous day</p>
<p>30 industrial stocks 60.09 Up 1.122</p>
<p>20 railroad stocks 29.47 Up 0.91</p>
<p>20 utility stocks 25.88 Up 0.50</p>
<p>40 bonds 80.54 Up 0.41</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Plain Yarn and Cotton, No Special Features</p>
<p>Since the first half of the new year, yarn sales have not been active in any state. The daily turnover in the market is only about three or four hundred bales. This situation is rare in the past, which shows the decline of domestic commerce and the difficulties of farmers' livelihoods. As for the Cantonese help, the largest consumer of Chinese yarn in Nanbu, they suffered heavy losses last year and have not yet cleared up. The financial situation is extremely tight, so the current intake is quite stagnant. After the war in Sichuan, the local area is devastated, and inferior yarn from the Yangtze River occupies the market. The shipment of local yarn from North China to Shanghai is still uninterrupted. All these situations are unfavorable to yarn sales. The future market price may be difficult to establish.</p>
<h3>Manbiao Fluctuations Very Slight</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Manbiao morning market, the rise in foreign cotton slightly boosted morale. Scattered shorts covered, and each month rose by three or four qian. In the second and third rounds, it was heard that the actual demand was not good, and then it weakened again. As a result, the near months rose by two or three qian, and the far months fell by one or two qian. The market atmosphere was still weak in the afternoon, with the near months falling by two qian and the far months rising by one, two, or three qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 21,800 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 1,700 bales, Xinhua 500 bales, Chunjie 700 bales,  Feng 500 bales, Renfeng 450 bales, and Tongji 400 bales. Jifeng bought 1,250 bales, Hengyi 800 bales, Mingde 850 bales, Ruida 500 bales, Zhenji 400 bales, and Yichang 400 bales. The closing prices are as follows,</p>
<p>Manbiao Closing Price Fluctuations Account Balance May 1453 Up 1 28,750</p>
<p>February 1422 Up 1 34,750 June 1458 Down 1</p>
<p>March 1431··· 47,350 July 1464 Up 2 6,050</p>
<p>April 1443 1 41,450 Total 175,900</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales As Numb As Before</h3>
<p>The removal of existing yarn remains sluggish. It was found that the total number of bales purchased by various gangs throughout the day was 448 bales. Prices fell by five qian to one liang. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou 45 Tianjin 5 Fujian 10 Guangdong 162</p>
<p>Anqing 9 Nanjing 10 Wenzhou 5 Ningbo 35</p>
<p>Inland 99 Xiamen 1 Fellow traders 73</p>
<p>The situation in the cotton market is slightly stable, but the situation is still weak. Because the overseas cotton market is still flat, but gold prices are firm, the morale of the longs is more stable, and the amount absorbed by most cotton merchants in the long position remains unchanged. However, the demand for spot cotton is still weak. The factories believe that the world cotton industry is still in an era of excess and that foreign cotton still has the hope of falling, so they are very slack about kapok.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao's Rising Power is Weak</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Biao morning market, the slight rise in foreign cotton caused scattered shorts to cover and longs to buy, and the market became more firm. Each month rose by two and a half qian. In the second and third rounds, it fell again due to selling pressure. As a result, it rose by five fen to one qian. In the afternoon, it rose again by five fen to one qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 42,500 dan. It was found that Yifeng sold 3,600 dan, Xiesheng 1,000 dan, Yuanda 2,300 dan, Yicheng 1,100 dan, Shenji 1,700 dan, Renfeng 1,200 dan, Suilong 1,600 dan, and Yukang 2,200 dan. Jifeng bought 3,300 dan,  Feng 3,500 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,700 dan, Mingde 1,600 dan, and Changfeng 1,000 dan. The closing prices are as follows,</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rise and Fall Account Balance May 3270 Up 15 68,100</p>
<p>February 3170 Up 05 88,500 June 2285 20 47,400</p>
<p>March 3220 15 100,700 July 3290 15 22,200</p>
<p>April 3245 20 95,000 Total 422,900</p>
<h3>Cotton Scattered and Almost Exhausted</h3>
<p>Spot cotton business is completely stagnant, and yarn sales are even more sluggish. There is absolutely no intention to buy high-priced cotton, so the daily clearance of transactions can be described as follows.</p>
<p>Fire Cotton 31.15 Yongyu Factory In 200 bales Sent to factory</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Telegrams Show Upward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was strong and active due to the good cloth market and enthusiastic buyers. Later, it weakened due to some longs taking profits. Futures rose by three to six pounds, and spot rose by ten pounds. British cotton futures rose by four points, and spot rose by two points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by four points. Indian cotton shorts covered, and the market was tight and stable. Pingguoer rose by two rupees, Omra rose by 2.25 rupees, and Bairuoxi rose by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (9th telegram)</p>

<h3>Grain Glutinous Rice Outdated, Both Fell by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Du Geng, Ke Xian, Sales Stagnant and Weak</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was more than 40 ships, and the accumulation in Pudong was still acceptable. The merchants were quite willing to sell. However, since Shanghai complied with the Shanghai Dou Standards, which was put into effect on February 1st, it has been more than a week. Yesterday, some merchants suddenly used six-dou Shanghai Standards, which caused panic among boatmen, who rejected the Shanghai Standard one after another, resulting in the stagnation of retail buyers' intake. As a result, the market fell. Changxiang, Su Tong, South Port, Qingjiao, and other rice, as well as Du Yangjian, fell by one or two jiao. Bianyuan was out of season, and the taste was bland, with the price reduced by half a yuan. Yinyuan was short of goods and tasted fragrant, and the price could still stand. Factories sold Yin Bianyuan, Ke Yuan, Ke Jian,  Jian, Xijian, Kun Geng, and other rice. The market was not very different.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 ships arrived from various gangs in Hexia. White Geng shops sold slightly at lower prices, and the market was slightly angled. The arrival of thin rice was few, and retail was not bad. The arrival of early rice was not prosperous, and sales were absolutely flat. The market was sluggish. Sheep tip arrivals were continuous, and retail was slow, with a slight decrease of one or two jiao. Du Pu's arrival was low and sales were flat, with a slight drop in price. Ke Jian was also sluggish and weak. Yinyuan was short of arrivals, Riyuan arrivals still existed, and sales were flat, with prices falling by two or three jiao again.</p>
<h3>Fujian Gang Smoothly Purchases Red Rough Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market had good digestion, but the arrival of goods continued to be strong, and the owners were seeking to sell, so the market fell. Yesterday, the Fujian Provincial City Gang had a very good intake, purchasing 2,675 bags of mixed Xiang Red Rough Rice, with prices ranging from 7.3 yuan, 7.256 yuan to 7.2 yuan. The street's taste was also fragrant, purchasing 320 bags of Hunan Machine Red Rice, with prices ranging from 8.6 yuan to 8.55 yuan. In addition, 150 bags of Jiangxi Machine Early, with prices ranging from 8.25 yuan to 8.15 yuan, and 210 bags of Machine Late, with prices ranging from 8.92 yuan to 8.65 yuan. The high grades of each rice were stable, and the middle grades were slightly lower by four or five points due to the owners' eagerness to sell. The arrival of the rear was still strong, and the situation was not stable.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Market Slightly Different</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, foreign wheat was reported to be down by one or two jiao, and people's hearts were calm and soft, and they tended to wait and see. The factories also had the intention to sell, but because the intake was not strong, they did not dare to sell. Then, the Tianjin gang collected near-month prices in the market, and the taste was very lively. However, scattered factories still sold, and the market was not very bullish, but the trading of far-month prices was very light. In the afternoon, each round was very short, and the closing price was February at 0.25 yuan, March at 0.75 yuan, April at 0.25 yuan, May at 0.25 yuan, June was unchanged, and July was 0.25 yuan.</p>
<p>The foreign news of the wheat market reported a slight decrease of one or two jiao, but after the opening, the shorts covered the near-term prices strongly, so the opening price for this month was up by two fen. Then, traders resold the foreign wheat they had bought earlier in the market in the far months, and July suddenly decreased by five fen. Therefore, after the opening in the afternoon, the near months were also slightly lowered. However, the traders stopped selling when they saw that the market price was slightly lower, so July recovered by three fen. In the end, only July was slightly lower by two fen at the close, and the prices of the other months were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yellow Soybeans Sell Better</h3>
<p>Green Beans Still Only The Guangdong Gang Has A Taste</p>
<p>Yellow soybean sales were slightly higher yesterday, and the Xiamen gang also had an intake. Zhengyang  beans were two cars, and Dalian beans were purchased by the street for two cars. In addition, four or five cars of train beans were purchased by the factories. Pudong Du Beans were purchased by the Guangdong gang on the street for more than 600 bags. Although the market transaction was active, it was still dull because the purchase was high. The green bean market was still soft, and the sales relied only on the Guangdong gang. Other gangs only had two or three hundred bags, so the market was difficult to improve. Due to the lack of arrivals, the spot wheat was stable. The oil market has not opened, and the soybean cake market needs to look at the small side.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Continued to Weaken</h3>
<p>Chicago wheat on Thursday first rose due to bad weather, and then fell due to longs taking profits. Also, 20 million bushels were traded on the 8th.</p>
<p>The market prices on the 9th are listed below,</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the previous day</p>
<p>May 48.000 Down 0.250</p>
<p>July 48.625 Down 0.250</p>
<p>September 49.875 Down 0.125</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<h3>Sugar Market Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, with the standard gold rising back to 800 taels, should have been trending well. However, the sales market has been quiet for days, and the street gangs in the Yangtze River and other places have expressed dissatisfaction with the new scale's discount issue, which has not yet been properly resolved, so transactions are even rarer. The association's price for the 24 group of white sand was called up by five points, to 15 taels and 7 qian, with no transactions. However, the industry sold hundreds of bags of Lu goods at a price of 15 taels 6 qian and 2.5 fen, which was lower than the previous market. If there are no unexpected changes in the future, there is likely to be a loosening trend. There was no change in No. 20 medium sand white and Nos. 8 and 9 Dutch red. Only 20 boxes of standard Five Blessings white ice were opened, with each price being 13 taels.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<h3>New Lead Wire Has A Sharp Increase Phenomenon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's metal trading was still lively. The street customers were interwoven and collected, and the factory building gangs also inquired a lot, so the amount of transactions in each was considerable. Due to the rise in overseas markets, prices have an upward trend. However, the situation of the new wire is even better. The local inventory is thin, and overseas prices are rising fiercely. For example, the price from the 16th to the 20th is to be 17 pounds 2 shillings and 6 pence, and the price from the 21st to the 25th is to be 22 pounds 17 shillings and 6 pence, which is higher than the local Shanghai market. For this reason, the local industry is keen on this, so they are all receiving the current quantity. Therefore, in today's market, the upward trend of one is unique. The estimated plate is rising steadily. It is estimated that the price from the 16th to the 20th is 12 taels and 7.5 qian, and the price from the 21st to the 25th is 19 taels and 2.5 qian. The coarse color is about 10 taels. A total of one thousand and several hundred bundles were opened yesterday, and it was found that the Changjiang gang purchased them.</p>

<h3>Tramps</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>We deceive neither Heaven nor Earth, we are all 'Three Lights' guys.</p>
<p>What kind of 'Three Lights'? Eat it all! Use it all! Pawn it all!</p>
<p>Our ways of making a living are: begging, gambling on the ground, overturning coffins, pretending to have accurate aim, shaking the road, pushing rickshaws across bridges.</p>
<p>Today, we are lucky! Early in the morning, as soon as I went out for a stroll, I struck it rich, I bumped into a young man in a Western suit, with a girl of eighteen or nineteen clinging to his arm. That girl was wearing a leather coat, and a large section of a blood-red cheongsam was exposed below the coat, with a pair of high heels, clicking with each step, really flashy! Damn! The weather is so cold, and my worn-out clothes have several holes, the cold wind whistling and trying to get into the holes, making my whole body shiver and feel uncomfortable. This kid, he's having a good time, the couple squeezing together tightly, their eyes seeming to grow on their foreheads, not glancing at anyone else at all. I glanced at this kid, and I felt very uncomfortable in my heart, intending to provoke him, to argue with him. They went east, and I stuck to them going east, they went west, and I stuck to them going west. Believe it or not, I guessed that this couple must have been so lovey-dovey that they were confused, and as I stuck to them like that, they gave me a coin on the left, and a coin on the right, giving me a large pile. Finally, this kid realized what was going on, stomped his foot, and shouted at me:</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Get lost!"</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders, spat, and muttered: "It's cheap for you, you little bastard, I'm not going to cut the tops off your boots." Then I walked away.</p>
<p>My stomach is also acting up! Without money, it's silent, but as soon as it's near money, it growls and rumbles non-stop. I was just thinking of buying two fried dumplings to eat with the money from that tall Shandong man's pancake stall, but for some reason, suddenly, "Achoo! Achoo!" two sneezes came one after another, and tears and snot came in a large stream with yawns. Oh! Good heavens! My opium addiction is acting up! I couldn't care less about being hungry, I quickly ran to a small sundries store near Chaoyangmen in a few strides, bought a few opium pellets, two or three pieces of dirt skin, and hastily swallowed them, which barely satisfied my addiction. But, as a result, all the money I had just begged for was gone!</p>
<p>What to do? I have to think of a way! This stomach keeps causing me trouble, taking care of the dark rice, and the white rice is left empty, there are always times when a hunchback falls, and neither side is solid. I squatted at the sundries store near Chaoyangmen, my mind running through a lot of ideas, but none of them were feasible. The weather is so cold, and it's early in the morning, there are only a few ghost-like figures on the road, where can I go to do business? If only I could be like those tough older brothers, with a spray gun in my hand, then I wouldn't be afraid of not making a profit; but I don't have that equipment, I can't even do the early morning rounds, let alone forceful robberies! I had no choice but to rub my stomach, tighten my belt, and gather my strength to rush forward. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of "Incoherent"</h3>
<p>— He Jiaqian</p>
<p>When people criticize articles, those of the type of Chinese language teachers mostly focus on "coherence" or "incoherence." However, writing Chinese well is actually very difficult to be "coherent." Even masters like Sima Qian, the Grand Historian, if you examine his articles carefully, no matter from the perspective of vocabulary, grammar, or rhetoric, you can find places that are "incoherent."</p>
<p>But I'm not talking about these now. What I want to say is that within the general term "incoherent," there are several kinds based on the reasons. Generally speaking, there are cases where the author's logic has not yet been cleared, and there are also cases where it could actually be coherent, but due to various relationships, the author does not dare to be coherent, or is unwilling to be coherent.</p>
<p>For example, the October 31st record in "×× Newspaper" about the "Jiangdu Tax Resistance Uprising," under the clever title of "Villagers Stir Up Trouble for the Second Time," the account of Chen Youliang's death states:</p>
<p>"Chen Youliang saw Liu Jinfa, who carried a pistol, among the official soldiers and police, and actually wanted to snatch Liu's pistol. He was shot and killed when a bullet was discharged from the chamber. The police also fired a volley of blank shots, and the villagers began to retreat."</p>
<p>The phrase "official" need not be added before "soldiers and police"—that's unnecessary. But I won't discuss that here. The strangest thing is that the bullet is written about as if it were a living thing, able to run out of the chamber on its own. But this makes the "also" in the following sentence incoherent. It would be more appropriate to change the previous sentence to "He was shot to death." If you want to preserve the previous sentence, then change the last two sentences to "The police also fired blank shots at the same time, and the villagers began to retreat." Only then would it be perfectly balanced, and have nothing to do with the soldiers and police, although the logic is still a bit strange.</p>
<p>Such strange articles often appear now. Actually, it's not that the authors are incapable of being coherent, but rather that they are afraid of not being allowed to be coherent, so they don't dare to be coherent from the start. The most intelligent people don't talk about these things, and become "art for art's sake" artists. The second most intelligent people use various methods to embellish this incoherence, and become "nationalist" writers. But both belong to the category of being "unwilling to be coherent."</p>
<h3>The Aims of the "International Women's Association"</h3>
<p>— Jian Feng</p>
<p>In the past, when people praised a woman, they would often say things like "beauty that can be eaten" or "enough to topple cities and states." The meaning of these adjectives, to put it plainly, is that women are merely objects for men to play with. In recent years, women have gradually awakened. They believe that in addition to their responsibilities in the family, women should also contribute to human society. Therefore, they are working to improve women's knowledge on the one hand, and engaging in the women's suffrage movement on the other. To unify the women's movement, they also have the organization of the International Women's Association. "Give me back my freedom, give me back my equality" is the cry of the association.</p>
<p>The International Woman Suffrage Alliance has been established for a long time, and last year marked the date of its twelfth congress. The association originally planned to hold the congress in Athens, the capital of Greece, in May last year, but because it was the height of the world economic panic, a large sum of money was needed to convene the congress, and the travel expenses for sending representatives from all over the world were also difficult to raise. After a meeting of the executive committee, it was decided to postpone the temporary congress to this spring in Marseille. Invitations have now been sent out to women's organizations from various countries that participate in the association, inviting them to send representatives to attend. It is said that Japan is also on the list of invitees.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this temporary congress is that in recent years, the world economy has fallen into a state of great panic, and the occupations, positions, etc. that women have gained through years of struggle have all been affected by it, and now most of them are being taken away by men again. In addition, countries such as Greece, France, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania, Switzerland, etc. still only recognize women's citizenship, but refuse to give them suffrage. In addition, countries in Asia and a large part of South America have not yet resolved the issue of women's suffrage. Even in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany, where women's suffrage has already been implemented, women are still subject to differential treatment under the law. All these things are considered extremely unfair by members of the International Women's Association. These are the issues that the association wants to discuss and resolve. In addition, the abolition of prostitution and the abolition of slave ownership and concubinage in African and Eastern countries will also be put forward for discussion at the congress.</p>
<p>The association strongly supports world peace. The members of the association all have great ideals, aiming to work with men to eliminate future wars and solve the world economic panic. The association once declared: "We are an organization that advocates that men and women should enjoy equal treatment in politics, economy, law, and morality. We will use political means and methods to achieve our goals. We do not want to see the cruel wars of mutual slaughter appear in the world again. We pray that human peace will last forever. The League of Nations is an international parliament, it is the messenger of maintaining world peace, and it is what our women have always supported. We hope that it can uphold justice and help us achieve our demands. We hope to work with men to realize the world's eternal peace and seek the revival of the world economy. This is our mission, and we are moving in this direction! ·····"</p>
<p>But world peace has already been completely destroyed by Japan, and the comedy stage of the League of Nations has been overturned by Japan with one foot. I wonder what kind of supernatural powers these "well-meaning" female bodhisattvas will have when they meet this spring to subdue the beastly Japanese?</p>
<h3>Welcoming the Lanterns</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Qi'er, squatting under the steps, was wearing a tattered, lined short jacket and a pair of gray open-crotch pants; his left hand was clutching a water chestnut that a vendor had dropped on the ground, but half of it had already gone into his stomach; his right hand was holding a stone, "drawing symbols" on the bluestone slab; two strings of yellow noodles-like snot hung from his nose, neatly hanging under his nostrils, waiting for him to start eating the remaining half of the water chestnut, and these "yellow noodles" would also go in with it.</p>
<p>He suddenly froze, his eyes staring unblinkingly at a hole in the wall. The scene of carrying lanterns during the Lantern Festival last night was playing out before his eyes.</p>
<p>"Hidden Dragon, Hidden Dragon, Hidden..." Some older children, holding a lion lantern filled with candlelight, rushed straight onto the street, banging gongs and drums.</p>
<p>"Tang tang..." Other children, who were a bit younger, banged on small gongs and drums, holding a white rabbit lantern, and rushed after the lion lantern.</p>
<p>"Heh! Heh! ... Heh!" This group was all seven- or eight-year-old children wearing dazzling clothes, each holding a bamboo pole, topped with rabbit, bird, or butterfly lanterns, shouting back and forth on the short street. Little Qi'er was first surprised and dazed, then his eyes turned red. He went to ask his mother with a hopeful heart. But in the end, he could only shed two lines of hot tears, and open his small mouth to "blow the trumpet."</p>
<p>Suddenly, he moved his gaze from the hole in the wall to the doorway of his house, quickly straightened his small legs, and used his hand to pull up the pants that were about to fall down; wiped the "yellow noodles" with his sleeve; his lips slightly parted and smiled; he quickly threw away the stone in his hand, took small steps, and ran home.</p>
<p>Not long after, he was holding a thin bamboo pole in his hand, with his father's old straw shoe, covered in mud, hanging high on the pole.</p>
<p>"Heh! Welcoming the lanterns! Heh! Welcoming the lanterns!" He looked up at the sky, looked at his "straw shoe lantern," grinned, and cheered non-stop; even though the mud and sand on the bottom of the straw shoe, like pepper, were falling into his small mouth, he didn't care.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts from Qu Lu</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhan</p>
<p>1. Sichuanese and Opium</p>
<p>A friend who had returned after retiring from Chengdu University said that Sichuan had a lot of opium, and the special tax was a major source of government revenue. He also said that local people who had some power always carried two guns with them, a long gun for killing others and a short gun for killing themselves. His words were full of sighs. I said, the people of Sichuan have been planting opium for at least a thousand years. The guest asked me what my basis was. I said, the late Tang Dynasty poet Yong Tao's poem "Westward Return to Xiegu" says: "Passing through the dangerous plank road and coming out of Bao Xie, I have gone through the plain and seem to have arrived home. Endless sorrow of travelers is scattered today, and the mianang flower is seen for the first time in front of the horse." Mianang flower is the poppy flower. Su Shi has a poem: "The Taoist advises to drink chicken su water, and the boy can decoct poppy soup." Su Zhe also has a poem about planting medicinal seedlings, singing about the poppy. It can be seen that people in the Tang and Song Dynasties regarded opium as a precious medicine for treating diseases. Yong Tao and Su were both from Shu (Sichuan), so it can be seen that the people of Sichuan had a relationship with opium as early as the Tang and Song Dynasties.</p>
<p>2. Lotus Drop Poet</p>
<p>My friend Zhigang Liwu loves to listen to Lotus Drop the most. Liwu can also snap his fingers and compose poems on the spot, like singing Lotus Drop, which his friends use as a joke.</p>
<p>For the past five or six years, we have all made a living by running around, drifting in all directions, and the Lotus Drop of Changsha is no longer heard. After the September 18th Incident, I saw the Tan Hui of the Bubu Ting Cao Zhai published in Shen Bao, which often contained vernacular poems lamenting current events, which had the rhyme of Lotus Drop. I also secretly took the verses of the Tang Dynasty poet Zhang Hu, "Casually collect words and phrases, boast to the people and call them begging," and wrote dozens of poems such as "National Affairs Yin" to express my sorrow and anger. Composing wildly according to events is no different from the meaning of Lotus Drop, but I have never used it to beg for money to exchange for rice. I don't know when Lotus Drop started. In Yuan zaju and Ming legends, beggars are seen singing Lotus Drop. Wu Deng Hui Yuan recorded that Yu Daopo followed the crowd to visit Langya. One day, he heard a beggar singing Lotus Drop and had a great enlightenment. It seems that Lotus Drop already existed in the Song Dynasty. Also, Quan Tang Shi quoted Hou Qinglu: "There was a zheshan (folded shirt) zuizi in the Tang Dynasty, who danced and sang, 'Holding the board and singing wildly to beg for money, drifting in the river and following fate, straight until old, always like this, better than playing power in dangerous times.'" Could this be the earliest Lotus Drop poet?</p>

<h3>Divergent Paths of Love and the Times (Draft)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Maiping</p>
<p>Thinking this, he could no longer restrain himself. He strode straight into Mrs. Tsuruko's room.</p>
<p>"You're bullying Mr. Zeng while he's not home!"</p>
<p>In his excitement, he was still able to consider this justification, and declare war on that Japanese fellow. That Japanese fellow was just about to get up and give him a morning greeting, but unexpectedly, he got a slap on the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>"Aha! Aha!"</p>
<p>Haiquan shouted, and the second slap flew over. This time, the slap really angered the Japanese fellow. He retreated to the edge of the futon and took off his Chinese robe, threw it on the ground, and began to rub his fists and wipe his palms, preparing for "Sumo."</p>
<p>"Terrible!..."</p>
<p>Haiquan heard a sharp voice like a pen tip coming from behind. At the moment of difficulty, he thought of retreating, fearing being looked down upon by the Japanese fellow; not retreating, and fighting the Japanese fellow, no matter who won or lost, he would definitely suffer. He was afraid that he would be locked up in the police station for a few days! A few days would be okay, but what if he was sentenced to a fairly long prison term? Because the laws in the concession protected the imperialists from trampling on Chinese civilians!</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, he's my father!"</p>
<p>He was embraced by her, and at the same time, he smelled an intoxicating fragrance. While he was thinking about what attitude to take to deal with the current predicament, he was desperately appreciating the fragrance emanating from her.</p>
<p>She spoke to the Japanese fellow again in Japanese. He had not yet understood what attitude the Japanese fellow was expressing, and he had already been dragged and half-hugged by Mrs. Tsuruko with all her might, and pulled out of the room.</p>
<p>His face was pale, and he couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier that he's my father... Go back to your room, for my sake."</p>

<h3>Raking Up Old News</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>A few years ago, because of a moment of "righteous indignation," I spoke up for the students and school authorities of Peking University, under the title "Peking Universities Get the Cold Shoulder." Unexpectedly, it caused Mr. "Xiao" to raise the issue of the southward transport of antiquities. Later, Mr. He Jiaqian of Ziyou Tan gave a summary, saying in essence: The southward transport of antiquities is for the sake of selling them for money. If university students could also be sold at a high price, then they would also be transported south in armored cars.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the "backbone elements" of the country are far inferior to antique archives. The reason is clear. However, judging from the newspapers, it is inevitable to make us suspicious, because the authorities' good intentions are only to "decide to move south," and there is no mention of selling them. Moreover, they will be sent back to Peking in the future, but no date has been set. So our speculation is not as accurate as the resolution.</p>
<p>Whether archive antiques can be sold for money, I think everyone can understand. Since they can be sold for money, and they are also objects from the Forbidden City, their value is inestimable, of course, it is conceivable. If anyone can seize them for private ownership, of course, they can become rich to an unbounded extent, needless to say. Even if they are offered as tribute to the dynasty, the official position should not be lower than the first rank. Fortunately, there is a Shanghai that will last for all time in China, otherwise, what if they are looted by the "Huns"? Even if the area north of the Yellow River is all the land of barbarians, and the area of the Yangtze River basin with its spiritual mountains and rivers is designated as the capital of the Republic of China, our cultural and spiritual antique archives can still be transported by armored plane to the Pamir Plateau. When ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers all hear the cries of ghosts in the coming years, we will have so many treasures of the holy dynasty, so in our spirit, we will still not lose our status as a "land of culture and relics." As for whether we can fortunately send them back to the Forbidden City, let's wait and see. In case of unfortunate premature death, we can also write a note in our will, instructing our children and grandchildren to take a trip to the old capital.</p>
<p>Secondly, university students have no fixed price in the market. Mr. He is indeed saying the truth. What we hear about the trafficking of people is nothing more than children and women, and university students are not counted among them. However, we have also heard the story of Lincoln freeing the slaves, so it can be seen that after black people were conquered by white people, they were bought and sold by white people in the market. However, there may not be any university students among the black slaves, but at that time, will university students shed their original form as Chinese people? Because if this "long-term" continues, it is not completely without hope that China will be sold off piecemeal.</p>

<h3>Another Hair Dyeing Method</h3>
<p>— White-Haired Youth</p>
<p>Previously, I saw the hair dyeing method introduced by Mr. Shen Erming in this magazine. The author is now thirty years old, and his hair is full of white hair, so he made it according to the method, but the result was not very satisfactory. Moreover, because it is toxic, I dare not try it more. Now the author has made a kind of hair dye himself, and the result is quite good. The manufacturing method is convenient, and there is no danger of toxicity. I dare not keep it a secret, so I introduce it below:</p>
<p>The hair dye is divided into two types, A and B, which are used in sequence. The manufacturing method is as follows:</p>
<p>Type A: Dissolve ten grams of silver nitrate in one hundred grams of distilled water to obtain it. However, ordinary water cannot be used, because ordinary water contains green compounds, which easily combine with silver nitrate to form a white precipitate, thus reducing its effect.</p>
<p>Type B: Dissolve 4.6 grams of sodium sulfide in one hundred grams of water to obtain it. Although this substance does not necessarily require distilled water like Type A, it should not come into contact with metal.</p>
<p>The above two types of liquid medicine must be stored in dark-colored (blue or brown-yellow) glass bottles, because white bottles, when directly exposed to sunlight, will change their quality.</p>
<p>When using, first wash your hair clean, and after drying it, use a small brush to dip Type A hair dye and brush it all over your white hair. Wait until it is dry (about five minutes) and then use another small brush to dip Type B hair dye and apply it. Because the two types of liquid medicine undergo a chemical change, forming black silver sulfide, which can adhere to the hair. To avoid affecting the skin of the face and neck, which may also be stained with black spots, you can apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or other oils in advance. Wash with tooth powder and soap.</p>
<h3>Liquid Hair Conditioner</h3>
<p>Hair often becomes dry due to insufficient fat. Because the hair itself normally secretes an appropriate amount of oil, if the fat decreases due to pathological phenomena, it will inevitably become yellow, withered, and dry, and even fall out. Usually, washing hair is to clean it, but you also need to often apply oil-based products to replenish the lack of oil. Solid hair creams, such as Stanco, have already been disclosed in this magazine. Now I will introduce a liquid hair conditioner:</p>
<p>Raw materials: 35 grams of castor oil, 250 grams of almond (extracted) oil, 110 grams of glycerin, 13 grams of fragrance, appropriate amount of alcohol.</p>
<p>Manufacturing method: Place castor oil in a large cup and mix it with almond oil. At the same time, dissolve glycerin and fragrance in 500 grams of alcohol. Mix these two things together, stir evenly, and then add an appropriate amount of alcohol to make one kilogram of hair conditioner.</p>
<h3>Non-greasy Hair Conditioner</h3>
<p>To make hair shiny, people often use hair oils and creams such as Stanco, but oil can accumulate dirt, especially for those who often travel to and from the city, dust accumulates in the hair, which is not hygienic. Now I will list the manufacturing method of non-greasy hair conditioner:</p>
<p>Raw materials: 10 grams of tragacanth gum, 10 grams of glycerin, 20 grams of alcohol, 20 grams of rose oil, 240 grams of hot water.</p>
<p>Manufacturing method: First dissolve rose oil (or use other fragrances) and glycerin in alcohol, mix well, then place in a mortar, mix with gum, finally add hot water, stir constantly until cool, and you will get a smooth and clean hair conditioner.</p>
<h3>The Illusion of a Dream</h3>
<p>— Shen Bin</p>
<p>The sky was suddenly covered in a grey haze, the thermometer's mercury plummeted below thirty degrees, and dust, like smoke, rose from the northwest corner, gradually approaching, making a "whoosh! whoosh!" sound! Ah! The wind is coming! And it's carrying snowflakes!</p>
<p>I trembled in a small, low thatched hut. My wife seemed to be beside me, and we both shrank our necks, looking outside, white breath puffing from our mouths. The wind grew stronger and stronger, and the snow fell heavier and heavier. Instantly, the grey universe transformed into a silver-white world!</p>
<p>"Are you cold?" I asked my wife.</p>
<p>"How can I not be cold? But what can we do?"</p>
<p>We couldn't bear the bitter cold any longer. My wife gathered some wood scraps from the corner and placed them in a broken pot. I struck a match and lit the wood scraps. Suddenly, all the wood scraps blazed up, and my wife and I both laughed!</p>
<p>We sat facing each other, feeling a little warmer all over!</p>
<p>"Old Li!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, this voice came from afar, and we both watched where it came from.</p>
<p>"Ah! Xiao Er? How are you still alive? Didn't I see in the newspaper the other day that you were killed by the enemy at Yuguan?"</p>
<p>This was a surprising and unexpected thing. How could Xiao Er, who had been killed by Japanese soldiers a year ago, be here now? We only saw him wearing a tattered military uniform, and amidst the snowflakes covering him, we could faintly see patches of blood! He walked from afar, finally reaching our small thatched hut, and we invited him to sit by our brazier.</p>
<p>"Old Li! I didn't die! I didn't die?"</p>
<p>"Ah! You didn't die? Then why did the newspaper the other day report your death?" my wife said.</p>
<p>"I don't care about that. I didn't know anything about it. I won't die. I will live forever!"</p>
<p>"Good! Then I'll bless the nation that we still have our strong soldiers! Xiao Er, may you kill many more enemy heads!"</p>
<p>After I said that, we all laughed!</p>
<p>"Old Li! Let's not waste time with small talk. I have news for you."</p>
<p>"What…?"</p>
<p>"Shanhaiguan has fallen. There are more and more Japanese soldiers. They are now preparing for a general offensive against our Rehe. I'm here to tell you! Our government, which has been clinging to a policy of non-resistance, is now officially resisting. Tens of thousands of northern brothers and many munitions were transported from the central government to our Northeast yesterday. How happy we are! I didn't die, I won't die! Ah! Old Li! Isn't this a great time? Let's all go! The government is resisting. Let's all go and kill our enemies! We must recover lost territory and trample the three islands...</p>
<p>..."</p>
<p>He said excitedly, but my wife suddenly interrupted him!</p>
<p>"Really? Is the government no longer relying on the League of Nations?"</p>
<p>"What's the use of the League of Nations? It's just an organization for the powerful countries to divide the spoils. Now our government has finally realized that!"</p>

<p>Non-Resistance Policy</p>

<p>"Good, then let's go!" we all shouted.</p>
<p>"Hey! Juan! You're a woman, you can't go!" Xiao Er said to my wife.</p>
<p>"Can't women defend the country?"</p>
<p>"Alright! Then you can be a medic!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Listen! Listen!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Isn't that the sound of a bugle?"</p>
<p>"Let's go! Hurry! Get weapons! Hurry!"</p>
<p>At that moment, we were walking in the heavy snow, running desperately. Suddenly, "Bang! Bang!" a few shots rang out! My wife suddenly fell to the ground in front of me!</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah!"</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>I finally cried out loud, my eyes opened, and I was still sleeping alone in bed. The sun was shining on my window, and the Wang family across the street were setting off firecrackers with "bang! bang!..." Ah! Isn't today the Lunar New Year? Then I realized the illusion of the dream I had just had! I jumped out of bed in one go!</p>
<h3>Chinese Smart, Foreigners Smart</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Office workers who use the tram often hear the phrase "help a little" to freeload. Speaking of freeloading from foreigners, we might as well "help a little," benefiting others without hurting ourselves. Why not do this kind of smart thing?</p>
<p>But in the end, foreigners are smart, and this topic is discussed over tea and after meals. The reason is that the buses are equipped with many machines that only allow things to go in, not out. You buy a ticket with a lead coin. When you want to get off, you have to insert the lead coin into the machine. The ticket seller shouts, "No way out," and the passenger says, "Inconvenient." But you can't freeload with a copper coin. "Foreigners are really smart!"</p>
<p>The bus arrives at a stop, and the ticket seller, with a pitiful look, says to each departing passenger, "Help a little."</p>
<p>To get off, you have to insert the lead coin. Would the bus stop on a busy city street and have you jump out the window? But you don't know that the Chinese are also smart. They can pull the imported door, and while it's half open, a "helpful" friend, in a quick moment, sneaks out without paying.</p>
<p>"Help a little," the "helpful" friend says again to the second person freeloading from the foreigner.</p>
<p>To prevent the Chinese from freeloading, foreigners invented a machine that only allows things to go in, not out. Foreigners installed machines that only allow things to go in, not out, but the Chinese still freeload. Foreigners smart, Chinese smart?</p>
<p>Shop Clerk Communication</p>
<h3>Brother and Sister</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a lonely, weak woman. When I was nine years old, Heaven took away my loving parents, leaving only my brother and me. Because there was no inheritance, I lived in my paternal uncle's house, while my brother went out to learn a trade. Now we have both grown up, and logically, my brother and I should be harmonious! But because we have different mothers, he treats me very coldly. In these few years, although we have exchanged letters, they have only been superficial pleasantries. Recently, it's been even worse. I've written to him several times, but he hasn't replied; I've visited him several times, but he avoids me; recently, it's said that he's been transferred to Nanjing for work, and he doesn't even bother to let me know his mailing address. The day before yesterday, I met his friend and learned that he has even declared that he doesn't recognize me as his sister! Judging by his recent attitude, this is certainly true. For the sake of a proper future, I want to formally sever my brother-sister relationship with him. I don't know if this is possible; whether I need to get his consent before publishing a declaration in the newspaper; or whether a one-sided declaration is valid.</p>
<p>I am currently working as a temporary clerk in my uncle's shop, and it seems that there is no future. I want to enter the film industry; I don't know if this is a suitable career for me.</p>
<p>I am really uncertain about the above two questions, so I am writing this letter specifically to ask you for advice, which I eagerly look forward to. I wish you</p>
<p>Good health, Wu Yu Ying</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Editor's note: The brother and sister of Ms. Wu, because of their shared hardships, should logically cherish each other and be especially harmonious. Unfortunately, her brother has the four words "different mothers" stuck in his chest, leading to discord and treating each other as strangers, which is indeed very painful. But we believe that Ms. Wu also has no reason to formally declare a severance of the brother-sister relationship. You should know that, legally, adult siblings have no restrictions on each other. Moreover, in fact, because there is no inheritance, there will be no disputes. Therefore, the continued existence of the brother-sister relationship will not cause any problems in the future, and can even be left as a chance for reconciliation in the future.</p>
<p>There are many careers suitable for women, and film is certainly one of them. However, this requires "talent" and "interest." Now many people are loudly shouting to overthrow "talent" in many things, which is certainly correct; but we still believe that in the arts, "talent" is indispensable. Imitating others will never be pleasing. As for interest, Ms. Wu should consider it deeply. You can't just look at the external glory of ordinary stars, but you must see the difficulties of their success. We dare not be dogmatic about Ms. Wu's talent and interest; in short, film is indeed a career suitable for women, as long as you have this talent and this interest.</p>
<p>Finally, we still have a question. Has Ms. Wu previously told her brother about her ambition to "enter the film industry"? If so, we also suspect that your brother's recent attitude may have something to do with this. But this is just his stubbornness, and Ms. Wu can ignore it. We hope that you will enter the film industry for the sake of art, we hope that you will succeed, and we hope that you will give your stubborn brother no excuse, and that he will be speechless.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>I have repeatedly seen in your newspaper that several readers want Mr. Lüshuang to answer questions about artificial ivory, but Mr. Lüshuang has not yet replied. I dare not boast myself, but recently I read in an old book about three methods of making artificial ivory, so I have recorded them for readers who want to try them. Furthermore, for those methods that fail or are ineffective, the responsibility lies with the author or the person doing the experiment. Shi Zhirang</p>
<p>Artificial Ivory (1) Seven taels of fine eggshell powder, three taels of fine plaster powder, and white and pure fish glue dissolved in water as appropriate. First, mix the eggshell powder and plaster powder thoroughly, pour in the glue water, and grind. Coat the inside of the wooden mold (which can be any shape) with lard, and put the previously prepared material into the mold. Let it stand for seven days and take it out to dry in the shade. It will be no different from real ivory.</p>
<p>(2) Pour ten taels of clear water and mix with eight qian of sulfuric acid to make dilute sulfuric acid. Then, put in five taels of peeled potatoes (i.e., Chinese yam beans, which taste like moss and are small in shape, often used in Western dishes) and soak for sixty hours. Then, filter through a bucket and squeeze dry the remaining material. Use strong force to make a solid body, and wait until it is completely dry to become the hardest ivory, which can be carved into objects at will.</p>
<p>(3) One tael each of fish glue, brandy, and fine eggshell powder, mix together, and add a little heat to make a mud-like substance. Stir thoroughly and put it into the mold. After it cools, it becomes solid ivory.</p>

<p>Ah Li kept calling Ruo Hua "Madam," which annoyed Ruo Hua. In front of Ah Li, she beat Mao Sheng again, which was clearly "striking his body, shaming my face." How could Ah Li put up with it? She relied on the fact that Madam had recognized her as a daughter and, with the status of a young lady, was able to compete with the concubine. She argued with Ruo Hua, and neither would give in. In the end, Dai Qiu came out and persuaded Ah Li to leave.</p>
<p>Ruo Hua thought that Ah Li was a sent-off maidservant and shouldn't be so presumptuous, so she ordered Lao Hu to notify Sang Aqiang and give him one month to return the house, and forbid him from opening a tailor shop in the room between the walls. Who knew that Sang Aqiang's attitude was very tough? He took out a lease, saying that the Xia family had signed a twenty-year lease agreement with him. If the landlord wanted to take back the house, he would have to compensate him for twenty years of business losses, limited to at least three hundred yuan per month. This amount of loss would not be enough to compensate him even if the landlord's property was sold.</p>
<p>Ruo Hua listened to Lao Hu's reply and discussed it with Youzhong, but they couldn't do anything about Sang Aqiang. They could only scold the deceased Madam and admonish Mao Sheng not to cause trouble at the tailor shop in the future.</p>
<p>(9) Brothers are like limbs, wives are like clothes</p>
<p>Xia Zhongnan fell, and lawsuits accusing him came flying like snowflakes. Most of the lawsuits said that his concubine Ai Ruo Hua had taken bribes and sold positions. This was all that Madam had done behind the Master's back, and the person who handled it was Fifth Master Xia Youzhong. After the case was exposed, Zhongnan was still confused. No wonder Youzhong fled overnight with his sister-in-law as soon as he heard the news of Zhongnan's detention. It turned out that they were the main culprits in bribery and corruption.</p>
<p>Money that goes into the pockets of officials is like Jiang Ziya selling ashes—a gust of wind blows it all away. To get the original thing back is like "dried fish hanging on the tip of your nose"—don't even think about it! Xia Zhongnan was imprisoned for more than a year. He could only risk his old life, but he couldn't squeeze any money out of him. Everyone knew that his ill-gotten gains had long been taken back by his brother and wife, but his hometown was located in a place that the political power of the Tiannan government could not reach, so there was no way to confiscate his family property to compensate. What good would it do to force him to death?</p>
<p>Zhongnan was kept in a damp and filthy detention room for a year and a half and gradually developed hemiplegia. He was transferred to a hospital, where he stayed for a few months. The superiors saw that they really couldn't squeeze any oil out of the stone and that someone had come to intercede for him, so they were happy to do a favor and released him.</p>
<p>After regaining his freedom, he immediately telegraphed home to tell his wife to come to the dock to meet him. He set off northward by boat that night. When the boat arrived at his hometown, Ruo Hua brought her daughter and brother Youzhong to welcome him. They saw that his face was swollen, his hair was white, his appearance was very haggard, and he couldn't move half of his body. He had become a fresh, living dead man. Youzhong brought a strong servant named Ah Hai, who carried the Second Master ashore, put him in a car, and then brought him back.</p>
<p>After Zhongnan returned home, his two old brothers, Bodong and Jibei, came to visit him once. Youzhong accompanied him every day, chatting and laughing. However, Ruo Hua treated him very coldly. On the other hand, Dai Qiu served him very diligently. Ruo Hua always said bad things about her son Mao Sheng in front of him, because she said such bad things about the child, it aroused Zhongnan's suspicion. He thought that although Mao Sheng was not promising, he was not necessarily so bad, and that she must be treating her son with the heart of a stepmother. Therefore, he began to look at Mao Sheng in a different light. Because he was protecting the child's petty details, the old couple often had arguments.</p>
<p>Ruo Hua often dressed up in gorgeous clothes and went out to play and socialize. Zhongnan lay in his chair and watched, feeling really angry. He had advised her many times, but she just wouldn't listen. One day, she changed into bright clothes and walked past him with coquettish gestures. He called out to her and asked softly: (To be continued)</p>
