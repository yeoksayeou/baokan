<p>時評</p>
<h3>日美兩國海空軍之競賽實　－軍縮會議失敗後之太平洋形勢－</h3>
<p>日美關係。近以英日經濟對立激化。與日蘇外交緊張。而形成緩和之勢。此種緩和。就日本之解釋。則以爲日美兩國。經濟上殊少積極衝突性能。而多調和餘地。因棉花與生絲之交換。爲歷史的淵源。而世界經濟恐慌之深刻。反使此類相需更爲切要。至於美國方面。則忙於鎭定國内之經濟恐慌。亟圖以和平方法。開闢海外市塲。對日本之軍事冐險行動。不能不暫守緘默。然前所謂日美間之利益。果可調和。政治關係惡化亦不嚴重耶。此則無論何人皆知其不然。蓋顯然爲日人之外交作用。欲借以穩定其楚歌四面之人心。冀減少其國際間應付之障碍耳。</p>
<p>元來日本之突起於太平洋也。借助於英國特多。在日俄戰爭之前。帝俄勢力膨脹。一面欲伸手於太平洋。以囊括中國。制覇海上。一面由中亞細亞越過回回民族而窺伺印度。英吉利爲保持其東方市場計。爲印度統治之安全計必須制止帝俄勢力之過度伸展。遂亦不得不扶助日本而壓抑俄國。但自俄國大革命後。其國家之根本國策。即已變更。英國對之雖不能無所戒備然以日本之突飛猛進。較從前之俄羅斯尤甚。其經濟力之擴展與海上實力之膨脹。足令英國在逺東市場深感不安。是以英國不得不先圖其藩籬之鞏固使香港以西爲其海上之勢力範圍。而逺東市場乃爲其先驅。印度則爲其本據。對日貨之輸往印度。須受一定之制限。由是日英間之關係。由同盟而分離。</p>
<p>而成爲敵國矣。</p>
<p>日蘇兩國在歷史上旣多裂痕。在理論立塲上亦絶不相容。然於國際關係尚不致無轉旋餘地。惟是日本挑動九一八事變以後。對蘇關係。趨惡化。蘇聯在北滿旣得權益之被侵奪固不僅中東路一綫而已。海參崴有被侵之虞貝加爾亦不免側背受制。同時日本又爲亞東之大陸軍國。傳統之假想敵。即爲蘇聯。兩國間由政治經濟立塲之不同。而演成軍事上之嚴重戒備。一遇機會。即有爆炸之可能。</p>
<p>在此危機顯露之秋。日美關係。僅屬一部分輿論之轉變。而美蘇兩國則加速恢復國交。雖復交内容側重於經濟。然政治上亦將有巨大影響。尤於逺東之現局。具有特殊之關聯。是以日本迭次變更其第二次補充海軍建艦計劃於建造航空母艦二艘巡洋艦二艘及驅逐艦潛水艇等倫敦條約限制以内。應造艦艇計二十三艘。其他尚有運輸艦及修理艦等在限制外者。計有二十六艘。航空部隊亦陡增八隊。其海軍建艦預算。雖巳減低至於四億五千萬日金。但仍保留將來預算之追加。如此大規模之增築戰艦。能不令美國警懼英國戒備乎。</p>
<p>美國在逺逺東前進的軍事根據。一爲關島馬尼刺。而美國太平洋岸之海軍本據。距夏威夷珍珠港在二千海里以上。珍珠港距關島在三千三百海里以上。馬尼刺與關島之間。亦一千五百餘海里。即亞留仙羣島與布列門登－西亞圖附近之軍港－取得聯絡。亦甚不易。而日本之前進根據。界於台灣海峽間之澎湖島。距馬尼刺不過六百里。距日本本國亦不過一千五百餘海里。則日本之防守。固甚容易。即進取關島。窺伺菲利濱。亦不十分困難。况由琉球至關島海程。不過八百五十海里。日本太平洋上之海軍前進根據地－小笠原島。距横須賀不過五百五十海里。其運用靈活。行動敏捷。逺非美國所可得而企及。頃又努力於擴張海上空軍。軍全力。雖不如美國。但防守有餘即進窺美之屬地。亦非難事。再加以航空隊運動之快速。爆炸力之猛烈。美國防禦菲島之能力。究竟難期穩。固對於開發逺東市塲。更感受莫大之威脅則日美海軍空軍之競賽。將成爲今後太平洋之汹濤巨浪。不至激成最後戰爭不止也。</p>
<h3>羅馬談話結束俄外長發表宣言　重申維持和平志願　斥軍縮會僅存屍骸　對逺東討論守緘默　改造國聯未曾議及　宗教政策初未改變　李維諾夫昨晚離意京赴柏林　否認俄德有成立不侵約可能</h3>
<p>羅馬　今日蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫向報界發表長篇聲明、力言俄國維持四鄰和平之志願、並謂意俄兩國在過去十年間、未嘗有討論友誼關係如今日者、至美國之承認蘇俄、未曾改變向來意俄間之關係、今日下午李維諾夫赴美大使郎氏歡送宴、由美大使署與俄大使署要員相陪、傍晚李氏赴土耳其大使之餞别宴、今晚九時三十分蘇俄外交委員即將啓程赴柏林、與美國第一任駐俄大使布立特相晤於彼間、（五日國民電）</p>

<h3>注重增進德俄關係</h3>
<p>羅馬　今晚　首相屬索里尼將出席俄大使署之宴會、届時雙方將繼續談判、現盛傳俄外長曾晤見德大使、此說尚難證明、假定果有其事、則其晤面亦必異常秘密、（四日路透電）</p>

<h3>意國反對德奥聯合</h3>
<p>維也納　報紙對西班牙選舉事件、及李維諾夫遊歷羅馬事、記載頗多、羅馬方面傳來消息、謂意大利當局曾宣言意國對於德奥聯合一層、無論如何必加反對、奥京各報對此消息、並不加以批評、因意大利維持奥大利政治獨立之决心、巳爲舉世所知、無庸多贅也、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄副外委歡宴德使</h3>

<h3>各方印象矛直互見</h3>
<p>羅馬　報界評論李維諾夫與墨索里尼會談後發表之公報、謂談話詳細情形雖不得而知、然兩人會晤、似曾論及軍縮·多瑙河問題·及逺東問題、擬於國聯會以外、用其他列强所均可承認之方法考慮之、公報中有一語爲各報所注重即「李墨兩人認爲可按照意大利與蘇俄所訂友好條約之精神、以改善一般政局」「論壇報」謂在國聯以外有若干主要問題須待解决、例如蘇俄與德國及日本之關係、與日内瓦不相干涉、因三國均非國聯會會員故也、「意大利日報」謂現有各種問題、與一切國家相關、其範圍軼出歡洲領土以外者、自蘇俄外委與意相會晤之後、國際關係得以澄清、而此種與大局相關之問題、自較易於解决云、要之各報對於意俄兩國代表談話所作評論、不甚明切、且有互相矛盾之處、綜此以觀、則意俄兩國代表對於國際政局、不過作一通常之討論、未見有何具體决定、即兩國外交方針、亦未必有何變更、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>意名記者主張改善俄意商務關係</h3>
<p>羅馬　意國名記者安格萊、今日在報章發表論文、主張俄方將運入意境之木料自動减少、俾使意國可向奥國購買木料、藉以增進意奥兩國間之經濟關係、今年前八個月中意國運俄之貨物、值一千一百萬盧布、但意國進口之俄貨、則值一千五百萬盧布、故意國亟願將入超之貿易加以糾正、安格萊又以爲意俄兩國締結友誼與在不侵犯恊定、或將開歐陸政策之新紀元、因如此則各國間均可由同樣的雙方條約互相連繫、以代替國聯會之多方的恊定云、（四日路透電）</p>

<h3>主席報告</h3>
<p>行禮如儀後、由主席黄造雄報告、略謂、今天是肇和軍艦舉義紀念日、這紀念的意義、這紀念的經過情形、在宣傳大綱中有詳盡說明不必贅述、在此紀念中、有值得我們注意的有兩點、（一）是這紀念可以說是再造民國的紀念日、中國自辛亥革命後、一般人以爲革命已經成功、故革命思想日就衰落、革命黨人日趨腐化、袁逆世凱、遂乘機把持政權、勢力澎漲到南方、壓迫黨人、自謀帝制、總理睹此現象、就積極另謀總付、那時陳英士先烈奉命在滬工作、遂有肇和舉義的事件發生、此舉對本黨歷史、最有價值、這是第一點、（二）是革命紀念日很多、此紀念日是更值得紀念、當時袁黨滿佈各地、先烈王曉峰·王明山·二同志自刺鄭汝成於白渡橋後、慷慨自首、從容就義、此種殺身成仁的行爲、在目前實屬少見云云、</p>
<h3>代表演說</h3>
<p>主席報告畢、由和安小學校長許書紳演說、略謂、肇和軍艦舉義紀念的意義、是要剷除本黨本命的暗礁、孫總理領導本黨、如以前無暗礁、决不致至辛亥才革命成功、自辛亥革命初步成功後、國人認爲即能大放光明、豈料又遇重大暗礁、即是袁逆醖釀帝制、那時袁逆陽奉黨命、隂謀專制、時陳英士先生等即在滬舉義、無如其時國人、腦筋陳腐、麻木不仁、故肇和軍艦、仍不能成功、其原因在缺乏宣傳、自肇和舉義的影響後來遂把袁逆帝夢驚破、但暗礁何多、如張勳復辟、軍閥鬥爭、民無寗日、至今亦不能盡凈、目前最大的暗礁、内受共匪的騷擾、外被帝國主養的壓迫、致革命事業、處處阻碍、建設事件、不能順利進行、受此種種障碍、莫不因國人步驟不一、主張不同、各自爲戰、致成目前之局函、在今天舉行肇和紀念、我們應從此統一各個人的心理、充實我們同胞同志的力量思想、來努力復興建立新民國云云、</p>
<h3>標語口號</h3>
<p>（一）肇和舉義、是擁護民國推倒帝制的革命壯舉、（二）肇和起義、是民國復興的重大關鍵、（三）肇和起義、是雲兩起義成功的先聲、（四）紀念肇和起義、要凖備實力收復東北四省、（五）繼承肇和舉義先烈的精神、抗禦舉日、（六）恊助中央、肅清赤匪、（七）努力經濟建設、充守國力、（八）精誠團結、擁護中央、</p>
<h3>海員黨部</h3>
<p>中華海員特别黨部、昨晨九時、在該黨部大禮堂、舉行肇和軍盤發難紀念大會、全體委員職員曁上海區黨部區分部各海員團體代表百餘人出席、行禮如儀、主席馬委員伯麟報告肇和發艱始末、略謂、民國四年秋、袁逆世凱隂圖帝制、爪牙佈滿全國、淞滬護軍使鄭汝成、即其一也、陳英士先生受總理命、與蔣中正同志主持上海革命事務、於十二月五日、命楊嘯天先生率領海軍陸戰隊廿餘人、乘僱定小輪、往佔肇和軍艦、嚴禁該艦官兵於艙内、斧劈彈藥庫、取出彈藥、發砲攻製造局、轟擊六十餘發、陸上未有響應、正疑慮間、應瑞通濟兩逆艦、巳受袁軍重賄、反攻肇和、計發數砲俱命中、傷肇和士兵多名、而陸上袁軍密佈、斷絶交通、伯麟與廿餘同志、隨楊嘯天先生、沉着應戰、至更深時、陸上旣無應援、而逆艦仍不斷進攻、同時肇和起錨機復被逆砲炸壞、無法起錨開艦、不得巳暫行上陸、伯麟與楊嘯天先生、冒諸艱辛、於次日先後返法租界總機關、晋謁陳英士先生、請示再舉、迨二次舉義、伯麟奉命赴虎門、爲李福林截獲、解往廣州龍濟光處、扣押五十餘日、適逢雲南舉義、始復自由、時楊嘯天先生、爲海軍司令、伯麟爲海軍陸戰隊總指揮、此次舉義、煞費苦心、事雖不成、然已寒袁賊之胆、以故雲南起義、袁遂憂鬱以死、是爲吾黨打倒舊軍閥一大紀念云云、十一時振鈴散會、</p>
<h3>海員工會</h3>
<p>昨日爲肇和軍艦起義十八週紀念日、中華海員工會籌委員、爲紀念起見、特於上午十時、舉行儀式、到全體職員曁上海各海員團體代表共百餘人、事前本定該會常委楊虎、親蒞報告當時發難經過、及現在感想、但因事臨時推由秘書后大椿代表主席、報告經過、旋由孫秘書履平及各代表相繼演說、情緒頗爲熱烈、極一時之盛云</p>
<h3>肇和學校</h3>
<p>紀念肇和舉義而設之海格路肇和中學、昨日清晨八時、在該校大禮堂、舉行紀念大會、到全體師生及學生家長來賓等三百餘人、場内外滿貼標語、並懸半旗、空氣非常嚴肅、首由主席賈校長報告肇和兵艦舉義詳情、繼請熟悉肇和舉義之鄭西平氏演說、語甚警惕、並含勗勉之意、肇即散會、</p>
<h3>交部通令各輪公司禁止滬閩通航　外輪進出亦受檢查</h3>
<p>自閩變發生後、交通部爲防止奸人私運軍火接濟閩方起見、特通令上海航政局、轉飭各商輪公司、滬閩班一律暫行停駛、如須經過福州、亦不准停靠、該局奉令後、即行轉飭各輪公司知照、除國營招商局在未奉令前巳停駛外、餘如三北常安兩公司之滬閩班奉令後、即巳停駛、改途航行、至外輪如怡和公司等、仍照常行駛、惟經過海口時、須愛海軍之檢查、</p>
<h3>從航業界傳來閩變後之現狀　閩海口無形封鎖　市面上安定如恒</h3>
<p>閩省事變發生以來、滬上盛傳浙閩邊境、形勢緊張、昨日本埠接閩省發來電訊、謂福州方面、形勢巳漸緩和、惟外輪進出、已實施檢查、亟將閩中眞象、分述如下、</p>
<h3>海軍檢查外輪</h3>
<p>福州變起、中央即派海軍第一艦隊開往三多澳、準備封鎖閩海、斷絶閩方接濟、惟因洋商輪照常行駛、海軍當局殊無法將閩港阻斷、現在形勢緊張、自本月二日起、自難再待、故在三多澳軍艦、巳派至福州港口、實施檢查往來閩港各商船、惟國輪業巳停航、目下往來者、祇有英日外輪、日前怡和洋行恒生輪、由港到閩、當進閩港時、由逸仙軍艦命令停泊、派官兵登輪、對船内乘客詳加盤詰、行李一併檢視、貨艙内亦開視、該輪由福州開出時、亦如之、是以福州海面交通、不啻無形封鎖矣、</p>
<h3>洋商要求免查</h3>
<p>恒生輪此次開回上海、輪主向滬行報告、該行以現有正班福州輪捷升、亦須行駛、以海軍此次檢查、並不需要、聞巳呈請英國駐華使領、向我國政府請求免檢、以免引起糾紛、</p>
<h3>厦門行輪如常</h3>
<p>厦門亦爲閩省重要海港、自經蔣委員長、電令國輪、勿再在閩省沿海口岸停泊後、華商輪船已停航、該埠外輪則仍照常開行、昨日荷輪芝巴達由厦來滬、據該輪中人言、船舶至厦、閩當局因鑒於厦門一埠外僑甚多、尤其爲台灣籍民、深恐引起糾紛、故對外國輪進出、仍照常不予檢查、然該地商貨運輸、巳受時局影饗、頓形銳減矣</p>
<h3>福州市面安定</h3>
<p>滬上某英輪公司福州分行主任、昨有電訊來滬、報告閩省近狀、謂近數日中、福建方面形勢已漸緩和、市面平定、恐慌稍減、貨物仍有裝出云云、又據乘恒生輪到滬之旅客言、近數日福州市上、一如平日、連武裝兵士亦少見、刻下閩省當局、急欲遷政府於漳州、至於十九路軍部隊、大多數調往建甌方面邊界云、</p>
<h3>捲烟水泥火柴三統稅昨日實行增加　統稅署發表新稅率</h3>
<p>財政部改訂之海關新稅則、擬定於明年一月一日起實行、至捲烟·水泥·火柴·等三項統稅、業於昨日起實行增加、兹將統稅署昨日發表之捲烟等新稅率錄下、（火柴）火柴稅率、本無分類徵收、今則分爲硫化及安全兩類、硫化火柴、分甲乙兩種稅率、甲種每大箱徵十元八角、乙種十三元五角、安全火柴分甲乙丙三項稅率、甲種每箱組織十三元五角、乙種十七元四角、丙種二十一元、小箱照十分之一計算、（捲烟稅率、甲等由每五萬枝徵五十五元之稅率增至八十元、乙等由九十五元增至一百六十元、（水泥）水泥新稅率、計每一百七十公斤、徵一元二角、一百十三公斤又三分之一徵八角、八十五公斤徵六角、六十三公斤又二分之一徵四角六分、五十六公斤又三分之二徵四角、四十九公斤又十分之九徵三角六分、四十二公斤又五分之一徵二角、</p>
<h3>加徵捲烟稅後廠商堅决反對　同業公會今日開會討論</h3>
<p>大公社云、財部近以國庫支絀、軍政各費、需欵孔殷、爲略事彌補計、爰於昨日起、將火柴·水泥·捲烟·三統稅、一律實行加徵、惟各廠商均紛紛反對、兹將各情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>捲煙同業今日開會</h3>
<p>本市捲烟業同業公會、以本市捲烟事業、邇因社會購買力薄弱、銷路頗見衰落、各烟廠停閉者頗多、今財部突然加徵統稅、將更使營業發生重大影響、故特定於今日下午二時、在梅白格路會所、召開大會、討論應付辦法、决一致請求緩徵、又據捲烟業公會委員王文景談、關於增加捲烟統稅事、業巳派員與當局恊商數項、請求爲顧念商艱、暫緩實行、稅署方面已允轉呈財部請示辦理、但昨日起、所有各廠出品、已一律照新章徵稅、</p>
<h3>稅署表示奉令辦理</h3>
<p>據稅務署負責人稱、稅署此次加徵統稅、係奉部令辦理、廠商有何意見、署方祗能將原意轉</p>
<h3>閩方前日下動員令　聞將分兩路犯浙　中央軍準備迎擊</h3>
<p>新聲社云、閩方軍事企圖、北犯浙江、業已在開始動員中、新聲社記者、昨晨晤及前日由閩來滬之某君、據談、閩方巳任命邱兆琛爲犯浙先遣司令官、所部有兩團之衆、已奉令向浙閩邊境開拔、新組織之第五路軍司令譚啓秀、已遄返閩北原防、譚與其餘各路司令官、曾有一度之軍事會議、内容甚秘密、現蔡廷鍇巳將與其司令部自漳州移駐福州、聞己於四日下午十時下總動員令、其行軍犯浙之戰略、聞將分兩路挺進、傳聞左翼將自閩西犯浙南、右翼則沿閩海岸綫進窺瑞安與温州、又新聲社記者調查、中央在浙邊之軍事佈置、業已就緒、劉和鼎已誠懇表示擁護中央、已與中央軍、取密切聯絡、閩軍左翼如來犯即予以迎頭痛擊、温州亦可防止閩軍右翼、且海空軍亦均有凖備、戰事爆發、皆可同時出動、據軍事家之觀察、閩變毫無軍事價值、倘閩方果甘冒不韙、則戰事開始、結束必快、蓋十九路軍必不堪久戰之支持也、</p>
<p>呈上級、一切辦法、尚須由財部取斷、稅署方面實無權單獨允准也、嗣後各廠捲烟、非貼新印花、不准領照出廠、否則即予扣留云、</p>
<h3>新舊稅率比較增加</h3>

<h3>平民工廠籌委會昨晨開會討論進行　房屋修理需費極鉅　核减半數積極進行</h3>
<p>市社會局在高境廟平民住所、創辦平民工廠、以救濟戰區失業工人、其計劃早經呈准市府、並組織籌備委員會、主持一切、昨晨九時各籌備委員復假市社會局舉行會議、討論縮减修理費及各項進行辦法、兹分誌如下、</p>
<h3>創辦工廠動機</h3>
<p>自一二八滬戰以後、吳淞閘北一帶、盧舍蕩然災民流離失所、無家可歸者、不知凡幾、戰區善後委員會、有鑒及此、特撥欵三萬元、交由市社會局設法救濟、乃由市社會局長吳醒亞主張籌辦一平民工廠、以收容戰區失業工人、當經擬具計劃、組織籌備委員會呈准市府、並轉咨實業部備案、</p>
<h3>先辦木工等部</h3>
<p>按平民工廠之創設、純以救濟戰區失業工人爲目的、惟因經費有限、故先分期舉辦、嗣有成效、再謀擴充、第一期先辦木工、銅器草織印刷皮件等五部、暫定工人名額爲四十名、因上列五部設備、較爲簡單、故先開辦、</p>
<h3>附設一傳習所</h3>
<p>平民工廠開辦成立後、先從木工部份、附設一傳習所、嗣後得視事實上之需要與否、再增設各部、凡本市失業工人、經該所審查合格、郎可收容、但祇供膳宿、不另給薪、所有職員、亦大半由社會局職員兼理、以節省經費、其他必須聘任之專任職員、則亦以能盡義務者爲原則、</p>
<h3>核减修理費用</h3>
<p>平民工廠籌備委員會、以救濟戰區失業工人、不容再緩、爰於今晨召集會議、討論縮减裝修費及各項進行辦法、出席委員張振逺·陳冷僧·王剛·陳寳驊·秦宏濟等五人、討論結果、因高境廟平民住所房屋、建築欠固、前次大風時巳被吹坍不少、故須大加修葺、曾托市工務局估計裝修費用、共需六千餘元、惟因限於經費、故决議核减至三千元、先就平民住所房屋三分之一範圍修理、其餘俟另籌經費後再行擴充、惟該處盡係泥地、大雨以後泥濘難行、尚須設法加鋪煤屑、故本年年底開工籌備己屋不及、故須展至明春二三月方能開辦、</p>

<h3>兩輪階級與四輪階級</h3>
<p>— 錢仁康</p>
<p>上海所以會成爲一個大都市，原因固有多種；但如果没有熱閙的馬路，縱横錯雜地舖陳着，决不會如此繁華：而馬路之所以熱閙，大部分是由於各色各樣的車輛的點綴。在這各色各樣的車輛中，比較有地位的，自然是汽車和包車。</p>
<p>現在是什麽都有「階級的，我們姑且就把坐包車的大人先生們稱爲「兩輪階級」，坐汽車的大人先生們帮爲「四輪階級」吧。</p>
<p>無論是「兩輪階級」或四輪階級」，車夫是大家都有的。包車夫要兼做駛車的原動力，生活方面自然比汽車夫苦得多，而其地位之低，又逺在汽車夫之下；不但在汽車夫之下，而且在一切的車夫之下；不但在一切的車夫之下，甚至有人以爲在畜生之下。因爲，他們的車上不但載人，有時車上的人還要帶一個巴哈狗。至於其牠的車夫，地位方面自然要高得多；神氣十足的汽車夫固不必說，就是終日與畜生爲伍的馬車夫，也還可以時常揚起鞭子來擊幾下馬背，地位决不至在畜生之下。</p>
<p>如此說來，坐包車的「兩輪階級」，顯然有些不很「人道」，而最有威風，最合人道」，而且最「文明」的，自然是坐汽車的「四輪階級了；許多大人先生們都紛紛從兩輪階級」升到「四輪階級」去，大概就是這道理吧？你看喇叭響處，萬人廻避；風馳電挈，驅騁自如，眞是有聲有勢！然而有時也不免給人駡　聲市虎」，那大概是因爲偶而輾死了幾個人的緣故；但人之所以會被輾死，據說是一人」自己不當心，在汽車本身，依然是很「文明」，很「人道」的！</p>
<h3>人生觀的豬化</h3>
<p>— 周黎民</p>
<p>「人生觀」是個抽象的名詞，頗有哲學的意味，含義深廣。狹義的說，就是人們生活的方式，處世的態度，所持的觀念；無論他是樂觀也好，悲觀也好，達觀也好，×觀也好，總之各人有各人的人生觀，有如其面般的不同。」豬玀，「豬頭三」，「胖豬」，「肥豬」，「×豬」這是挪揄一般衣裳架造糞機的人們，也是辱駡一輩無才者的口吻。</p>
<p>這末免妙用「豬」字吧？豬果有知，定呼寃哉枉也呀？不，决不；誰都知道，豬的生活殊爲簡單，别無甚麽豬生觀，兹以六個方式賅之。</p>
<p>第一方式：吃……睡……排泄。</p>
<p>第二方式：睡……吃……排泄。</p>
<p>第三方式：排泄……睡……吃。</p>
<p>第四方式：吃……排泄……睡。</p>
<p>第五方式：睡……排泄……吃。</p>
<p>第六方式：排泄……吃……睡。</p>
<p>豬的生活不過如是，除此以外，别無敬業樂羣的觀念，克盡厥職，鞠躬盡瘁，死而後己的責任心；或許豬的所謂豬生觀，就是那樣吧？</p>
<p>我以爲一般賴祖宗遺產的無業游氓，只會分利，而不能生利，也不過睡，吃，排泄而己：除此以外，終年無所事事，若輩表面爲一個「人」，而所抱者乃豬生觀，不大可哀乎！</p>
<h3>没脚蟹與無核棗</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>這是兩段趣事，似乎可以相偶，如今把它叙述出來，</p>
<p>有個姓解的，在前清時爲某省的府尹，異常勢利，他的小舅子，是個佐貳，到省來候補，解很瞧不起他的小舅子，因爲他的官職，實在太卑了，一天解請了許多名公顯官來賞菊飲酒，他的小舅子想，這正是一個好機會，借此可以和那要人們晤叙，或爲進身的梯階，可是解很不贊成，恐卑卑未秩，列席其間，未免與自己的體面攸關，不知怎樣：被他的老婆知道了，出語怨怪他，解没有法想，祗好請小舅子來陪客，不料那小舅子談吐雋雅，應酬圓到，很得那些名公顯宦的稱許，解很是妒嫉，旣而席間行令屬對，解借此譏諷道：磕頭蟲終居人下，他的小舅子，才思很敏捷，立應答道：没脚蟹休逞己能，解是截脚的蟹字，眞巧極了，</p>
<p>在張長腿時代，虧公欵數萬金的山東某縣知事章某，他本是個拍馬好手，前在某署爲僉事，一天，章和署長同赴某處長家宴，處長偶出蜜棗餉客，署長啖了一枚，深讚此棗無核，隨手取一枚給章，章啖棗得核，强咽下去，署長問他怎麽樣，章說棗没有核，眞是佳種，署長呌他再啖，便連進若干，棗核幾塞咽喉，署長問處長，這棗產自何地，何以無核？處長道；這是尋常的棗，那得無核，署長瞧了章某一眼，章很不自然的說道：間有有核的，署長道：何以没見你吐核，章羞慚没有對答，一時傳爲笑柄，</p>
<h3>青皮橘子</h3>
<p>— 朱研</p>
<p>偶然，在市上小販的水菓攤上，瞥見幾隻青皮橘子。它那圓溜溜緑油油的形態，刺入了我的眼簾，接着，就撳盪了我破創的心弦。</p>
<p>照理呢，這許多尚未成熟的青皮橘子，還得護養在果園裏：受陽光的撫慰，肥料的滋培，和清水的灌溉啦！不該這麽早就陳列在市上求沽。可是那殘忍的園丁啊，只圖自己的利益，不顧你成熟了没有，生吞活剥地從樹枝上摘下，作自己謀利的工具。使你不再有會釀成甘美的果汁的一天。</p>
<p>啊！我這流浪者的命運，不也和那些不幸的青皮橘子一樣？絶大的經濟阻力，勒迫還應該在學府裏求深造的青年，不得不中途丢棄了書本，擊碎了迷夢，斷送了前途，飽含着眼淚進社會做牛馬。但他的本質原來成熟，所有的只是貧瘠，酸澀！他從此没有福份再受温柔太陽的熱力，肥料水份的培養。他更不會變成動人的金黄色彩，釀出豐富甘美的果汁。他祗能翹首艶羨幸運的同伴，日向成功的道余邁進，而自己永逺是愚劣，貧乏，和枯澀！最後的結果，終不外乎被人遺棄在路側。</p>
<p>青皮橘子呀！你受厄於貪婪的園丁，本質未成熟就遭採摘，我被困於萬惡的金錢，學識未充實就問世應用，我深切的同情你，憐憫你。啊！你原是我命運的象徵！</p>

<p>世界珍聞</p>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<h3>最奇的遺囑</h3>
<p>這是一張全世界最奇特的遺囑，在瓦陸地方，有一個波蘭人，他在臨死的時候說，他的無線電機，死後要放在棺材裏，聽音管要裝在耳朶上，他的烟管，四磅烟草，一個圓圓（玩具）都是他的愛物，也要放在棺材的裏面。</p>
<h3>富翁的减少</h3>
<p>在荷蘭國，一九三一年的百萬富翁，和去年相較，去年意减少了二四九人，不景氣象的是否影響荷國，便成了一個疑問。去年的統計，荷蘭的百萬富翁，一共一，０五七人，但一九三一年却有一，三０六人。他們所有的財產，已由二，九三一，０００，０００元，降至二，三二三，０００，０００元；同時全國所付的薪金，也已由四，三六七，０００弗路林降至四，二０六，０００，０００弗路林了；所有荷蘭國的納稅者，同時也由一五，六二三，０００，０００，降至一四，三００，０００，０００弗路林了。</p>
<h3>勇敢的婦人</h3>
<p>一輛特别快車，載了許多客人和行李，在鐵道上前行，司機的人，並不留意，但前面在這座橋是新近坍倒的，開過去要發生危險了。然而他忽然看見一塊紅的披紗鋪在鐵路上，是印度婦人的服裝，有幾個婦人立在紗的兩端，於是他便拉了幾聲回聲，很急促，但那些婦人，竟不動絲毫，結果使他不能不塞車。可是塞車的地方，和那頂坍橋祇有幾碼的相隔，事情發生在印度的孟買。</p>
<h3>美國的高路</h3>
<p>在美國，高原道路不久將有三百萬哩長了，一九三二年年底，能夠通行汽車的高原道路，巳有八七五，０００哩，其中二七五，０００哩是省道。全美的高原路，現在却有三，０四０，０００哩，其中省道三六０，０００哩，國道二，六八０，０００哩，在省道中，更包括二００，０００哩根有趣的高路。</p>
<h3>鴿子新紀錄</h3>
<p>在俄國奥地薩地方，有一頭傳書鴿，由逺處飛回家裏，竟飛行了一，三００哩的路程。這鴿子在莫斯科賣去過兩次，由愛鴿的人買在家裏，但兩次會飛回家裏，根據原主人所說，這鴿子恐怕己打破了世界紀錄。</p>
<h3>會送信的狗</h3>
<p>一頭德國種的狗，原來的主人，不知道是誰。最近在郵政局門前，守他的主人萊恩斯，他是一個老練的送信者，每天帶了信，要跑兩次，到南蘇當波丹去。數年之前，這狗總是跟着他一天跑兩次，但萊恩斯最近己到達了所限的年齡而告退了，可是這旅行在狗的生命史上，是一件重要的事，因此，他雖然對那狗說明了原委，而這隻狗，却老是守在郵政局的門口，不肯去跟新的主人。</p>
<h3>香蕉的宣傳</h3>
<p>德國國社黨的宣傳，在奥國是禁止的，然而這裏發生一件用香蕉當宣傳品的奇事。一船鮮菓到了維也納之後，分銷於全城的商人，那知每一隻香蕉的上面，却都印着爲奥國禁止的希特勒化的標記。警察開始干涉了，雖然仍舊准許出售，但不許在水菓攤上公開陳列，他們更攝了照片，以作證據。</p>
<h3>隨筆</h3>
<p>— 安夫</p>
<p>倘能收集中國所有私　的勇氣，而一致對外，我可以相信他的事業，一定要比拿破侖更偉大。</p>
<p>世界上最可貴的東西，只有同情心；因爲只有它是不能用金錢來買的，也不能用勢力來强求的。</p>
<p>在感情極端衝動的時候，若能用冷靜的頭腦細細的考慮一下：這便是你最可靠的判斷。</p>
<p>理智勝過情感的人，只是一個平凡的人；只有情感勝過理智的人，方能成爲一個超越的歹人或好人。</p>

<p>桂枝賞玩了一會子，覺得身上凉颼颼的，就走回屋子裏面來。不料他在那個時候，只管看了菊花出神，却忘了身上穿的是一件單薄的布夾衫，進得房來以後，再去找衣服來加凉時，身上已經有些疲乏，慢慢的，頭腦有些昏沉沉的，竟是受了感冒了。一個人心裏煩悶到無可奈何的時候，就很有要睡覺的脾氣，旣是身體不爽，那索興就上坑去躺下罷。他展開了被褥，把枕頭疊得高高的，將身子斜靠在上面，只把被斜蓋了下半截。臉半側着，眼睛也緩緩的后了縫。江氏在外面屋子裏作事呢，也不曾理會，半日的工夫，不聽到裏面屋子裏有一點動靜，心裏這就想着，這個孩子的性格，近來常是有些變動了。一個人不是在院子理站着發楞，就是一個人坐在屋子裏撑了頭傻想，有時候自己歎着氣。會自言自語的，說出一句兩句話來。這都爲着什麽？這個時候，許久不作聲，也許又是犯了他那個脾氣了。江氏如此想着，就伸頭由門簾子縫裏向裏一望，桂枝的臉，正是向着房門這邊躺了下去的，在簾子縫裏一張，却看一個對着。只見他兩腮紅紅的，泛出兩大圓暈，眼睛眶子邊，正有兩行眼淚，向下面横流着。江氏看到這種情形，倒嚇了一跳，什麽事委屈了他，倒哭起來了。（二六０）</p>

<h3>巴黎中國畫展經過（五）</h3>
<p>五月十日下午三時、中國美術展覽會在堡姆博物館舉行開幕禮、先由我國駐法顧公使及法國教育部長蒙齊君聯名發出書帖、邀請法國朝野上下、參與其盛、是日到會者、我國除顧公使顧夫人、蕭參事、謝秘書、李總領事、及中法工商銀行、中國代表劉符誠、及畫展籌備人徐悲鴻張鳳舉劉厚諸君外、尚有男女同學二百餘人、法國則到教育部長美術次長、各博物院院長、美術視察員、各界名流、各報記者、及美術家二千餘人轟轟烈烈、恐爲華人在法宣傳空前之盛、開幕儀式、極爲簡單、僅由籌備諸人領導顧公使蒙部長及來賽等參觀一週、經兩小時之久、始行竣事、彼等無不爭相贊賞、備致嘉譽、新聞記者復爭相拍照、一時電光閃灼、令人迷離、數月來經營之苦、頓隨此烟消雲散矣、</p>
<p>畫展開幕之後、觀者極爲踴躍、入門票每人五佛郎、購者約二萬五千餘人、中國學生及法國各美術、各教育機關人員往觀者、均未納費、畫展目錄、每本售十佛郎、共售三千册、故門票與目錄兩項共收約十二萬佛郎以上、民國十八年、日本政府也曾借堡姆博物館開日本畫展、其收人僅十萬佛郎、此次吾國畫展較多二分之一、且值世界經濟恐慌時代、其成績可想而知、然而收入之丰嗇、與吾人毫無關係、因博物館旣係借用、則一切收入、均爲法國國庫所有、吾人之所得者、惟觀衆之贊美與報紙之稱譽耳、以我内憂外患頻仍之際、日本人以重金收買輿論、專爲議詈華人之文、今此畫展、使一般人不能不發生好感、不能不說好話、於我國家未始不無小補也、</p>
<p>畫展期限、原定一月、因詢觀衆之請求、展期兩次共開四十五天、在此期内、各國報紙批評畫展之文字、不下二百餘篇、英俄德意法各國文字都有、兹爲節省篇幅、及免重複計、特選譯十餘種於次、以概一般、此外有外國各報對於畫展之評論者、</p>
<p>巴黎時報（五月十二日）有米萊著論云、中國之生存、猶之生物之增長、必需罹受痛苦、而後方能發達者、故其内亂也、饑荒也、遭人之侵略也、適足以爲彼之思想家、神秘派、藝術界之興奮劑、以今證古、莫不如此、近觀其美術展覺會之組織、吾人更難信此令人感動之中國、己到最後之呼吸也、在彼國難期中、籌辦中國畫展、本極艱難之工作、然中央大學教授徐悲鴻君及中法大學代表劉厚君等、竟能敏捷以成之、此種活動、非能世代保存固有之精神之民族、曷克臻此、</p>
<p>巴黎週報（五月十二日）盧海多著、中國現處困難之秋、總不能運其古代名畫來法、然觀其生氣勃勃、令人注意之近代畫展、己大可爲吾人賞嘆不置之開商、蓋中國圖畫之各種作風、及其各種趨勢、均於此有極高價值之代表著作也、（中略）吾人於中大教授徐悲鴻君携來之現代著作、宜格外加以敬禮、徐君乃中國現在繪像之最著名者、吾人又於高奇峯君之帆船、王一亭君猛烈的達厚、國民黨中央委員陳樹人君之瀑布、及其使人有流動感覺之桃花帶兩一作、潘天授君之運花及葉季英君之廬山風景、吾人均不能不特别讚譽、然諸如此類尚多、吾人又不能不自恕其未能一一詳及之也、（下略）</p>

<h3>黑人問題</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>看近來的報紙，使我相信上海的新聞編輯先生裏面竟有極端老實的人物。例如對於這樣一則消息：</p>
<p>「路透社美國巴狄摩廿八日電：美國梅麗倫州，十月十八日發生私刑處死　　一黑人案。州長昨夜派兵一隊，至肇事地點，拘捕案中要犯九人。但地方官藉詞推諉，不即辦理，致軍隊僅拘獲三人。美國懲辦私刑者之困難，於此可見一斑。」</p>
<p>這本是一件平常的事，但有的報上却加上「美國亦有私刑歟？」這樣的標題。意謂美國是個文明國家，照理是不應尚有私刑的了。</p>
<p>這是太相信了文明國這個名詞的表面的意美之做。倘照這意義，則不但私刑應該絶跡；即對於黑人的歧視，也早巳不應存在了。在上面這個消息中，比擅用私刑意義更重大的，其實還是對於黑人的迫害。</p>
<p>但這也不是足以驚詫的事。一七七六年美國獨立宣佈了萬人平等自由之旨，一八六三年林肯大總統雖然發布了解放黑奴的命令，但這些都是美麗的謊話，至今黑人還不曾得到公平的待遇。據美國南部諸州的所謂ＪimＣrowＬaws，電車和公共汽車中，特别在後方劃一區域，給黑人乘坐，連學校及停車塲的等候室中，黑人亦不得與白人雜處。在劇塲中，黑人倘闖入白人的坐席，例當被處「私刑」。</p>
<p>對黑人用私刑，並不是一種罪惡，一種恥辱。美國的報紙上，常常用着很大的標題公表這種新聞。用刑之酷者，甚至積了薪把黑人活活地燒死。</p>
<p>但無論是這樣的黑人，或同樣的猶太人，到底都不會在文明人種的虐殺和壓迫之下消滅，反之，雖是人種中極其從順温和的黑人，至今也發生了人種意識及階級意識而覺醒起來了，便是白人們自己，也巳覺悟到專用「恐怖」的手段，不能使這人種永不翻身了，Ｓiegfried說「向南，向北，都找不出這個問題的解决之道。色　問題，使我們墮入恐怖的深淵。」（ＡmericaＣomegofＡgc）　　據有一派人的意見，則只要黑人在社會上更加進步，白人能夠反省，然後兩者進於共存共榮之道，問題就可解决。</p>
<p>但據ＳcottＮoaring的意見，以爲只有黑人勞動大衆互相握手，共同建設一個新的社會組織，然後美國的黑人解放，方能實現。</p>
<p>兩派意見，孰是孰非，那祇好等將來的事實來證明了。</p>
<h3>水滸傳的作者</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>水滸傳的人和者，相傳爲施耐庵。</p>
<p>施耐庵是一個傅疑的人物。明郎瑛七修類稿中，稱水滸爲宋江，旣說乃杭人羅本貫中所編，又說是錢塘施耐庵的本。高儒百川書志，載忠義水滸傳一百卷，也說是錢塘施耐庵的本，羅貫中編次。還有李卓吾忠義水滸傳序，就說水滸爲施羅二公發憤之作。只有王圻續文獻通考把水滸傳列入經籍，僅題羅貫著。如今所見明本水滸，有不題撰著人的，有題施耐庵編輯的，有題施耐庵集撰，羅貫中纂修的。究竟水滸一書是施耐庵所著呢？還是羅貫中所著呢？或者是兩人合著呢？明朝人已經弄不明白了。</p>
<p>周亮工因樹屋書影裏說：「水滸相傳爲洪武初越人羅貫中作，又傳爲元人施耐庵作。……近日金聖嘆自七十回之後，斷爲羅貫中所續，極口詆羅，復僞爲施序於前，此書遂爲施有矣。」可見說施耐庵作水滸，直到明清之際，金聖嘆綫確定，而且他還斷定水滸七十回之後爲羅貫中所續。近人吳梅氏在地的顧曲塵談中，說是「幽閨爲施君美作，君美名惠，即作水滸傳之耐庵居士。」他認定施耐庵兼爲戲曲家，不知何所根據。到了胡適之作水滸傳考證，又說施耐庵大概是烏有先生亡是公一流的人，是一個假設的名字。這眞呌我們迷惑了！</p>
<p>是一年前罷，看到某報副刋載有胡瑞亭氏的施耐庵世籍考，好像施耐庵確有其人。他說：「瑞亭因奉公調查户口，迤邐長途，按户編籍，至東臺屬之白駒鎭，有施家橋者，見其宗祠中所供十五世祖諱耐庵，心竊疑焉。詢其族裔，乃悉即著水滸之施耐庵。更索觀族譜，得耐庵小史，曁殘零之墓誌。」耐庵小史，耐庵墓誌，這裏不錄。這樣說來，水滸確爲施耐庵作，施耐庵確有其人，至今還有族譜可證，族裔可詢。自認有考據癖有歷史癖的胡聖人，要是看到了這消息，豈不是一件快事？</p>
<p>倘若胡瑞亭氏的那篇文章不說謊，果有東臺施氏的族譜可考而且可靠，那就自明清以來關於施耐庵的疑案可以解决了。第一，我們知道施耐庵名子安，元朝末年淮安人，曾官錢塘，不得志而去。他曾親見張士誠的起兵，士誠失敗時，他己死了，年七十五。他的生卒，約在西元一二九０－一三六五之間。第二，施耐庵的著述，不止水滸。還有志餘，三國志演義，隋唐志傳，三遂平妖傳等書。羅費中確爲施耐庵門人，曾替耐庵做過著述幫手。</p>
<h3>觀海京伯馬戲叢感</h3>
<p>— 葉永蓁</p>
<p>一　象的倒立</p>
<p>因爲是亂世之民，對於跟前的事物，頗想多看一點，於是乎我買了六毛錢的門票，走進海京伯馬戲班的塲裏坐下着一次馬戲了。</p>
<p>一開幕，就是印度巨象的技術表演。有五隻象頭上都裝璜着幾粒光亮亮金屬的東西，叮叮噹噹地隨着一位教練的人走進這塲裏，先打了一個圈了。</p>
<p>這五隻象脚步走得很整齊。别人且不管他，在我，是從來未曾看過象會做戲的，所以很仔細地在看着，帶點好奇心</p>
<p>當那一個圈子打完了之後，那一位教練的人手裏揑着的鞭在地面一響，五隻象都按着自己的位置站住了。</p>
<p>最初的表演是每隻象提起了前面的兩隻脚，而讓後面的另兩隻脚伏着。這情形，做得很純熟，彷彿有什麽習慣了牠們似的。</p>
<p>於是，塲裏面看的人都笑。</p>
<p>爲了這笑，不知道牠們聽懂了人們的恭維，感受了這教練的人的暗示，這五隻豎立起來的象，前肢都像作揖那麽地，不住地上下動着，在原地更轉了一個圈子。</p>
<p>自然，人們也更加笑了。這回是人們自己受了象的恭維。</p>
<p>這樣，接下去的就是象的疊羅漢，有一隻象鼻端捲着兩面「青天白日滿地紅」的旗，而另四隻分站在兩旁，後邊的象用前肢伏在前邊的象背，象鼻也都高高地捲了起來。</p>
<p>人們更加大笑，而且有人在拍掌。這回不僅是我們這些黄面孔的人們自己受用前肢伏在前邊的象背，象鼻也都高高地捲了起來。</p>
<p>人們更加大笑，而且有人在拍掌。這回不僅是我們這些黄面孔的人們自己受了象的恭維，連國家也受了象的恭維了　　不消說，這是體面的事啊！</p>
<p>然而我自己覺得也笑過一次，這是在最後，當這五隻象表演倒立的時候。</p>
<p>以這樣軀體肥大的動物，把前肢伏在地面，而將後肢拼命地抬起放在空間，以求取悅於人，那你想，這苦心，是多麽值得人同情的，而這情狀，也多麽值得人發噱的呢！</p>
<p>我於是不得不笑。</p>
<p>這五隻印度的巨象，表演到這裏做了一個結束，牠們頭上帶着那幾粒光亮亮金屬的東西，仍是呆叮叮噹噹地響着，聽了那教練的指揮，高高興興地走回「獸苑」裏去了。脚步也是那麽的整齊。</p>
<p>我於是也不得不有所感：</p>
<p>在印度的喜馬拉雅山裏，喀喇崑崙山裏，興都庫什山裏，蘇里曼山裏，高止山裏，有多麽遼闊的森林，上負巉岩，下臨溪澗，這些象在那邊住養，不必做這許許多多的表演，而生活優游自得，那不好嗎？何必一定要跟着人，聽了他手裏揑着的鞭的指揮，做這麽一套那麽一套學起來而又費力的事，也只僅求牠們自己一生的温飽，而還出盡了牠們種種的醜，這於牠們究竟有仠麽好處呢？難道說，以牠們的自由，換得頭上幾粒光亮亮的金屬的東西，觀客們的一陣鬨笑，就足以相抵嗎？</p>
<p>我想，誰也不會這麽想吧，假若幾隻象還更聰明一點的。</p>
<p>然而據說象雖是頂龐大的動物，但也是頂馴服的動物，而且據說象之被捕於人，是先有了一隻象的内奸去引誘牠自己的同類來共同享受這苦厄的運命的，－那末，倘如這樣想時，我覺得就爲了自己，也有幾分惴惴然了。</p>
<p>我們這民族，也不是據說頂龐大，頂馴服而且頂會出内奸的嗎？</p>
<p>那就什麽也都可以預測了，是不是呢，諸位？</p>

<h3>兩兄弟（五十）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>尤其是他的父親，使得他觸目驚心。這柔弱的，滿足而又愚傻的胖子，是哲安的父親嗎？不是，不是，哲安和他毫没有相似的地方。</p>
<p>他的家庭！兩天以來便有一隻陌生的，險惡的手，一個死人的手，把捼繫這四個人的一切關係，一個一個地拔了毁了。現在什麽都完了，什麽都己被搗毁了。他再没有母親了，因爲他再不能疼愛她了，他再不能懷着那種兒子們的心裏所必需有的，温柔而又虔誠的，絶對的敬意去尊敬她了；他再没有弟弟了，因爲他這弟弟是一個陌生人的兒子；留下給他的祇有一個父親，祇有這胖子，而這胖子却無論如何是他所不愛的。</p>
<p>他突然說道：</p>
<p>「喂，媽媽，你尋着那肖像了嗎？」</p>
<p>她張着吃驚的眼睛：</p>
<p>「什麽肖像？」</p>
<p>「瑪賴沙的肖像。」</p>
<p>「没有＾我没有去尋，不過我想我可以尋出來的。」</p>
<p>「你們說的什麽？」羅蘭問。</p>
<p>筆爾對他說：</p>
<p>「從前我們住在巴黎時放在客廳裡的一張瑪賴沙的肖像。我想哲安一定高興得到這張肖像的。」</p>
<p>羅蘭呌道：</p>
<p>「對啦，對啦，我完全記起來了；並且上星期末我還看到這張畫像的。你母親整理紙頭時，曾把它從書桌裡拿出來過。這是星期四或星期五的事情。你還記得嗎，践易兹？當時我止在刮鬍子，你把那畫像從一隻抽斗裡拿出來，和一堆信一塊放在你身旁的一張椅子上，你把那堆信燒了一半，不是嗎？在哲安得到他的遺產之前祇兩三天，你曾觸到這張肖像，這不奇怪嗎？假如我相信情感的話，我一安會說這也是預感之一啦！」</p>
<p>羅蘭嬤嬷泰然回答道：</p>
<p>「是啦，中啦，我知道這張肖像在什麽地方；我就去把它尋來。」</p>
<p>然則她撒了謊啦！就在今天早上，她的兒子問她這張畫像弄到什麽地方去了，她回答時也還撒了謊啦：「我記不大清楚了……也許在我的寫字台裡罷。」</p>
<p>在幾天之前，她曾看到，獨到，摸過，瞧過這張畫像，隨後她又把它藏在那秘密的抽斗裡，我一些書信一塊，和她的私書一塊·</p>
<p>筆爾瞧着他那撒謊的母親。他以一種被欺負，被騙去了神聖的愛的兒子的激怒，他以一種许久以來盲目着而終於發覺了一宗可恥的奸情的男子的嫉妬瞧着她。假使他是這女人的丈夫時，他會抓着她的　腕，抓着她的兩肩成是抓着她的頭髮，把她擲在地上，打她，踢她，蹂躪她！可是他現在什麽也不能够說，什麽也不能够做，什麽也不能够表示，什麽也不能够揭穿。他是她的兒子，他没有什麽仇可報，人家並没有欺負過他。</p>

<p>街亦辦蕪湖機元一百三十一包、價七元六角、湖南機元一百二十八包、價同、昨客化活動、人心亦爲轉定、但行情則較小角外、因客帮雖有辦意、然無暢買之必要、以市面平軟、貨主貶價、故交易轉旺、此後如有繼續暢辦、後市當可轉機也</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>懷柔留日學生</h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>日前中國駐日公使館武官甘介瀾氏聲明「因日本寄宿舍旅館業之虐待，引起留日學生之惡感」後，外務省文化事業部，力謀改良待遇，以便懷柔留日學生，盃彼輩將來歸國，皆爲中國之要人，若非預有良好企圖，一旦返國，勢必大呌抗日，其於中日親善必發生重大影響云。</p>
<p>日本的侵略政策，眞可謂無微不至。人棄我取，我們不能不佩服他的獨具隻眼，賞識到這一班未來的「中國要人」，而預先「燒冷灶」。</p>
<p>「以夷制夷」，是中國歷來傳統的外交政策，故東洋勢力侵入了，就趕緊輸進西洋勢力，以爲抵柱。原用的是以「甲夷」制「乙夷」，而不是用「甲夷中的甲」，制「甲夷中的乙」。但這個乖己給東鄰學去，而更青出於藍的運用起「以華制華」的策略來了。</p>
<p>扶助甲軍閥，打倒乙軍閥，扶助乙軍閥，打倒甲軍閥，這是二十年來日本對華外交的精髓。爲着這個外交政策的成功，便不能不在留日學生中找爪牙。於是盡力宣傳，造出所謂「親日派」「親美派」「聯俄派」等種種名詞，以期用亡韓的故智來分化國人。更對一般留日學生施以一種麻醉教育。這成效是有的，「滿洲國」的造成，便是一個絶好的例證。</p>
<p>日本自製造所謂「滿洲國」後，就處處利用許多留日學生，及知名學者，做他的爪牙。「滿洲國」文教部，教廳，有所謂「王道演講會」，「災區宣慰團」等組織，充當團員的，多半是這些留學生，學者。日本人很知道鄉人崇拜洋學生的心理，故利用他們這張嘴，向民衆大徹烟幕彈，演講所謂「眞主再世，王道復興，滿日親善，民衆安居樂業」等荒謬言辭。日僞軍每大屠殺一次義軍，或洗刦了一個村鎭後，總是要搬出這幫人來講演一陣，讓人民不要反對友軍（日軍）的行動，是爲了要救他們登王道樂土。（詳見生活週刋第八卷四十八期載事變後東北的教育）三千萬人民眞給一二萬日軍所統治得了的嗎？那是全靠了這些爪牙。日本人對中國留日學生所施的教育，總算不是白丢，而我們的留學事業，却全似給日人辦的。</p>
<p>本來留學的原因，在於　慕，爲自己借鏡，而結果竟有給「學」留了去的，不可謂非奇事。我所不懂的，人總稱是有感情，有理智的動物，但中國人何以這樣柔馴·能領受日本的教育到「恰符所望」？那怕不是注定的「苦命」，而是「奴才命」注定的吧？</p>
<h3>復古</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>二十世紀並不算是我們的，因爲一九三三的中國，表面看去，好像是在跟人家一道兒努力地「望前跑」，甚至在大喊着「迎頭趕上」；實際呢，却是在拚命「地開倒車」，「向後轉」，事事盡呈着「復古」的景象！</p>
<p>第一，五四以後，「新文化運動尚未成功」，剛被「束之高閣」的線裝的「經，又有人起來鼓勵讀。據說，經是中國唯一的「寳書」（半部論語就可治天下），中國今日所有的一切學術，無一不是由這裏面分化出來的：「飲水思源」，豈可「棄若蔽屣」？因是「有心人」便「苦心孤詣」，「提倡不遺餘力」。從此「靈光存魯殿」，「吾道不衰」！</p>
<p>次之，被公認爲足以戕害士人，而打倒了的「科舉制度」，現時又居然再附上「普考」「高考」的軀殻而「還魂」了。所差的是，先前考的是「國八股」，今日考的是「洋八股」。至「殿試」後「金榜題名」的「新科狀元」，雖没福再消受到「皇帝娘娘」親手簪花的寵幸；但舉行典禮時，「要人」躬臨來頒發證書，也巳算是榮耀萬分了－况街雖未曾照例遊過，其必不沿用「騎馬」或「乘轎」，而改坐「摩托卡」，則可無疑了。此外，尚有「雷厲風行」過一時的中小學「會考」，也「應運而生」了。是見「新科舉制度」之在今日，猶盛於昔時！</p>
<p>其三，「神怪」「武俠」一類的小說，已見「三令五申」地嚴禁了；連「火燒」大俠」等「爲實踐社會教育使命」而攝製的影片，也遭殃了；但幾被遺棄了的無數曾打過「十八銅人陣」，久隱深山古寺中的「武脚英雄」，和身懷「飛薝走壁」絶技的「江湖好漢」，却幸賴「國考」一舉，得以揚眉吐氣，大顯身手；而數千年一祖傳」的「國術」，也因之得以不至湮殁。正是「天之未喪斯武也！」「我們一面」開科取士」，一面「擺摇臺選英雄」；文武並重，堪稱得計。可惜至今尚没有人能及第高考，同時又在國考被取；否則，文武兩曲星齊降一身的「文武狀元」，行將重見於今之世矣！</p>
<p>以上是榮榮大者，要舉還不少哩！不過，中國今日的「復古」，只復其「半」，未復其「全」。譬如，學校裏古書雖要修，自然科學及社會科學却不能不讀；國術固應熱心提倡，火藥大砲飛機也依然必須凖備。</p>
<p>而且，也有相反的事例，却是非常「趨時」的。那就是那種不可言妙的，典型的，「等因奉此式」的公文，聽說今後竟將改用白話了，甚至目下已實行着添用新式標點和符號。這一奇蹟，在我們這「崇古」的老大的國度裏，己算是「難能可貴」了。誰知還有一位先生不自知足，慨嘆似的說：「白話文的提倡，到如今巳經十多年的歷史了，結果只向六言告示和等因奉此的公文上佔據了幾個標點與符號的地位，就有一大批人的暴怒與不平，我眞不知封建制度的全部掃清，要在那一個年頭」？</p>
<p>復古並不算是壞現象。「物極必反」，中國的文化，現今也許己進步到最高度了，復古自是「必然的趨勢」。蓋「復」者「反」也。記得英國老頭子蕭伯納曾譏笑我們說，「中國無文化」；這簡直是欺人之言！</p>
<h3>靠牌頭</h3>
<p>— 虚存</p>
<p>庶務周先生扳起了面孔對他說道：「你這人好不懂事。前次你來，拿了朱秘書的信來。要是有事做，不留下你，會呌你去的嗎？」</p>
<p>他必恭必敬地站在那裏。周先生說一句，他道一個是字。一直等到說完。他才彎着腰，陪着笑臉，向周庶務說道；「您說的何當不是！不過我的確太苦了。禁不起這好久的没事做。所以我那次回去。就去找吳行長太太。因爲他是我們同鄉。吳行長的塲面又闊。想請她另外找點事做。我去的時候，剛巧太太在家。我就說了去的意思。她說朱秘書寫的信，是靠不大住的。因爲他寫的薦</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>信太多了。就是有好的位置，也有他貼己的人要安插的。她說這裏一定還有缺額。不過照例要留些給上面位置的自己人的。你旣急着要事做，一時又找不到别的。少不得我自己來寫封信吧。你把這信拿去，還是去求求周先生。呌他不要爲難，就說我說的。吳先生來時，我對他說聲就是了。這就是她的信。還求您看吳太太的面上，賞我一點事做。但能過得過去，我也不再二次三番來麻煩您了！」說着，從身上掏出一封信來。雙手呈給周先生。</p>
<p>他俯首恭敬地站在那里，窺探周先生的臉色。</p>
<p>周先生接過信去。看了之後。稍爲怔了一怔。縐了一下眉頭。温和地對他說；「事確乎巳没有了。誰没有親戚朋友相識呢？你想！不過旣有行長太太的信來。你暫且住下，就在我這裏打打雜。等將來我替你設法，補正式的事。</p>
<p>他聽了這話，好比罪犯聽了赦令一般的快活。從此他在庶務室裏，帮助固有的一個僕人，做掃地，打水，倒茶，開燈，種種雜務。件件都做得周到。和周先生一起做事的沈先生，也常常稱贊他。</p>
<p>一天傍晚。周先生呌他把管會客室的阿福喊來。周先生對阿福怒形於色的說道：「我知道你做不做是不在乎的了。你看你管的那會客室。地也不知有幾天不掃了。電燈是通夜亮着。不顧體面，不惜物力。你想　　　　去嗎？趁早把行李收拾收拾，今晚就縷開此地。一　　阿福聽了這話。眞是莫名其妙。發了半天的呆。待回辯吧？犯上又不好！不吧，一肚皮寃氣没處訴！只好抑住了氣憤，緩緩地回道；「地我是天天掃的。您不信好去調查。要是眞的不掃，任您罰我！至於電燈。那是沈先生說。别的房間亮着。那間漆黑，有的不大好看。所以呌我開的。你不信可以去問他」。</p>
<p>「是的，知道你的嘴是很會說明的。不過現在會說也没有用。不要多囉囌。趕緊去收拾行李，回來算工錢。」</p>
<p>阿福只好出去了</p>
<p>一會，沈先生匆匆地走進來。問周先生道：「聽說你要停阿福了？阿福見我幾乎哭出來，請我來向你求情。電燈的確是我呌他開的。其他就有的什麽不是，我看恕了他初次吧。你看怎樣呢？</p>
<p>「老李，你不知道。他們這些人，仗着資格老。又是大來頭。我若不給些怕懼給他們，以後事也就不大好做了。－說着，又低聲道。－而且，行長太太那裏薦來這個雜的，也正閑着没有事做呢。」</p>
<p>沈先生默默地點了點頭。</p>
<p>從此他就管會客室，做從前阿福做的事了。</p>
<h3>一個媽媽的教訓</h3>
<p>— 胡子久</p>
<p>「麟兒，你怎麽今天又獨自一個人溜出到馬路上去了呢」？麟兒的媽媽，十一個中年的婦人－執着剛從里門外逛了回來的麟兒－一個七八歳模樣的孩子的小手問</p>
<p>「因爲那裏很熱閙，在要猴子戲」，現代名人書畫王　字諟齋原籍常州</p>
<p>麟兒答：「所以我就出去看看，媽媽，那隻猴子眞聰明呀！牠會自己穿衣服，自己戴帽子呢」！稚氣未脫的麟兒，在他的小小地腦海裏，還深深地記着剛從里門外所見到的那隻猴子的好玩，對於他媽媽的問話，簡直是一點兒没有聽到</p>
<p>「我不是天天在關照你，小孩子是不好背着大人，獨自一個人跑到馬路上去玩的嗎？麟兒的媽媽，因爲她的問謂，還得不到麟兒的領會便追着問。</p>
<p>「媽媽，你又是說：那邊的馬路上，站着一個滿臉鬍子，頭上纏着黄布的外國人嗎？」麟兒似有所悟的對他的媽媽發着疑問說。</p>
<p>「是的，他是最鼓歡捉小孩子的呀！媽媽說。</p>
<p>「我也知道的。麟兒說：「他是要把我們中國的小孩子，捉去做藥水的」</p>
<p>「我還有别的話關照過你呢！你記着嗎？」</p>
<p>「我都牢記在心裏」。麟兒點着頭說：「那些在馬路跑來跑去的白臉皮，碧眼珠的外國人，他們也都是要捉我們中國的小孩子的。媽媽，是不是」？</p>
<p>「那末，你爲甚麽今天又獨自一個人溜出到馬路上去了呢？」</p>
<p>「我何曾到過馬路！」麟兒緊切地答：「我祇不過在里門口看了一回猴子要戲罷了。後來我在無意中見到離我們里門不逺的馬路上，有一個白臉皮，碧眼珠的外國人，用着棍子在打一個黄包車夫，黄包車夫對他不住地磕頭，我也恐被那個外國人捉了去，連忙跑回到家裏來了。」</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？他們外國人，見了大人，便要用棍子打，見了他們這些小孩子便要捉去做藥水。麟兒，你想，這是多麽可怕呀」</p>
<p>「可怕極了！」麟兒嚇呆了。</p>
<p>「那麽你下次再敢一個人獨自跑出到里門外去玩了嗎？麟兒的媽媽，知道她這一回的訓話，巳收得了相當的效果，心裏很是高興，便進一步問麟兒說。</p>
<p>「媽媽，我下次决計再不敢獨自一個人跑到里門外去閒逛了」。麟兒的小嘴中，終於吐出了這幾句話來。接着麟兒媽媽的臉頰上，也不由她不露出一陣勝利的微笑了。</p>
<h3>人的「加工趕造」</h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>「和平之神」早巳在日内瓦患了不治之症而迫近彌留，戰爭却在俯瞰着歐洲和太平洋的兩岸，作猙獰滿足的微笑！於是，整個在動盪中的世界，都「忙」起來了；各國的巨頭們都「忙」於如何去使他們的政權更加集中化和暴力化；外交家們正「忙」於勾心鬭角，縱横捭闔的拉攏搗鬼；海陸空軍的「閥」字號的人們「忙」於擴大預算，趕造戰艦飛機塘克瓦斯；佛教居士和「上帝兒女」們照歐戰老例，「忙」於「祈禱和平」。在這滔滔者皆「忙」煞哉的緊張空氣中，獨有那老牌黑衫教主慕沙野尼和新牌褐衫教主希特拉兩位，除了「忙」一切帝國主義者所當「忙」而外，更「忙」於鼓勵各該國的「蚩蚩元元」，加工趕製第二代的小國民或小法西斯蒂。「生聚教訓」，「見微知逺」，我們誠然不能不佩服這黑褐兩「星君」的本領，畢竟是逈異凡儔了</p>
<p>慕沙里尼在十月三十日「結婚節」那一天，贈送二千對結婚男女以禮物，同時並贈與在那一天參加受洗大典的嬰兒　入新衣一套：　位首相並尚壽年演說　謂一九三四年將成爲單身　的「四年」，那就是說，政府將對不結婚者科以捐稅。</p>
<p>希特拉在近三月來檢騐了德國一百五十萬青年男女的體格，並和慕沙里尼一樣，奬勵結婚，由政府根據結婚者的申請，可以借與每一對將婚夫婦六百馬克，據十一月二十二日的路透社，柏林向註册處申請借欵的，巳有一萬人之多云。</p>
<p>這種奬勵性交傳種的「新猷」的意義，是很顯然的。第一，說明帝國主義者正在决心走向戰爭，爲了凖備那殺人盈野，血流成河的可怕犧牲起見，各國準備到前線去「爲祖國而戰」的「准砲灰」的壯丁，都有傳種，趕造「候補砲灰」之必要。第二，說明現代戰爭對於人類和一切文明成果之燬滅力的可怕。亂殺亂砍至四年之久的歐戰，結果「只」創造了幾座一共容納二百餘萬戰士的「無名英雄」之墓。然而到現在，經過了十幾年對於殺人技術的「精益求精」，空軍威力的無限發展，化學對於戰爭之更大的應用，使戰爭的破壞力較歐戰時增加了若干倍，使倫敦紐約東京各大都市，隨時都有在敵人空軍的襲擊之下，化爲坵墟的危機。在這種「自掘墳墓」之可怕的戰爭奔競之下，呌聰明絶不在你我之下的帝國主義者如何不顧慮到將來「砲灰」和「產業後備軍」的「絶種」或「出品减少」而憂心如搗－所以慕沙里尼和希特拉之奬勵「製造小國民」，實在是基於戰爭狂熱之實際的需要，旣不僅只是爲了甚麽「改良人種」或「蕃殖人羣」，也不止是爲了替他二位的徒子徒孫「解决性慾問題」也，</p>
<p>奔向戰爭之最前線的木屐「朋友」，爲甚麽竟放棄了這種「奬勵造人」的時髦玩意？這理由很簡單：一，日本人口的增加率原較意德爲高，故用不着「加工趕造」：二，割去滿洲·又獲得了一千多萬（除開「娘兒們」）並不須自己製造的「砲灰」，何妨在戰爭中，「慷」他人之「腦袋」？</p>
<p>帝國主義正在爲了大屠殺而「加工造人」，咱們貴國却正在爲了「抵抗」而提倡「國術」兩下對照，我看到許多同胞的腦袋，己被「預約」要在太平洋烽火燃燒中大跳其舞矣！唉！還說甚麽！</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>我約略叙述了此次的變故，我己决意脫離家庭。以我們所受的教訓，恢復我們的正誼社，我們弟弟雖是個十五歳的孩子，他有堅决的自信力，對於我們的社没有帮助，也不見會得破壞「高飛，允許我的弟弟也來加入嗎」？我注視高飛，同時徵求全席的意見。</p>
<p>「贊成，兩個戀愛專家」！小黄又是第一個跳起來。</p>
<p>二十你還没有老婆。</p>
<p>從酒樓上出來，巳將九點鐘，高飛說今夜你住在社裏罷，小黄重慶，笑風，，都在社裏，免得小黄喊三缺一。</p>
<p>一行人笑着談着，霞飛路上的春風，醉人的迎面吹來，我的心飄飄然，像投在愛人的懷抱裏一樣。細想着兩天來的經過，踏在行人道上震起清脆的脚步聲。</p>
<p>在吕班路口衆人分了手，我們四個向南走去，或者歡悅佔領了各人的心，都踏着瘦長影子點點地走，獨有小黄跳着加官步，倒在地上的人影，正如一個矮的冬瓜，笑風俏皮着同他：</p>
<p>「小黄，今晚搓麻將？」</p>
<p>「好！好！」他忘了在跑路「　一個搭子眞難，有了老婆，都想回家睡覺」。　　「你還没有老婆」？我問。</p>
<p>小黄望了我一眼，摇摇頭，似乎感傷起來。小黄在我們社裏，是著名的樂　　　者，但是　　了老婆，就引起他的悲哀。他自己說道，戀愛不知是仲慶味兒，我没有遇見遇愛我的女人呢！從此我作爲話柄取笑他，他就回敬我「戀　專家」的綽號。</p>
<p>到辣斐德路的社中，小黄納頭向床上一横，重慶和笑風，有意將麻雀牌倒在桌上玩弄，小黄賭氣將棉被蒙了頭，我們相與大笑。</p>
<p>兩小時後，他們都睡熟了。四週寂寞得像死了一樣，間或有一二聲喇叭響飛一設的馳過。我望着天花板，輾轉不能成睡，無奈坐起身來，寫信給敏姊，告訴她今天的事：舅父怎樣敷衍我，表姊對我的情形弟弟的信，最後遇見從前的老朋友，拉雜的寫，寫滿三張信紙。燃了紙烟，重看一遍，又似乎不滿意，何必告訴她這許多呢？突然小黄笑出聲來，我以爲他倫看了我的情形，但翻一個身却又睡熟了大概做了女人的夢吧？自己不免也望着信紙一笑，劃亮了火柴，把三張信紙摺疊着燒掉。重提起筆來簡單的寫了。</p>

<h3>Discovery of the 19th Route Army Around Pinghe; Dabu County Government Sends Urgent Telegram to the Province; Meixian Convenes Military Conference; Decision Made to Deploy Troops to Reinforce Border Defenses; Rumors of Bai Chongxi Feigning Illness and Leaving Nanning</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) More than ten thousand soldiers of the 19th Route Army were discovered around Pinghe on the Fujian border, preparing their horses and weapons, posing a threat to Guangdong. The Dabu County Government of Guangdong has sent an urgent telegram to the province and telegraphed Li Yangjing to reinforce troops for defense. Yang Youmin, a staff officer of the Eastern District Pacification Headquarters, traveled from Shantou to Meixian on the second to meet with Li. On the fourth, Li convened a military conference, deciding to continue to task Huang Renhuan's division with guarding the Fujian-Guangdong border. The Third Army was assigned to defend Fengshun, Meixian, Pingyuan, and Xunwu. Zhang Ruigui's division guarded Chaozhou, Shantou, Jieyang, Raoping, and Puning. Li Zhenliang's division moved to Xingning and Wuhua. A military and police patrol office was established in Shantou. (Hui telegram on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Zhangfu, summoned by Chen Jitang, arrived in the province from the southern route on the fourth to discuss military affairs. Chen Zhang's division, stationed in Shangyou and Chongyi, was ordered to be transferred to Guangdong, and their defenses were to be filled by Hunan troops. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news from Wuzhou, Bai Chongxi feigned illness and left Nanning, his whereabouts unknown. Chen Jitang's representative, Cheng Bijin, telegraphed to Yunnan to report this. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Central Government's Attitude Towards the Southwest</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to political circles, the telegrams sent to the central government by Hu Hanmin, Chen Jitang, and other Central Committee members from the Southwest regarding resolving the current situation contain three points: (1) Details are unknown. (2) Shorten the period of political tutelage and enter the constitutional era as soon as possible. (3) Convene a National Assembly in advance to resolve all national affairs. The central government is largely receptive to some of these points. However, the first point seems somewhat emotional. It is generally believed that the party and the nation are in such a precarious state that anyone with a good strategy to save the country is welcome to take responsibility. The second and third points are urgent and can easily be accepted. However, the only hope is that the Central Committee members in the Southwest, especially Hu Zhantang, the leader of the party and the nation, can immediately and decisively come to Nanjing to discuss concrete solutions. As for Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others in Fujian, because they have openly betrayed the party and the nation, they are public enemies and have no room for leniency or compromise. If they can repent and automatically dissolve their rebel organization, the situation can be reconsidered. The central government's current urging of Zhang Puquan and Ma Chaojun to go south also carries the important mission of conveying this opinion. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Xiao Focheng Denies Forming a Government</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Xiao Focheng today denied rumors that Guangdong will form a third government, saying that the Guangdong authorities are currently only engaged in protecting the territory and pacifying the people, and have no other intentions. He also said that he hopes the 19th Route Army can break away from the rebel party and preserve its prestige. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Military Supplies Purchased by the Fujian Side to be Detained by the Central Government</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that the Fujian rebels purchased military supplies such as airplanes from a certain group and secretly shipped them to China. On the fifth, the foreign affairs authorities stated that the ministry had already notified all countries on the 27th of last month regarding the Fujian rebels' organization of a puppet government, requesting that no assistance be given to the puppet government. Friendly nations are unlikely to provide any assistance. If the military supplies purchased by the Fujian rebels were before this notification, the central government will detain them when they are shipped to China, without any further action.

<h3>Fujian Authorities Implement Tax Retention; Personnel and Administration Still Handled as Usual by the Customs Commissioner</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Fujian has implemented the safekeeping of customs duties. The Min government has decided to rectify tax collection and will raise tax rates on imported goods such as kerosene. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The student who died in yesterday's training institute incident has been buried. More than twenty people were injured. Today, Wang Tingbin and Fu Deping died from their injuries. It is reported that the authorities will severely punish the platoon leader responsible for the incident. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) After the decision to allocate the customs surplus from the three customs houses of Fuzhou, Xiamen, and San Du to the new government, the Xiamen customs duties, originally deposited in the Netherlands-Anda Bank, were transferred to the Bank of China on the first after negotiations by the customs authorities. In the future, the three customs houses will calculate together monthly and allocate the customs surplus at the end of the month. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Lin Hongfei, the director of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau, was transferred to the position of Longxi County Magistrate. Wu Maosong was appointed as his successor by the provincial government and will take office soon. All Japanese-owned casinos in Xiamen were notified by the Japanese Consulate on the fourth to cease operations. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The transfer of the customs house in Fuzhou has been resolved. The customs surplus of 425,000 yuan per month from the three customs houses of Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Sandu will be allocated to the People's Government starting from November 18th. The personnel and administration of the three customs houses will be handled as usual by their respective Customs Commissioners, who will be responsible for allocating this amount monthly. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) To stabilize the business community, the Fujian government today invited representatives from the Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Longyan Chambers of Commerce to Fuzhou to hear the new government's explanation of its objectives. It is reported that the leaders of the People's Government are now willing to declare that the new government is not a communist organization and does not intend to encourage labor movements. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Delu and others, representatives of the Fujian natives in Beijing seeking to suppress the rebellion and save their hometowns, went to the National Government and the Executive Yuan on the morning of the fifth with petitions to request the suppression of Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others. Zhu Wenzhong of the National Government and Councilor Chen of the Executive Yuan received them and gave replies, which the representatives found satisfactory and returned.

<h3>Han Fuqu Investigates Fabricated Telegram; Telegrams Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei to State His Attitude; Decides to Sue Tianjin Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek today, stating: "According to a telegram from Li Zongbi, the director of my office in Peiping, a friend mentioned seeing a telegram from me in a report, stating: 'Your telegram has been received. Brother Bocheng has arrived in Jinan and described everything in detail, showing your concern for Fuqu in every possible way, for which I am deeply grateful. This time, with the outbreak of the Fujian rebellion, there are many who misunderstand you, and the main reason is the impropriety in the selection of personnel and administration. How Chengjun, Chairman of Jiangxi, Xiong Shihui, Secretary-General of the Headquarters, and Yang Yongtai have all commented on this matter long ago. I hope you will remove the treacherous elements closest to you to seek understanding at this time, so that the Red bandits will retreat without being suppressed and the civil war will cease without being fought. These presumptuous words are offered for your consideration, Fuqu respectfully expresses his gratitude.' Upon reading this, I was extremely surprised. Whenever there is a change in the situation, rumors arise. Now, a telegram has been fabricated out of thin air, not only affecting me personally but also causing concern and unrest. I urgently request a thorough investigation to clarify whether you received this telegram and where it came from. I am awaiting your command with utmost urgency." He also telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, stating: "I recently saw the Zhenglun Bao in the Japanese Concession on Fukushima Street in Tianjin on November 28th, reporting on a telegram from me to you, attacking Xiong Shihui, Yang Yongtai, and He Yingqin, and the Zhonghua Evening News on Suma Street in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin on the same day, reporting on my recent attitude. The meaning of the two newspapers is largely the same and is purely fabricated, which is extremely infuriating. Although both newspapers are in the concession, they fabricated rumors without cause, and according to our country's laws, they should be punished accordingly. In addition to having already telegraphed the Ministry of Justice and Administration to instruct the relevant court to prosecute according to law and consulting with Chairman Huang and Chairman Yu on how to adopt effective measures, I respectfully report this matter." (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) A fake telegram, signed by Han Fuqu and addressed to Chiang Kai-shek criticizing inappropriate personnel appointments, was recently discovered in Peiping. After the relevant parties telegraphed Shandong for inquiry, Han Fuqu telegraphed Zhuang Bocheng, stating that he had not sent the telegram himself. In addition to instructing Li Zongbi, the director of the office in Peiping, to investigate nearby, he also requested Zhuang Bocheng to forward the telegram to Chiang Kai-shek and explain everything to He Yingqin.

<h3>Guidance Committee for People's Movement of the Central Government Issues Open Letter Regarding Fujian Rebellion to National People's Organizations; Three Points to Note in Leading the Work of the People</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Guidance Committee for People's Movement of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued an open letter to national people's organizations regarding the Fujian Rebellion. The original text reads: "Since the Red bandits have been rampant and foreign enemies have been encroaching, the central government, in a time of national crisis and imminent peril to the people's lives, has carefully considered strategies to pacify internally and resist externally, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes. Therefore, suppressing the communist bandits and pacifying the people is to treat the symptoms, while production and construction, and the development of the people's strength to enrich the nation, is to solidify the root. Recent implementation has gradually shown signs of progress, and some results are visible. We hoped to unite and fight to save this crisis. However, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others, as members of the Central Committee of the Party or holding important government positions, dared to openly advocate rebellion in Fujian, presumptuously establish a false title, and gather reactionary elements such as the Social Democratic Party, the Third Party, the Communist Party, and the National Socialist Party to organize the so-called Production Party and People's Revolutionary Government. They colluded with the communist bandits internally and flattered the powerful enemies externally, hoping to achieve their selfish goals of offending their superiors and creating chaos, obstructing international opinion, and hindering the overall success of suppressing bandits. Since the founding of the Republic of China, political disputes have been frequent. However, openly daring to abolish the national title of the Republic of China and the national flag and party emblem created by Sun Yat-sen, creating their so-called new country, forming their so-called new party, and changing their so-called new currency, betraying the party and selling the country, has reached an extreme of absurdity and ridiculousness. They erased the historical achievements of our founder Sun Yat-sen and the pioneers of the Republic of China, the sacrifices and consumption of all the martyrs who supported the republic since the founding of the Republic of China and the people of the whole country, the history of the Chinese Kuomintang's arduous struggle to build the Republic of China, and the Three Principles of the People, which the Party espouses, which aims to bring the Republic of China towards the Great Harmony. This is not only that comrades in the Party cannot stand with them on the Party's position, but also that the people of the Republic of China cannot stand with them in the world. Therefore, since the banner of rebellion has been raised, comrades and compatriots at home and abroad have denounced and condemned them, with a unified voice. Our people's organizations at all levels, witnessing the turmoil, will inevitably share this righteous indignation. However, our people's organizations at all levels have the responsibility to lead the people. At this time, work must focus on the following three points: First, consolidate the power of our Party and the nation. Our Party is the party that created the Republic of China, with profound doctrines and solid policies, which have been accepted by people's organizations at all levels. We must unite the people, firmly believe in our Party, shoulder the historical mission of leading the revolution, and unanimously support it to promote the success of the National Revolution. Second, enhance national consciousness. The rebels abandoned the highest principles of survival and happiness for the entire nation and the country, and falsely entrusted themselves to public opinion, betraying the Party and destroying the country. People's organizations must clearly distinguish right from wrong and severely condemn the treacherous and false, so that the people can understand their crimes of colluding with bandits and flattering foreign enemies, and will not be deceived by fallacies. Third, assist in suppressing bandits to quell the rebellion. This time, during the Fujian Rebellion, Chen Mingshu and others and the bandit party concluded a non-aggression pact and provided weapons and supplies, hoping that the bandit disaster would be rampant and temporarily postpone the punishment. However, by undermining the country's years of suppression of the chaos, it further hinders the nation's solidarity and survival. Therefore, at this time, it is even more necessary to encourage the people to assist in suppressing bandits, so that the bandit flames can be cleared as soon as possible and construction can begin. Once an area is secured, the sweeping can be expected. The above three points are deeply hoped that the people's organizations at all levels will conscientiously follow them, so that the rebellious atmosphere can be cleared as soon as possible and the nation can be established. There is a strong hope." (5th)</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Aviation School Conducts Anti-Aircraft Shooting Exercise</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) The anti-aircraft artillery company of the Aviation School will conduct live-fire shooting at Babu, Haining, at 8:00 AM on the 6th. The Provincial Government has been specially telegraphed to inform the people in the nearby counties. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Lu Diping received a telegram from Liu Heding today, stating that Nie Jinlong, the commander of the 6th Regiment of the Second Security Brigade in Fujian Province, willingly joined the rebellion and assumed the position of commander of the false independent regiment. The battalion commanders of the regiment, Wei Jiankang, Jiang Xintao, and Zhong Mao, led all the officers and soldiers of the regiment to declare their secession and have now concentrated their troops in Zhenghe County to await orders. The Lieutenant Colonel regiment adjutant, Lan Yaohu, has been temporarily appointed to act as the regiment commander to maintain local political security. In addition to replying by telegram, Lu also telegraphed the border counties to inform them. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Yu Jishi received a telegram from Chen Shizheng, the director of the Fourth Security Sub-district, stating that eight or nine hundred bandits in Shouning, northern Fujian, were besieging the Banling Self-Defense Corps. A battalion of infantry and two companies were sent to their aid and encountered the bandits at Banyang. The bandits retreated towards Gongping. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Met with Yan Xishan Yesterday; In Addition to Mongolian Affairs, Discussions on the Current Situation Were Also Held</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Huang Shaoxiong met with Yan Xishan this morning and talked for two hours before leaving. In addition to Mongolian affairs, discussions on the current situation were also held. Military and political circles held a public banquet for Huang in the evening. Huang plans to go to Peiping in two or three days. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Li Songfeng returned to Beijing this morning. According to his account, the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue has come to a conclusion. Huang Shaoxiong has drafted a plan and submitted it to the central government, which will take effect after the government makes a decision. Because Jin-Sui is adjacent to Inner Mongolia, Huang went to Jin to meet with Yan Xishan to discuss the matter. He may come to Peiping in two or three days to meet with He Yingqin and Huang Fu before returning to Beijing. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Bai Rui returned to Peiping from Suiyuan last night. According to his account, De Wang stated that his personal name is not a problem, but the Silingol League is connected to Japan and Russia, and the future is extremely dangerous. Based on the current situation, it is expected that something will happen in the Silingol League in four or five months. However, Inner Mongolia lacks necessary supplies for defense. It is hoped that the central government will provide practical assistance in terms of military pay and equipment for the Mongolian army in the short term and do its best to defend the border.

<h3>Complications in Taking Over Shanhaiguan; Japanese Side Wants to Resolve it Simultaneously with the Opening of Traffic Between Peiping and Shenyang; Plans to Include Dongluocheng in the Puppet Territory's Responsibility; He Yingqin and Huang Fu Have Agreed on General Measures with Yi Wo; Tao Shangming Will Go to Shanhaiguan Again Soon to Negotiate; Yin Rugeng is Processing the Handover Procedures for Malanyu</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the Shanhaiguan handover issue, it is rumored that the Japanese side wants to resolve it simultaneously with the opening of traffic between Peiping and Shenyang. If there is no way to open traffic, the takeover of the passes along the Great Wall and the establishment of customs offices will be delayed indefinitely. According to Yin Tong, the traffic plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways but has not yet been approved, so it has not been mentioned to the Japanese side again. Due to the decrease in coal transport from Kailuan, the revenue of the Peiping-Liaoning Railway has decreased by more than 1,000 tons per day, resulting in a monthly loss of more than 200,000 yuan. However, the monthly military funds for North China can still be disbursed at 150,000 yuan. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Li Zeyi returned to Peiping from Shenyang this morning and immediately reported everything to Huang Fu. It is said that Li Zeyi went to Tokyo, Japan, to visit his sick son. He exchanged opinions with the Japanese side on Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues but had no special mission. The takeover of Shanhaiguan has been complicated by the Japanese side building barracks and developing markets in Dongluocheng. The day before yesterday, Tao Shangming and Yi Wo, the head of the Japanese intelligence agency in Shanhaiguan, came to Peiping to meet with Huang Fu and He Yingqin to discuss solutions. Yi Wo stayed in Peiping for two days before returning. A general agreement has been reached on the method of taking over Shanhaiguan, and Tao Shangming will go to Shanhaiguan again in three to five days to negotiate. The handover can be implemented once the procedures have been agreed upon. The Luanyu Administrative Commissioner's Office will be located in Tangshan, and as the office building has not yet been found, it is planned to temporarily use part of the premises of the Beining Railway.

According to Huo, the Ji-Mi Commissioner's Office will be established within ten days, and the Ji-Mi Office in Miyun may be located in Shixia Town in the future. The puppet troops and police in Gubeikou and Malanyu have been allowed by the Japanese side to withdraw.

Regarding the establishment of customs offices along the Great Wall, Zhang Yongnian, an investigator from the Ministry of Finance, has submitted a report to Peiping, stating that the inspection of Lengkou and its surrounding areas has been completed and that he is now continuing to inspect the areas around Xifengkou. There is no definite date for his return to Peiping. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Yin Rugeng will convene a meeting of the magistrates of more than ten counties under his jurisdiction when the Ji-Mi Commissioner's Office is established. After the meeting, he will depart to inspect each of the counties. Tao Shangming will go to Shanhaiguan in the coming days to meet with Endo and others to continue negotiating the takeover of Shanhaiguan. The puppet government recently sent people to Miyun to handle emergency relief and has already remitted 3,000 yuan to a certain bank in Gubeikou, and it is rumored that they plan to continue with agricultural relief. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) It was recently discovered that the tomb of Prince Qinggong in Miyun had been looted by bandits. Wei Yonghe, the commander of the Second Security Brigade, and Sun Shutang, the magistrate of Miyun County, discussed measures to maintain local security. The Japanese side plans to include Dongluocheng in the puppet territory for responsibility. The authorities telegraphed the central government for instructions. The central government recently replied, instructing Tao Shangming to continue to negotiate with Japanese military attaché Shibayama. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side has established a post office in Gubeikou, which is now officially open. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the issue of taking over Shanhaiguan, the Japanese side created additional obstacles, demanding that the Dongluocheng area be designated as a district for puppet customs, post offices, puppet police, etc., as a condition for returning Shanhaiguan. The Peiping Political Reorganization Committee fears that the Japanese's goal is to occupy the area for a long time. The day before yesterday, they telegraphed the central government for instructions from Fang Qian. The telegram stated that Dongluocheng is only four li away from Shanhaiguan. The Japanese side has now made unreasonable demands. In addition to planning to move the puppet organizations stationed in Shanhaiguan to that area, they have also begun to build markets and barracks there. Under these circumstances, our side would find it difficult to agree hastily. After a period of research, the central government recently telegraphed the authorities in Peiping, instructing them on the negotiating policy, and also instructed them to negotiate strictly with the Kwantung Army to conduct discussions on takeover methods while maintaining the principle of sovereignty. It was also stated that if the Japanese side does not insist, it is hoped that Shanhaiguan can be taken over this year. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Holds Memorial for Zhaoye Uprising; Yang Hu Submits Written Report on the Process; Ye Chucang States Personal Thoughts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a memorial meeting for the 18th anniversary of the Zhaoye Uprising at 9:00 AM on the 5th. Members of the Central Committee Ye Chucang, Wang Luyi, Chen Zhaoying, Hong Ludong, Li Zonghuang, Zheng Zhannan, Miao Peicheng, Li Jingzhai, and all staff members and representatives of various agencies, approximately 600 people, attended. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. Yang Hu did not come to Beijing due to other matters and submitted a written report, which was presented by Ye. First, he stated that the purpose of the Zhaoye Uprising was to denounce Yuan Shikai's ambition for an imperial system and to implement the Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary plan. The arrangements for the uprising were presided over by Chen Qimei, who contacted the army and navy in Shanghai to launch the uprising on December 5th. All comrades were determined to die and were extremely brave in the face of danger. Therefore, more than ten of the twenty comrades on the Zhaoye ship were martyred after the failure of the uprising. He then described the process of the Zhaoye Uprising and its results in detail. After Ye finished presenting Yang's report, he expressed his personal thoughts, saying that the heroic nature of the Zhaoye Uprising showed the difficulty of the entrepreneurship of Sun Yat-sen and the martyrs. We, as descendants, should carry forward and promote the legacy of our predecessors today, or at least preserve the foundation. At the very least, we must not forget it in our hearts. However, the rebels and others not only did not do this but also destroyed the foundation of our party. They are truly unfaithful and unfilial descendants. We should quickly eliminate these unworthy elements to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven and to extend the foundation of our party to eternity.

<h3>Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Stops Military Actions in Kang-Tibet; Tibetan People Hope to Convene Kang-Tibet Conference; Remarks of Gongjue Zhongni, Representative of the Dalai Lama</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gongjue Zhongni, the representative of the Dalai Lama, said: "The defense areas of the Kang and Tibetan armies are separated by only one river, making contact extremely easy. News reports indicate that conflicts have occurred again. Although I have not received a telegram, it is a possibility. The Dalai Lama is very sincere in his desire for peace. He has repeatedly requested the central government to resolve the situation. I have repeatedly requested the central government to promptly order a resolution. After returning to Beijing from Peiping, I will visit Chairman Shi to request a prompt resolution and to send another senior official to investigate, so as to avoid escalating the situation. Currently, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has telegraphed both sides to stop military actions and await mediation." (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Bufang, the commander of the Qinghai Border Defense Garrison, and the Dalai Lama concluded a peace treaty, agreeing not to infringe upon each other. The military conflict in Qinghai-Tibet has subsided. However, the Dalai Lama, influenced by a certain country, is taking advantage of the central government's troubles and is now militarily invading Xikang. To avoid the limitations of peace in Qinghai, they have changed to economic invasion methods and established customs offices on the Qinghai border bordering Tibet, imposing heavy taxes on all goods entering and leaving Qinghai Province, causing a great impact on Qinghai's finances. The Qinghai Border Defense Garrison Headquarters telegraphed a report on the true situation on the 4th and requested instructions. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission forwarded it to the central government, requesting that it consult with the Ministry of the General Staff and the Ministry of Finance to discuss measures to stop the situation. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gongjue Zhongni also said, "Previously, I received news from Tibet that if the Sichuan army in the Dege area of Kang continues to advance westward, the Tibetan people, for safety's sake, will request the central government to invite Britain and each send representatives to convene a Kang-Tibet conference in accordance with the methods of 1914 and 1917. At the same time, both Kang and Tibet will each send representatives to attend and conduct a concrete discussion. Since Liu Wenhui's army advanced to the northeast of the Jinsha River last year, the areas of Dege, Zhuhe, Luohe, and Weili, which were originally under the jurisdiction of Tibet, have all been occupied by Liu's army. The Tibetan army retreated to the northwest of the Jinsha River. Not long after, Liu Wenhui completely burned down the Da Jin Temple, which belongs to Dege County, and more than 5,000 lamas in the temple were expelled. Therefore, all the lamas in Tibet are dissatisfied and constantly plotting to attack Liu's army and recover the above areas. This is a fact. However, the majority of the Tibetan people advocate for a Kang-Tibet conference to seek a solution. In 1914, the Qinghai-Tibet conflict occurred, and Yuan Shikai sent Chen Yifan to convene the Shimla Conference in India, which was attended by a British representative. Another meeting was held in 1917, but it failed to achieve good results. At present, the Kang-Tibet conflict is still seeking to follow the old precedent and hold the same meeting again. In my opinion, Kang and Tibet are both Chinese territory and do not need foreign participation in the discussion. I only hope that the central government can have a good solution."

<h3>Military Commission Orders Restoration of Military Flags</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Commission previously believed that military flags had long been abolished in European and American countries.

Now, considering the many inconveniences in suppressing bandits and rebels after the abolition of military flags, the Military Commission has issued a renewed order to all units of the National Revolutionary Army to restore all military flags.

<h3>The Competition Between the Naval and Air Forces of Japan and the United States - The Situation in the Pacific After the Failure of the Disarmament Conference -</h3>
<p>The relationship between Japan and the United States has recently shown a trend of easing due to intensified economic conflicts between Britain and Japan, and tense diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Japan interprets this easing as stemming from the fact that there are few active conflicts in the economic realm between Japan and the United States and ample room for harmonization, with the exchange of cotton and raw silk being a historical source. The severity of the global economic panic has made such mutual needs even more critical. As for the United States, it is busy stabilizing its domestic economic panic and urgently seeking to open up overseas markets through peaceful means. It cannot but temporarily remain silent regarding Japan's military adventurous actions. However, can the aforementioned interests between Japan and the United States truly be harmonized, and will the deterioration of political relations not be severe? Everyone knows this is not the case. It is evidently a diplomatic maneuver by the Japanese to stabilize the morale of their people amidst their surrounded situation, hoping to reduce the obstacles they face internationally.</p>
<p>Originally, Japan's rise in the Pacific was greatly aided by Britain. Before the Russo-Japanese War, the power of Imperial Russia expanded, seeking to extend its reach into the Pacific to encompass China and dominate the seas, while also crossing the Huihui ethnic groups from Central Asia to peer into India. To protect its Eastern markets and the security of its rule over India, Britain had to prevent the excessive expansion of Imperial Russia's power. Consequently, it had no choice but to support Japan and suppress Russia. However, since the Russian Revolution, the fundamental national policy of Russia has changed. Although Britain cannot be entirely without vigilance towards it, Japan's rapid advance is even more pronounced than that of Russia in the past. The expansion of its economic power and the swelling of its naval strength have caused Britain to feel deeply uneasy in the Far Eastern markets. Therefore, Britain had to first secure its frontiers, making the area west of Hong Kong its sphere of maritime influence, with the Far Eastern markets as its vanguard and India as its base. The export of Japanese goods to India is subject to certain restrictions. Consequently, the relationship between Britain and Japan has shifted from alliance to separation and has become adversarial.</p>
<p>Japan and the Soviet Union have historically had many rifts, and their theoretical standpoints are also entirely incompatible. However, there is still room for maneuver in international relations. However, after Japan provoked the September 18th Incident, its relations with the Soviet Union have worsened. The infringement of the Soviet Union's acquired rights in northern Manchuria is not limited to the Chinese Eastern Railway alone. Vladivostok is at risk of being invaded, and Baikal cannot avoid being controlled from the flanks. At the same time, Japan is also the continental military power in East Asia, and its traditional hypothetical enemy is the Soviet Union. The differences between the two countries in political and economic standpoints have evolved into serious military preparedness. Given an opportunity, there is the potential for explosion.</p>
<p>Amidst the exposure of this crisis, the relationship between Japan and the United States is merely a shift in a portion of public opinion, while the United States and the Soviet Union are accelerating the restoration of diplomatic relations. Although the restoration focuses on economics, it will also have a significant impact politically, especially on the current situation in the Far East. Therefore, Japan has repeatedly changed its second supplementary naval shipbuilding plan to construct two aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and destroyers and submarines within the limits of the London Treaty, with a total of 23 vessels to be built. In addition, there are 26 transport ships and repair ships outside the limits. The air force has also suddenly increased by eight squadrons. Although its naval shipbuilding budget has been reduced to 450 million Japanese yen, it still retains the addition of future budgets. Can such a large-scale expansion of warships fail to alarm the United States and alert Britain?</p>
<p>The forward military bases of the United States in the Far East are Guam and Manila. The naval base of the United States on the Pacific coast is more than 2,000 nautical miles from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Pearl Harbor is more than 3,300 nautical miles from Guam. Manila is also over 1,500 nautical miles from Guam. Even connecting the Aleutian Islands with the naval port near Bremerton-Seattle is not easy. Japan's forward base, Penghu Island in the Taiwan Strait, is only 600 miles from Manila and only 1,500 nautical miles from Japan itself. Therefore, Japan's defense is very easy, and it is not too difficult to advance on Guam and peer into the Philippines. Moreover, the sea route from Okinawa to Guam is only 850 nautical miles. Japan's forward naval base in the Pacific, Ogasawara Island, is only 550 nautical miles from Yokosuka. Its operations are flexible, and its actions are swift, far beyond what the United States can achieve. Recently, it has also been working hard to expand its naval air force. Although its military strength is not as great as that of the United States, it has more than enough for defense, and it is not difficult to invade American territories. Furthermore, with the rapid movement and violent explosive power of the air force, the ability of the United States to defend the Philippines is ultimately difficult to ensure stability. Given the immense threat felt towards the development of Far Eastern markets, the competition between the naval and air forces of Japan and the United States will become turbulent waves in the Pacific in the future, and will not stop until it triggers a final war.</p>
<h3>Roman Talks Conclude, Russian Foreign Minister Issues Declaration, Reiterating Desire to Maintain Peace, Denouncing Disarmament Conference as a Mere Corpse, Remaining Silent on Far East Discussions, Not Discussing Reform of the League of Nations, Religious Policy Unchanged, Litvinov Leaves Rome for Berlin Last Night, Denying Possibility of Russo-German Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>Rome - Today, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov issued a lengthy statement to the press, strongly asserting Russia's desire to maintain peace with its neighbors, and stating that in the past ten years, there has never been a discussion of friendly relations between Italy and Russia like today's. The recognition of Soviet Russia by the United States has not changed the existing relations between Italy and Russia. This afternoon, Litvinov attended a farewell banquet hosted by American Ambassador Lang, accompanied by key members of the American and Russian embassies. In the evening, Mr. Litvinov attended a farewell banquet hosted by the Turkish ambassador. At 9:30 tonight, the Soviet Russian Foreign Minister will depart for Berlin to meet with the first American Ambassador to Russia, Bullitt, there. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome - Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov told guests today, regarding the results of his trip, that he had frank talks with American President Roosevelt, Italian leader Mussolini, French Foreign Minister Poncet, and German Foreign Minister Neurath. Before returning to Russia, he will see the German Foreign Minister again. He denounced the disarmament conference as a corpse, which is entirely reasonable, as some countries are preparing for war. To speak of disarmament at this time is simply a waste of time. As for the reorganization of the League of Nations and the issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations, it has not been discussed. He also had no contact with the Roman Catholic Church, as Soviet Russia's religious policy has not changed. Russia still prohibits religious propaganda. Litvinov acknowledged that he had discussed the Far East issue but did not wish to elaborate. He also denied the possibility of a Russo-German non-aggression treaty. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Emphasis on Enhancing German-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>Rome - Tonight, Prime Minister Mussolini will attend a banquet at the Russian embassy, where both sides will continue negotiations. It is now widely rumored that the Russian Foreign Minister has met with the German Ambassador, but this claim is difficult to prove. Assuming it did happen, the meeting must have been extremely secret. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) - British newspaper reporters reported on Russian Commissioner Litvinov's trip to Italy, stating that Mr. Litvinov and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's talks focused heavily on enhancing German-Russian relations. There is a possibility of Soviet Russia joining the Four-Power Pact. Daily Telegraph reporters also stated that they are now certain that the Italian Prime Minister aims to finalize a Russo-German non-aggression agreement. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Rumors of a Trip to Vienna</h3>
<p>Vienna - The "Neue Freie Presse" reports that, according to reliable sources, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov will come to Vienna from Rome tomorrow (Wednesday). (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russia and Italy Discuss Religious Issues, American Postmaster General Will Serve as Intermediary</h3>
<p>Rome - Litvinov toured the suburbs today. American Postmaster General Farley, who came from New York, is still here engaging in diplomatic activities. Mr. Farley met with the Pope and his Secretary of State today, and will pay a visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini tomorrow. As one of the leaders of American Catholicism, he is here to explain the religious freedom issue for Americans in Russia under the Russo-American agreement. He will likely serve as an intermediary in negotiations between Litvinov, the Holy See, and the Italian government, as the Holy See cannot directly negotiate with the Russian Foreign Minister because Soviet Russia is an anti-Christian nation. If the Holy See can indirectly persuade Russia to allow people of all countries to enjoy religious freedom within Russia, the Holy See will recognize the Russian government. In this case, the relations between Soviet Russia and Catholic countries will become closer, especially with Poland. (4th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italy Opposes German-Austrian Union</h3>
<p>Vienna - Newspapers have much coverage of the Spanish election events and Litvinov's trip to Rome. News from Rome states that Italian authorities have declared that Italy will oppose the German-Austrian union in any case. The newspapers of Vienna do not criticize this news, as Italy's determination to maintain Austria's political independence is already known to the world and need not be elaborated upon. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Hosts Banquet for German Ambassador</h3>
<p>(Moscow) - The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the new German Ambassador, Nadolny. Mr. Nadolny said during the banquet that his main purpose is to make the relations between the two countries closer. He believes that his ability to act will be able to cope with the true spirit of cooperation between the two countries. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Conflicting Impressions from Various Parties</h3>
<p>Rome - The press is commenting on the communique released after the meeting between Litvinov and Mussolini, saying that although the detailed circumstances of the talks are unknown, the two men seem to have discussed disarmament, the Danube River issue, and the Far East issue, and intend to consider them outside the League of Nations, using methods that all other powers can recognize. One phrase in the communique has been emphasized by various newspapers, namely, "Litvinov and Mussolini believe that the general political situation can be improved in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty of Friendship between Italy and Soviet Russia." "La Stampa" stated that there are several major issues to be resolved outside the League of Nations, such as the relations between Soviet Russia, Germany, and Japan, which are unrelated to Geneva because the three countries are not members of the League of Nations. "Il Giornale d'Italia" stated that there are various issues related to all countries, whose scope extends beyond the territory of Europe. Since the meeting between the Soviet Russian Foreign Minister and the Italian Prime Minister, international relations have been clarified, and these issues related to the overall situation are easier to resolve. In short, the comments made by various newspapers on the talks between the representatives of Italy and Russia are not very clear and are mutually contradictory. Considering this, the representatives of Italy and Russia merely conducted a general discussion of the international political situation, without seeing any specific decisions. It is also unlikely that there will be any changes in the diplomatic policies of the two countries. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian Warship Visit to Italy Well-Received, Moscow Sends Telegram of Thanks</h3>
<p>Rome - The Soviet fleet traveled to Turkey and detoured to the port of Naples in Italy, where it received a warm welcome from Italy.

I am deeply grateful." (4th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italy and France Seek Economic Understanding</h3>

<h3>Meeting Between American and Russian Ambassadors in Paris</h3>

This is the first time that the American and Russian embassies in Paris have directly contacted each other since the establishment of the Soviet Russian government. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Litvinov-Mussolini Talks Involve the Far East, Economic Boycott Seals Japan's Fate</h3>
<p>Rome - Soviet Russia has signed non-aggression treaties with its Western neighbors and recently restored Russo-American relations. Its diplomatic relations are proceeding smoothly. Now, only the Far Eastern diplomacy with Japan as the opponent has not been resolved. During the first meeting between Litvinov and Mussolini, Li discussed the Far East issue, saying that Soviet Russia must pay attention to Japan's recent continental policy. The two exchanged various opinions on the policy towards Japan. Although Litvinov expressed his opinions on Japanese imperialism, Mussolini only pointed out the issue of Japanese goods entering the world market and did not actively express opinions on Japan. However, newspapers in Rome have recently carried reports of the threat of Japanese goods to the European economy, advocating that all countries unite to boycott Japanese goods. (4th Rengo Telegram)</p>
<h3>Famous Italian Reporter Advocates Improving Russian-Italian Business Relations</h3>
<p>Rome - Famous Italian reporter Anglai published an article in the newspaper today, advocating that the Russian side automatically reduce the amount of wood transported into Italy, so that Italy can purchase wood from Austria, thereby promoting economic relations between Italy and Austria. In the first eight months of this year, the goods that Italy shipped to Russia were worth 11 million rubles, but the Russian goods imported by Italy were worth 15 million rubles. Therefore, Italy urgently wants to correct the trade deficit. Anglai also believes that the conclusion of a friendship and non-aggression agreement between Italy and Russia may open a new era in European policy, because in this way, countries can be connected with each other through similar bilateral treaties to replace the multilateral agreements of the League of Nations. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Movement for Small Entente Countries to Recognize Soviet Russia Gains Momentum</h3>
<p>Prague - The movement to establish normal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia is gaining momentum.

The Economic Committee of the Upper House passed a motion urging the government to conduct negotiations for the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. A few days ago, Minister of Justice Mestan publicly declared his support for the recognition of the Soviet Union. "Demokratis Treat" reported that in the near future, the Small Entente countries will conduct a concerted movement to establish normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

<h3>Results of the Spanish Parliamentary Elections - Right Wing Fails to Occupy Absolute Majority - Central Parties Hold Decisive Influence - General Strike Wave Occurs in Coria</h3>
<p>Madrid - The results of the Spanish parliamentary elections have now been announced by the government as follows: Right wing 207, Central 167, Left wing 99 (including the Socialist Party). Although the victory of the Madrid Socialist Party has slightly moderated the radicals, the situation in the province of Barcelona is very tense. The governor has ordered the transport strikers to resume work tonight, otherwise they will be dismissed. The national situation is still extremely precarious. The government is concerned about the rebellion of rioters. All newspapers must submit sample copies to the censorship office one hour before publication. News of strikes has been mostly deleted. One newspaper has been seized. It is extremely difficult for radical leader Lerroux to form a cabinet, as Azaña now wants to force the president to dissolve the new parliament, believing that this parliament is not suitable for the current political system. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid - A revolutionary general strike has been declared in Coria, 200 miles from the capital. Telephone and telegraph lines have been cut off. A large number of police officers are rushing to the area. The Governor of Barcelona's sad letter to the strikers will expire tonight. There are fears of major riots in the area. All passenger and transportation matters in the city are now under the control of the provincial governor. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Indo-Japanese Conference Again on the Verge of Collapse - Indian Final Reply Has Strong Stance - Japanese Representative Very Embarrassed, Preparing to Return Home</h3>
<p>New Delhi - The Indian delegation today sent a detailed reply to the Japanese delegation. The Indo-Japanese negotiations have reached the final stage. It is heard that the Indian government has made some concessions, but maintains a firm stance, stating that if Japan does not accept this method, the negotiations will end without result. The Japanese delegation stated that it now needs to consult Tokyo. However, the Indian government is now preparing for the Japanese government to accept the actions after this final method. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>New Delhi - At the 14th meeting of the Indo-Japanese negotiations, the content of the new proposal put forward by the Indian representative was very different from the final proposal of the Japanese delegation. Japanese Representative Sawada stated that this new proposal leaves no room for consideration by Japan. Representative Sawada telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last night for instructions. The Japanese Cotton Industry Delegation believes that the negotiations have reached the point of collapse and is preparing to return home. (4th Rengo Telegram)</p>
<h3>Indian Final Answer</h3>
<p>Osaka - According to the telegram received by the Textile Federation from the Delhi Delegation at 8:00 PM on the 4th, the content of the answer submitted by the Indian side at the 14th Main Conference between Japan and India on the 4th consists of the following two items: (1) Cotton cloth is divided into four types, and the ratio is revised as follows: Unprocessed cotton cloth 41%, Unprocessed printed cotton cloth 12%, Bleached cotton cloth 12%, Processed cotton cloth 32%. (2) The overall allocation ratio of the four types proposed by Japan is acknowledged as 10% flexible, but this 10% is allocated to more than two types. When the flexibility is in one type, it is 4%. According to this second alternative, all types are still in accordance with the Indian proposal of 45% for unprocessed, 13% for printed, 8% for bleached, and 34% for processed. The flexibility for one type is 4%. As a result, bleached cotton cloth is still the same as the first proposal, at 12%, which is very different from the Japanese final proposal of 18% for bleached cotton cloth. Representative Sawada telegraphed the Textile Federation for instructions. The Textile Federation, the Export Cotton Yarn and Cloth Association, and the Japanese Cotton Association will hold a joint special committee at noon on the 5th to study countermeasures.

<h3>Japan Cannot Acknowledge</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - Regarding the Indian response to the Indo-Japanese consultations yesterday, the Foreign Ministry authorities told reporters that they have not yet received an official telegram. If the content of the Indian response is as rumored, then India's sincerity is questionable and unexpected. Once the official telegram is received, the opinions of the parties concerned will be heard. If the response is as rumored, it is too far from Japan's final proposal and cannot be acknowledged. The future of the conference is of great concern. Japan hopes that India will recognize Japan's position and respond with a response that has been given considerable consideration. The result is regrettable. (5th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>New Delhi - The 14th Main Conference of the Indo-Japanese consultations, which received the final response from the Indian side, opened at 11:00 AM on the 4th. Representative Buya gave a comprehensive and detailed response to the maximum concession proposed by Japan. The content of the response only perfunctorily expressed a few concessions and was substantially equivalent to rejecting the Japanese proposal. It is the worst response for Japan and cannot be acknowledged. Representative Sawada believed that it was necessary to seek instructions from the home country and avoided immediate response. The meeting ended in 30 minutes. The situation is increasingly urgent. Japan has decided to support the previous final proposal. There is only a breakdown in the negotiations. In short, the fate of the Indo-Japanese consultations depends on how the Japanese side takes action in the future. (5th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>Osaka - In order to discuss the measures for the response proposed by the Indian side at the 14th Indo-Japanese Main Conference on the 4th, the three groups of the Textile Federation, the Export Cotton Yarn and Cloth Association, and the Cotton Association will hold a joint committee at the Cotton Industry Club at noon today after receiving a detailed report from Representative Kurata. However, the Indian response is very different from Japan's maximum concession proposal, and there is dissatisfaction with everything. The parties concerned have a strong attitude of adhering to Japan's final proposal and rejecting the Indian proposal. Before the meeting of the committee, Textile Federation Chairman Abe Fusajiro told reporters that India's response could not be acknowledged and that Japan's proposal of 18% bleached cotton cloth ratio should be adhered to from beginning to end.

<h3>Hirota Already Concerned About Japan's Economic Aggression - Attaches Importance to the Trend of Various Countries Rejecting Japanese Goods - Instructs Envoys to Mitigate Anti-Japanese Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini seemed to have discussed the Far East policy with Soviet Russian representative Litvinov who came to Italy, and also discussed the entry and exit of Japanese goods. At the same time, the news in France and Italy is worried about the Japanese goods nibbling on the Ethiopian market, saying that Italy may consider resisting the dumping of Japanese goods. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry authorities attached great importance to the trend of various countries preventing Japanese trade and immediately telegraphed the resident officials, instructing them to mitigate the anti-Japanese public opinion. In addition, Foreign Minister Hirota also reported to the cabinet meeting today and discussed countermeasures. (1st Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Conference Discusses Economic Issues; U.S. Yet to Clearly State Position</h3>
<p>Although Washington has declared that the U.S. delegation does not want to discuss tariffs or currency stabilization at the Montevideo Pan-American Conference, current indications are that these two issues, along with other important economic matters, will likely become the main topics of the conference. During today's main committee meeting, Mexican Foreign Minister Caso Rangel began a general debate on economic issues, discussing matters such as debt, silver, and currency. Many other representatives also believe that these issues should all be brought up for consideration at the conference. The conference agenda will be decided at tomorrow's main committee meeting, and it is anticipated that the Latin American republics, under the leadership of Caso Rangel, will strongly push for their inclusion. However, whether the United States will actively oppose this remains unclear. Besides the aforementioned declaration from Washington when the U.S. delegation departed, there has been no explicit rejection of discussing tariffs and currency issues. Even the head of the U.S. delegation, Secretary of State Hull, has remained silent on his government's stance. Many other Latin American representatives regard these two issues as vital to their own interests. Latin America has long fiercely criticized U.S. tariff policies. Argentina, in particular, whose beef, leather, and other products have effectively been excluded from the U.S. market, is expected to strongly demand significant modifications to certain U.S. tax rates this time. In today's speech, Caso Rangel emphasized the necessity of reforming commercial relations among the Americas, arguing that such relations should be built on a solid commercial foundation. He stated, "If our several countries wish to have satisfactory commercial relations, they can only be based on genuine mutual benefit. While the development of transportation and bilateral or multilateral agreements are also helpful, what we need most is for the former spiritual friendship or shared history between us to be transformed into genuine economic interests. We live in an era where only by exchanging goods and services with each other can we hope to create an effective economic union." Subsequently, upon a motion by U.S. delegation head Hull, the main committee unanimously elected Uruguayan Foreign Minister Mañé as the permanent chairman of the conference. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Montevideo: It is reported that the majority of delegates attending the Pan-American Conference strongly support including silver on the agenda. The Mexican delegation is actively promoting its proposed seven-point monetary and economic plan, in which silver plays a significant role. Mexican Foreign Minister Caso Rangel has disclosed the following details:</p>
<p>(1) All North and South American countries should adopt a bimetallic standard and stabilize the price of silver.</p>
<p>(2) Monetary policy should be based on the domestic price level.</p>
<p>(3) Central banks should be standardized.</p>
<p>(4) An American International Clearing House should be established to reduce unnecessary gold flows.</p>
<p>(5) Silver should be included in central bank reserves.</p>
<p>(6) Currency markets should be controlled.</p>
<p>(7) Credit mediums should be standardized.</p>
<p>Experts here say that if adopted, the Mexican plan could greatly increase the purchasing power of China, India, and other countries holding large quantities of silver, while also consolidating the position of gold standard countries. According to the Mexican Foreign Minister, this proposal is not unique to Mexico; many other representatives are also preparing to add new topics to the economic portion of the agenda.

<h3>Pan-European Economic Conference Forms Permanent Council; Dutch Delegate Expresses Views on Bimetallism</h3>
<p>Vienna: Today marked the final day of the Pan-European Economic Conference. A permanent council has been formed. Sir Henri Deterding, Director-General of Royal Dutch Shell, stated in his report on bimetallism that to avoid monetary panic, private individuals should not hold gold; it should only be held by central banks. He endorsed the theories of Gilbart, believing that paper money is superior to silver coins, but he considered hard currency better than Soviet paper money. European central banks should have banknotes backed by silver. He also felt that a unified gold standard was impossible. Deterding did not say that the best thing to do was to close universities that study higher economics, and to instead have more schools that focused on appropriate vocations. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Tariff Dispute: Anglo-French Negotiations at an Impasse; France Demands Amendment to Commercial Treaty as Condition for Removing Additional Tax</h3>
<p>(London): According to various morning newspapers, negotiations between Britain and France regarding the removal of the 15% additional tax levied by France on British goods appear to have reached an impasse again. It is reported that France is demanding an amendment to the Anglo-French Commercial Treaty as a condition for its removal. The French ambassador to Britain has requested the immediate commencement of negotiations for a new agreement. The British cabinet is divided on its approach to the situation, but a tariff war between the two countries is unlikely. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Strict Regulations on Opium in Singapore; Government Monopoly on Opium Sales; Smokers Must Register</h3>
<p>Singapore: The Straits Settlements government has implemented stricter new regulations concerning the sale of opium paste and the registration of opium smokers in order to purchase opium. As a result, many upper-class Chinese in Singapore have entered Chinese-run opium cessation hospitals in order to quit the habit and avoid humiliation when buying opium. One of the new regulations requires smokers, except those physically unable to leave their homes for special reasons, to purchase opium directly from government outlets. The opium purchase permit includes a photograph of the individual and specifies their daily opium consumption, place of birth, earning capacity, current address, and the location where they intend to smoke the purchased opium.

<h3>Southern Ireland's Independence Movement; British Government Prepares Response, Declaring Loss of Privileges</h3>
<p>(London): Éamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, has requested the British government to clarify its attitude towards Southern Ireland's declaration of a republic. The British cabinet committee has drafted a response, clearly stating that if the Free State secedes from the British Empire, it will naturally forfeit the privileges it enjoys as a member of the Empire. This decision is highly significant, as the committee comprises Prime Minister MacDonald, Dominions Secretary Thomas, Foreign Secretary Simon, and War Secretary Hailsham. The content of the response, to be disclosed in both houses of Parliament tomorrow, essentially states that Britain desires friendly relations with the Free State and has no intention of coercion. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(London): Dominions Secretary Thomas stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Irish situation that the British government does not believe the Irish Free State will definitively repudiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and therefore cannot declare its attitude. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>French Financial Bill; Public Debate in Parliament Tomorrow; Fate of Chautemps Cabinet Hangs in the Balance</h3>
<p>(Paris): The Chamber of Deputies' Finance Committee is currently busy amending the government's financial bill. With the exception of a bond lottery in 1934, virtually every clause is being revised. The Socialists' opposition to the reduction of civil servants' salaries is intensifying. Securities market insiders widely believe that the government has little hope of winning the debate in the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris): After listening to the Budget Minister's explanation of Article 12 of the budget bill (regarding the re-taxation of civil servants' salaries), the rapporteur, Jacques, declared that he believed the clause should be passed in its entirety and requested the committee to vote only on its approval or rejection without amendment. The vote resulted in 19 votes for and 19 votes against, and Jacques' motion was not adopted. Subsequently, the various amendments were put to a vote, and two were rejected. The committee asked the chairman to inform the government that it should thoroughly explain all reasons to the Chamber of Deputies before the public debate. After discussion, the committee passed Article 12 by 19 votes to 17, with two abstentions. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3>The United States Lifts Prohibition Starting Today; Nation Prepares for Unrestrained Drinking</h3>
<p>(Washington): As the entire United States prepares to celebrate the lifting of Prohibition tomorrow, news suddenly arrived from Utah that the state's National Assembly may not be able to pass the lifting of Prohibition and approve the twenty-first new amendment before 7 PM. Therefore, the nationwide lifting of Prohibition is likely to be delayed until Wednesday. However, hotels, restaurants, bars, and nightclubs all hope that Prohibition will be lifted tomorrow night. Reservations for planned banquets have been fully booked for weeks. At this time, the U.S. President has signed the brewing industry regulations and indicated that import wine tonnage permits will be ready for issuance tomorrow.

<h3>Antarctic Scientific Expedition</h3>
<p>Dunedin (New Zealand): In the coming months, two expeditions will attempt to uncover the mysteries of the Antarctic continent. The first expedition departed from here this morning by ship, bound for Whale Bay, where it will spend three to four weeks making final preparations before heading to the Southern Ocean. The leader of the expedition is Lieutenant Colonel Ellsworth, and the crew includes Norwegian pilot Bernt Balchen, who previously flew over Antarctica with Byrd. The expedition's goal is to fly completely over the Antarctic continent, taking aerial photographs of the terrain and setting a new record in exploration. It is scheduled to be completed and return by February of next year. The other expedition, led by Rear Admiral Byrd, will arrive here soon and will also head to the Antarctic continent. However, Byrd's expedition will focus on scientific measurements and will remain for two years, differing slightly in nature from Ellsworth's, which emphasizes discovery and exploration.

<h3>Executive Yuan Interprets Ambiguities in Regulations on Church Land Leases</h3>
<p>(Nanjing): The Executive Yuan, upon submission by Lu Bohong, has requested clarification of ambiguities in Articles 1 and 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Land and House Leases by Foreign Churches in the Interior. After review by the Ministry of Interior, the following interpretation is provided: "The Provisional Regulations on Land and House Leases by Foreign Churches in the Interior were originally intended to protect sovereignty and prevent foreigners from purchasing land. If the 'National Catholic Association of China', the responsible party, and the participating believers are indeed citizens of the Republic of China and have been confirmed by the Central or local senior party headquarters as a national religious body, then they are not subject to the restrictions of Articles 1 and 3 of the Provisional Regulations. However, if foreign believers falsely claim Chinese citizenship and purchase land within the association, the local government should strictly crack down to protect sovereignty." The Yuan will distribute this to the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs and order the provincial and municipal governments to take note. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Nanjing Municipal Government Expedites Procedures for Receiving Funds from the Netherlands</h3>

However, it is heard that Chairman Chiang, considering the post-war recovery in bandit-controlled areas and the need for reorganization, as well as the fact that there are already too many soldiers, finds it difficult to implement the national conscription system immediately. Furthermore, the draft implementation details prepared by the Ministries of Military Administration and General Staff require further detailed consideration.

<h3>The Disaster of Two Leaders of the Jilin Volunteer Army: Sun Chaoyang Arrested, Fu Dianchen Killed in Battle</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Northeast Volunteer Army has been fighting desperately against the Japanese and puppet troops in recent years without support or supplies, and has suffered heavy casualties. Recently, there has been news that two leaders, Sun Chaoyang and Fu Dianchen, have been arrested and killed in battle, respectively. The details of their situations are recorded as follows, in the hope that the people of the country will hear of it and rise up.</p>
<h3>Sun Chaoyang</h3>
<p>Sun's name is Xingzhou, from Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, about thirty years old. Before the Incident, he was disheartened by national affairs and took his wife and children to do business in Acheng, Jilin. He was clever and his business thrived. After the September 18th Incident, he was saddened by the invasion of the violent Japanese and rose up to raise the banner, gathering thousands of comrades to conduct guerrilla warfare between Harbin and Bin County. He repeatedly defeated the Japanese and puppet military police, and his prestige shook for a time. He also frequently dispatched comrades to form special agent groups, sneaking into Harbin to kidnap the families of puppet officials and wealthy Japanese and Korean residents, and using the funds to supplement military supplies. Together with the volunteer armies of Chen Zongdai, Fu Dianchen, Song Guorong, Mao Zuobin and others, they were regarded as a major threat by the Japanese and puppet authorities, and this time, they deployed 50,000 troops to clear and suppress them in separate areas. Since the start of the attack, the volunteer armies in Jilin have suffered greatly under pressure. Although they have all maintained their unyielding spirit and resisted repeatedly, they have been unable to provide supplies and have limited ammunition. In addition, the high-pressure power of the Japanese Air Force has made it impossible for the various units to communicate and support each other, and casualties have been extremely heavy. Under these circumstances, Sun had no choice but to lead his troops to retreat into the eastern mountains to lie in wait for an opportunity. He himself, accompanied by a staff officer, disguised themselves as farmers and planned to come to Beiping to ask for instructions from a certain national salvation organization. Unfortunately, at about 2:00 AM on October 24, in the seventh carriage of the eleventh small-ticket train from Harbin to Changchun, he was discovered by Guo, a secret agent of the Harbin Mobile Police Team. Because his eyes were bright and his spirit was excellent, he looked like someone who had been in the military for a long time, and not like a farmer. They began to investigate and question him, monitoring his actions. When the train arrived at Guxiangtun Station, Guo led several road police officers to force him off the train and detain him in the Zhanlu police station, and telegraphed the Mobile Police Headquarters. Zhang Shuping, the first section chief of the headquarters, led a squad of police officers in two police cars to Gujiatun Station to escort him back to the headquarters. The headquarters chief, Yu Jinghuan, personally interrogated him strictly. Sun initially falsely claimed to be a farmer from Zhuhe County, but after the team took out a photo for comparison, he generously admitted that he was Sun Chaoyang himself. He planned to go to Beiping to ask a certain national salvation group for instructions. Currently, there are still more than 2,000 people under his command, led by trusted personnel, lying dormant in the eastern mountains. Now, he has been unfortunately arrested, and his ambitions have not been fulfilled. Such is his fate, and he only asks to die quickly. Upon receiving the confession, the team telegraphed the Japanese and puppet military authorities. The captain of the Japanese garrison brigade in Harbin and the captain of the Fu Jiadian gendarmerie were very concerned and wanted to take him to their team for interrogation. After some negotiation, the gendarmerie took him for interrogation. It is reported that Sun's troops have received news of Sun's arrest, and more than 30 loyal members of his troops have formed a suicide squad to enter Harbin to try to rescue Sun and return him to the team. At the same time, they are negotiating with the puppet rewards bureau to exchange Sun for the Japanese kidnapped by Sun's troops earlier. If they do not agree, they will kidnap more important Japanese and Manchurian officials in exchange.</p>
<h3>Fu Dianchen</h3>
<p>Since raising the banner of righteousness, Fu has led his troops to roam between Yitong, Shuangyang, and Panshi counties in Jilin Province, repeatedly destroying the Jihai railway line, exhausting the Japanese and puppet military police. This time, when the Japanese and puppet troops decided to launch a large-scale attack, Fu led his troops to retreat to the Laoye Ridge area, where they were surrounded by more than 10,000 Japanese and puppet troops. After several days of clashes, they were unable to escape, and the air force bombings caused heavy casualties. He then ordered his troops to surrender temporarily to resolve this crisis. He and three trusted aides left the team to avoid danger temporarily. Unexpectedly, they encountered puppet troops on the road and engaged in a fierce firefight. In the end, due to the disparity in strength, he died on the battlefield. It is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>Zunhua After the War: 70-80% of Shops Closed, An Increasing Number of Vagrants Disturb the People</h3>
<p>Zunhua Correspondence: Since the Incident, bandits have been rampant in this county, and robberies have occurred repeatedly in the county seat. The people have become frightened birds. In addition, affected by the war, businesses are sluggish and the market is cold, which has never happened in previous years. According to recent statistics, 70-80% of the shops in the county have closed down. There are few pedestrians on the streets every day, and even fewer shoppers. The poverty of the people and the merchants is evident. Many people are forced to take risks out of desperation, leading to an increase in bandits. Those who are law-abiding freeze and starve to death. In addition, because the county seat is closer to the Great Wall, Japanese and Korean vagrants have been seeking to establish foreign firms due to the geographical location, specializing in selling drugs and guns, and colluding with ruffians to commit illegal acts. The people are adding fuel to the fire and crying out in pain, hoping that the authorities will provide relief. Also, because of the increasing number of bandits, the county authorities announced martial law immediately after the takeover to prevent any eventuality and to secure the area. Recently, in order to further prevent bandits, pedestrians are cut off at 8:00 PM every night. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Tight Defense of Chaoshan: Zhang Ruigui Will Serve as Chaoshan Garrison Commander, All Counties Rush to Build Roads, Trenches, and Airfields</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has drawn troops from Fujian to deploy a tight defense along the border. Chaoshan is close to Fujian Province and is also very important. Therefore, Chen Jitang has again ordered Zhang Ruigui's division to be responsible for the defense of Chao'an, Raoping, and the coastal areas of Chaoshan, and will appoint Zhang as the Chaoshan Garrison Commander or Fortress Commander. The Shantou urban area is still garrisoned by Zhang Wentao's Independent Third Regiment. The guard teams of Jieyang, Puning, and Chaoyang counties will be reorganized into training regiments, with He Baoshu as the commander. The roads in Chaozhou and Meizhou counties are being rushed to be repaired, and all bridges, culverts, and stone work must be completed within 20 days to accommodate large vehicles. Chen Jitang has purchased 30 large vehicles from Hong Kong for military transport. In terms of the air force, Huang Guangrui has dispatched the Second Squadron to Meixian County to cooperate with Wu Wenjian's Fifth Squadron to conduct daily reconnaissance flights on the Fujian-Jiangxi border. Jiaoling, Dapu, Pingyuan, Raoping, and Fengshun all have extremely large defensive works. The Hulu Mountain outside the North Gate of Chao'an City and the Pen Holder Mountain across the river have been selecting construction workers in Shantou for days to rush to build new-style artillery forts and trenches. The trench forts attached to Fengshun County City started construction three months ago and cost more than 200,000 yuan in iron ash. Now, they are rushing to build day and night to complete them within 10 days and are conscripting workers from the people, paying each person 1.5 cents per day. The largest airfield in Xingning County is also rushing to be built, starting on the 23rd, with a circumference of two li, and the location surrounds the middle of the Diaofang Dam, which can accommodate hundreds of aircraft for takeoff and landing. Li Yangjing, the commander of the Third Army, inspected the East River on the 26th, passing through Huizhou, Zijin, and Wuhua to Meixian, presiding over military affairs. It is heard that Li will be in the upper reaches of the Han River between Zijin and Fengshun, coordinating military operations against Fujian and temporarily adopting a strict defensive posture.

<h3>Hankou Citizens' Assembly - Passing a Resolution to Condemn the Chen-Li Case -</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hankou citizens' assembly was held at 9:00 AM on the 4th in the New Market to discuss and condemn the rebellion. More than 20,000 people attended. Before the meeting, leaflets were distributed, and after the meeting, a motorcade paraded through the city. The atmosphere was very tense. The assembly elected Wu Shaoshu as the general chairman, and Chen Guangzu and Wu Guozhen gave speeches. Seven motions were passed on the spot: (1) Telegraphing the Central Government, requesting the National Government to issue a clear order to condemn the rebellion in order to curb chaos and stabilize the Party and the country. (2) Telegraphing the whole country to unanimously urge the government to declare the rebellion. (3) Warning the 19th Route Army to automatically return to the right path and eliminate the puppet organization, otherwise they will cut themselves off from the Party and the country, and be abandoned by the people. (4) Telegraphing the Central National Government to strictly order the authorities in each province and city to prevent the activities of reactionary elements. (5) Telegraphing the Central Executive Committee members in various places to enter Beijing as soon as possible and jointly discuss the elimination of the Min rebels. (6) Telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the name of the assembly to declare the truth about the rebellion in Min Province to various countries and deny all its external relations. (7) Telegraphing the generals and soldiers of the whole country, for the handling of the Min Incident, should adhere to the Central Government's intention and work for the Party and the country. The text of the assembly's telegram to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang is recorded as follows: "This time, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others seized the border areas, colluded with bandits and served as enemies, changed the era name, rebelled against the Party and harmed the country. Their rebellious actions are obvious. All the people of the country deeply hate them. In recent years, the Communist bandits have been rampant, the red flames have been rampant, the villages have been in ruins, the fields have been covered with thorns, the people's livelihood has been devastated, and foreign aggression has occurred repeatedly. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang, with his mandate in the central hub, has made remarkable achievements in the prompt encirclement. The recent military campaign to suppress bandits in Jiangxi and the various routes in the northwest have made significant progress. The rebels have taken the opportunity to create chaos, colluded with bandits, opened one side of the encirclement net, and undermined the encirclement plan that was about to succeed. The crimes of Chen and Li are too numerous to mention. We hope that the Central Committee will make a grand plan and order the National Government to launch a crusade immediately and eliminate them on a set day. The 800,000 people of Hankou will unite and rise up to pledge their support. We respectfully report this by telegram, hoping you will take it into consideration." The telegram to the 19th Route Army reads: "The country is unfortunate, and disasters are frequent. In recent years, the Red bandits have been rampant, and the people have no food. Foreign enemies are rampant, and the rivers and mountains have changed color. At this time of impending doom, the people have long been tired of chaos. However, Chen Mingshu and others have disregarded the great wrong, advocated chaos in Minyuan, allied with bandits, betrayed the Party, established an organization, and changed the era name, committing heinous crimes that are resented by gods and humans. The generals and soldiers have blindly followed and acted blindly, abandoning a glorious history and leaving behind a curse for ten thousand years. There is no greater folly than the folly of man. The citizens of this city, indignant at the perverse actions of Chen Mingshu and others, held a citizens' assembly to condemn the rebellion today to show their common hatred. We hope that you will awaken and repent, arrest the leading criminals and offer them to the Central Government, and disband the puppet organization in order to set things right. Otherwise, you will harm yourself and the country. The 800,000 people of Hankou will perish together with you. This is telegraphed to you, hoping you will understand." (4th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Extortion Criminal Implicates Teahouse Worker</h3>
<p>Someone surnamed in the Hengshan area has some savings and can live without worry. Earlier this month, they suddenly received a threatening letter in the name of the Communist Party. The letter was full of threats, demanding a huge sum of more than 1,000 yuan, and stipulated that the money should be prepared on the 3rd of this month and handed over to someone who would come to collect it from the boat that travels from Hengshan to Song. When the boat arrives, someone will come to collect it. Someone secretly reported this to the County Public Security Bureau. Director Shen immediately sent two secret agents disguised as a monk and a temple servant to Hengshan. They took the boat back to Song on the appointed date. The person surnamed prepared a bundle of paper that looked like banknotes. The name of the recipient was marked on the outside. That morning, a traveler came to the Xiesheng Hotel to stay. He sent the teahouse worker Xu Shunlin to the Hengshan dock to ask the boatman if there was a letter for someone (the name specified in the letter). The boatman gave the teahouse worker the fake letter entrusted by the person surnamed. Just as he was about to put it away, the secret agents disguised as monks jumped out of the boat and arrested Xu and took him to the Xiesheng Hotel. However, the traveler who had come earlier had heard the news and fled. The teahouse worker was taken to the bureau for questioning, and the escaped criminal was ordered to be arrested in order to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>

Lu Shu Bao shouted for help. Police chief Chen entered the house to investigate and saw that Shu Bao's right foot was chained to a huge rock by her husband, preventing her from moving. Later, the villagers found Liang Shugen and brought him back. He found a way to remove the iron chain and sent the man and woman and Sheng to Songjiang together. The prosecutor Shengku questioned them and ordered Liang Shugen to be detained for obstructing freedom. Lu Shu Bao was taken back by her mother, Sheng, to await summons.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Xujiang People Petition for Protection</h3>
<p>Xujiang in Suzhou borders Taihu Lake and is located in a dangerous area, which has always been an area where bandits appear. There used to be water police stationed there. Since the water police were reorganized, the local defense has been empty, and the local people are extremely panicked. Yesterday (5th) morning, more than 100 villagers went to the Second District Office in Mudu to petition, demanding that a battalion be sent to garrison as soon as possible to maintain law and order. The district chief Hui Hong urgently telegraphed the Second District of the Water Public Security Bureau, requesting the dispatch of a team to garrison. District Chief Wei, according to the telegram, sent Captain Wang Rongxian of the Fifth Team, leading four gunboats, to garrison in Xujiang.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Revenge Murder</h3>
<p>Deng Zhenquan, a resident of Huangshi Street, 61st District, 15th District (Qingcheng City) in the county, was a tailor by profession and came from a poor family. At about 9:00 PM on the previous night (4th), A Lin, the son of Hong Pei from Zhuangjia Lane, 62nd District, nearby, was drinking with Zhenquan in a certain hotel on the street. Later, because Zhenquan drank too much wine, the two sides had an argument for some reason, which led to violence. Zhenquan, in a moment of anger, punched A Lin twice, but unfortunately hit a vital point, and A Lin fell to the ground and died. Afterwards, someone reported this to Hong Pei, who tied up the murderer Deng Zhenquan with a rope and decided to send him to the city today. The chief of the township also reported the matter to the court for an autopsy. However, it is said that there was another reason why Deng Zhenquan killed A Lin, which led to the tragedy. Also, Wang Yunquan, a villager from Fanjia Bang, Tang Zhuang Township, 355th District, 12th District, was drinking near the Daqiang Gate and returned home the previous night. He met two villagers on the way who were old enemies and beat Xuequan to death. The murderer saw that he had caused a disaster and fled. Later, the chief of the township, Lu Zhongying, came to the city to report the matter to the court and requested an autopsy. According to the report, the prosecutor's office sent the prosecutor and his staff by car to the countryside to conduct an autopsy yesterday (5th). The autopsy revealed that the deceased, Wu Yunquan, died from being beaten. After the autopsy, he ordered the corpse to be placed in a coffin for burial, pending the arrest of the murderer.</p>
<h3>Changshu Boat Traveling at Night Encountered Robbery and Capsized</h3>
<p>Wang Yongzhang, a musician from Wuxi, came to Changshu with five or six partners the day before yesterday at the invitation of someone surnamed in this county. On the 3rd, they took a boat back to Wuxi. When sailing through Shigubridge in Taihe Township, 9th District of this county, it was already 9:00 PM. Suddenly, they saw many boats, carrying more than a dozen bandits, chasing after them. They realized that something was wrong and urged the boatman to row quickly. Before long, they were overtaken, and they were ordered to stop the boat. Five or six people jumped out and violently attacked the bow of the boat with weapons, and then looted at will. At that time, Wang and others were extremely frightened and tried to avoid being caught, which caused the weight to be uneven and the boat capsized. The bandits and the musicians all drowned at the bottom of the river. When the bandit boat saw what had happened, they quickly rescued their comrades and fled. The musicians were mostly skilled swimmers and did not drown, but the boatman's three-year-old child was not rescued in time and drowned.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Zhixin Steamer Crew Beating Person to Death</h3>

A Zhaiqiao resident named Zhang Jinrong boarded the ship to return home. A quarrel arose with the ship owner, Gu Pandai, and his brother, Rongjin, over ticket purchase, leading to a scuffle. Rongjin happened to be holding a machine steel plate clamp, which he used to injure Zhang Jinrong's waist. Striking a vital point, Zhang suddenly died on the 4th. His wife, Zhang Yangshi, believing her husband's death to be unnatural, immediately reported it to the local Public Security Police Station. The Gu Pandai and Rongjin brothers were placed under supervision, and the report was forwarded to the Nabenzhen District Office for referral to the county court to send personnel to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<h3>Young Girl Opposes Marriage and Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>In Dawangzhuang, Chemahu District, there lived a man named Yu Xi who did not engage in proper work. In the 18th year of the Republic, he joined the Communist Party and engaged in robbery. In the 19th year, he surrendered to the local District Office. Fourteen years ago, he engaged a matchmaker named Liu Gui and betrothed himself to the daughter of Wang Si from Fanjiazhuang. At that time, Wang's daughter was only seven years old, and it was entirely arranged by her parents. Recently, the girl had grown up, gained some knowledge, and learned that Yu, although having surrendered, was still of bad character. She expressed her opposition to her parents and requested the dissolution of the engagement. However, Yu learned of this and secretly bribed the matchmaker, Liu Gui, to facilitate the marriage. After receiving the bribe, Liu Gui went to the Wang family and used all kinds of threats to force Wang to agree. Wang was helpless and had already chosen a date for the wedding. When the girl heard about this, overwhelmed with hatred, she suddenly conceived a suicidal thought. Yesterday, taking advantage of the family's unpreparedness, she hanged herself. It is truly tragic.</p>

In a daze, they knocked over a kerosene lamp, which fell into the cotton and spread to the wooden walls. In an instant, flames soared. The police on duty at the post heard the alarm and reported it to the headquarters, which alerted the Public Security Bureau's fire brigade and various rescue teams. They rushed to extinguish the fire, which took three hours to put out. It is estimated that 64 shops and houses were burned down, with losses estimated at over 100,000 yuan.

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After performing the formalities, Chairman Huang Zaoxiong gave a report, stating that today is the anniversary of the Zhaoh He warship uprising. The meaning of this commemoration and the circumstances of its passage are explained in detail in the publicity outline and need not be repeated. There are two points worth noting in this commemoration: (1) This commemoration can be said to be the commemoration of the recreation of the Republic of China. Since the Xinhai Revolution, people generally believed that the revolution had succeeded. Therefore, revolutionary thought gradually declined, and revolutionaries became increasingly corrupt. Yuan Shikai took the opportunity to seize power and expand his influence to the south, oppressing party members and plotting to restore the imperial system. Seeing this phenomenon, the Premier actively sought another countermeasure. At that time, Chen Ying Shi, a martyr, was ordered to work in Shanghai, which led to the Zhaoh He uprising. This action is most valuable to the history of our party. This is the first point. (2) There are many revolutionary anniversaries, but this anniversary is even more worthy of commemoration. At that time, Yuan's party was all over the place. The martyrs Wang Xiaofeng and Wang Mingshan assassinated Zheng Rucheng at the Baidu Bridge, surrendered generously, and died calmly. This kind of behavior of killing oneself to achieve benevolence is rarely seen at present, and so on.</p>
<h3>Representative Speeches</h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, Xu Shushen, the principal of He'an Elementary School, gave a speech, stating that the significance of the Zhaoh He warship uprising anniversary is to eliminate the hidden reefs of our party's destiny. Premier Sun led our party. If there were no hidden reefs before, the revolution would not have succeeded until the Xinhai Revolution. Since the initial success of the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese people believed that it would shine brightly. Unexpectedly, they encountered a major hidden reef, that is, Yuan Shikai's brewing of the imperial system. At that time, Yuan Shikai outwardly obeyed the party's orders and secretly plotted for autocracy. Chen Ying Shi and others launched an uprising in Shanghai. Unfortunately, at that time, the Chinese people's minds were old and numb, so the Zhaoh He warship still could not succeed. The reason was the lack of publicity. The impact of the Zhaoh He uprising later broke Yuan Shikai's dream of being an emperor. But how many hidden reefs are there? Such as Zhang Xun's restoration, warlord infighting, and the people have no peace. Even now, they cannot be completely eliminated. The biggest hidden reefs at present are the internal harassment of the Communist bandits and the external oppression of imperialism. This has caused obstacles to the revolutionary cause everywhere, and construction events cannot proceed smoothly. Facing these obstacles, it is all because the Chinese people have different steps and different opinions, and they fight each other, resulting in the current situation. Today's commemoration of Zhaoh He, we should unify the psychology of each individual from this point, enrich the strength and ideas of our compatriots and comrades, and strive to revive and build a new Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Slogans</h3>
<p>(1) The Zhaoh He uprising was a revolutionary feat to support the Republic of China and overthrow the imperial system; (2) The Zhaoh He uprising was a major key to the revival of the Republic of China; (3) The Zhaoh He uprising was the prelude to the successful uprising in Yunnan; (4) Commemorating the Zhaoh He uprising, we must prepare to recover the four northeastern provinces; (5) Inherit the spirit of the martyrs of the Zhaoh He uprising and resist Japan; (6) Assist the central government in eliminating the Red bandits; (7) Strive for economic construction and strengthen national power; (8) Unite sincerely and support the central government.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Special Party Headquarters held a memorial meeting for the Zhaoh He warship incident at 9 AM yesterday morning in the auditorium of the Party Headquarters. More than a hundred committee members, staff, and representatives of various seamen's groups from the Shanghai District Party Headquarters and District Branch attended. After the formal ceremonies, Committee Member Ma Bolin reported on the beginning and end of the Zhaoh He incident, stating that in the autumn of the fourth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai secretly plotted to restore the imperial system. His henchmen were all over the country. Zheng Rucheng, the Shanghai and Songhu garrison commander, was one of them. Mr. Chen Ying Shi, under the order of the Premier, and Comrade Chiang Kai-shek presided over the revolutionary affairs in Shanghai. On December 5, he ordered Mr. Yang Xiaotian to lead more than 20 marines to occupy the Zhaoh He warship. The officers and soldiers of the ship were strictly forbidden to chop the ammunition depot in the cabin with axes, take out ammunition, and fire cannons to attack the manufacturing bureau, firing more than 60 shots. There was no response on land. As they were wondering, the Yingrui and Tongji rebel ships had been heavily bribed by Yuan's army and counterattacked the Zhaoh He, firing several shots that hit the ship, injuring many soldiers of the Zhaoh He. At the same time, Yuan's army was densely deployed on land, cutting off communication. Bolin and more than 20 comrades calmly fought with Mr. Yang Xiaotian. Late at night, there was no support on land, and the rebel ships continued to attack. At the same time, the Zhaoh He's anchor hoisting machine was destroyed by rebel artillery fire and could not be used to hoist the anchor and sail the ship. They had no choice but to temporarily go ashore. Bolin and Mr. Yang Xiaotian braved all kinds of hardships and returned to the general headquarters in the French Concession the next day to pay their respects to Mr. Chen Ying Shi and ask for instructions for another uprising. During the second uprising, Bolin was ordered to go to Humen, where he was intercepted by Li Fulin and sent to Long Jiguang in Guangzhou, where he was detained for more than 50 days. Just in time for the Yunnan uprising, he regained his freedom. At that time, Mr. Yang Xiaotian was the commander of the navy, and Bolin was the commander-in-chief of the marines. This uprising took a lot of effort. Although it was unsuccessful, it chilled Yuan's thieves. Therefore, Yuan died of depression during the Yunnan uprising. This is a great commemoration of our party's overthrow of the old warlords. The meeting adjourned at 11 AM.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 18th anniversary of the Zhaoh He warship uprising. The preparatory committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union held a ceremony at 10 AM in commemoration. More than a hundred people attended, including all the staff and representatives of various seamen's groups in Shanghai. It was originally scheduled for Yang Hu, a standing committee member of the union, to personally report on the incident at the time and his current feelings. However, due to a temporary matter, Secretary Hou Dachun represented the chairman and reported on the incident. Then Secretary Sun Liping and various representatives spoke one after another, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic, reaching a temporary climax.</p>
<h3>Zhaoh He School</h3>
<p>The Zhaoh He Middle School, established in memory of the Zhaoh He uprising, held a memorial meeting in the school's auditorium at 8 AM yesterday morning. More than 300 people attended, including all teachers, students, parents, and guests. The inside and outside of the venue were covered with slogans, and a half-mast was flown, creating a very solemn atmosphere. First, Principal Jia, the chairman, reported on the details of the Zhaoh He warship uprising, followed by a speech by Mr. Zheng Xiping, who was familiar with the Zhaoh He uprising. His words were very alert and contained encouragement. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders All Shipping Companies to Prohibit Shanghai-Fujian Navigation - Foreign Ships Entering and Leaving Are Also Subject to Inspection</h3>
<p>Since the Fujian Incident occurred, the Ministry of Communications, in order to prevent treacherous people from secretly transporting military supplies to support the Fujian side, specially ordered the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau to instruct all commercial shipping companies to temporarily suspend all Shanghai-Fujian routes. If it is necessary to pass through Fuzhou, it is also not allowed to stop. After receiving the order, the bureau immediately instructed the shipping companies to be informed. In addition to the state-run China Merchants Bureau, which had already suspended operations before receiving the order, the Shanghai-Fujian routes of other companies such as Sanbei and Chang'an were immediately suspended after receiving the order and changed routes. As for foreign ships such as Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., they still operate as usual, but they must be inspected by the navy when passing through the mouth of the sea.</p>
<h3>News of the Current Situation After the Fujian Incident Comes from the Shipping Industry - Fujian Seaport is Virtually Blockaded - The Market is as Stable as Ever</h3>
<p>Since the Fujian Incident occurred, Shanghai has been rumored that the situation on the border between Zhejiang and Fujian is tense. Yesterday, this port received a telegram from Fujian, stating that the situation in Fuzhou has gradually eased. However, foreign ships entering and leaving have been inspected. The true situation in Fujian is described as follows:</p>
<h3>Navy Inspects Foreign Ships</h3>
<p>When the Fuzhou mutiny started, the central government immediately dispatched the First Fleet of the Navy to Sanduo Bay, ready to blockade the Fujian sea and cut off Fujian's supplies. However, because foreign merchant ships were operating as usual, the naval authorities had no way to block the Fujian port. The situation is now tense, and since the 2nd of this month, it can no longer wait. Therefore, the warships in Sanduo Bay have been dispatched to the port of Fuzhou to inspect all merchant ships coming to and from the port of Fujian. However, domestic ships have already suspended operations. At present, only British and Japanese foreign ships are coming and going. A few days ago, the Hengsheng wheel of Jardine Matheson Company arrived in Fujian from the port. When it entered the port of Fujian, the Yixian warship ordered it to dock and sent officers and soldiers to board the ship to interrogate the passengers in detail, inspect their luggage, and open the cargo hold for inspection. When the ship left Fuzhou, it was the same. Therefore, the sea transportation in Fuzhou is no less than a virtual blockade.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Request Exemption from Inspection</h3>
<p>The owner of the Hengsheng wheel reported to the Shanghai office of this trip back to Shanghai. The Shanghai office stated that the regular Fuzhou ship Jiesheng must also operate. The Navy's inspection is not necessary. It is heard that the British resident Chinese consul has presented a request to our government for exemption from inspection in order to avoid causing disputes.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Ships Operate as Usual</h3>
<p>Xiamen is also an important seaport in Fujian Province. Since President Chiang ordered domestic ships not to stop at the coastal ports of Fujian Province, Chinese merchant ships have suspended operations. Foreign ships in the port are still operating as usual. Yesterday, the Dutch ship Zhibada came to Shanghai from Xiamen. According to people on the ship, the authorities in Xiamen, considering that there are many foreigners in Xiamen, especially Taiwanese people, are deeply afraid of causing disputes. Therefore, they still do not inspect foreign ships entering and leaving as usual. However, the transportation of goods in the area has been affected by the situation and has sharply reduced.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Market is Stable</h3>
<p>The director of the Fuzhou branch of a British shipping company in Shanghai sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, reporting on the recent situation in Fujian Province, stating that the situation in Fujian has gradually eased in recent days, the market is stable, and panic has been slightly reduced. Goods are still being shipped out. Also, according to passengers who arrived in Shanghai on the Hengsheng wheel, the city of Fuzhou has been as usual for the past few days, and even armed soldiers are rarely seen. At the moment, the authorities in Fujian Province are eager to move the government to Zhangzhou. As for the 19th Route Army, most of them have been transferred to the border of Jianou.</p>
<h3>The Three Unified Taxes on Cigarettes, Cement, and Matches Were Increased Yesterday - The Unified Tax Office Announced New Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The new customs tariff revised by the Ministry of Finance is scheduled to be implemented from January 1 next year. The three unified taxes on cigarettes, cement, and matches were increased yesterday. The new tax rates for cigarettes, etc., announced by the Unified Tax Office yesterday are recorded below: (Matches) Match tax rates were not classified for collection. Now, they are divided into two categories: sulfide and safety. Sulfide matches are divided into two tax rates: A and B. Type A is taxed at 10.8 yuan per large box, and Type B is 13.5 yuan. Safety matches are divided into three tax rates: A, B, and C. Type A is taxed at 13.5 yuan per box, Type B is 17.4 yuan, and Type C is 21 yuan. Small boxes are calculated at one-tenth of the price. (Cigarette Tax Rates: Type A has increased from 55 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes to 80 yuan, and Type B has increased from 95 yuan to 160 yuan.) (Cement) The new cement tax rate is 1.2 yuan for every 170 kilograms, 8 jiao for 113.33 kilograms, 6 jiao for 85 kilograms, 4.6 jiao for 63.5 kilograms, 4 jiao for 56.67 kilograms, 3.6 jiao for 49.9 kilograms, and 2 jiao for 42.2 kilograms.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Firmly Oppose the Increased Cigarette Tax - The Trade Association Will Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss</h3>
<p>Dagon Society says that the Ministry of Finance has recently increased the three unified taxes on matches, cement, and cigarettes, starting yesterday, in order to slightly compensate for the fact that the national treasury is in deficit and the military and political expenses are in great need of funds. However, manufacturers have opposed this one after another. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Cigarette Trade Will Hold a Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Trade Association believes that the cigarette business in Shanghai has been declining recently due to weak social purchasing power. Many cigarette factories have closed down. Now, the Ministry of Finance has suddenly increased the unified tax, which will have a major impact on business. Therefore, it is specially scheduled to convene a general meeting at the meeting place on Mei Baige Road at 2 PM today to discuss countermeasures and unanimously request a postponement of the tax. Wang Wenjing, a member of the Cigarette Trade Association, also said that the matter of increasing the cigarette unified tax has been sent to the authorities for consultation on several matters, requesting that the business difficulties be taken into account and the implementation be temporarily postponed. The tax authorities have agreed to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance for instructions, but starting yesterday, all products from various factories have been taxed according to the new regulations.</p>
<h3>The Tax Office States That It Is Handling Matters Under Orders</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Tax Office, the Tax Office is handling this increase in the unified tax under the order of the Ministry. If manufacturers have any opinions, the Tax Office can only forward the original intentions to the higher level. All measures must be decided by the Ministry of Finance. The Tax Office has no authority to approve them alone. In the future, cigarettes from various factories will not be allowed to leave the factory without new stamps. Otherwise, they will be detained.</p>
<h3>The Increase in Comparison of New and Old Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The cigarette unified tax has always used 50,000 cigarettes as the standard. The old tax rates are divided into two levels: the first level is taxed at 95 yuan for those with a selling price of more than 260 yuan, and the second level is taxed at 55 yuan for those with a selling price of less than 260 yuan. The new tax rate is that the first level is for those with a selling price of more than 300 yuan and taxed at 160 yuan (65 yuan more than before), and the second level is for those with a selling price of less than 300 yuan and taxed at 80 yuan (25 yuan more than before). However, the above is calculated for 50,000 cigarettes. If calculated for each can (50 cigarettes), only 6.5 fen and 2.5 fen are added. For each pack (10 cigarettes), only 12 copper coins are added. Therefore, according to the Tax Office, the amount is not very large.</p>
<h3>The US Ambassador Will Go to Beijing Tonight - Mayor Wu Is Scheduled to Host a Dinner Tonight</h3>
<p>US Ambassador Johnson traveled to Hong Kong, Guangdong, Xiamen, Shantou, and other places and returned to Shanghai on the President Coolidge wheel at 4 PM the day before yesterday. Mayor Wu will host a dinner tonight to welcome him. The US Ambassador will take the night train to Beijing tonight to visit the Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, this is the first visit between the two countries' ambassadors to China.</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News said that US Ambassador Johnson returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 4th). Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov was delayed in Nanjing due to business. As a result, the formal visit between the two ambassadors after the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia was delayed by this hide-and-seek itinerary. According to the news that the United States recognized the Soviet Union, when it arrived in Shanghai, it happened that Ambassador Johnson was aboard a ship leaving Shanghai, and Ambassador Bogomolov was also in Beijing. Only US Consul General Cunningham and Russian Consul General Spivaniuk visited each other. When Ambassador Bogomolov returned to Shanghai, he expressed his eagerness to meet Ambassador Johnson, but he soon went to Beijing on business and stayed there until now. Although Ambassador Johnson is scheduled to take the train to Beijing tomorrow night, Ambassador Bogomolov is said to be returning to Shanghai tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. It is still difficult to determine whether the first visit after the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two ambassadors will be held in Shanghai or Nanjing. Ambassador Johnson arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is staying at the home of US Ambassador Pendy. Today, he told reporters that he last visited Guangdong in 1925. He was deeply surprised by the rapid progress of Guangzhou, which has become a truly modern city. He did not land in Fuzhou on the way because the Guzstai ship he was riding on was too deep and could not reach Luoxing Pagoda, so he took a small boat to Nantai. The local consuls and Chinese and foreign friends in Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong were very generous. It is heard that Mayor Wu of this port will host a dinner for Ambassador Johnson tomorrow night. Ambassador Johnson will stay in Nanjing for a week and is expected to return to Beiping around Saturday next week.</p>

<h3>Mo Dehui Issues a Written Statement - He Will Go to Beijing Soon to Report on the International Situation - He Expressed His Sadness After Hearing About the Fujian Incident Upon Returning to China</h3>
<p>Xinsheng Society said that Mr. Mo Dehui, China's former plenipotentiary representative to the Sino-Soviet Conference, returned to Shanghai the night before last. Because he was tired from the journey, he could not chat with reporters for a while. He specially issued a written statement to the Xinsheng Society reporters who visited yesterday, stating that since the Sino-Soviet Conference was suspended last year, he suffered from headaches and insomnia, so he asked for leave to go to Germany for medical treatment. He used acupuncture treatment at the Berlin Flange Hospital. Later, because the climate was not suitable, he went to Rome for recuperation. Now he feels gradually better, so he returned to China and intends to go to Beijing soon to report to the government on the international situation he learned in Europe. As soon as he entered the country, he heard about the Fujian Incident, planning to split, and giving people opportunities. The country is like this. He cannot help but feel sad, and he is very unhappy in spirit. He plans to go to Beiping for recuperation in the future. He met Zhang Hanqing in Rome. Recent reports say that he is about to return to China, which may be true.</p>
<h3>The Fujian Side Issued a Mobilization Order the Day Before Yesterday - It is Heard That They Will Attack Zhejiang in Two Routes - The Central Army is Preparing to Counterattack</h3>
<p>Xinsheng Society said that the military attempt of the Fujian side to attack Zhejiang to the north has already started in mobilization. A reporter from Xinsheng Society met a gentleman who came to Shanghai from Fujian the day before yesterday. According to the conversation, the Fujian side has appointed Qiu Zhaochen as the commander of the advance guard to attack Zhejiang. His troops, consisting of two regiments, have been ordered to depart for the border between Zhejiang and Fujian. Tan Qixiu, the commander of the newly organized Fifth Route Army, has returned to his original defense in northern Fujian. Tan and the other route commanders once had a military meeting, the content of which was very secret. Cai Tingkai has moved his headquarters from Zhangzhou to Fuzhou and is heard to have issued a general mobilization order at 10 PM on the 4th. The strategy of marching into Zhejiang is heard to be to advance in two routes. It is rumored that the left wing will attack southern Zhejiang from western Fujian, and the right wing will advance along the Fujian coastline to spy on Ruian and Wenzhou. In addition, a reporter from Xinsheng Society investigated that the central government's military deployment on the Zhejiang border has been completed. Liu Heding has sincerely expressed his support for the central government and has established close contact with the central army. If the Fujian army attacks on the left wing, they will be met with a head-on blow. Wenzhou can also prevent the Fujian army on the right wing, and the navy and air force are also prepared. When the war breaks out, they can all be dispatched at the same time. According to military observers, the Fujian Incident has no military value. If the Fujian side dares to take this risk, the war will start and end quickly. The 19th Route Army will not be able to support a long battle.</p>
<h3>Wang Chia-chen's Remarks: When He Will Enter Beijing is Not Yet Certain</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that Mr. Wang Chia-chen, the advisor to the delegation sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Europe to attend the League of Nations, was ordered to work in various European and American countries. Now that his duties have been completed, he arrived in Shanghai the night before last on the same ship as Mr. Mo Teh-hui, the plenipotentiary representative of our country at the previous Sino-Soviet Conference. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Mr. Wang at a friend's residence and had a brief conversation with him. He said that he (referring to himself, Wang Chia-chen) was ordered to go to Europe in 1931 as a representative of the office of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations. Subsequently, due to the September 18th Incident, he was ordered to attend the League of Nations Council together with Minister Shih Chao-chi and others to handle the negotiations on the Sino-Japanese issue. In 1932, he was reassigned as an advisor to the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations and went to the United States to work that summer, only returning to Europe this spring before returning to China. While in Europe, he read various Chinese newspapers and realized that our country's understanding of international affairs was even better than that of other countries. However, in recent world events since the Great War, the momentum of nationalism has been increasing day by day, and the previous free trade has been changed to protectionist trade. At the same time, many national political systems are trending towards dictatorship. As for when he will enter Beijing from Shanghai, it is not yet certain. He will probably rest in Shanghai for a few more days. As for Mr. Chang Hsueh-liang in Europe, he has already met with him. Although Mr. Chang will return to China, the exact date is still unknown. It is also not clear whether the central government will grant Mr. Chang any title upon his return. In addition, Mr. Wang's views on national affairs are the same as those of Mo Teh-hui, which is filled with profound sentiment.</p>

<h3>Radio Inventor Marconi to Visit Shanghai: Arriving on the 8th and Returning to Europe on the 12th; Italian Consulate Arranges Welcome Program</h3>
<p>Radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi and his wife (Italians) are currently circumnavigating the world. They left Japan for China on the 25th of last month. It is understood that Mr. Marconi arrived in the capital yesterday (the 5th) at 3 PM aboard the train from Pukou to Shanghai. Wang Chong-zhi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Beijing Municipal Government, Yan Ren-guang, Director of the Department of Electrical Affairs of the Ministry of Communications, Shen Shih-hua, Director of General Affairs, and the Protocol Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs all sent personnel to cross the river to welcome him. That evening, they attended a banquet hosted by Chu Chia-hua and Shih Ying. It is also reported that Mr. Marconi will stay in Beijing for a day or two before coming to Shanghai. The Italian Consulate in Shanghai has already completed the preparations for welcoming and hosting Mr. and Mrs. Marconi yesterday. The Italian Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Cat Nenyron said that Mr. Marconi is scheduled to meet with the Chairman of the Chinese National Government on the 6th of this month and will be hosted by Zhu Jia-hua, Minister of Communications. He will leave Beijing for Shanghai on the 7th. Those accompanying Mr. Marconi include Italian Envoy Mr. and Mrs. RBoselarelii, and their secretary Mr. V. Morconi, who is familiar with the situation in China and is known as a "China expert". It is possible that Mr. Marconi will stop in Suzhou for a visit en route to Shanghai, so it is difficult to predict when he will arrive in Shanghai. However, no matter what, the Italian community in Shanghai will host a public banquet for Mr. Marconi at the Italian Club at noon on the 8th. In the afternoon, a joint banquet will be held by Jiaotong University, the Shanghai University Professors and Staff Association, and the Chinese Institute of Engineers to celebrate his great achievements in invention.

At that time, the Italian Club will host a farewell banquet, and it is rumored that Mr. Marconi will give a speech on radio and culture. (New News Agency)</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Flights Departed as Usual Yesterday; Normal Landings at Fuzhou Station; Damaged Aircraft No. 16 Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong scheduled flights departed as usual yesterday, taking off from Longhua Airport at 6:15 AM. Normal landings were also made at Fuzhou Station. According to the person in charge of the company, Aircraft No. 16 was disassembled in the Zhoushan Islands some days ago, loaded onto a ship, and transported to Shanghai. It is currently being repaired at Longhua Airport. The extent of the damage has not been reported by the aircraft and flight crew, so the details are unknown. As for the injured passengers, they are receiving treatment at Hong'en Hospital and are progressing well. One passenger with the surname Zhang, who was traveling from Shanghai to Fujian, has recovered and been discharged from the hospital, and has taken a ship to Fujian.</p>
<h3>Japanese Expel Overseas Chinese; Overseas Chinese Being Expelled</h3>
<p>Chinese laborers and restaurant owners Zhang Maoqing, Zheng Jiaxiang, Pan Ding-san, Pan Hong-ba, Chen Shun-huai, Chen Bao-hui, Guo Yu-guang, Jiang De-fang, Wang Ming-cai, Zhang Ming-ji, Xia Rui-chang, Wang Yu-biao, and others, totaling more than twenty people, in Japanese ports such as Yokohama, Nagoya, and Kobe, were unable to find work in Japan. The Japanese authorities, on the pretext that these unemployed overseas Chinese should return to their home country, put them on Japanese ships and forbade them from going to Japan again. These overseas Chinese were mostly from Qingtian, Ruian, and Fuzhou areas of Zhejiang. They were expelled back to Shanghai yesterday, their travel expenses exhausted, and their situation was dire. Most of them went to Nanshi and temporarily stayed in small inns before returning to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Voyages to Japan Nearly Extinct</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese shipping companies announced new regulations for overseas Chinese traveling to Japan, effective December 1st, requiring a deposit of 100 yen and deducting various expenses, such as the cost of returning to China if landing is denied, from this deposit, the number of Chinese businessmen and laborers traveling to Japan has almost completely stopped. Most laborers and small businessmen do not have the financial capacity and cannot bear the various mistreatments. Therefore, the passenger business of Japanese ships in Shanghai has plummeted. The number of third-class passengers on each outbound ship is only one-tenth of what it was last month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants' Shipping Industry in Decline; Even with Government Subsidies, It is Still Useless; Forced to Operate, Chinese Compradors Are Constantly Complaining</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Japanese shipping company Nisshin Kisen Kaisha mainly operates routes along the Yangtze River, followed by routes in the North and South Seas, all of which are Chinese routes. Since the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, the company has been affected by the Chinese boycott, and 24 ships have been successively suspended. In order to maintain the original routes, the Japanese government provided subsidies, and the company resumed the Yangtze River routes with four ships, the Luoyang Maru, Xiangyang Maru, Nanyang Maru, and Fengyang Maru, and the North and South Seas routes with four ships, the Huashan Maru, Songshan Maru, Lushan Maru, and Tangshan Maru, for a total of eight ships. Despite repeated price reductions to attract customers, the company's efforts to recover have been ineffective. It was forced to either sell or dismantle nine ships, including the Daifuku and Dairi, that had been suspended, and there is still no possibility of recovery. Each time goods are imported and exported, except for Japanese transit goods, Chinese goods are absent. The income from passenger fares and freight charges is not enough to cover the operating expenses of the ships. Although the company receives subsidies from the Japanese government, the Chinese compradors are constantly complaining. If there is no turnaround, it will be useless, and the ships that are forced to operate will inevitably be completely suspended, resulting in liquidation.</p>

<h3>Family Representatives of Kim Seok Petition the Municipal Government for Rescue Yesterday; Lawyer Xu Questioned the French Police Yesterday; Negotiations with the French Consul General Will Continue This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that Kim Seok, a Korean who has become a Chinese citizen, was illegally arrested by the Japanese consul in the French Concession. His family has petitioned the Municipal Government for negotiations, but there has been no news for more than ten days. According to a report a few days ago, Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government said that he had ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate when Kim temporarily became a Chinese citizen and then conduct formal negotiations. Therefore, in addition to entrusting the law firm of Lou Jiu-mei, Xu Jie, and Luo Zhao-xin to handle the legal procedures, his family also asked Mr. Chen Yang and Mr. Li Shi-chang as representatives to go to the Municipal Government at 4 PM yesterday to submit the naturalization permit to prove his citizenship. They also stated that Kim and his son were illegally arrested in the winter of the previous year, and the Municipal Government and various legal groups also based on this point to conduct serious negotiations for his release. They also made it clear that various legal groups in Shanghai, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, the Lawyers Association, and wise men at home and abroad, are willing to come to the rescue, because such illegal arrests not only infringe on Kim's personal legal rights, but also damage national sovereignty, and asked for vigorous negotiations to secure his early release, which would not only be Kim's fortune, but also comfort the expectations of society. Mayor Wu sent someone to receive them and promised to conduct serious negotiations.</p>
<h3>Family Representatives</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reporter, because of the Kim Seok arrest case, visited Kim Seok's lawyers Xu Jie</p>
<h3>Questioning the Police</h3>
<p>Regarding the arrest, Lawyer Xu Jie said at the law firm that at 5 PM yesterday, this lawyer, accompanied by Mr. Li Shi-chang, representative of the Kim Seok family, went to the Lou-za-wan French Police Station to visit Political Director Harri and questioned him on the spot as follows: (Question) (Lawyer Xu): Is there a fact that Kim Seok, a citizen of the Republic of China, was arrested by your police station? (Answer) (Harri): A person named Kim Seok was arrested. (Question): On what day and at what time was he arrested? (Answer): At approximately 7 PM on November 22nd. (Question): Where was he arrested? (Answer): He was arrested at 451 Rue du Père Huc. (Question): How many people went to arrest him? (Answer): Three policemen from the Japanese Consulate and three French policemen assisted. (Question): Can you tell me the names of the people who went to arrest him? (Answer): It is not convenient to tell you. (Question): On what grounds did your police station arrest him? (Answer): We were only assisting at the request of the Japanese consul. (Question): Is Kim Seok still being held at your police station? (Answer): He was already taken away by the Japanese consulate. (Question): How long was he detained at your police station, and on what day was he handed over to the Japanese consulate? (Answer): He was not detained at the police station. After being arrested, he was briefly questioned and then taken away by the Japanese police. (Question): Kim Seok is a citizen of the Republic of China. Why did your police station hand him over to the Japanese consulate? (Answer): When the police station asked Kim Seok what country he was from, Kim Seok said that he was Korean, so the police station had no right to detain him and handed him over to the Japanese consulate. Kim Seok was only at the police station for a short time. (Question): Kim Seok has been naturalized as a Chinese citizen for many years and has a naturalization permit as proof. His family has presented it to your police station. (Answer): Kim Seok did not have his citizenship permit with him. If he had presented his naturalization permit at the time, he would not have been taken away by the Japanese police. (Question): Kim Seok claims to be Korean. Does your police station have a record of his confession? (Answer): There is no record of his confession. (Question): Why didn't the police station investigate Kim Seok's nationality? (Answer): Because he admitted it himself, there was no need to investigate. (Question): If you do not investigate based on the suspect's confession, your police station will be deceived. (Answer): The suspect admitted it himself, so the police station did not need to investigate. (Question): This year, Kim Cheol and Kim Seok, father and son, were arrested in the same way. After submitting their citizenship certificates, they were released. Your police station should know that Kim Seok is a Chinese citizen based on your duties. (Answer): I don't know about this year's arrest. (Question): According to Article 7 of the Agreed Rules for the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the French Concession, the arrested suspect should first be questioned by the competent court and not be transferred to government offices outside the concession. Kim Seok is a citizen of the Republic of China and should be transferred to the Chinese court. (Answer): I really didn't know that Kim Seok had been naturalized as a Chinese citizen and obtained Chinese citizenship, and he himself admitted that he was Korean. (Question): Now that it has been proven that Kim Seok is a citizen, your police station should take Kim Seok back from the Japanese consulate. If he is suspected of a crime, he should be handed over to the Chinese court; otherwise, he should be released. (Answer): This is a matter of negotiation between China and Japan. The French police station cannot help. (Question): Kim Seok was handed over to the Japanese consulate by your police station. Your police station should take him back. (Answer): This matter requires requesting the French consul to consult with the Japanese consulate. Because it was late, we said goodbye to Mr. Li and left.</p>

<h3>Should Delivery Notes Be Affixed with Stamps? The Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Industry Association Sends a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Explanation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Food Industry Association has recently received reports from various member factories, companies, and stores that the Shangbao Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau has ordered the shops to affix stamps to the delivery notes they issue, and has imposed severe penalties for non-compliance. Furthermore, the Bureau even found that the Dehua Biscuit Factory on Zhaozhou Road had affixed a stamp worth one cent to a receipt with a value of 88 cents, and accused them of not affixing a sufficient number of stamps, which was inappropriate. Yesterday, the Association sent a letter to the Shangbao County Committee for the Trial of Violations of the Stamp Tax Regulations, asking them to withdraw the original case and re-examine it. They also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for explanation. The letter stated: "Our Association has found that shops are required to issue delivery notes to customers every month for all outstanding payments for verification, and then go to collect the payments when they are due. These delivery notes only contain the nature of requesting payment and verifying whether there are any errors in the quantity. Before the customer seeks payment, they must be listed in detail and sent every month. If the customer delays payment, the delivery note must also be issued monthly and cannot be omitted. Therefore, these delivery notes do not involve the transfer of money, so most of them do not affix stamps. When the payment is received and a receipt is issued, the stamps are affixed in accordance with the regulations. This is an exercise of obligation under the principle of parallel rights and obligations, and there is no doubt about it. However, the Stamp Tax Bureau does not have clear regulations on whether this type of delivery note should be affixed with stamps, and relies on its one-sided whims to impose heavy fines on the grounds of not affixing stamps. Our Association has repeatedly received reports from its members, who all say that if they affix stamps to each delivery note, they cannot afford it; if they do not affix stamps, they are at risk of being heavily fined. They are in a dilemma and at a loss. We are sending a special letter to your Association to ask for an explanation, so that we can follow it and alleviate the merchants' difficulties."

<h3>Suddenly Abducted, Rich Merchant Yang Shousheng From Suzhou</h3>
<p>The case of Yang Shousheng, a rich merchant from Suzhou residing in front of the old county government office in Nanshi, who was kidnapped by bandits near the back door of his residence on Guangqi Road at 6 PM on the 6th of last month, has been reported in detail in this newspaper. However, since the case occurred, Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hong-en has been unusually attentive and has repeatedly ordered his subordinates to solve the case within a limited time. Unfortunately, the bandits are cunning and try their best to avoid the eyes of the arresting officers. Yang escaped safely some days ago. According to news from Yang's residence, Yang has indeed escaped danger and is currently recuperating in the hospital and has not returned home. It is said that Yang was in the bandits' den for a total of 26 days. The bandits were heavily guarded, making it difficult to escape. One day, Yang pretended to be asleep and overheard the guards whispering to each other that the rumors outside were very tight, the detectives were investigating, and it was probably necessary to move to another location. On this day, it became clear that Yang was about to be moved. Two guards helped him out of the plain house. He saw that the place resembled a township and instantly arrived in the fields. One of the guards, who had been with Yang for a long time and was more amiable than the other bandits, was persuaded by Yang to abandon evil and return to righteousness. The guard expressed his sympathy, but lamented that there was no opportunity to help him escape. At this time, Yang had an idea and said to him, "I need to relieve myself." The guard helped him to the field, while the other acted as a lookout because the sky was already breaking and people were gradually becoming visible. Yang said to the guard who was helping him, "Help me, now is the time!" The guard went to the lookout to pretend to look for toilet paper. Yang took the opportunity to stand up and ran wildly away from the guard. After about a quarter of an hour, he saw electric lights and a road, seemingly near the Sun Temple. He immediately took a rickshaw to his relative's house. At that time, he was like a drunken man. His relative sent him to the hospital for recuperation. The doctor said that Yang's nerves were very weak and that he needed to go to a quiet place for recuperation. It is likely that his family will accompany him to Hangzhou for recuperation.</p>
<h3>The Arrest of Lu Yunlun, a Fugitive in the Kidnapping Case of Le Zhenbao</h3>
<p>Le Zhenbao, a native of Ningbo and owner of Taichang Wood Shop on Nanjing Road, was kidnapped on the morning of December 9th of last year at the intersection of Yu Garden Road and Hart Road. The kidnappers demanded a large ransom. Subsequently, Chief Detective You A’gen of the Lao Zha police, rescued Le at No. 911 Haig Road within a foreign residence, and arrested more than ten kidnappers, including Ma Gensheng. They were handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and sentencing. At that time, the criminals confessed that Lu Yunlun (also known as Jinbao and Ji Ting) was also one of the accomplices. The police offered a reward for his arrest. On the afternoon of the previous day, at 3:45 PM, Liu Junqing, a Chinese detective from the Lao Zha police, discovered Lu’s hiding place and, together with Western Detective Huito, arrested Lu on Edward Road. They brought him back to the police station and sent him to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the circumstances of the arrest and stated that the criminals who had confessed to the defendant's crime could not be presented due to time constraints and requested a postponement of the trial. Lu Yunlun denied involvement in the kidnapping, claiming he was framed. Presiding Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered Lu to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>The Reason for the Suicide of Guo Shaoheng, Chief Officer of the Jiang’an Ship: Economic Pressure Due to Multiple Wives</h3>
<p>The suicide of Guo Shaoheng, Chief Officer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Jiang’an ship, has been reported in this newspaper. The reason for his suicide was unclear. After repeated investigations by reporters, it was learned that it was due to having multiple wives and economic pressure, which led him to become disillusioned with life. The details of what was learned are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Fond of Women</h3>
<p>Guo Shaoheng served as the leading officer on the Jiang’an ship since it was built, serving in this role for more than ten years. He usually had no faults and was highly valued by the ship owners. However, he was fond of women throughout his life. Whenever the ship arrived in Shanghai or Hankou and was docked with nothing to do, he would often go out alone to seek pleasure, regardless of appearance, and would accept them all. Therefore, in addition to his legal wife, he had three concubines residing in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Hankou. How could he maintain several households with a meager salary of one hundred and eighty yuan? As a result, he experienced economic panic, which ultimately led to his suicide.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Meet his Wives</h3>
<p>In addition to his family on Haining Road in Shanghai, Guo also had a family in Hankou, with numerous children. Furthermore, he frequently engaged in extramarital affairs, leading to increased economic pressure. Consequently, household expenses were often depleted. It is said that his wife from Hong Kong came to Shanghai this time to demand money from Guo and discuss future living arrangements. Unable to cope with this situation, Guo Shaoheng committed suicide. After his death, a search of his bedroom revealed that he did not have a single penny, which further highlighted his economic distress.</p>
<h3>Haunted House</h3>
<p>After Guo's suicide, he left a letter in his room addressed to Huang Fengqi, asking him to cancel the lease for the new house he had rented in Zhabei. According to the letter, he decided to cancel the lease because ghostly apparitions had been discovered in the new house, making it impossible to live there in peace. As a result, some people speculated that since Guo had thoughts of suicide and his spirit was weakened, he was being haunted by ghosts.</p>
<h3>Many Photos</h3>
<p>Many photos of women were found in his bedroom, as well as several nude model photos. Guo also had handwritten words, the gist of which was that all the blood and energy of his life had been sacrificed for this. Currently, his body has been collected by his family in Shanghai and will be sent to the Guangzhao Villa for storage. The Jiang’an ship has already left Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shi Xianwen Found Hanging from a Tree</h3>
<p>A man's body was found hanging from a tree behind the Xu Family Bridge, facing east of Bridge No. 2 on Qimei Road in northern Shanghai, yesterday morning. The deceased appeared to be about forty years old and was wearing a dark green twill Zhongshan suit. A villager discovered the body and reported it to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District. Police dispatched to the scene searched the deceased’s pockets and found a diary with the deceased's name, Shi Xianwen, his wife, Li, and children A’fu, Fugen, and daughter Yinxiang. It is suspected that he committed suicide due to economic hardship and abandonment of his family. Therefore, the head of the 47th Tu of the 23rd Bao has been ordered to report to the local court and request an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Rong Zongjing's Lawsuit Was Heard Yesterday; The Case Was Postponed Again Due to the Defendant's Stroke and Absence</h3>
<p>Rong Zongjing, a giant in the yarn factory industry, considered the news published by the Ningbo Daily about Shenxin Yarn Factory selling Japanese goods to be inaccurate. He specially published a warning notice in various newspapers directed at the Ningbo Daily. Wang Beiping, the person in charge of the Ningbo Daily, subsequently hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-lawsuit against Rong Zongjing for defamation. The First Special District Court has held court several times, but the interrogation has not been carried out due to the defendant's absence. Yesterday afternoon, presiding judge Huang Risheng summoned the defendant, who hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Yuan Hanyun to appear in court, but still requested a postponement. They stated that Rong Zongjing was suffering from a stroke, and although he could move slightly, he still needed time to recover. However, the facts provided by the plaintiff were entirely related to Shenxin Yarn Factory, and the factory has other responsible persons who are also present in court. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Wang Beiping, stated that the news published by the Ningbo Daily about Shenxin Yarn Factory privately selling Japanese goods was obtained from the Anti-Japanese Association. The factory did not negotiate with the association but singled out the Ningbo Daily for questioning. After the warning was published, the Ningbo Daily suffered a significant negative impact, which is why the lawsuit was filed. Presiding Judge Huang stated that the defendant's presence in court was necessary for interrogation and ordered the case to be postponed to the afternoon of December 28th for further interrogation of the defendant.</p>
<h3>Prostitute Keeper Wang Caiying Sentenced to Imprisonment for Forcing a Woman into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Zhu Hongbao, a young woman in her early twenties, with a beautiful appearance, was a native of Wuzhen, Zhejiang. Two years ago, she married Lu A’da, who worked as a boatman. Lu lived on his boat, so he was unable to stay with his beautiful wife. As a result, Zhu became acquainted with Lu A’bao. In the summer of this year, A’bao lured Zhu to Shanghai with sweet words and sold her to Wang Pengying, a woman who ran a brothel at No. 507 Zhejiang Road. Thus, Zhu fell into the fire pit. Regardless of wind, rain, or snow, she had to stand on the street every night to solicit customers. Sometimes, she had to entertain two or three customers per night. If she had no customers for a day, she would be subjected to severe beatings. This kind of life was no different from hell, but the brothel keeper only knew how to make a lot of money and did not care about the happiness and suffering of the prostitutes. She was afraid that the prostitutes would escape, so she ordered the maid to closely monitor them when they went out to solicit customers and did not allow them to step beyond the boundaries. Even if they were sick, they were not allowed to see a doctor and were forced to entertain customers. Many women had lost their lives in this place. Zhu has only been engaged in this lowly profession for a few months, but she has experienced all the bitterness of it. She wanted to escape from the fire pit, but she had no chance. On the 27th of last month, she found an opportunity to report to Wang Hailin and other Chinese detectives of the Lao Zha police, who arrested Wang and the maid, Li. They also found a sixteen-year-old girl, Wu Zhaodi, in her home. After questioning, it was learned that Wu Zhaodi was sold to Wang Caiying by an old woman named Wu Zhangshi. Wu Zhangshi was also arrested and handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Feng Shide sentenced Wang Caiying to two years and six months in prison, Li to two months in prison, and Wu Zhangshi was acquitted.</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Committee of the Civilian Factory Held a Meeting Yesterday Morning to Discuss Progress; The Cost of House Repairs Was Extremely High; Half of the Funds Were Reduced and Work Is Proceeding Actively</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has established a Civilian Factory at the Civilian Residence in Gaojing Temple to provide relief to unemployed workers in the war zone. The plan had already been approved by the Municipal Government, and a preparatory committee was formed to oversee everything. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the preparatory committee members held another meeting at the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to discuss reducing repair costs and various progress plans. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Motivation for Establishing the Factory</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the homes in Wusong and Zhabei were destroyed, and countless victims of the disaster were displaced and homeless. In view of this, the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee allocated 30,000 yuan to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to provide relief. Wu Xingya, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, proposed establishing a Civilian Factory to accommodate unemployed workers in the war zone. A plan was drafted, a preparatory committee was organized, and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and reported to the Ministry of Industry for record.</p>
<h3>First to Establish Carpentry and Other Departments</h3>
<p>The establishment of the Civilian Factory is purely for the purpose of providing relief to unemployed workers in the war zone. However, due to limited funds, it will be implemented in stages. If successful, it will be expanded. The first phase will establish carpentry, copperware, straw weaving, printing, and leather goods departments, with a provisional quota of 40 workers. Because the equipment for the above five departments is relatively simple, they will be opened first.</p>
<h3>Affiliated Training Institute</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Civilian Factory, a training institute will be affiliated to the carpentry department. If necessary, other departments will be added. Unemployed workers in the city who pass the examination of the institute can be admitted, but only food and lodging will be provided, without additional salary. Most of the staff will be concurrently managed by the staff of the Social Affairs Bureau to save expenses. Other full-time staff who must be hired will also be those who are willing to fulfill their obligations as a principle.</p>
<h3>Reduced Repair Costs</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Civilian Factory believes that providing relief to unemployed workers in the war zone cannot be delayed. Therefore, a meeting was convened this morning to discuss reducing renovation costs and various progress plans. Zhang Zhenyuan, Chen Lengseng, Wang Gang, Chen Baohua, Qin Hongji, and other five members attended the meeting. As a result of the discussion, because the Civilian Residence buildings in Gaojing Temple were poorly constructed, many were blown down during the previous storm. Therefore, major repairs were needed. The Municipal Public Works Bureau estimated that the renovation would cost more than 6,000 yuan. However, due to limited funds, it was decided to reduce it to 3,000 yuan, and repair one-third of the Civilian Residence buildings first. The rest will be expanded after raising additional funds. However, the area is all muddy land, and it is difficult to walk after heavy rain. It is also necessary to find ways to add coal ash. Therefore, it is too late to start construction this year, and it must be postponed to February or March of next spring before it can be opened.</p>
<h3>Hu Xialian's Embezzlement Case Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Tong He, a Shandong woman, 41 years old, currently resides at No. 17 Shijian Tou, Huazhan Wharf, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Pudong. Her husband, Tong Guogui, worked as a tea servant on the Xinkang ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Northern Shipping Line. In July of the 18th year, when the Xinkang was sunk by a Japanese ship, Tong also died in the disaster. Hu Xialian, a Shandong native who worked as a detective in Renchang Li, K’ai-tse-erh Road, French Concession, was Tong's sworn brother. After Tong's death, Hu accompanied Tong's wife, He, to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to negotiate. As a result, she received a pension of 500 yuan, which Hu also accompanied her to collect. Later, Hu kept the money in custody. The following year, in February, He, believing that her husband had died and she could not stay in Shanghai for long, planned to withdraw the money from Hu to return to her hometown. Hu told her that he had lent 200 yuan to his friend Wang Desheng, and he did not have the other 300 yuan on him. Moreover, as a woman, it would be inconvenient for her to carry a large sum of cash home. You are illiterate and don't know what's good for you, so you should go back first, and I will send the money to you on your behalf. Tong He trusted Hu as her husband's sworn brother and did not suspect any changes, believing him to be telling the truth. Therefore, she only withdrew a small amount of travel expenses and took her children back to her hometown, counting on Hu to send the money home so that she could rely on it to live on. Unexpectedly, after arriving home, she waited a long time but did not see Hu send the money. So she sent a letter to Hu to inquire, but Hu ignored her and did not reply. In May of this year, she had no choice but to bring her children to Shanghai to ask Hu for the money. Hu initially hesitated, but then denied keeping it on her behalf, trying to embezzle it, causing a dispute and quarrel. After mediation failed, He hired lawyer Yang Zhihao to file a criminal self-lawsuit with the Second Special Court, accusing Hu of embezzlement and attaching a civil lawsuit to recover 429 yuan in pension. According to the complaint, the court has summoned the defendant Hu Erlian several times, who claimed that the money had been repaid because the plaintiff's husband owed a debt to the Hui organization while he was in Japan. The court ordered a further hearing after summoning witnesses. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Qiu summoned both parties and several witnesses, including Xiao Wuzi, for a continued hearing in the Second Criminal Court. After detailed inquiry, he announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 12th.</p>
<h3>The Water Outage Dispute in Bolu and Other Neighborhoods is Becoming More Serious; The Lives of More Than 2,000 Residents are in Danger</h3>
<p>Due to the increase in water costs after the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company implemented a water meter system for charging fees, the water costs have exceeded more than 30% of the rent. The owners of the buildings in Bolu Li, Bofu Li, Boshou Li, three male houses, and more than two hundred houses between Pingliang Road and Yangzhou Road in eastern Shanghai, are unable to bear this additional loss and have delayed payment. The water company removed the water meters in the three neighborhoods and cut off the water supply because they did not pay the water bill. The tenants of the neighborhood have repeatedly protested, opening up the fire hydrants in the neighborhood to maintain the water supply temporarily. Recently, the water company used coercive measures to close the fire hydrants, claiming that no water bills have been paid to date and that the fire hydrants have been open for several months, resulting in uncompensated losses. The tenants of the neighborhood panicked and jointly petitioned the owners, demanding that they pay the water bills and open the water supply to maintain their lives. They also opened the fire hydrants on the road themselves. At the same time, the owners reported to the Real Estate Association, requesting them to negotiate with the Municipal Council. Yesterday, the water company sent workers to close the fire hydrants on the road. The tenants became more panicked and negotiated with the owners again. The owners and the Real Estate Association petitioned the Municipal Council, requesting that the water company be instructed to open the water supply. Board Member He Dequi met them and listened to the opinions of the representatives, including Kui Yanfang. Board Member He then conveyed the information to General Manager Zhong Si, who said that if the water supply was to be opened, the owner must pay the water bill in full. Although Board Member Bao mediated and asked the owner to pay a certain amount first, with the remainder to be paid in installments, the General Manager insisted on not agreeing, resulting in a deadlock. The matter concerns the lives of more than a thousand people in the three neighborhoods and it is said that it has aroused serious resistance. They are requesting assistance from all walks of life to achieve the goal of opening the water supply.</p>
<h3>The Young Kidnapped Boy, Qie Bao, Died in the Bandit's Den; Zhang Shuchuan, the Main Culprit in This Case, Confessed in Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sun Yushun, a native of Shaoxing who lives at No. 115 Han’an Li, Ximen Road, French Concession, had his five-year-old only son, Qie Bao, suddenly disappear while playing in front of the door at noon on May 20th of this year. Initially, it was suspected that he had been abducted. Later, a letter arrived from the post office demanding 8,000 yuan in ransom before he would be released, and they knew that he had been kidnapped. After the French police investigated, they found that Zheng Wenxiang, a tenant of Sun from Shaoxing, was suspected of being heavily involved. When detectives were dispatched to arrest him, Zheng had already fled with his entire family. On August 14th, Zheng's wife, Zhou, concubine, Lou, Zheng's friend, Qiu Yaoshan, Zheng's apprentices, Li Ziqing and Min Xinting, and Min's lover, Zhou Wenying, were arrested in Room 516 of the Far East Hotel on Tibet Road. They were transferred to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. However, Zheng was still on the run and had not been arrested, so the case had not been concluded. On the morning of the 27th of last month, Inspector Jin Jiulin, the Director of the Special Agency of the French Police, and detectives arrested Zhang Shuchuan, also known as Da Kaizi, from Jiangbei Yancheng, from Run’an Li. He was handed over to the Second Special District Court for detention and investigation, and the case was combined with the previous arrests for trial. All the details were reported in this newspaper on the 29th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Li Changnian interrogated the case in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, explained the police's investigation process. Then, Zhang confessed that he had initiated the kidnapping alone and hid the child at Yu Dashunzi’s home at No. 121 Zhujiawan, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei. I wrote three letters to the plaintiff, and sent one to a letterbox. The first one told the owner not to worry, the child was safe. The second one demanded 8,000 yuan. The third one cut a piece of cloth from the child's clothes and sent it to the plaintiff as proof. The other four letters were not written by me. I only wrote the envelopes. The letters were written by Dong Zhiqing and his friend Zhang. I put these four letters in the postbox at Caojiadu. The child became ill after more than ten days. I gave him several doses of Huichun Dan, but it didn't work. He died on May 18th. I put the body in a wooden box, covered it with a hemp bag, and carried it to the Xiaobin River in Lujiazhai, Zhongshan Road. I was scared and didn't want the money, but Yu, Dong, and Zhang insisted on writing letters and demanding money. I didn't know anything about the money. At this point, the court gave Zhang paper and pen, ordered him to sit in the press seats, and copy the phrases in the letters for handwriting verification. After Zhang finished writing, the court ordered the six people who had been arrested earlier, including Qiu Yaoshan, to the dock and asked if they knew Zhang. They all replied that they did not know him. Then, the victim Sun Yushun stated that Zhang's father was in charge of Run’an Li, and Zhang had been sweeping the streets for several years. How could they not know each other? And before Qiu and the others were arrested, they had been seen talking at the entrance of the lane. Zhang cannot do this alone, and there must be accomplices who have not been arrested. He requested a thorough investigation and search for the child’s body. By this point, it was past noon. The court, believing that the facts of the case were unclear, and that there were many doubts, ordered a thorough investigation before scheduling another hearing. The defendants were returned to custody separately, and nearly twenty letters from the victim were handed over to the investigating detective for further investigation. During the trial, the child’s mother, Sun He, listened to Zhang's confession about her child's death from the sidelines, feeling heartache and shedding tears. As she left the court, she was helped by her relatives. Onlookers were saddened and heartbroken, and cursed the kidnappers as unscrupulous.</p>
<h3>Female Aviator Lin Pengxia Visited the Mongolian Border Exhibition; More Exciting Paintings Will Be Replaced Today; Mayor Wu Will Invite Celebrities to Visit</h3>
<p>The Mongolian Border Northwest Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai National Crisis Propaganda Group, has been held at the Municipal Public Education Hall for five days, causing a sensation far and wide. More than 150,000 people from Shanghai have visited in recent days. Yesterday, Huang Jingwan, a doctor of diplomacy, invited famous female aviator Lin Pengxia, Wu Mai, Wu Mulan, world female walker Liu Yunxian, and Northwest celebrities Sun Yatian and others to visit the exhibition. Shen Yiqian, the head of the group, personally greeted them, reported on the struggles after September 18th, and the recent situation in Inner Mongolia, and guided them through the entire exhibition. Ms. Lin was very satisfied with the group's work and specially wrote a poem to give to the group. The poem says, "A journey once revived Xia, Three households looked at the demise of Qin, Sincerity opens gold and stone, Where there is a will, there is a way." Ms. Lin has just returned from the Northwest and has the same experience as Mr. Shen of the group. They shared many insights during their conversation. Before leaving, Ms. Lin told the group members that she hoped to see them again in the Northwest in a month. They took a group photo together and left. The group has too much material for this exhibition, and it was unable to display it all in the previous days. Yesterday, it specially brought out more than a hundred pieces of elite works that had not been displayed and replaced part of the first and third exhibition halls. The most brilliant of them is the satirical painting, which is profound and unprecedented. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor and supporter of the group, and Du Yuesheng and Shi Liangcai, the initiators, will also invite celebrities from all walks of life to visit the exhibition during the exhibition to observe the actual situation in Inner Mongolia and promote it to the citizens.</p>
<h3>The Fourth District Public Security Bureau Seized a Large Batch of Bullets and Investigated Their Origin</h3>
<p>Nie Dexiang and other police chiefs from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, were previously ordered to search for flower clubs in Guangling Temple, behind Tongde Copper Shop at No. 177 Chang’an Road. Unexpectedly, a large batch of bullets were found next to the courtyard behind the copper shop. They were immediately taken into custody in the district. It is now learned that after investigation, the bullets were indeed purchased by Bao Sheng, who lives at No. 459 Guangfu Road and runs Hengfa Tai Old Goods Shop, from a British military barracks in the concession, and then sold to Ji Baosheng of Tongde Copper Shop at a price of 18 yuan per 100 jin, totaling more than 300 jin. It is said that the bullets were used by British soldiers for target practice and have been certified by the British military authorities. Therefore, Ji Renhe, who was arrested, was immediately released on bail. However, the bullets are still in the Fourth District. The District Chief believes that although the copper shop bought the bullets for the purpose of melting them down for profit and there were no other illegal acts, the case concerns the purchase of military supplies, so it has been reported to Director Wen Hongen for instructions.</p>
<h3>A Speeding Cart Crashed and Killed a Woman, Crushing Zhang Wenjiang's Left Arm</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenjiang, 25 years old, works as a shop assistant at the Chenbao Daily on Wangping Street. Yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM, Zhang was riding in a rickshaw when he passed the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road. The rickshaw tire became stuck in the tram tracks. While he was trying to get it out, a cart from Guo Zhengji Cart Company, number 381, came speeding towards him, knocking Zhang to the ground and crushing his left arm, causing him to bleed profusely. At the same time, an elderly woman, Shen Wang, 44 years old, was also knocked to the ground, injuring her abdomen and head. Police officers from Post Nos. 2548 and 847 saw this and sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the woman's injuries were too severe and the medical treatment was ineffective. She died at about 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Wilson Orchestra Arrives in Shanghai; The Paramount Hotel Will Open</h3>

<h3>Zhu Qinglan Resting from Old Illness</h3>
<p>General Zhu Ziqiao has been working tirelessly to relieve disaster relief efforts. Recently, due to a lack of rest time, his old hernia illness was triggered. Therefore, he is currently resting and recuperating and will recover soon.</p>
<h3>Two Charity Groups Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday; Xu Shiying, Wen Lantao and More Than Ten Others Attended; Approved the Yellow River Disaster Relief and Refugee Resettlement Cases</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Charity Groups in this city for Yellow River Flood Relief and the Northeast Refugee Association, were informed of the situation of the on-site investigation and disaster relief efforts by Changwei Qu Wenliu, who returned to Shanghai. Therefore, a temporary joint meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road. Commissioners Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Huang Bodu, Wu Zhihao, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lantao, Qian Jingping, Zhang Xiaolin (representing Jiang Zuozhou), Zhu Qinglan (representing Cha Liangzhao), Li Zicai, Wang Peiyuan, Guan Jiongzhi, and more than ten others attended. Tian Jiongjin, a member of the Supervisory Yuan, and Guo Weiping, a representative of the Gansu Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, were present. Xu Shiying was elected chairman.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Urgent Relief</h3>
<p>After the formalities were completed, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting. Immediately afterwards, the following proposals were discussed: (1) An urgent telegram from Ma Zuwu and others, investigators from Changyuan, reported that there were as many as 31 breaches in the county, with the flooded area exceeding 90%, affecting as many as 300,000 people. They were desperately in need of food, and the meager funds were insufficient for distribution. They earnestly requested additional relief funds and instructions. Another telegram stated that the disaster in Changpu and East Three Counties was enormous, with over 260,000 people on the brink of starvation. Many were suffering from malaria and festering sores, and they pleaded for increased relief funds, medicine, and clothing, the more the better, to provide assistance. (2) A document from Ma Xiuyi, a representative of the Shandong flood victims and chairman of the Shandong Poor People's Relief Association, stated that this year's Yellow River breach had turned the western part of Shandong into a swamp. With the severe winter fast approaching, the suffering from cold and hunger was unbearable. They specifically requested a sum of charitable funds to be allocated to their association, which would be responsible for selecting the most needy for relief, benefiting the disaster-stricken people. (3) A document from Tian Jiongjin and others, representatives of the Gansu Provincial Relief Association stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, stated that the province had suffered from years of famine, and its vitality was already depleted. This year, it was hit by floods again, affecting over 30 counties. Countless people and livestock drowned, and houses were submerged. The miserable cries of the refugees, faced with the severe winter, crying from hunger and cold, were especially unbearable to witness. Special representatives were sent to Beijing and Shanghai to appeal, requesting the allocation of 100,000 yuan to be directly remitted to Lanzhou, and the dispatch of personnel to assist and guide relief efforts. (4) Zhu Shaoliang and Zhu Jingzhou of Lanzhou sent a telegram stating that Gansu was located on the frontier and was historically poor. Unfortunately, since autumn, continuous rain had caused disasters, and mountain floods had erupted, causing severe damage. The urgent relief funds spent had reached over 300,000 yuan. The central government had not allocated a single cent, and charitable organizations in other provinces had not paid attention due to the distance. At this time of severe winter, with no clothes and no food, the sound of crying from hunger and cold could be heard everywhere, which was unbearable. They dared to ask for compassion, and immediate assistance, and to plead with the central government to allocate funds for urgent relief. (The above resolutions are temporarily confidential)</p>
<h3>Northeast Refugees</h3>
<p>After the discussion was completed, the Northeast refugee meeting proposal was discussed. The families of various generals under Commander Wang Delin had sought refuge in Shanghai since April. The association, in conjunction with related groups, had set up a place to receive them. Except for those who had homes to return to, who had been provided with travel expenses, there were still over 110 people living in the residence. However, various related groups had already been closed down one after another, and the association's relief funds were also running out. A good way to deal with it should be decided publicly. (The above resolutions are temporarily confidential.) The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>The exorbitant fees charged by the telephone company in Pudong prompt opposition from telephone users, who demand uniformity with the urban area and the elimination of water line fees</h3>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that after the Pudong Telephone Bureau announced its rates (12 yuan for residential, 15 yuan for commercial, 5 yuan more than Nanshi due to water lines), Pudong users collectively protested, arguing that the water lines were the Bureau's business tool (commonly known as "making money"). There is no precedent in the world for charging customers for the cost of generating income, and it is also unfair to single out Pudong users to bear this monthly water line maintenance fee of 5 yuan. Furthermore, communication with the Chinese concession is restricted, with an additional charge of 5 cents for each call exceeding the limit, while a 5 yuan maintenance fee for communication with the Chinese concession is also collected when applying for installation. All these charges seem almost ingenious. The existence of telephones in Pudong was the result of a proposal made by the representatives of the Five Districts Conference in the spring of the 18th year of the Republic to promote the prosperity of Pudong, requesting the Ministry to establish the Pudong Telephone Bureau. The Bureau has been completed for three years, but it only formally opened at the end of last month due to water line negotiations. Now, the high fees make it unaffordable for the public to apply for installation, which not only directly affects the development of the Bureau's business, but also indirectly hinders the prosperity of the Pudong market. It is reported that the Pudong Chamber of Commerce, the Fifth District Party Headquarters, and others have successively petitioned higher authorities to forward their requests to the Ministry to revise the Pudong telephone rates, to make them uniform with the urban area, to reduce the burden on the public, and to accelerate the prosperity of Pudong.</p>
<h3>Anqing Guangcheng Embankment telegraphs for dike repairs</h3>
<p>The China济生 Association recently received a telegram from Cao Qingquan, Chen Rongcheng and other representatives of the disaster victims of Guangcheng Embankment, Haikou Zhou, outside the west gate of Anqing, stating: "The Guangcheng Embankment outside the west gate of Anqing surrounds more than ten li of Zhoujia fields, covering an area of more than 30,000 mu and nearly 10,000 disaster victims. In three years, it has collapsed twice, sweeping away everything, leaving a desolate scene. In the 20th year of the Republic, the National Government's Flood Relief Committee repaired the Yangtze River embankment and allocated American wheat to subsidize the northern embankment. Before the wounds could heal, how could we endure another flood disaster? It is estimated that this collapse will require about 120,000 cubic meters of earthwork, with each cubic meter subsidized with 5 jiao for the disaster labor's food, which cannot be done without 60,000 yuan. The disaster victims are unable to save themselves, and they are really unable to repair it. At this time of winter weather, if we do not start work early, the spring floods next year will inevitably turn it into a swamp again, leaving only starving corpses. We pace around the room, at a loss. Your esteemed association previously borrowed money to start the Henan Minsheng Canal, and also raised funds to repair the Guangfeng Embankment in Jiangxi. Your benevolence has spread far and wide, and everyone admires you. Our embankment is located on the Yangtze River, close to Wan Yuan. Its rise and fall are closely related to the prosperity and decline of Anqing City and the well-being of the whole embankment. We have always admired your association's compassion and concern for those in distress. We are sure you will grant our request. We cannot help but look forward to it." It is noted that the association's relief funds have been greatly reduced in recent years, and the old Fushun Silver Company loan organization, with its scattered charitable comrades, is unable to borrow or allocate funds for the Guangcheng Embankment in Anqing. It can only sigh in vain. However, the embankment is of great importance to the people's livelihood in Wan Yuan, and once winter passes, the spring floods will surge. Even with huge funds, it will be too late to work, and the million mu of fields within the embankment will be impossible to cultivate, and ten thousand people will become starving corpses, which is truly tragic. It is hoped that people with lofty aspirations will make great wishes and accomplish this good deed to save the people's livelihood. The merit and virtue of this are immeasurable.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways stipulates that the charging method for chartered cars crossing the river will be calculated in accordance with Articles 32 and 33 of the Passenger Transport Regulations</h3>
<p>Regarding the calculation method of the cost of passengers reserving first, second, and third class carriages to cross the river, the Ministry of Railways yesterday specially telegraphed the administrations of the two railways to comply with it. The original text is extracted and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>For the Beijing-Hankou, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Ningbo Railway Bureaus: Regarding the case of the Beining Railway inquiring about the cost of chartered cars transporting Dong Feng across the river, it is found that the so-called chartered car refers to the first, second, and third class passenger cars exclusively reserved by passengers, and the chartered flower cars, chartered cars, or small chartered cars. After separate review and approval, if it is a first, second, or third class passenger car for exclusive use, the river crossing fee for the first part of the car should be charged in accordance with the provisions of Article 32 of the Passenger Transport Regulations promulgated by the Ministry. For example, each first class passenger car must purchase at least 20 first class tickets, and the passenger river crossing fee should also be calculated based on at least 20 first class tickets. The remaining second and third classes should be handled separately in accordance with the provisions of that article. If the chartered car is a flower car, chartered car, or small chartered car, etc., and the number of passengers is sufficient to meet the number stipulated in that article, the original price and passenger river crossing fee should be charged separately with reference to the above method and level, but no additional car rental will be charged. If the number of passengers is less than the number stipulated in Article 32, in addition to the passenger river crossing fee being charged according to the number of passengers, a car rental fee for crossing the river should be charged with reference to the chartered car type and the types stipulated by each road, calculated in 10 kg units. In addition to the separate telegram, you should comply with it immediately. Minister Gu Mengyu (seal)</p>
<h3>Passenger Transport Regulations</h3>
<p>Attached is the original text of Article 32 of the Passenger Transport Regulations: The minimum number of passenger tickets that should be purchased for reserved vehicles, regardless of the type of vehicle reserved, is a minimum of 35 yuan per car. Each first class passenger car must purchase at least 20 first class tickets, each second class passenger car must purchase at least 35 second class tickets, each third class passenger car must purchase at least 50 third class tickets, and each mixed car must purchase at least half the number of passenger tickets of each class as previously stipulated. Also, the original text of Article 33 of the Passenger Transport Regulations: The rental fees for chartered cars and flower cars are as follows: (1) Flower car: 3 jiao 5 fen per kilometer, with a minimum of 50 yuan; (2) Chartered car: 2 jiao 5 fen per kilometer, with a minimum of 35 yuan; (3) Small chartered car: 1 jiao 5 fen per kilometer, with a minimum of 20 yuan. In addition to the above car rental fees, passengers still pay fares according to the number of people and calculated at the first class rate, and servants pay fares according to the number of people and calculated at the second class rate. All existing equipment in the car is not charged separately, but those attached to special express trains should pay the additional special express train fee according to the number of passenger tickets.</p>
<h3>After the dye industry's wine money issue was resolved, disputes arose again when it was time to collect it</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Cloth Dyeing Industry Office previously had a labor strike due to the employer's breach of the wine money contract. Fortunately, it was resolved through the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the situation returned to normal. Now that it is time for the workers to collect the wine money, the employers suddenly violated the previous agreement and established a new standard for the wine money price, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers and a work stoppage, and the situation is likely to repeat itself. Yesterday, the office issued a declaration on this matter, stating: "Our office and others previously opposed the violation of the wine money price list signed by the Municipal Government's Bureau of Agriculture and Commerce 16 years ago by the dyeing industry employers, depriving all workers and employees of the rights stipulated in the contract, which led to the incident of refusing to dye goods. This was mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the results were: (1) The wine money for silk and cloth dyeing workshops should be strictly implemented by the employers in accordance with the wine money price list signed by the Bureau of Agriculture and Commerce before the 16th year of the Republic. (2) The above-mentioned wine money should be collected by the labor union from the workshops between the 5th and 9th of each month, and paid to the employees immediately. A contract guaranteeing the wine money was also signed by the employers to ensure their good faith. At the same time, the new product crepe long code restrictions were also supplemented. The negotiations had just ended when the price standard was suddenly changed, deceiving and changing, violating the law, and breaking the contract. If it is not corrected immediately, it will incite extremes, and a dye refusal storm will soon be seen. All losses should be borne by the employers. This is specially declared."</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Bar Association is approved to use regular paper for non-litigation matters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Judicial Administration regarding whether the regulations of judicial stamp paper rule six applied to documents used in non-litigation events that would require stamp duty: "In investigations concerning non-litigation affairs brought before the courts, it is found that there are no defined legal provisions to rely on regarding the documents used. Consequently, considering the current facts, some use the Department-issued judicial paper, while others affix a judicial stamp paper of one corner, in accordance with rule six of the Judicial Stamp Paper Regulations. The approach has not been uniform from the beginning, and there is often confusion about which to follow. However, if one applies Article One of the Judicial Stamp Paper Regulations, which states, 'For civil or criminal litigation, unless verbal communication is permitted by law, judicial stamp paper must be used,' it is clear that matters designated as 'non-litigation' do not fall under the scope of litigation. According to the aforementioned article, there is no need to purchase judicial stamp paper. Furthermore, Article Six of the Judicial Stamp Paper Regulations states, 'For submitting documents to judicial organs, those that should use Department-issued paper according to the rules of litigation stamp paper are not required to affix judicial stamp paper; all others must affix judicial stamp paper.' It is apparent from these rules that litigation documents should use Department-issued paper, while other documents submitted to judicial organs should affix a judicial stamp paper of one corner. Given that non-litigation events are not governed by the litigation stamp paper regulations, they naturally fall under the category that requires affixing judicial stamp paper. In summary, it is clear beyond doubt that documents presented to judicial organs in connection with non-litigation events are subject to rule six of the Judicial Stamp Paper Regulations, which requires affixing a one-corner stamp. However, at present, lower-level judicial organs sometimes require people seeking redress for non-litigation matters to purchase Department-issued paper, which has no basis in the codified rules and regulations, and is a result of not fully grasping the application of judicial paper regulations and judicial stamp paper regulations. Moreover, if one must purchase Department-issued paper to file a non-litigation case, then all documents filed with judicial organs must be uniformly required to use Department-issued paper. In that case, rule six of the Judicial Stamp Paper Regulations would be redundant. However, at present, procedures for non-litigation cases differ, and there is no clear consensus. Without a clear explanation from the Ministry, it will be impossible to achieve uniformity. Therefore, we request that the Ministry clarify whether rule six of the Judicial Stamp Paper Regulations applies to documents used in non-litigation cases, requiring affixation of a one-corner stamp, so that we may comply accordingly. We eagerly await instructions.” It is now known that the Ministry of Judicial Administration has issued the following instruction: "Noted. Petitions regarding non-litigation matters do not require the purchase of stamp paper. However, a filing fee must be paid, and stamp paper must be affixed in accordance with Rule Six of the Judicial Stamp Paper Regulations. Notify accordingly." This approval.</p>

The marine police got the news and captured them at Songkou. After interrogating the team, they were escorted to Nantong yesterday morning to be investigated.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry awards a certificate to the Sino-French Pharmacy</h3>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I was surprised to read in the second section of your November 24th issue that members of the Provincial 指委陣耀焜 and Wang Huaijin had sworn to leave the party. I am not talented, but I have been running around and serving the party and the country for 20 years. When the Fujian Incident occurred, the environment had already shown to be adverse. I could only close my door, feel heartbroken and sigh, this is something that gods and men could share, how would I get involved in a fake scenario and declare leaving the party, destroying my own history, abandoning the righteous for the fake, and degrade my character? I believe this is a factual error in the reporting, I have already escaped danger and arrived in Shanghai yesterday, I specially send a letter requesting you to correct the error and avoid confusing rumors, addressed to the head writer of Shenbao, Wang Huaijin, December 5th.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I was shocked to read in your second issue that I attended the Fuling Fellow Association in Shanghai. I am a merchant in Shanghai and have never participated in any social organization, fearing that the report is factually incorrect, so I especially write to request a correction, and ask for it to be published in your newspaper's correction section, addressed to the editorial department of Shenbao, Li Yingzhou, December 4th, 22.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>The Two-Wheeled Class and the Four-Wheeled Class</h3>
<p>— Qian Renkang</p>
<p>Shanghai's status as a metropolis stems from many factors, but it could not be so prosperous without bustling roads laid out in a crisscross pattern. The hustle and bustle of the roads is largely due to the embellishment of various vehicles. Among these vehicles, the more prestigious are naturally automobiles and private rickshaws.</p>
<p>Everything has "classes" these days, so let's tentatively call the gentlemen who ride private rickshaws the "two-wheeled class" and the gentlemen who ride automobiles the "four-wheeled class."</p>
<p>Whether it's the "two-wheeled class" or the "four-wheeled class," everyone has a rickshaw puller or chauffeur. The rickshaw puller has to also serve as the driving force for the carriage, naturally suffering much more in life than the chauffeur, and their status is far below that of the chauffeur. Not only below the chauffeur, but below all the drivers. Not only below all the drivers, but some even consider them below the livestock. Because their rickshaws not only carry people, but sometimes the people in the rickshaw also bring a 巴哈 dog. As for the other drivers, their status is naturally much higher. The spirited chauffeur goes without saying, and even the carriage driver who spends all day with animals can still occasionally raise his whip to strike the horse's back a few times, his status certainly not below the livestock.</p>
<p>In this case, the "two-wheeled class" who ride private rickshaws are clearly not very "humane," and the most imposing, most humane, and most "civilized" are naturally the "four-wheeled class" who ride automobiles. Many gentlemen have risen from the "two-wheeled class" to the "four-wheeled class," probably for this reason? Look at the blaring horns, everyone avoids them; like lightning, they speed along freely, truly powerful and influential! However, they sometimes inevitably get cursed as "市虎," probably because they occasionally run over a few people. But the reason people get run over, it is said, is because "one" is not careful. The automobile itself is still very "civilized" and very "humane"!</p>
<h3>The Swinification of Life</h3>
<p>— Zhou Limin</p>
<p>"Outlook on life" is an abstract term, quite philosophical, with broad and deep meaning. In a narrow sense, it refers to people's way of life, their attitude towards the world, and the concepts they hold. Whether they are optimistic, pessimistic, enlightened, or ×-istic, in short, each person has their own outlook on life, as different as their faces. "Pig," "pighead," "fat pig," "×-pig," these are nicknames for people who are mere clothes hangers and refuse collectors, and also insults for a generation of talentless people.</p>
<p>Isn't this abuse of the word "pig"? If pigs had knowledge, they would surely cry injustice! No, absolutely not; everyone knows that the life of a pig is extremely simple, with no particular pig-life outlook. Here are six ways to encompass it:</p>
<p>First way: Eat... sleep... excrete.</p>
<p>Second way: Sleep... eat... excrete.</p>
<p>Third way: Excrete... sleep... eat.</p>
<p>Fourth way: Eat... excrete... sleep.</p>
<p>Fifth way: Sleep... excrete... eat.</p>
<p>Sixth way: Excrete... eat... sleep.</p>
<p>The life of a pig is nothing more than this. Besides this, there is no concept of diligence, no sense of responsibility to do one's best, exert oneself to the utmost, and die only after one's task is done. Perhaps the pig's so-called pig-life outlook is just like that?</p>
<p>I believe that the unemployed vagrants who rely on their ancestors' inheritance, who only know how to divide profits but cannot generate them, are nothing more than sleeping, eating, and excreting. Besides this, they do nothing all year round. Such people are superficially "people," but they hold a pig-life outlook. Isn't that lamentable?</p>
<h3>The Legless Crab and the Seedless Date</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>These are two interesting stories that seem to be comparable, so I will now narrate them.</p>
<p>There was a man surnamed Xie who was a prefect in a certain province during the Qing Dynasty. He was extremely snobbish. His brother-in-law was a low-ranking official who came to the province to seek promotion. Xie looked down on his brother-in-law because his official position was too humble. One day, Xie invited many famous officials to admire chrysanthemums and drink wine. His brother-in-law thought this was a good opportunity to meet those important people and use it as a stepping stone for advancement. However, Xie strongly disapproved, fearing that the lowly rank would affect his own reputation. Somehow, his wife found out and complained to him. Xie had no choice but to invite his brother-in-law to attend. Unexpectedly, the brother-in-law's conversation was elegant, and his social skills were sophisticated, which earned him the praise of those famous officials. Xie was very jealous. Later, during the wine game of couplets, Xie used this to mock him, saying, "The kowtowing bug always stays beneath people." His brother-in-law was very quick-witted and immediately replied, "The legless crab should not flaunt its abilities." Xie's use of "legless" for the word "crab" was extremely clever.</p>
<p>During Zhang Changtui's era, a certain county magistrate surnamed Zhang in Shandong misappropriated tens of thousands of taels of public funds. He was a skilled flatterer. Previously, he had been a clerk in a certain office. One day, Zhang and the chief of the office went to the home of a director for a banquet. The director happened to bring out honey dates to serve the guests. The chief ate one and praised the date as seedless. He then picked one and gave it to Zhang. Zhang ate the date and found a seed, which he swallowed forcefully. The chief asked him how it was. Zhang said the date was seedless and a wonderful variety. The chief urged him to eat another, so he ate several in succession. The date seeds nearly blocked his throat. The chief asked the director where these dates came from and why they were seedless. The director said, "These are ordinary dates, how could they be seedless?" The chief looked at Zhang. Zhang said unnaturally, "There are sometimes seeds." The chief said, "Why haven't I seen you spit out any seeds?" Zhang was ashamed and had no reply. It became a laughingstock for a time.</p>
<h3>Green Tangerines</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yan</p>
<p>Occasionally, I glimpsed a few green tangerines on a hawker's fruit stall in the market. Their round, green, and shiny forms pierced my eyes, and then they stirred the strings of my broken heart.</p>
<p>In principle, these many unripe green tangerines should still be nurtured in the orchard: caressed by the sunlight, nourished by fertilizer, and irrigated with clean water! They shouldn't be displayed in the market for sale so early. But that cruel gardener, only seeking his own benefit, disregards whether you are ripe or not, tearing you raw from the branches, making you a tool for his own profit. Preventing you from ever having the chance to develop sweet juice.</p>
<p>Ah! My fate as a wanderer, isn't it the same as those unfortunate green tangerines? Overwhelming economic obstacles force young people who should still be pursuing further education in school to abandon their books midway, shatter their dreams, and sacrifice their future, entering society as beasts of burden with tears in their eyes. But his essence was originally immature, all he has is barrenness and astringency! From then on, he has no blessing to receive the warmth of the gentle sun, the cultivation of fertilizer and water. He will never turn into a moving golden color, brewing rich and sweet juice. He can only longingly envy his lucky companions, advancing towards the path of success, while he himself is forever foolish, impoverished, and astringent! The final result is nothing more than being abandoned on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Green tangerines! You suffer at the hands of a greedy gardener, being picked before your essence is ripe. I am trapped by the evil money, applying knowledge to the world before my knowledge is enriched. I deeply sympathize with you, pity you. Ah! You are the symbol of my destiny!</p>
<p>Brief News: Young writer Ge Chonglou has recently finished writing a full-length novel, "Tragedy in Loneliness, Collection Two," which depicts the emotional distress of modern youth. It has now been published! It is available at Kaiming, Modern, Datong, and other bookstores.</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<h3>The Most Peculiar Will</h3>
<p>This is the most peculiar will in the world. In the Warsaw region, a Polish man, on his deathbed, said that his radio set should be placed in his coffin after his death, with the earpieces placed on his ears. His pipe, four pounds of tobacco, and a round round (toy) were all his beloved objects and should also be placed inside the coffin.</p>
<h3>Decrease in Millionaires</h3>
<p>In the Netherlands, the number of millionaires in 1931 decreased by 249 compared to last year. Whether the economic recession is affecting the Netherlands has become a question. Last year's statistics showed that the Netherlands had a total of 1,057 millionaires, but in 1931, there were 1,306. Their total assets have decreased from 2,931,000,000 yuan to 2,323,000,000 yuan. At the same time, the total salaries paid nationally have also decreased from 4,367,000弗路林 to 4,206,000,000弗路林. The total tax revenue in the Netherlands has also decreased from 15,623,000,000 to 14,300,000,000弗路林.</p>
<h3>Brave Woman</h3>
<p>A special express train, carrying many passengers and luggage, was traveling on the railway. The driver did not pay attention, but the bridge ahead had recently collapsed, and it would be dangerous to drive over it. However, he suddenly saw a red shawl spread on the railway, it was an Indian woman's garment, and several women stood at both ends of the shawl. So he pulled the emergency brakes several times, very urgently, but those women did not move at all, resulting in him having to stop the train. But the place where the train stopped was only a few yards away from the collapsed bridge. The incident occurred in Mumbai, India.</p>
<h3>American Highways</h3>
<p>In the United States, the length of plateau roads will soon reach three million miles. At the end of 1932, the length of plateau roads passable by automobiles was 875,000 miles, of which 275,000 miles were provincial roads. The total length of plateau roads in the United States is now 3,040,000 miles, of which 360,000 miles are provincial roads and 2,680,000 miles are national roads. Among the provincial roads, there are also 200,000 miles of interesting plateau roads.</p>
<h3>New Pigeon Record</h3>
<p>In Odessa, Russia, a homing pigeon flew home from afar, covering a distance of 1,300 miles. This pigeon was sold twice in Moscow and bought back home by a pigeon lover. Both times, it flew back home. According to the original owner, this pigeon has probably broken the world record.</p>
<h3>Dog that Delivers Mail</h3>
<p>A German dog, whose original owner is unknown. He has recently been guarding the post office door for his owner, Lines, who is an experienced postman. Every day, he carries letters and runs to Southern Sudan 波丹 twice. Years ago, this dog always followed him twice a day. But Lines recently reached the age limit and retired. However, this journey is an important thing in the dog's life. Therefore, although he explained the reason to the dog, the dog always guards the door of the post office, refusing to go with the new owner.</p>
<h3>Banana Promotion</h3>
<p>The propaganda of the German National Socialist Party is prohibited in Austria. However, a strange incident occurred here where bananas were used as propaganda items. After a ship of fresh fruit arrived in Vienna, it was distributed to merchants throughout the city. Who knew that every banana was printed with the Hitlerized symbol, which is forbidden in Austria. The police began to intervene. Although sales were still permitted, public display on fruit stalls was not allowed. They also took photos as evidence.</p>
<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Anfu</p>
<p>If all the private courage of China could be collected and united against foreign enemies, I believe his cause would be greater than Napoleon's.</p>
<p>The most precious thing in the world is sympathy, because it is the only thing that cannot be bought with money or forced with power.</p>
<p>When emotions are extremely agitated, if you can use a calm mind to consider it carefully, this will be your most reliable judgment.</p>
<p>A person whose reason outweighs emotion is just an ordinary person; only a person whose emotion outweighs reason can become a transcendent villain or a good person.</p>
<h3>The Northeastern Four Company Commanders, Episode 19</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Desiring to Leave and Then Desiring to Stay, Remembering the Past in the Same Carriage; Half-Crying and Half-Laughing, Leaning on a Pillow in the Sickly, 残秋</p>
<p>Guizhi admired the chrysanthemums for a while, feeling a chill on her body, and walked back into the house. Unexpectedly, at that time, she only cared about looking at the chrysanthemums and forgot that she was wearing a thin cloth jacket. After entering the room, when she went to find clothes to add to keep warm, she already felt a little tired. Gradually, her mind became dizzy, and she caught a cold. When a person is so upset that there is nothing they can do, they are very likely to want to sleep. Since she was feeling unwell, she might as well go to bed. She spread out the bedding, piled the pillow high, and leaned her body against it, only covering the lower half of her body with the quilt. Her face was half-turned, and her eyes slowly closed. Jiang was working in the outer room and didn't pay attention. For half a day, she didn't hear any movement from the inner room, and she thought to herself that this child's character has been changing a lot lately. Sometimes she stands in the yard in a daze, sometimes she sits alone in the room propping her head and thinking foolishly, sometimes she sighs to herself. She would say a word or two to herself. What is all this for? At this time, she hasn't made a sound for a long time, maybe she's having another one of her moods. Jiang thought like this and stretched her head and looked inside through the crack in the door curtain. Guizhi's face was facing the door, and she saw it through the crack in the curtain, just a face looking back. Only her cheeks were red, showing two large round blushes, and there were two lines of tears flowing down the sides of her eyes. Jiang was startled when she saw this situation. What wronged her that she started crying? (260)</p>

<h3>Principal Xu of Beiping University Persistently Resigns</h3>
<p>(Beiping, 5th) Principal Xu Yongming of Beiping University is very firm in his intention to resign. Therefore, representatives Wu Xiangfeng and Liu Yunzhou went to Beijing to discuss the funding issues of Beiping University with the Ministry of Education.

According to those close to Xu, if the Ministry of Education can adopt Xu's opinions, there may be a turning point in his resignation.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Makes Concessions on the Unified Examination Methods; Students Who Fail in One or Two Subjects Will Be Temporarily Allowed to Advance</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, considering that various primary and secondary schools in various places have requested exemptions or modifications to the graduation examinations, has revised the regulations to make concessions based on the opinions of students and school authorities. The principles required for decision-making have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, according to the reporter of the Daily News, the graduation examinations were originally held to rectify the uneven levels of education. In recent years, the levels of secondary schools have varied the most, while primary schools are still relatively uniform. Looking at the results of this year's examinations, the Ministry has decided to change the method of calculating scores to accommodate the difficulties expressed by the school authorities. The proportions are as follows: graduation examination results account for 60%, and school graduation grades account for 40%. The graduation grades must be based on 60% for daily grades and 40% for graduation examinations. (2) Students who fail in three or more subjects will be required to repeat the grade. If they fail in one or two subjects, the examination committee will issue a certificate allowing them to advance temporarily. After passing the next examination, they will be given a diploma. Because holding make-up examinations in the same year for students who fail the graduation examination may hinder their entrance examinations, the make-up examination is abolished to facilitate advancement.</p>
<h3>Rural Education Society Sets Date for Establishment; General Assembly to Be Held in Qixia Rural Teachers' School Next January</h3>
<p>In recent years, my country's rural economy has been on the verge of bankruptcy. Tracing the source, it is due to the lack of knowledge among farmers and the failure to popularize education. Therefore, rural education is the only essential plan for developing the countryside. The Chinese Rural Education Society is organized by people in the country who are enthusiastic about rural education, with the aim of concentrating the strength of rural education colleagues across the country to jointly plan the development of the rural education movement. It has been approved and filed by the Central Party Department and the Ministry of Education. Details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, the society held its second preparatory meeting at the Nanjing YMCA. Attendees included Zhang Zhiwen, Tang Qiyu, Zhao Hongqian, Sun Fang, He Yushu (represented by Xu Rong), Xiang Jutan (represented by Zhao Hongqian), Huang Zhifu, Peng Baichuan, etc. The Central Party Department also had instructor Zhang Jiao present. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Zhiwen and recorded by Peng Baichuan. The following key cases were resolved: (1) Deciding the date for the establishment congress. It was decided that the establishment congress would be held on January 27th (Saturday), 23rd year of Republic, at the Qixia Rural Teachers' School in Nanjing Qixia County, Jiangsu Province. The congress will last for two days. (2) Soliciting members. It was decided that (1) letters would be sent to normal schools and rural teachers' schools in various provinces inviting them to join the society as group members, (2) each member should introduce at least one new member, (3) how to divide and cooperate in the preparatory work for the establishment congress. It was decided that (1) sending meeting notices (collecting membership fees), reprinting the society's constitution, printing election ballots, and preparing for food, lodging, and reception will be handled by Huang Zhifu and Li Shaoliang, (2) drafting plans and organizing proposals will be handled by Zhang Zhiwen and Tang Qiyu, (3) raising funds will be handled by Sun Fang and Zhao Hongqian, (4) preparing official documents requesting the Central Party Department and the Ministries of Education and Interior to send personnel to the meeting for guidance, and requesting the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways to approve fare reductions for transportation will be handled by Peng Baichuan.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Specialist Li Ximou Returns to Beijing After Inspection</h3>

<h3>Development of Film and Drama in Polish Culture</h3>
<p>A member of the China-Poland Cultural Association recently translated a detailed account of film and drama in Polish culture. Excerpts are provided below (the following is the translated text):</p>
<p>During the silent film era, the export of Polish films abroad was a rare occurrence. Only "The Tragedy of the Foreman" was screened in eight countries – Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the Netherlands – an exceptional case. Since the rise of sound films, the development of the Polish film industry abroad has been flourishing. Films like "The Orderly," "Ten Criminals and Two Musicians," "One Tenth of the Earth," "Hundred-Meter Love," and "For the Road" have been screened in countries such as Egypt, the United States, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, France, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Chile, Palestine, Spain, Latvia, and Estonia. Furthermore, the sale of film copyrights abroad is also common. For instance, "The Protection of the Holy Mother" was sold to the United States for 30,000 yuan. The new film "The Echo of Peace" is being filmed in the Tatra Mountains. The recording equipment, invented and manufactured in Poland, is portable, doesn't require electricity, and can be installed in an ordinary car, similar in form to those produced by Fox and Western Electric. The creator and inventor is Mr. "Berniard." According to the American Film Yearbook, in 1932, the United States imported a total of 198 films, of which nine were Polish, accounting for 5% of American film imports. This is truly commendable and makes us lament that Chinese films, except for those watched by overseas Chinese, have not yet developed abroad. Poland recently held a "National Polish Book Promotion Week," promoting to the middle class, farmers, workers, intellectuals, and in schools and the military. The first item on the agenda was a film screening, followed by book exhibitions, lectures, and parades, demonstrating the wide use and significant impact of film. In Yugoslavia, Polish dramas will be staged this season, including "Accident" by Rosworski and "The Monik Affair" by Sikorska.</p>
<p>Additionally, "The Lawyer" and "Roses" by Renli Ininski are scheduled for performance. The Baerograd Opera House has decided to stage the opera "Helga" by Polish composer Monisko. A theater in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is currently staging a play by a young Polish author titled "Female Doctor." The wife of the famous Czech playwright Shedechick is playing the lead role. The Warsaw National Theater commemorated the 100th anniversary of the first performance of "Revenge" by Count Freicher. This masterpiece by Freicher is still regarded by the Polish people as the ancestor of Polish drama, and the actors selected are all famous national stars, in celebration of this grand anniversary.</p>

<h3>Training Supervisory Department Intensifies National Military Training – City Committee Established, Actively Preparing and Proceeding – Scheduled to Convene Meetings of Military Instructors from Various Schools</h3>
<p>The National Military Training Committee has been organized and established, with four provinces including Hunan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu. The city's military training was also officially established on the 20th of last month at the old Shanghai County Office on Penglai Road, and has notified various schools accordingly. In the future, regarding the guidelines for national military training and practical training methods, meetings of military training instructors from various schools will be convened to discuss and respond to environmental needs. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Organization of the Committee</h3>
<p>According to the organizational regulations, the National Military Training Committee is directly supervised by the Training Supervisory Department and the Ministry of Education.

The chairman is He Chongti, and the full-time member is Wang Jingyi (both appointed by the Training Supervisory Department). The members Chen Bai and Du Gang (both appointed by the City Education Bureau) and Chen Zhiyi (appointed by the City Security Office) have also assumed their positions and are engaged in planning all military training matters in the city. All military training instructors in the city, who were previously under the direct command and supervision of the Training Supervisory Department, are now also transferred to this committee for unified management.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Committee Funds</h3>
<p>According to a discussion with Wang Jingyi, a full-time member of the city's military training committee, the salaries of the committee members are still paid separately by their original agencies. The salaries of the committee's staff and office expenses amount to approximately 400 yuan per month, which is allocated from the City Education Bureau's education funds. The salaries of the instructors at each school are still paid from the school's funds.</p>
<h3>Convening Instructor Meetings</h3>
<p>Wang also stated that since the committee was newly established, everything is in the initial stages. It is currently difficult to implement comprehensive training for all levels in the city's national military training. For now, training will be intensified in high schools and above, and other vocational groups will be planned within a possible scope. The implementation of military training is now scheduled to take place between the 10th and 12th of this month, convening a meeting of military training instructors from high schools and above in the city to determine the guidelines for military training and detailed regulations for various items that should be noted in the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to private schools at all levels in the city yesterday, stating: "It has been found that all school publications were previously ordered by this bureau to be submitted for review. Most of those submitted by various schools for review have not been registered, which is inconsistent with the publication law. The aforementioned publications are divided into two types: periodic and temporary. For periodic publications, in addition to submitting them to the Fourth Section of this bureau for record each period, they should first obtain a registration form from the municipal government in accordance with Article 7 of the Publication Law, attach the publication, fill it out in accordance with the form, and apply for registration.

<h3>New Outlets for Elementary School Students</h3>
<p>Recently, industry and commerce have been depressed, and various places have tightened their belts and are not employing more people.

Students who have been teaching elementary and junior high school students are at a loss, and the outlets are even narrower. Recently, the 22-story building of the Four Banks Savings Association will be completed soon. It is planned to open a large hotel, adopt the European and American system, and employ students from schools as staff to improve their personality. The Chinese Vocational Education Society is specially entrusted to train them, and dormitories, exercise fields, and classrooms are rented. The training period is only six months. After the training period, they will serve in the 22-story building of the association and receive generous subsidies.

On the same day, those who came to the port to welcome him included Dai's family, all the warriors and players of East China Sports, and more than 20 people. Dai is still in good shape, but a little thinner than before. It is said that the wind and waves were a bit heavy from Baca City to Hong Kong, which caused the ship to be delayed. He was unable to catch up with the East China vs. French Business War, which was a pity. He hopes that after returning to the mother team, he will work hard to follow the campaign in order to win the Shigaota Cup. It is reported that East China is scheduled to practice at the baseball field at 3:00 pm today in order to practice cooperation.

<h3>West Qing Basketball Women's Game Tonight – Three China Teams Will Play – Pirate Mailing Won Last Night –</h3>
<p>There are five women's basketball games tonight in West Qing, and the two Jiangnan and Southeast A and B teams will all play. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Liangjiang vs. Telephone 6:30 pm</p>
<p>(2) Southeast B vs. Green Team 7:15 pm</p>
<p>(3) Rainbow Team vs. Yellow Team 8:00 pm</p>
<p>(4) Elementary vs. Southeast A 8:45 pm</p>
<p>(5) Mailing vs. Basketball 9:30 pm</p>
<p>There were two men's games yesterday, (1) Pirates won Jiangwan, 30 to 21, (2) Mailing won Qingguang, 58 to 25. In terms of performance, Mailing's passing is fast, and both the snatching and shooting show skill. Before the A-team championship, there is endless hope. Pirates are afraid that it will be difficult to defend their title.</p>
<h3>Pirates Beat Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Jiangwan's actions were slow yesterday and failed to penetrate the basket. There was no improvement after the start. Pirate Carson White Knight was very active and frequently hit the ball. In the first half, he led by 16 to 7. The competition was more intense in the second half. After each scored two points, Jiangwan's Zhang Jinxiang shot a goal, and Zhao Butian scored one point from Smith's penalty. Then he hit the basket, and the Pirates committed a lot of violations, and suddenly became famous with 27 to 13. Jiangwan did not dare to neglect, Chen Zongqi and Zhang Jinxiang guarded the door tightly, and Zhao Butian, Zhou Dayun, and Qiu Guangxiu were able to concentrate on approaching. As a result, they lost 21 to 30. However, the first half of the game did not seem to be enough for the prescribed time.</p>

<p>First half Pirate Sixteen Jiangwan Seven Points</p>
<p>Second half Pirate Fourteen Jiangwan Fourteen</p>
<h3>Mailing Beat Qingguang</h3>
<p>Except for Lei Duo, Qingguang was unable to match the past due to his duties, spirit, and physical strength. The ball skills are still unrecognized, such as Wu Chunwu, etc., and the spirit is consistent throughout. After Chen Maiqiu came out to be the general, Wu Changbao was strong. After the war, Mailing Mao Lei Bixie Wan and others invaded one after another, leading by nine to zero. Qingguang started with Chen Hualu's penalty for one point. Qu Xianzhu, Wu Baoqiu, was awarded two more balls. Mailing used Xun's hug to pass the ball. Mao Lei once made achievements at the bottom of the basket. Chen Hualu scored two points again, and it became 7 to 14. Tan Dahuai showed his dryness and pushed the ball in with one hand. At the end of the first half, Qingguang trailed 16 to 26. After the break, Qingguang felt that his strength was not enough, so Mailing took the opportunity to break in. Except for Lu Daning's one goal, almost all of it was within Mailing's sphere of influence. Wu Chunwu and Chen Baoqiu were successively penalized off the field, and the situation became more and more unsustainable. Mailing finally won with 58 to 25.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first day of the third Public Exhibition Cup International Handball Tournament. Unfortunately, the Chinese team lost 1 to 4, so today's game is very important and must recover what was lost in order to win the championship of this round. Lu Jun in Group 9 was unfortunately defeated due to illness, which was very unfortunate. Yan Jun in Group 7 won the first game first, but unfortunately failed to seize the opportunity in the second game, resulting in two consecutive wins, and the Chinese team became unfavorable. Although Cheng Jun in Group 5 worked hard, he was unable to beat Ma in skill, so he was defeated.

<h3>West Light Cross-Country Team to Practice Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>The depths of autumn have passed, and the first month of winter has arrived. In this season between late autumn and early winter, our athletic heroes are in their prime. Since the West Light Cross-Country Team initiated the Shanghai-Huaian round trip long-distance run, the team members have become even more diligent, and their achievements are bound to improve. According to team captain Wu Chunyuan, the 7th of this month marks the anniversary of West Light's founding. The general practice, originally scheduled for every Sunday, will be held tomorrow morning in advance for commemorative purposes. All new and old team members are expected to gather in front of Minli Middle School before 6:00 AM to depart together.

<h3>"Great Use Cup" Final Set for 10 AM, Sunday</h3>
<p>Shanghai Great Use Rubber Co., Ltd., along with the municipal sports community, will award one "Great Use Cup," a trophy for the victors of the "Great Use Cup" small-field football competition. Because the competition committee has not been able to identify which of the nine "small football movement throughout the country" groups in the adult division will win the trophy, they have devised a plan to hold a final between the All-Black Team, which has won the adult division league championship many times and participated in this year's exhibition matches, and a mixed team consisting of the elite players from the adult division. The All-Black Team's small football skills have long been renowned in Shanghai. The mixed team will be based on the Zero Team, the championship team from the national adult division (the group with the highest level of skill), and will also select famous players from other teams, making it exceptionally strong. Therefore, the Great Use Cup final is a grand event for the small football community in Shanghai. The match is scheduled for 11:00 AM on Sunday, the 10th of this month.</p>

<h3>Progress of the Chinese Painting Exhibition in Paris (5)</h3>
<p>At 3 PM on May 10th, the opening ceremony of the Chinese Art Exhibition was held at the Musée du Jeu de Paume. First, our Minister to France, Mr. Gu, and the French Minister of Education, Mr. Monzie, jointly issued invitations, inviting all sectors of French society to participate in this grand event. On that day, among those present from our country were Minister Gu and his wife, Counselor Xiao, Secretary Xie, Consul General Li, representatives from the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, Chinese representative Liu Fucheng, and the organizers of the painting exhibition, including Xu Beihong, Zhang Fengju, and Liu Hou, as well as more than 200 male and female students. From France, there were the Minister of Education, the Undersecretary of Fine Arts, the directors of various museums, art inspectors, celebrities from all walks of life, newspaper reporters, and more than 2,000 artists, creating a lively and grand atmosphere, perhaps an unprecedented promotional event for the Chinese in France. The opening ceremony was very simple, with the organizers leading Minister Gu, Minister Monzie, and the attendees on a tour of the exhibition for about two hours before it concluded. They all praised the exhibition and expressed their admiration. Newspaper reporters scrambled to take photos, and flashes of light dazzled the eyes. The months of hard work that had gone into the exhibition seemed to vanish into thin air at that moment.</p>
<p>After the opening of the painting exhibition, the number of visitors was extremely high. The entrance fee was five francs per person, and more than 25,000 people purchased tickets. Chinese students and personnel from French art and education institutions were admitted free of charge. The exhibition catalog was sold for ten francs per copy, with a total of 3,000 copies sold. Therefore, the total revenue from tickets and catalogs was more than 120,000 francs. In 1929, the Japanese government also held a Japanese painting exhibition at the Musée du Jeu de Paume, but its revenue was only 100,000 francs. This time, our Chinese painting exhibition earned one-fifth more, and this was during a time of global economic panic, so the achievement is truly remarkable. However, the amount of revenue has nothing to do with us, as the museum was borrowed, and all revenue belongs to the French national treasury. All that we gain is the praise of the audience and the acclaim of the newspapers. At a time when our country is beset by internal and external troubles and the Japanese are spending heavily to buy public opinion and spread slanderous articles about the Chinese, this painting exhibition has made a positive impression on the general public, prompting them to say good things about us, which is of some small benefit to our nation.</p>
<p>The exhibition was originally scheduled to last for one month, but at the request of the audience, it was extended twice, for a total of 45 days. During this period, there were more than 200 articles in newspapers from various countries criticizing the painting exhibition, in English, Russian, German, Italian, and French. To save space and avoid repetition, we have selected and translated more than ten articles as a general overview. In addition, there are comments on the painting exhibition from other foreign newspapers.</p>
<p>Le Temps (May 12) published an article by Millet, which stated, "The survival of China is like the growth of a living being, which must suffer pain before it can develop. Therefore, its internal strife, famine, and invasion by others are precisely the stimulants for its thinkers, mystics, and artists. This has always been the case throughout history. Looking at the organization of its art exhibition, it is even harder for us to believe that this moving China has reached its final breath. In the midst of national difficulties, organizing a Chinese painting exhibition is an extremely difficult task, but Professor Xu Beihong of National Central University and Liu Hou of the Sino-French University were able to accomplish it swiftly. Such activities can only be achieved by a nation that can preserve its inherent spirit for generations."</p>
<p>Paris Weekly (May 12) published an article by Lu Haituo, which stated, "China is currently in a difficult period and cannot transport its ancient masterpieces to France, but its lively and attention-grabbing modern painting exhibition is already worthy of our admiration. The various styles and trends of Chinese painting are all represented here by works of extremely high value. (Omission) We should pay special respect to the modern works brought by Professor Xu Beihong of Central University. Mr. Xu is currently the most famous painter in China. We also cannot help but especially praise Gao Qifeng's sailing boat, Wang Yiting's fierce Da Hou, Chen Shuren, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, waterfall, and his peach blossom belt which makes one feel a sense of flow, Pan Tianshou's flower-carrying, and Ye Jiying's Lushan scenery. However, there are many such works, and we cannot help but forgive ourselves for not being able to mention them all in detail. (Omission)"</p>

<h3>The Negro Question</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Reading the recent newspapers makes me believe that there are extremely honest individuals among the news editors of Shanghai. For example, consider the following news item:</p>
<p>"Reuters, Baltimore, USA, 28th: On October 18th, a lynching of a Negro occurred in Maryland, USA. The governor sent a team of soldiers to the scene of the incident last night to arrest nine key suspects. However, local officials made excuses and delayed the process, resulting in the army only arresting three people. The difficulty of punishing lynchers in the United States is evident from this."</p>
<p>This is a common occurrence, but some newspapers have added headlines like "Lynching in the United States Too?" This implies that the United States is a civilized country and should not have lynching.</p>
<p>This is due to an overreliance on the superficial beauty of the term "civilized country." If we follow this logic, not only should lynching disappear, but discrimination against Negroes should also have ceased long ago. In the above news item, the persecution of Negroes is actually more significant than the act of lynching itself.</p>
<p>But this is not surprising either. In 1776, the United States declared the equality and freedom of all people, and in 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. However, these were all beautiful lies, and Negroes have yet to receive fair treatment. According to the so-called Jim Crow Laws in the southern states of the United States, special areas are designated in the back of streetcars and buses for Negroes to sit in. Even in schools and waiting rooms at parking lots, Negroes are not allowed to mix with whites. In theaters, Negroes who intrude into white seating areas are often subjected to "lynching."</p>
<p>Lynching Negroes is not considered a crime or a disgrace. American newspapers often publish such news with large headlines. The most brutal forms of lynching even involve piling up firewood and burning Negroes alive.</p>
<p>But neither these Negroes nor the Jews will disappear under the cruelty and oppression of civilized races. On the contrary, even the most compliant and gentle Negroes have developed racial and class consciousness and are waking up. Even white people themselves have realized that relying solely on "terror" tactics cannot prevent this race from ever rising again. Siegfried said, "Neither southward nor northward can we find a solution to this problem. The race problem plunges us into an abyss of terror." (America Comes of Age) According to one group of people, the problem can be solved only if Negroes make greater progress in society, white people can reflect, and then the two can move towards coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>But according to Scott Nearing, the liberation of Negroes in America can only be achieved if Negro working masses join hands and build a new social organization together.</p>
<p>Which view is correct, right and wrong, we can only wait for future events to prove.</p>
<h3>The Author of *Water Margin*</h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>The author of *Water Margin* is traditionally believed to be Shi Nai'an.</p>
<p>Shi Nai'an is a controversial figure. In Ming Dynasty scholar Lang Ying's *Qixiu Leigao*, *Water Margin* is attributed to Song Jiang and said to be compiled by Luo Ben Guanzhong of Hangzhou, but also mentioned as a version by Shi Nai'an of Qiantang. Gao Ru's *Baichuan Shuzhi* lists a hundred-chapter *Zhongyi Shuihu Zhuan*, also saying it's a version by Shi Nai'an of Qiantang, compiled and arranged by Luo Guanzhong. Li Zhuowu's preface to *Zhongyi Shuihu Zhuan* states that *Water Margin* is a work of passion by the two gentlemen, Shi and Luo. Only Wang Qi's *Xu Wenxian Tongkao* includes *Water Margin* in the classics, attributed solely to Luo Guanzhong. The *Water Margin* editions seen today from the Ming dynasty sometimes don't mention an author, sometimes credit Shi Nai'an as the editor, and sometimes say it was compiled by Shi Nai'an and edited by Luo Guanzhong. It's clear that people in the Ming Dynasty were already confused about whether the book was written by Shi Nai'an, Luo Guanzhong, or a collaboration.</p>
<p>Zhou Liangong's *Yinshuwu Shuying* says, "Tradition holds that *Water Margin* was written by Luo Guanzhong of Yue, in the early Hongwu period, or by Shi Nai'an of the Yuan Dynasty... Recently, Jin Shengtan, after the seventieth chapter, determined that it was continued by Luo Guanzhong, vehemently criticizing Luo, and falsely created a preface by Shi before, thus the book became Shi's." It's evident that crediting Shi Nai'an as the author of *Water Margin* was confirmed by Jin Shengtan around the Ming-Qing transition, and he also determined that the latter part of the *Water Margin* was continued by Luo Guanzhong. The modern scholar Wu Mei, in *Guqu Chentan*, said that "*Yougui* was written by Shi Junmei, whose given name was Hui, also known as the Layman Nai'an, who wrote *Water Margin*." He asserts that Shi Nai'an was also a playwright, but his basis is unknown. When Hu Shih wrote *Textual Research on Water Margin*, he said that Shi Nai'an was probably a fictitious character like "Mr. Uyou" or "Lord Wangshigong," merely a hypothetical name. This truly confuses us!</p>
<p>About a year ago, I saw an article in a newspaper supplement by Hu Ruiting called "Textual Research on Shi Nai'an's Ancestry," which seemed to confirm that Shi Nai'an was a real person. He said, "While conducting official household registration surveys, traversing long distances, and registering households, in Baicou Town, Dongtai County, there was a Shi Family Bridge. I saw in their ancestral hall the fifteenth generation ancestor whose personal name was Nai'an, and I secretly suspected him. Inquiring of his descendants, I learned that he was indeed Shi Nai'an, the author of *Water Margin*. Further, I requested to view the genealogy and obtained a brief history of Nai'an, as well as fragmented epitaphs." The brief history of Nai'an and the epitaphs will not be recorded here. According to this, *Water Margin* was indeed written by Shi Nai'an, and Shi Nai'an was indeed a real person. Even now, there is a genealogy to verify and descendants to inquire from. If the "Saint" Hu, who claims to have a penchant for textual research and history, were to see this news, wouldn't it be a joyful event?</p>
<p>If Hu Ruiting's article doesn't lie, and there is indeed a Shi family genealogy in Dongtai that can be verified and is reliable, then the case of Shi Nai'an, which has been a mystery since the Ming and Qing dynasties, can be resolved. First, we know that Shi Nai'an's given name was Zian, that he was from Huai'an at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, and that he once served as an official in Qiantang but left due to dissatisfaction. He personally witnessed Zhang Shicheng's uprising. He died when Shicheng failed, at the age of seventy-five. His birth and death were approximately between 1290 and 1365 AD. Second, Shi Nai'an's works are not limited to *Water Margin*. There are also *Zhi Yu*, *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, *Sui Tang Zhizhuan*, and *San Sui Ping Yao Zhuan*. Luo Guanzhong was indeed a disciple of Shi Nai'an and assisted Nai'an with his writing.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Watching the Haijingbo Circus</h3>
<p>— Ye Yongzhen</p>
<p>1.  The Elephant's Handstand</p>
<p>Because I am a commoner in a chaotic world, I want to see a little more of the things in front of me. So I bought a six-mao ticket and went into the Haijingbo Circus to watch a circus performance.</p>
<p>The opening act was a display of skills by Indian giant elephants. Five elephants, their heads decorated with bright, metallic trinkets, clanging and tinkling, followed a trainer into the arena, first circling around it.</p>
<p>The elephants walked in perfect step. I'm not paying attention to others; as for me, I had never seen elephants perform tricks, so I watched very carefully, with a touch of curiosity.</p>
<p>After that circle was completed, the trainer cracked the whip in his hand on the ground, and the five elephants all stopped in their places.</p>
<p>The first trick was for each elephant to raise its front two feet, while the other two feet behind remained prostrate. They did this very skillfully, as if they were used to it.</p>
<p>Then, the people watching in the arena laughed.</p>
<p>Because of this laughter, I don't know if they understood the people's compliments or felt the trainer's cues, but these five elephants, standing upright, moved their front legs up and down like bowing, and turned another circle in place.</p>
<p>Naturally, the people laughed even more. This time, the people themselves received the elephants' compliments.</p>
<p>Thus, what followed was the elephant pyramid. One elephant was curling two flags of "Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth" with its trunk, while the other four stood on both sides. The elephants in the back rested their front legs on the backs of the elephants in front, and their trunks were all curled up high.</p>
<p>The people laughed even louder, and some were clapping. This time, it wasn't just us yellow-faced people who benefited from the elephants' compliments, but the country as well. Needless to say, this is a dignified thing!</p>
<p>However, I myself felt that I had only laughed once, and that was at the end, when these five elephants performed handstands.</p>
<p>Imagine such corpulent animals, resting their front legs on the ground and desperately lifting their hind legs into the air to please people; how much is that effort worth people's sympathy, and how much is that situation worth people's amusement!</p>
<p>So I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>The performances of these five Indian giant elephants ended there. The metallic trinkets on their heads continued to ring, and they listened to the trainer's instructions and happily walked back to the "menagerie" in perfect step.</p>
<p>So I couldn't help but feel something:</p>
<p>In the Himalayas, the Karakoram Mountains, the Hindu Kush, the Suleiman Mountains, the Ghats of India, there are vast forests where these elephants could live and be raised, leaning against craggy rocks above and overlooking streams below. Wouldn't it be better for these elephants to live there and enjoy their lives without having to do so many performances? Why must they follow people, listen to the whip in their hands, and do so many sets of difficult things, only to seek their own livelihood and expose their various shortcomings? What good does this ultimately do for them? Does it mean that their freedom can be exchanged for a few shiny metal trinkets on their heads and a burst of laughter from the audience?</p>
<p>I think no one would think that way, if the elephants were a little smarter.</p>
<p>However, it is said that although elephants are the most enormous animals, they are also the most docile animals, and it is also said that the reason elephants are captured by humans is that there is first an internal traitor who lures their own kind to jointly enjoy this fate of hardship - then, if I think like that, I feel a little uneasy for myself.</p>
<p>Isn't it said that our nation is also the most enormous, the most docile, and the most prone to produce internal traitors?</p>
<p>Then everything can be predicted, can't it, everyone?</p>

<h3>Two Brothers (50)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>It was especially his father that struck him with alarm. Was this soft, content, and foolishly beaming fat man, Jean's father? No, no, Jean was not like him at all.</p>
<p>His family! For the past two days, a foreign and sinister hand, the hand of a dead man, had been pulling up and destroying all the ties binding these four people together, one by one. Now it was all over, everything had been destroyed. He no longer had a mother, because he could no longer love her, he could no longer respect her with that tenderness and absolute reverence that sons must have in their hearts. He no longer had a brother, because this brother of his was the son of a stranger. All that was left to him was a father, only this fat man, and this fat man, he did not love at all.</p>
<p>Suddenly he said:</p>
<p>"Hey, Mom, have you found that portrait?"</p>
<p>She stared at him in surprise:</p>
<p>"What portrait?"</p>
<p>"The portrait of Maraîsa."</p>
<p>"No, I haven't looked for it, but I think I can find it."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" Roland asked.</p>
<p>Pierre said to him:</p>
<p>"A portrait of Maraîsa that used to be in the living room when we lived in Paris. I thought Jean would be happy to have it."</p>
<p>Roland exclaimed:</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right, I remember it perfectly; and I even saw that portrait at the end of last week. When your mother was sorting out papers, she took it out of the desk. It was Thursday or Friday. Do you remember, Eglantine? At the time, I was shaving, and you took the portrait out of a drawer and placed it with a pile of letters on a chair next to you, and you burned half of that pile of letters, didn't you? Just two or three days before Jean received his inheritance, you touched that portrait, isn't that strange? If I believed in feelings, I would say that was one of those premonitions!"</p>
<p>Madame Roland replied calmly:</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right, I know where that portrait is; I'll go and find it."</p>
<p>So she had lied! Just this morning, when her son asked her where that portrait had gone, she had lied in her answer: "I don't remember very well... maybe it's in my writing desk."</p>
<p>A few days before, she had seen, read, touched, and looked at this painting, and then she had hidden it in that secret drawer, with some letters, with her private letters.</p>
<p>Pierre looked at his lying mother. He looked at her with the fury of a son who had been deceived, robbed of sacred love, he looked at her with the jealousy of a man who had been blind for a long time and had finally discovered a shameful affair. If he had been the woman's husband, he would have grabbed her wrist, grabbed her shoulders or grabbed her hair, thrown her to the ground, beat her, kicked her, trampled on her! But now he couldn't say anything, couldn't do anything, couldn't express anything, couldn't expose anything. He was her son, he had no revenge to take, he had not been wronged.</p>

<h3>Financial Exchange Rates Continue to Shrink, Gold Prices Rise Again by $4.90; Although There is Much Short Covering, Locked-in Supply is Also Strong; The Situation is Stable with No Special Changes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw the official U.S. buying price for newly mined gold remain unchanged at $34.01, leading to a uniform decline in exchange rates. Although the British pound remained stable, the U.S. dollar continued to weaken. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange also fell by varying amounts, from 4 to 5.3%. The price of raw gold in London fell by 2 dimes and 1.5 cents. U.S. cotton fell by 8 pounds per unit, and U.S. wheat fell by 1.25. Stock price fluctuations were minimal. The wool market opened and immediately rose above the $700 mark, soon climbing to $7034 before slightly declining. Although the morning market opened steadily, a Reuters report claiming that U.S. Senator Pittman told a Reuters reporter that he planned to urge the government to mint silver coins caused the price to break through the $700 mark. Later, the domestic market continued to harden, and the gold market fell further. At noon, the price rose slightly due to short covering, but the afternoon market opened flat, with limited fluctuations. Subsequently, as banks' appetite shifted to accepting, large traders rushed to cover their positions, briefly pushing the price above the $700 mark before closing back below it. The market situation for the day was initially firm but then leveled off, with the situation remaining stable. Although there was much short covering, the general supply of locked-in positions was also strong, resulting in a lack of significant change. The price of refined silver was $1,065, with a swap spread of around $9. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was $701.30, an increase of $6.70 from the previous close. Goods opened at $1.50.

Subsequently, Shun Lee, Heng Hsing, Chi Fung, Wing Heng, Yue Foo, Cheung Tai, Tak Shing, and others jointly sold off. A Reuters report quoted U.S. Senator Pittman making pro-silver remarks to reporters, making it difficult to cover the April U.S. dollar at 9375/10000, breaking through the $700 mark and falling to $698.50. It was rumored that HSBC was quoting the British pound at par and the U.S. dollar down 125/10000. Heng Yu, Yuan Mao, Wing Tai, Tak Shing, Chao Feng Cheung, Dah Sing Wing, and others gradually pushed the price up to $701. Later, the Yokohama Specie Bank and others offered the March U.S. dollar at 75/10000, and Foo Yu, Gan Cheung, Cheung Heng Tai, Tung Yik, and others sold, further lowering the price to below $699. At this point, the situation was still stable. Subsequently, Wai Cheung repeatedly sold aggressively, and Tak Shing and Wing Fung also sold, causing the domestic market to harden. The April U.S. dollar at 125/10000 was difficult to sell, falling to $6.30. Afterwards, the pattern slightly leveled off, fluctuating and rising. Yuan Mao and Wing Yo took positions and stabilized, and Chao Feng Cheung, Wing Fung, Yee Tai, and Wing Yung jointly bought strongly, pushing the price up to $8.80. With Heng Hsing and Cheng Cheung selling off, Citibank offered the December U.S. dollar at 125/10000, and the Yokohama Specie Bank also offered half a dollar for February, lowering the price to $7.10. The noon closing price was $697.30. The price rose slightly after the close, and goods were auctioned at $7.80.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $697.70, with goods opening at $7.60. Tung Fung and Heng Ching took positions, and the price stabilized from $7.30. Shun Lee and Foo Yu both took positions, rising to $8.50. HSBC and Dah Tung sold the January U.S. dollar at 125/10000 to the Yokohama Specie Bank, and Heng Hsing sold goods, causing the price to retreat to $7.50. Later, the foreign exchange market was calm, and gold prices did not fluctuate, hovering around $8. Then, Wah Bi bought half a dollar for February, Mitsui &amp; Co. and Kam Kam took 125/10000 for April, and the Yokohama Specie Bank, Heng Yu, Chi Fung, Wing Yuan, Fung Wing, Yee Tai, and Wing Yung successively bought, pushing the price up to $700.08. Mitsui &amp; Co. offered the March U.S. dollar at 6875/10000, and the Yokohama Specie Bank later offered 75/10000 for the same month. Shun Lee and Tai Fung Wing sold off, lowering the price to $698.70. Dah Sing Wing made an offering, and the price rose again, but Sheng Tai and Heng Hsing sold, and the closing price was $699.50. After the close, Hung Hing, Tung Tai Cheung, Yee Tai, Wing Yung, and Shun Lee sold, briefly retreating to around $9, but Yuan Chun and goods were offered, and the price eventually rose to around $700. Goods were auctioned at $9.50. The highest price for the day was $702.60, and the lowest price was $696.30, a difference of $6.30. As a result, the price rose $4.90 compared to the previous close.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Appeasing Students Studying in Japan</h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>Recently, Gan Jielan, the military attache of the Chinese embassy in Japan, stated that "abuse by Japanese dormitories and lodging industries has aroused resentment among students studying in Japan." Subsequently, the Cultural Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is striving to improve treatment in order to appease students studying in Japan, expecting them to become important figures in China when they return home in the future. If they do not have good intentions beforehand, they will inevitably loudly oppose Japan once they return to China, which will have a significant impact on Sino-Japanese friendship.</p>
<p>Japan's policy of aggression can be described as meticulous. They take what others discard, and we cannot help but admire their unique vision, appreciating this group of future "important figures in China" and "preparing in advance."</p>
<p>"Using barbarians to control barbarians" has been China's traditional diplomatic policy. Therefore, when Eastern powers invade, they quickly import Western powers as a counterbalance. Originally, the intention was to use "Barbarian A" to control "Barbarian B," not to use "A among Barbarian A" to control "B among Barbarian A." However, this trick has been learned by the Eastern neighbor, who is even more skilled in using the strategy of "using Chinese to control Chinese."</p>
<p>Supporting Warlord A to overthrow Warlord B, and then supporting Warlord B to overthrow Warlord A, has been the essence of Japan's diplomacy towards China for the past twenty years. For the success of this diplomatic policy, they must find henchmen among the students studying in Japan. Therefore, they make every effort to promote and create various terms such as "pro-Japanese faction," "pro-American faction," and "pro-Russian faction" in the hope of using the old trick of subjugating Korea to divide the Chinese people. They also implement a kind of anesthetic education for general students studying in Japan. This has been effective, and the creation of "Manchukuo" is a perfect example.</p>
<p>Since Japan created the so-called "Manchukuo," it has been using many students studying in Japan and well-known scholars as its henchmen everywhere. The "Manchukuo" Ministry of Education and the Education Bureau have organizations such as the "Royal Way Lecture Society" and the "Disaster Area慰慰团" [sic, probably 宣慰團, comfort group], and the members are mostly these students and scholars. The Japanese know very well the psychology of the villagers who worship foreign students, so they use their mouths to spread smoke bombs to the public, lecturing on absurd words such as "The True Lord is reborn, the Royal Way is revived, Manchuria and Japan are friendly, and the people live in peace and prosperity." Every time the Japanese puppet army massacres righteous soldiers or loots a village, they always bring out this group of people to lecture for a while, so that the people do not oppose the actions of the friendly army (Japanese army), so as to save them to the paradise of the Royal Way. (See the Education in the Northeast after the Incident in the 48th issue of the 8th volume of the Life Weekly) How can 30 million people be ruled by 10 to 20 thousand Japanese troops? It all depends on these henchmen. The education that the Japanese have given to Chinese students studying in Japan has not been in vain, but our study abroad has been entirely run by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Originally, the reason for studying abroad was admiration and learning for one's own reference, but the result was that some people were "left behind by the 'learning'," which is truly a strange thing. What I don't understand is that people are generally called animals with emotions and reason, but why are Chinese people so docile and able to receive Japanese education to "meet expectations"? I am afraid that it is not a "bitter life" destined, but a "slave life" destined?</p>
<h3>Restoration</h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>The twentieth century does not count as ours, because China in 1933, on the surface, seems to be working hard to "run forward" with others, and even shouting "catch up"; in reality, it is desperately "driving backward," "turning around," and everything presents a "restoration" scene!</p>
<p>First, after the May Fourth Movement, the "New Culture Movement has not yet succeeded," and the thread-bound "classics" that were just "shelved" have been encouraged to be read again. It is said that the classics are China's only "treasure book" (half a book of Confucius can govern the world), and all of China's current academic fields have been differentiated from it: "When drinking water, think of the source," how can we "discard it like a worn shoe"? Therefore, "people with intentions" have "worked hard" and "vigorously promoted it." From then on, "the spirit remains in the Lu Temple," and "our way will not decline"!</p>
<p>Secondly, the "imperial examination system," which was recognized as harmful to scholars and overthrown, has now been "revived" with the shells of "general examinations" and "higher examinations." The only difference is that what was tested before was the "national eight-legged essay," and what is tested today is the "foreign eight-legged essay." As for the "new top scholars" who are "named on the gold list" after the "palace examination," although they are not fortunate enough to receive the favor of the "Empress Dowager" personally pinning flowers; it is considered extremely honorable that "important figures" attend the ceremony to award certificates in person - moreover, although the streets have not been paraded as usual, it is certain that they will not use "horse riding" or "carriage riding," but will change to "motorcycle." In addition, the "unified examination" for primary and secondary schools, which was "vigorously and swiftly" implemented for a while, has also "emerged in response to the times." It can be seen that the "new imperial examination system" is even more prosperous today than in the past!</p>
<p>Thirdly, novels of the "gods and monsters" and "martial arts" genres have been strictly prohibited in "repeated orders"; even the films made by "Burning Big Hero" and others "to practice the mission of social education" have also suffered; but the countless "martial arts heroes" who have been abandoned, who have fought the "Eighteen Bronze Men Array," and who have been hidden in deep mountain temples for a long time, and the "jianghu heroes" who possess the unique skills of "flying over eaves and walking on walls," are fortunate enough to be able to raise their eyebrows and show their skills thanks to the "national examination"; and the "national martial arts," which has been passed down for thousands of years, has been able to avoid being buried. It is precisely "Heaven has not abandoned this martial art!" "We" take scholars through examinations" and "swing the stage to select heroes" at the same time; both literary and military skills are valued, which can be called a good plan. Unfortunately, no one has been able to pass the higher examination and be selected in the national examination at the same time; otherwise, the "literary and martial arts top scholar" who has both literary and martial arts stars descending on one person will be seen again in today's world!</p>
<p>The above are the major events, and there are still many to be listed! However, today's "restoration" in China only restores "half" of it, not "all" of it. For example, although ancient books must be studied in schools, natural sciences and social sciences must also be read; national martial arts should be enthusiastically promoted, and gunpowder, cannons, and airplanes must still be prepared.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are also opposite examples, which are very "trendy." That is the unspeakable, typical "as instructed" official document, which is said will be changed to colloquial language in the future, and even the addition of new-style punctuation and symbols is being implemented. This miracle is considered "rare and valuable" in our "ancient" and huge country. Who knows that there is a gentleman who is not content and sighs as if saying: "The promotion of colloquial language has been more than ten years old now, and as a result, only a few punctuation marks and symbols have been occupied in six-character notices and official documents, and there is a large group of people who are furious and indignant. I really don't know when the complete elimination of the feudal system will be."</p>
<p>Restoration is not necessarily a bad phenomenon. "Things will turn when they reach their extreme." Chinese culture may have now progressed to the highest degree, and restoration is a "necessary trend." Because "restoration" is "reversal." I remember the British old man Bernard Shaw ridiculed us, saying, "China has no culture"; this is simply a lie!</p>
<h3>Relying on Connections</h3>
<p>— Xu Cun</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou, the clerk, put on a stern face and said to him, "You really don't understand things. Last time you came, you brought a letter from Secretary Zhu. If there was something to do, wouldn't I have kept you? Would I have asked you to leave?"</p>
<p>He stood there respectfully. For every sentence Mr. Zhou said, he responded with "yes." He waited until he had finished speaking, and then bowed and said with a smile to the clerk Zhou, "What you said is absolutely right! But I am really too miserable. I can't stand not having anything to do for so long. So when I went back last time, I went to find Mrs. Wu, the director of the bank. Because she is from my hometown, and Mr. Wu has a wide circle of friends. I wanted to ask her to find something else for me to do. When I went, Mrs. Wu happened to be at home. I told her what I meant. She said that Secretary Zhu's letters are not very reliable. Because he writes too many letters of recommendation. Even if there are good positions, he has his own close people to arrange for. She said that there must still be vacancies here. But according to the rules, some have to be reserved for the people in high positions. Since you are in a hurry to find something to do, and you can't find anything else for the time being, I have to write a letter myself. You take this letter and go ask Mr. Zhou. Ask him not to make things difficult for you, and just say that I said so. I will say hello to Mr. Wu when he comes. This is her letter. I still ask you to give me a little work to do for Mrs. Wu's sake. As long as I can get by, I will no longer bother you repeatedly!" As he said this, he took out a letter from his body and presented it to Mr. Zhou with both hands.</p>
<p>He stood there bowing respectfully, watching Mr. Zhou's expression.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou took the letter and read it. After reading it, he paused slightly, frowned, and said to him gently, "There really is no work anymore. Who doesn't have relatives and friends they know? You think! But since there is a letter from the director's wife, you can stay temporarily and do some odd jobs here for me. I will find a way for you to fill a formal position in the future."</p>
<p>Hearing this, he was as happy as a criminal hearing a pardon. From then on, he helped the original servant in the general affairs office, doing sweeping, fetching water, pouring tea, turning on the lights, and all kinds of chores. He did everything carefully. Mr. Shen, who worked with Mr. Zhou, also often praised him.</p>
<p>One evening, Mr. Zhou asked him to call Ah Fu, who was in charge of the reception room. Mr. Zhou said to Ah Fu with anger on his face, "I know you don't care whether you do it or not. Look at the reception room you are in charge of. I don't know how many days the floor hasn't been swept. The lights are on all night. You don't care about appearances, and you don't care about wasting resources. Do you want to go back to your hometown? Pack your bags as soon as possible and leave here tonight. Once..." Ah Fu was baffled when he heard this. He was stunned for a long time. Should he argue? It's not good to offend his superior! If he doesn't argue, he has a belly full of grievances that he can't tell! He had no choice but to suppress his anger and slowly replied, "I sweep the floor every day. You can investigate if you don't believe me. If I really don't sweep, you can punish me! As for the lights, Mr. Shen said that the other rooms are lit, and that room is dark, which is not very good. So he told me to turn them on. You can ask him if you don't believe me."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know you are very good at explaining. But now it's useless to be able to explain. Don't be long-winded. Hurry up and pack your bags and come back to settle your wages."</p>
<p>Ah Fu had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>After a while, Mr. Shen walked in hurriedly. He asked Mr. Zhou, "I heard that you are going to fire Ah Fu? Ah Fu almost cried when he saw me and asked me to intercede for him. It was indeed me who told him to turn on the lights. I don't think there is anything else wrong. Why don't you forgive him for the first time? What do you think?"</p>
<p>"Old Li, you don't know. These people rely on their seniority and their big connections. If I don't give them some fear, it will be difficult to do things in the future. — Saying this, he lowered his voice again. — Moreover, the one who was recommended by the director's wife is also idle and has nothing to do."</p>
<p>Mr. Shen nodded silently.</p>
<p>From then on, he was in charge of the reception room, doing the things that Ah Fu used to do.</p>
<h3>A Mother's Lesson</h3>
<p>— Hu Ziju</p>
<p>"Lin'er, why did you sneak out to the road alone again today?" Lin'er's mother, a middle-aged woman of eleven years - holding the little hand of Lin'er, a child of seven or eight years old who had just strolled back from outside the alley gate - asked.</p>
<p>"Because it's very lively there, and there's a monkey show," Wang Yi, a calligrapher and painter of modern celebrities, originally from Changzhou</p>
<p>Lin'er replied, "So I went out to see it. Mom, that monkey is really smart! It can dress itself and wear a hat!" Lin'er, whose childishness had not faded, still deeply remembered the fun of the monkey he had just seen outside the alley gate. He simply did not hear his mother's question.</p>
<p>"Haven't I been telling you every day that children shouldn't run to the road alone without their parents' permission?" Lin'er's mother asked, chasing after the question because her question had not yet been understood by Lin'er.</p>
<p>"Mom, are you saying: there is a foreigner with a full face of beard and a yellow cloth wrapped on his head standing on the road over there?" Lin'er asked his mother with some understanding.</p>
<p>"Yes, he likes to catch children the most!" Mom said.</p>
<p>"I also know that," Lin'er said, "He wants to catch us Chinese children and make medicine!"</p>
<p>"I have other things I told you! Do you remember?"</p>
<p>"I remember them all in my heart." Lin'er nodded and said, "Those white-faced, blue-eyed foreigners running around on the road, they all want to catch our Chinese children too. Mom, is that right?"</p>
<p>"Then why did you sneak out to the road alone again today?"</p>
<p>"I have never been to the road!" Lin'er replied eagerly, "I just watched a monkey show at the alley gate. Later, I unintentionally saw a white-faced, blue-eyed foreigner not far from our alley gate, hitting a rickshaw puller with a stick. The rickshaw puller kept kowtowing to him. I was also afraid of being caught by that foreigner, so I ran back home in a hurry."</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? Those foreigners will hit adults with sticks when they see them, and they will catch those children to make medicine. Lin'er, think about it, how terrible is that?"</p>
<p>"It's extremely terrible!" Lin'er was stunned.</p>
<p>"Then will you dare to run out to the alley gate alone to play next time?" Lin'er's mother, knowing that her lecture this time had achieved considerable results, was very happy in her heart, and asked Lin'er further.</p>
<p>"Mom, I will definitely not dare to run out to the alley gate alone to wander around next time." Lin'er's small mouth finally uttered these words. Then a smile of victory could not help but appear on Lin'er's mother's cheeks.</p>
<h3>"Processing and Rushing to Build" People</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The "God of Peace" has long been suffering from an incurable disease in Geneva and is approaching its death, but war is overlooking the two sides of Europe and the Pacific, making a hideous and satisfied smile! So, the whole world in turmoil is "busy"; the giants of various countries are "busy" with how to make their regimes more centralized and violent; diplomats are "busy" with intrigue, scheming, and colluding with each other; the "valve" characters of the army, navy, and air force are "busy" with expanding their budgets and rushing to build warships, airplanes, and tanks; Buddhist laymen and "children of God" are "busy" with "praying for peace" as in the old example of the European war. In this tense atmosphere where everyone is "busy," only the old black shirt leader Mussolini and the new brown shirt leader Hitler are, in addition to being "busy" with everything that imperialists should be "busy" with, even more "busy" with encouraging the "Chichi Yuanyuan" [common people] of their respective countries to process and rush to build the second generation of little citizens or little fascists. "Bearing, gathering, teaching, and training," "seeing the micro and knowing the far," we really cannot but admire the abilities of these two black and brown "star lords," who are indeed different from ordinary people.</p>
<p>On the "Wedding Festival" of October 30, Mussolini presented gifts to 2,000 married couples, and also gave a set of new clothes to the babies who participated in the baptism ceremony on that day: The Prime Minister also gave a birthday speech, saying that 1934 will become a "four-year" for single men, that is, the government will levy taxes on those who do not marry.</p>
<p>Hitler has examined the physique of 1.5 million young men and women in Germany in the past three months, and like Mussolini, he encourages marriage. According to the application of the married, the government can lend each married couple 600 marks. According to Reuters on November 22, there are already 10,000 people in Berlin who have applied for loans at the registration office.</p>
<p>The significance of this "new strategy" of rewarding sexual intercourse and spreading seeds is very obvious. First, it shows that the imperialists are determined to go to war. In order to prepare for the terrible sacrifices of killing everywhere and rivers of blood, the strong men who are prepared to go to the front line to "fight for the motherland" must have the need to spread seeds and rush to build "reserve cannon fodder." Second, it shows the terrible destructive power of modern war on mankind and all civilized achievements. The European war, which lasted for four years of indiscriminate killing and chopping, resulted in "only" the creation of several tombs that together accommodated more than 2 million soldiers as "unknown heroes." However, now, after more than ten years of "continuous improvement" in killing technology, the infinite development of air force power, and the greater application of chemistry to war, the destructive power of war has increased several times compared to the European war, making major cities such as London, New York, and Tokyo in danger of being turned into ruins at any time under the attack of the enemy's air force. Under this terrible war race of "digging their own graves," how can imperialists, who are certainly no less clever than you and me, not worry about the "extinction" or "reduced production" of "cannon fodder" and "reserve army of industry" in the future - so Mussolini and Hitler's reward for "manufacturing little citizens" is really based on the actual needs of war mania, not only for the sake of "improving the race" or "multiplying the population," nor just for solving the "sexual desire problem" for his disciples and grandchildren,</p>
<p>Why did the wooden clogs "friends" who rushed to the forefront of the war give up this fashionable game of "rewarding people"? The reason is very simple: First, the population growth rate in Japan was originally higher than in Italy and Germany, so there is no need for "processing and rushing to build"; second, after cutting off Manchuria, they have gained more than 10 million "cannon fodder" (excluding "women"), which they do not need to manufacture themselves. Why not "generously" use the "heads" of others in the war?</p>
<p>Imperialism is "processing and manufacturing people" for the sake of mass slaughter, while our country is advocating "national martial arts" in order to "resist." Comparing the two, I see that the heads of many compatriots have been "reserved" to dance wildly in the burning Pacific fire! Alas! What else can I say!</p>
<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Shanghai (12)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>I briefly described the changes this time, and I have decided to leave my family. Based on the lessons we have learned, we will restore our Zhengyi Society. Although our younger brother is a fifteen-year-old child, he has firm self-confidence. If he cannot help our society, he will not destroy it. "Gao Fei, do you allow my younger brother to join?" I stared at Gao Fei, while seeking the opinions of the entire table.</p>
<p>"I agree, two love experts!" Little Huang was the first to jump up again.</p>
<p>Twenty, you don't have a wife yet.</p>
<p>When we came out of the restaurant, it was already nine o'clock. Gao Fei said, why don't you stay at the society tonight? Little Huang, Chongqing, and Xiaofeng are all at the society, so Little Huang won't shout for three missing one.</p>
<p>A group of people laughed and talked. The spring breeze on Avenue Joffre, intoxicating, blew on our faces. My heart fluttered, as if I was thrown into the arms of a lover. Thinking carefully about what had happened in the past two days, the crisp footsteps echoed as we stepped on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>At the Rue Luber intersection, everyone parted ways. The four of us walked south. Perhaps joy occupied everyone's hearts, and we all walked slowly, with our long, thin shadows dappling. Only Little Huang was jumping and walking, and the shadow of the person on the ground was like a short winter melon. Xiaofeng joked with him:</p>
<p>"Little Huang, mahjong tonight?"</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay!" He forgot he was running. "It's really hard to find a partner. Once they have a wife, they all want to go home to sleep."</p>
<p>"You don't have a wife yet?" I asked.</p>
<p>Little Huang glanced at me and shook his head, seeming to feel sad. Little Huang is a famous optimist in our society, but talking about wives makes him sad. He said himself, love is not known to be the real thing, I have not met a woman who loves me! From then on, I made fun of him as a topic, and he returned the nickname "love expert."</p>
<p>When we arrived at the society on Route Lafayette, Little Huang lay down on the bed. Chongqing and Xiaofeng deliberately turned the mahjong tiles over on the table and played with them. Little Huang pouted and covered his head with a quilt, and we laughed together.</p>
<p>Two hours later, they were all fast asleep. The surroundings were as quiet as death, with the occasional horn sound of a speeding car. I looked at the ceiling, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep. Helplessly, I sat up and wrote a letter to Sister Min, telling her about today's events: how my uncle prevaricated me, my cousin's situation, my younger brother's letter, and finally meeting old friends from the past. I wrote in a jumbled manner, filling three sheets of letter paper. I lit a cigarette and read it again, but it seemed unsatisfactory. Why tell her so much? Suddenly, Little Huang laughed. I thought he had seen my situation, but he turned over and fell asleep again. He probably had a dream about a woman? I couldn't help but smile at the letter paper myself, struck a match, and folded the three sheets of letter paper and burned them. I picked up the pen again and wrote simply.</p>

<h3>Flower Fallen into the Privy</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>When I was four years old, due to the pressure of money, my parents sold me to someone for more than a hundred yuan. At first, I inevitably cried and made a fuss, but after two or three months, I gradually got used to it. Who knew that when I turned fourteen, my foster mother forced me into prostitution. Although I knew this was a vile thing, I finally succumbed to this wretched path to avoid the pain of being beaten and scolded. Alas! Can my fate still be imagined? Who knew that this year, my foster mother, having obtained more than a thousand yuan, married me off to a forty-something civil servant who already has a wife. Sir—please think about it! Would an eighteen-year-old girl willingly marry him? But, unable to withstand the coercion, I reluctantly stamped the marriage certificate during a simple wedding ceremony. In the latter half of my time as a prostitute, I met a young student, whose character, temperament, and learning were all excellent, not to mention his feelings. He once tried to commit suicide because his family prevented him from marrying me. Now he has obtained a decent job, is no longer bound by his family's finances, and can officially marry me. But what about me? I am already a married woman. If I don't divorce my current husband, my lover and I will never become a couple. But what are the divorce procedures? Should I file a lawsuit? What are the grounds? Can I actually get divorced? This matter truly puts me in a dilemma. Sir, you are the compass of society. Please answer these questions. Respectfully wishing you good health.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Sun Meixian</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>Editor's Note: If Ms. Sun files a lawsuit with the court to sever her relationship with her current husband, the other party will definitely not strongly resist. Firstly, because he is a married man, to avoid the crime of bigamy, your relationship is merely that of a husband and concubine. The binding force of this type of relationship is far less close than that of a married couple in the eyes of the law; it can be kept if agreeable, or abandoned if not. Secondly, because he is a civil servant, openly taking a concubine will undoubtedly affect his future. Thirdly, although you stamped the marriage certificate, judging from the common psychology that an eighteen-year-old girl would never willingly marry a man over forty, no one would doubt that this matter was coerced.</p>
<p>However, your husband may suspect that you and your foster mother are engaged in fraudulent behavior and file a counterclaim. But your foster mother will be responsible for this. Even if you received a small share of the more than a thousand yuan she took, the amount would not be much; the majority would naturally be enjoyed by your foster mother. She spent more than a hundred yuan to buy you, endured ten years of simple meals, used you as a cash cow for four years, and finally acted without conscience, ruining your life. It would be good for her to receive some retribution, as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Market News</h3>
<h3>Aviation Little Series is About to be Published</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, the public has gradually realized the importance of aviation. The government is doing its best to promote it, and the people are donating funds to purchase aircraft. Even young children are saving their candy money for this purpose. It is now reported that the Aviation Administration has specially compiled and published a variety of Aviation Little Series for children's education, with one issue every week. The content is divided into stories, flight, air defense, travelogues, warfare, anecdotes, maxims, anecdotes, speeches, etc., with colorful covers and photographic illustrations. The text is simple and fluent, and the printing is exquisite and beautiful, making it very suitable for children to read. The cost is kept low, and special discounts are offered for long-term subscriptions. All parents who love their children should subscribe for a long term, it is said.</p>
<h3>Aviation Yearbook Will Soon be Completed</h3>
<p>It has been more than twenty years since aviation was established in our country. Due to political changes in the past, there has been little progress. Since the national government established its capital in Nanjing and the political system was unified, the aviation industry has also flourished. Although it is not enough to compare with other countries, fortunately it has taken on a basic form. If the public's assistance is effective, the future will be bright. Since Mr. Xu Peigen has been the head of the Aviation Administration, he has made many achievements in promoting aviation, and he is particularly enthusiastic about popularizing aviation education. In addition to the Aviation Magazine and Aviation Bulletin issued by the Administration, which have already become popular for a while, the China Aviation Yearbook is also being compiled, totaling several chapters and 300,000 words. It is reported that the manuscript can be completed and printed within the year.</p>
