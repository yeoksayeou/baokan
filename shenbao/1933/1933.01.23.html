<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c43">今日之兩大問題穗 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>今日横梗於吾人之眼前者有兩大問題。一爲「抗日」一爲「安定大衆之生活」。安定大衆之生活爲「安内」而抗日即爲「攘外」。</p>
<p>奚以言今日之談救國者。固莫不曰救國當自「安内」着手矣。然而内何由安臨之以威力不可也施之以小惠不可也其唯一之　。厥爲塞亂源。亂何自曰。飢餓曰冷凍。荀子不云乎。衣食足而後知榮辱。」民食無食衣無衣。老弱轉徙少壯流離。且或野盈餓莩。生之所迫。則民烏得不亂。世無好亂之民。但有走險之衆生之所迫則一夫夜呼。應者四起。徵之史蹟。斑斑可考。民已不知死所矣。若又以威臨之。以死懼之。是何異揚湯止沸。亂源未塞。則亂何由而平。故今日吾人而言安内。其唯一之道。即在於「安定人民之生活。」使民皆有食有衣。樂歲飽煖兇歲亦不至流離。民知有生之樂。自不願行險以决意。苟其不然。官皆養尊處優。民則旣寒且餒。益以天災人禍。益以苟捐離稅。人民呼訴無　。如去冬河南有災民四千。逃死至津津。不納。遣之南下。南方亦急電拒絶。道載流亡。官吏熟視若無覩。且互相推諉。則民何貴乎有國家。故今日而言安定人民之生活當然爲政府應負之責任。而無可諉卸無可稍自遷延者。</p>
<p>奚以言「抗日。」自九一八以來。日本即無日不欲扼　喉。一舉而制我死命。　之大陸政策已思之熟籌之審。一載以來。日對我有加無已之暴行。絶非偶然即列强之沉默觀變。莫肯作　義之發言。亦自各有其政治與經濟之背景更非無因。吾人不抵抗之政策。旣不能遏止侵略者前進之步向世界呼籲申訴。亦不能博得公道之援助。則吾人今日除以自力謀自衛自救而外。更復何所期待。何所希冀。自衛自救之道爲何。曰抵抗。曰鬥爭。以最大之决心。作死力之奮鬭。終可得最後之勝利。否則伈伈俔俔遷延荀安。不戰不和。任人宰削。事實上直如待死耳。</p>
<p>今日民苦深矣然而吾人敢斷言。其苦而爲衛護我民族之生存。爲反抗强暴者之侵略。則無論苦至若何之地步。我民當無怨言。蓋此爲我大衆求最後之出路。非苦决無由得。倘若其苦非爲抗暴。而徒銷耗救國之精神財力於冥冥無形之中。則外患與内憂交相煎逼。我國前途大難。誠不知伊於胡極。</p>
<p>故就今日之情勢言。「抗日」與「安定人民之生活」。固都爲當前最迫切最嚴重之問題。但權衡緩急輕重。則吾人認「抗日」尤急於「安定人民之生活。」</p>

<p>巴本内閣是大總統内閣、在他的閣員中沒有一個議員、同時又是變象的法西斯内閣、然而巴本自身并不是希托拉的國家社會黨員、他和希托拉黨的關係何如呢、原來巴本組閣的時候、就是僅負空名、而實際上的内閣總理是希托拉、所以巴本總理雖以陰謀辛辣著稱於世其實也是一個傀儡總理、然則巴本政府與希托拉黨的關係何如呢、從大體上看、巴本内閣是在希托拉指導之下、就勢力關係上言、巴本内閣的國防總長施萊赫　將軍握有國防軍的實權、可以指揮政治上的一切、就這一點政治關係的社會基礎而論、國社黨是普魯士的大地主、重工業資本家、和軍部勢力結合而成的、</p>
<p>德國的法西斯蒂（國家社會黨）、與意大利法西斯蒂、各有不同、意大利法西斯蒂政權是由下而上的、從羅馬進軍之後、他就得到了政權、德國却不然、希托拉所領導的國家社會黨、并不曾向柏林進軍（縱然天天在街市上有小衝突、但是這種衝突不過是打架式的械鬭而已、并不算政治上的流血武劇）、而國社黨的組織又是由上而下、（德國新興資本家勢力不甚雄厚、加以無產勞工的組織從社會民主黨到共產黨都很有力量）、所以國社黨是以大地主·金融資本·重工業資本家·與軍人等爲核心、而以帶白領頭的中層份子爲羣衆、在本年七月三十日選舉之前、國社黨可算　盛極一時、德國的將來幾乎完全在希托拉手裏、可是選舉之後、他并不曾得到半數以上的多數議席、他沒有支配德意志聯邦政局的可能、於是希托拉黨如午後的太陽、今後惟有續漸西斜、縱然還有他的若干生命、可是再不能有更大的發展了、這是因爲社會勢力的關係、即使再解散幾次國會、再重行幾回選舉、也不會有什麽特殊的變化、於是十一月六日的大選結果、希托拉雖然仍舊領導第一黨、可是失去了三十五個議席、巴本·施萊赫爾派失敗之後、政治權力就更不安定、十二月三日之後、德意志聯邦内閣總理的榮冠、乃歸諸施萊赫爾將軍、不用講、這更是完全的大總統内閣、而且是純粹的軍人内閣、</p>
<p>施萊赫爾總理就職之初、即以大總統命令、撤消巴本前内閣所公布之「共和國保護法」中的三項條例、計㈠撤廢政治犯特别裁判之規定、㈡撤廢强制登載政府公式聲明之法令、㈢共和政體之保護雖仍存在、而削除前德皇威廉第二歸返德國之禁條、前德皇是否就此歸國而無所顧忌、還是個問題、不過這在歐洲却是很値得人注意的一個重大問題、第一、現政府何以特别下令解除凱薩歸國的禁令、第二、現在的德國紛亂疲弱、快要到山窮水盡的地步、是否要用復辟來打動人心呢、對於第一個問題的分析、當然是十分微妙、而且不免有多少皮相的觀察、咸以爲現總統興登堡是元帥、施萊赫爾又是一位將軍、德國政治的移動都帶着軍刀的聲音、這是軍國主義的抬頭、所以會推論、</p>
<p>到帝政的復辟、其實事情不是這樣簡單、現在德國的軍人、并不是東普魯士出身的興登堡元帥所可得而完全代表、南德國的將校、比較上有自由思想、例如前國防總長古洛愛納將軍、就是主張德皇退位的發起人、現總理施萊赫爾將軍、也是貧農出身、他們并不一定有復辟的陰謀、第二個問題無異爲第一個問題之演繹、但以國家社會黨而論、也和代表易白河以東的地主貴族殘骸的國權黨大不相同、他們要變小德意志主義爲大德意志主義、他們具有神聖帝國時代的精神、所以雖示前德皇以若干好感、却并不主張復辟、何况　方面還有共產黨在中間、一方面凱薩已經表示不願歸國、所以施萊赫爾内閣撤廢凱薩歸國禁令的主因、不過是用爲緩和國社黨·國權黨·右翼黨派等的反感的一種策略而已、（一九三二年十二月十八日於柏林）</p>

<p>調解失敗勝於延宕並勸國人速圖自救</p>
<p>新聲社云、中委伍朝樞、昨對記者發表談話·表示最近英國之袒日態度、爲其心理上與利害關係之必然趨勢、并勸國人覺悟、抛棄其素昔依賴國聯之觀念、迅圖自救、茲分誌其談話於後、</p>
<h3 id="c121">英國袒日 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>伍氏於開始談話前、先莞爾語記者曰、君欲擬叩詢者、無異出題向余實行考試也、繼乃答記者問、謂英國最近在國聯會議中、袒日態度、謂其爲應付對美戰債問題、此亦係一理由、然渠以爲英之袒日、實有天然之趨勢、㈠就吾人所知者、英日聯盟關係、雖已取消、然英國在通常非戰爭時期、能與某一國家締盟、此誠爲破天荒之事、當二十年前、英國願與日本締盟、此固由於對付俄國、然另一原因、亦實因當時英國朝野、與日本有相當之感情結合、此種感情作用、至今尙未全完消滅、英國保守黨具此種心理與受其影響爲尤巨、故今日英國當道袒白、此其主因也、大多數人、以爲英日同盟、旣已解約、於是英日密切關係、亦隨之斷絶、實則不然、取消同盟、僅係一種外交政策而已、㈡英國與東三省之關係、並不重大、比較有關係者、爲中國其他各地、英國目下、且無此力量、以制止暴日、遂不得不聽憑其於與本身關係較小之地點、實行侵略、而英國之損失爲輕、於此種種、皆心理上與利害關係上之重大者耳、</p>
<h3 id="c122">速謀自救 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>伍氏繼言、就國聯對中日問題之最近調解情形而論、如果然失敗、依照盟約第十五條第四節繕具報告、則此次報告、是否於我國有利、吾人難於揣測、國聯果能出此、如何可置不論、總可勝過現下延宕情形、且可促醒國人素昔依賴國聯者之迷夢、惟有自圖拯救而已、</p>
<h3 id="c123">國聯如此 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>談至此、伍氏復憶述其一年前　國聯之批評云、國聯固係一種國際之良好組織、然一切皆仰給於各國、今日欲以此無財無力之組織、以謀解决中日重大爭端、其可得乎、國聯一孩童而已、五十年後、則尙可勝於今日也、然此孩童成人後、究屬棟樑之材、或爲茅荻、則難預測、目下不過係一宣傳及申述公理之所在而已、</p>

<p>交部整理發展情形</p>
<p>交通部長兼敎育部長朱家驊、自日前抵滬後、新聲社記者、特於昨日訪之於滄州飯店、當叩以交通部及敎育部之一切問題、承詳談各點如下、</p>
<h3 id="c127">整理郵局 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>據朱氏云、郵政匯業局之合併、業已决定、郵政局之整頓、仍本以前所發表之計劃進行、至於整頓原因、一方因東北問題、及匪區軍事行動關係、郵政經濟、蒙受極大打擊、故爲維持國内郵政起見、决即從事緊縮、凡以前坐領乾薪而不事工作者、一律裁撤、以資節省、此外如雲南新疆等僻處邊陲之區、因交通不便、輾轉輸運、諸多困難、同時邊省幣制、備受跌落、但郵局仍須照常服務、不得不忍痛犧牲、以維持邊省交通、凡此各點、皆須整頓改革、俾使發展、</p>

<p>招商局收回國營後、理事會及總經理等、業已積極進行、先去積弊、裁員緊縮、亦係節省經濟、多　實益之要圖、現整頓計劃、尙在劉總經理詳細擬具中、整頓的欵、將來或發公債、或由財部指撥、惟尙未完全决定、收回股票、迄至最近止、猶有半數、惟至二月底即行截至矣、至陳孚木李國杰等之舞弊案、旣交法院公開審理、已爲法律部分、交通部不再顧問、惟與中國營業公司之合同、則必取消也、</p>

<p>又謂、國際無綫電台籌劃之中英通電、現經交通部迭與馬可尼公司商洽之結果、所有材料機件、概由中英庚欵會中撥借預料裝置完全、總當在半載以後、此項通報實行、中英關係、必可更進一步、</p>

<p>至於馬凱合同、因於中國方面、受損過巨、故經發覺後、即嚴重交涉、竭力設法取消、但迭經交部與該公司交涉後、因已正式訂立、進行較爲困難、但交部必爲我國主權計、仍繼續交涉、以達實行取消之目的</p>

<p>繼稱財部此次所擬召集各部院共商財政統一辦法一事、原則上業已完全决定、惟進行辦法、手續較繁、短時期間尙難實現、至敎育部長一職、自經簡派翁文灝氏接任後、初甚堅辭、繼經中央慰留後、已允擔任、惟現因華北緊張、在平維持學校事務、尙未能南來就職、在此期内、祗得暫由本人兼代云、</p>

<p>丨午謙行君來信丨</p>
<p>我是江西金谿人。今年十月間，家鄒被紅軍佔領，我無法可想，只好逃出虎口，來外求生計。本擬到湖南津市表兄處，謀一位置，不料來津市以後，遍尋無著，川資又已告盡，異地之人，舉目無親，又只得將所有物件典當，做一個提籃小販。豈知不滿三日，又被無聊痞子，在晚上將我幾個銅元，一雙小籃，如數偷空，弄得我上天無路，入地無門！命途多乖，那有甚於我者？現在我爲暫時計，想帮人爲傭，又苦無人介紹；想做苦工，又因手無縛鷄之力，更加自力不佳；想沿門乞食，又恐遭人白眼，年青的人，那肯出此下策？因特函請先生速賜指示迷途，不勝感激之至！</p>
<p>覆：讀罷來信，不禁長歎！說起來你個人的問題很簡單，只要大家凑幾十塊錢，給你做個小本生意；或是代你推薦一個職業，便可了事。但是你的生活只是現在中國社會衰敗的生活中之一點一滴的反映；解决了你個人問題。却解决不了產生你這種生活的社會問題，所謂「安得廣厦千萬間，大庇天下寒士盡歡顏？」不但做不至，即使做到，也不過是「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚」的辦法。而且報館的職責，縮小範圍，即「讀者顧問」的記者的職責只在於：（一）指出讀者對於個人生活問題的疑難所在：（二）供給社會問題之理論上的意見：（三）從最大多數的民衆立塲，把讀者個人生活問題的解决與整個社會生活問題的解决聯繫起來，不要只看見樹而不看見森林。不過你還有一條生活，就是「做苦工」，觀君來信、只說是「手無縛鷄之力，」「更加目力不佳，」並沒說沒有苦工可做。所謂苦工，也有個等差，有的苦工，自然不是體力過弱的人所能勝任，有的却並不需多大的膂力。若果你有苦工可做，那就做苦工罷。因爲你已到山窮水盡，不做苦工，只有死；不錯，另外還有一條路：做賊盜：然而做賊盜輕則坐牢，重則槍斃，結果也是死。兩害相權取其輕，做苦工總還可以保着一條活命。年紀輕輕的，社會的前途雖說黑暗，然已露出光明，大家努力奮鬭向前，會有一日完全變成苦工的社會，那苦工便是樂工了。</p>

<p>我對於汪君本月二十一日在本欄發表的來函，有兩點的答復。第一，我說汪君措辭頗不明，是因爲編者和我說起，那一段文字不易了角。我讀了之後，覺得汪君原文，的確寫的很有點草率，有幾個字不容易認清楚。同時，内中的措辭，如「輸出入的統計給實現的，即生產資本與商品資本之積集一個標準」。等句子，的確也有些不易了解。在報紙上發表的文字，我很主張把字句練得淺顯，使一般的讀者都能懂得，所以我主張請汪君整理一下。第二，經濟學上的工具，早已經夠用了。我們後學的責任，就是選擇適宜的理論的工具，應用在當前的事實。我决計沒有像徐青甫老先生那樣大胆，在經濟學上做革命和發明的工作。眼前所可痛恨的，就是資產階級的經濟學者，就是目下的正統學派還在那裏以陳舊不堪的理論自欺欺人。所以我覺得應該灌輸一些正確的理論給一般讀者。我的文字裏面所說的，都不過是應用固有的工具，解釋眼前的事實，决沒有新發明的理論。說到恐慌週期率，十八世紀的學者，就已經得着一些概念。在十九世紀的初期，走馬燈式的恐慌週期律，便遂高倡入雲。而螺旋式的恐慌週期律，却在十九世紀的末葉才發明。然而目下的正統學派，老還是應用十九世紀初期的走馬燈式的恐慌週期律，所以我要加以糾正。我的文字裏面「吾人」兩個字，自然是指「我們的一派」，而不是指我個人。</p>
<h3 id="c180">「生產合理化」和「怎樣奮鬭」的問題 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>丨朱嬰君來信丨</p>
<p>關於翁崇實君的問題，我前後幾次參加討論。本月一日沈亦民君對於我的所謂「生產合理化」一語有所解釋，早想來信答辨。因事冗便擱置了。今天又讀到翁君來信，並要和我們直接討論。我就在雪花紛落的時候，耐著苦冷寫這封信，作分别的答複。</p>
<p>第一··答復沈君的。當然，沈君所解釋的一切，大部分是對　，然而我的所謂「由於生產合理化的結果使你一天精疲力盡而得不著一飽」，這句話並沒有什麽毛病，並不與沈君所解釋的相衝突，爲什麽呢？沈君所解釋的難有四點，然内容却只是以極少的人工時間與物質能生產大量的生產品，要知道在這幾項條件之下，一個工人是否有餘裕的時間？是否要　機器的速度而加增其工作　度？男一方面，　　　　愈速，因之生產品愈加過剩，以致形成經濟恐慌，而資本家救濟的方法，便是關閉工廠，開除工人，减少工資，···從這樣看來，「由於生產合理化的結果使你一天精疲力盡而得不著一飽」。這句話是可以成立。自然「生產合理化」的結果並不只如此。然抽出其結果的一部分來說，爲邏輯上並不曾犯了什麽規律。至於「恐朱君因咀咒現在社會的生產合理化，並將來合理社會的生產合理化而亦厭惡之，反對之，」沈君說話的根據。便是「蘇聯的計畫經濟也就是透露了此一端倪，」換句話說：便是蘇聯的經濟組織也是實行「生產合理化。」不論在蘇聯似乎還沒聽到這個名詞，就令將來眞呌嶺「生產合理化」，然資本主義的自由平等，與社會主義的自由平等，是截然兩樣的。所以我們現在提出「生產合理化，」無疑義的，是指資本主義的經濟組織而言。再··我對記者先生要說的··記者先生說··「朱君身在病中，···遂不睱做冷靜精密的分析，」或者是記者先生替我護短的意思，我當然感謝，其實我並沒生病，否。我向來就沒生過病，那怕在「資方的壓榨中」。附此一笑。</p>
<p>第二：答復翁君的。翁君的信，記者先生答復的很詳細了。現在我在此地要更進一言的，便是：㈠要選擇目標。記者先生說：「只要能夠知道你的吃苦由來就得，」這句話，很值得我們的玩味的，要曉得現在社會上誰給我們的痛苦，我們就要去推翻他，誰給我們的幸福，我們就要去擁護他：看看世界上那一部分是痛苦的社會，那一部分是幸福的社會，便不難推想而得，并且我們要知道在這兩者之間有一種拿改良方法來欺騙我們的，我們不要跟着他們走，而且事實上已經證明這些人是常常站在我們的敵對一面。㈡要立定脚跟。一個人在社會奮鬥的進程中間　不但從一般人得不到了角，便是自己的至親丨父子，兄弟，妻，···也是得不到了解的。在這裏，就可以看出我們一個人的人格，有些人或者能跳出這　環境，有些人便隨著他們隋落下去了。最好我們能學劉伶的飲酒，他的妻勸他戒飲，他口頭上答應，而事實上騙得了一次狂飲仍是五斗一石的「婦人之言愼勿聽」了。（有學識的女子當然除外）像翁君夫人的見解，自然難怪；然翁君在這時候，不但不應受她的　化，更應堅持自己的「三戒主義」，不，將來從消極個人的修養進而爲積極社會的改革的時候，他的夫人或者更加干涉，那末，翁君就應更加和她奮鬥了。㈢要相信自己。只要有正確的目標，只要自己的立塲站稳了，那末，就要相信自己。因爲有好些人看到一種偉大的事業，尤其是改革社會的事業，便覺得自己太渺小，是萬不能　到的。其實我是社會一份子，我盡我的一份力量，别人盡别人的一份力量，總合起來便成了偉大的力量。同時以我的堅决的奮鬥，可以影響别人的堅决的奮鬥。「九層之臺起於壘土，」只要一點一滴的做去，爘爛光明的世界可以爲我們今天别人看到一錢不值的人所能做到的。</p>
<p>另外，翁君要我們把通信處告訴他，旣承記者先生介紹，以後或者直接和他通信，或者借本報通信，頂好還是借本報通信，一來我們個人的問題，便是大家的問題，二來等記者先生參加意見，對我們有莫大的帮助，我想記者先生和　　當　以　　的。</p>

<p>第三章業務之情形</p>
<p>再加上些洋官廳式的氣燄，使一般民衆感覺到醫院的可怕，甚而至於拿醫院來代表外國人的面目，而中國人自辦的醫院，就只紅十字會醫院和上海公立醫院等幾處規模不大，經濟欠充，竟不能夠　多　工作。近二十年來，方始多了些勞工醫院，及幾個醫學校的附屬醫院，加上市外那些小規模公立醫院，大大小小，不下二三十處，我如今把上海公立醫院，酌量列成下表，並且分别他的性質，科目，和規模大小，註出來，請讀者參看，但是滄海遺珠，在所不免，如有漏列，還請指敎。</p>

<p>此外從略</p>
<p>表中的所謂規模，乃是根據房屋與設備，平均計算，而病房的等級中，所稱高級，乃是指普通人連他們的三等，都擔負不起，而所稱中級，，乃是病房太不考究，一般資本家，已經不屑住，所稱平民，竟近乎多收貧民而已，非普通中產人民所願住，惟有各級的，似乎包羅最富。然而病房價目，各院也還有參差，大都三等病房，每天收費在五角以上，就使貧民却步；二等病房收費，在二元以外，中人之資，出就嫌貴了。就右表年來，可分别下面幾點：㈠所列三十個醫院中間，規模較大的十二處，却有九處是洋辦；㈡專爲平民而設的醫院有七處，却有三處，是治霍亂的，一個是產科，與其他各病不相干涉；（但急救時疫醫院，在非霍亂期内，每日送診給藥，为取分文。）㈢三十個醫院中，只有三個醫院呈婦科，並且兒科還是附帶在婦科上，床位之少，可想而知，假使以全市小兒數做比例，就相差太遠；㈣產科醫院雖多，但是地方公立性質的很少，本表所以僅僅酌量列入，但是也嫌不彀。</p>
<p>照上面幾點看來。上海市的醫院狀况，實在可以說還在畸形之下，換一句俗語講，簡直軟硬不匀。得狠至於公立醫院的所以少呢，也有幾個原因，如今也把他來談談：</p>

<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>㈤胎兒</p>
<p>（甲）姙娠前半期···胎兒甚小，浮於羊水中·其位置時常變更；</p>
<p>（乙）姙娠後半期···胎兒長大·位置不能再變，於是有一定的胎位；</p>
<p>（丙）直產···直產或名順產，約有百分之九十九，爲直產，分頭位，頭在下，臀位，臀在下，下肢位，脚或膝在下，此三種以頭在下爲最多，約佔百分之九十六；</p>
<p>（丁）横產···即胎兒之直徑，與子宫直徑，交叉而成，約沾百分之一，按俗云分娩時，胎兒須掉頭，這句話，是完全不能成立的；</p>
<p>（戊）資勢···胎兒在子宫内，於姙娠後半期，才有固定的姿勢，取土耳其人打坐式，頭向胸前俯屈，背灣曲，上肢在胸前相叉，下肢向上腹部前灣曲；</p>
<p>（己）胎兒的營養···在姙娠最初三星期中，卵子固有自己的營養，第四星期，由脫落膜吸收營養物，以後臍帶組織成立，則由臍帶中之血管輸送，胎兒之排泄物，大半亦由臍帶運回母體；</p>
<p>（庚）胎動···在姙娠第五月起，孕婦自己覺得胎兒在腹内運動，此乃胎兒之軀幹四肢，伸縮而起。</p>
<p>㈥姙娠的狀態</p>
<p>（甲）各種象徵如下：</p>
<p>（一）素來月經準確，現忽停止；</p>
<p>（二）小便　數，在妊娠二三月内因子宫向上長大，膀胱被壓迫之故；</p>
<p>（三）惡心嘔吐，發現在妊娠二三月之際，或在第一月已有此症狀者，初在清晨發作，爲數　多！</p>
<p>（四）乳房自妊娠第二月起，微腫而脹，　之覺精，乳量色素呈赤褐色，乳頭突出，至四五月之間，試壓乳部，已有稀薄乳汁擠出；</p>
<p>（五）腹部膨大，妊娠第一月，子宫如鴿蛋大，第二月，大如鵝蛋，第三月，如兒頭大，以上三月，子宫祇在骨盆腔内增大，腹部外面，已能顯明觸知，至第四月，子宫上昇，入腹腔，滿五月，子宫移與臍窩齊，第八月，子宫底在臍與胸骨尖之間，至第九月，子宫底在胸骨尖，第十月，因向腹壁前屈，反降低，與第八月同。</p>
<p>（乙）各種變態如下：</p>
<p>（丨）妊娠線··經產婦至第九十月，其腹部皮膚，發現淡紅色或紫紅色之條紋，此即前次妊娠之舊瘢痕：</p>
<p>（二）初覺胎動···妊婦初覺腹内胎動時。約在第四五月之間；（第二十星期）</p>
<p>（三）子宫收縮···試將手指置於姙婦腹部子宫底處，即覺所按處由微硬而變更硬，漸漸復軟，但不能確定已受孕或未受孕：</p>
<p>（四）生殖器變化···陰户與陰道兩處之搆粘膜，較平時肥厚，而變爲顯明的紫色皺辟，陰户周圍之肌肉增殖，陰户腔擴大且增長，大陰唇有時呈漲大之靜脈；</p>
<p>（五）陰道之分泌物，較平時爲多，温度亦較增高；</p>
<p>（六）子宫頸···較平時務軟，姙娠初期，子宫頸呈淡紫色，至姙娠末期，呈藍色，頸形較短；</p>
<p>（七）骨盆關節···姙娠時，骨盆關節，都能鬆懈，分娩時，其關節并稍能移動，</p>
<p>（八）心臟變更位置···子宫增大時，將腹内諸臟器，悉向後方壓迫，或向側方或向上，將横隔膜上推，致心臟移動，其原有位置；</p>
<p>（九）靜脈瘤···姙娠後半期，腿部與肛門（痔）常現靜脈怒漲，倘平時已有者，則此時更見加劇；</p>
<p>（十）肺受壓迫···腹部非常漲大時，横隔膜向上壓，致肺受壓迫，呼吸時，兩肩扦動；</p>
<p>（十一）神經系統···姙婦神經，因受姙娠之攪亂，性情改變，時呈齒痛頭痛骨痛眩暈等症，并常改變其嗜好，喜怒憂鬱無定，亦有神經敏捷，而非常活潑者；</p>
<p>（十二）消化系統···除噁心嘔吐外，尙有流涎吐涎胃灼痛，大便秘結等；</p>
<p>（十三）全身變化···有時受孕後，較平時身體健全，有時起全身變化，并甚複雜，有時在姙娠起始，即發現，有時在末期始發現，但均不得謂爲疾病，不過變化之强弱，因人之身體而異；</p>
<p>（十四）皮膚色素異常···除乳暈呈紫褐色外，其他眼瞼下現黑圈，顏面額部頸部腹部中線均呈黃色，或褐紫色之斑點，雖美貌之婦人，亦常變色；</p>
<p>（十五）　揉的姿勢···姙婦因腹部向前突出，致上軀向後屈直，以保持其重心，故步行時，雖駝背，亦屬如是。</p>

<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>本刋第一期，　人　了一　［我輩心目中的良醫和一班心目中的良醫，　受讀者的謬　，以爲現社會的混亂，和智識上的無皂白，致造成一班　亂分子的機會，將使社會情形，　　黑暗，眞是最可痛心的事，不過我想過渡時代的混雜，爲世間一切的公例，因爲無論什麽事物的變遷和進化，都是有階級的，有階級，便當遞代，而遞代之間，即不能不發生各種的不全現象，和變態事物。所以我們現社會，正在變遷和進化時期，當然有光怪陸離，意想不到的各種事物發生，不過遞代期間的各分子，不能表現同一的階級，因爲他們的變遷和進化的速度，各自不同，比方我輩，也是現社會的一個分子，爲什麽我輩的心目，和一班的心目，有不同呢？這便是變遷和進化的速度上，纔有關係。上次我不曾說過了嗎，現在我們中國社會間的分子，智識觀念的距離，相去有二三千年上下，在同一時代爲社會中，智識觀念，相離太遠，當然不能無我輩和一班之慨了。</p>
<p>現在我又要說說藥的智識觀念了，茲原是治疾病的物質，能達治病目的的，便是良藥，不能達的，便不是良藥，似乎是一個很簡單的問題，又有什麽我輩和一班的不同呢，不錯，但是良藥兩字，最不易名實相符，有眞正是良藥，而未經證實的，有比較的良藥，而尙待改良的，有雖然是良藥，而未明用法的，還有許多名義的良藥，廣告的良藥，什麽什麽的良藥，其間程度的高下，和認識的不同，眞呌見智見仁，一言難盡，治病目的的能不能達，恐怕沒有一個眞僞的標準，吧世上困難避楚人之咻，所以不能不使屈大夫，有瓦釜黃　之歎，而良藥之究竟良不良，終至墮入五里霧中了。</p>
<p>我輩心目中，現在希望的良藥，和認識的良藥，並不因爲抱能治愈了一個或幾個人的疾病，便算滿意，而眞正藥之良否，却不可不具備下面所寫的各個條件。我輩所認爲良藥，第一要補充或抑减發生一種疾病局部的變常質量，而復其原狀；換一句說，是恢復解剖學上原狀的質量，不是恢復生理學上動作的本能，比方像中風，我們知是腦出血，倘然能把腦中之變化恢復牠的原狀，當然中風自愈，還有比方像糖尿病，我們知是腴臟島質的變化，倘然能把變態復舊，那末糖尿病，自然全愈，能解决這類解剖學上變化的藥，方是我輩心目中的第一等良藥。其次的呢，便是恢復局部生理的本能，而不妨他部的藥物，比方像胃痛牠的生理變常，祗限局在胃，我們用止痛苦，貴在用局部止痛，換一句說，祗要止胃的痛，不要作用到其他不痛部分的藥，方算適當。現在大部用些Ｃｏｃａｉｎ等局部麻醉藥對付，算是上乘了，但是這類藥品，吸收入體内，還要引起許多的副作用，至於萬痛一針的嗎啡屬類，和麻痺未梢的河豚毒素等，有普通麻醉性的藥，那更落下乘了，還有比方像毛地黃的特作用於心肌Ａｔｒｗｐｉｎ的特作用於瞳孔括約肌，同一肌肉，而牠的效用特著，果然是頗有價値的藥，不過對於此外的副作用，究竟還不能免，所以我輩很希望的恢復局部生理功用之外，還要不妨牠部的藥，方才可算第二等良藥，至於殺菌藥呢，本也可算是制伏病原的一種要藥，但是現在對於體外的殺菌藥，是很多，而體内的殺菌藥，却不很見，因爲體内殺菌，必須顧到投鼠忌器的一層，倘然有殺菌力量的藥品，便可殺害生體細胞，所以要求一種細菌毒愈烈，而生體細胞毒愈弱的藥品，今日眞不易多見，譬如像六○六，便是對生體細胞，是弱毒，對細菌，是强毒，又像金鷄納，對生體細胞，是弱毒，對胞子蟲，是强毒，還有各種動物免疫血清，也對生體細胞，是弱毒，對各種傳染病菌，是强毒，這類的藥品，今日旣不多見，又不滿意，而要想求一種對病原體强毒，對生體細胞無毒的良藥，却頗難得，若有這種藥，可算我輩心目中的第三等良藥了，此外一藥的作用很多，將其中一種較强的功用，算是主效的藥品，正是汗牛充楝，名稱複雜，配製各殊，考牠的實在，還不是變相的同質藥是什麽呢，這類藥品，今日應用上最繁，而醫家最苦於無法澈底解决疾病，把牠列入第四五等，也不算苛吧，所以我輩心目中的良藥第一等，可恢復解剖學上變態的質量，第二等，可恢復生理學上局部的本能，第三等，方才算到體内殺滅病菌的物質，其他修補枝枝節節的部分，而目下最普徧的對症藥品，只好列入第四五等了。</p>
<p>請到一班心目中的良藥呢，那完全與我輩的認識不同，他們中樞的判斷力。早被耳目兩官支配，他們良藥的功效，完全受了精神的指使，所以他們的良藥，是宣傳的良藥，是心理的良藥，與藥的本來目的和本能，幾乎可以說風馬牛的不相反，這種藥品，沙泥也好，香灰也好，無論什麽草根樹皮，沒一樣不好，因此千奇百怪的東西，大吹大播的宣傳，充斥了我們神州禹域，眞是目迷五色，耳觀五聲，差不多誰也辨不出東西南北了，不過話是這樣說，一班認爲良藥中間，出要分個高下，因爲一班的良藥，原來都屬成藥，換一句說，就是民間藥，這類藥物的性質，是將病就藥，不是合藥應病，所以和醫家開方所合的對症藥品，趨向不同，但竟成藥之中，也有合乎科學原理，確是科學製品，而爲醫家所歡迎應用的東西，可是大部分，都是不入軌道，或全屬欺騙的僞物，瞞着無醫藥常識的民衆，吸收婦女和窮苦人們的金錢爲目的，比較上等些的，効用和藥質，還相近，但總不免言過其實，最下等的，牠所說的功用，是功用，藥質是藥質，張冠李戴，信口開河，這眞呌做糟糕哩，近來我看到有一個廣告，說是有一種國產藥稱做什麽素的，他說有二百萬倍强大的化痰止嗽力，數學上講到倍數，必須先有個單位，這個化痰止嗽効力單位，我可不知怎樣計算，倘然沒有單位，而稱二百萬倍，不是滑天下的大稽嗎，比方像這種的効藥距離太遠，或完全南轅北轍的藥品，而被他瞞着受他麻醉的一部人們，出許當牠是一種良藥，也未可知，還有什麽草，什麽精，什麽什麽丸散膏丹日月星夜，他吹聽的吸引的，都是些望界外的人們，他榨取的誘致的，都是一般可憐蟲的金錢，而這類可憐蟲，他還自以爲聰明絶世，能選得世界精進的妙藥，起死回生，那眞是可憐到底了，我從前在海外，也曾調查過各國管理成藥的標準，他的寬嚴，較有出入，有必須對於某症有効，方稱合格的，有但求無毒無碍生理，便算合格的，不過至少有方藥合答，效藥不離的拘束，所以藥的廣告法，很是重要，很是嚴格，唉，　們現在的情狀，我不曉得從何說起才好，寫到這裏，也只好擱筆了。</p>
<h3 id="c221">糾正非科學醫藥之反響就有急切提倡國產藥物的需要 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 胡定安</p>
<p>世界上一切的事，有了因，才有果；有了對象，才有動機，然後再發生反響。我們知道軍閥的虐民病民。於是才有國民革命，我們知道經濟的壓迫，才要抵制資本侵略！學術上也何獨不然？我們看了非科學醫的誕妄，和近來在海上有種非科學藥的欺誑，我們爲着中國醫藥學術前途打算，就因了這個反響，不得不起來做這個提倡國產藥物的科學化運動。</p>
<p>我們看到中國西藥和中藥舖子來自外洋的藥物，每年這大批漏巵，整個和國家經濟發生危險的影響，同時我們看到國内應着潮流想做些投機勾當，把國產藥物又不能夠按着科學方法來創製，只有靠着廣告來騙中國同胞，并且只能騙到沒有醫藥常識的同胞，科學上的根基失了重心，這樣提倡非科學的藥，和非科學醫并行的謬妄與錯誤，有同一底方向。原來提倡國產藥物是一椿很好的事情，不過借了國產藥物，并不按着科學方法來創製，表面上就算挽回利權，可以代替舶來品的功用，這種非科學的藥，實在不是我們要提倡創製科學化的國產藥物底原意。因爲這於學術上得不到進步的利益，都不是澈底的辦法，所以我們爲着要急起直追，應目前的迫切需要起見，全國醫藥界同志，自當完全用科學的方法，把國產藥物，擇其首先應該創製的幾種，或是已經有報名的幾種，按着製藥程序來製造，必須立定了　學上的基礎，再進而求其他各種的　　。藥學家從分析方面，求得主要成分應用藥理來試於動物試騐，醫學家從藥理方面來鑒定藥物治療的功用，有些不能一時把主要成分分析出來報告的，儘可陸續地研究，似乎我們先可把已有把握的幾種提前來實騐，得了結果，先來製造，的確要從良心上獲了在科學界可以報告的眞實憑據才算對某種藥物可以創製來應用於人類，作爲治療藥物。固然非科學藥流行於社會，不醫病，不送命，并不算一定很爲重大弊害，倘若在國際上沒有科學根據的報告，學術界就絲毫不發生影響，或則以秘方秘製來遮蓋一切弱點，照樣如法泡製，那末就可以應用到各種藥物，假使含有狠劇烈的成分，也以爲無關緊要，含糊創製，恐怕一定要發生狠大的流弊和危險吧。從這樣說來，科學方法的製藥，用國產藥物來製藥，有一定的程序，有一定的製藥手續，更有一定的科學研究，這也可算是我們提倡國產藥物，要打算創製時候底最低標準。希望新醫藥界同仁爲挽回利權！爲昌明學術，積極想法來創製國產藥物，就是舊醫界能夠認識大勢，跳出玄學移入科學界來投誠，我想參加提倡國產藥物工作，也是一椿國民天職上分内的事。中藥舖子也應當供給材料，襄成大舉，所謂科學救國，在這種緊要關頭，憑科學智識，用科學方法，創製國產樂物，還不是狠明白的事實麽？</p>

<p>到處鬧着匪患農村經濟崩潰</p>
<p>生產大開倒車輸出一落千丈</p>
<p>贛省物產豐饒、其中以瓷器、木材、茶葉、紙張、夏　、等特產、尤爲本省輸出入宗、每年貿易總値常達三四千萬元、近年匪患蔓延全省、各地物產、日就衰微、農村經濟、隨之破產、地方窮乏、概可想見、茲將贛省近年瓷茶紙木材、各　概况、調查略述如次、以見贛省重要實業衰退之一班、</p>
<p>瓷器</p>
<p>景德瓷器素著盛名、其品質精良、價値名貴、數百年來爲人盛道勿衰、不僅在國内首屈一指、卽泰西亦早馳名、民十六以前、出產最盛、平均每年總値、約在一千萬元、其銷路遠及於南洋歐美各國、最近據陶務局調查、瓷業行類總數計二十三家、窰陶行廠、共一千五百零四户、工人二萬二千零二十九人、資本一百五十三萬五千八百八十五元、全年出產總値、五百六十萬零六千一百五十一元、與十六年前較、實减少四百餘萬元、其衰落之原因有二、十六年前、景埠共有福祿壽大小錢莊七十餘家、金融　呈活動、如瓷客帶鎭申票一萬元、購辦瓷器、卽可將申票售於錢莊、錢莊只付其支條、不　數目、（自百元至二元）隨時可以兌現、流通市塲、買賣均稱便利、故當時銀根舒暢、貿易隨之　展、十六年以後戰事頻仍、金融緊急、申票呼應不靈、錢莊所出支條、亦擱淺不能貼現、於是信用盡失、市面遂難流通、最老的殷實錢莊、亦縮小營業範圍、多主審愼放欵、此瓷業受經濟窘迫之影響而致衰落者一、前歲　邵赤匪、迭次陷掠、瓷業受損頗巨、九一八事變後、東三省銷路、完全滯塞、營口·哈埠·關東·各帮、均裹足不來、此外他省或因軍　關　、交通梗　、難於運售、此又受軍事匪患　影響因而衰落者又一、前年建廳鑒瓷產之退化、毅然起而負拽導改良之責、特於廳内設置窰業部、以研求瓷業之改良、分設一陶務局於景德鎭、除担任技術事務外、並負瓷業上一切指導之責、辦理以來、雖漸見成效、但仍無澈底改良、今春又因滬戰影響、銀根奇緊、瓷各行、困於經濟、業務上又不　依計畫如願做云、兼之省府爲辦清匪產銷捐、於影鎭設立專局、徵收瓷捐、瓷商負担加重九月　曾一度罷市停業、上月雖經滬市商會主席王曉　等率瓷業代表親至贛面請當局撤銷、改徵營業稅、年比額定　四十四萬、較之瓷產稱盛之年、瓷商負担未見少减且自秋節後、爲瓷器淡銷之季、各省瓷客、多賦歸去、又因年關在邇、金融緊閉異常、月來　鎭開燒之窰、僅十餘家、瓷器出品、竟　無人問及、市况蕭條、爲近年未有、瓷業前途、殊無進展樂觀、</p>
<p>茶葉</p>
<p>贛省向爲長江西部產茶、最富之區、如德興·玉山·之綠茶·修水·河口·浮梁·之紅茶、均爲本省出口大宗、茶葉鼎盛之年、修水洋莊紅茶、年有產額十六七萬箱、河口二三萬箱、德興在民十七年、亦出產至二萬餘箱、浮梁四萬餘箱、近十年來修水武寗紅茶、初因俄銷之不勁、售價低微　業茶者迭遭虧折、於　徽粤外帮入山設號開塲者、逐年减少、山户因茶價低賤、大多斫去茶樹、易植他種物產、未斫者亦不加人力肥料之整理培壅質味因而漸劣、洋商辦茶者　至是多舍寗紅而樂取祁紅、至近年產額、益形銳减、今歲入山開辦者、僅本帮寥數家而已、河口紅茶、因質味尤　於寗產、洋商又提高抑低、營業亦呈　振、本年河口營紅茶者、只有　家、營玉山綠茶者三家、出產總額不過萬箱左右、較之十年前、均减　遠甚、德興綠茶、因產地接壤婺源、質味不惡、前歲出產、仍有萬餘箱、自去歲共匪盤踞　今淪爲匪區、農民至新茶發育期不能及時採製、茶葉放棄於地、兩年無出產惟浮梁紅茶、依傍祁門之聲價、得碩果之僅存但本年因銀根緊迫關係、茶棧放匯收縮、開塲者亦不及往年之多、製出之茶、又受洋商之抑價、虧折甚大、浮茶命運、漸趨狹途、將與修水紅茶同呈日薄崎　之勢矣、最近上海商品檢騐局、爲明瞭修水茶葉衰落之實際情形、四月間曾派員至贛調查、並將改進意見呈報實業部、對復興茶業計劃、頗爲周密近熊主席鑒於寗茶不振、亦將組織大規模之公司在九江設立製造廠、爲挽救垂危之茶業、上述兩項設備如能見諸實施、則修水紅茶、尙有一線希望、是　贛省茶業墮入深淵中、加以援手之可喜消息也、</p>
<p>紙張</p>
<p>江西居揚子江中部之南岸、氣候温和、到處竹林葱翠產竹之盛、爲全國冠、故其紙業之發達、亦天然之勢也、全省領縣八十有人、產紙縣分、占本縣分之半數以上、其中產額最多者、以　吉安府、　州府　　府四屬、袁州府廣信府撫州府建昌府四屬次之、其產額較多　分、又爲石　泰和宜春等縣、全省操製紙業者、有六千九百餘户、工人三萬人、細紙種類、如連史毛邊宣紙　心皮紙户關油紙表心及仿造洋紙等、粗紙如中表心花箋袁表宣表棉　次表碧州次表良口捆表小紙、細紙以毛邊連史貢川奏木竹紙白　譜紙等爲主、毛邊年產額約百萬元、連史年產額約百五十萬元、其他各種細紙、合計之約五十萬元、粗製紙中以　紙火紙年產額約四萬元、集中於吳城奉新靖安所產之火紙、年產額約百萬元、以及他方消費數量、合計之總額、亦爲三百萬元、據民國七年之調查、全省粗細紙總產額、爲八百一十一萬六千百六十三元、近年贛州奉新靖安火紙、在華北　路、一落千丈、其原因卽因製法不求改良、除供費化祭祀用外、無他用途、目因華北近漸破除迷信、此種用途、大爲减少、益以本省產紙區、連年不靖、運輸爲難、業此者　興趣消極、產額因之銳减、前之在華北一帶銷數約在三百萬元、今則不過數十萬元、兼之上海等處機器製紙廠所出之毛邊連史、又較贛產爲優、價値又廉、向之銷用贛紙者、今多購用上海各廠出品、毛邊連史銷塲、又被滬紙攘奪其半、故贛省紙業、勢將從此退化、實難恢復昔日之繁榮矣、</p>
<p>木材</p>
<p>贛省各縣多山、夙以產木著名、其大宗爲贛南之贛州龍南瑞金上猶崇義遂川等處之杉木、次如樟木、杉木以贛州所產爲最優、因贛州上游山地肥沃、氣候温和、最宜植木、所產木材、堅細身長、經久耐用、除常德所產之廣木外、可稱吾國杉木中之良材、銷路以江蘇爲大宗、次銷本省及皖蕪各埠、出口木材、均自產地運至吳城集中、製編木筏、經鄱湖直放南京入口卸編小筏、運入常州銷售、常州爲贛鄂木材集中之區、所售木料、又多贛產、每年銷數總値、約在七百餘萬元、合之銷於皖蕪及本省者、年約八百萬元、若以價値言、則較曩昔增加、以產量言、則較昔年减少、蓋民國初年、西木價値、約十零貫·今則激增至四五十貫、價値之巨、四倍於昔、近　年來贛南產木各縣、大半爲匪蹂躪、運輸艱阻、本年常州各木行、因蘇省絲業衰落、各縣繭價不起、農民經濟困難、無力從事建造、木材需要、大爲折减、常行往年每家銷售木材百餘萬元者、今歲只及二三十萬元、臨江及徽　營西木者、大多囤積、無從銷售、杉木本年在蘇省銷塲已陷於不振境地、至樟木雖合銷於北省及本省製造木器皮箱之用、但產額銷數、僅及杉木十分之一、於木材消長無足輕重也、</p>
<p>夏布</p>
<p>贛屬苧蔴、產量至富、夏布出產、亦較他省爲多、產地以萬載宜眷崇仁撫州等縣爲最巨、寗都河口玉山等縣次之、其出口行銷於中外各大商埠、每年總値、約在五百萬元、各縣夏布質料、以萬載所產者爲最優、在國内與湖南瀏陽所產者同稱上品、海外銷路、以美國朝鮮需要爲多、如江西女子工　社出品之西餐台布、尤爲美人所歡迎、無如近兩年來、夏布產地、大多淪爲匪區、男女</p>
<p>工人、不能安心工作、出產减退、朝鮮銷塲、又因我國抵制日貨、日政府對吾國夏布輸入　邦者、加以限制、銷數頓少、今歲各縣夏布之產銷數量、僅及往年十分之四云、</p>
<h3 id="c224">一年來我國絲業之回顧 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 趙鼎元</p>
<p>比年以來、正是我國絲業沒落時期、及至最近一二年間、其尖銳化之程度、已達極點、整個絲業、已在風雨飄搖之破產狀態中、下　養蠶之農民、上至經營絲業之商人、旁及通融資金之銀錢二業、無不陷於深切之痛苦地位而莫可自拔、</p>
<p>生絲爲吾國國際貿易中之主要商品、其失敗影響於全體經營絲業之農工商二者、互有密切之關、而莫能例外也、一自世界不景氣　潮展佈後、含有奢移品性質之生絲、當然先遭波及、海外需要、頓然减少、存貨無法脫售、於是吾國絲商絲廠、陷於擱淺之窘境、抵押於銀錢業之絲繭、無法取贖、遂至紛紛倒閉、工人失業者日增勞資糾紛、於焉開始、及至一二八以後而　甚、</p>
<p>絲商對於抵押之絲繭、旣無法取贖、金融資金大受其累、一方固無法再　通融·而絲商更陷於困境、他方因繭子不能久藏、乃不得不代絲廠設法　製、以免暴殄天物、兼以改少損失也、淞滬戰後、頗有一部份絲廠、藉代　陳繭度日、景况至慘也、</p>
<p>我國絲業之末落、非今日始、引起全國之注意、朝野上下、競競焉以急謀出路、如組織江浙陳廠絲推銷委員會、及設立江浙陳廠絲陳繭委員會、政府亦亟亟提倡、發行公債、力求補救者何出、蓋今春絲業之末落、與一般絲商無甚關係、而直接影響於育蠶之農民、農民僅有之區區資金、不堪受意外重大之打擊、於是農村破產之聲浪、頓形緊張、社會秩序、頗有紛擾之勢、其故當以本年絲商鑒　海外絲市之銷沈、陳貨過多、金融不靈、袖手觀望、繭價絲價（按此　指土絲）步跌、幾至無人過問、與往年之競買、因不可以道里計、絲業之　落已有年、而去年春、一般絲商、尙未知世界經濟恐慌、至於此極、故仍廣爲搜買、卒至絲商太虧其本、今春絲商鑒於去年之失敗、力圖緊縮、繭價暴跌、而農民苦矣、故去年　絲市衰落、商人蒙其害、本年則農人獨受其　、農民多貧苦、豈　受巨大之風浪、於是農村破產之聲、一時暄囂於外人之口矣、（請參考工商半月刋第四卷第二十三號拙作輯里湖絲調查記一文）、</p>
<p>本年上半年之絲市、萬分沈寂、海外來電、索價太低、以至陳絲裹足不前、意存觀望、但至七八月之匀、里昂紐約等處生絲市塲、忽形活躍、絲價漲風甚厲、五國是時生絲出口、一時頓形踴躍、故本年吾國生絲貿易、就大體看來、較之往年爲佳、茲根據最近生絲檢騐處之［每星期生絲出口報告、以說明本年生絲出貿易之概况、</p>
<p>年份　　運歐包　　　運亞洲及　　運美包　　出口總數</p>
<p>非洲包</p>
<p>十九　　一五一九七　六六九一　一七六九四　三九五八二</p>
<p>二十　　　八四九五　四八00　一一二八七　二四五八二</p>
<p>廿一　　　九四一六　八六五一　　七二五五　二五三二二</p>
<p>吾人就上述數字審察之、本年出口總數、雖不及民十九、但已超過民二十無疑、此當然歸功於政府極力提倡救濟之力、如消極的毅然豁免每包三十海關兩之出口稅、更積極的撥給補助費、計每擔一百兩、再加以江浙陳廠絲推銷委員會之有組織的向海外市塲努力推銷、無如世界不景氣依然籠罩、故雖有各方羣策羣力、其效果尙未大著耳、</p>
<p>歐洲諸國如法國·瑞士·意大利·本爲中國百十年來之老主顧、（意大利本亦爲產絲之國、但其絲做工較華絲爲佳、故一方販賣於美國、以圖厚利、同時補進價廉之華絲、）其於華絲頗能信仰、故定貨源源而來、出口貿易、遂有上昇之勢、　表中所謂亞洲、實指印度而言、印度迄今尙在英人掌握之中、工業至爲幼稚、生活程度、自屬較低故上等白廠絲、非彼所需求、而價廉之輯里絲、遂大合彼之脾胃、據輯里絲產地之震澤絲商言、彼之定貨、每次二三包四五包不等、鮮有超出十餘包者、惟來電則源源不絶、終年如一日也、輯里絲之最大毛病、是在條份匀度之不佳、是也不適於　製之大量生產、致小量之手工業、固頗適宜也、印度今日尙未脫離手工業時代、故輯里絲遂以印度爲大主顧矣、</p>
<p>惟是　銷則有江河日下之勢、其故有二、㈠國爲大量之機械生產、故匀度最爲注意、而　國能合於其八十分以上匀度之所準者甚少、即有之、絲牌淆亂、名目繁多、於是同一絲牌之數產自屬較少、每次二三百包之定貨、自然　於　付、缺少所謂標準化（Sｔａｎａｒｉｚａｔｉｏｎ）其故一也、㈡日本鑒於此種情形、遂乘機奪取美國市塲、一切出品、努力精進、務須商合於美國之需要、同時對於推銷及宣傳、不遺餘力、以是美國全部生絲消費之百份九十五、均爲日本所佔　、所餘卜者、區區零數耳、日本採用屯併政策、其故二也、</p>
<p>本年雖然仍在世界經濟恐慌高潮中、乃以朝野合力、卒能挽救垂絶之生機於萬一、由是言之、人力如眞能盡、自然頽勢、未嘗不可挽回、今後所宜注意者、㈠生產技術問題、㈡運銷合理問題、容再申論之、</p>
<h3 id="c225">蘇俄的消費生產合作事業 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 林秉中</p>
<p>列寗說、［唯有合作和電氣化、才能够建設社會主義、］又說［光明的合作制度、使公衆管理生產工具、使無產階級克服資產階級、就是社會主義制度、］這便是蘇俄合作事業極力擴張的原因、</p>
<p>論到蘇俄的合作事業、我們當然先　分析牠的目的、我們知道、現在世界上各個國家都有合作社的組織、他們的目的就是出售產品使社員得有最大的贏利、或者是使社員用最低的價格購買貨品、合作社之所以設立、可以說完全爲社員着想、但是蘇俄的合作事業便不盡然、固然合作社免不了爲牠的社員謀利益、但是社員的利益、只不過是蘇俄合作事業的次要目的、牠的主要目的、就是用做改革經濟和社會的工具、使能符合於俄羅期政黨的計劃和原則、所以我們與其　蘇俄的合作組織、爲世界合作運動的一部分、毋寗稱之爲蘇聯社會主義制度的一個機關、　因爲承認合作事業是改革社會經濟的一種工具、所以蘇聯的合作社完全操諸黨的手中、也就像工業·貿易·銀行事業等等之操諸國家一樣、合作社裏面的辦事員、合作社的政策等、莫不由黨來支配、</p>
<p>蘇俄的合作種類很多、但是最重要的兩種就是消費和生產合作、現在分述如下、</p>
<p>（Ａ）消費合作事業</p>
<p>消費合作事業、在各種合作事業中最爲重要、一九二九至一九三○年會計年度中、該合作社會的人數　四○·二五八·○○○人、佔全國人口總數百分之二四·八、凡是蘇聯國民、公權未被剥奪者、都有做社員的資格、在理論上論、人民人社與否、悉聽其自由、但是事實上、非社會有種種的不利、如限制購買貨品抬高價格等等、所以現在的趨勢、幾乎每個人都成爲社員了、</p>
<p>社員的社股原來是因定的、一九二四年　定爲五　布、但最近幾年内、徵取社股係根據於購買社股者的薪金、就是以一個月的薪金、做爲社股的數目、分期繳納、卽便社員已納社股的、也要補足這個數額、這樣人民的負担是加重了、但是要保存社員的種種利益、入社者仍有增無已、一九二八至一九三○年會計年度中社　已經增加到、一○○·○○○·○○○盧布、股利並不按期分配、因爲每一社員只有一股、股利爲數極小、用不着在簿記上增加許多麻煩、</p>
<p>消費合作事業、又可以　做一部分、㈠農村消費合作、㈡都市工人消費合作、㈢運輸工人消費合作、各個合作社都設立若干商店、各個商店之間都是相互聯絡的、就像美國的連環商店ＣｈａｉｎＳｔｏｒｅｓ一樣、</p>
<p>中央購買聯合社、Ｃｅｎｔｒｏｓｏｙｕｚ是各個消費合作社所共同組織的、牠的職務異常繁重、大約可分爲下列各點、</p>
<p>㈠消費合作社的代表機關、也可以說是消費合作社的領袖、</p>
<p>㈡設立堆棧、以儲存各商店的貨品、</p>
<p>㈢設置機器、以製造麵包、罐頭食品、肥皂等消費貨物以供全市人口之用、</p>
<p>㈣向國外購買貨品、現在蘇俄茶的貿易中央購買聯合社有獨占購買權、</p>
<p>㈤分配技術人員於各社、組織各社的會計制度、</p>
<p>㈥對於力量單薄的合作社、給以財政上的帮助、</p>
<p>現在蘇俄消費貨品的輸入、完全操諸中央購買聯合社手中、由合作商店來銷售、其中最重要的部分、就是飲食部、蘇俄最新式的住宅　沒有設備、各個家庭單獨烹調的地方、所以公共飯店和市廚的設立極多、這種飯店都是合作社設立的、</p>
<p>消費合作制度最重要的行政部就是黨、這種制度並非社員共同管理的、完全受黨的支配、管理人員也是社員所推選、但所推選的人一定要在黨所列的候選及名單之内、</p>
<p>（Ｂ）生產合作事業</p>
<p>蘇俄的生產合作事業也很發達、我們知道蘇俄的第一次五年計劃成功了、工業的進展、大有一日千里的狀况、這個功勞至少有一部分應當歸到國内的生產合作社的、蘇俄生產合作社的宗旨、可以說有三種、第一種宗旨就是把國内小規模工業引到社會主義的軌道之内、蘇俄的工業是取國有政策、所以不容獨立工廠或工人的存在、他們以爲工廠或工人獨立的時候、都爲個人的利益着想、所走的道路一定會同社會主義的發展相衝突、所以非要設法消滅不可、消滅的方法、不是歸併於國家工業、便是組織合作社使之社會主義化、第二種目的就是以生產合作社解决失業問題、生產合作社愈多、工業愈可發達、工人愈增加、這是一個很明顯的事實、第三種目的、就是解决貨物恐慌的問題、在這三種目的裏面、當然第一種是居於首　地位、</p>
<p>生產合作社也是盡量容納社員、在理論上講、人社與否、全憑個人的自由、但是事實上、非社員有種種的不利、一九三○年一月、政府頒佈一條命令、禁止供給非合作社社員的原料和購買他們的生活產品、這樣一來、非社員簡直無法生活、所以紛紛入社、一九二九年十月一日生產合作社社員已達一·四六○·○○○人、同年國内生產合作社所生產的貨品的總值爲二十四萬萬二千四百萬盧布、發達的一斑、於茲可見矣、</p>
<p>生產合作組織的基本單位稱爲［亞特兒］Ａｒｔｅｌ會員人數不限、或爲五六人、或爲千餘人、行政機關是一個委員會、委員普通都是三人、中一人爲委員長、他們的職務可分爲下列四種、</p>
<p>㈠計劃貨品的出售、</p>
<p>㈡做爲亞特兒的代表、</p>
<p>㈢採辦原料、</p>
<p>㈣總管日常一切行政事宜、</p>
<p>亞特兒裏面的工人（就是社員）也有工資、或者是每週每月付給、或者按照工作時間來計算、工資數額各不相同、但是有一最多限度、每一工人無論如何每月所得不能超過五百盧布、也不能多過國家企業中同種工作的工資、假若要有大利潤的時候、工人交換所ＬａｂｏｒＥｑｃｈａｎｇｅ就要設法在這裏面增加工人、以分取他們的工資、</p>
<p>亞特兒的社員都　繳納社欵、社欵有一最少的限度、力量充裕的人、在有需要的時候、須多出作爲、欵給亞特兒、這種放欵也有利息、大約由八厘到一分、若是力不能出社欵的社員、暫時可以不必繳納、而在每週的工資裏面漸次扣除、大約每次扣除由百分之五到百分之十五、因工資的大小而定、利潤並不分配於社員、而用於下列四種用途、</p>
<p>㈠百分之二十五作爲特别資本基金、存於全俄合作銀行、用以放欵於其他合作事業、</p>
<p>㈡百分之十繳納所得稅、</p>
<p>㈢發展本社的基金、</p>
<p>㈣建築聚樂部、以改進工人的生活、</p>
<p>各地的亞特兒聯合成地方生產合作社、這些地方合作社、又共同組織一個生產合作社、聯合大會、作爲設計和指導的機關、還有一種組織、稱爲全俄生產合作社聯合會、專司採辦原料、分配銀行信用和銷售出品、</p>
<p>結論我們討論了蘇俄的消費生產合作事業以後、我們知道蘇俄的合作事業是一種工具以促進社會主義化、一切都受黨的支配、這是與各國合作制度根本上不同的一點、也是我們所要特别注意的一點、固然蘇俄的合作事　種類還不只於此、如家政　獵、理髮等　有合作社的組織、尤其是農業合作、也很發逹、不過其重要性不如消　生產合作、所以本文概未論及、</p>

<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>富與貧</p>
<p>上海是中國最富的地方。中國經過歷年的戰爭，漸漸的把國内的　財　會吸收到租界中來，大概經過一次政變。租界户口必增加一次。中國的軍閥實足緊榮租界的大功臣，擴充租界的機會都是他們製造的。</p>
<p>能久居上海的寓公，大概　是中產階級以上的人家。他們來時，便携着全部動產同來。上海的强盜，眞正［兇來　］，洋　放在家裏實在勿放心，還是存入銀行比較妥當。爲適應這許多需要，上海的銀行便突然多起來了。</p>
<p>銀行除了新開的不算，舊有的還添設了許多分行，我們走東走西，都見有銀行分號開着。於是就有人預測，將來的銀行也許會到［擺攤頭］的地步。</p>
<p>銀行存欵多而放欵少，坐貼利息，就有［脹死］的危險。上海有了錢沒人用，這不是人富之象嗎？</p>
<p>但是，在銀行擺攤頭的對門，隔壁，時常會發現幾家掛大［押］字招牌的小押當。銀行雖多，尙不及小押當千萬份之一，銀行的營業雖佳，押頭店的生意更好因知上海是最富的地方，也是窮人最多的地方。尤其多的是形似富而實窮的［　　朋友］，此輩比眞窮人更難過。</p>

<p>— 江萍</p>
<p>丨安樂土在那裏丨</p>
<p>這幾天，因爲黷　主義者的咄咄逼人，所以北平居民離平日衆，遷地爲良。</p>
<p>回想到一年以前，多少家庭曾爲戰禍所燬滅，上海居民以爲是不會身受的：東三省全部人民的被害，上海居民以爲是不會步其後塵的；但事實是怎樣呢？結果是身受了，步其後塵了。然　，今日北平居民視租界作保險庫，内地爲安樂土的，到將來又安知不蹈前車的覆轍呢？看吧，人家是一步緊一步的向前進逼，我們假設一步鬆一步的往後倒退，請問一旦退到了海濱，你還想退到什麽地方去？所以現在的保險庫或安樂士，到將來怕不要成爲刀俎，而以我們全數作魚肉嗎？</p>
<p>所以，在今日，遷地爲良的意念，已屬不妥，秦越漠視的心理更應排除，旣不可甘作犧牲，亦不能以［退避三舍爲</p>

<p>— 蘇克蓀</p>
<p>丨國人作何感想丨</p>
<p>［知彼知己，百戰百勝。］這似乎成了一句口頭禪。但是。我們中國人雖然把話倒唸得熟，而事實上却很少做到這種工夫。比如說，研究某一種科學，我們中國人祇須跑到外國　去兩年，懂得了一點皮毛，馬上就回國來充什麽專家，專門學者。若果根究起來，雖是學問說不到如何高深，然而他滿口的洋文是夠使你默然的了。單講科學方面，現象如此，其他究竟做到［知彼］的程度沒有，祇有天曉得。</p>
<p>可是，外國人呢，他們在我國内地遍設敎堂，甚至一個鄉村也有的。什麽學術考察團，科學調查團，常一年幾次的在國内遍山遍地攢。這是爲了什麽？無非欲［知彼］而已。</p>
<p>最近四川的朋友，曾爲我寄了一份四川報紙來，那上面有一個消息使我很吃驚的，就是，成都華西大學的外國人，從東御街舊書店裏用重金搜去很多時志書，又派人到各縣去搜集，用外國文翻譯出來，寄回他本國去。據說這工作外國人已經進行很久了。還有的是華西一部分中國學生，甘作洋奴，而帮着翻譯。</p>
<p>外國人究竟爲了什麽，要翻譯我們的志書？這使我想起我們的中國文學史，常要到日本去翻譯來。特别是中國學生要帮忙外國人翻譯志書，這更妙了。怪不得帝國主義對中國一出兵，我們就沒有辦法了。</p>
<p>當着這國難的時候，我不知國人聽了這個消息，作何感想？</p>
<h3 id="c237">吃飯主義 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>丨任何人都當信仰丨</p>
<p>在這［主義滿天下］的時候，我們這大中華民國裏，［主義不敢後人］，一切舶來品的主義，倒也應有盡有，式式俱全。你瞧，資本，國家，共產，無政府，法西斯蒂等等主義者，多得滿坑滿谷，不知所云。一切等等主義，公有公理，婆有婆理，儘你反對者攻擊得體無完膚，信徒們兀呈奉行罔替，小子學識　陋，對於各種主義，莫測高深，可是　研之下，却發明了一個［吃飯主。</p>
<p>義］。</p>
<p>怎地呌做［吃飯主義］？［民以食爲天］，這是一句古話。不拘是誰，從一等大好老，以至白相人大亨，從我們這裏依筆爲活的文丐，以至伸手討錢的乞丐，總沒有一個能掛起了嘴不吃飯，所以吃飯是人生的第一大事。古時的人說：［餓死事小，失節事大］，其實說這話的人，根本就不至於餓死，樂得說說風凉話。倘使餓死事小，吃飯算不得一個大問題，那麽，誰還肯做强盗，把性命去拚飯吃呢？</p>
<p>老實說，性命是任何人都要的，要維持性命，除了老天無代價供給的空氣之外，就是吃飯。做漢奸，做奸商，做强盜，做貪官污吏，一切的所謂罪大惡極的事情，其背景，無非是爲了要吃飯，或是取得吃飯的代價，以維持性命。資本主義者，其目的是要解决吃飯問題。共產主義者，其目的也無非是要解决吃飯問題。任何一切杜製的，或是舶來的主義，無一不是要謀吃飯問題的解决，所以我說，［吃飯主義］，是不拘誰何，都應當信仰而崇拜的。倘使有一個人自己不承認［吃飯主義］的信徒，那一定是一個有辟　術的人妖。</p>
<p>善策。</p>
<p>在患難當頭時，不從對待敵人一方面謀出路，决沒有倖存的道理！朋友，我們要集中力量，團結我們自己，挺着胸膊，奮着雙腕，大家向前，從絶境中開闢出一條生路來！我們雖不必滅盡匈奴，却不可不逐走匈！</p>

<p>— 胡梯維</p>
<p>這些印象，都使紅葉内心的不寗，比方才接到哥哥來信的時候，又增加數倍。呑白煤，吐黑烟的怪物，雖然車不停輪的完成它［特别快］的使命，紅葉終還不知足，恨不得一步跨到Ｃ鄉，一看父親瘦削的兩頰，白髮盈顚的額角。可是事實不能如願，汽笛一聲，他終於隨着一班嘻嘻哈哈的紅男綠女，消滅在車站附近一所小旅館裏。</p>
<p>頭剛落枕，就有一隊上海人所謂［富貴蟲］者，排隊相迎，不得不掙起了昏花眼，出全力以與周旋。據說。富貴蟲是上海都會的特產。Ｃ鄉就很難得發見。這裏大約幸虧有火車與富貴地相溝通，所以也蒙賞光駐蹕。勦了一陣，覺得實在抵抗不了，還是漂亮些，聽憑侵略。忽然床前人影一閃，紅葉跳了起來！</p>
<p>［先生，要呌個人玩玩？］</p>
<p>［滾蛋！替我鎖上們！］</p>
<p>［這種東西，罪浮於富貴蟲，也在可殺之列，］紅葉越想越氣，起來挿上了門拴。</p>
<p>第二次的醒來，也不知是幾點鐘了？房外砰砰，敲的一片響！</p>
<p>［什麽人？什麽事］</p>
<p>］先生，開開門。查房間來了。［</p>
<p>紅葉開門，方才那個茶房領着四個威風凛凛的警察。當先一個揑着本循環簿；</p>
<p>［你姓什麽？呌什麽？那裏來？那裏去？］</p>
<p>他問了四句，便一揮手去了。紅葉望望枕邊的錶，足足兩點一刻。這氣越發大了。這算是保護治安呢？擾亂行旅呢？霎時一轉念，他又明白了。啊！也許是我不捨得花錢呌人的一個小小報應。</p>
<p>在這短旅行的過程中。造物旣不肯賜他一個甜蜜的夢，他也不再留戀。曉色朦朧中，他又在黃色車上繼續他的征程Ｃ渡過了沙帆殘月的Ｃ江，急急地鑽上頭班的長途汽車。他記得在報上常常年見Ｃ鄉長途汽車，肇禍傷人的新聞。不是汽車翻落稻田裏，便呈跳河忽浴。據傳這條省道的駕駛員，都沾染三分官氣。駕駛而稱員，當然與上海人口中的汽車夫有别。第一，是他們不要［克門沙］，客人給他，他非但不收，而且拂然認爲是一種惡意的侮辱！這是指個人單僱的包車，要化到八元八角（二）</p>

<p>［汽車的形狀與烏龜的樣，足類似的］這句話，爲有名　設計專門家美國人呌做威廉斯多德所提倡的。因爲烏龜的形狀，是一個［抛　　，］一　　體可以减少空氣的抵抗力。烏龜不論前而有怎麽樣大的風，　　　　　快，汽車在地上行駛，　要减少對面空氣的抵抗力　所以做照烏龜的形狀製造吧。</p>

<p>那末，烏龜可以說是自動車的模型。俗語說：烏龜與兎競走，兎還沒有赶　上烏龜。這就是沒有空氣抵抗力的道理。近　科學家根據這原理，製造　彈，也模倣烏龜的形狀。就是爲了放射時，可以減少空氣的抵抗力，能够射得很遠，你看看上面的圖，自然明白了。</p>

<p>如果說［九一八］的瀋陽事變好像晴天一霹靂，那麽［一二八］的上海血戰光景就是暴風雨罷？現在離［一二八］又是一週年了，全中國固然是密雲未雨前的黑暗沉悶，全世界也是加緊武裝，待機爆發。戰</p>
<p>神在獰笑！</p>
<p>我們回想上海血戰的當時，大火燒燬了繁盛的閘北，砲彈掃平了江灣吳淞大塲，租界内傷兵難民滿坑滿谷，資產者憂慮著公債庫劵變成廢紙，憂慮著閘北地皮永遠跌價，内地的小商人爲了上海［錢莊不通］而愁眉蹙額，沿鐵路線的農民忍痛看著自己的田地被圈作飛機塲，被挖掘了戰壕，大人先生忙著布置陪都，陸都，行都，恨不得一步跨上了喜馬拉雅山的最高峯：丨丨我們現在一閉眼就喚回了去年此時可歌可泣可嘆的時代交響曲！</p>
<p>但是一週年以後的上海怎樣呢？救濟東北難民游藝會在［花選］的歡呼中閉幕了，復興閘北災區的奬劵正以頭彩三十九萬圓大事號召，天堂的租界裏新開了幾家影戲館，大减價的百貨商店顧客潮擁，梅博士來上海奏藝，許多人買不到票，新妝的短大衣，新妝的更長的旂袍：繁華的上海依然那樣繁華，！！不，更加繁華！如果不是愛多嘴的新聞紙頻傳熱河告急，山海關頭砲響，誰又肯信我們的國難仍是未已，我不犯人，人却犯我，而所謂［長期抵抗］事實上乃是長期］不］抵抗！</p>
<p>上海實在是太平世界了，却是蒙在鼓心裏的上海小市民還沒忘記去年此日的敎訓，看見虹口的日本海軍陸戰隊要舉行［檢閱式］，於是又恐慌，又紛紛搬家。可敬而又可憐的小市民呀！你們不要慌！難道你們沒聽說英法對日有密約，日本不再來騷擾上海，那交換條件就是英法默認日本在熱河榆關的軍事行動？有錢人比你們聰明得多了，他們知道上海是太平世界。</p>
<p>不見他們朝朝暮暮酣歌醉舞麽？</p>

<p>［北上，自然可能的，他近來不是正鬧着失戀嗎？不過，投軍與否，那我當然不能說定了］。磊冷冷地說着，忽然像發現了什麽似的，他向着桐：［你不是要到東北去嗎？正好。你可以和老姜一同去！］</p>
<p>［去，我給顏色你們看，我自會到東北去！···喔，悶熱。悶熱，討厭，我的頭有些昏！］桐說着，立起身來，走去開陽台的玻璃門，跨了出去，可是立刻縮進來了，他打了一個寒噤。坐到桌邊，喝完杯中的酒，他遲疑地問，［再添酒？］</p>
<p>［我想，不必了。吩咐拿飯來吧］。坊倚着椅背。胡琴的　呀聲繼續傳過來。下面，吧吧地接馳過幾部汽車。</p>
<p>不一會，壁上搖　着幾個踉蹌的影子，三個人飯罷回去。</p>
<p>告别時磊用着得意的作弄的聲調，向桐叮囑道：</p>
<p>［老酮，明晚假使你不曾到東北去的話，那末我們在辣斐舞廳再見吧！］（完）</p>

<p>— 慧儀</p>
<p>認識在一個宴會上。開始談話在一個公園裏。並肩而坐在幾個電影院裏。合奏所謂［春之小曲］在幾個緋色信封中。接吻，擁抱，在幾個秘密所在。</p>
<p>於是，戀愛了。小玲，十七歲的小玲，戀愛了。</p>
<p>睡覺懂得把眼睛合攏，吃的東西到嘴裏知道嚼爛咽下喉去，這麽聰明了的小玲，當然，可以戀愛了。會塗唇膏，能抹得粉，穿起三寸高的高跟鞋還能在上臘的地板上跳趣狐步舞，喝了一盃葡萄酒還能嬌聲婉囀地唱一支西洋愛情小曲；如此這般［能幹了］的小玲，［戀愛］己從天上，許是從所謂桃色的雲裏掉下來，站在她眠床前做俏眉眼了，小玲爲什麽不急急抓來，放在忱畔，給自己的夢璄裏增加一個富有刺激性的表演節目呢！小珍戀愛了；小玲，戀愛吧！</p>
<p>［是的，我戀愛了！幹錯了什麽嗎？］</p>
<p>戀愛，那裏會幹錯了什麽。小姐們　　　的是［享樂］，［戀愛］也是小姐們的［享樂品］；十七歲的，需要享樂的小姐，戀愛了，幹錯了什麽？正是從何說起！</p>
<p>［小玲，戀愛吧！］那時，我興奮，雖然終於沒有道出所謂祝詞來，可是我　至誠的心（假如我有一顆對待朋友的至誠的心的話，）的確對她祝着所謂［戀愛成功的］！</p>
<p>××××××</p>
<p>結婚禮廳已經佈置得非常炫人雙目了。</p>
<p>新娘已經妝扮得的確像個漂亮的新娘了。有什麽驚奇可以存在人們的心頭呢？收到了請柬的人們，當然，祗有高興地去參觀婚禮，和喝喜酒。</p>
<p>［恭喜！恭喜！］我與小玲是有着所謂［孩子與老人］的友誼的，在過份的高興的情緒之下，我學着喜娘的口吻，一鞠躬再加個拱手道了個雙料喜！］</p>
<p>［····祝一對新夫婦···］證婚人的祝詞</p>
<p>［····明年今日，貪嘴的我們來賓，再吃紅蛋吧！］來賓代表的祝詞終究不像證婚人那末［像煞有介事］而有趣多了。</p>
<p>偏要我所謂祝詞兼演說的說幾句，於是：</p>
<p>［···戀愛成功！祝戀愛成功！沒有幹錯了什麽···］那時，我實在說不出什麽來，這樣子旣祝又演的說出三四句，［敬謝不敏！］說着，逃下台來，</p>
<p>閙新房，來賓嬲住了新夫婦自述［戀愛經過···閙一陣，笑一陣。</p>
<p>［隨便述一下吧！］新郎自述完後，對新娘說了。</p>
<p>［···那末，我···隨便的從認識到戀愛，從戀愛到結婚吧！····］</p>
<p>［什麽，小玲！］我驚奇的呌了出來，［從認識到戀愛，到結婚，是那樣子［？［噢！我說錯啦！我的意思是隨便的從認識說到戀愛，再說到結婚···戀愛，結婚···那裏會，那裏可以［隨便］呢！］</p>
<p>［對了，對了！呵呵···哈哈］，那時，我粗聲地笑了。</p>
<p>××××××××</p>
<p>但，昨日小玲到囗律師處幹妥了委任代理與她丈夫離異的交涉之後，在途中，我又碰到了她。她說：［我幹錯了的，當時的戀愛··結婚，···隨便透了！］</p>
<p>小玲　，還是十七歲的小玲但她除了懂事當時所懂得的一切之外，如今，又懂得［隨離婚］了。</p>
<p>［小玲！再戀愛，再結婚吧！隨便也好！這會使你的十八歲更聰明的！］</p>

<p>古代的藝術作品是人人所愛好欣賞的，但是爲了某種的動機，出常常有人背叛良知，作成許多僞品，企圖達到他們的目的。</p>
<p>好些科學家看到了這種現象，都深切的感得古代藝術品眞僞的研究是急迫地需要的。於是大家都來研究，最近已得到了圓滿的結果。發明者是英國皇家藝術學會會員Ａ·Ｐ·Ｌ·ａｕｒｉｅ先生，這種儀器是利用紫外光線，牠的外形好像平常用的照相機，携帶是非常的便利。不論什麽字或畫，經牠察騐以後，卽能看出字畫本身的技巧和顏色，那些都不是平常肉眼所能見到的。英國已應用這種儀器了，至於别國尙沒有。講到中國，關於紫外光線的研究尙沒有一個人，自然更是談不到了。</p>

<p>她看見他那樣和好疎遠，有點不樂意。但是海泉仍然蹴着地上的枯葉向前進。走過了一座矮崗，便是一所灌木林，海泉一面走，便一面想起南國的鄉間風景來了。</p>

<p>［你太不近人情了］！</p>
<p>她𢭵着嘴唇，怨慰着說。</p>
<p>迎面有一羣男女青年走來，個個都以驚異的視線眺望他們。看得他又趕快離開她。</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>說起來自覺好笑，前次旣談賣國，現在又說救國，國旣可［賣］［救］云乎哉？然而仔細思量，也不是全無理由，因爲有許多人以賣國而遺臭萬年，亦有許多人因救國而流芳千古，正如旣有秦檜，出就得有一個岳飛，而岳飛正因秦檜而顯其［思］也。</p>
<p>前例頗多，何必枚舉？是以，我之立立論，並非全無根據者也。</p>
<p>然則，此國也，將何以救？曰：救國之道正多，只看你如何擇而行之耳。　　大而言之，［宣言］［通電］可以救國，［經懺［法會］可以救國，［抗議］［覺書］可以救國，［不抵抗］可以救國，［抵抗］而曰［長期］更可以救國，而且［論語］［中庸］也可以救國，小而言之［國術救國］［藝術救國［募捐］旣可救國，［］吸烟［也可救國，［跳舞］可以救國，［游藝］更可以救國，推而廣之，吃飯可以救國，穿衣可以救國，睡覺，拉屎，無一不可救國，然而吃飯須改吃［外麥］麵包，穿衣須穿［眞正國貨］，睡覺必須［枕戈］而［臥薪］，而拉屎自非抽水馬桶不可，否則便有失救國之意義而不收救國之功效也。</p>
<p>懿歟盛哉，浩浩盪盪，救國之道，何其多也？丨</p>
<p>或曰：［此等救國之道，我國行之久矣，緣何中國還未得救？］曰：此公差矣，中國究竟未亡，苟非努力救之，那能如此，而此等大道之功績，豈淺鮮哉丨而且僅失東北三省，何可去亡？國旣未亡，又何須救？</p>
<p>或曰，［救國當救於未亡之日］，是以話又說回來了，中國須救，殆無疑義，何况全國熙熙攘攘，大家都談救國，以我之［愛國不敢後人］，救國又豈甘居後？是以當諸公茶餘飯後之時　談談救國，亦無不可，可是眞正［有效］的實行起來，到也大可不必，因爲此時中國賣國之人正是多着，你又何必定要效法岳飛而出力呢？</p>
<p>不過眞正能夠救亡的，還只有那許多蒲爾曼吧？因爲只有他們才會感受亡國的痛苦。</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3 id="c249">用自來水筆常識 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 顧履霜</p>
<p>在商界學界政界的人，差不我人人備一支自來水筆。實在因牠便利，又加美觀，所以雖價値很蹟，大衆都願意買一支。筆是買了，可是不知怎樣去保護，買來好好的筆，用不多時，便有種種壞處，在有錢的再去買一支，但經濟稍不寬餘只有用着那支壞筆，怪着筆的不好，不知是自己弄壞的呢，因將用自來水筆的常識，記之以告讀者。</p>
<p>市上墨水的牌子很多，牠們的成份各異，所以某支筆用何種墨，不能更換。否則因二種墨水的化學作用，有損筆頭用皮管。如必須掉換，則宜將宿墨水洗盡，再裝新者。</p>
<p>墨水宜用上等，劣者易有沉澱物拆出，致將筆管杜塞。墨水瓶宜常蓋緊，否則即使上等墨水，亦有沉澱物拆出，此用者不可不知，國貨墨水中，大華牌及標準牌均堪應用，比之華德門及卡約不相下下。</p>
<p>若用筆時墨水聚於筆頭，或墨水時時點下，此乃橡及管内墨水已完之證，因此管内滿充空氣，致壓力增大，墨水壓下。若裝滿墨水，即可免此弊，不必驚慌。</p>
<p>墨水不能下時，可用冷水洗筆，法同灌墨水。洗筆頭須用冷水，熱水有損筆桿產色，且使橡皮管易破裂。</p>
<p>墨水筆在筆套内拔出時，若筆桿上滿沾墨水，則須將筆套上之二小孔用針通之。此乃小孔被塞，空氣不流通，筆外壓力小，墨水即可流出。</p>
<p>上述種種，均爲用筆者所應知常識，照此行之，一支筆至少好多用幾年。</p>

<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>下了幾天的雪，現在經了陽光的融化，這里打成了一片泥濘不堪的道路，行起路來靴子幾乎完全浸入泥去：假使稍不留意，也會把你一個筋斗送轉回去。本來，這里少有人注意它，也許是離去都市遙遠的緣故吧。</p>
<p>黃昏，阿根照例的由工廠回家，放下了小籃子，就奔向茅屋後田園裏去，帮同媽媽種菜澆水，替媽媽挑擔了。：：可是現在却失了常態，再不能怎樣從從容容的過他的日常安閒生活：門是緊閉着，從那稻草縫裏可以依稀聴得一陣陣唏噓的哭聲，於是他駭得夠慌了！</p>
<p>第二天東方剛吐露出魚白的曙光，阿根懶洋洋地起了身，心裏默然想道：［媽媽凍得害病，無人看護，那有勇氣去上工呢？唉！爲子的該應在她身邊盡些［晨昏定省］的天職了。］於是他感覺到沒有人照料的悲哀，也就聯想起爸爸生時的一種愉快！刹那間，工廠的氣笛繼續在鳴，鳴，這是最後一聲的忠告，爲了麵包問題的追迫，不得不悻悻地去了。</p>
<p>茅屋裏的氣壓十分靜寂，除了阿根的媽媽心靈微跳躍之聲外，其餘簡直找不到東西可以來形容。</p>
<p>［開門···開···開。］外面特然有人打着竹籬門在嘶喊。</p>
<p>［看你的男人講話］。一個着的黑制服的警察一眼釘住阿根的媽媽問道。</p>
<p>［老爺，我的丈夫早死了，只有個十四歲的兒子，餘者一個親人兒者沒有了。］</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>[呌他兒子來，不要同她嚕嚕囌囌］。另外一個警察說。</p>
<p>［請問老爺，幹，幹，幹什麽事？我所兒子在工廠裏呵！有事同我商量］　　［唔？限你們在今天完全把家搬走，附近的茅屋統統拆除。］</p>
<p>［爲的，爲的···］她急着問，聲音帶有顫抖，但是話語還沒有完，她耳躱裏又刺這樣兩聲：</p>
<p>［有什麽？把茅屋拆掉！］那是一個雄糾糾氣昂昂的警察喊道。</p>
<p>［大老爺，饒恕吧，如何能搬動呢？我還有病。］</p>
<p>［嘿哈，有病？眞笑話。］</p>
<p>［病，有痛。她說：［我們是勞苦平民，自從滬戰發作後，大家避難於此，幾乎費了一年的辛苦，才經營得蓋這茅屋：要是替我們拆了，呌我們往何處去呢，并且，假如我們的房屋不在閘北被燬的話，那末我們倒霉又何至於此呢？］</p>
<p>［話多？馬特皮，搬···搬···搬］。同時她的兩頰便印上了很清脆的一季耳光。　　［唉！我們不是小偷，不是綁票，爲什麽迫得我們無路爲生？反正，我這條老命奉送給你們罷了···］她禁不住眼眶中流出幾行苦涙，拍的暈倒在污泥上。</p>
<p>［起來，老太婆！這是××局的命令，實在不得通融辦理的，趁早吧，否則我們也得動手］。有個比較和善的警察這樣勸導。</p>
<p>［老爺，局裏有啥理由，要我們把茅屋拆燬，并且立刻搬走？］</p>
<p>［不錯，因爲茅屋草栅［有礙都市的觀瞻］囉！］</p>
<p>［啞？老太婆怪不介意似的，委實是個瘋子，帶往局裏去。］那個雄糾糾氣昂昂的警察插進來道。</p>
<p>暮色籠罩着大地，阿根應着氣笛之氣，滿腹懷着希望似的跑了回家，呆若木雞的眼簾下只是一堆堆稻草和竹籬，極慘淡的在地上散亂着，再出找不到他慈愛的高堂，聊以禦寒的茅屋了！</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>余生性頑鈍，遇事寡斷。今因繼承問題，狐疑不决；特將詳細情形，直陳於后：尙希明白指示，不勝盼禱之至。</p>
<p>余家境清貧，有三伯父年逾花甲，歷年作客他鄉，積資頗豐。但膝下猶　，早歲曾有撫我爲子之議，但事未果行。民國十八年，乃立大伯父次子爲後。不料彼不知自愛，終日尋花問柳。經三伯父一再訓誡；但言者諄諄，聽者藐藐。三伯父的心，因此變遷，終於去年八月，雙方决裂，三伯父竟將伊逐出了。十二月中，三伯父來滬見訪，意欲重申前議，立我乃後。余對此當然樂從；但恐被逐的族兄。心有不甘，將來勢必纒訟不休，因此疑不能决。（下略）嚴享文謹上。</p>
<p>者按：民法繼承篇第一千一百四十三條規定［無直系血親卑親屬者，得以遺囑，就其財產之全部或一部，指定繼承人；但以不違反關於特留部份之規定時爲限］。所以嚴君的三伯父，當然可以很自由的指定任何人，爲其財產的繼承人。但因有撫養嚴君的族兄的一叚事實在前，爲了避免後患起見，手續不得不求其完備，爲今之計，嚴君的三伯父，應趕速爲退繼（指與嚴君的族兄）與立繼（指與嚴君）的登記；這種登記，可向原籍的自治機關爲之。倘使這種人事登記的制度，在嚴君的原籍，還沒有施行的話，那末也可以申請法院，或兼理司法的縣政府備案。同時應將遺囑立好：據我們的意見，這遺囑應採用［公證遺囑］，方爲妥當。</p>
<p>上面不過是就法律的立塲，來解决這問題的辦法。我們以爲享［蔭下之福］，是一個頂天立地的男子漢，應當認爲可恥的。嚴君的三伯父，假使定要嚴君爲其繼承人的話；爲了要使他老人家得到安慰起見，當然不能拒絶。但是决不要認爲這是發横財的機會呀！嚴君應當設法導其族兄於正。回頭是岸，去邪歸正，在受了極大刺激（被逐）之後，是極容易的。那時嚴君更當在他三伯父前，善爲關說，恢復他們的關係。三伯父的財產，不妨各半承受。旣不致使老年人失望於現在，又何全弟兄的感情，而自已也不致失去相當利益；這是最妥當，最高尙的辦法。</p>
<p>末了，因爲嚴君的族兄，能否决心向善，尙在未知之數的緣故：我們以爲法律手續，仍須及早辦妥。俾得權操自我，這是計策萬全的意思呀！</p>

<p>仲南一向在政界裏混事，曾做過幾任關監督，後來又升任了財政廳長，在任幾年，就掙了一份好家私回來。老大伯東，守着祖遺的產業，名雖在家務農，其實足跡從未到過田裏，祇是坐在家裏靠收租米吃飯罷了。老三叔西早故。老四季北，是一個書獃子。老五幼中，在法政學堂裏讀書，是一位預備律師。　　仲南年逾四十，還沒有兒子，他得了太太的同意，便在粤南任上抱了一個六歲的孩子回來做螟蛉，這就是後來被驅逐的那個茂生。同時仲南又娶了一個名妓做姨太太。</p>

<p>也是闊客，現在迎她回家，朋友們都說他們是［老店新開］。</p>
<p>仲南的夫人平常約束極嚴，不許丈夫到外面去嫖妓宿娼，所以仲南只能偷偷摸摸的去赴幽會，在太太面前不敢走漏一點風聲。有人笑他有季常癖，他却絶對否認。他說：</p>

<p>他的聲明，有人以爲他［紮面子］的飾詞，他便舉一件事實出來證明道：　　［在五年以前，我眞不拿她放在眼裏咧，那時我在外面已築着一所金屋，只緣［免淘氣］而並未通知她，後來，我那愛人忽然懷孕，十月滿足，產下一個雪白滾胖的大頭兒子。我與她都因中年乏嗣，盼養兒子的心極切；尤其是她，常常到廟裏去求神許願，並用重價偷偷的去搜求種了良藥丹方，玩了許多把戲，結果還是連一個響屁出放不出！現在我的外室養了兒子，雖非太太親生。究竟是夏門的骨肉，她聽見也一定歡喜的。當時我就冒冒失失的回去告訴她得知，並要求她把兒子和兒子的母親一齊接回家來同居。誰知她聽了這個消息，頓時臉色灰白，眼珠向上一翻，［𠮾］的一聲，就死過去了！隔了好幾個鐘頭，才慢慢地把她的幽魂喊回來。從此以後，不能再提此事，向她一提，就會死過去半天，眞同催命符一樣，所以我的怕老婆，不是怕她脾氣太凶，實在是怕她的身體太嬌嫩，太會斷氣呵！］</p>
<p>［兒女情長，英雄氣短］，凡禁不起婦女們擺弄的男子，都拿這句成語來做遁詞。仲南因怕太太斷氣而屈服在裙帶之下　有人便將這成語修正後贈給他們夫妻［老爺情長，太太氣短。］</p>

<h3 id="c256">好萊塢的經濟危機 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 福倫</p>
<p>本刋及其他電影刋物裏，提到好萊塢的富庶奢移，似乎都欣欣樂道的，所以給與讀者的一斑印像，就是滿地鋪金，白玉砌墻，銀灰色的律摩心毫無聲息地飄來飄去，裏面坐的是神仙眷屬。其實，現在却已不似從前了。所以爲解除讀者過分的崇仰心，實有介紹這篇文字的必要。</p>
<p>好萊塢新聞記者寗娜普南女士說，好萊塢的内容，有不可究詰的　衷，但是外表仍舊硬裝塲面，不肯坍臺。法國的大影評家某亦於日前發出驚人的預言，說好萊塢於六個月之内，仍發生經濟及藝術的大崩潰，可以使全世界震驚。我們雖不能一定相信好萊塢在最近半年内，將一蹶不振，但至少可以對於這種預示，說一聲[不爲無因]吧。</p>
<p>寗娜女士曾訪問過一位好萊塢的大明星。他仍舊住在皮佛山上最富麗一所房子裏。好進去的時候，正値主人們進膳。她看見檯上羅列的食品，似乎不大豐富，但是她還是不大在意。她後來看見屋子内沒有電燈，點的係蠟燭，她慢慢有些異起來了。但是主人說他的太不喜歡幽靜，所以不開電燈的。後來她乘主人一個冷不防　溜到别間屋裏，開開電門，亦沒有電。她恍然大悟了，並且起了一種悚然的恐懼。呀，世界的不景氣，居然侵入了這金吾不夜歌舞未央的影城了！她又一個　入地蔭子（地下層，裏面專爲煤爐，片鍋，烹飪之所），劃了一根洋火，發見煤氣灶上煤氣亦沒有了。給她發現的事情很多，這位大明星的住宅裏，非但電燈煤氣都已割斷，連電話亦不通了。</p>
<p>但是他仍舊不能不照樣的住在這所大房子裏，硬挺頭皮，仍舊要坐富麗的大汽車；遇見人家問［您好？］的時候，仍舊要硬撑塲面地說［很好，謝謝您。因爲他倘使不如此，他馬上就要被人家看不起，就要站不住脚，祇好捲舗蓋滾蛋。</p>
<p>受同樣影響的當然不止他一個。許多銀行關門了，各種投資失敗了，明星們昔日冰山有靠的，現在已經一貧如洗，從前他們可以和廠主導演閙脾氣，一來就慣紗帽不幹，現在祇好低心下氣地尋些隨便甚麽事做做，有許多本年沒事可做，却不肯承認失業，而要每天坐了汽車，停在大公司的門口，或向攝影塲裏去轉一轉身。嗐，這多苦，而可憐呀！</p>

<p>美國加州近來新造一個大戲院，是二個戲院合成的，戲台在中間，當開映的時候，二邊都可以入座觀看，這樣一來，可以使坐位寬舒些，不至過於擁擠，以一個戲台而兼施二個戲院的職務，也可以算别開生面，發明者是一個美國工程師，計畫了許久，到現在才實現。</p>
<p>德國有一個工科大學的敎授，發明一種光學器械，在戲院中影戲開映的時候，可以隨手在這架機器的玻瑙片上冩字，一面寫一面就在銀幕上放映出來，對於報告臨時消息，時事緊要新聞和名人留筆等，都有種種便利。這位敎授發明之初，是利有做一個大課堂上敎授數學中極繁重的方式，的很來才用到戲院裏去，現在已有不少戲院採用了。</p>

<p>明星公司的製片廠雖沒有聯華那麽多，但在去年的出品總數，似乎不出聯華之下。不過他們對於在拍攝每一部影片之前，並不限定此片最多用多少尺的底片；如［啼笑姻緣；］［自由之花；］····等片，這都是化去三萬餘尺的底片才得到一萬尺左右的影片：而一部七八千尺的影片，用掉兩萬多尺的底片，更是占着他們出品中的多數。所以他們每年所用的底片總數，總是超乎任何那個公司之外。他們覺得長此以往，殊不是善策，很想卽刻實行節省；可是他們爲欲使出品美滿，終於不敢遽然實行。這也使他們萬分的艱難。</p>
<p>最近鄭正秋因爲這個問題曾和公司中重要職員如周劍雲等一度討論改善辦法；當時議决縮短影片尺數，並增攝［卡通畫。］名畫家萬籟鳴·萬古蟾兩君之人明星，就是被聘爲擔任［卡通畫］主任。</p>
<p>［神秘的小偵探，］就是現在剛開拍的［卡通畫，］演員有譯志遠·張敏等；片長一千尺。因爲此後明星的出品，較嚋昔的爲短，故這種［卡通畫，］是預備將來隨着正片開映的。</p>

<p>在目下中國電影界，對於童星的缺乏，和需求之迫切，是誰也不能否認的事實。因此，這孕育·在天一公司裏的女童星之羣，實在是値得我們注意的啊！這裏，記者特把這一羣女童星介紹出來：</p>
<p>袁美雲：她在未從事電影工作之前，是一個著名的舞台小女伶，她有嬌小玲瓏的身叚，活潑伶俐的姿態，更富有表演的天才，她在目下的中國電影界裏面，可以算是天字第一號的女童星哩！</p>
<p>邵素霞：好是天一的協理邵邨人的女公子，今年十四歲，在市立比德小學讀書，天眞爛漫，會唱歌·會彈琴：好像一隻活潑的小鳥。她在默片時代，已做過不少部影片的要角·有聲片［游藝大會］及［戰地］［孤女］她也參加在人。在新片［孼海雙鴛］中，她飾一個被窮人撫養的富翁的女兒，表演得很好。</p>
<p>陳綺霞：！是天一公司老板娘陳玉梅的妹妹，活潑天眞，在［游藝大會］中的載歌載舞，留下非常好的成績，給人一個好印象。預料將來必有更驚人的成績，貢獻出來。</p>
<p>陳競芳：她的年紀雖小，却已長成的像一朶芙蓉般的鮮艶了。她在［蘭谷萍踪］中飾一個婢女，獲得佳譽，更有人說她的成功，不下於陳燕燕的［一剪梅］哩。我們期望她今後更加努力，成爲一顆名童星。</p>

<p>中歐羅巴十九世紀的風情，中歐羅已十九世紀的文化。</p>
<p>維也納，這德奥民族的故都北平，由藍色的多腦河環流着，在十九世紀初葉，古堡森嚴，圓舞曲的旋律輕浮於細草之上。他是中歐最古之城，神聖羅馬帝國的帝都，天才音樂家的搖籃地，而爲羅曼情趣的集中點，我們在名畫中所見到的古典派美人，長裙拂地，臉上點一顆很大的黑痣，以及那些寳刀駿馬的武士，卽所謂日爾曼藍十字騎士，豪俠之風，結晶而成這中古羅曼的文化，而由貝多芬許貝德等用天堂的音響幻化其氛圍，降至近代，其在歐洲藝術上地位，仍佔最優秀地位丨丨［晚安，維也納，］便是以這［夢幻之都］爲背境的一張音樂喜劇，所謂［晚安，維也納］者，便是一位近代騎士，對這［夢幻之都］徬於征途上所發出的戀别呼聲，其凄艶之情緒，實與拜倫告别英國時的［晚安，我的故響］異曲同工。全片的結構趣味豐饒，極温馨美麗之至，可稱爲西洋音樂藝術精髓的副產物。其對於人生的態度，是反對嚴肅化的活潑小諷刺，但仍不脫中古騎士少女的羅曼作風，如男主角必須爲軍官，女主角必須先爲賣花女，後爲著名女伶是。</p>
<p>總之，影片就是烘托給我們以維也納的夢之美麗，及其美麗的人物，這純是文藝的副產物，是反對把人生變成嚴肅認眞化的調劑品，很有點巴黎風的幽默態度，若以時髦政治眼光視之，則維也納旣爲歐洲封建勢力的發源地，劇中人物又無不極端地小資產階級劣根化，絲毫也不革命、自然祇是［流毒的麻醉品］。</p>

<p>德國烏發影片公司在世界影壇上是站着超然的地位。它的出品，不管是甚麽一種題材，都是聚精會神，全力奔赴，絲毫地不肯苟且。我們從它那［斬龍遇仙記］一直數到現在在南京大戲院開映的［龍翔鳳舞］，有那一張不是在適合於電影藝術的條件上而給予觀者以美妙良好的印象？</p>
<p>據說［霓裳仙子，］是烏發公司去年出品上乘與［龍翔鳳舞］並駕齊驅。在歐州各都會，同亨盛名。［龍翔鳳舞］是音樂歌劇化，［霓裳仙子］也是音樂歌劇化，不過題材不同，導演的手段不同。除此之外［霓裳仙子］的劇材幽默化，是一種人生的小諷刺。</p>
<p>全劇的描寫非常輕飄，冷雋，有巴黎風。拿一個小國度來尋開心，甚爲幽默。然而它寫的是一段夢幻般的人生，快樂甜蜜，屈服於戀愛至上主義之下成了青年男女們的憧憬。</p>
<p>它的題旨是以小來喻大的，對於君主政體有絶對的懷疑，它挖苦官僚政客武人，它搶白豪商鉅賈，它譏誚屬僚部員，它却同情於生命之火的燃燒，青春的活躍。</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen Nations, in view of the failure of mediation procedures, decided to draft a report in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. This matter was decided after the committee discussed it for two and a half hours yesterday. The united front of the Committee of Nineteen Nations will be maintained to the end, and it is unwilling to change the resolution adopted on December 15 of last year. Chairman Hymans reviewed the recent proposals of China and Japan and felt that Japan only recognized what was beneficial to it in the methods proposed by the Committee of Nineteen Nations on Wednesday, i.e., not allowing non-member states to participate. In addition, Japan has various demands that are contrary to the spirit and wording of the December 15 resolution, the most important of which is the demand to delete all words related to "Manchukuo" in the preamble and the resolution itself. Also, if the current procedures succeed, the tasks of the mediation committee are to be limited. This is the position of Japan. As for the demands put forward by the Chinese delegation, namely, not recognizing "Manchukuo" and inviting the United States and Russia to participate in the discussions, the positions of the two sides are so different that the Committee of Nineteen Nations cannot but recognize the failure of its efforts. In the future, there will be only one method: drafting recommendations without the participation of the two parties involved. However, only the Special General Assembly of the League of Nations has the power to formally certify the failure of the mediation procedures. The above remarks by the Committee of Nineteen Nations do not represent a decision on behalf of the General Assembly. The Committee of Nineteen Nations is scheduled to meet on Monday to draft the first report, so as to report the negative results of its efforts to the Extraordinary General Assembly. It is generally expected that the Extraordinary General Assembly will be convened in early February to make a final decision on the proposals of the Committee of Nineteen Nations. When the Extraordinary General Assembly convenes for the second time, it will, in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant, review the recommendations drafted by the Committee of Nineteen Nations. This is the committee's second report. (Havas dispatch from Geneva, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Nineteenth Special Committee met at 4:00 PM on the 21st for two hours and fifteen minutes, deciding that mediation procedures had almost failed and discussing procedures for drafting a report on the dispute as outlined in Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. Finally, it was agreed to adjourn until Monday morning to continue the discussion, and at the same time, three draft proposals of this report will be sent to the members of the Nineteenth Special Committee. The content is currently kept secret. The Special Committee has not yet abandoned the possibility of mediation. If any of the two parties puts forward a new proposal that can form the basis for a resolution, the Special Committee will welcome it.</p>

<p>Today, the Special Committee studied the Japanese proposal and unanimously decided that several points were absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, it unanimously decided to proceed to the second stage. Secretary-General Drummond attended to explain the so-called Drummond plan. The Special Committee found Drummond's explanation satisfactory and decided to bring the matter to a close. The Special Committee felt that the opinions of China and Japan were too far apart, and mediation seemed unlikely.</p>

<p>The Swiss representative, Mr. Huber, declared that only the League of Nations General Assembly can decide whether mediation has failed. Therefore, the Special Committee decided to leave room for mediation before the League of Nations General Assembly convenes, while proceeding with the drafting of the report. It is expected that the League of Nations General Assembly will convene on February 1st or 2nd. One member raised the question of whether the drafting of the report should be discussed with the League of Nations General Assembly, but the members believed that, according to the duties of the Special Committee as stipulated in the resolution of March 11, 1932, the Special Committee could proceed with the drafting of the report. The Special Committee continued to discuss methods for a considerable amount of time and decided to continue the discussion at 10:00 AM on Monday morning. The content of the report has not yet been discussed, and it may not be discussed even on Monday. The Executive Yuan originally scheduled a meeting for next Monday, but because the Special Committee is meeting that day, the Executive Yuan meeting has been postponed to Tuesday.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Public Communiqué Issued at the Meeting, Welcoming New Proposals from Both Sides <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The communiqué issued after today's meeting is as follows: At the afternoon meeting today, the Special Committee learned from the declaration made by the Japanese representative to the chairman and secretary-general that the Japanese government is not prepared to accept the draft resolution of December 15, even if the section inviting non-member states to participate in the negotiations is deleted. After issuing this declaration, the Japanese delegation informed the chairman that the proposal automatically submitted to the Special Committee by the Japanese representative yesterday had been approved by the Japanese government. After studying the new proposals of the Japanese government and the Chinese amendments to the original text of the draft resolution, the Special Committee has notified both parties that it can only declare that it cannot put forward a proposal acceptable to both parties. If the Special Committee must also modify other conditions of the December 15 draft resolution according to the Japanese proposal, the importance that the Chinese delegation and the Special Committee itself attach to the participation of the United States and Russia in the settlement negotiations will definitely make it impossible to delete this section merely at the request of the Japanese side. The Special Committee also felt that even if it was agreed to change the explanatory memorandum into a declaration by the chairman of the Special Committee, so that both parties could freely make reservations, the Japanese government would still have to wait for the original text of the December 15 draft resolution to be modified before it could accept it. The Japanese government has requested important modifications to the original text of the Special Committee's draft resolution in its recent proposal, which the Special Committee considers unacceptable. Under these circumstances, the Special Committee feels that the effort to propose reconciliation of the dispute to the League of Nations General Assembly has, as far as the Special Committee is concerned, temporarily failed. The Special Committee has to assume that the League of Nations General Assembly will have the same result at its next meeting. Therefore, in accordance with the mission of the Special Committee as stated in Section 3 of Article 5 of the March 11 resolution, it has decided to begin compiling the draft report stipulated in Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. As for the procedures under Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, only the League of Nations General Assembly can conclude them. Therefore, the Special Committee is of course prepared to welcome any new suggestions that the two parties are willing to put forward.</p>

<p>Today's situation is still far from resolution and has made no progress compared to fourteen months ago. The members are indeed eager to end this fruitless scene, but several members of the Nineteenth Special Committee, including those who most strongly advocate maintaining the League of Nations Covenant, are now proceeding cautiously, fearing that one wrong step will lead to a fall into a dangerous cliff. This is an unprecedented situation, with no precedent to follow. Therefore, the Special Committee often engages in time-consuming and fruitless debates, such as the confusion encountered today over whether the Special Committee has the right to declare the failure of mediation and begin drafting a report. The above-mentioned dispute has been resolved in two ways: (1) Deciding to keep the mediation path nominally open, and (2) Deciding to draft a report and ask the League of Nations General Assembly to pass it. Rumors are now circulating that individuals or small groups within the Nineteenth Special Committee want to propose draft proposals that differ from each other, but each member, in private interviews, said that unity and caution should not be taken for granted. In the hard work of the next few days, it can be said with certainty that Britain will advocate adopting the Lytton Report as much as possible, knowing that the only hope for peace is for China and Japan to approach each other based on the direction indicated in the Lytton Report. Therefore, the report of the Nineteenth Special Committee must be based on the Lytton Report, with attachments whose nature and impact are currently impossible to predict.

<h3 id="e10">The Key to Resolving the Sino-Japanese Case Lies with Britain; Sir Lytton Publishes an Article <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(London) "The Sunday Chronicle" published an article by Sir Lytton, chairman of the Manchurian Investigation Commission. First, he described the various elements of the Far East problem, and then explained the remedies, requesting the League of Nations to make a decision. But what is the possible method? Sir Lytton replied, "Any material action by the powers can be regarded by Japan as a reason for war. Only through spiritual pressure can Japan be made to follow the path of the League of Nations. If the powers in Geneva unanimously approve the League of Nations' resolution against Japan, Japan will sooner or later concede. In short, Britain should bear the greatest responsibility in future events. Whatever the League of Nations should decide, it should be decided. The eyes of the world are now focused on Britain. Britain should take the initiative, because Britain is Japan's former ally. If you want to make Japan approach the League of Nations, it should be guided by Britain. The difficulty of the responsibility borne by politicians in Geneva is probably no greater than that of Foreign Minister Simon." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>According to a Nagoya Shimbun dispatch from Geneva on the 16th, representatives of small Nordic countries have fully understood the truth of the Manchurian problem and the behavior of the Japanese. Now the League's own resolution has created a bad precedent of favoring Japan. In the future, when dealing with European problems, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not follow suit and endanger the positions of the small countries. Therefore, they strongly advocate that Japan withdraw from the League and reduce the scope of the League of Nations to become a European alliance. On the other hand, Spanish representative Madariaga, although not attending the meeting, is still opposing Japan from the sidelines in the capacity of staff. French representatives Caudry and others, with the Radical Socialist Party as their background, represent the Pengu Cabinet and advocate upholding the dignity of the League of Nations, which is increasingly becoming unfavorable.</p>
<p>(Paris) The Socialist Party's newspaper "Le Populaire" commented on the Sino-Japanese incident that the proposal to be put forward by the League of Nations Committee of Nineteen after the failure of the mediation procedures should have the nature of satisfying world opinion, because Japan's military actions have indeed shocked world opinion. In order to satisfy world opinion, the League of Nations should give a serious judgment to the aggressor, because only in this way can world opinion rise up against Japan and economic and diplomatic sanctions can be implemented to stop Japan from annexing Manchuria and Jehol. The League of Nations has wasted precious time, and now it must act as soon as possible. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) The Geneva correspondent of the London Observer reported that people in Geneva now have a very real impression that Britain's attitude towards Japan has become firmer in the past week. Many believe that friendly pressure from the United States may be related to this, but some also say that the reports from the Far East received by the British government have also had an impact. According to this report, the Chinese have expressed resentment at Britain's pro-Japanese attitude, and British trade with China will be affected. Furthermore, if Japan gains greater advantages on the Asian continent, British trade will also suffer. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Instructing him not to rush to withdraw, lest he isolate himself.</p>
<p>He must continue to strive to implement his consistent claims.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs originally expected that the League of Nations' compromise with Japan would not be finalized until British Foreign Minister Simon returned to Geneva. Unexpectedly, the Committee of Nineteen Nations rejected Japan's modifications at the meeting on the 21st and decided to invoke Article 15, Paragraph 4 to forcibly mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was shocked when it heard the news and immediately held an emergency ministerial meeting. It will issue the following telegram to Plenipotentiary Matsuoka tonight or tomorrow morning: (1) The Japanese government sincerely hopes that the harmonious means of Article 15, Paragraph 3 can mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. However, the Committee of Nineteen Nations is so anxious to end the dispute by invoking Article 15, Paragraph 4 that it cannot but consider its harmony a failure. The responsibility should be borne by the League of Nations itself. The delegation should take appropriate opportunities to declare that Japan is not responsible for this. (2) The Japanese government is not afraid to use Paragraph 4. The delegation does not need to take any further action to prevent the League of Nations from invoking the article. (3) There is no need to withdraw from the League of Nations because of the invocation of Paragraph 4, because member states have the right not to accept it. The Japanese government has decided that the delegation will remain in the League of Nations and observe its changes. However, the delegation must step up its efforts to implement Japan's claims.

<p>(Tokyo) With the League of Nations poised to apply Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, the Army authorities issued the following statement last night in the form of a talk: The point of contention between the League of Nations and Japan is that it does not consider the special circumstances of the Far East, but forcefully applies the principles applicable to disputes between modern countries. Small countries unrelated to the Far East are defending themselves, clinging to ideal arguments, and even expressing the attitude of hoping that Japan will withdraw. The situation of advocating the application of Article 15, Paragraph 4 is very strong. The Committee of Nineteen Nations abandoned its efforts to resolve the problem too early and hurriedly sought to end it, openly declaring the League of Nations' own weakness and failure to the world, which is a pity for the League of Nations. If the League of Nations persists to the end, Japan will withdraw without hesitation. Moreover, it does not care about applying Paragraph 4. After self-reflection and correction, I will go even if there are millions of people. It is impossible to predict what will happen after Paragraph 4 is applied. The League of Nations is asking for it itself and should be responsible for all situations arising from it. (Dentsu dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" published the following news today: "On January 15, the Japanese military department published a provocative report in various Japanese newspapers, fabricating rumors about the Soviet government and the future Soviet embassy in China. The report said, "The Third International recently proposed to the Chinese Communist Party to focus its attention on strengthening the Red Army and expressed that it would provide the greatest financial assistance from the Soviet embassy in China, which will be opened soon." It also falsely accused that the Soviet Union and the Chinese government have reached an agreement to develop trade relations between the two countries, the purpose of which is to exclude the goods of other countries from the Chinese market. Therefore, Soviet Ambassador to Japan Taranovsky visited Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Arita on the 19th, representing the Soviet government in protesting against the absurd anti-Soviet news issued by the Japanese military department in the gazette."

<p>Japan's Dream of Expanding Territory Is Far from Being Awakened</p>
<p>Declares That There Can Be No Talk of Compromise Until the Puppet State Is Abolished</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the diplomatic speech made by Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida on the 21st in the Japanese Parliament, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan issued the following statement today: "Foreign Minister Uchida's speech to the Japanese Parliament on the 21st, judging solely from its relationship to Japan's atrocities in the Eastern Provinces, is sufficient to prove that Japan's military aggression and dream of expanding territory are far from being awakened. Since Uchida's first speech on the Far Eastern situation last August, several months have passed, but Uchida has not diminished his public contempt for the authority of the League of Nations, the dignity of international treaties, and the effectiveness of international law. In this speech, Uchida again involved the puppet state of Manchukuo, not only acknowledging its existence as legitimate, but also going further to talk about its possibility of expansion, and publicly declaring Japan's determination to invade Jehol. Such absurd views and arguments, people do not want to waste their time refuting them, because the Chinese government and the League of Nations investigation team have already refuted them completely. What we want to solemnly declare is that China's attitude is very clear and firm, that the puppet state of Manchukuo created and supported by the Japanese must be abolished, and that China must restore its inherent sovereignty in the Eastern Provinces. Before the Japanese puppet organization is formally declared illegal and abolished, so-called mediation, reconciliation, or any other solution is impossible." (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Washington) Red Covenant Forum's commentary stated that Foreign Minister Uchida's speech was tantamount to declaring that international treaties are equal to waste paper and cannot prevent Japan's military desires. Japan's Monroe Doctrine clearly attempts to monopolize the Far East, creating Japan's special undertakings, emulating the United States' prohibition of non-Americans from interfering in American affairs. Furthermore, Japan rashly acts as a Far Eastern policeman, which is not enough to promote peace, but endangers the vested interests of other countries. The Washington Post editorial stated that the war debt issue must be discussed jointly with other important matters, such as the Far Eastern problem and the dignity of treaties.

<p>(Nanjing) Duan Qirui has been away from politics and living in Tianjin, eating vegetarian food and worshiping Buddha for many years. After the Yuguan Incident, the Japanese army's invasion of Jehol became more urgent, and rumors were spread to confuse the public. Duan, aware of the noise and evil environment, resolutely left Tianjin for Beijing on the 20th with Qian Xinzhi, the representative sent by Chairman Chiang to welcome him, and Wu Guangxin, the former Chief of the Army. He arrived in Pukou at 8:00 AM on the 22nd.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Welcoming Personnel <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang sent Zhu Peide, who was also acting as Director of Training, as a representative to welcome him. Other welcomers included Zhang Qun, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Yang Jie, Xu Shiying, Yang Yongtai, Yao Zong, etc., who all gathered at the Xiaguan Ferry Terminal at 7:10 AM and took a ferry across the river to Pukou to welcome him. Members of the Anhui Association in Beijing brought white cloth banners with the words "Welcome Mr. Duan, the Creator of the Three Republics" and "Welcome Mr. Duan, the Veteran of Anti-Japanese and National Salvation." In total, there were about a hundred people who came to the station to welcome him.</p>
<h3 id="e20">State of Alert <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>This morning, the Xiaguan area, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the Capital Police Department were ordered to increase patrols and security. In addition to the Jilu Railway Police adding posts at Pukou Station and the Ferry Terminal, the Gendarmerie Headquarters and the Capital Police Department sent out gendarmerie police to take charge of security.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Arrival at the Station <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Duan took two special sleeping cars prepared by the Jilu Railway, attached to car "202" heading south, using two locomotives to pull and push. He arrived at Pukou at 8:00 AM sharp. After Mr. Duan's car drove into the platform, the welcoming personnel successively boarded the car to pay their respects. Mr. Duan met them one by one in the carriage, nodding in greeting. Mr. Duan was dressed in a robe and mandarin jacket yesterday, with a fox fur coat and a black velvet square top hat. His spirit was slightly weak, but when he spoke, he was energetic. Although he needed support when walking, he was not hunchbacked. In addition to Qian Yongming and Wu Guangxin, those who accompanied Duan south this time included Wei Zonghan, the former commander of the Ninth Division, and Duan's nephew Hong, as well as a servant. There was a lot of luggage.</p>

<p>After Mr. Duan met the welcoming personnel, Yao Zong immediately asked Mr. Duan to get out of the car and board the rattan sedan chair prepared on the platform, which was carried to the ferry terminal. The accompanying personnel and welcoming personnel also successively walked out of the platform and boarded the Chengping Ferry together. The ferry set sail across the river at 8:15 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Conversation on the Ferry <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>On the ferry, Mr. Duan was introduced by Xu Shiying to talk to the welcoming personnel. He praised Chief Supervisor Zhu Peide and others quite a bit. Then he talked to Yang Jie, the commander of the Yangtze River Fortress, saying that when I (Duan referring to himself) was the Chief of the Army in the first year of the Republic, I advocated strengthening the construction of the Yangtze River Fortress so that it could become a weapon for national defense. Otherwise, the door would be wide open, and how could it not be taken advantage of by the violent enemy? His words seemed to be full of emotion. Later, he said that he did not want to be entertained by all parties during this trip south. In Beijing, he could stay at his sister's house at No. 19 Shenjia Lane, and then go to Shanghai. He was then informed that the Lishi Society had already prepared everything, and Mr. Duan agreed not to go to his sister's house, but to stay at the Lishi Society.</p>

<p>The Chengping Ferry arrived at Xiaguan at 8:30 AM. Mr. Duan originally planned to go ashore immediately and enter the city, but at that time he received a call from the Military Affairs Committee, saying that Chairman Chiang had already arrived in his own car to welcome him. After hearing the news, Mr. Duan repeatedly said "No need" "No need", I can go to meet him. Chiang's car had arrived at the terminal, and he immediately abandoned the car and boarded the ferry to pay his respects, performing the ceremony of teacher and student, and frequently inquired about his health. Duan replied that his leg had been sick for years, making walking difficult. In recent months, his stomach had been sick and he had eaten little. It can be seen that he was old and weak. Fortunately, he had been feeling comfortable recently. After the greetings, Chiang immediately asked Duan to get off the ferry and board Chiang's own car, No. 318. Duan sat in the middle, and Chiang and Wu Guangxin sat on the left and right, and immediately sped towards the Lishi Society. The welcoming personnel and Mr. Duan's entourage also rushed to get on the bus and enter the city. The luggage was sent by the Lishi Society to be loaded into cars and transported to the Lishi Society residence.</p>

<p>After Mr. Duan's car arrived at the Lishi Society, he went upstairs and talked with Chairman Chiang for forty minutes. Then he met Ma Liang and others, and had some tea and snacks. Then he answered the questions asked by reporters in writing as follows: (Reporter asked) What are Mr. Duan's opinions on resisting Japan? (Mr. Duan replied) At this time of national crisis, the government already has a whole set of policies and methods for defending against insults. Regardless of whether it is in the government or in the opposition, we should all rise up to support it. Although Rui is old, he should also strive to follow the people of the country. (Asked) How does Mr. Duan feel about this trip south? (Answer) It has been more than ten years since I have been to Nanjing. What I have seen and heard here is completely (continues on page 6)</p>

<p>new. Everyone from Commander-in-Chief Chiang down is full of vigor, and I deeply admire them. However, passing through the residences along the way, I still feel that there is a phenomenon of dilapidation and disrepair. From this, it can be known the suffering of the villagers. Cultivating vitality still requires effort. (Asked) Can Mr. Duan tell us about his future whereabouts? (Answer) My sister is in Beijing and my youngest daughter lives in Shanghai. I have long wanted to come south when the spring is warm, but because the national crisis is becoming more urgent, Commander-in-Chief Chiang and various circles in Shanghai all hope to advance the trip. In addition, Envoy Qian Xinzhi personally urged me to leave immediately. The time of the delay has not yet been determined. Mr. Duan ended by saying that Rui is a national who is willing to help with the crisis and dares not fall behind. He is deeply ashamed and grateful for the welcome from Commander-in-Chief Chiang and all circles.</p>

Now, when he is in Beijing, in order to admire the remains of the Premier, he set off on the 23rd to visit the mausoleum on Zijin Mountain and respectfully present a wreath.

<p>At 11:00 AM, Duan Qirui traveled by car to the military academy to return the visit of Chairman Jiang, spoke for half an hour, and returned to the Lìzhì Society. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, he led his entourage to Yìjiàqiáo to visit his younger sister, Madam Chen, and inquired about her recent situation. At 7:00 PM that evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Jiang. Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Qun, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Shiying, and others were all invited to accompany him. Duan is scheduled to go to Shanghai by train on the evening of the 23rd. Duan's nephew, Hong Tan, said that Duan has been living in Tianjin in seclusion for almost ten years, not asking about worldly affairs. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have repeatedly spread rumors in an attempt to discredit him. In fact, although Duan is old, his nationalistic thinking is very strong, so how could he resort to such a poor strategy? The people of the country should remain calm and unite to resist foreign aggression, and not be misled by these rumors. Duan has no specific plans for the major strategy of resisting Japan. If the government seeks his advice, he will provide references based on his experiences. He does not plan to stay in Beijing for long and plans to go to Shanghai on the evening of the 23rd. Jiang has already sent Qian Xinzhi to Shanghai to find a residence for him. In Shanghai, he plans to stay for a week or so, and then go to Putuo Temple in Hangzhou for a tour, enjoying the spring scenery of the Jiangnan region. The date of his return north has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army, seeing that our defense in Chaoyang and Kailu is very strict, combined with high mountains and steep ridges, rendering tanks and armored vehicles ineffective, is preparing to change its strategy. The Japanese 8th Division stationed at Yaowangmiao in Lingnan and a part of the Mogi Cavalry Brigade attacking Yu County will attack Lingyuan from Lingnan. These are all main roads. Currently, the Japanese are advancing through surveying and mapping from Lingnan County. In the main road gully of the first district of Lingnan, more than 500 Japanese cavalry and infantry of the 8th Division have been discovered, along with military supplies and four tanks. Zheng Guilin, the Righteous Army of Lingyuan County, upon hearing the news, led his troops to cut off the enemy's rear route. Our garrison, the 254th Brigade of Lingyuan County, has already taken strict precautions. Rumors are rampant in Lingyuan. County Magistrate Zhang Danchi held a meeting with local groups to discuss resistance measures. On the 21st, a Japanese aircraft from the Jinzhou Aircraft Factory flew to Lingyuan County for reconnaissance. When passing the Lingyuan County Government, it mistook our Public Security Bureau and the Public Security Cavalry Unit as military garrisons and scattered a large number of red and green paper leaflets. It flew east for about fifteen minutes without dropping bombs. (Special dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy has repeatedly provoked our Nanling positions with artillery fire, but has been repulsed by our troops. Seeing that our Kailu and Nanling area's positions are solid and difficult to capture, the military invasion of Rehe seems to be focusing on Lingyuan and Jiumenkou in Jinxi. Therefore, the enemy's heavy troops are concentrated between Suizhong, Xingcheng, and Yuguan. Yesterday, the enemy's Mogi Cavalry Unit, about 1,200 men, and 500 infantrymen, carrying four tanks and eight field guns, moved from the Lingyuan Avenue outside Jiumenkou towards the Rehe border of Lingyuan. They have already made contact with Zheng Guilin's outposts in the main road gully of Shanzuizi. Our Righteous Army is currently uniting with the militia in the Chapeng area to fight back.

<p>(Beiping) Our troops have built several defensive lines in a certain area west of the Shi River. Defenses have also been set up near Shimen Village and the Liujiang River. Jiumenkou is still guarded by a certain brigade. Defenses are very strict along the avenue from Jiumenkou to Pingquan. Outside Jiumenkou, the number of puppet troops has increased to more than 3,000. Zhang Jinghui, the commander-in-chief of the puppet army, arrived in Jinzhou from Changchun a few days ago to inspect and discuss the military invasion of Rehe with Yoshiichi Nishi, the commander of the Japanese 8th Division. A part of the Suzuki Brigade has been withdrawn from Yuguan City to Jinzhou, and the 4th Regiment has been transferred to fill the defense. More than a dozen artillery emplacements have been built at the west gate of Yuguan. Three trains of armored vehicles are parked at the station. Police of the puppet state patrol inside and outside Yuguan City. Japanese and Manchukuo flags are hung at the station. Refugees fleeing Yuguan City are not allowed to go west. The Japanese army has dispatched more than 20 sentries along the South China Sea. The fare for rickshaws from Yuguan to Qinhuangdao is about fifteen yuan.

<p>(Beiping) Wu Peifu said that the loss of Yuguan means that the overall situation in North China is in danger. There is no way out except to fight the Japanese. If the people of the country can fully realize this and concentrate their strength to resist Japan, there will definitely be a considerable chance of success in the future. He hopes that the people of the country will automatically unite to resist Japan. He previously received telegrams from various groups in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce saying what they would do, but he only smiled at them. Mr. Zhichuan's entry into Beijing this time has opened a bright path for the current situation. The Beijing authorities have repeatedly sent special envoys here, hoping that he would go to Beijing, but he has no intention of going to Beijing for the time being. If he suddenly goes south, rumors will inevitably arise. It is shameful for foreigners that many wealthy families in Beiping and Tianjin have moved. If everyone can use the money spent on moving to disaster relief, more lives will be saved. He will not lag behind in resisting Japan, but he does not want to express his opinions on politics.

<h3 id="e43">Today's Two Major Problems <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Today, there are two major problems obstructing our view. One is "resisting Japan," and the other is "stabilizing the lives of the masses." Stabilizing the lives of the masses is "pacifying the interior," while resisting Japan is "repelling foreign aggression."</p>
<p>What does it mean to say that those who talk about saving the country today all say that saving the country should start with "pacifying the interior?" However, how can the interior be pacified? It cannot be done with force, nor can it be done with small favors. The only way is to stop the source of the chaos. Where does the chaos come from? From hunger and cold. Xunzi did not say, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient do people know honor and disgrace." When people have no food to eat and no clothes to wear, the old and weak wander, and the young and strong are displaced. If they fill the wilderness with starvation, and are driven by the necessities of life, how can the people not be in chaos? The world has no people who like chaos, only the masses who take risks. When driven by the necessities of life, a single person calls out at night, and responses arise from all around. Examining historical records, they are full of examples. The people already do not know where they will die. If they are threatened with force and fear of death, how is this different from pouring soup to stop boiling? If the source of the chaos is not stopped, how can the chaos be quelled? Therefore, the only way for us to talk about pacifying the interior today is to "stabilize the lives of the people," so that everyone has food to eat and clothes to wear. In good years, they are well-fed and warm, and in bad years, they will not be displaced. The people know the joy of living and will naturally not be willing to take risks to make decisions. If not, officials are well-fed and comfortable, while the people are both cold and hungry, compounded by natural and man-made disasters, and extorted by arbitrary levies and taxes. The people have nowhere to cry out. As last winter, there were 4,000 disaster victims in Henan who fled to Tianjin to escape death. They were not allowed to enter and were sent south. The south also telegraphed a refusal. They wandered along the roads, and the officials turned a blind eye and pushed the responsibility on each other. Then what value do the people place on having a country? Therefore, today, talking about stabilizing the lives of the people is naturally the responsibility of the government, and there is no room for shirking or delaying.</p>
<p>What does it mean to say "resisting Japan?" Since September 18th, Japan has wanted to strangle our throats every day and seize our lives with one move. Its continental policy has been thought out carefully and thoroughly. For a year, Japan's atrocities against us have only increased and have never stopped. This is by no means accidental. Even the silence and observation of the great powers, who are unwilling to make righteous statements, each has its own political and economic background, and there is a reason for this. Our policy of non-resistance cannot stop the invaders from moving forward, nor can appeals to the world and complaints win us fair assistance. Then what else can we expect and what else can we hope for today other than to seek self-defense and self-salvation through our own efforts? What is the way to self-defense and self-salvation? It is resistance. It is struggle. With the greatest determination, we can fight with all our might and eventually achieve the final victory. Otherwise, we will be timid and seek temporary peace, neither fighting nor making peace, and be slaughtered by others. In fact, we are just waiting for death.</p>
<p>The people are suffering deeply today. However, we dare to say that their suffering is for the sake of protecting the survival of our nation and for resisting the aggression of the violent. Then, no matter how much suffering there is, our people will have no complaints. This is for the masses to seek the last way out. There is no way to get it without suffering. If the suffering is not for resisting violence, but merely consumes the spirit and wealth of saving the country in the dark and invisible, then foreign troubles and internal worries will oppress each other. The future of our country will be in great difficulty. We really do not know how it will end.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of the current situation, "resisting Japan" and "stabilizing the lives of the people" are both the most urgent and serious problems at present. But weighing the urgency and importance, we believe that "resisting Japan" is even more urgent than "stabilizing the lives of the people."</p>

<p>Using Radio Broadcast Power for Home Lighting and Electric Furnaces</p>
<p>Gatineau, 20th (National News Agency) - Young inventor Fette unveiled a new invention here today: using radio broadcast power to supply home lighting and electric furnaces. The method is similar to radio broadcasting. Fette is only 22 years old and was previously an insurance manager. He is now dedicated to radio research. It is said that he has been able to apply radio theory to transmitting electrical energy. He invited many engineers from Toronto to explain his theory. Subsequently, someone provided him with $30,000 as financial support. However, he declined to reveal the person's name. During the test, he received radio waves from two houses away and generated electrical light. The required transmission lines and receivers are similar to those used in wireless telephones. The estimated manufacturing cost is not high, and it is not difficult to sell each unit for a low price of five gold yuan in order to promote widespread adoption. He will demonstrate his new invention in Montreal.</p>

<p>Lyon, 21st (Havas News Agency) - Former Prime Minister Herriot published a declaration in "Le Démocrate," advising the various factions of the majority party in parliament to facilitate the government's financial plans, as such plans are essential given the current situation. Regarding foreign policy, Herriot stated that the three major democracies of France, Britain, and the United States should unite with each other and seek national security through peace.

<p>Washington, 21st (National News Agency) - According to a report from London, some people in the British government believe that the United States will insist that Britain restore the gold standard before negotiating war debts. Upon hearing this, a statement was issued here stating that the United States has never mentioned the restoration of the gold standard. Yesterday's meeting between the two presidents and their advisors discussed Britain's request to open negotiations on war debts. Since Britain had already paid the war debt due in December, it was decided to grant their request. The rumor that the United States would insist on restoring the gold standard seems to have originated from the report of the experts preparing for the Geneva World Economic Conference, which suggested that countries should restore the gold standard. The US representative, William, participated in drafting the report and advocated for European countries to restore the gold standard. However, William did not insist that the recommendation to restore the gold standard be included in the report. The US State Department also stated today that it was acting on its own initiative and did not have instructions from the government. US officials are currently not commenting on William's proposal and have not publicly expressed support. As for the war debt issue, given the current situation, negotiations will proceed regardless of whether Britain restores the gold standard or not.</p>
<p>Currently, within the United States, since the President-elect Roosevelt expressed his approval yesterday for Secretary of State Stimson to prepare for the war debt conference, a good impression has been formed among senators and representatives. Senator Borah assured that the British-American war debt conference would lead to an international conference to discuss all economic issues related to major countries. The conference agenda will have no restrictions, so he deeply appreciates Roosevelt's wise decision. However, Republican Senator Robinson still expressed his disapproval, saying that this move is a prelude to canceling or reducing war debts. He still supports the reservations stated by the Senate when former President Hoover proposed a one-year moratorium, and does not allow any further changes to the war debt solution.</p>
<p>Currently, experts from the State Department and Treasury Department have begun preparing a negotiating basis and will work closely with Democrat Moley and Roosevelt's other advisors. It is also reported that the two governments will agree on a procedure through existing diplomatic channels so that representatives of both countries can be certain of the proposals to be discussed before the meeting in February.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Hitler Party Stormtroopers Parade; Berliners Greatly Shaken <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (National News Agency) - Today, after German Chancellor Schleicher met with Interior Minister Bracht, it was decided to allow the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers to depart from the front of the Communist Party headquarters in Bülow tomorrow for a demonstration parade. However, to prevent clashes between the two parties, an order has been issued prohibiting the Communist Party from gathering for demonstrations in most parts of Berlin tomorrow. At the same time, the police were ordered to be on high alert, as the Interior Minister believes that the National Socialist Party's plan will not disturb public order. Currently, right-wing newspapers naturally welcome the government's determination to deal with the Communist Party, but Republican newspapers are harshly criticizing it, considering it an unnecessary risk and accusing the authorities of negligence, saying that this is tantamount to playing with fire, and there is a risk of a prairie fire once it starts. The people are also quite worried about this, so the Christian trade union affiliated with the Centre Party also submitted a letter to the police authorities today protesting the stormtroopers' parade plan, but it was politely rejected by the Berlin Police Commissioner.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Reuters) - The National Socialist Party gathered on Bülow today, and Berliners were greatly shaken. This morning, the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party had several small clashes. National Socialist Party members and the party's stormtroopers were all wearing uniforms, and several labor groups marched from various parts of Berlin to Bülow Square. A large team of foot and mounted police was stationed there, each holding a rifle, and troops in armed vehicles assisted in maintaining order. At 11:30 this morning, the police searched the Communist Party headquarters on Bülow and evicted 400 people from the building.</p>

<p>The Papen Cabinet was a cabinet of the President, with no parliamentarians among its members. At the same time, it was also a disguised fascist cabinet. However, Papen himself was not a member of Hitler's National Socialist Party. What was his relationship with the Hitler Party? Originally, when Papen formed his cabinet, it was only in name, and the actual Prime Minister was Hitler. Therefore, although Prime Minister Papen was known for his cunning plots, he was actually a puppet Prime Minister. So what was the relationship between the Papen government and the Hitler Party? Broadly speaking, the Papen cabinet was under Hitler's guidance. In terms of power relations, General Schleicher, the Minister of Defense in the Papen cabinet, held the real power of the national defense forces and could command everything politically. In terms of the social foundation of this political relationship, the National Socialist Party was formed by the large landowners, heavy industrial capitalists, and military forces of Prussia.</p>
<p>German fascists (National Socialist Party) differ from Italian fascists. The Italian fascist regime was from the bottom up. After the March on Rome, they gained power. Germany is different. The National Socialist Party led by Hitler never marched on Berlin (although there are small conflicts in the streets every day, these conflicts are just brawls and do not count as political bloodshed). And the organization of the National Socialist Party is from top to bottom (the emerging capitalist forces in Germany are not very strong, and the organization of the proletariat and laborers from the Social Democratic Party to the Communist Party is very powerful). Therefore, the National Socialist Party has large landowners, financial capital, heavy industrial capitalists, and soldiers as its core, and the middle class with white-collar workers as the masses. Before the election on July 30th of this year, the National Socialist Party can be considered at its peak. The future of Germany was almost entirely in Hitler's hands. However, after the election, he did not get more than half of the seats. He had no possibility of dominating the political situation of the German Federation. So the Hitler Party was like the afternoon sun, and can only gradually decline from now on. Even if it still has some life, it can no longer have greater development. This is because of social power relations. Even if the parliament is dissolved several times and the elections are repeated several times, there will be no special changes. So the result of the general election on November 6th was that although Hitler still led the first party, he lost 35 seats. After the defeat of the Papen-Schleicher faction, political power became even more unstable. After December 3rd, the crown of Prime Minister of the German Federal Cabinet fell to General Schleicher. Needless to say, this is even more of a President's cabinet, and it is a purely military cabinet.</p>
<p>When Prime Minister Schleicher took office, he immediately issued a presidential order to repeal three articles of the "Law for the Protection of the Republic" promulgated by the former Papen cabinet, namely: 1. Abolishing the provision for special trials for political prisoners; 2. Abolishing the law requiring mandatory publication of government official statements; 3. Although the protection of the Republican system still exists, the ban on the return of former German Emperor Wilhelm II to Germany was removed. Whether the former Emperor will return to the country without any scruples is still a question. However, this is a major issue in Europe that is worth noting. First, why did the current government specifically order the lifting of the ban on the Kaiser's return to the country? Second, Germany is now in chaos and weak, and is about to reach the end of its rope. Is it necessary to use restoration to stir up people's hearts? The analysis of the first question is of course very subtle, and there will inevitably be many superficial observations. It is generally believed that the current President Hindenburg is a marshal, and Schleicher is also a general. The movement of German politics is accompanied by the sound of sabers. This is the rise of militarism, so it is inferred that it will lead to the restoration of the imperial system. In fact, things are not so simple. The current German soldiers cannot be completely represented by Marshal Hindenburg, who came from East Prussia. The officers in southern Germany are relatively liberal-minded. For example, former Minister of Defense General Groener was the initiator of advocating the abdication of the Emperor. The current Prime Minister General Schleicher also came from a poor peasant family. They do not necessarily have a conspiracy to restore the imperial system. The second question is no different from the deduction of the first question, but as far as the National Socialist Party is concerned, it is also very different from the National People's Party, which represents the remains of the landlords and nobles east of the Elbe River. They want to change the Lesser Germany ideology into the Greater Germany ideology. They have the spirit of the Holy Roman Empire, so although they show some goodwill to the former Emperor, they do not advocate restoration. Moreover, on the one hand, there is the Communist Party in the middle, and on the other hand, the Kaiser has already expressed his unwillingness to return to the country. Therefore, the main reason why the Schleicher cabinet abolished the ban on the Kaiser's return to the country is just a tactic to ease the antipathy of the National Socialist Party, the National People's Party, and the right-wing parties.

<p>Two Million Dollars Remitted by the Puppet State as Activity Funds</p>
<p>Meizu, Sakahara, Dohihara, and Others All Arrive in Tianjin</p>
<p>Han Traitor Leader Hao Peng Has Been Arrested in Peiping</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Figures in the Puppet Autonomous National Salvation Army</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the fall of Yuguan, rumors have been rampant in Peiping and Tianjin, and people are in a state of panic. The British and French concessions in Tianjin are already showing signs of being overcrowded. To complicate things, Dohihara Kenji, the instigator of the Tianjin Incident of the year before last, arrived in Tianjin the day before yesterday, further intensifying the rumors. Additionally, last night, on the folk custom day of sending off the Kitchen God, there were loud cannon sounds in the British and French concessions. The citizens, already jumpy, inevitably suspected a major change upon hearing the booming sounds. After inquiries, it was found that the Japanese concession was as peaceful as ever, and everyone realized it was a false alarm. According to reliable sources, the individuals plotting disturbances in Peiping and Tianjin this time are not the same as those from the year before last. This is because Li Jichun has gone to Guanwai, and Hao Peng, the former Finance Director under Chu Yupu's rule in Zhili, along with Zhang Bi, are in charge of everything. Hao Peng was arrested in Peiping on the 10th of this month, which will undoubtedly be a major blow to the sabotage efforts. Unexpectedly, these individuals have been relentless and have intensified their secret operations. Recently, the puppet state of Manchukuo remitted two million dollars from its Central Bank to Tianjin, depositing it in the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Korea. Sakahara, a high-ranking advisor to the puppet state, was assigned to oversee the use of these funds, and Dohihara was assigned to design the disruptions. The Japanese General Staff also dispatched Major General Meizu to provide instructions on the strategy of attacking Rehe and disturbing Peiping and Tianjin. It is learned that Sakahara arrived at Tanggu on the Jitong Maru from Dalian on the 15th of this month and immediately took a train to Peiping, where he held an all-night meeting at the Japanese Embassy. He then came to Tianjin on the 16th and is staying at the Tokiwa Hotel in the Japanese concession. There are rumors that Meizu traveled with Sakahara, but inquiries from various sources have not revealed any trace of Meizu. Inquiries to the Japanese side also stated that Meizu is still on the Southern Manchuria and Pseudo-Fengshan lines. Dohihara, acting on orders from the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters, traveled from Changchun to Dalian with Chief of Staff Iso, and arrived in Tianjin on the Changping Maru at midnight on the 16th. He disembarked at the Dalian dock. Some people saw him wearing dark crystal glasses on his nose and dressed in Chinese clothing, apparently trying to avoid attention, but he was still recognized. Several Han traitors were also traveling with him, but it was late at night and in a rush, so they could not be identified. After landing, these individuals split into two cars and sped off to the Japanese Army Headquarters at Haiguang Temple, where they met with the Japanese Army Commander, Koutaro Nakamura. Sakahara was also invited to attend the meeting, which did not break up until dawn on the 17th. Dohihara and the others then went to the Tokiwa Hotel to rest. On the evening of the 17th, these individuals gathered again at the Japanese Consulate General for a meeting that lasted late into the night. The content of the two meetings was extremely secret. It is reported that Dohihara left Tianjin yesterday (the 19th), with some saying he went to Peiping and others saying he returned to Changchun. It is unknown which is true. In any case, the cholera bacteria of Tianjin are quietly growing and spreading, and there will inevitably be a day of massive vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>According to a certain military expert, the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, nominally a regiment, actually consists of less than 1,500 men, with about 2,000 veterans in the area. Our troops stationed in the four rural districts of Tianjin are already prepared. Furthermore, the plainclothes teams organized by general traitors are all rabble. The Japanese are only using them as a fuse. However, one thing is particularly noteworthy: after the Tianjin Incident of the year before last, the Japanese secretly purchased land between Haiguang Temple and Bali Terrace Fort to the south, ostensibly establishing industrial companies and racetracks, but in reality, they have invisibly built a large airfield. According to information leaked by the Japanese side, there are two medium-sized fighter planes in the hangar of the airfield, and two large fighter planes are stored in the Japanese barracks at Haiguang Temple. The airfield is now a forbidden zone for the Japanese, and we have no way to investigate its reality. Here is an investigation report on the traitorous plainclothes team: (1) The background of the plainclothes team is two specialists dispatched by the Japanese Army Ministry to disrupt North China: Okazaki Tetsuichi and Hasegawa; (2) The leader of the plainclothes team is Hao Peng, the former Finance Director of Zhili Province, who was arrested in Peiping on the 10th of this month; (3) The cadres of the plainclothes team are Zhang Bi and Zhu Zijun, formerly regimental commanders of the Zhili-Shandong Army; Liu Yide, who is currently recruiting bandits in Dezhou and Cangzhou; Han Guodong, formerly a brigade commander of the Zhili-Shandong Army; Liu Xuehai, formerly a battalion commander of the Zhili-Shandong Army; and He Zhongsan, formerly an adjutant to Liu Guitang; (4) The organization of the plainclothes team is named the North China People's Autonomous National Salvation Army, with Hao Peng as commander-in-chief, Zhang Bi as deputy commander-in-chief, Zhu Zijun as chief of staff, Liu Yide as adjutant general, Han Guodong as commander-in-chief, Liu Xuehai as commander of the first army, He Zhongsan as commander of the second army, and Feng Lindong as commander of the third army; (5) Strength: The confirmed number of those lying in wait in the Japanese Concession is about one thousand; it is said that there are ten thousand in the outer counties, but this is exaggerated and unreliable; (6) Economic sources: Hao Peng borrowed 20,000 dollars from Okazaki in his name as secret operating expenses; after the launch, Okazaki is responsible for military pay, with Hasegawa and others signing as witnesses; (7) Weapons: The plainclothes team lying in wait in the Japanese Concession currently has one rifle for every three people; when the launch occurs, Okazaki will supply a large quantity. After Hao Peng was captured in Peiping on the 10th of this month, our local authorities have been severely cracking down on the remaining traitors. These individuals know that their crimes are heinous and are fleeing into hiding. (January 20th)</p>
<p>The Northeast Problem and the League of Nations (18)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Japanese Request for Instructions After Submission to the Assembly <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>"Matsuoka": I would like to first express the Japanese delegation's gratitude to the Chairman of the Administrative Council for his sincerity in earnestly seeking a solution to our current dispute. We are extremely grateful for the Chairman's efforts and his capable guidance. Regarding the current issues before the Administrative Council, I firmly believe that they should be considered by the Administrative Council itself. The Administrative Council has received the report from the Investigation Committee, and the report also proposes several solutions to the Administrative Council. However, these points are merely suggestions. In the view of the Japanese government, the Administrative Council should conduct its own research on the issue and seek ways for both sides to come closer. The suggestions made by the Investigation Committee to the Administrative Council cannot be easily agreed to, and it is also questionable whether the Investigation Committee has the authority to make suggestions or issue conclusions. In my observation, the Investigation Committee does not have such authority. The Japanese government has submitted a memorandum of opinion to the Administrative Council regarding the report, clearly explaining all the points that disagree with the report in detail. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that it will gladly accept any proposals from the League of Nations, but in fact, up to this point, China has taken no action other than accusations and condemnations. As the Chairman said, the Chinese government's attitude towards the report, other than agreeing in principle to the third point, "any solution should comply with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty," is not clearly expressed. The government represented by the Chinese representatives has not fulfilled its obligations under those treaties. During the Administrative Council meetings in October, November, and December of last year, the Japanese government expressed its willingness to engage in direct negotiations with the Chinese government based on the five principles proposed by the Chinese government. The Japanese government firmly believed at the time that this suggestion was the most concrete way to seek a satisfactory solution to the entire issue, and its spirit has also been recognized by the Investigation Committee report, as the Investigation Committee advocates direct negotiations. Unfortunately, in the autumn of last year, the Administrative Council did not agree with Japan's proposal, and as a result, the situation in Manchuria developed according to its natural course. To this day, its status is no longer reversible. Since the Chairman has proposed submitting the entire case to the Assembly for resolution, the discussion will probably proceed according to Article 15 of the Covenant. Regarding this proposal, I can only express my personal opinion at this time and telegraph Tokyo for instructions. Once the instructions are received, I will notify the Chairman immediately. I firmly believe that if this case is submitted to the Assembly for resolution in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant, the Assembly's responsibility should be to do everything possible to seek a solution that both sides can compromise on. If that is the case, then whether the case is resolved in accordance with Article 11 of the Covenant or in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 3, it will still lead to the same destination by different routes. This is my personal opinion. Furthermore, I believe that any solution that is not agreed to by both parties to the dispute cannot be considered satisfactory. For such an important matter, it is impossible to force any party to accept a solution. The League of Nations will certainly not seek the complete agreement of both parties, and I certainly cannot express my approval until complete agreement is obtained. This is why the Japanese government submitted reservations to Article 13 of the Covenant this spring. It goes without saying that the establishment of world peace is the common desire of all member states of the League of Nations. The purpose of the League of Nations itself is also there. Japan is no less devoted to this desire than any other country. We do need peace, but what we need is not just peace on paper, but peace based on facts. The various actions taken by Japan since last year have been based on this creed. Japan firmly believes that the only way to guarantee the establishment of solid peace in East Asia is to continue to proceed in accordance with Japan's policy of officially recognizing the new state of "Manchukuo." This is the only and reliable way to achieve our shared desire for consistent peace. As for the points mentioned by the Chairman, I reserve the right to speak at the next meeting.</p>
<p>"Chairman": If my understanding is correct, the Japanese representative intends to request instructions from his government on this matter. I wonder how long it will take for the request and the reply to be exchanged.</p>
<p>"Matsuoka": Although I cannot determine a specific date, I expect to receive a reply tomorrow, or at the latest, Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e96">China Agrees to Transfer to the Assembly <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>"Representative Gu": I would like to express my support for the Chairman's proposal to transfer the Investigation Committee's report and the debates between China and Japan to the Assembly for resolution. The Chinese delegation fully agrees that this case should be resolved by the Assembly, as the special Assembly has officially been given all the facts pertaining to this dispute. Regarding the remarks I made in the past few days, the Chairman pointed out that I have not yet indicated the Chinese government's views on the last two chapters of the report, which is true. Among the ten principles in the report, the third is one that China can fully agree with, and regarding the other principles, China reserves the right to express its opinions later. The reason for this is that, first, the responsibility for finding a way to resolve the case now belongs to the Assembly, and as far as I know, the representatives of the Administrative Council are also willing to express their opinions in the Assembly, so I also wish to reserve the Chinese government's opinions for the Assembly meetings. Second, the reason why I did not express the Chinese government's opinions is due to the attitude of the Japanese representative, whose first speech did not show any trace of respect for the fundamental principles of peace and international obligations upon which the League of Nations is based, as the Chairman had hoped. After listening carefully to his speech, I felt that there was no intention of making any concessions. Therefore, I felt that even if the Chinese government's views on the other parts of the report were expressed, it would not help matters. Just now, the Japanese representative suddenly made the first concession to me in fifteen months and asked me to speak first. At that time, not only I personally, but also all the representatives of the Administrative Council, had a kind of hope, but this hope was like a flash in the pan, fleeting in an instant. My failure to accept the Japanese representative's kind intentions was not because I did not appreciate the spirit of his concession, but because I hoped that this concession was only the beginning, and that after I reciprocated his spirit of concession, the Japanese representative might make a second concession and express at least in principle acceptance of the third principle of Chapter IX of the Investigation Committee's report, acknowledging that any solution should be in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. I fully hoped that the Japanese representative would certainly accept this principle, as China and Japan are both signatories to those treaties and both members of the League of Nations. However, my hopes have been dashed. The Japanese representative did not make a second concession, but instead went backwards and made accusations against the Chinese government, which were completely unfounded, because China has always fully complied with the above-mentioned treaties and has never violated them, as the members of the Administrative Council are well aware. However, the Japanese representative has expressed one point, which is that Japan has recognized "Manchukuo" and that any peace, if it is a true peace, must be based on facts. But should we only pursue facts here, and set aside all justice and the common interests of world peace? Should the organization of the League of Nations only recognize facts, and not uphold the peace, justice, and legality upon which it is based? What China opposes is the idea of ​​creating a solution based on the existing fait accompli. The Chinese government will gladly accept any solution based on principles that we all accept. The Chinese government will also gladly accept any solution based on facts created in accordance with the provisions of international treaties. However, as the Japanese representative said, a solution to this case should be based on recognizing "Manchukuo", then China cannot accept it at all. The Japanese representative expressed doubts about whether the Investigation Committee could offer its views and suggestions. This matter can be explained by the Investigation Committee itself or by the members of the Administrative Council and the procedures of the Administrative Council, as some of you have been representatives of the Administrative Council since the establishment of the League of Nations, and your experience is far greater than mine. Finally, I would like to reiterate my agreement with the Chairman's proposal to transfer the Investigation Committee's report and the opinions of China and Japan to the Assembly for resolution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"Matsuoka": I would like to express my gratitude to my Chinese friend, the Chinese representative, for his kind intentions towards me. However, I must reserve the right to criticize what he has said. The Chinese representative still has doubts about my use of the word "facts". Now, please allow me to clarify. By facts, I mean all facts, including the League of Nations, all treaties, and everything that exists in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Decision to Reconvene Next Monday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Chairman said, the representatives of the Administrative Council have heard the Japanese representative's request and the time limit, so that he can ask Tokyo to submit the report and the opinions of both parties to the Assembly meeting. Is the Administrative Council willing to allow that request? Does anyone object? (No one objects.) In that case, will the Japanese representative be able to receive a reply from Tokyo by tomorrow afternoon?</p>
<p>"Matsuoka": I will do my best, but I cannot determine a specific time limit.</p>
<p>"Chairman": In that case, to be on the safe side, we might as well set the meeting for eleven o'clock next Monday.</p>
<p>"Matsuoka": We must understand that this is a very serious issue for Japan. I certainly cannot speak for the government, so I cannot determine the time limit now, but I will do my best to get a reply from the government as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"Chairman": If the representatives of the Administrative Council can agree, then we might as well decide to include this case on the agenda for eleven o'clock next Monday. There will be no meeting tomorrow, so our discussion of this case has been postponed until eleven o'clock on Monday (the 28th). (End)</p>
<p>Public Memorial Service for Battalion Commander An in Peiping</p>
<h3 id="e98">An's Coffin to Be Transported Back to Baoding for Burial <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The coffin of An Dexin, the battalion commander of the Ninth Brigade who died with Yuguan, has been transported to Peiping by the military authorities and temporarily placed in the Qingzhen Mosque in Jiaozihu Tong. On the 19th, people from all walks of life held a public memorial service. Many military and political figures and fellow Muslims attended. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e99">Situation of the Funeral Hall <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>An's coffin was placed in the two palace rooms of the mosque. A memorial shed was erected high in the courtyard, with elegiac couplets and wreaths sent by various circles, about a hundred items. Wan Fulin, Shao Wenkai, Bao Yulin, and others all sent elegiac couplets and wreaths. Other groups and Muslim organizations also sent elegiac couplets and wreaths, a dazzling array, with almost no space on the walls. An incense table was set up in front of the spirit, with elegiac couplets from Zhang Xueliang hanging on both sides, with the text: "Guarding the land together, the vanguard makes me the spirit of the three armies," "Wielding a spear, thinking bravely and decisively, history transmits this name for a hundred generations." The scene in the room was solemn, inspiring thoughts of reverence.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Process of Paying Tribute <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>That afternoon, the Muslim Ahong recited scriptures, and representatives of Wan Fulin, Bao Yulin, Shao Wenkai, and others paid tribute. Other groups and citizens also came to pay tribute in an endless stream. Because Muslims do not value grand ceremonies, there were no various musical instruments. Those who came to pay tribute only bowed three times to the spirit. Even at six o'clock in the afternoon, there were still people coming to pay tribute, because the citizens all felt that Battalion Commander An had sacrificed himself for the country, so many braved the snow to come.</p>
<h3 id="e101">An's Brother Speaks <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to An's brother, Deming, "My (An's) brother sent his family back to his hometown during the critical period of national crisis to prepare to devote himself to the country. Afterwards, he wrote to his family, saying that the foreign insult is becoming increasingly urgent, and I am prepared to guard the land for the country and put life and death aside. All matters at home can be taken care of by the eldest brother (i.e., An Deming). At the time, I thought he was being paranoid, but I didn't expect this to happen. Now there is still an eighty-year-old mother and a brother at home, and he left behind a wife, two daughters, and a son (his wife is thirty-eight years old, the eldest daughter is thirteen years old, the second daughter is eight years old, and the youngest son is only three years old). The family has always run a small business and has no large property. Commander He gave him one hundred yuan for funeral expenses," he said. According to An's classmate, Han Shucai, "An was a student of the sixth class of the Infantry Department of the Northeast Military Academy and graduated in the summer of the sixteenth year. Later, he served as a major battalion commander of the 23rd Division of the 29th Army and adjutant general of this division. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into the 9th Independent Brigade of the Infantry, and An served as the lieutenant colonel battalion commander of the first battalion of the 626th Regiment of the brigade. This time, Battalion Commander An defended Yuguan to the death, bravely fought the enemy, took the lead, and died unexpectedly, which is a pity."</p>
<h3 id="e102">Coffin Returns to Baoding <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Because of Muslim customs, the coffin cannot be kept for a long time, so it was decided to be transported from the original site at seven o'clock on the 20th to the West Railway Station and transported to Baoding by the 22nd Pingguan train at ten o'clock in the morning. It can be buried on the 21st or 22nd. In addition to his brother An Deming, several teachers from the Qingzhen Mosque in Qinhuangdao and Han Dongcai, a representative of the Muslims in Peiping, accompanied him back to his hometown. It is reported that various groups and all members of the Muslim community in Peiping plan to hold a large-scale memorial service in Zhongshan Park in the near future. (20th)</p>
<p>Jiangbei Affected by Heavy Snow</p>
<p>Traffic Disrupted, Boats and Cars Crash, Commerce Depressed, Finance Stagnant</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Jiangbei has had continuous heavy snow for days. On the 19th, all ships and cars were suspended. Those traveling from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou could only cross the river by sailboat. After crossing the river, they could only see rickshaws struggling in the wind and snow. In the fields, the snow was several feet deep and boundless. The 28-mile car road took four hours to reach. The north wind howled, and it felt like a knife scraping the face. Snowflakes went straight into the car compartment, and the passengers' clothes and shoes were covered with an inch of snow. Their beards and eyebrows were white, and their hands and feet were stiff. Many telegraph poles along the road were broken, and telephones in Yangzhou and telegrams in Zhenjiang and Qingjiang were not working. Ice floes flowed down the canal, blocking Sanwan, and the entire river was frozen. All small ferries were suspended, and traffic on both sides of the Yangtze River was completely disrupted for a while. Vegetable fields were submerged under more than two feet of snow, and farmers could not dig them up. The city was already short of vegetarian food. Vendors could not buy or sell due to the snow, and the poorest people cried out in the streets, which was extremely miserable. Business was slow in all shops, and many money houses went bankrupt. Financial turnover was sluggish, and people's livelihoods were in distress. As the end of the old year approached, the various educational, charitable, and public welfare institutions in Yangzhou relied on the salt business to maintain their operations, amounting to five or six hundred thousand yuan, and the number of people who depended on it for a living was no less than a thousand families and ten thousand people. However, the Salt Transport Department suddenly sent personnel to the Japan Coast Public Office the day before yesterday to investigate the expenses of the past ten years. It is said that someone was dissatisfied with the public office and offered this advice to the Salt Transport Department, which wanted to know the truth, so it ordered an audit. Whether there were any abuses would be known as soon as the investigation was conducted. However, at the time of the economic closing of the lunar year, all the books were sealed up for investigation, and all appropriations for the various institutions for the end of the year were suspended, causing great pain to tens of thousands of people. It is also reported that long-distance buses and lighters in Yangzhou have had accidents and sunk. However, the snow on the bus road was cleared yesterday and should be open to traffic today.

<p>Songjiang Asks for Reduction of Arrears in Grain Tax Due to Snow</p>
<p>The grain tax is increased by two yuan per stone. Previously, the directors of the property office of this county, He Zihua, Cai Guang, and Wu Qian, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the provincial government, stating that the price of rice had fallen and the people's strength was low, requesting an exemption. The reply was received that after the flood of the year before last, finances were difficult, and the provincial treasury's revenue was not sufficient. The Ministry of Finance was requested to approve a one-year extension. As for this year's rice and grain, it is now approved for circulation, and the value is expected to increase, so the request for exemption should not be considered. Now, the directors stated that the grain tax has been increased and the burden on the people has been increased for two years, and the people are feeling pain from the extension this year. Because the above order cannot be resisted, they have to endure the pain and pay it. However, a small number of families with slightly more financial resources can pay it, while the economically weak households cannot pay it on time and are subject to late fees. The investigation of taxes and duties is an obligation that the people should fulfill, and households that pay late should be subject to penalties. However, this late fee is increased by one-tenth of the autumn quota. If it is paid after the deadline, each stone will be collected at seven yuan and nine angles, including collection fees, and within the two-yuan discount, there will be a late fee of two angles. The government has repeatedly increased the grain tax without considering the people's hardships, and this late fee is added to the burden on the people, causing dissatisfaction. The directors are deeply saddened and cannot remain silent, so they specially telegraphed for verification, urgently ordering the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance and the Songjiang Finance Bureau to deduct this late fee when calculating the two-yuan grain tax to comfort the people and appease public opinion. They are waiting for orders.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Robbery and Kidnapping Case in Lishu Township <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Eight bandits suddenly came to Sunjia Village, Lishu Township, Suzhou County, on the night of the 21st, armed with guns, broke into the house of He Genshui, wantonly searched and robbed, losing about three hundred yuan. Before leaving, they tied up Zhou's wife, Chen, and left a note demanding 5,000 yuan for ransom.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Completion of the Sujia Road Project <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction has been constructing the Suwu section (between Suzhou and Wujiang) of the Sujia Road for half a year. All earthwork has been completed early, and the pavement is now being laid. The entire project can be completed by the end of this month. The Baodai Bridge outside Fengmen has also been completed. The bridge is more than thirty feet long, and the project is quite large, being the largest bridge on the entire road.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Approval for Reduced Collection of Surveying Fees <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The County Finance Bureau received an order to levy a surveying donation of one angle per mu on the additional land price tax. After the county residents Qian Ding and others repeatedly appealed to the province for a reduction, an order was received approving a reduction of 2.5 cents, and the actual levy will be 7.5 cents per mu.</p>

<p>The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, based on the joint report of the county magistrates of Nanhui and Fengxian, Wu Xie, to the Provincial Committee, regarding the Nanhui-Fengxian boundary issue, repeatedly convened local people from the two counties to discuss and decide on five proposed solutions. Afterwards, the Nanhui side considered that the first proposal to divide the former Taiping Township into an autonomous region was not necessary in fact and argued for a long time, which was difficult to agree on. The rest were largely settled. As for Fengxian's request to divide part of Songjiang's Yexie Township and Nanhui's request to divide part of Shanghai's Chenhang Township, both were abandoned. The jointly drafted proposal was submitted for approval, and yesterday, the county magistrates of Nanhui and Fengxian, Wu Xie, and others were ordered to approve the proposal. However, regarding the first proposal to establish an autonomous region, the Nanhui County Government was ordered to re-deliberate according to law.</p>

<p>The twenty-ninth detachment of the merchant corps in Meicun Town, District 12 (Qinbo City), was headed by a certain Qiang. Four patrol officers were stationed there, one of whom, a squad leader named Chen Lixian, was from Xuzhou and around forty years old. He had married a woman last February. She was young and attractive, with a naturally flirtatious disposition. She exchanged amorous glances with a soldier from the third platoon stationed there, who was flattered and became entangled with her. Chen's wife accommodated them all, dispensing her favors equally, sharing the pleasures of spring with the third platoon soldier. Eventually, scandalous rumors spread, and Chen became aware of the affair, leading to frequent quarrels. Unexpectedly, the adulterers, emboldened by lust, plotted to murder Chen to ensure lasting peace and comfort. Yesterday, Chen's body was suddenly discovered in the reed marshes a hundred paces from the Qiang family bridge. There were no visible injuries, but blood flowed from all seven orifices. Chen's wife and the third platoon soldier had also disappeared simultaneously. Afterward, the head of the merchant corps, Qiang, led his members in a thorough search for the fugitives, but to no avail. Qiang has decided to come to the city today with Yuan Ying-san from Tuzhi to report to the county court, request an inquest, and inform the merchant guild, which will then report to the county government, urging them to order the apprehension of the fugitives.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu to Broadcast Speech Tonight</p>
<p>Aviation Association Hosted Guests from All Walks of Life Yesterday</p>
<p>The Aviation to Save the Nation Propaganda Week for all sectors of this city is scheduled to begin today. In order to promote propaganda, in addition to meetings and speeches by various groups, Mayor Wu has been specially invited to broadcast a speech at the Asia-America Radio Station at 11:00 AM today. It has been heard that Mayor Wu has another appointment at that time and has rescheduled to broadcast a speech at the Asia-America Radio Station at 7:00 PM tonight.

<h3 id="e119">Wu Chao-chu Talks About Britain's Appeasement of Japan <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Failure of Mediation is Better Than Delaying, and Urges the Chinese People to Quickly Seek Self-Salvation</p>
<p>The New Voice Society reported that Central Committee member Wu Chao-chu gave an interview to reporters yesterday, stating that Britain's recent attitude of appeasing Japan is an inevitable trend in its psychology and interests. He also advised the Chinese people to awaken, abandon their past reliance on the League of Nations, and quickly seek self-salvation. His remarks are recorded in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Britain's Appeasement of Japan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Before beginning the interview, Wu smiled and said to the reporters, "What you want to ask is no different from giving me a test." He then answered the reporters' questions, saying that Britain's recent appeasement of Japan in the League of Nations meeting was partly due to the need to deal with the issue of war debts to the United States. However, he believed that Britain's appeasement of Japan had a natural tendency. (1) As we know, although the Anglo-Japanese Alliance has been canceled, it is unprecedented for Britain to form an alliance with a certain country during peacetime. Twenty years ago, Britain was willing to form an alliance with Japan, which was due to dealing with Russia. However, another reason was that British officials and the public had a considerable emotional connection with Japan at that time. This kind of emotional effect has not been completely eliminated to this day. The British Conservative Party has this kind of psychology and is greatly influenced by it. Therefore, Britain's current defense is its main reason. Most people believe that since the Anglo-Japanese Alliance has been terminated, the close relationship between Britain and Japan has also been cut off. In fact, this is not the case. The cancellation of the alliance is only a kind of diplomatic policy. (2) Britain's relationship with the Northeast Three Provinces is not significant. The more important relationship is with other parts of China. At present, Britain does not have the power to stop violent Japan. Therefore, it has no choice but to allow Japan to carry out aggression in places that have a smaller relationship with itself, and Britain's losses are lighter. All of these are important in terms of psychology and interests.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Seek Self-Salvation Quickly <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Wu continued, "Judging from the recent mediation situation of the League of Nations on the Sino-Japanese issue, if it fails, and a report is prepared in accordance with Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant, it is difficult for us to speculate whether this report will be beneficial to our country. Whatever the League of Nations can do, it can be ignored. In general, it is better than the current situation of delay and can awaken the illusions of those who have relied on the League of Nations in the past. The only way is to seek self-salvation."</p>
<h3 id="e122">The League of Nations is Like This <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>At this point, Wu recalled his criticism of the League of Nations a year ago, saying, "The League of Nations is indeed a good international organization, but everything depends on various countries. Today, it is possible to solve the major Sino-Japanese dispute with this organization that has no money and no power? The League of Nations is just a child. Fifty years later, it will be better than today. However, it is difficult to predict whether this child will become a pillar of society or just thatch after he grows up. At present, it is just a place for propaganda and stating public reason."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Wu Will Enter Beijing <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Military Committee Chairman Jiang invited Wu to enter Beijing. Reporters asked Wu if this was true. Wu said that it was indeed true and that he would go to Beijing when necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Zhang Boling of Tianjin Telegraphed to Comfort He's Troops <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Spirits are Encouraged, Vow to Resist to the Death</p>
<p>The Nationalist Society reported that the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association had previously allocated 10,000 yuan to He Zhuguo's troops and remitted it to the Tianjin Local Association for distribution. Yesterday, the association received a telegram from Zhang Boling, chairman of the Tianjin Local Association, informing that personnel had been sent to Qinhuangdao to provide practical comfort. The entire army cheered upon hearing that Shanghai had allocated money for comfort, and they all automatically shouted to resist to the death. Their morale and military appearance were extremely strong. It is hoped that Shanghai will remit more money to encourage the loyal and brave soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Zhu Jiahua Talks <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Consolidates and Develops the Situation</p>
<p>Since arriving in Shanghai a few days ago, Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Communications and Minister of Education, was interviewed by reporters from the New Sound Society yesterday at the Cangzhou Hotel. When asked about all the problems of the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Education, he gave detailed answers as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Consolidating the Post Office <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to Zhu, the merger of the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau has already been decided, and the reorganization of the Post Office will still be carried out according to the previously announced plan. As for the reasons for the reorganization, on the one hand, due to the Northeast issue and the military actions in the bandit areas, the postal economy has suffered a great blow. Therefore, in order to maintain the domestic postal service, it was decided to immediately engage in retrenchment. All those who used to receive salaries without working will be dismissed to save money. In addition, in remote areas such as Yunnan and Xinjiang, due to inconvenient transportation, multiple transshipments, and many difficulties, and at the same time, the currency system in the border provinces is subject to decline, but the post office must still provide normal services and had to endure painful sacrifices in order to maintain transportation in the border provinces. All of these points must be reorganized and reformed in order to develop.</p>
<h3 id="e127">China Merchants Plan <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>After the China Merchants Bureau was taken back under state management, the board of directors and the general manager have been actively proceeding. First, they will eliminate accumulated malpractices and reduce staff, which is also an important plan to save money and increase practical benefits. The reorganization plan is still being drafted in detail by General Manager Liu. The funds for the reorganization may be issued in public bonds or allocated by the Ministry of Finance, but it has not been completely decided yet. Up to recently, half of the shares have been recovered, but this will end at the end of February. As for the cases of fraud by Chen Fumu and Li Guojie, they have been handed over to the court for public trial and are already a legal matter. The Ministry of Communications will no longer consult on them, but the contract with the China Business Company will definitely be canceled.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Sino-British Telecommunications <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>It is also said that the Sino-British telecommunications planned by the International Radio Station, after repeated negotiations between the Ministry of Communications and the Marconi Company, all the materials and equipment will be borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund. It is expected that the installation will be completed more than half a year later. The implementation of this communication will definitely further improve Sino-British relations.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Mackay Contract <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>As for the Mackay Contract, because China suffered too much loss from it, after it was discovered, serious negotiations were conducted and efforts were made to cancel it. However, after repeated negotiations between the Ministry of Communications and the company, because it had been formally concluded, progress was more difficult. However, the Ministry of Communications will definitely take into account our country's sovereignty and continue to negotiate in order to achieve the goal of cancellation.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Financial Unification <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>He continued that the Ministry of Finance's proposed convening of various ministries and departments to jointly discuss the issue of financial unification has been completely decided in principle. However, the implementation methods and procedures are more complicated and difficult to achieve in a short period of time. As for the position of Minister of Education, since Weng Wenhao was appointed to take over, he initially firmly declined, but after being retained by the central government, he agreed to take the position. However, due to the tension in North China, he is maintaining school affairs in Ping and has not been able to come south to take office. During this period, he can only temporarily serve as a substitute.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Present to the City Party Department <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Presenting a matter on holding a fast to aid the army on January 28th, requesting approval and immediate implementation. Tracing back to the aftermath of the Songhu Bloody Battle, the anniversary of the year is approaching. Now, the Central Branch of the 26th District of this association has written a letter stating (omitted content). According to this, the January 28th Songhu Bloody Battle is an unprecedentedly painful history. The anniversary of the week is approaching. In order to express the public's mourning and sincere heart, fasting one meal is a deep commemoration. Transferring the meal money to military spending is a beautiful and good method. There is nothing better than this. It is reasonable to report to your department, requesting permission to distribute leaflets, broadcast audio, and invite party members to give speeches in districts, print slogans, distribute them to various groups, and post them widely during the Aviation to Save the Country Propaganda Week. Immediately publish advertisements for large-scale publicity and state "Fasting to Help the Army," deposit it in the bank, and send donations on their own. Set an end date, and each should work hard to promote it, so that everyone knows it, and the results will be considerable. Sincerely hope to adopt the humble opinion and allow it to be implemented. With deep anticipation, presenting to the Shanghai Special City Party Department.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Letter to Various Groups <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Respected Sirs, According to a letter from the 26th District Branch of this association, since the fall of Shanhaiguan, people's hearts are increasingly angry. The Songhu Bloody Battle has been one year. To eradicate the strange shame and great humiliation, in addition to implementing economic severance with Japan, resistance is urgently needed. The whole depends on our arduous righteous army fighting bloody battles with Japan. However, the January 28th anniversary should have a deep expression. The so-called entertainment and other suspensions are common commemorative practices, which are not enough to be considered. Our association and others think that the pain of Songhu and the spirit of the righteous army's operations should be "fasting one meal" on January 28th, both to commemorate and to donate the meal money to military needs, or to build a January 28th fighter plane for anti-Japanese purposes. If each person is calculated at five cents, it will be a great number, which is even better than recreational salvation. Moreover, the righteous army of the Northeast is fighting in the ice and snow. Could it be that our people cannot donate one meal? The matter is easy and easy to do, and we must work hard to promote it, and the cost is limited, and the future results will be considerable. People are not made of wood and stone, and they all have patriotic hearts. Since they do not lose the slightest bit of people's possessions, what is not to be done? Correspondingly writing to your association, the spirit of saving the country, turning the tables and telling all members to advocate together and work hard to promote all members. According to this, in addition to presenting to the City Party Department for deliberation and meal sharing, correspondingly writing to your association, the spirit of saving the country, turning the tables and instructing all subordinates to advocate together and work hard to promote all members,</p>
<h3 id="e136">Ma Xiangbo's Worries About the Times <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Since the Yuyu Incident, the 94-year-old Mr. Ma Xiangbo has repeatedly expressed his worries about the times. Yesterday, he said to the New Voice Society reporter, "I (the old man referring to himself) also encountered foreign bandits during the Qing Dynasty, just like the loss of Yuyu Pass today. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, the people's corps handled Baojia, and the people began to know how to defend themselves and fight. Now, the lives and property of the people in the Yuyu Pass area are lost in unknown quantities. Why is it not seen that the newspapers report in detail? If the parents, wives, and brothers are separated in the ice and snow, the tragic situation is vividly described, then it will encourage the people's spirit and unanimously resist the violent Japan. He Zhuguo's three armies are fighting, and there will be countless more reinforcements. The people of Shanghai knew how to assist the 19th Route Army and the Songhu Self-Defense. How angry and fierce were they? Is it not enough to awaken the descendants of Jiangnan that the cannons of Yuyu Pass and the mouth of the nine gates are booming, and the only gateway fortress in North China has been occupied? Is the spring dream of January 28th still warm? At present, it is the duty of soldiers to defend the country, whether in the army or in service. This time, Mr. Duan Zhiquan clearly telegraphed, expressing 'Why is there a gap between the dynasty and the field in defending against insult?' I highly praised his move to the south. I hope that soldiers all over the country will unite from now on to deal with foreign countries. Otherwise, although the people are the masters of the Republic of China, the soldiers are derelict in their duties, and their sins are more serious than those of the violent bandits." Speaking at length, he continued to say to the reporter, "Please state on my behalf that the report the other day stated that I was a leader of Islam. I suppose that Mr. Ma Zizhen will preside over the sacrifice of Martyr An. Mr. Zizhen and I have the same name, so there are two misunderstandings. I am a student of Jingjiao, that is, a Catholic. Mr. Zizhen, I also know him well. I deeply mourn for Martyr An as a national disaster. The Catholic Church and the Fang Ritual have different memorial rituals, so it is inconvenient to invite me to preside over the sacrifice. Therefore, I guessed that it must be Mr. Zizhen who said that."</p>
<h3 id="e137">The City's Labor Community Held a Representative Congress Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>

(7) Issue a congress declaration. (8) Rename the association the Shanghai General Labor Union. Slogans were chanted immediately, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Congress Declaration: This congress is opening, almost a year since the previous one. Recalling the day the previous congress closed, we created the city-wide General Union. At that time, the September 18th Incident had just occurred, which marked the beginning of an unprecedented national crisis. This congress arose at the right time, responding to the crisis. Externally, we responded to the national crisis, united the city's workers, and served as the government's support in diplomacy and military affairs. Internally, we overcame obstacles, led existing organizations, and maintained an unyielding spirit to struggle arduously. In the past year, although we have experienced the extremes of hardship, looking at the overall situation, the national crisis has become more severe, and looking at the difficulties of the workers, unemployment has become even more serious. Asking ourselves, we cannot but feel ashamed. Now that Yuguan is in urgent need of help, Tianjin and Beijing are shaken, and the volunteer armies inside and outside the pass are fighting in the severe cold below zero degrees. Looking at the international situation, it is vastly different from the past. Postponing and watching is like revealing our lungs and liver. Japanese imperialism is instigating warlords, sharpening their knives, and pressing forward step by step, with the aim of destroying our race and exterminating our people. This is truly a time when the enemy's knife is at our throat, and we will be killed in an instant. Recalling the past, focusing on current difficulties, and looking to the future, this congress cannot help but feel pain and shed tears. However, what this congress deeply worries about is not the difficulty of the environment, but the dying of the nation and the obliteration of national consciousness. If you do not see who it is that has been jointly responding to the national crisis since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, it is those who mislead the country and protect themselves, cleverly disguise themselves, take the national crisis as a pretext, and hold the national crisis as a talisman to consolidate their territory. Those who usurp positions are eager to advocate peace and take advantage of the opportunity to seize power, using the national crisis to achieve their own goals. There are also those who take advantage of the national crisis to hoard and speculate, and treacherous people who take advantage of the national crisis to sell their reputation. Short-sighted capitalists take the opportunity to suspend operations and dismiss workers, trapping them in difficult situations. As for puppets and traitors, they are happy to see the national crisis and actively seek to achieve their goals. And there is no need to mention them further. If this is how we jointly respond to the national crisis, it is no wonder that the national crisis is increasing day by day and month by month. National crisis, oh national crisis, how much of China's territory, rights, and lives have been sacrificed in your name? Therefore, if we sincerely want to save the nation from its calamity in the future, we must work hard from top to bottom, seek truth from facts, and not allow any false steps. Commerce must be commerce, labor must be labor, agriculture must be well-cultivated, learning must be accurate, and party and government must strictly enforce discipline, guiding with norms. Each must fulfill their duties in their respective positions, and then the entire country will be orderly and unified, and there will be hope for the country. If there is temporary disturbance and each seeks his own goals, it will be more harmful than beneficial to the country. This is what this congress has sincerely and wholeheartedly hoped to awaken all the people of the country to work together. As for the many ways to save the country, they cannot be exhausted in one article. This congress must supervise and urge the executive and supervisory committee members of this session and all the workers in the city to continue the spirit of the previous session and make earnest efforts, especially in building aviation, consolidating national defense, and providing military training and aid to volunteer armies, which are considered to be the current key tasks. We hope to follow the lead of all sectors and realize them in the shortest possible time. We respectfully submit this humble statement, hoping for your clear guidance. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Ministries of Communications and Railways Plan to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief and Cancel the Method of Adding Disaster Relief Donations to Railway and Telegraph Charges <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Administrative Yuan Replies to Yizhen Association's Telegram</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Temporary Yizhen Association for Disaster Relief in the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei disaster areas previously proposed adding disaster relief donations to railway and telegraph charges to mortgage large amounts of money and distribute it for emergency relief, as the disaster areas in the three provinces were in urgent need of relief and the collection of relief funds was difficult. This proposal was reviewed and revised by the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression of Bandits in the Three Provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, and telegraphed to the Administrative Yuan and the Ministries of Communications and Railways for review and handling. The association received a reply telegram from the Administrative Yuan yesterday, which read: "Your telegram has been noted. The Commander-in-Chief of the Three Provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei has requested to add disaster relief donations to railway and telegraph charges because the recovered bandit areas are in urgent need of relief. The Yuan has carefully considered this matter. This method yields little revenue and is also complicated. The Ministries of Communications and Railways should find other ways to raise 500,000 yuan to be used for disaster relief in the bandit-stricken areas of Shaanxi and other provinces. The original plan to add disaster relief donations to railway and telegraph charges can be dismissed. This was proposed and passed by the 83rd Yuan meeting with the resolution: 'Pass. The Ministry of Railways will first issue 200,000 yuan, and the remaining 300,000 yuan will be borne by the Ministry of Railways (250,000 yuan) and the Ministry of Communications (50,000 yuan).' In addition to ordering the Ministries of Railways and Communications to comply with the fundraising and allocation, this is a special reply. (Signed) Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Administrative Yuan."</p>

<h3 id="e143">The British Boxer Indemnity Financial Committee Will Meet Today <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>To Continue Discussing the Loan to the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, due to the Ministry of Railways' loan case for the completion of the Yuehan Railway, has now received a reply and decided to convene a meeting of the committee's financial committee at No. 1 Jiujiang Road at 4:00 PM today to discuss the remaining loan of 1.2 million pounds. The committee will also continue its previous resolution to appoint Chinese Director Ye Gongchuo and Western Director Turner to attend the meeting in order to study an appropriate method and then submit it to the general meeting for discussion. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways' loan to the committee for the completion of the Yuehan Railway totals 2.4 million pounds. Among them, a portion was already approved by the general meeting on December 5th of last year and issued as public bonds worth 1.2 million gold pounds. The remaining 1.2 million pounds were not decided on at that time because the Ministry of Railways previously had a loan relationship with the British Bank Corporation, which still needed to be negotiated by the Ministry of Railways itself. Recently, the committee received a reply from the Ministry of Railways and convened the financial committee again to continue studying the remaining loan method in order to complete the entire work of the Yuehan Railway as soon as possible. It is reported that Chairman Zhu Jiahua, Vice Chairman Mazar, Chairman of the Financial Committee Hui Rongfu, and others will all participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways, also gave a talk to a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday, saying that the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee decided to expedite the completion of the Yuehan and Tongxi Railways. The ministry is actively preparing. The Tongxi Railway has already been built to Huayin and will be built to Weinan in July or August of this year. If there are sufficient funds, it can be connected to Xi'an by the end of the year. Among the Zhushao sections of the Yuehan Railway, the section from Shaoguan to Lechang will soon be open to traffic. The entire section is expected to be completed within four years. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee expressed satisfaction with the Ministry of Railways' responsible transportation operations. The ministry is determined to work hard and improve daily to facilitate commercial transportation. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee also hopes that the Ministry of Railways will expedite the construction of the two railways. The ministry believes that this matter is of great importance and has requested the Administrative Yuan to appoint representatives from the military, political, internal affairs, railways, and Shanghai municipal government departments to plan together. A meeting has been held once, and the representatives of each department have expressed their support for the Ministry of Railways' plan. The detailed method has not yet been determined. As for Mr. Wang Jingwei's recent situation, according to what I have heard, Mr. Wang is still in Europe and has not fully recovered. He was upset by the bad news from Shanhaiguan and decided to return to the country early. He will set off as soon as his health allows him to travel, but the date of departure has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received an order from the Executive Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters, forwarding the Central Government's explanation of the ambiguity of Article 19 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, and a copy of the original letter from the Central Secretariat to the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee. The original text is recorded below: "The letter from the Judicial Yuan No. 831 states, 'The Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee has submitted a request from the Licheng County Consolidation Committee to explain the ambiguity of Article 19 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. The Court has already made a unified interpretation of laws and regulations at a plenary meeting. (1) According to Article 18, Paragraph 2 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, since the standing committee members are elected by the executive committee members and appointed from among the standing committee members, the standing committee members and chairman should also be re-elected when half of the executive committee members are re-elected every two years. (2) The lottery re-election in Article 19, Paragraph 2 of the Chamber of Commerce Law is originally limited to the first time. Therefore, when the committee members who remained from the previous session are re-elected after four years, the term of office of the committee members who were elected through the re-election is only two years, and they will not be re-elected at the same time because of this. (3) Although the term of office of the committee members who were re-elected by lottery for the first time is only two years, if they are re-elected at the same time, they are considered to be re-elected as mentioned in this article.' The letter should be replied accordingly for reference." This was approved, and after the Standing Committee members approved, the order was known and the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee was informed. "It is noted that this case was previously submitted to the association by the Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, and the Court was instructed to provide an explanation. Now, it has been approved as before and approved above. In addition to the association's instructions, the original submission and the original copy are specially sent to you for your reference. Sincerely, to the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee."</p>

<p>Shensdhi News Agency's local news reports that in the past two weeks, Japanese merchant ships have transported a large batch of white sugar, amounting to 35,000 dan, to Shanghai and started to dump it on a large scale. The price is a quarter lower than the market price. General profiteering merchants have purchased it one after another, changed the Dutch brand, and transported it to the interior for sale. As a result, the price of genuine Dutch sugar has also fallen. It is investigated that the cause of the large-scale dumping of Japanese sugar at low prices is that they expect the Yuyu incident to expand, and it is heard that Sino-Russian diplomatic relations will be restored and a large batch of refined sugar from Soviet Russia will arrive in Shanghai, so they are selling at reduced prices and even transporting it to the Yangtze River area for dumping.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Wartime Relief Association's relief loan of 250,000 yuan, the first batch of 150,000 yuan, has long been borrowed out. On the 14th of this month, the second batch of 100,000 yuan was also issued together, which was transferred by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to six districts including Zhabei, Pengpu, and Yinhang. It is now known that the loan recipients are very enthusiastic, and all housing construction loans, small industrial loans, and start-up capital for the poor have started simultaneously. According to Mr. Zhang Binghui, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, this relief loan was 80% borrowed out in less than a week. After the loan is exhausted, the districts will be ordered to complete the closure.</p>

<p>Describing the Expansion of American People's Worldly Vision</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that American journalist Vincent, representing several American newspapers, has arrived in Shanghai on a tour of the Far East. It is said that the American people have broadened their scope of observation, especially regarding the world and the Far East. They seek to understand the trends and backgrounds of other nations. At present, the nations of the East and West are becoming increasingly close, but the biggest obstacle to goodwill lies in the often unclear understanding of each other's backgrounds. What newspapers record is usually news about wars, accidents, or extraordinary events. Seldom are the true lives, customs, and thoughts of the people revealed. Therefore, the editors of the newspapers he represents deeply believe that there is a vast range of narratives about the people of this region that can be gathered and contributed to the readers. Thus, he has come to China to investigate the trends of the Chinese national economy and politics, and the facts that sufficiently shape the internal conditions and background of future national thought.</p>
<h3 id="e152">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Laid-Off Workers Petition Today <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Labor Union Denies Workers Forming a Hunger Strike Group</p>
<p>Following the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's continued layoff of 101 workers from five wharves, the laid-off workers petitioned the board of directors, demanding complete reinstatement. Yesterday, they held another general meeting and decided to go to the company at 9:00 AM today to present their petition. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Continued General Meeting: The Five Wharf Workers' Union held a general meeting of laid-off workers at 4:00 PM yesterday. Executive Director Chen Shi was elected chairman to report on the progress of the petition. Then, discussions began, and it was resolved that: (1) At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, all will go to the board of directors to submit the laid-off workers' petition. (2) A full reinstatement is demanded. If there is no satisfactory reply, no one will leave until 6:00 PM. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>Union Statement: Executive Director Chen Shi of the union issued a statement saying that the reports in the newspapers on the 22nd about the laid-off workers having divergent opinions and forming a hunger strike group were completely untrue. The company's layoff aims to save money, but the savings are only a little over 3,000 yuan per month, while over 100 people have been laid off. Who is responsible for the displacement and suffering of the families of these 100 people? The company is not thinking fundamentally and absolutely does not consider abolishing the exploitative comprador system, allowing them to ride in cars, live in Western houses, and place their relatives. Even if a thousand yuan is saved, it cannot compensate for the loss of ten thousand yuan per month. It is even more heartbreaking that the real redundant staff have not been laid off. Therefore, it was decided to submit a petition today requesting the board of directors to make corrections.</p>

<p>| Increased Postage to be Implemented Next Month |</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Peiping air route of the China National Aviation Corporation originally passed through Nanking, Haichow, Tsingtao, Tientsin, and then to Peiping. The company, due to shorter daylight hours in winter, found that flying from Shanghai to Peiping with multiple stops would make it impossible to reach Peiping on time. Therefore, when the route took off for the second time, it only briefly stopped at Haichow, Tsingtao, and Tientsin, flying directly to Peiping without turning to Nanking to save time. This was reported to the Ministry of Communications. However, as the number of mails sent from Shanghai-Hankow to Peiping and Tientsin is increasing daily, to facilitate transportation, it has been decided that starting from the third flight, the original Nanking station air route will be restored. As for the issue of increased postage for airmail, it has been approved by the Executive Yuan, with an increase of ten cents per postal zone (i.e., a total of twenty-five cents), which is scheduled to be implemented starting next month.</p>

<p>| One Thief on North Fukien Road Shot and Arrested |</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:30 PM, a robbery occurred in Tai An Li on North Shansi Road. Afterwards, detectives captured a thief on Fukien Road. Both sides exchanged fire and accidentally injured a passerby. The findings of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e155">Six Thieves Arrive Suddenly <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>No. 35 Tai An Li is a three-story building. The eastern wing downstairs is the Li Tai Kee Construction Company. The eastern wing upstairs is occupied by the family members of the factory owner. The western wing downstairs is the Hsieh Hsing Metal Company, which is run by Yu Hsing-tsai from Ningpo. His family members live in the western wing upstairs. The middle of the hall upstairs is rented by Hsu Chi-liang, who works at the Tung Yi Company, and his family. At about 5:30 PM yesterday, six thieves suddenly came to the company. Three thieves entered through the front door, and the rest entered through the back door, leaving two thieves to stand guard at the front and back doors. The four thieves then each held a handgun and rushed into the east and west wings.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Simultaneous Search and Robbery in Both Wings <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>When the thieves rushed into the Li Tai Kee Construction Company in the east wing, they immediately forbade everyone from making noise and ordered them to hand over everything they had. However, none of the friends had anything to offer. The thieves then searched their persons. At that time, the factory owner's wife happened to be in the wing and was robbed of two emerald rings, one ruby ring, two jade bracelets, and more than ten yuan in paper money. At the same time, the other thieves broke into the Hsieh Hsing Metal Company in the west wing and searched and robbed in the same way. In total, they robbed 395 silver dollars, 100 small coins, more than ten yuan in paper money, and rings, etc. Seeing that they had searched and robbed everything, the thieves called to each other and drove the people in both wings into the rear room of the east wing and locked them up, assigning one thief to guard them.</p>

<p>At this time, Li Chi-liang's wife in the hall upstairs heard footsteps downstairs and went downstairs to take a look. Before she could reach the middle of the staircase, she was spotted by the thieves and forced downstairs. The thieves demanded money from her. She took out 15 yuan in paper money from her pocket. However, Mrs. Li still had valuable watches and diamond rings on her right hand, which fortunately were not noticed by the thieves. Mrs. Li quickly sat down in a hidden place in the hall and secretly took off the diamond ring and put it away, thus avoiding being robbed. Seeing Mrs. Li sitting down, the thieves swarmed upstairs and first entered the hall upstairs to open boxes and chests, but found nothing. Finally, seeing that the drawers on the redwood dressing table were locked, the thieves planned to pry them open. Just then, the owner of Li Tai Kee in the east wing walked out of the room.

<p>The owner of Li Tai Kee, having closed the door tightly, then pushed open the window and blew the police whistle wildly. The thieves upstairs and downstairs heard this and hurriedly ran out. Two thieves escaped through the front door, firing several shots into the sky to show their strength. The two thieves guarding the front and back doors also fled afterwards. Two thieves, fearing that something was wrong due to the gunshots at the front door, changed course and escaped through the back door. At this time, the people who had been imprisoned by the perpetrators also broke out and chased after them, shouting "Catch the robbers" and pursuing closely. Seeing that they were being chased closely, the two thieves ran through three alleys and across the Old Zha Bridge. It happened that Western detectives No. 50 and Nos. 2371, 2479, from the Division were patrolling the area. Seeing this, they went forward to arrest them.</p>

<p>When the detectives chased to the front of the Shanghai Telephone Company on Fukien Road, they were still more than ten yards away from the two thieves. In desperation, the two thieves turned around and fired at the detectives. The detectives returned fire. Bullets flew everywhere, and pedestrians rushed to avoid them. One thief was wounded and fell to the ground and was captured on the spot. A pistol was also seized. One thief escaped in the chaos. At the same time, a person named Ren Ting, from Shaoshing, 17 years old, and an electrician, was hit in the right arm by a stray bullet. He was taken to the Tongren Hospital by the detectives for treatment. The wounded thief and pistol were taken to the police station. Under strict interrogation, he confessed that his name was Chang A-fu, from Kiangyin, 19 years old, and formerly a blacksmith. Before the robbery, someone instigated him and discussed it in room 311 of the Antung Hotel on Hupeh Road. After obtaining the confession, the police dispatched detectives to search everywhere and sent the wounded thief to Tongren Hospital. He had one gunshot wound in his right leg and one in his left waist, with the bullet still in his waist. His life is in danger.</p>

<p>Gasoline Market to Have Unprecedented Price Drop</p>
<p>The Ta Lu Pao reports that the local gasoline market will have an unprecedented price drop and competition. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, starting from New Year's Day this year, customs has allowed Soviet ships to fly the Russian flag into port. Previously, Russian kerosene had to be transported to Shanghai on British and German tankers. In the future, it can be loaded on Russian tankers and sailed directly to Shanghai from the Black Sea coast, with one ship arriving in Shanghai approximately every two months, each ship carrying 6 to 8 million gallons of oil. With the abundant supply of Russian oil, the Kwang Hua Company, which distributes it, is also greatly expanding its oil storage facilities in Shanghai and Pudong, adding oil tanks, warehouses, and pumps, etc., and will increase its capital from 1.5 million yuan to 3 million yuan next month. At the same time, it has huge sales plans for gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil, etc. It is said that its selling price, no matter how other companies compete, will ultimately be five cents per gallon cheaper than the common market price. Therefore, most car owners are looking forward to the realization of this unprecedented price drop competition. The Wusung Steamer Case: Negotiations Association to be Established Today</p>
<p>Yu Chia-ching Scheduled to Negotiate with Company Today</p>
<p>In the case of the Jardine Matheson steamer Wusung expelling Chinese deck passengers, the negotiations association of fellow sufferers, jointly formed by the comprador and workers, is scheduled to be established at the city party headquarters at 2:00 PM today. Yu Chia-ching, Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is scheduled to negotiate with the company today to resolve the issue. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Waiting for Negotiations: The Hankow sailors requested that the Hankow Municipal Government arrest the two compradors Tung Chun-hua and the bookkeeper Hu Ho-nien and escort them to Shanghai. After the China Maritime Mutual Aid Association petitioned for their release, a reporter from the New Sound Society met with members of the Chinese deck passenger office yesterday. According to them, in the Wusung steamer case, the comprador colluded with the company to oppress the workers and undermine the labor movement. Tung and Hu, who were arrested by the Hankow Municipal Government and sent to Shanghai for punishment, have now been bailed out. Upon hearing this, all the workers questioned the labor union and were very indignant. Now, after a meeting, it has been decided to petition the government again, demanding that they still be severely punished. As for the Wusung steamer fellow sufferers negotiations association established under the leadership of the party and government, it failed to meet the day before yesterday because the company side was late. The company's delay is very obvious. In short, this association is waiting for the results of the conference of the negotiations association and Chinese director Yu Chia-ching tomorrow (i.e., today) and the negotiations with the company, before deciding on a course of action.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Instruction: The Preparatory Committee of the Special Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Party instructed the Maritime Mutual Aid Association as follows: "Regarding the instruction matter, it is found that disputes often arise among Chinese deck passengers on Jianghai steamers due to poor systems, which affect shipping and the future is not optimistic. In order to develop shipping and improve the lives of workers, taking both into consideration, the 9th committee meeting of this association decided that the Maritime Mutual Aid Association should submit a report on the current situation of the Chinese deck passengers, the causes of the long-standing abuses, and improvement measures to the meeting for review and recording. It is ordered that the association immediately comply with this and report for review and decision. Respectfully ordered." The Mutual Aid Association then forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Maritime Association, saying: "Respectfully, we have received an instruction from the Special Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Party, regarding the instruction matter (omitted). Upon receiving this, we find that improving the tearoom system of the shipping industry is of great importance to the interests of shipping passengers. In addition to sending a separate letter to our members, setting a deadline for reporting, in order to compile and forward it, we respectfully request you to inform your members for reference and handling, and hope that your association will jointly promote progress to achieve perfection and benefit the business. We await your reply with public gratitude."</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports that, according to Chinese newspapers in Shanghai, the Canton gunboat "Ching Tung" was heading towards Nan Ao Island at night and was seen by a Chao Hai Customs patrol boat, which suspected it of smuggling and chased after it, firing. The commander of the gunboat, believing that the patrol boat was a pirate ship, did not identify himself and returned fire. After exchanging fire for some time, the gunboat was hit and sank, drowning about ten people. It is reported that the captain of the Customs patrol boat has been detained pending investigation. The North China Daily News representative inquired at the Shanghai Chief Customs Office. According to the spokesperson, although the case occurred on Thursday night, the Customs only learned of it from the Chinese newspapers and has telegraphed Shantou to verify this news, but has not yet received a reply. Inquiries were also made at the coastal anti-smuggling office, which replied that this news may not be true, as Customs patrol boats are not armored and are only equipped with three-pound guns. The Shanghai Office of the Naval Department also stated that it had not received this news, as the "Ching Tung" was owned by the Kwangtung Provincial Government and not under the jurisdiction of the Naval Department.</p>
<h3 id="e164">County Government Actively Building Granaries for Grain Storage <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>| Food Management Committees Have Been Established in All Districts |</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, due to repeated instructions from the Kiangsu Civil Affairs Department to build granaries for grain storage, specially planned to raise funds and submitted them to the County Food Committee. It was decided to purchase five mu of land in the new county seat to build warehouses and store grain worth eight thousand yuan. Now that grain storage for famine preparedness is a matter of great importance, the preparatory members are actively planning construction these days and will complete it in the shortest possible time. The original grain storage funds of Shanghai County were jointly owned and managed by the city government. A proposal for division has not yet been implemented. The total amount of these grain storage funds is 143,051 yuan, 98 cents, and 2 li in cash, 23 mu, 2 fen, 7 li, and 1 hao in warehouse land, and 109 houses. The current cash portion was diverted by the former military governor Ho, totaling</p>
<p>107,275 yuan and 40 cents. 1,002 yuan, 22 cents, 3 fen and 1 li by former Magistrate Shen. 4,760 yuan by the city land bureau. There is still 30,013 yuan, 85 cents and 1 li remaining. It is now heard that the county government has submitted a request to the provincial government to transfer it to the city government for prompt division to avoid further delays.</p>
<p>In addition, the Food Management Committees in each district of the county were previously required by the county government to prepare for establishment within a time limit. After receiving the order, the district chiefs in the six districts of the county complied and organized and established them one after another. They have all submitted a list of committee members and the establishment situation to the county, and the county magistrate Yen issued an order for the departments to record and verify. Yesterday, another instruction was issued to each management committee to report on the work situation on a monthly basis for reference and investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Bandits Commit All Kinds of Evil, Cleverly Using the "Stealing the Sky and Swapping the Sun" Scheme <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Gluing White Paper on Envelopes is a Very Clever Scheme, Using Postmarks to Commit Evil is an Innovative Approach</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a type of bandit who specializes in impersonating investigators of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Drug Enforcement Department to scare residents and swindle money. Their technique is very clever and not easy to detect. For example, if they want to extort money from someone, they write a letter reporting that the person has opium paraphernalia or smokes opium in private, and on the front of the envelope, they write the name and address of their accomplice and mail it. After receiving the letter, the accomplice removes the paper glued to the envelope, leaving a blank envelope. Then, they fill in "To Mr. So-and-so, Investigator of the Drug Enforcement Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council." The back of the envelope has already been stamped by the post office. These people then use this letter to claim to those they want to scare that someone has reported them for smoking opium, so they have come to search. When speaking, they show the letter with the postmark. If the person does have an opium addiction or has opium paraphernalia, seeing the letter with the postmark, they will not suspect that it is fake. These people then take the opportunity to extort money, and they are successful almost every time, rarely being exposed. Recently, Hsu Chien-chuan, Hsu Chang-lin, and Hsu's wife Chu, who live at No. 563 Parker Road, also encountered six or seven of these bandits who broke into their home. After finding a smoking pipe, they began to negotiate. Then, Chang Shun-chang, an accomplice of the bandits, arrived uninvited and pretended to mediate, saying that they were all friends and could settle privately. He then extorted 20 yuan in paper money and gave it to the bandits posing as investigators. After they left, Hsu and others initially did not know the inside story and were extremely grateful to Chang, and compensated him with 20 yuan. Later, Chen Yao-ting, an investigator of the Drug Enforcement Department, found out about this and inquired about the whereabouts of the bandits from Hsu Chien-chuan and others. He then went to No. 137 Hsin Zha Road and arrested Chang Shun-chang, and then went to Room 20, Aido Hotel, Aido Road and arrested three accomplices, Hsu Yuan-kuei, Lu Rong-kuei, and Wu Shih-ching, and confiscated fake letters and other items. The day before yesterday, they were escorted to the First Special District District Court, where Judge Chien Wen-chi examined them. Wang Yao-tang, the police lawyer, said that the case committed by the defendants was probably not just once and requested a postponement for detailed investigation. Judge Chien then ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and postponed the trial.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Inland River Ships Delayed by Snow Resume Service Yesterday <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Police Strictly Crack Down on Soochow Creek Ruffians, Temporarily Suspending All But Through Tickets</p>
<p>The Kiangsu and Chekiang inland river ships, which had been delayed and suspended due to the cold weather, heavy snow, and frozen waterways, have now completely resumed service since yesterday after the weather cleared and the shipping companies took measures to break the ice. In addition, the Public Concession Police has also taken action to crack down on the ruffians in the Soochow Creek area. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Service Resumed After Weather Clears: The Shanghai-Soochow service of China Merchants Yuan Tung Inland River Small Steamers, the Changshu-Hangchow service of Yuan Tung, the Shanghai-Changshu service of Lao Kung Mao Hsieh Hsing Tai, the Soochow-Changshu service of Lao Kung Mao, the Chingyangkiang-Changshu service of China Merchants, the Soochow-Huchow service of Transportation, the Wusih-Liyang-Kiangyin service of China Merchants Chunghua, and the Changshu-Taitsang service of China Merchants, which had been temporarily suspended due to heavy snow and frozen waterways, causing inconvenience to passengers, have completely resumed service since yesterday after the weather cleared and the companies hired workers to break the ice. The Shanghai-Huchow service of China Merchants Yuan Tung Cheng Chang Li Hsing Li Hsing Yung Shun Yung An, the Shanghai-Pinghu service of Ping Hu Min Nan, the Shanghai-Tsingpu service of Yu Ching, the Shanghai-Changyen service of Shen Chang Hu Chang, and the Shanghai-Sheng Tse service of Ning Shao, which had been running slower and frequently delayed due to the weather, have also returned to normal after the weather cleared.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Ruffians: The wharves along the Soochow Creek are where inland river ships dock. Considering that the ruffians extort money and affect the safety of passengers when the ships arrive, the Lake Society sent a letter to the Inland River Shipping Association, requesting that it take measures to rectify the situation. The association then requested the Public Concession Police to take effective action, which the police verified to be true and ordered the Old Zha and Hueisi police stations to handle it. Since it was implemented last month, with Chinese detectives stationed at each wharf to arrest and send ruffians to the police, ruffians who specialize in extortion have disappeared.</p>
<p>Suspension for Closing Accounts: A reporter from the New Sound Society met with a director of the Inland River Shipping Association yesterday. According to him, the 25th of this month (i.e., the end of the lunar year) is the closing date for the 21st year of various industries. The shipping companies are busy closing accounts, and according to the old practice of previous years, all Jiangsu and Chekiang inland river ships, except those with through-ticket connections with the Shanghai-Nanking and Shanghai-Hangchow Railway passenger trains, will be temporarily suspended from the 24th of this month and will gradually resume service from the 28th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Great Harmony Music Society recently decided to participate in the Chicago World's Fair in the United States in response to a request from the preparatory office. It was originally planned to transport all 180 kinds of musical instruments it had made to the United States for competition. However, at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Academy last Sunday, it was pointed out that transporting the instruments to the United States would be a long and inconvenient journey. Moreover, without members accompanying them to perform, it would be like antiques, which would be boring. Therefore, it was decided to use films and photos of musical instruments for projection and display, which would be more meaningful. The Society then convened a meeting of all members of the Great Orchestra last Sunday afternoon to discuss the preparation methods. The organization was divided into five departments to actively proceed. The Society also adopted a large-scale plan to represent the nature of ancient and modern Chinese music. The program is divided into two categories: (A) Instrumental music (court music, banquet music, chamber music, Buddhist music, Taoist music); (B) Vocal music (folk music, Kunqu opera, Wu songs, southern tunes, northern tunes). The society will invite famous groups and experts from both local and out-of-town areas. Those who are not acquainted only need to judge themselves to have considerable talent and can join on their own. The society welcomes all of them. All office staff have been assigned and are responsible for their respective duties. It is scheduled to officially start work next Monday. This is the first time that Chinese music has been seen by the world, which is of great importance to the inherent culture. It is heard that the members of the society are all working hard.</p>

<p>The She County Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, because the provincial highway from She County to Yuling in Chekiang Province will soon begin construction, and the original pedestrian roads are all paved with high-quality bluestone, which is convenient for pedestrians, but it is a pity to destroy it.

<p>On the railway side of Shanghai West Zhongshan Road, at about 9:30 PM the night before last, a certain car suddenly stopped by the roadside for about an hour. Then, three gunshots were heard, followed by cries for help. Local villagers heard the gunshots but dared not venture out to investigate in the dark. Only after the car drove away did they dare to go and check, but found nothing unusual. The relevant Public Security Bureau is now conducting a rigorous investigation to determine what happened.</p>

<p>The Zhang family, whose daughter was kidnapped by bandits on the night of September 28th, 1928, at the entrance of No. 1928 Tongfu Road, later paid a ransom for her release. Subsequently, the police arrested a bandit named Li Zhangfu, who was sent to the First Special Court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Now, Li suddenly confessed that a person named Jin Jilin was also an accomplice. Zhao Fuhai, Cui Chengke, and Bao Tan Ma Derong, detectives from the Xinzha Police Station, investigated and found that Jin Jilin was actually Xu Detang (also known as Little Suzhou). They arrested Xu on the 22nd of last month at No. 14 Yile Lane, Fuxu Road, and sent him to the First Special Court. Li Zhangfu pointed out that Xu Detang was an alias of Jin Jilin and that he had met Xu twice in the bandit's hideout. However, Xu completely denied this, saying that the detective who arrested Li Zhangfu was Liang Chengyu, the No. 2 Chinese detective who is now a convicted criminal. Liang framed him to settle an old score because he did not know Li's whereabouts and Xu had led the arrest. The court was welcome to call Liang as a witness. He also hired lawyer Ye Fikang to defend him. Subsequently, the court ordered Liang to be brought in. Liang testified that it was indeed Xu who had led the arrest, and Xu was present when Li was arrested. Li did not say that Xu was an accomplice; otherwise, the police would have detained him. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the testimony and declared Xu Detang not guilty. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, requested that Xu be remanded in custody during the appeal period, which the court granted.</p>

<p>丨Illegal Acts of Police Detectives丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou railway stations have detectives search passengers. Originally, the Second District Police Station sent Gao to be stationed at the Shanghai station to execute. Later, the Public Security Bureau, considering the search matters to be important, added a supervisor to oversee. However, recently, the Investigation Team has also sent detectives to be stationed at the station for independent searches. The other day, a detective named Liu Shaoqing, along with his partner Du Jinlou, searched a passenger named Pan Shourong, suspected of carrying opium. Du Jinlou took advantage of the situation to seize thirty yuan of Pan's money, hiding it in his trouser leg. Pan Shourong discovered this, seized him and handed him over. Liu Shaoqing found the banknotes on his partner. When the station police chief arrived, he took both detectives to the Gaochang Temple Police Station. The patrolmen then submitted a report to the Second District, requesting that it be forwarded to the Public Security Bureau for disciplinary action, and handed over the two detectives. District Chief Jin Tian then submitted the case to the Bureau. After investigation by the Third Section, Du Jinlou was identified as impersonating a detective and was ordered to be sent to the Local Court for prosecution according to the law.</p>

<p>丨Letter from Mr. Wu Qianxing丨</p>
<p>I am from Jinxi, Jiangxi. In October of this year, my home was occupied by the Red Army. I had no choice but to escape and seek a livelihood elsewhere. I originally planned to go to my cousin's place in Jinshi, Hunan, to find a position, but after arriving in Jinshi, I searched everywhere without success. My travel expenses were also exhausted. Being a stranger in a strange land, with no relatives or friends to turn to, I had to pawn all my belongings and become a peddler with a carrying pole. Unexpectedly, after less than three days, some idle thugs stole all my coppers and my carrying baskets in the evening, leaving me with no way up or down! My fate is so unfortunate; who could be worse off than me? Now, as a temporary measure, I want to help others as a hired hand, but no one will introduce me; I want to do hard labor, but I lack the strength to even bind a chicken, and my eyesight is not good. I want to beg from door to door, but I fear being met with scorn. A young man like me is reluctant to resort to such a last resort. Therefore, I am writing to you, hoping you can quickly provide guidance for my lost path. I would be extremely grateful!</p>
<p>Reply: After reading your letter, I cannot help but sigh! Speaking of which, your personal problem is very simple. Just get everyone to pool a few dozen dollars to give you a small business; or recommend a job for you, and it will be over. But your life is only a reflection of one drop in the ocean of the current decline of Chinese society; solving your personal problem, however, cannot solve the social problem that produced your life, the so-called "When shall I see a mansion of a million rooms, sheltering all the impoverished scholars of the world, and making them rejoice?" Not only is it impossible to do so, even if it is done, it is only a "treat the head when it hurts, treat the foot when it hurts" approach. Moreover, the duty of a newspaper, narrowed down, that is, the duty of the "Reader's Advisor" reporter, lies only in: (1) Pointing out the reader's difficulties in personal life problems: (2) Providing theoretical opinions on social problems: (3) From the standpoint of the greatest number of people, link the solution of the reader's personal life problems with the solution of the entire social life problem, and do not only see the trees and not see the forest. However, you still have a way to live, which is "doing hard labor". From your letter, you only said that you "lack the strength to even bind a chicken" and that your "eyesight is not good," and you did not say that there is no hard labor to do. The so-called hard labor is also of different levels. Some hard labor is naturally not suitable for people with weak physical strength, while others do not require much strength. If you have hard labor to do, then do hard labor. Because you have reached the end of the road, if you don't do hard labor, you can only die; that's right, there is another way: to be a thief; but being a thief can lead to imprisonment, or even execution, which also results in death. Between two evils, choose the lesser one. Doing hard labor can still save your life. You are young, and although the future of society seems dark, it has already revealed some light. Everyone is working hard to move forward, and one day it will completely become a society of hard labor, and then hard labor will be happy labor.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Re-answering Mr. Wang Xiping on the "Law of Panic Cycle" Problem <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>I have two points in response to Mr. Wang's letter published in this column on the 21st of this month. First, I said that Mr. Wang's wording was quite unclear because the editor and I mentioned that that passage was not easy to understand. After reading it, I felt that Mr. Wang's original text was indeed written a bit hastily, and some of the characters were not easy to recognize clearly. At the same time, the wording in it, such as "The statistics of import and export are realized, that is, the accumulation of production capital and commodity capital has a standard", is indeed somewhat difficult to understand. I strongly advocate that the wording published in newspapers be simple and easy to understand, so that the general readers can understand it, so I advocate asking Mr. Wang to organize it. Second, the tools of economics are already sufficient. The responsibility of us later students is to choose appropriate theoretical tools and apply them to the current facts. I am determined not to be as bold as the old Mr. Xu Qingfu in doing revolutionary and inventive work in economics. What is hateful right now are the bourgeois economists, that is, the current orthodox school, still deceiving themselves with outdated theories. So I feel that some correct theories should be instilled into the general readers. Everything I said in my writing is just applying existing tools to explain the facts at hand, and there is no newly invented theory. Speaking of the law of panic cycle, scholars in the 18th century had already gained some concepts. In the early 19th century, the merry-go-round-style law of panic cycle was highly advocated. But the spiral-style law of panic cycle was not invented until the end of the 19th century. But the current orthodox school is still applying the merry-go-round-style law of panic cycle from the early 19th century, so I want to correct it. The word "we" in my writing naturally refers to "our school", not to me personally.</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Problem of "Rationalization of Production" and "How to Struggle" <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Zhu Ying丨</p>
<p>I have participated in the discussion of Mr. Weng Chongshi's question several times before and after. On the first day of this month, Mr. Shen Yimin gave some explanations to my so-called "rationalization of production", and I wanted to write a letter to answer. But because of the inconvenience of things, it was put on hold. Today I read Mr. Weng's letter again, and he wants to discuss directly with us. So I wrote this letter in the falling snow, enduring the bitter cold, to make separate replies.</p>
<p>First, I am replying to Mr. Shen. Of course, most of everything Mr. Shen explained is correct, but my so-called "As a result of the rationalization of production, you are exhausted all day long and cannot get enough to eat," there is nothing wrong with this sentence, and it does not conflict with what Mr. Shen explained, why? Mr. Shen explained that it is difficult to have four points, but the content is only to produce a large number of raw products with extremely little labor time and material energy. Do you know whether a worker has enough time under these conditions? Is it necessary to increase the speed of the machine and increase the intensity of the work? On the other hand, the faster the production speed, the more excessive the raw products, which leads to economic panic, and the capitalist's method of relief is to close factories, lay off workers, reduce wages, etc... From this point of view, "As a result of the rationalization of production, you are exhausted all day long and cannot get enough to eat." This sentence can be established. Naturally, the result of "rationalization of production" is not only this. But taking out a part of its results, logically, it does not violate any rules. As for "I am afraid that Mr. Zhu will also hate and oppose the rationalization of production in the current society and the rationalization of production in the future rational society," the basis for Mr. Shen's words is "The planned economy of the Soviet Union also reveals this clue," in other words: The economic organization of the Soviet Union is also implementing "rationalization of production." Regardless of whether this term seems to have not been heard in the Soviet Union, even if it is called "rationalization of production" in the future, the freedom and equality of capitalism are completely different from the freedom and equality of socialism. So we are now proposing "rationalization of production," there is no doubt that it refers to the economic organization of capitalism. Secondly, what I want to say to the reporter is: "Mr. Zhu is sick,..." and I don't have time to do a calm and precise analysis," or the reporter means to protect my shortcomings, I am of course grateful, but in fact I am not sick, no. I have never been sick, even in the "oppression of the capitalists". Attached with a smile.</p>
<p>Second: Reply to Mr. Weng. The reporter has answered Mr. Weng's letter in great detail. Now I want to say one more thing here, which is: 1. Choose a goal. The reporter said: "As long as you can know the source of your suffering, you can get it," this sentence is worthy of our appreciation. We must know who is giving us pain in the current society, and we must overthrow him. Who is giving us happiness, we must support him: look at which part of the world is a painful society, which part is a happy society, and it is not difficult to infer, and we must know that there is a kind of person among the two who is deceiving us with improved methods, and we must not follow them, and in fact, it has been proved that these people are often on the opposite side of us. 2. Establish a foothold. In the process of a person's struggle in society, not only can he not be understood by the general public, but even his closest relatives, sons, brothers, wives, etc., cannot be understood. Here, we can see a person's personality. Some people may be able to jump out of this environment, and some people will fall with them. It is best if we can learn from Liu Ling's drinking. His wife persuaded him to quit drinking. He agreed verbally, but in fact, he tricked him into drinking wildly once again. It is still five斗one石 to not listen to "women's words" (of course, educated women are excluded). Like the views of Mr. Weng's wife, it is naturally not surprising; but Mr. Weng should not only be influenced by her at this time, but should also insist on his own "Three Commandments", no, when he moves from a passive personal cultivation to a positive social reform in the future, his wife may interfere even more, then Mr. Weng should fight her even more. 3. Believe in yourself. As long as you have the right goal, as long as your position is firm, then you must believe in yourself. Because there are some people who see a great cause, especially a cause of reforming society, and feel that they are too small to achieve it. In fact, I am a member of society. I do my part, and others do their part. When combined, they become a great force. At the same time, with my firm struggle, I can influence others' firm struggle. "A nine-story platform starts with a pile of earth." As long as we do it bit by bit, the bright world can be achieved by people who others see as worthless today.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Weng wants us to tell him our mailing address. Since the reporter has introduced us, we may communicate with him directly in the future, or communicate through this newspaper. It is best to communicate through this newspaper, because firstly, our personal problems are everyone's problems, and secondly, getting the reporter to participate in the discussion will be of great help to us, and I think the reporter will agree.</p>

<p>丨Five Unrelated Persons Released丨</p>
<p>Di Si Road Police Station's Second Chinese Constable Mao Yiwen and Assistant Yang Xiguang previously arrested nine bandits, including Lu Yunxiang, Ji Jin, Sun Huilin, and Chen Liyou from Jiangbei, as well as five suspects, including Ren Qigui. They seized a pistol and six bullets and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Linyu continued to handle the case in the Criminal Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that during the adjournment, it was found that Lu Xuexiang, Ji Sheng, and Sun Huilin had committed three cases of armed robbery with guns between February of last year and January of this year, robbing Zhou Xihua's tobacco and paper shop at No. 813 Zhaojiabang Road, Wang Laisheng's shop at No. 687, and robbing pedestrian Wang Zhengfu of clothes and property on Qiwupu Road. Lu Liyou was charged with illegally carrying a pistol, which was found in his clothes. The other five persons, Ren Qigui, Xu Xiao'erzi, Zhang Huolou, Jia Xiang, and Cai Xingxiang, were unrelated and should be released. Subsequently, the victims testified about the robbery at the time, which was compared to the statements of the four defendants, Lu and others. The answers were vague. Judge Zhao ordered them to be remanded in custody and sentenced on the scheduled date. Ren Qigui, Xu Xiao'erzi, Zhang Huolou, Jia Xiang, and Cai Xingxiang were granted release.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Widow Sentenced for Abusing Adopted Daughter <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Xue Liu, a widow from Yixing residing at No. 5 Yuanyuli, Songpan Road, has an adopted daughter, Xiao Shunying, aged 14. Due to repeated abuse and beatings by Mrs. Xue, Xiao Shunying was covered in bruises. On the 8th of this month, Mrs. Xue again severely beat the girl to the ground under the pretext of a certain reason. The neighbors reported this to Chinese Constable No. 1935 on duty nearby, who arrested Xue Liu and took her to the Yangshupu Police Station. Xiao Shunying was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Xue Liu was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Later, after Xiao Shunying's injuries had healed slightly, she was brought to court and questioned about the daily summer lashings she suffered. The court found that the injuries were indeed true,辩论 was concluded, and a sentencing date was set. Xiao Shunying was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan and Public Prosecutor Wang Zuze from the Criminal Court sentenced Xue Liu to three months in prison. The number of days in custody before the trial was determined to be offset against the prison term at a rate of two days for one day. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Xiao Shunying was now homeless and should still be sent to the Jiliang Institute for care, so that she could study, learn skills, and be arranged for marriage by the Institute in the future. The court approved this.</p>

<p>Since the Great Shanghai Consumer Cooperative started business at No. 118 Luban Road, French Concession on the 15th of this month, the business has been very prosperous.

The members of the Cooperative and residents in the neighborhood all flock to buy. Now, they are also selling cooking oil and other items, which is even more convenient for members. It is said that in order to reduce consumer costs for the general public, the Cooperative is publicly recruiting members again.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Chaozhou Fellow-Villagers Association Requests Careful Discussion to Resolve the Method of Sealing Enemy Goods <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Chaozhou sojourning-in-Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association, in light of the 9/18 Incident and the subsequent sealing of enemy goods in Shantou, valued at over ten million silver dollars, for which no proper resolution has been determined, leading to impacts on finance and endangering the social economy, yesterday specifically sent letters to the Shantou City Party Department, the Municipal Government, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. The letter stated: "Japanese invaders are running rampant, occupying our northeastern territory. The nation is engaging in economic severance with them, hence the act of sealing enemy goods. However, while the goods originate from an enemy country, the capital comes from numerous merchants. If we merely engage in sealing without seeking appropriate resolutions, the losses will not be limited to merchants alone, but will also impact the social economy. Therefore, various places in Shanghai and Guangdong have all established methods. While these methods differ, they all aim to eliminate the root causes without hindering the economy as the standard. We hear that since 9/18, Shantou has sealed enemy goods valued at over ten million yuan, but due to differing opinions, a method of disposal has been long delayed. Many businesses are implicated and going bankrupt, and the market is also panicking as a result. Furthermore, in recent years, over 300,000 overseas Chinese merchants from Chaozhou and Shantou, who have lost their jobs due to real estate and industry issues, have returned to their hometowns, reducing remittances by over 30 million yuan. Finance is stagnant, the market is depressed, and banditry is rampant, with no end in sight to the subsequent disasters. Therefore, we specifically send this letter, requesting investigation and hoping that you will immediately convene meetings of all sectors, with the main objectives of relieving losses and preventing drift. Regarding the sealed enemy goods, investigate and clarify the dates of import before 9/18, after 9/18, and after 1/28, and discuss appropriate sales methods separately so that the goods are not left to rot and finance can circulate, both to alleviate market panic and to prevent the re-entry of enemy goods. Otherwise, economic panic will endanger society, and Chaozhou and Shantou will inevitably descend into banditry. We hope you will adopt our suggestions and provide a reply."</p>

<p>To the esteemed editors of the Shen Bao: I am writing regarding the news item published in your newspaper's local news column on the 22nd of this month, concerning the Hengxingtai Oil Mill's carelessness, where the machinery, oil, factory foundation, and buildings were all reduced to ashes, resulting in losses of hundreds of thousands. This is completely untrue. While our factory did suffer a fire that evening, it was only a portion of the hulling machine and grinding room. Fortunately, it was still early, and the fire was quickly extinguished by the fire brigades from various districts. There were no major losses. Fearing the spread of misinformation, we specifically write to correct this. Please publish this correction in the correction column to reflect the true situation and avoid misunderstandings. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Hengxingtai Oil Mill Co., Ltd. January 22nd.</p>

<p>Zhu Jiahao Gives a Speech, Ministry of Education Stops the Southwest from Changing the School System, and the Education Reform Plan is Under Review by the Standing Committee</p>
<h3 id="e197">There Are Students in North China Who Have Left School, but Not Many <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahao, Minister of Communications and concurrently Minister of Education, told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday that the Ministry of Education is still under his responsibility before Weng Wenhao takes office. Since he resigned as Minister of Education, the Central Government appointed Weng Wenhao as his successor, but Mr. Weng has been staying in Beiping for some matters and has not yet taken office, while he has not yet handed over the position. Therefore, he must continue to be responsible in fact. The Education Reform Committee of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee previously announced without authorization the abolition of winter and summer vacations, the reduction of the school year for universities and schools of all levels by one year, the division of one school year into four semesters, and a one-week vacation at the end of each semester. This is actually destroying the unity of the national school system. The Ministry of Education has sent a telegram to stop it. Some students in various schools in North China have left school without authorization, citing the tense situation, but not as many as reported in the newspapers. The Ministry of Education has sent a telegram to strictly stop it. As for the schools that have advanced their holidays, the Ministry of Education will give them appropriate punishment. The education reform plan proposed by Chen Guofu at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee is currently under review by the Standing Committee. Some of the points listed in the plan have already been implemented by the Ministry of Education, which has been detailed in the work report of the Ministry of Education. As for the rumor that the Labor University will be revived, it is absolutely untrue.</p>

<p>Hold a General Meeting After Returning to Beijing to Discuss Anti-Japanese Steps</p>
<p>Citizens of Beijing Ask the Central Government to Transfer Education Funds to Military Expenses</p>
<p>(Special Telegram from Beiping) After the loss of the Yuguan Pass, students from national and private universities in Beiping launched anti-Japanese movements, urging those who had fled to leave Beiping. Because the teaching staff was busy supervising and grading exams during the winter vacation, they did not show any anti-Japanese movement. The Standing Committee decided on the 18th to actively assist the delegation of volunteer troops. It was originally planned to go to the front line on the 19th to comfort the soldiers, but due to the problem of contacting vehicles, it was changed to the 20th. At the same time, 365 citizens of Beiping, including Chen Duxue, submitted a petition to the Central Government, requesting that the educational funds during the school suspension period of national universities be used for anti-Japanese military needs. The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:</p>

<p>The reporter specifically visited Wang Jixu, a representative of the Teachers' Association, at about 3 pm on the 19th to inquire about the mission to the front line and the contact situation in Beijing. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows: Our association held a temporary standing committee meeting yesterday and decided to assist the soldiers fighting on the front line. First, Yang Likui, Mou Tan, Jia Chengzhang, Liu Kuo, Xu Zhi, Liu Shichuan, Li Jianxun, and I were elected as representatives to comfort the soldiers fighting against Japan on the front line. The eight representatives, upholding the public teachings, contacted all parties and prepared to go to the front line immediately. Mr. Yang (Likui) and I went to the sub-committee of the Military Commission today to contact the vehicle problem. According to the person in charge, "There are few vehicles and it is very crowded. I will convey your association's intention to Chairman Zhang (Xueliang) and will reply by telephone tonight (19th)." After we withdrew, we believed that we could only change the travel date. After consideration, it was changed to tomorrow (20th). The mission of our association's representatives to the front line this time has three: 1. Carry comfort items to comfort the soldiers fighting against Japan. 2. Inspect the battle situation on the front line. 3.

<h3 id="e201">Suspension of Education Expenses Presented <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Chen Duxue and 365 other citizens of Beiping, because after the loss of Yuguan, students from various schools in Beiping did not engage in active anti-Japanese movements, but fled Beiping, which is contrary to the original intention of the country to cultivate students. During this school suspension period, the schools should no longer receive the education expenses from the state and the people's blood and sweat. They should be transferred to the anti-Japanese military needs to protect the country and shine the nation. The citizens today (18th) sent a telegram to the Kuomintang Central Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education of the Central Government, requesting the suspension of education expenses during the school suspension period and the transfer to anti-Japanese military needs. The original text is recorded on the left: "We present a request to suspend the education expenses of national schools in Ping City during the school suspension period and transfer them to anti-Japanese military needs. Since the fall of Yuguan, the whole country has been shocked. The Japanese bandits' ambition to invade Pingjin has been fully exposed. At this critical moment of national survival, it is time for our people to strive to save the country. Even the ignorant people have this heart, and those who usually pride themselves on being high-level intellectuals should set an example at this time, lead the people, and be the vanguard of anti-Japanese, so as not to fail the original intention of the country's cultivation. This is what is not necessary to say. How can the cannon in Yuguan make the students who are known for their patriotism so afraid and seem to have a great disaster over their heads, and all flee, treating their personal lives as Mount Tai, and treating the people and the country as grass, so-called school rules and exams can be abandoned and ignored, and the school authorities have no binding force and guidance. As a result, the school is empty, and the gate can be closed to sparrows. The sound of lying on the rails to petition in the past is no longer heard today. This phenomenon is deeply painful. Looking back at the soldiers on the front line who are fighting against Japan, they are in the midst of guns and bullets, bathed in the wind and rain, encouraging and fighting, and falling forward and following, putting their families aside and not cherishing their lives. What is the purpose? To fight for the country's personality and for the nation's survival. And how should we in the rear encourage and assist them to be the backing and comfort the loyal and brave? In fact, the so-called patriotic students, have not seen the shadow of the Japanese army, have first been afraid of an empty, I do not know what to say to explain, what face to face this country to sacrifice the soldiers? Check the country spent huge sums to establish schools, the original is to create talent, consolidate the national foundation, if now this is the student can not be their share, the teacher can not be their job, since the student can not be their share, the teacher can not fulfill their duties, then the talent created no way, how can the national foundation be consolidated, is the same as the original intention of the country to establish schools, is greatly contrary, the teachers and students how can they enjoy the most expensive fee from the state and the people's blood and sweat? This is the first reason to request the suspension of the school's education expenses during the suspension period. Since the students left the school, all administrative affairs have entered a state of suspension. Since the administrative affairs of the school have been suspended, the work of the staff should also cease. This is the second reason to request the suspension of the school's education expenses during the suspension period. Then the soldiers on the front line are in the midst of bitter cold, their clothes are single and thin, and their rations are insufficient, relying only on their hot blood. Therefore, instead of spending the country's money on useless places, why not transfer it to the urgent needs of the anti-Japanese, this should be the third reason to request the suspension of the school's education expenses during the suspension period. Moreover, the impact of the suspension of education expenses is, at most, a few teachers and staff in Ping City. If the anti-Japanese military needs are once lacking, the impact will be the future of the entire country and nation. And the teachers and staff in Ping City have many side businesses, and they will not be worried about the cold due to the suspension of education expenses. If the anti-Japanese soldiers are once suspended, they will have the worry of freezing to death and starving to death, and the country and the people will be lost because of it. What is the importance of its advantages and disadvantages, which is urgent and which is slow, this should be the fourth reason to request the suspension of the school's education expenses during the suspension period. In summary, for these four reasons, we have prepared a document to request the Ministry to transfer all the educational funds of the national schools in Ping City during the school suspension period to the anti-Japanese military needs, so as to meet the expectations of the living and comfort the souls of the dead. Then, those who are grateful are not only Duxue and others. On the verge of tears, we sincerely state our words and hope to be approved. We respectfully present to the Kuomintang Central Committee, the National Government Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and 365 citizens of Beiping, including Chen Duxue, Liang Guilin, Chen Ruoyu, Wang Shaolong, Yu Zhisheng, Li Yaohua, Yang Jianqi, Zhao Puqi, Lin Xianzhang, and Huang Zhenghan. (The names are not listed) We respectfully present to the National Government, the Central Party Department, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, (Sent on the 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e204">The County Education Association Requests that the Area Near the County Seat Be Designated as a Pilot Compulsory Education Zone <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>In order to popularize mass education and literacy, the Shanghai County Education Association has requested that the area near the new county seat be designated as a pilot compulsory education zone, and has specifically drafted reasons and methods to be submitted to the Administrative Committee of the County Education Bureau for adoption. The reasons and methods are listed below: (Reasons) To promote local autonomy and improve people's lives, popularizing education is the ladder and foundation. Although there are no detailed statistics on the number of illiterate people in our county, it is at least 60% or more, especially among adults. Although schools have been established everywhere, it is ultimately difficult to achieve universal education due to adherence to customs and economic constraints. It is considered that receiving education is a duty that citizens should fulfill. It is appropriate to delineate areas, conduct pilot compulsory education research methods, so as to not be hindered. If considerable results are obtained, then promote it to other areas, and the number of illiterates in our county may be sharply reduced. The new county seat area has convenient transportation and is the focus of attention. It is most suitable to be designated as a pilot compulsory education zone. (Methods) 1) Investigation and Statistics: Investigate and count the number of illiterate people within two li of the new county seat, and classify them by adults and children for statistics. 2) Zoning: Delineate the area and erect signs. 3) Supervisor: A director will be established in the pilot compulsory education zone, concurrently held by the Director of the Bureau or a member of the Education Committee. 4) Facilities: The existing primary schools within the zone will be directly under the jurisdiction of the director, and social work or school-style educational facilities will be increased as appropriate. Teachers will be transferred from various county-affiliated agencies and organizations. 5) Time Limit: Hypothetically three years. 6) Expenses: Borne jointly by various county-affiliated agencies and organizations. (According to law, various agencies and organizations have the obligation to establish mass schools.)</p>

<p>The game between Huadong and the Eagle team of the Shanghai Basketball Association last night was extremely intense. Most of the Huadong players were from Chih-Tze, while the Eagle team had two famous players, Lin Zequn and Kong Guangmeng, so their strength was also strong. As a result, Huadong won 45 to 38. In the second game, Hujiang vs. the 7th team, the situation was one-sided. Hujiang won by a large margin of 92 to 11. There will be only one Group A match tonight, Datong vs. Mailing. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>In the second Group A match between Huadong and the Eagle team, the situation was tense. Huadong was mainly composed of Chih-Tze players, plus Yang Long as center and Chen Rong as defense. The Eagle team was joined by former Yale player Lin Ze and former Chih-Tze player Kong Guangyi, two great players, so their strength was also very strong. The competition between the two sides was wonderful, and the situation was fierce, with the scores close. The difference in scores was often between one or two points. At the end of the first half, Huadong won by five points, 23 to 18. When the battle resumed, the competition became even more intense, and the Eagle team once tied the score at 25 to 25, but unfortunately failed to surpass it. From then on, Huadong's momentum gradually increased, and their work was meticulous. Qian Dingxin scored repeatedly, and Kong Guangyi's long shots were especially appreciated by the audience. After that, the difference in scores was at most eleven points, such as 39 to 28 and 41 to 30. The Eagle team also had a moment of gaining the upper hand, with Dai Boxiang adding two goals in a row, and Lin Zequn also scoring one, and the scores suddenly narrowed again, but in the end, Huadong won 45 to 38.</p>

<p>The Hujiang University basketball team could not participate in the Shanghai Basketball Association due to financial difficulties. Although they still use the name Hujiang, they have joined the Donghua Sports Club. Center Wu Guolin left Shanghai on vacation and was replaced by Lu Zhongen. Although the lineup is not as complete as the previous Hujiang, it is more than enough to defeat the newly formed 7th team. They ran rampant and the situation was one-sided. When Hujiang scored 16, the 7th team just started to score. At halftime, Hujiang won 39 to 7. In the second half, Hujiang's work became more intense, and the 7th team was fully prepared, but in the end, Hujiang won 92 to 11. Feng Nianhua scored 36 points alone.</p>

<p>Pirates are Fierce, Military Academy Strengthens Defense</p>
<p>Work Hard, Victory Over Pirates is More Than Enough</p>
<p>The Central Military Academy basketball team will make its third appearance in Shanghai tonight, against the Xiqing Pirate team that roams the sea. Starting at 8 PM in the Xiqing basketball room, judging from the Military Academy's performance against John, the Military Academy has restored its original state, with accurate throws and perfect cooperation. The venue is also becoming familiar, which is more than enough to face the Xiqing Pirates. The pirates have been rampant at sea for four years, and only Northeast University has once severely defeated them. It is hoped that the Military Academy will follow in the footsteps of Northeast University and win glory for the Chinese in Shanghai. As for the Military Academy's confrontation with the pirates, there are enough points to offer. The Military Academy is good at long-range shooting and has no worries. In terms of defense, we must pay close attention. The pirates dribble very far, center Bennett jumps very well, and right forward Qi is an accurate shooter and is most dangerous with his long legs. Right forward Smith is also a good fighter. The two guards, Shaulivan and Pirre, must be guarded against, especially Pirre. The Military Academy should pay attention to it. The lineups of the two teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Central Military Academy</p>
<p>Yong Chang (Right Forward) Gao Lingzhao (Right Guard)</p>
<p>Huang Jianding (Center)</p>
<p>Li Gongyu (Left Forward) Wang Shixuan (Left Guard)</p>
<p>Xiqing Pirates</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Business Situation</p>
<p>Adding some foreign official arrogance made the general public feel the dread of hospitals, even to the point of using hospitals to represent the face of foreigners. The Chinese-run hospitals, such as the Red Cross Hospital and the Shanghai Public Hospital, were small in scale and lacked economic resources, and were unable to carry out much work. In the past twenty years, more labor hospitals and affiliated hospitals of several medical schools have appeared. Together with the small-scale public hospitals outside the city, there are no fewer than twenty or thirty. I will now list the Shanghai Public Hospitals in the table below, and note their nature, departments, and scale for readers to refer to. However, omissions are inevitable. If there are any omissions, please point them out.</p>
<p>Hospital Name Chinese/Foreign Scale Departments Wards Nature and System</p>
<p>Renji Hospital Foreign Large Famous Departments All Levels Church</p>
<p>Tung Ren Hospital Foreign Large Famous Departments All Levels Church</p>

<p>Pushan Hospital Chinese Small All Departments Commoner Charity Group Charity Clinic Trustee System</p>
<p>(Now Suspended)</p>
<p>Tongde Obstetrics Hospital Chinese Small Obstetrics All Levels School Affiliated</p>
<p>Pingmin Obstetrics Hospital Chinese Small Obstetrics Commoner Trustee System</p>
<p>And so on, omitted for brevity</p>
<p>The so-called scale in the table is based on the average calculation of houses and equipment. Among the levels of wards, the so-called high-level refers to ordinary people who cannot afford even their third-class ward, and the so-called middle-level refers to wards that are too simple and unrefined for the general capitalist class to live in. The so-called commoner is close to accepting only poor people, which ordinary middle-class people do not want to live in. Only those with all levels seem to be the most inclusive. However, the prices of wards also vary from hospital to hospital. Generally, the third-class ward costs more than five jiao per day, which makes the poor flinch. The second-class ward costs more than two yuan, which is considered expensive for middle-class people. Based on the above table, the following points can be distinguished: 1) Among the 30 hospitals listed, 12 are larger in scale, but 9 are foreign-run; 2) There are 7 hospitals specially set up for commoners, but 3 are for treating cholera, one is for obstetrics, and is unrelated to other diseases (However, the Emergency Plague Hospital provides daily consultation and medicine during non-cholera periods, without taking any fees.); 3) Among the 30 hospitals, only 3 have gynecology departments, and pediatrics is attached to gynecology. The number of beds is small, which can be imagined. If the number of children in the city is taken as a ratio, the difference is too great; 4) Although there are many obstetrics hospitals, there are very few with local public nature. This table only includes a moderate amount, but it is still insufficient.</p>
<p>Looking at the above points, the hospital situation in Shanghai can really be said to be still under deformity. To put it in a vulgar way, it is simply uneven. As for why there are so few public hospitals, there are also several reasons, which I will now discuss:</p>

<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>㈤ Fetus</p>
<p>(A) First Half of Pregnancy... The fetus is very small and floats in the amniotic fluid. Its position changes frequently;</p>
<p>(B) Second Half of Pregnancy... The fetus grows larger and its position can no longer change, so there is a fixed fetal position;</p>
<p>(C) Normal Delivery... Normal delivery is also called spontaneous delivery, which accounts for about 99% of deliveries. It is divided into cephalic presentation (head down), breech presentation (buttocks down), and lower limb presentation (foot or knee down). Among these three, cephalic presentation is the most common, accounting for about 96%;</p>
<p>(D) Transverse Lie... This means that the diameter of the fetus crosses with the diameter of the uterus, accounting for about 1%. The common saying that the fetus must turn its head during delivery is completely untenable;</p>
<p>(E) Posture... The fetus has a fixed posture in the uterus during the second half of pregnancy, taking a Turkish sitting position, with the head bent forward towards the chest, the back curved, the upper limbs crossed in front of the chest, and the lower limbs bent forward towards the upper abdomen;</p>
<p>(F) Fetal Nutrition... In the first three weeks of pregnancy, the ovum has its own inherent nutrition. In the fourth week, the decidua absorbs nutrients. After the umbilical cord tissue is established, it is transported by the blood vessels in the umbilical cord. Most of the fetal excrement is also transported back to the mother's body through the umbilical cord;</p>
<p>(G) Fetal Movement... Starting from the fifth month of pregnancy, the pregnant woman feels the fetus moving in her abdomen. This is caused by the stretching and contraction of the fetus's trunk and limbs.</p>
<p>㈥ Pregnancy Status</p>
<p>(A) Various Signs are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Previously regular menstruation suddenly stops;</p>
<p>(2) Frequent urination, because the uterus grows upwards during the second or third month of pregnancy, compressing the bladder;</p>
<p>(3) Nausea and vomiting, occurring around the second or third month of pregnancy, or even as early as the first month. It initially occurs in the early morning and is very common!</p>
<p>(4) The breasts become slightly swollen and distended from the second month of pregnancy, and they feel exquisitely sensitive. The areola pigment turns reddish-brown, and the nipples protrude. Between the fourth and fifth months, if you press on the breast, thin milk can be squeezed out;</p>
<p>(5) Abdominal enlargement. In the first month of pregnancy, the uterus is the size of a pigeon egg. In the second month, it is as large as a goose egg. In the third month, it is as large as a child's head. In the above three months, the uterus only enlarges in the pelvic cavity. The outside of the abdomen can already be clearly touched. By the fourth month, the uterus ascends and enters the abdominal cavity. By the fifth month, the uterus is level with the navel. By the eighth month, the bottom of the uterus is between the navel and the tip of the sternum. By the ninth month, the bottom of the uterus is at the tip of the sternum. In the tenth month, it bends forward towards the abdominal wall and lowers again, similar to the eighth month.</p>
<p>(B) Various Abnormalities are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Pregnancy Line... In multiparous women during the ninth or tenth month, faint red or purplish-red streaks appear on the skin of the abdomen. These are old scars from previous pregnancies;</p>
<p>(2) First Perception of Fetal Movement... The pregnant woman first feels fetal movement in the abdomen around the fourth or fifth month (20th week);</p>
<p>(3) Uterine Contractions... If you place your fingers on the bottom of the uterus of a pregnant woman's abdomen, you will feel that the area being pressed changes from slightly hard to harder, and then gradually softens again, but it cannot be determined whether she is pregnant or not;</p>
<p>(4) Changes in Reproductive Organs... The mucous membranes of the vulva and vagina are thicker than usual and turn into distinct purple wrinkles. The muscles around the vulva proliferate, and the vulva cavity expands and lengthens. The labia majora sometimes show enlarged veins;</p>
<p>(5) Vaginal secretions are more abundant than usual, and the temperature is also higher;</p>
<p>(6) Cervix... Softer than usual. In the early stages of pregnancy, the cervix is light purple. By the end of pregnancy, it is blue. The cervical shape is shorter;</p>
<p>(7) Pelvic Joints... During pregnancy, the pelvic joints can relax, and during childbirth, the joints can move slightly;</p>
<p>(8) Heart Changes Position... When the uterus enlarges, it presses all the abdominal organs backwards, or to the sides or upwards, pushing the diaphragm upwards, causing the heart to move from its original position;</p>
<p>(9) Varicose Veins... During the second half of pregnancy, varicose veins often appear on the legs and anus (hemorrhoids). If they already exist, they will worsen at this time;</p>
<p>(10) Lung Compression... When the abdomen is very distended, the diaphragm presses upwards, causing the lungs to be compressed, and the shoulders move when breathing;</p>
<p>(11) Nervous System... The pregnant woman's nerves are disturbed by pregnancy, her temperament changes, and she sometimes experiences symptoms such as toothache, headache, bone pain, and dizziness. Her preferences also often change, and she experiences unpredictable joy, anger, worry, and depression. Some women are also mentally agile and very lively;</p>
<p>(12) Digestive System... In addition to nausea and vomiting, there are also drooling, spitting, heartburn, and constipation;</p>
<p>(13) Systemic Changes... Sometimes the body is healthier than usual after conception. Sometimes there are systemic changes, which are very complex. Sometimes they are discovered at the beginning of pregnancy, and sometimes they are discovered at the end, but they should not be considered diseases. However, the intensity of the changes varies from person to person;</p>
<p>(14) Abnormal Skin Pigmentation... In addition to the areola turning purplish-brown, dark circles appear under the eyelids, and yellow or brownish-purple spots appear on the midline of the face, forehead, neck, and abdomen. Even beautiful women often change color;</p>
<p>(15) Swaying Posture... Because the abdomen protrudes forward, the pregnant woman bends her upper body backwards to maintain her center of gravity, so even though she is hunchbacked when walking, it is like this.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Good Medicine in Our Eyes and Good Medicine in General Eyes <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>In the first issue of this magazine, I mentioned good doctors in our eyes versus good doctors in the public's eyes. I received favorable feedback from readers, who believe that the current social chaos and lack of intellectual discernment have created opportunities for troublemakers, making the social situation even darker, which is truly heartbreaking. However, I believe that the mixture of transitional eras is a common principle in the world. Because the changes and evolution of everything have stages, and with stages, there will be succession. During succession, various incomplete phenomena and abnormal things will inevitably occur. Therefore, our current society is in a period of change and evolution, and of course, various strange and unexpected things will occur. However, the individuals during the period of succession cannot exhibit the same stage because their rates of change and evolution are different. For example, we are also a member of the current society. Why are our views different from those of the general public? This is related to the rate of change and evolution. Didn't I say last time that the distance in intellectual concepts between individuals in our Chinese society today spans two to three thousand years? In the same era and society, when intellectual concepts are so far apart, it is inevitable that there will be a sense of "us" versus "them."</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk about the intellectual concept of medicine. Medicine is originally a substance used to treat diseases. Anything that can achieve the goal of treating disease is good medicine, and anything that cannot is not good medicine. This seems like a very simple question. What difference is there between "us" and "them" in this regard? That's right, but the term "good medicine" is very difficult to make in reality. There are things that are truly good medicine but have not been verified, there are relatively good medicines that still need to be improved, there are things that are good medicine but whose usage is unclear, and there are many so-called good medicines, advertised good medicines, and whatnot good medicines. The degrees of superiority and inferiority and the differences in understanding are truly up to individual judgment, and it is difficult to say everything in one word. Whether or not the goal of treating disease can be achieved may not have a true or false standard. It is difficult to avoid the murmuring of the people of Chu, so it is inevitable that Qu Yuan would lament the worthlessness of common things, and the question of whether or not good medicine is truly good medicine ultimately falls into a fog.</p>
<p>In our eyes, the good medicine we currently hope for and recognize is not satisfied simply because it can cure one or a few people's illnesses. The true quality of medicine must meet each of the conditions written below. The good medicine we consider must first supplement or suppress the local abnormal mass that caused a disease and restore it to its original state. In other words, it restores the original anatomical mass, not the physiological function. For example, in the case of stroke, we know it is a brain hemorrhage. If we can restore the changes in the brain to their original state, then the stroke will naturally be cured. Also, for example, in the case of diabetes, we know it is a change in the islet tissue of the pancreas. If we can restore the abnormal state, then diabetes will naturally be completely cured. Medicines that can resolve this type of anatomical change are the highest-grade good medicines in our eyes. The next best thing is medicines that restore local physiological function without affecting other parts of the body. For example, in the case of stomach pain, the physiological abnormality is limited to the stomach. When we use painkillers, it is important to use local painkillers. In other words, it is only appropriate if it only stops the stomach pain and does not affect other parts of the body that are not in pain. Currently, the use of local anesthetics such as cocaine is considered the best, but these types of drugs, when absorbed into the body, can cause many side effects. As for morphine and related drugs that numb everything with one injection, and tetrodotoxin that paralyzes nerve endings, these common anesthetic drugs are even lower grade. Also, for example, digitalis has a special effect on the heart muscle, and atropine has a special effect on the pupillary sphincter muscle. The same muscle, yet its effect is particularly significant, which is indeed a valuable medicine. However, side effects are still unavoidable. Therefore, we hope very much that medicines that restore local physiological function will not affect other parts of the body. Only then can they be considered second-grade good medicines. As for bactericidal drugs, they can also be considered an important type of medicine for controlling pathogens. However, there are many bactericidal drugs for external use, but not many bactericidal drugs for internal use. This is because internal sterilization must take into account the need to avoid harming the host. If a drug has bactericidal power, it may also kill somatic cells. Therefore, it is difficult to find drugs that are more toxic to bacteria and less toxic to somatic cells. For example, salvarsan is weakly toxic to somatic cells and strongly toxic to bacteria. Also, quinine is weakly toxic to somatic cells and strongly toxic to sporozoa. There are also various animal immune serums that are weakly toxic to somatic cells and strongly toxic to various infectious bacteria. These types of drugs are rare today, and they are not satisfactory. It is quite difficult to find a good medicine that is strongly toxic to pathogens and non-toxic to somatic cells. If there is such a medicine, it can be considered a third-grade good medicine in our eyes. In addition, there are many medicines that have many effects, and the medicine with the strongest effect is considered the main medicine. There are countless names and complex formulas, but in reality, aren't they just modified versions of the same substances? These types of drugs are the most commonly used today, and doctors struggle the most to thoroughly solve diseases. It wouldn't be too harsh to classify them as fourth or fifth grade, would it? Therefore, the first-grade good medicines in our eyes can restore the abnormal anatomical mass, the second-grade can restore the local physiological function, and the third-grade is only for substances that kill pathogens in the body. Other medicines that repair trivial parts and the most common symptomatic medicines can only be classified as fourth or fifth grade.</p>
<p>As for the good medicine in the eyes of the general public, that is completely different from our understanding. Their central judgment is dominated by their ears and eyes. The efficacy of their good medicine is completely dictated by their state of mind. Therefore, their good medicine is propaganda-based medicine, psychological medicine, and it can almost be said to be completely unrelated to the original purpose and function of medicine. For these types of medicines, whether it's sand, incense ash, or any kind of grass root or tree bark, nothing is bad. Therefore, all kinds of bizarre things are heavily advertised and fill our Divine Land, dazzling our eyes and ears, and almost no one can tell the difference between east, west, south, and north. However, having said that, there are still high and low grades among the medicines that the general public considers good. Because the good medicines of the general public are originally over-the-counter medicines, in other words, folk remedies. The nature of these types of medicines is to fit the medicine to the disease, not to fit the medicine to the disease according to the prescription of a doctor. Therefore, they have different tendencies from the symptomatic medicines prescribed by doctors. However, among over-the-counter medicines, there are also things that conform to scientific principles and are indeed scientific products, and are welcomed and used by doctors. However, the majority are off track or are completely deceptive forgeries, deceiving the public who lack medical knowledge, and aiming to absorb the money of women and the poor. Comparatively better ones have similar efficacy and quality, but they are always exaggerations. The lowest grade ones say one thing about efficacy and another thing about quality, mixing things up and talking nonsense. That's really terrible. Recently, I saw an advertisement saying that there is a type of domestic medicine called something-something-su, which he claimed had 2 million times the powerful phlegm-resolving and cough-suppressing power. When mathematics talks about multiples, there must first be a unit. I don't know how to calculate this unit of phlegm-resolving and cough-suppressing efficacy. If there is no unit and it is called 2 million times, isn't that a huge joke? For example, the efficacy of this type of medicine is too far off or completely opposite, and some people who are deceived and anesthetized by it may consider it a kind of good medicine, which is not known. There are also what grass, what essence, what pills, powders, ointments, and elixirs for days and nights. What he advertises and attracts are people who are outside the medical world. What he squeezes and induces is the money of general pitiful people. These pitiful people still think they are extremely clever and can choose the world's most advanced magic medicine to bring the dead back to life, which is truly pitiful to the end. I used to investigate the standards for managing over-the-counter medicines in various countries overseas. There are differences in the strictness of his standards. Some must be effective for a certain disease to be considered qualified, and some only require that they be non-toxic and do not harm physiology to be considered qualified. However, at least there is the restriction that the prescription and medicine must match, and the efficacy must not deviate from the medicine. Therefore, the law of medicine advertising is very important and very strict. Alas, in our current situation, I don't know where to start. I can only put down my pen here.</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Urgent Need to Advocate for Domestic Medicines is a Reaction to the Correction of Non-Scientific Medicine <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Dingan</p>
<p>In the world, everything has a cause and then a result; has an object and then a motive; and then generates a reaction. We know the warlords abuse and harm the people. Therefore, there is a national revolution. We know the economic oppression, so we must resist capitalist aggression! Is it not the same with academic matters? We have seen the absurdities of non-scientific medicine and the deceptions of a kind of non-scientific medicine that has recently been on the sea. For the sake of the future of Chinese medical science, we are compelled to rise up and carry out this scientific movement to advocate for domestic medicines because of this reaction.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Western medicines and Chinese medicine shops from foreign countries are leaking large quantities every year, which affects the entire national economy dangerously. At the same time, we have seen that some people in the country want to do some speculative deals in response to the trend, but they cannot create domestic medicines according to scientific methods. They can only rely on advertising to deceive Chinese compatriots, and they can only deceive compatriots who have no medical knowledge. The scientific foundation has lost its center of gravity. This kind of advocacy for non-scientific medicines and the parallel fallacies and errors of non-scientific medicine have the same direction. Originally, advocating for domestic medicines is a very good thing, but using domestic medicines without creating them according to scientific methods is just superficially reclaiming rights and can replace the functions of imported goods. This kind of non-scientific medicine is really not the original intention of what we want to advocate for creating scientific domestic medicines. Because this cannot achieve academic progress, it is not a thorough solution. Therefore, in order to catch up quickly and meet the current urgent needs, all medical colleagues in the country should completely use scientific methods to select several kinds of domestic medicines that should be created first, or several kinds that have already been registered, and manufacture them according to pharmaceutical procedures. We must establish a solid scientific foundation and then seek other kinds of accomplishments. Pharmacists should obtain the main components from the analytical aspect and apply pharmacology to animal experiments. Medical scientists should use the pharmacological aspect to identify the therapeutic functions of drugs. Some people cannot report the main components that have been analyzed at one time, so they can continue to study them successively. It seems that we can first conduct experiments on several kinds that we are already sure of in advance, get the results, and then manufacture them first. We must indeed obtain the true evidence that can be reported in the scientific community from the conscience before we can create a certain drug for application to humans as a therapeutic drug. Of course, non-scientific medicine is popular in society, does not cure diseases, and does not send people to their deaths, which is not necessarily a very serious problem. If there are no scientifically based reports internationally, the academic community will not have the slightest impact, or they will cover up all the weaknesses with secret prescriptions and secret preparations and follow suit, then they can apply it to various drugs. If it contains very violent components, they will also think that it is not important, and they will create it vaguely, I am afraid that it will definitely lead to very large abuses and dangers. From this point of view, the scientific method of pharmaceutical manufacturing, using domestic medicines to manufacture medicines, has a certain procedure, a certain pharmaceutical procedure, and more scientific research, which can also be regarded as the minimum standard when we advocate for domestic medicines and plan to create them. I hope that the colleagues in the new medical field will actively think about creating domestic medicines in order to reclaim rights and promote scholarship. I also think that it is the duty of a citizen to participate in the work of advocating for domestic medicines if the old medical community can recognize the general trend and jump out of metaphysics and move into the scientific community to surrender. Chinese medicine shops should also supply materials and help accomplish the great cause. What is called science to save the country, in this critical moment, with scientific knowledge, using scientific methods, and creating domestic medicines, is not it a very clear fact?</p>

<h3 id="e221">A Glimpse into the Recent Decline of Major Products in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Widespread banditry leads to the collapse of the rural economy.</p>
<p>Production experiences a major setback, and exports plummet.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province is rich in products, among which porcelain, wood, tea, paper, and ramie cloth are the mainstays of the province's import and export trade. The total trade value annually reaches 30 to 40 million yuan. In recent years, banditry has spread throughout the province, and local products have declined daily. The rural economy has collapsed accordingly, and the poverty of the region is readily apparent. Here is a brief account of the recent situation of porcelain, tea, paper, and wood in Jiangxi Province, in order to illustrate the decline of major industries in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Porcelain</p>
<p>Jingdezhen porcelain has always been renowned for its fine quality and precious value. For centuries, it has been praised without decline, not only being the best in the country but also well-known in the West. Before 1927, production was at its peak, with an average annual total value of about 10 million yuan. Its sales extended to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Recently, according to a survey by the Porcelain Affairs Bureau, there are a total of 23 types of porcelain businesses, with 1,504 kiln factories, 22,029 workers, and a capital of 1,535,885 yuan. The total annual output value is 5,600,6151 yuan, a decrease of more than 4 million yuan compared to before 1927. There are two reasons for this decline. Before 1927, there were more than 70 large and small money houses in Jingdezhen, and the financial situation was active. If a porcelain merchant brought a town draft for 10,000 yuan to purchase porcelain, they could sell the draft to the money house. The money house only paid with a promissory note (from 100 to 2 yuan), which could be cashed at any time and circulated in the market, making transactions very convenient. Therefore, the money supply was smooth, and trade developed accordingly. After 1927, wars were frequent, and the financial situation was critical. Town drafts became ineffective, and the promissory notes issued by the money houses were also stranded and could not be discounted. As a result, credit was lost, and the market became difficult to circulate. Even the oldest and most reliable money houses reduced their business scope and became more cautious in lending. This is one reason for the decline of the porcelain industry due to economic distress. In recent years, Communist bandits repeatedly captured and plundered, causing significant damage to the porcelain industry. After the September 18th Incident, sales in the three northeastern provinces were completely blocked. Merchants from Yingkou, Harbin, and Guandong did not come. In addition, other provinces were difficult to transport to due to military blockades and traffic obstructions. This is another reason for the decline due to military and banditry influences. The former establishment of the Ceramic Industry Department, was determined to take on the responsibility of guidance and improvement of porcelain production, by setting up a Ceramics Department within the Bureau, to study the improvement of the porcelain industry, and set up a Ceramics Affairs Bureau in Jingdezhen, in addition to undertaking technical affairs, it is also responsible for all aspects of guidance of the porcelain industry. Since its establishment, although gradual results have been seen, there is still no thorough improvement. This spring, due to the impact of the Shanghai war, the money supply was extremely tight, and porcelain businesses were plagued by economic problems. In addition, the provincial government established a special bureau in Jingdezhen to collect porcelain taxes in order to handle the suppression of bandits, increasing the burden on porcelain merchants. In September, there was a strike and business suspension. Last month, the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiao, and other porcelain industry representatives went to Jiangxi to request the authorities to abolish the tax and change it to a business tax, fixed at 440,000 per year. Compared to the year when porcelain production was at its peak, the burden on porcelain merchants has not been reduced. Moreover, since the Mid-Autumn Festival, it has been the off-season for porcelain sales, and most porcelain merchants from various provinces have returned home. Also, due to the approaching end of the year, the financial situation is extremely tight. In the past month, only a dozen kilns have been fired in Jingdezhen, and no one has asked about the porcelain products. The market is depressed, which is unprecedented in recent years. The future of the porcelain industry is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Tea</p>
<p>Jiangxi has always been the richest tea-producing area in the western part of the Yangtze River. Green tea from Dexing and Yushan, and black tea from Xiushui, Hekou, and Fuliang are the main exports of the province. In the heyday of tea production, Xiushui foreign-owned black tea companies had an annual output of 160,000 to 170,000 boxes, Hekou 20,000 to 30,000 boxes, Dexing also produced more than 20,000 boxes in 1928, and Fuliang more than 40,000 boxes. In the past ten years, Xiushui and Wuning black tea, initially because Russian sales were weak and prices were low, tea farmers suffered losses. Therefore, merchants from Anhui and Guangdong who came to the mountains to set up businesses have decreased year by year. Mountain households, because tea prices were low, mostly cut down tea trees and planted other crops. Those who did not cut them down also did not add manpower and fertilizer to the management and cultivation, so the quality gradually deteriorated. Foreign merchants who process tea mostly abandoned Ning Hong and preferred Qihong. In recent years, production has decreased even more sharply. This year, only a few local companies came to the mountains to set up businesses. Hekou black tea, because the quality is even worse than Ning production, foreign merchants have raised and lowered prices, and business is also stagnant. This year, there are only a few companies operating black tea in Hekou and three companies operating green tea in Yushan. The total output is only about 10,000 boxes, which is far less than ten years ago. Dexing green tea, because the production area borders Wuyuan, the quality is not bad. Two years ago, the output was still more than 10,000 boxes. Since last year, when the Communists occupied the area, it has become a bandit area. Farmers cannot harvest and process tea in time during the new tea growth period. Tea leaves are abandoned on the ground, and there has been no production for two years. Only Fuliang black tea relies on the reputation of Qimen and has managed to survive. However, this year, due to the tight money supply, tea firms have reduced their remittances, and fewer companies have set up businesses than in previous years. The produced tea is also subject to price suppression by foreign merchants, resulting in great losses. The fate of Fuliang tea is gradually narrowing, and it will show the same declining trend as Xiushui black tea. Recently, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, in order to understand the actual situation of the decline of Xiushui tea, sent personnel to Jiangxi in April to investigate, and reported the improvement opinions to the Ministry of Industry. The plan to revive the tea industry is very thorough. Recently, Chairman Xiong, in view of the decline of Ning tea, will also organize a large-scale company to set up a factory in Jiujiang in order to save the endangered tea industry. If the above two facilities can be implemented, then Xiushui black tea still has a glimmer of hope. It is a gratifying news that Jiangxi's tea industry, which has fallen into a deep abyss, has been given a helping hand.</p>
<p>Paper</p>
<p>Jiangxi is located on the south bank of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with a mild climate and lush bamboo forests everywhere. The abundance of bamboo production is the highest in the country, so the development of its paper industry is also a natural trend. There are more than eighty counties under the jurisdiction of the province, and paper-producing counties account for more than half of the counties. Among them, the largest output is in the four prefectures of Ji'an, Ganzhou, , and , followed by the four prefectures of Yuanzhou, Guangxin, Fuzhou, and Jianchang. The areas with relatively large output are Shicheng, Taihe, and Yichun counties. There are more than 6,900 households engaged in papermaking in the province, with 30,000 workers. The types of fine paper include Lian Shi, Mao Bian, Xuan Paper, , Xin Pi Paper, Hu Guan Oil Paper, Biao Xin, and imitation Western paper, etc. Coarse paper includes Zhong Biao Xin, Hua Jian, Yuan Biao Xuan Biao, Mian , Ci Biao, Bi Zhou Ci Biao, Liang Kou Kun Biao, and Xiao Paper. Fine paper is mainly Mao Bian, Lian Shi, Gong Chuan, Zou Mu Bamboo Paper, Bai , and Pu Paper. The annual output of Mao Bian is about one million yuan, and the annual output of Lian Shi is about one and a half million yuan. The total output of other fine papers is about 500,000 yuan. Among coarse papers, the annual output of paper and fire paper is about 40,000 yuan. The annual output of fire paper concentrated in Wucheng, Fengxin, and Jing'an is about one million yuan. The total amount of consumption in other places is also 3 million yuan. According to a survey in 1918, the total output of coarse and fine paper in the province was 8,116,163 yuan. In recent years, Ganzhou, Fengxin, and Jing'an fire paper in North China have plummeted. The reason is that the manufacturing method has not been improved. Except for sacrificial purposes, it has no other uses. The area of the paper production in the province has not been peaceful for years, and transportation is difficult. The enthusiasm of those engaged in this industry is negative, and the output has decreased sharply. The sales volume in North China used to be about 3 million yuan, but now it is only hundreds of thousands of yuan. In addition, the Mao Bian and Lian Shi produced by machine-made paper mills in Shanghai are superior to Jiangxi products and the prices are cheaper. Those who used to use Jiangxi paper now mostly buy products from Shanghai factories. The sales market of Mao Bian and Lian Shi has also been taken over by Shanghai paper by half, so Jiangxi's paper industry will decline from now on, and it is difficult to restore its former prosperity.</p>
<p>Wood</p>
<p>Most counties in Jiangxi Province are mountainous and have always been famous for producing wood. The largest variety is fir wood from Ganzhou, Longnan, Ruijin, Shangyou, Chongyi, Suichuan, and other places in southern Jiangxi, followed by camphor wood. Fir wood produced in Ganzhou is the best, because the mountainous area upstream of Ganzhou is fertile, the climate is mild, and it is most suitable for planting wood. The produced wood is firm, slender, durable, and long-lasting. Except for the Guang wood produced in Changde, it can be called the best material of fir wood in our country. The largest sales volume is in Jiangsu Province, followed by various ports in the province and Wanwu. Exported wood is transported from the production area to Wucheng for centralized manufacturing and compiled into wooden rafts. After passing through Poyang Lake, it is directly released into Nanjing and unloaded into small rafts, then transported to Changzhou for sale. Changzhou is a centralized area for wood from Jiangxi and Hubei. Most of the wood sold is also produced in Jiangxi. The total annual sales value is about 7 million yuan, and the annual sales value in Wanwu and the province is about 8 million yuan. In terms of value, it has increased compared to the past. In terms of output, it has decreased compared to the past. In the early years of the Republic of China, the value of western wood was about ten coins. Now it has increased to forty or fifty coins. The value is four times that of the past. In recent years, most of the wood-producing counties in southern Jiangxi have been ravaged by bandits, and transportation is difficult. This year, Changzhou wood businesses, due to the decline of the silk industry in Jiangsu Province, the price of cocoons in various counties has not risen, and the economy of farmers is difficult, so they are unable to engage in construction. The demand for wood has been greatly reduced. In the past, each Changzhou company sold more than one million yuan of wood each year, but this year it is only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Those who operate western wood in Linjiang and Hui mostly hoard it and cannot sell it. The sales market of fir wood in Jiangsu Province this year has fallen into a sluggish state. Camphor wood is sold in the northern provinces and in the province for the manufacture of wooden furniture and leather boxes, but the output and sales volume are only one-tenth of fir wood, which is insignificant to the rise and fall of wood.</p>
<p>Ramie Cloth</p>
<p>Jiangxi's ramie production is very rich, and the output of ramie cloth is also more than other provinces. The largest production areas are Wanzai, Yifeng, Chongren, Fuzhou, and other counties, followed by Ningdu, Hekou, and Yushan counties. Its exports are sold in major commercial ports at home and abroad. The total annual value is about 5 million yuan. The quality of ramie cloth in various counties is the best in Wanzai, and it is called the best product in the country together with the products produced in Liuyang, Hunan. The overseas sales are mostly needed by the United States and Korea. For example, the Western tablecloths produced by Jiangxi Women's Handicraft Society are especially welcomed by Americans. However, in the past two years, most of the ramie cloth producing areas have become bandit areas, and men and women workers cannot work with peace of mind, and the output has decreased. The sales market in Korea has also been restricted by the Japanese government due to my country's boycott of Japanese goods. The sales volume has decreased sharply. This year, the production and sales volume of ramie cloth in various counties is only 40% of the previous year.</p>
<h3 id="e222">A Review of China's Silk Industry in the Past Year <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Dingyuan</p>
<p>In recent years, it has been a period of decline for China's silk industry. In the recent one or two years, the degree of its intensification has reached its extreme. The entire silk industry is in a precarious state of bankruptcy. From the silkworm-raising farmers at the bottom to the silk merchants at the top, as well as the silver and money industries that provide financial support, all are in a deep and painful situation and cannot extricate themselves.</p>
<p>Raw silk is the main commodity in China's international trade. Its failure affects all farmers, merchants, and workers engaged in the silk industry, which are closely related and cannot be exempted. Since the spread of the global recession, raw silk, which has the nature of a luxury item, has naturally been affected first. Overseas demand has suddenly decreased, and inventory cannot be sold. As a result, China's silk merchants and silk factories have been trapped in a stranded predicament. The silk cocoons mortgaged to the silver and money industries cannot be redeemed, and they have fallen into bankruptcy. The number of unemployed workers is increasing, and labor disputes have begun, and have become even worse since the January 28th Incident.</p>
<p>Silk merchants cannot redeem the mortgaged silk cocoons, and financial funds are greatly affected. On the one hand, they cannot continue to finance, and silk merchants are in more difficult situation. On the other hand, because cocoons cannot be stored for a long time, they have to find ways to process them on behalf of the silk factories, in order to avoid wasting resources and reduce losses. After the Shanghai war, a considerable number of silk factories eked out a living by processing old cocoons, which was a very miserable situation.</p>
<p>The decline of China's silk industry did not start today. It has attracted the attention of the whole country. The government and the public are competing to find a way out, such as organizing the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Old Factory Silk Sales Committee, and establishing the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Old Factory Silk Cocoon Committee. The government is also eagerly promoting and issuing public bonds, trying to remedy the situation. In the spring this year, the decline of the silk industry had little to do with ordinary silk merchants, but directly affected the silkworm-raising farmers. The farmers' meager funds could not withstand unexpected and significant blows. As a result, the voice of rural bankruptcy became tense, and social order was disturbed. The reason for this is that the silk merchants this year saw the slump in the overseas silk market, the excessive old inventory, and the inflexibility of the finance. They stood by and watched. The price of cocoons and silk (referring to local silk) fell sharply, almost unattended. Compared with the competition in previous years, it cannot be measured. The decline of the silk industry has been for many years, but last spring, the general silk merchants did not know that the world economic panic had reached this extreme, so they still widely searched and bought, and finally the silk merchants suffered too much loss. This spring, silk merchants learned from the failure last year and tried to tighten up, and the price of cocoons plummeted, and the farmers suffered. Therefore, in the declining silk market last year, merchants suffered, and this year, farmers suffered alone. Most farmers are poor, so how can they withstand the huge storm. As a result, the voice of rural bankruptcy has become a topic of conversation among foreigners. (Please refer to my article "Investigation Record of Zhili Lake Silk" in the 23rd issue of the 4th volume of the Industrial and Commercial Bi-Monthly).</p>
<p>The silk market in the first half of this year was very sluggish. Overseas telegrams demanded too low a price, so old silk stopped moving forward, intending to wait and see. But in July and August, the raw silk market in Lyon, New York, and other places suddenly became active, and the price of silk rose sharply. The export of raw silk in the five countries suddenly became enthusiastic. Therefore, the trade of raw silk in our country this year, on the whole, is better than in previous years. The following is based on the latest "Weekly Raw Silk Export Report" of the Raw Silk Inspection Office to illustrate the overview of the raw silk export trade this year.</p>
<p>Year  Bales to Europe  Bales to Asia and  Bales to America  Total Exports</p>
<p>Africa</p>
<p>1930  15,197   6,691    17,694   39,582</p>
<p>1931  8,495    4,800    11,287   24,582</p>
<p>1932  9,416    8,651    7,255    25,322</p>
<p>We examine the above figures. The total number of exports this year, although not as good as in 1930, is undoubtedly more than in 1931. This is of course due to the government's efforts to promote relief, such as decisively exempting the export tax of 30 customs taels per package, and more actively allocating subsidies, calculated at 100 taels per load. In addition, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Old Factory Silk Sales Committee has been actively promoting sales to overseas markets in an organized manner, but the global recession is still shrouded, so although all parties have worked together, the effect is not very significant.</p>
<p>European countries such as France, Switzerland, and Italy have been old customers of China for hundreds of years, (Italy is also a silk-producing country, but its silk is better made than Chinese silk, so it sells it to the United States to seek huge profits, and at the same time supplements it with cheap Chinese silk,) they are quite trustworthy to Chinese silk, so orders are coming in continuously, and the export trade has an upward trend. The so-called Asia in the table actually refers to India. India is still in the hands of the British, and the industry is very young. The standard of living is relatively low, so high-quality white factory silk is not what they need, and cheap silk is in line with their tastes. According to the Zhenze silk merchants in the silk producing area, their orders are two or three bales or four or five bales at a time, rarely exceeding ten bales, but the telegrams are continuous, all year round. The biggest problem with silk is that the uniformity of the strip is not good, which is not suitable for mass production, but it is quite suitable for small-scale handicraft industry. India has not yet separated from the handicraft era, so India has become a major customer of silk.</p>
<p>However, sales have declined, and there are two reasons for this. ㈠ The country is a large-scale mechanical production, so uniformity is the most important thing, and there are very few in that can meet its uniformity of more than 80 points. Even if there are, the silk brands are chaotic and there are many names, so the number of the same silk brand is relatively small, and the order of two or three hundred bales each time is naturally difficult to pay. The lack of so-called standardization (Standardization) is the first reason. ㈡ Japan, in view of this situation, took the opportunity to seize the US market, and strove to improve all products, and must be in line with the needs of the United States. At the same time, it spared no effort in promotion and publicity, so 95% of the total raw silk consumption in the United States is occupied by Japan, and the remaining few are small numbers. Japan adopts a consolidation policy, which is the second reason.</p>
<p>Although this year is still in the midst of the global economic panic, the government and the public have been able to save the dying life to the greatest extent. From this point of view, if human power can be exhausted, the natural trend cannot be reversed. In the future, we should pay attention to ㈠ the problem of production technology, and ㈡ the problem of rational distribution. I will discuss it again.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Soviet Russia's Consumer and Production Cooperative Enterprises <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Bingzhong</p>
<p>Lenin said, "[Only] cooperation and electrification can build socialism," and also said "[The] bright cooperative system allows the public to manage the means of production, allowing the proletariat to overcome the bourgeoisie, which is the socialist system." This is the reason why Soviet Russia's cooperative enterprise is expanding so vigorously.</p>
<p>When it comes to Soviet Russia's cooperative enterprise, we should of course first analyze its purpose. We know that every country in the world now has cooperative organizations, and their purpose is to sell products to maximize the profits of their members, or to allow members to buy goods at the lowest prices. It can be said that the establishment of cooperatives is entirely for the sake of its members. However, this is not the case with Soviet Russia's cooperative enterprise. Although cooperatives inevitably seek benefits for their members, the benefits of members are only the secondary purpose of Soviet Russia's cooperative enterprise. Its main purpose is to use it as a tool to reform the economy and society, so that it can conform to the plans and principles of the Russian political party. Therefore, rather than regarding Soviet Russia's cooperative organization as a part of the world's cooperative movement, it is better to call it an organ of the Soviet socialist system. Because it recognizes that cooperative enterprise is a tool for reforming the social economy, the Soviet Union's cooperatives are completely controlled by the Party, just like industry, trade, banking, and other enterprises are controlled by the state. The staff members inside the cooperative, the policies of the cooperative, etc., are all controlled by the Party.</p>
<p>There are many types of cooperatives in Soviet Russia, but the two most important are consumer and production cooperatives. They are now described separately below.</p>
<p>(A) Consumer Cooperative Enterprise</p>
<p>Consumer cooperative enterprise is the most important of all cooperative enterprises. In the fiscal year 1929 to 1930, the number of people in the cooperative reached 40,258,000, accounting for 24.8% of the total national population. All Soviet citizens who have not been deprived of their civil rights are eligible to become members. In theory, people are free to join or not. However, in reality, non-members face various disadvantages, such as restrictions on purchasing goods and higher prices. Therefore, the current trend is that almost everyone is becoming a member.</p>
<p>The shares of members were originally fixed. In 1924, they were set at five rubles. However, in recent years, the collection of shares has been based on the salary of the purchaser of the shares, that is, the amount of one month's salary is used as the amount of the shares, which is paid in installments. Even if members have already paid their shares, they must make up for this amount. This increases the burden on the people, but to preserve the various benefits of membership, the number of people joining the cooperative continues to increase. In the fiscal year 1928 to 1930, the shares had already increased to 100,000,000 rubles. Dividends are not distributed on a regular basis, because each member only has one share, and the dividend amount is extremely small, so there is no need to add a lot of trouble to the bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Consumer cooperative enterprise can also be divided into several parts: (1) Rural consumer cooperatives, (2) Urban worker consumer cooperatives, (3) Transportation worker consumer cooperatives. Each cooperative establishes several stores, and each store is interconnected, just like the Chain Stores in the United States.</p>
<p>The Central Purchasing Union, Centrosoyuz, is jointly organized by various consumer cooperatives. Its duties are extremely heavy and can be roughly divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Representative organ of consumer cooperatives, and can also be said to be the leader of consumer cooperatives.</p>
<p>(2) Establish warehouses to store goods for each store.</p>
<p>(3) Set up machines to manufacture consumer goods such as bread, canned food, and soap for the use of the entire city's population.</p>
<p>(4) Purchase goods from foreign countries. The Central Purchasing Union now has the exclusive purchasing right for Soviet Russia's tea trade.</p>
<p>(5) Assign technical personnel to each cooperative and organize the accounting system of each cooperative.</p>
<p>(6) Provide financial assistance to cooperatives with weak strength.</p>
<p>Currently, the import of consumer goods into Soviet Russia is completely controlled by the Central Purchasing Union, which is sold by cooperative stores. The most important part of this is the catering department. The newest Soviet Russian residences do not have equipment or places for individual families to cook, so public restaurants and city kitchens are established in large numbers. These restaurants are all established by cooperatives.</p>
<p>The most important administrative department of the consumer cooperative system is the Party. This system is not jointly managed by members, but is completely controlled by the Party. Management personnel are also elected by the members, but the people elected must be within the list of candidates listed by the Party.</p>
<p>(B) Production Cooperative Enterprise</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's production cooperative enterprise is also very developed. We know that Soviet Russia's first Five-Year Plan was successful, and the progress of industry has been rapid. At least part of this credit should be attributed to the domestic production cooperatives. It can be said that there are three purposes of Soviet Russia's production cooperatives. The first purpose is to bring domestic small-scale industries into the orbit of socialism. Soviet Russia's industry takes a state-owned policy, so it does not allow the existence of independent factories or workers. They believe that when factories or workers are independent, they are all thinking of their own interests, and the road they take will inevitably conflict with the development of socialism, so they must find a way to eliminate them. The method of elimination is either to merge them into state-owned industries, or to organize cooperatives to socialize them. The second purpose is to solve the unemployment problem with production cooperatives. The more production cooperatives there are, the more developed industry will be, and the more workers will be added. This is a very obvious fact. The third purpose is to solve the problem of commodity panic. Of course, the first of these three purposes is in the most important position.</p>
<p>Production cooperatives also accept members as much as possible. In theory, whether to join or not depends entirely on the individual's freedom. However, in reality, non-members face various disadvantages. In January 1930, the government issued an order prohibiting the supply of raw materials to non-cooperative members and the purchase of their living products. In this way, non-members simply have no way to live, so they joined the cooperative one after another. On October 1, 1929, the number of members of production cooperatives reached 1,460,000. In the same year, the total value of goods produced by domestic production cooperatives was 2.424 billion rubles. The extent of development can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The basic unit of the production cooperative organization is called [Artel]. There is no limit to the number of members, whether it is five or six people, or more than a thousand people. The administrative organ is a committee, and the committee is usually made up of three people, one of whom is the chairman. Their duties can be divided into the following four types:</p>
<p>(1) Plan the sale of goods.</p>
<p>(2) Act as a representative of the Artel.</p>
<p>(3) Purchase raw materials.</p>
<p>(4) Manage all daily administrative matters.</p>
<p>The workers (that is, members) inside the Artel also have wages, which are paid either weekly or monthly, or calculated according to working hours. The amount of wages varies, but there is a maximum limit. No matter what, each worker cannot earn more than 500 rubles per month, nor can they earn more than the wages of the same type of work in state-owned enterprises. If there is to be a large profit, the Labor Exchange will have to find a way to add workers to this to share their wages.</p>
<p>Members of the Artel must pay a share fee. There is a minimum limit for the share fee. People with sufficient strength must contribute more when needed to give to the Artel. There is also interest on this type of lending, about 8% to 10%. If a member is unable to pay the share fee, they may temporarily not have to pay, and it will be gradually deducted from their weekly wages, about 5% to 15% each time, depending on the amount of wages. Profits are not distributed to members, but are used for the following four purposes:</p>
<p>(1) 25% is used as a special capital fund and deposited in the All-Russian Cooperative Bank to lend to other cooperative enterprises.</p>
<p>(2) 10% is paid as income tax.</p>
<p>(3) Fund for the development of the company itself.</p>
<p>(4) Build clubhouses to improve the lives of workers.</p>
<p>The Artels in various places are united to form local production cooperatives. These local cooperatives jointly organize a production cooperative, the United Congress, as a design and guidance agency. There is also an organization called the All-Russian Production Cooperative Federation, which specializes in purchasing raw materials, allocating bank credit, and selling products.</p>
<p>In conclusion, after discussing the consumer and production cooperative enterprises of Soviet Russia, we know that the cooperative enterprise of Soviet Russia is a tool to promote socialism, and everything is controlled by the Party. This is a fundamentally different point from the cooperative systems of various countries, and it is also a point that we should pay special attention to. Of course, the types of cooperative enterprises in Soviet Russia are not limited to this. For example, there are cooperative organizations for household chores, hunting, and hairdressing. In particular, agricultural cooperation is also very developed, but its importance is not as great as that of consumer and production cooperation, so this article does not mention it in general.</p>

<h3 id="e226">A Review of the Yarn and Cotton Market in the Past Year (Part 1) Mountain <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Last year (in 1932), cotton yarn prices were highest in the spring. At that time, due to the invasion of Shanghai by the brutal Japanese, all industries were at a standstill, most yarn factories were shut down, production decreased sharply, standard yarn auctions were suspended one after another, old transactions were all settled and cleared, and the boycott movement was particularly fierce. However, in a corner of South China, there was still demand for spot yarn, but the spot goods on the market were extremely scarce, especially for fine yarn, and prices rose as a result. Therefore, in February and March, the price of 42-count Ren Zhong yarn was 343 taels and 5 qian, the price of 32-count Ren Zhong yarn reached 255 taels, and the price of 20-count Ren Zhong yarn reached a maximum of 188 taels, which was the highest price in recent years. However, how could this situation last? After the armistice agreement was signed and the Japanese army began to withdraw, all yarn factories resumed work, and standard yarn auctions also resumed business on May 2nd. (The standard has been revised to 20-count Ren Zhong from 16-count coarse yarn due to the evolution of the times.) The price on the first day was 154 taels and 5 qian. At that time, due to the financial contraction after the war, the decline of silkworm cocoons, the collapse of the countryside, and the cessation of yarn sales in the interior, coupled with the communist disaster in Jiangxi and Fujian and the banditry in Hubei and Henan, which spread more and more, yarn sales became more and more sluggish. In May and June, the market was still difficult to stabilize and went straight downstream, showing a state of being out of control. The lowest price of standard yarn was 138 taels and 3 qian, and the price of 20-count Ren Zhong yarn (spot goods) was 152 taels, which was a difference of 36 taels compared with the high price in the spring. In July and August, US cotton was affected by humid weather and excessive rainfall, which was not conducive to cotton fields, and the Lausanne Conference Convention was signed, and world commerce was expected to turn around, so the market rose rapidly, from 5 fen to 6 fen. This led to speculative activities. Rongxing Company and Yong'an Factory in this city turned from short to long, with a quota of 26,000 to 27,000 bales. At the same time, in terms of spot yarn, the Guangdong Gang's Mingde Dehao was searching the market very actively, and the standard yarn price rose sharply, from over 138 taels to 147 taels and 148 taels. On August 8th, the US cotton government's estimate was released, and it suddenly rose 85 points (US cotton spot goods) to a maximum of 9.2 cents. With the help of this foreign cotton, the standard yarn price rose irresistibly and reached 158 taels. However, as the market price rose, it hindered actual sales, and Japanese merchants used dumping tactics. Moreover, who would have expected the second US cotton estimate to have an unexpected change, plummeting more than 100 points, causing great shock to the world's people. The standard yarn also plummeted and crashed, and it was unbearable to look back. Gradually after reaching autumn, sales were still depressed. Although the year was abundant, the prices of agricultural products were low, and the lives of farmers were still poor. The accumulated stock of yarn in Shanghai reached more than 110,000 bales, and the market fell further. The buyers also suffered heavy losses. At the end of November, the standard yarn was again 138 taels, which was 3 qian lower than the lowest price in mid-June. In December, cotton rose in price due to the rise in gold prices. The source of cotton was lacking, and the market price rose, which caused the sluggish yarn market to rise by 4 taels to 5 taels. At the end of the year, the war in Sichuan was quelled, and there was some buying for futures. The market situation turned around again. In January, the price even reached 146 taels and 2 qian, and most people predicted that there would be a new atmosphere in the red market this year. Therefore, the market situation became more and more upright. However, the bottom goods are getting thicker every day, foreign aggression is becoming more and more urgent, the economy is drying up, and the world cotton industry is still in decline. The economic situation in Europe and the United States is not optimistic, so what will the future be like? It is not difficult to predict. The following table shows the high and low prices of standard yarn and the monthly delivery prices and total transaction volume throughout the year.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the rice market concluded the old year. The source was only the 5th. Retail sales were sluggish, and warehouses continued to operate. As a result, Qingbo rice rose by one jiao. Changbang and Nangang rice went to the warehouse, and the sluggish price fell by one or two jiao. Sutongbang, Bianyin Yuan, and Duyangjian were all without a market. The rice market has stopped selling because the end of the old year is approaching.

<p>The sales of artificial silk in this city are still difficult to progress. During the general settlement period, credit is extremely tight.

<p>The price of various white coal cargoes rose significantly last week due to the war. However, the market suddenly fell back in the past two days. The reason is that there have been very few wholesale transactions in the market recently. Only the retail sales of each store are still large, but the number is not large. Yesterday, the market opened with only more than 380 tons. The price of Shanxi coal returned to Xiaowu Qian and sold for 16 taels and a half. The price of Hongqi coal returned to Xiaoer Qian and a half and sold for 18 taels. The price of Haifeng returned to Xiaoer Qian and a half and sold for 19 taels and 2 qian and a half. However, the price of Liujiang Great Wall coal has not changed.</p>

<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>Rich and Poor</p>
<p>Shanghai is the richest place in China. After years of war, China has gradually absorbed the domestic wealth into the concessions. Roughly speaking, the population in the concessions always increases after each political change. The warlords of China are truly great contributors to the flourishing of the concessions, and they create all opportunities to expand the concessions.</p>
<p>The resident pensioners who can live in Shanghai for a long time are probably families above the middle class. When they come, they bring all their movable property with them. The robbers in Shanghai are really ferocious. It is really unsafe to put foreign money at home, so it is better to deposit it in the bank. To meet so many needs, the banks in Shanghai have suddenly increased.</p>
<p>Apart from the newly opened ones, the existing banks have also added many branches. We see bank branches open everywhere we go. Therefore, some people predict that in the future, banks may even reach the point of setting up stalls.</p>
<p>If banks have more deposits than loans and are constantly paying interest, there is a danger of "swelling to death." Shanghai has money but no one to use it. Is this not a sign of people being rich?</p>
<p>However, opposite the bank stalls, next door, we often find a few small pawnshops with the big character [pawn] on their signs. Although there are many banks, they are still not even one-millionth of the number of small pawnshops. Although the business of banks is good, the business of pawnshops is even better because we know that Shanghai is the richest place, but also the place with the most poor people. In particular, there are many people who are rich in appearance but poor in reality, these people are even worse off than the truly poor.</p>

<p>— Jiang Ping</p>
<p>Where is the Land of Happiness?</p>
<p>These days, because of the aggressive behavior of the expansionists, the residents of Beiping have been leaving in droves, changing location for the best.</p>
<p>Recalling what happened a year ago, how many families were destroyed by the war. The residents of Shanghai thought that they would not suffer this fate. The people of the entire three northeastern provinces were victimized, and the residents of Shanghai thought that they would not follow in their footsteps. But what is the reality? The result is that they suffered the fate and followed in their footsteps. But now, if the residents of Beiping regard the concessions as safety deposit boxes and the interior as the land of happiness, how do they know that they will not repeat the same mistakes in the future? Look, people are advancing step by step, and we are retreating step by step. May I ask, once you have retreated to the coast, where else do you want to retreat to? Therefore, the safety deposit boxes or the land of happiness now may become chopping boards in the future, and we will all become fish and meat?</p>
<p>Therefore, today, the idea of changing location for the best is no longer appropriate, and the mentality of indifference should be eliminated. We cannot willingly make sacrifices, nor can we consider "retreating three times to"</p>

<p>丨What Do Our Countrymen Think?丨</p>
<p>[Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle.] This seems to have become a mere platitude. However, although we Chinese are fluent in reciting these words, we rarely put them into practice. For example, when studying a certain science, we Chinese only need to go abroad for two years, grasp a bit of superficial knowledge, and immediately return home to act as experts and specialized scholars. If you really delve into it, although their knowledge may not be that profound, their fluent foreign languages are enough to silence you. This phenomenon is evident in the field of science, but whether we have truly achieved the level of "knowing our enemy" in other areas is only known to heaven.</p>
<p>However, foreigners have established churches throughout the interior of our country, even in some villages. Academic exploration teams and scientific investigation teams frequently visit our country several times a year, scouring the mountains and fields. What is the purpose of this? It is simply to "know their enemy."</p>
<p>Recently, a friend from Sichuan sent me a Sichuan newspaper, which contained a piece of news that shocked me: foreigners at the West China University in Chengdu have been using large sums of money to search for many local gazetteers in the old bookstores of Dongyu Street, and have also sent people to various counties to collect them, translate them into foreign languages, and send them back to their home countries. It is said that this work has been going on for a long time. Furthermore, some Chinese students at West China University are willingly acting as foreign slaves and helping with the translation.</p>
<p>What is the reason for foreigners translating our local gazetteers? This reminds me that we often have to go to Japan to translate Chinese literary history. It is especially absurd that Chinese students are helping foreigners translate local gazetteers. No wonder we are helpless when imperialists invade China.</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, I wonder what our countrymen think when they hear this news?</p>

<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>丨Everyone Should Believe In It丨</p>
<p>In this era of "isms filling the world," we, in this great Republic of China, "dare not lag behind others in isms." All kinds of imported isms are readily available, in every form and variety. Look, capitalists, nationalists, communists, anarchists, fascists, and other ism-ists are as numerous as stars in the sky, making one wonder what they are all about. All these isms have their own principles and reasons, no matter how thoroughly opponents attack them, believers stubbornly uphold them. Being of limited knowledge, I cannot fathom the profound depths of various isms, but after careful consideration, I have invented a "Dining-ism."</p>
<p>What is "Dining-ism"? "Food is the first necessity of the people," as the saying goes. No matter who it is, from the highest-ranking elder to the idle rich, from us literary beggars who live by our pens to the beggars who ask for money, there is no one who can stop eating. Therefore, eating is the most important thing in life. People in ancient times said: "Starving to death is a small matter, losing one's integrity is a big matter." In fact, those who said this were never in danger of starving to death, so they could afford to say such frivolous words. If starving to death were a small matter and eating were not a big problem, then who would be willing to become a robber and risk their life for food?</p>
<p>Honestly, everyone wants to live. To maintain life, besides the air that heaven provides without cost, there is eating. Becoming a traitor, a profiteer, a robber, or a corrupt official, all so-called heinous acts, are ultimately motivated by the need to eat or to obtain the means to eat, in order to sustain life. The goal of capitalists is to solve the problem of eating. The goal of communists is also to solve the problem of eating. Every manufactured or imported ism is ultimately aimed at solving the problem of eating. Therefore, I say that "Dining-ism" is something that everyone, without exception, should believe in and worship. If there is someone who does not acknowledge themselves as a believer in "Dining-ism," then they must be an inhuman monster with supernatural abilities.</p>
<p>Good Policy.</p>
<p>In times of trouble, there is no hope of survival unless we find a way out by confronting the enemy! Friends, we must concentrate our strength, unite ourselves, stand tall, exert our efforts, and move forward together to forge a path to survival from despair! We do not necessarily have to exterminate the Huns, but we must drive them away!</p>

<p>— Hu Tiwei</p>
<p>These impressions made Hongye feel even more uneasy than when he had received the letter from his brother. Although the coal-guzzling, black-smoke-spewing monster (the train) tirelessly fulfilled its "extra fast" mission, Hongye was still dissatisfied, wishing he could step directly into C Village and see his father's thin cheeks and white-haired forehead. But reality did not allow it, and with a whistle, he finally disappeared with a group of laughing young men and women into a small hotel near the station.</p>
<p>As soon as his head hit the pillow, a group of what Shanghai people call "rich bugs" lined up to greet him, and he had to struggle to open his drowsy eyes and do his best to deal with them. It is said that "rich bugs" are a special product of the metropolis of Shanghai. C Village is rarely found. It seems that C Village is lucky to be connected to the land of wealth by train, so they also enjoy the privilege of being stationed here. After fighting for a while, he felt that he really could not resist and it was better to be polite and let them invade. Suddenly, a figure flashed in front of the bed, and Hongye jumped up!</p>
<p>"Sir, do you want to call someone to play with?"</p>
<p>"Get out! Lock the door for me!"</p>
<p>"This kind of thing is even more sinful than rich bugs and should also be killed," Hongye thought angrily, and got up to lock the door.</p>
<p>When he woke up the second time, he didn't know what time it was. There was a banging and knocking outside the door!</p>
<p>"Who is it? What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Sir, open the door. Room inspection."</p>
<p>Hongye opened the door, and the bellboy he had previously seen was leading four imposing policemen. The one in front was holding a circulation book.</p>
<p>"What is your surname? What is your name? Where are you from? Where are you going?"</p>
<p>He asked four questions and then waved his hand and left. Hongye looked at the watch beside his pillow, and it was exactly 2:15. He was even more angry. Is this protecting public security or disturbing travelers? Suddenly, a thought flashed through his mind and he understood. Ah! Perhaps this is a small retribution for my reluctance to spend money to call someone.</p>
<p>During this short journey, since the Creator was unwilling to grant him a sweet dream, he no longer lingered. In the dim dawn, he continued his journey on the yellow train to C Village. After crossing the C River, where sandy sails and a crescent moon remained, he hurriedly boarded the first long-distance bus. He remembered that he often saw news in the newspaper about accidents involving long-distance buses in C Village, causing injuries and deaths. Either the bus overturned into a rice field, or it jumped into the river. It is said that the drivers on this provincial highway all have a touch of official air. Being called "drivers" (駕駛員) rather than the "motorcar drivers" (汽車夫) that people in Shanghai mention, of course, has a distinction. First, they do not want "tips" (克門沙). If a guest gives them a tip, not only will they not accept it, but they will be offended and consider it a malicious insult! This refers to a chartered car hired by an individual, which costs eight yuan and eight jiao. (2)</p>

<p>"The shape of a car and the appearance of a turtle are very similar." This was advocated by William Stout, a famous American design expert. Because the shape of a turtle is a "parabola," a streamlined body can reduce air resistance. No matter how strong the wind blows against the turtle, it can move quickly. Cars also need to reduce the air resistance they face when traveling on the ground, so they should be manufactured according to the shape of a turtle.</p>
<p>(1) When the wind blows towards the turtle</p>
<p>(2) When the wind blows towards the car</p>
<p>Then, the turtle can be said to be a model for automobiles. As the saying goes, when a turtle races against a rabbit, the rabbit cannot catch up with the turtle. This is because it has no air resistance. Recently, scientists, based on this principle, have also imitated the shape of turtles when manufacturing bullets. This is to reduce air resistance during launch, so that it can shoot very far. If you look at the diagram above, you will naturally understand.</p>

<p>The food we eat every day provides us with the energy for activity when we are young. How exactly does this happen? This is what we should understand. Because the food we eat every day can help our bodies develop. But after a day of exercise [which is what it means to live a day], we also consume a considerable amount of energy. (Our daily activity requires about 2,000 calories.) The dynamization of food is explained below:</p>
<p>Rice | One bowl, weighing about 150 grams, has about 220 calories, which can raise a weight 120 feet high.</p>
<p>Tofu | One block, weighing about 200 grams, has about 120 calories, which can raise a weight 72 feet high.</p>
<p>Egg | One, weighing about 60 grams, has about 96 calories, which can raise a weight about 65 feet high.</p>
<p>Milk | One 合 (gé, a unit of volume, about 180 ml), weighing about 185 grams, has about 130 calories, which can raise a weight 73 feet high.</p>
<p>Peanuts | 100 grams, has about 590 calories, which can raise a weight 324 feet high.</p>
<p>Beef | 100 grams, has about 130 calories, which can raise a weight 78 feet high.</p>

<p>"Old Zhou! You are really too busy. Fortunately, your body is still strong; otherwise, others would not be able to handle it."</p>
<p>"Alas! My body is getting weaker every year. Recently, I often feel dizzy and have back pain. I want to take some medicine, but I don't have the money. Just think, this monthly salary of thirty yuan has to cover my own food, clothing, and the living expenses of my parents, wife, and children. I am always in poverty and labor, how can I not get sick!" Old Zhou's voice trembled a little.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of any appropriate words to comfort him for a moment, so we both kept silent for the time being. Quietly listening to the mournful sound of the rain outside the window, it increased the sorrow in our hearts.</p>
<p>"Didn't you say a few days ago that you were going to Haimen? The treatment there should be better, right? Have you received a letter?" My thoughts turned to his letter again.</p>
<p>"Yes, I received a letter from a friend today. He said that the school authorities there dare not hire people with socialist ideas."</p>
<p>"Do they know that you have socialist ideas? The standard for hiring teachers is really too bizarre; ideas are kept in each person's mind, who can prove who has them or not? It's really exhausting!" I couldn't help but feel a little angry when I heard this strange information!</p>
<p>"Even if they hire me, I won't go. The school authorities like that must be fools."</p>
<p>"Yes! The oppression of the spirit and the oppression of matter are equally unbearable for us!"</p>
<p>"I would rather suffer the oppression of matter." Old Zhou resolutely expressed his attitude towards dealing with reality.</p>
<p>"Then what are you going to do?" I asked him urgently about his plan.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to teach anymore; I'm going to become an outlaw." He raised his head, his attitude was very firm!</p>
<p>"Become an outlaw? Become an outlaw?" I was stunned, but at the same time, I seemed to have received an unexpected revelation.</p>
<p>"Yes, become an outlaw! Only by becoming an outlaw!" As Old Zhou said this, his eyes closed tightly again, and his lips flickered slightly.</p>
<p>I didn't want to ask him any further, so I quietly walked out.</p>
<p>The night outside the door was as silent as death, without a single ray of light, only the sound of dripping rain and whistling wind could be heard. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e241">One Year After the Bloody Battle <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>If the "September 18th Incident" in Shenyang was like a bolt from the blue, then the bloody battle in Shanghai on "January 28th" was like a storm? Now it has been a year since "January 28th," and the whole of China is still in the dark and suffocating atmosphere before the storm, and the whole world is stepping up its arms, waiting for an opportunity to break out. The god of war is grinning!</p>
<p>We recall the Shanghai bloody battle at that time, the great fire burned down the prosperous Zhabei, the shells swept the Jiangwan and Wusong training grounds, the wounded soldiers and refugees in the concessions were crammed everywhere, the capitalists worried about government bonds and coupons turning into waste paper, worried about the forever falling land prices in Zhabei, the small merchants in the interior frowned because Shanghai "money houses were not connected," and the farmers along the railway line painfully watched their fields being encircled as airfields, and trenches being dug. The big people and gentlemen were busy arranging alternate capitals, land capitals, and provisional capitals, wishing they could step onto the highest peak of the Himalayas: 丨丨We now close our eyes and recall the memorable, lamentable symphony of that era at this time last year!</p>
<p>But what is Shanghai like a year later? The Northeast Refugee Relief Art Exhibition closed in the cheers of "Flower Selection." The Zhabei Disaster Area Reconstruction Lottery is heavily advertised with a first prize of 390,000 yuan. Several new cinemas have opened in the paradise-like concessions. Department stores with big discounts are crowded with customers. Dr. Mei came to Shanghai to perform, and many people couldn't get tickets. Newly made short coats and newly made even longer cheongsams: The bustling Shanghai is still so bustling!! No, even more bustling! If it weren't for the gossipy newspapers frequently reporting that Jehol was in critical condition and that artillery fire was heard at Shanhaiguan, who would believe that our national crisis is still not over, that I do not offend others, but others offend me, and that the so-called "long-term resistance" is actually "long-term" [not] resistance!</p>
<p>Shanghai is really a peaceful world, but the Shanghai petty bourgeoisie who are kept in the dark have not forgotten the lessons of this day last year. Seeing that the Japanese Marine Corps in Hongkou is going to hold a "review," they are once again panicked and moving one after another. Respectable and pitiful petty bourgeoisie! Don't panic! Haven't you heard that Britain and France have a secret agreement with Japan that Japan will no longer harass Shanghai, and that the exchange condition is that Britain and France tacitly allow Japan's military actions in Jehol and Yuguan? The rich are much smarter than you, they know that Shanghai is a peaceful world.</p>

<p>"Go, I'll show you. I'll go to the Northeast myself!...Oh, it's sultry. It's sultry, annoying, I feel a little dizzy!" Tong said, stood up, walked to open the glass door of the balcony, stepped out, but immediately shrank back, he shivered. Sitting down at the table, he finished the wine in his glass, he asked hesitantly, "Another drink?"</p>
<p>"I think, no need. Order the food to be brought up." Fang leaned against the back of the chair. The sound of the erhu continued to come over. Below, several cars sped past with a "pop" sound.</p>
<p>Before long, several staggering shadows swayed on the wall, and the three of them finished their meal and went back.</p>
<p>When saying goodbye, Lei instructed Tong with a triumphant and teasing tone:</p>

<p>Met at a banquet. Started talking in a park. Sat side by side in several cinemas. Played the so-called "Spring Serenade" in several scarlet envelopes. Kissed, embraced, in several secret places.</p>
<p>So, fell in love. Xiaoling, seventeen-year-old Xiaoling, fell in love.</p>
<p>Knowing how to close her eyes when sleeping, knowing how to chew and swallow the food in her mouth, Xiaoling, who is so smart, can of course fall in love. She can apply lipstick, powder, wear three-inch high heels and still do the Foxtrot on the waxed floor, and after drinking a glass of wine, she can sing a Western love song in a sweet voice; such "capable" Xiaoling, "love" has already fallen from the sky, perhaps from the so-called peach-colored clouds, and is standing in front of her bed making cute faces. Why doesn't Xiaoling quickly grab it, put it by her pillow, and add a stimulating performance program to her dream? Xiaozhen fell in love; Xiaoling, fall in love!</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm in love! Did I do anything wrong?"</p>
<p>Falling in love, how could you do anything wrong. What young ladies want is "enjoyment," and "love" is also a "luxury item" for young ladies; a seventeen-year-old young lady who needs enjoyment has fallen in love, what is wrong with that? What is there to say!</p>
<p>"Xiaoling, fall in love!" At that time, I was excited, although I didn't say the so-called blessing in the end, but I was indeed wishing her so-called "successful love" with my sincere heart (if I have a sincere heart towards my friends)!</p>
<p>××××××</p>
<p>The wedding hall has been decorated to be very dazzling.</p>
<p>The bride has been dressed up to look like a beautiful bride. What surprise can exist in people's hearts? Those who received the invitations, of course, only went to see the wedding and drink the wedding wine happily.</p>
<p>"Congratulations! Congratulations!" I have a so-called "child and old man" friendship with Xiaoling, and in an overly happy mood, I learned the tone of the wedding mistress, bowed and bowed my hands to say a double congratulations!"]</p>
<p>"····I wish the new couple····" The marriage officiant's blessing</p>
<p>"····Next year today, greedy guests, let's eat red eggs again!" The blessing of the guest representative was not as "serious" as the marriage officiant, but it was much more interesting.</p>
<p>Since they insisted on me saying a few words of so-called blessings and speeches, I said:</p>
<p>"···Successful love! Wish you successful love! Didn't do anything wrong···" At that time, I really couldn't say anything. After saying three or four sentences in this way, both blessing and speaking, I said "I decline with thanks!" and fled off the stage.</p>
<p>Teasing the new couple in the bridal chamber, the guests pestered the new couple to describe the "love process..." Tease for a while, laugh for a while.</p>
<p>"Just say it casually!" The groom said to the bride after finishing his description.</p>
<p>"···Well, I···casually from acquaintance to love, from love to marriage!...···"</p>
<p>"What, Xiaoling!" I cried out in surprise, "From acquaintance to love, to marriage, is it so 'casual'?" "Oh! I said it wrong! What I meant was to casually talk from acquaintance to love, and then talk about marriage... Love, marriage... How could it be, how could it be 'casual'!"</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right! Hehe... Haha," At that time, I laughed loudly.</p>
<p>××××××××</p>
<p>But, yesterday, after Xiaoling went to Lawyer Kou's office and completed the negotiations for entrusting an agent to divorce her husband, I ran into her again on the way. She said: "What I did wrong was that love... marriage... was too casual!"</p>
<p>Xiaoling, is still the seventeen-year-old Xiaoling, but besides knowing everything she knew at the time, now, she also knows "casual divorce."</p>
<p>"Xiaoling! Fall in love again, marry again! It doesn't matter if it's casual! This will make your eighteen years old even smarter!"</p>

<p>Ancient works of art are loved and appreciated by everyone, but because of certain motives, some people often betray their conscience and create many fakes, attempting to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Many scientists have seen this phenomenon and deeply feel that the research on the authenticity of ancient art is urgently needed. So everyone came to study, and recently a satisfactory result has been obtained. The inventor is Mr. A.P.L. Laurie, a member of the Royal Society of Arts in England. This device uses ultraviolet light, and its shape is like an ordinary camera, making it very convenient to carry. No matter what character or painting, after being examined by it, the skills and colors of the character or painting itself can be seen, none of which can be seen by the naked eye. England has already applied this device, but other countries do not yet have it. Speaking of China, no one is studying ultraviolet light, so it is even more impossible to talk about it.</p>

<p>She pursed her lips and complained.</p>
<p>A group of young men and women were walking towards them, all gazing at them with surprised eyes. Seeing this, he quickly left her again.</p>

<h3 id="e246">On Saving the Nation <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Speaking of it, I find myself amusing. Last time I discussed selling the nation, and now I'm talking about saving it. Can a nation truly be both sold and saved? However, upon careful consideration, it's not entirely without reason. Many people are eternally infamous for selling their country, while many others are celebrated for saving it. Just as there was a Qin Hui, there had to be a Yue Fei. And Yue Fei's thinking became more evident because of Qin Hui.</p>
<p>There are many precedents, so why list them all? Therefore, my argument is not entirely without basis.</p>
<p>So, how can this nation be saved? I say: There are many ways to save the nation, it just depends on how you choose and implement them. Broadly speaking, [declarations] [telegrams] can save the nation, [Buddhist rituals] [religious ceremonies] can save the nation, [protests] [written opinions] can save the nation, [non-resistance] can save the nation, [resistance] with a vow of [long-term war] can even better save the nation, and even [the Analects] [the Doctrine of the Mean] can save the nation. On a smaller scale, [National Arts Save the Nation], [Art Saves the Nation], [fundraising] can save the nation, [opium] smoking can also save the nation, [dancing] can save the nation, and [entertainments] can even better save the nation. By extension, eating can save the nation, dressing can save the nation, sleeping, shitting, nothing is impossible to save the nation. However, when eating, you must change to eating [foreign wheat] bread; when dressing, you must wear [genuine domestic goods]; when sleeping, you must [sleep with a spear as your pillow] and [taste gall]; and when shitting, you must use a flushing toilet, otherwise, it will lose the meaning of saving the nation and will not achieve the effect of saving the nation.</p>
<p>How great and flourishing, how mighty and magnificent, are the ways to save the nation!</p>
<p>Someone might ask: "These ways of saving the nation have been practiced in our country for a long time, so why hasn't China been saved yet?" I say: This gentleman is mistaken. China has not yet perished, if people didn't exert efforts to save it, how could it be like this? And are the achievements of these great ways shallow? Moreover, it has only lost the three northeastern provinces, how can it be considered perished? Since the nation has not perished, then why save it?</p>
<p>Someone might say, "[The nation] should be saved when it is not yet perished." Therefore, the point returns to the beginning, China must be saved, there is no doubt. Furthermore, the whole country is bustling with everyone talking about saving the nation, and I, with my [patriotism, dare not lag behind others], how could I willingly stay behind in saving the nation? Therefore, when all of you are having tea and meals, it is perfectly acceptable to talk about saving the nation. However, it is not really necessary to truly put [effective] methods into practice, because at this time there are so many people selling the nation in China. Why must you imitate Yue Fei and put in effort?</p>
<p>However, the only ones who can truly save the nation are those Pullman porters, because only they can feel the pain of national subjugation.</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3 id="e247">Common Sense on Using Fountain Pens <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Lushuang</p>
<p>In the business, academic, and political worlds, almost everyone has a fountain pen. It is truly because it is convenient and also aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, even though the value is very significant, the public is willing to buy one. The pen is bought, but people don't know how to protect it. A pen that was bought in good condition soon has all kinds of problems after not much use. The wealthy go and buy another one, but those with slightly less financial leeway can only use that broken pen, blaming the pen for being bad, not knowing that they ruined it themselves. Therefore, I will record the common sense of using fountain pens to tell the readers.</p>
<p>There are many brands of ink on the market, and their compositions are different. Therefore, for a certain pen, which ink to use should not be changed. Otherwise, due to the chemical reaction of the two inks, the nib or the rubber tube will be damaged. If it is necessary to switch, it is advisable to wash away the old ink before filling with the new ink.</p>
<p>It is advisable to use high-quality ink. Inferior ink is prone to precipitation, which will block the pen tube. The ink bottle should always be tightly capped, otherwise even high-quality ink will precipitate. Users must be aware of this. Among domestic inks, the Dahua brand and the Standard brand are worth using and are not inferior to Waterman and Parker.</p>
<p>If the ink gathers at the nib when using the pen, or if the ink drips down from time to time, this is evidence that the ink in the rubber tube has run out. Therefore, the tube is filled with air, causing the pressure to increase, and the ink is forced down. If the ink is filled, this problem can be avoided, so don't panic.</p>
<p>If the ink cannot flow down, the pen can be washed with cold water, using the same method as filling the ink. The nib must be washed with cold water. Hot water will damage the color of the pen barrel and cause the rubber tube to rupture easily.</p>
<p>When the fountain pen is pulled out of the pen cap, if the pen barrel is covered with ink, then the two small holes on the pen cap must be cleared with a needle. This is because the small holes are blocked, the air is not circulating, the pressure outside the pen is small, and the ink can flow out.</p>
<p>The above are all common knowledge that pen users should know. If you follow this, a pen can be used for at least several years.</p>

<p>— Hongshui</p>
<p>After several days of snow, the sunlight has now melted it, turning this place into a muddy, unbearable road. Walking on it, boots are almost completely immersed in the mud. If one is not careful, one will be sent tumbling back. Originally, few people paid attention to it, perhaps because it was far from the city.</p>
<p>At dusk, A Gen, as usual, returned home from the factory. He put down his small basket and ran to the garden behind the thatched house to help his mother plant vegetables and water them, and to carry the loads for his mother. However, now he lost his usual calmness and could no longer live his usual leisurely life: the door was tightly closed, and through the straw cracks, he could faintly hear bursts of sobbing. He was terribly frightened!</p>
<p>The next day, the east had just revealed the fish-belly white of dawn. A Gen lazily got up, silently thinking in his heart: "Mother is freezing and sick, and no one is taking care of her. How can I have the courage to go to work? Alas! As a son, I should stay by her side and fulfill my filial duties." Therefore, he felt the sadness of being uncared for, and he also recalled the joy of his father's presence! In an instant, the factory whistle continued to sound, sound, sound. This was the last warning. For the sake of the bread problem, he had to go away reluctantly.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the thatched house was extremely quiet. Apart from the faint throbbing sound of A Gen's mother's heart, it was simply impossible to find anything to describe.</p>
<p>"Open the door... open... open." Suddenly, someone outside was hitting the bamboo fence door and shouting.</p>
<p>"See if your man speaks," a policeman in black uniform stared at A Gen's mother and asked.</p>
<p>"Sir, my husband died long ago. I only have a fourteen-year-old son, and I have no other relatives."</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Call his son here, don't be so long-winded with her." Another policeman said.</p>
<p>"Sir, what, what, what's the matter? My son is in the factory! Discuss things with me."</p>
<p>"Hmm? You are ordered to completely move out of your house today, and all the nearby thatched houses will be demolished."</p>
<p>"Why, why..." She asked anxiously, her voice trembling, but before she could finish her words, she heard two more words in her ear:</p>
<p>"What? Demolish the thatched houses!" It was a majestic and arrogant policeman shouting.</p>
<p>"Great Lord, have mercy, how can we move? I'm still sick."</p>
<p>"Heh, sick? What a joke."</p>
<p>"Sick, in pain." She said: "We are hardworking commoners. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, everyone has taken refuge here. It took almost a year of hard work to build this thatched house. If you tear it down for us, where can we go? Besides, if our house had not been destroyed in Zhabei, then why would we be so unlucky?"</p>
<p>"Too much talk? Immediately move... move... move." At the same time, two crisp slaps were imprinted on her cheeks. "Alas! We are not thieves, not kidnappers, why are you forcing us to have no way to make a living? Anyway, I'll offer you my old life..." She couldn't help but shed a few lines of bitter tears, and fainted in the mud.</p>
<p>"Get up, old woman! This is the order of the ×× Bureau, and it really cannot be accommodated. Hurry up, or we will have to do it ourselves." A more amiable policeman advised.</p>
<p>"Sir, what reason does the bureau have for demolishing our thatched houses and forcing us to move immediately?"</p>
<p>"That's right, because the thatched houses and fences [are an eyesore to the city]!"</p>
<p>"Huh? The old woman doesn't seem to care at all, she's really crazy, take her to the bureau." The majestic and arrogant policeman interjected.</p>
<p>Dusk shrouded the earth. A Gen, responding to the factory whistle, ran home with hope, only to find piles of straw and bamboo fences scattered miserably on the ground under his wooden-eyed gaze. He could no longer find his loving mother or the thatched house that could keep out the cold!</p>

<p>— Niu Ba</p>
<p>Autumn wind, this is truly a bad habit of the old customs. Although the patrons themselves feel that the amount they give to these "autumn wind" beggars is quite considerable, in their hearts, they are not very satisfied. Sometimes, on their faces, they show sly expressions, making you watch their faces. Sometimes, they even add some cold words to embarrass you. The most prevalent place for this "autumn wind" is the bathhouse.</p>
<p>"Sir, your tip is here!" Xiao Bazi presented a small basin of olives with both hands, with a smile on his face, saying "May the boss prosper!"</p>
<p>"Boss, wipe your hands with a towel!"</p>
<p>"Boss..." Xiao Sanzi and Xiao Liuzi ran over together, saying "Boss" horizontally and "Boss" vertically with smiles.</p>
<p>It turned out that in a corner of the ×× Bathhouse, an old patron had arrived. He hadn't even settled down when he was surrounded by these attendants.</p>
<p>About half an hour later, he was already getting dressed, preparing to leave.</p>
<p>"Boss, wipe your hands with the towel again!"</p>
<p>"Boss..." Xiao Sanzi ran over again, fawningly saying.</p>
<p>At this time, he took out two snow-white Yuan Shikai silver dollars from his wallet and placed them on the table.</p>
<p>"Ah! Xiao Liuzi! Two dollars!" Xiao Jiangbei intentionally shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"...Two dollars..."</p>
<p>"....!...." Xiao Liuzi ran over, grinning mischievously, looking without thanks, thinking in his heart that he was too stingy. However, friends, do you think two dollars is a small amount? If it's two dollars each, wouldn't ten be twenty dollars? Alas! Insatiable attendants! This is a bad habit of the old customs, "autumn wind!"</p>

<h3 id="e251">Inheritance Problem <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am naturally stubborn and indecisive when encountering matters. Now, because of an inheritance problem, I am indecisive. I will state the detailed situation as follows: I hope for clear instructions, and I am extremely eager for them.</p>
<p>My family is poor. My third uncle is over sixty years old. He has been working away from home for many years and has accumulated considerable wealth. However, he has no children of his own. Early in his life, he proposed to adopt me as his son, but it did not come to fruition. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), he adopted the second son of my eldest uncle as his heir. Unexpectedly, he did not cherish himself and spent his days chasing after women. My third uncle repeatedly admonished him, but the speaker was earnest and the listener was indifferent. My third uncle's heart changed because of this, and finally, in August of last year, the two sides broke up, and my third uncle drove him out. In December, my third uncle came to Shanghai to visit and intended to reaffirm his previous proposal to make me his heir. Of course, I am happy to comply with this, but I am afraid that the expelled cousin will be unwilling and will inevitably get into endless lawsuits in the future. Therefore, I am indecisive. (Remainder omitted.) Respectfully, Yan Xiangwen.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Article 1143 of the Inheritance Chapter of the Civil Code stipulates that "If there are no direct descendants, an inheritor may be designated in a will for all or part of his property, but only to the extent that it does not violate the provisions regarding special reserved portions." Therefore, Yan Jun's third uncle can, of course, freely designate anyone as the heir to his property. However, because there is a factual event of raising Yan Jun's cousin in the past, in order to avoid future troubles, the procedures must be perfect. For the plan now, Yan Jun's third uncle should quickly register the termination of inheritance (referring to Yan Jun's cousin) and the establishment of inheritance (referring to Yan Jun). This type of registration can be done with the local self-government organization. If this system of personal registration has not yet been implemented in Yan Jun's hometown, then he can also apply to the court or the county government that also handles judicial affairs for filing. At the same time, a will should be made. According to our opinion, this will should adopt a "notarized will" to be appropriate.</p>
<p>The above is just a way to solve this problem from a legal standpoint. We believe that enjoying [the blessing of inheritance] is something that a righteous man should consider shameful. If Yan Jun's third uncle insists on making Yan Jun his heir, in order to comfort the old man, of course, he cannot refuse. But do not think of this as an opportunity to make a fortune! Yan Jun should try to guide his cousin to the right path. Turning back is the shore, turning away from evil and returning to righteousness is extremely easy after receiving a great stimulus (being expelled). At that time, Yan Jun should intercede on his behalf before his third uncle and restore their relationship. Half of the third uncle's property may as well be inherited by each. This will not disappoint the elderly now, and it will also preserve the feelings of the brothers, and you will not lose considerable benefits yourself. This is the most appropriate and noblest way.</p>
<p>Finally, because it is still unknown whether Yan Jun's cousin will be determined to be good, we believe that legal procedures should still be completed as soon as possible so that you can control your rights. This is what we mean by having a foolproof plan!</p>

<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>Zhongnan had always been involved in politics, having served as several customs superintendents, and later rose to the position of director of finance. During his years in office, he earned a good fortune to bring home. The eldest uncle, Dong, guarded the ancestral property. Although he was nominally a farmer at home, he never actually set foot in the fields. He simply sat at home and ate by collecting rent. The third uncle, Xi, had passed away early. The fourth uncle, Bei, was a bookworm. The fifth, Youzhong, was studying at the law school, as a prospective lawyer.</p>
<p>Zhongnan was over forty years old and still had no son. With his wife's consent, he adopted a six-year-old child from Vietnam during his tenure in Guangdong to be a step-son. This was the Maosheng who was later expelled. At the same time, Zhongnan married a famous courtesan as a concubine.</p>
<p>This concubine was Zhongnan's old flame. Before she entered the house, Zhongnan's patrons were her benefactors!! Also wealthy guests, now welcoming her home, friends all said they were [reopening an old store].</p>
<p>Zhongnan's wife usually had extremely strict constraints, not allowing her husband to visit prostitutes outside. Therefore, Zhongnan could only sneak around to attend secret rendezvous, daring not to reveal a word in front of his wife. Someone laughed at him for having a Ji Chang phobia, but he absolutely denied it. He said:</p>
<p>"How can a dignified six-foot man be subjugated by a woman? I am not afraid of my wife, but because I feel sorry for her, I give in to her three points in everything."</p>
<p>His statement was considered by some to be a face-saving term, so he cited a fact to prove it:</p>
<p>"Five years ago, I really didn't take her seriously. At that time, I had already built a golden house outside, only because it was [not to make trouble] that I didn't notify her. Later, my lover suddenly became pregnant, and after ten months, she gave birth to a snow-white, chubby-headed son. Both she and I were eager to have children because we lacked them in middle age. Especially her, she often went to the temple to pray to the gods and make wishes, and secretly searched for good medicine formulas at a high price, playing many tricks, but in the end, she couldn't even let out a fart! Now my mistress has a son, although not born from my wife, it is still the blood of the Xia family. She must be happy to hear it. At that time, I rashly went back to tell her, and asked her to take the son and the son's mother home to live together. Who knew that when she heard the news, her face turned ashen, her eyes rolled up, and with a [thud] she passed out! After several hours, she slowly called her wandering soul back. From then on, this matter could not be mentioned again. Mentioning it to her would make her pass out for half a day, really like a death warrant. So my fear of my wife is not because I am afraid of her being too fierce, but because I am afraid of her body being too delicate and too prone to passing out!"</p>
<p>"Children's love is long, heroes' energy is short," all men who cannot withstand the play of women use this idiom as an excuse. Zhongnan succumbed to the skirt because he was afraid that his wife would pass out. Someone modified this idiom after presenting it to the couple: [The master's love is long, the mistress's energy is short].</p>

<h3 id="e254">The Economic Crisis in Hollywood <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Fulun</p>
<p>In this publication and other film publications, the wealth and extravagance of Hollywood seem to be happily talked about, so the impression given to readers is that it is paved with gold, the walls are made of white jade, and silver-gray limousines float around silently, inside which sit the deities of paradise. In reality, however, it is no longer like that. Therefore, in order to dispel readers' excessive admiration, it is necessary to introduce this article.</p>
<p>Hollywood news reporter Ms. Ningna Punam said that the content of Hollywood has an inscrutable core, but the exterior still tries to maintain the scene, unwilling to collapse. A certain French film critic also issued a shocking prediction a few days ago, saying that within six months, Hollywood would still experience a major economic and artistic collapse that could shock the world. Although we cannot be certain that Hollywood will collapse in the next six months, we can at least say that this premonition is [not without cause].</p>
<p>Ms. Ningna once visited a big star in Hollywood. He still lived in the most luxurious house on Beaver Hill. When she went inside, it was time for the hosts to dine. She saw that the food on the table did not seem very rich, but she still didn't pay much attention. Later, she saw that there were no electric lights in the house, and they were burning candles. She slowly became a little suspicious. But the host said that his wife didn't like tranquility, so he didn't turn on the electric lights. Later, she took advantage of a moment when the host wasn't paying attention and sneaked into another room, turned on the electric switch, but there was no electricity. She suddenly understood and felt a kind of creepy fear. Ah, the economic recession has actually invaded this golden-cage, nightless singing and dancing film city! She also snuck into the cellar (underground level, specially for coal stoves, pots, and cooking places), struck a match, and found that there was no gas on the gas stove either. She discovered many things: in this big star's house, not only had the electric lights and gas been cut off, but even the telephone was disconnected.</p>
<p>But he still had to live in this big house, tough it out, and still had to ride in a luxurious car. When people asked, "How are you?" he still had to put on a brave face and say, "Very well, thank you." Because if he didn't do so, he would immediately be looked down upon and would not be able to stand, so he would have to pack up his bags and scram.</p>
<p>Of course, he was not the only one affected in the same way. Many banks closed, various investments failed, and the stars who used to have solid icebergs to rely on were now penniless. In the past, they could lose their temper with the factory owners and directors, quit whenever they wanted, but now they had to humbly seek any job to do. Many had nothing to do this year, but they refused to admit unemployment and had to sit in their cars every day and stop at the door of big companies, or turn around in the photography studios. Sigh, how bitter and pitiful this is!</p>

<h3 id="e255">Two New Inventions in the Film Industry <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>

<p>Recently, a large theater has been newly built in California, USA. It is composed of two theaters, with the stage in the middle. When the show starts, both sides can enter and watch. In this way, the seats can be more spacious and not too crowded. It can also be regarded as a novel idea to use one stage to perform the functions of two theaters. The inventor is an American engineer who planned for a long time before realizing it.</p>
<p>A professor at a technical university in Germany has invented an optical device that can be used in theaters to write words on the glass screen of this machine while the movie is playing, and the words will be projected onto the screen. This provides various conveniences for reporting temporary news, current events, and important news, and celebrity autographs. At the beginning of the invention, this professor was interested in teaching extremely complex formulas in mathematics in a large classroom, and it was later used in theaters. Now many theaters have adopted it.</p>
<h3 id="e256">"Star" Company's New Production Plan <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Qingxia</p>
<p>Although the Star Company's studio doesn't have as many as Lianhua, the total number of productions last year seems to be no less than Lianhua. However, before shooting each film, they do not limit the maximum number of feet of film to be used. For example, [A Laughing Tale of Love]; [The Flower of Freedom]; etc., all used more than 30,000 feet of film to obtain about 10,000 feet of film. A seven- or eight-thousand-foot film using more than 20,000 feet of film is even a majority of their productions. Therefore, the total number of films they use each year always exceeds that of any other company. They feel that this is not a good strategy in the long run and want to implement savings immediately; however, in order to make the productions perfect, they finally dare not implement it suddenly. This also makes them extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Recently, Zheng Zhengqiu once discussed improvement measures with important employees of the company such as Zhou Jianyun because of this problem. At that time, it was decided to shorten the length of the film and increase the shooting of [cartoons]. Famous painters Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan were hired by Star to serve as the director of [cartoons].</p>
<p>[The Mysterious Little Detective] is the [cartoon] that has just started shooting, with actors such as Yi Zhiyuan and Zhang Min; the length of the film is one thousand feet. Because Star's productions will be shorter than in the past, this kind of [cartoon] is prepared to be shown with the feature film in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e257">The Group of Child Stars at Tianyi Film Company <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>Currently in the Chinese film industry, the lack of child stars and the urgency of the demand is a fact that no one can deny. Therefore, this group of female child stars nurtured at Tianyi Film Company is truly worthy of our attention! Here, the reporter specifically introduces this group of female child stars:</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun: Before engaging in film work, she was a famous little female stage performer. She has a petite and exquisite figure, a lively and clever demeanor, and is even more richly endowed with acting talent. In the current Chinese film industry, she can be considered the number one female child star!</p>
<p>Shao Suxia: She is the daughter of Shao Cunren, the assistant manager of Tianyi Film Company. She is fourteen years old this year and studies at the Municipal Bide Elementary School. She is innocent and naive, can sing and play the piano, like a lively little bird. In the silent film era, she had already played important roles in many films. She also participated in the talkies "Amusement Fair," "Battlefield," and "Orphan Girl." In the new film "Double Mandarin Ducks in a Sea of Sin," she plays the daughter of a wealthy man raised by poor people, and her performance is excellent.</p>
<p>Chen Qixia: She is the younger sister of Chen Yumei, the boss's wife of Tianyi Film Company. Lively and innocent, her singing and dancing in "Amusement Fair" left a very good impression, giving people a good impression. It is expected that she will contribute even more amazing achievements in the future.</p>
<p>Chen Jingfang: Although she is young, she has already grown as fresh and beautiful as a lotus flower. She played a maid in "Traces of Orchid Valley" and received good reviews. Some even said that her success was no less than Chen Yanyan's in "A Cut Plum." We hope that she will work harder in the future and become a famous child star.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Joan Crawford's Makeup Alert <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, and Norma Shearer are the three major pillars of MGM. Because each person has their own art and their own audience, they are constantly moving forward, wanting to seize the throne of MGM. Greta Garbo relied on her mysterious charm and finally seized this throne. Therefore, the ambitious Joan Crawford engaged in fierce competition against Garbo, wanting to snatch the throne from Garbo's hands. Now that Garbo has returned to her native Sweden, the throne of MGM has also been taken by Joan Crawford. However, the audience's support for Garbo has not diminished because of this. Our clever Joan Crawford wants to turn the audience's support for Garbo to support her. This can only be done by imitating Garbo. Therefore, she has recently imitated Garbo in her makeup, wanting to win the audience's favor. We are waiting to see in her upcoming film "Rain" (The Rain), we can see that her makeup is a bit mysterious. Those two thick lips are truly sensual enough, but although she dresses up like this, she is very concerned about the audience's criticism of her change in style, fearing that the audience will have a negative reaction to her makeup and lose her throne. Therefore, she has recently been very concerned about the audience's psychology.</p>

<p>— Huang Zhenxia</p>
<p>(II) Good Night, Vienna</p>
<p>The customs of 19th century Central Europe, the culture of 19th century Central Europe.</p>
<p>Vienna, this German-Austrian national capital, is encircled by the blue Danube River. In the early 19th century, ancient castles were heavily guarded, and the melody of waltzes floated lightly on the fine grass. It is the oldest city in Central Europe, the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, the cradle of genius musicians, and the center of Romantic sentiment. The classical beauties we see in famous paintings, with long skirts sweeping the ground and a large black mole on their faces, as well as the knights with precious swords and steeds, the so-called German Blue Cross Knights, the spirit of chivalry, crystallized into this medieval Romantic culture, and Beethoven and Schubert and others transformed its atmosphere with the sounds of paradise. Even in modern times, its position in European art still occupies the most excellent position. "Good Night, Vienna," is a musical comedy set against this "City of Dreams." The so-called "Good Night, Vienna" is a modern knight's farewell call to this "City of Dreams" on his journey. Its poignant emotion is actually the same as Byron's "Good Night, My Native Land" when he bid farewell to England. The structure of the whole film is rich in interest and extremely warm and beautiful, and can be called a by-product of the essence of Western musical art. Its attitude towards life is a lively satire against solemnity, but it still does not escape the Romantic style of medieval knights and maidens, such as the male lead must be a military officer, and the female lead must first be a flower girl and then a famous actress.</p>
<p>In short, the film highlights the beauty of Vienna's dream and its beautiful characters. This is purely a by-product of literature and art, a condiment against turning life into a solemn and serious affair, with a bit of Parisian humor. If viewed from a trendy political perspective, since Vienna is the birthplace of European feudal forces, and the characters in the play are all extremely petty-bourgeois inferiorized, without the slightest revolution, it is naturally just a "poisonous anesthetic."</p>
<h3 id="e260">Introducing the Fairy in Rainbow Garments <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ba Gao</p>
<p>The German Ufa Film Company occupies a transcendent position in the world film scene. Its productions, no matter what kind of subject matter, are all focused and fully committed, without the slightest compromise. From its "Slaying the Dragon and Encountering the Immortal" all the way to the "Dragon and Phoenix Dance" currently showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater, which one has not given the audience a wonderful and good impression while meeting the conditions suitable for film art?</p>
<p>It is said that "Fairy in Rainbow Garments" is a superior product of Ufa Company last year, on par with "Dragon and Phoenix Dance." In major European cities, it enjoys the same fame. "Dragon and Phoenix Dance" is a musical opera, and "Fairy in Rainbow Garments" is also a musical opera, but the subject matter is different, and the director's methods are different. In addition, the script of "Fairy in Rainbow Garments" is humorous, a small satire on life.</p>
<p>The depiction of the whole play is very light, cold, and has a Parisian style. It is very humorous to make fun of a small country. However, it writes about a dreamlike life, happy and sweet, succumbing to the supremacy of love, becoming the yearning of young men and women.</p>
<p>Its theme is to use the small to symbolize the big. It has absolute doubts about the monarchy. It satirizes bureaucratic politicians and soldiers. It rebukes wealthy merchants and magnates. It ridicules subordinate staff, but it sympathizes with the burning of the fire of life and the activity of youth.</p>
<p>Its English name Ronny will be released at the New Light Theater soon.</p>
<h3 id="e261">The Achievements of "Si Lang Visits His Mother" <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Hu</p>
<p>The entire "Si Lang Visits His Mother," produced by Ancient Sound Film Company, directed by Yin Shengtao, and starring the famous actors Xue Yanqin and Tan Fuying, has been completed. Xue Yanqin and Tan Fuying are both famous actors on the stage. This is their first time shooting a talkie, and their performance is as good as seasoned movie stars, which is truly rare and commendable.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the filming of the film. They took great pains for the scenery in the play, especially the magnificent imperial palace garden of the Empress Dowager Xiao, which is not often seen by the audience.</p>
<p>"Si Lang Visits His Mother" is indeed more wonderful on the screen than on the stage, because there is a great background to embellish it. In terms of the number of people and horses alone, it is several times more than on the stage, so the "Si Lang Visits His Mother" on the screen is enough to satisfy the audience.</p>

<p>— Translated by Xi Meng</p>
<p>Here, he created his own hell, but it was also here that he himself fell into the hell he created, and perished with the others who had fallen into this hell before him.</p>
<p>The Italian treasury bond was forged and has now been discovered. The transfer of 40 million yuan has also been cancelled. Dark clouds are gathering from all sides, and the net is closing down. Paul Kreuger, Eric, and all other colleagues cannot escape, and their reputations are ruined. The doors of the prison are opened wide, waiting for their arrival.</p>
<p>New York, London, Berlin, Paris, exchanges all over the world are tottering and about to fall, making earth-shattering sounds. The cabinets of many countries have fallen, and the governments of many countries have been overthrown. Revolutions are happening everywhere. People are panicked and cannot live in peace.</p>
<p>Paul returned to the office and heard the curses of the people. He truly had no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth, so he quietly fled. He sat alone at his desk, thinking that he admitted that this failure was inescapable. He suddenly had a surge of emotion.</p>
<p>All his past experiences came back to his mind one by one, swirling rapidly like a whirlpool, like scenes in a movie, reappearing before his eyes.</p>
<p>Like a novel, the cause and effect are intertwined, and he already knew the outcome in his heart, with no way to escape.</p>
<p>Finally, he opened his secret safe and took out a pistol and put it in his pocket. He quickly left his office and walked to the balcony. He thought of the past events one after another, starting with Qing Shoufu, who was squeezed out of his job in Chicago, USA, all the way to Murna telling him that she had already loved someone else 丨丨 those people who had been harmed by him, one by one stood before him 丨丨 Bei Bei, Sanya, Lodinsky, the old inventor, Scalatti, bankers, politicians, financiers from various countries... A terrifying ferocity suddenly flashed in his eyes. He raised his gun and pointed it at his own temple. In the hazy darkness, only a flash of orange-yellow light was seen, and he had already rolled over the railing from the balcony and fallen onto the street.</p>
<p>Many people heard the gunshot and chased to his office, from the office to the balcony. They looked down and were all stunned. Everyone desperately ran towards the elevator.</p>
<p>On the street downstairs, they saw his body, and each person had their own thoughts.</p>
<p>Paul's body was lying in the gutter, his head hitting the wheel of a scavenger's two-wheeled cart. Next to his heels, there was a pile of burnt matches. Eric finally said to himself:</p>
<p>[He came from digging in the gutter, 丨丨 he rose from the gutter all the way to controlling the world 丨丨 he still died in the gutter.]</p>
<p>(The End)</p>
