<h3 id="c5">汪院長報告廬山會議結果 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>充實國力與民力並與世界求合作　　）南京（中央七日晨八時、舉行九十次紀念週、到張繼·居正·汪兆銘·葉楚傖·曾仲鳴·褚民誼·谷正綱·甘乃光·及職員等·共八百餘人、居正主席、汪兆銘報告全文如下、</p>
<p>本來前星期一日、兄弟奉命出席紀念週報告、因爲當時還在由潯回京途中、所以上星期四日中央會議、再命兄弟今天出席報告、今天所要說的、是此次廬山會議的結果、</p>
<p>廬山會議的名稱、從那裏來的、就是因爲蔣委員長最近召集江西勦共軍隊的將官、分班到廬山南山下講話、予以訓練到廬山南山下的人、都會見到許多營幕、約三四千人、在那裹聽候講話、接受訓練、大家拿出所得的經騐、來謀軍事上之改進、所以這次聚會所商議的、是關於軍事技術的多、軍事委員會已將會議的結果、分别編印報告、於此不必細說、</p>
<p>至於兄弟之赴廬山、以及後來孫哲生先生繼到、並非參加軍事會議、而是對於時局作一種商榷、幾天會談之後、幾發出儉電、儉電所說的、並不是新的政策和新的方針、政策和方針是中央所已確定的儉電不過根據中央已定的政策已定的方針、說明處理時局的態度和意向而已、旣不是會議的結果、也不是什麽新的决定、原電由蔣委員長和兄弟兩人署名、其原因即在於此、關於儉電最先要說的、各報所載大致相同、但開首有一句漏去的原文、是「今日救國方策治本莫要於充實國力、治標莫急於清除共匪、蓋國力不振、由於民力不充、」而各報所載治標一句都漏去了、這是應該補正的、什麽呌做「國力」什麽呌做「民力」呢、我們可以說「國力」就是「民力」、「民力」就是「國力」用語雖有不同、内容是無甚差别的、不過「國力」指對外而言、是國家對外的力量、也就是國家對外自存自立的力量、「民力」指對内而言、是民衆的力量、如今國裏頭有兩種偏見的人、一種偏重國力忽視民力、一種偏重民力、忽視國力、偏重國力忽視民力的人以爲求國家自存自立、除了擴充軍備没有别的、他們不知道水有泉、樹有根、國力有他的來源、民力不充實、國力不會發達的只知擴充軍備、而不注意充實民力、其結果不但重工業没有一些兒發展連普通農工商業也萎靡不振、一切需用之科學的設備甚至於普通用品、都要仰給於外國、有海口的時候還可以和外國通商、萬一有事、海口被封鎖了、所必需仰給於國外的也就被斷絕了、到了那個時候、還有什麽國力可說、須知國力之發達、是科學技術發達之結果、也即是民力充實之結果、不求民力之充實、而只知道軍備之擴充是徒然的、反之、偏重民力、忽視國力、也是一樣的錯誤、中國今日所要建設的甚多、所謂輕重之别、緩急之分於百端待舉之中、不能不有一個中心以爲努力的鵠的、今日最要之圖、莫過於求國家之自存自立、一切努力、必須以此爲鵠的、所以發展民力、爲的是充實國力、如果發展民力、只是文化上之增進、物質上之享受、於國家自存自立的力量、全不注意、則物質上享受夠了、而國家之自存自立、也就不可能了、這樣的民力、在中國今日、是不需要的、有許多國家於積極充實民力之中、所謂宫室之美飲食之奉、雖也應有盡有、而於發達國力却特别注重、所以民力充實國力亦隨之而發、反之、如果只求物質上之享受、偏重民力而怱視國力、是一樣要失敗的、儉電說、國力不振、由於民力不充、民力不充、由於農村破產、工業幼稚、故商業無形凋敝、舍發達國民之生產力、則别無充實國力之道、我們今日、首要充實民力、同時以充實民力而發達國力</p>
<p>至於治標方面、共匪肆虐、患在腹心、甚至於禦侮自衛的工作、亦爲所牽制、而不能爲有效之實施、只就中央軍隊而論、受牽制的有幾十師之衆、其他再不必說、自從本年三月間、中央抽調一部精銳赴長城作戰、南昌幾於失守、及蔣委員長回鎭南昌、始保無虞、其後西路剿匪總司令何鍵南路剿匪總司令陳濟棠相繼就職、剿匪軍事形勢纔較爲開展、所以江西共匪實在是腹心之患、共匪一日不清除、則不但充實民力發達國力、皆無從着手、就是緊急禦侮自衛的工作也做不到、治標莫急於清除共匪、是無論何人都不會有異議的、</p>
<p>儉電原文、還有兩段要補充說明幾句的、一是借欵問題、一是察哈爾問題現時國内外對於經濟援助與技術合作、</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>發生誤會、其要點不外以下三者、</p>
<p>（一）以爲損及主權開共管之漸、其實輕清援助、已成立者、不過美國棉麥借欵、核其内容、不但與政治無關係、即就商業來論、亦只是貨物賒貸的性質、如何會損及主權、外間揣測、以爲除棉麥借欵之外、還有其他各種借欵、甚至說有新銀行團之組織、須知道四國銀行團五國六國銀行團、在前清爲亡國之原、在民國亦爲大亂之媒、如何可以經易成立、據宋部長來電證明、此說全屬子虚烏有、至於國聯技術合作委員會、據宋部長來電鄭重聲明以下兩件事、其一絕對不涉政治、其二、由我國自動絕不自行提議如、此則亦何致損及主權、更與共管云云毫不關涉（二）以爲將以此促成内戰、現時西南有一部分人、即持此說、以爲民二借欵、民六參戰借欵、覆轍具在、但是此等覆轍、我等正當引以爲戒、何故躬自蹈之、中央政治會議立法院的决議均規定此項借欵用途、限於農業工業之建設、行政院根據此决議正在草擬計劃、軍事委員會亦鄭重聲明、决不以此欵移於增加軍費、增加軍費尚且不爲、更何致以此用於内戰、政府對於方針已定、將來必更有事實可以證明的、</p>
<p>）三（以爲此次借欵、會有外交作用、即利用甲之勢力以抑制乙之勢力、日本有一部分人議論以爲此仍是「以夷制夷」之辦法、我如今負責聲明、中國感於建設之需要、與物質之缺乏、確有與世界各國增進經濟與技術之關係的决心、此在中國爲自存自立計固應如此、而在世界各國爲共存共榮計、亦决不認爲非策、但我們有自知之明、在現時積弱的形勢之下、一切聯甲制乙等等政策、無論爲合縱爲連橫、都不足以擾人、而適足以自擾、我們痛感於國力不振、不但不能與人言抵抗、且亦不能與人言親善、而且我們若設有相當的國力、也决不會有人來聯我們、以對於其他的我們認定今日救國、惟具備其實力量、不存奢望、不存僥倖心、我們現時需要其實力量、是用以自救、不是用以害人、我們今日力量未足時、是如此决心、他日若幸而有力量充足之一日、這决心也是不變的、</p>
<p>我們對於家事所定方案、一是不用兵、二是不放任、</p>
<p>避免内戰、不但在國難期内、應當如此、在任何時候、都應當如此、如果有其他方法可以達到目的即使較迂遠些較委曲繁重些也還是避免内戰爲是、這個理由、在「以建設求統一」的論文中已經說明但是因爲避免内戰的原故、對於察事取放任主義、那就大大的不對、恐怕其結果較之内戰、更要不堪、何以呢、因爲察哈爾是邊省、因爲察哈爾是地瘠民貧的省份、以邊省而又地瘠民貧、脫離中央、何以自存、其不淪爲東三省熟河不止、所以我說其結果較之内戰更爲不堪、或者會有人駁我道、馮先生之割據察省曾經聲明、其目的在抗日、且以收復多倫爲證祗要中央取消華北停戰恊定、一同抗日、則察省自無脫難中央之虞、中央何爲而不出此、我答道、在停戰恊定以前、中央調集各處軍隊、在長城一帶、悉力抗戰、當時深知情形危急、窮於應付、曾經再三催請軍事委員、務必同在首都、共决大計、如實因職務不能分身、則務必派定負責代表前來出席、可見得當局的人、實在没有存心獨斷獨行、不去理會其他負責者的意見、及至停戰恊定成立、當局的人固然豫備以一身受各方面的責難、但是已經成立了、也就不是任何人所能隨意推翻的了、我們對於停戰恊定成立、固認爲十分痛心的事、但東三省熱河的事件、並不因停戰恊定成立而了結、我們尙需要無窮的努力、以維其後、只是努力要有整個的計劃、一致的步驟、不是一人與一隅之地可以集事的、甲午戰敗、清廷將臺灣割讓、唐景崧劉永福等、不肯承認、繼續作戰、其人其事、至爲可悲、但這是因爲清廷已將臺灣割讓了、如今政府並没有割讓東三省熱河、察省更談不到、馮先生絕不宜以唐崧劉永福自居、使察省爲臺灣之續、馮先生憤憤於停戰恊定之成立、我甘受馮先生責備、我對於馮先生唯一懇求、則在救亡圖存、宜有整個的計劃、一致的步驟、其内容如何、此時自然不能宣佈、然如馮先生以爲能收復多</p>
<p>倫、即能以同樣辦法收復東三省熱河、則我當敬告馮先生、國難至此、所需的是眞實力量、大言壯語、不但不能生出力量、反而將力量消滅、這是應該注意的、以上是對於察省事件不能放任之眞實原因、儉電所提四原則即　據於此、</p>
<p>如果有人問我、倘使不用兵即不能不放任、不放任即不能不用兵、又如何呢、我答道、祗要有其他的方法、則决不用兵、所謂其他的方法、在中央當局的人能推誠相與、在馮先生能受盡言、在全國民衆有眞實的認識正確的主張、發生出民主的力量來、制裁一切、我的注意與希望、尤在後者、</p>
<p>如今察事尚未實際解决、據馮先生世電、似乎已經使我們絕望、但是這兩三日來、又有接受儉電所提四原則之希望、而同時僞軍向多倫進攻之消息、亦在這兩三日來、最爲緊張、可見事情變化是不測的、但是無論如何、以上所述的根本觀念决不因事情變化而更改、</p>
<p>以上所說、均就儉電原意、補充說明、總而言之、今日救亡國存之道、首在充實國力、而欲充實國力舍發達國民之生產力别無他途、希望全國國民聚精會神、向此　去、儉電的根本意義即在於此一本中央已定之政策和方針、以處理時局之態度和意向公告國人、　不是新的决定（七日中央電）</p>

<h3 id="c8">西北邊防與開發西北實· <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>新疆問題在中央宣慰使黃慕松氏赴任之前·國人多具開發西北之新希望。以爲黃氏此行。必能消弭地方意見。溝通漢回間歷年隔閡。乃不料事實與理想相反黃氏一行駐新不滿一月。在其旅新時間中。迪化且發生一次政變。據一般新聞界。傳此一政變。旣非漢回爭鬭之嚴重化。又非有任何突發問題。乃純爲政治上之技術關係。致引起宣慰使與地方官吏間之誤會。遂致宣慰使署隨從人員。一律離新。宣慰使黃氏亦於不久之前。即行返京矣。依中央之判斷及社會一般之推測。皆以爲政府如任命劉文龍盛世才分領新省。則一切事態。可以相安。至少政治上之變態。不至擴大假　時日。當可徐圖補救。此說或亦可信。</p>
<p>蓋新省漢回隔閡。雖云不易求得根本上解决之道但地方遼闊。面積幾占内十八省十分之四。而交通滯阻。僅鄰近國界處與英俄諸國稍有交易一般經濟社會落後。尚在牧畜與農村經濟轉換之時期中。且人口稀少。出產雖豐富。而安於故常之心理。多於進取之意志。是故當地官吏及一般社會之領袖。亦默守數十年前舊習。在政治上則遙戴中央地方上則各自爲政。實際則並無所謂積極的野心。思向他方發展。祇圖能維持其現狀。保守其已有祿位。即爲滿足。此二十二年以來。新疆所以支持原有狀態。殆亦地勢使然也。　　然而歐洲大戰以後。世界消貨市塲縮小。原料產地有限且自一九二年經濟恐慌開始以還。資本主義國家。咸積極開闢市塲。而高原地帶又多沙磧之新疆。固不足以當市塲之選。但亦聯勝於無。蘇聯大革命後。其初僅爲社會主義的試騐。在實際上並不足以威脅資本主義各國。故新疆地位在數年前。不如現在帶有嚴重的政治性質。如所謂建立回國之陰謀。割裂我國西北之策劃。在個人方面之企圖。容或有之。公然倡議。則未之聞也。頃者蘇聯五年計劃見諸實施。土西鐵道完成。中亞細亞入其掌握。新疆回人。當然感受極度刺激。於是統治印度之英國。乃乘機而入。一則防禦回人勢力之擴大。大再阻遏蘇聯勢力之伸張。三則擴張市塲。以便已國貿易之發展。，同時日本於掠取東北四省而後。進一步以圖完全實現其所謂大陸政策。蓄意侵略内蒙。以故近日來日本密探之潛入新疆者已不下百數。則新疆地位之日趨嚴重。可不言而喻矣。</p>
<p>與新省南路緊鄰之西藏。早已機四伏。自班禪達賴衝突之時。班禪即被逼離藏束來。達賴遂盡量施行其視英計策表面上西藏固仍爲中華民國之領土。而實際統治權力。已不能達。加以四川軍閥。惟知内訌。對於旣已劃省之西康。且置之不顧。又何怪藏人之輕視乎。</p>
<p>中國處此情勢下。開發西北。實刻不容緩。而開發西北。當以開發國民經濟爲先務。惟目前之西北經濟。旣甚落後。一切均有待於東南之輔助。加以錮閉已久。宗敎政治。矛盾重重。致漢回不能合作。漢藏互不相容。今後欲圖西北之開發。積極改進舊有之經濟組織。當以鐵道交通之發展作先鋒。然後文化運動。乃得而推進一方須實行廉潔政治。解决宗敎上之歧異。一般人事問題始可循序漸進。以樹立我國家百年之大計。</p>

<p>— 傳冀之</p>
<p>國建設事業的進步，那當然要推上海爲巨　，單　就房子一項而論</p>
<p>中：從前鬼哭營照，人跡罕至的荒塚廢墟，現在矗立了矞麗巍　的高樓巨厦；從前狹窄崎嶇的街道，現在已陸續闢成平坦的柏油路，同時，兩邊湫隘囂慶的店房，也削足適履般的拆倒而翻成新的西式的建築，這光明燦爛的上海所以能有今日，我們一面固要感謝洋大人開闢租界的恩典，一面國人能奮起直追，也同樣有不可磨滅的功動。最近國際經濟恐慌的巨浪由太平洋的彼岸，波及到世界貿易塲的上海；同時，國内農村經濟崩潰的結果，也影響到這十里洋塲，以致閙着空前的商業不景氣，家家（大犧牲），日日「大減價」，「開門大吉」的，不斷地發現；然而商業實足以致富，自然有人混水亂撈魚，一面儘管「開門大吉」，一面還是有增無已的喊着「開幕誌喜」；而内地的富翁，財主，因局面不寗，也摒擋所有，來作海上逍遙的寓公，影響所及，便成「人浮於屋」的局勢，店面房也好，某坊某里的住宅也好，常告「人滿」，這樣一來，聰明的企業家，就利用機會投資於建築事業，於是東也翻造，西也翻造，把一些比較陳舊的店房，住宅，都給他們陸續拆倒，重新建築，以求適合於「繁榮市面」的原則。我的朋友S君，眼看洋涇浜墊滿而成現在的愛多亞路，當然可以稱句「老上海」，那知去秋離開此地，今夏重來，他已不認識老西門矣，卽此可見上海的日新月異了。</p>
<p>可是翻造的房屋愈多，窮朋友就愈糟糕，因爲一輩子没福住洋房，眼睜睜地看着富人们搬進去，自已給他們擠在都市生活圈以外，所以物質文明的進步，究竟該禮讚，還是該咒詛，實在煞費躊躇！</p>
<h3 id="c142">新紀錄 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 琪玲</p>
<p>這次華北運動會，男女田徑以及游泳創了不少新紀錄，這當然使我</p>
<p>們安慰不少。不過，　目下除了運動會之外，也創了不少新紀錄，這當然也値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>爲了愛情的驅使，便千方百計的以求達到目的，縱犧牲性命，在所不惜，這本已是青年們的惡習，但情敵仇視，至多謀害一人，乃最近土耳其士麥拿地方因了互爭一個絕色女子，便公然的傷害了三十五人，眞是聞所未聞，新紀錄。做了皇帝，當然管轄萬民，不再受任何的管轄了，遜清光緒雖然受着慈禧的埀簾聽政，還是受着人的管轄。近來溥儀在東北，已是傀儡，荒木竟用一最高殊動之軍犬以監督之，新紀錄。</p>
<p>我國素稱禮義之邦，對於「廉恥」二字尤爲注重，所以裸體運動，一致議决反對，但是在馬路上行動的少女，越是摩登，到有十分之四是裸着小腿，或是大腿的，外加上一件緊夾裹身，薄如蟬翼的紗旗袍，啊！馬路上可以看到模特兒，新紀錄。</p>
<p>我們貴國的軍人，對於内戰，向來注意，現在報載四川戰線竟沿長千餘里。而我們貴國的爲上的，向不顧百姓的甘苦的，聽說四川田賦竟征收到民國五六十年了。新紀錄。</p>
<p>凡事進步了才會產生新紀錄，現在如此的層出不窮，未始非好現象吧。</p>

<p>縱的方面，從上古一直到今天，横的方面，從南極到北極，東極到西極，不論是什麽大不了的大事，小得比什麽還小的小事，都不會没有「結果」的。</p>
<p>自然囉，「因」，種下了，當然要有（果），殺人，是（因），槍斃，是「果」；讀了書，做官，做了官，發財，發了財，討小婆······這都是互爲「因」「果」的事。</p>
<p>人家說：「天下無不了之事」，「了」者「結果」也，「不了」者「無結果」也，所以，天下絕無「無結果」的事。</p>
<p>但是，不在定理範圍内的有個例外，中國，就是倒外，在中國，「果」是很少，「無結果」而散的把戲很多。</p>
<p>大會决議案，三年計劃，五年計劃·····這是不會有「結果」的。總之··中國人只有「因」，不會有「果」的；唉！中國的「結果」很少，將來就免不了要大大的結一個「果」呢。</p>

<p>在今年春末的時候，不知那裹一位天文家，據他的觀測說是：「本年無夏季，」居然還在新聞紙上宣露出來，那時候，有兩種哀樂不同的人，大發其議論，抱悲觀者，當然是屬於一般靠冰淇淋，酸梅湯，杜製汽水····的一般小販，以及冷飲店的大老板，他們想：「該是命軍註定，今年天如不熱，少一批進欵，如何是好，」抱樂觀者當然是屬於一般畏熱如虎的人，他們想：「今年無夏季，倒是叨天之福，在夏天的消費可以大减外，倒還可少出些汗液呢？」那裹知道事實是事實，一些兒也不能勉强，現在的氣候如何？據說：「有幾天，竟熱到百度以上，這樣看起來，那位天文家，彷彿和纒夾二先生看錯了隔年歷本一樣的錯誤了，可笑可笑！南京路的地面，比較了其他的路來得寛闊，可以受熱力也比較來得高强，路面柏油，經過猛烈陽光的蒸曬，會溶化了成功膠狀，雖然有工部局的細沙灑在上面，一般「自食其力」的人力車夫，還拚命的掙扎，很快捷的奔跑着，有一天我曾看見一個人力車夫，暈倒在路上：圍觀着的不少，都没有辦法！</p>

<p>夏季大廉價，特别大减價，照本脫售，乂乂大賤賣·····等不同樣的旗幟，在南京路上有許多可以看到，大公司的買主們，男男女女的依然很多很多，他們似乎不怕熱，手裏還要提着買了的沉重的東西。</p>
<p>上等的冷飲店，除了外人所開辦的，我們中國人的也有不少，它們每家的營業，據說：「要超過往年」，天文家眞騙人，竟會：「適得其反」，於是大老板呵呵地笑起來了。不過苦了一般怕熱的人，呌苦運天。</p>

<p>第十三回　棄職見知音佳人默許承家得來者健兒狂歡　　趙自强有了那一番經歷之後，他發現了軍人生活，究竟是可以厭倦的。而且把算盤仔細打一打，也極是不合算。所以到了連部裏，找着上士王士立，就討論這件事。王士立忽然聽到說連長要辭職了，這倒不由得大爲驚異一下，望了他的臉，許久，許久，說不出一個字，趙自强正色道：眞個的，我不幹了。要說一個大兵想不幹，不容易脫身，我一個連長不幹了，想這個位子的人，有的是，還怕走不了嗎？王士立道：這不結了？想幹連長的還多着呢，爲什麽把現成的連長倒丢了不幹？你私地裏和知已的朋友商量商量罷。咱們私下說一句話，由兵士爬到連長，這就費大了勁，你若是不幹了，以先吃那幾年苦，都有些莫明其妙了。要是知道爬到連長還没有意思，壓根兒就不該來抗槍桿。這三言兩語，倒說得趙自强回不出個二來，停了許久才道：以前來抗槍桿，那是以前的心眼。現在不願抗槍桿。是現在的心眼。王士立究竟是地位低一些的人，聽他如此說着，不敢向下追問了，只好向他陸績的微笑着。趙自强由家裹走向苑來的時候，他是一個人想着他一個人的理，只想到這連長職位所掙來的錢，太不能有什麽作爲了，而且也不如挑桶賣菜的，還可以享那家庭之樂。人生在世，都爲着什麽呢？就爲令這樣聽着軍號响起床，聽着軍號吃飯來的嗎？他一個人越想越理由充足，恰是不曾有一個反面的感想，來攔阻他一下。這時王士立雖是輕描淡寫的說了兩句，可是仔細想來，他的話也有理由，一個抗槍桿的人，爬到了當連長，那實在是不易，如今辭職不幹了，豈不是前功盡棄。（一五二）</p>

<h3 id="c146">關於芝加哥博覽會 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>本定六月一日開幕的支加哥博覧會，結果提前於五月二十七日正式開幕了，開　以後，因爲這次的搏覽會，規模的宏大，造成了空前未有的紀錄，所有的出品，足以代表最近一百年來工商業進展的概况：所以一切的一切，都是値得我們去注意的；這個原因，在這喪來報告些瑣碎的消息：</p>
<p>芝博會的建築，因爲規模是如此的宏大，芝博會的建築，當然是驚人的，所有的陳列室，建築的方法，都以科學爲根據。當着手建築之初，預定的建築費，一共美金一一，○○○，○○○元，然而結果竟超過這個預算，而且除了大會担任建築之外，各國的陳列館有的却自已建築的建築費也至少有二，○○○，○○○元，除了房屋之外，還有公圍，運動塲，聚全世界的建築師於一處，來規劃這個芝博會，建築的雄偉，在築史上，自然可以代表一個時代的產物！</p>
<p>芝博會的警備規模旣如此的宏大，會塲裏的陳列品，價値的鉅大，自必不可計算，但我們從過去的經騐上，已知道在博覽中，扒手小竊，最是繁多，所以歷來陳列品的遺失，也時有所聞。爲了這個原故，這次在芝博會中，關於警備方面，非常注意，事前徵集了好多有經騐，有訓練的警察，便衣偵探，來往梭巡，看守各室。有一部分警探，是去年洛杉磯亞令匹克世界運動會中服務過，自然有出衆的警探學　與經騐。在一幅法國名盡之前，更有特别警探司看守之職，以防失竊。</p>
<p>芝博會的竊賊說起了芝博會的警探，我們便要聯想到芝博會的竊賊，在美國一般的竊賊，事前聽說芝博會開幕了，良機莫失，都紛紛的來到芝加哥，預備要做一筆好生意了。那知一到了芝加哥，走進了芝博會，發現了防守是如此的嚴密，一般警探的尖銳目光，射到了他們的身上，已使他們魂胆俱喪了。不要說陳列的物口：没有機會去偷竊，就是在成羣結隊的參觀者之中，他們也不敢扒竊挖袋，怕是要被捕呢！</p>
<p>芝博會的交通芝加哥，本來是美國工商業的中心地點，所以鐵路好像蜘蛛網，重要的鐵路，都以芝加哥爲中心車站，論理交通也非常便利，在芝博會開幕時期，所有的賓客，前往參觀的，儘可來往直達，無所窒礙。然而大會的主事人員，爲力求參觀者行旅的便利起見，又預備了好多公共汽車，直駛各處，這樣一來，美國的人，不拘住在鄉村之間，或都市之中，更見非常的便利了。</p>
<p>芝博會的出品在芝博會中，這次各國都出其最優美的出品，運往陳列，以作工商業的競爭。其中美國的出品，以汽車和飛機最多，各廠的新車，和新式飛機，都陳列在一處，很得來賓的讚美。至於中國最可憐了吧？政府因爲在中日糾紛中，本預備不參加，由民衆自動運往陳列，出品中，工業品很少，而美國人所讚美的僅是中國的絲織和剌繡。據說一幅湘繡，繡的是美總統羅斯福的肖像，將來大會閉幕時，將贈與美總統羅斯福。說來眞可憐，其餘的出品，都不能和各國　美了！</p>

<p>中大敎授張其昀講子陶記　　眞正的國防非死的國防、乃活的國防、不是敎人死、乃是敎人生、就是要達到最少限度的危險與最大限度的安慰、没有全國人民做後盾、没有率全國民力以從事戰爭的卓見、只管敎兵士們到前線去衡鋒拚命、使暴骨於黃沙、作無謂之犧牲、這是天下最殘忍不道的事國防並不含有什麽神秘的意味只要全國國民各盡其力、向建國的宗旨共同努力、能夠做到政治清明、百廢俱舉、使外國人無形之中存了敬畏之心、常常使敵人全然不敢稍起一問鼎中原的念頭、這就是國防的上策、若必待敝人來攻、始起而抵抗之、那又是防不勝防的、假使在戰塲陣地或邊疆前線都建築軍事要塞、以資防守、尚不失爲國防的中策試看號稱天下第一關的天然險要、竟未曾設立砲囊、没有深溝固壘的軍事工程、這豈不是最大的笑話嗎、</p>
<p>孫子云、「守者不足、攻者有餘」國防二字切不</p>
<p>可以辭害意、我所最厭聞的就是新近流行的名詞、呌做守勢的國防、天下豈有不能攻而能守之理、一地失守之後、難道就不想反攻了嗎、守勢的國防所以爲劣者、凡事皆被動而非主動、凡百皆伺敵之行動以爲轉移、好像影之隨形、陰紋之隨陽紋、眞有疲於奔命之苦、取法乎中、僅得乎下、這是必然之勢、國防國防、並非終於防禦、其防禦不過爲反對之準備、其反對實具有最强之勢力、其勢力實足以打倒帝國主義者的軍隊故日國防最終之目的在乎戰勝、消極的戰略、與不抵抗主義、相去幾何、</p>
<p>國防有無形和有形兩方面、前者是精神、後者是物質、但物質是跟精神來的、不是精神跟物質來</p>
<p>的、前年杜錫珪氏赴日本考察海軍、嘗謁日本東鄉元帥於私邸、其人厚重寡言、語杜氏日、一君來敝邦考察海軍、宜注意海軍精神一點他非要事也」此外所語皆酬酢事、惟對於吾國海軍前輩蕯上將、詢其安否而言、杜氏日、余雖屢屢談及海軍、主人似不欲言者、余亦不便再凟矣、夫以東鄉地望之崇隆、顧其居處與常人無殊、器物亦極簡樸、洵足爲吾輩矜式、其於海軍不欲多言、不知是何用意、然卽其寥寥數語而論、已覺少許勝人多許矣、</p>
<p>以上所說四點我認爲目前提倡國防敎育的同志所應首先注意而時常體察的、</p>
<h3 id="c148">第二講從敎育觀點談國防敎育 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>諸君都是實際敎育家、關於敎育上普通原理、用不着鄙人來班門弄斧、茲爲集中注意起見、仍不能不提出幾點以供討論、並請諸君賜敎、</p>
<h3 id="c149">㈠敎育上的國計論 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>我們的知識理論、皆爲應付環境解除困難的工具、所謂困難、莫大於國家的困難、卽所謂國難、中國的敎育、旣爲改造中國環境與解救中國大難的工具則敎育方針應注視整個的國防計晝、爲對症發藥之計、一切敎材敎法、其正確可靠與否、亦視</p>
<p>其能否有此功用而决定之、能之、則爲眞不能、則爲僞、所以提倡國防敎育、處處應以功用二字爲前提、例如潛水艇的功用、視本國海軍力量的大小、而各執一說、英國屢次主張廢去潛艇、法國則激烈反對、在華盛頓會議席上、法國全權代表白里安氏所發表之言論、甚有興味、卽當英美日三國、因主力艦之比率而起七成六成爭執之際、白里安氏說道「法國現在對於主力艦、無論如何、均所不論、而所要者、爲潛水艇及巡洋艦而已」又當英國攻擊法國之際、對新聞記者說道「英國以日本爲同盟國、又與美國親善、然其主力艦要有五十萬噸之大海軍、謂其完全對付法國、固所不敢、或將用之於大規模之遠洋漁業乎、因此法國提議建造非常多的潛水艇、亦將從事於海底植物之研究也、」這是何等痛快滑稽的言論、當杜錫珪氏考察列强海軍的途中、德國力勸中國建造潛水艇、日本力辯其無價値、此所謂司馬昭之心、路人皆知、近來航空救國的呼聲、高唱入雲、獨潛水艇的重要、猶未引起注意記得杭州市小學生曾有爲海軍造艦集資捐欵的事、而敎育當局則謂不如移作飛機捐欵、這是頗煞風景的、濳水艇的功用、可使海軍實力過弱之國不致完全處於被動與防禦地位、而亦可以從事於攻擊之舉潛艇不但可用之於領海之内、而亦可用之於領海之外、歐戰時、德國潛艇曾濳行至美國海岸、往返途中、無須補元燃料、在海戰中、濳艇本身雖無决定勝負之威力、但亦可牽制敵方一部分之兵力、使敵人精神上無時不感受被攻擊之危險、且濳艇之建造費比較輕微、造一隻戰艦之費、至少可造中等濳艇二三十隻是以大多數弱小國家、莫不努力於濳艇之設備、以吾國目前國計按之、與其期望主力艦而不可急得何不先事完成濳艇的製造、藉應國防上的急需呢、昔黃黎洲先生有言「學問之道以自已用得着者爲眞敎育上之新學說、亦主張「敎育之道、以本國用得着者爲眞」中國敎育的前途、一方須在國防上求適應、是實際的、不是空汎的、一方須在國難中求進步、是活動的、不是靜止的、我們試稱之爲國計論、</p>
<p>㈡敎育上的民生論敎育卽生活學校本身卽爲一種生活組織、學校中之學業、須與校外生活速爲一氣、要使學生個個成爲能生產的國民、這呌做敎育上民生論、我們並非主張職業主義、我們認爲完備的普通敎育、其價値遠在　狹的專科訓練之上、學所以學爲人、所爲職業敎育者、不外是普通訓練所發展的知識與能力、使之活動於特種地位而已、然工作以外、職業以外、尚有他學、尤其重要的是純潔無上的愛國心、今日各國對於　邦的實力、非僅以海陸軍爲憑、並須視其國内之民氣、卽所謂獨立不撓之精神、我們也並不偏重人文主義、從前二无式的思想、如「勞心」與「勞力」、「治人」與「被治等遺說、我們以爲都應打破、現代的敎育是平民的敎育、旣重好學深思又尊行動勞力、採且學且作主義、使生聚與敎訓都有高速度的這步、以上說是抽象的理論、我們可舉實際成績以</p>
<p>實印證、當日俄交戰時、日本農業之情勢、大表演其彈力、戰爭對於農業要素、其影響固甚多、如壯丁數十萬擲鋤頭而執槍桿、耕馬數萬匹辭田圑而服軍役、耕牛亦有被屠殺而供民食者、農業勞力因戰役而减少旣如此、而其時租稅之增徵戰債之召募、使農家負擔加重者亦甚多、因而使農業資本大爲减少、然而日本農民在這個非常時期、顯出他們愛國的至誠、節衣縮食、以補農業資本的缺乏老、幼男女皆同心恊力、以補農業勞力的缺乏、國家雖有大事、庶民沈重之態、自外觀之、宛如不知其有大戰者、如農務改良諸端、其平日雖勸獎至切、尚不易行者、皆於戰時而廣行之、其成績亦極顯著、於是日本農產遂呈未曾有的豐收、如米之收穫比平年多至五分之一有奇、麥及蠶絲亦各優於平年之生產、日本農民有彈力、能奮勵、戰局延及二年、以勇敢的兵士、精良的軍馬、豐富的糧食、貢獻於國家而尚綽綽有餘、無疑的這是日本明治維新以後二十幾年來敎育的功效、</p>
<p>㈢敎育上之年序論</p>
<p>敎育須適合學生程度與心理狀態英人華拉司君（GrahamWallas)於政治心理甚有研究、嘗謂「最易動兒童情緒者、非言辭也、乃景色(Sght)與聲響(Sonud)也、倘令兒童之愛其國者、則須引之覽當其國内之風光或取而供諸眼前、如偉大之建築、如嚴重之禮饑、皆能使兒童深入人心、而莫能忘懐」小學學生知識初萌首當鼓舞其興趣小學的國防敎材、宜注重富於趣味的故事及富於色彩的模型其敎材組織但須成竹在胸、不必鄭重宣布、蓋條理井井、系統秩然、非兒童之所喜、初中學生、秩序觀念已漸確立、中外大勢已漸明瞭、國防敎材可由簡而繁由近而遠、然高深之理論、尚非其時、高中學生可因性質之不同實行分組辦法假定分爲三組日數理組日文藝組｀日時務組、則國防敎材須分别精選、折衷至當、大學則分科更細因材施敎之原則更爲顯著國防敎育與各系各門均有直接間接之關係、學生可就其性之所近、力所能勉者、爲高深之研究、大抵中學時代敎多於學、大學時代、敎學並重、至研究院則無所謂敎、僅爲專心研究、現代戰爭、不僅爲兵士的戰爭、而爲科學的戰爭、或是由科學而生的技術的比武戰爭的利器不在砲艦飛機的本身、而在創造砲艦飛機的工業、抑不在一國的工業、而在創造工業的科學研究、嚴幾道先生有言「國民果有程度、則死灰之燃、當尚有日、無識之民、發揚蹈厲轉害事也、</p>
<p>㈣敎育上的環境論</p>
<p>敎育膛但要因時施敎因材施敎、又要因地施敎、現代學校的經營、依各地的情狀、表現其特殊的色彩、卽所謂本地風光、例如上海的敎育應多多注意於海上發展、養成學生的海國思想與海國精神、若不能使學生有遠大眼光、這是不合時地的敎育、歐洲有一名詞爲我中國歷史上所未及見者卽海上權力是也、亦簡稱日海權、日本明治之世各業莫不有長足之進步、其最顯著者、則推海運業與造船業、造船業爲一種綜合的工業日本各種機械工業、與船舶無關係者、幾乎無有、造船廠的機械工業不但對於海軍有貢獻、對空軍陸軍亦有貢獻、造船業發達、航運業當然發達、而海運又爲海軍之基礎、海運的盛衰隆替、卽國家的盛衰隆替、日本當國家有事之秋、幾萬海員、應急需而立辦、可知日本海軍的成功、不是偶然的事、二十世紀是太平洋時代、這句話是前美國大總統羅斯福說的、羅斯福爲確立美國海軍政策之人、生平提倡海軍不遺餘力、一九二二年政府明定其誕辰（十月二十七日）爲海軍節、近因遠東風雲險惡、美人益重視此節、中國雖没有海軍節、我希望上海教育界特别重視海權、爲沿海各省倡、例如上海市敎育局可設法聯絡航業界僱用幾隻訓練航業的船隻、專爲學生有志於海上事業者學習航海之用、凡海運應知之事無不應有盡有、因勢而利導之、提倡海國利益、養成航海思想以爲中國振興海軍的先聲、蓋天下事觀察必先於事實、未有絕無觀念而能有事實發生者、這也是總理所謂知難行易的意思</p>

<h3 id="c177">豪語的折扣 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 葦索</p>
<p>豪語的折扣其實也就是文學上的折扣，凡作者的自述，往往須打一個扣頭，連自白其可憐和無用也還是並非「不二價」的，更何况乎豪語。</p>
<p>仙才李太白的善作豪語，可不必說了；連留長了指申，骨瘦舅柴的鬼才李長吉，也說『見買若耶溪水劍，明朝歸去事猿公』起來，簡直是毫不自量，想學剌客了。這應該折成零，證據是他到底並没有去。南宋時候，國步艱難，陸放翁自然也是慷慨黨中的一個，他有一回說：『老子猶堪絕大漠，諸君何至泣新亭。』他其實是去不得的，也應該折成零。丨丨但我手頭無書，引詩或有錯誤，也先打一個折扣在這里。</p>
<p>其實，這故作豪語的脾氣，正不獨文人爲然，常人或市儈，也非常發達。市上甲乙打架，輸的一面大抵說：『我認得你的！』這是說，他將如伍子胥一般，誓必復　的意思。不過總是不來的居多，倘是智識分子呢，也許另用一些陰謀，但在粗人，往往這就是鬥爭的結局，說的是有口無心，聽的也不以爲意，久成爲打架收塲的一種儀式了。</p>
<p>舊小說家也早看穿了這局面，他寫暗娼和人相爭，照例攻擊過别人的偷漢之後，就自序道：『老娘是指頭上站上站得人，臂膊上跑得馬·····』底下怎樣呢？他任别人去打折扣去。他知道别人是决不那麽胡塗，會十足相信的，但仍得這麽說，恰賣假藥的，包紙上一定印着『存心欺世，雷殛火焚』一樣，成爲一種儀式了。</p>
<p>但因時勢的不同，也有立刻自打折扣的。例如在廣告上，我們有時會看見自說『我是坐不改名，行不改姓的人』，眞要驀地發生一種好像見了『七俠五義』中人物一般的敬意，但接着就是『縱令有時用其他筆名，但所發表文章，均自』</p>
<p>負責，』却身子一扭，土行孫似的不見了。予豈好『用其他筆名』哉？予不得已也。上海原是中國的一部分，當然受着孔子的敎化的。便是商家，櫃内的『不二價』的金字招牌也時時和屋外『大廉價』的大旗互相輝映，不過他總有一個綠故：不是提倡國貨，就是紀念開張。</p>
<p>所以，自打折扣，也還是没有打足的凡『老上海』，必須再打一下。</p>
<h3 id="c178">揣 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>現在的學生，大抵未投考先想到出路，常常對着一大張滿載招生廣告的報紙而忐忑：文科是萬萬不行的了，敎育部不是已在限制招收文科學生了麽？中國的實業倘能發達起來，那麽最好是進工科，可是那「發達」還不可必。入法科而爲法官或律師乎？入商科而爲銀行員乎？學無線電或航空是最合時宜的，或者就進外國語專修學校罷，將來可以到外國人手下吃飯，否則也可以做翻譯家，要快，則學日本文····</p>
<p>對於女學生，先前是蠶桑，幼稚師範，產科，而現在都有些靠不住了。最近有幾省，要辦女子警察了，於是『考警官』又在她們心目中成了一條新而穩的路。</p>
<p>這種心思，漢朝的王充名之日「揣」，和現在所說的「投機」差不多。不過比商業上的投機，更少把握。</p>
<p>王充的「論衡」上，就記着一個「揣」的失敗者，「泣涕於塗，自傷年老失時」。人家問他爲什麽不能得意，他說：</p>
<p>「吾年少之時，學爲文：文德成就，始欲仕宦，人君好用老。用老主亡，後主又用武。吾更爲武；武節始就，武主又亡。少主始立，好用少年，吾年又老，是以未嘗一遇也」！</p>
<p>世事太複雜，變動又太快，揣得着的把握，眞成「幾希」了。於是結果只能亂「碰」，猶如以十瑰錢碰頭獎五十萬。</p>
<p>然而，我「揣」了條路，是百無一失的，現在情願貢獻給彷徨中的青年。這路是：學打仗。</p>
<p>中國的内戰，大槪還有許多年的生命，需兵。對外的戰爭呢，將來總要有的罷，需民族英雄。倘若革命一來，就需要戰士。萬一山窮水盡，要「上梁山」時，也必須是好漢。····會打仗的人，出路是正多着。</p>
<p>鄉下的廟宇裏，一年到頭挿着招兵的白旗。陸軍大學，中央軍事政治學校等，每年也在招生丨進路又是多的。</p>
<h3 id="c179">談「昭君變」 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>嘗讀唐王建觀蠻妓一詩云：「欲說昭君斂翠娥，清聲委曲怨於歌。誰家年少春風裏，抛與金錢唱好多。」此一蠻妓以說唱昭君故事爲生，其所說所唱，未知取何形式，如蘇灘乎？如大鼓彈詞乎？抑如花鼓小調乎？又全唐詩載一世次爵里皆無可考之詩人吉師老，有看蜀女轉昭君變一詩云：「妖姫未著石榴裙，自道家連錦水濆。檀口解知千載事，清詞堪歎九秋文，翠眉顰處楚邉月，畫卷開時塞外雲。說盡綺羅當日恨，昭君傳意向文君。」此一蜀女說唱昭君故事，且張昭君出塞畫卷矣。詩題所謂轉，當然即六朝以來，和尚吟誦佛經，稱爲轉讀之略詞也。其所謂變，當爲變文之意。三十年前，甘肅敦煌石室，發見李唐五代人寫本，其中有大目犍連冥問救母變文，舜子至孝變文，降魔變文，佛本生經變文等，三四十種。此種文體，散文韻文夾雜，有說有唱，似以唱爲中心。近見劉復敦煌掇瑣，内有擬題爲昭君出塞之一種，原題不知云何，其文頗多殘缺訛誤。今引其描寫昭君之死一節於此，以見一斑。</p>
<p>從昨夜以來，明妃漸困。應爲異物，多不成人。單于重祭山川，再求日月。百計求方，千般求術。······恰至三更，大命方盡。單于脫却天子之服，還著庶人之裳。披髪臨喪，魁渠並至。驍夜不離喪側，部落豈敢東西。日夜哀吟，無由蹔掇，慟悲切調。乃明妃哭處，若爲陳說丨</p>
<p>昭軍昨夜子時亡，突厥今朝發使忙。三邊走馬傳胡命，萬里非書奏漢王。單于是日親臨哭，莫捨須臾守看喪。解劍脫隊天子　·披頭還著庶人裳。·················寒風入帳聲猶苦，曉日臨行哭未殃。昔日同眠夜即短，如今獨寢覺天長。何期遠遠離京兆，不憶冥冥臥朔方。早知死若埋沙裏，悔不敎君還帝鄉。此種文體，恰似變文，意者此即蠻妓蜀女說唱之昭君變歟？羅振玉稱爲明妃傳固不是，胡適之稱爲明妃曲亦非，劉復擬題爲昭君出塞猶未見妥，四年前予作昭君變考，載於南國周刋，始定名爲昭君變，發表以後，注意者稀。頃見鄭振鐸挿圖本中國文學史，則稱此文爲明</p>
<p>妃變文，未知其先見予文否？硜硜之意，仍以正名昭君變，較爲有據，質諸有考據癖歷史癖之胡聖人（適之），想當以予說爲然也。</p>
<h3 id="c180">爪哇之夏 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 黃仁傑</p>
<p>一到夏天，熱得走頭無路時，我便常常憶起離開多年的，我的第二故鄉爪哇。</p>
<p>爪哇是無所謂夏的，那邊的氣候，一年到頭全差不多。没有到過南洋的人，總以爲靠熱帶的地方，氣候一定非常難受，其實並不。譬如爪哇罷，每天最熱的時候不過二三小時，其餘的時候也很凉快的，晚上有時還得蓋氈毯呢</p>
<p>在上海，除掉極少數的大富翁能夠往廬山莫干山等遠處避暑外，其餘中產階級或靠俸給爲活的人，想在上海附近找個清凉的地方逃避幾小時的炎威都不可能。上海的郊野是不能領敎的，到處是糞穢，棺材，墳堆，没有一座小山，没有一個樹林。</p>
<p>而在南洋的都會便不然，那邊的豪商大買固然有他們銷金的勝地，而中產階級及靠俸給生活的人們也自有他們避暑的地方。</p>
<p>說來眞又不能不感謝動輒以開化異族自命的西洋人了。現在爪哇的大都會如巴達維亞，建築之整齊，街道之清潔，與歐洲任何都市比較毫無愧色，固不論已；而都市以外的郊野也都給他們整得異常清潔，美麗。</p>
<p>我住在巴達維亞的時候，常在下午太陽偏西的時候，邀兩個朋友坐摩托車往郊外納凉。車子在寛廣的，兩旁種着椰子樹的柏油路上飛馳，清風拂面，溽暑全消。再看路旁時而是碧油油的稻田，時而是陰森森的菓園，時而是鬰鬰葱葱的橡樹，時而是整整齊齊的蔗林，一片自然與人力合成的美景，眞夠你賞心悅目。</p>
<p>隨後揀着一處僻靜地方把車子停下來，或在土人住的茅屋前的空地上，或在四無人聲的田埂上，把我們帶來的凉蓆舖下，把留聲機，汽水，啤酒，點心等一樣樣的從汽車裏面搬出，我們坐下來吃着，玩着，談笑着：吃飽了之後，便躺下來呼吸着原野的新鮮空氣，呼　吸着在都會裏面呼吸不到的草木的幽香，傾聽着在都會裏面聽不到的虫鳥的唱答。大家都覺塵慮盡棄，不知不覺地走入飄飄欲仙的幻想界去了。直到一彎新月高高地掛在天上，這才坐起來收拾東西，在清凉如洗的大道上馳車歸去。</p>
<p>這樣的樂趣，是在東方大都會的上海所能享受到的嗎？往事如烟，回想起來，惟有悠然神往而已。</p>
<h3 id="c181">平凡的事（三四） <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>「這一層，等我呌遂吾去辦罷！事情容易，好辦。」接着雍孫就喊遂吾過來，向他說明來由，要他趕緊去辦；後來又說：「你先去找歐蘭克斯罷，遂吾；商量不好，再去找羅馬内斯和易卡爾索，這三個人之中，」</p>
<p>總有一個有辦法。」</p>
<p>「好的，老伯。遂吾說，」那末從那一天起頭呢」？「就從大年夜罷」。</p>
<p>「我明天就去辦；辦好立刻就有回音」。　　這種辦法，在雍孫固然是數見不鮮，然而在老五却眞感激不盡；至於子春方面，儘管開始在快意之中有些不快意地懷疑，但是後來想到這種無本生利的賣買背着人也不妨做幾回，所以也就處以大度。於是這一男一女，就只眼巴巴地望着遂吾的回音了；裏曉得不到兩三點，閘北的愛國健兒已經動手實行抗敵！</p>
<p>這樣光榮的空前劇變，發生於帝國主義者的肘腋之間，當然我瘊們對於他們的種種紙老虎式的傳統信仰心因而减色不少，並且他們也顯然减少了對於自已的信仰心，所以把他們素來用掩耳盜鈴手段允許秘密公開的「二百八十一號」那樣的地方，暫時一律加以封鎖；同時那些顧客，也因爲自身的物質供給感到不及向來寛舒，所以在開始的那個五六天，誰出没有心思想到那種頑意兒上面，我們用不着說子春和老五也都死了心。可是一週之後，大衆對於打仗所生的恐怖，像是漸慣了，加以剛剛遇到陰歷的新年，誰也感到有些手癢，於是就有些人暗自找幾個同道，喑自用小規模幹起來：像我們這位交游甚雜興致甚豪的雍孫，自然也是這些人中的一個，他幹了兩三天就覺得不快意了，並且大家也覺得不快意了，而他又復想到了老五身上，於是他就計畫如何來實踐從前於老五的那個宿諾。</p>
<p>事實上，他的計畫不到三天就實現了。其中供給房屋做窩家的，就是那些披着老虎皮的甚麽「兌斯」和甚麽「内斯」那類的外國人，供給資本做莊家的，就是雍孫同道中的幾個闊朋友，供給心力做招待而平分抽頭利益的，就是老五一「家」人，另外還有遂吾那樣一干人在外面宣傳打點照料。這些抛開一切自以爲能彀秘密地及時行樂的人，今天頑到東，明天頑到西，眞是十分起勁，然而他們那襄曉得捕房襄面，已經把他們看做一羣肥羊，只待設法制伏了那身披虎皮的牧羊人就來一網打盡！</p>
<p>這一夜的光陰，他當然也是興高采烈地在這個塲所　消遣完的。</p>

<p>丨滬爲平民菜·····川爲席上珍丨海蜇，爲我國特有之海產品。科學上之名稱，卽水母，又名　，屬腔腸動物。形如張織，半滑而軟。色淡藍，其薄皮卽俗稱之「海蜇皮」。下有八腕，延長如柄，色淡紅，卽俗稱之「海蜇頭」是。</p>
<p>海蜇，大宗產於浙江定海之岱山，黃隴，及泗礁等各小島。每年五月霉汎，各近海洋面，卽有是類海蜇出現，浮遊於海面。漁者捕獲，置於大桶。以鹽及礬浸之，約經三四度。其水分漸少，色亦轉微黃。隨卽取出，用　籬疊裝，上復繞以網形篾絲。每件約高二尺半，重約三百餘斤。裝成後。卽運滬投鹹魚行或海味行求售。</p>
<p>凡欲辩别海蜇之優劣者，卽普通所謂「陳海蜇」之「陳」字足以盡之。「凡陳爲貴」。蜇皮須具㈠色光黃亮。㈡片張圓大。㈢體質乾薄。者爲次。蜇頭亦相彷彿。但色光以白嫩爲貴。色紅者係新貨，食時不爽脆。　　海蜇因產於近海，故售價極廉。蜇皮每擔約十一二元，蜇頭則僅六元許。市上小菜塲中，則化一二百文，卽可購得一大張。人旣賞其廉，又因洗滌便利，滋味脆美，莫不喜食之。諺所謂「海蜇蘿葡絲·····」者，蓋以其清凉爽口，别饒風味，深合平民化也。</p>
<p>海蜇除行銷本埠外。外埠當推廣帮銷胃最大，川帮次之。該地人士對海蜇莫不視爲珍品，川中尤甚。距海愈遠，得之愈難，加以沿途輪運頻繁，外費　重，至川非賣五六角一斤不可。川中士紳，每於宴客時用之，平民對之，殊有禁　之感，則又近於貴族化矣。同一物也，易地而貴賤互殊，物稀爲貴，海蜇然，凡事亦然。物之本質，固無所謂貴賤也。</p>

<p>— 潔心</p>
<p>每到溯風凛冽或是暑氣逼人的時候，我便明白一學期又告結束了，這兩天趕著把學生們的試卷交代敎務處去了，於是我便像清了切重負而感覺分外的輕鬆和爽快！同時，這也是說，我的小學敎師的生活也算過去了一學期。但一學期來我得著些甚麽呢？！事實的解答，眞夠人傷心的！　　大概這已成爲普遍性了吧，好些人對小學敎師總是奚落和卑視，他們好像以爲小學敎師都是些不値注意的東西，這原因固然是現有的小學敎師太複雜了：甚麽人都有，差不多没有事幹而會哼幾句的人，都跑上了這個敎台，因此小學敎師的地位就無形低落了。然而整個做小學敎師的光榮便因此而全部破產，這是人們的傲慢呢？還是時代的殘酷呢？·······</p>
<p>這次，我去幹這個玩意兒，本是自願的，是鼓起了勇氣，抖擻精神冒險去幹的，并不曾受任何的壓迫，或是生活的驅使與環境的支配，更没有任何人來慫恿，我是爲了要調劑生活，我需要接近小孩們的天眞，因爲祇有在天眞中才能夠找到眞理。可是在半年的經騐告訴我，却不由得呌我起了無限的傷感！　　在我過去的十幾年中都被羈押在暗無天日的敎會學校裏，雖然以前也曾讀過男女同學的學校，但這還在我很幼小時候的那一年。所以我初來這男女同事男女同學的學校，未免覺得另一種的况味和感覺著不自然，况且又是第一次辦事呢。但我徹底一想，我怪我自已太迂腐太淺薄了！旣然走上了社會的征途，假使我需要男女眞正平等，那我又爲甚麽有這無謂的顧忌呢？我於是竟大著膽子和他們接談了。其實接談也不過這麽一回事啊。但一件事使我怪異的，就是同事間平常都絕對的戴着面異而在互相猜疑著，這大槪就應當是所謂處世藝術嗎？我本來是很孩子氣的，說話老是爽直而隨便，後來漸漸知道自已太憨了，於是便硬裝出老成的樣子來，於是我便隊入了一個極大染缸，漂去了我固有的天眞，染上了處世的藝術，至於面具，當然也無條件的被加上了！然而這種作爲，是何等的違反良心啊！</p>
<p>小學生的年齡太參差了，高班的學生們年齡是大得可以的，有的竟比我還大些，有的身材比我還高些：但當他們每次到辦公室來和我談話的時候，他們先脫帽行禮和流露出天眞的憨態來，這唯有這才足以使我感到一種不可言喻的情緒與况味！丨呵，然而這又打那兒說起呢？因爲他們的作爲都是假的呀！這予我的失望和創痕，是何等的深刻！我是深走入了動物院了，環繞我的都是猙獰，却是恐怖！</p>
<p>雖然如此，我從没有妥恊過，我要忌記過去丨這可咒詛的過去，我也不惮憧憬將來丨這虚渺而無可捉摸的將來，我應當拚着我的力來創造，創造現在丨一個光明的現大！</p>

<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>失蹤了三天的小花貓，吃中飯時候又在我脚邊咪咪地呌着，牠更見憔悴，瘦弱，可憐地望着我，像一個垂死的乞兒；我不由想起小花貓的主人張老太太來。</p>
<p>張老太太是個五十歲光景的慈祥底老婦人，三年前租賃了我家的一間小屋，一個人孤獨地住着，不見有親戚往來，也不見她出門一步；她更不好說話，像旁的上年紀的婦人，喜歡嘮嘮叨叨地西家短，東家長。住了許多時候，還不很和鄰近往來，間或門口遇見的時候，說一句今天天氣啊，飯吃過了，就俯首去撫愛她懷中的小花貓。牠是她唯一的伴侣，唯一的消遣這悠悠的歲月，張老太太一如小孩子一般和牠打混，有時喃喃地和牠說話，似乎告訴小花貓她的可憐的身世，其實小花貓知道什麽呢，僅是咪咪地呌着，但在張老太太聽來，小花貓的呌聲却是同情她的表示。那小花貓確也滿可愛的，小小的身軀，一對碧綠的眼珠閃耀在黑色鼻樑的兩邊，背上兩個黃色的圓形，像羽士蟒袍上兩個八卦圖，全身雪白，如其在青草叢中追撲蝴蝶，活像一頭兎子。</p>
<p>光陰催人衰老，張老太太已在我們的小屋中居住了一年，好依是初來時那般沉默，孤獨，吃喝睡覺之外，玩弄她的花小貓，或者她更增加幾條蕭蕭白髮。</p>
<p>這年的秋天我結婚，親戚鄉鄰都致禮慶賀，見了我母親，一片「恭喜」「福氣「的喊，却引動了張老太太的悲哀，她以爲做喜事多少取吉利的，所以獨自回小屋去放聲大哭，終於被一個鄰居的婦人探出了她的身世。</p>
<p>丨她家也是中人之產，她　丈夫獨資在城中設南貨店，生活當然對付裕如。不過她們結婚後，膝下猶虚，終年求籤問卜，修橋舖路，在她三十多歲纔如願以償，生了個兒子。夫婦倆愛如珍寳，自不必說。後來父親死後，孩子溺愛成性，偷了家中錢，狂嫖濫賭，南貸店舖虧空過鉅，終於倒閉，他就偷了張老太太的衣飾，一去不回。丨</p>
<p>張老太太哭着說，我的兒子在，也有房東少爺這般大了，我見人家兒子娶媳婦，我想起了自已的兒子，不由得哭起來了。</p>
<p>這秘幕揭開之後，鄰近對之張老太太都覺可憐，不因了她寡言默笑都很親近她。</p>
<p>去年也是知了噪着的夏天，我們街上來了四個兵士，說奉了長官乂長之之命，來接張老太太。鄉下人原見不得背槍桿子的，都竊竊地私議起來，以爲張老太太或者是個什麽秘密人物。我問清楚了他們長官的姓氏，却正是張老太太的兒子，張老太太那時的喜歡，祇仰天念佛，收拾了一點細軟，隨着四個兵士去了，她說隔幾天喊兒子來謝謝房東及諸位鄉鄰。現在又是知了噪着的夏天，我們從此不知她的下落，可是遺下的那隻可愛的小花貓，不見了主人，終日不思飲食，咪咪地呌着，在我脚邊打滾，似乎問我牠主人到那裏去了。我望着牠更憔悴，瘦弱的身軀，不由我想起張老太太來。</p>

<p>— 玉章</p>
<p>上海臭虫多，這句話是不虚的，在用的穿的吃的上面，差不多都有牠的踪跡：如睡的床上，坐的凳上，穿的衣上，甚至於吃的飯裏，就是那美麗的油光紙裏着的麺包，都有我親眼發現了臭虫的踪跡！這是我有生以來，最初得的新聞奇事；不過是因我有生以來，初入上海境地，所以只可說，初次發現這個情形，那些老上海們，對於這種情形，是不覺一回什麽事的。</p>
<p>最近的幾天，我因爲要準備投考學校，每日都是很辛苦的看着書，用着思想，一刻的時間，也不敢休息，早上八點鐘到十二點鐘，下午一點鐘到五點鐘，每日差不多連着十個鐘頭，要用腦力的。到了晚上，是疲倦極了，天氣又是如此熱，怕出汗的我，又不能早去睡，所以每日總要挨到九點鐘才能安睡。這個時候，當然是我一天中最快樂最甜蜜的時候了。不必說，一觸枕，馬上就入夢了。那知安夢不到廿分鐘的時間，那可恨的臭蟲也就來侵犯我了，使得我不能安睡，使得我從甜夢中醒來，我將手抓摸着全身的各部，大部份是感覺一點一點的凸起的肉色，這個凸起的地方，看年着是紅腫的感着是痛癢的。最初我仍是朦朦朧朧的，用手去抓幾下，還是入睡了；那知第二次侵犯又吵得我不能睡，只得爬了起來，將電燈開亮，再回到床前去捉牠，差不多床的周圍都找遍了，也看不見一隻臭虫的影子，這時我眞可奇怪了，明知是有臭虫來騷擾我，怎麽又是看不見牠呢？好睡的我，只得又朦朧去了，也懶以去深問牠的究竟。只刹那間，又是同樣被擾不相信，我再TYT，等我開燈後，侵敵又是逃到九宵雲外去了。我恨極了！我驚異極了！如此小小動物，牠能有如此的靈巧知覺，聰穎的本能，難道人不能競勝於他嗎？這個當兒，我實在已倦乏極了，睡神竟綿綿的繞着我，不得已，仍是去睡了；及到第四次的掻擾，我才生了一個計策，將我同房的人喚醒，呌她代我開燈，哈哈！果然是人類聰明，終久被競勝了。這時果然發現許多身小色紅的臭虫，在我周身爬來爬去的，牠似得意的樣子，可是再能逃掉嗎？不到五分鐘，是已被我捉得乾乾凈凈了。這樣以後，才能安睡到第二天。</p>
<p>而第二天呢？這眞呌我不能再繼續想像了！第二天夜裏，牠們還不是仍然在活動嗎？而且人馬更衆，戰鬥力更兇了。我是已經束手無策了。但在這個無策之中，我理解了！「它們完全爲了生活問題」啊！</p>

<p>如何，今天雖被你瞞過了大家，說什麽願作無名英雄的話。只是你現在旣然有名了，便得要乂乂通訊社不斷的爲你造些前方消息來登在報上，要是露出了馬脚，却不是玩的，今晚打一個電報去如何？』</p>
<p>將軍沉吟良久，很有城府地回道·　　「老王，你也枉活動一輩子了，我旣然總有點把握的·乂乂若不肯代造新聞，好在已議决了好幾萬，我們再多送點錢去就是。縱令他眞不肯，我們便不妨運動秦皇島上的日本無線電台，因爲最近日本軍部的策略正需要在中國造東北義軍的僞數目與僞勝利消息，以便在我們的虚張聲勢中，自已從容地準備實力，消滅義軍，而國内則惑于勝利的情形，不作更進一步的準備，所以他們秦皇島的無綫電台，專在捕風捉影，傳播種種義軍新聞，可憐中國的通訊社所收到的新聞，大都是秦皇島所播。照這種情形，乂乂通訊社雖則明白我們内幕而不發，但是他總不能禁止其他的通訊社呀！」</p>

<p>— 孤掌</p>
<p>記得五六年前，電影武俠明星范朋克偕其夫人「世界甜心」曼麗璧克馥雙雙到上海，曾經哄動過一般電影迷。去年范朋克又到上海，却是子然一身，曼麗璧克馥呢倒在好萊塢獨守空房，這件事已經有點奇怪了。最近接得洛山磯電訊纔明白范朋克同璧克馥正在恊議離婚哩！而且皮浮里山上的范朋克房屋也正標價出售。</p>
<p>至於范朋克同璧克馥離婚的線索可以縷述如下。洛山磯電訊載着璧克馥親口所舉的離婚理由是無法同居，此外並無别的原因。此話傳出前幾年中間，范朋友同璧克馥早已仳離了。第一次范朋克到歐洲說是爲業務假期而旅行的。他後來來到東方，没没無聞了好久，却演成了一部打獵影片。他把夫人丢在好萊塢托辭說璧克馥不歡喜旅行。</p>
<p>第二次他同他的兒子小范朋克又到倫敦，其時小范朋克剛同瓊克勞馥離婚。他又說是休假游歷，又說是壁克馥不愛游歷。但是璧克馥確曾到英意兩國遊歷過好幾次呢。范朋友前次在滬時曾說要同璧克馥到上海合拍影戲，那末如其離婚成功，這件事就不免因此成爲泡影了。</p>
<p>范朋克同璧克馥是一九二零年結婚的，其時璧克復青二十六。她同范朋克結婚的時候，剛同歐文馬脫離夫婦關係，她同歐文馬離婚的原因說是他在蜜月第一日便背離了她，一去三日遂歸。璧克馥新近從她母親的遺囑承繼着二十萬鎊遺產。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>（派拉蒙出品）</p>
<p>在這樣的炎炎夏日，走進冷氣宜人的大光明，去看如此細膩甜蜜的影片，我想諸位一定覺得奶滿意的吧；假使我們並不想在這一影片中得着何等新的啓示或敎訓，那末在娛樂的立塲上，這種影片是可以使人感受輕鬆的快感。而且這一見解亦不是完全没有社會根據的，我想能夠優閑自在的走進大光明的人們，原來的目的，也就是爲了盡情的享樂吧。</p>
<p>同時，像這樣影片的攝制，主要的觀衆對象，原是知識較高的LadiosandCentieman，因此，在形式上力求完美，反正這等觀衆决不會像被擯於藝術之宫的圍墻以外的文盲一樣，對於萬花繚亂的歐美影片莫測高深。所以在這一意義之下，『丈夫的秘密』的作者，在演出上盡力的如此誇張，是很可以得着一部份觀衆之讚賞的。</p>
<p>導演的手法活潑而緊凑，這是誰也不能忽視的。例如一羣行騙的賭徒，在取了一筆巨欵之後，而各自帶着高帽坐上汽車，叮事的握手道好，接上便是黑幕的揭穿，其手法之靈巧，在這裹便展開了以後一貫的輕飄情調。再自主人翁畏罪潛行至某小鎭，向一未經世故的女人追求，雖然故事上不免有「巧合」的地方，但這一戀愛把戲的演述，乃是别饒興趣而不泥守舊法的。特别是自以錢卜卦而訂婚，以至婚後的在車上的素描，都是極簡單的塲面，然而這一長長的過程，却是極緊湊而清晰的叙述出來也許這些不是一般人所能理解，可是正是導演的聰明處，與此相同的塲面很多，如妻子交臥房鑰匙給丈夫，如妻子有意使丈夫輸錢等等，尤其是最後丈夫自獄中回家丈夫的撒謊，妻的心照不宣，就此了局，更見輕快，不過據說，以後還有許多，但在影片上却完全省掉。　　除了上述以外，幾個主要演員如克拉克蓋勃爾，和卡羅郎伯等，都是恰到好處。主演「紅情綠意」的桃樂賽麥克爾在這裏祗做一個不重要的配角，但亦不見成功。</p>
<p>再要說到的應當是内容方面了。前面說過，内容十分空虚，只是在形式上很爲賣力。然而我們不能忽略作者是一個很能守法的藝人，所以品行不端的人終於受着妻的感化而天良發現，自動請求刑罰。正因此，這是離開現實十萬八千里的幻想，那末他的說敎的任務也就非常明白的表現出來。</p>
<h3 id="c207">評「紅情綠意」 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>這一影片，又是哥倫比亞的平凡的出品。</p>
<p>姑勿論在這裏出演的如等，誰都没有號召魄力，即就本片的演藝而論，也幾乎全是平凡庸俗。旣不能超羣拔類，亦並非十分沉滯呆板，所謂「中庸之道」，總算是多演了一部影片而已。然而兩個男女生角，到底是在誠懇的演劇，這一點倒是比較可取的吧。</p>
<p>然而整個劇的失敗，决不僅僅是表演的不夠。這劇的本身，就没有什麽存在的價値。固然戀愛把戲已經使人厭倦，何况這戀愛又是平庸的虚構。譬如說作者要寫出有錢人對於女色的貪　，於是只能單調的描寫他在用錢買愛，同時在正面就來一個戀愛至上，所以那個善於交際的富家女便和富人解約而和窮飛行家情奔了。這樣一來，不僅是那一個盡情賭博的富家女的行爲上有着顯著的矛盾，而且這樣着重於戀愛的發展，使那較爲有意義的飛行家苦心從事於科學的鑽研，反而居於次要的地位，甚至於祇是戀愛進展中的配襯而已。至於那飛行家的妹妹的被淫，更是不重要的穿挿。雖然這反而是較爲眞實的生活。</p>
<p>旣然是平淡而空虚的内容，自然在形式上亦不會有驚人的成績。雖然導演在小的地方仍有成功，如寫那一對情人的一夜纏綿，祇在帽子和斯的克上着手，以及飛行上和汽車上的）OK（都見聰明。全部的演出，固然有着相當清楚的演述，然而這也僅是如小學生作文似的清順而已，至於文章上的起承轉合，在這裏是很少運用。所以庸俗的故事由於庸俗的演出終於祗能給人庸俗的印象。　　看了這一影片之後，我祗能寫出這麽一點意見。這樣，出許是不夠充分，然而如此的電影，也祗能敎人寫出這樣淺薄的文章了。</p>
<h3 id="c208">「新羅賓漢」之我見 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 迷糊</p>
<p>「新羅賓漢」完全是外國的七劍十三俠的故事。西班牙大公爵之子，詹崑墨萊泰用其非常飄忽的行動。非常神妙的化裝，和三個毀了他家庭的暴徒鬭爭。終於使暴徒自相誤殺而死。這張影片的意識是，用不到批評的，它是小市民的幻想而已。</p>
<p>至於技術方面，導演者似乎想把故事的開展，儘量的使地飄忽，這一點是相當的做到。</p>
<p>演員方面，男主角的表現，也非常的飄忽。這是演員和劇中人的同化，這種地方即使有好的導演，還不能使一個普通的演員做到，特别是體格的雄偉，姿勢的英爽，非常適合於壯士的條件。　　但是「新羅賓漢」最成功的是在「化裝」。詹崑墨萊泰在戲中出現了好幾次，而出現的姿勢和面貌，没有一次相同。特别使人興奮，就是「黑影」的恍動。因爲這裏有草蛇灰線之妙。觀衆一看到黑影就知道詹崑墨萊泰來了。於是緊張的待着。記得人猿泰山有泰山的長嘯做線索，而「新羅賓漢」以黑影做線索，是極成功的。</p>
<p>自然「新羅賓漢」也有不通的地方，就是萊克大佐不追究詹崑的行爲！許詹崑和他的愛女結婚是一點理由也没有，因爲萊克曾經懸賞捕拿過詹崑的啊！</p>

<p>(Beiping News Agency) Feng Zhi'an's division, along with Liu and Dai's two regiments, arrived in Zhangjiakou by train on the evening of the 7th. Feng Yuxiang has already left Zhangjiakou. The Central Army on the Ping-Sui Railway has not yet received demobilization orders and will temporarily remain stationed in their current locations. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Song Zheyuan arrived in Shacheng, he telegraphed Shi Jingting, inviting him to jointly reorganize the miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province. Shi left for Xuanhua this afternoon to discuss matters with Song. Sun Liangcheng's troops in Xinzhuangzi, Xuanhua, began their withdrawal today and are concentrating in Zhangjiakou. Song's division under Feng Zhi'an arrived in Xuanhua today, preparing to take over the defense of Zhangjiakou. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 219th Regiment of Song's division under Feng Zhi'an, commanded by Liu Jingshan, has deployed its entire regiment to Huayuan on the Ping-Sui Railway. They arrived around 1:00 AM this morning. Song is scheduled to enter Xuanhua with the unit at 5:00 AM. There are still three trains of soldiers at Shuangqiao, which are expected to be fully loaded and depart this afternoon. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chairman of Chahar Province, Song Zheyuan, departed from Beiping for Shacheng on the 5th of this month. Before leaving, he issued a circular telegram stating, humbly: "I, Zheyuan, previously received instructions from the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Reorganization Committee on the 18th, stating: 'The Chairman previously directed military affairs, and Xu Yong, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, acted as his deputy. Now that provincial affairs are important, the Chairman should return to his post to fulfill his duties, and Wu Yong should no longer act as Chairman.' On the same day, I received instructions from the Military Affairs Commission's Beiping Branch, ordering the 29th Army to relocate to various parts of Chahar Province, etc. Zheyuan happened to be suffering from a severe back ailment and requested leave for medical treatment, but repeated urgings prevented compliance. Recently, I received another instruction from the Military Affairs Commission (dated the 4th) stating: 'Commander Song should immediately depart for Shacheng to take over the political power of Chahar Province and handle all military affairs, etc.' Upon receiving this, I, mindful of the deepening national crisis and the need for Chahar's administration to be managed, felt both the long absence from my duties and the urging of the officials. I will comply with the order and return to Chahar immediately to handle all affairs. I humbly request that you not forget me in the distance and issue instructions from afar. I respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration. Song Zheyuan kowtows, tiny (seal of the 5th). (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chahar situation has reached a preliminary resolution since Feng Yuxiang issued a telegram (on the 6th) reporting the handover of political power. After Song Zheyuan arrived in Zhangjiakou, he began reorganizing the various miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province, which will be re-evaluated and reorganized. Feng's future residence has not yet been determined and will be finalized when Song and Feng meet. Song's division under Feng Zhi'an loaded onto three trains and departed from Shuangyushu on the 6th, heading to Huayuan on the Ping-Sui Railway. The vanguard troops arrived at 1:00 AM on the 7th. Song is scheduled to enter Xuanhua on the 7th. The Ping-Sui Railway is expected to extend to Xuanhua within the next few days. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources from Zhangjiakou, there is widespread panic among the people of Zhangjiakou recently. Coal, grain, and salt are all in short supply. The Ping-Sui Railway Bureau's locomotives have only enough coal to last for two days, making transportation difficult. Feng has no solution to this problem. The Communist Party is very active in the area. Feng is still stationed near the New Village headquarters with heavy security. Fang Zhenwu is still stationed in Zhangjiakou. Those traveling from Zhangjiakou to Beiping disembark at Huayuan and walk to Shacheng before taking a train to Beiping. Sun's troops are still stationed in Xuanhua, and it is reported that Song's troops will arrive in Xuanhua today to take over the defense. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan dispatched a special service battalion of 200 soldiers from Shacheng to Xuanhua last night. This morning, the Allied Army in Xuanhua retreated north along the railway line, and Song's special service battalion took over the defense. Song, along with Jiang Bocheng, Qin Dechun, Guo Zhihan, Chen Xiwen, and others, left Shacheng at 10:00 AM this morning, arriving in Xuanhua at noon. He immediately gathered the troops for a speech and ordered the first train of Feng Zhi'an's division to concentrate in Xuanhua, awaiting orders to proceed to Zhangjiakou. Song plans to meet with Feng Yuxiang in Zhangjiakou, after which Feng will leave Zhangjiakou. Feng Zhi'an's division is successively departing from northern Beiping. Feng personally summoned and addressed lower-level officers at the station. After Feng's division departed, the defense area around Shuangqiao was filled by Wu Zhensheng's regiment, which was transferred from Yangquan. Wu's troops arrived in Shizhuang this morning, awaiting a train to the north. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhi'an said, "My division has been ordered to move defenses and is scheduled to complete the departure on the 7th. I will go to Chahar tonight to visit Song in Xuanhua and then determine the date for taking over the defense of Zhangjiakou." (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Song takes over the defense of Chahar Province, the provincial government will be reorganized. Qin Dechun will be appointed as the Director of Civil Affairs, Guo Zhihan as the Director of Finance, Zhang Jiyong as the Director of Construction, and Zheng Dayu as the Director of Education. A clear order is expected to be issued within a few days. All guest troops stationed in Chahar Province will be demobilized. The 40th Army, because Pang Jianren is concurrently serving as the Commander of Bandit Suppression in Chahar Province, will be relocated to Zhangjiakou and will not be transferred elsewhere for the time being. The first step in restoring Ping-Sui transportation is to extend it to Xuanhua. Once Song takes over the defense of Zhangjiakou, full line traffic can be restored. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiong Bin, who previously accompanied Song to Chahar, arrived in Beiping last night and immediately reported to He Yingqin about the Shacheng meeting. According to him, Feng has accepted the results of the Shacheng meeting and issued a circular telegram handing over the military and political power of Chahar Province. Song telegraphed Tong Lin'ge last night, ordering all Allied troops stationed in Zhangjiakou to completely withdraw to Zhangbei by the 7th. Song personally led the pistol battalion to relocate to Xuanhua and is scheduled to take over the defense of Zhangjiakou early on the 8th. Troops will enter the area, and Feng may leave Zhangjiakou within two to three days, planning to go to Zhangbei or Wanquan. Song advised Feng to reside in Tiantai Mountain in western Beiping, and Song sent guards to protect him, but Feng did not agree. Song sent someone to Zhangjiakou again today to persuade Feng, still suggesting that it would be better to relocate south of Zhangjiakou, fearing that going to Zhangbei would result in being surrounded and coerced into issuing arbitrary circular telegrams. Feng showed activity in response to Song's suggestion. Reorganizing the miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province is relatively easy. Sun Liangcheng will return to Tianjin as soon as the Chahar situation is resolved and does not want to stay in Chahar. Fang Zhenwu's strength consists of Zhang Renjie and Bao Gang's two brigades, which have been reorganized by the Military Affairs Commission. Zhang's brigade has also separated from Fang, and only his newly formed guard division of about 1,000 remains with him. Most of the firearms were seized from He Sui's troops. Fang recently sent representatives to Beiping, requesting the reorganization of three divisions and the appointment of Fang as the Border Defense Commissioner of Mongolia and Chahar, concurrently serving as the division commander. No response has been given here. Song plans to ask Shi Jingting to go and begin reorganizing the troops of Ji Hongchang, Zhang Lisheng, and others. Jiang Bocheng will return to Beiping after the Chahar situation is resolved. Jiang has been reporting to Beiping for several days, stating that the Chahar situation is expected to be completely resolved within about a week. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At the Shacheng Pang Headquarters meeting, Jiang Bocheng first reported that the authorities deeply cherish peace and the central government's intentions, saying that the fact that everyone came to meet and speak frankly is a blessing for the future of the country. Then, Song reported the authorities' views on resolving the Chahar issue. The decided methods and Feng's draft telegram were only completed and dispersed at 3:30 AM. At 7:00 AM, Feng convened a meeting with Sun, Tong Lin'ge, Deng Zhexi, Zhang Jiyong, and others in the New Village. After reviewing the methods and telegram text, all expressed acceptance. Tong Lin'ge notified Song Zheyuan by telephone, and Song sent Xiong back to Beiping to report, while Jiang Bocheng stayed in Shacheng to be responsible for directing everything. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Ruming's division is in the defense area east of Beiping, awaiting orders to return to Chahar. Zhang Zizhong's division in Yangquan and Zhao Dengyu's division in Shizhuang will remain in their original defense areas for the time being. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Private sources received a telegram from Yan Xishan on the 7th, expressing support for the peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">He Yingqin on the Chahar Situation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin said that the Chahar situation is only considered a preliminary resolution and still needs to be continuously reorganized. Feng has no real strength. Except for the guards and training corps, all are newly formed bandit troops. The so-called Allied armies have long been at odds with Feng. Representatives from all factions have expressed obedience to the central government. For example, Bao Gang's troops under Fang Zhenwu have been reorganized and are now stationed in Nuanquan Town. Zhang Renjie has been given a title. Fang only has 200-300 rifles from He Sui's troops. Deng Wen and Li Zhongyi's chiefs of staff have been killed for opposing Feng. Deng Wen and Liu Zhendong's militia have surrendered to the central government, so there are no more problems. The military aftermath in Chahar Province is relatively easy. Feng has no authority to issue orders, so there is no need to worry about him in the future. However, the Communist Party is quite active in Chahar, which will become a hidden danger. The central government only recognizes the reorganized troops of Zhang Renjie, Deng Wen, Liu Zhendong, Li Zhongyi, etc., who have been evaluated by the Military Affairs Commission. Japanese troops have indeed mobilized, attempting to attack Dolon. It is not certain whether they will stop advancing because of the resolution of the Chahar situation. If Feng had peacefully resolved the Chahar situation two weeks ago, this matter might not have occurred. The central government strongly hopes that Sun Dianying's troops will depart westward to Qinghai as soon as possible. According to Sun's report, they can depart westward within a month. Since the ceasefire, there are still too many troops in North China. I have always advocated for a streamlined army and deeply hope that everyone will not recruit and expand their armies on their own again. Now that the Chahar situation has been resolved, all departments can slowly plan for reorganization. The restoration of traffic on the Ping-Yu Railway and the handover of Shanhaiguan are quite difficult and are reportedly being negotiated. I have not heard of Zhang Xueliang's return to China, but Zhang is Chinese and naturally cannot live abroad for a long time. It is possible that he will return to China. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Negotiations for Ping-Yu Railway Traffic <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>No Results from Shanhaiguan Conference (Beiping) The matter of restoring traffic on the Ping-Yu Railway was decided during the Dalian Conference. Recently, Yin Tong, Liu Shisun, and others have been meeting with Japanese representatives in Shanhaiguan for several days to discuss the matter. The Japanese representative was Koyama, a senior official of the puppet Fengshan Railway. Our side proposed (1) restoring traffic on the Tang-Yu section and (2) joint transportation methods with the puppet Fengshan Railway. Koyama actually demanded that the Beining Railway trains go directly to Shenyang and the puppet Fengshan Railway trains go directly to Beiping. Our side stated that restoring Ping-Yu traffic is within the scope of the Tanggu Agreement, while the Guandong section is outside the scope, and this negotiation has nothing to do with the puppet state, so it is difficult to agree. Both sides insisted and no results were achieved. Because Koyama's demands went beyond the scope, it is difficult to realize Ping-Yu traffic for the time being. Liu Shisun will come to Beiping in a few days to report on the negotiation situation. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Beining Railway is expected to be completed today, but the restoration of traffic on the railway is still a difficult question. This is because the Japanese side insists that the trains must run to Shenyang. The Chinese side opposes this proposal because if this is the case, the trains of "Manchukuo" can also run to Beiping. Therefore, it is suggested that the trains of both sides each run to Shanhaiguan, and passengers and goods are transferred at the Great Wall Station. This matter is currently being considered by the transportation conference being held in Shanhaiguan. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Central Memorial Week</p>
<h3 id="e5">President Wang Reports on the Lushan Conference Results <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Enriching National Power and People's Strength, and Seeking Cooperation with the World (Nanjing) At 8:00 AM on the 7th, the Central Government held its 90th Memorial Week. Zhang Ji, Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Zeng Zhongming, Chu Minyi, Gu Zhenggang, Gan Naiguang, and other officials, totaling more than 800 people, attended. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting, and Wang Zhaoming delivered the following full report:</p>
<p>Originally, I was ordered to attend the Memorial Week report last Monday, but because I was still on my way back to Nanjing from Xunyang at that time, the Central Committee meeting last Thursday ordered me to attend today to report. What I want to talk about today is the results of the Lushan Conference.</p>
<p>The name of the Lushan Conference came from the fact that Commander-in-Chief Chiang recently summoned the generals of the Jiangxi Communist Suppression Army, divided them into classes, and gave speeches at the foot of Nanshan Mountain in Lushan, providing them with training. People who went to the foot of Nanshan Mountain in Lushan would see many camps, about three or four thousand people, waiting there to listen to speeches and receive training. Everyone shared their experiences to seek military improvements. Therefore, the discussions at this gathering mainly concerned military technology. The Military Affairs Commission has compiled and printed the conference results separately, so there is no need to go into detail here.</p>
<p>As for my trip to Lushan, and the subsequent arrival of Mr. Sun Zhe, it was not to participate in the military conference, but to discuss the current situation. After several days of discussions, a simple telegram was issued. What the simple telegram said was not a new policy or a new direction. The policy and direction were already determined by the Central Committee. The simple telegram only explained the attitude and intentions of dealing with the current situation based on the Central Committee's established policy and direction. It was neither the result of a conference nor a new decision. The original telegram was signed by Commander-in-Chief Chiang and me, which is why. Regarding the simple telegram, what was reported in the newspapers was generally the same, but the original text of the opening sentence was omitted: "Today, the fundamental strategy for saving the country is to enrich national power, and the most urgent task is to eliminate the Communist bandits. If national power is not strong, it is because the people's strength is not sufficient." The newspapers all omitted the sentence about eliminating the Communist bandits. This should be corrected. What is called "national power" and what is called "people's strength"? We can say that "national power" is "people's strength," and "people's strength" is "national power." Although the wording is different, the content is not much different. However, "national power" refers to foreign affairs, the country's external strength, which is the country's ability to survive and stand on its own externally. "People's strength" refers to domestic affairs, the strength of the people. Today, there are two kinds of prejudices among the people in the country. One kind emphasizes national power and ignores people's strength, and the other emphasizes people's strength and ignores national power. Those who emphasize national power and ignore people's strength believe that seeking national survival and independence has no other way except to expand military equipment. They do not know that water has springs, trees have roots, and national power has its source. If the people's strength is not sufficient, national power will not develop. Knowing only to expand military equipment without paying attention to enriching the people's strength will result in not only no development of heavy industry but also the withering of ordinary agriculture, industry, and commerce. All scientific equipment and even ordinary supplies needed must be supplied by foreign countries. When there are seaports, we can still trade with foreign countries, but in case of an emergency, the seaports are blocked, and what must be supplied by foreign countries will be cut off. At that time, what national power can be said? It must be known that the development of national power is the result of the development of science and technology, which is also the result of enriching the people's strength. Seeking not to enrich the people's strength, but only knowing to expand military equipment is futile. On the contrary, emphasizing people's strength and ignoring national power is also a mistake. There are many constructions that China needs to build today. In the midst of hundreds of things waiting to be done, there must be a center as the goal of our efforts. Today, the most important thing is to seek national survival and independence. All efforts must be aimed at this goal. Therefore, the development of people's strength is to enrich national power. If the development of people's strength is only for cultural improvement and material enjoyment, and no attention is paid to the country's ability to survive and stand on its own, then material enjoyment is enough, but the country's survival and independence will not be possible. Such people's strength is not needed in China today. Many countries, in actively enriching people's strength, have everything they should have in terms of beautiful palaces and delicious food, but they pay special attention to developing national power. Therefore, people's strength is enriched, and national power follows. Conversely, if we only seek material enjoyment, emphasize people's strength and ignore national power, we will still fail. The simple telegram said that national power is not strong because the people's strength is not sufficient, and the people's strength is not sufficient because of rural bankruptcy and infantile industry, so commerce is invisibly declining. If we abandon the development of the people's productivity, there is no other way to enrich national power. Today, we must first enrich the people's strength, and at the same time develop national power by enriching the people's strength.</p>
<p>As for the short-term solution, the Communist bandits are rampant, and the problem lies in the heart. Even the work of resisting insults and defending ourselves is restricted and cannot be effectively implemented. Taking only the Central Army as an example, tens of divisions are being restricted, not to mention the others. Since March of this year, the Central Committee transferred a part of the elite troops to the Great Wall to fight, and Nanchang almost fell. Commander-in-Chief Chiang returned to Nanchang to save the situation. After that, He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the western route to suppress bandits, and Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the southern route to suppress bandits, successively took office, and the military situation for suppressing bandits improved. Therefore, the Communist bandits in Jiangxi are a problem in the heart. If the Communist bandits are not eliminated, not only will enriching the people's strength and developing national power be impossible, but even the urgent work of resisting insults and defending ourselves cannot be done. No one would disagree that the most urgent task is to eliminate the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>There are two more paragraphs in the original telegram that need to be supplemented and explained. One is the loan problem, and the other is the Chahar problem. There are currently misunderstandings at home and abroad regarding economic assistance and technical cooperation.</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>The main points are nothing more than the following three:</p>
<p>(1) It is believed that it will damage sovereignty and start the gradual step of joint management. In fact, the light Qing assistance, which has been established, is only the US cotton and wheat loan. Upon reviewing its content, it is not only unrelated to politics, but even in terms of commerce, it is only the nature of goods on credit. How can it damage sovereignty? The outside world speculates that in addition to the cotton and wheat loans, there are other various loans, and even that there is a new banking group being organized. It must be known that the four-nation banking group and the five-nation six-nation banking group were the origin of national subjugation in the Qing Dynasty and the cause of great chaos in the Republic of China. How can they be easily established? According to a telegram from Minister Song, this statement is completely unfounded. As for the League of Nations Technical Cooperation Committee, Minister Song solemnly declared the following two things in a telegram: First, it will absolutely not involve politics. Second, our country will absolutely not take the initiative to propose such matters. In this case, how can it damage sovereignty and have nothing to do with joint management? (2) It is believed that this will promote civil war. Some people in the Southwest are currently holding this view, believing that the Min II loan and the Min VI war loan are repeating themselves. However, we are taking these lessons as a warning. Why would we repeat them ourselves? The resolutions of the Central Political Conference and the Legislative Yuan all stipulate that the use of this loan is limited to agricultural and industrial construction. The Executive Yuan is drafting a plan based on this resolution. The Military Affairs Commission also solemnly declares that it will never use this loan to increase military spending. Not even increasing military spending, how can it be used for civil war? The government has already determined the policy, and there will be more facts to prove it in the future.</p>
<p>(3) It is believed that this loan will have a diplomatic effect, that is, using the power of A to suppress the power of B. Some people in Japan argue that this is still the method of "using barbarians to control barbarians." I am now responsible for declaring that China, feeling the need for construction and the lack of materials, is determined to strengthen economic and technical relations with all countries in the world. This should be the case for China's survival and independence, and it is also not considered a bad policy for the coexistence and co-prosperity of all countries in the world. However, we have self-awareness. Under the current weak situation, all policies of uniting A to control B, whether it is vertical or horizontal alliance, are not enough to disturb others, but are enough to disturb ourselves. We deeply feel that if national power is not strong, we cannot even talk about resistance, nor can we talk about friendship. Moreover, if we had considerable national power, no one would come to unite with us. As for the others, we believe that saving the country today requires having real strength, not holding extravagant hopes or gambling on luck. We currently need real strength to save ourselves, not to harm others. We are so determined when our strength is insufficient. If we are fortunate enough to have sufficient strength one day, this determination will not change.</p>
<p>We have set two plans for family affairs: one is not to use troops, and the other is not to let go.</p>
<p>Avoiding civil war should be the case not only during the national crisis but at any time. If there are other methods to achieve the goal, even if they are more circuitous, more tortuous, and more burdensome, it is still better to avoid civil war. This reason has been explained in the article "Seeking Unification Through Construction." However, because of avoiding civil war, taking a laissez-faire approach to the Chahar situation would be greatly wrong. I am afraid that the result will be even more unbearable than civil war. Why? Because Chahar is a border province, and because Chahar is a province with barren land and poor people. If a border province with barren land and poor people secedes from the Central Government, how can it survive? Wouldn't it become even more unbearable than the Dong San Province (Three Eastern Provinces, aka Manchuria)? That is why I say that the result is more unbearable than civil war. Some people may refute me, saying that Mr. Feng's seizure of Chahar Province once stated that his purpose was to resist Japan and took the recovery of Dolon as proof. As long as the Central Government cancels the North China Ceasefire Agreement and resists Japan together, then Chahar Province will naturally have no risk of seceding from the Central Government. Why doesn't the Central Government do this? I replied that before the ceasefire agreement, the Central Government gathered troops from all over the country and fought with all its strength in the area of the Great Wall. At that time, it deeply knew that the situation was critical and could barely cope. It repeatedly urged the military committee to be in the capital together to jointly decide on major plans. If it was impossible to divide themselves due to their duties, they must send a responsible representative to attend. It can be seen that the authorities did not intend to make decisions alone without consulting the opinions of other responsible persons. By the time the ceasefire agreement was concluded, the authorities were indeed prepared to bear the blame from all sides, but since it had been concluded, it was not something that anyone could easily overturn. We believe that the conclusion of the ceasefire agreement was a very painful thing, but the events of Dong San Province and Rehe did not end with the conclusion of the ceasefire agreement. We still need endless efforts to maintain it afterward. However, efforts must have a complete plan and consistent steps, not something that one person and one corner of the land can do. After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, the Qing court ceded Taiwan. Tang Jingsong, Liu Yongfu, and others refused to recognize it and continued to fight. The person and the event were very sad, but this was because the Qing court had already ceded Taiwan. Now the government has not ceded Dong San Province or Rehe. It is even more out of the question to talk about Chahar Province. Mr. Feng should never regard himself as Tang Jingsong or Liu Yongfu, making Chahar Province a sequel to Taiwan. Mr. Feng is indignant at the conclusion of the ceasefire agreement. I willingly accept Mr. Feng's blame. My only request to Mr. Feng is that in order to save the country, we should have a complete plan and consistent steps. What the content is, it is naturally impossible to announce at this time. However, if Mr. Feng believes that he can recover Dolon, he can recover Dong San Province and Rehe in the same way. Then I should respectfully tell Mr. Feng that the national crisis has reached this point. What is needed is real strength. Big words and grand rhetoric will not only fail to generate strength but will also destroy strength. This should be noted. The above is the real reason why we cannot let go of the Chahar Province incident. The four principles mentioned in the simple telegram are based on this.</p>
<p>If someone asks me, if not using troops means we cannot help but let go, and not letting go means we cannot help but use troops, what should we do? I answer that as long as there are other methods, we will never use troops. The so-called other methods are that the Central Government's people can be sincere with each other, that Mr. Feng can accept all opinions, and that the people of the whole country have a true understanding and correct propositions, generating democratic strength to restrain everything. My attention and hope are especially in the latter.</p>
<p>Now the Chahar affair has not been actually resolved. According to Mr. Feng's world telegram, it seems to have made us despair. However, in the past two or three days, there has been hope for accepting the four principles mentioned in the simple telegram, and at the same time, the news that the puppet army is attacking Dolon has also been the most tense in the past two or three days. It can be seen that things change unpredictably. But no matter what, the fundamental concepts mentioned above will not change due to changes in the situation.</p>
<p>The above are all supplementary explanations of the original meaning of the simple telegram. In short, the way to save the country and survive today is to first enrich national power, and if we want to enrich national power, there is no other way than to develop the people's productivity. I hope that the people of the whole country will concentrate and go towards this goal. The fundamental meaning of the simple telegram is to announce the Central Committee's established policy and direction, as well as its attitude and intention in dealing with the current situation, to the people of the country, not a new decision.

<h3 id="e8">Northwest Border Defense and Development of the Northwest <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Before Huang Musong, the Central Government's Special Envoy, Took Office, Many Chinese People Had New Hopes for the Development of the Northwest. They Believed that Huang's Trip Would Eliminate Local Opinions and Bridge the Years of Division Between the Han and Hui People. Unexpectedly, Reality was the Opposite of Ideal. Huang's Group Stayed in Xinjiang for Less Than a Month. During Their Stay, There Was a Coup in Dihua. According to the General Press, This Coup Was Neither a Serious Escalation of Han-Hui Conflict nor Caused by Any Sudden Problem. It Was Purely Due to Technical Political Relations, Which Led to a Misunderstanding Between the Special Envoy and Local Officials. As a Result, All the Staff of the Special Envoy's Office Left Xinjiang. Special Envoy Huang Also Returned to Beijing Not Long Ago. According to the Central Government's Judgment and General Social Speculation, if the Government Appoints Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai to Lead Xinjiang Province, Then Everything Can Be Settled. At Least, Political Changes Will Not Be Expanded. Given Time, Things Can be Gradually Remedied. This View May Be Believable.</p>
<p>Although the Division Between the Han and Hui People in Xinjiang Province is Said to Be Difficult to Fundamentally Resolve, the Area is Vast, Accounting for Nearly Four-Tenths of the Eighteen Inland Provinces. Traffic is Obstructed. Only the Border Areas Adjacent to Other Countries such as Britain and Russia Have Some Trade. The General Economic Society is Backward, Still in the Transition Period from Pastoral to Rural Economy. Moreover, the Population is Sparse. Although Production is Abundant, the Mentality of Being Content with the Status Quo is Greater Than the Will to Make Progress. Therefore, Local Officials and Leaders of General Society Also Quietly Abide by the Old Habits of Decades Ago. In Politics, They Remotely Support the Central Government, but Locally, They Each Rule Their Own Territory. In Reality, There is No So-Called Active Ambition to Develop Elsewhere. They Only Seek to Maintain Their Current State and Preserve Their Existing Positions. This is Enough to Satisfy Them. This is Why Xinjiang Has Maintained its Original State for the Past Twenty-Two Years. It is Probably Also Due to the Terrain. However, After the European War, the World's Consumer Markets Shrank, and the Sources of Raw Materials Were Limited. Since the Economic Panic of 1929 Began, Capitalist Countries Have Actively Developed Markets. Xinjiang, a Plateau Area with Many Sandy Deserts, is Not Enough to Serve as a Market. However, It is Better Than Nothing. After the Soviet Revolution, It Was Initially Only a Socialist Experiment. In Practice, it Was Not Enough to Threaten Capitalist Countries. Therefore, Xinjiang's Position Several Years Ago Did Not Have as Serious a Political Nature as It Does Now. As for the So-Called Conspiracy to Establish a Hui State and the Plan to Divide Our Northwest, Individual Attempts May Have Existed. However, Public Advocacy Was Never Heard. Recently, the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan Has Been Implemented. The Turkestan-Siberia Railway Has Been Completed. Central Asia is in Its Grasp. The Hui People of Xinjiang Have Naturally Felt Extremely Stimulated. Therefore, Britain, Which Rules India, Has Seized the Opportunity to Enter. First, to Prevent the Expansion of Hui Influence. Second, to Prevent the Extension of Soviet Influence. Third, to Expand the Market to Facilitate the Development of Trade. At the Same Time, After Plundering the Four Northeastern Provinces, Japan is Taking Further Steps to Fully Realize Its So-Called Continental Policy, Intending to Invade Inner Mongolia. Therefore, the Number of Japanese Spies Sneaking Into Xinjiang Recently Has Reached No Less Than Hundreds. The Increasingly Serious Position of Xinjiang is Self-Evident.</p>
<p>Tibet, Which is Closely Adjacent to the Southern Route of Xinjiang Province, Has Long Been Fraught with Danger. Since the Conflict Between the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama Has Been Forced to Leave Tibet. The Dalai Lama Has Then Tried to Implement His Policy of Relying on Britain. On the Surface, Tibet is Still a Territory of the Republic of China, but Actual Governing Power Cannot Reach It. In Addition, the Sichuan Warlords Only Know How to Fight Among Themselves. They Have Abandoned Xikang, Which Has Already Been Designated as a Province. No Wonder the Tibetans Disregard Us.</p>
<p>China is in This Situation. The Development of the Northwest is Truly Imminent. The Development of the Northwest Should Prioritize the Development of the National Economy. However, the Current Northwest Economy is Very Backward. Everything Depends on the Assistance of the Southeast. In Addition, It Has Been Closed for a Long Time. Religious Politics Have Many Contradictions, Causing the Han and Hui People to Be Unable to Cooperate and the Han and Tibetans to Be Intolerant of Each Other. In the Future, If We Want to Develop the Northwest and Actively Improve the Old Economic Structure, We Should Take the Development of Railway Transportation as the Vanguard. Then, the Cultural Movement Can Be Promoted. On the One Hand, We Must Implement Clean Politics and Resolve Religious Differences. General Personnel Issues Can Then Be Advanced Step by Step to Establish Our Country's Century-Long Plan.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Puppet Government's Recently Decided Diplomatic Policy is as Follows: 1. "Policy Towards Japan and China": European and American Countries Organize a Strong Economic Alliance to Protect Their Own Industries. "Manchukuo" Should Form an Eastern Economic Alliance with China and Japan to Counter It. "Manchukuo" Intends to Conclude a Three-Country Customs Alliance. 2. "Policy Towards Russia": The Russia-Puppet Diplomacy is Currently Underway. If the Negotiations on the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway Break Down, Then it Will Establish Sovereignty Over the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Responsibility for the Deterioration of Russia-Puppet Relations Lies with the Russian Side. 3. "Policy Towards Small Countries": Special Envoys from Certain Small Countries are Currently Working Hard in Manchuria to Conduct Friendly Exchanges with the Puppet Government. "Manchukuo" Also Sends Special Envoys to Siam, Afghanistan, India, Vietnam, etc. to Enhance National Relations. 4.

<p>European Tariff Barriers Hinder the Development of American Trade, and the Only Way to Promote New Markets is to Seek Help from South American Countries</p>
<p>Hyde Park: After Returning from the Economic Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Hull Immediately Went Here to Meet with the President. During the First Meeting, Almost Everything Discussed Related to Tariff Issues and the Possibility of Signing Reciprocal Agreements with South America. It is Said that Hull Told the President that European Trade Competition is Fierce, and New Tariff Barriers are Being Implemented for Many American Goods. Therefore, If One Wants to Revive American Foreign Trade, the Current Hope is in South America. According to Reports, Hull Held Many Private Talks with Representatives of South American Countries in London, and It is Said that He Has Already Established the Basis for Concluding New Reciprocal Agreements. Although South American Countries Signed a Reciprocal Agreement with Britain at the Beginning of the Conference, They are Facing the Same Impact of Trade Barriers in Europe as the United States. Therefore, They Also Eagerly Want to Discuss Reciprocal Measures in the Western Hemisphere. It is Said that Hull Reported to the President the New Restrictions on Trade Set Up by Countries Such as France, Poland, and Portugal, Covering Almost 300 Kinds of Goods. As a Result, the European Market for American Products is Declining Day by Day, and It is Necessary to Promote its Market in the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the President Ordered Hull to Immediately Conduct Negotiations with South America to Sign Reciprocal Agreements. Subsequently, a Statement Was Issued from the President's Private Residence, Stating That the President Hopes That a Sincere Achievement Can Be Obtained for Reciprocal Agreements. It is Generally Believed that the Meaning of This Statement Indicates That, as a Result of Private Talks in London, Some of the Agreements Previously Proposed Can Be Signed Immediately.

<p>(Washington) U.S. Attorney General Cummings Has Scheduled the Week Starting This Thursday as the Final Deadline for Civilians to Turn in Hoarded Gold Certificates and Gold Coins. If They Still Fail to Turn Them in by the Deadline, Their Names Will Be Published, and Lawsuits Will Be Planned. According to Cummings, There Are Still Approximately 300 Million Yuan Each of Gold Certificates and Gold Coins Hoarded by Civilians. Several of Them Have Questioned Whether the Law on Turning in Gold is Constitutional and Have Challenged the Government, Waiting Quietly for Lawsuits. Therefore, the Government Will Satisfy Their Curiosity. At the Same Time, According to Leaders of the Gold Mining Industry, the Output of Gold Mines is Decreasing Daily. In March, All Gold Mines Were Intensifying Their Work Due to the Worldwide Lack of Gold Coins. The Gold Sand Produced That Month Was Worth a Total of 5 Million Yuan. Now, Because Pure Gold Must Be Completely Purchased by the Government, the Output Has Sharply Decreased. The Total Output for the Month is Less Than 4 Million Yuan. However, Because Attorney General Cummings Announced That Unrefined Ore Can Be Legally Exported, They are Currently Planning to Centralize Ore Transportation and Export Business, Asking Shipping Companies to Estimate the Ore Transportation Costs in Order to Determine Whether They Can Make a Profit.

<p>(Tokyo) In Order to Prepare for the Opposition of Economic Groups, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry Knows That There is a Need to Change the Traditional Liberalism Policy and Adopt a Resurgent Trade Policy. Therefore, It Urgently Seeks to Expand the Communication Network. Recently, From the Perspective of the World's Realities, Passive Coordinationism Has No Practical Results. Therefore, the Markets That Have Been Obtained in the Past Have Been Lost. The Example of South Africa and Other British Colonies is Very Obvious. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry Will Not Only Support the Market but Also Intends to Further Break Through the Economic Group to Obtain New Markets. It Has Decided to Take Next Year as the First Year to Continuously Strive to Obtain New Markets in a Comprehensive Manner. The Traditional Correspondents Only Report on Market Conditions and Do Not Achieve Practical Results. In the Future, The Correspondents Will Be Abolished in Important Places, and Large-Scale Trade Officials Will Be Established to Collect Information Necessary for Developing Markets and Actively Serve as a Medium for Trade.

In This Confrontational Situation, If We Hastily Transfer Troops to Suppress the Bandits, I am Afraid That the Remnants of the Liu-Deng Dispute Will Reignite. Therefore, Referring to the Intentions of the Generals in the Previous and Subsequent Telegrams, I Propose Three Methods: 1. Zi Gan Leads a Part of the Troops to Specialize in Defending Xikang and Must Move Quickly. 2. The Remaining Troops Should Be Commanded by Xiang to Suppress the Bandits, So That They Can Immediately Express Their Telegrams, or Change Their Flags and Set Off One After Another. 3. In Order to Promote the Foregoing Methods, Our Army Must First Cross the River with a Part of the Troops to Facilitate Supervision and Implement the Above Articles. I Have Telegraphed These to Zi Gan and His Generals. If They Can Be Solved in This Way, They Can Eliminate Internal Strife and Join Forces to Suppress the Red Bandits. Relying on the Central Government's Virtue, They May Be Able to Comply as Scheduled. (Special Dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>Ju Zheng's Report at the National Government Memorial Week (Nanjing) The National Government's Memorial Week was held on the 7th. Chen Shaokuan, et al., attended. Chairman Lin Sen, Ju Zheng gave a report titled "From the Failure of the World Economic Conference to China's Way Out," which stated in brief: There were many reasons for the failure of this World Economic Conference. Due to the conflicting interests and stances of various countries, the Economic Conference ended in a disastrous failure. In the future, the tariff exchange dumping wars of various countries will inevitably be fiercer than before. All countries feel overproduction, and it is imperative to strive for exports. The only way is to intensify the control of the economy and strengthen military power. The former seeks temporary stability at home, and the latter is the backing for winning the market. In fact, what is revealed to us is not the lack of production, but the uneven distribution. Under this particularly difficult environment in our country, if we adopt free capitalism, it will only seek the interests of a few people. The Prime Minister has elaborated on this. If we adopt socialist economic policies, although Soviet Russia has achieved good results with this, China is in the international market dominated by international capitalism, it is inevitable that it will be difficult to succeed. The attempt to save the country must not be pinned on dreams. Only developing national capitalism is the only important plan, and it must be controlled by the state. The methods are: (1) Investigate what is lacking in the production index; (2) Investigate cash to clarify the national financial resources; (3) Pay attention to the development of national capital.</p>
<p>Under the condition that sovereignty and interests are not hindered, use foreign forces to assist in production. Recently, there have been two things that have caused misunderstandings among the people, namely borrowing money from the United States and cooperating with the League of Nations. The government has clearly declared the purpose of the former. Although there is obstruction from Japan in the latter, I hope that you will not believe its rumors, which will lead to speculation about handing over production undertakings to international co-management. In short, when the struggle between the great powers is becoming more acute and the Second World War is more imminent, we should develop national capital under state control in order to survive.

Armed police and others are stationed outside the parliament and government offices. Inquiries are made of guests very strictly.</p>
<p>National News Agency Dublin telegram on the 6th: The political situation in the Irish Free State has undergone extremely drastic changes in the past few days. It is expected that major events will occur in the near future. On one hand, the current head of government, Valera, controls the government and opposes elections. On the other hand, General O'Duffy, the leader of the Blue Shirts, is doing his best to advocate elections so that taxpayers have a say in all major national policies. The Blue Shirts have decided to hold a large parade this Sunday, and Valera has decided to prohibit it. Whether he will be able to prohibit it in the future, and whether there will be a conflict between the two sides, will be clear in a few days. The formal army, the Citizens' Defense Force, and the Irish Republican Army are all in Valera's hands. General O'Duffy was the former commander of the Citizens' Defense Force and had repeatedly fought with the British army. O'Duffy himself was in the ranks, so the formal army also greatly admired O'Duffy. Therefore, if a conflict occurs, will the formal army be able to stand against O'Duffy?</p>

It is rumored that the Blue Shirt Army has smuggled many weapons from foreign countries, including machine guns, pistols, etc. However, according to General O'Duffy, the Blue Shirt Army is not armed, and even the parade on Sunday will only carry small sticks.</p>

<p>National News Agency Strasbourg telegram on the 7th: After French aviators Rossi and Codou set off from New York on the morning of the 5th, although they carried a lot of oil, they made rapid progress. They did not encounter any other obstacles except for light wind and rain along the way. At 6 pm on the 6th, they had flown over Cherbourg, France, and were heading towards the Le Bourget airport outside Paris. At 8:20, they passed Paris and proceeded towards Munich, Germany. They passed Munich at midnight. According to the latest radio from the plane, they had arrived twenty miles south of Vienna at 1:50 am this morning and were advancing towards Belgrade. However, after the plane passed Munich, the Paris radio station received their radio, saying that there was an obstruction in the oil pipeline and they wanted a guide to guide them to the Alps. It is estimated that the oil pipeline has been repaired in the sky, so they went straight to Belgrade.</p>
<p>Havas Paris telegram on the 6th: Regarding the long-distance flight of Rossi and Codou, the newspapers here pointed out that the previous world record for the longest straight-line flight was 8,544 kilometers. According to the regulations of the International Aeronautical Federation, Rossi and Codou must fly more than 100 kilometers before they can be recognized as breaking the previous record. When the two flew over the Le Bourget airport, they had flown 5,780 kilometers. The remaining gasoline can still be used for three hours of flight. At a speed of 160 kilometers per hour, they can still fly 4,800 kilometers, totaling more than 10,000 kilometers, which is more than enough to break the world record.</p>

If they fail to reach the city, the attempt to break the record will fail. They sent out a radio message saying that the oil consumption was beyond normal, probably due to an oil wave leak. Vienna also received their latest report, stating that they had flown to Rhodes in the Aegean Sea, which is not far from the southern coast of Asia Minor. Reuters Paris telegram on the 7th: According to non-official news from Aleppo, the two French aviators flew over the city of Aleppo at 1:30 pm today.

<p>Berlin, August 6th (By Wireless from Platterschloss-Gartens): Today, German leader Adolf Hitler delivered a lengthy speech, lasting three hours, to key party members attending a meeting of local leaders. He discussed the economic, foreign, political, and domestic situations. He stated, "The restoration of domestic order is intimately related to Germany's position in the world. The power to govern the nation must be consolidated into a solid system, free from all external interference. The power of the Nazi movement must not be bound by any individual but must be built on a foundation that guarantees its permanent existence. Therefore, he proposes organizing a Senate comprised of senior and most trusted party members, from which will emanate the sacred authority of the leader." Hitler also said, "To return to our roots, the Nazi Party headquarters will henceforth be permanently located in Munich, and the annual Nazi Party Day commemoration will always be held in Nuremberg." He continued, "Regarding the economic problems the nation is currently facing, I will briefly describe our strategy for a frontal assault on the economic adversity, which will be carried out in three steps. The first step has already seen two million unemployed find work. The second step is scheduled to begin in September, with financial preparations already in place. This move aims to maintain the achievements of this summer. The third step will be implemented next spring, at which time unemployment will be further reduced." Hitler concluded by saying, "Looking to the future, it fills me with endless hope."</p>

<p>(Aiming to Eliminate Japanese Influence in the Northeast Within Six Years)</p>
<p>Harbin Special Dispatch: The five districts designated by the Hua Dong Republic are: (1) Central District, (2) Eastern Jilin District, (3) Eastern Heilongjiang District, (4) Eastern Liaoning District, and (5) Far East District. These five districts are not the definitively established territories of the Republic, but rather temporary military divisions to facilitate the separate promotion of the Republic's establishment. Not only the Chinese people, but all oppressed nationalities of the Far East are participating. The main purpose is to overthrow the puppet organizations fostered by the Japanese. The process is divided into two phases, each lasting three years. The first phase will focus on completing the construction of the Northeastern mountainous regions, overthrowing the puppet state's organization and construction, and simultaneously eliminating all Japanese military and political influence in the Northeast. It also includes organizing a genuinely popular nation and liberating all oppressed and weak nationalities. From July 1, 1936, the second phase will commence, taking advantage of the outbreak of the Second World War to gain belligerent status. Given that the war should not last more than three years, the Republic's territory will be twice the size of present-day Germany. With maximum effort, the Korean people can definitely achieve their liberation goals, after which they can engage in construction. According to those familiar with Guo Daofu, Guo now bears heavy political responsibilities for the Hua Dong Republic. Guo is a Dahuur Mongol and graduated from the First Middle School of Heilongjiang Province. He then went to the Russian Law and Politics School in Beijing. After graduating, he transferred to Peking University. Before graduating, he went to the Northeast to engage in revolutionary work. Later, he went to Russia for study and gained valuable insights. Upon returning to Outer Mongolia, he advocated national self-determination and sought to liberate the Mongolian people, organizing the Outer Mongolian Republic, and serving as Minister of the Interior. In 1928, he attempted independence in Hulunbuir and once came to Beijing, but the central government, due to various reasons, did not receive him. He then returned to Liaoning to found the Mongolian Banner Normal School, which achieved great success. Guo is now only forty years old, talented and knowledgeable, fluent in Chinese, Mongolian, English, Russian, and Japanese, and is known as the "Sage of Mongolia." (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<p>The Seemingly Strong But Inwardly Weak Commerce of Zhangshu</p>
<p>Zhangshu Special Dispatch: Zhangshu Town belongs to Qingjiang County. Its convenient transportation and developed commerce make it not only the economic center of Qingjiang (some have proposed moving the county seat here) but also a strategically important location controlling the two major river basins of the Gan River and Yuan River. The Gan-Yue highway line, running straight north-south, has a station here, further increasing its transportation convenience. Therefore, since the suppression of bandits began, elite troops have been stationed here regularly. In 1930, Zhu De and Mao Zedong led their main force to attack once, extorting 60,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce, but they were soon repelled by the National Army. Immediately, wooden walls, earthen walls, and outer moats were added to the defensive works. Recently, construction of bunkers and outer moats has begun, and barbed wire has been added (military obstacles). From now on, the defense of Zhangshu Town will be as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>The shops and stores in Zhangshu City are mostly three- or four-story cement buildings with glass windows and wax figure decorations, quite impressive. Walking from Zhongshan Gate straight to the large wharf on the Gan River, looking left and right, one might almost think one is on Dazhong Road in Jiujiang or Fourth Avenue in Shanghai. Its prosperity can be imagined. However, revealing the inner workings of its commerce, such as the sharp annual decline in trade volume and the invisible bankruptcies of stores, causes one to worry deeply about the future of its commerce. The rice-producing areas of Jiangxi province are mostly in the Gan and Yuan River basins, but all the rice is gathered here and then distributed to Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places, amounting to about 200,000 dan per year. Jiangxi is a major producer of medicinal herbs, and all herbs entering and leaving the province must also be collected here. The medicinal herb business has an annual trade value of over two million yuan. Other goods, such as timber, melon seeds, soybeans, wheat, and imported foreign goods, also each have an annual turnover of about one million yuan. Now, because various counties have been banditized, taxes and levies are frequent, and the people suffer from soldiers and bandits. The people's purchasing power has gradually declined, making it difficult for goods to come in and difficult for goods to go out. The annual volume of trade is less than one-third of what it used to be, and timber merchants have suffered particularly heavy losses. The number of unemployed people in the county has reached ten thousand. The shops in Zhangshu City may appear prosperous on the outside, but this is not true prosperity in business. Rather, it is competition in promotion. The expenses exceed the income in eight or nine out of ten cases. High-interest loans are even more prevalent than in the countryside. Among those whose businesses are losing money, debts are piling up, and even if they want to formally declare bankruptcy, they cannot. Last year, there were still fifteen money shops, some with capital of up to 200,000 yuan, but after only one year, they have all collapsed, leaving only eight. There are also many other businesses that cannot open and cannot close.</p>
<p>The county levies as many as twenty-one different taxes and levies, not counting the regular land tax. These include doorplate tax, porter tax, airplane surveying tax, telephone tax, Jishui bridge tax, defense tax, "iron shoulder" team tax, highway tax, soldier allowance tax, grain storage tax, chamber of commerce tax, aviation tax, bunker tax, baojia tax, wooden wall tax, volunteer team tax, superstition tax (only levied on Taoist priests, etc.), stamp tax (each business must affix a certain amount each month), public security fee (in Zhangshu Town, it is paid from prostitution tax), opium suppression tax (only levied on those with opium addiction who have obtained an opium suppression license from the Special Tax Bureau), and dike construction tax. The amount of money to be paid for each of the above taxes and levies, as well as whether to pay all of them or only some of them, varies depending on the time and place.</p>
<p>This is not only the case in one county. All counties near bandit areas are the same. As for what Zhangshu Town pays, according to the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, since 1926, it has been up to 120,000-130,000 yuan at most each year, and at least 20,000-30,000 yuan. There are also requisitions of goods (such as hay, sacks, hoes, boats, etc.), which are not included.</p>
<p>In 1930, the Red Bandits attacked Zhangshu. Mao Zedong, resembling a cook, gave a speech on the stage of the Tianhou Palace, bewitching the people. Later, the Chamber of Commerce, using the name of the local community, pawned goldware at the Huili and Binxing public pawnshops (the pawned items) and raised 60,000 yuan in silver dollars at a price of fifty taels, which was given to the Red Army. Although a catastrophe of burning, killing, and destruction was avoided at that time, the suffering of the townspeople when they raised the original items at a gold price of sixty or seventy taels afterward cannot be fully described in a few words.</p>
<p>The prostitution tax is about 18-19 yuan per prostitute per month. During peak months, a total of 800-900 yuan is collected, while during slow months, only half that amount is collected. Opium smoking licenses are handled by the Jiangxi Office of the Hubei Special Tax Bureau. Each license costs five yuan and is limited to one person, with the fee doubling each subsequent half-year period. Zhangshu Town has two opium dens. It is said that each den pays a license fee of 400 yuan, as well as various fees for stamps, safekeeping, transportation, and anti-smuggling.</p>
<p>The exact amount of each of these fees is unknown. Zhangshu Town has a population of over 20,000, with smokers accounting for about 5% of the population. Some say that if only the male population is counted, it is probably more than that. If this trend continues, it is tantamount to suicide. Discussing this, knowledgeable people cannot help but feel chilled. (August 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Southern Route Army to Besiege Junmenling <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Bandits Stationed at Junmenling Led by Ye Jianying)</p>
<p>(The Southern Route Army Advances with Elite Troops)</p>
<p>Shantou Telegram: Junmenling in Jiangxi Province, located in Huichang County, is an important market town for land trade between the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, and has long been occupied by the Communist Party as a base for harassing the borders of Fujian and Guangdong. When the Second Column of the Southern Route Army initially attacked Xunwu a few days ago, the Communist bandit Ye Jianying immediately stationed troops on the ridge to support the bandits of Changting and Xunwu. Ye is a native of Meixian, Guangdong, and is a key figure in the bandit group. He is currently the Commander-in-Chief and Principal of the Pseudo-Military Political Protection Training Corps and Military Academy. Recently, the main forces of Zhu De and Mao Zedong's Pseudo-135th Army Corps gathered in the mountains on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, planning to resist the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army. Therefore, Ye Jianying was assigned to station at Junmenling to provide support. However, the opponents of the Southern Route Army who fought against Ye were also natives of Meixian, namely Huang Renhuan, the commander of the First Independent Division, Huang Yanzhen, the commander of the Seventh Division, and Huang Zhiwen, the commander of the Eighth Division. They are all quite familiar with the terrain of the mountains on the border of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. Because Ye's tactics are fierce and he often uses desperate measures and takes risks, the Southern Route Army is advancing step by step. Huang Zhiwen's division of Xunwu and Jitan has been fighting fiercely with the main force of Ye's Pseudo-12th Division since July 15th. Huang Yanzhen came to the rescue via Xiangshan, and Huang Renhuan came to the rescue via Luotang, engaging in extremely fierce battles. Ye's bandits finally retreated to Huichang on the 18th due to exhaustion of ammunition and food. Another unit retreated north from Chengjiangxu, passing through Xitou, Wuping, and was intercepted by Ye Weihou's brigade of Huang Renhuan's unit, killing forty or fifty male and female bandits, capturing three male bandits and seven female bandits, and seizing twelve rifles. Currently, the territory of Xunwu County has been gradually cleared, but Ye's bandits are still gathered on the line of Junmenling and Huichang, with the determination to defend to the death. On the 28th, the entire unit of Huang Yanzhen also entered the Wanyu and Jitan area from Pingyuan. The defense of Pingyuan was taken over by Deng Hui's unit of the Training Corps. The armies are converging on Junmenling and advancing cautiously. The greatest goal is to support the 19th Route Army in besieging Changting. If Junmenling is taken back by the Southern Route Army, the bandits of Changting will be threatened. If Changting falls, the Fujian-Guangdong armies can be connected in a straight line, and the puppet capital of Ruijin can be attacked. The Fifth Squadron of the Air Force stationed in Meixian has flown to Jiaoling, and Meixian is also preparing to build a large barracks that can accommodate two regiments. It is expected that there will be a fierce battle on Junmenling. (August 2nd)</p>

<p>Since Warden Su took office at the county jail, he has eliminated abuses such as corrupt practices and gangsterism. The dark hell is gradually seeing the light of day. Last month, fifty sentenced prisoners were sent from Suzhou, most of whom were from Anhui and had been bandits in the Taihu area. They were extremely fierce, and weak prisoners were often bullied and oppressed in every way. Recently, three of the most vicious criminals, Kong Xiaoheshang, Gu Mingxin, and Zhao Heiyu, dared to meet with the jail supervisors and request to be appointed as head prisoners so that they could openly extort new prisoners. Supervisor Su informed them that head prisoners had long been abolished here and rejected their request. The criminals then secretly incited the prisoners and, taking advantage of the opportunity to open the cells yesterday, suddenly created a disturbance and assaulted the guard Jiang Faming, threatening to gouge out his eyes. The situation was tense. Guard Jiang shouted for help. Supervisor Su reported to the county government and the procuratorate. Subsequently, the county government dispatched twenty police officers, and the court also sent Prosecutor Zhu to provide guidance. With the suppression of the police, Guard Jiang's danger was resolved. It is understood that Supervisor Su has submitted a document to the county government for review.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 6th, a young traveler arrived at the New World Hotel on Tongyun Road, claiming to be Lian Dequan, a native of Zhenru, 19 years old, and a timber merchant. He opened room number 63. Unexpectedly, after entering the room, Lian immediately closed the door and swallowed four opium pills. By about 11 o'clock, the poison had taken effect. The tea attendant noticed and reported to the bookkeeper, who carried him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, because he had been poisoned deeply, he died on the way. His body was then carried to the Hotel Association on Dongxin Road, and the relevant Public Security Second Branch was notified to send police to the hotel to inspect his belongings. There was a suicide note addressed to Hua Mingfu of Hengfengxiang Timber Company outside Qimen, Suzhou, signed by Lian Jizhi. The letter stated the reason for the suicide, saying that he was under financial pressure and could not have freedom in marriage. The hotel telegraphed Suzhou and reported it to the court, which went to inspect the body on the morning of yesterday.</p>

<p>The case of Zhu Youfu's home at No. 8 Datong Bridge outside Wangjiangmen in Hangzhou being robbed of more than 200 silver dollars on the evening of the 30th of last month has been reported in this newspaper. After the case occurred, Director He ordered the detectives to solve the case within five days. Detective Zhou Kang, accompanied by Wang Fugen, a member of the Wangjiangmen Outer Security Corps, arrested the criminal Wang Dehui in the case at Erliangting at 1:20 pm the day before yesterday. Under interrogation by Captain Tang Shihhu, Wang confessed directly to carrying a gun to commit the robbery, but said that he only received 23 yuan of the loot. Eighty-five yuan of counterfeit banknotes from the Bank of Communications, ten yuan of counterfeit banknotes from the Central Bank, and fourteen two-jiao counterfeit banknotes were found on him. He also confessed that the wooden-cased gun was hidden at Li Guocai's place, so Li was also arrested. Wang Dehui had stayed in room number 2 of the Yongan Hotel in Xinshi Market for a few days after the robbery. Therefore, Captain Tang, for the sake of caution, immediately summoned the victim Zhu Youfu and the tea attendant Lu Jintang of the Yongan Hotel to the case to testify. They confirmed that the criminal had first entered with a gun and restrained the old woman before committing the robbery. Tea attendant Lu Jintang also testified that the criminal Wang Dehui had stayed at the hotel for a few days. After further questioning by Captain Zhu, it was confirmed to be accurate. Yesterday (the 7th) morning, he was sent to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Song Zheyuan Sends Telegram to Obey Orders and Take Charge of the Chahar Situation <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Huang Fu's Arrival in Shanghai Is to Handle Personal Affairs</p>
<p>Since the arrival of Song Zheyuan, the chairman of the Chahar Province government, in Shacheng, the negotiations have been quite satisfactory. Feng Yuxiang immediately issued a telegram, returning military and political power to the central government. The Chahar situation, which seemed to be on the verge of crisis, has thus come to an end. As for the aftermath, Chairman Song is solely responsible for handling it. Rumors that the focus of the Chahar situation has shifted to Shanghai and that Huang Fu will come to Shanghai to meet with Li Liejun to discuss concrete solutions to the Chahar situation are not accurate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan Shanghai Municipal Government received a telegram yesterday from Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province, stating: (Handling the aftermath) (Telegram truncated, briefly stating an invitation for inspection). After arriving in Chahar, General Feng stated in a telegram that Chahar Province had someone in charge and that all military and civilian affairs had been returned to the central government and that he would not interfere. Zheyuan will immediately obey orders and be responsible for handling everything. This telegram is respectfully submitted and awaits instructions. Song Zheyuan bows, Seal.</p>
<p>Huang Yingbai's Mission to Shanghai</p>
<p>It has been widely rumored in Shanghai that Huang Yingbai, Chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Beiping, will come to Shanghai to meet with Central Committee member Li Liejun to discuss concrete solutions. However, according to those close to Huang who have just arrived in Shanghai from Beiping, Mr. Huang does indeed intend to come to Shanghai, but it is to handle personal affairs and not to meet with Mr. Li to discuss solutions to the Chahar situation. This is because concrete solutions to the Chahar situation were agreed upon on the spot by Song Zheyuan in Shacheng, meeting with Feng Yuxiang's representatives, Sun Liangcheng and Tong Linge. There is no need for Huang to come to Shanghai to meet with Li.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Chairman Chiang's Reply Telegram Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>After Li Xiehe forwarded Feng's telegram to Wang and Chiang, he sent another telegram the next day inquiring about the concrete measures under the four principles. Yesterday, he received a reply telegram from Chiang, briefly stating that the concrete measures for the Chahar situation are under discussion and will be telegraphed again upon a decision. The most important measure for the aftermath is the placement of the more than 100,000 troops in Chahar Province who resisted Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Li Liejun Issues a Statement <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Since Li Xiehe telegraphed the central government to report Feng Huanzhang's telegram, Chairman Lin, Premier Wang, Director Yu, and Chairman Chiang have successively sent telegrams to Shanghai praising the matter and hoping that Li will continue his efforts. The Chahar situation is now showing signs of harmony. Correspondents from various news agencies visited Mr. Li at his private residence yesterday morning to inquire about everything. He issued the following statement: Since the Japanese invaders have driven into our country, who in the country is not indignant? Huanzhang's uprising in Zhangjiakou after the government reluctantly signed the agreement was not only courageous but also wise. Within a few dozen days, people flocked to him, and the disorderly masses became a disciplined army. Enemy generals surrendered, and the people loved him. Those with ambition thought of returning to him. Therefore, he was able to recover four counties with a proclamation and capture Duolun in one battle. This is rare in modern history. The whole country admires him. Therefore, it is right. The government is responsible for defending the land and did not willingly lose it. It was because it wanted to plan before acting that it could not support Huanzhang's actions. Such is the state of the nation. It is also unfortunate. The disaster of civil war is even worse. I admire Huanzhang's courageous action and unwillingness to compromise in the face of difficulty, and I also appreciate the government's patience and forbearance. Therefore, I gave the government unwelcome advice and waited for the opportunity to act for Huanzhang. Now they have been adopted. This is not only my personal fortune. Now that Huanzhang has accepted the proposals of Wang and Chiang, he has also returned political power to Song. Huanzhang has done everything that he should have done. However, Huanzhang cannot ignore the more than 100,000 patriotic soldiers who resisted Japan. How will they be treated well and kept in reserve for the future to restore the country and avenge the shame of the nation? Therefore, I emphasized this point in my previous telegram to the government and Chairman Chiang. I also said that the government should regard Huanzhang as the Great Wall and give him great power to take on important responsibilities. Soon, I received a reply telegram from Mr. Chiang agreeing with my view and forwarding it to the central government. This matter is still under discussion. Whether it is handled in the front or negotiated separately, the big things have been turned into small things, and the small things have been turned into nothing. Our hope is not only to seek peace in the Chahar situation but also to properly plan for the stability of the whole country. Therefore, the government's future measures may have to adhere more to the scope of democratic politics.</p>

He then went to Qingdao to avoid the summer heat. Now that the Shanghai Consulate General has completed its renovations and is scheduled to officially move in and operate within the month, Ambassador Bogomolov must personally come to Shanghai for inspection. He arrived in Shanghai on the 6th from Qingdao on the Japanese shipping company's Qingdao Maru. Russian consulate officials welcomed him at the dock. The Russian Ambassador landed and went directly to the Russian Embassy office on Xinzha Road to rest. He will stay in Shanghai for a while and has no plans to travel elsewhere.</p>

<p>Ma Gushan stayed at Moganshan for quite some time, and the commemorative album of the anti-Japanese war record will soon be published. After the former Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Pu, went to Hangzhou, he went to Moganshan to visit General Ma Zhanshan and reported on some matters. He finished his official duties the night before last and returned to Shanghai. Last night, he took the night train to Beijing to prepare for the relief of refugees from the Northeast. The reporter from the Central News Agency met with Mr. Lang and had the following conversation:</p>
<p>(Recent Situation of Mr. Ma in Moganshan)</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lang, the climate of Moganshan is quite cool. Since General Ma arrived in Moganshan, his health has gradually recovered. I received the sad news of Deng Wen's murder and immediately sent a telegram to Moganshan to report to General Ma. Before General Ma could finish translating the telegram, he was already in tears. Deng had followed General Ma for more than ten years and had been very hardworking. This time, upon hearing the sudden news of Deng's murder, he was extremely saddened, which caused his liver fire to rise and his left eye to become red and swollen. General Zhang Dianjiu's neck had previously suffered from boils, but now it has completely healed. As reported in the news, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially sent Gao Lingbo to Moganshan to urge General Ma to join the Military Affairs Commission, but I have not heard of this. General Ma will stay in Moganshan for a longer period of time if there is no need to do otherwise, and will not go elsewhere for the time being.</p>
<p>(Deng's Department Sends Personnel South) After Deng Wen's murder, a total of more than thirty members of his family have arrived in Peiping and are temporarily residing with Deng's department. Two representatives have been sent, meeting in Zhangyuan, and heading south. They passed through Peiping on the 6th and will arrive in Shanghai on the 8th, then proceed to Moganshan to meet with General Ma and report on everything. The truth about Deng's murder should be fully clarified within a few days. General Ma previously sent a representative, Mr. Wu Huanzhang, to Lushan to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and he will also return east to report on his mission within a few days.</p>
<p>(Taking the Train to Beijing Last Night) I am scheduled to take the night train to Beijing tonight to attend the preparatory meeting for the relief of refugees from the Northeast. The office here has already announced the consolation donations from all walks of life, and has also submitted a request to the central government for the resettlement of civil and military officials. Currently, the resumes of the fallen soldiers are being investigated, and the anti-Japanese war operations are being recorded. A commemorative album will soon be published to mark the occasion. After I leave Shanghai, all matters here will be handled by Secretary-General Zhou, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Yu Shun Steamer That Was Robbed Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Sixteen Crew Members and Others Are Suspected of Colluding with Bandits and Were Arrested in Shantou; Three Kidnapped People Are Missing; Total Loss Is Approximately Over Ten Thousand Yuan. The China Merchants Bureau's Yu Shun Steamer Was Robbed Last Month in Southern Shantou by Bandits Disguised as Passengers and Fled to Haifeng. Before Leaving, They Also Kidnapped Three Staff Members and Passengers. It Was Later Discovered That the Steamer's Crew Was Suspected of Colluding With Bandits. When Returning to Shantou, Military Police Arrested Sixteen Crew Members and Others. The Steamer Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Docked at Jinliyuan Wharf. The Detailed Circumstances Are Recorded Below:</p>
<p>(Warning Before Departure and Robbery Process) The Yu Shun Steamer Sailed From Guangzhou Last Month. An Alert Had Been Received in Advance Stating That the Crew Was Colluding With Bandits and Attempting to Rob the Ship. Military Police Conducted an Inspection, But Found Nothing Suspicious. Therefore, It Departed On Time. On the Morning of the 31st of Last Month, It Arrived in Shantou Via Hong Kong and Unloaded Goods as Usual. At 6 PM That Evening, It Departed From Shantou to Xiamen. Unexpectedly, Before It Had Sailed Thirty Miles South of Shantou, Pirates Who Had Been Lying in Ambush in the Hold Immediately Launched an Attack. Because No Shots Were Fired and No Special Signals Were Made, the Crew Was Caught Off Guard and the Bandits Broke Into the Bridge. Another Group of Pirates Invaded the Engine Room and the Radio Room, Destroying the Electrical Machinery With Axes. Then They Drove the Crew and Passengers Into the Stern Hold and Imprisoned Them. They Forced the Engine Room Personnel to Sail to Haifeng. After Three Robberies Overnight, They Arrived in Haifeng at Noon the Next Day. The Pirates Seized a Fisherman's Sailboat, and Transferred the Kidnapped Victims and Stolen Goods to the Sailboat, And Escaped to Honghai Bay. After the Yu Shun Steamer Saw the Pirates Escape, It Turned Back to Shantou and Arrived at 7 AM on the Second. At That Time, Because the Crew Was Suspected of Colluding With Bandits, It Was Reported to the Shantou Military Police, Who Arrested and Interrogated Them. The Arrested Crew Members Were Li Shaoting, Li Guocheng, Chen Shengguan, Xu Yaoke, Xie Aqi, Li Chengren, Lu Ajin, Qian Ashun, Zhou Jinzhang, Jiang Baosheng, Hu Ahong, All Ningbo People; Accountant Fang Jinhuai; Passenger Solicitor Cai Huatang; and Three Passengers. After Clearing the Ship, The Yu Shun Steamer Sailed to Xiamen On the 4th and Departed From Xiamen to Shanghai On the 5th, Arriving in Shanghai at 7:30 AM Yesterday. It Docked at Jinliyuan Wharf.</p>
<p>(Three Robberies, Loss of Ten Thousand Yuan) The Pirates' Intention to Rob the Yu Shun Steamer Was Based on the Rumors in Guangdong That Three Wealthy People Were Taking The Ship to Shanghai With a Large Amount of Money. Therefore, After Launching the Attack, They Only Focused on Valuables and Not on Goods. There Were 150 Passengers and 3,132 Pieces of Cargo On The Ship. The Passengers' Valuables Could Not Be Avoided, and Only Two Boxes of Silverware (Table Settings) Were Taken From the Cargo. Because They Did Not Find a Large Amount of Money, They Were Unsatisfied, So They Involved the Crew, Creating a New Record in Maritime Robbery History. According to the Crew Who Witnessed It, The Robbery Was Divided Into Three Stages: The First Time Was for Money, the Second Time Was for Clothes, and the Third Time Was a Thorough Search, Even the Bedding Was Taken. The Total Loss, Excluding the Passengers, Was 400 Yuan for Ship Owner Huang Hongqian, 1,200 Yuan for the Chief Officer, Englishman Nelson, Approximately One Hundred Yuan for The Three Compardores Jin Chunxun, and Five of the Chief Officer's Six Pairs of Leather Shoes Were Gone. The Remaining Pair Was Spared Because They Were Old and Broken. The Total Loss Was Approximately 10,000 Yuan.</p>
<p>(Sixteen Pirates Escaped to Haifeng) According to The Yu Shun Steamer's Second Mate Shen Quanhai, There Were a Total of Sixteen Pirates. The Pirate Leader Was a Cripple, Said to Be The One Who Robbed The Guangli Steamer Previously. He Hid His Pistol In His Leggings. The Shantou Police Paid Attention to The Luggage, But Did Not Check His Body, So He Was Able to Get On The Ship. Most of The Pirates Were Wearing Blue and Black Silk Cloth Shirts and Pants, and There Were Approximately Ten Guns. Because They Stole and Robbed Without Firing and Injuring Anyone, Chief Officer Nelson, Helmsman Xin Jincai, and The Others of Us Were Robbed and Humiliated. The Pirates Wanted to Force Us to Hand Over Firearms, But We Did Not Carry Self-Defense Pistols. Most of The Pirates Spoke The Chaozhou Dialect, But Some Spoke The Ningbo Dialect. The Pirate Leader Was A Lame Man Close to Forty Years Old, Extremely Fierce. After Launching The Robbery at 9:05 PM That Night, He Forced The Engine Room to Sail to Haifeng. At Midnight, He Ordered The Stewards to Prepare Meals. They Intercepted Ships Three Times Along The Way, Firing Two Shots. At Noon On The First, They Intercepted a Fishing Boat For The Third Time. In Less Than An Hour, They Transferred to The Boat and Escaped to Honghai Bay. Haifeng Was Originally a Place Where Pirates Gathered. Da'ao Bay Is Their Main Nest, and Honghai Bay Is Just a Small Den.</p>
<p>(The Accountant and Crew Are Suspected of Colluding With Bandits) Later, The Reporter Met With The Yu Shun Steamer's First Mate Chen Bangda At The China Merchants Bureau. According to Him, The Total Loss of The Yu Shun Steamer Was Estimated at 10,000 Yuan. After The Pirates Arrived at Honghai Bay, They Escaped Towards Nuomo Mountain (Namoai). Of The Three Kidnapped People, One Was Huang Zanmin, a Staff Member of The Comprador's Office (Also Known as Huang Jiayan), From Chongming. The Other Two Were Mo Guocui, a Military Training Student From Yushan Middle School, and Shen Zhenxin, From Guangdong Provincial First Middle School, Who Were Both Coming to Shanghai and Then Going to Peiping to Transfer Schools. Their Whereabouts Are Still Unknown. All Crew Members Arrested in Shantou Are Currently Being Detained in Shantou for Interrogation. Of The Passengers Coming to Shanghai Today, Approximately Fifty Arrived in Shanghai, With Some Returning to Shantou. The Head Office Temporarily Issued Subsistence Allowances to The Crew Who Were Robbed. Yu Shun Has Decided to Resume Normal Operations to Qingdao On The Morning of The 9th.</p>
<p>(No One Dared to Claim The Thousand-Yuan Check) During This Pirate Robbery of The Yu Shun Steamer, A Check For 1,700 Yuan Was Found in Someone's Suitcase While Robbing The Passengers' Luggage. At That Time, All The Passengers Were Locked Together in The Main Dining Room. When The Pirates Obtained This Check, They Did Not Know Whose It Was. Therefore, They Pretended to Ask The Passengers, Willing to Return The Check. After Asking For a Long Time, The Owner Did Not Come Forward to Claim It, So They Tore It to Pieces In Anger and Threw It Into The Sea. It Was Later Found That The Check Belonged to Lu Jianhua, a Merchant From Fujian. He Did Not Dare to Claim It Because He Was Afraid That The Pirates Would Know That He Had Money and Take Him Along, Extorting a Large Sum. He Was Indeed Wise.</p>
<p>(China Merchants Bureau Reforms Business System) Ship Owner Huang Hongqian Arrived in Shanghai and Reported the Incident to Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, and Zhao Yuntai, Head of the Shipping Department. The Crew's Losses Will Be Compensated After the Situation Is Clarified. Therefore, Yu Shun Is Still Scheduled to Sail to Qingdao to Unload Goods on the 9th as Usual. However, Liu Hongsheng Believes That This Incident Could Not Be Prevented, Which Was Due to the Deficiencies in the Business System. He Is Determined to Abolish the Comprador System, and the Stewards and Laborers Will Be Employed by the Bureau Itself, Similar to the Puan and Xinming Cases, in Order to Avoid Unexpected Events. On the One Hand, He Is Actively Seeking Preventive Measures, Which Are Currently Being Discussed and Handled by the Ministry of Communications. As for the Three Kidnapped People, Because It Is Impossible to Contact Them for the Time Being, and The China Merchants Bureau Has Not Been Able to Send Personnel to Contact Them on Behalf of The Passengers, Their Whereabouts Are Still Unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e90">County Government Officials Issue Instructions Busily <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government Found That the Outstanding Taxes From Each District Were Still Huge, Especially in the Second District. Therefore, It Believed That the Tax Collector of That District, Zhu Jinsheng, Was Extremely Negligent. Therefore, He Was Arrested and Ordered to Recover the Taxes. Later, He Was Released on Bail Due to Illness While in Custody. Now, the County Government Believes That the Annual Taxes Should Be Collected From the First Day of This Month. Therefore, It Summoned Tax Collectors From Each District Yesterday and Issued Instructions. In Addition to Instructing Them on the Correct Amount of Taxes to Be Collected, It Also Told the Officials That, "Now Is the Time When the Province and County Are in Financial Difficulty. You Should Handle Your Duties Seriously and Not Be As Negligent As Before. As for the Outstanding Taxes From the Winter Season, You Should Urge Collection As Soon As Possible and Hand Them Over in Full." The Officials All Complied With the Instructions and Left.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Villagers Gather to Discuss Preventing the Opening of the Pu Hui Pond Dam <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>(Because It Does Not Follow the Original Plan of Six Zhang Wide at the River Surface, Two Zhang Wide at the River Bottom)</p>
<p>(Eight Chi Deep at the River Bottom)</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai West Pu Hui Pond Was Contracted Out by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works for Dredging in Sections, Sections 1 and 2 Have Been Completed. Sections 3, 4, and 5 Were Originally Scheduled to Be Inspected and Accepted the Day Before Yesterday. Later, Because All the Merchants and Residents of Hongqiao Town Requested the Bureau of Public Works to Order the Contractor, Shen Rongji, to Redredge According to the Original Size and Depth, in Order to Benefit Navigation and Achieve Complete Success, Now It Is Learned That the Contractor, Shen Rongji, Only Slightly Removed the Silt From the River Bottom and Dumped It on Both Sides of the Riverbank, Still Not Following the Original Plan of Six Zhang Wide at the River Surface, Two Zhang Wide at the River Bottom, and Eight Chi Deep at the River Bottom. Moreover, He Reduced the Earthwork and Tried to Deceptively Report to the Higher Authorities to Send Personnel to Inspect and Accept It, Hoping to Sell It Off. This Was Discovered by the Residents Along the River, Who Opposed It One After Another, Inviting Farmers to Discuss Preventing the Opening of the Dam. After Discussion, It Was Decided That (1) People Should Be Sent to Guard the Dam Foundation to Prevent Secret Opening (2) The Water From Each Tributary River Should Be Filled (3) The Bureau of Public Works Should Be Requested to Order the Contractor to Redredge (4) Before Redredging, Illegal Inspection and Acceptance Should Not Be Allowed.</p>

<p>Singapore Restricts the Entry of Chinese</p>
<h3 id="e92">Shipping Companies Dare Not Sell Tickets <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Since Mexico Expelled Overseas Chinese and Japan Banned Chinese Laborers From Entering the Country, Colonies of Various Countries Have Also Repeatedly Refused Entry to Our Compatriots. In This Vast World, There Is No Place for Our Chinese People to Stand. Now Singapore Is Said to Restrict the Entry of Chinese.</p>
<p>(Limiting the Number of Entries) British Singapore Has the Largest Number of Overseas Chinese Businessmen in Our Country, and Many Industries Are Operated by Chinese. There Has Never Been a Limit on Our Overseas Chinese Going to Singapore. Every Year, No Less Than 100,000 Overseas Chinese From Fujian and Guangdong Provinces Travel Back and Forth. Unexpectedly, the Singapore Authorities Suddenly Limited the Number of Chinese Entering the Country and Issued Residence Permits to Those Who Have Lived in Singapore for a Long Time. Without This Certificate, They Will Be Rejected for Being Over Quota and Not Allowed to Land. Recently, Many Batches of People Who Have Been Rejected and Sent Back Have Already Been Sent Back.</p>
<p>(Overseas Chinese Going to Singapore Are Blocked) The Italian Postal Shipping Company's Kang Tuo Fan Te Steamer, Which Was Going From Shanghai to Europe on Its Regular Route, Had Forty-Nine Chinese Passengers, Who Were Taking the Ship From Shanghai and Hong Kong to Singapore. Most of These Chinese Were Going for Business, or Were Originally Residing in Singapore, Returning Home for Business, and Then Going Back. When the Ship Arrived in Singapore, the Colonial Authorities Prohibited This Batch of Chinese From Entering the Country, Claiming That the Quota of Overseas Chinese Arriving in Singapore Had Been Reached, and None Were Allowed to Land. Later, After the Italian Postal Company Repeatedly Negotiated With the Singapore Authorities and Presented the Residence Permits of the Chinese, After Several Disputes, They Finally Agreed to Be Accommodating Once, and in the Future, They Would Not Be Allowed to Carry Chinese to Singapore Again.</p>
<p>(Telegram to Stop Carrying Chinese) On July 24, the Singapore Italian Postal Company Specially Sent a Telegram to Shanghai, Informing the Shanghai Branch That the Singapore Authorities Were Suppressing the Entry of Chinese and Limiting the Number of People. The Quota Was Now Full, and No More Chinese Were Allowed to Arrive in Singapore. Shanghai Was Ordered to Stop Selling Tickets to Chinese Going to Singapore. If They Disobeyed the Order and Carried Them, in Addition to Being Prohibited From Landing, the Colonial Government Would Also Punish the Shipping Company. After This Telegram Arrived in Shanghai, There Were Major Obstacles for Chinese Taking Ships to Singapore.</p>
<p>(Difficulty Purchasing Tickets) After This Suppression Order Arrived in Shanghai, It Has Become Difficult for Chinese in Shanghai to Go to Singapore. Shipping Companies Are Afraid to Sell Tickets Rashly. If Passengers Insist on Buying Tickets, Unless They Prepay 1,000 Singapore Dollars to Be Used as a Fine When Prohibited From Landing, There Is No Other Way. Yesterday, the Manager of the Italian Postal Company Specially Went to the British Consulate in This Port to Ask Whether Chinese Could Be Allowed to Go to Singapore. On the One Hand, Only Those With Residence Permits Were Allowed to Sell Tickets to Singapore, But Only One or Two People Were Allowed, and More Would Result in Stopping Sales.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Settlement of Post-Disaster Issues of the Goutan Steamer's Workers Has Been Successfully Resolved <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>

It Has Just Been Learned That These Measures Were Highly Commended by the Ministry. The Committee Received Order No. 1445 From the Ministry of Communications Yesterday, and Immediately Informed the China Merchants Bureau to Comply With It. It Also Notified All Family Members and Surviving Workers That Certificates Issued by the Association Were Required to Receive Compensation, Otherwise, They Would Not Be Valid, in Order to Show Solemnity and Prevent Impersonation. The Details Are Recorded Below:</p>
<p>(Notice to Family Members) Regarding the Post-Disaster Measures for the Goutan Steamer's Workers and Deceased Family Members, This Association Has Formulated Measures and Submitted Them to the Ministry of Communications for Approval. It Is Estimated That Each Deceased Family Member Will Receive a Compensation of Six Hundred and Sixty Yuan, Including All Losses, Burial Expenses, and Other Expenses. Each Deceased Worker Will Receive Compensation of One Hundred and Sixty Yuan, Including All Property and Loss of Employment. All Family Members Who Have Received a Portion of the Compensation From the China Merchants Bureau Are Requested to Come to the Association to Re-Register in Order to Receive the Compensation Certificate and Hold It to the China Merchants Bureau to Receive the Compensation That Is Due. All Family Members and Workers Who Have Not Received It Should Register at the Post-Disaster Association, Which Will Be Collected and Reported Again Before Issuing It. However, for the Sake of Caution, No Compensation Can Be Received From the Bureau Without a Compensation Certificate Issued by This Association. This Is Specially Notified.</p>
<p>(Nuclear Instructions From Ministry of Communications) The Measures Submitted Are Generally Appropriate. They Are Revised Separately as Follows: (1) The Compensation for the Family Members of Sailors Who Died While Performing Ship Duties Should Be Handled in Accordance With the Provisions of Article 67 of the Maritime Law, But If Their Annual Wages Are Less Than 660 Yuan, They Should Be Paid According to 660 Yuan, Including All Losses, Burial Expenses, and Other Expenses. (2) Surviving Sailors Should Be Given a Loss Fee of 160 Yuan, Including All Property and Loss of Employment. (3) When the Bureau Has Vacancies for Deceased Sailors, They Should Be Given Priority for Recruitment.</p>

<p>Seven members of the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee, including Wang Yongsheng, had previously taken their oath of office in Beijing. However, members Yang Hu and Lin Yinsheng were unable to attend due to other engagements. They specially held a supplementary oath of office ceremony at the Security Bureau yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. The details are as follows:</p>

Should I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This I swear.</p>
<p>(Mr. Wang's Speech) After the oath was taken, supervisor of the oath Wang Luyi gave a speech, stating that the mass movement led by our party aims to liberate the people from suffering, relieve the people from oppression, and enable everyone to enjoy equality and freedom. Seamen, in the past, suffered from disorganization, leading to various disputes. Now, the Central Government has ordered the establishment of a preparatory committee to seek unified organization. Members Yang and Lin have a long history with the seamen and possess a spirit of sacrifice for the revolution. In the future, they should work to unite the seamen internally and relieve their suffering, and so on.</p>
<p>) Guest Speeches (Zhong Xiqiao, representative of the Shanghai Seamen's Union Steering Committee, gave a speech, stating that the reason the Seamen's Guild had so many disputes in the past was due to the lack of leadership. Now that the Central Government has ordered the establishment of a preparatory committee, it can be organized soundly under unified leadership. Zhou Xuexiang, representative of the General Labor Union, also gave a speech, stating that the labor movement has reached a dead end today, often not being controlled by the workers themselves but instead being dominated by hooligans. He hopes that everyone will pay attention to this opportunity.</p>
<p>(Mr. Yang's Reply) Member Yang Hu, who took the oath, gave a reply, saying, "I am deeply grateful for the guidance of guests from all walks of life and the central supervisor of the oath. The organization of the Chinese Seamen's Union is vast, and its undertakings are complex. We must work hard with a spirit of sacrifice. The points we should strive for in the future are: 1. To unite the seamen internally to seek our own liberation; 2. To develop the national shipping industry and reclaim the right to navigate inland rivers; 3. To improve the treatment of seamen as much as possible without hindering the shipping industry itself."</p>
<h3 id="e96">Construction Commission Continues to Issue Six Million in Electrical Bonds <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>(Issuance methods have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review) (Secured by the Capital Qishuyan Power Plant) Three principles have been decided for use and distribution The National Government Construction Commission previously issued long-term bonds of 1.5 million yuan and short-term bonds of 2.5 million yuan to develop the Capital and Qishuyan power plants. It is now learned that although state-owned electrical enterprises have made great progress in recent years, they are constrained by economic difficulties, and some projects that should be undertaken have not been implemented. To gradually implement the government's construction plan, the commission plans to continue issuing bonds worth 6 million yuan. According to sources in the city's banking sector, the bond issuance methods have been detailed by the commission and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review, after which they will be announced. The face value of the bonds will be 1,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%. Interest will be paid on June 30th and October 31st each year, secured by the address, buildings, machinery, and profits of the Capital and Qishuyan power plants. The principles for use and distribution have been determined as: 1. Opening the Huainan Power Plant, as the Construction Commission has a coal mine nearby that will require a large amount of electricity when developed on a large scale in the future, so it has been decided to build a power plant there to meet the needs. 2. Expanding the Qishuyan Power Plant by purchasing additional generators, increasing electricity production, and promoting small-scale electricity businesses. 3. Reorganizing the Capital Electric Light Plant by extending power lines as much as possible so that electricity can circulate everywhere.</p>

<p>Meaning in the oil painting Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji, to commemorate the 19th Route Army's resistance against the Japanese in Shanghai and Songhu, specially allocated 8,000 yuan from the Ministry of Military Affairs several months ago to convert the original dining hall on the right side of the ministry into the One-Two-Eight Memorial Hall. A garden called the One-Two-Eight Garden was built around the hall, with a pavilion in the center called the One-Two-Eight Memorial Pavilion. A stone tablet was erected behind the hall, engraved with a commemorative text, signed by Dai, for eternal commemoration. Inside the hall, on the front wall, is a very large oil painting, with the Zhabei Commercial Press and the Zilai Pavilion as the background. In the front line is the solemn line of our army, and in the rear are enemy planes flying and dropping bombs, with smoke and fire covering the sky, truly inspiring people to reflect and strive. It is now learned that the oil painting has been completed, and Commander Dai has specifically scheduled the inauguration ceremony for the 10th of this month, when there will be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Taxpayers' Association Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Department, Urging the Telephone Company to Respect Public Opinion <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Quickly abolish the five-cent call fee to facilitate traffic The abolition of the five-cent call fee for Chinese concessions has been eagerly awaited by the general public. However, although the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has expressed its intention to abolish it automatically, the Shanghai Telephone Company has still failed to adapt to the trend. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday urged the Public Works Department again on this matter, requesting the company to respect public opinion, and replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce) In reply to your association's letter No. 3246 of August 3rd, regarding the unanimous mobilization to urge the Shanghai Telephone Company to follow the Shanghai Telephone Bureau in abolishing the call fee between the area under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Special Zone. We have received this. The purpose of a telephone is to facilitate traffic. Within the same city area, although the managing organization may be allowed to be more than two, restricting communication between users fails to fully realize its effectiveness. It is said that abolishing the five-cent call fee between the area under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Special Zone will increase the burden on users who do not need this type of call fee, which is unfair. This is an untenable argument. May we ask whether the number of times a user with the same usage fee uses the telephone is the same? This association believes that abolishing this call fee will further promote fairness and convenience among users. It is said that those who refuse to abolish this call fee are actually doing so for private gain and are using the argument that unequal treatment will occur among users as a pretext. This association does not believe it. It concerns the convenience of traffic and the necessity of developing municipal administration. We hereby request your bureau to quickly order the Shanghai Telephone Company to abolish the aforementioned five-cent call fee to show respect for the purpose of operating a telephone franchise. We have now received the above. In addition to sending another letter to the Public Works Department urging them to order the Shanghai Telephone Company to implement it quickly, we hereby reply for your information. To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>(Letter to the Public Works Department) We previously sent a letter on July 15th regarding facilitating telephone traffic, requesting your bureau to quickly order the Shanghai Telephone Company to abolish the five-cent call fee for calls between the North and South Municipalities to show respect for the purpose of operating a franchise. We have not yet received a reply, which is greatly anticipated. Now that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has been approved to implement it, we believe that your bureau will be able to respect public opinion and facilitate traffic, not falling behind others. As we have not yet received a reply informing us of the handling situation, we hereby send another letter, hoping that you will quickly order the matter to be handled. To the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Resolution of Dispute Over Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Tobacco, Alcohol, and Sauce Association previously stated that Director Ding Xie (Jin Sheng) of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office, due to taking on the responsibility of collecting this tax, had increased the quota, making the burden already heavy. It was proposed to change the two-yuan license for the tobacco and alcohol industries to four yuan, with similar increases for others, otherwise, the losses would be severe. After repeated consultations with the leaders of the two industries, a decision could not be reached. The tax side agreed to allow members to be flexible as appropriate. As a result of negotiations between the two sides, payment will still be made according to the usual practice. The Tonghui notified members that the dispute had been resolved from now on, and all shops should entrust the association to pay the autumn licenses on their behalf. Thirty-six shops were obstructed and instructed to add more. The association again notified member shops not to start disputes again. Upon questioning the person in charge of the association, yesterday, Zhang Dalian of the Sauce and Alcohol Industry Association sent representative Qian Dousheng to the South Railway Station License Tax Office at 10:00 AM, together with Qian Wenda and Chen Kunxian, the director and deputy director of the Shanghai South Office of the Tobacco Industry Association, for further negotiations. Directors Chen and Cheng of the office extended a meeting. Licenses for members will still be collected according to the regulations. Those who have been paid on behalf of the association will also be treated accordingly. If there are any alterations or mismatched grades, the association is requested to assist in dispatching personnel for investigation and persuasion. Non-members should not be accepted. The representatives then took their leave. The repeated disputes were completely resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Joint Association Telegraphs Request to Dismiss the Chief of the Shangbao Branch Bureau <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department and the Director of the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, stating that on the 6th of this month, a letter from the Shanghai Shaoxing Wine Industry Association stated that, according to the previous Jiangsu Public Monopoly Regulations, all Shaoxing wine transported from Zhejiang and sold in other provinces should be reported to the Shanghai collection agency, specifying the quantity, and after the goods and documents are verified to be consistent, a stamp should be affixed for release, without obstruction. It is now reported by Pan Yangsheng of De Tai Chang Shaoxing Wine Shop that on July 17th, 500 jars of Beijing-grade Jia Da Shaoxing wine were transported from Zhejiang and sold in Beiping. According to the regulations, it should still be</p>
<p>reported to the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Branch Bureau, and after the goods and documents are verified to be consistent, a stamp should be affixed for release, which is the proper procedure. However, the newly appointed Chief of the Shangbao Branch Bureau, Huang Yong (Huang Yuming), stated that according to the new tax regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on July 1st, wine passing through the area must pay the new tax, otherwise, the goods would be confiscated and punished. Yangsheng argued with reason, but to no avail. The branch bureau detained all the wine declared to the customs and waiting to be loaded onto a sea vessel, causing delays and considerable losses. The merchant had no choice but to reluctantly pay the new tax of 3.4 cents per jar on the 18th, totaling 170 yuan. Furthermore, it was reported by Dong Sheng Qing Wine Shop that 70 jars of Jia Da wine transported from Shaoxing to Hou Sheng Shop in Dalian were also</p>
<p>taxed 16.8 yuan, and the Zhejiang tax票was confiscated, and a guarantee was provided. The details were reported to the association, and Jin Yunjie, a standing committee member, replied that according to the new regulations,</p>
<p>this type of wine does not require supplementary tax. If it is said that supplementary tax can be paid along the way, then the new tax is similar to a disguised likin tax. However, the Shangbao area has a wide market, ranking first in Jiangsu Province. It is assumed that the director, being a high-ranking official, must be familiar with the new regulations and would not make any mistakes. However, after checking Article 14 of the Ministry's regulations, there is no need to pay supplementary tax. It is feared that there are other detailed rules specifying the supplementary tax regulations, which are unknown. After requesting the department and bureau to explain clearly, a reply will be given. Soon after, Jin Changwu reviewed the situation and stated that only Article 14 of the new regulations</p>
<p>could be followed, and there are no other detailed rules for supplementary tax, and so on. It is found that Huang Yong, Chief of the Shangbao Branch Bureau, who holds the power of monopoly, is not familiar with the regulations and uses fraudulent means, relying on his power to implement coercion. This is enough to prove that he is imposing excessive taxes and levies, which cannot be denied. Merchants are difficult to endure. If the joint association is not requested to appeal to the Taxation Department and provincial authorities on behalf of the merchants, this tax revenue will be completely defrauded. Therefore, a factual report is submitted, requesting you to send a letter to the joint association, which will forward it to the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department and the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau for review to ascertain the truth, quickly refund the illegally levied tax, and dismiss and punish the Chief of the Bureau, Huang Yong, who illegally levies taxes, to rectify official conduct and ensure fairness. The report from the association also stated that, after reviewing the information, we found that the regulations clearly stipulate that wine transported from the place of origin to other provinces should be inspected and released without levying tax. The bureau chief holds a high position and should not act so ignorantly. Furthermore, withholding items requires special provisions according to the law. Now, at the time of reforming tax rates, he is undermining the Ministry's regulations, intensifying his actions, and levying taxes without authorization, violating criminal law. This is truly detrimental to official integrity. In addition to publishing a statement in the newspaper, the relevant circumstances are hereby sent to your association for review, hoping that you will forward them to the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department and the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau for verification, quickly dismiss the Chief of the Branch Bureau, Huang Yong, who illegally levies taxes, severely punish him, and refund the illegally levied tax in full, to rectify official conduct and show fairness. Upon receiving the report, it was found that, regardless of the new or old system, the inspection and release of Shaoxing wine passing through the area is required. At the beginning of the implementation of the new tax, the chief of the branch bureau dared to violate the regulations and extort taxes, giving others an excuse, and hindering the new policy. Whether this is meritorious or a mistake is clear to all. If he is not severely punished, how can those who follow suit be deterred? According to the previous letter, it is appropriate to telegraph this. We hope that you will review and approve this, quickly send personnel to investigate and handle the matter, and investigate the matter impartially, to warn those who are greedy and to reassure honest merchants. We also ask for instructions to be given so that we can inform you, and we will be extremely grateful. Joint Association of Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Alcohol Industry Association, Chairman Zhang Dalian, Standing Committee Members Jin Yunjie, Jin Jia, Dai Zhuoan, Chen Weiwen, Joint Association of Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco Industry Association, Chairman Chen Liangyu, etc.</p>

<p>Fuyang is surrounded by bandits The Anhui Fellow Villagers' Association telegraphed Nanchang Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Huangchuan Chief Commander Liu, and Anqing Acting Chairman Ma, stating that Fuyang is adjacent to Henan in the southwest, and bandits and communists have been causing disturbances for several months. They gather more and more each day, and the burning and looting become more tragic. Recently, they have launched a large-scale siege. It is learned that the city has only a small number of security teams, which are trapped inside the city. If the city falls, not only will the region suffer a severe disaster again, but the strength of the bandits will increase, which will affect the overall situation of bandit suppression. It is hoped that capable troops will be dispatched quickly to encircle and suppress the bandits to save the endangered city and prevent the spread of the situation.

<p>(Twelve people escorted from Tianjin to Shanghai were interrogated yesterday) (The backgrounds of the bandits are diverse, including principals and prostitutes) They committed many crimes in Shanghai and are currently under investigation. Geng Huatang, a notorious kidnapper from Jinan, is 58 years old this year. He previously served as a division commander. When He Fenglin was the Songhu Military Commissioner, Geng served as an adjutant in the Military Commissioner's office. After the Jiazi year Jiang-Zhe war, Geng left his post and lived in the French Concession. Due to financial difficulties, he engaged in kidnapping. After the case was uncovered, the French police published his photo in the newspapers and offered a reward for his arrest, but he was not caught. Because Geng could not establish himself in Shanghai, he fled to Tianjin, often secretly contacting his accomplices in Shanghai, still engaged in his old business, and after obtaining funds, he fled back to Tianjin.</p>
<p>In total, he has committed more than a dozen kidnapping cases in Shanghai. This time, Geng gathered his gang in Tianjin and organized a major kidnapping organization at No. 45 Liuzhifang, Mingshi Street, Japanese Concession, and resumed his old business. This was discovered by the Tianjin police, who telegraphed the Shanghai French police, who sent detectives to Tianjin and arrested Geng and 12 of his accomplices, male and female, and brought them to Shanghai. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the bandits to the Second Special Court, where Judge Li Changnian presided over the trial in the Criminal Division. The police brought the defendants to the court and first questioned them about their names, ages, hometowns, addresses, and occupations. According to Zheng Tangsheng (also known as Changsheng and Guansheng), 34 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 71 Baoding Road, Hongkou, engaged in the gold industry exchange. Yu Yuanzhou stated that he was 18 years old, from Tianjin, engaged in denture making. Chang Jianxi, 38 years old, from Anhui, working as a servant. Geng Huatang, 58 years old, from Jinan, engaged in selling calligraphy and paintings, residing at No. 45 Liuzhifang, Mingshi Street, Tianjin. Bian Zenghua, 40 years old, from Huaiyin, Jiangsu, working as a brakeman on the Jinpu Railway for nine years. Shang Zhen, 43 years old, from Kaifeng, Henan, served in the military's Fourth Army. Liu Yiming, 37 years old, from Yangzhou, residing in Dongcheng, Beiping, served as an adjutant in the Forty-first Army. Wang Tukong, 34 years old, from Sichuan, working as a principal in a Tianjin college. Li Yueshan, 33 years old, from Anhui, engaged in selling materials. Zheng Chenshi, 20 years old, from Hangzhou, working as a prostitute in Tianjin. Wu Shaoting, 34 years old, from Yangzhou. Fang Qingshan, 52 years old, from Hebei, previously operated a restaurant in Bengbu, currently unemployed. After the questioning, police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang stood up and stated the case, saying that the defendants were arrested in Tianjin on the 25th of last month for kidnapping and brought to Shanghai on the 5th of this month. The police stated that the defendants had committed many crimes, and the case was complex and had not yet been investigated. They requested that the defendants be detained temporarily and the date be changed to two weeks so that a detailed investigation could be conducted before filing a lawsuit. The defendant Zheng Tangsheng retained lawyer Wang Shizong to defend him. Zheng Chenshi was represented by lawyer Jin Yu, who claimed that Chenshi was suffering from lung disease and requested that she be released on bail or sent to a forensic doctor for treatment during the postponement. The court verified the information and announced that the trial would be postponed to August 21st. The twelve defendants were temporarily detained by the police, and the police were instructed that if any of the defendants were found to be unrelated to the case during the investigation period, they should be sent to the court for disposition at any time. After the announcement, the defendants were taken down by the bailiffs and escorted back to the police station to await investigation.</p>

<p>Sinking Several Pirate Ships Due to the recent unrest in the waters off the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, with pirates rampaging and disturbing travelers, Chiang Kai-shek, the Chairman of Nanchang, received reports from various jurisdictions and ordered Gu Zhutong, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Lu Dipin, the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, to jointly suppress the pirates along with the naval forces. The Jiangsu Province dispatched Zhang Xianyi, the head of the Fourth District of the Water Police, while Zhejiang Province sent Ouyang Ge, the commander of the Second Detachment of the Offshore Water Police, to advance towards the waters outside Wusong Port. They encountered the pirates, and with their joint efforts, the pirates, due to their inferior firepower, retreated towards the Zhejiang coast. Several pirate ships have been sunk, and the pursuit is still ongoing.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Police Officer Bai Linguang Commits Suicide <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>(Due to both family troubles and illness)</p>
<p>His suicide note stated the reasons as follows: Bai Linguang, a police officer from the Sanjing Police Station of the Second Branch of the Third District in Pudong, was on guard at the entrance of the station from 0:00 AM to 3:00 AM yesterday morning. However, around 2:30 AM, in the dead of night, the officer suddenly took off the rifle he was carrying, pointed the muzzle at his lower jaw, pulled the trigger, and shot himself. With a loud bang, the bullet entered from the lower left jaw and exited from the left side of the brain, creating a large hole from the teeth to the temples. He collapsed on the empty ground next to the police station. The police chief, Wang Zhaolin, heard the sound and rushed out of bed to investigate. He saw the officer lying on the ground with his head facing south and feet facing north, moaning and twisting, but not yet dead. He immediately sent officers to take him to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the injury, he died midway and was taken back to the station. The incident was reported to the Second Branch for verification. The director of the branch received the report and immediately sent Inspector Yu Zuyao to the entrance of the station to investigate. It was learned that when the deceased fell to the ground, the rifle was close to his body, and the trigger seemed to have been activated by his right toe. Upon searching the deceased's body, two suicide notes were found. The tone of the notes indicated that he intended to retire and return home due to illness, but he felt ashamed to face people, so he conceived the idea of ending his life. Inspector Yu took the notes back to the station and reported to the director, who instructed the local bailiff, Ma Xichuan, to report to the local court, which sent prosecutor Du Pu to the scene to verify that the officer had indeed committed suicide by shooting himself. The body was handed over to the station to prepare a coffin for burial. It is said that the deceased was 28 years old and a native of Beiping. He was transferred from Beiping after the Shanghai war. He suffered from neurasthenia and was often ill. This sudden suicide was unexpected by others. His suicide notes are recorded below: 1. When I left home, it was because my newlywed wife of less than two years had passed away. After my wife died, my parents and siblings-in-law had disagreements and argued and fought all day long. I got sick in anger for more than two months. When I was about 70% or 80% recovered, I came to Shanghai and have been here for more than a year, not sending a single cent home. Thinking that if I am not sick now, I would have no choice but to apply for a long vacation. But then I thought about the things at home. Going home now would be like becoming a disabled person. How would I have the face to see my parents and neighbors? So yesterday I went to Shanghai to cheer myself up for a day. After returning to the station, I thought about it and developed the idea of ending my life. I wanted to do it half a day ago (the meaning of these numbers is unclear). After walking around for a week with the gun, I thought again about how the police chief treats people like a Buddha, and my colleagues have no enemies or hatred. So I shot myself and died, without any complaints. Handwritten by Bai Linguang. 2. Dear Police Chief, I am truly sorry for you. I am causing you trouble. I will thank you in the next life. Because there is a military uniform paper, please investigate it. August 5th.</p>

<p>) Already sent to the morgue ((Unexpectedly, his life was not destined to end)</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, near the Jiangwan train station, a man, approximately thirty years old, dressed in rags and resembling a beggar, collapsed on the road. A patrol officer from the Fifth Precinct, Fifth Sub-precinct, noticed him and promptly sent him to the Jiangwan Public Security Road Epidemic Hospital for treatment. The hospital doctor examined him, but the man had been silent since entering the hospital, so his name and place of origin remained unknown. Around 5 a.m. yesterday, his condition suddenly worsened, and efforts to save him were ineffective, resulting in his death. The hospital sent the body to the morgue to await preparation for burial, and simultaneously reported to the Fifth Sub-precinct, which instructed the local warden to request a forensic examination from the court. Unexpectedly, at that moment, the man suddenly revived and began breathing normally. The people in the hospital were greatly surprised upon seeing this and hurriedly reported to the Fifth Sub-precinct again. After a doctor's examination, it was confirmed that he had indeed come back to life. For a time, the news spread far and wide, and everyone regarded it as a miracle.</p>
<h3 id="e109">An Ephemeral Affair Like Dew <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Kuixuan, past his prime, still enjoys the company of young women, but their cohabitation lasted less than a year before they ended up in court. Their mutual accusations show that they should have known better. Zheng Kuixuan from Guangdong, residing at No. 4 Tailai Lane, North Shanxi Road, is approaching middle age but still has strong desires. Recently, he had a brief affair with a young woman named Xi Huiying, but then abandoned her. Consequently, the girl's mother, Xi Yin, acting as her legal guardian, hired lawyers Lu Qi and Chen Ying to sue Zheng for seduction in the First Special District Court. She alleged that in August of last year, an old neighbor, Mr. Wang, accompanied the defendant and happened to pass by the plaintiff's house, No. 37 Jufeng Lane, Chengdu Road, Xin Zha Road. Mr. Wang went inside to visit an old friend, and the defendant also went in, which is how he first saw the plaintiff's daughter, Huiying. From then on, the defendant developed a fondness for her and frequently visited under various pretexts. Over time, they became acquainted, and taking advantage of the plaintiff's absence,</p>
<p>(He repeatedly flattered Huiying) and claimed to be a broker at the Miao Bu Exchange, emphasizing his high status and wealth, and expressing his desire to spend his life with Huiying. The young girl, naive and weak-willed, believed his words and was lured to various hotels to satisfy his lust, about three or four times a week. Sometimes, Huiying would not return home at night. Later, the defendant rented a back room at No. 3 Xin Zha Road as a rendezvous point. More recently, he wanted to make Huiying a concubine. They had a falling out, and Huiying, feeling ashamed, attempted suicide by taking poison. Fortunately, she was cured in the hospital and survived. Only then did the plaintiff learn the whole story.</p>
<p>) Hence, she filed the lawsuit (requesting the defendant to be punished according to Article 357, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, etc.). After being sued, Zheng also hired a lawyer to defend himself, claiming that the plaintiff's daughter was not from a good family but was a prostitute. They met at the Yong'an Rooftop Garden, and although they had sex, he had paid her for the night, so the charge of seduction could not stand. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special Court summoned both parties to court for separate inquiries. First, the plaintiff, Xi Yin, testified that her husband's name was Xi Fusheng, and he was currently a supervisor at the Tangshan Railway Factory. She had one son and one daughter. Her son, nicknamed Xinbao, was thirty years old and currently an engineer in Anhui. Her daughter, Huiying, nicknamed Gendi, was only nineteen years old, born at the hour of Hai (9-11 PM) on the first day of the eighth month (lunar calendar), of the year of the Rabbit. She had received some education but was not yet engaged to anyone. Her seduction by Zheng began last August, but she was initially unaware of it until this April when they fell out and her daughter took poison at home. Only then did she learn the cause. The house Zheng rented has not yet been vacated, etc. Next, Huiying testified, first about her family background, and then</p>
<p>(She described the course of their affair in detail) that an old neighbor, Mr. Wang, brought the defendant to her house. At that time, the defendant took notice of her. Later, Wang invited her mother to dinner. Her mother had been gone for a long time, when the defendant suddenly came to her house and insisted on taking her out. When they arrived at the restaurant, her mother was not there. The defendant said her mother had gone to buy something and told her to eat first. She was then tricked into getting drunk with wine and taken to the Great Shanghai Hotel, where she was raped. Afterward, when she returned home, her mother asked her where she had been. She said she had been at a relative's house. From then on, the defendant often picked her up by car for secret meetings, about three or four times a week. On February 14 of this year, the defendant, because of the high cost of hotels, rented a back room at No. 3 Xin Zha Road as</p>
<p>(A temporary meeting place). The defendant said that his wife was dead and that he would marry her as his second wife. He also boasted about his wealth, saying that those who knew him called him the "rich Chaozhou man." But in April, he suddenly became cold towards her and told her to find another way out. At that time, Mr. Wang, who had introduced them, had already died, and there was no one to mediate. They quarreled, and she took poison in the rented room at No. 3. The defendant did not allow her to die there, so she had to return home, and only then did her mother learn of the matter, etc. When questioned, the defendant Zheng Kuixuan testified that one evening in August of last year, he and a friend, Mr. Ding, went to the Yong'an Rooftop Garden, where they met the plaintiff and her daughter. At that time, Xi Yin immediately propositioned him,</p>
<p>(Claiming her daughter's name was Hongfu). That night, he went to a hotel with the daughter, and after a night of pleasure, he gave her ten yuan. Afterward, he always gave her money. The house was rented by the plaintiff. This woman is not only a prostitute but also not the plaintiff's biological daughter. Later, he went to her house and saw the daughter sleeping with another man, so he stopped going there. That man is Xi Xueji, whom the plaintiff claims is her son, but who is actually her brother. He works at Butterfield &amp; Swire and is not in Anhui, etc. He also presented Xi Xueji's handwritten letter as evidence. Judge Feng then ordered the case to be adjourned until Monday for further hearing. For calculating bulk discounts, 40 people can contact the ticket office at the Copper Man Wharf.

<p>The Shanghai Barbers' Association Gao and Zhu Tragedies Committee continued its discussion yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the barbers' association hall on Xieqiao in the Nanshi district regarding the handling of the Gao and Zhu tragedy negotiations. Sixteen committee members were present, forming a quorum. Chen Sijiang was publicly elected as chairman, and the usual formalities were observed. The chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting: 1) Regarding the Gao case negotiation, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, had agreed to give Gao Wen one month to return to his hometown from Shanghai in order to mediate a resolution. Now that the deadline has passed and Gao Wen has returned to Shanghai after completing his business in his hometown, the question is how to proceed with the negotiation. It was decided to first send a letter to inquire whether Mr. Du has returned to Shanghai after his summer vacation. Regarding the Zhu Xuehai case, in which Zhu was crushed to death by a U.S. Marine Corps soldier, the association hired lawyer Yu Xiufang to send a letter to the U.S. Defense Forces Headquarters. The Headquarters replied with a letter, which, while extremely courteous, did not accept responsibility. The question is how the association should respond. It was decided to send another representative to meet with lawyer Yu. 2) The chairman reported on the receipts and expenses, as well as the publication of three issues of the Rong Guang newspaper, hoping that fellow barbers would make efforts to support its continued publication. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 PM after discussing these matters.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Account of the Reception Hosted by the United Securities Investment Company <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The United Securities Investment Company at No. 570 Nanjing Road was founded by giants in Shanghai's financial circles. To facilitate business development and cater to Chinese investors, it established a Chinese Manager's Office at No. A-4 on the first floor at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. Yesterday, it hosted a banquet at the Hongkou Hotel on North Sichuan Road, inviting prominent figures from the press and business circles, both Chinese and Western, to foster relationships. Attendees included Ma Yinliang from the Shen Bao, Wang Zhongwei, Yan Duhe, and Yu Kongwo from the Xinwen Bao, Zhang Zhuping, Pan Gongbi, and Xiong Shaohao from the Shishi Xinbao, Zeng Xubai, Chen Yaozhu, and Wang Jincheng from the Da Wan Bao, Wang Zhongji from the Shibao, Zhu Yitian from the Dalu Bao, and Zhao Jinqing from the business world, totaling over 200 people. The company's directors Zhu Boquan and Shi Boqun, Chinese Manager Yu Huidong, and Chinese Deputy Manager Wang Jia, etc., provided attentive hospitality. Around 7:00 PM, guests were seated, and Mr. Burke, Chairman of the company's board of directors, who is also the manager of the Bao Ke Foreign Firm and a director of the Lianli Film Company, presided over the event. During the banquet, Mr. Zhu Boquan stood up and delivered a speech, the text of which is as follows: "I am very honored to have you all grace us with your presence today, especially in this hot weather. Now, I have something to report to you and would like to ask for your guidance. The United Securities Investment Company is an investment institution serving the public. Its sole business is to promote securities through installment payments, without limiting the type of security, whether domestic or foreign, all are within the scope of our company's business. The first type we are promoting is the national credit bonds issued by France in 1920. Our company believes that these bonds have maintained their creditworthiness since their issuance and offer generous benefits, because in addition to the repayment of principal and interest, there are also substantial bonuses. The advantages are detailed in the purchase regulations printed by our company, so there is no need to repeat them here. In addition to France, lottery bonds have also been issued by Italy, Belgium, and Greece. In the future, our company will continue to introduce them to the public, giving them the opportunity to obtain large bonuses while making sound investments. In the past decade, the public has understood that saving is a good thing, and the financial industry has devised various methods to promote it. The most effective way to encourage saving is through lottery-based methods. However, the current lottery savings schemes inevitably have several drawbacks: 1) The term is too long, usually around ten years, and individuals may experience changes in their economic situation that prevent them from completing the full term; 2) The amount of the bonus is not fixed and often fluctuates depending on the number of savers; 3) The interest rate is too low, and some people who have paid installments for more than ten years only receive their own capital back. Those who win the lottery are naturally well-off, but those who do not win suffer too much. Now, the French national credit bonds sold by our company have the advantage of addressing the three drawbacks mentioned above: 1) Installment payments are only for 28 months, the term is very short, and there is little risk of being unable to continue payments halfway. Each month is only five yuan, averaging just over two jiao per day, which is truly easy to afford. Moreover, you receive a number, and after paying the first installment, you have the hope of winning the first prize; 2) Lottery drawings are held eight times a year, and each time, in addition to the first prize of 1 million French francs, there are 12 second to fifth prizes, all paid according to a fixed amount and never changing; 3) Those who win the lottery naturally get a satisfactory result, and those who do not win also receive an annual interest rate of 5% and can also share in a portion of the company's annual net profit. In short, subscribing to the French national credit bonds sold by our company provides both a savings opportunity and the hope of winning a large bonus, and you also enjoy a portion of the company's net profit. It can be said that it combines the advantages of various savings schemes and avoids the drawbacks of general lottery savings schemes. Today, all of you present are leaders of society, and your words carry great weight. On behalf of the company, I ask you to promote this vigorously, so that society knows that there is such an investment institution that serves the public. On the one hand, it can promote savings, and on the other hand, it can help our company develop its business. Both the public and private sectors will be very grateful to you all." Subsequently, Mr. Tang Zhixuan and Mr. Zhao Jinqing delivered replies. The company also hired a full Western dance troupe to perform various dances to entertain the guests. The event concluded at 10:00 PM. It is reported that the Chinese Manager's Office will officially open for business on the 10th of this month. Purchase regulations have been printed and are available for inquiries from all sectors.</p>

<p>Dai died in a thatched house in Rihuigang, west of Dapuqiao, Xuhui. Dai, the concubine of Lu Jincheng, from Jiangbei, had been in a relationship for a long time. Recently, because Lu had fallen in love with someone else, the family expenses were short, and a storm of jealousy broke out the day before. Dai, in a fit of anger, hanged herself from a pillar late at night and died. Lu Jincheng woke up and saw this and fled without a trace. Yesterday, Gu Xueyuan, the local warden of the Fifth District, reported the incident to the local court for investigation. Prosecutor Yang was commissioned to examine the scene and confirmed that she had died by hanging. He ordered that if there were no family members, the hall should collect the body and wait for Lu Jincheng to be brought to justice.</p>
<p>Wang Xiuying died in extreme anger. Wang Xiuying, a woman from Anhui, was 21 years old. Her husband, Wang Zihai, was in their hometown. She lived at No. 9, Li Jiazhai, Wusong, and worked as a car wiper at the Huafeng Yarn Factory. She went to work at the factory the morning before, and because she mistakenly wore oily clothes, she was criticized by a male worker, Zhang Abao. They argued with each other. The matter was reported to the Western foreman, who reprimanded Xiuying again. Wang Xiuying resigned in extreme anger. The Japanese foreman tried to appease her, but she couldn't suppress her anger. At noon, she hanged herself in the toilet. A worker from the same factory went inside to relieve himself and discovered the body. He reported it to the factory owner, who reported it to the First Section of the Seventh District. Zhang Abao was detained, and the local warden was ordered to report the incident to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Bandit Zhang Er Awaits Further Questioning by Plaintiff <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Er, from Qingkou, is 34 years old and lives at No. 157, Pingliang Road. On the 28th of last month, Wang Shouzhang, a detective from the Doushan County Public Security Bureau, based on the confession of the captured bandit Li Changqing, that between August 22nd of last year, he and</p>
<p>Zhang colluded to kidnap Li Fengming's family of nine in Doushan Township.</p>
<p>It was related to a case where a large ransom was paid for their release. Zhang was responsible for watching the hostages. He came to Shanghai. The Yulin Road Police Station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Zhang and send him to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, requested that Li Changqing be brought to testify, but the defendant completely denied it. It was ordered that Li be brought to court to testify at the next hearing. Zhang Er was returned to custody. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen conducted a continuation of the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Wang Shouzhang, a detective from the Doushan County Public Security Bureau, stated that Li Changqing could not be brought to the case because the case was committed by a large group of bandits and it was not easy to arrest Li. The journey back and forth would be dangerous, and he requested the court's forgiveness. Police lawyer Zhang argued that since the plaintiff in the case and the captured bandit Li Changqing were not present, the association relationship could not be based solely on Li's confession and should be transferred. Judge Xiao asked Detective Wang of the Public Security Bureau whether the plaintiff Li Fengming could come to the case to identify him. Wang Detective agreed to investigate and summon him. Judge Xiao then ordered Zhang Er to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Factory fired workers for no reason again. On the 4th of this month, the British-American Tobacco Factory in Pudong dismissed workers from the old factory's leaf room No. 146</p>
<p>because a staff member named Ren asked about the weight of tobacco stems for a female worker. There was a conflict in language, and they were fired by the factory for no reason. All the workers were agitated and angry and planned to go on strike together. Upon hearing the news, the union immediately sent people into the factory to negotiate. The factory's attitude was tough, and the negotiations were fruitless. In addition to reporting the dismissal to the Social Bureau for the record, the union has scheduled to convene the workers in the room tonight to report the negotiations.</p>

(1) Request that the capitalists be urged to earnestly fulfill the conditions signed by both parties in 1927. (2) Layoffs should not be abused under the pretext of the autumn inventory. Those who have been laid off before the inventory head should be reinstated immediately. (3) When employing workers, stores must use members of the United Benefit Society as the standard. Non-members should not be employed. (4) Request a responsible statement in the newspaper to withdraw the slanderous submissions to various agencies and the lawsuit in the local court.

<p>Editor: I have checked in the Shanghai section of your newspaper on August 7th (Citizens of Yinxiang District Oppose Latrine Bucket Donation). The so-called collecting of latrine bucket donations and extortion failed, driving away the old woman, etc., does not match the facts. The cleaning workers in this district have always been exploited and oppressed by the contractors in the Yinxiang District Cleaning Institute. Their monthly wages are less than 10 yuan. If they pass water, they must pay it to the government, without any money left. Therefore, most households have the practice of giving a small amount of alcohol money to show consideration and allow the workers to work with peace of mind. This alcohol money is given voluntarily by the residents and is not a forced collection of work. Later, this association discovered hooligans who were collecting money, so it prepared receipts and gave them to Ji Fu to give to the customers when receiving the alcohol money as proof and to prevent abuses. Therefore, the hooligans could not do it conveniently and were very resentful. They threatened workers in Tianfeng Lane to obstruct work and gathered an illegal so-called citizens' meeting, which was actually attended by their accomplices. There were fewer than 10 formal citizens. The so-called proposals were also packaged. The situation is like this. I am deeply afraid of confusing rumors. I hereby send this letter, hoping to make corrections. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper, the Shanghai Seventh District Cleaning Industry Union.</p>

<h3 id="e142">From "Construction" to A Renovation <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Ji Zhi</p>
<p>The progress of national construction is certainly attributed to Shanghai as a giant. Just speaking of houses,</p>
<p>From the former ghost weeping camps, desolate ruins rarely visited, now stand magnificent, towering, tall buildings and mansions; from the former narrow, rugged streets, now gradually opened up into flat asphalt roads, while the cramped, noisy shops on both sides are also demolished and renovated into new Western-style buildings. Shanghai's bright and splendid present is due to our gratitude to foreigners for opening up the concession, and to the unremitting efforts of the Chinese people to catch up. Recently, the huge waves of international economic panic spread from the other side of the Pacific to Shanghai's world trade market; at the same time, the collapse of the domestic rural economy also affected this ten-mile foreign market, resulting in an unprecedented commercial downturn, with every family "sacrificing greatly" and "great discounts" every day. Despite the continuous discovery of "opening great auspiciousness," business is enough to lead to wealth, so naturally some people muddle the waters to catch fish, and despite "opening great auspiciousness," they still shout "grand opening congratulations" with no increase. Rich people and landlords in the interior, due to the unstable situation, have also abandoned everything and come to the sea as leisurely absentee landlords, which has resulted in a situation of "more people than houses." Whether it is a shop or a house in a certain neighborhood, it is often reported as "full." In this way, smart entrepreneurs take the opportunity to invest in the construction business, so the east is renovated and the west is renovated, demolishing some of the older shops and houses and rebuilding them to suit the principle of "prosperous market." My friend Mr. S, seeing that Yangjingbang has been filled to become the current Avenue Edward VII, can of course be called "Old Shanghai." However, he left here last autumn and returned this summer. He no longer recognizes the Old West Gate, which shows Shanghai's rapid change.</p>
<p>However, the more houses that are renovated, the worse it is for poor friends, because they have no blessings to live in foreign houses for a lifetime. They watch the rich move in and are squeezed out of the urban living circle. Therefore, whether the progress of material civilization should be praised or cursed is really a difficult decision!</p>
<h3 id="e143">New Record <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Ling</p>
<p>At this North China Games, men's and women's track and field and swimming set many new records, which of course makes me</p>
<p>We are comforted a lot. However, apart from the Games, many new records have been set, which of course also deserve our attention.</p>
<p>Driven by love, people try their best to achieve their goals, even sacrificing their lives if necessary. This is already a bad habit of young people, but at most, rivals in love hate each other and kill one person. But recently, in Smyrna, Turkey, because of competition for a beautiful woman, 35 people were openly injured. It is really unheard of, a new record. Being an emperor, of course, means ruling over all people and no longer being subject to any jurisdiction. Although Emperor Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty was ruled by the Empress Dowager, he was still subject to human jurisdiction. Recently, Puyi in the Northeast has become a puppet, and Araki even uses a supreme military dog to supervise him, a new record.</p>
<p>Our country has always been known as a land of etiquette and righteousness, and the word "integrity" is especially emphasized, so nude sports have been unanimously decided to oppose. However, the more modern the girls who walk on the road, up to four-tenths of them are naked in their calves or thighs, plus a tight-fitting, thin gauze cheongsam. Ah! Models can be seen on the road, a new record.</p>
<p>The soldiers of our noble country have always paid attention to the civil war. Now, it is reported that the Sichuan front line is more than 1,000 miles long. And the superiors of our noble country do not care about the suffering of the people. It is said that the Sichuan land tax has been collected until the 56th or 60th year of the Republic of China. A new record.</p>
<p>New records are only produced when things progress. Now that they are emerging in an endless stream, it may not be a good phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Results <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Hongxia</p>
<p>Vertically, from ancient times to today, horizontally, from the South Pole to the North Pole, from the easternmost to the westernmost points, no matter how big or small the matter, there will always be "results."</p>
<p>Naturally, if a "cause" is sown, there must be a "fruit." Murder is the "cause," execution is the "result." Studying, becoming an official, becoming rich as an official, becoming wealthy, taking a concubine... these are all matters of mutual "cause" and "effect."</p>
<p>People say, "Nothing in the world cannot be done." "Done" means "result," "undone" means "no result." Therefore, there is absolutely nothing in the world that has "no result."</p>
<p>However, there is an exception outside the realm of theorems: China. In China, there are very few "fruits," and many tricks end with "no result" and then dissipate.</p>
<p>General assembly resolutions, three-year plans, five-year plans... these will not have "results." In short... Chinese people only have "causes" and will not have "results." Alas! China has very few "results," so in the future, it will inevitably reap a big "fruit."</p>
<h3 id="e145">Nanjing Road in Summer <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>At the end of spring this year, I don't know which astronomer, based on his observations, said, "There will be no summer this year." He even revealed it in the newspapers. At that time, two groups of people with different feelings of sorrow and joy expressed their opinions. Those with a pessimistic outlook were, of course, the general peddlers who relied on ice cream, plum juice, Dubinet soda, etc., and the big bosses of cold drink shops. They thought, "It must be fate. If the weather is not hot this year, how will we make up for the reduced income?" Those with an optimistic outlook were, of course, those who feared the heat like tigers. They thought, "It's a blessing from heaven that there's no summer this year. Not only can we greatly reduce summer spending, but we can also sweat less!" Who knew that facts are facts, and nothing can be forced. What is the current climate like? It is said that "for several days, it has been above 100 degrees." From this, it seems that the astronomer made the same mistake as Mr. Chan and Mr. Jia in misreading the next year's calendar. How laughable! The pavement of Nanjing Road is wider than other roads, so it can withstand more heat. The asphalt pavement, after being baked by the fierce sunlight, melts into a glue-like substance. Although the Public Works Department sprinkles fine sand on it, the rickshaw pullers who "earn their own living" still struggle desperately, running quickly. One day, I saw a rickshaw puller collapse on the road: many people watched, but no one could do anything!</p>
<p>Watering motorcars often shuttle back and forth on Nanjing Road. Although the main road surface temporarily receives some moisture, the friends in the shops along the roadside often smell a foul smell of water vapor. I don't know if this watering is hygienic or unsanitary. The followers of the Situ Temple (i.e., the Rainbow Temple) still fearlessly worship and prostrate themselves in the heat, lighting candles and burning incense. General incense candle shops still sell them in pairs of candles and one by one of incense to people.</p>
<p>"Summer Sales," "Special Sales," "Selling at Cost," "Bargain Sales," etc., of different banners, many can be seen on Nanjing Road. The buyers of the big companies, men and women, are still many. They don't seem to be afraid of the heat, and they still carry heavy things they bought in their hands.</p>
<p>The upscale cold drink shops, besides those opened by foreigners, also include many owned by Chinese. It is said that "their business exceeds previous years." The astronomer is a liar, actually "backfiring," so the big bosses laugh heartily. However, those who fear the heat suffer and complain to the heavens.</p>
<p>It is said that "foreigners are promoting their goods on a large scale in Shanghai."</p>
<p>"Those buyers, besides the Chinese living in Shanghai, I think there are no people of other nationalities." Just looking at the general peddlers on Nanjing Road,</p>

<p>Chapter 13: Abandoning Duty to Meet a Soulmate, a Beautiful Woman Silently Agrees; Inheriting the Family Business, a Strong Man Rejoices Wildly. After Zhao Ziqiang had that experience, he discovered that military life was, after all, tiresome. Moreover, after carefully calculating, it was extremely uneconomical. So, he went to the company headquarters, found Sergeant Wang Shili, and discussed this matter. Wang Shili was suddenly surprised to hear that the company commander wanted to resign. He looked at his face for a long time, unable to say a word. Zhao Ziqiang said seriously: It's true, I'm not going to do it anymore. It's not easy for a soldier to get out if he doesn't want to do it, but I'm a company commander who doesn't want to do it. There are plenty of people who want this position, so why would I be afraid of not being able to leave? Wang Shili said: Isn't that the end of it? There are many people who want to be company commander, so why throw away the existing company commander and not do it? You should discuss it privately with your close friends. Let's say a word in private: climbing from a soldier to a company commander takes a lot of effort. If you don't do it, the years of suffering you endured before will be somewhat inexplicable. If you knew that climbing to company commander was meaningless, you shouldn't have picked up a gun in the first place. These few words left Zhao Ziqiang unable to respond. After a long pause, he said: Coming to pick up a gun before was what I thought before. Not wanting to pick up a gun now is what I think now. Wang Shili was, after all, a person of lower status. Hearing him say this, he didn't dare to ask further, so he could only smile at him insincerely. When Zhao Ziqiang walked from his home to Yuanlai, he was thinking about his own reasons. He only thought that the money earned from the position of company commander was too insignificant, and it was not as good as picking buckets and selling vegetables, where he could still enjoy family happiness. What are people living for? Just to get up when the bugle sounds and eat when the bugle sounds? The more he thought about it, the more reasonable he felt, and there was not a single opposing thought to stop him. At this time, although Wang Shili said a few words lightly, but thinking carefully, his words also had reason. It is really not easy for a gun-carrying person to climb to be a company commander. Now that he resigns, wouldn't all previous efforts be in vain? (152)</p>

<h3 id="e147">About the Chicago World's Fair <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The Chicago World's Fair, originally scheduled to open on June 1st, actually opened ahead of schedule on May 27th. After opening, because the scale of this World's Fair is so grand, it has created an unprecedented record. All the exhibits are sufficient to represent the progress of industry and commerce in the last hundred years. Therefore, everything is worthy of our attention. For this reason, I will report some trivial news:</p>
<p>The architecture of the Chicago World's Fair, because the scale is so grand, the architecture of the Chicago World's Fair is, of course, astonishing. The construction methods of all the exhibition halls are based on science. When the construction began, the planned construction cost was a total of US$11,000,000. However, the result exceeded this budget, and in addition to the construction undertaken by the General Assembly, some of the pavilions of various countries were built by themselves. The construction cost was at least 2,000,000 US$. In addition to the buildings, there are also public gardens and sports grounds. Architects from all over the world were gathered in one place to plan this Chicago World's Fair. The magnificence of the architecture can naturally represent an era in the history of architecture!</p>
<p>The security scale of the Chicago World's Fair is so grand. The value of the exhibits in the venue is inevitably incalculable, but we have already known from past experience that pickpockets and petty thieves are the most numerous at the World's Fair, so the loss of exhibits has also been heard from time to time. For this reason, this time at the Chicago World's Fair, great attention was paid to security. A lot of experienced and trained police officers and plainclothes detectives were recruited in advance to patrol back and forth and guard the various rooms. Some of the detectives had served in last year's Los Angeles Olympic World Games, so naturally they had outstanding detective skills and experience. In front of a famous French painting, there was even a special detective on duty to prevent theft.</p>
<p>Speaking of the detectives at the Chicago World's Fair, we must think of the thieves at the Chicago World's Fair. In general, the thieves in the United States, after hearing that the Chicago World's Fair was open, felt that this was an opportunity not to be missed, and they all came to Chicago to prepare to do a good business. Who knew that once they arrived in Chicago and entered the Chicago World's Fair, they found that the defense was so strict that the sharp eyes of the general detectives shot at them, and they were already frightened. Not to mention that there was no opportunity to steal the exhibits, they didn't even dare to pickpocket or dig pockets among the crowds of visitors, for fear of being arrested!</p>
<p>Transportation to the Chicago World's Fair Chicago was originally the center of American industry and commerce, so the railway is like a spider web. The important railways all take Chicago as the central station, so the transportation is also very convenient. During the opening period of the Chicago World's Fair, all the guests who came to visit could travel directly back and forth without any obstacles. However, the officials of the General Assembly, in order to facilitate the travel of visitors, also prepared a lot of public buses to drive directly to various places. In this way, the people of the United States, whether they live in the countryside or in the city, will find it very convenient.</p>
<p>The exhibits at the Chicago World's Fair This time, all countries exhibited their most beautiful products at the Chicago World's Fair and transported them for industrial and commercial competition. Among them, the United States' exhibits included the most cars and airplanes. The new cars and new airplanes from various factories were all displayed in one place, which was praised by the guests. As for China, it is the most pitiful, right? Because of the Sino-Japanese dispute, the government originally planned not to participate, but the people automatically transported the exhibits for display. There were very few industrial products among the exhibits, and the only thing that the Americans praised was China's silk weaving and embroidery. It is said that a Hunan embroidery was embroidered with a portrait of the American President Roosevelt. When the General Assembly closes, it will be presented to the American President Roosevelt. It is really pitiful to say that the rest of the exhibits cannot compete with the beauty of other countries!</p>

<h3 id="e148">Special Feature on National Defense Education (2) <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Professor Zhang Qiyun of Central University Lectures on Zi Tao's Notes: True national defense is not dead national defense, but living national defense. It does not teach people to die, but teaches people to live, that is, to achieve the least amount of danger and the greatest amount of comfort. Without the support of the entire nation, without the vision to use the strength of the entire nation to engage in war, only caring about teaching soldiers to go to the front line to fight and risk their lives, making them exposed to the yellow sand and making meaningless sacrifices, this is the most cruel and unkind thing in the world. National defense does not contain any mysterious meaning. As long as the people of the whole country do their best and work together towards the goal of national construction, they can achieve political integrity, everything is revitalized, and foreigners will have awe in their hearts invisibly, often making the enemy dare not even think of invading the Central Plains. This is the best policy for national defense. If we must wait for the enemy to attack before we start to resist, then it is impossible to prevent. If military fortresses are built in battlefield positions or border fronts for defense, it is still a medium policy for national defense. Looking at the natural hazards known as the first pass in the world, there is no artillery position and no military engineering with deep ditches and solid barriers. Isn't this the biggest joke?</p>
<p>Sun Tzu said, "If the defender is insufficient, the attacker has more than enough." The two words of national defense must not be interpreted incorrectly. What I hate to hear most is the recently popular term called "defensive national defense." How can there be reason to defend without being able to attack? After a place is lost, don't you want to counterattack? The reason why defensive national defense is inferior is that everything is passive rather than active, and everything is transferred according to the enemy's actions, like a shadow following a shape, and a yin pattern following a yang pattern, which is really a suffering to run for life. Taking the law from the middle can only get the lower. This is an inevitable trend. National defense, national defense, is not only for defense. Its defense is only for the preparation of opposition. Its opposition has the strongest power. Its power is enough to defeat the army of imperialists. Therefore, the ultimate goal of national defense is to win. How far is a passive strategy from non-resistance?</p>
<p>National defense has two aspects: intangible and tangible. The former is spirit, and the latter is material, but material comes with spirit, not spirit with material.</p>
<p>The year before last, Mr. Du Xigui went to Japan to investigate the navy and visited Marshal Togo Heihachiro of Japan at his private residence. He was a heavy and taciturn person. He said to Mr. Du, "If you come to our country to investigate the navy, you should pay attention to the spirit of the navy. Other things are not important." In addition to what he said, all were ceremonial words. Only to General Sa, the predecessor of our country's navy, did he inquire about his well-being. Mr. Du said, "Although I have repeatedly talked about the navy, the host seems unwilling to speak, and I am not convenient to ask again." With Togo's lofty position, his residence is no different from ordinary people, and his utensils are extremely simple, which is enough to be an example for our generation. He didn't want to say much about the navy. I don't know what his intentions were, but from his few words, I feel that a little is better than a lot.</p>
<p>I believe that the above four points are what the comrades who are currently advocating national defense education should pay attention to first and often observe.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Second Lecture on National Defense Education from an Educational Point of View <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Everyone is a practical educator. There is no need for me to show off my knowledge of the general principles of education. For the sake of focusing attention, I still have to put forward a few points for discussion, and please give your advice.</p>
<h3 id="e150">㈠ National Accounting Theory in Education <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Our knowledge theory is a tool to cope with the environment and overcome difficulties. The greatest difficulty is the difficulty of the country, that is, the so-called national crisis. Since China's education is a tool to transform China's environment and solve China's major problems, the education policy should focus on the entire national defense plan, and be a plan to prescribe the right medicine. The correctness and reliability of all teaching materials and methods also depend on whether they can have this function. If they can, they are real; if they cannot, they are false. Therefore, advocating national defense education should take the two words "function" as a prerequisite everywhere. For example, the function of submarines depends on the size of the country's naval power, and each has its own opinion. The United Kingdom has repeatedly advocated abolishing submarines, while France has fiercely opposed it. At the Washington Conference, the remarks made by the French plenipotentiary Mr. Briand were very interesting. When the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan were arguing over the ratio of capital ships at 70% and 60%, Mr. Briand said, "France now does not discuss capital ships at all, but only wants submarines and cruisers." When the United Kingdom attacked France, he said to reporters, "The United Kingdom has Japan as an ally and is also friendly with the United States, but its capital ships have 500,000 tons of great navy. It is said that it is completely dealing with France, which it dare not do, or will it be used for large-scale deep-sea fishing? Therefore, France proposes to build a large number of submarines and will also engage in the study of underwater plants." What a pleasant and funny remark! When Mr. Du Xigui was investigating the navies of the major powers, Germany strongly urged China to build submarines, and Japan strongly argued that they were worthless. This is what Sima Zhao's heart is, and everyone knows it. Recently, the cry for aviation to save the country has been sung to the clouds, but the importance of submarines has not yet attracted attention. I remember that elementary school students in Hangzhou once raised money to build warships for the navy, but the education authorities said that it would be better to donate money for airplanes, which is quite disappointing. The function of submarines can make countries with weak naval strength not completely in a passive and defensive position, but can also engage in offensive actions. Submarines can not only be used within territorial waters, but also outside territorial waters. During the European War, German submarines once went to the coast of the United States and back, without having to replenish fuel. In naval warfare, submarines themselves do not have the power to determine the outcome, but they can also contain a part of the enemy's strength, so that the enemy's spirit is always at risk of being attacked. Moreover, the cost of building submarines is relatively low. The cost of building a battleship can at least build twenty or thirty medium-sized submarines. Therefore, most small and weak countries are working hard to equip themselves with submarines. According to our country's current national conditions, instead of expecting capital ships that cannot be obtained quickly, why not complete the construction of submarines first to meet the urgent needs of national defense? Mr. Huang Lizhou once said, "The way of learning is to be truly educated by what you can use yourself." The new theory of education also advocates "The way of education is to be truly educated by what can be used in your own country." The future of Chinese education must be adapted to national defense on the one hand, which is practical, not empty, and must be progressed in national crisis on the other hand, which is active, not static. Let us call it national accounting theory.</p>
<p>㈡ Theory of People's Livelihood in Education Education is life, and the school itself is a kind of life organization. The studies in the school must be quickly integrated with the life outside the school, so that every student can become a productive citizen. This is called the theory of people's livelihood in education. We do not advocate vocationalism. We believe that complete general education is far more valuable than narrow vocational training. Learning is to learn to be human. What is vocational education is nothing more than the knowledge and ability developed by general training, so that it can be active in a special position. However, in addition to work and occupation, there are other studies, especially the pure and supreme patriotism. Today, the strength of a country is not only based on the navy and army, but also on the national spirit of the country, that is, the so-called independent and unyielding spirit. We do not emphasize humanism either. We believe that the old-fashioned ideas, such as "laboring the mind" and "laboring the body," "governing people" and "being governed," should all be broken. Modern education is the education of the common people, which values both learning and thinking deeply and respects action and labor, adopting the principle of learning and doing at the same time, so that both production and training have a high speed. The above is an abstract theory. We can cite actual achievements to</p>
<p>prove it. During the Russo-Japanese War, the situation of Japanese agriculture greatly demonstrated its elasticity. The war had many effects on agricultural elements, such as hundreds of thousands of strong men throwing away their hoes and holding guns, and tens of thousands of horses leaving the fields and serving in the military. Even cattle were slaughtered for food. Agricultural labor was reduced so much by the war, and the increased burden on farmers due to the increased taxes and the raising of war debts was also very heavy, thus greatly reducing agricultural capital. However, Japanese farmers showed their sincere patriotism in this extraordinary period, economizing on food and clothing to make up for the lack of agricultural capital. Old, young, men, and women all worked together to make up for the lack of agricultural labor. Although the country had major events, the people were calm and heavy, and from the outside, they seemed unaware that there was a major war. For example, agricultural improvement, which was not easy to implement even with the most sincere encouragement in peacetime, was widely implemented during the war, and its results were also very significant. As a result, Japanese agricultural production presented an unprecedented harvest, such as the rice harvest being more than one-fifth higher than the average year, and wheat and silk also being superior to the average year's production. Japanese farmers are resilient and can work hard. The war lasted for two years, and they contributed brave soldiers, fine military horses, and abundant food to the country, and there was still more than enough. Undoubtedly, this is the effect of education in the twenty-odd years since the Meiji Restoration in Japan.</p>
<p>㈢ Theory of Age Order in Education</p>
<p>Education must be suitable for the students' level and psychological state. Mr. Graham Wallas, an Englishman who has studied political psychology, once said that "What is most likely to move children's emotions is not words, but scenery (Sight) and sound (Sonud). If you want children to love their country, you must lead them to see the scenery in their country or take them and put them in front of their eyes, such as great buildings, such as solemn ceremonies, which can deeply impress children's hearts and cannot be forgotten." Elementary school students' knowledge is just beginning to sprout, so they should first encourage their interest. Elementary school national defense teaching materials should focus on interesting stories and colorful models. The organization of the teaching materials only needs to be well thought out, and there is no need to solemnly announce it, because orderliness and system are not what children like. Junior high school students have gradually established a sense of order, and the general situation at home and abroad is gradually becoming clear. National defense teaching materials can be from simple to complex and from near to far, but in-depth theories are not yet the time. High school students can implement group methods according to different natures. Assuming that they are divided into three groups, namely the science group, the literature group, and the current affairs group, the national defense teaching materials must be selected separately and compromised to the most appropriate extent. Universities have more detailed majors, and the principle of teaching students according to their aptitude is more obvious. National defense education has direct and indirect relations with each department and field. Students can engage in in-depth research according to their interests and abilities. Generally, middle school students teach more than they learn, university students teach and learn equally, and in graduate school, there is no such thing as teaching, only focusing on research. Modern warfare is not only a war of soldiers, but also a war of science, or a martial arts competition of technology born from science. The weapons of war are not in the gunships and airplanes themselves, but in the industry that creates gunships and airplanes, or not in the industry of a country, but in the scientific research that creates the industry. Mr. Yan Jidao said, "If the people have a degree, then the ashes will be burned, and there will still be a day. Ignorant people will only harm things if they promote and encourage them."</p>
<p>㈣ Theory of Environment in Education</p>
<p>Education must not only teach according to the time and the students, but also teach according to the place. The operation of modern schools expresses its special color according to the local conditions, that is, the so-called local customs. For example, the education in Shanghai should pay more attention to maritime development and cultivate students' maritime thoughts and maritime spirit. If students cannot have a broad vision, this is an education that is out of touch with the times. There is a term in Europe that has not been seen in Chinese history, that is, maritime power, also known as sea power. In Japan during the Meiji period, all industries made great progress, and the most obvious was the shipping industry and the shipbuilding industry. The shipbuilding industry is a comprehensive industry. Almost all kinds of machinery industries in Japan are related to ships. The machinery industry of the shipyard not only contributes to the navy, but also to the air force and the army. The shipbuilding industry is developed, and the shipping industry is naturally developed, and maritime transport is the foundation of the navy. The rise and fall of maritime transport is the rise and fall of the country. When Japan has a national crisis, tens of thousands of seafarers can be quickly organized to meet the urgent needs. It can be seen that the success of the Japanese navy is not accidental. The 20th century is the era of the Pacific, a statement made by former US President Roosevelt. Roosevelt was the person who established the US naval policy and spared no effort to promote the navy throughout his life. In 1922, the government officially designated his birthday (October 27) as Navy Day. Recently, due to the dangerous situation in the Far East, Americans have paid more attention to this festival. Although China does not have a Navy Day, I hope that the education community in Shanghai will pay special attention to sea power and advocate for the coastal provinces. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau can find ways to contact the shipping industry to employ a few ships to train the shipping industry, which is specially used for students who are interested in maritime careers to learn navigation. Everything that should be known about maritime transport should be available, and the situation should be used to guide them, promote maritime interests, and cultivate navigation ideas as the prelude to the revitalization of the Chinese navy, because observation of everything in the world must precede the facts. There has never been a fact that can occur without an idea, which is also the meaning of what the Premier said that knowledge is difficult and action is easy.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Zhejiang Province Public and Private High School Graduates Exempted from Entrance Exams to Zhejiang University <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>In the past, during the University District era in Zhejiang Province, graduates of the Provincial Hangzhou High School with excellent grades were already entitled to exemption from entrance exams and guaranteed admission. Later, this was expanded to the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth High Schools, as well as graduates of various provincial high schools. This year marks the first time that high school graduation qualification exams are being conducted. After consultation between the Department of Education and Zhejiang University, to encourage students with excellent results in the provincial high school qualification exams to further their studies, the previous method of guaranteeing admission without exams is temporarily revised. The number of guaranteed admissions for graduates of public and approved private senior high school general studies programs is expanded to fifteen. The qualification exam results will serve as the standard, with a score of 75 or higher and conduct grade B or higher at the original school considered qualified. As for the distribution of places, due to the larger number of graduates from provincial high schools, they are allowed six guaranteed admissions. The Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth High Schools will each continue to have two guaranteed admissions. The remaining three places will be awarded based on the individual performance of graduates from nine private high schools in the qualification exam who wish to attend Zhejiang University, selecting the best in order of merit, limited to a maximum of three. The Department of Education has issued a notice to all schools to submit their nominations before the 10th of this month, and to determine the departments to ensure compliance with the rule of no more than two students per department.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Educational Film Association Asks University Federation to Help Screen Educational Films <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>University students pay one yuan per semester and can watch a movie once every two weeks. The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association has already reported its plan to screen educational films in various schools next semester. The association sent a letter to the University Federation yesterday, requesting strong support when implementing the screening of educational films in various universities. The original letter is excerpted below: It is opened directly. In recent years, China's film industry has become increasingly developed. It is now imperative to use films to assist education and to follow the example of Europe and the United States. Last year, this association was initiated and organized by Mr. Wu Zhihui, Chu Minyi, Chen Lifu, Duan Xipeng, Guo Youshou, and others, and designated by the Ministry of Education as the representative organization for Chinese educational films, cooperating with international organizations. In order to implement film education as soon as possible, educational films are being collected from the International Educational Film Association of the League of Nations and various film companies at home and abroad, and this branch is entrusted to screen them in Shanghai first, taking Shanghai as an advanced city as a model for the whole country. Upon receiving the commission, this branch was established in accordance with the law and the implementation plan was formulated. Every two weeks, screenings will be held in schools at all levels. Each program will include not only interesting educational films, but also two or three reels of high-quality sound films or humorous newsreels, so as to make the audience more interested. All sound projectors and equipment will be provided by this branch. Schools without a large auditorium suitable for screening will rent a suitable venue for screening by this branch and invite students from nearby schools to visit. This method has long been effective in Europe and the United States. Young people's love of movies has become a universal phenomenon in modern times. Educational films are of great interest, and using them to cater to their preferences can naturally achieve the effect of imperceptible influence. However, this branch's expenses are limited, and the cost of going to various schools is very high, so it is necessary to slightly collect funds to supplement the expenses. The joint meeting of the first executive and supervisory committees decided to charge each student in colleges and universities one yuan per semester for educational film fees, which is recorded in the minutes. It is believed that the cost is minimal, but the benefits are substantial, and students from various schools should be willing to assist this great cause to benefit the country and society. However, educational film undertakings are still new in our country, and it is inevitable that some people will wait and see. It is hoped that your association, as the leading organization for university students, will sympathize and provide strong support. All schools will surely respond to the news. It is therefore earnestly requested that you send a letter to the authorities of various schools to strongly support this initiative, and notify the student unions of all schools to unanimously assist in order to facilitate the progress and achieve practical results. Sincerely,</p>

<p>Weida Primary School on Route Lafayette. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, noted that the population of the French Concession in this city has increased sharply in recent years, and students generally find it difficult to attend school. Although there is the Municipal Bide Primary School, due to the limited school building, it is impossible to increase the number of students. Therefore, he specially sought another Western-style house at No. 4 Weida Lane, across from the French Park on Route Lafayette, and borrowed several acres of open space from the Jingjiang Guild Hall next to the house to serve as a sports field. Zhang Shuting was appointed as the principal of the school. It is said that preparations have been completed and it has been decided to enroll 200 students. It is verified that Mr. Zhang graduated from the Jiangsu Second Normal School and has served as a teacher in municipal primary schools for many years. He has very rich experience and will surely achieve good results in the future.</p>

<p>The Board of Trustees for the Management of the British Boxer Indemnity Fund is selecting students to study in the UK at public expense. Regarding academic fields such as shipbuilding, our country does not yet have specialized schools. Inquiries have been repeatedly received regarding how to stipulate the qualifications for candidates. The person in charge of the Board has now explained as follows: Shipbuilding (those who have studied mechanics may also apply), Aeronautical Engineering (those who have studied physics or mechanics may also apply), Geography (those who have studied history or geology may also apply), Geodesy (those who have studied astronomy, mathematics, physics, or civil engineering may also apply). Also, regarding specialized examinations, since our country's schools do not pay much attention to second foreign languages, the Board has been lenient in view of this. Candidates may choose one from the following subjects: Western History (French or German may be changed to Economics), Law (French or German may be changed to Constitution), Politics (French or German may be changed to International Public Law), Biology (French or German may be changed to Plant Geography), Shipbuilding (Ship Design may be changed to Mechanical Design). It is also heard that in order to facilitate candidates who are far away,</p>

<p>Netherlands, Italy, Austria, and Germany have the advantage</p>
<p>Since the International Tennis Federation decided on the new game</p>
<p>After the competition system, it has been implemented this year. Although France once proposed to cancel it, it still failed to pass with a vote of six to seven. According to the content of the new system, the four countries that have the right to the European Zone semi-finals this year and the countries that have the right to the re-election of the countries that win the re-election competition in other countries can participate in the competition next year. The re-election competition will start this year. Therefore, those who do not participate in the competition this year must wait until next year to participate. The Davis Cup competition next year has actually started this year. The order of the re-election competition this year is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Belgium, Hungary, Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands. 1. Romania, Poland, Poland, Italy, Italy, Monaco, Switzerland. 2. Norway, Yugoslavia, Austria, Spain, Austria. 3. Denmark, Greece, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, Germany. 4. Each week's date. The first week, Belgium vs. Hungary, ended on July 23. The second week is scheduled to end before August 20. The third week ends on September 3. There are still four groups that have not competed in the second week.</p>
<p>The competition situation. Among the four groups, the Netherlands has a good chance of winning in the first group, Italy has no problem in the second group, Austria in the third group, and Germany in the fourth group. The overall situation is like this. The countries that have the right to the semi-finals this year are England, Australia, Japan, and the Czech Republic. These eight countries will compete next year. England won the Davis Cup this year and will be replaced by France. There are not many participating countries in the Americas, so this system has not been implemented.</p>

<p>(New York, 5th Reuters) In the Wightman Cup, the international women's lawn tennis competition between England and the United States, the United States team again defeated the English team with a score of four to three, retaining the championship for the seventh consecutive year. The Wightman Cup has been held for eleven years so far.</p>
<p>England's defeat was entirely due to the poor performance on the first day, losing three matches in a row. Therefore, it was difficult to recover on the second day. On the second day, the second singles match was won by Mrs. Jacobs (U.S.A.) against Mrs. Scriven (England), already sealing the championship. The results of the second day are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mrs. Knottenbelt (England) 1-6, 6-1, 6-3 beat Mrs. Babcock (U.S.A.). (2) Mrs. Jacobs (U.S.A.) 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 beat Mrs. Scriven (England).

<h3 id="e178">The Discount on Grandiose Words <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Suo</p>
<p>The discount on grandiose words is, in fact, a discount on literature. An author's self-description often needs to be discounted. Even admitting to being pitiful and useless is not a "fixed price," let alone grandiose words.</p>
<p>The talented Li Bai's fondness for grandiose language goes without saying. Even the gaunt and skeletal literary genius Li Changji, who grew long fingernails, said, "I'll buy a sword from the Ruoye Creek, and tomorrow I'll return to serve Lord Yuan," which was utterly unrealistic; he wanted to be an assassin. This should be discounted to zero. The proof is that he never actually did it. During the difficult times of the Southern Song Dynasty, Lu You was naturally one of the passionate patriots. He once said, "I am still capable of crossing the vast desert; why do you all weep at the New Pavilion?" He was actually unable to go and this should also be discounted to zero. However, I don't have the book at hand, and there might be errors in the quoted poem, so I'll preemptively apply a discount here.</p>
<p>In fact, this habit of feigning grandiose words is not unique to men of letters. Common people or merchants also engage in it frequently. When individuals A and B fight in the market, the loser usually says, "I recognize you!" This means that they will be like Wu Zixu, vowing revenge. However, most of the time, they never actually do it. If they are intellectuals, they might resort to some conspiracy. But for common people, this is often the end of the struggle. The words are spoken without sincerity, and the listeners don't take them seriously. Over time, it has become a kind of ritual to end a fight.</p>
<p>Old novelists have long seen through this situation. When writing about prostitutes arguing with each other, they typically attack the other person for having an affair and then declare, "I am someone who can stand on my fingertips and have people stand on them, someone on whose arms horses can run..." What happens next? They let others apply their own discount. They know that others will never be so foolish as to believe them completely, but they still have to say it, just like quack doctors who print "Intending to deceive the world, struck by thunder and burned" on their packaging - it becomes a kind of ritual.</p>
<p>But due to different circumstances, some people immediately apply their own discounts. For example, in advertisements, we sometimes see people claiming, "I am someone who sits without changing my name and walks without changing my surname." This genuinely evokes a sense of respect, as if one were encountering a character from "The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants." But then it continues with, "Even if I sometimes use other pen names, I am responsible for all the articles I publish." Then they twist their body and disappear like Tu Xingsun. Do I like to "use other pen names"? I have no choice. Shanghai is originally a part of China and naturally receives Confucius's teachings. Even merchants have "fixed price" signs inside their shops that constantly reflect the "big sale" banners outside, but they always have a green reason: either promoting national goods or commemorating the opening.</p>
<p>Therefore, self-discounting is still not enough. Any "old Shanghai" resident must apply another discount.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Conjecture <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Today's students generally think about career paths before even applying to schools, often anxiously looking at a large newspaper full of enrollment advertisements. Liberal arts are absolutely out of the question. Hasn't the Ministry of Education already been restricting the enrollment of liberal arts students? If China's industry could develop, then it would be best to enter engineering, but that "development" is not necessarily guaranteed. Should one enter law school to become a judge or a lawyer? Should one enter business school to become a banker? Studying radio or aviation is the most fashionable, or perhaps one should enter a foreign language school and then work for foreigners in the future. Otherwise, one could become a translator. To be quick, study Japanese...</p>
<p>For female students, sericulture, kindergarten teaching, and obstetrics were previously reliable options, but now they are all somewhat unreliable. Recently, several provinces are planning to establish female police forces. Therefore, "becoming a police officer" has become a new and stable path in their minds.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking was called "conjecture" by Wang Chong of the Han Dynasty, which is similar to what is now called "speculation." However, it has even less certainty than commercial speculation.</p>
<p>Wang Chong's "Lunheng" records a failed "conjecturer," "weeping on the road, lamenting his old age and lost opportunities." When asked why he couldn't succeed, he said:</p>
<p>"When I was young, I studied literature. When my literary talents were accomplished, I wanted to become an official, but the ruler liked to use old men. When the old ruler died, the next ruler used military men. I changed to the military. When my military skills were accomplished, the military ruler also died. When the young ruler came to power, he liked to use young men, and I was already old. That is why I have never had an opportunity!"</p>
<p>The world is too complex, and changes happen too quickly. The certainty of successful "conjecture" has truly become "a sliver." Therefore, the result can only be random "chance," like using ten copper coins to try for a lottery prize of five hundred thousand.</p>
<p>However, I have "conjectured" a path that is foolproof, and now I am willing to offer it to confused young people. This path is: learn to fight.</p>
<p>China's civil wars will probably last for many years, requiring soldiers. External wars will eventually happen, requiring national heroes. If a revolution comes, it will need soldiers. If all else fails, and one needs to "go to Liangshan," one must be a hero. Someone who knows how to fight has many career paths.</p>
<p>In rural temples, recruitment banners are displayed year-round. Military academies, central military and political schools, etc., also recruit students every year. There are many career paths.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Talking About "The Ballad of Zhaojun" <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>I once read a poem by Wang Jian of the Tang Dynasty, "Watching a Southern Barbarian Prostitute," which said, "Wanting to tell the story of Zhaojun, she gathers her emerald eyebrows, her clear voice winding and lamenting in song. Which young man in the spring breeze throws her gold coins and asks her to sing more?" This barbarian prostitute made a living by singing and telling the story of Zhaojun. It is unknown what form her performance took - Suzhou ballads? Drum ballads? Or flower drum folk songs? Furthermore, the Complete Tang Poems contains a poem by Ji Shilao, a poet whose lineage and official rank are untraceable, entitled "Watching a Shu Woman Perform The Ballad of Zhaojun," which says, "The enchanting woman has not yet donned her pomegranate skirt, but claims her family is connected to the Jinshui River. Her coral lips know the events of a thousand years, and her clear words are worthy of lament in the autumn wind. The crescent moon on the border is reflected in her furrowed emerald brows, and the clouds beyond the Great Wall are depicted when the painting scroll opens. She tells of all the sorrows of silks and satins in those days, conveying Zhaojun's feelings to Wenjun." This Shu woman sang and told the story of Zhaojun, and even displayed a painting scroll of Zhaojun departing for the frontier. The title of the poem, "perform," is obviously an abbreviated term for "performing and reciting," which has been used since the Six Dynasties for monks chanting Buddhist scriptures. The term "ballad" should be the meaning of Bianwen. Thirty years ago, handwritten copies from the Li Tang and Five Dynasties periods were discovered in the Dunhuang Stone Chamber in Gansu, including The Great Maudgalyayana Saving His Mother from Hell Bianwen, Shun the Filial Son Bianwen, The Demon Subduing Bianwen, The Jataka Tales Bianwen, etc., totaling thirty or forty types. This literary form mixes prose and verse, with both speaking and singing, seemingly with singing as the center. Recently, I saw Liu Fu's Dunhuang Gleanings, which includes a type tentatively titled Zhaojun's Departure, although the original title is unknown. The text contains many fragments and errors. I will now quote a section describing Zhaojun's death to provide a glimpse.</p>
<p>Since last night, Mingfei has gradually weakened. Because of foreign things, she will mostly not survive. The Xiongnu chief solemnly sacrifices to the mountains and rivers, repeatedly praying to the sun and moon. He seeks methods in every possible way, requesting techniques a thousand times. ...... Just at the third watch, her life came to an end. The Xiongnu chief took off his emperor's clothes and put on the clothing of a commoner. With disheveled hair, he mourned the deceased. The tribal leaders all arrived. Brave warriors did not leave the side of the deceased, and the tribes dared not go east or west. They wailed day and night, unable to stop even for a moment, with sorrowful and poignant tones. How can one describe the place where Mingfei cried!</p>
<p>Zhaojun died at midnight last night, and the Turks sent messengers in haste this morning. Messengers gallop on horseback along the three borders, conveying the Xiongnu chief's orders, while a non-written message is sent ten thousand miles to the Han Emperor. The Xiongnu chief personally attended the mourning on this day, unwilling to leave even for a moment to watch over the deceased. He unsheathed his sword and removed his emperor's hat, letting his hair down and putting on the clothing of a commoner. ...... The cold wind entered the tent, and the sound was still bitter. The dawn sun approached, but the crying had not yet stopped. The nights of sleeping together in the past were so short, but now sleeping alone feels like forever. Who would have thought that she would be so far away from the capital, never again remembering lying in the dark land of the north? If I had known that death would mean burial in the sand, I would have regretted not letting you return to the imperial homeland. This literary form is just like Bianwen. Could this be the Ballad of Zhaojun sung and told by the barbarian prostitute and the Shu woman? Luo Zhenyu's naming it The Biography of Mingfei is certainly not correct, and Hu Shi's naming it The Song of Mingfei is also incorrect. Liu Fu's tentative title of Zhaojun's Departure is still not appropriate. Four years ago, I wrote The Ballad of Zhaojun, which was published in the Nanguo Weekly. I first named it The Ballad of Zhaojun, but it received little attention. Recently, I saw Zheng Zhenduo's Illustrated History of Chinese Literature, which called this text Mingfei Bianwen. I don't know if he saw my article first? I still firmly believe that the name The Ballad of Zhaojun is more justified, and I ask Mr. Hu (Shi), who has a penchant for textual research and history, to agree with my statement.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Javanese Summer <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Renjie</p>
<p>Whenever summer arrives and I feel unbearably hot, I often recall my second hometown, Java, which I left many years ago.</p>
<p>Java has no so-called summer. The climate there is almost the same all year round. People who have never been to Southeast Asia always think that the climate in tropical areas must be very unbearable, but it is not actually the case. For example, in Java, the hottest time of day is only two or three hours, and the rest of the time it is very cool. Sometimes you even have to cover yourself with a blanket at night.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, apart from the very few wealthy people who can escape to distant places like Lushan and Moganshan to avoid the summer heat, it is impossible for the rest of the middle class or those who live on salaries to find a cool place near Shanghai to escape the scorching heat for a few hours. The suburbs of Shanghai are unbearable, full of filth, coffins, and tombs, without a single hill or forest.</p>
<p>But it is not like that in the cities of Southeast Asia. While the wealthy merchants have their own places to spend money, the middle class and those who live on salaries also have their own places to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, one cannot help but thank the Westerners who are always eager to claim that they are civilizing foreign races. Now, the major cities of Java, such as Batavia, have architecture that is so well-organized and streets that are so clean that they are comparable to any city in Europe, not to mention the suburbs outside the cities, which have all been cleaned and beautified by them to an extraordinary degree.</p>
<p>When I lived in Batavia, I often invited two friends to take a motorcycle to the suburbs for a cool breeze in the afternoon when the sun was setting. The motorcycle sped along the wide asphalt road lined with coconut trees, and the cool breeze brushed our faces, dispelling all the summer heat. Looking at the roadside, there were lush green rice fields, shady orchards, dense rubber trees, and neat sugarcane fields, a beautiful scene created by the combination of nature and human effort, truly enough to please the eye and gladden the heart.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we would choose a quiet place to park the motorcycle, either in the open space in front of a native hut or on the deserted ridges of a field. We would spread out the cool mats we had brought, and then one by one, we would take out the phonograph, soda, beer, snacks, etc. from the car. We would sit down and eat, play, and chat. After eating, we would lie down and breathe in the fresh air of the countryside, inhaling the fragrance of plants and trees that could not be breathed in the city, and listening to the singing of insects and birds that could not be heard in the city. Everyone felt that their worldly worries had been completely discarded and unconsciously entered a dreamy world of fairyland. It was not until a crescent moon hung high in the sky that we sat up, packed up our things, and drove back on the clean and cool road.</p>
<p>Is such pleasure something that can be enjoyed in the great Eastern metropolis of Shanghai? The past is like smoke, and when I think back on it, I can only yearn for it.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Ordinary Matters (34) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>"For this matter, let me have Suiwu take care of it! It's easy to handle, easy to do." Then Yongsun called Suiwu over, explained the situation to him, and told him to hurry up and take care of it. Later, he added, "Go find Eulenspiegel first, Suiwu; if you can't negotiate well, then find Romanes and Icarus. Among these three people,"</p>
<p>"There will always be someone who has a solution."</p>
<p>"Okay, Uncle," Suiwu said. "So, from which day do we start?" "Start from New Year's Eve."</p>
<p>"I'll go take care of it tomorrow; you'll get a response immediately." Yongsun, of course, was used to this kind of method, but Lao Wu was truly grateful. As for Zichun, although she initially had some discomforting doubts amidst her pleasure, she later thought that it wouldn't hurt to do this kind of cost-free business a few times in secret, so she treated it with magnanimity. So, this man and woman just stared expectantly, waiting for Suiwu's reply. Little did they know that before two or three o'clock, the patriotic heroes of Zhabei had already begun to implement resistance against the enemy!</p>
<p>This glorious and unprecedented change, which occurred right under the noses of the imperialists, naturally diminished our faith in their paper-tiger-like traditional beliefs. And they also obviously reduced their faith in themselves, so they temporarily blocked all places like the "No. 281" that they had always allowed to be secretly open using the method of covering one's ears while stealing a bell. At the same time, those customers also felt that their material supplies were not as abundant as before, so in the first five or six days, no one had the mind to think about that kind of amusement. We don't need to say that Zichun and Lao Wu had both given up. But after a week, the public's fear of war seemed to have gradually subsided, and since it was just the Lunar New Year, everyone felt a bit itchy, so some people secretly gathered a few like-minded companions and started doing it on a small scale. Someone like our Yongsun, who had a wide range of acquaintances and a strong interest in pleasure, was naturally one of these people. He did it for two or three days and felt dissatisfied, and everyone else also felt dissatisfied. So he thought of Lao Wu again, and then he planned how to fulfill that promise he had made to Lao Wu before.</p>
<p>In fact, his plan was realized in less than three days. The ones who provided the houses for the hideouts were those foreigners wearing tiger skins, like the "Dues" and the "Ness." The ones who provided the capital to be the house were several wealthy friends of Yongsun. The ones who provided the effort to host and split the profits were Lao Wu's "family." In addition, there were people like Suiwu who advertised, handled things, and took care of things outside. These people, who abandoned everything and thought that they could secretly enjoy themselves in a timely manner, amused themselves in the east today and in the west tomorrow. They were really energetic. But little did they know that the police were already regarding them as a flock of fat sheep, just waiting for a way to subdue the shepherd wearing the tiger skin and then catch them all in one fell swoop!</p>
<p>That night, of course, he also happily spent his time at this venue.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the banking sector's annual summer holiday, so naturally there were no major news items to record regarding various collections and deliveries. The call rate increased by one cent, totaling six cents for call loan transactions. Early market transfers amounted to over 4.6 million, new transactions to over 700,000, midday market transactions to over 400,000, small general exchange transactions to over 500,000, and banknotes in and out to over 900,000.

<h3 id="e184">Securities and Bonds Surge, Then Slightly Retrace <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Covering Short Positions Drives Rapid Increase; Rapid Increase Sparks New Short Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw particularly high market sentiment. Due to the tortuous and winding path that the Public Security Bureau took towards reaching peace, bond prices had been brewing for many days and suddenly soared. Market prices had been suppressed for a long time, so the rise was also particularly rapid. The fundamental reason was that the short positions were weakening and the long positions were firm. The decline in the past six days was less than the rise in the past two days, so the short positions became more cautious and covered more quickly, which drove the price up more rapidly. The market opened in the morning at 18, with a large increase of seven cents, and new high prices were discovered. Afterwards, the upward trend was even stronger because various gangs had a great need, and the Northern Gang also slightly covered. The increase was at least one yuan or more, with some such as the current month's Consolidated Tax rising by 1.9 yuan. Several of the September bonds also saw new high prices, and the situation was very good. However, the rapid rise brought in new short positions, and the second round saw the Northern Gang stop covering and the surface-level long positions slightly liquidating. 46 was sold off and still flooded the market. Market prices then largely increased before slightly retracing, with a general retracement of about 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. Gold shorts retraced by 0.8 to 1.1 yuan due to the sale of 46. The trend is that prices may continue to rise due to the resolution of the investigation. The final result was an increase of several cents to 1.78 yuan, with a total turnover of 16,127,300 yuan, including 2,300 yuan in spot goods and 5,785,000 yuan in futures for Consolidated Tax and Salt Tax, 2.28 million yuan for Demobilization, 1.975 million yuan for the 19th customs bonds, and 2.9 million yuan for the 20th customs bonds, with the remainder ranging from several tens of thousands to over one million.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Yarn and Flower Prices Fall Frequently, Then Rebound After Three Days <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market fell for three consecutive days before a sudden rebound. Some profit-takers covered their positions, and the market price then rose. However, actual demand remained sluggish. Various gangs had no purchasing power, mainly because the people were poor and their wealth exhausted, making it difficult for commerce to develop. In addition, the dumping of inferior yarn was very strong, so the future situation was not optimistic.</p>
<p>(Short Covering Drives Up Marked Yarn Prices) The market conditions at the start of the day before the Renbiao market were quite weak, with prices falling by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan in each month. In the second and third rounds, profits were taken and short positions were covered, causing prices to rebound by 0.6, 0.7, and 0.9 yuan in each month. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn sales were stagnant, and prices rose or fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan in each month. The total turnover for the day was 34,900 bales. Sales included 1,600 bales of Changfeng, 1,150 bales of Xincheng, 900 bales of Ruidar, 950 bales of Hengchang, 950 bales of Dafeng, and 800 bales of Suilong. Purchases included 1,650 bales of Renfeng, 1,200 bales of Tonghe, 950 bales of Senkang, 950 bales of Changyu, and 800 bales of Zhenda. The closing prices were as follows: Renbiao Closing Price, Up or Down, Account Balance, November 192.8, Up 8, 55,080, August 185.3, Up 7, 41,600, December 193.9, 7, 31,250, September 189.0, 6, 26,400, January 194.8, 8, 23,50, October 190.7, 6, 80,000, Total 269,300.</p>
<p>(Yarn Sales are Scattered and Fragmented) Spot yarn clearance remained sluggish. It was found that various gangs only purchased a total of 450 bales for the whole day. The market price was similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of each gang were as follows:</p>
<p>Zhenjiang 35, Xiamen 35, Guangdong 30, Luzhou 30, Fellow Traders 55, Wuhu 10, Inland 195, Shantou 40, Yunnan 40.</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose. American cotton remained weak. Due to the good weather in Ningbo, the new cotton production situation was very satisfactory, and large amounts were sold in Shanghai. In addition, a yarn factory there went out of business and has already closed, selling off part of its raw materials. However, large numbers of profitable shorts covered their positions in Shanghai, and the market then rebounded. In the afternoon, heavy rain fell, greatly benefiting the cotton fields.</p>
<p>(Marked Flower Initially Weak, Then Strong) The market conditions at the start of the day before the Zheng Biao market saw American cotton trending down, and the Ningbo gang sold off in large quantities, causing prices to fall. Later, the short side covered, causing prices to rebound by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, prices rose again by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The total turnover for the day was 85,600 dan. Sales included 5,500 dan of Yuanxingchang, 2,100 dan of Yifeng, 1,900 bales of Yu Chang, 4,000 dan of Renfeng, 2,700 dan of Suilong, 3,100 dan of Yuanda, and 1,700 dan of Dafeng. Purchases included 3,500 dan of Shenchang, 2,200 dan of Yuda, 1,700 dan of Zhenda, and 4,800 dan of Hengde. The closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Biao Closing Price, Up or Down, Account Balance, December 43.70, Up 1, 580, 50,000, August 46.95, Up 1, 512, 65,000, January 43.75, 2, 039, 10,000, October 43.90, 0, 513, 52,000, Total 507,900, November 43.70, 2, 012, 76,000.</p>

<p>Spot cotton business remains quiet, with no trading occurring.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Bombay Cotton Market Quiet Last Week <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Bombay cotton market was quiet last week due to speculators' lack of interest in American cotton news, causing business to be slow. Market prices did not fall along with foreign markets. In terms of spot goods, business was particularly sluggish. Chinese inquiries returned to quiet after once being made. European inquiries were all of a scattered nature. The condition of the textile industry did not improve due to a lack of demand for yarn and cloth. The monsoon season was quite satisfactory, and the recent heavy rains have greatly benefited the harvest. The statistics for last week are attached below: (Unit: Thousand Bales)</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipt Since September 1st, 1932, 1933, 1999, 2485. Spot Inventory at Week's End, 77, 680, 69. Cumulative Exports Since September 1st, 91, 316, 00. Shipments to Europe, 146, 395.</p>
<p>Shipments to China, 209, 123.</p>
<p>Shipments to Japan, 5201, 056. Other Regions, 38, 24.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Grain - Thin Rice Continues to Fall by a Few Cents <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources totaled over 30. The appetite of shops on this street was slightly better, but the situation remained sluggish. Market conditions therefore saw higher prices stabilize, while secondary prices continued to decline. Prices for common gang, Su Tong gang, and South Port varieties of japonica rice were inconsistent. Dujian was average, while Yangjian continued to decline by a few cents. Package appetite remained sluggish. Only the Weihaiwei gang brought in 600 bags. The thin rice market situation again presented a further decline, with prices again declining by a few cents. The Yin Yuan was not widely distributed and remained low. The presentation of the new Shandong province remained stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Sources from various routes in Hexia totaled 16 or 17. The distribution of various goods on the market remained sluggish. White japonica declined by several fen, thin japonica declined, and early rice and small near corner also declined slightly. Bai Yuan declined by a small amount. The Dujiangjian stood firm, but the shipment of new japonica was slightly scarce and the clearance continued to move, and the price situation was stabilizing.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Xiangjing Rice Discounted by Two Coppers <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for Xiang rice were stagnant, and the demand was weak. There were no transactions for foreign rice throughout the city. Although foreign merchants were willing to lower prices to facilitate transactions, local dealers, due to the large amount of rice in storage locally, were asking for a discount of two coppers, which was too far from what sellers were willing to accept. A small negotiation involving 2,000 bags failed to reach an agreement. Although the arrival and storage of Xiang rice were both low, the local market lacked appetite. Dealers from Zhejiang and Fujian provinces were quoting low prices based on the sales prices in their respective ports, with a wait-and-see attitude. Even when responding to inquiries, they were determined not to proceed unless the price was low. As a result, Hunan Jing rice was discounted by two coppers, and 114 bags were purchased by Fujian dealers. Hunan machine-made red rice was in short supply in the market and was being inquired about by northern dealers. Although it was somewhat affected by Jing rice, it did not fall in price, and 120 bags were purchased by Ningbo dealers at a price of 7.3 yuan, similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Recently, Yingkou Dealers Searched for Flour <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>60,000 to 70,000 Bags Traded, Market Begins to Improve. Yesterday, the flour market was generally flat and soft in all months after the opening of the first session in the morning. Due to the weakness of the past week and the continued hedging by various factories, the market was difficult to improve despite the rise in foreign wheat. Moreover, there were rumors that a large amount of Russian flour was being sought in Tianjin, and there was a possibility of a transaction, with Tianjin prices already lowered by one or two points. Therefore, people were not optimistic. Suddenly, Yingkou dealers arrived in the market to search for near-term contracts, showing great interest and trading 60,000 to 70,000 bags. The market was then pushed up by bulls, gradually rising and turning weakness into strength. As a result, the situation was very good. If there is real sales support again today, the market can stabilize. The closing price for August and December was 7.75 points higher, September was 1.25 points higher, October was 1 point higher, November was 0.25 points higher, and January was 0.5 points higher.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Many Hedging Sales of Forward Wheat <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market trended flat and soft again because American wheat was already being shipped. Local flour mills did not have a strong appetite for wheat, and their wheat storage was large with continuous arrivals. Flour mills had ample flour stocks and moderate sales, and they did not have a strong interest in trading either forward or spot wheat. Although foreign wheat rose yesterday, it did not affect the domestic surplus situation. Although there was short covering after the market opened, both brokerage firms and inland merchants engaged in hedging sales. After the market opened, all months continued to show weakness. As a result, the current month was unchanged, September and October were each down two points, November was down one point, December was unchanged, and January rose one or two points in the morning. There was no trading in the afternoon. Taiwanese wheat was 3.8 yuan, secondary was 3.78 yuan, Daqiao was 3.7 yuan, Ying was 3.45 yuan, Yangzhou was 3.6 yuan, and secondary was 3.55 yuan. A total of 2,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Miscellaneous Grains Are All Sluggish <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Transactions in old miscellaneous grains were very light, relying entirely on new soybeans to liven up the market. However, due to the surge in new soybean supplies, buyers were bound to bid prices down, and the market showed a downward trend. Old soybeans were also sluggish. New mung beans were not being received. Yesterday, 98 bags of Yaowan hairy mung beans arrived in the market and were purchased by Fuzhou dealers at a price of 4.7 yuan, slightly higher than the initial offer. Old mung beans were sluggish due to clearance sales. Foreign firms have been inactive in the rapeseed market recently, and the market outlook is soft. Broad beans are also in a flat and sluggish state. Sesame seeds saw some activity from Ningbo and Shaoxing dealers, with little gains or losses. Raw peanuts have fallen and have no formal market.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Sugar Market: High-Quality Coarse Sand White Marked at 21 Yuan <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Although the sugar market was not affected by changes in the gold standard and exchange rates yesterday, the trend remained tight. The guild marked ordinary grade coarse sand white sugar at 20.9 yuan, which was not achieved. High-quality double T mark sugar was marked at 21 yuan, with some transactions. There was no trading in the 20th grade medium sand white sugar, priced at approximately 20.2 yuan. Dutch red KNG mark sugar was 16.35 yuan, KD mark was priced at 15 yuan. Taikoo sugar rose by five points, with B mark sugar at 21 yuan. China Benbing No. 1 was 23.5 yuan, No. 2 was 23.3 yuan, and No. 3 large bag ice was 22.6 yuan, up two or three points from before. Mianbai top grade was 20.1 yuan, and No. 1 was 19.9 yuan, with the remainder returned. Guohua was priced the same. Zhenji No. 1 mianbai was marked at 20 yuan, but no transaction was made. Chaozhou dealers offered 200 bags of imported raw sugar at 15.2 yuan, 14.9 yuan, and 15 yuan, to prevent further tightening.</p>
<h3 id="e194">North-South Goods: Lily Flowers Rose and Then Fell <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Since the arrival of new lily flowers, sales have been brisk, and prices have risen. Now, with the gradual increase in arrivals, the quotations have softened again. Daxing vegetables opened at 0.5 yuan lower, at 17.5 yuan, with the next grade at 17 yuan, showing signs of further weakening. Wholesale prices were 18.6 yuan, with the next grade varying around 17 yuan, and the market outlook was flat.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Hot and Humid Weather Affects Autumn Silkworms <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Shaoxing's Early Batch of Autumn Silkworms Undergoes Changes. The amount of autumn silkworms raised in the four villages of Shaoxing has not decreased. The early batch of spring silkworms has already entered the second molt and opened leaves for many days. Mulberry leaf prices are high, with clean leaves priced at 1.7 to 1.8 yuan. The weather was hot and humid the day before yesterday, and the early silkworms have undergone changes, with most stopping feeding and becoming stiff. Instructors are currently working to take care of them.</p>
<p>The Quantity of Silk Waste Exported Last Month Decreased. In recent years, the European sales of silk cocoon waste from our country have shown no improvement. The quantity of silk waste exported last month (July) decreased, with a total of only 1,759 piculs exported for the entire month, a decrease of more than 200 piculs compared to June.</p>
<p>More Than 200 Picul of Shandong Raw Silk Shipped to England. The British mail ship Ranchi Puto left this morning, carrying 230 piculs of Shandong Daer raw silk, jointly owned by Xiangmao and others in this port, to England.</p>
<p>Foreign Firm Silk Market Closed Yesterday Due to the Summer Festival. Yesterday was the Summer Festival, and most Chinese and foreign banks closed as usual. British and American foreign firms in this port were all closed for a day. There was no market for either foreign firm silk or rayon.</p>
<p>New York Raw Silk Consumption Greatly Reduced. Last month, a labor strike occurred at silk weaving factories in New York, with more than 70,000 workers in the city on strike, resulting in a significant reduction in raw silk sales. In July, the total consumption of silk was only 44,597 bales, a decrease of 9,030 bales compared to the previous month (June).</p>
<p>Another Large Batch of Rayon Imported. The Italian mail ship Rossaberg Duke arrived the day before yesterday, carrying 950 cases of rayon from Italy, Germany, England, and France, which were stored in customs warehouses.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Needle, Eyebrow, and Pearl Tea Transactions Are Booming <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market in this port, firms such as Jilong, Yihe, and Xiehe purchased needle, eyebrow, and pearl tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi in bulk, and transactions were extremely prosperous. There has been no major development in the sales of Zhenmei from Tunxi and Huixian, but the stock in the market is only 8,000 to 9,000 boxes, and the supply is becoming increasingly short. Chinese tea merchants have a firm attitude, and the market has been stable. Qimen black tea was purchased by both Jilong Foreign Firm and China Tea Company yesterday. Due to the small amount of stock in the market, the prices have risen to 108 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan from before, and there is still insufficient demand.</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Brisk Sales of Domestic Piece Goods and Woolens <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Domestic woolen products have been increasing year by year like bamboo shoots after a rain, especially the number of camel hair factories. Woven products include tarpaulin bags, yellow twill brown, Ma Zong sleeve lining, and mercerized feather yarn. Woolen products include tight camel hair yellow flannel, plain serge Huate flannel, French flannel suit flannel, Ma Ding flannel white serge overcoat flannel, and the like. Sales are good, especially camel hair transactions are the most prosperous, followed by yellow flannel and mercerized feather yarn sleeve mourning Ma Zong. Recently, our dealer group has continued to make large transactions. Other goods are slightly inferior because the selling prices are too high.</p>

<h3 id="e199">The High and Low Prices of Jellyfish Are Mutually Different by Zheng Xintian <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>丨A Commoner's Dish in Shanghai… A Delicacy on the Table in Sichuan丨Jellyfish is a unique marine product of our country. The scientific name is medusa, also known as Shimu, belonging to coelenterate animals. It is shaped like an open fabric, semi-smooth and soft. The color is light blue, and the thin skin is commonly known as "jellyfish skin." Below are eight arms, extending like handles, with a light red color, commonly known as "jellyfish head."</p>
<p>Jellyfish is mainly produced in Daishan, Huanglong, and Sijiao and other small islands in Dinghai, Zhejiang. Every year in May, as the mold spreads, these types of jellyfish appear in the nearby seas, floating on the surface. Fishermen catch them and place them in large barrels. They are soaked in salt and alum for about three or four times. The water gradually decreases, and the color also turns slightly yellow. Then they are taken out and stacked in bamboo fences, covered with mesh-shaped bamboo filaments. Each piece is about two and a half feet high and weighs about 300 jin. After being packed, they are transported to Shanghai and sold to salted fish shops or seafood shops.</p>
<p>To distinguish the quality of jellyfish, the "Chen" character in the common saying "Chen jellyfish" is sufficient to describe it. "Old is precious." Jellyfish skin must have 1) a bright yellow color, 2) large round sheets, and 3) a dry and thin texture. Those that meet these criteria are considered good. Jellyfish heads are similar, but the color should be white and tender. Red ones are fresh and not crisp when eaten. Jellyfish is produced in the near sea, so the selling price is extremely cheap. Jellyfish skin is about 11 or 12 yuan per dan, while jellyfish head is only about 6 yuan. In small vegetable markets, one or two hundred wen can buy a large sheet. People appreciate its cheapness and because it is easy to wash and has a crisp and delicious taste, everyone likes to eat it. The proverb "jellyfish radish shreds..." is used because it is cool and refreshing, has a unique flavor, and is deeply in line with the common people's taste.</p>
<p>In addition to being sold in this port, the largest sales outside the port are from the Guangdong and Sichuan dealer groups. People in those areas regard jellyfish as a treasure, especially in Sichuan. The further away from the sea, the more difficult it is to obtain, and the more frequent the transportation along the way. The cost is high, and it cannot be sold for less than five or six jiao per jin in Sichuan. Sichuan gentry use it when entertaining guests, while common people feel a sense of inhibition, which is close to being aristocratic. It is the same thing, but the high and low prices are mutually different in different places. Things are valued when they are rare. This is true of jellyfish, and it is true of everything. The essence of things has no inherent value.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Entered the Zoo <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Xin</p>
<p>Every time the wind is cold or the heat is oppressive, I realize that another semester is coming to an end. These past two days, I rushed to hand in the students' exam papers to the academic affairs office, so I felt extraordinarily relaxed and refreshed, as if I had cleared a heavy burden! At the same time, this also means that my life as an elementary school teacher has passed another semester. But what have I gained in a semester?! The factual answer is truly heartbreaking! It seems that this has become a common phenomenon. Many people always ridicule and despise elementary school teachers. They seem to think that elementary school teachers are insignificant. The reason for this is that the current elementary school teachers are too complex. There are all kinds of people. Almost anyone who has nothing to do and can hum a few sentences has stepped onto this teaching platform. Therefore, the status of elementary school teachers has invisibly declined. However, the entire glory of being an elementary school teacher is completely bankrupt because of this. Is this people's arrogance or the cruelty of the times? ...</p>
<p>This time, I went to do this thing voluntarily. I mustered up the courage and spirit to take the risk. I was not subjected to any pressure or driven by life or dominated by the environment, and no one encouraged me. I wanted to adjust my life. I needed to be close to the innocence of children, because only in innocence can I find the truth. But half a year of experience tells me that I can't help but feel infinite sadness! In the past ten years, I have been detained in dark and sunless church schools. Although I had previously attended co-educational schools, it was only in that one year when I was very young. So when I first came to this school with male and female colleagues and classmates, I couldn't help but feel another kind of situation and feel unnatural, especially since it was my first time working. But after thinking it through, I blamed myself for being too pedantic and too shallow! Since I have embarked on the journey of society, if I need true equality between men and women, then why do I have these unnecessary scruples? So I boldly started talking to them. In fact, talking is just this one thing. But one thing that made me strange was that colleagues usually wear different masks and suspect each other. Is this probably the so-called art of dealing with the world? I was originally very childish, always speaking frankly and casually. Later, I gradually realized that I was too naive, so I pretended to be mature. So I joined a huge dye vat, drifting away my inherent innocence, stained with the art of dealing with the world. As for the mask, of course, it was unconditionally added! However, this kind of behavior is so against my conscience!</p>
<p>The age of elementary school students is too uneven. The students in the senior classes are quite old. Some are even older than me, and some are taller than me. But when they come to the office to talk to me, they first take off their hats and salute and reveal their innocent naivety. Only this is enough to make me feel an unspeakable emotion and situation! Ah, but where do I start? Because their actions are all fake! The disappointment and trauma this gave me are so profound! I have deeply entered the zoo, and all around me are hideous and terrifying!</p>
<p>Even so, I have never compromised. I want to avoid the past - this cursed past, and I am not afraid to look forward to the future - this illusory and elusive future. I should fight with my strength to create, to create the present - a bright present!</p>

<p>I am a Confucian scholar who also loves calligraphy and painting. After giving up the imperial examination, I taught for twenty years. In my old age, I was unable to do so, so I came to Shanghai to paint landscapes. I had no entry to formal training in the area where heroes gather. I dare not show off my small skills. Driven by the environment, I had to follow Mao Sui's self-recommendation. I hope that the great masters will not laugh at me. Ma Henian.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Mrs. Zhang's Kitten <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>The little tabby cat that had been missing for three days was meowing at my feet again during lunch. It looked even more haggard, thin, and pitifully gazed up at me like a dying beggar. I couldn't help but think of the little tabby cat's owner, Mrs. Zhang.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang was a kind old woman around fifty years old. Three years ago, she rented a small room in my house and lived alone. She had no relatives coming and going, and she never stepped out of the door. She also didn't like to talk, like other older women who liked to nag about the affairs of the west family and the gossip of the east family. After living here for a long time, she didn't have much contact with the neighbors. Occasionally, when she met them at the door, she would say a few words about the weather today and whether they had eaten, and then bow her head to caress the little tabby cat in her arms. It was her only companion and only way to pass the long years. Mrs. Zhang mixed with it like a child, sometimes murmuring to it, seeming to tell the little tabby cat her pitiful life story. But what did the little tabby cat know? It only meowed, but in Mrs. Zhang's ears, the little tabby cat's meows were an expression of sympathy for her. The little tabby cat was indeed very cute, with a small body, a pair of emerald green eyes shining on both sides of its black nose, two yellow circles on its back, like two Bagua diagrams on a Taoist's python robe, and its whole body was snow-white. When it chased butterflies in the green grass, it looked like a rabbit.</p>
<p>Time urged people to age, and Mrs. Zhang had lived in our small room for a year. She was still as silent and lonely as when she first came. Other than eating, drinking, and sleeping, she played with her little tabby cat, or she had a few more strands of white hair.</p>
<p>That autumn, I got married, and relatives and neighbors all sent gifts to congratulate me. When they saw my mother, they shouted "Congratulations" and "Blessings," which aroused Mrs. Zhang's sorrow. She thought that doing happy events would bring good luck, so she went back to her small room alone and cried loudly. Finally, a neighbor woman found out her life story.</p>
<p>Her family was also of middle-class origin. Her husband ran a southern goods store in the city with his own funds, and their life was of course well-off. However, after they got married, they had no children. They sought signs and divinations all year round, built bridges and paved roads. It was not until she was in her thirties that she got her wish and gave birth to a son. Needless to say, the couple loved him like a treasure. Later, after the father died, the child was spoiled and stole money from home to gamble and visit prostitutes. The southern goods store lost too much money and finally closed down. He stole Mrs. Zhang's clothes and jewelry and never returned.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang cried and said, my son is here, and he is as big as the young master of the landlord. When I see other people's sons getting married, I think of my own son, and I can't help but cry.</p>
<p>After this secret was revealed, the neighbors all felt sorry for Mrs. Zhang and were very close to her because of her taciturn and silent smile.</p>
<p>Last year was also a summer with cicadas chirping. Four soldiers came to our street, saying that they were ordered by the officer in charge to pick up Mrs. Zhang. The villagers couldn't bear to see people carrying guns and secretly discussed it, thinking that Mrs. Zhang might be some kind of secret figure. I asked clearly the surname of their officer, which was exactly Mrs. Zhang's son. Mrs. Zhang was so happy at that time that she just recited Buddha in the sky, packed a little valuables, and left with the four soldiers. She said that she would ask her son to come and thank the landlord and all the neighbors in a few days. Now it is summer again with cicadas chirping. We have not known her whereabouts since then, but the cute little tabby cat left behind has not seen its owner and does not think about eating and drinking all day long, meowing and rolling at my feet, seeming to ask me where its owner has gone. Looking at its more haggard and thin body, I can't help but think of Mrs. Zhang.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Gandhi of India Opens <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Fei</p>
<p>In India recently there lived a great man. His name Gandhi is known throughout the globe. He knew the pain of a fallen people. Nonviolent resistance to strong England. His actions are strange and eccentric. He often goes around naked. He was arrested several times without fear. He often fasts with a firm determination. This ambition is admirable. He won't stop until his goal is achieved. He is willing to sacrifice his life. He only wishes the Indian people to be self-governed. The authorities are therefore jealous of him. They arbitrarily arrest him and imprison him. The news from the former dynasty came quickly. It said that Gandhi had been imprisoned again. He abandoned the monastery he had practiced in that year. He encouraged his comrades with moving words. The case concerns politics, no small matter. The judgment must be two years. British planes demonstrated their power. They flew over the whole village of Kotkai. All the villagers fled. There was not a single person in the village. Gandhi was originally an important person.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Ever-Elusive Bedbug <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Shanghai has many bedbugs; this is no exaggeration. Their traces can be found in almost everything you use, wear, and eat. For example, in the bed you sleep on, the stool you sit on, the clothes you wear, even in the food you eat. I once saw bedbugs on the shiny, oiled paper wrapping bread! This is the most remarkable news I have encountered in my life. However, it's only because I'm new to Shanghai. Old Shanghai hands are used to it and wouldn't make a fuss.</p>
<p>Recently, because I've been preparing for school entrance exams, I've been studying and thinking hard every day, not daring to rest for a moment. From eight o'clock in the morning to twelve, and from one o'clock to five in the afternoon, I'm using my brain for almost ten hours a day. By evening, I'm extremely tired. The weather is also so hot, and because I don't like sweating, I can't go to sleep early. So, I always have to wait until nine o'clock before I can sleep soundly. This, of course, is the happiest and sweetest time of my day. Needless to say, I fall asleep the moment I touch the pillow. But who knew that less than twenty minutes into my peaceful sleep, those hateful bedbugs would come to invade me, preventing me from sleeping soundly, waking me from my sweet dreams? When I touched my body, I felt many tiny, raised, flesh-colored bumps. These raised areas looked red and swollen and felt itchy and painful. At first, I was still drowsy and just scratched a few times before falling back asleep. But who knew the second invasion would again prevent me from sleeping? I had no choice but to get up, turn on the light, and go back to the bed to catch them. I searched almost all around the bed, but I couldn't see a single bedbug. I was really puzzled at this point. I clearly knew that bedbugs were harassing me, but how come I couldn't see them? Being sleepy, I had to go back to sleep drowsily, too lazy to investigate the matter further. But in an instant, I was disturbed in the same way again! I tried again, and when I turned on the light, the invaders had again escaped to the ninth heaven. I hated it! I was amazed! How could such tiny creatures have such nimble senses and clever instincts? Can't humans compete and win against them? At that moment, I was already extremely tired, and the god of sleep was relentlessly surrounding me. I had no choice but to go back to sleep. But after the fourth disturbance, I came up with a plan. I woke up the person in the same room as me and asked her to turn on the light for me. Haha! As expected, human intelligence eventually prevailed. At that moment, I found many small, red bedbugs crawling all over me, looking smug. But could they still escape? In less than five minutes, I had caught them all. Only then could I sleep peacefully until the next day.</p>
<p>And what about the next day? I really can't continue to imagine! The next night, weren't they still active? And there were even more of them, and their fighting power was even fiercer. I was already at my wit's end. But in this helplessness, I understood! "They are entirely for the sake of survival!"</p>

<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(25) It's alright if your hair is curly, as long as your heart is upright. '...General XX graduated from the Japanese Military Academy and has held important military positions in the Northeast. Since Zhang Xueliang surrendered the three provinces without resistance, General XX was filled with righteous indignation and automatically commanded his troops to resist the enemy on the XX border. Recently, due to running out of ammunition and supplies, he has come to Shanghai to personally represent the army, hoping that patriotic people from all walks of life will generously donate to him, so that the recovery of lost territory can be hoped for. Now, please welcome General XX to give a speech and report on the situation on the battlefield.' As usual, there was a round of applause. General XX wore a worn-out Zhongshan suit, showing his identity as a veteran of many battles. However, his curly hair and delicate hands were out of keeping with his appearance. But who would pay attention to these details? Moreover, our General had already stood up, and there was another round of applause as usual. The situation at the front that he reported was roughly the same as that reported by the previous representatives who came to Shanghai, so it doesn't need to be described in detail. However, he had a special insight that was admired by the audience. He said:</p>
<p>'…Although we have gone through so many battles, we absolutely do not want to boast and brag in order to win the beautiful name of national hero. Maybe the Chinese people know very little about our army. We only hope to die for the sake of saving the country, and die without a heroic name.'</p>
<p>Therefore, Hu Yuanliang immediately proposed that the XX Association should allocate a donation of X thousands to be taken to the front by General XX. Even those who opposed it were too embarrassed to raise their objections, so the proposal was passed without dissent.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Wang Huaxi accompanied General XX back to the residence. This Wang residence was naturally no longer the small attic room of the past. The living room was decorated quite luxuriously. Mrs. Wang had already excused herself and gone upstairs. Here, Wang Hua closed the door of the front hall and, half-walking, half-jumping, pulled General XX to sit down beside him. He wanted to say something triumphant at first, but later he felt that the matter was not over and that there was still a need to pay attention to it, so he said:</p>
<p>'Yi Ping, what we need to pay attention to now is your feelings for the XX News Agency in the North. Although you fooled everyone today with your words about wanting to be an unknown hero, now that you are famous, you need the XX News Agency to constantly fabricate news from the front to publish in the newspapers. If you are exposed, it won't be a laughing matter. How about sending a telegram tonight?'</p>
<p>The General pondered for a long time and replied in a sophisticated manner:</p>
<p>'Old Wang, you have been in the game for nothing your whole life. Since I'm somewhat confident, if XX doesn't want to fabricate news for us, it's okay, since we've already agreed on several tens of thousands, we can just send them more money. Even if they really refuse, we might as well mobilize the Japanese radio station in Qinhuangdao, because recently the strategy of the Japanese military is to create false numbers and false victory news about the Northeast Volunteer Army in China in order to calmly prepare their strength in our false display of power and eliminate the Volunteer Army, while the country is deceived by the victorious situation and does not make further preparations. Therefore, their radio station in Qinhuangdao specializes in catching shadows and spreading all kinds of news about the Volunteer Army. It's a pity that the news received by Chinese news agencies is mostly broadcast by Qinhuangdao. In this case, even if the XX News Agency understands our inside story and doesn't publish it, they can't prevent other news agencies from doing so!'</p>
<p>The clever General began to unbutton his Zhongshan suit, revealing a snow-white shirt inside. A scent of perfume mixed with body heat wafted out, but there was no sweaty smell of a soldier. Wang Hua became excited and said with a flourish:</p>
<p>'Wonderful, wonderful! Then, I'll quickly ask Yuanliang to write a news report saying that you will be setting off tomorrow to the front. Actually, you have to personally go to Qinhuangdao. I think you should take five thousand first, and then I'll send the rest.'</p>
<p>As Wang Hua stood up to go out, the General had already taken off his Zhongshan suit, put on his own handsome Western-style suit, and went to the mirror to tie his tie. He suddenly noticed his curly hair and wondered if it had given him away at today's meeting, but he immediately smiled and joked:</p>
<p>"It's alright if your hair is curly, as long as your heart is upright!"</p>
<p>(26) Zhou Shaoping's Last Letter Li Shiqiao had not returned to his own room at all. He spent his days walking around the homes of some fellow villagers, chatting idly and wandering about in an attempt to dispel the pain in his heart.</p>
<p>On the third day, he went to inquire about Zhou Shaoping's condition again. As soon as he arrived at the hospital, the nurse who recognized Li Shiqiao said to him:</p>

<h3 id="e206">Fairbanks and Pickford Agree to Divorce <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Lonely Palm</p>
<p>I remember five or six years ago when the movie martial arts star Douglas Fairbanks and his wife, "America's Sweetheart" Mary Pickford, came to Shanghai, they caused a sensation among movie fans. Last year, Fairbanks came to Shanghai again, but he was alone. Mary Pickford was in Hollywood, guarding her empty room. This was already a bit strange. Recently, I received a telegram from Los Angeles that Fairbanks and Pickford are negotiating a divorce! And Fairbanks' house on Pevirely Hills is also being put up for sale.</p>
<p>As for the clues to Fairbanks and Pickford's divorce, they can be recounted as follows. The Los Angeles telegram stated that Pickford's own reason for the divorce was incompatibility, and there was no other reason. Before this statement was made, Fairbanks and Pickford had already separated a few years ago. The first time Fairbanks went to Europe, he said it was for a business vacation. He later came to the East, and after being unknown for a long time, he made a hunting movie. He left his wife in Hollywood, saying that Pickford did not like to travel.</p>
<p>The second time, he and his son, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., went to London again. At that time, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. had just divorced Joan Crawford. He said it was a vacation and travel, and again said that Pickford did not like to travel. But Pickford had indeed traveled to England and Italy several times. Fairbanks said in Shanghai last time that he wanted to make a movie with Pickford in Shanghai. If the divorce is successful, this matter will inevitably become a bubble.</p>
<p>Fairbanks and Pickford were married in 1920. At that time, Pickford was 26 years old. When she married Fairbanks, she had just divorced Owen Moore. The reason for her divorce from Owen Moore was that he had abandoned her on their honeymoon, leaving for three days and then returning. Pickford recently inherited a £200,000 legacy from her mother's will.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Film Review of "Husband's Secret" <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>(A Paramount Production)</p>
<p>On such a hot summer day, going into the cool, air-conditioned Grand Theater to see such a delicate and sweet film, I think everyone must feel very satisfied. If we don't want to gain any new enlightenment or lessons from this film, then from the standpoint of entertainment, this kind of film can give people a feeling of relaxation and pleasure. And this view is not completely without social basis. I think the people who can leisurely walk into the Grand Theater, their original purpose is to enjoy themselves to the fullest.</p>
<p>At the same time, the main target audience for the production of such films is the highly educated Ladies and Centieman, so they strive for perfection in form. Anyway, this kind of audience will never be like the illiterate people who are excluded from the walls of the art palace, and they are unfathomable about the colorful European and American films. So in this sense, the author of "Husband's Secret" is very worthy of the appreciation of some audiences for being so exaggerated in his performance.</p>
<p>The director's technique is lively and compact, which is something that no one can ignore. For example, a group of swindling gamblers take a huge sum of money, and each of them puts on a tall hat and gets into the car, shaking hands and saying goodbye. Then the black curtain is uncovered, and its skillful technique unfolds the consistent light and fluttering mood of the future here. Furthermore, the protagonist sneaks away to a small town to pursue a woman who has not experienced the world. Although there are inevitable "coincidences" in the story, the performance of this love affair is very interesting and does not stick to the old ways. In particular, the fortune-telling with money to get engaged and the sketches in the car after the marriage are all extremely simple scenes. However, this long process is narrated in a very compact and clear manner. Perhaps these are not things that ordinary people can understand, but they are precisely the cleverness of the director. There are many similar scenes, such as the wife handing the bedroom key to the husband, such as the wife deliberately causing the husband to lose money, etc. Especially at the end, when the husband returns home from prison, the husband lies, the wife knows everything, and the matter ends there, which is even lighter. However, it is said that there are many more things later, but they are completely omitted from the film. In addition to the above, several main actors such as Clark Gable and Carole Lombard are just right. Dorothy McKail, who starred in "Red Passion and Green Meaning", only plays an unimportant supporting role here, but it is not a success.</p>
<p>What should be said again should be the content. As mentioned earlier, the content is very empty, and they are only working very hard on the form. However, we cannot ignore that the author is a very law-abiding artist, so the person with bad character is finally influenced by his wife and his conscience is discovered, and he voluntarily requests punishment. Precisely because of this, this is a fantasy that is 108,000 miles away from reality, so his preaching task is very clearly expressed.</p>

<p>— Wan Shi</p>
<p>This film is another ordinary production from Columbia.</p>
<p>Regardless of who is acting here, no one has the power to appeal. Even in terms of the acting skills of this film, they are almost all mediocre and vulgar. They can neither surpass the crowd nor are they very stagnant and rigid. The so-called "Doctrine of the Mean" is considered to have produced one more film. However, the two male and female protagonists are indeed acting sincerely, which is more commendable.</p>
<p>However, the failure of the entire play is definitely not just due to insufficient performance. The play itself has no value in existence. Of course, love tricks have already made people tired, let alone this love is a mediocre fabrication. For example, if the author wants to write about the greed of rich people for women, he can only monotonously describe him using money to buy love. At the same time, he promotes love above all else on the front, so the wealthy girl who is good at socializing terminates the contract with the rich man and elopes with the poor aviator. In this way, not only is there a significant contradiction in the behavior of the wealthy girl who gambles as much as she wants, but also this emphasis on the development of love makes the aviator's painstaking efforts in scientific research take a secondary position, and even just an accompaniment to the progress of love. As for the seduction of the aviator's sister, it is even more of an unimportant insertion. Although this is a more real life.</p>
<p>Since it is a plain and empty content, naturally there will not be amazing results in form. Although the director still has success in small places, such as writing about the night of intimacy of the couple, only focusing on the hats and skirts, and the (OK) on the flight and the car, they are all clever. The entire performance, of course, has a fairly clear narration, but this is only as clear and smooth as a primary school student writing an essay. As for the beginning, development, turn, and conclusion of the article, they are rarely used here. Therefore, a vulgar story finally gives people a vulgar impression due to the vulgar performance. After watching this film, I can only write this little opinion. In this way, the permission may not be sufficient, but such a movie can only teach people to write such superficial articles.</p>
<h3 id="e209">My Opinion on "The New Robin Hood" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Confused</p>
<p>"The New Robin Hood" is entirely a story of foreign seven swords and thirteen heroes. The son of the Spanish Grand Duke, Genkham Muratay, uses his very erratic actions, very magical disguise, and fights against the three thugs who destroyed his family. Finally, the thugs kill each other by mistake and die. The consciousness of this film is that it does not need to be criticized, it is just the fantasy of the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects, the director seems to want to make the development of the story as erratic as possible, and this is quite achieved.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, the performance of the male protagonist is also very erratic. This is the assimilation of the actor and the character in the play. Even if there is a good director, this kind of place cannot be achieved by an ordinary actor, especially the magnificence of the physique and the heroic posture, which are very suitable for the conditions of a strong man. But the most successful thing about "The New Robin Hood" is "disguise". Genkham Muratay appears several times in the play, and there is not a single appearance and appearance that is the same. What is particularly exciting is the twitching of the "black shadow". Because there is a wonderful snake in the grass here. When the audience sees the black shadow, they know that Genkham Muratay is coming. So wait nervously. I remember that Tarzan of the Apes had Tarzan's long roar as a clue, and "The New Robin Hood" used the black shadow as a clue, which was extremely successful.</p>
<p>Naturally, "The New Robin Hood" also has unreasonable places, that is, Colonel Reich does not investigate Genkham's behavior! Xu Genkham and his beloved daughter got married for no reason, because Reich had offered a reward to capture Genkham!</p>

<p>Marlene Hawkins' position was created by her broken bone. Maybe some people will find it strange, but this thing is real.</p>
<p>When Marlene Hawkins was a child, she accidentally broke her ankle bone at school. Later, after treatment, her ankle bone returned to its original shape. Later, she graduated and studied singing and dancing. She went to New York to perform dance skills in a dance hall on Broadway. Once, because she was too careless, her old broken ankle bone broke again. This time the doctor told her that she could no longer dance. After she recovered, she gave up her dancing career and engaged in drama. Later, she entered the film industry, and since then she has gradually become a movie star. Isn't her success as a star caused by her ankle bone?</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Moral Code of Movie Stars <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Xingxing</p>
<p>No one has violated it in eleven years. In 1922, the giants of various film companies gathered and decided to include the "Moral Cause" in each contract.</p>
<p>The occurrence of this clause is green to the RoscoeFattyArbukle rape and murder case in San Francisco at that time. Although Albukie was acquitted, the American Women's Club banned him from sending the screen again. In order to prevent similar cases from happening in the future, the film company strictly set rules. If an actor commits an act that harms the reputation of the silver screen, the company can immediately cancel his contract. No one has committed this "moral code" for eleven years. One point is that it is worth praising the various companies. They cited this rule, regardless of gender, regardless of big stars and small roles, they treat them equally. Even Greta Garbo's contract has such a clause. Finally, someone discovered that Jack Koppel's contract did not use this clause. Try to imagine Koppel's young age, does he need this clause?</p>
<p>Anne Harding and George Arliss hesitated. They are afraid that the company will not trust their noble character, so they are hesitant to move forward. As a result, the "moral code" that the company has contracted has been reduced. After Anne Harding and Harry Bnmister got married, people called her a good woman from Hollywood. As for Arliss, she is old and virtuous, and is an extraordinary person. Then, why should the company do this? Of course, stars without shortcomings do not like to have such sentences in their contracts, and they do not like the kind of unnecessary opinions in the company. They may even quit because of it. They admit that in order to achieve even the smallest things, they are willing to sacrifice excellent contracts.</p>

<p>— One Hand</p>
<p>The second morning, during breakfast at the Ziggesters' house, everyone had different thoughts, except for Alaric, who was still able to eat. Mrs. Ziggister grumbled that Pang was truly ungrateful, now disregarding the grace of education and packing her clothes to leave. Alaric interjected, mocking his mother, saying that the so-called grace of education was only for the sake of two thousand pounds a year. Mrs. Ziggister, seeing that her son had exposed her true intentions, scolded him severely.</p>
<p>Childe came in, and everyone welcomed him. He bent down to kiss Isesseil. Seeing her haggard appearance, he asked what was wrong. Ziggister grumbled, revealing Pang's dishonorable act of being in Kmios's room last night. Childe firmly refused to believe such a thing, and seeing Pang approach, he went to meet her, wanting her to deny it. Isesseil couldn't help but reveal her mother's dark secrets, saying that her mother educated Pang only for the sake of two thousand pounds a year. Pang looked at them in turn with a strange expression, realizing that their kindness towards her was all for money!</p>
<p>Pang said in a low voice that she was going home, and they would just have to forgive her for the loss of one thousand pounds. Childe now felt he could no longer hide the truth from Pang and told her that her father was still at home, and what was said before was just a lie. Pang was truly overjoyed, shocked that the only confidant she thought she had would also deceive her for money, and happy that her truly beloved father was still alive. Pang cried out that she couldn't bear it anymore and rushed out the door.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, Isesseil also felt she could no longer bear it and told Childe how her mother had coveted Pang's inheritance and did not hesitate to make her children do deceitful things. She further told him how her mother used Kress's love and how she planned to elope with him last night, and how Pang wanted to protect her. Childe's heart was in turmoil, and he left there in a daze.</p>
<p>After Pang returned home, the reunion with her family brought her the joy of family, but also a different kind of longing. Although she was dissatisfied with Childe's deceptive behavior, she could never forget him. One day, on her birthday, many friends came to the village to celebrate. She was already a young woman, how could she dismiss the feelings of longing for her lover? Her father led her to the [illegible character] and told her to close her eyes and sit and wait. At that time, the new moon was rising, and the moonlight shone on her tear-stained face. Footsteps approached her, she opened her eyes, she saw her beloved in front of her, she thought it was an illusion, closed her eyes and opened them again, it was indeed him! Childe hugged her again and said, "I love you"!</p>
