<p>（東京）　齋藤首相於與若槻會見後談曰、若槻總裁來訪、係答禮性質、並未談黨國意見、政府非樹立爲非常時根底之大國策、今次會見失其意義、但是否由本人與政民兩黨總裁三人决定國策、尙未確定、此間現有本人與國民同盟總裁安達會見之說、然余未曾考慮此事、貴族院方面似有非難政府與政友會恊定國策之聲、然此不過以五一五事件之表面的報告、加以非難而已、在此非常時局、余信以最穏健方法、掃除人心不安爲適當、故余决意在此方努力、（二十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　若槻總裁談曰、本日訪問首相、係表示答禮、因前次會見巳談過一切問題、本日未提出國策問題、今後首相或與鈴木總裁繼續會見、然兩黨總裁迭次與首相談判之事、或不致有、本人今後不必會見首相、首相方面亦似無此必要、（二十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）　貴族院公正會今晨在昭和會館開會、關於齋藤首相與政民兩黨總裁之會見問題、交換意見、因多數人之意見爲政黨對於國民之無信用、首相以舉國一致爲理由、與政黨握手、不堪遺憾、今日社會不安定之原因、在於政黨及財閥之腐敗與堕落、故不滅此根原、豈能一掃人心之不安、會議經過種種討論之結果、達到如下結論、齋藤首相之意向、似在安定政局、然現内閣應鑑於其組閣之精神、决定其國策政綱、勇往邁進、則可刷新人心、使政界復歸常道、又政黨方面、應反省自身、努力恢復國民信望、爲其急務、（二十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　齋藤首相於企圖舉國一致之意味、似有意訪問安達國同總裁、據聞並非立即訪問、而在與政友會成立恊定後、以所謂報告之意味往訪、其時并將訪問近衛貴院議長、以求諒解、又首相將與政·民·國·三黨總裁同時會見、若然則政友會謂、要求時當不拒絶、故首相與三黨首領之會見、或有實現可以能、（二十六日電通電）</p>

<h3>懲治土劣之進一步辦法·都</h3>
<p>贛省總部行營爲圖淸除匪患保障民衆之利益。計最近乃有懲治土豪劣紳條例之擬訂。俾施行於剿匪區内其重要規定。有「虐待平民致死者處死刑。致廢疾者無期徒刑。致輕微傷害者三年以上有期徒刑。」又有「侵蝕公欵千元以上者處死刑。」其所以顧藉氓庶裁抑兇頑者。固巳極盡其峻厲之能事矣。亂離變盪之世。百凡失其均衡。呑噬之念。深中人心。嚴法以　。寗云過當以吾人之憑。竊猶有嫌其未盡者。蓋一畛域之中。隨在有土劣之託迹。恃豪怙勢偃蹇自適者。祇是尋常之土劣。爲害雖深。病毒未烈。一旦以正義相加猶不難式遏其虐。若有污官墨吏與之朋比而勾結。則　成尾大不掉之勢。土劣挾貪污爲護符。貪污利土劣爲虎倀。如此交倚互策。以從事於掊克　削。幾何其不索我下民於枯魚之肆乎。然地方官吏。非盡貪污也。勾結之術。宜有時而告窮。波土劣則以善自演變之身。别爲逢迎之謀。城狐社鼠。躬埋躬搰。儘能形成一特珠勢力。與官吏相抗衡。以今日各地黨部之林立。勢難盡選良善而任之。於是此張牙舞爪之土劣。復得有　身圖利之機會矣。故明明土劣之化身。而招摇過市者。赫然稱黨部委員矣。明明武斷鄕曲之行爲。而大言炎炎中。儼然以民生主義爲口頭禪矣。各地黨治所以不能盡飫人望者。强半由此輩化裝土劣尸之咎。其間接造成之玷失。較之直接侵凌鄕愚。厥罪尤浮。吾人所以主張於懲治尋常土劣之外。更　嚴密檢舉此輩似是而非之投機份子。而痛予剔除也。</p>
<p>抑吾人又有慮者懲治土劣條例中。亦曾規定脅迫官吏與阻撓政府命令之處斷矣。此自爲針對土劣而發。吾人奚復致其疑猜。惟以匪區情形之棼亂。官民意思之隔閡官中政令常不易邀人民之諒解民間疾苦。復無法勸官廳之關切。其　通上下之情　居間斡旋之責者。端在一二淸正耆艾之士紳。彼輩遇與官吏指陳得失之際。難免以語言偏激有所開罪。而官吏中好以意氣用事者。　且濫援條例規定。　然以脅迫阻撓之罪名相加。則寃抑所在。激變可　。毫厘之差。謬以千里矣。補救之　　宜於地方别設一諮詢機關。擇邑中鉅人長德若干人組織之。以輔弼官廳之設施。以調劑政令之得失。同時復宜廣遣精明强幹之能員。隱司調察糾彈之責。則行政無偏頗之弊。而官民收浹洽之效矣。</p>
<p>自贛匪披猖。鄂警隨之。皖豫閩粤。同遭波及隠然爲國巨患。豈復跳梁可比。而遭災之區。流亡載道。鋌而走險。急何能擇。瑣尾孑遺之痛。固宜爲隠軫之士所深矜招輯安撫之道。要尤爲政府中人之亟務。軍事當局亦知剿滅非急切所能濟。而善後爲實際所難緩。故逐漸運用政治力量。以爲軍事之夾輔。此懲治土劣條例之擬定。亦即政治力量發展之一端耳。果能堅其意志。定其蘄嚮拯災黎於顚沛　厄之中。與庶民以休養生息之機。吾人敢言在剿匪策略上。必有成效可覩。非爾者。揚薪止沸。爲淵驅魚。後患之貽殆難弭戢。當事者寗可不懷爲深戒哉。</p>

<p>、㈢出口國家將於一九三四年及一九三五年减少産額百分之十五、惟蘇俄及多瑙河諸國除外、㈣當麥價達每百公斤値十二金佛郎時、進口國將考慮减低關稅、簽訂此約之結果、美農部所擬之統制小麥計劃、將爲之稍加修改、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>主席邊納特報告（倫敦）　小麥會議主席邊納特、即加拿大首相、在今日會議時聲稱、輸出國巳接受每百公斤十二金佛郎、或每布施爾金元六角三分○八之價格、以此爲可請輸入國修正其入口麥稅之標準、輸出國願有更高價格、但鑒於其他代表所發之言論、乃準備依此數字云、</p>

<p>美農部表示滿意路透社華盛頓訪電稱、美國農務局人員對此最後之决議、頗爲欣悅、但未加以批評、因須將在最近二十四小時内所增入之條文詳加分析也、華盛頓所表示之非正式意見、以爲倫敦愶定可與美國根據自動的國内支配計畫調節小麥出産之程序完全適合云、</p>
<p>恊定簽訂之本旨惟此恊定之本旨、在使輸入国或不利用輸出國减産之機會、而發展其國内政策、致妨碍輸出國現爲公共利益起見將麥價恢復至有利的價格之努力、</p>
<p>輸入國附加聲明該恊定附加輸入國聲明書一件、内言八月二十一日所成立之草恊定大綱、即輸入國依允不鼓勵麥田之增加、並採行擴充銷費之各種可能的辦法、及於麥價充分穏定時减輕關稅、此聲明書又稱、輸入國依允爲恢復世界小麥貿易中之常態起見　、關稅之减輕、必須與小麥輸入額量之减少同時俱進、此種原則必須接受云、</p>
<p>準備减低進口稅輸出國依允在一九三三至三四年内對於小麥輸入額量之修改、可作切實之進行、但輸入國準備如世界價格從一九三三年最初六個月之平均價格確實上趨、則在一九三四年至三五年内採行有効力之變更辦法、（路透電）</p>

<p>十八日上午十時、由大同登車、行九十里、過豐鎭、轉入綏遠境内、沿途山陵綿延、草原茂盛、實爲天然墾牧之地、惜因交通不便、地廣人稀、遂致貨棄於地、任其荒廢、下午三時許過卓資山、車行山中、衆山環拱、别有勝景、該山乃塞外名地、古代詞賦、頗有稱道者、大同至綏遠約五百里、至卓資山乃及其半、車行六小時許、乃抵綏遠、適値雷雨、入城小憩、</p>
<p>此次西行、途中曾與在喜峯口作戰之某高級將士同車、據談九一八事變以後、東北三省淪於敵手、宋哲元及孫殿英曾請纓出兵、收復失地、由熱河進兵、一路出朝陽、一路出開魯、會師瀋陽、當時東北民氣甚旺、縱不能一鼓而失士盡復、亦可大挫敵鋒、乃未能實現、其後日軍圖熱、宋又請纓入熱、效命前驅、宋在十四年曾任熱河都統、地理熟、以之守熱、或不至不堪收拾、乃至承德失陷、東北軍潰入長城以内、始奉命令、增防喜峯、當開拔前進時、適値東北軍後退、羣詢宋部爲何軍、前去何爲、答爲二十九軍、前往抗日、聞者咸謂敵勢兇猛、莫道二十九軍、即九十九軍亦難抵禦、宋部聞言、嗤之以鼻、急行百二十里、與敵遭禦、士卒疲敝、工事全無、奮勇血戰、雖挫敵鋒、死傷一千二百有餘、其後大軍續至、咸抱與敵决死之心、相與計議、軍器不及敵人、與其久守而受傷殘、莫若赴敵、同死疆場、乃由潘家口董家口等處衝出、殺入敵陣、士抱必死之心、一以當百、斬獲甚衆、敵胆爲寒、是役以後、敵不敢正視、幾度乘虚來襲、我軍行動敏捷、日行二百里、隨來隨應、終不得逞、相持兩月、日軍屢攻不克、發生極大疑問、第一不知宋部主力何在、用飛機偵察、僅見此處駐駐有少數部隊、及至進攻、又覺兵力雄厚、堅不可拔、主力何在、始終莫明、第二不知宋部有多少、宋部防綫甚長、乃日軍任擊何處、均有雄厚兵力相應、直非少數兵力所能辦到、遂致日軍有不知兵有多少之感、其實宋部在前綫者僅及數萬、第運用靈活耳、兵貴精而不貴多、良有以也、現在日軍常以宋部爲對象、加以研究、謂宋部軍械旣不及日軍、而後方運輸又極不便、其所以制勝之道何在、大有研討之價値云、（八月十九日達）</p>

<p>各要人聯袂來滬迎宋</p>
<h3>汪院長亦有來滬訊</h3>
<p>財政部長宋子文氏、定二十九日乘坐大來公司傑弗遜總統號輪抵滬、中央各要人、均巳準備來滬歡迎、計立法院長孫科·立法委員馬超俊·傅汝霖·華北政務整理委員會財務處長王克敏等、巳於昨晨由京抵滬、交通部長朱家驛·行政院秘書長褚民誼·衛生署長劉瑞恒·等、亦於昨晚由京來滬、鐵道部長顧孟餘·次長曾仲鳴·實業部長陳公博等、則定二十八日夜車來滬、華北政務整理委員會委員長黃郛、抗日英雄馬占山等、亦定二十八日由杭來滬、並悉行政院長汪精衛氏、亦將來滬歡迎云、</p>
<h3>孫科返滬談話</h3>
<p>馮將入京任中央要職</p>
<p>名義問題正徵馮同意</p>
<p>孫太夫人定卅日返籍</p>
<p>立法院長孫科、偕同立法委員馬超俊·傅汝霖·昨晨八時、由京乘夜車來滬、本報記者、昨特訪晤孫氏於寓次、錄其談話如次、</p>
<p>（馮可來京不願久住）孫氏首謂、在泰山會晤　　馮煥章先生、暢談甚歡　　、馮態度誠懇、並表示短期内可赴京一行、惟不願在京久住、蓋不慣都市生活也、至馮名義問題、中央擬畀以陸軍檢閱使·或水利督辦職、正徵馮同意、俟馮本人决定何職後、即正式命令發表、馬超俊傅汝霖兩氏前赴廬山晋謁蔣委員長、即係商洽此事、故本人暫時無再飛贛之必要、</p>
<p>（外交方針並無變更）至於日方盛傳我外交方針、已有轉變之動機　　等說、可於宋部長此次　　遇日不登岸之一點、不攻而自破矣、現外交雖已由汪院長兼任、然外交方針、暫時並無更動之意、至謂巳向日秘密進行八千萬借欵、不但日本無此財力、而我國前借日債尙無力償還、遑論再借、故此種傳說、實完全出於謡傳、</p>
<p>（外羅出巡鞏固邊陲）</p>
<p>外長羅文幹、此次出巡　　新疆、係羅氏本人意見　　、蓋當中央派黃慕松赴新、尙未成行時、羅氏即有此意、奈當時因華北停戰、不能分身、且汪院長當時亦以外交緊張、不可乏人主持、故不主羅氏前往、其事遂寢、最近、因外交方面巳告一段落、羅氏復作此請、中央乃勉允之藉以視察邊陲情形、鞏固國防、</p>
<p>（五全大會如期召開）</p>
<p>五全大會中央已積極　　籌備、西南反對開會、　　其理由謂、係以前議决未盡實行、今後可不必開會、此種理由、不但持論未近情理、即普通團體機關、亦不致有此膚淺之見、遑論該會係黨國最高機關者、粤委旣對於以前議决案未實行而認爲不滿、儘可趁此機會、在大會中、提出質問、若僅對中央政府過去表示不滿、則亦不妨以意見提交大會、公開討論、何用反對開會、至於粤省將另行召集大會說、實不過少數人之企圖、事實係不可能、亦有主大會不於首都舉行、而另擇一地者、殊不知此係黨綱所規定、苟非不承認南京爲首都者、則其違背黨綱也明甚云云、</p>
<p>（留滬候宋暫不赴粤）孫氏最後談稱、本人來滬、係乘星期之暇、稍作休息、並擬留滬候宋子文部長面晤後、再行返京、至外傳本人將赴粤說不確、余暫時無南下之意云、又據孫氏左右消息、孫母盧太夫人、定本月三十日返籍、由孫之公子陪同乘輪南下、</p>

<p>吳市長返滬談</p>
<h3>徵收地價稅勢在必行北四川路房捐亦必徵</h3>
<p>市長吳鐵城、日前因公晋京、謁晤行政院長汪精衛、報告本市市政最近設施情形、茲已公畢、昨晨八時、由京乘車返滬、十時三十分、在市府接見各報社記者、對於市府擬徵收地價稅、及北四川路越界地段徵收房捐等、發表如下之談話、</p>
<p>（徵地價稅）</p>
<p>吳氏首謂、此次徵收地價稅、爲經過長時間之考慮與籌劃、故勢在必行、其理由有如下各點㈠全國各地人民之稅收負擔、以上海一隅爲最輕、尤以市區市民所擔負者爲更輕、照國民對國家應有之義務言、决不能猶豫推諉者、</p>
<p>（平均負擔）</p>
<p>㈡現在市區、即就住宅區而言、南市與閘北之地價、毎畝由數千兩至十餘萬兩不等、較之吳淞·江灣·漕河涇·虹橋鎭·等鄕區之地價、每畝由二三百元至四五百元者、其相差甚遠、南市閘北之房租收入較諸吳淞·江灣·等地之田畝收穫、更不知高出幾何倍數、而過去徵之於房地與田畝者、竟不相上下、是誠不公道之極矣、</p>
<p>（富人多抽）</p>
<p>中國農村經濟、每况愈下、實　　亦農民擔負過重所致、至房　　地主所謂巳有房捐之負擔、須知房捐偏於警務方面者、總之、彼反對者儘可藉口喋喋、余敢直捷痛快言之、即抽稅應向有錢人多抽、不好向窮人去苛求、故徵收地價稅决不容展緩、且亦無展緩之可能性、市政收入、應本量出爲入、因市政建設所必須實施者、則必堅决從早實施之、蓋其性爲死的而非生的故也、俟市府籌備工作辦理完竣後、當即依法先從住宅區實行起徵、預計每年收入、可得百餘萬元、完全作爲市政建設之用、</p>
<p>（房捐必徵）</p>
<p>吳氏繼謂、北四川路越界築　　路一帶房捐、决不能再事因　　循遷就、必當依法嚴厲執行、乃該處一帶商户、竟想再求緩徵、實屬無理可喻、彼等藉口越界、欲俟交涉辦妥後、再行開徵、是更喪心病狂、彼等生爲中國人民、居在中國土地、即就租界而言、租界爲於他人之地、期滿仍爲我國領土、故其神聖之司法權、仍操我手、而有第一第二兩特區法院之設立、祗不過一部份檢察權、受相當限制耳、彼等今且非居於租界、而居於純粹中國地帶之越界、受市政若干設施之享受、豈有不負納捐義務之理、本市府當一面勸導、一面厲行徵收也、</p>
<h3>羅店全鎭昨日罷市</h3>
<p>區長禁僱專員收賑</p>
<p>商界採用消極抵抗</p>
<p>寳山縣屬羅店鎭、昨日忽然發生全鎭罷市風潮、情形分誌如下、</p>
<p>罷市原因羅店鎭爲滬太路全路第一首鎭、其四鄕鄕脚、遠至六七里、十餘里、二十里不等、故市面較諸太倉縣屬之劉河鎭爲過之、各商店等放出之帳、不惟路遠不便收取、往往有頑疲欠户、積欠至三五年或六七年、以故該鎭商店、有雇用專員、赴鄕收欵之習慣、近爲該處第四區區務會議議决、不許商店雇用烟民乞丐代索欠欵、并呈准縣府、發貼佈告禁止、各商店等以日後於出之帳欵、將無從收取、故羣起恐慌、前日下午三時許、特往該鎭商會開會、討論對付辦法、至深晚二時許、無結果而散、及至昨日、全鎭遂一律罷市、</p>
<p>罷市理由該鎭罷市後、即發出罷市理由云、查商民罷市之舉、原是一種消極抵抗辦法、否則誰肯輕舉妄動、忍痛犧牲、此次本鎭市四區區公所王慶壽區長、擅據區務會議中各鄕長之朦混提案、率爾呈請縣府、令飭遵行、事前絶無商酌、事後亦無保障、予欠債者以便利之機會、令放帳者無收取之可能、是以官廳勢力、欲壓迫商民、我商界同人、豈甘忍受、自奉到縣署訓令後、各商家對於收索帳欵上、已感受到重大之窒碍及影響、昨開大會時、恭請王區長出席、指示救濟辦法、乃仍一味敷衍、語氣中反以商家濫放帳欵、以致收取無着等語、議論半夜、一無結果、始公决此最後罷市之一着、茲全體商民所要求者列舉如下、</p>
<p>商民要求㈠區務會議所議决之議案、限止商民雇人收帳一層、應根本推翻、并請縣府收回成命、㈡各鄕鄕長數十人中、無一不拖欠各商店帳欵、屢索不還、（其中祇一二人不欠）此次該鄕長等爲自私自利起見、故贊助此議案、現應限令各該鄕長等、對於各商號欠欵、先應掃數淸償、以爲表率、否則此種頑劣鄕長、應予撤換、㈢第四區公所助理孫應豐、一孺子耳、不學無術、應請撤職、㈣區分所本身所欠各商店帳欵、歷有年所矣、從未淸還、此次亦請掃數歸還、免致逋負、以上各點、爲合鎭商民所共同要求云、</p>
<p>商會呈文羅店商會代理主席王大勳、昨日呈縣府文去、呈爲飛電呈報事、案奉鈞府訓令、據第四區區長王慶濤、呈請取締商家收帳等因奉此、正核議轉知間、忽據全鎭商民來會開會、以王區長不禁鄕民賒欠、但禁商家索欵、且誣以雇用气丐烟民、禁止登門收帳、爲疲頑欠户張目、不啻制商民於死命、應請王區長埀念商艱、撤回、原呈等語、旋由王區長聲明、當時區務會議、并不在塲、對於本案原委、未免隔膜、容俟趨晤縣長籌商轉圜等語、各商民以區長語帶含糊、未能滿意、遂即决議停業待命、不轉瞬間、全鎭告罷市矣、此案由區務會議舊案重提、致又演廿年九月十八日之惡劇、區長旣悔未明原委、屬會亦愧無法週旋、現同公安局盡力勸導、迄無效果、合亟飛報縣長鑒核、迅派妥員來羅開導、不勝惶急、謹呈寳山縣縣長金、</p>
<p>事後視察記者得悉上項情形後、復往全鎭觀察一週、見各店門首、皆粘有區務會議厭迫商民、忍痛罷市之標語、其他橋頭巷口、另有各種紅緑標語、語氣間甚爲激烈從略、各商店連飲食物店皆一列關上牌門、較廢歷元旦、尤爲冷靜、迨返滬時、又聞縣府、已派公安科長張謙受、字益之縣黨部整理委員會委員陳嘉謨、黨務委員劉守全、字璞其等、到羅調解、</p>
<h3>北四川路徵收房捐圓滿解决</h3>
<p>房捐仍自秋季起徵收</p>
<p>市府准撥救濟費一萬</p>

<p>丨黃之隨從黃永泉昨晚亦傷重殞命丨</p>
<p>市公安局督察處特務組主任黃永華、於前夜十一時許、在公共租界南京路新新大旅社五樓電梯旁、被暴徒兩人、開槍暗殺、黃氏身中兩彈、當塲殞命、黃之隨從黃永泉、亦身受重傷、詳情巳誌本報、自是案發生後、該管老閘捕房、一面將黃之屍身舁入斐倫路騐屍所候騐、一面急以電話通知公安局文局長、急派偵緝隊長盧英、及全體偵緝員、全體出動、同時老閘捕房探捕、將彈壳立交騐槍間詳加檢騐、结果、認爲與最近、暗殺前督察處特務主任馬紹武之子彈相同、足徵與馬案關係、完全相同矣、</p>
<p>（屍體相騐）昨晨由第一特區地方法院委派郭煒檢察官蒞所騐明屍體、升座公案、首據西捕頭禀明調查經過、並稱當時在出事地點拾獲子彈三只、彈壳四只等語、又據公安局督察員王文俊投稱、現死者家屬均在原籍、故文局長派余前來、代爲領屍云云、郭君得供、遂諭騐得死者黃永華委係生前被槍傷腹部身死、子彈三粒、彈壳四只、暫交捕房槍照間查騐、在逃兇犯、由捕房嚴緝獲案究辦、屍交公安局代表王文俊具結領回棺殮、</p>
<p>（迭任要職）記者昨晤及黃之至友、現任公安局職員某君、據談、黃眞正原籍、爲江北如臯人、因對外有特殊關係、故僞稱紹興人、聞黃永華尙非其眞名也、前確一度加入共黨、且於黨中具有特殊勢力、當在原籍時、曾與如臯縣黨部數度發生糾紛、當時黃氏遂毅然改轍、歸順中央、乃一變而爲中國國民黨忠實同志矣、嗣後歷任國民革命軍第三十一軍二十八師政治訓練部主任、中央黨部訓練部幹事、總司令部武漢行營軍法處審判官、陸軍第十二師黨務特派員、中央黨部組織、幹事、等要職去年九月二十六日、又經中央委　爲海員特别黨部籌備委員、至去歲十一月九日、始任市公安局督察處特務組主任職、前次被剌之馬紹武氏、蓋即黃之助手也、</p>
<p>（平素防範）期年以來、凡本埠所破獲之反動機關、泰半爲黃氏所經辦、故共黨方面、啣　剌骨、而黃亦自知處境危險、故黃之寓所、雖在華界、但除一二直接長官外、其他即至親友好、任何人均不得而知、即偶遇要事發生、亦僅用電話轉達、可見其平日防範之一斑、黃於本月二十日、因要務晚事赴京、方於前晨七時半乘夜快車抵滬、當時即乘自備之第八○八五號（華界二二八九號）汽車、直接駛歸寓所、因黃之夫人周蘭珍往杭州西湖　社養疴、故略留片刻即又復出、</p>
<p>（匪徒計劃）至入晚十時許、始往新新旅社五樓六一八號房間、踐友人約、初不料匪徒早已預伏、致遭慘變、但事後據新新旅社茶役云、前日（二十二日）下午二時許、該旅社忽來一口操皖音、身御元色綢衫、年約三十左右之男客一名、開五樓五一九號房間、署名高姓、旣而又來藍布短裝者二人、閉門密談甚久、行動甚爲詭秘、且從未呼喚茶役進房、翌日又更換至南五樓六三八號、又有穿灰色長衫及白綢長衫者三人來訪、密談甚久始去、迨黃之慘案發生後、而此不速客即一去不復返矣、</p>
<p>（中央悼惜）至於兇手行刺之手續、非常週密、蓋黃氏自馬紹武遇難後、、即日夜提心吊膽、處處提防、黃氏每至一地、必先將自衛手槍預執手中、再加視察一週、然後上車或下車、詎竟爲匪徒預先偵悉明晰、而於人夢想不到之高達五層樓之電梯旁、開槍行刺、可見其事先具有精密計劃之一斑矣、中央聞黃氏惡耗異常悼惜、屍身已在中國殯儀館收殮、喪費須一千餘元、悉由文局長代爲墊付、</p>
<p>（隨從殞命）並稱黃氏除髮妻周氏外、尙有古稀之老母、五齡女公子一名、身後甚爲蕭條云、再黃之隨從黃永泉自送入仁濟醫院後、因子彈洞穿胸部要害、雖經醫師竭力施救、卒因肺臟受創過重流血太多、延至昨晚九時殞命、當由院通知捕房、將屍舁入斐倫路騐屍所候騐、</p>

<h3>打架的象徵</h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>記得小時候看見了一回極平常的打架。一個賣水菓的小街頭販子、正在求售，來了一個滿臉橫肉的漢子，向小販子買水菓。小販子討價後，那漢子只還了一半；小販子不肯賣，那漢子硬要他賣，没說到幾句話，那漢子突然大怒，把揀好的幾個水菓摔在街心。小販子倒。有發怒。只要求給錢；漢子更赤紅了臉，一脚把水菓籃子踼翻，裏面的水菓都滾了出來；小販</p>
<p>子却不依了扭住了漢子，大吵大嚷，頓時團　了許多人瞧熱閙。可是那漢子筋强力壯，小販子是個骨瘦如柴的人、實在不是對手，經不起那漢子一陣拳打脚踼，早已把小販子也和籃子裏水菓一樣地踢翻在地了。忽然旁邊有個人不服氣、走上去抓住漢子，問他爲什麽恃强打人？一言不合，兩下對打起來。這個人的膂力，和漢子差不多，正是棋逢敵手，將遇良材，打得難解難分。小販子已由地上爬起，先還是滿臉涙容；後來他見兩人打得不可開交。痴立在那裏作壁上觀，像是很有趣味似的，竟看得呆了，忘了這一塲架是由自身而起，並忘了滾在地上的水菓和那個籃子。等到打完人散，水菓已被人踏爛了，籃子也踏扁了。</p>
<p>這一幕，倒象徵着粤海九小島被法國佔領案。我國外交部只在最初消息傳來時說過幾聲抗議；後來日本一出頭，竟佔了事實抗議的先着，我國倒改取靜觀態度了。於是近半月來各報所有關於此案的記載、幾全是巴黎東京兩方的辯爭；我國則除了民間團體要求外部力爭的電文點綴各報外，别的是什麽聲息也没有了。</p>
<p>靜觀的結果，大概也必不出於水菓踏爛，籃子踏扁的先例。路透電社已經告訴過我們了：巴黎官塲對日代辦宣言，多守緘默，以免事件擴大；惟法政府或將允許尊重日本之經濟利益、而拒絶日本有政治主權之要求。自然，遇到膂力差不多的對手。總没有骨瘦如柴的對手那樣容易踼翻的啊。</p>
<p>漫話漫畫</p>
<h3>願作富家犬，毋爲人子？</h3>
<p>— 錢澐作文楝良作畫</p>
<p>楊家的孩子，爲了爸爸不會賺錢、連帶受苦，没有讀書識字更不必說，因爲在中國失學的孩子，也不知多少，然而肚子餓，乃每天幾回的事自也每天不能不解决的事，餓到甚至小眼涙直淌，可是爸爸還說無辦法！有時竟把他駡一頓，有時則又抱着一同大哭，祇是孩子哭時，眼睛成了縫，爸爸哭時，張目如銅鈴！</p>
<p>說來信不信由你</p>
<p>，柳家那條洋狗，得了主人歡心，養在家裏不單每天專供一塊錢牛肉，有一次病了一月光景請位著名獸醫，每天診治調理之後，醫藥結算，或由太著名之故，竟費了二千五百餘兩，眼界小的朋友，不避嫌問他何以肯化這些錢在一條的狗身上？答說：没有别的，因它「伶俐之至」而已：在富家用此原不成問題，何况柳家整千萬的善舉也未必不做，祇是與楊家的孩子比較，却還是一個絶妙妙對照。</p>
<p>從這樣看，可以發表一句，是駡人「狗」，似乎不是專屬侮辱名詞的。</p>
<h3>大腿底下</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>時代是不斷地的前進着，我們的密史，由石榴裙而長旗袍，而赤裸裸的大腿。</p>
<p>這大腿光光的皮膚；灣灣的曲線；踏在高跟鞋上；微露在長旗袍的下蓋中，多麽的魅惑丨多麽的肉感！任你是柳下惠；任你是魯男子，便是三家邨裏吃冷肉的老道學；過去皇宫中的老太監，也得乘便瞟伊幾下。不瞟伊猶可，瞟了而不心蕩神馳者，我未之聞也。</p>
<p>大腿既有這樣的魅力，任何影片中，有了幾雙肥壯白嫩的大腿，攝入了鏡頭，纔賣得起座位；纔配人的胃兒。跳舞團裏的角兒，玉腿肯公開地裸着，纔能呌人消魂盪魄，涎埀三尺。時代的女性，長旗袍底下裸着雙腿，纔夠得上摩登的條件。大腿！裸着的大腿！伊是二十世紀的驕子。幾多人爲了伊顚倒，禮讚，追求，甚至於犧牲一切。而大腿底下的收穫，金錢，珠鑽，衣飾，其他的一切。還有無數的癩蝦蟆，瞪着眼；鼓着腹，膜拜在大腿底下。大腿之力大矣哉！大千衆生，那個不合十誦讚曰：大哉！大哉！</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>一樣的大腿，兩樣的價値。鄕下人腿。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>一樣的大腿，兩樣的愛憎。那粉裝玉琢的大腿；也是消耗分利的大退，偏有人追求着，崇拜着。那滿塗泥水的大腿；也是生産有力的大腿，倒厭惡他；輕視他。咳！這也是時代之謎！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十四回授室多艱徘徊憂後顧邀朋小聚靦覥記前塵</p>
<p>江氏道：表兄，你旣然有事，就不忙在今日一天，暫時你就回營去，改天咱們再談罷。關耀武站了起來笑道！老實說，我只要大姨有一句話，我責任也就算盡了，至於今天談，改天談，我倒是不拘。說畢，他笑嘻嘻的向後院趙家去了。趙翁把這兩天的情形，略微對關耀武說了一說，越見得這事是十有八九可以成功了。他帶了充量的歡喜，趕着就回營去到了連部，自己剛進屋子，趙自强就跟着走進來了，笑道：大哥，事情怎麽樣，大概是没有什麽問題的了吧？關耀武將頭上的軍帽，緩緩的取了下來，各小桌子上放着，望了趙自强，却只管出神，臉上可帶着一些微笑。趙自强道：　你笑什麽，無非是娶媳婦養兒子，誰不是那一套？這也没有什麽可笑的。關耀武笑道：我不是笑别的，我笑你大年三十夜做八十歲，趕上這麽一趟熱閙。什麽時候不好說媳婦，偏偏趕上這檢閱大典的日子。又顧公事又顧私事。我這次爲了白被單不夠，墊了一筆錢買。這又要虧空一下子。檢閱檢閱。閙的人過不得。你還有那功夫想媳婦。趙自强道：趕上了這日子，有什麽法子呢？我想咱們這一營，也是缺額太多，要不然，學他們第一營的辦法，隔連借人，那是最好的辦法。一連差三十個人的話，報上十個八個勤務，再借二十名人抵數，神不知鬼不覺的就混了過去，咱們臨時補的這些新弟兄，敎練得累死人。關耀武歎了一口氣道：這些委員老爺，只瞧個外表，這有什麽法子。（一七○）</p>
<p>兒童的樂園</p>
<h3>消夏會</h3>
<p>— 顔</p>
<p>西山呑没了落日，柳梢掛上了素月，同時暑氣也爲紅日帶去，凉風也隨素月以俱來，小兒女們也都飯餘浴罷來到衖堂裏乘凉嬉遊了。因爲每晚相見，所以大家親熱得如親兄北，親姊妹，你搭我肩，我携你手，同唱同舞，同吹口琴，同捉迷藏，往往到夜深人靜，還樂而忘倦，要他們的媽媽姊妹來一個個捉回去　　一天晚上，正是月明之夜，他們跳躍言笑了一回兒，秀梅集衆人提議道：我們天天那樣玩，也覺有些乏味了，今夜我想來換個方法，開一消夏會，不知大家贊成不贊成，秋霞第一個嚷着道：贊成！舉手！又說：這個會究怎樣開？秀梅便又說：我們來各人唱唱講講，惟必須含有冷的意義，使大衆聽了，不也一樣足以生凉嗎？大家歡然道：眞有趣！快來！快來！</p>
<p>秀梅是發起人，被推先來，伊巳是初中，年生了，盈盈地起立道：諸位小朋友！昨天我到東北去，長白山那裏遍地白雪皚皚。寒風呼呼，眞冷得鼻子也要掉下來，我在風雪　途中縮手縮頸地向北走去，到松花江畔，見闊大的河而，變成，條坦蕩的馬路，原來已結成厚厚的冰了。上面長途汽車，往來奔馳，我覺得奇異，便也走上去，那知一失足，跌了一交，張開眼來。躺在牀上，原來是夢呵，大家都說：冷啊！冷啊！好冷的東北啊！</p>
<p>第二個輪到小高麗，他是高麗人，所以大家給他起了這個綽號。他頑皮地唱道：「寒風習習，冷雨凄凄。」唱得淸脆宛轉，　並且大有寒意，大家拍手道：寒衣曲唱得好！快唱下去！他却嬉皮笑臉說道：下面不冷，我也不唱了，於是大家都說，小高麗，壞來些。</p>
<p>「積雪没脛，堅冰在鬚，鷙鳥休巢，征馬踟躇，僧纊無温，　指裂膚，」春官他是讀過弔古戰塲文的，所以就背出上面的幾句。有人嚷着不懂，秀梅便起立解釋給他們聽，大家都說：這樣的打仗，眞冷死人了！</p>
<p>雪貞起立說：去年冬天，在外面弄了一塊冰回去，到家就打碎在地上，小弟弟看見滿地冰糖，搶着就吃，那知到嘴裏，張開嘴就哭，我却大笑，大家笑道：冷死了，貪吃的報應。</p>
<p>小毛早就要講，現在輪着了，跳起來道：六月裏凍死人，你們聽見過嗎？大家道：休瞎說！他道：誰瞎說，先生講給我們聽的，淸朝有個薛福成，皇帝派他外國去考察，回來時到廣東　，正是六月天氣，熱得不了，廣東的官員，因爲他是欽差大臣，極力招待他，特築一冰室給他居住，那知過於冷了，就此得了病死了，所以大家說薛福成是六月裏凍死的，小朋友們不約而同地說：希奇希奇！有趣有趣！</p>
<p>新囡祇讀一年級，伊也起立道：「雪花飛，狗歡喜」，大家笑道：新囡也歡喜。</p>
<p>阿福他是在衖口小書攤上看慣閒書的，輪到了他，便脫口唱道：「十二月裏來雪花飛，孟姜女出外送寒衣，」他唱到這裏，自己倒先衆人而笑了，</p>
<p>最第輪到鍚良了，不知他在何時弄來一把白的紙屑，他起立先作驚惶色道：外面在下雪了！大家果然向衖堂外張望，他乘此便把一握碎紙向上一撒，一面嚷道：好大的雪啊！紙屑片片落下，大家眞個認爲下雪，搶了矮凳向家裏奔，他見大家逃，就哈哈大笑，原來大家聽了許多冷唱與講，心理上都已起了變化，所以一見白片自上而下，才認爲眞的下雪了。</p>
<p>秀梅說：時間不早了，人家都家去了，我們也當睡去，明天相見罷！於是大家歡然歸去，頓時衖中寂然，惟有明月依然朗照着，淸風依然輕拂着。</p>
<h3>七夕新開篇</h3>
<p>— 張夢飛</p>
<p>七月七日是今朝。織女牛郎會鵲橋。</p>
<p>森森銀河滿月色。風平浪靜少波濤。二人晤面多情話。秋凉天氣樂逍遙。織女呀。今歲欣逢國貨年。你衣裳國貨確時髦。挽回權利卿提倡。欽佩我妻是愛國的女同胞。凸胸露腿摩登化。比若當年分外嬌。想一别經年今日會。一年一度是今宵。牛郎呀。國家多事難尋趣。中華未免太糟糕。東北風雲今雖息。堪憐四省已飄搖。待明年再自訂桃夭。啊喲織女呀。今宵祗可談風月。何須國事話嘮叨。此刻牛郎要抱柳腰。（此開篇准今日下午四時半至五時半假座恒森電台親自彈唱佈送。電波一四二零）</p>

<h3>羅泊杯初賽英國淘汰美國</h3>
<p>結果直落三</p>
<p>丨中葡星期三比賽丨</p>
<p>羅泊杯國際雙打比賽、昨日英國對美國舉行初賽、结果英國史篤克與柯而巧淘汰美國史規亞與史密斯、比數爲六比二、六比二、六比三又中華對葡萄牙、原定昨日比賽、因與扶輪杯衝突而改期、期、現兩方决定於本星期三下午在中華網球塲舉行、中華選手、初定邱飛海與鄭兆佳、但近有改邱對江道章配搭之說、</p>
<h3>扶輪杯上海萬國網球中華仍能保持錦標</h3>
<p>昨日雙打中華直落三勝葡</p>
<p>柯拉沙以三比一勝王文正</p>
<p>今日鄭兆佳劇戰柯拉沙</p>
<p>王文正出戰遜那能獲勝</p>
<p>王文正昨抱破釜沉舟之志、冀以一鼓作氣、制服柯拉沙、但其猛銳之抽球、均被柯拉沙擊破、於是王計不得逞、卒歸敗北、柯以九比七勝第四盤、合計隔日之戰績、柯以六比三、六比四、零比六、九比七勝、</p>
<p>昨爲羅伯杯上海萬國網球賽之第二日、除柯王因第一日單打因天黒未終、於昨日續賽外、正塲比賽爲雙打、二塲比賽、均甚重要、而以柯拉沙與王文正之勝負誰屬、尤爲觀衆所關心、故昨日中華網球塲上、觀者愈形踴躍、雖火傘高張、均不之畏、</p>
<p>雙打比賽、中華仍由老搭擋鄭兆佳與余田光合組、葡萄牙之陣線、亦仍由Ｓ柯拉沙與考司坦出塲、開塲葡選手格露鋒芒、加以鄭兆佳手勢不順、頻頻失分、而余田光網前工佳殊佳、抽擊亦甚竣急、大受觀衆讚美、葡以四比二佔先、入後鄭逐漸恢復原狀、卒以六比四反敗爲勝第二第三兩盤、余田光依舊驕健、不稍减色、鄭兆佳手勢漸熟、銳芒漸露、其發球最受人稱賞、二人合作純熟、守網堅固、連破三盤而勝　、比數爲六比四、六比三、六比二、</p>
<p>中華雙打選手鄭兆佳（右）余田光（左）</p>
<p>（啟昌攝）</p>
<p>今日爲最後兩組單打比賽、中華保持錦標、全無問題、王文正雖失一單打與柯拉沙　但可穏勝遜那、昨日雙打旣爲中華勝利、則中華已穏取三組、葡萄牙希望全消、惟今日鄭兆佳與柯拉沙之比賽、勝敗得失、雖不影響錦標、但二人之表演、殊足令人注意、柯拉沙於初賽中、曾敗上海埠際選手日本町田、又以三比一勝王文正、高級單打、初賽、柯又曾勝梁德光、比數爲三比二盤、而鄭兆佳曾勝梁德光於優游盃賽中、而敗於王文正於中華公開單打决賽、以此戰績推論、柯與鄭、猶不知鹿死誰手、但以擊法方面而論、鄭兆佳似可以勝柯拉沙、畢竟如何、觀者拭目以待可耳、</p>
<h3>柯拉沙竟然得勝</h3>
<p>（王文正智窮計竭）王與柯因隔日未能結束、比數爲三比六、四比六、六比○、六比六、昨日下午三時半續繼比賽、王爲愼重起見、特先行到塲、與人練習、藉以活動手腕、以壯聲勢、原來之裁判員爲卜德、因事未能到塲、由江道章疱代、巡邊員亦換兩人、開賽後、王施以閃電般之抽擊、攻破柯拉沙之發球局、觀者爲之一喜、不料王之發球局、竟輕易失去、而成七比七、柯拉沙謹愼從事、以滑四取得危急但事與願違、一記二記、柯拉沙卒勝此局此盤、此比賽、當比賽時、過王之出界球、固有巡邊員在呌喊、但柯拉沙亦同時發出「出界」之聲殊非應當、</p>
<h3>雙打賽中華奪回</h3>
<p>（余田光特别討好）葡萄牙自柯拉沙勝、單打後、頗想染指錦標、蓋葡如勝雙打、再希望柯拉沙能勝鄭兆佳、此未嘗無冠軍希望也、然柯拉沙能否勝鄭兆佳、需屬疑問、其雙打組、究非第一流角色、故其希望、直等於夢想耳、開始後、因鄭兆佳之頻頻失分、被葡選手先聲奪人、以三比一及四比二佔先、但往後卒被鄭余擊破、連取三盤、是塲表演、余田光特别討好、網前功夫甚佳　、不論高壓低攔、極有把握、球時向對方之反手方向進襲、每奏奇效、博得觀者大爲讚美、而鄭兆佳則庸庸碌碌、第一盤之失分更分、第二盤至第三盤、鄭逐漸復原狀、其發球重如砲彈、攔網亦有分寸、且每以竣急如矢之球、向邊界射進、受觀衆之稱崇不已、然鄭余二人、均擅反手抽擊、正手反多失誤、亦一奇事、</p>
<p>（直落三寫寫意意）葡選手先聲奪人、柯拉沙取得發球局、鄭兆佳亦得發球局、葡又連加兩局、成三比一、繼成四比二、葡選手聲勢汹汹、觀者爲之驚嘆、然觀其表演技術、絶難得最後勝利者、是以下四局均被鄭余連勝、反以六比四終、第二盤考司坦勝發球局後、鄭余連加三局、往後各以發球局得勝、乃成五比三、中華組再破考司坦之發球局、再以六比三勝盤、第三盤爲鄭余之全盛意代、柯拉沙僅取得其兩次之發球局、餘均屬中華勝利、中華遂再以六比二勝、</p>
<h3>今日單打有劇戰</h3>
<p>（鄭與柯必有劇戰）今日爲扶輪杯本年結束之一日、中葡最後兩組單打、於下午四時同在中華網球塲舉行、王文正之勝遜那毫無問題、鄭兆佳對柯拉沙之比賽、必有精彩劇烈之竸爭、殊可注意、勝負誰屬、猶其餘事也、比賽畢、由扶輪杯主人扶輪社副會長朱　泉氏、當場給獎、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>雜談七月</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>陰歷的七月天，實在是一年中最好的時候，所謂「巳凉天氣天寒時」也，因而民間對於七月的傳說，故事之類，也特别的多。詩人善感，對於秋風的慘澹，會發生感慨，原是當然：至於一般無敏銳感受性的平民，對於七月，也會得這樣謳歌頌揚的原因，想來總不外乎農忙巳過，天氣淸凉，自己可以安穏來享受自己的勞働結果的緣故：雖然在水旱成災，豐收也成災，農村破産的現代中國，農民對於秋的感覺如何，許還是一個問題。</p>
<p>七月裏的民間傳說最有詩味的，當然是七夕的牛郎織女的事情。小泉八雲有一册銀河故事，所記的，是日本鄕間，於七夕晚上，懸五色詩箋於竹竿，擲付淸溪　，使水流去的雅人雅事，中間還譯了好幾首日本的古歌在那裏。</p>
<p>其次是七月十五的盂蘭盆會；這典故的出處，大約是起因於盂蘭盆經的目蓮救母的故事，不過後來愈弄愈巧，便有刻木割竹，飴蠟剪彩，模花葉之形狀等妙技了。日本鄕間，在七月十五的晚上，并且有男女野舞，直舞到天明的習俗，名曰盆踊。鄙人在日光，鹽原等處，曾有幾次躬逢其盛，覺得那一種農民的原始的跳舞，與目下的鄕村男女酣歌戲謔的情調，實在是有些寫不出來的愉快的地方。這些日本的七月裏的遺俗　，不知道是不是我們隋唐時代的國産，這一點，倒很想向考據家們請敎一番。</p>
<p>因目蓮救母的故事而來的點綴，還有七月三十日的放河燈與插地藏香等閙事。從前寄寓在北平什刹海的北岸，第到秋天，走過積水潭的凈業庵頭，就要想起王次回的「秋夜河燈凈業庵」那一首絶句。聽說紹興有大規模的目蓮戲班和目蓮戲本，不知道這目蓮戲在紹興，是不是也是農民在七月裏的業餘餘興？</p>
<h3>南口的蘋果</h3>
<p>— 李條</p>
<p>南口不單産蘋菓，如杏子葡萄花紅桃子等等都出産得很多。不過我發願在南口玩一天的時候，剛好是蘋菓正熟的節候。</p>
<p>火車一停下來，月台外的呌賣聲便駡人似的刺入耳來。我不懂北方人爲什麽這麽情極，連呌賣也這麽　喝地，大有威脅人非買他的東西不可之勢。有的把貨灘擺在木柵外邊，自己攀着木柵向火車中的坐客　喝：有的一手攀着木柵，兩脚踏在木柵的横擋上，身體向裏俯，另一手把貨物平伸着，以求接近從火車上下來的主顧。他的意思是近水樓台先得月，主顧一定先照顧他的生意的。然而他這番好意往往不被接受，車上下來的顧客，每每微睨他一眼，跑向柵外的灘上去講價錢。於是，他只好直着喉嚨。擺動平舉着貨物的手向第二個客人兜攬。</p>
<p>所謂貨物，除掉間成有之的熟雞，豆漿，米粥，包子之外，大部都是水菓；而我所要說的是蘋菓。一離開北平往西，景物便都現得焦黄的，但南口却有圓圓的水紅色的像十六歲小姑娘的嬌頰似的蘋菓，滿筐滿簍地陳列着，實在有說不出的艶麗。</p>
<p>水菓是南口的名産，這地方一年三季有時菓上市，又新鮮又便宜。蘋菓開價三毛錢一大簍，二毛錢一小簍，不會買的大簍還價二毛錢，會買的一毛半也就成交了；還有精明的老門檻他寗可論斤，論斤價錢差不多，而可免有爛的或較差的充在底裏之弊。一大簍約莫有十一二斤，十六兩稱。</p>
<p>水菓一離南口就貴，大概因水菓離開産地，便漸漸不新鮮，所以値錢了。說起來呢，南口有平綏路通到北平，火車一小時可達，但火車要調軍用，客車常常誤點三四小時，貨車因候兵車拖還，才有車頭來拉，普通可以誤點一天到二天；路上還要避讓兵車，車頭還得去拉兵車，什麽時候可以從南口運到北平，就不得而知了。</p>
<p>南口四面皆山，山中菓樹叢生，花開菓熟，景色優美。南口還有今戰塲，堡壘依然，彈痕猶在。還有寨門汀土建築的陣亡將士紀念塔，矗立道右：這樣的紀念搭在中國很多丨革命的，烈士的，討△的，討Ｘ的丨以後還有很多可以建築起來。我參觀了以後，覺得别處的紀念塔還有比這個造得更好的。</p>
<p>兵車很多，蘋菓很便宜；西開的兵是爲打「假抗日的」去的，是很好的。兵車越多，蘋菓越便宜，於路過的人是很有益的。</p>
<p>現在那邊没有事了，兵車將開回來了！大概蘋菓仍舊是便宜的。</p>
<h3>「滿意」和「寫不出」</h3>
<p>— 孫用</p>
<p>對於一切都滿意的人，寫不出文章來，是當然的。所以，創作正是苦悶的象徵。</p>
<p>不過在現在的中國，對於這樣的生活，在所謂「文人」的口裏，居然能夠說出「是滿意極了」的話，倒是可以奇怪的事情。</p>
<p>然而無知無識的公子哥兒却在小報上說道：「我是一個對於生活極滿意的人，我覺得人到世界上來的確是來享福而不是來受罪的┆┆」自然啦，仰仗祖宗的遺産和老婆的妝奩而享福着的公子哥兒還有什麽不滿呢？然而他可曾想到：在中國，最大多數的人却的確是來受罪而不是來享福的？有些靑年雖也可以自誇是「眞正漂亮」的小白臉，但上海灘上没有許多宰相家的女兒拿着幾十萬的嫁妝在等着人家去勾引，那也是很明白的事情啊！</p>
<p>公子哥兒又說道：「我覺得吃苦也是一種特權，出是一種天意。爲什麽我吃得到的苦，你吃不到呢？┆┆要我吃苦我便吃，我並不想表示什麽不滿，」這其實是不値得「寫出來」的，因爲第一使我記起了一張諷剌畫：一個資本家對幾個工人演說，他的演說辭是。「上帝說，人類到世界上來，並不只爲了麵包。」（大意）。第二，我又想着了不必破壞，無須改造，以現狀爲最最好的，惰性的　弟德主義。</p>
<p>我再看他所以滿意的原因。據他自己說，他旣不是「經濟尙寛裕」，又不是「根本没有吃過苦」，却是因了「對得起自己」和「忠實於自己」之故。所謂「對得起自己」和「忠實於自己」，換一句大衆的話，就呌做「自私自利」，「自私自利」，當然寫不出「預言家」的詩。而且在現在的中國，對於這樣的生活，稍具人心，也便不能只顧自己的。</p>
<p>然而，公子哥兒的口號是：</p>
<p>生活之滿意，我寫不出；</p>
<p>享福的世界，我寫不出；</p>
<p>人生之一樂，我寫不出；</p>
<p>有許多文章；我寫不出。</p>
<p>寫不出，那就不必來獻醜罷，還是去幹那老行當，去調脂弄粉，做些似通非通，吟風弄風的歪詩，竊取「詩人」的名號自娱罷！</p>
<h3>山居雜話（續）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>㈢答應文章</p>
<p>在明仁和姜南蓉塘「半野村人閒談」裏，看到「答應文章」這標題，覺得很是歡喜。這是說王忠毅公驥的事。文云：　　王忠毅公驥，豐功偉烈，卓乎一世。凡有求詩文者，信筆成篇，略不經意。嘗謂人云：「北方老實文字不足爲法，答應而巳，連稿附之。」此可見公之眞誠。然公之可傳亦不待此也。</p>
<p>「答應而巳，」這句話說得絸是痛快淋漓。古來能文的，在他們的集子裏，總不免有這樣「答應而巳」的文章，有時還很多，文人的一部份，如鄭板橋者一流，也曾破口大駡過，然而，有什麽効果呢？文人依舊要寫「答應而巳」的文章。這樣的文章，現在是不稱「答應而已」了，最一般呌做「打鬼，」「打鬼文章，」或者文雅一點，說是「應酬之作，」「敷衍其事。」文學已經革命，文言成爲語體，但這種「敷衍之作，」變相的「答應而已」的文章，是一貫的存在着的。賢明如聖人胡適，反對做這種文章的一人到而今，也儘未能免此，遑論其他？這種「答應而已」的文章，現在不僅存在而且是發展着。發展到號稱文士的人，做「答應而巳」的文章來殺人，來歌功頌德，來洩私憤。是可說在無聊的應酬朋友的「答應而巳」的文章之外，現在是增加了一個新的體系！「吸血文章」了。吸血云乎哉，無恥而巳矣！（完）</p>
<h3>女人（三）</h3>
<p>— 沈從文</p>
<p>病人聽到這種詢問，似乎從這種詢問上引起了些另一時另一事不愉快的印象，反問女人：「你什麽時候動身？」</p>
<p>女人不卽回答，抬起頭把一雙水旺旺的眼睛望着病人，望了一會，無力的垂下去，輕輕的透了一口氣，自言自語的說：「什麽時候動身？」</p>
<p>病人明白那是什麽原因，就說：</p>
<p>「不走也好！ＸＸ的八月，無處景物不美。並且你不是說等我好了，出了院，就陪我過Ｘ」</p>
<p>Ｘ去住半個月嗎？那邊山上樹葉極美，我歡喜那些樹木。你若走了，我一個人可不想到那邊去。你爲什麽要走？」</p>
<p>女的把頭低着，帶着傷感氣分說：「我爲什麽要走？我眞不知道」！</p>
<p>病人說：</p>
<p>「我想起你一首詩來了。那首名爲季蕤之謎的詩，我記得你那麽┆┆「」若說下去，他不知道應當說得是「寂寞」還是「多情善感，」於是他換了口氣向女人說：「外邊一定很冷了，你怎麽」</p>
<p>不穿紫衣？」</p>
<p>女人裝作不曾聽到這句話，無力地扭著自己那兩隻手套，到後又問，「你出了院，預備上山不預備上山？」</p>
<p>病人似乎想起了這一個月來病中的一切，心中柔和了，悄然說道：「你不走，你同我上山，不很好麽？你又一定要走。」</p>
<p>「我一定要走，是的，我要走」。</p>
<p>「我要你陪我！」</p>
<p>「你并不要我陪你！」</p>
<p>「但你知道，┆┆」</p>
<p>「但你······」</p>
<p>什麽話也不必說了，兩人皆爲一件事音啞了。</p>
<p>她愛他，他明白的，他不愛她，她也明白的。問題就在這裏，三年來各人的地位還依然如故，并不改變多少。</p>
<p>他們年齡相差約七歲。這片時間隔着了這兩個人的友誼，使他們不能不停頓到某一層薄幕前面。兩人皆互相望着另外一個心上的脈絡，却常常黯然無聲的呆着，無從把那個人的臂膊張開，讓另一個無力地任性地臥到那一個臂膊裏去。</p>
<p>（夏天，熱人悶人倦人的夏天。）</p>
<p>三年前，南國ＸＸ暑期海濱學術演講會上，聚集五十個年靑女人，七十個年靑男子，用帳幕在海邊經營暑期生活。這些年靑男女皆從各大學而來，上午齊集在林蔭裡與臨時搭蓋的蓆棚裡聽北平來的名敎授講學，下午則過海邊浴塲作海水浴，到了晚上，則自由演劇，入映電影，以及小組談話會，跳舞會，同時分頭舉行。海邊沙上與小山頭，且常燃有火炬，焚燒柴堆，作爲海上蕩舟人與入山迷失歸途的人指示營幕所在地。</p>
<p>女子中有個傑出的人物。ＸＸ總長庶出的女兒，ＸＸ大學三年級學生。這女子旣品學粹美，像貎尤其艶麗。游泳，騎馬，划船，擊球，無不精通超人一等。且爲人旣活潑異常。又無輕狂佻野習氣。待人接物，温柔親切，故爲全個團體所傾心。其中尤以一個靑年敎授，一個中年敎授，兩人異常崇拜這個女子。但在當時，這女孩子對於一切慇懃，似乎皆不甚措意。儼然這人自覺應永遠爲衆人所傾心，永遠屬於衆人，不能儘一人所獨佔，故個人仍獨來獨往，不曾被任何愛情所軟化。</p>

<h3>美全國復興運動的前途</h3>
<p>— 蕭承怡女士</p>
<p>一九三三年的經濟恐慌狂潮，襲擊了各帝國主義國家及其殖民地，連所謂「金元帝國」的亞美利加，也同樣的被捲入了漩渦。在本年二月羅斯福總統就職後的幾天，就爆發了萬分嚴重的銀行休假的金融風潮，非但波及了全美四十八洲，而且影響牽連到全世界。全美工商業因受此影響致現金週轉不靈而停頓倒閉者幾不可計數，連帶着更增加失業恐慌的嚴重，而無由解决。同時因農産物價格的跌落而釀成的農業恐慌，更相互影響着金融恐慌而益徵深刻化。</p>
<p>在金融風潮爆發之後，羅斯福總統就採取了緊急處置，頒佈了各項强制法令，以非常的手腕暫時遏止了這强大的金融風潮，接着就施行所謂「全國復興運動」，以翼恢復一九二七年資本主義黃金時代的繁榮。但這究意能不能成功呢？我們且先看他怎樣來做這個「復興運動」，然後再來論定他的成敗吧。</p>
<p>「復興運動」的主要一項是大興土木工程，以翼减少並遏止失業增加。計劃中除另覓新礦開掘並造林外，更將「海縮」所許可的巨量噸位數十艘戰艦，立即開始製造，以刺激生産工業。據說，這「復興運動」的實施可以使五十萬工人獲得職業，然而，僅這樣已可窺見所謂「全國復興運動」的空虚了。美國現在有一千二百萬失業工人，而此「復興運動」大興土木的结果，僅得使五十萬工人獲得職業，以不算是杯水車薪嗎？功效雖不等於零，而亦右以概見了。尤其是大興土木工程的大部份是屬於造艦，由此更可知所謂「復興運動」，其根本止的並不在乎「復興」，而是鑒於日本向中國進攻的急切，中國門户開放政策的均勢不能維持，而爲日本所獨佔；同時因國際風雲的日益緊急，資本主義没落期殖民地再分割的世界大戰有旦夕爆發的可能，不得不極力擴充軍備而投擲了一顆所謂「全國復興運動」的烟幕彈來掩蔽掩蔽吧。</p>
<p>現在即使我們退一步，承認「全國復興運動」的目的是爲了「復興」，但是進行的成績怎樣呢？本月十七號的申報路透電是這樣的載着。「全國復興運動現已入第二階段，政府所遇困難亦愈甚，如油，鐵，鋼，煤等實業對工時工資規程爭執不已，┆┆羅斯福總統現積極努力欲藉最高復興行政會調解爭持不下之力量┆┆行政會討論各種辦法，内有一條，擬令近已出校之男女學童復入學校、俾减輕失業之嚴重情勢。┆」但是關於工時工資規程的爭執，維護資方呢？</p>
<p>還是袒護勞方呢？爲了貨幣的跌價和物價的抬高，工人實際工資已减少不少，生活已困難萬分，最近紐約，紐傑與康奈狄格三州的男女缝工六萬人又爲了要求增加工資和改善待遇宣佈全體罷工，且有牽及他業的趨勢，這工資和工時的爭執解决無疑是極端困難的。尤其是行政會擬令近已出校的學生重復入學校，翼减輕失業的嚴重情勢，更可見「復興運動」對於失業問題巳没有能力作有効的積極的救濟了。總之，因資本主義本身的劣點而造成的美國經濟恐慌，决不是羅斯福總統所主持「全國復興運動」所能解决的。正因同樣原因造成的世界經濟不景氣，生産衰退，失業恐慌，貿易低落，一切恐慌數字的增加，因各國關稅壁壘的增高，及因黃金跌價所引起的貨幣與匯兌政策的激烈鬥爭，而情况愈形惡劣的局面，亦决非世界經會議所能解决，所以世界經濟會議的毫無結果而休會，正是不足爲奇的。</p>
<p>生活影片公司臨時演員</p>
<h3>棺材裡的死人</h3>
<p>— 姚士泉</p>
<p>在影片公司做臨時演員的人，拍起戲來，是整日整夜的。有時接到早晨九點鐘拍戲的通告，那麽我八點鐘就要到公司。從九點鐘拍起，拍到明天早晨九點鐘，是很平常的事。一天到晚關在這不通風的鉛皮房子裏，冷天還好，熱天就不得了。在三十多盞强光度的電燈下，每一盞燈，其熱度至少像個電火爐。六月炎暑就是我們臨時演員拼命的時期，眞像死人關在棺材裏一樣，吹不着一絲風，透不到一毫氣。有時導演先生不顧你的死活，在熱天要拍冷天的戲，那麽你還要穿起皮衣，戴起皮帽子，雖然汗流浹背，頭昏眼花，熱得要命，爲了要像眞，佈景裏的大火爐，還要開起來。導演命令你說：「情節是這樣，你要裝做很怕冷的樣子，走近火爐去烤火。」那末，你一定要很自然的向前走，把你那已將燜熱的軀殼，再去多烤一下。如若不是這樣，那你又怎能得着這兩元的代價呢？你内心熱到發燒，</p>
<h3>自我職業介紹回音</h3>
<p>炳君：擬請先生担任社會科學敎員，希卽駕臨接洽。（賣興路明强中學龐子衡啟）</p>
<p>晴女士：請向下列各處接洽：㈠本埠郵政信箱一五九號劉我中君，㈡實興路明强中學龐子衡君，及㈢四川路四十一號卜内門公司營業部曹隠云君。</p>
<p>石女士：請向塘山路保定路源福里六十五號趙君面洽。</p>
<p>靜，石，兩女士：請示通訊處。（梅白格路一百十一號鞠某啟）</p>
<p>外表還得裝作冷到發抖。女大明星有人打扇，導演先生有氷淇淋，荷蘭水，但我們跑龍套的人，有的是什麽呢？除了血與汗！任你燒得滿頭熱氣上騰，像出籠的饅頭，女大明星却還要打趣說：「你像紅熱胖猪頭，」那時你一定要笑┆笑┆笑着吧！而且你最好要回答得滑稽一些說：「我像氷凍獅子頭」那末，</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>她們便會笑了。這不是羞辱，這是無上的光榮，因爲你們臨時龍套，是不配得着她們的嬌笑的！</p>
<p>導演先生殺人般的刑令不斷的發來：「預備開麥拉！快！┆┆死人！┆┆猪　！快走近些，烤火加煤，裝怕冷的樣子發抖。」這時我們的天主上帝的導演啊！他眞像八面威風的大官員，把我們無抵搧的小百姓，縛在刑架上，只好聽天由命了。一個镜頭拍完，「卡脫關燈，ＸＸ小姐受熱了吧？來人啊，打扇！┆┆荷蘭水！」在榨血機旁的一天一夜裏，這一聲是最和悅的，也是我們所常常聽着的。</p>
<p>迨戲拍完，天也亮了，於是領工錢。兩元的代價，介紹所要拿去六角扣頭，再除去四角錢的飯費，只有一塊錢到手。這個數目並不少，我以爲很多，一個月若能有八九天拍到，就是餓，也不會餓死了！一天一夜，拼死拼活，駡猪駡狗，腰痛腿酸，頭昏眼花，直到這時纔得回家休息，睡覺：十多里的歸程，只有用我不花錢的兩輛自行車，飛跑回去。</p>
<h3>「革命文豪高爾基」</h3>
<p>— 莊克能女士</p>
<p>丨　生海書店出版，定價大洋一元二角丨</p>
<p>費了三個晚間的時光，把革命文豪高爾基讀完。無疑的，這書叙述了高爾基的一生，是他的一部傳記。但是，我却認爲不可當牠一部尋常傳記，把牠輕易地讀過，须看作是靑年値得模擬的良範，勵志的基石。因爲他雖生在當時那樣黑暗，潮濕，泥濘，的社會裏，却仍能使用他的慧眼，看出人們的殘虐，無恥，愚魯，以及當時種種行爲的怪誕，即在他的兒童時代，他目睹了一切，已能激動他的心絃，掀起了他的不平與憤怒。他不以爲他自己出身微賤爲插鄙而引以爲恥辱，反因他親嘗的疾苦而練堅了他的意志。他絶不受外力引誘而遷就，不爲暴力壓抑而降服，始終與暴力相抗爭，給弱者以同情。他從事第一次職業的時候還有十歲，因他的那位具有怪癖的上司（廚子）硬要他讀書給他聽，因此就開始引起他對於讀書的志趣；自後他好像着了癮似的不肯與書本分開，終於博覽羣籍，由一個飄泊流浪於伏爾加河沿岸的無依者！曾飄流着做過碼頭上的工人，脚夫及船上廚子的學徒！一旦竟攀登了俄國文壇的最高峰，成爲今日名震寰宇的革命文豪。這並不是偶然的，是有他奮鬥的事蹟，不妥恊的精神，堅定的意志，銳敏的目光，爲大衆福利而惜自我犧牲的呼號，不與周遭　詐陰險之徒同流合污。這是多麽偉大，多麽値得人們崇拜的人格！無怪魯迅先生要說：「這書實在是給中國靑年很好的贈品。」因此，我希望每個靑年都能接受這個鄭重的贈品。</p>

<h3>七月七</h3>
<p>— 陳跳躍</p>
<p>細月亮灣着腰兒掛上溝邊的那株楊樹梢。初秋的夜風夾着「喞喞」的秋蟲的哀訴。幾條躺在塲上預備過夜的狗，不耐煩似的把腦袋兒衝着月光摔了兩摔，又躺着不動了。</p>
<p>初秋的夜啊呵，是悽凉的，悽凉的可是，今夜兒東嶽廟做戲丨「鵲橋相會」丨今夜兒是七月七。</p>
<p>打那座茅屋的紙窗裏望進去，在昏黯的燭光下，梅香巳把媽的藥煎好了，皺着眉兒自己嘗了嘗冷熱，便雙手捧到媽牀邊。</p>
<p>「媽！」媽的眼緊合着，腮膀兒上有兩朶焦紅，灰白的額冒着冷汗。往常，她病着不能起床時，總是不斷地哼，哼痛，哼　過，這回兒她可没哼過，老是這麽靜寂寂地，像悽凉的初秋的夜。</p>
<p>可是，今夜兒東嶽廟做戲丨「鵲橋相會」！今夜兒是七月七。</p>
<p>梅香把嘴凑到媽的耳邊：</p>
<p>「媽，藥煎好了。大夫說，這帖藥多少總有些兒效騐的。媽，你怎麽老是不響。大夫說：你的心思也太重了。媽，哥哥該不會有多大危險的。」</p>
<p>唉！唉！唉！生福這孩子┆我早┆早呌他不要跟那夥兒去┆去閙亂子的，現在被抓去了十幾天啦，一些消息都没有，恐怕大份是給害死了。唉！唉！唉！我的命也不會長，担憂你這年輕的女孩子，年輕的┆」老年紀的人害不起病。一害病話都說不響了。</p>
<p>「媽，你不用着急。哥哥總不致被害的，做官的總亦明白窮苦百姓的痛苦，就是工人很正當的要求老板加些工資，並不算是犯法吧！媽，藥快冷了，吃罷。」</p>
<p>患着第三期肺癆的梅香的媽，伸長了細瘦的頸根把藥剛喝下去，「嘟」的又吐出來啦。</p>
<p>「篤，篤，篤，」打門的響聲。</p>
<p>「誰啊？」梅香邊替媽拭去下巴兒上的藥汁，邊向打門那兒問。</p>
<p>「我！」</p>
<p>「我扶住着媽啦！」</p>
<p>「你東嶽廟不去嗎？我特地來找你的。」</p>
<p>對自己手腕兒上的媽臉瞧了一眼，「我不去了，我媽的病厲害得很，你一個人去吧。别忘了，帶段塘藕給我媽。」</p>
<p>「┆┆小狐媚子┆┆累人家白跑┆┆」</p>
<p>「你恨我了嗎？┆」</p>
<p>「┊┊」外邊的聲音没了。</p>
<p>一個肺病患者的心常常是淸醒的。</p>
<p>「誰呌你上東嶽廟去幹嗎啊？」</p>
<p>「前村的王三　　　　　女去呢！」</p>
<p>年輕姑娘的心是一樣的，像一枝纔透水面的連花在初秋的夜風裏摇曳着，可是梅香的心是悽凉的。</p>
<p>「哥哥眞的會不被殺害嗎？聯合着大夥兒很正當的要求老板加工資是犯法的嗎？做官的眞的會明白窮百姓的困苦嗎？年老而又病着的媽，┆┆年輕的自家兒┆┆？」想着，想着，一些兒希望的火是給初秋的夜風吹散啦　。千萬枝磨銳了的箭，一枝一枝穿過心朶，又一枝一枝的穿過背項。心朶的液汁變成眼涙，辛酸的，苦澀的，一粒又一粒，一行又一行。桌上的那枝燭也流涙啦。</p>
<p>一個病重的大年紀人，殘燭似地衝着這初秋的夜風，一刻兒就會熄滅的。　　屋外的細月亮灣着腰兒，移着輕的步，悄悄地爬到土地廟的屋脊。初秋的夜呵！是悽凉的，悽凉的，可是，今夜兒東嶽廟做戲！「鵲橋相會」丨今夜兒是七月七。</p>

<h3>再會，「時代落伍」的業餘周刋編輯！</h3>
<p>編者先生：請你不用驚駭，一個從未相識的後生小子，竟寫給你這樣一封信；假使你不是「剛愎自信」的話，那末請你靜心地讀這一封信罷！</p>
<p>我覺得整個的社會。，正在一個混亂黑暗的時期。階級的尖銳化，使小資産階級漸趨没落，於是反映在文藝上的，只是一般小資産者在没落期中的呻吟聲，以及埀死的哀鳴聲，不是嘆貧道苦，便是酒色女人。我覺得奇怪，何以小資産者的文人，只是終日頽廢，甘心向没落的途走，何以没有一個具有反抗的情緒，大聲呐喊的呢！</p>
<p>自從先生編業餘週刋後，的確使我很興奮。我雖與先生不相　，但我知道先生一定是一個小資産者，但又不甘　暴而在大聲呐喊中的　資産者。　不必用肉麻的辭句來恭維先生，但我認爲貴刋是各大報中最可觀的一張附刋。　　我對於先生呐喊的精神，很是佩服，但先生的意識，我認爲不充分，不完全，使我不得不深爲惋惜。也許我有我的見解，先生有先生的見解，「人各有志，豈能相强，」「道不同，則不相爲謀，」但我相信眞理只有一個，一加一决不會等於二以外的數目啊！</p>
<p>爲指出先生意識的錯誤起見。將先生的話先引證如下：</p>
<p>丨六月十一日「貧民的出路」！</p>
<p>「我們希望政府諸公應力自反省，體念中山先生四十年革命的維艱，</p>
<p>認淸楚社會一切擾亂不安的主因所在！窮人增多，從這一方面參照總理遺敎，努力於救濟工作，則國是前途，或有一綫生機。┆┆」</p>
<p>丨七月二日「小學敎師口中的民族前途！」</p>
<p>「我們敎望現在事實上負着責任的政府諸公，應淸夜扪心自己問着「┆┆┆」┆┆」</p>
<p>以上只摘出了兩段，並非斷章取義乃因原文辭長不錄。</p>
<p>從以上兩段話看來，原來先生的救國方法，只是一種「希望」，一種涉茫的「希望」，希望政府諸公的良心發現。我</p>

<p>覺得先生的苦口婆心，大聲呐喊，眞是可敬而復可憐，使我猛想起古史上一般忠臣義僕，直諫皇上，跪哭流涕的情形。假使皇恩浩蕩，採納忠言，則可以興邦安國，忠臣更可以升官列侯，但假使有一般不識好歹的君王，一怒而忠臣戮，再怒而九族滅，則事情糟糕了！</p>
<p>先生以爲民族的興亡盛衰，繫於政府諸公一念之間，這種十足唯心論調，意出之於先生之口，豈非幽天下之大默？我們　然能原諒先生的苦衷，在這年頭兒，眞所謂禍從口出，腹誹有罪，不能暢所欲言，但難道我們就此掩却天良，甘作違心之論麽！</p>
<p>在這樣一個狂風暴雨的時代，在這樣一個民不聊生，民生憔悴的時代，我們依舊以「希望」二字安慰自己，欺騙自己，麻醉自己，我們眞覺得自己太可憐了，可憐得如一隻希望主人恕宥的羔羊。</p>
<p>最後，我希望先生，在政府諸公没有力自反省淸夜扪心之前，先生自己也不妨力自反省淸夜捫心一下。小子的話，是耶非耶，幸三思之！</p>

<h3>不敢消受的顧愛</h3>
<p>— 芳女士</p>
<p>第一批</p>
<p>我每天起床很遲，這不是我成性的怠懶，而是疲憊至極的身體需要一下子安息，我還感覺得這祗是很短很短的安息時間，所以，總要到九點鐘敲過了，我纔懶洋洋的爬了起來。</p>
<p>剛剛翻下床，照例的，我的白髮蒼蒼可憐的媽媽，立刻就要半顛半倒地端來了一盆洗臉水，而後又捧着一壹熱水和兩塊冷饅頭，於在一個三隻脚的棹上。洗好了面，搽上一重脂粉，整一整身上的衣服，三口兩嘴吃完了饅頭，喝了一杯熱水。就急急忙忙地出門，飛跑上我們的飯館裏去了。在九點半鐘以前，我們是必须到飯館去做我們的事，遲差了一分鐘，飯館老板就要大發雷霆之怒，肆意叱咤的。要是今天門市稍爲冷落些，那更是我們的倒霉。老板的恫言，决不是一時的衝動。他說：「　貨！鬼看也怕死，誰還要來給你招待。今天的門市，要算賬賠償，明天就恕不請駕。」唉，我們是不敢回一句話的，再動了他的無名火，我们的飯碗是當眞會丢了，祗好把眼涙呑下肚裏，深更歸來，才擁被大哭。</p>
<p>進了飯館，我們先要留心各人所管的部位，檯子，凡子，檯布，油醋瓶，究竟髒不髒，髒的要用淸水好好再擦過，不備的東西，我們一樣一樣的都要預備好。小伙計雖然打掃過一次地板，但我們還要經過一次的檢視。這些雜事都注意整理以後，我們就須得到廚房裏，去檢點今天所有的菜件，那一味是昨天没有的，那一味是今天新排出來的，我們要一一記好，等到貴客光臨，我們才好招待。這時候，大概是快十一點鐘了，我們才閒下來恭候着佳賓。</p>
<p>通常盛市的時間，總在下午三點鐘開始，最熱閙的要算是在晚上九點鐘。一個三尺多寛的廚房門，最忙的時候，十幾個女同事們，急急忙忙在這個小門裏端來端去，跑來跑去，要不是經騐豐富，一下子就要碰個滿懷，把菜盤打下來的。在貴客佳賓斟酒吃菜的時候，不待說，我們是必須奉陪的，慇懃而熱烈的奉陪的。爲了要得着貴人的小賬的恩給我們不只要巧言令色，還得忍受貴人一切侮辱的言語和舉動，不，在他們還說是隆情的顧愛哩！天呀，侍者眞是妓女之流亞嗎？假如不是爲了我的龍鐘老態的父母，和爲了三個年少的弟妹，爲了這一家的生活，我何苦來做任人顧愛的女招待呢？太顧愛了，可憐人是不敢消受的。退一步說，假使飯館老板僱用的月薪，能夠維持這五條生命於不餓死，那我又何至於爲着貪圖貴客佳賓們的小賬，不惜把自己給他們當作玩偶呢？</p>
<p>整天的勤務，疲倦的身子，恨不得就把這塊地板當做褥床。好容易，自鳴鐘巳敲過夜半的一點，貴人們漸漸地鳳去臺空了，再等等老板算一算門市的收入，看看他的喜怒哀樂，自己和姊妹們也平分了貴人們的恩賜，最後，聽着老板照例的怪呌：「明天早些來！」我們才分道揚鑣，各自回家。</p>
<p>「媽媽！開門！」</p>
<p>她同樣地還睜着眼睛等候我。</p>
<p>「小鶯，你回來啦！已經兩點多鐘了。」</p>
<h3>「尋開心」底藝術</h3>
<p>— 震元</p>
<p>第二批</p>
<p>北平女招待的生活是很勞苦的；雖則她們的收入多寡很不一律，但大多數只能勉强糊口。她們的工資是很少的，每月最多也不過三四塊錢，完全是靠分小費。可是，她們對於工資的多寡，縱然是幾毛錢之差，也爭得很厲害的，原因是工資的多寡，分别着她們的等級，等級高的，可以多分得些小費，她們除了正當分得小費之外，還時時可以得到特别小費。特别小費就是客人另外秘密給她一個人獨得的小費，這不用說，只是那些具有特别能力的女招待的專利了。還有那些因爲很能夠招徠，跟店東有特别的契約，如個人須得全數小費十分之幾等，也是不少的，如北平有一個飯館，男女夥計共有二十餘人之多，其中有一個女招待獨得小費十分之四，只拿其餘的十分之六分給大家。</p>
<p>講到她們招待客人的情形，對於那些只以吃飯爲主要目的的客人，那是跟男堂倌一樣的，但對於那些发尋開心爲主要目的的客人，却很費周旋了。一個以尋開心爲主要目的的客人，他進去不是立刻就點菜的，總是先要一壼茶，慢慢地喝着，不時的把女招待喚進房來，不說要手巾把，就說茶巳冷了，說東說西，问長問短，總得幾十分鐘以後，才肯點萲。及至遞上菜單，等他點菜時，他一面裝着點菜，一面瞎三話四，點三兩個菜有時會用到一二十分鐘　。她如果不耐煩或是爲着别的客人的呼喚走開了，他便會立刻敲響碗碟逼她走回來的。他所點的菜總是幾味吃酒的菜，等到菜來了，於是慢慢的吃着酒，也跟吃茶時一樣，不時的喚人，要這要那的，無非也是要女招待在房間裏多停留一會，好讓他尋個開心。酒吃過了，再點幾個飯菜，飯也是慢慢的吃。飯吃過了，再來一壼茶，仍然是慢慢地喝。每每吃一頓飯耗費去三四個鐘頭的。女招待遇到這種客人，不但不能生氣，還得特别好好的招待，因爲一來是自己的職責，二來得罪了貴客是了不得的。可是也有特别歡迎這種客人的，因爲特别小費多從這個地方來的。</p>
<h3>吃女招待</h3>
<p>— 季仲燕</p>
<p>第三批</p>
<p>在北平雇有女招待的都是吃食店。開店的巧妙地將飲，食，男，女四個字凑到一起，眞的是抓住了一個絶妙的題材。這還帶些幽默化的哲學。</p>
<p>其實，在北平，雇女招待的店舖也很有限，大概不外乎都是新興小吃食店和咖啡館。老的酒飯館，除了政府南遷之後倒閉的瑞記廣和居┆┆等不算外，現在開着的東新樓，福全館，全聚德，忠信堂，玉華台，便宜坊之類數一數二的飯舖，似乎並没有受到這種所謂風氣的影響，依舊我行我素。照情形看上去，其營業也許比雇女招待的店舖要好些。所以，女招待在北平，完全是被店主利用了做一種廣告性質的「活招牌」的。在雇有女招待店舖子的門口，你可以很不費事的發現兩塊同樣大小的紅紙招貼，這一邊假使寫的是「新鮮悶羊肉」，那另一邊，不消說，凖是「年輕女招待」。</p>
<p>這┆┆眞是從那裏說起！</p>
<p>北平某當局曾經發表了一個只許女招待空藍布大褂的通告，這未免太開玩笑了。可是也只能禁她們這一項，其餘的鞋襪脂粉，當然不能再申嚴禁，於是一部份的招待們便少不得要將顔色舖開到臉上去了。</p>
<p>要出奇的便是有一班絶顶無聊的文人（？）公然在報紙上寫作這樣的小說「喂！老李，吃女招待去嗎？」</p>
<p>「幹┆┆」</p>
<p>女招待可以吃嗎？怪哉！因此北平市上便多了一種種童謡：「女招待，眞不癩（不癩即不壞）。吃三毛，給一塊。就是不要老太太！」</p>

<h3>Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang</h3>
<h3>Lead Troops to Leave Zhangbei</h3>
<p>丨Result of Xuanwu Ruan and Yunrong Zhang's Mediation丨</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan Personally Goes to Zhangbei</p>
<p>Troops are Gradually Transferred to Zhangyuan</p>
<p>Tang Yulin Expresses Willingness Not to Defect and To Return Troops to the Nation</p>
<p>Requests Guarantees of Safety for Life and Property; Authorities Have Agreed</p>
<p>Sun Liangcheng Sends Telegram Announcing Retirement to His Hometown</p>
<p>The issue of Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang in Zhangjiakou, after Xuanwu Ruan and Yunrong Zhang went to Zhangbei to mediate separately with the two sides, the provincial government received a phone call from Ruan on the evening of the 25th. At that time, Song and Fang spoke on the phone. Song expressed his willingness to personally go to Zhangbei and asked Fang to wait temporarily. Fang was very humble to Song, saying that he was very sorry for initiating this action and bringing so many old troops from the 29th Army. He personally decided to leave immediately. At the same time, Ji Hongchang also left Zhangbei. Song Zheyuan then went to Zhangbei in five cars at 12:30 pm on the 26th, accompanied by Xiao Zhenying and a group of guards, and planned to return to the province on the 27th. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Sun Liangcheng of Zhangjiakou sent a telegram on the 26th to announce his retirement to his hometown and will return to Tianjin in a few days. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang left Zhangbei this time. It is said that one of their armies had already arrived there to defend against the puppet army from the Zhanyuan area. Therefore, Fang and Ji decided to leave Zhangbei immediately and head north. Now, a unit of Feng's division of Song's army will go north. As of noon on the 26th, there were no more troops under Fang and Ji in Zhangbei County. It is said that Fang's troops recently consisted only of the Training Division and a unit under Zheng Guilin, with very few people. Ji's direct subordinates also numbered only a little over a thousand. Surrounding Ji were several people with quite colorful backgrounds, including Xuan Xiafu. Xuan has been appointed as the division commander of Ji's troops. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that Song thinks the situation in eastern Chahar is tense. Li Shouxin's puppet army in the Dolun area seems to be spying to the north. Tang's rebel army is also spying on Guyuan. In order to consolidate the border, he is going to Zhangbei today to inspect and reorganize the miscellaneous troops. He plans to go to Wanquan first, inspect Zhang Renjie's troops, and then go to Zhangbei. In addition to the military headquarters and the Feng Zhi'an unit under its command, which have gone to Zhangyuan from Pingdong one after another, he has also telegraphed Liu Ru, the division stationed in Pingdong, and Zhao Dengyu's unit stationed in Shizhuang, to leave for Zhangyuan to fill the posts. The Military Council has allocated five train cars for these two divisions. Liu and Zhao's divisions are moving to Zhangyuan today. Song decided that after Liu and Zhao's divisions arrive in Zhangyuan to take over, he will transfer the Feng Zhi'an unit, which was originally stationed in Zhangyuan, to the area east of Zhangbei to fill the posts.</p>
<p>The original troops under Fang and Ji stationed in Zhangbei will be led by Xuanwu Ruan and Yunrong Zhang to southern Chahar to reorganize. Tang's troops, originally stationed in the Dage area, received military pay from the puppet Fang for a month. Tang's troops retreated westward due to opposition from the local people and arrived at the border of Guyuan on the 25th. Tang recently sent representatives to Zhang, stating that Tang has no intention of defecting. If the authorities can guarantee the safety of his life and property, he will return the troops to the nation and return to Tianjin to live out his remaining years. It is heard that the authorities have agreed to Tang's request, and after reorganization, he will be given funds to disband. Jiang Bocheng and Hou Ying are in Zhang, waiting for Zhang Yunrong and Ruan Xuanwu to return to Zhang, and after expressing acceptance of all the plans for Fang and Ji, they will return to Beiping to report. The candidates for the Chahar Provincial Committee and the heads of various departments remain the same as originally planned and will be announced in the short term. Lü Fu has agreed to take the position of Director of Education. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Tang Yulin defected, more than 5,000 of his remaining troops retreated from Dajiao Town to Guyuan. Ji's troops are currently gathered around Baimiaozi. The authorities believe that if Tang's troops are willing to surrender, they can be reorganized appropriately. However, since most of the troops are old and weak, they will be drastically reduced in the future. It is planned to order Song to handle the inspection, verification of weapons, and reorganization on the spot. The designation of the 55th Army has now been explicitly canceled by the Military Council. Its troops in Baotou have been ordered to be eliminated and reduced by the 41st Army, and the remaining troops left in the Chahar area will be disarmed and disbanded by Pang's army. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying has sent a telegram to Beiping, explaining the situation of receiving salaries from the Military Council and the reasons for his temporary stay in Baotou and inability to move west. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Suifenhe</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Last night, a large number of bandits attacked Suifenhe and Hengdaohezi. A fierce battle broke out and intensified. After a long time, the bandits finally suffered heavy losses and retreated. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Talks About Recent Events</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi said that the New Provinces Liaison Office has been established for a long time, but due to inconvenient transportation, it has been handled by local governments on behalf. This time, Minister Luo went to the New Provinces and plans to renovate the office and decided to directly send a special commissioner from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take over the position. Feng's entry into Beijing is no longer a problem. The central government will give Feng the title of Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy. All parties have this opinion, but it is not yet fully confirmed. If Feng agrees, it will be reflected in reality. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>The Upper Reaches of the Yellow River Have Risen Sharply, and Rushing Currents Are Flowing Downstream</h3>
<p>The Henan Provincial Government Has Strictly Guarded the River Dikes</p>
<p>Han Fuqu Goes to Luokou to Inspect</p>
<p>The Three Daokou Areas of Feicheng Have Overflowed, Flooding Dozens of Villages,</p>
<p>Yutai Has Been Flooded with a Fierce Water Current Unprecedented in Scale</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Bian News, obtained news from Yuan that the upper reaches of the Yellow River have risen sharply, with rushing currents of three zhang, flowing downstream. It is estimated that it will arrive in Bian in about twenty-six or seven hours. The provincial government has strictly guarded the river dikes. When the water arrives, cannons will be fired as a signal, and the military and civilians will be mobilized to deal with the danger. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu and the Mayor of Jinan, Wen Chenglie, went to Luokou today to inspect the Yellow River. Reporters followed. The Luokou dam has been leveled by the water. Beiluokou is surrounded by water, and the fields and houses are all in the water. People live in straw sheds on the dikes, and the sound of crying can be heard. Farmers ride wooden rafts to collect ears of grain, but they get very little. A year of hard work has been lost to the Yellow River. Going forward to Yangzhuang, the water is large and the current is rapid, and the situation is the most dangerous. Fortunately, Wu Huawen, the brigade commander of the pistol brigade, is supervising the soldiers to deal with the danger there. Otherwise, a breach would occur there, and Jinan would be flooded. Further ahead to Beidianzi, the water level has dropped and the workers are stable. The villagers are performing operas to thank the gods. They returned to Jinan at four o'clock. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the water level at Luokou on the Yellow River dropped by five centimeters, the water level is 31 meters, 2 cun, and 5 fen. All the dangerous works in Qihe have been reinforced. The dam of Li Family in the downstream Huimin area is fine. Zhang Lianjia returned to Jinan from Luokou to meet Han, reporting that the three Daokou areas of Feicheng's People's Embankment, the Yuan Family, Xu Family, and Song Family, have overflowed, flooding dozens of villages, all of which are mountainous areas. The villagers have taken refuge in the mountains, and the sound of crying shakes the wilderness. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Yutai telegraphed that the water from the breach in Lanfeng flowed into the Eastern Branch River in the county, two and a half meters deep, at a speed of fifty meters per minute. On the 19th, it entered Nanyang Lake, and the Eastern Branch River is already full. If it rises again, it will be dangerous. The water head of the main stream is high and the speed is extremely rapid. When it reaches Longguji in Peixian, it splits into two streams, one flowing northeast into Zhaoyang Lake and the other flowing northwest into the Bian River at the junction of Yu and Pei, two meters deep, which is already out of the bank and flooding the fields. Most of the seventh district of Yutai has been flooded, and the water continues to rise, which is unprecedentedly fierce. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han talked about disaster relief. Jiang's reply telegraphed urging the government to handle it quickly. Wang's reply telegraphed instructed the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to handle it. It is too slow to solve the urgent need, so the province has to try its best to raise funds. The civil defense and public security bureaus of various counties will be merged, and the inspection and testing sites will be closed. The provincial funds will be used for disaster relief. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>The Six-Province Flood Control Conference to be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A total of fourteen representatives from the six provinces and various agencies of the Six-Province Flood Control Conference will report to Beijing. The conference has received proposals, totaling sixteen from Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, and the Huai River Guidance Association, which are being compiled and printed. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Six-Province Flood Control Conference is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 28th. Jiangsu Province proposed six important cases: ㈠ Please refer to the precedent of the 20th year of the Republic of China for the flood in the Jianghuai region and submit a request to the Central Government to establish a National Government Disaster Relief Association to handle Yellow River projects and disaster relief, so as to unify authority. ㈡ For post-disaster projects, the breaches in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong should be blocked and repaired first. ㈢ Please dredge the accumulated water from the breaches. ㈣ Please allocate funds to repair the overflowing downstream lakes and river embankments. ㈤ Please add a Jiangsu Province commissioner to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. ㈥ It is recommended to establish a Yellow River downstream rectification committee. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, and Li Shilin, Director of the Engineering Section of the River Bureau, went to Beijing to attend the flood control conference. The River Bureau proposed two cases: building dikes at the estuary and increasing the construction of stone dams. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Huai River Guidance Association reported that the Yellow River in the upper reaches of Gansu had risen by four meters and the Luo River had risen by three meters, which is estimated to affect the downstream by the end of this month. In addition to telegraphing the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to quickly block the breaches, it also telegraphed the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui and the Xuzhou Administrative Commissioner to order their subordinates to properly defend and provide relief for the Huai River and Canal dikes. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>An Aerial Survey Team Surveys the Yellow River</p>
<h3>The River Breaches in Three Places, Overflowing Separately; the Junction of Henan and Shandong Has Become a Land of Lakes</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The General Staff Headquarters previously sent an aerial survey team to measure the Yellow River in Shandong and Henan with measuring machine No. 1. Now the machine has completed the measurement. Technicians Zhu Siyu and Wang Yingdong, and pilot Zhao Jingxian drove the plane from Bian to Xu on the morning of the 26th. According to them, when they went north, they flew with Wang Yingyu over Xu, Bian, and arrived in Ji. Looking down at the water situation from the air, they measured in detail for three days after returning to Beijing from Ji on the 22nd. It is estimated that the river breached in three places: Changyuan, Dongming, and Lanfeng. The Chang River flows north into Puyang and Puyang Fan. The East River strikes east to Zengzhou to reach Jiaju. The Lan River flows south through Kaocheng to enter Fengpei. The junction of Henan and Shandong has become a land of lakes. However, the current water level has decreased, and if no more water comes from the upper reaches, it can avoid expansion. It is planned to fly over Weishan Lake in Xu and the water flowing from the rivers in western Shandong into the Weishan Lake before returning south. It was found that the sky was cloudy and cloudy this afternoon. Zhu et al. are scheduled to measure Wei and return to Beijing on the 27th to report to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Conference which will be held on the 28th. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

(Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>The Jiangbei Transportation Engineering Bureau Requests the Opening of Six Dikes on the Salt River</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Xu Dingkang, Director of the Jiangbei Transportation Engineering Bureau, telegraphed the Provincial Government that 20,000 laborers in Suqian are rushing to work on the six important embankments of the mulberry and yellow transport, so there is no danger in Suqian. In order to relieve the danger of the six embankments, it is necessary to open the six dams of the Salt River. Please urgently telegraph the transport envoy to prepare. It is found that the six dikes of the Salt River are the gateway for river water to flow into the Guan River. Salt merchants also store water for transport, which is related. Prepare in advance, and it can be opened immediately in an emergency.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Yangzhou) The Jiangbei Transportation Engineering Bureau ordered the Huai Pi section to rush to build an Yellow River interception dam on the Shunqing River to prevent entry into the Inner Grand Canal. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>The Situation in the Counties of Eastern Luan is Terrible After the War Zone is Taken Over</h3>
<p>Bandits are Rampant Along the Great Wall Line with Sophisticated Weapons</p>
<p>Openly Extorting Supplies from the Qinhuangdao Customs</p>
<p>The County Magistrate of Luan County Broke Through From Zhugezhuang and Retreated to Zhangzhuang</p>
<p>Traitors are Rampant in Tangshan Under the Protection of Japanese Soldiers, Running Gambling and Opium</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the war zone was taken over, the security police in the counties of eastern Luan were insufficient in strength with only 2,000 people, causing the bandit atmosphere to become more and more intense. There are more than 20,000 bandits in the mountains along the Great Wall line to Qinhuangdao, Zunhua, Jixian, and Qian'an, with sophisticated guns and weapons. The bandits would even ask the Qinhuangdao Customs to borrow 50,000 yuan for supplies. If they do not agree, they will occupy it. The Qinhuangdao Customs is quite dangerous. The villagers north of the railway cannot bear the harassment and have moved to the south of the railway. Yin Tong said that bandits are rampant in eastern Luan because of insufficient police force. It is necessary to deploy troops to eliminate them. He met with Military Officer Chaisan yesterday about the bandit disaster in the war zone. Chaisan said that if the Chinese side has a solution, notify the Japanese side in advance. In order to avoid misunderstandings, they will provide convenience. He visited He today to ask for instructions. The handover of the passes along the Great Wall and Yuguan will be discussed after Huang and Song meet and decide on a solution. After returning north, he will go to Changchun to negotiate with the Kwantung Army. Dong Tianhua, the county magistrate of Yutian, was insulted by the local army and returned to Tianjin to report the situation. Yesterday, he was accompanied by Liu Shisun to go there. The Shi Yousan army stationed in Yutian will still be transferred. Zhang Jinchen, the county magistrate of Luan County, was surrounded by bandits. He has not received the report yet. Lei Shourong said that after Lingzhi took office, he has informally expressed that he will eventually return the major passes of the Great Wall to China, but it depends on China's diplomatic policy to determine the time of return. Most of the people coming and going to the small passes are Chinese. In fact, our police have arrived in the areas of the small passes. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The original quota for the security police in the war zone was 9,000 people, which is still far from enough. How to draw up the remaining number must wait for Yu Xuezhong to return before it can be carried out. Shi Yousan's miscellaneous army in Yutian has a total of 1,260 people, with six or seven hundred guns. The internal composition is extremely complex, including militia, bandits, and military personnel. The reorganization has not yet begun. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bandits are rampant from Yuguan to Lengkou, equipped with light and heavy machine guns, mortars, and field guns. The Liujiang Coal Mine has stopped production, and employees and their families have gone to Qinhuangdao to take refuge. Zhang Jinchen, the county magistrate of Luan County, led a thousand militiamen and twenty pacification team members. He broke through from Zhu Gezhuang and retreated to Zhang Zhuang. There are about 4,000 bandits. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The head of the Tangshan Japanese Gendarmerie, Zhongshan, instigated the traitor Li Baozhang to arbitrarily arrest Guo Shikui and Qiu Pin, two directors of the Meat Industry Association, falsely accusing them of being communists. The meat industry was in an uproar and went on strike. The Japanese are engaged in the opium and gambling business in Tangshan, posting a sign on the door of the Japanese government-approved club. Last week, Song Naigan, the director of the Public Security Bureau, sent police to raid and arrest them, but within a few days, the Japanese soldiers protected them and resumed business. The puppet state is doing its best to absorb silver dollars, and the banknotes of the Bank of Communications and other banks have been greatly affected. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is like climbing a tree to catch fish to hope that the Japanese army will withdraw from Yuguan, Yucheng, and the passes of the Great Wall, which they are occupying. Dong Tianhua, the county magistrate of Yutian, was beaten and humiliated by the puppet army and came to the province, but he has not dared to return to his post. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Luo Wengan Stays in Xi'an</p>
<h3>Unable to Fly West Yesterday Due to Rain</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Luo Wengan arrived in the provincial capital at 1:35 pm on the 25th. Yang Hucheng, Shao Lizi, and others waited at the airport beforehand. The Suijing Superintendent's Office sent a battalion of soldiers to stand guard. After Luo got off the plane, the military band played a grand march. Shao introduced the welcomers one by one. Luo, wearing a silk shirt, immediately rode into the city with Shao and Yang and stayed at the Suijing Superintendent's Office to rest. Luo told reporters at the airport that the purpose of his trip to Xinjiang was to inspect the judiciary and foreign affairs. He will stay in Xi'an for two days to inspect the judiciary of Shaanxi Province. He is scheduled to fly to Lanzhou on the original plane on the 27th. He will also stay in Lan for two days, and then fly west to Yun. Luo's plane took off from Beijing at 8:00 am, and he did not stop at Luoyang. The accompanying personnel were Lin Zhendong, Counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Feng Youzhen, Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, and Wang Juelan, aide-de-camp. Shao Yang is scheduled to hold a welcome dinner for Luo at Xincheng Building at 4 pm. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Luo Wengan, after lunch at the Suijing Superintendent's Office on the 25th, accompanied by Feng Youzhen and Meng Zhaodong, President of the High Court, inspected the high and district courts, prisons, and detention centers. Luo gave detailed instructions on everything. At six o'clock, he went to the Suijing Superintendent's Office to attend a banquet hosted by Shao Yang, accompanied by the party committees and provincial committees. They dispersed happily at around eight o'clock. Luo made the following remarks to the Central News Agency reporter: Because I am eager to enter Xinjiang, I have changed my plan to fly to Lanzhou at 2:00 pm on the 26th. I will fly to Suzhou in one or two days to refuel, and then fly to Hami, make a short stay, meet Ma Zhongying, and discuss some matters. Then I will fly to Dihua to meet Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai, and represent the National Government Executive Yuan to swear in Liu Sheng. I will also go to Tacheng Yili, and then go to southern Xinjiang for inspection. It was originally planned to have two batches of entourage, carrying diplomatic documents, enter Xinjiang by land from Suiyuan. Whether it is needed will be determined after arriving in Xinjiang. Ambassador Yan has telegraphed Beijing that he will come to Xinjiang to meet me, which must be decided after arriving in Xinjiang. As for the transfer of prisoners to the Northwest for reclamation, it must be determined after contacting all relevant parties. I have briefly discussed and communicated with Shao Yang and Meng Zhaodong, President of the High Court, about the various points of transportation in the Northwest. After gathering opinions from all parties, I will make an overall plan. This trip is expected to take four months. The route of return is not yet determined. I inspected the judiciary of Shaanxi Province, and President Meng gave a detailed report on various situations. I also gave detailed instructions and instructed him to prepare a detailed written report and plan to be submitted to the ministry for review. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Luo Wengan was originally scheduled to continue flying west on the morning of the 26th. The No. 1 aircraft has been repaired and is waiting for departure, but there was heavy rain on the morning of the 26th, which did not stop until noon, and the weather was not good. Luo plans to fly west after the weather improves. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Liu Piguang Talks About Li Du Having No Intention of Going to Xinjiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Piguang, the representative of Li Du, arrived in Beijing from Guling on the 26th. According to what he told reporters, Li suffered from miliaria rubra and has now completely recovered, but his face is still numb. After resting for another ten days, he can go down the mountain. Reports that Li will go to Moganshan to meet Ma are not true. Also, the statement that Li will go to Xinjiang to reorganize his troops is untrue. The Ministry of Political Affairs has not issued such an order, and Li has no such motivation. Moreover, for the troops in Xinjiang, Li has sent Wang Ziyao to contact Governor Sheng to discuss the establishment of the organization. It is estimated that the Ji army will be organized into three brigades and the Hei army into one brigade. On the 25th, he received a telegram from Wang, who will take a plane to Beijing that day. Li asked Zhu Ziqiao to announce the donations. He originally did not want to express his opinion, but because Zhu telegraphed to inquire, he had to reply. For the sake of peace and quiet, Li has decided not to express any further opinions in the future and will let the Investigation Committee handle it. Li has sent Councilor Jiang Ying north to investigate and comfort the families of officials and officers in Tianjin and Beijing. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui Leads Troops to Retreat to Kangding</p>
<p>[The North and South Banks of the Yalong River No Longer Have Traces of This Army</p>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Wenhui led the remnants of his army to Kangding. There are no traces of the 24th Army on the north and south banks of the Yalong River. Chen Hongwen, the division commander of the army captured by the Chongqing army, has been escorted to Chengdu. Shi Shaowu was shot in Qiong, and his head was sent to the province. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Chengdu Conference is said to be scheduled to open on September 1. Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, Li Qixiang, and Luo Zezhou will all attend this meeting summoned by Liu Xiang to discuss the collection of the military affairs against Liu Wenhui, and the thorough suppression of the Reds and the aftermath issues. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xiang recently sent Yu Wei to Beijing to report everything to the central government. At 5 pm on the 26th, Yu visited President Wang and gave a detailed account of the Sichuan army's suppression of the Reds and the political situation in various parties. According to Wang, since the Sichuan situation has been resolved militarily, he hopes that Liu Xiang can thoroughly unify the Sichuan government, and the Liu Wenhui troops should be disbanded to reduce the burden on the people and eliminate the source of chaos. Liu Wenhui's remaining troops of over 10,000 are incapable of stabilizing Xikang. Yu suggested that Wenhui be ordered to come to Beijing for employment to stabilize the Sichuan situation. The situation of the Red bandits in Sichuan is serious, and he hopes that Liu Xiang will follow the plan he presented and quickly eliminate them. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Saito Prays for Spiritual Guidance; Presidents of Both Parties Are Eager to Stabilize the Hearts of the Japanese People</p>
<h3>若槻 Answered Saitō and Expressed Dissatisfaction to the House of Peers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning at 9:30 AM, Seiyūkai President Wakatsuki visited Prime Minister Saitō at his official residence to reciprocate the Prime Minister's visit to his residence the other day. He also reported that the matters discussed during their previous meeting had been approved by the party's leadership. The Prime Minister expressed his gratitude for this. He mentioned that while attending the naval review yesterday and today, he met President Suzuki, who told him that he would be unable to visit this week due to other commitments and planned to have a second meeting next week. Wakatsuki left after ten minutes. Because Wakatsuki had stated during the meeting on the 24th that the Seiyūkai would actively support the government, he did not discuss specific national policies today. (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After meeting with Wakatsuki, Prime Minister Saitō said, "President Wakatsuki's visit was a formality. We did not discuss party or national matters. It is meaningless for the government not to establish a grand national policy as a foundation for this emergency. Whether the national policy will be decided by myself and the presidents of the two major parties is still uncertain. There are rumors here that I will meet with Adachi, the president of the Kokumin Dōmei, but I have not considered this. There seems to be criticism from the House of Peers that the government and the Seiyūkai are colluding to determine national policy. However, this is only superficial criticism based on the report of the May 15th Incident. In this extraordinary situation, I believe it is appropriate to dispel public anxiety through the most prudent means. Therefore, I am determined to make efforts in this direction." (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) President Wakatsuki said, "Today's visit to the Prime Minister was a formality. Since all issues were discussed in the previous meeting, I did not raise any national policy issues today. The Prime Minister may continue to meet with President Suzuki in the future, but it is unlikely that the presidents of both parties will repeatedly negotiate with the Prime Minister. I do not need to meet with the Prime Minister in the future, and it seems the Prime Minister also sees no need for it." (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, Seiyūkai President Wakatsuki paid a return visit to Prime Minister Saitō, stating explicitly that the Seiyūkai does not wish to be coerced in any way by the agreement of policies between the Seiyūkai and the government. Prime Minister Saitō also repeatedly stated that the so-called national policy of the Seiyūkai is merely a reference for the government's administration and does not carry any coercive significance. Seiyūkai President Suzuki will visit Prime Minister Saitō next Monday. The future of policy coordination can be decided after observing Suzuki's attitude. It is reported that the Japanese government is still using the Seiyūkai's policies as reference material and will establish a National Policy Deliberation Council to determine the national policy for the next ten or fifteen years. It will include the presidents of the Seiyūkai, Minseitō, and Kokumin Dōmei, the presidents of the upper and lower houses, influential figures from both houses, and elders from the army and navy as members of a permanent organization to prevent party corruption. (China United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning at 9:00 AM, Hara Kumao, secretary to Prince Saionji, the Genrō, visited Prime Minister Saitō to inquire about the meetings between Saitō, Suzuki, and Wakatsuki. It is said that after the national policy is coordinated, Saitō will visit Adachi, the president of the Kokumin Dōmei, and President Konoe of the House of Peers to report on the progress of the coordination. (China United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The policies coordinated between the Seiyūkai and the government will not establish organizations such as review boards. The specific implementation will be carried out separately by each ministry for matters within their respective jurisdiction. Major matters requiring political handling will be discussed and agreed upon by Saitō, Suzuki, and Wakatsuki at any time. Also, reference materials will be collected when necessary to determine implementation methods. (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kōseikai of the House of Peers held a meeting at the Shōwa Kaikan this morning to exchange opinions on the meetings between Prime Minister Saitō and the presidents of the two major parties. The majority opinion was that the political parties lacked credibility with the people, and it was regrettable that the Prime Minister shook hands with political parties under the pretext of national unity. The cause of social instability today lies in the corruption and degeneration of political parties and financial cliques. Therefore, without eradicating this root, how can public anxiety be swept away? After various discussions, the meeting reached the following conclusion: Prime Minister Saitō's intention seems to be to stabilize the political situation. However, the current cabinet should be mindful of the spirit of its formation, determine its national policy platform, and move forward bravely, which can refresh the public's mind and restore the political world to normalcy. Also, the political parties should reflect on themselves and strive to restore the public's trust, which is their urgent task. (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In an attempt to achieve national unity, Prime Minister Saitō seems to be considering visiting Adachi, the president of the Kokumin Dōmei. It is reported that the visit will not be immediate but will take place after an agreement is reached with the Seiyūkai, in the sense of a report. At that time, he will also visit President Konoe of the House of Peers to seek understanding. Furthermore, the Prime Minister will meet with the presidents of the three parties: Seiyūkai, Minseitō, and Kokumin Dōmei simultaneously. If so, the Seiyūkai says that they will not refuse when asked. Therefore, a meeting between the Prime Minister and the leaders of the three parties may be realized. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Japan Severs Ties with the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Various Conventions Still Ratified</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Since the Extraordinary Assembly of the League of Nations took a decision on the Manchurian problem, Japan, although having notified its withdrawal from the League of Nations, continues to notify the Secretariat of the League of Nations of its ratification of various international conventions. Among the important ratification documents sent to the Secretariat today, there are three: (1) Convention on the Uniform Law for Cheques, (2) Convention on the Settlement of Conflicts of Laws concerning Cheques, and (3) Convention on Stamp Duties on Cheques.

<p>Takahashi Advocates Stockpiling Grain</p>
<h3>Believes It Is for Use in Case of Emergency</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, Finance Vice-Minister Kuroda and Accounting Bureau Chief Fujii visited Finance Minister Takahashi in Hayama to report on departmental affairs and to seek instructions on financial policy. After the meeting, Finance Minister Takahashi discussed his financial policy as follows: (1) New government bonds should still be exclusively purchased by the Bank of Japan. It is appropriate to not publicly sell new bonds for 20 or 30 years. (2) Among the new budgets of various ministries, some may be impossible to cut. However, in principle, the new project expenses of each ministry should be appropriated from the existing expenses of each ministry. (3) The rural problem must start with stabilizing the prices of agricultural products. Therefore, the fund for purchasing rice should be increased. The farmers who benefit from these bonds should also share the interest. Purchasing rice can not only increase the prices of agricultural products but also be used in case of emergency. Many in the world believe that food can be obtained from Manchuria. This view can be said to be wrong. At the earliest, Manchuria can provide Japan with food in ten years. Therefore, from the standpoint of national defense, it is also necessary to stockpile rice. (China United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Kantō Textile Industry Decides to Continue Production Cuts</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kantō Textile Industry held a luncheon meeting at the Industrial Club today to discuss the reduction rate of production after October. Because the export situation of cotton cloth is not bad and cotton yarn inventories have decreased, the Kansai region has decided to continue production cuts. Therefore, the Kantō region decided to be consistent with the Kansai region. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Germany Excludes Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Will Increase Taxes on Japanese Goods for the Second Time</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Urgently Seeks Countermeasures</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The German government, in order to protect its small and medium-sized industries, has increased import taxes on Japanese goods. According to the latest situation, it seems that it will increase taxes for the second time. Previously, because Japanese businesses failed to unite, they did not seek countermeasures, leading to this unfavorable situation, which cannot be ignored. Furthermore, it is still necessary to promote trade in the future. Therefore, there is a keen sense of the need for mutual contact and control among importers and exporters. The Foreign Ministry has also received reports from resident officials. Therefore, it will soon seek countermeasures against Germany. (Nippon Dempo dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Illegal Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway Deadlocked Again</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Reports received here claim that, during a private meeting on Wednesday to discuss the ruble-yen exchange rate, the Manchukuo delegation continued to implement its strategy of obstructing the Tokyo negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. When the Soviet delegation expressed its willingness to discuss determining an exchange rate, the Manchukuo representative immediately sought to avoid reasonable discussion. Ōhashi, the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Manchukuo, first stated that the Manchukuo delegation still insisted on its previous claim, willing to purchase the railway for 50 million yen. They believed that if the price of each gold ruble was converted at a rate of 25 sen, then this amount would be equal to the 200 million gold rubles proposed by the Soviet Union. Kozlovsky replied that this was merely a reiteration of the previous price proposed by Manchukuo in other words and in another way. The Soviet delegation resolutely refused to recognize this as a response to its agreement to discuss the exchange rate and accept it. He further stated that the Soviet delegation believed that Mr. Ōhashi was refusing to discuss the issue in a businesslike manner. Furthermore, in a move to sabotage the negotiations, he declared that such tactics placed the responsibility for disrupting the negotiations entirely on the shoulders of the Manchukuo representative. (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a message announced by the Japanese military, because the puppet state claimed that it would take over the Chinese Eastern Railway by force, the Russian side believes that the situation in the Far East is very urgent. The Russian Military Commissar, Voroshilov, personally visited the Russian border in the Far East to inspect his country's defense forces and hold regular large-scale exercises. Russian military aircraft have frequently crossed the border to demonstrate since August 10, which is a response to the puppet state of Manchuria's military takeover. It is reported that the Russian Military Commissar Voroshilov is still stationed in Khabarovsk, monitoring the development of the situation in the Far East. The Chinese people on the northern Manchurian border are somewhat shaken due to rampant rumors. (China United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Russo-Manchukuo Border Disputes</h3>
<p>(Harbin) According to informed sources, Shi Lüben, the special envoy for foreign affairs of "Manchukuo," has lodged a serious protest with the Russian Consul General Slavutsky, stating that the "Manchukuo" authorities will no longer tolerate the recurrence of events that undermine the sovereignty of "Manchukuo." The protest was accompanied by a booklet containing a list of previous border incidents. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the Russian cross-border incidents in the upper reaches of the Hei River in Heilongjiang Province, the puppet state government, in order to protect the people and maintain national prestige, has lodged a protest. However, the Russian side has shown no sign of remorse and continues to occur. The puppet state's foreign ministry has listed the following facts of the past year. On the 25th, Shi Lüben, the special envoy in northern Manchuria, lodged a serious protest with the Russian Consul General in Harbin: (1) On July 4 of last year, two White Russians were arrested by Russian officials in the Heihe area; (2) On August 5 of the same year, one White Russian was arrested; (3) In December of the same year, a small team of the GPU shot and killed the White Russian tax official Yigunat'ev and eight Manchus; (4) On February 2 of the same year, Russian officials attacked the 80-Wanzi north of Heihe (200 households), killing six people and looting 400 yuan; (5) On April 3 of the same year, the Russian army looted Yabu County; (6) On May 9 of the same year, they looted the county again; (7) On May 23 of the same year, they invaded the county; (8) On May 30 of the same year, the Russian army set fire and looted Mohe County; (9) On July 11 of the same year, Russian officials burned Anluo Village in Mohe County; (10) On August 2 of the same year, Russian officials attacked Huma County, killing four Manchus, etc., totaling seventeen incidents. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) General Voroshilov, the Soviet Russian People's Commissar for Military Affairs, recently traveled to the Manchukuo-Russian border and held a military meeting in Puliqi, near Manzhouli, from the 8th to the 10th to discuss border security issues. He also inspected regular exercises on both sides of the border. Therefore, at a time when there are disputes over the Manchukuo-Russian border and the Northern Railway, General Voroshilov's actions are noteworthy. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Russians have recently spread rumors that "Manchukuo" has relocated the White Russians stationed in the Sanhe District northwest of Hailar for military preparations. Based on letters and oral accounts from refugees, the Harbin Daily published an editorial today refuting these rumors. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Japan Controls Aviation Industry</p>
<h3>Establishes Aviation Investigation Committee</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the recent development of national defense and transportation institutions in Japan, there are plans to establish private airports throughout the country. The government, fearing a lack of control, has decided to establish an Aviation Business Investigation Committee to control all aviation businesses and establish a national aviation network to promote the development of aviation. After a cabinet decision in September, the army, navy, Ministry of Home Affairs, and private sector will select members to carry out the following plans: (1) Encourage the private sector to manufacture light aircraft and establish a passenger and mail aviation network connecting major cities; (2) Build lighthouses and radio stations at major airports and along air routes; (3) Implement contact flights between Japan, Korea, and Manchuria and build large aircraft capable of carrying 50 or 60 passengers; (4) The above plans will be jointly implemented by the Ministry of Communications, the military, and private airlines.

<h3>Does Japan Want to Open Up Its Policy Toward China? Sugimura Will Come to China with Lachemann</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Sugimura Yūtarō, who previously served as Under-Secretary-General of the League of Nations and is currently returning to his country, has been confirmed to be dispatched to various parts of China and Manchuria. Ambassador Sugimura is scheduled to depart Tokyo on September 10 and will spend two and a half months visiting various places in North China, Central China, Guangdong, and Manchuria. Ambassador Sugimura's visit to China is due to Foreign Minister Uchida's desire to open up Japan's policy toward China, and he relies on Ambassador Sugimura's efforts. Therefore, he urged him to take action. Furthermore, Sugimura's visit to China coincides with Lachemann's visit. Therefore, his activities are even more eagerly anticipated.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Further Measures to Punish Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry · Du</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate banditry and protect the interests of the people, the headquarters of the Jiangxi Provincial Government recently drafted regulations for punishing local tyrants and evil gentry. These regulations are to be implemented in bandit suppression areas. The important provisions include: "Those who mistreat civilians to death will be sentenced to death. Those who cause disability will be sentenced to life imprisonment. Those who cause minor injuries will be sentenced to imprisonment for three years or more." There are also provisions that "Those who embezzle public funds of more than 1,000 yuan will be sentenced to death." The intent to care for the common people and suppress the violent and unruly has been carried out to the fullest extent. In times of turmoil and upheaval, everything loses its balance. The desire to devour others is deeply rooted in people's hearts. Strict laws are necessary. However, we still feel that they are not complete enough. In any region, there are traces of local tyrants and evil gentry. Those who rely on their wealth and power and act arrogantly are just ordinary local tyrants and evil gentry. Although the harm they cause is deep, the virus is not severe. Once justice is applied, it is not difficult to curb their abuse. If corrupt officials collude with them, it will become an overwhelming force. The local tyrants use corruption as a talisman, and corruption uses the local tyrants as a tiger's claw. With such mutual reliance and cooperation, they exploit and plunder the people. How can the people not be reduced to dried fish on the market? However, not all local officials are corrupt. The art of collusion will eventually come to an end. The local tyrants will transform themselves to ingratiate themselves with others. Like city foxes and shrine rats, they can form a special force to compete with officials. With the establishment of party branches everywhere today, it is difficult to select and appoint all virtuous people. Therefore, these local tyrants who show their teeth and claws have the opportunity to seek personal gain. Therefore, those who are clearly the incarnation of local tyrants swagger through the streets, brazenly claiming to be members of the party branch. Those who are clearly behaving arbitrarily in the countryside use grand language and parrot the Three Principles of the People. The reason why party rule in various places cannot fully satisfy the people's expectations is largely due to the fault of these disguised local tyrants. The indirect harm they cause is even greater than directly infringing upon the common people. Therefore, we advocate that, in addition to punishing ordinary local tyrants, we should also strictly investigate these seemingly opportunistic elements and resolutely eliminate them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have another concern. The regulations for punishing local tyrants also stipulate the punishment for coercing officials and obstructing government orders. This is naturally aimed at local tyrants. Why should we express doubt? However, given the confusion in the bandit suppression areas and the lack of communication between officials and the people, government orders are often difficult for the people to understand, and the people's suffering cannot be conveyed to the officials. Those who communicate the feelings of the people to the officials and mediate between them are precisely a few upright and experienced gentry. When they point out the gains and losses to the officials, they may offend them with intemperate language. Furthermore, officials who are prone to act on impulse may arbitrarily invoke the regulations and add the charge of coercion and obstruction. In this case, injustice will befall them, and unrest may be incited. The difference of a hair can lead to an error of a thousand miles. The remedy is to establish a consultation mechanism in each locality, composed of several leading figures of great virtue in the county, to assist the officials in their endeavors and to adjust the gains and losses of government orders. At the same time, it is also necessary to send capable officials who are discerning and energetic to secretly investigate and impeach wrongdoing. This will prevent the administration from being biased and achieve harmony between officials and the people.</p>
<p>Since the Jiangxi bandits became rampant, the scourge has spread to Hubei. Anhui, Henan, Fujian, and Guangdong have also been affected, posing a major threat to the country. The areas affected are filled with refugees. How can the desperate choose? The pain of those who are left behind should be deeply sympathized with by those with compassion. The task of recruiting and pacifying them is also the urgent task of those in the government. The military authorities also know that suppression cannot be achieved quickly, and post-war reconstruction is difficult to delay. Therefore, they are gradually using political power as a complement to military force. The drafting of these regulations for punishing local tyrants is also one aspect of the development of political power. If they can strengthen their will, determine their goals, rescue the people from distress, and give the common people a chance to recuperate, we dare to say that the bandit suppression strategy will surely be effective. Otherwise, it will be like trying to stop boiling water by adding fuel to the fire and driving fish into the depths. The consequences will be difficult to control. Those in charge should take this as a deep warning.</p>
<h3>Wheat Agreement Draft Signed</h3>
<p>Wheat-Producing Countries Agree to Limit Exports Within Two Years</p>
<p>And Stipulate the Minimum International Standard Price of Wheat</p>
<p>(London) The wheat agreement to raise prices and control exports was signed here at the Canadian Pavilion at 10:30 PM tonight. Participants included 22 countries: France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Soviet Russia, Yugoslavia, Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States. This agreement does not attempt to fix wheat prices. The price set at 12 gold francs per 100 kilograms (220.46 pounds) is only a standard for importing countries to reduce tariffs. The main provisions are four: (1) Soviet Russia will negotiate with Australia, Canada, and the United States in the hope of agreeing on an agreement to regulate each other's export volumes in the next two years. (2) Wheat exporting countries, including Soviet Russia and the Danubian countries, voluntarily agree that wheat exports in 1934 will not exceed 560,000,000 bushels. However, the amount Soviet Russia can occupy within this total has not been agreed upon, with only an understanding that it will not exceed 50,000,000 bushels. (3) Exporting countries will reduce production by 15% in 1934 and 1935, with the exception of Soviet Russia and the Danubian countries. (4) When wheat prices reach 12 gold francs per 100 kilograms, importing countries will consider reducing tariffs. As a result of signing this agreement, the wheat control plan proposed by the US Department of Agriculture will be slightly modified. (National News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Chairman Bennett Reports (London) Wheat Conference Chairman Bennett, who is also the Prime Minister of Canada, stated at today's meeting that exporting countries have accepted a price of 12 gold francs per 100 kilograms, or 63.08 gold cents per bushel, as the standard for requesting importing countries to revise their import wheat taxes. Exporting countries are willing to have higher prices, but in light of the statements made by other representatives, they are prepared to accept this figure.</p>
<p>French and German Statements Acceptable The French representative said that the French government is prepared to provide evidence to show its intention to reach an agreement based on this price. The German representative made a statement with the same meaning as the French representative.</p>
<p>Russia Hopes to Guarantee Interests The Soviet Russian representative hopes that the implementation of the agreement can guarantee the interests of Soviet Russia, believing that Russia's political and economic needs should be taken into account. (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Representatives of the Danubian countries also stated that their situation is the same as that of Soviet Russia. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>US Department of Agriculture Expresses Satisfaction A Reuters Washington dispatch states that US Department of Agriculture officials are quite pleased with this final decision, but have not commented on it because the clauses added in the last 24 hours need to be analyzed in detail. Unofficial opinions expressed in Washington believe that the London agreement can be fully compatible with the US procedure for regulating wheat production based on automatic domestic control plans.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Signing the Agreement Only This agreement is intended to prevent importing countries from taking advantage of the opportunity of production cuts by exporting countries and developing their domestic policies, hindering the efforts of exporting countries to restore wheat prices to favorable prices for the sake of public interest.</p>
<p>Importing Countries Attach Statement The agreement is attached to a statement from importing countries, which states that the outline of the draft agreement reached on August 21, that is, importing countries agree not to encourage the increase of wheat fields, adopt various possible methods to expand sales, and reduce tariffs when wheat prices are fully stable. This statement also states that importing countries agree, in order to restore normalcy in world wheat trade, the reduction of tariffs must go hand in hand with the reduction of wheat import quotas. This principle must be accepted.</p>
<p>Preparing to Reduce Import Taxes Exporting countries agree that revisions to wheat import quotas in 1933-34 can be made effectively, but importing countries are prepared to adopt effective change measures in 1934-35 if world prices trend upward from the average price of the first six months of 1933. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>US Willing to Reduce Production by 15% (Washington) The US government has formulated a plan to voluntarily reduce wheat production, and the percentage has been set at a 15% reduction in sown area. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>British Market Affected (London) The signing of the world wheat price and supply restriction agreement has had an impact on the Liverpool Grain Exchange. Wheat futures rose nine pence per quarter. Short positions quickly covered. A major Liverpool merchant said, "We don't know how to deal with this situation. If the governments of various countries do not approve the resolutions of this meeting, then any country can disregard it with short notice, rendering this plan useless." (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan and Argentina Negotiating Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Way for Japanese Cotton Textiles to Expand Sales to Argentina</p>
<p>Argentine Government Denies Ordering Warships from Japan</p>
<p>Buenos Aires - This evening, it was learned that Argentina and Japan have been negotiating a reciprocal trade agreement for several days, and it is expected to be signed soon. It would grant both countries valuable trade privileges. According to the proposed terms, Japan, which has always lacked beef, will import large quantities of meat, as well as leather and wool, from Argentina. At the same time, Argentina, a major consumer of cotton cloth, will supply a large part of its market to Japan, and will also grant preferential treatment to Japanese porcelain and various small manufactured goods. It is reported that Japan's beef consumption has been increasing recently, and Japanese merchants are also willing to resell Argentine beef to various parts of the Far East. There are many ships idle here, so shipping companies can also offer low freight rates. However, if this agreement is signed, it may further complicate Argentina's trade relations, because it recently signed a reciprocal agreement with the United Kingdom. If this agreement is established, it will greatly reduce the sales of British cotton cloth in Argentina. Moreover, Argentina is now preparing to start negotiations with the United States on a reciprocal agreement, hoping to promote beef sales in the Atlantic coast of the United States, and in exchange for preferential treatment for American manufactured goods. The United States naturally also hopes to promote cotton cloth sales in Argentina, but due to high labor costs, it may not be able to win in competition with British and Japanese merchants. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - News from Argentina's capital states that Argentina plans to build warships in Japanese shipyards. The Argentine Foreign Minister and Minister of the Navy have recently denied this, saying that Argentina has no intention of expanding its military. This news is completely unfounded.

<p>Peng Fu - The Japanese representatives to the Pacific Association have submitted a draft that includes various suggestions for maintaining peace in the Pacific. The main drafters are Professor Takagi and Mr. Yokota from Tokyo Imperial University. They propose that a conference of the major Pacific powers be held at an appropriate time to clarify the current situation. They also advocate the conclusion of a "Pacific Security Consultation Convention" so that if peace is threatened, the signatory countries can consult with each other to prevent the outbreak of war. The countries that should sign this convention are the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, China, and Soviet Russia. Other countries that wish to participate will not be rejected.

<p>China Strives for Self-Strengthening</p>
<h3>What the Japanese Deeply Fear</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Vossische Zeitung published an article on the Far East issue, stating that "Japan's position in the Far East in the future will be similar to that of the United Kingdom before the European War. To maintain this position, Japan will spare no effort to expand its navy, using its manpower and financial resources. Politically speaking, Japan has disregarded the League of Nations Covenant and can be said to have obtained freedom of action.

Although the details of each differ, their goal is to devalue the dollar in some way in the near term.

<p>Shanghai-Philippines Test Flight Line Survey Completed</p>
<h3>Scheduled to Fly Back to Shanghai on the 1st of Next Month</h3>
<p>Manila Telegraph of the 26th: After Bixby, a representative of Pan American Airways, surveyed the Shanghai-Philippines air route, he is currently preparing a report to be sent to Pan American. He is scheduled to depart on September 1 and fly back to Shanghai. Today, Mr. Bixby declared that the plane will be able to fly south to Zamboanga. According to American news, someone will soon be exploring the South Pacific air route. Although it is not yet certain whether Pan American Airways will be conducting the exploration at that time, it is believed here that even if other companies are paying close attention to the Pacific air route, Pan American will undoubtedly be the first to explore it. It is believed that Mr. Bixby's trip to Zamboanga is sufficient to prove that Pan American may abandon the route from Honolulu via Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam to Manila, and instead take the South Pacific route from Honolulu via Johnson Island, then west past various small islands to the Philippines. This is because some sections of the Guam route are no shorter than 1,200 miles, which is not as good as the South Pacific route, which has countless small islands for stops, which can reduce the amount of gasoline carried by the plane. It is also believed that if the Shanghai-Philippines air route extends south to Zamboanga after Manila, it may not be profitable. Mr. Bixby's visit to that place and detailed survey of the bays within a ten-mile radius that can be used for landing is related to the Pacific air route and is intended to take the South Pacific route. In addition, it is also heard that Pan American has abandoned the idea of taking the northernmost air route to China via Alaska, due to the dangerous weather conditions along the way.</p>

<p>Lindbergh Explores North Atlantic Route</p>
<h3>Recognizes Importance of Shetland Islands</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lerwick, Shetland Islands, 25th: According to Colonel Lindbergh's opinion, the Shetland Islands are located between Europe and America and can serve as an intermediate stop for flights between Europe and America. Their relationship is quite important and cannot be ignored. Today, Colonel Lindbergh drove to Sumburgh Head, the southernmost point of the mainland, to investigate the airfield there. Afterwards, he took a plane and circled for a week, and also inspected the life of the natives in the Bronze Age. Lindbergh paid special attention to the climate records of the area in recent years, and received a lot of materials from the British ship Chilwa, which was docked there. When asked when he would leave the island and what the second destination would be, Lindbergh did not reply, only saying that everything depends on the weather.</p>
<p>Various Groups in Shandong Request Investigation of Personnel Who Advocated Breaching the Dikes</p>
<h3>Also Requesting Retention of One Million in National Taxes for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Provincial Relief Association, Chamber of Commerce, Trade Association, Buddhist Association, Flood Relief Association and other organizations sent a telegram yesterday to Chairman Lin, President Wang, Chairman Chiang, as well as President of the Control Yuan Yu Youren and President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke, requesting that the personnel who advocated breaching the dikes be dismissed and investigated to appease public anger, and requesting that the Shandong Provincial Government retain one million yuan in national taxes to handle post-flood relief. The telegram reads as follows: "Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, President Yu of the Control Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission, and members of the Relief Committee: The breach of the Yellow River in neighboring provinces has caused disaster in western Shandong, affecting more than a dozen counties, with more than two million casualties. Homes have been washed away, and people have lost their homes. Reports from various counties state that the dead have already been swept away by the waves, and the living are climbing trees for support, lacking food and clothing, and their safety is not guaranteed day and night. This is all the poison of the breaches in other provinces, resulting in countless tragic robberies along the river. The river water came suddenly, making the local area unable to prevent it. The solidity of the golden dikes was useless. The area of peace and happiness suddenly became a flooded country. The victims have no one to complain to, and the fish and turtles are pitiful. What is the intention of those who breached the dikes? They are not worthy of being eaten by dogs and pigs. They brazenly use neighboring countries as ditches. How can they face the residents? The culprits have been clamoring among the public, but the authorities have remained silent. Do they regard the fishermen as uncivilized people? Are they willing to use breaching the dikes as a contingency plan? Where are the regulations? Where does the law exist? In the late Qing Dynasty, whenever there was a breach of the Yellow River, those who failed to defend it were first dismissed and arrested to appease public anger. Now, the achievements of river management in various provinces are obvious to all. When the Yellow River floods, they are at a loss and openly send people to breach the dikes, causing the Yellow River to seize the Huai River's course, making western Shandong the tail end. Their intentions and actions are in line with the bandit Li Zicheng's approach of breaching the river to flood Kaifeng. Allowing such heinous and wicked culprits who endanger the country and harm the people to roam free outside the law, how can we talk about river works? How can we face the victims? How can we warn the future? How can we show the world? We should request the government to issue a clear order to dismiss and investigate the personnel who advocated breaching the dikes, to correct official corruption and comfort the victims, and to investigate and punish the officials responsible for river management who have failed in their duties, to show the government's sincerity in mending the fold after the sheep is lost and in distinguishing between good and evil. It is especially important to remember that the victims have suffered unexpected disasters. We humbly request that disaster relief funds be dispatched quickly to provide assistance. Please issue a clear order to the Shandong Provincial Government to temporarily allow the borrowing of one million yuan from the national tax revenue, including salt tax and tobacco and alcohol items, to quickly handle post-flood relief. We are extremely urgent in awaiting orders. Respectfully printed by representatives of the Shandong disaster victims: Zhao Xinru, Gu Zhujiu, He Supu of the Provincial Relief Association, Zhang Shuheng, He Shaojiang of the Chamber of Commerce, Shi Shaoxian, Miao Cun, Feng Nianlu of the Trade Association, Sha Yuebo, Lao Fuquan of the Buddhist Association, Han Luxiang, Zhu Jinggu, Wang Ziyu of the Western Shandong Flood Relief Association, and others.

<p>A Travelogue of Chahar and Suiyuan</p>
<p>Vehicles on the PingSui Railway are Scarce and Passengers are Crowded</p>
<p>The Garrison at Qinglong Bridge Has Not Been Withdrawn, But Inspections Have Been Relaxed</p>
<p>The Journey from Zhangjiakou to Datong Takes Twelve Hours</p>
<p>A Certain Senior Military Officer Talks About the Bravery of Song's Army</p>
<p>Special Telegram from Suiyuan: During the tense situation in Chahar, the PingSui Railway was once interrupted. Now that Feng Yuxiang has left Chahar for Shandong and the Chahar issue has been resolved, the reporter is making a trip to Chahar and Suiyuan to investigate the truth about the Chahar issue and the situation in the Northwest. I departed from Ping on the 13th, first to Zhangjiakou, stayed for two days, then went to Datong to inspect, and then came to Suiyuan from Datong, arriving last night. The situation along the way is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>When the reporter departed from Ping, the PingSui Railway had just been restored. Vehicles were scarce, passengers were crowded, and the journey was slow, with many delays. Between Ping and Zhang, inspections were slightly relaxed, and pedestrians had fewer scruples. However, the tracks were in disrepair and the vehicles were dilapidated. Being in the car was like riding a small boat into the sea, and I felt seasick. The bad state of the road administration can be imagined. Because of many events over the years, some have been destroyed, but no one has reorganized them.</p>
<p>At noon on the 13th, I boarded the train at Xizhimen, Beijing, and arrived at Nankou in three hours, which is the important gateway to the south of Juyongguan, hence the name. During the battles of the 15th year of the Republic, the Feng army and the Northwest army fought here, lasting half a year, which was a famous battle in the history of the Republic of China. After the war, the reporter visited the battlefield and found that the defense line was tens of miles long, and the trenches were meticulous and the fortifications were solid, which was the best of its time. Now, however, it is overgrown with weeds, and there is no trace of the battle. Only the towering monument to the fallen soldiers remains, leaving a scar on the bloody history of the civil war. When the train arrived at Nankou, it turned into the mountain road and changed to a large mountain train head, which was pushed up from the rear of the train and spiraled along the mountain road. I only saw thousands of mountains overlapping, with no end in sight. Crossing several mountains and passing through three or four caves, I arrived at Qinglong Bridge. When the Chahar situation was tense, the central armored train stayed here, heavily guarded, and inspected passengers. Now, although the soldiers have not been withdrawn, the inspection has been relaxed. The tracks here, due to the steep terrain, fold and go south, with the tracks in a Y shape, commonly known as the Y track. The direction of the vehicles also changes accordingly, making the tail the head, and continuing its work of climbing over mountains. Along the way, the mountains are high and the roads are dangerous. The Great Wall stands straight against the mountains, sometimes hidden and sometimes visible, like a divine dragon. The pass is majestic and naturally formed, truly one man guarding the pass, ten thousand men cannot pass. However, from here to the east, directly to Yuguan, the danger of the Great Wall remains the same, but the color of the rivers and mountains has changed early. Why is the natural barrier not enough to rely on? The train left Juyong and the terrain was slightly flatter, directly to Kangzhuang, which is the entrance to Kangzhuang Avenue, and went northwest for dozens of miles to Huailai. The city is surrounded by mountains, and the city walls stand on the top of the mountains, forming a natural fortress. When Pang Bingxun's troops entered Chahar, they once set up headquarters here to command various armies, and then from here to Shacheng. Now, it has been moved to Xuanhua, and the defense area is left to Feng Qinzai's troops. From Huailai to the northwest, passing through Shacheng, Xiahuayuan, Xinzhuangzi, and other places, these areas all became important areas during the period of resolving the Chahar issue. There are still relics of the fortifications along the road, and it is conceivable that the confrontation between the two sides was tense, with swords drawn and bows ready. It is still vivid in my mind. I arrived in Xuanhua at about eight o'clock in the evening. There are quite a few troops stationed in Xuanhua, in addition to Pang Bingxun's troops, as well as a part of Guan Linzheng's 25th Division, and Liu Zhendong's volunteer army of more than 2,000 people. The train stopped for half an hour and then headed west, arriving in Zhangjiakou when the clock struck ten. Zhangjiakou is the center of the Chahar provincial coup. I stayed in Zhang for two days and made some investigations.</p>
<p>At midnight on the 15th, I took a train from Zhangjiakou to continue westward, heading to Datong. From Zhangjiakou to Datong is only more than 300 miles, and there is no obstruction along the way, but it took as long as twelve hours, until twelve o'clock the next afternoon before arriving. The slowness of the train is truly strange. Datong is an important town in northern Shanxi, and also a famous scenic area in Shuofang. The Nine Dragon Stele and the Yungang Grottoes are ancient sites there. I stayed for two days,</p>
<p>and took a leisurely tour.</p>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. on the 18th, I boarded a train in Datong and traveled 90 miles, passing Fengzhen, and entered Suiyuan territory. Along the way, the mountains and hills are continuous and the grasslands are lush, which is a natural area for farming and animal husbandry. Unfortunately, due to inconvenient transportation and a sparse population, goods are abandoned on the ground and left to waste. After 3:00 p.m., I passed Zhuozishan. The train travels in the mountains, surrounded by mountains, which is a scenic spot. This mountain is a famous place outside the Great Wall, and ancient poems and essays praise it. Datong to Suiyuan is about 500 miles, and Zhuozishan is about halfway there. The train traveled for about six hours and arrived in Suiyuan. There was thunder and rain, so I took a short rest in the city.</p>
<p>On this trip to the west, I met a senior general who fought at Xifengkou in the same car. According to him, after the September 18th Incident, the three northeastern provinces fell into enemy hands. Song Zheyuan and Sun Dianying requested to send troops to recover the lost territory, advancing troops from Rehe, one route out of Chaoyang, and the other route out of Kailu, to meet in Shenyang. At that time, the national spirit in the Northeast was very strong. Even if they could not recover all the lost territory in one fell swoop, they could greatly frustrate the enemy's offensive. But it was not realized. Later, when the Japanese army plotted Rehe, Song again requested to enter Rehe and serve as the vanguard. Song served as the governor of Rehe in the 14th year of the Republic, and was familiar with the geography. Defending Rehe with him might not have been so unsavory. Even after Chengde fell and the Northeast Army fled into the Great Wall, they only received orders to reinforce the defense of Xifengkou. When they were about to advance, the Northeast Army was retreating. Everyone asked Song's troops what army they were and what they were going to do. They replied that they were the 29th Army and were going to resist the Japanese. The hearers all said that the enemy's forces were fierce, and not to mention the 29th Army, even the 99th Army would be difficult to resist. Song's troops heard this, scoffed, and marched 120 miles in a hurry to encounter the enemy. The soldiers were exhausted and there were no fortifications. They fought bravely and bloodily. Although they frustrated the enemy's offensive, they suffered more than 1,200 casualties. Later, the large army continued to arrive, all with the determination to fight the enemy to the death. After discussing with each other, they decided that their weapons were not as good as the enemy's. Rather than defending for a long time and being wounded, it would be better to go to the enemy and die on the battlefield. They rushed out from Panjiakou, Dongjiakou, and other places, killing into the enemy's line. The soldiers had a determination to die, and one soldier was equal to a hundred. They captured many enemies and the enemy's courage was chilled. After this battle, the enemy did not dare to look at them directly. Several times they took advantage of the emptiness to attack, but our army's actions were swift and agile, traveling 200 miles a day, responding as they came, and ultimately failed to succeed. After two months of stalemate, the Japanese army repeatedly attacked without success, and had great doubts. First, they did not know where the main force of Song's troops was. When they used planes to scout, they only saw a small number of troops stationed there. But when they attacked, they felt that the troops were strong and impregnable. Where was the main force? They never knew. Second, they did not know how many troops Song had. Song's defense line was very long, but no matter where the Japanese army attacked, there were strong troops responding, which could not be done with a small number of troops. As a result, the Japanese army felt that they did not know how many soldiers Song had. In fact, Song's troops on the front line only numbered tens of thousands, but they were used flexibly. Troops are valued for their quality, not their quantity. There is a reason for this. Now the Japanese army often uses Song's troops as a target for research, saying that Song's troops' weapons are not as good as the Japanese army's, and the rear transport is extremely inconvenient. What is the way to victory? It is worth studying. (Reached on August 19)</p>

<h3>Bloody Incident Occurs in Shi Wu Tu</h3>
<p>Wang Binggen, a villager from Shiwu Tu outside the North Gate, married Yin Quying. The relationship between the couple was initially harmonious, but recently, due to Wang Binggen's difficult livelihood, his wife had an affair with Gu Xiaodi. After Wang discovered this, he agreed to cede his wife, negotiating compensation of 150 yuan. After the contract was signed, Wang Binggen did not receive the money. Gao took it away in the middle. Wang regretted the agreement because of the price. Gu Xiaodi was unwilling to lose both his person and his money. Gu's friend Gu Songyuan and others secretly carried kitchen knives and went to Wang Binggen's house to make trouble last night. They disagreed with each other. Wang Binggen's shoulder was stabbed with a knife, and blood flowed like a column. The perpetrators fled one after another. It is said that this matter still needs to be negotiated.</p>

<h3>Farmers Burn Bee Farm</h3>
<p>Zhang Ziqing and others from Zhangjiazhai, Shenzhuang, founded the Zhoupu Bee Company, which has been in business for several years. Its bee farm is located near the house, with more than 150 boxes of bees. Recently, some busybodies spread rumors that the bees were flying into the fields, which was harmful to plants. The general farmers were suspicious. Unfortunately, there was heavy rain, and many of the yellow flowers that had opened in the fields and cotton fields fell off, which made them believe that it was caused by bee damage. They repeatedly negotiated with the farm and requested that the bee farm be moved elsewhere, but permission was not granted. The farmers gathered many people the night before last and suddenly burned all the beehives on the farm. The farm staff immediately flew to the Zhoupu Security Corps to report and request that the perpetrators be investigated. The corps immediately sent many corps soldiers to rush to the place, but they saw that there were thousands of farmers gathered, and the situation was tense. If they approached to investigate and arrest them, conflicts would inevitably occur, so they immediately returned to the corps to report. It is heard that the company's loss this time is estimated at more than 4,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>On-site Examination of the Case of Murdering One's Husband</h3>
<p>The case of Gu Zhang, a rural woman from Shangtang Village, Eighth District (Huai Xia City), colluding with her lover Sun Awu and her adoptive father Jin Enrong (i.e., Jin Kuilin) to murder her own husband, Gu Yinsheng, has been reported in this newspaper. At 7:30 a.m. yesterday (25th), Prosecutor Ren Guanghai of the County Court, along with a clerk, an inspector, and bailiffs, and escorting the adulterous woman Gu Zhang, took a pre-hired boat and were towed downstream by a Changshu ship. They arrived in the countryside at about 11:00 a.m. Prosecutor Ren and others went ashore and examined the scene of the crime at Gu Yunsheng's home. They then questioned Gu Zhang. According to her confession, Gu Yinsheng was killed by Sun Awu, Jin Enrong initiated the idea, and took the first action, and the body was dragged out from the gate. After the questioning, Prosecutor Ren went to the burial ground, ascended the public case, and again summoned Gu Zhang and Tupo Zhongying for questioning. He then instructed the Inspector Wang to conduct an on-site examination as required. The examination revealed two rope marks on the back of the deceased, one rope mark on the waist, two rope marks on the arms, one cloth strip mark on the left and right legs, and three hemp rope marks on the left and right hands, all of which were tied after death. There was a scratch on the neck, a thumbprint on the right side of the throat, and two or three finger marks on the face. The skin of the whole body was changed and the epidermis was peeled off. Both hands were bent forward and tied together. The urine and both eyes had rotted. It was confirmed that he had been strangled to death before his death. After the examination, he instructed the corpse's family to prepare a coffin for burial, and instructed Tupo to guard the two murder stones and the rope and cloth strips used to tie the corpse, which he ordered to be sent to the court the next day. They then returned by the original boat, arriving at the hospital at 8:20 p.m. As for the important criminal Jin Enrong, he was also transferred from the Public Security Bureau to the County Court yesterday (26th). After Prosecutor Ren opened the court for interrogation, Jin flatly denied that he had plotted to kill Gu Yinsheng. As a result, the court ordered him to be detained, pending the arrival of Sun and Gu for confrontation before further review.</p>

Recently, the victim received a letter from the kidnappers demanding 50,000 yuan as a condition for the safe return of the child. The Provincial Public Security Bureau intensified the investigation and subsequently apprehended two female suspects, Guo Qinxian and Liu Asan, who confessed to participating in the conspiracy. They also identified Hong Quanmao, Jiang Jianqiu, Zhou Xin, Chen Zhaolin, Xue Wanli, and others as the kidnappers in the case.

<h3>Violent Gale Strikes Ningbo</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th) at 4:30 PM, Ningbo was suddenly hit by heavy rain, followed by a violent gale, which subsided after half an hour. More than 30 utility poles were blown down in the area from Xiancang Gate to North Gate. Many utility poles in the western and southern parts of the city were also blown down, causing the entire city to be without electricity. Last night, both inside and outside the city walls, it became a world of darkness. The Ningbo Public Security Bureau and the patrol brigades of various sub-bureaus, considering the vital importance of public safety, dispatched all personnel to patrol and strengthen security. The electric company, due to the excessive number of utility poles blown down, will be unable to restore power for four to five days.</p>

Key figures from the Central Government are making preparations to welcome him in Shanghai. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan; Ma Chaojun and Fu Rulin, members of the Legislative Yuan; Wang Kemin, Director of the Finance Department of the North China Political Affairs Reorganization Committee; and others arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. Zhu Jiahe, Minister of Communications; Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; and Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health, also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing last night. Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways; Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways; and Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by train on the night of the 28th. Huang Fu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, and Ma Zhanshan, the anti-Japanese hero, are also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hangzhou on the 28th. It is also known that Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, will also come to Shanghai to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke's Remarks Upon Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>General Feng Will Enter the Capital to Take on Important Central Positions</p>
<p>Negotiations Underway to Obtain Feng's Consent Regarding His Title</p>
<p>Madam Sun Will Return to Her Hometown on the 30th</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, along with Ma Chaojun and Fu Rulin, members of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by night train at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Our reporter interviewed Mr. Sun at his residence yesterday and recorded his remarks as follows:</p>
<p>(Feng Can Come to the Capital But Does Not Want to Stay Long) Mr. Sun first stated that he had a pleasant and productive meeting with Mr. Feng Huanzhang in Taishan. Feng was sincere in his attitude and indicated that he could visit the capital in the short term, but he does not wish to stay in the capital for long, as he is unaccustomed to city life. Regarding Feng's title, the Central Government intends to appoint him as Army Inspector or Water Conservancy Director, and they are currently seeking Feng's consent. Once Feng himself decides on which position he prefers, the official order will be issued. Ma Chaojun and Fu Rulin previously went to Lushan to meet with Chairman Chiang to discuss this matter, so there is no need for me to fly to Jiangxi again for the time being.</p>
<p>(No Change in Diplomatic Policy) Regarding the rumors widely spread by the Japanese side that our diplomatic policy has undergone a change, this can be disproven by the fact that Minister Song will not disembark in Japan on this trip. Although Wang Jingwei has assumed the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs concurrently, there is no intention to change the diplomatic policy for the time being. As for the claim that a secret loan of 80 million yuan has been made to Japan, not only does Japan not have the financial capacity for this, but our country is also unable to repay its previous Japanese debts, let alone take out another loan. Therefore, this kind of rumor is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>(Luo Wenkan's Inspection Consolidates the Border)</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Luo Wenkan's current inspection of Xinjiang is Luo's own idea. When the Central Government sent Huang Musong to Xinjiang, before his trip materialized, Luo already had this intention. However, at that time, due to the ceasefire in North China, he could not spare the time, and President Wang also believed that the diplomatic situation was tense and that he could not be without someone in charge, so he did not agree to Luo's trip, and the matter was dropped. Recently, because the diplomatic situation has come to an end, Luo made this request again, and the Central Government reluctantly approved it, in order to inspect the border situation and consolidate national defense.</p>
<p>(The Fifth National Congress Will Be Convened as Scheduled)</p>
<p>The Central Government is actively preparing for the Fifth National Congress. The Southwest opposes the convening of the congress, arguing that previous resolutions have not been fully implemented, and that there is no need to convene a congress in the future. This reason is not only unreasonable, but even ordinary organizations and institutions would not have such a superficial view, let alone this congress being the highest organ of the Party and the country. If the Guangdong Committee is dissatisfied with the failure to implement previous resolutions, it can take this opportunity to raise questions at the congress. If it only expresses dissatisfaction with the Central Government in the past, it may also submit its opinions to the congress for public discussion. Why oppose the convening of the congress? As for the claim that the Guangdong Province will convene another congress separately, it is just an attempt by a few people, and in reality, it is impossible. Some advocate that the congress should not be held in the capital, but in another location, but everyone knows that this is stipulated by the Party Constitution. If one does not recognize Nanjing as the capital, then it is clear that one is violating the Party Constitution.</p>
<p>(Staying in Shanghai to Wait for Song, Not Going to Guangdong for the Time Being) Mr. Sun finally stated that he came to Shanghai to take a break during the week and plans to stay in Shanghai to meet with Minister Song Ziwen before returning to Nanjing. As for the rumors that he will be going to Guangdong, they are inaccurate, and he has no intention of going south for the time being. According to sources close to Mr. Sun, Sun's mother, Madam Lu, is scheduled to return to her hometown on the 30th of this month, accompanied by Sun's son, traveling south by ship.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Result of This Trip to Jiangxi to Meet Chiang Was Very Good</p>
<p>Madam Kong, Song Ailing, and Others Returned Together</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, the governor of the Central Bank, was invited by Chiang Kai-shek, chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, to travel by plane from Shanghai to Xun on Thursday of last week, where he then proceeded to Lushan to meet with Chiang to discuss important issues such as the Central Government's finances, the distribution of American cotton and wheat, and the rehabilitation of North China. A satisfactory conclusion was reached, and Kong left the mountain at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, transferring to Chiang Kai-shek's personal Stinson aircraft in Jiujiang. He departed from Xun at 8:00 AM and arrived in Nanjing at 12:00 PM, landing at Minggugong for a midday meal. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, he boarded the same plane to fly to Shanghai, arriving safely at Hongqiao Airport at 4:30 PM. Kong and his entourage disembarked and returned directly to their private residence by car. The Sixth District Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau specially dispatched a squad of police officers to maintain order at the scene. Those who returned to Shanghai with Kong yesterday included his wife, Madame Song Ailing, their second daughter, Lingjun, their fourth son, Lingyi, and Secretary Tan and his bodyguards, totaling six people. After receiving the news, reporters from the Xinxin News Agency immediately drove to West Adams Road to visit and inquire about the details of this trip to Jiangxi. It was reported by his staff that the results of Kong's trip were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Remarks Upon Returning to Shanghai</p>
<h3>The Land Value Tax Must Be Collected, and the House Tax on Beisichuan Road Must Also Be Collected</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng, who recently went to Nanjing on official business to meet with Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei and report on the city's recent municipal facilities, has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai by train at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. At 10:30 AM, he met with reporters from various newspapers at the city government and made the following remarks regarding the city government's proposed land value tax and the collection of house tax on the encroached section of Beisichuan Road:</p>
<p>(Collecting Land Value Tax)</p>
<p>Wu first stated that the collection of the land value tax was a result of long-term consideration and planning, so it must be implemented. The reasons are as follows: 1. The tax burden on the people throughout the country is lightest in Shanghai, especially for the citizens in the urban area. According to the obligations of citizens to the country, they must not hesitate or shirk their responsibilities.</p>
<p>(Average Burden)</p>
<p>2. In the urban area, even in the residential area, the land value in Nanshi and Zhabei ranges from several thousand taels to more than ten thousand taels per mu, which is very different from the land value in the rural areas of Wusong, Jiangwan, Caohejing, and Hongqiao Town, which ranges from two to three hundred yuan to four to five hundred yuan per mu. The rental income in Nanshi and Zhabei is many times higher than the crop yields in Wusong, Jiangwan, and other places, but the taxes levied on houses, land, and fields in the past were almost the same, which is extremely unfair.</p>
<p>(Taxing the Rich More)</p>
<p>The Chinese rural economy is deteriorating, which is also due to the excessive burden on farmers. As for the landlords' so-called burden of paying house tax, it should be noted that the house tax is mainly used for police affairs. In short, those who oppose it can continue to make excuses, but I dare to say frankly that taxes should be levied more on the rich and not harshly demanded from the poor. Therefore, the collection of the land value tax must not be delayed, and there is no possibility of delay. The city's revenue should be based on the principle of living within one's means. What is necessary for municipal construction must be implemented resolutely and as soon as possible, because it is of a dead nature rather than a living one. After the city government completes the preparatory work, it will immediately begin to collect the tax from the residential area according to law, with an estimated annual income of more than one million yuan, which will be used entirely for municipal construction.</p>
<p>(House Tax Must Be Collected)</p>
<p>Wu continued that the house tax on the encroached section of Beisichuan Road must not be accommodated again and must be strictly enforced according to law. The merchants in the area want to request a delay in the collection again, which is unreasonable. They make excuses that the area is encroached and want to wait until the negotiations are completed before starting the collection, which is even more insane. They are Chinese people living on Chinese land. Even for concessions, concessions are on other people's land and will still be our country's territory when the term expires. Therefore, its sacred judicial power is still in our hands, and the First and Second Special District Courts are established. It is only that part of the prosecutorial power is subject to certain restrictions. Now they are not living in a concession but in an encroached area in a purely Chinese area, enjoying the benefits of municipal facilities. How can they not have the obligation to pay taxes? The city government should persuade them on one hand and strictly enforce the collection on the other hand.</p>
<h3>A Citywide Market Strike Occurred in Luodian Yesterday</h3>
<p>The District Chief Forbids the Employment of Specialists to Collect Debts</p>
<p>The Business Community Adopts Passive Resistance</p>
<p>A citywide market strike suddenly broke out in Luodian Town in Baoshan County yesterday. The situation is detailed below:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike Luodian Town is the first major town on the entire Hutai Road. Its surrounding villages are as far as six or seven li, more than ten li, or even twenty li away. Therefore, the market is more prosperous than Liuhe Town in Taicang County. The debts owed to the shops are not only inconvenient to collect due to the long distance, but there are also stubborn and impoverished debtors who have been in arrears for three to five years or even six to seven years. Therefore, shops in the town have the practice of hiring specialists to collect debts in the villages. Recently, the Fourth District Affairs Conference decided to prohibit shops from hiring opium addicts and beggars to collect debts and presented it to the county government for approval. Notices were issued to prohibit this. Shops were panicked because they would have no way to collect debts in the future. The afternoon before yesterday, at around 3:00 PM, they went to the town's chamber of commerce to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures. They dispersed at 2:00 AM without any results. As a result, yesterday, the entire town went on strike.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike After the town went on strike, it issued the reasons for the strike, stating that a market strike is originally a passive resistance method. Otherwise, who would dare to act rashly and sacrifice themselves? This time, Wang Qingshou, the district chief of the Fourth District Office of the town, arbitrarily based his proposal on the vague proposals of the village chiefs in the District Affairs Conference and presented it to the county government for instructions. There was no consultation beforehand and no guarantee afterward. It provides convenient opportunities for debtors and makes it impossible for creditors to collect debts. Therefore, the government is using its power to oppress the business community, and the business community will not accept it. Since receiving the county government's instructions, the merchants have felt a significant obstruction and impact on the collection of debts. When the general meeting was held yesterday, District Chief Wang was respectfully invited to attend and provide guidance on rescue measures. However, he continued to perfunctorily answer, and his tone implied that the merchants were indiscriminately lending debts, resulting in uncollectible debts. After deliberating for half the night, there was no result, so they finally decided on this last resort of a market strike. The following is a list of what the merchants are demanding:</p>
<p>Merchants' Demands 1. The resolution passed by the District Affairs Conference, which restricts merchants from hiring people to collect debts, should be completely overturned, and the county government should be requested to withdraw its order. 2. None of the dozens of village chiefs in each village is not in arrears with the shops (only one or two are not in arrears). This time, the village chiefs sponsored this resolution for their own selfish purposes. It is now necessary to order each of the village chiefs to first pay off all the debts to the shops in full as an example, otherwise, these stubborn village chiefs should be removed. 3. Sun Yingfeng, assistant to the Fourth District Office, is just a young man with no knowledge or skills and should be dismissed. 4. The district office itself has been in arrears with the shops for years and has never paid them back. This time, it is also requested to pay them back in full to avoid default. The above points are the common demands of the merchants of the entire town.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce's Submission Wang Daxun, acting chairman of the Luodian Chamber of Commerce, submitted a document to the county government yesterday, requesting an urgent telegram report. The document states: According to the instructions of your government, Wang Qingtao, the district chief of the Fourth District, presented a request to ban merchants from collecting debts, etc. While this was being reviewed and forwarded, the entire town's merchants came to the association to hold a meeting, stating that District Chief Wang not only does not prohibit the villagers from buying on credit but also prohibits the merchants from collecting debts and falsely accuses them of hiring beggars and opium addicts to prohibit them from collecting debts, which is tantamount to condemning the merchants to death. It is requested that District Chief Wang consider the difficulties of the merchants and withdraw the original report. District Chief Wang then stated that he was not present at the District Affairs Conference at the time and was not familiar with the details of the case. He will meet with the county magistrate to discuss a solution. The merchants were not satisfied with the district chief's vague words, so they decided to suspend business and wait for orders. In an instant, the entire town went on strike. This case was revived from an old case of the District Affairs Conference, which led to the repeat of the evil drama of September 18, 1931. The district chief regretted not knowing the details, and the association was ashamed that it could not mediate. They are now doing their best to persuade them together with the Public Security Bureau, but it has no effect. It is urgently reported to County Magistrate Jin of Baoshan County for review and approval, and a suitable person should be sent to Luodian to guide them, which is extremely urgent. Respectfully presented.</p>
<p>Post-Strike Inspection After learning of the above situation, the reporter went to inspect the entire town and saw that each shop had posted slogans condemning the District Affairs Conference for oppressing the merchants and forcing them to go on strike. There were also various red and green slogans at other bridgeheads and alleys, with very激烈 words omitted. All the shops, including food shops, were closed, which was even quieter than the Lunar New Year. When returning to Shanghai, it was also heard that the county government had sent Zhang Qian, the chief of the Public Security Section, Chen Jiamo, a member of the County Party Department Reorganization Committee, and Liu Shouquan, a party affairs member, to Luodian to mediate.</p>
<h3>The Collection of House Tax on Beisichuan Road Has Been Successfully Resolved</h3>
<p>House Tax Will Still Be Collected Starting This Autumn</p>
<p>The City Government Approves the Allocation of 10,000 Yuan in Relief Funds</p>
<p>The city government had previously announced that the house tax on the encroached section of Beisichuan Road would be collected starting this autumn. The merchants in the area requested a delay in implementation due to the slow recovery after the war, which has not been resolved. Recently, Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, came forward to mediate and decided on three measures: 1. The house tax will be collected starting this autumn. 2. The city government will allocate 10,000 yuan from the house tax to serve as war relief funds for the area. 3. The distribution of the relief funds will be subject to the opinions of the citizens of the area and will be implemented with the approval of the city government. The city government has approved it, and the citizens have expressed satisfaction, and the case has been successfully resolved.</p>
<h3>Labor Strikes at British and American Factories Intensify Yesterday</h3>
<p>After 8,000 workers at the old and new British and American factories in Pudong launched a full-scale work stoppage two days ago, the new factory closed its back door yesterday, refusing to allow female workers to enter the factory. Workers at the third factory on Taopeng Road intend to join the strike, and the factory has sent guards to prevent this. More than 20 labor unions in Pudong will meet to provide assistance, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<p>The Anti-War Association Contacts Meeting Venues After Malais Returns to Shanghai</p>
<h3>A Heartfelt Discussion on Impressions of Traveling in Japan</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Lord Marley, Chairman of the World Anti-War Association and former Under-Secretary of State for War of the United Kingdom, recently arrived in Shanghai with five representatives from the European Anti-War Association. They then went to Japan with Dr. D. Marteau, the French representative, hoping that Japan would send a representative to the association to eliminate the clouds of war in the world. Unexpectedly, as soon as Mr. Marley arrived in Kobe, he was monitored by the Japanese military police authorities and questioned for four hours. He was also forbidden to meet with Army Minister Araki and the British consuls in Japan, and was restricted to returning to Shanghai on the same day. During the questioning, Kobe frequently notified Tokyo by telephone for further questioning. Although they were not threatened, they were overwhelmed by the harassment. The two quietly returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and checked into the Cathay Hotel. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency specifically inquired about the news from the association yesterday, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Japanese Interrogation) According to Mr. Marley, he arrived in Kobe on August 21. At that time, a large number of representatives from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, military police, authorities, and the press were talking to each other. From 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., questioners came continuously. During the questioning, Mr. Marley said that he was not a communist. Communism could be practiced in one country, but not in another, depending on the circumstances. The purpose of his visit to Japan was to ask the British Embassy to request the Japanese authorities and Army Minister Araki to allow</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Japanese representatives to attend the Anti-War Association. At that time, the Japanese told him that there was a Japanese person who could sympathize with the Anti-War Association, named Kanju Kato, who currently lives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Strict Search of Luggage)</p>
<p>Mr. Marley was never able to speak with the British consuls in Japan. Most of the representatives from the industrial and labor sectors who came to see him were also prohibited. Several books left in his suitcase were mostly detained. One of them was "Tanaka's Positive Manchurian Invasion Memorial," which Mr. Marley had prepared for the Anti-War Association for reference, and was also searched and taken away.</p>
<p>(Actively Preparing for War) Mr. Marley made an affirmative statement about the situation of actively preparing for war. He said, "The Japanese authorities are afraid of us entering the country because they know the importance and influence of the anti-war movement. Although they are now actively preparing for war, they also have to</p>
<p>hesitate. Moreover, their industry is already very developed, but the supply of raw materials is lacking, and the domestic market is too small, so the national situation is extremely turbulent and tense. It is expected that they will seek a way out through war." Mr. Marley also said that Japan is preparing for war, so it is very xenophobic, especially towards the British and Americans. Once they enter the country, they will be strictly monitored. Therefore, opposing imperialism and war is a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>(Foreign Newspaper Records) The Great American Evening News said that Lord Marley, the leader of the Anti-War Conference representatives, visited Mr. Peel, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Mr. Fessenden, the President, today (26th). Afterwards, according to Mr. Marley, the visit today was of a social nature, just an ordinary conversation. According to his impression, the attitude of the Director-General of the Municipal Council towards the purpose of the association can be said to be completely without prejudice. He told Mr. Peel that the representatives had not yet decided on the matter of requesting a meeting in the Public Concession, because the place of the meeting could not be decided until the relevant factors, such as the attitude of the Chinese government towards the meeting, the number of participants, and the general nature of the meeting, had been considered again. Mr. Marley said that he would visit the French Consul-General and the Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Tiecheng, at the beginning of next week, or possibly on Monday, but this visit would be of the same nature as today's visit to Mr. Peel. Mr. Marley continued that Mr. Peel had stated that the Municipal Council sympathized with the meeting on the one hand, but on the other hand, the possibility of disturbances must also be considered. Finally, he thanked Mr. Peel for the safety of the representatives by the Municipal Council. According to reports, after Mr. Marley returned to Shanghai from Japan yesterday, the Public Concession Police Department immediately granted his request and sent two detectives for special protection. As for the representatives attending, it is reported that Qilu University in Jinan recently requested to send a representative to the meeting, and the British representative, Hamilton, replied with a welcome telegram.</p>
<p>French Congressman Sériès Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Madame Martel, Wife of the French Ambassador to Japan, Also Arrives</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News said that French Congressman Sériès, who is highly regarded in the National Assembly, has come to the Far East for a tour. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday (25th) on the Blue Funnel Line's Aeneas steamer. Mr. Sériès has served as Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs twice and assisted the late Foreign Minister Briand at the League of Nations in Geneva for five years. He has also been elected as a member of parliament four times and has been in the National Assembly for fourteen years. This time, during his leisure time, he is inspecting the situation in the Far East. After leaving Shanghai, he will go to Vietnam. Madame Martel, wife of the French Ambassador to Japan, also came to Shanghai on the same ship yesterday. When Mr. Martel was the French Minister to China, he had a villa in Peiping. He has now been transferred by the French government to the post of High Commissioner of Assynia, so the Countess will travel to Peiping in a few days, and then go to Assynia.</p>
<p>Idle Talk from a Returning Guest from Youlin</p>
<h3>The Righteous Army in Eastern Jilin Recovers Bin County</h3>
<p>According to the Northeast News Agency, a certain gentleman from Jilin entered the customs from Jilin and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Northeast News Agency interviewed him at his hotel. According to him, the recovery of Bin County by the Jilin Righteous Army and its activities are very detailed. The gentleman said that on the 9th of this month, Bin County was recovered by Sun Zhaoyang, the leader of the Righteous Army. More than 30 Japanese soldiers were killed, 17 were captured, and one enemy commander, Captain Sasaki Yoshi, was killed. Two mortars, four machine guns, and a lot of rifles and bullets were seized. The Japanese army retreated to the Feketu River, 80 li west of Bin County, to defend, and there is no sign of a counterattack. The battle lasted for two days and nights, and the street fighting lasted for more than ten hours. About 170 members of the Righteous Army and about 30 civilians died. During the street fighting, Japanese aircraft assisted in the battle, destroying the county town with artillery fire. At the same time, the Righteous Army to the east of Bin County successively recovered Mishan, Shiqing, and Fujin were also recovered once. Weizhu River is also said to have been recovered. Yanshou is under siege. It is said that the Righteous Army plans to capture Jilin City before this year's September 18th Incident. The seventh and eighth districts of Jilin City have been occupied by the Righteous Army, with about 10,000 people, and the momentum is very strong. It is also reported that Wuchang County has been occupied by Yang Bingzao. The Ha-Sui Line has long been blocked.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Mediates the Post Office Layoff Dispute</p>
<h3>Layoffs Changed to Retirement with Two Months' Salary</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union opposed the postal authorities' decision to forcibly lay off more than 30 senior personnel nationwide from September 1st this year, which violated the Postal Regulations, causing opposition from postal workers in various places. It is now learned that in order to avoid the expansion of the situation, the Ministry of Communications has accepted the principle and proposed two mediation methods: 1) Change the layoffs to voluntary retirement; 2) Give another month's salary. After receiving the telegram from the Ministry, the two associations convened a joint meeting of all executive supervisors yesterday. First, Chairman Zhang Kechang reported on the negotiation process, and then the mediation methods were proposed for discussion. As a result, it was decided that 1) In principle, the purpose of canceling the layoffs has been achieved, and it should be changed to voluntary retirement. The mediation methods should be ordered to be checked by the relevant employees.</p>
<p>2) Submit to the General Assembly for record. At the beginning of this incident, the two associations suggested to the General Bureau to give it due consideration, but because the Director Huang Naishu's attitude was tough and he firmly refused to accept it, a deadlock was formed. Now, with the sincere mediation of the Ministry of Communications, the dispute can be said to have been resolved.</p>
<p>Hebei Relief Committee Begs for Relief</p>
<h3>Telegram Requesting Relief for Hundreds of Thousands of Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees received a telegram from the Hebei Relief Committee yesterday, saying that the charitable organizations are all aware that Hebei is unfortunately plagued by disasters. The war has just ended, and the floods have followed. Since July of this year, the Daqing, Tuo, Zhu, Ji, Yun, Zhang, Wei, and other rivers have successively burst their banks. All the dikes have collapsed. Anping, Raoyang, Boye, Daming, Jixian, Lixian, Di, Changcheng, and other ten counties have all become swamps. Preparations for relief are underway, but the Yellow River has burst its banks again within the Changyuan territory. The torrent is surging, and Changyuan, Dongming, and Puyang counties are all sighing. The suffering is even worse than the above-mentioned counties. According to telegrams from the counties, the water is more than ten feet deep, endangering the city walls. Villages and houses have been washed away, and people and animals have drowned. Those who are fortunate enough to survive are escaping to trees and crying for help. The situation is unbearable to see. The flood in Changyuan is particularly large and has already entered the city. The severity of the disaster is no less than the water disasters in Jianghuai last year. At present, Puyang, Yuan, and Dong counties have already distributed urgent relief in advance, but the disaster is too serious, and it is only a drop in the bucket. It is difficult to provide a complete life without continuing to raise huge sums of money. Although the disaster in Daming, Anping, and other ten counties is slightly lighter than the former three counties, the disaster area is vast and the number of disaster victims is large. They are all hungry and look forward to relief. Without planning a large amount of relief funds and distributing them separately, it is difficult to extend the remaining life. The association is responsible for relief and cannot shirk its responsibility. However, after the great disaster, the financial situation is exhausted, and the treasury is empty. It is a pity that we lack the art of turning stone into gold. We are wandering around in a panic and have no策. Moreover, during the water disasters in Jianghuai last year and the war in North China this year, the central government and various parties provided huge sums of money or provided clothing and medicine. Righteous grain and benevolent slurry have saved countless lives. The water disasters suffered by Changyuan and other counties are the same as the above-mentioned soldiers and water disasters. We earnestly request you to be mindful of the people's difficulties and give early and generous relief, so that hundreds of thousands of hungry people on the river bank can enjoy the rain and dew. May the benefits to the disaster victims be endless. The telegram is extremely urgent and awaits orders. The following is omitted.</p>
<p>Kong Xianrong Went to Hong Kong the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<h3>He Will Meet Wang Delin and Return to Defense Together</h3>
<p>General Kong Xianrong, Deputy Commander of the Jilin National Salvation Army, returned to China from Europe and settled the issue of housing for his family. General Kong has now been summoned by General Commander Wang Delin and took the Taikoo Company's Linan ship to Hong Kong from Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (25th). Mr. Liang Detang, the representative of General Wang, accompanied him. It is reported that after Generals Wang and Kong meet in Hong Kong, they will set off together and return to the defense via Europe to reorganize their troops and continue to resist Japan.</p>
<h3>Director Wu Xingya of the Social Affairs Bureau Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wu Xingya, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, went to Lushan to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After the matter was completed, he went to Wuhan and had some contacts. He has now returned to Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianguo ship and has returned to his office as usual.</p>
<h3>Counselor Yin Rugeng of the Municipal Government Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yin Rugeng, a counselor of the Municipal Government, was ordered by the Executive Yuan to be transferred to North China to assist Huang Fu and others in handling the ceasefire negotiations. Now that the war zone has been taken over successively, he returned to Shanghai from Beijing the night before to rest for a while. He will ask for leave from the government starting next week.</p>
<p>[Italian Cruiser Arrives in Shanghai&gt;</p>
<p>After the Italian Far East warship, the cruiser Caboto, was transferred back to Italy, the Italian government has now transferred the cruiser Quinto from Italy to Shanghai to replace the flagship in Asia. At 9 a.m. yesterday, it had already sailed to Shanghai and immediately entered the Huangpu River, anchoring in front of the Gonghexiang Wharf. The ship carried a team of naval soldiers, who are currently staying in Shanghai temporarily. It is said that they will travel to North China.</p>
<p>The Pudong Association Sends a Telegram Requesting Not to Add Two Yuan to the Winter Grain Tax</p>
<h3>How Can a Political System Be Credible If It Breaks Faith with the People?</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of Jiangsu Province adding two yuan to the winter grain tax, the Pudong Association held a meeting of directors and supervisors a few days ago and decided to send a telegram to the Central Government, saying that the Jiangsu Province's addition of two yuan to the winter grain tax has been repeatedly presented by local groups since the 19th year. The Ministry of Finance approved that this case would be limited to the winter grain tax in the 19th year. However, it continued to be levied in the 20th and 21st years. At the beginning of the 21st year, the association presented a telegram to the Ministry of Finance with the serial number Fu Zi 284, stating that starting from the 21st year, the order of the Executive Yuan to exempt the tax would be followed. However, the tax was still levied in December. A telegram was presented to the Ministry of Finance with the serial number Fu Zi 989, stating that the two yuan added to the winter grain tax this year was previously approved by the Executive Yuan. It seems that year after year, the government has broken faith with the people. How can such a political system be credible? Now it is heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has submitted a proposal to continue levying the tax, and the public is terrified. It is not only the association that feels this way. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt, talking about revitalization is better than reducing extra demands. The country is based on the people. Cherishing one point of the people's strength is cultivating one point of vitality. If there is a proposal to extend the tax, please do not approve it. We are extremely eager to await orders. The Pudong Association bows and begs for forgiveness.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Changes Office Hours</h3>
<p>The office hours of the Shanghai Municipal Government and its affiliated organs are changed to 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. during the summer. Now that the golden breeze is sending coolness, the office hours of the Municipal Government have been set to return to the usual hours of 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. starting from September 1st. The Municipal Government has issued a notice to all its affiliated organs to comply with it.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Engineers' Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers held a regular meeting at the Bankers' Club at No. 4 Hong Kong Road at 7 p.m. on the 21st. About 20 people attended. The meeting was chaired by Vice President Wang Shengshan. The meeting first gathered for dinner. After dinner, Dai Ji, a member of the association and a lacquer expert, gave a speech on the progress of lacquer technology in the past 25 years, such as the application of electronic methods, the use of tung oil instead of flaxseed oil, and the improvement of lacquer manufacturing machinery. The most labor-saving and time-saving lacquer manufacturing machinery can now be managed by one person, and can produce lacquer cans by mechanically feeding materials for a certain period of time, and can produce various styles. However, its most important raw material is tung oil. Countries have been using tung oil produced in China for many years, and they are now engaged in planting tung trees in their own countries and have achieved results. Although the output is not much at present, each country will be able to supply itself in the future. At this time, China must quickly prepare for it and use other methods to make oil with a lower value to replace tung oil, such as the example of using both real silk and rayon. Mr. Dai's research on manufacturing tung oil using machine oil has been successful and can be called artificial tung oil to meet future needs. The attendees discussed it, and Chairman Wang expressed his thanks and said that China's lacquer industry was originally a major industry, but since the import of foreign lacquer, many Chinese people have used foreign lacquer, so a lot of money has been leaked out every year. In recent years, Mr. Dai Ji and his colleagues have advocated the self-manufacture of foreign lacquer, and several factories have been established. After several years of competition with foreign imports, they have now regained 60% of the foreign goods sales. Such management can be said to be the right way to save the country, and I am deeply impressed. The meeting was adjourned at more than 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Shanghai University School of Commerce Continues to Run an Industrial Management Training Class</p>
<h3>Expanding the Number of Students to 100</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Union sent a letter to each factory yesterday, saying that the personnel situation has become increasingly complicated in recent years, and factories have felt more and more difficulties in management. The union, in view of this, consulted with Shanghai University last summer and jointly established an industrial management training class in the School of Commerce of the university. All students are recommended by various factories and graduate in one year. The curriculum focuses on factory management accounting and various industrial regulations. The teachers are drawn from the teachers of the School of Commerce and rotate to teach. For the past year, the results have been remarkable. All the students who have graduated from the class and returned to the factory have been recognized by the factory owners as being very satisfactory. It is planned to expand the number of students to 100 this autumn, and at the same time, the association feels that it is extremely important. "Because there will be factory inspections in both Chinese concessions in the near future," a member was immediately sent to contact your association in person with a letter, hoping that you will maintain it, so that more students can enroll this autumn to achieve greater achievements. The union's work is not beneficial to the union itself, and the benefits are still on the factory side. Please send a letter to each association's factory, explaining the union's intention to establish an industrial management training class, and please actively maintain it and persuade the factories to send members to enroll. We will be deeply grateful. A copy of the industrial management training class brief is enclosed. With the arrival of the fall, both associations feel it is extremely important. "Because there will be factory inspections in both Chinese concessions in the near future," a member was immediately sent to contact your association in person with a letter, hoping that you will maintain it, so that more students can enroll this autumn to achieve greater achievements. The union's work is not beneficial to the union itself, and the benefits are still on the factory side. Please send a letter to each association's factory, explaining the union's intention to establish an industrial management training class, and please actively maintain it and persuade the factories to send members to enroll. We will be deeply grateful. A copy of the industrial management training class brief is enclosed. The fall semester's first entrance examination will be held on July 22, and the second entrance examination will be held on September 20. If your factory is willing to recommend students and needs to read the brief, please attach two cents of postage and send it directly to the Office of the School of Commerce of Shanghai University, No. 29 Yuanmingyuan Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Meeting of the Rice Milling Industry Association</p>
<h3>Resolving on Machinist Prices</h3>
<p>The Rice Milling Industry Association held a special meeting yesterday, chaired by Zhu Zixiang. It was resolved that the machinist prices in the industry were inconsistent. It is now stipulated that starting from September 1st, the customer cargo buns transported to Shanghai will be 155 catties (including the bag) per Shanghai peck, 21 cents per Shanghai peck for rough indica rice, 23 cents for rough japonica rice, 25 cents for rough yuan rice, and 16 cents for turned rice. In addition, the factory is prone to losses if the customer cargo remittance and transport to Shanghai cannot meet the prescribed limits. It was decided that the association should notify the Nanjing Silver and Money Association and the Transportation Industry Association to follow the prices set by the conference. If the prices are exceeded, the industry will unanimously refuse to mention it. The prices set will be notified once a week, and a committee to determine the limit prices will be appointed. In addition, the association will send a letter questioning the stone powder factory's joint price increase. Since the price of rice has fallen drastically and new measuring instruments have been used, the price should be reduced and should not be increased. If the price increase cannot be canceled, the industry will not adopt it. Other cases were discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Shu Yuanhe Sues the Police Station Case</h3>
<p>The case of Shu Yuanhe, the owner of the Yiqingyong Wine Shop at No. 76 Milu Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, being beaten was investigated yesterday afternoon by Inspector Li of the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, accompanied by a forensic doctor. It was found that Shu Yuanhe, the owner of the Yiqingyong Wine Shop, was 54 years old, from Jurong, and lived upstairs at No. 76 Milu Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession. After a detailed examination by the forensic doctor, it was found that Shu Yuanhe had injuries on his chest, back, fingers, and other parts. The blood-stained clothes and pants, as well as the three photos of the wine jars and urns smashed by the police, were submitted to the case, requesting that the police officers No. 1154 and others who committed the murder be brought to justice. After Inspector Li verified Shu's injuries, he ordered him to return for medical treatment.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the 14 loads of wine detained by the Second District General Administration have been certified by the Wine Industry Association that the wine tax has been exempted from stamps since July 1st this year and is uniformly subject to the special tax on local tobacco leaves and the fixed tax on local wine. The Ministry of Finance has issued Interpretation Order No. 1223, stating that tobacco and alcohol need not be affixed with stamps anymore. Therefore, the Second District General Administration has returned all the detained wine to Yiqingyong this morning.</p>
<p>Three Major Masterpieces Sold at Half Price</p>
<h3>Masterpieces by Mr. Chu Minyi, Song Chunfang, and Zhang Henshui</h3>
<p>Chu Minyi's "Memoirs of a European Tour," Song Chunfang's "Monte Carlo," and Zhang Henshui's "Fleeting Years." The first two books are travelogues that directly describe the experiences and observations of the authors, forming their own unique styles. They are not comparable to ordinary people's works. The latter book is a novel that tells the story of a young man who is ignorant of seeking education, career, and love, and eventually cannot be recovered. The writing is tortuous and reveals the psychology of young people in general, and it is so moving that people never tire of reading it a hundred times. The handwriting of the masters is indeed extraordinary. All three books are published by the China Travel Service in this city. "Memoirs of a European Tour" is priced at $1.50, "Monte Carlo" is priced at 80 cents, and "Fleeting Years" is priced at $2.00. In order to give preferential treatment to readers, a half-price sale is being held. All those who purchase the above three books at the same time will only pay $2.15.

<h3>Rickshaw Puller Couldn't Bear the Pain and Committed Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Sun Shaoqing, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, 53 years old, lived in the Yang's rickshaw inn (commonly known as a rickshaw den) at No. 12 Saint Trinity Road, French Concession. Recently, he suffered from illness, and the treatment was ineffective. He endured a lot of pain and had a short-sighted idea. He swallowed raw opium and committed suicide the day before yesterday. When the poison took effect, the innkeeper, Yang, realized that he had suffered from heatstroke. After inquiring, he learned that he had committed suicide by poisoning because of his illness. He was rushed to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. He died at 6:50 a.m. yesterday. The hospital notified the French Police Station, and the police sent a detective to take the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary for an autopsy. In the morning, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, Chen Beisan, arrived at the mortuary and confirmed that the deceased had committed suicide by poisoning before his death. Because the body belonged to a poor man who could not afford a coffin, the court approved the body to be buried by Tongren Fuyuan Hall on his behalf.</p>
<p>A Truck Crushed a 71-Year-Old Man</p>
<h3>Liu Huai-shu Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Liu Huai-shu, an elderly Jiangbei vegetable vendor residing in a thatched cottage on Bailinan Road in West Shanghai, aged 71, was selling vegetables in front of the Minsheng Factory in Zhoujiaqiao market at approximately 6:10 am yesterday when a cargo truck with license number 3702, traveling slowly from west to east, approached. As the old man attempted to move out of the way, the Minsheng Factory released its workers, causing a surge that knocked him to the ground. The truck's rear wheel ran over his head, instantly shattering his skull, splattering his brain matter, and causing his immediate death. The scene was gruesome and unbearable to witness. A police officer on duty arrived and detained the driver, Zhang Ziyun, along with the truck in the Sixth District. The officer then instructed the local bailiff to report the incident to the District Court Prosecutor for inspection. The bailiff ordered the deceased's son, Mingzi, to prepare for the encoffining and burial. After an interrogation by District Officer Jiang, the driver was sent to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Autopsy of Bullet Proves Huang Yonghua Was Killed by Communists</h3>
<p>Bullet identical to the one used in the assassination of Ma Shaowu</p>
<p>The bandits planned meticulously in advance and had been scouting for days</p>
<p>| Huang Yongquan, Huang's attendant, also died of severe injuries last night |</p>
<p>Huang Yonghua, Director of the Special Affairs Section of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Inspection Department, was shot and assassinated by two thugs near the elevator on the fifth floor of the New Shanghai Hotel on Nanjing Road in the Public Concession at approximately 11 p.m. the night before. Huang was hit by two bullets and died on the spot. Huang's attendant, Huang Yongquan, was also seriously injured. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. After the incident, the Lao Zha Police Station immediately transported Huang's body to the forensic examination center on Ferren Road to await autopsy. They also urgently notified Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau by telephone, who promptly dispatched Detective Captain Lu Ying and all detectives to investigate. At the same time, detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station thoroughly examined the bullet casings, and the results indicated that they were the same as the bullets used in the recent assassination of former Inspectorate Special Affairs Director Ma Shaowu, proving a complete connection to the Ma case.</p>
<p>(Corpse Examination) Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei, dispatched by the First Special District Court, arrived at the forensic examination center to inspect the body. In the opening statement, the Western police chief explained the investigation process, stating that three bullets and four bullet casings were found at the scene of the incident. Public Security Bureau Inspector Wang Wenjun added that the deceased's family members were all in their hometown, so Director Wen sent him to claim the body on their behalf. Prosecutor Guo, after hearing the testimony, ruled that the deceased Huang Yonghua had died from gunshot wounds to the abdomen. The three bullets and four bullet casings were temporarily handed over to the police station's firearms department for examination. The escaped murderers were to be strictly apprehended by the police for investigation and prosecution. The body was handed over to Wang Wenjun, the representative of the Public Security Bureau, who signed for it and took it away for encoffining and burial.</p>
<p>(Successive Important Positions) Yesterday, this reporter spoke with a close friend of Huang, a current Public Security Bureau official. According to him, Huang's true hometown was Rugao, Jiangbei, but he falsely claimed to be from Shaoxing due to special foreign connections. It was also said that Huang Yonghua was not his real name. He had indeed joined the Communist Party at one time and held a special position within the party. When he was in his hometown, he had several disputes with the Rugao County Party Committee. At that time, Huang resolutely changed course and surrendered to the Central Government, becoming a loyal comrade of the Chinese Nationalist Party. Subsequently, he successively held important positions such as Director of the Political Training Department of the 28th Division of the 31st Army of the National Revolutionary Army, Staff Member of the Training Department of the Central Party Headquarters, Judge of the Military Law Department of the Wuhan Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, Special Commissioner of Party Affairs of the 12th Division of the Army, and Staff Member of the Organization of the Central Party Headquarters. On September 26 of last year, he was appointed by the Central Government as a preparatory committee member of the Seamen's Special Party Department. On November 9 of last year, he was appointed Director of the Special Affairs Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The previously assassinated Ma Shaowu was Huang's assistant.</p>
<p>(Usual Precautions) In recent years, most of the reactionary organizations uncovered in Shanghai were handled by Huang. Therefore, the Communist Party held a grudge against him, and Huang was well aware of his dangerous situation. Although Huang's residence was in the Chinese area, only one or two direct superiors and perhaps his closest friends and relatives knew of its location. Even when important matters occurred, he only communicated by telephone, which shows a glimpse of his daily precautions. Huang went to Beijing on the 20th of this month for important late-night matters and arrived in Shanghai on the early morning express train at 7:30 a.m. the day before yesterday. He immediately took his own car, number 8085 (Chinese area number 2289), directly to his residence. Because Huang's wife, Zhou Lanzhen, had gone to a retreat in Hangzhou's West Lake to recuperate, he left after a short stay.</p>
<p>(Bandits' Plans) It was not until around 10 p.m. that he went to Room 618 on the fifth floor of the New Shanghai Hotel to meet a friend, unaware that the bandits had been lying in wait. According to a tea server at the New Shanghai Hotel, around 2 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 22nd), a male guest speaking with an Anhui accent, wearing a dark blue silk shirt, and about 30 years old, came to the hotel and booked Room 519 on the fifth floor under the surname Gao. Soon after, two men in short blue outfits arrived and talked behind closed doors for a long time, acting very suspiciously. They never called a tea server into the room. The next day, they changed to Room 638 on the south side of the fifth floor, and three more men, one in a gray long gown and two in white silk long gowns, came to visit and talked for a long time before leaving. After Huang's tragic incident, these unwelcome guests left and never returned.</p>
<p>(Central Government's Condolences) The assassins' procedures were very thorough. Since Ma Shaowu's death, Huang had been constantly on edge, taking precautions everywhere. Whenever Huang went to a place, he would first hold his self-defense pistol in his hand and inspect the surroundings before getting in or out of a car. Unexpectedly, the bandits had thoroughly scouted his movements and assassinated him by shooting near the elevator on the fifth floor, a place no one would have expected. This shows that they had a detailed plan in advance. The Central Government was extremely saddened by Huang's tragic death. His body has been encoffined at the China Funeral Home. The funeral expenses, which will cost over 1,000 yuan, will be advanced by Director Wen.</p>
<p>(Attendant's Death) In addition to his wife, Zhou, Huang also had an elderly mother in her seventies and a five-year-old daughter. His family situation is very desolate. Huang's attendant, Huang Yongquan, after being sent to Renji Hospital, died at 9 p.m. last night because the bullet had pierced a vital part of his chest. Although the doctors tried their best to save him, he died due to excessive bleeding from the lung injury. The hospital notified the police station, who transported the body to the forensic examination center on Ferren Road to await autopsy.</p>
<h3>Box Corpse Case: Suspect Admits to Murder During Preliminary Hearing</h3>
<p>Appears calm and shows no fear</p>
<p>Elder brother is terrified and denies everything</p>
<p>| Suspect to be handed over to Macao after another round of witness questioning |</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Portuguese Consulate held its fourth hearing on the box corpse case. The suspect, Ba Delie, was subjected to three preliminary hearings, and all the witnesses appeared in court, proving his criminal behavior. The Portuguese suspect, realizing that he could not deny the charges, confessed in court to killing the Cantonese woman Zhang Cailian. At this point, the truth of the case was revealed. The Portuguese Consulate's investigation of this case lasted fifteen days and included four preliminary hearings, and it can now be considered complete. The details of yesterday's hearing and the suspect's confession are recorded below.</p>
<p>(All Witnesses Gathered) The Portuguese Consulate's interrogation in the box corpse case was entirely dependent on the witnesses appearing in court to testify, making it impossible for the suspect to deny the charges. At 10:30 a.m. yesterday, Portuguese Consul-General Dr. Xue Erfo brought the defendants Ba Delie Leimidao and Qiu Shifu Leimidao.</p>
<p>All the witnesses in the case were present, including the landlord of No. 15 Jiaxing Road, Chen Chunyuan from the Zongpeng store on Jiaxing Road who sold the iron bed, his partner Ma Xiaowei, the Japanese neighbor Da Cang from No. 14 Youyifangli, and the Portuguese, etc. Linghua Photo Studio, which took Zhang Cailian's photo, also sent Zhao Bingkun to court. With all the witnesses gathered, the Portuguese Consul began the interrogation.</p>
<p>(Municipal Government Sends Observer) The Shanghai Municipal Government sent Counselor Luo Panhui to court to observe during the first interrogation by the Portuguese Consulate. Yesterday's fourth preliminary hearing marked the end of the interrogations in Shanghai, so Counselor Luo came to the Portuguese Consulate with a letter to observe before the court session began and remained until the interrogation was completed. The lawyer hired by the defendant, Lei Gelun, also appeared in court to defend Ba Delie and Qiu Shifu. Therefore, yesterday's interrogation had more witnesses than the previous three hearings.</p>
<p>(Suspect Confesses to Brutal Murder) The suspects Ba Delie and Qiu Shifu were escorted to court by Western Detective Williams from the police station at 10:40 a.m. and remained seated in the defendant's dock. The Portuguese Consul Xue Erfo first interrogated Ba Delie, questioning whether he had killed the Chinese woman and stating that the evidence was conclusive and that he should confess the truth. Ba Delie, knowing that he could not deny the charges, spoke frankly and appeared calm and not afraid. Ba Delie confessed that he had indeed killed the Chinese woman Zhang Cailian. The murder occurred around midnight on August 4, approximately 12:00 a.m. The location of the murder was upstairs in the house at No. 15 Jiaxing Road. Zhang Cailian was killed by being struck in the head with an ice-breaking tool. When Zhang Cailian cried for help, he used a pillow from the bed to cover her mouth, preventing her from making any sound. As a result, the woman died within a few minutes.</p>
<p>(Moving the Body and Packing It into a Box) Ba Delie also confessed that after killing Zhang on the night of the 4th, he did not sleep that night and stayed in the same room with the female corpse. At dawn, he went out and bought a suitcase from Sandefang, which he carried back to pack the body. At that time, he was in a state of mental confusion and didn't know what to do. After bringing the suitcase to No. 15 Jiaxing Road and carrying it upstairs, he carried the female corpse into the box. He did this all by himself, without any help from others. After packing the corpse into the box, he hired a rickshaw on the street and ordered the driver to transport it to the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu. The box was carried out of the house at 12:00 a.m. on August 5 and arrived at the wharf at 1:30 a.m., where it was handed over to a coolie to be sent onto the Shanghai Maru ship.</p>
<p>(Trying to Exonerate His Brother) Ba Delie spoke clearly during his confession, but he was sweating profusely and often wiped his forehead with a towel. Ba Delie said that killing Zhang Cailian was a moment of anger and not premeditated. He also claimed that he bought the suitcase and transported the body all by himself, trying to exonerate his brother Qiu Shifu, saying that his brother did not know about the murder of Zhang. He only met his brother on the road after buying the suitcase on the 5th, and even then, his brother did not know that he was buying the suitcase to transport Zhang's body. The court clerk recorded Ba Delie's confession in detail and read it back to him.</p>
<p>(Interrogation of the Accomplice) After Ba Delie confessed to killing Zhang, the Portuguese Consul showed him a photo of Zhang Cailian (taken by Linghua) and asked him if it was her. Ba Delie replied that it was. He was also asked if he wrote the words on the box, and he replied that he did. Then Ba was taken aside, and his brother, the accomplice Qiu Shifu, was interrogated. Qiu Shifu appeared fearful and terrified during his confession, but he firmly denied any involvement in the case. He said that he only met his younger brother on the afternoon of August 5 and knew nothing about the murder or the transportation of the body. He only knew that his younger brother was moving and helped him carry things. He claimed that he did not go upstairs. He only heard his brother mention the murder of Zhang Cailian after the fact. After he found out, he didn't know what to do and kept it to himself. He absolutely did not participate. At this point, the Portuguese Consul showed him the photo of Zhang Cailian and asked if it was her, and he replied that it was.</p>
<p>(To Be Sent to Macao Soon) Yesterday's interrogation lasted a very long time. When Ba Delie left the Xiamen Road West Prison, his lawyer, Lei Gelun, talked to the two defendants for a long time. At the beginning of the hearing, before Ba Delie had made a confession, the defendant's lawyer stated to the court that the defendant had something to say, and then he gradually confessed to the murder. Now that the case has been investigated, the two defendants are still being held in the West Prison. In the next few days, the Consulate will need to question the witnesses once again before handing the suspect Ba Delie over to Macao for a formal trial by the court.</p>
<h3>How Did the Old Beggar Die?</h3>
<p>Must await forensic examination to clarify</p>
<p>Beggar's brother claims the Yongtaixiang shop owner beat him to death</p>
<p>Gu Kou (aka White-Eyed Er'er) from Tongzhou, aged 60, made a living by begging. On the 21st of this month at approximately 11:00 a.m., Gu and another beggar named Ying Zhengming were begging for food along Grant Road. Ying was walking in front, and Gu was behind. When they reached the entrance of the Yongtaixiang Paper Shop at No. 142 Grant Road, Gu intended to beg from the shop, but unexpectedly collapsed to the ground and lost consciousness. A Chinese constable from Station No. 6 noticed this and immediately sent him to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died. The Yangshupu Police Station was informed and instructed Detective Ji Xiucheng to investigate. They learned that Gu had died of illness and reported back to the police chief, who instructed the Pushan Villa to bury the body. However, at approximately 8:00 p.m. that evening, the deceased's cousin, Gu Xiaomei, and Ying Zhengming went to the police station and claimed that Gu had been beaten to death by the shop owner and requested an investigation. After a thorough investigation by the police chief, it was determined that there was no evidence to support the claim, and they were dismissed. Gu Xiaomei was still dissatisfied and filed a petition with the First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office on the 24th, requesting a thorough investigation. Chief Prosecutor Wang approved the disinterment for a second autopsy because the case involved a human life. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with Secretary Wang Zuyi, forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan, drove to the forensic examination center on Ferren Road. The Chinese and Western detectives handling the case had already hoisted the coffin containing the body and summoned all the witnesses. Prosecutor Guo first interrogated Gu Xiaomei, who testified, "I did not witness my brother fall. Afterwards, Ying Zhengming informed me that he had been beaten to death by the Yongtaixiang shop owner." Then, Ying Zhengming testified, "Although I was begging in the same place as the deceased, I am blind. After Gu the beggar died, I heard people say that he had been beaten by the shop owner, so I reported it to Gu Xiaomei." Finally, Chinese Constable No. 6 and Western Detective No. 10 arrived to report that they had witnessed the beggar suddenly collapse to the ground and lose consciousness. According to a hawker surnamed Yan, the beggar had fallen on his own and had not been beaten. Prosecutor Guo, after reviewing the testimony, stated that in order to confirm the cause of the beggar's death, it was necessary to reopen the coffin and conduct another autopsy. He asked Gu Xiaomei if he agreed to the re-examination, and Gu expressed extreme approval and personally lifted the coffin lid. Forensic doctors Wei and Zhang immediately began the autopsy, but it could not be completed in a short time. Prosecutor Guo then adjourned the hearing to next Monday, after which he would review the forensic report.</p>
<h3>New Developments in the 129,000 Yuan Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Stolen money found under the stairs in Zhou Xuechun's house</p>
<p>Li Along's brother, sister-in-law, and others also arrested</p>
<p>In the case of the 129,800 yuan robbery that occurred on Xin Yong'an Street in the French Concession, the master thief Li Along, also known as Scarface Along, initially took out 5,000 yuan of the stolen money and gave it to his wife, Li Jinxiang, for safekeeping. Li then rented a house at No. 337 An'najin Road for his mistress, Zhou Xuechun, to live with him. Zhou secretly stole 4,000 yuan of the remaining stolen money and fled. When Li discovered this, he grabbed Zhou's sister, Zhou Aibao, and forced her to hand over Xuechun, which led to a quarrel. The police discovered this and detained Li Jinxiang for interrogation at the Public Security Bureau. The French police learned of this and sent Detective Qin Youyu to bring Li Jinxiang back to the police station. When she was sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation the day before yesterday, Zhou Xuechun suddenly surrendered with her lawyer, Ye Fikang, and denied stealing the stolen money, hoping to evade responsibility. It was ordered that Zhou be detained and handed over to the police for investigation, and Li was remanded in custody. The hearing was adjourned to the 29th. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after Zhou was brought back to the police station for investigation by Detective Qin Youyu, she admitted that she had stolen Li's stolen money for distribution after being instigated by others. She had 975 yuan in banknotes remaining, which she had hidden in the Zhou Yuanchang redwood shop opened by her father, Zhou Yupei, at No. 48 Fumin Street inside the New North Gate. Detective Qin then took Zhou Xuechun to the Zhou Yuanchang redwood shop with the police from the Public Security Bureau and recovered a package of stolen banknotes totaling 975 yuan from under the third step of the stairs. She was immediately brought back to the police station. Yesterday, Zhou was transferred to the Eighth Court of the Second Special Court, where she was interrogated by Judge Wu Fanglian. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated, "In this case, we request an adjournment to arrest the accomplices and merge it into the Li Jinxiang case." The judge questioned Zhou and rejected the request of Zhou's defense lawyer, Ye Fikang, to allow the defendant to be released on bail. He then ordered that the defendant remain in custody and adjourned the hearing to the 29th.</p>
<p>It is also reported that since the major robbery case occurred, Inspector Jin Jiulin and Detective Zhang Ziying of the French police's special unit have been making every effort to investigate and arrest the gang, as several members of the Da Luosong gang are still at large and the stolen money has not been recovered. They received a tip that the master thief Li Along had stored a portion of the stolen money with his accomplice Zhang Weicai, which had already been investigated. He had also used 10,000 yuan, giving 5,000 yuan to his wife, Li Jinxiang, for safekeeping, and Zhou Xuechun had stolen 4,000 yuan of that amount, which had already been seized. He had also given 4,000 yuan to his elder brother, Li Longsheng, for safekeeping and taken 1,000 yuan with Zhang Weicai to Jiashan for spending. It was learned that Li's brother lived at No. 12 Chaomibang in Zhabei. At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, he, along with Deputy Detective Zhou Bingcheng, Jiang Changwen, Detective Qin Youyu, Cai Jinzhang, and Ma Yizhi, went to the address with the police from the Public Security Bureau and arrested Li Longsheng (44 years old, from Suzhou) and his wife, Li Wang (34 years old, from Ningbo). They confessed that they had received 4,000 yuan from his younger brother Along. 2,000 yuan were deposited with his elder sister, Zhu Li, at No. 278 Min'anfang on Fuxu Road, and 1,800 yuan was used to hire lawyers Ma Shouhua and Wu Zhengzheng to handle Along's appeal. 200 yuan had been used. The detectives then took Li Longsheng and his wife to Zhu Li's house in Min'anfang on Fuxu Road and recovered a package of original stolen banknotes totaling 2,000 yuan and a receipt for 1,800 yuan for lawyers Ma and Wu. Zhu Li, along with the stolen banknotes and receipt, were taken to the police station to await interrogation by the court tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Japanese Home Searched, Drug Ring Leader Nagasawa Handed Over to Japanese Consulate</h3>
<p>Burned Associate is Cantonese Leung Dai</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Drugs Photographed and Sent to Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>At 11:15 p.m. on the 24th of this month, a heroin manufacturing plant inside the residence of a Japanese man named Nagasawa (aka Nagasawa) at No. 1 Huanglu Road at the end of North Sichuan Road suddenly caught fire, destroying the entire house and burning one person to death and injuring another. The Disraeli Road Police Station sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the forensic examination center for identification. The injured person was sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment. The Japanese Nagasawa, who had fled to the home of his friend Jian Zhujing at No. 311 Dongxingli, Wusong Road, was also arrested by the police and handed over to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. Detectives thoroughly investigated the fire scene and recovered seven large boxes of heroin, as well as motors, alcohol, anesthetics, kerosene, and other materials used to manufacture drugs, which were all taken back to the police station for safekeeping. This has already been reported in detail. It has now been found that the person being treated for burns at Fumin Hospital is a Cantonese man named Liang Di, who had been an assistant in the Japanese man's drug manufacturing operation. However, his injuries are quite severe, so he has been transferred to the Ward Road Police Hospital for treatment. Detectives interrogated Liang, but he could not speak, so the cause of the fire is still unclear. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin submitted the case file to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court and explained the investigation to Judge Xiao. He stated that the person burned at the scene was initially mistaken for a Japanese national because he was nearly dead. He was sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment. Later, the fire chief, Japanese Nagasawa, was arrested and taken to the hospital for identification, where it was said that he had hired a Cantonese associate. Therefore, he was transferred to the Ward Road Police Hospital. However, Liang Di has been in the hospital for several days and still cannot speak. It is necessary to wait until his injuries have healed slightly to clarify whether Liang Di's name is accurate. However, the police seized as many as seven boxes of heroin, as well as machinery, chemicals, etc. May we ask the court to conduct an on-site inspection? Because the items will soon be sent to the Japanese Consulate for review. Judge Xiao Xiefen decided that the seized exhibits could be photographed for the record and ordered that Liang Di be treated and released for interrogation after he had recovered slightly.</p>

<h3>Three Apprentices from Hengfengxin Cotton Cloth Store Commit Suicide Together</h3>
<p>All sacrifice themselves due to lack of freedom in marriage</p>
<p>Suicide note says they are determined to commit suicide and should not be searched for</p>
<p>The three have been missing for two days with no news</p>
<p>| Alas, three water ghosts; still people in spring boudoir dreams |</p>
<p>Three apprentices from the Hengfengxin Cotton Cloth Store at No. 109 Wufuli, Tianjin Road, in the Public Concession, usually worked diligently in the store and had no faults. Unexpectedly, on the 25th of this month, they agreed to leave the store without saying goodbye and committed suicide together. Their suicide note said, "We have made up our minds to commit suicide. Please don't look for us, just wait to collect the corpses." The store found the suicide note and reported it to the police station, Public Security Bureau, and Rescue Bureau in the past two days, asking them to be on the lookout. The reasons for the suicide are recorded below. Hengfengxin Cotton Cloth Store is a century-old store. The partners in the store are all old, and there are several apprentices. The three who agreed to commit suicide this time were Pan Songbai, from She County, 21 years old, nearsighted, and always wears glasses, is an only son; Pan Zhanpeng, from She County, 19 years old, with many freckles on his face. The reason for the suicide of these two was that the store checked their family correspondence and found that both were due to lack of freedom in marriage and families that were too old-fashioned, leading to the determination to commit suicide. Another apprentice named Shi Bingnan, also known as Sannan, from Dongting East Mountain, 19 years old, of medium height, speaks Shanghainese, also had the intention of committing suicide due to economic and marital problems. In early July, he took a photo and wrote on the back of the photo, "Alas, three water ghosts; still people in spring boudoir dreams." He also wrote to his mother, saying that men and women are the same and asking her to cultivate his sister to study. What is strange is that the three apprentices left without taking a penny. It has been two days since they left, and there is no news. The store has telegraphed their families to come to Shanghai to search for them.</p>
<h3>New Method Laundering Industry Resolves Violation of Industry Rules</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng Society says that the Shanghai New Method Laundering Industry Association, due to illegal price cuts by the Choakesheng Laundry on Haig Road, has caused opposition from the industry as a whole and almost led to a citywide shutdown. The Bureau of Social Affairs has now convened a mediation and fined the store ten yuan for such actions. Yonghua Hong Kong Company and others were also fined five yuan and two yuan. On the one hand, the Choakesheng store also believes that the use of such means to engage in business competition damages the feelings of the industry. It has written to the association voluntarily withdrawing the advertisement, restoring the original price, requesting to join the association to abide by industry rules, and publishing an apology in the newspaper. The storm has subsided.</p>

<p>Morphine Hidden in Soap</p>
<h3>A Woman on a Tram Exposed Her Deceitful Actions; Many Involved Persons Were Subsequently Arrested</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Inspection Team conducted a search on the No. 14 trolleybus at the intersection of Fujian Road and Guangdong Road at 2:50 PM the day before yesterday. Female inspector Cao Zhang found 11 liang of morphine on a Ningbo woman, Xu Liu, and took her to the Xinzha Police Station. After investigation by Chinese detective Zhang Yuanqing and plainclothes detective Cao Qishan, Xu Liu confessed that a certain Li gave her five yuan to carry the drugs. The detectives then, together with French Concession detectives, searched Li's residence at No. 3 Qingyu Lane, Ximen Road, in the French Concession. Initially, nothing was found. However, upon further searching, the police became suspicious of the numerous bars of soap in the house. They cut open the soap bars and discovered that they had been hollowed out and filled with morphine. A large amount of money obtained from selling morphine was also confiscated. Six people living in the house were arrested and taken to the French Concession Police Station. Soon after, another person arrived to purchase morphine and was also arrested by the officers guarding the premises and taken to the French Concession Police Station. Yesterday morning, the Old Zha Police Station sent Xu Liu to the First Special Court's Criminal Division for questioning. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case, requesting punishment according to Article 1 of the revised regulations for the suppression of morphine. The French Concession Police sent French detective Li Dishi to court, requesting custody of Xu Liu, stating that due to time constraints, the Second Court's official documents were not yet ready but would be submitted later. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, briefly questioned Xu Liu and ordered her to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<p>A Wall Collapses in Baoting Lane, Lujiabang, Injuring Many</p>
<h3>Yang Cao Suffered the Most Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>Baoting Lane in Lujiabang, outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi, consists of one or two alleyways. Apart from the twenty-odd storefronts along the street, the rest are single or double-story shikumen buildings, totaling dozens of structures. Due to years of neglect, they have become dilapidated. The owner of the lane, Taichang Real Estate Company, originally intended to rebuild new houses, but due to financial constraints, they hired a construction company to repair the buildings to prevent danger. All residents and shopkeepers in the lane were notified and had moved elsewhere. The construction company hired by Taichang Real Estate surrounded the area with bamboo fences and sent a large number of workers to begin repairs. They noticed that a short wall at the No. 57 gate on the south side of the lane needed to be rebuilt because there was a well behind the wall, and water had been seeping into the foundation of the wall for years, causing it to weaken. Yesterday, two bricklayers were assigned to demolish the old wall in order to build a new one. Yang Erfang, a local resident, 61 years old, and his wife, Cao, 54 years old, had only one daughter, Mingzhu, 26 years old, who had been married to Le Genfa from Ningbo through a matchmaker. Because Yang Erfang was old and unable to work, he was supported by his son-in-law and lived with him at No. 2, Lane 60, Yutang Lane. The back building of the house was rented to Yang Yuchun, a Shandong man who ran a sesame cake shop. Yang was 38 years old, his wife, Wang, was 28 years old, and they had two sons, Lianyou, 6 years old, and Liancheng, 2 years old. The back door of their house faced the front door of No. 57 in Baoting Lane. Yesterday morning, Yang Erfang and Yang Yuchun's families were washing clothes or chatting idly at the back door. Two bricklayers were sitting on top of the wall at the No. 57 gate in Baoting Lane, demolishing it. At about 8 o'clock, the short wall, which was about ten feet long, suddenly collapsed. The two bricklayers working on the wall also fell. With a crash, Yang Erfang and others were unable to avoid it and were buried under the wall. The local police station of the First District was notified, and station chief Yi Zuanren arrived at the scene with patrol officers. They quickly rescued the injured men and women from the rubble and transported them to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The foreman, Zheng Afu, was taken back to the police station for questioning and reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation. Among those injured, Yang Cao suffered the most serious injuries and was hospitalized. Yang Erfang suffered a minor leg injury, and Yang Wang and Yang Lianyou suffered minor head injuries. Song Zhang, a woman from Hebei living at No. 1, Lane 60, was also washing clothes there and suffered a minor leg injury. A child, Zhang Dazhai, from No. 57 Wangmiao Street, who was playing there, also suffered a minor head injury. All of them were treated at the hospital and then returned home. The two bricklayers who fell from the wall, Pan Tongsheng and Liu Yusheng, suffered only minor injuries and were discharged from the hospital after treatment and medication.</p>
<p>The Case of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory Being Sued for Medicinal Narcotics</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council's Misunderstanding; The Chamber of Commerce and Others Have Intervened on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory has been established for many years and has been registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and obtained a license from the Bureau of Health. It has a number of doctors and pharmacists in charge of manufacturing and is a well-known manufacturer of national products. However, at 11:00 AM on the 16th of this month, the Anti-Narcotics Department of the Central Police Station suddenly sent a French detective and a large number of detectives to search the New Asia factory. The factory sent staff to lead them to all parts of the factory, including the narcotics storage room upstairs. There were more than 200 liang of medicinal morphine in the cabinet. The French detective considered it contraband and sent detectives to guard the room. The factory informed them that the stored morphine was used exclusively for making injections and that it was handled in accordance with the regulations of the Bureau of Health for the management of pharmaceutical merchants, and showed the license issued by the Bureau of Health. The French detective then telegraphed a Western chemist from the Municipal Council to come to the factory. The factory's pharmacist explained in detail the various machines and medicines, as well as the purpose and source of the stored medicinal morphine. At 2:00 PM, the French detective took the license, books, invoices, and two liang of morphine to the lawyer, Bo Liang, for consultation, and eventually filed a public prosecution in the Special Court. The factory then entrusted lawyers Jiang Yiping, Zhang Ding, and Tu Zhenhu to defend them. During the court hearing on the 17th, the factory manager strongly argued the following four points: 1. The factory is a legitimate pharmaceutical merchant registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and has a pharmaceutical merchant license from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health. The factory handles narcotics in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Health for the management of pharmaceutical merchants, and their use is exclusively for medical purposes. 2. The factory's narcotics are purchased from French merchants, Baibu Foreign Firm, and other pharmacies. The Customs allows import, and there are books and records to prove it. 3. When the factory sells narcotics, it complies with the regulations of the Customs No. 1300, requiring signatures and seals of formal physicians, pharmacists, and hospitals as proof. 4. Narcotics have great efficacy in medicine, and all modern doctors use them. Before China had its own products, all were supplied by foreign goods. The factory, seeing the importance of this and the purpose of promoting national products, followed legal procedures and the regulations of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia to prepare medicinal narcotic injection solutions in the hope of recovering rights. Now, unfortunately, it has been subject to illegal interference. How painful! If the judge considers the factory's preparation of medicinal narcotic injection solutions to be a crime, then doctors and pharmacists who use narcotics for medical treatment will also be considered illegal, and the cause of new medicine in China will not need to be promoted. It is learned that the Shanghai Medical Association, the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have submitted petitions to the court, arguing reasonably. Attached is the following:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Association submits a document stating that the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory is operating in accordance with the law and was mistakenly searched by detectives from the police station. The document declares the facts and requests legal release to protect pharmaceutical merchants and promote the industry. Western medicine used to be dependent on foreign countries, with annual imports reaching more than 30 million, a huge loss. Recently, doctors and pharmacists who have studied in various countries have emerged, advocating the self-manufacturing of Western medicines and morphine, and other injection solutions and needle medicines, to meet the needs of treatment and anesthesia for surgery, hoping to recover rights and working hard. It is found that Zhao Rutiao, the chief pharmacist of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory at No. 1095 Xinzha Road in the city, graduated from the Faculty of Pharmacy of Chiba Medical University in Japan and has specialized knowledge and enthusiasm for manufacturing. Xu Guanqun, the manager of the factory, is strict in management and complies with published regulations. At the beginning of the business, he registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and obtained a pharmaceutical merchant license from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health. The Western medicines produced in large quantities are of many kinds and are manufactured according to new scientific methods. Morphine injection liquid is necessary for medical use. The factory handles it in accordance with Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health's regulations for the management of pharmaceutical merchants. All products have been approved by the medical community, and sales in the market are increasing. However, at 11:00 AM on the 16th of this month, (omitted) During the hearing in the Eighth Court, Xu Guanqun stated that he was a legitimate pharmaceutical merchant, that the source of morphine was all purchased from Baibu Foreign Firm, etc., and that it was not sold without the signature of a doctor or formal institution. The French detective present also stated that the statement was true. Judge Liu was understanding and ordered the police station to investigate further and allowed Xu Guanqun to be released on bail pending trial. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory manufactures Western medicines made by Chinese, and holds a license. The morphine imported is used exclusively for the manufacture of injection solutions and needle medicines and is not used for other purposes or sold separately. It is handled in accordance with the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health for the management of pharmaceutical merchants. Western medicine is now popular, and morphine injection solutions and needle medicines are commonly used for the treatment of diseases. The factory's products are used not only by the new medical community in the country but also by the central military medical teams. Therefore, there is no excessive storage of manufacturing raw materials. Although the police station's investigation was the exercise of legitimate authority, this Association believes that the morphine stored by the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory has an official license and is for legitimate pharmaceutical use. I dare to contribute what I know and submit a public document as proof. I hope that the court will review it and make a judgment as soon as possible, recognizing that the factory's behavior is innocent, so that the truth will be revealed and national Western medicine will be protected. I am grateful and respectfully submit it to Guo of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court.</p>
<p>The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association submits a document stating that the pharmaceutical factory is manufacturing in accordance with regulations and was mistakenly searched. The document requests a fair judgment to maintain business operations. The New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, a member of the Association, has been registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and holds a pharmaceutical merchant license from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health. The new medicines produced are of many kinds and are manufactured according to the ingredients specified in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Morphine injection liquid is required for medical use and used to be imported from abroad. Recently, it has also been imitated in order to recover rights. However, at 11:00 AM on the 16th of this month, (omitted) They were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court. The manager explained that the morphine was purchased from French merchants, Baibu Foreign Firm, etc., and that the Customs allowed it to enter the country and there are books and records to prove it. When the manufactured narcotics are sold, they must be certified with a signature and seal by a formal physician, pharmacist, and hospital. Judge Liu was understanding and ordered the police station to investigate further and allowed Xu Guanqun to be released on bail pending trial. The morphine injection needle produced by New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory has remarkable efficacy. Members of the Association purchased it from the factory and resold it to doctors, hospitals, and colleagues in other places. The stored morphine is indeed used for the manufacture of injection solutions and needle medicines. There is no other use, and it is not sold separately. It is handled in accordance with the regulations for the management of pharmaceutical merchants issued by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health. These morphine injection needle medicines are essential for pain relief after external surgery and bullet wounds. Therefore, the military hospitals under the central government also often purchase them from the factory. Although the police station's investigation was the exercise of legitimate authority, it was filed due to a misunderstanding that it had other functions. The Association clearly understands the history of the factory and dares to guarantee that the stored morphine is entirely for legitimate pharmaceutical use. I hereby respectfully present the facts and request that the court review them and issue a fair reply as soon as possible to maintain business operations for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce writes: On the 23rd of this month, a letter was received from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association stating that a letter had been received from the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, a member of the Association (omitted). The New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory manufactures injection solutions for the purpose of promoting the independence and self-sufficiency of new medicines. The morphine used for all injection solutions is purchased from French merchants, Baibu Foreign Firm, and various pharmacies. The Customs allows it to enter the country and there are proof. Its sale is also handled in accordance with Article 7 of the regulations for the management of pharmaceutical merchants issued by the department. The only question at present is the third item of Article 3 of the Regulations on the Management of Narcotics. However, the morphine mentioned above is not self-made. The pharmaceutical factory only prepares it according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. It does not seem to involve the regulatory norms of the special manufacturing law. I hereby prepare a letter of proof and respectfully request that the court uphold justice in order to maintain the foundation of independent Western medicine for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court.</p>

Although the weather was not good that night and there was a sudden thunderstorm, the number of tourists did not decrease slightly. They came in droves and were very enthusiastic. The lanterns in the park were shining brightly and dazzling. Yesterday (26th) happened to be Saturday, and there were even more guests, both men and women, who were crowded. It is expected that today is a birthday and also the good time for the Double Star to cross the river, and there will be more tourists than the previous two days.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Respectfully, upon reading today's news in your esteemed newspaper regarding the cracking down on a large-scale flower gambling den, Three Branches Company, located at house numbers 365 to 367 on Sanma Road's Taiping Fang, I was greatly surprised. However, house numbers 365 to 366 belong to the Fuhe official business, and are unrelated to the matter at house number 367. Therefore, I am writing to request that the editor of your esteemed newspaper make a correction to avoid any misunderstanding. Respectfully addressed to the chief editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper, Fuhe Company, August 26th.</p>
<p>Respectfully, upon reading your newspaper's 22nd edition, which carried a news item stating that Yuan Lianghua had returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, the final section mentioned the "cancellation of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department." This statement is factually incorrect and should be corrected as follows: The Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Hua Hengji, resigned. To save expenses, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will not appoint a replacement and will instead have the Director of the Agriculture Department concurrently hold the position. The name of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department has not been cancelled, nor has the Agriculture Department taken over its responsibilities, nor has the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department been changed to a Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Section. It would be appreciated if you could correct the report accordingly. Respectfully addressed to the editor-in-chief of the Shen Bao Newspaper, August 26th.</p>

<h3>The Symbol of Fighting</h3>
<p>— Si Su</p>
<p>I remember seeing a very common fight when I was little. A small street vendor selling fruit was trying to sell his goods when a burly man with a menacing face came and wanted to buy fruit from him. After the vendor named a price, the man only offered half. The vendor refused to sell, but the man insisted. After a few words, the man suddenly became furious and threw the selected fruit onto the street. The vendor did not get angry, but only asked for money. The man's face turned even redder, and he kicked over the fruit basket, causing the fruit inside to roll out. The vendor then grabbed the man and started arguing loudly, and soon a crowd gathered to watch the commotion. However, the man was strong and muscular, while the vendor was thin and frail, so he was no match. After being punched and kicked by the man, the vendor was knocked to the ground like the fruit in the basket. Suddenly, someone nearby became indignant and stepped forward to grab the man, asking why he was using his strength to bully others. They disagreed, and a fight broke out between them. This person was about as strong as the man, and they were evenly matched, fighting fiercely. The vendor had already gotten up from the ground, initially with a tearful face. Later, seeing the two men fighting intensely, he stood there foolishly, watching as if he found it very interesting. He even forgot that the fight had started because of him and forgot about the fruit and the basket rolling on the ground. By the time the fight was over and the crowd dispersed, the fruit had been trampled and the basket had been flattened.</p>
<p>This scene is symbolic of the case of the nine small islands of Yuehai being occupied by France. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs only issued a few protests when the news first came out. Later, when Japan came forward, it took the lead by occupying the islands, thus lodging a de facto protest. Our country then adopted a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, almost all the reports in the newspapers in the past half-month regarding this case have been about the arguments between Paris and Tokyo. Apart from telegrams from civil organizations requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to fight for the cause, there was no other news from our country.</p>
<p>The result of waiting and seeing will probably not deviate from the precedent of the fruit being trampled and the basket being flattened. Reuters has already told us that the Parisian officials are mostly silent about the Japanese representative's declaration to avoid escalating the situation. However, the French government may allow respect for Japan's economic interests while rejecting Japan's claim to political sovereignty. Naturally, it is not as easy to knock over an opponent who is about as strong as you are, as it is to knock over a thin and frail opponent.</p>

<h3>Would You Rather Be a Rich Family's Dog Than a Human Child?</h3>
<p>— Qian Yun Writes, Wen Liang Draws</p>
<p>The children of the Yang family suffer along with their father because he cannot earn money. Not to mention that they don't have the opportunity to study and learn to read, as there are countless children in China who are out of school. However, they are hungry several times a day, which is a problem they must solve every day. They are so hungry that tears stream from their eyes, but their father says he has no choice! Sometimes he even scolds them, and sometimes he hugs them and cries with them. The children's eyes narrow into slits when they cry, while the father's eyes widen like copper bells!</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the foreign dog of the Liu family has won the favor of its owner. Not only is it fed a dollar's worth of beef every day, but once when it was sick for a month, a famous veterinarian was hired. After daily diagnosis and treatment, the medical bill came to over two thousand five hundred taels, perhaps because the veterinarian was so famous. Narrow-minded friends cannot help but ask why he is willing to spend so much money on a dog. He replies: "There's no other reason, it's just that it's 'extremely clever'." This is not a problem for a rich family. Moreover, the Liu family probably also does a lot of good deeds worth tens of millions. However, compared to the children of the Yang family, it is still an absolutely wonderful contrast.</p>
<p>From this perspective, one can say that calling someone a "dog" is not necessarily an exclusively insulting term.</p>
<h3>Under the Thighs</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The times are constantly advancing. Our secret history has gone from pomegranate skirts to long cheongsams to bare thighs.</p>
<p>These thighs, with their smooth skin, curving lines, stepping on high heels, slightly revealed beneath the long cheongsam, are so alluring! So sensual! Even if you are Liu Xiahui, even if you are a man of Lu, even if you are an old Confucian scholar eating cold meat in Sanjiacun, even if you are an old eunuch in the past palace, you still have to take the opportunity to glance at them a few times. I have never heard of anyone who glances at them without feeling a sense of infatuation and distraction.</p>
<p>Since thighs have such charm, any film that has a few pairs of plump, white, and tender thighs captured in the lens will be able to sell seats and satisfy people's appetites. The star dancers in dance troupes must publicly bare their jade legs to captivate and inspire people, causing them to drool. The condition for modern women is to bare their legs under long cheongsams. Thighs! Bare thighs! They are the pride of the twentieth century. How many people have fallen for them, praised them, pursued them, and even sacrificed everything for them. And the harvest under the thighs is money, jewels, clothing, and everything else. There are also countless toads staring with their eyes wide open and their bellies bulging, worshiping under the thighs. The power of the thighs is great! The vast majority of beings chant in unison: "Great! Great!"</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>The same thighs, different values. The thighs of country folk.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>The same thighs, different loves and hates. Those powdered and jade-like thighs, which are also thighs that consume and distribute profit, are pursued and worshiped. Those thighs covered in mud are also thighs that are powerful for production, but they are disgusted and despised. Alas! This is also the mystery of the times!</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fourteen: Difficulties in Finding a Wife, Hesitant and Anxious About the Future, Inviting Friends for a Small Gathering, Shyly Recalling Past Events</p>
<p>Ms. Jiang said, "Cousin, since you have something to do, you don't have to stay here today. You can go back to the camp for now, and we can talk another day." Guan Yaowu stood up and laughed! "To be honest, as long as Aunt has a word, I will have fulfilled my responsibility. As for talking today or another day, I don't mind." After saying this, he went to the Zhao family in the backyard with a smile. Old Man Zhao briefly told Guan Yaowu about the situation in the past two days, which made him even more confident that the matter had a high chance of success. He returned to the camp with abundant joy. As soon as he entered the company headquarters, Zhao Ziqiang followed him in and laughed, "Brother, how is it going? There shouldn't be any problems, right?" Guan Yaowu slowly took off his military cap and placed it on the small table, looking at Zhao Ziqiang with a faint smile on his face. Zhao Ziqiang said, "What are you smiling at? It's just marrying a wife and raising children. Who doesn't do that? There's nothing to laugh about." Guan Yaowu laughed, "I'm not laughing at anything else. I'm laughing at you for celebrating your eightieth birthday on New Year's Eve, running into such a commotion. Any other time would have been fine to talk about a wife, but you just had to run into the day of this grand review. You have to take care of both official and private matters. I had to pay out of my own pocket to buy white sheets because there weren't enough. Now I'm going to be in debt again. Review, review. The commotion is making people suffer. You still have the energy to think about a wife." Zhao Ziqiang said, "What can we do if we run into this day? I think our battalion is also short of too many people. Otherwise, we could learn from the First Battalion and borrow people from other companies. That would be the best way. If a company is short thirty people, we can report ten or eight people as orderlies, and then borrow twenty people to make up the numbers. No one will know. These new recruits we temporarily hired are killing us to train." Guan Yaowu sighed and said, "These committee officials only look at the surface. What can we do? (170)"</p>
<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<h3>Summer Retreat</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The setting sun was swallowed up by the Western Hills, and the slender willow branches were hung with a plain moon. At the same time, the summer heat was taken away by the red sun, and cool breezes came with the plain moon. The children, having finished their meals and bathed, came to the alley to enjoy the cool air and play. Because they saw each other every night, they were as close as siblings. They put their arms around each other's shoulders, held hands, sang and danced together, played the harmonica, and played hide-and-seek. Often, they were so happy that they forgot to go to bed until late at night, and their mothers and sisters had to come and take them home one by one. One evening, on a bright moonlit night, after they had jumped and laughed for a while, Xiumei gathered everyone and suggested, "We play like this every day, and it feels a bit boring. Tonight, I want to change things up and have a summer retreat. I don't know if everyone agrees." Qiuxia was the first to shout, "I agree! Raise your hand!" She also asked, "How exactly will this retreat be held?" Xiumei then said, "Let's each sing and tell stories, but they must contain a cold meaning, so that everyone who hears them will feel cool." Everyone cheered, "That's really interesting! Come on! Come on!"</p>
<p>Xiumei was the initiator and was chosen to go first. She was already in junior high school and was a grown-up. She stood up gracefully and said, "Dear children! Yesterday, I went to the Northeast. Changbai Mountain was covered in white snow. The cold wind howled, and it was so cold that my nose almost fell off. I walked north through the wind and snow, shrinking my hands and neck. When I arrived at the Songhua River, I saw that the wide river had turned into a flat road. It had actually frozen into thick ice. Long-distance buses were running back and forth on it. I felt strange, so I walked up to it. But I lost my footing and fell. When I opened my eyes, I was lying in bed. It was just a dream!" Everyone said, "Cold! Cold! The Northeast is so cold!"</p>
<p>The second one was Little Goryeo. He was a Korean, so everyone gave him this nickname. He sang mischievously, "The cold wind is blowing, the cold rain is bleak." He sang clearly and melodiously, and it was very cold. Everyone clapped and said, "The Cold Clothes Song is well sung! Sing on!" But he said with a grin, "It's not cold below, so I won't sing anymore." So everyone said, "Little Goryeo, you're a bad egg."</p>
<p>"The accumulated snow buries the instep, the firm ice is on the beard, the fierce birds leave their nests, the horses hesitate, the monk's cotton robe is not warm, the fingers crack the skin," Chun Guan, who had read the lament for ancient battlefields, recited the above sentences. Some people clamored that they didn't understand, so Xiumei stood up and explained them to them. Everyone said, "This kind of fighting is really freezing people to death!"</p>
<p>Xuezhen stood up and said, "Last winter, I brought a piece of ice back from outside, and when I got home, I broke it into pieces on the ground. My little brother saw the ice sugar all over the ground and grabbed it to eat it. But when he put it in his mouth, he opened his mouth and cried, and I laughed. Everyone laughed, 'Frozen to death, the retribution for being greedy.'"</p>
<p>Xiao Mao wanted to speak a long time ago. Now it was his turn, and he jumped up and said, "Have you ever heard of someone freezing to death in June?" Everyone said, "Stop talking nonsense!" He said, "Who's talking nonsense? The teacher told us about it. During the Qing Dynasty, there was a Xue Fucheng, and the emperor sent him to foreign countries to investigate. When he came back to Guangdong, it was the month of June, and it was unbearably hot. The Guangdong officials, because he was an imperial envoy, tried their best to entertain him and specially built an ice room for him to live in. But it was too cold, and he got sick and died. So everyone said that Xue Fucheng was frozen to death in June." The children said in unison, "Strange, strange! Interesting, interesting!"</p>
<p>Xin Nv only read in the first grade, and she also stood up and said, "Snowflakes fly, dogs are happy." Everyone laughed, "Xin Nv is also happy."</p>
<p>A Fu was used to reading idle books at the small book stall at the alley entrance. When it was his turn, he blurted out, "In the twelfth month, snowflakes fly, Meng Jiangnu goes out to deliver cold clothes." When he sang to this point, he laughed before everyone else did.</p>
<p>Finally, it was Xi Liang's turn. I don't know when he got a handful of white paper scraps. He stood up and pretended to be frightened and said, "It's snowing outside!" Everyone really looked out of the alley. Taking advantage of this, he grabbed a handful of shredded paper and scattered it upwards, shouting, "The snow is so heavy!" The paper scraps fell piece by piece, and everyone really thought it was snowing, so they grabbed low stools and ran home. Seeing everyone running away, he laughed heartily. It turned out that everyone had heard so many cold songs and stories, and their minds had already changed, so when they saw white flakes falling from above, they thought it was really snowing.</p>
<p>Xiumei said, "It's getting late, everyone else has gone home, we should also go to sleep and see you tomorrow!" So everyone went home happily. Suddenly, the alley was silent, and only the bright moon was still shining brightly, and the clear wind was still blowing gently.</p>
<h3>New Opening Chapter for the Double Seventh Festival</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>The seventh day of the seventh month is today. The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd meet on the Magpie Bridge.</p>
<p>The Milky Way is full of moonlight. The wind is calm and there are few waves. The two meet and talk a lot of love. The autumn weather is pleasant and carefree. Weaver Girl, this year we are happy to celebrate the National Goods Year. Your clothes are definitely fashionable national goods. You advocate for the recovery of rights. I admire my wife as a patriotic female compatriot. Your bust is prominent and your legs are exposed in a modern style. You are especially beautiful compared to those years. Thinking that we have been apart for a year and meet today. Tonight is once a year. Cowherd, the country is in turmoil and it is difficult to find fun. China is really too bad. Although the northeast situation has subsided, it is a pity that the four provinces are already unstable. Let's wait until next year to order the Taoyao again. Oh, Weaver Girl, tonight we can only talk about romance. Why bother talking about national affairs? At this moment, the Cowherd wants to hug your slender waist. (This opening chapter will be personally sung and broadcasted at the Hengsen Radio Station from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM today. Radio wave 1420)</p>

<h3>Experts to Edit Syllabi for Vocational Courses</h3>
<p>Vocational School Graduates Will Also Take Entrance Examinations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has convened meetings multiple times to formulate and announce curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools. It will also begin to invite experts to organize a drafting committee to revise the curriculum standards for normal schools, so that normal schools across the country will have a basis to follow and seek uniformity. However, vocational schools have never had concrete curriculum standards since their establishment. Because vocational school curricula and levels are extremely inconsistent, it is difficult to set a common standard for all schools to follow uniformly. However, primary and secondary schools already have curriculum standards, and normal schools will also have entrance examinations in the future after curriculum standards are formulated, so that they can be promoted to higher education. How can vocational schools be unique? Therefore, vocational curricula must eventually be appropriately summarized and analyzed to gradually concretize them in order to seek universal adaptation. It is reported that the Ministry of Education will not organize a separate committee for the editing of vocational curricula. Instead, it will send letters to scholars and experts from vocational schools across the country, requesting them to draft outlines of various vocational curricula separately. The Ministry of Education will gather opinions and make a final decision. It is also reported that the Ministry of Education is also planning to carry out this matter.</p>

During his trip, Wang, appreciating the beauty of the Min River scenery, made great efforts to create works in the clear weather, rain, morning, and evening, writing dozens of oil paintings, watercolor paintings, and ink paintings of the three mountains in Fuzhou City, ⑴ Yu Mountain, ⑵ Ping Mountain, ⑶ Wushi Mountain, and Cangqian Mountain in Nantai, and Songquan of Gu Mountain, the peaks of Gu Ridge, the ships of Mawei, and the clear currents of Hongshan. Jiang Guangnai, the chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, admired Wang's works very much and specially commissioned Wang to paint four murals for the Provincial Government: ⑴ Yu Mountain White Pagoda, ⑵ Yongquan of Gu Mountain, ⑶ Hongshan of Min River, ⑷ Luo Shengtower of Mawei. The specified format is very large. Wang has returned to Shanghai by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Taishun ship yesterday (26th). It is reported that he brought back dozens of new works of the Min River scenery as a reference for making murals.</p>

<h3>Robertson Cup Preliminary Round: Great Britain Eliminates United States</h3>
<p>Straight Sets in Three</p>
<p>| China vs. Portugal Match on Wednesday |</p>
<p>In the Robertson Cup international doubles competition, Great Britain played the United States in the preliminary round yesterday. Great Britain's Stockes and Corlecko eliminated the United States' Squires and Smith with scores of 6-2, 6-2, 6-3. The match between China and Portugal was originally scheduled for yesterday but was postponed due to a conflict with the Rotary Cup. The two sides have now decided to hold the match on Wednesday afternoon at the China Tennis Court. The Chinese players are initially set to be Qiu Feihai and Zheng Zhaojia, but there are recent talks of changing the lineup to Qiu paired with Jiang Daozhang.</p>
<h3>Rotary Cup: China Still Able to Retain Championship in Shanghai International Tennis</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Doubles: China Wins Straight Sets Against Portugal in Three</p>
<p>Corlachea Wins 3-1 Against Wang Wenzheng</p>
<p>Today: Zheng Zhaojia in Dramatic Battle Against Corlachea</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng to Play Against Xun Na: Expected to Win</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng embraced a do-or-die spirit yesterday, hoping to subdue Corlachea in one fell swoop, but his fierce strokes were all broken by Corlachea. As a result, Wang's plan failed, and he ultimately lost. Corlachea won the fourth set with a score of 9-7, adding up to the results of the match held the previous day. Corlachea won with scores of 6-3, 6-4, 0-6, 9-7.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Robertson Cup Shanghai International Tennis Tournament. In addition to the match between Corlachea and Wang, which was not completed due to darkness on the first day and was continued yesterday, the main match was doubles. Both matches were very important, and the outcome of the match between Corlachea and Wang Wenzheng was of particular concern to the audience. Therefore, the China Tennis Court was even more crowded yesterday, and people did not fear the scorching sun.</p>
<p>In the doubles match, China still consisted of the old partners Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang. Portugal's lineup was still S Corlachea and Kosta. At the start, the Portuguese players were very sharp. In addition, Zheng Zhaojia's hand movements were not smooth, and he frequently lost points, while Yu Tianguang's work in front of the net was excellent, and his strokes were very sharp, greatly praised by the audience. Portugal took the lead with 4-2. Later, Zheng gradually recovered his original state, and finally won with 6-4, reversing the defeat. In the second and third sets, Yu Tianguang was still strong and did not decrease in the slightest. Zheng Zhaojia's hand movements gradually became skilled, and his sharpness gradually emerged. His serve was most praised. The two cooperated skillfully and defended the net firmly, winning three consecutive sets, with scores of 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.</p>

<p>Today is the last two singles matches. There is no question that China will retain the championship. Although Wang Wenzheng lost one singles match to Corlachea, he can steadily win against Xun Na. Since the doubles match was won by China yesterday, China has steadily taken three groups. Portugal's hopes are completely extinguished. However, the outcome of today's match between Zheng Zhaojia and Corlachea, although it does not affect the championship, the performance of the two is worth noting. Corlachea once defeated Machida, a Shanghai intercity player from Japan, in the preliminary round, and also won 3-1 against Wang Wenzheng. In the preliminary round of the senior singles, Corlachea also defeated Liang Deguang, with a score of 3-2. Zheng Zhaojia once defeated Liang Deguang in the Youyou Cup, but lost to Wang Wenzheng in the final of the China Open singles. Based on this record, it is unknown who will win between Corlachea and Zheng. But in terms of hitting method, Zheng Zhaojia seems to be able to beat Corlachea. What will happen after all, viewers are waiting to see.</p>
<h3>Corlachea Actually Wins</h3>
<p>(Wang Wenzheng's Wisdom and Strategies Exhausted) The match between Wang and Corlachea was not able to finish the other day, the score being 3-6, 4-6, 6-0, 6-6. Yesterday at 3:30 PM, the game continued. Wang, for the sake of caution, specially arrived at the court in advance to practice with others to loosen his wrists and to boost morale. The original referee was Bode, but he was unable to come due to personal reasons, so Jiang Daozhang took his place. The linesmen were also replaced by two people. After the start of the match, Wang launched lightning-like strokes, breaking Corlachea's serve. The audience was delighted by this. Unexpectedly, Wang's serve was easily lost, making the score 7-7. Corlachea proceeded cautiously, using a slice to obtain a dangerous opportunity, but things did not go as desired. With one or two strokes, Corlachea finally won this game and this set and this match. During the match, when Wang's ball went out of bounds, the linesman yelled, but Corlachea also made a "out of bounds" sound at the same time, which was not appropriate.</p>
<h3>Doubles Match Won Back by China</h3>
<p>(Yu Tianguang Particularly Pleasing) Portugal, after Corlachea's win in singles, quite wanted to get their hands on the championship. If the Portuguese team had won the doubles and Corlachea also won against Zheng Zhaojia, they would have high hopes for winning the championship. However, whether Corlachea can win against Zheng Zhaojia is questionable. The Portuguese doubles team is not a first-rate team, so their hopes are just dreams. After the beginning, because of Zheng Zhaojia's frequent mistakes, the Portuguese players got the upper hand, taking the lead with 3-1 and 4-2. However, Zheng and Yu broke this later, taking three consecutive sets. Yu Tianguang's performance in this match was particularly pleasing. His skills in front of the net were excellent. Whether it was high pressure or low blocking, he was very confident. He often attacked the opponent's backhand, and every move was surprisingly effective, winning great praise from the audience. Zheng Zhaojia was mediocre. He made more mistakes in the first set. From the second set to the third set, Zheng gradually recovered his original state. His serve was as heavy as a cannonball, and his blocking was also measured. He also shot balls sharp as arrows towards the boundary, and he received much praise from the audience. But it is a strange thing that Zheng and Yu are both good at backhand strokes, but often make mistakes in forehands.</p>
<p>(Straight Sets, Easy and Comfortable) The Portuguese players took the lead. Corlachea obtained the serve. Zheng Zhaojia also obtained the serve. The Portuguese players then added two more games, making the score 3-1, then 4-2. The Portuguese players were very imposing. The audience was amazed by this. But looking at their performance, it is difficult for them to win the final victory. Therefore, the next four games were won by Zheng and Yu, ending with 6-4. In the second set, after Kosta won the serve, Zheng and Yu added three consecutive games. Then each won with their serve, making the score 5-3. The Chinese team broke Kosta's serve again, winning the set again with 6-3. In the third set, Zheng and Yu were in full bloom. Corlachea only obtained his two serves, and all the rest belonged to China. China then won again with 6-2.</p>
<h3>There Will Be a Dramatic Battle in Today's Singles</h3>
<p>(There Will Be a Dramatic Battle Between Zheng and Corlachea) Today is the last day of this year's Rotary Cup. The last two singles matches between China and Portugal will be held at the China Tennis Court at 4 PM. There is no problem with Wang Wenzheng winning against Xun Na. The match between Zheng Zhaojia and Corlachea will definitely be a wonderful and intense competition and is worthy of attention. Who will win is another matter. After the game, Zhu Ziquan, the vice president of the Rotary Club, the host of the Rotary Cup, will present the awards on the spot.</p>

<p>Sea Swim to be Held Today</p>
<h3>Two Thousand Meter Sea Course</h3>
<p>The first Takahashi 2,000-meter sea swim race is scheduled to start this afternoon. Swimmers, such as Mr. Shi Xinglong, the national swimming champion, long-distance swimming experts Xu Huaiqing and Wang Yusheng, and returned overseas Chinese Liang Xinhao, and Western youth McLeese, have signed up. The competition is expected to be intense. Public buses can now go directly to the seaside, making transportation very convenient.</p>
<p>Important Notice: The wind and waves in the sea are very dangerous. More than one hundred Chinese and Western players have joined, but there are few rescue boats planned. In addition to doing our best to send people to rescue, there are many people and few boats, so it is inevitable to lose sight of the other. Our association has the responsibility to promote sports, but it is difficult to guarantee the safety of life. I hope that those who are not good at swimming will not take the risk of self-destruction.</p>

<p>Hong Xianfang Will Additionally Present Small Champagnes</p>
<p>The Xian Fang Cup Tennis League, which has been running for half a month in a round-robin format, has fortunately benefited from good weather, with few matches hindered by rain.

After these remaining matches are played, the tournament will come to a successful conclusion. Yesterday's match between Railway and You You was deemed an exceptionally dramatic battle. The rest were also full of highlights. However, Xia Guang abandoned the match due to insufficient players, which was a great pity. It is said that Mr. Hong Xianfang, the initiator of the cup (and also the re-elected chairman of the Shanghai China Tennis Association), was very pleased to see this and generously agreed to donate silver "small champagne" cups as awards for the singles and doubles winners in each group.

Regarding physical education, various military units are preparing to send athletes to participate in the upcoming National Games. Chairman Chiang intends to return to Nanjing at that time to attend and provide encouragement. If the military and the people jointly promote sports, the widespread popularization of sports in our country can be expected in the near future.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts in July</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The seventh month of the lunar calendar is indeed the best time of the year, the so-called "Cool weather and cold weather" season. Therefore, folk legends and stories about July are particularly numerous. It is natural for poets, with their sensitivity, to feel melancholy about the desolation of the autumn wind. As for why ordinary people, lacking such acute sensitivity, would also sing praises of July, it seems that it is none other than the fact that the busy farming season is over, the weather is cool, and they can enjoy the fruits of their labor in peace. However, in modern China, where floods and droughts turn bountiful harvests into disasters and the countryside goes bankrupt, how farmers feel about autumn may still be a question.</p>
<p>The most poetic of the folk legends in July is, of course, the story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl on the Double Seventh Festival. Lafcadio Hearn (Koizumi Yakumo) has a book of "Galaxy Stories," which recounts the elegant customs in Japanese villages on the evening of the Double Seventh Festival, where people hang five-colored poems on bamboo poles and throw them into clear streams to be carried away by the water. He also translated several ancient Japanese songs in it.</p>
<p>Next is the Ullambana Festival on the fifteenth day of July. The origin of this custom is likely based on the story of Maudgalyāyana saving his mother from the Ullambana Sutra. However, it later became increasingly elaborate, involving intricate techniques such as carving wood and bamboo, and cutting colored sugar and wax to create shapes of flowers and leaves. In Japanese villages, on the evening of the fifteenth of July, there is also a custom of men and women dancing wildly until dawn, called Bon Odori. I have had the opportunity to witness this several times in Nikko and Shiobara and found that the primitive dancing of the farmers, combined with the atmosphere of rustic men and women singing and joking, created a kind of indescribable joy. I wonder if these surviving customs from July in Japan are our own domestic products from the Sui and Tang dynasties. I would very much like to consult scholars of textual research on this point.</p>
<p>Further embellishments derived from the story of Maudgalyāyana saving his mother include the releasing of river lanterns and the planting of Jizo incense on the thirtieth of July. In the past, when I resided on the north bank of Shichahai in Beiping, every autumn, walking past the Jingye Nunnery in Jishuitan would remind me of Wang Cihui's quatrain "River Lanterns at Jingye Nunnery on an Autumn Night." I have heard that Shaoxing has large-scale Maudgalyāyana opera troupes and scripts. I wonder if this Maudgalyāyana opera is also an amateur pastime for farmers in Shaoxing during July.</p>
<h3>Nankou Apples</h3>
<p>— Li Tiao</p>
<p>Nankou not only produces apples but also many other fruits such as apricots, grapes, crabapples, and peaches. However, when I vowed to spend a day in Nankou, it happened to be the season when apples were ripening.</p>
<p>As soon as the train stopped, the hawkers' shouts outside the platform pierced my ears like scolding. I don't understand why Northerners are so extreme in their emotions, even shouting sales pitches so loudly, as if threatening people to buy their goods. Some set up stalls outside the wooden fence, clinging to the fence and shouting at the passengers on the train. Others, with one hand clinging to the fence and their feet on the horizontal bars, leaned their bodies inward, while the other hand stretched out their goods to get closer to the customers getting off the train. They thought that being near the water tower, they would be the first to benefit. The customers would surely take care of their business first. However, this kind intention was often not accepted. Customers getting off the train would often glance at them disdainfully and run to the stalls outside the fence to bargain. Thus, they had no choice but to shout and wave their outstretched hands holding the goods to the next customer.</p>
<p>The goods, apart from the occasional cooked chicken, soy milk, rice porridge, and buns, were mostly fruit. And what I want to talk about are apples. As soon as you leave Beiping to the west, the scenery becomes scorched yellow. But Nankou has round, reddish-pink apples, like the delicate cheeks of a sixteen-year-old girl, displayed in baskets and hampers, which are truly beautiful.</p>
<p>Fruit is a famous product of Nankou. This place has fresh and cheap seasonal fruits on the market for three seasons of the year. Apples are priced at three dimes for a large basket and two dimes for a small basket. Those who are not good at bargaining can get a large basket for two dimes, while those who are good at bargaining can get it for one dime and a half. Furthermore, shrewd old-timers would rather buy by the catty, as the price per catty is about the same, but it avoids the drawback of having rotten or inferior apples at the bottom. A large basket contains about eleven or twelve catties, using the sixteen-tael scale.</p>
<p>Fruit becomes more expensive as soon as it leaves Nankou, probably because fruit gradually loses its freshness after leaving the place of origin, so it becomes more valuable. Speaking of which, Nankou has the Ping Sui Railway connecting it to Beiping, and the train can arrive in an hour. However, the trains are often diverted for military use, and passenger trains are often delayed by three or four hours. Freight trains, because they have to wait for military trains to be towed, only get a locomotive to pull them after a delay of one or two days. They also have to give way to military trains on the road, and the locomotive has to go to pull military trains. So, when the fruit can be transported from Nankou to Beiping is unknown.</p>
<p>Nankou is surrounded by mountains, with fruit trees growing abundantly in the mountains, blooming and bearing fruit in beautiful scenery. Nankou also has ancient battlefields, with fortresses still standing and bullet marks still visible. There is also a memorial tower for fallen soldiers built of earth and stone, standing on the right side of the road. There are many such memorial towers in China - for the revolution, for martyrs, for suppressing △, for suppressing X - and many more can be built in the future. After visiting, I felt that the memorial towers in other places are built even better than this one.</p>
<p>There are many military trains and the apples are very cheap. The soldiers going west are going to fight against the "fake resistance against Japan," which is very good. The more military trains, the cheaper the apples, which is very beneficial for those passing by.</p>
<p>Now that there is no trouble over there, the military trains will be coming back! The apples will probably still be cheap.</p>
<h3>"Satisfaction" and "Cannot Write"</h3>
<p>— Sun Yong</p>
<p>It is natural that people who are satisfied with everything cannot write articles. Therefore, creation is precisely a symbol of distress.</p>
<p>However, in present-day China, it is quite strange that the so-called "literati" can actually utter the words "extremely satisfied" about this kind of life.</p>
<p>However, an ignorant and unknowledgeable young master actually said in a small newspaper: "I am a person who is extremely satisfied with life. I feel that people come into the world to enjoy themselves, not to suffer..." Naturally, the young master who relies on his ancestors' legacy and his wife's dowry to enjoy life has nothing to be dissatisfied with. But has he ever thought that in China, the vast majority of people do indeed come to suffer, not to enjoy? Some young people may boast that they are "truly handsome" gigolos, but it is also very clear that there are not many daughters of prime ministers with millions of dollars of dowries waiting for people to seduce them on the Shanghai Bund!</p>
<p>The young master also said: "I feel that suffering is also a privilege, and suffering is a destiny. Why can I endure suffering, but you cannot? ... If I have to suffer, I will suffer, and I do not want to express any dissatisfaction." This is actually not worth "writing out," because first, it reminds me of a satirical cartoon: a capitalist giving a speech to several workers, his speech being, "God said that mankind did not come into the world just for bread." (General idea). Secondly, I am also thinking of the inert brother-like-ist who believes that there is no need to destroy, no need to transform, and that the status quo is the best of all.</p>
<p>I looked again at his reasons for satisfaction. According to himself, he is neither "economically well-off" nor has he "never suffered," but it is because he is "worthy of himself" and "faithful to himself." To say "worthy of oneself" and "faithful to oneself" in more popular terms is called "selfish and self-interested." Of course, "selfish and self-interested" cannot write the poetry of a "prophet." Moreover, in present-day China, with even a little humanity, one cannot only care about oneself.</p>
<p>However, the young master's slogan is:</p>
<p>Satisfaction with life, I cannot write;</p>
<p>A world of enjoyment, I cannot write;</p>
<p>One joy in life, I cannot write;</p>
<p>There are many articles; I cannot write.</p>
<p>If you cannot write, then there is no need to embarrass yourself, you should go back to your old business, mixing cosmetics and creating seemingly understandable but actually meaningless poems, stealing the title of "poet" for your own amusement!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Mountain Tales (Continued)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>㈢ Answering Articles</p>
<p>When I saw the title "Answering Articles" in Ming Ren and Jiang Nanrong's "Chats of Half-Rustic Villagers," I was very happy. This refers to the affairs of Wang Zhongyi, Duke Ji. The text says: "Wang Zhongyi, Duke Ji, with his great achievements and outstanding virtues, stood out in his generation. Whenever someone asked for poetry or prose, he would compose it with a stroke of his pen, without giving it much thought. He once said to people, 'The honest writing of the North is not a model, it is only answering, even attaching the draft.' This shows the Duke's sincerity. However, the Duke's worthiness of remembrance does not depend on this."</p>
<p>"Only answering," this sentence is absolutely straightforward and incisive. In the collections of writers of the past, there are always inevitably articles that are "only answering," sometimes even many. Some writers, such as Zheng Banqiao, have even openly cursed against this, but what effect does it have? Writers still have to write articles that are "only answering." Such articles are not called "only answering" now. The most common term is "ghost-busting," "ghost-busting articles," or more elegantly, "occasional pieces," "fulfilling the matter." Literature has been revolutionized, literary language has become vernacular, but this kind of "fulfilling the matter," a disguised form of "only answering" articles, has consistently existed. Even a sage like Hu Shi, who opposed writing such articles, has not been able to avoid it to this day, let alone others? This kind of "only answering" article not only exists now but is also developing. It has developed to the point where people calling themselves writers are writing "only answering" articles to kill, to sing praises, to vent personal grievances. It can be said that in addition to the boring "only answering" articles for entertaining friends, a new system has now been added! "Blood-sucking articles"! Blood-sucking indeed, shameless indeed! (The End)</p>
<h3>Women (III)</h3>
<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>The patient, hearing this question, seemed to be reminded by it of unpleasant impressions from another time and another event, and asked the woman in return, "When are you leaving?"</p>
<p>The woman did not answer immediately, but raised her head and looked at the patient with her bright eyes for a while. Then, she drooped her head powerlessly, sighed softly, and said to herself, "When am I leaving?"</p>
<p>The patient understood the reason and said:</p>
<p>"It's alright not to leave! In August in XX, the scenery is beautiful everywhere. And didn't you say that when I get better, get out of the hospital, you would accompany me to spend time in XX?"</p>
<p>"To stay there for half a month? The leaves on the mountain there are extremely beautiful, I like those trees. If you leave, I don't want to go there alone. Why do you want to leave?"</p>
<p>The woman lowered her head, saying with a sense of sadness, "Why do I want to leave? I really don't know!"</p>
<p>The patient said:</p>
<p>"I remembered a poem of yours. That poem called 'The Mystery of the Seasonal Flowers,' I remember you so..." Unable to decide whether to say "lonely" or "sentimental," he changed his tone and said to the woman, "It must be very cold outside, why don't you wear your purple clothes?"</p>
<p>The woman pretended not to hear this sentence, listlessly twisting her gloves. After a while, she asked again, "After you get out of the hospital, do you plan to go to the mountain, or not?"</p>
<p>The patient seemed to have recalled everything from the past month in the hospital, and his heart softened. He quietly said, "If you don't leave, you come to the mountain with me, wouldn't that be good? You have to leave."</p>
<p>"I have to leave, yes, I have to leave."</p>
<p>"I want you to accompany me!"</p>
<p>"You don't need me to accompany you!"</p>
<p>"But you know..."</p>
<p>"But you..."</p>
<p>Nothing more needed to be said; both were rendered speechless by one thing.</p>
<p>She loved him, he understood; he did not love her, she also understood. The problem was in this. For three years, each person's position had remained the same, without much change.</p>
<p>Their ages differed by about seven years. This gap separated the friendship between these two people, causing them to stop at a certain thin curtain. Both were gazing at the other's emotional state, but often remained silently in a daze, unable to open their arms and allow the other to weakly and willfully lie in those arms.</p>
<p>(Summer, a hot, oppressive, and tiring summer.)</p>
<p>Three years ago, at a summer seaside academic conference in XX in the South, fifty young women and seventy young men gathered, setting up tents by the sea to live through the summer. These young men and women all came from various universities. In the morning, they gathered in the shade of trees and in temporary mat sheds to listen to lectures from famous professors from Beiping. In the afternoon, they would go to the seaside bathing beach for seawater baths. In the evening, they would put on plays, watch movies, and hold small group discussions and dance parties, while also gathering in smaller groups. On the beach and on the small hilltops, torches were often lit, and piles of firewood were burned to indicate the location of the camp to those boating at sea and those lost in the mountains.</p>
<p>Among the women, there was an outstanding figure. The daughter of a XX chief, born out of wedlock, and a third-year student at XX University. This woman was not only pure and beautiful in character and scholarship, but also exceptionally beautiful in appearance. She was skilled in swimming, horseback riding, boating, and ball games, surpassing others in every way. Moreover, she was exceptionally lively and lacked any frivolous habits. She was gentle and kind in her dealings with others, and was therefore admired by the entire group. In particular, one young professor and one middle-aged professor were extremely admiring of this woman. However, at that time, the girl seemed indifferent to all the courtesies. It was as if this person felt that she should always be admired by everyone, always belong to everyone, and could not be exclusively occupied by one person. Therefore, she remained solitary, never softened by any love.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial Exchange: Silver Futures Suddenly Rise, Standard Gold Drops 17.8 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market started to decline, due to the report of the British silver market shrinking and the American silver market rising. The British-American exchange rate rose by 5.625, with the US dollar surging against the British pound by 1.0255. Silver futures prices on the gold exchange rose by 6.7 to 8 percent. Stocks rose by 3.36 yuan. Panic spread through the market. The raw market opened and immediately fell to 20 yuan, with many stop-loss orders triggered, further pushing the price down to 17 yuan. After the opening, the price trended downward due to loosening in the domestic market. The HSBC exchange rate listing was announced, showing the British pound unchanged and the US dollar up by 0.625, resulting in stability. After hovering, the exchange market continued to tighten, with buyers actively replenishing their positions at lower prices to prevent exchange rate reversals. After a long struggle, the price finally exceeded the 20 yuan mark. Although there was a slight decline at the end, the overall situation was firm and market sentiment was good. Despite Reuters news reports that the Wheat Agreement had been signed at 10:30 PM on the 25th, and that the Liverpool wheat market was experiencing the effects of the Wheat Agreement's decision to establish a global market price and limit wheat supply, causing wheat prices to rise due to short covering, these news items did not have a significant impact. The clamshell red price increased by 230 yuan. The September-October swap price ranged from 7.2 to 7.5 yuan. The half-day market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 818.5 yuan, a decrease of 18.6 yuan from the previous closing. Goods opened at 8 yuan. The exchange market opened with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 3 pence, and the US dollar at 28.9375 yuan. Shunli, Yuanfeng, and Yongjin placed orders. Sumitomo bought US dollars for December delivery at 75 points, rising from 7.5 to 9.5 yuan. Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Zhifeng, Yongfuchang, Hongli, Yicheng, and Zhengchang sold. The exchange market was extremely loose, and even US dollars for December delivery at 8125 were difficult to sell, falling to 5.5 yuan. Hengxingsheng and Dabingxing replenished their short positions at low prices, rising to 2 yuan. However, Zhaofengchang and Dadecheng sold again, dropping the price to 5.2 yuan. The HSBC exchange rate listing was announced, showing the British pound unchanged and the US dollar up by 0.625. At this point, the price hovered around 7 yuan, as banks bought US dollars for December delivery at 875 points. Zhengjin ate US dollars for December delivery at 8125, while Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yu Bingxing, and Zhaofengchang all bought. Citibank and the Central Exchange Bureau traded US dollars for November delivery at 5625 points. Although Ruikang sold, the price still rose back to 9.7 yuan. Yifeng, Yongyuan, and Shengyong also bought, but the sale of limited order slips surged, making it difficult to exceed the 20 yuan mark. After circling, Huabi ate US dollars for December delivery at 75 points. It was now difficult to settle Yuanheng's order, and the price soared to 20.05 yuan. Richang exited, and Zhengjin took delivery of US dollars for December at 6875. At this time, the price struggled around 20 yuan. Citibank sold US dollars for November delivery at 5625 points. Yuansheng, Yongfu, Yu Yuanxing, and Yonghengxing, etc., all supplied half a yuan and 5625 points for November delivery, causing the price to fall to 18 yuan. Dachangxiang, goods, and Wanxing Shunli jointly purchased. After this, there were many advances and retreats. At the noon closing, the price was 819.3 yuan. After the closing, although Yuanxingyong sold, Wanxing bought vigorously, pushing the price above 20 yuan. Goods were then traded at 20 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 820.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 815.2 yuan, with a fluctuation of 5.3 yuan. As a result, the price decreased by 17.8 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The listed exchange rate was 28.875 yuan, with HSBC's US dollar listing up by 0.625, equivalent to a standard gold price of 831.17 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 12 yuan per tael, slightly less squeezed compared to the previous closing. The registered price for this month was 830 yuan, 825 yuan for September, and 819 yuan for October. The supplementary water price for the morning was 830 yuan. The clamshell red price increased by 230 yuan. The market was very quiet. Afterwards, the Tianjin gang continued to supply, with transaction prices ranging from 240 yuan to 44 yuan, supplied by Yingfeng, Hengtong, and Fenghheng. The transaction volume was close to 1,000 taels. For the September-October swap, Changshengyong paid Qianchangxiang 302 slips at 7.5 yuan. Dachangxiang paid Qianchangxiang 245 slips at 7.2 yuan. Ruikang paid Qianchangxiang 42 slips at 7.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still active. In summary, Wanxingsheng, Dabingxing Shunli, Hengxing, Changshengyong, Ruixing, Yuanheng, Qianchangxiang, Dachangxiang, Zhaofengchang, Zhifengyong, etc., were on the buying side, while Dadecheng, Ruikang, Yuanxingyong, Tongyi, Shenkangfu, Yuhongli, Yicheng, etc., were on the selling side. The Dalian gang, Wanxing, bought over 1,800 and sold over 900. Shunli bought over 1,400 and sold over 1,200. The Guangdong gang, Hengxing, also bought, but sold again after the price increased. Shengshengda bought, with Hengxing buying over 200 slips and selling less than 200 slips. Shengshengda bought over 200 slips. There were 763 slips remaining for this month, and 2,394 slips for September.</p>

After the opening, the price hovered and firmed. The HSBC listing did not move the shilling, and the US dollar rose by more than half a yuan. After the announcement, it gradually became peaceful. Later, with banks having a healthy appetite, it gradually tightened. Finally, banks traded with each other. At the noon closing, the near-term selling price was one shilling, two pence, and 9375 for the British exchange, and 29.0625 yuan for the US exchange, with the British pound stable and the US dollar firm at 0.625 compared to the previous closing.

Banks such as Zhengjin and Huabi bought a lot, while HSBC and Citibank sold a lot. The Central Exchange Company bought US dollars vigorously.

<h3>Interest Rates Unchanged, Clearing Simplified</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, a typically slow day, banks were only open for half a day. Due to time constraints, many clearing and settlement matters were often not handled and were delayed. This was a common occurrence, but the amounts were generally small. Trading in the market and discount transactions were also very quiet. Transfers totaled just over 4.1 million, new transactions over 800,000, noon transactions just over 200,000, and small syndicate transactions over 400,000. Interest rates remained unchanged, with both morning and afternoon rates at 6 percent. Head-scratching was also pointless, with no added water. Bank clearings included weak foreign merchant bill payments of 1 million and over 1.5 million in foreign currency. Various merchandise exchange, mortgage, and miscellaneous payments totaled around 2 million in silver and over 2.2 million in foreign currency. Special clearings totaled over 1.2 million in silver. Warehouse inflows and outflows were balanced, with 300,000 in foreign currency flowing in. Chinese commercial bank clearings included bill payments of 1.7 to 1.8 million, various merchandise exchange, tax, and miscellaneous payments of 3.5 to 3.6 million, and special clearings of over 1.5 million. 500,000 flowed out of the warehouse. Japanese commercial bank outflows included 200,000 in silver and 400,000 in foreign currency. Private money shops' foreign currency public order clearings totaled over 34 million, foreign currency head-scratching clearings over 4.8 million, remittance payments from various regions over 500,000, cash receipts of 500,000 to 600,000, foreign currency mortgage inflows and outflows over 600,000, and banknote withdrawals and issuances over 1.2 million. There were no reports of inbound or outbound stomach problems. Furthermore, the total amount exchanged at the local clearinghouse on the 26th was 3,766,205.81 yuan in silver dollars, including 1,295,696.47 yuan in silver dollars and 2,470,509.34 yuan in exchange silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Auxiliary Silver Dollar Rises, Copper Coins Fall</h3>
<p>Recently, auxiliary coins have been relatively stable after some ups and downs. Yesterday, small silver dollars from southern Jiangsu were 844.6 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, slightly better by 0.6 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were 6,000 jiao in the morning and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon. Small silver dollars from Guangdong were 780.01 yuan in the morning and 780.06 yuan in the afternoon, down 0.04 yuan. Transactions were 45,000 jiao in the morning and 75,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins remained unchanged at 316,000 wen, with 44,240 strings traded, valued at 14,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds See Mixed Performance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange was in its last day of trading for August futures. Major traders, except for those who had already swapped or squared off their positions, were generally prepared for delivery, so there was no sign of mutual squeeze in the market. As a result, market prices remained very stable. Deliveries were scheduled for the 30th. Only September contracts were traded next Monday, and October contracts were added from Tuesday. Yesterday, the market seemed to have some short squeeze momentum in the morning session, and the buying and selling activities of various gangs were also considerable. Market prices, except for the disarmament bond, which saw a small swap of about 0.1 yuan on the long side, generally rose by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. After the afternoon opening, the aforementioned varieties continued to see a slight increase of about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Starting from the 20th level, swaps on the long side were still more urgent than on the short side, so market prices softened again and slightly decreased by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The market was even flatter at the closing, about 0.05 to 0.1 yuan lower. The overall result was very chaotic, with market prices showing mixed performance, with increases ranging from 0.05 to 0.3 yuan and decreases ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. This was entirely due to the different swaps on the long and short sides, so the trend was slightly chaotic. The total trading volume was 9,362,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods, 3,025,000 in salt tax, 1,005,000 in disarmament bonds, 1,835,000 in 96 bonds, 935,000 in 19 customs bonds, 1,360,000 in 20-volume 20 customs bonds, and the rest ranging from tens of thousands to 350,000.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Turns Firm</p>
<h3>Wheat Agreement Signed</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Friday (the 25th), the New York stock market rose sharply as the Federal Reserve Bank purchased government bonds to expand credit, causing the US exchange rate to weaken. The London Wheat Agreement and short covering further fueled the market rally. Most stocks rose by 1 to 6 yuan. The Holmes Stock Gold Mine stock rose from 224 yuan to 296 yuan, a rapid rise that set a new record in history. The total trading volume for the day was 6.33 million shares. Wheat opened high due to rumors of an agreement on the British pound at the World Wheat Conference and favorable domestic news for the long side. However, the price softened later as buyers were scarce and sellers gradually increased. As a result, it rose by slightly less than 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day. Cotton also firmed up due to credit expansion and a strong stock market. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 105.07 Up 3.66</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 53.37 Up 2.28</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 31.18 Up 0.95</p>
<p>40 Bonds 87.58 Down 0.10</p>
<h3>Yarn: Some Factories Sell Off in the Yarn and Flower Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market was flat and the situation softened, as some factories sold off thousands of bales, which pressured the market. However, many outside investors believed that the bottom was weak and took long positions, so although the market was weak, the downtrend did not materialize. Some speculated that after a certain important figure returned to China, measures would be taken to support the yarn market (yarn fell by 0.2 to 0.6 yuan). The opening of the previous market was very flat. Although American cotton rose and the exchange rate increased, market sentiment was lukewarm. Prices for each month fell by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan. In the afternoon, prices for each month rose slightly by 0.1 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 31,200 bales. Ruida sold 1,600 bales, Changfeng sold 1,250 bales, Xiesheng sold 1,100 bales, Dafeng sold 700 bales, and Chunji sold 700 bales. Yuanda bought 1,300 bales, Renfeng bought 750 bales, Dachang bought 700 bales, Yongchang bought 650 bales, and Shenchang bought 600 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Closing Prices, Increases and Decreases, and Open Interest: November 1870 Down 0.3 44,050</p>
<p>August 1801 Down 0.6 15,950 December 1877 0.3 47,500</p>
<p>September 1839 0.4 65,500 January 1890 0.2 47,5000</p>
<p>October 1857 0.2 58,650 Total 279,150</p>
<p>(Yarn Sales 415 bales) Spot yarn sales were flat. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 415 bales throughout the day.</p>
<p>Market conditions were flat, and the purchase amounts of each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>North Gang 10 Shantou 5 Mainland 150 Ningbo 45 Wuhu 3</p>
<p>Xiamen 5 Guangdong 100 Yunnan 80 Fujian 7</p>
<h3>Buyers Squeeze High Standard Cotton</h3>
<p>August Chen cotton was in its last day, and buyers were determined to squeeze the price higher. The highest price seen was 49.8 yuan. In the last session of the afternoon, long positions were released, with frantic bidding up to 41 or 42 yuan. The situation was very chaotic for a time, and the noise was deafening. Buyers saw that the downtrend was too strong and repurchased 5,000 piculs, which were traded at 49.5 yuan. New cotton futures were still dependent on favorable weather, and buyers were relatively scarce, so although American cotton rose and the gold market fell, the market atmosphere was stable.</p>
<p>(Cotton Slightly Down) The opening of the Zheng Standard market was flat, as the increase in foreign cotton and the lengthening of the exchange rate did not change the calculations. Buyers were not numerous, and prices for each month fell by 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, long positions bought and added to their positions, and prices for each month rose by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan.

<h3>Japanese Merchants Buying American Cotton in the South</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 25th reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that the cotton market was relatively calm last week. The liquidation of long positions and increased hedging prevented it from rebounding. However, the price decline was offset by buying from dealers and brokers. The market was clearly hovering due to the increased movement of new cotton and the possibility of currency inflation. There was growing concern about new cotton, as the breeding of fruit worms was a serious concern. According to news from the Southwest, Japanese merchants were buying early cotton in Texas, offering higher prices than Europe. Local factories were not paying much attention to spot goods because they were unwilling to pay the 4.2-point handling fee before their products were sold. The cotton goods market was extremely quiet, and sporadic transactions were still good. It was currently uncertain whether the price increases needed after the cost increase would have an immediate impact.</p>

<h3>Grains and Flour Sales Are Smooth, Standard Flour Returns to Firmness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for each month generally appeared stable. Foreign wheat prices were reported with Chicago rebounding 9 to 12 points, and Canada up about 4 points. After opening prices, the market for each month immediately appeared better by about 1 point. Later, due to overbuying and selling, the trend loosened again. Until the afternoon opening, it was still sluggish at first, then gradually returned to firmness, because manufacturers' chips for this month were gradually collected. Due to the movements of north road customer gangs, the atmosphere for the forward months felt stable. It was also reported that the spot sales market in Tianjin was relatively smooth, with daily sales reaching over 60,000, and prices also rising slightly by 1 or 2 points. The change in people's minds was probably due to this. As a result, the current month and September were better by 0.05, October was better by 0.075, November was better by 0.025, December was better by 0.05, and January was better by 0.01.</p>
<h3>Recent Wheat Short Covering Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, prices for each month were generally flat. Foreign wheat prices were reported with Chicago rising 9 to 12 points, and Canada rising by up to 4 points. Therefore, after opening prices, the momentum was initially good, but then it returned to sluggishness. At the closing, there was only a 0.01 to 0.02 increase compared to the previous day. Until the afternoon opening, this month was still not good at first, but some of the goods that the dealers intended to deliver were collected and hedged into forward months, resulting in reduced chips, and because the end of the day had been reached, short positions were rushed to cover, so the market atmosphere rose step by step. Transactions in the forward months were not smooth, but people's minds were also cheerful. After observation, the downtrend may have come to a temporary halt. As a result, this month rose 0.07 compared to the previous day, September rose 0.04, October rose 0.03, November rose 0.02, and December and January were not open. The spot wheat market was clearly smooth, with specially high-quality goods not open. Tung wheat was 3.65 yuan, Tong wheat was 3.645 yuan, and Di post wheat was 3.64 yuan, down to 3.65, 3.66 yuan, with a total of 9,500 bags sold.</p>
<p>Melons Are Ripe, Rice Has Entered the Market</p>
<h3>|Thin Rice Is Dazed and Drops by 0.2|</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources, with both retail and wholesale showing languidness and a bleak situation. The market showed fatigue, and the price of thick-stemmed and Du Yangjian from the Changgang, Su Tonggang, and Nangang gangs depreciated by 0.15 yuan. As for the Qingjiao, Sisong, and Fenglian thin rice, the Beiyang gang only had more than 1,000 bags going out, and the previous market was in a stalemate and showed fatigue, so yesterday the market showed weakness when it encountered a setback, causing prices to be cut by 0.2 yuan, and the price changed Yuan was flat. The new outlet for Dongfang Factory was still smooth, and the market price rebounded by 0.2 yuan. In Nanshan, such as Xiaotang and other places, which are famous for melons ripening and rice being sold, Geng Fang has now entered the market, and the goods are still good. They are sold by the Xinchang Factory, and the price is 7 yuan.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources for each gang under the sun were twenty-seven or eight, the market for each type of goods was weak, and the white glutinous rice still showed a tired trend. The price of early thin rice and Yangbu tip and New Customer tip was flat, and the price of the Dongxin glutinous rice was rare, and the price was raised by 0.2. The price of Lingbai tip changed, Yuan showed a tired trend.</p>
<h3>New Hunan Xian Continues to Arrive, Down 0.1</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Xiang glutinous rice market, customer gangs ran to a very greedy stomach, the market could have been stable, but Hunan new glutinous rice had a great early harvest this year, and the market jumped by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan the day before yesterday, which had aroused trial operations by dealers, and a batch of road goods arrived in the city yesterday. Various roads in Nanjing, Jiangbei and Anhui province also arrived by wheel, so the cargo owners were very eager to leave as soon as possible, and were unwilling to hold on again to repeat the mistakes of wheat, so the selling price of new Xiang province was immediately reduced by 0.1 yuan. It is estimated that 200 bags arrived at the machine Jing and 628 bags at Jing, and all of them were opened. The price of machine new Jing was 6.75 yuan, and the price of brown new rice was 5.4 yuan, all of which were managed by the Quanzhou gang of Fujian Province. The market is still active, and the rise and fall of the market depends on how much cargo arrives and how the customer gangs dispose of it.</p>
<h3>New Hankou Mung Beans See a Decline of 0.2</h3>
<p>The new mung beans were once active, but the market turned tired yesterday, because the source was being connected, but the outlet could not be expanded, so the new Ming mixed wool mung beans in Hankou took the lead in falling by 0.2 yuan, and the kiln goods followed suit, with only the Xiamen gang managing the stomach outlet. It is estimated that 271 bags of Hankou goods were sold, priced at 4.6 yuan, and 108 bags of kiln goods, priced at 4.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea: Autumn Silkworms in Jiangsu Are Developing Well</h3>
<p>Liyang Autumn Silkworms Are Thriving in Liyang: The number of silkworms raised in Liyang cities and villages this autumn has doubled, with a total of 17,800 sheets of autumn seed raised in the county. The silkworms are developing smoothly and are now in the stage of abundant leaf growth after the third sleep. The price of mulberry leaves is high, and each load has risen to more than 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Customer Sales Have Difficulty Progressing: Yesterday, the sales of artificial silk in this port were still difficult to progress. Only the Meiya and other silk factories in this port received 26 boxes of Flying Elephant, Kelly, Matte, and Blue Ning brands of spot and futures goods, priced at 184.5 to 156.75 yuan net.</p>
<p>European and American Silk Sales Are Lonely and Spiritless: Yesterday, only 40 bales of Shanghai White Factory silk were received by Lianna and others, which were still for short covering purposes, and the price was neither honorable nor disgraceful.</p>
<h3>Tranquility in the Tea Market of Foreign Firms</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various European firms, citing recent purchases and urgent telegrams from abroad, were busy packing and reporting for export. Therefore, they mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the new samples displayed by various tea warehouses. Yesterday, the market only saw Yongxing, China Tea, Tianxiang, and other firms showing slight interest in extracted Zhenmei tea. The rest of the market remained stagnant. However, according to general tea merchants, there is hope for activity in Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea next week.</p>
<h3>Increasing Sales of Serge-de-Nîmes Trouser Fabric</h3>
<p>Sales of serge-de-Nîmes to garment makers are quite good. Kong Shide's 1005 old brand is wholesaling at eight yuan per yard, while Hao Hua's No. 2 is at six yuan and six jiao. There have been no transactions on this street yet, but since yesterday, there has been a gradual sign of activity. Western clothing shops in the Daxin Street area of Zhejiang Road are reportedly asking for prices. It is said that on the same day, more than ten pieces of Deji and Kong Shide serge-de-Nîmes were sold, with most buyers paying a deposit in advance and issuing tickets for the yardage, to be delivered when the weather cools down slightly.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Over Three Thousand Boxes of British Steel</h3>
<p>In the past two days, Gonghexiang, New Taikoo, and other warehouses have received 3,400 boxes of 200-pound British steel in stock. With more goods in the market, it is increasingly difficult to be optimistic about market prices. Currently, good quality steel is opening at 32 yuan, second-quality at 31 yuan, and No. 3 steel at 29 yuan and five jiao. It is reported that only local manufacturers have a small amount of buying and selling activity.</p>

<h3>The Future of the US National Recovery Movement</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xiao Chengyi</p>
<p>The economic panic of 1933 swept through the imperialist countries and their colonies. Even America, the so-called "Gold Dollar Empire," was caught in the whirlpool. In February of this year, just days after President Roosevelt took office, a very serious banking holiday financial crisis erupted, not only affecting all 48 states of the United States, but also impacting the entire world. Countless US industrial and commercial enterprises were affected, causing cash flow problems and leading to shutdowns and bankruptcies, which in turn exacerbated the severity of unemployment and panic, making it impossible to resolve. At the same time, the agricultural panic caused by the fall in agricultural prices further interacted with the financial panic, making it even more profound.</p>
<p>After the financial crisis broke out, President Roosevelt took emergency measures, promulgating various mandatory decrees to temporarily curb the powerful financial storm with extraordinary means. He then implemented the so-called "National Recovery Movement" to restore the prosperity of the golden age of capitalism in 1927. But can this really succeed? Let us first see how he is doing this "recovery movement," and then discuss its success or failure.</p>
<p>The main aspect of the "Recovery Movement" is to carry out large-scale construction projects in order to reduce and curb the increase in unemployment. The plan includes finding new mines to dig and afforest, as well as immediately starting to manufacture dozens of warships with the massive tonnage permitted by the "Naval Treaty" to stimulate production industries. It is said that the implementation of this "Recovery Movement" can provide employment for 500,000 workers. However, this alone reveals the emptiness of the so-called "National Recovery Movement." The United States now has 12 million unemployed workers, and the result of this "Recovery Movement" of large-scale construction is only to provide employment for 500,000 workers. Isn't this just a drop in the bucket? Although the effect is not equal to zero, it can be generally seen. In particular, a large part of the large-scale construction projects belong to shipbuilding, from which it can be further known that the fundamental purpose of the so-called "Recovery Movement" is not "recovery" at all. Rather, it is based on Japan's urgent attack on China, and the balance of the open-door policy in China cannot be maintained and is being monopolized by Japan. At the same time, due to the increasing urgency of the international situation, and the possibility of a world war for the re-division of colonies in the declining period of capitalism breaking out at any moment, they have had to vigorously expand their military equipment and throw a so-called "National Recovery Movement" smoke screen to cover up.</p>
<p>Now, even if we take a step back and admit that the purpose of the "National Recovery Movement" is for "recovery," what is the progress of the movement? The Reuters dispatch in the Shenbao of the 17th of this month carries the following: "The National Recovery Movement has now entered the second stage, and the government is encountering even greater difficulties. For example, the oil, iron, steel, and coal industries are constantly arguing about working hours and wage regulations, ┆┆ President Roosevelt is now actively trying to mediate the stalemate through the Supreme Recovery Administration Committee ┆┆ The Administration Committee is discussing various methods, one of which is to order male and female students who have recently graduated from school to return to school to alleviate the serious situation of unemployment. ┆" But regarding the dispute over working hours and wage regulations, is it safeguarding the interests of the capitalists?</p>
<p>Or is it favoring the workers? Due to the devaluation of currency and the rise in prices, the real wages of workers have decreased a lot, and life has become extremely difficult. Recently, 60,000 male and female garment workers in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have declared a general strike to demand increased wages and improved treatment, and there is a tendency to involve other industries. Resolving this dispute over wages and working hours is undoubtedly extremely difficult. In particular, the Administration Committee's plan to order students who have recently graduated from school to re-enter school in order to alleviate the serious situation of unemployment further shows that the "Recovery Movement" has no ability to provide effective and active relief for the unemployment problem. In short, the American economic panic caused by the inherent shortcomings of capitalism itself cannot be solved by President Roosevelt's "National Recovery Movement." For the same reason, the world economic recession, production decline, unemployment panic, trade decline, and the increase in all panic figures, due to the increase in tariff barriers in various countries, and the fierce struggle of currency and exchange rate policies caused by the fall in gold prices, making the situation increasingly worse, cannot be solved by the World Economic Conference. Therefore, the adjournment of the World Economic Conference without any results is not surprising.</p>
<p>An Extra in a Motion Picture Company</p>
<h3>The Dead Man in the Coffin</h3>
<p>— Yao Shiquan</p>
<p>People who work as extras in motion picture companies shoot films day and night. Sometimes, when you receive a notice to shoot a film at nine o'clock in the morning, you have to be at the company at eight o'clock. It is very common to shoot from nine o'clock until nine o'clock the next morning. Being confined in this unventilated lead house all day long is okay in cold weather, but it is unbearable in hot weather. Under the thirty-odd high-intensity electric lights, each lamp has a heat of at least like an electric stove. The sweltering heat of June is the period when we extras work desperately. It is like a dead man being confined in a coffin, unable to feel a single breeze or breathe in any air. Sometimes, the director does not care about your life or death. In hot weather, he wants to shoot a scene set in cold weather, so you have to put on a leather coat and wear a leather hat. Although you are sweating profusely, feeling dizzy, and extremely hot, in order to look real, the large stove in the set has to be turned on. The director orders you to say, "The plot is like this, you have to pretend to be very afraid of the cold and walk towards the stove to warm yourself." Then, you must naturally walk forward and re-bake your already stifled body. If you don't do this, how can you get the two yuan payment? Your heart is burning with fever,</p>
<h3>Echoes of Self-Employment Introductions</h3>
<p>Bingjun: We intend to invite you to serve as a social science teacher. We hope you will come to discuss the matter immediately. (Pang Zihang, Mingqiang Middle School, Maixing Road)</p>
<p>Ms. Qing: Please contact the following places: 1. Liu Wozhong, Post Office Box 159, this port, 2. Pang Zihang, Mingqiang Middle School, Shixing Road, and 3. Cao Yinyun, Sales Department, Bunnemann Company, 41 Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>Ms. Shi: Please contact Mr. Zhao at No. 65 Yuanfuli, Baoding Road, Tangshan Road, in person.</p>
<p>Mmes. Jing and Shi: Please indicate your mailing address. (Ju, 111 Meibai Road)</p>
<p>On the outside, you still have to pretend to be shivering from the cold. The female stars have people fanning them, and the director has ice cream and Dutch water, but what do we bit players have? Nothing but blood and sweat! Even if you are burning up with heat, like a steamed bun coming out of the steamer, the female star will still joke and say, "You look like a red-hot fat pig's head." At that time, you must smile ┆ smile ┆ and smile! And you had better answer wittily and say, "I look like a frozen lion's head." Then,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>They will laugh. This is not humiliation, it is supreme glory, because you bit players are not worthy of their delicate smiles!</p>
<p>The director's murderous decree continues to be issued: "Prepare the camera! Quick! ┆┆ Dead man! ┆┆ Pig! Hurry up and get closer, add coal to the fire, pretend to be afraid of the cold and shivering." At this time, our Lord God the director! He is truly like an all-powerful official, binding us insignificant commoners on the rack of torture, and we can only resign ourselves to fate. After a shot is finished, "Cut! Turn off the lights. Miss XX is hot, isn't she? Someone, fan her! ┆┆ Dutch water!" In the day and night by the blood-sucking machine, this sound is the most pleasant and the one we hear most often.</p>
<p>When the filming is over, it is dawn, and then you receive your wages. The two yuan payment is deducted by the agency for six jiao, and then four jiao for meals, leaving only one yuan in hand. This amount is not small, I think it is a lot. If you can shoot for eight or nine days a month, you won't starve to death even if you are hungry! For a day and a night, you risk your life, are scolded like a pig and a dog, have a sore back and legs, and are dizzy. Only then can you go home to rest and sleep. The journey home of more than ten miles can only be made on my two bicycles that don't cost money, and I run back quickly.</p>
<h3>"Revolutionary Writer Gorky"</h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhuang Keneng</p>
<p>丨Published by Shenghai Bookstore, priced at one yuan and two jiao丨</p>
<p>I spent three evenings reading "Revolutionary Writer Gorky." Undoubtedly, this book tells the story of Gorky's life and is a biography of him. However, I believe that it should not be regarded as an ordinary biography and read lightly. It should be seen as a good model for young people to emulate and a cornerstone for inspiration. Because although he was born in such a dark, damp, and muddy society at that time, he was still able to use his wise eyes to see the cruelty, shamelessness, stupidity of people, and the strangeness of various behaviors at that time. Even in his childhood, he witnessed everything and was able to stir his heartstrings, arousing his injustice and anger. He did not consider his humble origins as vulgar and shameful, but instead hardened his will because of the hardships he had personally experienced. He never succumbed to external temptations or yielded to violence. He always resisted violence and sympathized with the weak. He started his first job at the age of ten because his eccentric superior (cook) insisted that he read books to him, which aroused his interest in reading. After that, he seemed to be addicted and refused to be separated from books. Finally, he read extensively and became a homeless person wandering along the Volga River! He once drifted to work as a worker on the docks, a porter, and an apprentice cook on a ship! One day, he climbed to the highest peak of the Russian literary world and became a revolutionary writer who is famous all over the world today. This is not accidental. He has a history of struggle, an uncompromising spirit, a firm will, a keen eye, a cry for the welfare of the masses at the cost of self-sacrifice, and he does not collude with the treacherous and insidious people around him. What a great and admirable personality! No wonder Mr. Lu Xun said, "This book is really a good gift for Chinese youth." Therefore, I hope that every young person can accept this solemn gift.</p>
<p>Timely Article</p>
<h3>July 7th</h3>
<p>— Chen Tiaoyue</p>
<p>The slender crescent moon hung on the willow branch by the ditch. The early autumn night wind carried the mournful cries of autumn insects "jiji". Several dogs lying on the threshing floor preparing to spend the night, impatiently shook their heads at the moonlight a couple of times, and then lay still.</p>
<p>Ah, the early autumn night is desolate, but tonight there is a performance at the Dongyue Temple 丨 "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" 丨 Tonight is July 7th.</p>
<p>Looking in through the paper window of that thatched hut, under the dim candlelight, Meixiang had already brewed her mother's medicine. She frowned and tasted it herself to check the temperature, and then held it in both hands to her mother's bedside.</p>
<p>"Mom!" Her mother's eyes were tightly closed, her cheeks were flushed, and her pale forehead was covered with cold sweat. Usually, when she was sick and unable to get out of bed, she would constantly moan, moaning in pain, moaning in distress. This time, she did not moan, she was always so quiet, like the desolate early autumn night.</p>
<p>But tonight there is a performance at the Dongyue Temple 丨 "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl"! Tonight is July 7th.</p>
<p>Meixiang put her mouth to her mother's ear:</p>
<p>"Mom, the medicine is brewed. The doctor said that this prescription will have some effect. Mom, why are you always silent? The doctor said: you are too worried. Mom, my brother shouldn't be in too much danger."</p>
<p>Alas! Alas! Alas! That child Shengfu ┆ I told him early on ┆ not to go with that group ┆ to make trouble, and now he has been arrested for more than ten days, with no news at all. I am afraid he is mostly killed. Alas! Alas! Alas! My life will not be long either, worrying about you, this young girl, young ┆" Old people cannot afford to get sick. Once they get sick, they cannot even speak clearly.</p>
<p>"Mom, don't worry. Brother won't be killed. The officials also understand the suffering of the poor, and it is not a crime for workers to reasonably demand a wage increase from the boss! Mom, the medicine is getting cold, drink it."</p>
<p>Meixiang's mother, who was suffering from third-stage pulmonary tuberculosis, stretched her thin neck and just drank the medicine when she "poo" spit it out again.</p>
<p>"Tap, tap, tap," the sound of knocking on the door.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" Meixiang asked towards the door while wiping the medicine stains on her mother's chin.</p>
<p>"It's me!"</p>
<p>"I'm holding my mom!"</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to the Dongyue Temple? I came to find you specifically."</p>
<p>Glancing at her mother's face on her wrist, "I'm not going, my mom is very sick, you go alone. Don't forget to bring some lotus root to my mom."</p>
<p>"┆┆Little vixen┆┆Making people run for nothing┆┆"</p>
<p>"Do you hate me? ┆"</p>
<p>"┊┊" The voice outside disappeared.</p>
<p>The heart of a lung patient is often clear.</p>
<p>"Who told you to go to the Dongyue Temple?"</p>
<p>"Wang San's daughter from the previous village went!"</p>
<p>The hearts of young girls are the same, like a lotus flower just emerging from the water, swaying in the early autumn night wind, but Meixiang's heart is desolate.</p>
<p>"Will my brother really not be killed? Is it a crime to jointly demand a wage increase from the boss? Will the officials really understand the suffering of the poor? Old and sick mother, ┆┆ young self ┆┆?" Thinking, thinking, the fire of hope was blown away by the early autumn night wind. Thousands of sharpened arrows pierced through the heart one by one, and then pierced through the back one by one. The liquid from the heart turned into tears, sour and bitter, one by one, row by row. The candle on the table was also shedding tears.</p>
<p>An elderly person seriously ill is like a dying candle facing this early autumn night wind, and will be extinguished in a moment. The slender crescent moon outside the house, with its waist bent, moved lightly and quietly climbed to the roof ridge of the Earth God Temple. Ah, the early autumn night! It is desolate, desolate, but tonight there is a performance at the Dongyue Temple! 丨 "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" 丨 Tonight is July 7th.</p>

<h3>Goodbye, "Outdated" Amateur Weekly Editor!</h3>
<p>Editor: Please don't be shocked that a young man you've never met is writing you such a letter. If you are not "self-righteous," then please calmly read this letter!</p>
<p>I feel that the entire society is in a chaotic and dark period. The sharpening of class distinctions is causing the petty bourgeoisie to gradually decline. As a result, what is reflected in literature and art is only the groaning and dying cries of the petty bourgeoisie in the period of decline, either lamenting poverty or indulging in wine, sex, and women. I find it strange why the petty-bourgeois literati are just decadent all day long, willingly heading down the path of decline, and why there is no one with a rebellious mood to shout loudly!</p>
<p>Since you, sir, started editing the Amateur Weekly, it has indeed made me very excited. Although I don't know you personally, sir, I know that you must be a petty-bourgeoisie, but one who is unwilling to be暴 and is shouting loudly. I don't need to use nauseating words to compliment you, sir, but I think your publication is the most impressive supplement in the major newspapers. I admire your shouting spirit very much, sir, but I think your consciousness is not sufficient and not complete, which makes me deeply regret it. Maybe I have my own views, and you, sir, have your own views. "People have different aspirations, how can they be forced?" "Those who have different paths do not conspire with each other." But I believe that there is only one truth, and one plus one will never be equal to a number other than two!</p>
<p>In order to point out the error of your, sir, consciousness, I will first quote your, sir, words as follows:</p>
<p>丨June 11th "The Way Out for the Poor"!</p>
<p>"We hope that the gentlemen of the government should reflect on themselves and understand the difficulty of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's forty years of revolution,</p>
<p>and clearly understand the root cause of all unrest in society! The number of poor people is increasing. By referring to the Premier's will in this regard and working hard on relief efforts, there may be a glimmer of hope for the country's future. ┆┆"</p>
<p>丨July 2nd "The Nation's Future in the Mouths of Elementary School Teachers!"</p>
<p>"We teach and hope that the gentlemen of the government who are now actually responsible should ask themselves in the quiet of the night "┆┆┆"┆┆"</p>
<p>The above only extracts two paragraphs and is not taking things out of context. The original text is too long to record.</p>
<p>From the above two paragraphs, it seems that your, sir, method of saving the country is only a kind of "hope," a vague "hope," hoping that the gentlemen of the government will have a change of heart. I</p>

<h3>Six Sisters Group</h3>
<p>— Ms. Shan</p>
<p>We six are all sisters, with no uncles, no brothers, and no husbands. Our father was a famous painter, but he has now passed away. We are all university graduates. The total age is one hundred and forty-two years, with an average of about twenty-four years each. As for scholarship and talent, although we cannot compare with the French brother writers Alexandre Dumas and Alexandre Dumas Jr., we are all proficient in Chinese and Western painting, crafts, poetry, Chinese shorthand, and</p>
<p>Go, and can speak Shanghainese and Mandarin. We are all willing to serve as art teachers in middle schools, whether "hired separately" or "hired together" is acceptable. Mailing address: c/o this publication.</p>

<p>I think your, sir, earnest advice and loud shouts are truly admirable and pitiable, which makes me suddenly think of the loyal ministers and righteous servants in ancient history who directly advised the emperor and knelt and cried. If the emperor is gracious and accepts the loyal advice, then the country can be prosperous and the loyal ministers can be promoted and ennobled. But if there is a king who does not know good from bad, and is furious and kills the loyal ministers, and is even angrier and exterminates the nine clans, then things will be terrible!</p>
<p>You, sir, believe that the rise and fall of the nation depends on a single thought of the gentlemen of the government. Isn't this completely idealistic argument coming from your, sir, mouth a great joke to the world? We can naturally forgive your, sir, difficulties. In this era, it is truly said that trouble comes from the mouth, and criticizing in the stomach is a crime. We cannot speak freely, but can we just cover up our conscience and make insincere remarks!</p>
<p>In such a stormy era, in such an era of widespread poverty and hardship, we still use the word "hope" to comfort ourselves, deceive ourselves, and anesthetize ourselves. We truly feel that we are too pitiful, as pitiful as a lamb hoping for the master's forgiveness.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that you, sir, before the gentlemen of the government reflect on themselves and examine their consciences in the quiet of the night, you yourself may also reflect on yourself and examine your conscience in the quiet of the night. Think carefully about whether the young man's words are right or wrong!</p>

<h3>The Unbearable Favor</h3>
<p>— Ms. Fang</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>I wake up very late every day. This isn't due to inherent laziness, but because my utterly exhausted body needs a moment of rest. I feel like even this rest is so short, so I usually don’t crawl out of bed until after nine o'clock.</p>
<p>As soon as I roll out of bed, as always, my white-haired, pitiful mother immediately stumbles over with a basin of water for me to wash my face. Then, she presents a cup of hot water and two cold buns on a three-legged table. After washing my face, applying a layer of powder, tidying up my clothes, I wolf down the buns in a few bites, drink a cup of hot water, and rush out the door, sprinting to our restaurant. We must be at the restaurant before half-past nine to do our work. If we're even a minute late, the restaurant owner will fly into a rage and scold us mercilessly. And if business is a little slow that day, we're even more unlucky. The owner's threats are definitely not just a momentary outburst. He says, "Useless! Even ghosts are afraid to look at you, who else would want you to serve them? Today's sales will be deducted from your pay, and tomorrow you'll be dismissed." Alas, we dare not say a word back. If we provoke his temper, our jobs will truly be lost. We can only swallow our tears and, returning late at night, cry under the covers.</p>
<p>Upon entering the restaurant, we must first check our assigned areas—tables, chairs, tablecloths, oil and vinegar bottles—to see if they are dirty. If so, we must wipe them clean again with fresh water. We must prepare everything that is missing, one by one. Although the busboys have swept the floor once, we must inspect it again. After taking care of these chores, we must go to the kitchen to check all the ingredients for the day. We must carefully note which dishes were not available yesterday and which new dishes have been added, so we can properly serve our esteemed guests. By this time, it's probably almost eleven o'clock, and we finally have time to wait for the honored guests to arrive.</p>
<p>The busiest time is usually from three o'clock in the afternoon, with the most bustling being around nine o'clock in the evening. At the small, three-foot-wide kitchen door, a dozen female colleagues rush back and forth, carrying trays. If you're not experienced, you'll easily bump into someone and drop a tray of dishes. When the honored guests are toasting and eating, needless to say, we must accompany them, attending to them diligently and enthusiastically. In order to receive their generous tips, we must not only be clever with our words and pleasant in our appearance, but also endure all their insulting words and actions. No, they even call it affectionate favor! Heavens, are waitresses really just a type of prostitute? If it weren't for my aged and feeble parents and my three young siblings, if it weren't for the livelihood of my family, why would I be a waitress and subject myself to the favor of others? Too much favor is something a poor person cannot bear. To put it another way, if the monthly salary the restaurant owner paid could support these five lives without starving, why would I risk being treated like a toy by these honored guests, just to get a few tips?</p>
<p>The entire day's work leaves my body exhausted. I wish I could just use this floor as a mattress. Finally, the clock strikes one in the morning. The esteemed guests gradually depart, leaving their seats empty. We wait for the owner to calculate the day's earnings, watching his expressions of joy and anger. We sisters divide the tips bestowed upon us by the guests. Finally, we hear the owner's usual shout, "Come earlier tomorrow!" and we part ways, each heading home.</p>
<p>"Mom! Open the door!"</p>
<p>She's still awake, waiting for me.</p>
<p>"Xiao Ying, you're back! It's already past two o'clock."</p>
<h3>The Art of "Having Fun"</h3>
<p>— Zhen Yuan</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>The life of a waitress in Peiping is very hard. Although their income varies greatly, most can only barely make ends meet. Their wages are very low, at most three or four yuan per month, relying entirely on tips. However, they argue fiercely over even a few cents difference in wages, because the amount of wages determines their rank. Those with higher ranks can get more tips. In addition to the tips they are rightfully entitled to, they can also sometimes get special tips. Special tips are extra tips given secretly by the customers to one person alone. Needless to say, this is only the privilege of those waitresses with special abilities. There are also those who are very good at attracting customers and have special contracts with the owner, such as getting a certain percentage of all tips themselves. For example, in one restaurant in Peiping, there are more than twenty male and female employees, among whom one waitress gets four-tenths of the tips alone, leaving the remaining six-tenths to be divided among everyone else.</p>
<p>Speaking of how they treat customers, they treat those who are mainly there to eat the same way as the male waiters. But those who are mainly there to "have fun" require a lot of dealing with. A customer who is mainly there to "have fun" doesn't immediately order food upon entering. They always start with a pot of tea, slowly sipping it, and constantly calling the waitress into the room. Sometimes they ask for a napkin, sometimes they say the tea is cold, saying this and that, asking all sorts of questions. Only after several tens of minutes will they finally order dishes. When it comes time to order, they pretend to order while talking nonsense, sometimes taking ten or twenty minutes to order just two or three dishes. If she gets impatient or walks away because other customers are calling, he will immediately clang his bowl and chopsticks, forcing her to come back. The dishes he orders are always a few that go well with wine. When the dishes arrive, he slowly drinks his wine, just like when he was drinking tea, constantly calling people and asking for this and that, all to make the waitress stay in the room longer so he can "have fun." After the wine, he orders a few rice dishes. He eats the rice slowly. After the rice, he orders another pot of tea and continues to drink it slowly. It often takes three or four hours to eat a meal. When waitresses encounter this type of customer, they not only can't get angry, but they must also treat them especially well, because first of all, it's their duty, and second of all, offending a valued customer is a big deal. However, there are also those who especially welcome this type of customer, because that's where the special tips come from.</p>
<h3>Eating Waitresses</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhongyan</p>
<p>Part Three</p>
<p>In Peiping, the only businesses that hire waitresses are restaurants. The owners cleverly combine the four elements of drinking, eating, men, and women, truly seizing upon a wonderful theme. It even has a hint of humorous philosophy.</p>
<p>In reality, the number of stores in Peiping that hire waitresses is quite limited, mostly just new small restaurants and cafes. The old restaurants, aside from those that closed after the government moved south like Rui Ji Guang He Ju, etc., the currently open ones like Dong Xin Lou, Fu Quan Guan, Quan Ju De, Zhong Xin Tang, Yu Hua Tai, Bian Yi Fang, etc., seem to have not been affected by this so-called trend and continue to operate as they always have. Judging from the situation, their business may even be better than those restaurants that hire waitresses. Therefore, waitresses in Peiping are completely utilized by the owners as a kind of "living signboard" for advertising. At the entrance of stores that hire waitresses, you can easily find two equally sized red paper signs. If one side says "Fresh Stewed Mutton," then the other side, without a doubt, is "Young Waitresses."</p>
<p>Where to even begin with this...?</p>
<p>A certain authority in Peiping once issued a notice only allowing waitresses to wear plain blue cloth gowns, which is just ridiculous. But that's all they can prohibit. They certainly can't further restrict their shoes, socks, and makeup, so some of the waitresses inevitably have to spread the color on their faces.</p>
<p>What's especially outrageous is that a group of utterly bored literati (?) openly wrote novels like this in the newspaper: "Hey! Old Li, want to go eat waitresses?"</p>
<p>"Sure..."</p>
<p>Can waitresses be eaten? How strange! Therefore, many nursery rhymes have appeared in the Peiping market: "Waitresses, they're really not bad (not bad meaning not rotten). Cost three mao, give one yuan. Just don't want the old ladies!"</p>
