<p>東北義勇軍活動之消息。近日又繼續由各通訊社傳達·與國人耳目相接觸矣。其活動之地域。大抵在安東開原等日軍不予防備之區。及東寗汪淸等邊僻縣分。其各部活動人數。多不不過二三千。少則五六百而已。雖然目前情况之下。尙有一部分人。在淪陷將及二週年之東北各地。對日僞艱苦反抗。實將來恢復失土之一綫希望也。幽居者聞空谷之足音而喜。國人對此其亦可以稍獲慰藉矣乎。</p>
<p>回憶去年靑紗帳起後。東北愛國民衆。紛紛結合興起。義勇軍之勢力。曾盛</p>
<p>極一時。八月間之總攻擊活動範圍。縱則北起長春。南至牛莊營口。橫則及於遼東西參加人數。達十萬以上。海城大石橋之激戰。滿鐵附屬地之攻襲。日人爲之震駭失措。其數攻日軍司令所駐之瀋陽。尤足表現冒險奮勇之精神。終以所集非精練之兵所用非新利之器。既無後援。又缺接濟苦鬭兩月。受重大之損傷。及十月間。靑紗帳落。失所憑藉。遂以敗餒。及今再起。已是零星小部。而日人經營東北。又越一年。奮起活動。大非易易。吾人對於義勇軍。追記去年之盛况。觀察目前之情形。不能不有所感慨。然此爲環境所限。非東北民衆愛國心之衰退。亦非其鬭志之銷減也。</p>
<p>最近日軍部發表消息。述彼等心目中之匪賊。已由去年最猖獗時之二十九萬。減爲五萬四千人。並謂東北各鐵路。去年八月間被損毀一百七十次。今年八月。末遭若何損毀。吾人推想。日本宣傳員發表此種數字時。必有欣然之色。見於其面但不知吾中國人聞之。作何感想乎。東北民衆之愛國活動。時隔一年盛衰難易。即已如此。倘使日人更得從容布置。恐欲求義勇軍之能零星活動如今日。亦將不可得矣。</p>
<p>中國如未甘心放棄東北。尙欲收復此三百八十餘萬方里之失土。則保持東北民衆之抗日活動而不使絕跡。實爲必要。欲使東北民衆繼續抗日。奮鬭不屈。則關内人民。尤不可不盡接濟遙助之責。此所望於救國捐疑案之及早解决。俾辦理捐欵各機關。得恢復社會信用。繼續盡其職責也。</p>

<h3>僞組織之組織内容</h3>
<p>大連特訊、傀儡國自一九三二年三月九日宣告成立迄今、（一九三三年八月）僅十七個月有奇、一切政治工作、在此極短促之時間、經日人竭力經營、無一不收歸日人之手、而尙號於人曰、並無兼併野心、其將誰欺、茲特將其内幕情形、調查揭表如左、亦可見日人手段之陰很矣、</p>
<h3>㈠政治情形</h3>
<p>㈠縱的觀察　各縣縣長皆爲滿洲人、縣長之下設參事官、參事官皆爲日本人、各種政事例須經過參事官及縣長之手、形式上是縣長主持一切、參事官輔佐之、而叩其實際、則大謬不然、參事官爲後台老板、縣中治安·實業·財政·人事·等等大問題、咸由參事官主持之、縣長不過承參事官之命令、代爲宣傳執行而已、參事官爲實質縣長、縣長則僅具形式而已</p>
<p>各縣之實情如此、推而至省、省亦如此、省公署之下分總務聽·稅務監督署·（卽前之財政廳）民政廳　敎育廳·實業廳·警務廳·廳有廳長、輔助省長處理一省之政務、叩其實際、全省重要之政務、多萃聚於總務廳、全省治安之重要、（有槍階級）則隸屬於警務廳、而總務廳及警務廳之廳長、則皆爲日本人、因而省長一席、形同虚設、一切實際的設施、人事之進退、金錢之支配等等、則操諸總務警務廳長日人之手、</p>
<p>各廳廳長以下、設總務等四科或五科、科長人選</p>
<p>則滿人日人各半、而總務科長則必爲日本人無疑、質言之、總務科長卽實質的廳長、而廳長不過是總務科長之傀儡而已、各省政府之組織咸如上述、中央政府則分爲三院、（卽立法院·監察院·國務院是·）立法院正在考查日本憲時期、尙無何等具體成績的表現、監察院惟日本人的意旨是從、有時執行監察權、如黑龍江韓省長之被監察院彈劾、卽監察院執行職務之表現、不過動機在日本人、而不在滿洲人而已、國務院爲全國最高行政機關、内分設總務長官室與秘書官室兩部分、（總務長官爲日本人駒非德三、曾傳說其親批國務總理鄭孝胥之頰、）其下分爲外交部·民政部·財政部·軍政部·司法部·交通部·</p>
<p>實業部。文敎部·部之下分苦干司、各司司長日滿人各半、而總務司長率爲日本人、各部事務實權皆操於總務司、其他各司、不過照例奉行而已、因之各部總長·次長率皆徒擁虚名、</p>
<p>總之僞組織之政治、自縱的方面觀察、下自各縣、中經各省上而迄於最高之國務院、一切實權、皆操於日本人之手、其所謂各部總長次長、各省省長、各廳廳長、各縣縣長等、率皆有驅殼而無靈魂、日本人之爲總務長官、總務司長、總務廳長、參事官等、說東卽東、說西卽西、全權在握、氣燄薰天　故自縱的方面觀察、僞組織之政治、可謂已完全操諸日本人之手、</p>
<p>㈡橫的觀察　傀儡國之成立、迄今十七個月、其</p>
<p>政治成績之橫的觀察、略誌如下、㈠外交方面、</p>
<p>實質上將從前懸而未决諸問題、如礦山權土地商租權等、均如日人所希望者解决、形式上則人形使節團、少女使節團等、玉帛往來、煞是熱鬧大同元年舊歷中秋節日、日本國首先承認僞國日滿恊定書上、規定僞國治安由友邦日本負責、日本國可以自由駐軍於僞國、僞國派鮑觀澄爲駐日本全權大使、（現改任丁士源）日本國特任本莊案爲駐僞國全權特使、（後改任武藤及菱刈）除全權特使職務外、並兼任關東軍司令官、關東廳長官之職權、較諸在朝鮮之伊藤博文尤過之也、㈡民政方面、各縣初設指導官、後改參事官、參事官中流品不齊、在各縣作威作福、行贿受贿、奴隸縣長、弁髦法令、草菅人命、等等作惡、筆難罄書、各省之總務廳長警務廳長、各廳之總務科長把持一切、任意妄爲、傀儡長官措施倒置等、亦指不勝屈、以上均由民政部委任、把持實際的行政、表面上尙稱爲滿洲三千萬民衆之樂園、其内幕有如此者、㈢財政方面、僞政府曾借日債兩千萬元、用於軍事及接濟春耕、實行鴉片公賣公種、開二十世紀之新紀元、而各地方無吃　住之黎民、幾佔全數十分之八九、財賦欠收之數、亦佔比較額十分之六七、因而各地學校、</p>
<p>關閉者十之七八、僅都市中學校開學、又不能維持原有級數學生、失學者既增多、人民失業者尤增多也、㈣軍政方面、趨於逐漸裁汰之途逕、軍隊數目、逐漸减少、（友邦軍隊逐漸增多、以實行其維持滿洲國治安之責任、）軍械數量亦逐漸减少、警察夜間槍彈、每晚僅發給五枚、翌晨卽行收回、將來或能達到通國無兵無槍之地步、若重要軍官之任命、更須徴求關東軍司令官之同意、軍政部本身無能爲力、㈤司法方面、大體仍如先前、（領事裁判權）惟各縣之恊和會（一種中和機關）有代理人民訴訟者、顚倒是非、混亂已極、司法機關反而蕭條冷凈、無人過問、㈥交通方面、滿洲國所有鐵路、委託日本南滿洲鐵道會社代爲經理、因而瀋海鐵路、官商合辦之商股、爲日本方面收買者甚多、吉會鐵路亦如期完成、以達到淸津港達長春之捷便、電報電信電話無線電等已由日方經營、雖向僞國人徴股、而認購者寥寥、事後又多兌與日本人、此後滿洲國電氣事業、全操諸日本人之手矣、實業方面、先前懸而未决之諸問題、如礦山商租等等現在均按照日方意旨、完全解决、此外對於引河道·開水田·朝鮮農民强租民田種稻等事、皆屬習見之事、更擬强制移民（由日本移滿洲）二十萬於鏡波湖及興凱湖附近、實現之期、當不在遠、新京及奉吉黑熱各省會中之各種官署、凡有講置建築宴會娱樂等等、皆由日籍官吏向日方商號備辦、滿洲人自營之工商業、則仰屋興嗟、門可羅雀、㈧文敎方面、都市之中僅有中學小學、除哈爾濱外無大學及專門學校、鄉村之中學校、開課者與事變前較、僅有事變前十之七八、敎育宗旨、亦變成絕對服從之勞作敎育、（其實卽奴隸敎育）窺厥意</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>旨、殆欲造就成祇知工作不計其他之愚氓而已、</p>
<h3>㈡鐵路事業</h3>
<p>僞組織政府於本年春季、受日本之逼令、將東北所有之各鐵路港灣水運、及一切附帶事業、委託日本經營之南滿鐵路代理經營、並於二月一日成立鐵路總局、管轄之鐵路計吉長·吉敦·吉海·四洮·洮昻·齊克·洮索·藩海·奉山·東北·江運如營口·安東·鴨綠江·松花江·葫蘆島·全包括在内、總局粗織分總務、經理·運輸·機務·工務·及警務等六處、總局長宇佐美寛爾、各處長亦全爲日本人、總局内無中國人、各鐵路局由總局派往日本人代表一人、負完全責任、各局長得秉承本路代表意旨行事、東北鐵路已完全由日人直接管理、</p>
<h3>㈢礦山問題</h3>
<p>查開採礦山章程、向例須中國人始有領礦權、外人則無此權利、今僞國新章行將公佈、日本人得隨便開採礦山、農礦廳由去年十一月移入省城交涉署院内、所有礦照一律停發、金屬更特别禁止、因須俟新章頒佈、與日人以特權、農礦廳長徐紹卿、乃名義上廳長、總務科長升巴爲農礦廳之太上廳長、礦務科長爲山根、此科爲日人把持、可得特别便宜、</p>
<h3>㈣郵局情形</h3>
<p>僞組織之郵局、現在收入、勉强開支、共有六百</p>
<p>六十人、日人佔要職者一百五十人、握最高權威者爲日本監察官、外交中村久坪、（原接收人）人事户倉勝人、（事管升遷裁汰人員）秘書處處長日本人大宇、内分四課、三課課長全爲日人、會計處處長爲田中堪吾、内分二課、計事務·會計均爲日人、巡員處長中村、兼職管本外城及各縣支局、總監察處長日本人吉村壽、（管理局内）文具處處長日人、營業處處長千皂昇、郵局内職員中日人同等工作、但中國人僅拿日人之半薪耳、</p>
<h3>㈤銀行情形</h3>
<p>查日本自佔據東北以來、首先没收省立各銀行把持經濟金融、現東北遼吉黑三省立銀行、合併爲一僞滿洲國立中央銀行、由中國人榮厚、（字淑章前吉林財政廳長）爲名義上總裁、其實一切金融重大問題、均由副總裁三成橋六·業務部長鷙尾一·興業部長五十嵐·三人獨握特權、僞滿洲中央銀行總行在長春、共有職員二百人、而日本人佔一百七十人、日本人不僅佔據要位、卽下役亦係日人、但薪水則甚優、日人護兵月薪一百二十元、茶役月薪八十元、而中國人在僞滿洲中央銀行成立後、被排失業者、已有五千人、（包括舊遼吉黑省立銀行、及附屬營業被排之人數）</p>
<h3>㈥電氣事業</h3>
<p>東北四省遼吉黑熱之電報電話無線電報無線電話無線電播音、及其他電氣事業、俱由日本人於三月廿六日、迫立滿洲滅日合辦通信公司協定、又設立一滿洲電信電話株式會社、把持强奪而去、其名爲社組織、資企定爲日本國幣五千萬元、又將東北四省（彼稱僞國範圍内）所有電氣通信事業、（卽東北四省有線氣線電報電話播音等）核價六百萬元、日本國幣作十二萬股、計每股金票五十元、而日本南滿洲附屬地内則核價一千六百五十萬元、作股三十三萬股、總計一百萬股、除上列之四十五萬股外、再由僞滿日兩國政府公共團體國民中募集、被壓迫之中國人、無人入股者、有自認爲滿洲國人者、入股亦寥寥、總之東北電氣事業、已被僞滿洲國拱手送日人矣、</p>
<h3>㈦社會黑暗</h3>
<p>東北社會滿佈陰慘黑暗恐怖窮苦惡劣腐化諸現象、各處鴉片館林立、賭塲遍設、（咸由日本人開設之）女招待及暗娼到處皆是、人民有因債務或土地起糾葛者、全由日本人包辦之法院處　、日本人遇事强制執行、比法院之合法判决尤有效力、稍有資產之人民、生命財產時有危險、因常有日本浪人訛詐不遂、卽誣爲反滿抗日、私通義勇軍街市間乞丐觸目皆是如有一人給乞丐以錢、則羣丐擁至、半日不得脫手、居民商舖受强搶者、無日無之而人民習尙嗜好、非吸鴉片卽是賭博、吃酒嫖妓猶在其次社會間種種惡現象　世罕見、此爲僞國王道樂土之表現也、</p>
<h3>㈧敎育怪狀</h3>
<p>僞國敎育部受日本人之命令、秋季不准招生、故　假小學中學畢業之數千名學生、以遼寗省城一處算）全無學堂可入、均已失學、敎員所敎之班若已畢業者、卽行失業、各校敎員被排擠而失業者、亦極多、春季開學時、各校之日本學監、令各校敎職員拭玻璃、擦地板、女師範之校長六十老叟、日本學監在彼天寒地凍時、尙令其脫去皮袍、揩擦地板、以敎育界智識份子、而受此奴隸待遇、亦可慘矣、今日瀋陽縣敎育局招考鄉村敎員五十名、（月薪二十餘元）應考者竟達六百多名、均有新制師範舊師範舊　中東北大學預科畢業者、東北敎育界今後失學失業者、必日見增多、因日本人對於智識份子、極力排斥故耳、</p>
<h3>㈨失業衆多</h3>
<p>東北農業因僞國成立後、日人令用關稅壁壘政策、農產物不能外運、以致農產價廉、農户所負之苛捐雜稅又遇重、小農中農先後破產、壯者爲匪、弱者餓斃、繼而富農亦不能支持、農村經濟破壞、農民大半無力耕田、率皆失業、商業因受關稅影響凡販賣西洋及中國貨物者、咸先後關閉、賣日本貨者、因日本已直接經營、亦閉歇失業、卽有不閉商店、亦因日趨枯竭、商人有業無薪、亦等於無業、工業因受日本工業之侵略、政治之壓迫、已無發展之可能、勞工因日本人來東北者過多、一元工資以上之勞工、全爲日本人所做、五角以上之勞工爲高麗人所做、最低賤者中國人纔能得到、中國人在東北之農商工學、求生之艱窘、爲世人所夢想不及者也、</p>
<h3>㈩鴉片公賣</h3>
<p>鴉片毒物、日人在東北利用爲唯一入欵之來源、弱種利品、凡僞國勢力所及之地、完全提倡、獎勵吸種運賣、以遼寗省城一隅而論、經僞國奉天省政府指令設立之鴉片零賣所、已有四十處、每處請領許可證時、交奉天省政府保證金五百元、連日本人之受贿運動費等起、一鴉片零賣所牌照得現洋五千元、每處每日平均能賣二百元之數、零吸之鴉片每份有二角或四角者、卽奉天省城一隅、在此公賣鴉片地方吸食鴉片者、當有兩萬多人、而私賣私吸者尙多、東北民族之將來、尙堪設想乎、不特此也、所有東北所產鴉片原料、必均經滿洲國所設之鴉片公賣處收買、運往大連、經日本改造鴉片機關加以改造後、始再轉賣與吸户、大概所參加之質料、能令吸鴉片者不易戒除、其陰狠毒辣、令人可怖、</p>
<h3>吉東大戰將發</h3>
<p>華東軍三路沿綏芬綫西進派員赴各國購買大批軍火</p>
<p>哈爾濱特訊、華東共和國、近爲救軍事上之進展、領域之擴充、對於所收編之義軍、積極充實軍事訓練與戰鬥技術、軍械準備、除前經蘇俄將中俄戰役繳去韓梁兩旅之槍械及馬占山·蘇炳文·李杜·王德林諸部、退俄境時被繳去之槍械、共三萬餘支發還外、現在又密秘派人前往其他各國、購買大批軍火、完成本年度五個師之計劃、日僞軍關於華東共和國此種準備、頗爲恐慌、日關東軍現正積極派軍防守、但以各地義軍蠭起、實有顧此失彼之患、並聞華東軍現已完成兩師、人數約在八萬、沿綏芬綫及大綏芬河一帶、分兵三路西進、現雖未與日僞軍接觸、但實力頗爲雄厚、最近於吉東一帶、將有大戰爆發</p>
<p>（東北社）</p>
<h3>平綏路局長否認平綏借欵</h3>
<p>平方又傳出賣龍烟煤礦說各方重視以亦待事實證明</p>
<p>北平特訊、連日外間盛傳平綏路大借欵之說、眞相如何、尙待異日事實證明、頃據平綏路局長沈昌、對記者談稱、外間所傳平綏路進行七百萬借欵一節、並非事實、年來平綏路破壞不堪、確有舉借鉅債、積極整理之必要、惟所傳云云、確無其事、前次平綏路中斷之時、因收入减少、無法支持、曾向平津銀行界商借四十萬、以應急需、嗣以大同煤業公司、託由本路運煤、添購車輛、又商借四十餘萬、共計八十餘萬元、此乃事實、或因此引起外間之誤傳、亦未可知、余已擬有平綏路之復興計畫、約需工料費二百餘萬、將來實施、儘可賒欠材料、無須向銀行界借欵、現屆淡月暫未實行、一俟收入略有把握、復興計畫及整理　債等項、即可次第着手進行云云</p>
<p>平方近又盛傳當局將出賣平綏線龍烟煤礦於日本之說、謂此事由中央某部長在平進行、某部長亦曾親至該礦查勘、交涉已大致就緒、各方以日軍深入以來、平綏線爲國防上之重地、不能輕易任令外人勢力伸入、對於此事、頗爲注意、查該礦煤鐵礦苗極富、成立公司已久、迄未開採、今若出賣於日本、非特以利　敵、且於國防上大有關係、停戰以來、日軍參謀密探、多赴南口靑龍橋一帶、窺探形勢、居心叵測、萬一將來平綏線上有何枝節、則非特察綏危險、而華北亦無屏障、關係綦巨云云、但是否有無其事、亦尙待事實之</p>

<h3>寒暑三易跋涉萬里</h3>
<p>當李夢生發起組織中國靑年亞細亞步行團時、各界報名加入者幾及百人、　甄别及格僅八人、男五人、女三人、皆係靑年學生、計爲李夢生、龍溪人、年廿七歲、陳晤、思明人、年廿六歲、芳越、蘇州人、年廿四歲潘德明、湖州人、年廿一歲、女團員胡素娟、龍溪人、年廿三歲、尙有男團員馮冰魂·女團員崔小瓊·崔秋舫·三人、當十九年六月廿八日由滬出發後、均因病體弱、相繼在松江·杭州·兩處中途折回、其餘團員五人、則乃繼續前進、該團旅行全程、共分三期、五年爲限、八月十七日由杭出發、歷寗波·温州·平陽而至福州、轉汕頭潮州·梅縣·廣州香港·瓊州法屬越南之邊防·東京·淸華·西貢·金邊馬德望·暹羅·亞蘭曼谷至馬來半島·再由吉打·雙漁·至檳榔等·吉隆坡·新嘉坡、此爲第期行程、由新嘉坡海道至蘇門答臘·爪哇·波羅洲·至緬甸經印度·阿富汗·波斯阿剌伯·至君上垣丁、此爲第二期行程再　君土垣丁出發過土耳其直赴歐洲各國、然後渡太平洋赴美由日本返國、此爲第三期行程、亦卽最後之終點、現潘德明君、已步行至日内瓦、完成第二期行程費時三載有餘一洗東亞病夫之恥辱、誠屬壯哉此行、</p>
<h3>孑然一身環游世界</h3>
<p>當該團五人行抵厦門時、陳晤黃越兩同志、又因病不能同行、及人安南海防東京、至淸化時、李夢生與胡素娟亦臥病旅次、至此、全國八人、僅剩潘德明一人、於是潘乃單身獨行、繼續前進、先至暹羅、卽變列行程、由西貢·金邊·馬德望·曼谷·吉打·而至檳榔嶼、旋至新嘉坡、由海道至蘇門答臘·爪哇·婆羅洲·經印度、過帕米爾高原·喜馬拉雅山·過土耳其、始於本年六月、步行抵日内瓦、孑然一身、遍歷各國、得以安然無恙、當</p>
<p>非倖致也</p>
<h3>餐風冒霜歷盡艱險</h3>
<p>據該旅客言、該靑年步行家滿面風塵、兩腕黎黑、然體魄甚壯、精神極佳、其行李甚少、僅隨身應用物品數件、當其行抵檳榔嶼時、因隻身旅行、頗感寂寞遂購脚踏車一輛以代步、自後步行乃變爲東行、每日可行一百九十餘哩、但經過印度土耳其兩地、曾先後遇土匪兩次、第一次未蒙刦掠、第二次則被土匪將脚踏車刦去、幸未傷害性命、而此後車行又變爲步行、三年餘來、長途跋踄、或攀高嶺、或越河海、無論風霜寒暑、頗受痛苦、沿途波折疊出、阻撓重重、危險情况、難惟言喻、當經印度大森林時、該地獅虎豹狼、常出吃人、潘君曾臥於一大樹上凡三書夜、但每到一地、輒受當地之熱烈歡迎、參觀機關團體、出席演講、至爲忙碌、各地政府對旅行家均有資助、潘君亦將沿途所攝照片隨時出售、以充旅費、並聞潘君已能譜解三十餘國文字語言、所得資料極豐富、潘君抵日内瓦後、卽又出發赴法國巴黎、游歷英·德·意各國再渡太平洋至美洲、由日本返國俾完成最終之行程、預計明年下旬、該靑年步行家當可完成全程、載譽回國、</p>
<h3>暗殺高蘭生案開審記</h3>
<p>捕房調查經過至爲詳盡尙須搜集證據改期再訊</p>
<p>向開花會兼製紅丸之高蘭生又名高阿根、近因犯案、已被法捕房連同其友孫泉海（綽號小鬍子）併拘押、惟高等於被捕之前、曾在福州路樂餘里弄口、突遭仇人開槍狙擊、事後經老閘捕房副探長謝水泉調查得兩人童田華（又名蹺脚阿三）·及南京人李金山（卽王金山）·對於該開槍事件大有關係、將童李拘解第一特區地方法院、諭令押候查明突辦在案、茲據捕房查明八月六</p>
<p>日上午三時、高等在樂餘里</p>
<h3>突遭開槍圖害</h3>
<p>實係童·李·與在逃之　黨所爲、遂以刑法二八四條殺人罪對　李起訴、昨晨解請第一特院、錢鴻業庭長開庭研訊、並由法捕房將高阿根孫泉海·兩人派探押送到庭、以資質證、先由代表捕房起訴之汝葆彝律師將被告等蓄意殺高之始末原因、詳細陳述、謂本市花會賭博、歷史悠久、最近十年、初由毛阿祥爲首領、繼則有趙阿五起而</p>
<h3>與毛平分秋色</h3>
<p>迨至民國十九年、高阿根亦突然崛起、本案第被告童田華、爲毛阿祥之愛徒、十九年二三月間童家於愛爾近路德壽里、其日淸晨、其家忽來暴徒四五、向童開槍、兇手中有名小八妹者、童知係高阿根之徒、乃訴諸其師毛阿祥、毛以高既欲置彼之門徒於死地、故亦派五人</p>
<h3>組織一殺高團</h3>
<p>本案第二被告李金山、爲五團員之一、該國以陳某爲渠魁、並由毛撥現金五百元、作團中經費、是時高阿根因滬上各法院羈拿風緊、逃往漢口、此五人團遂追踪赴漢、冀就彼處圖之、高亦消息靈通、預先得悉、　報漢口公安局、及此五團員抵漢臯當被拘捕四人轉解該地法院研訊結果蹺脚永林與徐光孝各被判處徒刑十二年、李金山及另團員、則宣告無罪、而被推爲渠魁之</p>
<h3>陳某僥倖兎脫</h3>
<p>從此毛·高·兩方之仇益深、乃事有凑巧、去年五月間、高阿根之　王振祥混名小鬼阿六者在法租界遭人暗殺、</p>
<p>高阿根卽揚言兇手係童田華、而法捕房遂　童逮捕偵查審訊、至本年月間、經法院宣判無童既被釋、適高又因法院缉拿、潛往外埠、</p>
<h3>殺機本可中止</h3>
<p>不料至七月廿八日、童因閘北家内之紅丸機關初公安局搜查、不敢歸、逃避在外忽聞高已返滬、且有仍不能忘情於彼之意、乃約同李金山往新世界飯店暫住、連續三天、共開一百廿·一百廿二·及一百廿七·等三個房間、並商議殺高討劃、從前五人團之首領陳某、亦皆參預、童本備有手槍、向藏家内、此番家被查搜、手槍已失、故陳其允供給手槍、至八月二日彼等</p>
<h3>遷居大東旅社</h3>
<p>二百廿九號房間、五日薄暮、童偶出外、行經浙江路、與名阿榮者</p>
<p>相値童知阿榮爲高阿根方面之人、但阿榮素性貪利、倘略給金錢、不難探悉阿根踪跡、卽與阿榮敷衍、果從阿榮口内獲知阿根定是夜在會樂里妓女圓圓家宴客、須午侂三時可散、童既探明、卽回大東、候至晚間十時、陳某到來、童以所得消息告之、陳某當出邀一同黨、各携一手槍、仍回大東、旋又往福建路大江南飯店、邀李金山及一徐某、時李等方聚賭、至十一時才到濟、除童因</p>
<h3>嘵脚不良於行</h3>
<p>劉守大東外、餘四人相將同去李在天蟾舞臺門前望風守候至次晨一時、高等自妓家出陳某見一人跨登汽車、認爲高阿根、卽向開槍其實此人用小鬍子、係高之友、旋巡捕聞聲趕到、若輩仍開槍拒捕、幸才傷人而李在大東候至大明五時、猶不見諸人返、料事未成、遂卽逃逸、此爲</p>
<h3>殺高經過事實</h3>
<p>今人證齊備、請求研訊云云、繼由高阿根陳述是夜遇險情形、謂</p>
<p>彼所見之開槍者係一胖子、李金山則在奔跑至童田華原爲素識等語錢庭長復將昔年在漢情形及王振祥被殺兩事、向高訊問一過、又由孫海泉證明因與高爲友、此番從外歸、高爲其洗塵、設宴後出妓院、方登汽車、突聞槍聞、驚而躍下致跌於地當卽鳴笛告警各情、庭上始將兩被、告隔别研鞫但訊及八月六日開槍之事、該被告　均支吾其語、其他諸事、一如在捕房所供、不加變更錢庭長以尙須調查諭被告還押、改期再訊</p>

<h3>日輪職員私帶洋酒發覺</h3>
<p>寗運白蘭地漏稅中途失竊起糾紛</p>
<p>本埠日淸公司之唐山丸輪、自大連經靑島來滬、船内發生私運洋酒被竊、毆打水手頭、而激起報告水巡隊逮捕輪船買辦等糾紛事件、茲將此事狀况、查報如下、</p>
<h3>大連洋貨廉價</h3>
<p>我國海關當局、自增加進口稅率以後、洋貨之輸入中國者、其奢侈品納稅最大、有値百徴百有値百徴一百六十者、如法國等處運來之洋酒、關稅乃大增、而市上之售價、因亦飛漲、大連爲自由港、洋貨運往、可免納稅、而各項舶來奢侈品、在在較上海爲廉、滬上一般人乃有從大連密購洋酒、亦托船員潛行偷帶至滬者、海關檢查雖嚴、而漏稅私進至滬者、亦常有之</p>
<p>事、</p>
<h3>白蘭地酒密運</h3>
<p>日輪唐山丸、上次從大連開來上海時、其船上某部分職員、在大連私購白蘭地酒兩打、每瓶售價、可較滬上賤五元數角、大利所在、人必爭之、當時該洋酒上船時、交船内水手頭目密藏在木匠間内、以避江海關之檢查、素來如是者、此回密帶之白蘭地兩打、亦藏在木工臥室中、約至上海後取出、</p>
<h3>被竊遷怒水手</h3>
<p>及唐山丸此回至滬、欲取此洋酒、水手頭目向木匠間内往提、而忽然失踪、蓋已被他人竊去矣、水手頭目據實報托帶之某職員、詎該職員强指是水手頭目所竊、乃報告虹口捕房、將水手頭目帶入捕房、照小竊對侍、用銬銬手、並經某職員將該水手頭目痛打一頓、後經偵查、方知爲另一水手所竊、並非水手頭目所取也、</p>
<h3>報告私運内幕</h3>
<p>此事發生後、水手頭目以無辜被捕、且遭毒打心實不甘、乃轉輾至水上公安隊、密報唐山丸輪某職員之專事私運洋酒、從大連潛裝至滬、偷漏關稅、已非一次、每一打白蘭地至少可餘四五十元、此次船上失竊之洋酒、即係渠私自偷運之貨、失去之後、反誣良爲竊、身遭侮辱云云、</p>
<h3>傳捕買辦狀况</h3>
<p>水上公安隊據該水手頭目告密對於此案决計追究、以私帶之某職員屬於唐山丸輪買辦所屬且私運洋酒偷稅入口、情節頗重遂由該隊派長警多人、至日淸公司傳捕買辦、並令交出私運洋酒之人、當因唐山丸輪已開、買辦不在滬上、致當時未經傳到、現此事尙未解决、</p>
<h3>探捕盜匪格鬭</h3>
<p>拘獲盜匪孫七流彈傷二女足</p>
<p>昨晚六時五十五分愉林路捕房、忽接警報、據稱韜朋路昆明路平川内、有盜匪匿跡、希圖行刦、該捕房當派大批探捕前往捕捉、先將某號把守、再行進内拘捕、詎各匪早已得訊、故待探捕入門、匪等皆從後門逃竄、當場僅拘獲殿後匪徒一名、供名孫七、同黨約有八九人云、探捕得悉後、即穿出該屋後門、追踪匪後兜捕、各匪見探捕步步進逼、情急慌張、乃竟拔槍開放、於是探捕亦還擊、雙方激戰片刻、匪衆不支、乘槍聲密如連珠之際、紛向四方逃逸、故未拘獲、探捕等乃將當場擒獲之匪、帶入捕房拘押訊辦、一面即行派探四出追緝在逸各匪、以當探捕與匪格鬭時、該處平房内江灣婦人沈許氏、年五十五歲、方與伊外孫女襲寳寳、年十三歲、在門外納凉、均被流彈擊中右足、旋經探捕發覺、將兩人車送同仁醫院醫治、</p>

<h3>倫敦特約通信一志寄七月六日（星期四）</h3>
<p>事前希望今日安靜無事、結果則非常動人而滿是驚險、天氣又轉熱、陽光猛射、亦無風息以减低炎熱、中央第一兩塲、經九日之比賽、復無滴雨、已現消損、但尙在繼續忍受、今日比賽集中於此兩主要場、觀客滿座、</p>
<p>美國尙堪自慰、剩餘女子選手之一、傑各白女士、爲郎德女士所敗、馬迪夫人則繼續勝利、擊敗克拉温格夫人、克共勝六局、有時局勢異常緊張、梵恩斯則在努力加工練習、</p>
<p>馬迪夫人幾成爲一神秘之球員、無人不存疑問、馬迪夫人豈不屑表演其眞實本領、抑其眞實本領、仍在保持之中、夫人始終神秘的住站後場、與此亭亭之德女子作長抽、在四比四時、馬迪發球、三十丨四十、此時克拉温格衡前上網、但惜未得之、馬迪以六比四勝此第一盤、泰然若無事、第二盤分成二部、一爲長抽對抗、各人皆集中球於對方之反手、一爲克拉温格之高球、及偶然之上網、同時馬迪夫人亦改變其擊法、以時近時遠之球、欲破對方防線、但結果未得成功、四比○、五比一、馬迪發球、再勝一分卽再勝一盤、但一次發球雙誤、二次觸帶、將此局奉送、克拉温格發球成五比三、再次一局、結束比賽、此並非因馬迪之表演進步、實則克拉温格之疲乏、不少錯誤、有以致之、雖敗猶有餘榮、馬迪夫人或有意如此、亦未可知、但其自信心、始終未曾動搖也、</p>
<p>傑各白女士與郎德女士在中央塲比賽、傑以四比一佔先、似將得此第一盤、但幾爲追及、結果以六比四得勝、第二盤傑又以三比一佔先、郎德在劇戰之後、失其發球局、次局傑之發球較佳二次皆一記得分、但漸見錯誤、幾乎將已得之優勢送失、此爲傑各白之全盛時代、郎德逐漸後追、愈追愈近、連勝二盤、第二盤六比四、第三盤六比二、</p>
<p>經長時間之劇戰、才得此結果、此局爲抽球與斬球之戰、傑各白幾常站於守衛線上、其抽球時遇不同方向之回擊、傑之發球較强、使對方觸網、空中壓球亦佳、尙欠堅實、因此常肇險禍比賽</p>
<p>殊爲奇突、風浪時起時息、滿座觀客吵擾不定、對於傑各白之掌聲、更意外之小、傑成一孤獨者、擁圍於成千成萬熱望英人得勝者之中、向球運奮鬥、更有甚者、幾次對於傑之線球判决、惡劣之至、一次在北端、在白線内之抽球、呌作出界、傑各白起作疑問、視線員乃改變之、但抗議者失去此分、其後數次、此同一之視線員、皆成錯誤、傑各白重要之一分、時被奪去、</p>
<p>在第二盤郎德以四比三勝對方之發球而佔先再繼之爲最長而單調之接戰、傑各白每局常達平勝等而失敗、郎德因對方之失誤成五比三、發球、六比四、於是各得一盤、</p>
<p>第三盤第五局爲關鍵、郎德一勝、成敗遂分、郎毫德不變動、使對方逐漸陷落、再以六比三淘汰之、</p>
<p>郎德爲應得勝利者、各方機會、常使其失望、但郎德堅持不亂、雖形勢更見惡劣、其發球雖弱、傑各白未能得勝之、其破對方之發球、使形勢轉傾、至於觀衆之存見、將來有產生一英國錦標手之希望、</p>
<p>其他比賽中、亦有驚人者、潘萊休斯以五盤敗於</p>
<p>佐藤布井之手、此塲爲今年惠勃爾登從未獲見之最妙雙打、一次四人皆陷於混亂之中、佐藤最佳、常送球入意外之地位、而以猛烈之力擊之、布井較之、相差不遠、潘萊時佳時非、休斯最劣、自勝塞德後、未曾見其好球、</p>
<p>鮑羅屈拉勃魯寗、幾乎遇挫、克培法瓜生先得兩</p>
<p>盤、鮑漸復原狀、一手連勝其次三盤、勃魯寗全局可靠、法瓜生第二盤减色、出球無目的、克培殊神秘、其擊法爲第法爲第一流去、其發球後之一衝甚得力、其攔網及空中壓球、使對方無所措手、但其錯誤之數、亦殊可驚、</p>
<p>畢德門夫人與列特雷女士之勝納脫霍女士與灰丁斯篤夫人、戰法各式俱全、畢列在第一盤中佔先而失落、第二盤隊又失敗、第三盤則一瀉千里、</p>
<p>混合雙打錦標隊德國克拉姆（右）與克拉温格夫人（左）</p>
<p>混合雙打中、高弗列夫人與金斯雷之穩健、與判斷力、勝馬迪夫人與休斯、克拉温格與克拉姆勝蘭英女上與曼爾、兩場皆直落三、在將近黃昏時、希蘭女士與法瓜生在中央場勝灰丁斯篤夫人與柯顯、柯顯衣短褲、引人注意、灰丁斯篤完全减色、希法在失落第一盤後、集中全力、連取</p>
<p>兩盤、</p>

<h3>唯勤勞能致富</h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>我們蘇州鄉下，有幾句歌謠式的格方道：「讀去聲，意謂置產也。）二世享，三世討飯過時光。」意思是說，老子克勤克儉，赤手成家，兒子便養成爲公子哥兒，賣賣吃吃，享福過日子。到了孫子手裡，第一世所置的產業，已給第二世賣完吃掉，而孫子又自幼享用慣了，偷懶成性，於是不得不流而爲乞丐了。道幾句俚辭，多麽深刻而透闢。</p>
<p>帝俄没有傾覆的時候，皇族的養尊處優，是誰都知道的。他們每天不流一滴汗，而過着窮奢極侈的生活，但是革命之後，可就走頭無路。在「不工作，不得食」的革命口號之下，這些有生以來，都過着「不勞而獲」生活的皇族，便只得抱頭鼠竄的流亡到外國。在上海的霞飛路，北四川路，以及虹口一帶，我們時常可以見到向行人舉着右手行禮，伸着左手討錢的白俄浪人，實行其「討飯過時光」的生活。</p>
<p>最没出息的，是貪吃懶做。在這人欲橫流的時代，誰個不相「不勞而獲。」就是家裡僱一個傭婦，走進門便要問一個月有多少「外快」。夥計帮老　做買賣，整天的想增加工資，减少工作時間。雖不能做到不勞而獲的地步，最低也得做到少做工作，多獲酬勞的一步，想不勤勞而致富。呵呵，天下可没有這麽便宜的事。</p>
<p>美國羅斯福大總統，最近發廣播言論，說，不勞而獲，不獨自毀，且亦毀國。美滿安全</p>
<p>之報酬，僅由忠實工作而來。」美國素主「少工作，多報酬」的，如今在這個不景氣中，也提倡中國的古訓，而爲時代靑年所聞而頭痛的「勤勞」來了，可知求「富」，惟有「勤勞」。不肯「勤勞」，老子的產業，兒子果然可以「享」，到了兒子的兒子，就要拿不住啦。</p>
<h3>游泳</h3>
<p>— 夏天吾</p>
<p>溽暑的夏天，最適合而最有樂趣的運動，要算是游泳了。輕拍着淸波，浮蕩在水面，四肢鬆爽，胸懐舒泰，火傘高張之下，只有這一件是唯一樂事。</p>
<p>游泳不僅是一件樂事，也還是非常有益的；因爲游泳是人身全部的機能都平均的需用，不像其他的運動，關係人體的機能，總有一部份偏重。</p>
<p>游泳在學術上有二種正當的說法：生物學上說，人類是下等動物進化的，所以人類在初期胚成的時候，等於下等動物的水居生活，再從兩棲生活進步，才漸漸的搬到陸地上來。所以人類的本能中有游泳的本能性。</p>
<p>如果照物理學說，人體的質量比水體輕，所以人伏在水平綫上，所佔的重量，不會過於同體的水，因此人投在水裏决不會像投一塊石子般的立即沉下去。這裏是證明游泳對於每個人是適合而可能的。</p>
<p>伹，常使我們聽到的說話是「啊丨游泳是危險的，不必冒險去作這危險的嘗試吧丨」的確，每年必有幾條性命爲游泳而犧牲，像今年我們在報上已經看見許多人爲游泳而捨棄了他們的生命。</p>
<p>游泳的發生危險是一種人的膽大心不細，另外是游泳的塲合設備不週到，可是，我們就因噎而廢食嗎？</p>
<p>廚川白村文學十講有話說：「···松荏中有一種是有毒的······但，恐怕中毒，把松荏禁止食用，還不如研究松荏的性質怎樣？爲什麽有毒？使得一般人都知道·····」這雖是對文學的說話！我們爲顧慮游泳的發生危險，也應該研究研究，想想這種說法。</p>
<p>所以，爲喜習游泳的人請命，除誥誡年個人的膽大心細之外，大前提在於游泳的塲合有良好的設備。</p>
<h3>蟲的時代</h3>
<p>— 沈瘦若</p>
<p>螢是時代的眞正明星；因爲它能在黑暗處予人以光明的便利·使人不致走入迷途。</p>
<p>蚊是時代的唯一帝國主義者；因爲它的侵掠政策，在乘人們不知不覺的機會中進行。</p>
<p>蟬是時代的忠實宣傳員；因爲它雖在高唱着救國呀！救國呀！但是它的内心是非常純潔的。</p>
<p>絡緯是時代的實業實行家；因爲它縱在深夜，紡織的機聲總是軋軋不息。</p>
<h3>打</h3>
<p>— 學究</p>
<p>有人說；中國人是素來不喜歡打的，然而一二八之變，十九軍不是也打了幾十天；黑水白山之間，不是至今還有義勇軍在那裏打嗎？再不然，請讀者們查一查二十二年來内戰，究竟打了多少次，咸者吃了晚飯，到街上走走，一定也可以看到許多「打」的把戲。譬如說，小三子吃了阿毛偷了他媽錢來買來的一粒糖，拍了一二次阿毛的破瘪小皮球，便「鞠躬盡瘁義無返顧」的和他的仇敵大妞子打打，而大妞子這壁廂，於是也像孟嘗君食客三千般的「招兵買馬，」糾集一輩打手，整備厮打，這樣你打我打，打個不休，萬一被那家的媽知道了，輕則打着拉塊拉塊的江北話，指桑駡槐地駡了一回：重則屁股晦氣，劈劈拍拍的一頓打丨還有：小孩子們因口没遮攔而打幾下手心，學校裏有日以打球爲事的學生，奶奶們閒日無事，打打麻將，摩登靑年，吃飯飯，　啥做，打打彈子，以及因吃講茶而大打出手，因「三個勿領敎」而鬧成打局，流氓拆梢，宵小被獲，討價討不到，黃包車扯破了一件長衫，都是非打不行。由此看來，幾乎無日不打，無人不歡喜打，不要說别的，就是我們這位素來不喜歡打的不抵抗將軍，不是也愛打高爾夫球嗎？不過，此「打」不是那「打」，然而　爲「打」則一也！</p>
<p>誰說中國人是素來不喜歡打的？</p>
<h3>蘇州是不是要通行汽車？</h3>
<p>— 俞友淸</p>
<p>蘇州是山明水秀的地方，大半的風景區，散佈在西南各地，并且距離得太遠了，譬如素負盛名的鄧尉山的梅花，在春天的時候，能夠去欣賞的，大半是有產階級，坐汽油船，疾馳而去，所耗的代價，當然是不少，普通的人就裏足不前了，此外如天平靈巖，都是前人遺蹟，令人十二分的留戀，可惜距離城關太遠，雖然可以坐輪船，騎驢馬，但是至少使得人們行色怱怱，不能盡興而返，若然天平靈巖鄧尉以及石湖等地，都能行駛汽車，使得别地來的人，更加覺得便利了。</p>
<p>我的意見，與其說在城市通行汽車，不如在名勝之區，快些通行汽車，使得游者便利，而農民也可以借此販賣土產，使農村的經濟，提高一些，我們但看無錫的辦法，在惠山梅園等地方，已通行汽車多年了，我想惠山的土匪，多少可以暢銷些，同時也引起游人的興趣不少。</p>
<p>蘇州的通行汽車，似乎通行在鄉村中，比較城市裏來得好，若然城市通行了汽車，僅不過在景德路護龍街一帶死出風頭，使得人家羨慕你，還不如多開闢幾條風景區的大道吧。</p>
<p>蘇州人比較眼光太小，祗知道在市街上出風頭，不在那風景區上着想，要知在這農村經濟破產的時候，在風景區通行汽車，也未使不是一種補救的辦法。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十四回　授室多艱徘徊憂後顧邀朋小聚　覥記前塵趙自强這才完全明瞭了，今天一次小集會，倒也是桂枝贊成了的。便笑道；很有限的事，談什麽捨得！曼</p>
<p>英道；你聽聽，人家主人翁都願意了，你爲什麽不落得吃上一碗呢？桂枝没有什麽可說的了，只微微一笑。一會兒工夫，伙計將茶湯端着來了。桂枝用小茶匙挑了茶湯吃，忽然一個感想，傳到了心廛。他想着，當日和甘積之訂定三年密約的時候，不也是在這個屋子裏嗎？那個日子偷偷摸摸的和他說那些情話，到後來統歸泡影，若是上次也像現在這樣，經過人說合，經過家庭許可，就不會有後來那一種變局了。這話可又說回來了，像甘積之那種官派十足的家庭，那裏又肯這樣的將就自己。再說趙自强這個人，總是用情很專的，他爲了自己母女有點不滿意軍人，他就願意把連長辭了不幹。那甘二爺可就在他的反面，寗可丢了愛情，也要保持他的飯碗。這樣看起來，還是武人好，認得字的人，反而是靠不住的。他想到了這裏，不由得</p>
<p>臉上紅了起來。田靑和桂枝斜對面坐着，見他臉子上紅紅的，一直紅到脖子上去。就向曼英努了一努嘴。曼英會意，回轉頭來向桂村道；你倒是說話呀！怎麽老是低着頭吃茶湯作什麽？桂枝將一個小銅匙子，不住的在碗沿上刮着，並不說什麽，笑得肩膀連連的聳着，只管是低了頭。田靑道；這該趙連長先說，在新·····不是不是，在女賓一方面，總是後開口的。（一七九）</p>

<p>這是一位朋友的故事，當然他本人是很不贊成，我替他發表的，所以他的名字祇能略而不詳了。他是一位出過洋的工程司，然而他們專長却並不在畫圖打樣，他有一副特别淸爽的頭腦和一套特别巧妙的心思，都非尋常人所能及的，單說他對於子女們所施的敎育，就得呌尋常的人嚇一大跳了。而且還是極幽默他有一位公子，五年前，實足的年齡恰好是二十一歲，那時他還在ＸＸ大學讀書，生性很活潑，經不起受了幾個壞同學的一番引誘之後，便從練習跳舞起，一步一步的邁進，很快活地站到了上海一般標凖大學生的隊伍裡去，實行以學校爲通信地點的浪漫生活。不久，這些情形都結我那朋友知道了，當天他就趕往某校去把他的兒子，帶了回來，並正式向學校當局聲明退學。其時，我和他正在同一個塲所住着，得到了這個消息急忙過去看他，打算替他們父子倆排解排解。不料一進屋子，只見他們兩位都是春風滿面，喜溢眉梢，做老子的既不見在那裡發什麽敎訓，做兒子的也像不曾担過什麽心事一樣，這倒把我弄糊塗了。偏是老張丨丨我朋友丨丨一味儘跟我說空話，急切不讓我有插口請敎的餘地；後來，他兒子上别間屋子裏去了，他才凑近着我問道：</p>
<p>「近來你跟老王還在繼續嫖的工作嗎？」這一問眞是大大的出乎我的意料之外，當然我就急着要請問他爲什麽發此一問，他却很鄭重地給了我一個極透澈，極新頴的說明。</p>
<p>他的理由是說現在的大學堂，對於訓育是太不注意了，大多數的學生，都在那裡過着極浪漫的生活，所以把一個血氣方剛的靑年送進去，要他不被同化，實在是一種極不合理的妄想。至於浪漫的方法，他認爲嫖堂子是最適宜的一種，而且還是道道地地的速成科。所以他當日就再三的懇托我乘間引誘他兒子到小花園會樂里一帶去走走。我起初還不敢擔任，後來他又更進一步的向我說明用意。他說：</p>
<p>「嫖是什麽？我們可以把他比做各種疾病中的傷寒，這種病固然是很危險，但是經此一病之後，你平日所受的風寒，熱毒，感冒等：皆可一掃而光，蒸發凈盡，祇要病後調理得宜，這個人没有永遠不病的希望。你們在窑子裏，要賭就賭，要抽鴉片烟就抽鴉片烟，要跳舞馬上可以帶着人出去，要解决性飢荒，但須化錢，萬無不可之理。總之，一切含有毒質的誘惑，你可以在同一個時候，讓他們把你包圍起來；而其中最强有力的一份當然是女人；窑子裏的女人是永遠虚僞終不能持久，有一天你必能發覺伊們的虚僞，同時，便立刻會把一切享樂的厭棄了。到那時候，你的法身已經堅定，雖入迷樓裸宮，亦必無動於中矣！然後再敎他去念書，這個書才眞正的念進肚子裏去了！」</p>
<p>我聽他說得太動人了，就依着他假痴假呆地把他兒子引上了嫖的路去，最初九個月，這個靑年人眞像發狂似的沉醉着，顚倒着，整天在那裏想盡法子化餞，求快樂，彷彿已把其餘的一切已忘記了一樣。後來，漸漸地看他不很上勁了，終於，在某一天的晚上，他伏在他父親的面前嚎啕大哭起來了。這時候他已經覺悟了，他知道無論什麽享受，快樂，都是虚僞的，暫時的，他已深深地厭棄了！從第二個學期起，他就繼續入校求學，結果是每試必列第一，成爲一個極優秀的靑年，可是他本人却至今還不會知道這是他老子最幽默的家敎的成功咧！</p>

<h3>江西新機早頭批抵申</h3>

<p>江西陳米申存亦微、尙有二千餘包、多數在囤户手中、因存到兩少、行情穩定、故在新米狂落中、並未有十分影響、江西新米早稻亦經上市、惟搬販並無利息、頭批新機早直至昨日到下一百五十六包、貨主因成本昻大、喊價六元六七角、進户祇還六元一二角、相差有半元之鉅、故未接近成議也、</p>
<p>洋米自甬帮迭次辦裝後、市面已得站住、日前甬帮辦去之小絞尙可通劃、昨日續辦三千包、價仍開六元七角半、市面本在看小、因甬胃甚香、暫時站住、西貢一號米本亦看軟、乃被小絞帶定、昨由本街去二百包、價七元七角半、貨品雖較好、然比前市見大一角云、</p>
<h3>標粉廠抛不絕</h3>
<p>昨粉市上下午開盤後、各月份呈先平繼則大落之象、以洋麥仍無報價、故初開時、人心尙平、後以大小廠家、如福新阜豐信大等廠、陸續抛售、致近遠期人心、大受打擊　至目下之實銷、冷淡已臻極點、在上週幾日中、北路方面、尙有辦裝、惟自　市略俏之後、則又沈寂、本來現正月餅汎、銷路當可暢旺、然各廠在事實上、並未多出銷場此種狀態、良係農村經濟、迄未回復、致粉謂遂常趨不景氣矣、收盤結果本月份較前日、</p>
<p>又跌一分半、十月份至一月份各跌三分、二月份跌二分半、</p>
<h3>期麥始穩終降</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份呈初穩後跌之態、以洋麥無報價、人心不免見定、但以粉銷不前、各廠方面、對於標準小麥、自多不卽不離、無意暢取、一部分之廠家、更有套賣期麥、故業外方面、雖心思堅强、但事實如是、終不能逆情過舉、兼聞借麥消息、已有變動、在此粉麥過剩之時、恐前途變化定多也、結果本月份較前日跌四分、十月份跌五分、十一月份跌三分、十二月份跌二分、一月份跌三分、現麥市面、又趨擯局、因標粉麥既又步趨不振、開價當又非殺不可、且一部分堆棧之麥、因暴風雨之故、遭水者不少、一時又難免售、聞祇開揚州麥五百包、價未詳、</p>

<h3>南北貨白蓮大跌小回頭</h3>
<p>白蓮前以銷路不暢、而地頭出貨漸旺故地價由四十餘元隆至三十元、申市亦由四十五六元降至三十六元、跌勢之猛、爲歷來所僅見、但此價確屬低價、故申行均去採辦、市勢稍見轉機、昨據蘭谿訊已回升二元、此間亦升至三十八元、誠可謂大跌小回頭也、</p>
<h3>絲茶浙杭秋乾繭已見樣</h3>

<p>洋莊絲銷沉寂　紐約市塲生絲廠銷仍無轉機、價難上漲、里昻寳銷續呆、昨海外絲電仍不見轉、絲銷沉寂如故、昨祇達昌等進黃白廠經十五包、價仍平疲、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉歐銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊之珍眉綠茶、錦隆協和同孚永興各洋行、鑒於内地來　短竭、與茶價低廉、進意續趨濃厚、全市成交各路綠茶、統計四千七百餘箱、珍眉約佔十分之六七、婺源高莊抽芯貨、預盤開出二百零五元、售價均較前無漲落、針眉秀眉等低莊貨、市盤較前見跌三四元、此外大帮一項、市面亦頗爲疲滯、</p>

<h3>生意經（三十八）談「杏仁」廉</h3>
<p>杏仁產於天津等屬，有甜苦二種。甜杏味甘　有淸香，苦杏味極苦，氣亦淸香</p>
<p>，二者俱有止咳化痰之功。但甜杏尙可作普通食品，苦杏專供藥材之需。茲將各種形式略述如下，以資議别。</p>
<p>㈠白玉扁　粒扁闊而大，色白，身味甘芳。㈡龍王帽，粒大扁闊，帶尖，色紅，身干，呿甘芳。㈢曠杏，粒扁厚，較小，色白，微紅，身干，味甘芳。㈣套扁，粒中，色黃，身干，味甘芳。㈤北山杏，粒扁，帶圓，色紅，身干，味甘芳。㈥九道眉，粒大小扁圓不一，色微紅，身干，味甘芳。略帶苦味。㈦苦杏，粒細，小尖而帶圓，色紅，身干，味極苦，氣芬芳。</p>
<p>甜杏炒熱，香脆可口，或以鹽水炒之，則成「焦鹽杏仁。」或炒熟去衣，再以</p>
<p>白糖製之，則成「杏仁糖。」或以水發透，研之極細，用細布遽去其渣，和水煮沸，再加白糖，則成「杏仁湯。」如欲其汁濃厚，可於未煮前，加菱粉少許。其餘　禚餅空食物，均有差帶之需要，一苦杏除供藥材需要外，尙有市上所售杏仁　，杏仁精，則以之爲原料而已。</p>

<p>錯誤，原是我們日常所不能避免的一種精神不足的表現，因之喜劇的成分，也十九不得不借助於此。但是因悲劇的結果，而故意造成錯誤，成因錯誤的結果，而致發生悲劇的社會事情，在人事日繁的今日，爲數也着實不少。譬如天方夜談中的亞里·吧吧故事内之打混號門的粉筆十字號，斯替文孫的小說TheWrong　Box裏的箱屍之類，雖然都是令人發笑的一種錯誤的顚倒，但其間的嚴重性，也十足可以構得成一齣悲劇。以最普通的幾件日常事例來說，若鄉間老頭兒的娶新娘，當女家相攸的時候，去請一位白面書生來庖代；或投稿不中，假用了女作家的相片名字，去顚倒編輯先生的神志等等，都是如此。</p>
<p>以最近的時事來作譬喻，則偶因姓名的相同，或精神的異狀，而致涉及嫌疑，被捉入官，不得不吃一番大苦的事情，也比比皆是。至若黃河水溢，平時不專心於河工水政的地方負責人員，各以錯誤責人，而不以隕越自勗的那些口實</p>
<p>訟詞，則更是可笑而又可嘆的社會不幸，更無怪乎國府文官處的明令，要把委員的人名遺忘倒錯了。</p>
<h3>倀鬼</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>這一回，倀鬼可眞有些兒醉啦丨他全吃了下去，那麽兩條肥白的大腿，一副透紅的心臟，怪引人的，他全都吃了下去。</p>
<p>酒還没有完呢，可是醉了。没勁兒啦丨他望着老虎，那糊塗蟲正打着瞌睡。打得好味兒啊，糊塗蟲丨倀鬼笑了。</p>
<p>他笑這威嚴的老虎，眞不中用呵丨要不是他領到有人的地方，要不是他騙人們脫下衣裳，老虎的威嚴，使不了啦丨這威嚴是倀鬼的。好得意呵丨</p>
<p>倀鬼原先也是人，可是現在，没半點兒人性啦丨他依附着老虎，又把老虎玩弄着。他陪着老虎去吃人，人，他原先也是人呵丨</p>
<p>可是他吃着同類的人。</p>
<p>他把肥的放進自己的肚子；到老虎口裏的，全是瘦的，羸的。這糊塗蟲却蒙在鼓兒裏哪。看這睡相，多傻！</p>
<p>倀鬼又得意地笑了。</p>
<p>牽動着山風和林木，老虎轉了個側身這回可險些兒嚇壞了倀鬼。醒不得呵！在這個時候，無論如何也醒不得！要是醒來了，找不着那肥白的大腿，透紅的心臟，那可糟啦！</p>
<p>嗅着酒氣，老虎終於醒來了。找不到肥白的大腿，透紅的心臓，他咆哮了，暴怒地。</p>
<p>在老虎的背後，倀鬼發着抖，酒給嚇醒啦！</p>
<p>發覺那酒氣是在倀鬼身上，老虎便厲聲的查問着。</p>
<p>倀鬼畢竟是聰敏的呵，他回答了。他說是後崗的山羊，乘着大王睡覺的時候，用酒把他灌醉了：却倫偷地背着腿和心臟跑了啦。</p>
<p>老虎氣得竪起了尾巴。</p>
<p>山羊是不會吃人的呀，可是老虎不　得。</p>
<p>他把山羊捉了來。在禽獸的世界裏没有法律，也不需要審判。没半句分辯，山羊給做掉啦丨</p>
<p>老虎兀自生着氣。</p>
<p>在岩石的背後，倀鬼捧着肚子，暗暗地笑着。</p>
<h3>打醮</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>打醮的時候又到了。荒野裏，按着東南西北四個方位，各立一根竹竿，竹竿頂上，一連串懸掛着七七四十九隻紙燈。村裏的人都離開了家，擁擠着到打醮的地方去瞧。醮壇設在一片空地上，是把四五隻桌子搭成的。擅頂供着香花水菓，七八個道士雁行般分列在兩邊，中間一個穿法師服裝的誠惶誠恐地在通着疏。</p>
<p>瞧的人就圍繞着壇的四周坐下。一張張長短高矮不齊的板登，都是各人隨身帶來的。老年人低下頭，傾聽着從壇上傳過來的聲音，有時也抬頭向壇上瞧一兩眼眼，光裏充滿着虔敬的意味。年輕人的心則多半不放在壇上，一些少女們的俏媚的眼光，把他們挑引得糢糢糊糊有點醉意了。孩子們有的靠在娘懐裏，乾䀦着小眼珠兒，瞧着壇頂供設的水菓；有的却不安靜地在圈子裏亂跑。</p>
<p>月兒懸在天空，明澈，潔凈。一陣風從由野裏吹來，壇上燈燭的光就歷亂地晃動。四周不時送來唧唧的蟲聲，若斷若續，很是凄切。猛的壇上發出一陣急遽的鈴聲，各種樂器聲也都應和着響了起來，使人驟然感覺極度的緊張。</p>
<p>於是，便有一些人記憶他們不幸的命軍：死亡在瘟疫裏的兒女，失敗了的蠶繭，跌了價的農產品·····他們的眼角邊都有些濕潤了。</p>
<p>在道士們短時間的休息裏，老年人儘嘮叨地談着，雖是爲日無多，但他們對於生活還是抱着憧憬和悲觀。只有那些年輕人是樂天的，他們追逐着幾個回家去的少女，在銀色的月光下，月迷人的聲調唱着誘惑的情歌。</p>
<p>圍繞在壇邊的人漸漸的少了。壇上的樂器聲却又急遽地響了起來。道士們繼續上壇去，做着未完的工作。但注意的人已一個都没有。所有剩下的人，全合　眼皮，糢糢糊糊地在板凳上打盹。有時雖有幾個受着聲浪的刺激，睜開眼來，向壇上瞧望一下，不久便又把眼合上了</p>
<p>朦朧的像輕烟似的七月的夜，便把這些人一視同仁地籠罩了起來。·····</p>
<h3>作家的理想人物</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>幾乎在一個相近的時期裏，「沙寗」出了三個中譯本；然而無論從那一方面講，「沙寗」都不是一本好的書。</p>
<p>那個死於日内瓦的會議席上的蘇俄外交官伏羅夫斯基曾在「巴扎洛夫與沙寗」的題目下，對於「沙寗」這書以及這人物作過嚴峻的批評，有一段話是非引過來不可的：</p>
<p>「······作爲藝術家的阿志巴綏夫是不可和屠格湼夫相比的，丨他也當然不以爲自己是可以和屠格湼夫比肩的作家吧。即看形態底明徹與藝術性，也就毫無可疑地現出二人的才能的差别來，而這差别也在創造的普遍力上返映着。」　　以阿志巴綏夫　「沙寗」　在現　藝術性，來制屠格湼夫的傑作相比較那自然是相差得太遠了；作爲一個藝術家的阿志巴綏夫，恐怕是要屬於二三流的作家之類的吧，在這本四五百頁的「沙寗」上，那塲面，那故事的構型，那人物的風格，總之那作者的創造力，是隨處顯示了充分的薄弱。</p>
<p>但在這裏我想講的，是沙寗這個人物，他不是歷史上的典型，他完全是藝術的幻想的果實，即作者之理想的人物。而這個理想人物，一半緣於作者藝術製作力的薄弱，一半緣於缺欠眞實典型的模特兒，以致形成非常誇大的非常做作的東西</p>
<p>這一點，伏羅夫斯其是同樣地觀察過了。緊接着上面的引文他曾說：</p>
<p>「屠楿湼夫是以盡可能的客觀性寫了使他驚嘆的人物的肖像。巴扎洛夫牽引了他的興味，使他執創作的筆了，但並不曾喚起親密的，同感的反響。「在這裏有着不折不扣的新時代的雛型。」屠格湼夫說。阿志巴綏夫對於沙寗的態度却不是這樣的。對於小說的主人公的他的共鳴是無可疑的事實，他把主人公理想化了。他不止單單描寫實在的典型，他還要把對於他丨即對於作者丨很中意的特質賦與了那典型。「新時代是必需如此的，」他是想這樣說的。這樣存心着，所以和巴扎洛夫是寫生的東西相反沙寗是「做出來」的東西了。沙寗能夠好容易　完成了自己的任務，是靠那爲了主人公的緣故苦慮着更優美的條件（主人公的體力，對立人物的鈍重與卑屈）的作者的這善行的結果；而反之，巴扎洛夫是自由地活動着，服從自己的内在的理論。沙寗是社會的地不合理的存在，和那無用的多餘物的典型有關係；而巴扎洛夫却是必用的，即在社會發展的經濟方則上也尋得到理解。」</p>
<p>不管巴扎洛夫是否眞如這位批評家所說是一個時代的典型或者只是「不折不扣的新時代的雛形」而已，暫不用論，但無論如何，沙寗不是一個時代的典型，連一個雛形也說不上，是無可疑的事實。沙寗和巴扎洛夫同樣是被稱爲虚無主義的代表的人物的，然而在他們之間却有着很大的差别，在巴扎洛夫的虚無主義中，是含着一種新的力量的胚胎，所以這種虚無主義的本身，是成爲一個轉變時代的過渡，是有新的產生的希望的。而反之沙寗的虚無主義完全是絕望的知識階級的精神麻痺的表現。這一點，我們可以由作者表現沙寗的兩個特點上來證實。（未完）</p>

<h3>女人㈩㈢</h3>
<p>— 沈從文</p>
<p>男子重新拾起了一粒石子，奮力向海中抛去。彷彿那麽一來，把一點引起妄想的東西同時也就抛入了海中。他說：「我得把牠摔得極遠極遠，我會作這件事！」但石子多着，他能摔得盡嗎？</p>
<p>女的脫掉短褂後，站起來活動了一下四肢，也拾起了一粒石子向海中摔去，成績似乎并不</p>
<p>出色，女的便解嘲一般說道：</p>
<p>「這種事我不成，這是小孩子作的事！」</p>
<p>兩人想起了那隻擱在淺灘上的小船，便一同跑下去看船，從水拉起擱到砂上，且坐在那船邊玩。玩得正好，男的忽向先前兩人所在的小阜上跑去，過一會，纔又見他跑回來，原來他爲得是去拏女人那件短褂！把短褂拏來時掠到船邊，直到這時兩人似乎才注意到這個男子身上所穿的衣服，不是入水的衣服。這男孩子把船從浴塲方面繞過砲台搖來時，本不預備到水中去，故穿得是一件白色翻領襯衫，一件黃色短袴。當時因爲怱忙援救女子，故從岩壁上直向海中跳下，又來雖離了險境女子蘇醒了，只顧同她談話，把自己全身也忘記了。若干時以來，濕衣在身上還裏着，這時女子才說：</p>
<p>「你衣全濕了，不好受罷。」</p>
<p>「不碍事。」</p>
<p>「你不脫下衣擰擰嗎？」</p>
<p>「不碍事，晒晒就乾了。」</p>
<p>男子一面用木枝畫着砂土，一面同女子談了很多話。他告給了她，關於他自己過去未來的事情，或者說得太多了些，把不必到的也說到了，故後來女人就問他是不是還想下海中去游泳一陣。他說他可以把小船送她回到惠泉浴場去，她却告他不必那麽費事，因爲她的船是</p>
<p>旅館的，走到前面去告給巡警一聲，就不再需要照料了。她自己却想坐車回去。</p>
<p>其實她只是因爲同這男子太接近了，無從認淸這男子。她想讓他走後，再來細細玩味一下這件凑巧的奇遇。</p>
<p>她爬上小阜去，眼看到那男孩子上了船，把船搖着離開了海岸後，這方面搖着手，那方面也搖着手，到後船轉過峭壁不見了，她方重新躺下，甜甜的睡了一陣。</p>
<p>他們第二天又在浴塲中見了一面。</p>
<p>他們第三天又把船沿海搖去，停泊在浴人稀少的長砂旁小灣裏，在原來樹林裏玩了半天。分别時，那女孩子心想：「這倒是很好的，他似乎還不知道說愛誰，但處處見得他愛我！」她用得是快樂與游戲心情，引導這個男孩子的感情到了一個最可信任的地位。她忘了這事情的危險，弄火的照例也就只因爲火的美麗，忘了一切灼手的機會</p>

<h3>精神食糧</h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>給年靑的的一件禮物想來讀者們時常走過四馬路的罷，那條繁華熱鬧的街道？從四馬路的林立的酒館裏發出來的熱烘烘香噴噴的氣味兒是多麽動人啊！雪亮的玻璃窗裏懸掛着的肥而又嫩的雞，美而又肥的鴨····又是多麽誘人啊！你縱然不自認是　餐家，你能諱言當你肚子空虚的時候見了這些會不嚥嚵涎嗎？眞的，前人早已替我們說過：「飲食男女人之大欲存焉，又「食（色）性也。」</p>
<p>我們如果再沿着四馬路朝東走，於是那肥鴨油鷄的空氣便稀薄起來，我們所看到的全是林立的書局了。局的櫥窗裏橫竪直放地陳列着各種各樣的書，有毛邊的，有粉紅色的裝訂的，有科學的，有神怪的，也有「香艶肉感」的，在那裏，我們又可以看到常有許多的人，「駐足而觀」着他們都像恨不得把那些書呑了進去的樣子，他們的「智識慾」是在强烈地衝動着。</p>
<p>所以四馬路中的這兩個地段，於人們，尤其是年靑的人，是有極密切關係的。因爲這無異是他們的食糧庫，前者物質食糧庫，後者是精神食糧庫。物質食糧固然是人類日常所必需，然而精神食糧之於二十世紀的靑年，也已和普通食糧一樣的天也不可缺少了。</p>
<p>年靑的人，如果只是靠着普通的食糧生活着，如果每天只是咬飯喫肉，一些不去求智識上思想上的上進，縱然其健康一天天的增進，肚皮的直徑一天天的擴大，也不過是可鄙的行尸走肉而已，行尸走肉，不是我們的時代所需要的！爲要養成高尙的人格，打定堅固的力量，鍜鍊正確的思想，總之，要造就一個時代的靑年，非賴有豐滿的精神食糧來培植不可的，因此，精神食糧之於年靑人，是多麽的重要而密切啊！（所謂精神食糧，自然不是僅限於書本的，然而書本之爲其重要的大部份的原料，却是不容置疑的，所以我在這裏只就書本而言）。正唯其重要，正唯其密切，所以當我們採取食糧的時候，應當加以特别注意的。</p>
<p>我最近所感到的，年靑的人，尤其是銀行錢莊的夥計，公司洋行的學生，他們在工作之暇，誠然也頗看幾本書的，可是你一檢查他們所看的書，不是「ＸＸＸ醜史」「花塲ＸＸ記」「火燒ＸＸ寺」····，便是「性史」「性的ＸＸ」···，那知道在這裏是得不到高尙的正確智識的這裏只是一些封建的腐敗的神怪的惡劣的描寫。在這裏縱然能得到暫時的享樂，可是你純潔向上的志氣却給牠無形折磨了，你正確精神的思想却給牠永久迷炫了，這不是空話，我們是不難在社會中找出眞實的憑據的；有多少年靑的人爲了性的問題而自殺了，有多少年靑的人忽然想入非非學做劍俠了，這固然也許别有背景，可是你能說不是受這些書本子的影響嗎？覊于勞作的靑年，以難得的閒暇光陰去讀幾本書，而所得到的只是這些惡影響，豈不是寃枉的事！所以，年靑的人，當我們購置一種書本的時候，我們應該先要審愼選擇才好。</p>
<p>同時，我們選定了値得我們閱讀的書以後，我們就應當養蓄成對於這書一層濃厚的興趣，這樣，對於内容的理解，便可格外容易而深刻。古人有以漢書下酒，宋女詞人李易安和她底丈夫賭着果子記憶書中的内容，他們對於讀書的興趣是多麽的濃厚！他們需要精神食糧和普通食糧一樣的重要！這種風度是値得我們年靑人效法的。Samuel　Smiles說得好：「好的書本引導我們到一個最高尙的社會，養成我們最偉大的思想。···牠用着同樣的和靄歡迎任何一個人。牠敎訓我們，當我們年靑的時候；牠安慰我們，當我們衰老了」。</p>
<h3>福氣的太太們</h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>在上海做太太的人眞福氣。老爺如其在軍政界上是個能者多勞的人，管牠要公出洋，廬山會議，做太太的儘可在租界上的别墅中過着逍遙生活。有錢人的生活勝如天堂，尤其是要人太太，吃大菜，看影戲，坐汽車，逛跳舞塲，這類的娱樂，已到不起她們的興趣，她們自有她們的玩法。本來上海的花樣最多，太太們祗要榮意，他幾千塊錢挖一張汽車照會等等，一會時偶然從普陀燒香福乎？累乎？陳喘掉</p>
<p>歸來，就興工鳩木，造一個廟宇般的佛樓，而工成之後，太太早已忘了的，也並不在乎！</p>
<p>從無線電中聽得一隻摩登太太開篇，大概可以歸入買辦階級之類了。高樓大夏，奴僕如雲。紅日西沉，才矯懶的打了呵欠從軟迷迷的銅床上翻身起來。除了小洩大解，有榮太太玉手之外，儘可飯來張口，像代旁者做一世人般的毋須勞動。梅蘭芳到上海，合了一羣小姊妹，自有熟案目預定了包廂，每晚穿紅着綠，亮亮晶晶的，綠油油的，項間，指上，重載了高價的鑽石，顯示三層樓上化了幾毛錢没有吃飯的梅迷者。輪盤賭關了，玩玩回力球，勝負是她們老爺的事。打幾下考而夫，就喊着脚酸腰痛，坐着汽車歸來，呼她們的福氣膏。天明，日出，氣候，在她們好像並不重要似的，吃了睡，睡了吃，福氣的生，福氣的死。</p>
<p>老公從寗波赤脚來滬，靠了太太的帮夫運，一帆順風，獨資開了片店，我們的寗波太太，就是老　娘娘了。從擱樓中爬出來，頂了一所三上三下做二房東，自己住了一個統廂房，餘外的出租，遲開電燈早熄火，藏着白花花大洋推不得存銀行。即使空三個月的屋，也有長脚的老公頂撑，太太仍舊每餐一杯燒酒，四塊醬猪肉。飯後，張家嬸嬸，李家阿姐，十六圈麻雀，嘻嘻哈哈，心寛體胖，穿了一套香雲紗衫褲，走路時像一個爬牆的甲蟲，然而這正是太太的福氣。（作者大略言之，睛以上的太太們别以爲說的正是自己。雖然恭維福氣並不怎樣犯罪，但要求更正等等麻煩手續，那要影響到我們太太的身上了。）</p>
<p>太太嫁了我們賣文的窮老爺，已無福氣可言。硬逼着領着稿費時候，看一次兩毛錢的電影，已是値得在褲帶上打一個大結。伹是在稿費上找回扣，恐遺失圖章起見·是非訂合同不可的。本月份内稿件一多，她早計逄著有多少回扣了。如其我們的文章，常被更正，而觸犯編輯的怒，抛進字紙篦中，豈不僅有的小福氣也影響咱們的太太嗎？</p>
<p>列位太太請了，小不再在這廂賠禮丨</p>

<h3>洗髮</h3>
<p>— 笠笠</p>
<p>在從小菜塲歸來的母親手中接過來的小菜籃裏，發現了一束生着綠油油小葉的荊樹，和一包油炸的巧果，我糢糊的心地中，才記起今天是天上佳偶一年一度相會的佳期丨丨七夕。</p>
<p>眞的，久習慣於國歷的我，對於廢歷却有些忘懐了，若不是茹素的祖母，初一月半的提醒我丨丨據茹素者言，初一月半名爲有緣菜，不可不吃的，有「初一月半不吃菜，（吃菜就是吃素）捉魚船中去投胎」的話，一般恐下世投不着好胎的，雖是每餐非肉不飽的，也勉强的熬了一天。</p>
<p>在短髮茸茸的現在，洗髮是家常便飯般的不足爲奇，可是在髮長萎地的過去，洗髮却是一件隆重的大事，非至七月七日所謂牛女佳期，不准洗髮。</p>
<p>果然，又多又長的頭髮，洗濕後是極不容易乾燥的，散着吧？太不成體統了，我頭皮癢的時候，愛潔者，拚命的梳和篦着頭皮，不幸而頭丨丨頭皮丨丨破血流；媽虎，就用手指爬抓一陣，不愛修指甲的中國婦女，麻姑之爪，成爲納垢之所。並且香油與灰塵的凝合，汗氣和爆花水的結晶，成一種非香非臭，亦香亦臭莫明其妙的氣息，水晶簾下梳頭的當兒，定可使看梳頭的欣賞家掩鼻而瞥</p>
<p>只有七月七日是頭髮的大掃除的時期；陳汚積垢，一掃而空，殘香餘臭，消滅乾凈。披着水淋淋的長髮，散在背後，來習習的凉風在髮上受撫着，輕搖薄扇，慢嚼巧果，談牛女韻事，其樂融融。經過凉風一度的吹拂，沈重的水淋淋的髮兒是漸乾了，輕鬆了，就鬆鬆的梳了一條辮子，拖在背後，隨身體的轉側而左右擺動。</p>
<p>摘下一瓣瓣的荊樹葉兒，用小石臼春了一陣子，就有綠油油，滑膩膩的液體擠出來，放在面盆中和一勺水濾淸後，就成很好的洗髮液了。把頭髮在綠液中浸上十分鐘，稍一搓揉，頭髮就淸潔異常，較諸舶來品的「ＸＸ洗髮液」，經濟實用得多了。可是媚外性特重的上海　，有幾人注意及此？</p>
<p>「荊釵布裙」是從前儉撲的美德，早不適用於現在了。本來這落伍（？）的思想，豈可腐蝕（？）靑年的頭腦？現在所須要的只漂亮，摩登，出足風頭就是啦！管什麽東洋貨西洋貨？荊樹葉液洗頭，又麻煩，又没有香沬，那有洗髮液的又香又方便呢！只要東西妙，管他什麽中國貨，外國貨，不一樣的花錢？</p>
<p>没有國家思想，只知漂亮，不知愛國的麻木的羣衆，他們無國界的大同（？）主義的寛宏的大量，却是値得欽佩的？但、經濟崩潰後的中國，市面凋敝，農村破產，工業之不發達，國人之不知道愛腐國貨　　有些　　　？我爲荊樹悲、爲七夕悲、爲中國之前途悲！</p>

<h3>難做人</h3>
<p>編者先生；我是一個烟紙店裏，剛滿師的學徒；在未學滿之前，常被店裏的小主打駡。因爲學業關係，我終於屈伏在他的威琥底下，抱着不抵抗主義，祇有忍氣吞聲，暗底裏流着眼淚。况且我家鄉遠在甬地，滬上也没有什麽親戚可靠，倘然生意不學回家去，對於父母有何面目呢，被鄰居見之，暗底裏呌聲回湯豆腐干征服自然</p>
<p>，豈不是到自己的霉麽？所以祗有忍耐着；所有一切不白之寃，只好付於天曉得的一句言辭了。昨日爲了一點很小的事情，又被那兇暴的小主，駡了一頓；我稍稍地辯白幾聲，他就惱羞成怒，即被他打了幾掌。我因爲我没有勢力，祇好認自己的誨氣。不到五分鐘，他就即厲聲說道，明天給我滾蛋，···猪··我聽了滾蛋兩字，不覺心裏一酸，熱淚也就流了下來；自思假使我有了銅錢，何必受這般苦頭呢？倘然眞個走了出去，一時找不到相當的職業；若然不走出去，也受不了人間的地獄。眞的呌我滾蛋，我走出之後。可以立即報此仇麽？唉！我現在處於兩難之間，拜懇救苦救難的好</p>
<p>先生，替　　一個良策麽？盼望你近日在貴刋上答覆我，我是十二萬分地感謝的，心緒不安，寫了這一篇，手酸了，停止罷，有不通的地方，請加以删改，敬頌撰安，盧興發謹上，</p>
<p>編者按；盧君與小主人衝突之事，起因何在，未蒙詳示。所以究竟誰是誰非，我們不敢懸揣。我們希望盧君再平心靜氣的反躬自省一次。倘曲在我，應當勇敢地認錯，要求繼續工作。萬一曲在彼方，那末當然無認錯之理，但不妨托人前去說項，冀達蟬聯之望。吃些服前虧，是不甚要緊的：須知與資本家反抗，目下尙非其時。在被壓迫者没有組織以前，各個人另星的反抗，徒然是犧牲自己。</p>

<h3>戰爭與和平㈩㈦（四幕劇）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>第二幕　／逃亡之羣</p>
<p>少爺：南發，拿那個望遠鏡給我。</p>
<p>（勤務兵走進右首車間，找望遠鏡。）姨娘，讀我們來看看那些難民的怪樣兒。姨太太：我不要看，我要進去休憇一會兒。（她走進來，遇着德發，偷偷的在他身上揑了一下。）德發，快拿去夫人：（醒來。）哦！周媽，到了什麽地方？</p>
<p>女僕：太太，還没有開車哩。夫人：還没有開車？有什麽？女僕：這裏還有幾位小姐没有來，還在等着哩。</p>
<p>夫人：哦丨現在什麽時候了？女僕：（在懷裏掏出錶來）十一點十分了。</p>
<p>少爺：没有什麽好看，都是一些嚇死人的怪樣子。··他媽的，那個小孩兒要乳吃，娘不肯，打他了。···哦，一個男人走過來了，太概是丈夫，在駡她了。···現在她拿出乳來給這個男人看，啊，乾的，没有乳的，難怪這小孩哭了。···哼，這個男人抱起小孩兒來了。···哈哈，這倒滿有趣。···哎呀，那個老太婆跌倒了。哎呀，血也跌出來了。···什麽？一個小孩給一個大人打哭了。</p>
<p>姨太太：請問這位太太，這次也是</p>
<p>打算到北京去躱一躱嗎？</p>
<p>夫人：是呀，不過我是到天津去。風聲一天緊一天，到底還是，避一避的好。</p>
<p>聲：賣塘沽對蝦，賣燒鷄鹹蛋。姨太太：那末太太以前並没有逃嗎？</p>
<p>夫人：本來是老早就打算天津去的。可是她們的老爺（指女僕意爲自己的丈夫。）一天到晚忙，又不便請假。因爲身體不好，常常會發些小毛病，必定要有一個親信人服待他。　以我先把一家大小送到天津法租界去。自己帶着一個老媽子，一個老當差的跟着他不走。像我這樣老了，還怕什麽？可是風聲愈緊了，說是幾天以内就要打到北京來。我們家裏的急死了，一定要我逃，别要給他擔心事。他說他自己一兩天以内也要到天津去。</p>
<p>少爺：原來這麽一回事。那個老太婆是賣饅頭的，那個鄉下孩子搶了她一個饅頭，老太婆去追，跌在地上跌壞了。</p>
<p>勤務兵：喂，楊村糕乾。</p>
<p>少爺：咦？可奇怪了。德發，你來瞧。（勤務兵從窗口拿進一塊糕乾在嘴裏吃，一面從少爺手裏接過望遠鏡。）你看那邊田裏在做什麽？</p>
<p>勤務兵：前面三個人後面一個人的是麽？那是耕田呀。</p>
<p>少爺：耕田？耕田爲什麽　有馬？聲：大爺，拿錢給我。</p>
<p>勤務兵；等一會兒，急什麽？···那前面三個人不是在拉犂嗎？</p>
<p>少爺：爲什麽不用牛馬呢？勤務兵：誰知道。聲：大爺快一點兒罷。</p>
<p>勤務兵：你急什麽？我不買了，給還你看你向誰去要錢。（他將吃過的糕乾擲還他。）</p>
<p>聲：大爺！可憐我罷，幾個銅子兒在你們算得什麽？</p>
<p>少爺：給他罷，幾個銅子兒也要和别人鬧。喂，（向賣糕者）我問你，爲什麽鄉下用人耕田的。</p>

<h3>The Beiping Authorities Decide to Thoroughly Resolve the Situation in Ji Province</h3>
<p>Regarding Fang Zhenwu, leniency is possible, and instructions have been telegraphed to Song to act accordingly. Ji Hongchang is attempting to flee to Dushikou. Liu Guitang is willing to drive out Fang and Ji. (Beiping) The situation in Chahar is about to come to an end. Fang is still requesting permission to go abroad for inspection under a nominal title. Ji, finding himself at the end of his rope, is also making the same request. Song has telegraphed He with this intention, requesting instructions on how to handle it. It is heard that the authorities are willing to be lenient towards Fang, but due to Ji's connection with communism, a thorough resolution has been decided upon. Instructions have been telegraphed to Song. Song has returned to Zhangbei from Shangdu and will handle the Fang and Ji problems according to the opinions of the Beiping authorities. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangbei Dispatch: Ji Hongchang led a small number of Communist elements and over a thousand remnants, attempting to flee east to Dushikou. Song dispatched Zhang Lingyun, Nie Yuling, Zhao Dengyu, and Wei Lantian's troops to intercept them. Currently, Ji is detouring, causing disturbances in Dushikou. Yesterday, Ji, under duress, sent his Chief of Staff, Sun, to request Song to accept his troops. Ji himself is willing to go abroad. However, Ji is fickle, and no one believes him. Fang is leading a small contingent in Dushikou. Liu Guitang has repeatedly advised him to return his troops to the government and ensure his personal safety, but Fang remains obstinate. It is feared that force will still be needed to resolve the situation. Liu Guitang sent his Deputy Chief of Staff, Tian, to Zhangbei to meet with Song, requesting instructions on strategy and expressing his willingness to drive out both Fang and Ji's forces with all his strength. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangbei Dispatch: Ji Hongchang, on the night of the 3rd, led Zhang Mutao and the youth corps guards of the cadres to Ershilinaobao. On the morning of the 4th, he sent a representative to Ertaizi to meet with Song, while simultaneously moving his troops, attempting to flee to Dushikou. On the 4th, Song ordered Zhang Lingyun and Nie Yuling's forces to intercept them separately and dispatched Zhao Dengyu's division and Ning Dianwu and Wang Changhai's regiments to rush to the front lines overnight, forming a three-sided encirclement. Because Song considers Ji to be cunning, he has decided to resolve the situation by force. On the morning of the 5th, he again ordered the troops to begin advancing to clear out the remnants, and used telephone communication to order the local militias to intercept them. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangbei Dispatch: Zhao Dengyu, upon being summoned by Song, came to Zhangbei. His troops were transferred to Zhangbei and Wanquan counties. Wang Ziliang's regiment from Shangdu was ordered to return to Zhangbei. Tan Zixin's department of the Temporarily Compiled 10th Division has begun to move to Yanqing. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Embarrassing State of Puppet Organizations Under Japanese Coercion</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Shenyang reports: (1) The basic military force of the puppet organization, including Yu Zhishan, Wang Dianzhong, and six other brigades, are now all concentrated within Liaoning Province. When the number of soldiers decreases due to desertion or death, the Japanese refuse to allow replenishment, intending to gradually reduce their strength and lead them to extinction. (2) In order to reclaim the so-called extraterritorial rights, the puppet state will organize a committee to abolish extraterritorial rights. (3) They are organizing a "Justice Corps" to assassinate patriotic youth to prevent people in the Northeast from retaining a concept of the motherland. (4) The police department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs has expanded its organization and been renamed the Police Bureau, becoming an independent organ. (5) When official positions in the puppet state become vacant, they are immediately filled by Japanese or Korean individuals. (6) In all schools, classes must be taught in Japanese. The Japanese in the Northeast are completely employing methods of threat and enticement. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Negotiations Underway With the Japanese Regarding the Luandong Bandit Suppression Incident</h3>

He stated that the issue of receiving the various passes of the Great Wall fell within the scope of the Political Readjustment Committee and that after Huang Fu returned north, he would negotiate with the Japanese. The clearing of bandit disturbances in Luandong falls under the reception committee and will be handled by the Political Readjustment Committee directing the Hebei Provincial Government and the reception committee. The military sub-committee will not send troops to the war zone to suppress bandits. After Yin and others visited He, it was decided that Liu Shisun would go to Tianjin to contact Nakamura, the Japanese commander stationed in Tianjin. Yin Tong will remain in Beiping to contact Shibayama, the Japanese military attaché, for private discussions, requesting cooperation in suppressing bandits. After Yu Xuezhong returns to Tianjin and obtains the agreement of the Japanese side, troops will be dispatched to Luandong to suppress the bandits. After the bandit suppression is completed, those troops will be withdrawn from the war zone. The establishment of inspectors in Luandong and northern Beiping will be decided after Yu arrives in Tianjin. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

They then flew toward Luowenyu, scattering many leaflets. The reception in Zunhua has only reached half completion. The third district north of the Great Wall has not yet been received. Xinglong County has only received the twenty-four townships south of the Great Wall, with the rest still under negotiation. However, bandits are rampant in various counties, and the people are not living in peace. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The 19th Route Army Launched a General Offensive on Youxi Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cai Mobilizes Six Regiments to Advance and Suppress</p>
<p>Mao Weisheng Flies to Yong'an to Command</p>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan Appointed as Fuzhou City Defense Commander. Chen Jiliang Arrives at Mawei and Transfers to the Province to Visit Jiang Guangnai to Discuss Naval and Land Defense. (Xiamen) Youxi is the central hub of the upper reaches of the Min River, connecting the north and south of Fujian. Its location is extremely important. The main force of the Communist bandits is concentrated in Youxi, plotting to occupy Shuikou. Cai Tingkai mobilized six regiments from the 61st and 78th Divisions and gathered them in Yong'an. On the morning of the 5th, he sent a plane to Quanzhou to carry Mao Weisheng directly to Yong'an to command. A general offensive on Youxi was set for the evening of the 5th.

<p>(Fuzhou) Although the situation of the Communist bandits in the northwestern part of Fujian Province has improved recently, the authorities here are implementing censorship of all news. The panic that the Red Army will occupy Fuzhou has been eliminated. Although a few people are still anxious, most residents believe that Fuzhou is safe. Officials claim that Yanping is still in the hands of government troops. Even if the city has fallen, it would still take the Communist bandits several days to advance on Fuzhou. Officials believe that the Red Army's goal is not Fuzhou, as it fears a clash with foreign warships. Because of the censorship of news, rumors have resurfaced, but they are only believed by the uneducated. The situation within the areas occupied by the bandits is unknown, although there are reports from refugees, but the true situation is still unclear, but it is known that all places have been ravaged.

<p>Scheduled for One Month. Took Off from Jinan Yesterday, Passing Through Xubeng and Arriving in Nanjing.</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 7:45 AM, Sun Tonggang and Wang Zuwen flew from Jinan to Bengbu. Many people came to see them off, including Sun's father, brother, sister-in-law, and family members. Sun approached his father and bowed as a greeting. His father, with a smile and tears in his eyes, instructed him to take care of himself. Then, they took off, circling the field three times. The send-off party and Sun and Wang waved their towels to each other as a farewell, and then they flew south. Before leaving, they received two telegrams: one from Lin Wojang of the Shanghai Aviation Association, inquiring about the flight schedule and preparing to welcome them, and one from Shao in Shaanxi, welcoming them to visit. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Sun Tonggang's plane arrived in Xuzhou at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 5th, flying low around the city, distributing aviation patriotism leaflets, and deliberately tilting the fuselage, gliding sideways, circling freely. At the time, the Yunlong Mountain area was holding a sports meeting, and tens of thousands of people looked up, applauding like thunder. Because Sun's plane was forced to land in Xuzhou last time due to thunderstorms and there was no time to welcome him, representatives from all walks of life were sent to the airport to greet him. Reporters were also standing by at the airport. After Sun's plane circled the city once, it did not land and flew south. The representatives then dispersed. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Bengbu) Sun Tonggang, who began his nationwide flight, flew south from Jinan with Wang Zuwen in a Curtiss aircraft on the morning of the 5th. Before noon, they mistakenly arrived at Linhuai and landed in a watermelon field. Wang disembarked and took a car to Nanjing. Sun flew west, arriving in Bengbu at 12:30 PM and landing at the airport. The aviation station provided lunch. Sun said that his flight across the country is scheduled for one month. For the development of aviation in our country, it is appropriate to promote civilian gliders, because they are easy to manufacture, do not use gasoline, and can be driven by wind, making them the most economical. These aircraft have recently become very popular in Germany. He plans to return to Germany to learn how to manufacture airplanes after flying around the country for a month. He flew to Nanjing at 2:30 PM. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Aviator Sun Tonggang flew from Jinan to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 5th. More than 300 people from all walks of life arrived at the airport to welcome him. A welcome banquet was held at the Central Hotel that evening. Dozens of representatives from all walks of life attended. Lei Zhen delivered a welcome speech, followed by Zhou Bangshi speaking on behalf of the press. Sun Tonggang replied that his aim this time was to awaken public sympathy for aviation and that they should not welcome him personally, but should focus on the idea of saving the country through aviation. Sun is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the morning of the 6th to participate in the naming ceremony of five aircraft on the 9th of the Aviation Association, and then fly along the Yangtze River to Hankou, Changsha, and then transfer to Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Xi'an. If there is enough fuel, he will fly to Suzhou and then fly back to North China to visit the war zones. The estimated flight time is about one month. He has prepared 300,000 leaflets to distribute to the people in various places. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After receiving news on the 4th that Sun Tonggang would fly from Jinan to Nanjing on the 5th, all sectors of the capital began to prepare for a welcome. By 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, those going to the airport to welcome him were streaming continuously. The Aviation Administration sent three Curtiss bombers, which began flying in formation at high altitude over the capital at 2:00 PM to show their welcome. They also sent a TO-5 training aircraft, piloted by pilot Qun Luo and Hu Cheng, director of the Aviation Administration's office in Nanjing, to guide Sun's aircraft. The welcomers at the airport held party and national flags and stood waiting, including all staff of the Central Party Headquarters, Fang Zhi, Zhang Yuanliang, Lei Zhen, and all staff of the Municipal Party Committee, Xiao Zheng, a special commissioner sent by the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters, who also rushed to Nanjing to welcome him, the Aviation Administration's secretary, squadron leader, station chief, and representatives from all walks of life in Nanjing and reporters, over 600 people in total. Sun's plane arrived at the Ming Palace airport at 4:00 PM, descending and ascending again and performing a rapid turn demonstration. The leading TO-5 aircraft followed suit, performing the same demonstration. Five minutes later, it began to land at the airport. Reporters and the film crew of the Central Propaganda Department took photos and film. After Sun got off the plane, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers, and distributed aviation patriotism leaflets at the airport. He then went to the airport station chief's office to rest briefly and then took a car to Lizi Society, where he stayed. At 7:00 PM, all circles gave a banquet at the Central Hotel to welcome him. Sun told reporters that this time he flew nationwide with Wang Zuwen, who is also a student of aviation in Germany, who returned to China two years ago. He took off from Jinan on the morning of the 5th, passed Fengyang, planning to land. He failed to reach the airport because he mistakenly flew and landed in a Zhenyang watermelon field. Because the watermelons were piled up and it was not easy to fly, Wang Zuwen got off the plane and took a train to Nanjing. He arrived at Bengbu at 12:40 PM, received a warm welcome and had lunch. He took off at 2:00 PM and flew to Nanjing. He plans to fly from Nanjing to Shanghai at 9:30 AM on the 6th, staying for two or three days. Whether to fly with Chen Wenlin depends on meeting Chen in Shanghai. From Shanghai, he will continue to fly to Hangzhou, staying for a week, then fly to Anqing, Hankou, Changsha, and return to Hankou, flying to Zhumadian, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and reaching Xi'an. He will then decide whether to fly to Lanzhou. From Lanzhou, he will return to Bian, via He, Ding, Datong, Zhangjiakou, and Suiyuan to Beiping. He plans to stay for a week to visit the war zones and then fly to Tianjin via Qingdao back to Jinan before flying to various disaster areas in Shandong Province to inspect the seriously affected areas. He hopes that the central government will quickly take measures to provide relief. (5th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Northeast Volunteer Army's Struggle</h3>
<p>News of the Northeast Volunteer Army's activities has recently been continuously transmitted by various news agencies, coming into contact with the eyes and ears of the people of the country. Their activities are mostly in areas such as Andong and Kaiyuan, where the Japanese army does not have defenses, and in remote counties such as Dongning and Wangqing. The number of people in each unit is mostly no more than two or three thousand, and as few as five or six hundred. However, under the current situation, there are still some people in various parts of the Northeast, which has been occupied for nearly two years, resisting the Japanese puppets arduously, which is truly a glimmer of hope for the future recovery of our lost land. Those living in seclusion rejoice at the sound of footsteps in an empty valley. Shouldn't the people of the country also find some comfort in this?</p>
<p>Recalling last year after the rise of the Green Gauze Curtain, patriotic people in the Northeast joined together to rise up, and the power of the Volunteer Army was once very strong. During the general offensive in August, the scope of activities ranged from Changchun in the north to Niuzhuang and Yingkou in the south, and across the Liaodong region. The number of participants reached more than 100,000. The fierce battle of Haicheng Dashiqiao and the attack on the South Manchurian Railway's subsidiary areas shocked the Japanese. In particular, the repeated attacks on Shenyang, where the Japanese army headquarters was stationed, fully demonstrated the spirit of adventure and courage. In the end, because the gathered troops were not well-trained and the weapons were not new and sharp, there was no support and no supplies. After two months of arduous struggle, they suffered heavy damage. By October, with the Green Gauze Curtain fallen, they lost their basis for support and declined. Now, they are rising again, but they are already small and scattered units. Moreover, the Japanese have been managing the Northeast for another year. It is not easy to rise up and act. We cannot help but feel emotional when we recall the grandeur of the Volunteer Army last year and observe the current situation. However, this is limited by the environment, not by the decline of the patriotic spirit of the people of the Northeast, nor by the reduction of their fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese military department released news stating that the number of bandits in their eyes has decreased from 290,000 at the most rampant time last year to 54,000. They also said that the number of damages on the railways in Northeast was 170 times last August, and that there have been no such damages this August. We speculate that the Japanese propagandist must have had a happy look on his face when releasing these figures, but we wonder what the Chinese people think when they hear this. The patriotic activities of the people in the Northeast, after a year, have seen such changes in prosperity and decline. If the Japanese are given more time to arrange and deploy, I am afraid that it will be impossible to see the Volunteer Army acting sporadically as they are today.</p>
<p>If China is unwilling to give up the Northeast and still wants to recover this lost land of more than 3.8 million square miles, it is necessary to maintain the anti-Japanese activities of the people in the Northeast and prevent them from disappearing. If we want the people of the Northeast to continue to resist Japan and fight unyieldingly, the people in Guan Nei must fulfill their responsibility to provide assistance remotely. This is what we hope for in the early resolution of the "patriotic donation embezzlement case" so that the agencies handling the donations can restore social credit and continue to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<h3>The Eastern Section of the Chinese Eastern Railway Is Chaotic, and the Volunteer Army Is Powerful</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is still very chaotic. Japanese and foreign nationals are fleeing to seek refuge, especially in Yilan. It is said that there are more than 1,000 members of the Volunteer Army in the area, who often raid Japanese and Korean residents at night. The Japanese are deeply disturbed and have dispatched a large force to suppress them, but it has not been effective so far. (5th Day Hualian Telegram)</p>
<h3>Seven Puppet Ships Evacuate to Fujin</h3>
<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese sources, seven puppet Jiangfang ships ordered to attack the Volunteer Army in Hulin suffered heavy losses in the Hulin area. One puppet ship was seized by the Volunteer Army. Moreover, because it is the season when the five grains are abundant, the puppet army did not dare to stay for long and took a loss. Yesterday, they evacuated 1,300 refugees to Fujin. (5th Day Hualian News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Investors Arrive in Harbin to Conduct On-Site Surveys of Investment in "Manchukuo"</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Olivier, a French capitalist from the Japanese-French Investment Group for "Manchukuo," recently arrived in Harbin from Tokyo via Changchun.</p>
<p>He told reporters that he came to Harbin to investigate the development of Manchurian resources. The Japanese-French Investment Group for "Manchukuo," recently organized in Tokyo, must continue to be equipped with content and is currently under consideration. Fujimura Otoko originally planned to come with him, but stopped due to an incident. The rumor that the capital of the Japanese-French Investment Group for "Manchukuo" is ten billion or one hundred billion is not true. However, it is true that French capitalists are paying close attention to the Manchurian issue. (5th Day Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Northeast Region: The 理教 Sect Secretly Planned to Control and Utilize</h3>
<p>(Dalian) In Manchuria, the 理教 (Lǐjiào) sect has two million followers. The Japanese authorities are paying close attention to them. The Kwantung Army is eager to utilize this group to enhance the sense of Eastern friendship, planning to place the Manchurian 理教 under unified jurisdiction, and change its name for better use. It is widely acknowledged that the 理教 has recently gained considerable influence in Manchuria. Yanagawa, the Vice Minister of the Japanese Army, recently invited eight important figures of the 理教 to Japan for liaison. An officer of the Dalian Police Department (who has written about the 理教) recently returned from Changchun. He discussed methods of utilizing the 理教 with key figures of the Kwantung Army, believing that there is a possibility of developing this group according to general procedures. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3>Revolution Erupts in Cuba Barely a Decade After the New President Took Office</h3>
<p>Army and Navy Soldiers Secretly Launch a Bloodless Coup, Expected to Succeed Soon. A Provisional Government Composed of 19 Leaders Forces President Cespedes to Relinquish Power.</p>
<p>Havana: Cuba was hit by a storm at the end of last week, and before the people could recover, a revolution broke out again, due to the disappointment of the army and navy. Sergeant Batista, supported by junior officers, has taken over the command of the Cuban National Defense Force, with the aim of establishing a truly revolutionary government. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Havana: The provisional government formed by the 19 revolutionary leaders has elected five administrators and sent them to the presidential palace to inform President Cespedes that they are now taking over power. Dr. Cespedes was elected president after President Machado was forced to resign, on August 25th. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Havana: Tonight, there was a second revolution by army and navy soldiers in Cuba, but according to their spokesperson, there is no intention to oust President Cespedes, only to replace the army and navy officers who were attached to the former president. All current army and navy officers have been forced to resign, stripped of their uniforms, and many of the high-ranking ones have been detained. The police have also joined the revolution. Army Sergeant Gang Chai'er has been promoted to Chief of Staff. He is said to have no communist tendencies, but comes from a revolutionary family and is deeply influenced by revolutionary ideas. However, at this time, there are no experienced army and navy commanders in charge of the revolutionary movement. It is said that the Cuban President and the U.S. Ambassador Wells are deeply concerned that the tide of anger will break out, with radicals inciting unrest, leading to the risk of the army being out of control. They are considering asking the United States to send warships from Guantanamo to suppress the situation. The newly promoted officers are now asking the President to dismiss all military officers who served during the Machado administration and appoint new people. If their request is granted, senior generals will likely be selected from those who have already retired, and middle and lower ranks will be selected from the soldiers. The President is hesitant to agree lightly, fearing that this will reduce the effectiveness of the army. It is not yet clear when this revolutionary movement began. It is suspected that former President Menocal is behind the scenes, but Gang Chai'er denies this, saying that it is only because the soldiers are angry at the deep-seated problems in the military, so they decided to expel the corrupt generals. However, the fact that this revolution arose quietly, bloodlessly, and succeeded immediately shows that there must be someone with deep military talents planning it in the middle. Therefore, they were able to accomplish a major task in two hours. A committee was elected to meet with the President, informing him that the soldiers and officers have taken over the national defense forces, but have no intention of overthrowing the government, only to dismiss the military officers attached to Machado. Those who can prove that they were not involved in Machado's tyranny will still be allowed to return to their posts and obey orders, but they must provide evidence. Currently, the army and navy troops have no intention of surrounding the presidential palace and forcing the President to accept their demands. It is said that President Cespedes insists that experienced military officers should remain in their positions, and the right to choose should be in the hands of the President. U.S. Ambassador Wells has reported the details of the revolution to Washington for instructions. As for the police officers, they have not been expelled and are still serving as before, because most of those who held power during the Machado era have already been replaced.

<h3>U.S. Navy's Huge Budget Breaks 400 Million Gold Dollars</h3>
<p>In addition to actively building new ships, 632 aircraft will be built, with expenses paid from the recovery fund.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from the Ministry of the Navy, the U.S. Navy's budget for 1934 is US$406 million, surpassing the US$380 million in 1931, the highest record since the Washington Conference. The U.S. Navy's budget passed by the next year's parliament is US$323,486,925, of which US$2 to 3 million is said to be reduced. On the other hand, the United States plans to spend US$130 million from the 3.3 billion industrial recovery fund to expand the navy. As a result, the actual budget for next year is as follows: New ship construction budget of US$43.9 million, recovery fund expenditure of US$46 million, totaling US$89.91 million. Ship construction budget of US$5.5 million, recovery fund expenditure of US$30 million, totaling US$35.55 million. Aircraft construction budget of US$8.1 million, land and water equipment costs of US$1.946 million, other budget of US$264.029 million, totaling US$406 million. The expansion of such a huge U.S. Navy is remarkable. (Dentsu Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson requested President Roosevelt to build 632 aircraft of various types, with an expenditure of $30 million from the public works fund. These aircraft are to replace the same number of aircraft currently carried on aircraft carriers and cruisers, and the current aircraft are to be discarded. Regarding the expenditure of the funds, Secretary of the Interior Ikes, who is in charge of the above-mentioned public works, recently met with Roosevelt at Hyde Park to consult on the possibility. It is said that it is very likely to be realized.</p>
<h3>Britain Quickly Catches Up with Japan's Second Supplementary Plan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The United States is implementing a large-scale shipbuilding plan, and Britain has also been stimulated to carry out supplementary ship building as a countermeasure. When U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson signed the implementation plan one day, he declared that the United States would become the world's number one naval power, with the intention of criticizing Japan's second supplementary plan. However, the result unexpectedly stimulated Britain, the great naval power on the other side of the Atlantic, and led to the current shipbuilding competition. Britain's shipbuilding plan will inevitably affect France, Italy, and other countries. The Second Washington Conference will be held in two years, but countries around the world are once again realizing the shipbuilding competition that took place in 1920, just before the First Washington Conference. While Britain and the United States are implementing their plans with their abundant financial resources, Japan's second supplementary plan is even more necessary. The Disarmament Conference in 1935 adds to the importance and difficulty of the responsibility. (Nichi-Rengo Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3>United States Celebrates Labor Day Expanding the Blue Eagle Movement</h3>
<p>Johnson Encourages People to Buy, Promoting Industrial and Commercial Recovery. Two Million Unemployed Men and Women Have Found Work. Automobile King Refuses Industry Regulations, A Blemish.</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the National Labor Day is celebrated throughout the country, initiated by the government, in order to settle unemployed people in the United States. The Blue Eagle of the National Recovery Administration is visible everywhere, and increasing wages is the main theme of public gatherings everywhere. The celebration of Labor Day throughout the day shows that the industrial recovery movement has reached its peak, but not yet the end. The automobile industry regulations will be implemented tomorrow, but Ford has not yet agreed, which is the only incongruous thing in today's celebration. In addition, there is still a shortage of agreement between coal mine owners and miners, which is a shortcoming of today's celebration. Many cities across the country held meetings and speeches to support President Roosevelt's plan to promote national prosperity. William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, said in Akron that the General Labor Union will petition the court to punish employers who violate industry regulations. Industry regulations clearly allow workers to engage in free organization in order to conduct collective bargaining. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Chicago: Today, a citizens' assembly was held in the Chicago Exposition Square to celebrate Labor Day. Most of the participants were workers. Johnson, the Executive Officer of Industrial Recovery Administration, said in his speech that if the people can cooperate with the government and industry and are willing to buy goods, the United States will be able to escape the economic downturn and re-enter the path of prosperity before the snowflakes fly. The industrial sector is doing its best in its duties and believes that it will continue to do so in the future. The government has completed its recovery plan and has the possibility of fully restoring the economy. Therefore, the final decision at this time is in your hands. If you can spend the increased wages on buying goods, industries and businesses will be able to hire more people, and you can expect more income. In short, the date of our escape from decline is determined by your own decision. As for savings, you can not talk about it for the time being, because hoarding money at this time is tantamount to hoarding food during wartime, which is of no benefit to both the public and private sectors. He believes that if the increased wages can be used to promote commerce at this time, the people of the country can all find work in a few months, and you can then engage in savings, in order to plan for the rest of your life. Johnson's speech was broadcast across the country by radio. At the same time, William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, also said in Akron that the Industrial Recovery Administration has made extraordinary progress in seeking the recovery of industry and commerce. Subsequently, it was proved that 2,033,000 unemployed men and women had regained work, and praised the government's resolute abolition of child labor, and said that the industrial sector must move further forward in the process of shortening working hours, in order to absorb unemployed workers in the country. If we want to succeed, we must immediately implement the 30-hour week system. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

<h3>Eighteen New Industry Regulations Signed</h3>
<p>(Washington) Currently, a total of 18 industry regulations have been signed by Roosevelt, and more than 30 are being drafted. The most important of these is the coal industry regulations. The general public believes that 350 industry regulations must be formulated to cover all industries. General Johnson believes that all employers are now acting in accordance with industry regulations, but the nature of the regulations is divided into long-term and temporary.

<h3>British Trade Unions Enthusiastically Praise</h3>
<p>(London) Walker, chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, said in his speech at the meeting today that he praised U.S. President Roosevelt's recovery policy enthusiastically and judiciously. He said that the U.S. President's constant protests against reducing wages as a way to deal with commercial depression have authorized the trade unions with authority, and the U.S. President has also taken practical measures to show that economic individualism is not suitable in theory and practice. Walker was a Labour Party Member of Parliament, and has been elected as an executive member of the Trade Union Congress every year since 1921. Last year, he was elected as chairman of the Congress. The Congress then resolved to organize a small committee to meet with the delegation of 500 unemployed workers who walked from Brighton to London tomorrow, and listen to their submissions. The Trade Union Congress currently has 3,368,000 members, a decrease of more than 245,000 from the previous Congress. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>Herriot in Moscow</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, met with former French Prime Minister Herriot and French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Alphand, for more than an hour today. Herriot's party visited the Moscow Revolutionary Museum yesterday morning. When the director of the museum, Histakov, delivered a welcome speech, he attached special importance to the fact that Russian workers were inspired by the French Revolution and the struggles of the masses during the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 and the heroic Paris Commune period in carrying out their struggle against autocracy and the capitalist system. Herriot said, "We have not forgotten the great revolution that divided the history of France, so we give great and sincere sympathy to your struggle against autocracy in the past and your efforts to build a new society, and our task is to enhance the friendship between the peoples of the two great countries of France and the Soviet Union." Yesterday afternoon, the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs hosted a banquet for Herriot's party and Alphand, accompanied by senior Soviet government officials such as People's Committee Chairman Molotov, Deputy Foreign Committee Chairman Krestinsky, and Karakhan. Last night, Litvinov hosted Herriot again, and those present included the leaders of the diplomatic corps in Moscow, officials of the Soviet government, the most famous representatives of the Soviet scientific and artistic circles, and representatives of the Soviet and foreign newspapers.

<h3>Hurricane, Unseen in Sixty Years, Hits U.S. Territory in Two Ways</h3>
<p>Devastates Florida and Texas, Followed by Flooding, 400,000 Homeless</p>
<p>(New York) After the storm blew through the Everglades lowlands of Cuba, killing more than 100 people and injuring thousands, it ravaged Florida today. Another storm invaded Texas from the Gulf of Mexico. After the wind, followed by heavy rain, people are rushing to escape.

Houses and field crops in Florida suffered heavy losses, but the number of lives lost has not yet been determined. Residents of many villages and towns between Corpus Christi and Freeport, Texas have fled. The Texas coast from Port Arthur to Brownsville has become a swamp.

<h3>A New Invention by an Argentine Pilot</h3>
<p>Reuters, Madrid Dispatch: Talking newspapers, or talking columns in ordinary newspapers, are about to become a reality. An Argentine pilot, Mr. Kruto, currently residing in Madrid, has invented a type of phonograph using thin sheets of soft paper instead of hard records. This is achieved through photographic and lithographic methods. Kruto calls his invention the "photoprint phonograph." His specially made paper is placed on the cylinder of the device, and when electric light is shone upon the paper, it produces sound. This light replaces the needle used in today's records. Kruto can create talking paper from entire operas or novels, and short songs and melodies are even easier to produce. Kruto believes his invention can create talking newspapers.</p>

<p>Shen Honglie Travels Between Qingdao and Jinan</p>
<p>(Jinan) Yu Xuezhong's special train arrived in Jinan at 8:00 AM. Han Fuju, Shen Honglie, and other important figures welcomed him at the station. They went to the provincial government together. At noon, Han hosted a banquet for Yu at Shen's residence. Yu stated that this trip to Nanjing and Lushan was to report on the reception of Luandong and to observe the politics of the southern provinces, thus making a lengthy stay. Jiang and Wang believe that North China affairs should be handled diplomatically by the Political Affairs Committee and militarily by the Military Affairs Branch. There are over 300,000 troops stationed in Hebei and Chahar, with monthly military expenses of 5.7 million. Security in Luandong is of utmost importance, and it is planned to increase the security forces for suppression. The central government has agreed to subsidize Hebei's finances, believing that if the finances are managed well, everything else will be managed well. One reason for coming to Jinan is because it is his hometown, and another is because Han provided significant help to Hebei after the September 18th Incident. He originally planned to return to his ancestral home in Penglai, but due to the urgency of reorganizing Luandong, he has cancelled the plan and will return to Tianjin on the evening of the 9th.

<h3>Director of Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau Discusses the Issue of Lifting the Ban on Prostitution</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chongzhi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said that since the establishment of the capital, a ban on prostitution has been issued, but private prostitutes are lurking in the city, numbering in the thousands. The hidden dangers are deeper and greater than those of public prostitutes. The Social Affairs Bureau is studying a fundamental solution and plans to build a large-scale reception center to accommodate these people and teach them a trade. However, given that the municipal treasury does not have such a large sum of money, there is a proposal to open prostitution. Outsiders are unaware of this and are strongly opposed. In fact, it is easy to talk about banning prostitution and addressing the root causes, but it is difficult to implement, leaving endless hidden dangers for society. The municipal government has run a vagrant factory, but it has not achieved any practical results and has lost 100,000 yuan. Currently, there is a section of barren land in Nanjing being sought as a large-scale base for building a relief home, but this cannot be realized in the short term. Currently, private prostitutes are rampant, and the Capital Police Department is conducting large-scale arrests, but there is no way to resettle the arrested private prostitutes. Although there is a written pledge to deport them, this is not a fundamental solution. The Social Affairs Bureau, therefore, has a plan to first publicly lift the ban and then seek to eliminate it, so it has drafted a proposal to open prostitution and submitted it to the municipal government to be forwarded to the central government for approval.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Zhangzhou: To all at Shen Bao. Regarding a telegram recently sent to the Wuxi County Government, which reads: "Having read a report that someone claiming to be Zhang Haohun committed suicide at Mengshen Temple in your jurisdiction and was rescued, it has been determined that the unit stationed in Fuzhou only has a training regiment, not a training team, and the entire training regiment does not have a Zhang Haohun. Wu Kangnan is the regiment commander, not a company commander. Zhang Yan, when he was the deputy commander of the 61st Division, was stationed in Quanzhou. In late March, he led his troops north to resist the Japanese. In early July, he returned to station in Yongding and took office as the commander of the 49th Division. He has not been stationed in Fuzhou. Since our unit has been stationed in Fuzhou, the patrol team has never had any conflict with anyone. It is suspected that a bad person is feigning death, deceiving, and falsely claiming to be seeking fame. We hope you will investigate and handle this. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Please publish this in your newspaper to clarify the truth." Stamped, Cai Tingkai.</p>
<h3>Organizational Content of the Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>Special Telegram from Dalian: Since the puppet state declared its establishment on March 9, 1932, (August 1933) it has only been slightly more than seventeen months. All political work, during this extremely short period, has been tirelessly managed by the Japanese, and none of it has not been brought under the control of the Japanese. Yet, it still claims to the world that it has no ambition for annexation. Who is it deceiving? The internal situation is revealed as follows, which also shows the Japanese's insidious methods.</p>
<h3>㈠ Political Situation</h3>
<p>㈠ A Vertical Observation: All county magistrates are Manchus, and under the county magistrate are appointed advisory officials, all of whom are Japanese. All political affairs and precedents must pass through the hands of the advisory official and the county magistrate. Formally, the county magistrate presides over everything, and the advisory official assists him. But in reality, it is far from the truth. The advisory official is the backstage boss. Major issues in the county such as public security, industry, finance, and personnel are all presided over by the advisory official. The county magistrate only executes the orders of the advisory official and acts as a mouthpiece. The advisory official is the substantive county magistrate, while the county magistrate is merely a figurehead.</p>
<p>The actual situation in each county is like this. Extending this to the province, the province is also like this. Under the provincial government, there are the General Affairs Bureau, the Tax Supervision Bureau (formerly the Finance Department), the Civil Affairs Department, the Education Department, the Industry Department, and the Police Department. Each department has a director who assists the governor in handling the province's political affairs. But in reality, the province's important political affairs are mostly concentrated in the General Affairs Bureau, and the province's important public security (with armed forces) is under the jurisdiction of the Police Department. And the directors of the General Affairs Bureau and the Police Department are all Japanese. Therefore, the position of governor is practically nominal. All practical measures, personnel advancements and retreats, and financial allocation, etc., are controlled by the Japanese directors of the General Affairs and Police Departments.</p>
<p>Below the directors of each department, there are four or five sections such as the General Affairs Section.</p>
<p>The selection of section chiefs is half Manchu and half Japanese, but the chief of the General Affairs Section is definitely Japanese. In other words, the chief of the General Affairs Section is the substantive director, and the director is just a puppet of the chief of the General Affairs Section. The organization of the provincial governments is generally as described above. The central government is divided into three branches (namely the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the State Council). The Legislative Yuan is currently examining the Japanese constitutional period and has not yet produced any concrete results. The Control Yuan follows the will of the Japanese. Sometimes it exercises the power of supervision. For example, the impeachment of Governor Han of Heilongjiang by the Control Yuan is a manifestation of the Control Yuan performing its duties, but the motivation lies with the Japanese, not with the Manchus. The State Council is the highest administrative organ in the country, divided into the Office of the Chief Secretary and the Office of the Secretary (the Chief Secretary is the Japanese Koma Hidezo, who was rumored to have personally slapped the cheek of Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu). Below it are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Transportation,</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Education. Each ministry is divided into many departments. The heads of each department are half Japanese and half Manchu, but the chief of the General Affairs Department is usually Japanese. The actual power of each ministry's affairs is controlled by the General Affairs Department. The other departments only follow the routine. Therefore, the ministers and vice-ministers of each ministry are mostly nominal.</p>
<p>In short, from a vertical perspective, the politics of the puppet organization, from the counties at the bottom, through the provinces in the middle, and up to the highest State Council, all real power is in the hands of the Japanese. The so-called ministers and vice-ministers of each department, governors of each province, directors of each department, and county magistrates of each county, etc., all have shells but no souls. The Japanese, as chief secretaries, chiefs of general affairs departments, directors of general affairs bureaus, and advisory officials, etc., say east and it's east, say west and it's west, holding all power and being arrogant. Therefore, from a vertical perspective, the politics of the puppet organization can be said to be completely controlled by the Japanese.</p>
<p>㈡ A Horizontal Observation: Seventeen months have passed since the establishment of the puppet state. The</p>
<p>horizontal observation of its political achievements is briefly recorded as follows: ㈠ In terms of diplomacy,</p>
<p>the problems that had been pending in the past, such as mining rights and land lease rights, have been resolved as the Japanese hoped. Formally, human-shaped envoy delegations and girl envoy delegations, etc., exchanged tributes, which was quite lively. On the Mid-Autumn Festival of the first year of Datong (the lunar calendar), Japan was the first country to recognize the puppet state. The Japan-Manchukuo Protocol stipulated that the security of the puppet state would be the responsibility of the friendly country Japan. Japan could freely station troops in the puppet state. The puppet state sent Bao Guancheng as the plenipotentiary ambassador to Japan (now replaced by Ding Shiyuan). Japan specially appointed Honjo Shigeru as the plenipotentiary envoy to the puppet state (later replaced by Muto and Hishikari). In addition to the duties of plenipotentiary envoy, he also concurrently served as the commander of the Kwantung Army and the director-general of the Kwantung Leased Territory, which was even more excessive than Ito Hirobumi in Korea. ㈡ In terms of civil affairs, guidance officials were initially established in each county, and later changed to advisory officials. The advisory officials were of uneven quality. They acted as tyrants in various counties, taking bribes, enslaving county magistrates, disregarding laws and regulations, and treating human life like grass. It is difficult to fully describe their evil deeds. The directors of the General Affairs Bureau and the Police Department in each province, and the chiefs of the General Affairs Section in each department, controlled everything and acted arbitrarily. The puppet officials' measures were reversed, which is also countless. The above are all appointed by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, grasping the actual administration. On the surface, it is still called a paradise for 30 million people in Manchuria, but the inside story is like this. ㈢ In terms of finance, the puppet government borrowed 20 million yuan in Japanese debt for military purposes and to help spring plowing, implementing a public sale and public cultivation of opium, opening a new era of the 20th century. However, the number of civilians without food and shelter in various places accounts for eight or nine tenths of the total. The amount of tax revenue arrears also accounts for six or seven tenths of the proportion. As a result, local schools,</p>
<p>Seven or eight out of ten are closed. Only schools in cities are open, and they cannot maintain the original number of students. The number of students dropping out of school has increased, and the number of unemployed people has increased even more. ㈣ In terms of military affairs, it is trending towards gradual elimination. The number of troops is gradually decreasing (the number of friendly troops is gradually increasing to fulfill their responsibility of maintaining the security of Manchukuo). The number of military equipment is also gradually decreasing. The police are only issued five bullets per night, and they are recovered the next morning. In the future, it may be possible to achieve a state of no soldiers and no guns throughout the country. If the appointment of important military officers, it is necessary to seek the consent of the commander of the Kwantung Army. The Ministry of Military Affairs itself is powerless. ㈤ In terms of judicial affairs, it is generally the same as before (consular jurisdiction). However, the Harmony Associations in each county (a kind of mediation organization) act as agents for people's lawsuits, reversing right and wrong, and causing extreme chaos. The judicial organs are instead desolate and deserted, with no one paying attention. ㈥ In terms of transportation, all railways in Manchukuo are entrusted to the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company for management. Therefore, many of the commercial shares of the Shenhai Railway, which is jointly operated by the government and merchants, have been bought by the Japanese. The Jihui Railway was also completed on schedule to achieve the convenience of reaching Changchun from Qingjin Port. Telegrams, telecommunications, and wireless communications have been operated by the Japanese. Although shares are solicited from the people of the puppet state, few people subscribe. Afterwards, many of them are exchanged with the Japanese. From now on, the electrical business of Manchukuo will be entirely in the hands of the Japanese. In terms of industry, the problems that had been pending in the past, such as mining and commercial leases, etc., are now completely resolved according to the wishes of the Japanese. In addition, matters such as diverting river channels, opening paddy fields, and Korean farmers forcibly renting people's fields to plant rice are all common occurrences. There are also plans to forcibly immigrate (from Japan to Manchuria) 200,000 people near Jingbo Lake and Xingkai Lake. The date of realization should not be far away. In various official offices in the provincial capitals of Xinjing, Fengji, and Heihe, all matters such as construction, banquets, and entertainment are handled by Japanese officials to Japanese firms. The industrial and commercial enterprises run by Manchus sigh with regret and are deserted. ㈧ In terms of education, there are only middle schools and primary schools in cities. Except for Harbin, there are no universities or specialized schools. Among the schools in rural areas, the number of schools that are open is only seven or eight tenths of what it was before the incident. The purpose of education has also become absolutely obedient labor education (in fact, it is slave education).</p>

<p>The intention is to cultivate foolish people who only know how to work and do not consider other things.</p>
<h3>㈡ Railway Business</h3>
<p>In the spring of this year, the puppet government, under the coercion of Japan, entrusted the South Manchuria Railway, which is operated by Japan, to operate all the railways, harbors, waterways, and all ancillary businesses in the Northeast. On February 1, it established the Railway General Bureau. The railways under its jurisdiction include Jichang, Jidun, Jihai, Sitao, Taoang, Qike, Taosuo, Fanhai, Fengshan, Northeast, and river transportation such as Yingkou, Andong, Yalu River, Songhua River, and Huludao, all included. The General Bureau's crude organization is divided into six offices: General Affairs, Management, Transportation, Machinery, Engineering, and Police. The Director-General of the General Bureau is Kanji Usami, and the directors of each office are also all Japanese. There are no Chinese people in the General Bureau. The General Bureau dispatches one Japanese representative to each railway bureau to take full responsibility. The directors of each bureau must act in accordance with the wishes of the representative of this road. The Northeast Railway is completely under the direct management of the Japanese.</p>
<h3>㈢ Mining Problems</h3>
<p>According to the regulations for mining, only Chinese people have the right to obtain mining rights. Foreigners do not have this right. Now, the new regulations of the puppet state are about to be promulgated, and Japanese people can freely mine. The Department of Agriculture and Mining was moved into the courtyard of the Provincial City Negotiation Office in November last year. All mining licenses have been suspended. Metals are especially prohibited because they must wait for the promulgation of the new regulations and give special privileges to the Japanese. Xu Shaoqing, the director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, is only a nominal director. The chief of the General Affairs Section, Shengba, is the Supreme Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining. The chief of the Mining Section is Yamane. This section is controlled by the Japanese and can obtain special benefits.</p>
<h3>㈣ Postal Situation</h3>
<p>The current income of the post office of the puppet organization is barely enough to cover expenses. There are a total of six hundred and</p>
<p>Sixty people. Japanese people occupy 150 important positions. The people with the highest authority are the Japanese inspectors. Nakamura Kutsubo (the original receiver) in diplomacy, Katsuto Tokura (in charge of promotion, demotion, and dismissal of personnel) in personnel, and Daiyu, the Japanese director of the Secretariat, which is divided into four sections. The section chiefs of the three sections are all Japanese. Kanro Tanaka, the director of the Accounting Office, which is divided into two sections. Both the affairs and accounting are Japanese. The director of the Patrol Office, Nakamura, concurrently manages the main and outer cities and the branches of each county. The director of the General Inspection Office is Kotobuki Yoshimura (in the Bureau). The director of the Stationery Office is Japanese. The director of the Business Office is Qian Zaosheng. Among the staff in the post office, Japanese people and Chinese people do the same work, but Chinese people only get half the salary of Japanese people.</p>
<h3>㈤ Banking Situation</h3>
<p>Since Japan occupied the Northeast, it first confiscated the provincial banks, controlled the economy and finance. Now, the three provincial banks of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang in the Northeast have been merged into one puppet Manchukuo National Central Bank. Rong Hou (also known as Shuzhang, the former director of finance of Jilin) is the nominal president. In fact, all major financial issues are exclusively controlled by Vice President Mitsunari Kyuroku, Business Manager Kazuo Chio, and Industrial Manager Igarashi. The head office of the puppet Manchukuo Central Bank is in Changchun, with a total of 200 employees, of whom 170 are Japanese. Japanese people not only occupy important positions, but even lower-level employees are Japanese, but the salaries are very good. Japanese guards earn 120 yuan per month, and tea servants earn 80 yuan per month. However, after the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo Central Bank, 5,000 Chinese people were laid off (including the former Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provincial banks and the number of people who were laid off from affiliated businesses).</p>
<h3>㈥ Electrical Business</h3>
<p>All telegraphs, telephones, wireless telegraphs, wireless telephones, wireless broadcasting, and other electrical businesses in the four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe were forced by the Japanese on March 26 to establish a Manchukuo-Japan joint communication company agreement, and a Manchuria Telegraph and Telephone Co., Ltd. was established to control and seize them. Its name is a company organization, and the capital is set at 50 million Japanese yen. The value of all electrical communication businesses in the four northeastern provinces (referred to as the scope of the puppet state) (i.e., wired and wireless telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, etc. in the four northeastern provinces) is 6 million Japanese yen, which is 120,000 shares, with each share worth 50 yen. The value of the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Area is 16.5 million Japanese yen, which is 330,000 shares. The total is 1 million shares. In addition to the above-mentioned 450,000 shares, they are publicly raised by the governments and public organizations of the puppet Manchukuo and Japan. No oppressed Chinese people invest in the shares. Only a few people who consider themselves to be Manchurians invest in the shares. In short, the electrical business of the Northeast has been given to the Japanese by the puppet Manchukuo.</p>
<h3>㈦ Social Darkness</h3>
<p>Northeastern society is filled with gloomy, dark, terrifying, poor, and corrupt phenomena. Opium dens are everywhere, gambling houses are set up everywhere (all opened by Japanese people), and female escorts and prostitutes are everywhere. People who have disputes due to debt or land are all handled by Japanese courts. Japanese people enforce things forcefully, which is more effective than the legal judgments of the courts. The lives and property of people with a little wealth are often in danger, because Japanese thugs often extort money and then falsely accuse them of being anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese and secretly communicating with the Volunteer Army. Beggars are everywhere on the streets. If one person gives money to a beggar, the beggars will swarm around and be unable to escape for half a day. Residents and shops are robbed every day. People's habits and hobbies are either smoking opium or gambling, and drinking and prostitution are secondary. All kinds of evil phenomena in society are rarely seen in the world. This is the manifestation of the puppet state's paradise on earth.</p>
<h3>㈧ Strange Education</h3>
<p>The puppet state's Ministry of Education, under the order of the Japanese, did not allow enrollment in the autumn. Therefore, thousands of graduates of fake primary schools and middle schools (calculated as one place in Liaoning Province) have no schools to enter and have all dropped out of school. If the class taught by the teacher has graduated, they will be unemployed. Many teachers in various schools have been squeezed out and unemployed. When school started in the spring, the Japanese supervisors of each school ordered the teachers and staff of each school to wipe the glass and scrub the floor. The 60-year-old principal of the Women's Normal School was ordered by the Japanese supervisor to take off his leather robe and scrub the floor when it was cold, which is also tragic for the educated intellectuals in the education sector to receive such slave treatment. Today, the Education Bureau of Shenyang County is recruiting 50 rural teachers (with a monthly salary of more than 20 yuan), and more than 600 people have applied for the exam. All of them have graduated from the new normal school, the old normal school, and the Northeast University preparatory course. In the future, the number of dropouts and unemployed people in the Northeast education sector will inevitably increase day by day, because the Japanese are doing their best to exclude intellectuals.</p>
<h3>㈨ Many Unemployed</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the puppet state, the Japanese ordered the use of tariff barrier policies, and agricultural products could not be transported out, resulting in low prices for agricultural products. The heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes borne by farmers were also very heavy. Small and medium-sized farmers went bankrupt one after another. The strong became bandits, and the weak starved to death. Then, wealthy farmers could not support themselves. The rural economy was destroyed, and most farmers were unable to cultivate the land and were all unemployed. Due to the impact of tariffs, all merchants who sold Western and Chinese goods closed down one after another. Sellers of Japanese goods also closed down and became unemployed because the Japanese had directly operated them. Even shops that were not closed were also becoming increasingly depleted. Merchants had jobs but no salary, which was also equivalent to being unemployed. Due to the invasion of Japanese industry and political oppression, industry has no possibility of development. Because too many Japanese people come to the Northeast, all laborers with wages above one yuan are done by Japanese people, and laborers with wages above five cents are done by Koreans. Chinese people can only get the lowest-paid jobs. The difficulty of survival for Chinese people in agriculture, commerce, industry, and education in the Northeast is unimaginable to the world.</p>
<h3>㈩ Public Sale of Opium</h3>
<p>The Japanese in the Northeast use opium, a poisonous substance, as the only source of income. It weakens the race and is a product of profit. Wherever the power of the puppet state reaches, it is fully promoted, and the cultivation, transportation, and sale of opium are encouraged. Taking Liaoning Province as an example, there are already 40 opium retail outlets established under the instructions of the Fengtian Provincial Government of the puppet state. Each outlet pays a deposit of 500 yuan to the Fengtian Provincial Government when applying for a permit. Including the Japanese people's bribery and campaign expenses, a license for an opium retail outlet costs 5,000 yuan in cash. Each outlet can sell an average of 200 yuan per day. Each serving of opium sold retail costs two or four corners. In the city of Fengtian, there are more than 20,000 people smoking opium in these publicly sold opium places, and there are still many people selling and smoking privately. Is the future of the Northeast nation still worth imagining? Not only that, but all raw opium materials produced in the Northeast must be purchased by the opium public sale offices set up by the Manchukuo, transported to Dalian, and transformed by the Japanese opium transformation institutions before being resold to smokers. The materials added are probably able to make it difficult for opium smokers to quit. Its cruelty and viciousness are frightening.</p>
<h3>Major Battle to Break Out in Eastern Jilin</h3>
<p>Three routes of the East China Army advance westward along the Suifen River line, sending personnel to various countries to purchase large quantities of military supplies.</p>
<p>Harbin Special Dispatch: Recently, in order to save the military progress and expand its territory, the Republic of East China has actively strengthened the military training and combat skills of the Volunteer Army that it has incorporated, and prepared military equipment. In addition to the more than 30,000 guns that were confiscated from the Han and Liang brigades in the Sino-Russian War and the guns that were confiscated from the troops of Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, Li Du, and Wang Delin when they retreated to Russia, which were returned, they are now secretly sending people to other countries to purchase large quantities of military supplies to complete the plan of five divisions this year. The Japanese and puppet troops are quite panicked about this preparation of the Republic of East China. The Japanese Kwantung Army is now actively dispatching troops to defend, but due to the uprising of Volunteer Armies everywhere, it is actually suffering from the trouble of taking care of one thing and losing another. It is also heard that the East China Army has now completed two divisions, with a population of about 80,000, and is advancing westward along the Suifen River line and the Da Suifen River area in three routes. Although it has not yet made contact with the Japanese and puppet troops, its strength is quite strong. Recently, a major battle will break out in the eastern Jilin area.</p>

<h3>Director of the PingSui Railway Bureau Denies PingSui Loan</h3>
<p>There are also rumors of selling the Longyan Coal Mine in Pingfang, which is taken seriously by all parties and awaits factual evidence.</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The rumors about the PingSui Railway taking out a large loan have been circulating for days. How is the truth? It remains to be seen whether the facts will prove it in the future. According to Shen Chang, the Director of the PingSui Railway Bureau, when talking to reporters, the rumor that the PingSui Railway is taking out a loan of 7 million is not true. In recent years, the PingSui Railway has been severely damaged, and it is necessary to raise a huge debt to actively reorganize it. However, the rumors are not true. The last time the PingSui Railway was interrupted, due to reduced income, it was impossible to support it. It borrowed 400,000 from the banking industry in Pingjin to meet the emergency needs. Later, Datong Coal Industry Company entrusted the railway to transport coal and purchased additional vehicles, and borrowed more than 400,000, for a total of more than 800,000 yuan. This is the fact, or it may have caused outside rumors. I have already drafted a plan for the restoration of the PingSui Railway, which requires approximately more than 2 million in labor and material costs. In the future, when it is implemented, materials can be purchased on credit without the need to borrow money from the banking industry. It has not been implemented yet in the slack season, and as soon as the income is slightly secured, the restoration plan and reorganization debt, etc., can be started in order, etc.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors in Pingfang that the authorities will sell the Longyan Coal Mine on the PingSui Line to Japan, saying that this matter is being carried out in Ping by a certain minister of the Central Government, and the minister has also personally gone to the mine to inspect it. The negotiations have been largely completed. All parties believe that since the Japanese army has penetrated deeply, the PingSui Line is an important place for national defense and cannot be easily allowed to let foreign forces extend into it. They are paying close attention to this matter. The coal and iron ore deposits in the mine are extremely rich. The company has been established for a long time, but it has not yet been mined. If it is sold to Japan now, it is not only beneficial to the enemy, but it also has a great impact on national defense. Since the armistice, many Japanese military intelligence officers and spies have gone to the Nankou Qinglong Bridge area to spy on the situation, and their intentions are unpredictable. In case there are any problems on the PingSui Line in the future, not only will Chahar and Suiyuan be in danger, but North China will also have no barrier, and the relationship is extremely important, etc. However, whether or not there is such a thing remains to be seen whether the facts are</p>

<h3>Chahar Province's Miscellaneous Troops are Reorganized One After Another</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan Goes to Zhangbei Again to Inspect, Fang Zhenwu Hopes to Continue to Command Troops, Ji's Troops are Being Surrounded and Attacked by Chahar-Suiyuan Troops</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The reorganization of the Chahar miscellaneous troops is already in order. The newly appointed division, brigade, garrison commander, and guerrilla commander have all telegraphed to take office, and their troops are starting to reorganize in designated locations. The 25th Cavalry Brigade of Liu Zhendong has been reorganized and stationed in Xuanhua. The old troops of Deng Wen are led by Tan Zixin and reorganized into the 10th Cavalry Division, stationed in Yanqing. Li Zhongyi's troops were reorganized into the 24th Cavalry Brigade and stationed in Huailai. Except for Fang Ji, the remaining miscellaneous troops outside the mouth of the pass are only Liu Guitang, Ling Xuanwu, Zhang Yunrong, and Zhang Renjie. Liu Guitang's troops were organized into the Chahar East Guerrilla Army, with a total of three regiments. Liu has sent a representative to Zhangyuan to negotiate with Song and has been properly arranged. He will send personnel to check and reorganize. Ruan Xuanwu took in the remnants of Fang Zhenwu and organized them into two regiments, stationed in Zhangbei. Zhang Yunrong took in Feng's troops and also organized two regiments. After the inspection and organization, they were stationed in Shangdu.</p>
<p>Fang Zhenwu did not want to leave the army and asked to be given the title of Chahar East Border Defense Supervisor, commanding three divisions and taking on the responsibility of national defense. The authorities insisted that he leave the army. What he asked for was extravagant and difficult to allow. However, Fang's qualifications were relatively old and he had no color, so there was a little room for tolerance towards him, allowing him to realize it himself. Fang has now arrived in Dushikou and has established contact with Liu Guitang's troops. His troops only have more than 1,000 people left. His strength is weak and he lacks food and equipment, making it difficult to maintain for a long time. There are radical elements in Ji Hongchang's troops. The Central Government has the intention to eliminate the troubles forever, and there is also an old feud between Ji and Song, making it difficult to tolerate each other. Since Ji went to take risks, Song immediately sent troops to pursue him and telegraphed to the Jin and Suiyuan armies to encircle and suppress him to prevent him from fleeing and causing harm to the local area. On Ji's side, ambition is inevitable. However, because Chahar Province is barren and the people are poor, it is impossible to survive. He plans to go to Suiyuan to open up a new route. When he left to the north, he asked someone to express to Song that he was determined to leave Chahar and hoped that he would not be forced too hastily. Although outsiders say that only more than 1,000 troops were taken away, the actual number is more than this. After Ji left Zhangbei, he led his troops to the Daqing area and advanced towards the Sui border. Chahar and Suiyuan provinces are now dispatching troops to block him. Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry brigades 13 and 2 have been opened near Shangdu to prevent him from fleeing west. However, the northwest of Shangdu is vast and sparsely populated, either with overlapping mountains or endless plains, making it difficult to block him.</p>
<p>After the fall of Duolun, the puppet army's Li Shouxin did not invade westward. Baochang and Kangbao are still safe. The authorities plan to use diplomatic methods to make the puppet army give way. It is uncertain whether the goal can be achieved. Tang Yulin's troops in Guyuan are colluding with the puppet state on the one hand and sending personnel to request reorganization on the other. Tang's Chief of Staff Wang Hongru has now arrived in Beiping from Zhangyuan and is active. In order to appease the people, the authorities are temporarily taking a Huairou approach to Tang. If Tang has a heart to submit, he will also be given a corresponding title to show his control.</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan's troops have a total of four divisions. Feng Zhian's division has already entered Chahar. Now Liu Ruming's and Zhao Dengyu's divisions have also been arriving in Chahar Province one after another. Only Zhang Zizhong's division has not yet moved. It will also be opened soon. Song's troops entering Chahar are gradually advancing towards the mouth of the pass to strengthen border defense. Song Zheyuan himself is going to Zhangbei again to inspect for the sake of organizing the reorganization of Zhang and Ruan's reorganized troops and arranging border defense. He will stay there for a short time. After everything is completed, he will return to Zhang to sit in town. (Arrived on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Anhui Troops Retreat to Henan Border</h3>
<p>Henan-Anhui Forces Jointly Suppress Bandits, Suffering Heavy Losses and Fleeing to the Baima Yi Border in Luyi County</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Remnant troops from Henan Province, under the command of Cheng Yaode, Fan Ba, and others, infiltrated the Fuyang County area in northern Anhui last month, turning into bandits. They colluded with local long-time bandits such as Zhang Xueliang, Li Sanpang, and Yang Xiaohei to commit atrocities. Reports indicated that the Third Army Commander Wang Jun was specifically ordered by telegram to station in Zhengyang to oversee the suppression. All bandit suppression forces in Henan, including Cheng Ziyi's troops, the 45th Division under Dai Minquan, the 14th Cavalry Brigade under Zhang Zhankui, as well as the First and Second Regiments of the Anhui Provincial Security Corps, were placed under his command and dispatched to completely eliminate the bandits as quickly as possible. After receiving orders, Wang Jun immediately moved from Lu'an to Zhengyang to command the forces in tracking down and suppressing the bandits. The bandits were repeatedly defeated in joint attacks by the main forces, initially fleeing to the Dahe County area north of Fuyang. However, due to the relentless pursuit by the suppression forces, they turned towards the Wo Meng area, attempting to cause disturbance. Upon reaching the Hui River, they were met with fierce resistance from the army and local militias. Unable to cross the river, the bandits retreated north, fleeing to Gucheng in the Haozhou area. They were intercepted by the 14th Cavalry Brigade under Zhang Zhankui, and the bandits fled westward, currently retreating to the Baima Yi Shuangmiao area on the border between Henan and Anhui (between Taihe and Luyi counties). The Henan and Anhui forces seized a large number of spoils along the way during this pursuit, rescuing countless men and women held as hostages. It is reported that there are still about three thousand remnant troops and bandits who have fled to the Henan border. There are no traces of the remnant troops in northern Anhui anymore. The bandit suppression forces are still in pursuit. Wang Jun, considering that there was no longer a need to be stationed in Zhengyang, and for the convenience of command, specifically moved to Bengbu yesterday and established the Third Army Headquarters at Zhang's residence to comprehensively coordinate the suppression efforts.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Main Culprit in the Mat Case Recovers from Injuries and is Sent for Investigation. The case of Xi Weiquan and his wife, chairpersons of the Yongda Rice Mill in Huayang Bridge, being shot and killed by bandits, was previously investigated by Yang Shijie, the detective captain of the Public Security Bureau, who apprehended a suspect named Xu Guanxiang. Clues were discovered that the deceased's younger brother, Weisheng, and concubine, Song Xiaomei, were highly suspected. They were also arrested by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the prosecutor's office for interrogation. Later, Detective Captain Yang Shijie obtained information in Xujia Bridge in this county and captured another main culprit in the case, Shen Ahe. He escaped during the arrest and was shot in the leg, causing inflammation. After receiving treatment at Songjiang Hospital and recovering, he was brought back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The suspect confessed frankly and readily, admitting the crime without hesitation. A confession statement was recorded and submitted to the prosecutor's office for joint investigation. It is reported that Inspector Fei Gongxia of the Water Patrol Team arrested Wu Zixiang, who was also involved in the case, and will also be sent to the court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>False Accusation of a Good Person Leading to Non-Capital Punishment and Death. Li Shouqi, a farmer from Cao Wang Temple in this county, exchanged an ox at the Tianfu Temple in Kunshan on the 26th of last month and led it back. In the evening, while passing through Waigang, Xu Amao, a local rogue, intended to extort money. He pretended to advise Li to stay overnight in his teahouse and falsely accused Li of theft. He secretly reported to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau of the town. Jin Jishan, the director of the bureau, immediately ordered the police to bring both the person and the ox to the bureau. After arriving at the bureau, Li stated the truth and requested release. Jin did not investigate and abused non-capital punishment, tying Li's hands behind his back and forcing him to kneel on broken bricks and stones. He whipped Li's entire body with rattan and brutally beat his ribs with iron rods, causing the skin to break and the flesh to split. He was then detained until noon on the 28th, when both the person and the ox were sent to the County Public Security Bureau and transferred to the county. After the county government verified the injuries, they ordered an investigation, and Li was released. Previously, Li had suffered a mental illness due to business failure and the drowning of his second son. This time, he suffered a major shock, and his mental state became abnormal again. The day after his release, his cousin, Qinshan, accompanied him to Kunshan for treatment. The doctor believed there was no hope of recovery. Li suddenly disappeared and was found dead near Kunshan Railway Station on the 31st. During the examination by the Kunshan County Government, his wife, Yu, stated that Li was a peaceful and law-abiding citizen. This time, he suffered cruel abuse, resulting in his death. Although he did not die on the spot, it was indeed due to his injuries. Jin Jishan, as a public official, abused his power and extorted a confession through non-capital punishment, leading to the death of a person. Xu Amao's false accusation of theft and attempt to defraud were all violations of criminal law. She requested the county to order their arrest and punishment and tearfully appealed to all sectors for assistance. The county government is also conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Chongming</h3>
<p>Residents of Sijiao Mountain Accuse the Police Guard Team Leader. Lü Xuchu, the deputy commander of the Sijiao Mountain Self-Defense Force in Chongming County outside the Wusong Sanjia Water Area, and Xu Dounan, the branch commander, and Shi Yutong, the captain of the First Squadron of the Fourth Water Police District, were accused by the residents of Sijiao Mountain in a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. They accused the three officials of colluding for personal gain, acting arbitrarily, harming local people, taking bribes to release major thieves, and extorting money from the islanders, totaling ten major crimes. They requested the dispatch of personnel to Sijiao to conduct a thorough investigation in order to dismiss them. The Department of Civil Affairs entrusted Shen, the County Magistrate of Chongming, to investigate and reply. County Magistrate Shen then appointed Captain Wang of the Sixteenth Squadron of the Fourth Water Police District and Captain Gong of the Seventeenth Squadron as investigators. After the two officials arrived at Sijiao, they set up a case in the headquarters of the Self-Defense Force to conduct trials and interrogation, and dispatched four armed water police to guard. They also ordered four members of the Self-Defense Force to stand duty, with Li Junfu, the secretary of the Self-Defense Force, sitting on the right as a recorder, recording the testimony. After the interrogation was completed, the two commissioners Wang and Gong ordered the detention of the witness Jin Yongyou. After Li Junfu interceded, he was released on bail. Then they ordered the witnesses Shi Linlai, Qiu Along, Guo Linji, etc. to sign a guarantee and write a statement denying the original accusation, which aroused public outrage. The islanders elected Qiu Shao as their representative and submitted petitions to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Chongming County Government, requesting the revocation of the coerced guarantee and the coerced statement in order to prevent deception and earnestly requesting a joint dispatch of appropriate commissioners to thoroughly investigate and handle the case.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Flag Station Relocation Issue. Representatives of the Jingxi Road Construction Committee, such as Yang Xingruo, previously requested the First District Office to forward a request to the county government to have the flag station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway in this county relocated westward to the vicinity of Jingxi Road, citing the inconvenient location for travelers and the potential for business development. However, merchants such as Huang Hongdao suddenly submitted a petition to the Railway Bureau opposing the relocation. After the Railway Bureau sent personnel to Wuxi twice for inspection, the county government and all parties opposing the station relocation received a reply from the Railway Bureau yesterday stating that the flag station was suitably located, prepared for future expansion, and should not be relocated westward. Furthermore, the business after the relocation would only be a subdivision of the Wuxi station. Therefore, it was decided that the station did not need to be relocated. The two-month-long dispute over the station relocation has now come to an end.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Continued News on Female Student Jumping into the River. It has now been confirmed that Fan Xiu, the female student who committed suicide by jumping into the river on the Dayu Steamer, was indeed from Fujian University and studying at Nantong Women's Normal School. She was the niece of Lu Feizhi, the former professor of Nantong Agricultural University. When the girl was twelve years old, she came to Nantong and was fostered in her uncle's home. Lu also provided funds for her to study at the Women's Normal School. She was also betrothed to the nephew of Wang Bunjun, the director of the Provincial Langshan Cotton Mill. She is not yet married. However, the reason for her jumping into the river is still unclear. As for Mao Mengjue, who was traveling with the girl, he is the nephew of Mao Maoyou and not an employee of the 18th Army factory.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Six Families Robbed in Succession by Bandits</p>
<p>In the Zhujia Dun area of Wangjiangjing, Jiaxing, there are only eight households, all of whom live by silk weaving. At around 10 pm the night before, more than a dozen bandits speaking with a Shaoxing accent suddenly arrived on five stolen boats, sailing from the Liansi Dang. After landing, they robbed six households: Zhang Ajin, Zhang Azhao, Zhang Liujin, Zhang Sifang, Zhang Ashun, and Yao Wenlong. The losses were not small. All the victims have reported the case to the Third District Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Detailed Account of Losses from the Huhu Bus Robbery</h3>
<p>The robbery of the Huhu Bus at the Yujia Hui Chijia Bangkou has already been reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>It is now known that the ship was the Hengji, a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company vessel. It has been sailing the Huhu route and never encountered any danger. The greatest losses were in the purser's office. After investigation, the total loss was more than 3,000 yuan. This does not include clothing and ornaments. There were also two tugboats belonging to the tugboat company. The company has reported to the two provinces' land and water military and police authorities to conduct a strict search to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Occurs in Yangjia Lou</h3>
<p>A shocking case of a sister beating her younger brother to death occurred in Yangjia Lou, Xitang, this county, causing a sensation. It is now known that the deceased, Yao Guanfu, was penniless, 37 years old, and had no one to rely on. His sister, Xu Yao, was old and weak, her husband had died early, and her children were young. She invited her younger brother to live with her to manage the fields, and she hired two farmhands, Xu Adi and Xiaodi, both of whom were directed by Guanfu to work. Unexpectedly, yesterday, Xu Yao had a dispute with Xu Aba, a farmhand who had already quit, over a debt relationship. Guanfu, out of family affection, advised his sister not to be too concerned. This angered his sister, and the two began to fight. Xu Yao was struck in the face by her brother, and blood flowed all over her body. She reported the incident to the branch security bureau. Xu Aba and Xiaodi, the two farmhands, heard about the incident and were outraged. They rushed from the fields and beat Guanfu severely, leaving numerous scars on his left forehead. His waist and abdomen were also severely injured. He died immediately. The two farmhands saw that they had caused a disaster and fled. The neighbors reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, and his sister was taken into custody for questioning and then sent to court for legal action. Shou Yao, the director of the Public Security Bureau, went to the countryside to investigate.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Large Group of Beggars from Tianliu Arrive in Yangzhou. On the afternoon of the 3rd, 42 beggars who had fled from Tianliu arrived at the Phoenix Bridge Town, about five miles outside the North Gate of the city. They were in groups of three to five, begging for money and food from door to door. The police chief and the deputy of the township in charge came forward to maintain order, and that evening they were led out of the area.</p>
<h3>Another Dispute Occurs in the County Farmers' Association</h3>
<p>The County Executive Committee, based on the report by Song Zhifu and others, the directors of the Farmers' Associations of Sanwenhe and other townships in the Second Autonomous Region, accused Shi Jun, the director of the County Farmers' Association, of concurrently holding other positions remotely, neglecting his work, and requested that he be punished. The matter was raised for discussion at the 138th Committee meeting, which decided: (1) The position of Director Shi will be temporarily filled by the Deputy Director Zhou Lu; (2) Whether the director of the County Farmers' Association can concurrently hold administrative work in other counties and still hold his position remotely should be reported to the province for clarification. Zhou has now arrived at the association to continue his work and has sent letters to various agencies and organizations to inform them. Shi has submitted a report to the County Party Department, stating that the position of director of the Farmers' Association is an honorary position, as stated in Article 23 of the Farmers' Association Law. He requested a leave of absence for two months, as he was traveling abroad. On June 28th, he submitted his resignation at the seventh directors' meeting. The resignation was deemed not to comply with the regulations and was changed to a request for leave. The duties were delegated to the Deputy Director, and the documents and seals were still kept by the First Section. All of this was recorded. This time, Inspector Pan Taisheng did not consult the files during his investigation and directly raised the issue at the meeting, directly punishing the association with an order, which does not seem to be based on any legal basis. In addition to reporting to the Provincial Party Department and the relevant authorities, he has also submitted the original instruction of the County Executive Committee and requested a review.</p>
<h3>The Flood Water Level Rises Again in the Canal</h3>
<p>According to reports from the Canal Construction Bureau, the water level in northern Jiangsu has risen again for consecutive days. The water level at the Wan Zhulou Dam rose by 1.7 feet on the 2nd, and the water level at the Bulao River rose by 1.4 feet. On the 3rd, the water level at the Jiang Zhulou Dam continued to rise by 1.4 feet, with a current water level of 12 feet. The water level at the Bulao River continued to rise by 1.4 feet, with a current water level of 6.8 feet. The water level at the Qingjiang Main Gate rose by 5 inches on the 4th, with a current water level of 22.3 feet. Fortunately, the Luo River has receded, but the water level in the canal has risen by 4 meters. Once the water flows into the canal, another flood disaster in northern Jiangsu may be unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Thorough Investigation of the Red Pills Case on the Chuanshan Steamer. The Anti-Japanese Association of Shipu, Xiangshan, reported on the 24th of last month, based on a report by the people Gong Amu and Xu Xiaohuo, that 170 large bags of red pills and ten dozen morphine ampules were found in the line room of the Chuanshan Steamer, packed in longan boxes. The boxes were all labeled with "Shipu transfer to Dingtai Store for collection". The association sent people to search and seize the items, and then transferred them to the county government for investigation. The county government's investigation revealed that the main culprit was Ling from Donglai Town, Shipu. The actual number of red pill bags transported was 270. The missing 100 bags are suspected to have been divided by the reporters Gong Amu, Xu Xiaohuo, and the Anti-Japanese Association inspectors Su Chubing and Wu Hequi. The county government has summoned the Chinese residents of various districts for strict legal action.</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Dr. Lu Zhong'an Called to Diagnose Chronic Asthma, Visits Lin Huanting's Residence in the Afternoon, Returns to Beijing Within Days</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing at 7:30 yesterday morning. This trip was specifically for medical treatment, with a very simple entourage. He is scheduled to rest in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Beijing. The North Station was under guard by the City Security Team and the City Public Security Bureau in advance. Lin alighted from the train amidst military music and transferred to a car belonging to Yang Hu, the director of the Security Office, to return to his private residence on Rue Cardinal Fesch. Those who greeted him at the station included Yang Hu, Yu Hongjun representing the Mayor, and Wen Hongen, the director of the City Public Security Bureau, among others. Lin wore a blue shirt, a black mandarin jacket, and carried a small suitcase, traveling very simply. Although suffering from asthma, his spirits were good. Shortly after arriving at his residence, Wen Hongen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Jin Liren, the director of the Land Bureau, paid their respects, but left after a brief visit. At around 9:00, Dr. Lu Zhong'an, a national physician, was summoned to his residence for diagnosis. Lin hired a car and went out at 10:45 in the morning, returning to his residence at 1:00 in the afternoon. After lunch, at 3:00, he and his nephew went out again in a car borrowed from Mayor Wu, first to Lin Huanting's residence on Yuyuan Road to express condolences, and then to Zhaofeng Park. He returned to his residence at 4:40. When reporters asked Lin when he would return to Beijing, he replied that it was undecided. At that time, Yu Hongjun, the secretary-general of the municipal government, and Guo Shen, a former advisor, visited Lin and went inside together, leaving after talking for half an hour. Later, reporters interviewed Dr. Lu Zhong'an, who said that Lin had been suffering from asthma for several years, and it always flared up in winter. For the past two years, he had been treating Lin and preparing a medicinal paste for him to take to Beijing. Fortunately, it did not recur. Therefore, this trip was entirely for medical reasons and had no other special purpose. He did not know when Chairman Lin would return to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Taibao Gentry Meeting After Sea Dike Incident</h3>
<p>Elect Representatives to Go to the Province to Request Funds for Repair, Zhang Gongquan and Others Send Telegrams to the Government and the Executive Yuan to Appeal</p>
<p>After the sea dikes in Baoshan and Liuhe successively ran into trouble, the gentry of the two counties, recognizing the extremely critical situation and the large amount of funds needed for repairs, not only hired laborers to plug the breaches but also sent telegrams to the provincial authorities to report the emergency. Yesterday, the gentry of the two counties met in Shanghai to discuss follow-up measures. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Gentry from Both Counties</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) at 2 pm, representatives from the public groups and local gentry of Baoshan and Taicang counties held an emergency meeting at Shiji Road. Those present included Jin Qingzhang, the County Magistrate of Baoshan; She Yingduo, the section chief; Zhang Gongquan and Xu Jizhong, gentry; Hong Xiaosi, the County Magistrate of Taicang; Tang Wenzhi, Zhu Kaichou, and Hong Jingnian, gentry. It was decided that the two counties would jointly elect representatives to go to the province to visit Chairman Gu, Finance Director Shu, and Construction Director Dong to request a large sum of money for repairs. The representatives include Hong Jingnian, Jiang Yuren, Qian Chunyi, and Wu Sansheng from Taicang; and Shi Wenran and Pan Mengqiao from Baoshan. They will depart for the province soon. Tang Wenzhi, Zhang Gongquan, and other gentry from the two counties will send telegrams to the National Government and the Executive Yuan to appeal for relief.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Forms Temporary Disaster Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Since the sea dike incident, the Baoshan County Government has convened various agencies to discuss emergency measures and formed a temporary disaster relief committee, which has been reported to the provincial government for record. The original telegram reads: "Gu, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, and Dong, the Director of Construction. Today, the wind and tide are still strong, and the sea dike has been breached in several places, which is extremely critical. The county has convened various agencies to discuss emergency relief measures and decided to form a temporary disaster relief committee to implement disaster relief work. The required expenses will be covered by the temporary disaster prevention project funds allocated by the province and reported to the province for record. In this urgent situation, we will proceed accordingly and report by telegram first. Jin Qingzhang, County Magistrate of Baoshan."</p>
<h3>Provincial Order to County Government to Supervise and Prevent</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County Government received a telegram from the Provincial Department of Construction yesterday, which read: "Baoshan County Magistrate Jin, both telegrams received. The typhoon has passed through Shanghai, and the dike damage in the county is quite severe. In addition to sending Construction Department technician Zhang Junsheng to conduct an immediate inspection, you must continue to supervise and prevent any negligence. Sincerely, Chairman Gu, Director Dong."</p>
<h3>Fortuitous Wind Change After Dike Breach Averts Catastrophe</h3>
<p>When the previous typhoon passed through, the Songhu area was not within the hurricane's center range, but the coastal dikes in Taibao counties suffered severe damage. The Xuejia Tan and Xiaosabei sections of Baoshan, as well as the Wangjia Zhai and Wangjia Wharf areas of Liuhe, were all breached. Fortunately, the wind changed after the dike breach, averting a catastrophe. The sea dikes of the two counties cause the tide to surge when encountering a northeast wind and fall rapidly when encountering a northwest wind. After the sea dike was damaged the other day, the wind direction immediately changed from northeast to northwest, preventing the tide from flowing back in. It was as if divine assistance was given. Otherwise, the Shanghai area would have been unimaginable. The dikes in Liuhe are still being repaired. In Baoshan, Bao Siren, the secretary of the county government, and Bao Liping, the dike patrol officer, are patrolling and guarding strictly.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce urgently telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, requesting urgent repairs to the Wusong Sea Dike. The original text is recorded below: "Gu, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang. On the 5th of this month, according to a letter from our Wusong branch office, the Wusong Sea Dike had been bombed into countless large holes in the Outer Ma Road area after the January 28th Incident last year. Our office had appealed for repairs, but no construction has been carried out. On the evening of yesterday's strong wind and rain, the river tide surged, and the huge waves shook the already damaged dike, causing it to collapse in five or six places over a length of dozens of feet. The foot of the mud dike to the north was also eroded, putting it in a precarious position. Although the tide has now passed, if repairs are not urgently carried out, there is a danger of breaches and destruction during the upcoming autumn floods, which would submerge the entire town. We have investigated the cause of the dangerous dike project and request that funds be urgently allocated for repairs. We jointly sent two telegrams to your government with the local associations, which have been filed. We hereby report the situation again and request a prompt review and action. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>North and South Concession Telephone Permits to Be Removed by Deadline</h3>
<p>According to the provisions of the temporary contract, local newspapers recently reported that the Shanghai Telephone Administration has set a deadline for the removal of telephones of the North and South District crossing the boundary. The reporter inquired with the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and was informed that the telephone companies in the concession have been installing telephones in the South City, Zhabei, and Pudong for a long time. In order to maintain sovereignty and interests, they should be recovered as soon as possible. Therefore, in the temporary contract signed by the Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Administration of the Ministry of Communications with the Shanghai Telephone Company in April of this year, it was clearly stipulated that once the Telephone Administration notifies the company to remove these telephones, the company should do so within 30 days after receiving the notice and should not demand any compensation for losses. Now, according to the provisions of the contract, the Shanghai Telephone Administration of the Ministry of Communications has decided to recover the concession telephones in the South City and Zhabei before September 30. However, government agencies that need to continue using these telephones for official convenience will be subject to separate regulations so that the Telephone Administration has jurisdiction. As for Pudong, the work will begin after the establishment of a branch office. This recovery is entirely based on the contract and there is no problem.</p>
<h3>Submarine Cables Gradually Restored</h3>
<p>The submarine cables were damaged due to the typhoon, but the repair work is progressing very quickly. Submarine telegraph communication between Shanghai and Hong Kong was restored yesterday morning. Except for telegrams to Japan, which are still being relayed, all international telegrams transmitted by the lines of various submarine cable companies can be normally transmitted without any obstruction. It is reported that the Great Northern Telegraph Company's line to Japan will be restored to its original state soon.</p>
<h3>Yan Qingxiang, Representative of Labor and Capital Attending National Labor Conference, Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

Upon arriving at the port, more than 50 members of the China Industrial Federation went to the pier to welcome him.

<h3>Sun Tonggang Will Fly to Shanghai Today</h3>

The municipal government received a telegram from Sun yesterday, stating that he is scheduled to fly from Beijing to Shanghai this morning and is expected to arrive at Hongqiao Airport at about 12:00 noon. After receiving the telegram, the municipal government ordered the Municipal Security Office and the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police and security teams to be on guard and responsible for protection. Lin Wojiang, the secretary-general of the Aviation Association, and various groups have been actively preparing for the welcoming ceremony. A grand welcoming ceremony will be held after Sun arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Prior Arrangements</h3>
<p>After the meeting, City Government Representative Li Dachao told reporters that eighteen new aircraft will arrive in Shanghai simultaneously on the morning of the 9th. If the weather is good that day, the Aviation Administration plans to send more aircraft, with a total of more than twenty. After arriving in Shanghai, they will first fly around the city area once before landing at Hongqiao Airport. Preparations have been discussed and agreed upon. However, many people are expected to attend the ceremony on that day, and Hongqiao Road is very narrow. Traffic and security are very important. Mayor Wu repeatedly instructed this before leaving Shanghai, so he is paying close attention to this matter. The Police Bureau has been requested to increase posts to maintain order at that time. The parking lot in front of the airport is very small, so this afternoon (i.e., yesterday afternoon) after 5 PM, he will go to Hongqiao with representatives from the Police Bureau to inspect and open up a vast</p>
<p>venue.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Price Paid</h3>
<p>The aircraft ordered by the five organizations cost over US$20,000 each, equivalent to over 80,000 silver dollars. Currently, the Ningbo Native Association has independently exchanged US dollars and</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>paid the association a total of 22,227 yuan. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also paid a total of 92,448.69 silver dollars yesterday. Therefore, both organizations have paid the full aircraft price. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce even has surplus funds. The funds raised by the other organizations have also been submitted to the association. The outstanding amount is still being continuously raised.</p>

<h3>Jiangque Aircraft Scheduled to Fly Around the Country</h3>
<p>Flying to Beijing on the 11th and then to Peiping</p>
<p>The Jiangque aircraft, which was delayed in Shanghai to replace its engine, is scheduled to be completed on the 10th and will continue its flight on the 11th to complete the grand feat of circumnavigating the country. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Engine Replacement</h3>
<p>Chen Wenlin, Director of the Xiamen Aviation Office of the Ministry of Navy, accompanied by Pan Dingxin, Chief of the Mechanical Section, departed from Xiamen on July 20 in a self-made two-seater land-based reconnaissance aircraft to undertake the grand feat of circumnavigating the country, in order to arouse the attention of the Chinese people to self-made aircraft. It arrived in Shanghai on the 25th via Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Nanjing, etc. The original engine of the aircraft had 85 horsepower, which was not suitable for long-distance flights, so it was left in Shanghai to replace it with a 120 horsepower engine. Later, due to the time-consuming purchase and transportation of the engine, the troublesome unloading and installation of the fuselage, and the inconvenient round trip to Hongqiao Airport, the completion has been delayed until now. It is currently being processed and rushed to be completed, and it is expected that it will be completed on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Continued Flight</h3>
<p>According to Chen Wenlin's statement to the Central News Agency yesterday, the Jiangque aircraft will be completed on the 10th after replacing the engine in Shanghai. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing on the 11th and leave Beijing for Beiping on the 12th. After staying in Peiping for three days, it will fly south again, passing through Tianjin and returning to Qingdao, and then flying to various places in China. Sun Tonggang is scheduled to come to Shanghai tomorrow (the 6th). Whether he will travel together will only be decided after meeting. If the flight routes are the same, they should be able to travel together.</p>
<h3>British American Tobacco Factory Workers Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Held an Arbitration Meeting Yesterday to Reduce Labor Disputes; Seller's Losses Estimated to Reach 580,000 Yuan</p>
<p>After the workers of the British American Tobacco Company jointly went on strike on the 25th of last month, the Municipal Government formulated a solution and instructed both parties to comply. The Workers' Union Congress, which was held the day before yesterday, originally decided to continue the strike, but after the representatives of the Party and government organs strongly persuaded them, they fully resumed work yesterday. The labor dispute was arbitrated by the Municipal Government yesterday, and the details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Notice of Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>The Five District Cigarette Workers' Union issued a notice to all workers yesterday morning, saying: "Important Notice: The factory defied government orders, dismissed workers without cause, and undermined the conditions for labor-management cooperation. All outstanding cases have been delayed and not resolved. All workers could not bear it any longer and had no choice but to declare a strike to urge the factory to realize its mistakes. Now, under the order of the government, a mediation plan has been formulated: 1) Worker No. 146 of the old factory's tobacco leaf department is allowed to resume work. 2) Wages during the strike period will be paid in full for the old factory, 70% for the old tobacco leaf department, and 50% for the new factory, except that wages for the new factory should be paid in full. Worker No. 938 should be allowed to resume work. Other cases should continue to be mediated and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for legal decision before the 16th of this month. This notice is hereby issued to all workers, who must comply with the order to resume work by 1 PM today. Failure to do so will not be tolerated."</p>
<h3>Report to the Party and Government</h3>
<p>The Workers' Union submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters, saying: "Report on the resumption of work. The entire body of workers of this union, in compliance with the orders of the Municipal Government and the persuasion of the representatives of your Bureau, has resumed work at 1 PM today. All unresolved matters have been discussed at the Representatives' Meeting on the 4th of this month and will be submitted separately for negotiation, awaiting resolution before the 16th of this month. All reasons for the resumption of work are hereby reported to your Associations and Bureaus for review."</p>
<h3>Resumption of Work Method</h3>
<p>The workers of the two factories</p>
<p>considered that the Municipal Government's order actually allowed the dismissal of worker No. 938, so the Representatives' Meeting the day before yesterday continued the strike and submitted a statement to the Social Affairs Bureau. Later, after the representatives of the Party and government organs strongly persuaded them, they agreed to temporarily resume work. Regarding worker No. 938, strike wages for the new factory, and all unresolved cases, it was decided to request the authorities to find a way to resolve them before the 16th, otherwise, another Representatives' Meeting will be held to continue the strike. A notice was also issued to the workers of the old factory that the new factory workers were able to achieve victory because of their sympathy, and the wages will be distributed evenly.</p>
<h3>Protection of Workers</h3>
<p>At 11:30 AM yesterday, Wang Gang, a staff member from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Lu Yinchu, a cadre from the Municipal Party Headquarters, first notified the factory to start work. The Third District Police Bureau also sent armed police officers to protect the factory. At 1 PM, the workers collected funds to purchase firecrackers, which they set off along the way to the factory to show their victory. At the same time, the workers clapped and danced, and were extremely happy.</p>
<h3>Losses of the Capitalists</h3>
<p>According to the Five District Cigarette Workers' Union statistics, the losses of the capitalists in this strike reached 580,000 yuan, including over 4,000 workers in the new factory, who were on strike for 10.5 days. The Municipal Government stipulated that 50% of their wages should be paid, totaling 56,000 yuan. Over 3,000 workers in the old factory's tobacco leaf department were on strike for 27.5 days. The Municipal Government stipulated that 70% of their wages should be paid, and the rest were paid in full for an average of 24 days, totaling 124,000 yuan. Other business losses due to the strike affecting the inability to ship and wholesale goods were estimated at 400,000 yuan, totaling over 580,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Arbitration</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, due to the unpaid wages for the strike in the British American Tobacco factories 1233 in May of this year, which had not yet been resolved, submitted it to arbitration. The Arbitration Committee was convened at 3 PM yesterday. The members attending were Wang Manyun from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Cha Liangzhao from the First Special District Court, Pang Shirong from the District Court, Wang Xiaolai from the Capitalist Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lu Keming from the Labor Committee of the Postal Workers' Union, and Luo Panhui from the Municipal Government. The parties involved were Chen Peide and Liu Dehua from the Five District Cigarette Workers' Union, Chen Tukui and Yu Hua from the Third Factory, and Li Deke and Chen Cangzhou from the Capitalist British American Tobacco Factory. The chairman first summarized the opinions of both parties and submitted them for discussion. Until 5 PM, due to lack of time, it was decided to continue the arbitration at 11 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Italian Vice President Lihua Pays Visit in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that the Italian Vice President of the House of Representatives, Goli Hua, came to China to investigate the silk industry trade. Yesterday morning at 9:50 AM, Mr. Goli Hua invited Mr. Ji Zejin, Secretary of the International Trade Bureau of our Ministry of Industry, by telephone to go to the Cathay Hotel. At 10 AM, he went to the International Trade Bureau together to visit Director He Bingxian. After exchanging pleasantries, they talked for a long time about the market conditions and import and export situation of the Chinese silk industry. Then, at 11 AM, Mr. Goli Hua invited Mr. Ji to accompany him to the Commodity Inspection Bureau to visit Director Cai Wuji. Mr. Cai immediately visited the Cathay Hotel in the afternoon to return the visit. Director He will also visit tomorrow morning (the 6th) at 9:30 AM with Mr. Ji Zejin to promote friendship.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association invited Mr. Goli Hua to visit and exchange opinions on silk sales at 4 PM yesterday. At the same time, they invited Director He Bingxian and Secretary Ji Jinze of the International Trade Bureau, and Director Cai Wuji and Director Guo Limao of the Commodity Inspection Bureau to accompany them. The association was warmly received by former President Zhu Jing'an and current Chairman Shen Huachen, and they were served tea and refreshments. Mr. Goli Hua reported that an international silk industry conference will be held in Paris in October, and he hoped that China would participate. The association plans to ask the Ministry of Industry to preside over the matter. Mr. Goli Hua bid farewell at about 5 PM, while Mr. He and Mr. Cai took their leave one after another at about 6 PM. Mr. Zhu Jing'an invited Mr. Goli Hua to visit his silk factory at 3 PM this afternoon. Mr. He and Mr. Cai are scheduled to host a welcome banquet for him at Xinghua Restaurant at 7 PM tonight. Mr. Goli Hua will take the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Jurong, and other places on the 8th of the month (Friday) to investigate the recent situation of silkworm cocoons and their trade. If Minister Chen Gongbo of the Ministry of Industry is in Beijing (Director He has telegraphed Beijing for instructions), Mr. Goli Hua will go to Beijing from Jurong to pay a special visit to Minister Chen, and then go to Hangzhou. He will come to Shanghai from Hangzhou on the 10th of the month (Monday). The Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association will hold a grand farewell banquet on the 11th. Mr. Goli Hua will return to Rome from Shanghai on the 12th to attend the Paris International Silk Industry Conference in October.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reported that Mr. Goli Hua came to China to solicit our country's participation in the international raw silk production and sales conference to be held in Paris. It is decided to first go to the Hangzhou-Huzhou inland production area to investigate and study, and then go to Beijing to negotiate. Therefore, the welcome banquet originally scheduled for today by the International Trade Bureau, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the raw silk industry at Xinghua Restaurant will probably be canceled.</p>

<h3>Residents of Shenjia Hangzhen Petition for Approval to Reclaim Land from Original Households</h3>
<p>Willing to Abide by All Rules and Regulations and Request to Pay for the Land in the Future</p>
<p>Wang Haoen, Yang Zhongying, Ge Minggao, Shen Songtao, Zhang Shuxun, Cai Jinzhang, and others, representing all the residents of Shenjia Hangzhen in the central district of the city, jointly petitioned regarding the Municipal Government's land acquisition. They stated in their petition that they, the residents who have lived in Shenjia Hangzhen in the Yinxiang District for generations, numbering one hundred and fifty to sixty families, engaged in agriculture, commerce, industry, and education, and lived peacefully. Now that the Greater Shanghai plan is about to be realized, their town is suitably located in the city center. Everything is better for the residents. Therefore, they were notified and ordered to surrender their land at a price of 300 yuan per mu and receive the payment in order to engage in operations and re-release the land (it is said that the price per mu is 2,000 yuan). The residents will naturally comply with the policy to speed up the implementation of the new administration. However, the residents have lived and eaten here for many years, and it is the hometown of their ancestors' tombs. How can they bear to abandon it? Thinking about the reason why the Municipal Government is doing this, it is nothing more than that the old-style buildings in the town are not suitable for the times and should be rearranged with the latest degree to make them neat and uniform in order to improve appearances and serve as a model. It is truly designed for the matter and not for the people. Only if it does not hinder the matter, it will naturally not choose the people. Therefore, the residents all intend to surrender the land and receive the payment, and they will absolutely obey. However, after the planning is finalized in the future, it will inevitably be re-released, and the re-acquired property rights must still belong to the original households. As for how to demolish, how to reform, and how to rebuild the style, all will be subject to the Municipal Government's review and instructions, and they will all be obeyed. For example, if a household holds three-tenths of a mu of land in the town, it should immediately receive 90 yuan at a price of 300 yuan per mu. In the future, when it is re-released, it should immediately pay 600 yuan at a price of 2,000 yuan per mu, paying a net amount of 510 yuan. All measures for the land will be fully obeyed, with the primary goal of not hindering the new system. In this way, the upper level will not be concerned about government orders, and the lower level can meet the public's sentiments. The budgetary funding issues will also be unharmed. It is truly a one-off solution to several problems. Who does not have a home? The heart is the same. The humble suggestions will surely be fully realized by the Municipal Government. We humbly present this petition, begging for your review and approval, and we will obey the instructions. Public virtue and convenience will be served. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Qian War Resumes, You Guocai Reports the War Situation to Shanghai by Telegram</h3>
<p>Long Yun Issues Final Warning to Wang Jialie. Guowen News Agency reported that reports of the war in central Guizhou are frequent and vary from person to person. In order to understand the truth, the reporter specially visited Mr. Deng Mingjie, who is familiar with the situation in Guizhou, to inquire about the details. He showed a telegram from You Guocai in winter, describing the past facts and the current war situation in detail. The original text is as follows: "Mr. Deng Mingjie Xun Jian, Confidential, Unfortunately, my Guizhou has been repeatedly abandoned. Chiang Shi-chang is returning, and Che Shi-chang Mingyi is advancing westward. Cai is also leading his troops across the river. Originally, it was planned to launch an attack on three routes, but it was blocked by Zhigong and was willing to mediate. He had no choice but to retreat to Panba. I believe that since the neighboring province has come out to mediate, Wang Jialie may have the intention of repenting. On the one hand, he used sweet words to deal with Zhigong, and on the other hand, he actively used troops. Pi Xu failed because of this. Recently, according to repeated telegrams from Yuru, the enemy army, led by Liao, Shi, Pi, and Cao, about 10,000 people, under the order of Shao Wu, joined forces to attack Tongren on May 15. Compelled to defend themselves, they should contact Shi-chang Yang and Commander Keda Li and launch a simultaneous attack. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, they were fortunate to have repelled all the enemies and captured more than 1,000 enemy guns near Shuitang Zhuanshan Tang and Tongcheng. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. More than two battalions died in Puhe. In order to take care of the local situation, our army did not pursue them. But the enemy resumed their reconnaissance of Liangjiangkou, attempting a counterattack. The two units of Qichang and Keda fought fiercely all day but were still repelled. The battle was even fiercer on both sides. The enemy army suffered a terrible defeat, with more than two regiments killed or wounded. Now Liao and Pi have retreated to Yuping, and Cao has retreated to Jiangkou. It is decided to follow up and pursue them, and Cai is urged to supervise the crossing of the river. Cai once telegraphed to Zhigong to inquire how to deal with it, and received a reply that he had telegraphed Nugang to issue a final warning to Wang on May 15, saying that if Wang insisted on his plan to defeat them one by one, he would have to withdraw from the peace talks, and asked Nugang to leave Guizhou. Otherwise, he must effectively stop military action from September 1 and listen to the mediation of Chiang and Che, which must still be handled together. Zhigong's concern for the prosperity of Guizhou is very admirable, but Shao Wu has always been superstitious about force. Since the Cantonese equipment arrived, he has been determined to eliminate dissidents. I am afraid that it cannot be salvaged by words. You love your hometown and admire your noble character. I hope you can find a way to dissuade him and guide him to peace. I pray for you. You Guocai bowed in winter."</p>

<h3>The Tragic Situation of the Disaster Victims in the Outer Beaches of Songkou</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from Chuansha Zhiyuantang yesterday, saying that a tidal disaster occurred in Hengsha, Gaodunsha, and on the evening of that day, causing many deaths. They urgently need relief food and coffins. The association sent Zhenyuan Li Junyunmen to investigate. According to the report, the real situation of the disaster-stricken embankment names, houses, and households in Hengsha is as follows: More than 300 households were affected in Yuanjia Embankment, with houses still standing. More than 50 households were affected in the south side of the Lao Embankment, with houses washed away.

More than 100 households in Xiao Hengsha were completely destroyed. More than 300 households in Beihongzi Embankment were completely submerged. 80 households in Niujiaodong were completely submerged. The western half of the Lao Xiao Gaodun Embankment was breached, submerging about 700 to 800 households. The Lao and Xiao Shuang embankments in Beimui Embankment were not affected. There is also Yuanyuan sand in the territory of Chuan County, but the number of disaster-stricken households has not yet been determined, and all embankments have been breached. The association is now receiving disaster reports from various places like snowflakes. Where can we find compassionate and patriotic people and enthusiastic comrades to rescue the people from the flood and reduce the catastrophe by one in ten thousand.</p>
<p>A telegram from Baoshan County Magistrate Jin: "The Jiataibao Relief Institute Preparatory Committee informs all newspapers and charities that according to a report from the patrol officer of Jian Shui Patrol Team, Changxing and other five sandbanks were submerged by 60% due to the hurricane and sea tide on the evening of the 2nd. About 50 to 60 sandbank residents were drowned, and all embankments and seedlings were destroyed. In addition to urgently telegraphing the provincial government to send personnel to provide relief, please quickly assist in providing relief. Jin Qingzhang, County Magistrate of Baoshan, micro-seal."</p>
<p>Another message stated that during the emergency hurricane on the evening of the 2nd, the tide surged, and the embankment of Yawo Sha outside Wusongkou was collapsed by huge waves. The tide suddenly rushed into the farmers near the Heiputai of the Mountain Harbor North First Street, and about 100 men, women, and children were drowned by the tide. The houses collapsed and drifted away without a trace. It is said that the incident happened in the middle of the night, and the residents were awakened from their sleep, so they could not escape. It was a tragedy. It is also said that on the east side of Yawo Sha, there is a small sandbank called Tongyuan Sha. Half of the residents were drowned by the tide. However, there are very few residents on the sandbank, only 20 to 30 households, with a total of less than 100 men, women, and children.</p>
<h3>Recent News of the Banditry in Yingfu Tai</h3>
<p>The Hong Wanzi Society's relief commissioner's report on the expansion of the bandits in Yingfu Tai to the extent of three counties and the tragic situation has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Now, it is reported that Mr. Wang Daoyuan, the relief commissioner of the Hong Wanzi Society, has sent a letter, which is excerpted as follows: "Dear Sirs, After arriving in Ying, while I was investigating, I heard that the bandits had news of moving eastward again, only thirty miles away from Fuyang. The counties of Fu and Ying are asking for troops to suppress them. No matter what, I will risk going to Nanzhao Ji Shibali Pu, eighteen miles south of Ying, and then go to Yongxing Ji to take a detour to Huiliu Ji to assess the severity of the disaster and the number of households to allocate funds. If there are any surplus funds, I will go to Taihe Jiuxian Ji, because the number of injuries and looting in that Ji is equal to the abuse of Nanzhao Huiliu, etc. I cannot bear to ignore it. I have been entrusted by you all, and I will never retreat. I must personally go to the disaster area and send the donations from all the philanthropists to the hands of the victims, so as not to let down the good intentions of your commission." At the same time, the Anhui Fellow Association sent many maps of the disaster area, detailing the bandit-stricken areas.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Headquarters and Branches Urgently Handling Yellow River Flood Relief</h3>
<p>Since the Yellow River flood occurred, the various Red Swastika Society headquarters and branches have held emergency meetings in Peiping, Jinan, and Shanghai to raise funds for urgent relief. The headquarters has raised 50,000 yuan, and the Jinan branch has raised 30,000 yuan. Teams were immediately formed and dispatched to the disaster areas for relief. It is reported that the Peiping headquarters and the Jinan branch have both sent letters to the Southeast Red Swastika Society's Shanghai office, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Headquarters Letter: After the Yellow River flood occurred, a team leader was immediately dispatched to investigate, and it was decided to organize five relief teams immediately. President Su Jinglin has led one team, carrying relief funds and medicines, to Shandong's Dong'e, Pingyin, Puyang, Shou Zhang, and Yanggu counties for emergency relief. Team leader Cao Yuan was also appointed to take funds and medicines to the Zhengshan Lake area of southern Shandong before winter for relief. Furthermore, President Yu Yuan led a team to distribute grain and funds together with the Zhengzhou Red Swastika Society. Now, they have taken relief funds and medicines to Wenxian, Huaxian, and Kaocheng for distribution. Telegrams have also been sent to the chairmen of Shandong and Henan provinces, instructing the counties to assist in protection. The disaster situation in Kaocheng is particularly severe, with the area completely flooded. Relief workers either cling to the city walls for support, or search for wooden planks to connect for passage, or break through roofs to observe the investigation and relief efforts. The hardships are too numerous to describe. Currently, the autumn flood has not subsided, the rivers are overflowing, and the situation is turbulent, causing fear and apprehension.</p>
<p>Jinan Branch Letter: At the beginning of the Shandong flood, the branch immediately dispatched Team Leader Yu Fuhe, leading a team with grain and funds, to the hardest-hit areas for distribution. Later, due to insufficient personnel, another relief team was organized and dispatched to Shou Zhang and other counties to handle urgent relief. It was decided at a meeting to raise 20,000 yuan first and continue to work with the various teams of the headquarters to carry out relief efforts. However, with continuous rain and wind, the water level fluctuates, and the waves are turbulent. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are exposed to the wind and rain, a scene too tragic to bear. It is reported that the Shanghai office of the Red Swastika Society has allocated 5,500 yuan successively for the headquarters and Jinan branch to handle urgent relief separately. At the same time, circulars were sent to the various Southeast Red Swastika Societies for unified assistance, with sincere words such as "If the water level rises again, Jiangsu province will also be in imminent danger. Saving others is saving oneself." The office has received telegrams from various branches in recent days, all expressing their unanimous support. It is estimated that more than 10,000 yuan can be raised for the floods in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong.</p>
<h3>Fujian Situation Peaceful, Goods and Passengers Still Arriving</h3>
<p>Recently, in Fuzhou, after the arrival of Japanese troops, people became very uneasy. Merchants rushed to transport goods to Shanghai, and the number of passengers coming to Shanghai was also very crowded. Fujian merchants urgently telegraphed Shanghai to add ships to meet the demand. The situation yesterday is reported as follows:</p>
<h3>Stockpiled Goods Shipped Out Ahead of Schedule</h3>
<p>Since September 2nd, the large arrival of Japanese warships in Fuzhou has caused public unrest, and bandits have reappeared to spread rumors. Therefore, for the sake of protecting their business capital, the merchants in Fujian shipped all the goods stockpiled in Fuzhou ahead of schedule to Shanghai for safety. As a result, the Wansheng, Chang'an, Jiesheng, and other ships arriving in Shanghai on Sunday were all full of goods. There are hundreds of thousands of pieces of goods waiting to be shipped in Fujian, urgently needing tonnage for transportation. On the one hand, Shanghai merchants were telegraphed to temporarily postpone shipping goods.</p>
<h3>Passengers Crowd into Shanghai</h3>
<p>Normally, there are not many passengers traveling back and forth on the Shanghai-Fujian routes. Therefore, the shipping companies all focus on cargo. However, since last Saturday, the situation has suddenly changed. The wealthier people in Fuzhou are rushing to the shipping companies to buy tickets, going to Hong Kong and Shanghai. Because there are fewer ships going to Hong Kong, most have switched to Shanghai-Fujian ships to Shanghai. Yesterday, when the Sanbei Wansheng ship arrived, a large number of Fujianese people brought their families to Shanghai, with a lot of luggage. According to passengers arriving in Shanghai, there are still a large number of passengers in Fuzhou waiting for ships, preparing to leave Fujian and live in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Merchants Telegraph Request to Dispatch Ships</h3>
<p>In the past three days, merchants in Fuzhou have flocked to the Min Branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting additional ships to be sent to Fuzhou. There are large quantities of goods urgently awaiting shipment. The Min Branch has sent two telegrams to Shanghai, requesting the head office to quickly dispatch ships to Fujian to meet the needs of the merchants, so that the good business will not be seized by foreign ships. Finally, another telegram arrived, saying that the gentry in Fujian had sent a request to the branch to quickly send a ship with more passenger capacity to Fujian for the general gentry to take to Shanghai. It is best to order the Puan ship to make a trip, so as to meet the needs of the passengers.</p>
<h3>General Situation in Fujian Settled</h3>
<p>Yanping has been recovered by the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, and the communist bandits have also been repelled. The situation in Fujian has suddenly turned peaceful, and the overall situation is stable. Some warships have also sailed to the area, and people's hearts are gradually settling down. The shipping companies' matter of increasing ships will also be temporarily postponed.</p>
<h3>Swedish Prince to Visit Shanghai This Weekend</h3>
<p>Prince Carl of Sweden, who is visiting China this time, arrived in Peiping on the 4th. According to diplomatic sources, Prince Carl is scheduled to leave Peiping and return to Shanghai this weekend, and then go to Hangzhou for sightseeing. He will also get off the train and stay for a while when passing through Tianjin. It is said that Kong Xiangxi, President of the Central Bank, will hold a tea party to entertain the Prince after Prince Carl returns to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Failure of Appeal for the Case of Robbery of More Than 129,000 Yuan by Three Thieves</h3>
<p>In the case of the robbery of 129,080 yuan in Yong'an Street in the French Concession in June, the police arrested three major thieves, Zhang Huicai, Wang Maonan, and Li Along (also known as Scarred Along). After interrogation by the Special First Court, Zhang was sentenced to ten years and six months of imprisonment for habitual robbery, and Wang and Li were sentenced to nine years of imprisonment each. The three thieves refused to accept the original sentence and hired lawyers to appeal to the High Third Branch Court. The collegiate panel concluded the trial on the 1st of this month. Yesterday afternoon, the families and friends of the three thieves came to the court to hear the verdict, hoping for a reduced sentence. At 2:30, Judge Zhou, along with Judges Guo and Fan, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao, came to the Third Criminal Court to bring the appellants to the court for sentencing. The appeal was rejected. After the verdict, when the three thieves were escorted back to the detention center, their families learned of the failed appeal and cried bitterly, as if they had lost their parents. After being driven away by the bailiffs, they dispersed.</p>
<h3>Electric Poles Blown Down in Yangsi Town, Pudong, Resulting in Four Deaths</h3>
<p>The deceased suffered an unexpected disaster. The landlord settled the matter with ten yuan.</p>
<p>In front of the Zhang family's residence south of the Shiqiao in Yangsi Town, Pudong, during the hurricane the night before, the cement electric pole was blown down, and the wires were also broken at the same time. As a result, the ground was full of electric sparks. Because of the heavy wind and rain at that time, no one knew about it until the next morning, when three men and one woman, a total of four people, were electrocuted. It was later found that one of the deceased was an old clerk from a rice store in the town, who went out to ask someone to treat his heatstroke and was electrocuted. The other two men and one woman were vegetable vendors. When they were carrying vegetables to the market at dawn, they were electrocuted. After the local bailiff found out, he reported it to the Shanghai Local Court. Yesterday morning, the prosecutor and forensic doctor went to the countryside for an inquest and ordered the family members of the deceased to collect the bodies for burial. The family members of the deceased were all angry at the landlord. At first, they planned to carry the dead into the gate, but after mediation, the Zhang family paid 40 yuan, 10 yuan each, to settle the matter.</p>
<h3>The Chauffeur's Affair</h3>
<p>The Yangzhou maid is too romantic, confessing that everything was voluntary.</p>
<p>A Yangzhou woman, Chen Qiu, has been working as a servant in the Yuan family at No. 10 Taihe Village, Weihaiwei Road for several years. Chen Qiu has a niece named Qiu Lan Ying, who is 15 years old this year. Her father died early, and she lives with her mother in Yangzhou. Because the family is poor, Chen Qiu asked her to come to Shanghai on credit to work as a servant in the Yuan family. Because Yuan's family often has many servants, there is a Zhejiang man named Gu Afa who works as a chauffeur in the Yuan family. He is just a young man, handsome and romantic. Seeing that Qiu Lan Ying has reached the age of fifteen and is emotionally developed, he tries to seduce her. The girl does not refuse, and the two are in love. Gu Afa's job was suddenly terminated, so the two could not see each other every day, but cherished the thought of each other. Because the net of love is hard to escape, they disregarded the consequences. At 9:00 a.m. on the 30th of last month, Gu secretly returned to his master's house and devised a plan to lure Qiu out and go to Room 48 of the Aiwenyi Road Wenlv Hotel for the night. Qiu Lan Ying's virginity was lost at that time. Qiu Lan Ying was raped up to six times in a row for five consecutive nights. Since her niece disappeared, Chen Qiu was extremely anxious and searched everywhere. It was not until she found out that Lan Ying had been abducted by Gu Afa that she knew where she was hiding. Until 7:00 p.m. the night before, she met Gu on Weihaiwei Road and reported it to the Chinese police officer No. 754, who took Gu to the Xinzha Police Station. A Chinese detective, Hua Guobao, was sent to the servant introduction agency at No. 35 Beidou Ao Road in the French Concession to find Qiu Lan Ying and return her to the police station. He sent the girl to the hospital to confirm that she had been raped and detained Gu. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to the lawyer Tu Yaotang, who represented the police station, the above situation was stated, saying that the defendant is now being prosecuted for the crime of disrupting the family under Article 57 of the Criminal Law and the crime of rape under Article 140. In addition to the victim's testimony in court today, Chen A Gen, a waiter at the Aiwen Hotel, can testify. According to the woman Chen Qiu, Lan Ying is my niece, and I brought her from her mother in Yangzhou to Shanghai to work with me in the Yuan family. The defendant was also a chauffeur in the same house. After being laid off on the 28th of last month, Zhao Riguan, Ying suddenly disappeared. I didn't know who had abducted him at first. Yao A, Lan Ying's younger sister, told me that he had been abducted by Gu Afa. I ran into him on the way yesterday and reported the case. According to Qiu Lan Ying, I discussed with the defendant to take the initiative to go out and open a room together on the 30th of last month, and stayed there for five days. I also willingly had a physical relationship with the defendant. The judge asked her whether she would accuse the defendant of rape. The girl replied that she would accuse him and asked to be punished according to the law. Chen A Gen, a waiter at the Aiwen Hotel, also testified that the defendant and the girl came to open Room 48 together and stayed there for five days. The defendant used the pseudonym Chen Zirong and Qiu used the pseudonym Wang. It was not until yesterday morning that they left. According to Yao A, a woman who works as a servant in Yuan's relatives' house, I met Qiu at Chen Jia's small vegetable market yesterday morning. She told me about this and asked me to find a matchmaking shop. I led them to the servant introduction agency in the French Concession. The defendant Gu Afa confessed that he had sex with Qiu, who is fifteen years old, and admitted that he had stayed in a hotel and had sex six times. However, he claimed that Qiu did not want to live in the Yuan family anymore and voluntarily went out with me to open a room and stay there, and there was no coercion. After the Wang lawyer from the police station and the lawyer designated to defend the defendant debated with each other, Judge Yu Gui reported and instructed that the debate in this case was over and the verdict would be delivered on the 7th of this month. The defendant was returned to custody, and Qiu Lan Ying was taken back by Chen Qiu.</p>

<h3>Pan Deming, Chinese Youth Walker, Successfully Circumnavigates the World After Three Years of Walking</h3>
<p>In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the eight members departed from Shanghai and returned midway one after another. He successfully walked around the world alone. After three years of success and failure, he safely arrived in Geneva. In June of the 19th year of the Republic of China, a young man named Li Mengsheng and others initiated the organization of the Chinese Youth Asia Walking Group with the aim of traveling around the world. A total of eight male and female members, on June 28 of the same year departed from Shanghai. The various groups in Shanghai enthusiastically sent them off to boost their morale. However, since the group departed, news has been isolated and there has been no news. It has been three years since then. No one knows the life or death of the group members. People from all walks of life have long forgotten about the group's whereabouts and no longer pay attention. Yesterday, according to a traveler who returned from Europe, he talked about the Youth Walking Group, saying that a group member arrived safely in Geneva in June of this year. After walking for three years, wading thousands of miles, and experiencing dozens of countries large and small, they were welcomed by local officials and people. It is an unparalleled honor for our country in the international arena. The group member's name is Pan Deming, from Huzhou. He is only 23 years old this year. After arriving in Geneva, he soon set off for Lyon, France, to continue his walking work, hoping to complete the entire journey. The traveler had a long conversation with the young walker and asked him in detail about his walking experience. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Three Years of Cold and Heat, Thousands of Miles of Trekking</h3>
<p>When Li Mengsheng initiated the organization of the Chinese Youth Asia Walking Group, nearly a hundred people signed up from all walks of life. Only eight people passed the screening, five men and three women, all young students, namely Li Mengsheng, a native of Longxi, 27 years old, Chen Wu, a native of Siming, 26 years old, Fang Yue, a native of Suzhou, 24 years old, Pan Deming, a native of Huzhou, 21 years old, female group member Hu Sujuan, a native of Longxi, 23 years old, and three male group members Feng Binghun, female group member Cui Xiaojiong and Cui Qiufang. After departing from Shanghai on June 28 of the 19th year, they all returned midway in Songjiang and Hangzhou due to illness and weakness. The remaining five group members continued to move forward. The entire journey of the group is divided into three phases, limited to five years. On August 17, they departed from Hangzhou, passed through Ningbo, Wenzhou, Pingyang, and arrived in Fuzhou, then turned to Shantou, Chaozhou, Meixian, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Qiongzhou, the border of French Vietnam, Tokyo, Qinghua, Saigon, Phnom Penh, Battambang, Siam, Aran, Bangkok to the Malay Peninsula, and then from Kedah, Shuangyu, to Penang, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore. This is the first phase of the trip, from Singapore by sea to Sumatra, Java, Borneo, to Myanmar via India, Afghanistan, Persia, Arabia, to Constantinople. This is the second phase of the trip. Starting from Constantinople, they will go directly to various European countries via Turkey, and then cross the Pacific Ocean to the United States and return to China via Japan. This is the third phase of the trip, which is also the final destination. Now Mr. Pan Deming has walked to Geneva, completing the second phase of the trip. It took more than three years to wash away the shame of the sick man of East Asia. It is truly magnificent.</p>
<h3>Circumnavigating the World Alone</h3>
<p>When the five members of the group arrived in Xiamen, two comrades, Chen Wu and Huang Yue, could not travel together due to illness. When they arrived at An Hai Fang Tokyo in Thanh Hoa, Li Mengsheng and Hu Sujuan also fell ill on the journey. At this point, out of the eight people in the country, only Pan Deming was left. Therefore, Pan traveled alone and continued to move forward. He first went to Siam, then changed his itinerary, from Saigon, Phnom Penh, Battambang, Bangkok, Kedah, to Penang Island, then to Singapore, by sea to Sumatra, Java, Borneo, via India, across the Pamir Plateau, the Himalayas, across Turkey, and finally arrived in Geneva in June of this year. He traveled alone, traversing various countries, and was able to remain safe and sound.</p>
<h3>Enduring Hardships</h3>
<p>According to the traveler, the young walker's face was full of dust and his arms were black, but his physique was very strong and his spirit was excellent. His luggage was very small, with only a few items for personal use. When he arrived in Penang Island, he felt quite lonely because he was traveling alone, so he bought a bicycle to travel by. Since then, walking has turned into a journey. He can travel more than 190 miles a day, but after passing through India and Turkey, he encountered bandits twice. The first time he was not robbed, but the second time the bandits robbed his bicycle. Fortunately, he was not injured, and the journey on the bicycle was changed back to walking. For more than three years, he has been traveling long distances, either climbing high mountains or crossing rivers and seas. Regardless of wind, frost, cold, or heat, he has suffered a lot. Along the way, there were many twists and turns, obstacles, and dangerous situations that are difficult to describe. When passing through the great forest of India, lions, tigers, leopards, and wolves often came out to eat people. Mr. Pan once lay on a large tree for three nights and days, but whenever he arrived at a place, he was warmly welcomed by the locals, visited institutions and groups, and attended lectures, which was very busy. Local governments have assisted travelers, and Mr. Pan has also sold photos taken along the way from time to time to cover travel expenses. It is also heard that Mr. Pan has been able to decipher the texts and languages of 30 countries, and the information he has obtained is very rich. After Mr. Pan arrived in Geneva, he set off for Paris, France, to travel to England, Germany, and Italy, and then crossed the Pacific Ocean to the Americas to return to China via Japan, so as to complete the final journey. It is expected that the young walker will be able to complete the entire journey in the late part of next year and return home with praise.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of the Assassination of Gao Lansheng</h3>
<p>The police investigation was very detailed, but evidence still needs to be collected for a retrial at a later date.</p>
<p>Gao Lansheng, also known as Gao A Gen, who opened a flower shop and made red pills, has recently been arrested by the French police along with his friend Sun Quanhai (nicknamed Little Mustache) for committing a crime. However, before being arrested, Gao and others were suddenly shot at by enemies at the entrance of Leyuli Lane, Fuzhou Road. After the Laozha Police Station Deputy Detective Xie Shuiquan investigated, he found that two people, Tong Tianhua (also known as Qiaojiao A San) and Li Jinshan (also known as Wang Jinshan) from Nanjing, were greatly involved in the shooting incident. Tong and Li were taken to the First Special District Court, and they were ordered to be detained pending investigation and prosecution. According to the police investigation, on August 6,</p>
<h3>Sudden Shooting Attempt</h3>
<p>It was committed by Tong and Li and his accomplices who were at large. Therefore, he prosecuted Li for murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the First Special Court, opened a court hearing and sent Gao A Gen and Sun Quanhai to the court to testify. First, the lawyer Ru Baoyi, who represented the police station, gave a detailed account of the beginning and end of the defendant's intention to kill Gao. He said that the flower shop gambling in this city has a long history. In the past ten years, it was first led by Mao A Xiang, and then Zhao A Wu rose to</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Prestige as Mao</h3>
<p>Until the 19th year of the Republic of China, Gao A Gen also rose suddenly. The defendant Tong Tianhua in this case was the beloved disciple of Mao A Xiang. In February and March of the 19th year, Tong's family in Deshouli, Erjin Road, was suddenly attacked by four or five gangsters early in the morning. One of the murderers was named Xiao Ba Mei. Tong knew that he was a disciple of Gao A Gen, so he complained to his master Mao A Xiang. Mao believed that Gao wanted to kill his disciples, so he also sent five people to</p>
<h3>Organize a Gao Killing Group</h3>
<p>The second defendant in this case, Li Jinshan, was one of the five group members. The country used Chen as its leader, and Mao allocated 500 yuan in cash as the group's expenses. At that time, Gao A Gen fled to Hankou because the courts in Shanghai were tightly controlling him. The five-member group then tracked him down to Hankou, hoping to plot against him there. Gao was also well-informed and learned of it in advance, and reported it to the Hankou Public Security Bureau. When the five group members arrived in Hankou, four of them were arrested and transferred to the local court for investigation. As a result, Qiaojiao Yonglin and Xu Guangxiao were each sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment. Li Jinshan and another group member were acquitted, and the Chen, who was promoted as the leader,</p>
<h3>Lucky Escape</h3>
<p>From then on, the hatred between Mao and Gao deepened. It happened by chance that Wang Zhenxiang, Gao A Gen's subordinate, who was also known as Xiao Gui A Liu, was assassinated in the French Concession in May of last year. Gao A Gen immediately announced that the murderer was Tong Tianhua, and the French police arrested Tong to investigate and interrogate him. Until this month, the court ruled that Tong was released without charge. Just as Gao was being chased by the court, he sneaked to another port.</p>
<h3>The Murder Could Have Been Stopped</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, on July 28, Tong dared not return to his home in Zhabei because the red pill organization in his house was searched by the Public Security Bureau. He fled outside and suddenly heard that Gao had returned to Shanghai, and he still could not forget him. He met with Li Jinshan to temporarily stay at the New World Hotel for three consecutive days, opening three rooms, 120, 122, and 127, and discussed the plan to kill Gao. Chen, the former leader of the five-member group, also participated. Tong originally had a pistol, which he hid at home. This time, his home was searched, and the pistol was lost. Therefore, Chen promised to supply the pistol. On August 2, they</p>
<h3>Relocation to the Great Eastern Hotel</h3>
<p>Room number 229. On the 5th, at dusk, Tong went out. While walking along Zhejiang Road, he encountered a man named Ah Rong.</p>
<p>Tong knew that Ah Rong was associated with Gao A'gen. However, Ah Rong was known to be greedy for profit. If given some money, it would not be difficult to find out A'gen's whereabouts. Tong then engaged Ah Rong in conversation. As expected, he learned from Ah Rong that A'gen would be hosting a dinner party that night at the house of a prostitute named Yuan Yuan in Huile Lane, and the party would disperse around 3 PM. After finding this out, Tong returned to the Great Eastern Hotel. Around 10 PM, Chen arrived. Tong told Chen the information he had obtained. Chen immediately went out to invite an accomplice. Each of them carried a pistol and returned to the Great Eastern Hotel. Then, they went to the Dajiangnan Hotel on Fujian Road to invite Li Jinshan and a Mr. Xu. Li and the others were gambling and didn't arrive until 11 PM. Except for Tong, who</p>
<h3>Limped due to a Foot Ailment</h3>
<p>Liu Shou remained at the Great Eastern Hotel to keep watch. The other four went together. Li waited in front of the Tianchan Stage to keep watch until 1 AM the next morning. Gao and others came out of the brothel. Chen saw a man getting into a car and mistook him for Gao A'gen. He immediately opened fire. In fact, this person had a small mustache and was a friend of Gao's. Soon, the police arrived after hearing the gunshots. The group opened fire to resist arrest, fortunately only wounding the person. Li waited at the Great Eastern Hotel until 5 AM, but didn't see the others return. Realizing that the mission had failed, he fled. This is the</p>
<h3>Factual Account of Gao's Murder Attempt</h3>
<p>Now, the witnesses are all present, requesting an investigation," and so on. Subsequently, Gao A'gen described the perilous situation that night, stating that</p>
<p>the person he saw shooting was a fat man, and Li Jinshan was running away. He knew Tong Tianhua originally, etc. Chief Qian then questioned Gao about the situation in Hankou and the murder of Wang Zhenxiang in the past. Sun Haiquan testified that because he was a friend of Gao's, Gao hosted a wash-dust dinner for him upon his return from abroad. After leaving the brothel and getting into the car, he suddenly heard gunshots and jumped out in shock, causing him to fall to the ground. He immediately honked the horn to alert others, etc. The court then interrogated the two defendants separately. However, when questioned about the shooting on August 6th, the defendants all evaded the question. Other matters remained the same as their statements at the police station, with no changes. Chief Qian ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Anonymous Letter</h3>
<p>The letter to Lu Ying accused him of inducing a female servant to become a concubine, leading to a thorough investigation and multiple arrests.</p>
<p>Lu Ying, the captain of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Squad, recently received a strange anonymous letter. The letter accused Chen Liangfu, a detective in the squad, in bizarre terms. The original letter stated, "Several dozen days ago, Chen Liangfu, a detective in your squad, colluded with a local gangster named Zhang Fusheng in Zhangjia Lane, Gaoqiao, Pudong, to lure a female servant from Zhang Renrong's house in Zhangjia Lane to Jin Guangsheng's house on Lin Gui Road, Zhabei. Using intimidating tactics, they tried to sell the female servant into prostitution. When she refused, Chen Liangfu took out a pistol to intimidate her, forcing her to comply or he would shoot her dead, etc. It is also heard that the girl is fairly attractive, and Chen Liangfu has claimed to others that he is acting on the orders of your captain and wants to take this girl as a concubine. Her whereabouts are currently unknown. If the captain wants to marry a concubine,</p>
<h3>The Patriotic Propaganda Troupe of the Shanghai Art Academy, After Traveling 20,000 Miles Through Eleven Provinces, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Bringing Back a Large Collection of Mongolian Artifacts to be Exhibited Publicly in Beijing and Shanghai</p>
<p>The Patriotic Propaganda Troupe of the Shanghai Art Academy set out this spring, introduced by the central government, to the front lines of the Yangtze River, North China, and the Mongolian border to engage in anti-Japanese propaganda. The journey lasted seven months, passing through the eleven provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Shandong, covering a distance of 20,000 miles. When Tianjin and Beijing were in crisis, the troupe rushed to the front lines to encourage soldiers and garner support, working extremely hard. After the Tanggu Truce, they left Pingjin and went beyond the Great Wall to Chahar, Suiyuan, Baotou, and Ulanqab League to engage in Mongolian propaganda. The various border tribes were deeply moved. Now that the troupe's propaganda work has come to an end, they returned to Beijing via Baotou and Peiping at the end of last month, reporting to the relevant central authorities. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The troupe has faced numerous dangers in the Yangtze River, North China, and Mongolian regions, but the impact of their work has been enormous. Shen Yiqian, the head of the troupe, has also taken hundreds of photographs and sketches in the northwest and Mongolian regions, and collected a large number of woolen fabrics, medicinal materials, mineral products, etc., which have been shipped to Shanghai. Once they are sorted, they will be publicly exhibited in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>why must it be this female servant? It's truly outrageous. Or is it that Detective Chen fancied this girl and used the captain's name to intimidate and drive her away, or perhaps she has been sold off? All are unknown. Now, Zhang Renrong has searched everywhere without success and will soon file a lawsuit against your captain in court. Hopefully, you will investigate carefully and not be deceived by the great master Chen, otherwise great misfortune will befall you. I am sending this letter to notify you in advance. If no proper investigation is conducted and the person is not handed over, then I will use mimeographed flyers to distribute them to citizens and ask for public opinion, to see how your captain handles it," and so on. After reading the letter, Captain Lu was completely bewildered and immediately ordered Detective Li Jinqing to conduct a thorough investigation with Chen Liangfu. As a result, it was discovered that Zhang Chengzhong, who was engaged in advertising at No. 19 Zhangjia Lane, Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, harbored resentment because his sworn sister, Shi Caiping, had an affair with his friend Zhang Hesheng. Zhang Chengzhong then conspired with Chongming Guan Sheng (i.e., Jin Guansheng) to sell her off, etc. After receiving the information, Captain Lu, together with the police chief of the relevant police station, arrested Zhu Youshan, his wife Wang, and Jin Taoshi, the wife of Guan Sheng, at No. 5 Yingui Road, Zhabei, for attempting to sell her. He then continued to arrest the pimp Jin Guangsheng and Wang Baoqi at the Bund Tongren Pier on Nanjing Road. Afterwards, together with the Gaoqiao Town office in the Pudong district, Zhang Chengzhong was arrested, along with Zhang You, Zhang Hesheng, and Zhang's female servant, his sworn sister Shi Caiping, a total of eight men and women. After being interrogated, they all confessed to the truth of the case, and Zhang Hesheng and Shi Caiping also admitted to adultery. When questioned about the fact that Zhang Chengzhong was intending to sell Caiping, Zhang evaded the question and contradicted himself. After the interrogation, Captain Lu ordered them to be separately detained and sent to the Judicial Section for review and investigation.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu High Court Third Branch Agrees to Transfer Shi Yi</h3>
<p>Claimed to be an Alias of Deng Zhongxia, Hearing Forbidden, and Further Deliberation</p>
<p>On May 15th of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau received a confidential report from an informant stating that Du Linying, the director of the rescue department of the Communist Party's National Mutual Aid Society, also known as Chuan Jiying, was hiding in the attic room on the second floor of No. 37 Junde Lane, Huanlong Road in the French Concession. Please go and arrest him, etc. Director Wen Hong'en, based on the report, prepared a document and sent personnel to the French Police Station, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Political Department. That evening at 10:30 PM, they rushed to the address to search and arrest. However, Du had gone out and was not found. Only two people were arrested: Lin Suqin (23 years old), a woman from Sichuan, and Shi Yi (37 years old), from Hunan. Anti-revolutionary propaganda materials, letters, and other items were confiscated and taken back to the police station. The next day, they were sent to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After interrogation, it was ruled that Lin Suqin would be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation, and Shi Yi would be handled by the court for trial. The trial has been held several times without a conclusion. Lin, after being taken away, repented and surrendered herself and has been released by the central government to seek formal employment elsewhere. It has now been discovered by the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters that Shi Yi is an alias of Deng Zhongxia. Deng was the secretary of the Central Political Bureau of the Western Hubei Red Army and founded the Red Flag Weekly, etc. The headquarters reported to Chairman Chiang, who telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to transfer him to their custody for interrogation. Director Wen received the telegram and prepared a document yesterday afternoon, sending personnel to the High Court Third Branch to request the transfer of Shi. At 3 PM, Judge Zhou, along with Assessors Guo and Fan, and Prosecutor Zhang, interrogated Shi in the Criminal Court Three. Lawyer Gu Shouxi appeared in court on behalf of the police station, and lawyer Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Public Security Bureau, represented the case, requesting the extradition of the defendant. The defendant was defended by lawyers Dong Kang and Yuan Jingtang, who opposed the transfer. The court declared the hearing closed to the public because the case involved politics. After the spectators left, the officials interrogated the defendant for an hour. The presiding judge and assessors retired to the resting room for deliberation. After deliberation, they returned to the courtroom and interrogated the defendant again. It was heard that the court ruled that the defendant would be allowed to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau personnel for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Employee Smuggles Foreign Liquor, Discovered</h3>
<p>Ningyun Brandy Tax Evasion, Theft En Route Causes Dispute</p>
<p>The Tangshan Maru ship of the Japanese Qing Company, which came to Shanghai from Dalian via Qingdao, had a case of smuggling foreign liquor which was stolen on board, resulting in the beating of a sailor leader, and triggered a dispute resulting in a report to the water police and the arrest of the ship's compradore, etc. The situation of this matter is reported as follows:</p>
<h3>Dalian Foreign Goods Cheap</h3>
<p>Since our country's customs authorities increased import tax rates, the tax on imported foreign goods in China, especially luxury goods, has been the greatest, with some valued at 100 and taxed at 100, or valued at 100 and taxed at 160. Foreign liquor shipped from France, etc., has seen a large increase in tariffs, and the market price has also soared. Dalian is a free port, and foreign goods can be shipped without paying taxes, and various imported luxury goods are cheaper than in Shanghai. People in Shanghai secretly purchase foreign liquor from Dalian, and also ask crew members to sneak it into Shanghai. Although customs inspections are strict, tax evasion and smuggling into Shanghai often occur.</p>
<h3>Brandy Smuggling</h3>
<p>When the Japanese ship Tangshan Maru last came to Shanghai from Dalian, some of its crew members secretly purchased two dozen bottles of brandy in Dalian. The selling price per bottle was five yuan cheaper than in Shanghai. Where there is great profit, people will compete for it. At that time, the foreign liquor was handed over to the sailor leader of the ship and secretly hidden in the carpenter's room to avoid inspection by the Jianghai Customs. This has always been the case. This time, the two dozen bottles of brandy were also hidden in the carpenter's room, to be taken out after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Theft Causes Anger Towards Sailors</h3>
<p>When the Tangshan Maru arrived in Shanghai this time, they wanted to retrieve the foreign liquor. The sailor leader went to the carpenter's room to retrieve it, but it had suddenly disappeared, having been stolen by someone else. The sailor leader truthfully reported the matter to the relevant crew member. Unexpectedly, the crew member strongly accused the sailor leader of stealing it and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, taking the sailor leader to the police station and treating him like a petty thief, handcuffing him. The crew member also beat the sailor leader severely. After investigation, it was discovered that it was stolen by another sailor, not taken by the sailor leader.</p>
<h3>Reporting Inside Story of Smuggling</h3>
<p>After this incident occurred, the sailor leader felt unjustly arrested and beaten, and was very unhappy. He then went to the Water Police Squad and secretly reported that a certain crew member of the Tangshan Maru ship was specializing in smuggling foreign liquor from Dalian to Shanghai, evading customs duties, and it was not the first time. Each dozen bottles of brandy could earn at least forty or fifty yuan. The foreign liquor stolen on the ship this time was the goods he smuggled himself. After losing it, he falsely accused the innocent of theft and suffered humiliation, etc.</p>
<h3>Summons and Arrest of Compradore</h3>
<p>The Water Police Squad, based on the sailor leader's tip-off, decided to investigate this case. Since the crew member who smuggled the goods belonged to the Tangshan Maru ship's compradore, and the smuggling of foreign liquor and tax evasion was serious, the squad sent several senior police officers to the Japanese Qing Company to summon the compradore and order him to hand over the person who smuggled the foreign liquor. Because the Tangshan Maru ship had already left and the compradore was not in Shanghai, he was not summoned at that time. The matter has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>Detecting and Arresting Bandits in Close Combat</h3>
<p>The Bandit Sun Qi Was Arrested, and Two Women Were Wounded in the Foot by Stray Bullets</p>
<p>At 6:55 PM last night, the Yulin Road Police Station suddenly received a police report stating that bandits were hiding in the Kunming Road Pingchuan Lane of Taopeng Road, intending to commit robbery. The police station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to arrest them, first guarding a certain house and then entering to make the arrest. Unexpectedly, the bandits had already received the news, so when the detectives entered, the bandits all fled through the back door. Only one bandit, named Sun Qi, was arrested on the spot. He confessed that there were about eight or nine accomplices. After learning this, the detectives went out through the back door of the house and chased after the bandits. Seeing the detectives approaching step by step, the bandits became anxious and panicked, and actually drew their guns and opened fire. The detectives also returned fire. After a brief exchange of fire, the bandits were defeated and fled in all directions amidst the dense gunfire, so they were not arrested. The detectives took the bandit they had captured on the spot to the police station for detention and interrogation, and immediately sent detectives to pursue the fleeing bandits. When the detectives were fighting with the bandits, Shen Xu, a 55-year-old woman from Jiangwan, and her 13-year-old granddaughter, Xi Baobao, were cooling off outside the door of a flat, both were hit in the right foot by stray bullets. The detectives discovered this, took them to the Tongren Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Education Department Orders County Education Committees to Exchange Inspections</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to the education bureaus of various counties stating: "The exchange of inspections by county education committee members not only benefits from mutual correction of errors but also prevents favoritism and leniency. This practice is excellent in principle and should be promoted. Therefore, the five articles of the 'Methods for the Exchange of Inspections by Education Committee Members in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province' are hereby promulgated. The heads of each bureau are to abide by them, prepare a plan, report to the department for record, and actively implement it without delay. This order is issued."</p>
<h3>Methods for the Exchange of Inspections by Education Committee Members in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Article 1: Each county education bureau or county government, in order to increase the efficiency of inspections, should implement the exchange of inspections by education committee members. Article 2: The exchange of inspections by education committee members should be conducted once per academic year in principle. Article 3: The head of each county education bureau or county magistrate should submit the exchange inspection plan of the education committee members to the Department of Education for review before the start of each academic year. Article 4: After the education committee members of each county are assigned to exchange inspections by the head of the bureau or the county magistrate, they should immediately comply and must not refuse on any pretext. Article 5: These methods will be implemented after being promulgated by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Orders Education Bureau Heads to Inspect Rural Education</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to the education bureaus of various counties stating: "The head of each county education bureau is responsible for all educational administration in the county and must have a deep understanding of the actual conditions of education in the county. Only then can planning be accurate and measures be effective. It has recently been found that after taking office, the heads of education bureaus in various counties mostly reside in cities and do not have a clear understanding of the actual conditions of rural education. Even when they go to the countryside to inspect, it is usually limited to towns and cities with convenient transportation, and they rarely set foot in remote rural areas. This results in limited exposure and inevitably leads to miscommunication, which greatly hinders the progress of rural education. The Department is aware of this problem and has specially formulated ten articles of the 'Provisional Methods for the Inspection of Rural Education by Heads of Education Bureaus in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province,' which are hereby promulgated and implemented. After receiving this order, the heads of each bureau must comply with the provisions of the methods, decide on the inspection procedures and the number of institutions to be inspected, and personally go to the countryside for inspection without intentional evasion. The results of the inspection should be written into a report and sent to the Department for review. All counties where the bureaus have been abolished should have their responsibilities fulfilled by the county magistrate or the head of the Third Section. It is hoped that after this inspection, rural education can be given equal importance to urban education, develop evenly, and jointly seek progress. This is what is expected. This order is issued."</p>
<h3>Provisional Methods for the Inspection of Rural Education by Heads of Education Bureaus in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Article 1: The head of each county education bureau, in order to understand the actual conditions of education in the county and to urge subordinate personnel to work hard, should implement the inspection of rural education in addition to the inspection of urban education. Article 2: The head of each county education bureau should decide on the number of rural education institutions to be inspected and the number of days for inspection according to the actual conditions of the county and the complexity of the duties. However, at least thirty educational institutions must be inspected each semester, and if the total number of rural education institutions is fifty or less, half of them should be inspected. Article 3: The head of each county education bureau may conduct the inspection of rural education in stages. Article 4: The head of each county education bureau must not notify the institutions to be inspected in advance when inspecting rural education. Article 5: The head of each county education bureau should also strictly examine whether the inspection reports of the county supervisors and education committee members are accurate when inspecting rural education. Article 6: The head of each county education bureau may handle urgent matters that require immediate action according to law during the inspection of rural education and report them to the Department for review. Article 7: The head of each county education bureau should prepare a report after each inspection and submit it to the Department for review. Article 8: The travel expenses of the head of each county education bureau for inspecting rural education may be paid from the education bureau's budget for travel expenses. Article 9: Counties where the bureaus have been abolished should have the inspection carried out by the county magistrate or the head of the Third Section of the county government in accordance with these methods. Article 10: These methods will be implemented after being promulgated by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and reported to the Provincial Government for transfer to the Ministry of Education for record.</p>

Lu Lihua, the current president of the school, believes that the self-built school buildings on Daji Road and the temporary campus on Fangxie Road are insufficient for use, and that the luxurious life in Shanghai is not conducive to physical education students' quiet study. Therefore, she has greatly expanded the school and moved it to a new location on Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, this season. The school buildings are divided into east and west campuses and are quite grand.

<h3>Qingguang Wins Three Consecutive Games</h3>
<p>Yesterday defeated the Youth Association with a score of 42 to 28. Tonight at 7:30 PM, they will face the formidable Qianghua.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Qingguang basketball team has invaded Shanghai with great military prowess. They first defeated Xiaguang with a score of 55 to 23, then defeated Tongji with a score of 51 to 28. Last night, they defeated the Youth Association (i.e., the Shanghai Qingguang team) with a score of 42 to 28, proving themselves invincible. The Youth Association is known for its talented players and has always enjoyed a high reputation, but it was unexpectedly defeated, which was truly beyond expectation. The reason for the Shanghai team's defeat is that they hastily formed the team and lacked training. The National Games are approaching, and the City Games will soon open. It is hoped that the Shanghai athletes will do their best. Tonight at 7:30 PM, Qingguang will face Qianghua at the Basketball Hall. This will be Qingguang's last game in Shanghai. Can Qianghua avenge the Shanghai team?</p>
<p>The situation in the first half of yesterday's game was quite even, and the score was very close. It was difficult to tell who was ahead. After twenty minutes of competition, Qingguang took the lead with a score of 14 to 10. In the second half, Qingguang still had the upper hand. Xian Zhuanghuai made frequent contributions, while Wei Haiqing was monitored by the enemy and had less activity. The Youth Association's lineup was scattered, which inevitably led to losses. As a result, Qingguang scored 42 points, and the Youth Association scored 28 points.</p>
<p>Qingguang Fouls Points Youth Association Fouls Points</p>
<p>Wei Haiqing 2 times 6 points Youth Association 0 times 6 points</p>
<p>Ma Zongqing 1 time 4 points Zheng Zhifang 0 times 0 points</p>
<p>Xian Zhuanghuai 0 times 20 points Tan Zhonghua 1 time 8 points</p>
<p>Li Chunfeng 1 time 2 points Yu Xunzi 1 time 8 points</p>
<p>Zhou Jun 2 times 0 points Liang Guoquan 0 times 6 points</p>
<p>Xi Jialu 1 time 0 points Xia Yushu 0 times 0 points</p>
<p>Tang Shaohua 2 times 10 points Total 2 times 28</p>
<p>Total 9 times 42</p>
<p>First Half Qingguang 14 points Youth Association 10 points</p>
<p>Second Half Qingguang 28 points Youth Association 18 points</p>
<p>Tonight's game against Qianghua is expected to be very intense because Qianghua, formerly known as the Van Huangdu team, is composed of famous athletes who are students and graduates of St. John's University. Their strength should not be underestimated, and there will definitely be a fierce battle. The Qianghua roster is as follows: Chen Xianglong, Lin Zequn, Wu Youliang, Cheng Jingxing, Tao Zuzhi, Zhou Xuexian, Xu Wenkui, Manager Lu Ergong.</p>
<p>Diary of the British Wimbledon World Tennis Championships (9)</p>
<h3>London Special Correspondent: July 6th (Thursday)</h3>
<p>Hoped for a quiet day, but the result was very moving and full of thrills. The weather turned hot again, with strong sunlight and no wind to reduce the heat. The first two courts of the center court, after nine days of competition, have shown wear and tear without a drop of rain, but are still enduring. Today's competition is concentrated in these two main courts, and the audience is full.</p>
<p>The United States can still take comfort. One of the remaining female players, Ms. Jacobs, was defeated by Ms. Round. Mrs. Moody continued to win, defeating Mrs. Cravinger. Cravinger won a total of six games. Sometimes the situation was extremely tense. Barnes is working hard to practice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Moody has become almost a mysterious player. Everyone has doubts. Is Mrs. Moody unwilling to show her true skills, or is her true skill still being held back? Mrs. Moody always mysteriously stays behind the baseline, engaging in long rallies with this slender German woman. At 4-4, Moody served, 30-40. At this time, Cravinger rushed to the net, but unfortunately failed. Moody won the first set 6-4, as if nothing had happened. The second set was divided into two parts. One was long rally duels, with each person concentrating the ball on the other's backhand. The other was Cravinger's high balls and occasional rushes to the net. At the same time, Mrs. Moody also changed her hitting style, using balls that were sometimes close and sometimes far to break the opponent's defense, but she did not succeed. At 4-0, 5-1, Moody served, winning another point to win another set, but one double fault and two net cords gave this game away. Cravinger served to make it 5-3, and another game to end the match. This was not because Moody's performance improved, but because Cravinger was tired and made many mistakes. Although she lost, she still had some glory. It is unknown whether Mrs. Moody intended this, but her confidence never wavered.</p>
<p>Ms. Jacobs and Ms. Round competed in the center court. Jacobs took a 4-1 lead, seemingly about to win the first set, but was almost caught up. She won 6-4. In the second set, Jacobs again took a 3-1 lead. Round lost her serve after a fierce battle. In the next game, Jacobs' serve was better, scoring both times with first serves, but she gradually made mistakes, almost losing her advantage. This was Jacobs' peak performance. Round gradually chased from behind, getting closer and closer, winning two consecutive sets: 6-4 in the second set and 6-2 in the third set.</p>
<p>After a long and fierce battle, this result was obtained. This game was a battle of groundstrokes and slices. Jacobs often stood on the baseline. When her groundstrokes met return shots from different directions, Jacobs' serve was stronger, causing the opponent to touch the net. Her overhead smashes were also good, but lacked solidity, which often led to dangerous situations in the competition.</p>
<p>It was a very strange game, with the wind and waves rising and falling. The full audience was noisy and uncertain. The applause for Jacobs was even surprisingly small. Jacobs became a lonely figure, surrounded by thousands of people hoping for an English victory, fighting for her luck. Moreover, several line calls for Jacobs were extremely bad. Once in the north end, a groundstroke inside the white line was called out. Jacobs questioned it, and the linesman changed it, but the protester lost the point. Several times after that, this same linesman made mistakes. Jacobs was deprived of important points.</p>
<p>In the second set, Round took a 4-3 lead by winning the opponent's serve. Then came the longest and most monotonous rally. Jacobs often reached deuce in each game and failed. Round used the opponent's mistakes to make it 5-3, served, and won 6-4. Thus, each won a set.</p>
<p>The fifth game of the third set was the key. Round won one game, and the victory or defeat was decided. Round did not change her strategy, gradually making the opponent fall into decline, and then eliminated her 6-3.</p>
<p>Round was a well-deserved winner. She was often disappointed by opportunities, but Round remained calm. Even when the situation became worse, her serve, although weak, was not something Jacobs could win. Her breaking the opponent's serve turned the tide. As for the audience's view, there is hope for the emergence of an English champion in the future.</p>
<p>In other matches, there were also surprises. Pan Lesus lost to Sato Buichi in five sets. This match was the best doubles match ever seen at Wimbledon this year. Once, all four people were in a mess. Sato was the best, often sending the ball into unexpected positions and hitting it with fierce force. Buichi was not far behind. Pan was sometimes good and sometimes bad. Hughes was the worst. He had not been seen playing well since defeating Sed.</p>
<p>Boro Kutrabruning almost suffered a setback. Kuper Faguasheng took the first two sets, but Bao gradually recovered, winning the next three sets in a row. Bruning's overall performance was reliable. Faguasheng's performance declined in the second set, and his shots lacked purpose. Kuper was mysterious. His hitting style was first-rate. His charge after the serve was very effective. His volleys and overhead smashes left the opponent helpless, but the number of his mistakes was also surprisingly high.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pittman and Ms. Litrey won against Ms. Nat Hall and Mrs. Hiddings Dock. Their tactics were all-encompassing. Pitt and Lit took the lead in the first set but lost it. They also failed in the second set, but swept through the third set.</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles Championship Team: German Klamm (right) and Mrs. Cravinger (left)</p>
<p>In mixed doubles, Mrs. Godfrey and Kingsley's stability and judgment defeated Mrs. Moody and Hughes. Cravinger and Klamm defeated Lan Yingnv and Mann, both in straight sets. Near dusk, Ms. Hillan and Faguasheng won against Mrs. Hiddings Dock and Kerhien in the center court. Kerhien's shorts attracted attention. Hiddings Dock was completely overshadowed. After losing the first set, Hillan and Faha concentrated their efforts and took the next two sets in a row.</p>

<h3>World Tennis Queen Mrs. Moody Seriously Ill</h3>
<p>Hospitalized for a month, canceling West Coast competitions, abandoning the finals. The truth came to light today.</p>
<p>(San Francisco, September 4th, Associated Press) The reason why world tennis queen Mrs. Moody abandoned the All-American Women's Singles Tournament a week ago to Ms. Jacobs came to light today after an X-ray examination at Stanford University Hospital. It turned out that Mrs. Moody's back was very ill when she left the court, and she could not support it. Her father, Dr. Whiel, ordered his beloved daughter to stay in the hospital for at least a month, and said, "Helen (i.e., Mrs. Moody) should not participate in the Linshan Tournament. If she insists on continuing in the finals, the consequences will be even more unimaginable." After this complete recovery, she should rest for six months after being discharged from the hospital before she can take the racket and enter the court again. As for Mrs. Moody's performance matches scheduled on the West Coast, they have all been canceled. Her father also forbade her to be a spectator to avoid nervous shock.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Only Diligence Can Lead to Wealth</h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>In our Suzhou countryside, there are a few ballad-style sayings: "The first generation works hard to create wealth (pronounced in the departing tone, meaning to acquire property). The second generation enjoys, the third generation begs for food." This means that the father is diligent and thrifty, starting a family from scratch. The son then develops into a young master, selling and eating, enjoying life. By the time it reaches the grandson's hands, the property acquired by the first generation has already been sold and eaten up by the second generation, and the grandson has been used to enjoying himself since childhood, becoming lazy by nature. Therefore, he has no choice but to become a beggar. How profound and insightful are these few folk sayings.</p>
<p>Before the collapse of Imperial Russia, the privileged life of the royal family was known to everyone. They did not shed a single drop of sweat every day, but lived a life of extravagance. However, after the revolution, they were at a dead end. Under the revolutionary slogan of "He who does not work, neither shall he eat," these royal family members, who had lived a life of "unearned income" since birth, had no choice but to flee abroad in panic. On Avenue Joffre, North Sichuan Road, and the Hongkou area of Shanghai, we can often see White Russian wanderers raising their right hands in salute to pedestrians and extending their left hands to beg for money, practicing their "begging for food" lifestyle.</p>
<p>The most hopeless thing is being gluttonous and lazy. In this era of rampant human desires, who doesn't want "unearned income"? Even if a family hires a maid, she will ask how much "extra money" she can make a month as soon as she enters the door. Clerks helping the boss with business are constantly thinking about increasing wages and reducing working hours. Although they cannot achieve the level of unearned income, they must at least achieve the step of doing less work and getting more rewards, thinking about getting rich without being diligent. Haha, there is no such cheap thing in the world.</p>
<p>U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt recently gave a broadcast speech saying that unearned income not only destroys oneself, but also destroys the country. Perfect and secure compensation comes only from faithful work." The United States, which has always advocated "less work, more pay," is now, in this recession, also advocating China's ancient teachings and the "diligence" that young people of the times find headache-inducing. It can be seen that the only way to seek "wealth" is through "diligence." If you are unwilling to be "diligent," the father's property can indeed be "enjoyed" by the son, but by the son's son, he will not be able to hold on to it.</p>
<h3>Swimming</h3>
<p>— Xia Tianwu</p>
<p>In the sultry summer, the most suitable and enjoyable sport is swimming. Lightly patting the clear waves, floating on the water's surface, limbs relaxed, heart and mind at ease, under the scorching sun, this is the only pleasure.</p>
<p>Swimming is not only a pleasure but also very beneficial; because swimming requires the balanced use of all the body's functions, unlike other sports, which tend to emphasize certain parts of the body.</p>
<p>There are two legitimate explanations for swimming in academic terms: In biology, it is said that humans evolved from lower animals, so in the early embryonic stage, humans lived in water like lower animals, and then gradually moved to land through amphibious life. Therefore, humans have an instinctive ability to swim.</p>
<p>According to physics, the mass of the human body is lighter than that of water, so the weight occupied by a person lying on the water level will not exceed the weight of the same volume of water. Therefore, a person thrown into the water will never sink immediately like a stone. This proves that swimming is suitable and possible for everyone.</p>
<p>However, what we often hear is, "Ah, swimming is dangerous. Don't risk making this dangerous attempt!" Indeed, every year, several lives are sacrificed for swimming. This year, we have already seen in the newspapers that many people have given up their lives for swimming.</p>
<p>The danger of swimming arises from a combination of recklessness and lack of attention to detail, and inadequate facilities at the swimming venue. But, should we stop eating for fear of choking?</p>
<p>Chuanchun Baimura's "Ten Lectures on Literature" says, "...Some types of pine shoots are poisonous... But, instead of prohibiting the consumption of pine shoots for fear of poisoning, it is better to study the nature of pine shoots. Why are they poisonous? So that everyone knows..." Although this is about literature! To address the danger of swimming, we should also study and consider this idea.</p>
<p>Therefore, to advocate for those who love swimming, in addition to admonishing individuals to be bold but careful, the major premise is that the swimming venue should have good facilities.</p>
<h3>The Era of Insects</h3>
<p>— Shen Shou Ruo</p>
<p>The firefly is the true star of the era; because it can provide light in the darkness, preventing people from getting lost.</p>
<p>The mosquito is the sole imperialist of the era; because its policy of aggression proceeds by taking advantage of people's unawareness.</p>
<p>The cicada is the faithful propagandist of the era; because although it is singing loudly about saving the country! Saving the country! Its heart is very pure.</p>
<p>The cricket is the practitioner of industry in the era; because even in the deep night, the sound of its weaving machine never ceases.</p>
<h3>Hitting</h3>
<p>— Xue Jiu</p>
<p>Some people say that Chinese people have never liked to fight. However, didn't the 19th Route Army fight for dozens of days during the January 28th Incident? Between the Black Water and White Mountains, aren't there still volunteer troops fighting there? If not, please readers check how many civil wars have been fought in the past 22 years. Those who have eaten dinner and go for a walk on the street will surely see many "hitting" dramas. For example, Little Sanzi ate a piece of candy that A Mao stole from his mother to buy, and patted A Mao's deflated little leather ball once or twice, then, with "utmost dedication and no hesitation," he fought with his enemy, Da Niu Zi. Da Niu Zi, on the other hand, like Mencius's three thousand retainers, "recruited soldiers and bought horses," gathered a group of fighters, and prepared to brawl. They hit each other without end. If their mothers found out, they would lightly use the Jiangbei dialect to scold, indirectly criticizing the matter; or, more seriously, spank their bottoms. There are also children who get slapped on the palms for speaking indiscreetly. In schools, there are students who spend their days playing ball. Grandmothers have nothing to do on their days off, so they play mahjong. Modern youths, after eating, play billiards. There are also those who break out into fights over tea gatherings, brawls caused by "disobedience," and gangsters splitting the spoils. Petty thieves get caught, and failing to agree on a price causes a rickshaw puller to tear a long gown. All these situations cannot avoid hitting. From this, it can be seen that hitting occurs almost every day, and everyone likes to hit. Don't mention anything else, even our general who has never liked to fight, doesn't he love to play golf? However, this "hit" is not that "hit," but they are both "hit" in essence!</p>
<p>Who says Chinese people have never liked to fight?</p>
<h3>Is Suzhou Going to Have Automobiles?</h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Suzhou is a place of scenic mountains and rivers. Most of the scenic areas are scattered in the southwest and are quite far apart. For example, the plum blossoms of Dengwei Mountain, which are renowned, can only be appreciated by the propertied class in spring, who speed there by motorboats, which costs a lot. Ordinary people stay where they are. In addition, places like Tianping and Lingyan are relics of the past, making people very nostalgic. Unfortunately, they are too far from the city. Although one can take a boat or ride a donkey, at least it makes people rush, unable to enjoy themselves fully. If Tianping, Lingyan, Dengwei, and Stone Lake could all be accessible by automobile, it would be more convenient for people from other places.</p>
<p>In my opinion, instead of having automobiles in the city, it would be better to have automobiles running to the scenic areas as soon as possible, making it convenient for tourists, and allowing farmers to sell their local products, thus boosting the rural economy. We only need to look at Wuxi's methods. Automobiles have been running to places like Huishan and Meiyuan for many years. I think Huishan's local products can be sold more easily, and at the same time, it stimulates tourists' interest.</p>
<p>In Suzhou, it seems that automobiles would be better in the countryside than in the city. If automobiles run in the city, it would only be showing off in Jingde Road and Hulong Street, making people envious of you. It would be better to open up several scenic area avenues.</p>
<p>Suzhou people have too narrow a vision, only knowing how to show off on the streets, not thinking about the scenic areas. One should know that in this time of rural economic bankruptcy, having automobiles run in scenic areas would not be a bad way to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Difficulty in Finding a Spouse, Lingering Worries About the Future; Small Gathering with Friends, Shameless Memories of the Past. Zhao Ziqiang finally understood that this small gathering today was also approved by Gui Zhi. He smiled and said, "It's a limited matter, why talk about being unwilling!" Man Ying said, "Listen, the host is willing, why don't you just have a bowl?" Gui Zhi had nothing to say, only smiled slightly. After a while, the waiter brought the tea soup. Gui Zhi used a small teaspoon to scoop up the tea soup, and suddenly a thought came to her mind. She was thinking, wasn't it in this room that she made the three-year secret agreement with Gan Jizhi? Those sweet words that she secretly said to him in those days eventually came to naught. If it had been like this time, with people arranging things and with family permission, there would not have been that kind of situation later. But then again, a family like Gan Jizhi's, so full of officialdom, would never have condescended to her like this. And Zhao Ziqiang is always very dedicated. Because his mother and daughter are a little dissatisfied with soldiers, he is willing to resign as company commander. But Gan Er Ye is the opposite, preferring to lose love in order to keep his job. Looking at it this way, soldiers are better after all; educated people are unreliable. Thinking of this, her face turned red. Tian Qing and Gui Zhi were sitting diagonally across from each other, and when he saw that her face was red, all the way to her neck, he nudged Man Ying. Man Ying understood and turned to Gui Cun and said, "Why don't you say something! Why are you always lowering your head and drinking tea soup?" Gui Zhi kept scraping the edge of the bowl with a small copper spoon, saying nothing, and her shoulders kept shrugging as she smiled, just keeping her head down. Tian Qing said, "Company Commander Zhao should speak first. In the case of female guests, the opening is always later." (179)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>The Most Humorous Home Education</h3>
<p>— Jin Zi</p>
<p>This is a friend's story. Of course, he himself is very much against me publishing it, so his name can only be omitted. He is an engineer who has been abroad. However, his specialty is not in drawing and drafting. He has a particularly clear mind and a particularly ingenious mind, which are beyond the reach of ordinary people. Just talking about the education he gives his children is enough to shock ordinary people. And it's extremely humorous. He had a son whose actual age five years ago was exactly twenty-one years old. At that time, he was still studying at XX University. He was very lively by nature, and after being seduced by a few bad classmates, he started practicing dancing, step by step, and quickly stood in the ranks of Shanghai's average university students, implementing a romantic life with the school as the communication address. Soon, these situations were known to my friend. That day, he rushed to a certain school to bring his son back and formally declared his withdrawal from school to the school authorities. At that time, I was living in the same place as him, and I got the news and hurried over to see him, intending to mediate between their father and son. Unexpectedly, upon entering the house, I saw that both of them were full of smiles. The father didn't seem to be giving any lectures, and the son didn't seem to have any worries. This confused me. Lao Zhang - my friend - kept talking nonsense to me, not letting me have a chance to interrupt and ask questions. Later, when his son went to another room, he leaned close to me and asked:</p>
<p>"Have you been continuing the work of prostitution with Lao Wang recently?" This question was a big surprise to me. Of course, I was anxious to ask him why he asked this question, but he gave me a very solemn, very thorough, and very novel explanation.</p>
<p>His reason was that the university is paying too little attention to discipline. Most of the students are living an extremely romantic life, so sending a young man with strong blood into it, expecting him not to be assimilated, is really an extremely unreasonable delusion. As for romantic methods, he believes that brothels are the most suitable, and they are a truly crash course. Therefore, that day, he repeatedly begged me to take the opportunity to lure his son to Xiaohuayuan and Huileli to take a walk. At first, I didn't dare to take on the task, but later he further explained his intention to me. He said:</p>
<p>"What is prostitution? We can compare it to typhoid fever among various diseases. This disease is certainly very dangerous, but after this disease, the wind, cold, heat, and toxins that you usually suffer from can all be swept away and evaporated. As long as you take good care of yourself after the illness, this person has no hope of never getting sick again. You can gamble in the brothel if you want to gamble, smoke opium if you want to smoke opium, and you can take someone out to dance immediately. If you want to solve sexual hunger, you just need to spend money. There is no reason why it cannot be done. In short, all temptations containing toxic substances, you can let them surround you at the same time; and the most powerful part of it is, of course, women; the women in the brothel are always hypocritical and cannot last. One day you will be able to discover their hypocrisy, and at the same time, you will immediately abandon all enjoyment. By that time, your body will be strong, and even if you enter a maze of towers and palaces, you will not be moved! Then teach him to study again, and this study will truly enter his stomach!"</p>
<p>I was so moved by what he said that I followed him and pretended to be foolish and led his son onto the road of prostitution. For the first nine months, this young man was really like a madman, indulging and reveling, thinking of ways to spend money and seek pleasure all day long, as if he had forgotten everything else. Later, I gradually saw that he was not very interested anymore. Finally, on a certain night, he burst into tears in front of his father. At this time, he had realized that no matter what enjoyment or pleasure is, it is all false and temporary. He had deeply abandoned it! From the second semester, he continued to study at school. As a result, he was always the first in every exam and became an extremely excellent young man, but he himself still doesn't know that this is the success of his father's most humorous home education!</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Prices Fall Amid National Crisis; Winning Bids Down 11.8 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday showed no movement in foreign exchange rates, with British silver, American silver, American cotton, American wheat, and American and British stocks all flat. However, American and British exchange rates suddenly increased by 0.7375. In addition, the hope for a British and American exchange rate agreement has faded, and there are policies for Britain to devalue the pound and cancel the British-French exchange rate balancing fund. This poses a great danger to the French gold standard, which relies on the stability of the British pound. It is said that the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and other countries will also be swept into the vortex. People's hearts seemed timid. The initial price for raw gold was 223 yuan. Hengxing then sold, breaking the 20 yuan mark. After the opening, the price further declined due to the loosening of the exchange market. Afterward, banks took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, but most covered long positions with short positions, so the gold price rose but mostly stabilized, hovering around.

<p>The Yang拆 [Foreign Call Loan] is One Point Higher</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yang拆 [Foreign Call Loan] price was 0.09 in both the morning and afternoon markets, one point higher than the previous day. The situation indeed showed increasing prosperity. Because the supply of 劃頭加水 [overdrafts] still exceeded demand, the trading price was only 0.02 to 0.03. The transaction volume of discount notes was over 4.8 million in the morning market, with over 900,000 in new transactions and over 600,000 in the afternoon market.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Trading Almost Nonexistent</h3>
<p>The market continues to show softening, falling by 0.05 to 0.35 yuan. Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange's market remained depressed. The situation showed signs of gradual decline. The market atmosphere was very sluggish. In addition, the unrest in Fujian Province continued to be rampant, making people feel even more nervous and uneasy. There were also rumors that there was no arrangement for the 96 bonds, so there were even fewer traders in the market. Buying and selling was almost nonexistent. Large investors did not enter or exit, and retail investors were not enthusiastic. Therefore, the trading volume remained stagnant. The two morning sessions did not show much fluctuation, but they were both weak. Because the trading volume was small, it did not attract much attention. The afternoon market was even more chaotic. Although there were slight differences in the rise and fall, the overall trend was still disheartening. The closing prices for various bonds were still slightly down. The 4th bonds were sold slightly, so the market price ultimately did not improve. Based on the current trend, the future situation is expected to continue to decline. The market price yesterday fell by 0.05 to 0.35 yuan. The trend has become simple. The total transaction volume was 3,832,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in cash. The futures included 1,685,000 for Salt Tax, 490,000 for Disarmament, 195,000 for 19 Customs Revenue, 685,000 for 20 Customs Revenue, and 550,000 for 96. The rest were only tens of thousands.</p>
<h3>The Sale of Yarn: South China Purchases Are Relatively Strong</h3>
<p>The number of buyers for standard yarn is few, with a slightly bearish trend. The yarn market is trending weak, with a slight softening due to the decline in the cotton market, causing the yarn market to fall. However, sales of current yarn are relatively high, and purchases in the South China region are smooth and robust. Therefore, some people are optimistic about prices. However, sellers are still unwilling to reduce their holdings significantly due to large inventories. The future trend will still depend on actual demand.</p>
<h3>Cotton Futures Fall by Six to Eight Cents</h3>
<p>The cotton futures market opened with a very flat atmosphere, with few buyers. Prices for all months fell by five, seven, eight, and nine cents to one dollar. In the afternoon, news of a hurricane in the southern port of the United States caused sentiment to suddenly strengthen, with prices for all months rising slightly by one or two cents.

<h3>Ningbo Traders Massively Sell Cotton Futures to Hedge</h3>
<p>The market was initially weak due to news of a hurricane in the southern port of the United States, then rebounded slightly. The cotton market first fell and then rose. However, the Ningbo traders, facing a surge of Yao cotton on the market and sluggish sales, sold large amounts of cotton futures in Shanghai to hedge. Shanghai traders bought on the dip. Some traders sold off their holdings due to clear weather. However, afternoon news from Reuters reported a hurricane in the southern port of the United States, which is the most important cotton-growing region. There are fears that cotton burning will lead to rising prices tomorrow, so speculators actively bought.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Futures Weak</h3>

<h3>Grains: South Port Rice Declines Alone</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over forty sources. Wholesale and retail demand was still good, and the market situation turned flat, but the situation is still difficult to determine. The prices of Changbang, Sutongbang and other japonica rice, as well as Chenxin Duyangjian, remained unchanged. The prices of various Bangbao rice also remained the same, with a total demand of more than 2,000 bags, all destined for North Port. As for South Port thick rice, which had previously been firm due to lack of supply, it suddenly declined as supply increased slightly yesterday, turning into a flat price in silver dollars. He Xia's new japonica rice suddenly fell by two or three corners due to weather conditions, and Changdong's new rice also fell by two corners, with a price of 7 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were approximately thirty sources from various routes in He Xia. The market was sluggish, and the price of white japonica rice was slightly down by one or two corners, while the price of thin rice was slightly down by one corner. The price of Bianyuan Xintuanjian was also slightly down by nearly one corner, and the price of Dongxin japonica rice was also slightly down by two corners. The prices of new and old Yangjian, Chen Dujian, Xinke Jian, and Xinling White Jian were weak.</p>
<h3>Early Batch of New Jiangxi Rice Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>156 bags, unrefined rice, Yong trade continues to be active, and the market is standing firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, new Ke Xian rice continued to arrive, and the appetite in Fujian and Zhejiang improved, the market stabilized, and the price of high-quality goods rebounded slightly. The arrival of new Nanjing machine rice was even stronger. Yesterday, the Fuzhou and Quanzhou traders from Fujian province completed the purchase of 2,000 bags, with prices ranging from 6 yuan 3 jiao and a half to 3 jiao. The middle and second grade rice were priced at 6 yuan 2 jiao and a half to 1 jiao 2 fen, and the second grade rice was priced at 5 yuan 7 jiao. Hunan Jijing also purchased 156 bags from Quanzhou, priced at 5 yuan 5 jiao 2 fen. In addition to Yong's smooth purchase of foreign rice, 160 bags of late Jiangxi old machine rice were purchased, priced at 7 yuan 3 jiao 7 fen, which was 5 fen lower than the previous week.</p>
<p>The inventory of Jiangxi old rice in Shanghai is also low, with more than 2,000 bags still in the hands of hoarders. Due to the small amount of inventory, the market is stable. Therefore, it was not significantly affected by the sharp drop in the price of new rice. Early rice of new Jiangxi rice has also been launched, but there is no profit for porters. The first batch of new machine early rice arrived yesterday with 156 bags. The owner quoted 6 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen due to the high cost, and the buyer only offered 6 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen, a difference of half a yuan, so no agreement was reached.</p>
<p>After the Yong traders repeatedly loaded foreign rice, the market has stabilized. The small twist purchased by Yong traders a few days ago can still be transferred. Yesterday, another 3,000 bags were purchased, with the price still at 6 yuan 7 jiao and a half. The market was originally bearish, but due to the strong Yong trade, it temporarily stabilized. Saigon No. 1 rice was also expected to soften, but it was stabilized by the small twist. Yesterday, 200 bags were purchased from this street, priced at 7 yuan 7 jiao and a half. Although the goods are better, the price is one corner higher than the previous market, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Factories Continue to Dump Futures</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices in each month showed a pattern of first flattening and then falling sharply. Since there was still no quotation for foreign wheat, the market was initially stable. Later, major factories, such as Fuxin, Fufeng, and Xinda, continued to sell, which greatly impacted sentiment in the near and distant future. The current sales are extremely sluggish. In the past few days of last week, there were still some shipments from the north, but after the market became slightly better, it became silent again. Originally, sales of current mooncakes should be strong, but in fact, the factories have not sold much. This situation is due to the fact that the rural economy has not yet recovered, so the flour market has been constantly sluggish. As a result, the price for this month fell by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, and prices for October to January fell by 3 fen each, and the price for February fell by 2.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Initially Stable, Ultimately Decline</h3>
<p>After the wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices for each month showed a pattern of initial stability followed by a decline. Since there was no quotation for foreign wheat, the market was inevitably stable. However, since flour sales were not improving, factories were generally indifferent to standard wheat, with no intention of buying. Some factories were even selling wheat futures to hedge. Therefore, although the outside market was strong, it could not reverse the situation. In addition, news of changes in wheat borrowing arrangements meant there would be many changes in the future given the oversupply of flour and wheat. As a result, the price for this month fell by 4 fen compared to the previous day, the price for October fell by 5 fen, the price for November fell by 3 fen, the price for December fell by 2 fen, and the price for January fell by 3 fen. The current wheat market is again trending towards sluggishness. Since flour and wheat futures have become sluggish again, opening prices will have to be cut. In addition, a portion of the wheat in the warehouses was damaged by water due to the storms, making it difficult to sell for a time. It is said that only 500 bags of Yangzhou wheat were offered, and the price is unknown.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse and White Sugar Fall Back by One Corner</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market turned weak as the gold standard and customs duties were small, and the Dutch exchange rate also contracted. The association's pan for 24 coarse white sugar, ordinary goods, was 21 yuan 6 jiao, a discount of one corner from the previous day. There were no transactions for the 20 Zhongsha white. The Dutch PK Mark was set at 16 yuan 8 jiao and a half, a discount of one corner from the previous day. Taigu sugar B Mark was down 5 fen, and set at 21 yuan 9 jiao. The Hong Kong Yuen Yong Dutch Qing opened at 17 yuan. Chao traders opened Chao Qing for a total of 400 bags or so, with Zhuangqing goods opening at 16 yuan due to scarcity. Huanggang Qing was 15 yuan 6 jiao to 4 jiao, and Gao Bannan Qing was 14 yuan 8 jiao, the next best was 14 yuan 6 jiao to 3 jiao. A small amount of Gao Mian Chi was shipped in, and the number square called 17 yuan 8 jiao, but no transaction had been made. Shinyi opened up two thousand bags or so of Chepad wheel route goods of eight and nine Dutch Chi with price being sixteen yuan and six jiao.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: White Lotus Plummets, Slightly Rebounds</h3>
<p>Previously, white lotus sales were sluggish and shipments from the origin gradually increased, so the local price rose from more than 40 yuan to 30 yuan, and the Shanghai market also fell from 45 to 46 yuan to 36 yuan. The intensity of the decline was unprecedented. However, this price was indeed low, so Shanghai traders went to purchase, and the market situation slightly changed. Yesterday, according to Lanxi news, it had risen by 2 yuan, and here it also rose to 38 yuan. It can be said to be a big fall and a small rebound.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Hangzhou Autumn Dry Cocoons Seen</h3>
<p>Wuxi Autumn Cocoons on the Market: The autumn silkworms in the four villages are about half a month apart. Early silkworms have been on the market, and about 30 cocoon merchants have reported their prices. The arrival of goods in the market is still not weak. The highest cocoon price is 35 yuan, and the lowest is 28 yuan. Cocoon merchants do not accept inferior cocoons.</p>
<p>Chang'an Sample Cocoons Shipped to Shanghai: New autumn cocoons have been on the market for many days. The fresh cocoons collected by cocoon merchants are now being processed. Yesterday morning, 135 bags of autumn dry cocoon samples were shipped to Shanghai from Chang'an Station. This is a cargo of the public record and has been sent to the factory for trial reeling to see the size of the reeling discount.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchant Silk Sales Are Depressed: The New York market's raw silk factory sales have not changed, and prices are difficult to rise. The Lyon market's treasure sales continue to be sluggish. Overseas silk telegrams showed no change yesterday, and silk sales remain depressed. Yesterday, only Dachang and others imported 15 bags of yellow and white factory silks, and the price remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Lu Zhuang's Fine Eyebrows Continue to Sell Well in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign merchants' tea market, the tea merchants of Lu Zhuang's Zhenmei green tea, Jinlong, Xiehe, Tongfu, and Yongxing, saw the shortage of supplies from the mainland and the low tea prices, and their willingness to import continued to be strong. The total transaction volume of green tea in various routes in the city was more than 4,700 boxes, with Zhenmei accounting for about six or seven tenths. Wuyuan Gao Zhuang's core-pulling goods were opened at 205 yuan, and the selling prices were unchanged from before. The market for low-grade goods such as Zhenmei and Xiumei fell by 3 to 4 yuan compared to before. In addition, the market for large-scale goods was also quite sluggish.</p>

<h3>Business Experience (38): Talking About the Cheap "Almonds"</h3>
<p>Almonds are produced in Tianjin and other places, and there are two types: sweet and bitter. Sweet almonds are sweet and fragrant, while bitter almonds are very bitter and also fragrant. Both have the effect of relieving coughs and reducing phlegm. However, sweet almonds can also be used as ordinary food, while bitter almonds are exclusively for medicinal purposes. The various forms are briefly described below for discussion:</p>
<p>1.  White Jade Flat: The grains are flat, wide, and large, white in color, and have a sweet and fragrant taste.</p>
<p>2.  Dragon King Hat: The grains are large, flat, wide, pointed, red in color, dry, and have a sweet and fragrant taste.</p>
<p>3.  Kuang Almond: The grains are flat, thick, and small, white in color, slightly red, dry, and have a sweet and fragrant taste.</p>
<p>4.  Suit Flat: The grains are medium-sized, yellow in color, dry, and have a sweet and fragrant taste.</p>
<p>5.  Beishan Almond: The grains are flat, round, red in color, dry, and have a sweet and fragrant taste.</p>
<p>6.  Nine-Dao Eyebrow: The grains are of varying sizes, flat and round, slightly red in color, dry, and have a sweet and fragrant taste. Slightly bitter.</p>
<p>7.  Bitter Almond: The grains are thin, small, pointed, and round, red in color, dry, and have an extremely bitter and fragrant taste.</p>
<p>Sweet almonds can be stir-fried until hot, crispy, and delicious, or stir-fried with salt water to make "焦鹽杏仁 (Salted Almonds)." Alternatively, they can be stir-fried until cooked, peeled, and then made with white sugar to make "杏仁糖 (Almond Candy)." Or, they can be soaked in water, ground extremely finely, strained with a fine cloth to remove the dregs, boiled with water, and then added with white sugar to make "杏仁湯 (Almond Soup)." If you want a thick juice, you can add a little water chestnut powder before cooking. Other 禚餅 and empty foods also require occasional use. In addition to medicinal needs, bitter almonds are also used as a raw material for almond 　 and almond extract sold on the market.</p>

<h3>The Tragedy of Errors</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>The Comedy of Errors is the name of a less-known play by Shakespeare. This comedy stems from the almost identical faces of two sets of twin brothers: two masters and their servant twins.</p>
<p>Error is originally a manifestation of spiritual inadequacy that we cannot avoid in our daily lives. Therefore, the components of comedy inevitably have to rely on this. However, social events in which errors are deliberately created as a result of tragedy, or in which tragedy occurs as a result of errors, are actually quite numerous in today's world, where things are becoming increasingly complicated. For example, the chalked cross on the door in the story of Ali Baba from One Thousand and One Nights, or the body in the box in Stevenson's novel The Wrong Box, are all kinds of laugh-out-loud errors, but their seriousness is enough to constitute a tragedy. To give a few of the most common daily examples: if an old man in the countryside marries a new bride, and when the woman's family is selecting a partner, they ask a fair-faced scholar to take his place; or if a submission is rejected and a female author's photo and name are used to confound the editor's mind, and so on.</p>
<p>To use a recent current event as an analogy, there are also many cases where people are caught up in suspicion, arrested, and forced to suffer greatly because of the similarity of their names or their unusual mental state. As for the Yellow River floods, the excuses and lawsuits of local officials who are not dedicated to river works and water administration, blaming each other for errors, and not encouraging themselves to take responsibility, are even more laughable and lamentable social misfortunes. No wonder the State Council's civil service office has issued an order to forget and confuse the names of committee members.</p>
<h3>Chang Gui (Vampire)</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>This time, the Chang Gui is really a bit drunk! He ate it all down, those two fat, white thighs, a bright red heart, so tempting, he ate it all.</p>
<p>The wine isn't finished yet, but he's drunk. No strength! He looks at the tiger, that muddlehead, dozing off. What a good nap, muddlehead! The Chang Gui laughed.</p>
<p>He laughs at this majestic tiger, so useless! If it weren't for him leading the tiger to where there are people, if it weren't for him tricking people into taking off their clothes, the tiger's majesty would be useless! This majesty is the Chang Gui's. How proud!</p>
<p>The Chang Gui was also a person before, but now, he has no humanity at all! He relies on the tiger, and also plays with the tiger. He accompanies the tiger to eat people, people, he was also a person before!</p>
<p>But he eats people of the same kind.</p>
<p>He puts the fat ones into his own belly; those that go into the tiger's mouth are all thin, weak ones. But this muddlehead is completely in the dark. Look at that sleeping face, so stupid!</p>
<p>The Chang Gui laughed again with pride.</p>
<p>Stirring the mountain wind and the forest, the tiger turned on its side. This time, the Chang Gui was almost frightened to death. He must not wake up! At this time, he must not wake up no matter what! If he wakes up and can't find those fat, white thighs, that bright red heart, that would be terrible!</p>
<p>Smelling the wine, the tiger finally woke up. Unable to find those fat, white thighs, that bright red heart, he roared, furiously.</p>
<p>Behind the tiger, the Chang Gui trembled, the wine was startled out of him!</p>
<p>Discovering that the smell of wine was on the Chang Gui, the tiger asked sternly.</p>
<p>The Chang Gui was clever after all, he replied. He said that a mountain goat from the back ridge, while the king was sleeping, got him drunk with wine: and secretly ran off with the thighs and heart.</p>
<p>The tiger was so angry that it raised its tail.</p>
<p>Goats don't eat people, but the tiger doesn't remember.</p>
<p>He caught the goat. In the world of beasts, there is no law, nor is there any need for a trial. Without a word of defense, the goat was done for!</p>
<p>The tiger was still angry.</p>
<p>Behind the rock, the Chang Gui clutched his belly, laughing secretly.</p>
<h3>Taoist Ritual</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengqie</p>
<p>It's time for the Taoist ritual again. In the wilderness, according to the four directions of east, south, west, and north, one bamboo pole is erected in each direction, and forty-nine paper lanterns are hung in a row on top of the bamboo poles. The people of the village all left their homes and crowded to the place where the Taoist ritual was being performed to watch. The altar was set up on an open space, made up of four or five tables. The top was supplied with incense, flowers, fruit, and seven or eight Taoists lined up on both sides like wild geese, with one wearing a priest's costume in the middle, sincerely and fearfully communicating the prayer.</p>
<p>The spectators sat around the altar. Long and short benches of varying heights were brought by each person. The old people lowered their heads, listening to the voices coming from the altar, and sometimes raised their heads to look at the altar once or twice, their eyes full of piety. The hearts of the young people were mostly not on the altar, and the charming eyes of some young girls were attracting them, making them a little drunk. Some of the children leaned in their mothers' arms, staring at the fruit offered on top of the altar with their small eyes, while others ran around the circle restlessly.</p>
<p>The moon hung in the sky, bright, clear and clean. A gust of wind blew from the wilderness, and the light of the candles on the altar flickered erratically. From time to time, the chirping of insects came from the surroundings, intermittent and very sad. Suddenly, a burst of rapid bell sounds erupted from the altar, and the sounds of various musical instruments echoed along with it, causing people to suddenly feel extremely tense.</p>
<p>Then, some people remembered their unfortunate fate: children who died in the plague, failed silkworm cocoons, and agricultural products whose prices had fallen... Their eyes were all a little wet.</p>
<p>During the Taoists' short break, the old people talked incessantly, and although there were not many days left, they still had hopes and pessimism about life. Only those young people were optimistic, chasing after several girls who were going home, singing seductive love songs in the silver moonlight.</p>
<p>Fewer and fewer people were around the altar. The sounds of the musical instruments on the altar erupted again rapidly. The Taoists continued to go to the altar to do the unfinished work. But no one was paying attention. All the remaining people closed their eyes and dozed off on the benches. Sometimes, even if a few people were stimulated by the sound and opened their eyes to look at the altar, they soon closed their eyes again.</p>
<p>The hazy seventh-month night, like a light mist, enveloped these people equally...</p>
<h3>The Ideal Figure of a Writer</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, three Chinese translations of "Sanine" appeared; however, no matter how you look at it, "Sanine" is not a good book.</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian diplomat Vatslav Vorovsky, who died at a conference table in Geneva, once wrote a harsh critique under the title "Bazarov and Sanine" about the book "Sanine" and the character within. A certain passage is essential to quote:</p>
<p>"......As an artist, Artsybashev is not comparable to Turgenev, nor would he consider himself on par with Turgenev. Even considering the clarity of form and artistry, the difference in talent between the two is undeniably evident, and this difference is reflected in the universality of their creation." To compare Artsybashev's "Sanine" in terms of artistic value to Turgenev's masterpiece is naturally far too disparate. As an artist, Artsybashev is probably in the ranks of second- or third-rate writers. Throughout the four or five hundred pages of "Sanine," the scenes, the structure of the story, the style of the characters, in short, the author's creative power, consistently reveal substantial weakness.</p>
<p>But what I want to discuss here is the character of Sanine. He is not a historical archetype; he is entirely a product of artistic fantasy, namely, the author's ideal figure. And this ideal figure is half due to the weakness of the author's artistic production and half due to the lack of a true and typical model, resulting in something highly exaggerated and artificial.</p>
<p>Vorovsky observed this same point. Immediately after the above quotation, he said:</p>
<p>"Turgenev wrote the portrait of a figure that amazed him with as much objectivity as possible. Bazarov attracted his interest, prompting him to pick up his pen, but did not evoke a close, sympathetic response. 'Here lies the unmistakable prototype of a new era,' Turgenev said. Artsybashev's attitude towards Sanine, however, is not like this. His sympathy for the protagonist of the novel is an undeniable fact; he idealized the protagonist. He did not just depict a real type, he also wanted to imbue that type with qualities that he—the author—favored. 'The new era must be like this,' he seemed to be saying. With this in mind, Sanine, unlike Bazarov, who was sketched from life, is something that was 'made.' Sanine was able to complete his task so easily because of the benevolent results of the author's worrying about more favorable conditions for the protagonist (the protagonist's physical strength, the dullness and servility of the opposing figures); conversely, Bazarov acts freely, obeying his own internal theories. Sanine is an unreasonable existence in society, related to the type of useless superfluous things; but Bazarov is necessary, understood in the economic laws of social development."</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Bazarov is truly a type of an era, as this critic claims, or just the "unmistakable prototype of a new era," as for now, we need not discuss it. But in any case, it is an undeniable fact that Sanine is not a type of an era, not even a prototype. Sanine and Bazarov are both called representatives of nihilism, yet there is a great difference between them. In Bazarov's nihilism, there is the embryo of a new force, so this nihilism itself becomes a transition in a changing era, holding the hope of new creation. Conversely, Sanine's nihilism is entirely an expression of the spiritual paralysis of a desperate intellectual class. We can confirm this from the two characteristics that the author uses to depict Sanine. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Women (13)</h3>
<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>The man picked up a pebble again and threw it into the sea with all his might. It was as if he threw anything that aroused delusions into the sea at the same time. He said, "I have to throw it as far, far away as possible. I can do it!" But there are so many pebbles, can he throw them all?</p>
<p>The woman took off her short jacket, stood up, and stretched her limbs. She also picked up a pebble and threw it into the sea, but the result did not seem very</p>
<p>good. The woman then said in a self-deprecating way:</p>
<p>"I'm not good at this kind of thing; this is something children do!"</p>
<p>The two thought of the small boat stranded on the shallow beach, and they ran down together to look at the boat, pulling it out of the water onto the sand, and sat by the boat playing. Just as they were having fun, the man suddenly ran towards the small mound where they had been standing. After a while, he was seen running back. It turned out that he had gone to get the woman's short jacket! When he brought the short jacket, he put it by the boat. Only then did the two seem to notice that the clothes the man was wearing were not clothes for going into the water. When the boy rowed the boat around the fort from the bathing beach, he did not intend to go into the water, so he was wearing a white collared shirt and yellow shorts. At that time, because he was in a hurry to rescue the woman, he jumped directly into the sea from the cliff. Even though they were out of danger and the woman had woken up, he only cared about talking to her and forgot about himself. For some time, the wet clothes were still on his body. Only then did the woman say:</p>
<p>"Your clothes are all wet; it must be uncomfortable."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter."</p>
<p>"Why don't you take off your clothes and wring them out?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter; they'll dry in the sun."</p>
<p>The man drew in the sand with a wooden stick while talking to the woman. He told her about his past and future, or perhaps he said too much, even things he didn't need to say. So later, the woman asked him if he wanted to go swimming in the sea for a while. He said he could take her back to Huiquan Bathing Beach in the small boat, but she told him it wasn't necessary to go to so much trouble, because her boat was from the</p>
<p>hotel. She could tell the police in front, and they wouldn't need to take care of it anymore. She herself wanted to take a car back.</p>
<p>In fact, she just couldn't clearly see this man because she was too close to him. She wanted to let him leave and then savor this accidental encounter in detail.</p>
<p>She climbed onto the small mound. When she saw the boy get into the boat and row it away from the shore, she waved her hand on this side, and he waved his hand on the other side. After the boat turned past the cliff and disappeared, she lay down again and slept sweetly for a while.</p>
<p>They met again in the bathing beach the next day.</p>
<p>On the third day, they rowed the boat along the sea again, parked it in a small bay next to a long stretch of sand where there were few bathers, and played in the original forest for half a day. When they parted, the girl thought to herself: "This is really good; he doesn't seem to know who he loves yet, but everywhere it's clear that he loves me!" She used a happy and playful mood to guide the boy's feelings to a most trustworthy position. She forgot the danger of this matter, and, as usual, she was playing with fire simply because of the beauty of the fire, forgetting all the opportunities to get burned.</p>

<h3>Spiritual Food</h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>A gift for young people I imagine the readers often walked down the Fourth Road, that bustling and lively street? The hot and fragrant smells emanating from the many taverns on Fourth Road are so enticing! The fat and tender chickens and beautiful and plump ducks hanging in the bright glass windows... are so tempting! Even if you don't consider yourself a glutton, can you deny that you wouldn't swallow your saliva when you see these when your stomach is empty? Indeed, the ancients have already said for us: "Eating and drinking, men and women, are the greatest desires of mankind," and "Food (sex) is human nature."</p>
<p>If we continue east along the Fourth Road, the air of fat ducks and oily chickens becomes thinner, and all we see are rows of bookstores. Various books are displayed horizontally and vertically in the bookstore windows, some with deckle edges, some with pink bindings, some scientific, some fantastical, and some "fragrant and sensual." There, we can also see many people "stopping to watch," all looking like they can't wait to swallow those books. Their "intellectual desires" are strongly stirring.</p>
<p>Therefore, these two sections of Fourth Road are closely related to people, especially young people. Because these are no different from their food storehouses: the former is a material food storehouse, and the latter is a spiritual food storehouse. Material food is certainly necessary for humans every day, but spiritual food is as indispensable to the youth of the twentieth century as ordinary food.</p>
<p>If young people only live on ordinary food, if they only eat rice and meat every day and don't seek intellectual or ideological advancement, even if their health improves day by day and the diameter of their stomachs expands day by day, they are just contemptible walking corpses. Walking corpses are not what our era needs! To cultivate noble character, establish solid strength, and forge correct thinking, in short, to create the youth of an era, it is essential to rely on abundant spiritual food for cultivation. Therefore, spiritual food is so important and closely related to young people! (The so-called spiritual food is naturally not limited to books, but books are undoubtedly the most important raw material, so I am only talking about books here). Precisely because it is important and closely related, we should pay special attention when we take spiritual nourishment.</p>
<p>Recently, I have felt that young people, especially clerks in banks and money houses, and students in companies and foreign firms, do read quite a few books in their spare time. But if you check the books they read, they are either "XXX Ugly History," "Flower Field XXX Record," "Burning XXX Temple"... or "History of Sexuality," "Sexual XXX"... Who knows that they cannot obtain noble and correct knowledge here? These are just some feudal, corrupt, fantastical, and evil descriptions. Even if you can get temporary enjoyment here, your pure and upward ambition will be invisibly tormented, and your correct spiritual thinking will be permanently blinded. This is not empty talk, and it is not difficult to find real evidence in society; how many young people have committed suicide because of sexual problems, how many young people have suddenly had wild thoughts and learned to be swordsmen? This may have other backgrounds, but can you say that they are not influenced by these books? Young people who are tied to labor spend their rare free time reading a few books, and all they get are these bad influences. Isn't this a wrong thing! Therefore, young people, when we purchase a book, we should first choose carefully.</p>
<p>At the same time, after we have selected the books that are worth reading, we should cultivate a strong interest in them. In this way, the understanding of the content can be particularly easy and profound. The ancients drank with the Han Dynasty book, and the Song Dynasty female poet Li Yi'an and her husband gambled on fruits to remember the contents of the books. How strong was their interest in reading! They needed spiritual food as important as ordinary food! This demeanor is worth emulating by our young people. Samuel Smiles said it well: "Good books guide us to a most noble society and cultivate our greatest thoughts... It welcomes anyone with the same kindness. It teaches us when we are young; it comforts us when we are old."</p>
<h3>Lucky Wives</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>The wives in Shanghai are truly blessed. If their husbands are diligent and capable in military and political circles, no matter if they are on official trips abroad or attending the Lushan Conference, the wives can enjoy a leisurely life in villas in the concessions. The lives of the rich are better than heaven, especially the wives of important people. Eating fancy dishes, watching movies, riding in cars, and going to dance halls are no longer of interest to them. They have their own ways of playing. Shanghai originally has the most tricks. As long as the wives are willing, they can spend thousands of dollars to dig up a car permit, and so on. After occasionally burning incense at Putuo to pray for blessings? Tired? Chen Chuan dropped</p>
<p>Returning, they will start construction and wood, building a temple-like Buddhist building, and after the completion, the wife has long forgotten it, and does not care!</p>
<p>Listening to a modern wife on the radio, she can probably be classified into the comprador class. High-rise buildings, servants like clouds. The red sun is setting, and she is just yawning lazily and turning over from the soft copper bed. In addition to small leaks and large releases, in addition to Rong's wife's jade hands, she can open her mouth for food and need not work like a proxy. When Mei Lanfang arrives in Shanghai, he gathers a group of little sisters, and skilled people have booked the boxes in advance. Every night, they wear red and green, shining brightly, green and greasy. Their necks and fingers are heavily loaded with expensive diamonds, showing the Mei fans who have spent a few cents on the third floor without eating. When the roulette wheel closes, they play Jai Alai. Winning or losing is their husbands' business. After playing a few rounds of golf, they shout that their feet are sore and their backs hurt, take a car back, and call for their blessed cream. The weather, the sunrise, and the climate do not seem important to them. They eat and sleep, sleep and eat, blessed in life and blessed in death.</p>
<p>Her husband came to Shanghai barefoot from Ningbo, relying on his wife's luck. He sailed smoothly, opened a piece shop with his own funds. Our Ningbo wife is the old empress. Crawling out of the loft, she occupied a three-story building as a landlord, living in a Tongxiang room herself, and renting out the rest. She turned on the lights late and turned off the fire early, hiding the silver dollars and refusing to deposit them in the bank. Even if the house is empty for three months, the long-legged husband will support it. The wife still has a cup of shochu and four pieces of soy pork for every meal. After the meal, Aunt Zhang, Sister Li, sixteen circles of mahjong, hihihaha, heart wide and body fat, wearing a set of Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants, walking like a beetle climbing a wall, but this is exactly the wife's happiness. (The author speaks roughly, the wives above the clear should not think that they are talking about themselves. Although complimenting happiness is not a crime, but requesting corrections and other cumbersome procedures will affect our wives.)</p>
<p>The wife married our poor old man who sells words, and there is no happiness to speak of. Forcing him to receive royalties and watch a movie for two cents at a time is already worth tying a big knot on his belt. But finding a kickback on royalties, for fear of losing the stamp, a contract must be signed. If there are many manuscripts this month, she has already counted how many kickbacks there will be. If our articles are often corrected and offend the editor, and thrown into the wastepaper basket, wouldn't it affect even the small happiness of our wife?</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, goodbye, I will no longer apologize here丨</p>

<h3>Washing Hair</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>Receiving a basket of vegetables from my mother, who had returned from the small vegetable market, I discovered a bundle of chaste tree with lush green leaves, and a package of fried Qiao Guo. In my vague mind, I remembered that today is the annual meeting of the heavenly lovers 丨丨 Qixi.</p>
<p>Indeed, having long been accustomed to the Gregorian calendar, I have somewhat forgotten the old calendar. If it weren't for my vegetarian grandmother reminding me on the first and fifteenth of each month 丨丨 According to vegetarians, the first and fifteenth of each month are called Yuan Cai, which must be eaten, there is a saying that "if you don't eat vegetables on the first and fifteenth of each month (eating vegetables is eating vegetarian), you will be reincarnated in a fishing boat". Generally, they are afraid of not being able to reincarnate well in the next life, even those who are not full without meat every meal also reluctantly endure for a day.</p>
<p>With short hair now, washing hair is commonplace and not surprising, but in the past when hair was long and trailing, washing hair was a grand event, not allowed until the seventh day of the seventh month, the so-called Qixi Festival.</p>
<p>Sure enough, hair that is long and plentiful is extremely difficult to dry after it gets wet. Letting it hang loose? Too unseemly. When my scalp itches, those who love cleanliness desperately comb and comb their scalp, and unfortunately, the head 丨丨 scalp 丨丨 breaks and bleeds; mothers will scratch for a while with their fingers. Chinese women who do not like to trim their nails, Magu's claws, become a place to collect dirt. Moreover, the coagulation of fragrant oil and dust, and the crystallization of sweat and hairspray, form a kind of non-fragrant, non-smelly, both fragrant and smelly, inexplicable breath. While combing hair under the crystal curtain, it can definitely make the connoisseurs who watch the combing cover their noses and glance away.</p>
<p>Only the seventh day of the seventh month is the time for a major cleaning of hair; removing accumulated dirt and grime with one sweep, eliminating residual fragrance and odor. Draping wet, dripping long hair, scattering it behind, and enjoying the gentle cool breeze on the hair, gently waving a thin fan, slowly chewing Qiao Guo, talking about the Qixi Festival, the joy is harmonious. After being blown by the cool breeze once, the heavy, dripping hair gradually dried and relaxed. Then, loosely comb a braid and drag it behind, swinging left and right as the body turns.</p>
<p>Picking off petals of the chaste tree leaves, pounding them in a small stone mortar for a while, a green, oily, slippery liquid will be squeezed out. Put it in a basin, add a spoonful of water, filter it, and it will become a very good hair washing liquid. Immerse the hair in the green liquid for ten minutes, and with a little rubbing, the hair will be exceptionally clean, which is much more economical and practical than imported "XX Hair Washing Liquid". But how many people in Shanghai, which is particularly prone to foreign worship, pay attention to this?</p>
<p>"Chaste tree hairpin and cloth skirt" was the thrifty virtue of the past, and it is no longer applicable to the present. Originally, these backward (?) thoughts, how can they corrode (?) the minds of young people? Now, all that is needed is beauty, fashion, and making a splash! What does it matter whether it's Eastern or Western goods? Chaste tree leaf liquid for washing hair is troublesome and has no fragrance, how can it compare to the fragrance and convenience of hair washing liquid! As long as the thing is good, what does it matter whether it is Chinese or foreign goods? Isn't it the same to spend money?</p>
<p>A numb crowd without national thought, only knowing beauty and not knowing patriotism, their borderless cosmopolitanism (?) generosity is worthy of admiration? But, after the economic collapse, the Chinese market is declining, the countryside is bankrupt, the industry is underdeveloped, and the Chinese do not know how to love rotten domestic goods. Some?

<p>Clerk Correspondence</p>
<h3>Hard to be a Person</h3>
<p>Editor Sir, I am a newly apprenticed shop assistant at a cigarette paper store. Before completing my apprenticeship, I was often scolded by the young owner of the shop. Because of my apprenticeship, I had to submit to his authority, adopting a policy of non-resistance, enduring everything with gritted teeth, secretly shedding tears. Moreover, my hometown is far away in Ningbo, and I have no relatives to rely on in Shanghai. If I don't complete my apprenticeship and return home, how can I face my parents? If my neighbors see me, they would secretly call me a useless person who might as well have stayed at home, wouldn't I be bringing shame upon myself? So, I can only endure; all the unjust grievances, I can only entrust to the phrase "Heaven knows." Yesterday, over a very small matter, I was again scolded by that violent young owner. I tried to defend myself slightly, and he became enraged, slapping me several times. Because I have no power, I can only accept my bad luck. In less than five minutes, he sternly said, "Get out tomorrow, you… pig…" Hearing the words "get out," I felt a pang in my heart, and tears flowed down. I thought to myself, if I had money, why would I suffer so much? If I really leave, I won't be able to find a suitable job for a while. If I don't leave, I can't bear this living hell. If he really tells me to get out, after I leave, can I immediately avenge myself? Alas! I am now in a dilemma, begging the kind sir who relieves suffering and rescues from distress to give me a good solution. I hope you can answer me in your esteemed publication soon. I will be twelve thousand times grateful. My mind is uneasy; I have written this and my hand is sore, so I will stop here. If there are any incoherent parts, please make corrections. Respectfully wishing you well, Lu Xingfa.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Lu has not provided details about what caused the conflict between him and the young owner. Therefore, we dare not speculate on who is right and who is wrong. We hope Mr. Lu will calmly reflect on himself once more. If the fault lies with you, you should bravely admit your mistake and request to continue working. If the fault lies with the other party, then there is naturally no reason to admit your mistake, but you may ask someone to intercede in the hope of continuing your position. Enduring some losses is not very important: you must know that it is not yet the time to resist capitalists. Before the oppressed are organized, individual resistance is merely sacrificing oneself.</p>

<h3>War and Peace 17 (Four-Act Play)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Act Two / The Fleeing Crowd</p>
<p>Young Master: Nanfa, get me that telescope.</p>
<p>(The orderly enters the workshop on the right, looking for the telescope.) Aunt, let us take a look at the strange appearance of those refugees. Concubine: I don't want to watch, I want to go in and rest for a while. (She comes in and meets Defa, secretly pinching him.) Defa, take it quickly. Madam: (Waking up.) Oh! Zhou Ma, where have we arrived?</p>
<p>Maidservant: Madam, the car hasn't started yet. Madam: It hasn't started yet? What's wrong? Maidservant: There are still a few young ladies who haven't arrived, and we are still waiting.</p>
<p>Madam: Oh! What time is it now? Maidservant: (Taking out a watch from her bosom) It's ten past eleven.</p>
<p>Young Master: There's nothing to see, they are all scary-looking freaks. … Damn it, that child wants milk, but the mother refuses, and is hitting him. … Oh, a man is walking over, probably the husband, scolding her. … Now she takes out her breast to show the man, ah, it's dry, no milk, no wonder the child is crying. … Humph, this man has picked up the child. … Haha, this is quite interesting. … Oh dear, that old woman has fallen. Oh dear, blood is coming out too. … What? A child is being beaten by an adult and is crying.</p>
<p>Concubine: May I ask, Madam, are you also planning to go to Beijing to hide this time?</p>
<p>Madam: Yes, but I am going to Tianjin. The news is getting tighter every day, so it's better to avoid it.</p>
<p>Voice: Selling Tanggu prawns, selling roast chicken and salted duck eggs. Concubine: So Madam hasn't fled before?</p>
<p>Madam: I had originally planned to go to Tianjin a long time ago. But their master (referring to the maidservant, meaning her husband) is busy all day long and cannot easily take leave. Because he is not in good health, he often has minor ailments and must have a trusted person to serve him. So, I sent my family to the French Concession in Tianjin first. I myself took an old nanny and an old servant, who followed him and would not leave. As old as I am, what am I afraid of? But the news is getting tighter, saying that they will attack Beijing within a few days. The people at home were extremely anxious and insisted that I flee, so as not to worry him. He said that he would also go to Tianjin within a day or two.</p>
<p>Young Master: So that's the whole story. That old woman is selling steamed buns, and that country child snatched a bun from her. The old woman went after him and fell on the ground and got hurt.</p>
<p>Orderly: Hey, Yangcun rice cake.</p>
<p>Young Master: Huh? How strange. Defa, come and take a look. (The orderly takes a piece of rice cake from the window, eats it, and takes the telescope from the young master's hand.) Look at what they are doing in that field over there?</p>
<p>Orderly: The ones with three people in front and one behind? That's plowing.</p>
<p>Young Master: Plowing? Why are there horses? Voice: Sir, give me the money.</p>
<p>Orderly: Wait a minute, what's the rush? …Aren't those three people in front pulling the plow?</p>
<p>Young Master: Why aren't they using oxen or horses? Orderly: Who knows. Voice: Sir, hurry up!</p>
<p>Orderly: What's your rush? I'm not buying it anymore, give it back to me and see who you can get money from. (He throws the eaten rice cake back to him.)</p>
<p>Voice: Sir! Have pity on me, a few copper coins mean nothing to you!</p>
<p>Young Master: Give it to him, a few copper coins and you have to argue with others. Hey, (to the cake seller) I ask you, why do people in the countryside plow by hand?</p>
