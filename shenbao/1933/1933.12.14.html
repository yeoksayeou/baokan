<h3>時評　中央代表赴粤之展望元</h3>
<p>此次中央四代表張繼等赴粤。與陳胡等會晤。關係確甚重要。蓋此次會晤而能商得圓滿之結果。則非特中央與西南從前之嫌怨。可以消釋。即閩省事件。亦可減少若干嚴重性。若其結果不幸而不良。意見竟不能拉近。則其將來糾紛所起。演變所經。任何人不能料其究極。故此次四代表之赴粤。不僅中央希望能達到精神團結之目的。即我一般但求安居樂業之人民。亦不勝馨香祝禱其成功也。</p>
<p>至如何而能獲得精神團結之功效。則中央代表抵港時。在輪上已有誠懇之表示。其言曰。（譜領袖同志。均曾追隨總理有年。患難憂讒。一切久共。此時惟有忍痛思維。同爲國宋民族求一出路。當忍一切不能忍之艱難。受一切必須受之責備。所謂多難興邦。未必不在此際。）吾人讀此。固深感其言之痛切。而又追維往事。悵觸萬端。蓋國事所不敗壞至此。中央諸領袖所以乖離至此。皆由於不能忍此不能忍之艱難。不能受此必須受之責備。今日在任何方面之領袖。試問自思。能否認赴粤諸代表之言否。國難嚴重至此。當局所負之責任。當然十分艱難。惟此艱難。須負責者皆能摒除私見。和衷共濟。方能希冀其勉强渡過。然而諸領袖於艱難之際。恐未必盡能認清所負責任之重要。不顧毁譽。不計個人利害。而毅然以一肩擔當。且應付此艱難之政局。主張當然不能盡同。已之主張未必是。而每不肯犧牲。人之主張未必非。而每不屑接受。有此推諉與自信之兩念。勢必互相捍格。積之旣久。乃生乖離之現象。此即所謂應忍一切不能忍之艱難是也。</p>
<p>自來當大任者。必不能免人之責備。即古之聖賢或大有功於國家之人。尚不能免天下後世之非議。則世界安有一無可議之人。且非議與責難。正足以資儆惕而糾正個人之過失。故愈光明坦白之人。愈不避人之非議與責難。或且進而歡迎人之非議與責難。倘若因人之非議與責難。而必斷斷然極力聲辨其非是。或防遏之而使不得盡其所言。則此隔閡常藴積於中。而無從宣洩雙方之意見。更將無由諒解。爲政之這。貴疏通而不貴窒塞。故我人希望雙方以互相疏通爲主。人苟不諒而偶加責備。日後亦必能以事實證明。而渙然氷釋。此即所謂應受一切必須受之責備是也。</p>
<p>是故今日而欲希望西南調解之成功。必須諸領袖澈底覺悟。眞心實行此中央和平使者之兩語。蓋必先能開誠相見。以國家民族爲前提。無不可犧牲之利。無不可公開之言。無不可消釋之嫌隙。而後始能言團結。苟能如是。則意見雖無論若何背馳。條件雖無論若何衝突。寗有不可商量者哉。又豈僅西南問題無不可商量者哉。吾人翹首企踵以祝望其成功。</p>

<p>（二）報載本人談話中、有接收長城各口、因奉中央命令、故現停止談判、將來如何進行、當以中央命令是從云云、完全與事實相反、華北當局、正在積極進行接收、根本亦未奉到中央接收命令、報載係記者誤聽所致、</p>
<h3>談判原則呈部參考</h3>
<p>殷氏旋又詳述通車談判及奉令停止之經過、謂通車談判、係根據接收北寗路而來、當時日方歸還北寗路後、即以全線通車爲條件、並約定十月間開始談判、本人職司北寗路局長、故在事先特約集局内外路政專家、詳密研究、在有形無形不承認僞國·及不喪權辱國之條件下、覓一妥善通車方案、最後擬定二項談判原則、呈由鐵道部鑒核、作爲參考、蓋本人之職責、亦至如此而止、其後經數度談判、卒因種種困難、完全停頭、以迄於今云云、殷氏最后談稱、今日（即昨日）已謁晤顧部長、明晚）即今晚）滬京、在京勾留數日、然後北返、</p>

<h3>赴贛謁蔣使命二</h3>
<p>據邵氏談、本人此次赴贛、晋謁蔣委員長、一係代表楊虎城氏報告軍務、一係會商開發西北問題、當本人離浙赴贛之前、浙省頗爲安謐、外傳閩浙邊境發生衝突之説、未有所聞、本人刻正在滬醫治牙疾、定於三數日内晋京、列席四中全會、藉與諸故舊晤談、然後再行乘車返陜、</p>
<h3>連日晤宋結果圓滿</h3>
<p>開發西北、首重交通與水利、西北目前困窮達於極點、實無餘裕致力於此、是故本人此次南下、迭向中央及全國經濟委員會、請求恊助辦理、全國經濟委員會、現已允負此項重任、本人連日往訪宋常委子文、夜換意見、結果、頗爲圓滿、一俟提出經委會常會通過後、即可着手辦理、惟目前所預定實行者、僅係最低限度之一年計劃、如建築西安至肅州之公路等等、俾中央對於財力方面、不致感覺困難、其次爲辦理獸醫、蓋西北爲畜牧之區、預防獸瘟、實爲必要之圖也、至於改良棉種等各項事業、在省府能力所及之下、均已次第實行矣、</p>
<h3>滬上銀界投資西北</h3>
<p>本人此次來滬、曾以私人之交誼、往訪銀行界領袖、告以西北現狀、並促投資開發西北、張公權氏前赴西北視察、所得印象甚佳、頗覺滿意、上海銀行早已實行投資西北、辦理棉業合作事業、將來接踵而赴西北投資者、想必大有人也、</p>

<h3>浦東榮麟碼頭　工人爭卸風潮　春和輪來貨被阻　社會局進行調解</h3>
<p>今日可和平解决浦東榮麟碼頭、向由裕昌煤號租用、所用工人等、由裕昌雇用工頭李鴻記包工辦理、本年該公司、將該碼頭向裕昌煤號收回自辦、委托廣東路十號華倫洋行經理、所有碼頭工人、實行取消包工制、改爲投標雇用、李鴻記即表示反對、必欲仍由彼續任工頭、華倫告以欲做、亦可照定章投標、李不投、開標結果、爲陳廷章所得、詎意陳到該碼頭接辦工人裝卸事務之際、李鴻記不允退讓、釀成種種糾紛、陳恐引起無謂爭執、遂向華倫洋行、聲明退標、不願辦理棘手事務、</p>
<h3>二次爭持</h3>
<p>華倫於陳退標後、復從投標中選取第二人邵友溪得標、李鴻記仍表示反對、中經各方調解、而邵友溪又自動放棄、致陷該碼頭於無法營業、據榮麟公司與華倫洋行負責人語記者、李鴻記工頭阻止他人接辦、使碼頭不能開工、而已經約定卸儎商輪、臨時遇去者、先後已達六船、損失二萬餘元、</p>
<h3>工人訂約</h3>
<p>小工四百人、因此糾紛、歷兩月餘、無工可作、工人生計斷絶、無法支持、遂於全體小工中、公推仇安泰等五人、於本月三日、到榮麟公司請願、要求迅速開工、碼頭當局卽與全體工人用代表名義、訂立裝卸之約、廢除包工制、該約簽立時、並分呈社會局公安局及黨政各機關、定本月十二日正式開工、第一船係起卸和豐公司春和輪煤斤、詎料風潮又起、</p>
<h3>雙方爭奪</h3>
<p>春和輸於十二日進口、下午四時、船到榮麟碼頭、輪内所裝均係煤斤、原擬當日做夜工開艙起卸、碼頭工人已全體齊集、準備工作、詎料李鴻記亦率領小工一百數十名、到碼頭欲奪卸此貨、雙方形勢險惡、當由碼頭職員報告公安局及保安隊、各派大隊兵警至碼頭、深慮發生衝突、卽由公安局警官禁止兩方工人、不准開艙起卸、以免發生流血慘劇、因此春和輪被阻在碼頭、無法卸貨、</p>
<h3>進行調解</h3>
<p>昨日上午、由社會局召集勞資兩方代表到局調解、擬以和平方法消弭爭潮、榮麟派林君前往、進行談判、一面由三區公安局警察保安隊等駐守碼頭、禁止兩方爭卸衝突、上午談判未有結果、至下午、社會局派出代表、又到榮麟樓、邀集李鴻記·仇安泰·及資方代表等、再行和解、下午六時、猶在會商、據資方負責人言、大致今日可望解决云、</p>

<h3>生絲對美推銷不易　品質成本數量應注意</h3>
<p>同業意見亦未能一致江浙絲廠業、近因國外絲銷鋭減、國内成本過鉅、以致日呈衰落之象、江浙各地絲廠同業公會、迭次推派代表、在上海舉行會議、决議、除請經濟委員會速組統制度員會外、復議决組織生絲對美推銷恊會、關於此事、外間頗有種種傳聞、實業社記者昨特往訪繆鍾秀君於商檢局、據談各情、茲誌於下、</p>
<h3>擱置原因</h3>
<p>據云對外推銷生絲事、原則上人人贊同、惟如何辦法、方能奏效、頗費研究、本人初自美國歸來時、曾主張設立大規模推銷機關、扶植生絲出口事業、繼鑒於國内政局不定、絲業本身、又無餘力可辦、此事遂亦擱置不談、近日報載本人已與各方接洽就緒、完全不確、個人以爲美國存絲、多至九萬餘包、而每月銷用量、僅三萬餘包、推銷一層、亦非易事、且國絲成本過高、非有特殊力量、以爲之助、實無法可使華絲運銷國外、又如品質不良、缺少現貨等、亦爲華絲滯銷原因、故推銷一層、固屬重要、而品質成本數量三項、亦應加以注意、同時輔以推銷上之種種便利、庶能收效、</p>
<h3>困難事實</h3>
<p>又據記者探悉、組織生絲推銷會之所以難於成爲事實、原因尚在絲廠業之不能團結、蓋江浙兩省絲廠、共約二百家、而各廠實力厚薄不一、所出品質、亦高下不齊、雖在此絲業極度衰落之下、所受影響略同、但資雄力厚之大廠、對於出口方面、早籌有辦法、所困難者、惟一般中小廠商、在推銷上尚不得不仰人鼻息耳、各廠之環境不同、對於此事意見、遂亦未能一致、然此中大廠究屬少數、故江浙各地絲廠同業公會、爲維護多數利益計、現仍在積極進行中、至所謂不久可望組織成立、則尚有待云、</p>
<h3>土地局　通告催領土地執業證</h3>
<p>土地局自將滬南漕涇區土地執業證開發完竣、洋涇法華閘北區開始調換以來、已經繪製之土地執業證人民、未經到局領取者甚多、事關人民産權、皆由該局代爲愼重保管、聞該局設近鑒於製就之土地執業證日多、殊不便永久代爲保營、業定於卽日起、逐日將未經領證業主户名、登載各報、望各業主翻閲該項廣告後、限三個月内、携同當時調換土地執業證、由該局製給之收回舊單收據、至該局領取、如過期不領、卽將訂定酌收保管費云</p>

<p>新聲社記者、昨日下午、走訪市公用局局長徐佩璜氏、與談各項問題如下、</p>
<p>收回給水權據徐氏云、徐家滙及南市船舶給水、向由法商辦理、國人素未注意、致喪權利、不可數計、市公用局當以主權攸關、迭經與對方交涉、現已完全由市公用局收回自辦、水電供給、改由閘北水電公司供給、局内另設一給水辦事處、以專司其事、</p>
<p>浦東自來水又謂浦東電燈、自經局中將線接通後、浦東方面、已極感便利、惟浦東自來水問題、亦亟須設立、本局現亦擬有計劃、凡建築水塔以及機件水管等、經費定三十萬元、地點决定在瀾泥渡、先就人烟稠密之處舉辦、以便利浦東居民、惟因市庫自一二八以後、財政較爲困難、致迄今猶未能實現、現本市擬另闢途徑、先與浦東地方熱心人士磋商、或由官商合作、俾得早日實現、完成以後、統由給水處管理、</p>
<p>浦東之交通至於浦東交通、自市府辦理市輪渡後、往來已較前便利穏妥、但市府爲繁榮浦東市面起見、除尚擬舉辦董家渡對渡外、浦東大道、亦已由工務局積極建築、短期間内、卽可全部完成、故市公用局已準備在浦東大道、開關公共汽車、俾使浦東交通、得益臻完備、</p>

<h3>今日開幕之女青年會國貨展覽</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>提倡國貨、在婦女界應負的責任，本是比男子爲多。所以提倡國貨，希望收到效果，非由女子出來實力的鼓動一番不可。　　今年的國貨年，轉瞬要告别了。平心而論，雖没有多大成效，可是國貨公司增多了；仿造舶來品的國貨，居然應有盡有了；各地方的國貨展覽，和注意國貨的工作，總算不遺餘力了。可是國貨的推銷，總不能暢行無阻，工廠的出路，總是感受困難，國貨的流行，總不敵洋貨日貨的傾銷。單是上海一個地方，十個月中，外國化妝品的消耗，已達一百三十九萬八千八百六十四元，大家打打算盤，眞要汗流浹背。可見上海一地方，眞是銷行洋貨的大市塲，而報效這筆巨欵的，都是一般太太奶奶和小姐們。爲了要漂亮，而利權外溢不顧了，爲了要摩登，而暢銷外貨不顧了，爲了要好看，而鄙棄國貨不顧了。説者謂最墮落最無志氣的，是上海社會；可憐墮落這上海社會的，固然不乏趨奉夫人諂媚太太拜倒石榴裙下的一般洋化先生，可是一大半的罪魁，老實不客氣，一般太太奶奶小姐們，是不得諉卸了。故在今日時代，與其勸男子們提倡國貨，不如請女子們樂用國貨；與其由男子出來空喊空閙，不如請太太奶奶小姐來實心實力的鼓動一番，大家來下個决心，把從頭到脚，從自身到家人，凡喫的用的着的住的，一槪都用國貨。如果没有國貨的話，最好是不用，萬一不能不用，那麽千萬要節省，要想法替代的物品。今後我國貨的生命線，都在太太奶奶小姐們手裏，都仗她們來做護法天尊，都仗她們來主持發動。　　上海女青年會主辦的國貨展覽會，仗着余英傑夫人宋杏村夫人等熱心奔走，慘淡經營，居然於今天在圓明園路八號開幕。陳列的方法，打破從前平面的呆板的，死的，採取立體的，流動的，活的方式。如模範家庭，兒童服裝，婦女服裝，以及一切家庭中必需的用品，自臥室，書房，客廳，以迄厠所，廚房等等，俱有極經濟極美觀極合科學方法的布置。確開國貨展覽之新紀元。在國貨年的年底，有這齣壓臺戲，倒值得大家注意如欣幸的。</p>
<p>國貨論壇</p>
<h3>婦女與冬令用品</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>西北風呼呼的吹個不停，各種商店生意興旺了，女太太們更是大忙而特忙。忙的什麽？忙的採辦。採辦什麽？不外冬貨。——冬令用品——所以婦女和冬令用品，是有密切關係的。吾前天到親戚家裏去，遇到胡太太剛從採辦貨物回來，她説國貨年眞有道理。從前我認爲好的用品，只有外國人能造，可是現在到了國貨公司，樣樣都有，式式完全，中國貨何嘗不如外國呢？我看她買了一大批貨品，我替她檢點檢點，居然一些不錯。後來到馮太太那邊，這位馮太太正在查問她的小姐，説她千不該，萬不該，不該去買外國貨，可是她的小姐説，這樣東西，實在没有國貨，所以去買外國貨的。我和她研究之下，這種用品，已有替代的國貨了，可是大家還没有知道，因爲小姐的一時疏忽，便引動了馮太太一塲火氣，其實呢，買東西，實在是一件難事。尤其是難得出門的太太小姐。當然要上當，當然要迷惑。何况冬至節邊，年頭年尾，送禮忙，過節忙，應酬忙，處理家務忙，忙中採辦用品，更覺容易疏忽，容易受欺，所以我替女太太們着想，倒有三個辦法：</p>
<p>（第一）抱定冬令用品，非國貨不買，如果找不到國貨，可省便省。千萬不可馬虎。</p>
<p>（第二）抱定國貨非向有信用之國貨公司採辦不可，外間掛羊頭賣狗肉的冐牌國貨，不要再去上他們的當。</p>
<p>（第三）出門購買貨品以前，先要研究一下，什麽貨，到什麽地方去買，什麽貨，應用什麽牌子。都該先事凖備，才不致隨便購買或誤購外貨與日貨。</p>
<p>（第三）對於不忠實的廣告，或滑頭式的店員，以日貨充國貨來騙人的，千萬要謹愼防備。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>寫給都市小姐們</h3>
<p>— 許難公</p>
<p>寒暑表的水銀線，已經降到了四五十度，冬季大減價的市招，飛舞在馬路的二旁，無疑總這是冬之來臨。</p>
<p>枯萎了的樹葉被寒風吹脱了枝幹，人們也由夾衫而換上了棉衣，都市裏的小姐們，又得破費她們一點心思，整備着二二年式的冬裝。</p>
<p>無庸否認地，都市小姐們是全國婦女界的領導，她們底一舉一動，是會影響到内地各處的女婦們，剪髮，旗袍，不都是由於都市的熱烈，倡行而風染到了内地？所以她們是時代的女型。</p>
<p>今年是國貨年，都是小姐們對於國貨的提倡，有了怎樣底成績，這眞是使人痛心，她們非但没有盡力提倡，反而努力於洋貨的推銷，否則，洋貨化妝品的輸入不會有這驚人的數量。</p>
<p>在這裏我很希望着都市的小姐們，到女青年會國貨展覽會去看看，把你們醉心於洋貨的心理，轉變到提倡國貨的陣線，創造一個國貨化的冬裝，那麽，我想信在明年的冬季，也許在不久的將來，一定能普遍地風行於全國，而且不失爲領導者的地位，爲時代女性的典型努力吧！女士們，這正是你們爲國貨年放一異彩的偉大建樹的時期了。</p>
<h3>關於熱水袋與手爐</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>人生物質享用，當然要進步的路上走，但是生在落後的中國，却喜二十世紀式的消費，濫用，不斷的利權外溢，總有一天，相對唏嘘，作牢囚式的奴隸，要享用國貨，也來不及了！　　所以中國貨，無斌簡陋至如何程度，做了中國人，就應該用中國貨，這是天經地義的事！現在國人享用外貨的無謂消費，簡直是大家尋死路！到了冬令，尤其可慨！電氣爐，絲絨墊，熱水袋，没有一樣不是洋貨，輕而易舉的熱水袋，太太，奶奶，小姐，幾站人手一隻，雖然其中也有非國貨原料的國貨熱水袋，用的很少，現代姑娘，現代婦女，看到白銅手爐是呆笨，落伍！不屑手之撫之，而加以極度的鄙視了！我以爲玲瓏小巧的雲白銅手爐，苟其做了一個輕軟的絨布套，燃了好的炭團，熱的時間比較熱水袋悠久的多，并且可以省去換水等麻煩和保持利權，何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>怎樣購置冬令用品？</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>唉：時間過得眞快啊！一轉瞬間，冬天已經到來了！在冬天，我們日常的用品，自然要比較其他的時季，格外來得多些，格外來得複雜些，同時，經濟方面的支出，當然也隨之而增加了。所以我們在冬季裏頭，對於用品方面，却也有注意之必要，茲就管見所及，略述於下，高明之士，幸指教焉。</p>
<p>（一）要注意是否國貨－人家説：（今年是國貨年，大家都要用國貨），這句話誠然不錯，不過我進一步地説：（是中國人，應該用國貨，不論他是不是國貨年，只要我一天一天的活着，那麽，頭頂中國天，脚踏中國地，一切的一切，均非國貨不可，所以，在冬令裏，我們購置東西，第一須注意是否國貨，國貨則購之，非國貨則棄之，如此，才是一個頂天立地的愛國者。</p>
<p>（二）要注意是否堅固耐用－年來中國商人，大都目光如豆，製造粗糙貨物以騙人者，正復不少，這種商人，實爲國貨之敵，於國貨前途之發展，實有莫大之妨碍，故我們購買冬令物品，須就其堅固耐用之國貨購之，至於式樣之美觀與否，當在其次，如此，應改革一般商人粗造國貨之心理，而國貨出品，自可逐漸精良，而外國貨之打倒，不久，亦當在意中事也。</p>
<p>以上二項，爲余個人感想所及，其他如價格等方面之注意點尚多，爲本刊寳貴之篇福計，就此擱筆。</p>
<h3>國貨的商標</h3>
<p>— 華華</p>
<p>第一種出品必須要有商標或説明，那是一定的；所以没有商標的貨物使我們無從辨别他是否國貨，我們當然以不買爲是。而另名還有一種情形，就是有的國貨的商標和説明却完全用了外國字，這是不是應該的？</p>
<p>一國有一國的文字，和語言一樣，可以説就是國家和民族的靈魂，那麽，本國的貨物當然應該用自己的文字作商標和説明的；尤其往在目前，我們中國的出品差不多大半只是行銷國内的。　　其次，同胞們都能夠認識外國字嗎？全用外國字的結果，恐怕不但毫無利益，在行銷上却反會受到阻碍，因爲一般人將認他爲外國貨而不屑去購買了。商家也許原來想冒充洋貨的（多麽可嘆的心理啊！），可是我們的同胞不比從前，現在是都知道愛用國貨的了！</p>
<p>所以我希望以後的國貨商廠，在他們的出品上不論商標説明，完全都用我們自己的文字，而且寫得愈詳細愈好，使我們同胞們一望了然他是國貨而樂於購買，這一件對於廠家没有什麽麻煩，國貨本身没有什麽損失，而對於國譽和銷路方面却大有利益的事情，我想總没有人説不願意的罷！</p>

<p>現在的青年男女，大約没有一個不被摩登二字所風靡了的。你也摩登，我也摩登。於是乎大家競尚奢華，大家購買外貨。你穿嗶嘰四裝：我穿法蘭絨袍子。國貨香粉，是很少被摩登女郎應用的；於是各國來路貨的化裝品，如四七一一之類，就銷路大暢了。結果，國貨的消耗，日形衰落，豈不糟糕？</p>
<p>我以爲現在的青年男女，不妨大家摩登。但不必大大的推銷洋貨。因爲，摩登者西文之譯音，我代之謂也。推廣其意義，或可譯作時髦，但時髦儘管時髦，不必一定要用洋貨的。國貨又何嘗不可用呢？因爲時髦者，式樣美觀而已。國貨何嘗是必不式樣美觀呢？</p>
<p>或曰，洋貨品質細膩，花式美麗，深合現代青年之意想，暢消無阻，固其宜也。余應之曰：君言諒亦不謬，但洋貨必較國貨價貴，且亦不必經久耐用。自經濟之觀點以言，究以服用國貨爲宜。而况人民服用國貨，國家又有裨益乎</p>
<p>所以我要向現在之摩登青年進一言曰：摩登者，現代之謂也。摩登不妨。大大的推銷洋貨則不必。而况服用國貨，對己可以省錢，對國尤有利益，而國貨亦未必都是不摩登的呢？</p>
<h3>女人和冬天的舶來品</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>一般的人，都説外國貨在中國，所以能夠暢銷，就因爲一般的女人愛用外國貨的關係，雖然我們不能單獨去責備女人，在這裏男人的西裝革履，愛用洋貨也未始没有，但比較的質和量方面；的確，女子所和的洋貨，較多於男子呢</p>
<p>尤其是在冬天吧？女人所用的外國貨，也更比别的季候爲多，我們約略的觀察一下，她們面上塗的白粉，紅的胭脂，是舶來品，身上穿的衣服，裏面不必説，外面的一襲大衣，便是外國呢所製的，還有女人們，這幾天做手工所用的絨線都是外國貨呀！　　所以在冬天，女人用的外國貨最多，而外國貨在中國也許銷路最是發達。以前，像呢，絨，絨線，的確那些東西中國人是不會做，但現在，國貨呢絨，國貨絨線，已先後發現於市塲之上了，而一般的中國女子，却十九不歡喜用那種呢絨，那種絨綫，專想買外國貨，那眞是太呆了吧？</p>

<h3>布蔬齋隨筆</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>我們是病夫，我們是弱小民族。你看外國人挺胸凸肚，何等神氣！回看我們自己，男的傴腰曲背，咳嗽連連；女的身肢瘦弱，望風欲倒。於是有心人嘆道：（男的盡是賈寳玉，女的盡是林黛玉，給我當作口頭肉，國家那得遭人當做魚肉！</p>
<p>（外國民族的强，强在講究衛生。我國民族的弱，弱在不知衛生）。這幾句話人人是承認對的。不過我有些異議，我國人並不是不知衛生，却是知之而不能行，於是積年累月，便變成一個病夫了。不信，我可引證一首詩來，便可知西洋現今的衛生學説，我國却發明了好幾千年。</p>
<p>（古有行道人，陌上見三叟，年各百餘歲，相與鋤禾莠。住車問三叟，何以得此壽？上叟前致辭：内中嫗貌醜。中叟前致辭：量腹節所受。下叟前致辭：夜臥不覆首。要哉！三叟言，所以能長久）。</p>
<p>這是三國時應璩所做的三叟詩，詩的要旨：是勸人寡慾清心。；勸人節止飲食；勸人呼吸清氣，那豈不是嶄新的學説嗎？想不到幾千年前已有人道及，我不禁翹起大拇指，稱贊一聲道：（應休璉先生——應璩字——却是古代衛生大家呀！）</p>
<p>食品雜談</p>
<h3>幾件大衆化的冬令食品</h3>
<p>— 山秀</p>
<p>膠滋藥，燕參銀耳，這許多布爾喬亞的食品，我是只聞其名，不要説没有吃過，就是看也没有看見過。所以我不敢貿貿然的評論牠的滋補的程度。不過，我却曾聽見老人家説過，這些東西，窮漢固不能吃，而有些人的體質也是不能吃的：由此，牠的滋補力再强些，也只好讓少數中的少數人去領味了。這裏，我將介紹幾件大衆化的食品。而且是切合現在的時令的。</p>
<p>荳腐漿不論城市鄉村，我們都可以看到鱗列的荳腐店，在每天的早上，費五六個銅子，可很便的得着一大杯熱騰騰的荳腐漿。這東西下肚，旣驅寒氣於盡凈；而且，誰都知道牠是富有蛋白質和維他命的，於身體之滋補，不言而喻。假使自做的話，也很便捷。</p>
<p>雞蛋農家的副業，最普遍的，要算養雞了。所以雞蛋的生産，確是農家一注可觀的收入。牠的功效，我敢説與蕪窩人參實不相仲伯。價錢亦極便宜，一塊錢可以買到五六十個。何以我説切合現在的時令呢？因爲冬令所生産的雞蛋最爲清潔的原故。</p>
<p>蘿蔔在氣候異常乾燥的現在，水果是屬於少數人的，大衆化的，就是蘿蔔了。説起蘿蔔，誰都知道牠不但能解渴，在醫藥上也很有價值；旣能退熱，又能預防白喉菌之侵入。而醫藥中之價廉者，亦推此爲獨步了！</p>
<p>冬，是相傳的吃補藥時期。然而，補藥不是我們一般平民階級所能享受的。我們祗好照着古話：（醫補不如食補。）吃些荳腐漿，雞蛋和蘿葡了。</p>
<h3>冬令的鄉村補品</h3>
<p>— 偉中</p>
<p>朔風緊緊地吹到冬天，一般人認爲服補劑的季節到了。在都市的人，通常服用着紅色補丸，維太露，散拿吐瑾，自來血以及解百勒魚肝油，奥斯麥牛肉汗等舶來的補品其實要講補的話，那又何必用這些舶來的補品呢？又何必把我們汗血的金錢，鉅萬鉅萬的輸送到外國去呢？</p>
<p>我們鄉下流行着一句話，呌做（藥補不如食補）誠是在食品中，含有天然的滋補成分，適合於吾人身體的營養，確有意想不到之效力；同時爲了取給方面的便利，價格方面的低廉，而且味美果腹，一舉數得，因此（食補）的方法，在我們鄉下就流行得很廣，種類也繁衍得很多了。</p>
<p>（一）子花蛋早起敲一個雞子在碗裏，稍加鹽，用沸水冲化即成。這個是鄉下最通行的冬令補品，本來在農業社會裏，雞這種家禽，是每家都飼養着的，當然雞蛋也就大量的生産了。旣不要化錢出去購買，服用方法又很簡單，因此一般鄉下人家，樂於服用，可是爲了農村經濟的窘迫，和都市需要蛋産的高度發展而蛋價飛漲，到近來農民們，也多節省下來，去換取必需的生活費了。</p>
<p>（二）荳腐漿荳腐漿就是用荳攙水磨爛，榨去荳渣，入鍋煑沸即成。如再在腐漿内加石膏或鹽，濾乾壓成塊，就成荳腐成腐干，爲佐食最普通的菜蔬。荳是我們農業國家的主要産品，因此荳的應用也很廣。荳腐店不論在城市或任何小鄉村鎭上，是隨處都有，鄉下人每每在清早，走上荳腐店，只消化上四五個銅板，就好買一碗腐漿，或者帶回家庭裏，浸着油條，荳腐衣，或加些白糖，當做早晨的餐點。腐漿含有很多的蛋白質和澱粉，確實是滋補的佳品。</p>
<p>以上兩樣食補品，在鄉村裏是最廣泛地爲龐大的農民羣所服用的。價廉物美，眞值得介紹給冬令服補劑的朋友們之前，其實仔細想來，我們的金錢眞是千辛萬苦的汗血的代價，在這國難方殷的年頭兒，在這個個人國家經濟一般的恐慌的現象之下，我們又何苦去購用高了十倍或至百倍的舶來藥品呢？</p>
<p>至於比較精緻考究的食補品，也有下列幾種在鄉間流行着，祗是他的價值，比較的昻貴了些，然而和舶來品藥物相較，那也賤得天差地遠了。</p>
<p>（三）年筋一到冬天，鄉下各地就設立了屠牛場，他們將每只牛身上的筋，分别剔出，成爲一付一付的風乾出售，大約每付值價四五元，買來洗凈，用糖，酒，醬油和其他調味的東西，配合煑爛，傾入磁盆内凝凍成膏，食時用刀切成塊，其味醇美，功能强筋健骨，益氣，補精的爲食補品中之珍饌，老壯的人服之，殊爲有益。</p>
<p>（四）童子雞把六七個月的童子雞，去毛，入鍋，隔水蒸爛，稍加食鹽，連湯飲之，雞肉鬆嫩，湯味鮮美，亦爲食補品中上饌。在我們鄉下，一個孩子，到了發育時期，他的家庭方面，就替他拿這麽一件補品給他吃，吃的時候，絶對不准旁人一嘗禁臠，即使是一根骨頭一撮毛，也都得用布包好，深深埋進泥裏，據説假使要給旁人或别的東西吃了，就會分了補去，這又未免是鄉下人的穿鑿附會了。</p>
<p>（五）羊湯羊是熱性動物，因此吃羊肉在冬天是最爲相宜的，羊湯就是把羊肉入鍋煑爛後的湯，把羊肉裏含的滋補成分，給提煉出來，自然羊湯也就是很好的食補之一了。羊湯裏含有很多的燐質和脂肪質，可以滋補腦系，營養細胞，鄉下有（有病發病，無病發身）之謡，體質虚弱的人，不大敢吃，還有羊臊味，胃口不好的，也難下咽，唯有體質本來好的人吃了，是很得益的。　　（藥補不如食補），紅色補丸，維太露，散拿吐瑾……這一類的西藥補品，不過就動植物中加以一次的提煉的手續而已。在我們又何必近乎迷信似的去信任他果眞有什麽特殊功能的滋補成分在内，其實他的效力，還趕不上服用原始的動植物，釀我們身體内各部分器官，自由運用他的機能，去吸收他需要的營養呢！　　服用補劑的朋友們，我們何必去購用舶來的藥品？何必把自己血汗的金錢鉅萬鉅萬的送到國外去呢？我們何不採用價廉物美的）食補）？</p>
<h3>爸爸的棉袍子</h3>
<p>— 賈雲釗</p>
<p>（爸爸！怎麽你的棉袍子這樣破舊了！）松兒怪驕頑的，到了冬天，他看了老父親穿上那件三十年來的土布老棉袍，總要笑着這樣發問：似乎在譏刺父親的吝嗇和窮相！</p>
<p>國卿——松兒的父親，聽了這樣的問話，在不耐煩的時候，有時這樣帶了教誨呵責的口氣説話給松兒聽：</p>
<p>（小傢伙！誰不要體面！……你爸爸這件老棉袍，還是光緒三十一年間做的，七吊錢呢）。</p>
<p>國卿時常依老賣老地教訓他的兒女們；刻板的幾個要點：（一）節儉；（二）用國貨；（三）要聽老人家的話。（四）……　　（你們現在眞愜意！要穿什麽便什麽！其實那些洋貨都是騙人的東西。看我這件棉袍子已穿了三十來件，雖然破舊，不是一樣的穿着嗎？……你們以後要穿什麽衣服，最好像我這樣，買些本國土布，愛國省錢，不是很兩便嗎？……）國卿一到了冬天，他總照例的對兒女們這樣哼着老調，並且指手畫脚地拿起老棉袍給兒女們看。</p>
<p>國卿的幾個大兒女，似乎都受了他的或化與薰陶；然而那孩氣未脱的松兒，每到冬天，總還是這樣驕頑地似乎在嘲笑着爸爸的吝嗇和將相！</p>
<p>現在，爸爸三十年來的老棉袍，每到冬天，還照舊拖拖掛掛的穿在身上！</p>
<p>世界兒童</p>
<h3>小華兒</h3>
<p>— 百子</p>
<p>小華兒自從入了學校以後，眞是愈加惹人歡喜了。那樣的聰敏，那樣的活潑，成爲家庭中快樂的泉源，唯一的珍寳了。他又並不頑皮，天眞之中還帶着學問，有時候能説幾句非常可愛而有理的話。</p>
<p>初冬這一天，小華兒家裏舉行茶話會，許多親戚朋友們都很愉快的到來，聚集在寛敞的客廳上，客廳上裝飾得很清雅。客人們大家吃着茶點，談着笑着。他的父親母親和大哥二姊等都忙忙碌碌地招待，斟茶，遞香烟；小華兒也在人叢中穿來穿去地，這邊呌一聲何家伯伯請坐，又跑過去請王家表哥吃瓜子，到這個人膝上靠一會，又到那個人身邊説兩句話。</p>
<p>（眞像小天使一樣！）客人們都這樣贊美小華兒。他們覺得今天會塲中的空氣，似乎受小華兒一個人的鼓盪而顯得更加歡樂。</p>
<p>餘興開始了，父親致辭以後，接着是二姊跳舞，大哥講笑話，母親也却不過衆人的要求唱了一只歌；有幾位客人也參加了精彩的表演，如小魔術，打拳等。</p>
<p>（我們忘記小天使了！）忽然人羣中有人説，不知是誰。於是便引起了全體拍掌，大家都要小華兒獻一點玩藝。</p>
<p>小華兒立起來了，笑嘻嘻地，先向客人鞠躬，然後説：　　（我一點也不會什麽的。我記得我們老師説過，中國非常危險，因爲同胞們大家不肯用國貨，所以很容易亡國。我聽見了便不快活，亡國不是很痛苦的嗎？所以我要勸大家都用國貨！我現在再唱一曲國貨歌罷：</p>
<p>國貨國貨　　大家愛用國貨　　使我中華永存　　不受亡國痛苦　　大家提倡國貨　　國貨國貨）</p>
<p>於是，這熱閙的茶話會。在掌聲和高呼提倡國貨聲中盡興地結束了。</p>
<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>覺悟了</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>王仲敏先生是一個國貨運動的熱心者，提倡國貨的努力份子，雖然他還是一個年紀二十五歲的青年，但他的忠誠，樓實，不染洋化，確使一般認識王先生的人，深深地欽佩他，時常説：（小王眞是一個言行合一的不可多得的青年。）</p>
<p>這種話，在王先生的耳朶裏，不止聽到一次了，當他每次聽到朋友們贊美他的話時，他終是莞爾一笑，表示又感激又得意的姿態來。不久，在某一個秋天的清晨，當王先生早起洗臉，吃點心時，綠衣使者送來了一封雙掛號信，王先生折開一看，信上這樣的寫着：</p>
<p>仲敏先生台　，敬啟者，數處爲提倡國貨之機關，　來對於國貨運動，莫不參加贊，且力行不怠，以期挽回國人崇拜洋貨之頽風，而爲國貨前途，創造一新生命，此旨諒在先生洞察之中，茲爲擴充業務起見，所請職員，不敷擔任，素仰先生對於國貨，努力提倡，爲特專函奉聘，請擔任敵處宣傳科主任之職，月薪八十元，熱心如先生，當能予以俯允也。專此卽請日安</p>
<p>ＸＸ國貨廠謹上ＸＸ國貨廠謹上Ｘ月Ｘ日</p>
<p>王先生看完了這封信，眞快活得跳起來，因爲他本來的職業，是小學教員，生活非常清淡，同時，他的旨趣，是一個提倡崇拜國貨的忠實份子，</p>
<p>對於這樣一個合於旨趣，而薪水又是豐厚的職位，他是如何的樂意呀？於是，不到一星期，王先生便辭掉了原有的學校的職務，到國貨機關去辦公了！</p>
<p>從此以後，王先生更受人家的贊助了，更受隣居的慕羨了！大家説：（王先生的前途，很在希望，很有發展的。是一個不凡的青年。一</p>
<p>可是，事實不像大衆的推測一般，大家認爲生活愉快的王先生，現在好像不大快活了，面容上時常表示出憂愁的寡歡的樣子，這，在大衆看來，</p>
<p>不能不算是一件奇怪而急於要知道底細的事。</p>
<p>原來王先生的所以不歡，所以不樂，不是無因的，是他的一位尊夫人在作梗呢？</p>
<p>王先生的夫人，顧潔分女士，是一個十足的摩登少奶奶，樣樣東西，都信仰外國貨，身上的衣裳，當然不用説了，她的性情，和王先生之贊成國貨，絶對相反，因此，在王先生未入國貨機關辦事之先，已經屢次勸他了，可是她終是不肯聽從王先生的話。</p>
<p>現在，王先生到國貨機關辦事了，而且担任宣傳方面的事情，時常出去演講，勸人家服用國貨，可是，有一次的演講會裏，却使王先生的心靈上，感到極度的創痛。</p>
<p>在王先生演講（國貨運動與民族復興）的講題以後，有一位聽講者在竊竊私議地和朋友道：（哼！像煞有介事地，講什麽提倡國貨，自己家裏的老婆，也宣傳不好，用的，穿的，都是洋貨，還是一個十足地洋貨推銷員呢？還説什麽………？）</p>
<p>這種話，在王先生聽來，是多麽地刺耳呀！是多麽的痛心啊！</p>
<p>這晚，王先生回去整整地哭了一夜，害得顧女士嚇昏了，安慰也安慰不好，王先哭了半夜三更，顧女士也只得伴着，問他爲什麽哭？爲什麽不如意？有什麽不如意的事，我可以做到的，儘管做到好了，）最後王先生説明了所以哭的原因，同時哭聲更利害了！</p>
<p>顧女士默默地想着，虚榮心與愛夫心，在心房中交戰起來，他想：（假使服從了丈夫，便要改用國貨，假使服用了洋貨，便要使丈夫痛心）最後，她决定了，决定從明天起，一定服用國貨，完成她愛護丈夫的願心，這意旨宣布以後，王先生才快活起來！</p>
<p>眞的，顧女士現在眞的覺悟了，用的，着的，都選用國貨了，從今以後，王先生在會場上説話，也再不聽見有人刺痛他的話了。</p>

<h3>銀價與中國物價水準之關係　路易士張履鸞作</h3>
<p>有一部分人士、相信假使美國與其他美洲國家、能採用白銀做貨幣、銀的購買力旣可增高、間接就無異於提高中國在世界市塲之購買力、但就事實而論、却處處與之相反、增高白銀價格、反使中國内部的物價水準逐漸降低、巨烈的經濟不景氣現象、在中國也就卽時發生、外貨進口、當然更要减少了、</p>
<p>中國的物價水準降落、始自一九三一年的五月、此時正在世界白銀購買力開始增高的時候、到了現在、中國已經顯出很嚴重的經濟不安現象、假使中國欲免除此種不景氣現象、似可採用一種商品貨幣制、其中所含銀的數量、可隨時變動、以維持其物價的穏定</p>
<p>（一）白銀價格增高中國物價水準低降除少數限制外、白銀在世界上佔極重要的市塲、在外國的任何因素、凡影響於增高白銀之購買力的不久在中國也每有同等的趨勢發現、因爲中國是一銀本位國家、故白銀購買力增高、可在其批發物價降低上觀察而出、反之、白銀購買力降低、中國批發物價卽又高漲、</p>
<p>若用一九一○至一九一四年爲基期、於一八八七年時白銀之購買力、在英國爲二○九·五、在中國爲二○九·二、在一九三○年時、白銀之購買力在英國降低到五七·九、在中國六○三、一直到了一九三一年、白銀的購買力才開始增高若將一九三二年白銀購買力全年平均、其結果在中國爲六七·五、在英國爲六九·一、在於以上的時期中、除歐戰時期不計外、英國白銀購買力之降低趨勢、常與中國白銀購買力互相平衝而接近、在此時期以前、中國的白銀購買力指數常比英國遲緩一年、但是在歐戰以後、兩者相差就很微了、</p>
<p>在歐戰以前、上海國定税則委員會曾刊印有上海每月的批發物價指數、由一九二四年起、天津南開大學經濟學院又有華北每月批發物價指數的刊行、若以此種每月批發物價指數與英國美國由一九二一年起之白銀購買力每月指數相比較、可以顯然告訴我們、凡當國外白銀購買力增高時、中國國内的批發物價指數、於同時内卽行低降、反之亦然、</p>
<p>吾人果能詳察兩者相差之趨勢、白銀購買力在國外大約每月最高之指數、常與中國每月批發物價指數相對峙、考其關係至爲密切、惟在英國與美國放棄金本位時、中國批發物價指數與英美兩國之白銀購買力指數相對之趨勢、不甚明顯、</p>
<p>迄一九三一年中、世界白銀購買力逐漸、增高同時中國物價水準也就逐漸降低、若以一九二六年爲基期在一九三一年時、中國華北物價指數高至一二五、上海高至二三○、到了一九三三年七八月的時候、中國的批發物價指數、忽然降到與基期一九二六年相同的物價水準、而同時英國白銀的購買力指數、亦由一九三一年的最低點增到與基期一九二六年的指數幾站相等、</p>
<p>（二）白銀購買力似有繼續增高的趨勢</p>
<p>在世界各項物品中、近年來因爲白銀産量之增加較慢、銀數變爲鎔銀出售之事、實由九國銀公約加以阻止、且他國或有採取一部分白銀、充作貨幣之可能、白之購買力、以後頗有逐漸增高之趨勢、</p>
<p>細討白銀購買力所以降低之原因、是因爲在一八八七至一九三一年這個時期、世界上有多數國家、採取金本位制、不用白銀做他的貨幣、同時鎔銀出售以至少數仍用銀本位之國家、供過於求、故價大跌、在一九○二至一九二二年中放棄銀本位的國家甚多、所以中國的物價水準的增加、同時與存銀數量的增加率相同、近年以來、鎔銀出售量更見增加、直到了一九三一年九月間爲止、中國的物價的增高率反比世界存銀增加率來得更快、（未完）</p>

<h3>菊與義勇軍</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>這一個月來，你若有興，到鄉間去走一遭，所帶回來的印象，總無非是溪邊是菊，籬下是菊，花圃裏是菊，茅坑旁也是菊。的確，在這一個季節裏，菊也是眞太普遍了。不拘你走到怎一位家裏，庭心裏，花盆裏，多少總也點綴着幾株菊。再説得規模小一些，那麽，花瓶裏插着的也是菊。没有花瓶的，也得在鹽菜瓶裏浸着疎疎地幾株花頭都已垂倒了的菊。不信，請走進商塲，或娛樂塲，也無不於所入口處，以及走廊裏，或是茶几上，安置盆栽着的菊。甚至寗波飯店，無錫麵館，天津鍋貼店，廣東宵夜館裏，也都陳列着二三盆的菊。因了在這一季裏，其餘的名花奇卉，都因不耐寒冷而凋萎了，所以菊佔了這大的地位，於是菊就被人十分重視，（譽爲孤芳獨賞），（傲骨嶙峋），（有高士風）。不過在這年頭兒，不拘甚麽，都得來一個積極。假使因了入世的煩惱，而逃禪遁世，這種頽廢，消極的人生觀，是不可爲訓的。所以我以爲把這些風雅之至的大帽子，戴上（菊）的頭，是不合潮流的。依找的管見，（菊），倒與奮鬥絶塞的義勇軍，處着相同的地位，顯着相似的精神。</p>
<p>義勇軍在正式軍隊撤退之後活動，菊在百花凋萎之後開放，這是相同之點一。義勇軍不畏强暴，菊不畏秋風，這是相同之點二。義勇軍有給養可戰，無給養，亦可戰，菊經灌溉能開花，不經灌溉，亦能開花，這是相同之點三。義勇軍無孔不入，菊遍地皆是，這是相同之點四。義勇軍受創之後，能散而復合，菊枯萎之後，翌年復茁新芽，這是相同之點五。義勇軍愈戰愈多，菊枝愈剪愈密，這是相同之點六。</p>
<p>最後，還有一層，菊雖能點綴了秋色，却不能及於春夏冬三季，正如義勇軍雖能奮鬥努力，終不能恃以收復淪陷的山河。這竟可説菊與義勇軍的命運，同樣地含着血與涙。</p>
<h3>西湖袁公墩露宿隨筆</h3>
<p>— 竹林</p>
<p>鐘聲響後，中隊長來到我們營帳前，敦促我們換崗守夜。從略有熱意的被窩中鑽出了營帳，帳外寒氣直侵睡眼朦朧的我們。被派在湖邊崗位上的我，無力的支着那根童子軍的木棍。但還没有如此的安適。因爲夜來的風，格外冷得刺骨，就是睡着也要醒的，何况是朦朧的我呢？袁公墩是四面皆水，除了我們黑黝黝的蓬賬外，什麽都没有。轉到司令帳前，中間也祇有一盞紅而淡的燈吧了。湖中呢，沉靜極了。一艘遊艇也没有，人聲是隔絶的，祗有大而且低的波浪聲，不知那裏來的風響聲吧了。對岸高山已不見，祇有山脚了的路燈，和東面新市塲傳來的幾千百條河水映成的光柱，微微的顫動。</p>
<p>鐘聲再響了，悠揚的聲音盤旋在墩的周圍樹木之中，再轉後似乎已散去。但是在我的耳中還繼續聽到長而且低的回音。精神又沉下去，心中數着數目，想消去寒冷的磨折。</p>
<p>傳來好音的鐘又響了。四周沉寂中又在發聲了。步伐聲，呌子聲，不久調崗了。來的那個人用啞的聲音招呼了我一聲。我很快樂，離開那抖顫着的朋友。再進那已冷的被窩中。但比外面好得多了。於是再也不聽見鐘聲，死沉沉的營帳中祇有平匀的呼吸聲罷了。</p>
<h3>女性是食品</h3>
<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>男性爲什麽愛好女性？因爲伊們的全身，都是好吃的東西，而且大半是甘美芬芳的鮮菓，那得不使男性饞涎欲滴，盡力追求呢，倘若不信，待我來略舉如后：　　杏靨　　　　　　　　　　梨渦　　桃顋　　　　　　　　　　藕臂　　膽鼻（非大英雄不敢當膽）春葱　　櫻脣　　　　　　　　　　酥胸　　丁香　　　　　　　　　　粉腿　　貝粒　　　　　　　　　　蓮鉤（現在應改爲蓮船了）</p>
<h3>療病……療魚</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>家母氣體素虧，日來病痢甚劇，延中西名醫診治者已不下十餘人。西醫名之曰（細菌性赤痢），主用施針中醫稱之謂（噤口痢），擬方而藥都噁吐不能下喉。十日來，非但不見鬆動，反日益沉重，惟神志始終清明，瑣屑家事，喃喃叮嚀，不自知其將不起也，家人通宵侍奉，不佞亦五六日未能合眼，困憊已極，每見老母呻吟，恨不能以身代之。蘇地名醫不謂不多，我儕亦不能謂不肯化錢，無如中醫嫉西，西醫妬中，公説公理，婆説婆理，我等悉聽指揮，而我母痛未减退，恐將成爲中西醫鬥法之標的。噫亦難矣！諺云：藥忌亂投，但人子之心，何忍坐視，究不知爲醫家之欠高明，抑我母病患不治耶？實不得而知之矣。</p>
<p>金魚，爲不佞二十年來最心愛之物，近且集合同志，設魚樂國於滬西海格路。養魚能識其性，初非難養，但遇黄霉，則亦每易感病。嘗有人見問：何以購魚不一二日即僵？此實未識其性也。金魚不分種别，如能置之於空氣清爽陽光照澈之區；有多量之水，再給以有分寸之食料，則已萬無一失，設遇魚病，亟宜另移空缸，以待其愈，切忌任其自然，則全缸之魚，可以立盡。到鑒别病魚之能否再生，視魚身色澤可知。蓋病魚而色之較原來黯淡，則必死無疑，反之則可以救治，此則不侫所經騐者也，自誇較之蘇地醫家之治病，稍有見地，雖人與魚之間，差别太遠，惟其理則一也兒好像没有這樣好運氣，説得更甚些，伊——模特兒還不如西冷橋頭蘇小小幾根骨值錢，這是多麽傷心事呀！</p>
<p>當我每回拿着一幀完成了的畫走出畫室時，又回頭看着精神疲勞的模特兒，心裏總覺有幾分悲酸，我想：假如自己在藝術上有一絲成功處，至少有一半是從那可憐的伊的身上掠奪來的。</p>
<h3>人體畫室</h3>
<p>— 符一葉</p>
<p>大槪到了天氣寒冷的時候，石膏，靜物等畫室裏面，人數總較少些，最閙熱的便是人體畫室，因爲這兒有熱烘烘的火爐，本來就是不在這裏作畫的也愛進來拷火取暖，尤其是當下課休息十分鐘，簡直像拜火教的教徒們那樣興奮，立刻在爐子的周遭築起一道人身的墻壁。</p>
<p>這十分鐘的休息，我常常感到快樂，原因是得把僵硬的手兒烘温一點，並且得在教室内打個轉身看看别人的畫，再如走回自己的畫架前面來，看見今天的色調田得那些：那就更加高興了。彫刻家羅丹説：最上的快樂，是當看了自己的工作做得很好的時候。這話委實有道理。</p>
<p>但是，我們的模特兒伊是那樣頸抖地支撑固有的姿勢，讓我們慢慢地工作，伊的常大而高貴的犧牲，自然不是每天一塊幾毛錢的代價所能報償的。可是，在事實上常常這樣矛盾：有一幅畫完成時，那最高的價值却不屬於模特兒而是整個的屬於畫家了。全部美術史上我們祇曉得達，文西，孤柏，大衛的光榮聲譽，誰知道給他們爲藝術品模型的模特兒呢？</p>
<p>自然詩人和風景畫家們，歌咏描寫某個本來不是十分美妙的湖山，那湖山的聲譽倒增高而永留於千古，如勃朗寗之於蒲爾志湖，歌剛之於大溪地島，王塵詰之於輞川，但同操爲藝術對象的模特</p>
<h3>東北四連長張恨水　第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</h3>
<p>趙翁説畢，他就在裏屋小桌上，將紙筆墨硯搬了出來，放到外面大桌子上，打開硯池，站着桌子邊就擂起墨來。臉還朝了江氏笑道：自然像自强這種人，舊式結婚，他是不肯的。就是你家大姑娘我想他也會喜歡文明結婚，第一是音樂隊合花馬車，共要五十元。多派一點，就是六十元罷。新娘子蒙頭紗，我們省儉就是賃罷，不用買了，反正祗用那一會兒。我們家裏人錢少，當然是借飯莊子來辦。你看怎麽樣呢？他一面説着，一面擂墨，現出那迫不及待的神氣。江氏僅僅祗説了讓趙自强請假回來，其餘的千頭萬緒的事，一句還没有提到，這老頭子就要開喜事賬單了。這些事情，自己實在也不曾想到，却呌自己怎樣的回復呢？便笑道：這些事情都好辦，祗要面子上遇得去，咱們是愛親結親，那還有什麽可説的？趙翁是一頭高興，聽了這話，臉上兩團喜氣洋洋的紅暈，立刻收了起來，淡淡的笑道：這些事，總也是要辦的，遲早免不了商量。他如此説着時，揑着在硯池擂的墨也就停止不動了。江氏一看，自己的話，未免對人家大爲掃興，便笑道：老太爺總是這樣熱心，不像我們婦道拖泥帶水。您説的這話，您就託上罷。先託上也好，咱們想起一樣，就先託上一樣，不到日子，什麽事都辦得全全備備了將來到了那日子，您可以放着心多喝兩杯喜酒。趙翁手摸了鬍子笑道；我的意思，可不就是如此嗎？説到這裏，他臉上又有點喜色了慢慢的坐到桌子邊那張圍椅上去，然後提起筆來，就向硯臺去虀墨。（二六七）</p>

<h3>上海烏話（上）</h3>
<p>— 均</p>
<p>楔子圖書館的揭示牌，高高地繫着新到書藉的封皮，其中那一本題名爲“Shanghai　Bird”的洋書，它的封面和名字，都吸引我的注意，於是從書庫裏把它請了出來，那是一本10X6大二英寸厚的來路貨，綠色的封皮，鑲着金的書名，滿神氣的。我一口氣地把它從頭到尾翻過，原來是上海鳥類的調查報告書。啊，眞費神了洋大人這樣地詳細把上海的鳥調查出來。這算什麽？來中國調查鳥的何只本書作者一人呢，據作者緒論中説：來中國調查鳥的，而且著有十餘萬言的書的，計法人有兩位，英人有三位，德人一位，美人二位。可是我們這些主人翁，因爲了已有人代辦了，也免了這許多麻煩。</p>
<p>上海鳥之定義</p>
<p>因爲各地氣候之不同，環量之各異，所以其出産物也因之而異。上海有上海的環景與氣候，所以上海也有它的特産物。鳥的生活和氣候環景大有關係，所以各地方有各地方的鳥。但鳥會飛的，上海的鳥，如果高興的話，也不妨去南京一趟，南京的鳥同時也得到上海來玩，所以上海鳥這名詞，是非常空泛的，可是現在我們找個定義了，是：（凡常住在上海，或上海常見到的鳥，統名爲上海鳥。）</p>
<p>上海鳥之種類</p>
<p>（一）默鳥體槪黑，雄之嘴及眼皆橙黄褐色，脚略帶黑。雌的胸腹褐色，頥帶白色，胸部污褐，有暗色斑紋，嘴脚皆褐，長約十寸半（英寸），呌的聲音爲“Tzik-Taik”聲。</p>
<p>（二）鶯長約八寸，頭頂毛係黑色，頸及腹毛係白色，翼及背係綠灰色，呌的聲音非常悦耳，大槪分爲四種：唱時作“Shokuji-Shokuji-Shokuji'Eoready”聲，向異性調情，或向敵人示威，作“Chee-OO-Chee-OO-ChenOO-Chee-OＯ”聲，饑餓或向同伴警告時，聲甚粗，並拍翼作嚮。</p>
<p>（三）鵛又名黄道眉，雄者身體槪作褐色，有光澤，羽及嘴部有黑色條紋，頰眉皆白，耳羽是黑。體下面淡赤帶褐，雌者體頰眉皆黄，耳翼暗褐，體下面淡褐，長約六寸，鳴聲作“Tzirrip”聲。鵐有峋鵐，赤鵐，田鵐，雪鵐之分。</p>
<p>（四）水鴨羽作黑色，腹旁作棕灰色，腿及足作暗紅色，長約十六寸，嘴尖約有寸半長，見於初夏及深秋時。</p>
<p>（五）鳥鴉色黑而較大，嘴强直，且嘴根具剛毛，被覆鼻孔，體之上面黑色，翼之基部暗色，有綠光，脚較細，黑色，四趾踏地，趾端有鈎爪，雄之發音器有特異之鳴筯，體長一尺八寸。　　（六）鳲鳩又名布榖，長一尺，長幼異色，長成者羽色與杜鵑殆無區别，唯體稍大，又胸腹之横行黑條甚細，闊只半分。幼者體上面從頭至尾槪呈赤茶色，有多敵黑横斑，但腰腹無之，體下面從頥至尾根帶淡黄之色，與長成者之色同。鳴聲作“Cuck-Cuck-Coo</p>
<p>（七）杜鵑眼臉黄，嘴路彎曲，嘴根黄色，尖端暗色，體上及頰爲灰黑，體下白色，多暗色之横條紋，尾亦灰，當初夏則晝夜哀鳴，有時陰夜飛鳴於空中，人多聞之。</p>

<h3>青年作家</h3>
<p>— 小卒</p>
<p>幾年以前，某小説商刊印什麽青年作家叢書，大登廣告，説是爲無名作家謀出路。一個朋友，寄了一部稿子去，回信説了許多讚揚的話，並聲明不久可以付印。後來，再去一封信，問版税和預支的事，想不到竟惹起他的惱怒。回信大駡一頓，説替青年作家印書，是賠本的買賣，自己也不看看自己的東西究竟值錢不值錢，就來説什麽板税，預支，大有青年作家太不識抬舉的意思：最後的話，是如果要錢，就將稿子退回。</p>
<p>在這一次的經騐裏，我知道青年的無名作家，要想擠上文壇，實在不是容易的事，至少他們的血，先要釀出版家吸一個飽。　　近來又碰到類似的事。一個朋友把創作寄給一個以提拔新進作家爲職志之一的某文藝雜誌。他怕編輯先生不看就扔，特地請了與總編輯相識的人寫一封信附在裏面。雖然聲明希望快回信，但回信是没有的。經過幾次的催促，一個月以上的時間，稿子是被雜誌社派人送回了。不但原封未拆，就是寫收稿人地名人名的籤條也未換一張，大槪因爲最後一行寫了寄稿人的姓名地址，雜誌社落得省省事吧。這位朋友弄得莫名其妙，當衆拆開，原來介紹信也依舊的躺在那裏。這才確定的知道編輯先生，並未賜閲，而原封奉還。可是這一雜誌，每期上總有一兩篇新進作家的創作。</p>
<p>這又一回的經騐，使我懂得青年作家，除去那直接吸血者，還有帮兇的人，用着提拔青年作家的美名做幌子，來增加雜誌在青年讀者間的銷路，來讓自己和老闆名利雙收。</p>
<p>所謂每期仍有新的稿子者，依我想，不是青年作家與編輯先生有特種的關係：定然是在喝了（温醇的酒）之餘，編輯先生偶而興發，抽籤似的拿上一兩篇消遣消遣，無意中發現的。那麽，青年作家的命運，和買（航空奬劵）得頭彩，可謂並不二樣，是全靠（機會）了。</p>
<p>在這樣的情形之下　，我們的青年作家，究竟向何處去呢？</p>
<h3>仙霞紀險（續）</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>我們照這樣的搜尋空屋，搜尋了好幾處，纔找到了一所基幹隊駐剳在那裏的處所。守衛的兵士，對我們起初當然也是很含有疑懼的一番打量，聽了我們的許多説明之後，他纔開口説：（昨晚上又有謡言，居民是自從去年九月以來，早就搬走了。在這裏要吃一頓飯，是很不容易，因爲豆腐青菜都没有人做。但今天早晨，隊長是已經接到了江山胡站長的信，令大約總在預備了罷？）説了，就請我們上大廳去息息。我們看到了這一種情形，聽到了那一番話，食慾早就被恐怖打倒了，所以道了一聲隊長萬福，跳上車子，轉身就走。</p>
<p>重回到小竿嶺的那個隘口的時候，幾刻鐘前曾經盤問我們過，幸虧有了陳萬里先生的那個徽章證明，纔安然放我們過去的那位捧大刀的守衛兵，却笑着對我們説：（你們就回去了麽？）回來一過此口，已經入了安全地帶，我們的膽子也大起來了，就在龍溪邊上，一處呌作大塢的溪橋旁邊下了車，打算爬上山去，親眼去看一看那座也可以説是一夫當關，萬夫莫開，宋史浩方把石路舖起來的仙霞關口。一面，呌空車子仍遵原路，繞到仙霞關北相去五里的保安村去等候我們，好讓我們由關南上嶺，關北下山，一路上看看風景。</p>
<p>據書上的記載，則仙霞嶺高三百六十級，凡二十四曲，有五關，Ｘ十峯等等，我們因爲是從半腰裏上去的，所以所走的只是關門所在的那一段。</p>
<p>仙霞關，前前後後，有四個關門。第二關的邊上，將近頂邊的地方，有一座新築的碉樓在那裏，據陪我們去游的胡站長説，江山近旁，其有碉樓四十餘處，是新近纔築起來的，但汽車路一開，道些碉樓，這座雄關，將來怕都要變成些虚有其名的古蹟了。</p>
<p>仙霞關内嶺頂，有一座霞嶺亭，亭旁住着一家人家，從前大約是守關官吏的住所，現在却只剩了一位老人，在那裏賣茶給過路的行人。</p>
<p>北面出關，下嶺里許，是一個關帝廟。規模很大，有觀音閣，浣霞池亭等建築，大約從前的閩浙官吏來往，總是在這廟内寄宿的無疑。現在東面浣霞池的亭上，還有許多周亮工的過關詩，以及清初諸名宦的唱和詩碣，嵌在石壁的中間。</p>
<p>在關帝廟裏喝了一碗茶，買了些有名的仙霞關的綠茶茶葉，晚霞已經圍住了山腰，我們的手上臉上都感覺得有點潮潤起來了，大家就不約而同的呌了出來説：</p>
<p>（啊！原來這些就是仙霞！不到此地，可眞不曉得這關名之妙喂！）</p>
<p>下嶺過溪，走到溪旁的保安村裏，坐上車子，再探頭出來看了一眼曾經我們走過的山嶺，這座東南的雄鎭，却早己羞羞怯怯，躱入到一片白茫茫的仙霞懷裏去了。</p>
<h3>星子</h3>
<p>— 衛增本</p>
<p>夜裏！没有星子，没有光亮。</p>
<p>一個人，在黑暗裏趕路，寂寞地……幾時才能找到合適的下宿處，幾時才能安定一安定那疲乏到死的靈魂呢？</p>
<p>（然而是在夜裏啊！没有星子，没有光亮。）</p>
<p>哦，謝謝天！在黑暗的夜裏，居然看到一粒令人喜悦的光亮的星子了。雖説是在遼遠的那方，閃着微弱的光輝呢，可是，却逗着一個疲乏到死的靈魂起了温暖，知道自己並不是在黑暗寂寞的旅程中。</p>
<p>…喲！那光亮的星子呢？似乎有一隻從闇黑中升起來的黑暗的觸手，把這不幸的星子吞食了！於是：</p>
<p>前面！黑茫茫的霧。後面！黑茫茫的霧。</p>
<p>夜里！没有星子，没有光亮。一個人，在黑暗裏趕路，寂寞地…幾時才能找到合適的下宿處。幾時才能安定一安定那疲乏到死的靈魂呢？（然而是在夜裏呵！没有星子，没有光亮。）</p>
<p>哦，謝謝天！在黑暗的夜裏，現在居然又看到一粒令人喜悦的光亮的星子了。雖説是在遼遠的那方，可是，却閃着火燄似的光輝呢！這星子，將會升起火燄似的觸手把黑暗吞食了的罷？</p>
<h3>覆侍桁先生</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>侍桁先生：</p>
<p>我的錯誤的意見，又承你詳細指正，不獨使我茅塞頓開，卽許多研究藝術問題的（自由談）諧者亦受賜多多矣。我早就説過，自己不曾研究文藝，我只是根據一點平凡的道理，來和你討論。現在在你的指教之下，我很想放棄我的對於藝術的謬見，可是這樣一來，就非把那一點平凡的道理根本推翻不可，但這是我所不能的。因此，我只得仍把和尊見（衝突）的謬見保持下去。要是黎烈文先生和一般讀者允許把更多的自由談的篇幅讓給這問題，那麽也許我還可以和先生詳細討論一番，因爲經這麽一刺激，我已有了研究文藝之志了。然而，在還没有得到這種允許之前，我仍然只能簡短地答覆你幾句。</p>
<p>我和你的衝突是根本的，這在你這次的文章裏説得很簡單分明，你説我的意思，好像是説；（决定藝術的是先有著一種與藝術毫無關係的東西存在着），對呀，我確實是這樣承認的，而且這（東西）還可以分明地説出來，便是（社會底存在）。而且，這並不是與藝術毫無關係，二者是有着上層構造與基礎構造的决定的關係的。據這見解，藝術乃是表現所與的社會的。但據你的意見，則藝術是獨立的東西，表現在藝術裏的現實是另一種（現實），與社會的地存在着的現實無關。在我看來，這是一種有點玄妙的唯心的理論。</p>
<p>我不曾説過藝術是現實的（絲毫不加變形原封不動的移用）的話，我也不曾把（藝術的表現）置於（現實的認識）以次的地位。只在你把藝術製作力誇張成上帝的創造力一般的偉大的時候，我曾比較地説過與其偏重藝術的表現倒不如偏重現實的認識的話。（刻鵠）（畫虎）的比喻，我仍然認爲適當的，倘要畫虎像虎，刻鵠像鵠，我也以爲必須認識與表現同樣正確。我的本意，是説明認識與表現的程序不同，我以爲認識先於表現，而存在又先於認識，倘無存在，則無從認識，更無從表現　；　　，　　解釋（我思，故我在）這樣語似的，説；（肉　不在沙寗和巴札洛夫是否曾經社會的地存在過，而在，那表現在藝術作品中的沙寗和巴札洛夫是否有社會的地存在的可能，不是因爲沙寗是社會的地不存在而稱之爲幻想的人物的，也不是因爲巴札洛夫是社會的地存在的而稱之爲典型人物的。）藝術的表現，能使未必曾經社會的地存在過的人物有社會的地存在的可能，這是我所百思莫得其解的事，除非相信藝術家眞是上帝，藝術眞是至上的法寳。　　你曲解我的觀察法之處，也頗不小。譬如關於寳玉，黛玉，吉訶德，漢烈特，據我的説法，這些都是社會的地存在過的，但並不一定姓賈或姓林，爲騎士，或爲王子，其部分的性狀，也未必全是如此，不過其主要之點，却代表着一個或許多現實的人物，正唯其如此，故爲典型。而你，却相信我是認定曹雪芹，莎士比亞所寫的都是信史了。我是愚笨的，但尚未至此。</p>
<p>撇開了對於個人的誤會曲解的枝節，到了現在，經過你的一再申説，問題已經水落石出，原來我們的意見是各從不同的立塲出發而相（衝突）的。這使我很欣慰，因爲這樣，我們的討論纔還有點意思。衝突不是一件壞事，只要不是黑夜裡不辨彼此自相殘殺。現在，你我的論辯，已不是你我兩人之事，而涉及了藝術論上兩大相反的理論的衝突，也可以説是兩大根本原理的衝突了。</p>
<p>這種衝突，不始於今日，問題是實已很舊，而且被闡發得很明白，在大衆中間有了定論的了。嚴格地説來，給與這問題的我們的紙筆和（自由談）的篇幅，已經有點浪費了。</p>
<p>但是，關於藝術怎樣地影響社會這事，尚擬另撰專文請教。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（五八）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李縱克譯</p>
<p>最先下來的那對少年男女，快快地跑着，突然他們從路旁一條給人在半路上休息的木凳上瞧見一串清水從岸壁的一個小洞裏流出。這這清水起初注人它自己掘成的一個臉盆大小的凹地，隨後便成爲僅僅兩尺高的瀑布落下，穿過那長着一片水芹的仄徑逃去，隨後又穿過那高起的堆着亂石的平原，消失在荆棘和草叢裏。</p>
<p>（啊！我口渴得要命了，陸醉米太太呌説。）</p>
<p>可是怎樣喝呢？她試着用手心去掬，但水從指縫裏溜走了。哲安有了一個主意，他把一塊石頭放在路上；她跪在那石頭上面，這樣她竟可以把嘴唇凑着泉口去喝，因爲她跪着，她的嘴唇便恰和泉口一樣高了。　　當她抬起頭來時，她的臉上，頭髮上，睫毛上，衣上都蓋滿了晶瑩的水珠。哲安彎下身子對她低低地説道：</p>
<p>（你多麽美麗啊）！</p>
<p>她以一種責駡小孩子的語調回答道：</p>
<p>（你願意給我閉住嘴嗎）？</p>
<p>這便是他們最初交換的稍稍含有媚意的話語。</p>
<p>（喂），哲安狠慌亂的説，（趕快走罷，不要讓他們追着）。</p>
<p>眞的，他瞧見那倒退着下來，以便把兩手扶着羅蘭媽媽的博齊汝船長的背，現在就在他們後而了：稍高一點，稍遠一點的地方，羅蘭始終讓自己往下面溜着，他把身子縮在袴裏，像龜似的用手和脚在地上爬着，筆爾則在他前面監視着他的動作。</p>
<p>這仄徑没有以前那樣險峻了，現在變成了一種傾斜的道路，園繞着以前從山上崩落下來的那些大堆大堆的石頭。陸太太和哲安開始跑起來，祇一會兒便到了沙灘上。他們穿過沙灘向那些礁石跑去。這些礁石散佈在一片蓋着海草的長而平的地面，這地面有着無數水蕩閃亮着。退潮的海在那邊，隔得狠遠，在這有海草粘人的平原的後面，海面光綠而又黝黑。</p>
<p>哲安把袴脚捲到腿腹上面，把衣袖捲到齊肘彎，以便放心下水，隨後他説道：（向前）！便毅然跳入最先遇到的那瀦水裏。　　那少婦雖也决定立刻下水，可是比較的謹愼，她畏怯地在那小沼周圍走着，因爲她在有粘性的植物上站不穏脚。</p>
<p>（你看見有什麽東西嗎）？她説。</p>
<p>（我看見你的面孔映在水裏）。</p>
<p>（假如你祗看見這個，那你不會有好的捕蝦成績了）。　　他以一種温柔的聲音低低地説：</p>
<p>（啊！我寗願什麽都不捕，單單捕着這個就好了）。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>健美的女性</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>標示着（墨索里尼希特拉嘉奬）的性的教育，與乎（普及神秘裸體運動）相混合着吹捧而開映出來的（健美的女性），據説是轟動一時，吸引了四五萬以上的（仕女）觀衆。這無論其爲性的教育所招致，或者是（神秘裸體運動）所引誘，總而言之，統而言之，女子的曲線美和肉體起着絶大的宣傳作用，爲無可諱言的事實。足見女性的健與美在中國由男母提倡，惹起了女性的熱心向往的表露。</p>
<p>有健美女性，斯有快樂女家庭，有快樂家庭，才能産生强壯國民；與乎（家齊而後國治），有此而使男子篤實從公，百業俱興政治上軌，中國獨立自由之道斯在於此！健美女性的倡導者這樣的宣示。這與大開其運動會國術比賽的提倡者，揭　有强健身體，斯有强壯事業，健全民族，方足以言禦敵抵抗一樣的（振振有辭）。彷彿十指纎纎瘦不勝衣弱不經風的卓文君林黛玉，就是目前失地損失的根源，而非大興以掃蕩不可。不過雖説這由男倡女和的女性健美運動，有聲有勢，似無疑義，然其流弊所所在，與有若何時代的寓意，殊有（檢討）的必要。</p>
<p>現刻的（摩登）女郎顯然是將這舶來的（健美）二字認爲是與戀愛離婚結婚自由一樣增進女子地位，而成爲女子無限光榮來承受着。如果有人讚美某女士有健康的美，便成了她值得誇耀驕傲的天賦，但從别方面來實際考察，進電影院看了好萊塢的大腿酥胸，霞飛路上見着白俄婦女袒露顫動的乳頭，提倡健美的文士，就涎沬俱垂的讚譽：西洋女子富有健康美；搢紳巨賈之有特别嗜好者，往虹口日本（居亭）一遊，法租界外國年青女子（按摩院）一逛，過屠門而大嚼之後，也撚鬚舐嘴的歎服：（外國人的體格）究竟不同。可是殘花敗柳終歸不能滿足，回來對着文弱不勝工愁善病的滿堂妻妾，也覺掃興，中國人身體太瘦弱不了行，於是（提倡健美）。這就成了（健美）之不爲女子提高自己社會地位發展女子事業，爲女子自己所推進；而成了男子滿足肉慾的追求來提倡來吹捧的現象。因之應爲女子增進地位事業的（健美）運動，在這（太阿倒持）的狀况下，除了在商店機關多增加許多（花瓶）（高射砲）（坦克車）（標凖美人）及明星交際花等而外，不見對女子有何益處。</p>
<p>有人説：封建社會的生活是靜的，所以男子對於女性美的要求是嬌弱文雅貞靜，資本社會的生活是動的冒險的，所以布爾的男子要求壯健活潑的女性美。這是（健美）的在女界中風糜一時的（所以然），其實這一見解不見得是（中其要肯）。原因就在現刻的中國社會在内憂外患之下，其生活，不見得能（動）出甚麽前途，若（冒險）非其所願，且非所能，在（安）（攘）不得的憂患下，前途是已經被决定了，因之（得飲酒時且飲酒，得風流處且風流），享樂，享樂，第三還是享樂。蕭伯納描述拿破崙説（英國人做事總要説出一番大道理來），我們又何常不聰明呢：於是代替了（肉感）（曲線美）（裸體運動），提倡女子體育發展女性的（健美）轉動就這樣表演出來。</p>
<p>但是，因噎廢食惡病諱醫，遠非我們憤世嫉俗的仕女所當採取，健壯（健則美）的身體確爲我國女子所需要，只是在女性的（健美運動中），在環境與個人方面注意；一，在求自身的獨立，增高女子社會地位，發展自己事業的目的下，來煆煉自己的身體，由女子主動自發的提倡（健美）轉動；二，在本身方面作個思想的（解放），勿以（健美）來作達到女子（某種野心）的手段，當然也得給那些男士希圖以提倡女性（健美）達到（某種野心）的伎倆以回駁。</p>
<p>這樣也許才能由男子手裏將欣賞玩亞的（女性健美運動），奪在女子手裏，使成爲自己與社會奮鬥的（女性健美運動）。也許才能將（健美的女性），給電影院作（性的教育）和（普及神秘裸體運動）滑天下之大稽的廣告宣傳的資料了吧。</p>
<h3>如此奮鬥</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>據説現在的生活圈子窄狹極了，以致相當於從前的翰林舉子的大學生，也往往没有出路，不由你不漫遊餓鄉，甚至有些一時氣憤起來，晚上就睡不着，必要服點安眠藥；臨近江邊，轆轆的肚腸狂呌，脚跟發起軟來，濁水也能飽肚吧，於是就跳下江去；至若大學生當綁匪，攔路洗刦，那是英雄好漢的事了；就是操下業，拉黄包車，充特役，也還馬而虎之，不能謂非主路</p>
<p>我自然是更應觸霉頭，因爲我還没有在大學畢業啦。</p>
<p>然而我舍不得死，下業也不甘貿操，我還想奮鬥。</p>
<p>然而我又不懂得怎樣去奮鬥。</p>
<p>於是便去請教一位（此道彌精）的葛先生。</p>
<p>葛先生原也不過是位大學畢生，只是他確乎經過一番猛力的奮鬥，現在是成功之列了。他倒也並不寳藏興焉秘而不宣，我的請益的態度，也許誠懇，承他指點得很是周詳。</p>
<p>葛先生説，方法很繁，却也很簡，在在，在御用得法，大略可區分爲在學與出校的兩個時期，也就是奮鬥的兩大歷程，兩大步驟。</p>
<p>有些人説，在學的時候，學業儘可馬虎，這是錯誤，應該是學業儘可敷衍，敷行是與馬虎異義的，馬虎是題明的撒爛污，敷衍才是自己又輕鬆，無損令譽的辦法。比如説，讀外國文説要運用它看書，繙譯，那是大可不必，只要學得順口，開得來嘴。對於道，我是曾經使過一番苦力的，旁的功課都丢開，每早跑到樹下去練音，結果在英語論説比賽席上，校長親手捧送我一座大銀盾，我更運用兩句熟練的英語感謝他一番。上課我都失望，不過實在説，我是在看電影説明或寫情書，課卷我也有繳，都是預備托人辦好了的。這樣，在學業上，教師都説我是很賣力的，實際上我也就匀出了多少閒空去活動各種的會社，去找教師們閒談聨歡，去到校外參加政治運動。畢業臨了，校長就首先請我去ＸＸ機關帮忙。</p>
<p>出校以後，奮鬥的範圍更廣博了。於是公餘之暇，第一步，我就致力於著述，暫編一部（名人言論），自己下點成本付印，印成了就開始奉贈，凡名人皆送一部，裏面並附一信，道舊兼請教，不外是曾親面教，幸慶三生，現在鄙人編了一部書，還祈不吝指正等語。書旣廣贈出去了，於是嘴上便常常説，某市長是我的朋友，某博士也是我的朋友，等而下之，什麽局長科長那全部是我的明友了。於是更有事没事，化點錢，大張筵席，新聞記者們全都請了來。如此而後，聲譽寢隆，這兒有缺要我去，那兒也説非請我帮忙莫辦，倒反而感到不敷應付了。</p>
<p>個中的細未，也不用多説，葛先生就此止住了嘴。</p>
<h3>馬可尼去子</h3>
<p>— 里月</p>
<p>前幾天，發明無線電的鼻祖馬可尼到上海來了，上海人對於這位發明這二十世紀的新玩意的意大利人，也和歡迎其他外國人一樣的，盛大地熱閙了一番　除形式上的歡迎和　會以　　　無　電的雜誌，附　　不的面　地爲　個意大利的老頭兒出了好些專號，各大報也做了評論來讚揚他：大家都一致地稱他是（人類幸福的功臣）。</p>
<p>人類幸福的功臣！眞的，據説這位對於人類文化有這樣大的貢獻的科學家，稱他是（人類幸福的功臣），他當之是無愧的。　　然而，可惜得很！這個所謂（貢獻文化）的新教育利器，它對於在生活的鐵鞭底下掙扎求生的勞苦的衆人們，是發生了很微小的關係，是受了它很少的恩惠：不特此也，而且勞苦衆人們對這一新利器的印像和答覆倒乾脆的是厭煩和詛咒！我們看吧，絞着腦汁的朋友輩，或是滴着血汗的兄弟們，當他們在夜間，那怕是一個深夜，伏在停子間裏振筆製造他明天的飯糧的時候，或是日裏做完了沉重的牛馬工作，躱在（閣樓）上找尋安靜休息的時候，間壁的或是附近的，這（貢獻文化）的新教育利器，也就在這個（貢獻文化）的新教育利器，也就在這個時候，便開始活躍了起來。先是悠然地彈着弦子，漸漸地響亮了，終於成了發狂般的呌囂：煩躁的音樂，凄愴的哭號，以及彈詞，説書，吟經……的聲響，遍振着這靜底深夜的空氣，深擊着停子間或是閣樓裏主人的心，他們浸沉在這煩躁呌囂刺耳聲浪的圈圍裏，硯池裏的墨乾了，一個字寫不出！輾轉反側地把骨頭翻疼了，還是没得一會兒安靜的休息！於是他們對它就覺得不可耐的厭煩和開始無情的咒詛了。　　這還能拿什麽來掩飾呢？這一（貢獻文化）的新利器，已成爲有閒的人們一種私有的新式享樂的玩意兒了，事實上什麽還能夠掩飾得了這呢？</p>
<p>前幾天，發明這新式玩意兒的意大利的老頭兒來上海了：不多天，他又離上海了。報上載着：臨别上海的頭一日，他在應上海的要人們爲他餞行的宴會席上，他對國際無線電台購用（馬可尼公司）出品的無線電機件表示甚爲欣喜。他還説，他雖不用中國言語，但他覺得中國言語聲音頗爲悦耳……。他説這話，我疑他可曾在馬路上溜躂過，或是曾在糖炒栗子攤旁水菓店門口兜留過幾分鐘？假若他曾經歷過，他更該是怎樣（欣喜），要笑得這老，兒老花眼睛瞇得睜不開來，乾的　巴合不攏去呢！</p>
<h3>一個患肺病的朋友</h3>
<p>— 零零</p>
<p>最近有一個朋友，因爲鄉下没有好醫生，特地到上海來醫肺病。我同他有五六年不見了，久别重逢，自有一番説不出的快樂。幾年來兩人都瘦了幾許，他尤共瘦得利害，兩人相見幾不相識。回想五六年來的爲衣食而東西奔走，又　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　天，我陪他到ＸＸ醫院。</p>
<p>醫生説，要照過Ｘ光鏡，才能確定肺病的程度。</p>
<p>又明天，我們去等回音。醫生説：（要住院。）我朋友問他：（住院要多少時間？）醫生説：（一年。）</p>
<p>朋友不禁愕然了。因爲照他的預計，至多住幾個禮拜就可以出去的，肺病究竟深到怎樣程度，他至今還是茫然。</p>
<p>我就問醫生：（那末害人的肺病究竟壞到了怎樣的程度了呢？）醫生説：（這不能説。總之，照目前病狀是非住院一年不可。病的程度究竟到怎樣，你們自己去想罷。）可是他一邊又低低向我説道（這時我朋友適走出門外）（病是已很深了，（你看，）他一邊用手指着拿在手裏的那張Ｘ光照片對我道：（這左肺已經全部損壞了，右肺也壞了一點，然而尚無妨，現在所能希望的，就只有這右肺了。）</p>
<p>我爲駭然。</p>
<p>（那末。）我説，（Ｃ君你一定住院罷。）</p>
<p>（可是，我鄉下還有許多事未了，）他慢吞吞地説，（這須得讓我回去一趟料理料理再來……再則，錢的方面，也還有問題。）</p>
<p>醫生説是最好今天即刻住院，若多耽閣時間，病情不免要有變化，原照片就不能再作怎樣入手醫治的標凖了。</p>
<p>Ｃ君究竟委决不下。最後還是説，（待我明天回去，第三天再來。）醫生説（出好，但是我希望你早點來。）</p>
<p>Ｃ君是回去了。</p>
<p>三天，四天，五天，Ｃ君還不來。究竟爲什麽緣故呢？錢的問題罷？不，Ｃ君説，至少一二百元可以先凑到；事件不能一時料理清楚罷？也不至於……</p>
<p>第八天另外一個朋友的信來了。他説：Ｃ君本擬第四天就要來上海的，可是因爲他父親的反對，所以現在還未成行。他父親反對的理由，一是不捨得錢，二是西醫靠不住。因此，Ｃ君還老是等在鄉下。）最後附一筆説，（照我看，恐怕Ｃ君不會再來上海就醫的了。）</p>
<p>事情就是這樣的了。爲錢，丢性命不要緊。這還有什麽説呢？　　我終而不覺爲之悽然！</p>

<h3>呌火燭</h3>
<p>— 曲辰</p>
<p>（臘冬臘底……火燭小心……里門關關………………里門撑撑……）</p>
<p>（拆……拆……拆……）</p>
<p>在沉靜的夜裏，一種蒼老而沉重的聲音　　堂裏傳來，恍然悟到時間已過了立冬。</p>
<p>因着這聲音，更引起人思鄉的情緒來。</p>
<p>在鄉村裏是不無可戀的聲音的。如春的鳥，夏的蛙，秋的虫，冬夜的鷄鳴與犬吠，在在富有詩情畫意，想起了便會令人神往的。擊柝也是其中的一種。</p>
<p>每當夜闌人靜，微風不動的時候，遠遠地匀匀地一下又一下的柝聲和鑼聲，從無邊的空氣裏散佈開去，散佈開去，一直到你的枕上，使你像置身在一個雄壯而又古老的堡壘裏一樣，能不爲這靜靜的，而帶有一點凄凉意味的美所感動而起遐想的，怕是很少吧。</p>
<p>倘在異鄉呢，那更是引導你夢魂重返故園的絶好的媒介。試翻開歷代的詩集一檢，（刁斗）呵，（更鼓）呵，（漏聲）呵，這一，種破竹的聲音，不知打動了多少詩人的心！</p>
<p>擊柝的本意，或者不是如此。但我們没有官守，也没有貨財，不用背那（重門擊柝，以待暴客）一類的話，即使有暴客，也是自己筆頭上招來的，而非（重門擊柝）所可警戒的。我們只是一個鑒賞者。貝多芬的交響樂，固然是悦耳，但在一個詩人的感覺中，單純的擊柝聲，也不見得在名環世界的（月光曲）之下。聲音這樣東西，竟是這樣奇妙的。</p>
<p>年來飄流在外，雖間亦一返，亦已好久不聽到故鄉的擊柝聲了。今夜聽到了，就恍如回到了故鄉一般。感謝那擊柝者，每家每夜殷勤的指引。</p>

<h3>上海（十八）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>廿九月夜</p>
<p>我一切都已明白過來的心房，又被打擾得零亂無主了。前腦還是隠隠作痛，竭力想思索敏姊和慧姊相見時的情形，一切可以比擬的都湧上心來。慧姊拒絶了我的剖白而接受敏姊的解釋，她們之間的談話，對於我不知是怎樣的認識？敏姊雖然受不住叔父的壓迫，却注意着我的行動同時逃到上海來，不必强辯，她的意志是這樣的明顯。昨天對慧姊的解釋，也是種虚心的表現。慧姊是我小時候的伴侶，我們的（愛）是由兒童時代滋長起來的，不過外祖母心目中的生成的鄉下孩子，在最近幾年來距離我太遠了。我不滿意我的舅父是事實，像舅父不滿意我是事實一樣。我不滿意慧姊的都市習氣太深也是事實，那天和敏姊從法國公園回來，我曾寫了長長的一封信，告訴她我雖生在二十世紀的青年，我的頭腦還是那樣腐化，我這次的脱離家庭，想深入社會去嘗試一點痛苦，我永遠不會跟時代跑，現在我們集合了一羣儍子，幹着聰明人認爲最儍的事。寄出後自悔太生硬的措辭，刺痛我小時候伴侶底慧姊的心是那樣的不應該，但是因爲忙着社中的事務，自悔儘歸自悔，寄出的信無可挽回的忘去了。昨天慧姊突然的到社中來，我已預料到事情的不尋常，我見了她絶然換了個人的裝束，我對於我的自悔更深了，慧姊已從她的惡劣環境中反變過來，她已接受了我信中的勸告；但是她聽見了小黄無意的（三角戀愛）。女子的心地是那樣的狹窄，她絶然而去，今天并拒絶了我的剖白。不過昨天閉門哭過來的敏姊，却能跑到徐家匯去解釋明白…我望着斑駁的天花板，整個的腦海中盤旋着這些問題，一切都已明白過來的心，像一盤散沙般的紛亂。</p>
<p>背上的衣服被汗質凝住着被褥，自己按手額角，似乎已清凉了，喉間不過還是乾燥，免强撑起身來，支着不穏的身體到桌子邊，提起熱水環却是空的；於是趿着拖鞋搬到窗口，天是清朗的，月光從玻璃窗中透進來那樣地的可愛，我不見這般可愛的月光，在黑暗中討生活，不知已幾許時候了。忘了自己的病，拖了雜辭的思潮，推開窗去，領略這月色給與我的光明。坐着，坐着，在一切像死去的的寂寞中我不知自己的存在了。朦朧聽見噪雜的小烏啁啾聲，快近天明的時候，我摸摸四肢，都已冰冷，同時心中也平止了，盍上窗，跋回床邊，自己笑瓶着，一夜没有好睡，却顧慮着這些事呢！</p>

<h3>瑙瑪希拉的戀愛史（中）</h3>
<p>— 思</p>
<p>（二）和愛爾温泰爾堡的初次見面</p>
<p>瑙瑪闔了日記本，不覺地歎了一口氣。她忽然想起了一個人，愛爾温泰爾堡。他遠遠地在好萊塢，居然在什麽地方看見了她的影子而引起了他的注意，并且還呌東方辦事處來尋她。（我應就謝謝他），她想着。她就馬上寫了一封極簡單的信寄給他了。可是從此以後，她天天忙着在這裏在那裏作模特兒，在這個在那個影片公司裏作着臨時演員，泰爾堡的名字漸漸淡了，終至由淺而消滅了。這樣過了幾個禮拜，忽然有一封信，從老遠的好萊塢，遞到紐約一個坎拿大女子的手裏。那是從好萊塢一個新組織的公司，呌路易斯梅爾公司（LouisB.Mayer）寄來的。信裏寫着可以給她六個月的工作，一切到好萊塢路上的費用，歸公司担負。　　瑙瑪看着信紙上印的路易斯梅爾公司幾個字，她雖不認識那個公司是誰開的，但覺得很情願去試試。當時她並不知道泰爾堡就是那新公司的總經理。在一天的早晨，瑙瑪希拉和她的母親，已經從寒冱的東方的紐約，來到枉方温暖的加利福尼亞。她們下了車，亦没有人來接她們。這個嬌小的女子，穿了新製的藍衣服，她一隻手緊緊地拿着小皮包，合同亦在裏面，一隻手攬着她母親，走出了車站，跳上了一輛街車，就風馳電掣地將她們送到好萊塢去了。</p>
<p>她到了好萊塢的第二天早晨，就興怱怱地跑到喀爾佛城的大影片公司裏。問訊處的女職員告訴她，她應當去見總經理泰爾堡先生。她離開了問訊處在過道裏遇見了一個青年。那個青年問她道：（我可以帮你的忙嗎）？她羞答答地道：（是的。我的名字呌瑙瑪希籣，昨天剛到的。他們呌我去見總經理泰爾堡先生。可以請你告訴我他在那裏嗎）？那少年聽見了，覺得很有趣。他説：（好的，希拉小姐，請你跟我來），她就跟了他去到一間很大很大的大屋子裏，當中放着一張玻璃面的大寫字檯。他們到了那裏，那少年拉着一張椅子給瑙瑪道：（請坐一坐）。</p>
<p>她坐了下來，心裏想着：（唔，這倒是個很解人意的</p>
<p>OffceBoy，或者他是個Clerk。不管他是什麽，倒是很知趣的人）。她想到這裏，忽然大聲地問那少年道：（我不知道那個泰爾堡是個怎樣的人。請你告訴我好不好？我想他一定是個惟我獨尊的人。或者他有一個又大又紅的臉，一個長而帶鈎的鼻子，嘴裏咬了一支又粗又大雪茄。是不是）？那少年笑着道：（唔，你説的不大對。泰爾堡或者有的地方像你所想象的，但是無論怎樣，他嘴裏並没有又粗又大的雪茄。我怎樣知道的呢？因爲－你看－我的名字是泰爾堡，愛爾温泰爾堡呀）！</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉聽見了，一交跌在地板上，小皮包亦隨之而滾在地上了。泰爾堡這時還是笑着，他慢慢走到大寫字檯的後面坐下了。他説：（希拉小姐，我們談正經事吧，不是我們已經正式介紹過了嗎）？瑙瑪從地板上爬了起來，拾着皮包，漸漸恢復原狀，於是大家都笑了起來，一個坐在椅子裏，一個坐在寫字檯的後面。他們笑得很暢快，因爲他們兩個都是富於幽默心思的。他們從那個時候起，已經都心心相印了。（未完）</p>

<h3>評（魔俠吉訶德）Don　Quixcte</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>－南京映－</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>雖然題目的第一個字是（評），但在這裏我祇想寫一些關於故事方面的話，對讀者們聊盡解釋和介紹的責任。關於其他的一切，只好讓友好的專家作更精細的介紹。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>堂，吉訶德（Don　Quixote）是一部小説的書名，也就是小説中主人翁的名字。這一部小説産生於十七世紀開始時的西班牙，直到現在爲止，可以説是風行世界。以前，有人將它編爲舞台劇本，現在又由小説搬上銀幕了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>在十六世紀的法國，騎士小説受到非常的歡迎，同樣在十七世紀初葉的西班牙，騎士小説亦漸漸得着人們感激的愛讀了。</p>
<p>在這時候，西班牙的小貴族階級，隨着封建制度之没落而没落，同時都市中的資本主義文化的漸次發達，亦是使其没落的原因。以後便轉化於雜階級的知識階級之中去了。這種現象在文學上表現出來的時候，一方面極力打擊那趨於死滅的騎士階級，及其文化，理想，詩歌等，另一方面，却以最後的光芒來圍照那已成（過去之陰影）的騎士的姿態。（弗理契的（歐洲文學發達史））於是（堂，吉訶德）便於此時應運而生。</p>
<p>我們知道，這部小説的作者塞萬提斯（Migtol　de　Cervantes　1547-616）,是與莎斯比亞同時代的人，他生平最愛讀關於武士冒險一類的書。他是一個堅苦卓絶的人，不甘受人壓服的反抗者。當他將近五十歲的時候，向貴族收税，貴族恃强不納，反把他監禁在牢獄之中。而這一部四十餘萬字的大書，便是他在窮困的鐵窗生活中寫成的。於一六○五年第一次出版。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>關於他的生平，我不想在這裏詳細介紹，不過我得説明，這一部小説完全是他自身的生活和思想的反映。</p>
<p>塞萬提斯的小説，無論在小説的形式，主人公的素描，或是意識形態上説來，都是對騎士階級的（戲擬）。主人公愛讀騎士的小説，决意想在現出古代騎士們的偉業。於是他爲自己幻想了一個美麗的夫人，找着一個徒弟，跨上馬背去探求冒險事業了。但是他的一切偉業，和他自身一樣，完全是一種漫畫。他把風磨當做巨人，以羊羣當做軍隊，以旅店當做城堡。然而一切都没有好的結果。一切都不像理想中的那般有利益，相反的，都是一些現實的惡害。例如他解救在主人殘酷鞭撻之下的牧羊兒，反而使牧羊兒多受一頓惡打，（電影上没有的）。他解放了一羣被押解到兵船上去划船的奴隸，反而被奴隸們以石塊抛擲。……結果，俗人們都從這位危險而固執的保護者的脅下逃跑，更向天祈禱，希望將他和其他的騎士同時處死。這和浮士德的拯救世人，反給人們火焚以死一樣，這恩惠者的騎士的悲哀，永遠榮繞在我們的心頭。</p>
<p>作者給了吉訶德先生一種滑稽的性質，同時又將他做成一個理想主義者。作者一方面理解騎士的風習和理想之死滅，但在情感上却袒護着這一最後的負担者。此所謂愛中的嘲笑或從嘲笑中所窺見的愛，也就是含涙的知或含笑的涙了。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>總之，塞萬提斯一方面以嘲笑來埋葬騎士的世界和騎士的文學，但同時亦程步高編劇兼導演之新片（同仇）。王瑩與謝雲卿。用着詩的光耀的圓光，來圍照自己的（悲哀姿態的騎亡）。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>我們是如此理解作者，是如此分析（堂，吉訶德），那末現在我們再來檢討這電影上的主人公罷。</p>
<p>當然，在潑柏斯脱的創造力之下，他是不會改變小説之原形的。自然不能將全部小説搬上銀幕，而祗能摘要的有機的聨繫。有的地方，他是誇張了書中的某一部份，同時也捨棄了某些部份。前後的次序顚倒，幾回事變作一回事。——因爲電影有其戲劇上的特殊性，改換曲部的形態自有必要。假使照原書一樣，不顧及電影的戲劇性，自然最愚笨不過的事，何貴乎改編。譬如説攻打風磨，在小説的前部，而電影上却作爲最後的高潮。吉訶德是被騙回去的，燒書也是以前的事，而電影上却是他眼望着燒書而死，這在電影上是何等巧妙成功啊！當我們看到被燒的小説成了一本（堂，吉訶德），以説明他精神之永在。</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>總之，我希望觀衆們不要把他當作一　　　　　　　　　　　　　　主人公的悲哀之。</p>
<h3>評（熱河血涙史）</h3>
<p>— 綠意</p>
<p>在這民氣漸漸銷沉的現在，以熱河義軍抗日作爲題材的（熱河血涙史）的放映，倒未始不是一服興奮劑。如果能有計劃地把當時的實情活生生地搬上銀幕，當能使觀衆對於熱河的失守更進一步的理解。而另一方面也可以保留了一部分史實。但是，（熱河血涙史）告訴我們的是什麽呢？它祗刻板地介紹了幾個所謂民族英雄的音容笑貌；它祇零星地介紹了幾隊軍隊的行動；它祗在字幕上作了大聲疾呼的抗日。這不是故事，因爲故事是應該前後連貫地發展的；這更不是史實，因爲史實是應該將戰事的暴發與失敗的原因顯示出來的。</p>
<p>這一影片除了題目上的（史）字不能符合内容外，其他（血）和（涙）這兩個字也是誇大的，如果照熱河義軍抗日的實情講起來，確是血涙交流的，但這片畫面上顯出來的情調却並不符合（血涙）這兩個字眼的含義，義軍的艱難困苦的戰地生活，介紹得十分不夠。</p>
<p>然而，話又得這樣説：影片本身雖然使我們感到失望，而慧冲公司攝製這一影片的動機和精神却是值得我們欽佩的。</p>
<h3>不要忽略了眉毛</h3>
<p>— 嚴祖忻</p>
<p>中國電影女星，在扮演村姑貧婦的時候，對於眉毛的化裝太忽略了。譬如在（小玩意）裏的（葉大嫂）（阮玲玉飾）當她家破女亡，躅躑街頭，販賣玩意兒的時候，雖然身上穿了破衣服，肩上披了麻布袋，面部十足表演出顚沛流離的困苦，然而二道眉毛，却仍是畫得細如柳葉，這豈不是出乎情理之外嗎？所以我希望以後我們的女星，在化裝時，對是眉毛也要注意一些，務使與劇中人的身份相埒，不要以爲這是小地方而忽略啦！（却酬）</p>
<h3>聨華同人聨歡會　决定本月十七日舉行</h3>
<p>聨華影業公司同仁，原定於本月六日在聨華第一廠内舉行聨歡大會，消息早見各報。惟延至昨日，尚未見有動靜。經向該會負責方面探問，據稱日來因廠方工作頗形緊張，而聨歡會本身游藝方面亦需要充實準備，兼以會址原定聨華一廠，深恐臨時列席人多，場地不敷，有礙秩序，故暫從緩舉行。茲據該會會商結果，擬改借康腦脱路聨華第二製片廠爲大會會塲，俾得從容佈置，以盡賓至如歸之樂。會期已確定爲本月十七日下午二時至六時，使各項游藝充分排練純熟，種種措施無非欲使大會格外生色也。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 素因</p>
<p>馬區先生開始説話了。他説：（醫生説我可以回家休息，但是要没有約翰勃羅克的話，我那能回家呢。約翰説，上那兒去了一？於是大家回過頭來，才發現約翰和勞萊已經走了。馬區先生繼續着説道：（就是親生的兒子，亦不見得更孝順了。但是我不願意講話，我願意看看你們的臉，我日思夜想的親愛的人一。於是大家緊緊地挨着他。亞梅坐在他脚底下，一邊是美格和奇奥，一邊是媽嬭，蓓絲的頭靠在她父親的肩膀上。這就是幾個月以來，夢想所不到的，最甜蜜的聚會了。</p>
<p>在這個當兒，奇奥的眼睛忽然看着美格的臉，心裏暗暗地恨她：這樣快活的家庭，她能立意破壞，去嫁給那個約翰勃羅克嗎？後來美格一個人在客廳裏，好像在等候一個客人似的。奇奥就走到她面前，求告她道：（美格，你爲什麽要走呢？爲什麽不能常住在一起而要去嫁人呢）？美格道：（誰説的？我不要嫁人呀。要是你説勃羅克的話，他亦没有向我求過婚。要是他向我求婚的話，我可以告訴他太早好了）。奇奥歡喜得將她的姊姊抱着説道：（那是再好没有的了。現在父親亦回來了，我們不是再快活没有了麽一？門鈴響了。奇奥連忙放開了手，向樓上走去，臨上樓又叮囑了她姊姊，不要忘記了剛才説的話。　　美格去開了門，勃羅克進來了。他們談了一回，勃羅克果然開始向美格求婚了。他拉着她的手。可是她縮開了。她羞答答地將剛才擬好的一段話，拉拉雜雜地背了一篇，可是勃羅克道：（我可以等候的。我可以不管工作得都辛苦，等待得都長久，我祇要有一個希望，就是到了最後的將來，會得到一個報酬。你能不給我一線的希望嗎）。他無恨深情地求着。美格低聲地道：（那是我恐怕不能）。痛苦使他的眼睛黑了。他緊緊的問着：（眞的嗎？那是你的意思嗎）？</p>
<p>美格還没有能回答他，門開了，姑母來了。勃羅克看見了那可怕的老太婆，亦就悄然引退了。姑母拿鋭利的目光，對着美格道：（那勞倫斯家教書的來做什麽）？美格連忙禁止她道：（噓…别給他聽見了，他是父親的恩人哩）！（什麽？你父親的恩人？他要是不來糾纏你，才是你父親的恩人哩。我是替你設想。你應當嫁給一個有錢的人。那個勃羅克是個窮光蛋，在社會上没有地位的人）！美格反抗起來了。她説：（這亦不見得他一輩子没有錢，一輩子没有地位呀）。那老太婆憤恨極了，她説：（哦，他原來是在想我的錢呢。好，我告訴你，小姐…）美格怒極了她高聲道：（姑母，你不用講那種話！我的約翰决不是爲財而娶的人。我們亦不要你的錢。我們可以工作。我們不怕窮……）她不説下去了，因爲她忽然想起了她剛才和約翰所講的話。可是她的姑母還是滔滔不絶的道：（小姐，你聽着，你要是嫁給這霍克，羅克，或克羅克的話，不要想得到我一個錢）！（未完）</p>

<h3>Zhang Ji and His Entourage Arrive in Guangdong; Meet with Chen, Xiao, et al.; Political Council Holds Banquet in Their Honor; Detailed Discussions of the Current Situation Held During the Meal; Zhang et al. Plan to Visit Nanning Within Days</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi arrived in the provincial capital at 6:30 AM on the 13th. They first went to Huanghuagang to pay respects to the seventy-two martyrs, then to Meihua Village to meet with Chen Jitang, Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, Deng Zeru, and other committee members. At noon, the Political Council, in the name of the Standing Committee, hosted a banquet for Zhang and his party. They discussed the current situation in detail until 2 PM. While at Haihua Village, Zhang told reporters that he was representing the Central Government to discuss with various committees in the South how to unite, and did not come with any particular method or condition. It is certainly their wish that the various committees go to Beijing to jointly manage the central authorities, but this is a secondary issue. Hu Hanmin has not expressed any opinion regarding going to Beijing, but Hu loves the party and the country extremely, and there is no difference whether he is in Hong Kong or Beijing. The Central Government is determined to quickly eliminate the Fujian rebel party who changed the era name. In addition to sending us brothers to Guangdong, the Central Government will continue to send Sun Ke and Dai Jitao south. We brothers are scheduled to go to Nanning on the 15th with Zhang Renmin and Mai Huanzhang to meet with Li Bai. Chen Zhaoying came to Guangdong not only with political tasks, but also under Chiang's orders to discuss military matters with Chen Jitang. (13th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Central representatives Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Wang Luyi, and Chen Zhaoying, along with Liu Luzhen, Lin Yizhong, Liu Jiwen, and others, arrived in the provincial capital at 6:40 AM this morning on the British ship "Longshan" from Hong Kong last night at 9 PM. The authorities received a telegram from Hong Kong in advance and sent military police to protect them at the pier. Qiu Jinxian, secretary of the Political Committee, and Zeng Qiang, director of the deputy officer's office of the headquarters, gathered at the pier at 6 AM to welcome them. Amidst the joyful music, Zhang and his party rode in cars prepared by the Political Committee and drove directly to the Tuisiyuan residence. At 10 AM, they went to the Political Committee to meet with various committee members, and Xiao Focheng and Zou Lu received them in the flower hall on the second floor. They then went to the First Army Group headquarters to visit Chen Jitang. They returned to Tuisiyuan to rest at 11:30 AM. A large detachment of police from the Public Security Bureau was stationed at Tuisiyuan to provide strict protection. Two adjutants from the headquarters were assigned to take care of them. Many relatives and friends of Zhang and his party came to visit, and the carriages in front of the gate were endless, not unlike the grand occasion of the extraordinary conference of the Fourth Plenary Session in the winter of the 19th year. The Executive Department and the Political Committee jointly hosted a banquet at 6 PM this evening in the flower hall of the Political Committee to welcome the four representatives, inviting various committee members to accompany them. Chen Jitang is scheduled to host a banquet at his private residence in Meihua Village tonight to welcome them. Tomorrow morning at 9 AM, the Executive Department and the Political Committee will hold a joint meeting, inviting the four representatives to attend. The notice has been issued this afternoon. The Political Committee has again telegraphed Standing Committee member Tang Shaoyi to come to the province to discuss the current situation. (13th, Far Eastern News Agency Dispatch) (Guangzhou) The four peace representatives from Nanjing arrived in the province this morning by ship from Hong Kong. Many government officials greeted them at the wharf. The four representatives will immediately hold a meeting with the provincial authorities. If necessary, they may fly to Guangxi to meet with Li Bai. The four representatives plan to stay in the province for several days. Given the sincerity with which the people of Guangdong welcome the four representatives, the hope for peace seems good. (13th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Dai Jitao Will Follow</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) A Reuters reporter interviewed Zhang Ji today, who said that Sun Ke and Dai Jitao will both come here soon to confer with the leaders of the Southwest on the political situation. At present, his and the other three representatives' arrival here is only a prelude. They will make a trip to Guangxi in two or three days, and then rush back to the new capital to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. When the reporter inquired about Hu Hanmin's attitude, Zhang said that Hu's criticism of the mistakes of several party members was quite justified, because Hu is willing to protect both the party and the country. As for whether Hu will go to Beijing, that is another matter. Zhang talked about the Fujian Incident, saying that the rebel party's abandonment of the national flag and destruction of the Premier's will and portrait have forfeited their qualifications as citizens, so a political solution is out of the question. Zhang denied that the Fourth Plenary Session on the 20th of this month was convened to discuss a plan to resolve the Fujian Incident. Zhang also refused to explain the Southwest's attitude towards the Central Government, only saying that he did not know whether any members of the Central Committee from Guangdong Province would go to Beijing to participate in the meeting. Zhang later refuted the claim that the Central Government was not resisting foreign aggression, saying that the diplomatic policy set by the Central Government after the September 18th Incident has not changed. The Central Government's resistance to Japan can be evidenced by the battles of Shanghai, Gubeikou, and Jiumentou. It should be understood that effective resistance is a matter of strength. China's military equipment is inferior, so it is difficult to expect to fight a long-term battle with an invading country with strong military equipment. (13th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>=Zhang and Others Pay Respects to the Huanghuagang Martyrs=</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) After Zhang Ji and other four representatives paid their respects at the tomb of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, they visited Chen Jitang at his private residence and talked for over an hour. They then discussed with various officials of the Southwest Political Affairs Council. However, it is said that no resolutions were made. The Southwest Executive Committee hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the representatives. The representatives will visit Li Bai in Guangxi within two days. The future of the overall situation is difficult to predict. (13th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>=Guangzhou's Atmosphere Suddenly Turns Optimistic=</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) After the Nanjing peace representatives arrived here, the atmosphere suddenly turned optimistic. The Southwest Political Affairs Council hosted a banquet this afternoon to welcome the representatives, after which the representatives held a discussion with the leaders of Guangdong Province. An official spokesman announced that several members of the Central Committee from Guangdong Province may attend the Fourth Plenary Session in Beijing. Whether the mission of the peace representatives' trip to the South can succeed depends entirely on the attitude of Guangxi Province, because Guangxi has a pivotal influence on the Fujian situation. The Nanjing representatives told Reuters reporters that they have decided to make a trip to Guangxi and are confident that any difficulties can be overcome. The peace representatives are scheduled to meet with reporters this afternoon and may issue a statement. (13th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>=Hu Hanmin to Issue a Declaration=</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Zou Lu said that Mr. Zhang Puquan and others were ordered to come south to invite Central Committee members staying in Guangdong to attend the Fourth Plenary Session in Beijing. He believes that the meeting emphasizes the spirit, not the form, so whether to attend or not is not important. As for how to develop the current situation, we should seek its crux. The attitude of the Southwest authorities is detailed in the telegram. He has not had in-depth discussions with Mr. Zhang and others, and has no other opinions to express at this time. He is not very clear about the results of the talks between Mr. Zhang and others in Hong Kong with Mr. Hu (Hanmin), but as far as he knows, Mr. Hu's whereabouts depend on whether his propositions can be thoroughly implemented, otherwise he will never go to Beijing. Liu Luzhen said that Mr. Hu will issue an important declaration on the current situation in the coming days. He will not attend the Fourth Plenary Session, nor will he have any proposals.

<h3>=Li Bai Will Not Cooperate with Fujian=</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Xiaojun, a senator of the Military Advisory Council, said that the Guangxi provincial authorities are actively engaged in construction work. After the Fujian Incident, it was rumored that Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi had connections with them. As far as he knows, Li Bai and Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen have a considerable personal relationship. However, this time, Chen and Li's destruction of the party and rebellion against the country is unacceptable to Li Bai, so there is no possibility of cooperation. Whether Li Bai will come to Beijing to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session depends on the results of Mr. Zhang Puquan and other four gentlemen's negotiations in Guangdong. If all the Central Committee members staying in Guangdong can come to Beijing at that time, then Li Bai will also come to Beijing together. (13th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Match Industry Petitions for Cancellation of Tax Increase; Yu Xuezhong Promises to Forward to Central Government</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the implementation of the increased tax on cigarettes, matches, cement, and other items, the cigarette industry in this city had united to oppose it. However, because the Shanghai cigarette factory succumbed, it also knew it was difficult and retreated, but the request to revise the tax scale is still in progress. As for the match industry, the six companies, including Beiyang, Danhua, and Rongchang Sanyou, due to the dumping of foreign goods at depreciated prices, caused the domestic goods to be taxed more and there are no buyers in Tianjin. The six factories have a total of more than 10,000 workers. Although they are working as usual now, they have not shipped any goods since the 5th, and have accumulated more than 20,000 boxes. If they continue to work for a month, they will inevitably exhaust their funds, and the inventory cannot be sold. They will inevitably go bankrupt. This is oppressed by heavy taxes, and is not what the factories are willing to do. At that time, more than 10,000 workers will lose their jobs, which is not a blessing for society. The managers of the six companies, Bai Heyi and others, took a petition to the provincial government at 3 PM on the 13th to cancel the tax increase. Yu Xuezhong received them, and briefly said that business difficulties should be sympathized with, and government laws and regulations should also be obeyed. Within the possible range, assistance will be given, and the central government will be requested to review and handle the case. The representatives are scheduled to petition the municipal government, the municipal party headquarters, and the Social Affairs Bureau on the 14th. (13th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary: Prospects for the Central Representatives' Trip to Guangdong</h3>
<p>The trip of the four central representatives, Zhang Ji and others, to Guangdong and their meeting with Chen, Hu, and others is of great importance. If this meeting can reach a satisfactory conclusion, not only can the past grievances between the central government and the Southwest be dispelled, but the Fujian incident can also be somewhat mitigated. If the result is unfortunately unfavorable and the opinions cannot be reconciled, then no one can predict the origins and course of future disputes. Therefore, this trip of the four representatives to Guangdong, not only does the central government hope to achieve the goal of spiritual unity, but also our general people who only seek peaceful lives are sincerely praying for its success.</p>
<p>As for how to achieve the effect of spiritual unity, the central representatives had a sincere expression when they arrived in Hong Kong on the ship. They said: "[The leaders] all followed the Premier for many years, sharing hardships and slander. At this time, we must endure the pain of thinking and seek a way out for the country and the nation. We must endure all intolerable hardships and accept all necessary accusations. The so-called 'adversity builds a nation' may not be at this moment." Reading this, we deeply feel the pain of their words, and recalling the past, we are filled with endless sadness. The country has not been ruined to this point, and the central leaders have not been estranged to this point, all because they could not endure these intolerable hardships and could not accept these necessary accusations. Today, the leaders in any aspect, please ask themselves, can they deny the words of the representatives going to Guangdong? The national crisis is so serious that the responsibilities borne by the authorities are of course very difficult. Only if those responsible can put aside their private opinions and work together in harmony can they hope to barely overcome it. However, leaders in times of difficulty may not fully recognize the importance of the responsibilities they bear, disregard praise or blame, and ignore personal interests, and resolutely take on the burden with one shoulder. Moreover, the views on dealing with this difficult political situation cannot be entirely the same. One's own views may not be right, but one is unwilling to sacrifice them. Other's views may not be wrong, but one disdains to accept them. With these two thoughts of shirking responsibility and self-confidence, they are bound to clash with each other. As time goes on, the phenomenon of estrangement arises. This is what is meant by "enduring all intolerable hardships."</p>
<p>Since ancient times, those who assume great responsibilities cannot avoid being accused. Even the sages of ancient times or those who have made great contributions to the country still cannot avoid the criticism of the world and future generations. Where in the world is there someone who is beyond reproach? Moreover, criticism and accusation are precisely enough to serve as warnings and correct personal mistakes. Therefore, the more open and honest a person is, the less they avoid people's criticism and accusation, and may even welcome people's criticism and accusation. If, because of people's criticism and accusation, one must vehemently defend oneself or prevent them from fully expressing their opinions, then this estrangement will often accumulate in the middle and there will be no way to express both parties' opinions, and even less will there be any way to understand each other. For those in government, the key is to dredge and not to block. Therefore, we hope that both sides will focus on mutual communication. If people occasionally accuse without understanding, they will surely be able to prove it with facts in the future, and the ice will melt away. This is what is meant by "accepting all necessary accusations."</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to hope for the success of the Southwest mediation today, the leaders must thoroughly realize and sincerely implement the two phrases of the central peace envoy. They must first be able to meet each other frankly and honestly, with the country and the nation as the premise, with no interest that cannot be sacrificed, no words that cannot be made public, and no grievances that cannot be dispelled. Only then can we speak of unity. If we can do this, then no matter how divergent the opinions or how conflicting the conditions, is there anything that cannot be discussed? Moreover, is it only the Southwest issue that cannot be discussed? We are looking forward to its success with great anticipation.</p>

<h3>Avenol's Three Key Points in Speech: League of Nations Should Maintain Global Universality; Rights of All Nations Must Be Equally Guaranteed; Application of Covenant Can Coexist with Traditional Diplomacy; Overthrowing Old Institutions Would Add New Factors of Disturbance.</h3>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol delivered a speech in London yesterday regarding the organization of the League of Nations in Geneva, highlighting three key points of particular interest to countries in the Far East: (1) Avenol advocated that the League of Nations must maintain its universal, worldwide character. He did not wish to elaborate on this point in London because he was speaking to the British people, who, with their vast self-governing territories throughout the world, clearly understand the need for the League of Nations to be universal. If the League of Nations cannot continue to include countries from all major continents, it will inevitably fail beyond redemption. (2) Avenol explained the concept of equality among nations within the League of Nations, stating that although the word "equality" is not explicitly mentioned in the League Covenant, the articles clearly stipulate that the rights of all nations, whether large or small, are equally guaranteed. The Covenant also stipulates that matters concerning the interests of all nations must be unanimously approved to be effective. This is how the equality of all nations is secured, ensuring that the vital interests of each nation are not sacrificed under any circumstances, and that the sovereignty of each nation is on an equal footing with that of the largest nations. (3) Avenol believes that the detailed rules for applying the League Covenant can be revised at any time. International cooperation and Geneva diplomacy can coexist with traditional diplomacy. The territorial dispute over the Gran Chaco region between Bolivia and Paraguay, for example, was both addressed by the League of Nations and mediated by neighboring countries, resulting in a positive outcome. This shows that neither the Pan-American Union nor the European Union advocated by Briand conflict with Geneva's policies; both can complement each other and achieve mutual benefits. As for non-member states of the League of Nations, such as the Soviet Union in the Far East and the United States in Latin America or Europe, they are undeniably equally important factors for peace. In short, if reforms to the League of Nations are necessary, they can be made within the scope of the Covenant; there is no need to overthrow the Covenant, nor to add new factors of disturbance to the world situation, which is already in a chaotic abyss. This is what Avenol wants to repeatedly emphasize. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Franco-German Negotiations: The Key to World Peace</h3>
<p>(Paris) Georges Bernhard, the chief editor of the German-language "Paris Daily," published in Paris, commented on the issue of Franco-German talks, stating that direct talks between France and Germany actually began on November 24 when the French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, met with Hitler. Whether such talks are appropriate at this time is undeniable. If we consider the matter deeply, the so-called Franco-German problem concerns not only France or Germany, but also the peace of Europe and even the world, which depends on the resolution of this problem. Understanding this is half the battle in addressing Franco-German relations. To maintain peace, all beneficial methods should be tried. As for who initially proposed them and who ultimately succeeds, it is entirely unimportant. (13th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Assures Germany: No Intention to Adopt Encirclement Policy</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, met with German Chancellor Hitler again the day before yesterday, the "Paris Morning News" reported yesterday that Poncet assured Hitler that Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour had absolutely no intention of adopting an encirclement policy against Germany. All newspapers are commenting on this matter today. "Le Petit Parisien" reported that (whether it was the French Foreign Ministry or Germany, neither party mentioned the Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to France and Paul-Boncour's trip to Poland and Central Europe). (13th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Results of Direct Talks: Franco-German Understanding Discounted</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, met with German Chancellor Hitler yesterday, the benefits of direct Franco-German talks have been discounted. According to reliable sources, Poncet holds the view that France and Germany cannot independently resolve the Saar and disarmament issues because the Saar issue is governed by treaty provisions, and the disarmament issue is a matter that has been discussed at international conferences. Poncet intended to inquire about Hitler's views on Germany's military needs, but was unsuccessful. (13th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) A communiqué was issued after the State Council meeting, stating that the State Council had not made any decisions regarding Franco-German talks. According to the German government's views, several issues should be raised for discussion in direct talks between Paris and Berlin. However, the French government's position on these issues will only be determined after the government reconsiders them. Currently, it is still a period of gathering information. If the information that France obtains from its friendly governments regarding Germany is of a nature sufficient to create the atmosphere necessary for Franco-German talks, then formal negotiations between France and Germany can actually proceed. Therefore, informed sources do not place much importance on the meeting between the French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, and German Chancellor Hitler yesterday. It is said that during Poncet's first meeting with Hitler on November 24, Hitler presented some opinions to the French Ambassador and detailed Germany's demands regarding the Saar region and German rearmament. As for yesterday's talks between Poncet and Hitler, they were limited to an exchange of information. Poncet seemed to have requested Hitler to provide a more detailed explanation of the views he expressed during the first meeting. As for what actions the French government will take on certain matters in the future, Poncet reserved his position to Hitler. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>African Black Troops Transferred to Europe: Germany Concerned About France's Intentions</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to reports from Paris, a fierce debate has broken out in French military circles regarding the transfer of African black troops to Europe. General Weygand is in favor of transferring black troops to Europe. After inspecting French Morocco in Africa last November and returning to the country, he advocated transferring African black troops to Europe to fill the gaps in the French army. This is because the population of France decreased between 1914 and 1918, resulting in a significant shortage of troops. It is reported that the French General Staff strongly supports General Weygand's proposal and plans to transfer a total of about 5,000 black troops to Europe in 1934. However, General Lyautey strongly opposes the arrival of African troops in Europe. His reason is that after these black people come to Europe, they are very likely to spread their radical ideas. Therefore, unless it is wartime, these black people should not be transferred to Europe. General Lyautey also suggested that instead of transferring African black troops to Europe, it would be better to shorten the term of military service to two years and increase the number of reservists. Furthermore, after receiving this report, German public opinion expressed extreme panic and believed that France's deployment of African black troops to garrison the Franco-German border was the most dangerous thing and would indicate France's lack of intention to disarm and unwillingness to maintain friendly relations with Germany.

<h3>German Cruiser "Emden" Returns Home After World Tour: Hitler Personally Welcomes, Does Not Attend Parliament Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today is the opening day of the new German Parliament. The venue is located at the Kroll Opera House near the old Parliament building. Before the opening time, the public had gathered around the opera house in the hope of catching a glimpse of the Prime Minister's demeanor. However, they were disappointed because Hitler had gone to Wilhelmshaven this morning to personally welcome the German cruiser "Emden," which had returned home today after a year-long world tour. Inside the parliament hall, the walls were decorated with new national flags, and guards organized by the Stormtroopers and Steel Helmets stood on both sides. After the assembly was convened, Interior Minister Frick stood up and proposed that Göring be jointly appointed as the Speaker of the Parliament. Frick's motion was immediately passed by unanimous acclamation from the Parliament. Subsequently, three deputy speakers were elected: the former Speaker of the Prussian State Council, Kerr; the former Speaker of the Bavarian State Council, Eisel; and Siems. Later, the plenary session of the meeting passed a resolution giving Göring the power to convene the next session. Göring immediately stood up to express his gratitude. The government's policy statement will be read when Prime Minister Hitler personally attends Parliament. After Göring finished his speech, the entire hall cheered and shouted "Long live the Prime Minister and the German people" three times, and the meeting ended. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German cruiser (Emden) has returned to Wilhelmshaven after visiting various countries in the Far East, including China and Japan. Chancellor Hitler gave a speech to the crew, saying (Among the countries of the world, those who hate Germany deeply resent the revival of the German nation, so they also express resentment towards us, who represent Germany. I believe you have noticed and felt this sentiment.) He also said that Germany's sincere love of peace has already been proclaimed to the world, but we will protect our honor and the rights related to the survival of the nation at all times. This is not a provocation, but merely a request to enjoy equal rights with other nations. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Published "Who's Who": Hitler Not Selected Among 40,000 People</h3>
<p>(London) The names listed in the British "Who's Who" are all those who have a reputation at the time. Mediocre people cannot be selected. However, in the 1934 edition issued in London, the name of German Chancellor Hitler was not included among the 40,000 names, and other leaders of the National Socialist government were also excluded. However, other dictators such as Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Turkish President Kemal, the famous Polish politician Piłsudski, and even Soviet Communist Party Secretary Stalin were all included. What is the reason for this? The editors adhere to traditional customs and firmly refuse to explain. It is also noteworthy that many politicians, writers, and scientists of the German Republican government, including those who were expelled from the country by the Hitler government, are included in the list.

<h3>South Manchuria Railway Reorganization Plan: Kwantung Army and South Manchuria Railway Decide on Five Measures</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A concrete plan for the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) has been established between the Kwantung Army and the SMR authorities and has been reported to the Army Central Department by the Kwantung Army Command. After receiving the SMR's report, the Army Ministry and the Colonial Ministry invited the relevant authorities to begin deliberations for a final decision. The original draft of the SMR reorganization plan decided at the final meeting of the heads of the Kwantung Army and the SMR is as follows: (1) Separate various SMR's economic undertakings and transform them into independent companies (tentatively called the Manchurian Industrial Development Corporation). In the future, increase capital when necessary and invest in various companies. (2) The companies will not directly operate businesses. The majority of shares in the separated companies will be held to control their management. Various large and small trading companies that have already been established or are being planned will be temporarily affiliated with the holding company and reorganized at an appropriate time. (3) The companies to be separated and made independent are as follows: The Railway Company, with the Railway Department of the current main SMR department as the main body, will be entrusted by (Manchukuo) to manage the United Railways General Bureau, the North Korean Railway Administration Bureau, and the Railway Construction Bureau to establish a new railway company to manage the railway business. The Coal Company, with the Fushun Coal Mine as the center, will merge the Benxihu, Yantai, and Laotouman coal mines to completely control the coal mining business. Other national undertakings such as the Showa Steel Works, the Manchurian Chemical Industry Company, and the currently planned gold mining, electricity, petroleum, automobile, and forestry industries will be provided with capital by the holding company. (4) As a general rule, the administration of the current affiliated territories will be transferred to (Manchukuo). However, because the current period is too early and due to (Manchukuo)'s finances, the holding company will temporarily exercise administrative power. August of the fourth year of Datong (Manchukuo) will be the first period for the abolition of extraterritoriality. (5) The SMR has traditionally been under the dual supervision of the Colonial Ministry and the Kwantung Army. Now, it will be solely supervised by the commander of the Kwantung Army, who is the supreme commander in Manchuria. (13th Japan League News dispatch)</p>

<h3>Britain and France Resist Japanese Goods: Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Final Steps, France Considering Raising Tariffs</h3>

<p>(Paris) At a meeting of the House of Representatives Tariff Committee, Minister of Commerce Laurent-Eynac gave a detailed presentation on various issues related to French economic policy, such as exchange rate adjustment surcharges. Laurent advocated completely abolishing the exchange rate adjustment surcharge and presented the opinions put forward by Britain, stating that currency devaluation cannot be regarded as a form of dumping. For example, after the Japanese yen depreciated, Japanese exports increased, which greatly impacted British exports to Far Eastern colonies. However, the British government did not seek to impose an exchange rate adjustment surcharge on Japanese goods based on this reason. In addition, Laurent advocated that the abolition of the exchange rate adjustment surcharge should be carried out simultaneously with tightening import quotas to avoid various speculative behaviors. The Tariff Committee unanimously passed the Minister of Commerce's declaration. The chairman of the committee then asked the Minister of Commerce what measures the government should take to prevent the dangerous competition faced by French industry due to Japanese exports. At this time, Socialist Representative Simon spoke, saying that the prices of Japanese silk and cloth imported from Japan are equal, while the price of Japanese-made electric lights in France is equal to the price of glass. The Minister of Commerce replied that he was also very concerned about the problems caused by Japanese exports and was currently considering various tariff measures to seek redress.

<h3>The Chaco War: Paraguay's Army Achieves a Great Victory; Citizens Celebrate Wildly; Thirteen Bolivian Regiments Captured and Disarmed; Eighteen Months of Warfare May Be Nearing an End; Argentina Initiates a Non-Aggression Pact Among South American Nations</h3>
<p>Asuncion, tonight: The entire population of Paraguay is jubilant, celebrating the unprecedented victory of the Paraguayan army in the Chaco region. The news from La Paz that Bolivia is mobilizing reservists has further convinced the Paraguayan people of the veracity of the War Department's reports of victory, increasing their fervor. Crowds throng the notice boards outside newspaper offices, day and night, and commercial activity throughout the city has nearly ceased. From noon until late at night, delirious citizens march in parades through the streets, celebrating this unprecedented triumph. Paraguayan President Ayala flew to the front lines yesterday to personally witness the surrender and capture of the thirteen encircled Bolivian regiments. Upon his return to the capital this afternoon, tens of thousands of people had gathered at the airport outside the city, eager to hear the President's news of victory. The President then announced to the crowd that a total of 8,950 Bolivian officers and soldiers had been captured, prompting thunderous applause. According to the initial report yesterday, only 1,500 had been captured. However, this morning the War Department announced that the number of enemy soldiers surrendering totaled thirteen regiments, or 8,250 men. Now, the President announced an additional 700, making this victory for the small nation of Paraguay a truly historic one, the first of its kind since its founding. Conversely, in Bolivia, it can be considered an unprecedented defeat. Therefore, according to unconfirmed reports, the Bolivian government is considering dismissing the German advisor, General Kundt, who heads the General Staff. The fighting continues, with the Paraguayan army attempting to consolidate its newly acquired positions. (Twelfth National Telegram)</p>
<p>La Paz: The Bolivian government today ordered the mobilization of reservists from the classes of 1917 to 1920 to reinforce the Chaco region.

<p>The capital of Paraguay, tonight: The Paraguayan capital celebrates Paraguay's victory in the Chaco forest region. It is reported that 13,000 Bolivian soldiers surrendered, and that many cannons, tanks, and millions of rounds of ammunition were captured by the Paraguayan army. It is believed that this decisive battle may resolve the fifty-year dispute between the two countries. This war has lasted for eighteen months. In the first year, both sides had victories and defeats. According to Bolivia, Paraguay first attacked a certain fort, leading to the outbreak of war. Formal declarations of war were made at the end of August last year. Paraguay immediately conscripted 15,000 troops and launched a large-scale offensive. Bolivia, however, was hampered by poor and circuitous roads, stretching for a thousand miles, with the distance between the battlefield and the supply base being twice that of Paraguay, resulting in a gradual retreat over three months. The Paraguayan offensive stopped five months after the war, having suffered considerable casualties. Subsequently, Bolivia took advantage of Paraguay's unpreparedness and launched a counterattack during the rainy season, capturing six Paraguayan forts and reclaiming eight lost Bolivian forts. The war then became quiet, with only artillery battles occurring. Now, according to war reports, the Bolivian army was unable to sustain the conflict, and victory has ultimately gone to Paraguay. It is estimated that no less than 10,000 people have died in the Chaco region, with even more injured. (Twelfth Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Telegram: Our Government Dumps American Cotton; Japanese Merchants Decide Not to Buy</h3>
<p>Osaka: According to a telegram received by the Osaka Municipal Industry Department, the Chinese government, facing recent financial difficulties, has decided to dispose of American cotton and wheat as soon as possible. The initial selling price was not significantly different from the market price of ordinary American cotton, but recently, the price has been reduced by two and a half or three yuan, resulting in a dumping policy that has severely impacted cotton merchants. However, Japanese spinning mills are not buying cotton due to national policy considerations, and Chinese merchants are also unable to import due to financial difficulties. Of the 800,000 bales, buyers have been confirmed for only 50,000 to 60,000 bales. (Thirteenth Japanese United Telegram)</p>

<h3>Rifts Within the U.S. Treasury Department: Under Secretary Hughes Resigns Again</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury Hughes resigned today, becoming the first casualty of Acting Secretary Morgenthau's reorganization of the Treasury Department. It is also widely rumored that Treasury Secretary Woodin will soon formally leave the department. Furthermore, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Cummings, due to disagreements with Morgenthau on monetary policy, is also said to be planning to resign after New Year's Day. Hughes was recommended by Woodin and is considered a conservative figure. A week ago, Acting Secretary Morgenthau had a dispute with Hughes, ordering that reports from the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Secret Service be sent directly to the Secretary and not to Under Secretary Hughes. Recently, Morgenthau also promoted Perry, a former Wall Street banker, granting him the real power of an Under Secretary. As a result, Hughes had no choice but to resign. Today, when the White House announced Hughes's resignation, it also released the President's letter of consolation to Hughes, which was worded warmly, expressing the hope that he would soon return to work together. Treasury Secretary Woodin is currently recuperating in the South. Today, he was reported to be on a week-long fishing trip in the Gulf of California with the Governor of Sonora, Mexico, Calles. While the White House denied that he intended to resign, rumors are rampant. (Twelfth National Telegram)</p>

<h3>U.S. Proposes to Britain: Talk of Stabilizing Exchange Rates; Official Circles Remain Silent</h3>
<p>(London) Although rumors of the United States proposing a joint U.S.-British stabilization of the dollar and pound exchange rates are rife in business circles here, official circles remain silent. The feeling is that while such a development is necessary, the time is not yet ripe for it to be realized. The dollar exchange market was calm today. Regardless of whether discussions are underway or not, operators have become cautious and unwilling to act rashly. It is reported that the British view is that stabilization on a gold standard is impossible until international banking cooperation is established, ensuring that the gold standard no longer fluctuates in value as it did previously. As for other methods of stabilizing the pound and dollar exchange rates outside of the gold standard, they cannot be undertaken until the results of the current U.S. currency policy are clearly visible. Furthermore, U.S. prices have not yet adjusted to the lower dollar value, as has occurred with the pound and the franc. This is also a matter of great concern to the British banking community. France experienced a currency devaluation after the war, but it was only temporary. Whether the United States will have the same experience as France is a matter of differing opinions. As these doubts exist, it is generally predicted that the British government will not change its wait-and-see currency policy. (Twelfth Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Kailuan Coal Mine Taxes to be Paid According to Law Hereafter</h3>

<h3>The Coal Industry Association Requests the Issuance of Coal Industry Bonds; The Ministry of Industry Will Discuss the Matter at a Relief Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Coal Industry Association resolved to request the government to issue 20 million yuan of coal industry bonds. An official from the Ministry of Industry said that the 20 million yuan of coal industry bonds was approved in June of this year by a meeting of national mining representatives convened by the Ministry, but the Ministry of Finance did not agree to it, and it has been shelved since then. The Ministry supports the matter, as the issuance of these bonds does not conflict with the government's issued bonds. The security, repayment of principal, and payment of interest are all the responsibility of the miners themselves. However, the Ministry of Finance must approve it in accordance with the law before it can be issued. As the Coal Industry Association has urged action, the Ministry plans to convene another national coal relief conference in the coming days, where it will be resubmitted for discussion.

<h3>Our Country's Foreign Trade is Sluggish</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Our country's foreign trade has been sluggish in recent years. Last year, before the loss of the Northeastern customs, there was not much of a trade deficit. This year, due to the exclusion of the Northeastern customs, the trade deficit for just the first six months of the year amounted to a huge 474,641,566 yuan. The International Trade Bureau estimates that the import of cotton and wheat, valued at 50 million U.S. dollars, will occur in the second half of this year due to the establishment of the cotton and wheat loan. The total trade deficit for this year may therefore increase to approximately 87 million to 90 million yuan. (Thirteenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Mongolians in Beiping Welcome Huang Shaohong, Hoping to Recover Lost Mongolian Lands</h3>
<p>Huang Encourages Princes and Young People to Work Together to Achieve Harmony. The Mongolian Association in Beiping held a meeting at 2 PM today (the 12th) in Zhongshan Park to welcome Huang Shaohong. About 500 Mongolians attended. Huang Shaohong arrived at the meeting at 1:50 PM. First, Nayantu delivered a welcome speech, followed by Zhao Fuhai, a Mongolian representative. Then, Mr. Huang gave a reply. Finally, Bai Yunshu, representing all Mongolians, presented Mr. Huang with five points of hope. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Nayantu's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Nayantu's welcome speech briefly stated: (Today, we are using such simple and crude refreshments to welcome Minister Huang, who has promoted Mongolian autonomy, making us feel extremely ashamed. When the Minister was ordered to go north, we had prepared to hold a grand welcome meeting to welcome the Minister and express our humble respect. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to hold it. Now, the Minister has returned from a very short inspection, paying attention to the country and the ancient ethnic groups, and creating many future benefits for Mongolia. How grateful we are to all our fellow villagers. I am now able to witness the rebirth of Mongolia in my old age, and I would like to express my gratitude to the Central Government and Minister Huang on behalf of all Mongolians in Beiping.)</p>
<h3>Mongolian Representative's Plea</h3>
<p>Zhao Fuhai, a representative of the Mongolian Association, gave a speech with a lot of pleading, briefly stating: (Today's welcome meeting is better said to be a commemoration of the rebirth of Mongolia. In other words, it is also a memorial day for the revival of the Mongolian nation within the great Chinese nation. Therefore, on this day of honor and gratitude, there are things that cannot be unsaid. As for whether it is appropriate, I ask the Minister to forgive me. First, the mystery of Mongolian autonomy, which has been clamoring for a long time, has now been revealed. When the autonomy movement was about to begin, the Central Government and the general public, because they did not understand the truth, suspected that it had a background and said it was a separatist movement, a manifestation of rebellion, wiping out the pure and innocent national self-determination movement, causing great blows and traumas to the Mongolian nation, which had not yet grown its feathers, making the nation that still lived in the ancient times in the 20th century and the nation that suffered the non-humanitarian times never see the light of day again. We are heartbroken, we are saddened by the fate of the nation. Unexpectedly, the angel-like Minister gave the ancient Mongolia supreme blessings, promoting Mongolian autonomy, which makes us infinitely grateful. Therefore, we earnestly request the Minister to report what he has seen this time to the Central Government truthfully, so that the Central Government and society can truly understand and recognize this pure and innocent national movement, and hope that the Central Government can support this autonomy with a sincere attitude in the future. Second, the principles of autonomy were decided by the Minister on behalf of the Central Government and the presidium of the Mongolian Autonomy Conference. But when will it be realized? When will the Mongolian people, who are in the eighteenth level of hell, be rescued and brought to heaven? In fact, history tells us that all the past politics of the country were meetings without discussion, discussions without decisions, and decisions without action. Now that the principles of Mongolian autonomy have been decided, we dare not predict whether it will repeat the past political mistakes. We earnestly hope that the Minister's efforts in the future will be fully completed. We definitely do not want it to be aborted or be a flash in the pan. If it is successful, please ask the Central Government to take into account that this is national self-determination, this is the demand of the entire people, not the demand of anyone. To solve this problem, we must consider the people and start from the bottom. We hope that the Central Government will do its best to support it and not have any destructive places. Third, the Mongolian compatriots who have strayed into Beiping are mostly people from Zhuozhao Zhehu and other places. They have abandoned their hometowns, they have grief hidden in their hearts, and they are mostly intellectuals who love the motherland. Now their lives are in great panic. Please help the Minister in particular. We do not want to be saved by those who we know are undeserving. We hope to set a strategy for recovering lost territories as soon as possible. We, the people who have strayed into the interior, are willing to be the vanguard to take back the beautiful mountains and rivers that have changed color from the hands of the enemy, even at the cost of sacrifice. Our welcome is a tearful welcome, a painful honor. Finally, in the midst of gratitude, we wish the Minister, who is working hard for the country, a limitless career and good health.)</p>
<h3>Huang Shaohong's Speech</h3>
<p>Briefly stated: (Today, everyone's grand welcome is really undeserved. I was ordered to inspect Inner Mongolia this time, and at the same time, I encountered the issue of autonomy in Inner Mongolia. The scope of inspection is very broad, especially the issue of autonomy is the most important. When the issue of autonomy first arose, the country and abroad did not receive correct information, resulting in a bad impression. My brothers went north from Beijing to Beiping, and Mongolian compatriots provided many materials and went to Bailingmiao together to help solve the autonomy issue. After arriving at Bailingmiao, most of the princes and people met each other with sincerity. In a short period of time, the autonomy issue was successfully resolved. The central government and individuals are very grateful. Just now, I heard many words from the chairman and Comrade Zhao. My brothers feel that the past has come to an end. We must study how to achieve the purpose of reforming the past in the future. It cannot be done by the government and individuals alone, but by the compatriots and the government. To revive Mongolia, we should not only obey the central government, but also not completely depend on the government. Every Mongolian is responsible. The central government's attitude towards Mongolian affairs this time is to hope for a thorough solution. The central government has considered how to enable cooperation between officials and civilians, how to enable Mongolians to enjoy equal treatment in politics and economy, and how to make the local and government always harmonious so that they can proceed according to the central government's pre-set plans to save the Mongolians from water and fire. Finally, it was decided to send me to Mongolia to inspect, and all those who have a vested interest in the Mongolians are included in the central government's plan and are extremely eager to handle it. Therefore, all opinions contributed by Mongolians will be accommodated by the central government as much as possible. I went to Mongolia to inspect this time with the central government's intention and studied the actual situation to ensure that Mongolian affairs are resolved as soon as possible. This is not only what the Mongolian compatriots hope for, but also what the central government is eagerly looking forward to. My brothers have stayed in the Chahar and Suiyuan provinces for a long time, and have a detailed understanding of the Mongolian situation. After returning to Beijing, I will report my findings to the central government, so that the central government can have an extremely appropriate plan for handling Mongolian affairs. Regarding this point, I especially hope that Mongolian compatriots who are more familiar with the Mongolian situation than me will contribute their opinions to complete this mission. In order to find a concrete plan to solve Mongolian affairs, yesterday I specially invited professors from various universities in Beiping and experts who studied Mongolian affairs to gather together, hoping to study in detail a shortcut to save Mongolia, so as to provide the government with a direction for dealing with Mongolian affairs. The final conclusion of the research is that this is a factual issue, and it can only be effective if it is done from a practical point of view. It can be seen that today's Mongolian issue cannot be solved by words alone. Therefore, I suggest to the Mongolian youth that all Mongolians who are determined to save their ancestors should return to the Mongolian yurt in Mongolia and do it in practice before there is hope. We should always keep in mind two points: (1) Do not forget that you are a Mongolian. (2) You should also understand the differences between Mongolia and any other place. The reason why Mongolia has become what it is today is due to 300 years of accumulated habits. Therefore, like a person's disease, 300 years of old disease cannot be cured overnight. The same is true for Mongolian affairs. We must start from the root. Every time there is internal strife in China, it gives foreigners the opportunity to invade. You should be able to see this point. At this time of frequent foreign troubles, it is also a good phenomenon that the Mongolian nation has been able to realize this. Finally, I hope that all Mongolians, princes, and youth will work together in harmony under the leadership of the government to overcome this national crisis, then the Chinese nation will also have great hope.)</p>
<h3>Bai Yunti's Opinions</h3>
<p>Finally, Bai Yunti, a Mongolian member of the Central Committee, contributed his opinions, briefly stating: (A person has a few opinions to contribute: (1) The status of the district government should be equal to that of the province, directly under the central government, and the administration of the League flag should not be controlled by the provincial government. (2) Mongolian and Tibetan education should be implemented in accordance with the central government's regulations, allocating 240,000 yuan each year for Mongolian and Tibetan education to cultivate Mongolian and Tibetan youth, and selecting five young people to study abroad each year as stipulated. (3) It is hoped that those who are familiar with the situation in Mongolia and Tibet will preside over Mongolian and Tibetan politics. (4) It is hoped that the Mongolian and Tibetan people will be treated equally in accordance with central laws. (5) We should seek good ways to achieve Inner Mongolian autonomy, and the income in Mongolian and Han mixed areas must be thoroughly advocated for equal distribution.) (Twelfth Jin)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Move to Woye in Western Suiyuan || Departure to the West in Early January Next Year || Wang Shiping Talks About the Process of Moving</h3>
<p>Beiping News, Sun Dianying's troops, the commander of the 41st Army, were previously ordered to go to the western district of Qinghai for land reclamation. However, due to the rejection expressed by the three provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, the central government telegraphed Sun's troops to temporarily stop and wait for orders in the Baotou and Wuyuan area. Subsequently, after Sun Dianying sent personnel to contact Yan Xishan in Taiyuan, it was decided to move to the Woye administrative district, the westernmost part of the Ikzhao League in southwestern Suiyuan. The move is scheduled to begin in January next year. Yan has allowed this plan. Wang Shiping, the representative of Sun's troops stationed in Beiping, visited He Yingqin today to report and requested a telegram to the central government. In addition, in order to prevent Sun's army from going west, the Ningxia army once transferred a part of its troops east. The army has now arrived at Dengkou, the border between Suiyuan and Ningxia. Ma Hongkui, the chairman of Ningxia, did not know that Sun's army had moved to western Suiyuan, and telegraphed his representative stationed in Beiping, Bai Jianmin, to visit Huang Shaohong and ask him to convey to the central government to thoroughly resolve the issue of Sun's army going west, so as to avoid further disputes next spring. Bai visited Huang at 9 AM yesterday (the 11th) and stated everything. Huang has agreed to convey it to the central government. According to Wang Shiping, Sun's army was ordered to reclaim land in the western district of Qinghai, and it was originally scheduled to go west immediately. One-third of the army had advanced to Yangshumu, Mutou, Junliangtai, and Sanshenggong and other places east of Pingluo (100 li north of the capital of Ningxia Province). The remaining two-thirds, about 30,000 people, were also concentrated in the Wuyuan, Linhe, and Sanjiadian area. Subsequently, they received an order from the Military Affairs Commission to temporarily stop at the original garrison. However, as the severe winter was approaching, the desert area extending from Wuyuan and Linhe to Yangshumu was thousands of miles long, and the winter was cold with seasonal winds, which the locals call the "white hair wind." The wind was extremely strong, and there were no houses to live in, so the garrison had to find a way to move to another place for the winter. After Sun sent personnel to Taiyuan to contact Director Yan, he agreed to lend the Woye administrative district, which borders Ningxia in southwestern Suiyuan, for the army to garrison. The area is about 500 li long from north to south and 200 li wide from east to west. The land is fertile and arable. It was originally a pastoral area of the Inner Mongolia Ikzhao League. Recently, the Suiyuan Province established an autonomous bureau there. There are no Jin and Sui troops stationed there. The army is scheduled to cross the Yellow River south from Wuyuan, Linhe, Sanshenggong and other places in early January next month (that is, January next year) and move to garrison in that area. After the spring warms, it will build houses in the area and lease land from the Mongolian people for land reclamation. Before receiving the order to go west, it will not move elsewhere for the time being. Commander Sun will also go with the army when the army moves, and the military headquarters will move to the Woye administrative bureau. (Twelfth Jin)</p>
<h3>Kong's Bandits in Southern Hubei Suffer Heavy Losses = Plan to Destroy the Traffic on the Xiang-E Road = Besieged Tongshan and Were Heavily Killed</h3>
<p>Hankou News, the counties in southern Hubei have been disturbed by Kong Hechong's banditry, and the local order has been completely destroyed. Last year, the two major bandit nests of Longgang and Yanxia were recovered by the National Army, and the bandits fled to the Jiangxi border in secret. Between May and June of this year, He Jian's troops in Hunan Province repeatedly defeated the bandits on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi. As a result, the bandits scattered and fled back to Hubei in order to prolong their lives. The troops stationed in southern Hubei were originally under the command of Chen Jicheng, and the deployment was very strict. However, due to the mountainous terrain, the bandits were still able to invade. By October and November, they gradually became active again. They had attempted to rob the Xiang-E road twice, and recently, an attack on the city occurred. It is reported that the bandits were the pseudo-Third Division, which had recently been reorganized by the pseudo-Division Commander Ye Jinbo. A few days ago, they gathered in Chongyang and planned to invade Xianning, Tingsiqiao, and Jinnian, which belongs to Echeng, in order to destroy the northern section of the Xiang-E road. With a force of six regiments, they attacked Tongshan on the 8th, besieging Tongshan severely on three sides. At that time, the National Army had made some adjustments. Rong's troops were transferred to the southern section of the Ping-Kui road from Liujiamiao in Hankou to Wushengguan. Li's troops, originally stationed in eastern Hubei, were transferred to southern Hubei. The defense of the four counties of Chongyang, Puqi, Tongshan, and Tongcheng were all taken over by Feng's troops. When the bandits' power revived, Feng happened to be in Hankou. Upon hearing the alarm, he returned to the defense and immediately transferred troops to gather at Heshengqiao and Tingsiqiao to closely protect the road and advance to suppress them. On one hand, he sent troops to rescue Tongshan. There were not many troops stationed in Tongshan, and they fought fiercely with the bandits for one day and one night. The situation gradually became critical. On the 9th, reinforcements arrived in large numbers and attacked from inside and outside, breaking through the main force of the bandits, killing more than 200 bandits and capturing four bandit leaders, including Ming Daosheng, the chairman of the pseudo-District Government, and Zhang Yunshan, the pseudo-Military Minister. The bandits suffered a heavy blow and fled back to the old nest of Damoshan. The siege of Tongshan was lifted. Feng, seeing that the bandits were retreating, was gathering friendly forces to launch a large-scale campaign to suppress them, and organized guerrillas to search for scattered bandits. He also supervised the people to organize grain looting teams to cut off the bandits' supplies. Currently, Yangxin, Daye, Echeng, Jiayu and other counties are still peaceful. The armies are unanimously strengthening their fortifications, and the defensive works in Yangxin, Daye, Echeng, Jiayu, Tongshan, Tongcheng, Puqi, Chongyang, and Xianning counties are extremely strong. The remaining bandits will have no chance to be active again. (Twelfth)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Eastern Jiangxi Invade Caifang and Huangken</h3>
<p>Troops from Southern Jiangxi have driven back various bandit gangs. Guangzhou News, the communist bandits in Eastern Jiangxi have recently attempted to steal and plot to contain the situation. The bandits in Junmen, the pseudo 22nd Division, sent a group to harass Yuanxi a few days ago. On the 3rd of this month, another group suddenly raided Caifang near Anyuan. Fortunately, the Ye Division of the First Army had made preparations in advance, and immediately gave a head-on blow when the bandits came. According to a telegram report from the First Army Headquarters, as follows: (According to the telegram from Division Commander Ye Jiangwei, early this morning, it was reported that there were about 200 to 300 bandits of the 64th Regiment of the pseudo 22nd Division who arrived at Caifang from Junmen Ridge. A team was immediately dispatched to encircle and suppress them, killing more than a dozen bandits, seizing a water machine gun, ten rifles, nineteen hand grenades, ten iron hats, capturing eight prisoners, a mule and horse, a load of propaganda, etc. Respectfully reported, Yu Hanmou bows in support). Also, on the evening of the 1st of this month, more than 500 communist bandits in Ruijin raided Huangken near Anyuan and Xunwu. This place was previously garrisoned by the Wang Zanbin Division of the Guangxi Army. When the bandit alarm was received, the Wang Division sent a part of its troops to Huangken on the morning of the 2nd to suppress the bandits. The bandits also resisted stubbornly by setting up formations in dangerous places. After a fierce battle of three hours, the bandits ran out of ammunition and fled back to Ruijin. The Wang Division did not pursue them due to unfamiliar terrain, but in this battle, more than 100 bandits were killed, more than 30 guns were seized, more than 10 bandits were captured, and two key members of the Ruijin Soviet were captured alive. The division has reported to its superiors for review on the 3rd of this month. (December 8th)</p>
<h3>Economic Committee Promotes Rural Sanitation and Cooperation in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>-Mei Yilin Arrives in Nanchang to Establish an Office- Nanchang News, the National Economic Committee decided to establish offices in Xi'an and Jiangxi, and designated Jiangxi and Jiangsu as sanitation experimental areas. The committee, led by Mei Yilin, dozens of UN technical staff, experts, and office staff, arrived in Jiangxi last month and established an office outside of Germany, and started to work. The bandits in Jiangxi aim to bankrupt the countryside. In the future, to eradicate the roots of the bandits, it is urgent to relieve the countryside. Although the National Government previously decided to allocate 15 million yuan for fundamental solutions in bandit areas and 2 million yuan for temporary solutions, only 600,000 yuan of the 2 million yuan for temporary solutions has been allocated. The amount for fundamental solutions is still out of reach. The Economic Committee is currently working on rural sanitation and cooperation in Jiangxi, and the rest are placed in the second step. Regarding sanitation, it was decided to start from Nanchang and extend it to other counties. All promotion and construction of sanitation in provincial capitals and rural areas have been planned by the office in detail and implemented step by step to reduce the mortality rate and maintain the health of the people. The staff of various agencies in the provincial capital have established a sanitation inspection committee to inspect the cleanliness of the families of civil servants. The sanitation administration inside and outside the city is much more tense than before. Even the villages near the city have been ordered by the provincial government to the Public Security Bureau and the city defense department to ban dirt. As for rural cooperation, the Economic Committee is preparing to carry out large-scale efforts in order to popularize it. The capital will be allocated from the cotton and wheat loan funds and re-loaned to farmers. All measures have not yet been officially announced. (December 8th)</p>
<h3>Lu West Various Counties Request Speedy Dredging of the Zhao Wang River</h3>
<p>Hoping the government will allocate funds for work-relief. A Jinan dispatch reports that this year's Yellow River breach relied on the discharge of various rivers, greatly mitigating the water damage. However, the Zhao Wang River around Juye and Yuncheng has not been dredged, despite the Construction Department's detailed survey and the formulation of a dredging plan, which was delayed by other matters. As a result, the river is increasingly silted up due to years of disrepair, causing severe harm. Currently, the people of Juye, Yuncheng, Heze, and Juan County have jointly appointed representatives to request funds from the provincial government to expedite the dredging. Huang Yunting, the representative of Yuncheng County, and Huang Zhaogan, the representative of Juye County, arrived in Jinan yesterday (the 10th). Today (the 11th) at 2 PM, they went to the Construction Department to petition. Section Chief Cao Li of the Second Section received them. The representatives stated the need to expedite the dredging of the Zhao Wang River in Lu West to prevent flooding, as past plans required local funding, but the Lu West counties, severely affected by floods, are unable to bear the cost. They requested the government to allocate funds and implement a work-relief program to carry out the dredging, which would achieve two goals at once. Cao replied that he would discuss and consider methods within possible limits and suggested requesting Chairman Han to telegraph the central government for funding would be even better. The representatives then left, reportedly planning to visit Han Fuqu the day after tomorrow to request assistance and to petition the provincial relief organizations, such as the Relief Office.

<h3>After the Increase in Consolidated Tax, Shandong's Match and Cigarette Industries =Match Industry to go Bankrupt= =Cigarette Industry to be Suspended=</h3>
<p>A Jinan dispatch reports that the increase in consolidated tax has been implemented since the 5th of this month. The Zhenye Company, Jinan's largest match factory, is significantly affected. According to Zhou Bingru, the company's public relations officer, (Jinan has three match companies: Zhenye, Luxing, and Dongyuan. Zhenye is the largest, employing over 200 workers in the manufacturing department and over 800 in the packaging department. In addition, no less than 3,000 poor families depend on box pasting. It is estimated that over 10,000 city residents rely on the match industry for a living.) Before the tax increase, Zhenhua Company produced 60 to 70 boxes of matches per day. Each box is divided into six small boxes, totaling 1,440 small packets. The cost per box was around 27-28 yuan, plus 10 yuan in consolidated tax, while the selling price was only about 38 yuan, leaving no profit and covering all expenses at a loss. Now, with an additional 17 yuan in consolidated tax, each box requires a tax of 27 yuan, making it practically unsellable. Before the tax increase, speculators, learning of the impending increase, rushed to order goods from the company, selling out all existing stock and exceeding supply. However, since the tax increase, no transactions have taken place. To avoid stockpiling, the company has adopted a semi-shutdown approach, reducing daily production from 70 boxes to only 30 to 40. Other companies are also in a situation where they can neither afford to shut down nor continue operating. The future is bleak and unimaginable. The Qingdao Match Industry Association has elected representatives to petition the Shanghai Consolidated Tax Bureau to rescind the order. Jinan lacks a trade organization. Besides following the instructions of the Qingdao counterparts, the three companies have jointly sent letters to various organizations and groups requesting assistance. If negotiations fail, the match industry will face overall bankruptcy. Matches are a daily necessity, indispensable to both rich and poor, unlike luxury goods. Moreover, if the companies collapse, a large number of workers will lose their jobs, raising concerns about social security. In the past, the market was heavily influenced by foreign goods, with Japanese products selling better than domestic products throughout the province. There is concern that this will create an even better opportunity for foreigners, which is deeply regrettable. Only two cigarette factories in Jinan manufacture cigarettes: Beiyang Dong Yulong and Mingchang. Both are small-scale. The Beiyang Dong Yulong cigarette factory has a capital of 20,000 yuan, three cigarette-making machines, and employs over 30 workers. It produces a dozen boxes per day, with brands such as Minghu, Fighting Cock, and Baotu Spring, all of which are lower-grade, coarse cigarettes. Mingchang is even smaller, with only one cigarette-making machine. The Lu Yu Area Consolidated Tax Bureau has a branch in Jinan for tax collection, generating only about 20,000 yuan per month. Now, with the increase in tax rates, the tax on boxes originally taxed at 55 yuan has increased to 80 yuan, and the tax on boxes originally at 90 yuan has increased to 160 yuan. After calculation, the monthly tax revenue could reach 30,000 yuan. However, the increased tax and higher costs will negatively impact sales. With reduced production, it is questionable whether the expected 30,000 yuan can be collected in full. Two cigarette factories, Cheng An and Huatong, are under preparation in the city. After the tax increase, whether to continue their preparation is under careful study. (Eleventh)</p>
<h3>11th Anniversary of Qingdao's Recovery</h3>
<p>A Qingdao dispatch reports that December 10th marked the 11th anniversary of Qingdao's recovery. The municipal government held a commemorative ceremony in the municipal government auditorium on that day. Last year, for the 10th anniversary, Mayor Shen Honglie invited elderly people over 80 years old from various townships to Qingdao to participate and inquire about their hardships. This year, to understand the local situation, Mayor Shen specially convened township, district, and village chiefs, as well as school affairs committee members, to inquire about the conditions in various townships and districts to adopt improvements. Township and village chiefs arrived in Qingdao on the 9th, transported by cars and ships provided by the municipal government. This included two district chiefs, 54 village chiefs, and 30 school affairs committee members from Cangkou District; two district chiefs, 96 village chiefs, and 30 school affairs committee members from Licun District; one district chief, 18 village chiefs, and two school affairs committee members from Yindao District; two district chiefs and 62 village chiefs from Jiushui District; one district chief and 31 village chiefs from Xuejiadao District; two district chiefs from the first district of the urban area; one district chief from the second district; and one district chief from the third district, totaling 335 people. The details of today's commemorative ceremony are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Meeting Situation: This morning at 8:00 AM, the commemorative ceremony was held in the municipal government auditorium. In addition to the above-mentioned township and village chiefs, all personnel above the section chief level from the municipal government and its affiliated agencies were present. Guests included Liu Zhiping, a member of the city party headquarters, Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, representatives from the city's chamber of commerce, industry, and business, as well as many members of the press. The Public Security Bureau's military band also played music at the ceremony. After the meeting began, Mayor Shen Honglie gave a speech, followed by Liu Zhiping, a member of the city party headquarters, who spoke on behalf of the guests and expressed gratitude. Next, Sun Shian, a representative of the district chiefs, delivered a speech, elaborating on Mayor Shen's achievements in reorganizing the urban area and developing the rural areas, as well as the benefits received by the villagers. He led all the district and village chiefs in bowing three times to Mr. Shen to express their gratitude.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Report: He said that Qingdao was leased by the Germans in the 23rd year of Emperor Guangxu's reign in the Qing Dynasty and was developed with great effort, transforming it from a desolate fishing village into an important port for military and commercial purposes. In the third year of the Republic of China, when the European War broke out, the Japanese army attacked Qingdao and occupied it on November 7 of that year. After eight years, our country recovered Qingdao on December 10, in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. During this time, Qingdao was managed by the Germans for 17 years and by the Japanese for 8 years before it was returned to our land, restoring the homeland. This is why the city's recovery is commemorated with such solemnity. At the beginning of Qingdao's recovery, a foreign newspaper commented that Qingdao, after being recovered by China, would revert to its original fishing village state in ten years. Now, eleven years have passed since the recovery. During these eleven years, fortunately, the local officials in charge have been keen to reorganize everything. All construction has not only maintained the original state of the German and Japanese management era but has also been improved and expanded, becoming increasingly prosperous. (The following is a comparison of various situations before and after the recovery, the wording is omitted)</p>
<p>▲Awarding Certificates: Mayor Shen believes that the famous figures in the city's industrial and commercial circles, as well as the exemplary conduct and commendable morality of the people in the rural areas, are all models for society and should be commended. He specially prepared plaques and medals to be awarded separately during the recovery anniversary to show his encouragement of good deeds. In the rural areas, the Education Bureau awarded prizes to 76 people, including Lin Zhenji, (for good deeds); the Public Works Bureau awarded prizes to 22 people, including Xu Qianzhang, (for good deeds); the Social Affairs Bureau awarded prizes to 9 people, including Zheng Sunshi, (for filial piety); the Municipal Government awarded prizes to 9 people, including Zhang Yeshi, (for filial piety); the Social Affairs Bureau awarded prizes to 13 people, including Wang Junda, (for good deeds); the Municipal Government awarded prizes to 18 people, including Chen Kelian, (for good deeds); and the Public Security Bureau awarded prizes to 3 people, including Jiang Chonggao, (for good deeds). In the urban area, the winners included 12 people in the industrial sector, including Zheng Qintang, and 9 people in the commercial sector, including Song Yuting.</p>
<p>▲Soliciting Public Opinion: After the recovery anniversary, the district and village chiefs were led by reception personnel to the Yingbin Hotel (the mayor's official residence). The bureau chiefs inquired separately from the district chiefs and school affairs committee members. The director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chu Zhen, inquired from the first and fifth districts, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Shize, inquired from the second and sixth districts, the director of the Education Bureau, Lei Fazhang, inquired from the third and seventh districts, the director of the Finance Bureau, Guo Binghe, inquired from the fourth and eighth districts, the director of the Port Affairs Bureau, Yuan Fangqiao, inquired from the ninth district, the director of the Public Works Bureau, Xing Qixin, inquired from the tenth district, the director of the Agricultural and Forestry Office, Ge Jingying, inquired from the eleventh district, and the director of the Observatory, Jiang Bingran, inquired from the twelfth district. Mayor Shen also personally supervised the inspections. The bureau chiefs inquired in detail about the matters that should be developed or reformed in the local public works, public security, social affairs, education, agriculture, forestry, and finance. The district and village chiefs also stated the facts, which fully demonstrated the spirit of cooperation between officials and the people. After the inquiry, Mr. Shen hosted a luncheon at the People's Education Center to entertain the district and village chiefs. In the afternoon, personnel were sent to guide them to visit the People's Livelihood Factory, the Reformatory, the Relief Home, the Aquarium, the Sports Field, the Municipal Middle School, the Municipal Girls' Middle School, and the Taiping Road Elementary School. At 8 PM, the municipal government invited them to watch a play at the Grand Theater. At 8 AM on the 11th, the municipal government sent cars and small boats to return them to their respective districts. (December 10th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: County Magistrate Jin Inspects the Seawall</h3>
<p>The seawall at Jinshanwei and other places in Punan has collapsed and is in a dangerous state. County Magistrate Jin is paying special attention to it. Now, a letter has been received from the Shanghai Municipal Seawall Inspection Department, scheduling a joint inspection of the seawall. County Magistrate Jin approved the letter and scheduled to meet in Caojing on the 14th to travel together. This morning, he specially hired a car and led the special commissioner of the special office, Li Rusheng and Zhu Zhangqi, the director of the defense regiment, Wu Changding, and guards, to Nanhai to inspect the administration, justice, autonomy, and group affairs of Fengxian County, staying overnight, and tomorrow he will go to Caojing to jointly inspect the seawall.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Luo Wen'gan Arrives in Wuxi for Inspection</h3>
<p>Minister of Justice and Administration Luo Wen'gan recently departed from Nanjing to inspect judicial matters in various locations. Yesterday (the 13th) morning, he arrived in Wuxi from Suzhou on an express train, arriving at the port at 10:33 AM. Accompanying Mr. Luo were Lin Biao, President of the Jiangsu High Court; Shen Jiayi, President (appointed by the ministry) of the Shanghai Special District Court; Judge Fu Lin; Liu Yinglin, Third Section Chief of the Ministry of Justice's Prison Department; and a total of seven attendants. Those present at the station to welcome him from this county were Hall Chief Yan Shenyu, County Court President Xu Tigan, Chief Prosecutor Zhou Erkai, lawyer Li Zongtang, reporters Zhou Xinru and Chen Hongjun from the Xishan News Agency, reporters Su Xingwu and Zhou Hanquan from the Wuxi Daily, and several dozen reporters stationed in Wuxi by this newspaper. The county police brigade also sent a detachment of all officers, led by squadron leader Zhu Wenying, to the station for protection. When the train entered the platform, Mr. Luo and his party alighted amidst the strains of military music, nodding to the welcoming personnel. After alighting, Mr. Luo and the welcoming personnel drove to the Railway Hotel, opening rooms 24, 27, 28, and 29 to rest. This reporter submitted a name card and was granted an audience. He made a statement, briefly stating: "I departed from the capital only two days ago, first inspecting Suzhou, with satisfactory results. This time, I plan to stay in Wuxi for one day, and tomorrow (today) morning, I must proceed to Zhenjiang and Yangzhou for inspection. I previously toured Xinjiang for three months, where the ethnic groups are quite mixed. Currently, the most notable judicial cases in the country are: (1) the Noulens case has been concluded; (2) Zheng Yuxiu's case has been put on the wanted list; and (3) Chen Duxiu's case is under appeal." At that time, County Magistrate Yan was also present, reporting on the conditions of the Wuxi prisons and requesting a subsidy of 20,000 yuan from the Ministry of Justice to rebuild a new prison. Mr. Luo nodded in agreement. At around 11:00 AM, they traveled from the Railway Hotel to the county court, inspecting all the internal facilities and reviewing various documents. Then, they went to the prison department and separately inspected the narrow detention centers. Mr. Luo felt that the Wuxi prisons were too cramped and advocated for the urgent construction of a new prison. The rest of the facilities were satisfactory. At that time, Public Security Bureau Chief Li Wengong came to the court to pay his respects. Seeing that Mr. Luo had completed his inspection, he returned to the Railway Hotel to rest, planning to leave Wuxi today to inspect Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>Great Fire at Gongbei Tower Kills Two</h3>
<p>The area below the Diaoqiao Bridge outside the North Gate is where the commercial essence of the entire county is concentrated. The comings and goings of pedestrians are shoulder to shoulder all day, with extraordinary hustle and bustle. There is the famous teahouse Gongbei Tower, which sells dim sum in the morning and sets up a bathhouse in the evening, and business is extremely prosperous. At 9:30 yesterday morning, when the breakfast items were just being put on the market, a fire suddenly broke out on the ground floor of the building, instantly turning into a prairie fire. The guests in the teahouse, hearing the alarm, all ran away for their lives. Unfortunately, the stairs had already been burned off, and many people escaped by climbing down the adjacent flats. Some broke their shinbones, some broke their heads, and seven or eight people swam across the water to reach the other shore, but the weather was very cold, and they were injured by the frost. Two elderly men died in the flames and smoke because they could not escape in time, and their eyes were blinded. After the fire brigades dispatched dragons to rescue, the fire was extinguished. It is estimated that the entire Gongbei Tower building and two Huishang hotels opposite it were burned down.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Rioters of Yangzhong Escorted to the Province</h3>
<p>In the case of the villagers' riot against grain in Yangzhong, the county government of the county apprehended Geng Shengkuan, Zhu Anlan, Zhu Anlan, Ma Xintian and other thirteen people a few days ago, and yesterday they were escorted to the province to be sent to the security office for detention and trial. Also, after the incident in the county, the Security Department specially sent two companies of soldiers to Zhenwu. Now, one company has been ordered to be stationed in Shiying, and the local people are extremely panicked, because local rumors are very rampant, fearing that the foolish people will take the opportunity to raise another rebellion, so yesterday they sent personnel again, carrying telegraphs and documents to the province, to petition the Security Department to postpone the transfer of the troops stationed in Yangzhong, and at the same time actively preparing for local self-defense matters.</p>
<h3>Hua Zhen Punished with Six Months for Malfeasance</h3>
<p>After Hua Zhen, the former magistrate of Xinghua County, was sent to the court by Chairman Zhen, he was investigated by Prosecutor Zhu of the Prosecutor's Office, who determined that Hua Zhen was indeed guilty of malfeasance. He was indicted according to law and transferred to the criminal court for public trial. At 2:00 PM on the 9th of this month, presiding judge Ouyang Liang publicly tried the case in the Third Court, and after the debate concluded, he ordered Hua Zhen to be sent back to custody to await sentencing. At 3:00 PM this afternoon, presiding judge Ou ascended to the Fourth Court to announce the verdict in the case of Hua Zhen's malfeasance, sentencing him to six months' imprisonment. Hua Zhen requested to be released on bail in court, and the request was approved, and he was ordered to be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Warden Dismissed</h3>
<p>Zhu Jingbiao, the warden of the Nantong County Court's detention center, was charged with dismissal. The High Court appointed Lü Jiajun to replace him.</p>
<h3>Gu Renfa Did Not Come to Tong</h3>
<p>Because the provincial government appointed Zhao Yuxin to come to Tongcheng to handle the case, Zhao happened to come with Gu Minyu, causing all parties to mistakenly believe that Gu Renfa, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, had come to Tong anonymously to investigate. It has now been proven to be untrue. Zhao went to Chuan Port to search and seize the drug pill agency, capturing seven criminals, including Li Bu'ao, and escorted them to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Rugao: Pirates Kidnap People for Ransom</h3>
<p>Chen Jinxia, a fisherman from Changsha Fourteen General, Juegang County, has a sea boat named Rabbit Head. The day before yesterday, he sailed to the deep sea to hook razor clams. Suddenly, he encountered pirates who robbed both the boat and the people, beat the cook Xia Bihe, and detained five crew members, demanding a huge sum of money. When the families heard the news, they cried bitterly. Also, Zhao Datou's sea boat, led by Lao Da with twelve crew members, went to the deep ocean to hook razor clams the day before yesterday and was also kidnapped by pirates. Later, six people were released, and the remaining six people and the boat were detained for ransom. Also, at the sixteenth general port, on the evening of the fifth, five bandit boats sailed from the north and moored there, firing guns to show their power. The local residents were extremely frightened.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Unfilial Son Forces Mother to Death</h3>
<p>Jiang Qingheng, who runs an oil shop at the Caoxiangkou of Dongdajie outside the North Gate of this city, borrowed more than a hundred yuan from his separated mother because of limited capital. Later, he forced his mother to hand over the property contract for his own use, intending to make his mother repay the principal and interest of the borrowed hundred yuan. His mother's savings over the years had already been exhausted by Qingheng on weekdays. As for the debts, the creditors repeatedly urged her to pay, but she could not cope. The property contract was also taken away by Qingheng. She called for help but to no avail. The old woman really couldn't bear the poverty and disregarded her life. She hanged herself on the night of the day before yesterday, which is also tragic.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Female Student Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>A wealthy Zhang family in Xiludou Township, Tianning Town, has a daughter named Zhang Huiyun, who is studying at the Jiashan Zhongshan Girls' Middle School. She is naturally intelligent and has excellent grades. She is nineteen years old this year. Her parents thought that their daughter was at the age of marriage, but she was still single, so they were persuaded by the words of matchmakers and promised her to a Mr. Lu in Chengxi Town to be his wife, and they were going to formally get engaged on a chosen day. However, Huiyun did not agree to this marriage and asked her parents to cancel it, but the family refused her request and forced her to drop out of school and return home. Huiyun was so moved by this that she had the idea of committing suicide by drowning, so yesterday she carried the gold jewelry she usually used and left two sealed suicide notes, one to her mother and one to a Miss of her classmate, describing her opposition to despotic marriage and her being forced to commit suicide by drowning because of being unable to do anything else. This time she left, she was going to Zhapu to commit suicide by throwing herself into the sea.</p>
<h3>Farm Boats' Ship Tax Strictly Prohibited</h3>
<p>The provinces and counties have set up ship tax collection offices to collect ship tax, which has been going on for a long time. This time, Civil Affairs Director Lü Mishou toured Xitang Town, convened welcoming staff, held a discussion meeting, and exchanged opinions. Wang Gengli, the head of Xitang Town, and Xu Jingyi, a member of the Third District Party Department, and others stated the suffering of the people, including a detailed report on the collection of ship tax on farm boats, saying that when farmers came to the town to buy and transport manure or when the sick came for medical treatment, the ship insisted on checking the boats, and if they did not have a license, they would not be allowed to pass. The money for medical treatment and manure would be paid in full, which was not enough. Farmers did not dare to come to town, and business was therefore declining, and the rural economy was bankrupt. This kind of exorbitant tax should be exempted, etc. Mr. Lü was very appreciative when he heard this, and immediately instructed Wang Wenjin, the chief of the Third District, to prepare a written explanation on the spot and take it to the province for processing. It is now learned that the County Construction Department has received this instruction, and the prohibition of ship tax on farm boats will soon be realized.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Suicide Out of Economic Oppression</h3>
<p>Yang Jialin, a shareholder of the Hangzhou Tangxi Xintai Candy Shop, was touched by the fact that he could not get a loan from Yang Wenbao, the manager of the shop, and attempted suicide by swallowing raw opium, but failed. He then used a knife to cut his throat, and blood was flowing. The doctor's treatment was ineffective, and the wound festered until yesterday, and his breathing was irregular, and he died miserably. He left behind a wife and a daughter, and his funeral was funded by relatives and friends.</p>

<h3>Local News: Yin Tong Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Report on Railway Administration to Gu Mengyu =Says Negotiations on Opening of Beining Railway Completely Stalled= =Receiving the Great Wall Passes is Actively Underway= =Yin Will Return to Beijing Tonight, Staying Briefly Before Heading North Again=</h3>
<p>Yin Tong, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, arrived in Beijing a few days ago from Ping, and met with Wang Jingwei, the president of the Executive Yuan, to report on everything. Since Gu Mengyu, the Minister of Railways, was in Shanghai and had not returned, he took the night train from Beijing at 7:30 yesterday morning and drove straight to Gu Tiechang to report on the Beining Railway administration and to ask for instructions. Yin originally planned to return to Beijing on the night train last night, but since there are still important matters to be discussed with Gu Tiechang, he has postponed his departure from Shanghai until tonight, staying briefly in Beijing before heading north again. This newspaper's reporter interviewed Yin at his hotel last night, and the details of his remarks are recorded below.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Opening to Traffic is No Longer Being Discussed</h3>
<p>Yin first said that the purpose of my trip south was to report to the President on various matters in North China and to report to Minister Gu on the situation of the railway administration and to ask for instructions on everything. There are many discrepancies in the records of my remarks made during the trip. Today, I dare to tell you two points: (1) The issue of opening the Beining Railway to traffic is no longer being discussed, and no negotiations have been conducted recently. There are many speculations outside.</p>
<h3>Receiving the Great Wall is Underway</h3>
<p>(2) The report stated that in my remarks, the negotiations to receive the Great Wall passes were suspended due to orders from the central government, and how to proceed in the future would depend on the orders of the central government. This is completely contrary to the facts. The North China authorities are actively carrying out the reception, and have not received any central government reception orders at all. The report was caused by the reporter's mishearing.</p>
<p>Yin then elaborated on the progress of the traffic opening negotiations and the order to stop them, saying that the traffic opening negotiations came from the receipt of the Beining Railway. At that time, after the Japanese side returned the Beining Railway, they made the opening of the entire line a condition and agreed to start negotiations in October. I was the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, so in advance, I specially gathered railway administration experts inside and outside the bureau to study in detail and find a proper traffic opening plan under the conditions of not recognizing the puppet state and not ceding sovereignty and humiliating the country. Finally, I formulated two negotiation principles and submitted them to the Ministry of Railways for review and approval as a reference, as this was the extent of my responsibility. After several negotiations, the negotiations were completely stalled due to various difficulties, and have remained so until today. Yin finally said that he had met with Minister Gu today (yesterday) and would go to Shanghai and Beijing tomorrow (tonight), stay in Beijing for a few days, and then return north.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Visited Song to Discuss the Development of the Northwest and Proceeded to Handle It After Being Approved by the Economic Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai banking community has implemented investment in Shao Lizi, chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government. He had previously gone from Zhejiang to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Jiang, and has returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. He has been visiting Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Commission, to exchange views on the development of the Northwest. Shao is scheduled to return to Beijing at the end of this week to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and then return to Shaanxi. The Central News Agency's reporter visited Shao at his residence yesterday morning and made the following remarks.</p>
<h3>Mission to Jiangxi to Visit Jiang Two</h3>
<p>According to Shao, the purpose of my trip to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Jiang was to report on military affairs on behalf of Yang Hucheng and to discuss the development of the Northwest. Before I left Zhejiang for Jiangxi, Zhejiang was quite peaceful, and I had not heard of any conflicts occurring on the border between Fujian and Zhejiang. I am currently in Shanghai to treat my teeth, and I am scheduled to go to Beijing in three to five days to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, so that I can meet with my old friends, and then take the train back to Shaanxi.</p>
<h3>The Result of Meeting Song for Days is Satisfactory</h3>
<p>In the development of the Northwest, transportation and water conservancy are of the utmost importance. The Northwest is currently in extreme poverty and has no surplus capacity to devote to this, so I have repeatedly requested the Central Government and the National Economic Commission to assist in handling this matter. The National Economic Commission has now agreed to take on this important task. I have been visiting Chairman Song Ziwen for days to exchange ideas, and as a result, the results have been quite satisfactory. Once it is submitted to the Standing Committee of the Economic Committee for approval, it can be started, but what is currently planned to be implemented is only the minimum one-year plan, such as building the highway from Xi'an to Suzhou, etc., so that the Central Government will not feel financial difficulties. The second is to run a veterinary service, because the Northwest is a livestock area, and preventing animal plagues is a necessary plan. As for improving cotton seeds and other projects, they have been implemented in order under the provincial government's capabilities.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Banking Community Invests in the Northwest</h3>
<p>During my trip to Shanghai, I visited the leaders of the banking community in my personal capacity, telling them about the current situation in the Northwest and urging them to invest in the development of the Northwest. Zhang Gongquan had previously gone to the Northwest to inspect and had a very good impression and felt very satisfied. Shanghai Bank has already implemented investment in the Northwest and is running a cotton industry cooperation business. In the future, there must be many people who will follow in its footsteps and invest in the Northwest.</p>
<h3>French Envoy to Come to Shanghai Tonight to Return Home on French Mail Ship</h3>
<p>Mr. Weili De, the French envoy to China, has received permission from the French government to take a half-year leave of absence to return to his home country. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency learned from the French Consulate in Shanghai yesterday that Mrs. Weili De arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. The envoy is currently in Beijing to bid farewell to the various authorities of the National Government and is scheduled to take the night train from Beijing to Shanghai tonight, arriving at the port around 7:00 am tomorrow. At that time, the French Consul-General and others will go to welcome him. It is reported that after Envoy Weili De arrives in Shanghai, he will stay for one day before returning to his country on the French mail ship "L'Aussie." Mr. Crane Ah, a member of the French Senate, will accompany him. Furthermore, it is understood that after the French envoy returns to his country, he will discuss the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement in detail with the country's diplomatic authorities to finalize it so that it can be signed after he returns to China next spring. Before Envoy Weili De returns to his country, all embassy affairs will be temporarily handled by the newly appointed Counselor, Mr. He Bernuo.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Corporation Determined to Complete Shanghai-Tacheng Air Route</h3>
<p>Flying to Dihua Tomorrow First</p>
<p>Regarding the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's increase in capital and regular flights to Dihua and Tacheng to complete the Eurasia air route, Mr. Zha Zhenhe, the company's secretary, told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the company's Eurasia air route will be restored, with Tacheng station as the boundary. The section of the air route from Shanghai to Tacheng will be completed by China, while the section from Tacheng to Berlin will be the responsibility of Germany. The route between Shanghai and Tacheng, passing through Dihua, has been intermittently open due to repeated wars. Now that the company has announced a slight cessation of the war in Xinjiang, it has decided to depart from Shanghai for Dihua at 8:00 am tomorrow (the 15th), arriving on the 18th as scheduled. This flight will not carry passengers because the line has been suspended for a long time, and there is a large backlog of mail in Lanzhou, and the company also has many machine parts to bring to Dihua. After the plane arrives in Xinjiang, it will stay for two days and then return to Shanghai. It has also been decided that after the next flight arrives in Dihua, it will extend the flight to Tacheng. If there are no changes in Xinjiang Province, the Shanghai-Tacheng section can be completed within the year.</p>
<p>Increase in Capital</p>
<p>As for the company's increase in capital, it has been approved by the Central Government. When the company was established, the original capital was set at 6 million Marks, which at the time was a very low gold price, equivalent to 3 million National Currency, of which 2 million was Chinese and 1 million was German. In recent years, the company has sought business development and increased the purchase of machinery, and has now used up more than 2 million Marks of capital. Due to the soaring gold price, the combined National Currency has reached 3 million Yuan, so it was decided to increase the capital by 2.1 million National Currency, totaling 5.1 million Yuan, of which China accounts for 3.4 million and Germany accounts for 1.7 million. This has already been decided.</p>
<h3>Italian Silk Survey Group Completes Investigation in Sichuan and Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Compile a Book Report</p>
<p>Dr. Belli Mari, an Italian silk expert, and seven of his colleagues, went to Sichuan to investigate the silk industry. They arrived safely in Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Lai, the secretary of the survey team, the soil in Sichuan is fertile, and the climate is mild, not inferior to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. In the future, there is bound to be an increase in silk production. The group spent a month in Sichuan, going to Chengdu, Chongqing, Leshan, and other silk-producing areas to conduct a detailed investigation. They will now compile a report based on their findings to provide reference for the industrial sector.</p>
<h3>Kim Seok's Family Representatives Send Telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for Assistance</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that Kim Seok was illegally arrested by the Japanese Consul, and his whereabouts have been unknown for ten days. In addition to exhausting their efforts to request assistance from various French groups in the port, the family representatives yesterday sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Commission, ordering serious negotiations. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Nanchang Chiang Kai-shek Junjian, it is found that Kim Seok was naturalized as a Chinese citizen on October 5th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, along with his father Kim Yong-taek (Cheol), and holds Naturalization Permit No. 67 issued by the Ministry of Interior of the National Government. Therefore, according to the law, he is a citizen of the Republic of China, and has lived in China for several years. He is currently still studying and has not participated in any movements. He only believes in the Three Principles of the People and joined the Chinese Kuomintang. Because of his efforts in revolutionary work, he and his father were illegally arrested by the Japanese Consul in November of last year. Fortunately, the municipal authorities, based on their naturalized citizenship, seriously negotiated, and they were released. However, at 6:00 pm on November 22nd of this year, he was again illegally arrested by the Japanese Consul in Shanghai in conjunction with the French police in the French Concession. The family representatives have repeatedly presented the nationality permit to the municipal government and the French Consul-General, requesting protests, but for more than ten days, his whereabouts have been unknown. This matter not only infringes on individual legal rights, but also greatly damages national sovereignty and tarnishes international prestige. We dare to ask the Chairman to uphold the revolutionary spirit, promptly order serious negotiations, and quickly release Kim Seok, in order to maintain national dignity and comfort the expectations of society. Respectfully presented, Kim Seok's family representatives Chen Yang, Li Shichang, lawyer Mei Yunmei, Xu Jie, Luo Zhaoxin, together bow their heads.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Responds to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Telegram, Endorsing Internal Stability and Resistance Against External Aggression</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously sent a clever telegram due to the ongoing foreign aggression and the sudden Minbian (Fujian Incident), advocating the determination of internal stability and external resistance, with the focus on not seeking temporary peace in one area, which would leave hidden worries for the overall situation, and internally, military and political personnel should do their best in their duties. After sending telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and the chairmen of various provinces, yesterday, a reply telegram was received from Zhang Qun, Chairman of Hubei Province, which said: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Jianjian, the clever telegram has been read, internal stability and resistance against external aggression, everyone has the same heart, exploring the root cause, I am happy to hear your grand theory, I respectfully listen to your enlightening words, and dare not fail to encourage each other, Zhang Qun bows his head.</p>
<h3>Li Shizeng Pleads for Relief from the Yellow River Disaster</h3>
<p>Li Shizeng sent a letter for the Hebei Province Yellow River levee, requesting the Central Government to quickly repair it, saying: Jingwei, Yongzhi, Junren, Gentlemen's honorary certificates, Respectfully I write, according to the representatives of the Yellow River disaster area in Hebei Province, Mr. Tian Jianai, Mr. Wang Fengduo, claiming to request two things as follows, one, repairing the dike, the cause of this Yellow River disaster is extremely serious, the old dike has already been silted up and flattened, shaped like no dike, the current work of the Huangzai Committee's work relief group is only engaged in blocking the mouth, for repairing the dike, because they have not received an order from the Central Government, there are no such funds, and no such preparations, but the dike repair and mouth blocking are equally important, if only blocking the mouth without repairing the dike, then once the Yellow River floods, it will inevitably flow horizontally and flood, so blocking the mouth and not blocking the mouth are the same, it is necessary to increase the mouth and repair the dike, both sides proceed at the same time, in order to receive the effect of blocking the mouth, two, raising funds, the Central Government already has dike mouth funds, and the required dike repair, the number is not many, but the Central Government must not be without this levy, what is a pity is that it was not carried out at the same time as mouth blocking, now is the time when the country has many disasters, and funds are urgently needed, in case the funds for dike repair cannot be raised, please the Central Government issue a clear order to the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, to work together and share the fundraising, the above is the representative's request, the so-called mouth blocking and dike repair are equally important, etc., quite concise, it seems that we should consider both, I think that the gentlemen have already considered this matter, Mr. Tian and Mr. Wang, this time to the south, intend to pay separate visits, still ask for your adoption and implementation, I am extremely grateful, I respectfully wish you peace.</p>

<h3>Employees of Two Railways Hold Meeting Yesterday to Condemn Rebellion and Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways held a meeting yesterday at 10:00 am at the North Station to condemn rebellion and suppress bandits. Approximately 3,000 people attended, including representatives from the two railways' Party Headquarters, Railway Bureau Trade Union, and various station offices and factories, all students from the Shanghai Wusong Rotary Elementary School, the North Station Stevedores' Children's Elementary School, the Maigen Road North Station Stevedores, dining staff, and guests.</p>
<p>The meeting staff included the presidium, Yuan Boyang, Sun Shaojie, Chen Chengshi, Zou Zhengjian, Li Dasan, Min Luobi, Chen Bohua, Xue Jie, recorders Liu Xiong, Huang Rui, master of ceremonies Zhang Yunhe, and inspectors Yang Youren, etc., and receptionists Tan Gengxin, etc.</p>
<p>Meeting Order (1) All stand at attention, (2) Sing the Party song, (3) Pay the highest respect to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Premier, (4) The Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will, (5) Silence, (6) Report, (7) Speech, (8) Proposal, (9) Shout slogans, (10) Adjourn the meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>First, Chairman Chen Chengshi respectfully read the Premier's will, and then reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Chairman Zou Zhengjian reported that China is currently being oppressed by foreign imperialism, and the reason is entirely caused by internal division. Because of division, there is no unity. Without unity, there is no power to resist foreign aggression. Recently, a group of bored warlords and politicians, etc., organized a so-called people's pseudo-government in Fujian, which overshadowed the Chinese nation and greatly affected the Chinese nation. This kind of rebellious behavior in the trash can is creating opportunities for imperialism. As for the communist bandits who are disturbing China, we hate them even more, destroying production and harming the people. If we examine the circumstances of the crimes committed by the communist bandits in the past, we should quickly eliminate them to preserve the Chinese state and seek the survival of the Chinese nation. Next, Min Luobi gave a speech, saying that the Communist Party is harmful to China, from the current Jiangxi and the previous riots, Zhan Tang Puleng knows that they are completely deceiving the people. When the violent Japanese occupied the Northeast, the Communist bandits restrained the Central Army from going north to resist Japan, so we believe that to seek a way out for China, we must eliminate the Communist bandits. The imperialism of various countries has been invading our country in recent years, which can be described as all-pervasive. We should unite sincerely, live, gather, and teach. Unexpectedly, recently a group of frustrated warlords and politicians in Fujian suddenly rebelled. This is no different from supporting the communist bandits and the violent Japanese. For the sake of saving China and the Chinese nation, we should eliminate the communist bandits and crusade against the rebels in order to seek national survival and the happiness of the people. Yuan Boyang gave a speech, explaining the crimes of the Communist Party and the mistakes of class struggle. The Fujian rebellion cannot be successful and is inevitable.</p>
<p>Telegram Text (1) Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Executive Yuan, Military Commission, Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters, Provincial and Municipal Governments, Railway Colleagues, People's Organizations, Party and the country are unfortunate, and turmoil is frequent. Externally, the strong neighbors are rampant, the Northeast is devastated, internally, the communist bandits are rampant, and the red disaster is rampant. The national situation is as dangerous as eggs piled up, and the lives of the people are more difficult than upside down. All our compatriots across the country, at this time of national crisis, are all aware that the country will perish without delay, and all seek the way to unite with one heart and one mind and go to the national disaster together. However, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Chen Youren, and other rebels gathered all kinds of reactionary elements and dared to disregard the world's great opposition, occupied the Eight Mins, opened the government and dominated themselves, colluded with bandits and betrayed the country, and harmed the country. The news came and the pain was about to end. The Min rebels contacted the communist bandits, colluded with the violent Japanese, colluded together, and colluded with each other. It can be seen that the conspiracy behind the smoke is deep. If we do not quickly eliminate them at this time, not only will it be difficult to manage the spread, but it will inevitably lead to the crushing of the mainland and the division of Shenzhou. Alas, why are the rebels so frantic and violent? This is truly intolerable to the heavens and earth and abandoned by the people of the country. We should ask the Central Government to quickly move the army and severely crusade against them, and to quell the rebellion and stabilize the Party and the country. We hope that all compatriots across the country will support the Central Government, consolidate unity, take the overall plan of internal stability and resistance against external aggression, and encourage the common hatred of enemies. Unanimously condemn them and destroy them this morning, so as to save the fate of the country and maintain the survival of the nation. The telegram is extremely urgent and looking forward to it. Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Condemnation of Rebellion and Suppression of Bandits Conference. Qin, (1) Li Liejun Jian, since the Minbian, it has been two decades since Chen Li and the rebels had a conspiracy of rebellion before the event, and they have no intention of remorse after the event. Recently, they have intensified their efforts to openly betray the Party and the country, usurp the name and change the Yuan, collude with the Communist Party to surrender to the enemy, and internally work for tigers, burning the dying ashes of the red bandits, and externally opening the door to robbers, leaving the strong neighbors to invade, losing their minds and acting perversely. The rebel traces have been revealed, and the whole country is indignant. The gentleman is a member of the Central Committee, and should be in awe of the danger of eggs piled up and strive to support the ambition of rectification. For those rebels, how should they be accused and crusade against them? To be the advocate of the world, now do not plan for this, but still use the opening of political power as a slogan to solve the Min rebellion. Such an impact, not only authorized the rebels to arrogantly act, but also to give the stubborn an implicit hint to follow suit, confusing the audience, is by no means superficial. What is the sincerity of this? It is difficult to understand. Moreover, the Party's path to save the country has its own Party platform and policies to follow. The realization of democracy also has a fixed procedure, which cannot be achieved overnight, nor can it be achieved by empty words. Those who bear heavy responsibilities must work together with one heart and strive to promote the doctrine in order to complete the stage of political training. The gentleman is wise and can remember the reasons for the failure of the revolution in the early Republic of China. This association cherishes the reputation of the gentleman and cannot bear to sit back and watch the country's demise, so it specially offers loyal advice. Only the gentleman will understand it. Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Condemnation of Rebellion and Suppression of Red Propaganda Conference Seal, Yuan, (1) Nanchang Chiang Kai-shek Dongjian, and transferred to all the anti-bandit soldiers, since the September 18th Shenbian, the violent Japanese have been invading externally, and the communist bandits have been trampling internally. The Northeast is devastated, the rivers and mountains have changed color, and the national situation is in danger. Fortunately, Jun Zuo Ben's overall plan for internal stability and resistance against external aggression, tempering the determination to have enemies and no self, commanding all the soldiers, working hard to suppress the bandits, shedding blood on the battlefield, and trying to turn the tide. The command is as stable as Mount Tai, and good news is frequently spread. At this time, the period when the merger has become the imminent annihilation, Chen Li's rebels have even contacted the Communist Party and attached themselves to Japan, destroying the Party and betraying the country, and inciting rebellion in Fujian. The sadness of the heart is unmatched by this. I think that Jun Zuo is the pillar of the Party and the country, with high merit, and the great cause of the revolution is not the responsibility of ordinary people. I dare to ask you to strive harder and stabilize the chaos, strive for survival for the country, and leave righteousness for the world. The future of the Party and the country depends on it. This association hereby leads all colleagues to wholeheartedly support and send a special telegram of condolences. All dimensions are observed. Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Condemnation of Rebellion and Suppression of Red Propaganda Conference, Yuan, (1) Mr. Hu Zhantang of Hong Kong, Mr. Chen Bonan of Guangzhou, and transferred to the Cantonese and Guangxi Central Committee, the national disaster is in progress, the bandits have not been quelled, and the national foundation and people's livelihood are in danger. Since Chen Mingshu incited rebellion in Fujian, the national disaster has become more urgent. You and others bear heavy responsibilities and stand high in Guangdong and the South. At this time, the people are panicked and the central government lacks people to preside over the meeting. It is right to abandon prejudices and jointly assist in the national affairs. Unite sincerely. This road's colleagues, witnessing the difficulties of the times, the heart is in danger, and it is not allowed to be silent. Therefore, on the Yuan Day in Shanghai, we convened all the employees of the road and held a propaganda meeting to condemn rebellion and suppress the Red Army. We unanimously decided to send a telegram to all the gentlemen, ordering them to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Beijing on the deadline to jointly save the difficulties of the times. I cannot bear the extreme urgency.

<h3>Pudong Ronglin Wharf Worker's Dispute Over Unloading Cargo, Chunhe Wheel's Arrival Obstructed, Social Bureau Mediates</h3>
<p>A Peaceful Resolution May Be Achieved Today</p>
<p>Pudong Ronglin Wharf has been leased to Yuchang Coal Company, and the workers used are contracted by Yuchang's foreman Li Hongji. This year, the company took back the wharf from Yuchang Coal Company to operate it itself and entrusted the management to Hualun Foreign Company at 10 Guangdong Road. All dockworkers implemented the abolition of the contracting system and changed to bidding for employment. Li Hongji immediately expressed opposition and insisted that he continue to serve as foreman. Hualun told him that if he wanted to do it, he could also bid according to the regulations. Li did not bid. As a result of the bidding, Chen Tingzhang was selected. Unexpectedly, when Chen went to the wharf to take over the loading and unloading of workers, Li Hongji refused to give in, causing various disputes. Chen was afraid of causing unnecessary disputes, so he declared to Hualun Foreign Company that he would withdraw his bid and was unwilling to handle thorny affairs.</p>
<h3>Second Dispute</h3>
<p>After Chen withdrew his bid, Hualun again selected Shao Youxi, the second-place bidder, from the bidding. Li Hongji still expressed his opposition. After mediation from various parties, Shao Youxi voluntarily gave up, causing the wharf to be unable to operate. According to the person in charge of Ronglin Company and Hualun Foreign Company, the reporter said that foreman Li Hongji prevented others from taking over, making the wharf unable to start work, and the commercial ships that had been scheduled to unload have reached six ships one after another, resulting in a loss of more than 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Worker Agreement</h3>
<p>Four hundred workers have been out of work for more than two months due to this dispute. The livelihoods of the workers have been cut off and they cannot maintain their lives. Therefore, from all the workers, Qiu Antai and five others were publicly recommended to petition Ronglin Company on the 3rd of this month, requesting a quick start to work. The wharf authorities immediately signed an unloading agreement with all the workers in the name of representatives, abolishing the contracting system. When the agreement was signed, it was submitted to the Social Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and various Party and government agencies. It was decided that the official start date would be the 12th of this month. The first ship was the Chunhe Wheel of Hefeng Company to unload coal. Unexpectedly, the storm broke out again.</p>
<h3>Both Sides Compete</h3>
<p>The Chunhe entered port on the 12th. At 4:00 pm, the ship arrived at Ronglin Wharf. The cargo inside the ship was all coal. It was originally planned to open the cabin and unload the cargo at night. All the dockworkers had gathered and were ready to work. Unexpectedly, Li Hongji also led more than 100 workers to the wharf to seize the unloading of the cargo. The situation on both sides was dangerous. The wharf staff reported to the Public Security Bureau and the Security Team, and each dispatched a large team of soldiers and police to the wharf, deeply considering the possibility of a conflict. The Public Security Bureau police officers prohibited workers from both sides from opening the cabin to unload the cargo to avoid a bloody tragedy. Therefore, the Chunhe was blocked at the wharf and could not unload its cargo.</p>
<h3>Mediation in Progress</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Social Bureau convened representatives from both labor and capital to the bureau for mediation, intending to eliminate the dispute peacefully. Ronglin sent Mr. Lin to conduct negotiations. On one hand, the police and security team from the Third District Public Security Bureau were stationed at the wharf to prevent conflicts between the two sides. The morning negotiations did not yield any results. In the afternoon, representatives from the Social Bureau went to Ronglin Building and invited Li Hongji, Qiu Antai, and representatives from the capital side to reconcile again. At 6:00 pm, the consultations were still in progress. According to the person in charge of the capital side, it is generally expected that the matter can be resolved today.</p>
<h3>Crew Members Without Certificates Will Not Be Allowed to Serve</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications ordered the Navigation Administration to comply.</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reported that in order to ensure maritime safety, the Ministry of Communications specially formulated the Provisional Regulations for Crew Certification, stipulating that all Chinese and foreign crew members, whether or not they have already obtained officer certificates, should apply for certification within six months from the date of implementation of the regulations. The Ministry, considering that the deadline is approaching, specially issued a notice to the Navigation Administration yesterday that all crew members who have not obtained certificates, except for those who have applied for certification within the deadline but have not yet been issued, will be temporarily allowed to continue to serve as usual, and all others will be banned in order to emphasize the law.</p>
<h3>Marine Engineers' Association Petitions for the Banning of Unlicensed Marine Engineers, Requesting Implementation According to Regulations</h3>
<p>No Clearance Allowed for Unlicensed</p>
<p>The Chinese Marine Engineers' Union presented to the Ministry of Communications yesterday, saying, "Presenting to implement Article 1 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations for Crew Certification. According to the Shanghai Navigation Administration's Notice No. 62, and the Ministry's Order No. 2798, it is ordered to act. The Ministry has not been reported by the national flag shipping companies on the employment of crew members, so that until now, the number of crew members used on each ship, how many are national, and how many are foreign, cannot be verified. There are many obstacles to crew statistics. A detailed investigation should be carried out immediately for inspection. In addition, the crew certificate regulations stipulate that those who have not obtained certificates shall not serve as crew members. It is found that the crew members of each department obtain certificates after they are employed, or even have their applications rejected, but the shipping companies, for the sake of their lower salaries, still hire them and continue to serve. Such a view of navigation as a child's play should be resolutely banned to ensure safety. As for the crew members who have obtained certificates but are unemployed, it is unavoidable in fact. At this time of lack of navigators, if they are allowed to throw themselves away and be scattered, or even change careers, it is a pity, and the bureau should send letters to the local marine engineers' associations, drivers' associations, and unions to conduct detailed investigations in order to find ways to place them. In addition to separate orders, it is appropriate to issue the employment crew survey form and the unemployed crew survey form, each with one style, ordering the bureau to carefully investigate and fill in the report according to the above sections in order to make overall arrangements. In the future, when there is a request for employment or dismissal of crew members, it should also be reported at any time for verification. This order, etc., is ordered, except for foreign crew members who are investigated separately, it is appropriate to issue the employment crew survey form and the unemployed crew survey form, each with one style, requesting the association to carefully investigate and fill in the report according to the above sections and send it to the bureau for verification, hereby notified. Another order of the Ministry No. 5739, ordering the national crew members and foreign crew members serving on Chinese ships, who have not obtained certificates, must apply for certification to the Ministry before December 1st in order to comply with the law. The original volume is on file. It is considered that the Ministry has ordered that the deadline for crew members without certificates to apply for certification has expired, and in the usual bad habits, the general crew members without certificates only need to register with the Navigation Administration and pay the registration fee to be allowed to clear customs and serve. How is their experience, and whether they are suitable for certification, is not detailed. Such accumulated habits are no different from opening the door to convenience for those who have not obtained certificates to pass as qualified, while those who have obtained certificates and have nowhere to serve are illegally seized by the opportunistic. The result is that certification is used as a mere formality, and the Ministry's orders have no prestige. Even affecting the livelihood of a class of certified qualified crew members is by no means superficial. Therefore, the special report is submitted to the Ministry, allowing it to issue a general order to all subordinate agencies, and to comply with it uniformly. The previous orders must not allow any crew members without certificates to be allowed to clear customs by registration. It is a matter of traffic safety and the livelihood of crew members, and it should be approved for implementation. Respectfully presented, etc."</p>

<h3>Raw Silk Promotion to the US Not Easy: Quality, Cost, and Quantity Should Be Noted</h3>
<p>Industry Opinions Also Fail to Align. The silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have recently been declining due to a sharp decrease in foreign silk sales and high domestic costs. Industry associations of silk mills in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have repeatedly sent representatives to hold meetings in Shanghai, resolving not only to request the Economic Committee to quickly form a unified management committee, but also to discuss and resolve to organize a Raw Silk Promotion Association to the United States. Regarding this matter, there have been various rumors from the outside world. A reporter from the Industrial Society visited Mr. Miao Zhongxiu at the Bureau of Inspection yesterday, and the details of the discussion are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Postponement</h3>
<p>According to him, everyone agrees in principle to promoting raw silk abroad, but how to do it effectively requires careful study. When I first returned from the United States, I advocated establishing a large-scale promotion agency to support the export of raw silk. Later, considering the instability of the domestic political situation and the lack of resources in the silk industry itself, this matter was put aside. Recent reports stating that I have reached agreements with all parties are completely inaccurate. Personally, I believe that the United States has as many as 90,000 bales of silk in stock, while the monthly sales volume is only 30,000 bales, making promotion not easy. Moreover, the cost of domestic silk is too high, and without special assistance, it is impossible to export Chinese silk. Poor quality and lack of available goods are also reasons for the sluggish sales of Chinese silk. Therefore, while promotion is important, attention should also be paid to quality, cost, and quantity, along with various conveniences in promotion, to achieve results.</p>
<h3>Difficult Facts</h3>
<p>Furthermore, according to the reporter's investigation, the reason why it is difficult to establish a raw silk promotion association is the inability of the silk mill industry to unite. There are approximately 200 silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the strength of each factory varies, as does the quality of their products. Although the impact is similar under the current extreme decline of the silk industry, large factories with strong capital and resources have already planned for exports. The difficulty lies only with the general small and medium-sized manufacturers, who still have to rely on others for promotion. The different circumstances of each factory lead to differing opinions on this matter. However, the large factories are still a minority, so the industry associations of silk mills in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are still actively proceeding to protect the interests of the majority. As for the so-called imminent establishment of the association, that remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau: Notice Urging Collection of Land Ownership Certificates</h3>
<p>Since the Land Bureau completed the issuance of land ownership certificates in the Shanghai South Caojing District, and started exchanging them in the Yangjing, Fahua, and Zhabei Districts, many people who have had their land ownership certificates drawn have not come to the bureau to collect them. This concerns the property rights of the people, and the bureau has been carefully keeping them on their behalf. It is heard that the bureau, considering the increasing number of land ownership certificates that have been prepared, finds it inconvenient to keep them permanently. It has been decided that starting from today, the names of the owners who have not collected their certificates will be published in the newspapers daily. The owners are requested to read the advertisements and, within three months, bring the old single receipt issued by the bureau at the time of exchanging the land ownership certificates to the bureau for collection. If they are not collected within the deadline, a storage fee will be charged.</p>

<h3>Shandong: Yellow River Flood, Counties Completely Submerged</h3>
<p>Three Counties Open Soup Kitchens, Serving Over 7,000 People. Yesterday, the Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee received a report from Director Du Yannian of the Shandong Investigation and Relief Office, who inspected the disaster area. The report stated that the Dongping Anshan Town soup kitchen was established on the first of this month and began serving porridge, with over 3,000 disaster-stricken people receiving porridge. However, villagers from various villages all arrived by boat to receive porridge, making transportation quite inconvenient. For convenience, the local authorities requested that rice be distributed once every few days to avoid the difficulties of boat travel for the disaster victims. The director has ordered the head of the soup kitchen to handle this appropriately. The director then went to Shouzhang and Yanggu to inspect the soup kitchens in those counties, both of which were established on November 6th and began serving porridge. The Shouzhang soup kitchen served over 2,400 disaster-stricken people, and the Yanggu soup kitchen served over 2,000 people. The disaster areas in both counties are still completely submerged, and travel to the disaster areas for investigation and relief still requires boats.</p>
<h3>Two Railways: Vehicle Safety Committee Held Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussed Six Proposals. The Vehicle Safety Committee, organized by the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations under the order of the Ministry of Railways, has been established and held its first meeting in the conference room of the bureau at 10 a.m. yesterday. Attendees included Director Huang Boqiao, Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng, and 13 heads of departments. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Director's Speech. After the customary greetings, Director Huang Boqiao delivered a speech, the gist of which was that in the past 11 months, according to reports from the traffic and police departments, there have been problems with traffic safety from time to time, and the number of casualties is alarming. Although most accidents are due to the public's carelessness in avoiding traffic, from the perspective of the railway, it is felt that efforts have not been fully exerted. Therefore, how to enable close communication between car workers, mechanics, police, and various departments to gradually reduce traffic accidents is an urgent task. The purpose of establishing this committee is precisely for this. To complete this mission in the future, based on personal observations, three conditions should be strictly noted: the first is to improve equipment, the second is to improve methods, and the third is to pay attention to employee training. Among these three items, employee training is the most important, because if personnel do not perform well, even if the equipment is good and the methods are excellent, not only will they not be able to be used, but they may even cause obstacles. As for how the committee's work should be implemented, I also have three points of view: (1) to examine the various statistics of past accidents, (2) to examine the causes of past accidents, the handling process, and the effectiveness of the experience, and (3) to examine the handling methods of advanced countries and other domestic railways. Just as a doctor treats a disease, he must first find out the cause, verify it with theory, and refer to experience. After detailed research, he can then determine the prescription. The mission of this committee is roughly the same. You all have a very long history of service on this railway and are very experienced. I hope you will all share your insights and jointly determine the strategy so that this railway can achieve the three major goals of safety, speed, and economy to promote business.</p>
<p>Origin of the Committee. Deputy Director Wu then reported on the origin of the committee, the gist of which was that the organization of the Vehicle Safety Committee did not start today. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, this road already had a similar gathering, but the meeting was presided over by the foreign supervisor, and the committee members were senior personnel from the traffic department. A meeting was held once a month to discuss and resolve several safety-related proposals, which were communicated to the relevant departments for compliance. Later, since the engineering and mechanical departments were closely related, they joined one after another. In the 18th year, this road was reorganized, and the committee was suspended. In August last year, the Ministry of Railways issued a translated book on vehicle safety and ordered all roads to organize safety committees. It was handed over to the traffic, engineering, and mechanical departments for review. In June this year, the Ministry of Railways reiterated the previous order, urging prompt formation and issuing the regulations set by the Jinpu Railway for reference. The Bureau, after detailed review by the traffic and mechanical departments, finalized the vehicle safety committee regulations of this road, which were passed at the 26th Bureau Affairs Meeting and submitted to the Ministry for record. At the same time, according to the quota stipulated in the regulations, personnel were assigned to organize it. Subsequently, due to participation in the opening ceremony of the ferry and other matters, all departments were extremely busy, so it was delayed until today to be established. This is the organizational process of this committee. As for how to proceed in the future, as I see it, traffic safety is extremely important to the finances and business of this road. Traffic accidents not only cause property losses, but also endanger lives, which is contrary to the purpose of protection. Foreign railways often display safety-related signs in various places, paying serious attention to this safety issue. It is important to know that prevention is paramount in everything. Rather than trying to remedy the situation after an accident, it is better to prevent it from happening from the root or reduce the chance of it happening to the lowest possible level. This is the mission of this committee. As for how to do it, Director Huang has given detailed instructions. In terms of equipment, such as signals, tracks, and fire-fighting equipment, the latest and best things are adopted. In terms of methods, although they are very well-defined, what good is it if the personnel lack training? You representatives of various departments are directly and indirectly responsible for guidance. In addition to carefully inspecting and improving equipment and methods, you must also carefully study the traffic regulations, compile them into simple and easy-to-understand texts, distribute them to employees for reading, and hold public lectures and examinations at any time to see if they understand and abide by them, to gradually achieve the purpose of safety.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: (1) Request to transfer track inspection workers to the jurisdiction of the police station, adding armed police escorts every night for patrols to ensure safety. (2) Proposal to prohibit locomotives from cleaning furnaces halfway or in inappropriate sections to avoid accidents. (3) Proposal to request drivers in the mechanical department to pay attention to the signals given by the flag-waving workers to ensure safety. (4) Proposal to request drivers to pay attention to the maximum speed when trains pass through curved sections, not to exceed 40 miles per hour, to avoid causing accidents easily. (5) The current traffic speed often exceeds 40 kilometers per hour when passing through non-stop stations and facing track removal. Effective restrictions should be added to ensure safety. (6) How to remedy traffic accidents caused by negligence of switchmen.</p>
<h3>Reconstructing Nanxingqiao Station</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau has ordered the Engineering Department to follow suit. Nanxingqiao Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou West Railway has become increasingly important since it started joint transportation with the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. The original buildings are simple and small and not suitable for use. The Traffic Department previously submitted a reconstruction plan, and the Railway Bureau designated Chief Pu Dengqing of the Engineering Department, along with Deputy Chief Yuan Shaochang and Secretary Xiao Weiguo of the Traffic Department, to go to the station for on-site inspection. According to the report, the station's business is booming and it should be expanded to benefit travelers. However, the existing buildings have not been fully utilized, and the allocation of employee housing and offices has not been properly handled. After consultation with the traffic section chief and engineer, the reconstruction principles were determined to be (1) fully utilize existing equipment, (2) employee housing should be separated from offices, and (3) reduce construction costs to a minimum. The originally proposed plan will be revised accordingly, which can reduce the construction of two rooms and save about 1,000 yuan. For the platform canopy, the Engineering Department will also use the simplest method for construction or implement it in stages to alleviate the burden on the railway treasury. It was also found that the station only has three lines, and a turnout line should be added to facilitate vehicle delivery, which is also urgent. After receiving the report, the Railway Bureau has ordered the Engineering Department to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Special Zone National Products Movement Congress: Opening Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Opening at Guanghua Grand Theater at 10 a.m. Temporary Market Opens in the Afternoon, Welcome to Visit. The Shanghai Special Zone National Products Movement Congress, organized by the United Association of Chinese National Factories, has been largely prepared since the organizing committee began active preparations. It is now approved to open at 10 a.m. tomorrow (the 15th), with the opening ceremony to be held at the Guanghua Grand Theater. The ceremony will be grand, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director Wu Xingya, Party Committee members Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Tong Xingbai, Tao Baichuan, Chairman of the National Business Federation Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai, and others will be invited to hold the unveiling ceremony. The temporary market attached to the Congress is being actively arranged. Factories are competing to show off their best products, transporting exquisite products for display to win the praise of the community. It is heard that the opening hours of the temporary market are set for 2 p.m. tomorrow. The Congress has already sent out hundreds of invitations yesterday, inviting party and government agencies and various organizations to participate in the opening ceremony. At that time, there will be heavy traffic, and Edward Road will be very crowded.</p>
<h3>National Products Promotion Association: Sponsors Changzhou National Products Market</h3>
<p>Soliciting Members' Products. The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association believes that Mr. He Xiaohu and others in Changzhou are enthusiastically promoting national products and establishing a national products market. The Association sent Commissioner Chen Binghui to inspect and found it satisfactory, and should give full support. As a preliminary plan to realize the promotion of national products to the countryside, the market fee originally set by the market will be reduced by three-tenths, and various guarantees will be required. In recent days, General Manager Xu Qiaoqi has been designing everything, and the progress is extremely busy. Yesterday, a notice was issued to all national product factories in Shanghai to solicit participation. The circular is recorded below. As for the notice, Mr. He Xiaohu, Mr. Wang Haibei, and other gentlemen in Changzhou, in order to develop the sales of national products and concentrate the power to save the country, have raised funds to establish the Changzhou China National Products Market. They have newly built a three-story steel-framed concrete building inside Zhongshanmen as a market. They have sent a letter to this Association requesting assistance in soliciting the participation of various factories to facilitate the process. Later, as the market plans to open on January 1, 1934, during the winter season, Commissioner Chen Binghui and General Manager Xu Qiaoqi went to Changzhou for inspection. They found that the market was tightly organized and magnificently built. The location is commercially prosperous and densely populated, and the future development is promising. This Association has always been responsible for promoting national products and expanding the products of its members. Now that the opportunity is rare, we should assist and make a great contribution and see it succeed. Therefore, we are sending a copy of the market regulations and drawings, and we hope that your members will participate enthusiastically to facilitate promotion. We also hope that you will send personnel to the Association or the Jinhua Company on Wuma Road to fill out the registration form. There are not many market stalls, so please do not delay.</p>
<h3>Two Railways Transfer Section Chief: Employees Request Reversal of Order</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhiyün, the chief of the accounting section of the Materials Department of the Two Railways Administration, has held the position for many years. Recently, due to a change in the director of the department, he was suddenly transferred. The employees in the Wusong factory of the department believe that the transfer by the authorities was inappropriate. They specially prepared a document and presented it to the Wusong Machine Factory Branch Office Staff Association to forward it to the Two Railways Special Party Department and the Trade Union Council, requesting the Railway Bureau to reverse the order. The original submission is recorded as follows. Submitting a request for fairness, it is reported by the Sixth Branch. The Sixth Branch submits a request. Chief Zhang Zhiyün of the Accounting Section of the Materials Department has been serving in the bureau for 28 years. He has been promoted to section chief for three and a half years. During this period, there have been five changes of director, but Zhang has specialized knowledge and rich experience, and has been valued by the previous authorities, without being affected or changed. He has always been in harmony with all employees and is deeply loved. Recently, Director Sun Xuexiu of the Materials Department was transferred to the Ministry, and the authorities reassigned Mo Heng, the director of the General Affairs Department of the Bureau, to concurrently serve as director. At the beginning of Mo's tenure, he suddenly transferred Zhang to work in the Bureau's Secretariat. Upon hearing the news, the members of this branch were deeply shocked and surprised. It is believed that making the best use of people's talents is the earliest state governance proposition of President Sun. Since the establishment of the National Government, there have been examinations and screenings for civil servants, all in order to seek useful talents for the country. Zhang Zhiyün's knowledge, experience, and years of service are sufficient to prove that he is competent for his position. Director Huang has been in office for almost a year, and he has not expressed any dissatisfaction. It is not clear whether the main reason for the sudden transfer this time is to arrange for private individuals, but for the sake of national talent and railway business, a good talent with many years of experience should not be made to feel uneasy in his position. All members of this branch believe that this measure by the authorities is inappropriate and will make employees who are loyal to the Railway Bureau feel discouraged. The future of the Two Railways is unthinkable. It should be requested to reverse the order to appease the public. Therefore, we sincerely request you to forward the report to the Party Department and the Trade Union Council, requesting the Railway Bureau to correct it, which is in the public interest. According to this, it is found that the railway battles have their own specialties, and those who are not rich in knowledge and experience cannot take on the responsibility. Zhang is capable in handling affairs and is law-abiding, which is well-known to colleagues in the Wusong factory. According to the previous situation, we hereby submit a request to your association to approve the forwarding of the report to the Railway Bureau to reverse the order to appease the public.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Convenes Second Industrial Research Meeting</h3>
<p>Drafting Regulations for Industrial Production Control. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened the second Industrial Research Committee meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday. The following items were discussed: (1) The authorities of the Chinese and foreign concessions in this city are both about to implement inspections of factories. In order to facilitate manufacturers, this Association should request to send personnel to participate in the joint inspection. Approved by resolution, to be submitted to the Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government. (2) Investigate the raw materials used by various factories in this city, which are most needed, and encourage merchants to raise funds to start businesses to plug leaks and avoid relying on foreigners. Approved by resolution, to be reviewed after the Association completes the investigation and statistics. (3) The Pacific situation is urgent and becoming increasingly dangerous. For the sake of legitimate defense, if war breaks out, we must follow the example of the European War and convert various factories for military use. Although this Association is not responsible for it, it should conduct preliminary research, investigate how many factories and how many machines in the country can be used for military conversion in wartime, in order to assist the government in resisting strong enemies. Approved by resolution, to be sent to the Technical Cooperation Association for research and feedback. (4) The output of various industries is excessive, and price competition is becoming increasingly fierce. The future of industry is worrying. The government should be requested to quickly formulate regulations to limit production in order to provide relief. Approved by resolution, to first draft industrial production control regulations by this Association. Hu Xiyuan, Zheng Chengqing, Chen Xiaodie, Yang Qingqin, and Jin Runxiang were elected as drafting committee members, with Zheng Chengqing as the convener, and a meeting will be convened within the next few days to draft them.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Orders Municipal Government to Quickly Handle Official Purchase of Grain</h3>
<p>Limited to One Week After Receiving the Document to Prepare for Establishment. The Shanghai Municipal Government received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday. Previously, a telegram was received from Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission, stating that the provinces have had good harvests in recent years, coupled with the influx of foreign rice into the market, causing the sales of domestic rice to stagnate and prices to fall sharply. In order to alleviate the farmers' economy, please instruct the provinces and cities to organize official purchases of grain. This has been duly transferred for compliance. Now that winter is approaching, the weather is getting colder, and farmers are in urgent need of funds to purchase seeds, official purchases of grain should be carried out as soon as possible to provide relief. Therefore, special orders are issued to the provinces and cities, and the Municipal Government is ordered to prepare for establishment within one week of receiving the document.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office to Close Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲ The Ministry of Industry Will Establish a Fisheries Protection Office in Shanghai. The Jiangzhe Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office will be closed tomorrow (the 15th). However, the salaries of the staff of the 11 collection offices in Shanghai, Tai, and Su are in arrears for eight months and have not been paid. Therefore, the expenditure account books have not been submitted to the Ministry. The Ministry has decided to clear and issue them after they are reported. Furthermore, the Ministry has established a Fisheries Protection Office in Shanghai to take charge of the fisheries after the管理局 is abolished. All six patrol ships, including Haihong, from the former Jiangzhe, Jilu, and Minyue districts, will be commanded by the Fisheries Protection Office and patrol the original sea areas of the three districts. The director will be Yuan Lianghua, the former director of the Jiangzhe district. It is expected to be established within this year.</p>
<h3>Local Wine Affixed with Sufficient Tax Certificate to Be Released Immediately</h3>
<p>No Measurement or Estimation Allowed. Although there has been much opposition from various parties after the Ministry of Finance increased the tax rate on local wine, the Ministry authorities, in order to maintain government orders and credibility, have not easily changed it. Recently, according to reports from various tax collection agencies, the procedures for inspecting local wine are slow, and measurement and estimation are still used, which is inconsistent with the new tax rate procedures. The Ministry of Finance specially ordered the local stamp, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus to comply. In the future, local wine that is taxed according to regulations and affixed with a sufficient tax certificate should be released immediately without delay, and measurement and estimation should not be used, so as not to make excuses and increase the tax burden.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Re-Requests Exemption of Supplemental Tax on Stored Wine</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Sauce and Wine Industry Association yesterday and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again, requesting approval to exempt stored wine from the supplemental tax. The original telegram is recorded below. To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on the 10th of this month, the Shanghai Sauce and Wine Industry Association submitted a report stating the reasons for the obstacles to tax refunds and supplemental taxes and requesting that the Ministry of Finance be ordered to postpone the matter in order to avoid disputes. (Omission) It is found that the sauce and wine industry specializes in retail sales and does not engage in wholesale transportation. Even if there are occasional sales of one or two jars, they are all genuine consumers who use them for festivals or celebrations every year and never transport them to other ports for business. Any wine, once it enters a sauce and wine store, is a raw material prepared for opening and mixing. The tax office only seeks to clear the boundaries to facilitate audit and does not intend to increase tax revenue. Therefore, it is clear that this stored wine is no longer reorganized and sold in the market but is prepared for opening and retail, and there is no confusion. There are about 3,000 large and small stores in Shanghai, scattered throughout the city, making investigation extremely difficult. Moreover, their daily opening and closing are difficult to accurately determine. Furthermore, the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau's No. 135 approval, the Shanghai Ningbo Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Joint Association, Item A, the last paragraph of the special tobacco leaf tax section states that a cigarette shop that purchases old tax tobacco leaves to make cigarettes and does not sell the tobacco leaves has already been ordered to be exempted from the special tax. It can be handled by analogy, and the matter is an example, and it is difficult to be biased and unfair. According to the exemption from the supplemental tax for cigarette shops that do not sell tobacco leaves, why should sauce and wine shops that do not sell whole jars still be subject to the supplemental tax? There may be unfair handling. It was ordered that a general meeting of members be convened on December 3. Regarding the issue of supplemental tax on stored wine, the public sentiment was extremely agitated. They only repeatedly persuaded to wait quietly for a solution and finally passed four motions: (1) Request to modify the fixed amount tax on local wine to facilitate procedures, (2) Unanimously deny tax refunds and supplemental taxes on inventory, (3) Demand the replacement of the tax magistrate, (4) If the goal cannot be achieved, we are willing to suspend business unanimously. For this reason, the obstacles to the supplemental tax are truthfully stated, and we hope that the Ministry of Finance will approve the request, exempt the supplemental tax, and order the release of the detained wine for gradual processing to comply with public opinion and avoid disputes. Based on this, regarding the request to exempt tax refunds and supplemental taxes on stored wine that has already paid the public sales fee, the reply was telegraphed by the association and approved by the Ministry of Finance with the tax number 151, and the Sauce and Wine Industry Association was ordered to comply. Now, it is continued that the wine sold in the sauce and wine stores in this city is often opened for retail sales and never wholesaled to other ports. It is in the scope of exemption from the Ministry approval, especially if the cigarette shops that store tobacco and produce shredded tobacco are ordered to be exempted from the special tax, it should not show prosperity and decline. As for the so-called difficulty in checking and reporting the daily opening and dismantling of stored wine in sauce and wine stores, it also shows the reality. The association is the mouthpiece of businessmen and should not suppress it from above. It is reasonable to submit a telegram on behalf of the association, and we hope that your department will review and approve it. Please order the Tax Bureau to return the wine that has been detained many times to show leniency.</p>
<h3>Water Fee Arbitration Council to Be Established; Real Estate Association Soliciting Opinions</h3>
<p>The general meeting will be convened tomorrow to discuss the issue of increased water fees after the British Shanghai Waterworks Company in the Public Concession implemented a self-reading water meter system. As disputes are escalating, the Real Estate Association has specially requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to organize a Water Fee Arbitration Council in order to easily resolve disputes between both parties. This has been approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors and will be formally established soon. To study and resolve difficult points, the Real Estate Association is separately soliciting opinions from various member owners in order to submit them to the council for research. A general meeting of members is scheduled to be held tomorrow (the 15th) afternoon. A notice was specially distributed yesterday, the original text of which reads: "To all concerned, the Water Fee Committee, after vigorous advocacy by this association, has been approved by the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council and will be established soon. This association should prepare early and have concrete opinions on water fees ready for submission. However, each landlord has experienced different difficulties. These opinions should be solicited separately. Please submit them to this association for research immediately. Furthermore, this association has scheduled a general meeting of members for 5 PM on December 15th (Friday) to discuss important issues. Please send a responsible representative to attend and jointly discuss solutions. Please do not neglect this matter." Respectfully, wishing you prosperity.</p>
<h3>Pudong Telephone; Transfer Method Being Negotiated</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company, as reported by the Ta Mei Wan Pao, stated today (the 13th) that the company's Pudong telephone service will not be terminated on Friday as reported, but will be replaced by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's service. The transfer of Pudong telephone services to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau will likely occur around February or March of next year. The company has not yet sent notices of service termination to its users. Although the Shanghai Telephone Bureau is currently installing telephones in Pudong, the connection of these telephones with the company's Pudong users is still being handled by the switchboard in the Nanshi Telephone Bureau. Reports in the local newspapers recently about the Shanghai Telephone Bureau taking back the company's Pudong telephone service are premature. The method of transfer is currently being negotiated, but it cannot be completed overnight.</p>
<h3>Xu Peihuang Discusses the Public Utilities Bureau Setting Up a Water Supply Office =Recovers Water Supply Rights for Xujiahui and Nanshi Ships= =Preparing for Pudong Waterworks and Public Buses=</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, yesterday afternoon to discuss various issues as follows:</p>
<p>Recovery of Water Supply Rights According to Mr. Xu, the water supply for ships in Xujiahui and Nanshi has long been handled by French merchants. The Chinese people have never paid attention to this, resulting in countless losses of rights. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau considered this a matter of sovereignty and repeatedly negotiated with the other party. Now, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has completely recovered the rights and is managing the business itself. Water and electricity supply are now provided by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. The bureau has also established a separate water supply office to handle these matters.</p>
<p>Pudong Waterworks He also mentioned that since the bureau connected the power lines to Pudong, the area has found it extremely convenient. However, the issue of water supply in Pudong also urgently needs to be addressed. The bureau is also planning to build water towers and install machinery and water pipes, with a budget of 300,000 yuan. The location has been decided at Lan Ni Du. The plan will be implemented first in densely populated areas to facilitate Pudong residents. However, due to the financial difficulties of the municipal treasury since January 28th Incident, it has not yet been realized. The city is now planning to explore other avenues, first consulting with enthusiastic individuals in Pudong, or through a government-business partnership, so that it can be realized soon. Once completed, it will be managed by the Water Supply Office.</p>
<p>Pudong Transportation As for transportation in Pudong, since the municipal government started operating the municipal ferry, travel has become more convenient and reliable. However, in order to promote the prosperity of Pudong, the municipal government also plans to open a ferry service to Dongjiadu. The Pudong Avenue is also being actively constructed by the Public Works Bureau and will be fully completed in a short period. Therefore, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is preparing to open public bus service on Pudong Avenue to further improve transportation in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Further News on the Collision of the Wanxiang Ship and the Lü’an Steamer; Sanbei Sends Personnel to Hankou to Investigate</h3>
<p>The Wanxiang steamer of the Sanbei Company, substituting for the scheduled service of the Fulong, collided with a small military transport steamer on the Yangtze River at Qizhou, upstream from Wuxue, resulting in over sixty deaths. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Further news is reported below:</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Accident</h3>
<p>The Wanxiang steamer was traveling upstream after unloading cargo in Jiujiang. When it reached downstream of Qizhou upstream of Wuxue (yesterday’s telegram mistakenly reported "Qizhou" as "Qizhou," it is actually "Qizhou") at night (4:20 AM, before dawn), the small military transport steamer, named Lü’an, was carrying over one hundred people from Hankou to Jiujiang. The two vessels collided. According to a follow-up telegram from the Wanxiang yesterday, the Lü’an small steamer did not have its lights on, making it difficult to see in the dark. When they were close to each other, it was too late to avoid the collision. The vessels collided violently, causing the small steamer to sink immediately. Because the ship was small and difficult to support, it broke upon impact and sank in an instant. It was truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Recovered Bodies</h3>
<p>After the Wanxiang caused the accident, it immediately stopped. All the crew members worked together to rescue those who fell into the river from the small steamer. Unfortunately, it was dark, making it difficult to distinguish anything. After one hour and forty minutes, they began to rescue some of those who had drowned. The telegram stated that over sixty people were recovered. A second telegram arrived yesterday afternoon, stating that after counting, a total of seventy people were rescued. At six o'clock in the morning, when the weather was slightly brighter, they began to recover bodies again. Five bodies were recovered from the river and taken to Hankou by the Wanxiang steamer. The search for other drowned persons is continuing.</p>
<h3>Wanxiang Remains in Hankou</h3>
<p>It is said that the two leading river navigators were on duty when the Wanxiang caused the accident. However, the shipowner cannot avoid responsibility. There was no detailed report on how the collision occurred yesterday. The Shanghai Bureau has sent an express airmail letter to inquire. If the Lü’an small steamer did not display lights or was sunk by the waves from the Wanxiang steamer because it was carrying too many people, then the responsibility of the duty officers of the Wanxiang cannot be reduced. The Wanxiang is currently staying in Hankou, awaiting investigation by personnel from both sides before sailing to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Fulong Steamer Substitutes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sanbei Company decided to temporarily assign the Fulong steamer to substitute for the Wanxiang's scheduled service. The Fulong was scheduled to depart from Hankou to Shanghai today, but unexpectedly, a telegram was received stating that the Fulong's shipowner, a Russian named Kao Fu, suddenly passed away due to illness. Fortunately, the Xingshi steamer had also arrived in Hankou. A telegram was sent to Shanghai to have the Xingshi's shipowner, Sha Yujia, replace the Fulong. A Westerner named Hao Fusheng was appointed as the new shipowner of the Xingshi. A telegram was sent to Hankou last night, ordering Sha Yujia to go to the Fulong steamer immediately to avoid delaying today's substitute service, so that passengers could transport goods as usual.</p>
<h3>Personnel Sent to Hankou</h3>
<p>It is said that although there were many deaths on the Lü’an small steamer, there were no other losses. After the incident occurred, the Shanghai Bureau immediately sent a telegram to the director of the Hankou Branch, Mr. Gao, yesterday to make initial contact. In addition, staff member Mr. Cao Yujia was dispatched to Hankou last night to thoroughly investigate the details of the case in order to resolve it as soon as possible. The exact number of deaths has not yet been officially reported.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Border and Northwest Exhibition Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>The Mongolian Border and Northwest Exhibition, which is about to depart to promote national crisis awareness in nineteen provinces, is closing soon and will set off for the Northwest, passing through the Southwest to promote national crisis awareness.

<p>Yesterday afternoon, a robbery occurred on Qiaodun Road in West Shanghai, in which bandits robbed a gold ring in broad daylight and shot and wounded the victim. One bandit was captured on the spot by the French police. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is further information obtained from the investigation: Cao, the wife of Zhang Youren, the local head of the 56th district of the 28th bao in Zuo Jia Zhai No. 2, South of the French Concession's Fa Hua Town, and her younger brother, Zhang Jingfu (18 years old), were working in the fields at around 2:50 PM the day before yesterday when they were suddenly robbed by two bandits riding bicycles. The bandits forcibly robbed a gold ring worn by Cao. Cao resisted to the death and shouted for help, which angered the bandits. The bandits raised a gun and shot Cao, and the bullet penetrated her left leg. Seeing that the situation was not good, the two bandits rode their bicycles away from Qiaodun Road towards the French Concession. Seeing his sister-in-law injured and falling to the ground, Jingfu chased after them relentlessly and fired a gun at them from behind, hitting Jingfu in the left shoulder. However, he continued to chase despite the pain. At the entrance of the Yueming Film Company on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, Zhang collapsed on the ground. At that time, police officers Zhang Weiqi and Ding Haishan of the Haig Road Outpost of the 2nd Precinct of the 6th District of the Shanghai Municipal Police, and Chinese police officer No. 598 of the French Concession police, all heard the commotion and arrived.

<h3>Public Buses to Start Operating Regularly in the City Center Area =Four Buses to Start First, Increasing to Twelve by the End of January= =Xu Peihuang Discusses Plans for a Circular Route in the City Center=</h3>
<p>Since the completion of the new municipal government building and the temporary offices of its affiliated bureaus in the city center area on the Double Ten Day, the municipal government has decided to gradually move files and stationery in from the 25th of this month, and the bureaus have also scheduled their relocation to officially begin operations on January 1, 1934. The transportation problem to and from the city center area has been actively prepared and implemented by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, and has been submitted to the municipal government for approval. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Public Buses After the municipal government instructed the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to actively prepare for transportation to the city center area, the bureau contacted the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company and approved the company's operating rights for public buses in the city center area. The company, in turn, decided to add twelve buses to operate the route from the North Station to Fuqian Road in the city center area, with designated stops. The company's factory immediately began manufacturing new vehicles, and stop signs were erected along the route, and fares were set for each stop. All preparations have now been completed and submitted to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for submission to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<p>Operating from the 20th After the company submitted its application to the municipal government for approval, it was decided to start operating from the 25th of this month, starting with four buses, to facilitate the movement of the municipal government and its affiliated agencies during the relocation period. At the same time, after the opening of the new municipal government building, many people from all walks of life visit it every Saturday or Sunday. Starting with the operation now will also facilitate the travel of visitors. The number of buses will be increased to eight from January 1st, and by the end of January, all twelve buses will be in operation, running back and forth every five minutes.</p>
<p>Stops Along the Route The stops along the route, starting from Baoshan Road, are: North Station, Baoxing Road, Tiantong'an, Law School, Patriotic Girls' School, Qujiaqiao, Hechang Oil Factory, Animal and Plant Company, Fudan University, Guoding Road, Songhu Road, First Park, Fuxi Neilu, Fuqian Road, etc., for a total of fourteen stops.</p>

<p>City Transportation According to Mr. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, once the straight-line transportation to the city center area is completed and the municipal government and various bureaus have officially moved in, and residential houses are gradually built, it will also be necessary to operate internal transportation in the city center area. The plan has already been drafted and will still be handled by the Zhabei Public Bus Company, operating public buses. The route will start from Xiangyin Road, pass through Huaping Road, Haihua Road, Fuqian Zuo Road, Fu Dongnan Road, Sanmin Road, to Guohe Road, and back to Xiangyin Road, circling the city center area in a circular route. On the one hand, it will still connect with the straight-line transportation. As for the problem of connecting the electric trams from Nanshi and Zhabei to the city center area, there have already been three meetings, and the draft plan will be completed soon. However, although there will be express trams, the funding will still require several million yuan, so the preparation time will need to be extended somewhat.</p>
<h3>Murdered Male Body Found in Yinghuali =Fingerprints Reveal Deceased Was Once Imprisoned= =Released Not Long Ago, Cause of Death Unknown=</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 PM the night before last, in the Chuhua Lane on Robison Road in West Shanghai, when residents were closing their doors and going to bed, three gunshots were suddenly heard at the entrance of the south end of the lane. At the time, residents believed it was late, the cold wind was biting, and the matter was not their concern, so they all ignored it and did not notice any incident. However, at around 6:00 AM yesterday, two Chinese patrol officers from the Putuo police station passed by the area and suddenly discovered a man, about 30 years old, wearing a blue serge camel's hair cotton-padded jacket, lying at the entrance of the lane. There were three gunshot wounds to his head, forming three large holes. Blood covered the ground, and he had been dead for a long time. The Chinese officers knew it was a murder case and quickly reported it to the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. At the same time, the incident alarmed nearby residents, who rushed to watch, but no one recognized the deceased. The detectives sent the body to the morgue for examination and took fingerprints to facilitate investigation. Shortly after, they discovered that the deceased's fingerprints had been taken for involvement in flower club (gang related) cases and that he had been released from prison in April of this year. The reason for his murder is currently being investigated by the police.</p>
<h3>The Arrest of Five Principal Culprits in the "Beat the Dog" Assassination Group, All Sentenced to Death = Prosecution by the Police Based on the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China = Sentence Announced Yesterday Morning, Culprits Taken Away by the Public Safety Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau's Supervisory Office previously arrested Cheng Xiangping, a key member of the Communist Party, in the Nanshi area. Cheng confessed to the existence of a secret organization called the "Beat the Dog" group, dedicated to assassinating political officials. Based on Cheng's confession, the Public Safety Bureau, in conjunction with detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station, apprehended group members Ou Zhiguang, Zhang Yushan, Yuan Youfang, Zhang Dexin, Dong Jiquan, and a woman named Chen Zhangshi at various locations, including Room 33 of the Zhongxing Hotel on Hankou Road, No. 40 Longmen Road, and No. 88 Zaide Lane on Chengdu Road. Seven pistols, four Mauser pistols, three gas pistols, two bombs, and over one thousand rounds of ammunition were seized. Investigations revealed that attacks on public officials such as Ma Shaowu (aka Lü Keqin), Huang Yonghua, Qian Yongqing, Zhou Ziyou, Wang Shouxi, He Jianqing, Wu Tian (aka Lei Dafu), as well as the murders of Cao Boqian, Hao Ming, Wu Xiu, and the serious injuries inflicted on Gu Minghui and Cao Zhangshi, were all committed by Ou and his accomplices. To avoid suspicion when carrying weapons, Chen Zhangshi was tasked with transporting firearms. Upon reaching the destination, she would distribute the weapons to Ou and others for the attacks. The police handed Ou and his accomplices over to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them under Article 286 of the Criminal Law and the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China. The Public Safety Bureau's legal advisor, Zhan Jifeng, requested their transfer, which was opposed by the defendants' lawyers. After legal arguments by Zhan, the court ruled that the transfer would be allowed after the police's case was judged. During the trial, Ou Zhiguang and the others readily admitted their crimes without showing any fear, thus negating the need for the police to present further evidence. The case was tried only three times, and the arguments were concluded on the 5th of this month. Yesterday morning, the sentence was announced. Police lawyer Li Zhishan and Public Safety Bureau legal advisor Zhan Jifeng, accompanied by several inspectors, were present in court. At 10 a.m., Criminal Court President Yu Hua, along with judges Jiang and Zhou, opened the First Criminal Court to announce the verdict. The main points of the verdict were: Ou Zhiguang, Zhang Yushan, Yuan Youfang, Zhang Dexin, and Dong Jiquan were each sentenced to ten years imprisonment for organizing a group with the aim of endangering the Republic of China. Ou Zhiguang, Yuan Youfang, and Zhang Dexin were each sentenced to death for repeated premeditated murder. Zhang Yushan and Dong Jiquan were each sentenced to death for being important accomplices in premeditated murder; each to be executed. Chen Zhangshi was sentenced to three years imprisonment for the joint crime of carrying military firearms and ammunition. The charge of organizing a group with the aim of endangering the Republic of China was dismissed. The seized military equipment was confiscated. After the verdict, Advisor Zhan immediately requested permission to transfer all defendants and firearms to the Public Safety Bureau, as the defendants were also involved in major cases in the interior. President Yu granted permission, and the Public Safety Bureau inspectors escorted the convicts away.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Plans to Establish Wireless Radio Stations in the Border Regions</h3>
<p>The Xinjiang and Mongolia regions of our country are located in remote border areas, vast in area, sparsely populated, with obstructed transportation, and delayed news. It is urgent to establish radio stations to strengthen national defense. A reporter learned yesterday that the Transportation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, recognizing this need, ordered a half-kilowatt high-power shortwave wireless radio from the Zhonghua Sanji Rui Electric Company on Avenue Joffre this summer, intending to use it for communications between Beijing and Xinjiang. To verify the machine's effectiveness, the company was instructed to test communications with radio stations in Java and Saigon. The results were excellent, so the decision was made to purchase it. Just as it was about to be packed for transport and installation, the second political upheaval in Xinjiang occurred, and the plan was suspended. Recently, the Ministry of Communications, noting that Xinjiang borders Russia and that commercial information is not flowing well, plans to establish powerful wireless radio stations in places like Yili to facilitate communication. It has requested the transfer of the machine from the Ministry of Military Affairs to ensure more reliable communication. It is reported that it will be shipped soon. Once installed, it will greatly benefit commerce and national defense in our country's border regions.</p>

<h3>Zhang Rongshang Has No Connection to the Clock Shop Robbery Case = Exoneration Through His Wife = Acquittal After Appeal</h3>
<p>On May 12th of this year, at 10 p.m., two armed robbers broke into the Daxing Clock Shop on Hubei Road, robbed clocks and watches, and fled. Detectives, upon hearing the alarm, pursued and captured one of the robbers, Lu Bingrong, and handed him over to the First Special District Court. Under interrogation, Lu confessed to conspiring with Li Desheng, who was still at large, to commit the robbery. Apart from Li, who remains to be apprehended, Lu has been sentenced by the court and imprisoned. On August 27th, the police received a report that Zhang Rongshang, a Ningbo native, was also one of the robbers in the case. Detectives apprehended Zhang in front of the Wing On Company. Zhang confessed to being a lookout during the robbery and even led the detectives to the Daxing Clock Shop to demonstrate the events of that night. The police then filed a lawsuit against him in the First Special Court. He confessed again in court, and at the conclusion of the preliminary trial, he was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment. However, his wife, Yu Xiuying, a young woman from Zhenhai residing at No. 6 Meiren Lane, Route Tenant de Vaux, French Concession, was deeply convinced that her husband's sentence was unjust and sought to exonerate him. She hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Court President Yu, along with Judges Zhao and Zhou, summoned witnesses and ordered that Lu Bingrong, the principal offender, be brought to face Zhang. Lu resolutely declared that he did not know Zhang Rongshang. After carefully examining the testimonies of all the witnesses, the court determined that Zhang Rongshang's confession during the preliminary trial was largely inconsistent with the facts, and Lu Bingrong had never implicated Zhang's name. Only after several months did an informant report that Zhang was privately hiding a pistol and that a search had failed to find it, and then claimed that he was involved in the robbery. The court found that the inconsistencies were obvious, and that the original judgment was not in accordance with the facts. The court recently announced its verdict, overturning the original judgment and acquitting Zhang Rongshang.</p>

<h3>Education News - Other Regions - Chiang Orders Hubei Provincial Authorities to Strictly Prevent Student Unrest - Those who incite students will be arrested by the military police. - Two universities stipulate three preventive measures.</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial Department of Education, Wuhan University, Zhonghua University, and the Garrison Headquarters recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, stating that since the Fujian Incident occurred, reactionary elements are lurking in cities, waiting for an opportunity to stir up trouble, using young students as tools to disrupt order by instigating student unrest, attempting to disrupt public security. They secretly go to various schools, distribute reactionary leaflets, and conspire to incite, harming the Party and the country and misleading young people. Their crimes are heinous and cannot be tolerated. Since Zhongzheng came to Hubei, he has taken extra care of young students. Regarding rectifying the academic atmosphere and promoting education, he has spared no effort in painstaking exhortations, which the students have all seen and heard. The students are deeply involved in their studies, and their thoughts are generally pure. External influences can easily lead to a momentary lapse in judgment, resulting in lifelong regret. Every time I think of this, I feel deeply saddened. In this time of national crisis, students in various schools should correct their direction, focus on their studies, as studying is the way to save the country, and distractions will only harm themselves. I cannot bear to see the country's useful young people swallow the bait and go astray. Therefore, I hereby declare restrictions and preventive measures in advance. The universities and the Department of Education have the responsibility to rectify the academic atmosphere. It is hoped that they will conduct preliminary investigations of the students in their respective schools, provide detailed admonitions, and if there are unscrupulous individuals who take the opportunity to infiltrate and spread rumors, the Garrison Commander and the heads of public security bureaus should be responsible for strictly investigating and arresting them at any time to avoid negligence and eliminate hidden dangers, etc. The Garrison Headquarters, aware of the unstable situation, has paid close attention to this matter and has dispatched officers to deeply investigate various schools, and has not slacked off at all. Wang Xinggong, President of Wuhan University, and Chen Shi, President of Zhonghua University, also stipulated three preventive measures yesterday: (1) Students are not allowed to take leave of absence without reason; (2) They are not allowed to participate in any illegal off-campus activities; (3) Student correspondence will be inspected to prevent problems before they arise, etc. (12th)</p>
<h3>Educational Instructions - Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau - Handling the Establishment of Private Schools</h3>
<p>▲Primary and secondary schools must not casually call themselves experimental schools. Night schools are prohibited from opening. The Ministry of Education, in response to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's request for instructions on handling the establishment of private schools, specifically instructed the bureau as follows: Acknowledged. After investigation, the Regulations for Private Schools have already been revised and promulgated by this Ministry. The previous points of inquiry from the bureau have generally been explained in the revised regulations. For the sake of clarity, specific instructions are hereby given item by item as follows:</p>
<p>(1) According to Article 11 of the Revised Regulations, except for the first board of directors, which is appointed by the founder, subsequent boards of directors should be elected by the board of directors themselves. The re-election method should be stipulated by each board of directors in its articles of association in accordance with Article 13 of the Revised Regulations.</p>
<p>(2) When the board of directors is suspended due to disputes, it should be reorganized in accordance with the provisions of Article 19, Section 2 of the Revised Regulations.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding debt matters, it should be handled in accordance with Article 24 of the Revised Regulations.</p>
<p>(4) The term of office of the directors should be stipulated by the board of directors in its articles of association, but the competent authority may order changes when the articles of association are submitted.</p>
<p>(5) The board of directors of a private school may add directors when necessary, but must be subject to the restrictions of Article 12 of the Revised Regulations and should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the appendix to Article 15 of the Revised Regulations.</p>
<p>(6) The words "Private" should be placed above the school name.</p>
<p>(7) It should be handled separately in accordance with Article 4 of the Elementary School Law, Article 4 of the Middle School Law, and Article 8 of the Vocational School Law. (The original inquiry asked whether the word "school" should be added below the school name. For example, in "Private XX Middle School," the word "school" can be omitted, but in "Private XX Normal School," the word "school" cannot be omitted. Therefore, is it necessary to add the word "school" to achieve uniformity?)</p>
<p>(8) Private primary and secondary schools must not casually call themselves experimental schools.</p>
<p>(9) It should be increased. (The original inquiry asked whether the regulations for private schools already stipulate the operating and recurring expenses in Article 26 of the Private School Regulations. However, the amount of the foundation, senior high school, and junior high school has not been specified. The bureau has historically required a foundation of 30,000 yuan for senior high schools and 15,000 yuan for junior high schools. Is this appropriate? Should the foundation be increased if a school has two or more departments?)</p>
<p>(10) It should be handled in accordance with this Ministry's Instruction No. 10223 of this year. (The original inquiry asked whether the Party Ideology in the newly promulgated curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools has been changed to Civics. Those who teach Civics do not seem to need to be certified, but should the Dean of Students be certified?)</p>
<p>(11) They should be ordered to stop enrolling students and handled in accordance with the repeated orders of this Ministry. (The original inquiry asked what to do with those who are hesitant to proceed in order and apply for establishment.)</p>
<p>(12) It should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 or 30 of the Revised Regulations. (Regarding school establishment, is it calculated from the date of approval by the educational administrative authority when the school was established, or from the date when the school started on its own, and then deducted for one full year before applying for school establishment?)</p>
<p>(13) Matters relating to changes in the school should be reported in accordance with the establishment procedures. (The original inquiry asked what is the correct procedure for a private junior high school that has been approved for establishment to add a senior high school or other normal school departments, or if it was originally only a senior high school and now needs to add other departments.)</p>
<p>(14) If the school administration has also been divided, it should be reported separately as two schools. (Some private schools have separate departments for boys and girls, and the school buildings, equipment, and teaching are all divided. In name, they originally belonged to one school, but in reality, they are two schools. What is the correct procedure for these schools to be reported as two schools?)</p>
<p>(15) Night schools should be prohibited from opening. (Five other items are omitted.)</p>

<h3>Film Advertising Must Also Be Inspected ▲Implementation in January Next Year</h3>
<p>The Film Inspection Committee, jointly formed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, discussed the method of inspecting films at its meeting on the 12th. It was generally agreed that foreign film inspections also include the inspection of film advertisements at the same time. After inspection, all the pictures and slogans used for a certain type of film should be used as advertisements in accordance with the approved pictures and words, and should not be exaggerated or exaggerated. This will allow the audience to know the actual situation of the film by seeing the advertisement, and can also avoid the malpractice of changing the appearance of films that have already been shown, cleverly creating new names, and deceiving for profit. However, our country does not inspect advertisements for films, which has led to malpractices. It was decided that starting from January next year, when film companies submit films for inspection, the Inspection Committee will also inspect the advertisements for the films. After the Inspection Committee has reviewed and approved the pictures and slogan advertisements to be used for each type of film, they shall not be changed, added to, or subtracted from to match the reality and avoid abuse.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the meeting believes that the previously stipulated film inspection law does not have clear provisions for inspecting educational films. In the future, when revising the inspection law, clauses will be added to facilitate the inspection of educational film methods to facilitate the process.</p>

<h3>Basketball Preliminary Results</h3>

After Taowu forward Zhao Huaguo scored, Chen Zheng'en and others scored six points in a row. Cuiying called a timeout to discuss strategy, but it was ineffective. Zhao Guohua's accurate shooting repeatedly made great contributions, reaching 16-0. Cuiying's Jiang Zujun scored two points, and Taowu's Zhou Bennie returned the favor. Cuiying's Ding Zhanxiong's long shot was successful. Taowu became more courageous as they fought, and Cuiying also showed slight improvement. The result of the first half was Taowu 40, Cuiying 12.

<h3>West Qing Women's Basketball: Southeast A Wins Against McLing ▲Southeast B Loses to Red Team by One Point ▲Liangjiang Wins Big Against Yellow Team 35-6 -Liangjiang to Meet Green Team Next Week-</h3>
<p>Last night's West Qing Women's Basketball match between Southeast B and the Red Team saw Southeast almost win, but unfortunately lost. The score was 22-23, a difference of only one point. Southeast took the lead in the first three quarters, but unexpectedly lost in the last one. The match between Southeast A and McLing was very intense. Both sides have long been famous, and the match was very tense. As a result, Southeast won 19-13. The match between Liangjiang and the Yellow Team was one-sided, with Liangjiang winning 35-6. The American Women's Team won big against the Telephone Team, and the Green Team defeated Junior. The results of the five groups are as follows:</p>

<p>Blue Team Wins Against Junior 7-11 15-13</p>
<p>The American Women's Team's victory over the Telephone Team was expected, but the American Women's Team's performance was far better than in previous matches. Only the defense was slightly weaker, the forwards were beautifully linked, and their shooting was very accurate. White was especially outstanding, making her a strong enemy of Liangjiang and Southeast.</p>
<p>▲Southeast A Wins Against McLing</p>
<p>The first match started at 6:30 PM between Southeast A and McLing. Both teams are known for their records, and the match was very intense. Southeast's Miss Ren Shu, petite and exquisite, repeatedly made great contributions, which allowed Southeast to gain the advantage. Although McLing opened the scoring, they ultimately lost 4-5 in the first quarter. Afterwards, Southeast's momentum gradually increased, and the officers' wives were busy defending, making the situation one-sided. However, Southeast's shooting was not very accurate, and they missed many opportunities. At the end of the first half, Southeast led 14-7. When the second half started, McLing boosted their spirits and worked hard, preventing Southeast from connecting their passes, and their formation suddenly scattered. At the end of the third quarter, the score was 16-11. In the last quarter, McLing's military might was even stronger, and they scored three points in a row in an instant, making the score 13-16. Southeast saw that the situation was not good, and persevered. Zou Shande resisted the enemy generals and defended the camp. Ren Shu scored a penalty kick, and Liao Zhuyuan added a goal. As a result, Southeast won 19-13.</p>

<p>▲Southeast B Suffers a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>The second match was between Southeast B and the well-known West Qing Red Team. Southeast B is a rising star, but unexpectedly, the Red Team was not easy to break through and was at a disadvantage. From the first quarter to the end of the third quarter, Southeast always took the lead, thinking that victory was in their hands. Unexpectedly, in the last quarter, Southeast's formation suddenly became chaotic and could not respond. Many balls fell into the hands of the enemy, and the opponent scored two goals in a row, taking the lead. Although Southeast tried hard to recover, they suffered a miserable defeat by a difference of one point. The score was 22-23. However, as a new army competing against the highly regarded West Qing Red Team, such a record is glorious even in defeat.</p>

The first quarter was 7-2, and the second quarter was 4-0, for a total of 11-2. After the break, the situation remained the same, and the situation was chaotic, with little interest. The Yellow Team had no shooting opportunities and only scored with free throws. At the end of the third quarter, Liangjiang had 19 points, and the Yellow Team had 6 points due to free throws.

<h3>Public Exhibition Cup Handball Tournament: Today's Championship is the Final Key ▲Third Round, Day Two: Chinese 3, Western 2 ▲Total Results for Two Days: Both Sides 5 Points Each</h3>
<p>-The Success or Failure of Today's Doubles Lies Here-</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the third round of the Public Exhibition Cup. The Chinese team, having suffered a one-point defeat the previous day, spared no effort to fight back. They were able to win 3-2, reversing the situation and bringing both sides to five points each, evenly matched. Therefore, the Chinese team has a better chance in today's doubles. The final success lies in this one effort. In yesterday's fourth group, Bu and Hua played first. Bu was experienced and shrewd, while Hua, though brave, could not be defeated. In the eighth group, Lu was at a disadvantage in the first game, resulting in defeat. In the second game, he worked hard and took the lead, but ultimately lost 18-21. In the tenth group, Sun fought hard against Heerden, winning two straight games with a score of 2-0, showing considerable skill. In the sixth group, Huang's battle was with Pierson. Huang's mind was quick and his shots were powerful, attacking the opponent's weakness, resulting in a very large surplus and winning two games in a row, allowing the Chinese and Western sides to each win two groups. In the end, the match between Hong and Roberts in the second group was of great importance to this championship. Because the results of the two days, before the start of that group's match, the Chinese team was still behind by one point. Ultimately, Hong's efforts resulted in a point, achieving a tie, which was very gratifying. At the beginning of the first game, Hong went straight ahead and won many points in a row, making it impossible for the strong enemy Roberts to counterattack. Therefore, he was able to win with a big score of 21-10. In the second game, Roberts was unwilling to show weakness. His shots and returns were greatly improved. The score was very close from beginning to end. Finally, both sides scored 22 points each. Fortunately, Hong was alert and killed two points in a row, ultimately winning the final victory, contributing greatly to the Chinese team. Today, a group photo will be taken at 6:00 PM.

<h3>Middle School Football Tournament: Pudong Wins 7-0 Against Chizhi</h3>
<p>Pudong Middle School has always strongly promoted sports, and has produced many talented people over the years, with a long-standing reputation. Since the school hired Xu Zheng, a Bachelor of Physical Education from National Central University, as the Director of Physical Education this semester, through gradual guidance, the results have improved even more. Xu is not only diligent in academic subjects and has extensive research, but also has talent in handling affairs. Therefore, in recent months, the school has been full of vitality and interest.</p>
<p>The school's football team participated in this year's Middle School Sports League Championship and has won many victories. Yesterday, they went to Jiangwan to compete against Chizhi Affiliated Middle School, with Chen Qingfeng as the referee. After the competition, the strength difference was obvious. In the first half, Pudong took the lead 1-0. After the change of sides, Pudong charged into the enemy lines as if there was no one there, scoring six goals in a row in one go, winning the game 7-0. Pudong's lineup was as follows: (1) Chen Minxiong, (2) Song Baogan, (3) Liu Zufeng, (4) Ding Xiangzhao, (5) Zhang Shi, (6) Song Zufeng, (7) Yao Zaizhong, (8) Zhou Jianxing, (9) Shi Xiaoquan and Li Jinji, (10) Li Muyao, (11) Li Senfa.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Race Club Billiards Tournament: Xu Shizhang Wins Group A Championship</h3>
<p>Lu Changhui in Group B and Zhu Jianzhang in Group C</p>
<p>Billiards is still not widely practiced in our country, but it is elegant and interesting, and it is popular in Europe and America. People enjoy it, just like football and basketball in our country. Since the completion of the new clubhouse of the Shanghai Race Club this spring, all the equipment has been carefully crafted. In particular, the two newly added pool tables are brand new and well-suited, and are very popular. This summer, a flat-force billiards competition was launched, which was very interesting. Now, a championship is being launched, which is even more exciting. As a result, Xu Shizhang, as expected, won the Group A championship. Wu Chengqi, the runner-up, was also quite strong. The winners of Group B and Group C are all rising stars.</p>
<p>Lu Changhui won the Group B championship, Fu Changnian was the runner-up, Zhu Jianzhang won the Group C championship, and Shen Gengxiang was the runner-up.</p>
<h3>The Xiangbin Cup Ping Pong Finals Face Obstacles</h3>
<p>▲Zexin Team Cannot Be Contacted</p>
<p>The 6th Xiang Cup Ping Pong Tournament organized by the Shanghai Race Club has been completed except for the finals between the Jiande and Zexin teams. The finals have been delayed because the officials of the cup competition were busy with official duties and could not organize it earlier, causing inconvenience to all parties, for which we apologize. It is now scheduled to be held at 8:00 PM on the 21st of this month (next Thursday) at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Tibet Road. Unexpectedly, when Daily News sent a letter to the Zexin team to inquire about their opinion, the original address of the team was tightly closed and could not be found, causing further difficulties. This notice is hereby published, hoping that the person in charge of the team will contact the association within the next two days to discuss everything so that a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Lingnan Sports Association Seeks Members</h3>
<p>The Lingnan Sports Association has been established for 18 years and has spared no effort in the study of sports. Now, in order to popularize sports, it is seeking members starting this month. In addition to the football team, it is also expanding the tennis team, baseball team, table tennis team, track and field team, and small ball team. They practice at the association's sports ground every Sunday, with the aim of completing a strong football team by next spring. Letters for friendly matches are also welcome. General Affairs: 1329 North Sichuan Road, 2nd Floor.</p>
<h3>Special Article: Progress of the Paris Chinese Painting Exhibition (7)</h3>
<p>▲ The World Illustrated Magazine (June 3rd) published an essay by Claron, which stated (Note: This year, when China held a painting exhibition at the Musée de Jeu de Paume in Paris in June, Japan also held a Japanese painting exhibition in the Galeries Georges Petit, competing with us. The title of this event was (Sino-Japanese War), which was humorous and very realistic.) (Excerpt omitted) Standing before Chinese art, viewers cannot help but feel reverence and admiration. The masterpieces of the Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties are, of course, impressive, but the brilliance of modern art is even more astonishing. Particularly noteworthy is the "Poetic Ideas of the Six Dynasties" by the renowned modern painter Xu Beihong, and Zhang Daqian's "Dongpo Figure," which depicts a solitary figure standing on a perilous rock, contemplating and gazing into the distance, surrounded by lonely pines, truly a fairyland. Furthermore, Zhang Yuguang's "Luck and Birds," with its insect-like red-beaked birds singing beneath a canopy of butterfly flowers, and its use of 운葉 (Yun leaves) as felt, is also exquisitely crafted. With each painting, one should strive to grasp the unique, un-Europeanized secrets of Chinese art. The true characteristic preserved by Chinese art is its ethereal spirituality and carefree thought. Here, in this almost Arabian style, in this gray or ochre hairnet style, amid all these minor artistic accidents, even a simple, about-to-bloom flower branch contains countless intentions, countless unspoken things, and what a shudder it sends through the soul. The artist's inscription and his flower-like brushstrokes seem to say to the viewer: "You continue from here, or you may end it yourself." (Rest omitted)</p>

<p>Winter Supplies Special Issue: A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>The National Products Exhibition of the Young Women's Christian Association Opens Today</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Promoting national products is a responsibility that women in the female community should bear more than men. Therefore, to promote national products and hope to achieve results, it is essential for women to come forward and vigorously advocate for them. The Year of National Products is about to conclude. In all fairness, although there has not been much success, the number of national product companies has increased; national products imitating foreign goods have surprisingly become readily available; and national product exhibitions and efforts to promote national products in various regions have been tireless. However, the sale of national products is still not smooth, factories still face difficulties, and the popularity of national products is still no match for the dumping of foreign goods, particularly those from Japan. In Shanghai alone, the consumption of foreign cosmetics in ten months has reached 1,398,864 yuan. When everyone does the math, it is truly alarming. It is clear that Shanghai is a major market for foreign goods, and those who contribute this huge sum are generally the wives, grandmothers, and young ladies. For the sake of beauty, they disregard the outflow of economic benefits; for the sake of being modern, they promote the sale of foreign goods; for the sake of looking good, they despise national products. Some say that the most degenerate and unaspiring is Shanghai society; sadly, those who degenerate this Shanghai society not only include the foreignized gentlemen who flatter madams, curry favor with wives, and bow down to petticoats, but also, without being polite, the majority of culprits are the wives, grandmothers, and young ladies, who cannot shirk their responsibility. Therefore, in this day and age, rather than advising men to promote national products, it is better to ask women to happily use them; rather than men shouting empty slogans, it is better to ask wives, grandmothers, and young ladies to vigorously advocate for them wholeheartedly. Let everyone make a resolution to use national products for everything from head to toe, from themselves to their families, including what they eat, use, wear, and live in. If there are no national products available, it is best not to use them at all. If it is absolutely necessary to use them, then be sure to conserve and find alternative items. From now on, the lifeline of our national products is in the hands of the wives, grandmothers, and young ladies. We rely on them to be guardians of the law, and we rely on them to lead and initiate. The National Products Exhibition of the Shanghai YWCA, thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of Mrs. Yu Yingjie and Mrs. Song Xingcun, who worked painstakingly to manage it, will open today at 8 Yuanmingyuan Road. The method of display breaks away from the previous flat, rigid, and lifeless approach, adopting a three-dimensional, flowing, and lively style. For example, model homes, children's clothing, women's clothing, and all the necessary household items, from bedrooms, studies, and living rooms to toilets and kitchens, are arranged in an extremely economical, aesthetically pleasing, and scientifically sound manner, truly opening a new era in national product exhibitions. At the end of the Year of National Products, this finale is worth everyone's attention and joy.</p>
<p>National Products Forum</p>
<h3>Women and Winter Supplies</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>The northwest wind is howling incessantly, various shops are booming, and the wives are even busier than usual. What are they busy with? They are busy shopping. What are they shopping for? Nothing but winter goods - winter supplies - so women and winter supplies have a close relationship. The day before yesterday, I went to my relative's house and met Mrs. Hu, who had just returned from shopping. She said that the Year of National Products really makes sense. I used to think that only foreigners could make good supplies, but now when I go to national product companies, everything is available, every style is complete. How can Chinese goods be inferior to foreign goods? I saw that she bought a large batch of goods, and when I checked them for her, they were all quite good. Later, I went to Mrs. Feng's house. This Mrs. Feng was questioning her daughter, saying that she should not have bought foreign goods. However, her daughter said that there were really no national products for this kind of item, so she went to buy foreign goods. After discussing it with her, I found that there were already national products that could replace this kind of supply, but everyone didn't know about it yet. Because of the daughter's temporary negligence, it provoked Mrs. Feng's anger. In fact, buying things is really a difficult task, especially for wives and young ladies who rarely go out. Of course they will be fooled, of course they will be confused. Moreover, as the Winter Solstice Festival approaches, the end of the year and the beginning of the year are busy with gift-giving, busy with festivals, busy with social engagements, and busy with handling household affairs. It is even easier to be negligent and deceived when shopping for supplies in the midst of this busyness. Therefore, I have three suggestions for the wives:</p>
<p>(1) Resolve to buy only national products for winter supplies. If you can't find national products, save if you can. Never be careless.</p>
<p>(2) Resolve to buy national products only from reputable national product companies. Do not be fooled by fake national products that are advertised dishonestly.</p>
<p>(3) Before going out to buy goods, first research what goods to buy at what place, and what brands to use for what goods. All of this should be prepared in advance, so as not to buy or mistakenly buy foreign goods or Japanese goods casually.</p>
<p>(4) Be very careful and wary of untruthful advertisements or slippery shop assistants who deceive people by passing off Japanese goods as national products.</p>
<p>National Product Talk</p>
<h3>Written to Urban Young Ladies</h3>
<p>— Xu Nanhong</p>
<p>The mercury in the thermometer has dropped to forty or fifty degrees, and the signs for winter sales are fluttering on both sides of the road, undoubtedly signaling the arrival of winter.</p>
<p>The withered leaves have been blown off the branches by the cold wind, and people have changed from light shirts to cotton-padded clothes. The young ladies in the city have to spend some effort to prepare their winter outfits for the year.</p>
<p>Undeniably, urban young ladies are the leaders of the women's community in the whole country. Their every move will affect the women in various parts of the interior. Haircuts and cheongsams were not enthusiastically promoted and spread to the interior due to the enthusiasm of the city? Therefore, they are the female models of the times.</p>
<p>This year is the Year of National Products. What kind of achievements have the young ladies made in promoting national products? This is really heartbreaking. Not only have they not made every effort to promote them, but they have also worked hard to promote the sale of foreign goods. Otherwise, the import of foreign cosmetics would not have reached such an alarming quantity.</p>
<p>Here, I sincerely hope that the young ladies in the city will go to the YWCA National Products Exhibition, and change their psychology of being obsessed with foreign goods to the front line of promoting national products, and create a national product winter outfit. Then, I believe that in the winter of next year, or perhaps in the near future, it will definitely become popular throughout the country, and you will not lose your position as leaders, and strive to be models for women of the times! Ladies, this is the time for you to add a different color to the Year of National Products with a great contribution.</p>
<h3>About Hot Water Bottles and Hand Warmers</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Of course, people's material enjoyment should progress, but living in backward China, they are fond of 20th-century consumption and waste, constantly causing the outflow of economic benefits. One day, when they are lamenting together and living as imprisoned slaves, it will be too late to enjoy national products! Therefore, no matter how simple or crude Chinese goods are, as Chinese people, we should use Chinese goods. This is a matter of course! Now, the senseless consumption of foreign goods by Chinese people is simply everyone seeking a dead end! This is especially regrettable in winter! Electric heaters, velvet pads, and hot water bottles are all foreign goods. Light and easy hot water bottles, one in the hands of every wife, grandmother, and young lady, although there are also national product hot water bottles made of non-national product raw materials, are used very little. Modern girls and modern women think that white copper hand warmers are clumsy and outdated! They disdain to touch them and despise them extremely! I think that delicate and small white copper hand warmers, if made with a soft flannel cover and filled with good charcoal briquettes, will stay warm much longer than hot water bottles, and can save the trouble of changing water and protect economic benefits. Why not do it?</p>
<p>National Product Discussion</p>
<h3>How to Purchase Winter Supplies?</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Alas, time flies so fast! In the blink of an eye, winter has arrived! In winter, our daily supplies are naturally more abundant and complex than in other seasons, and at the same time, economic expenditures will certainly increase accordingly. Therefore, we also need to pay attention to supplies in winter. Here, I will briefly describe what I can see, and I hope that experts will give me some advice.</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention to whether it is a national product - People say: (This year is the Year of National Products, everyone should use national products). This sentence is certainly correct, but I further say: (As a Chinese person, you should use national products, regardless of whether it is the Year of National Products or not. As long as I live day by day, standing under the Chinese sky and treading on Chinese land, everything must be national products. Therefore, in winter, when we purchase things, we must first pay attention to whether they are national products. If they are national products, we will buy them. If they are not national products, we will abandon them. Only in this way can we be a patriotic person who stands tall and firm.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to whether it is sturdy and durable - In recent years, most Chinese merchants have been short-sighted, and there are many who manufacture shoddy goods to deceive people. These merchants are the enemies of national products, and they are a great obstacle to the development of national products in the future. Therefore, when we buy winter supplies, we must buy sturdy and durable national products. As for whether the style is beautiful or not, it should be secondary. In this way, we should change the psychology of general merchants in making crude national products, and the output of national products can gradually become refined, and the overthrow of foreign goods will soon be a matter of time.</p>
<p>The above two items are what I personally feel. There are many other points to pay attention to, such as price, etc. For the sake of the valuable space of this publication, I will stop writing here.</p>
<h3>The Trademark of National Products</h3>
<p>— Hua Hua</p>
<p>It is certain that the first kind of product must have a trademark or explanation; therefore, if goods do not have a trademark, we have no way to distinguish whether they are national products, and we will certainly not buy them. There is another situation, that is, the trademarks and explanations of some national products are entirely in foreign languages. Is this appropriate?</p>
<p>A country has its own language, and like language, it can be said to be the soul of the country and nation. Then, the goods of the country should of course use their own language as trademarks and explanations; especially at present, most of our Chinese products are only sold domestically. Secondly, can compatriots recognize foreign words? The result of using foreign words entirely is probably not only without benefit, but will be hindered in sales, because the general public will recognize them as foreign goods and disdain to buy them. Merchants may have originally wanted to imitate foreign goods (what a sad psychology!), but our compatriots are not the same as before, and now they all know to love and use national products!</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that in the future, national product manufacturers will use our own language entirely on their products, whether it is the trademark or explanation, and write them as detailed as possible, so that our compatriots can see at a glance that they are national products and are happy to buy them. This matter is not troublesome for the manufacturers, there is no loss to the national products themselves, and it is very beneficial to the reputation of the country and sales. I think no one will say they are unwilling!</p>
<p>National Product Musings</p>
<h3>Modernity and National Products</h3>
<p>— You Ji</p>
<p>Most of the young men and women today are fascinated by the word "modern." You are modern, and I am modern. Therefore, everyone is competing for extravagance, and everyone is buying foreign goods. You wear a serge four-piece suit: I wear a flannel robe. National product face powder is rarely used by modern girls; therefore, cosmetics from various countries, such as 4711, are sold very well. As a result, the consumption of national products is declining day by day. Isn't that terrible?</p>
<p>I think that young men and women today may as well be modern. But there is no need to greatly promote foreign goods. Because "modern" is a transliteration of a Western word, and I replace it with 麼登 (me deng). Extending its meaning, it can be translated as fashionable, but being fashionable doesn't necessarily mean using foreign goods. Why can't national products be used? Because being fashionable means that the style is beautiful. How can it be that national products are necessarily not stylish?</p>
<p>Someone may say that foreign goods have fine quality and beautiful designs, which are in line with the ideas of modern youth. Good sales are certainly appropriate. I respond by saying that what you say is probably not wrong, but foreign goods are certainly more expensive than national products, and they are not necessarily durable. From an economic point of view, it is more appropriate to use national products. Moreover, if the people use national products, the country will benefit.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to say to the modern youth of today: Modernity means the present. Modernity is fine. But there is no need to greatly promote foreign goods. Moreover, using national products can save money for oneself and benefit the country, and national products are not necessarily not modern.</p>
<h3>Women and Imported Goods in Winter</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>In general, people say that foreign goods can sell well in China because women love to use foreign goods. Although we cannot solely blame women, men in suits and leather shoes also like to use foreign goods. But comparing the quality and quantity, women indeed use more foreign goods than men.</p>
<p>Especially in winter, women use even more foreign goods than in other seasons. Let's take a brief look. The white powder and red rouge they put on their faces are imported goods. The clothes they wear, not to mention the inside, the overcoat on the outside is made of foreign wool. Also, the embroidery thread that women use for handicrafts these days is all foreign goods!</p>
<p>Therefore, women use the most foreign goods in winter, and the sales of foreign goods in China may be the most developed. In the past, things like wool, flannel, and embroidery thread were indeed things that Chinese people could not make, but now, national product wool, national product flannel, and national product embroidery thread have appeared on the market one after another, but most Chinese women do not like to use those wool, flannel, and embroidery thread, and only want to buy foreign goods. Isn't that too foolish?</p>

<h3>Brushwood Cottage Jottings</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>We are sick men, we are a weak nation. Look at the foreigners, chests out and bellies protruding, how spirited! Looking back at ourselves, the men are hunchbacked and coughing constantly; the women are weak and frail, and seem to topple at the slightest breeze. Therefore, some people sigh and say: (The men are all Jia Baoyu, and the women are all Lin Daiyu. Giving them to me as food, how can the country not be treated as fish meat!</p>
<p>(The strength of foreign nations lies in their attention to hygiene. The weakness of our nation lies in our ignorance of hygiene). Everyone admits that these words are correct. However, I have some objections. Our people are not ignorant of hygiene, but they know it but cannot practice it. Therefore, year after year, they become sick men. If you don't believe me, I can cite a poem, which shows that Western hygienic theories of today were invented in our country several thousand years ago.</p>
<p>(In ancient times, a traveler on the road met three old men on the roadside, each over a hundred years old, weeding the fields together. The traveler stopped his carriage and asked the three old men, "How did you achieve this longevity?" The eldest old man stepped forward and said, "The old woman in my house is ugly." The middle old man stepped forward and said, "I limit what I eat according to my stomach." The youngest old man stepped forward and said, "I sleep at night without covering my head." These words of the three old men are essential for long life).</p>
<p>This is the "Poem of the Three Old Men" written by Ying Qu during the Three Kingdoms period. The main point of the poem is to advise people to have few desires and a clear mind; to advise people to moderate their diet; and to advise people to breathe fresh air. Isn't that a brand-new theory? I never thought that someone would have mentioned it thousands of years ago. I couldn't help but raise my thumb and praise: (Mr. Ying Xiulian - Ying Qu's courtesy name - was a great ancient hygienist!)</p>
<p>Food Miscellany</p>
<h3>Several Popular Winter Foods</h3>
<p>— Shan Xiu</p>
<p>Medicinal gelatin, bird's nest with ginseng and white fungus, these many bourgeois foods, I have only heard of their names. Not to mention that I have never eaten them, I have never even seen them. Therefore, I dare not rashly comment on the degree of their nourishment. However, I have heard old people say that these things, the poor cannot eat, and some people's constitutions cannot eat them either. Therefore, no matter how strong their nourishment is, they can only be tasted by a minority of the minority. Here, I will introduce several popular foods that are also suitable for the current season.</p>
<p>Soybean Milk: Whether in cities or villages, we can see rows of tofu shops. Every morning, for five or six copper coins, you can easily get a large cup of hot soybean milk. This thing enters the stomach, driving away the cold air completely; and, as everyone knows, it is rich in protein and vitamins, and its nourishment for the body is self-evident. If you make it yourself, it is also very convenient.</p>
<p>Eggs: The most common sideline for farmers is raising chickens. Therefore, the production of eggs is indeed a considerable source of income for farmers. I dare say that its effect is not inferior to ginseng from Wuwu Mountain. The price is also extremely cheap, and one dollar can buy fifty or sixty. Why do I say that it is suitable for the current season? Because the eggs produced in winter are the cleanest.</p>
<p>Radishes: In the current climate, which is unusually dry, fruits are for a minority of people. For the masses, it is radishes. Speaking of radishes, everyone knows that they not only quench thirst, but are also very valuable in medicine; they can reduce fever and prevent the invasion of diphtheria bacteria. This is also the cheapest medicine!</p>
<p>Winter is traditionally the time to take tonics. However, tonics are not something that our general common people can enjoy. We can only follow the ancient saying: (Medical tonics are not as good as food tonics.) Let's eat some soybean milk, eggs, and radishes.</p>
<h3>Winter Tonics in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhong</p>
<p>The north wind blows tightly in winter, and most people think it's time to take tonics. People in the city usually take red pills, Vitalo, Sanatogen, Zilaixue, and imported tonics like Halibut Liver Oil and Ausmeal Beef Extract. But if we're talking about tonics, why use these imported products? And why send our hard-earned money, millions upon millions, to foreign countries?</p>
<p>There's a saying popular in our countryside: "Food is better than medicine." Indeed, food contains natural tonic ingredients that are suitable for our bodies' nutrition and have unexpectedly effective results. At the same time, they are convenient to obtain, inexpensive, and delicious, achieving multiple benefits in one go. Therefore, the method of "food as tonic" is very popular in our countryside, and there are many varieties.</p>
<p>(1) Boiled Egg with Sugar and Salt: Early in the morning, crack an egg into a bowl, add a little salt, and mix it with boiling water. This is the most common winter tonic in the countryside. Originally, in an agricultural society, chickens were raised in every household, so eggs were produced in large quantities. It doesn't require spending money to buy, and the method of consumption is very simple, so most rural families are happy to take it. However, due to the poverty of the rural economy and the high development of egg production in cities, which led to soaring egg prices, in recent years, farmers have mostly saved them to exchange for essential living expenses.</p>
<p>(2) Soybean Milk: Soybean milk is made by grinding soybeans with water, squeezing out the soybean residue, and boiling it in a pot. If gypsum or salt is added to the soybean milk, filtered dry, and pressed into blocks, it becomes tofu, which is the most common vegetable for side dishes. Soybeans are the main product of our agricultural country, so the application of soybeans is also very wide. Tofu shops can be found everywhere in cities or small rural towns. Villagers often go to tofu shops early in the morning and spend only four or five copper coins to buy a bowl of soybean milk, or bring it back home, soak it with fried dough sticks, tofu skin, or add some white sugar as breakfast. Soybean milk contains a lot of protein and starch, and it is indeed a good tonic.</p>
<p>The above two food tonics are the most widely consumed by the vast farming population in the countryside. They are inexpensive and of good quality, and it is worth introducing them to friends who take tonics in winter. But in fact, when you think carefully, our money is really the hard-earned price of our sweat and blood. In this year of national crisis, under the general panic of personal and national economies, why should we buy imported medicines that are ten or even a hundred times more expensive?</p>
<p>As for the more refined and elaborate food tonics, there are also the following types that are popular in the countryside, but their value is relatively expensive. However, compared with imported medicines, they are still much cheaper.</p>
<p>(3) Beef Tendon: In winter, slaughterhouses are set up in various parts of the countryside. They separate the tendons from each cow's body and sell them dried. Each set costs about four or five yuan. Buy it, wash it clean, and use sugar, wine, soy sauce, and other seasonings to cook it until tender. Pour it into a porcelain basin to congeal into a paste. When eating, cut it into pieces with a knife. It tastes mellow and has the function of strengthening muscles and bones, benefiting qi, and replenishing essence. It is a delicacy among food tonics. It is especially beneficial for the elderly and strong.</p>
<p>(4) Spring Chicken: Take a six- or seven-month-old spring chicken, remove the feathers, put it in a pot, steam it thoroughly, add a little salt, and drink it together with the soup. The chicken is tender and the soup is delicious. It is also a top choice among food tonics. In our countryside, when a child reaches puberty, his family will buy him this tonic to eat. When eating, no one else is allowed to taste it. Even a bone or a tuft of feathers must be wrapped in cloth and buried deep in the mud. It is said that if it is eaten by others or other things, the tonic will be shared, which is inevitably a fabrication of the villagers.</p>
<p>(5) Mutton Soup: Sheep are warm-natured animals, so eating mutton is most suitable in winter. Mutton soup is the soup after the mutton is cooked tender in a pot. It extracts the tonic ingredients contained in the mutton, so naturally mutton soup is also one of the best food tonics. Mutton soup contains a lot of phosphorus and fat, which can nourish the brain and cells. There is a saying in the countryside: "If you have a disease, it will be triggered; if you don't have a disease, your body will develop." People with weak constitutions don't dare to eat it, and people with poor appetites find it difficult to swallow because of the mutton smell. Only people with good constitutions benefit from eating it. "Food is better than medicine." Red pills, Vitalo, Sanatogen… these kinds of Western medicines are just one-time extraction procedures from animals and plants. Why should we almost superstitiously believe that there are any special tonic ingredients in them? In fact, their effect is not as good as eating the original animals and plants, allowing the various organs in our body to freely use their functions to absorb the nutrients they need! Friends who take tonics, why should we buy imported medicines? Why send our hard-earned money, millions upon millions, abroad? Why don't we use inexpensive and high-quality "food tonics"?</p>
<h3>Dad's Cotton-Padded Robe</h3>
<p>— Jia Yunzhao</p>
<p>(Dad! Why is your cotton-padded robe so old and worn!) Song'er is quite spoiled. In winter, when he sees his old father wearing that thirty-year-old cotton-padded robe made of homespun cloth, he always laughs and asks this question, as if mocking his father's stinginess and poverty!</p>
<p>Guoqing—Song'er's father—when impatient with such questions, sometimes speaks to Song'er with a tone of teaching and scolding:</p>
<p>(Little rascal! Who doesn't want to look good! ...Your dad's old cotton-padded robe was made in the thirty-first year of Guangxu and cost seven strings of cash.)</p>
<p>Guoqing often lectures his children, relying on his seniority, with these few rigid points: (1) Be thrifty; (2) Use domestic goods; (3) Listen to the elders. (4) ... (You guys are really comfortable now! You can wear whatever you want! Actually, those foreign goods are all deceptive things. Look at my cotton-padded robe, I've worn it for over thirty years, and even though it's old and worn, isn't it still wearable? ...In the future, when you want to wear clothes, you should be like me and buy some domestic homespun cloth. It's patriotic and saves money, isn't it convenient? ...) Every winter, Guoqing always hums this old tune to his children and gestures to show them his old cotton-padded robe.</p>
<p>Guoqing's older children seem to have been influenced and indoctrinated by him. However, Song'er, whose childishness hasn't faded, still seems to mock his father's stinginess and poverty every winter!</p>
<p>Now, Dad's thirty-year-old cotton-padded robe is still worn, dragging and hanging, on his body every winter!</p>

<h3>Xiao Hua'er</h3>
<p>— Baizi</p>
<p>Since Xiao Hua'er started school, he has become even more likable. So clever, so lively, he has become the source of joy and the only treasure in the family. He is also not naughty. In his innocence, he also carries knowledge and can sometimes say very cute and reasonable things.</p>
<p>On this early winter day, a tea party was held at Xiao Hua'er's house. Many relatives and friends happily arrived and gathered in the spacious living room, which was decorated elegantly. The guests ate snacks, talked, and laughed. His father, mother, older brother, and older sister were all busy entertaining, pouring tea, and passing out cigarettes. Xiao Hua'er also walked back and forth through the crowd, calling out, "Uncle He, please sit down," and then running over to invite Cousin Wang to eat melon seeds. He leaned on this person's lap for a while and then said a few words to that person.</p>
<p>(He's really like a little angel!) the guests all praised Xiao Hua'er. They felt that the atmosphere in the venue today seemed to be even more joyful because of Xiao Hua'er's excitement.</p>
<p>The entertainment began. After the father gave a speech, the older sister danced, the older brother told jokes, and the mother couldn't refuse everyone's request and sang a song. Several guests also participated in wonderful performances, such as magic tricks and boxing.</p>
<p>(We forgot about the little angel!) someone in the crowd suddenly said, but no one knew who it was. This caused everyone to clap, and everyone wanted Xiao Hua'er to present a little something.</p>
<p>Xiao Hua'er stood up, smiling, first bowed to the guests, and then said: (I don't know how to do anything. I remember our teacher said that China is very dangerous because our compatriots are unwilling to use domestic goods, so it is easy to be subjugated. I was unhappy when I heard that. Isn't it painful to be subjugated? So I want to persuade everyone to use domestic goods! I will now sing a song about domestic goods:</p>
<p>Domestic goods, domestic goods, everyone loves using domestic goods, so that China will exist forever and not suffer the pain of subjugation, everyone promotes domestic goods, domestic goods, domestic goods.)</p>
<p>Thus, this lively tea party ended in applause and shouts promoting domestic goods.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Awakened</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Zhongmin is an enthusiast of the national goods movement and a hardworking advocate of domestic goods. Although he is only a young man of twenty-five years old, his loyalty, sincerity, and lack of Westernization have indeed made those who know Mr. Wang deeply admire him. They often say: (Little Wang is truly a rare young man who matches his words with his actions.)</p>
<p>These words have been heard more than once in Mr. Wang's ears. Every time he heard his friends praise him, he would always smile, showing an attitude of both gratitude and pride. Soon, on a certain autumn morning, when Mr. Wang got up early to wash his face and eat snacks, a green-uniformed messenger delivered a registered letter. Mr. Wang opened it and read it. The letter read:</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhongmin: Respectfully, we have set up several agencies to promote domestic goods, and we have all participated in and supported the national goods movement. We have worked tirelessly to reverse the decline of Chinese people worshiping foreign goods and to create a new life for the future of domestic goods. We believe you are well aware of this purpose. Now, in order to expand our business, we are inviting staff, but we do not have enough people to take on the positions. We have long admired your efforts to promote domestic goods, so we are sending this special letter to invite you to take on the position of Director of the Propaganda Department at our factory, with a monthly salary of eighty yuan. We believe that someone as enthusiastic as you will accept our offer. Respectfully, we wish you well.</p>
<p>XX National Goods Factory</p>
<p>XX Month XX Day</p>
<p>After reading this letter, Mr. Wang was so happy that he jumped up, because his original profession was a primary school teacher, and his life was very simple. At the same time, his purpose was to be a loyal advocate of worshiping domestic goods.</p>
<p>How delighted was he to have such a position that suited his purpose and paid a generous salary? So, in less than a week, Mr. Wang resigned from his original school position and went to work at the national goods agency!</p>
<p>From then on, Mr. Wang was even more supported by others and even more admired by his neighbors! Everyone said: (Mr. Wang's future is very promising and he has a lot of potential. He is an extraordinary young man.)</p>
<p>However, the reality was not as the public had guessed. Mr. Wang, whom everyone thought was living a happy life, now seemed unhappy, and his face often showed a worried and unhappy look. In the eyes of the public, this could not be considered a strange thing, and they were eager to know the details.</p>
<p>The reason why Mr. Wang was unhappy and unhappy was not without cause. It was because his wife was causing trouble?</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's wife, Ms. Gu Jiefen, is a complete modern young lady. She believes in foreign goods in everything. Needless to say, the clothes she wears are foreign goods. Her temperament is completely opposite to Mr. Wang's support for domestic goods. Therefore, before Mr. Wang joined the national goods agency, she had repeatedly advised him, but she never listened to Mr. Wang's words.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Wang has gone to work at the national goods agency and is in charge of propaganda. He often goes out to give speeches, persuading people to use domestic goods. However, one of the speeches caused extreme pain in Mr. Wang's heart.</p>
<p>After Mr. Wang gave a speech on the topic of (The National Goods Movement and National Revival), one of the listeners whispered to his friend: (Hum! He pretends to be serious, talking about promoting domestic goods, but he can't even persuade his own wife. Everything she uses and wears is foreign goods. She is a complete foreign goods saleswoman! And he's still saying what…?)</p>
<p>These words were so harsh to Mr. Wang's ears! How heartbreaking!</p>
<p>That night, Mr. Wang cried all night, scaring Ms. Gu into a daze. She couldn't comfort him. Mr. Wang cried for half the night, and Ms. Gu had to accompany him, asking him why he was crying? Why was he unhappy? If there was anything he was unhappy about, I could do it, I would do it, ) Finally, Mr. Wang explained the reason for his crying, and at the same time, his crying became even more severe!</p>
<p>Ms. Gu thought silently. Vanity and love for her husband fought in her heart. She thought: (If I obey my husband, I have to switch to domestic goods. If I use foreign goods, I will make my husband sad.) Finally, she made a decision. She decided to use domestic goods from tomorrow onwards and fulfill her wish to love and protect her husband. After this intention was announced, Mr. Wang became happy again!</p>
<p>Really, Ms. Gu is now really awakened. Everything she uses and wears are domestic goods. From now on, Mr. Wang will no longer hear anyone saying hurtful things to him at the venue.</p>

<h3>Commercial News Finance: American Bank Exchange Rates Shrink Across the Board, Spot Gold Prices Initially Rise Then Weaken, Result Still Good, Up Three Yuan and Forty Cents</h3>
<p>The gold market rose again yesterday, but later overseas telegraphic dispatches deteriorated, prices rose high then declined, market sentiment was initially firm then weakened, supply exceeded demand within the market, and the situation in the half-day market seemed unsustainable. Early in the morning, exchange rates also fell due to the consistent downward trend in the silver market in the UK and US overseas. Forward silver prices on the Metals Exchange fell by varying amounts from 0.061 to 0.075. London spot gold fell by 7.5 pence. The US government did not move the newly mined gold price. US cotton fell by 9 pounds, US wheat rose by 2.5, and stocks fell by 0.3. Wool futures opened and immediately rose to 18.9 yuan, then rose to 22.3 yuan due to purchases by Dadecheng, Yuansheng, Yongdachang, Xiangfuyu, etc. After the opening, the market was firm due to tighter domestic demand. Later, Reuters Washington reported that official sources said the reserve bank had abundant gold reserves, enough to inflate the existing currency by one-half. This statement seemed to indicate that the reserve bank would issue reserve bank banknotes worth 300,000 yuan. Market sentiment turned weak and retreated to within the 20 yuan range. After that, the exchange rate market loosened, market sentiment was weak, and the gold market had difficulty recovering, falling steadily, but still rising compared to the previous close. The clam red price was 1,085 yuan. The situation in the half-day market is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 721 yuan, continuing the previous close by 1.7 yuan. The opening price of goods was the same. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of 1 shilling and 3.5 pence for British exchange and 32.875 yuan for US exchange. Zhengchang, Hongli, Yuanfeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yu Daxing, Yongdadecheng, etc., jointly purchased strips. Pangen Zhengjin, although it stuffed 375 for February US dollars, Huabi Xu needed the same month at the same price but did not get it. In addition, it was known in advance that HSBC's British listing shrunk by 0.125 and the US dropped by 0.375. Therefore, it rose from 0.08 yuan to 23.6 yuan. Later, McGalli Shanghai stuffed 0.0625 for January US dollars, Mitsui stuffed 375 for February US dollars, Hengxing and Zhaofengchang sold strips, and retailers worked hard to depress prices. Although Dadecheng and Bingxing entered, they gradually fell to 1.4 yuan. At this time, there was a lot of hovering, and the situation was still stable. Until April US dollars were difficult to sell for 875, Bingxing Zhifengyong sold to 0.05 yuan, but because Zhifengyong entered and then sold again, the gold market recovered from 1.6 yuan and gradually went downstream. Reuters reported that the US issued banknotes. Bingxing Fuchang Fushun Dadecheng Hongli jointly sold vigorously, and it fell to within 18 yuan, but there were still several times of hovering. After entering, the domestic market hardened, market sentiment was weak, Dadecheng Fuyu Zhengchang Daxingyong sold again, and retreated to within 6 yuan. Although Tongtaichang and Bingxing entered, it was difficult to save the situation. Under the vigorous sales of Hengxing Zhifengyong Fuyu Qianchangxiang Wanxing, even though April US dollars were 1875, there were few buyers, so it fell to 14.6 yuan. Hengyu took strips at low prices, and the noon close was 715.7 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 5.4 yuan. Finally, it was slightly frustrated by the continued supply of strips from Changshengyongji. It was found that the highest in the half-day was 723.6 yuan, the lowest was 714.6 yuan, and there was a difference of 9 yuan. As a result, it rose by 3.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 738 yuan due to HSBC's listing of US exchange shrinking by 0.375 to 32.5 yuan. According to the closing price, it pressed about 22 yuan, which was 5 yuan more than the previous close. The bookkeeping price for this month was 722 yuan, and for January it was 716 yuan. The replenishment water in the morning was 722 yuan, and the clam red price was 1,085 yuan. The situation in the market continued to be quiet and lacked transactions. Generally, the Tianjin gang was slightly willing to supply, but at a price of 1,085 yuan, there were few buyers. Only Yinfenghheng bought Dalian goods for 1,081 to 82 yuan, with only about 300 taels of transactions. 4,438 strips remained for this month.</p>
<p>Supply exceeded demand in the market. In summary, Hengxing Changshengyong Yuanxing Yongheng Taixiang Heyifeng Yongdakangfu Taiheng Fuyu Huixiang Yongfeng Zhaofengchang Zhifeng Yongshunli Wanxing, etc. were on the selling side, Dadecheng Yuansheng Yong Yuanchun Bingxing Daxingyong Xiexing Yongheng Yu Hongli Dachangxiang Qianchangxiang, etc. were on the buying side. Qianchangxiang Dachangxiang Hongli Dadecheng, etc. advanced first and then exited. Tongtaichang Hengyu exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang Xianli jointly did more than 2,100 strips, squeezing out more than 700. Wanxing jointly did more than 1,800 strips, squeezing out more than 400. The Guangdong gang Hengxing entered a small number and exited more than 300 strips. In summary, there were 32,592 chips for January.</p>

<h3>Grains, Flour, Wheat: A Flat and Weak Situation</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, due to the impact of the tariff on foreign wheat flour, all parties became active, and sentiment was very good. There were also floating accounts covering positions, and factories adhered to their prices. Near and distant months were reported up by 1 to 2 fen. After the market price rose, buyers stopped, and the actual sales of North Ocean flour suddenly stopped. Factories that had set prices for foreign wheat took the opportunity to sell small amounts. Furthermore, people generally believed that flour and wheat prices were already high. If actual sales did not move, the market might not be able to hold. Therefore, buyers stopped, and selling pressure increased, leading to a uniform decline in all months in the afternoon. The closing price was down 2 fen for the current month, down 1 fen each for December and January, down 0.75 fen each for March and May, and down 0.5 fen for April.</p>
<p>The wheat market showed near-month gains and distant-month declines for foreign wheat. Although there were additional tariffs on foreign wheat, it was still cost-effective, and all factories uniformly stopped buying. Market prices for each month remained flat and weak. In the current month, there were even bulls covering positions. The closing price was down 4 fen for the current month, unchanged for January, up 1 fen for February, unchanged for March, and down 1 fen for April. There were few current wheat arrivals and sales. The whole city was managed by Hua Feng, who handled 1,500 bags of Bengbu wheat, priced at 4.25 to 4.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Late Rice: Although Demand for Bundled Rice is Strong, Prices Only Rise by Half a Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources from various groups are relatively large, with a total of over 70 ships arriving at the docks (estimated at over 9,000 shi), of which late rice accounts for half. The outlet for bundled rice has also slightly turned around. Since the opening of the early market, groups from Qingdao, Yantai, etc. have been quite active, handling over 4,000 bags one after another. The market shape has rebounded again, but the price has only increased by 5 fen. Urban and rural stores have strong sales, but arrivals are too high, resulting in insufficient digestion. Market conditions are difficult to rise. Today, the old state remains, and the prices of thick japonica and Du Yangjian from Changbang and other groups remain stable. The sales of cloudy Yuan liquor are not widespread, and prices continue to weaken by a jiao or so.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The sources number 45 to 56. The sales of various goods in the market have become more active. The market shape has high-quality white japonica standing firm. Mid-grade and lower-grade prices have increased by nearly a jiao. The prices of Yang Du Bu Xian rice are firm. The price of white Yuan rice has increased by several fen. Thin rice has weakened by a jiao or so. Broken japonica and Hakka Xian rice have not changed much.</p>
<h3>Hakka Xian Rice: Prices Creep Up by 3 to 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of Hakka Xian rice from local customers were weak. The total market transactions were less than 1,000 bags. However, with the report that tariffs will be implemented, speculators have intentions to buy. Furthermore, production prices have already risen, and there are not many arrivals. People are optimistic, and market prices have been raised by several fen. Throughout the day, the Guangdong group handled 200 bags of Hunan red rice, Xiamen handled 250 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed late rice, Ningbo handled 220 bags of Wuhu Yuan rice, and Shashi handled 120 bags of coarse rice. Prices were said to have crept up by 3 to 5 fen compared to yesterday's market.</p>
<h3>Soybean Sales Continue Uninterrupted</h3>
<p>Soybean sales have continued, with no interruption. Yesterday, factories and local streets traded about eight or nine cartloads of various beans. Market prices have slightly increased by 2 to 3 fen. With such a daily increase of 2 to 3 fen, the market trend is becoming firmer. Furthermore, sources are decreasing. High and medium-grade market prices have increased, so sentiment is good. Du beans have not been arriving continuously, and the market shape is stable. Shashi yellow beans have been arriving in slightly larger quantities, and market prices have weakened by 4 to 5 fen.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods and Miscellaneous Dried Goods: Round Sales in the Market Show Slight Activity</h3>
<p>The arrivals of miscellaneous longans have been scarce recently, and trading in the market has shown slight activity. Yesterday, stores in the South City opened over 100 boxes, with higher-priced ones priced at 48 to 46 yuan, mid-range ones priced at 32 to 28 yuan, and lower-priced ones ranging from 24 to 25 yuan to 16 yuan. There was also a batch from Xin Gao Zhuang, but due to unmet prices, inquiries have been telegraphed to the origin, and a decision will be made upon reply.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: The Asking Price for Domestic Qing Sugar Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained stable as speculative funds rose again. The guild set the price for Grade 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods at 19.95 yuan, and the transshipment bill of lading rose by 5 fen to 7.15 yuan. Grade 89 Dutch red ordinary goods were priced at 15.65 yuan, with the transshipment goods at the original price. Tai Gu Sugar B brand remained at 20.25 yuan. Zhen Ji No. 1 cotton white was priced at 18.9 yuan, with grades 2, 3, and 4 following suit. Today, 180 boxes of sliced Qing sugar that are available for arrival were priced at 10 yuan. Fujian group stores opened 150 bags of Chen Zhang Nai Qing sugar, priced at 14.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Sea Vegetables Sell Out Immediately Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>Both the arrival and storage of sea vegetables are fresh, and the market prices of each grade have uniformly risen. Yesterday, stores opened sales of Lion Mane vegetable priced at 16.2 yuan, Gao Xi Lan vegetable at 14.5 to 13.8 yuan, Dragon Sprout vegetable at 10.04 yuan, second-grade at 9.2 to 8.8 yuan, and Di Long vegetable at 8.1 yuan. However, demand was still strong, and all 273 bags that arrived were sold.</p>
<h3>Metals: Rising Trend in Hui Si Iron Resumes</h3>
<p>The rising trend in Hui Si iron has frequently occurred in recent days. Yesterday, goods from the new steel factory could be priced up to 29 yuan per box, an increase of 5 jiao from before. Goods from the old steel factory were priced at 30.05 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan from before. Although transactions with customer groups have not seen progress, factories have thrown in futures in recent days, which is not a small amount. Overall, the situation in the city is very optimistic. However, overseas prices have continued to rise recently, and it is feared that the local market will also see price increases.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Joint Steel Bar Market Shows Loosening</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrivals of bamboo joint steel bars have been brisk, but purchases and sales by customer groups and construction groups have been relatively slow. Therefore, the market price has loosened somewhat. It is estimated at 110 yuan per ton, a decrease of 10 yuan from before. It is heard that in recent days, apart from a few transactions, large transactions have been very scarce.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Progress in Overseas Sales of Chinese Silk Awaits</h3>
<p>Countries Restricting the Dumping of Japanese Silk. In recent years, Japanese silk has been actively dumped overseas, attracting international attention. According to reliable news from Taihe Xinfu and other firms in this port, silk industry representatives from various countries held an international silk industry conference in Paris a month ago. The British representative suggested restricting the dumping of Japanese silk and instructed representatives from each country to contact their respective governments to implement restrictions on the quantity of Japanese silk imports, limited to the average silk import volume between 1927 and 1930. Although representatives from the United States and Italy expressed slight dissent at the meeting, believing this method was too harsh, the original proposal was passed due to the majority of those in favor. This is indeed good news amidst the declining overseas sales of Chinese silk.</p>
<p>Wuxi Stored Cocoons Transported to Shanghai for Sale. As the end of the year approaches, general cocoon merchants are eager to sell their stored dry cocoons in the mainland. Yesterday, 137 bags of autumn dry cocoons from Wuxi were loaded and stored for sale.</p>
<p>The Sales of Artificial Silk Gradually Become Active. Mainland silk weaving factories are now preparing to weave spring silk. With stable foreign exchange rates, the sales of artificial silk to customers are gradually becoming active. Yesterday, silk merchants from Hangshao and other places submitted 40 boxes of Kong Que San Qi, Kaily Wu Guang and other brands for futures in the current month and January and February at the guild, priced from 184.75 to 169.75 yuan net.</p>
<p>Factory Warp Silk Door Sales Smooth, Prices Stable. Although European and American markets are already weaving spring silks, silk weaving consumption is gradually increasing, and silk stocks are thick. With unremitting efforts to dump Japanese silk, silk prices remain difficult to rise. Chinese silk is still too expensive when telegraphed, and there are few shipments to Shanghai. Although European and American firms in this port have been holding positions, their asking prices are actually lower than mainland users. Recently, demand at the silk door has become smoother, with both yellow and white factory warp silk being purchased. Yesterday, silk merchants from Shanghai and Hangzhou purchased 30 packages of white factory warp silk and 10 packages of yellow factory warp silk. Prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market is Increasingly Declining: ▲Bai Tou Zhuang Only Procured 35 Boxes of Xiu Mei Tea</h3>
<p>Due to the thin stocks of Lu Zhuang green tea, English firms and foreign firms in this port's tea market have stopped purchasing. Local Zhuang tea factories have also suspended production and closed down due to sluggish sales. Yesterday, only Rui Chang Foreign Firm of Bai Tou Zhuang purchased 35 boxes of low-Zhuang Xiu Mei tea, priced at 11 yuan. The market conditions were extremely low.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Silver Prices and China's Price Level by Louis Zhang Luluan</h3>
<p>Some people believe that if the United States and other American countries could adopt silver as currency, the purchasing power of silver could be increased, which would indirectly be equivalent to increasing China's purchasing power in the world market. However, in fact, it is just the opposite. Increasing the price of silver would gradually lower the internal price level in China, and a severe economic depression would occur in China immediately, and the import of foreign goods would naturally decrease even more.</p>
<p>China's price level began to fall in May 1931, which was when the world's silver purchasing power began to increase. Now, China has shown a very serious economic unrest phenomenon. If China wants to avoid this kind of depression, it seems that it can adopt a commodity currency system, in which the amount of silver contained can be changed at any time to maintain the stability of its price.</p>
<p>(1) The increase in the price of silver lowers China's price level. Except for a few restrictions, silver occupies a very important market in the world. Any factor abroad that affects the increase in the purchasing power of silver soon has the same trend in China. Because China is a silver standard country, the increase in the purchasing power of silver can be observed in the decrease in its wholesale prices. Conversely, if the purchasing power of silver decreases, China's wholesale prices will rise again.</p>
<p>If 1910 to 1914 is used as the base period, in 1887, the purchasing power of silver was 209.5 in the UK and 209.2 in China. In 1930, the purchasing power of silver decreased to 57.9 in the UK and 60.3 in China. It was not until 1931 that the purchasing power of silver began to increase. If the annual average of silver's purchasing power in 1932 is taken, the result is 67.5 in China and 69.1 in the UK. In the above period, excluding the European War period, the decreasing trend of silver's purchasing power in the UK was often balanced and close to the purchasing power of silver in China. Before this period, the silver purchasing power index in China was often one year slower than in the UK, but after the European War, the difference between the two was very small.</p>
<p>Before the European War, the Shanghai National Tariff Commission had published the monthly wholesale price index in Shanghai. Since 1924, the Institute of Economics of Nankai University in Tianjin has also published the monthly wholesale price index in North China. If this monthly wholesale price index is compared with the monthly index of silver's purchasing power in the UK and the United States from 1921, it can clearly tell us that whenever the purchasing power of silver increases abroad, the domestic wholesale price index in China will decrease at the same time, and vice versa.</p>
<p>If we can carefully observe the trend of the difference between the two, the highest monthly index of silver's purchasing power abroad is often opposite to China's monthly wholesale price index. The relationship between the two is very close. However, when the UK and the United States abandoned the gold standard, the trend of China's wholesale price index being opposite to the silver purchasing power index in the UK and the United States was not very obvious.</p>
<p>Until mid-1931, the world's silver purchasing power gradually increased, and at the same time, China's price level gradually decreased. If 1926 is used as the base period, in 1931, China's North China price index was as high as 125, and Shanghai was as high as 230. By July and August 1933, China's wholesale price index suddenly dropped to the same price level as the base period of 1926. At the same time, the purchasing power index of British silver also increased from the lowest point in 1931 to almost equal to the index in the base period of 1926.</p>
<p>(2) The Purchasing Power of Silver Seems to Have a Continuing Increasing Trend</p>
<p>Among the world's various goods, in recent years, because the increase in silver production has been slower, the matter of turning silver into silver for sale is actually prevented by the Nine-Nation Silver Convention, and other countries may adopt part of the silver to be used as currency. The purchasing power of the currency is quite likely to gradually increase in the future.</p>
<p>The reason why the purchasing power of silver has decreased is that during the period from 1887 to 1931, most countries in the world adopted the gold standard and did not use silver as their currency. At the same time, selling silver to at least a few countries that still used the silver standard was greater than demand, so the price fell sharply. Many countries abandoned the silver standard from 1902 to 1922, so the increase in China's price level was the same as the increase rate in the amount of silver stored. In recent years, the amount of silver sold has increased even more, until September 1931, the rate of increase in China's prices was faster than the rate of increase in the world's stored silver.

<h3>Chrysanthemums and the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>If you are interested this month, take a walk in the countryside. The impressions you bring back will invariably be chrysanthemums by the creek, chrysanthemums under the fence, chrysanthemums in the flower garden, and even chrysanthemums next to the outhouse. Indeed, chrysanthemums are truly too common this season. No matter which house you go to, in the courtyard, in the flower pots, there will always be a few chrysanthemums to decorate. To put it on a smaller scale, chrysanthemums are also inserted in vases. If there are no vases, a few flower heads that have already drooped are sparsely immersed in salted vegetable bottles. If you don't believe it, please step into the market or the entertainment venue. There are invariably potted chrysanthemums placed at the entrance, in the corridors, or on the tea tables. Even in Ningbo restaurants, Wuxi noodle shops, Tianjin potsticker shops, and Guangdong late-night snack shops, there are also two or three pots of chrysanthemums on display. Because in this season, the other famous flowers and exotic plants have withered due to their intolerance to the cold, chrysanthemums occupy such a large position. Therefore, chrysanthemums are highly valued (praised as solitary and fragrant), (with proud and craggy bones), (with the demeanor of a high-minded scholar). However, in this era, everything must be approached positively. If one escapes from the troubles of the world and becomes a recluse, this kind of decadent and passive outlook on life cannot be taken as a model. Therefore, I believe that putting these extremely elegant hats on the head of the (chrysanthemum) is not in line with the trend. In my humble opinion, the (chrysanthemum) occupies the same position as the volunteer army fighting in the frontier, showing a similar spirit.</p>
<p>The volunteer army operates after the formal army withdraws, and the chrysanthemum blooms after the hundred flowers wither. This is the first point of similarity. The volunteer army is not afraid of violence, and the chrysanthemum is not afraid of the autumn wind. This is the second point of similarity. The volunteer army can fight with supplies, and can also fight without supplies. The chrysanthemum can bloom with irrigation, and can also bloom without irrigation. This is the third point of similarity. The volunteer army is ubiquitous, and the chrysanthemum is everywhere. This is the fourth point of similarity. After being injured, the volunteer army can disperse and reunite. After withering, the chrysanthemum sprouts new buds the following year. This is the fifth point of similarity. The more the volunteer army fights, the more there are. The more the chrysanthemum branches are cut, the denser they become. This is the sixth point of similarity.</p>
<p>Finally, there is another layer. Although chrysanthemums can embellish the autumn colors, they cannot extend to the spring, summer, and winter seasons, just as the volunteer army, although able to struggle and strive, ultimately cannot rely on it to recover the lost mountains and rivers. It can even be said that the fate of chrysanthemums and the volunteer army similarly contains blood and tears.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Bivouacking at Yuan Gong Mound in West Lake</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lin</p>
<p>After the bell rang, the company commander came to our tent and urged us to change shifts and stand guard at night. We crawled out of the tent from the slightly warm bedding, and the cold air outside the tent directly invaded our drowsy eyes. I, who was assigned to a position on the lake, listlessly supported that Boy Scout wooden stick. But I was not so comfortable. Because the wind at night was particularly cold and piercing, even if you fell asleep, you would wake up, let alone me, who was drowsy? Yuan Gong Mound is surrounded by water, with nothing but our dark tents. Turning to the commander's tent, there was only a faint red light in the middle. The lake was extremely calm. There were no yachts, and human voices were cut off. There was only the sound of large and low waves, and the sound of the wind from somewhere. The high mountains on the opposite bank were no longer visible, only the streetlights at the foot of the mountain, and the light columns reflected by thousands of rivers from the new market in the east, were slightly trembling.</p>
<p>The bell rang again, and the melodious sound swirled among the trees around the mound, and then seemed to dissipate. But I continued to hear long and low echoes in my ears. My spirit sank again, and I counted numbers in my heart, trying to eliminate the torment of the cold.</p>
<p>The bell that brought good news rang again. It was making a sound again in the surrounding silence. Footsteps, shouts, and soon the shifts were changed. The person who came greeted me in a hoarse voice. I was very happy to leave that trembling friend. I went back into the already cold bedding. But it was much better than outside. Then I could no longer hear the bell, and there was only the sound of steady breathing in the dead and heavy tent.</p>
<h3>Women are Food</h3>
<p>— Qifeng Louzhu</p>
<p>Why do men love women? Because their whole bodies are delicious things, and most of them are sweet and fragrant fresh fruits. How can this not make men drool and try their best to pursue them? If you don't believe it, let me list them briefly as follows:</p>
<p>Apricot Dimples</p>
<p>Pearly Wrinkles</p>
<p>Peach Cheeks</p>
<p>Lotus Root Arms</p>
<p>Gallbladder Nose (only great heroes dare to take on the gallbladder)</p>
<p>Spring Onion Fingers</p>
<p>Cherry Lips</p>
<p>Buttery Breasts</p>
<p>Clove Tongue</p>
<p>Powdered Legs</p>
<p>Shell-like Teeth</p>
<p>Lily Hooks (now it should be changed to lily boats)</p>
<h3>Healing the Sick... Healing Fish</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>My mother's vitality has been weak for a long time. In recent days, her dysentery has become extremely severe. More than a dozen famous Chinese and Western doctors have been consulted for diagnosis and treatment. Western doctors call it "bacterial dysentery" and mainly use injections. Chinese medicine calls it "aphthous dysentery" and prescribes formulas, but the medicine is so nauseating that she cannot swallow it. For ten days, not only has there been no improvement, but her condition has worsened daily. Only her mind remains clear, and she murmurs instructions about trivial household matters, unaware that she is nearing her end. The family attends to her all night, and I have been unable to sleep for five or six days. Exhausted, I wish I could take her place whenever I see my old mother groan in pain. There are many famous doctors in Suzhou, and we cannot be said to be unwilling to spend money. However, Chinese doctors are jealous of Western doctors, and Western doctors are envious of Chinese doctors. Each side argues their own logic, and we listen to their instructions, but my mother's pain does not lessen. I fear she will become a target in the battle between Chinese and Western medicine. Alas, it is truly difficult! As the saying goes, "One should not throw medicine around haphazardly," but as a son, how can I bear to sit idly by? I wonder if it is the doctors' lack of skill or my mother's incurable illness? I truly cannot know.</p>
<p>Goldfish are my most beloved possessions for the past twenty years. Recently, I gathered like-minded people and established Fish Paradise on Haig Road in West Shanghai. Raising fish requires understanding their nature and is not difficult at first. However, during the yellow plum season, they easily fall ill. Someone once asked me, "Why do the fish I buy die in a day or two?" This is because they do not understand their nature. Regardless of the type of goldfish, if they are placed in an area with fresh air and ample sunlight, with plenty of water and properly portioned food, then all is well. If the fish become ill, they should be quickly moved to an empty tank to await their recovery. One must not let nature take its course, or the entire tank of fish will quickly die. To discern whether a sick fish can be saved, observe the color of its body. If the color of a sick fish is darker than its original color, then it is certain to die. Conversely, it can be cured. This is my personal experience. I dare say that I have more insight into treating fish than doctors in Suzhou have into treating illnesses. Although the difference between humans and fish is vast, the principle is the same. It seems that I do not have that good of luck, to say even more, even my model is not worth a few bones from Su Xiao Xiao's tomb on Xiling Bridge, this is such a heart-breaking thing!</p>
<p>Every time I take a completed painting out of the studio and look back at the mentally exhausted model, I always feel a bit sad. I think: if I have even a trace of success in art, at least half of it was plundered from that poor model.</p>
<h3>Life Drawing Studio</h3>
<p>— Fu Yiye</p>
<p>Generally, when the weather turns cold, there are fewer people in the plaster and still life studios. The most lively place is the life drawing studio because it has a warm stove. Even those who don't usually draw there love to come in to warm themselves. Especially during the ten-minute break after class, everyone becomes as excited as fire-worshipers, immediately forming a wall of bodies around the stove.</p>
<p>I often feel happy during this ten-minute break. The reason is that I can warm up my stiff hands and take a turn around the room to look at other people's drawings. And when I walk back to my easel and see that today's colors are pleasing, I feel even happier. The sculptor Rodin said: "The greatest happiness is when you see your work done well." This is truly a reasonable saying.</p>
<p>However, our model, patiently supporting the fixed pose, allows us to work slowly. Her constant and noble sacrifice is naturally not compensated by a few dimes a day. But, in fact, it is often paradoxical: when a painting is completed, its highest value belongs entirely to the painter, not to the model. Throughout art history, we only know the glorious reputations of Da Vinci, Courbet, and David. Who knows the models who posed for their works of art?</p>
<p>Naturally, poets and landscape painters praise and describe a lake or mountain that is not particularly beautiful. The reputation of that lake or mountain increases and lasts for ages, like Brunnin's Lake Bourget, Gauguin's Tahiti, and Wang Wei's Wangchuan. But models are also the objects of art.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Platoon Leader of the Northeast, Zhang Henshui – Episode 20: An Auspicious Day is Foretold, the Old Man Smiles for Days; Endless Sorrow Erased, Old Friends Live Across the Street</h3>
<p>After Zhao Weng finished speaking, he moved the paper, brush, inkstone, and ink from the small table in the inner room to the large table outside. He opened the inkstone and began grinding ink while standing by the table, facing Jiang Shi as he said with a smile: "Naturally, someone like Ziqiang would not agree to an old-fashioned wedding. I think your eldest daughter would also prefer a modern wedding. First, there's the music band and decorated carriage, which will cost fifty yuan. We can add a bit more, say sixty yuan. The bride wears a veil, and we'll be thrifty and rent it instead of buying it. Anyway, it's only for that one moment. My family doesn't have much money, so of course we'll borrow from a restaurant to host the feast. What do you think?" As he spoke, he ground the ink, revealing his impatient expression. Jiang Shi only mentioned that Zhao Ziqiang should ask for leave to return. She hasn't mentioned a single one of the thousands of other matters, yet this old man is already starting a wedding expense list. She really hadn't thought about these things, so how should she respond? She smiled and said, "These things are easy to handle. As long as we can maintain appearances, we're happy to unite our families. What else is there to say?" Zhao Weng was overjoyed, but upon hearing these words, the two joyful red patches on his face immediately receded, and he said blandly with a smile, "These things will always need to be done, sooner or later we'll need to discuss them." As he said this, he stopped grinding the ink in the inkstone. Jiang Shi saw that her words might have greatly disappointed him, so she said with a smile, "Old Master is always so enthusiastic, unlike us women who are indecisive. You can entrust the arrangements to me. It's good to entrust them early. As we think of things, we'll entrust them one by one. Before the date arrives, everything will be fully prepared. When the day comes, you can relax and drink a few extra glasses of wedding wine." Zhao Weng stroked his beard and said with a smile, "Isn't that exactly what I meant?" As he said this, his face regained some joy. He slowly sat down in the armchair by the table and then picked up his brush to dab it in the inkstone. (267)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>Shanghai Vernacular (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Prologue: The library's announcement board was prominently displaying the covers of newly arrived books. Among them, a Western book titled "Shanghai Bird" caught my attention with its cover and title. So, I retrieved it from the stacks. It was a thick, 10x6-inch book, a foreign import, with a green cover and gilded title, looking quite impressive. I flipped through it from beginning to end in one go. It turned out to be an investigative report on the birds of Shanghai. Ah, how meticulous! This Westerner thoroughly investigated the birds of Shanghai. What is this? The author is not the only one who has come to China to investigate birds. According to the author's introduction, there are two Frenchmen, three Englishmen, one German, and two Americans who have come to China to investigate birds and have written books of over a hundred thousand words. But we, the masters, have been spared this trouble because someone else has already taken care of it for us.</p>
<p>The Definition of Shanghai Birds</p>
<p>Because climates differ from place to place, the environment varies, so the products of each place also differ. Shanghai has its own environment and climate, so Shanghai also has its own special products. The life of birds is closely related to climate and environment, so each place has its own birds. But birds can fly. If a Shanghai bird is happy, it can also take a trip to Nanjing. Nanjing birds can also come to Shanghai to play. So, the term "Shanghai bird" is very vague. But now we have a definition: (All birds that commonly live in Shanghai or are commonly seen in Shanghai are collectively called Shanghai birds.)</p>
<p>Types of Shanghai Birds</p>
<p>(1) Blackbird: The body is mostly black. The male's beak and eyes are orange-brown. The legs are slightly black. The female's chest and abdomen are brown. The chin is white. The chest is dirty brown with dark spots. The beak and legs are brown. The length is about ten and a half inches. The call sounds like "Tzik-Taik."</p>
<p>(2) Warbler: About eight inches long. The top of the head is black. The neck and abdomen are white. The wings and back are green-grey. The call is very pleasant. It can be roughly divided into four types: When singing, it makes a "Shokuji-Shokuji-Shokuji'Eoready" sound. When courting or showing off to enemies, it makes a "Chee-OO-Chee-OO-ChenOO-Chee-OＯ" sound. When hungry or warning companions, the sound is very rough, and it flaps its wings, making a noise.</p>
<p>(3) Bunting: Also known as Yellow-browed Bunting. The male's body is mostly brown with a glossy sheen. The feathers and beak have black stripes. The cheeks and eyebrows are white. The ear feathers are black. The underside of the body is pale red-brown. The female's cheeks and eyebrows are yellow. The ear wings are dark brown. The underside of the body is pale brown. The length is about six inches. The call sounds like "Tzirrip." There are different types of buntings, such as Rock Bunting, Chestnut Bunting, Field Bunting, and Snow Bunting.</p>
<p>(4) Teal: The feathers are black. The sides of the abdomen are brown-grey. The legs and feet are dark red. The length is about sixteen inches. The beak tip is about one and a half inches long. It is seen in early summer and late autumn.</p>
<p>(5) Crow: The color is black and relatively large. The beak is strong and straight, and the base of the beak has bristles covering the nostrils. The upper part of the body is black. The base of the wings is dark with a green sheen. The legs are relatively thin and black. Four toes touch the ground, and the toe ends have claws. The male's vocal organs have a special syrinx. The body length is one foot and eight inches.</p>
<p>(6) Cuckoo: Also known as Budu. It is one foot long. The colors of the young and adult are different. The adult's feather color is almost indistinguishable from the cuckoo, only the body is slightly larger, and the horizontal black stripes on the chest and abdomen are very thin, only half an inch wide. The young's upper body, from head to tail, is mostly reddish-brown with many black horizontal spots, but the waist and abdomen have none. The underside of the body, from chin to tail root, has a pale yellow color, the same as the adult's color. The call sounds like "Cuck-Cuck-Coo."</p>
<p>(7) Cuckoo: The eyelids are yellow, the beak is curved, the base of the beak is yellow, the tip is dark, the upper body and cheeks are grey-black, the underside of the body is white with many dark horizontal stripes, and the tail is also grey. In early summer, it wails day and night, sometimes flying and singing in the sky on dark nights, which many people hear.</p>

<h3>Young Writers</h3>
<p>— Xiaozu</p>
<p>Several years ago, a certain fiction publisher printed a series of young writers' books and advertised heavily, saying it was to find a way out for unknown writers. A friend sent a manuscript to them, and they replied with many words of praise, claiming that it would be printed soon. Later, he sent another letter asking about royalties and advances, which unexpectedly aroused their anger. They replied with a scolding, saying that printing books for young writers was a losing business. They said he should look at his own work to see if it was worth anything before talking about royalties and advances, implying that the young writer was too ungrateful. The final words were that if he wanted money, they would return the manuscript.</p>
<p>From this experience, I learned that it is not easy for young, unknown writers to squeeze into the literary world. At the very least, their blood must first be sucked dry by the publishers. Recently, I encountered a similar situation. A friend sent a creation to a certain literary magazine that claimed to be dedicated to promoting new writers. Afraid that the editor wouldn't even look at it and would just throw it away, he specially asked someone who knew the editor-in-chief to write a letter of introduction to attach to it. Although he stated that he hoped for a quick reply, there was no reply. After several reminders, more than a month later, the manuscript was sent back by someone from the magazine. Not only was it unopened, but even the slip with the recipient's address and name hadn't been changed, probably because the sender's name and address were written on the last line, saving the magazine some trouble. My friend was bewildered. He opened it in public, and the letter of introduction was still lying there. Only then did he know for sure that the editor had not deigned to read it and had returned it unopened. But this magazine always has one or two creations by new writers in each issue.</p>
<p>This second experience made me understand that young writers have not only those who directly suck their blood but also accomplices who use the beautiful name of promoting young writers as a guise to increase the magazine's sales among young readers, allowing themselves and their bosses to gain both fame and fortune.</p>
<p>As for the so-called new manuscripts that still appear in each issue, I think it is either because the young writer has a special relationship with the editor or because, after drinking (mellow wine), the editor occasionally gets inspired and randomly picks one or two to pass the time, an unintentional discovery. In that case, the fate of young writers is no different from winning the lottery, it all depends on (chance).</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, where should our young writers go?</p>
<h3>A Dangerous Journey to Xianxia (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>We searched for empty houses like this for several places before finding a base camp of troops stationed there. The guarding soldiers were initially very suspicious of us, of course, but after listening to our explanations, he finally spoke, saying: (There were rumors again last night, and the residents moved out long ago, since last September. It's very difficult to get a meal here because no one makes tofu or vegetables. But this morning, the captain received a letter from Stationmaster Hu of Jiangshan, so he's probably preparing something.) After saying this, he invited us to the hall to rest. Seeing this situation and hearing those words, our appetites had long been defeated by terror. So, we said "May the captain be well," jumped into the car, and turned around to leave.</p>
<p>When we returned to that pass at Xiaoganling, the guard with the big knife, who had interrogated us a few minutes earlier and fortunately let us pass safely after seeing Mr. Chen Wanli's badge as proof, smiled and said to us: (Are you going back already?) Having returned past this pass, we were already in a safe area. Our courage grew, so we got out of the car next to the creek at Longxi, at a place called Dawu Creek Bridge, intending to climb the mountain to see with our own eyes that Xianxia Pass, which could also be said to be a place where "one man guards the pass, and ten thousand cannot pass," with its stone road paved by Hao Fang in the Song Dynasty. At the same time, we told the empty car to return by the original route and wait for us at Bao'an Village, five li north of Xianxia Pass, so that we could go up the ridge from the south of the pass and down the mountain from the north of the pass, looking at the scenery along the way.</p>
<p>According to the books, Xianxia Ridge has three hundred and sixty steps, twenty-four bends, five passes, and X peaks, etc. Because we went up from the middle of the mountain, we only walked the section where the pass was located.</p>
<p>Xianxia Pass has four gates in front and behind. Next to the second gate, near the top, there is a newly built blockhouse. According to Stationmaster Hu, who accompanied us on our tour, there are more than forty blockhouses near Jiangshan, which were recently built. But once the automobile road opens, these blockhouses and this majestic pass will probably become ancient relics with only a name.</p>
<p>Inside Xianxia Pass, on the top of the ridge, there is a Xialing Pavilion. Next to the pavilion lives a family, probably the residence of the officials guarding the pass in the past. Now, only an old man remains, selling tea to passersby.</p>
<p>Leaving the pass on the north side, descending the ridge for about a li, there is a Guandi Temple. It is large in scale, with Guanyin Pavilion, Huanxia Pond Pavilion, and other buildings. Probably the officials of Fujian and Zhejiang who came and went in the past undoubtedly stayed in this temple. Now, on the east side of the Huanxia Pond Pavilion, there are still many poems by Zhou Liangong about passing the pass, as well as poems by famous officials of the early Qing Dynasty, embedded in the middle of the stone wall.</p>
<p>After drinking a bowl of tea at the Guandi Temple and buying some famous Xianxia Pass green tea leaves, the evening glow had already surrounded the mountainside, and we all felt a bit damp on our hands and faces. Everyone shouted out in unison:</p>
<p>(Ah! So this is Xianxia! If you don't come here, you really don't know the wonder of this pass name!)</p>
<p>Descending the ridge, crossing the creek, and walking to Bao'an Village by the creek, we got into the car and took another look at the mountain ridge we had walked. This majestic fortress in the southeast had already shyly hidden itself in a vast white Xianxia embrace.</p>
<h3>Stars</h3>
<p>— Wei Zengben</p>
<p>Night! No stars, no light.</p>
<p>A person, hurrying along in the darkness, lonely... When will I find a suitable lodging, when will I be able to settle down my soul, tired to death?</p>
<p>(But it is night! No stars, no light.)</p>
<p>Oh, thank heaven! In the dark night, I actually saw a joyful, bright star. Although it is said to be in the distant distance, shining with a faint glow, it stirred up warmth in a soul tired to death, knowing that I am not on a dark, lonely journey.</p>
<p>...Oh! Where is that bright star? It seems that a dark tentacle, rising from the darkness, has devoured this unfortunate star! And so:</p>
<p>Ahead! Black, misty fog. Behind! Black, misty fog.</p>
<p>Night! No stars, no light. A person, hurrying along in the darkness, lonely... When will I find a suitable lodging? When will I be able to settle down my soul, tired to death? (But it is night! No stars, no light.)</p>
<p>Oh, thank heaven! In the dark night, now I actually see another joyful, bright star. Although it is said to be in the distant distance, it is shining with a flame-like glow! This star will rise with flame-like tentacles to devour the darkness, right?</p>
<h3>Reply to Mr. Shi Heng</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Heng:</p>
<p>You have again pointed out my erroneous opinions in detail, not only enlightening me but also greatly benefiting many writers of (Free Talk) who study artistic problems. I said long ago that I have not studied literature and art. I am simply discussing with you based on a bit of ordinary reason. Now, under your guidance, I very much want to abandon my fallacious views on art, but doing so would require fundamentally overturning that bit of ordinary reason, which I cannot do. Therefore, I can only continue to maintain my fallacious views that (conflict) with your esteemed opinion. If Mr. Li Liewen and the general readership allow more (Free Talk) space for this issue, then perhaps I can discuss it with you in detail, because after such a stimulus, I have developed the ambition to study literature and art. However, until I receive such permission, I can only briefly answer you in a few sentences.</p>
<p>Our conflict is fundamental, which you have stated very simply and clearly in your recent article. You say that my meaning seems to be that (what determines art is that there is first something that has nothing to do with art), yes, I certainly acknowledge this, and this (thing) can also be clearly stated, which is (social existence). Moreover, this is not completely unrelated to art. The two have a decisive relationship between the superstructure and the base structure. According to this view, art is the expression of the given society. But according to your opinion, art is an independent thing. The reality expressed in art is another (reality), unrelated to the socially existing reality. In my view, this is a somewhat mysterious idealistic theory.</p>
<p>I have not said that art is a (completely unchanged, original reproduction) of reality, nor have I placed (artistic expression) in a position secondary to (the knowledge of reality). Only when you exaggerate artistic creative power into something as great as God's creative power, have I comparatively said that it is better to emphasize the knowledge of reality than to emphasize artistic expression. I still think the analogy of (carving a swan) and (painting a tiger) is appropriate. If one wants to paint a tiger like a tiger and carve a swan like a swan, I also believe that recognition and expression must be equally accurate. My intention is to explain that the processes of recognition and expression are different. I believe that recognition precedes expression, and existence precedes recognition. Without existence, there is no way to recognize it, let alone express it. , , it is like interpreting the saying (I think, therefore I am), saying: (Whether Sha Ning and Bazarov have ever existed socially is not the point. The point is whether Sha Ning and Bazarov, as expressed in artistic works, have the possibility of social existence. They are not called imaginary characters because Sha Ning did not exist socially, nor are they called typical characters because Bazarov did exist socially.) Artistic expression can give characters who may not have existed socially the possibility of social existence. This is something I cannot understand no matter how much I think about it, unless I believe that artists are truly God and art is the supreme magic weapon. You have also misinterpreted my method of observation quite a bit. For example, regarding Baoyu, Daiyu, Don Quixote, and Hamlet, according to my view, these all existed socially, but they did not necessarily have the surname Jia or Lin, be knights or princes. Their partial characteristics may not have been entirely like this, but their main points represent one or many real people. It is precisely because of this that they are typical. But you believe that I think that what Cao Xueqin and Shakespeare wrote is all historical truth. I am foolish, but I have not reached that point.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the trivial misunderstandings and misinterpretations regarding individuals, the issue has now become clear after your repeated explanations. It turns out that our opinions are in (conflict) because they start from different standpoints. This makes me very gratified because, in this way, our discussion still has some meaning. Conflict is not a bad thing, as long as it is not blind infighting in the dark. Now, our debate is no longer just a matter between you and me but involves a conflict between two major opposing theories of art, which can also be said to be a conflict between two fundamental principles.</p>
<p>This conflict did not begin today. The issue is actually very old and has been elucidated very clearly, with a conclusion reached among the public. Strictly speaking, the paper and pen we have given to this issue and the space in (Free Talk) has been a bit of a waste.</p>
<p>However, I plan to write another article to seek your advice on how art influences society.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (58)</h3>
<p>— Authored by Maupassant, Translated by Li Zongke</p>
<p>The first young couple to descend ran quickly, when suddenly they saw a stream of clear water flowing from a small hole in the bank wall next to a wooden bench where people rested on the way. Initially, this clear water filled a hollow the size of a washbasin that it had carved out for itself, and then cascaded down as a waterfall only two feet high, escaping through the narrow path overgrown with watercress, and then through the raised plain piled with rocks, disappearing into the brambles and bushes.</p>
<p>("Ah! I'm dying of thirst," Mrs. Lussot cried.)</p>
<p>But how to drink? She tried to cup the water with her hands, but it slipped through her fingers. Jean had an idea. He placed a stone on the path; she knelt on the stone, so she could put her lips to the spring, for when she knelt, her lips were just level with the spring opening. When she raised her head, her face, hair, eyelashes, and clothes were covered with sparkling droplets of water. Jean bent down and said softly to her:</p>
<p>("How beautiful you are!")</p>
<p>She replied in a tone of scolding a child:</p>
<p>("Will you shut my mouth for me?")</p>
<p>These were the first slightly flirtatious words they exchanged.</p>
<p>("Come on," Jean said, flustered, "hurry up, don't let them catch up.")</p>
<p>Indeed, he saw Captain Bocage, whose back was turned as he helped Mama Roland descend by holding her hands, now right behind them. A little higher and a little further away, Roland kept sliding down, shrinking his body into his trousers, crawling on the ground with his hands and feet like a turtle, while Pierre watched his movements in front of him.</p>
<p>The narrow path was not as steep as before; it had now become a sloping road winding around the large piles of rocks that had previously collapsed from the mountain. Mrs. Lussot and Jean began to run, and in a moment they reached the beach. They ran across the beach towards the reefs. These reefs were scattered across a long, flat area covered with seaweed, which shimmered with countless puddles. The receding tide was far away on the other side, with the sea a luminous green and black behind this sticky seaweed-covered plain.</p>
<p>Jean rolled up his trouser legs to his thighs and his sleeves to his elbows, so he could go into the water with confidence, then said: ("Forward!") and resolutely jumped into the first puddle he encountered. The young woman also decided to enter the water immediately, but was more cautious, walking timidly around the small swamp, because she could not stand steadily on the sticky plants.</p>
<p>("Do you see anything?" she said.)</p>
<p>("I see your face reflected in the water.")</p>
<p>("If that's all you see, then you won't have good shrimp catching results.")</p>
<p>He said softly in a gentle voice:</p>
<p>("Ah! I'd rather catch nothing but that.")</p>

<h3>Healthy and Beautiful Women</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>The (Healthy and Beautiful Women), marked with (Mussolini Hitler Awards) of sexual education, and mixed with the promotion of (popularizing the mysterious nude movement) to open the screenings, is said to be a sensation, attracting more than forty to fifty thousand (ladies) audience. Whether this is caused by sexual education or lured by (the mysterious nude movement), in short, women's curves and flesh play a great propaganda role, which is an undeniable fact. It shows that the health and beauty of women in China, promoted by men, has aroused enthusiastic yearning from women.</p>
<p>With healthy and beautiful women, there are happy women's families, with happy families, strong citizens can be produced; and (with the family harmonious, the country is well-governed), this enables men to be steadfast and dedicated to public service, all industries flourish, and politics is on track, and the way to China's independence and freedom lies here! This is the declaration of the advocates of healthy and beautiful women. This and the proposers of grand openings for sports meets and national martial arts competitions reveal that (with a strong body, there is a strong career, and a healthy nation, which is enough to defend against the enemy), which is equally (forceful). It seems that the delicate, slender, and weak Zhuo Wenjun and Lin Daiyu are the root cause of the current loss of land and should not be swept away with great fanfare. However, although this women's health and beauty movement advocated by men and supported by women is undoubtedly vigorous, it is necessary to (review) the location of its abuses and the implications of the era.</p>
<p>The current (modern) girls clearly regard these imported words (healthy and beautiful) as increasing women's status like love, divorce, and freedom, and become women's infinite glory to accept. If someone praises a certain woman for having healthy beauty, it becomes her worthy of boasting and proud talent, but from another aspect of practical investigation, going to the cinema to see Hollywood's thighs and breasts, seeing white Russian women on Avenue Joffre exposing trembling nipples, the literati who advocate healthy beauty are drooling in praise: Western women are rich in healthy beauty; gentry and wealthy merchants who have special hobbies, a visit to the Japanese (residence) in Hongkou, a stroll in the foreign young women's (massage parlors) in the French Concession, and after a large feast over the butcher shop, also twirling their whiskers and licking their lips in admiration: (Foreigners' physique) is ultimately different. However, remaining flowers and defeated willows can never satisfy, and when they return to the hall full of wives and concubines who are literary and frail and prone to sorrow, they also feel disappointed, saying that Chinese people's bodies are too thin and weak and cannot be done, so (advocating health and beauty). This has become (health and beauty) not for women to improve their social status and develop women's careers, but for women to promote it themselves; instead, it has become a phenomenon of men promoting and touting it to satisfy their carnal desires. Therefore, the (health and beauty) movement that should increase women's status and career, in this (upside-down situation), in addition to increasing many (vases) (anti-aircraft guns) (tanks) (standard beauties) and star socialites in shops and institutions, does not see any benefit to women.</p>
<p>Some people say: The life of feudal society is static, so men's demand for female beauty is delicate, elegant, chaste, and quiet, and the life of capitalist society is dynamic and adventurous, so Boer men demand strong and lively female beauty. This is the (reason why) (health and beauty) is popular among women, but this view is not necessarily (to the point). The reason is that the current Chinese society is under internal and external troubles, and its life does not necessarily (move) out of any future, and (adventure) is not its wish, nor can it be done. Under the worry of (peace) and (appeasement), the future has already been decided, so (when you get wine, drink it, and when you get romance, enjoy it), enjoy, enjoy, and the third is still enjoy. George Bernard Shaw described Napoleon as saying (the British always have to say a great truth), why are we not clever: so instead of (sensuality) (curvaceous beauty) (nude movement), promoting women's sports and developing women's (health and beauty) movement is thus performed.</p>
<p>However, it is far from what our cynical ladies should take to avoid eating due to choking and concealing diseases, and a strong (health is beauty) body is indeed needed by our country's women, only paying attention to the (health and beauty movement) of women in terms of environment and individual; one, to temper their bodies under the purpose of seeking their own independence, increasing women's social status, and developing their careers, and to promote the (health and beauty) movement initiated by women themselves; two, to make a (liberation) of thought in themselves, not to use (health and beauty) as a means to achieve (certain ambitions) of women, and of course, to refute the tricks of those men who intend to promote women's (health and beauty) to achieve (certain ambitions).</p>
<p>In this way, perhaps the (women's health and beauty movement) that men appreciate and play with can be seized from the hands of men and become a (women's health and beauty movement) to fight for themselves and society. Perhaps only then can (healthy and beautiful women) be used as data for film theaters to make shocking advertising propaganda for (sexual education) and (popularizing the mysterious nude movement).</p>
<h3>Struggling Like This</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>It is said that the current circle of life is extremely narrow, so that even college students who are equivalent to the former Hanlin scholars and successful candidates often have no way out, so you can't help but wander in the land of hunger, and even some get angry for a while and can't sleep at night, and must take some sleeping pills; near the river, the rumbling stomach screams wildly, the heels start to soften, and turbid water can also fill the stomach, so they jump into the river; as for college students becoming kidnappers and robbing on the road, that is the business of heroes; even if they engage in low-level jobs, pulling rickshaws and serving as special duty personnel, it is still so-so, and cannot be said to be a good way.</p>
<p>Naturally, I should be even more unlucky, because I have not yet graduated from college.</p>
<p>However, I am reluctant to die, and I am unwilling to casually engage in low-level jobs, and I still want to struggle.</p>
<p>However, I don't know how to struggle.</p>
<p>So I went to consult Mr. Ge, who is (extremely proficient in this way).</p>
<p>Mr. Ge was originally just a college graduate, but he had indeed gone through a vigorous struggle, and is now in the ranks of success. He did not treasure and hide his secrets. Perhaps my attitude of asking for advice was sincere, and he gave me very detailed guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Ge said that the method is very complicated, but it is also very simple. In every way, if it is used properly, it can be roughly divided into two periods: in school and after graduation, which are the two major journeys and two major steps of struggle.</p>
<p>Some people say that when you are in school, you can be sloppy with your studies. This is a mistake. It should be that you can perfunctorily deal with your studies. Perfunctorily is different from sloppy. Sloppy is openly messing things up, and perfunctorily is a way to relax yourself without damaging your reputation. For example, reading a foreign language and saying that you want to use it to read books and translate is completely unnecessary. Just learn to speak fluently and be able to open your mouth. As for the way, I once put in a lot of hard work. I put aside other subjects and ran to the tree every morning to practice pronunciation. As a result, at the English essay competition, the principal personally presented me with a large silver shield, and I used two familiar English sentences to thank him. I am disappointed in class, but to be honest, I am watching movie descriptions or writing love letters, and I also hand in homework, which I have prepared to entrust to others. In this way, in terms of academics, teachers all say that I am very hardworking, but in fact, I have spared a lot of free time to participate in various societies, to chat and socialize with teachers, and to participate in political movements outside the school. Before graduation, the principal first invited me to help at the XX organization.</p>
<p>After graduation, the scope of the struggle is broader. So in my spare time, the first step is to devote myself to writing and temporarily compile a (Collection of Famous Sayings). I spent a little money to print it myself, and after it was printed, I began to give it away. I gave a copy to all famous people, and attached a letter, talking about the old days and asking for advice, nothing more than saying that I had been taught in person, and I was fortunate to have three lives. Now I have compiled a book and I hope that you will not hesitate to correct it. After the book was widely given away, I often said that a certain mayor is my friend, and a certain doctor is also my friend, and so on. All the bureau chiefs and section chiefs are my friends. So, I spent some money and held a big banquet for the reporters. After this, my reputation gradually increased. There is a vacancy here that needs me to go, and there is a place that says that it can't be done without my help. On the contrary, I feel that I can't cope with it.</p>
<p>There is no need to say more about the subtleties, and Mr. Ge stopped talking here.</p>
<h3>Marconi Goes Childless</h3>
<p>— Li Yue</p>
<p>A few days ago, Marconi, the pioneer of radio, came to Shanghai. The people of Shanghai welcomed this Italian who invented this new 20th-century novelty with great enthusiasm, just like welcoming other foreigners. In addition to formal welcomes and meetings, radio magazines also issued special issues for this Italian old man with unfamiliar faces, and major newspapers also made comments praising him. Everyone unanimously called him a (meritorious contributor to human happiness).</p>
<p>A meritorious contributor to human happiness! Indeed, it is said that this scientist who has made such a great contribution to human culture is worthy of being called a (meritorious contributor to human happiness). However, unfortunately! This new educational tool that is said to (contribute to culture) has had a very small impact on the toiling masses who are struggling to survive under the iron whip of life, and has received very little favor from it: not only that, but the impression and response of the toiling masses to this new tool is simply annoyance and cursing! Let's see, when friends who are racking their brains or brothers who are dripping with sweat are working hard in the middle of the night to create their food for tomorrow in the side room, or after finishing their heavy work like cows and horses during the day, they are hiding in the (attic) to seek quiet rest, the new educational tool that (contributes to culture) is also starting to become active at this time. First, it plays the strings leisurely, then it gradually becomes loud, and finally it becomes a crazy roar: irritating music, sad cries, and the sounds of ballads, storytelling, and chanting sutras... vibrate the quiet air of the deep night, deeply striking the hearts of the owners of the side room or attic, who are immersed in the encirclement of this irritating and ear-piercing sound wave, the ink in the inkstone is dry, and not a single word can be written! Turning over and over again, their bones ache, but they still can't get a moment of quiet rest! So they feel unbearably annoyed by it and begin to curse it mercilessly. What can be used to cover this up? This new tool that (contributes to culture) has become a new type of entertainment toy privately owned by people with leisure. What can actually cover this up?</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Italian old man who invented this new type of toy came to Shanghai. Not many days later, he left Shanghai again. The newspaper reported that on the day before leaving Shanghai, he expressed his delight at the banquet held by the Shanghai dignitaries to see him off that the international radio station purchased wireless radio equipment from (Marconi Company). He also said that although he does not speak Chinese, he feels that the sound of Chinese language is quite pleasant... I suspect that he had ever strolled on the road or lingered for a few minutes by the sugar-fried chestnut stalls and fruit shops? If he had experienced it, how (delighted) he would have been, he would have laughed so hard that the old man's presbyopic eyes would have narrowed and he couldn't open them, and he would have been dry and unable to close his mouth!</p>
<h3>A Friend Suffering from Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Ling Ling</p>
<p>Recently, a friend came to Shanghai specifically to treat lung disease because there are no good doctors in the countryside. I haven't seen him for five or six years, and there is an unspeakable joy in reuniting after a long separation. Both of us have lost some weight over the years, especially him, who has lost a lot of weight. We almost didn't recognize each other when we met. Recalling the five or six years of running around for food and clothing, one day, I accompanied him to XX Hospital.</p>
<p>The doctor said that an X-ray would be needed to determine the extent of the lung disease.</p>
<p>The next day, we went to wait for a reply. The doctor said: (You need to be hospitalized.) My friend asked him: (How long will I need to be hospitalized?) The doctor said: (One year.)</p>
<p>My friend couldn't help but be stunned. Because according to his estimate, he could go out after a few weeks at most, and he is still at a loss as to how deep the lung disease is.</p>
<p>So I asked the doctor: (Then how badly has the harmful lung disease damaged him?) The doctor said: (This cannot be said. In short, according to the current symptoms, hospitalization for one year is a must. You can think for yourself about how far the disease has progressed.) But he whispered to me (at this time, my friend happened to walk out of the door) (the disease is already very deep, (you see,)) he pointed to the X-ray photo in his hand and said to me: (This left lung has been completely damaged, and the right lung has also been damaged a little, but it doesn't matter yet. What can be hoped for now is only this right lung.)</p>
<p>I was shocked.</p>
<p>(Then.) I said, (Mr. C, you must be hospitalized.)</p>
<p>(But, I still have many things to do in the countryside,) he said slowly, (I have to go back and take care of them before coming back... Besides, there is also the problem of money.)</p>
<p>The doctor said that it would be best to be hospitalized immediately today. If more time is wasted, the condition of the disease will inevitably change, and the original photo can no longer be used as a standard for how to start treatment.</p>
<p>Mr. C still couldn't make a decision. In the end, he said, (I will go back tomorrow and come back the day after tomorrow.) The doctor said, (Good, but I hope you come sooner.)</p>
<p>Mr. C went back.</p>
<p>Three days, four days, five days, Mr. C still didn't come. What is the reason? Is it a problem of money? No, Mr. C said that at least one or two hundred yuan could be raised first; could it be that the incident could not be dealt with clearly for a while? It shouldn't be...</p>
<p>On the eighth day, a letter from another friend came. He said: Mr. C originally planned to come to Shanghai on the fourth day, but because of his father's opposition, he has not yet made the trip. His father's reasons for opposition are that he is reluctant to spend money and that Western medicine is unreliable. Therefore, Mr. C is still waiting in the countryside.) Finally, he added, (In my opinion, I am afraid that Mr. C will not come to Shanghai for medical treatment again.)</p>
<p>That's the way it is. It doesn't matter to lose your life for money. What else is there to say? I couldn't help but feel sad about it!</p>

<p>— Qu Chen</p>
<p>(Late winter, late bottom...Be careful of fire...Close the gates of the lane...Prop up the gates of the lane...)</p>
<p>(Strike... Strike... Strike...)</p>
<p>In the silent night, an old and heavy voice came from the church, and it suddenly dawned on me that the time had passed the beginning of winter.</p>
<p>Because of this voice, it aroused even more the emotion of homesickness.</p>
<p>In the countryside, there are unavoidable sounds to miss. Such as the birds of spring, the frogs of summer, the insects of autumn, and the crowing of chickens and the barking of dogs on winter nights, all of which are rich in poetic and artistic conception. Thinking of them will make people yearn for them. Striking the clapper is also one of them.</p>
<p>Whenever the night is quiet and there is no breeze, the sound of the clapper and gong, evenly one after another from afar, spreads from the boundless air, spreading out until it reaches your pillow, making you feel like you are in a majestic and ancient fortress, and you can't help but be moved by the beauty of this quiet and slightly desolate meaning and start to imagine.</p>
<p>If it is in a foreign land, it is an excellent medium to guide your dreams back to your hometown. Try to open the poetry collection of the past dynasties and check it. (Diao Dou), (Night Watch Drum), (Sound of Leaking Water), this kind of cracking sound has touched the hearts of many poets!</p>
<p>The original meaning of striking the clapper may not be like this. But we have no official duties or wealth, so we don't have to memorize words like (heavily guarded gates and striking clappers to wait for violent guests). Even if there are violent guests, they are brought in by our own pens, and cannot be guarded by (heavily guarded gates and striking clappers). We are just appreciators. Beethoven's symphony is of course pleasing to the ear, but in the feeling of a poet, the simple sound of striking the clapper is not necessarily below the world-famous (Moonlight Sonata). Sound is such a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>I have been drifting outside for years. Although I occasionally return, it has been a long time since I heard the sound of striking the clapper in my hometown. Tonight I heard it, and it was as if I had returned to my hometown. Thank the clapper striker for his diligent guidance every night.</p>

<p>The preparation bell has rung. The air is extremely tense, like going to the battlefield and facing a great enemy. The number of people attending is sufficient. The usually calm classroom suddenly presents a noisy scene, almost making latecomers feel disappointed like (full), (I can't get in, brother). This is for the exam. But, once the difficult hurdle is over, the situation changes quickly; scattered, there are empty seats on the left and empty seats on the right.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (18)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>The 29th Night of the Month</p>
<p>My heart, which had finally understood everything, has once again been disturbed and left without a master. My forehead still throbs faintly as I try desperately to recall the scene of Miss Min and Miss Hui meeting, and every possible comparison floods my mind. Miss Hui rejected my confession but accepted Miss Min’s explanation; what kind of understanding did their conversation bring about regarding me? Although Miss Min couldn’t withstand my uncle's pressure, she paid attention to my actions and fled to Shanghai at the same time. There's no need to argue, her intentions are so clear. Yesterday’s explanation to Miss Hui was also a humble gesture. Miss Hui was my childhood companion, our (love) grew from childhood, but in my grandmother's eyes, she was born and raised a country girl, and in recent years she has drifted too far from me. It is a fact that I am dissatisfied with my uncle, just as it is a fact that my uncle is dissatisfied with me. It is also a fact that I am dissatisfied with Miss Hui’s deeply ingrained urban habits. That day, after returning from the French Park with Miss Min, I wrote her a long letter, telling her that although I was a young man born in the 20th century, my mind was still so corrupt. This time I left my family, wanting to delve into society and experience some suffering. I will never follow the trends of the times, and now we have gathered a group of fools, doing what smart people consider the most foolish things. After sending it, I regretted the harsh wording, thinking it was so wrong to hurt the heart of my childhood companion, Miss Hui. But because I was busy with community affairs, I just regretted it and forgot about the letter I had sent, which could not be retrieved. Yesterday, Miss Hui suddenly came to the community, and I had already anticipated that something unusual was happening. When I saw her completely changed appearance, I felt even deeper remorse. Miss Hui had transformed from her terrible environment; she had accepted the advice in my letter. But she heard Xiao Huang’s unintentional (love triangle). A woman's heart is so narrow, she left resolutely, and today she even rejected my confession. However, Miss Min, who had closed her door and cried yesterday, was able to run to Xujiahui to explain everything clearly... I looked at the mottled ceiling, my entire mind swirling with these questions. A heart that had finally understood everything was as chaotic as a pan of loose sand.</p>
<p>The clothes on my back were stuck to the bedding with sweat. I pressed my hand to my forehead, feeling a little cooler, but my throat was still dry. I struggled to sit up, supporting my unsteady body to the table, but the thermos was empty. So, I shuffled to the window in my slippers. The sky was clear, and the moonlight streamed through the glass window so beautifully. I haven't seen such lovely moonlight, living in darkness, for who knows how long. Forgetting my illness, and dragging my cluttered thoughts, I pushed open the window, savoring the light that the moonlight gave me. Sitting, sitting, in a silence where everything seemed dead, I was unaware of my own existence. I vaguely heard the noisy chirping of small crows. As dawn approached, I felt my limbs, all ice-cold, and at the same time, my heart was at peace. I closed the window, staggered back to the bed, and laughed at myself, having not slept well all night, yet worrying about these things!</p>

<h3>The Love Story of Norma Shearer (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>(2) First Meeting with Irving Thalberg</p>
<p>Norma closed her diary, involuntarily sighing. She suddenly thought of someone, Irving Thalberg. He was far away in Hollywood, yet he saw her shadow somewhere and took notice of her, and even called the Eastern office to find her. (I should thank him), she thought. She immediately wrote him a very simple letter and mailed it. But from then on, she was busy every day working as a model here and there, and as an extra in this and that film company. Thalberg's name gradually faded, eventually disappearing from her mind. After several weeks like this, a letter suddenly arrived from far away Hollywood, delivered to the hands of a Canadian woman in New York. It was sent by a newly organized company in Hollywood, called Louis B. Mayer Company. The letter stated that they could give her six months of work, with the company responsible for all travel expenses to Hollywood. Norma looked at the words Louis B. Mayer Company printed on the letterhead. Although she didn't know who owned the company, she felt very willing to give it a try. At the time, she didn't know that Thalberg was the general manager of the new company. One morning, Norma Shearer and her mother had already arrived in the warm California from the frigid eastern New York. They got off the train, but no one came to pick them up. This petite woman, wearing a newly made blue dress, held a small leather bag tightly in one hand, the contract inside, and held her mother with the other. They walked out of the station, jumped on a streetcar, and were sped away to Hollywood.</p>
<p>The morning after she arrived in Hollywood, she hurried to the large film company in Culver City. The female staff member at the information desk told her that she should see Mr. Thalberg, the general manager. She left the information desk and met a young man in the hallway. The young man asked her, (Can I help you?) She shyly said, (Yes. My name is Norma Shearer, I just arrived yesterday. They told me to see Mr. Thalberg, the general manager. Can you please tell me where he is?) The young man heard this and found it very interesting. He said, (Okay, Miss Shearer, please follow me), and she followed him to a very, very large room with a large glass-topped desk in the middle. When they arrived, the young man pulled out a chair for Norma and said, (Please have a seat).</p>
<p>She sat down, thinking to herself, (Hmm, this is a very considerate</p>
<p>Office Boy, or maybe he's a Clerk. No matter what he is, he's a very thoughtful person). As she thought this, she suddenly asked the young man loudly, (I don't know what kind of person Thalberg is. Can you please tell me? I think he must be a very arrogant person. Maybe he has a big, red face, a long, hooked nose, and a thick, big cigar in his mouth. Is that right?) The young man laughed and said, (Well, what you've said is not quite right. Thalberg may be somewhat like what you imagine, but in any case, he doesn't have a thick, big cigar in his mouth. How do I know? Because – look – my name is Thalberg, Irving Thalberg!)</p>
<p>Norma Shearer heard this and fell to the floor, her small leather bag rolling away with her. Thalberg was still smiling, and he slowly walked behind the large desk and sat down. He said, (Miss Shearer, let's talk business, haven't we already been formally introduced?) Norma got up from the floor, picked up her bag, and gradually regained her composure. Then everyone laughed, one sitting in the chair, the other behind the desk. They laughed very happily, because they were both full of humorous thoughts. From that moment on, their hearts were already in tune. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of *Don Quixote*</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>- Nanjing Screening -</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Although the first word of the title is "Review," I only want to write about the story in this article, to fulfill my responsibility of explaining and introducing it to the readers. As for everything else, I'll leave it to friendly experts to make more detailed introductions.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Don Quixote is the title of a novel, which is also the name of the protagonist in the novel. This novel originated in Spain at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and up to now, it can be said to be popular all over the world. Previously, someone adapted it into a stage play, and now it has been brought to the screen from the novel.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>In sixteenth-century France, chivalric novels were very popular. Similarly, in early seventeenth-century Spain, chivalric novels were gradually gaining people's appreciation and love.</p>
<p>At this time, the class of Spanish petty nobles declined with the decline of the feudal system. At the same time, the gradual development of capitalist culture in the cities was also the reason for their decline. Afterwards, they were transformed into the intellectual class of various classes. When this phenomenon was expressed in literature, on the one hand, it vigorously attacked the dying knight class, its culture, ideals, poetry, etc., and on the other hand, it used the last rays of light to surround the image of the knight who had become a (shadow of the past). (Frederich's (History of the Development of European Literature)) Thus, *Don Quixote* came into being at this time.</p>
<p>We know that the author of this novel, Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616), was a contemporary of Shakespeare. He loved to read books about the adventures of warriors. He was a man of perseverance, an opponent who refused to be oppressed. When he was nearly fifty years old, he collected taxes from nobles, but the nobles refused to pay by force and imprisoned him. And this large book of more than 400,000 words was written by him in the poor iron window life. It was first published in 1605.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>I don't want to introduce his life in detail here, but I must explain that this novel is completely a reflection of his own life and thoughts.</p>
<p>Cervantes' novels, whether in terms of the form of the novel, the sketch of the protagonist, or the ideology, are all (parodies) of the knight class. The protagonist loves to read chivalric novels and decides to show the great achievements of the ancient knights. So he fantasized about a beautiful lady for himself, found a disciple, and rode on horseback to explore adventure. But all his great achievements, like himself, are completely a kind of comic. He regarded windmills as giants, sheep flocks as armies, and inns as castles. However, everything did not have good results. Everything was not as beneficial as he imagined. On the contrary, there were some real harms. For example, he rescued the shepherd boy who was cruelly beaten by his master, but instead made the shepherd boy suffer more beatings (not in the movie). He liberated a group of slaves who were being escorted to warships to row, but was thrown with stones by the slaves. … As a result, ordinary people all ran away from this dangerous and stubborn protector, and prayed to heaven to kill him and other knights at the same time. This is the same as Faust's saving the world, but being burned to death by the people. This knight's sorrow of the benefactor will always surround our hearts.</p>
<p>The author gave Mr. Quixote a comical nature, and at the same time made him an idealist. The author understands the death of chivalric customs and ideals on the one hand, but emotionally defends this last bearer. This is the so-called mockery in love or the love seen in mockery, that is, knowledge with tears or tears with laughter.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>In short, Cervantes buried the world of knights and the literature of knights with ridicule on the one hand, but at the same time, Cheng Bugao wrote and directed the new film *With Common Hatred*. Wang Ying and Xie Yunqing. used the radiance of poetry to surround his own (sad image of the dying knight).</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>We understand the author in this way, and analyze (Don Quixote) in this way, so let's review the protagonist in this movie now.</p>
<p>Of course, under the creativity of Pabst, he will not change the original form of the novel. Naturally, the entire novel cannot be brought to the screen, but only organic links can be made to the summary. In some places, he exaggerated a certain part of the book, and at the same time abandoned certain parts. The order of before and after is reversed, and several events are combined into one. - Because the film has its own dramatic peculiarities, it is necessary to change the form of the song. If you follow the original book, regardless of the drama of the movie, it is naturally the most stupid thing, why bother adapting it. For example, attacking the windmill is in the front part of the novel, but in the movie it is used as the final climax. Quixote was tricked back, and the burning of the book was also a previous event, but in the movie, he watches the burning of the book and dies, which is such a clever success in the movie! When we see the burnt novel become a (Don Quixote), it explains the eternity of his spirit.</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>In short, I hope that the audience will not regard him as a The sorrow of a protagonist.</p>
<h3>Review of *A History of Blood and Tears in Jehol*</h3>
<p>— Lvyi</p>
<p>At a time when public morale is gradually declining, the release of *A History of Blood and Tears in Jehol*, which uses the anti-Japanese Jehol volunteer army as its theme, is not necessarily a stimulant. If the actual situation at that time could be vividly brought to the screen in a planned way, the audience would be able to further understand the loss of Jehol. On the other hand, it could also preserve part of the historical facts. But, what does *A History of Blood and Tears in Jehol* tell us? It only stereotypically introduced the voices and smiles of a few so-called national heroes; it only introduced the actions of a few troops in a scattered manner; it only shouted anti-Japanese slogans in the subtitles. This is not a story, because a story should develop coherently from beginning to end; this is not even historical fact, because historical fact should show the causes of the outbreak and failure of the war.</p>
<p>This film, apart from the word "History" in the title not matching the content, the other two words "Blood" and "Tears" are also exaggerated. If the actual situation of the anti-Japanese war of the Jehol volunteer army is told, it is indeed a blood and tears exchange, but the mood shown on the screen does not conform to the meaning of the two words "(Blood and Tears)". The difficult and arduous battlefield life of the volunteer army is not introduced enough.</p>
<p>However, I have to say this: Although the film itself disappoints us, the motive and spirit of Huichong Company in producing this film are worthy of our admiration.</p>
<h3>Don't Neglect Eyebrows</h3>
<p>— Yan Zuxin</p>
<p>Chinese movie actresses neglect the makeup of their eyebrows when playing peasant girls and poor women. For example, in *Little Toys*, when (Sister-in-law Ye) (played by Ruan Lingyu) lost her family and wandered the streets, selling toys, although she was wearing ragged clothes, draped a burlap bag over her shoulders, and her face fully expressed the hardship of wandering and displacement, her eyebrows were still drawn as thin as willow leaves. Isn't this unreasonable? So I hope that our actresses will pay more attention to the eyebrows when putting on makeup in the future, so that they are consistent with the identity of the character in the play, and don't think that this is a small place and neglect it!

<h3>Lianhua Colleagues' Party Decides to Hold It on the 17th of This Month</h3>
<p>It was previously reported that Lianhua Film Company colleagues originally planned to hold a party on the 6th of this month inside Lianhua First Factory. However, as of yesterday, there was still no movement. After inquiring with the person in charge of the association, it was said that the factory's work has been quite tense recently, and the entertainment aspects of the party itself also need to be fully prepared. In addition, the venue was originally scheduled for Lianhua First Factory, and it was deeply feared that the number of attendees would be too large temporarily, and the venue would not be sufficient, which would hinder order. Therefore, it has been temporarily postponed. According to the results of the association's consultation, it is planned to change the venue to Lianhua Second Film Factory on Kang Nao Road for the conference venue, so that it can be arranged in a leisurely manner to do its best to make guests feel at home. The conference date has been set for the 17th of this month from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, so that various entertainment programs can be fully rehearsed and proficiently performed. All measures are intended to make the conference even more colorful. (Quechou)</p>
<h3>Letter of Request</h3>
<p>To Mr. Zhong Huiqin: I see that your translation of the film novel *Deep Love of Flowers* was originally published in the American film magazine *ScreenR*. Special reply from editor Bai.</p>
<h3>Film Novel *Little Women* (9)</h3>
<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>Mr. March began to speak. He said, (The doctor said I could go home to rest, but if it weren't for John Brooke, how could I go home. John said, where did everyone go? So everyone turned around and realized that John and Laurie had already left. Mr. March continued, (Even a biological son wouldn't be more filial. But I don't want to talk, I want to see your faces, the dear people I think about day and night). So everyone huddled close to him. Amy sat at his feet, with Meg and Jo on one side, and Mommy on the other, with Beth's head resting on her father's shoulder. This was the sweetest reunion, undreamed of for months.</p>
<p>At this moment, Jo's eyes suddenly looked at Meg's face, secretly hating her: Such a happy family, could she intend to destroy it by marrying that John Brooke? Later, Meg was alone in the living room, as if waiting for a guest. Jo walked up to her and begged her, (Meg, why do you want to leave? Why can't we stay together all the time and go get married?) Meg said, (Who said that? I don't want to get married. If you're talking about Brooke, he hasn't proposed to me either. If he proposes to me, I can tell him it's too soon). Jo happily hugged her sister and said, (That's the best thing. Now that father is back, aren't we happier than ever?) The doorbell rang. Jo quickly let go of her hand and walked upstairs, reminding her sister again before going upstairs not to forget what she had just said. Meg went to open the door, and Brooke came in. They talked for a while, and Brooke did indeed start to propose to Meg. He took her hand. But she withdrew it. She shyly recited the paragraph she had just prepared in a messy way, but Brooke said, (I can wait. I can endure all the hard work and wait for a long time, I just need a hope, that in the end I will get a reward. Can you not give me a glimmer of hope?) He begged with deep affection. Meg said in a low voice, (I'm afraid I can't). Pain darkened his eyes. He asked tightly, (Really? Is that what you mean?)</p>
<p>Meg hadn't been able to answer him yet when the door opened and Aunt came in. Brooke saw the terrible old woman and quietly retreated. Aunt looked at Meg with sharp eyes and said, (What is that Lawrence tutor doing here?) Meg quickly stopped her and said, (Shh... don't let him hear, he's my father's benefactor!) (What? Your father's benefactor? If he doesn't come to harass you, he's your father's benefactor. I'm thinking of you. You should marry a rich man. That Brooke is a poor man with no status in society!) Meg protested. She said, (It doesn't necessarily mean he won't have money or status in society his whole life). The old woman was extremely angry and said, (Oh, he's thinking about my money then. Okay, I'll tell you, miss…) Meg was furious and raised her voice, (Aunt, you don't need to say that! My John is definitely not marrying for money. We don't want your money either. We can work. We're not afraid of being poor...) She didn't go on, because she suddenly remembered what she had just said to John. But her aunt was still talking incessantly, (Miss, listen to me, if you marry this Hawke, Locke, or Crock, don't expect to get a penny from me!) (To be continued)</p>
