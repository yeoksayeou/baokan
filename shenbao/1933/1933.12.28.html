<p>時評</p>
<h3>敎育與農村（舒）</h3>
<p>敎育之根本涵義。第一在培養各個受敎育者之德性。第二在積蓄深䆳之知識。凡曾受高等敎育之人。必爲一般社會之領導。其言行智力。均將影響於社會之整個動向。我國輸入歐化。興辦新敎育。迄今已數十年。於近代文明之推進。國家前途之貢獻。雖不能謂爲絶無。而其實效則甚鮮。吾人試考查全中國各地各機關。莫不有人才缺乏眞才難得之慨。同時敎育界失業之人。又遍地皆是。用非所學。到處皆然。專門人才不足之歎聲。往往出諸負責者之口。此種矛盾現象。其然豈其然耶。</p>
<p>我國敎育之未嘗普及。已爲舉世所公認。無容隱諱。農村中不識字之人。平均在百分之九十五以上。即交通發達略具近代工業組織之都市。一般文化水凖。亦甚低微。此固曾受高等敎育之人所應負之重責也。但據近頃敎育部所派遣視察上海六大學之專員報告。對精神敎育之考語。大都爲「大多數習於奢侈繁華。……體態則趨於柔靡。……」惟大面大學則屬於僅少例外之「比較僕素。」果爾。則今日中國之敎育現象。與來日擔當國家社會重任之青年。其危殆爲何如乎。設使舉國如此。則中國民族之日即衰頽。可立而待。試問其關係何等重大。我國自歷史遺傳而來之習慣。讀書爲做官。似乎讀書人之前途。祇有做官一條路可走。新近自由主義思想從歐洲輸入而後。做官思想乃有逐漸轉變爲經營工商業之傾向。惟此種工商業之經營。又多積中於大都市。而敎育界之對於工商業學識。又未能精深研究。從切實需要之途猛進。</p>
<p>就實際形勢之推移論。我國大都市之發達。主要原因不在乎產業之發達。而在商業之轉輸。現在我國城市。幾爲純粹外國製造品之消售所。此類繁榮。其基礎已極脆弱。况復流行投機。其所爲一切。多等於空頭之進出。非特於產業無關。即於整個國民經濟之建設。亦不相涉。此種情勢。倘使世界經濟恐慌之狂潮一至。自己即絶無絲毫撑持之力。金融資本。雖正向上發展。結果祇有同受震撼。聽隨其自然之變動而已。以城市發達爲中心之敎育。其所養成之智力。亦因城市經濟衰落而民其萎靡。至於品性之涵養。道德之培殖。更無暇論。如長此不加改革。恐我國敎育。亦將與殖民地經濟同樣陷落也。</p>
<p>我國立國之根本在農業。雖近代工業。略見發展。然其歷史傳統之根柢與經濟組織之基礎。當非短時期内所能改換。且各先進工業國。如英吉利。如德意志亦尙力國經濟的自給自足。於農業經營。絶不鬆懈。我國本爲原料輸出國家。又烏可於此時自餒而不謀所以適應農村之道耶。夫欲謀所以適應農村之道。其樞機全在敎育。故我國今日之敎育方針。除力圖普及敎育之實施外。應力矯舊習。務使敎育課程。適切於農村之需要。并須注意於曾受敎育之人。如何而能回鄉工作。如此則頻於危境之敎育與農村。有更生之機。失業痛苦亦可逐漸解决。</p>
<p>專門敎育雖性質不同。其所造就之人才。將來出路。亦不必在農村。似乎對農村無須注意。不過在我國現時情勢之下。任何事業。均不能與頻於破產之經濟形態脫離關係。故至少對今日之農村經濟。應具眞確之認識。體騐農民之苦况。發爲獻身社會之精神。於其本身事業前途始有希望。而於國民敎育亦有意義。是以欲挽救敎育上之危機。須恢復青年人之元氣。在學校敎育除智識修養外。德性陶冶。更不可忽視。我國農民之樸厚忠實。確爲擔當大任之主要條件。且其忍苦耐勞。堅毅不屈。雖經長時日而仍舊繼續努力。此種農民之美　。實應貫注於青年學子行動之中。此在敎育上不可不注意者也。總之偏重城市敎育。已顯露種種弊竇。挽救之道。第一應輸進農民之樸厚性質。以濟現時澆薄之窮。第二增進農民之知識學藝。以謀農村經濟之進展。</p>

<h3>贛皖湘鄂視察記（本報特派員任安）</h3>
<p>宿松太湖之農村狀况</p>
<p>太湖通信、由黃梅入皖、首抵宿松、兩地相距僅四十里、農村狀况大同小異、租錢亦須預繳、上好之田、且納租金、土地較集中、全縣有租五千担至一萬担者、數近十家、地瀕江湖、易遭水災、華洋義賑會、在該地所辦信用合作社、貨金年利四厘、社員限於易被水災之農民、目的似專在賑濟水災、婦女纒足風甚盛、鄉下尤多全未解放者、烟賭表面雖係嚴禁、而暗地違犯者亦甚多、</p>
<p>縣城曾被其匪佔據三星期、富户豪紳、損失頗大、嗣爲國軍擊退、城鄉均得安堵如故、地方自治機關公務人員、多染惡習、對經濟則公私不分、對公務多委卸不前、致連任縣長、所欲興辦之建設事項、均成紙上空談、如歷年修築堤防、皆用巨欵、連年水災、仍所不免、當事人之不負責、甚且貪汚、鄉民偶語及之、無不破口大駡、農村經濟、枯竭萬分、市面及四鄉所流通之金融、大都爲商家、所發之錢票、是項錢票之發行、漫無限制、凡一商家、甚或飯舖·茶館、均可自由發行、郵局則拒絶收受、其他則受環境包圍、無不勉强通用、陶縣長爲整理金融計、頗欲取締是項錢票、終以金融枯涸、未克實現、錢莊對外不能以信用國劃、必須以現金國劃、而國兌業、比前特殊增加、此亦畸形之怪狀也、</p>
<p>全縣所產食米、平年不足、仰給鄰縣運入約二萬石、輸外雜糧和小麥、約八萬至十萬石、銷路爲九江·鎭江·上海·等處、特產有濱江之瓜子、濱湖之銀魚·烟業·皆見稱於世、</p>
<p>北上抵太湖縣、安徽一區專員無公署在焉、聞專員到任不久、對於禁烟、頗爲認眞、四城貼有犯者槍决之佈告、故無明目張胆公開吸食之人、似一大好景象也、惟初到任時、帶人太多、無法位置、適值烟禁森嚴、乃遍委以檢查烟犯之職、奈中有不良分子、暗懷烟具、前往檢查、若遇忠厚可欺之家、縱無犯罪行爲、亦必出所帶烟具、誣爲證物、恫嚇索賄、民甚苦之、猶幸覺察之日甚早、爲害尙淺、</p>
<p>縣府前爲政費緊迫、曾發一種「印收」（意即債劵之類）、分一元·二元·三元·五元·四種、由糧户以現金預先購買、秋後可用完糧、及至秋征開始、縣府又以現金缺乏、條諭征櫃、「印收」繳糧、只暫收一半、其餘半數仍收現金、糧户無法、只好遵辦、惟所持「印收」、均爲整票、無法折兌、持請征櫃找補、則云縣府原無現金、概加拒絶、延恐逾限受罰、故多備全數現金、如期完繳、不料突聞該項「印收」、立將失效之謠、同時、反有願以折扣購買「印收」之商號、應運而生、一般持有「印收」之糧户、多係無知鄉愚、正苦「印收」無用、突聞可賣消息、無不爭先恐後、各以較低價格、亟亟出售、難受巨大損失、亦所弗計、然該商號敢突買此項「印收」、自然别有奥妙存在也、</p>
<p>各鄉農民、自耕者頗少、佃耕者最多、佃户辦法、一爲須納押板金（即押租）者、名曰「保莊」、不納者曰「清莊」、押板金多少無定、大致每石田、納二十元至三十元、轉佃權、保莊有之、清莊則無、所納租數、多係臨時决定、普通主佃所佔成分、保莊者主四佃六、清莊者主六佃四、退佃、若是清莊、互可隨便、若在保莊、先自地主提議、須有特别原因、退回全部押板金、並徴得佃户同意時、始可辦到、否則佃户若無短欠情事、即有繼續耕種之權、年前曾經共匪搔擾之處、租額大都酌量减小、即舊有尙較「主六佃四」尤重之「三分租」、今亦減收「十八扣」乃至「十五扣」、（所謂三分租、例如收穫爲三石、地主得二石、佃户得一石、所謂十五扣或十八扣、即將二石减成一石五或一石八、是皆當地之俗呼也）、每畝地價、五年前、上等者八十元、次四十元、今則上等跌到四十元、中下亦照跌其半、雇工工資、常年者約三四十元、與他處大致相同、惟此地則供衣服鞋帽及烟錢、似較他處爲侵、其他一切精神上之待遇、均較前頭有進步、聞此皆在共匪騷擾以後、而始發生之現象、</p>
<p>年產谷米、約可自給、通常因所產麥、多運銷石牌·安慶·等地、而潛江及江西之米、遂得運入補充、年約二三十萬石、尙有茯苓·生漆·皮油·板栗·銀魚·茶葉·杮及梨等、年產可值三四十萬元、又由宿松來此、沿途白山崚峋、皆石灰岩、附近多產石灰、尤以雪山坳爲著名、</p>
<p>再北上之霍山·六安·立煌·等縣、均係將往視察之目的地、惟由此直赴霍山、途程三百八十里、中經皖山（即天柱山）分界嶺各峯巒、尙有小股共匪之赤衛隊、不時出没、若遇公務員或富商、首領即將不保、且邊僻鄉民、暗藏槍械、凡見路人、有機可乘、旋亦化身土匪、將其銀物、擄掠一空、惟見貧不放、見富不綁、則與赤匪不同、以故該路交通、早已無形斷絶、乃改路線、擬由徐家渡、渡泊湖、抵安慶、轉車經桐城等縣、而赴六安、</p>

<p>成功後邊陲可不復隔閡</p>
<p>中國航空公司、自滬平滬渝滬粤三大幹線完成後、籌闢自漢口經長沙·廣州·龍州·昆明·而達重慶之西南航線、定今日試飛、自漢口出發、茲分誌如下、</p>

<h3>鐵道業務與聯運之來年計劃（續）</h3>
<p>（乙）厲行全國鐵路貨物負責聯運一國各地之鐵路、如一人周身之血脈、必各路互相聯絡、支幹相維、遠近相應、而后能收通力合作、運輸通暢之效、倘各路各自爲政、彼此不發生銜接關係、則如人身各部血脈之彼此欠通、縱局部完整健全、而整個人體必將不支、此理至明、忽待深解、吾國鐵路聯運、在二十年前卽已舉辦、禍亂迭乘、人才缺乏、聯運事業、仍極幼稚、旅客嚇運雖歷經整理改良、雖距美滿之域、相差猶遠、至貨物聯運自民國十七年卽完全停頓、查貨物聯運與國計民生關係、較之旅客聯運、倍爲密切、倍爲重要、際茲全國經濟幾隣破產之秋、而竟放任至此、雖屬外界阻力所使然、要亦鐵路本身人事之未盡、故棪年餘以來、一面推進各路負責運輸、一面卽推進各路負責聯運、蓋以運輸而不負責、未可謂盡運輸之功能、負責而不聯運、亦不可謂盡運輸之功能、必也各路能負責聯運、然後始可謂盡運輸之功能、而收便利商民之實效、二十一年九月一日、津浦·京滬·滬杭甬·等路實行負責運輸、十月一日卽實行負責聯運、惜其他各路以種種關係、種種困難、不獲全體加入、僅各爲局部之恊定聯運、辦法旣不統一、貨運自受阻碍、爲打破此項難關計、乃召集本部業務司聯運處及貨物負責運輸委員會各同仁、彚訂鐵路負責貨物聯運暫行辦法、根據理論、參酌事實、經數月之時間、數十次之會議、始告完竣、復於二十二年九月由部召集第十六次國内聯運會議、一切聯運辦法、均經分别訂就、定於十一月一日開始實行、此後所當努力者、厥惟嚴厲執行、儘量推廣、使民國二十三年得爲吾國鐵路貨物聯運之復興時其期也、</p>
<p>（丙）實行水陸聯運　鐵路爲陸路之運輸利器、輸船爲水路之運輸利器、一國地域有陸有水、鐵路不惟當彼此聯絡、同時亦應與輪船聯絡、然後一國之交通、始稱便利、客貨之運輸始能敏捷、此水陸聯運尙矣、吾國國營水運機關、僅一招商局規模比較具備、欲求水陸聯運之早日實現、惟有亟由國有各路先與國營招商局從事聯運、因於第十六次國内聯運會議時、邀請招商局加入、彚訂水陸聯運辦法、决定由本部聯運處代表國有各路、根據所定辦法、與招商局簽訂聯運合同、再由招商局與關係各路商訂聯運辦事細則、此項合同及辦事細則現均已商訂就绪、卽可公布實行、所有沿海及長江各埠之客貨、均可與國有各路聯運矣、</p>
<p>（丁）籌辦鐵路汽車聯運　鐵路彼此間聯運矣、鐵路與輪船復聯運矣、然在今日情狀之下、猶未可　完成一國運輸機關之聯運、蓋運輸機關除鐵路輪船外、尙有航空運輸及汽車運輸兩種、航空運輸尙在萌芽時代、其與鐵路聯運可從緩論、而鐵汽聯運、則有積極進行之必要、良以晚近汽車運輸突飛猛進、大有一日千里之勢、外邦情形、姑不具論、卽就吾國言之、各省及私人之興築公路籌辦汽車者、雖在國難倉皇之中、仍有篷篷勃勃之勢、目吾國公路鮮與鐵路平行、類皆自鐵路之某站、伸入内地之某鐵、此種小鎭僻壤、多爲鐵路所不及到達、其一切交易轉徙、均惟汽車是賴、若能與鐵路聯運、使汽車路所經内地之農礦林產品得藉汽車以輸出、鐵路所達城市之製造品得藉鐵路以輸入、同時因往來便利、城鄉間旅客人數及每人旅行次數、得浙增加、則鐵路將爲汽車之吐納塲、汽車將爲鐵路之營養綫、彼此利用、相得益彰、鐵路汽車之兩受其賜、固不待言、而於便利商旅、開拓產業、發展國民經濟、溝通社會文化、所裨尤多、是以鐵路汽車聯運之籌辦、實亦爲目前急切之要圖、爰亦於第十六次國内聯運會議議决鐵路汽車聯運大綱、擬卽由各路調查有關各汽車路、根據前項在綱、商訂聯運辦法、以利運輸而便商民、（未完）</p>

<h3>由杭江路落成想到内戰</h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>我覺得「國難當頭」，實在無足悲傷，也不須哀痛。如果大家都能認明白國難的關係，和自己應盡的責任，解除國難，實非難事也許整個的民族，反能因此而振作自强。最傷心的實有無過於「内戰」了！</p>
<p>無論老大處置有無失當，我以爲在這一條破爛的船上，大家再要閙械門的玩意兒，那就祇有同歸於盡的一個結局了！我们儘可丢開了什麽國際地位，世界趨勢，以及强鄰　火打刦等等的大問題而不論，祇把小小的一條杭江鐵路來說，就可以很明顯的使大家認識内戰的可懌了！</p>
<p>杭江鐵路爲張靜江先生所發起，幾年來虧着浙江建設廳的慘淡經營，竟用最經濟的方法，把這一條共長三百六十公里的鐵路全築就了。它所供獻給浙西一帶商民的利便、眞是無可衡量的偉大，尤其可以使我們歡喜的還有兩點；第一點是杭江路的建築工程，完全由我們中國專家所計劃，絶對不曾請過一個外國人；第二點是杭江路的經網，雖然也從抵借而來，却絶對不曾借半個錢的外債。所以，我覺得就是把杭江路的運輸功能置之不論，單就牠的計劃和建築來說，已可以說是中國建設史上很光榮的一節了。但是，不幸得很，剛在它全線落成，客貨列車直接可以在江邊和玉山間來往的超始，可惡的内戰又從福建方面發動了，而又偏生就在它的附近。我們試想一想看：這樣一件良好的建設事業，不必從物質方面講，單論精神方面，如果眞因軍事而受到了破壞或停頓，那可不是等於一幅很好的圖畫，才由一個藝術家化了許多心血完成，突然給人撕碎了一樣的大殺風景嗎？</p>
<p>我愛祖國，惟望其能有復興之一日，每看到一種新的建設，心上總有說不出的歐喜，但是雖有新建設而立遭摧毁，那眞比不建設更來得痛心了。</p>
<p>朋友們，可有方法制止内戰嗎？我祈禱着你們的偉大的發明！</p>

<p>法國小說家德哥派拉從南就到北平，忽然對新聞記者大作其「女人論」，竟謂中國女人美不可言，而蘇州女子尤美。並舉證曰：「余在南京夫子廟聽中國歌曲，有一位蘇州歌女雪艷琴，伊在舞臺上的裊婷態度，我的心靈被伊迷住了幾天」云云。因此而遭北平女作家潘君英的抗議，斥德氏爲文氓，說他是輕視中國女子。</p>
<p>關於這一件公案，德氏究竟如何解答，我們且不談。不過我們在南京，確實知道夫子廟的歌女並無雪艷琴其人，只知在明星戲院唱青衣的，有個雪又琴，並不呌雪艷琴（老牌妇艷琴早已在北平嫁人了）。德氏談話原文中，說什麽舞臺上裊裊婷婷，可證其所指，决非夫子廟的那種「花茶館」女性，而是舊式戲園中的坤伶雪又琴無疑了。</p>
<p>但雪又琴又是誰呢？聽說就是容麗娟的師妹容素娟，同出於穆植田之門的。這次在京演戲，被幾個闊人很很地捧了一陣，而德哥派拉那天去光顧明星，賞鑒這位蘇州典型女性的裊婷態度時便是由這幾位闊人領了去的。</p>
<h3>戀衾</h3>
<p>— 傳翼之</p>
<p>淡黃色的朝陽，斜射到我亭子間對過牆壁的上端，知道已經是敲過七點鐘的時分了；雖然破衾中的温暖覺着很可留戀，但我不敢放開膽兒再閉上我惺忪的睡眼，爲得是關心八點鐘的早課，生怕一覺睡去，躭誤了全班小姐們的課程。</p>
<p>可是，眼睛雖然勉强增開，身子總是懶洋洋地不願「搬塲」，好像多睡片刻，即服了一單「十全大補丸」或是打過一回「補血針」似的，定會恢復昨天鎭日價工作的疲勞。</p>
<p>牆壁上端的朝陽，漸漸地移到下面的窗檽上了，髣　在告訴：這已是你的人生征程中繼續前進的時候了。它——朝陽是我認爲唯一凖確的鐘表；雖然陰雨天它也會潛藏起來使我慒慒地不能辦别早晏，我須得揩面·刷牙·着衣裳；還須跑那一里之遙的馬路——馬桶紛陳，菜販絡繹的馬路，那情勢緊張的人生戰塲中，還不肯使我這個受過創傷的一卒去「開小差」，自然，我不能不咬緊牙關把這隨從七八年的愛人——破衾抛在一邊，一骨碌地爬起，趕上那刁斗聲中的隊伍去。</p>
<p>夜裏舞倦歸來，抱着嬌妻並頭睡妻次日中午的人們，是天之驕子，是無冕之王；同時，也是人類進化途中的障礙物，在這種積極地醖釀劇變的社會中，他們是快要没落的優閑生活迷戀者之最後的一批，我曾這樣咒詛過。但，人類又像是爲享樂而生存的，多得片刻之暇，即想更多一點的舒服；我對於這暖烘烘的破被絮，猶然戀戀不捨，怎能怪他們縱情於固有的快樂呢？</p>
<p>假如我有比現實更優越，或是與他們相等的生活基礎，我必須給他們以更多的同情，這念頭會錯誤嗎？</p>
<h3>邑廟豫園開放難</h3>
<p>— 高亞魂</p>
<p>上海城隍廟的豫園，本來早就分着内園，外園，和點春堂，三處，外園是我們時常走到的九曲橋等處就是，内園和點春堂，不常開放，要到中秋端陽等勝節，才開放着，可容着閒人入内游覽，其餘的時候，則雙扉緊閉，非認識的人，和有力者，不得入内觀光的。大好園林，不能公開展覽，只供那一二私人玩賞，未免辜負。在民國十八年的時候，上海的市敎育局，曾提議過要開放豫園，以供衆人游賞，結果未見實現。日前有一位市工務局的外國工程師，偶動了游園之興，就借了幾個中國同事，到城隍廟去，游遍了内園，外園，點春堂，覺得風景幽蒨，點綴宜人，照此禁不開放，未免可惜，回去後，就向工務局建議，要求設法開放，以供市民的游覽。工務局接受了這位外國工程師的提議，就會同着敎育局，公安局，社會局，共同會議開放辦法，結果且呈報了市政府核奪，如　核准，再行去着手辦那第二步開放的手續。那裏知道市政府查閱舊案宗卷，因爲内園外園點春堂三處房屋，都是有業主執管的，而且點春堂裏邊，又設有糖業小學，和該業公會，倘若開放起來，勢必先有問題。而且豫園的房屋，都是建築已有多年，有的失於修葺，有的已在傾圮，開放之後，定要發生危險，加之道路狹窄，在那最闊的地方，也只有三尺開闊，如若做了公共游覽之區，游人一多，必要發生着擁擠。有了這幾種困難的情形，邑廟豫園的開放，也就此無形打消，成爲永秘的景物了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十一回　絮語燈前苦心訓弱息　杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>他在眼睛望着地上的時候，極力的掙扎着，扎出了一句話來，便是：二爺今天才知道嗎？積之躍是站在他當面不多遠，然而他所說出來的這一句話，竟是不能完全聽得清楚。不過他故作疑問之詞來躱開話鋒，却是看得出來的。積之這就心裏想着，他已經夠爲難的了，事到於今，差不多是流水落花春去也，今天自己便把他攔截到了天黑，又待怎麽，這便向他笑道：我自回到海甸以來，便想到府上去奉着，而且也應當去謝謝趙家老太爺。不想家兄的病，老是纒綿着不見一點轉機，裏裏外外的事，我都得照應，要想抽出一兩個鐘頭的工夫來，竟是不能夠。所以一天又遲一天，竟是把這件事情躭誤了。明後天得閒，我凖到府上來奉看。回府去，請你替我向太太問好，再見了！說畢，一面戴上了帽子，一面鞠着躬走了。桂枝站在原地方，一寸路也不曾離開，扭轉身來，只管看了積之的背影。後來還是街坊兩個小孩子，跑到身邊來問道：楊大姐，你站在這裏作什麽，丢了東西嗎？桂枝這才醒悟過來，笑道：可不是嗎？我丢了一把小鑰匙了。這兩個小孩子，倒信以爲眞，聽了這話，滿地裏去找。桂枝便攔着道：小兄弟，不用找了，這一把小鑰匙，也許我扔在家裏呢。於是走向前，摸摸兩個孩子的腦袋，也就走回家了。進得門來，釘頭就碰到了母親江氏。他看到桂枝先是悄悄的走了出去，現在又悄悄的走了回來，心中不免有些疑惑，就對了他臉上注視着。見他臉上紅紅的，心中更是不安，便道：你這幾天，身體不大好，就在家裏多多的休息一會兒罷，天氣也很凉，别出去又受了感冒。（二七九）</p>

<h3>微弱的呐喊</h3>
<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>（一）你忍心呌我先生麽？</p>
<p>親愛的妻：</p>
<p>你忍心呌我先生麽？是的，在以前，—五年以前—我們曾稱過一時的先生女士，然而現在我們是怎樣的關係？你是我的妻，我是你的夫，玉兒的爸爸媽媽—你忍心呌我做先生麽？</p>
<p>我自從前天從店裏回來，見玉兒踽踽地一個人在房中哭得眼腫聲啞，已使我十分詫異！後來我又看你的衣飾，也統統不見。起初我以謂你負氣到親戚家裏去了，可是我抱着玉兒，一家家去探詢，脚是走痠了，嘴是問啞了，從黃昏奔到半夜，始終没有瞧見你。玉兒在我的臂間，雖然因爲疲倦過甚，而睡着了，可是我抱到家裏，睡在床上，他夢囈中，會兀自呼着媽媽！唉，親愛的，經你換了我的地位，恐怕也要心碎罷！</p>
<p>親愛的，我的不能允許你假黑呢的大衣，實在是因爲今年店裏的生意，太不好了，薪水的欠着，如何能夠預支，經濟恐慌的緣故。在前年你要我做灰背旗袍時，不是我立刻答應你的麽，你是有智識的女子，我想你總不致於爲了這一些物質，就和我離婚罷！玉兒因爲五天没有見你，已在發寒熱了。親愛的，你歸來吧！</p>
<p>（二）祇要有口飯吃</p>
<p>某某先生：</p>
<p>我自從玫瑰商店歇業以後，差不多快要失業一年了。這一年中，雖然東奔西走，想謀一個糊口的職業，可是年頭是這般不景氣，各處店舖，都抱着緊縮政策，止有一批批的將夥友挑擇着歇出，絶對没有招添新夥友的。就是有幾家新創的店舖開出，他們籌備處的紙條，剛才貼出，店内的職員，却早已内定。像我這種消息不靈的人，等到得信跑去，總是失望回來了。可是我一家的衣食住各項生活，卻不能因爲我失業而停止費用。唉！這一年内開支雖竭力撙節，然而早移東補西，凄慘不堪哩！</p>
<p>現在先生是在籌備「國貨商場」，我聽得了消息，眞好像像茫茫黑夜裏，發現了一盞明燈！先生，你不是很看得起我，而又是人所共仰的慈善大家麽！靠你生活的，眞是不知若干，請你可憐我給我一些事情罷！薪俸的多少，我是不敢爭的，祇要能夠給我一口飯吃，我已是很感激了。等着你的回信，以便當面趨敎。……</p>
<p>（三）病魔决不因你是個貧人而肯放鬆</p>
<p>某某老哥：</p>
<p>我眞慚愧得很，以前惜你的欵子，還不能早日奉還，可是現在我的疾病，卻仍没有痊愈。事情當然不能幹，而醫生呢，却會不能不請；雖然王醫生對於我是特别優待，可是半元錢的車錢，和藥房裏的藥費，總不能不付。雖然我辦事的報館，可憐我的環境，仍貼還一半薪水，使我臥着拿薪。然而除了家中日常的費用，還要給付醫藥，眞是捉襟現肘，入不付出。然而不看呢，果然有關生命；看呢，卻又没有金錢。窮人生病，眞是一件最苦的慘事，但是可惡的病魔，卻不會因你是個貧人，就不和你纒繞！老哥是我最知已的朋友，請你再帮我一下物質的忙罷……</p>
<p>在這不景氣的年頭，這種凄慘的信件，是時時在社會上發現的。然後這微弱的呐喊，究竟能使聽這聲浪的人，發生怎樣感化，却是在不知可的數目裏了。然而呐喊的效力，雖不可知而呐喊的呼聲，却兀是彌漫在社會上面，這是所謂現代的景象！</p>

<h3>籃球友誼賽之江戰勝約翰</h3>
<p>之江傳遞投籃均出色</p>
<p>結果四十二比三十六</p>
<p>之江大學籃球隊來滬後、昨晚初次出戰聖約翰大學、舉行於約翰交誼室、因燈光暗淡、視綫不清、行動路受影響、之江賴妙美之短傳、與凖確之投籃、卒以四十二比三十六擊敗約翰、但中途比數、反覆無常、形勢頗見緊張、</p>
<p>之江全隊平均、攻守均佳、王迪安戚光裕之投射、每發必中、極有把握、王譜笙之接濟、使全隊呵成一氣、施衡元之守衛、地位適當、控制有方、該隊較之去冬來滬時、進步良多、戰勝約翰、良非偶然、而約翰之失敗、實因後衛空虚、聯絡生疏、投籃更無把握、結果祇以六分失敗、已覺幸甚、</p>
<p>一分之差　法官沈嗣良下令動員後、之江戚光裕首開紀錄、約翰周學賢在籃下托進、二比二後、之江鋒芒漸盛、有投必中、比數成八比四及十二比六、約翰周度暫停、振作精神、陶祖柟周學賢吳幼良三元連中、頓成十二比十二、形勢乃入緊張時期、從此比數異常接近、如有建樹、軒輊難分、之江王迪安罰陶祖冉、又以十三比十二佔先、約翰馬芳粹托中成十四比十三、約翰乃得初次導前、惟之江聯絡進取、陣容頗爲緊凑、王迪安一再妙中、再以二十一比十六居前、約翰極力反攻、周學賢三發三中、局勢忽又一變、約翰以二十二比二十二略佔上風、</p>
<p>反敗爲勝　上半時結束後、約翰以吳志毅代替馬芳粹、之江施衡元首中後、約翰吳張連中、加上六分約翰以二十八比二十三第二次領前、但往後約翰傳遞每多失效、接應無人、加以之江戒備周密、無隙可乘、於是成爲之江之天下、戚光裕目光準確、迭建奇功、霎時間建中五球之多、約翰方如青雲直上、又遭迎頭痛擊、以二十八比三十八落後、此時約翰陣容、如一盤散沙、之江則工作細膩、成敗得失、似已暗定、約翰重振軍容、再接再厲、周學賢馬芳粹等雖各有投中、但得不償失、卒以三十六比四十二敗北、之江今晚八時二十分與西青比賽、地點在西青籃球房、</p>

<h3>後衛罰出全線動搖良華籃球隊昨晚慘敗於麥令</h3>
<p>良華一路居前—結果四一比五四失敗</p>
<p>普成二九比三八敗於西青</p>
<p>今晚普成對麥令　良華滬江之戰良華要求改期</p>
<p>籃球房昨晚兩塲比賽之結果、良華普成、皆遭慘敗、普成以二十九比三十八、敗於西青、良華則以四十一比五十四敗於麥令、良華之敗、尤爲可惜、自在上半時中、穿出麥令後、卽一路居先、直至二十五比三十一時、兩後衛相繼罰出、於是全線動搖、卒至不守、然仍奮鬥至各四十一之平手後、再爲敵破、因良華表演之精彩、觀者望勝過切、賽畢竟遷怒於裁判員吳嘉棠、欲加毆打、幸得脫未傷、殊爲比賽美中之不足、普成西青之戰、普成始終屈服、未得一抬其頭、今晚良華戰滬江、普成戰麥令、惟滬江良華、良華要求改期、</p>
<h3>普成不敵西青</h3>
<p>普成先開紀錄　普成西青先於七時起作戰、西青進攻至普成籃下、球爲普成所截、遠傳而出、中鋒安谷慶直奔西青、一托而中、普成先開紀錄、然而西青經史規亞之一中、史密斯之一罰、三比二從此超出、孫彼得罰中成平手、西青之長人凌恩又中、此後西青以十分左右之差、居於前列、上半時之結果爲二十二比十六、西青佔前六分、下半時依舊在此形勢下周旋、孫彼得雖時有妙中、仍不能追上、結果以三十八比</p>
<p>二十九之比數爲西青所敗、</p>
<p>西青不如從前　西青全隊工夫、似已不如從前、中鋒凌恩、身長六尺餘除跳球外、不大靈活、監下佔便宜不少、卡爾生亦不過爾爾、除小史規亞依舊凶狠、餘者擲籃均已退化、且並不敏速、以較麥令、似不如也、普成欠敏速、不靈活是其敗因、</p>
<p>西青　犯規　得分　普成　犯規　得分</p>

<p>上半時　西青　二二分　普成　十六分</p>
<p>下半時　西青　十六分　普成　十三分</p>
<h3>良華敗於麥令</h3>
<p>敗得可惜　良華在一路佔先中、兩後衛大將相繼罰出、卒至不守、自屬十分可惜、在上半時中、良華之表演、尤多動人之處、麥令爲本届海上之勁旅、竟在屈服、良華反勝爲敗、無怪少數觀衆之因情感衝動、而有規外行動、遷怒认裁判也、但良華缺少强碾之後備軍、亦屬事實、無論任何一人出身塲、皆可動搖全軍生命也、</p>
<p>麥令聲勢　兩軍列陣進攻、唐寳堃在籃下妙傳於劉振元、一舉而中、良華遂先開紀錄、掌聲如雷、麥令毫不示弱、開登回敬一球、中將洛克連中二次、連得六分、以六比二超出、良華努力拚成各六平手、麥令又連得五分、十一比六、復成十三比八、聲勢泃泃、不可侵犯、</p>
<p>小唐顏色　在此前途悲觀之中、唐寳堃大顯顏色、滿場飛奔、不减當年丰度、連中二球、復因其妙傳、劉振元繼之而中、轉瞬、連得八分、良華遂以十六比十三超出、於是良華乃以三四分之差、躍居於前、麥令雖曾以二十四比二十三佔先一分、上半時良華仍以二十七比二十六勝麥令一分、</p>
<p>大將罰出　下半時起、良華仍居前茅、但形勢則漸見惡劣、中鋒李惠中、兩後衛張景實尹鴻祥、皆掛上三次犯規紀錄、果然於三十五比三十二時尹鴻祥開始罰出、麥令加上一分、一分鐘後、張景實又罰出矣、麥令又加一分、良華從此動搖、不堪支持、麥令連得八分、三十九比三十五居上、然良華仍繼續奮鬥、竟成各四十一、麥令急以生力運起而與之作車輪戰、從此良華崩潰、結果五十四比四十一、麥令勝、</p>
<p>戰後餘波　戰事旣罷、觀者眼看良華敗得可惜、遂遷怒於裁判員之不公、西人好爾、莫敢動手、吳嘉棠遂受其拳腿、幸得避脫、否則不堪收拾、觀者何其情感用事之深耶、</p>

<h3>西青女籃球東南敗於紅隊</h3>
<p>兩江大勝麥令</p>
<p>昨晚西青女籃球賽、東南甲之敗於紅隊、實爲始料不及、東南之失敗、一則由於無專門負責之人、一則由於新指導之不能指導、觀於該隊近來表演之每况愈下、早已料到必遭意外之敗北、兩江之勝麥令、殊爲容易、四組成績如下、</p>
<p>（一）紅隊勝東南甲　二二比十八</p>
<p>（二）兩江勝麥令　三十八比七</p>

<p>（五）籃隊勝德律風　改期</p>
<p>紅隊勝東南甲　是賽形勢、異常激烈、東南開首卽遭重重壓迫、第一節東南以四比七落後、第二節東南仍無起色、紅隊克拉克與Ｃ毛吐、各有建樹、以七比二再佔優先、上半時成十四比六、再戰聲中、東南大有起色、反攻猛烈、頗有後來居上之勢、但紅隊乘勝餘威、不稍示弱、東南因上半時所失過多、下半時得不償失、卒以十八比廿二慘敗、</p>

<p>兩江大勝麥令　是賽爲一面之形勢、兩江前鋒、十分驍勇、浩浩蕩蕩、如入無人之境、上半時麥令雖無進攻機會、但防禦尙稱嚴密、僅以一比十一落後、第三節麥令抵抗能力全失、兩江投籃如串珠、連得十九分之多、最後一節、兩江用次等角色上場、麥令極力掙扎、加上六分、結果成三十八比七、兩江大勝、</p>

<p>平分秋色　昨下午三時在棒球塲開賽、育青居順風、互有進退、戰後約十分鐘、育青進至浦東門前罰球綫外、得任意球、守門撲出、育青右翼張仲虎一蹴而中、下半時浦東順風、中堅張實、坐鎭中原連以遠球送出、中鋒李金集、一衝而進、及完局、各得一球、於是延長時間、浦東陳崇渤捷足先登、一舉而中、歡呼四起、不料於臨了之兩分鐘、育青中鋒符質彬一勿而中、浦東之歡欣、又歸於失望、乃成二比二和局、</p>
<p>各得錦標　賽畢、兩隊領隊及該會職員商議、第三次决賽日期、皆以爲時間甚促、大考在卽、且雙方均感疲乏、爲使各不失望起見、議决將錦標平分、各得一個、已有者爲育青抽得、將再製一個、以贈浦東、</p>

<p>新豐洋行報告、二十六日紐約股市、以缺乏買户、跌數角至一元餘、鋼鐵社報告鋼鐵出產量爲百分三一·六、白銀佈告之影響已成過去、交易因倫敦無市稍形呆滯、各種公債微升、全日成交一百三十萬股、「小麥」交易清淡、上落極微、氣候嚴寒無雪、故買方較穩、「棉花」耶誕節普通商業雖旺、但紗廠工作清閑、且繼續緊縮、預料本週内無大上落、明年仍當趨高、金融善後社收買黃金每周兩價格爲三四·０六元、不動、</p>

<h3>紗花多頭拉住本月紗價</h3>
<p>紗市平靜毫無精彩可言、因年暮關係、凡百商業、皆預備結賬、故現紗銷路仍滯、十二月份標紗爲最後一日、午後喊過六十九元、後以多頭公司限價七十元盡量收買、市盤得以穩定、最後一盤、仍爲一百七十元、以前交易所倉庫中之龍船採花、每日在市賤價脫售、以後之壓力、當可减少矣、</p>
<p>人標絶無精彩　人標前市開盤、以外棉仍</p>
<p>跌、形勢平澹、各月無甚上下、午後本月份多頭公司繼續收買而平定、遠跌一·四角、全日成交統計一萬六千三百包、查　出　記一千五百五十包、榮興四百五十包、大骪一千包、大爬一千五百包、同和九百包、信誠八百包、立昶四百包、買處裕大四千七百五十包、新華八百五十包、愼記三百五十包、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花多頭地位鞏固</h3>
<p>棉市　堅、因買方心意濃厚、甬帮及上海棉商皆在多頭地位、吸收額子甚巨、故　　較爲乾枯、　美棉狀况依然軟弱、惟瑞大號代崇信廠套出標花額巨、據一部份云、吃進大批廉價外棉之故、總之就實際上觀測、棉市較紗價爲高</p>
<p>鄭標穩站　鄭標前市開盤、以上日多數預測美棉有漲風、來電反跌十磅　、塲中人氣又　、各月跌五分、午後近月漲五分至一角半、全日成交統計三萬八千四百擔、查賢出大學一千五百擔、通記一千五百擔、源大一千擔、瑞大八千四百擔、愼記一千一百擔、益昶一千一百擔、源興昌一千擔、買進恒益五千三百擔、愼昌三千三百擔、明德二千一百擔、仁豐三千二百擔、新華一千四百擔、源興昌一千一百擔、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉近期又進一角關</h3>
<p>英印埃棉市均休　無市</p>
<p>昨日美棉市况、景滯無特色、缺乏買户、南方賣出、及華爾街　軟而跌、結果現貨跌十磅音、期貨跌五磅音至十二磅音、刋物浦棉及埃及棉孟買棉市場均休業、原電錄左、（二十六日電）</p>

<h3>津棉紗市氣平疲</h3>
<p>津訊本市棉紗交易、仍不甚多、市清尙平、窩洛沽帮買三十二支彩球紗二百三十二元、實坻帮買十六支三喜紗一百七十五元五（統稅在内）</p>
<h3>糧食期粉麥一致低落</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份一致呈傾落無已之態、以洋麥報價、　芝加哥微好四分、坎拿大無市、但市塲空氣、自被日商在大連以最廉價格、抛售洋粉、似乎大部分人心、將受剌激、兼之年内結束之故、業外多頭、非了不可、故自本月份至四月份、遂均打破一角關口、較前日又跌二三分、此種情形、實出諸意料之外、旋因市面太巨、空頭獲利暢補、市面遂回高一二分、迨至下午開盤、本月份因已近最後交易、開價卽跌、後復稍好、終則依然下落、最低至二元零八分半、遠期各月份、初尙平穩、後亦稍軟、結果本月份較前日跌一分七厘半、一月份好五厘二、四月份爲二厘半、五月份好五厘、</p>
<p>麥市上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均呈傾跌之象、以洋麥報價、出入甚少、人心方面、自少活動、惟現洋麥之售價、　被加稅所限制、不過定價合劃、實際加稅之後、反少關係、此後已定各將　　進口、粉廠之需要、當然以洋麥爲主體、更以粉市之逐步不振、各月份市面、　不能再擴、結果一月份較前日跌七分、二三月份跌七分、四月份跌六分、現麥因　家未動、又無做開云、</p>
<h3>客秈市價續跌</h3>
<p>—泉州續有辦裝—</p>
<p>昨客秈市况、承數日來之疲風、繼續不振、本客胃口仍呆、行情續小三五分、惟行情一再下跌後、貨主已不願再爲賤價出售、本街與泉州帮本有辦意、隨趁機收買、泉州帮共辦去各水一千二百包、計湖南機紅米七百五十包、售六元九角至六元八角八分、又糙紅米二百五十包、價五元七角、無　機秈二百包、價六元六角二分、本街辦去蕪湖機元米三百七十三包、價七元七角至七元五角半、湖南機油二百餘包、價七元０五分、價比前市爲小、但今後去胃再旺、卽可轉站、</p>
<h3>晚稻市况續見挺秀</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三十餘號、其中晚稻占十餘號、而包胃去路如天津烟台等帮續辦千包、故市仍起色、行情步高五分、各帮厚粳及杜洋尖本街胃納尙可、惟市况尙難挺秀、價無榮辱、陰變元酒户及零胃雖多動辦、然以吃盤未鬆、市形猶屬定局、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船四十號左右、市上各貨去化仍滯、白粳羊杜埠客等價均見定局、陰變元價小數分、早薄稻略帶緊勢、</p>
<h3>黃荳客銷無進展</h3>
<p>昨日黃荳市况、使然　軟、惟下身貨已跌到三元、暫可立定、上中貨　削二三分、　市交易七八車、由廠家及本街兩帮購去、刻下來源雖少、但應積有　　十車、沙黃荳銷胃亦淡、市氣平疲、杜豆　少無市、</p>
<h3>糖市新漳刁青已開出</h3>
<p>十二元六角</p>
<p>昨糖市、趨勢仍疲、公會到　二　粗砂白　通貨劃十九元五角半、比前日又小五分、轉口貨呌六元七角半、原價未成交、八九號荷赤普通莊劃十五元七角、太古糖Ｂ嘜車去五分、劃二十元一角半、ＣＷ嘜二十元、糖記一號綿白仍十八元五角半、地蝅四號照退、潤青無上落、昨開一百數十包、價爲十三元三四角至十二元七八角、建帮號家日前所到首批新漳刁青一百數十包、昨已如數開出、價爲十二元六角、</p>
<h3>閘北貨興化雜牌正二轉跌</h3>
<p>興化桂圓、今庚以上檔貨缺、如各牌正二曾售一百二十餘元、挺立多時、但邇來終以價昂、銷路轉呆、於是各行售價相繼降落、昨市各雜牌正二較高者售一百十四五元、其次照减、頗覺遷就、比前降去十餘元云、</p>
<h3>絲茶黃土絲銷用漸廣</h3>
<p>川鄂等省所產之黃土絲、停價較廉、國内各絲織廠銷用漸廣、本月中浙屬杭紹湖嘉以及蘇屬等處、共計裝去黃土絲一百三十七包、用以織造黃色綢縐云、</p>
<p>生意經（五十二）</p>
<h3>日用品商場的概述（一）</h3>
<p>（溪南）</p>
<p>上海誰都知道是通商大埠，百業薈萃，大而至於幾千萬萬進出口貿易，小而至於日用所需，公司行號，林林總總，不曉得有多多少少，到如今恐也難得一個數字统計。商調姑且不唱，單就我們日用所需的商店，憑一已經歷所得，寫出來以供閱者參考，亦可謂「愚者一得」的了。</p>
<p>先就糧食一糧來說，米店無論是那條路上都看得見的。米號也有兼做「切麵」生意，亦有帶做「馬料」，並有帶賣麵粉。本來米店向米行進貨，用的是「海斛」，而伊出賣的時候是用磅秤，以二百磅凈米作一石計算，外加袋皮四磅。但是買進的米，如其是高米，每石有二百十五六磅，少則亦有二百七八磅，這是米店當官的好處。如今米行改用市斛，米店亦改用市稱，但是如蚞你要問他們仍用舊的稱量，也可照辦，不過價錢加高罷了。</p>
<p>米行有南北二市，南市在豆市街，自從外馬路新碼頭成立之後，米行爲便於斛卸便利起見，都在該處設立出張所，因此豆市街只成爲米業的結帳所在。北市在閘北光復路河下，大概在新閘橋北岸一帶。他們都是由販米的船户，經過經售商之手，以達於米行，由米行再售於米店，而由米店再售於消費者，此尙是大概言之，已覺得居間繁多，手續重重，若從生產者——農民——之手，以及於消費者，居間轉搬者更不止此了。</p>
<p>豆麥芝蔴油餅菉豆生仁，統稱爲雜糧，這一帮行號大都是米行兼做，以豆市街居多。但雜糧業中客帮亦屬不少，這又在愛多亞路民國路附近一帶。交易的所在，上午在豆市街采菽堂，下午在民國路雜糧油餅同業公會，期貨嵵肯雜糧交易所（在愛多亞路外灘之西）。至於本地油廠買賣，則在油廠業公會。麵粉廠爲便於駁卸粉麥起見，大都設在滬西閘北，靠近蘇州河，他們的現貨買賣則有麵粉同業公會，期貨則有麵粉交易所。</p>
<p>吃食方面，上海是形形色色，無奇不有，可是就尋常的說，吃便飯往往到飯店弄堂，如今是改爲大陸商場，飯店弄堂，已成爲歷史上的名辭了。飯店弄堂之小菜，以炒圈子（猪腸）及炒捲菜（魚肚實）等得名，結帳則用小洋，比較略爲便宜，故爲一般經濟朋友所歡迎。在大陸商場未建築前，九江路自直隸路口以東，止於山東路口，這一帶幾乎握了飯館業的權威，其中尙有當時所謂酒館業公所中三家之一太和園，喜慶生意，與法大馬路之鴻運樓，南北並時，一至　間，這一段馬路上，常覺得車馬暄閙，行路不便。</p>
<p>經濟飯這名詞，居然也風行了。可是在五六年前，雖有兩塊鹹肉，一盌豆腐湯，三盞白飯之便宜飯，但究非一般所能堪。其時廣東酒樓除了北四川路外，其餘有則亦多以宵夜小吃爲宗，十年之前，費了兩角大洋，就可吃一客宵夜，白飯可以隨量吃，毫不限制，小菜則可就其範園内，冬菇鴉，爆蛋，香臘腸等任憑客便，點食兩樣。後來廣東酒館一天一天的發達，而有今日局面，宵夜所費，亦數倍於昔了。</p>
<p>廣東酒館之發達，疑與「革命」有相當關係。自從以廣東爲革命策源地，一般革命分子，紛紛南征。及國民革命軍北上，吃慣南國風味的健兒，遂與廣東小菜發生了密切關係，因此粤菜風行於滬上，江浙人見了可怕之「龍虎門」竟亦大動其食指了。</p>
<p>就作者記憶所得，經濟飯菜，始於三馬路的美農川菜館，其時爲每客五角，後來漸漸推行到别家菜館。近幾年來，菜飯四喜肉，居然又盛絶一時，東新橋一帶，爲飯菜的發祥地，固不必說，此外的地方，亦與經濟飯後先嫓美了。（待續）</p>

<h3>「崇洋」與「迷舊」</h3>
<p>— 林徽音</p>
<p>不滿於現狀想是人情之常，而社會之得以日益進化也可說大半由於那現狀的不滿而加以改善。可是，中國人却往往並不如此，就是對於現狀雖有所不滿，却並不設法把它改善，只想找一個什麽寄托，以忘却或鄙視那現實。</p>
<p>要鄙視自己，便儘量崇拜歐美，西洋人的隨便的一句話，或者隨便的一個行爲，都被看做神奇的，是值得被仿效的，而有時甚至崇拜　但願自己就是那外國人。只是那顯然不是可能的事情，於是，不得已而求其次，便有意地或無意地把自己看做或簡直呌做東方的某外國人，或者某外國人第二，在電影界，在文藝界，在政界，在無論那一界，中國都有了那樣的人才；在外國，一國中只有幾個的，而中國却幾乎有了各國所有的全體。</p>
<p>可是那只是說崇拜，只是說仿效，而且仿效得幾乎自己就是那被仿效者，却並不就是說懂得。要說懂得，却就很難。卽以一件日常的最瑣碎的事情說，現在門上裝彈簧鎖的是很多了，可是口袋襄隨帶了鑰匙的却似乎很少，而總是回家時還得不嫌麻煩地呌着門。只知道洋人的就是好的，却往往不知道好在什麽地方。</p>
<p>還有一種不滿現狀的人使他自己退縮到舊時去。那退縮會是十年，二十年，一百年，或者一千年。他看那時是多麽好，爲人旣超脫，生活又安閑，可踏雪尋梅，可邀月飲酒。他實在逼得無法再歷止的時候，就引一行他那心靈所寄托的古人的詩，或節幾句文，以稍屬他的心中的積鬰。</p>
<p>現狀是可被忘却的，而洋的崇拜與舊的迷戀就是忘却現狀的兩個最簡捷的方法。這兩個方法的被應用從這正在伴着我們前進的耶穌誕辰與新年兩個節期的被一般地稱做「聖誕」與「陽歷」新年就可看到是很普遍的。誕辰被稱做聖誕的，中國原來也有一個，可是現在要是只說聖誕而不名的語，那就决不會輪到那中國的，而一定指的是耶穌的誕辰，不管你信不信他的敎義；而說着過陽曆新年的，他不用說還在等着，過新年丨丨那是正宗的新年，所以倒也不一定要用那「陰曆」的冠辭。</p>
<h3>談「潛書」</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>「學徒悅入，文自怨生」，此予十年前初讀唐甄潛書跋記之語也。何謂「文自怨生」？先哲有言，作易者其有憂患乎！文王囚於羨里，乃演周易，易自怨生也。詩云，君子作歌，維以告哀。小雅頗多怨悱之篇，詩自怨生也。屈原之作離騷，馬遷之作史記，亦皆自怨而生。讀史記自叙，可知古之所謂聖貢，埀文章以自見者，莫非發憤有託之作，此予「文自怨生」之說所由來也。</p>
<p>其在唐甄，一爲縣令而不能行其志。罷官以後，僦居吳市，僅三數椽，蕭然四壁。炊烟嘗絶，日采廢圖中枸杞葉爲飯，衣敗絮，陶陶然，振筆著書不綴。初名衡書，志在權衡天下，後以連蹇不遇，更名潛書。其大命篇痛論貧富不均苦樂不平之現象，至謂天下之亂皆從此起，非自己餓過肚皮，而亦不願人之同餓肚皮者，不能有此深七著明之言也。其仰尊，室語等篇，痛陳專制之罪，非深有惡乎當日之獨夫民賊，而徹悟一切聖帝賢王原亦不過爾爾者，亦不能有此深中肯綮之言也。其室語篇略謂自秦以來，凡爲帝王者皆賊也。今也有負數匹布擔數斗粟而行於塗者，或殺之而有其布粟，是賊乎？非賊乎？殺一人而取其匹布斗粟猶謂之賊，殺天下之人而盡有其布粟之富，乃反不謂之賊乎？三代以後，有天下之善者莫如漢，然高帝屠城陽屠頴陽，光武屠城三百。遇里而墟其里，過市而竄其市，入城而屠其城，此何爲者？百姓死於兵，與因兵而死者十五六，暴骨未收，哭聲未絶，於是乃服袞冕，乘法駕，坐前殿，受朝賀，高宮室，廣苑圃，以貴其妻妾，以肥其子孫，彼誠何心而忍享之？若上帝使我治殺人之獄，我則有以處之矣。蓋唐甄生當明季，目擊政權代謝之變，屠戮亂離之慘，嘗一仕異簇新朝，而沈於下位，不能上達，無以自見其才志，故怨悱之意一發於文章，而不自覺其心濆涌，筆手擾也。何况彼時愛新覺羅氏初入中國，務爲慘刻之政以威中國人，而中國人屈於暴力之下，一時莫可如何，於是士之巧黠乾惟日歌頌現狀，以取容於胡羶之朝，獵富貴以自適：其耿介自守者，惟有逃避現狀，相率遁跡於山顚水涯之間。唐甄生於其時，旣不能歌頌現狀，自儕於無恥之曲上，又不能逃避現狀，自命爲勝國之遺民，其始也有志改造現狀，擬著衡書，其終也發憤攻擊現狀，而潛書成焉，予謂其文自怨生者此也。</p>
<p>何謂「學從悅入」？唐氏之忍飢耐寒陶陶然從事著述，前旣言之矣。潛書悅入篇云，「古人敎亦多術矣，不聞以悅敎人，而予由此入者何？予蜀人也，生質如其山川，湍急不能容，而恒多憂恚，細察病根，皆不悅害之，悅爲我門，非衆之門。」彼又以爲不悅則常懷煩懣，多見不平，多見非理，所以一切怨天尤人，不相親愛，皆由此生。悅則反是。由是言之，唐氏之所謂悅，實爲不悅之悅，蓋出於處境之無可如何，傷心者之言也，彼豈眞能怡然自悅者哉！如其怡然自悅，而無怨焉者，則固不必發憤著書，潛書可以不陳矣。</p>
<h3>橋上</h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>潭子灣的橋上，在左邊的石欄杆底下，有一個賣花生的。</p>
<p>除了雨天或者落雪的時候，不得不帶着傘子，手挽着一個竹籃，跑東跑西的呌賣以外，他都是坐在那條石欄杆底下，地上舖了舊報紙，把花生分成一堆堆的，守候着主顧。</p>
<p>他很蠢，不會兜生意，成天呆坐在那裏，也不跟着人家呌幾聲，簡直像尊不開口的菩薩。</p>
<p>「三個銅子賣十顆！」</p>
<p>看到有人在面前走過，他也動一動嘴唇，可是說的話只有他自己聽見。他賣的花生並不算貴，可是在這兒，連吃花生也像成了過於浪費的閒食。因爲生意清，坐着無聊，他不斷的把花生分堆，有的六顆，有的八顆，也有的十顆；有幾天他從家襄帶出來幾百顆花生，分來分去的分到晚上，竟没有少去一顆。</p>
<p>附近全是窮得連飯也吃不起的江北人，他們螞蟻似的　集在小河上的小船裏，成天運糞運煤運草紙，抽不出一點空閑。靠鐵路，是他們住的鴿子棚，茅草屋頂，黃泥墻，飄飄搖搖的，經不起一陣風吹。火車飛過的時候，那些茅屋頂上就積上了一層灰塵。這些茅屋的管家婦，全丢了家庭上工廠去；她們的兒女却全在街頭巷尾掘煤渣，抬廢紙，檢破瓶破管，雖則還是穿紅褲子的小子，在工作上却已不能小覻了。</p>
<p>這兒的齷齪尤其驚人，橋上街上公路上全是成天疾馳着公共汽車，野鷄汽車，揚起了濔天的塵霧。小河蒸發着臭氣，遠遠地，在那片荒蕪了的曠場上，你還可以看到無數露天的毛厠，無數朝天的，在那裏大便的屁股。</p>
<p>「三個銅子賣十顆！」</p>
<p>有時他比較大聲的喊，想多掙幾個銅子，却是徒然的，他也曾减價，三個銅子賣十二顆，或者二十四顆只要五個銅子，但走過去的人只是望望，搖搖頭，彷彿這幾個錢也是他們負不了的重擔。他們全是貧苦而且怨忙的，如果有誰袋裏時常放幾個銅子，而且有暇站到橋上來剥花生殻，支花生衣，吃花生肉，那才是希罕。</p>
<p>賣花生的一天坐着，像尊不開口的菩薩，有時却也悶得慌的找人家談天：</p>
<p>「我眞不懂爲什麽没有生意！」</p>
<p>「不吃花生倒很自然，没有人剃頭才是奇怪哪！」</p>
<p>回話的是個頭上盤着一根小辫子，耳朶上還掛着一隻鋼耳環的小子。他一早就帶了一個安着面盆的木架子，帶了從他父親手裏遺留下來的剃刀，耳刷子，到橋上來剃頭，生意自然也是非常冷清的。</p>
<p>「剃頭嗎？哼，這些江北人也不見得需要這個！他們一年剃幾次是有一定的，不到留得像長毛一樣，决不會想到刨一次芋頭，而且做你們這種生意的太多！」</p>
<p>的確剃頭的很多，到處都可以看到安着面盆的木架子旁邊，坐着跟這小子一樣油膩，一樣襤褸，一樣滿身都是頭髮的人。</p>
<p>「那末你的花生更没有人吃了。」</p>
<p>「好像……却也不見得……」</p>
<p>聽到他們的談話，坐在不遠的一條皮凳上面，一個成天籠着袖子的補鞋匠，突然的插進來說：</p>
<p>「到我這兒來補鞋的人也很少呢。」</p>
<p>「那是當然的——」賣花生的很憂鬰地說，「這兒的江北人能夠穿鞋子的根本不多！」</p>
<p>「可是……」</p>
<p>補鞋匠還想再說，但他看到他們的憂鬰的臉，也只得沈默了。其實他也明白的，在這個貧民窟裏，不但吃花生，就是剃頭補鞋子，也似乎是不必要的，可以節省的浪費。</p>
<h3>書話（續）</h3>
<p>— 俊之</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>在「嫩窩筆記」中，所記愛書狂者之事，還有一則，其文曰：「少室山房筆叢：張文潛柯山集一百卷，余於臨安僻巷見鈔本，印記奇古，裝飾都雅。余驚喜，時不持一錢。顧奚囊有綠羅二匹，并解所衣烏絲直掇，青蜀錦半臂，罄歸之。其人苦書不售，得值慨然，因約明旦。余返寓通夕汪寐，黎明不巾櫛訪之，則夜來鄰火延燒。此書倏燒燼矣。夫見一異書而至於解衣，且至通夕不寐，可謂篤嗜之至矣。不意火神惡作劇，竟乘夜收拾而去，何其巧也？」</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>黃山谷說，「士大夫三日不讀書，自覺語言無未，對鏡亦面目可憎。米元章說，「一日不讀書，便覺思澀。」愛書狂者之與書，眞有如空氣，不可片　離。而讀書，在愛書狂者看家，不僅可以增加文學修養，也是一幅極其美麗的畫圖，極優美的生活，如陳眉公的「增减浣溪沙」所云：</p>
<p>梓樹花香月半明，棹歌歸去蟪虫鳴，曲曲柳灣茅屋矮，掛魚　。笑指吾廬何處是？一池荷　葉小橋横。燈火紙窗修竹裏，讀書聲（見「岩棲幽事」）。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（七二）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>她把他緊抱在懷裏又哭起來了：隨後她把自己的臉孔緊貼着哲安的臉孔繼續說道：「好的，但是筆爾呢？我們怎能和他在一起呢！」</p>
<p>哲安低聲說：</p>
<p>「我們總可以想出一個辦法來。你是再不能和他在一塊生活的。」</p>
<p>一想到大的一個兒子，她便痛苦得痙攣起來。</p>
<p>「不能，我再不能和他一塊生活了，不能！不能！」</p>
<p>她於是投在哲安的懷裏，她的精神方面遇着了危難似的，呌說道：</p>
<p>「你把我從他的身邊救出來罷，我的小寳寳，救救我罷，想個辦法，我不知道……找找看！救救我罷！」</p>
<p>「好的，媽媽，我會想法子的。」</p>
<p>「立刻……非立刻不行…你不要離開我！我害怕他…我怕得這樣厲害！」</p>
<p>「好的，我會找出辦法來的。我應許你。」</p>
<p>「啊！可是快，快！你眞不知道我看見他時，我是怎樣的一種感覺。」</p>
<p>隨後她在他耳朶裏輕輕地說：</p>
<p>「把我留在這裏，留在你家裏。」</p>
<p>他猶疑着，以他那種確切的思盧細想了一下，他便懂得了把他母親留在他那裏的危險。</p>
<p>可是他得和她許久許久地解說着，爭辯着，以一些明確的論證來戰勝她的狂亂和恐怖。</p>
<p>「祇要你把我留着今晚一晚，」她說，「祇要你把我留住今夜一夜。明天你可對羅蘭說我因爲病了所以没回。」</p>
<p>「這是不可能的，因爲筆爾已經回去了。來，勇敢點罷。明天我便要把一切事情調理好。明早九點鐘，我便會回到家裏。來，戴上帽子，我送你回去。」</p>
<p>「你要我怎樣我便怎樣，」她帶着一種小孩子似的，恐懼和感激的信從態度說。</p>
<p>她試着起來；可是她所受的打擊太厲害了；她還不能把自己竪在自己的腿上。</p>
<p>於是他給她喝了一點糖水，呼及了一點Ａlcali用醋給她揩了一揩太陽。她像分娩後的產婦一樣，聽憑他服事。</p>
<p>他終於能夠走路了，她挽着他的臂膀。當他們經過市政廳的時候，時鐘正敲三點。</p>
<p>在他們的住宅面前，他抱吻她，對她說道：「再見，媽媽，請勇敢一點。」</p>
<p>她偷偷地爬上那寂無人聲的樓梯，走進她的臥房，連忙脫下衣服，懷着以前那種和人幽會後的感動，溜進正在鼾呼着的羅蘭身旁。</p>
<p>在那屋子裏，祇有筆爾一人没有睡着，他聽到她回來。</p>

<p>杭江全路通車特刋（魯滌平題）</p>
<h3>發刋辭</h3>
<p>— 曾養甫</p>
<p>總理實業計劃，以條築鐵路爲一切建設之主幹。五六年來，國事搶攘，朝野上下，對此建設主幹之鐵道，未能積極修築，全國志士，引以爲憾。今者長僅三百五十餓公里之杭江鐵路告成，乃爲中外人士所屬目：舆論界且於其舉行通車典禮之期，特出專刋以張之。此固非特别矜寵此短程輕軌之鐵路；殆以千里之行，起於跬步，龐然大輅，始自椎輪，望之深即所以責之厚歟！同人之愚，深知今日所成就，無以仰副先覺及社會人士之期望；而三四年來竭知盡忠之經過情形，與夫建築此路重要意義之所在，固亦不敢自文其陋，而不公諸社會也</p>
<p>鐵道爲交通之命脉；政治之推行，經濟之調節，富源之開發，文化之改進，鐵道實負重大之使命。居今日而言建築鐵道，又須審察地方之財力，切合經濟之原則，適應社會之需要，勉符時賢所揭槳窮幹快幹之精神。杭江鐵路之建築經費，非出諸借貨，卽集自民衆；出諸借貨，則成本必求其最低；集自民衆，則負擔必求其至輕；故建築材料，盡採輕磅，一切設備，又極簡陋，此非故落人後，實以中國建設，非窮幹末由進行也。築路目的，在便利交通，而鐵路本身，又須求其利益優厚。杭江鐵路自江邊至蘭谿一段，以創始之多艱，亦僅費時兩載；金華至玉山一段，則以一歲之時間，趕築完成。此非草率將事，實以鐵道之建築，非快幹無以應社會之需要也。雖然，杭江鐵路意義之重要，尙不止此。</p>
<p>中國今日之建設，經緯萬端，斷非政府財力所以勝任；而社會對於國營事業，又狃於往日之失敗，無堅確之信仰，雖感資金之過剩，而不敢放胆投諸建設事業；中國建設之不能積極進行，此乃其重大原因。然杭江鐵路之建築經費，出諸社會这投資，幾及二分之一；風聲所樹，觀聽一新；今後社會人士，亦能發揚此互助合作之精神，使一切建設，同時並舉，躋中國於富强，其意義之重大，爲何如耶！</p>
<p>抑又有進者；吾國以幅員之廣袤，高山大川之縱横梗阻，各方旣自爲風氣，遂不能早達於沆瀣一氣精誠團結之域。杭江鐵路之完成，雖足以解决浙江一省交通之困難；而其北端僅始於杭州之對岸，其南端又僅達江西之玉山，均未能與他鐵道接軌；局於一隅，收效未宏！縱觀全國之鐵道建築情形，則粤漢一線，雖已積極修築，而武漢鐵橋，觀成尙無時日，天塹長江，望而興嘆；京滬杭一線，雖以首都輪渡直通北部，而錢江潮汐，天限東西，欲求目窮千里，尙待更上層樓！今幸玉萍鐵道之興修，開工有期，錢江大橋之建築，亦早經籌備；倘能發揚扶助杭江鐵路之精神，朝野協力，各方合作，則他日由玉萍一線，以啣接粤漢，由錢江一橋，以溝通京滬杭而達津浦隴海；北極邊陲，南窮百粤·飊輸四達·胡越一家；隔閡旣除·感情自治，則此區區三百五十餘公里之輕軌鐵路，實與中華民國有莫大之關係，卽對總理全部實業計劃之完成，亦自有相當之助力。今日社會人士之過事矜寵，蓋有重大之意義在其中矣！養甫無似，得追隨諸賢達後，躬與其役，勉底於成，有餘榮焉；因抒其一時之感云。</p>
<h3>杭江鐵路金華江大橋</h3>
<h3>路史</h3>
<p>— 杜鎭遠</p>
<p>沿革</p>
<p>萌芽　浙省經營鐵路勤議，肇始於民國十六年。其時國軍北伐，肅清江浙，張靜江先生受命來主浙政，鑒於兩浙交通，爲山川形勢所限，爰命建設廳派員勘測浙贛浙皖兩路線，計劃建築狹軌輕便鐵路。　以張公去浙，案遂擱置。至十七年冬，張公方長建設委員會，兼秉浙政；卽於是年十二月，電調鎭遠來浙，仍循前測浙贛路線，重行踏勘，起自杭州閘口，遵錢塘江左岸，經富陽，桐廬，建德，蘭谿，龍游，衢縣，迄於江山，再</p>
<p>延至江西之玉山，以通信江。全路約長三百十七公里，經兩閱月而勘畢。於十八年二月八日，提經浙江省政府委員會第二０三次會議，議决，依照都定標準制，建築鐵道，定名浙江省杭江鐵路。</p>
<p>籌備　十八年二月念五日，浙江省政府委員會第二０七次會議，通過杭江鐵路籌備處組織大綱，任命鎭遠爲本路籌備處主任。三月一日，籌備處成立，先後組成四個測量隊，分段擔任全線初複測工作。五月念九日，省政府委員會决議，杭江鐵路籌備處限於五月底結束，應卽改組工程局，着手計劃本路工程事宜，并任命鎭遠爲浙江省杭江鐵路工程局局長兼總工程司。六月一日，工程局成立，七月念九日，各測量隊初複測，次第報竣，一律回局製圖。是時省政府因本路建築經費，尙未籌有的欵，擬發行浙江省建設公債一千萬元，並指定該項公債六百二十六萬元爲杭江鐵路建築費用；雖經呈奉中央核准照辦，究以債額旣鉅，驟難募足，致陷停頓狀態。</p>
<p>改道　同年十二月十日，轉奉省政府令，飭以杭江鐵路工程避原有人員，辦理蕭常公路工程，並將已經指撥建築鐵路之一部分經費，移充建築蕭常公路之用。——情勢至此，杭江鐵路工程局名義雖未撤消，實施建築，殆屬無望。詎不久復因建設廳提案，以蕭常公路里程較長，所經各地，人烟稠密，物產豐饒，客運而外，尤應兼顧貨運，任重致遠，殊非公路汽車所克負荷，擬循此線，仍按標準軌間，改用輕軌，改築蕭常輕便鐵路，庶於節省財力之中，兼寓徐圖發展之意。當經省政府委員會議通過，着即動工修築。惟查此線與前定杭江路線，係趨同一方向而行，差别僅在杭江係循江左，蕭常係循江右，現旣改循江右以進，蕭諸義金間，地勢平坦，工程便易；爲貫澈最初計劃接通贛東起見，乃就原定蕭常路線北段，延至杭州對岸西與江邊爲起點，經蕭山，諸暨義烏，金華，越金華江，改經湯溪以達龍游；自龍游而西，因衢常常玉間均有商辦汽車路，抑且常玉之間，山嶺重疊，工程較難；爲節省工費及避免競爭計，决仍採用前測江左線之一段，從衢縣迄江山，展延而玉山。是爲本路幹線，計長三百三十六公里；又由金華築一支路，以通蘭谿，是爲金蘭支線，長約二十四公里。經茲改變以後，蓋已不復以蕭常兩邑爲全路起訖。於是仍稱杭江鐵路，以符名實。</p>
<p>工程</p>
<p>江蘭一段　本路路線旣定，乃於十九年三月九日舉行開工典禮。先將西興江邊至蘭谿間路線，劃爲兩個總段，六個分段，同時動工建築。至十二月十四日，江邊諸暨間，開始釘道。旋因本省財政困難，建築經費不繼，奉令將各項工程分期漸進，因而進行又復稍慢。迨二十年五月以後，省政府與杭州四銀行訂定借欵合同，始容放手做去；乃於六月一日首先通車至尖山，七月一日通車至諸暨。十月一日，再向諸暨以上開始訂道，卽就工程所届，逐站通車，至念一年三月六日，通車至蘭谿。江蘭段工程於是告竣，遂入瑩業時期，本段路線計長一百九十五公里，自開工迄於完成，適爲二年。</p>
<p>金玉一段　金華玉山間工程，因得部會贊助，撥借中英庚欵，備購國外材料，復由省政府商得杭州四銀行同意，繼續借欵，以充完成全路建築之用；乃於念一年九月一日，開始複測金玉段路線，并組橋標探騐隊，前往探騐沿線橋址；約兩個月許，先後藏事。爲便利督率進行計，將該段劃爲兩個總段，八個分段，同時招標承築路基土石方工程，並於十一二月間，次第開工。至該段大橋，比江蘭段較多，目因金華江橋，地位筕衝要，工程最鉅，特爲提前招標，於十二月二十日首先開工；其餘大小橋樑，亦經分别設計，招商承包建築，或由局雇工自辦。此段路線計長一百六十五公里，祇因建築經費，係一次籌足，故工程進行，進展甚速，迨七八月間，即開始分段釘道，至十月初已達江山，遂於十月十日通車龍游，十一月一日通車衢縣，十一月二十八日釘道至玉山，全線完成。計自開工至現在，爲時僅及一年。</p>
<h3>資本</h3>
<p>本路全線係分二期修築。省廳所籌經費，撥作本路建築資本者，來源亦自不同。茲將江蘭段及金玉段之資本支出，分述於后：</p>
<p>（一）江蘭段　本段路線計長一百九十五公里，建築費支出實數計銀六百九十三萬九千五百一十六元四角三分·又攤還銀行團借欵本息計銀三十一萬六千二百四十四元二角五分，兩項共計資本收入總額應爲七百二十五萬五千七百六十元六角八分。其中由省政府以建設公債票等作抵押品，向杭州中國·浙江興業·浙江地方·中國農工等四銀行·兩次借欵撥付者，共銀三百六十萬元，由省廳自行籌給者，共銀三百五十三萬四千九百八十三元八角七分，尙有十二萬餘元，係由銀行團在續借建築金玉段經費内扣除。</p>
<p>（一）金玉段　本段路線計長一百六十五公里，建築經費概算約需銀六百一十一萬餘元。約可分爲兩類：一爲外洋材料費，一爲國内建築費，前者係撥借中英庚欵二十萬鎊，截至念二年六月底止，已購外洋材料僅用十四萬鎊，約合國幣二百二十萬元，尙餘六萬鎊擬留作將來擴充設備之用，故未列入本期建築費内；後者因經費來源有限，亦分兩部估算，凡爲維持通車必不可缺之工程及設備，屬於第一部，需銀三百五十六萬餘元；有關增加行車安全及維持初期營業，一經通車即須興築之工程，屬於第二部，需銀三十四萬餘元，除此三十四萬餘元之費用，擬於通車以後，在營業收入項下分月撥支，藉省初期建築資本外，其第一部國内建築費三百五十六萬餘元，則由省政府再與前次借欵之杭州四銀行續商墊欵二百五十萬元，不敷之數，并將出讓杭州電廠所得餘欵如數撥充。至此段資本支出確數，須俟建築賬結束以後，方能决算。</p>

<h3>工程報告</h3>
<p>— 杜鎭遠</p>
<p>計劃</p>
<p>本路經營之目的，旣在貫通兩浙，而其線路所經，原爲總理手訂東南鐵路系統幹線之一段：將來延長展修，一端可通東方大港，一端伸及南昌，以聯南海鐵路，再展至萍鄉，與粤漢鐵路銜接。便可直達廣州；地位重要，已可概見。一切工程計劃，自應悉依部定標準制辦理，以期久遠；惟是本路建築資本，係由浙省政府自行籌措，限於財力，未能驟作大規模之進行；而熟察浙東經濟狀况，目前亦尙無鉅量運輸，是以審時度勢，因地制宜，幾費研究，始决採用輕軌寛距之計劃，以節初期築资本。惟一切設計，均經預留改善地步，以便將來營業發達時，得隨時更換重軌，行駛重量機車。茲將本路工程計劃，分項記述如下：</p>
<p>（一）鋼軌及配件　本路鋼軌，係採用每碼重三十三磅者，其長度及斷面暨道釘尺寸，均按美國土木工程師學會之規定辦理；惟魚尾板及螺栓孔，則係另行設計，以增軌道荷重。魚尾板長度爲五百零八公厘（二十吋），較原規定增長九十八公厘（三又八分之七吋），螺孔中心距，每孔各增二十五公厘（一吋），計爲一百二十七公厘（五吋），以期適用於懸點接結法。</p>
<p>（二）軌距　仍採用標準軌距，以期便於更換重軌，目前所費有限，而將來改善時所得甚大。</p>
<p>（三）軌條啣接法　本路路基新成，道碴未能充分舖設，軌條啣接處，難免時有沉陷現象，故採用相對連接法（SquaroJoint)，以免軌道成爲極複式之波浪形，而策行車安穩。</p>
<p>（四）軌枕　枕木係用一百五十公厘（六吋）見方二千四百四十公厘（八呎）長之松木，每整軌（九千一百四十四公厘卽三十呎長）鋪十四根。當初原擬儘量利用國產，嗣以當地產量不豐，未能充分供給，不得已改用洋松，以應急需。</p>
<p>（五）道碴　本路道碴，每公里計需八百二十五公方，在枕木以下之厚度爲二百公厘（八吋），其採料辦法，或就沿線開山採碴，或在附近溪河挑取砂碴，或選沿線溪河有多量卵石者，敷設臨時支線，伸至岸邊運取，均屬就地取材，以資節省，而免糜費。</p>
<p>（六）路基　本路沿線土質尙佳，故塡</p>
<p>土之旁坡（ＳideSlope）概規定爲二比三之坡度，其塡方之寛度，則視塡土之高低爲轉移。挖方之寛度一律爲四公尺，兩旁另留排水溝，以資宣洩：塡挖土之高深在六公尺以上者，在旁坡中間加做一公尺寛之馬道，以防旁坡塌落，西維線路之安全。至於挖方之旁坡斜度，則隨地質之不同而各異規定，土質爲一比一，軟石爲二比一，硬石爲四比一。又在路基兩旁坡脚下，均留有二公尺至四公尺不等之馬道，以期將來路基展寛時，仍有適當之馬道，而不致反復塡挖。</p>
<p>（七）橋梁　本路橋梁，分永久性，半永久性，及臨時建築三種，因地制宜，相其緩急，而爲經濟之設施。永久性質者，鋼梁橋居多，混凝土拱橋次之，均按部定標準載車設計。間有上部鋼梁暫按古柏氏三十五號荷重設計者，將來可隨時添加蓋板，以增載重，半永久性者，橋座橋墩，用混凝土建築，亦按永久性之載重設計而上部建築則按古柏氏二十號之荷重設計，或利用滬杭甬鐵路舊鋼梁，或於墩座間暫加木椿墩，上架木梁，以便將來易於改造，臨時建築，均係木質便橋，橋座橋墩均按古柏氏三十五號荷重設計，而上部建築，則按古柏氏二十號荷重設計，將來亦可隨時加添</p>
<p>木梁，增加載重。</p>
<p>（八）線路　線路最大曲度半徑，普通規定爲三百公尺；惟在特殊情形之下，爲避免鉅大工程起見，得用較小半徑，但不得小於二百五十公尺，最大坡度，連同曲線上之坡度折減力在内，規定爲百分之一。其餘曲線之超高度及堅曲線之設計，以及直線之最短限度，均按照部定國有鐵路之標準制辦理。</p>
<p>（九）車站設備　各站設備，以簡樸適用爲原則，以期減少初期建築經費。最初通車時，或用枕木架屋，或租賃民房，或建最經濟之臨時房屋，以作站房，或暫借廟宇，作爲臨時售票之所。惟對於給水，及機車客車之車房，以及爲謀旅客便利而設之月台雨棚等，則致全力而爲適當之建築。</p>
<p>（十）機車及車輛　機車之選擇，以適宜於本路軌道之最大牽引力爲主；貨車則採用十五噸容量之車，客車則注這三等車之設備，務求其舒適完美；並擬於全路通車後，增加三等臥車，以應長途旅客需求。</p>
<p>（十一）信號　本路通車伊始，車次不多，並因建築經費關係，行車暫以電話電報通知，用簡單式之旗號，爲列車出入站之號誌。現在營業漸見發達，故於二十二年度，先在江蘭段各站，添設遠近方臂形號誌，及開車臂形號誌，以策安</p>

<h3>縉麗路馬頭山開山工作</h3>
<h3>設施</h3>
<p>計劃旣定，實施工程，除鋼軌枕木機車以及客貨車底盤等，必須向國外購買者，概由本路直接向外洋訂購，以免包商從中牟利外，其餘大部份工程，均採包工制，以資簡捷。並爲辦理及監督</p>
<h3>杭江鐵路大陳鳥瞰</h3>
<p>指導便利起見，江蘭段工程時期，將全段衋爲第一二兩總段，每總段各設三個分段，每分段管轄線路約三十餘公里；總分段長各駐於該管段内，以便就近督促。該段完工以後，卽將第一二兩總段併爲第一總段，並取消分段制，下設四個工區，專司養路事宜。金玉段工程時期劃爲第二三兩總段，每總段下設四個分段，每分段管轄里程約二十餘公里。茲將本路工程設施概况，分類記述如下</p>
<p>（一）路基築造　路基土石方工程之發包，係按土石性質及高低分類，以章價爲準俟竣工後再行計方給價。江蘭段首次招標者爲江邊至尖山及尖山至諸暨二分段；第二次招標者，爲諸暨至蘇溪，</p>
<p>蘇溪至義烏，義烏至金華，及金華至蘭谿四分段。由新民公司承包江邊至尖山一段，約共土石方二十二萬公方，大同公司承包尖山至諸暨一段，約共土石方五十一萬公方；諸暨以上，改用詢價辦法，同時發交大興金記趙春記協和雲陞等十餘家承做。金玉段計長一百六十四公里，約有土石方三百二十萬公方，劃爲金華至前里，前里至湖鎭，湖鎭至龍游，龍游至東蹟，東蹟至二十里街，二十里街至江山，江山至新塘邊，新塘邊至玉山八個分段，同時招標承築，當卽簽訂合同，於二十一年冬先後開工，至本年秋陸繼完竣，工程之進行，較之江蘭段順利多多。</p>
<p>（二）橋梁及水管　江蘭段各橋招標承築，最後仍用詢價法，交由包商裕慶昌升中南東興庚午等公司分别承做，十九年五月開工，陸續興築，二十年冬先後全部告竣，大小橋梁共一百座，内計鐵橋六座，除尖山江橋下部用木椿墩係臨時性質外，餘均混凝土橋座，共長一七七公尺，總價九萬餘元，又大小混凝土拱橋十八座，共長一一八公尺，總價十六萬餘元，又大小木橋七十六座，共長一二一七公尺，總價五十一萬餘元。金玉段橋梁水管工程，因招標較易，除水管係由裡工安設外，其餘皆係開標選擇包商，計有大橋十二座，共長一千六百餘公尺，小橋四十一座，共長三百七十八公尺，約共需一百三十萬元。</p>
<p>（三）軌道　本路因經費關係，全線軌道材料·分三批購辦·第一批八十公里·備舖江邊至諸暨之用，第二批一百四十四公里，供諸暨至蘭谿間之用，第三批一百八十公里。係爲鋪設金華至玉山間之用舖軌工程，因此亦分三期進行。初期於十九年十二月中，自西興江邊開始舖釘，係裡工自做，至次年六月方釘到諸暨。同年十月第二批材料運到，諸暨以上路基橋工，亦已大致告竣，遂向諸暨以上繼續釘道，二十一年三月卽釘至蘭谿。第三期　舖釘金玉段，改用包工制，自本年五月下旬開始進行，至十一月二十八日舖釘至玉山終點，本路全線至此完成。本路路基新成，尙未堅實，卽行舖軌通車，致石碴朝舖夕沉，時感不足；復以車輛較少，除供客貨運輸外，連碴車僅有兩列。江蘭段至本年六月底，已舖之石碴，尙不及原定之二分之一，嗣以金玉段開始舖軌，運碴車改爲運料之用，舖碴工作，遂告停止。金玉段之石碴，現方就路基鬆軟處開始舖墊，尙未遍及，所幸路基土質尙佳，列車減低速率，行駛尙屬安全。至於舖碴之費用，江蘭段每公里約合九百二十元，金玉段正在進行，尙難統計。</p>
<p>（四）車站設備　本路全線車站，幹支線共三十四處；此外更於江邊站迤西六公里許，設靜江站，又在靜江站對岸設閘口站，以利貨運，江邊對岸三郎廟設營業站，以便旅客。各站距離最長二十七公里半，最短五公里，其等次則係斟酌各地人口物產及交通情形而定。江邊爲本路起點，業務較繁；金華位於全線之中，金蘭段支線之始，復有金武永縉公路，可資聯絡；玉山係本路終點又爲浙贛物產轉輸薈集之區；故其車站均列一等。臨浦，諸暨，蘭谿，龍游，衢縣，江山，賀村等處，或係縣城，或屬重鎭，或爲出產豐富之地，故皆劃爲二等站。其餘則視當地情形，分别列爲三四等站。各站一切建設，則因經費關係，對於無碍行車安全及旅客便利者，莫不暫從簡陋，多按就地取材而設計，或竟租賃民房廟宇爲辦公處所，祇求適用，不事增華。</p>
<p>（五）電報電話　本工程及擬數　電話用十二號硬鋼線三對，電報用不　　　鐵線一條，因隊於　費，須外　　行，故一到未能依　　　　　　　　　　杭州線局至江邊　　　工　，初係　補村料，請由　省　　電話局代掛十二號鋼線兩對，於十九年三月一日開工，四月底掛竣。因水線關係，經由關家堰過江至張家村，均係借用電話局電桿及水底電纜，計長三十七公里；張家村至江邊，則係自行立桿掛設，計長六公里；綜計此段全長四十三公里。嗣以水線日久受濕，傳音欠佳，電話局與本路均感不便，乃合購十對蕊水線一條，各用其半，計長七百公尺，已於二十二年春更換藏事。惟此段電報線，至今尙付缺如。江邊至蘭谿間電話線，係於十九年六月由本路自行掛設十二號硬銅線兩對，二十年一月掛抵蘭谿。六月車通尖山後，因電信緊要，復添掛電報線一條，二十一年二月完竣，其時通車將届蘭谿，復另設車務話線（十二號硬銅線）一條，故江蘭段内連同引入線共長一百九十八公里。江邊諸暨義烏金華等處，各設交換室一所，共話機六十五架，報機八具，工料費總額二一０·一六四元，（連同杭州總局至江邊及延長線在内共長二四一公里）平均每公里工料費八七二元。金華至玉山間，因求工程進行之順利，端賴電話以通消息，故興工後不待電料準備充裕，卽於本年二月間卽沿路線立桿，掛設八號鑛鋅鐵線一條四月下旬抵湖沿，因材料不敷，暫行結束，工作僅七十餘日，完成正線一五六公里，引入線八公里。總長一百六十四公里，工料費計共二九，０一四元。嗣借中英庚欵訂購之材料到齊，繼續在該段内掛設電話線三對，已於最近完工，並將先掛之鐵線，移作電報線之用。至全部工料費之决算，現正在從事編製中。</p>
<p>（六）機車及車輛　機車及車輛底盤，國内尙乏出品，必須向國外訂購。其鉚釘及車身裝配等工程，凡屬可以自辦者，均自行設計，並由本路西興機廠擔任工作，惟其數量，亦因經費有限，未能充分購置，僅以足供目前需用爲限。現已行駛有日者，計有機車九輛，客車（頭二三等齊備）三十輛，貨車（内分棚車敞車平車）八十輛。機車之速度，每小時可行五十公里最大牽引力三百公噸；二三等客車坐位可容五十二人，貨車載重均爲十五公噸。其借用中英庚欵訂購之機車車輛，已運到貨車底盤五十輛，陸續製成棚車敞車平車等加入連輸。此外機車六輛，客車底架二十四輛，尙未運到。以上合計共有機車十五輛，客車五十四輛，貨車一百三十輛。　來當業發達，如不敷用，再行添置，以應需要</p>
<h3>總結</h3>
<p>本路工程浩大其計劃及設施情形，當不止上述之簡略；祇以限於篇幅，僅舉犖犖大者作概要这報告；至其詳衋之記載，已由本路另編工程紀略一册，於本日在金華舉行通車典禮時，分贈各界來賓，並寄致國内各地重要建設機關及學術團體，請求指敎，共策改良。茲再就本路建設費用扼要言明，以爲總結：</p>
<p>本路全線總長約三百六十公里，建築費總額，因金玉段工程甫經完竣，全部决算，尙需時日；惟江蘭段决算爲七百二十餘萬元，金玉段預算爲六百餘萬元，兩共約一千三百餘萬元，平均每公里價額，連同總務費在内，約需三萬六千餘元，尙不及其他各路之半數。雖因財政關係，暫用輕軌，但已足以應付現時之運輸，並適合我國經濟初步發展之需要。故自本路創辦以後，如江西之玉萍路，福建之龍漳路，山西之同蒲路，四川之成渝路，皆擬倣照辦理，以期輕而易暮，藉使社會明瞭築路並非困難，向日視爲畏途之心理，得以轉變，此則本路所引爲榮幸者也。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>業務，自宜從簡；故參照鐵道部客貨專運輸通則，并斟酌本路情形，擬訂浙江省杭江鐵路客貨運輸暫行規則。客運方面僅先辦旅客及行李運輸，貨運方面祇限於現付。迨二十一年三月江蘭段完成通車，遂於七月一日起，添辦包裏牲畜車橋貨幣等項運輸，八月一日起，開始辦理到付貨物，同月三十日承運郵件，十月一日開始與京滬滬杭甬路辦理旅客聨運。至二十二年四月，江蘭全段通車已滿一年，營業應有設備，如車站站台貨棧等，均經次第建築，各項業務，自應逐漸增辦，乃經呈准，於七月一日起，完全適用部定中華民國鐵路客車運輸通則，貨車運輸通則，貨車負責運輸通則，及提貨單章程。前訂本路客貨運輸暫行規則，卽於同時廢止；又參酌本路特殊情形，擬訂客車運輸附則九條，貨車運輸附則十一條，一併呈准公布施行。又自七月一日起，與京滬滬杭甬路開始辦理負責貨物聯運。</p>
<p>茲將二十年六月一日通車尖山時起，至二十二年六月三十日止，按照會計年度，列爲二十年度（連二十年六月份收入併計在内）及二十一年度營業進欵，除雜項進欵不計外，其客貨運收入概數如下：</p>

<h3>組織</h3>
<p>本路工程局原設工務總務兩處，局長兼總工程局司，副局長兼總務處長，並設秘書及股長段長。　因緊縮，裁去兩處，改爲總務工務連輸會計四課，並裁撤秘書。總務課分文書，材料，地畝，庶務，人事五股，材料股管轄材料廠所，工務課分設計，橋樑，考工三股，並指揮工務第一二三總段，運輸課分車務，機務，警務三股，車機警各分區段，均　於各主管股，機務股於管轄分段以外，兼管機廠及車輛檢修所與機務材料所，會計課分綜核，檢查，出納三股。</p>
<h3>杭江鐵路與公路（體誠）</h3>
<p>杭江鐵路原定路綫，自杭州以上，本沿富春江西岸桐廬建德各縣，以達蘭谿；因工程艱鉅，費用浩大，乃有變更路綫之議。十八年冬，杭江鐵路進行停頓，省府前張主席，調杭江鐵路同人，代築蕭山經金華蘭谿至常山之公路；而因沿綫地勢平坦，遂由建設廳秉承省政府，决定改就此路綫興工建築輕便鐵路。蕭常公路早經劃定爲本省腹部幹綫，今旣改築鐵路，公路路綫遂不得不隨而變更。現在本省公路網新計畫第四幹綫之杭廣綫，丨丨即七省公路第三幹綫滬桂綫之一段，丨丨所以就杭富路展築至蘭谿者，即以此故。此一段路綫交換歷史，實爲杭江鐵路與公路發生關係之嚆矢。今杭江鐵路旣全綫正式通車，杭廣公路工程，亦分段漸次告竣；於此觀成之日，回憶十八年决定變更路綫，使杭江鐵路得以迅速完成，公路雖少感困難，於進行仍無甚大障礙者，是可見輕重緩急之間，府廳當日蓋權衡至當，而鐵路公路能藉此交換路綫以表現互助精神，亦大可紀念也。</p>
<p>杭江鐵路變更路綫而後，因錢江一水之隔，西興遂爲全路之起點。江面遼闊，何能淤淺，客貨之運渡，俱感不便；公路方面，浙東興浙西，亦因錢江不能聯絡，故錢江大橋之需要，在鐵路及公路，實含有共同姓，而均急不容緩。今幸建設廳秉承省政府一本歷來開發浙東之宏願，經將錢江大橋之設計，委託專家悉心研究，且規定鐵路與公路同在一橋上通行，其運輸之收入，又均爲橋梁建築費之擔保，故鐵路公路之合作，又賴錢江大橋而更爲接近；他日浙東經濟社會之繁榮，隨杭江鐵路與公路事業以俱進，可預卜焉。</p>
<p>錢江義渡，自杭江鐵路通車以後，每日渡江人數，日益增加，月達四十萬人以上，而因渡船設備，均可簡陋，西與碼頭尙未建築，行旅賞慮不便，雖錢江大橋，業經設計，而緩不濟急，義渡仍即有改善必要。現在計畫，除將原有碼頭渡船，加以整理之外，擬即著手函興碼頭之建築，其經費亦經規定，由杭江鐵路局公路局及地方人士，共同負擔，興工之日當不在遠；此則在錢江大橋未經建築以前，本省爲便利兩岸交通應有之設施，而鐵路公路當局，尤盼望其早日成功也。</p>
<p>公路之性質，本所以補助鐵路交通之不足；本省旣有此杭江鐵路，又急圖浙東之開發，所有公路計畫，尤當依據此原則，在可能範圍以内，儘量謀所以輔助杭江鐵路而共同發展。今杭江鐵路各大站有與公路綫銜接者，試列舉之於下：</p>
<p>（一）蕭山站，山成之公路，如蕭紹，紹曹嵊，嵊新各段，均賴此站以與杭江鐵路啣接，爲紹屬各地利用杭江鐵路之樞紐；（二）諸暨站，此站與紹諸路銜接，以加便紹屬各地之交通；（三）義烏站，此站與義東路銜接，更由東陽經長樂以接嵊縣轉入台屬，遂使台屬各地，享有鐵路交通之便利；且寗屬各縣，亦可由奉新路以達新昌，再經嵊新嵊長各路而趨於杭江鐵路；</p>
<p>（四）全華站，此站與金永永縉縉麗各路銜接，以達處屬各縣，處屬各路如麗雲龍麗青温等均在建築中，將來完成之後，温處兩屬均經由金屬而與杭江鐵路相貫通；</p>
<p>（五）蘭溪站，由此站可與建德惇安遂安各縣聯絡，以達邊境；</p>
<p>（六）龍游站，自此站經龍游之溪口，以達遂昌及松陽，轉接處屬各路；</p>
<p>（七）衢縣站，</p>
<p>（八）江山站，自此兩站，可賴衢常常玉衢江江廣江浦各路之聯絡，以直達贛境之玉山廣豐及閩境之浦城建甌等處，而四通八達之衢屬交通，對於杭江鐵路，乃大有環而拱之之勢。以上各路，或已成，或未成，或正在建築中，或正在計畫中，要皆公路同人仰體府廳開發浙東輔助杭江鐵路意旨，以籌劃而措施之者。至於衢蘭衢江兩段路綫雖有與杭江鐵路平行之處，然衢州爲軍事重鎭，腐有加築交通副線之必要。且在杭江鐵路金玉段建築期間，此兩段公路業已完成，一切材料之輸送，員工之調動，至爲便利，金玉段之能提早完成，衢蘭衢江公路，蓋亦不無微勢；卽在杭江鐵路全綫通車以後，亦可賴短程營業，以資維持，而收相得益彰之效，固無競爭之可言也。</p>
<p>杭江鐵路與公路旣同樣負有開發浙東之使命，他日浙東各地生產日衆，運輸日煩，當在意料之中。今雖杭江鐵路業已通車，本省公路網新計畫亦瞬將告竣，而營運方法，猶有待於改善。今後甚望杭江鐵路與公路今日商訂一妥善之聯運辦法，則開發浙東之盛舉，其收效必愈宏大；此又鐵路公路同人所應通力合作之犖犖大者。</p>
<p>茲值杭江鐵路舉行通車典禮，杭江鐵路局將有特刋之編行，乃徴文及予；予維省有鐵路，舍廣東與東三省而外，今惟浙江有之。歷任主席廳長之豐功偉績，兩浙人士類能言之，無待予言。又准國人自造鐵路，自平綏路而後，亦惟今之杭江鐵路。杜　勤局長終始其事，與在事諸公之勞勛，兩浙人士又類能言之，亦無待予言。予所欲言者，蓋别有在；予承乏本省公路局，变旣有年，公路又本有補助鐵路交通之性質，而當此府廳積極開發浙東之會，杭江鐵路與公路且同負此項使命，則雙方過去之關係，未來之合作，以及現在聯絡之狀况，眞予所應言也。質之兩浙人士暨杭江鐵路局同人，以爲何如？</p>

<h3>枕江鐵路運輸設施及管理方針</h3>
<p>— 金士寛</p>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>浙江省之建設杭江鐵路，其使命在便利人民之交通，與開發内地之經濟。及建築完成，貫穿浙省，聯絡贛閩，其經濟使命固極顯著，而在政治及軍事上，更占重要之地位。吾輩經營此路，在求營業與運輸之發達，務使沿缐人民得到最大之方使與利益，並使鐵路本身，不特收支適合，且有盈餘可以還本。服務杭江路同人，均能認清此點，期不負建設此路之使命。</p>
<p>杭江路金華至玉山一段，雖方屆完成，而杭州江邊至蘭谿一段，則通車營業，已逾兩載。江蘭段兩年來之運輸設施及管理方針，亦頗多與吾國各路不同之點；全線通車後，仍當本此方針，改着進行，尚望各路專家有以敎之：</p>
<p>（二）關於運輸設施</p>
<p>（一）注重三等客車　各路客運等級，多分三等或四等，客運收入，則三四兩等幾佔全部百分之九十。故杭江路認清此點，以全副精神，整理三等客車，空氣光線，及清潔設備，均在他路之上，此爲一般所肥認者。</p>
<p>（二）冬季開駛小工車　京滬杭路均關駛四等車，便利平民，杭江鐵路雖無此項設備，然於冬季特開工人專車，因沿線人民，多出外工作，冬季回鄉，其性質與各路之四等無異。</p>
<p>（三）三等中式飯車　客車膳食設備，各路多用西式菜饌，不特暢銷外貨，且定價昂貴，又不合國人習慣，旅客多感不便。杭江路不售西菜，並將中式飯菜，分成三等，以便各級旅客，此外取銷三等車之呌賣雜食，以整秩序。</p>
<p>（四）添設二三等臥車　各路臥車設備，僅限於頭二等，杭江路現正添置二三等臥車，以便夜車旅客。</p>
<p>乙，貨運</p>
<p>由鐵路營業之本身言，發達貨運，較客運尤爲重要。因客運之設備費用，較貨運爲大，故貨運之發展，尤應注意。杭江路之發展貨運設施，亦可分成左列數點：</p>
<p>（一）實行負責運輸　杭江路於開始貨運之時，卽辦理負責運輸，初爲有限制之規定；自二十二年七月起，貨物完全由路負責，如有損失，照章賠償。然實行以來，絶少賠償之事發生，可見負責運輸，並非難辦，祇須員工之管理手續完備可耳。且負責運輸，並不加價，蓋認爲路局應負之責任也。</p>
<p>（二）擴展貨運範圍，其辦法分下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）鐵路路線所經地點，並非全屬名都巨鎭，故須設法吸收較遠之貨物。杭江江路於蕭山，臨浦，義烏，金華，蘭谿各站，均建築接運碼頭或岔道，直達水埠，實行水陸接運。</p>
<p>（二）在杭州之三廊　及閘口兩處，分設車站，承運貨物，並經辦渡江手續。</p>
<p>（三）計劃於都市中心地點，設立營業辦事處，接收貨物，代各運往車站，此皆便利商人，擴展貨運範圍之辦法。</p>
<p>（三）貨運辦法商業化　我國鐵路，以多屬官辦，且有獨占性質，因之營業方法，不免沾染官場習氣。杭江路對於營業，純從商業原理着手，一方面糾正員司對待商人之方法，一方面灌輸鐵路運輸知識於客商。其實施辦法，一爲將鐵路運輸簡章，印成廣告，到處露佈，且遠及沿線各鄉鎭，以免轉運公司上下其手。二爲予商人以發裘意見之機會，在沿線重要城市，召集運輸會議，由路局與商人共同討論溝通彼此意見。三爲訓練員工，注重商業習慣，以和平誠摰之態度對待運商。</p>
<p>丙、聯運</p>
<p>杭江鐵路與京滬杭路旅客聯運辦法，自二十一年月起，卽已實行，至負責貨物聯運辦法，於二十二年七月實行；中途旣可免報運手續，又可省轉運公司佣金，商貨負擔減輕，貨物銷售增旺，鐵路營業亦因而增加。全線通車以後又擬加入全國聯運，貨運必更見起色，如沿線出產紙類，可以直接運銷北方。至與杭江路銜接各公路之聯運，如蕭紹，金永武，義東，江浦各路，均接分别進行商訂辦法。惟水陸聯運，以水道船舶，尙無正式之組織，一時不能實現。</p>
<p>丁、營業狀况</p>
<p>杭江路民國二十一年度之營業收入，計爲一百二十六萬餘元，其間上半年度，爲六十萬元，下半年度爲六十六萬元，平均每月增加一萬元。二十二年度開始，卽二十二年七月至十月，每月平均十二萬元，較二十一年下半年增加百分之二十，將來金玉段通車，自可再有增加。至乘客人數，二十一年度爲九十七萬人，平均每月八萬人，本年一月份增駛工人車，乘客超過十萬人。貨運噸數，除工程及公務貨物不計外，二十一年度爲六萬八千噸，計去年下半年爲二萬五千噸，今年上半年爲四萬三千噸，噸數之增加頗多，可見商人之利用鐵路運輸者，日見其多。</p>
<p>戊、發展地方經濟</p>
<p>發展交通之目的，不特求其本身合於經濟原理，尤負有發展所經地方農工商業之使命，使彼此互相扶植。各國鐵路，均有研究考察並振興沿線實業之組織，南滿中東兩路，亦利用此法，而營業發達。杭江鐵路現雖尙無餘力，直接扶助沿線農工商業之發展，惟各地經濟情形，已從事調查，覺有數點，可以報告：</p>
<p>（一）杭江路沿線人口，頗形稠密，所產物品，不能自給，人民每赴杭嘉湖一帶工作，冬季回鄉度歲，故有移動性質。</p>
<p>（二）沿線之經濟情形，尙屬農村社會之組織，出產多爲農產與牲畜；運出貨物，米穀而外，多猪牛之類副產品，運入貨物，在杭州一路，爲自嘉湖蘇常收集之天然肥料，以及洋貨棉紗布疋火油糖肥料之類，在寗紹一路，則爲食鹽棉紗布疋，多係以原料交易製造品，價值不能相抵，農村經濟因之衰落，故扶助發展沿線之農工商業，爲急不容緩之舉。</p>
<p>（三）杭江路上江一帶之内地商業路線，計有兩線，一爲福建，一爲江西，其經濟組織，與金衢一帶相彷彿，亦有扶助發展之必要。</p>
<p>（三）關於管理方針</p>
<p>鐵路管理之要點，在效能與經濟。本此兩目的進行，杭江路管理方針，可分左列數點述之：</p>
<p>（一）採用有效能之組織　杭江鐵路局之組織，簡單而有效，局長之下，僅設總務，工務，運輸，會計四課，並將通車後，與運輸有關之車務機務警務三部分，合組運輸一課。責任旣專，指揮便利，合作容易。各課之下設股，範圍小，用人亦少。</p>
<p>（二）厲行預算制度　求鐵路管理之經濟，必須以預算爲用欵支配之標準。杭江路自開辦後，卽厲行預算制度，凡資本支出，營業支出，均於事先詳細規定實行。用欵旣有固定支配標準，則支出與收入方可適合，債務方能清償，信用方能維持。</p>
<p>（三）減低營業百分率　營業百分率是支出與收入之比率。杭江路念一年度營業收入，爲一百二十六萬元，營業支出爲八十八萬元，收支之比例，不及百分之六十五，尙須設法再求減低。中國各路收支比例，北甯路無百分之五十，京滬路爲百分之六十五，滬杭甬路爲百分之七十，而日人經營之南滿鐵路，則爲百分之三十。此在管理之是否得法，是否經濟。今杭江路全線完成，收入必更增加，而支出必不至隨之同比例俱增，是可斷言也。</p>
<p>（四）訓練員工　求鐵路管理效能之增高，須先求組織之健全，尤須求人才之補充。杭江通車後，所需各項人員，先期招考程度相當學員，設立車務機務警務三訓練班，授以實際敎課，並施行嚴格運事訓練。現已有二百二十人，訓練完畢，分派服務。金玉段完成，車機警三部分，未曾委任新人，亦本路之一創舉也。</p>
<p>（五）提高警察效能　鐵路設警，原爲維持秩序，保護客貨，而補充地方警力之不足。杭江路警除前述兩項職務外，兼可收驗客票，旣可省去許多車站職員，並且提高其地位。此外又飭路警看管貨物，以代看貨夫役。警察又須服從站長之指揮，以一事權。故各路警察，不聽站長指揮，及與車務人員發生衝突之弊，均未得見於杭江也。</p>
<h3>杭江鐵路軌行汽車</h3>
<p>（四）　江之經驗</p>
<p>浙江省辦鐵路，並非杭江一綫開其端。前清光緒末年，卽有浙江鐵路公司之發起，陸續完成閘口至拱宸橋，杭州至楓涇，曹娥江至甯波各段路綫，浙省遠在廿五年前，已有如此成績。後因清廷主張鐵路國有，而浙路本身，又以成本過鉅，經營不善，無法維持，遂於民國三年，由政府接辦，而所投資本，則並未收回。今杭江鐵路，得長官之指導，負責人員之努力，能在時間短促經濟困難之環境下，得相當之成績，對於中國鐵路前途，已有絶大影響。現在商辦之蕪乍路，玉萍路，漳龍路，同蒲路，成渝路，皆擬倣照杭江路辦法，分頭積極進行，改變鐵路國有之風氣，轉移社會築路困難之心理，杭江鐵路不無相當貢獻。於此可見在財政困難之中國，惟有中央規定原則，凡全國幹綫及國防邊疆綫，應由中央政府從速建築，其各省路綫，得由中央給予經濟與技術上之扶助，由各省分别辦理。中喘與各省通力合作，始可打開中國之鐵路建設，逐漸完成中山先生十萬英里鐵道之計劃，此則士宣服務於杭江鐵路所得之感想也。</p>
<h3>杭江鐵路沿線電話事業之將來</h3>
<p>— 趙曾珏</p>
<p>鐵路公路電信三者，在交通工具中，居同等之地位，負同樣之使命，相輔相成，各有特殊之效用。浙省於公路電信，已有相當之曆史，規模可云粗具。今全國唯一之省有鐵道杭江鐵路、又定期舉行全線通車典禮。謹將關於浙江省長涂電話，在杭江鐵路沿線分佈之狀况，與業務之將來，作簡略之貢獻：</p>
<p>浙江省電信網，分全省爲杭長，杭甬，甬温，杭衢，衢温，杭處，杭楓等七大幹線。杭長線，由杭州經餘杭，武康。吳興。而達長興，接蘇境以通南京。杭甬線，沿杭甬路，通甯波：甬温線，由甯波，經甯海，臨海，黃岩，樂清，而達永嘉，將來可與福建相接：杭衢線，沿錢江，經常山與江西相接：衢温線，由衢縣，經龍游，遂昌，松陽，麗水，青田，而至永嘉：杭處線，由杭州，沿杭江路，經金華，武義，永康，縉雲，而達麗水：杭楓線，由杭州，沿杭滬路接蘇境通上海。是以杭江鐵路全線所經，計佔全省長途電話幹缐有二；自杭州經蕭山諸暨義烏以達金華，爲杭處幹線之首段；自蘭谿經龍游衢縣江山以達玉山，爲杭衢幹線之尾段；金華蘭谿間，則有金蘭分線爲之聯絡。此外如義烏浦江間，義烏東陽間，金華武義間，金華永康間，龍游遂昌間，江山常山間，蘭谿湯溪間，則均有分線之敷設。故凡杭江鐵路軌跡所達之處，不惟均有長途電話可資利用，且更能與全省已通長途電話之七十一縣之任何一縣，及京滬兩地聯絡通話。旅浙者旣因杭江鐵路之成，得以朝發錢塘，暮宿仙霞；更能藉全浙電信網之密佈，雖處身千里，仍得與家人父子互傾積愫，以慰覊旅之情焉。（　　　）</p>
<p>除上述長途電信網而外，在杭江鐵路沿線，如金華蘭谿衢縣江山等處，均有城鎭電話之設施。金蘭兩處電話用户，均在一二百家左右，悉爲省欵所經營。衢縣江山之城鎭電話，原係各該縣籌備，惟因杭江路構通後，有不得不力謀擴充，以應所需；但以原有機件效率欠佳，維持不易，亦將劃歸浙省電話局接管，藉資改善，而便整頓。至龍游之城鎭電話，原非急要，最近亦受杭江路之影響，以各商業一日千里，突飛猛進，對於該處之城鎭電話，頗有不容或緩之感，浙省電話局亦在進行籌設中。</p>
<p>浙江省長途電話，在杭江路沿線之業務，原以蘭谿爲最發達；全年營業額，在一萬數千元以上；金華次之，達七千餘元；衢縣又次之，約五六千元；其餘各局，則均在四五千元至二千元之間。惟近自杭江鐵路全線通車以來，蘭局業務，日就衰微，而金華營業，則蒸蒸日上，大有取而代之之勢。最近自杭江路金玉段完成後，龍游衢縣江山間之話務，與金華有同時並進之勢；昔日長途電話之最稱發達如蘭谿者，將移其重心於金華，而龍游衢縣江山等，素以爲無足輕重者，將與杭江路業務相輔而並進矣。蓋交通事業，與經濟發展，相關綦切，一地之經濟狀况，每因交通情形之更遷，而生消長盛衰之變化也。</p>
<p>總之，交通工具莫不相輔而行，卽地方之經濟，亦莫不隨交通事業而發展。有志建設者，其鑒諸！</p>

<h3>圓的哲學</h3>
<p>— 曲辰</p>
<p>在一切形當中，方是太多稜角；三角又會使人想到不調和的戀愛；長是舒緩；而短双侷促；厚則重　；薄嫌輕佻；只有圓最渾成，效用最廣，而也最受人歡迎。</p>
<p>舉例來說：車輪是圓的，所以能輾轉千里。户樞是圓的，所以能隨意　　。飯碗是圓的，正好對準嘴巴。馬桶是圓的，恰恰套住屁股。倘將這幾樣東西，統統易了方的，那麽，車輪不動，門户不開，飲食時嘴將大酸，而大便時也要感到如坐針氈了。其受窘眞不堪言狀。</p>
<p>故一切適用的東西，均以「圓爲貴」。</p>
<p>不獨是器用，即藝術上也是如此。過去的詩人吟「六寸圓膚光緻緻。」現代的詩人吟詠「豐滿的乳房呀！」等等。凡是一切曲線美的崇拜者，換句話說都是「圓」的崇拜者。而擁護最力的則有古希臘的數學家阿几米得司，他到被羅馬人殺死時，還嚷着「不要弄壞了我的圓」呢。</p>
<p>至於做人，則不可不講。因爲尖近於刻薄，方亦太多稜角，時有用不通的地方，總不及圓的渾然噩然，得天之道，運用起來，可以八方無碍。</p>
<p>譬如你在十月天氣，偶爾外出，忽路遇一癆病鬼式的朋友，身衣重裘，嘴裏還在嚷冷，這時他倘向你「寒暄」起來，你切不可告以自己的經騐，說天氣並没有如他所說的那般冷，因爲在他的感覺中，天確是有那般冷。倘你一說出與他相反的經騐來，他會疑心你是有意和他搞蛋的。最好也是這樣說：「啊，天氣眞冷啊！」在你自然肚裏明白，但在你的朋友却因此滿足了，將引你爲「同志」。</p>
<p>又如有近視的朋友，硬指空中飛過的麻雀爲蒼鷹，你也不可與他爭辯，這一是什麽。因爲在他的視線覺中，或許的確是一隻蒼鷹也未可知，爭辯的結果，勝利不見得一定屬你，而感情的破裂，倒是穩有的。</p>
<p>這裏我想起一個典型的人物來了。</p>
<p>世說新語引司馬徽别傳曰：「司馬徽有人倫鑒識，居荊州，知劉表姓暗，必加害善人，乃括囊不談　時人。有以人物問徽，初不辨其高下，每輙言佳。其婦諫曰：「人質所疑，君宜辨論，而不皆言佳，豈人所以咨君之意乎？」徽曰：「如君所言，亦復佳」。」語頗幽默，這眞是一個苟全性命於治世的好方法。德操洵不愧有「水鏡」的稱譽。倘聽「婦人之言」，則恐將爲當時好議論人物的孔北海彌正平之續了。故圓的研究，又可忽乎哉！</p>
<h3>女人的厄運</h3>
<p>— 咏</p>
<p>世上最苦的人，要算中國的女子。</p>
<p>那一班窮苦人家的女子喫朝餐，愁晚飯，瘦骨支離到處討吃着；她們的苦楚，我不忍說，她們的生活譜，是一片模糊的血跡，她們是被歷史的壓力拚棄於人類生活之外的一羣。</p>
<p>那一班富貴之家的女子包括太太，少奶奶，小姐以及花瓶，影星之流；她們着短褲，御長襪，穿高跟鞋，或露着赤腕和胸膛，或裸着肉感的大腿，天天上公司剪衣料，上舞塲跳舞，坐汽車兜風，戲院，公園，賭塲，跑狗塲，回力球塲……這些人慾横流的塲中，終日有着無數摩登男人伴着她們逍遙過日，她們的生活譜我不願說，我不願說這些「描金寄生虫。」</p>
<p>人類幸與不幸的命運就這樣决定了。我們天在看報，總可找到一些大號字的標題，用極其生動的文字描寫着許多關於女人的風流艷事什麽跳大王與孫小姐，美人魚和她的保護人……一類全無價值的紀載，或刊着肉感的玉照給有關的人們歌詠嗟嘆，却没有街頭乞婦的喊聲，骯髒襤褸的影照！市面上只見肉的引誘，色的狂流，却聽不到生的詛咒，死的慘呌！</p>
<p>人們對於肉感風騷之類那麽醉心，對於西洋文明又是提倡的那麽起勁；恰恰相反，社會對於窮愁無計的可憐的女子，却用全力壓迫，使她們化身摩登，犧牲色相，或則流着淚兒站在十字街頭！</p>
<p>這說來多麽寒愴！</p>
<p>雖則富貴的人們站在西洋文明的立塲上鼓着勁兒，暢快地發洩性慾，一般窮苦的女子也利用這社會的弱點，在摩登，健美，……各種新鮮號召之下，今日一個歌舞會，明日一個時裝展覽會，再過一時，又閙一個賽美會，裸體浴的花樣，渺無前路的中國女子，便大家朝着這個方向，討吃那些公子哥兒揮霍的餘餕！但中國畢竟是古色文物之邦，在這洋化的淫蕩之風浪高漲到極點了時，一般舊時代的撑持者，目擊亡國之兆，就來了一個時代的逆襲，那就是「維持風化，」提倡「禮義廉恥。」</p>
<p>昨日本報北平電：「袁良嚴厲禁舞……在三春舞塲逮捕大批舞女及男女舞客。」</p>
<p>前日報載南京在禁娼之後覺得事實上仍是禁不了，又下令開禁了，但檢查却非常嚴厲。</p>
<p>故都新都對於女子看得道般嚴格，禁舞禁娼的政令，是那樣嚇嚇惶惶，動盪於一般賣藝賣色的苦女子的心坎上。這使我們深深感到中國洋化的另一種悲苦是把中國的女人陷落在不能自拔的深淵裏；而且在這深淵裏痛苦呻吟，全然没有社會的同情，社會對於她們没有禮貌，没有敬惜之意，只有調戲，只有摧殘，因襲歷史傳流來下來的壓力，把她們拚棄於人類生活之圈外。</p>
<p>今日這些可憐的没有生路的中國女子墮落下去了，這是事實，若說她們破壞了「風化，」喪失了「禮義廉恥，」這却是極大的寃枉。「風化」和「禮義廉恥」給洋風洋氣掃盪了，她們也被洋風洋氣迷醉了，這個事實，今日的禁舞禁娼的先生們，也應該先認清楚，不要把出賣靈魂的，捧到天上，把出賣肉體的打到地獄，而那些喊呌着「婦女解放萬歲」的人，也應睜開眼睛看看這是不是女人的厄運到臨了的時代。</p>
<h3>芳小姐</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>康府裏的芳小姐，前日打上海學校里回來，身上打扮得十足摩登，和以前鄉下小姐的模樣，判若兩人。因之；隣舍人家都在竊竊私議：「芳小姐近來行動大變了！上海去得没半年，已妖形怪狀了，可見上海眞是壞地方！怪不得她姨娘說她到上海去讀書，完全是裝裝名，實底，是想打上海揀一個小白臉做官人，現在看了她這種「洋禮洋腔」的形狀，她姨娘的話，信非虚語啦，唉！滿好的一個姑娘，會得這樣大變，眞是可惜呢！」一般隣舍人家，都是十八世紀的眼光，對於芳小姐的，這種女學生的，活潑的行爲，入時的裝束，那得不認爲不規則的行動？况且還時常聽信和芳小姐反對的五姨太太的，破壞芳小姐名譽的話，所以：現在大家就異口同聲的，發着這樣批評芳小姐的議論。原來芳小姐是康老爺的幼女，她的母親，是康老爺的第四姨太太，她生得容姿綽的，體態輕盈，一對烏亮亮的眸子，兩個醉人的嫵媚的酒渦，愈增她美麗的風度，所以；Ｘ鎭上的公子哥兒，個個羡慕得神魂顚倒，摩肩接踵地紛紛向康府裏來求婚，但，她的父母，視她如掌上明珠，鍾愛異常，豈肯輕易許人？因之；她一擱就擱到十八歲，還没雀屏中選。她雖嬌養慣的，而性情倒很温存，舉止也落落大方，因爲生長在鄉間，風俗古舊，所以自幼深閨藏嬌，足不出户，一切行動，完全是十八世紀閨閣千金的模樣。康老爺時常反對現代女子的求學，說男女混雜，成何體統？「女子無才便是德」要什麽學問？所以；芳小姐直到十八歲，還没有受過敎育，胸中點墨全無，因之：人家都呼她「繡花枕頭！」不幸去年春間，芳小姐的母親，忽然罹疾身亡！兩個月之後，她父親又討了一位五姨太太，這位五姨太太，是出身窰子，性情浪漫，舉動輕浮，度量又非常隘狹，不論吃的穿的，都尅薄小算，所以一進門，就和芳小姐勢如冰炭，常常發生衝突，背後又慫恿康老爺冷淡女兒，康老爺本是一個糊塗虫，一味愛色，於是把往常愛女兒心理，立時推翻，天天把芳小姐，非打即駡了。五姨暗中又將芳小姐的飲食費用，加以種種的限制和壓迫。這時芳小姐心中悲痛極了，想起母親在日，何等鍾愛？生活上何等舒適？現在母親死了，討了一個「姨娘」進來，父親就瞧不起自己，遭到種種慘苦的壓迫，那麽，這樣一天天的下去，又怎樣挨過呢？况且自己一字不識，智識全無，將來的婚烟問題，也不要受到障礙麽？外加五姨和自己反對，將來父親作主的婚姻，定無好的結果！不如趁此家庭中不能安居的時候，到外界去求學幾年，有了智識，萬事就可自己作主了。她想到這里，心中悲痛極了，不覺嗚嗚咽咽地哭了起來。但，再一想居在家里，終非善策，於是她就在這年夏間，離了家庭，到上海入ＸＸ女校讀書。自從芳小姐到上海去讀書以後，五姨却時常和人們談論，說：「姑娘家年紀大了，心頭也就要活了，上海標緻的人多，她是去招小官人啊，不然年已十八歲，還去讀什麽書？豈不是（八十歲學校吹打，壽長氣短）麽？唉！一個牆門（鄉間大户謂之牆門（小姐，這樣地不要臉，到上海去假讀書，眞是倒盡康家的楣！」所以這次芳小姐打上海學校里回來，一般隣舍，也就說她「行動大變」了。</p>
<h3>論「女性美」底標準</h3>
<p>— 里月</p>
<p>無論是在封建社會，或是資本社會裏，只要是以男子爲中心的制度之下，女人總是往往被當做商品或是玩物。女人旣然是被當成商品或是玩物，自然便也有優劣和美醜之分了。在咱們中國，這種社會裏的女人，以前是拿絶對的「病態」爲優的美的標準。所以在這一標凖底下的典型女人，必定是有着像；「柳枝」的腰，「金蓮」的脚，「瓜子」的臉，「羊脂」的肌。其餘；胸是平平的，頭是低垂的，手是瘦小的，腿是細弱的；眸子要凝住像含着一包秋水，頰上要時常羞答答地飛着朶朶的紅雲；還要多愁多病，弱不勝衣，連一陣微風吹來，都好像要把她們吹折了般的……這是說，愈瘦愈優，越病越美；「病美女」，「瘦佳人」的名兒也就是這樣的生出來了。然而這「美女」「佳人」的生活方式很簡</p>
<p>單，她們只是男姓的長期的奴。</p>
<p>近幾年來，歐美的狂風吹遍了整個中華的大陸，吹透了中華的每個哥兒娘兒們的心。女人的丨丨不，商品的玩物的優和美的標準，就由「病態」而激轉變成爲十足的「妖腔」了！站在這狂風的當頭而自命爲時代女人們，她們都紛紛的就在「妖媚」這一摩登的新標準之下，充分地表現她們妖腔和媚勁。於是，鞋跟高了，屁股扭了，大腿裸了，頭髮捲了，眉毛薙了而又重畫成那麽細，那麽長，那麽烏黑；唇兒像血，乳峯在顫，臉蛋不差於猴子的屁股……這是說，愈妖愈美，越媚越值錢！眞的，事實上表現出來的丨丨特别是在這十里洋塲的上海，表現得最透徹；好些嚴重的事情，以及許多升官發財，飛黃騰達的玩意兒，大抵都是爲了或是靠了這妖腔！這媚勁！所以，自然的，這妖媚在所有的一方面便成了商品，在另一方面就當做是玩物。可是她們的生活方式就不同於「男性的長期的奴」了；她們會吐烟圈子，會成天的吃着糖炒栗子和巧克力，會天天上公司剪衣料，上舞塲跳舞，坐汽車兜風，洋房，公園，戲院，賭場，跑狗場，回力球塲……這些人慾横流的像瘋狂般的場合中，成年有着大羣有閒的像紳士般的摩登男人倍伴着她們逍遙　蕩丨丨她們是描了金的！</p>
<p>……無論在以前，或是現在，這表現，無疑的都是畸形！都是瘋狂！殘暴！慘酷！</p>
<p>然而，女人，矛盾的社會，墮落的制度下商品的玩物的女人，難道除了畸形的「病態」和瘋狂的「妖腔」的表現之外，便再没有其他的方式來表現她們合理的美了嗎？這該是怎麽的不幸啊！</p>
<p>前幾天，在「上海」看了一張性敎育的影片。這影片裏是在表現着女性美的另一典型，這就是和咱們這絶對不同的社會裏，合理的制度下的那些活躍的前進的女性底健美。在那裏的社會裏的女人，一切；與咱們的不同；她們没有「病態」，也没有「妖腔」；她們不瘦，不弱，不媚，不嬌，不畸形，又不瘋狂；她們的生活充滿了沸騰的血，青春的燄，活躍的精神，健美的身體；她們是愉快地和平地在合理的正軌上風馳電行，突飛猛進地向着燦爛的明潔的圈圍駛着！一日千萬里地駛着！</p>
<p>這確實不得不呌我爲着我们的女性們寒愴而悲哀了！我们眞的横着心腸讓我們的民族堕落到一個萬刦不復的慘境嗎？幹着婦女運動的先生們：請問在你們的呼喊「萬歲」和明艷旗幟號召底下的任務是要把女性們都弄成畸形的瘋狂的「病態」和「妖腔」嗎？還是應當要讓她們變成活躍的前進的健美的女姓呢？這些，必須應當認清以後，拿事實來答覆我們的。</p>
<h3>致麗琳</h3>
<p>— 爭青</p>
<p>麗琳：</p>
<p>我倆相識，僅祇短促的二年，可是我對你已有了很深刻的認識，琳，我的確是很愛你的，我愛你感學的靈，敏，舉止的活潑，我愛你的直率，愛你的驕矜，愛你思想的準確，更愛你有樸素的美德而無妖艷的愧態，你有一顆細賦甜心，温柔的方寸，而没有浪漫的俗氣，你有眞眞摩登女性的外形和實際，而没有被外界所謂的摩登所惡化，琳，我是深愛你而不惓的。</p>
<p>可是近以月來你對我冷酷的侮辱，予我以莫大的愴痛，啊！琳，難道我對你的認識是錯誤了呢？琳難道你也是和通俗的女子一般的見界嗎？假使這樣，這予我的愴傷是何等的深刻呀；到何日才能彌補呢？呵！我知道了，像我這樣的窮小子，是根本不配愛什麽姑娘的丨窮小子也有依戀愛的艷福嗎？戀愛根本當以金錢作基礎的。但是，琳，我不當你是一個這樣的女性，我要尊重你女性的人格，你是一個高中的學生，我不相信你會這樣自己肯降低自己的人格！假使這樣你受的是什麽敎育呢？你受的敎育不是像粉刷墻頭一樣嗎？那不是你進學校根本就是誘人的進階罷了，美其名曰是一個中學生，究其量又是一個媚人</p>

<p>近來知道你心中煩惱，琳你的心是矛盾得怪可憐的，琳不過你須認清，即使你自己的環境累你煩惱，你尙須要去和它奮鬥，那何况你的是所謂客觀的環境呀！</p>
<p>時期已成熟到這樣地步，我們什麽話都談過了，所以我萬分地希望你能將你的苦衷告訴我。我可直捷暢快地告訴你，我是一個一貧如洗的窮小子，不過我不希望怎樣致富，我祇希望我能站在時代的最前鋒，至少我們不可落後，我們要盡我們青年應負的職任，我們要認清社會的劣點而加以校正，話說到這裏，就算告了一個叚落，希望你，萬分的希望你，再三的思維，再三的體騐，我終是這樣的默禱你，你是一個中學生，你不負改造的責任，祇少自己總得監督</p>

<h3>亡羊補牢</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>請恕我，在您萬忙中來凟犯您的清神。但是，怎能使我不如此呢？事實是這樣：初中求學的我，因迫於經濟，祇得抛棄了求學的生活。不多時，就在一家公司裏充當了一個收賬員的職務。每月的薪金，倒還堪温飽。俗說：「男大當婚，女大當嫁」，我父親見我的年齡，一些一此的增加，而所謂，「男大當婚」的俗語，還没有實行。但是，毫無餘蓄的我們，在這金錢主議的社會中，怎能辦得起婚事呢？然而，不辦吧又恐怕人家會恥笑「這麽大的兒子，還没有和他成家」。因爲這樣，便向人家借了五百塊錢，娶了一個媳婦，也就是我的妻子。多了一個人，當然開支上又要增加不少。負担一天重似一天，而五百塊錢的婚事費，一點没有把握的人家。眞合俗語說：「討的是借，睡的是債」。度日還是東節西儉，如果再生養了小孩下來，那更怎樣辦呢？開支不是又大了嗎？負担不是更重了嗎？</p>
<p>慈愛的編者先生啊！我誠懇的請求您，爲我解决這我認爲困難的問題。并　請告訴我，爲什麽一般人嫁女兒，像做賣買一般呢？萬分至誠的期待着，先生的回覆。完了。祝您撰安　梁酿岱躬鞠</p>
<p>編者按：梁君最後提出的一個問題，就是說「爲什麽人家嫁女兒，要像做賣買一般呢？」這問題很容易回答，而同時也是很難解决。這當然是目下整個不良社會所造成，並不是少數人可以做到這樣，也並不是少數人可以把他改良的。在我們一般平民，並不是自滅志氣，可是力不從心，大可不必去高談移風易俗的大話。我們對付這種惡劣環境的最好手段，莫妙於採取堅固清野的辦法；你要當好賣買做，我就不來作成你，看你有甚辦法。可憐梁君與其家長，都没有這種精神，連消極抵抗也辦不到。以致於被惡社會拖人下水，墮入苦海。此乃木已成舟，悔亦不及爲今之計，祇有補救的途境了。積極方面，當然要努力於收入的增加；學識經騐以及充份利用機會等均是。消極方面，當然要求支出的節省；衣食住行，没有一件不要加以緊縮。而且最好在最近的將來年，紀尙輕，生產力没有辦法的時候，實行節　亨　得兒立　行之後，應符合　困難。至於節育的適黨辦法，應該去　計於名　，　中　　，非但靠不住，而且很危險。並且　爲生　的關係，很少各人可以用很的方法。</p>

<h3>上海（二九）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（四十二）　我明白了</p>
<p>上海的風雲一天緊似一天，人心惶惶，一如大戰就要開始似的。華租界的地方，衣箱，行李，市民，分不清的向租界内擁擠，好像遲一步砲彈就要燒上他們的屁鼓。接連的内戰，市民的託庇於帝國主義的洋勢力下已成了習慣，租界上的人口增加，房價飛漲，戰爭也造一部份的原因。</p>
<p>我們的學校停辦了，雜誌停版了，一切的一切都停頓，除了我們每天還要吃飯。</p>
<p>這天的下午，我舅父徐炳南的女兒我表姊徐慧琴送一汽車行李到社中來，她問我這裏可否有堆一堆的地方，等爸爸租定房子之後馬上搬過去。</p>
<p>「舅舅還在徐家匯？」</p>
<p>「爸爸本不預備逃」表姊點點頭「今天汽車夫阿根說ＸＸ書院已駐紮了日本兵，不過爸爸的身體不能過於勞動，他要我先把貴重物件存寄在你這裏，待風聲緊急的時候再走。」</p>
<p>「那也好。」我高聲喊了聲阿福「帮阿根把行李搬到三層樓上去。」</p>
<p>「三層樓？放到那裏去？」</p>
<p>「敏姊走了，她房間空着。」</p>
<p>「逃鄉下去了？這末小的鼠膽！」她笑，我也笑。</p>
<p>「搬好了行李再說罷。」小黃的聲音那樣高。</p>
<p>阿福帮着阿根將行李搬運到三層樓上，平時一間整潔的臥房，現在已像一個貨艙了，對於豪放女子的踪蹟没有一些遺留的影像給我們，然而慧還蒙在幕的背後。</p>
<p>三個人下樓來同到我們臥室裏，小黃不再怕見公婆的醜媳一樣，第一個發言。</p>
<p>「徐小姐，你太應該將孫敏趕走！」</p>
<p>「黃先生，你不能做女人的夢了。」表婶以爲小黃不會說正經話的，仍是嬉笑着調侃他。</p>
<p>「哼！你侮辱我！」他舉起拳頭向空中一揮，似乎要打倒什麽對象似的。</p>
<p>我沉默着。表姊不理會小黃。</p>
<p>「敏幾時走的？」她問我</p>
<p>「近一個月了吧？」</p>
<p>表姊疑惑地望着小黃綳緊像鼓一般的臉。</p>
<p>「爲了你一封信！」哈哈的炸彈。</p>
<p>「弟弟？」</p>
<p>「就是兩行鉛筆字。」我淡淡的回答。</p>
<p>「那不是我預料的事。」慧姊低低的說。「弟弟自從黃先生打趣的下一天，敏到徐家匯來，她說她是不能結婚的女子，她不會談戀愛，因爲自己不承認是女子，這類打趣的事，便成了家常便飯。此後你生病了，我們談話的機會很多，敏從没有吐露她的意思。」慧姊停了停，再去望望小黃的臉，接着說：「弟弟，戀愛的道上本没有第三者插足的餘地，旣然如此，我决定尋敏回來，我不願意做他人不願意的事」慧姊站起身來就要走的樣子。</p>
<p>「徐小姐，現在是什麽時候了，現在不是戀愛的時候，孫敏也决不會回來。如其能有機會，我們應該做一點帮助國家的事，也顯出我們民衆的力量」。小黃一字一字的說，好像說上一句的時候，預備下一句的措詞，在平時這般的說話態度，表姊第一個要笑出來。</p>
<p>這時候我第一次瞧見她嚴肅的臉，聽了小黃的話，半嚮没有開口，最後站起來說：「我明白了。」</p>
<p>「我們的同志！」小黃的手舉了起來，脚跟一并。</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Education and the Countryside (Shu)</h3>
<p>The fundamental meaning of education lies first in cultivating the virtue of each educated individual, and second, in accumulating profound knowledge. Those who have received higher education are bound to be leaders of society, their words, actions, and intellect all influencing the overall direction of society.  Our country has imported Western culture and established new education for decades. While it cannot be said that there have been absolutely no contributions to the advancement of modern civilization and the future of the nation, the actual effect is minimal.  If we examine various institutions across China, we find a common lament about the lack of talent and the difficulty of finding truly capable people. At the same time, there are unemployed graduates everywhere, with people not using what they have learned, a common occurrence. The sigh of insufficient specialized talent often comes from those in charge. Is this contradictory phenomenon truly the case?</p>
<p>The lack of universal education in our country is universally recognized, leaving no room for denial.  The average illiteracy rate in rural areas is over 95 percent. Even in cities with developed transportation and modern industrial organizations, the general cultural level is very low. This is undoubtedly a heavy responsibility that those who have received higher education should bear. However, according to a recent report by the Ministry of Education's inspector of the six major universities in Shanghai, the assessment of moral education is mostly, "Most are accustomed to luxury and extravagance... their physical condition tends toward weakness..." Only Datong University is a rare exception, being "relatively simple." If this is the case, then what is the danger of the current educational phenomenon in China and the youth who will bear the important responsibilities of the country and society in the future? If the whole country is like this, then the decline of the Chinese nation will be immediate. Ask how important this relationship is. From historical traditions, our country has developed the habit of studying to become an official. It seems that the only path for scholars is to become officials. After the recent import of liberal ideas from Europe, the idea of becoming an official has gradually shifted towards engaging in industry and commerce. However, this kind of industry and commerce is mostly concentrated in large cities, and the academic community has not been able to deeply study industrial and commercial knowledge, and make a bold leap forward along the path of practical needs.</p>
<p>Judging from the actual trend of the situation, the main reason for the development of large cities in our country is not the development of industry, but the transfer of commerce. At present, Chinese cities are almost purely sales outlets for foreign-made products. The foundation of this prosperity is extremely fragile, and what is more, speculation is prevalent. All that is done is equivalent to the entry and exit of empty heads, which is not only unrelated to industry, but also unrelated to the construction of the entire national economy. If the tidal wave of a global economic panic arrives, there will be no ability to support oneself at all. Although financial capital is developing upwards, the result will only be to suffer shocks together and let it change naturally. Education centered on urban development will cause the intelligence cultivated to also wither due to the economic decline of the city. As for the cultivation of character and the development of morality, there is even less time to discuss them. If this situation continues without reform, I am afraid that our country's education will fall into the same trap as a colonial economy.</p>
<p>Agriculture is the foundation of our country. Although modern industry has seen some development, its historical roots and the foundation of its economic organization cannot be changed in a short period of time. Moreover, advanced industrial countries such as England and Germany are also striving for economic self-sufficiency and never slacken in agricultural management. Our country is originally a raw material exporting country, so how can we starve ourselves at this time without seeking ways to adapt to the countryside? The key to seeking ways to adapt to the countryside lies entirely in education. Therefore, in addition to striving to implement universal education, our country's education policy today should strive to correct old habits and ensure that the curriculum is appropriate to the needs of the countryside. It is also necessary to pay attention to how those who have received education can return to their hometowns to work. In this way, education and the countryside, which are in a dangerous situation, will have a chance to be reborn, and the pain of unemployment can also be gradually resolved.</p>
<p>Although specialized education is different in nature, the future of the talents it cultivates does not necessarily have to be in the countryside, so it seems that there is no need to pay attention to the countryside. However, under the current circumstances in our country, no career can be separated from the bankrupt economic situation. Therefore, at least a real understanding of today's rural economy should be possessed, experiencing the suffering of the farmers and developing a spirit of devotion to society. Only then will there be hope for their own career prospects and will it have meaning for national education. Therefore, to save the crisis in education, it is necessary to restore the vitality of young people. In school education, in addition to intellectual cultivation, the cultivation of virtue must not be neglected. The simplicity and honesty of our country's farmers is indeed a major condition for shouldering great responsibilities. Moreover, their ability to endure hardship, their perseverance, and their continued efforts even after a long period of time, this kind of beauty of the farmers should be instilled into the actions of young students. This is what must be paid attention to in education. In short, focusing on urban education has revealed various malpractices. The way to save it is first to import the simple nature of farmers to alleviate the current superficiality, and second, to improve the knowledge and skills of farmers to promote the development of the rural economy.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Decides to Abolish the Additional Tax on Field Tax</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Bing, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, said that when Minister Kong took office, he had the greatest determination to abolish the additional tax on fields. Now the Ministry has formulated measures to strive for implementation. In the future, the losses suffered by local governments due to the reduction in tax revenue will be compensated by the central government. As for the issue of levying inheritance tax, the Ministry is planning it, but in order to adapt to the Chinese environment, it intends to gradually realize it. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Supervisory Yuan, based on the people's accusations from various provinces that the additional tax on fields exceeds the regular tax, is drafting a memorandum of opinion, preparing to ask the central government to find a way to rectify it, and has appointed commissioners Zhou Lisheng, etc. to review it. It is reported that the result of the review is that everyone believes that the additional taxes in various provinces have numerous names. In addition to the additional tax, there are various exorbitant taxes such as field tax and security tax. Most of them exceed ten times the regular tax, which not only increases the burden on the people, but also violates central laws and regulations. Therefore, it is decided that cases of accusations of additional tax on fields must be impeached in accordance with the law in the future, and it is suggested that the central government quickly find a way to clean up the additional tax on fields in various provinces under the principles of reducing the burden on the people and not violating central laws and regulations in order to prevent malpractices.

<h3>Japanese Envoy Will Not Return Home Temporarily</h3>

Chaisan Electric Ping said that Suzuki can arrive in Shanghai before January 2, and he will return north from Shanghai on the 4th. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Paris Becomes the Diplomatic Center of Europe</h3>
<p>France Actively Contacts Satellites</p>
<p>To Counter the Political Alliance of Italy and Germany</p>
<p>(Paris) Reuters has learned today that at this critical moment of the European situation, the French government is actively adopting a policy of contacting friendly countries and strengthening friendship. Foreign Minister Bibi arrived here today and will meet with French Foreign Minister Peng Gu tomorrow, and the King of Yugoslavia will also officially visit Paris in January. It is estimated that the King of Romania will follow suit. In February, Peng Gu will visit Prague and Warsaw, or go to the capitals of Yugoslavia and Romania, which is also unknown. The French authorities hope to establish a strong group on the issue of disarmament and the League of Nations. The Greek diplomatic authorities met with Peng Gu today to discuss the Balkan Peace Organization and other events. (Reuters telegram on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Discussing the Current Situation, Foreign Minister Bibi of Greece Visits Peng Gu</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Himeng of Greece came to France from Beijing and arrived here at 6:40 p.m. yesterday and met with Foreign Minister Peng Gu this morning. (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Greek Foreign Minister Maximos met with Foreign Minister Peng Gu at 5:15 p.m. When he came out to the reporters, he only said, "Foreign Minister Peng Gu and I have made a comprehensive observation of the international situation, paying special attention to the Balkan situation. Both of us believe that the governments of all countries should do their best to build peace in the Balkans and Europe." In the afternoon, Maximos also met with Turkish Ambassador to France Suad. Mr. Maximos plans to stay in Paris for five or six days before going to Rome to visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Havas telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Greek Foreign Minister Maximos's visit to France was originally a private tour. His visit to Foreign Minister Peng Gu today was purely a courtesy. However, during the conversation between the two, they inevitably touched on the Balkan situation and other broader issues. Peng Gu must have approved of Maximos's recent meeting with the Yugoslav authorities, because the stability and rapprochement policy of Eastern European countries has been initiated by Greece and Turkey. After the Greek Foreign Minister has contacted the authorities of the South, it should be further advanced. In addition, Maximos's meeting with Turkish Ambassador to France Suad reminds people of the relationship between Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria. Moreover, when meeting with Peng Gu, Greek Minister to France Boris was also present. Boris is an important figure in the League of Nations. Although his participation in the meeting was a diplomatic courtesy, the issue of League of Nations reform must have been involved at least. (Havas telegram on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Simon Will Meet in Rome on the 3rd of Next Month</h3>
<p>Cape Gali According to verification, British Foreign Minister Simon will stay here until January 3. As for Captain Roehm, the commander of the German National Socialist Party's army, and Hanmona, the police chief of Preislau, arrived here before Simon and have now left here and returned to Rome. (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Labour Party's newspaper "Daily People's Voice", Foreign Minister Simon and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will probably meet on January 3 next year. The army also speculated on the content of the talks between the British and Italian representatives, saying that the Italian Prime Minister will do his best to persuade Simon to believe that the only way to break the current deadlock is to resort to the Four-Power Pact. The Italian newspapers believe that the role of the Four-Power Pact is not only to prepare for the work of Geneva, but also to replace the work of Geneva. These views are all contrary, because the provisions of the Four-Power Pact clearly stipulate that the application of the pact should be within the scope of the League of Nations. If Mussolini can abide by this principle and declare that all resolutions should be made by the Disarmament Conference, then it may be worth trying to hold talks between the four countries of England, France, Italy and Germany, but it is unknown whether Mussolini will take this path, and if so, what will Germany do.

<h3>The French Cabinet Considers a Reply to Germany</h3>
<p>Direct Negotiations Are Rejected</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held an important meeting this afternoon to consider how to respond to the German Prime Minister Hitler's recent proposal for direct disarmament negotiations between France and Germany. What can be predicted now is that although the French government is prepared to continue research negotiations through diplomatic channels, it will reject direct negotiations. (Reuters telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The ministers of the three departments of the army, navy, and air force held a meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Xu Dang. The discussion was about the relations between France and Germany, especially the issue of German rearmament. The German Prime Minister Hitler once expressed this to the French Ambassador to Germany Ponse. All the ministers opposed the direct negotiations between the French and German Prime Ministers, and advocated that the French Ambassador to Germany Ponse should still be in the middle to inquire about the news.</p>

<h3>Disarmament Achievements Are Unlikely, Switzerland Expands Its Military</h3>
<p>Spends Huge Sums to Add Weapons</p>
<p>To Prevent Germans from Entering France Under False Pretenses</p>
<p>The transformation of the army into a militia is a model for all of Europe</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Swiss Federal Council has decided to spend 82 million Swiss francs (approximately US$25 million) to expand its military strength and reform its army. This sum is planned to be allocated continuously over 25 years for the purchase of airplanes, tanks, artillery, machine guns, automobiles, etc. It is planned that in the future, each battalion will be equipped with six heavy machine guns, and other military equipment will also be increased or reformed. In addition, 80 new-style aircraft will be purchased in 25 years to supplement the existing 175 aircraft. Switzerland urgently decided to expand its military during the Disarmament Conference because it discovered that Germany had a plan to pass through Switzerland under false pretenses when it fought France in the future, and it was expected that the Disarmament Conference would not be able to achieve anything. The Swiss army is a conscript army and is actually one of the most elite armies in Europe. It is composed of 300 highly trained officers who form the cadre. It trains approximately 25,000 newly recruited civilians each year and provides advanced training to 250,000 conscripted civilians. The Disarmament Conference plans to transform the armies of Europe into militias, using Switzerland as a model. (National telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador to the United States Takes Office</h3>

<h3>The Soviet Union Restores Diplomatic Relations with the United States and Strengthens Its Anti-Japanese Policy</h3>
<p>Moscow Newspaper Refutes Japanese Rumors</p>
<p>It is Inaccurate That Russia Will Lease Sakhalin Island to the United States</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Changchun telegram of the Japanese News Agency said that after the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic relations with the United States, its anti-Japanese policy became more and more effective. The Truth Newspaper commented on this, "Only those who try their best to destroy peace and only the most reactionary Japanese military circles can be afraid of the possible goodwill of the Soviet Union, the United States, and China on the issue of the Far East policy. It is precisely this fear of normal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union, the United States, and China that forces such reckless adventurers to cast (at least to a limited extent) absurd news. The Asahi Shimbun will then publish the "true report" from Changchun, falsely claiming that the Soviet government agreed to lease Sakhalin to the United States for 30 years. The Soviet government's "Izvestia" newspaper commented on this, "The spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs admitted that this false report was "serious" on the one hand, while saying that "whether the report he received was "good money" was quite hesitant." Because he suspected that this was a rumor fabricated by the White Russians in Harbin, Izvestia said that the unfortunate spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was finally in a great panic, and in the conclusion, he asked the following question: "Who does not know that this trap is that Harbin "picked up the seal from its Tokyo owner to receive "good money"", and at the same time, according to the regulations, the Tokyo owner must also accept the "counterfeit money" cast by the White Russian mint in Harbin in the same way.

(China United Press telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the Japan-India negotiations recently gradually progressed to the time of a grand reunion, the Governor of Boya, India, suddenly claimed that he would protect domestic industries from the offensive of exchange rate declines, and suddenly submitted a proposal to the Indian Parliament on the 23rd to increase the tariffs on miscellaneous goods. This matter gave the Japanese government and people a major shock and cast a dark shadow on the Japan-India negotiations. The British Embassy was aware of this situation, and at 11 a.m. on the 26th, it specially sent Commercial Officer McCrae to visit Kurasu, Director of the Commerce Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to explain the reasons. Director Kurasu then invited Yoshino, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Kuroda, Director of the Trade Department, and Wakamatsu, Commercial Secretary, to convey the British Commercial Officer's statement at 2 p.m., and planned to first solicit the opinions of the people in the industry before deciding on the final policy that Japan should adopt.

<h3>The Japanese Government Is Considering Reorganizing the South Manchuria Railway</h3>

While on the train, he told reporters, "The plan to reorganize the South Manchuria Railway has been reported to the various official departments, so after the central government studies it, there will be a specific plan. However, I do not know the content of it. In short, I am convinced that it will not hinder the inflow of capital into Manchuria. If the South Manchuria Railway needs it, it will only express its opinions to the central government, so it is difficult to say whether the reorganization plan will be submitted to the Parliament."

<h3>Finance Is on the Verge of Collapse, the Pseudo Government Raises Debt to Build Railways</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The Pseudo-Manchukuo has decided to entrust the South Manchuria Railway Company to build three railway lines starting next year, but the finances are difficult, and it plans to issue public bonds of 11.8808 million yuan to cover the expenses. However, the economy of the Eastern Province has been on the verge of collapse since the September 18th Incident, and wealthy merchants have also declined. Moreover, at this time, when the relations between Japan and Russia are also deteriorating, it is difficult to sell the public bonds, so it is planned that the Pseudo-Central Bank and the South Manchuria Railway Company will bear the shortfall.

<p>Montevideo The seventh Pan-American Conference here has closed today. US Secretary of State Hull's report to the State Department on the conference is quite hopeful, saying that the feelings of the countries of the New World are now far better than in the past thirty years.

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Forces Growing in Xinglong County</h3>

<p>(Beiping) A person from Xinglong reported that the Japanese and puppet forces in the county are growing daily, and there is little hope of recovery.

The anti-revolutionary elements in Fujian are active in Tianjin in secret, and strict precautions have been taken. The Yellow River flood is extremely tragic, and the provincial government has decided to raise funds to build dikes.

<h3>Director of Shandong Reconstruction Department Plans to Rescue Coal Industry</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Director of the Reconstruction Department Zhang Honglie and Qian Chengxu, standing committee member of the Shanghai Federation of Labor Unions, returned to Jinan from Qingdao today. Zhang said that he went to Qingdao to discuss the rescue of the coal industry in the province with Mayor Shen. He invited coal mine operators to a meeting in Qingdao, and it was decided that coal mine operators should combine production and sales and form a capital company in Boshan. An office will be set up in Shanghai to promote sales. The Qingshanfu, this department, and coal mine operators will each send two representatives to Boshan on the 29th to discuss the establishment of the company and set a deadline of one month for its formation. If it is not formed by the deadline, the government will take over.

Qian Chengxu has prepared a plan to revive Shandong's production, arguing that the lack of cooperation between production and sales is the reason for Shandong's industrial downturn. To remedy this, the government should identify policies and implement easy-to-implement measures: (1) Establish a Shandong Production Revival Committee, and appoint Zhang Gongquan and Yan Qingxiang for cotton and wheat, and Liu Hongsheng and Xu Xinliu for coal and oil to organize; (2) Establish a cotton warehouse in Jinan, operated with official funds, to improve the quality of goods; (3) Establish a yarn factory in Weixian to resist foreign goods.

<h3>Guo Chuntao Talks About Land Policy</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Guo Chuntao of the National Economic Council said that the land policy has been discussed several times by the Central Political Council, but there has been no concrete decision. When some people talk about this issue, it involves distribution. In my opinion, instead of doing something that is difficult to implement, it is better to start with reorganization. The current central government policy is roughly as follows: 1. To enable those who cultivate the land to own it; 2. To provide capital to those who own land but lack capital through farmers' banks to purchase new agricultural implements and improve management methods; 3. To levy progressive taxes to prevent land from being concentrated in the hands of a few landlords. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>

The political militia in Xinye is better, but the various administrations in Fangcheng have not been established.

<h3>Suppressing Bandits: Sichuan Army's Deng and Tian Hesitate and Don't Advance</h3>
<p>—Bandit Suppression Support Association Cables Urging Dispatch of Troops—</p>
<p>Chengdu Dispatch: Recently, the military operations of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Route Armies in suppressing bandits have made great progress. The 5th Route Army has successively recovered Xuanhan and Suiding, and the 4th Route Army under Yang Sen has also recaptured Yingpeng. However, the 1st and 2nd Route Armies under Deng and Tian are still hesitant and not advancing, which greatly hinders the suppression of the Red Army. The Sichuan Bandit Suppression People's Support Association yesterday (the 20th) specifically sent a cable urging the two Commanders Deng and Tian to quickly advance and cut off the bandits' retreat to achieve the effect of encirclement and suppression. The Pacification Committee, on the 18th, jointly sent a circular telegram to various armies, severely criticizing those who were unwilling to seriously and quickly suppress the bandits. Furthermore, the An Chuan Bandit Suppression Promotion Association and others also sent a cable to Xiang and other generals on the 20th, making representations. The various telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Deng and Tian: Urgent to Commanders Deng in Zhaohua and Guangyuan, and Commander Tian of Sichuan: According to reports, Commander Tian’s telegram stated that because the 1st Route Army did not take over the Zhaoguang defense, the 2nd Route Army could not move to the right. The true situation is difficult to fathom. We have just received the good news that Xuanhan and Suiding have been successively recovered, and the bandit army is fleeing in panic. We urge you to take advantage of the situation to advance and cut off the bandits’ retreat to achieve the effect of encirclement and suppression. The safety of the situation in Sichuan hinges on this one action. The situation is urgent. Please act quickly. This is respectfully telegraphed for your consideration and reply. Sichuan Bandit Suppression People's Support Association bows.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Pacification Committee: (Above omitted) In the past two months, the main force of the bandits has been concentrated in the lower eastern areas. First Xuanhan and Suiding, then Yingpeng. Our army has repeatedly engaged in battle, bravely resisting the enemy. The areas previously lost have gradually been recovered. If all the armies can advance simultaneously and attack the bandits, then Zhaoguang, Jian, Min, Cangyi, Nan, and other counties would have long been cleared. According to investigations, some use the militia as the vanguard while the army stays in the rear; some soldiers stubbornly guard the rivers while the generals leisurely stay in the cities; some raise funds in peacetime, claiming to be running several state-owned enterprises, but once it comes to suppressing bandits, they use the transfer or retention of a small number of troops to procrastinate and shift responsibility to each other. In summary, the situation is regrettable. Now the bloody battles in Suiding and Xuanhan have started again. Regardless of which army, if they continue to harbor selfish motives, allow the bandits to run rampant, and act perfunctorily, unwilling to seriously and quickly suppress the bandits, then the people of Sichuan have awakened and are no longer afraid to speak out and blame. If they are truly as afraid of the bandits as of tigers, that would be shameful. Or if they harbor bandits to increase their own importance... The proverb says, "Honest advice is unpleasant to the ear but benefits conduct." We offer our sincere advice and hope you will understand. Pacification Committee bows.</p>
<p>Telegram to Liu Xiang: Commander-in-Chief Liu Xiang in Chengdu (remaining titles omitted), and others: As the Red bandits have fled to Sichuan, the northeast has fallen, the dead are stacked like pillows, and the living are displaced. In the past seven or eight months, the bad news has been spreading, and terror has been increasing. You were ordered to suppress the bandits and dispatched six routes of troops. Earlier, we received the good news of the victory at Kaijiang, and the entire occupied area was recovered. The hearts of the people of Sichuan were greatly gladdened. If each route took advantage of the victory to attack in separate directions, how difficult would it be to wipe them out in one fell swoop? But now it has been more than a month. Recent reports indicate that some armies are only thirty to fifty li away from the bandits at the front line but have not launched a single fierce attack. A long night invites dreams; this is truly alarming. The Red bandits, with their newly arrived forces, have seized more than a dozen counties. Each day they occupy strengthens their grip and further anesthetizes the hearts of some of the people. The firmer their base, the more difficult it becomes to attack. This is a clear and obvious principle. Now the armies are slow to advance, claiming to be consolidating their positions, but Jiangxi has been disturbed for several years. Can Sichuan withstand such a long-term disturbance? Furthermore, if this goes on for too long, the Red bandits will grow stronger. In the event that they exploit our weakness and break through at one point, those of you who are far away will be unable to provide timely rescue. If one route collapses, all routes will flee. In the past, the armies of the nine military governors were defeated at Hebei, and the forces of the seven states were turned back at Hangu Pass. Comparing the past with the present, is there any difference? When we think of this, can we even ask about the situation in Sichuan? Moreover, today's grain prices are so low that the income from a year's rent is not enough to pay the pre-collected taxes. The countryside has already gone bankrupt. Although four million yuan was raised earlier, it is still difficult to collect now. If the bandits are not pacified for a long time and taxes are levied again, the disaster of the roving bandits in the late Ming Dynasty will likely spread throughout Sichuan, which will be even more severe than the Red bandits. What is worrying is that some push forward while others retreat, some look ahead while others look back. The rumors flying around seem to have some basis. Your ancestors' graves are located here. If this great disaster is pacified early, the homeland will depend on it. We earnestly hope that you will unite and work together to advance fiercely. We can't help but look forward to this. These are urgent words, so please understand. Chengdu Bandit Suppression An Chuan Promotion Association, Provisional Public Security Maintenance Association, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and various people bow.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yitang Breaks Away from the Third Party</h3>
<p>Zhang Was a Central Committee Member of the Third Party</p>
<p>Declares the Fujian Incident is Ultimately Doomed to Failure</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Zhang Yitang, a member of the Central Committee of the Third Party, was one of the responsible leaders in the Central Committee. The Workers' and Peasants' Party, which evolved from the Third Party, was initiated and organized by Zhang, and he was also the drafter of its declaration. After Deng Yanda was arrested, he traveled to Qin and Lu to engage in activities. When Li Shucheng was the Director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, he was introduced to Hubei and appointed as the Director of the Provincial Relief Institute, a position he held until today. Prior to this, during the large-scale arrest of reactionaries due to the Fujian Incident, Zhang was also arrested and interrogated by the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital. He confessed the errors in his political line and issued a declaration renouncing the party. The original text is as follows: "Compatriots, comrades, in order to revive the revolution and liberate the nation, I once worked hard and struggled diligently for the Third Party, participated in the First Central Committee of the Third Party, and worked in the Propaganda Committee. However, the facts of several years have completely disappointed me. First, Tan Pingshan and Deng Yanda competed for leadership, using all means of instigation, alienation, deception, and exclusion. Second, under the slogan of the so-called anti-rectification movement, bureaucratic politicians, bandits, and warlords—in short, as long as they could disrupt order, disturb the local area, and resist the central government, regardless of their role for the country and the nation, they were all colluded with as much as possible. Third, in theory, they stood between the Three Principles of the People and Marxism, fully demonstrating their contradictory and wavering heart. In order to correct these errors, I worked hard to study and fought fiercely with Tan Pingshan and others, organizing the Workers' and Peasants' Party, and I drafted the program. However, under the current circumstances in our country, the Workers' and Peasants' Party has no way out and is no different from the Chinese Revolutionary Party. To maintain its existence, it also depends on warlords. The more so-called thorough its thinking, the more it objectively becomes an appendage of the Communist Party. Comrades, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution has already come to close quarters. The movements of the Third Party, the Workers' and Peasants' Party, and the Social Democratic Party can only serve to please the Communist Party, deceive young people, split the country, and disrupt society. Looking at the Fujian Incident this time, at a time when the world is criticizing our country for being disorganized, the rebels openly changed the era name and formed a government to resist the central government. At a time when internal and external troubles are pressing and unity and peace are needed, the rebels do not hesitate to fight a civil war by colluding with the Communist Party for the sake of the rights of a few. Is this not a violent act of destroying the nation and ruining the country? Those with even a little conscience, how could they bear to do this? The Fujian rebels fantasize about replaying the story of the alliance with the Communist Party to overthrow the central government, but they have forgotten the lessons of the February Revolution in Russia and the failure of the Social Revolutionary Party, especially the tragedies of the riots in the two Lakes and Guangzhou in the fifteenth and sixteenth years [of the Republic, 1926 and 1927]. The Fujian rebels attempt to use ambitious military men, but the seizure of fire by ambitious military men born of the concept of power and territory will become a head-on blow to them. The rebels dream even more of uniting various parties to increase their strength, but in the history of world political movements, experience proves that the complexity within Fujian and its sharp struggles are strong facts that will inevitably lead to failure. As for the rebels' weak military strength, financial difficulties, and the poverty of the local area, etc., these are especially their fatal crises. Therefore, the Fujian rebellion, besides failure, only serves to strengthen the enemy, prolong internal strife, lose international credibility, and even provoke opportunism and attacks from imperialists. In other words, the Fujian rebellion will only further fragment the country and endanger the nation. Comrades, compatriots, there is only one path to national revival: that is, spiritual unity, strengthening the central government, strengthening national power, and striving to resist foreign aggression. This great and arduous mission can only be accomplished under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, which has a long history and brilliant brilliance. Hesitating young people, comrades, the moment of life and death for the nation has arrived. Time does not allow for a moment's hesitation. Immediately return to the ranks of the Three Principles of the People! Former Central Committee Member of the First Chinese Revolutionary Party, Zhang Yitang." (26th)</p>
<h3>Poison Manufacturing Facility Cracked in Huanggang County, Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Extremely Large Scale, with Morphine as the Main Product</p>
<p>Four Criminals Arrested, All Stolen Goods Sent to the Province</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: A large-scale poison manufacturing facility was cracked in Sujiazu, Huanggang County, at the beginning of this month. Four criminals have been arrested successively, and all the stolen goods were escorted to the province on the 26th, and the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs immediately submitted them to the Provincial Government for review and instructions on how to handle them. Previously, the head of the joint defense in Yangluo Town discovered several unfamiliar people in Xindian Township on the 4th of this month, living together in a secluded house, acting suspiciously. He reported this to the Sixth District Chief Zhu Yi, who led the district guards to conduct a secret investigation, but there were no signs. When they investigated the Sujiazu area on the lakeside connected to the 261st and 262nd Bao [group of households] , they saw a large secluded house, where several people dressed in modern style clothing, aged about twenty or thirty, were working behind the house. Suspecting them of being rebels, they returned to the district and ordered Tao Jiankui, the head of the joint defense in Yangluo Town, to dispatch district guards and Ding [local order-keepers] to search the area at dawn on the 5th. They cracked this large-scale poison manufacturing facility. However, the main criminals had already fled upon hearing the news. Three people, namely the chief steward Sun Xinwei, Zhang Jinhong, and Jiang Wanlou, were arrested on the spot. Subsequently, the main criminal Yuan Jinzhang was also arrested. They were all sent to the county government. County Magistrate Zhu Baosan immediately detained Sun and others and ordered the seized machinery and drugs to be escorted to the prefecture for inventory and storage. At the same time, he telegraphed the Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions. The Department of Civil Affairs, upon receiving the report, considered the case to be serious and immediately telegraphed County Magistrate Zhu to send someone to escort them to the province for investigation and handling. He dispatched Zhu Yi, the Chief of the Sixth District, and Wang Shu and Wan Guohua, officials from the county government, along with twenty armed soldiers from the security team, to escort all the machinery and drugs to the province on the 26th, where they were handed over to the Department of Civil Affairs for inventory and safekeeping. The Department of Civil Affairs sent the drugs and raw materials to the Provincial Hospital for testing. The results showed that only a small portion contained narcotics, while the rest were raw materials for manufacturing morphine. The four criminals who were arrested are still being held in the county, awaiting interrogation. Meng Guangpeng, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, has approved three items: (1) Commend and reward those who contributed to the cracking of the case, with the funds to be advanced from the anti-smoking income; (2) Interrogate and handle the criminals in accordance with the regulations for investigating and banning narcotic drugs; (3) Seal up the seized raw materials with their original markings and submit them to the Provincial Government for review and instructions on how to handle them. The poison manufacturing machinery will be displayed in a selected location for public viewing. (26th)</p>

<h3>Rampant Bandits in Runan</h3>
<p>The 8th District Security Team Suffers Defeat in Suppression</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Officers and Soldiers Killed, Two Hundred Guns Lost</p>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The bandit gangs of Huo Guodong and Yang Xiaohei in Yu [Henan] province are running rampant in the eastern and southern counties of Henan, burning and looting dozens of villages and killing countless people. Although the authorities have repeatedly sent troops to suppress them, when there are many soldiers, the bandits turn large gangs into small groups to evade capture; when there are few soldiers, they unite their forces to resist, hoping to seize weapons. According to a person from Runan, on the 18th of this month, Chen Bojia, the Commander of the 8th District Security Force, sent his chief of staff Yang Zengkui to lead one company each from the security forces of Xiping, Suiping, Zhengyang, and Shangcai counties, three companies from Runan County, and one platoon from Queshan County, totaling more than 600 men, to search and suppress the remaining bandits in the area bordering Runan and Xiangcheng, including Damazhuang, Mitosi, and Sheqiao. They captured more than 20 people along the way and seized dozens of guns. When they arrived near Yangbu, they received a report from Xincai County that more than 2,000 bandits from the gangs of Huo Guodong, Yang Xiaohei, Li Furen, and Zhang Xueliang were fleeing towards Runan. They immediately dispatched troops to intercept them. Unexpectedly, the bandits' plainclothes sentries had already reached the east gate of Yangbu, intending to attack the officers and soldiers from the rear. After being discovered, they immediately divided their troops to drive them back. Then the bandits launched a large-scale attack. The officers and soldiers fought bravely, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the bandits several times. Staff Officer Yang, realizing that the enemy outnumbered them, ordered the Suiping Security Team to bypass and attack the bandits from the rear, launching a surprise attack from both sides. However, the bandits launched a fierce cavalry charge, counter-attacking to the rear of the officers and soldiers. As a result, more than 600 men were surrounded. They relied on a desperate breakout and temporarily retreated to Yangbu Stockade to hold firm. Unexpectedly, the bandits had already infiltrated the stockade and colluded with the local ruffians, creating disturbances and causing chaos. Gunfire broke out everywhere, and the order was disrupted. The bandits outside the stockade took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. Yang Zengkui was killed by a bullet during the internal and external attacks. With no one in command, the troops scattered. Hu Jiwu, the captain of the Runan Security Company, led more than a dozen soldiers to hold a blockhouse to the death. Eventually, because it was difficult to support the building alone, they were captured and killed. In this battle, the losses included Staff Officer Yang Zengkui, Captain Hu Jiwu, and several other officers, more than thirty soldiers killed, several officers, including Li Chunguan, and several dozen soldiers captured, and several officers, including Liao Xiangfan, and dozens of soldiers seriously wounded, for a total loss of about 200 guns. It is said that the bandits also suffered heavy casualties. On the 20th, Liu Fengqi's 13th Cavalry Brigade and Liu Huixin's Brigade of the 11th Route rushed to the scene. The bandits began to flee to the territory of Taihe County in Anhui Province. (December 24th)</p>
<h3>Shandong's Notorious Bandit Wang Ziming Captured</h3>
<p>—Executed by Firing Squad After Interrogation—</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Wang Ziming, a notorious bandit in eastern Shandong, had hundreds of men under his command. He roamed through Zhucheng, Anqiu, Linqu, and Shangmi for seven or eight years, as famous and ruthless as Zhang Heilian in southern Shandong. The people of eastern Shandong watched him with fear. In the past two years, due to the vigorous bandit suppression efforts by the local troops and militias in the province, large and small bandit gangs have been wiped out one after another. Wang Zhiqi, Hao Mingzhu, and others have all been brought to justice. A reward of 10,000 yuan was offered for Wang Ziming's capture. Wang, realizing that it was difficult to operate, came to Jinan to lie low. His younger brother, Wang Huideng, is currently a martial arts instructor at the Provincial National Martial Arts Institute. Wang Ziming relied on his brother and lived at No. 147 Jushan Street, near the Jinde Association. Liu Yaoting, the captain of the special service team, sent detective He Zhenshan to track and investigate. After confirming the information, at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 24th), he led a team of officers, three female police officers from the Public Security Bureau, and officers from the local Public Security Sub-bureau to surround and arrest Wang at the address. Wang Ziming, his younger brother Wang Huideng, his mother Wang Yuan, his sister Wang Huilan, his wife Wang Li, his young daughter Xiao Ni, Wang Huideng's wife Wang Dai, his young son Wang Jiafu, Wang’s servant Wang Dezhen, and the landlord Qiao Cai were all taken into custody. 5,800 yuan in cash and several thousand yuan worth of gold and jade jewelry were found hidden in the women's trousers. They were all taken to the military law office. This morning (the 25th), Shi Jingzhou, the director of the military law office, interrogated them at the military law office. According to Wang Ziming's confession, he is 38 years old, from Fuliu Village, 50 li north of Zhucheng. There are three brothers. My brother Wang Youdeng is dead. My third brother, Wang Huideng, is now in custody. Wang Li is my woman, and I have a boy and my younger siblings. I was first kidnapped to be a bandit. Afterwards, I sought to turn in my guns to avoid death but could not. I had no choice but to continue until now. I have been a bandit for seven or eight years. There are still more than 200 men under my command, led by Zhou Zhiting, Hu Desheng, and Lin Shigang. I don't know where they are now. In the 19th year [of the Republic, 1930], I was introduced by Ge Zhisheng of Wang Village in Gaomi to surrender to Zhang Buyun (i.e., the Lian Zhuang Association of the 8th District of Gaomi). Ge defrauded me of 22 guns. I have no people, no guns, and no savings in Jinan. If the Chairman employs me, I can gather them and surrender." Wang Huideng confessed that he is 25 years old, graduated from the former Martial Arts Training Institute, and worked as a former staff member for Director Zhang at the National Martial Arts Institute. He is currently a teacher at the National Martial Arts Institute and has not been involved in banditry. (He Zhenshan testified that Wang Huideng did not follow his brother in banditry.) Wang Yuan confessed that she is 65 years old and Wang Ziming is her son from her first marriage. He left home nine years ago. Wang Li confessed that she is 28 years old, from Shilitun north of Yidu, and was forced to marry Wang Ziming more than ten years ago. She has a little girl named Xiao Ni. Wang Dai confessed that she is 30 years old, from Yidu County. Wang Huideng is my husband, and Wang Ziming is my brother. He came here in July. My husband advised him to leave, but he wouldn't listen. My husband went to Nanjing. The money I brought was given to me by my sister-in-law. In addition, the servant Wang Dezhen and the landlord Qiao Cai confessed that they did not know that Wang Ziming was a bandit. After the questioning was completed, Shi Jingzhou, the director of the military law office, reported to Han Fuqu [the governor of Shandong]. Han ordered that Wang, having been captured, should be executed immediately to appease the people. Therefore, at 1:30 PM, a car took Wang Ziming to Luokou in the north of the city to be executed by firing squad. The notorious bandit of many years was brought to justice in one day, and the people were very happy. His younger brother, Wang Huideng, and the rest of his family are still being held. If ordinary people harbor bandits, they should be punished accordingly. Wang Huideng is Wang Ziming's brother, so it is understandable that he did not report him. The investigation is still ongoing. If it is confirmed that Huideng did not follow his brother in banditry, he will be released. The reward of 10,000 yuan will be awarded to He Zhenshan, the lead investigator in this case, and the female police officers of the special service team. As for Liu Yaoting, the captain of the special service team, he is currently in Jiaodong capturing the remaining bandits. Only a few of Wang’s bandit underlings escaped. It is said that there are still twenty or thirty bandits in Pingdu, Shandong, appearing and disappearing from time to time. It is expected that they will all be cleared up soon. (25th)</p>
<h3>Inspection Notes of Gan, Wan, Xiang and E Provinces (By our special correspondent, Ren An)</h3>
<p>The Rural Situation of Susong and Taihu</p>
<p>Taihu Correspondence: Entering Anhui from Huangmei, the first stop is Susong. The two places are only forty li apart, and the rural situations are largely the same. Rent must also be paid in advance. Even for the best land, rent must be paid. Land is relatively concentrated, with several households in the county renting from 5,000 to 10,000 dan. The area is near rivers and lakes and prone to flooding. The China International Famine Relief Commission operates a credit cooperative there, with an annual interest rate of 4%. Members are limited to farmers easily affected by floods, and the purpose seems to be solely to provide relief for floods. The custom of foot binding for women is very prevalent, and there are many who have not yet unbound their feet, especially in the countryside. Although smoking and gambling are ostensibly strictly prohibited, many secretly violate the rules.</p>
<p>The county seat was once occupied by bandits for three weeks, and wealthy households and gentry suffered significant losses. Later, they were driven back by the national army, and both the city and countryside were able to return to normal. Many public officials in local self-government organs have contracted bad habits. They do not distinguish between public and private interests in terms of economics, and they often shirk their responsibilities in public affairs, leading to the successive county magistrates' planned construction projects becoming empty talk on paper. For example, the construction of dikes over the years has involved huge sums of money, but the yearly floods are still unavoidable. The officials in charge are irresponsible, and even corrupt. When villagers occasionally discuss this, they all curse vehemently. The rural economy is extremely depleted. The currency circulating in the market and surrounding villages is mostly paper money issued by merchants. The issuance of this paper money is unrestricted. Any merchant, even restaurants and teahouses, can issue it freely. The post office refuses to accept it, but others are surrounded by the environment and have no choice but to accept it reluctantly. Magistrate Tao wants to rectify the financial situation and wants to ban these paper money, but he cannot realize it because of the financial depression. Money houses cannot use credit for foreign exchanges, but must use cash, and the number of foreign exchanges is increasing more than before, which is also an abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<p>The county's rice production is insufficient in normal years, relying on about 20,000 shi imported from neighboring counties. Miscellaneous grains and wheat are exported, about 80,000 to 100,000 shi, and are sold to Jiujiang, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and other places. Special products include riverside melon seeds, lakeside silver fish, and the tobacco industry, which are all renowned in the world.</p>
<p>Heading north to Taihu County, the Anhui First District Commissioner's Office is located there. It is said that the Commissioner has not been in office for long, and he is quite serious about banning smoking. Notices of execution for offenders are posted in the four cities, so there are no people who openly smoke. It seems to be a good scene. However, when he first took office, he brought too many people and could not place them. Just when the smoking ban was strict, he widely appointed them to inspect smoking offenders. But there are unscrupulous elements among them who secretly carry smoking devices for inspection. If they encounter honest and easily deceived families, even if there is no criminal behavior, they will bring out the smoking devices they carry, falsely accuse them as evidence, and extort money. The people suffer greatly from this. Fortunately, the realization came early, and the harm is still shallow.</p>
<p>The county government was once in urgent need of government expenses and issued a kind of "receipt" (meaning bond), divided into one yuan, two yuan, three yuan, and five yuan, which were purchased in advance by grain households with cash, and could be used for grain payment in the autumn. When the autumn levy began, the county government used cash shortage as an excuse, and issued a notice to the levy office that "receipts" for grain payment would only be accepted for half, and the remaining half would still be collected in cash. Grain households had no choice but to comply. However, the "receipts" they held were all in whole amounts and could not be exchanged for change. When they asked the levy office for change, they were told that the county government had no cash and refused to give any. Fearing that they would be fined for exceeding the deadline, they prepared the full amount of cash and paid on time. Unexpectedly, rumors suddenly spread that the "receipts" would soon expire. At the same time, merchants willing to buy "receipts" at a discount emerged. Most of the grain households holding "receipts" were ignorant villagers, who were troubled by the uselessness of the "receipts". Suddenly hearing the news that they could be sold, they all rushed to sell them at lower prices, not even caring about the huge losses they suffered. However, these merchants dared to buy these "receipts" so suddenly, and there was naturally something special about it.</p>
<p>Very few farmers in various villages are self-cultivating, and most are tenant farmers. The tenant farming methods are: one is to pay a deposit (i.e., rent deposit), called "Baozhuang"; the other is not to pay, called "Qingzhuang". The amount of the deposit is not fixed, generally 20 to 30 yuan per shi of land. The right to sublet exists in Baozhuang, but not in Qingzhuang. The amount of rent paid is mostly determined temporarily. The usual ratio between the landlord and tenant is four to six for Baozhuang, and six to four for Qingzhuang. If a tenant wants to leave, if it is Qingzhuang, they can do so casually. If it is Baozhuang, the landlord must first propose it, and there must be a special reason to return the entire deposit and obtain the tenant's consent before it can be done. Otherwise, if the tenant has no arrears, they have the right to continue farming. In places that were disturbed by the communists a few years ago, the rent amount has been appropriately reduced. Even the old "three-tenths rent", which was even heavier than "landlord six, tenant four", is now reduced to "eighteen percent deduction" or even "fifteen percent deduction" (the so-called three-tenths rent means that if the harvest is three shi, the landlord gets two shi and the tenant gets one shi. The so-called fifteen percent deduction or eighteen percent deduction means that the two shi is reduced to one shi and five dou or one shi and eight dou, which are all local terms). Five years ago, the price of one mu of land was 80 yuan for the best, and 40 yuan for the second. Now the best has fallen to 40 yuan, and the medium and low have also fallen by half. The wages of hired laborers are about 30 to 40 yuan per year, which is roughly the same as in other places, but in this place, clothes, shoes, hats, and tobacco money are provided, which seems to be better than in other places. All other spiritual treatments are more progressive than before. It is said that these phenomena all occurred after the communist disturbances.</p>
<p>The annual production of rice can generally be self-sufficient. Usually, because the wheat produced is mostly transported to Shipai, Anqing, and other places, the rice from Qianjiang and Jiangxi can be transported in to supplement it, about 200,000 to 300,000 shi per year. There are also poria cocos, lacquer, hide oil, chestnuts, silver fish, tea, persimmons, and pears, etc., with an annual output value of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Also, coming here from Susong, the white mountains are rugged, all of which are limestone. Limestone is produced nearby, especially in Xueshan'ao.</p>
<p>The counties of Huoshan, Luan, and Lihuang to the north are all destinations to be inspected. However, going directly to Huoshan from here is 380 li, passing through the mountains of Wanshan (i.e., Tianzhu Mountain) and the Fenjieling Mountains. There are still small groups of communist Red Guards who appear from time to time. If they encounter public officials or wealthy merchants, their heads will not be safe. Moreover, remote villagers secretly hide firearms. Whenever they see passersby, if there is an opportunity, they will also transform into bandits and loot their silver and goods. However, they do not let go of the poor and do not tie up the rich, which is different from the Red Army. Therefore, the traffic on this road has long been cut off invisibly, so the route has been changed. It is planned to take a boat from Xujiadu, cross the lake, arrive at Anqing, transfer to a car and pass through Tongcheng and other counties, and go to Luan.</p>
<h3>Huangpu Port Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Planned to be constructed in four phases, step by step</p>
<p>To be completed within fifty years</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The plan for the construction of Huangpu Port in Guangdong has been advocated for a long time, but it has not been implemented due to financial constraints. However, the port development plan has been designed and surveyed by Chinese and foreign engineers sent by the Guangdong River Management Committee for several times. Recently, the River Management Committee has brought up the old topic again and sent technician Li to prepare a Huangpu Port construction plan, which was submitted to the Standing Committee of the River Management Committee and submitted to the Southwest Political Affairs Conference for review. According to the construction procedures planned this time, it is divided into four phases and implemented in phases. The first phase is to establish the prototype of Huangpu Port, which is planned to be completed in five years. The second phase is to develop Huangpu Port into a third-class port and a commercial port, which is planned to be completed in ten years. The third phase is to develop Huangpu into a second-class port and a small city, which is planned to be completed in fifteen years. The fourth phase is to complete Huangpu as a first-class port and a large city, which is planned to be completed in twenty years. The first phase of the project is planned to build a steel bridge pile embankment of 4,200 feet from the east of Yuzhu Market to the south of Yuchun Fort in front of Xieshan, Zhugang Village, Yuzhu Fort, and Niutouzui, and build six warehouses to form the prototype of a commercial port. The second phase of the project is to maintain the current import waterway of Huangpu, with a depth of 20 feet below the low water level of the spring tide. Ships with a draft of 18 feet can sail at any time, and those with a draft of 23 feet to 25.25 feet can enter when the tide rises. Build shops, set up markets, and open port industrial areas in the port for trade and transportation. The third phase is to develop Huangpu Port into a world-class second-class port and a small city, and deepen the depth of the import waterway to 27 feet below the low water level of the spring tide (excavate approximately 7,924,000 cubic meters of mud) so that ships with a draft of 28 feet to 35.25 feet can enter when the tide rises. Develop port industrial areas, residential areas, small commercial areas, large commercial areas, light industrial areas, heavy industrial areas, and port city administrative areas in the port, and build railways to connect with the Yuehan Railway, and build embankments, warehouses, wharves, and shipyards to form a complete port city.

<h3>Henan Provincial Government Resolves to Relocate Disaster Victims from Hua County</h3>
<p>First, relocate 25,000 people</p>
<p>To various counties along the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: This summer, the Yellow River breached at Changyuan, and Hua County in northern Henan suffered extremely heavy damage. Now it is the severe winter season, and the water surface is still more than thirty li wide, and its momentum has become a torrent. Recently, it has continued to rise more than three feet, and the huge waves are monstrous, which is even worse than before. Disaster victims in the disaster area, risking danger in boats, go to the shelters in the cities and towns to avoid freezing and starvation. Boats sink, and several occur every day. In mid-November, when Liu Zhi inspected the county, he believed that the Yellow River would not change its course from there, and after the water receded, it would all become sand dunes, and it would be impossible to cultivate. Therefore, he had the idea of ​​moving the disaster victims to the special zone in southern Henan, so that the desolate land that had been repeatedly destroyed by the Red Army would gradually prosper. He also telegraphed the Secretariat of the Provincial Government to convene a meeting of various departments to formulate an implementation plan. It was then drafted by the Henan Relief Committee and submitted to the Provincial Government for review. The Provincial Government ordered the departments of civil affairs, finance, and education to review the original plan and submit it. It advocated first immigrating 50,000 people, but the special zone was almost completely destroyed. If they were moved there, housing, farm tools, cattle, and horses would all need to be prepared, and it would be useless without millions of yuan. It is not easy to raise funds in the provincial treasury. Therefore, the Provincial Government decided at its 309th meeting yesterday to first move 20,000 people to the counties along the Pinghan Railway between Zhangde and Yancheng. During the relocation period, each person will be issued a living allowance of one jiao per day, and children will be issued five fen. The funds will be raised by the Finance Department. After arriving at the designated location, the local government will be responsible for raising everything and finding ways to resettle them.

<h3>Extension of Loaned Grain Repayment for One Year</h3>
<p>Previously, this province, due to the provincial treasury's deficit and insufficient income, borrowed grain from the people with the approval of the Finance Department to meet the needs of the province. It was originally scheduled to be repaid the following year, but the number of harvests has been weak for years, and only borrowing has not been repaid. Various counties have repeatedly requested repayment on record. It is heard that the Finance Department initially planned to start this year to repay the funds borrowed since the 18th year in five years, repaying 9 jiao each year and repaying it in full in five years. However, the Finance Department stated that the amount to be repaid each year would be more than 1.2 million, and admitted that since the flood and the Shanghai war, the provincial treasury's income has not been able to cover its expenditures, resulting in the original repayment plan ultimately becoming a mere formality. Therefore, a notice was issued to various counties to inform them that all repayments of borrowed grain will be extended for one year.</p>

They first robbed Lu Pei'guan's house next door, but did not get what they wanted, so they broke into Lu Songting's house and searched at will, and beat Lu Yu and Jin Bao, forcing them to tell where the silver was hidden. At that time, Lu Zhou woke up from her dream and knew that something was wrong, so she escaped from the back door. Unexpectedly, she was spotted by the robbers, and two robbers tracked her down. Zhou was panic-stricken and accidentally fell into the river. The remaining robbers searched Lu's house for about two hours before fleeing with the stolen goods. The total loss was more than 200 yuan. Afterwards, Lu Songting went out to look for his wife and found her dead body in the river. He immediately hired workers to pick her up and prepare her coffin.

<h3>Difficult to Stop Collecting Fishery Construction Fees</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously received a report from the Jiangdu County Government on behalf of fishery industry representatives Li Hanchuan and others, requesting the cessation of the collection of fishery construction fees. It specially ordered the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Improvement Committee to review it. Now, the committee believes that the construction fees were handled in accordance with the decision of the Central Political Conference. The request to stop the collection is inconsistent with the original arrangement and is afraid that a corner will affect the overall situation. A special letter has been sent to the Provincial Government, stating the reasons and requesting that it be forwarded for compliance. Yesterday (25th), County Magistrate Ma of Jiangdu informed the original submitter of the situation of inconvenience to comply and asked them to comply.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Ban Performances in the Name of Charity</h3>
<p>Every winter, many kind-hearted people in Yangzhou have many different charity projects. Last year, someone initiated fundraising by performing plays to help the poor, but as a result, very few poor people benefited. It is heard that someone is initiating fundraising by performing plays again, with the titles of social celebrities listed. Letters were sent to salt merchants and wealthy people to sell play tickets, and the Public Security Direct Sub-Bureau sent police to coerce hotels, singers, and other places to recognize and sell the tickets. This has caused a lot of complaints from the outside world. It is now heard that the party and government organs will strictly ban the fundraising method of performing plays in the name of charity in accordance with the provincial order.</p>
<h3>This Year's Xiang An River Transportation Ends</h3>
<p>Xiang An has always been a salt delivery point for Huainan, with 120 tickets stipulated for river transportation each year to supplement the insufficiency of sailing transportation. Since Commissioner Miao advocated river transportation last year, the number of river transportation tickets for the An River has been gradually increased year by year. It is estimated that of the 168 tickets to be handled this year, about 140 tickets are allocated to Jinan. They have all been transported by the end of last month, starting from the eighth month. It is heard that the color of the salt inspected in Xiang is white and clean, and the quality is also dry, which is quite welcome by Xiang. Most of the area is made up of old piles accumulated over the years, and recently, the salt production work has been further improved, striving for excellence.</p>

<h3>Western Corps Camp Repeatedly Injured People</h3>
<p>Li Hengfeng in Xituan Camp, Sixth District of the county, is a well-off family and has long been coveted by bandits. Unexpectedly, seven or eight robbers with guns suddenly came last night. The family woke up from their dreams and could not escape. Hengfeng was tied by bandits and hung on the beam, and burned under his armpits with fire to force him to tell where the silver was hidden. Hengfeng could not bear the pain and pointed out where the silver was hidden. The bandits saw that their goal had been achieved, so they searched extensively and looted 190 yuan in cash, as well as clothing and sundries. The loss was quite large. They then went to six neighboring houses and looted them all. Later, the army and police stationed in Nan Gan Tuo learned of this and immediately fired shots to chase after them. The bandits fled away. It is heard that Hengfeng was seriously injured and may be in danger of his life.</p>

<h3>District Farmers' Association Opposes Rent Payment Standard</h3>
<p>The county government convened all the county's organizations and groups to discuss and determine the early and late rice rent payment standards. However, the County Farmers' Association and its affiliated district farmers' associations successively filed petitions, stating that the rent payment standards set by the county government and others violated the principle of 25% rent reduction, increased the burden on tenant farmers, and requested the cancellation of the rent payment standards agreed this time. The board rent must be reduced by 25% according to the amount, and the flower rent must be converted at 37.5%. The County Farmers' Association has submitted an application to the provincial government and has obtained permission from the provincial party headquarters, ordering the county party headquarters to investigate and handle it. At the same time, the Xiaoshan County Party Headquarters also has a request to ban landlords from collecting rent by citing the false rent amount on the lease, and the actual rent amount before the 16th year must be followed to comply with the original meaning of the 25% rent reduction. The County Party Headquarters of this county has issued a notice to all tenants in the county to comply with this dispute.</p>

<h3>County Government Mediates Dispute in Slaughterhouse Industry</h3>
<p>Since the Hefei City Butchers' Association implemented public slaughter and distributed the meat to each butcher for sale, each yuan is stipulated to be five jin, and no more is allowed. However, in the rural slaughter industry, each yuan sells six or seven jin. As a result, the city's meat industry sends people to the countryside every day to buy meat and bring it into the city. The city's butchers are afraid that if this trend continues, they will have no business to do, so they send people to wait at each city gate. If they see meat entering the city, they will detain it, causing a great outcry from the meat industry, who unanimously resisted, saying that they would absolutely not be restricted from spending money to buy things. They filed a complaint with the court. Although there were two court hearings, there was still no thorough solution. The meat industry scattered leaflets on the 20th and decided to suspend business to resist to the death. County Magistrate Guo specially ordered four compromise measures to expand the trend: (1) All slaughtered pigs and sheep, whether they have been registered and licensed, or have a tax stamp affixed to the meat, are allowed to be freely bought and sold within the county, regardless of urban or rural areas. (2) The slaughter tax certificate should be kept by the slaughterer. (3) This government will formulate a tax stamp style and order each tax collector to make and distribute it to each market, and all will be stamped with purple on the inside. (4) Residents who buy three jin or less are exempt from inspection, and those who buy more than three jin must have a tax stamp on the meat.</p>

<h3>Visitors from Fujian Talk About the Central Aircraft Bombardment Situation</h3>
<p>The Min Yan News Agency reports that the Yih Ho Company's Hopsang Steamer arrived in Shanghai from Fujian yesterday. According to refugees fleeing to Shanghai, central government aircraft have been bombing Fujian for days. Beforehand, leaflets were distributed, instructing residents in the northeastern areas to evacuate early to avoid being affected. Furthermore, foreign consulates were requested to order foreigners to leave Fujian. Currently, consulates of various countries stationed in Fujian are preparing to relocate their offices to Chuan Shi. Foreigners are evacuating to Shanghai and Xiamen. On the 24th, the Wang Zhuang airfield, after being bombed by central aircraft, had one reconnaissance plane destroyed. The remaining planes were all moved to nearby farmland, covered with gray cloth to avoid being targeted.</p>
<h3>Naval Department Decides to Send Chen to Lead Warships to Fujian</h3>
<p>Departing from Shanghai Immediately Upon Receipt of Orders</p>
<p>Chen Says Recovery of Mawei Already Confirmed</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the central government's suppression of the rebellion in Fujian Province, the central military authorities have been making preparations separately, aiming to eliminate the rebels in one fell swoop. The naval forces are also actively proceeding. Li Shijia, Vice Minister of the Navy, recently came to Shanghai on behalf of Minister Chen, to meet with Chen Jiliang, Commander of the First Fleet, to discuss the blockade of Fujian's seaports. A Central News Agency reporter went to the First Fleet Headquarters of the Naval Department to inquire with Chen Jiliang. According to Chen's written response, the following is stated:</p>
<p>Date of Departure to Fujian Awaits Orders from the Department: The Naval Department has decided to specially dispatch Chen Jiliang, Commander of the First Fleet, to lead warships from Shanghai to Fujian, to unite the command of the warships currently stationed in Fujian to blockade the Fujian seacoast. However, the date of departure cannot be determined because orders from the department have not yet been received.</p>
<p>Recovery of Mawei Has Already Been Confirmed: After the Mawei Fortress was seized by the Fujian side, Commander Li Mengbin evacuated to Sandu Ao and actively planned its recovery. According to Chen, the recovery of the Mawei Fortress has already been confirmed, and it is understood that there are already nine warships stationed in Fujian.</p>
<h3>People of Fujian Flock to Shanghai and Hong Kong, Foreign Shipping Line Business Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Ticket Prices Have Doubled Compared to Normal</p>
<p>According to the Da Bai News Agency, sources in the transportation industry report that Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, and other places in Fujian Province have recently been subjected to reconnaissance by central government aircraft, causing market chaos and widespread panic. In recent days, relatively wealthy residents of Fuzhou have been moving to Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Fujian pseudo-authorities originally had extremely strict restrictions on incoming and outgoing passengers, but recently, due to the tense situation, they have no time to attend to it. Residents' evacuation seems to be more convenient than before. Therefore, foreign shipping lines operating between Fujian and Hong Kong, and Fujian and Shanghai, have been overcrowded with passengers on every trip, causing the shipping lines to take advantage of the situation and raise ticket prices. Ordinary cabin tickets and large cabin tickets from Fujian to Shanghai have doubled or more, so each shipping line is profiting tenfold.</p>

<h3>Ma Chaojun Returned to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sun Ke May Arrive in Hong Kong the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>Zhang Ji, Wang Luyi, Chen Zhaoying, and Ma Chaojun, the four officials specially dispatched south by the central government, returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong some days ago. Except for Zhang, Wang, and Chen, who had already proceeded to Nanjing, Ma also took the night train back to Nanjing last night at 11:00 PM and is scheduled to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting this morning to report on the results of the trip south. As for the eight proposals for resolving the current situation disputes put forward by Hu Zhantang, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, will visit Hu again when he transfers to Hong Kong from Fiji, for further discussions, so as to formulate a proposal and submit it to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for discussion. Sun is scheduled to leave Fiji yesterday on the President Hoover of the Dollar Steamship Company and should arrive in Hong Kong the day after tomorrow. He must meet with Hu before returning to Shanghai. The rumor that Hu and Sun will go to Nanjing together is premature. Hu must wait until the eight proposals for resolving the current situation disputes are passed before going to Nanjing. Therefore, it is estimated that Hu's arrival in Nanjing will be at the earliest after the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee.</p>

<h3>Collision of the Wanshang and the Lü'an Leads to a Tragic Incident: An Arbitration Tribunal is Organized</h3>
<p>Number of Deaths Said to Be Over One Hundred</p>
<p>Letter Invites China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Send Personnel</p>
<p>The matter of the Wanshang Steamer of the Sanbei Company colliding with the Lü'an Steamer in Qizhou, drowning a large number of recruits, has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Because this case is important, Wanshang claims that Lü'an was at fault, but the Lü'an crew denies it. In order to determine which is right and wrong, it has been decided to proceed with arbitration. Further follow-up details will be recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Hankou Navigation Bureau Handles the Aftermath: According to subsequent investigations, the number of newly recruited soldiers who drowned on the spot in the collision of the Wanshang Steamer and the Lü'an soldier transport Steamer was not only more than sixty, and the total number of newly recruited soldiers killed is said to be over one hundred, so the state of the tragic incident is of greater magnitude. After Wanshang arrived in Hankou, Sanbei assumed full responsibility for the entire case after investigating the facts, so the ship continued to operate as usual, and the case was transferred to the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau for handling, in order to demonstrate fairness.</p>
<p>Interrogation of Pilots of Both Ships: Regarding the issue of responsibility for the collision, according to Weng Jiqing, the acting captain of Wanshang, when meeting Lü'an, they blew one horn, and Lü'an also blew one horn. When Wanshang stopped to give way, Lü'an suddenly blew two horns, causing panic and leading to the disaster. It seems that the responsibility lies with the pilot of Lü'an. Later, it was reported that the pilot of Lü'an had fled. Now, the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau has formally notified both parties, ordering Weng Jiqing, the acting captain of Sanbei's Wanshang, and the two pilots on duty at the time, and also summoning Pan Yixiang, the pilot of Lü'an, to appear in court to prepare for a confrontation to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Organization of a Tribunal for the Tragic Incident: Regarding the tragic incident of the collision of Lü'an, because the matter is serious and the number of deaths is too high, military and political authorities advocate strict investigation of those responsible. In order to handle this case carefully and ensure the accuracy of the facts, the Dian Navigation Administration Bureau has specially organized a tribunal for the tragic incident of the sinking of the Lü'an, dispatching personnel from the Navigation Administration Bureau to conduct on-site investigations and employing impartial navigators to take on the arbitration task.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Designates a Committee Member: The arbitration committee members have been drafted by the Navigation Administration Bureau, and Sanbei and Lü'an have each hired one person to serve as an impartial person for this case. Sanbei Company initially planned to send Zheng Dingxi, owner of the Changxing Ship, as an impartial member. However, due to company relations, he recused himself according to regulations. Yu Qiaqing sent a letter to Liu Hongsheng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting that Wang Youshi, owner of the Jianguo Steamer, be appointed as an arbitrator. Once the Lü'an side is hired, the court will be immediately opened to conduct investigations and interrogations to arbitrate the responsibility for this tragic incident. Whichever party is proven to be at fault will bear full responsibility for the solution.</p>
<h3>Jin Xi's Family Representatives Refute Replies from French and Japanese Consulates</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Chen Yang and Li Shichang, representatives of Jin Xi's family, have been contacting Korean expatriates in various places and joining forces to protest since Jin Xi was arrested. Recently, Chen and lawyers Lou and Xu went to the Municipal Government again. They were shocked to hear the official replies from the French and Japanese consulates and immediately argued based on reason. According to Chen, the French consulate replied to the Municipal Government, saying that Jin Xi admitted to being Korean in the French Concession police station and that they did not know he had been naturalized as Chinese at the time, so they directly handed him over to the Japanese consulate for detention. From this point of view, the French consulate clearly knew that if Jin Xi had been naturalized as Chinese, they should not have colluded with the Japanese consulate in an illegal arrest. Therefore, setting aside the legal aspect for the time being, it is only necessary to prove that Jin Xi had indeed been naturalized as Chinese, and that the French consulate knew about it beforehand. Furthermore, considering that Jin Xi accompanied his father in naturalizing as Chinese, the original purpose was for the protection of Chinese politics. Moreover, at the time of the illegal arrest by the Japanese consulate, why would he admit to being Korean and give the Japanese consulate an excuse? From a human perspective, even a fool would not do this. Furthermore, there are no records in the police station, so how can they rely on empty words? Moreover, Jin and his father suffered a tragedy last November, and the entire process was covered extensively in Chinese and foreign newspapers. Even Chinese and French agencies have files to consult. In addition, Jin Xi lived on Malang Road in the French Concession for five or six years. How can the French consulate claim that they did not know he had been naturalized as Chinese beforehand? These facts based on reason and evidence are sufficient to prove that the French consulate has a responsibility to demand his return and cannot arbitrarily shirk its responsibility. As for the Japanese consulate's reply to the Municipal Government, stating that Japan has not recognized Jin Xi's transfer to Chinese citizenship and that Jin Xi is not the eldest son of Jin Yongduo, etc., these are even more far-fetched and unreasonable arguments. It is important to know that Jin Xi was naturalized as Chinese along with his father Jin Yongduo. If his father's naturalization as Chinese has been recognized by Japan, then there is no question about Jin Xi's naturalization as Chinese citizenship. It is recalled that last November, when Jin and his father were illegally arrested, the Chinese and French authorities lodged a serious protest based on their naturalized citizenship, and Jin Yongduo was subsequently sent back by the Japanese consulate. This is sufficient to prove that the Japanese consulate had long recognized that Jin and his father had been naturalized as Chinese. Why are they now denying it so strongly? Furthermore, the point that Jin Xi is not the eldest son of Jin Yongduo is even less worthy of mention. Whether he is a nephew or an adopted son, free admission is permitted under Chinese law. As long as there is a naturalization permit, Jin Xi is the eldest son of Jin Yongduo, and there is no doubt that he is a Chinese citizen. Moreover, Japan recognizes Koreans transferring to Chinese citizenship. How can they despise China and uniquely deny it? Some say that the reason why Jin and his father were sent back last year was that the Japanese consul overstepped the French Concession's police power and exchanged them. This is illogical and not worth a smile. In short, based on public reason, the final victory in this case will ultimately belong to us. Civilized countries will definitely express sympathy and assistance and make a judgment based on right and wrong. It is said that weak countries have no diplomacy, which is a nationwide concern. However, if we do not fight for this, international powers will look down on us as a dying nation, and the future of diplomacy will be even more difficult to imagine. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Issues an Order Stipulating Commemoration Methods for New Year's Day</h3>

<p>The methods for commemorating the 23rd year of the Republic of China on New Year's Day have been ordered by the Executive Yuan for compliance. All agencies will cease operations, and factories will cease work to celebrate. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Order: The Executive Yuan orders that:</p>
<p>According to the order of the National Government, the Central Government has decided on the methods for commemorating the 23rd year of the Republic of China on New Year's Day. On this day, all circles across the country will hang flags to celebrate. Party, government, military, and various other agencies, groups, and schools in various places will hold celebrations separately. However, during this national crisis, there is no need for excessive extravagance. In accordance with previous practice, there will still be a three-day holiday from New Year's Day to celebrate. In addition to separate dispatches, this telegraphic order is urgently issued for compliance and to instruct subordinates to comply.</p>
<p>Celebrations in All Circles: On New Year's Day next year, all agencies will uniformly cease operations for three days as usual, schools will have holidays, and factories will cease work for one day in accordance with the Factory Law, with wages paid as usual. Factories with existing customs will still follow the usual practice. All shops and companies will be closed for the holidays. All circles will hang flags to celebrate.

<h3>Various Parties Urge China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Open the Beijing-Hankou Express Passenger Service Early</h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's plan to open the Beijing-Hankou express passenger service was proposed last year. Subsequently, the Hubei Construction Department and the Navigation Administration Bureau put forward specific methods. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has accepted the proposal, and the Shipping Department is planning everything. This matter has been reported in this newspaper before. Now, the Hubei Construction Department has negotiated with various railway bureaus, and they have all expressed their sympathy and cooperation, urging the early opening of the service. This matter is of great importance to the Yangtze River traffic, and the details will be recorded further below.</p>
<p>Twenty-Two Hour Voyage: The Beijing-Hankou express passenger service stipulates that it will only stop at Jiujiang port. From Hankou to Beijing, the downstream voyage will only take twenty-two hours. Reaching the capital from Hankou will shorten the voyage to less than a day. The speed is unparalleled. Once it opens, it will definitely be welcomed by passengers, and passengers who usually take foreign shipping line steamers will definitely switch to this express passenger service. Therefore, business development can be assured. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally planned to use the Emei Steamer for the first trial voyage, but unfortunately, the ship suddenly hit a reef in Huatanzi, resulting in no ship being dispatched for the time being.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Has Expressed Sympathy: In order to realize this Yangtze River express passenger service as soon as possible, the Hubei Construction Department has contacted the Hunan-Hubei Railway, the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and the Nanwan Railway separately to handle the connection and transshipment of passengers by land and water between the railways and the express river steamer, and to issue joint train and boat tickets, etc. All the railways believe that this is a measure to develop traffic and facilitate passengers, and they have unanimously agreed and promised to provide assistance. The Hubei Construction Department has also sent a letter to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting the prompt opening of the service.</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Agrees to Assist: The start and end of the Yangtze River express passenger service are most closely connected to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and the relationship is also the greatest. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway authorities have replied to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ministry of Communications, stating that the Railway Bureau will do its best to support the opening of the express passenger service in order to achieve cooperation. Special conveniences can also be provided for land and water travel connections.</p>
<p>Minister Zhu's Urging: Minister of Communications Zhu Jiajuahai, upon receiving letters and telegrams from all parties urging the early opening of the Yangtze River express passenger service, has instructed Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to plan and open the river steamer as soon as possible in order to meet the expectations of all parties and gradually recover the navigation rights that have been lost on the Yangtze River. After receiving the letter from Minister Zhu, Liu has handed it over to the Shipping Department and the Business Department to jointly prepare and find a way to dispatch river steamers in order to open the service for operation as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The National Products Movement Held a Drawing Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Opening is Scheduled for the 30th of This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Zone National Products Movement Congress, sponsored by the China National Product Manufacturers Association, convened a representative meeting of participating manufacturers at the association's venue at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road at 2:00 PM yesterday and drew lots to determine the locations.

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Opens Southwest Route, Test Flight Today</h3>
<p>Huang Baoxian, Nie Kaiyi, and Others Depart for Hankou Yesterday</p>
<p>From Hankou to Chongqing, Passing Through Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan</p>
<p>If Successful, Border Regions Will No Longer Be Isolated</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation, after completing the three major trunk lines of Shanghai-Beiping, Shanghai-Chongqing, and Shanghai-Guangdong, is planning to open a southwest route from Hankou, passing through Changsha (Hunan), Guangzhou, Longzhou (Guangxi), Kunming, and reaching Chongqing. A test flight is scheduled for today, departing from Hankou. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departed for Hankou Yesterday At 9:30 AM yesterday, the aircraft for the southwest route test flight departed from Longhua Airport, piloted by the company's chief pilot, Anlixun. Accompanying him were Wang Baoxian, director of the business department, and Nie Kaiyi, Chinese director of the aviation department. They arrived safely in Hankou at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Flying to Guangzhou This Morning The aircraft is scheduled to take off from Hankou this morning, passing through Changsha in Hunan and reaching Guangzhou for an overnight stay. If the weather is good, it will depart tomorrow for Longzhou in Guangxi, with a short stop planned, and then continue west to Kunming in Yunnan, before flying north from Kunming to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Southwest Transportation After the test flight returns, preparations for the official opening of the route will be made based on the situation. The southwestern provinces, such as Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, have mountainous terrain and inconvenient transportation. Travel and mail often take more than a month to arrive. Kunming, Longzhou, and other places even find it easier to take a detour through French Indochina. The inconvenience is evident. If this route is successful, the southwestern border regions will no longer be isolated from the Central Plains.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Sends Telegram Requesting Collection of Stamp Tax from Foreign Nationals</h3>
<p>Stamp Tax is Also a National Tax</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals Cannot Be an Exception</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that foreign merchants in Shanghai have not been complying with the commercial treaty by affixing stamp tax. They urgently request that the central authorities promptly collect the tax to uphold the dignity of central laws and regulations. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, requesting the collection of stamp tax from foreign nationals. The original text is as follows: (Titles omitted) "The stamp tax is a central tax, the same as customs and salt taxes, and is not local in nature. In the past, warlords in the Shanghai Special District repeatedly tried to implement the stamp tax, but only required Chinese people to affix it, which was opposed by various business associations and failed. After our National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the association was the first to support and assist in its promotion. All of this is on record. We deeply believe that foreign nationals should be no exception to the national stamp tax, which is the same as customs and salt taxes. Unexpectedly, inspections are now meticulous, and the severe penalties for failing to affix stamps can lead to bankruptcy for merchants, which is not only harmful to the country and the people but also puts the cart before the horse. The provisions of the commercial treaty have become mere formalities, and the dignity of central laws and regulations is lost. Therefore, we specially send this telegram requesting that you promptly remedy the situation, hoping that everyone will share the burden equally and that both persuasion and punishment will be used. In maintaining tax revenue, we will not lose sight of the difficulties faced by merchants. We specially send this telegram for your consideration and implementation. Central tax revenue relies on it." Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation.</p>

The directors then conducted a detailed discussion and study. The results will be released in a day or two after being整理. The next board meeting is scheduled for January 9 next year. It is reported that the next meeting between Feixindun and Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government will be held at the beginning of next year.</p>
<h3>Fan Xudong Plans to Establish Ammonium Sulfate Plant</h3>
<p>Banking Sector Has Agreed to Loan</p>
<p>The Authorities Also Commend and Assist</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, recognizing that ammonium sulfate is not only a large-scale agricultural fertilizer but also has great uses in national defense, but is entirely purchased from abroad at a great cost each year, decided two years ago to establish an ammonium sulfate plant and sent experts to the UK and Germany to negotiate joint ventures. However, due to the other party's harsh conditions, it was not achieved. Local industrialist Fan Xudong, aware of this and with the support of Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, and banking magnate Zhang Gongquan, has decided to raise 7 million yuan to establish an ammonium sulfate plant in Shanghai. All preparations are in place, and it will be opened as soon as the plant site issue is resolved. According to a Central News Agency reporter, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Annual Demand Ammonium sulfate is the most suitable and best fertilizer for agriculture. According to recent surveys, China's annual demand for ammonium sulfate reaches 150,000 tons. Because there is no domestic production, all of it is imported from abroad, costing about 30 million yuan per year. It is estimated that after the expansion of farmland in the future, the demand will reach more than 5 million tons. (Japan's farmland is less than one-tenth of China's, but its annual demand for ammonium sulfate reaches more than 600,000 tons.) There is indeed a need to establish a plant for domestic production.</p>
<p>Support from All Parties After the plan for a joint venture between the Ministry of Industry and the UK and Germany was announced to be halted, local industrial expert Fan Xudong began to prepare separately. Fan is the manager of Yongli Alkali Company and has spent more than ten years specializing in the research of pure alkali production methods, which has now been completed. Therefore, the company's annual production of pure alkali can supply 70% of the national consumption, which is currently the best achievement in industry. Fan, lacking capital, made various plans. After several months of running around, he has now obtained the support of Zhang Gongquan, Bei Songsheng, Li Fusun, Chen Guangfu, Xu Xinliu, Zhou Zuomin, and other powerful figures in the local banking sector, who have agreed to loan Fan 7 million yuan under certain conditions as capital for establishing the ammonium sulfate plant. Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, and Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo have also praised his ambition and promised to do their best to assist.</p>
<p>Progress of the Plan Since obtaining the support of all parties, Fan's progress has been very smooth. All internal preparations have been largely resolved, and he is currently working on the plant site issue. It will be opened as soon as the plant site issue is resolved. The location of the plant site has been decided to be in Shanghai. As for the machinery, it is said that negotiations are underway for ordering.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to Find Ways to Use Wheatstone Receiving Machines</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating, "After investigating the interference caused by electrified lines, significant work is needed to avoid it. According to the report from the Tianjin Bureau's business director, 'When interference occurs on the lines, the symbols received by the Wheatstone receiving machine are clearer than those received by the undulator receiving machine. Tianjin-Qingdao and Tianjin-Jinan direct lines have successively switched to using Wheatstone receiving machines.' Your bureaus should immediately follow the example of the Tianjin Bureau and find ways to switch to using Wheatstone receiving machines to avoid interference and install surge arresters to increase the speed. Also, the resistance of the coils of the Wheatstone receiving machines in your bureaus when connected in series and parallel, and the sending and receiving current of each express line, should be thoroughly investigated and reported. Furthermore, the Wheatstone receiving machine requires a larger working current. If the receiving current in your bureaus is too weak, making it difficult to work, you can add a standard relay to ensure smooth communication. Please comply with these instructions and report accordingly."</p>
<h3>Hydrographic Office Announces Lightship Off-Station Signals</h3>
<p>From Dawn on January 1st</p>
<p>Shipping Community Should Pay Special Attention</p>
<p>The Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department has issued an announcement regarding the "off-station" signals of lightships along the coast of the Republic of China and the Yangtze River, so that the shipping community should pay special attention. The original text states, "From dawn on January 1, 1934, all manned lightships currently managed by the Maritime Customs Service will display the following signals when they leave their original positions: Article 1: If a lightship drifts away from its original position due to dragging anchor or breaking of the mooring chain, its beacon and fog signal will be stopped immediately. Article 2: If possible, its topmark will also be removed immediately. Article 3: When a lightship is navigating, its signals should be the same as those used by ordinary ships. If the lightship is using its own engine power, the signals displayed during the day should be applied according to the first item or second item of Article 4.

<h3>Reactions to Rent Increase in Hexing Lane</h3>
<p>Sent Letters to Various Organizations Yesterday Seeking Assistance</p>
<p>All the tenants of Hexing Lane in Paike Road have recently reacted to the rent increase by the landlord Yan Huixiang. Yesterday, they specially appointed representatives Tao Binxin, Wang Tianchang, Wei Jinde, etc., to submit petitions to party and government agencies and various organizations such as the Citizens' Federation, requesting assistance. The original text is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, the landlord of this lane, disregarding the plight of the tenants, wants to increase the rent by a large amount of 30% in the midst of business depression and social unrest. Relying on his power, he initially accused the tenants of owing rent since the January 28th Incident and continued to apply to the court for mediation. Fortunately, the judge was wise and advised that the market was depressed and people's livelihoods were difficult, making it impossible to increase the rent. Mediation failed, so the landlord used his financial power to collude with the tenant representative and secretly reached an agreement to increase the rent by 20%. The entire body of tenants issued a statement in the newspaper, resolutely denying it. (Omission) We are deeply afraid that the landlord will try to oppress us again, so we respectfully report the situation and plead with your association to uphold justice and relieve the people's suffering, forward a letter to the landlord to cancel the rent increase to maintain our livelihoods, and ask you to relieve the suffering of the citizens and seek peace and tranquility in the market. We hope that you will stop the landlord from relying on his power to oppress us. We are infinitely grateful."</p>
<h3>Resolution of Dispute in the Southern Goods Industry</h3>
<p>The Association Notifies All Shops to Comply</p>
<p>The workers in the southern goods industry in this city, in order to demand the maintenance of the original conditions, caused a dispute. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both labor and management to the bureau to mediate and signed two measures, ordering the trade association to notify all shops to comply uniformly and declaring the resolution. After receiving the order, the association specially notified all shops yesterday to comply uniformly. The original text reads: "For the matter of notification, this association and the former Southern Goods Industry Workers' Association signed a labor-management contract of 23 articles, which has been in effect for three years. The shops have been able to fulfill the agreement and have been at peace. However, it has recently been found that a small number of members have violated the agreement and caused disputes. The Southern Goods Industry Workers' Union submitted a petition to the party and government agencies for relief. On December 2, the Social Affairs Bureau summoned both labor and management to the bureau to mediate, and members of the Municipal Party Committee attended. After mediation by the party and government representatives, two items of a settlement record were signed. Furthermore, on December 14, the Social Affairs Bureau issued Instruction No. 18155, instructing us to forward the instruction to all members to abide by the original contract. Having received this, in order to promote labor-management cooperation and avoid disputes, we hereby notify you. We hope that all members will check and comply."</p>
<h3>Great China Workers Resumed Work in Compliance with Orders, Factory Refused, Conflict Occurred</h3>
<p>Seven Workers Arrested and Released Immediately</p>
<p>The Labor Side Petitioned This Morning, Requesting Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The Great China Rubber Factory on Xujiahui Road employs more than 1,600 workers and has a prosperous business. The factory workers recently initiated the organization of a trade union, which was envied by the factory, which used the excuse to dismiss the union organizers. The Municipal Party Committee approved the resumption of work, but the factory refused, causing a conflict. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Course of the Dispute Guo Junchen, Tao Shiying, and nine other workers of the Great China Rubber Factory were dismissed by the factory under the pretext of non-compliance with the insurance policy procedures because they initiated the preparation of a trade union. The labor side submitted a petition to the party and government agencies, requesting assistance. After investigation by the Municipal Party Committee, it was considered that the factory's dismissal of the workers was not justified. The Municipal Party Committee immediately approved both labor and management, limiting the workers to complete the guarantee procedures within ten days and return to work.</p>
<p>Refusal to Resume Work After receiving the approval from the Municipal Party Committee, the workers immediately prepared the guarantee procedures and went to the factory at 8:00 AM yesterday with the approval from the Party Committee to resume work. The factory initially refused to meet with them. It was not until 1:00 PM that the engineer Ye Zhiyun replied to the workers, saying that the factory refused the workers to resume work. The workers handed over the approval from the Party Committee for review, but it was torn up by Yang Bingjun, an employee of the factory, who immediately closed the factory door tightly, causing a reaction from the workers and a major conflict.</p>
<p>Conflict Occurred The workers believed that the factory had torn up the approval from the Party Committee and closed the factory door tightly, showing contempt for the superior and intentionally oppressing them. Therefore, the crowd was angry and a conflict occurred. One of the factory employees had his clothes torn, and both sides suffered minor injuries. The factory, seeing the serious situation, immediately called the Wenlin Road Police Station, falsely claiming robbery. After receiving the report, the police station sent two police cars and more than 20 police officers to suppress the situation, stationing police around the factory gate and entering to arrest seven workers, including Guo Junchen and Tao Shiying, and took them to the Wenlin Road Police Station for interrogation. As a result, it was considered that the matter was a labor-management dispute and not a robbery. The case was declared inadmissible, and the seven arrested were immediately released.</p>
<p>Petition This Morning The labor side believes that the factory violated the orders of the superior, tore up the instructions, and falsely reported a robbery, which is illegal. In addition to hiring a lawyer to file a lawsuit according to law, they also decided to petition the party and government agencies this morning, requesting a thorough investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Municipal Ferry Opens New Route</h3>

The cross-river ferry currently operates routes including: (1) Dongchang Road to Dongmen Road, (2) Qichangzhan to Weissigong Pier, (3) Qingning Temple to Dinghai Bridge, etc. There are about 20,000 passengers per day. All ferries are made of steel hulls, safe and comfortable, fast and unobstructed by wind. The citizens find it convenient. Now it is learned that the Municipal Ferry Management Office, in order to expand the routes and increase the convenience of the citizens, has decided to open a new cross-river route between Youlong Pier in Pudong and Tongren Pier on the Bund of Nanjing Road in Puxi. All construction work on Youlong Pier and the ferries has been completed, and services will start on the 28th of this month, operating daily from 5:00 AM to 8:00 PM, running back and forth every twenty minutes. From 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the morning and evening, the fare is uniformly 5 copper coins per passenger, and at other times, it is uniformly 8 copper coins per passenger. Tickets are purchased in advance at the pier and then boarded the ship. All methods of carrying goods are the same as those of other cross-river routes.</p>
<h3>Chinese Science Society's Biological Research Institute Organizes Collection Group</h3>
<p>Cooperating with the Beiping Jing Sheng Biological Research Institute and the Academia Sinica</p>
<p>The Biological Research Institute of the Chinese Science Society is dedicated to collecting and investigating domestic biological species. Since the fall of the Northeast Provinces and the occupation of the Nine Small Islands, the frontier has been shrinking day by day, and remote areas have become increasingly noticed by foreigners. At the beginning of their entry, they generally used the pretext of academic groups' exploration. The Biological Research Institute of the Society felt this, and thus there was the organization of the Hainan Biological Science Collection Group. However, Qiongzhou Island is far from Hainan, and the journey is long and arduous, costing a lot. The Research Institute of the Society is a private institution, and its finances are tight, making it extremely difficult to cope. Moreover, the matter is of great importance, and it is feared that the strength of one institution is not enough to bear it. Therefore, it has sent a letter to invite the Beiping Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute and the National Central Research Institute's Museum of Natural History in Nanjing to jointly initiate and cooperate.</p>

<h3>Radio Operators' Strike Starts Today</h3>
<p>The 154 staff members of the Traffic Department's Shanghai Wireless Station Headquarters and the International Radio Station have been working diligently for many years. Recently, because the authorities did not show consideration, the salary increase for this year must be approved and cannot exceed one-third, which means that each person can only get a salary increase once every three years, and the amount is only three yuan, which is considered extremely harsh. Therefore, starting this morning, December 28, they will go on strike to prompt the authorities to realize their mistake and hope that the compatriots of the whole country will give them fair assistance.</p>

<h3>White Gold Dragon Drugs Poison Jiangbei</h3>
<p>Recently, the authorities have been very strict in investigating and cracking down on drug manufacturing institutions, so some drug manufacturing companies have secretly moved far away. It is said that a certain Shenzhuang is selling white gold dragon drugs in name. The drugs are actually a different name for red pills. About 9 million pills are sold every month, and each 10,000 pills are worth 100 yuan, which shows the wide sales market and the harm to society. However, because the authorities are banning them, the drugs dare not be manufactured in Shanghai, so they have moved to Tongrutai and other places in Jiangbei, and the sales market has been extended to Jiangbei. However, the raw materials are still prepared in Shanghai. The manufacturer, Zhu, is skilled in manufacturing drugs and his surgery is also high, so the sales market is expanding day by day. It is hoped that the authorities will strictly investigate and crack down on them to avoid trampling on the crowd.</p>

<h3>Concern of Feng Hua Compatriots Association for their Hometown</h3>

<p>The Feng Hua natives of Shanghai Association, in order to request the cessation of the demolition of the Yongfeng Pavilion on the Waihao River of Ningbo and the Qu Tou incident, sent a letter to the Zhejiang Fifth District Administrative Inspector and the Yin County Government for approval.

An investigation reveals that this area is a vital waterway for Feng Hua, and the only means of livelihood for thousands of boat people. If demolished, it would cut off Feng Hua's water transport and the livelihood of the boat people. Moreover, the area is far from the temporary Jiang Bridge and does not obstruct the construction work. Therefore, there is no need for demolition. We hereby send this letter to request your esteemed association to forward it to the Zhejiang Administrative Inspector and the Yin County Government, imploring them to show compassion and stop the demolition in order to maintain the people's livelihood and friendship. Based on this, our association has approved the aforementioned request.

<h3>Flour Mills to Purchase American Wheat, to Pay Eight Thousand Yuan in Deposit Tax Tomorrow</h3>
<p>So that New Goods May Be Unloaded Starting Immediately</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of flour manufacturers in this city requesting exemption from import tax on purchased foreign wheat, officials and merchants are still discussing solutions. However, the American wheat purchased by manufacturers that has already arrived at customs is still held at customs due to the non-payment of import tax. This not only affects sales but also results in a loss of two thousand yuan per day. Moreover, new goods will continue to arrive in Shanghai in the coming days. If a solution is not found, the losses to manufacturers will be even greater. Therefore, manufacturers have contacted customs and will pay a deposit tax of approximately eight thousand yuan tomorrow to unload the new goods, and then request a tax exemption.</p>

However, the railway authorities, due to the congestion of goods and insufficient allocation of vehicles, and the Ministry of Finance having approved half-price accounting for charitable organizations transporting relief goods, have delayed transportation, and they have not yet been delivered.

<h3>Seamen's Union Concessions from Taikoo after Negotiations over Wusong Ship Case</h3>
<p>Seamen Everywhere Indignantly Request Blocking of Ship Passage</p>
<p>Zhengda Comprador Refuses to Register with the Union, Warning Letter Sent</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, after overturning the resolution of the Wusong ship dispute by the Guangdong Seamen's Industrial Union, directly negotiated with Taikoo, and the company has made concessions on conditions such as registering workers. Also, the comprador of the Zhengda ship of Datong Company refused to register with the union, and a unified response has been decided upon. Details are provided below:</p>
<p>Taikoo Agrees to Concessions: Since the Guangdong Seamen's Industrial Union resolved the Wusong ship dispute with Taikoo Company, seamen in various places have expressed dissatisfaction with this resolution, and the workers on the Wusong ship themselves have also joined in the denial. The Seamen's Union then took charge of the negotiations, and after repeated delegations by secretaries Hou Dachun and Sun Liping, the company expressed concessions on measures such as reorganizing seamen, and agreed to revisions. The union must wait until the entire resolution is overturned before proposing appropriate conditions, so a resolution should be possible soon.</p>
<p>Seamen Everywhere Indignant: Seamen in various places, deeming the handling of the Guangdong Seamen's Industrial Union inappropriate, have unanimously requested the Seamen's Union to resolve the Wusong incident, expecting it to not yield and not sell out the seamen. They also expressed their intention to effectively blockade Taikoo ships nationwide. The union, wanting to avoid a split during this period, will adopt this method if no results are achieved. According to Standing Committee member Zhang Jianbai, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the union can cut off the entry and exit of Taikoo ships at all ports nationwide within four days of a split. Guangdong seamen also expressed their approval of the union's actions.</p>
<p>Dealing with Zhengda Comprador: Zhu Zuoting, the comprador of the Tongyang class Zhengda ship of Datong Company, does not allow 150 workers to register with the union. The workers are planning effective countermeasures and are currently brewing a strike. The Shanghai Seamen's Branch has reported this to the union, requesting a cessation. The union is extremely angry at the comprador's illegal obstruction. Since the seamen's registration has been approved and implemented by the central government, it cannot be easily suspended due to the obstruction of one comprador. In addition to offering guidance, two countermeasures have been established: (1) Send a letter to the company for correction and warning. (2) Otherwise, stop the ship from sailing.</p>
<h3>Pilot Management Association to be Established, Navy Appoints Xu Jixiang as Representative</h3>

The establishment of the Pilot Management Committee is deemed necessary as soon as possible. Regarding the representative to be appointed by the Navy, the Ministry has appointed Xu Jixiang, Director of the Naval Affairs Department, as the representative and has consulted the Ministry of Finance for review.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Bandits Are Active Again, Two Kidnappings in 24 Hours</h3>
<p>He Boxian Kidnapped on Xizang Road Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Huang Jinfu Abducted on Dunxin Road the Night Before</p>
<p>He Boxian: He Boxian, a prominent steel businessman, is 27 years old and lives in Donghua Lane, Xizang Road. Due to his busy schedule, he has a Morris sedan, license number 3496 in the concession and 5997 in the municipal government. Yesterday morning at approximately 11 a.m., He was leaving his house for business and was about to step into the car when four men suddenly jumped out from the lane, each holding a handgun. They seized him, and three bandits got into the back seat with him. One bandit was in the front, monitoring He's driver, Shen Baokang, ordering him to drive the car west on Race Course Road. The driver had no choice but to obey. When they reached the vicinity of New Dagu Road, the bandits ordered the car to stop, pushed the driver Shen Baokang out of the car, and the bandit in the front seat drove off quickly to the west. When the driver was pushed out of the car, the bandits threw a short note beside him, instructing Zhu to hand it over to He's father, He Fangfu. At that time, the driver Zhu Baokang was afraid of endangering his master's life, so he did not dare to speak. After the bandits went far, he rushed back home to deliver the letter and report everything. He's father, upon learning of this, hurriedly discussed with his family. The content of the bandit's letter stated that He had been kidnapped and that they were not allowed to report to the police station. They should wait for contact, and He would be released soon. Afterwards, the Old Gate and New Gate police stations were also notified and immediately dispatched detectives to search for him, but he was nowhere to be found. Therefore, the police station notified all police agencies in the city, requesting assistance. However, as of 10 p.m., the car had not been found.</p>
<p>Huang Jinfu: Huang Jinfu, a native of Dongdi, residing at No. 3, Dong Wangjia Lane, Yidingpan Road, in the Chinese area, is nearly sixty years old. He started from scratch through diligence and thrift and is not wealthy. He has two sons. The eldest son, Jin Di, is 26 years old and works at the Donations Office of the British Public Works Bureau. The second son, Jin Fu, also known as Feng Hao, is 20 years old and works as an accountant at the Xinxing Milk Stand at No. 1040, Zhangjiazhai, Daxilu. He is used to leaving early and returning late. The day before yesterday (the 26th) at 5:15 p.m., Huang was walking home because he was very close to his house. Unexpectedly, two bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, each with a handgun, and warned Huang not to make a sound. They forced him into a car parked in front of No. 107, Dunxin Road, and sped off to the west. By the time patrol officers Zhao Kunhe and Xin Haipu from the Daxilu substation of the Second Division of the Sixth District arrived, the bandits were long gone. They immediately reported to Inspector Qiang Yude to investigate the situation. According to his family, Huang was wearing a black-gray self-made cloth overcoat and black velvet shoes when he was kidnapped. There were no threatening letters beforehand, and no letters from the bandits have been received since the kidnapping. The whole family is very anxious.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Youth Devises Clever Plan to Steal Huge Sum of Money</h3>
<p>Scaring Away Apprentices by Pretending to be a Ghost</p>
<p>Eventually Fully Exposed</p>
<p>Yikang Money Shop, located at No. 68, Avenue Edward VII, has been in business for decades. Due to the effective management of the Zhenjiang native Huang Zibin, the manager, the business has grown year by year, making it a well-known money shop in the French Concession. Yao Lizheng, a 28-year-old fellow townsman of the manager, Huang, knew Huang well and often visited. He used to work in a rubber factory in Shanghai, but was recently suspended for misconduct. Being unemployed and having no means of support, and because his expenses in Shanghai were high, he stayed at the Yikang Money Shop, hoping to find a job. The partners of the shop treated Yao with respect because he was the manager's friend. The shop received silver dollars every day, which were packed in boxes and piled up in the parlor and upstairs. A cellar was set up in a small room behind the parlor to store banknotes, covered with wooden boards. At night, the apprentices laid their beds on the cellar cover to guard it, and Yao also slept on a bed next to the cellar. Yao saw the partners open the cellar to take out cash during the day and saw that the cellar was full of large stacks of banknotes. Being unemployed and short of money, he was tempted by greed and had the evil idea of stealing the money. However, he could not find a way to start because the apprentices slept on the cellar at night. After much deliberation, he came up with a clever plan. When the top apprentice was asleep, he would gently tap the apprentice's head with something. When the apprentice woke up screaming and chasing, Yao would pretend to be asleep and not know anything. After several nights, the apprentice, being young and inexperienced, thought it was a ghost and was too scared to sleep on the cellar anymore and slept elsewhere. On the night of the 15th of this month, only Yao slept in the original place. Seeing that the opportunity had come, he seized it that night when all the partners were asleep and it was quiet, and he lifted the wooden cover of the cellar and stole several bundles of banknotes, totaling 7,600 yuan, and hid them on his body. The next morning when the market opened, he sneaked out and deposited the money at the house of his mistress, Yu Xiuying, a fellow townsman, at No. 538, Yongxing Road, Zhabei. He still pretended to be calm and returned to the shop. When the partners opened the cellar to withdraw money, they discovered the theft and were greatly shocked. They reported it to the French police station, which sent detectives to investigate. They questioned all the partners and Yao, but Yao denied it and was very eloquent, so there were no clues. Yao was lucky enough to escape. The detective reported back to the police chief and continued to investigate. Yao thought that the matter was over. To avoid further suspicion, he left the shop and opened Room No. 5 at the Beiyang Hotel at the intersection of Beizhejiang Road and Jielu. The detectives suspected Yao the most, so they sent someone to secretly investigate him. Yao thought he could get away with it and took out some of the banknotes to buy new clothes, such as a gray crepe silk new fur robe, and showed off his wealth, not knowing that he was being followed. Everything he did was learned. The informants reported to the French police detectives Lu Zhulin and Zhang Daorong, who led detectives Liu Jinrong and Wu Jiahui to arrest Yao on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and took him to the police station for questioning. Yao knew that the matter had been exposed and could not be concealed, so he confessed everything. He had spent 1,400 yuan on buying things and paying off debts, and the remaining 6,200 yuan was at his mistress's house. The detective took Yao to the Public Security Bureau of the First Branch of the Fifth District of Zhabei and requested the police to go to No. 538, Yongxing Road to arrest Yao's mistress, Yu Xiuying. 6,200 yuan of the original stolen banknotes were found in a suitcase and taken to the station. After questioning by the station chief, Yu and the stolen goods were ordered to be sent to the main bureau for verification. The detectives brought Yao back to the police station and sent him to the Second Special District Court for questioning yesterday. In the afternoon at 3 p.m., Judge Sun Pengxian sat in the eighth criminal court for trial. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi said that the police station had not yet investigated the case, and the defendant's mistress, who had received the stolen goods, was currently detained in the Public Security Bureau. He requested a postponement, temporarily detaining the defendant, and requested the court to prepare a document to transfer his mistress's case to investigate and prosecute. After reviewing the report, the court briefly questioned Yao Lizheng and then announced a postponement to January 5, 23rd year of the Republic of China, for a retrial. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>The Truth about the Seventh Prize Drawing Method of the Third Aviation Lottery</h3>

<h3>A Murder Case Occurred Late at Night Near Zhaofeng Garden</h3>
<p>Competing for the Position of Foreman of a Wood Factory, Colleagues Killed Each Other</p>
<p>At approximately 11:20 p.m. the night before yesterday, a shooting murder case suddenly occurred near the Sujiajiao small bridgehead next to the Zhaofeng Garden on Avenue Haig. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reason for the Feud: Luo Changfa, a native of Jintan, 30 years old, currently residing at No. 22, Zhongshan Bridge, Husi, served as the foreman of the Jingyi Wood Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, North Beach, on the 16th day of the eighth lunar month of this year. However, the factory's general manager, Qi Yugen, immediately approached Luo and introduced a man from Jiushan, Yuan Yongshi, to cooperate with Luo in the position of foreman. At that time, Luo, under the order of the manager, implemented the cooperation between the two. Since then, the two went to the factory every day to serve, and they felt quite congenial, and there were no conflicts for two months. However, on December 1, after Luo received the work money in the factory, Yuan suddenly led a large number of workers to calculate wages with Luo, deliberately making things difficult for him. They were twisted and sent to the Sixth District Police Station to pay a fine and released. Then Yuan asked Luo to leave his job and let him take the position alone. Luo did not answer, and Yuan did not go to the factory.</p>
<p>Shooting Murder: Three days ago, Yuan had gone to Luo to question him and said that if you were not willing to leave the job, he would use a gun to deal with him. Luo was afraid of misfortune, so he avoided lodging elsewhere. At more than 11 o'clock the night before yesterday, Luo suddenly passed through the youth association lane entrance on Avenue Haig and happened to meet Yuan's younger brother, Yuan Yongtang, who was driven by Yuan to the lane. Not far down the road, he saw Yuan Yongshi and a person named Zhang Shizhi come. Then the three people surrounded Luo and walked. When they arrived at the small bridge, Yuan and Zhang each fired a gun at Luo. Luo was shot and fell to the ground. Yuan and others saw that their goal had been achieved and fled.</p>
<p>Wounded Report: It was late at night, and the place was secluded. After a while, Luo endured the pain and crawled to the entrance of the youth association lane and reported to the No. 2 post police officer of the Sixth District. He was taken back to the district. The district officer found that Luo had been shot twice. One bullet passed through the cotton robe, and one bullet hit his right leg. Blood was flowing. After a brief interrogation, he was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, avoiding a threat to his life. Police were dispatched to investigate and found two bullet casings.</p>
<p>Arrested Murderer: Yesterday, District Chief Tan sent police and detectives to Zhoujiaqiao to arrest the murderers Yuan Yongshi (33 years old, Shandong native) and Yuan Yongtang (31 years old, Shandong native). Only Zhang Shizhi had fled upon hearing the news. They were taken back to the district. After an interrogation by District Officer Xing, he was sentenced and sent to the Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Chance Encounter Reveals Long-Lost Love</h3>
<p>Zhang Bohe Heartlessly Abandons Her, Ignoring Their Past Affection</p>
<p>Fang Aying Can No Longer Tolerate It, Files a Criminal Self-Complaint</p>
<p>Fang Aying, a young woman residing at No. 49, Taian Lane, Tiantong Road, is only twenty-three years old. At the age of fourteen, she was quite developed, so she seemed like an adult, and she understood the ways of the world, so she was seduced by a man named Zhang Bohe and was raped. After her parents learned of this, they questioned Zhang, and Zhang promised to formally marry Aying as his wife when she reached adulthood. In the meantime, he temporarily cohabited with her. Aying's parents, because the matter was already done, did not want to make excessive demands, and the matter was settled. Two years later, Aying gave birth to a son, who is now seven years old. But when Aying was eighteen years old, Zhang, fearing that he would have to fulfill his marriage promise, claimed to be going to Japan for trade and asked Aying to take good care of their son. Before leaving, he gave her three hundred gold coins for household expenses. Aying did not understand this kind of excuse for traveling far away to escape, so she was fooled. From then on, the mother and daughter were lonely and looked forward to her husband's return every day, but they never saw him again. In July of this year, they unexpectedly met on the road. At that time, Aying was filled with joy and sorrow, thinking that the broken mirror could be reunited, but Zhang's attitude was completely different from the past. He regarded Aying as a stranger. Even after Aying repeatedly begged him to take her back, Zhang's heart was like a stone, and he turned and left. Aying was extremely angry at this encounter and became ill after returning home. She has only recently recovered slightly. She hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-complaint against Zhang in the First Special District District Court, saying that Zhang had abandoned her and was guilty of the crime of harming public morals under Article 244 of the Criminal Code and the crime of abandonment under Article 310. In addition to requesting the court to summon him for trial, she also filed a civil lawsuit, saying that the child was already seven years old and the annual support fee was calculated at 300 yuan, so he should pay back 2,100 yuan. Also, because the plaintiff is now twenty-three years old and has a chronic illness, she cannot remarry in the future, so the defendant should bear the maintenance fee of 360 yuan per year until the age of sixty, a total of thirty-seven years, totaling 13,320 yuan. According to the statement, the court issued a summons based on the defendant's address and sent police to summon the defendant to the Yongtaichang Foreign Goods Company across from the Sino-Western Pharmacy on the Fourth Road. At 2 p.m. yesterday, he was to attend the hearing in the Third Court. At that time, the defendant was not seen. According to the court police, there was only Zhang Wubo in the foreign goods company, not Zhang Bohe, so the summons was not accepted. Judge Xiao stated that because the defendant was not summoned to court, the case could not proceed. He then announced a postponement and waited for the defendant to be summoned before the retrial.</p>

<h3>Fuyang Taihe Disasters Heavily Ask to Add Vibration</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association of this city has determined that the bandit disasters in northern Anhui are significant, especially with the Yellow River Flood Association, so it is jointly handling the winter relief in Fuyang, Taihe, and other counties. It has publicly recommended Mr. Li Yunmen as the director of the Fuyang Relief, and now Mr. Li has gone to Fuyang to handle the matter. The association received a telegram from County Magistrate Nan Yuejun of Fuyang yesterday, saying that after the arrival of Committee Member Yunmen in Fuyang, due to the severity of the disaster and the lack of funds, he returned to Shanghai to seek benefits and pray for the increase of vibration. Indeed, the disaster victims in Fuyang are numerous and the situation is tragic. County Magistrate Nan is concerned and asks for relief for the people. The association's relief funds have dried up, and there is no way to appeal. For Fuyang Relief, it is clear that it is a drop in the bucket, but it is already exhausted. If there is no great philanthropist who generously donates a large sum of money, there is no power to increase it.</p>
<h3>Aviation Administration Presents Pamphlets</h3>
<p>The Second World War is already brewing, and the great powers are preparing for war urgently. There is a tendency to trigger it at any time. Our country is between Japan, Russia and the United States, and it is necessary to have full preparations, and the promotion of aviation is especially urgent. In order to popularize public education and instill the latest aviation knowledge, the Aviation Administration has specially compiled a variety of aviation pamphlets. The content is divided into flight stories, aviation knowledge, driving methods, and so on. The text goes from shallow to deep, which is very suitable for primary and secondary school students and the general public to read and use as supplementary textbooks. Each week a new one is published. The first issue of the inaugural issue, "Glorious War," has already been published. It is to commemorate the bloody battle of our air force in the January 28th Incident, totaling tens of thousands of words, dozens of air combat photos, a colored art cover, and excellent printing. Students who want to ask for a copy can send a letter to the Aviation Pamphlet Editorial Department, Intelligence Department, Aviation Administration, Hangzhou, and it will be sent immediately. However, there are not many books left, and they will be given away until they are gone.</p>
<h3>A New Era in the Calendar World</h3>
<p>The Era of Opera Face Calendars is Extremely Popular</p>
<p>Zhang Guangyu, manager of the Era Publishing Company, has devoted himself to the study of art in our national folk art and has a deep understanding of creation. In view of the fact that the calendars that accompany us throughout the year are often terrible, he specially made an opera face calendar to circulate. The style is small and exquisite, and the various opera faces are especially beautiful and elegant. It has been found that opera faces in our country have a strong sense of pattern, and the colors are also very beautiful. Now, by attaching them to the calendar, there is an intention to promote folk art in the beautification of the calendar. There are more than 50 kinds of face offerings printed this time, all of which are quiet and exquisite. Since its circulation, the sales have been extremely large. There are very few left and they are sold at the Era Publishing Company, No. 91, Fourth Road, for only two dimes each, which is especially cheap.</p>
<h3>Robbery with Gunshot Wound Leading to Death</h3>
<p>Name of Robber: Xia Changgen</p>
<p>Mrs. Gao Wu, a woman from Songjiang, thirty-five years old, and her son Gao Junqing, are currently employed as servants at the residence of a Mr. Ma, located at No. 22 Baojian Road, French Concession. Recently, their employer had business at Room 409, China Hotel on Guizhou Road. On the morning of the 25th of this month, Mrs. Gao and her son, with the permission of their employer, went to the hotel to bathe. After finishing around eleven o'clock, Mrs. Gao hired a rickshaw, and her son rode a bicycle. They were returning together when, unexpectedly, on Guangxi Road at the intersection of Youtou Road, a gold earring she was wearing was snatched away by a thief who emerged from the Fuzhi Alley. Upon realizing this, Mrs. Gao shouted loudly for help to catch the thief. Her son also saw this and joined in the cries and chased after the thief. A Chinese constable, No. 2079, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. He ordered the thief to stop, but he refused, causing the constable to fire a shot, which struck a vital point. The thief immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. The constable then reported to the Old Gate Police Station, which dispatched an ambulance to take the thief to the police hospital for treatment. However, the treatment was ineffective, and he died from his injuries the day before yesterday. An investigation by Detective Wang Yifei revealed that the deceased's name was Xia Changgen, 21 years old, from Ningbo. The original stolen gold earring was found on his person. The body was transported to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, along with medical examiners Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. After questioning Mrs. Gao Wu and Gao Junqing, who recounted the events, Prosecutor Guo determined that the deceased, Xia Changgen, died from a gunshot wound to the abdomen inflicted by the constable. The body was handed over to Pushan Villa for encoffining.</p>
<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Industry Promotes Domestic Products</h3>
<p>Adopting "Great China Goods" Dyes</p>
<p>The dyeing and weaving industry in this city uses a significant amount of dyes annually, relying solely on imported products. This autumn, the Dachung Dye Factory produced domestically made dyes. After testing by the industry, the Dachung's vulcanized blue dye was found to be of excellent quality, comparable to imported dyes, and even cheaper. It was deemed satisfactory. Currently, major dyeing and weaving factories in this city, such as Hongzhang, Renfeng, Guangzhong, Dachengfeng, Dafeng, Guanghua, Yangmeifeng, Qiming, Jiuyi, etc., as well as the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company and the China Weaving Company, have all purchased domestic dyes from the Dachung factory to save substantial foreign exchange losses. This is truly good news for domestic goods this year.</p>
<h3>Da Lun Silk and Satin Store Gifts Opening Performance Scripts</h3>
<p>The business of the Da Lun Silk and Satin Store on Nanjing Road has been developing well, with the highest sales volume of domestic silk and satin. In recent years, the Chinese people have vigorously promoted domestic products, and the manufacturers have spared no effort in researching and producing new products that are constantly innovating. Previously, the brocade crepe sold in the market was made with rayon backing, which was hard and not soft. Now, the Da Lun Silk and Satin Store has new brocade crepe made entirely of factory silk, which is exceptionally soft and elegant, with novel and refined patterns. It can be considered the best quality clothing material among domestic silk and satin, and it is extremely suitable for making leather clothing. The prices are extremely fair, which is very popular with customers. Furthermore, to enhance the interest of radio listeners, the store has specially printed a large book of "Opening Performance" scripts for storytelling, containing over a hundred. These are given as gifts to customers who patronize the store.</p>

<h3>Office Paper Seller at Jiangbei Public Toilet Commits Suicide Due to Poverty and Illness</h3>
<p>Liu Xinzheng, a 54-year-old man from Jiangbei, lived at No. 14 Taiping Bridge, French Concession. He was a seller of toilet paper at the public toilet near Qipu Road, North Shanxi Road, which was established by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. His income was meager. Recently, he became old and weak, and he often fell ill. Although he sought medical treatment, it was ineffective, making his economic situation even more difficult. The night before last, he felt overwhelmed by poverty and illness and decided to take his own life. He hanged himself at the entrance of the toilet. At around 3:00 AM the next morning, a Chinese constable, No. 64, from the Huisi Police Station, noticed him while patrolling the area. He immediately took him down, but he was already cold and lifeless. He immediately notified the police station, which ordered Detective Zhuge Qian to investigate. The body was then transported to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was requested to send Prosecutor Guo Wei to the office to examine the body. After questioning Chinese Constable No. 64, who reported the discovery, Prosecutor Guo determined that the deceased, Liu Xinzheng, male, had died by hanging himself. The body was handed over to his nephew, Liu Xizi, who signed a statement to claim it for coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Lu Caisheng Dies Tragically After Eating Pufferfish</h3>
<p>Entire Family Eats, One Person Poisoned</p>
<p>Wife, Children, and Both Sons and Daughters Show No Ill Effects</p>
<p>Lu Caisheng, a 36-year-old boatman from Yuncaobang, Wusong, had a wife, three sons, and two daughters. The day before yesterday afternoon, his wife bought two fresh pufferfish to cook for dinner. She first cooked them in the stove. At that time, Caisheng had just returned from a business trip to Baotaiwan. His wife served him a bowl of fish to eat with his rice. The rest of the fish was placed in a warm pot for the children to eat as they cooked it. Unexpectedly, after the meal, Caisheng felt numbness all over his body and knew something was wrong. He immediately went ashore to buy reeds and green fruits to try to save himself, but the poisoning was too deep. He received ineffective medical treatment and died tragically in the middle of the night. Yesterday, a coffin was prepared for his burial. However, his wife and children, who also ate the fish, showed no ill effects. This is both fortunate and unfortunate.</p>

<h3>Railway Operations and the Coming Year's Plans for Intermodal Transport (Continued)</h3>
<p>(B) Vigorously Implementing Responsible Intermodal Transport of Goods on National Railways: The railways of various parts of the country are like the blood vessels of a person's body. Only when each road is connected to each other, the branches and trunks maintain each other, and the distant and near correspond to each other, can the effect of concerted cooperation and smooth transportation be achieved. If each road governs itself and does not have a connection with each other, it is like the blood vessels in various parts of the human body being unconnected. Even if the local part is complete and healthy, the entire human body will inevitably be unsustainable. This is clear and should be deeply understood. Intermodal transport of railways in our country was started 20 years ago. Due to repeated disasters and lack of talent, the intermodal transport business is still extremely immature. Although passenger transport has been reorganized and improved, it is still far from the realm of perfection. As for the intermodal transport of goods, it has been completely suspended since the Republic of China. Checking the relationship between the intermodal transport of goods and the national economy and people's livelihood is twice as close and twice as important as passenger transport. At a time when the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, it has been allowed to reach this point. Although this is due to external resistance, it is also due to the fact that the railway itself has not done its best. Therefore, in the past year or so, while promoting responsible transport on each road, we have also promoted responsible intermodal transport on each road. It cannot be said that the function of transportation is fully fulfilled if there is transportation without responsibility. It cannot be said that the function of transportation is fully fulfilled if there is responsibility without intermodal transport. It must be that each road can be responsible for intermodal transport before it can be said that the function of transportation has been fully fulfilled and the practical benefits for merchants and the people can be achieved. On September 1, 21 years ago, Jinpu, Jinghu, and Huhangyong Roads implemented responsible transportation, and on October 1, they implemented responsible intermodal transport. It is a pity that other roads did not fully join due to various relationships and difficulties, and only agreed to partial intermodal transport. The method is not unified, and freight transport is naturally hindered. In order to break through this difficulty, we gathered colleagues from the Business Department Intermodal Transport Office and the Goods Responsible Transportation Committee of the Ministry to compile the Provisional Measures for Responsible Freight Intermodal Transport on Railways. Based on theory and with reference to the facts, it took several months and dozens of meetings to complete. In September 22, the Ministry convened the 16th National Intermodal Transport Conference, and all intermodal transport measures were separately determined and scheduled to be implemented on November 1. What should be strived for thereafter is strict implementation and maximum promotion, so that 23 years of the Republic of China can be the time for the revival of freight intermodal transport on railways in our country.</p>
<p>(C) Implementing Water and Land Intermodal Transport: Railways are a sharp tool for land transportation, and ships are a sharp tool for water transportation. A country's territory has land and water. Railways should not only be connected to each other, but also be connected to ships. Only then can a country's transportation be called convenient, and the transportation of passengers and goods can be agile. This is a long-standing goal of water and land intermodal transport. The only state-run waterway transport agency in our country with a relatively complete scale is the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. If you want the early realization of water and land intermodal transport, the only way is for state-owned roads to engage in intermodal transport with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as soon as possible. Therefore, at the 16th National Intermodal Transport Conference, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was invited to join in the compilation of water and land intermodal transport measures. It was decided that the Intermodal Transport Office of the Ministry would represent state-owned roads and sign an intermodal transport contract with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company based on the established measures. Then, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will negotiate with the relevant roads to negotiate detailed rules for intermodal transport. These contracts and detailed rules have now been negotiated and are ready to be announced and implemented. All passengers and goods in coastal and Yangtze River ports can be intermodal transported with state-owned roads.</p>
<p>(D) Preparing for Railway-Automobile Intermodal Transport: Railways are intermodal transported with each other, and railways are intermodal transported with ships. However, under today's circumstances, it is still not possible to complete the intermodal transport of a country's transportation agencies. In addition to railways and ships, there are also two types of transportation agencies: air transportation and automobile transportation. Air transportation is still in its infancy, and its intermodal transport with railways can be discussed later. However, railway-automobile intermodal transport needs to be actively carried out. The reason is that automobile transportation has been developing rapidly in recent years, with a trend of rapid development. The situation in foreign countries will not be discussed here. In our country, although the construction of highways and the preparation of automobiles by various provinces and individuals are in the midst of national crisis, there is still a vigorous trend. The highways in our country are rarely parallel to the railways, and are mostly extended from a certain station on the railway to a certain place in the interior. These small towns and remote areas are mostly unreachable by railways, and all their transactions and transfers depend on automobiles. If they can be intermodal transported with railways, the agricultural, mining, and forestry products of the interior areas through which the automobile roads pass can be exported by automobiles, and the manufactured products of the cities reached by the railways can be imported by railways. At the same time, due to convenient transportation, the number of passengers between urban and rural areas and the number of trips per person will gradually increase. Then, the railway will be the transfer station for automobiles, and the automobile will be the nutrient line for the railway. Each will benefit from the other and complement each other. It goes without saying that both railways and automobiles will benefit from this, and it will be more helpful to facilitate commerce and tourism, develop industries, develop the national economy, and communicate social culture. Therefore, the preparation of railway-automobile intermodal transport is also a current and urgent task. The outline of railway-automobile intermodal transport was also discussed and decided at the 16th National Intermodal Transport Conference. It is planned that each road will investigate the relevant automobile roads and negotiate intermodal transport measures based on the previous outline to facilitate transportation and benefit merchants and the people.

<h3>Thinking about the Inauguration of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the Civil War</h3>
<p>— Sincerity</p>
<p>I feel that "national crisis" is not really something to grieve over, nor something to mourn. If everyone can clearly understand the relationship of the national crisis and their own responsibilities, resolving the national crisis would not be difficult. Perhaps the entire nation could even be invigorated and strengthened by it. The most heartbreaking thing is nothing other than "civil war"!</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the old man's handling was improper or not, I believe that on this dilapidated ship, if everyone insists on causing internal strife, then there will only be one outcome: mutual destruction! We can completely disregard major issues such as international status, world trends, and plunder by powerful neighbors, etc., and just take the small Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway as an example to make everyone clearly aware of the lamentable nature of civil war!</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was initiated by Mr. Zhang Jingjiang. Over the years, thanks to the Zhejiang Construction Department's arduous efforts, it was built using the most economical methods. This railway, which is 360 kilometers long, has now been fully completed. The convenience it offers to merchants and people in the western Zhejiang area is truly immeasurable. What makes us especially happy are two points: first, the construction engineering of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was entirely planned by our Chinese experts, and no foreigners were ever consulted; second, although the funding for the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway also came from mortgages, it never borrowed a single penny of foreign debt. Therefore, I feel that even if the transportation function of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is not considered, its planning and construction alone can be said to be a glorious chapter in Chinese construction history. However, unfortunately, just as it was fully completed, and passenger and freight trains could directly travel between the Jiangbian and Yushan areas, the detestable civil war was launched from Fujian, and it happened to be nearby. Let us think about it: such a good construction project, not to mention the material aspect, but only in terms of the spiritual aspect, if it is truly damaged or halted due to military affairs, wouldn't that be like a very good painting, just completed by an artist with much effort, suddenly being torn to shreds by someone, spoiling the beautiful scenery?</p>
<p>I love my motherland and only hope that it can have a day of revival. Every time I see a new construction, my heart always has indescribable joy. However, even if there is new construction but it is immediately destroyed, it is even more heartbreaking than not having construction at all.</p>
<p>Friends, is there a way to stop the civil war? I pray for your great invention!</p>
<h3>Nanjing Songstress Praised by French Novelist</h3>
<p>— Chun Liu</p>
<p>French novelist de Gopeira traveled from Nanjing to Beiping and suddenly gave a "woman theory" to newspaper reporters, saying that Chinese women were indescribably beautiful, and Suzhou women were especially beautiful. He cited as evidence: "I heard Chinese songs in the Confucius Temple in Nanjing. There was a Suzhou songstress named Xue Yanqin. Her graceful demeanor on stage captivated my soul for several days," and so on. As a result, he was protested by Beiping female writer Pan Junying, who criticized de Gopeira as an uncultured person, saying that he looked down on Chinese women.</p>
<p>Regarding this case, we will not discuss how de Gopeira will answer. However, we in Nanjing know for sure that there is no Xue Yanqin among the songstresses in the Confucius Temple. We only know that there is a Xue Youqin who sings Qingyi roles at the Star Theatre, and she is not called Xue Yanqin (the old star Yanqin has already married in Beiping). In de Gopeira's original remarks, he mentioned something about graceful demeanor on stage, which proves that he was definitely not referring to the women in the "flower tea houses" of the Confucius Temple, but rather the Kunling Xue Youqin in the old-style theaters.</p>
<p>But who is Xue Youqin? It is said that she is Rong Lijuan's fellow apprentice, Rong Sujuan, both from Mu Zhitian's school. This time, when she performed in Beijing, she was heavily promoted by several wealthy people, and de Gopeira was led by these wealthy people when he visited the Star Theatre that day to appreciate the graceful demeanor of this typical Suzhou woman.</p>
<h3>Liking to Stay in Bed</h3>
<p>— Chuan Yizhi</p>
<p>The light yellow morning sun slants onto the upper end of the wall across from my garret, indicating that it is already past seven o'clock; although the warmth in the worn-out quilt feels very tempting, I dare not let go and close my drowsy eyes again, because I am concerned about the eight o'clock morning class, fearing that if I fall asleep, I will delay the classes of all the young ladies.</p>
<p>However, although my eyes are forced to open, my body is always lazy and unwilling to "move the venue," as if sleeping a little longer would be like taking a "Shiquan Dabu Wan" (Ten-Ingredient Tonic Pill) or getting a "blood-boosting shot," which would definitely restore the fatigue of yesterday's all-day work.</p>
<p>The morning sun on the upper end of the wall gradually moves to the window lattice below, as if telling me: this is already the time to continue forward on your life journey. It—the morning sun is what I consider the only accurate clock; although it will hide on cloudy and rainy days, making me unable to distinguish between early and late, I must wipe my face, brush my teeth, and put on my clothes; I must also run that mile-long road—a road full of chamber pots and vendors, in that tense battlefield of life, which is unwilling to let me, a wounded soldier, "go AWOL." Naturally, I cannot but clench my teeth, throw aside this lover—the worn-out quilt—that has followed me for seven or eight years, and jump up to catch up with the team in the midst of bugle calls.</p>
<p>Those who return from dancing late at night, sleeping head-to-head with their beloved wives, are the favored children of heaven, the uncrowned kings; at the same time, they are also obstacles in the path of human evolution. In this society that is actively brewing drastic changes, they are the last batch of those who are infatuated with a life of leisure, I have cursed them in this way. But, humans seem to exist for enjoyment, and if they have a moment to spare, they want even more comfort; I am still reluctant to part with this warm worn-out quilt, how can I blame them for indulging in their inherent happiness?</p>
<p>If I had a life that was more superior than reality, or equal to theirs, I would have to give them more sympathy, would this idea be wrong?</p>
<h3>The Difficulty of Opening the City God Temple and Yu Garden</h3>
<p>— Gao Yahun</p>
<p>The Yu Garden of the Shanghai City God Temple was originally divided into the Inner Garden, Outer Garden, and Dianchun Hall. The Outer Garden is the Nine-Bend Bridge and other places we often visit. The Inner Garden and Dianchun Hall are not often open. They are only opened during major festivals such as the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Dragon Boat Festival, allowing visitors to enter and tour. At other times, the double doors are tightly closed, and those who do not know people or have power are not allowed to enter and sightsee. It is a waste that such a great garden cannot be publicly exhibited and is only for the enjoyment of one or two private individuals. In 1929, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau once proposed to open Yu Garden for public enjoyment, but the result was not realized. A few days ago, a foreign engineer from the Municipal Works Bureau happened to be in the mood for a garden tour, so he borrowed a few Chinese colleagues and went to the City God Temple to tour the Inner Garden, Outer Garden, and Dianchun Hall. He felt that the scenery was secluded and the decorations were pleasant. It was a pity to keep it closed like this. After returning, he suggested to the Works Bureau to find a way to open it for citizens to tour. The Works Bureau accepted the foreign engineer's proposal and convened a joint meeting with the Education Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Social Bureau to discuss the opening method. The results were reported to the municipal government for approval. If approved, they would proceed with the second step of the opening procedure. Who knew that the municipal government would review the old case files and find that the three houses in the Inner Garden, Outer Garden, and Dianchun Hall all had owners in charge, and there was also a sugar industry elementary school and the industry association in Dianchun Hall. If opened, there would definitely be problems first. Moreover, the houses in Yu Garden have been built for many years, some have not been repaired, and some are already collapsing. After opening, there would definitely be danger. In addition, the roads are narrow, and even in the widest places, there are only three feet of space. If it is made a public tourist area, there will be crowding if there are too many tourists. With these difficulties, the opening of the City God Temple and Yu Garden was invisibly cancelled and became a permanently secret scenic spot.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders in the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-One: Whispered Words Under the Lamp, Heartfelt Advice to a Weak Daughter; Walking with a Cane on the Mountain, Coldly Watching Heroes</p>
<p>While he was looking at the ground, he struggled hard, and blurted out a sentence, which was: Does Second Master only know this today? Ji Zhiyue was standing not far in front of him, but the sentence he said could not be heard clearly. However, it could be seen that he was deliberately using a question to evade the topic. Ji Zhiyue thought to himself, he is already troubled enough, things have come to this, it is almost like flowing water and falling flowers, spring is gone. Today, I blocked him until dark, so what? So he smiled at him: Since I returned to Haidian, I have been thinking of visiting your residence and thanking the Zhao family's old master. Unexpectedly, my elder brother's illness has been lingering on and on without any sign of improvement. I have to take care of things inside and out, and I can't spare an hour or two. So one day passed after another, and this matter was delayed. If I have time tomorrow or the day after, I will definitely come to your residence to visit. Go back and please say hello to Madam for me, goodbye! After saying this, he put on his hat and walked away with a bow. Gui Zhi stood in the same place, not leaving an inch, turning around and just looking at Ji Zhiyue's back. Later, two children from the neighborhood ran to her side and asked: Sister Yang, what are you doing standing here? Did you lose something? Gui Zhi then woke up and smiled: Isn't that right? I lost a small key. The two children actually believed it and started looking on the ground. Gui Zhi stopped them and said: Little brothers, don't look, I might have left this small key at home. So she stepped forward, touched the heads of the two children, and went home. Upon entering the door, she bumped into her mother, Jiang Shi. Seeing that Gui Zhi had quietly gone out earlier and now quietly returned, she couldn't help but feel suspicious, so she stared at her face. Seeing that her face was red, she felt even more uneasy, so she said: Your health hasn't been very good these past few days, so rest more at home. The weather is also very cool, don't go out and catch a cold again. (279)</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Feeble Cries</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xiang</p>
<p>(1) Can You Bear to Call Me "Mr."?</p>
<p>Dear Wife:</p>
<p>Can you bear to call me "Mr."? Yes, in the past—five years ago—we used to call each other "Mr." and "Ms." for a while, but what is our relationship now? You are my wife, I am your husband, the father and mother of Yu'er—can you bear to call me "Mr."?</p>
<p>Ever since I came back from the shop the day before yesterday and saw Yu'er crying alone in the room, her eyes swollen and her voice hoarse, I was very surprised! Later, I also saw that your clothes were all gone. At first, I thought you had gone to a relative's house in a fit of anger, but I held Yu'er and went to inquire at every house, my legs were sore and my mouth was hoarse, running from dusk until midnight, and I still didn't see you. Yu'er was in my arms, and although she was asleep because she was too tired, she would still call out "Mommy!" in her sleep! Alas, my dear, if you exchanged my position, I'm afraid you would also be heartbroken!</p>
<p>My dear, my inability to allow you to have a fake woolen coat is really because the business in the shop has been too bad this year. The salary is owed, how can I pre-pay? Because of the economic panic. The year before last, when you asked me to make a gray-backed cheongsam, didn't I immediately agree to you? You are an educated woman, I think you wouldn't divorce me just because of these material things! Yu'er has been running a fever because she hasn't seen you for five days. My dear, come back!</p>
<p>(2) Just Need a Mouthful of Food</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-So:</p>
<p>It has been almost a year since the Rose Store closed down that I have been unemployed. During this year, although I have been running around trying to find a job to make a living, the year is so bleak that all the shops are embracing a tight policy, only choosing to lay off batches of partners, and absolutely not hiring new partners. Even if a few new shops open, the paper notices from their preparatory offices are just posted, but the staff inside have already been internally determined. People like me who are not well-informed always come back disappointed after hearing the news and running there. However, the various living expenses of my family, such as food, clothing, and housing, cannot be stopped because I am unemployed. Alas! Although I have tried my best to save money during this year, I have been patching here and there, and it is terribly miserable!</p>
<p>Now you, Mr., are preparing for the "National Goods Shopping Mall." When I heard the news, it was really like finding a bright lamp in the vast dark night! Mr., aren't you very fond of me, and aren't you a universally admired charitable person? I don't know how many people are living off of you. Please have pity on me and give me some work! I dare not argue about the amount of salary, as long as you can give me a mouthful of food, I will be very grateful. Waiting for your reply, so that I can come to you in person for instruction...</p>
<p>(3) The Devil of Sickness Will Never Let You Go Just Because You Are Poor</p>
<p>Old Brother So-and-So:</p>
<p>I am really ashamed that I have not been able to return your loan earlier, but now my illness has still not healed. Of course, I cannot work, but I cannot but ask for a doctor; although Dr. Wang treats me specially, I still have to pay for the half-dollar fare and the medicine expenses at the pharmacy. Although the newspaper office where I work considers my situation and still pays me half of my salary so that I can receive a salary while lying down, I still have to pay for medical expenses in addition to the daily expenses of the family. It is really a stretch, and I cannot make ends meet. However, if I don't see a doctor, it will really affect my life; if I see a doctor, I don't have the money. Being sick when you are poor is really the most bitter and miserable thing, but the hateful devil of sickness will not entangle you just because you are a poor person! Old brother, you are my most intimate friend, please help me with some material help...</p>
<p>In this bleak year, such tragic letters are often found in society. Then, what kind of influence this faint cry can have on those who hear it is within an unknowable number. However, although the effect of the cry is unknowable, the cry of the cry is still permeating society, this is the so-called modern scene!</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Plans to Issue Education Funds</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Middle School and Normal School have been notified that the funds for the first half of October have been issued (the Rural Normal School and Experimental Elementary School are for the first half of November, the Vocational School and Social Education Institutions are for the second half of October). The funds have been issued by the Education Funds Management Office and can now be collected separately. It is reported that the Education Funds Management Office, in addition to issuing the funds for this half month, the winter study abroad funds, and two months of food expenses for the normal schools, now has about 50,000 yuan in its treasury. To continue issuing the funds for the second half of the month, it is still short 90,000 yuan. It is now issuing orders to various counties and sending personnel to urge the payment of land tax and slaughter tax. The fund issuance notification for the second half of October for middle schools and normal schools (the second half of November for rural normal schools and experimental elementary schools, the first half of November for social education and vocational schools) will be issued within this month. However, as the Gregorian New Year approaches, banks will be closed for business. The funds will be received by various schools around January 1. The Jiangsu Education Funds Audit Committee held a meeting yesterday and signed the fund issuance notification for the first half of November for middle schools and normal schools (the first half of December for rural normal schools and experimental elementary schools, the second half of November for social education and vocational education). It was sent to the Education Department for stamping on the 27th. The schools hope to receive the funds for this half month before the winter vacation on January 18. The issuance of this notification must wait until the above-mentioned half-month fund notification (the second half of October for middle schools, the second half of November for rural normal schools and experimental elementary schools) has been received before it can be issued, around the beginning of January. It is also reported that the Management Office borrowed 400,000 yuan from various counties for this year's winter irrigation. Due to the impact of the current situation, it was not possible to do so immediately. Now, the first batch of counties has reported that they can borrow approximately tens of thousands of yuan. Only half of the funds have been transferred to the treasury, about 70,000 yuan. They are currently being urged separately. It is expected that the funds for the half-month to be issued within this month and the half-month funds before the winter vacation on January 18 will not have any problems.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Orders Promulgation of Method for Spot-Checking Elementary School Students' Grades</h3>
<p>Spot-checking is divided into total testing, temporary testing, and joint testing</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department believes that the methods for spot-checking elementary school grades in various counties and cities in the province are inconsistent and the standards are different, and there should be unified regulations. Since the Ministry of Education temporarily exempted the elementary school graduation examinations, it is even more necessary for various counties and cities to universally conduct spot-checks to rectify the academic performance of elementary school students. The Zhejiang Provincial Education Department has specially ordered the promulgation of an outline of the Zhejiang Provincial Method for Spot-Checking the Academic Performance of Elementary School Students in Various Counties and Cities, ordering uniform compliance. The outline of the method is recorded below: 1. The Education Department, in order to rectify the academic performance of elementary school students in various counties and cities, specially formulates the Zhejiang Provincial Method for Spot-Checking the Academic Performance of Elementary School Students in Various Counties and Cities. All counties and cities must conduct spot-checks in accordance with this method outline. 2. Each county and city will conduct the examination separately for students in the third grade and above. 3. The schools, grades, and subjects to be spot-checked will be determined by each county and city based on the results of the inspection, and those deemed necessary will be examined. A total spot-check of the entire county and city may also be conducted in light of the circumstances of each county and city. 4. When conducting spot-checks, each county and city should have the inspectors conduct them temporarily while inspecting each school. However, they may also gather students of the same grade from nearby schools to conduct the examination together in one place. 5. The test questions for the spot-check subjects and the standards for grading the results will be handled by the staff of the Education Bureau in each county and city, who will be responsible for organizing the Elementary School Student Performance Spot-Check Committee. If a total spot-check of the entire county and city is conducted, the members of this committee may hire a number of people who are not related to the schools being spot-checked to serve as members. 6. After conducting the spot-check, if any county or city finds that the performance of all students in a grade in a certain subject is too poor, the school should be warned to find ways to remedy it and urged to improve. 7. After the end of each semester, each county and city should submit a list to the Education Department for record, detailing the schools, grades, number of people, subjects, total scores, and handling process of the spot-checks conducted in a semester. 8. The detailed spot-check methods should be formulated by each county and city and submitted to the Education Department for record. 9. The expenses used for handling spot-check matters in each county and city will be paid from the education funds of each county and city. 10. This method outline will be implemented from the date of its formulation and promulgation by the Education Department.</p>

<h3>Jidda Middle School Department Resumes Classes Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Middle School Principal Position Temporarily Held Concurrently by President Zheng</p>
<p>Director Pan Issues Statement Hoping for Proper Handling</p>
<p>(China and Foreign News Agency) According to reports, a disturbance occurred in the Jidda University Department in West Shanghai. This agency's reporter specially drove to Zhenru yesterday to investigate. It was learned that the cause of the disturbance was purely due to external incitement, resulting in a sudden strike. However, after only one day, the situation took a sharp turn for the better. President Zheng Hongnian issued two notices, and students voluntarily resumed classes. When the reporter arrived at the school, order had already returned to normal, and the sounds of reading were heard again. Zheng also reported the resumption of classes to the Ministry of Education. The so-called fleeting disturbance has come to an end. The texts of Zheng's notices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Notice One Regarding the matter of this notice: Since Mr. Kuang Songling has been in charge of the Middle School Department of this school, he has carried out reforms and rectifications, and the teaching and management have been strict, and the discipline has been excellent. This president has been very pleased with this. Unexpectedly, a few students were suddenly incited by unscrupulous elements outside the school the day before yesterday, causing an incident, which is truly distressing. It must be known that young people are full of vitality and easily agitated. Director Kuang has always been earnest in his hopes for the students, and his reprimands may have been overly strict. However, my students should understand his good intentions and encourage themselves even more. How can they recklessly listen to others and indulge their nature? Impulsively, they acted according to their likes and dislikes, not hesitating to create unnecessary problems. One person sang, and a hundred followed, eventually turning wrong into right. The central government has repeatedly issued orders to rectify education. At a time when the situation is turbulent, the security of Shanghai is particularly important. This president cannot bear to see a very small number of my students implicate the majority of the innocent. Moreover, the Middle School Department of this school has a long history, and this president has laid the foundation and expanded it later, and the relationship is extremely close. Therefore, I cannot let go. From this day forward, all the powers and responsibilities of the Middle School Principal will be temporarily held concurrently by this president until Director Kuang returns to school. I hope that all students will concentrate on their studies, and all disputes will be handled carefully by this president. This president has always been warm-hearted in his care for students. If there are still those who are obstinate and disregard the overall situation, then the school rules are in place, and it will not be difficult to use them to enforce discipline. Let each of you be respectful of this notice.</p>
<p>Notice Two Regarding the matter of this notice: The Middle School Department of this school has recently experienced some disturbances, which are currently being handled personally by this president. All my teachers and staff, who hold leadership positions, should each take responsibility and set an example. Please do not be absent without reason or leave your posts without permission. In addition to the Registration Office strictly verifying attendance, this notice is hereby issued.</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The Affiliated Middle School of National Jidda University experienced a situation where a portion of students, dissatisfied with the strict policies of the Middle School Principal Kuang Songling, surrounded the principal and expelled teachers and staff the day before yesterday morning. The situation was extremely serious at one point. After President Zheng issued a notice and reprimanded the students yesterday, the situation has eased, and students are attending classes as usual. Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau also issued a statement. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident According to Shanghai News Agency reporters, the cause of this disturbance is that the Middle School Principal Kuang Songling has been extremely strict in managing students on weekdays, and he often checks students' correspondence, which has led to opposition from some students and the brewing of this disturbance.</p>
<p>Truth of the Outbreak At 9:00 AM on the 26th, when the first class was over and the second class was about to begin, suddenly a group of about 20 to 30 students surrounded the principal's office and various department offices, expelling a small number of teachers and staff. However, it was found that only a small number of high school and normal school students participated at the time, and most of the other students did not participate, and there were no rude or barbaric actions, nor were there any incidents of holding copper pillars or iron axes as weapons.</p>
<p>Classes Resume as Usual After the incident occurred, President Zheng arrived at the school that afternoon and severely reprimanded the students, immediately restoring order. Students resumed self-study as usual in the evening, and classes have also resumed as usual since 9:00 AM yesterday. However, a small number of teachers and staff have not yet returned to school, and President Zheng has sent letters to inform them. Before Middle School Principal Kuang Songling returns to school, all principal duties will be temporarily held concurrently by President Zheng.</p>
<p>Director Pan's Statement Yesterday, Shanghai News Agency reporters visited Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau and asked for his opinion on this case. Director Pan immediately stated that he was deeply saddened to learn about the disturbance at the Affiliated Middle School of Jidda University as reported in today's newspapers. The Education Bureau is currently sending personnel to investigate this case. He sincerely hopes that the school authorities, for the sake of rectifying discipline, should assess the students' likes and dislikes and handle the matter properly. At the same time, they should prioritize the students' studies and not allow the affairs of a few people to affect the studies of the entire student body. This is what he particularly hopes for, he said.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal People's Education Center believes that pasting spring couplets on New Year's Day is a long-standing tradition in our country. However, the words and phrases often contain feudalistic ideas, which are detrimental to the people's concepts. In order to improve this situation, several thousand new spring couplets have been specially written. In addition to having the center instruct staff to paste them along the doors of households on New Year's Eve, the public is also welcome to send letters to the center to request them.</p>

<h3>Final Act of Jiangnan University Football League: Jidda vs. Fudan</h3>
<p>3:00 PM Today at the Baseball Field</p>
<p>The Championship Depends Entirely on the Outcome of This Match</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University Sports Association Football League has one game remaining: Jidda vs. Fudan. It is scheduled to be held at the China Baseball Field at 3:00 PM today. This match is the key to resolving the championship. Fudan has already lost once and drawn once, so there is no hope of winning the championship. Jidda has won all five of its matches, so it has the highest call for winning the championship. However, if Jidda loses to Fudan, then the situation between Jidda and Jiaotong Universities will be equal, and the winner of the championship will need to be decided in a final match. If Jidda draws or wins against Fudan, then Jidda will continue to maintain its leadership. Today's match is very important, and both sides have excellent strength. It is sure to be a spectacle.</p>

<h3>Charity Football Match Proceeds: Xie Jin Hui Donates 1,000 Yuan to Aid Yellow River Disaster</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sports Promotion Association previously received a letter from the United Relief Association for the Yellow River Flood Disaster, stating that the Yellow River disaster was severe and in urgent need of relief. Despite repeated fundraising efforts, the amount raised was insufficient to make a difference. The association was requested to hold a football match to raise funds to help the relief efforts. However, the association has regulations regarding charity matches, holding them twice a year. After receiving the letter, the association, considering the urgent need for rescue, held a match with a Western football team last Saturday. Of the 4,000+ yuan raised from ticket sales, after the Western team took half, the remaining 2,000 yuan was decided to be allocated to four charitable organizations. The association, considering the large amount of funds needed for the Yellow River disaster, specially allocated 1,000 yuan and delivered it to the Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief Association yesterday to be remitted to the disaster area for distribution.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Basketball Team Defeats St. John's in Friendly Match</h3>
<p>Zhejiang University's Passing and Shooting Were Excellent</p>
<p>Result: 42 to 36</p>
<p>After the Zhejiang University basketball team arrived in Shanghai, they played their first match against St. John's University last night, held in the St. John's Recreation Room. Due to the dim lighting and poor visibility, movement was affected. Zhejiang University relied on Miao Mei's short passes and accurate shooting to defeat St. John's 42 to 36. However, the score fluctuated during the match, and the situation was quite tense.</p>
<p>The entire Zhejiang University team was balanced, with good offense and defense. Wang Di'an and Qi Guangyu's shots were accurate and confident. Wang Pusheng's support made the whole team work seamlessly, and Shi Hengyuan's defense was well-positioned and controlled. The team has made a lot of progress compared to when they came to Shanghai last winter. Their victory over St. John's was not accidental. St. John's lost because their defense was weak, their coordination was unfamiliar, and their shooting was inaccurate. They were fortunate to lose by only six points.</p>
<p>One-Point Difference After the referee Shen Siliang ordered the game to begin, Qi Guangyu of Zhejiang University scored the first point. Zhou Xuexian of St. John's made a layup under the basket, tying the score 2-2. After that, Zhejiang University's momentum increased, and their shots were accurate. The score became 8-4 and 12-6. Zhou Du of St. John's called a timeout to boost morale. Tao Zunan, Zhou Xuexian, and Wu Youliang each scored, making the score 12-12. The situation became tense. From then on, the score was very close, and it was difficult to tell who had the advantage. Wang Di'an of Zhejiang University scored on a free throw against Tao Zuran, taking the lead again 13-12. Ma Fangcui of St. John's made a layup, making the score 14-13. St. John's took the lead for the first time. However, Zhejiang University coordinated their offense, and their formation was tight. Wang Di'an scored repeatedly, taking the lead again 21-16. St. John's made every effort to counterattack. Zhou Xuexian made three shots in a row, and the situation suddenly changed again. St. John's took a slight lead with a score of 22-21.</p>
<p>Turning Defeat into Victory After the first half ended, Wu Zhiyi replaced Ma Fangcui for St. John's. After Shi Hengyuan of Zhejiang University scored the first point, Wu and Zhang of St. John's scored in a row, adding six points. St. John's took the lead for the second time with a score of 28-23. However, St. John's passes were often ineffective after that, and there was no one to receive them. In addition, Zhejiang University's defenses were tight, and there was no room to take advantage of. As a result, it became Zhejiang University's game. Qi Guangyu's aim was accurate, and he made many contributions. In a short time, he scored five goals. St. John's had just risen to the blue sky and was hit hard again, falling behind 28-38. At this time, St. John's lineup was like a plate of scattered sand, while Zhejiang University's work was meticulous. Success or failure seemed to have been decided in secret. St. John's reorganized their troops and persevered. Zhou Xuexian and Ma Fangcui each made shots, but the gains did not make up for the losses. In the end, they lost 36-42. Zhejiang University will play against Western Youth at 8:20 PM tonight at the Western Youth Basketball Gym.</p>

<h3>Rear Guard Ejection Causes Full Line Collapse: Liang Hua Basketball Team Suffers Crushing Defeat to Mai Ling Last Night</h3>
<p>Liang Hua Leads All the Way - Result: 41 to 54 Defeat</p>
<p>Pu Cheng Loses to Western Youth 29 to 38</p>
<p>Tonight: Pu Cheng vs. Mai Ling; Liang Hua vs. Shanghai University, Liang Hua Requests Postponement</p>
<p>The results of last night's two basketball games are that both Liang Hua and Pu Cheng suffered crushing defeats. Pu Cheng lost to Western Youth 29 to 38, and Liang Hua lost to Mai Ling 41 to 54. Liang Hua's defeat was particularly regrettable. They broke through Mai Ling's defense in the first half and led all the way until 25 to 31. Then, both rear guards were ejected in succession, causing the entire line to collapse and eventually give up. However, they still fought to a 41-41 tie before being broken again by the enemy. Because of Liang Hua's brilliant performance, the spectators hoped for victory and, after the game, angrily blamed the referee Wu Jiatang, trying to beat him. Fortunately, he escaped without injury, which was a blemish on the otherwise good game. Pu Cheng was suppressed throughout the game against Western Youth and never managed to raise their heads. Tonight, Liang Hua will play against Shanghai University, and Pu Cheng will play against Mai Ling. However, for Shanghai University vs. Liang Hua, Liang Hua has requested a postponement.</p>
<h3>Pu Cheng Overpowered by Western Youth</h3>
<p>Pu Cheng Scores First Pu Cheng and Western Youth started playing at 7:00 PM. Western Youth attacked to the Pu Cheng basket, but the ball was intercepted by Pu Cheng and passed out. Center An Guqing ran straight to Western Youth and made a layup, Pu Cheng scored first. However, Shi Guiya of Western Youth scored one, and Smith made a free throw, taking the lead 3-2 from then on. Sun Peter scored on a free throw, tying the score. Ling En, Western Youth's tall man, scored again. After that, Western Youth maintained a lead of about ten points. The result of the first half was 22-16, with Western Youth leading by six points. In the second half, the game continued in the same situation. Although Sun Peter sometimes made brilliant shots, he still couldn't catch up. As a result, Western Youth defeated them 38 to 29.</p>
<p>Western Youth Not as Good as Before The skill of the entire Western Youth team seems to be not as good as before. Center Ling En, who is over six feet tall, is not very agile except for jump balls. He took advantage of his height under the basket a lot. Carlson is just so-so. Except for Shi Guiya, who is still fierce, the others have degenerated in their shooting and are not very fast. Compared to Mai Ling, they seem to be not as good. Pu Cheng's lack of agility is the reason for their defeat.</p>

<h3>Liang Hua Loses to Mai Ling</h3>
<p>A Regrettable Loss Liang Hua was leading all the way, but the two rear guards were ejected in succession, eventually leading to their inability to defend. It was a very regrettable loss. In the first half, Liang Hua's performance was particularly moving. Mai Ling, a strong team in Shanghai this year, was actually suppressed. Liang Hua's turn from victory to defeat is no wonder that a few spectators, due to emotional impulses, took extrajudicial actions and blamed the referee. However, Liang Hua's lack of a strong reserve force is also a fact. Anyone's departure from the field can shake the entire army.</p>
<p>Mai Ling's Momentum As the two armies lined up to attack, Tang Baokun made a brilliant pass to Liu Zhenyuan under the basket, who scored in one fell swoop. Liang Hua scored first, and the applause was thunderous. Mai Ling did not show any weakness. Kai Deng returned a goal, and center Locke scored twice in a row, gaining six points and taking the lead 6-2. Liang Hua worked hard to tie the score 6-6. Mai Ling then scored five points in a row, 11-6, then 13-8, with a strong momentum that was inviolable.</p>
<p>Little Tang's Show In this pessimistic situation, Tang Baokun put on a great show, running all over the field, no less vigorous than in his prime. He scored two goals in a row, and because of his brilliant pass, Liu Zhenyuan followed up and scored. In an instant, they scored eight points in a row, and Liang Hua took the lead 16-13. As a result, Liang Hua took the lead with a difference of three or four points. Although Mai Ling briefly took the lead with 24-23, Liang Hua still defeated Mai Ling 27-26 in the first half.</p>
<p>Generals Ejected Starting in the second half, Liang Hua was still in the lead, but the situation gradually deteriorated. Center Li Huizhong and rear guards Zhang Jingshi and Yin Hongxiang each had three fouls recorded. Sure enough, Yin Hongxiang was ejected when the score was 35-32. Mai Ling added one point. One minute later, Zhang Jingshi was also ejected. Mai Ling added another point. Liang Hua was shaken from then on and could not support themselves. Mai Ling scored eight points in a row, taking the lead 39-35. However, Liang Hua continued to fight and actually tied the score at 41-41. Mai Ling quickly started using fresh troops in a rotation, and from then on Liang Hua collapsed. As a result, Mai Ling won 54-41.</p>
<p>Aftermath After the battle, the spectators, seeing Liang Hua's regrettable defeat, blamed the referee for being unfair. The Westerners were fine, and no one dared to take action. Wu Jiatang was attacked by punches and kicks, but fortunately he escaped, otherwise the consequences would have been unthinkable. How emotional the spectators were!</p>

<h3>Western Youth Women's Basketball: Southeast Loses to Red Team</h3>
<p>Liangjiang Defeats Mai Ling by a Large Margin</p>
<p>Last night's Western Youth women's basketball game saw Southeast A's unexpected defeat to the Red Team. Southeast's failure was due to a lack of dedicated person in charge and the inability of the new instructor to provide guidance.

<p>(1) Red Team Defeats Southeast A 22-18</p>
<p>(2) Liangjiang Defeats Mai Ling 38-7</p>
<p>(3) American Women Defeats Elementary 43-10</p>

Southeast still did not improve in the second quarter. Clark and C. Mao Tu of the Red Team each contributed, taking the lead again 7-2. The first half ended 14-6. In the renewed battle, Southeast greatly improved, and their counterattack was fierce, showing a potential to come from behind. However, the Red Team took advantage of their victory and did not show any weakness. Southeast lost too much in the first half, and the gains did not make up for the losses in the second half. In the end, they were crushed 18-22.</p>

Although Mai Ling had no chance to attack in the first half, their defense was still tight, and they trailed only 1-11. In the third quarter, Mai Ling completely lost their ability to resist. Liangjiang's shots were like a string of beads, scoring 19 points in a row. In the last quarter, Liangjiang used second-tier players. Mai Ling struggled hard and added six points.

<h3>Pudong Yuqing Ties in the Secondary School Football Championship</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Second Final</p>
<p>2-2 Draw Again</p>
<p>—No More Finals, Each Gets the Championship—</p>
<p>The result of the first final of the Secondary School Sports Association's football championship between Yuqing and Pudong Middle Schools was a 1-1 draw. The two teams played the second final yesterday, and the result was still a 2-2 draw. In the first half, Yuqing took the lead with a score of 1-0. In the second half, Pudong also scored one. In extra time, Pudong scored first. In the last two minutes, Yuqing scored again, making it a 2-2 draw again. The two schools agreed to no longer hold a third final, and each received the same championship trophy.</p>
<p>Dividing the Spoils Equally The match started at 3 PM yesterday at the baseball field. Yuqing was on the windward side. Both teams advanced and retreated. About ten minutes after the start of the match, Yuqing advanced to outside the penalty line in front of the Pudong goal and was awarded a free kick. The goalkeeper saved it, but Yuqing's right-winger Zhang Zhonghu scored with one kick. In the second half, Pudong was on the windward side. Center-back Zhang Shi sat in the central area and continuously sent out long balls. Center forward Li Jinji charged in, and by the end of the game, each team had scored one goal. Thus, there was extra time. Pudong's Chen Chongbo took the lead and scored with one swoop, and cheers rose everywhere. Unexpectedly, in the last two minutes, Yuqing's center forward Fu Zhibin scored with one touch, and Pudong's joy returned to disappointment, resulting in a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>Each Gets a Championship After the match, the leaders of the two teams and the staff of the Association discussed the date for the third final. They all believed that the time was very short, the big exams were approaching, and both sides were feeling tired. In order to avoid disappointing either side, it was decided to divide the championship trophy equally, with each team receiving one. The existing one was drawn by Yuqing, and another one will be made to give to Pudong.</p>

<h3>Financial Silver Price Shrinks, Exchange Rate Rises, Gold Market Process Smooth</h3>
<p>The result of yesterday's gold market was still flat, but the situation was uncertain in the half-day session, and people's confidence was not stable. However, the big players bravely covered their short positions, and the market recovered after being weak. In the early morning, overseas silver markets were closed, which contracted British and American markets, causing exchange rates to rise instead. The forward silver price at the precious metals exchange fell by two to three and two tenths of a percent. The London spot gold price rose by one penny. The official US gold buying price did not move. US cotton fell by more than ten pounds per bale. US wheat rose slightly. Stocks fell by two yuan and fifty-seven cents. News reported that the US Republican Party also tended to support Roosevelt's monetary policy. It seemed that there would be no setbacks in the next Congress. People's hearts were slightly fearful. The "mao" (10% purity) market opened and immediately broke the 80-yuan mark, retreating to 78 yuan. Then, big players such as Dadecheng and Huixiang suddenly rose to cover their positions, causing it to rise back to beyond the 80-yuan mark. The opening was flat. After the opening, people's hearts were still weak, once approaching the 80-yuan mark, but because the banks' appetites were tight, buying in the market became more intense, rising successively. The midday close was equal to the pre-close. Reuters did not have any telegrams. In fact, people's hearts in the market were uncertain, with slight fluctuations. The "gechi" price was 1,062 yuan. The half-day market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 682 yuan and two corners, down two yuan from the pre-close. Goods opened at two yuan and a half. The exchange market opened with a near-term "xian" price of one shilling, three pence, eight seven five for British exchange and thirty-four yuan for US exchange. At the opening, the market seemed uncertain. Retail investors and goods sellers were aggressively pressing down. Hengyu and Yiyu also had supply. Although Dadecheng, Yuansheng, Yonghengxing advanced, it still fell to 80 yuan and three corners. After entering, Dadecheng still bought vigorously, and it returned to good.

Yesterday, after the cessation of the December futures, only one month of futures was made in January, and February's futures had to wait until the 30th to be launched.

Throughout the day, the trend was that the short position had no way out, and the market price had a soaring trend. The future seemed to have a rising trend.

<h3>Bull Position in the Standard Flower Market is Solidified</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm because the sentiment of the buyers is strong, and the Yonggang and Shanghai cotton merchants are all in the bull position, and the amount of absorption is huge, so the supply is relatively dry. The situation of the US cotton is still weak, but Rui Da Company is acting on behalf of Chongxin Factory to exchange a huge amount of standard flowers, which a part of it is said to be due to eating a large number of cheap foreign cotton. In short, from a practical point of view, the cotton market is higher than the yarn price.</p>

<h3>Grain, Periodical Powder and Wheat, Uniformly Declining</h3>
<p>After the opening of the powder market in the morning, each month consistently presented a state of collapse and no end. The quotation of foreign wheat was a little better in Chicago by 4 points, and there was no market in Canada. However, the atmosphere of the market, since the Japanese merchants sold foreign flour at the cheapest price in Dalian, it seems that the hearts of the majority of people will be stimulated, and due to the end of the year, most of the outsiders can’t help but end, so from this month to April, they have all broken the 1-corner mark, and it fell another 2 to 3 points from the previous day. This kind of situation is really unexpected. Then, because the market was too large, the short positions profitably replenished smoothly, and the market rebounded by 1 or 2 points. After the opening in the afternoon, this month, because it was close to the final transaction, the opening price fell, and then it was slightly better, and finally it still fell, the lowest to 2 yuan and 08 and a half points.

As a result, this month fell 1 point and 7 cents from the previous day, January was better by 5 cents and 2 cents, April was 2 cents and a half, and May was better by 5 cents.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month showed a falling phenomenon, the quotation of foreign wheat, little change, the hearts of the people, since less activity, only the selling price of the current foreign wheat, limited by the added tax, but the pricing agreement, in fact, after the added tax, there is little relationship, after which it has been decided that each will import, the needs of the flour mill, of course, will be based on foreign wheat, but the market will not be able to expand due to the gradual downturn in the flour market, and the market situation in each month, is also cannot expand. As a result, January fell by 7 cents from the previous day, February and March fell by 7 cents, and April fell by 6 cents. The existing wheat did not move due to the family, and there was no start of cloud.</p>

The appetite for thick japonica rice and Duyang pointed rice from various regional merchants in this area remained acceptable. However, the overall market condition was still difficult to show significant strength, with prices showing neither increase nor decrease. While there was active buying from those swapping old currency for silver and small-scale buyers, the market shape remained stable due to the lack of loosened selling pressure.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about forty boats arrived from various routes downriver. The off-take of various goods in the market remained sluggish.

<h3>Overview of the Daily Necessities Market (1)</h3>
<p>(Xi Nan)</p>
<p>Everyone in Shanghai knows that it is a major trading port, where all industries converge. From large import and export trade of tens of millions to small daily necessities, companies and firms are countless. It is difficult to have a statistics for that at this time. Let’s not talk about commercial research. Just about the shops for our daily needs, based on my experience, I will write it out for readers' reference. It can also be called "a fool's gain."</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the grain. Rice shops can be seen on every road. Rice shops also do "cut noodle" business, and some also do "horse feed", and also sell flour. Originally, rice shops purchased goods from rice firms using "sea bushels", but when they sold it, they used scales, calculating two hundred pounds of net rice as one "shi" [unit of measure], plus four pounds for the bag. However, the rice purchased, such as high-quality rice, weighs two hundred fifteen or sixteen pounds per "shi", and at least two hundred seven or eight pounds. This is the benefit of being a rice shop. Nowadays, rice firms use market bushels, and rice shops also use market scales, but if you ask them to use the old measurement, they can still do it, but the price will be higher.</p>
<p>Rice firms have two markets, north and south. The south market is on Dou Shi Street. Since the establishment of the new wharf on the outer road, rice firms have set up branch offices there for convenient unloading. Therefore, Dou Shi Street has only become the settlement place for the rice industry. The north market is on Guangfu Road, Zhabei, probably near the north bank of the Xinzha Bridge. They are all passed from rice-selling boatmen through distributors to rice firms, then sold by rice firms to rice shops, and then sold by rice shops to consumers. This is a general statement, but it already feels like there are many middlemen and complicated procedures. If we consider from the producer – the farmer – to the consumer, there are even more people involved in the transfer.</p>
<p>Beans, wheat, sesame, oil cakes, mung beans, and peanuts are collectively referred to as miscellaneous grains. Most of the firms in this group also do rice business, mostly located on Dou Shi Street. However, there are also many out-of-town merchants in the miscellaneous grain industry, mostly located near Aiguo Road and Minguo Road. Trading takes place in the morning at Cai Shu Tang on Dou Shi Street, and in the afternoon at the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Trade Association on Minguo Road, the futures are at the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange. As for the local oil factory trading, it takes place at the Oil Factory Trade Association. Flour mills are mostly located in western Shanghai Zhabei, near Suzhou River, for convenient loading and unloading of flour wheat. Their spot trading is at the Flour Trade Association, and futures are at the Flour Exchange.</p>
<p>In terms of eating, Shanghai is all kinds of things, nothing strange. But in general, eating simple meals often means going to the hotel alleys, now changed to mainland shopping malls. Hotel alleys have become historical terms. The side dishes in hotel alleys are famous for fried "quan zi" (pig intestines) and fried "juan cai" (fish maw filling), and payment is made in small foreign coins, which is relatively cheaper, so it is welcomed by general economical people. Before the construction of the Mainland Shopping Mall, Jiujiang Road from Zhili Road to Shandong Road almost held the authority of the restaurant industry. There was also one of the three so-called tavern industry associations at that time, Tai He Yuan. For celebratory business, it competed with Hong Yun Lou on Fada Road, both north and south. Between a certain time, this section of the road often felt crowded with traffic, making it inconvenient to walk.</p>
<p>The term "economic meal" has also become popular. But five or six years ago, although there were cheap meals with two pieces of salted pork, a bowl of tofu soup, and three bowls of white rice, they were not something that the general public could afford. At that time, Guangdong restaurants, apart from North Sichuan Road, mostly focused on supper snacks. Ten years ago, it cost two dimes [角，jiao] to eat a supper, and white rice could be eaten as much as you wanted without restriction. The side dishes could be chosen from the range of winter mushroom ducks, fried eggs, and fragrant sausages, etc., with two items ordered at the customer's convenience. Later, Guangdong restaurants developed day by day, and there is today's situation. The cost of supper is also several times higher than in the past.</p>
<p>The development of Guangdong restaurants is suspected to have a considerable relationship with the "revolution". Since Guangdong was the source of the revolution, revolutionary elements from all over traveled south. When the National Revolutionary Army marched north, the soldiers who were accustomed to the Southern flavor developed a close relationship with Guangdong side dishes. Therefore, Cantonese cuisine became popular in Shanghai, and people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang were greatly moved by the thought of the fearsome "Dragon Tiger Gate".</p>
<p>According to the author's memory, economic meals started at the Mei Nong Sichuan Cuisine Restaurant on Sanma Road, which was five dimes per person at that time. Later, it gradually spread to other restaurants. In recent years, vegetable rice and four-joy meat have become extremely popular. It is not necessary to say that the Dongxin Bridge area is the birthplace of rice and dishes. In other places, they compete with economic rice one after another. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>"Worshiping the Foreign" and "Obsessed with the Old"</h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with the status quo is likely human nature, and the progress of society can largely be attributed to the improvement driven by dissatisfaction with the status quo. However, Chinese people often do not act this way. Even when dissatisfied with the current state, they do not seek to improve it. Instead, they look for something to rely on to forget or despise reality.</p>
<p>To despise oneself, one worships Europe and America as much as possible. A casual remark or action by a Westerner is seen as magical and worthy of emulation. Sometimes, there is even worship, with the desire to be that foreigner. However, since that is obviously impossible, one has no choice but to settle for second best, intentionally or unintentionally seeing oneself or simply declaring oneself as a certain foreign person from the East, or a certain foreign person number two. In the film industry, in the arts, in politics, in every field, China has such talents. While in foreign countries, there are only a few in each country, China almost has the entire complement of every country.</p>
<p>But that is just to say worship, just to say imitation, and the imitation is almost such that one becomes the imitated, but that does not mean understanding. To say understanding is very difficult. Even in a trivial daily matter, many now have spring locks on their doors, but few seem to carry the key in their pockets, and they still have to call at the door when they get home, regardless of the trouble. They only know that what is foreign is good, but they often do not know what is good about it.</p>
<p>There is also a type of person who is dissatisfied with the status quo and retreats into the past. That retreat could be ten years, twenty years, one hundred years, or one thousand years. They see how good it was back then, how detached people were, how leisurely life was, how one could search for plum blossoms in the snow, how one could invite the moon for a drink. When they are really forced to the point where they can no longer bear it, they quote a line of poetry or a few sentences of prose from the ancients to whom their hearts are attached, in order to slightly relieve the pent-up feelings in their hearts.</p>
<p>The status quo can be forgotten, and the worship of the foreign and the obsession with the old are the two most straightforward ways to forget the status quo. The application of these two methods can be seen as very common from the fact that the two festivals that are currently accompanying us forward, Christmas and the New Year, are generally called "Christmas" and the "Gregorian" New Year. China also originally had a birthday that was called Christmas, but now, if you just say Christmas without naming it, it will definitely not refer to the Chinese one, but will certainly refer to the birthday of Jesus, regardless of whether you believe in his teachings. And when people say they are celebrating the Gregorian New Year, they are undoubtedly still waiting for the New Year - that is the authentic New Year, so it is not necessary to use the qualifier "lunar."</p>
<h3>On "Hidden Books"</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>"Apprentices gladly enter, writing is born from resentment," this is what I said ten years ago when I first read Tang Zhen's preface to "Hidden Books". What does "writing is born from resentment" mean? The ancient sages said, "The author of the Book of Changes must have had sorrows!" King Wen was imprisoned in Youli, and he wrote the Zhou Yi; the Yi was born from resentment. The Book of Songs says, "The gentleman makes a song, to express his sorrow." The Minor Odes have many resentful poems; poetry is born from resentment. Qu Yuan's "Li Sao" and Sima Qian's "Historical Records" were also born from resentment. Reading Sima Qian's autobiography, we can know that the so-called sages of ancient times, who left behind writings to express themselves, were all works inspired by anger and entrusted with meaning. This is where my saying that "writing is born from resentment" comes from.</p>
<p>As for Tang Zhen, he was a county magistrate who could not fulfill his ambitions. After resigning from office, he rented a house in the city of Wu, with only three or four rooms and bare walls. The smoke from his cooking stove often disappeared, and he would pick wolfberry leaves from discarded paintings to eat as food. Dressed in rags, he was content and happy, writing continuously. Initially, he called his book "Heng Shu," intending to weigh the world, but later, because of repeated setbacks, he renamed it "Hidden Books." In his "Great Command" chapter, he bitterly criticized the phenomena of unequal distribution of wealth and unequal happiness and suffering, even saying that all the chaos in the world arises from this. Only someone who has been hungry himself and does not want others to be hungry can have these profound and clear words. His "Reverence" and "Room Words" chapters bitterly denounced the crimes of despotism. Only someone who deeply hated the tyrants and traitors of the time and thoroughly understood that all the so-called sage emperors and virtuous kings were nothing more than that can have these insightful and pertinent words. In his "Room Words" chapter, he roughly stated that all emperors since the Qin Dynasty were thieves. Suppose someone is carrying several bolts of cloth and several bushels of grain on the road, and someone kills him and takes his cloth and grain. Is that a thief or not? Killing one person to take his cloth and grain is still called a thief, but killing all the people in the world and taking all their wealth is not called a thief? After the Three Dynasties, no one who gained the world was as good as the Han Dynasty, but Emperor Gao of Han massacred the cities of Chengyang and Yingyang, and Emperor Guangwu massacred three hundred cities. Encountering a village, he would destroy it; passing a market, he would disperse it; entering a city, he would massacre it. What was this for? The people died in war, and those who died because of war were fifteen or sixteen out of ten. The exposed bones were not yet collected, and the cries were not yet silenced. Then he would put on his robes, ride in his legal chariot, sit in the front hall, receive congratulations, build high palaces, and expand gardens to enrich his wives and concubines and fatten his sons and grandsons. What was his heart that he could bear to enjoy this? If God were to put me in charge of cases involving murder, I would know how to deal with them. Tang Zhen lived during the late Ming Dynasty, witnessing the changes in political power and the horrors of massacres and chaos. He once served in a new dynasty of a different ethnicity, but was submerged in a low position and could not reach the top, unable to express his talents and ambitions. Therefore, his resentful feelings were expressed in his writings, and he was unaware of the turmoil in his heart and the disturbance of his pen. Moreover, at that time, the Aisin Gioro clan had just entered China and was trying to impose a cruel government to intimidate the Chinese people. The Chinese people, under the oppression of violence, could do nothing for a while. Therefore, clever scholars sang praises of the status quo every day to please the barbarian dynasty and sought wealth and comfort for themselves. Those who were upright and self-respecting could only escape the status quo and retreat to the mountains and waters. Tang Zhen lived at that time. He could neither sing praises of the status quo and associate himself with the shameless, nor could he escape the status quo and call himself a remnant of the previous dynasty. In the beginning, he aspired to transform the status quo and intended to write "Heng Shu". In the end, he attacked the status quo with anger, and "Hidden Books" was completed. That is why I say his writing was born from resentment.</p>
<p>What does "learning from pleasure" mean? Tang's ability to endure hunger and cold and happily engage in writing has already been mentioned. In the "Pleasure Entry" chapter of "Hidden Books," he says, "The ancients had many methods of teaching, but I have not heard of teaching people with pleasure. Why do I enter through this? I am from Sichuan, and my nature is like its mountains and rivers, unable to tolerate turbulence, and I am always full of worries and anger. After careful observation, the root of my illness is that I am harmed by displeasure. Pleasure is my door, not the door of the masses." He also believed that without pleasure, one would often harbor annoyance, see much injustice, and see much irrationality. Therefore, all blaming of Heaven and others, and all lack of love, arise from this. Pleasure is the opposite. From this point of view, Tang's so-called pleasure is actually the pleasure of displeasure, born out of the helplessness of his situation and the words of a heartbroken man. Could he really be happy and pleased with himself? If he was happy and pleased with himself, and had no resentment, then there would be no need for him to write with anger, and "Hidden Books" would not have been written.</p>
<h3>On the Bridge</h3>
<p>— He Jiahua</p>
<p>On the bridge in Tanziwan, under the stone railing on the left, there is a peanut seller.</p>
<p>Except for rainy or snowy days when he has to carry an umbrella and a bamboo basket, running around selling, he sits under that stone railing, spreading old newspapers on the ground, dividing the peanuts into piles, waiting for customers.</p>
<p>He is very dull and doesn't know how to drum up business. He sits there all day, not even shouting a few times, just like a bodhisattva who doesn't speak.</p>
<p>"Three coppers for ten!"</p>
<p>When he sees someone walking by, he moves his lips, but only he can hear what he says. The peanuts he sells are not expensive, but here, even eating peanuts seems to be an extravagant pastime. Because business is slow, he is bored sitting there, constantly dividing the peanuts into piles, some with six, some with eight, and some with ten. Some days, he brings hundreds of peanuts from home, dividing them all day until evening, and not a single peanut is missing.</p>
<p>The area nearby is full of Jiangbei people who are so poor that they can't even afford to eat. They swarm like ants in small boats on the river, transporting manure, coal, and straw paper all day long, without a moment to spare. Their pigeon coops are next to the railway, with thatched roofs and yellow mud walls, swaying in the wind. When the train flies by, those thatched roofs are covered in a layer of dust. The housewives of these thatched huts have all left their families to work in factories. Their children are digging for coal cinders, carrying waste paper, and collecting broken bottles and pipes on the streets. Even though they are still little boys wearing red pants, they cannot be underestimated in their work.</p>
<p>The squalor here is especially shocking. The bridges, streets, and highways are filled with buses and jitneys speeding by all day long, raising clouds of dust. The small river evaporates a foul odor. In the distance, on that desolate wasteland, you can see countless open-air toilets, countless bottoms facing the sky, defecating there.</p>
<p>"Three coppers for ten!"</p>
<p>Sometimes he shouts louder, hoping to earn a few more coppers, but it is in vain. He has also reduced the price, selling twelve peanuts for three coppers, or twenty-four for just five coppers, but the people who pass by just look, shake their heads, as if these few coins are also a burden they cannot bear. They are all poor, miserable, and busy. It is rare for anyone to have a few coppers in their pockets and have the leisure to stand on the bridge, peel peanut shells, remove peanut skins, and eat peanut kernels.</p>
<p>The peanut seller sits there all day, like a bodhisattva who doesn't speak. Sometimes he gets bored and tries to chat with people:</p>
<p>"I really don't understand why there's no business!"</p>
<p>"It's natural not to eat peanuts, but it would be strange if no one got a haircut!"</p>
<p>The one who answers is a boy with a small braid on his head and a steel earring on his ear. Early in the morning, he brought a wooden frame with a washbasin, along with the razor and ear brush he inherited from his father, to the bridge to give haircuts. Business is also very slow.</p>
<p>"Haircuts? Humph, these Jiangbei people don't necessarily need that! They only get haircuts a few times a year. They won't think about getting a 'taro' (haircut) until their hair is like a 'long hair', and there are too many people doing your kind of business!"</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many barbers. Everywhere you can see wooden frames with washbasins, next to which sit people just as greasy, ragged, and covered in hair as this boy.</p>
<p>"Then even fewer people will eat your peanuts."</p>
<p>"It seems…but not necessarily…"</p>
<p>Hearing their conversation, a shoemaker who always has his sleeves rolled up, sitting on a leather stool not far away, suddenly interjects:</p>
<p>"Few people come to me to mend shoes either."</p>
<p>"That's for sure—" the peanut seller says sadly, "There aren't many Jiangbei people here who can afford shoes at all!"</p>
<p>"But…"</p>
<p>The shoemaker wants to say more, but seeing their sad faces, he has to remain silent. In fact, he also understands that in this slum, not only eating peanuts, but also getting haircuts and mending shoes seem unnecessary, wasteful expenses that can be cut.</p>
<h3>Book Talk (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Junzhi</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>In the "Tender Nest Notes," there is another story about a book lover, which reads: "Shaoshi Mountain Room Brush Collection: Zhang Wenqian's Keshan Collection of one hundred volumes. I saw a manuscript in a remote alley in Lin'an, with strange and ancient seals and elegant decorations. I was pleasantly surprised, but I had no money with me at the time. I looked around and found two pieces of green silk in my bag, and also took off the black silk straight gown and the half-sleeved blue Shu brocade I was wearing, and gave them all in exchange. The seller was distressed that he could not sell the book, and was overjoyed to get the price, so we agreed to meet the next morning. I returned to my residence and could not sleep all night. I visited him before washing my face and combing my hair in the morning, but found that a fire had spread from a neighbor's house the night before. This book was suddenly burned to ashes. To see a rare book and be willing to take off one's clothes, and even to be unable to sleep all night, can be said to be the ultimate in devotion to books. Unexpectedly, the god of fire played a prank and took it away in the night. How巧巧巧巧巧巧巧巧妙!?"</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Huang Shangu said, "If a scholar does not read for three days, he feels that his language is tasteless, and even his face is hateful when he looks in the mirror." Mi Yuanzhang said, "If I don't read for a day, I feel my thoughts are dull." The book lover and the book are truly like air, which cannot be separated for a moment. And reading, in the eyes of the book lover, is not only to increase literary cultivation, but also an extremely beautiful painting, an extremely elegant life, as Chen Meigong's "Increased and Decreased Washing Brook Sand" says:</p>
<p>The fragrance of catalpa blossoms in the half-moonlight, the sound of oars returns as cicadas chirp, the curved willow bay with low thatched huts, hanging fish. Pointing and laughing at where my house is? A pond of lotus leaves, a small bridge across. Lamp light through paper windows in bamboo thickets, the sound of reading (see "Dwelling in Seclusion").</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (72)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Wei Ke</p>
<p>She hugged him tightly and cried again: then she pressed her face against Zhan's face and continued, "Okay, but Bi'er? How can we be together with him!"</p>
<p>Zhan said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"We can always think of a way. You can no longer live with him."</p>
<p>The thought of her older son made her convulse in pain.</p>
<p>"No, I can't live with him anymore, can't! can not!"</p>
<p>She then threw herself into Zhan's arms, crying out as if she were facing a crisis in her mental state:</p>
<p>"Save me from him, my little baby, save me, think of a way, I don't know... look for it! Save me!"</p>
<p>"Okay, Mom, I'll think of a way."</p>
<p>"Immediately...it has to be immediately...you don't leave me! I'm afraid of him...I'm so scared!"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll find a way. I promise you."</p>
<p>"Ah! But hurry, hurry! You really don't know what kind of feeling I have when I see him."</p>
<p>Then she whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>"Leave me here, leave me in your house."</p>
<p>He hesitated, thought about it with his precise mind, and he understood the danger of leaving his mother there.</p>
<p>But he had to explain to her for a long, long time, arguing with her, using clear arguments to overcome her frenzy and terror.</p>
<p>"Just leave me for one night," she said, "just leave me for tonight. Tomorrow you can tell Roland that I didn't come back because I was sick."</p>
<p>"That's impossible, because Bi'er has already returned. Come on, be brave. I will sort everything out tomorrow. I will be back home at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. Come on, put on your hat, I'll take you back."</p>
<p>"I'll do whatever you want," she said with a childlike attitude of fear and grateful faith.</p>
<p>She tried to get up; but the blow she had suffered was too great; she could not stand on her own legs.</p>
<p>So he gave her some sugar water, called for some alkali, and wiped her temples with vinegar. Like a woman after childbirth, she let him serve her.</p>
<p>He was finally able to walk, and she took his arm. As they passed the city hall, the clock was striking three.</p>
<p>In front of their residence, he embraced and kissed her, and said to her: "Goodbye, Mom, please be brave."</p>
<p>She secretly climbed the silent stairs, entered her bedroom, quickly took off her clothes, and, with the kind of feeling of excitement after a secret rendezvous, slipped in beside Roland, who was snoring.</p>
<p>In that house, only Bi'er was not asleep; he heard her return.</p>

<p>Special Publication for the Opening of the Entire Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway (Inscription by Lu Diping)</p>
<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Zeng Yangfu</p>
<p>Premier Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China" places railway construction as the backbone of all development plans. For the past five or six years, national affairs have been turbulent. The government and the public have been unable to actively construct this main railway line. All patriots in the country consider this a matter of regret. Now, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, only 350 kilometers long, has been completed, attracting the attention of Chinese and foreigners. The press has specially published a special issue to promote it during the opening ceremony. This is certainly not to show special favor to this short, light-rail railway. Rather, it is because a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and a massive vehicle starts from a simple wheel. The high expectations reflect the heavy responsibilities placed upon it! We, the undersigned, are aware that today's achievements fall short of the expectations of our predecessors and society. However, we dare not conceal the three or four years of dedication and loyalty, nor the significant meaning of the construction of this railway. We must share it with the public.</p>
<p>Railways are the lifeline of transportation. They play a crucial role in promoting politics, regulating the economy, developing resources, and improving culture. When constructing railways today, it is necessary to consider the local financial strength, align with economic principles, meet social needs, and strive to embody the spirit of "doing everything possible quickly" advocated by contemporary talents. The construction funds for the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway did not come from loans alone; they were also raised from the people. If from loans, the cost must be minimized; if from the people, the burden must be as light as possible. Therefore, lightweight materials were used as much as possible, and all equipment was kept simple. This is not deliberately falling behind; it is because construction in China cannot proceed without doing everything possible. The purpose of building the railway is to facilitate transportation, and the railway itself must also be profitable. The section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway from the riverside to Lanxi took only two years to complete despite the many difficulties at the beginning. The section from Jinhua to Yushan was completed in just one year of rush construction. This is not a hasty approach. Rather, it is because railway construction must be done quickly to meet the needs of society. However, the significance of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway goes beyond this.</p>
<p>China's construction today involves numerous aspects, far beyond the government's financial capacity. Moreover, society, accustomed to past failures of state-owned enterprises, lacks firm faith. Despite feeling an overabundance of capital, they dare not boldly invest in construction projects. This is a major reason why China's construction cannot proceed actively. However, the construction funds for the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway came from social investment, nearly half of the total. This created a new impression. In the future, the people can promote this spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, enabling all construction projects to proceed simultaneously, leading China to prosperity and strength. The significance is immense!</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to China's vast territory and the obstruction of high mountains and great rivers, different regions have developed their own customs, making it difficult to achieve complete unity and solidarity. The completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is sufficient to solve the transportation difficulties of Zhejiang Province, but its northern end only starts at the opposite bank of Hangzhou, and its southern end only reaches Yushan in Jiangxi, neither of which connects with other railways. Its impact is limited to a small area. Looking at the national railway construction situation, the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) line is under active construction, but the completion of the Wuhan Railway Bridge is still uncertain. The natural barrier of the Yangtze River inspires only sighs of despair. The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line directly connects the north via the capital's ferry service, but the Qiantang River's tides pose a natural barrier to the east and west. To see a thousand miles, one must climb to a higher level! Fortunately, the construction of the Yushan-Pingxiang Railway is scheduled to begin, and the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge has also been planned. If we can promote the spirit of supporting the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, with cooperation from the government and the public, then in the future, the Yushan-Pingxiang line can connect with the Yuehan Railway, and the Qiantang River Bridge can connect Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou and reach Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai. The northernmost border regions and the southernmost Guangdong will be connected, with goods transported in all directions. People from all regions will become one family. Once barriers are removed and autonomy is achieved, this small, 350-kilometer light-rail railway will have a great impact on the Republic of China and will contribute to the completion of the Premier's entire industrial plan. The excessive praise from society today has significant meaning! I, Yangfu, am unworthy, but I have followed in the footsteps of wise men, participated in this project, and strived to complete it, bringing me great honor. Therefore, I express my feelings at this moment.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Jinhua River Bridge</h3>
<h3>Railway History</h3>
<p>— Du Zhenyuan</p>
<p>Development</p>
<p>Inception: Zhejiang Province's deliberations on railway management began in 1927. At that time, the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition pacified Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Mr. Zhang Jingjiang was ordered to preside over Zhejiang's administration. Recognizing that transportation in Zhejiang was limited by the mountainous terrain, he instructed the Construction Department to send personnel to survey the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Zhejiang-Anhui routes, planning to build narrow-gauge light railways. With Mr. Zhang's departure from Zhejiang, the plan was shelved. In the winter of 1928, Mr. Zhang became the Director of the Construction Committee and concurrently administered Zhejiang. In December of that year, he telegraphed Zhenyuan to come to Zhejiang to re-survey the previously measured Zhejiang-Jiangxi route, starting from Zhakou in Hangzhou, following the left bank of the Qiantang River, passing through Fuyang, Tonglu, Jiande, Lanxi, Longyou, Qu County, and ending at Jiangshan, extending to Yushan in Jiangxi for communication. The entire route was approximately 317 kilometers long, surveyed over two months. On February 8, 1929, it was submitted to the 203rd meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee, which resolved to build a railway according to the standard gauge, named the Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway.</p>
<p>Preparation: On February 25, 1929, the 207th meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee approved the organizational outline of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Preparatory Office, appointing Zhenyuan as the director of the Preparatory Office. On March 1, the Preparatory Office was established, forming four survey teams to conduct preliminary and detailed surveys of the entire line in sections. On May 29, the Provincial Government Committee resolved that the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Preparatory Office should be dissolved by the end of May, and an Engineering Bureau should be reorganized to commence planning for the railway project, appointing Zhenyuan as the Director and Chief Engineer of the Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Engineering Bureau. On June 1, the Engineering Bureau was established. By July 29, the preliminary and detailed surveys by the survey teams were completed and submitted to the Bureau for mapmaking. At this time, the Provincial Government, due to the lack of construction funds for the railway, planned to issue 10 million yuan of Zhejiang Provincial Construction Bonds, designating 6.26 million yuan of these bonds for the construction of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. Although this was approved by the Central Government, the large amount of debt made it difficult to raise funds quickly, leading to a standstill.</p>
<p>Route Change: On December 10 of the same year, an order was received from the Provincial Government, instructing the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Engineering Bureau to avoid the original personnel and manage the Xiaoshan-Changshan Highway project, transferring part of the funds allocated for railway construction to the construction of the Xiaoshan-Changshan Highway. In this situation, although the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Engineering Bureau was not abolished in name, the actual construction was hopeless. Unexpectedly, the Construction Department proposed that the Xiaoshan-Changshan Highway was longer, passed through densely populated areas, and had abundant products. In addition to passenger transport, freight transport should also be considered. The highway could not bear the heavy burden of long-distance transport. It was proposed to follow this line, still using standard gauge, and replace it with a light railway to build the Xiaoshan-Changshan Light Railway, saving financial resources while gradually developing. This was approved by the Provincial Government Committee, and construction was to begin immediately. However, this line and the previously determined Hangzhou-Jiangshan route followed the same direction, with the only difference being that the Hangzhou-Jiangshan line followed the left bank of the river, while the Xiaoshan-Changshan line followed the right bank. Now that the right bank was being followed, the terrain between Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu, and Jinhua was flat and easy to construct. To implement the initial plan to connect to eastern Jiangxi, the northern section of the original Xiaoshan-Changshan route was extended to the opposite bank of Hangzhou, starting from the riverside, passing through Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, crossing the Jinhua River, and changing to pass through Tangxi to reach Longyou. From Longyou westward, because there were commercially operated automobile roads between Quzhou, Changshan, and Yushan, and the mountains between Changshan and Yushan were steep, making construction difficult, it was decided to continue using the previously surveyed left bank section from Qu County to Jiangshan and extending to Yushan to save costs and avoid competition. This became the main line of the railway, with a length of 336 kilometers. A branch line was built from Jinhua to Lanxi, the Jinhua-Lanxi branch line, with a length of approximately 24 kilometers. After this change, the railway was no longer limited to Xiaoshan and Changshan as the beginning and end points. It was still called the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to match the name with reality.</p>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p>Jiangshan-Lanxi Section: With the route of the railway determined, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 9, 1930. The section of the route between Xixing Riverside and Lanxi was divided into two main sections and six sub-sections, and construction began simultaneously. On December 14, track laying began between the riverside and Zhuji. Due to financial difficulties in the province, construction funds were insufficient, and orders were given to gradually advance each project in stages, slowing down the progress. After May 1931, the Provincial Government signed a loan contract with four Hangzhou banks, allowing work to be done more freely. On June 1, the railway was opened to traffic to Jianshan, and on July 1 to Zhuji. On October 1, track laying began again beyond Zhuji, and the railway was opened to traffic station by station as construction progressed. On March 6, 1932, the railway was opened to traffic to Lanxi. The Jiangshan-Lanxi section of the project was completed, entering the operational period. This section of the route was 195 kilometers long, and from the start of construction to completion, it took two years.</p>
<p>Jinhua-Yushan Section: The Jinhua-Yushan section of the project was supported by the Ministry and Council, which allocated Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds for the purchase of foreign materials. The Provincial Government also obtained the consent of four Hangzhou banks to continue borrowing funds to complete the construction of the entire railway. On September 1, 1932, the detailed survey of the Jinhua-Yushan section of the route began, and a bridge survey team was formed to investigate the bridge sites along the line. After about two months, the survey was completed. To facilitate supervision, the section was divided into two main sections and eight sub-sections, and tenders were invited to construct the roadbed earthwork and stonework simultaneously. Construction began in November and December. Because the section had more large bridges than the Jiangshan-Lanxi section, the Jinhua River Bridge, in a crucial location, was the largest project and was tendered early, starting construction on December 20. Other bridges, large and small, were designed separately, and contractors were invited to build them, or the Bureau hired workers to do the work themselves. This section of the route was 165 kilometers long. Because the construction funds were raised at once, the project progressed rapidly. Track laying began in sections in July and August, reaching Jiangshan in early October. The railway was opened to traffic to Longyou on October 10, Qu County on November 1, and track laying reached Yushan on November 28, completing the entire line. From the start of construction to the present, it took only one year.</p>
<h3>Capital</h3>
<p>The entire railway was built in two phases. The funds raised by the Provincial Department and allocated as construction capital for the railway also came from different sources. The capital expenditures for the Jiangshan-Lanxi section and the Jinhua-Yushan section are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Jiangshan-Lanxi Section: This section of the route is 195 kilometers long. The actual construction cost was 6,939,516.43 yuan. The principal and interest repaid to the banking group was 316,244.25 yuan. The total capital income for both items was 7,255,760.68 yuan. Of this, 3.6 million yuan was allocated from loans twice from four Hangzhou banks (China, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Local, and China Agricultural and Industrial) with construction bond certificates and other items as collateral. 3,534,983.87 yuan was raised by the Provincial Department itself. The remaining 120,000 yuan was deducted by the banking group from the renewed loan for the construction of the Jinhua-Yushan section.</p>
<p>(2) Jinhua-Yushan Section: This section of the route is 165 kilometers long. The estimated construction cost was approximately 6.11 million yuan, divided into two categories: foreign material costs and domestic construction costs. The former was allocated 200,000 pounds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity. As of the end of June 1933, only 140,000 pounds of foreign materials had been purchased, equivalent to approximately 2.2 million yuan. The remaining 60,000 pounds was planned to be reserved for future expansion of equipment and was not included in the construction cost for this period. Due to limited funding sources, the latter was also estimated in two parts. Essential projects and equipment to maintain traffic were classified as the first part, requiring more than 3.56 million yuan. Projects related to increasing traffic safety and maintaining initial operations, which needed to be built as soon as traffic opened, were classified as the second part, requiring more than 340,000 yuan. The expenditure of this 340,000+ yuan was planned to be allocated monthly from operating income after traffic opened, saving initial construction capital. The domestic construction cost of the first part, 3.56 million+ yuan, was supplemented by the Provincial Government renewing the loan of 2.5 million yuan from the four Hangzhou banks that had previously provided the loan. The remaining amount was allocated from the surplus obtained from the sale of the Hangzhou Power Plant. The exact amount of capital expenditure for this section will be determined after the construction accounts are closed.</p>
<h3>Operation</h3>
<p>The Jiangshan-Lanxi section of the railway began handling passenger and freight transport on June 1, 1931, when traffic opened from Xixing Riverside to Jianshan. However, the operating equipment was not yet perfect, and</p>

<h3>Engineering Report</h3>
<p>— Du Zhenyuan</p>
<p>Plan</p>
<p>The purpose of the railway's operation is to connect Zhejiang Province, and the route it passes through is originally a section of the southeastern railway system trunk line set by Dr. Sun Yat-sen: in the future, it can be extended to the major eastern ports and to Nanchang to connect the South China Sea Railway, and then to Pingxiang to connect with the Yuehan Railway. It can then directly reach Guangzhou. The importance of its location is evident. All engineering plans should be handled in accordance with the standards set by the Ministry to ensure long-term development. However, the railway's construction capital is raised by the Zhejiang Provincial Government itself. Due to financial constraints, it is impossible to carry out large-scale projects immediately. After careful consideration of the economic situation in eastern Zhejiang, there is currently no large amount of transport. Therefore, after studying the situation and adapting to local conditions, it was decided to adopt a light-rail wide-gauge plan to save initial construction capital. However, all designs have reserved space for improvement so that heavier rails can be replaced and heavier locomotives can be used in the future as the business develops. The railway's engineering plan is described in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) Steel Rails and Fittings: The railway's steel rails are 33 pounds per yard in weight. The length and cross-section, as well as the size of the rail spikes, are all handled in accordance with the regulations of the American Society of Civil Engineers. However, the fishplates and bolt holes are designed separately to increase the load on the track. The fishplates are 508 mm (20 inches) long, which is 98 mm (3 7/8 inches) longer than the original regulations. The center distance of the bolt holes is increased by 25 mm (1 inch) each, totaling 127 mm (5 inches), to be suitable for the suspended joint method.</p>
<p>(2) Track Gauge: The standard track gauge is still used to facilitate the replacement of heavier rails. The current cost is limited, and the benefits of future improvements are great.</p>
<p>(3) Rail Joint Method: The railway's roadbed is newly built, and the ballast is not fully laid. Rail joints are inevitably subject to subsidence from time to time. Therefore, the square joint method is used to prevent the track from becoming an extremely complex wave shape and to ensure smooth driving.</p>
<p>(4) Rail Sleepers: The sleepers are made of 150 mm (6 inches) square and 2440 mm (8 feet) long pine wood, with 14 sleepers laid per whole rail (9144 mm, i.e., 30 feet long). Initially, it was planned to use domestic products as much as possible. However, the local production was not abundant and could not be fully supplied. It was necessary to use foreign pine to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>(5) Ballast: The railway's ballast requires 825 cubic meters per kilometer. The thickness below the sleepers is 200 mm (8 inches). The method of collecting materials is to open mountains along the line to collect ballast, or to pick up sand and ballast in nearby streams and rivers, or to select streams and rivers along the line with a large amount of pebbles, lay temporary branch lines to the shore to transport them, all using local materials to save costs and avoid waste.</p>
<p>(6) Roadbed: The soil quality along the railway is good. Therefore, the side slope of the embankment is generally set at a slope of 2:3. The width of the embankment varies depending on the height of the embankment. The width of the cut is uniformly 4 meters, with drainage ditches left on both sides for drainage. If the height of the cut and fill soil is more than 6 meters, a 1-meter wide bridle path is added in the middle of the side slope to prevent the side slope from collapsing and to protect the safety of the railway. As for the slope of the cut, it is determined differently depending on the geology: 1:1 for soil, 2:1 for soft rock, and 4:1 for hard rock. In addition, 2 to 4 meters of bridle paths are left under the foot of the slopes on both sides of the roadbed so that when the roadbed is widened in the future, there will still be appropriate bridle paths without repeated filling and excavation.</p>
<p>(7) Bridges: The railway's bridges are divided into three types: permanent, semi-permanent, and temporary construction, adapting to local conditions and considering the urgency, for economic facilities. Permanent bridges are mostly steel beam bridges, followed by concrete arch bridges, all designed according to the standard load set by the Ministry. Occasionally, the upper steel beams are temporarily designed according to Cooper's E35 load. Cover plates can be added at any time to increase the load-bearing capacity in the future. Semi-permanent bridges use concrete construction for the bridge seats and piers, also designed according to the permanent load-bearing capacity, while the upper structure is designed according to Cooper's E20 load. Old steel beams from the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway are used, or wooden pile piers are temporarily added between the pier seats, with wooden beams erected on them, to facilitate future reconstruction. Temporary buildings are all wooden bridges, with the bridge seats and piers designed according to Cooper's E35 load, and the upper structure designed according to Cooper's E20 load. Wooden beams can also be added at any time to increase the load-bearing capacity.</p>
<p>(8) Track: The maximum curvature radius of the track is generally set at 300 meters. However, in special circumstances, to avoid large-scale projects, a smaller radius can be used, but it must not be less than 250 meters. The maximum slope, including the slope reduction force on the curve, is set at 1%. The superelevation of other curves and the design of sturdy curves, as well as the shortest limit of straight lines, are all handled in accordance with the standards of state-owned railways set by the Ministry.</p>
<p>(9) Station Facilities: The facilities of each station are based on the principle of simplicity and applicability to reduce initial construction costs. When the railway first opened, sleepers were used to build houses, or private houses were rented, or the most economical temporary houses were built as station buildings, or temples were temporarily borrowed as temporary ticket sales locations. However, efforts were made to build proper water supply and locomotive and passenger car houses, as well as platforms and rain sheds for the convenience of passengers.</p>
<p>(10) Locomotives and Vehicles: The choice of locomotives is based on the maximum traction force suitable for the railway's track. Freight cars use 15-ton capacity cars, and passenger cars focus on the equipment of third-class cars to ensure comfort and perfection. It is also planned to add third-class sleeper cars after the entire railway is open to meet the needs of long-distance passengers.</p>
<p>(11) Signals: At the beginning of the railway's operation, there were not many trains. Due to construction costs, train operations are temporarily notified by telephone and telegraph, with simple flags used as signals for trains entering and leaving the station. Now that business is gradually developing, in 1933, distant and near semaphore signals and departure semaphore signals will be added to each station in the Jiangshan-Lanxi section to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Jinyun-Lishui Road Matoushan Quarrying Work</h3>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>With the plan determined and the project implemented, except for steel rails, sleepers, locomotives, and passenger and freight car chassis, which must be purchased from abroad, the railway directly orders from foreign countries to avoid contractors from profiting from it. The remaining most of the projects are contracted out to facilitate simplicity. And for handling and supervising</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway</h3>
<p>For ease of guidance, the Jiangshan-Lanxi section was divided into two main sections during construction, each with three sub-sections. Each sub-section was responsible for about thirty kilometers of track. The heads of the main and sub-sections were stationed within their respective jurisdictions to facilitate close supervision. After the completion of this section, the two main sections were merged into the first main section, and the sub-section system was abolished, with four work zones established to specialize in track maintenance. During the construction of the Jinhua-Yushan section, it was divided into the second and third main sections, each with four sub-sections, each responsible for approximately twenty kilometers. The general situation of the railway's engineering facilities is described below by category:</p>
<p>(1) Roadbed Construction: The contracting of roadbed earthwork and stonework projects was classified according to the nature of the soil and rock and the elevation, with unit prices as the standard, and the price was given after calculating the volume upon completion. The first bidding for the Jiangshan-Lanxi section was for the Jiangbian-Jianshan and Jianshan-Zhuji sub-sections. The second bidding was for the Zhuji-Suixi, Suixi-Yiwu, Yiwu-Jinhua, and Jinhua-Lanxi sub-sections. Xinmin Company contracted for the Jiangbian-Jianshan section, totaling approximately 220,000 cubic meters of earthwork and stonework. Datong Company contracted for the Jianshan-Zhuji section, totaling approximately 510,000 cubic meters of earthwork and stonework. Above Zhuji, a negotiated price method was adopted, and more than ten companies, including Daxing, Jinji, Zhao Chunji, Xiehe, and Yunsheng, were commissioned to do the work. The Jinhua-Yushan section was 164 kilometers long, with approximately 3.2 million cubic meters of earthwork and stonework. It was divided into eight sub-sections: Jinhua-Qianli, Qianli-Huzhen, Huzhen-Longyou, Longyou-Dongji, Dongji-Erlishijie, Erlishijie-Jiangshan, Jiangshan-Xintangbian, and Xintangbian-Yushan. Bids were invited for construction simultaneously, and contracts were signed immediately. Construction began successively in the winter of the 21st year and was completed successively in the autumn of this year. The progress of the project was much smoother than that of the Jiangshan-Lanxi section.</p>
<p>(2) Bridges and Culverts: Bidding for the bridges in the Jiangshan-Lanxi section eventually resulted in negotiated prices, and the construction was contracted to Yuqingchang, Shengzhongnan, Dongxing, Gengwu, and other companies separately. Construction began in May of the 19th year and continued, with all large and small bridges completed successively in the winter of the 20th year. There were a total of 100 bridges, including six iron bridges. Except for the wooden pile piers under the Jianshan River Bridge, which were temporary, the rest were concrete bridge abutments, with a total length of 177 meters and a total price of over 90,000 yuan. There were also 18 large and small concrete arch bridges, with a total length of 118 meters and a total price of over 160,000 yuan. There were also 76 large and small wooden bridges, with a total length of 1,217 meters and a total price of over 510,000 yuan. For the Jinhua-Yushan section's bridges and culverts, bidding was easier. Except for the culverts, which were installed by internal labor, the rest were contracted by selecting bidders through open bidding. There were 12 large bridges with a total length of over 1,600 meters, and 41 small bridges with a total length of 378 meters, requiring approximately 1.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Tracks: Due to financial constraints, the track materials for the entire railway were purchased in three batches. The first batch of 80 kilometers was for laying the Jiangbian-Zhuji section. The second batch of 144 kilometers was for the Zhuji-Lanxi section. The third batch of 180 kilometers was for laying the Jinhua-Yushan section. Therefore, the track laying project was also carried out in three phases. Initially, in mid-December of the 19th year, track laying began from Xixing Jiangbian, done by internal labor, and it was not until June of the following year that the tracks reached Zhuji. In October of the same year, the second batch of materials arrived, and the roadbed and bridge work above Zhuji had also been largely completed. Therefore, track laying continued above Zhuji, and it reached Lanxi in March of the 21st year. For the third phase of track laying in the Jinhua-Yushan section, a contract system was adopted. It began in late May of this year, and by November 28, the tracks were laid to the Yushan terminus, completing the entire railway. The roadbed of this railway was newly built and not yet solid, so track laying and opening to traffic were carried out immediately, resulting in ballast sinking constantly and often being insufficient. Furthermore, there were fewer vehicles; in addition to passenger and freight transport, there were only two ballast trains. By the end of June of this year, the ballast laid on the Jiangshan-Lanxi section was less than half of the original plan. Later, with the start of track laying in the Jinhua-Yushan section, the ballast cars were converted to transport materials, and the ballast laying work was stopped. The ballast for the Jinhua-Yushan section is now being laid only in the soft areas of the roadbed, not yet covering the entire area. Fortunately, the soil quality of the roadbed is still good, and trains can run safely at reduced speeds. As for the cost of ballast laying, it is approximately 920 yuan per kilometer for the Jiangshan-Lanxi section, and it is still difficult to calculate for the Jinhua-Yushan section, which is still in progress.</p>
<p>(4) Station Facilities: There are a total of 34 stations on the entire railway, including main and branch lines. In addition, Jingjiang Station was set up six kilometers west of Jiangbian Station, and Zhakou Station was set up on the opposite bank of Jingjiang Station to facilitate freight transport. A business station was set up at Sanlangmiao on the opposite bank of Jiangbian to facilitate passengers. The longest distance between stations is 27.5 kilometers, and the shortest is 5 kilometers. The grade of each station is determined based on the local population, products, and traffic conditions. Jiangbian is the starting point of the railway, with more frequent business. Jinhua is located in the middle of the entire line, at the beginning of the Jin-Lan branch line, and has the Jin-Wu-Yong-Jin highway for connection. Yushan is the terminus of the railway and a gathering area for the transfer of products from Zhejiang and Jiangxi. Therefore, their stations are all ranked first class. Linpu, Zhuji, Lanxi, Longyou, Quzhou, Jiangshan, and Hecun are either county towns, important towns, or places with abundant products, so they are all classified as second-class stations. The rest are classified as third or fourth-class stations, depending on local conditions. All construction at each station is simplified as much as possible due to financial constraints, focusing on practicality and avoiding extravagance, using local materials for design, or even renting civilian houses and temples as offices, as long as they are suitable for use, without hindering traffic safety or passenger convenience.</p>
<p>(5) Telegraph and Telephone: This project plans to use three pairs of No. 12 hard steel telephone wires and one iron telegraph wire. Due to the expense, it was necessary to outsource some work. Therefore, it was not possible to install everything at once. The Hangzhou Line Bureau to Jiangbian was initially engaged to supplement materials and requested the provincial telephone bureau to hang two pairs of No. 12 steel wires. Construction began on March 1 of the 19th year and was completed at the end of April. Due to the water line, it passed through Guanjia Weir across the river to Zhangjiacun, all using the telephone bureau's poles and submarine cables, totaling 37 kilometers. Zhangjiacun to Jiangbian was self-built and erected, totaling 6 kilometers. In total, this section is 43 kilometers long. Later, due to the long-term moisture exposure of the water line, the sound transmission was poor, which was inconvenient for both the telephone bureau and the railway. Therefore, they jointly purchased a ten-core submarine cable, each using half, totaling 700 meters, and replaced the equipment in the spring of the 22nd year. However, the telegraph line in this section is still lacking. The Jiangbian-Lanxi telephone line was self-installed by the railway in June of the 19th year with two pairs of No. 12 hard copper wires, reaching Lanxi in January of the 20th year. After the opening of traffic to Jianshan in June, due to the urgency of telecommunications, a telegraph line was added, completed in February of the 21st year. At that time, the opening of traffic to Lanxi was approaching, so a separate train service telephone line (No. 12 hard copper wire) was set up. Therefore, the Jiangshan-Lanxi section, including the incoming line, is 198 kilometers long. Exchange rooms were set up in Jiangbian, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, and other places, with a total of 65 telephones and 8 telegraphs. The total cost of labor and materials was 210,164 yuan (including the Hangzhou General Bureau to Jiangbian and the extension line, totaling 241 kilometers), with an average cost of 872 yuan per kilometer. Between Jinhua and Yushan, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the project, relying on telephone communication, poles were erected along the route in February of this year before the electrical materials were fully prepared, and one No. 8 galvanized iron wire was hung. It reached Huyan in late April. Due to insufficient materials, it was temporarily ended. The work lasted only 70 days, completing 156 kilometers of the main line and 8 kilometers of the incoming line, totaling 164 kilometers, with a total cost of 29,014 yuan. Later, the materials purchased with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity arrived, and three pairs of telephone lines were continued to be hung in that section, which has recently been completed, and the previously hung iron wire was moved to be used as a telegraph line. The final settlement of all labor and material costs is currently being compiled.</p>
<p>(6) Locomotives and Rolling Stock: Domestically produced locomotives and rolling stock chassis are lacking and must be ordered from abroad. All projects such as riveting and car body assembly that can be done independently are designed and undertaken by the Xixing Machine Factory of the railway. However, the quantity is limited due to financial constraints, and only enough to meet current needs has been purchased. Currently in operation are nine locomotives, thirty passenger cars (with first, second, and third classes), and eighty freight cars (including covered wagons, open wagons, and flatcars). The speed of the locomotives is 50 kilometers per hour, with a maximum tractive force of 300 tons. Second and third-class passenger cars can accommodate 52 people, and freight cars have a load capacity of 15 tons each. The locomotives and rolling stock ordered with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity have arrived with fifty freight car chassis, which will be successively made into covered wagons, open wagons, flatcars, etc., to join the transport. In addition, six locomotives and twenty-four passenger car underframes have not yet arrived. In total, there are fifteen locomotives, fifty-four passenger cars, and one hundred and thirty freight cars. If business develops in the future and these are insufficient, more will be added to meet the needs.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The scale of this railway project is vast, and its planning and facilities are not limited to the brief description above. Due to space limitations, only the most important aspects are summarized in this report. Detailed records have been compiled separately by the railway into a book called "Engineering Records," which will be distributed to guests from all walks of life at the opening ceremony in Jinhua today, and sent to important construction agencies and academic groups across the country for guidance and suggestions for improvement. Now, the construction cost of this railway will be briefly explained as a summary:</p>
<p>The total length of the entire railway is approximately 360 kilometers. The total construction cost is yet to be finalized for the Jinhua-Yushan section, as the project has just been completed, and a full settlement will take time. However, the final settlement for the Jiangshan-Lanxi section was over 7.2 million yuan, and the budget for the Jinhua-Yushan section was over 6 million yuan, totaling approximately 13 million yuan. The average cost per kilometer, including general affairs expenses, is approximately 36,000 yuan, which is less than half of that of other railways. Although light rails are temporarily used due to financial reasons, they are sufficient to meet current transportation needs and are suitable for the preliminary development needs of China's economy. Therefore, since the establishment of this railway, railways such as the Yu-Ping Railway in Jiangxi, the Long-Zhang Railway in Fujian, the Tong-Pu Railway in Shanxi, and the Cheng-Yu Railway in Sichuan have all planned to follow suit, in order to be light and easy to implement, so that society can understand that railway construction is not difficult, and the psychological fear of it in the past can be changed. This is what this railway is proud of.</p>

<p>Business should be simplified. Therefore, with reference to the Ministry of Railways' General Rules for Passenger and Freight Transportation and considering the conditions of this railway, the Provisional Rules for Passenger and Freight Transportation of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway in Zhejiang Province were drafted. Passenger transport initially only handled passenger and baggage transport, and freight transport was limited to cash payments. When the Jiangshan-Lanxi section was completed and opened to traffic in March of the 21st year, transportation of packages, livestock, vehicle bridges, currency, etc., was added from July 1st. From August 1st, handling of freight shipments with payment upon arrival began, and mail was carried from August 30th. On October 1st, passenger intermodal transport began with the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. By April of the 22nd year, the Jiangshan-Lanxi section had been open to traffic for a full year. Business equipment such as station platforms and freight yards had been built in succession, and various businesses should be gradually increased. Therefore, it was approved that from July 1st, the Ministry's General Rules for Passenger Car Transportation of the Republic of China Railway, General Rules for Freight Car Transportation, General Rules for Responsible Freight Car Transportation, and Waybill Regulations would be fully applied. The previously established Provisional Rules for Passenger and Freight Transportation of this Railway were repealed at the same time. In light of the special circumstances of this railway, nine supplementary rules for passenger car transportation and eleven supplementary rules for freight car transportation were drafted and submitted for approval and promulgation. Also from July 1st, responsible freight intermodal transport began with the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways.</p>
<p>The operational revenue from the opening of traffic to Jianshan on June 1 of the 20th year to June 30 of the 22nd year, according to the fiscal year, listed as the 20th year (including revenue in June of the 20th year) and the 21st year, excluding miscellaneous revenue, is as follows:</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>Vehicles: The vehicles currently owned by the railway were purchased with the construction capital of the Jiangshan-Lanxi section, totaling nine locomotives, thirty passenger cars, and eighty freight cars. Those purchased with the construction capital of the Jinhua-Yushan section, i.e., ordered with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, totaled six locomotives, twenty-four passenger car underframes, and fifty freight car underframes. Currently, except for the fifty freight car underframes, which arrived in October and have been assembled and can be added to transport, only one locomotive can arrive this year. The remaining five locomotives and twenty-four passenger car underframes are expected to arrive next spring.</p>
<p>Stations: There are a total of 36 stations on the entire railway. Zhakou and Sanlangmiao stations are specially set up to facilitate passengers and freight crossing the river and are limited to business operations. Those in the Jiangshan-Lanxi section include Jingjiang, Jiangbian, Lushan, Bailutang, Linpu, Jianshan, Meichi, Zhibu, Baimen, Zhuji, Paitou, Anhua, Suixi, Yiwu, Yiting, Xiaoshun, Tangya, Jinhua, Zhuma Pavilion, and Lanxi, totaling 20 stations. Those in the Jinhua-Yushan section include Gufang, Yangxi, Huzhen, Longyou, Anren, Zhangshutan, Quzhou, Erlishijie, Houxijie, Jiangshan, Hecun, Xintangbian, Xiazhen, and Yushan, totaling 14 stations.</p>
<p>Train Services: Currently, there are two direct passenger trains running back and forth each day on the Jiangshan-Lanxi section, and one mixed train running back and forth between Jiangbian and Jinhua. Between Jinhua and Quzhou, material trains are temporarily used to carry passengers and freight. After the opening of the entire line on December 28, there will be two direct passenger trains running back and forth each day between Jiangbian and Yushan, and one mixed train running back and forth each day between Jiangbian and Jinhua, Jinhua and Yushan, and Jinhua and Lanxi.</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>The railway engineering bureau originally had two departments: engineering and general affairs. The director of the bureau also served as the chief engineer, and the deputy director served as the director of general affairs. There were also secretaries, section chiefs, and division chiefs. Due to austerity, the two departments were abolished and replaced by four sections: general affairs, engineering, transportation, and accounting. The secretary was also dismissed. The general affairs section was divided into five subsections: documentation, materials, land and fields, general affairs, and personnel. The materials subsection managed material factories and locations. The engineering section was divided into three subsections: design, bridges, and construction, and also directed the first, second, and third main engineering sections. The transportation section was divided into three subsections: train operations, locomotive operations, and police affairs. Train, locomotive, and police affairs were each divided into sections, all under the jurisdiction of their respective managing subsections. The locomotive operations subsection, in addition to managing its sections, also managed the machine factory, the vehicle maintenance facility, and the locomotive materials depot. The accounting section was divided into three subsections: comprehensive review, inspection, and cashier.</p>
<h3>The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and Highways (Ti Cheng)</h3>
<p>The original route of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, from Hangzhou upwards, was originally along the west bank of the Fuchun River through Tonglu and Jiande counties to reach Lanxi. Due to the difficulty of the project and the high cost, there was a proposal to change the route. In the winter of the 18th year, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was stalled, and Chairman Zhang of the provincial government transferred colleagues from the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to build the Xiaoshan-Jinhua-Lanxi-Changshan highway. Because the terrain along the line was flat, the Construction Department, with the approval of the provincial government, decided to convert this route into a light railway. The Xiaochang highway had long been designated as the main trunk line in the hinterland of the province. Now that it has been converted into a railway, the highway route has had to be changed accordingly. The current fourth trunk line of the new highway network plan in the province, the Hangguang Line, 丨丨 which is a section of the third trunk line of the Seven-Province Highway, the Hu-Gui Line, 丨丨 the reason for extending the Hangfu Road to Lanxi is for this reason. This exchange history of this section of the route is the beginning of the relationship between the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the highway. Now that the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has officially opened to traffic on the entire line, the Hangzhou-Guangdong highway project has also been completed section by section. Looking back on the day of completion, recalling the decision to change the route in the 18th year, which allowed the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to be completed quickly, although the highway felt a little difficult, there was not much obstacle to progress. It can be seen that the provincial and department heads weighed the priorities and appropriate actions that day, and it is also worth commemorating that the railway and highway can exchange routes to express the spirit of mutual assistance.</p>
<p>After the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway changed its route, Xixing became the starting point of the entire line due to the separation of the Qiantang River. The river is vast and cannot be easily dredged. The transportation of passengers and goods is inconvenient. On the highway side, Zhejiang's east and west could not be connected because of the Qiantang River. Therefore, the need for the Qiantang River Bridge is shared by both the railway and the highway, and it is urgently needed. Fortunately, with the approval of the provincial government, the Construction Department has been committed to the grand vision of developing eastern Zhejiang. It has entrusted experts to carefully study the design of the Qiantang River Bridge and stipulated that the railway and highway should run on the same bridge. The transportation revenue is used as a guarantee for the bridge construction cost. Therefore, the cooperation between the railway and the highway is closer because of the Qiantang River Bridge. In the future, the prosperity of the economy and society in eastern Zhejiang will advance with the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and highway business, which can be predicted.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the number of people crossing the Qiantang River by ferry has increased day by day, reaching more than 400,000 people per month. However, the ferry equipment is simple, and the western and docks have not yet been built, making it inconvenient for travelers. Although the Qiantang River Bridge has been designed, it is slow to solve the urgent need, and the ferry still needs to be improved. According to the current plan, in addition to reorganizing the existing docks and ferries, it is planned to start the construction of the Hanyang dock immediately. The funding has also been stipulated to be borne jointly by the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau, the Highway Bureau, and local people. The day of construction will not be far away. This is a facility that the province should have to facilitate transportation on both sides of the river before the Qiantang River Bridge is built, and the railway and highway authorities especially hope for its early success.</p>
<p>The nature of highways is to supplement the shortcomings of railway transportation. Since Zhejiang Province has the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and is urgently seeking the development of eastern Zhejiang, all highway plans should be based on this principle and strive to assist the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and develop together within the possible scope. Now, the major stations of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway are connected to highway lines. Let's list them below:</p>
<p>(1) Xiaoshan Station: The highways that connect to Xiaoshan, such as the Xiaoshao, Shao Cao Sheng, and Sheng Xin sections, all rely on this station to connect with the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, which is the hub for Shaoxing to use the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. (2) Zhuji Station: This station is connected to the Shao-Zhuji road to facilitate transportation to Shaoxing. (3) Yiwu Station: This station is connected to the Yi-Dong road, and then through Dongyang via Changle to connect to Sheng County and transfer to Taizhou, so that all parts of Taizhou enjoy the convenience of railway transportation. Furthermore, counties in Ningbo can also reach Xinchang via the Fengxin road, and then through the Shengxin and Shengchang roads to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway.</p>
<p>(4) Jinhua Station: This station is connected to the Jin-Yong, Yong Jin, and Jin-Li roads to reach counties under the jurisdiction of Lishui. Roads under the jurisdiction of Lishui, such as the Li-Yun, Long Li Qing, and Wen roads, are all under construction. After completion in the future, Wenzhou and Lishui will be connected to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway through Jinhua.</p>
<p>(5) Lanxi Station: This station can be connected to Jiande, Dun'an, and Suian counties to reach the border.</p>
<p>(6) Longyou Station: From this station, go through Xikou in Longyou to reach Suichang and Songyang, and then connect to the counties under the jurisdiction of Lishui.</p>
<p>(7) Quzhou Station:</p>
<p>(8) Jiangshan Station: From these two stations, you can rely on the connection of the Qu-Chang, Chang Yu, Qu-Jiang, and Jiang-Guang Jiang Pu roads to directly reach Yushan and Guangfeng in Jiangxi and Pucheng and Jianou in Fujian. The well-connected transportation of Quzhou has the effect of surrounding and supporting the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. The above roads may be completed, not completed, under construction, or under planning. All highway colleagues are working to implement the provincial and department officials' intention to develop eastern Zhejiang and assist the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. As for the Quzhou-Lanxi and Quzhou-Jiangshan sections, although some sections are parallel to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, Quzhou is an important military town, and it is necessary to add a transportation auxiliary line. Moreover, during the construction of the Jinhua-Yushan section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, these two sections of the highway had already been completed, which greatly facilitated the transportation of all materials and the transfer of employees. The early completion of the Jinhua-Yushan section was also due to the Quzhou-Lanxi and Quzhou-Jiangshan highways. Even after the entire Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is opened to traffic, it can rely on short-distance business to maintain itself and achieve complementary effects. There is no competition.</p>
<p>Since the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the highway have the same mission of developing eastern Zhejiang, it is expected that the production of various places in eastern Zhejiang will increase and transportation will be more frequent in the future. Although the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has been opened to traffic and the new highway network plan in this province will soon be completed, the operation methods still need to be improved. It is hoped that the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the highway will today discuss and agree on a proper intermodal transport method, so that the great event of developing eastern Zhejiang will have a greater effect. This is also a major task that the railway and highway colleagues should work together on.</p>
<p>As the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway holds its opening ceremony, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau will compile and publish a special publication, and I was asked to contribute an article. I believe that the province has railways. Except for Guangdong and the three northeastern provinces, only Zhejiang has it now. The great achievements of past chairmen and department heads are well-known to the people of Zhejiang and do not need my words. Furthermore, the Chinese people are allowed to build railways themselves. After the Ping-Sui Railway, only the current Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway exists. Director Du diligently handled the matter from beginning to end, and the contributions of the colleagues involved are also well-known to the people of Zhejiang and do not need my words. What I want to say is something else. I have been in charge of the provincial highway bureau for many years, and highways are inherently supplementary to railway transportation. At this time, when the provincial and department officials are actively developing eastern Zhejiang, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the highway share this mission. Therefore, the past relationship, future cooperation, and current connection between the two parties are what I should say. What do the people of Zhejiang and the colleagues of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau think?</p>
<h3>Guide to Ceremony Program and Sightseeing</h3>

<h3>Transportation Facilities and Management Policies of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway</h3>
<p>— Jin Shi Kuan</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>The mission of Zhejiang Province in building the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is to facilitate the transportation of people and develop the economy of the interior. With its completion, it will run through Zhejiang Province and connect Jiangxi and Fujian. Its economic mission is undoubtedly significant, and it also occupies an important position in politics and military affairs. We are operating this railway to seek the development of business and transportation, to ensure that the people along the line receive the greatest convenience and benefits, and to ensure that the railway itself not only balances its income and expenditure but also has a surplus to repay the principal. All colleagues serving on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway can recognize this point and strive not to fail the mission of building this railway.</p>
<p>Although the Jinhua-Yushan section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has just been completed, the Hangzhou-Jiangbian to Lanxi section has been in operation for more than two years. The transportation facilities and management policies of the Jiang-Lan section in the past two years have also been quite different from those of other railways in our country. After the full line is opened to traffic, we should continue to implement this policy and make changes. I hope that experts from all walks of life can teach us.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Transportation Facilities</p>
<p>(1) Emphasize Third-Class Passenger Cars Most railways have passenger classes divided into three or four classes. Passenger revenue, however, shows that the third and fourth classes account for almost 90% of the total. Therefore, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway recognizes this point and puts its full spirit into organizing third-class passenger cars. The air, light, and cleanliness facilities are all above those of other railways, which is generally acknowledged.</p>
<p>(2) Operating Small Worker Trains in Winter The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway all operates fourth-class cars to benefit ordinary people. Although the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway does not have this facility, it specially operates worker trains in winter because many people along the line go out to work and return to their hometowns in winter. Its nature is no different from the fourth class of other railways.</p>
<p>(3) Third-Class Chinese Dining Cars Most railways use Western-style cuisine for passenger food facilities, which not only promotes foreign goods but also has expensive prices and does not conform to Chinese habits, making passengers feel inconvenienced. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway does not sell Western food and divides Chinese food into three grades to facilitate passengers of all levels. In addition, it cancels the peddling of miscellaneous foods in third-class cars to maintain order.</p>
<p>(4) Adding Second and Third-Class Sleeping Cars The sleeping car facilities on various railways are limited to the first and second classes. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is now adding second and third-class sleeping cars to facilitate night train passengers.</p>
<p>B. Freight</p>
<p>From the perspective of the railway's business itself, developing freight transportation is even more important than passenger transportation. Because the equipment cost of passenger transportation is greater than that of freight transportation, the development of freight transportation should be especially noted. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway's development of freight transportation facilities can also be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Implementing Responsible Transportation The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway handled responsible transportation from the beginning of freight transportation, initially with limited regulations. Since July 1933, the railway has been fully responsible for the goods, and compensation will be paid according to regulations if there is any loss. However, since its implementation, there have been very few compensation matters, which shows that responsible transportation is not difficult to handle, as long as the management procedures of the employees are complete. Moreover, responsible transportation does not increase prices, as it is considered the responsibility of the railway bureau.</p>
<p>(2) Expanding the Scope of Freight Transportation The methods are divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The places through which the railway line passes are not all famous cities and towns, so it is necessary to find ways to absorb goods from farther away. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has built connecting docks or sidings at Xiaoshan, Linpu, Yiwu, Jinhua, and Lanxi stations, directly reaching the waterfront and implementing water-land connection transportation.</p>
<p>(2) At the Sanlang and Zhakou docks in Hangzhou, stations are set up separately to carry goods and handle ferry procedures.</p>
<p>(3) It is planned to set up business offices in the center of the city to receive goods and transport them to the station on behalf of the merchants. These are all methods to facilitate merchants and expand the scope of freight transportation.</p>
<p>(3) Commercializing Freight Transportation Methods Most of China's railways are government-run and have a monopoly nature, so business methods inevitably become stained with officialdom habits. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway starts from commercial principles in its business, on the one hand, correcting the way employees treat merchants, and on the other hand, imparting railway transportation knowledge to passengers and merchants. The implementation methods are: one is to print the railway transportation regulations into advertisements and post them everywhere, even in various towns along the line, to avoid the transfer company from manipulating them. The second is to give merchants the opportunity to express their opinions, convene transportation conferences in important cities along the line, and the railway bureau and merchants jointly discuss and communicate their opinions. The third is to train employees and pay attention to business habits, and treat merchants with a peaceful and sincere attitude.</p>
<p>C. Intermodal Transportation</p>
<p>The joint passenger transportation method between the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been implemented since January 1932. The responsible freight intermodal transportation method was implemented in July 1933. The midway formalities can be avoided, and the commission of the transfer company can be saved. The burden on merchants is reduced, the sales of goods are increased, and the railway business is also increased. After the full line is opened to traffic, it is planned to join the national intermodal transportation, and freight transportation will surely improve. For example, paper products along the line can be directly transported to the north. As for the intermodal transportation with the highways connected to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, such as the Xiaoshao, Jinyongwu, Yidong, and Jiangpu roads, we are separately discussing the methods. However, water-land intermodal transportation cannot be realized for a while because the waterways and ships do not have a formal organization.</p>
<p>D. Business Conditions</p>
<p>The business income of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway in 1932 was more than 1.26 million yuan, of which 600,000 yuan was in the first half of the year and 660,000 yuan in the second half of the year, with an average increase of 10,000 yuan per month. At the beginning of 1933, from July to October 1933, the average monthly income was 120,000 yuan, an increase of 20% compared with the second half of 1932. It can be said that there will be an increase when the Jinyu section is opened to traffic in the future. As for the number of passengers, there were 970,000 people in 1932, with an average of 80,000 people per month. In January of this year, the number of passengers exceeded 100,000 after the worker's car was added. The tonnage of freight, excluding engineering and official cargo, was 68,000 tons in 1932, of which 25,000 tons were in the second half of last year and 43,000 tons were in the first half of this year. The increase in tonnage is quite large, which shows that more and more merchants are using railway transportation.</p>
<p>E. Developing the Local Economy</p>
<p>The purpose of developing transportation is not only to make it conform to economic principles, but also to bear the mission of developing the agricultural, industrial, and commercial industries in the places it passes through, so that they can support each other. Railways in various countries have organizations to study, investigate, and revitalize the industries along the line. The South Manchurian and Central Eastern Railways also used this method, and their businesses have developed. Although the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway does not have the spare capacity to directly support the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce along the line, we have investigated the economic situation in various places and found several points that can be reported:</p>
<p>(1) The population along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is quite dense, and the products are not self-sufficient. People often go to work in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area and return to their hometowns in winter to spend the year, so there is a mobile nature.</p>
<p>(2) The economic situation along the line is still the organization of the rural society. The products are mostly agricultural products and livestock. The exported goods, in addition to rice, are mostly by-products such as pigs and cattle. The imported goods, in Hangzhou, are natural fertilizers collected from Jiaxing, Huzhou, Suzhou, and Changzhou, as well as foreign goods such as cotton yarn, cloth, kerosene, sugar, and fertilizers. In the Ningbo-Shaoxing area, they are salt, cotton yarn, and cloth. Most of them are raw materials for trading manufactured goods, and the value cannot be offset, which leads to the decline of the rural economy. Therefore, it is urgent to support the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce along the line.</p>
<p>(3) There are two inland commercial routes in the Jiangshan area of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, one to Fujian and the other to Jiangxi. The economic organization is similar to that of the Jinhua-Quzhou area, and it is also necessary to support its development.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Management Policies</p>
<p>The key points of railway management are efficiency and economy. Based on these two objectives, the management policies of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway can be described in the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Adopting an Efficient Organization The organization of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau is simple and effective. Under the director, there are only four sections: General Affairs, Engineering, Transportation, and Accounting. After the opening of traffic, the three parts related to transportation, namely, car affairs, machinery affairs, and police affairs, are combined into a transportation section. The responsibility is specialized, the command is convenient, and cooperation is easy. The sections are divided into shares, with small scopes and few people.</p>
<p>(2) Strictly Implementing the Budget System To seek the economic management of the railway, the budget must be used as the standard for the allocation of funds. Since its opening, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has strictly implemented the budget system. All capital expenditures and business expenditures are specified in detail in advance. Since there is a fixed allocation standard for funds, the expenditure and income can be adapted, the debts can be repaid, and the credit can be maintained.</p>
<p>(3) Reducing the Business Percentage The business percentage is the ratio of expenditure to income. The business income of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway in 1932 was 1.26 million yuan, and the business expenditure was 880,000 yuan. The ratio of income to expenditure is less than 65%, and we must find ways to reduce it further. In China, the income-expenditure ratio of the Beining Railway is less than 50%, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is 65%, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is 70%, and the South Manchurian Railway, which is operated by the Japanese, is 30%. This depends on whether the management is effective and economical. Now that the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is fully completed, the income will definitely increase, and the expenditure will definitely not increase in the same proportion. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>(4) Training Employees To increase the efficiency of railway management, we must first seek to improve the organization and supplement talent. After the opening of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, we recruited students with appropriate levels for the various positions needed in advance and set up three training classes for car affairs, machinery affairs, and police affairs, teaching practical courses and implementing strict operational training. Currently, 220 people have completed the training and have been assigned to serve. The completion of the Jinyu section and the fact that no new people have been appointed in the three parts of car machinery and police are also one of the innovations of this railway.</p>
<p>(5) Improving Police Efficiency The railway police were originally set up to maintain order, protect passengers and goods, and supplement the shortage of local police force. In addition to the aforementioned two duties, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Police can also check passenger tickets, which can save many station staff and improve their status. In addition, the railway police are ordered to guard the goods in place of the cargo porters. The police must also obey the command of the station chief to unify their authority. Therefore, the disadvantages of the police not listening to the station chief's command and conflicts with the car affairs staff have not been seen on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway.</p>
<h3>The Operation of Railcars on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway</h3>
<p>(4) The Experience of Jiang</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's operation of railways is not the beginning of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan line. At the end of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, the Zhejiang Railway Company was initiated, and the sections from Zhakou to Gongchen Bridge, Hangzhou to Fengjing, and Cao'e River to Ningbo were completed one after another. Zhejiang Province had such achievements as early as 25 years ago. Later, due to the Qing government's advocacy of national railway ownership and the high cost of the Zhejiang Railway itself, poor management, and inability to maintain it, the government took over in 1914, but the invested capital was not recovered. Now, under the guidance of the chief officer and the efforts of the responsible personnel, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has achieved considerable results in a short period of time and in an environment of economic difficulties, which has had a great impact on the future of China's railways. The currently commercially operated Wuzha Road, Yuping Road, Zhanglong Road, Tongpu Road, and Chengyu Road are all planning to follow the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway method and proceed actively in separate areas, changing the trend of national railway ownership and shifting the psychology of social construction difficulties. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has made considerable contributions. From this, it can be seen that in China, where financial resources are difficult, only the central government can formulate principles. All national trunk lines and national defense border lines should be built by the central government as soon as possible, and the provincial lines should be given economic and technical assistance by the central government and handled by the provinces separately. Only through the cooperation of the central government and the provinces can China's railway construction be opened up and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's plan for 100,000 miles of railways be gradually completed. This is the feeling that Shixuan has gained from serving on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway.</p>
<h3>The Future of Telephone Service along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>Railways, highways, and telecommunications all occupy the same position in transportation and bear the same mission, complementing each other and having their own special uses. Zhejiang Province has a considerable history in highways and telecommunications, and the scale can be said to be roughly complete. Now, the only state-owned railway in the country, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, is scheduled to hold a full line opening ceremony. I would like to make a brief contribution on the distribution of Zhejiang Province's long-distance telephone lines along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the future of the business:</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Province telecommunications network divides the province into seven major trunk lines: Hangzhou-Changxing, Hangzhou-Ningbo, Ningbo-Wenzhou, Hangzhou-Quzhou, Quzhou-Wenzhou, Hangzhou-Chuzhou, and Hangzhou-Fengjing. The Hangzhou-Changxing line passes through Yuhang, Wukang, Wuxing, and reaches Changxing, connecting Jiangsu to reach Nanjing. The Hangzhou-Ningbo line runs along the Hangzhou-Ningbo Road to Ningbo. The Ningbo-Wenzhou line passes through Ninghai, Linhai, Huangyan, Yueqing, and reaches Yongjia, which will be connected to Fujian in the future. The Hangzhou-Quzhou line runs along the Qiantang River, often connecting Changshan with Jiangxi. The Quzhou-Wenzhou line passes through Qu County, Longyou, Suichang, Songyang, Lishui, Qingtian, and reaches Yongjia. The Hangzhou-Chuzhou line passes through Hangzhou, along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road, through Jinhua, Wuyi, Yongkang, Jinyun, and reaches Lishui. The Hangzhou-Fengjing line runs from Hangzhou, along the Hangzhou-Shanghai Road, connecting Jiangsu to reach Shanghai. Therefore, the entire Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway line accounts for two of the province's long-distance telephone trunk lines: Hangzhou, passing through Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu to reach Jinhua, is the first section of the Hangzhou-Chuzhou trunk line; Lanxi, passing through Longyou, Qu County, Jiangshan to reach Yushan, is the end section of the Hangzhou-Quzhou trunk line; Jinhua and Lanxi are connected by the Jinlan branch line. In addition, there are branch lines laid between Yiwu and Pujiang, Yiwu and Dongyang, Jinhua and Wuyi, Jinhua and Yongkang, Longyou and Suichang, Jiangshan and Changshan, and Lanxi and Tangxi. Therefore, wherever the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway reaches, not only can long-distance telephones be used, but it can also be connected to any of the 71 counties in the province that have long-distance telephones, as well as Beijing and Shanghai. Travelers in Zhejiang, thanks to the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, can start from Qiantang in the morning and stay overnight in Xianxia; they can also use the dense Zhejiang telecommunications network to be able to confide in their family and children, even when they are thousands of miles away, to comfort the feelings of the traveler. ( )</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned long-distance telecommunications network, there are urban telephone facilities in Jinhua, Lanxi, Qu County, Jiangshan, and other places along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. The telephone users in Jinhua and Lanxi are both around one or two hundred, all of which are operated by provincial funds. The urban telephones in Qu County and Jiangshan were originally prepared by the respective counties, but because of the construction of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, it is necessary to strive to expand them to meet the needs; however, due to the poor efficiency of the original components, it is difficult to maintain them, and they will also be transferred to the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau for takeover, in order to improve and facilitate the reorganization. The urban telephone in Longyou was not urgently needed, but recently it has also been affected by the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, and the commerce is advancing rapidly, and there is a feeling that the urban telephone there cannot be delayed; the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau is also in the process of planning.</p>
<p>The business of Zhejiang Province's long-distance telephones along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road was originally the most developed in Lanxi; the annual turnover was more than 10,000 yuan; followed by Jinhua, reaching more than 7,000 yuan; followed by Qu County, about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan; the other bureaus were between 4,000 to 5,000 yuan and 2,000 yuan. However, since the full line of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was opened to traffic, Lanxi's business has been declining day by day, while Jinhua's business is booming and has a tendency to replace it. Recently, since the completion of the Jinyu section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the telephone traffic between Longyou, Qu County, and Jiangshan has been progressing at the same time as Jinhua; the most developed long-distance telephones in the past, such as Lanxi, will shift its center of gravity to Jinhua, and Longyou, Qu County, Jiangshan, and others, which were considered insignificant in the past, will be advancing in conjunction with the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway business. The transportation industry is closely related to economic development, and the economic situation of a place changes in prosperity and decline with changes in transportation conditions.</p>
<p>In short, transportation tools complement each other, and the local economy also develops with the transportation industry. Those who are determined to build should be aware of this!</p>

<h3>The Philosophy of the Circle</h3>
<p>— Qu Chen</p>
<p>Among all shapes, squares have too many edges and corners; triangles make people think of unharmonious love; length is slow, while shortness is cramped; thickness is heavy, while thinness is frivolous; only the circle is the most complete, the most widely used, and the most popular.</p>
<p>For example, the wheel is round, so it can travel thousands of miles. The door hinge is round, so it can turn easily. The rice bowl is round, which is just right for the mouth. The toilet is round, which fits perfectly to the buttocks. If these things are all changed to squares, then the wheel will not move, the door will not open, the mouth will be sore when eating, and you will feel like sitting on pins and needles when defecating. The embarrassment is indescribable.</p>
<p>Therefore, all useful things are "round for the most important".</p>
<p>Not only in utensils, but also in art. Past poets sang "six inches of round skin with exquisite light." Modern poets sing about "full breasts!" and so on. All worshipers of curved beauty are, in other words, worshipers of "round." The strongest supporter is the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes, who shouted "Don't ruin my circle" when he was killed by the Romans.</p>
<p>As for being a person, one must speak. Because sharpness is close to meanness, and squares have too many edges and corners, there are times when they are useless. It is never as good as the round's completeness, which follows the way of heaven and can be used in all directions without hindrance.</p>
<p>For example, if you go out occasionally in October weather and suddenly meet a consumptive ghost-like friend who is wearing heavy fur clothes and still saying he is cold, then if he "greets" you, you must not tell him your own experience, saying that the weather is not as cold as he said, because in his feelings, the sky is indeed so cold. If you say an experience that is contrary to his, he will suspect that you are intentionally messing with him. It is best to say, "Ah, the weather is really cold!" You naturally understand in your stomach, but your friend is therefore satisfied and will consider you a "comrade."</p>
<p>Also, if a nearsighted friend insists on calling a sparrow flying in the air an eagle, you must not argue with him about what it is. Because in his vision, it may indeed be an eagle. The result of the argument is that the victory is not necessarily yours, but the breakdown of the relationship is certain.</p>
<p>Here, I think of a typical character.</p>
<p>Shishuo Xinyu quoted Sima Hui's separate biography: "Sima Hui had a humanistic sense of judgment. He lived in Jingzhou and knew that Liu Biao was dark and would harm good people, so he kept silent and did not talk about current affairs. Someone asked Hui about people, but he never distinguished their merits. Every time he said it was good. His wife admonished him, saying, "People are doubtful about quality, you should argue, but you don't say good to everyone, how can people consult you?" Hui said, "As you say, it's also good." The language is quite humorous. This is indeed a good way to preserve life in a well-governed world. De Cao is truly worthy of the title of "Water Mirror." If he had listened to the words of a woman, he would have been a continuation of Kong Beihai Mi Zhengping, who was fond of discussing figures at the time. Therefore, the study of the circle is not to be ignored!</p>
<h3>The Misfortune of Women</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>The most miserable people in the world are Chinese women.</p>
<p>Those women from poor families worry about breakfast and then dinner. Emaciated, they beg for food everywhere. I cannot bear to describe their suffering. Their life story is a blurred mess of bloodstains. They are a group abandoned outside of human life by the pressure of history.</p>
<p>Those women from wealthy families, including wives, young mistresses, young ladies, as well as decorative objects and actresses, wear short shorts, long stockings, high heels, expose their bare arms and chests, or naked, fleshy thighs. They go to companies to cut fabric, to dance halls to dance, ride in cars, go to theaters, parks, gambling dens, dog racing tracks, pelota courts... In these places where human desires run rampant, countless modern men accompany them all day long, living carefree lives. I do not want to describe their life story. I do not want to talk about these "gilded parasites."</p>
<p>The fortunate and unfortunate destinies of humanity are thus decided. Every day, when we read the newspaper, we can always find headlines in large characters, using extremely vivid words to describe many scandalous love affairs about women, such as "King of Acrobats and Miss Sun," "The Mermaid and Her Protector"... Records of absolutely no value, or publishing fleshy photos for those concerned to sing and sigh, but there is no cry of the street beggar, no dirty and ragged image! The market is full of fleshly temptations and a torrent of lust, but we cannot hear the curse of life, the miserable cry of death!</p>
<p>People are so fascinated with fleshly and flirtatious things, and they are so enthusiastically promoting Western civilization. In contrast, society uses all its power to oppress the poor and helpless women, forcing them to transform into modern women, sacrificing their looks, or standing on the street corner with tears in their eyes!</p>
<p>How heartbreaking this is!</p>
<p>Although wealthy people are standing on the ground of Western civilization, energetically venting their sexual desires, ordinary poor women also take advantage of the weaknesses of this society. Under the banners of modernity, fitness, etc., there is a dance party today, a fashion exhibition tomorrow, and a beauty contest the day after, with the gimmicks of nude bathing. Chinese women, with no way forward, all move in this direction, begging for the leftovers squandered by those young masters! But China is, after all, a country of ancient civilization. When this wave of Westernized licentiousness rises to its peak, the supporters of the old era, witnessing the signs of national ruin, launch a counterattack of the era, which is to "maintain morality" and promote "propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame."</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a telegram from Peiping: "Yuan Liang strictly prohibits dancing... A large number of dancers and male and female patrons were arrested at the Sanchun Dance Hall."</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the newspaper reported that Nanjing, after banning prostitution, felt that it could not be banned in reality, and then ordered it to be lifted, but the inspection was very strict.</p>
<p>The old capital and the new capital look at women so strictly. The decrees banning dancing and prostitution are so frightening, shaking the hearts of those poor women who sell their art and their bodies. This makes us deeply feel that another kind of sorrow of China's Westernization is to trap Chinese women in an abyss from which they cannot extricate themselves; and to moan painfully in this abyss, without any social sympathy. Society has no politeness or respect for them, only teasing and destruction. The pressure inherited from historical traditions abandons them outside the circle of human life.</p>
<p>Today, these pitiful Chinese women, with no way to make a living, have fallen. This is a fact. But to say that they have destroyed "morality" and lost "propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame" is a great injustice. "Morality" and "propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame" have been swept away by Western ways, and they have also been intoxicated by Western ways. The gentlemen who are banning dancing and prostitution today should first recognize this fact and not praise those who sell their souls to the heavens and beat those who sell their bodies to hell. Those who shout "Long live women's liberation" should also open their eyes to see if this is the era when the misfortune of women has arrived.</p>
<h3>Miss Fang</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>Miss Fang of the Kang family returned from a school in Shanghai the other day. Her attire was completely modern, completely different from her appearance as a country girl before. As a result, the neighbors were whispering, "Miss Fang's behavior has changed greatly recently! She's only been in Shanghai for half a year, and she's already behaving strangely. It's clear that Shanghai is a bad place! No wonder her aunt said that she went to Shanghai to study, but in reality, she just wanted to pick up a gigolo in Shanghai to be her husband. Now, looking at her 'Westernized' appearance, her aunt's words are definitely true. Alas! What a good girl, to have changed so much, it's really a pity!" Most of the neighbors have an 18th-century perspective, and they cannot help but regard Miss Fang's lively behavior and fashionable dress as irregular. Moreover, they often listen to the fifth aunt, who opposes Miss Fang, and her words that damage Miss Fang's reputation. So, now everyone is unanimously criticizing Miss Fang in this way. It turns out that Miss Fang is the youngest daughter of Mr. Kang. Her mother is Mr. Kang's fourth concubine. She was born with a charming appearance and a graceful figure. Her bright black eyes and two intoxicatingly charming dimples add to her beautiful demeanor. Therefore, the young masters in X Town are all infatuated and eagerly come to the Kang residence to propose marriage. However, her parents regard her as the apple of their eye and love her extremely, so how could they easily promise her to someone? As a result, she has been kept at home until the age of eighteen and has not yet been selected. Although she is accustomed to being spoiled, her temperament is very gentle, and her demeanor is also generous. Because she grew up in the countryside, where customs are old-fashioned, she has been hidden in her boudoir since she was a child and has not left her house. All her actions are completely in the style of an 18th-century lady. Mr. Kang often opposes modern women going to school, saying that it is outrageous for men and women to mix together. "A woman without talent is virtuous." What is the use of learning? Therefore, Miss Fang has not received any education until the age of eighteen and has no knowledge in her mind. As a result, people call her "an embroidered pillow!" Unfortunately, in the spring of last year, Miss Fang's mother suddenly fell ill and died! Two months later, her father married a fifth concubine, who came from a brothel, had a romantic temperament, and a frivolous demeanor. Her tolerance was also very narrow. Whether it was eating or wearing, she was stingy and calculating, so as soon as she entered the house, she and Miss Fang became like fire and water and often had conflicts. Behind her back, she also instigated Mr. Kang to be cold to his daughter. Mr. Kang was originally a confused idiot and only loved beauty, so he immediately overturned his usual love for his daughter and scolded Miss Fang every day. The fifth concubine secretly added various restrictions and oppressions to Miss Fang's diet and expenses. At this time, Miss Fang was extremely sad. She thought of how much her mother loved her when she was alive and how comfortable her life was. Now that her mother is dead, and a "concubine" has been brought in, her father looks down on her and she has suffered all kinds of cruel oppressions. So, how can she survive if things continue like this day after day? Moreover, she does not know a single word, and she has no knowledge at all. Won't the marriage problem in the future also be hindered? In addition, the fifth concubine opposes her, and the marriage that her father makes will definitely not have good results! It is better to take advantage of the fact that she cannot live in peace at home and go to the outside world to study for a few years. With knowledge, she can make her own decisions in everything. When she thought of this, she felt extremely sad and could not help but sob. But, when she thought again that staying at home was not a good idea, she left home in the summer of that year and went to study at XX Girls' School in Shanghai. Since Miss Fang went to Shanghai to study, the fifth concubine often talked to people, saying, "When a girl gets older, her mind will become active. There are many beautiful people in Shanghai. She is going to recruit a young official! Otherwise, she is already eighteen years old. Why is she still going to school? Isn't it like 'playing drums and trumpets at the school when she's eighty years old, with a short life and short breath'? Alas! A lady from a wealthy family is so shameless and goes to Shanghai to pretend to study. It's really a shame to the Kang family!" So, this time, when Miss Fang came back from a school in Shanghai, the neighbors said that her "behavior had changed greatly."</p>
<h3>On the Standards of "Feminine Beauty"</h3>
<p>— Li Yue</p>
<p>Whether it is in a feudal society or a capitalist society, as long as it is a system centered on men, women are often regarded as commodities or playthings. Since women are regarded as commodities or playthings, there is naturally a distinction between superior and inferior, beautiful and ugly. In our China, women in this kind of society used to take absolute "morbid" conditions as the standard of superior beauty. Therefore, the typical woman under this standard must have a waist like a "willow branch," "golden lotus" feet, a "melon seed" face, and "sheep fat" skin. In addition, the chest should be flat, the head should be lowered, the hands should be small and thin, and the legs should be thin and weak; the eyes should be fixed as if they contain a bag of autumn water, and the cheeks should often fly with shy red clouds; they should also be melancholic and sickly, too weak to wear clothes, and even a gust of wind seems to blow them away... This means that the thinner the better, the sicker the more beautiful; the names "sick beauty" and "thin beauty" are born like this. However, the lifestyle of these "beauties" and "fair women" is very simple, they are just long-term slaves of men.</p>
<p>In recent years, the storm of Europe and the United States has swept across the entire mainland of China, penetrating the hearts of every man and woman in China. The standards of excellence and beauty for women, no, commodities and playthings, have been drastically transformed from "morbid" conditions to complete "flirtatiousness"! Standing at the forefront of this storm and calling themselves women of the era, they have all fully expressed their flirtatiousness and charm under this modern new standard of "enchanting." Thus, the heels are higher, the buttocks are twisted, the thighs are bare, the hair is curled, and the eyebrows are shaved and redrawn so thin, so long, and so black; the lips are like blood, the breasts are trembling, and the face is no different from a monkey's buttocks... This means that the more enchanting the more beautiful, the more charming the more valuable! Really, the facts show it, especially in Shanghai, which is full of foreigners, it is expressed most thoroughly; many serious things, as well as many things of promotion and wealth, success and prosperity, are mostly for or rely on this flirtatiousness! This charm! So, naturally, this flirtatiousness becomes a commodity in one aspect and is regarded as a plaything in another. But their lifestyles are different from "long-term slaves of men"; they can blow smoke rings, eat candied chestnuts and chocolate all day long, go to companies to cut fabrics, go to dance halls to dance, ride in cars, and go to foreign houses, parks, theaters, gambling dens, dog racing tracks, pelota courts... In these frenzied places where human desires run rampant, there are always large groups of idle modern men like gentlemen accompanying them on carefree outings. They are gilded!</p>
<p>...Whether in the past or now, this expression is undoubtedly deformed! All are crazy! Brutal! Cruel!</p>
<p>However, women, the woman as a commodity and a plaything in a contradictory society and a decadent system, is there no other way for them to express their rational beauty besides the deformed "morbid" conditions and the crazy "flirtatiousness"? How unfortunate this is!</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw a sex education film in "Shanghai". This film is showing another type of feminine beauty, which is the health and beauty of those active and progressive women in a rational system in a society that is absolutely different from ours. Everything in the society there is different from ours; they have no "morbid" conditions, and they have no "flirtatiousness"; they are not thin, not weak, not charming, not delicate, not deformed, and not crazy; their lives are full of boiling blood, the flame of youth, active spirits, and healthy bodies; they are happily and peacefully speeding along a rational and correct path, rushing forward by leaps and bounds towards a bright and pure circle! Driving thousands of miles a day!</p>
<p>This really makes me feel sad and sorrowful for our women! Are we really going to harden our hearts and let our nation degenerate into a terrible situation from which it will never recover? Gentlemen engaged in the women's movement: please, is the task under your shouts of "long live" and the call of bright flags to turn women into deformed and crazy "morbid" and "flirtatious" beings? Or should they be turned into active, progressive, and healthy women? These must be clearly recognized before we can answer our questions with facts.</p>
<h3>To Lili</h3>
<p>— Zheng Qing</p>
<p>Lili:</p>
<p>We have only known each other for a short two years, but I already have a very deep understanding of you. Lili, I really love you. I love your sensibility, your quick wit, your lively manners, I love your straightforwardness, your arrogance, I love the accuracy of your thoughts, and even more I love that you have simple virtues and no shameful coquettishness. You have a delicate and sweet heart, a gentle mind, and no romantic vulgarity. You have the appearance and substance of a truly modern woman, but you have not been corrupted by the so-called modernity of the outside world. Lili, I love you deeply and tirelessly.</p>
<p>But in recent months, your cold and insulting treatment of me has given me great pain. Ah! Lili, is my understanding of you wrong? Lili, are you also like ordinary women with common views? If so, how deep is the pain you have given me; how long will it take to heal? Oh! I know, a poor boy like me is simply not worthy of loving any girl. Can a poor boy also have the good fortune to indulge in love? Love is fundamentally based on money. But, Lili, I don't think of you as such a woman. I want to respect your female personality. You are a high school student, and I don't believe that you would be willing to lower your own personality! If so, what kind of education have you received? Isn't the education you received like whitewashing a wall? Isn't your entry into school just a step towards seduction? It is called a high school student in name, but in reality, it is just a charming</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>fellow who likes to sacrifice everything under mercenary marriage? Writing to this point, the previous scenes have become active in my mind again. Alas! Lili, is it true that women always like shiny money? My heart feels as cold as if I have drunk ice.</p>
<p>Lili, I tell you, in this era of transition between the old and the new, young people who are in such an environment, if they want not to be controlled by the environment, then they must take out their own willpower to fight against this hateful environment. We must control this environment; we certainly do not need to be attached to or sad about the past, but we also do not need to yearn for the future. We only need to grasp reality, only reality is the most reliable. Lili! I hope you will take my words and experience them.</p>
<p>Recently, I learned that you are troubled in your heart. Lili, your heart is so contradictory that it is pitiful. Lili, but you must recognize that even if your own environment makes you troubled, you still have to fight against it, let alone your so-called objective environment!</p>
<p>The time has matured to this point, we have talked about everything, so I hope very much that you can tell me your difficulties. I can tell you directly and happily that I am a poor boy who is completely destitute, but I do not hope to get rich. I only hope that I can stand at the forefront of the era. At least we cannot fall behind. We must fulfill the responsibilities that we young people should bear. We must recognize the shortcomings of society and correct them. Talking to this point, it can be considered a paragraph. I hope you, I hope you very much, think again and again, experience again and again. I am always praying for you like this. You are a high school student. You are responsible for transformation. You always have to supervise</p>
<p>Yourself. Sincerely, December 19th night</p>

<h3>Better Late Than Never</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Please forgive me for disturbing your peace of mind in your busy schedule. However, how can I not do so? The fact is this: I, a junior high school student, had to give up my schooling life due to economic constraints. Not long after, I took on the job of a debt collector in a company. My monthly salary is still enough to make ends meet. As the saying goes: "When a son is old, he should get married; when a daughter is old, she should get married." My father saw my age increasing little by little, but the saying "When a son is old, he should get married" had not yet been put into practice. However, without any savings, how can we afford a wedding in this society dominated by money? However, if we don't do it, we are afraid that people will laugh at us, saying, "Such a big son, and he hasn't started a family yet." Because of this, we borrowed five hundred yuan from someone and married a wife, who is also my wife. With one more person, of course, expenses will increase a lot. The burden becomes heavier day by day, and there is no guarantee of paying back the five hundred yuan for the wedding. It really fits the saying: "What you are marrying is borrowed, what you are sleeping with is debt." We are still living frugally. What if we have children? Wouldn't expenses increase again? Wouldn't the burden be even heavier?</p>
<p>Kind editor! I sincerely ask you to solve this problem that I think is difficult for me. And please tell me, why do people treat marrying off their daughters like doing business? Very sincerely waiting for your reply, Mr. Editor. The end. I wish you peace. Bowing respectfully, Liang Niangdai</p>
<p>Editor's note: The last question raised by Mr. Liang is, "Why do people treat marrying off their daughters like doing business?" This question is easy to answer, but it is also very difficult to solve. This is of course caused by the entire bad society at present, and it is not something that a few people can do, nor is it something that a few people can improve. For us ordinary people, it is not to destroy our ambition, but we are powerless, so we don't need to talk about changing customs and habits. The best way for us to deal with this bad environment is to adopt a firm and clear approach; if you want to do business well, I will not come to make you successful, let's see what you can do. Unfortunately, Mr. Liang and his parents do not have this spirit, and even passive resistance cannot be done. As a result, they are dragged into the water by the evil society and fall into the sea of ​​misery. Since this is a fait accompli, repentance is too late. The only way to remedy it is to make up for it. On the active side, of course, we must work hard to increase income; knowledge, experience, and the full use of opportunities are all important. On the passive side, of course, we must seek to save on expenses; clothing, food, housing, and transportation all need to be tightened. And it is best to practice birth control in the near future, when you are still young and there is no way to produce. After practicing birth control, you should comply with the difficulties. As for the appropriate method of birth control, you should plan in name. In the middle, it is not only unreliable, but also very dangerous. And for the sake of living, few people can use it in a good way.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (29)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(42) I Understand</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai grows tenser by the day, with people panicking as if a major war is about to break out. In the Chinese-controlled areas, trunks, luggage, and citizens are crowding into the foreign concessions in a confused mass, as if a shell will explode on their behinds if they are a step too late. Due to successive civil wars, the citizens have become accustomed to seeking protection under the foreign powers of imperialism. The population within the concessions has increased, and housing prices have soared, partly due to the war.</p>
<p>Our school has been suspended, the magazine has stopped publication, everything has come to a standstill, except that we still have to eat every day.</p>
<p>This afternoon, my maternal uncle Xu Bingnan's daughter, my cousin Xu Huijin, sent a carload of luggage to the office. She asked if there was a place to store it temporarily, until her father rented a house and could move it there.</p>
<p>"Is Uncle still at Xujiahui?"</p>
<p>"Father wasn't planning to flee," my cousin nodded. "But today the driver, A'gen, said that Japanese soldiers had already occupied XX Academy. However, Father's health can't handle too much exertion. He wanted me to deposit the valuables with you first and leave when the situation becomes more critical."</p>
<p>"That's good." I called out loudly to A'fu, "Help A'gen move the luggage to the third floor."</p>
<p>"The third floor? Where should we put it?"</p>
<p>"Sister Min has left, her room is empty."</p>
<p>"Fled to the countryside? Such a tiny bit of courage!" She laughed, and I laughed too.</p>
<p>"Let's talk after the luggage is moved," Xiao Huang's voice was so loud.</p>
<p>A'fu helped A'gen move the luggage to the third floor. The normally tidy bedroom now looked like a cargo hold. There was no trace left of the free-spirited woman, but Hui was still behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The three of them came downstairs to our bedroom. Xiao Huang, no longer like an ugly daughter-in-law afraid to meet her in-laws, was the first to speak.</p>
<p>"Miss Xu, you should have driven Sun Min away long ago!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Huang, you are lost in your fantasies again." My cousin still thought Xiao Huang wouldn't say anything serious and teased him playfully.</p>
<p>"Hmph! You insult me!" He raised his fist and waved it in the air, as if to knock down some target.</p>
<p>I remained silent. My cousin ignored Xiao Huang.</p>
<p>"When did Min leave?" she asked me.</p>
<p>"Almost a month ago, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>My cousin looked suspiciously at Xiao Huang's face, which was taut like a drum.</p>
<p>"Because of a letter from you!" A bombshell exploded.</p>
<p>"Brother?"</p>
<p>"Just two lines of pencil writing," I replied blandly.</p>
<p>"That wasn't what I expected," Sister Hui said softly. "Ever since Mr. Huang joked with her that day, Min came to Xujiahui. She said she was a woman who could not marry, she would not fall in love, because she didn't recognize herself as a woman. Such jokes became commonplace. Later, when you fell ill, we had many opportunities to talk, and Min never revealed her feelings." Sister Hui paused, then looked at Xiao Huang's face again, and continued: "Brother, there is no room for a third party on the path of love. Since that is the case, I have decided to find Min and bring her back. I don't want to do something that someone else doesn't want." Sister Hui stood up as if to leave.</p>
<p>"Miss Xu, what time is it now? This is not the time for love. Sun Min will definitely not come back. If we have the opportunity, we should do something to help the country and show the strength of our people." Xiao Huang said each word slowly, as if preparing the wording of the next sentence while speaking the previous one. Usually, with such an attitude, my cousin would have laughed first.</p>
<p>This was the first time I saw her serious face. After listening to Xiao Huang's words, she didn't speak for a long time. Finally, she stood up and said, "I understand."</p>
<p>"Our comrade!" Xiao Huang's hand shot up, his heels clicking together.</p>
