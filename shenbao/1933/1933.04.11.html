<p>時評</p>
<h3>英首相江渡美（下）信</h3>
<p>（三）戰債問題</p>
<p>世界經濟復興之障碍。賠欵之外。厥爲戰債。蓋聯合國自歐戰期中之軍用借欵。與夫戰後之復興借貸。總數計有一百零三億三千八百餘萬美。金償還期限。計爲六十二年。本利合計有二百二十一億八千八百餘萬美金。迄一九三一年六月胡佛總统宣告停付賠欵戰債之時爲止。其償還總數不過二十六億美金。去年洛桑會議賠欵告一段落。在英法各國。以爲賠欵與戰債。實有聯帶關係。矧對减輕賠欵。於戰債之減輕或免除。實爲其附帶條件之一。而美國所堅持之理由。以爲賠欵與戰債。并不同其性質。加以近年所恃爲繁榮工具之股票證劵。其發行以戰債爲担保者不在少數。惟爲堅持償還乃能保持美國國内外之信用。否則戰債一旦免除。美國之金融界産業界以及農業方面。皆不免蒙受嚴重影。響其爲數雖不過年收三億美金。而國庫收入不足。實以戰債支付延期。更顯痕跡。以故去年年底。美國致英法通牒堅持償還。</p>
<p>英國經愼重考慮之後。乃决意償付。以英蘭銀行所保管一億四千萬磅準備金中百分之十四（計一千九百六十萬磅）記存過户於美。以當償付。此次償還。殆爲最後一次。亦即爲將來改訂戰債之條件。美國雖加否認。而英政府之意。確甚堅决。其他如意大利捷克。芬蘭。等五國。已步英國後塵。相繼還債。惟法國仍舊堅持。以爲賠欵戰債究屬不可分離。同時法國自羅馬尼亞猶哥斯拉夫。希獵。等國所應取得之數目。在一九三一年當時。乃有三千九百萬磅。而支付於英美者僅二千三百萬磅。則法國損失有一千六百萬磅之巨。去年亦如此數若以賠欵戰債相併合計。每年平均法國所得者。有五千一百二十萬磅。而支付則僅三千一百八十萬磅。如是則每年損失額。計有二千零十萬磅。法國於此决不能安然緘默。是以對美戰債。决不支付。而尾隨法國之後者。如比利時。如波蘭。如日斯多尼亞。等四國。均未支付到期戰債。於是此一問題。延擱至今。乃爲歐洲與美國間之巨大癌腫。至於如何切開。如何消解。端賴此次英美兩國當局會商之結果。</p>
<p>（四）軍備縮小</p>
<p>軍縮會議開會迄今。巳將一年。其成績無待煩述。英首相新近所提之新軍縮案。其未脫歷來窠臼。盡人皆知。東方見阻於日本之東洋門羅主義。西方受厄於法蘭西之﹁安全保障。﹂益以德意志﹁軍備平等﹂之要求。其實效已可槪見矣。</p>
<p>即以素好和平之美國而論。自九一八事變發生。上海戰爭續起。太平洋上航務。處處感受威脅。遂不得不集中大西洋艦隊於太平洋上。以備萬一不測之禍變。尤以美國前陸軍所屬航空軍司令官密其爾在下院陸軍委員會之提議。更爲露骨。其言曰。</p>
<p>﹃美國應新設國防部。把陸海空三軍都置諸一人統制之下。不消說美國的國防。要集中在太平洋。因爲那邊有一個世界的霸者而又極其頑强的國家控制其間。我和他們曾在西比利亞滿洲日本共過事。知道他抱有成吉思汗遠征的雄心。所以不問我們的心願如何。遲早總不能避免和他們衝突。所以美國在這種情勢之下。不充實空軍。是最失策的······﹄</p>
<p>證以美國之積極充實空軍。建造飛艇。即知此非過甚之語。日本之所謂軍備充實在表面固亟力避免戰爭之名而實際非但初年兵已送至熱河戰塲。且新設特别士官之規律。增加特務軍士。以補充下級將校之不足。其軍費之擴張。已明明爲戰時狀。態。其覇占赤道以北諸島嶼。强襲熱河。蹂躪灤東。窺伺多倫。均係有意挑戰之象徵。縱退一萬步言之。亦爲積極備戰。决無疑義。在此種零圍之中。美國而外尚有兩國。必須嚴重考慮其自身之立塲。第一爲英國。在遠東商業及投資關係。均極深遠。一旦日本之所謂東亞門羅主義形成。英國是否能甘心承受。第二蘇聯。正在向上發展。海參威乃遠東惟一海口。設使中東而被日晒剪斷者。其損失將如何彌補。同時英蘇之間。亦極不調和。對立之形。日漸顯著。此種對立的矛盾。終於無法消解。僅有任其擴大已耳。</p>
<p>總之。華盛頓英美法意德各國當政要人之會議。雖尚未正式開幕。結果自難預卜。然而徵諸史跡。證以上述諸端。各國均竭其心力於本國之繁榮。故對立之形勢。日趨嚴重。或者戰債可就此開闢新路。其他如世界經濟之復興。軍備之縮小。恐僅有虚文。難收實效。即對日制裁。亦不過一種輿論作用。最後淸算。終有待於實力之比賽也。</p>

<p>華盛頓會議</p>
<h3>美國凖備與各國締結互惠新商約</h3>
<p>保護稅則將廢除</p>
<p>提高銀價亦討論</p>
<p>日本重視此會議</p>
<p>國民社九日華盛頓電　美政府在數日内即將請國會調定新法案、其實際將等於授權總統、以互轟稅率代替保護稅則、惟美政府仍不欲徹除美國實業之藩籬、使受外國貨物、無攔阻之競爭、仍將用專門條約控制此種競爭、前次民主黨政　内即有訂結此項條約之保證、今自耶穌復活節後、各國執政與特使絡釋　止、即將開始討論締結新約問題、此後或須繼續商榷至六月一日、</p>
<p>據稱、民主黨此項計劃、其主要目的之一、在謀美國商工廠之徙歸本國、蓋自國會徵抽高關稅、他國亦施行報復稅、遂致製造商不得不設廠他國、以期在國外市場競爭、結果乃致美國之失業日增、今若藉互惠協定以擴充美貨海外市塲、而同時亦予他國貨物、尤其不與美國出産競爭之貨物、在美國市塲行銷之便利、可望美國工廠不再徙往國外、且或竟可以冀望其遷回本國、現有閣員數人、主張對於美國所不出産之貨物、完全免徵關稅、又有數人、則主張爲兼顧稅收計、徵極輕之稅、至將來此項談判是否將牽涉戰債、雖閣員與國會議員間罕有提及者、但料定爲與債務國會商時之重要議題云、</p>
<p>路透社九日華盛頓電　美國商會上書國務聊赫爾、謂債務國如能證明其未有還債能力、則國際債欵不妨暫時許其緩付、國會宜授權政府、准其談判作增進各國最好利益之協定、任何讓步、須以减輕債務國軍費爲依歸、商會希望美國堅持須有適當保護及充分條文、以應付不正當競爭之原則云、</p>
<h3>提高銀價方法</h3>

<p>路透十日紐約電　羅斯福總統現視加拿大在各國中爲美國最可與之談判互惠公約以作他國協定模範之國、加拿大首相邊納特候英相麥唐納到後、即將來游美京、美國擬與加拿大討論稅率及限制麥産事、阿眞廷亦將參加限制麥産之談話、蘇俄或亦可加入、現聞國務卿赫爾與英大使林德賽確曾談及金本位銀價及航業津貼等問題、赫爾並未要求英國立即恢復金本位、惟聞英大使亦承認穏定貨幣之需要、又聞赫爾對於英國責難美國津貼航業事、未表示同意、</p>
<h3>擬宋子文出席</h3>

<p>已轉電外部、微聞美政府邀請各國代表到美之意、係（一）觀察各國對經濟會議所討論各事項之態度、（一）交換對世界經濟復興問題之意見、以示美政府打開不景氣局面之决心、至美政府與各國代表問交換意見係各别舉行並無會議形式、</p>
<h3>日本擬派高橋</h3>
<p>日聯十日東京電　美國政府爲在華盛頓舉行世界經濟會議之預備交涉、對日本亦要求派遺代表、據出淵大使之報告、美國今次召集會議、其希望意見如下一·美國因希望世界經濟會議之成功、要求主要國先行開始預備交涉、二·各國所派代表、須有第一流人物之資格、以重預備交涉之意義、三·今次會議、除討論經濟財政問題外、解决爲世界經濟問題根本之戰債軍縮問題爲主要、故希望各國派首相級之人物、四·日本代表非但代表經濟會議、同時具備日美修好使節之資格、五·預備會議不取會議之形式、各國代表不必同時齊到華盛頓、日本代表可於五月底到美、</p>
<p>華聯十日東京電　日本實行退出國聯後、對外關係益趨孤立、國内民氣異常沉悶、爲鋒破此種環境、對世界經濟會議特别加以重視、其理由有如下幾點、一·運用世界經濟會議緩和國内經濟危機、二·計劃乘機提出僞國承認問題、三·利用此機鼓吹歐美各國對日滿投資、避免爲財政破産而不能達到對華侵略之目的、根據以上理由日政府欣然表示參加、且擬派國内第一流政治家參加該會、據日外務省息、日政府所推荐之候補者爲高橋財長、若高橋堅持不去、則另荐山本内相、倘兩元老均不願參加、將由重臣方面挑選有力代表赴會、如此足見日政府之用意云、</p>
<h3>紐約報紙好評</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯九日紐約電　紐約泰晤士報登載社論、對於世界經濟會議開會之前、華盛頓舉行談話尚未開始之局勢、加以研究、謂胡佛政府曾聲明、美國於世界經濟會議中、不允將戰債及關稅問題提出討論、此種態度引起各方非難僉謂此兩種最重要問題之途徑、已爲美國所阻塞、但羅斯福總統登台以後、情勢完全變更、羅氏願與各國討論關稅及戰債問題、其在商業上有關係之國家、亦邀請參加、世界經濟會議之﹁排演﹂、羅氏發動之後、各國外交家之艱鉅職責、當爲之利便不少也、向例他國政府輒先求本國之利益、然後使世國各國沾其餘潤、此次羅斯福總統一反他人所爲、而惟致力於大者遠者、此吾人所當額手稱慶也云云、</p>

<p>春秋貪多嚼不爛  賢賢　　我記得小時讀﹁大學之道，﹂自作聰明，硬要吃飽了墨水，遊不進泮水的西席老童生多敎些。老夫子把眼鏡一推鬍子一摸，露着一口焦黄編貝而言曰，﹁孺子可敎也，其如貪多嚼不爛何！﹂當時我心裏老大不舒服。　　隔了若干年，若干月，若干日，﹁貪多嚼不爛，﹂竟得了科學的證明。那時年少氣盛，甚麽都愛來一下子﹁我比你狠，﹂在同事之間，竟異想天開，舉行﹁吃飯比賽，﹂誰吃得多而且快，誰就保持着﹁吃飯香檳。﹂這比賽維持了十幾天，不得了，﹁虚懷若谷﹂的肚子，日漸臌脹，褲帶日漸嫌短，終於不得不高臥於醫院。醫生對我的肚子，研究了一番，斷定是害着不消化病，給我服下三大碗　繭油，大瀉三日，小瀉七日，洪福齊天，霍然而愈。出院之日﹁恩同再造﹂的醫生送給我一句﹁吃飯秘訣，﹂道，﹁少吃細嚼，不出毛病。﹂呀記起來了，失敬失敬，我家西席老童生，不愧爲十八世儒醫，竟　就發明了﹁貪多嚼不爛﹂的一片大道理。　　國家的領土，也是如此。民衆多的國家擁着廣大的領土，正如三百磅的大胖子，一頓飯吃七八碗，每天淸早放屁上坑，希鬆平淡。若是民衆不多的國家，硬要佔領廣大的領土，硬要佔領廣大的領土，那活像不滿一百磅的癆病鬼，拚命的一餐塞進七八碗，雖不至於一時三刻，嗚呼哀哉，但，﹁中焦阻滯，﹂是用不到烏龜壳占卜而可預知的。　中國丢了東北幾省，正可﹁少吃細嚼，﹂有益衛生。﹁我之瘠，人之肥也。﹂我知必有因﹁貪多嚼不爛，﹂而抬進世界病院者。試猜誰將害不消化病，中者有獎，儲欵以待，决計食言。量大福大  靜谿　　我們上海人有句俗語，呌做﹁量大福大﹂，意思是量氣越大，吃些虧不放在心上的人，福氣也越大。﹁宰相肚裏好撑船﹂，就是這個道理。　　眞的，我們大中國的量可不算小了。以前皇帝伯伯和各國訂下了不少條約；奉送海口要隘之外，還屢次賠上了幾萬萬兩雪白的銀子。不論來者是碧眼兒，木屐兒，一視同仁，愛什麽拿什麽，省得多麻煩。好在中國地大物博，喪失一些如九牛之亡一毛；一方面同小人計較，也犯不着，馬馬虎虎算了。　　畢竟皇帝伯伯氣量大，福也大，所以﹁埀拱而天下治﹂。到民國就不對了，縱然有幾個人想從中取利，甘心賣國，祇好偷偷摸摸的私幹，還給人唾駡。到現今可更不對了，東洋人來佔了一些士地，大家劍拔弩張，怒目而視，和他拚起命來。弄得大家不安，自討苦吃。實在是把量放大些，由他搶了去罷！　　退一步想，我們的土地正在着，物産正多着，失去一些算不了什麽。尤其在關内的我們，有吃有穿；靑的山，綠的水，花花世界：正享不盡的繁華綺麗，過不完的良辰美景。索性把關門緊閉，屁股向着他們，且自快樂逍遙，倒來得安定些。　　我們現在是有不少的寳藏埋在地下，一旦開放出來，儘可以用之不盡，取之不竭。我們祖宗傳下了四百兆同胞，不管智，愚，賢，不肖，子孫之多，家産之大，都足以顧盼自豪！　　如果量狹一些，刀對刀，槍對槍，打得頭破血流。打勝了還好，打敗了給鄰人笑話。索性他來我讓；他要打，我快走。像公子哥兒，喝酒跳舞，這些事不放在心上，﹁量大福大﹂，到底没有吃虧的地方的。酒  鄭楚堯　　已經是整整地十三週年不曾爽快喝酒的美國民衆，靠着總統羅斯福的福，從四月七日零時一分鐘起，人人都能開懷暢飲了！這在美國酒徒的心靈中，是該如何樣雀躍的一件事呢！　　一提起﹁酒﹂那樣東西，我是十二分的懷疑，爲什麽在那觥籌交錯中的那班酒徒，會那樣的歡聲鼎沸，快樂非凡，我曾這樣去詢問我的一個酒朋友，那朋友告訴我的是：﹁酒中是别有天地，在酒中是能獲到你心的安慰，﹂於是在某一個心境愁悵苦悶到極點的一個黄昏，我是一個兒跑進了酒樓，我是滿懷着在酒裏能獲到我心的安慰，結果是舉杯消愁愁更愁！因爲在每一杯酒裏，它都告訴我一件悲酸的往事；每杯酒裏，它都告訴我關於人生的飄渺；最使人要痛心的在每一杯酒裏，它都有一個淸晰的影子現於我飽含酸涙的眼裏，那便是我已逝世了四年的慈母的影子，當我一隻脚跨出酒樓門檻的時候，我不自覺地放聲痛哭了！因爲我已被這别人認爲甜湯的﹂酒一將我的心靈殘摧得幾乎碎了！　　在兩個月之前吧！我雖明知﹁酒﹂是會摧殘自己的心靈的，但，我是仍然應允了一個朋友的邀請，重進了酒樓；這一次，我是意外的體會到﹁酒﹂的偉大了！因爲酒那樣神秘的東西，它能使我平日如鼠小般的胆，突然，變得雄壯得像鋒鐵般堅强；在我平日敬之如神還不足的上司，在酒後，我是痛快地駡了他一頓；這便是﹁酒﹂的偉大，它能夠使我說平日所不敢說的話。長篇小說東北四連長  張恨水　　第四回情局復開茶寮傾積愫年關難渡質庫作哀鳴　　舊式的姑娘，對於婚事，一没有表示，這就是承認了。這樣看起來，江氏猜姑娘的心事，那算没有猜錯，於是就可以向本問題進行了。因微笑道：我那路上那裏又有什麽相當的姑娘呢······桂枝突然將臉一板，將懷裏抱住在作的衣服，向下一摔，望了母親道：您這不是多說這幾句話。誰請您作媒來着？誰求您作媒來着？没有相當的姑娘，就没有相當的姑娘，這要您找個什麽急？眞是聽評書吊涙，替古人擔憂。他說完了這話，臉上是紅中帶靑，那氣就生大了。江氏明明是覺得姑娘會贊成的，倒不料會生這樣大的氣。一時轉不過彎來，也就無話可說。許久的功夫，才淡淡的道：你這是怎麽啦，憑我說這樣一句話，你就生這樣大的氣。桂枝道：本來嗎？我又不是說媒拉　的，給一個大姑娘家，說這些話作什麽？江氏因姑娘如此頂撞他，也有氣了，便重聲道：大姑娘怎麽着？那個作大娘的人，都是從做姑娘來的。我這樣說幾句，你也把不上生氣。難道說你就眞跟我過一輩子不嫁人。再說，我這樣大歲數了，今天脫了鞋和襪不知明天穿不穿，有一天我死了，你怎麽辦呢？桂枝道？您别那樣繞着脖子和我說話，當軍人的人，我總是不樂意的。他說這話，態度表示非常的激昻，氣勃勃的來遮蓋着伊的羞態。江氏一看這樣子，知道伊是决不肯嫁趙自强的了，自己說也是白說，只好不作聲，母女這一段談話，在無法繼續的情形之下，就突然中止了。因爲如此，自第二日起，桂枝爲避了嫌疑起見，决不跨過後頭院子門一步，就是遇見了趙自强回來，也僅僅是和他點個頭，一句閑話也不肯說。但是在每日下午，在甘積之要由河工局回家來的時候，桂枝必定走到大門口來，向甘家門口望上一望。望了三天，居然就遇到積之了。（三八）上海大舞塲  希宗　　記記得去年的今日，砲火毁滅後的春天，大上海從瓦礫丘中蘇醒過來。笙歌又起，膩舞再現：於是我追隨了一羣酒肉朋友，走向辣斐德路的西端，三個月來的靜寂，換得今夜的陶醉，呵，我恍然，我淪落的靈魂啊！　　這夜，使我永遠不能忘懷的一夜呀丨這是最初，我開始認識了上海是罪惡之都，不，誘惑之市，出賣靈魂的所在！　　呵！這是上海大舞塲。　　經過了曲折的園徑，跑進了圖案的屋子；在神秘而帶有誘惑的年紅燈下，動人心炫的音樂中，我陷入肉香與粉香的氛圍，我的心靈巳飄蕩，我的肌肉已麻木；這裏，祇有享樂：没有悲哀，祇有歡笑：没有流涙，怎不使我整個的身兒沉醉？　　我吃着杯中剩餘的可可，回顧四週的坐位已空。望到中央的塲面；五色續纷的花紙撒瀉於空中，穿着大禮服的紳士們，披着蕩人靈魂衣衫的舞女們；一對對的男女在起舞，一個個的氣球在飛飄；還有爵士音樂的節奏，皮鞋聲的旋律；以及，顫動的乳房，············怎不使我的靈魂麻醉？脚兒奇癢？假若我也會起來作狐步之舞，也一定會去挽住懷春少女的腰，享度這惱人的春宵。但是我回看的中的夜報，呵！我怔住，你們這般在火山上跳舞的人呀！有一天。這火山爆發的一天，要使你們捲入火之漩渦呢！丨迷離的瞑想蕩漾在我的心底。　　呵！我恍然，我已認識了是這樣的上海大舞塲。小說夢裏的亡國奴生活  姚學誠　　我似乎是住在北方沿海的一個Ｘ鎭上丨丨比縣城還大Ｘ鎭，四圍有無邊的鹽田，有無數的人羣。　　鎭上的十字式街道又長，又闊，更熱閙，商店裏出賣的一大半是仇貨，國貨不多，還夾着一小部份的來路貨。　　我的地位很高，好像是已故鹽商×××的兒子，有財，有勢，但是從小就不愛讀書，所以到現在五五二十五歲、不會寫一篇放屁文章，這也不在話下。　　我家裏奴僕成羣，倉廪堆積如山，横豎請着人管理，不消自己費心，倒也安閒自在，只是有一件不稱心，爺娘瞎了烏龜眼，没有研究優生學，落地就長得一副壞嘴臉，旣黑且麻，到這時身子長才不滿四尺，可恨！可惱！　　大爺一有了錢，誰不奉承！三個標緻細娘輪流的伴着我睡覺，都異口同聲的稱讚我漂亮，照鏡，啊，不成，醜得很！　　走到街上，娘們瞧見了我，一笑，都　足跑開了，男的祇好背地裏暗笑，當着面，哼，給他兩記耳光，誰敢！　　鎭上也有維持地方治安的保衛團，我每月捐助三千兩白銀，槍不到一百枝，大刀，長槍，鐵棍，鋼义，連廟裏祭神用的傢伙都掮了去攏而統之，毛賊就未必怕，去嚇他媽！團了，不消說，個個都是些頂天立地的好漢，不僅是好漢，簡直是精靈，精靈有什麽要緊，匪來了，躺在舗上抽大烟，抵敵麽？犯不上犧牲窮性命，樂得過癮。　　﹁哎哟，不不不······好了！東東東洋人打打打得來了！﹂一天，我的一個貼身小使皮三郎，氣急敗壞的奔來報告。　　﹁逃！逃！逃！逃！﹂我立刻下一個比﹁殺！殺！殺！殺！﹂的衝鋒還急上萬倍的命令。　　一陣子亂，金銀財寶，裝滿了十大騾車，我騎馬領路，很像一字長蛇陣，不管羊腸曲徑，或是山道崎嶇，都銜枚捷走，浩浩蕩蕩的去逃命。　　烏雲吞了落日，昏黑的天。　　﹁碰！﹂睡倒了一匹騾馬，我縮做一團，勒住絲轡，仔細望前面瞧，唉，不淸楚，怎辦？　　﹁大萊狄司介！﹂我懂得了，這是東洋話，不是土匪打的術語，糟糕！糟糕！　　天啊！壯一壯我的膽子吧！我立刻不自覺的膽子果然壯起來了，於是集中我的視線，眼前一𦊫一𦊫的盡都是東洋人了，啊喲！不對！怎麽？頭上生尖角，牙齒突出唇外尺把長，眼腔裏冒出火焰來的鬼怪是東洋人嗎？噢對了，東洋人才是吃人的魔鬼呢！　　我不敢迫視了，身子竦竦的抖，像打板子，回馬便逃，十大車財寶，算給了兒子吧！逃命要緊，他們倒也不追趕，回家躱藏起來，屋子又多，又大，藏在壁柜裏，怕什麽！　　回家了，好險！點一點人數，走失了一個標緻細娘　丨金鳳丨丨二姨太，還有皮三郎那厮，不去查究他們了，好小子！算你交運，天有眼睛，報在東洋人的身上，把這一雙姦夫淫婦抓去砍成肉餅子才稱心，慢着，東洋人不來追趕，没理由，大槪他們是在半路分贓了，心痛得幾乎暈倒在地上，天哪，眞没辦法！</p>

<p>自由談行矣張少帥  幸之　　二十幾年來的中國政治，眞像走馬燈，我們眼看着吳大帥倒了，又眼看着孫馨帥倒了，但倒了一個，又來一個，循環起伏，相承相生，現在，趁着擴大會議時期的絶好時機而闖進關内，高據華北统治寶座的張少帥，聽說又將於今天悄然出國了。﹁大江東去，浪淘盡千古風流人物，﹂這一齣政治悲喜劇，不到﹁軍閥政治﹂結束，我想，一時决還不會演到﹁尾聲﹂。　　海天遼闊，一舟浮沉，在康脫魯素輪上，誰知道我們的少帥會興起怎樣的感觸呢？但，回味往日的風流韻事，回顧春意濃郁的北平古城，而今風流散盡，寶座亦已屬於他人，也許我們的少帥會臨流高唱﹁問君還有幾多愁，恰似一江春水向東流﹂而﹁日以滬洗面﹂罷。　　尤其令我們的少帥掃興的是：少帥在上海的庽所，居然有人敢抛擲炸彈；旅英的僑胞，居然敢來電擋駕，甚至說出﹁請爲祖國稍留體面﹂的不堪入耳的話；少帥隨手帶走願和園幾件古字畫，叵耐張繼居然敢通電請求扣留；少帥出賣了一所海軍醫院，海軍部也居然敢聲言反對。還有，歐美各國吸幾口××，打幾針××，竟没有中國這樣自由，更累得我們的少帥不得不﹁戒除嗜好﹂，因而精神萎頓，甚至神志皆迷。假使是在往日的話，哼，莫說是出賣一所海軍醫院，帶走幾件古字畫，東北半壁山河不是我們的少帥親手讓諸日人的嗎？曾有誰人敢向少帥算賬呢？﹁時衰鬼弄人﹂，剛下台便迎頭碰着許多不如意的事，少帥，少帥，亦可哀矣！　　然而，聽說少帥臨走時，曾將華北三月份軍政各費順便掃數提走，這筆欵子，大槪也還可觀，而且東北半壁河山自我而失，雖不能﹁留芳﹂，也還可以﹁遺臭﹂，少帥應亦可以﹁自豪﹂，至於祖宗坵墓所在與﹁老帥﹂造體所寄的桑梓之邦，於少帥固何有？當然不值我們的少帥之一顧。　　行矣張少帥，歐洲的﹁美人﹂們在等待着你，跳舞塲在等待着你，高爾夫球塲在等待着你，一切的歡樂，（除了阿片之類以外）都在等待着你，祖國，破碎的祖國，有什麽值得你留戀呢？　　行矣張少帥，到了歐洲以後，我想，你總會快樂地高呌：﹁此間樂，不思中國也﹂罷！國貨年  朱雯　　年紅燈在夜空裏循流着鮮艶的血液：無綫電在放送着流行的雷夢娜；白竹布紅字的市招兒在跳着狐步舞；什麽樓的窗口衝出了一陣德國惠士忌的怪味兒，銜着吉士牌香烟的國貨商人在奥斯汀六汽缸轎車裏嚷着這是國貨年。　　小本經紀的商人也銜着大英牌香烟在嚷着這是國貨年；一家國貨布廠的老　撚着兩撇仁丹鬚兒在經理室裏踱步，計劃着布匹的花樣，計劃着布匹的銷路；啊，男的女的，穿的是國貨了，用的是本廠的布匹。年紅燈的光雨灑落在翻新的花樣上，雷夢娜的音波一粒粒的篩下來，市招兒是咱家的出品咧，什麽酒家的轉門裏吐出來的可不全是穿着咱家出品的衣料？這年頭兒是﹁國貨﹂的，於是兩撇仁丹鬚兒下也泛出了一縷國貨的微笑。　　﹁這是國貨年，趕快多打幾個新的布樣兒罷！﹂老閭對打樣的說。　　﹁這是國貨年，趕快多織幾匹布罷！﹂老閭對機間裏的女工說。　　女工們心裏在說：﹁多織幾匹布，多算幾個錢罷。﹂但是有的在想，這年頭讓他多嫌幾個錢，以後好加些兒工錢。打樣的心裏也在想，讓這花樣兒好銷，多領幾個賞錢吧。　　十匹百匹，各種花式的布匹兒從機間搬進了貨房，老閭瞧住了這些出神；心裏在想：有咱發了國貨財的一天，你打樣的多給幾個賞錢，你管機的加些兒工錢是不用請求的。　　布匹兒堆滿了貨房。過了一個多月的時光了，但貨房裏布匹還是那麽滿啊。　　老閭的兩撇鬚兒下面漸漸没有國貨的微笑了：他間跑街的爲什麽銷不了貨。跑街的苦笑着說：　　﹁這是個國貨年，可是這年頭兒的國貨太多了。﹂　　年紅燈在夜空裏畫着國貨年，無線電在放送着國貨年的演說，白竹布市招兒上的﹁國貨年﹂三個大紅字在電光下招人，什麽樓的窗口裏飛出了許多國貨商人讌會的譁笑；銜着吉士牌香烟的一個商人踱出了酒樓，急急地鑽進了一輛六汽　　缸奥斯汀轎車裏，心裏惦記着今夜上岸的五千疋東洋花標。　　布廠的老閭在經理室裏撚着鬚，踱着步，計畫着：還是進它五百包洋紗吧。靑田商人  子久　　凡是從歐洲回來的留學生，一提起靑田商人，大槪没有一個不感到頭痛的。六年前，我和烈文同船赴歐時，船一開，我們便注意到四等艙裏四五十個洋服穿得狠壞的工人模樣的中國人。他們都是矮個子，面目黧黑，說着滿口難懂的方言。那時歐戰結束已經好些年了，﹁飛鳥盡，良弓藏﹂，我們祇偶爾從報纸上見到遣送失業華工或勤工儉學生回國的消息，並没有聽到再有招僱華工的事，所以當時見着大批工人赴歐，頗使我們驚詫。後來在那四五十個言語不通的同胞裏面，找着了一個能說幾句普通話的人，攀談起來，才知道他們都是浙江靑田人，他們不是到歐洲去做工，而是到歐洲去經商。　　經商！他們旣不懂得句外國話，又絶不像是富有資本的商人，到外國做買賣是這樣容易的事嗎？我們當時便問他在歐洲開着什麽寶號，做着什麽生意。但那位先生普通話旣太不高明，並且也像不願意多說似的，我們的問話没有得着滿意的答覆。　　一路上，幾十個靑田人，在我們三等艙的留學生看來，簡直是謎似的人物。船上散步的地方是有限制的，三等客人散步的地方，掛着有法文牌子，不許四等艙裏的人上去，但這牌子在那些靑田人眼中没有發生效力，開船後頭兩天，他們常常跑上三等客人散步的地方來，被茶房頭法國人看見了，用脚兜着屁股往下趕，那情形，狠使我們旁觀的中國人難受。　　四等艙裏除掉這些靑田人外，還有幾十個由天津上海等處撤回馬賽的法國兵。這些洋丘八老爺在天津上海的租界上把中國人欺侮慣了，在船上當然要繼續欺侮那些靑田人，好幾次惹得烈文的同鄉湖南人Ｃ君暴跳如雷，跑下去替他們打抱不平，差點兒閙出事情。　　後來到了歐洲，和朋友談起，才知道這些靑田人是華僑裏面最活動的份子。别的中國人如留學生之類，都是到外國來送錢的，只有這些靑田人却是到外國來賺錢寄回中國的。他們有狠懺密的組織，歐洲各國差不多都有他們的足迹。新來的靑田人，祇要把﹁先生﹂，﹁太太﹂，﹁小姐﹂和一，二，三，四，五······的數碼字學會了，便可提着籃子上街做生意。他們刻苦耐勞，過着極簡單的生活，把賺下的錢儘往故鄉寄，聽說靑田一縣，每年由他們從外國匯回的現金總在百萬元以上。　　但他們究竟做的什麽生意呢？說來可憐，却盡是推銷日本貨的小販！他們以狠廉的批發價從日本商人手裏取到一些人造珠或玻璃項圈，糊着花紙的小竹簾之類，放在籃子裏面，立在公共市塲或通衢大道，向人兜售；也有用小提箱盛着這類東西，每天跑馬路，沿門求賣的。我在歐洲的幾年留學期間，無論是名都大市，窮鄉僻壞，遊踪所至，總見到有一兩個這樣呌化子似的靑田商人。　　因爲他們衣履寒酸，面目猥瑣，舉止卑陋，他們到處都受人輕視，嘲弄；他們自己雖處之泰然，好像毫無感覺，但一班留學生則以爲有辱國體，看見他們就要轉路。無論他們的勇敢和奮鬥精神怎樣值得佩服，他們却免不了要受着異國人和自己的同胞的厭惡！蘧廬絮語  子展　　（十六）茶酒論　　頃讀劉復博士敦煌掇瑣上輯，中有茶酒論一卷，題鄉貢進士王敫撰。卷尾署開寳三年，壬申歲，正月十四日，知術院弟子閻海眞自手書記。按開實爲宋太祖年號，開寳三年（西元九七○）爲庚午，五年始爲壬申　記者誤也。文託茶酒爭功，各自誇炫，水爲排解，而茶酒厭服。稱之爲論，母寜名賦，實則可列入韻文小說一類。語頗通俗，而意甚詼諧，惜傳鈔多訛，不可盡曉。煞尾水勸茶酒云：﹁從今已後，切須和同。酒店發富，茶坊不窮。長爲兄弟，須得始终。若人讀之一本，永世不害酒顛茶風。﹂可以想見全文風趣之一斑。此文殆出於中唐或五代人之手，宋初猶甚流行民間歟？予謂飲茶之習，盛自中唐，茶酒等埒，乃有託爲爭論之文也。唐封演封氏聞見記，謂南人好飲茶，北人初不多飲。開元中，泰山靈巖寺有降魔師大興禪，敎學禪，務於不寐，又不夕食，皆許其飲茶，人自懷挾，到處煑飲，從此轉相倣傚，遂成風俗。自鄒齊滄棣，漸至京邑，城市多開店舗，煎茶賣之，不問道俗，投錢取飲。其茶自江淮而來，舟車相繼，所在山積。蓋魏晋六朝之際，飲茶之俗尚未曁於北方。後魏楊衒之洛陽伽藍記，載魏中大夫楊元愼譏梁使陳慶之云﹁吳人之鬼，居住建康，菰蒲爲飯，茗飲爲漿。﹂此北人初不飲茶之證也。迨至盛唐，北人飲茶亦寢成風俗矣。中唐之時，旣有貢茶之例，又設榷茶之稅。什一而征，年收茶稅至四十萬緡，可見茶商驟盛，而嗜茶者盈天下也。陸羽生於其時，遂成嗜茶之聖。新唐書陸羽傳云：﹁羽嗜茶，著經三篇，言茶之原之法之具尤備，天下益知飲茶矣。時鬻茶者至陶羽形，置煬突間，祀爲茶神。﹂至茶神出，而茶在民間成爲周編之嗜好，驟與酒相等埓，此茶酒論之所以出于其時歟？長篇創作時代與愛的歧路  張資平　　﹁你是我的嫂嫂啊！﹂﹁哈，哈，哈！不敢當！﹂　　她的笑聲是很不自然的，兼含有怒懟和反抗的成分。他說笑般的稱贊了她的胸部輪廓的美麗，但給她笑着駡了一陣，她駡他不莊重，没規矩。他臉紅紅地退下去了。　　﹁老曹還不回來，我要出去了。﹂﹁你不在家裏吃飯？﹂﹁請你們飲茶去好麽？﹂﹁那再好没有。﹂　　她笑了，同時立起身，像是想準備一下外出的裝束。海泉想，請他們上館子，有三種原因可以呌她喜歡。第一，當然是可以吃得更好的飯菜，第二，於她的家庭經濟有益，第三，她可以節省一點勞働。　　﹁我們就走吧﹂。海泉催促她。﹁再等一刻好麽？看他回來不回來﹂。海泉想，她到底還是曹世光的妻子。他走下去看了一下二房東的時鐘，還只是十一點欠十分。他也覺得還早一點，便忍耐着等。她此刻很不客氣地在他面前脫去了家常的便服，換穿上了出外的新裝。　　﹁這才漂亮﹂！他故意稱贊了她一聲。﹁竟不知道你這樣的不老實﹂。她笑着睨視了他一下。當她走到鏡台前去重施脂粉時，好奇心又促他走過去立在她的身後。他望着鏡裏面的她，只是傻笑。她也向着鏡裏面的他做鬼臉，他當時便起了一陣微妙的感觸。他覺得這樣的經騐給了他以一個快慰。他知道這在未婚者是不能享受的。他怱然衝動地伸出隻腕來，輕輕地加到她的肩背上了。看見她一點也不抵抗，他似乎獲得了一些快感。但他不會有更進一步的表示。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刋電影專刋電影專刊好萊塢不景氣中我國影業的好機會  姚寅仲　　電影關係民族文化的前途，是很重大的，不僅是供人們的娱樂而巳。我們中國，以前只是一個外國影片市場的尾閭，每年輸出的金錢，爲數亦殊可驚。至於外國片之輸入我國者，當以美國好萊塢居多數。但自從經濟恐慌的惡潮衝破了那向稱﹁金元王國﹂以後，好萊塢也蒙了影響，於是影片之經營者，不得不實行緊縮政策，因之有減少演員們薪水之舉。　　這一來，以後美國的影片，出産也許要隨之而減少了；雖則還有其他國家的影片（如德國烏發等）可以取而代之，但其勢力還趕不上美國。况其他國家也同樣遭逢着不景氣，以後也未必能多多出産影片的了。　　落後的我國電影業，際此時會，正是天賜的振作努力的大好機會，不知我國之一般經營此業者，也有此感覺，也有此願望乎？　　於此，我得竭其肫摯之忱，忠告我國電影業一句話；我們如其不欲乘此謀擴展則已，否則必須檢查過去的缺點，以爲眼前努力之標的。今請將我感覺到的缺點申說一下：　　第一，影片的材料，不是﹁陳腐﹂，就是﹁惡濫﹂。影片的材料，是影片的生命所繫，一種影片之有否價值，要看它有無生命以爲定；因爲電影亦是一種藝術，藝術是有生命的東西。﹁陳腐﹂或﹁惡濫﹂的影片，已落了﹁幼稚﹂的窠臼，不能受一般人的讚賞，即使有一部份對電影常識缺乏的人們歡迎着，讚賞着，也不過是一時的現象。這種影片，就是没有生命的東西；經營電影業者，以後取材必須力避這兩種弊病，而要從﹁新頴﹂上打算。所謂﹁新頴﹂的材料者，無他，就是要有﹁時代性﹂而已。這時代是什麽時代，這時代需要什麽樣的影片，就取什麽材料。切切不可只顧賺錢，而忘却了自身所負有的使命。　　第二，演員没有涵養，演員的好歹，實在關係片子的生命至大，凡是好的演員，必定是對於電影有充分的涵養的，他們就能夠維繫得住這片子的生命。我國電影演員之缺少涵養，實爲不可諱，無庸諱的事實；即使現下有幾個所謂﹁明星﹂也者，亦不過是捧出來的。須知外國的電影演員，都是有他們眞實的演作技能的，雖有捧塲的人，但絶不專靠人家捧。　　假使我們能夠在上面所說的兩點上，切實地去努力反省，改造，那麽，在外國影片界不景氣之中，才有出頭的希望，才能替﹁國産影片﹂爭氣；要是一味地抱着趁這機會以與外國片爭生意的觀念，而忘了片子本身的優劣，丨丨只顧賺錢，而不顧片子的價值，那是自棄其人格，自毁其名譽，是萬萬要不得的，而且過後也不會有好結果的。願我國電影界勉之！勉之！珍重努力！（却酬）影片談評評﹁故劍難忘﹂ＴhericharealＷaysＷithus  凌鶴　　導演平庸表演尚佳　　像這樣的電影，總算是上層階級生活的素描。在他們的生活中，愛情的巴戲，當然也是不能缺少的花樣。在這張片中，一個交際花因自己的丈夫和另一女人有了曖昧行爲，而且居然和那女人結了婚，於是她在和丈夫離婚之後，也就和另一男人實行勾搭。但她和丈夫總還割不斷所謂夫妻情分，所以矛盾的心情確是苦了她，一直到一方面和新丈夫結婚，而又同時爲舊丈夫服侍疾病。　　本來一部以内心描寫爲主的影片，是很可以使演員賣力而又不易成功的，在這一部影片中，我們正可以得着充分的證明。然而這是指導演平庸者而言，假如有了好的導演，能夠攫住劇本的重心，那末至少總應當有其精采的地方。但是本片的導演，却正没有很好的方法來描寫這種劇情，他祗能呆笨的僅僅着重在主角身上，而不能夠在其他方面抓着較好的配襯。假如我們承認主角交際花的行動是值得同情的，那末至少她的前夫總多少是值得愛戀的。所以我們必須在她前夫的身上能夠更好的描寫，這樣才能使交際花痛苦的心情得以充分的表現出來，否則任是主角如何賣力，终於不能給觀衆何等的印象。而且他對於全篇的體系，亦没有很好的聯繫，觀衆必須充分注意到每一句對白才能明白劇情的進展。當然，這不僅是剪接的問題，而是導演過於注意聲片的優點，而忽視了電影所固有的形式。然而導演的聰明，我們在許多小地方總還看得出來，如Ｊulian之抱着電話聽筒睡覺，Ｃaroline之不忍損壞相片，房門外的别針，以及房中的一夜！纏綿的鏡頭。但是僅是如此，到底是非常不夠的吧。　　如上所述，我們知道劇本結構之鬆懈而勉强，也是很顯然的事實。一個交際花對於自己的愛情，雖然不一定都是過於隨便。但是她那一無所長的前夫，爲什麽會值得她如此戀戀不捨呢？而且她爲什麽對於那樣的一個後夫會如此迷惑的呢？而且又是如此鬆懈，不能直接以畫面告訴觀衆劇情之進展。即在意義上說，除了對於這一羣人，畫了一個單純的輪廓以外，不能告訴觀衆任何比較有深意的用心。他們或她們除了整天飲酒賭博以外，還需要在愛情中鬼混，如此而已。　　然而露絲蔡德頓（ＲuthＣhatterton）的表演倒是好的，她很能逼眞的描摹所謂交際花一流的女人。雖然因爲導演不好，在劇中没有能夠給她充分發展的機會可是她總還過得去的。可惜相同的動作比較的多，同時面部表情亦覺不夠。其餘如ＧeorgeＢrent也還可以。所以本片的表演，總算尚佳。觀衆意見看了國魂後的感慨  于一淸　　也許是我的見識淺薄；在影片裏從來没見到這般揚眉吐氣的描寫。今天在﹁國魂﹂裏給我一個賞識丁：啊！這是多麽痛快的一回事呢！　　處於現代帝國主義者壓迫下之弱小民族們，如果能學像該片中丨丨鐵木耳丨丨的一半氣息，也夠他一生豪爽的受用了！　　這片裏有﹁世界人類的同情性﹂、介紹﹁女性的呐喊﹂楊脩　　沈西苓編劇兼導演　　﹁女性的呐喊﹂的劇本故事，大概是描寫一個小有産者的女學生，芳名葉運的，在求學時代，志趣高超，希望也非常遠大；可是不久就受了意外的打擊，使得她家破人亡，剩下她和稚弱的妹妹兩個。此後爲生活所迫，她就開始踏進了社會。﹁女性的呐喊﹂裏所描寫的，就是葉蓮在社會環境的黑暗勢力中困苦奮鬥的一葉血涙史。　　演員方面，飾葉蓮的是王瑩。男主角是龔稼農。除了他們倆，還有一位主角，是小明星張敏玉。　　沈西苓君的導演影片，我們知道是第一次；王瑩上銀幕也是破天荒的，這兩位新人合作的﹁處女片﹂，不管他成績怎樣，想總能給與觀衆以一點﹁新﹂的意味吧？﹁女性的呐喊﹂之一幕　　﹁思想落伍的頽唐者﹂，﹁熱血流露的本色﹂，﹁冠冕虚僞的内層﹂。但可惜不映到到自甘屈伏的僞皇帝那邊去：或映給那誤國賣國，不抵抗的軍閥們去看，不然，多少也可踢醒他幾分傀儡夢，提醒他幾分﹁人的﹂心。（缺章却酬）祇有奮鬥纔能翻身  阿麟　　蘇俄出品，大導演家普符特金氏傑作，經各電影刋物長久介紹的﹁亞洲風雲﹂已在我們眼前展示了，正如諸評影家所說，它確是張不可多得的巨片。　　它顯示出那愚弱民族們的不良習慣風俗，及它們所結的惡果，同時把帝國主義者奸猾，刁詐，僞虚的行爲與策略揭破；侵略者萬惡，殘酷，兇狠的手段與壓力暴露；把壓迫者猙獰的面目，罪惡赤裸裸，一絲絲，痛快的撕揭，顯露出來（這些是在鍍金的片子上絶跡的）；它爲被壓迫的弱小民族開一生活，指示着非奮鬥反抗無以求生存，昏迷馴服是只有自促毁滅與淪亡。　　全劇的演出有若一滿裝火藥的炸彈，始由酋長之子反抗喇嘛爲導火線，終於在極度緊張醖釀中延至傀儡王子覺醒時大爆發，弱小民族們呀！只有奮鬥，反抗才能翻身；小可打倒一切暴壓，榨取！這啓示，這鼓勵尤其是本劇的力量，的最大成功處。所見四種意義  則人　　關於這張片子的藝術，我是門外漢，祇好讓之於影評專家們去批評，我想說的是關於這張片子的意義。　　在這裏，第一點她告訴了我們帝國主義的侵略，連在沙漠荒野的蒙古都有了他們的足跡。可見帝國主義的侵略好似水銀瀉地一般，無孔不入。　　第二她告訴了我們帝國主義對於落後的弱小民族是如何刻薄的　取他們的血汗，是如何凶很的對待落後的蒙古人。他們簡直草管人命，任意捕捉蒙古人來槍斃。　　第三她告訴了我們帝國主義和弱小民族的國家的統治階級總是勾結的。统治蒙古的除掉什麽親王之外，便算是所謂喇嘛了。然而帝國主義和他們的交往是非常的親密，他們之間簡直打成一片。　　第四，他告訴了我們帝國主義不僅用他們自己的力量維護他們的侵略，他們還要在落後的弱小民族中建立一個傀儡的政權，做他們的工具，來維護他們的權益。正可爲我們借鏡  培元　　大約是三年前這張蘇俄影片﹁國魂﹂，在首都大戲院開映。那時首都的人民都被它轟動，全市的輿論界皆一致的讚美，有的竟盡義務出特刋來替它宣傳。昨天我又到明珠復看了一次，現在：特簡單地略述如後：　　﹁亞州風雲﹂是一部暴露帝國主義者壓迫弱小民族的影片，全片將帝國主義者的獰狰的本來凶面目，似水銀瀉地無孔不入般的暴露無遺。可是不甘永久屈服受帝國主義者的壓迫蹂躪懸殊地起來反抗了。結果，弱小民族終於用血肉的軀體；偉大團結的力量；在狂風暴雨中摧敗了帝國主義者。全劇是包含着激烈！慷慨！悲壯！使我們的情緒緊張起來，眞的，這一部﹁亞州風雲﹂，無疑地可說是爲我們現在國家所處的環境一幅寫照畫，是一部弱小民族反抗帝國主義侵略壓迫的革命光榮史，所以這部片子與我國國家有莫大的裨益，凡是中國的人民皆應去一看，最後：我不禁要大聲的呐喊一聲，負有一切重大使命責任的中國電影界，你們也應該仿効這部有剌激性，有愛國思想的影片攝製吧！意識殊佳景物偉大  森　　從劇本本身上，我們可以看出主旨是在發揚弱小民族反抗壓迫階级的精神。當鐵木耳在宫中狂衝時，大聲呼喊着﹁我給你們看看我們的力量！﹂這都表示出反抗强權的眞精，並且是基於大衆的力量：　　全片演出，實在生動緊張。以演員論，鐵木耳表作俱佳，特别是在後半部狂衝時，使觀衆神之所及，幾忘呼吸。司令官也很逼眞，裝威嚴，扮虚僞，恰得其宜。至於其餘演員，全能各盡其職。景物方面，很能一新滬人眼目，如冰河，如雪山，如狂沙，如暴風，雪野，······由此更襯出寒帶人民的剛勇好門。光線方面，大概因爲片子開演過多稍有糢糊處，似爲美中不足耳。總之，該片已然得到它的成功，戲迷萬勿錯過機會。亞洲風雲正緊，該片尤可爲我人借鏡。暮鼓晨鐘當頭棒喝  周敬之　　亞洲風雲原名﹁國魂﹂，在二年前在上海已映過，是很平常的一張影片。可是經過嚴格的修剪之後，却洋洋乎大觀了。劇情賜給我們是如何地興奮，剌激，偉大，我們感覺在這生命線動搖下，只有拚命，才有光明的前途！只有奮鬭，才能圖生存。　　在這中國山河破裂，國將不國的時期，﹁亞洲風雲﹂是值得我們看的，尤其是靑年。我相信這是我們的暮鼓晨鐘當頭棒喝。嘉寳决入麥高美  康冰　　麥高美公司現已正式宣佈，葛雷泰嘉寳已與該公司簽訂合同。準於四月一日起開始工作。惟攝製之地點，因現在美國勞工局對於外籍明星限制問題，漸趨嚴重，故尚未决定，大約祇有在瑞典攝製了。此新片已决定爲Ｃhristina係一則十七世紀時政治的故事，現已由華爾忒璜格着手編排。電影小說賽珍會ＳtateＦair（十二）  蕙君　　屋子裏，瑪姬毫無精彩地對電話講﹁噲，噲，﹂在突然喘息。﹁潘脫？潘脫！什麽······你？﹂她面部的迅疾變易的表現反映出愛戀，愉快，欣慰，精神振作丨丨可是那兒没有誰瞧見。﹁我是的，潘脫，﹂她終乏，温柔地說。﹁我是！是的······是的！﹂　　凉台上的人是驚呆了，當她飛也似的衝出來，誰都莫名所以。雜貨店生正在交付五塊錢給亞勃爾，又停下來問她：﹁你在賽珍會裏玩得開心嗎，瑪姬？﹂他望着她，懷疑地。可是瑪姬，她的頭斜向後面，愉快地喊：﹁我生平從没有這麽快樂！﹂光着頭，她奔下階級，到銀色的雨點裏。　　﹁瑪姬！﹂美烈莎喊。﹁你可是發瘋嗎？快不要在雨裏淋！﹂可是瑪姬，不回身，不聽到，此刻己到了大道上，像水鴨般奔···奔···奔···　　在大道的一端，她站住了，望着遠處。她的心瘋狂地跳了，從密密的雨點中，瞧見一部汽車在迅速地馳來。車子在她旁邊停下，潘脫已跳出來。他的手抓住了她，在一種飢渴的火熱的擁抱中，把她舉起地面。　　﹁瑪姬！﹂他聲音喘息地說。﹁瑪姬！﹂﹁潘脫！﹂她喃喃地對偎在她唇上的他的唇說。銀色的雨練打在他們身旁的廣告牌，把牌子貼着已變色的賽珍會廣告紙剥落了。雨點不絶在打，打，打在他倆緊用拼合的快樂的臉上，他倆依然不動。（完）</p>

<h3>Yesterday Morning, The Enemy Launched Another General Offensive on Various Passes of the Great Wall</h3>
<p>The Battle at Jielingkou Was Particularly Fierce</p>
<p>The Enemy Attacked Our Outpost Line from Wangjiagou</p>
<p>Minor Skirmish Between Enemy and Our Sentries at Shimenzhai</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, the Japanese army launched its second general offensive on various passes of the Great Wall. Around 5 a.m. on the 10th, at Jielingkou, a combined force of several thousand Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillerymen fiercely attacked the positions of a certain unit, with multiple aircraft providing bombing cover. Our troops calmly responded, and the enemy failed to achieve its objective. Intense fighting continued into the evening. From 2 a.m. to 3 p.m. this morning, over forty Japanese aircraft flew in formations to reconnoiter our positions, dispersing towards Taitouying and Lulong. They dropped fifty to sixty bombs near Haiyangzhen, causing severe damage to the residents. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) Around 6 a.m. on the 10th, enemy forces from Wangjiagou, near Jielingkou, engaged with our outpost troops. Simultaneously, approximately five hundred enemy infantry and cavalry, along with several tanks and armored vehicles, were sighted at Jiangangling, advancing from beyond the pass towards Wangjiagou. Enemy artillery batteries were positioned at Liushugou and other locations, with significant reinforcements continuing to advance. Our Wan Jun Miao Division is currently engaged in battle with the enemy.

<p>Linyu: Around 5 a.m. this morning, several thousand enemy infantry, cavalry, and artillerymen launched a fierce attack on the positions of our certain unit at Jielingkou, with several aircraft providing bombing cover. Our troops calmly responded, and the enemy failed to achieve its objective. Intense fighting is currently ongoing. Furthermore, from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. this morning, over forty enemy aircraft continued to reconnoiter our positions, dispersing towards Taitouying and Lulong, dropping fifty to sixty bombs near Haiyangzhen, resulting in immense losses for the civilian population.

An airfield is being constructed in the area. This morning, over three hundred large carts transported military supplies to Shimen. (10th Dispatch)</p>

Also, around 6 a.m., a large formation of enemy aircraft departed to conduct bombing raids, first targeting our Ping Shan Battalion's line northwest of Liujiang with intense bombing. Our troops calmly remained hidden, avoiding significant casualties.

<p>(Beiping) The enemy has reinforced Suizhong with over three thousand fresh troops, with the main force deployed along the Shazhaizhai and Xinglongyu line. Only the Iwata detachment, along with heavy artillery and armored vehicles, is stationed at Shimenzhai. The remaining forces consist of Koreans, Mongolians, and Li Jichun's puppet troops. The Japanese plan to use Mongolian, Korean, and puppet troops for the offensive to avoid Japanese casualties. However, the puppet troops lack combat effectiveness, leading to the failure of this offensive in eastern Luan. Faced with this situation, the enemy has changed its strategy and is now sending its regular troops to attack eastern Luan again. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo telegraphed on the 9th that the enemy had transferred troops from Suizhong over the past two days to reinforce Shimenzhai, seemingly preparing for a large-scale counter-offensive in eastern Luan. Our side has made thorough arrangements and is determined to deliver a severe blow to any enemy advance. Yesterday and today, enemy aircraft dropped heavy and incendiary bombs on various counties in eastern Luan, with over ten villages and towns being bombed and set on fire. The suffering of the residents is unbearable. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy has repeatedly transferred reinforcements from Suizhong, marching on foot through Wanjiatun to Jiumenkou, to reinforce Shimenzhai. The number now gathered is estimated at over five thousand, mostly composed of puppet troops, often referred to as "Jing'an Guerrilla Corps" and "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps," stationed in the areas of Beilin, Nanlin, and Liangjiashan north of Shimenzhai, confronting our troops. Last night, there was intense fighting between Beilin and Wangzidian. Our cavalry engaged with the enemy for an hour before finally repelling them. Currently, our troops have surrounded Shimenzhai, preparing for a full-scale general offensive. The enemy is also reorganizing its troops, attempting to launch a counter-offensive. A major battle is imminent. Our front line is at Majialing, only three to four li from Shimenzhai. A certain unit of our army has reinforced Haiyang and Tanghe. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to military reports from Lengkou, around noon on the 9th, approximately five to six hundred enemy troops were simultaneously discovered on the front lines of a certain unit of our army and a certain unit.

Four to five hundred refugees from Shimenzhai remain at Shazishan. The enemy has retreated and gathered at Shimenzhai and Shazhaizhai, busily constructing defensive works. The remnants of Zhao Lei's puppet troops remain on the front line. According to prisoners, the puppet troops fire their rifles into the air whenever they make contact, stating that they do not want Chinese to fight Chinese. The Japanese fear a mutiny among the puppet troops and are not issuing mortars or machine guns to them. The number of bullets carried by each person is also limited. On the 9th, a regiment of enemy reinforcements departed from Wanjiatun for Jiumenkou. This morning, there was localized fighting near Liujiahe. (10th Dispatch)</p>

Our troops calmly responded, and at about 10:00 AM the enemy again used infantry to attack our positions. Our troops waited until they were close before using artillery and machine guns to fiercely strafe them, and launched a counterattack with a part of our troops, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers. By 1:00 PM, the enemy was unable to hold out and retreated.

<h3>Enemy Forces Begin Counteroffensive on Xifengkou Front</h3>
<p>Small Units Harass Our Positions</p>
<p>Contact Occurs Around Panjiakou</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday and the day before, the enemy forces on the Xifengkou outer front began to counterattack our positions. The enemy troops mostly used mortars to bombard us from more than seven or eight li away. Localized clashes have occurred at Dongjiakou for several consecutive days. These are newly arrived reinforcements. The enemy forces do not seem to be using their main force on the Xifengkou front, and have already transferred fresh troops to Ying Shouyingzi, south of Chengde, numbering about two thousand. They seem to have the intention of peeping into the passes of Xinglong County. Song Pang has already transferred a certain unit to concentrate in the territory of Xinglong County to make careful arrangements. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy is transferring reinforcements outside Xifengkou, and has been harassing our positions at Panjiakou, Dongjiakou, and other locations with small units in recent days, seeming to be preparing to attack. Our troops are preparing to deliver a head-on blow. The situation at Xifengkou is extremely tense. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Xifengkou was received this evening, which stated that the fierce battle continues today. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xinglong County reports that yesterday evening, people from Ying Shouyingzi reported that over fifty enemy troops entered the street, advising the villagers to return to the puppet state, and said that planting opium was very profitable, etc., and carrying various notices and pictorial propaganda materials, which were delivered to the village to be posted.

<h3>British Prime Minister MacDonald's Letter (Part 2)</h3>
<p>(3) The War Debt Problem</p>
<p>An obstacle to the recovery of the world economy, in addition to reparations, is war debt. The total amount of military loans from the Allied nations during the European War and reconstruction loans after the war is estimated at over 10.338 billion US dollars. The repayment period is 62 years. The principal and interest total over 22.188 billion US dollars. Until June 1931, when President Hoover announced the suspension of reparations and war debts, the total amount repaid was only 2.6 billion US dollars. Last year, the reparations issue was resolved at the Lausanne Conference. In Britain and France, it was believed that reparations and war debts were related. Furthermore, reducing reparations was a condition for reducing or eliminating war debts. However, the United States insisted that reparations and war debts were different in nature. In addition, many of the stocks and securities that have been relied upon as tools for prosperity in recent years have been issued with war debts as collateral. Only by insisting on repayment can the credit of the United States at home and abroad be maintained. Otherwise, if war debts are eliminated, the financial, industrial, and agricultural sectors of the United States would inevitably suffer serious impact. Although the amount is only 300 million US dollars per year, the lack of government revenue is more evident due to the delay in war debt payments. Therefore, at the end of last year, the United States sent a note to Britain and France insisting on repayment.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, Britain decided to pay. Fourteen percent (19.6 million pounds) of the 140 million pounds of reserves held by the Bank of England were transferred to the US to pay the debt. This repayment is likely to be the last one and a condition for future revisions of the war debt. Although the United States has denied this, the British government's intention is very firm. Other countries such as Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Finland have followed Britain's lead and repaid their debts. However, France still insists that reparations and war debts are inseparable. At the same time, the amount that France should have received from Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and other countries in 1931 was 39 million pounds, while only 23 million pounds were paid to Britain and the United States. France lost 16 million pounds. The same was true last year. If reparations and war debts are combined, France's average annual income is 51.12 million pounds, while payments are only 31.8 million pounds. In this case, the annual loss is 20.1 million pounds. France cannot remain silent. Therefore, it will not pay war debts to the United States. Following France's lead, countries such as Belgium, Poland, and Estonia have not paid their war debts. As a result, this problem has been delayed until now and is a major cancer between Europe and the United States. How to cut it open and resolve it depends on the outcome of the upcoming consultations between the authorities of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(4) Arms Reduction</p>
<p>The Disarmament Conference has been open for a year. Its achievements need no further elaboration. The new disarmament plan recently proposed by the British Prime Minister has not broken away from the old conventions. Everyone knows this. In the East, it is hindered by Japan's Monroe Doctrine of the East. In the West, it is plagued by France's "security guarantee." In addition, there is Germany's demand for "equality of armaments." Its effectiveness can already be seen.</p>
<p>Even the United States, which is known for its love of peace, has been threatened by the Pacific shipping lanes since the September 18th Incident and the subsequent Shanghai War. Therefore, it has had to concentrate the Atlantic Fleet in the Pacific Ocean to prepare for any unforeseen disaster. In particular, the proposal of Mitchell, the former commander of the US Army Air Corps, to the House Army Committee is even more blatant. He said:</p>
<p>"The United States should establish a new Department of Defense and place the Army, Navy, and Air Force under the control of one person. Needless to say, the United States' defense should be concentrated in the Pacific Ocean, because there is a world hegemon and an extremely stubborn country controlling it. I have worked with them in Siberia, Manchuria, and Japan and know that they have the ambitions of Genghis Khan's expedition. Therefore, no matter what our wishes are, we will not be able to avoid conflict with them sooner or later. Therefore, under these circumstances, the United States' failure to strengthen its air force is the most unwise thing to do..."</p>
<p>The United States' active strengthening of its air force and construction of airships shows that this is not an exaggeration. Japan's so-called arms buildup is ostensibly trying to avoid war, but in reality, not only have the first-year soldiers been sent to the battlefield in Rehe, but also new regulations for special officers have been established to increase the number of special military officers to make up for the shortage of lower-level officers. Its expansion of military spending is clearly a wartime situation. Its occupation of islands north of the equator, its attack on Rehe, its trampling on eastern Luan, and its spying on Dolon are all symbols of intentional challenge. Even if we retreat ten thousand steps, it is active preparation for war, without a doubt. In this kind of encirclement, there are two other countries besides the United States that must seriously consider their own positions. The first is Britain. It has very deep commercial and investment relations in the Far East. If Japan's so-called East Asian Monroe Doctrine is formed, will Britain be willing to accept it? The second is the Soviet Union. It is developing upwards. Vladivostok is the only seaport in the Far East. If the Middle East is cut off by Japan, how will the loss be made up? At the same time, there is also extreme disharmony between Britain and the Soviet Union. The shape of opposition is becoming increasingly apparent. This kind of contradictory contradiction cannot be resolved in the end. It can only be allowed to expand.</p>
<p>In short, the Washington Conference of the important officials of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and Germany has not yet officially opened, and the results are difficult to predict. However, judging from historical traces and the above-mentioned points, all countries are exhausting their efforts for the prosperity of their own countries. Therefore, the situation of opposition is becoming increasingly serious. Perhaps war debts can be used to open up a new path. Other things such as the recovery of the world economy and the reduction of armaments may only be empty words and difficult to achieve practical results. Even sanctions against Japan are just a kind of public opinion action. The final liquidation will ultimately depend on the competition of strength.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bombing in Various Counties of Eastern Luan Is Increasingly Tragic</h3>
<p>Mostly Departing from Aircraft Carriers</p>
<p>Formations Separately Dropping Giant Bombs</p>
<p>(Beiping) Luan County reports that at 6:30 this morning, twelve aircraft from a Japanese aircraft carrier on the sea off Qindao flew in formation to bomb Haiyangzhen, Shenhepu, and Liujiang, and also dropped several bombs in Changli Nandasi and other places along the Beining Line. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) In eastern Luan, enemy aircraft have been rampant in recent days, conducting reconnaissance everywhere and bombing everywhere, becoming increasingly tragic. On the 10th, seven aircraft arrived in Haiyang and dropped over twenty bombs, twenty aircraft in Shenhepu dropped several bombs, one bomb landed on the beach and did not explode, and was later found to weigh over sixty catties, over twenty aircraft in Funing dropped over thirty bombs, seven aircraft in Lulong dropped seven bombs, five aircraft in Qian'an dropped five bombs, over twenty aircraft in Taitouying dropped over ten bombs, and two aircraft in Luanzhou circled the Luanhe Railway Bridge for a long time without dropping bombs. Enemy aircraft traces were found all along the Luan Northeast Ning Line. The enemy aircraft's origin is one in Suizhong, with a total of thirty-seven aircraft, belonging to the 11th Brigade, and one on the sea off Yuqin, with an aircraft carrier carrying over thirty aircraft docked. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>No Enemy Traces in Eastern Chahar, Enemy Aircraft Flew to Duolun and Dropped Bombs</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yang Zhaogeng, Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government, arrived in Ping from Zhangjiakou this morning, and will go to Tianjin in a few days to visit Song Zheyuan and report on the recent situation in the province. According to him, an enemy aircraft flew to Duolun yesterday afternoon and dropped seven bombs, killing four merchants and civilians, with no other damage. Our troops' positions in eastern Chahar are solid, and there are no enemy traces. The enemy in Weichang Jingpeng is the rebel troops of Cui Xingwu, the cone-shaped mountain area is the bandit troops of Liu Guitang, and the area near Fengning is the rebel Zhang Haipeng troops. The Japanese Mogi cavalry once went to Fengning, but were later transferred elsewhere. There has been no contact along the eastern Chahar line recently. The Chahar Provincial Government is as usual, and Feng has no plans to leave Zhang. He spends his daily life reading and practicing calligraphy. The rumor that he is training troops in Chahar is not accurate. As for the soldiers with Feng Army armbands found in various places within the customs, they are the troops of Feng Zhanhai. Fortunately, there is no misrepresentation. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Guyuan states that Feng Zhanhai convened a meeting of various brigade commanders at a certain place on the night of the 8th to discuss all military matters, and concrete plans were made regarding defensive positions, maintaining discipline, and raising supplies. On the morning of the 9th, Feng Zhanhai and the brigade commanders and other consultants went to the northwest positions of Guyuan to inspect and supervise the construction of fortifications. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Dianying telegraphed to the capital that there have been no major battles on the front line in recent days, and he is sharing defense duties with friendly forces. Our troops are constructing fortifications in the areas of □□ and □□□. Although Japanese bandits occasionally drop bombs from aircraft, these are all insignificant matters. If there is nothing that can be reported to comfort the people of the country, there is no need to say much. The work of resisting Japan should wait for three or five years, and when we are fighting bloodily on the front line, we will tell the people of the country. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Central Route of the Pursuit and Suppression Army Takes the Offensive Again</h3>
<p>Mao Bandits Withdraw from Xingan</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The main force of the bandits is still in Yihuang, Le'an, Dongpi, Zhaoxieshan, and the Fujian side's fortifications are extremely solid. The central route is taking the offensive again, expanding south along the entire line. Jinxi is about to fall. The Mao bandits in the lower reaches of the Gan River have withdrawn from Xingan because the main force in Fujian has failed. Zhangshu is safer than it was a few days ago. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) With the country in grave danger, Jiang is determined to first eliminate the bandits. It is heard that Guangdong and Guangxi will send □□ regiments, Hunan □□ regiments, and Fujian □ regiments to advance into eastern Jiangxi. Liu Zhi will send a certain division □ and other divisions into Jiangxi. A certain important person has made the bold statement that he will come to Jiangxi next month to see the bandits completely eliminated. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Antiques from Teng County Arrive in Jinan, According to Research, They Are Eastern Zhou Sacrificial Vessels</h3>
<p>(Jinan) In addition to the eleven items reported in the newspaper, another ding, lei, and zun were obtained from the Teng County antiques yesterday, for a total of fourteen items. Today, they were all transported to Jinan. The bottom text of one dun reads, "Meng Congfu made the Youbai pan dun for his sons and grandsons to treasure forever." The cover text of one dun reads, "Meng Congfu made the treasure dun for his ten thousand years of sons and grandsons to treasure forever." The cover characters of another dun are slightly the same. The rest are slightly the same. The characters of the other items have not been revealed due to the thick green rust. According to Wang Xiantang's research, they are Eastern Zhou objects. Teng and Zou are adjacent, and Meng Congfu must be a member of Mencius's clan. This can be used to study Mencius's family history. Each item is a complete set of sacrificial vessels, which is rare. The fish bones are still complete inside the ding, which can be used to study ancient biology. All the vessels have seat patterns. There has never been a seat in the Zhou Dynasty. They are arranged neatly, which can be used to study the ancient system. In short, these items are of great value. It is decided to write a special book to record them. The place to preserve them must wait for Han to return to make a decision. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Note on the Four-Power Pact Plan Sent Out</h3>
<p>Papen Meets with Mussolini</p>
<p>Mussolini Strongly Advocates Treaty Revision</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 10th: A State Council meeting was held this morning at the Presidential Palace. Premier Daladier reported on President Roosevelt's invitation to the government regarding talks on the World Economic Conference and the appointment of former Premier Herriot as the French representative, which was confirmed by the State Council. Furthermore, the note and proposed text prepared by France regarding the Anglo-Italian Four-Power Pact plan have been drafted and reported by Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour and approved by the State Council. The content is divided into two parts: (1) The note is four pages long and describes the French government's views on Four-Power cooperation. (2) The draft pact is two pages long, similar in form to the Anglo-Italian proposals, and specifically explains the meaning of the French note. This document will be immediately delivered to the Italian and British governments by Ambassador Jouvenel in Italy and Ambassador Faraud in England.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 10th: After the State Council meeting, it was learned that the French note on Four-Power cooperation has six articles, the content of which is consistent with Premier Daladier's views expressed in the Chamber of Deputies, namely, maintaining the privileges of the League of Nations and upholding existing treaties. Herriot's representation of France and participation in the Washington talks is not as a negotiator, but as a reporter. His task is to contact the representatives of various countries, and if the progress of the talks requires communicating with the US government, the French government will instruct its ambassador in Washington to do so.</p>
<p>Guomin, Berlin, 9th: The Berlin Borsen Zeitung today published a noteworthy article by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stating that the desire for treaty revision is now moving forward and is so powerful that it cannot be resisted by any dilapidated treaty. Mussolini said that the reason why the desire for treaty revision can move forward bravely is that the whole world is seeking peace. They deeply feel that their wishes can never be fulfilled if peace is not accompanied by justice. Mussolini further said that as early as 1928, he declared that peace treaties are not permanent, citing the Treaty of Sèvres between the Allied Powers and Turkey as evidence. Therefore, if one does not want unfortunate developments to occur, one should start with revising treaties. Anyone who opposes the meaning of treaty revision violates the spirit of the League of Nations. Mussolini concluded by saying, "If the League of Nations does not address this issue cautiously and resolve it soon, then even though the League's new building has just been completed and stands tall on the shores of Lake Leman, its fate will be irreparable." Guomin, Paris, 10th: Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu returned to Paris today after discussing the Four-Power Pact with British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon in London and will then go to the Riviera resort area for a few days of rest.</p>
<p>Guomin, Rome, 9th: German Deputy Chancellor Papen arrived here today to discuss the Four-Power Peace Pact and to negotiate a new agreement with the Vatican. After leaving the train, Papen went to the German Embassy and is scheduled to meet Mussolini for the first time on Monday and visit the Pope on Tuesday. He will stay in Rome for about a week and will make advance arrangements for Hitler's visit to the Italian capital. It is now heard that the Pope will soon advise Hitler to change his policy towards the Jews in order to cultivate a spirit of world peace.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 9th: General attention here is focused on the discussions between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Deputy Chancellor Papen. Papen arrived here this morning, and German Parliament President Goering will also arrive here from Berlin tonight. The talks between Germany and Italy are seen as extremely important. Papen will stay in Rome until April 18 and plans to visit the Pope during this period. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will make Papen and Goering understand that while Italy supports Germany's demands for treaty revision, it cannot tolerate violence. Papen's trip to Rome was originally intended to contact the Pope. He will present German Prime Minister Hitler's attitude towards Catholicism to the Pope, and it is hoped that Vatican officials will be able to understand it.</p>

<h3>Major Overhaul of German Internal Affairs Abolishes Federalism and Centralizes Power</h3>
<p>Various Newspapers Comment on Its Advantages and Disadvantages</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 9th: The Frankfurter Zeitung, a civil-rights newspaper, commented on the measures taken by the Hitler government to reform the internal organization, saying that this reform goes far beyond the expectations of most unificationists. From now on, the states will become "regions" and lose their original status. The German state system will change from a federal system to a purely unified system. Each "region" has become a purely administrative area, and its cabinet members have become administrative officials, only carrying out the will of the governor. All governing power is concentrated in one corner of Berlin, or in other words, in the hands of the Prime Minister. The newspaper acknowledged the convenience of the new organization, saying that as a result of the national revolution, the German state has been strengthened, and the various political parties are not making useless interference in national affairs, which is where its convenience lies. However, it is still a question whether the German people, who have never approved of federalism and have struggled for centuries, will suddenly change their original views and be satisfied with a centralized government. In the future, the Nazi Party may have to re-grant independent and civil-rights-oriented administration to the various regions.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 9th: After the central government promulgated laws some days ago, thoroughly reforming the internal organization of Germany, it will send governors to Bavaria, Saxony, Württemberg, Baden, and Thuringia (i.e., the former states). Federal administrative officer of Bavaria, Nazi Party member General Epp, and administrative officer of Saxony, General Killinger, will be reassigned as governors of each of the said "regions."</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 9th: The abolition of the federal system in Germany and the implementation of a centralized system under the power of Prussia has dealt a major blow to the ideal of German-Austrian unification, which has been advocated since the signing of the peace treaty. This can be seen in Austrian public opinion. The Neue Freie Presse commented, "The historian Treitschke once said that the German Empire is a unified Prussia, with a few vassal states guarding the surrounding areas. This statement is indeed true." The Bundespost newspaper said that the former states of Germany would be fine with being German provinces, so why wouldn't they be fine with being provinces belonging to Prussia? It also said that German-Austrian unification will be difficult to achieve in the future unless all the Austrian states are eliminated and Austria has only one powerless provincial assembly, with a governor sent from Berlin stationed in Vienna.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Situation Uncertain</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 10th: Although Prime Minister Saito believes that Finance Minister Takahashi will not resign, if Takahashi insists on resigning due to illness, then according to the Nichinichi Shimbun, a cabinet change is almost inevitable. The newspaper predicts that after Takahashi's resignation, the new cabinet will be formed in one of the following ways: (1) The Emperor still orders Saito to form a cabinet. (2) Baron Hiranuma, the vice-president of the Privy Council, forms a cabinet of talent. Hiranuma is a leader of the Fascist movement. (3) A pure Seiyukai cabinet is formed. (4) The Emperor orders Seiyukai President Suzuki to form a centralized cabinet. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun's opinion, even if the Saito cabinet fails, a pure Seiyukai cabinet has little chance of being realized.</p>
<h3>Military Clique Colludes with Zaibatsu</h3>

At the same time, the Army Minister plans to use this meeting to find out Finance Minister Takahashi's true intentions regarding the current political situation. Therefore, this meeting between the Army Minister and the Finance Minister has attracted attention from all sides.</p>
<h3>United States Implements Afforestation to Solve Unemployment</h3>
<p>Guomin, Washington, 9th: Recently, unemployed people have been actively registering with government job-recruiting agencies. The number is now close to 40,000.

According to the director of recruiting, it is expected that 250,000 people can be recruited by mid-May. Forest experts have already been hired and will plant forests on barren land to provide timber.</p>

<h3>The Difficulty the Occupying Japanese Troops Will Face</h3>
<p>A Glimpse from the "North China Daily News"</p>
<p>Guerrilla Forces Still Active in Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>Japanese Military Expenditure Has Become a Problem</p>
<p>A dispatch from the "North China Daily News" in Changchun on March 20 states: Since the weather warmed up, the situation in the countryside has become more favorable for Chinese troops to fight. In addition, the Chinese troops' use of smoke screens to counter Japanese aerial bombardments has proven effective. It is anticipated that the nature of the war will soon change. News has just been received here that a passenger train on the Siping-Taonan Railway derailed again, resulting in 40 deaths and 80 injuries, indicating that guerrilla forces still abound in northern Manchuria, taking advantage of opportunities to disrupt the rear. Currently, due to the intense fighting in Jehol, the Japanese troops are urgently transferring reinforcements from neighboring areas, resulting in an actual reduction of defense forces in northern Manchuria. As troops along the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Songhua River have been transferred elsewhere, guerrilla forces have risen up again, attacking trains and villages. The claim of restoring security and order appears to be completely unsupported. As for the true situation on the Jehol front, it is extremely difficult to obtain news due to strict censorship of letters and telegrams. However, even Japanese newspapers and news agencies have admitted that a Japanese unit led by Kato was surrounded and annihilated by Chinese troops. The number of troops was not mentioned, but according to Chinese sources, it was no less than 6,000 men. The Japanese also said that the Chinese troops outnumbered the Japanese tenfold. This news may be accurate, because if the Chinese troops did not have an overwhelming numerical advantage, it would be difficult to win. However, the Chinese troops are familiar with mountain warfare in this area and the muddy roads of spring. Conversely, the Japanese troops were trained in their own country and have never encountered such severe cold weather and rugged mountainous terrain. Therefore, as the weather gradually warms, the rivers thaw, and the roads become muddy, the Japanese troops will face even greater difficulties. It is also reported that in the past week, Chinese troops used smoke screens to completely prevent Japanese troops from using aircraft for bombing and reconnaissance. In the past, Japanese troops in Manchuria always used aircraft to disperse Chinese troops. If the smoke screens used by the Chinese troops can disable Japanese aircraft, the nature of the war will completely change. Two days ago, a Russian newspaper reporter met with Japanese officials. According to them, given the current attitude of the Chinese side, direct peace talks between Japan and China are absolutely impossible. They also said that the Japanese government intends to implement its plans with the utmost determination and perseverance. However, even though the Japanese military officials say this, the military expenditure has already exceeded the Japanese military's expectations by millions. How much longer the Japanese can bear this huge expense is also a question. It must be known that in today's wars, what is relied upon is no longer just the courage of soldiers, but the funds needed to purchase military supplies. For example, in the aforementioned incident of the annihilation of Kato's entire unit, it seems that the Japanese troops must have run out of bullets, and then engaged in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in the annihilation of the entire unit. If this happens, and neither side retreats, then the side with the larger number of people will surely prevail.</p>
<h3>The Revival of the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Momentum is Strong in Various Counties in Eastern Liaoning</p>
<p>Troops Attacking Jehol Have Concerns About Their Rear</p>
<p>According to news from Beiping, the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army has become active again. Reports from various sources are compiled as follows:</p>
<h3>Wang Fengge Recaptures Tonghua</h3>
<p>Wang Fengge, the commander-in-chief of the Volunteer Army in eastern Liaoning, sent a telegram to Beiping yesterday, reporting on the battle situation: "The Japanese, seeing that the counties in eastern Liaoning have been recaptured by our army after more than a year of arduous fighting, and that we have concentrated manpower and resources from several counties, creating a strong momentum, are deeply terrified. Therefore, in October, they mobilized a large number of enemy troops, including infantry, cavalry, artillery, and air force, to launch a joint offensive against us. We also rose up to resist, fighting bloodily for eleven days and nights. Finally, due to heavy casualties and exhaustion of ammunition, we were forced to retreat to the area around [omitted characters] to reorganize our elite troops, numbering 20,000 men. We were planning to seize the opportunity to counterattack when the puppet army of Liao Bichen, stationed in Tonghua, under the command of the Japanese army, moved northeast with a joint infantry and artillery force on March 20 of this year. In addition, 500 Japanese troops newly transferred from Chaoyang, equipped with mortars and machine guns, also came from the west of Fushun, seemingly attempting to attack our army from both sides. Currently, Commander Fang has been dispatched to lead Zhao's Brigade, Wang's Regiment, Yu's Regiment, Zhang's Regiment, Liu's Regiment, and Sun's Regiment to ambush in the area around [omitted characters]. Deputy Commander Deng is leading 2,000 men of the Big Sword Brigade to provide support in the [omitted characters] area. Wang himself is leading Han's Brigade, Cui's Brigade, Yu's Regiment, Liu's Regiment, Zhao's Regiment, and others, totaling 5,000 men, equipped with a company each of mortars and machine guns, to occupy the Daloguangou area of Tonghua, taking up key defenses. Once the enemy reaches a suitable location, we will seize the opportunity to launch a simultaneous counterattack."</p>
<h3>Jilin Volunteer Army Captures Japanese</h3>
<p>According to a person from Jilin, on March 11, a thousand volunteer soldiers surrounded Dongning County, quickly occupied it, defeated the puppet police force, and captured the Japanese advisor Hisanao Masae, the translator Miura, and sixteen others. The Japanese troops in Harbin, upon hearing the news, urgently dispatched the Hiraga Detachment to Suifenhe on the 14th to rescue them. However, due to the strong strength of the volunteer army, they dared not venture forward rashly and urgently requested reinforcements from Harbin. On the 17th, the Nakamura unit of 200 men was engaged in fierce battles for days. On March 8, the volunteer army recaptured Baoqing County, capturing the councillor Ishikawa Sangi and others. On March 11, the volunteer army led by Chen Qingshan attacked Mishan, capturing the Japanese councillor Tomita Harumitsu and others alive. The Hulin garrison went to their rescue, which led to the recapture of Gonglin County as well. The puppet county magistrate and councillor Oki Taro were both captured and killed.</p>
<h3>Peng Zhenguo Burns Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>According to reports from Chenglingkou, Peng Zhenguo, commander-in-chief of the First Army Corps of the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, personally led the Dare-to-Die Team leader Zhao Guoyun and others to sneak attack the enemy aircraft factory in Sanjiawan, more than 100 li outside Chenglingkou, at 3:00 AM on the second of this month. They repelled the guards and burned down an enemy Type 87 No. 9 heavy bomber. Continuing forward, they encountered more than 400 enemy troops, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery, engaging in a fierce battle for several hours. The enemy, unable to withstand the attack, retreated while fighting to the north of Xiong'ershan. Our side killed more than 20 enemy soldiers, while suffering no damage due to our advantageous terrain. Important components from the aircraft have been taken back to the rear for reference. Peng also reported by telegram, stating: "According to Dare-to-Die Team leader Zhao Guoyun's report, I was ordered to lead the team to Sanjiawan to burn the enemy aircraft. We arrived at 3:00 AM on the second of this month and dispersed the enemy guards. Seizing the opportunity, we removed the unit Celsius No. 10354, manufactured by the Ota Keiki Manufacturing Company in December of the fourth year of Showa (1929), flying thermometer and compass bulb installed in the Type 87 No. 9 heavy bomber, and then destroyed and burned the important components inside the aircraft. Returning to Xiong'ertou, we encountered a combined Japanese infantry, cavalry, artillery, and machine gun unit of more than 400 men and more than 200 carts, engaging in a fierce battle for several hours. The enemy troops resisted on one side while protecting the carts and advancing towards Lengkou. Due to the disparity in numbers, we did not pursue them and returned to defend our position. In this battle, we killed 14 Japanese soldiers, and many more were wounded. The number of dead cart drivers and horses is unknown. Our army suffered no casualties due to our skillful use of terrain. I hereby submit all the items obtained above. According to this, the items obtained by the team are indeed enemy aircraft supplies, and are currently stored in our headquarters. The details of the engagement are confirmed to be true. I respectfully report this information in advance." Peng Zhenguo kowtows.</p>
<h3>Liu Jingwen Attacks Xiuyan</h3>
<p>According to a person from Haicheng, the Haijiao Li Zirong unit of the Liaodong Volunteer Army is engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in the Changpaozi area of Andong. The enemy, unable to withstand the attack, requested reinforcements from Shenyang. On March 17, the Daicai unit of 240 men went to the front, and they are currently in a stalemate. On March 17, more than 1,000 men from the Liaonan Volunteer Army led by Liu Jingwen fiercely attacked Xiuyan, engaging in a four-hour battle with the guards led by Jiang Quanwo and Feng Ying. The enemy was commanded by Matsumoto and Shima, and their firepower was very strong. Our army retreated slightly, but is still in encirclement. (April 8)</p>

<p>The memorandum states: (1) Li Bili, the French Consul in Tianjin, under the order of the French Legation, previously stated that the property could not be transferred to the Chinese government in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the 1901 Sarraut and Le Duc agreement regarding the operation of the Naval Medical School and the rules of the school regarding the French Municipal Council. Moreover, the school has now ceased to exist, and the condition of employing French teachers has not been fully met. The salaries and allowances of the French teachers who taught at the school in the past have not yet been paid in full. (2) Zhang Xueliang, the chairman of the Beiping Military Council, is now willing to negotiate a practical and thorough solution to this long-standing case and a fundamental solution under appropriate conditions. (3) French Consul Li Bili, in order to promote Sino-French friendship and in response to the wishes of the Chinese government representatives, is willing to resolve this outstanding case in order to take into account the common interests of China and France. The total area of the land is 39 mu and 2834. (4) With the exception of the land to be demarcated for the construction of roads and the Pasteur Institute, the remaining land and property will be transferred to the Chinese government. (5) If any disputes arise regarding this case in the future, Zhang Xueliang, the chairman of the Beiping Military Council, will be fully responsible, and the French Consul in Tianjin will not be involved. (6) The conditions for the transfer will be set out in a separate agreement.</p>

<h3>Wall Collapse Tragedy at the Bengbu Huainan Coal Plant</h3>
<p>Stone Wall Collapses Due to Rain</p>
<p>Many Workers and Their Families Killed and Injured</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Bengbu, the Huainan Mining Bureau leased nine mu of land from the Railway Bureau north of the Bengbu-Heng Railway last autumn to build a coal plant dedicated to coal storage and sales. A wall was built around the perimeter, six and a half feet high and one foot wide, made entirely of white stone to protect the coal piles. The plant employed 168 workers, many of whom lived in the worker housing built in the coal plant. Many others, with their families, lived in dozens of thatched sheds built outside the east wall of the perimeter. The coal plant repeatedly ordered the workers to relocate because the thatched sheds of the workers were a hindrance to the view, but the workers had not relocated because it was difficult to find land. However, the coal plant was located in a low-lying area, which was prone to flooding. When the wall was built last autumn, the wall trench was too shallow and the foundation was not solid, so the wall was in danger of collapsing. Recently, due to continuous rain, water seeped downward, the ground softened, and the wall base gradually sank. In addition, the wall stored more than 5,000 tons of bituminous coal, piled up like a mountain, putting pressure on the wall, making it more dangerous. At around 4:00 AM on the ninth, dozens of poor workers and their families in the thatched sheds were sound asleep when the wall near the thatched sheds suddenly collapsed downward. The coal piled inside the wall fell down with it. With a loud crash, like a landslide, the wall collapsed for about ten zhang, crushing nine thatched sheds outside the wall. Men, women, old, and young in the sheds were all covered by coal dust and stones. The coal plant, realizing that the stone wall had caused the disaster, immediately sent workers to rescue them. However, the workers in the sheds had all been buried by coal and stones. They tried their best to search, but only found a large number of dead and injured men, women, and children by 8:00 AM. Nineteen people were killed and five were injured. Some were crushed to death, others died from suffocation. The sight of blood and flesh was too horrible to bear. The five injured people were sent to the Min'an Hospital for treatment, while the families of the dead wept beside the corpses, which was very tragic. The director of the coal plant, Mei Anlan, immediately reported the incident to the Luohe Huainan Mining Bureau by long-distance telephone and requested that personnel be sent to assist in handling the aftermath. The instructors then reported to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that personnel be sent to examine the scene, and telegraphed Yuan Xingzhou, the magistrate of Fengyang County, requesting that personnel be sent to Bengbu to examine the corpses for burial. The director of the Public Security Bureau, You Kaiyun, personally inspected the scene and has submitted a report to the Anhui Provincial Government. (April 9)</p>

<h3>Road Workers' Armed Fight Leads to Death</h3>
<p>Workers from the Shui and Mu gangs of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway construction project had a misunderstanding over a piece of wood on the afternoon of the ninth of this month at the Jiapu Bridge near the Wu River border of Suzhou. More than 50 workers from the Shui and Mu gangs engaged in an armed fight, because there were few carpenters, there was a minority of people against many people. The carpenter Lin Fusheng was brutally beaten to death by the Shui gang. The Shui gang workers immediately scattered and fled after realizing that they had caused the disaster. The carpentry gang immediately sent someone to Suzhou to negotiate with the foreman Xu Youdao, and at the same time reported to the local court's procuratorate, which sent people to inspect the scene on the tenth and to track down the murderers and bring them to justice for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Puppet Organization Acts as Accomplice, Blocking Eurasian Transportation</h3>
<p>The Chinese Eastern Railway Issue Becomes More Serious</p>
<p>(Harbin) (The puppet) Manchurian government ordered all agencies in Manchuria to block eight sections of the Chinese Eastern Railway at Manchuria Station on the eighth, all of which were erected with wooden sleepers and piled with sand, without cutting off the tracks. The Railway Bureau severely monitored the scene, causing considerable tension within Manchuria Station. Traffic at that location, other than international trains connecting Europe and Asia, was completely blocked. (Jiji News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) (The puppet) Manchurian government sealed off the connection between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Zabaikalsk Railway in Manchuria. Russian cadres of the Chinese Eastern Railway remained temporarily silent, but on the ninth, Deputy Director Kosniov told Director Li Shaogeng that the Russian side had seized 3,800 freight cars that had entered the Zabaikalsk Railway and would return them to the Chinese Eastern Railway authorities via the Siberian Railway and the Ussuri Railway. The deputy director's remarks were full of profound meaning, because the Russian side had no right to protest against (the puppet) Manchuria's actions and feared that (the puppet) Manchuria would again implement the blockade of the eastern border railway. Therefore, in order to investigate (the puppet) Manchuria's opinion, it expressed such skillful diplomatic remarks. (Jiji News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia to Release Chinese Eastern Railway Freight Cars</h3>

<h3>One Brigade of Puppet Troops Defect at Lao Shao Gou</h3>
<p>(Harbin) It is heard that a brigade of about 3,000 men from the "Manchukuo" defense force at Lao Shao Gou (transliteration) has already defected and is heading north. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun of April 5 reported that the 3rd Cavalry Company of the "Puppet State" Jing'an Guerrilla Force, which was ordered to attack Jehol, shot and killed Lieutenant Oishi, a Japanese national, in the vicinity of Dahushan while refusing to advance to Jehol, and desperately tried to escape. They would join Deng Tiemei's troops in the Triangle Zone. On the morning of the second, they were stopped by the Liaozhong County Police near Xiangjiakouzi in Liaozhong County. As a result of the fierce battle, two people were shot dead on the spot, 20 people were arrested, and one machine gun, 20 carbines, and 24 horses were seized.</p>
<p>Washington Conference</p>
<h3>The United States Prepares to Conclude New Reciprocal Trade Agreements with Various Countries</h3>
<p>Protective Tariffs to be Abolished</p>
<p>Raising Silver Prices Also to be Discussed</p>
<p>Japan Attaches Importance to This Conference</p>
<p>A dispatch from Kokumin Shimbun, Washington, 9th: The US government will ask Congress to amend new bills in a few days. In fact, it will be equivalent to authorizing the president to replace protective tariffs with reciprocal tariffs. However, the US government still does not want to completely remove the barriers to American industries and subject them to unhindered competition from foreign goods. It will still use special treaties to control this competition. The previous Democratic administration had made promises to conclude such treaties. Now, after Easter, government officials and special envoys from various countries will stop releasing [from commitments] and will begin discussing the conclusion of new agreements. Thereafter, consultations may have to continue until June 1.</p>
<p>It is said that one of the main purposes of this Democratic Party plan is to seek to relocate American commercial factories back to the country. Since Congress levies high tariffs, other countries also implement retaliatory taxes, so manufacturers have no choice but to set up factories in other countries in order to compete in foreign markets. As a result, unemployment in the United States is increasing day by day. Now, if reciprocal agreements are used to expand the overseas markets for American goods, and at the same time, goods from other countries, especially those that do not compete with American products, are given convenience for sale in the American market, it is hoped that American factories will no longer move abroad and may even hope that they will move back to the country. Several cabinet members now advocate completely exempting goods that are not produced in the United States from tariffs, while others advocate levying extremely low taxes in order to take into account tax revenue. Although cabinet members and congressmen rarely mention whether these negotiations will involve war debts, it is expected to be an important issue when negotiating with debtor countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th: The US Chamber of Commerce wrote to Secretary of State Hull, saying that if debtor countries can prove that they are unable to repay their debts, then international debts may be temporarily allowed to be deferred. Congress should authorize the government to negotiate agreements that promote the best interests of all countries. Any concessions must be based on reducing the military expenditure of debtor countries. The Chamber of Commerce hopes that the United States will insist on having appropriate protection and adequate provisions to deal with unfair competition.</p>

Over five thousand people visited the exhibition.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began at 2:00 PM. Zeng Zhongming, Yu Tan, and Chen Yaozu served as the presidium, with Sun Li as the master of ceremonies. All staff members, including Zhou Yuenian, Lu Shusen, and Peng Keda, were responsible for reception. Railway police maintained order throughout the venue. Everyone stood at attention and paid the highest respects to the Party, the national flag, and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Chairman Zeng Zhongming respectfully read Sun Yat-sen's will and delivered the opening speech. Yu, the director of the exhibition's office and the director of the Business Department, reported on the progress. Subsequently, Garrison Commander Dai Ji's representative Xu Yiheng, Tianjin-Pukou Railway representative Qian Zongyuan, and Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan delivered speeches in succession, and the event concluded at 4:00 PM. Director of Business Yu Tan led a tour of the various exhibition halls, showcasing the products.</p>
<p>Deputy Minister's Speech</p>
<p>Deputy Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming delivered the opening speech, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, the Ministry of Railways began preparing for the National Railway Line Products Exhibition in July last year. After eight months of preparation, it is finally opening today. We are deeply honored by everyone's enthusiastic participation. The main purpose of this exhibition is (1) to promote the development of national industry. Due to the underdeveloped transportation, the number of participants is limited. However, after a comparative exhibition tour, future products will be even better. (2) To develop the resources of the railway. Today's exhibition only includes products from along the railway line. To encourage more local products to participate, we must develop transportation routes and increase efforts to achieve this goal. The preparation time for today's exhibition was very short, and there are many shortcomings. I hope you will forgive us."</p>
<p>Director's Report</p>
<p>Yu Tan, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, who organized the exhibition, reported, "Today's exhibition has been honored by everyone's presence, and we are very honored. The products along the national railway line are mostly agricultural products. Due to the different conditions of each railway and the incomplete development of the railways, Minister Gu and Deputy Minister Zeng are working hard to develop the national railways, changing the previous passive approach to an active one. Therefore, they are actively preparing to allow more people to enjoy the convenience of transportation. The active work of the Minister and Deputy Minister is truly admirable. In this short-term exhibition, excellent products from various regions are provided for the reference of guests and people from all walks of life in agriculture, industry, and commerce, so that they can conduct research. This exhibition has received social publicity and support, so that it can open today. Minister Gu and Deputy Minister Zeng are working hard to develop routes and improve transportation. The railway can be responsible for freight services. In case of danger, the railway will bear full responsibility. This is the hope that the Ministry of Railways wants to develop. The current decline of agriculture, industry, and commerce is entirely due to the lack of opportunities for exhibition, improvement, and reference. Therefore, we hope to expand routes, which is also a method of national self-rescue."</p>
<p>Speech Summary</p>
<p>Garrison Commander Xu Yiheng's representative Xu Yiheng then gave a speech, saying, "Today, I am very honored to participate in the exhibition and see many exhibits. In this time of national crisis, I feel the great significance of the exhibition even more. It can enable the domestic industrial and commercial forces to develop to the best of their ability, resist Japan with political power, and develop industry with economic power. The reason why China's industry and commerce are underdeveloped is due to the small number of railways. Because there are not enough routes, supply and demand cannot correspond. Now, holding an exhibition can let us know where there is a surplus and where there is a shortage, which is of great significance. I hope that the Minister and Deputy Minister will work hard to promote it throughout the country. This is what I hope from the authorities." Subsequently, Qian Zongyuan and Li Zhaohuan gave speeches in succession (details omitted). The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Discussion of the Xinjiang Incident</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Hui Muslim incident in Xinjiang has been ongoing for quite some time, but the central government is too far away, and news is not easily disseminated. Newspaper reports are often fragmented and disconnected. Even the responsible officials in the province do not reveal the truth and even deny it strongly, causing people in the country to be unaware of the true situation. Yesterday, a reporter interviewed a gentleman who is very familiar with the situation in Xinjiang to inquire about everything. The gentleman said, "The Hui Muslims in Xinjiang account for more than 90% of the province's population. Due to long-term oppression by the provincial authorities, they have no way to report their grievances, which has led to the incident. It has been going on for more than a year. Since the fall of Turpan and other places, the situation has been escalating. In recent days, letters have been received from friends in the Xinjiang Post Office, learning that on January 9th of this year, the British director of the Xinjiang Postal Bureau, Ke Qige, sent an official letter to the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing, stating that the situation around Dihua is extremely serious. One week ago, in Shanshan, 40 miles northeast of Turpan, the Hui Muslims, due to the pressure of the provincial authorities, rose up and killed many Han officials. They were subsequently repelled by White Russian soldiers hired by the provincial government. It is also rumored that Ma's troops in Turpan have mutinied. The four gates of the provincial capital of Dihua are closed, with small cannons mounted on the city walls. On January 12th, another official letter reported that Chinese and White Russians have moved into the city, while Red Russians and neutral parties are living in the Soviet consulate. The Hui people regard the White Russians as enemies because they are helping the government to resist them. Currently, people in Xinjiang are panicked. Heavy artillery is mounted at each city gate, and soldiers are stationed there. The provincial army is surrounded by Hui Muslims 40 miles away from the city and seems to be suffering heavy losses. Although the city defenses are strong, they still rely on timely reinforcements. However, there is no news of the movement of government troops outside the province." It is also said that Ma Shaowu, the administrative chief and commander of the Hash District in the province, also feels that the Hui Muslims are opposing the provincial government, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. If they continue to follow the attitude of the Dihua authorities, concealing the facts from the central government, and do not report the truth, he is afraid that the situation will become too large and unmanageable, and the Red Russians will use the pretext of suppressing the White Russians to send troops into the province, and he cannot bear the responsibility. He has already sent a telegram directly to the National Government, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and other agencies, stating that the Hui Muslim militias in the Hami area have a great momentum, connecting Hami, Turpan, and Shanshan. Yanqi has fallen, Kuqa has been captured, and the reinforcements that have crossed Baicheng and approached Shushupu are not arriving. The provincial army troops are rioting due to not receiving their salaries and have temporarily retreated to Baicheng. The eastern route is extremely tense, and bad news has also been received from the southern route. The natives of Moyu have also gathered to attack the county government, specifically killing Han officials. However, Han merchants and people are unharmed. Currently, only a few counties near Kashgar are still safe, and all other places are ready to move. Please send personnel to appease them as soon as possible. The Hui Muslims here do not know anything about the central government's policies. If they are informed of the general principles, change the previous oppressive and ignorant policies, and release their princes and leaders, the chaos can be easily quelled." It is heard that the National Government has already received the telegram. The gentleman also asked that the Hui Muslims in Xinjiang are forced to resist due to the oppression of Han officials. The provincial authorities have been keeping it secret for a year, and have never reported it to the central government. Even if the central government occasionally learns of the news of the Hui Muslims resisting the provincial government from foreign telegrams, when they send telegrams to inquire, they sometimes do not reply and sometimes deny it. When the Eurasia Aviation Company planned to set up a radio station in Xinjiang to facilitate navigation, the provincial government initially obstructed it in every possible way and later even advocated against it, so that the central government has no knowledge of the real situation in Xinjiang. Recently, fortunately, the transportation authorities have sent out accurate reports, and Ma Shaowu, the administrative chief and commander of the Hash District, has also sent out telegrams, reporting the truth of the incident. At a time when the northeast is suffering from deep-seated problems and the situation in Kang and Tibet is suddenly changing, although Xinjiang is located in the remote west, the relationship is extremely important. I think the central government must have appropriate measures and not ignore it because it is beyond reach.</p>

<p>Mr. Sun Longji, the representative of the 29th Army stationed in Shanghai, received telegrams from Feng Zhian, the commander of the [] Division, and Zhang Zizhong, the commander of the [] Division, stating, "Brother Sun Longji relay to Brother Xiao Xiangge, the enemy has been using air force and artillery to coordinate and cover their infantry and cavalry in a fierce attack on the front of our Xifengkou Panjiakou. Part of the enemy is flanking the Lingzikou and Dalingkou areas of the Great Wall. Our officers and soldiers are determined to die and are fighting bravely. The enemy has not succeeded. Dozens of enemy planes are bombing our rear, and our positions, villages, and towns are half-burnt. The residents who have been bombed to death are a tragic sight. Our officers and soldiers have been fighting hard for more than a month, and their morale is strong. However, the supply of ammunition is seriously lacking, which is very worrying. Also, the enemy is building a road from Chengde to Xinglong County towards Malanguan and may attack from this road. Sincerely, Feng Zhian and Zhang Zizhong."</p>

<p>Song Ziwen and Wu Tiecheng Both Went to See Them Off</p>
<p>Former Acting Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch Council Zhang Xueliang came to Shanghai with his family to prepare for a trip abroad after his telegram of resignation. He stayed in Shanghai for a month and, after being treated by Western doctors to quit all his addictions, boarded the Italian liner Conte Rosso with his family last night. He is expected to set sail this morning, together with the Italian Minister Ciano and his wife, and the League of Nations Commissioner. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Finance Minister Song Ziwen and others went to see them off. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Saying Goodbye to Old Subordinates</p>
<p>Zhang arrived in Shanghai and was seriously ill. He declined to see most guests. After receiving medical treatment, his old illness has been cured, and his spirits have gradually recovered. Last night, he met with more than ten of his former subordinates, including Wang Shuhan, Zhang Zhenlu, Liu Mingjiu, and Gao Jiyi, to say goodbye. Mr. Feng Yong also visited Zhang at 11:00 AM yesterday and talked for a long time before leaving.</p>
<p>Luggage Shipped First</p>
<p>Zhang brought a lot of luggage, so he hired two foreign experts to pack the boxes. It was completed yesterday afternoon, totaling more than seventy pieces. They were transported by Shanghai Moving Company trucks to the Bund on Beijing Road at 2:30 PM yesterday and transferred to the Conte Rosso.</p>
<p>Boarding the Ship First</p>
<p>Zhang finished packing his luggage at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. At 5:15 PM, he and his wife and children took a dozen cars from 181 Julai Road. Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, He Fenglin, and others went to see them off and left together. However, when they reached the Foch Road intersection, Zhang and Du Yuesheng returned to Song Ziwen's residence. Zhang's wife, Ms. Yu Fengzhi, and her five children went first, escorted by Secretary Li Yingchao and Adjutant Tan, to the Jianghai Customs Wharf. At 5:20 PM, they boarded the three small customs steamships Jinghui, Jinghai, and Mianli to Pudong and boarded the Conte Rosso first. Because few people knew in advance that they were going to the wharf to see them off, the number of people was not large. Only Zhang Xiaolin's wife and a few of Zhang's relatives and friends were there. The Public Security Bureau sent another Wanshun small steamship and several water police to protect them.</p>
<p>Ms. Yu's Demeanor</p>
<p>Zhang's wife, Ms. Yu Fengzhi, was particularly haggard because she had just quit her addictions. She wore a red cheongsam with a blue woolen coat. She had difficulty walking when boarding the ship and was supported by a Western doctor and an adjutant. She immediately entered the first-class cabin (N) for rest. The well-wishers exchanged a few words with her and then left.</p>
<p>Jiang and Song Sent Flowers</p>
<p>Before Zhang and others left, many dignitaries sent flowers, including Ms. Song Meiling, wife of Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Finance Minister Song Ziwen and his wife Ms. Zhang Leqia, Central Committee member Kong Xiangxi's wife Ms. Song Ailing, Du Yuesheng, Hu Junzhuang, Yang Zhiyuan, and Zhang's Western friends.</p>
<p>Zhang Boarded the Ship</p>
<p>Zhang himself left Julai Road at about 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon and sent his wife and children to board the ship first. Zhang then went to Song Ziwen's residence on Qiqi Road to say goodbye. It was not until 10:45 PM that he left, and then he and Finance Minister Song Ziwen took Song's car with Secretary Li Yingchao and Advisor Dana to the Bund Tongren Wharf on Nanjing Road at 11:00 PM and boarded the customs steamship Jinghui to cross the river. Zhang acted very secretly when boarding the ship. The Customs had pre-arranged port police at the Customs Wharf at 9:30 PM to guard against accidents, but Zhang did not cross the river from there. After hearing that Zhang had boarded a small steamship at the Bund Tongren Wharf on Nanjing Road, the port police were also ordered to board a small steamship and follow the ship to protect him. The number of people seeing him off was also very simple, only Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Hu Junzhuang, and others.</p>
<p>Traveling Companions</p>
<p>There were a total of eighteen people traveling with Zhang and others this time, including Zhang's wife Ms. Yu Fengzhi and his sons Lu Gan and Lu Xun, daughter Lu Ying, and the youngest son who was still in swaddling clothes, as well as English Secretary Li Yingchao and his wife, French Secretary Shen Zutong, Western Advisor Dana, a German doctor, and other attendants. Zhang's brother Xueming remained in Shanghai and did not travel with them.</p>
<p>Wharf Security</p>
<p>When Zhang's wife and children boarded the ship yesterday, there was security in front of the New Customs. Most of the French Concession police accompanied them to protect them. When they boarded the small steamships Jinghui, etc., the water patrol team followed along with the Wanshun small steamship, so the security was very tight.</p>
<p>Departure This Morning</p>
<p>The ship was moored at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong yesterday. Zhang and his family boarded the ship one after another last night and will leave Shanghai at about 4:00 AM this morning. They are expected to arrive in Italy on May 3rd. After arriving in Italy, they must first see how healthy their bodies are before deciding whether to go to other places.</p>
<p>Italian Minister Travels Together</p>
<p>Those traveling with Zhang from Shanghai this morning also include the Italian Minister to China, Mr. and Mrs. Ciano and their young son, as well as the League of Nations rural affairs commissioners Dr. De Ragenai and Mr. Boris, who are also traveling to Europe.</p>
<p>New Development in National Salvation Through Aviation</p>
<p>The Film Industry Jointly Discusses a Great Plan</p>
<p>Since the China Aviation Association began soliciting members and raising funds in Shanghai, all teams have been working hard under the guidance of the General Team Leader, Mayor Wu. All circles believe that the key to national salvation lies in air defense, and they all unanimously support and cooperate in the work. At noon yesterday, Mayor Wu hosted all the main staff of Shanghai film companies at the Hua'an Hotel to discuss the joint film production plan to raise funds for the "Film Aircraft." Those present included Zhang Shichuan, Zheng Zhengqiu, Zhou Jianyun, Cheng Bugao, Li Pingqian, Xu Xinfu, Li Jinhui, Shen Xifu, Tang Jie, Gao Lihen, Wang Qianbai, Sun Yu, Shi Dongshan, Yuan Congmei, Jin Jingyu, Gao Tianlou, Huang Huaicheng, Yang Tianle, Ren Pengnian, Zhong Boming, Zhang Dewu, Wang Fuqing, Xu Bibo, Zha Ruilong, Ye Tianmi, and Zhu Qingxian from the film industry, and Zhang Tingrong, Li Dachao, Shen Gao, and Zhu Shaoping from the municipal government, totaling more than thirty people. Mayor Wu Chen述 explained the original intention of the initiation, saying that since the aviation national salvation movement began in Shanghai, more than 800,000 yuan has been raised, and 1.2 million yuan is still lacking. With the large population of Shanghai and the enthusiasm of local people, it is not difficult to raise enough in the next twenty days. The film industry should not shirk responsibility and has already made a clear expression. This time, I invite you to specifically discuss the method of Shanghai companies jointly producing a patriotic film to raise funds to purchase a "Film Aircraft." From the perspective of social education, this move is enough to awaken the patriotic spirit of the people to rise up and resist foreign enemies and save the country. In terms of implementing national salvation, it is used to raise funds to purchase aircraft to resist foreign enemies. I hope that all of you present will share your opinions to facilitate the process. Zheng Zhengqiu of the Star Film Company responded on behalf of the others, saying that Mayor Wu is hosting and speaking for the country, and we should assist in purchasing aircraft to unite and save the country. In addition to raising funds to purchase aircraft, the future effect of the film should not be underestimated. China's defeat lies in inconsistency. Now that a strong enemy is approaching, the people should eliminate all private opinions, first seek to save the country, and then talk about other things. He also hoped that everyone would work hard together to make it a success. After the speech, it was unanimously decided to proceed, and each company would nominate one representative to form a preparatory committee to discuss the overall cooperation method. The list of candidates will be announced later after being nominated by each company. The municipal government will designate Zhu Shaoping and Shen Gao as representatives. The guests and hosts talked happily and dispersed. It is heard that the committee is scheduled to hold its first preparatory meeting at the YMCA on Baxianqiao on Thursday. The film industry's joint film production fundraising plan for the "Film Aircraft" is recorded below: (1) Purpose: To raise 200,000 to 250,000 yuan to purchase an aircraft, named "Film Aircraft." (2) Method: Gathering the talents of Shanghai film companies in the Oriental Hollywood, including managers, distributors, directors, actors, and all staff, to cooperate in producing a great film about aviation national salvation, distributed globally. Its income is estimated to be over 200,000 yuan. All staff will be completely voluntary, only receiving honorary awards and not monetary rewards. A part of the expenses required for all negative films and production will be refused by each company on its own initiative. The remaining part will be pre-paid by each company, and it will be deducted first from the income copyright price, with the total amount not exceeding 50,000 yuan. (3) Implementation Procedures: 1. The mayor invites Shanghai film company managers, distributors, and directors (at a dinner or tea party at the Youth Association) to gather and discuss the implementation together. 2. A preparatory committee is organized on the spot (the number of committee members is at least eleven, including two representatives designated by the Shanghai Municipal Government, two representatives designated by the China Aviation Association, and seven representatives from each film company). 3. The preparatory committee is fully responsible for: A. Script compilation and review; B. Nomination of the director. (4) The preparatory committee is reorganized into an executive committee, which is the senior agency responsible for this matter, responsible for hiring actors, allocating production locations, and other matters related to production and distribution. (5) The mayor convenes a second tea party or banquet for all staff to promote progress, and production begins immediately. (6) The production time should preferably not exceed one month. (7) After the film is completed, it will be handed over to the joint distribution department for distribution. (8) Copyright income will be handed over to the China Aviation Association for special custody, designated for the use of the Film Aircraft.</p>
<p>The Sixth Announcement of Donations for the "Ningbo Aircraft"</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association's Aviation National Salvation Fundraising Committee held its sixth announcement at 5:00 PM last night. Those present included General Team Leader Yu Qiaqing, Chief of General Staff Wang Wenhan, Team Leader Yu Xingben, Mao Heyuan, Sun Meitang, Zhang Jiguang, Zhu Xian, Chen Songyuan, Dai Yongtang, Hu Yongqi, Yan Boying, Dai Songnian, Ye Xianggao, Wu Yaqin, Zhang Shenzhi, Dong Xinqin, Lin Mianzai, Liu Zhixiang, Yu Dongxun, and more than eighty others. Chairman Yu Qiaqing first made a speech, saying that since the association began soliciting donations, it has been a month, and thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of the team leaders, the total amount has reached more than 80,000 yuan, but it is still far from the original goal. Because it is Qingming, many people have returned to their hometowns to sweep the graves, so many have not submitted their donations. It has been decided to extend the deadline by one month, and announcements will be made every ten days thereafter. General Secretary Chen Qibo reported on the results of this session, which were 275 yuan from Chen Shifan's team, 200 yuan from Shao Dabao's team, 149 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen from Wu Yaqin's team, 61 yuan from Wu Hongzhang's team, 334 yuan from Zhu Jinjiao's team, 36 yuan from Lin Mianzai's team, 100 yuan from Wu Jingsen's team, 33 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6 fen from Lin Boquan's team, 100 yuan from Tong Xianting's team, 500 yuan from He Shaoting's team, 1,000 yuan from He Shaoyu's team, 239 yuan and 3 fen from Jin Shunqing's team, 44 yuan from He Juxing's team, 120 yuan from Zhou Daohang's team, 89 yuan from He Gengxin's team, 36 yuan from Sheng Xuzu's team, 300 yuan from Zhou Yongsheng's team, 1,335 yuan from Mao Heyuan's team, 200 yuan from Xue Runsheng's team, 10 yuan from Dong Xinqin's team, 30 yuan from Liu Tingsan's team, 8 yuan and 5 jiao from Qian Guifu's team, 16 yuan from Wang Zuan's team, 670 yuan from Yu Xingben's team, 280 yuan from Shao Deming's team, 208 yuan from Zhang Youfu's team, 80 yuan from Hu Yonglai's team, 20 yuan from Chen Xingsun, 50 yuan from Sun Xianggui's team, 200 yuan from Tong Huitang, 23 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen and 8 li from Yu Dongxun's team, 200 yuan from Dai Yulin, 201 yuan from Zhang Liyu's team, 80 yuan from Xin Fanseng's team, 120 yuan from Chuan Qilin's team, 26 yuan from Fang Chunsheng's team, 100 yuan from Shi Zhong'an's team, 1,000 yuan from Yu Zuoting's team, 200 yuan from Yu Wenhao's team, 200 yuan from Li Lishui's team, 150 yuan from Chen Gengxin, 80 yuan from Qian Jinxin's team, 343 yuan from Shu Wenyao's team, 31 yuan from Chen Jingtang's team, 200 yuan from Jin Shanbiao's team, 70 yuan from the straw mat industry association, 5 yuan from Chen Jiugao's team, 50 yuan, 7 jiao, and 7 fen and 8 li from the automatic zero-payment account, 200 yuan from Fan Huichun's team, 125 yuan from Shi Zhikun's team, 20 yuan from Xingling's team, 130 yuan from Ye Qifeng's team, 125 yuan and 9 jiao from Xu Tingzuo, 1,291 yuan, 3 jiao from Jin Runxiang's team, 200 yuan from Chen Songyuan's team, 100 yuan from Hu Yongqi's team, 46 yuan, 4 jiao, and 9 fen from Ye Xianggao's team, 50 yuan from Shui Yunxiang's team, 541 yuan from Dai Yongtang's team, 106 yuan from Yan Boying's team, totaling 12,744 yuan, 1 jiao, and 6 li. Subtracting the 1,854 yuan and 3 fen pre-paid in the previous period, the actual amount raised was 10,890 yuan and 7 fen and 6 li. Adding the 70,345 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 fen and 3 li from the previous five announcements, the total is 81,231 yuan, 2 jiao, and 9 li.</p>
<p>Wang Tingzhang Discusses the Righteous Indignation of Portuguese Overseas Chinese Against Japan</p>
<p>Wang Tingzhang, the Minister to Portugal, stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel after returning to Shanghai on leave. The reporter of the New Voice News Agency met with Mr. Wang at his residence yesterday morning. According to the discussion, Mr. Wang said that the relationship between China and Portugal is now extremely close, and the trade between the two countries is very developed. If it can be gradually improved in the future, it will surely see more progress. There are not many overseas Chinese in Portugal. Most of them are engaged in mining and selling coffee. Since the Japanese invasion of North China, the overseas Chinese in Portugal have been filled with righteous indignation and concerned about national affairs. They are very enthusiastic about donating to the anti-Japanese military expenses. The Portuguese government has a very good feeling for the overseas Chinese, so they can concentrate on their work and live in peace.</p>

From yesterday, the silver and money industries handled registration matters separately. The banking industry was attached to the association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road, and the money industry was attached to the association on Ningbo Road. Only members of the same industry were limited to register. When registering, the holder of the note must fill out a registration application form. After inspection and approval, the association will stamp the back of the note and return the note, while retaining the root.</p>

Then, the Chinese silver tael deposit accounts will be opened. All silver taels belonging to Chinese businesses will be transferred to the silver dollar account. From yesterday, foreign exchange transactions, such as exchanges for first-class banks, US dollars, Japanese yen, francs, marks, and customs gold units, were all calculated in silver dollars at the rate of seventy-five. However, the silver tael transactions between foreign businesses and foreign businesses will temporarily remain the same.</p>
<p>Donations Collected in Silver Dollars</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession believes that the donations and public utility fees in the concession should be converted from silver taels to silver dollars at the legal rate of 715. Yesterday, it sent a special letter to the chief of the Public Works Department, saying, "The Ministry of Finance has ordered the implementation of abolishing taels and using silver dollars in this city. Therefore, all fees of your department, such as electricity, water, telephone, and natural gas fees, which are calculated in silver taels, should be converted to silver dollars at the legal exchange rate of 7 qian, 1 fen, and 5 li, starting from April 6th of this year. Your department and public utility agencies should implement this uniformly, otherwise, please instruct your department and public utility agencies to handle it uniformly as soon as possible to facilitate matters. We hereby request you to investigate and handle this matter."</p>

<p>Medical Circle Chen Susheng Cures a Long-Standing Illness Mr. Li Yingshi, a gentleman from Shanghai, suffered from a strange illness several years ago. His mouth was crooked, he drooled, his speech was difficult, and he could not walk straight, but had to walk obliquely. Doctors said that this illness was a stroke caused by excessive drinking. After being diagnosed and treated by several famous doctors, he has not recovered completely in the past three years. It is heard that after being diagnosed and treated by Dr. Chen Susheng of Shangxian Lane, Kuangjia Road, his steps have become free and he can move freely. His illness has improved by sixty to seventy percent. Many Chinese people suffer from phlegm. Those who like to drink alcohol and those who are obese are at risk of stroke. There are also those who suffer from stroke and cannot speak or move, and are confined to bed for more than ten years. The Chinese and Western medical communities have not heard of any particularly effective drugs or standard treatments for this type of disease.</p>
<p>Wang Ji Yan, Who Is Good at Treating Difficult and Complicated Diseases Since Wang Ji Yan, a famous doctor from Huizhou, came to Jinfu Lane at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai, he has cured illnesses within a year, all of which are serious illnesses such as consumption, stroke, wind paralysis, ascites, menstrual pain, amenorrhea, metrorrhagia, and infertility. Liver, stomach, qi pain, asthma, and cough are especially common. According to patients, Dr. Wang pays attention to pulse diagnosis when diagnosing diseases, so his diagnosis is accurate. He prescribes medication according to the illness, so the medicine is effective. He never cares about consultation fees for poor patients. When prescribing, he also strives to avoid expensive drugs, so the benefits received by patients, whether rich or poor, are not small.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor Dear Sir, Recently, I read a correction to a statement from the Yiyuan Rubber Factory in various newspapers, which I found extremely strange. The manager's behavior of confusing people is deeply resented. Our workers, including Gao Huizhen, Chen Yumei, Yuan A'mei, Wang A'bao, Gao Tingzhen, Wang A'feng, Li Rongyang, Tan Wangqing, Wu Meirong, and others, were taken to the Xiangyuan Tea House on Kade Road by Tang A'huan and Bao Xia, who acted as running dogs of the capitalists and informants, and were arrested by the police, who claimed that they were communists. After questioning by the police, they were released due to lack of evidence. Later, the workers saw that the capitalists were oppressing them in this way, so all the male workers (i.e., casual workers) went on strike, and some female workers also enthusiastically maintained and joined the strike. Now, the capitalists are deceiving foreigners. With the help of the media, the capitalists have sent letters to various newspapers to make corrections, and we do not know what their intentions are. Therefore, we specially send this letter to make a correction. Please appreciate it, editor of the Shen Bao. Representatives: Cai Richu, Jiang Dehua, Li Rong, Chen Zhikang, Yao Shuren, Wu Jinfu, Li Rongqin.</p>

<p>Reader's Advisor A Collection of Letters Discussing the Question of "Can We Return to the Countryside?" (3) Letter from Mr. Liu Simin from This City (1) Further Discussion on "Can We Return to the Countryside?" and the Issue of Education After reading Mr. You's reply to my letter on the 8th, I realized that Mr. You is an agricultural expert who "has personally seen farmhouses in England, America, France, Germany, and Russia, has interacted with several foreign farm children as classmates, has spent several months in foreign villages for practical training, and has visited many rural areas in China for more than ten years since returning to the country, and has read many books and newspapers about rural China"! However, regarding "interacting with several foreign farm children as classmates," we must ask: What is the status of these foreign farm classmates of yours? To be clear, are they "noble classmates" of the rich peasants of that generation? I think Mr. You must have attended a university abroad. Then, the farm children studying in foreign universities are at least children of rich peasants, definitely not workers in the countryside! Children of poor peasants! Then their views are naturally the consciousness of rural rich peasants. Mr. You was influenced by these noble classmates of his. Naturally, his glasses unknowingly became colored, and his psychology unknowingly went wrong. He only saw the prosperity of the upper class in foreign rural areas (i.e., capitalist agricultural societies) and did not realize the misery of the lower class, i.e., the poor masses who were crying out for help! Extending this to Mr. You "spending several months in foreign villages for practical training," he only saw the mechanization and rationalization of capitalist agriculture and did not see the internal contradictions of the entire capitalist rural society, which is "only seeing the trees and not the forest." Mr. You wore "the consciousness of a farmer and returned to the country for more than ten years." Although he "has visited many rural areas and read many books and newspapers about rural China," I must rudely say that Mr. You has not understood the fundamental reasons for the bankruptcy of Chinese rural areas and "the suffering of farmers" at all. Mr. You studied abroad for many years and ran through many rural areas in China and read many books and newspapers. But his conclusion is only: "The most painful thing is that farmers have no education generation after generation." Mr. You's opinion is the same as that of a group of technicians or engineers in factories who say that Chinese workers have no education. The professors of various universities in Shanghai say that "the reason why rural areas are bankrupt, factories are dilapidated, and commercial wars are increasingly declining is the harm caused by not paying attention to academics." Therefore, with a light stroke, they turn the practical actions of resisting Japan and saving the country into "saving the country only through academics" and pull patriotic students from the battlefield and the streets back to school, close the door, and do their academic research! Mr. You feels that "the country is in trouble" and advises people to go to the countryside to create "new idyllic places." Fearing that people do not know where to go, he also tells everyone to "find a quiet and lovely village." This means that this is the way to resist Japan and save the country. Haha! To save the country, one must "find a quiet and lovely village" to live his "idyllic" life and say that it is not "avoiding the world"! Mr. You! To be honest, my word "avoiding the world" is very polite. In fact, this kind of preaching is the most ingenious hostile propaganda in the camp of the anti-imperialist movement and the anti-Japanese movement. This action is at least the act of deserters and laggards! Not only is this kind of action and preaching the act of deserters, but also the gentlemen who only talk about economic severance and economic boycotts when fighting Japanese imperialism to the death are also "deserters." Not only are they deserters, but they are also standing in our camp, helping the enemy eliminate our enthusiasm for armed resistance against Japan. Mr. You may not be used to hearing these words and say that I am speaking out of temporary anger. Okay! Let's talk about education again. I remember more than ten years ago, when the Northern Warlords were at their peak, a group of Shanghai merchants chanted the tune of "talking about business in business" and "not asking about politics." But what was the result? Now, haven't all the friends who chanted this tune become involved in politics? For more than ten years, I have also talked about education with the descendants of educators in China. At that time, they chanted the slogan of saving the country through education, implying that as long as we bury our heads in education, we can definitely influence politics in the long run. I have repeatedly refuted and warned them that education cannot be separated from political relations; it is absolutely impossible to run education divorced from political relations, and the result will only be failure. At that time, naturally, people's words were weak and light, and everyone agreed. But what is happening now? Isn't Mr. Huang Yanpei running around north and south doing anti-Japanese activities? Mr. □□□ was forced to "flee for his life" because he was too enthusiastic about running education in Nanjing. Isn't that a good example? The suffering of farmers, generally speaking, is the result of the opposition between cities and villages and the exploitation of capitalism, not as simple as Mr. You said, the problem of "no education." Let's first use the United States as an example. American agriculture is the best example of capitalist agriculture. According to Mr. You's opinion, the agricultural panic in the United States is only "a temporary lack of turnover, not a true emptiness." This view shows that Mr. You does not understand the rural economic problems of capitalism at all. "Capitalist agriculture is now advancing to the same state of unease as the characteristics of capitalist industry and must inevitably adapt to new market relations," which means that capitalist agriculture has inevitably suffered the historical fate of periodic panic with capitalist industry and will continue to endure it until its demise. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the United States has experienced three panics: 1910, 1920, and 1930 to the present. Its biggest reason is that the law of capitalist concentration operates in the countryside, that is, bank capital dominates the rural economy. We can understand this by looking at the increase in farmers' debt: In 1910, the mortgage debt of American farmers was 3.3 billion gold dollars, 7.9 billion gold dollars in 1910, and now (1933) it has reached 12 billion to 13 billion gold dollars. Therefore, land concentration is increasing day by day. "Even the Hoover Commission had to say that 'the number of middle-class farmers is decreasing day by day. According to the 1930 census statistics, the number of middle-class farmer lands decreased between 1920 and 1930, while the number of poor small farmers...and large farmers increased greatly...'" This shows that the agricultural panic in the United States is a gift from capitalism. We can also predict that it cannot be solved by "the US President issuing 200 billion yuan in public bonds to lend money to farmers" as Mr. You praised, because he cannot prevent the unemployment panic caused by the rationalization and mechanization of industrial capital, he cannot prevent the exploitative system controlled by financial capital from annexing farmers' land, and he cannot avoid "taxes" that are "twice as much as before World War I." Although his "agricultural products" are "piled up like mountains," as Mr. You sang, he cannot eliminate the unemployed population in the American countryside and cities who have no food or clothing, just as the Shen Bao's New York correspondent said, "In some places, large numbers of children are hungry, while in other places, milk is used to feed pigs." This is the inevitable phenomenon of capitalist agricultural society. The idyllic place that Mr. You dreams of is at most like this. As for China's agricultural economy, under the layers of exploitation of imperialist capital, commodities, domestic commercial capital, local tyrants, evil gentry, and exorbitant taxes, only fools will believe that education can liberate farmers. I am not "blaming rural education" (this is Mr. You's misunderstanding), but I am saying that under the current social system (economic and political), only fools will believe that dreaming of saving the country and relieving rural areas with rural education. Mr. You's meaning is even more advanced. He replied, "China will have a solution only when rural education is universal, and then it can resist Japanese aggression externally and eliminate warlords and bad politics internally!" Mr. You does not understand at all what kind of meaning rural education in social struggle and revolutionary struggle is! These are my general opinions on Mr. You's long article on the 8th. The length is already not small, and the rest will be discussed tomorrow.</p>
<p>Important Education News The Ministry of Education Reports on the Implementation of the Education Resolutions of the Third Plenary Session - Nine Items Have Been Handled - The Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee resolved to approve the proposal by Cheng Tianfang to determine the educational goals and improve the system, and the proposal by the Central Organization Committee to reform higher education. The resolutions were revised and passed by the plenary session and submitted to the National Government for instructions to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Education to implement them. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education submitted the implementation situation to the Executive Yuan. The original submission stated: "The original resolutions on the educational goals, the Ministry of Education's fundamental trend for the improvement of national education, and the standards shown in the original resolutions are initially the same. Regarding the first item of the original resolutions on national education, the primary school curriculum standards formulated by the Ministry of Education include subjects such as national language, society (including history, geography, etc.), natural science, mathematics, hygiene, physical education, labor, art, and music, which integrate the Three Principles of the People into them. This is in line with the original resolution's 'to make children have the necessary common sense of Chinese citizens, the content of which includes the preliminary knowledge of the Three Principles of the People...'. The content of the civic training standards and social national language courses is also in line with the original resolution's 'emphasizing the training of children's habits of living in groups, the spirit of hard work and perseverance,..., and the concept of loving the country and loving the nation.' The second item has been promulgated by the Ministry of Education to standardize primary schools nationwide. For the sake of emergency relief, the Ministry of Education has also formulated the outline of the implementation measures for short-term compulsory education, the outline of the implementation measures for the first phase of compulsory education, and the curriculum standards for short-term primary schools or short-term primary school classes in June of last year and promulgated them for implementation. The third item, the central government and various provinces subsidize various counties to expand primary schools with a certain percentage of their revenue, and how to gradually increase it will be submitted to the Central Political Conference for decision in another case. The fourth item, during the university period, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice to use the school's original facilities and teachers to promote mass education. Now, most provinces, cities, and counties have done this. As for another funding item, the National Government has clearly stipulated that social education funds should account for 10% to 20% of the national education funds. Although most provinces, cities, and counties have not been able to fully achieve this standard, the result of urging them has been that most of them can gradually increase. The original resolution on productive education, the primary school curriculum standards formulated by the Ministry of Education, has a labor subject, including various shallow skills of industry and agriculture. The civic training standards focus on concrete matters such as labor production cooperation in economic training. The second item restricts the establishment of ordinary middle schools and expands vocational schools as much as possible. The Ministry of Education formulated the outline of secondary education facilities in April of the 20th year and followed it. Now it is still proceeding according to this policy. The third item, the Ministry of Education has stipulated in the regulations on vocational schools that practice and coursework should account for half each in principle and has detailed the specific methods of practice. The fourth item, vocational schools do not charge tuition fees in principle. The Ministry of Education has clearly stipulated this in the regulations on vocational schools. The second item of the original resolution on teacher education, teachers' colleges are established independently, and the National Government has promulgated and implemented the Law on Teachers' Colleges. Various localities may set up simple normal schools for the urgent need to train teachers for compulsory education. Special normal classes and simple normal classes may be attached to public senior middle schools and junior middle schools respectively. The third item, the characteristics of the current entrance examination for normal schools should be corrected in ordinary universities. The school has drafted a plan and revised the organizational outline and submitted it to the Ministry for approval and instructions for implementation. The fourth item, universities may set up teacher training classes, which the Ministry will notify various universities to add at its discretion. The fifth item, teachers' colleges and normal universities do not charge tuition fees. Provinces and cities should also reduce or exempt students from all or part of the board fees depending on the circumstances. This has been detailed in the regulations on teachers' colleges. The sixth item, the service measures for graduates of teachers' colleges have been detailed in the regulations on teachers' colleges. As for the service of graduates of normal universities, detailed measures should be formulated in accordance with the original resolution and issued for compliance. The second item of the original resolution on talent education, the high school curriculum standards have been promulgated one after another, and there is absolutely no method of dividing literature and science. The fourth item, universities in the same place and with overlapping departments, such as Peking University, Peiping University, Peiping Normal University, Tsinghua, Yenching, Fu Jen, Sino-French, and other universities in Peiping, and Xiehe, China, Chaomin, Guomin, and other colleges, have been ordered by the Ministry to comprehensively plan and discuss the detailed improvement plan in accordance with the principles of division of labor and cooperation and submit it to the Ministry for review and decision. In Shanghai, the Ministry has ordered Jinan University to abolish the Law School, and the original students will be transferred to National Central University for study. The departments of the College of Education will be merged into the Department of Education and merged into the College of Liberal Arts of the University to concentrate its efforts on special improvements. Other universities and colleges will be handled separately at any time depending on the circumstances. The fifth item, the regulations on middle schools and normal schools stipulate that scholarships must be set up, and the amount of funds should be determined. As for universities, detailed plans should be made. The sixth item, the Ministry of Education recently sent personnel to inspect many liberal arts colleges of various universities and ordered that in the future, except for remote provinces, liberal arts colleges should not be established in general to train judges and teachers. The seventh item, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice to various universities and colleges that they should pay attention to domestic teaching materials. The ninth item, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to all schools above the college level last year to report the current training policies and implementation situations to the Ministry for record. Once all reports have been received, they should be reorganized and accurately determined and issued for compliance. In summary, in addition to the above items in the original resolutions, the Ministry will formulate detailed measures and actively carry out the rest. The situation of compliance should be prepared and submitted first for review and approval and submitted to the National Government for review and approval. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Tan Yan Stands in a Wooden Cage - Tianfang</p>
<p>The Shandong I imagine, a province known for its extraordinary people and events, is no longer a land of refined scholars. It's easy to associate it with words like "black shop," "broadsword," "wall-scaling," and "White Lotus sect." This isn't just my overactive imagination; the reality constantly threatens to make me think this way.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Jinan correspondence section of this newspaper, I read another scene from a live drama. It's said that Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuqu, on the fourth day of the month, departed from Jinan to inspect county administration in eastern Shandong. In the afternoon, he arrived at Zao Yuan Station, entered the city by car, and at six o'clock, he summoned officials for roll call. The county government secretary and the public security bureau chief were both forced to kneel, and the public security bureau chief was also fined fifty yuan from his monthly salary. The next morning at five o'clock, he convened a motivational meeting for all government personnel at the county government, and at six o'clock, he inspected the detention center. There, he found a case mishandled by County Magistrate Feng Yonghe and the court, leading to an unjust imprisonment. Chairman Han was extremely furious and immediately confined the county magistrate, judge, and prosecutor in wooden cages, intending to severely punish them. However, after local figures pleaded for leniency, they were released.</p>
<p>Reading this, I couldn't help but murmur "Amitabha," deeply praising Chairman Han's concern for the people's suffering. In just two days, he overturned an unjust case and punished five derelict officials. It can be said that he acted with lightning speed, showing a glimpse of his intent to pacify the people of Shandong with his anger.</p>
<p>Although the newspaper didn't detail the specific offenses of those punished—which is the fault of the reporter—the chairman's "extreme fury" suggests that the matters must have been serious and the punishments deserved. However, "forcing to kneel" and "standing in a wooden cage" are not found in the entire legal code. This must be attributed to the "innovation" of Chairman, the "Big Boss"—to borrow a certain enchantress's term—something to be added to the punishment section for dereliction of duty when the criminal law is revised in the future.</p>
<p>"Standing in a wooden cage" was originally a measure used to deal with "unscrupulous merchants," but now it has descended upon government-appointed county magistrates and judges. It's truly difficult to fathom and makes one curse the originator. As for the public security bureau chief having his salary deducted, even if it's fifty yuan, it's not a big deal. However, the county government secretary being forced to kneel brings a sense of "intellectuals losing face," making the esteemed officials feel quite embarrassed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the chairman's diligence in managing officials highlights the indifference of the Shandong High Court. I truly feel sorry for the officials of the High Court. Negligence is unavoidable, but I wonder if they will "immediately" "request punishment" from the chairman. These are all things worth noting, but Shandong is too far away, so let's wait for later newspaper reports!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Thoughts on a Spring Outing to Songbin - Wang Fuding</h3>
<p>The spring tide of the Song River rushes and flows swiftly eastward, never ceasing.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, I look back at the calamity of the Ren Shen year, sweeping away heroes and eternal sorrow.</p>
<p>Under the clear sky and green fields, the view seems like yesteryear.</p>
<p>The remnants of ramparts still bear traces of heroism and tragedy, moving people to shed tears for the departed sages.</p>
<p>Back then, we hastily defended against invaders, turning the beautiful land into a battlefield.</p>
<p>Old folks talk about the past, and everyone mentions Cai Yong.</p>
<h3>Scientific Airplanes and Bombs - Pei Pei</h3>
<p>"Aircraft...bombing...casualties...heavy..." This is the news we see in the newspapers every day. With Japan's aggressive ambitions running wild today, there's no guarantee that the bombs carried by their planes won't fall here again! Therefore, it's essential to know something about the bombs dropped from airplanes.</p>
<p>(1) Bomb Structure</p>
<p>1. Fins: Three or four thin iron plates attached to the tail of the bomb to stabilize and orient it vertically during descent.</p>
<p>2. Bomb Casing: The casing is typically made of steel-like cast iron or forged steel.</p>
<p>3. Explosive: A highly explosive substance, such as ammonium nitrate or potassium chlorate.</p>
<p>4. Detonator: This is the brain of the bomb. Whether the bomb explodes and the timing of the explosion are all controlled by this device. The detonator is usually located in the nose of the bomb, but it can also be located in the tail or inside the casing. See the diagram for the structure of the detonator. Before dropping the bomb, the safety pin is removed, and then the bomb is released. The wind vane is pushed by the force of the falling air, causing the vane to rotate gradually along the screw on the firing pin towards the lower end of the pin. At this time, only a small rod supports the firing pin in its original position. When the firing pin strikes the ground, the small rod breaks, and the firing pin strikes the percussion cap, igniting the explosive.</p>
<p>(2) Types of Bombs</p>
<p>1. High-Explosive Bomb: This type of bomb is particularly effective for bombing urban buildings and strong fortifications. Therefore, it has the widest range of uses in war. The casing is thin, allowing for a large amount of explosive inside. The nose is fitted with a "delayed-action detonator" (meaning that after the bomb enters the target, it explodes after a very short delay, usually about half a second). Therefore, high-explosive bombs tend to penetrate the ground or buildings before detonating. When encountering this type of bomb, it is best to seek shelter in open areas, which are less dangerous, or in particularly strong underground shelters for safety. Living in ordinary buildings increases the risk. When this type of bomb explodes, it makes a deep, dull sound and creates a large, funnel-shaped crater in the ground.</p>
<p>2. Fragmentation Bomb: These are smaller aerial bombs. The casing is made of steel or steel-like cast iron, and the casing is neither too thick nor too thin. The nose is fitted with an impact detonator (meaning that the detonator explodes upon contact with the ground), causing the casing to scatter in all directions on the ground. Therefore, this type of bomb is specifically used to kill people. It is particularly effective against people and animals in open areas. When encountering this type of bomb, it is best to take refuge inside buildings.</p>
<p>It is even safer if there is a basement. This bomb explodes on the ground, so the explosion sound is particularly loud and a thin layer of black smoke spreads on the ground after the explosion.</p>
<p>3. Incendiary Bomb: The transformation of Zhabei into scorched earth is due to the power of this type of bomb. The main components are a mixture of lead powder and iron oxide. After ignition, it undergoes a chemical reaction, releasing a large amount of heat, even melting the steel casing. It is, of course, not difficult to burn urban buildings to the ground.</p>
<p>4. Gas Bomb: The casing is thin and filled with a large amount of poisonous substances and ammunition that can break the casing and scatter the poison. Because the gas can spread through the wind, expanding the affected area and remaining effective for a long time, this type of bomb is truly the most powerful weapon for future warfare.</p>
<p>5. Flare Bomb: Used for nighttime reconnaissance, it has no killing or destructive power. Light-emitting materials are the most common.</p>
<h3>Ah Gui's Suicide - Xu Yu</h3>
<p>Today's Chinese people are truly much wiser than before, especially in the art of verbal expression, which has made significant progress. All unpleasant facts are presented in a very positive light.</p>
<p>In the past, generals defending cities who unfortunately found themselves in a desperate situation of "no external reinforcements and no internal supplies" would either resolutely hold on with the determination to "live or die with the city," sacrificing their entire family in the defense, or simply disregard the condemnation of future generations and become a "surrendering general."</p>
<p>Today, generals responsible for defending territory, clearly preserving the strength of their private armies and unwilling to fight the enemy, cleverly establish a pretext called "non-resistance doctrine." Clearly fearing death and fleeing at the sight of the enemy, they rationalize it as "shortening the lines of defense" or "luring the enemy deep."</p>
<p>In the past, old-fashioned shops could only secretly suffer losses for unsold inventory. Even selling at a loss was like a mute eating bitter melon, unable to express the suffering.</p>
<p>Today, general companies and stores have ways to make money. Clearly selling poor-quality goods, or even inferior goods with altered labels, they beautifully call it "sacrificing capital" or "reducing prices to help patriotic donations."</p>
<p>In the past, men and women who engaged in illicit affairs between the Sang and Pu rivers would have no excuse and would be scorned and despised once their affair was exposed.</p>
<p>Today, men and women who rent hotel rooms or small houses grandly claim it to be "freedom of love" or "practicing cohabitation love."</p>
<p>This is not only the case with national salvation, love, and business management, but even young people who have fallen into the dead end of "suicide" due to their own depravity have a pleasant name for it, calling it "suicide out of concern for the country."</p>
<p>My neighbor, nicknamed Ah Gui, was usually busy with extravagant prostitution and gambling. Not only did he not care about national affairs, but he couldn't even be found on the day his mother died.</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>Now, he has squandered his inheritance, leaving him with no way out but to commit suicide. This is originally a death that is not to be pitied, and even deserves more punishment. But at the time of "a person's words are good when they are about to die," he still performed a set of fame-seeking tricks, writing a passionate and indignant will concerned about the country and the world, thereby claiming to be a "worried about the world before everyone else" patriotic youth.</p>
<p>Alas, this kind of absurd behavior of deceiving oneself and others will certainly not gain the sympathy of the people of the country. Even if it is truly out of patriotic zeal, such suicide is of no help to the current difficulties and is not worthy of emulation. Because if all the good young people were to retreat from the world, forget their ambitions, and commit suicide out of concern for the country like him, then who would bear the responsibilities of the world and the duties of the nation?</p>
<p>"Suicide is not courageous." This is the most passive and cowardly behavior. I dare to advise all true patriotic youths, "The only difficult thing throughout the ages is death." If we can adhere to the spirit and determination to die, and strive to save the country, then why can't the country's future be achieved? Strive actively!</p>
<h3>Golden Light Shining - Kuang Bei</h3>
<p>[A Parody of the Traitor Hu Lifu]</p>
<p>Inheriting the legacy of his ancestors and surrounded by swarms of lackeys like ants attracted to something smelly, Lifu, relying on his innate business acumen, began to realize his golden dream from 1914 onward. This coincided with the outbreak of the European War, when international capitalists were busy vying for dominance and had to temporarily put aside this dripping piece of fat in East Asia—this piece of fat being our China, with its long history and vast territory.</p>
<p>The reason lies here: Except for the hot and chaotic political and military situation, which was still tumbling in infighting and showed no progress, everything else could be said to have "met the opportune moment." Not only was it barely satisfactory, but everything was also thriving. For example, in terms of industry, the textile, silk, and tea industries all emerged at this time. Those who engaged in these industries all reaped ten times the profits. In this epoch-making opportunity, many capitalists in our China were indeed created.</p>
<p>Lifu was in the gold business, so naturally he also had "good fortune and prosperity." After several turnovers, he earned gold that could be measured by the peck and loaded by the cart. Gold was originally intended to facilitate the dream of golden light shining. Although it cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold, it possesses a transcendent magic. Once a person encounters it, they want more and more. Lifu was exactly like this. He thought, "If all the gold in the world were concentrated in Lifu alone, wouldn't that be something! Besides having the prestigious title of 'Gold King,' I could also do whatever I want and enjoy whatever I want. Wouldn't that be wonderful!" After several years of thorough planning, by the time the European War ended, he had indeed seized a huge amount of gold. Although no one had yet called him "Gold King."</p>
<p>Perhaps it was "when things reach an extreme, they reverse" or "the cycle of fate." From then on, international capitalism even more fiercely rushed towards our country's territory. As a result, we, the big and small capitalists who had just emerged, were like being hit by "tear gas," all pinching our noses and sighing. Lifu gradually approached the road to collapse. However, he struggled to the death until the tide of the economic panic of 1930 swept across the entire world, finally dismantling his stage.</p>
<p>However, it was also at this time that he had new dreams.</p>
<p>Here, the thread of the dream naturally had to leave the dangerous gold business, but it could not be completely unrelated to gold. Because Lifu had observed thoroughly that in the current society, only gold is truly the solution. However, to achieve this goal, one had to avoid the direct route of engaging in the gold business. This made him feel difficult. For this, he was depressed for a long time, unable to find a suitable solution. He was originally a thorough merchant, and except for the magic weapon of doing business, he was completely ignorant of other fields. He had never studied political science, could not understand an essay involving politics, had never learned to write, could not write a coherent declaration, and had never learned to speak Mandarin, only knowing how to babble in local business dialect. In this way, wanting to curry favor with contemporary prominent officials would inevitably be like "a toad wanting to eat swan meat." Therefore, he had never dreamed of drilling into the current political arena.</p>
<p>The unfavorable environment made him extremely depressed, and he sighed with the feeling of "this life is over."</p>
<p>When the times open up and relieve the people's suffering, opportunities suddenly descend from the sky. It is said that after the "September 18th" Incident, although our China lost the vastness of thirteen provinces in a short time, a new "Manchukuo" was established in the world. There, all of our great Chinese citizens were in charge of the government. Needless to say, the emperor and ministers were all our brothers and compatriots. It is said that even young people with no background could hold high positions and obtain great benefits, as long as they were "loyal," loyal to the Japanese who had spent a lot of effort to help establish the country.</p>
<p>So Lifu sighed, "Why wasn't I born in the Northeast!"</p>
<p>But he had a hope, a hope in the South! For example, in Shanghai, there was also this kind of opportunity coming. Sure enough, on the night of January 28th, Shanghai was also attacked by Japanese soldiers. What was hateful was the desperate resistance of the 19th Route Army, which lasted for more than a month. The Japanese soldiers completely occupied Zhabei. So he learned the key to "only being loyal to Japan," flattering and begging the Japanese. As expected, as he had planned, he established a "Local Maintenance Association." Although the association was named this way, it could naturally establish a "Zhabei Nation" at some point. At this time, he happily thought, "I've been waiting patiently for many years, and I've finally encountered an opportunity. In the future, when I become emperor, of course, 'All the land under heaven belongs to the emperor, and all the people within the realm are the emperor's subjects.' Gold, gold, not only will gold not be a problem, but everything will simply belong to me. Wouldn't that be something! I only hope for the realization of this heavenly kingdom."</p>
<p>But in just a few days, all the newspapers carried in special bold type: "Traitor Hu Lifu Arrested and Sent to Beijing."</p>

<h3>Shop Assistant Communication - This Made Him Feel Extremely Embarrassed</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am an avid reader of the Shen Bao, especially the Shop Assistant Communication section. I gain a lot of knowledge from reading your wonderful answers every day. Now, a friend of mine has a very difficult problem, and he has repeatedly asked me to answer it. However, I am a person with limited talent and shallow knowledge, and I cannot give him a satisfactory answer. Therefore, I would like to ask you, could you lend a corner of your esteemed publication to give me and my friend a satisfactory answer? That would be something that he and I would be very grateful for.</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Y, currently works at Company C in Shanghai. He met a female friend while studying, and their friendship developed into love. After two years of long-term mutual understanding, they are now engaged and scheduled to get married this year. However, before becoming engaged to Mr. Y, she—Mr. Y's fiancée—had many male friends and corresponded with them. However, after the engagement, she once broke off communication. But recently, he—Mr. Y—discovered that she was corresponding with two male friends and had even gone to the movies with them. This made him feel extremely embarrassed. Because love does not allow the possibility of a third party joining—now that she is communicating and playing with other men, it is inevitable that her love for him will not be focused. Therefore, he is very angry and does not want to get married until she can realize her mistake. After my repeated persuasion, he has somewhat changed his mind. But now,</p>
<p>(1) How can she be made to stop communicating with men? (2) What method can be used to make her realize her mistake?</p>
<p>Although he has repeatedly advised her, it has not been effective. Because I firmly believe that love must be exclusive in order to achieve perfect happiness! Mr. Qin Yang has profound knowledge and will definitely be able to solve this problem. Here, I sincerely and urgently hope that you can give me a satisfactory answer!</p>
<p>Wishing you vigorous writing!</p>
<p>Sincerely, Shen Shenchu</p>
<p>Editor's Note: "Love does not allow the possibility of a third party joining," and "Love must be exclusive in order to achieve happiness." These two sentences are the same as our consistent position. However, it is necessary to consider whether "communicating" and "watching a few movies" can be regarded as expressions of love. In this year of advocating open social interactions, it is very common for a woman to socialize with several men at the same time before she is engaged. It is through this relatively open social interaction that she can use her eyesight to choose a husband. After she has chosen her lifelong companion, her love will naturally focus on this goal; however, it would be embarrassing and practically impossible to ask her to completely break off contact with other male friends once and for all. You have already been selected by her among many men and are engaged, and your first step is already a victory. You should go one step further to make your love more stable and to gradually cool her relationship with other men. Therefore, after the engagement, after the initial marriage, and even after having children, you should express your love to her and often "communicate" and "play together." Make her single-minded and wholeheartedly concentrate all her love on you. This is not a distressing thing, it is a very sweet thing; this is the art of love. Someone should use this method to gradually sever his fiancée's relationship with men. Her current behavior is not necessarily wrong, and there is no need to make her realize her mistake. You should get married in a short time, because this will give you more opportunities to gain your fiancée's whole mind.</p>

<h3>Novel Dream in the Light and Shadow (Continued 25) - Qin Shouou</h3>
<p>A good environment and high spirits form an eternal direct proportion. As the snowflakes begin to fall, Jufeng is ready to go to the park. She is wearing a thin, rose-colored velvet cheongsam, covered with a half-length silver fox short coat, and carrying a green umbrella in her hand. This sets off her graceful and slender figure. Her dimpled smile, reflected in the silver-like snowy world, creates an undeniably beautiful color scheme.</p>
<p>Because her spirits are so high, it makes Wu Yi, who was forced to come along, seem all the more weak and listless.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Wu Yi, spurred on by a huge advertisement in the newspaper, went to the Bian Er Deng to enjoy a so-called unprecedented sound masterpiece, "Love and Life." The result, however, was a more painful stimulation than being cut in half. The story of the play was extremely convoluted and profound, depicting a beautiful girl who grew up in a world of luxury. Unfortunately, after she obeyed her parents' wishes and married the son of a wealthy man she didn't know, she was loved by a very handsome and noble young man. He loved her madly and made every effort to pursue her, risking danger for her many times. Material and spiritual pain tore apart his entire soul, but he did not retreat. He was prepared to make the greatest sacrifice to create this tragic tragedy. So she was moved, she could not bear it any longer, and quietly abandoned her beloved son, abandoned all the material enjoyments her husband had given her, sacrificed her priceless reputation, and followed the young man. Leaving was of course very easy, but once they left, problems arose. First, he and she could no longer linger in the local area. Since they could not linger in the local area, of course, the only way was to flee far away. But the young man was an unadulterated pauper. Because he had a decent job in the local area, he had not yet starved. But when he arrived in a foreign country, it was not easy to find another job. After they spent all the money they had brought, life became more and more difficult. Although the woman did not show any resentment, the young man's conscience gave rise to a deep sense of remorse and unease. He tried to find a way out, and he mingled with a group of laborers who sold their blood and sweat, working in a flour mill to earn a meager wage to support his lover. However, ten hours of heavy work every day was not something a weak scholar could handle. Gradually, his energy and wages decreased simultaneously. As a result, he died with a mournful cry on the pier where he was transporting wheat. His lover could no longer return to her husband, and could not resist this major stimulus, and died in the river carrying a three- or four-month pregnancy.····················</p>
<p>After watching this tragedy, Wu Yi went back and seemed to see two men and women who sacrificed themselves for love waving to him. He secretly compared his environment with Jufeng's, and couldn't help but feel a little chilled. He knew that this kind of "loving enough to harm" love, judging from the evolution of ordinary things, Jufeng would inevitably receive a major stimulus and pain in the future, or even die without a good end.</p>

<h3>A Good Opportunity for China's Film Industry in the Hollywood Slump - Yao Yinzong</h3>
<p>Movies are greatly related to the future of national culture; they are not merely for people's entertainment. Our China was previously just the end of the foreign film market, and the amount of money exported each year was also quite alarming. As for foreign films imported into our country, those from Hollywood, USA, accounted for the majority. However, since the evil tide of the economic panic broke through the so-called "Kingdom of Gold," Hollywood was also affected. Therefore, those who operated the film industry had to implement a contraction policy, hence the move to reduce the salaries of actors.</p>
<p>As a result, American films produced in the future may be reduced accordingly; although there are other countries' films (such as German Ufa, etc.) that can replace them, their power cannot catch up with the United States. Moreover, other countries are also encountering the same slump, and may not be able to produce many films in the future.</p>
<p>For our backward Chinese film industry, this is a heaven-sent opportunity to revitalize and work hard. I wonder if the general operators of this industry in our country also have this feeling and this desire?</p>
<p>Here, I must exhaust my sincere feelings and advise the Chinese film industry: If we do not want to take this opportunity to expand, then that is it. Otherwise, we must examine the shortcomings of the past as a target for our current efforts. Now, please let me state what I feel are the shortcomings:</p>
<p>First, the material of the film is either "stale" or "vulgar." The material of the film is related to the life of the film. Whether a film has value depends on whether it has life; because film is also an art, and art is something that has life. "Stale" or "vulgar" films have fallen into the trap of "childishness" and cannot be appreciated by the general public. Even if there are some people who lack knowledge of film and welcome and appreciate it, it is only a temporary phenomenon. This kind of film is something that has no life; those who operate the film industry must try to avoid these two malaises in the future when choosing materials, and must plan from the "new and innovative" perspective. The so-called "new and innovative" material is nothing more than having "timeliness." What is the current era? What kind of films does this era need? That is the material to choose. Be sure not to only care about making money and forget the mission you have.</p>
<p>Second, actors lack cultivation. The quality of the actors is really greatly related to the life of the film. All good actors must have a full cultivation of film, and they will be able to maintain the life of this film. It is an undeniable fact that Chinese film actors lack cultivation. Even the few so-called "stars" that exist now are merely promoted. It must be known that foreign film actors have their own real acting skills. Although there are people who promote the show, they never rely solely on people's promotion.</p>
<p>If we can earnestly work hard to reflect on and transform the two points mentioned above, then there is hope of success in the foreign film industry slump, and we can earn respect for "domestic films"; if we only hold the concept of taking this opportunity to compete with foreign films for business, and forget the pros and cons of the film itself—only care about making money and disregard the value of the film, that is abandoning one's personality and ruining one's reputation, which is absolutely unacceptable, and there will be no good results afterwards. May the Chinese film industry encourage each other! Cherish and work hard! (Lack of compensation)</p>
<h3>Film Review - Review of "The Rich Are Real Ways With Us" - Ling He</h3>
<p>Mediocre director, good acting</p>
<p>This kind of film can be considered a sketch of the lives of the upper class. In their lives, the love drama is of course an indispensable pattern. In this film, a socialite has an ambiguous relationship with another woman because her husband had one, and actually married that woman. So after she divorced her husband, she also hooked up with another man. But she and her husband still can't sever the so-called marital affection, so the contradictory mood really made her suffer, until she married a new husband on the one hand, and served her old husband's illness at the same time.</p>
<p>Originally, a film that mainly depicts the inner heart is very likely to make the actors work hard but not succeed easily. In this film, we can get full proof. However, this is to say that the director is mediocre, if there is a good director, who can seize the center of gravity of the script, then at least there should be some wonderful places. But the director of this film did not have a good way to describe this plot. He can only stupidly focus only on the protagonist, but can not catch better matching in other aspects. If we admit that the socialite's actions are worthy of sympathy, then at least her ex-husband is somewhat worthy of love. So we must be able to better describe her ex-husband, so that the painful mood of the socialite can be fully expressed, otherwise, no matter how hard the protagonist works, it will not give the audience any impression. Moreover, he did not have a good connection with the system of the whole article, and the audience must pay full attention to each line to understand the progress of the plot. Of course, this is not only a matter of editing, but the director is too concerned about the advantages of sound films, and ignores the inherent form of films. However, the director's cleverness, we can always see in many small places, such as Julian holding the telephone receiver to sleep, Caroline's reluctance to damage the photos, the pin outside the door, and a night in the room! Intimate shot. But just like that, it's definitely not enough.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we know that the loose and reluctant structure of the script is also a very obvious fact. Although a socialite's love for her own is not necessarily too casual. But why would her completely useless ex-husband be worthy of her nostalgia? And why would she be so confused about such a future husband? And it is so loose, unable to directly tell the audience the progress of the plot with the picture. That is to say, in terms of meaning, in addition to drawing a simple outline for this group of people, they cannot tell the audience any more meaningful intentions. In addition to drinking and gambling all day long, they also need to mess around in love, that's all.</p>
<p>However, Ruth Chatterton's performance is good, she is very able to realistically describe the so-called socialite first-class woman. Although because the director is not good, she did not get a chance to fully develop in the play, but she is still okay. It is a pity that there are more of the same actions, and the facial expressions are not enough. The rest such as George Brent are also okay. So the performance of this film is generally good.</p>
<h3>Audience Opinions - Thoughts After Watching the Soul of the Nation - Yu Yiqing</h3>
<p>Perhaps my knowledge is shallow; I have never seen such uplifting descriptions in a film before. Today, in "The Soul of the Nation" I was given a rewarding experience: Ah! What a pleasant thing this is!</p>
<p>If the small and weak nations that are oppressed by modern imperialists can learn half the spirit of Timour in the film, it will be enough for him to enjoy a heroic life!</p>
<h3>"The Sympathy of the World's Human Race" is in This Film, Introducing "The Shout of Women" - Yang Xiu</h3>
<p>Screenplay and Director: Shen Xiling</p>
<p>The story of the script of "The Shout of Women" probably depicts a female student from a small propertied family, named Ye Yun, who had lofty ambitions and very distant hopes during her school days; however, she soon suffered an unexpected blow, which caused her family to be ruined and her death, leaving her and her young sister alone. After that, forced by life, she began to step into society. "The Shout of Women" depicts the tearful history of Ye Lian's hard struggle in the dark forces of the social environment.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Wang Ying plays Ye Lian. The male lead is Gong Jianong. In addition to the two of them, there is also a leading actor, the young star Zhang Minyu.</p>
<p>We know that Mr. Shen Xiling's directing film is the first time; Wang Ying's appearance on the screen is also the first time. No matter how the results of the "debut film" of these two newcomers are, I think it can always give the audience a little "new" meaning?</p>
<p>A scene from "The Shout of Women"</p>
<p>"A decadent person with backward thinking," "A true color revealing hot blood," "A hypocritical inner layer of crown." But unfortunately, it is not reflected on the self-willing submission of the pseudo-emperor: or it is reflected to the warlords who mislead the country and sell the country, who do not resist, otherwise, it can also kick awake a few points of puppet dreams and remind him a few points of "human" heart.

<h3>Methods to Raise Silver Prices</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 10th – The New York Tribune's Washington dispatch states that Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador Lindsay yesterday discussed ways to raise silver prices. It is reported that the authorities intend to discuss various possibilities for international action on the silver issue when British Prime Minister MacDonald and representatives of other countries visit the United States. The methods of raising silver prices discussed by Hull and the British Ambassador yesterday include at least three: (1) Limiting the production of silver, while also restricting the Indian government from selling existing silver; (2) Major countries around the world increasing the use of silver coins; (3) Major countries on the gold standard, or those wishing to restore the gold standard, purchasing silver according to a prescribed quantity until the silver price reaches a certain level, and including the purchased silver in the central bank's reserves, without stipulating a specific ratio between gold and silver. It was also discussed that silver is mostly a by-product of other metals, so limiting the production of copper, tin, and other minerals should also be considered as part of the process of raising prices.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 10th – President Roosevelt now views Canada as the country most suitable for the United States to negotiate a reciprocal agreement with as a model for agreements with other countries. Canadian Prime Minister Bennett will visit Washington after British Prime Minister MacDonald arrives. The United States plans to discuss tariffs and restrictions on wheat production with Canada. Argentina will also participate in discussions on restricting wheat production, and Soviet Russia may also join. It is now reported that Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador Lindsay did discuss issues such as the gold standard, silver prices, and shipping subsidies. Hull did not ask Britain to immediately restore the gold standard, but it is reported that the British Ambassador also acknowledged the need to stabilize currencies. It is also reported that Hull did not express agreement with the British criticism of the United States for subsidizing shipping.</p>
<h3>Proposed Song Ziwen to Attend</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th – The U.S. President has invited Britain, France, Germany, Italy, China, Japan, and other countries to a conference in Washington to discuss world economic issues. Shi Zhaoji has telegraphed Nanjing to report that we have decided to send important personnel to participate. The government prefers Song Ziwen as the representative and will make a decision after obtaining his consent. In addition to discussing the plan to revive the world economy, the scope of this conference will also include discussions on disarmament and the Far East issue.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th – According to sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the U.S. government's invitation to the Prime Ministers of Britain, France, Italy, and other countries to the United States to discuss economic conferences was communicated verbally through the State Department to the embassies of the respective countries in the United States. If the Prime Ministers themselves cannot come in person, they may send representatives to participate. British Prime Minister MacDonald has decided to attend in person. Our Minister to the United States, Shi Zhaoji, also received a formal invitation from the U.S. State Department the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Air Force</h3>
<p>Famous Italian Aviator Agrees to be an Instructor</p>
<p>Rome – Renowned Italian aviator, Bai Nadai, has accepted an invitation from the Chinese government to train the Chinese Air Force. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>A telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is faintly heard that the U.S. government's intention in inviting representatives from various countries to the United States is to (1) observe the attitudes of various countries towards the matters discussed at the economic conference; (2) exchange opinions on the issue of world economic recovery, in order to demonstrate the U.S. government's determination to break the economic downturn. The exchange of opinions between the U.S. government and the representatives of various countries will be held separately and will not take the form of a conference.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Send Takahashi</h3>
<p>Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 10th – The U.S. government has requested Japan to send a representative for preparatory negotiations for the World Economic Conference to be held in Washington. According to Ambassador Debuchi's report, the U.S. hopes the following from this convening of the conference: 1. The U.S. hopes for the success of the World Economic Conference and requests that major countries begin preparatory negotiations in advance; 2. The representatives sent by each country must be of the highest caliber to emphasize the importance of the preparatory negotiations; 3. In addition to discussing economic and financial issues, this conference will primarily address war debts and disarmament, which are fundamental to the world economic problem, so it is hoped that countries will send figures of Prime Minister level; 4. The Japanese representative should not only represent the economic conference but also serve as an envoy for Japan-U.S. amity; 5. The preparatory meeting will not take the form of a conference, and representatives from various countries do not need to arrive in Washington at the same time. The Japanese representative can arrive in the U.S. at the end of May.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 10th – After Japan implemented its withdrawal from the League of Nations, its foreign relations have become increasingly isolated, and the national sentiment is unusually depressed. In order to break through this environment, special importance is attached to the World Economic Conference. The reasons are as follows: 1. Using the World Economic Conference to alleviate the domestic economic crisis; 2. Planning to take the opportunity to raise the issue of recognizing the puppet state of Manchukuo; 3. Utilizing this opportunity to encourage European and American countries to invest in Japan and Manchuria, to avoid financial bankruptcy and the inability to achieve the purpose of aggression against China. Based on the above reasons, the Japanese government gladly expressed its participation and intends to send the country's top politicians to participate in the conference. According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the candidates recommended by the Japanese government are Finance Minister Takahashi. If Takahashi insists on not going, Internal Minister Yamamoto will be recommended instead. If both elders are unwilling to participate, powerful representatives will be selected from among the senior officials to attend the conference. This is enough to show the Japanese government's intentions.</p>
<h3>New York Newspapers Give High Praise</h3>
<p>Havas, New York, 9th – The New York Times published an editorial studying the situation in Washington before the World Economic Conference, where talks have not yet begun. It stated that the Hoover government had declared that the U.S. would not allow the discussion of war debts and tariff issues at the World Economic Conference. This attitude has been criticized by all parties, who believe that the path to these two most important issues has been blocked by the U.S. However, after President Roosevelt took office, the situation completely changed. Roosevelt is willing to discuss tariff and war debt issues with various countries and has invited countries with commercial relations to participate. After Roosevelt initiated the "rehearsal" of the World Economic Conference, the arduous responsibilities of diplomats from various countries should be greatly facilitated. As a rule, foreign governments first seek the interests of their own countries and then allow the world's nations to share the remaining benefits. This time, President Roosevelt acted in the opposite way and only devoted himself to the greater and more distant goals. This is something we should all applaud and celebrate.</p>

<h3>Explanation of the Significance of the Central Executive Committee's Circular Telegram Convening the National Congress Due to Misunderstandings by Tang Shaoyi and Others</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee sent a telegram to the provincial and municipal party headquarters and comrades on the 9th, saying, "All comrades in the provincial and municipal party headquarters, please note: Having read the telegrams from Committee Member Tang Shaoyi and Committee Member Hu Hanmin, there are many misunderstandings about the Central Standing Committee's intention to convene a temporary National Congress. A special explanation is provided to inform all comrades. According to the regulations of the Outline of National Reconstruction, the convocation of the National Congress was originally intended to occur after more than half of the provinces in the country had completed local autonomy. However, for several years, the country has not been truly unified. Coupled with the disturbances of the Communist bandits and the aggression of the violent Japanese, local autonomy cannot proceed as scheduled. The Third Plenary Session of last winter, in light of this, resolved to convene the National Political Consultative Council in October of this year and the National Congress in April of the 24th year. It is clear that the convocation of the National Congress cannot be delayed due to the slow progress of local autonomy. In executing the resolution, the Standing Committee carefully considered that the convocation of the National Congress is only two years away. These two years will be devoted to completing local autonomy, but with the national crisis at hand, it is even more urgent to gather the will and talents of the people of the whole country to jointly solve it. The outbreak of the national crisis is due to the aggressive policies of the violent Japanese, which have been brewing for decades and suddenly erupted. The Party is in power and cannot shirk its responsibility. Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the whole country have been heartbroken by foreign insults and have strived to resist. As a result, they eagerly hope to participate in political power as soon as possible to exert their abilities. The Party cannot ignore these passionate demands. The slogan of sincere unity to jointly overcome the national crisis has spread throughout the Party and the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country are eager for the unity of the Party to deal with the enemy, and the Party is even more eager for the unity of the people of the whole country to unite their will and overcome difficulties together. This situation is urgent and cannot wait for two years. This is the reason why the Standing Committee proposed to convene the National Congress ahead of schedule. The Third Plenary Session had already resolved to convene the National Congress in April of the 24th year. Now, if we want to change the resolution, we can only convene the National Congress. According to the Party Constitution, the National Congress is held every two years. The Fourth National Congress was held in November of the 20th year, so the Fifth National Congress should be held in November of this year. However, the Fourth Plenary Session has already resolved to convene the National Political Consultative Council in October of this year. If the Fifth National Congress is convened at a time not far apart, it will inevitably be criticized for being redundant. Therefore, it is better to convene a temporary National Congress on July 1st to discuss and decide on the issue of convening the National Congress ahead of schedule. If it is decided to convene, then the preparatory committee for the National Political Consultative Council will be changed to the preparatory committee for the National Congress. Time and economy can be saved in both ways. This is the reason why the Standing Committee decided to convene a temporary National Congress on July 1st. All of these discussions are simple and clear, without any doubt. As for resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists, regardless of whether the National Congress is convened or not, our determination to proceed firmly remains unchanged. Not only will the convocation of the two conferences not slacken our efforts, but the convocation of the two conferences will make our efforts even greater and more powerful. This is what we dare to say resolutely. We sincerely inform all comrades for their consideration. Central Executive Committee, Cyan Seal. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Chen Guofu Reports</p>
<p>How to Revive the Countryside</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Memorial Week was held on the morning of the 10th, with a total of over 500 attendees, including Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Ju Zheng, Chu Minyi, Huang Jichen, Zhang Ji, Hong Ludong, and staff. Because Li Shizeng went to Shanghai, Chen Guofu gave the report (How to Revive the Countryside) instead. The gist of the report was that although the prices of agricultural products have increased three or four times compared to decades ago, the lives of farmers are still very difficult, and the countryside is increasingly bankrupt. The reason for this is that the prices of other goods are extremely high, so the income of farmers is not enough to cover their basic costs and labor. Most people say that to help the countryside, we should start by improving seeds and increasing production, but the prerequisite for reviving the countryside is: (1) Actively carry out water conservancy projects; (2) Stipulate the minimum prices of agricultural products to maintain the costs of farmers; (3) Organize financial institutions suitable for the needs of farmers; (4) Encourage and assist farmers in engaging in side businesses during the slack season. Only in this way can we save the bankruptcy of the countryside. Other industries and commerce will also prosper as a result. Then, all major national salvation plans will be effective. Otherwise, if the rural organization collapses, the country will perish without even waiting for foreign invasion. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 a.m. after the speech.
