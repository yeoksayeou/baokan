<p>時評</p>
<h3>歐洲四强國協定·晦</h3>
<h3>（一）墨索里尼提議</h3>
<p>英國首相麥唐納於本月十八日偕英外相西門秉飛機赴意。與黑衣宰相共商如何挽救歐洲當前之危局。墨索里尼提議歐洲四大强國丨英法意德丨協定。意在增進非戰公約之精神。策勵歐洲與世界之和平。其協定内容。全文尙未完全發表。而其大意。要不外爲保持歐洲和平。修改洛加洛條約及凡爾賽和約。承認德意志之軍備平等……。借此可以减輕德法衝突。緩和法意對立。而謀打開今日歐洲各國經濟窒息之難局。救濟當前政治之危機也。</p>
<p>緣去年六月中旬洛桑會議。减低德國應付賠欵至於三十億馬克後。當時世界資本主義各國。均以此爲更生之機。英法旣顯示其寬大。德國亦表見其偉業。從此賠償「癌腫」切開。繁榮回復。端賴經濟之次第好轉。國際糾紛。雖未就絶跡。而洛桑協定之爲佳善動因。則應無疑義矣。加之北美合衆國選舉運動之刺激。一般工商業。頓呈活躍。其有助於世界經濟之回蘇。阻遏國際關係之惡化。料必不少。乃不意事過境遷。賠償問題縱告一段落。而凡爾賽和約。依然存在。法蘭西之於「安全保障。」更不肯輕易放鬆。且國際間關稅壁壘。仍各自繼增築。於此欲以自給自足之鎖國政策。防止外國製造品之侵入。希冀其國内市塲之鞏固。經濟之發展。其可得乎。以故事實上表現。各國國内市塲。莫不日就衰頽。關稅高築。非特不足以興盛本國市塲。反影響海外銷路。（因對手國亦施之以報復關稅·致令輸出縮减·）海軍强力。更不能清除存貨。迫人以必須購買。由是經濟恐慌愈激。政治變化愈大。亦爲情勢所必然。加以日本軍國主義者盲目猛進。逞一時開拓疆土之貪欲。不惜種百年之禍因。借口特殊利益。製造滿洲傀儡。我中國固首蒙其禍。而世界經濟平衡。亦因此感受莫大影響。市塲愈加縮小。政治危機。愈加深刻。軍備競賽乃亦更見激烈矣。</p>
<h3>（二）軍事矛盾展開政治關係惡化</h3>
<p>「和平」與「安寗。」固爲人人所需求。亦爲當世各國所提倡。縱令窮極反動之流。亦不致獨倡異議。然而事實之來。往往與其理想相反。而人類歷史。輒多在禍亂動搖之波浪中。往復循環無寗日。即以世界第一次大戰而論。歐洲大陸主要各國。其受敎訓也。不可謂不切。其被禍也不可謂不深。而西歐各國政治家。於過去十年中亦曾努力於和平。乃結果相反。國際形勢。竟愈趨惡化。表面之平衡·亦將　不保。且也閉關鎖國。到處風行。國民主義。瀰漫一時。戰爭之惡魔。遂成長其中。世界之危機。竟不能以和平方法謀清算。　欲以戰爭手段求結論。亦可慨也</p>
<p>希特勒掌握政權以來。爲期不及兩月。「萬字旗」所指。一面蹂躪其威瑪爾憲法。一面集結其挺進隊。向德法間中立地帶突進。非特欲實行破棄凡爾賽和約。且大有對法挑釁之意味。雖經法國抗議。而德外長牛乃茲之答覆。則諉爲德國國内問題。此雖未必即成爲引火物。而法德間之惡感。勢將因此愈甚矣。但澤自由市。界乎德波之間。兩國關係。素欠妥洽。最近警報頻傳。形勢確甚緊張。更有自蘇聨分離烏克蘭之隠謀。似此德波國交險惡之外。又益之以德蘇不協。國社黨當政。對蘇關係惡化。自在意料之中。而希特勒與墨索里尼結合。形成第二度之三角同盟。與法蘇相對抗。則依然還原於世界大戰前夜之舊狀。如斯種種不吉之豫兆。能不令人心危。</p>
<p>更有甚者。英人六名在莫斯科被捕。其影響於英蘇國交。亦非淺鮮。蘇聨當局。外交宿稱敏捷。對於此次事件。寗不加以深切之考量。且薩拉齊子彈一發。即引動歐洲空前未有之惡劇。現在軍縮會議。正在風雨飄颻之中。英首相麥唐納乃怱怱赴意。對中歐險惡政局。不遑旁顧。而與意相墨索里尼談判結果。遂有四國協定丨求軍備平衡丨之提示。法國於此。豈能不顧慮其覇權動搖。而以各小國受損爲言耶。然而歐陸各國。自法蘭西以至意大利德意志。莫不痛感經濟疲弊。失業成羣。與存貨山積之矛盾擴大。此時又安妄事戰爭。故英意兩首相會商後之提議。或能就萬分困頓中。求得一時期之休息。博取短期間之和平。亦未可知也。</p>
<p>墨索里尼新計劃</p>
<h3>法主張根據國聨精神</h3>
<h3>歐洲四强推誠合作</h3>
<p>德意志法西斯蒂主義狂熱</p>
<p>法反對修改和約態度益堅</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今晚英使署發表一文、言及英法兩國總揆與外交當局間之、、謂法國當局欲就國聨之結榸與精神内爲和平利益計、成立歐洲四强間之忠實合作、此四國者、乃國聨之永遠會員也、法總理達拉第與外長彭古得英當道所供給之情報、得以對於英意提議作更密切之研究、故向當道道謝、並允趕速彼此交換意見云（廿一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法國政治家今日繼續研究意相墨索里尼之歐洲和平公約提議、但聞法總理達賴第反對修改凡爾賽和約或其他和約、以成此公約、據稱、達氏與麥唐納俱以爲墨索里尼新計劃倘屬可以實行者、則其條文應符合國聨盟約之精神與結構、而麥唐納又力主此時不宜撇開國際聨盟、至歐洲各地盛傳法國在原則上接受墨氏提議之說、已由此間當道否認、謂目下正從事研究意相計劃、達氏必須赴羅馬與意相當面詳談後、始能决定、又據外交界意見、照目前之四國公約計劃、或須修改和約、而觀於今日之德國政局、法當局將反對修改和約云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>英法談話備極歡洽</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　英相麥唐納·外相西門、與法總理達拉第·外長彭古等、在英大使館會談、自午前十一時半起、至午後一時十分暫停、英國閣員以羅馬方面英意談話、報告法國當局、雙方討論情形、極形歡洽、午後三時、英法兩國要人、又開始研究英意計劃之内容、至五時四十五分始畢、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　英相麥唐納於會議後語客、英國旣不爲任何預定的軍縮計劃所拘束、亦不因與意相墨索里尼會議之結果、而爲修正和約計劃所束縳云、客詢以是否已在羅馬草擬維持歐洲和平之任何計劃、英相答稱、確曾議定許多提議、但報紙所載之羅馬計劃、並未確有根據、謠言繁多、渠倦於闢謠、羅馬公報所言及英法德意四强之合作中、絶對未有取國聨而代之之意云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>歐洲和平門戶開啓</h3>
<p>麥唐納昨離巴黎返國</p>
<p>法總揆將作倫敦之行</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英法德意四强協定之計畫、一時不致續有發展、因英法政治家昨在巴黎談話後、英首相麥唐納外相西門將於今日乘飛機回國、以經過情形報告内閣也、聞現已將門戶開啓、俾法總理達拉第外長彭古可於日内至倫敦繼續討論、此項計畫就意國參衆兩院所予首相墨索里尼之熱烈歡迎觀之、顯受意國朝野之贊助、但英國下院則須候麥唐納向之詳細解釋後、再有行動、今有一事可决者、即英國在歐洲之擔任如有所增重、必不爲下院所贊同是、此項計畫已使兩週來歐洲之緊張爲之鬆弛、並使和平之維持復有希望、此實毫無疑義、惟德國雖有贊成之表示、但波資丹昨日國會開幕時所暴露之國家主義的狂熱、及德總理希特勒一再否認德國爲歐戰之罪魁、顯均不合時宜也、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　英相麥唐納偕其女薏散倍爾及西門外相、於今晨九時在蒲爾越飛機塲、乘坐四馬達之飛機屋拉休斯號、遵由英法航空路線歸英、法國航空部長谷脫到塲送行、麥相等於十點五十一分安抵英國克勞登飛機塲、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>軍縮總委將暫延會</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　軍縮會議主席漢德森與主席團會商之後、决定於星期四總委員會開會時、向其建議、將軍縮會議暫行停止、至復活節以後、再行開會、蓋最近意相提出計劃、英法尙在磋商、故軍縮會議須暫行停止也、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國内部赤禍潛滋</h3>
<p>麥唐納赴羅馬作用</p>
<p>傳與對付蘇聨有關</p>
<p>（倫敦）　據傳此次英首相麥唐納赴意晤意首相墨索里尼、除救濟垂危之軍縮會議外、暗中尙有一大作用、此間且曾一度謠傳、英之麥唐納意之墨索里尼及德之希特勒三巨頭將會晤於意大利馬迭烏蘭湖畔之期脫萊沙市、共謀匡救時局之說、蓋今日之英國内部、有赤色恐怖之暗影潛躍在、最近莫斯科共産黨曾有重要之密令指令英國共産黨、其内容爲在一九三六年五月、在英國發起赤色革命、樹立蘇維埃政府、在今後三年間、力謀秘密運動之尖銳化、注全力於赤化英國陸海軍與警察之工作、此陰謀於本月十二日之倫敦每日快報上揭載後、引起全倫敦人士之大注意、英蘇關係之惡化、最近蘇政府逮捕僑蘇英商即爲其序幕、此次麥唐納之赴意、蓋與對付蘇俄之事有關云、（世界社）</p>
<p>日本政變醖釀聲中</p>
<h3>齋藤尙圖戀棧</h3>
<p>（東京訊）　在最近日本政潮醖釀聲中、本屆議會終了後、現内閣即將總辭職之說、甚囂塵上、對此、齋藤首相最近有决意之表示、以爲處此非常時期、現内閣自認其使命尙未終了、故雖議會終了後、亦不引退、仍將繼續留職、爲鞅掌之國務効勞、蓋在國際聨盟脫退後之自主的外交未確立、國家財政經濟基礎未穏固、軍部所統制之重大案件未解决以前、現内閣之使命尙未完成也、（世界社）</p>
<p>（東京）　高橋財長今日九時訪齋藤首相、密談約一小時、兩相會見不在豫算問題、高橋財長料有相當發表意見、所談内容雖未公開、然商議確係對國會終結後之下台時期與卸責問題、齋藤與高橋會見後、即親訪山本内相璃密議國會後之進退問題、齋藤首相並預定國會後、即赴興津訪問西園寺公爵、名目上雖謂報告國會經過、實際上即爲商議後繼内閣之問題、政界方面揣測、齋藤内閣運命脫不了五月中之難關、（二十二日華聨電）</p>
<p>俄新使訪内田</p>
<h3>重提不侵條約</h3>
<p>仍無結果而退</p>
<p>（東京）　駐日俄大使今日訪内田外長、提起俄日不侵犯條約、内田外長答謂、俄日「滿」委員會須先加以相當考慮、由三國合作、可以達到俄日不侵犯目的、俄國若肯考慮該案、日對不侵犯條約、當即進行切實之討論云、於是俄日不侵犯條約又是不得良好結果而散（廿二日華聨電）</p>
<p>日樞府新發勦</p>
<h3>外交直屬天皇</h3>
<p>倡設外交調本會</p>
<p>（東京）　最近各方面要求設立如外交參謀本部之機關、以决定關於外交之國是、並從速處理外交問題、樞府曾在寺内内閣時主張設立天皇直轄之外交調查會以達此目的、今次日本退出國聨後須要澈底實行自主外交、並使列國承認日本在國聨會議未能主張之正義的立塲、爲此目的設立如外交調查會之大機關、實行强硬外交爲絶對必要之事、樞府最近關於此問題、非公式對政府傳達樞府内部之意見、政府似在考慮中、（二十二日日聨電）</p>
<p>德國人士關心</p>
<h3>日委治地問題</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　現由日本委任統治之太平洋前德國殖民地、在日本退出國聨會以後將如何處置、此一問題極爲德國政府人士所關心、據半官式消息稱、德國意見、以爲日本明白宣言主張繼續行使太平洋諸島之委任統治權一事、已引起一非常嚴重之問題、此問題對於德國有重大之關係、倘就國際觀點以解决之、則解决此問題題之權限、當屬諸國聨會行政院及委任統治委員會、又謂國聨會接受該問題時、德國將出而辯護其立場云、（廿二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國聨特會之重行召集（下）</h3>
<p>然十九國委員會、同時並指出盟約第十五條第四節之規定、僅大會得有權援用、故中日雙方如再有任何提議、仍可送達十九委會考慮、故一方面雖已依照十五條第四節之規定準備報告、一方面則和解之途、仍未隔絶也、</p>
<p>在本報告書草擬之時、日本代表團又有新建議送達委員會、其所擬之修正各點、雖已較十二月間及一月間所提出者爲少、惟尙有疑點、有關此等修正案之意義（尤其關於對第一草案第四節之修正）、甚鉅、故有請日代表團解釋之必要、按第一决議案草案原文規定成立一委員會、其責職爲與爭議雙方根據、</p>
<p>調查團報告書第九章之原則、並注意同報告書第十章之建議、共同進行解决本案之談判、而日本代表團所提出之更正案、則稱「十九委員會應負責、努力與爭議雙方、共同取得解决本案之和解方法、其獲得之方法、應以調查團報告書第九章之原則及結論爲根據、而將此項原則及結論、援用於已經發展之事件、</p>
<p>十九委員會以爲日本此項建議、其範圍似應加以明白之規定、蓋若根據一種誤解而開始進行、解决方法、則對國聨及國聨會員均爲不合也、中國對滿洲現當局已明確解釋其意見矣、行政院所派赴當地調查之調查團、於此亦已確切解釋其性質矣、而在迭次大會辯論中、一般意見、亦均信本案之解决、應就調查團報告書第九章所聲述之原則中求之、然則日本政府是否接受國聨之一般意見乎、抑仍堅持其首次送達修正案時之見解、主張第七第八兩原則應不予置議乎、十九委員會爲避免誤會計、即向日本提出質問、日本政府是否認調查團報告書第九章第七原則爲和解根據之一、此項質問、係於二月八日向日本代表團提出、</p>
<p>日本代表團接受上項質問後、即於同月十四日答稱、日本政府深信遠東和平之唯一保證、厥爲「滿洲國」之維持及承認、而中日爭議全案、終將依此根據而解决、十九委員會於此、雖萬分遺憾、亦不能不認爲其和解之努力、已經用盡而無能再爲力矣、</p>
<p>以上種種、即國聨今日當前之形勢也、一九三一年九月二十一日以來、行政院在前、大會在後、努力依照盟約規定、追求能使雙方同意之解决方案、迄今恰爲十七個月、當爭端初起時、行政院即受日方保證、當時已在開始之日軍之撤回南滿鐵路區一事、當在可能範圍内最迅速的完成之、</p>
<p>今日者、東三省已被佔據、日本軍隊直長城而攻擊山海關、而進佔熱河之活動、亦據稱正在準備中矣、</p>
<p>夫本案之和解方法、在大會依照盟約第十五條第四節之規定通過報告書前、當然尙未能認爲已經斷絶、然余殊不願再籲請雙方再作和解之努力、蓋此着欲求其成功、則非特應先有能使大會接受之新建議、且大會非先得現在狀况不致再趨嚴理及軍事行動不致再發生之保證不可也、</p>
<p>惟余殊不願即提議請大會今日即考慮此項報告書、在此嚴重之候、吾人自不應草率從事、該報告書甫於上星期五分送各會員、自應予各國政府以充分時間、俾可傳達訓令於其代表團、余意大會可於下星期五即二十四日重開、以開始討論此報告書草案也可、」</p>
<p>細味上文、雖未明白責斥日本、而破壞調解之罪、固已無可逃矣、（二月二十二日寄於日内瓦）</p>

<h3>發表新黃禍論</h3>
<p>因受日本商業上之威脅</p>
<p>據十六日大阪朝日新聞載稱、最近英國　維業者、對於日本人造絲之飛躍、非常恐慌、自由黨系之晚報十四日發表「新黄禍論」略謂日本之棉布、不獨奪東洋印度之貿易、甚至侵入英國之市場、而英國之人造絲、更受其重大打擊、日本之生産額、在六年前、本爲世界之第九位、去年變爲第四倍、今年竟次於美國、占世界第二位、其輸出額、在五年以前、英國本超出日本之八位、去年日本反較英國增多三倍、推其所以致此之由、皆因勞資低廉故也、英國之女工多日本八倍、男工十倍、因此大受影響、至於關稅障壁、本不成問題、由此觀之、誠如前德皇所警告之黄禍、今將實現矣、蓋日本以低廉工資、脅迫産業文明之危險、實比其軍事的威脅爲尤甚、欲保持國民生活合理的標準各國、應採取不許以奴隸的勞動所造之物資、輸入國内云云、</p>

<h3>瀋陽歸客談</h3>

<p>大通社記者、頃晤方由瀋陽潛逃來滬之王茂盛君於逆旅、承告以日軍對付東北民衆慘狀、點點血淚、令人不忍卒聞茲特分誌如後、</p>
<p>僞國内部現狀　王君首言、最近日軍因攻喜峰口、迭受我軍巨創後、駐防僞國各地日軍、均已奉令開往熱河者、達三師團以上、以致僞國内部防務、異常空虚、各地僅有少數日憲兵、及附逆之華軍、以維持地方秩序、自日軍慘敗消息、傳抵滿洲後、僞組織之大小官員、紛起恐慌、加之化整爲零之義勇軍、潛伏各地、入夜輒鳴槍示威、更使僞國官吏、寢不安席、僞軍下税爲强自鎭靜起見、即禀准日最高軍事當局、由朝鮮調來憲兵四千餘名、派赴各地、監視民衆、以防與義軍暗通聲氣、乘虚襲擊、同時日方軍事當局、深恐附逆軍發生不穏行動、更密派日軍、在附逆華軍附近、紮營駐守、名曰協助維持治安、實是予以監視、至於日僑方面、因鑒於處境危險、亦自動組織自警團、巴於本月初、正式成立、團員約計五百餘人、槍械則領自僞軍政部、本月十四日、僑軍政部因迭接熱河日軍戰敗電報、立即宣佈特别戒嚴、一至下午五時、即不許居民外出、在白晝時、街上行人、不准有三人互相談話、否則即以擾亂治安、煽惑人心治罪、處以極刑、其恐慌之態度、蓋已達於極點矣、</p>
<p>嚴禁自由出入　王君又謂、滿洲僞組織、最近對於居民之自由出入境界、防範甚爲嚴密、其目的係在防止義軍便衣隊潛入内地、凡各地居民之欲出境者、須先詳呈理由、並向當地官廳繳納本人全身小照兩幀、及當地店舖二家之連環保結、</p>
<p>義軍前途堪虞　自熱戰發生後、滿洲日軍事當局、對於各地義軍、即採取屠殺政策、並實行封鎖充杜絶義軍接濟、現散處滿洲各地之義勇軍、雖已化整爲零、潛伏於深山幽谷間、但食糧久已斷絶、僅恃野菜爲生、而日軍搜殺尤不遺餘力、每獲一義軍、即處以五馬分屍、或倒吊樹梢、使其心血下流而死、如遇婦女、年輕者先被侮辱、然後亂刀斫死、年老者、恒施以慘酷刑具而殞命、其凄慘狀態、余（王君自稱）實不忍再言、設我政府當局、不早日收復熱河、打通義軍接濟之路綫者、則此數十萬之中華健兒、行見盡喪於倭寇之手矣、深望我政府諸公、痛下决心、早下全國總動員命令、迅速出關收復失地、以拯救此日處於日軍鐵蹄蹂躪下之四省民衆、及爲國犧牲之數十萬義軍也云云、</p>

<p>（檢查嚴厲狀况）　大連方面、已禁止上海華字報紙輸入、如有夾帶前往、一經搜出、便須重罰、上海赴大連或營口安東中國人、須舉行特别搜檢、除行李物件、一一卸騐外、甚至身上衣服貼邊裏子、及頭上帽子裏子、統須當塲用小刀剖開、由日探檢視、並對陽光照觀、如稍有不符、即認爲間諜、便須捕捉而去、生命便難保全</p>

<h3>師範生的出路</h3>
<p>丨本埠趙寄漁君來信丨</p>
<p>說到師範生的出路問題，自然，在目前中國社會，師範生是被一般人所輕視的，但是，我們也要問一問：師範生本身有没有盡了他應盡的責任？如果放棄了本身的責任而去找出路，無疑義地，是到東「此路不通」，到西也是「此路不通」。師範生本身的責任是什麽呢？我們看看目前中國失學的兒童有多少？我們再看看目不識丁的民衆有多少？我們知道這些民衆和兒童是没有找着出路；那麽，師範生的責任。都盡了没有？撫心自問，師範生如果抛棄了自己的責任，而去尋找其他的出路，必然只有痛苦，只有煩悶。不錯，本身的生活，個個人須得吃飯，這自然是一個切要的問題；可是，師範生是個勞働者，師範生不可能享受優越的物質生活，實際上也享受不着；並且，師範生决不能靠託社會來供養你，你必須做一個社會生産者，同時替社會找出路，所以，師範生的責任，是替社會普及生産敎育。不過，現在的中國社會，這一條路是荆棘滿途，因此師範生必須具有創造的决心，闢荒的膽量，和堅忍的意志，刻苦的精神，來戰勝一切的阻碍。假範生負起了「替社會找出路」的使命，師範生自己才有出路可找，在也是一個師範生，我在社會裏面掙扎着將近十年了。我過去曾經在另一條路上徘徊過。就我最近的生活，說也可算是一個優良的位置，一個小學敎員，每月拿進三四十元的酬報，也着實是不錯的了，可是我心痛，我已經把師範生的責任抛棄了，我只是在做一個雇傭勞働者。這是我的出路，我們師範生的出路嗎？先生說得好：「我們固然不能，餓着肚子去做」負起時代使命的奮鬥「，但你不做這種奮鬥，依然是要餓着肚子」，我現在並不會餓着肚子，但是，我要去做一點，爲社會找出路而奮鬥的工作，去做一個爲社會生産的人。所以我决定在下半年想辭去現有的敎職，丨這裏是一所「爲私人賺錢」的學校丨想去創辦一所爲普及生産敎育的學校，這也是我爲要多負起一點師範生的責任呀！你以爲我的意見怎樣？這一條路能走得通麽，殷君日新，或是其他的同志們，如果能够共同來担負起這師範生的責任，我當然十二分的表示歡迎。我希望讀者，同情我的來指導我，帮助我。</p>
<p>答：足下要辭去「爲私人賺錢」的學校不幹丨想去創辦一所爲普及生産敎育的學校，」其志可嘉，然而所謂「普及生産敎育的學校」究是一種什麽學校？老實說，在現在政治狀况之下，一個赤手空拳的人要辦一個什麽生産敎育的學校，固然是「比登天還難」，即使你勉强辦成了，也不過是上海灘上什麽路，什麽里又多一掛學校的牌子，又多一個「賺錢」欺人的地方。這不盡是由於人的好壞，而是社會與政治環境不容你不如是。依我看來，横豎是做勞動者：與其任學校裏做咬文嚼字的勞働者，不如率性到工廠成公司裏做個體力或半體力的勞働者·在其間反可找到盡你師範生的義務的機會。至於你的信的前面旣說「師範生是個勞働者」，後面又說「我只是一個雇傭勞働者。這是我的出路。我們師範生的出路嗎？」前後話語有點矛盾。其實師範生是没有出中路，要眞有出路，只有師範生自己意識地去做個勞働者，在勞働者中去盡他的師範生的責任。</p>

<h3>孔庸之專使考察的感想</h3>
<p>— 俞洽成</p>
<p>孔庸之先生前膺政府委命，往歐美考察實業，歷時半載，近始返滬。上海工商管理協會特開會歡迎，席間請孔氏報告考察的感想；茲篇所記，乃當時講稿，未及請予修正，故文責仍由記者自負。</p>
<p>此次奉委到國外去考察，適值世界經濟恐慌之秋，所以可說是有幸有不幸，在人家自身無法發展時去參觀，實在看不到好處，可是探尋人家的前轍，明白他們的失敗之因，也不能即說毫無所得。這正等於學醫的必須要經過疑難雜症，才可以增進經騐一般。</p>
<p>照我個人所找到的歐洲不景氣之因，可以分成以下諸項：</p>
<p>（一）大量生産　美國厲行大規模生産，以致生産過剩，許多生産品竟等於廢物。現在停閉的工廠竟無人去顧問，而工人失業所給社會經濟的影響很大，這是最大的原因。</p>
<p>（二）購買無力　因爲失業潮而致社會購買無力，這固然是最大的原因：可是以往消費的不合理，也是造成經濟不景氣的原因。先前美國工人可用分批付現的方法，給了十元便買汽車，五九便買鋼琴，如此的消費不合理，也是我們足以引爲警戒的。</p>
<p>（三）投機事業　在美國投機事業非常風行，一個公司可以隨便發行股票，没有一定的限制，到後來以致五百元的股票祗值五元還没有人要，這是政府要負責任的。</p>
<p>我們看到人家的情形，以後我們足資借鏡的，有以下五方面：</p>
<p>（一）爲要預防生物過剩，除去注意大規模生産以外，對於手工業也應該注意，政府更須有精密的統計，不使生産過剩，對各種事業，加以支配。</p>
<p>（二）要求生産與消費適合，按照消費的調查，分别發展生産事業。</p>
<p>（三）防止投機事業過多。在商業競爭的時候，要停止一切投機事業是不可能的，但應加以限止和取締。</p>
<p>（四）力謀勞資的協調。德國因勞資問題，發生糾紛，更影響到政治上的紛擾：目下中國雖然不會有什麽大的糾紛，但不設法謀勞資間的協調，不求適當的辦法，仍是很危險的。</p>
<p>（五）復興農業，不要偏重工業。已往我因爲中國以農立國，所以主張扶植工商業的發展，現在以事實中得到新的認識，就是如果不復興農業即談不到扶助工業：因爲没有農業，工業就没有原料，農民也没有購買力，所以復興農業是扶助工業的重要生命素。而且，中國的大部分國民是農民，欲求中國安寗，是非復興農業不可。</p>
<p>訪問記</p>
<h3>與新自歐美考察回來之吳藴初君一席談</h3>
<p>— 洽成</p>
<p>「味之素爲什麽能絶跡於市上？」</p>
<p>這當然不能不歸功於味精的發明因爲國貨代用品的發明，比抵制外貨的標語宣言效力大的多呵！所以，在這冰天雪地中·我仍懷着熱烈的心情，去訪問味精發明者吳藴初先生。</p>
<p>被引到辦公室以後，會到這位灰白頭髮的吳先生·風塵滿面，一望而知其歸自歐美。房裏没有什麽裝飾，房外堆着新近裝箱的貨物；辦公桌上幾張請客單和一些計劃書，房中還有幾位男女職員在工作，但是只有鄰屋裏的機器聲打破這裏的沉寂。最使人關心的，自然是味精，所以第一句便直捷了當的問：</p>
<p>「吳先生能不能和我談一些關於味精的事？」</p>
<p>「好！但是那不過是過渡事業。」也是没修飾的回答。</p>
<p>「什麽時候開始做的？」</p>
<p>經過了一番材料的考查，在一本小冊子上找到：「民國十一年吧！」仍舊是簡單的回答。</p>
<p>「經過情形怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「最初從日本貨的調味品中，用化學方法，分晰出牠的成分，便利用這種成分從新配合嘗試。開始時成本很大，不合於商業交易，三月以後，經過了幾次改良才成功的。」</p>
<p>「現在吳先生除去天廚　味精以外，還經營其他事業嗎？」</p>
<p>「還有天原電化廠和熾昌新公司，專製火柴的原料。」</p>
<p>對着這樣的被訪問者，實在有些使我窮於應付，但是在我移轉的試探以後，可引誘起他的話匣了。</p>
<p>「吳先生從歐美考察後的感想如何？」</p>
<p>「我認爲我們化學工業界，應該要做基本工作，不過利息較爲薄弱一點，在商業方面，似乎不大合算，好在天廚　最近力量還可以，所以自己便負起這項責任來。關於製造綠氣的工作·現在已經着手，佈置就緒以後，就可以開始；同時并在進行淡氣的工作，我在國外也曾行許多專家討論過，計劃已經成功。因爲近在的戰爭是物質的戰爭，工業界必須兼顧着國防，要使工業軍備化」。</p>
<p>說過以後，更補充了幾句：「這種事業是義務本位，不是爲着權利着想的，但是商人是以謀利爲目的，所以我對此事件在未開始時已擬有詳盡的預算了。」</p>
<p>說到考察的感想的時候，他告訴了很多關於近今國際工業界的情形，仍舊是從低緩的聲帶中，用簡單而没有修飾的話句表白出來。更談到中國的將來，吳先生的意見：</p>
<p>「在國外的時候，我曾和許多鄙視中國的外國人辯論，我說，中國果能努力十年，大家分工合作，總有很大的希望；不過如果這樣内鬨的自己打自己，那就難說了。」</p>
<p>送别的時候，出人意外的向我說道：</p>
<p>「關於味精請不要多談，因爲這不算是成就，而且我很不願有過當的宣傳。」因爲吳先生還有更有價值的貢獻·（造酸製鹼）在機器聲軋軋中，我走出工厰，重行投身到嘈雜的鬧市。</p>

<h3>值得介紹的國貨火柴公司</h3>
<p>— 虹霓</p>
<p>語云星星之火·勢可燎原。火柴一物，雖然是一樣日用的小品，但間接上很關係民生，且莫覩火柴，是二三枚銅元一包的小事，積之成多，爲數頗可觀，僅火柴統稅而言，全年全國已達數百萬兩，而外貨火柴進口額，海關統計至少二千萬兩以上，其在華設廠，自製以避逸進口稅尙不列内；鳳風牌火柴，在一二八以前，我們到處可以在中國各地傾銷，尤其是上海是銷用鳳風牌總樞紐，國貨火柴到處因受着外貨傾銷和捐稅的剝壓，有閉歇之虞。不久號稱火柴大王之克魯格自殺後，鳳風牌火柴因此之故，在華勢力亦逐漸减滅，國貨火柴大中華公司出之美麗牌，（即名烟牌）隨乘機繼鳳　牌之後盛銷國内。</p>
<p>大中華火柴公司創設於民十九年秋，爲熒昌，鴻生，中華，裕生，四公司合併總經理劉鴻生君，聘請化學博士林天驥，選用國産原料，用最新科學方法製成藥水梗火柴，如美麗，金鷄，保險，五蝠·等牌火柴，較外貨火柴有過之無不及，在滬漢贛鎭蘇皆設製造廠，用自製梗片製造，每年營業額達數百萬，資本最近至增加至三百餘萬，在我國已可算居第一位，以此類推，可知雖微乎其小的東西，亦决不能圖饒倖而存，特誌之以介紹與讀者。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>怎樣是一個健全的國貨推銷員</h3>
<p>— 金頌唐</p>
<p>凡工商業之經營，除内部組織之健全出品之優良外，營業事務之處理，對外推銷之改進，當然也是一個重大關鍵。推銷員負一公司整個營業付託之使命，對一公司有切膚之關係，其應努力推進，槪可想見。際茲舶來貨猖獗，國産品衰落，身爲國貨事業之推銷員，更宜如何注意。爰就管見所及，拉雜與諸君商榷之。</p>
<p>我國舊時商舖，職司營業事務者（俗稱跑街）往往即一店之經手或店夥，彼輩泰半無堅定之目標，無充分之閱歷，至於審察之目光，敏妥之手腕，更遑論矣。於是千年一日，故步自封，周轉呆頓而閉歇，重受倒賬而停業者，比比皆是，至於目睹洋貨充斥，亦祗徒呼負負，不謀抗敵。晚近工商業勃興，社會智識程度趨高，一般固有之老式跑街，當已受其淘汰，然欲求一純粹新思想有主義之推銷員，誠屬鳳毛麟角。不佞服務工商界，十餘年來考事實上之經騐，積下列數點心得，覺國貨推銷員咸應具有此不可缺之條件，茲一一列舉如下甲·態度品行之端莊　推銷員對外接洽，即代表一公司者也，態度穏定，口齒清晰，使對方不生惡影象而致鄙棄，推銷員職司活動，不若内部人員工作之機械，因之與社會接觸亦多，外界環境之惡劣，習俗之不良，每足使推銷員墮落有餘，應具有清醒之思想，堅强之信用，不致同流合汚，爲人所不齒，己身旣屬不利，公司亦蒙名譽之損傷。</p>
<p>乙·意志知識之堅富　態度品行旣需端莊，意志知識亦應充足，推銷員對外營業交往之接觸，裝貨收欵之程序，宜當機立斷，層次分明，切忌一味敷衍，頻生誤會。他若商場習慣，經濟情狀，尤應胸有成竹，意志定則立足穏，知識富則不落人後矣。</p>
<p>丙·眼光手腕之靈活　態度品行及意志知識均已能應付矣，然無深湛精銳之眼光與乎活潑敏捷之手腕，則亦徒然，蓋推銷員所遇之人，各埠皆有，南轅北轍，方言旣不同，習性又各異，非伶琍活動，隨機應變，欲求推廣出品，源源成交，其可得乎？</p>
<p>丁·談話審察之價值　當此農村崩潰，金融凋敝之時，工商業之地位，大有風雨飄搖之槪，兼之内地商人，智力未充，組織散漫，工商界之客賬·誠似風中之燭，故推銷員與顧客談話，頗有審愼注意之價值，店基殷厚與否，内容情形若何，不辭唇舌，筆諸於書，留作放賬之參考，亦即調查信用之捷徑，營業進行，於此有莫大裨益也。</p>
<p>戊·耐勞茹苦之精神　推銷員應對之間，酬酢之中，均有審察之必要，然耐勞茹之精神，亦爲推銷人員之要素。雖烈日驕陽·揮汗如雨，冬日嚴寒，朔風撲面，亦當按日前往，努力工作，庶免消息之隔膜，感情之淡薄也。</p>
<p>當茲商戰競爭之秋，優勝劣敗，全在運籌帷幄，處置得宜，推銷員能任勞耐苦，不計口舌之煩，不畏風雨寒暑之苦，應對則彬彬有禮，發言則流利生動，態度莊嚴誠摯，思想清晰堅定，不腐化，不苟且，即屬成功之要素，國貨前途，實深利賴。</p>
<h3>對於三大公司進一言</h3>
<p>— 椀公</p>
<p>上海是舶來品的中心區，集舶來品之大成的百貨商店，應該是：先施，永安，新新，首屈一指吧？他們的市招和廣告，都標明了「統辦環球貨品」字樣，這不是推銷舶來品的一個鐵證嗎？看了這些市招，我就先抽了一口冷氣！</p>
<p>提倡國貨，固然是全民的責任。但是商家不販賣，人們從何處買呢？不錯；「因爲有買的才會有賣的」，當然他們要拿這兩句話來辯護·但是一定要用外貨的公子哥兒，摩登小姐，究竟是少數。普通人對於外貨和國貨，本來没有什麽成見。因爲商塲上，觸目都是外貨，也就隨便購買外貨。這些人們是很多的。還有一種熱心提倡國貨的人們。想服用國貨，而苦於無處購買，並且没有辨别力，照這種人也不少，這不是商家的責任嗎？</p>
<p>所以談到提倡國貨，商家應該站在第一條戰線，尤其是上海有名的幾　大公司。雖不能說不賣外貨，但是一方面也要顧到自己的市招上「推銷中華土産」的一句話。橱窗上要先儘國貨陳列，除非主顧指明要外貨，要先拿國貨出來。如果這幾　大公司都來實行推銷國貨，我想效力一定是很大的。最後我希望三家大公司。激發天良，也和中國國貨公司一樣，來實行國貨救國。我情願天天走過你的門口，行一個敬禮！</p>

<h3>蝶話</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>世界最長壽的蝴蝶，無過於舊京太常寺中的仙蝶。色黄，大如茶盌，相傳在朱明嘉靖年間歷居至今不死，是三四百年的長壽　蝶。清乾隆帝旣有大常仙蝶詩，後來仙蝶時或出見，宸垣識略鴻雪因緣等書中都記載。</p>
<p>世界最善飛的蝴蝶，産地有二：一，是波羅的海島中所産的大白　蝶，其名呌做「菜白」，往往結成長距離的旅行隊，飛往歐洲各國；經行的時候，半空中宛似紛飛放大的雪片。一，是非洲中部生産的粉蝶號稱「雪娘」，飛翔力尤可驚異！它們會得盈千累百飛過薩哈拉大沙漠，在北非洲迥翔數天以後，還有餘勇繼續北飛，飛到繁華世界的英倫三島。</p>
<p>近讀丹徒李子薪的植庵集，記洪楊之變，江督何桂清擁兵常州，規復失地；忽有一大彩蝶，飛往總督行臺，何氏以爲仙使下凡，，遽設香案，具衣冠拜蝶，且問時局安危。一般諂媚何氏的，都說這是奏凱的預兆。後來，大營潰散，何氏棄職濳逃；當時國法尙嚴，敗軍之將，到底難逃　戮。李子薪有「蝴蝶行」刋集中，其中警句；丨戰門洞達旌旗開，節使冠帶輝行臺，三軍歡聲動天地，花鳥之使來蓬萊。……節使終是念軍國，就蝶焚香問得失，但願尋芳作醉鄉，保護江南好春色。………………</p>
<h3>慢性與急性</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>丨還是慢的好丨</p>
<p>從前有二位大夫盤辮子，勒衣袖的爭論了一番，險些兒各把腦袋兒打開。一位是七世祖傳的儒醫，社會上所謂中國郎中。一位是新從歐洲一個醫科大學畢業的，雖然也是一位眞正老牌，不折不扣的中國種，但是社會上都呌他外國醫生。他們二位衝突的原因，是爲了中國郎中說外國醫生不懂脈理，外國醫生說中國郎中不知解剖。你說我膿包，我駡你混蛋。後來有一位專愛管閒事的和事老出來做好做歹的解勸，說，中醫比較的穏健，西醫比較的敏捷。宛如越過一個山，中醫愛在築就的路上走，西醫愛走荆棘叢中的近路。各有各的長，各走各的路，好在是異途同歸，儘用不到呌花兒容不下討飯。</p>
<p>上述的故事，雖似一個笑話兒，却已十足的表示着中國的慢性，外國的急性。近來我更得到了慢性與急性的很多例證。就以走路一端而論，中國人老是愛在水門汀上大　其臺步，外國人總是急急的似乎火燒在屁股上了。以前我們時常見有走在外國人前面的中國人，給外國人推在一邊，奪路而走的，現在這種無禮而侮辱的舉動，不知是中國人程度高了一些，或是外國人文明了一些，倒不很見得到了，但是在中國人後面的外國人，追過中國人的，還是時常可以見到，再如共赴國難，人家總是連奔帶跳的，中國人也喜歡慢慢地以求穏健·而策萬全。</p>
<p>有人說，外國人性急，中國人性慢，據你說來，中國亡國總也比較的慢，這話對麽？我說，或許也有一些小道理。</p>
<h3>春天到了</h3>
<p>— 野子</p>
<p>丨春天的廣西男女靑年丨</p>
<p>這裏我所要說的是廣西省屬的平樂賀縣鍾山昭平等縣屬的男女靑年在春天裏的情景，雖然，我不敢說他們可以代表廣西全省，但是我總覺得：至少能代表大部份的。</p>
<p>他們一到了春天，就是很得空了，無論窮的富的，在這正月與二月間，都是很清閒的過活。所以在集圩的日子，總有他們紅紅綠綠的痕跡，；有時就跑到山脚或河邊唱「山歌」，男男女女，互相應和，廳說那些歌有些也極悲痛，甚至使他們和伊們互相流淚；可是也有極歡樂的。你想想像那氣候温和的廣西。一到了春天，到處都是人面桃花相映紅了，自然，這輩男女靑年們，也趁着他們在靑春的時候，燃燒着愛的火燄囉！那些歌，大多數是戀歌，可惜我不能記得到那些好的歌兒，祗得將腦裏現時所能記憶的而且不甚好的兩首，抄在下面；</p>
<p>「情呀！（註）坐就坐，</p>
<p>坐在山頭唱條歌</p>
<p>哥唱條來妹唱條</p>
<p>大家唱到桂花開」</p>
<p>（註）即「愛」的意。</p>
<p>「戀妹要戀嫩姑娘，</p>
<p>戀哥要戀少年郎；</p>
<p>阿哥好比搖錢樹，</p>
<p>阿妹好比繡花床」</p>
<p>假設男女互相唱得很投機的時候，那麽就在山上的巖洞或偏僻的地方相歡，或者女的跟着男的到曠野的茅屋或閒屋去相歡，一連住幾日說不定，不過有些也不是出於女子願意，往往被男子所强迫，據說：女子總是「心中有意假低頭」的。</p>
<h3>追悼畫家馬孟容先生</h3>
<p>— 西神</p>
<p>扶風絳帳起塵埃。遺墨驚看猶費猜。剖腹醫難療末疾。焚身天亦忌清才。尊前珠玉空餘子。（入院前十日同飲市麽劇談甚　）眼底雲烟等劫灰。（身後存畫極少）太息壎籚稱二妙。么弘獨唱有餘哀。</p>
<p>孟容先生之喪。適以臥病未及致唁。昨過芝加哥博覽會出品協會。見其遺畫一幀。感愴成吟。　懐令弟公愚。</p>
<h3>皇后</h3>
<p>— 徐本熙</p>
<p>鄉下老伯伯爲了憂時傷亂，便承認眞命天子現在已經出世。他們相信，未來的后直現只三歲，是在替人牧牛。</p>
<p>其實，皇帝遲早要登龍亭的。上海推出了××皇后接着還有中西合辦的皇后選舉事件的産生，我們至少該不否認皇帝要在不久的將來打出世。所以，假使鄉下老伯伯能夠知道皇后已經升登寳座　的話，我想，他們定會虔誠地齋戒沐浴到上海來三跪九叩首以一拜鳳鸞之姿爲快了。</p>
<p>不僅此也，有了皇后，當有未來的皇帝。那時候，政治一统，下詔求賢，國難雖重，怕不會呌矮弟弟活的來死的去嗎？然則皇室之産生，於救國之道，當推獨一了。我們的上海人夠多麽聰明伶俐？</p>
<p>或以爲動盪時代的中國，革命尙且不及，這種勾當，根本暴露了時代的矛盾，那末，這句話顯見是是主觀的。以領袖慾這樣强的民族性，要不出皇帝簡直不可能，乾脆地說：有了皇后，絶對不會「夜半虚前席」。皇帝伯伯誰不想做？</p>
<p>我們做國民在在有殺頭的危險，我們來做做奴隸怎樣？我們要喊「皇上萬歲，娘娘千歲！」</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二回　陋室結芳　暗欽健叟權家擇良伴痛詆貧娃</p>
<p>這一次談話，趙翁給予江氏的印象更是好的了不得。回房之後，就向桂枝說道：這個老頭兒心眼好，怪不得養一個做連長的兒子。桂枝立刻取了衣服到手，趕着做起來，對於他母親說的話，並没有深意。江氏見姑娘那樣趕着縫紉，怎能比伊還懶，也是低着頭，穿針引線，忙個不了。在上午十二點鐘以前；居然就把一件罩袍做好了。桂枝燒着烙鐵，把衣服熨烙得平正了，飯也來不及吃，就把衣服用塊白包袱包好，送到對面甘家去。這甘家的主人翁甘厚之正由内室出來，在院子裏遇到了桂枝，就笑首點頭道：老姑娘又是和我們積之做衣服來着嗎？桂枝道；是你們二爺珍年罩袍。厚之道；他不在家呢，做得了放在你家就得了，回頭呌你們聽差的去拿就是了，還要您跑一趙嗎？桂枝聽說積之不在家，這就無送到内室去之必要，看到旁邊站着小聽差，就交給他，笑道：請你交給二爺，說是這衣服的尺寸。是照上次棉袍子尺寸做的。叵是不合身，就拿去改，最好是二爺穿去讓我看看，我瞧着那裏不合式就改那裏。聽差答應着。將衣服拿進去了。桂枝見不着積之，自然是回家去。厚之望着桂枝的影子去遠了，他不向外走，倒回身向内室裏走。他夫人甘太太正打開箱子，要找兩件好衣服出來，預備明日進城，回娘家去給大哥拜壽。他大哥曾做過一任省長，現在雖然賦閑住在北京城裏，却還有些政治上的潛勢力，就是甘厚之這個西郊河工局長，也是靠了大舅老爺勢力來的。甘太太見丈夫有不好看的臉色走進來，便問道；你跟誰生氣？厚之點了一根烟捲，斜坐在靠背椅上，只是出神，許久許久，才噴出一口烟來道；我笑我們積之，眞是不爭氣，怎麽把對門那個老姑娘看上了，彼此天天來往，不是你來，就是我去。（二○）</p>
<p>救國之聲</p>
<h3>空或大學之建議（上）</h3>
<p>— 張亦曾</p>
<p>讀書是學做人，讀書不一定會做人，然要做一個完全的人，却不可不讀書；讀書要費錢，有錢可以讀書，無錢便不能讀書，這是貴族式的敎育：敎育普及，智識亦普及，我的智識，可以變做人的智識，遂成爲社會上的工具，智識愈普遍，人類的幸福亦愈增進。</p>
<p>空中大學是一普及智識的工具，爲了這件事，曾寫信給哈佛大學校長勞惠爾氏，請他將哈佛課程以無綫電播音，蓋該校課程的完美爲世界學者所公認，而其收費之大，亦爲貧苦學子所望洋興嘆，不但這樣，具有職業而有志研究的人·又苦没有上學的時間。我曾以個人名義請求把哈佛的課程用無綫電空中宣傳，過了一星期，勞校長的回信來了，他客氣說：民衆敎育亦有限制的地方。我們知道哈佛是貴族學校，校長亦貴族化了。我回到祖國後，總想在國内把這件提議見諸實行，空中大學不但可無近來的盛行的學潮，而且經濟一方面，也很低廉，校舍亦不必十分偉大，管理亦可以便利得多，一般品性純潔的學生們，可以不再受任何政黨的影響，中途停綴；曾有再呈請政府當局，詳說利害，要求舉辦，可是在如此政局之下，敎育這件事，何能邀大人先生一顧，不得已我祗能把空中大學的計劃，在此和熱心敎育事業的讀者研究，普盼望批評和贊助以迄於成功。</p>
<p>我嘗觀察現在學生，約可歸納成爲兩種，這兩種是最苦的學生；一種是有錢求學而無好學校可進；一種是有了求學的志願而無錢入學。現在大學收費太貴，普通一個學生在上海一年須四百金左右的用費，家境苦的，他的家庭那能負這樣重担？我常說倘使愛迪生在中國，他亦不能成爲蓋世科學家的。中國報販只能終身賣報，很苦的中國報販，有什麽機會可以自修呢！我前在波士登城參觀一個報販的俱樂部，内中有讀書音樂廣告演說體育等，他們卽使没有發明天才，因求學環境完善，可以造成一個著作家或發明家。我不信我們中國四萬萬人民中，却没有一個像愛先生的人麽？我今年到鄉間住了兩月，知道富於智慧的農民很多，我總想要給他們有發展各人的天才的機會，在理想空中大學當能造就二十世紀的孔夫子孟夫子愛迪生福特及一切的發明家。</p>
<p>空中大學的辦法較普通大學簡單得多，祗要幾個專家的發音片子，及幾個發音電臺，每臺作爲一系，先請專家收音成一種和唱戲片子一樣的音片，再發給各系電臺播音，貧富老少均可讀書，有錢的可以在家内閉戶讀書，無錢買無錢電的學生可到民衆敎育館去聽，一方面再請專家編成書本，使學生便於聽講，學生一面聽一面可以看書，有了疑問可以用通信法去訊問，可者打電話去或親身到民衆敎育館去見助敎，或者附近的大學敎授處詢問解釋，空中大學並設有答復學生疑問助敎，以便利學生質疑問難。目前中國正在千變萬化進步的路途中，應該設一個空中大學像美國哈佛路英國的劍橋牛津，空中大學可分若干系，每系各有獨立的播音電臺，有若干助敎專門答復有疑問的學生，如是辦法，大學敎育可以有普及的希望。</p>

<p>敎育部以年來江西飽受共匪騷提影響敎育當必甚鉅、爲明瞭實際情形起見、特於本年二月間、派督學鍾道　視察該省敎育、並注意於職業敎育之推進、爲時約一月、計視察專科學校三所、中等學校十八所、社會敎育機關七所、小學十八所、敎育局兩所、共計五十餘機關、鍾督學業已公畢返京、並將視察報告、整理完畢、内容共分總綱、專科學校·職業學校·中等師範·小學·社會敎育及江西全省敎育改進之意見七部、頗爲扼要、茲探悉其中重要各點、披露於左、</p>
<p>一·各專科學校敎學設備、除醫專尚可勉强數用外、餘均感缺乏、尤以工塲農塲等爲最感困難、農專之推廣事業、幾未舉辦、</p>
<p>二·各專科學校畢業生、除醫專及工專土木科學生出路不成問題外、餘皆不易安揷、尤以農科爲最、半因實習尙欠充分、半因社會事業很不發達、</p>

<p>六·各職業學校除第二職業學校辦理商科尙無出路問題外、餘多視爲準備升學之途徑、因之普通學科設置過多、而職業學科之時間反不充分、練習亦欠澈底、</p>
<p>七·各職業學校各科所包含之職業科目過多、往往一人須學習四五種性質不同之職業、結果多而不精、影響出路、且各科年限一律、未能依據職業性質、予以伸縮、</p>

<h3>糧食　期粉近疲而遠高</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午各月份呈疲滯之象、以洋麥報價、續小二三角左右、本月份因微有銷塲、始終在一兩七錢六分一關盤旋、遠期因洋麥之小、人心不振、惟交易無多、較前日祗落二厘半、迨至下午開盤、本月份仍趨盤旋、津帮略有回出、聞信大申大等則略有補進、勢呈互擯、遠期以現貨洋麥、因匯率帶緊、日來不見活動、各廠方面、亦未出檔、致人心轉穏、步見回高、不過交易清淡之中、終少生氣可言也、結果本月份較前日小二厘半、四月份漲二厘半、五月份漲七厘半、六七八月份漲五厘云、</p>
<h3>小麥市塲形同停頓</h3>

<h3>人民的天職</h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>人民的天職在於恪守法令，繳納租稅，因之，治理人民支配人民的政府的天職，便在於執行法令和徵收租稅等等了。一個人民的好壞，要看他能否恪守法令，是否繳納租稅：同樣，一個政府的好壞，也只要看牠能否執行法令和徵收捐稅。我敢說我們現在的政府，的確是一個好政府。</p>
<p>政府是由官吏搆成的，好政府底下全是好官吏。所謂好官吏，就是能够奉行好政府所必要做的事，即執行政府的法令以治理人民和徵收捐稅。我相信我們現在所有的官吏，也全是好官吏，他們全能克盡其職，而且也會使人民奉公守法。這裏的奉公就是完捐納稅，而守法當然是遵守法令的簡筆。</p>
<p>人民只要做了人民所應盡之職務已足，别的事用不到揷口的，譬如繳納了捐稅，便已了事，這些錢的用途，是不必去過問的。因爲人民總只是人民，倘使做了人民不應做的事，那便犯了國家的法度，變成不良的奸民了，那是好官吏一定心有所不忍，一定要矯正的，這也是他的執法之一端。</p>
<p>政府的事，自有政府料理，用不到人民參加干預，倘使有了政府，而政府的事還要人民來襄助，那麽要政府來何用。所以像抗日等事，政府總昭示人民以鎭靜和輸將，因爲人民的天職，實在不出乎此二途。鎭靜是恪守法令，輪將是拿出錢來。能拿錢出來，又能守法，人民的天職已盡，再不要别的什麽。</p>
<p>可是近來政府公布了國民參政會組織法及會員選舉法原則，這實在有點不通，倘使國民一字就當作人民解釋。若是在人民以外另有所謂國民的，那麽須得詳加規定，免得和人民混淆，有魚目混珠的危險。因爲人民的天職已如上文所述，决不配來參什麽政的。</p>
<p>倘使參政的國民的確就是人民，那眞有很大的危險了。第一因爲要損及政府的威嚴。人民本來是治於人，只要繳納捐稅已經完事，他們一向只是低頭下心的，倘使一旦抬舉上來與政府分庭抗禮，以後豈不將藐視政府的權威。政治這傢伙，是一種奇怪的東西，你若一染上手，就能使人變了心。因之本是馴良的人民，若一經賦與參政權之後，變成頑民兇民，難以治理起來，豈不討厭。</p>
<p>况且人民並未要求什麽參政權，人民現在只求可以少納一點租稅和少頒些法令。現在把參政的大權給了他們，未免太失策。這一種辦法，大有使人民忘却他們納稅的天職而倖圖過問政府舉措的心思，實在很應注意的。好在現在還不過由中常會通過，還要經立法院的一度檢核，但是事體却是已成騎虎，恐是勢在必行了，那麽只能希望這個參政會是有名無實的，免得釀成擾亂國家法度的危險。</p>
<p>這在草訂法規時很有關係，只要稍微加以用心，就可辦到，我想我們的起草委員全是好官吏，又都聰敏，一定在那些地方早有預備了。</p>
<h3>記約瑟夫</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>轟動上海的意人尤維吾控薛錦園女士誘姦其子約瑟夫案，使我有深深的感觸。約瑟夫·七八年前，曾從我讀書四個月，人很聰明，體格又好，可惜他的環境不好。他的父親意大利人，喜怒十分極端：要呌約瑟夫受西方的敎育，但進了西人學堂，不久就出來了。他的母親蘇州人，性子太馴順，她要呌約瑟夫受東方的敎育，希望我敎些人之初之類；但四個月以後，也不見進正式的小學。這十年來，約瑟夫西又不西，東又不東，結果等於没有受敎育。我曾經和友人說：小孩子在上海不受敎育是不行的，你不敎育他，有一個大學校丨丨上海的社會丨丨會敎育他：等到你發見樹身子已經彎曲了，那代已經没有法子了。果然，薛錦園女士就來做約瑟夫的敎授，即不說誘姦，平日耳提面命，琢磨的工夫，也就成績很好。一個十六七歲的小孩子，讓他在交際花的手掌上打觔斗，這是多麽可怕的事丨</p>
<p>上海的家庭敎育，畸形發展得可怪。有些把兒女看作芝蘭玉樹，定要種在階前，每家請一個家庭敎師，受那最舊式的敎育。這種和社會隔離的兒童敎育，兒童永遠不能參與社羣生活：正如關在房間裏的花草，從不見過太陽；一陣狂風暴雨就打得七零八落，芝蘭玉樹的下塲，常是如此。有些把兒女當作野馬，任他在社會上亂跑。初則衖堂敎育，繼則街頭敎育，終則游戲塲跳舞塲敎育，揩油·胡調，游蕩……整整的一套畢三敎科書，造成一大羣小畢三同志。兒童如田堘邊的小草，聽憑牛羊踐蹈，不留一點生機。這樣上一代人戕害下一代人，因果循環，不可究極！薛錦園女士敎會了約瑟夫，約瑟夫又去敎會了許多蜜司，天天替報紙擴充社會新聞的地位；惡化的梅毒，傳染到上海全社會，能不使人寒心嗎！</p>
<p>請上海各界人士莫把這件事當作等閒的笑話看，這是當前一個重大的兒童敎育問題！蘇俄的生路影片，他開塲即說：「一個没有受敎育的孩子，即是新社會建設的破壞者。」上海早已布滿了流氓·畢三，乞丐以及形形色色的流浪人，現在還讓他們不斷敎導訓練候補的隊伍，將如何免於總崩潰的命運呢！</p>
<h3>阿Q永遠健在</h3>
<p>— 奇玉</p>
<p>這是一個小小的抗議：誰說阿Q巳經死了呢？他的的確確還活在人間，而且鴻運當道。</p>
<p>懷疑這話的人，一定要吃驚地問：「證據呢？」</p>
<p>哪，你看丨</p>
<p>×月×日××報不是載着某公談話，謂「暴日砲火不足畏，十年内，日必有大革命」嗎？</p>
<p>說這話的，與没法向仇人報復，希望仇人得病的人有什麽兩樣呢？</p>
<p>三歲的孩童也都知道這是一種可憐的卑怯的没氣力的話，然而却偏偏出之於堂堂要人之口。我眞有些替他着急，爲什麽他擺着現成話不說？他要是說：「日本近遭大地震，不久即將撤兵，交回失地，不成問題，」不更可以使愚蠢的老百姓相信些，安心些嗎？</p>
<p>記得阿Q每當被人打了之後，嘴裏都要嘟嚷一句「老子才被兒子打呢？」來自解，來謀精神上的勝利。當時年輕，看了只覺好笑，現在才知道，原來阿Q精神，是我們的國有哲學。</p>
<p>誰說阿Q已經死了呢？阿Q是永遠健在！</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張貫平</p>
<p>「那個廖牧師逼着他去的！老廖要他去向老嗆說，從明年一月起，增加他的薪水。」</p>
<p>「廖牧師每月多少的薪水？」</p>
<p>「五十塊。他要求增加至八十塊。但是老哈不答應。以後又减至七十塊，還是不答應。老廖又减　六十塊。……………………」</p>
<p>「那末，老哈太刻薄了。」</p>
<p>「還不是！老廖在敎會裏，做了十二三年的工作了。只要他加十塊錢，老哈還是不眯呢。」　　曹夫人每說「還不是」，便要稍微歪一歪頭，而雙唇又張動得非常的急激，這更减低了她的美觀和女性的第一條件，柔淑。</p>
<p>「那老廖怎麽樣呢？」</p>
<p>「像老哈那樣寡情，老廖的面子實在下不去了。所以轉託了世光，要他當作自動地勸告，要求老哈，從明年一月起，加他五塊大洋的薪水。世光在前天，昨天，都到敎會裏去了，但没有遇着那個番鬼頭，只是空花了車錢。林先生，耶穌聖誕快到了，他們忙呀，所以世光今早一早又到敎會去，趕他在未出門以前會他。爲老鏖的五塊錢事，跑了不少的寃枉路了。」　　「宗敎家眞刻薄呀！」</p>
<p>「不止刻薄，完全是殘酷！跟宗敎家吃飯，一輩子没出息的。我還不是常常悔恨。不是我說曹先生的壞話，我眞是嫁錯了人！我從前竟不知道他是那樣不長進的！」</p>
<p>她說了後，又望着海泉作了一個媚笑。海泉又想，這才不敢當啊。</p>
<p>二十八</p>
<p>在曹世光家裏痴坐了一會，才想起自己袋裏的橡皮糖了，他忙取了出來。</p>
<p>「這是在途中買的無聊的東西，不過還特緻。………………」</p>
<p>「什麽東西？」</p>
<p>曹夫人半點也不客氣，把那幾包橡皮糖接過去了。</p>
<p>「……啊，我當是什麽東西。林先生，Chewing　Gum嗎？我在女學校的時候，頂喜歡吃的！」</p>
<p>「曹太太，你也知道Chewing　Gum？」</p>
<p>海泉有點驚奇起來了，何以她竟有這樣的時髦，吃過Chewing　Gum，並且她還說住過女學校呢，不知是那一家的女學。</p>
<h3>讀書隨筆</h3>
<p>— 王和</p>
<p>近來因爲倭奴欺侮我中華民族太甚，憤慨之餘，頗希望有些能發揚民族意識的文學作品出現，最低限度，也應該有些「民族文選」之類出版，庶幾「文字有靈，國魂可喚。」前幾天看報紙廣告，居然有「江蘇省立鎭江中學國文學科編」的「民族文選」出版，歡喜之餘，便到四馬路某書局買得一冊。歸來，在岳武穆的畫像前焚起一爐好香，細細拜讀。第一篇讀史可法傳（選自明史），中間有這樣的一段：</p>
<p>士英（按即馬士英）即以是日入直·議分江北爲四鎭：東平伯劉澤清轄淮海淮北，經理山東一路總兵官：高傑轄徐泗，駐泗水，經理開歸一路總兵官；劉良佐轄鳳壽，駐臨淮，經理陳杞一路。靖南伯黃得功轄滁和，駐廬州，經理光固一路。這段文字使我糢糊了：劉澤清和高傑都經理一路總兵官，劉良佐和黃得功却只有經理某某一路，底下没有「總兵官，」難道這總兵官爲抵抗滿洲僞國在山海關外陣亡了嗎？因此我記得從前有一位塾師，爲讀大學</p>
<p>知止而后有定定·而后能靜靜，而</p>
<p>后能安安·而后能慮慮，而後能得末句底下少一「得」字，大惑不角。後來跑到另一個私塾裏，見那塾師正爲大學　裏多一「得」字，没處安放（因爲他的句讀爲：知止而后有，定定而后能，靜靜而后能，安安而后能，慮慮而后能，得……，）他欣然說：「踏破鐵鞋無覓處，得來全不費功夫！我缺少的一個得字，原來在此！」只可惜「民族文選裏」的兩個「總兵官」，一時却無處去找。再讀下去，</p>
<p>可法無子。遺命史德威爲之後。有弟可程，崇禎十六年進士，擢庶吉士；京師陷，降賊：賊敗，南歸。可法請置之，理王（按原文於理王兩字旁加人名線）以可法故，令養母。可程遂居南京。後流寓宜興，閱四十年而卒。</p>
<p>原來做「民族英雄」的史可法，他不能大義滅親，請求福王把他的不肖弟置之於法（理，法也，置之於法，即置之理也，）反要求福王對於他弟弟的叛國降賊，置之不理。像這樣枉法徇私的人，明史居然替他列傳，像煞有介事的做了明朝的忠臣，做了中國的民族英雄，眞是寃哉枉也！（恕我引用「像煞有介事」的成語，實在不是有心唐突史可法先生，我因爲史可法先生早已死了，他不會爲我說他「像煞有介事」，來函要求道歉，或甚至於出錢登廣告也。同樣的，史可法先生不會請律師對「民族文選」的編者向法院起訴。）又，我向讀明史及其他明季野史之類，不曾見有「理王」其人，記之，以待詳考。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>我們所信的是什麽？</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>「國於天地，必有與立，」一國的精神，雖與他國不必盡同，但至少在本國是須一致的，像日本的「大和魂」，英國的「牛約翰」，日耳曼的民族精神，蘇聨的社會主義思想，不問其所採是正確或是盲目的，都能左右一國的行動，而可在國際舞臺上一角短長，但我們有什麽中心的思想來作我們民衆鬥爭的領導呢。？</p>
<p>可固答一句：「我們所信的是天」。丨丨「靠天吃飯」，是中國人唯一的哲學。這便證表現在日常生活中，不必從故紙堆裏去找。</p>
<p>但彼此都民「靠天吃飯」，原無所用其要緊，不幸而有一部份人却不願「靠天」·而想進一步的來「替天行道」於是另一部份人雖欲「靠天」而有無從「吃飯」之槪，這眞不是偶然。</p>
<p>現在國難情勢的嚴重，是誰也無從否認的，但我們要在這嚴重中找到出路，所憑藉的决不是「天」。然而「靠天吃飯」的思想正彌漫於社會。我雖不是悲觀論者，但事實告訴我却不容樂觀。現時整個的中國是墮入了徬徨昏迷的狀態丨丨一部份的清醒是少數中的少數丨丨大部份勞苦羣衆尙未達到完全認識自已的時候，而一部份小資産者又很巧妙地逃避了現實，逃避了它對於歷史上所應負的任務，躱進「象牙之塔」裏去了所以從現時講，我們没有一個中心的思想，可以作我們國民行事的標準。我們已没有了依傍，没有了信仰，只「飄飄」然的生活着，所有的只是無聊的希望，丨丨如希望敵人遭震災，希望敵人十年之内發生革命之類，丨丨與頽廢的思想，丨丨如跳舞救國，玉容救國等等，種種「靠天」哲學的運用，丨丨這實是没出息的人類受到刺激後所發生的必然的反應。</p>
<p>但我們就終於這樣的徬徨着嗎？不，睡着的固然多，醒的還有，正需待一種努力。</p>
<p>是拿破崙曾這樣地說過吧，「東方有一巨人，讓他睡着吧，他要醒來時，就得震撼全世界」誠然，我們有四萬萬的人口，潛力是無可意想的，但有誰能用一種思想把我們散沙似的人心貫穿起來，那就值得偉大。懶洋洋地生存，不如痛快地死去，無目的的苟活，不如有目的的犧牲，起來吧，</p>
<p>最後歸結兩句話，中國的存亡，看許多人心是否能有貫穿起來的一日，世界的震撼，看貫穿中國人心的是那一種思想。</p>
<h3>我的夢</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>依據科學的解釋來說，晚上做夢是日間思想的巡迴，至少是曾受到動境的刺激所致，所以夢，原是是怎様不可捉摸幻境，而是一種物觀的反應，但自來有所謂「黄粱一夢」，「南柯一夢」，詞氣間却全然是虚無飄渺了·即如是也。我亦滿心希望我的夢，有若干分實現的可能性。</p>
<p>先說私己生活的夢吧：自然生存在現時代線内的個人，是與社會緊相聨繫的，換句話說，便是個人生活，無往而不受時代的支配，有如個人是莽莽原野中的草叢，而時代是四向的風暴，你看草叢的動向，是不是要受風暴的支配·然而我總得把握住，做個現時代裏的人，不管是用腦或用力，總得咬牢牙根從勞動中去尋求生活　坐飤了人，不但爲時代所不許，將頻没落，並且也未免太斵喪了人類天賦的本能。牛馬可供勞力，就是鷄狗雖只能食人食，但也有他的對社會的供獻。</p>
<p>更是我没有祖産的餘蔭，也没有權貴的親緣，而又是如此笨拙的生性，不會諂媚，也不會承奉，不慣吹牛，也不慣拍馬，歸根一句我是最痛恨生活圈子裏有什麽鑽營。那麽，要想生活，不挨凍餓，便須有自己撾得住的辦法，我只希望從今以後，增强我的吃苦頭的程度，這才是私己生活或可解决的先决保障。</p>
<p>其次說到社會，那眞廣泛極了，只得擷精抉華，略道一二：</p>
<p>我也並不夢想什麽天下昇平，没有戰爭的大同世界，只希望今後世間的戰爭，甚至政治的運行，經濟的操縱，漸漸走向意義比較廣博的路上去·</p>
<p>我也並不夢想統治階級完全不剝削，不要錢，做老百姓的完全不盡義務，不納稅·我只希望在廢除苛捐雜稅的美名下，不要中騐了這麽一首名對：「自古未聞糞有稅，於今只許屁無捐。」</p>
<p>我也並不夢想吾國的高等敎育辦得像英美的那麽有成效，義務敎育辦得像丹麥的那麽普及·只希望凡戴了方帽子的大學生，都能寫得一通文理清順的家信，全國不識字的民衆，不致日益增多到百分之百。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想我國還是世界上的頭等農業國，只希望今後糧食一項，不要再源源的從外洋輸入。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想吾國的工業發達到像德國的那麽新奇，普遍，只希望吾現在握着書寫的鋼筆頭能夠製造一些出來·不要吾再用這氣人的洋貨了。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想商人奮起抵制仇貨，只希不要暗中把一些國貨換了牌子做仇貨賣，抗日緊張的時候，又把仇貨換上國貨的牌號賣。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想凡執醫業的都能診好凡百的病，只希望不要任意施診，殺人。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想我們四萬萬同胞都去抗日，只希望媚日的漢奸不要層出不窮，遺笑外人，倀害同胞，也就得了。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想銅板賤了電車不加價，只希望銅板貴了的時候，也有减價一日的到臨。</p>
<p>最後我也並不夢想我這許多的夢都能見諸事實，只希望它有若干分實現的可能性。</p>

<h3>猜不透她們的心理</h3>
<p>— 希頴</p>
<p>每天早上，風雨無阻，在電車上，總得賞光着幾位女職員的豐采。她們負有提高女權和實行男女平等的重任，所以寗願抛棄了閨閣，到那人烟稠密的市場中度着女職員的生活。她們不爲了區區的月薪，也不屑被人們稱着活招牌，花瓶等新名詞，唯一目的，是替女界開，一條新生路，給男性們一記當頭棒。因此她們時常孤高自傲，把世上的男子都不放在眼裏；她們的意思像是：即使我們嫁不着你們這班臭男子，我們也不愁餓煞。自己有能力可以自活，倒是你們討不着我們作妻子，也得急一個半死呢！　不過，侚在天換一套衣服和臉上總是塗得紅一塊白一方的時候，那就不得不替她們着想，是否專誠向男性示威的呢？抑是表示着做得女職員，就非如此不可？那時，恐怕她們的心裏都希望着像××公司裏所謂×××女郎一樣的蒙着富家翁的光顧做一重個裘披珠的太太呢！倒底她們的心裏是怎樣，也非我們所她能猜透的了。</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（十續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>說到曹操曹操就到來乾正是林大平。</p>
<p>年輕的人撞在一起，正像開水和牛奶一般的易於融合；何况，今天他們又有名正言順的生意經在談論着，說話不覺更有勁起來。其中發言最多的便是林大平他把開辦唱片公司的整個計劃，像說書一般的講解着，每一句都是異樣的動聽。</p>
<p>「待我明天馬上擬一份合同，我們便可以正式進行了！」空談的結果，便由飽灌着法律常識的王大律師，决定了一個具體的方針。</p>
<p>伍逸原是一個心最直，口最快的脚色，當夜在編輯室裏，便一字不留的把這件事說結了趙千里聽；恰巧趙千里近來很不得意，也想找些事情消遣消遣，就自動向伍逸請求，願意加入他們的合夥公司。</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>「大王唱片公司」成立之後，伍逸竟像換了一個人一般；閒的時候，儘在那裏盤桓着，不但經濟方面，再不像以前那般的天天仿佛過大除夕一樣的拮据了，就是精神方面，他也覺得十二分的舒適，愉快，滿足。</p>
<p>「我有三個最好的朋友，他們都是一般的熱烈而忠實！」有一次，他很得意地向人家說道：「現在，我方始嘗到了交朋友的眞樂趣！」</p>
<p>（七）女戲子</p>
<p>有一個初冬的早蜄和約摸打過了十點鐘，伍逸很安靜地躺在大王唱片公司經理室裏的一張絲絨沙發上，翻看着當天的報紙；因爲時間過早，不但王玉麟和趙千里都没有光降，就是職司經理的林大平，也還不曾駕到咧。</p>
<p>「對不起！林先生在家嗎？」伍逸正在像研究古文一般的拜讀一篇甲軍閥起兵討伐乙軍閥的通電的當兒，突然，嵌着不透明的玻璃的小門，輕輕地開了一半，在一陣濃烈的香水精的氣味裏，走進了一位玉立亭亭，眉目如畫的美人兒。立刻，屋子裏像添了一盞五百支光的電燈一樣地大放光明，幾乎眩耀得使伍逸睜不開眼睛來。</p>
<p>先前的幾年裏，伍逸已在脂粉叢中衝突過千回合以上，女人的影子，差不多已嵌滿了他的腦神筋；可是目前這一位，却眞有他生平所從未見過的美妙的儀態。尤其是微笑時候，頰上所透着的兩個像粉揑就，玉琢就的酒　兒，險些使他懷疑自己是在夢夢了！</p>
<p>「還不间到，也許過一會就來咧」，五逸站起身來，彬彬有禮的對答着。</p>
<p>「那末，………我能不能在這裏候一會嗎」？這位姑娘不但美麗，而且是大方得可愛：她微微把腿部向前屈了一屈，行了一個西方十七世紀時代的貴族女子所常用的初見禮，很活潑地卸下了身上罩着的一件皮領的斗蓬，露出一身純黑色的衣裙來。</p>

        <h1>1933.03.23</h1>
<h3>No Fierce Battles on the Entire Border Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops at Luowenyu Retreat and Gather at Bao Ye Miao Gou</p>
<p>Enemy Attacks at Dongjiakou Repelled</p>
<p>War News Silent at Lengkou and Yiyuan Kou</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan Inspects the Front Lines, Preparing for a Counterattack</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed from Beiping on the 22nd, stating that the enemy had no movements on the entire front line today, only sending aircraft to bomb and harass from time to time. The Japanese soldiers, after being repeatedly struck hard by our forces, appeared quite fearful. According to civilians who fled back from the enemy side, our troops were not afraid of guns and cannons, and the enemy soldiers were useless, etc. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Over a thousand enemy troops, consisting of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, launched a counterattack at 8:00 AM this morning at Dongjiakou, but failed three times. More than twenty Japanese planes flew to Zunhua's Santunying this afternoon to bomb. The enemy besieged Xinglong County, and Japanese planes flew to reconnoiter for days. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy troops at Luowenyu are now at Bao Ye Miao Gou, twenty li away. There were only skirmishes yesterday and today. Japanese planes flew to reconnoiter near Zunhua this morning. Important officers among the enemy corpses abandoned at the Luowenyu positions have all been transported away by planes. The bodies of the remaining seven or eight hundred soldiers were photographed by our side and then buried. The enemy troops arriving from behind the enemy lines have shown signs of moving towards Malan Pass, Huangyaguan, and Jiangjunguan on our left flank. Several aircraft flew to the Eastern Tombs area yesterday for reconnaissance. It is expected that the enemy will attack again, and we are on high alert. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Communication from the Xifengkou area has been disrupted. No war news has been received in Beiping this afternoon. There has also been no news from Lengkou yesterday and today. There was fierce fighting on the 20th at Ban Chang Yu, Chengzi Yu, Huachang Yu, and other places between Yiyuan Kou and Jie Di Kou. The situation afterward is unclear. Although the rumors of a full-scale Japanese offensive and threats to Beiping and Tianjin are intended to intimidate, our side is determined to make comprehensive plans to prepare for the enemy. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, along with Kong Xiangxi, Yu Fei, and Xiao Zhenying, went to the front lines today to慰劳 the soldiers and inspect the positions. Kong, Yu, Xiao, and others will return to Beiping the day after tomorrow. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because of hearing about more than a hundred cavalry from Ma Quan Zi camping at Da Zhang Zi outside Lengkou on the evening of the 19th, all the people fled. The cavalry had already arrived at Da Zhang Zi on the 20th, then advanced to Tushi Men, and forced the villagers to remove road obstacles. After our army stopped the enemy from advancing, the enemy retreated back to Da Zhang Zi. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan went to the front lines to inspect and will soon command the troops to counterattack. Kong Xiangxi accompanied him to inspect and慰劳 the officers and soldiers on his behalf. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When the enemy at Xifengkou retreated, they were ambushed by the people. The anti-Japanese efforts in various villages and townships in the Hebei border area along the outside of the Great Wall are particularly intense. When the enemy at Lengkou retreated, our Dushan People's Regiment and the Anti-Japanese Iron and Blood Regiment threatened their rear, first destroying the roads. More than thirty Japanese armored vehicles and automobiles were blocked, and two enemy planes were shot down. Therefore, the Japanese and puppet troops are particularly vigilant in their actions outside the pass. They have a deep hatred for the people of Dushan and have arbitrarily killed many of them. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Xifengkou stated that the enemy at Tiemen Pass was defeated by our Li [name illegible] regiment. On the evening of the 21st, [name illegible] battalion was sent to attack the enemy outside Dongjiakou, burning more than thirty enemy supply vehicles and killing over a hundred enemy soldiers. Our company commander Li Boji was killed in action, and over sixty soldiers were wounded or killed. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Uniform Epaulettes Used as War Spoils</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Ruming sent troops to search the enemy corpses at Luowenyu and found more than twenty enemy officers' corpses. The officers' uniform epaulettes, etc., worn by the enemy have been taken back to the camp as war spoils. The main force of the enemy near Bao Ye Miao is awaiting reinforcements and has no ability to counterattack at the moment. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Enemy's Rear</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The staff office of Song's [number illegible] division telegraphed from Beiping on the 21st, stating that the report from the scouts sent to the enemy's rear was as follows: 1. The enemy facing Luowenyu Shanzhayu retreated to the Yumei Ridge area, more than twenty li from Luowenyu, after being severely attacked by our forces and are working hard to construct fortifications. Their main force is near Bao Ye Miao Gou. 2. The enemy forced the people in Gushanzi to inquire about our military situation. Several people were shot to death because they did not want to be used by the enemy, which was extremely tragic. 3. The enemy grabbed local residents in the Foyemiao area to serve as vanguards. Those who did not comply were shot to death. The residents were very frightened and fled. 4. Civilian livestock in the Banbishan area were all slaughtered and eaten. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soldiers in Trenches Feel Increasingly Distressed After Snow</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The head of Song's army office in Beiping said that after the enemy retreated to Yumei Ridge and other places, they seemed to be waiting for reinforcements. There were no fierce battles on the front lines yesterday. After our army captured the enemy's artillery positions after the 11th, our army took the initiative. Now the enemy does not dare to attack us lightly. Military strategists most fear arrogance after victory. Our troops are still enduring hardship on the front lines, strictly guarding their positions, and preventing the enemy from attacking. However, after the heavy snow last night, the soldiers in the trenches lack clothing to shield them from the snow and rain, which is very distressing. Moreover, due to financial difficulties, there is no ability to replenish them. For all慰劳 efforts, it is best to donate these practical items. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Jinzhou Collects Cart Pullers</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army in Jinzhou recently collected 3,000 large carts to send to Jinzhou to await orders and forced merchants and civilians to drive the carts. The Chinese who were forced to drive were put in iron shackles to prevent them from escaping. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song's Wounded Soldiers Transported to Beiping for Treatment</h3>
<p>(Beiping) One hundred wounded soldiers from Song's troops were transported to Beiping last night and sent to various hospitals for treatment. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Ruiheng has been planning and organizing the rescue of wounded soldiers on the front lines in Beiping for days. He is going to Tianjin today due to business and will return to Beiping within days. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Many places in Shunde and Baoding have been found to establish temporary wounded soldier relief hospitals, preparing to accommodate and treat wounded soldiers from the front lines as much as possible. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The National Wounded Soldier Hospital organized by Jiang Menglin and his wife will open tomorrow. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rehe People Yearn for National Army to Exit the Pass</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese and puppet troops entered Rehe, they whipped, lashed, killed, and slaughtered everywhere. The people deeply regret it and hope that our army will exit the pass to kill the enemy and recover the lost territory. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Gubeikou Area</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Burns and Kills Villagers in Extremely Brutal Manner</h3>
<p>Hiring Foolish People as Spies, Killing Them Afterward to Silence Them</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Fly Over Nantianmen, Shixia Town, and Other Places for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>(Beiping) Someone from Gubeikou said that the Japanese army has been burning and killing villagers in the Gubeikou area in an extremely brutal manner for days. Upon encountering a Chinese person, they ask, "What country are you from?" and "Are you obedient?" If the answer is "Chinese" or "disobedient," they are stabbed and killed, with many casualties. The Japanese army recently hired Chinese people as spies, paying them $1.40 per day, and sent them to the Shixia Town area to scout our news, but after they return and report, they are shot to death to silence them.</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telephone call from Shixia Town reported that Japanese planes flew over Nantianmen, Shixia Town, and other places yesterday for reconnaissance. They were fired upon by our army with anti-aircraft machine guns and did not dare to linger, quickly fleeing. According to intelligence reports, the Japanese army in the Gubeikou area has slightly increased. The enemy troops in Chengde are very empty because they have gone to support Xifengkou and other places. Recently, they have been transporting many items left by our side in Chengde. The enemy troops are causing unbearable harassment to our residents in Chengde. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jielingkou</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Our Positions</h3>
<p>People in the Qingshankou Area Flee</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy facing Jielingkou, a joint force of about four to five hundred men, launched two fierce attacks on us at dawn on the 20th, but were repelled by our Qiu Regiment's fierce resistance. At 9:00 AM, five enemy planes in formation bombed our positions, dropping over forty bombs in the Shibeigou and Zhuyue Shankou areas, destroying over a dozen civilian houses, killing over twenty soldiers, and injuring over ten. Morale is extremely high. The people in the Qingshankou area have all fled. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy has repeatedly attacked our Jielingkou without success. Several hundred of their wounded soldiers have been transported to Caiyu and Shuangshanzi, about fifty to sixty li from Jielingkou. There are garrisoned miscellaneous soldiers stationed there, causing unbearable harassment and abuse. The people are extremely eager for our army to exit the pass. Now the enemy is again gathering civilians in the area to build an airfield in the Caiyu area. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sun Dianying's Troops</p>
<h3>Selecting a Valiant Death Squad to Attack the Enemy</h3>
<p>One Battalion Commander and Two Platoon Leaders Killed in Action</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying telegraphed from Beiping, stating that last night, our troops selected a valiant death squad of 400 men, led by [name illegible] battalion commander [name illegible] of the [name illegible] regiment, departing at midnight. At Yinshi (3-5 AM), they bypassed Liangdi and Sandai Goumen, ambushing the enemy at Heishan Zui. At the same time, our Liangdi [name illegible] regiment also launched an attack. Our Dadao (broadsword) team recklessly charged forward, fiercely striking, killing over a hundred enemies. The enemy retreated towards Longhua, and we captured six light machine guns, one hundred and sixty small arms, and over three hundred boxes of 6.5mm ammunition. In this battle, Battalion Commander [surname] was killed in action, as well as two platoon leaders, six soldiers, and one company commander and eighteen soldiers were wounded. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's troops have been fighting the Japanese army's Mogi Cavalry Brigade in northern Rehe for two weeks, with heavy losses on both sides. Because Sun's forces had too many wounded soldiers on the front lines, he sent 637 lightly wounded soldiers from Guojiatun to Beiping for treatment, which should arrive today and tomorrow. The remaining hundred or so seriously wounded are currently receiving treatment on the front lines. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping Military Branch</p>
<h3>Unifying Intelligence Matters</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In order to unify intelligence, the military branch decided that the foreign affairs section would be responsible for handling internal and external intelligence matters, and a deputy section chief would be added. Chen Chuxiong has been appointed. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Left Nanjing for Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei, Chen Bijun, and Zeng Zhongming left Nanjing for Shanghai on the evening of the 22nd. Before leaving, the Railway Bureau prepared a flower car and attached it to the 11 o'clock night express train.

He hoped that the people of the country should remain calm in this critical situation. He recently visited Minister He and did not hear about this matter either, which proves that the rumors are inaccurate. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>No Reports Received in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Fengjiu, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Government Office in Beijing, said that he recently received a telegram from Chairman Jin, who did not mention the conflict between the Hui and Han people in Xinjiang Province. If there was a major incident as reported in foreign telegrams, they would definitely not maintain strict secrecy. However, it is inevitable that there may be minor disputes between tribes in Xinjiang Province, where the Han and Hui people live together. Recently, various parties have reported news about the situation in Xinjiang Province that does not match the facts. This is due to the blocked transportation and isolation of news. Therefore, Chairman Jin is now preparing to build a highway from Suiyuan to Dihua, hoping to communicate with the central government and various provinces to avoid isolation.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Murkiness of the European Four-Power Agreement</h3>
<h3>(1) Mussolini's Proposal</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald, accompanied by British Foreign Secretary Simon, flew to Italy on the 18th of this month to discuss with the Blackshirt Prime Minister how to save Europe from its current crisis. Mussolini proposed an agreement between the four major European powers – Britain, France, Italy, and Germany – with the intention of enhancing the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and encouraging peace in Europe and the world. The full text of the agreement has not yet been fully published, but the general idea is nothing more than maintaining peace in Europe, amending the Locarno Treaty and the Treaty of Versailles, and recognizing Germany's equality in armaments... By doing this, it is possible to alleviate the conflict between Germany and France, ease the opposition between France and Italy, and seek to break the difficult situation of economic suffocation in European countries today and to rescue the current political crisis.</p>
<p>In the Lausanne Conference in mid-June of last year, after reducing Germany's reparations to 3 billion marks, capitalist countries around the world considered this a chance for renewal. Britain and France showed their magnanimity, and Germany also showed its great achievements. From then on, the "cancer" of reparations was cut open, and the restoration of prosperity depended on the gradual improvement of the economy. Although international disputes have not been completely eliminated, there should be no doubt that the Lausanne Agreement is a good cause. In addition, stimulated by the election campaign in the United States of North America, general industry and commerce suddenly became active, which will undoubtedly help the world economy recover and prevent the deterioration of international relations. Unexpectedly, as time passed, the reparations issue came to an end, but the Treaty of Versailles still existed. France was unwilling to easily let go of "security guarantees," and international tariff barriers continued to be built. In this situation, with a self-sufficient closed-door policy, trying to prevent the entry of foreign manufactured goods and hoping to consolidate the domestic market and develop the economy, is it possible to achieve this? As shown by the facts, domestic markets in various countries are declining day by day. High tariffs are not only insufficient to prosper the domestic market, but also affect overseas sales. (Because the opponent countries also impose retaliatory tariffs, causing exports to shrink.) Strong naval power cannot clear the inventory, forcing people to buy. As a result, economic panic is intensified, and political changes are greater, which is inevitable. In addition, Japanese militarists are advancing blindly, indulging in the temporary greed of expanding their territory, and not hesitating to plant the seeds of long-term disaster. Under the pretext of special interests, they created the puppet state of Manchuria. China has suffered the most, and the world's economic balance has also been greatly affected. The market is shrinking more and more, the political crisis is getting deeper and deeper, and the arms race is becoming more intense.</p>
<h3>(2) Military Contradictions Unfold, Political Relations Deteriorate</h3>
<p>"Peace" and "security" are what everyone needs and what countries advocate. Even the most reactionary elements would not advocate dissent. However, the reality is often the opposite of the ideal, and human history often goes back and forth in the waves of chaos and turmoil without a day of peace. Taking the First World War as an example, the major countries on the European continent were taught a lesson that cannot be said to be insignificant, and they suffered a disaster that cannot be said to be shallow. Politicians in Western European countries have also worked hard for peace in the past decade, but the result has been the opposite, and the international situation is getting worse. The superficial balance will also be difficult to maintain, and closed-door policies are prevailing everywhere. Nationalism is rampant for a time, and the demon of war is growing in it. The world's crisis cannot be liquidated by peaceful means, and it is also lamentable that war is desired to reach a conclusion.</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power, it has been less than two months. The "Swastika flag" pointed to the direction, on the one hand, trampled on the Weimar Constitution, and on the other hand, gathered its shock troops to break into the neutral zone between Germany and France. Not only did it want to break the Treaty of Versailles, but it also had the meaning of provoking France. Although France protested, the reply from the German Foreign Minister Neurath was to blame it on Germany's internal problems. Although this may not become a trigger, the ill will between France and Germany will be even worse. The Free City of Danzig is located between Germany and Poland, and relations between the two countries have always been unsatisfactory. Recently, alarm bells have been ringing frequently, and the situation is indeed very tense. Moreover, there is a conspiracy to separate Ukraine from the Soviet Union. In addition to the dangerous relationship between Germany and Poland, there is also the discord between Germany and the Soviet Union. It is expected that relations with the Soviet Union will deteriorate when the National Socialist Party is in power. And the combination of Hitler and Mussolini to form a second triple alliance to confront France and the Soviet Union is still a reversion to the eve of the World War. Such ominous omens cannot but make people feel uneasy.</p>
<p>What is even worse is that six British people were arrested in Moscow, which has a significant impact on British-Soviet relations. The Soviet Union's authorities have always been quick in diplomacy. Why don't they give careful consideration to this incident? Moreover, one shot from Sarajevo triggered an unprecedented tragedy in Europe. Now the disarmament conference is in turmoil. British Prime Minister MacDonald rushed to Italy and did not pay attention to the dangerous political situation in Central Europe. As a result of the talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, there was a suggestion of a four-power agreement to seek a balance of armaments. How can France not consider the shaking of its hegemony and say that the interests of small countries are damaged? However, European countries, from France to Italy to Germany, all keenly feel the economic fatigue and the expansion of the contradiction between unemployment and the accumulation of inventory. At this time, how can they recklessly engage in war? Therefore, the proposal after the meeting between the British and Italian prime ministers may be able to seek a period of rest and win short-term peace from the extreme difficulties.</p>
<p>Mussolini's New Plan</p>
<h3>France Advocates Based on the Spirit of the League of Nations</h3>
<h3>Sincere Cooperation Among the Four Major European Powers</h3>
<p>German Fascist Enthusiasm</p>
<p>France's Opposition to Revising the Treaty Becomes Stronger</p>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, the British Embassy issued a statement mentioning the talks between the British and French prime ministers and foreign ministers, saying that the French authorities want to establish sincere cooperation among the four major European powers for the sake of peace based on the framework and spirit of the League of Nations. These four countries are permanent members of the League of Nations. French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet thanked the British authorities for providing information, which allowed them to conduct a closer study of the British and Italian proposals, and promised to exchange views with each other as soon as possible. (Reuter dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) French politicians continued to study Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's proposal for a European peace pact today, but it was heard that French Prime Minister Daladier opposed revising the Treaty of Versailles or other treaties to form this pact. It is said that Daladier and MacDonald both believe that if Mussolini's new plan is feasible, its provisions should conform to the spirit and structure of the League of Nations Covenant, and MacDonald also insisted that it is not appropriate to abandon the League of Nations at this time. As for the rumors that France has accepted Mussolini's proposal in principle, it has been denied by the authorities here, saying that they are currently studying the Italian Prime Minister's plan. Daladier must go to Rome to discuss with the Italian Prime Minister in person before a decision can be made. According to diplomatic sources, according to the current four-power pact plan, the treaty may need to be revised, but given the current political situation in Germany, the French authorities will oppose revising the treaty.

<h3>British-French Talks Extremely Cordial</h3>
<p>(Paris) British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, and French Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, and others met at the British Embassy. The meeting began at 11:30 a.m. and was temporarily suspended at 1:10 p.m. British cabinet members reported the British-Italian talks in Rome to the French authorities. The discussions were extremely cordial. At 3 p.m., the British and French dignitaries began to study the content of the British-Italian plan until it was completed at 5:45 p.m. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the meeting, British Prime Minister MacDonald told guests that the United Kingdom is not bound by any predetermined disarmament plan, nor is it bound by a plan to revise the treaty as a result of the meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. When asked whether any plan to maintain peace in Europe had been drafted in Rome, the British Prime Minister replied that many proposals had indeed been discussed, but the Roman plan published in the newspapers was not based on solid facts. There were many rumors, and he was tired of dispelling them. The cooperation among Britain, France, Germany, and Italy mentioned in the Roman Communiqué absolutely does not mean replacing the League of Nations. (Reuter dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>The Door to European Peace Opens</h3>
<p>MacDonald Leaves Paris Yesterday to Return Home</p>
<p>The French Prime Minister Will Make a Trip to London</p>
<p>(London) The plan for an agreement between the four major powers of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy will not be further developed for a while, because after the talks between British and French politicians in Paris yesterday, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon will return home by plane today to report the situation to the cabinet. It is said that the door has now been opened, so that French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet can continue the discussion in London within days. Judging from the warm welcome given to Prime Minister Mussolini by the Italian Senate and Chamber of Deputies, this plan is obviously supported by the Italian government and the public. However, the British House of Commons must wait for MacDonald to explain it in detail before taking action. One thing is certain now, that is, if the United Kingdom's responsibilities in Europe are increased in any way, it will not be approved by the House of Commons. This plan has undoubtedly relaxed the tension in Europe in the past two weeks and restored hope for the maintenance of peace. However, although Germany has expressed its approval, the nationalistic fervor revealed by Boetzel in the German Parliament's opening yesterday, and German Chancellor Hitler's repeated denial that Germany was the culprit of the European War, are clearly out of touch with the times. (Reuter dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>(Geneva) After consulting with the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Henderson and the Presidium, it was decided to suggest to the General Committee at its meeting on Thursday that the Disarmament Conference be temporarily suspended until after Easter. This is because the Italian Prime Minister recently proposed a plan, and Britain and France are still in consultation, so the Disarmament Conference must be temporarily suspended.

<h3>Red Peril Brewing Internally in the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>MacDonald's Trip to Rome</p>
<p>Rumored to Be Related to Dealing with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that British Prime Minister MacDonald's visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this time, in addition to rescuing the endangered Disarmament Conference, also has a major role in secret. It was once rumored here that the three giants of Britain's MacDonald, Italy's Mussolini, and Germany's Hitler would meet in Traeshah, a city on Lake Madreulan in Italy, to jointly seek to save the situation. This is because there is a dark shadow of red terror lurking inside the United Kingdom today. Recently, the Moscow Communist Party issued an important secret order to the British Communist Party, the content of which was to launch a red revolution in the United Kingdom in May 1936 and establish a Soviet government. In the next three years, it will strive to intensify the secret movement and focus all its efforts on turning the British army, navy, and police red. After this conspiracy was revealed in London's Daily Express on the 12th of this month, it aroused great attention from all Londoners. The deterioration of British-Soviet relations, and the recent arrest of British businessmen residing in the Soviet Union by the Soviet government, is its prelude. It is said that MacDonald's trip to Italy is related to dealing with the Soviet Union. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>A Coup Brewing in Japan</p>
<h3>Saito Still Plans to Cling to Power</h3>
<p>(Tokyo dispatch) Amidst the recent rumors of a political upheaval brewing in Japan, the current cabinet will resign en masse after the end of this parliamentary session, which has caused a great uproar. In response, Prime Minister Saito recently made a resolute statement, believing that in this extraordinary period, the current cabinet believes that its mission has not yet ended, so even after the end of the parliament, it will not retire, but will continue to remain in office and serve the country diligently. This is because the independent diplomacy after withdrawing from the League of Nations has not been established, the foundation of the national financial economy has not been stabilized, and the major cases controlled by the military have not been resolved, so the mission of the current cabinet has not been completed. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi visited Prime Minister Saito at 9 a.m. today for a secret talk lasting about an hour. The meeting between the two was not about the budget issue. It is expected that Finance Minister Takahashi had expressed considerable opinions. Although the content of the talk was not made public, it was discussed the timing of resignation and the issue of relinquishing responsibility after the end of the Diet. After meeting with Takahashi, Saito personally visited Interior Minister Yamamoto to discuss the issue of advancing or retreating after the Diet. Prime Minister Saito is also scheduled to visit Duke Saionji in Okitsu after the Diet. Although the nominal reason is to report on the progress of the Diet, in reality it is to discuss the issue of the successor cabinet. Political circles speculate that the fate of the Saito cabinet will not escape the difficult situation in mid-May. (China United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Russian New Envoy Visits Uchida</p>
<h3>Re-mentions Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>Leaves with No Results</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Russian ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Uchida today and raised the issue of a Russian-Japanese non-aggression treaty. Foreign Minister Uchida replied that the Russian-Japanese "Manchuria" Committee must first give it considerable consideration. Through the cooperation of the three countries, the goal of Russian-Japanese non-aggression can be achieved. If Russia is willing to consider the case, Japan will immediately conduct substantive discussions on the non-aggression treaty. As a result, the Russian-Japanese non-aggression treaty ended without good results again. (China United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Japanese Privy Council New Initiative</p>
<h3>Diplomacy Directly Under the Emperor</h3>
<p>Advocates Setting Up a Diplomatic Investigation Council</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, various parties have requested the establishment of an organization like the Diplomatic General Staff Headquarters to decide on national policies regarding diplomacy and to handle diplomatic issues expeditiously. The Privy Council had advocated the establishment of a diplomatic investigation council directly under the Emperor during the Terauchi cabinet to achieve this goal. Now that Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it is necessary to thoroughly implement independent diplomacy and enable the powers to recognize Japan's righteous position that it failed to advocate at the League of Nations conference. For this purpose, it is absolutely necessary to establish a large organization like the Diplomatic Investigation Council and implement a tough diplomacy. Recently, the Privy Council conveyed the internal opinions of the Privy Council to the government unofficially on this issue. The government seems to be considering it.

<p>German Personnel Concerned About</p>
<h3>Issue of Japanese Mandated Territories</h3>
<p>(Geneva) How the former German colonies in the Pacific, which are currently under Japanese mandate, will be handled after Japan withdraws from the League of Nations is a matter of great concern to German government personnel. According to semi-official sources, German opinion is that Japan's clear declaration of advocating continuing to exercise its mandated authority over the Pacific Islands has raised a very serious issue. This issue is of great importance to Germany. If it is resolved from an international perspective, the authority to resolve this issue should belong to the League of Nations Administrative Council and the Mandates Commission. It also said that when the League of Nations accepts the issue, Germany will come forward to defend its position. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Commercial Vessels Rented for Military Use</p>
<h3>Should Still Be Under the Administration of the Navigation Bureau</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications believes that once domestic commercial vessels are rented by military and political agencies, they use the provisions of the Maritime Commerce Law as an excuse to be exempt from the administration of the Navigation Bureau, which is detrimental to navigation administration. Therefore, it has consulted the Ministry of Military Affairs and the provincial governments to strictly crack down on this practice and explain that the ships specifically used for public service as stated in the Maritime Commerce Law refer to warships, customs patrol boats, quarantine ships, and the like. As for commercial vessels temporarily rented for public use, they must not be taken as an example. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Two Railways Allocate Funds to Repay Old Debts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Last year, the Shanghai War caused huge losses to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. After the war, business plummeted again, so the debts owed to the China-British Bank Corporation could not be repaid as scheduled. However, in order to maintain the credit of China's state-owned railways, Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, has repeatedly instructed various railways to find ways to repay the due foreign debts as soon as possible. Therefore, since the appointment of Huang Shao as the director and deputy director of the two railways, they have been trying to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and have designated a portion of the railway bureau's daily income to repay foreign debts. The results after the trial run were excellent. The income in March has greatly increased compared to January. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has also repaid part of its old debts, and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has also paid in full the first installment of the loan for purchasing cars from the China-British Bank Corporation several years ago. It is heard that if the situation is peaceful, the situation of the two railways will improve even more. (Reuter dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Repairing the Subgrade of the West Wei Section</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Provincial Government Advocates Work Relief</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shaanxi Provincial Government telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, advocating work relief to repair the subgrade of the West Wei Section.

It said that providing work relief to build the subgrade of the West Wei Section can advance the railway construction and reduce the number of refugees, which is very sympathetic. However, due to insufficient funds, it cannot be carried out at the same time. If the Shaanxi Provincial Government can raise relief funds for work relief to support the railway construction, the Ministry will send personnel to consult, and has replied by telegram, hoping that it will agree immediately to rely on the design.

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd – When the parliament reconvenes tomorrow, the National Socialist Party and its allied parties will propose an important bill granting the government full administrative power for a period of four years.

(2) Such laws may deviate from the constitution, provided they do not harm the rights of parliament and the Federal Council or the rights of the president. (3) Such laws will be drafted by the Chancellor and implemented on the day of promulgation, provided that Articles 68 and 77 of the constitution are not violated. (4) Treaties with foreign countries regarding German legal matters do not require the approval of parliament or the Federal Council. (5) The bill takes effect on the day of promulgation and expires on April 1, 1937, or on the day the current parliament is replaced.</p>

President Hindenburg, Chancellor Hitler, and the former Crown Prince were all central figures in the assembly. Although the throne in the church was vacant, Germany's respect for the royal family could still be seen in the two salutes given by President Hindenburg to the former Crown Prince with his marshal's baton before and after the ceremony. President Hindenburg addressed the parliament, warning, "Gentlemen, the responsibilities before you are great and complex. I hope that the new parliament will devote its loyalty to assist the government. The ground on which we stand today reminds us forever that Prussia's greatness was due to its fear of Heaven, dedication to duty, courage in taking responsibility, and public loyalty and patriotism."</p>

<h3>Unemployment Relief Plan</h3>
<p>Proposed Construction of Afforestation and Water Conservancy Projects</p>
<p>To Solve the Livelihoods of Millions</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 21st – US President Roosevelt today sent a special message to Congress, detailing the unemployment relief plan. He proposed that Congress immediately establish a bureau to register workers, add federal relief commissioners with the power of wartime food and coal commission members, and manage the average distribution of work matters. He also requested that Congress provide special subsidies to states that are carrying out public relief work, establish an engineering bureau to allocate subsidies, and supervise all engineering plans. The central government plans to hire 250,000 unemployed people in the first batch to engage in afforestation and flood prevention projects. Other public works projects will be submitted to Congress one after another and are currently being studied with technical advisors. In addition, the message also detailed the moral dangers of prolonged idleness, and the President must prevent it whenever possible.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 21st – After President Roosevelt's unemployment relief message was sent to Congress today, Representative Barnes of the House immediately proposed to the Labor Committee to recruit a labor force, organize them using the army enlistment method, and provide them with food, clothing, and housing, plus a monthly salary of thirty yuan. All unemployed workers who wish to join the government's afforestation work should join the labor force. However, labor representatives believe that this is close to forced labor and are vigorously opposed.</p>

<h3>Russo-Polish Trade Agreement Renewed</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 21st – Polish Senator Ivanovsky, accompanied by representatives from the textile, metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, and agricultural and commercial sectors, came to Moscow to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union on renewing the trade agreement. The trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Poland was signed seven years ago, and the current Soviet-Polish Trading Company was established based on that agreement. The Soviet-Polish Trading Company is jointly run by the governments of the two countries and serves as a mediator to promote economic relations between the two countries. Its performance has been quite good. Now that the trade agreement is about to expire, both parties are trying to renew it. The All-Union Chamber of Commerce of the Soviet Union held a meeting to warmly welcome the Polish delegation. Polish Ambassador Rokahivski and newspaper reporters attended the meeting. Ivanovsky said in his speech that the Polish side is paying close attention to the economic development of the Soviet Union and also hopes that the Soviet Union can send a delegation to Poland to investigate the actual situation of Polish industry. Such a delegation will be warmly welcomed by all sectors of Warsaw, and the results will further enhance the friendship between the two countries.</p>
<p>British Labor Party Members</p>
<h3>Army Reduction Motion</h3>
<p>Was Rejected</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st – During the House of Commons meeting today, Labor Party member Attlee proposed a motion to reduce the size of the army, saying that if Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan is successful, it is necessary to revise the number of army personnel inside and outside the UK. Cooper, the Financial Secretary of the Army Department, replied that the army is not for use in European wars, but to maintain security within the British Empire. If 100,000 people are reduced according to some people's suggestions, other powers will think that Britain has lost its mind. Subsequently, Attlee's motion was put to a vote and was defeated by 270 votes to 30. Another opposition party member's motion to reduce the number of the Royal Air Force was also defeated by 212 votes to 28.</p>

Senator Pittman said that President Roosevelt told congressional leaders that he was paying close attention to the issue of restoring the purchasing power of silver. Pittman plans to discuss this matter with Treasury Secretary Woodin in a few days, and then discuss it with the President. Pittman stated to President Roosevelt last night that he intends to meet with the President in a few days in order to agree on legislation that will neither harm the gold standard nor restore the normal purchasing power of silver coins in the world.</p>

<h3>Re-convocation of the Special Assembly of the League of Nations (Continued)</h3>
<p>However, the Committee of Nineteen also pointed out that the provisions of Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Covenant may only be invoked by the Assembly. Therefore, if there are any further proposals from China and Japan, they may still be submitted to the Committee of Nineteen for consideration. Therefore, while preparing the report in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, paragraph 4, the path to reconciliation has not been cut off.</p>
<p>At the time of drafting this report, the Japanese delegation submitted new proposals to the committee. Although the proposed amendments were fewer than those submitted in December and January, there were still doubts about the meaning of these amendments (especially regarding the amendment to paragraph 4 of the first draft), which were significant. Therefore, it was necessary to ask the Japanese delegation for clarification. According to the original text of the first draft resolution, a committee was established, whose responsibility was to negotiate a solution to the case with the parties to the dispute based on the principles of Chapter 9 of the Investigation Commission report and paying attention to the recommendations of Chapter 10 of the same report. The amendment proposed by the Japanese delegation stated that "the Committee of Nineteen should be responsible for striving to jointly obtain a method of reconciliation of the case with the parties to the dispute. The method obtained should be based on the principles and conclusions of Chapter 9 of the Investigation Commission report and apply these principles and conclusions to the events that have already developed."</p>
<p>The Committee of Nineteen believes that the scope of this proposal by Japan should be clearly defined. If the method of resolution is started based on a misunderstanding, it would be unsuitable for the League of Nations and its members. China has clearly explained its views on the current authorities in Manchuria. The investigation team sent to the area by the Executive Yuan has also clearly explained its nature. In the successive debates of the Assembly, the general opinion is that the solution to this case should be sought in the principles stated in Chapter 9 of the Investigation Commission report. Does the Japanese government accept the general opinion of the League of Nations, or does it still insist on its views when it first submitted the amendment, arguing that Principles 7 and 8 should not be discussed? In order to avoid misunderstandings, the Committee of Nineteen asked Japan whether the Japanese government recognized Principle 7 of Chapter 9 of the Investigation Commission report as one of the bases for reconciliation. This question was raised to the Japanese delegation on February 8.</p>
<p>After receiving the above question, the Japanese delegation replied on the 14th of the same month that the Japanese government firmly believes that the only guarantee of peace in the Far East is the maintenance and recognition of "Manchukuo," and that the entire Sino-Japanese dispute will eventually be resolved on this basis. In this regard, the Committee of Nineteen, although extremely regrettable, cannot but recognize that its efforts at reconciliation have been exhausted and can no longer be of service.</p>
<p>The above is the current situation of the League of Nations. Since September 21, 1931, the Executive Yuan in the past and the Assembly in the future have strived to pursue a solution that can be agreed upon by both parties in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant. This is exactly seventeen months. When the dispute first arose, the Executive Yuan received a guarantee from the Japanese side that the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the South Manchuria Railway area, which was already beginning at that time, would be completed as quickly as possible within the possible range.</p>
<p>Today, the three eastern provinces have been occupied, Japanese troops are attacking Shanhaiguan along the Great Wall, and activities to occupy Rehe are also said to be in preparation.</p>
<p>The method of reconciliation in this case, of course, cannot be considered to have been cut off before the Assembly passes the report in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Covenant. However, I am reluctant to call on both parties to make further efforts at reconciliation, because in order to achieve success, it is not only necessary to have new proposals that can be accepted by the Assembly, but also the Assembly must first obtain guarantees that the current situation will not become more severe and that military actions will not occur again.</p>
<p>However, I am reluctant to propose that the Assembly consider this report today. At this critical moment, we should not act hastily. The report was only distributed to the members last Friday, and governments should be given sufficient time to transmit instructions to their delegations. I suggest that the Assembly reconvene next Friday, the 24th, to begin discussing this draft report."</p>
<p>Careful consideration of the above text, although it does not explicitly condemn Japan, the crime of undermining mediation is undeniable. (Sent from Geneva on February 22)</p>
<h3>Hunan National Salvation Loan</h3>
<p>Committee established on schedule, principal and interest to be repaid in twenty years</p>
<p>Changsha correspondence: Hunan is raising a national salvation loan of five million yuan to serve as funds for national disaster relief and maintaining provincial defense. The annual interest rate is 4%, and the field tax of the entire province of Hunan is used as the repayment fund. Starting from the 24th year of the Republic, it will be repaid in installments over 20 years by drawing lots. The face value is divided into six types: five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan. Each county and city in the province has established a national salvation loan raising committee. In Changsha City, it is organized by the Municipal Government Office, the Municipal Party Department, the Standing Committee members, the Standing Committee members of the Municipal Education Association, and five impartial gentry appointed by the Director of the Municipal Government Office as members. In addition, the 75 counties are organized by the county magistrate of each county, the director of the Provincial Tax Collection Bureau, the standing committee members of the County Party Department, the security team leader or the deputy director of the household regiment, the director of the Finance Bureau, the director of the Public Security Bureau, the director of the Education Bureau, the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and three to five impartial gentry appointed by the county magistrate of each county as members. All are required to be established on April 1st and start raising funds, and the full amount must be raised by the end of June this year. It is estimated that Changsha City will be assigned to raise 300,000 yuan, and the rest of the counties will be assigned to raise at least 10,000 yuan depending on the situation, and the rest may be 50,000 or 100,000 yuan. A National Salvation Loan Supervision Committee will be established in the province, with Peng Guojun, Xie Zuyuan, Cao Dianqiu, Huang Daheng, Zhang Muguan, Peng Zhaohuang, Chen Runlin, Zhao Heng, Xie Guozhao, Liu Yuezhi, Zhou Anhan, Peng Shidi, Meng Qingxuan, Li Jingtao, and Xiao Enzhen, fifteen impartial gentry recommended by the joint conference of the Party, government and military, as members to keep the loan and supervise its use.

The repayment and interest payment schedule for all national salvation loans has been determined and announced by the provincial government. (March 20)</p>
<p>British Newspaper</p>
<h3>Publishes New Yellow Peril Theory</h3>
<p>Due to Threats from Japanese Commerce</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun of the 16th, recently, British industrialists are very panicked by the rapid rise of Japanese rayon. A liberal evening newspaper published a "New Yellow Peril Theory" on the 14th, stating that Japanese cotton cloth is not only seizing the trade of the Orient and India, but even invading the British market. British rayon is also suffering a major blow. Six years ago, Japan's production volume was the ninth in the world, last year it became four times that amount, and this year it is second only to the United States, accounting for the second largest in the world. Five years ago, the United Kingdom exceeded Japan by eight times, but last year Japan was three times more than the United Kingdom. The reason for this is that labor costs are low. Female workers in the United Kingdom are eight times more expensive than in Japan, and male workers are ten times more expensive. Therefore, it is greatly affected. As for tariff barriers, they are not a problem. From this point of view, the Yellow Peril warned by the former German Emperor is now coming true. The danger of Japan coercing industrial civilization with low wages is even greater than its military threat. Countries that want to maintain reasonable standards of national life should adopt a policy of not allowing goods produced by slave labor to be imported into the country.</p>

<h3>Zheng Jicheng Released from Prison</h3>
<p>(Determined to Go to the Front Lines to Kill the Enemy)</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zheng Jicheng assassinated Zhang Zongchang at Jinan Jinpu Railway Station on September 3rd last year, avenging his stepfather Zheng Jinsheng. After the incident, Zheng surrendered himself to the station's law enforcement team and was detained that evening at the Third Route Army's Military Law Office. On the 26th of that month, he was transferred from the Military Law Office to the Jinan Local Court Prosecutor's Office for trial. After several court interrogations, Zheng directly admitted to the assassination. On October 29th, the Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against Zheng Jicheng for premeditated murder. After two court debates, the court sentenced Zheng Jicheng guilty of premeditated murder, punishable by death. However, due to his self-surrender and extenuating circumstances, he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and seven years deprivation of civil rights. Zheng initially declared his dissatisfaction and appealed to the Shandong High Court. Subsequently, the Provincial Party Headquarters, local public organizations, and various dignitaries, due to Zhang Zongchang's various crimes during his lifetime, all praised Zheng's actions and sent telegrams to the Central Government, requesting a pardon for Zheng, so that law and human sentiment could be reconciled. Zheng Jicheng also requested to withdraw his appeal and awaited the Central Government's decision. For the sake of prudence, the Judicial Yuan specially reviewed the entire file of the case. The High Court then sent the entire case file to Beijing on February 2nd. After several studies, the Judicial Yuan finally submitted a request to the National Government for Zheng to be pardoned. On the 11th, the National Government issued a special pardon order, instructing the Judicial Yuan to order the Shandong High Court to execute it. Only today (the 20th) was Zheng brought out of the detention center and released home. Counting from September 26th last year, when Zheng entered prison, to March 20th this year, when he was released, he spent less than half a year in prison. All sectors of Jinan specially welcomed Zheng upon his release and presented him with gifts. Furthermore, when Zheng was not yet released, he expressed his willingness to destroy his home to save the country in the face of the approaching foreign invasion after regaining his freedom. Now that he has been released, he may soon fulfill his previous words and work hard to save the country. The circumstances before and after Zheng's release are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Wu Zhenzan's Conversation) The reporter heard that Zheng would be released and return home today, so he specially visited Wu Zhenzan, the president of the Shandong High Court, to inquire about everything. According to his statement, "I have been a judge for more than ten years, and Zheng Jicheng is the first case I have handled for a special pardon. Since Zheng has received a special pardon from the Central Government, all formalities can be waived. After receiving the Judicial Yuan's instructions, this court has ordered the local court prosecutor's office to handle it accordingly. There should be no delay, and he can be released and return home today."</p>
<p>(Judicial Yuan Instruction) National Government Judicial Yuan Instruction, Instruction No. 57, to Wu Zhenzan, President of the Shandong High Court, for compliance. The case of Zheng Jicheng's murder and sentencing to imprisonment was previously reviewed by this Yuan, and a request for a pardon was submitted. Now, the National Government's Civil Service Office's public letter of the 14th of this month states, "The National Government orders, according to the Judicial Yuan's report, Zheng Jicheng assassinated Zhang at the station because his stepfather Zheng Jinsheng was killed by Zhang Zongchang. Afterwards, he surrendered himself to the law enforcement officers. He violated criminal law for avenging his father, which is understandable. Now, party headquarters of various provinces, cities, and counties, and various mass organizations have requested a special pardon. All original sentences of the said offender are requested to be exempted from execution in accordance with the law to show compassion." It should be approved immediately, and in accordance with Article 6 of the revised Organic Law of the National Government of the Republic of China, it is hereby declared that Zheng Jicheng, who was originally sentenced to seven years of fixed-term imprisonment, is granted a special pardon to exempt him from execution to show compassion. This order, etc., is hereby recorded and sent to the aforementioned court for compliance. The case files and evidence are returned. This order, a total of eleven case files and one piece of evidence are returned.</p>
<p>(Local Prosecutor's Office Court Session) At 3:30 PM on the 2nd, the Local Court Prosecutor's Office held the second investigation session. The prosecutors present were Zhu Weiran and Zhu Fengxiang. Zheng was brought to the court from the detention center. Zheng was still wearing a silk gray-green cotton robe, with a gray cloth gown on the outside, and bareheaded. After arriving at the court, the prosecutors first asked his name and age, and he answered, Zheng Jicheng, forty-one years old, from Beixindian, Licheng County, residing at No. 8 Caiyuanzi Street and No. 7 Bianzhi Alley in the city. Before the murder, he was the director of the Charity Association. Prosecutor Zhu Weiran said, "Today's hearing is for your case of killing Zhang Zongchang. On October 29th last year, this office filed a lawsuit, and the local court sentenced you to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. The number of days of detention before the sentence was commuted at a rate of two days for one day. Afterwards, you appealed, and then you requested to withdraw it during the second instance. Now, the Judicial Yuan has submitted a request to the National Government for a special pardon, and the pardon order has arrived. Your imprisonment will not be executed, and you can leave immediately." Zheng said that the appeal was under a woman's name. Zhu said that relatives could appeal. Zheng asked if there were any official matters concerning him. Zhu replied, "No." Zheng then signed and left the court. There were many onlookers outside the court, showing the public's attention to Zheng.</p>
<p>(Go to the Front Lines to Kill the Enemy) After leaving the court, Zheng spoke with reporters, stating that his uncle (Zheng Jinsheng) and he were revolutionaries who should not bear grudges even when killed. However, Zhang Zongchang should not have killed his uncle and then tried to kill him, and ransacked his home six times, so he had to kill him. Zhang Zongchang was a counter-revolutionary, and his son has now surrendered to a puppet state, also becoming a counter-revolutionary. Having killed Zongchang before, he should now kill his son. Therefore, he is determined to devote his personal strength to go to the Rehe front lines to kill the enemy. Although he currently has no weapons, the anti-Japanese generals Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun are old comrades-in-arms, and he can go there to serve, even at the cost of his life. Because he is originally a revolutionary soldier and cannot lose his true colors. His family is destitute, his old mother is still alive, his brother Jihe and his younger brother Jizhi are both businessmen, his wife Li Shuyun, and his two sons are both deceased. His uncle's family has four young brothers, Jichun, Jiquan, and others, who have only a few dozen acres of ancestral land, and their lives are extremely difficult. But he has never cared about family matters. In recent years, while in Jinan, Chairman Han, Shi Hanzhang (You San), and Wen Boting (Mayor of Jinan) were old friends who provided continuous support. Even after entering the detention center, he relied on them for his livelihood. The warden Ren Shiwu, the chief warden Ren Xuetao, and all the staff treated him exceptionally well, for which he is deeply grateful. (20th)</p>

<h3>The Reality of the Stopgap Project for Tap Water</h3>
<p>No Water Shortage This Summer, No Worries About Avoiding the Heat</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Municipal Public Works Bureau's Waterworks has now published the actual situation of the stopgap project for tap water, stating, "This city has been developing year by year, and commerce and industry have been gradually prospering. Public land has been widely opened, resulting in a surge in construction and a rapid increase in the population. The sales of tap water have been increasing day by day. In recent years, wells and machines have been added to ensure that the water supply is not lacking. Due to financial and time constraints, all facilities have not been fully completed, so the increase in water volume is ultimately limited. Once there is a drought and the water source is short, or when there is a particularly large amount of water used in the summer, supply often cannot meet demand. Last summer, the hot period was longer, and the consumption of water was too large, resulting in a particularly severe water shortage. The higher areas often suffered from water outages due to excessive anti-pressure. Furthermore, the water distribution pipes on the roads were mostly installed during the German administration and have been in use for more than thirty years. The interior is mostly silted and rusted, greatly reducing the capacity and causing significant obstruction. During the water shortage period, the water flow was even more unsatisfactory. The Zhan Shan area is far from the city, and most of the water passing through the water distribution pipes is used along the way. Also, because the original water distribution pipe in that area had too small a diameter, it could not store and transport a large amount of water, so the shortage was even more acute. Although the difficult period of water shortage was勉强 overcome at that time by taking urgent measures, the plant deeply regrets the hardship suffered by the citizens due to this water shortage. To make the water supply sufficient, we must wait for开源疏浚 to be effective. In order to achieve this goal, the plant has been actively carrying out plans and rushing to complete unfinished projects, and to make supplementary facilities. The construction of various projects is listed below:</p>
<p>(Regarding Various Aspects of 开源) (1) Completed five newly dug brick wells in the west river of the Baisha River water source area, and installed 520 meters of water absorption pipes, so that the water at the bottom of the downstream river can converge into the west plant collection well. A 160-horsepower electric water lifting machine is added to the machine room of the well to fully attract water. It is estimated that the water volume can be increased by more than 3,000 tons per day. (2) The discharge of the emergency wells No. 4 and 5 downstream of the Licun water source is extremely strong, but due to the lack of old equipment, water cannot be sent as much as possible. Now, more than 1,000 meters of 150 mm diameter iron pipes have been modified, and a water lifting machine and a vacuum machine have been added. Also, Emergency Well No. 1 has been repaired and equipped, and auxiliary machines and water inlet pipes have been added to the machine room of the collection well. The above three wells are fully opened to increase the water level of the collection well, which can also increase the water volume by more than 2,000 tons per day. (3) A water lifting machine room is built between the two newly dug wells north of Taipingjiao, equipped with a 5-horsepower electric water lifting machine, and a water tower is set up at the high end of the south to prepare for pumping well water to the water tower to supplement the lack of water in the Zhan Shan area. It is estimated that the water volume can also be increased by several hundred tons per day.</p>
<p>(Regarding Various Aspects of 浚流) (1) The Baisha River water source is about 20 kilometers away from the Storage Mountain, and the reservoir on the Storage Mountain is about 70 meters above sea level. The water from the water source is delivered through a long distance of 20 kilometers, and then climbs a high mountain of 70 meters, resisting the static water pressure of the reservoir. Therefore, although the pressure of the water lifting machine at the water source reaches the maximum limit, it is still difficult to increase the water volume. Now, a reservoir of several thousand cubic meters is added next to Mongolia Road, and a machine room is built, equipped with three 160-horsepower electric water lifting machines, so that the water sent from the water source flows smoothly into the pool, and then it is pumped to the Storage Mountain Pool, so that the pressure is reduced and water delivery is convenient. The city can get an additional 3,000 to 4,000 tons of water per day. (2) There is an existing reservoir next to Taiping Mountain Road that can store 200 tons of water. It is now being repaired and a 125 mm water pipe is installed to connect with the Wendeng Road and Taipingjiao water supply pipes. A water stop gate is installed there, so that when the pressure is high at night, water can enter the pool for storage, and when the pressure is low during the day, water can flow out of the pool to supplement the lack of water in the Taipingjiao area. (3) A 125 mm diameter water pipe from the old one in front of the Municipal Middle School is connected to the water distribution pipes in Taipingjiao and Zhan Shan roads, so that the water sent from the city can be branched out smoothly. With the addition of the Taiping Mountain Road Reservoir and the Taipingjiao Water Tower, the Zhan Shan area can avoid the risk of water shortage. (4) Replace the 125 mm water distribution pipe from the Taishan Road intersection, via Dengzhou Road, to the north end of Yindao Road with a 200 mm water pipe, and connect it with the Licun water supply trunk pipe. During the summer season, the water gate at the junction can be opened to allow the water from the Licun water source to be directly injected into Qidong Road, Laiwu Road, etc. without going through the Storage Mountain, and the water gates in the Jinshuo Road area with higher area, which are connected to the water distribution pipes in the lower areas of the city, can be closed at the same time to prevent the water from flowing downwards, thus facilitating water use in high places. (5) Increase the water distribution pipes on Yindao Road and Qihe Road to connect with the Fushan Road pipeline, so that the water use in higher areas on Fushan Road and Qixia Road can be supplied through the new water pipe on Dengzhou Road, the same as Qidong Road and Laiwu Road. (6) A 125 mm water pipe is added between Guanhai Road and Guanxiang Mountain, one end connected to the downward water pipe of the Guanxiang Mountain Reservoir, and the other end connected to the Guanhaishan water distribution pipe. When there is a water shortage in summer, the water gate between Guanhai Road and Pingyuan Road can be closed, and the water gate of the Guanxiang Mountain Reservoir can be opened to allow the water stored in the pool to be supplied to Guanxiangshan Road and Guanhai 1st and 2nd Roads through the newly installed water pipe. (7)通洩 and replace the heavily silted water distribution pipes on Taiping University, Laiyang, Anhui and other roads, so that water can be fully distributed to avoid the problem of insufficient water flow on various roads in the city.</p>
<p>The above various projects cost a total of more than 200,000 yuan. In addition, the fundamental solution for a large-capacity reservoir's water source has also been started. Regardless of when the project can be effective, even in terms of the existing stopgap project, it is expected that the summer water shortage can be avoided in the future.</p>

<h3>Film Shooting Injures Actors</h3>
<p>Liu Chunshan, a famous Shanghai comedian, recently brought more than a dozen actors from the Happy Film Company and ten dwarfs to Songjiang to shoot a film. The title of the play is "拼命" (Desperate). The plot is about dwarfs playing Japanese slaves and Liu playing an officer commanding troops to resist the Japanese slaves. Yesterday (21st), when shooting a confrontation scene at the South Primary School playground, gunpowder was buried underground and ignited with a fuse. When the actor Xie Yiguang was igniting it, the fuse was too short and exploded as soon as it was ignited. Xie was unable to avoid it and was injured in the face. Qiang, a photographer, was injured in both eyes by gravel. The performance was stopped immediately, and the injured actors Xie and Qiang were taken to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Qiang's eyes may be blinded, and Xie's injuries are easier to treat. After this sacrifice, the film will definitely be popular in all ports when it is released in the future.</p>
<h3>Fugitive Escapes from Detention Center</h3>
<p>Since Warden Xiong took over the Ning, there are many bricks and stones in front of the detention center. Recently, he thought of having inmates build a head gate, and work has begun. Unexpectedly, when working the day before, Gu A'gen, a漕涇贩 who was taking bricks and stones, took the opportunity to escape when the guards were negligent. By the time the warden was informed and sent people to track him down, there was no trace of him. Warden Xiong has reported to the Prosecutor's Office and sent the guards to the Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. According to Liu, the investigation has been concluded, and the lawsuit has been filed with the Criminal Court. Therefore, the prison has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau asking them to pay attention to the investigation and arrest him.</p>

<h3>International Chamber of Commerce Conference</h3>
<h3>Our Country Decides to Stop Participating</h3>
<p>A Telegram Will Be Sent to Paris Soon</p>
<p>The Seventh International Chamber of Commerce Conference is scheduled to be held in Vienna on May 29th. The Chinese branch recently decided to stop attending this conference because of the national crisis and the participants are unwilling to go.

<h3>Aviation Association Establishes Aviation School</h3>
<p>School Site Has Been Negotiated</p>
<p>Borrowing Hongqiao Airport</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association will establish an aviation school to develop China's aviation industry and cultivate civil aviation talents. This proposal has been planned for a long time. The directors of the association believe that Shanghai is the most suitable place for the school site because Shanghai is the most developed commercial port in China. It is convenient to hire professors and purchase equipment, and the Aviation Association's headquarters is in Shanghai, so the management of the school will not be alienated. However, Shanghai lacks a large enough place for training. After discussion at the Standing Committee, it was decided to borrow the Hongqiao Airport of the Aviation Administration and temporarily borrow the training aircraft of the administration for teaching. Therefore, Lin Wojiang, the secretary-general of the association, was specially sent to Hangzhou to contact Ge Jingen, the director of the Aviation Administration. Lin returned to Shanghai the night before last. The reporter specially interviewed him about the negotiation process. According to him, Director Ge has agreed to borrow the site, but the borrowing of training aircraft is still under negotiation. Therefore, a meeting of the Standing Committee will be convened soon to report the negotiation process, and then discuss the next steps. Director Ge is very concerned about the association, so he also offered advice to establish a aircraft factory, starting from a small scale, whether it is self-made or repaired, to achieve the goal of self-made and self-repair. This idea is very good, so it will be reported to the Standing Committee for discussion.</p>
<h3>Telegrams of Bitter Battles Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>Condolences to Anti-Japanese Generals</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteers Support Association received telegrams from Commander Sun Dianying and Chairman Song Mingxuan yesterday, as well as various incoming and outgoing telegrams. The combined records are as follows:</p>
<p>Sun Reports on the Battle Situation: I respectfully received your telegram. Saving the country and killing the enemy is the duty of soldiers. I am deeply grateful to the gentlemen for their enthusiastic donations. The entire army will be even more motivated to supervise the troops and fight to the death with the Japanese pirates. The enemy has been reinforcing our Liangdigou positions in recent days and attacking our positions with cavalry, tanks, and field battles from time to time. In order to save ammunition, our soldiers calmly respond to the battle when the enemy comes to attack, and often do not return the guns. When the enemy rushes to the front, they rush out of the trenches and kill the enemy with big knives and hand grenades. White-blade hand-to-hand combat is most terrifying to the enemy. It is estimated that three enemy tanks have been destroyed and many trophies have been seized. This is specially telegraphed to express my gratitude. Sun Kuiyuan叩, 馬,</p>
<p>Song Greets Feng: I respectfully received your telegram. Wielding a weapon to resist foreign aggression is the responsibility of soldiers. I have accidentally won against a strong slave and was suddenly invited to be commended. My merit is small and my favor is great, and I am increasingly introspective. I am very grateful for Comrade Feng Shaoshan being recommended to go north to comfort and犒劳. The southern sky is in sight, and I will sweep the榻 to greet you. Special reply, Song Zheyuan叩, 馬.</p>
<h3>The Disarmament Conference Actually Restricts Our Air Force Development</h3>
<p>China's Number of Aircraft Only One-Fifth of Japan's, Leaving Us Without Self-Defense Capability; Resolutely Oppose</p>
<p>The World Disarmament Conference has reached a deadlock due to the issue of restricting air forces. Recently, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon proposed standards for restricting air forces, stipulating that the five major powers (Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan) should not exceed 500 aircraft, with other countries decreasing proportionally. China is limited to no more than 100 aircraft. The Disarmament Conference is scheduled to convene today (yesterday's telegram mentioned a postponement). Whether the proposal will pass and whether it can be implemented after passage remain uncertain. However, the people's call for national salvation through aviation deserves deep attention. Lin Wo-jiang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, told a New Sound News Agency reporter yesterday morning that China's coastline is extremely long and its borders vast, while its army and navy equipment cannot compare with those of the great powers. If the air force is further restricted, it will effectively place China in a position where it cannot defend itself. The people should resolutely oppose this. China's current air force is less than 100 aircraft. Whether we can build an air force sufficient for self-defense depends on the efforts of the people and the government. However, there is a huge difference between this and being restricted by international forces and unable to establish one at all.</p>
<p>Zhu Turns Liu Telegram: All colleagues are informed. I have just received a telegram from Commander Liu of Shimentown as follows: General Zhu Ziqiao, Greetings. After the enemy facing Shancha Ridge was repelled by us last night, I immediately sent a team to track and attack, clearing the battlefield and capturing more than a hundred steel helmets, countless backpacks and military supplies. We also found Manchurian maps, orders, diaries, and other items on the body of Colonel Shimamura, who died in battle. It has been confirmed that eight officers above the rank of captain were wounded or killed in this battle, including Captain Yoshida and Colonel Hayakawa. The enemy has now retreated to the vicinity of Banbi Mountain and is building fortifications. I am sending this telegram to you. Your humble servant, Liu Ruming, bows in respect, etc. Transmitted by Zhu Qinglan, Ma Wei-zong.</p>
<p>Yangzhen Telegram (titles omitted): I left the pass last year to investigate the true situation of the anti-Japanese civilians. Details have already been sent to Shanghai for publication. The Japanese army occupied our Chaoyang and Lingyuan counties because Tang's army retreated without a fight, preventing the national salvation army from providing support. Now, the armed civilians of the entire Rehe province are rising up to unite, consolidating strategic passes, and awaiting the opportunity to kill the enemy. We are currently in a period of shortage, during the season of continuous spring rain, lacking urgently needed supplies such as military raincoats, undershirts, uniforms, flour, salted fish, marching pots, and stoves. We hope that you will all join in overcoming national difficulties, assign personnel to solicit contributions, accumulate provisions, and transport them to the front lines to support the patriotic soldiers, encouraging their courage to kill the enemy and achieve results. This telegram is urgent. Wishing you daily peace. From Yang Zhen of Rehe, respectfully.</p>
<p>Telegram of Condolences to Song and Guan: The Shanghai Citizens' Federation sent a telegram yesterday to Army Commander Song and Division Commander Guan, stating: Greetings to Chairman Song Zheyuan and Division Commander Guan Linzheng of the Beiping Military Branch. The bloody battles at Xifengkou have struck fear into the enemy's hearts. If all the nation's troops were like this, how could the Northeast have fallen, Rehe been lost, and North China been endangered? We express our infinite admiration to the Chairman. We are deeply concerned and indignant about the Division Commander's injury during the counterattack at Gubeikou. We only hope that heaven will bless China and that recovery will come soon. We also pray that you take care of yourselves for the sake of the country. This telegram is sent as a message of condolences. We hope you understand. Shanghai Citizens' Federation, seal.</p>
<h3>Conversations with a Returnee from Shenyang</h3>
<p>The Tragic State of the People in the Northeast</p>
<p>A reporter from the Datong News Agency recently met with Mr. Wang Maosheng, who had secretly escaped from Shenyang to Shanghai, at his lodging. He recounted the tragic situation of the Japanese army's treatment of the people in the Northeast, filled with tears and blood, which was unbearable to hear. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Current State of the Puppet Regime: Mr. Wang began by saying that recently, after the Japanese army suffered heavy losses in attacking Xifengkou, the Japanese troops stationed in various parts of the puppet regime have been ordered to go to Rehe, reaching more than three divisions. This has left the internal defenses of the puppet regime extremely empty. Only a small number of Japanese military police and Chinese troops who have betrayed the country are maintaining local order in various places. Since the news of the Japanese army's defeat reached Manchuria, officials of all ranks in the puppet organization have been panicked. In addition, the guerrillas, who have broken up into smaller units, are lurking in various places, firing their guns at night as a show of force, further unsettling the puppet officials. In order to calm themselves, the puppet army immediately requested and received permission from the highest Japanese military authorities to transfer more than 4,000 military police from Korea and send them to various places to monitor the people, preventing them from secretly colluding with the guerrillas and launching surprise attacks. At the same time, the Japanese military authorities, fearing that the traitorous army might take restless actions, secretly deployed Japanese troops near the traitorous Chinese army, ostensibly to assist in maintaining security, but in reality to monitor them. As for the Japanese residents, due to the dangerous situation, they also spontaneously organized self-defense groups, which were formally established at the beginning of this month. The group has about 500 members, and weapons were obtained from the puppet military and political department. On the 14th of this month, the overseas Chinese military and political department, after receiving repeated telegrams of the Japanese army's defeat in Rehe, immediately declared special martial law. Residents were not allowed to go out after 5:00 p.m. During the day, pedestrians on the street were not allowed to talk to each other in groups of three or more, otherwise they would be punished with extreme penalties for disrupting public order and inciting popular discontent. Their state of panic has reached an extreme point.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Free Entry and Exit: Mr. Wang also said that the Manchurian puppet organization has recently been very strict in preventing residents from freely entering and leaving the territory. The purpose is to prevent plainclothes guerrilla units from infiltrating the interior. Anyone wishing to leave the territory must first provide detailed reasons and submit two full-body photos and a joint guarantee from two local shops to the local government.</p>
<p>The Future of the Guerrillas is Worrisome: Since the outbreak of the Rehe War, the Manchurian Japanese military authorities have adopted a policy of massacre against the guerrillas in various places, and have implemented a blockade to cut off the guerrillas' supplies. Although the guerrillas scattered throughout Manchuria have broken up into smaller units and are lurking in deep mountains and valleys, their food supplies have long been cut off and they are only living on wild vegetables. The Japanese army is sparing no effort in searching and killing them. Every time they capture a guerrilla, they are subjected to dismemberment by five horses or hung upside down from the treetops to let their blood flow downwards and die. If they encounter women, the young ones are first raped and then hacked to death with random knives, while the elderly are subjected to cruel instruments of torture and die. The tragic state is something I (Mr. Wang refers to himself) really cannot bear to describe again. If our government authorities do not recover Rehe as soon as possible and open up the supply route for the guerrillas, then hundreds of thousands of Chinese heroes will be lost to the hands of the Japanese pirates. I sincerely hope that the government officials will make a painful decision, issue a national mobilization order as soon as possible, and quickly leave the pass to recover the lost territory in order to save the people of the four provinces who are being trampled under the iron heel of the Japanese army and the hundreds of thousands of guerrillas who are sacrificing themselves for the country.</p>
<p>Ma Xiangbo, the Old Man of Ninety-Four</p>
<h3>Initiates the Society of Those Who Cannot Bear to See Suffering</h3>
<p>Hopes Fellow Citizens Will Emulate Father Lebbe and Participate in Implementation</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Father Lebbe, who has been living in China for thirty years, responded to Ma Xiangbo's founding of the Society of Those Who Cannot Bear to See Suffering by personally leading the first batch of rescue teams to the front lines of Xifengkou. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency made a special visit to Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the old man of ninety-four, and had the following conversation: (Reporter asked) Did the old gentleman initiate the "Society of Those Who Cannot Bear to See Suffering?" (Answer) Indeed, I initiated this action on November 11th of last year, specifically to rescue all the suffering compatriots in the war zones of the Northeast and the bandit areas of the South. I entrusted the Tianjin Yishibao to take charge of the event, and a large amount of cash and cotton clothing were raised, all of which were given to the National Salvation Association of Tianjin. Unfortunately, I am old and frail, able to speak but unable to act. My old friend Father Lebbe, in view of the bloodshed and death of the soldiers on the front lines, is actually showing the compassionate heart of "those who cannot bear to see suffering" and forming a rescue team. Father Lebbe is a highly respected clergyman internationally, so his personal trip to the front lines to carry out work is better than the empty talk on paper of the Peace Army advocated by London. I am also just talking on paper, but I hope that my fellow citizens will emulate Father Lebbe's implementation. (Question) What are the old gentleman's thoughts on the current situation? (Answer) Yesterday, I read in the newspaper that Mr. Wang Jingwei, in his first speech after returning to China, said that he was thinking of the hard work and sacrifices of the anti-Japanese soldiers on the front lines, and immediately expressed his deepest respect. At the same time, President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan also gave a lecture at the National Government, also to comfort the patriotic soldiers on the front lines, which shows that national opinion is unified and the whole nation is resisting foreign aggression and saving the country. We know that the soldiers on the front lines are respectable and lovable, but those who sacrifice themselves for resisting Japan are naturally even more lamentable and worthy of song. In order to reduce the suffering of the loyal and brave soldiers who sacrifice themselves for national salvation, in order to show that all compatriots unanimously do not forget the merits of the soldiers on the front lines, and to go to the front lines to carry out rescue work, such as the righteous actions promoted by Father Lebbe, will leave a deep impression in the minds of those who are saving the country, like the heroes of the anti-Japanese war at Xifengkou. According to the old man's observation, this kind of rescue team is no different from a suicide squad, because the Japanese army's atrocities have always disregarded the civilized customs of Europe and the United States, and often openly violated international laws of war, such as the bombing of ambulance vehicles and the killing of rescue teams during the previous Shanghai battles, which were recorded in detail in the Shanghai newspapers. However, in Shanghai, there were still various countries watching, and they were slightly more cautious. Now, in the illegal warfare outside the pass, they are doing everything possible. Therefore, I hope that all fellow citizens in the country will not forget the brave soldiers who are resisting the enemy, unite to help and provide frequent rescue. From the ruling personnel to the civilians, for the sake of the life and death of the country, they should all act like suicide squads and go to the front lines. Father Lebbe's trip is just a vanguard, not only promoting the spirit of Catholic universal love, but also in line with the ancient morality of "not inflicting heavy wounds" in the righteous wars of the Spring and Autumn period. I urge all fellow citizens to participate in the implementation together.</p>
<p>Continued Arrival</p>
<h3>Antiquities Shipped Out Last Night</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, 1,290 boxes of the second batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum being shipped south, along with 1,064 boxes of the first batch stored in Beijing, and 200 boxes of antiquities from the Ministry of Interior's Antiquities Exhibition Hall, totaling 2,554 boxes, arrived in Shanghai on the Kuaili, a vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, after being loaded from Beijing around 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. Due to the short time on that day, they could not be unloaded, so it was decided to start unloading yesterday morning. However, it rained heavily yesterday morning, and it did not clear until nearly noon, so the unloading was delayed until about 12:00 p.m. More than a dozen trucks from the Mao Tai and Shanghai搬场 Automobile Companies, and dozens of laborers, were divided into loading and unloading points. When the unloading began, the French Concession Police sent several Vietnamese police officers to the four corners of the Jinliyuan Pier to control pedestrians and vehicles entering and leaving the crossroads. Personnel were stationed along the route to ensure solemnity. The unloading was completed at 6:00 p.m. Currently, there are 3,608 boxes of antiquities stored in the warehouse at No. 26 Tianzhutang Street, with no remaining space to store the third batch of antiquities. As for the company of soldiers escorting the artifacts, their company commander, Zhao Zhong, is scheduled to return to Beijing on the original ship this morning.</p>
<h3>Northeast Thaws and Opens for Navigation, Huge Amounts of Food Shipped Out</h3>
<p>Two Million Bags of Flour</p>
<p>Forty to Fifty Thousand Bags of White Rice</p>
<p>Yingkou and Andong in the Northeast have been closed due to freezing since last winter, with navigation suspended for more than three months. Yesterday, the ice began to thaw, and Shanghai's merchant ships also resumed navigation to Yingkou yesterday. However, at the beginning of this thawing and opening of ships, Shanghai suddenly had a large amount of rice, flour, and other grains transported to the puppet regime. This matter is not only related to the people's livelihood but also violates the ban. Our reporter made a special trip to investigate the matter, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Ordering Large Quantities of Flour and Rice) At this time when the Japanese army is mobilizing to attack Rehe, the front lines need a huge amount of food. It is said that the Japanese army in the north eats rice, while the puppet Manchurian army eats flour. Therefore, the Northeast has recently come to Shanghai to purchase a large amount of flour, more than two million bags, mostly under the Yuanbing Chuan brand. They also secretly purchased 40,000 to 50,000 bags of white rice. The destinations are divided into two places. Before Yingkou thawed, it was loaded to Dalian. Now that Yingkou has thawed, it is directly loaded from Shanghai to that port for unloading. Various Shanghai Chinese and British merchants' ships are competing to load, including Haichang, Yu Da, Taifeng, Datong, Zhaoxing, Zhengji, and Taigu and other shipping companies.</p>
<p>(Navigation Resumes Yesterday) A telegram from Yingkou stated that the port has thawed and is scheduled to open on the 25th of this month. Shanghai ships began loading cargo to Yingkou yesterday. Datong Company's Tongsheng ship transported 2,400 bags of white rice and 104,000 bags of flour yesterday. Taigu's Zhejiang ship also carried more than 100,000 bags of flour. Taifeng's Fengxiang also sailed to Yingkou yesterday. According to the Jianghai Customs, it has long been forbidden to transport food to the Northeast, and the Ministry of Communications has also instructed various shipping bureaus not to load food to Anyinglian and other ports in the puppet regime. It is unknown how the customs is handling this.</p>
<p>(Forced Registration of Crew Members) When Yingkou and Andong were closed due to the river freezing last winter, the puppet regime issued a puppet order stating that when Chinese merchant ships arrive at the sea ports of the puppet regime, in addition to paying taxes, etc., Chinese ships sailing to Yingkou and Andong must also have the puppet customs inspect the ship and issue an inspection certificate before they can sail. It also ordered all Chinese ships arriving at Yingkou to register their crew members with the puppet regime, paying a registration fee of two to five yuan per person. The method is the same as our country's regulations. This time, it must be forcibly implemented.</p>
<p>(Situation of Strict Inspection) Dalian has banned the import of Chinese newspapers from Shanghai. If anyone is found carrying them, they will be heavily fined. Chinese people going to Dalian, Yingkou, or Andong from Shanghai must undergo special searches. In addition to unloading and inspecting luggage, even the lining of clothes and the lining of hats must be cut open on the spot with a knife and inspected by Japanese detectives, and viewed against the sunlight. If there is any discrepancy, they will be considered spies and arrested, and their lives will be difficult to protect.</p>
<p>American Church</p>
<h3>Also Affected by the Financial Storm</h3>
<p>Missionaries Will Generally Have Salaries Reduced</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, after the financial storm in the United States, the American churches propagating in China may also reduce their activities. It is reported that many churches have received telegrams from the United States, notifying them of the need for further salary reductions. Yesterday, a gentleman from the American Methodist Church told a reporter that, to his knowledge, various churches in the United States may generally reduce salaries by at least 25%. According to the salaries of the churches, they have previously been reduced, and the number of missionaries has also been reduced successively since 1927. It is feared that the number of people remaining in China is only half of what it was in 1927. Furthermore, those missionaries who request long vacations often cancel them in order to save money. Most of those who will return to China soon are those who will not return to China after their leave expires. However, the overall situation is still uncertain, and it is hoped that by June, it may return to normal.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Support National Salvation Through Aviation</h3>
<p>Colleagues in the Traffic Department of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company Plan to Donate: The Lianyi Society of the Traffic Department of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, in view of the extreme urgency of national salvation through aviation, convened its fifth council meeting at 8:00 p.m. on the 21st of this month to discuss implementation plans. The council members Li Linshu, Yan Yunjin, Zhong Runsheng, Wang Jun, Chen Bangjun, Zhao Fuxian, Pan Changlin, Cai Hongjun, and Zhang Wenhong attended. Yan Yunjin presided over the meeting, and Zhou Lianze recorded the minutes. The following resolutions were made: (1) The society will join the Chinese Aviation Association as a permanent member, with a membership fee of 500 yuan, to be raised through a theatrical performance by the Beijing Opera Department. All employees will do their best to purchase tickets, and a representatives' meeting will be convened at 8:00 p.m. on the 24th of this month to discuss purchase methods. (2) A drama department and a ticket department will be established to carry out the fundraising through theatrical performance. Li Linshu was appointed as the director of the ticket department, and Yan Yunjin was appointed as the director of the drama department. (3) The location and date of the theatrical performance will be decided at the representatives' meeting. (Remaining omitted)</p>
<p>The La Fei Garden Promotes National Salvation Through Aviation: Since Japan occupied the Northeast, colleagues in the La Fei Garden have made donations one after another. Although the La Fei Garden is an entertainment dance hall, its patriotic heart is no less than others. In the dance hall, they first launched a tea dance to support the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers. Including costs and ticket proceeds, a total of 2,147 yuan was raised, and employees' dinner expenses were also donated in full. They entrusted the Shanghai Bank to remit the funds to the Northeast. It is reported that they received a reply telegram from the soldiers on the front lines last month, expressing their gratitude. It is also reported that Mr. Feng Zengxiang of the hall launched an aviation salvation movement called the La Fei Team. Currently, there are more than 300 members joining the team, and they are making unremitting efforts. The results are quite optimistic, and it will be formally established soon.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Approves Exemption from Affixing Stamps</h3>

The Chamber immediately forwarded the request for exemption. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Finance has approved the request.

The shipping notes issued by the transportation industry are temporary notes issued by the shipping company to the carriers to ask the stores transporting goods to send the goods. They are not a substitute for the bill of lading or formal receipt. Since the bills of lading, etc., are all stamped in accordance with regulations, the shipping notes should be exempted from stamping. In addition to instructing the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to comply with this, you are instructed to forward this order for notification. This approval.</p>

<p>China Relief Association</p>
<h3>Medical Team Scheduled to Go North</h3>
<p>Army Commander Song's Representative Expresses Deep Agreement</p>
<p>The medical team of the China Relief Association is scheduled to go north on the 28th. Yesterday, the association specially dispatched Mr. Wu Jiang and Mr. Ma Naijun to the representative office of General Song Zheyuan in Shanghai for discussions. Mr. Sun Longji, the representative, expressed deep agreement and gave instructions on all matters. However, it is heard that the association's departure expenses are set at 3,000 yuan. In addition to the 1,000 yuan allocated from the relief fund, fundraising is difficult. Although assistance has been requested from public groups and people from all walks of life, the responders are few. Moreover, the deadline is approaching and cannot be delayed. The wounded soldiers and civilians on the front lines are groaning in pain and urgently need treatment, causing the team members to be extremely anxious. If there are people from all walks of life who have the compassion to relieve the hunger and thirst of others and are willing to provide assistance, either in cash or in kind, they will be greatly appreciated. Please send them directly to the association's general office at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Tibet Road, or to the Jincheng Bank on Jiangxi Road for collection. All income and expenditure of the association will be summarized and published in the newspaper to show the truth.</p>
<h3>Qu Wenliu to Regularly Go North for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Broadcast Appealed to All Circles for Donations</p>
<p>Qu Wenliu, a standing director of the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association for Relief of Northeastern Refugees, believes that the disaster in the Northeast urgently needs relief. He is scheduled to go north on the 25th of this month. Yesterday, he made a special broadcast on the Asia-America Radio to request generous donations from all circles. His words are recorded below.</p>
<p>"Reflecting on Mr. Ying Guang's previous broadcast at the Shanghai Broadcasting Radio Station, he reported on his personal visit to the Qinhuangdao area for disaster relief and the dispersal of people in the war zones. If we do not rush to provide relief, the soldiers will arrive and the people will leave, which is no different from strengthening the walls and clearing the fields ourselves, putting our compatriots on the front lines in mortal danger. I think you can still remember that the failure at Rehe and Gubeikou was due to the soldiers not being able to protect the people, and the people not being able to share the same hatred with the enemy. Now, refugees from Lingyuan, Kailu, Fuxin, Jianping, Chaoyang, Suidong, Beipiao, Nanling and other places within Rehe are fleeing inward in groups. The people of Zunhua and Jixian within Xifengkou, and Miyun and Huairou within Gubeikou, are constantly bombarded by airplanes and burned and killed, as the front lines are in fierce battle. If we do not urgently settle them, there will be bloody battles in the front, and escapes in the rear. People will have no support in life, no treatment for injuries, and no place to rest in death. It is not only a loss of land, but also a loss of our race. It is painful to speak of, and brings tears to think of. Alas, it is terrible!</p>
<p>Our association has repeatedly received reports from Feng Yangshan, a disaster relief specialist at the front lines, stating that refugees in the war zones are gathering together, lacking clothing and food, and having no place to live. To flee would be to disregard the soldiers on the front lines, which is unacceptable. To stay would be to share the soldiers' clothing and food, which would inevitably lead to mutual destruction. He requested that a large amount of relief supplies be urgently raised for prompt assistance. Therefore, we have appointed Mr. Ying Guang to continue to go north for disaster relief, to fulfill the obligations of a citizen. Mr. Ying Guang has previously traveled to the front lines and our office knows the situation well. I feel that I cannot refuse this duty, so I have decided to go north immediately. However, the scale of this disaster is unprecedented and cannot be alleviated with a small amount of relief funds and supplies. I respectfully ask all the elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts and uncles of the country to have compassion for the hungry and drowning, and generously donate. Donate one more yuan, and you can save one more life. Save one day earlier, and you can preserve one more point of vitality. I, Ying Guang, vow to purely use the nature of charity and humanitarianism to perform this arduous task for all the great philanthropists, to save our disaster victims. I sincerely bid farewell and beg you nine times over!"</p>

<p>Unemployed Marine Engineers</p>
<h3>Petitioned the Maritime Affairs Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Marine Engineer and Driver Association recently learned that the Ministry of Communications stipulated that only those with nautical knowledge and experience are allowed to serve as marine engineers on ships, and that the ministry will issue qualified employment certificates. However, in order to save costs, shipping companies have replaced certified engineers with people who have no knowledge at all, resulting in as many as 100 unemployed engineers. Yesterday, unemployed marine engineers sent more than 20 representatives, including Li Ronghua, Mao Jinquan, Zhou Yeyuan, Wang Shiyong, and Xu Wencai, to the Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to petition for the elimination of unqualified marine engineers to maintain the livelihood of workers. Yu Boming, the section chief of the second section of the bureau, received them and promised to start handling the matter within one month, eliminating unqualified marine engineers. He also stated that if the company continues to use unqualified engineers who have not been inspected, the bureau will refuse to inspect them. According to the workers, if the elimination is not carried out after one month, they will petition the Ministry of Communications again.</p>

<h3>Promoting Insurance for Chinese Merchants in All Industries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association received a letter from the Shanghai General Office of Insurance for All Industries requesting the promotion of Chinese merchant insurance. Yesterday, it sent a special letter to its district branches, stating:</p>
<p>"Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>The association has received a letter from the Shanghai General Office of Insurance for All Industries requesting the promotion of Chinese merchant insurance. After investigation, it is undeniable that those who have historically purchased insurance have focused on foreign merchants, resulting in the outflow of benefits and rights. Now that the office has taken the promotion of Chinese merchant insurance as its mission, it is also a way to recover benefits and rights, and should be vigorously promoted to achieve mutual assistance. Therefore, we hereby inform you to investigate and pray that you will inform all members that in the future, if there are insurance matters, please contact the office as much as possible.</p>
<p>Local Association Investigates Charitable Organizations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association yesterday sent a letter to the local charitable organizations in this city, stating:</p>
<p>"Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association sent a letter stating that the association aims to seek the welfare of citizens and improve local undertakings. Since its establishment, it has been eager to understand the trends of local undertakings in order to provide research materials. Therefore, it has established a statistics committee to compile Shanghai statistics, including charitable undertakings. Your association is the joint organization of Shanghai charitable organizations and must have detailed records of various charitable undertakings in this city. We are sending you a questionnaire and respectfully hope that you will fill it in in detail. In addition, if there are printed materials that can be used as a reference for compiling statistics, please also give them as a gift. After investigating the various undertakings run by the charitable organizations of our association, the results are quite remarkable. If we compile statistics, it will also arouse the interest of people in the community. Therefore, we are sending two copies of the original form and hope that you will investigate and fill them in separately and send them to our association within ten days for collection and transmission. If there are printed materials that can be used for reference, please also send two copies as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association Solicits Donations</h3>

As of February 20 this year, it has collected a total of 14,138.18 yuan and 5 jiao in small coins.

<h3>Original Verdict Upheld in Indian Police Murder Case</h3>
<p>Two Indian Police Officers in Hankou File Another Appeal</p>
<p>In the case of Indian police officer You Sha, who blocked Hong Kaifa, a tenant of the third room, from moving out and stabbed Zhou Ayu to death in Li Zhongli, the defendant refused to accept the ten-year prison sentence imposed by the first-level court and appealed to the British Assize Court. The appeals court ruled the day before yesterday to uphold the original verdict. However, considering that You Sha was young, it was conditionally permitted that if he behaved well in prison and repented, he could petition the British Minister to China for a reduction in his sentence.</p>
<p>At the same time, two Indian gatekeepers in Hankou, due to religious disputes, gathered eight people to fight in the streets of Hankou. The court sentenced them to one year in prison and ordered them to be deported after their release. They also appealed against the deportation order, requesting reconsideration, claiming that the defendants had sold all their property in India and brought their families to China. Now, in China, they may still have outstanding loans that have not been recovered. The deportation for a minor fight may lead to their bankruptcy. This case was also heard in the British Assize Court the day before yesterday.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Industrial Bank Shareholders' Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Industrial Bank has been operating quite well since its establishment in October two years ago. On the 19th of this month, a regular shareholders' meeting was held in the bank. A total of 148 shareholders attended, which was sufficient for a quorum. The meeting was called to order and Wu Zhihao was elected chairman. He reported on the business situation of the bank and its branches, stating that when the bank was established two years ago, it coincided with the January 28 Incident in Shanghai. For the sake of prudence with the shareholders' capital, the directors of the bank only chose to make secure loans. As a result, the bank did not suffer any losses. When the situation stabilized, the bank officially opened on June 4 last year. However, it still adhered to the principle of stability, so it has achieved considerable results since its opening, which is gratifying. The bank's settlement account for last year has been audited and certified by Xu Yongzuo, a famous Shanghai accountant, and has been sent to the supervisors for review and stamping. A separate account statement has now been prepared and submitted to the shareholders for their perusal. Subsequently, Supervisor Lin Kanghou reported, stating that the business situation of the bank has been reported in detail by the chairman, which should be understood. The bank's accounts have been audited by accountant Xu Yongzuo and have been reviewed and stamped by this supervisor. There are no errors, so please rest assured. After the reports were completed, the settlement for the 21st year was approved on the spot, and three supervisors were re-elected. The results of the ballot were that Lin Kanghou, He Shaoyu, and Guo Yonglan were re-elected. The meeting adjourned when the bell rang six times.</p>

<h3>February Health Report</h3>
<p>The February report of the Health Officer of the Public Works Department stated:</p>
<p>The mortality rate for foreigners this month was 14.21, compared to 13.07 last month. The increase was due to more deaths from tuberculosis and pneumonia. The mortality rate for Chinese was 16.99, compared to 14.79 last month. The increase was mainly due to the discovery of more deaths on the road.</p>
<p>The birth statistics showed that 32 birth reports were received for foreigners this month, and 153 for Chinese, of which only 114 were living within the boundary. This statistic cannot be improved until hospitals and midwives are fully registered.</p>
<p>This month, 10,009 people were vaccinated against smallpox, of which 7,323 were handled by the injection car and 2,686 by the district health centers.</p>
<p>The number of influenza cases has increased recently. Generally speaking, although the severity of this disease varies from person to person, the danger is that it may cause pneumonia, which can be life-threatening. Moreover, those who suffer from this flu often feel unwell for weeks or months. Therefore, those who suffer from it should not treat it as the same as a common cold.</p>
<p>The pathological research laboratory conducted 1,577 tests this month. The rabies treatment room had 39 consultations, of which two came from other cities.</p>
<p>The average daily milk production was 26,170 pounds. The number of inspections was higher than usual, as a new factory opened and another factory resumed operations after reorganization. Buffalo milk and local cow's milk were also inspected and analyzed several times, and the results were satisfactory. Twenty-seven sick cows were found and removed, and compensation of approximately 378 yuan was paid.</p>
<p>Business at the small vegetable markets was slightly worse after the Lunar New Year, but it has recovered in the middle of this month. The weights and measures used by the vendors were checked and compared as usual. Only one case of violation was found and prosecuted.</p>
<p>The cleaning department of the Health Department was as busy as usual with vaccinations and investigations of infectious diseases. Inspections of schools and factories were carried out as usual. The cleaning of outdoor swimming pools has also begun.</p>
<p>Miyun County, Hebei Province</p>
<h3>Temporary Women and Children Relief Society Established</h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the Temporary Women and Children Relief Society has been formally established in Miyun County, Hebei Province. Zhang Jinghe, a priest of the local Catholic Church, was elected as the president by the local residents, and Wang Youan, the assistant manager of Tianxing Gold Mine, was elected as the vice president to handle the reception of women and children. The letter from the Relief Society requesting assistance from all parties is listed below:</p>
<p>"Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>Due to the outbreak of the war in Rehe, the people have lost their homes and jobs, have no place to live, and have no way to go. It is difficult to count the number of people who have died from freezing and starvation. The large army along the way has passed through the area frequently, and the people have fled. Nine out of ten houses are empty. When our colleagues witnessed this chaotic situation, they were angry and heartbroken. Therefore, we initiated the organization of the Women and Children Relief Society, which has been open for more than ten days. We have already taken in more than 400 women and children. If this continues, the number of people will inevitably increase. At present, we are running out of resources, but we cannot bear to stop. It is difficult to sustain this situation. We have long heard that your organization is compassionate and can help those in distress. If you can generously provide assistance to save the victims, our association and the women and children we have taken in will be grateful for your great kindness."</p>
<h3>The End of the Butterfly and Snow Affair</h3>
<p>| Lin Xuehuai Has Repaid His Debts |</p>
<p>The Butterfly and Snow Affair, which caused a sensation for a time, has been going on for three years. The part of Hu Die's request to dissolve the marriage contract with Lin Xuehuai has been finalized after three trials. As for the part requiring Lin Xuehuai to return the debt, the original amount was more than 4,000 yuan, but the court ruled that he should repay more than 600 yuan. Lin has not fulfilled this obligation for a long time. Recently, Hu Die's attorney, Zhan Jifeng, filed a petition with the First Special District Local Court for prompt enforcement. On the day of the hearing, Lin Xuehuai was operating a photography business in Suzhou and did not know about the case, so he did not appear in court. The execution judge then approved the plaintiff's request and waited for the document to send the police to Suzhou with the plaintiff to identify and arrest him. After the newspaper reported this, Lin finally learned of the matter and quickly returned to Shanghai to settle the debt. The arrest will not happen, and the marriage drama will come to an end from now on.</p>
<h3>Pitiful Unemployed Man Kills Himself</h3>
<p>A man with improper clothing came to the Tangshan New Hotel at 342 Tangshan Road at 12 o'clock late the day before yesterday and booked a room. He wrote his name Chen Ziying, from Ningbo, 28 years old, in the circulation book. Later, he secretly took opium and committed suicide. At about 8 a.m. the next morning, Zhang Hequan, the tea servant, was cleaning the room next door and heard the man moaning constantly, so he knew something was wrong. He immediately went to inspect and saw that he could not speak, was foaming at the mouth, and saw an opium box and other items on the table. The tea servant immediately reported to the accountant, who reported to the Huishan police station and ordered Chinese detective Bao Desen to investigate. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly afterwards. A suicide note was found by his side, which stated: "I am a poor man who is unemployed and homeless. I hope the authorities will report the body for collection." The detective then took the body to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, he reported to the First Special District Local Court and appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to inspect the body. After taking the seat, Mr. Guo ruled that the deceased Chen Ziying had died of opium poisoning. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for collection.</p>

<h3>Travel Around the World, Passing Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>Driving a British Austin Seven Car</p>
<p>On October 20th of last year, German automobile mechanic Mr. Blanc and his wife, Ms. Dono, set off on a grand journey around the world in a new British-made Austin Seven car. They traveled smoothly through Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and reached Arabia. They then traversed the 600-mile desert region between Damascus and Baghdad, with sandstorms obscuring their vision, and the car windows had to remain closed. Upon reaching Persia, the roads deteriorated further, but fortunately, they did not encounter any bandits along the way. They arrived in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, which is one of the hottest places in the world. The city is modern, but few Europeans visit. After arriving in Calcutta, they rested for ten days, then took a boat to Rangoon, reaching Penang. They continued by car to Singapore, then by boat to Saigon. They disembarked and traveled to Haiphong, intending to travel overland through China and Nanning in Guangxi, but were hindered by heavy rain. They returned to Annam and took a boat to Hong Kong. They then boarded the President Cleveland and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 20th). Accompanied by Mr. Cruz, General Manager of the Shanghai Ford Motor Company, Mr. Bowen, General Manager of the American Tong Motor Company, and Mr. Lin Zhenbin, General Manager of the Huashang Advertising Company, they toured Shanghai for a week. Yesterday, they took the same ship to Japan. They will also travel to the United States and then return to their country via England. Mr. and Mrs. Blanc highly praised the performance of the Austin Seven car, stating that they had traveled over 12,000 miles without any need for repairs.</p>
<p>The Thirteen-Year-Old</p>
<h3>Missing Girl Incident</h3>
<p>丨Abducted and Sold to Fujian by Maternal Uncle in Collusion with Three Women丨</p>
<p>Gui Bao, the thirteen-year-old daughter of Mrs. Wang Le, a Ningbo native residing at No. 46 Zhaofeng Road, is a beautiful and charming girl. She was studying at the Muyi School of the Methodist Church on Huilu, attending evening classes for two hours. On December 21st of last year, at around 8 pm, she went to school but did not return. Mrs. Wang went to the school to investigate and was told that a man in his thirties, with a large face and nose, wearing a blue cloth short-sleeved shirt and trousers, had taken her away. Mrs. Wang did not recognize this person and searched everywhere, but to no avail. According to intelligence reports, the police searched for the abductor without success. Mrs. Wang wept day and night, but could not find any clues. Recently, Mrs. Zhang Le, a relative from Ningbo, came to Shanghai and learned that the girl Le Guibao had been abducted by her maternal uncle, Le Wenxing, in collusion with Ningbo women Gong Li (also known as A'er), Chai Lu (also known as A'yu), and Li Liu (also known as A'mao Niang), residing at No. 147 Aierkaoke Road, Dongyouheng Road, No. 38 Yuqing Lane, and No. 8 Lishou Lane, and sold to a wealthy man named Zhang in Nancang, Xinghua County, Fujian Province. They received 300 yuan, which they divided and spent. Mrs. Wang secretly reported this to the Huishan Concession Police the day before yesterday. Detective Li Hongsheng was dispatched and arrested the three women at their addresses, taking them back to the police station and transferring them to the women's prison for temporary detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the events in detail and requested a postponement. After Mrs. Wang Le provided her testimony, Judge Wu Zehan questioned the defendants briefly and ordered them to remain in custody, with a rescheduled hearing date to be determined.</p>
<p>A Peiping Woman</p>
<h3>Demands 60,000 Yuan in Damages</h3>
<p>Filing a Criminal Complaint, Shandong Native Song Lizhai is Required to Compensate for Emotional and Material Losses</p>
<p>Li Xiangru, a 23-year-old woman from Peiping, is of sound physique and fashionable attire and is skilled in Peking opera. In the winter of the previous year, she met Song Lizhai, a native of Shandong, at a social gathering. They began living together at No. 30 Yonganfang, Yongan Street, in the French Concession, and later moved to No. 68 Siming Lane, Xiahfei Road. Song, however, was already married. His attitude towards Li was solely based on money. Recently, Li ran out of money and was unable to provide for Song's extravagant spending, so he abandoned her. Li, believing that Song had committed an act violating Article 244 of the Criminal Code, hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court, along with a civil suit, demanding 60,000 yuan in compensation for emotional and material losses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefei opened the Third Criminal Court for the hearing. The defendant was absent. His lawyer appeared in court and stated that the defendant had gone to the capital on business and would be able to arrive in Shanghai in three or four days. He requested that the court grant a postponement. Judge Xiao granted the defendant's lawyer's request, rescheduling the hearing for the 25th and informing them that if the defendant failed to appear at the next hearing, the court would issue a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>The Press Association</p>
<h3>Replies to Letter from Members Gu Zhian and Others</h3>
<p>Explaining Misunderstandings in the Letter, Statement Also Made by Chairman of the General Assembly</p>
<p>The Shanghai News Reporters Association replied yesterday to a letter from members Gu Zhian and thirty others. In addition,</p>
<p>A letter from Gu Zhian and twelve others to the Association was also issued, with a statement included below.</p>
<p>Reply from the Press Association: Gentlemen, we received your letter expressing doubts about the recent election and requesting to withdraw from the Association. After reading it repeatedly, we are deeply saddened. The Association was originally formed through the reorganization of the Shanghai News Reporters Federation. At that time, due to the dismissal of staff by the Shishi Xinbao without justifiable reason, we sought to obtain a legal basis for the organization itself, in order to consolidate its internal unity and improve the soundness of its organization. Hence, the decision to reorganize was made. After legitimate preparation, it was legitimately established. Fortunately, the total number of members reached 199. This is the largest number of members for a reporters' organization in the city since its establishment. If all members work together, we might be able to achieve even a tenth of our organizational goals. Unfortunately, misunderstandings arose at the recent meeting, which all members deeply regret. Thirty members of the Association, out of a total of 199, have requested to withdraw. In the Association's records, this is undoubtedly a significant loss. We sincerely hope that these thirty members, after understanding the facts, will be able to dispel their misunderstandings and restore their original membership numbers, and work together to advance the Association's affairs. This is why the Association is calmly and rationally willing to explain the matter to the thirty members. The letter from the thirty members to the Association is divided into four parts, but their only argument is that a list was discovered at the meeting, which they believe indicates electoral fraud. The letter from Mr. Huang Tianpeng and eight other members states that "this method seems close to monopolization." The letter from Mr. Gu Zhian and twelve other members states that "beforehand, there were rumors that one or two unscrupulous individuals were controlling the election." Saying "seems close to monopolization" and "rumors of manipulation," using terms of suspicion and hearsay, in correspondence and newspapers, those unfamiliar with the situation may believe that the Association's election had some kind of scandal and that the elected committee members were of low character. The members lightly used harsh words in their letters, fearing they were not exhaustive enough, leaving no room for the group of 199 members to work together, leaving no room for the character and reputation of all reporters in Shanghai, causing those who care about the Association to grieve, those who hate the Association to rejoice, and those who the Association has previously criticized to snicker. The consequences are not what the members initially anticipated. Furthermore, in terms of facts, how can the discovery of a list at the election meeting immediately be deemed as fraud? At the time, representatives from the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau were present to provide guidance and clearly indicated that the list did not hinder the election process. The presidium also put to a vote whether or not to announce the list, and the majority of members indicated that they did not want it announced. Since the list was not announced, how could the members present know the names on the list? Even if the electors wanted to avoid the names on the list, how could they do so? The members who are now requesting to withdraw were mostly those who participated in the election. If they believed that the discovery of the list constituted fraud, how could they have continued to vote and elect as usual? And perhaps some of the members' ballots also included votes for people on the list. Can these members also admit to colluding in fraud or being manipulated? Since the members made no statements at the time, and only spoke of election fraud after the names of the elected officials were announced, the Association can understand that the members' actions, although lacking in restraint, may not have had malicious intent. However, outsiders will surely believe that the members themselves were not elected and are therefore making these slanderous statements and destructive actions. Can the members endure this? The members also stated that one or two unscrupulous individuals were controlling the election. Even if there were one or two unscrupulous individuals, their guilt only extends to those one or two individuals. To implicate the entire committee, let alone the Reporters Association, let alone the character of reporters, as if all but the thirty members of the 199 members were people who did not know how to cherish themselves and willingly accepted humiliation, is it not that the members think too highly of themselves and too lowly of others? Furthermore, even if, as the members pointed out, there were indeed abuses in the election and it was manipulated by one or two individuals, then the members could use their membership rights to denounce and punish the crimes of those one or two individuals. But instead, they resorted to the passive measure of withdrawing from the Association. After withdrawing, they lose their qualifications and can no longer advocate for Association affairs, tolerating the Association's affairs and the reputation of reporters being sold out and destroyed by one or two unscrupulous individuals. Are the members more concerned with the one or two unscrupulous individuals than with the entire membership? In short, a list, one or two unscrupulous individuals, based on the members' thinking, seem to believe that the Reporters Association should be sacrificed. Then how can they face the other 169 members? And how can they face the Party and government representatives who were legally present to provide guidance? The members should think about this carefully. An organization is a public entity, and only the public will should be followed. The committee members, having been legitimately elected, have legal and moral responsibilities to the members. In addition to notifying the elected committee members to assume office on time, the Association specifically explains the misunderstandings and presents a full reply. Facts are the ultimate rhetoric, and prejudice disappears after careful examination. Then the members will surely have a thorough understanding one day, and the Association also hopes to have the opportunity to work for the members again, as it did when it worked hard to resolve the dismissal crisis at the Shishi Xinbao. We have said all that we need to say. We hope you will reconsider it. We wish you all the best. The Shanghai News Reporters Association.</p>
<p>Statement of the Presidium: We read in the Shishi News on the 21st that Mr. Gu Zhian and twelve other members of the Association</p>
<p>sent a letter to the Association, in which it stated that the presidium even stated that some members of the presidium had participated in refusing to accept [the list] beforehand. Upon investigation, at the general meeting held at the Youth Association in Baxianqiao on the 18th of this month, a vote was taken on the incident of someone finding a list, and it was decided not to announce it. As for Chairman Yan Esheng saying that if the original finder believed it necessary to pursue the matter, then the list would be the only evidence and should be kept by themselves and handled according to the law, the presidium was not in a position to accept it. Would there not be a risk of the list being destroyed if someone on the presidium had participated in the matter? There was no affirmative tone of someone on the presidium participating beforehand. This is a matter of common sight and hearing. How can the meaning of the words be deliberately altered, deviating from the truth? In addition to directly writing to the members, we are afraid of confusing the hearing, so we hereby declare this for public review. Respectfully submitted by Yan Duhe, Zhao Junhao, Hang Shijun, Yan Esheng, Qu Shao Yi.</p>

<h3>Contributions to the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Hoping to Enlist Famous Artists from Across the Country so that Everyone Can Apply</p>
<p>Wang Yiting and others sent a letter to the "Call for Submissions to the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition," stating: Gentlemen, we recently received your letter calling for submissions to the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition. We are grateful for your consideration, even though we are just mediocre talents and are not worthy of the honor. We have heard that the method of soliciting submissions for this exhibition is that the committee members of your association, with a spirit of great impartiality, widely solicit works from famous artists. This is like a coral iron net, without regretting any talent being missed. However, based on our observations, we dare not be secretive and offer some humble suggestions, hoping you will adopt them. We have heard that for this call for submissions, your association has internally set a limit of only about 100 people. However, within the country, there is no lack of diligent artists with exquisite works, both in major cities and secluded areas. It is definitely not limited to the 100 people we have seen and heard of. Taking the Chinese Painting Association, which we founded, as an example, the members number more than 190. Among them, there are many with refined painting skills and superb artistry, which we cannot hope to match. However, they are not on the list of solicited artists. We are merely service personnel of this association, yet our names are mentioned and recognized, not because we have specialized skills in practical learning. If we were to simply decline, we would not be able to face the members of our association. If we were to avoid submitting, we would not be able to face your association's intention to widely solicit submissions. We are truly in a dilemma. Moreover, this is not just about our association. From a small perspective to a large one, taking the Chinese Painting Association as an example, more than a dozen members have already been solicited. Multiplying this by ten, it is not a small number. However, among the members of our association, more than 180 have talents superior to ours but harbor regret at not being selected. Based on this, how many talents are missed across the country? Missing the talents of the Chinese Painting Association is a small matter, but missing the talents of the world is a big matter. In our humble opinion, this is absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, to avoid this drawback, the only way is to completely cancel the predetermined list and create new regulations, openly soliciting submissions and strictly reviewing and selecting, so that everyone in the world can apply and have no regrets at not being selected. Your association takes talent with great impartiality and does not accept mediocre pieces. After all, the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition is an international platform, not a private exhibition. How can the eyes and ears of a dozen committee members and the works of a hundred people be said to represent the art of the entire country? If you adopt our humble suggestions and do not hesitate to ask questions, we are extremely willing to exhaust our knowledge and offer our contributions. If you consider our arguments to be wrong, then we would rather remain reclusive and hidden, and not be guilty of failing the art of the entire country. We humbly submit our sincere feelings for your public consideration. Respectfully addressed to the Preparatory Committee of the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition. Wang Yiting, Chen Xiaodie, He Tianjian, Wu Zhongxiong, Wang Aishi, Xie Gongzhan, Sun Xueni, Zhang Shengzhuang, Zhang Yuguang, Zheng Wuchang, Qian Shoutie, together send their regards.</p>
<p>National Art Exhibition</p>
<h3>Actively Preparing for the Lottery</h3>
<p>Remaining Donations Exceed 4,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Relief Association Allocates Aid to the Righteous Army</p>
<p>The National Art Exhibition, jointly organized by the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, the Republic of China National Salvation Organizations United Association, and the Chinese Painting Society, was previously held at the Lake Society and the Ningbo Native Place Association for a total of nine days. It has now concluded. The total revenue from both modern and antique works, as well as ticket sales, special issue catalogs, and donations from entertainment activities, amounted to 8,743.237 yuan. The expenses for preparatory meetings and costs amounted to 4,525 yuan, leaving a net income of 4,217.60 yuan. According to Mr. Hu Zusun, the executive director of the association, this income was originally entrusted by the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association to designated personnel to deposit in banks and allocate to the righteous army. The association itself did not receive the funds. Currently, the association is in the process of transferring the matter to the Supervisory Committee of the Relief Association for review, so that a special booklet can be published for public information and to enhance credibility. Meanwhile, the remaining works are being sorted, renumbered, and active preparations are underway for a lottery ticket sale. Mr. Hu also stated that the remaining works still number over 2,000 pieces, with many valuable works, valued at over 20,000 yuan. If 3,000 tickets can be sold at a minimum of five yuan each, it will generate 15,000 yuan. Recently, donations of works are still abundant. For example, Wang Yuwen donated two framed landscape paintings, and Wang Ming, a nine-year-old prodigy from Shanghai, also donated a couplet.</p>

<h3>The Nanyang Tobacco Factory Dispute Continues</h3>
<p>The Company Responds to the Conditions Yesterday</p>
<p>The Workers Petition the Party and Government</p>
<p>Following the strike at the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company in Hongkou, Wu Shiyuan, the arrested union officer, and worker Li A Jin were transferred to court yesterday. The company has formally responded to the conditions raised. The workers have sent representatives to petition the party and government agencies. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Workers Sent to Court: After the dispute occurred, a worker named Zhang Desheng was arrested on the spot by the Hongkou Patrol Room and sent to court for trial the day before yesterday. At that time, union officer Wu Shiyuan was in the gallery next to the court and was subsequently arrested by detectives. In addition, a worker named Li A Jin was arrested in the factory. Yesterday morning, the Hongkou Patrol Room transferred them to the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Zehan interrogated them. Nanyang Company sent legal counsel Wu Linkun to court to state the case, while the patrol room's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated in court that the case was originally handled by Judge Xiao, and therefore requested a postponement to the 28th for a joint trial. The judge approved the request and ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Yu, fourteen years old, a girl Lin Mei, eighteen years old, and Zhong Yu's thirteen-year-old fiancee Xing Xian, have lived together at home since childhood (that is, a child bride and a cousin of Zhong Yu). After graduating from elementary school, Zhong Yu was introduced to a mounting and painting shop called Jiu Yi Tang at the Wangjia Pier in Nanshi last spring as an apprentice. Last autumn, he suddenly fell ill with lung disease and returned home. Medication was ineffective, and he died in the middle of the night on the fourteenth day of the first lunar month this year, 42 days ago. The next day, his family prepared a coffin and embalmed the body, and temporarily parked it on the bank in front of the Pan family's house in Hebei Town. Unexpectedly, at about 8 o'clock the night before last, Xing Xian was lying on the bed, repeatedly calling "Bitter mother, bitter mother, the child has been resurrected!" Upon hearing this, the Qiu family felt that the voice sounded like Zhong Yu's, so she rushed to the floating coffin, removed the straw, and wanted to see the face of the dead person. However, some good people took rumour-mongering as their ability. The coffin shook, there were voices inside the coffin, and the coffin lid still had residual temperature, etc., and the ghost stories were so vivid. The foolish people did not realize it and regarded it as a fact. They also said that the yang energy was heavy during the day, and they planned to open the coffin at 8 o'clock in the evening. As a result, it spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred. In an instant, two to three thousand people gathered. Those who like to gamble and play Huahui in Shanghai took cars to worship, running on the Shanghai-Min Road, endlessly. The head of the Third Precinct of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Liu Lun, learned of the previous situation, and was deeply afraid of undermining public order. So he sent Inspector Yuan Desheng, together with the head of the security team of the district, Ding Qingzhong, to lead the team police to suppress it. He carefully observed the girl Qiu Xingxian, her eyes were motionless, her eyebrows were upside down, and the strangest thing was that she could make a sound from her throat without moving her mouth, but it was not clear, as if she was suffering from nervous symptoms. He immediately ordered Pei Su to send Xing Xian to Shanghai for treatment. On one side, the floating coffin of the deceased was ordered to be moved to the border of Songjiang County, Henan Province for temporary placement. The sensational resurrection of the dead person was finally calmed down.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Club Case</h3>
<p>Jiang Boxian, who lives in Xingjuli, Nanhui Pavilion Road, and makes a living selling fancy clothes, once lost his job, so he formed a rotating credit society to raise capital. Among his members were Zhou Ronggui, who runs the Zhou Wansheng noodle shop, and his widowed sister-in-law, each with one share. Unexpectedly, in June or July of last year, Zhou's sister-in-law won a share and remarried. Jiang Boxian was unable to bear the responsibility, so he negotiated with Zhou Ronggui. Zhou agreed that there was still a small share, and they would calculate again. If the small share was won, he would find another guarantor. By the end of last year, Zhou needed money urgently, so he won the share. Jiang urged him to fulfill his promise, but Zhou refused. In the evening, he gathered people to go to Jiang's house with weapons and coerced Jiang's wife, Jiang Wu, saw him turn around at the door, and ran outside to report to policeman Liu Lindong, saying that there was a robbery at home. The policeman, without asking the reason, saw Zhou running out of the house and shot him, killing him with a shot to the head. The First Precinct of the First District took Liu Lindong, Jiang Boxian, Jiang Wu, etc., into custody and sent them to the local court. After the prosecutor investigated, he charged Liu Lindong with murder under Article 282 of the Criminal Law, and Jiang Boxian and Jiang Wu, etc., with false accusations. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian opened the court for trial. According to Liu Lindong, he shot Zhou Ronggui because Jiang Wu reported that there was a thief, I entered the door and Zhou Ronggui ran outside, in the darkness, his hand was raised, as if with a weapon, I told him to stop, so I shot upwards in self-defense, causing him to be hit in the head. Jiang Boxian was standing in the reception room, etc. Jiang Boxian said that after the deceased won the share, he asked him for a guarantor, but he had no guarantor three times. When I was having dinner, he brought two hooligans, pulled out their sleeves, and tried to rob me of my money. I quickly grabbed Zhou, but Zhou broke free and escaped. The police officer had already shot over. I did not report the police, nor did I go out. Please investigate. Jiang Wu said that she was washing clothes in the patio when those people came in to rob her, and their appearance was terrifying, so she went out to call the police. I don't know how the police officer shot Zhou Ronggui to death, etc. At this point, Chen, the lawyer hired by Jiang Boxian, said that Jiang Boxian did not report the police, nor did he go out, so he was not responsible for false accusations. He cannot be implicated because of the marital relationship. Now Jiang has a serious case of hemoptysis due to an old lung disease and requests to be released on bail for medical treatment. After the presiding judge reviewed the case, he ordered bail to be granted for further questioning and then ordered the case to be retried.</p>
<p>Murder Case Near the North Station</p>
<h3>Newspaper Vendor Killed with an Ax</h3>
<p>The deceased was specializing in the newspaper vending business on the two railway lines and the cause of the murder seemed to be related to a grudge.</p>
<p>At 6:15 AM yesterday, an unprecedented murder occurred at the entrance of Lane 9, Shanqing Lane, south of the North Railway Station. The deceased was Zhou Yiting, also known as Zhou Laowu, who specialized in selling newspapers from major local newspapers on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines. The identity of the murderer is currently unknown, as it was early morning, there were few pedestrians on the road, and the residents in the lane had not yet woken up. Therefore, although Zhou was killed, it is difficult to know who the murderer was and how many there were. According to the investigation, Zhou lived at No. P.190, Lane 5 in the same neighborhood, and had been in the newspaper business for two decades. He had been jointly selling major newspapers along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line with Cheng Yinsheng, Xia Chengliang, and others. Only two months ago, he resumed selling newspapers along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway line. Zhou usually got up at 4:00 AM every day and went to the North Station to handle newspaper distribution matters. Recently, because his nephew, Zhou Quan, was able to take over his work, he sometimes went out as late as 6:00 AM. At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhou went from his residence to the North Railway Station and was suddenly attacked by several thugs. Zhou was unable to defend himself and was violently hacked five times with an ax, causing him to fall to the ground. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, discarded the ax and fled. Zhou was seriously injured but still conscious. A certain old woman from the same neighborhood went out to get water and shouted for help, saying, "Old good woman, come and save me!" The old woman was shocked and saw Zhou lying in a pool of blood, with blood gushing from his forehead, covering the ground. She was greatly frightened and shouted, causing all the neighbors to wake up. They immediately tried to help him back to his home and reported the incident to the nearby police post. Subsequently, the Haining Road Patrol Room notified the Central Fire Brigade to dispatch an ambulance, accompanied by a Chinese policeman No. 1782 and Zhou's wife, Li, to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died at around 9:00 AM. A reporter from the China East News Agency visited the scene yesterday after the incident. According to nearby residents, the incident appeared to be a revenge killing. When the tragedy occurred, they heard shouts for help, but they thought it was a thief being caught and attacked, so they did not want to get up. It was not until they heard the old woman's shouts that they realized something was wrong and went out to investigate, only to find that Zhou had been killed. At that time, Zhou was still able to speak. He had five ax wounds, two on the left temple and three on the back of the head, all several inches deep, resulting in significant blood loss. The murderer's ax was taken away by the police for investigation. At 11:00 AM, Chinese and Western detectives from the patrol room returned to Zhou's residence to investigate everything in the hope of obtaining clues. Zhou was 51 years old and a native of Nanjing. His wife, Li, was 40 years old and a native of Ningbo. They had a son and a daughter, the older one, Gui Tang, 7 years old, and the younger one, Gui Fen, 6 years old. Both children were lively and innocent, and as charming as ever, unaware that their father had been hacked to death. Zhou's nephew, Zhou Quan, was at the North Station when the incident occurred and rushed back to his residence upon hearing the news. He said that it was difficult to predict whether the incident was a revenge killing. Zhou had celebrated his 50th birthday on December 6th of last year and held a banquet at his residence. Not long after, he died tragically. The Haining Road Patrol Room is making every effort to investigate this case.</p>
<p>Company Response: After the party and government representatives and the local labor union representatives negotiated with the factory on the six preconditions put forward by the factory workers, it was decided to formally respond yesterday morning. Yesterday, the company officially sent a letter to the trade union office, the original letter as follows: In response, I have read your letter and attached a copy of the preliminary conditions for labor and management, and I have heard them all. Our company has always complied with national laws and regulations, and for legal laws and regulations, and to seek benefits for workers, within the scope of possibility, we will do our best, which is our company's original intention. It can be stated to the general workers first. Although your firm's preparation organization was previously approved by the Shanghai Fourth District Cigarette Industry Trade Union to know on record, the organizational process of the responsible firm is still not clear. Please send a special letter to inform, please transcribe a copy of all the documents submitted for organizational approval, and hand over the original copy to be inspected, so as to understand the truth, and then reply for Hektor.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Party and Government: Yesterday afternoon, at 2:00 PM, the workers' representatives were appointed to petition the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau separately. Zhang Sheng and Wang Xianqing received them separately. First, the representatives stated that the factory had recently hired a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to guard the factory gates and refused trade union officers to enter the factory to work, and abused workers, which was intended to provoke disputes. They requested negotiations and assistance. The representatives of the party and government expressed their acceptance, and the petitioning workers withdrew.</p>
<h3>Storm in the City: Commotion at Changqiao</h3>
<p>Rumors Confuse the Public: Resurrection of the Dead, Police Bureau Interferes, Temporary Relocation</p>
<p>There is a Pei family in Changqiao Town, West Shanghai, whose son died more than a month ago. Now, there is a sudden rumor of resurrection, and ghost stories are rampant, causing a sensation. The details are recorded below: Changqiao Town, East of the Wujia Lane Station on the Shanghai-Minnan-Zhejiang long-distance bus line, the brother of He Nanqiao, the current painting artist, the third brother Jiancheng, died nine years ago, leaving behind his sister-in-law, Qiu, who is now forty-three years old, and has three sons and one daughter, the eldest is Gen Yu, twenty years old, the second is Zhong Yu (the deceased), fifteen years old, and the youngest is Bu Qiang. As for Yu, who is fourteen years old, the girl Lin Mei, who is eighteen years old, and Zhong Yu's thirteen-year-old fiancee Xing Xian, have lived together at home since childhood (that is, a child bride and a cousin of Zhong Yu). After graduating from elementary school, Zhong Yu was introduced to a mounting and painting shop called Jiu Yi Tang at the Wangjia Pier in Nanshi last spring as an apprentice.

So he sent Inspector Yuan Desheng, together with the head of the security team of the district, Ding Qingzhong, to lead the team police to suppress it. He carefully observed the girl Qiu Xingxian, her eyes were motionless, her eyebrows were upside down, and the strangest thing was that she could make a sound from her throat without moving her mouth, but it was not clear, as if she was suffering from nervous symptoms. He immediately ordered Pei Su to send Xing Xian to Shanghai for treatment. On one side, the floating coffin of the deceased was ordered to be moved to the border of Songjiang County, Henan Province for temporary placement. The sensational resurrection of the dead person was finally calmed down.</p>
<h3>Qian Daochang's Miraculous Medicine Saves the World</h3>
<p>Qian Daochang, a Confucian doctor from Jiangyin, located at No. 1 Dingkang Lane, Triangle Field, Jisfeier Road, Caojiadu, has secretly manufactured more than ten kinds of miraculous medicines over the years, among which are particularly famous: Xiaor Dingjing Pills, Pain Relief Powder, Cholera Pills, Asthma Essence, Headache Powder, Qiufeng Pills, and Stop Diarrhea Water, etc. Since helping people, countless people have been saved. A while ago, wealthy businessmen Han and Ruan, etc., either suffered from asthma or phlegm, and they sought many famous doctors, but it was difficult to see results. After purchasing and taking Qian's miraculous medicine, in less than half a month, they completely eliminated the ten-year-old old ailment. Now, in order to popularize society, Qian has reduced the price of medicines, only charging costs, and the fixed price of each Dingjing pill is eighty cents, each bottle of Qiufeng pill is two yuan, each small bottle of Asthma Essence can be taken for ten days and costs five yuan, each box of Cholera pills is three yuan, each dose of Headache Powder is eight cents, and each bottle of Stop Diarrhea Water is two yuan.

<h3>The Future of Normal School Graduates</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Zhao Jiyu of this city丨</p>
<p>Speaking of the future prospects of normal school graduates, it is true that in the current Chinese society, they are generally looked down upon. However, we must also ask: Have the normal school graduates themselves fulfilled their due responsibilities? If they abandon their own responsibilities to seek a way out, there is no doubt that going east will be "This road is blocked," and going west will also be "This road is blocked." What are the responsibilities of normal school graduates? Let's look at how many out-of-school children there are in China today. Let's also see how many illiterate people there are. We know that these people and children have not found a way out; then, have the normal school graduates fulfilled their responsibilities? Asking ourselves honestly, if normal school graduates abandon their own responsibilities to seek other ways out, they will inevitably only find pain and frustration. It is true that everyone needs to eat, which is naturally a crucial issue. However, normal school graduates are laborers. They cannot enjoy a superior material life, and in reality, they do not enjoy it. Furthermore, they cannot rely on society to support them; they must be social producers and find a way out for society. Therefore, the responsibility of normal school graduates is to popularize production education for society. However, in today's Chinese society, this path is full of thorns. Therefore, normal school graduates must have the determination to create, the courage to pioneer, and the perseverance and hard work to overcome all obstacles. If normal school graduates take on the mission of "finding a way out for society," then they themselves will have a way out. I am also a normal school graduate, and I have been struggling in society for nearly ten years. I once wandered down another path. Regarding my recent life, it can be considered a good position, a primary school teacher earning thirty or forty yuan a month, which is quite good. However, I feel pain because I have abandoned the responsibilities of a normal school graduate, and I am just working as a hired laborer. Is this my way out? Is this the way out for us normal school graduates? As the saying goes, "We certainly cannot fight to fulfill the mission of the times on an empty stomach, but if you don't engage in this struggle, you will still go hungry." I am not going hungry now, but I want to do something, to work to find a way out for society, to be a producer for society. Therefore, I have decided to resign from my current teaching position in the second half of the year, 丨this is a school "making money for private individuals"丨 and I want to establish a school for popularizing production education. This is also to take on a bit more of the responsibility of a normal school graduate! What do you think of my idea? Can this path be taken? Mr. Yin Rixin, or other comrades, if you can jointly take on this responsibility of normal school graduates, I will naturally express my welcome twelvefold. I hope readers will sympathize with me, guide me, and help me.</p>
<p>Answer: Your ambition to resign from a school "making money for private individuals" and establish a school for popularizing production education is commendable. However, what exactly is a "school for popularizing production education"? To be honest, under the current political situation, it is "harder than ascending to heaven" for someone with nothing to establish a school for production education. Even if you勉strongly succeed, it will just be another school signboard on some road or lane in Shanghai, and another place to "make money" by deceiving people. This is not entirely due to the goodness or badness of people, but rather the social and political environment does not allow you to do otherwise. In my opinion, since you are going to be a laborer anyway, instead of being a word-chewing laborer in a school, you might as well go to a factory or company to be a physical or semi-physical laborer. In that environment, you may find opportunities to fulfill your obligations as a normal school graduate. As for your letter, you say "Normal school graduates are laborers" at the beginning, but then you say "I am just a hired laborer. Is this my way out? Is this the way out for us normal school graduates?" The words seem a bit contradictory. In fact, normal school graduates have no way out. If they really want a way out, the only way is for normal school graduates to consciously become laborers and fulfill their responsibilities as normal school graduates among the laborers.</p>

<p>Introduction to New Industries</p>
<h3>Mr. Kong Yongzhi's Impressions from Special Envoy Investigation</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>Mr. Kong Yongzhi was previously commissioned by the government to investigate industries in Europe and America. He spent half a year and recently returned to Shanghai. The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Management Association specially held a meeting to welcome him. During the meeting, Mr. Kong was asked to report on his impressions of the investigation. The following record is his lecture at the time. It has not been submitted to him for revision, so the reporter is still responsible for the text.</p>
<p>This time, being commissioned to investigate abroad happened to be during the autumn of the global economic panic, so it can be said to be fortunate and unfortunate. It is difficult to see the benefits of visiting when others cannot develop themselves. However, exploring the precedents of others and understanding the reasons for their failures cannot be said to be completely unproductive. This is like medical students who must go through difficult and complicated cases to increase their experience.</p>
<p>According to my personal findings, the reasons for the economic downturn in Europe can be divided into the following items:</p>
<p>(1) Mass Production: The United States vigorously pursued large-scale production, resulting in overproduction. Many products have become equal to waste. Now, the closed factories are unattended, and the social and economic impact of worker unemployment is significant. This is the biggest reason.</p>
<p>(2) Inability to Purchase: Because of the unemployment wave, the society's inability to purchase is certainly the biggest reason. However, the irrational consumption in the past is also the cause of the economic downturn. Previously, American workers could use installment payments, paying ten dollars to buy a car and five dollars to buy a piano. Such irrational consumption is also something we should be wary of.</p>
<p>(3) Speculative Business: Speculative business is very popular in the United States. A company can issue stocks at will, without certain restrictions. Later, stocks worth 500 dollars were only worth five dollars and no one wanted them. The government is responsible for this.</p>
<p>We have seen the situation of others. In the future, we can learn from the following five aspects:</p>
<p>(1) To prevent biological overproduction, in addition to paying attention to large-scale production, we should also pay attention to handicrafts. The government must also have precise statistics to prevent overproduction and control various industries.</p>
<p>(2) Demand that production and consumption are suitable and develop production industries separately according to consumer surveys.</p>
<p>(3) Prevent excessive speculative business. It is impossible to stop all speculative business during commercial competition, but it should be limited and cracked down on.</p>
<p>(4) Strive for labor-capital coordination. Germany has disputes due to labor-capital problems, which have affected political turmoil. Although China will not have any major disputes at present, it is still dangerous not to find ways to coordinate labor and capital and seek appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>(5) Revitalize agriculture and do not focus on industry. In the past, because China was based on agriculture, I advocated supporting the development of industry and commerce. Now, with new knowledge gained from the facts, I believe that without revitalizing agriculture, there is no way to support industry. Because without agriculture, industry has no raw materials, and farmers have no purchasing power. Therefore, revitalizing agriculture is an important vital element in supporting industry. Moreover, the majority of the Chinese population is farmers. If we want China to be peaceful, we must revitalize agriculture.</p>
<p>Interview Record</p>
<h3>A Conversation with Mr. Wu Yun Chu, Who Recently Returned from Europe and America</h3>
<p>— Qiacheng</p>
<p>"Why has 'Ajinomoto' disappeared from the market?"</p>
<p>This, of course, must be attributed to the invention of monosodium glutamate (MSG). The invention of domestic substitutes is much more effective than slogans and declarations boycotting foreign goods! Therefore, in this freezing weather, I still visited Mr. Wu Yun Chu, the inventor of MSG, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>After being led to the office, I met Mr. Wu, who had gray hair and a dusty face, and it was obvious that he had returned from Europe and America. There was no decoration in the room, and newly boxed goods were piled up outside. There were several guest lists and some planning books on the desk. There were also several male and female employees working in the room, but only the sound of machines from the neighboring room broke the silence here. What people care about most is naturally MSG, so the first sentence I asked directly was:</p>
<p>"Mr. Wu, can you talk to me about MSG?"</p>
<p>"Okay! But that's just a transitional business." It was also an unadorned answer.</p>
<p>"When did you start doing it?"</p>
<p>After some material examination, I found in a small booklet: "It was in 1922!" It was still a simple answer.</p>
<p>"What was the process like?"</p>
<p>"At first, I used chemical methods to analyze its ingredients from Japanese condiments, and then I used these ingredients to re-match and try it. At the beginning, the cost was very high and it was not suitable for commercial transactions. After three months, it was successful after several improvements."</p>
<p>"Does Mr. Wu operate other businesses besides Tianchu MSG now?"</p>
<p>"There are also Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant and Chi Chang New Company, which specializes in the raw materials for making matches."</p>
<p>Facing such an interviewee, I was really a little overwhelmed, but after my shifting exploration, his talkativeness could be elicited.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wu, what are your impressions after investigating in Europe and America?"</p>
<p>"I think our chemical industry should do basic work, but the interest is a little weaker. It seems not very cost-effective in terms of business. Fortunately, Tianchu has been strong recently, so I took on this responsibility myself. Regarding the work of manufacturing green gas, it has already started, and after the layout is in place, it can be started. At the same time, the work of light gas is also underway. I have also discussed with many experts abroad, and the plan has been successful. Because the war in the near future is a material war, the industrial sector must take into account national defense and make industrial military."</p>
<p>After saying that, he added a few more sentences: "This kind of business is based on obligation, not for the sake of rights. However, businessmen aim to make profits, so I have already made detailed budgets for this event before it started."</p>
<p>When talking about the impressions of the investigation, he told a lot about the situation of the international industrial sector recently. He still used simple and unadorned words from the low and slow sound belt to express it. When talking about China's future, Mr. Wu's opinion was:</p>
<p>"When I was abroad, I debated with many foreigners who despised China. I said, if China can work hard for ten years and everyone cooperate and divide the work, there is always great hope; but if we fight each other like this, it is hard to say."</p>
<p>When I was saying goodbye, he unexpectedly said to me:</p>
<p>"Please don't talk too much about MSG, because this is not considered an achievement, and I don't want to have excessive publicity." Because Mr. Wu has more valuable contributions (making acid and alkali). In the rattling of the machines, I walked out of the factory and threw myself back into the noisy downtown.</p>

<h3>Exhibition and Sale</h3>
<p>— Pan Yang An</p>
<p>A guest returned from visiting the exhibition of products from the Shanghai Products Association at the Zhizhi Expo and praised, "The preciousness of the products, the richness of the collection, and the beauty of the display are incomparable to the previous disorganization or deliberate shelving and non-display. However, speaking of the shortcomings, there are many treasures inside that are not for sale, and there is regret that people cannot buy them even if they want to. As for the China National Products Company, it gathers the essence of various factories, and strives to collect them without any effort, but there are still many daily necessities that have not been able to do everything that should be done." His words were very sincere. I responded by saying, "Your words are good, but you don't fully understand the purpose of it. Please let me finish what I have to say: The purpose of the exhibition is to promote people's attention, arouse people's feelings, and encourage manufacturers to improve their technology and induce buyers to love domestic products. Therefore, the display of its products should be fine rather than broad, and emphasize display rather than sales. Sometimes, using scientific methods, the order of products is listed for the reference of viewers. Sometimes, rare treasures are exhibited from a historical perspective to broaden the observation of viewers. Sometimes, with the means of foreign trade, we cater to the customs of foreigners to expand overseas sales. Sometimes, with international friendship, we specially make characters worshiped and loved by foreigners to make gifts of friendship. This is the true purpose of the exhibition. It is not originally a business principle, nor is it just to attract customers and attract customers. It contains an advertising effect only. Therefore, there are non-selling products and selling products in the exhibition venue, which can be freely chosen by the exhibitors without restrictions. However, in non-selling products, in addition to unparalleled antiques and rare treasures, categories can also be designated and specially customized. Even among the selling products, according to the exhibition method, they must be taken out after the end of the exhibition period. There are very few who sell them arbitrarily to disrupt the order of the venue. As for the China National Products Company, since it is not an exhibition in nature, everything displayed in the company is a selling product, and there is nothing that cannot be taken and delivered to the customer at any time. The display of its products emphasizes both fine and broad, beautiful and cheap. At the beginning of its operation, there was indeed the regret that the collection was not universal and the supply was not abundant. Recently, those in charge of it have realized this and have embraced the idea of opening up more doors. All fine and pure domestic products are included in the sales. Recently, it has also announced in the newspaper to solicit goods, aiming to gather famous products from various places and complete the needs of daily use, hoping that from a needle and a thread to a piece of paper, to fox fur, mink fur, mountain treasures, and seafood, customers can enter the door of the National Products Company, and everything they need to eat, what they lack to wear, and even daily necessities in their homes and necessities for travel are available to satisfy the wishes of customers and satiate the hearts of those who love to use domestic products. This is the ambition of the National Products Company. Bearing this mission and following the established goal, I hope that in the near future, every customer will be satisfied and happy, and have the joy of being at home. The guest heard my words, nodded and left, and used the above narration to inform the readers, and I would like to encourage the exhibition hall and the colleagues of the National Products Company."</p>

<h3>Suzhou's Promotion of National Products is Hot</h3>
<p>— Jia Hua</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai National Products community designated this year as the National Products Year and established the China National Products Company, Sanwu has taken the lead in the trend. Through the vigorous promotion of industrial and commercial leaders and local gentry, the National Products Movement in Suzhou has suddenly shown a lively image. Therefore, the information I heard is summarized as follows.</p>
<p>(Sudden Rise of National Products Market) The gentry and merchants of Suzhou had a plan to establish a National Products Market. After half a year of preparation, it coincided with the Japanese invasion of Shanghai. The situation was chaotic and people were panicking, so the progress was stopped. At the beginning of this year, under the urging of the National Products Promotion Committee of the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce, a meeting was convened again and the original site of the North Bureau Fire Brigade was surveyed and determined to be rebuilt into a market. As for the fire brigade, another nearby Lvqiufang Alley was found. All the relocation conditions were generally agreed upon. The authorized capital of the market is 120,000 yuan, which is entirely used for building houses. Two-thirds of it has been recognized by the initiators and various trade associations. The remaining one-third will be publicly solicited. Recently, due to the cost of preparation, the initiators have pre-funded 20,000 yuan to carry out the project quite actively. It is expected that construction will start after February. Roughly, a complete National Products Market can be established in the new city center of the North Bureau during the Lunar New Year to meet the needs of the people of Suzhou.</p>
<p>(Enthusiastic Broadcasting and Speeches) The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce has an organization of the National Products Promotion Committee. Those in charge of it are all industrial and commercial leaders of Sanwu. In the past, the work was quite restricted due to funding. This year, after Shanghai designated it as the National Products Year, the work suddenly became tense. Starting from the 18th of last month, a National Products broadcasting lecture was held at the Wu's Sarala Flower Hall Radio Station for 63 days. The speakers were all well-known people in Sanwu and National Products industrial and commercial leaders. The 5th of this month was the 16th day. Zhang Yipeng, a famous figure in the French Concession, gave a lecture. When talking about the situation of foreign goods dumping and economic aggression, he almost burst into tears. He also sang a song on the broadcasting station. The lyrics said. Speaking of promoting National Products.. It's hard for me to feel good.. The clothes are wool and cotton cloth.. The food is tobacco, alcohol, and candy.. The houses have windows.. The cars and railways run.. The four elements of life.. All rely on other people's help.. Plus guns, cannons, and military fire.. Spend money like dirt.. Flip through the customs account books.. Countless money flows out.. Everyone quickly wakes up.. Must rely on your own ability.. Quickly discard foreign goods.. Quickly protect rights.. Strictly block dumping policies.. Break economic aggression.. Don't be a five-minute fever.. Don't make a big mistake.. I am now talking with good intentions.. Save the tragedy of national subjugation..</p>
<p>(Preparation for Fashion Exhibition) Zhang Shoupeng, chairman of the National Products Promotion Committee, recently told reporters that the association's future work policy is: First, to awaken women with higher consumption, and second, to instill in innocent and lively children. This is the first step in promoting National Products. It is now planned to hold a grand fashion exhibition to awaken the attention of men and women to the characteristics of National Products, and to hold a county-wide speech contest for school-age children, so as to instill the true meaning and significance of promoting National Products into the minds of school-age children, so that they will not be confused by glamorous foreign goods when they grow up. However, the above two tasks are planned to be held during the summer vacation due to economic and time reasons, so that the clothing for the fashion exhibition can save some expenses, and the speech contest can be held without wasting studies. Although there is this proposal now, it has not yet been carried out. But no matter what, a meeting will be convened this month to put it forward for discussion and actively prepare for it.</p>
<h3>A National Match Company Worth Introducing</h3>
<p>— Hong Ni</p>
<p>As the saying goes, a single spark can start a prairie fire. Although matches are a small daily necessity, they are indirectly related to people's livelihoods. Don't look down on matches as a small matter of two or three copper coins a pack. Accumulating them, the number is quite considerable. Just in terms of match unified tax, the total national annual amount has reached millions of taels, and the import volume of foreign matches, according to customs statistics, is at least more than 20 million taels. The factories established in China to avoid import taxes are not included. Before the January 28th Incident, we could see Phoenix brand matches being sold everywhere in China, especially Shanghai, which was the general hub for the sales of Phoenix brand matches. Domestic matches were in danger of closing down due to the dumping of foreign goods and the squeezing of donations and taxes. Soon after the suicide of Krueger, known as the Match King, the Phoenix brand matches also gradually decreased in power in China due to this reason. The Great China Match Company of domestic matches, which came out of the Beautiful brand (that is, the famous cigarette brand), seized the opportunity to succeed the Phoenix brand and sell well in the country.</p>
<p>The Great China Match Company was founded in the autumn of 1930. It was a merger of Yingchang, Hongsheng, Zhonghua, and Yusheng Companies. General Manager Liu Hongsheng hired Dr. Lin Tianji of chemistry, selected domestic raw materials, and used the latest scientific methods to make medicated stem matches, such as the Beautiful, Golden Rooster, Insurance, and Five Bats brands of matches, which are no less than foreign matches. Manufacturing factories were set up in Shanghai, Hankou, Ganzhen, and Suzhou, using self-made stem pieces. The annual turnover reached several million. The capital has recently increased to more than three million. In our country, it can be regarded as the first. By analogy, we can know that even the smallest things cannot be spared by luck. I specially record it to introduce it to the readers.</p>

<h3>What Makes a Sound National Products Salesperson</h3>
<p>— Jin Song Tang</p>
<p>For the operation of all industries and businesses, in addition to the soundness of the internal organization and the excellence of the products, the handling of business affairs and the improvement of external sales are certainly also a major key. Salespeople bear the mission of entrusting the entire business of a company and have a close relationship with a company. It is conceivable that they should work hard to promote it. Now that imported goods are rampant and domestic products are declining, what should salespeople in the National Products business pay more attention to? Based on what I have seen, I would like to discuss it with you.</p>
<p>In the old days, in our country's old shops, those who were in charge of business affairs (commonly known as "street runners") were often the manager or shop assistant of a shop. Most of these people had no firm goals and no sufficient experience. As for the discerning eyes and the agile skills, let alone. So, day after day, year after year, they were content with the status quo and stagnated. There were many who went bankrupt due to slow turnover and those who stopped business due to bad debts. As for witnessing the influx of foreign goods, they only shouted and complained, but did not seek to resist the enemy. In recent years, industry and commerce have flourished and the level of social knowledge has increased. The general old-fashioned street runners have been eliminated. However, it is as rare as phoenix feathers to find a salesperson with a pure new idea and principle. I have served in the industrial and commercial sector for more than ten years. After examining the actual experience, I have accumulated the following points. I feel that National Products salespeople should have these indispensable conditions. I will list them one by one below. A. Dignified Attitude and Conduct Salespeople represent a company when dealing with outsiders. A stable attitude and clear speech will prevent the other party from having bad images and lead to contempt. Salespeople are responsible for activities, not as mechanical as the work of internal personnel. Therefore, there is more contact with society, and the adverse external environment and bad customs often cause salespeople to degenerate too much. They should have a clear mind and strong credibility, so as not to go with the flow and be despised by others. If one is unfavorable to oneself, the company will also suffer damage to its reputation.</p>
<p>B. Firm and Rich Will and Knowledge Since attitude and conduct need to be dignified, will and knowledge should also be sufficient. Salespeople should make decisive decisions and have a clear hierarchy in the process of external business contacts, cargo loading, and payment collection. Avoid perfunctory treatment and frequent misunderstandings. Other things, such as business habits and economic conditions, should be well-informed. If the will is firm, the foothold is stable, and if the knowledge is rich, you will not fall behind.</p>
<p>C. Flexible Eyes and Skills Attitude, conduct, will, and knowledge can already be dealt with, but without deep and sharp eyes and agile skills, it is also in vain. The people encountered by salespeople are from all over the country. They go in different directions, and their dialects are different, and their habits are different. Without clever activities and adapting to circumstances, how can we seek to promote products and generate transactions?</p>
<p>D. Value of Conversation and Observation In this time of rural collapse and financial depression, the position of industry and commerce is in a precarious state. In addition, inland merchants have insufficient intelligence and scattered organizations. The customer accounts of the industrial and commercial sector are like candles in the wind. Therefore, salespeople's conversations with customers have the value of careful attention. Whether the store is well-established and what the internal situation is, do not hesitate to speak and write it down for reference to the release of accounts. It is also a shortcut to credit investigation, and business operations will benefit greatly from this.</p>
<p>E. The Spirit of Endurance and Hard Work There is a need for scrutiny between the salesperson's responses and in the socializing, but the spirit of enduring and enduring hardship is also an essential element for salespeople. Even in the scorching sun, sweating like rain, and in the cold winter, with the wind blowing in the face, we should go every day and work hard, so as to avoid the separation of information and the weakening of feelings.</p>
<p>In this autumn of commercial warfare competition, success or failure depends entirely on planning and proper handling. Salespeople who can endure hardship, not mind the trouble of talking, and not be afraid of the cold, heat, wind, and rain, should be courteous in their responses, fluent and lively in their speech, solemn and sincere in their attitude, and clear and firm in their thinking, not corrupt, and not perfunctory. That is an element of success, and the future of National Products is deeply reliant on it.</p>
<h3>A Word to the Three Major Companies</h3>
<p>— Wan Gong</p>
<p>Shanghai is the central hub for imported goods. The department stores that gather the greatest variety of imports must surely be Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun, right? Their store signs and advertisements all prominently display the phrase "Dealing in Global Merchandise." Isn't this irrefutable proof that they promote imported goods? Seeing these signs, I couldn't help but gasp!</p>
<p>Promoting national goods is, of course, the responsibility of all citizens. But if merchants don't sell them, where are people supposed to buy them? True, they'll argue, "Because there are buyers, there will be sellers." However, the young masters and modern ladies who insist on foreign goods are ultimately a minority. Ordinary people don't inherently favor foreign goods over domestic ones. It's just that the marketplace is filled with foreign products, so they casually buy them. There are many people like this. There are also those who are enthusiastic about promoting national goods and want to use them but struggle to find them and lack the ability to distinguish between them. Isn't this the merchants' responsibility?</p>
<p>Therefore, when it comes to promoting national goods, merchants should be on the front lines, especially the famous major companies in Shanghai. While they can't be expected to stop selling foreign goods altogether, they should also consider the phrase "Promote Chinese Local Products" on their store signs. Their display windows should primarily showcase national goods, and unless customers specifically request foreign products, they should present domestic goods first. If these major companies all actively promoted national goods, I believe the impact would be significant. Finally, I hope that the three major companies will be inspired by their conscience and, like the China National Goods Company, implement national goods to save the country. I would gladly walk past your doors every day and offer a salute!</p>

<h3>Butterfly Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The longest-lived butterfly in the world is undoubtedly the Immortal Butterfly in the Imperial Ancestral Temple of old Beijing. Yellow in color and as large as a teacup, it is said to have lived since the Jiajing reign of the Ming dynasty, making it a long-lived butterfly of three or four hundred years. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing dynasty even wrote a poem about the Immortal Butterfly of the Imperial Ancestral Temple. Later, the Immortal Butterfly would occasionally appear, and books such as "Records of the Capital City" and "Hong Xue Yin Yuan" all document it.</p>
<p>The best-flying butterflies in the world come from two locations: one is the large white butterfly produced on the islands of the Baltic Sea, called "Cabbage White," which often forms long-distance traveling groups, flying to various European countries. When they pass by, they resemble scattered and enlarged snowflakes in the air. The other is the pink butterfly produced in central Africa, known as "Snow Maiden," whose flying ability is even more astonishing! They can fly across the Sahara Desert in the thousands and hundreds, and after circling in North Africa for several days, they still have the strength to continue flying north to the prosperous British Isles.</p>
<p>Recently, I read "Planting Hermitage Collection" by Li Zixin of Dantu, which records the chaos of the Taiping Rebellion. Jiangdu He Guiqing held troops in Changzhou, planning to recover lost territory. Suddenly, a large colorful butterfly flew to the governor's office. He thought it was an immortal envoy descending to earth, so he immediately set up an incense table, dressed in formal attire, and bowed to the butterfly, asking about the safety of the situation. Those who flattered He all said this was a sign of a triumphant return. Later, the main camp collapsed, and He abandoned his post and fled. At that time, the national law was still strict, and generals who lost battles could not escape punishment. Li Zixin has a "Butterfly Song" published in his collection, which includes the warning sentence: "The battle gates are wide open, flags unfurl, the envoy's crown and belt shine in the office, the three armies cheer, moving heaven and earth, the flower and bird envoy comes to Penglai... The envoy is always mindful of the military and the country, burning incense to ask the butterfly about gains and losses, only wishing to seek fragrance and be drunk, protecting the good spring scenery of Jiangnan..."</p>
<h3>Chronic and Acute</h3>
<p>— Xian Xian</p>
<p>丨Chronic is Still Better丨</p>
<p>In the past, two doctors with queues and tight sleeves argued, nearly cracking each other's heads open. One was a Confucian doctor from a seven-generation family, what society calls a Chinese doctor. The other was a recent graduate of a medical university in Europe. Although he was also a genuine, old-fashioned, and unadulterated Chinese, society called him a foreign doctor. The reason for their conflict was that the Chinese doctor said the foreign doctor didn't understand pulse diagnosis, and the foreign doctor said the Chinese doctor didn't know anatomy. You call me an abscess, I call you a bastard. Later, a busybody peacemaker came out to mediate, saying that Chinese medicine is relatively stable, and Western medicine is relatively quick. It's like crossing a mountain: Chinese medicine likes to walk on the constructed road, and Western medicine likes to take the shortcut through the thorny bushes. Each has its own strengths, and each takes its own path. Fortunately, they reach the same destination by different routes, so there's no need for the rich to be intolerant of the poor.</p>
<p>The above story seems like a joke, but it fully demonstrates the chronic nature of China and the acute nature of foreign countries. Recently, I have obtained many more examples of chronic and acute. Taking walking as an example, Chinese people always like to swagger on the cement, while foreigners are always in a hurry, as if their butts are on fire. In the past, we often saw Chinese people walking in front of foreigners being pushed aside by foreigners and rushing past. Now, this rude and insulting behavior is not often seen, perhaps because the level of Chinese people has increased or because foreigners have become more civilized. However, foreigners behind Chinese people still often overtake them. Similarly, when facing national crises, people always run and jump, while Chinese people prefer to move slowly to ensure stability and plan for all contingencies.</p>
<p>Someone said that foreigners are impatient and Chinese people are slow. According to you, China's demise will also be relatively slow. Is that correct? I said, perhaps there is some truth to it.</p>
<h3>Spring Has Arrived</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>丨Springtime Guangxi Youth丨</p>
<p>What I want to talk about here is the scene of young men and women in Ping Le, He County, Zhong Shan, Zhao Ping and other counties in Guangxi province during springtime. Although I dare not say that they can represent the entire province, I always feel that they can at least represent the majority.</p>
<p>Once spring arrives, they have a lot of free time. Whether rich or poor, they spend their time leisurely in the first and second months of the year. Therefore, on market days, there are always traces of their red and green figures. Sometimes they run to the foot of the mountain or the riverbank to sing "mountain songs." Men and women respond to each other, and it is said that some of those songs are extremely sad, even making them and their partners cry. But some are also extremely joyous. Imagine Guangxi, where the climate is mild. Once spring arrives, everywhere is a scene of faces and peach blossoms reflecting each other in rosy hues. Naturally, these young men and women also take advantage of their youth to burn the flames of love! Most of the songs are love songs. Unfortunately, I cannot remember those good songs, so I can only copy down the two that I can currently remember, which are not very good:</p>
<p>"Love, ah! (Note) Sit, just sit,</p>
<p>Sit on the hilltop and sing a song.</p>
<p>Brother sings a line, sister sings a line,</p>
<p>Everyone sings until the osmanthus blossoms."</p>
<p>(Note) Meaning "love."</p>
<p>"If you love a sister, love a tender girl,</p>
<p>If you love a brother, love a young man;</p>
<p>Older brother is like a money tree,</p>
<p>Younger sister is like an embroidered bed."</p>
<p>If the men and women sing very well together, then they will enjoy each other in mountain caves or secluded places, or the woman will follow the man to a thatched hut or empty house in the wilderness to enjoy each other, staying for several days perhaps. However, some are not out of the woman's willingness, often forced by the man. It is said that women always "pretend to lower their heads when they have intentions in their hearts."</p>
<h3>In Memory of the Painter Mr. Ma Mengrong</h3>
<p>— Xi Shen</p>
<p>The teaching tent of Fufeng raises dust. Looking at the remaining ink, it's still difficult to guess. Cutting open the belly to cure the illness is hard to cure the disease. Burning the body, Heaven also resents pure talent. Before the wine, only pearls and jade remain to the sons. (Ten days before hospitalization, we drank in the city and talked about drama.) The clouds and smoke before my eyes are like ashes. Sighing at the flute and reed, calling them the two wonders. Yao Hong sings alone, with lingering sorrow.</p>
<p>Mr. Mengrong's funeral. It happened that I was sick and unable to offer condolences. Yesterday, I passed by the Chicago Exposition Products Association and saw a painting left behind. I was moved and composed a poem. Remembering your younger brother, Gong Yu.</p>
<h3>Empress</h3>
<p>— Xu Benxi</p>
<p>Old uncles in the countryside, worried about the times and the chaos, admit that the true son of heaven has already been born. They believe that the future empress is only three years old and is herding cattle for others.</p>
<p>In fact, the emperor will ascend the throne sooner or later. Shanghai has launched a "xx empress" and then the Sino-Western joint empress election event. We should at least not deny that the emperor will be born in the near future. So, if the old uncles in the countryside could know that the empress has already ascended the throne, I think they would piously fast and bathe and come to Shanghai to kowtow three times and prostrate nine times to pay respects to the phoenix carriage.</p>
<p>Not only that, but with an empress, there will be a future emperor. At that time, with political unity, an edict will be issued to seek talents, and although the national crisis is severe, I'm afraid it won't call for a little brother to live and die, right? Then, the birth of the royal family should be the unique way to save the country. Are our Shanghainese smart enough?</p>
<p>Some people think that in China in an era of turmoil, even revolution is not enough, and this kind of activity fundamentally exposes the contradictions of the times. Well, that statement is clearly subjective. With a national character that is so strong in its desire for leadership, it is simply impossible not to produce an emperor. Simply put: with an empress, there will absolutely be no "midnight emptiness before the seat." Who wouldn't want to be Emperor Uncle?</p>
<p>We as citizens are always in danger of being beheaded. How about we be slaves? We want to shout "Long live the emperor, long live the empress!"</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: The Humble Room Blossoms with Fragrance—Secret Admiration for the Strong Man, the Quan Family Chooses a Good Match, and Scorns the Poor Girl</p>
<p>This conversation gave Zhao Weng an even better impression of the Jiang family. After returning to her room, she said to Guizhi, "This old man has a good heart, no wonder he raised a son who is a company commander." Guizhi immediately took the clothes in hand and hurried to make them, without any deep meaning in her mother's words. Seeing her daughter so eager to sew, Jiang couldn't be lazier than her. She also lowered her head, threading the needle and getting busy. Before twelve o'clock in the morning, she actually finished a robe. Guizhi burned the iron, ironing the clothes flat, and not even having time to eat, she wrapped the clothes in a piece of white cloth and sent them to the Gan family across the street. The owner of the Gan family, Gan Houzhi, was just coming out of the inner room when he met Guizhi in the courtyard. He smiled and nodded, saying, "Old girl, are you making clothes for our Jizhi again?" Guizhi said, "It's a robe for your second master Zhennian." Houzhi said, "He's not at home. You can leave it at your house, and I'll have your errand boy pick it up later. Why did you have to make a trip?" Guizhi heard that Jizhi wasn't home, so there was no need to send it to the inner room. Seeing the little errand boy standing next to him, she handed it to him and said with a smile, "Please give this to the second master, saying that the size of this dress was made according to the size of the last cotton robe. If it doesn't fit, take it to be altered. It's best if the second master wears it and lets me see it, so I can see where it doesn't fit and alter it there." The errand boy agreed and took the clothes inside. Guizhi couldn't see Jizhi, so naturally she went home. Houzhi watched Guizhi's shadow go far away. He didn't walk outside, but turned back to the inner room. His wife, Gan, was opening a box, looking for two good pieces of clothing to prepare to go to the city tomorrow to celebrate her elder brother's birthday at her maiden's home. Her elder brother had once served as a provincial governor, and although he was now retired and living in Beijing, he still had some political influence. Gan Houzhi, the director of the Western Suburb River Works Bureau, also owed his position to the influence of his elder maternal uncle. Mrs. Gan saw her husband walk in with an unhappy face and asked, "Who are you angry with?" Houzhi lit a cigarette and sat sideways on the back chair, lost in thought. After a long time, he exhaled a puff of smoke and said, "I laugh at our Jizhi for not being ambitious and falling for that old girl across the street. They visit each other every day, if not you coming, then me going." (20)</p>
<p>The Voice of National Salvation</p>
<h3>Suggestions for an Open-Air University (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yizeng</p>
<p>Reading is learning to be a person. Reading does not necessarily make you a person, but to be a complete person, you must read. Reading costs money. With money, you can read, and without money, you cannot read. This is aristocratic education. Popular education spreads knowledge, and my knowledge can be transformed into the knowledge of others, thus becoming a tool for society. The more widespread knowledge is, the more human happiness will increase.</p>
<p>An open-air university is a tool for popularizing knowledge. For this reason, I wrote a letter to Harvard University President Lowell, asking him to broadcast Harvard courses by radio, because the perfection of the school's curriculum is recognized by scholars around the world, and its high tuition fees are also a source of lament for poor students. Not only that, but people with jobs who are interested in research also suffer from not having time to attend school. I personally requested that Harvard's curriculum be promoted by radio. A week later, President Lowell's reply came, politely saying that public education also has its limitations. We know that Harvard is an aristocratic school, and the president is also aristocratic. After returning to my motherland, I always wanted to put this proposal into practice domestically. Open-air universities can not only avoid the recent popular student unrest, but also be very cheap in terms of economics. The school buildings do not have to be very grand, and management can also be much more convenient. Generally, students with pure character can no longer be affected by any political party, and can stop in the middle of the road. I have again petitioned the government authorities, explaining the pros and cons in detail, requesting that it be held, but under such a political situation, how can the matter of education invite an adult gentleman to take a look? Unfortunately, I can only study the plan of the Open-air University here with readers who are enthusiastic about education, hoping for criticism and sponsorship until success.</p>
<p>I have observed the current students, and they can be roughly summarized into two types. These two types are the most苦的students; one is those who have money to study but have no good school to enter; the other is those who have the ambition to study but have no money to enter school. The tuition fees of universities are too expensive now. An ordinary student in Shanghai needs about four hundred gold in expenses a year. If the family is poor, how can his family bear such a heavy burden? I often say that if Edison was in China, he would not be able to become a world-renowned scientist. Chinese newsboys can only sell newspapers for life. Very bitter Chinese newsboys, what opportunities do they have to study on their own! I visited a newsboy's club in Boston, which included reading, music, advertising, speeches, sports, etc. Even if they don't have a talent for invention, because the environment for learning is perfect, they can create a writer or inventor. I don't believe that among our 400 million Chinese people, there is not a single person like Mr. Ai? I lived in the countryside for two months this year and learned that there are many farmers with wisdom. I always want to give them the opportunity to develop their talents. In the ideal open-air university, we can create the Confucius, Mencius, Edison, Ford, and all the inventors of the 20th century.</p>
<p>The method of open-air university is much simpler than that of ordinary universities. All it needs are a few experts' audio discs and a few broadcasting stations. Each station serves as a department. First, invite experts to record the sound into an audio disc like an opera disc, and then send it to each department's broadcasting station for broadcasting. The poor, the rich, the old, and the young can all study. The rich can study at home behind closed doors, and students who have no money to buy electricity can go to the public education center to listen. On the one hand, please experts to compile books to make it easier for students to listen to lectures. Students can listen and read at the same time. If they have any questions, they can use the communication method to ask questions, or call or go to the public education center to see the assistant teacher, or consult the professor at the nearby university for explanation. The open-air university also has assistant teachers who answer students' questions to facilitate students' questioning. At present, China is in a process of constant change and progress. An open-air university like Harvard Road in the United States, Cambridge and Oxford in the United Kingdom, should be established. The open-air university can be divided into several departments, each department has an independent broadcasting station, and there are several assistant teachers who specialize in answering students with questions. If so, university education can have the hope of popularization.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Collects Middle School Graduation</h3>
<h3>Examination Questions Methods</h3>
<p>Orders all public and private secondary schools in the province</p>
<p>Submit for reference before April 30</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department used the previous year's (21st year) spring junior high school graduation examination as an opportunity to ensure that the examination questions were suitable for the teaching conditions of each school, and that the graduating students of each school could prepare adequately in advance. The "Measures for Collecting 21st Year Spring Junior High School Graduation Examination Questions" were formulated and circulated to all public and private secondary schools and above in the province for compliance. Now, in the second semester of the 21st year, both senior and junior high school levels have students graduating, and the number of classes and students graduating from each school is larger than the previous year. All examination matters are even more cumbersome, and preparations should be made as early as possible to ensure thoroughness. In reference to the previously issued methods, we have formulated new "Measures for Collecting Secondary School Graduation Examination Questions for the Second Semester of the 21st Year" and circulated them for compliance. The measures are as follows:</p>
<h3>Measures for Secondary School Graduation Examination Questions for the Second Semester</h3>
<p>(1) These measures are formulated in order to ensure that the examination questions are suitable for the teaching conditions of each school and that the graduating students of each school can prepare in advance. These measures are circulated to all middle schools in the province for compliance. (2) After receiving the order, each school should immediately have teachers of each subject formulate examination questions for each subject of the senior and junior high school examinations separately, and submit them to the department before April 30 for reference by the examination committee. Schools with only junior high schools may be exempted from formulating senior high school examination questions, and schools with only senior high schools may be exempted from formulating junior high school examination questions. Schools with graduating classes in the spring of this year that have already formulated and submitted junior high school examination questions in accordance with the previously issued "Measures for Collecting 21st Year Spring Junior High School Graduation Examination Questions" may be exempted from submitting junior high school examination questions. (3) Each school may conduct trial tests of the examination questions formulated by itself in the graduating classes of the school in order to prepare. (4) The examination questions for each subject are not limited to the teaching materials of the last semester, and should be based on all teaching materials of the three years, with uniform distribution without adding weight. (5) The scope of the examination questions for each subject is based on the "Provisional Curriculum Standards" promulgated by the Ministry. (6) The examination questions for each subject are not limited to the textbooks used by the school, and should refer to the various textbooks approved by the current Ministry of Education for mixed questions. (7) The examination questions for each subject, except for Chinese and foreign languages, may be formulated separately for various types of composition questions. Mathematics may be formulated separately for ordinary question types. All others should use test question types, without limiting the number of various test question types, such as the right and wrong method, the selection method, and the filling method. (8) The content of the test is not limited to the memory of facts. All that belongs to understanding, reasoning, etc., can be tested. (9) The examination questions should be attached with answers. Both the examination questions and answers must avoid being cumbersome and strive for accuracy. (10) Physical education, in accordance with the Ministry of Education's interpretation, will be examined and graded by the original schools and sent to the department for review. No examination questions need to be formulated. If necessary, sample examination questions will be stipulated separately.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Supervisor's Inspection Report on Jiangxi Education (Part 1)</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that Jiangxi has been greatly affected by the communist bandits in recent years, and the education must have been greatly affected. In order to understand the actual situation, the Ministry of Education specially sent Supervisor Zhong Daoqi to inspect the province's education in February of this year, and pay attention to the promotion of vocational education, for about a month. A total of more than fifty institutions were inspected, including three specialized schools, eighteen secondary schools, seven social education institutions, eighteen primary schools, and two education bureaus. Supervisor Zhong has completed his work and returned to Beijing, and has completed the整理reporting. The content is divided into seven parts: general outline, specialized schools, vocational schools, secondary normal schools, primary schools, social education, and opinions on the improvement of education in Jiangxi. It is quite concise. Here, we disclose the important points:</p>
<p>1.  The teaching equipment of each specialized school, except for the medical school, can barely be used, and the rest feel lacking. Especially the factory and farm are the most difficult. The promotion of agricultural specialized schools is almost not held.</p>
<p>2.  Graduates of each specialized school, except for medical and civil engineering students, have no problem finding jobs. The rest are not easy to arrange. Especially agricultural science is the most difficult. Half of it is because the internship is not sufficient, and half of it is because the social business is very undeveloped.</p>
<p>3.  The internship problem of each specialized school should make full use of the holidays, and send students to various hospitals, coal mines, railway bureaus, and other vocational institutions for long-term apprenticeships in order to obtain real experience.</p>
<p>4.  Each specialized school should select those departments that are difficult to run or have poor job prospects from the existing departments, stop recruiting as necessary, and change to more socially needed departments. At the same time, unnecessary subjects should be deleted and practical training should be given.</p>
<p>5.  The purpose of the senior high school attached to each specialized school is to prepare for further studies, but it should also give students practical vocational training according to their economic and academic conditions, so that they can be self-reliant.</p>
<p>6.  Except for the Second Vocational School, which has no problem finding jobs for business students, most vocational schools are regarded as a way to prepare for further studies. Therefore, there are too many ordinary subjects and insufficient time for vocational subjects, and practice is not thorough.</p>
<p>7.  There are too many vocational subjects included in each department of each vocational school. Often one person has to learn four or five different types of occupations. As a result, there are many but not精, affecting job prospects. Moreover, the length of each department is the same and cannot be extended or shortened according to the nature of the occupation.</p>
<p>8.  Although the existing departments of each vocational school are not few, there is still a lack of architecture, drawing, furniture production, nursing, and commercial design. Attention should be paid to this.</p>
<p>9.  Girls' vocational supplementary schools have many subjects and are run like elementary schools, which is not the original intention of setting up the school. Ordinary subjects should be reduced and vocational training should be concentrated. The length of time should also not be too long.</p>
<p>10. Most vocational schools feel a lack of teachers, especially in skill subjects. It seems that technical personnel from the vocational industry should be hired as practical teachers as much as possible to emphasize practice.</p>
<p>11. Provincial No. 2 Middle School, Girls' Middle School, and private Xin Yuan, Gan Sheng, Bao Ling, Ru Li, Tong Wen, and other middle schools have achieved good results in running schools, and the equipment is passable. The school spirit of No. 1 Middle School was originally excellent, but recently it has become slightly relaxed due to the change of principal. The better trained is the Provincial No. 2 Middle School.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Increase Suddenly Halted</h3>
<h3>By Pittman Proposal</h3>
<p>Struggling around the 80 Yuan Mark for Quite Some Time</p>
<p>Still Ended Up 12 Yuan Higher Than Before</p>
<p>Although the gold market rose yesterday, it experienced a mid-day dip. In the early morning, due to a Reuters report that both near-term and long-term contracts in London rose by 1.875, while New York silver prices remained unchanged, and the British exchange rate fell by 1.5 fen, and the British-American exchange rate decreased by 1.625, with forward silver prices also down by 0.8 hao, sentiment improved. The market opened at 1079 yuan. When the foreign exchange market opened, the British exchange rate was at 1 shilling, 8 pence, and 375, slightly tighter than the previous close by 0.125, and the American exchange rate was at 29 yuan, tighter by 0.0625, initially dropping to 7 yuan, then gradually improving. In the foreign exchange market, the American exchange rate for June was at 29.625 yuan, and May's rate was at 29.375 yuan, both difficult to settle, breaking through the 80 yuan mark. Afterwards, although banks continued to sell, the gold market rebounded. Market buying was very strong, with broad support, pushing the price to 1087.8 yuan, another new high after the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan. However, with the foreign exchange market still weak and many selling off, a downstream trend was observed, but the decline was still manageable. When news of a silver price meeting came, sentiment wavered. Korea sold June's American exchange rate at 29.5 yuan. Although HSBC's listing showed the US dollar shrinking by 0.125, and the shilling remained unchanged, it fell to within the 80 yuan range, then hovered as the foreign exchange market tightened slightly. Mitsui bought July's US dollar at 8.75, and MacGalli and Mitsui repurchased July at 7.5, with broad support remaining. There was a rebound, but as sentiment had already panicked, it fell to 1076.5 yuan. Later, due to many taking advantage of the low price, Mitsui bought May's US dollar at 4.375, and June's US dollar at 6.25, difficult to settle, recovering to 84 yuan. The mid-day close was 1082.8 yuan. The market situation was stable for half a day, and the price still rose. The spot premium remained at 37 yuan.

May's 3.75 was also difficult to settle. Daxing Yong also came to buy. Hengxing then advanced fiercely, and the gold price rose to 4 yuan, then to 5 yuan. Yuanheng Wanxing sold June's US dollar at half a yuan, perhaps settleable, receding to 1.5 yuan. Qian Changxiang came to buy, and the price continued to rise. Hengxing bought tirelessly, and the price surged to 1087.8 yuan, another new high. HSBC sold April's US dollar at 9.375, and Yuan Maoyong's spot goods were sold at 3.5 yuan. However, due to Hengxing's strong buying interest, the price was still pulled to 5.8 yuan. At this time, Zhifeng Yong took the opportunity to buy slightly. Pan Gen came out, with July's US dollar at 7.5, and Xiexing Yong, Zhaofeng Chang, and Shunli all came to sell. Although there was a decline, Hengxing and Fuyu still intended to buy, making a great effort. According to Reuters, US Senator Pittman proposed a silver price meeting. Korea sold June's American exchange rate at 29.5 yuan. Fuchang Yuanheng then came to sell heavily, down to within 2 yuan. Mitsui was even willing to sell June's US dollar for only 5.625. Heng Yu and Zhifeng Yong all sold, breaking the 80 yuan mark. HSBC's listing was also announced at this time, with the shilling unchanged and the US dollar shrinking by 0.125, not much concerning. Hengxing repurchased, and Mitsui bought July's US dollar at 8.75, increasing from 79 yuan to 80 yuan. MacGalli bought July's US dollar at 8.125, showing a slight improvement. Shortly after, Mitsui repurchased July at 7.5, and Hengxing repeatedly absorbed the price, raising it to 83.8 yuan. Zhifeng Yong and Zhaofeng Chang sold down to within 1 yuan. HSBC bought April's US dollar at 0.0625, improving the price by 2 yuan. However, the trend was confusing. Zhongnan suddenly released June's US dollar at 6.25. Although Dadecheng and Yuankangxiang bought, the price still broke to within 80 yuan. At this time, the struggle around the 80 yuan mark was prolonged. Pee to June's US dollar 6.25, difficult to settle, then went downstream again from 81 yuan. Heng Yu sold spot goods, and Holland sold June's US dollar, already at 6.875, falling to 77 yuan. Under the hovering, the broker bought July's US dollar at 9.375. Hengxing slightly sold to 9.8 yuan on behalf of the customer. Holland then released April's US dollar at 1.25. Retail investor's psychology was weak, and they came to sell, falling further to 76.5 yuan. Mitsui bought May's US dollar at 4.375. Fuyu Qian Changxiang all came to compete, rising to 80 yuan. June's US dollar at 6.25, the female knot, Rende Cheng and Fuyu bought at 84 yuan. The market was already approaching the close, and the foreign exchange market lacked transactions.

Fuchang and Qian Changxiang all sold, falling back to 79 yuan. Therefore, spot goods were slightly lower, priced at 80 yuan. The highest price for the half-day was 1087.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 1076.5 yuan, a difference of 11.3 yuan. The result was an increase of 12.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price, due to HSBC's listed US dollar shrinking by 0.125, was at 28.5 yuan, totaling a gold price of 1169.29 yuan. According to the closing price, the premium was approximately 86 yuan, a premium of 7 yuan less than the previous close. The registered amount for this month was the same as April at 112 yuan, May at 1083 yuan, and water at 1107 yuan.</p>
<p>Market transactions were still strong. In summary, Dan Xing, Qian Changxiang, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Yu Yifeng Yong, Yuan Maoyong, Bingxing Qingfa Yong, etc. all bought.

<h3>US President Pays Attention to Silver Problem</h3>
<p>丨White House Meeting Necessary to Maintain丨</p>

He would see the establishment of a law to prevent criticism or attack on the American gold standard, while restoring the original purchasing power to allow silver coins to circulate in the world.</p>

According to the interpretation, there are no restrictions on silver for the delivery of goods. Only those who withdraw large amounts of cash for storage abroad will be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Slightly Better Silver Coin Inflow and Outflow</h3>
<p>The financial market situation has been sluggish since the abolition of the li, and the settlement has remained stagnant. Recently, due to external uses, there has been a slight turnaround. Therefore, in the past few days, it has gradually flourished, and the bank settlement has also felt busy. However, the market sentiment and the green li price regulations have made trading less vigorous. There are only hundreds of thousands of transactions every day. Yesterday, the remittance bill was only 200,000 in the early market and 565,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were completely absent, and the branch orders were particularly high, 100,000 in the early market and 530,000 in the afternoon market.

<h3>Securities Public Debt Short Covering Turns Into Rising Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese merchant bond market turned into a rising trend again. The rumors in Tianjin the other day were completely unfounded. The short sellers gradually started to cover their positions. In the morning session, the market was slightly chaotic. The initial opening was slightly higher by one or two jiao, but the middle remained weak. For example, the 19th pass was four jiao lower. Afterwards, the unified salt tax returned to a high of two or three jiao, but entries and exits were still rare. In the second session, the northern gang had needs again, and the 16th and 17th numbers were all buying, resulting in a consistent return of one or two jiao to more than four jiao. Sentiment gradually became stronger. The afternoon opening was even more stable, with more short covering, and a continuous increase of one or two jiao to six jiao five fen. The closing was stable. As a result, there was a consistent increase of several jiao to more than one yuan. The decline due to rumors the other day, yesterday the rumors were false, creating a rebound situation. There are not many days left for trading this month, and there is a deep fear of a potential short squeeze. The total number of transactions was calculated to be a total of 6,661,000 yuan. Inside, the spot ancestral pass made one thousand yuan, and the futures salt tax accounted for the most, totaling 1,935,000, the disbandment of troops 1,150,000, the unified tax only eight hundred thousand and change, the 20th, 20th volume each made more than 600,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to three hundred or four hundred thousand.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Weakness More Apparent</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still weak, sentiment is quite weak, and there is no sign of recovery. Due to excessive inventories and extremely stagnant consumption, and with the end of the month approaching, general buyers view the environment unfavorably and are cutting positions.

<h3>Cotton Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>丨American Cotton Falls丨Indian Cotton Infringes Sales丨</p>
<p>American cotton has shown instability again, and the decline is more severe. However, the local cotton market was not greatly affected due to the strong bullish sentiment. However, Indian cotton fell sharply in the black market, and the calculated silver price of foreign cotton fell by about one or two taels. As for the current cotton sales, they are still weak. Due to the slump in the yarn market, the factories do not purchase high-priced raw materials. If American cotton continues to fall, there is deep concern that local cotton will be difficult to be different.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Falls by 20 to 30 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices were weak due to a lack of major buyers, a sluggish Wall Street, and unfavorable news from Liverpool. Futures prices fell by 24 to 29 points, and spot prices fell by 30 points. British cotton futures fell by 3 to 4 points, and spot prices rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 1 point. Indian cotton trading was suspended. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegraph on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Grains: Flour Futures Weak Near-Term, Higher Far-Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed weakness in all months in the morning. Foreign wheat prices continued to fall by about 0.2 to 0.3 taels. The current month hovered around 1.766 taels due to slight sales. Distant months showed sluggishness due to small imports of foreign wheat, but trading was not active, falling only 0.0025 taels compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the current month continued to hover. The Tianjin group slightly sold off, while Xin Da, Shen Da, and others slightly replenished their stocks, showing mutual exclusion. Distant months were stable due to the lack of activity in spot foreign wheat caused by tight exchange rates. Factories also did not release new supplies, leading to a recovery in sentiment. However, overall trading was slow, lacking vitality. As a result, the current month fell by 0.0025 taels compared to the previous day, April rose by 0.0025 taels, May rose by 0.0075 taels, and June, July, and August rose by 0.005 taels.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Almost Stalled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was unusually stagnant. Only the current month saw some trading in a few carts in the morning, with the rest being empty bids. In the afternoon, only the current month and August saw slight trading, with no other activity. The quiet atmosphere was truly rare. As the current month approached delivery, it was heard that Ding Tai had prepared to deliver 30 to 40 carts of goods. However, it was reported yesterday that foreign wheat had already been loaded onto the docks, preparing for spot sales, so many offset their positions on the exchange. As a result, the current month rose by 0.01 taels compared to the previous day, and August also rose by 0.01 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Raw Sugar Prices Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices were as follows: Association #24 coarse white sand at 15.1 taels, top-grade RA at 15.3 taels, #20 medium white sand at 14.65 taels, #18 at 14.45 taels, all up by 0.05 taels. #8 Dutch raw sugar at 11.8 taels, up 0.1 taels. Raw sand raw sugar at 13.9 taels. On the foreign firms' side, Hua Xin offered 1,300 bags of #90 Dutch raw sugar spot at 11.9 taels. Chang Xing offered a batch of Guanghua-produced green-letter cotton white sugar at 15.3 taels. On the local firms' side, the Chaozhou group offered 500 to 600 bags of Chao Qing at 8.68 taels, and lower grades at 8.5 to 8.45 taels (excluding broker commission). Taikoo sugar prices remained mostly unchanged, with B at 15.95 taels, CW at 15.85 taels, DY at 15 taels, and HX at 15.7 taels. Although Hainan raw sugar prices were called higher, no transactions occurred.</p>

<p>Angle iron and English steel plates were previously scarce, leading to buyers rushing to purchase them to prevent shortages. Yesterday, it was heard that New Taikoo North Warehouse and other docks had shipments arriving, although not in large quantities. It is expected that there will be no shortage of these goods in the market.</p>

<h3>The People's Duty</h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>The people's duty lies in abiding by laws and paying taxes. Consequently, the duty of the government, which governs and controls the people, lies in enforcing laws and collecting taxes. The quality of a people is judged by their ability to abide by laws and pay taxes. Similarly, the quality of a government is judged by its ability to enforce laws and collect taxes. I dare say that our current government is indeed a good government.</p>
<p>The government is composed of officials, and a good government has good officials. A good official is one who can carry out the necessary tasks of a good government, that is, enforce the government's laws to govern the people and collect taxes. I believe that all our current officials are also good officials; they can all fulfill their duties and will ensure that the people are law-abiding and dutiful. Here, being dutiful means paying taxes, and being law-abiding is, of course, a brief way of saying abiding by the laws.</p>
<p>It is enough for the people to fulfill the duties they should fulfill. There is no need to interfere in other matters. For example, once taxes are paid, that is the end of the matter. There is no need to ask about how the money is used. Because the people are always just the people. If they do things that the people should not do, they will violate the laws of the country and become bad and treacherous people. Good officials will certainly not bear this and will certainly correct them. This is also one aspect of their enforcement of the law.</p>
<p>The government's affairs are naturally handled by the government. There is no need for the people to participate in or interfere. If there is a government, and the government's affairs still require the people to assist, then what is the use of the government? Therefore, in matters such as resisting Japan, the government always instructs the people to remain calm and contribute financially. Because the people's duty really does not go beyond these two paths. Remaining calm is abiding by the law, and contributing financially is taking out money. Being able to take out money and also abide by the law, the people's duty is fulfilled. There is no need for anything else.</p>
<p>However, recently, the government announced the organizational law of the National Political Council and the principles of the member election law. This is really a bit illogical. If the word "National" is interpreted as "People", then if there is something called "National" other than "People", then it must be clearly defined to avoid confusion with the people, lest there be a danger of passing off dross as gold. Because the people's duty is as described above, they are definitely not worthy to participate in any politics.</p>
<p>If the "National" who participate in politics are indeed the people, then there is really a great danger. First, because it will damage the government's authority. The people were originally governed, and it was enough to pay taxes. They have always been humble and submissive. If they are once raised up to stand as equals with the government, will they not despise the government's authority in the future? Politics is a strange thing. If you get your hands on it, it can change people's minds. Therefore, if the originally docile people are given the right to participate in politics, they will become unruly and fierce, making them difficult to govern. Wouldn't that be annoying?</p>
<p>Moreover, the people have not asked for any right to participate in politics. The people now only ask to pay less taxes and for fewer laws to be promulgated. Now, giving them the great power of participating in politics is too ill-considered. This kind of method is very likely to make the people forget their duty to pay taxes and instead think about interfering in the government's actions. This should really be paid attention to. Fortunately, it has only been passed by the Central Standing Committee and still needs to be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. But the matter is already like riding a tiger, and it is feared that it is bound to be implemented. Then, one can only hope that this Political Council is nominal and not real, so as to avoid the danger of disrupting the laws of the country.</p>
<p>This is very important when drafting the regulations. As long as a little effort is made, it can be done. I think our drafting committee members are all good officials, and they are all intelligent, so they must have made preparations in those areas.</p>
<h3>Remembering Joseph</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The sensational case in Shanghai of the Italian Uveugu accusing Xue Jinyuan of seducing his son Joseph has given me deep feelings. Joseph studied with me for four months seven or eight years ago. He was very intelligent and had a good physique, but unfortunately, his environment was not good. His father, an Italian, was extremely extreme in his emotions. He wanted Joseph to receive a Western education, but after entering a Western school, he soon came out. His mother, from Suzhou, was too docile. She wanted Joseph to receive an Eastern education, hoping that I would teach him things like the "Three Character Classic," but after four months, he was not seen entering a formal elementary school. For the past ten years, Joseph has been neither Western nor Eastern, and the result is that he has not received any education. I once said to a friend: "It is not okay for children in Shanghai to not receive an education. If you don't educate him, there is a big school - the society of Shanghai - that will educate him. By the time you find that the tree trunk is already bent, there is no way to save it." Sure enough, Miss Xue Jinyuan came to be Joseph's professor. Even without seduction, her daily instruction and polishing work produced very good results. To let a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old child tumble in the palm of a courtesan is a terrible thing!</p>
<p>Family education in Shanghai has developed strangely. Some people regard their children as precious orchids and trees, and they must be planted in front of the steps. Each family hires a tutor to receive the most old-fashioned education. This kind of child education, isolated from society, means that children can never participate in community life, just like flowers and plants locked in a room, never seeing the sun. A sudden storm will knock them to pieces. The fate of precious orchids and trees is often like this. Some people treat their children as wild horses, letting them run wild in society. First, there is alleyway education, then street education, and finally playground and dance hall education. Hustling, messing around, loitering... a complete set of "three-education" textbooks creates a large group of young rascals. Children are like weeds on the edge of a rice paddy, trampled by cattle and sheep, leaving no vitality. This is how the previous generation harms the next generation, a cycle of cause and effect without end! Miss Xue Jinyuan has taught Joseph, and Joseph has taught many misses, expanding the position of social news in the newspapers every day. The worsening of syphilis is spreading to the entire society of Shanghai. How can this not be chilling!</p>
<p>Please, people from all walks of life in Shanghai, do not take this matter as a trivial joke. This is a major issue of child education facing us! In the Soviet film "Road to Life", it says at the beginning: "A child without education is a destroyer of the construction of the new society." Shanghai is already full of gangsters, rascals, beggars, and all kinds of vagrants. Now, still letting them constantly teach and train the reserve team, how can we avoid the fate of total collapse!</p>
<h3>Ah Q is Always Alive</h3>
<p>— Qi Yu</p>
<p>This is a small protest: Who says Ah Q is dead? He is indeed still alive and well, and his luck is in full swing.</p>
<p>Those who doubt this will surely ask in surprise, "Where's the evidence?"</p>
<p>Well, look—</p>
<p>Didn't the × month × day ×× newspaper carry a speech by a certain official, saying that "The violent sun's artillery fire is not to be feared; within ten years, Japan will surely have a major revolution"?</p>
<p>What is the difference between saying this and someone who is unable to take revenge on their enemy and hopes that their enemy will get sick?</p>
<p>Even three-year-old children know that this is a pathetic, cowardly, and powerless statement, yet it comes from the mouth of a high-ranking official. I am really a little worried for him. Why doesn't he say something readily available? If he were to say: "Japan has recently suffered a major earthquake and will soon withdraw its troops and return the lost territories, which is not a problem," wouldn't that be more likely to make the foolish common people believe and feel at ease?</p>
<p>I remember that every time Ah Q was beaten, he would mutter, "I was only beaten by my son!" to console himself and seek spiritual victory. When I was young, I only found it funny, but now I realize that Ah Q's spirit is our national philosophy.</p>
<p>Who says Ah Q is dead? Ah Q is always alive!</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Time and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guanping</p>
<p>"That Pastor Liao forced him to go! Old Liao wanted him to tell Old Ha to increase his salary from January next year."</p>
<p>"How much salary does Pastor Liao get every month?"</p>
<p>"Fifty yuan. He asked for an increase to eighty yuan. But Old Ha didn't agree. Later it was reduced to seventy yuan, but he still didn't agree. Old Liao then reduced it to sixty yuan..."</p>
<p>"Then Old Ha is too stingy."</p>
<p>"Isn't he! Old Liao has been working in the church for twelve or thirteen years. Old Ha still won't budge even if he only adds ten yuan." Every time Madam Cao said "Isn't he!", she would slightly tilt her head, and her lips would move very quickly, which further reduced her beauty and the first condition of womanhood, gentleness.</p>
<p>"Then what did Old Liao do?"</p>
<p>"With Old Ha being so unfeeling, Old Liao couldn't bear to ask directly. So, he asked Shiguang to act as if he were advising him on his own, asking Old Ha to add five yuan to his salary from January next year. Shiguang went to the church on the day before yesterday and yesterday, but he didn't meet that foreign devil, and he just wasted the fare. Mr. Lin, Christmas is coming soon, they are busy, so Shiguang went to the church early this morning again, hoping to catch him before he left. He has been running around for nothing for Old Liao's five yuan." "Religious people are really stingy!"</p>
<p>"Not just stingy, completely cruel! There's no future in working for religious people. I often regret it. I'm not saying bad things about Mr. Cao, but I really married the wrong person! I never knew he was so useless!"</p>
<p>After she said this, she looked at Haiquan with a flirtatious smile. Haiquan thought again, "I really don't deserve this."</p>
<p>Twenty-Eight</p>
<p>After sitting foolishly in Cao Shiguang's house for a while, he remembered the chewing gum in his pocket, and he hurriedly took it out.</p>
<p>"This is something I bought along the way out of boredom, but it's still special..."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>Madam Cao didn't stand on ceremony at all and took the packs of chewing gum.</p>
<p>"...Oh, I thought it was something else. Mr. Lin, Chewing Gum? I loved to eat it when I was in girls' school!"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Cao, you also know Chewing Gum?"</p>
<p>Haiquan was a little surprised. How could she be so fashionable, have eaten Chewing Gum, and even said that she had lived in a girls' school? He wondered which girls' school it was.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Reading</h3>
<p>— Wang He</p>
<p>Recently, because the Japanese dwarfs have been bullying our Chinese nation too much, I am indignant and deeply hope that some literary works that can promote national consciousness will emerge. At the very least, there should be some publications like "National Literary Selections," so that "words have power, and the national spirit can be awakened." A few days ago, I saw a newspaper advertisement for "National Literary Selections" compiled by the Chinese Literature Department of Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang Middle School. Overjoyed, I went to a certain bookstore on Simalu Road to buy a copy. Upon returning, I burned a good incense in front of Yue Wumu's portrait and carefully read it. The first article I read was The Biography of Shi Kefa (selected from the History of Ming), which contains the following passage:</p>
<p>Shiying (referring to Ma Shiying) then entered his duties that day and proposed dividing Jiangbei into four garrisons: Liu Zeqing, Earl of Dongping, administered Huaihai and Huaibei, managing the military affairs of Shandong Province; Gao Jie administered Xusi, stationed in Sishui, managing the military affairs of Kaigui; Liu Liangzuo administered Fengshou, stationed in Linhuai, managing the Chenqi region; Jingnan Earl Huang Degong administered Chuhe, stationed in Luzhou, managing the Guanggu region. This passage confused me: Liu Zeqing and Gao Jie both managed the military affairs of a province, while Liu Liangzuo and Huang Degong only managed a certain region, without "military affairs of a province" below. Could it be that the commander-in-chief was killed in battle outside Shanhaiguan while resisting the Manchurian puppet state? This reminded me of a former tutor who, when reading the Great Learning,</p>
<p>Knowing where to rest, you will have determination; having determination, you will be able to calm down; being calm, you will be able to be at peace; being at peace, you will be able to deliberate; being able to deliberate, you will then achieve. He was greatly puzzled by the lack of a "achieve" character at the end of the last sentence. Later, I ran to another private school and saw that the tutor there was troubled by the extra "achieve" character in the Great Learning, with nowhere to put it (because his punctuation was: Knowing where to rest, you will have; having determination, you will be able; being calm, you will be able; being at peace, you will be able; being able to deliberate, you will be able; achieve...). He happily said, "Having searched far and wide, I found it with ease! The 'achieve' character I was missing was actually here!" It's a pity that the two "commanders-in-chief" in "National Literary Selections" are nowhere to be found for the time being. Reading on,</p>
<p>Kefa had no son. He left instructions for Shi Dewei to be his successor. He had a younger brother, Kecheng, who became a Jinshi in the sixteenth year of Chongzhen and was promoted to Shujishi; when the capital fell, he surrendered to the rebels; when the rebels were defeated, he returned south. Kefa requested that he be punished, but Prince Li (note: a person's name line is added next to the two characters "Prince Li" in the original text) spared him for Kefa's sake and ordered him to support his mother. Kecheng then lived in Nanjing. Later, he lived in Yixing and died after forty years.</p>
<p>It turns out that Shi Kefa, who is considered a "national hero," could not uphold righteousness by killing his own relatives. He asked Prince Fu to pardon his unworthy brother (li means law, putting him to law means putting him to li). On the contrary, he asked Prince Fu to ignore his brother's betrayal and surrender to the rebels. Someone like this, who perverts the law for personal gain, is actually given a biography in the History of Ming, pretending to be a loyal minister of the Ming Dynasty and a national hero of China. It is truly unjust and wrong! (Please forgive me for quoting the idiom "acting important." I really didn't intentionally offend Mr. Shi Kefa. I say this because Mr. Shi Kefa is already dead. He won't accuse me of "acting important," send a letter demanding an apology, or even spend money to publish an advertisement. Similarly, Mr. Shi Kefa will not hire a lawyer to sue the editor of "National Literary Selections" in court.) Also, I have never seen the name "Prince Li" in the History of Ming or other unofficial histories of the late Ming Dynasty. I record it here to await further research.</p>

<p>Enemy Aircraft Reconnoitered Our Shihe Position This Morning</p>
<p>Leizhou: An enemy detachment, consisting of a brigade of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with more than a hundred armored vehicles and tanks as the backbone, launched a fierce attack on Xiaojiayingzi Mountain Temple, about thirty miles outside Lengkou, at 11:00 AM on the 22nd. Our [illegible] Division Commander personally supervised the troops and fought bravely, charging back and forth more than ten times. By 2:00 PM, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. At 3:00 PM, the enemy reinforced with reserves and launched a counterattack. The fierce battle lasted until 6:00 PM, when the enemy still could not withstand the attack and retreated in disarray. Our army captured three tanks and many guns and cannons. Inspections revealed the battle was as fierce as the Xifengkou and Gubeikou battles. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and our army also suffered some casualties. It has been confirmed that Company Commander Meng Zhankui and Platoon Leader Ma Dengying were killed in action. Morale is extremely high, preparations are thorough, and the enemy will not be allowed to cross the border a single step. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After He Zhuguo's headquarters moved to Leizhou, there were no changes in the front-line troops. Only the defense troops stationed at Jiumentou, Qindao, and other places were reassigned under Yao Dongfan's command. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Linyu: On the 21st, the enemy repeatedly attacked our army at Yiyuan Fortress, but were repelled by our army and the militia. At about 7:00 AM today, the enemy reinforced with about 2,000 mixed troops of the Japanese and puppet (Li Jichun) forces from Suizhong, and began to bombard our army's positions with more than a dozen aircraft and more than a dozen cannons for about two hours, followed by an infantry assault. Our army immediately dispatched [illegible] troops to reinforce. As of 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the fierce battle was still ongoing. There were five or six close-quarters combat engagements today.

<h3>National Military Training Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Training Supervision Department is implementing military training in schools, reaching 178 schools in seventeen provinces. The scope is vast. However, in the past, the operating system was directly between the schools and the Department, without an intermediate organization. Achievements may not be significant. Therefore, it is proposed to establish a National Military Training Committee in the education departments and bureaus of each province and city to create a comprehensive organization. A draft of eleven provisional regulations has been prepared and submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. The National Government has approved the record after submitting the report and instructed the Department to jointly issue a circular with the Ministry of Education for implementation.

<p>Wang Jingwei Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<h3>Still Humbly Declines the Premiership of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Wang Says His Visit to Shanghai is to Visit Song and Urge Him to Take Office</p>
<p>And Telegrams the Central Committee to Formally Appoint Mr. Song</p>
<p>Song's Attitude is Firm and He Still Urges Mr. Wang to Resume His Post</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, Premier of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and Vice Minister of Railways, Zeng Zhongming, etc., took the night train from Nanjing last night at 11:00 PM and arrived at Zhenru Station at 7:50 AM this morning, proceeding directly to his residence on Bo Shi Road for rest. Wang stated that his visit to Shanghai was to meet with Song Ziwen, Acting Premier of the Executive Yuan, and ask Song to formally take the post of Premier of the Executive Yuan. After Song agrees, Wang will immediately return to Nanjing and then go north on schedule to comfort the front-line soldiers and meet with Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang. Otherwise, he plans to stay in Shanghai temporarily, expressing his determination. After Wang got off the train, he telegraphed the Central Standing Committee, proposing to formally appoint Song as Premier of the Executive Yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Arriving at Zhenru Station) Our reporter drove to Zhenru Station at about 7:00 AM this morning. Besides the staff, there was no one in the station, and there were no arrangements for heavily armed military police security. Wang's secretary arrived at the station to greet him at about 7:40 AM. The train arrived at the station at 7:50 AM, and Wang and his wife, Zeng Zhongming, etc., got off the train and took a car directly to his residence on Bo Shi Road for rest.</p>
<p>(Wang's Remarks) Wang was wearing a gray suit when he got off the train at Zhenru Station. His face was rosy and his spirits were good. Our reporter immediately stepped forward to talk with him. According to Wang, regarding the issue of the Premier of the Executive Yuan, he firmly resigned because his illness had not yet healed and he could not handle the heavy workload. The Central Standing Committee will formally discuss this matter today. He has telegraphed to request the appointment of Mr. Song Ziwen as Premier of the Executive Yuan. The reason for his visit to Shanghai this time is to meet with Mr. Song and urge him to take office in person. After Song agrees, he will immediately return to Nanjing within a few days, and then go north on schedule to comfort the front-line soldiers and meet with Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang. Otherwise, he will stay in Shanghai temporarily and wait for the matter to be resolved.</p>
<p>(Visiting Song Ziwen in Person) Wang went to Song's residence at 9:30 AM, simply dressed, and sincerely expressed to Mr. Song that he really could not handle the heavy workload due to his illness and earnestly requested him to take on the difficult task and accept the post of Premier of the Executive Yuan. However, Mr. Song still declined humbly, saying that his physical strength was also weak and his blood pressure was still high, so he firmly refused to take office and refused to act as an agent again. The two discussed for a total of 30 minutes, but they still humbly declined each other and no results were achieved. Wang then bid farewell and left.</p>
<p>(Zeng Zhongming Expresses) According to Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways, who accompanied Wang to Shanghai, Mr. Wang refused to resume his post because his body could not support the heavy workload. The purpose of his visit to Shanghai this time was to persuade Mr. Song to go to Nanjing and take office to avoid resentment and harm the country. After Wang resigned from the post of Premier of the Executive Yuan, it did not mean that he would completely ignore state affairs, but would work in the Central Party Headquarters. As for whether Wang would return to Nanjing immediately, it depends on the situation of the contact with Vice Premier Song. The Central Committee held a Standing Committee meeting this morning to discuss this matter. If this matter is resolved, then Mr. Wang can enter Nanjing in one or two days. If Song still declines, the Central Committee has no intention of promoting other candidates. The time for the meeting between Wang and Chiang has not yet been determined. All parties intend to promote Chairman Chiang to be the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to unify military power, but this has not been heard in Nanjing. He will return to Nanjing by night train tonight.</p>
<p>(Telegram to the Central Committee) After arriving in Shanghai this morning, Wang telegraphed the Central Committee, proposing to the Central Standing Committee to formally appoint Acting Premier Song as Premier of the Executive Yuan. The original text read: To the Central Executive Committee, Zhao Ming resigned from the post of Premier of the Executive Yuan in August of last year. The Central Committee decided to order him to concentrate on serving in the Central Party Headquarters, and Vice Premier Song Ziwen was acting as Premier of the Executive Yuan. In mid-October, Zhao Ming applied for leave due to the severity of his illness and inability to serve in the Central Party Headquarters. He was granted a three-month leave to go to Europe for treatment. Recently, due to the fall of Rehe, he returned to Nanjing with all his strength, hoping to share this difficulty with his comrades. However, at this time, with all his efforts, he can only offer suggestions in the Central Party Headquarters at any time. As for the post of Premier of the Executive Yuan, the work is heavy and the responsibility is great. It is not a pity for the sick body, but the failure of the work and the misguidance of the country will be deeply blamed. Since entering Nanjing, he has repeatedly explained in detail to his comrades and hoped to be understood. Today is the date of the Central Standing Committee meeting, and he dares to sincerely request that the committee understands his sincerity and formally appoint Comrade Song Ziwen as Premier of the Executive Yuan, cancels the word "acting," so as to specialize in responsibility and unified perception. Zhao Ming will still be in the Central Party Headquarters as long as he has breath, following his comrades to face the national crisis together. He respectfully submits this proposal and awaits a public decision.</p>
<p>(Song Ziwen Firmly Declines) The reporter interviewed Acting Premier Song Ziwen at 10:30 AM this morning. According to Song, Mr. Wang came here this morning, saying that he would not return to his original position as Premier of the Executive Yuan and ordered him to continue to be responsible. However, he firmly stated that he could not take the position in order to specialize in finance. The position of Premier of the Executive Yuan should of course be resumed by Mr. Wang. In this period of increasing national crisis, if the whole country unanimously urges Mr. Wang, he can reluctantly take on the heavy task and overcome the national crisis together. The Central Committee's policy towards Japan is to resolutely resist and never compromise. There are often rumors of direct negotiations and compromises with Japan, which are not true. It is very clear that Japan cannot even accept the League of Nations resolution, and is about to withdraw from the League. How can it be possible to make concessions to us? And how can our government submit to a strong enemy and sign a treaty that would cut off the lifeblood of the country? Anyone who compromises with Japan will be abandoned by the whole country. He (Song) has no special knowledge of the military situation in North China, but he knows that the transfer of defenses in Leizhou is purely a necessary strategic move. The Japanese are clamoring to disturb Beiping and Tianjin, and we are also prepared. If the enemy recklessly invades Beiping and Tianjin, they will be met with a head-on blow. As for the recent promotion of the former Chairman to be the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to unify power, Chairman Chiang himself only seeks to win the war against the enemy and does not seek to take on the title.</p>
<p>(Chu Talks About Wang Seeking Medical Treatment) The Central News Agency in Nanjing telegraphed on the 23rd, that Premier Wang and his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and Deputy Railway Minister Zeng Zhongming, etc., took the night train to Shanghai on the evening of the 22nd, as reported in the newspapers. The Central News Agency reporter visited Chu Minyi at the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 23rd and asked when Wang would return to Nanjing. Chu replied that Wang had returned to the country, and travel between Nanjing and Shanghai was common for various premiers and committee members. As far as he knew, the purpose of this trip to Shanghai was to seek medical treatment and test blood. It is difficult for ordinary doctors to draw blood from veins for analysis. Dr. Nol, who accompanied Wang to Europe, also returned to Shanghai with Wang, so Wang is still asking him for treatment.</p>

<h3>Rehe Economic Work</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The Japanese-Manchu authorities have announced the following regarding economic work in Rehe Province: (1) Transportation: The roads in Rehe Province are worse than in other provinces, which greatly inconveniences economic development. The first priority is to construct roads. Construction of the two main roads between Beipiao and Chengde, and between Chaoyang and Chifeng, has already begun. Other lines will be started gradually. (A) Regarding telegraph and telephone: First, a new telegraph line between Chaoyang and Chifeng will be built. Then, a complete telegraph network will be established in the major settlements within the province, and some telephone lines will be opened at the same time. (B) Regarding postal services: The post offices in major settlements have already been placed under the administration of the Manchurian government. (2) Finance: Opium purchasing offices will be established in Chengde, Lingyuan, Chaoyang, and Chifeng. The opium cultivation tax, which was previously ten yuan per mu, will be reduced to five yuan. The annual opium production is estimated at about 300,000 guan. A. Regarding taxes: Indirect taxes will go to the central government, while direct taxes will be used for provincial expenses. B. Regarding customs duties: Customs offices will be established in Chengde, with branch offices at the forty gates along the Great Wall. C. Regarding finance: The Central Bank of Manchuria will establish branches in Chaoyang, Chengde, and Yifeng to recall the currently circulating banknotes. Furthermore, there are considerable prospects for the reserves of natural resources such as coal and oil. The military has recently decided to dispatch a large survey team.

<p>Germany's Active Diplomacy</p>
<p>Movement to Recover Overseas Territories</p>
<p>Japan's Refusal to Relinquish Mandated Islands</p>
<p>Causes Extreme Concern to German Government</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd: The issue of returning Germany's overseas territories has now become an important part of Germany's foreign policy. The National Socialist government attaches great importance to Japan's declaration that even if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will not return the Pacific islands formerly under its mandate. Today, official sources stated that this issue can only be resolved by the Council of the League of Nations and the Mandates Commission. If the Council of the League of Nations and the Mandates Commission can handle this matter, the German government will take the position of safeguarding all the interests of Germany's territories.</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: The Japanese Foreign Ministry received a report from its embassy in Germany stating that the German government issued a statement yesterday saying that the issue of the mandated rule of the South Pacific islands must be resolved by the Council of the League of Nations and the Mandates Commission. The German government has decided to assert its demands in these two bodies and will not make any separate representations to Japan. Although the Japanese government has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it has decided to continue participating in the Mandates Commission. Therefore, after withdrawing from the League of Nations, it will face even more serious conflicts with various countries in the League of Nations. The Japanese Foreign Ministry considers this statement to be an important issue and will carefully study how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Amidst Talk of German-Austrian Union</p>
<p>Calls for Restoration in Germany Resurface</p>
<p>Hitler's Dictatorship Seems Inevitable</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd: The Standing Committee of the Reichstag met today and the National Socialist Party's six votes defeated a motion to release eleven Social Democrat deputies still in detention. The Bavarian People's Party did not vote. The newly elected Prussian Parliament, with a National Socialist majority, met today and, after confirming the appointment of the government, immediately adjourned indefinitely. Amid cheers, National Socialist Deputy Dr. Kubel spoke of the National Socialist Party's ambition to unite Germany and Austria into a great nation. A deputy from the German National People's Party said that he hoped for the day when the Hohenzollern dynasty would be restored to rule Germany, which was also met with applause. The Reichstag will reconvene tomorrow and is expected to pass a bill granting dictatorial powers to Hitler's cabinet, allowing it to govern without the Reichstag. Tonight, the official organs of the National Socialist Party have already issued a warning that if the Reichstag does not accept the bill, it would be tantamount to declaring war on the National Socialist Party, and that the result would not only harm the opposition parties (the Centre Party, the Bavarian People's Party, and the Social Democratic Party) but also the voters. The National Socialist Party of the Saarland today sent a telegram to Chancellor Hitler protesting the fact that the police in Saarbrücken yesterday forcibly removed the party flag from the National Socialist headquarters.</p>
<p>France Raises Many Objections</p>
<p>Progress in Four-Power Cooperation is Slow</p>
<p>French Prime Minister May Visit Rome</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 22nd: French Prime Minister Daladier may visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome to discuss the Four-Power Pact between Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. However, France has raised many objections to this matter, which has slowed progress. France believes that the trend of the Four-Power Pact could divide European countries into several categories and damage the nature of the League of Nations, as member states of the League of Nations enjoy equal rights within the League.</p>
<p>Disarmament Conference Adjourns</p>
<p>Small Entente Countries Greatly Shaken</p>
<p>Poland and Romania Protest</p>
<p>France Takes a Wait-and-See Attitude</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 22nd: The adjournment declaration of the Disarmament Conference, jointly drafted by Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, British Prime Minister MacDonald, and Foreign Secretary Simon, has greatly shaken people here. Some view this declaration directly as the first move in four-power politics in Europe. Representatives of most secondary countries clearly stated that this matter has created a bad impression on their respective governments and criticized the British, saying that they want to use the Rome and Paris talks as an excuse for the adjournment of the Disarmament Conference. According to last December, after the five powers reached a compromise on the issue of equality of armaments, the General Committee did not consider it appropriate for a small number of countries to privately handle the matter outside the Disarmament Conference. Yesterday's announcement by Henderson and others about the adjournment news again raised doubts about the great powers' willingness to negotiate privately. Some say that Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu intends to express his views clearly in the name of the Little Entente countries, and Polish representative Raczkiewicz will certainly lodge a protest again. Henderson is well aware of this mentality, so his attitude tomorrow will be more reserved, unlike the frankness of yesterday's press release. It is likely that the adjournment will be requested by the British delegation or the Italian delegation, and Henderson will not advocate it himself. France will take a wait-and-see attitude. If the adjournment is indeed decided, the French representative will request that restrictions be placed on the adjournment time and that the various specialized committees continue their work. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu will soon go to Paris to state his views in the name of the Little Entente countries.</p>
<p>Havas, Athens, 22nd: Greece has expressed its approval in principle of British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan, but has raised some reservations on specific issues.</p>

They explained the construction of the northern border defenses. The Prime Minister made a detailed and clear report and stated that the cooperation between France and Belgium is close and sincere, and their relationship is extremely important.</p>

<h3>Sun's Troops Fight Bloodily With the Enemy</h3>
<p>Destroy Three Tanks and Kill Many Enemies</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying reported by telegram to Ping on the 20th that at dusk on the 19th, the enemy on the Liangdigoumen front attacked our left flank with over 3,000 cavalry and over 50 tanks and armored vehicles, and charged fiercely at our positions with a large number of troops, supported by over 20 field guns firing simultaneously. Our officers and soldiers calmly resisted, holding their fire until the tanks were close, then charged with broadswords and hand grenades. The enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated. The most tragic aspect of the battle was when our officers and soldiers were fighting to capture the tanks. The enemy inside the tanks fired machine guns and used mountain gun shells. It was only after over 90 officers and soldiers were killed that three tanks were destroyed, over 170-180 enemies were killed, and a company commander named Yamanouchi Dairō was captured. He will be sent to Ping soon. As of the time of the telegram, fierce fighting was still ongoing. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shao Yuanchong Arrives at Gubeikou</p>
<h3>To慰勞Frontline Soldiers</h3>
<p>Will Inspect the Beining Railway Area Soon</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shao Yuanchong, accompanied by Fu Rulin and staff members of the Central Propaganda Committee, arrived at the Gubeikou area on the 21st to inspect and慰勞 the armed comrades on the front lines. He met with senior generals at the front lines and extended his sincere regards. All the officers and soldiers were full of spirit and vowed not to coexist with the enemy. The fortifications and equipment were also very solid. It was also heard that the enemy has not been attacking recently and seems to be focusing all its efforts on the Xifengkou area, while taking a defensive posture at Gubeikou, only occasionally sending a few aircraft to侦察 our situation. Our army is not relaxing its vigilance due to the enemy's cessation of attacks and can launch a painful blow against the enemy at any time. Furthermore, the victory at Luowenyu near Xifengkou has boosted morale even further. Although the Guan Linzheng troops suffered heavy losses this time, the entire army's will to resist the enemy remains extremely strong, and internal replenishment is also being carried out. Given the opportunity, they will be able to continue their glorious struggle. However, all units feel a shortage of material supplies, and they hope that patriotic citizens and public organizations will provide continuous assistance so that soldiers can be well-fed and horses can be well-nourished, and they can exert their hot blood to fight for the survival of the country and the dignity of the nation. After the慰勞, Shao and others immediately returned to Ping to inspect the Beining Railway area. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Telegraphed</p>
<h3>Morale on the Front Lines is Extremely High</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Kong Xiangxi sent separate telegrams to Jiang and He, reporting on the inspection situation on the front lines, and said that the soldiers were very grateful for the central government's repeated慰勞 and that their morale was extremely high, vowing to resist and kill the enemy to the death. The enemy may attempt to attack Qingdao in Shandong Province, and our country has paid attention to it. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kong Xiangxi returned to Ping from Xifengkou on the morning of the 23rd. According to reports, the morale on the front lines is extremely high, and everyone is determined to die to defend the country. If the enemy invades, they will fight to the death. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

There were no battles on the 22nd, and Xifengkou was also calm. I used 25,000 yuan to慰勞 the troops on the front lines. After meeting with He on the 23rd, I will return to Nanjing in the afternoon.

<p>Liu Chongjie Reveals</p>
<h3>The Japanese Side's Absurd Rumors</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Chongjie said that the Japanese side has repeatedly spread rumors, and now they say that Yao Dongfan's troops have surrendered to the Japanese, that Song's troops have complaints due to unfair rewards, that He Zhuguo's troops will be transferred, and that a neutral zone will be established inside and outside the Great Wall. All of these are absurd rumors. Yao's division is now in Ludong, how could they fly over Yuguan and surrender to the tyrannical Japanese? Song's troops have records of rewards to soldiers, so there is no such thing as unfairness. He Zhuguo is currently stationed on the front lines of Jiukoukou and Shihe, which are being relied upon to guard against the enemy's infiltration of 东, so there will definitely be no sudden troop transfer. As for establishing a neutral zone, not only the entire population does not have this idea, but also the central and local authorities have no such intention. Our determination and overall plan to resist Japan have been determined long ago, and we will never compromise with the enemy again. Their spreading of such rumors is nothing more than wishful thinking on the part of the Japanese. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

According to a report from a reliable Japanese source, the rebel soldiers were Russian soldiers from the 55th Regiment stationed in Da Uria, and their mutiny took place at the end of February. They were subsequently suppressed by the Russian authorities, and many officers were arrested. It is heard that other regiments also sympathized with the rebel soldiers. The cause of the mutiny of the 55th Regiment was the poor and inadequate food and the fact that the soldiers had not been paid for three months. The soldiers accumulated grievances, which eventually erupted. Da Uria was formerly part of Mongolia, located between the Yablonovy Mountains and the Argun River. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Opposing Japanese Aggression</p>
<h3>Belgium Expresses New Views</h3>
<p>Havas, Brussels, 22nd: A Socialist senator questioned the government this afternoon as to what measures it will take to ensure international cooperation in preserving the integrity of Chinese territory and opposing Japanese aggression.

<h3>To Sign Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>Japanese Government Still Opposes It</p>
<p>Den-tsu, Tokyo, 23rd: The new Soviet Russian Ambassador Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Uchida yesterday afternoon to pay his respects upon taking office. Regarding the conclusion of a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty, he hoped to start negotiations at an appropriate opportunity. He then met with Vice Foreign Minister Arita to pay similar respects.</p>
<p>Den-tsu, Tokyo, 23rd: The Japanese government attaches great importance to the new Soviet Russian Ambassador Yurenev's hope to reopen negotiations on a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty. One concern is the relationship between the Soviet Russian government and third countries, the anti-Japanese propaganda of third countries, and its impact on Japan. Another concern is the opposing relationship between Soviet Russian foreign policy in the Far East and Japan's policy towards Manchuria. Some even advocate revising the Japanese-Russian Basic Treaty regarding the issue of anti-Japanese propaganda. Therefore, judging from the current situation, the Japanese government will naturally continue to give a negative answer to the Soviet Russian ambassador's proposal.</p>
<p>Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: It is heard that the immediate issue between Japan and Russia is the establishment of a joint committee of Japan, Manchuria, and Russia to resolve various issues arising on the borders of the three countries. Therefore, future negotiations between Japan and Russia seem to be focused on discussing the methods and means for this.</p>

<h3>Huge Amounts of Russian Goods Imported</h3>
<p>According to today's Japanese-language Shanghai Nippo, since the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, various goods from the Soviet Russian Federation have been continuously shipped to China, distributed from Shanghai to various cities and markets throughout China, which is very prosperous.

According to the import manifest of the third Russian merchant ship, the Khedivstroy, which arrived on the 21st, the following goods were imported: (1) 5,000 tons of kerosene, 500 tons of wheat, 1,000 tons of timber, and 1,000 tons of cotton cloth, with a total value of approximately 20 million taels. These goods have already been unloaded at the 16th Pier. Except for timber and coal, which are directly managed by Russian merchants, kerosene is sold by Guanghua Company, and cotton cloth is managed by Dachunghua Company.</p>
<p>Bodyguard Shouts Kidnapping</p>
<h3>Scaring Away Large Numbers of Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Zhang Yunjie Not Captured by Bandits</p>
<p>Kidnappers Made Detailed Preparations in Advance</p>
<p>Some Selling Wonton, Others Pulling Rickshaws</p>
<p>Fled in Panic, Abandoning Handguns</p>
<p>Kidnapping of Zhou Xitang Also Done by Such Gangs</p>
<p>Zhang Yunjie, a native of Ningbo, fifty years old, lives at No. 359, Gaoen Road, French Concession. He has been running a hardware store in Fengtian and is moderately wealthy. He owns a car with license plate number 6577 and hires Xue Sichuan, a native of his hometown, as a driver. Because kidnapping cases are now prevalent, for defense, he hired Qiu Zhaoshan from Hebei as a bodyguard to accompany him in and out. Zhang likes Peking opera and often goes to the Zhengyi Opera House at No. 184, Shandong Road, Nanjing Road, to learn Peking opera. This has become a habit. Yesterday morning, before 2:00 a.m. (late on the 22nd), Zhang, his wife, and Qiu Zhaoshan went to the Zhengyi Opera House again. When they came out at 2:15 a.m., just as they left the entrance of the opera house, suddenly six or seven kidnappers, each carrying a handgun, stepped forward and shouted threats, intending to kidnap Zhang. At that time, Qiu Zhaoshan, unprepared, did not have time to draw his gun to resist. He had no choice but to shout, "Kidnapping!" The bandits were startled by the shout, fearing that the police would arrive, and dispersed in all directions, abandoning Zhang. The relevant General Patrol Room received a report and immediately ordered Chinese detectives Xie Shuiquan, Pang Ruiqing, Geng Debiao, etc., to rush to the scene to search, but the bandits had disappeared without a trace. After investigation by Detective Xie and others, it was learned that the kidnappers' procedures this time were quite thorough. They had all disguised themselves in advance, some as wonton vendors, others as rickshaw pullers, pre-positioned in the small alley next to the Zhengyi Opera House to avoid the attention of law enforcement officers. The failure of the bandits this time was all thanks to Qiu Zhaoshan's shout. The bandits, in their hasty escape, left behind a handgun with nine bullets at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, in front of the Henglida Watch Company. The detectives picked it up and found that the gun number was 443803. The gun was owned by the Russian bodyguard Wei Weisharov of Zhou Xitang, a comprador of the Lao Gong Mao Foreign Company. Recently, Zhou suddenly encountered many kidnappers near the Dada Pier in the Chinese area, who attempted to kidnap Zhou. Zhou resisted, and the bandits immediately opened fire, wounding Zhou and killing the bodyguard Wei on the spot. They also robbed Wei of his gun and scattered in all directions. Zhou died of his injuries at Tongren Hospital. From this, it can be inferred that the bandits who kidnapped Zhang this time are the same gang who killed Zhou and Wei. The detectives later found two sets of wonton-selling equipment left behind by the kidnappers next to the Zhengyi Opera House and, along with the handgun, took them back to the police station, reported to the police chief, and informed all police stations to strictly pursue the escaped bandits.</p>
<p>Return of Savings from the Three Northeastern Provinces</p>
<h3>Registration Has Begun</h3>
<p>Storage and Exchange Bureau Announces Repayment Methods</p>
<p>After the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau received approval from the Ministry of Communications to repay savings from the three northeastern provinces, Mr. Fang Tinghua, Director of the Savings Department of the Bureau, drafted repayment regulations and registration procedures. The bureau will notify the regional postal administrations today and simultaneously announce the repayment regulations and begin registration. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Postal Administration Notice: For the purpose of notification, all depositors holding savings passbooks or fixed deposit certificates issued by various bureaus in the Liaoning postal area before July 23, 1932, and in the Jilin and Heilongjiang postal areas before July 25, 1932, must register in person or through their agents at the bureau. This is a notice to inform everyone.</p>
<p>Repayment Regulations: (1) For passbook savings, depositors may register their savings passbooks at any post office (excluding branch offices) that handles passbook savings. For fixed deposit certificates, registration should be done at the post office (excluding branch offices) that handles fixed deposits. (2) If depositors wish to leave their savings with the post office, the registered post office will issue new deposit certificates one month after registration. For savings originally deposited in Hanyang currency in the Jilin and Heilongjiang areas, if the savings passbook and deposit certificate do not specify silver dollars, they will be converted to silver dollars at an 80% discount. Interest on these retained savings will be calculated from the day after the last interest settlement date of the Northeast Three Provinces Post Office (i.e., from July 1, 1932). Interest on fixed deposits will be calculated from the original deposit date at the original interest rate. (3) If depositors wish to withdraw these savings, they must also wait one month after registration. They can then apply to the original registered bureau for a withdrawal form according to the usual practice, and withdraw the savings with their savings passbook or fixed deposit certificate. All withdrawal forms and fixed deposit certificates must bear the original seal of the depositor. The interest on all withdrawn savings will be calculated up to the registration date according to the method described in section 2 above. (4) If deemed necessary, the post office may require depositors to provide a reliable guarantor before repaying the savings. (5) All savings repayment matters will be handled at the original registered bureau. If the original savings were deposited in Hanyang currency (see section 2 above), repayment will be made in silver dollars at an 80% discount.</p>
<p>Scope of Registration: According to Mr. Fang Tinghua, Director of the Savings Department, speaking to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, all registration certificates and other items have been printed with designs and distributed to the postal administrations for printing. This is to facilitate depositors in obtaining and filling them out. To facilitate depositors, registration can be done in Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Shanghai, Guangdong, and other postal areas that handle postal remittances. The total amount to be repaid this time is approximately 230,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<h3>Problems of Road Construction Beyond the Settlement Boundaries</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul-General Requests a Japanese National as Head of Police Affairs</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Ishii, recently met with the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, to discuss the issue of road construction beyond the settlement boundaries. It is reported that the Consul-General intends to discuss this issue with the British Consul-General, Mr. Brenan, before the latter returns to his country. The Japanese authorities in Shanghai are now advocating that a Japanese national should be appointed as the head of police affairs in the areas where roads are constructed beyond the settlement boundaries, especially in the Hongkou district. The negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Government on the issue of road construction beyond the settlement boundaries have reached a deadlock, largely due to the demands of the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Active Preparations for the Wuhu-Zhapu Railway</h3>
<p>70% of the Share Capital Has Been Collected</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Has Also Joined as a Shareholder</p>
<p>Since the Jiangnan Railway Co., Ltd. started raising capital for the construction of the railway from Wuhu to Zhapu, many parties have subscribed and joined. Recently, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, has also joined as a shareholder. The company originally planned to raise one million yuan in national currency first, and now only 70% has been collected, so it has not been formally established. However, preparatory matters such as the measurement of the railway line, the purchase of materials, and the purchase of land have been substantially completed. It is reported that construction will begin as soon as the share capital is fully collected.</p>
<p>Antiquities of the Academia Sinica</p>

<p>After the Academia Sinica's Institute of History and Linguistics and the Institute of Psychology in Beiping decided to move south, in addition to the 120 boxes previously shipped to Shanghai, there were 400 more boxes of antiquities. These were originally intended to be transported to Shanghai with the second batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum, but since they were not loaded, they will be transported to Shanghai with the third batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum. According to Mr. Yang Xingfo, all antiquities will be exhibited in the new building built by the Academia Sinica on Brenan Road after they are all shipped to Shanghai.</p>

All members have worked hard to solicit donations. It has been reported that Mr. Chen Yizhou, a committee member, has already collected and submitted the donations. It is now known that Mr. Du Yuesheng, a committee member, believing that national crisis is imminent and that using aviation to save the country is of utmost importance, yesterday generously donated 5,000 yuan for the purchase of aircraft by Shanghai merchants, which has been received by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<h3>Today's Mediation of the Nanyang Tobacco Dispute</h3>
<p>In the case of workers of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company on Broadway assaulting employees, the arrested perpetrators have been sent to the court for trial. To prevent the dispute from escalating, the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting for labor and management representatives at 2:00 PM today to conduct mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau. The notices have already been issued yesterday.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Soliciting Donations Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued instructions to various public organizations yesterday: "It is hereby notified that a letter from the Public Security Bureau, Law No. 259, states: 'The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association has written to the Public Security Bureau stating that the association has entrusted major banks, newspapers, and legal public organizations in Shanghai and other ports to collect donations for the Northeast Volunteer Army, and has never sent anyone to solicit donations in public. Recently, it has been heard that some unscrupulous individuals are using the association's name to solicit donations from shops and residents, going door-to-door. Such fraudulent behavior will inevitably waste the money obtained on improper purposes. If not strictly prohibited, it will discourage patriotic and willing donors. Therefore, this bureau is requested to instruct various district offices that anyone soliciting donations in the name of the association is an imposter and should be severely punished according to the law to deter wrongdoers and maintain the rule of law, etc.' Approved. In addition to instructing all subordinates to comply with and pay attention to investigating and apprehending, a corresponding letter is hereby sent to you for your reference and for you to instruct various agricultural, commercial, and industrial organizations to be informed to avoid being deceived. This is hereby instructed. Approved. In addition to separate instructions, the association is hereby informed to instruct various associations that if the above-mentioned fraudulent donation solicitation occurs, the witnesses should be sent to the nearest police station for investigation and prosecution. This is hereby ordered."</p>
<p>Zhou Yiting</p>
<h3>Forensic Examination of a Death from Severe Injuries</h3>
<p>Zhou Yiting, also known as Lao Wu, a native of Nanjing who was responsible for distributing Shanghai's major and minor newspapers for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, was attacked with an axe by an assailant early yesterday morning around six o'clock. He sustained severe injuries to his head and shoulders as he left his residence and walked to the boundary road. The perpetrator managed to escape, and the police force was notified to send someone to the Renji Hospital for treatment. Zhou Yiting eventually died. His body was transported to the Forensic Examination Office on Feren Road. The details have already been published in yesterday's newspaper. This morning around ten o'clock, Guo Wei, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. The case was opened, and Zhou Li, the wife of the deceased, testified that she was 43 years old and that the deceased was her husband. She said that he was usually kind and did not have any grudges against anyone. She said that someone had previously given him trouble one or two years ago regarding newspaper matters and that she suspected that this incident was related. She added that she was still asleep at the time and was initially unaware of the unfortunate event. She requested justice and the release of the body. In addition, Hua Men, a Western investigator, reported the details of the investigation at the time and presented the axe and the damaged hat. Prosecutor Guo, having heard the testimonies, ordered that the body of Zhou Yiting was indeed severely injured by an axe to the head and shoulders, leading to death. The body was released to his wife, Zhou Li, who signed a document for its return for burial. The police will strictly investigate the perpetrator and bring them to justice. The axe will be temporarily held by the police for safekeeping.</p>
<p>North Suzhou Road</p>
<h3>Illegal Opium Pill Manufacturing Operation Busted</h3>
<p>Bai Fujin, a Chinese detective with the Shanghai Municipal Police, learned that someone was secretly manufacturing and selling opium pills at No. 7 North Suzhou Road. Yesterday morning at 6:50 AM, he led a team of Chinese detectives to raid the premises. They arrested Wang Qishan from Shanxi, who was involved in the manufacturing, and six accomplices: Wang Mingshou, Shi Chengfang, Fan Zhenhai, Hao Yonghua, and Song Anfu. They confiscated a large quantity of white pills and white powder and brought them back to the police station. This morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated the charges and requested a postponement because the confiscated pills needed to be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department for analysis of opium content. When questioned, Wang Qishan claimed that the pills were made from coffee extract and could be used as a smoking cessation product and not an opium substitute. The others were evasive. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Liu YuGui ordered Wang and the other six suspects to be detained for seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Thug Lu Chuanda Assassinated</h3>
<p>Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Two assassination attempts occurred in the area under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Police yesterday morning and evening. One was Zhou Yiting, also known as Lao Wu, a newspaper vendor on the railway lines, who was killed at the intersection of Shanqing Lane on the boundary road at 6:30 AM. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. The other involved Lu Chuanda, a local, who was suddenly attacked by three thugs with sharp blades and axes on Santai Road at 8:20 PM, sustaining injuries to his shoulders and legs. He was seriously injured and is currently being treated at Renji Hospital. It is understood that the victim, Lu Chuanda, is an unemployed thug who frequents tea houses and taverns in the Shanghai Municipal Police area. He is known for causing trouble and does not have a proper occupation. Yesterday afternoon around 6:00 PM, Lu had an argument with Li Acai, a native of Ningbo, over some matter, which escalated into a physical fight. The two were taken to the police station, where they were reprimanded by the police chief before being released. However, at 8:30 PM, Lu was walking on Santai Road when three thugs suddenly blocked his path. Each of them wielding axes, sharp blades, and handguns, they attacked Lu indiscriminately, resulting in severe injuries and heavy bleeding, causing him to collapse on the ground. The perpetrators fled. After being reported to the Shanghai Municipal Police, detectives Fang Qingyun and Bao Xiezhiguang were dispatched to investigate. They found Lu with a knife wound on his right shoulder and two axe wounds on his right leg, lying in a pool of blood. An axe was found nearby. Lu was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, and the axe was taken back to the police station. The investigation began, and around 11:00 PM, Li Acai and Xia Shangde, two suspects, were apprehended at No. 51 North Shanxi Road. Later, a third accomplice, Ni Shengfu, a local, was apprehended at No. 68 Santai Road. They were taken back to the police station and detained separately. This morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated the above circumstances, saying that the three defendants still needed to be investigated, so no charges had been filed and he requested detention. When questioned, Li Acai claimed that he had nothing to do with the incident, as Lu Chuanda had been his friend for several years and there was no animosity between them. He asserted that it was actually Lu's brother, Lu Touda, who committed the act and that he was being falsely accused. After Judge Liu YuGui reviewed the evidence, he ordered Li Acai and the other two suspects to be detained for seven days for further questioning after Lu Chuanda recovers from his injuries.</p>

<h3>What Do We Believe In?</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>"A nation exists between heaven and earth, it must have something to stand on." A nation's spirit, though not necessarily identical to other nations, must at least be consistent within itself. Japan's "Yamato spirit," England's "John Bull," the German national spirit, and the Soviet Union's socialist ideology, regardless of whether they are correct or blindly adopted, can all influence a nation's actions and compete on the international stage. But what central idea do we have to lead our people's struggle?</p>
<p>One might answer: "We believe in Heaven." "Relying on Heaven for food" is the only philosophy of the Chinese people. This is evident in everyday life and doesn't need to be sought in old books.</p>
<p>But if everyone "relies on Heaven for food," there wouldn't be much of a problem. Unfortunately, some people are unwilling to "rely on Heaven" and want to "act on behalf of Heaven." As a result, others who want to "rely on Heaven" find it difficult to "get food." This is truly not accidental.</p>
<p>The severity of the current national crisis is undeniable. But to find a way out of this crisis, we cannot rely on "Heaven." However, the idea of "relying on Heaven for food" is pervading society. Although I am not a pessimist, the facts tell me that I cannot be optimistic. The entire country is in a state of bewilderment and confusion. The conscious are a minority within a minority. The majority of the working masses have not yet reached a full understanding of themselves, while a portion of the petite bourgeoisie cleverly evades reality and their historical responsibilities, hiding in an "ivory tower." Therefore, we currently lack a central idea that can serve as a standard for our national actions. We have lost our support, our faith, and are simply living "aimlessly." All we have are idle hopes, such as hoping for an earthquake to strike the enemy, or a revolution to break out in the enemy country within ten years, and decadent ideas, such as saving the country through dancing, saving the country through beauty, etc. These are all applications of the "relying on Heaven" philosophy, which is a natural reaction from a hopeless people who have been stimulated.</p>
<p>But are we just going to wander aimlessly like this? No, there are still many who are asleep, but there are also those who are awake, waiting for an effort.</p>
<p>Wasn't it Napoleon who said, "There is a giant in the East, let him sleep, for when he wakes, he will shake the world." Indeed, we have a population of 400 million, and our potential is unimaginable. But whoever can use an idea to connect our fragmented hearts is worthy of greatness. It is better to die with purpose than to live lazily. It is better to sacrifice with purpose than to survive aimlessly. Rise up!</p>
<p>In conclusion, the survival of China depends on whether many people can have their hearts connected. The shaking of the world depends on what kind of idea connects the hearts of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>My Dream</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>According to scientific explanations, dreaming at night is a recurrence of daytime thoughts, or at least a result of being stimulated by moving environments. Therefore, dreams, originally an elusive and illusory state, are a kind of objective reaction. But since ancient times, there have been so-called "a dream of yellow millet" and "a dream of Nanke," the tone of which is completely unreal and缥缈. Even so, I wholeheartedly hope that my dream has some possibility of realization.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the dream of my private life: Naturally, individuals living in the modern era are closely connected with society. In other words, individual life is invariably dominated by the times, just as individuals are clumps of grass in the vast wilderness, and the times are storms in all directions. See how the movement of the grass is dominated by the storm. However, I must always grasp it and be a person in the modern era. Whether using my brain or strength, I must grit my teeth and seek life through labor. People who sit around and eat are not only not allowed by the times and will be on the decline, but also inevitably destroy the inherent abilities of mankind. Cattle and horses can provide labor, and even chickens and dogs, though they can only eat human food, also have their contributions to society.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have no inherited wealth, nor do I have connections with powerful relatives. And I am so clumsy by nature, unable to flatter or please, not used to bragging or buttering up. In short, I hate any kind of scheming in my life. So, to live and not suffer from cold or hunger, I must have my own way of grasping things. I only hope that from now on, I can increase my ability to endure hardship. This is the prerequisite guarantee that my private life can be resolved.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about society, which is so extensive that I can only extract the essence and briefly mention a few things:</p>
<p>I don't dream of a world of great harmony with no war, I only hope that future wars in the world, and even the operation of politics and the manipulation of economics, will gradually move towards a broader path.</p>
<p>I don't dream that the ruling class will completely stop exploiting, not want money, and that the common people will not have to fulfill their obligations or pay taxes. I only hope that under the beautiful name of abolishing exorbitant taxes, we don't repeat the famous couplet: "Never heard of taxes on manure since ancient times, only farts are not allowed to be donated today."</p>
<p>I don't dream that our country's higher education will be as effective as that of Britain and the United States, or that compulsory education will be as popular as that of Denmark. I only hope that every college student wearing a square hat can write a clear and fluent letter home, and that the number of illiterate people in the country will not increase to 100%.</p>
<p>I don't dream that our country is still the world's leading agricultural country, I only hope that from now on, we will no longer import food from abroad.</p>
<p>I don't dream that our country's industry will be as novel and widespread as that of Germany, I only hope that we can manufacture some of the pens that I am now holding to write with, so that I don't have to use these infuriating foreign goods anymore.</p>
<p>I don't dream that businessmen will rise up to resist enemy goods, I only hope that they will not secretly replace some domestic goods with enemy brands and sell them. When the anti-Japanese tension is high, they switch the enemy goods to domestic brands.</p>
<p>I don't dream that all doctors can cure all diseases, I only hope that they will not arbitrarily treat and kill people.</p>
<p>I don't dream that all 400 million of our compatriots will resist Japan, I only hope that the pro-Japanese traitors will not emerge endlessly, making foreigners laugh and harming our compatriots, that would be enough.</p>
<p>I don't dream that the tram will not increase prices when copper coins become cheaper, I only hope that when copper coins become more expensive, there will be a day when prices are reduced.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't dream that all my dreams can be realized, I only hope that there is some possibility of their realization.</p>

<h3>Poems of Transcendence (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qian Mengchao</p>
<p>In the hibiscus city, the immortals gather,</p>
<p>Discussing wind and moon, laughing and scolding as they please.</p>
<p>The immortal dream of the butterfly has not yet awakened,</p>
<p>Still offering the honorable title to the golden wheel.</p>
<p>Elections for movie queens amid national crisis</p>
<p>The dew plate is carried out, the moon is desolate,</p>
<p>The immortal family has its own way of escaping calamities.</p>
<p>The golden people bid farewell to the Han dynasty with sadness,</p>
<p>The declining orchids see them off, passing Xianyang.</p>
<p>The Southward Transport of Antiquities from the Palace Museum</p>
<p>The imperial proclamation flies from the heavenly gate of the North Pole,</p>
<p>The demon-subduing Xuanwu leads the mighty army.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand black banner tortoise and snake generals,</p>
<p>Dominating the wind and clouds at this moment.</p>
<p>Victory Reports from Generals Song Zheyuan, Guan Linzheng, Sun Dianying and Others</p>
<p>The imperial carriage and whirlwind chariot return to the imperial palace,</p>
<p>The immortals bow and gather in their crowns and robes.</p>
<p>Do not boast of the vastness of the universe within your sleeves,</p>
<p>Is there a Nüwa who can refine stones?</p>
<p>President Wang Returns to China</p>
<h3>Cannot Guess Their Psychology</h3>
<p>— Xiying</p>
<p>Every morning, rain or shine, on the tram, one always has the pleasure of appreciating the demeanor of a few female office workers. They bear the important responsibility of raising women's rights and implementing gender equality, so they would rather abandon their boudoirs and spend their lives as female office workers in the crowded market. They are not doing it for a meager monthly salary, nor do they deign to be called living advertisements or vases, new terms. Their sole purpose is to open up a new path for the women's community and give the men a head start. Therefore, they are often aloof and arrogant, and do not take any of the men in the world seriously. They seem to mean: even if we can't marry you smelly men, we don't have to worry about starving to death. We have the ability to support ourselves, but you can't find us as wives, so you have to get anxious! However, seeing them change their clothes every day and always apply red and white patches on their faces, one can't help but wonder whether they are specifically demonstrating to the men, or whether they are indicating that female office workers must be like this. At that time, I am afraid that they all hope to be favored by a rich man like the so-called ××× female郎 in ×× company, to be a lady with fur coat and pearls! After all, what they think in their hearts is something we cannot guess.</p>

<h3>Fleeting Moments in a Dream (Continued 10)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao arrives; it was indeed Lin Daping.</p>
<p>Young people, when they meet, are as easily blended as hot water and milk. Moreover, today they had a legitimate business to discuss, making their conversation even more lively. Lin Daping spoke the most, explaining the entire plan for establishing the record company as if he were telling a story, every word exceptionally pleasing to the ear.</p>
<p>"I will draft a contract tomorrow, and then we can formally begin!" After much idle talk, the lawyer Wang, well-versed in legal knowledge, decided on a concrete plan.</p>
<p>Wu Yi, being the most straightforward and quick-tongued of the lot, told Zhao Qianli everything about the matter in the editorial office that very night. Coincidentally, Zhao Qianli had been feeling down lately and wanted to find something to do for leisure, so he volunteered to Wu Yi, expressing his willingness to join their partnership.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>After the establishment of the "Great King Record Company," Wu Yi seemed like a changed man. He spent his free time lingering there. Not only was he no longer as financially strapped as he used to be, feeling like he was constantly preparing for New Year's Eve, but also mentally, he felt extremely comfortable, happy, and content.</p>
<p>"I have three of the best friends, they are all equally enthusiastic and loyal!" He once said proudly to someone, "Now, I am beginning to taste the true joy of making friends!"</p>
<p>(7) The Actress</p>
<p>One early winter morning, around ten o'clock, Wu Yi was lying quietly on a velvet sofa in the manager's office of the Great King Record Company, flipping through the day's newspapers. Because it was so early, neither Wang Yulin nor Zhao Qianli had arrived, and even Lin Daping, the manager, had not yet made his appearance.</p>
<p>"Excuse me! Is Mr. Lin at home?" Wu Yi was studying a telegram from Army A denouncing Army B, much like one would study ancient texts, when suddenly, the small door with opaque glass opened halfway. In a strong scent of perfume essence, a beautiful woman, tall and graceful, with picturesque eyebrows and eyes, walked in. Instantly, the room brightened as if a five-hundred-candlepower electric light had been turned on, almost blinding Wu Yi.</p>
<p>In the previous years, Wu Yi had clashed with the fairer sex over a thousand times, and images of women had almost filled his brain. However, this one before him truly possessed a wonderful demeanor he had never seen in his life. Especially when she smiled, the two dimples on her cheeks, like being molded from powder and carved from jade, almost made him wonder if he was dreaming!</p>
<p>"He hasn't arrived yet, but he might be here soon," Wu Yi stood up and replied politely.</p>
<p>"Then... would it be possible for me to wait here for a while?" This young lady was not only beautiful but also wonderfully generous. She slightly bent one leg forward, performed a curtsy commonly used by noblewomen in the seventeenth century, and briskly removed a fur-collared cloak, revealing a pure black dress.</p>
