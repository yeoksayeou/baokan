<h3 id="c24">我國經濟當前之病象 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>衛·</p>
<p>百年以還。長處於江河日下過程中之我國經濟。迄於今日。實已瀕於最後之絶境。而此一問題。則又實爲縱横錯雜羅列於我人當前之一切問題之根本。亦即爲一切動亂之根源。中國如欲安内。而於此造成動亂造成國難之根本問題。不先亟謀所以挽救之策。則實未見其可。</p>
<p>吾人試一檢查我國經濟當前之病象。當不能不駭然於我國之痼疾已深。險症畢呈。幾於無可挽救。誠然、經濟恐慌。今已成爲資本主義世界普遍之現象。非中國所獨有。然而中國之恐慌。則實與資本主義列强各異其質。不可同日並論。質言之。即資本主義列强之恐慌。爲由於過剩。而我國之恐慌。則爲由於帝國主義之侵略。由於不足也。</p>
<p>今日我國經濟之病象。大體言之。則爲農村經濟加速崩潰。爲人民購買力加速降落。爲金融之不自然的集中都市。爲工商業之零落凋敝。此種種之病象。雖以綂計之不完全。吾人無以窺見其全景。然其由於多方面之反證。要亦可以覘知其一斑。</p>
<p>此多方面之反證爲何。第一就對外貿易而觀。去年進口總值爲十萬四千九百二十四萬六千六百六十一海關兩。較之前年減少三萬八千四百二十四萬二千五百三十三海關兩。出口總值去年爲四萬九千二百六十四萬一千四百二十一海關兩。較之前年亦激減四萬一千六百八十三萬四千一百零四海關兩。而在進口貨物之中。農産品則仍佔最鉅大之數目。以價值計。去年度爲三萬四千八百五十九萬一千九百四十一海關兩。就中尤以米麥麵粉棉花幾種主要農業品爲大宗。至於出口貨物中。則生絲茶葉桐油蛋等又無不顯形慘跌。由此一事實。吾人即可以覘知我國農産之衰落。與資本主義經濟對我猛烈侵略之大概。</p>
<p>再就人民購買力之加速低降一點而觀。據最近發表之中國銀行二十一度營業報告書所載。中等農民之儲蓄不過一二十元。其下者竟至求一元之現金而不可得。有植桑之户。竟不能育蠶。問其故。則曰不得一元以購蠶種。又有農民以一牛求押十元而不可得。農民購買力之低降。於此已可概見。至於都市。即就上海而言。商號營業者。去年即較前年減少三分之一。今年尤甚。由商號之倒閉。則又可反證都市人民購買力之降低。人民普遍之購買力。旣如此低落。國民經濟。尚堪問乎。</p>
<p>總之、吾國經濟今日已百孔千瘡。瀕於絶境。上述之種種。不過爲其最顯著之數端。在整個世界經濟恐慌之狂潮中。來日大難。正方興未艾。吾人今日而言安内。則此一最嚴重之根本問題。絶對不能忽視。否則緣木求魚。恐更足增抱薪救火之象耳。</p>

<p>非法佔取碼頭　在一九三二年七月七日、「僞國」當局擢取哈爾濱之中東路碼頭、次日蘇聯政府曾通知日政府、謂此種行動係由「僞國」所雇日人直接指導之、此事損害中東路之利益、惟至今尚未解决、在本年四月十一日、日軍佔據碼頭辦事處、豎立日本旗、且以日軍站崗、縱使以前各種非法行爲係出於「僞國」、今則日當局已佔取尚在交涉中之碼頭、對於此種行爲、蘇聯不能不加以抗議、　　積欠巨額運費　蘇聯政府曾允日政府之請、在中東路載運日軍、事前係約定照期付運費、故認此爲純粹商業性質、惟中東路與日當局交涉付費問題、被加以有計劃之拖延、至今積欠已成巨額、而增重該路之經濟困難、蓋因滿洲之軍事行動、該路商運已大受影響也、</p>
<p>破壞歐亞交通　蘇聯政府對於滿洲最近事態之最爲震驚者、乃因滿方日員之直接命令及參加、由警務當局爲接連之强制行爲、以破壞中東路之常態工作、造成蘇聯利益之嚴重損失、如截斷中東路與外貝加爾鐵道相接之路軌、損害蘇聯通車至中東路之權利、障碍歐亞交通、及攫取蘇聯運出之貨物等等、現中東路之東段、已因有系綂之攻擊車輛、及暗殺綁刦被雇於該路之蘇聯人民、而陷於完全無組織之狀態、日政府保證謂彼方運軍於該路、以恢復其秩序、惟實際目前該路之秩序與安全、較前更不如云　　扣車全無錯誤　關於爭議中之機頭及車輛之問題、加氏宣稱、蘇聯政府在此事全無錯誤、機頭爲蘇聯之財産、自始即不屬於中東路、至於車輛、現蘇聯車輛在中東路者達二千節、超過中東路在蘇聯之車輛數、其交換歸還之稽延、係由於中國軍隊與日「滿」軍隊發生軍事衝突之故、</p>
<p>俄人備受虐待　加氏乃再抗議蘇聯人民之大批被捕、謂「其中大部分已被拘禁年餘、未受審判、且遭日憲兵與「滿洲國」所雇日人之異常虐待、此種事實、當然尚非侵害蘇聯利益事實之全部、惟蘇聯政府已不得不提醒日政府以前所作保證、并要求以有效之辦法、切實保障蘇聯之利益、」</p>
<p>要求迅即答覆　加氏於結語中請求日大使作迅速之答復、太田允即將加氏之意見轉達日政府、同時加氏再以關於最近爭議中之機頭車輛問題之一備忘錄、交於太田、（十八日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>日本擬置不理　（東京）蘇俄政府當局關於中東路事件、向日駐俄大使提出長文通牒、外務省現尚未接其通牒、未知其内容如何、若係關於中東路問題之對日抗議文、則日本因認該問題爲「僞國」與俄方之問題、與日無關係、擬將該抗議一蹴不理、若係請求日本調停者、則可考慮相當辦法云、（十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>否認操縱白俄　（東京）駐日蘇聯大使今日往日外交部訪内田外長、與日接洽口東路之糾紛問題、據傳蘇聯大使對於日政府累次嗾使僞組織向俄挑撥、殊表不滿、蘇聯深望以和平手叚解决糾紛、並謂日本即時停止操縱白俄之反蘇聯工作、否則於兩國外交上實堪憂慮、内田外長答謂、中東路問題日方亦希望和平解决、但事關「僞國」問題、日本不能單獨作主、至於利用白俄並無其事、日外部根據遠東和平、願繼續與蘇聯接洽云、（十八日華聯電）</p>
<p>僞國狐假虎威　（哈爾濱）蘇聯方面主張機車之所有權、惟此機車、雖係克萊斯基政府時代、向美國訂購適蘇俄大革命勃發、美國乃未交蘇俄、交於反蘇俄方面、而工廠設備費及裝置費、皆由中東路支付、故實際乃爲中東路所有、今蘇俄方面旣無何等通告、開入俄領、顯係侵害「僞國」之主權、「僞國」準備徹底糾彈之並表示强硬之决意、在損害未解决前、無論如何交涉概不應諾、（電通電）</p>
<p>（長春）（僞）交通部對於東鐵問題蘇俄政府　日所提之抗議、將發反駁之回答指摘其無理由、并對於蘇俄方面之任意運去貨車、是類之不法行爲、將提嚴重之抗議、該抗議書將於今日由東鐵督辦李紹庚交與柯兹耐托夫、（十八日電通電）</p>
<p>日垂涎中東路　（東京）日報稱、聞可恃方面之消息、今日接到哈爾濱電訊、蘇俄現準備將其在中東鐵路之利益、售日金一萬萬元、聞某要人刻在哈爾濱與「滿洲國」當局磋商蘇俄利益出售事、今日陸軍省發言人否認知有此事、並發半滑稽之言、謂「倘此說果確、「滿洲國」亦力不足以購此、蘇俄如欲出售其利益、須將售價减低」云、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>記者旋詢平津之民氣、以及社會情形等、據王女士答、平津一帶地方平安、市情依舊、平市商業或且較以前旺盛、其民情之安逸平靜、實非始料所及、蓋兩地距長城各口不及數百里、在此數小時路程之外、民族戰爭如是激烈、而該處人民尚能安居樂業、旣不驚慌、又不緊張、此種情形、實使人詫異、但津市自于學忠任職後、日軍之惡意挑釁行爲、已漸歛跡、日租界澈夜通行、地方亦寗靜云、</p>

<p>在四月五日，申報讀者顧問欄，有尤懷　先生對於雄聲君「農村回得去嗎」的討論復信，我讀後感到非常的失望，尤先生的答復不但不中肯，並且是極危險的，首先是顚倒事實，其次是將問題非現實化，成爲烏托邦，極力逃避現實，他說「我（尤先生）覺得在國難臨頭的時節，眼見都市中醉生夢死的生活，到不如覓一幽靜可愛的鄉村去另謀出路，憑我能力可及，用十年的工夫，來建設一個意想中的新式桃花源，」這完全表現出尤先生對於現社會的不了解，尤其是「農村裏」不然他不會說出這樣的話，我們現在對於理論上暫且不談，單就事實來說罷，成千成萬的農人們，離鄉背井，不斷的向都市裏走，這是他們不「愛好鄉村」嗎，不愛他們「鄉村中的農友」（親戚）嗎，或是他們「不堅决任勞在鄉村中尋生活」嗎（這是尤先生「到鄉村去的先决條件」）不是的，不是的，完全是因他們不能在鄉村中活下去，很平常的活去，！他們爲什麽不能在鄉村中活下去，這是現社會的問題，同我們不能在都市生活是一樣的，那末「農村裏回得去嗎」的問題，是很明白的解答了，旣然農村，都市都没有我們活的路，我們到何處去呢，自殺嗎，坐以待斃嗎，當然是不願意的，那末，還有路可走麽，有的，就是積極的爲我們生存而奮鬥，爲生存而奮鬥，不是空談可以辦到的，也不是「憑我（個人）能力可及」的，（個人的力量在現社會是非常薄弱的，是大多數不能生存，偏要生存的人，共同奮鬥，才能達到的！主要是解决現社會制度下的矛盾，這樣我們才能生存下去，不但農村，就是都市，也有我們活的路，</p>
<p>（十三）本埠偉浩君來信！爲農村問題與尤懷臯先生商榷</p>
<p>看了尤君的信，才知道尤君原來是一個空想家，他說的到鄉村去的先决條件，（一）你是否愛好農村，關于這一點，很有些疑問，雄聲君本來是農村中人，爲生活乃不得不投身到都市裏來，現在爲了失業乃又打算回到農村裏去，事實告訴我們，在目前這樣的制度之下，唯一的希望是生活的安定，而不是什麽愛好不愛好的問題，祇要那裏能生活，都市也好，農村也好的，（二）你是否眞心愛你的鄉村中的農友，關于這一點，雄聲君眞心愛與不眞心愛我却不得而知，然而雄聲君已經表示，「都市，没有什麽不使我留戀的地方」當然他祗有跳出這都市，而走入鄉村，農民與其一無怨尤，自亦没有不愛的道理，不過眞心愛了農友而生活並不能得着解决，那也怎麽樣呢，至于鄉村中的好處（一）（二）兩點，差可人意，而（三）生活自由一點，這是尤君的夢想，事實上何常比城中好些呢，土豪劣紳的權威隨時都能使農民痛苦呻吟而不敢作聲，鄉中苦處一層，誠然在物質方面是不能得到充分的享用，然而以一個赤貧者生活于都市裏，又怎能受到物質的享用呢，况且雄聲君正在失業，生活尚發生問題，享用自也談不到，尤君又說久居城的人，或要感到枯寂無聊的少趣，這一點不是爲雄聲君着想，而是爲兩個生活富裕的人們深思吧，尤君以爲「在這國難臨頭時節，倒不如覓一幽靜可愛的鄉村去另謀出路，用十年的功夫，來建設一個意想中的新式桃花源」尤君簡直不是替雄聲君解决疑難，而是爲自已作理想文章，試問農村破産的目前，以一個赤手空拳的雄聲君，從何建設起什麽，「新式桃花源，」尤君實在太聰明了，以爲國難臨頭的現在，祗有逃到鄉村裏建設桃花源才有辦法，那末現在東北四省的受苦同胞該都有了出路了，更不致遭受日帝國主義的屠殺了吧，尤君說「城市中缺的是食品及物料，這是鄉村中能供給的，」不錯，鄉村中的生産足夠供給城市的需要，然而自從資本主義到了中國毒入農村之後，不但城市中缺的，不必仰給于農村，就是目前的農村，正也給資本主義搗得不成樣兒了哩，談到尤君爲雄聲君第一步施敎的辦法，内容看來，倒也不差，可是以雄聲君的赤貧，籌措一二百元實在也不易，况且全中國農村經濟破産的年頭裏，農民的先决問題！生活，尚得不着解决，使其子女受敎育，據我所知，簡直辦不到，况且還要學費和讀書難，那更加是難事了，倘雄聲君是一個有錢的人，像這樣的虧本生意經，或者還好當消遣來頑頑的，尤君的第二步辦法也不差，可是第一步辦法不行，那第二步辦法，處目前天災人禍苛徵暴歛的混亂局面之下，更幹也不會有結果的，尤君的第三步辦法，是行醫賣藥，關于這一點，有上海市衛生局的醫生登記綂計，可以說明是不成功的事，近兩年來，上海的醫生過剩，原因却是内地無以謀生而投到上海來的太多，那末以雄聲君對于醫藥外行的人，到鄉村去又有什麽把握呢，尤君的空想不切實際，終致于有第四步的「進行村治的工作」的理想了，我以爲前三條簡直没有辦法，第四條就無從根據，但尤君熱心主張鄉村敎育救國論，不知内容如何，深盼尤君能與吾人以一讀大論的機會，最後依我個人的意見，以爲雄聲君在都市中失業和回到農村裏去，一樣是没有辦法的　　更正　本欄四月十七日劉君信末倒數第十三行「要走上這二條路」「二」字，係「一」字之誤，特此更正。</p>

<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>昨夜在新雅酒家，同闊别了三年的同學駿少猷，酒酣耳熱，我聽見了他幾句關於世態人情悲憤的話。他這樣說：啊我從前在學校的時光，自已年紀很輕，什麽都覺得有希望，光明幸福像兩盞明燈照在我眼前，同時家境也好，許多親戚朋友都親熱着。但自前年因了家庭多變，我雙親相繼逝世後，所有産業在幾度變故中零落殆盡，於是那些親友都疏遠了。當人家有求於我的時光，我曾經盡力之所及儘量供給人家，覺得人類應該互助的，那時人家都來諛言趨奉，現在我需要人家相助的時光，却好像相約着般悄然疏遠我了。我還是以前的我，人家對我却完全兩樣，現現在明白了人家當時的諛言趨奉，不是對於我的人</p>
<p>，不過是希望遂願他們物質上的帮助而已，物質上的帮助絶望</p>
<p>也不來諛言趨奉了，我現在得了一個新的經騐與敎訓：人類是</p>
<p>的，只是利害的結合而已。</p>
<p>我聽了他的話，覺得在勢利的時代，什麽地方都暴露了人情冷暖，世態炎凉，已經成功一個普遍現象了，對於人類是没有互助，只是利害的結合的話，尤沉痛而確切，利害所在，趨炎附勢，奸詭幻議，雖家庭骨肉，也會衝突决裂起來，親友更無論了。這也是世道人心的轉變吧！</p>
<h3 id="c173">做一行怨一行 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>「做一行，怨一行」，老子做了一世剃頭，扞脚；總指望兒子最低限度得做一個泥水木匠。可是兒子果然學了泥水木匠，總希望下一世不要再做老本行，還是搖舢板，拉洋車，來得夠味。</p>
<p>四喜肉發明家蘇東坡老先生的浴兒詩裏有這麽二句，「但願生兒愚且魯，無災無難到公卿」。像蘇東老這麽一位大亨，尚且做官做得怨聲載道，希望公子少爺，愚而且魯，不要像老子一樣，活活表現出「做一行，怨一行」的嘴臉。所謂「無災無難到公卿」也者，不過三句不離本行，說說而已，試想智而且慧的蘇東老，尚且有三十六災，七十二難，若是愚而且魯，還有指望做公卿麽？所以有一位文學大家說，「不像爺，不像娘，像了隔壁老皮匠」，這是蘇東老心坎兒裏的話，不過不便形諸筆墨，所以故意佈一個疑陣，讓後人在裏面翻跟斗。「然而」，「不然」，起承轉合，話又得說回來。有許多，是例外的。</p>
<p>例如老子是「眞命天子」，雖然這位天子已到了「掩淚出宮」，「煤山上吊」的地步，總没有不希望兒子努力中興，重振舊業，再登龍位的。所以我們的阿弟哥溥儀，雖做了大清一脈相傳的末代皇帝，兀是拚命的要做傀儡大皇帝。還有做盜賊也不會「做一行，怨一行」的。强盜被解往西砲臺槍斃，吃飽了酒肉，還要高喊着「二十年後，又是一條好漢」，可知做强盜，同做皇帝一樣的夠味。</p>
<p>「龍生龍，鳳生鳳，賊養兒子掘壁洞」，「衣钵相傳」，「箕裘克紹」的，惟帝王與盜賊。此外不拘是學武賣拳頭，學文賣筆頭，「吃不飽，餓得死」，總不免「做一行，怨一行」。</p>

<p>— 張亦菴</p>
<p>對於摩登，我並不反對，因爲摩登不過是英語Modern的譯音，在幾百年前早已有了的字，原意就是現代的，近代的；若作名詞用，則當作現代的人，有現代思想的人。我們旣生爲現代的人，事實上已經是摩登了，何必多辨？有些人給這兩個望文而不可生義的字一嚇，便給迷住了，於是摩登一詞，在中國幾乎獨立地别成一義。在他們看來，摩登也者，不特是「新派」的，而且含有多少神秘性和浪漫性，而且對於女子似乎更有關係。一提到摩登兩字，心目中便活現出一位剪髮而且燙卷了的，塗了唇紅，薙去了眉毛而重新繪上人工的兩筆，挺出大奶奶，窄袖長裾，高跟皮鞋裏揷着一雙外裏絲襪的小腿的女子。而這樣的女性也未嘗不以爲即此便是摩登，至多再加上一些裝飾性的技巧，如跳舞術，說幾句最通用的英語等。我以爲現代的一切，由政治以至於衛生紙丨只要是國貨丨都應該摩登。女性要摩登，這更是理所當然。眞正摩登的女性，至少要懂得怎樣做一個有益於家庭的主婦，怎樣去做一個有益於兒女的母親，怎樣去做一個有益於社會的人物。這些都得用最摩登的方法。如果只理會得裝飾和社交，則眞是不足以語於摩登之道也。</p>
<p>自摩登一詞風行，市上遂有假借此名以爲投機者，無異於往昔之利用「曲線美」，「模特兒」，「肉感」等以牟利。心中頗覺不安，所以來說幾句。</p>

<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>紅豆生兩國，春來發幾枝，願君多采擷·此物最相思。」唐人的一首小詩，却把紅豆的價值抬高了，常熟錢牧齋的紅豆山莊，尤爲膾炙人口，我蘇南禪寺有一株，相傳爲宋白鴿禪師所手植，現已枯萎了，白馬澗的天池山·寂鑑寺後有一顆很大的紅豆樹，若干年結實一次，寺僧把纍纍的紅豆，收藏起來，饋贈檀越，聊博香金，那些佞佛的老嫗，往往把它鑲嵌爲簪，插在頭上，說是可以避邪，又葑門吳衙塲仁興典當内的一株，是洪楊以前物，該當爲烏鎭徐氏所設，其址本敝戚彭氏産，洪楊亂離的時候，彭柏雲公因乏資用，就把這屋讓給人家，這一株紅豆樹，幹粗合抱，斜枝出牆，遮及鄰家的屋檐，故結實的時候，往往因風吹墮，鄰家得着意外的收貯。</p>
<p>荆人奩中，有紅豆一枚，即天池山産品，鶴兒出世，就把它鑲成飾物，繫在腕間，不料鶴兒穉齒初茁，便遭囓損，鄙人當時撰了篇「一顆很可惜的紅豆」一文，刊諸某報，我友顧君明道瞧見了，慨然把他所藏的兩顆南洋羣島所産的紅豆，分一枚由郵投貽，那枚紅豆色澤鮮艷，且有寳光；鄙人什襲珍藏，視爲環寳，</p>
<p>趙君震初自平望來，看見鄙人的一枚紅豆，說起平望鎭上的源來南貨店，庭院中有鐵樹一顆，鐵樹便是紅豆樹的俗名，這樹雖柯葉秀茂，但是始終没有結實過，直至去年秋間，忽然纍纍的結起實來，擷之約得若干升，今春猶得分貽戚友，據聞顆粒很大，色澤也很可愛呢？</p>

<p>還有油鹽店裏的錢，劈柴店裏的錢，絨線店裏的錢，平常不賒欠，人家是天大的面子，賒了賬了。到了現在也不好意思不給人家，由一早起，慢慢的應付着債户，到了下午三四點鐘，天色快黑了，還有兩筆賬没給。一筆是挑水夫的錢，不到一塊，一筆是燒餅店裏的錢，連吃燒餅，帶借麵粉，也有兩塊錢怎好不給。但是籌來的現欵，都付光了，這兩筆錢怎付得出呢？那個挑水夫，一下午來了三趙，那還罷了。最麻煩不過的，就是這燒餅店裏的小徒弟，一會兒來一次，簡直數不清次數了。最後他站在院子裏道；我們掌櫃的說，你們到底給錢不給錢？你們要是再不給的話，我就在這裏等着，不回去了。桂枝是個年輕的人，究竟愛惜幾分面子，就對江氏道：反正也不過兩三塊錢的事，何必讓這小子在院子裏嚷着。咱們檢兩件衣服去當幾塊錢，把這兩個債主予開銷掉了吧？江氏道：棉衣服都穿着呢，單衣服夾衣服又不值錢。桂枝道：把我身上這件旗袍脫下來罷，我穿短襖子得了。您穿那件薄棉襖得了，那件破皮襖，也可以拿去當一當。咱們睡暖坑，娘兒俩蓋一條被得了，褥子也可以拿去。合起來，總可以寫二兩多銀子。江氏想了一想，點着頭道：也除非是那樣辦。於是桂枝一點也不躊躇，把衣服換了。將褥子由被底抽出來，將兩件衣服一捲，捲了一個大包，夾在脇下，走到院子裏，指着那小徒弟道：你等着罷。不過該你兩三塊錢，這就至於逼死人嗎？說着，氣怱怱的就到當鋪裏來。這海甸小小的鎭市上，倒有一家當鋪。在這過年的時候，生意也跟别家店一樣，十分的興旺。桂枝走到店裏，將東西向櫃上一推，伙計一看這些東西，知道就是一個苦主顧，因爲那衣服還是暖和的呢。（四六）</p>

<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>凡事澈底是好的，而「透底」就不見得高明。因爲連續的向左轉，結果碰見了向右轉的朋友，那時候彼此點頭會意，臉上會要辣辣的。要自由的人，忽然要保障復辟的自由，或者屠殺大衆的自由，丨丨透底是透底的了，却連自由的本身也漏掉了，原來只剩得一個無底洞。</p>
<p>譬如反對八股是極應該的。八股原是蠢笨的産物。一來，是考官嫌麻煩丨他們的頭腦大半是陰沉木做的。丨丨甚麽代聖賢立言，甚麽起承轉合，文章氣韵，都没有一定的標準，難以捉摸，因此，一股一股地定出來，算是合於功令的格式，用這格式來「衡文」，一眼就看得出多少輕重。二來，連應試的人也覺得很省力，又不費事了。這樣的八股，無論新舊，都應當掃蕩。但是，這是爲着要聰明，不是要更蠢笨些。</p>
<p>不過要保存蠢笨的人，却有一種策略。他們說：「我不行，而他和我一樣」丨大家活不成，拉倒大吉！而等「他」拉倒之後，舊的蠢笨的「我」却總是偷偷地又站起來，實惠是屬於蠢笨的。好比要打倒偶像，偶像急了，就指着一切活人說，「他們都像我」，於是你跑去把貌似偶像的活人，綂綂打倒；回來，偶像會讀賞一番，說打倒偶像而打倒「打倒」者，確是透底之至。其實，這時候更大的蠢笨，籠罩了全世界。</p>
<p>開口詩云予曰，這是老八股；而有人把「達爾文說，蒲力汗諾夫曰」也算做新八股。於是要知道地球是圓的，人人都要自已去環遊地球一週；要製造汽機的，也要先坐在開水壺前格物。：這自然透底之極。其實，從前反對衛道文學，原是說那樣喫人的「道」不應該衛，而有人要透底，就說什麽道也不衛；這「什麽道也不衛」難道不也是一種「道」嗎？所以，眞正是透底的，還是下列的一個故事：</p>
<p>古時候一個國度裏革命了，舊的政府倒下去，新的站上來。旁人說，「你這革命黨，原先是反對有政府主義的，怎麽自已又來做政府」？那革命黨立刻拔出劍來，割下了自已的頭；但是，他的身體並不倒，而變成了僵尸，直立着，喉管裏吞吞吐吐地似乎是說：這主義的實現原本要等三千年之後呢。</p>

<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>放下電話的聽筒，他没有法兒再抑住臉上肌肉的顫動，没有法兒掩住灰白的臉色了。向眼前幾個人支吾了幾句，就走出這米行的經理室，本來想對賬房裏幾個人吩咐些話的，現在也嚥了下去。一脚跨上包車，只向車夫阿二揮揮手，也没有心緒開口了。</p>
<p>「上海有電報，事情糟糕啦。」他的心裏只響着這句話。仲春的天氣，太陽輝惶地抹在他身上，但他覺得全身給人家灑了冷水似的，一陣陣冷得怪難受。車夫拉着的回聲，像平日一樣傲慢地響着，他自已也下意識地踏着脚鈴；可是他面前一切的東西，在他看來，似乎都在坍倒了。他覺得自已坐在包車上，也不夠平日那樣的威風了。</p>
<p>他恍恍怱怱地想着，車子倒好像拉得比平時快，已經停在自家門口。走上客廳，老周等得滿是不耐煩的神氣。「怎麽樣糟？」他問，眼睛發着光。</p>
<p>「做的標金和花紗都跌了，一共三十四萬，市塲上變化太大，我們到底還夠不上的。」那一個搖着頭。</p>
<p>「那麽還來牠一下，一不做二不休的，管不得許多。」他心裏湧起了一種反感。</p>
<p>「不成啦，照現在的情形，我們手頭已經掉不轉了，再做，我不幹。我倒看穿了，手面大的人可以把我們作弄，我們這些小資本的就只能在他們手上打筋斗。這一回的變化我完全看明白了。」　　他噤住着。這幾句話把他的勇氣冷了下去。跟老周兩個人對分，每人虧上十七萬，除去繳過的五萬保證金，還得要十二萬咧。把眼睛看看老周，老周的長方臉也緊張着，他又低下頭滿肚子的籌算了。米行和綢莊的資本，正好是十二萬。祖先丢下的家産，他十幾年的經營，就這麽一下子完了；他在這城市中的傲慢和威風，也這麽一下子完了。他也在心裏暗暗地埋怨自已，不應該幹這種事苦了自已，可是他又立刻給自已辯護，除了這個就没有再痛快的事了，都市正伸着引誘人們的手啊，他怎會知道有大資産的在作弄呢。</p>
<p>「你知道嗎？那些大户頭的後臺老閭是外國人啦，仔細想想眞傷心，中國人的事情什麽都握在外國人手裏。」老周打破了沉默。</p>
<p>「你總不至於掏空腰包的吧？我是完了。」他搖着頭，仿彿看見自已的米行和綢莊，給别人盤了去，甚至包車的回聲，拉起來也不像先前一樣的響亮了。　　偶然一陣春風吹到他臉上，他深深地呼了一口氣。</p>

<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>一，船上</p>
<p>家裏的那幾間小屋子已經空鎖了八年了丨我是那麽地懷念着家鄉呵丨院子裏的那顆橘樹；那幾盆種在庭前的山茶花，馬蘭花；那陰暗的紙窗：門前那池塘裏的綠苔：時常從我心裏邊引起一種淡淡的思戀的。這一次春假，父親硬要我跟着伯父回去掃墓，他說：</p>
<p>「再不回去，怕連祖宗的墳墓你也認不得了，葉落歸根，將來總有一天要回去的。」</p>
<p>我才明白，這是遺傳的，種族的懷鄉病，便提了隻小提箱，帶了支手杖，跳上了輪船，和一個輕快的靈魂一同地。　　那天的船擠得了不得，到處那躺着人。那麽多的人呵丨他們全講着親切的鄉語；他們用頂俚俗的話駡人；他們都是質樸的，天眞的大孩子；他們愛說土話，愛吹牛皮；於是我便望着他們笑，我高興，因爲我們的同鄉是慣說土話，吹牛皮，用各種誰也想像不出的字眼來駡人的。有時候他們的牛皮會吹得連自個兒都信不過來；他們會駡得連自家兒也忍不住笑勁兒丨他們都是些可愛的人呵丨他們是和我在同一的泥土裏生長的；他們是吃魚和鹽的民族，我也是吃魚和鹽的人。</p>
<p>開船的時候，我靠着甲板上的鐵欄，望着江水裏的雲影，做着家鄉的夢。船頭慢慢兒的横開來，聽着江水泊泊地敲着船舷，便丨「再會吧，上海丨我們的家鄉是魚和鹽之國，我們的家鄉那兒有眞的澄澈的藍天，青的水，白的雲；我們的家鄉是那麽地素樸的國土呵丨我們是回家鄉去的丨」那麽地想着。</p>
<p>高建築物的天線伸展着，永遠伸展着，可是慢慢兒的江海關的風旗不見了，鐘也不見了，沙遜大厦的金頂也不見了，接着便是數不清的棧房，一點點的大起來，又一點點的小下去，小下去。水電廠的一大堆高烟囱小到一束鉛筆似的丨出了吳淞口，第一陣海風把我的頭髮吹了起來時，便輕輕地喊着：「去吧，上海丨」我是醉了。</p>
<p>晚上浪大得利害，碰碰地撞着船底，我靜靜地躺在床上看紗窗簾的那條絲縧的擺動，怎麽也睡不着。我怎麽能睡得着呢？天亮的時候，我便到了故鄉了。　　早上四點鐘的時候，我悄悄地爬了起來，抽上了一支烟，偷偷地跑到甲板上去。望過去全是無邊無際的藍水，在那望不盡的水面上，燈塔的光浮着，直照多遠，跟着海浪飄動着，一回兒没了，一回兒又現了出來。我望着這燈塔發怔，這是比年紅燈還美麗的，人生那麽地變幻着，又是人生那麽地一個單調的循環。不知道多　起的，水平線那兒有了土地的黑線，在那灰暗的晨光裏。慢慢兒的那黑線近了，清楚起來了，我看得見那上面的樹，田，和遠處的山影。忽然我瘋了似的跳起來，掙扎了半天又坐到帆布椅上，「到了丨那就是我的家鄉呵丨」那麽地太息着。</p>

<p>— 六曾</p>
<p>兩個外國人似乎有點狼狽了。這狽狼的情形，我是很能體味得到的。一年以前，和妻一道在異國的小城市或鄉下旅行時，不也常被許多人看得厭煩嗎？</p>
<p>大概因爲車中祇有我穿着洋服的緣故罷，兩個外國人像是早在等着我回過頭來。我們的視線一碰到，外國人之一便用英語問我：</p>
<p>「閔行就在前面嗎？」</p>
<p>「請用中國話問我罷。我不會說英國話。」在歐洲的幾年，看見許多英國人，不論在什麽國家，一遇到黄種人，尤其是中國人，便不問青紅皂白，毫無禮貌地，拿英國話對你　上直嘖，好像中國人都受過他們的殖民地敎育，都應該能說幾句英國話似的，這事使我抱了很深的反感，每逢英美人拿自已做「高等華人」看待，用英語來攀談時，我便立即拿這樣的話回擲過去。</p>
<p>「你這不就是說的英國話嗎？」另一個外國人笑了。</p>
<p>「我只會說這一句。」我也笑了。「如果你們能說法國話，請用法國話談罷。那麽大家都便當一點。」</p>
<p>凡是受過大學敎育的英美青年，大都能說幾句法語的。於是兩個外國人用勉强可以達意的法語和我交談着。</p>
<p>這是兩位加拿大的青年游歷家。他們預備在上海住一兩個月。他們打聽得閔行離上海很近，他們要去頑半天，想看到點新奇的東西。外國人是很好奇的。　　「你也到閔行去嗎？」一個外國人望着我手上的花束問。</p>
<p>「不，我就在這裏下車。」</p>
<p>「你的家住在這裏嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>汽車恰好就在這時停住了，司機人高呌着：「ＸＸ公墓」。</p>
<p>「這兒不是單單祇有一個墓場嗎」？外國人之一睜大着眼睛問。</p>
<p>「是的。但我的女人住在這兒。」我握着花束招呼着下了車。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>在管墓人的「先生又來了」的歡呼聲中，我走進了墓塲。</p>
<p>這兒現在是妻的家，也就是自已將來的家啊。妻安眠着的地方，旁邊不是留着一塊空地嗎？</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>李一香似乎想笑，但又不便笑出來的神氣。</p>
<p>「今天那種游行的情形眞是悲壯呀！眞可以寒帝國主義者丨丨我們的敵人之膽丨他害怕，不敢參加呢！哈！哈！哈！」</p>
<p>李一香這趟指着陳華民，哈哈地大笑起來了。</p>
<p>「：：：那些小孩子們的膽量，還是差了一點，没有訓練好。幸得我們勉勵了他們一番。：：：成績總算不錯。今天的成績總算不錯。：：：是不是，密司脫林？」</p>
<p>李一香說到最後，翻過頭來問了海泉一聲。海泉想，何以李一香竟那樣的不客氣，當面吹牛起來呢。好在自已從頭至尾都在塲，目擊了示威游行的情形。李一香只是點點這些没有參加示威運動的同道人而已。但他還是無可奈何，唯有點一點頭，表示肯定了。</p>
<p>「現在我們是要想辦法營救他們被捕的。：：：」</p>
<p>經陳華民這樣地說了後，全客堂又是鴉雀無聲了。</p>
<p>海泉好幾次想問問李一香今天爲什麽帶了一本新舊約全書去參加示威運動？他覺得這眞是一個奇怪的謎。但他怕惹起了李先生的動怒，忙忍耐着不敢問。</p>
<p>看見他們每討論一次，便要吵一回架，海泉便想，這眞是唐耀星所常掛在唇皮上的小布爾喬亞的劣根性的表現了。</p>
<p>他們對於海泉都是冷冷的，並且看見他們開始討論與海泉無關的社務了，海泉便告辭出來，他感着一陣空虚。</p>
<p>站在電車站傍，仰起頭來望了望天空，月亮又高又小，呈慘碧色，周圍是冷風襲襲的。　　三十五</p>
<p>回到歐家巷三元里曹世光的住宅裏來時，已經是十一點欠一刻了。</p>
<p>海泉看見秋英先回來了，但尚未卸去她的外出的新裝。她立在床前，屈着腰身，像是在安置小孩兒睡覺。小孩子在哭着。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c200">羣英會 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 寳符</p>
<p>最近前線的戰事已經引不起國人的注意。國人的目光已都放射到遠隔重洋的華盛頓去，注視着就要在華盛頓上臺的一幕新把戲，這幾天國内不是喧嚷着出席華府談話會的人選？「宋部長」「孫院長」在我們這裏也已嚷得夠閙了，現在經政府「愼重」的考慮結果，經「本人」謙遜的推讓之下，已决定由宋部長出馬。在不久的將來，宋部長就要乘風破浪前去。，在華府談話會中擔任串演的一個角。色。。</p>
<p>華府談話會由美國新任總綂羅斯福君召集，被邀的國家，是有個數的幾個强國，蕞爾小國自然被擯棄，（中國居然也被寵邀，得齒强國之林，好不榮幸，）而參加各國的代表，又大都是强有力的一等角色，足以充分代表各國的意志，如英國的首揆麥唐納，法國的前總理赫里歐，意國的財務大臣容格，日本的外交元老石井菊次郎，都是一時的俊彥豪傑，這次的談話。，實不啻是列强的。「羣英會。」。</p>
<p>然則「羣英會」將討論些什麽呢？討論的範圍可就不小，整個的戰債問題，世界經濟會議，關稅政策，國際匯兌，世界貿易，軍縮問題以及世界一般情勢等等。至於和我國切身相關的遠東問題。據說亦「擬」討論及之。正因爲聽到了。「中日問題也。「擬」討論及之。」，我國的人民都伸長了　子。，期望着這次的談。話會給中日問題一個公平的判斷和有力的制裁。，而我國政府也正爲此。，特别注。意出席的人選。。</p>
<p>談話的結果怎樣，當然非我們所能臆料，不過中日問題的萬不能在這次談。話中增進解决的途徑。，即使增進了也未必有利於我們。，我們不要惑於羅斯福號召的口號，說這次談話的目的是在於促進國際的合作，這所謂「國際。」，只是。帝國主義國家之間的國際。，所謂合作。，只是帝國主義的的聯合而已。。這我們觀於。社會主義的蘇俄和其他小國的未被邀請。，就可顯然地明白了。。</p>
<p>蘇俄，是牠們共同的敵人，這次談話，主旨就在於進攻牠們共同敵人的聯合準備，在於奠定資本主義反蘇的總陣線。要奠定穩固的陣線，就得先解决牠們共同感受着的深刻的恐慌，所以經濟問題就成爲討論的主題；要實行一致的聯合，就得暫時消除帝國主義自身的衝突，所以國際合作就成爲號召的口號了。羅斯福不是暗示着將放棄美國八年來所採外交孤立政策麽？這就十足證明美。國已下了加入反蘇陣綫的决心了。。英美的合作。，就將在這次談話中促成。；日美的衝突。，也要在這次談話中緩和。。英美合作成功，英國的戰債，或將暫時不成爲重大的國際問題，日美的衝突暫時消失，勢必至美國承認日本在遠東的地位。英美日美是世界上最基本最尖銳的對立。，如果這兩種對立能得暫時緩和。，反蘇的戰綫就得組成。，這就是這次談話會根本的目標。。所以。，在這樣情勢之下。，遠東問題實成爲謀達到他們目標的一種關鍵。，這樣。，中國眼巴巴的還希望有公。理的判斷。，不是夢想嗎。！</p>

<p>— 賢</p>
<p>老爺與太太</p>
<p>老爺與太太是上海夜話中的主角。在上海晨話中，除了跳舞塲中倦跳歸來，從汽車中搬進小洋房刹那間的客串之外，早已睡在野鴨絨墊褥中尋甜蜜之夢，這裏提起的老爺太太，自然另有其人，謂余不信，請觀下文，</p>
<p>我的家是在一條很熱閙的沿馬路弄内。一天到晚，各種嘈雜的聲音，無論弄内的，馬路上的，都能明浙的送達我們的聽覺；不特白天没有清靜，就是深夜也不得安睡。每天比較最安靜的時候，就是我的工作完畢歸來之際；照例對於我似乎不生問題，但見晨曦初上，上海人經騐聽慣的高吭聲從老爺太太的沙嗓子中狂喊，於是娘姨共馬嘶長鳴，我這疲乏的身體，不免以小資産階級的立塲暗駡他們擾人清夢，不知趣的東西！　　紅日西沉，自已再從床上起來，不免想起每天這樣奔波，爲的什麽？老爺太太與我是同樣的人，他們的沙嗓子，等於我的手；他們的高吭聲，等於我寫出來的字。我要吃飯，難道他們不要吃飯了，我要安睡，難道他們不會安睡？不怕早霜寒露的威迫？無論寒暑，每天如是，每年如是，没有安息，辛辛苦苦，爲的是每天幾毛錢的進欵，回去撫老養小，支持一家的生命，一天不做，就一天没有吃，所以往往從倒公子倒千金直到老爺太太的時候，還做着「倒」字輩的苦工。一生没有好的吃，好的穿，好的住，生命的記號變成了沙嗓子，還是「倒」，「倒」，達生命的終點。</p>
<p>他們雖然做着這樣污穢的工作，但是我們能夠缺少他們嗎？在上海住着大洋房有抽水馬桶拉尿倒底能有幾何？爲的是他們做着污穢的工作，就被君子大人所卑視，但是上海没有了他們，咱們坐汽車跳舞的老爺太太知道上海將成怎樣的世界？</p>
<p>靠自已的力，吃自已的飯，這正是目前需要的人材！</p>
<p>我揉着羞澀的眼皮，並不因没有睡醒而再駡他們不知趣的東西。匆匆呼過一枝香烟後，拖着沉重的脚步，利用我的手去抓吃的穿的住的。</p>
<p>但是這時候已將近晚上，老爺太太正穿着得整整齊齊的去追求他們的享樂似雪亮的一九三三奥司汀，什麽綢，什麽緞的新裝，在霓虹燈中追逐。</p>
<p>我埋首在槁件堆中，望望壁上的時鐘，今天能否早一點歸去，在老爺太太没有工作之前。</p>

<p>不出錢的使女</p>
<p>編者先生·</p>
<p>我是一個弱女子，自從七歲那一年，就到這裏來，到現在已經十一年了。我的身分，名義上是一個養女，但事實上是一個」没有工錢的使女」罷了。在過去的十一年裏，所受的苦楚，眞所爲一言難盡。近來的生活，更不對了，一切的一切，都要我一個人去做。但是這樣牛馬般的一年做到頭，所得的代價，除了幾件僅可蔽體的舊衣服，和一天三頓的殘羹冷飯之外，就祇有「忍氣」與「挨駡」了。我久想逃出這個環境，但是一直没有機會。兩年前，我僥倖認識了一個比我大三歲的男子；他也非常愛我。在這兩年裏，我們彼此已經有了認識：所以很自然的想結爲夫婦。我也知道，最好的辦法，當然要央出入來，向我的主人要求，成全我們這一樁心願。但是他當然也是被一般人所認爲低三下四的人物，呌他那裏有這種門路呢？並且我的主人，正拿我看做一塊已經墾熱的田地，那裏肯就此答應呢？不得已而思其次，我就要求他與我私奔；但是他，究竟是一個好人：怕因此而觸犯法網，所以竟一時不敢嘗試。先生，要是我當眞與他私奔了，會不會累及他呢？除此之外，我再有没有别的方法；可以達到我所要過的生活呢？請先生在這二三天内，詳詳細細的答復我。我在這裏很誠懇地盼望着呢丨祝你</p>
<p>康健　沈素貞謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者安：上面的來信，雖則經過我們相當的改造，但原信也尚不失爲詞能達意。以一個從小就做人家養女的女子、能夠有這樣造詣，她的主人，似乎還不十分兇惡。所以這件事，我們還主張向沈女士的主人說明爲是。你可以自已將這層意思，告訴他們，用不着一定要找第三者傳話。你不妨說「我的主意已定，即使你們不答應，這件事，也一定要幹的」。他們倘能迎合潮流，允許你的要求，當然最好。要是萬一他們不出你的預料，不肯放你走；那末你可以請求一個律師，先將你與他們的關係脫離，這是很容易辦到的丨然後再與你的對方結婚。「私奔」實在不是一個辦法，累及他身羅法網，當然難免；而且一旦跑了出去，你俩的生活，一定會受威迫的呀丨望三思而後行丨</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>他竭力的思索着，苦苦的祈禱着，希望他能鈎把這個已犯了衆怒的王國棟，很安全地救出來；因爲他思索太苦，神經已暫時起了變化，使他模模糊糊地老是站着，半嚮不歸原座，幸而他是全校的領袖，雖有人注目，却没有人干涉，更虧大部份的與會者，都在屏聲息氣的靜聽台上主席的報告，無暇顧及這位校長先生的異動了，可是台上主席的報告，他竟不曾聽到一句，待他漸漸鎭定過來的時候，祇聽得台下的人拉直了嗓子，没命的在高喊：</p>
<p>「嚴辦貪財賣國的王國棟！</p>
<p>「開除破壞全校名譽的王國棟！</p>
<p>其中，還夾着一班激烈份子怒吼。</p>
<p>「快綁他去遊街！</p>
<p>「罰他站半個月木籠！</p>
<p>最後，有許多情感衝動得最劇烈的青年，竟舉起了粗大的手臂，瞪出了可怕的眸子，擠擠挨挨的要衝上臺去實行動武了。</p>
<p>王國棟處於四面楚歌之中，想逃走又不能，想討饒又没用，眼見要吃一塲大虧了；他把兩條手臂緊緊地護住了他的腦袋，蹲下了半個身子，牙齒格格地在響着，差一些快嚇死了。</p>
<p>「現在大家的主張差不多已一致了！像這樣不知羞恥的東西，决不能輕輕以開除了事，必須重重的懲罰他，那末，我們快討論懲罰的方式丨」主席團裏，有一個說話很洪亮，態度很壯毅的人，走將出來，制住了大家的紛擾，提綱撮要的說了幾句話。</p>
<p>伍逸定神一瞧，說話的原來就是他兒子伍源。</p>
<p>「非罰他站一個月木籠不可！</p>
<p>「强迫他家屬捐助義勇軍軍費一萬元贖罪！</p>
<p>「敎他打明天起，登報十天，供述罪狀！</p>
<p>動武的緊急處置雖給伍源勸住了，但是各方所提出的懲戒的方式却愈閙愈兇，竟有主張把王國棟押送戒嚴司令部去按章法槍斃的：就在他們紛呶不决的當兒，伍逸已移動了他的脚步，走到了講臺上來。</p>
<p>「聽伍校長發表意見」！站在中央的那一位學生反日會的常務委員劉驥，以爲伍逸也有什麽懲戒王國棟的意見要提出，便高喊了一聲，使臺下的人一律停止發言，讓他好說話。</p>
<p>「主席，請問王國棟犯了什麽過失？」伍逸存心要給王國棟辯護，不得不先問明原委。</p>
<p>「校長丨你雙方才没有聽見我們的報告嗎？」劉驥顯着十分詫異的神氣，勉强忍耐着，重複的說道：「王國棟是反日會檢貨組的主任，所負的責任很大。不料，最近學生總聯合會方面派人來警告，說我們不但檢貨不力，而且還有人受了奸商的賄賂，將那些有鈐印的「已經騐訖」的封皮偷發出去，使日貨依舊可以暢銷，我們得到了這個警告之後，便嚴密調查，結果才知是王國棟一個人幹的好事丨」</p>
<p>「有證據没有？」伍逸詰問着。</p>
<p>「怎麽没有丨」劉驥對於伍逸的詰問很表示不滿。「我們已拘到了兩家洋什貨店主，他們全招認了，就是王國棟他自已，也並不不抵賴丨所以，我們現在祗須商議怎樣懲罰他了丨</p>
<p>劉驥的話才說完，已另有幾個學生簇擁着兩個商人模樣的中年人，擠到了伍逸的面前，意思是說：「人證俱在，不信你自已問吧丨」這樣左證確鑿，就是請王國棟的老子丨開業了二十多年的大律師王玉麟親自來辯護，也無從挽回了，何况素不善於雄辯的伍逸丨</p>
<p>「唔：：，這樣就把他開除了罷丨」伍逸打算把允許開除王國棟來緩和塲上的空氣。</p>

<h3 id="c206">華雷斯皮萊成功的分析 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 文瑛</p>
<p>自已認貌醜爲其主因</p>
<p>「大飯店」中的大明星華雷斯皮萊的臉，狗看見了都要逃走的，其貌之不揚，可想而知。但全世界的影迷們，看見了他的臉，都覺得可愛；無論他扮的是强盜，賊，奸商，僞君子，都要稱贊地表演得好，你說奇怪不奇性。這裏有他自已分淅自已的成功的一段談話，他歸功於他自已面貌之醜。我曾看見過清宮内，所藏歷代帝王之像，其中有奇醜，望之不似人君者。如明太祖形貌如猪，醜極；但相者謂此雖猪形，實猪龍所生，貴極，所以能作天子。故貌奇醜者，非奇賤即奇貴。現在這位華雷斯皮萊，大鼻，闊嘴略向前出，亦有些像猪，所以幼時爲牧奴（曾爲人牧象），現爲大明星，由極賤躍而爲大富。我現在將他的談話譯出，刊諸申報影刊，以爲天下人之貌醜者一吐氣焉。（以下係皮萊自已的談話）</p>
<p>「你問我怎樣成名的麽？這連我自已都不知道。我倘使知道了，我一定肯奉告的。（他從化裝室的牆上一面鏡子裏斜睨著自已繼續地說）或者係因爲我這副尊容太不像話的緣故吧！我想除此之外，没有什麽别的理由。但眞是想不到，我這副尊容會賺大錢。不過（他有些靦覥）我小的時候，相貌並不難看。你看見過我小時候的照相没有？你别看不起我。我還進過歌舞團呢丨我和我的哥哥諾亞在歌舞團中表演過，這就是我扮戲的第一步。你想想我們二位張開了河馬似的大口，喝著歌，跳著舞，那係一種什麽景像呀！</p>
<p>「我和人家配着戲，到幕終的時候，女子的愛情總是屬於人家的。我亦不生氣，因事實如此，一個人有了這副嘴臉，大可不必妄想博女子之愛了丨</p>
<p>「但是論到臉醜，我亦有許多便宜之處，爲小白臉所不能及的。第，一我不用化妝，儘我這天生的一幅地圖，可以無往而不利。第二，我不用多撑行頭，因爲不去上等紳士們的角色。第三，我頭髮秃頂，亦不用愁。第四，我在公衆地方剔牙，亦没有人非笑我。第五，我三天不修面，亦没有人管我。第六，我不怕老。人家在鏡子裏發見了自已額上一道縐紋，就生了美人遲暮之感；我不怕，縐紋，越多越好。至於我的頭髮，剪平頂亦可以，蓬蓬鬆鬆亦可以，眞是無往而不利。</p>
<p>「我曾和瑪利特蘭漱爭吵過一次。當時她雖勝了，但我至今尚不服氣。我們在拍攝Min　and　Bill的時候，瑪利和我爭誰頂醜。我以爲我頂醜，誰知她堅持她頂醜。在爭持决裂的當兒，我因她是一位老太太，我不得不讓步了。其實她不過年老了一些，她怎能及到我的貌醜呢！」</p>
<p>（他站了起來又看看旁邊的那面鏡子說道）「我一年醜似一年，但是越醜越好丨」</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c207">對於「球影珠光」的幾句閒話 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 薇</p>
<p>昨天在「新光」觀了「球影珠光」一片，今晨讀了申報電影專刊的評，覺得有幾句閒話要說；就是「凌鶴」先生對於該片的故事及攝該片的動機與背境有些誤會了。</p>
<p>關於故事：其主要之點，在本片主角以其本身經歷，以一失足之誤，幾陷於墮落不堪之境；及見其胞弟將重蹈覆轍，乃設法於球賽中使其弟之自傲心屈服，而不致遭萬惡社會之引誘。此實一倫理友愛，仁俠精神的敎訓。</p>
<p>至於動機：則本片之故事僅爲穿揷，而其兩班足球比賽實爲攝該片之動機。蓋美國人士，對於大學足球賽之狂熱，已有半世紀之歷史。每年秋冬各城鎭之大學每次足球賽時，作壁上觀者恒多至一二十萬人者，其盛况與狂熱可知。而各大學亦莫不以羅致訓練精悍球隊，以爲振揚校譽之唯一工具。每年於球賽時季終了時，例有「全美球隊」與「全美第二球隊」之名譽隊員選擇，由全國最負盛譽之足球敎練組成之評判機關選定之，但此種名譽球隊之比賽，迄未舉行過，美國電影界猜透民衆心理，遂將一烏發公司新片「投機夫人」之一幕。該片於今日起。在新光大戲院開映。女主角爲凱娣鼐姬。前在上海開映之「霓裳仙子」及「寃家喜相逢」等片。均伊所主演。凡曾觀過以上兩片者。對於女士之色藝。或尚未曾忘却也。</p>
<p>九三○年與一九三一年之獲選於「全美球隊」之隊員，聘請之以攝該片，故其英文名仍爲「全美足球隊」（All　Americns）至於本片主角兄弟二人雖純爲電影演員，而據實在，彼等前在學校時亦皆爲足球名將也。再講到背境：則以全國人士對於足球之狂熱，一般大學生在校之時雖能以足球或運動負名一時，而畢業後彼等恒以除運動外無他藝之長，終倫於失業墮落。故該片帶有諷世之意，使一輩青年學子勿爲虚榮所迷，而棄學業於不顧也。至於片中女性與社會的穿揷，亦無非勸勵學生示以社會之惡境，亦以增進故事之興趣而已。末了鄙人說這幾句閒話的宗旨，因爲看見昨天都半的觀客，是同影片中主人一樣的青年學子，</p>
<h3 id="c208">「剝削窮人」 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 謝行光</p>
<p>足足有二個月没有踏進戲院門一步的我，今天再也不能阻止胸中澎漲的看戲慾，於日摸出袋中僅有的二毛大洋，一直向着「普羅化的ＸＸ大戲院進發。不到片刻ＸＸ大戲院的外表，已由糊塗而分明，盡現在眼前，我摸出了袋中的二毛大洋，預備去換一張入塲劵。</p>
<p>踱進了戲院的大門，把二毛大洋向售票處一捺，搭足了主顧的臭架子，開口說：「找！」</p>
<p>「齊巧正好！」那賣票的向我上下打量了一會說。</p>
<p>「是大洋啦！」我很驚異的又說。</p>
<p>「戲院裏的規矩，大洋和小洋是同樣通用的。」</p>
<p>「唔！大洋就是小洋：」我打了寒噤，接過了票，黯然向黑暗的塲中走去。「剝削窮人」四個字湧上了我的腦海。</p>
<p>編者識：我將你的稿子，登牠出來；下月還可以多看兩回電影；但是你最好換了小洋去，以免再被剝削。</p>
<h3 id="c209">「壓迫」攝製完竣 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 靜觀</p>
<p>明星公司最近的製作</p>
<p>新近明星影片公司又完成了一部無聲片，於前晚春雨瀟瀟的夜半，在中央大戲院非正式的試映過了。</p>
<p>這片子的名字呌做「壓迫」，導演者是高梨痕，片中的主人翁是一個性格懦弱的工人，他的工廠因爲受了大資本家操縱經濟的壓迫而倒閉，他使連帶的失了業。失業以後，没法想，祗好讓妻子出去帮傭；結果，妻子被人家奪去了，老母和女兒死在雪地裏了；最後他找到了職業，又受了人家的陷害，終於帶着悠悠的悲恨郎當入獄。在這片子裏，所謂下層社會的勞苦生活，是一絲不漏地給描寫了出來。片中主演的角色，是龔稼農飾工人，夏佩珍飾工人的妻子。這兩位，飾起蓬頭亂服的窮人來做戲要比西裝旗袍更可觀，還有一位重要的女角色，就是嚴月閒丨照着她的個性，在片中飾的自然自摩登漂亮的一朶交際花了</p>
<h3 id="c210">七公司合攝片救國　據云政府已答應協助 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 宗</p>
<p>在滬上作盛大宣傳的「航空救國」，成績也不能算壞，但是未入會的民衆，在上海一方面說：也不能算是少數，所以電影界的熱心份子們，他們就想了以電影爲宣傳的工具，製作一部大規模的「航空救國」影片，以事擴大宣傳，使我國民，必具救國之心，集資多購飛機，以禦暴日飛機的横行，救我國家，護我人民的生命財産，使敵人不得逞其禍害我人民的淫威丨</p>
<p>現在那些電影界的熱心家，已經有了兩度的會議啦，决定合作的公司是七家計有聲影片公司三家：</p>
<p>一·和合公司。二·明星公司。三·天一公司。無聲影片公司有四家。一·聯華公司。二曁南公司。三·大東公司。四·月明公司。這七家公司是分工合作性質，每家担任拍片三千尺或一千尺影片，片子機器，佈景，冲洗，演員，導演，及其他都由各公司盡救國的義務，片子是規定無聲的，大概是便於村鎭宣傳時放映。</p>
<p>本月廿四日，這七家熱心救國的公司，要開一個，劇本委員會，每家都派代表出席，而每家都擬定一小段劇本材料，這段材料的長短，也正和片子相洽，那麽再由委員會討論怎樣把片子連接成氣，成功一部極有力的抗日宣傳的偉大影片。</p>
<p>據說：這部戲的攝製，政府也肯協助，無論用兵艦，飛機，軍隊，軍器，都可借用，諒想這部影片的成功，一定是開偉大影片新紀錄的抗日救國片呢。</p>
<h3 id="c211">電影小說忠魂錄Cavalcade（一） <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 訥</p>
<p>「忠魂錄」係美國福斯公司出品，但演員導演，一切一切都是英國的。本刊於「忠魂錄」攝製的經過，已於上月二十九及三十日由凛君接連介紹過。現再倩訥君節譯其本事排日披露，以響閱者。</p>
<p>那天又是除夕。在梅理歐的家庭中琪茵及羅伯，在結褵後，十載歡娱，猶如一日。照例到了除夕的十二時，他們夫妻已定舉杯相慶，以歡送一年的平安過去，而歡迎一年的平安降生。但今年已不比往年，今日所送的不是尋常的一年，而是莽莽百年的一世紀，因爲那天正是一八九九年的十二月三十一日。</p>
<p>新世紀猶之是新生命。而在這新世紀的初葉，英國在南斐洲，已與荷蘭駐紮農民發生戰事。羅伯新年之内，即須束裝前往，執戈衛國。琪茵一思至此，棲慘欲絶。十年和樂的家庭，已爲凄風冷雨所籠罩。夫君旣須遠征，二子俱屬幼穉。此後之日月，蓋亦益增切怛矣。</p>
<p>琪茵眼中包了一眶眼淚，一天没有乾過。她看了那盆僕人僕婦送給她的花，指向她丈夫道：「越是小東西，越動人心。我想哭一塲。」她嗚咽着：「幾滴眼淚，用來歡迎新世紀。」</p>
<p>羅伯抱持着她，她得到了無限的勇敢。這時遠處鏡聲尚未敲，這辰光尚屬舊世紀，是羅伯和她公同享樂的承平時代。她看住了他的臉問道：「我們結婚到如今，何等快樂！」</p>
<p>「到如今？」羅伯心中的恐懼，琪茵亦未始不曉得，「何不爲將來留一餘地呢？」</p>
<p>琪茵哭了。「誰知有没有將來？唉，寳貝，親愛的，爲什麽一定要離開我，呌我怎能忍受呢？」</p>
<p>「號吹了！」羅伯笑着。他不能不笑；倘使不笑，他祇可兩陪着哭了，因爲他自已，亦有藴結不解的苦處。「號吹了，國旗飄揚着。」然後他哼着一支軍歌的調兒「英國人永生永世不作他人之奴隸。」</p>

<h3 id="c212">適應新時代的韋廉斯新汽車 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>價格較前低减製造較前完美爲理想的最優美便宜之汽車　　時代遷流。事物隨變。今日之世界。眞可謂新世界。韋廉斯奥佛倫看透了這現實的新世界的潮流。遂開始製造一九三三年式的汽車。盪除其歷來陳舊之氣象。以適應時下的經濟之特别情狀。</p>
<p>當韋廉斯奥佛倫公司設計製造一九三三年式的汽車之時。即抱定主張。爲社會上自一九二九年以來。進益減少百分之五十以上者着想。故新汽車的價格。必以適合减低的購買力爲極準。而其式樣之美。功用之大。却不可减除分毫。務使爲最苛細之買客所樂用。該公司又察知社會一般之購買習慣。與從前完全相反。往往斤斤於所費之幾何。費去一個袁頭。定要獲得一百分的價值。蓋賺錢之難。遠非昔比也。故該公司决定新汽車不但買價須便宜。即其平日一切維持費用。亦須減省。方爲適應社會羣衆之購買力。</p>
<p>車式精新允推獨一</p>
<p>該公司一九三三年汽車式樣。頓易舊觀。煥然獨新。根據科學原理。仿效飛機構造。增加最高速度。而燃料費用並不加添。且其車身姿態美妙。又遠在舊有式樣之上。總之。韋廉斯奥佛倫之新汽車實可稱爲普大之下採用優流線式最完備之汽車。</p>
<p>即其車燈。亦根據流線式。裝置於防護板上。向後傾斜。以符車線之配稱。而光線逕向前面放射。且因車燈　在之角度之放。光線分布更爲美滿。</p>
<p>最大目標在於經濟</p>
<p>該公司最大目標在使汽車更爲經濟。故日常維持費之節省。其重要正與減低買價相等。韋廉斯七七式之造成。用美制一介侖汽油。能行二十五英里至三十英里。用一介侖機器油。能行一千英里。即該公司達到目標之明證也。就事實言之。。該公司已將運輸費用減除一半。正與社會羣衆進益減低之數相合。</p>
<p>論新車成績。該公司亦深知處此時代。運輸首重穩妥迅速故新車之構造。適應最苛求之駕駛人的需要。每小時行七十英里。而恃其專利的「浮力」之故。又能平滑勝常。實爲其特點之一。又其第二擋排速度之高。可保運行美妙。動定迅速。</p>
<p>特點甚多粗舉如左</p>
<p>韋廉斯七七式裝用四汽缸引擎。能生四十八匹馬力。每分鐘三千二百轉。放汽凡而位置適宜。駕駛人便之。活塞製以生鐵。有壓縮圈三。回油圈一。克拉子及傳動機均係老式。克拉子以整個金屬片製造。直徑八英寸。塞車直徑九英寸。闊一寸六分。只須在踏板上輕施壓力。動作隨之矣。</p>
<p>車身全體用純鋼製造。車框用雙垂X式。爲車框之最新式樣。前後均極堅固　　前座後座皆頗寛闊。彈簧坐墊非常深穩。依照正當角度向後倒斜。故十分舒適。七七式轎車之前部有單人坐位。皆能活絡。旁邊設有一小抽斗。爲置放零星包件之處。</p>
<p>車輪直徑十七英寸。輪緣三英寸。車胎五英寸。車輪亦仿流線式製造。前軸依仿舊時工式。曲度極微。因此扭力非常堅固云。</p>
<p>火星管理器完全自動。防熱器可隨時調節。其他設備如水壓前後制震器。不眩目前窗濾油器。照後鏡。橡皮踏板。脚踏加速機等等。無不一應俱全。</p>
<p>廿六年來此爲結晶</p>
<p>此韋廉斯奥佛倫一九三三年新汽車實爲其有史以來二十六年中最大之成績。蓋竭其精神財力與所有設備完全赴之。始克告此成功。處此經濟力衰減的世界欲享用適合時代需求的汽車。將舍此何求。爰述其新車優點之梗概如上。俾購買汽車者知所問津焉。</p>

<p>(Luanzhou) The people of Eastern Luan are all groaning under the violent oppression of the Japanese army. Everything is in a state of disorder. Puppet elements outside the pass and local traitors are actively colluding, first forming a maintenance association, and then preparing to establish a puppet county government. The people of Luan are disturbed by enemy planes from time to time and dare not live in peace, fleeing together. The wealthy class flees to Beiping and Tianjin, and laborers flee to Guye, Kaiping, and the surrounding villages. Businesses are closed and schools are suspended. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Those coming to Beiping from Kaiping talk about the passage of the recent loss of Lengkou, saying that the enemy army's previous attacks on Xifengkou were unfavorable, and Lengkou was also repeatedly unable to be captured, which damaged the reputation of their so-called imperial army. A month ago, they urgently transferred the entire 12th Division and the Hattori Brigade, plus the Kawahara Detachment, totaling over 10,000 enemies. First, they used a large force to exert fierce pressure on He Zhuguo's forces in eastern Luan to demoralize them. At the same time, because only a company of Song's cavalry was stationed at Dongjiakou, they divided their forces to advance fiercely on that place in order to contain our left flank at Lengkou. In order to consolidate the left flank defense line, Shang Zhen's forces transferred Gao Hongwen's division to meet the enemy at Dongjiakou. At this time, only Dong Guanghua's division remained at Lengkou. Because our forces were dispersed, the enemy launched a roundabout flanking attack from both the left and right wings. Because Shang Zhen's forces were attacked from both the front and rear, they abandoned the Lengkou area on the 11th. After this battle, Shang Zhen's Huang Division suffered a great loss, and the Gao Division also suffered about one-third casualties. They are now actively trying to replenish their forces. Our army has laid out a strict defense line west of Qian'an Luan River. If the enemy attacks again, it may not be easy. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen arrived in Beiping today to visit He Yingqin for consultations. According to talks, various units have concentrated on the west bank of the Luan River. His troops fought in Lengkou, determined to sacrifice themselves and not retreat to the death, so the casualties were very high. However, sacrificing for the country is also glorious. However, in the future, it is hoped that there will be an overall plan, with unity from top to bottom, to kill the enemy desperately. The Luan River line is no less dangerous than the Great Wall and can still be firmly defended. The enemy has repeatedly crossed the river from Qian'an, but has been repelled. Resisting Japan and killing the enemy should be a unified action, otherwise, if the enemy attacks one place with their main force, there is no place that cannot be captured. Since we are resisting Japan and killing the enemy, we should go out and attack the enemy, and not defend for a long time, which will demoralize our army. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen said that the Japanese army invading Lengkou has been advancing towards the east bank of the Luan River for days. Our army previously retreated to the west bank of the Luan River due to the threat of Taipingzhai on the left flank, and has been deploying defenses step by step. The defense line is extremely solid, and the various units have completed reorganization. A small part of the enemy crossed the river from Guanzhuang to invade a few days ago, but was repelled by us. Our Luanxi and left-wing units are completely linked together. If the enemy invades, there will only be bloody sacrifices. The situation at the front has been reported in detail to the Military Affairs Committee. The Japanese army advancing from Lengkou is the Japanese 6th Division and the Hattori Brigade's Kawahara Detachment, totaling more than 10,000 men. Enemy planes have been bombing the Luan River fiercely for days. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

However, the enemy troops were extremely tenacious and still advanced towards our positions in dense formations, engaging in hand-to-hand combat four or five times.

Our army urgently transferred reinforcements from the rear to fight fiercely with the enemy. Both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat multiple times at North and South Tuan Ting. As of noon today, there was still fierce fighting. About twenty enemy planes bombed the Saheqiao and Santunying areas this morning. Both the enemy and our side suffered many casualties.

Xu's left arm was also wounded and broken. He was furious and forgot the pain. Seeing the enemy attacking head-on under the cover of the plane, he hurriedly took out a hand grenade from his waist and threw it. However, it was difficult to throw with only one hand, so he held the grenade in his mouth, pulled out the pin with one hand, and threw it out. The enemy in front was killed or wounded by his continuous throwing of four grenades, and the enemy could not succeed and retreated. At this time, Xu was shot again in the ribs. Fortunately, two farmers came to rescue him from the trench and took him to the rear hospital for treatment. He has now been transported to Beiping for treatment. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Current Symptoms of China's Economy <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Wei</p>
<p>For a hundred years, China's economy has been in a continuous decline. Today, it has reached its final desperate situation. This problem is the root of all the complex and intertwined problems we face today, and the source of all turmoil. If China wants to achieve internal stability, and does not first seek to remedy this fundamental problem that creates turmoil and national crisis, then it is unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>If we examine the current symptoms of China's economy, we cannot help but be shocked by the depth of our country's chronic diseases and the emergence of dangerous symptoms, which are almost beyond remedy. Indeed, economic panic has now become a common phenomenon in the capitalist world, not unique to China. However, China's panic is qualitatively different from that of the capitalist powers and cannot be compared. In short, the panic of the capitalist powers is due to surplus, while the panic of our country is due to the aggression of imperialism, due to insufficiency.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the current symptoms of China's economy are the accelerated collapse of the rural economy, the accelerated decline of people's purchasing power, the unnatural concentration of finance in cities, and the decline and desolation of industry and commerce. Although the statistics are incomplete, we cannot see the whole picture. However, due to multifaceted counter-evidence, we can also glimpse one aspect of it.</p>
<p>What is this multifaceted counter-evidence? First, from the perspective of foreign trade, last year's total import value was 1,049,246,661 Customs Taels, a decrease of 384,242,533 Customs Taels compared to the previous year. Last year's total export value was 492,641,421 Customs Taels, a sharp decrease of 416,834,104 Customs Taels compared to the previous year. Among the imported goods, agricultural products still accounted for the largest number. In terms of value, last year it was 348,591,941 Customs Taels, especially major agricultural products such as rice, wheat, flour, and cotton. As for exported goods, raw silk, tea, tung oil, eggs, etc., all showed a sharp decline. From this fact, we can glimpse the decline of China's agricultural production and the general outline of the fierce aggression of capitalist economics against us.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the accelerating decline of people's purchasing power, according to the recently published 21st business report of the Bank of China, the savings of middle-class farmers are only one or twenty yuan, and those below cannot even obtain one yuan in cash. Some families that grow mulberry trees cannot raise silkworms. When asked why, they said they could not get one yuan to buy silkworm eggs. Some farmers cannot even get a 10 yuan loan for one cow. The decline in farmers' purchasing power can be seen here in general. As for cities, taking Shanghai as an example, the number of operating businesses decreased by one-third last year compared to the previous year. It is even worse this year. The closure of businesses reflects the decline in the purchasing power of urban residents. The general purchasing power of the people is so low, can the national economy still be asked about?</p>
<p>In short, China's economy today is riddled with holes and on the verge of collapse. The above-mentioned are just a few of the most prominent aspects. In the midst of the global economic panic, the coming great disaster is just beginning. If we talk about internal stability today, this most serious fundamental problem cannot be ignored. Otherwise, seeking fish from trees will only add to the image of adding fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee members Feng Yuxiang and others proposed that the land tax surcharges in various provinces should be completely abolished in the shortest possible time, and that no new names should be invented for collecting surcharges in the future, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties and prevent the rural areas from becoming more bankrupt. The Executive Yuan has now instructed the financial departments of various provinces to comply. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Wang Jingwei's Remarks After Arriving in Nanjing <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei returned to Nanjing and spoke. Some days ago, he went to Shanghai to ask Dr. Noel to excise a boil on his back. However, due to seeing too many guests, he developed chills and fever in the evening, which only subsided slightly yesterday. In this upcoming Washington conference, the representatives sent by various countries are either prime ministers or ministers. I have therefore gone to Shanghai to request Vice President Song to undertake the trip to America. Our country's proposed opinions for the conference have been discussed several times, and three main points have been roughly decided. The content is not convenient to disclose at this time. Currently, at this time of utmost urgency in defending against foreign aggression and suppressing bandits, the financial issues will definitely not be affected by Song's trip to America. There will be no problem with monthly military and administrative expenses. Furthermore, for other temporary expenses, Vice Ministers Li and Zou are also capable of managing. The success or failure of the northern battles is a common occurrence. Recalling the September 18th Incident, three provinces were lost in a few days. Within less than ten days, Rehe fell. However, today, the battles at various passes of the Great Wall and the Luan River area have persisted for over a month under the intense bombardment of the enemy forces. The soldiers at the front lines are bravely resisting and are definitely not cowards who fear death. Recently, due to strategic considerations, there have been some setbacks. It is believable that there will soon be a fierce general counter-offensive. Regarding the issue of troops from the Southwest, I have expressed my opinion in Shanghai. In my opinion, at this time of combined attacks from foreign aggression and bandit communists, all parties should assist in clearing the communists and defending against foreign aggression, regardless of the circumstances, and should not delay with excuses. Therefore, the Central Government has telegraphed the various provinces in the Southwest to expedite the dispatch of troops to assist in suppressing the bandit communists, but to this day, there is still no date for their departure. I still remember when the January 28th Incident occurred last year, I telegraphed Guangdong Province to send troops to take over defense and suppress bandits, so that the central armies could focus on resisting Japan. However, the result was still disappointing. Now that North China is in such a critical situation, if they continue to delay, Chairman Chiang will not be able to personally go north to supervise the troops, and the various units will not be able to be transferred to the front lines to provide reinforcements. It is hoped that the generals in the Southwest will resolutely dispatch troops to enter Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, so as not to delay national affairs. The Central Committee members in the Southwest have telegraphed their opposition to the Central Government convening a temporary national representative assembly in November of this year. Now that the country is in a critical state, convening it earlier only differs by a few months. At the same time, the Third Plenary Session decided to convene a National Assembly in April of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). Now, if we discuss convening it earlier, it would only be a matter of one and a half years. The Central Standing Committee believes that there are sufficient reasons for advocating for an earlier convening, given the critical state of the country's survival. The opposition from the Southwest is difficult to understand, or perhaps it stems from a misunderstanding. (Eighteenth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a ceremony on the morning of the 18th to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the capital in Nanjing. Yu Youren, Wang Zhengting, Bai Wenwei, Zhu Peide, Chen Shaokuan, Lin Xiang, Shi Ying, and representatives of all National Government personnel, the five Yuan and ten ministries, totaling over six hundred people, attended. Led by Chairman Lin, they performed the ceremony as prescribed and delivered a speech, roughly stating that since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has always been in a complex and difficult situation. There are indeed many areas of past work that cannot be satisfied. However, we should consider how to strive in the present and future. Many comrades hope to end the period of political tutelage as soon as possible and return political power to the people. To realize this hope, we should first promote local autonomy. However, at the beginning of the promotion, there will inevitably be some difficulties. As long as we can base ourselves on the party's political program and do our best, while at the same time arousing the people and assisting the government to jointly plan and proceed, it will not be difficult to achieve our goals. This is a point that should be especially noted in today's commemorative ceremony. In addition, there is another key point, which is that we hope that the people of the whole country can unite, so that those at the front are striving to kill the enemy, and those at the rear are striving to improve governance. Although the foreign troubles are serious, they will not be difficult to eliminate. National revival through adversity is precisely our great path today. By following this path, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and consolidate the country's position. (Eighteenth Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e48">Soviet Russia Protests to Japan Over the China Eastern Railway Issue <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Puppets Deliberately Provoke Russia, Creating a Serious Situation</p>
<p>Demanding Effective Measures to Protect Soviet Russian Interests</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the tense situation on the China Eastern Railway, Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Karakhan lodged a protest with Japanese Ambassador Ota on April 16. This news has been officially released by TASS and published in today's newspapers. It is reported that Karakhan invited Ota to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on that day and made the following remarks on behalf of the Soviet government:</p>
<p>Deliberately Provoking Conflicts: "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict and the entry of Japanese troops into Manchuria, the Japanese government has repeatedly expressed through its ambassador in Moscow and directly to the Soviet ambassador in Japan, guarantees not to infringe upon Soviet interests, especially regarding the China Eastern Railway. The Soviet government accepted these guarantees with considerable trust, especially in the beginning, as the Manchurian local authorities seemed quite willing to avoid any actions that would discriminate against Soviet interests. Therefore, when the China Eastern Railway suffered serious damage, the Soviet government drew the attention of Japan without feeling particularly anxious, explaining everything as the impact of the military situation. However, in recent months, the actions of the 'puppet state' authorities and their Japanese advisors, as well as the Japanese officials in Manchuria, have directly created a serious situation on the China Eastern Railway, causing alarm to the Soviet government. This is not only due to the state into which the railway has fallen, but also because of the deliberate provocation of conflicts on various issues, making the entire situation increasingly serious. The Soviet government wishes to draw the Japanese government's attention to the following fundamental facts:</p>
<p>Illegally Occupying Wharves: On July 7, 1932, the 'puppet state' authorities seized the China Eastern Railway wharf in Harbin. The Soviet government notified the Japanese government the next day that this action was directly guided by Japanese employed by the 'puppet state.' This matter damaged the interests of the China Eastern Railway but has not yet been resolved. On April 11 of this year, Japanese troops occupied the wharf office, raised the Japanese flag, and posted Japanese guards. Even if the previous illegal actions were committed by the 'puppet state,' the Japanese authorities have now occupied the wharf that is still under negotiation. The Soviet Union cannot but protest this action.  Owing Huge Amounts of Freight Fees: The Soviet government agreed to the Japanese government's request to transport Japanese troops on the China Eastern Railway. It was agreed in advance to pay freight fees on time, so it was considered a purely commercial matter. However, negotiations between the China Eastern Railway and the Japanese authorities on the issue of payment were subjected to systematic delays. The accumulated debt has now reached a huge amount, increasing the railway's economic difficulties, as the railway's commercial transportation has been greatly affected by military operations in Manchuria.</p>
<p>Destroying Eurasian Transportation: What shocked the Soviet government most about the recent situation in Manchuria was the series of coercive actions taken by the police authorities under the direct orders and participation of Japanese officials on the Manchurian side to disrupt the normal operation of the China Eastern Railway and cause serious losses to Soviet interests. This included cutting off the tracks connecting the China Eastern Railway to the Outer Baikal Railway, damaging the Soviet Union's right to access the China Eastern Railway by train, obstructing Eurasian transportation, and seizing goods transported by the Soviet Union, etc. The eastern section of the China Eastern Railway is now in a completely disorganized state due to systematic attacks on vehicles and assassinations and kidnappings of Soviet people employed by the railway. The Japanese government guaranteed that it would transport troops on the railway to restore order, but in reality, the order and security of the railway are now worse than before.  Detention of Cars Without Error: Regarding the disputed issue of locomotives and cars, Karakhan declared that the Soviet government was in no error in this matter. The locomotives were the property of the Soviet Union and never belonged to the China Eastern Railway from the beginning. As for the cars, there are currently 2,000 of Soviet cars on the China Eastern Railway, exceeding the number of China Eastern Railway cars in the Soviet Union. The delay in their exchange and return is due to the military conflict between the Chinese troops and the Japanese-Manchurian troops.</p>
<p>Russians Subjected to Abuse: Karakhan then protested against the large-scale arrests of Soviet people, saying, "Most of them have been detained for more than a year without trial and have been subjected to extraordinary abuse by the Japanese gendarmerie and the Japanese employed by 'Manchukuo.' Of course, these facts are not the entirety of the facts infringing on Soviet interests, but the Soviet government has had to remind the Japanese government of the guarantees it made earlier and demand effective measures to earnestly protect Soviet interests."</p>
<p>Demanding a Prompt Reply: In conclusion, Karakhan requested the Japanese ambassador to provide a prompt reply. Ota promised to immediately convey Karakhan's views to the Japanese government. At the same time, Karakhan handed Ota a memorandum regarding the recent disputed issue of locomotives and cars. (TASS Dispatch, Eighteenth Day)</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Ignore It: (Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has not yet received the lengthy note verbale submitted by the Soviet Russian government authorities to the Japanese ambassador to Russia regarding the China Eastern Railway incident and does not know its contents. If it is a protest to Japan regarding the China Eastern Railway issue, Japan, considering the issue to be one between the "puppet state" and Russia and unrelated to Japan, plans to dismiss the protest without consideration. If it is a request for Japan to mediate, then it may consider appropriate measures. (Jiji Dispatch, Eighteenth Day)</p>
<p>Denying Manipulation of White Russians: (Tokyo) The Soviet ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Uchida at the Japanese Foreign Ministry today to negotiate the dispute over the China Eastern Railway. It is reported that the Soviet ambassador expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese government's repeated instigation of puppet organizations to provoke Russia. The Soviet Union deeply hopes to resolve the dispute peacefully and stated that Japan should immediately cease manipulating the anti-Soviet activities of the White Russians, otherwise it would be cause for concern in the diplomatic relations between the two countries. Foreign Minister Uchida replied that the Japanese side also hopes to resolve the China Eastern Railway issue peacefully, but the matter concerns the "puppet state" and Japan cannot act alone. As for the use of White Russians, it is not the case. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, based on Far Eastern peace, is willing to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union. (Hualian Dispatch, Eighteenth Day)</p>
<p>The Puppet State Takes Advantage of Power: (Harbin) The Soviet side claims ownership of the locomotive, but this locomotive, although ordered from the United States during the Kerensky government era, was not delivered to Soviet Russia when the Russian Revolution broke out. The United States delivered it to the anti-Soviet side, and the factory equipment and installation costs were all paid by the China Eastern Railway. Therefore, it is actually owned by the China Eastern Railway. Now, the Soviet side has opened it into Russian territory without any notification, which is clearly infringing on the sovereignty of the "puppet state." The "puppet state" is preparing to thoroughly condemn it and expresses a strong determination. Negotiations will not be accepted under any circumstances until the damage is resolved. (Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the Soviet Russian government's protest on the Eastern Railway issue, the (puppet) Ministry of Communications will issue a rebuttal reply, pointing out that it is unreasonable, and will lodge a serious protest against the Soviet side's arbitrary removal of freight cars and similar illegal acts. The protest letter will be delivered to Koznetov by Li Shaogeng, the Director of the Eastern Railway, today. (Dentsu Dispatch, Eighteenth Day)</p>
<p>Japan Covets the China Eastern Railway: (Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun reports that, according to reliable sources, it received a telegram from Harbin today stating that Soviet Russia is now preparing to sell its interests in the China Eastern Railway to Japan for 100 million yuan. It is reported that a certain important person is currently in Harbin negotiating the sale of Soviet Russian interests with the "Manchukuo" authorities. Today, the spokesman of the Ministry of the Army denied that this was the case and made a half-humorous statement, saying, "If this statement is indeed true, 'Manchukuo' will also be unable to purchase this. If Soviet Russia wants to sell its interests, it must lower the selling price." (Reuters Dispatch, Eighteenth Day)</p>
<h3 id="e49">Russia-Japan Fishing Issue <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Situation is Extremely Dangerous</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reported on the 14th that, according to information obtained by the Hakodate Maritime Police Department, the Soviet Russian government is repeatedly blocking the fish passages of Russian state-owned fishing grounds by deploying nets by Japanese fishing boats outside the three nautical miles off the coast of Kamchatka, causing serious damage to Russian fishermen. Since this year, areas within twelve nautical miles from various locations in our country have been recognized as Russian territorial waters, and Japanese fishing boats will be expelled. This project was approved by the Far Eastern Executive Committee and notified to the Japanese government. That is, the Russian domestic law will be implemented, but the Japanese government authorities believe that areas outside three nautical miles from the coast belong to the high seas and reject this notice. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has instructed 400 fishing boats carrying 7,000 fishermen to continue fishing in the Sea of Kamchatka. If Russia insists on the twelve-nautical-mile claim and expels Japanese fishing boats, it will use force to deal with them. It is reported that Russia has dispatched armed surveillance ships such as the Alostny to patrol the Sea of Kamchatka. Therefore, Japanese fishing boats are also equipped with machine guns and rifles, preparing to fight the surveillance ships. On the 12th, Pacific Fisheries Commissioner Miura and others reported to the Hakodate Maritime Police Department that they were about to use force, and the situation was extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>Organized by Japanese Special Service Department</p>
<p>Resettled Along the China Eastern Railway</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the September 18th Incident, Japanese special service agencies specifically studied manipulating White Russians to resist the Soviet Union. White Russian leader Semyonov had close relations with the Kwantung Army Special Service Department. The number of White Russians wandering around the world who have flowed into the three eastern provinces has reached 200,000, of whom former soldiers of the Russian Empire make up the majority. After several contacts with White Russian leaders, the Japanese Special Service Department decided to organize former soldiers of the Russian Empire and young White Russians into immigrant groups, give them strict military training, and scatter them in several groups to key military locations along the China Eastern Railway. In peacetime, they will support themselves by farming, and in wartime, they will be used as vanguards for invading Russia. Women, children, and the elderly are allowed to engage in commerce in the cities. Recently, taking advantage of the disputes over the China Eastern Railway issue, they plan to use force to expel Soviet personnel and replace them with White Russian personnel.

<h3 id="e51">US Secretary of War Advocates Great Naval Policy <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Maintaining the Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>Existing Strength More Than Sufficient</p>
<p>Promoting Far Eastern Policy</p>
<p>Great Navy Necessary for Success</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, telegraphed the Japanese Foreign Ministry yesterday from the United States, stating that the US Secretary of War has consistently advocated a policy of self-reliance and recently published an article in a naval magazine entitled "Never Forget." The article advocated expanding the US Navy and abandoning the previous cautious approach. The sudden change in the attitude of US naval figures has caused great consternation in the Japanese Foreign Ministry, which has reportedly reported to the cabinet to prepare countermeasures (Associated Press Dispatch, Eighteenth Day) Washington-The current naval policy of the United States government is to actively expand to the holding levels permitted by the London Treaty. The basis of its advocacy is that the naval powers of the world are currently divided into three pillars: the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. To seek a balance of power and maintain peace, all parties must not lack the treaty tonnage of naval power. If the purpose of the United States is only to implement the Caribbean policy (surrounding the Caribbean Sea southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and using military force to interfere in the internal affairs of countries such as Nicaragua, Panama, and Cuba) and maintain the Monroe Doctrine, then its existing naval power is already sufficient. If it needs to further promote the Far Eastern policy, then the implementation of a great naval policy is necessary for success. The naval power of the United States is now behind Japan, so Japan dares to run rampant in Manchuria. From the perspective of implementing national policy, the existence or absence of a great navy is the key to the success or failure of the Far Eastern policy. Rear Admiral Black, Director of the Bureau of Ships, forcefully stated that in order to maintain overseas trade and the dignity of a first-class country, the United States absolutely needs to maintain the world's top naval power. The extent of the US naval expansion must be based on: 1. The protection of overseas trade; 2. The defense of scattered American colonies overseas; 3. The key to maintaining the implementation of national policy; 4. Obtaining a balanced peace based on the treaty tonnage of the three major naval powers; 5. Guaranteeing victory in future naval battles. The so-called war here is undoubtedly targeting Japan. (World News Agency)</p>

<p>(London) Conservative newspapers have repeatedly issued criticisms, saying that the Chinese government cannot govern all of its territory. The "Daily Telegraph" published an article this morning regarding the pirate attack on a customs patrol boat near Macau yesterday, saying it is another example of the Nanjing government's lack of power. It stated, "This incident is not surprising. Robbery and murder are common occurrences on Chinese seas and inland rivers. They are nothing new. Historically, bandits have been a problem along the Chinese coast, and in the last three years, they have become increasingly rampant, causing harm to the world. The unfortunate Chinese people have suffered even more. This is due to China's failure to organize an effective and stable government," and so on. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>House of Representatives Passes Granting Special Powers to the President</p>
<p>Severe Penalties for Violating the Law</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 17th - Today, the House of Representatives passed a bill granting the President the power to prohibit the export of arms to aggressor nations. Anyone who violates this law will be subject to a fine of US$10,000 or imprisonment for two years.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 17th - When the US arms embargo bill was passed in the House of Representatives today by a vote of 252 to 110, many members strongly stated that the passage of this bill was tantamount to coercing Japan, but the bill was eventually passed. The bill has now been sent to the Senate. Administrative members have requested the Senate to vote on it as soon as possible. The administrative members also explained to the Senate that the United States is the only country in the world whose administrative organs lack the power to embargo. The current US action is directly based on the UK's temporary ban on arms exports to China and Japan. When the UK lifted the ban, the British Ambassador to the US, Lindsay, visited the US State Department to inquire about the US's attitude towards this matter. Perhaps Lindsay at that time expressed to the US authorities his support for the embargo. Whether this is true or not, the US government's arms embargo bill was submitted to Congress the day after Lindsay's visit to the State Department. Furthermore, there was a similar proposal from the cabinet side during the Hoover era, but the scope required by Hoover at that time was extremely narrow, limited only to the Latin American countries of South America. The powers now requested by Roosevelt are broader and not limited to the Western Hemisphere. In the future, the United States will unite with the United Kingdom, and all countries at war or about to be at war will be subject to the same embargo treatment. During the House debate today, Representative Tinkham declared that the passage of this bill would harm Japan's feelings. He, as the leader of the Republican opposition, expressed his opposition and wanted to amend several clauses of the original bill in order to maintain the neutrality of the United States. These amendments, if passed, would greatly restrict the President's powers, but they were all rejected one by one.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 18th - According to a New York Times dispatch from Washington, the Senate rejected a bill to mint silver coins at a ratio of sixteen to one with gold coins, because President Roosevelt must negotiate an international agreement on the bimetallic standard with the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. The purpose of this agreement is to have a stable exchange rate between the currencies of various countries, so as to avoid the constant fluctuations in international exchange rates. Secretary of State Hull has discussed with British Ambassador Lindsay the methods to accomplish this. If a multilateral treaty can be concluded, it will be sufficient to encourage international purchases of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Lawyers Defend Wick's Case, British Technicians Will Receive Lighter Sentences <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Anglo-Russian Diplomatic Relations Expected to Ease</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 17th - The lawyers for the Russian defendants, Guzev, Sokolov, and Valeni, Kashnatsiev, strongly defended their clients during the continued hearing of the Wick Company technicians case tonight, hoping to shift all the responsibility to the British technicians, saying that before the court judges this case, please do not forget that Guzev was not an active counter-revolutionary before meeting MacDonald and Thornton, and that MacDonald and Sangdon denied their confessions, saying that they signed them under pressure, while Guzev and others admitted it without hesitation, so their crimes should be reduced. Furthermore, Sokolov is only a second-class saboteur, and a ten-year prison sentence is sufficient. As for Valeni, it is hoped that the court will give him a chance to reform himself and serve Soviet Russia. The Russian lawyer Shi Huazi, representing the Russian defendants Solin, Klasningov, and Sokolujin, argued in court that Sokolujin's crime was indeed serious, but he was surrounded by anti-Russian and saboteurs, and his circumstances were excusable. Klasningov himself confessed his guilt and expressed remorse, asking the court to spare his life. The lawyer's words were not touching and were not noticed by the court. Observers coughed deliberately to stop him, and even laughed wildly. Pinas, who defended Shebert and others, accused Nordhua of inducing his client to engage in espionage and falling into crime, asking the court to consider the youth of his client and give him leniency. Smirnov, MacDonald's lawyer, spoke movingly, saying that MacDonald came from a humble background and was disabled. He came to Russia to serve, but he did not know the prohibitions of the country. He happened to meet the insidious Guzev, who was a villain and would sell his country for a few hundred rubles. MacDonald worked for the Wick Company and had been trained since childhood to maintain the company's honor and interests. The company instructed him to collect information, so he did so as instructed. MacDonald was a subordinate. It would be unfair to punish him in the same way as the superiors, Monkhouse and Thornton. MacDonald did commit a serious crime, but he solemnly declared that he would not do it again. In the future, MacDonald can serve Soviet Russia. The court adjourned at 10:15 tonight and will resume the hearing at 10:00 AM on the 18th. Reuters reporters learned that the defendants may be punished as follows: MacDonald and Thornton, each with a ten-year prison sentence; Monkhouse, a three-year prison sentence; Keshni and Nordhua released on bail; Gregory acquitted. The Russian defendants, Guzev and Lovanov, may be sentenced to death, while other Russians will be sentenced to imprisonment. It is expected that the British defendants' sentences can be reduced to exile, because Prosecutor Vyshinsky said that Russia does not want bloodshed and revenge. The British here have a lot of comforting criticism of the prosecutor's moderate claims and the UK's actions regarding trade with Russia, and it is expected that a moderate verdict will be an important element in the future diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia.</p>
<p>Last Trial Situation The case against six British and twelve Russian people of Wick Company opened the final day of trial today. There were many onlookers in the court because it was expected that the lawyers of the British defendants, Brown and others, would have a debate. Brown said: The client Thornton has withdrawn his testimony to the political detective bureau, and now I will explain everything so that the judges understand that Thornton is actually innocent. It is now pointed out that Thornton induced sabotage, who had already been engaged in sabotage work before meeting Thornton. They are traitors to Russia and gave news to Thornton in exchange for money. Thornton expected that the Soviet Union would compete with Britain, so he wanted to get economic news. What he unwittingly funded to obtain was economic news rather than espionage. Bribery is more common in Britain than in Russia, Brown said after speaking for 45 minutes, Nordhua's lawyer Damashevsky continued to speak, saying that Nordhua did not have much contact with Lobanov and his sabotage party, and MacDonald and others did not prove that Nordhua was a saboteur, so he asked the court to release Nordhua, the hope of liberation after the application by his lawyer, Gregory's release is really promising, so his lawyer did not say much, Keshni's lawyer Lidoff denied each of the accusations, saying that the documentary evidence was insufficient, Mr. K. was confident in himself, and had long denied everything."</p>
<p>After that, there was a surprising statement. When Comodoreff spoke to defend Wick's manager, Monkhouse, he said that Mr. Meng was charged with three things: espionage, slacking, and bribery, but Mr. Meng only denied bribery. Mr. Meng was guilty, and it was difficult for me to defend him. I don't want to shift the crime to others, Mr. Meng and Thornton have been in Russia for many years and have a close relationship with each other, but according to the evidence, Thornton has never informed Mr. Meng of his activities, after the lawyers spoke, the defendants successively陈诉供词, repeatedly changed his confession, and this time also admitted his guilt, saying, "I am guilty, what else can I say, Nordhua then said, I am innocent, and I have always been a friend of the Soviet Union, Keshni also said, I am innocent, no matter what the sentence is, I will always be an honest person, Monkhouse said, Some people say that I cheated the British government about the 18-hour questioning, but in fact this statement is not true, I was misunderstood, and I do not admit guilt to all three points, said Sangdon, I stated that I was not guilty at the beginning of the trial, and I still am like that," All the Russian defendants then confessed their guilt, The court adjourned at 3:30 p.m. to consider the verdict, (Reuters, Moscow, 18th)</p>

At a time when the World Economic Conference and its preliminary discussions are seeking to eliminate international commercial barriers, India has canceled the trade agreement with Japan and implemented anti-dumping measures, which is a sigh for the future of international trade. Please pay attention to the issue of canceling the trade agreement and adopting anti-dumping legislation, as this move may destroy the economic ties between the two countries, and so on.</p>

<p>Saito's Attitude Turns Active</p>
<p>Holding a Resolve to Dissolve Parliament</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 18th - Prime Minister Saito's instructions at the local governors' meeting showed no intention of resigning, giving a great impulse to all parties. Although the surface seems calm, most of them are surprised and think it is necessary to change the future countermeasures. Generally speaking, Prime Minister Saito regards the purification of the political world as an important mission, and may inevitably dissolve the parliament. Even if Finance Minister Takahashi resigns, he will supplement it and reorganize the cabinet. At this time, if the Seiyukai cabinet members generally retreat, they will also be supplemented. If the Seiyukai holds an opposing attitude in the next regular parliamentary session, the parliament will be dissolved. It is said that Prime Minister Saito has indeed made this decision, but it is doubtful whether the surrounding situation will allow the Prime Minister's decision. From the Prime Minister's instructions at the local governors' meeting, it can be seen that the political situation will become more complicated again.</p>

<p>Tang Yulin's troops are west of Fengning.</p>
<p>Sun Zhanying's troops are in the vicinity of Chicheng.</p>
<p>(Beiping dispatch) Since the fall of Rehe, various armies have concentrated in the vicinity of the Chahar-Rehe border, actively replenishing their forces in preparation for a counteroffensive. However, due to the blocked transportation and lack of news from the area, Mr. Wu Lei-yuan, the commander-in-chief of the 5th Route of the National Anti-Japanese Army in Rehe, returned to Beiping yesterday from western Fengning. His account of the situation is quite practical and is recorded below for the reference of those who are interested:</p>
<p>Mr. Wu said, "During the recent westward invasion by the Japanese, the First Division of our army, led by Liu Pin, engaged in combat with the enemy in Chaoyang, suffering heavy losses after several hand-to-hand battles. Later, due to changes in strategy, the National Army withdrew, and all the cavalry of that division also retreated westward, providing cover. Currently, the brigade of Tan Pingfang from that division has reached the area of Aobao Temple, northeast of Dolun, where they are confronting the enemy. There are occasional small skirmishes at the outposts. As for the Second Division of our army, led by Xu Xiyao, they were originally in Chifeng. After the fall of Chifeng, they retreated westward with the 41st Army and are now stationed in the area of Sanyuhao, Sanzueshan, and Qipanshan, east of Dolun. I personally led the various units of the Third Division and arrived in the area of Wudaoying, west of Fengning, on March 26th. At that time, the commander of the 41st Army, Sun, was stationed in Dagetown, so I personally went to discuss the concentration point of our army and seek liaison. I was warmly welcomed and generously assisted by Commander Sun. I also met with Feng Yangtian, the Chief of Staff, who issued a notice to all units to adopt unified action. At the same time, it was decided to station troops in the Lama Mountain, Xishuigou, Ganshuigou, and Datan areas. Unexpectedly, the situation at the front changed a few days ago, and Fengning fell on March 28th. At that time, our army engaged with the enemy at the Toutaoyingzi north of Fengning, fighting fiercely for two hours. Due to being outnumbered, we suffered more than twenty casualties. At this time, Commander Sun moved westward from Dagetown. On the morning of the 29th, two Japanese planes bombed Dagetown, destroying several civilian houses and injuring two villagers. On the afternoon of the same day, I led my troops to move westward in coordination with the main force. We are now concentrated in the Pingdingshan, Yunwugou, and Lamagou areas, strictly defending. West of Fengning, there are also troops of Tang Yulin. When a portion of our army arrived in Datan, we sent a liaison officer to contact Cui, the Chief of Staff of Tang, and Tang, the section chief. Cui and Tang said that they represented Chairman Tang and were willing to do their utmost to assist and to notify all armies to take coordinated action. Currently, Chicheng, Zhanyuan, and Yanqing are all garrisoned by the 41st Army. Commander Sun himself has now arrived in Chicheng. At present, a large army is gathering at the front, and all units have established liaison and set up defensive works. However, there is a severe lack of supplies and clothing. I have come to Beiping specifically to handle rear supply and military affairs, and I urgently need to seek instructions from Chairman He, so I will return to the front soon," he said. (16th)</p>

<p>The Hunan Army Advances Towards Ji'an After Capturing Yongxin.</p>
<p>The Central Route Army in Eastern Jiangxi Recovers Yongfeng.</p>
<p>Zhu De and Mao Zedong Have a Tendency to Flee into Ningdu.</p>
<p>(Nanchang dispatch) The Hunan Army has entered Jiangxi to assist in suppressing bandits. Those who have arrived in western and northern Jiangxi, in addition to the original troops of Tao Guang, have recently been joined by the troops of Wang Dongyuan, Peng Weiren, Chen Guangzhong, and others. The 　　division in the Wanzai area has already contacted the Hubei Army and is jointly attacking the forces of Kong Hechong from three sides, having recovered Xiaoyuan. Those on the Jiangxi-Hunan border have already contacted the Guangdong Army and are jointly suppressing the forces of Li Tianzhu along with Wang Maode and others, having also recovered Ninggang and Lianhua. In order to concentrate the forces in Jiangxi to suppress Zhu De and Mao Zedong, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has decided to transfer the responsibility for suppressing bandits in the border areas of Jiangxi to the neighboring provinces bordering Jiangxi. West of the Gan River is the responsibility of Hunan's He Jian, and he has been telegraphed to Jiangxi to give instructions. He arrived in Xun on the 14th and took a special train to Nanchang that night, arriving at 10 p.m. and staying at the Jiangxi Grand Hotel. According to He, "I came to Jiangxi this time upon receiving Chairman Chiang's telegram to ask for instructions on the plan to jointly suppress the communist bandits on the Jiangxi-Hunan border, and to report on the military and political situation in Hunan. The communists in Hunan have been largely suppressed. I am now supervising the troops to enter Jiangxi and engage in joint suppression. Liu Jianxu has already gone to Wanzai from Changsha to supervise the division," and so on. On the morning of the 15th, He went to the Science Museum to meet Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang hosted a reception for He that evening at his headquarters, with He Guoguang and others as companions, and they discussed the joint suppression plan for Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei. It did not end until late at night. He also visited Xiong Shihui, He Guoguang, and others to exchange views on bandit suppression. It is said that he is scheduled to return to Hunan today (16th) or tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Hunan Army's bandit suppression in Jiangxi has progressed quite rapidly recently. According to telegrams from Chen Guangzhong and Wang Dongyuan, they captured the only base of the bandits, Yongxin County, on the 13th, completely destroying more than ten institutions such as the headquarters of the false Jiangxi-Hunan Border Military Region, the false Eighth Army headquarters, the false Jiangxi Provincial Government, the Yongxin Soviet, and military hospitals. However, Yongxin has been occupied by bandits for six years, and the suffering of the people and the destruction are self-evident. Division Commander Chen has telegraphed the provincial government and Commissioner Li of the Tenth District to send people to deal with the aftermath. As for Li Tianzhu's bandits, they are actively fleeing towards the Yuan River and Gan River, with the loss of Yongxin, Ninggang, and Lianhua on the Jiangxi-Hunan border. The Hunan and Hubei armies are also pursuing and suppressing the bandits. The vanguard of the 　　division has reached Ji'an. It is said that Ji'an will also be handed over to the Hunan Army to be responsible for it, so that the troops originally stationed in Ji'an can be transferred to the east bank of the Gan River to besiege Zhu De and Mao Zedong. As for eastern Jiangxi, since the Central Route Army recovered Xingan, the false 135th Army Corps in the central section of the Gan River has retreated to the southeast. A certain division recovered Yongfeng County on the 15th. The false 21st and 2nd bandit armies retreated to the west of Chongren and Le'an, echoing the bandits south of Yihuang. A certain department led by me, advancing south from Yongfeng and Le'an, has already passed Zhukeng. The capture of Le'an County is imminent. Zhu De and Mao Zedong's false First Front Army have a tendency to flee into Ningdu. (April 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Communist Banditry Re-ignites in Hubei Province <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xiangqian's Troops Harass Macheng and Huang'an Counties</p>
<p>Fan Xiji Urges Sichuan and Hunan Armies to Jointly Suppress He Long</p>
<p>(Hankou dispatch) After suffering a defeat last year, the main force of the communist bandits in Hubei Province fled elsewhere, while sporadic bandits remained hidden in various places, attempting to revive. However, due to the strict defenses of the stationed troops and local militias, they were unable to succeed. This year, as the Japanese invaders have become more aggressive, the authorities have concentrated their efforts on defending against the invaders and saving the nation. As a result, there has been some troop movement in Hubei Province. He Long's remnant bandits were able to return to western Hubei, and Xu Xiangqian's remaining bandits in Hubei also took the opportunity to rise up in the northeast. Last month, Xu's bandits gathered scattered elements into an organized force, unearthed hidden weapons, and seized firearms from the stationed troops and local militias, totaling about 6,000 men. They were organized into the false 24th, 25th, and 28th armies, occupying the southwest of Lihuang County (formerly Jinjiazai), the northwest of Macheng County, and the area between Huang'an and Jingfu (formerly Xinxie) counties. They also moved back and forth in the area bordering the south of Shangcheng and the north of Macheng, concentrating their forces to launch fierce attacks on the stationed troops and local militias. As a result, the Qinkang area of Shangcheng, and the Dongyizhou and Futian River areas of Macheng were all ravaged. The National Army division stationed there was unable to gather at the same time due to the vastness of the area under its defense, nor could it maintain a line of defense at every point, allowing the bandits to operate. On the 17th, according to a telephone report from Song's troops, the bridges along the Han'an highway were destroyed by the bandits, and traffic was suddenly cut off. The severity of the situation can be imagined. Currently, the 　　and other units are separately suppressing the bandits. The local militias of Jingfu, Lihuang, Huang'an, and Macheng counties have also been organized by Zheng, the county magistrate of Macheng, to implement joint defense, and have requested the headquarters to issue ammunition to facilitate joint suppression.</p>
<p>In western Hubei, He's bandits still occupy Wuling Pass, and Fan Xiji is still in Enshi. Although there are widespread rumors of a three-pronged general offensive against the bandits, there are no confirmed reports of contact. Based on speculation, it may still be in the planning stage. There are several reasons why Fan's troops are slow to launch an offensive: first, the mountainous roads are rugged and inconvenient for troop movement; second, the roads are remote, and food supplies are insufficient; and third, friendly armies from Hunan and Sichuan have been slow to arrive and have failed to establish liaison. Chen Quzhen's troops of the Hunan Army have been searching for scattered bandits near the Hunan border and have not yet moved towards Hubei. Although one regiment of Wang Lingji's troops of the Sichuan Army has been mobilized, they have not dared to advance deeply due to their limited strength. On the 14th, Fan convened a military and political meeting in Shi, attended by the county magistrates of Enshi, Hefeng, Badong, Xianfeng, Lichuan, Jianshi, and Laifeng, as well as officers above the rank of regimental commander of the stationed troops. It concluded on the 16th. It is said that the meeting discussed the reform of general administration in each county and the progress of bandit suppression. At the same time, it abolished exorbitant taxes and prohibited the troops from harassing the people. It is said that Fan has been ordered by Chiang to also be responsible for rectifying general administration. However, the stalemate between the troops and the bandits is ultimately not a good policy. Fan has now telegraphed the Sichuan and Hunan armies, urging them to set out as soon as possible and agree on a joint suppression to achieve the effect of encirclement. (April 17th)</p>

<p>Minister of Finance T.V. Soong, representing China at the Washington Economic Conference, set sail for the United States yesterday afternoon aboard the Dollar Line's President Jackson. It is expected that the ship will arrive in Seattle in early May and then proceed to Washington. No fewer than three to four hundred people from military, political, commercial, industrial, Chinese, and Western circles in the city, as well as relatives and friends of the Soong family, went to the pier to see him off. Soong also issued a written statement to the press on board. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Photo by Xu Tianzhang: T.V. Soong and those seeing him off)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Customs</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Customs Wharf and the police specially dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to provide security in the vicinity. Wen Hongen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, personally led armed police officers to maintain order at the wharf. All irrelevant people were not allowed to enter. The security was exceptionally tight. However, those who came to see off were allowed to participate without a pass. Therefore, despite the light rain and the chilly spring air, those seeing off arrived one after another, with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Those Seeing Him Off</p>
<p>Tang Hai'an, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, arrived earliest. Others included the French Consul General in Shanghai, Meriel; the commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, Kyle Gao; Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua and his wife; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie; Vice Minister of Finance Zou Lin; Mayor Wu Tiecheng; Director of Security Yang Hu; Government Advisor Sir Robert Hotung; Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Finance Zhang Shouyong; Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Zhou Xiangxian; Yang Dezhao, representative of Chen Jitang; Xiao Zhenying, representative of Song Zheyuan; Liu Yunfang, representative of Wang Zhengting; General Customs Commissioner Frederick Maze; Director of the Mint Lu Xuepu; General Zhu Qinglan, member of the Flood Relief Committee; Xi Dejiong and Zhou Bangjun of the National Economic Council; Guo Dehua, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance; He Shaofen, staff member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Wen Yingxing, commander of the Revenue Police Corps; Li Fuxun and Xu Xinliu, representatives of the banking community; Wen Lant亭, representative of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; Yang Jie, president of the Army University; Liu Hongsheng, Tang Shoumin, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, and other business leaders; as well as Mrs. Zhang Leyi, T.V. Soong's wife, and his children Liangzi and An, totaling three to four hundred people.</p>
<p>Ferries and Flower Baskets</p>
<p>The Customs specially prepared three small launches, Qianhui, Kesheng, and Mianli, as well as a small launch, Lifei, from the Dredging Bureau, and a ferry from the Dollar Line for Soong and those seeing him off to ride on. Soong and his family were on the Jinghui launch. The cabin was filled with about a hundred flower baskets presented by various sectors. Representatives of the Postal Workers' Union also held a white cloth banner with the words "Welcome Minister Soong to the Washington Economic Conference."</p>
<p>Boarding Situation</p>
<p>At 10:45 a.m., Soong, accompanied by his wife Zhang Leyi and their son, arrived at the Customs Wharf by car. Sir Robert Hotung also arrived at this time. Soong shook hands with each of those seeing him off, repeatedly saying goodbye, and his attitude was exceptionally humble. At the same time, the Mingxing Company and Paramount Company competed to film Soong. Then, Tang Hai'an led Soong and others to board the Jinghui launch. A portion of those seeing him off also boarded other ferries to accompany him. They docked alongside the President Jackson at Bailianjing at 11:15 a.m., and then boarded the ship one after another. At that time, it was exactly 11:15 a.m. His acquaintances warmly greeted him and congratulated him on the success of his trip. Soong expressed his pleasure in accepting it. It was not until 11:50 a.m. that those seeing him off left the ship and returned. The President Jackson set sail at noon at 12:00 p.m. Those who traveled with Soong included Pei Songsun, president of the Bank of China; Young, advisor to the Ministry of Finance; Qin Yingchun, counselor of the Ministry of Finance; as well as secretaries Huang Chundao and Cai Shousheng; Wei Wenbin, secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the United States; and attendants Zhang Rong and Huang Zhenlin.　　Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>At the time of departure, Soong delivered a written speech on board, saying that the majority of the issues to be discussed at the World Economic Conference are related to the relations between countries, but also have a variety of significant relationships with China. Therefore, Ambassador Shi to the United States first sent a telegram to him, inviting him to attend. Later, Ambassadors Yan and Gu also sent telegrams, hoping that he would attend. At the same time, the government also decided to appoint him to go because the economic situation worldwide is in great difficulty and not easily restored due to the various unresolved problems between countries. I firmly believe that international problems can only be resolved through sincere cooperation to achieve satisfactory goals for the happiness of the world and the interests of our country. China must do its utmost to support all countries at this conference to achieve the complete objectives of this meeting. As for the other main points, I have already discussed them fully at the farewell banquet for the public associations yesterday, so I will not repeat them. This trip will last about two months. I am grateful to you, my friends and relatives, for sending me off. I cannot thank you all individually. I hope you will guide me at any time and inform me of domestic news from time to time. I will also report the progress of the meeting to you.</p>

<p>Opposing the Management, Inspection, or Supervision of Factories</p>
<p>Hiring a Qualified Chinese Auditor to Audit Accounts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, yesterday, based on the resolutions of the Association's Delegates' Meeting on April 12 and the reply from the Shanghai Real Estate Association, sent three important letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Factory Management Rights</p>
<p>To the Director: It is found that at the Delegates' Meeting of this Association on April 12, regarding your Council's plan to manage factories within the concession, it was resolved that, "According to the opinion of this Delegates' Meeting, most of the work in the factories in the Public Concession is done by Chinese workers. If factory management regulations are established in addition to the labor laws and regulations promulgated by the Chinese government, it will harm Chinese sovereignty. Therefore, it is resolved that any proposal or land regulations and or amendments to the attached laws that grant the Municipal Council the right to manage, inspect, or supervise all factories within the concession are considered an act of exceeding authority and will not be agreed to." I am sending this letter to your Council for your information and action.</p>
<p>Chinese Auditor</p>
<p>To the Director: It is found that at the Delegates' Meeting of this Association on April 12, regarding the addition of a Chinese auditor to your Council, it was resolved that, "According to the opinion of this Delegates' Meeting, in order to satisfy the wishes of our Chinese citizens and adapt to the needs of the environment, it is necessary for the Shanghai Municipal Council to hire a qualified Chinese person to audit accounts. This Association hereby authorizes the Municipal Council to proceed with all necessary procedures so that the appointment of a Chinese auditor can be realized as soon as possible." I am sending this letter to your Council for your information and action.　　Chinese Committee Member for Land</p>
<p>To the Director: It is found that one of the two Chinese members of your Council's Land Committee for the years 1933-1934 has already been appointed by this Association's Delegates' Meeting, Dr. Chen Tingrui, and a letter has been sent to your Council. The other member should be appointed by the Chinese landowners' association. This Association informed the Shanghai Real Estate Association on April 7 to elect. Later, we received a reply from the association, nominating Mr. Feng Bingnan as the member of the association elected by the Chinese landowners. I am sending this letter for your information and action.</p>
<h3 id="e101">All Agencies Hoisted Flags Yesterday <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Commemorating the Establishment of the Capital in Nanjing</p>
<p>Yesterday was the sixth anniversary of the National Government's establishment of its capital in Nanjing. The Municipal Government of this city specially ordered all its subordinate agencies and schools to hoist flags in celebration to commemorate the occasion. However, due to the time of national crisis, there was no extravagance, so no ceremony was held.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Public Performance Yesterday <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Morning Performance at the Bund Caused Traffic Congestion</p>
<p>Japanese Also Went to See the Afternoon Performance at Longhua</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Aviation Company's newly imported Best Eagle brand fighter plane, sold by US Transportation in Shanghai, has been test flying at Longhua for several days. The pilot is the famous American aviator Mr. Du Lide, who has won a flying medal in the United States. He performed separately yesterday morning and afternoon. Although it was drizzling in the afternoon, no fewer than a thousand Chinese and Western spectators went to Longhua. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Aircraft Structure: The fighter plane is a biplane single-seater with a fuselage length of approximately 40 meters. The fuselage is brown, and the wings are painted yellow. The aircraft is manufactured by the American Curtiss factory and is equipped with a 700-horsepower engine. It can be equipped with a machine gun for combat.</p>
<p>Bund Performance: At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, the sound of the engine was heard in the sky over the city. Shortly after, Mr. Du's plane flew around the Bund and the Huangpu River for a week, and then began the performance, such as flying straight up and sideways. There were many forms, and even several times, the aircraft flew with its belly facing the sky, which was truly not easy. This caused the general public to stop and watch. There were especially many spectators on the Bund, and the road was almost blocked. Everyone was full of praise. After half an hour, he flew back to Longhua and landed.</p>
<p>Longhua Test Flight: At 4:30 p.m., Mr. Du continued the test flight at the Longhua Airport. Since the people of Shanghai had not seen the full picture of the morning performance, even though it was drizzling and the road was muddy, those who went to Longhua in the afternoon were still very crowded. Students from a certain girls' school also took field trucks to the scene, which was especially noteworthy. Three Japanese men, all dressed in civilian clothes, watched the show in the field and silently observed the planes. The car they were riding in belonged to the headquarters of the Marine Corps. It is thought that they were Japanese soldiers, who admired Mr. Du's flying, so they went to watch in civilian clothes. There were more than a hundred Chinese and Western cars in the field, and the number of people was about a thousand. At four o'clock, the plane was originally parked in front of the China Aviation Company's factory warehouse. Another engineer opened and tested the motor. After testing for half an hour, Mr. Du put on a white aviation suit, put on a parachute, and boarded the plane. He was towed out of the airfield by car, and then he soared into the sky, performing various techniques. Finally, the pilot stretched his hands out of the plane. The film company and photographers went to take pictures and then dispersed. It is said that the plane is the latest American yellow biplane single-seater fighter, with 700 horsepower. The plane can be equipped with a machine gun, but it was not installed because it is now a performance test flight.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Yangtze River Train Ferry Has Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Postponed for Three Months Before Sailing to Beijing</p>
<p>The Yangtze River train ferry, which was ordered by the Ministry of Transportation from the United Kingdom and is used to connect the Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing lines, sailed into the Huangpu River a few days ago and dropped anchor outside the Zhoujiazuijiao at the 39th and 40th buoys. These buoys are flying red flags. It has been a little over two months since it set sail on February 15. The ship is 372 feet long, 54 and a half feet at its widest, and can carry 1,480 tons. There are three sets of tracks on the deck, each 300 feet long, which can accommodate three trains, each of which can pull seven cars. The car heads for the deck that are used to carry the cars are also manufactured in the United Kingdom and will be shipped soon. When the Yangtze River set sail from England, it had not yet been completed. The ship's speed can reach 12 and a half nautical miles per hour.

<p>Cable to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Trade Union cabled the National Government's Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating, "It is submitted that the Chinese Cotton Mill Association has illegally resolved to reduce working hours. We implore you to issue a clear order to stop it to protect the industry and maintain the livelihood of the workers. Our country's industry has always been dominated by silk and tea, which has a long history. Unfortunately, the holders of these industries are all greedy for short-term gains and produce crude and shoddy products, resulting in successive bankruptcies. The only surviving industry in our country is the cotton industry. If the authorities of the industry do not want to follow in the footsteps of silk and tea, how should they strive to make progress? However, it was reported on April 11 that the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, citing the dumping of foreign goods and overproduction, resolved that, starting from April 22, all Chinese cotton mills nationwide would uniformly reduce working hours by one day per week. If the resolution is violated, it will be punished according to regulations. We investigate that in recent years, due to the increasing foreign aggression and economic decline, all industries in our country have shown a downturn. The industry, which is the leader of all industries in our country, should make every effort to revitalize itself to compete with foreign goods, thereby saving the precarious industry. However, they have ignored the overall situation and acted in a way that is counterproductive, suddenly using the negative method of reducing working hours, so that foreign goods can have a greater opportunity to dump. Because after the Chinese factories reduce working hours, foreign goods will inevitably increase production and rush to manufacture. This reduction of working hours will not only affect the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers, but also be of utmost importance to the future of the industry. At this time of serious national crisis, labor and capital should sincerely join hands to save the country from danger. Moreover, the profit or loss of business depends on whether the management is appropriate. At present, factories such as Shenxin No. 1 Factory and Minsheng Factory all feel that production is insufficient. Based on this speculation, it is not necessarily the case that there are no factories in the country that are in the same situation as Shenxin. However, the association used the word "through" to force all cotton mills in the country to reduce working hours uniformly, which is extremely illegal. Moreover, the resolution has not been approved by the government, not only is it legally baseless, but it also despises the law. As an association, for the sake of the workers' lives and for the sake of Chinese industry, we are determined to oppose this illegal reduction of working hours. For this reason, we urgently submit this petition, imploring your ministry to issue a clear order to stop it in order to maintain the industry and resolve disputes, which would be of great benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Industry.</p>

As long as Shang Zhen has a breath left, I will never yield, and I pledge to continue to uphold my original intention and fight the enemy to the end.

<h3 id="e113">Taxpaying Westerners Held Annual Meeting and Special Meeting Today <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Discussing Amendments to the Land Regulations</p>
<p>Chinese Do Not Agree to Infringement on Our Sovereignty</p>
<p>Taxpaying Westerners in the Public Concession will hold their annual meeting at the Paramount Theatre on Nanjing West Road at 4 p.m. today. At 5 p.m., they will continue to hold a special meeting to amend the land regulations in an attempt to seize the right to manage factories. Citizens of the city, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, and the municipal government are all arguing on the basis of reason. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Today</p>
<p>The annual meeting of taxpaying Westerners has a total of eight proposals, including one new proposal: the Shanghai Municipal Council purchasing land to build a city hall and library. The special meeting of taxpaying Westerners has a proposal to amend the first line of Article 34 of the land regulations by adding the words "owning or occupying or opening factories or workshops or engaging in industry" after the words "within the concession" in an attempt to seize the right to manage factories. The Shanghai Municipal Council estimates that a total of more than 3,780 votes are eligible to attend the annual meeting of taxpaying Westerners. The quorum for the meeting is more than one-third, or 1,262 votes.</p>
<p>Our Attitude</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is expected that the amendment to Article 30 of the land regulations of the Public Concession will be passed at today's special meeting. It is rumored that the municipal government, for this issue, had Yu Hongjun, the secretary-general, make representations to the director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council in advance. However, when a reporter from the New Life News Agency interviewed Yu yesterday and asked about this matter, Yu denied that he had negotiated with Fei, and said that our side would wait until it was passed before discussing countermeasures. There is nothing to announce at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Shanghai Municipal Council Attempts to Seize the Right to Manage Factories Xie Fusheng Expresses His Opinion <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's new proposal to the special meeting of taxpaying Westerners that all factories in the concession must obtain licenses, Xie Fusheng sent a letter to the Western newspapers in English yesterday, holding a very insightful and appropriate view. The New Life News Agency has obtained the original and translated the gist as follows: "At the special meeting of taxpaying Westerners in the Public Concession on the 19th of this month (it is said that this special meeting requires 1,200 votes to reach the quorum), the Shanghai Municipal Council will propose to amend Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, intending to obtain unprecedented and unlimited powers at once through a very simple licensing method. All factory owners, factory buildings, work, and any industrial operations are under the Shanghai Municipal Council's flexible management. The taxpayers in the concession, regardless of Chinese or Western nationality, are focused on commercial interests, and they generally do not pay attention to the Yangjingbang Regulations that created this Public Concession and the Shanghai Municipal Council. If one were to analyze the wording of Article 34 of the Regulations, one would know that Article 34 has nothing to do with factory management. The article stipulates that "within the concession, all</p>
<p>markets, vegetable markets, clubs, boarding houses, music venues, theaters, circuses, cinemas, restaurants, entertainment venues, hotels, saunas, billiard rooms, skating rinks, dance halls, brothels:: milk sheds, laundries, bakeries, slaughterhouses, carriage lines, car lines, cattle sheds, sheep sheds, pig sheds must be licensed by the Shanghai Municipal Council before they can be opened. Also, all second-hand clothing stores, hotels, sales of various harmful drugs, poisons, and manufactured medicines, butcher shops, fruit stores, ice stores, vegetable stores, tobacco shops, and lottery shops must be licensed. Also, all small boats, equipped for personal use or for public transport, sampans, small steamers, ferries, horses, donkeys, mules, cars, motorized bicycles, rickshaws, hand-carried litters, carts, trams who own or operate these are liable to licensing. Anyone who keeps a dog is certainly among those required to be licensed. Under the regulations, the Shanghai Municipal Council has the right to formulate rules separately according to the circumstances for the handling of licenses, take security, and fine violators up to 100 yuan. Those who continue to violate the rules will be fined 25 yuan every 24 hours. What we can clearly see is that the rules on the license must be fully complied with by the licensee, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has the freedom to formulate these rules. I know that the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal will be justified by the fact that factories in the concession have suffered fires and the tragic deaths of workers, and will criticize the Chinese Factory Law as being too idealistic and unsuitable for the actual economic conditions of Chinese workers. However, the problem facing us today is not whether the factory conditions need to be relieved and improved to protect the health and safety of workers, and if only this is discussed, no one will object. However, what we should focus on is whether the Shanghai Municipal Council's attempt to obtain powers beyond the scope of municipal affairs by means of amending the regulations is simply a futile effort. If the Shanghai Municipal Council only needs to amend a completely irrelevant regulation to achieve its goal of managing factories, then the Shanghai Municipal Council is a hundred times smarter than Feitang. Feitang has spent several months studying the present and future problems of the Public Concession, and has also made some statements on China's Factory Law. Chapter 8 of his report says that "in all fairness, all the provisions of the Chinese Factory Law are too close to the ideal. The Factory Law may need to be amended in order to proceed gradually, but in any case, the concession authorities must not act independently in formulating any regulations on industry. For the sake of the concession authorities, the best way is to take the Chinese Factory Law as the standard, and formulate regulations within the scope of possibility, in order to make the regulations that factories in the concession and factories in the Chinese territory should comply with not too different." Furthermore, even if the special meeting on the 19th reaches a quorum and the new proposal is passed by the whole, the Shanghai Municipal Council's smooth sailing proposal may only be a self-consolation. Article 11 of the Yangjingbang Regulations says, "The board of directors has the right to formulate other regulations at any time in order to improve the various articles of the regulations." It also says, "The rules formulated by the board of directors must be approved by the ministers of the various countries stationed in Beijing, or a majority of them, and a special meeting of the tenant rate payers (i.e. the special meeting of the taxpayers) must be held to agree before they can be implemented." In short, the Shanghai Municipal Council's desire to obtain the right to manage factories can never arise under Article 34 or any regulations. The only way for the Shanghai Municipal Council is to amend the Yangjingbang Regulations, because in terms of what is clearly stipulated in the regulations, licensing and factory management are both illegal. Moreover, Article 27 of the Amendments to the Yangjingbang Regulations stipulates even more clearly that Feitang once told us, "Whenever there is a matter of amending the land regulations, it must still be handled through negotiations between China and the various countries. The Shanghai Municipal Council only needs to submit the suggestions for amendment."</p>

<p>The Hebei Association in Shanghai held a registration committee meeting yesterday afternoon. A total of 191 committee members attended, with Sun Hongyi presiding and Yu Jisu recording. Song Zheyuan's representatives, Xiao Xiange and Sun Longji, also braved the rain to attend. The meeting began at 2 p.m. with formalities. The chairman first introduced Xiao and Sun to the audience, expressed welcome, and expressed gratitude to Song's army for their hard fighting and sacrifice in protecting North China. Then, Xiao was invited to speak about the bitter fighting in Xifengkou for a month. The scene was tragic and the whole atmosphere was somber, with some even weeping. The most heroic acts were the killing of the enemy outside Xifengkou and the seven entries and exits in the battle for Haiyangzhen. The tragedy was that the broadsword team fought against artillery fire, with flesh and blood flying everywhere. However, due to the lack of supplies and inadequate equipment, the wounded died tragically. The biggest shortcomings were the lack of unified command and waiting for the enemy to attack, allowing the enemy to take advantage of the situation and break through with one blow. It is hoped that all sectors of the public will provide spiritual encouragement and material assistance to the front line, and urge the government to strictly order all armies to attack together. Otherwise, the fall of Pingjin is imminent, Hebei will be lost, and the entire North China will not be protected, and we will all become slaves of a conquered nation. The chairman then painfully explained the advantages and disadvantages of the Hebei Association in Shanghai seeking unity. Registration is unity, and saving the homeland and saving the country depends entirely on this action. We must register and unite our fellow villagers, actively provide material assistance to the front line, and unite with various groups to telegraph the government to seek a unified strategy to deal with foreign aggression. This is a spiritual call. Then, the method of registration was discussed. Yang Jitian, Zhang Ziyong, and Mou Ziming all spoke successively. As a result of the discussion, registration and solicitation will be carried out separately. After contacting the fundraising agencies to assist the anti-Japanese armies, they will immediately proceed, donating and remitting funds as they go. Due to the rain, no photos could be taken. The meeting ended at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>Shen Huilian, Wang Xiaoying, and Wei Qiongying, representatives of the China Women's Relief Association for Compatriots in the Northeast Comfort Delegation, carried 42 boxes of comfort goods to the front line in the Northeast to comfort the troops. They returned to Shanghai a few days ago and will hold a general meeting at 2 p.m. today to report on the process and discuss plans to donate more funds or purchase more comfort goods. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Ms. Wang Xiaoying at Wuben Women's School yesterday to inquire about the situation in the north. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Military Situation: Fervor</p>
<p>Ms. Wang said that when the representatives left the front line, the war was calm, as if in a truce. Only when they boarded the train in Tianjin to return south did they learn from the newspapers that the war had started again and that the various passes of the Great Wall were in danger. The situation must have changed. The representatives brought a total of 42 boxes of comfort goods, including towels, cigarettes, dry food, and goggles. After arriving in Peiping, they contacted the military authorities and went to the front line of each pass to comfort the troops. The soldiers everywhere were very motivated, especially the lower-ranking officers, who were like madmen all day long. Their sincere patriotism was inspiring. The situation at Xifengkou was better than at other passes, and the morale of the defending soldiers was even higher. However, the lack of weapons and equipment and the hasty construction of defensive works were truly disheartening. Moreover, because the terrain inside the pass was flat, the occupied positions were also less favorable. It was difficult to win against an enemy army with sophisticated weapons and a large number of soldiers. However, the soldiers' eagerness to kill the enemy was commendable. Therefore, even if we lose troops and cede territory, the people of the country must continue to provide material assistance. At present, there is sufficient food on the front line. What is lacking is guns, ammunition, and transportation. The Women's Association will hold a general meeting tomorrow (i.e. today) to report on the process and plan to donate funds.</p>
<p>Popular Sentiment: Depression</p>
<p>The reporter then inquired about the popular sentiment and social situation in Peiping and Tianjin. According to Ms. Wang, the Peiping and Tianjin areas were safe, and the city was the same as before. The business in Peiping and Tianjin may even be more prosperous than before. The peace and tranquility of the popular sentiment was beyond expectation. The two places were less than a few hundred miles away from the passes of the Great Wall. Outside this distance of a few hours, the national war was so fierce, and the people there could still live and work in peace, without panic or tension. This situation was truly surprising. However, since Yu Xuezhong took office in Tianjin, the Japanese army's malicious provocations have gradually subsided. The Japanese concession is open all night and the area is also quiet.</p>

<p>Telegraph Inquiry on Relief Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations' United Association for Relief of Northeast Refugees previously received a telegram from Feng Yangshan in Peiping stating that the relief work was very busy, funds were urgently needed, the funds deposited in the Bank of China had been withdrawn, and requesting another 50,000 yuan for shelter and relief. The association had received very little donations and had limited savings, but there were refugees fleeing everywhere between Qinhuangdao and Changli, and relief could not be delayed. It had first allocated 10,000 yuan to meet urgent needs, and still hoped that all parties would provide assistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association, concerned about the large number of refugees in Qinhuangdao and Changli reported in the newspapers, sent a telegram to Qu Wenliu yesterday to inquire about the relief situation. The original telegram read: "Mr. Qu Wenliu of Beiping, greetings. We have recently heard reports that refugees are fleeing everywhere between Qinhuangdao and Changli, and the tragic situation is a hundred times worse than the bombing by enemy aircraft. We are deeply saddened by this. What is the exact number of refugees and what is the specific tragic situation? What are your plans for the relief of refugees fleeing westward from the front? We look forward to your telegram with great anticipation. Feng Yangshan is in charge of this matter. Xu Shiying, Wang Xi, Huang Qinglan, Qian Yingqing, Huang Bodu, and others of the Shanghai Charity Organizations' United Association for Relief of Northeast Refugees."</p>

<p>Wang Delin's wife and the family members of his subordinates are now living in two locations in the French Concession, on Route Paul Beau and Daxingfang. Their monthly expenses are borne by six charitable organizations, with each organization responsible for approximately 150 yuan, with the hope that they will increase the amount as much as possible. This will be done temporarily for six months. It is now known that the Northeast Refugee Relief Association of the Republic of China has completed its work and cannot provide monthly support. Therefore, the association donated 1,000 yuan in one lump sum yesterday to do its part in providing relief.</p>

<p>Responding to Impeachment</p>
<p>According to a newspaper report, Gao Youtang, a supervisory committee member in Nanjing, impeached Wang Zhengting, the former foreign minister, for losing the party's rights in various parts of Nanyang and for betraying the country. Wang issued a statement yesterday, saying that this was an old matter from two years ago. It should be known that the establishment of party branches was not allowed in various parts of Nanyang. When he was the foreign minister, he exchanged letters with the British ambassador, Lampson, to discuss solutions. This letter was approved by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee and was not his sole decision. Moreover, the matters discussed in this letter were never effective and were never implemented. He does not know what is meant by betraying the country.</p>

<p>Company Suddenly Fires Fifteen Workers</p>
<p>Trade Union Petitions Party and Government for Speedy Mediation</p>
<p>The labor unrest at the Nanyang Tobacco Company on East Broadway Road, after the mediation by party and government agencies and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, had temporarily ended, and the situation had been eased. However, the company suddenly posted an announcement a few days ago (the 17th) announcing the dismissal of Wu Shiyuan, Zhang Zhang, Li Gui, Li Xinfa, and 11 other former trade union officials, causing the labor unrest to become serious again. The Nanyang Office immediately reported to the Fourth District Cigarette Trade Union to request negotiations. The union, upon receiving the report, was deeply concerned about the expansion of the unrest. Therefore, in addition to notifying the workers to work with peace of mind and wait for a resolution, it specifically submitted a petition to the party and government agencies yesterday, requesting speedy mediation.</p>

<p>Zhuang Songfu and Others Request No Change of Route</p>
<p>Since the January 28 Incident last year, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been extremely crowded due to the dangerous environment. At that time, fortunately, the Daxing Shipping Company, in view of the suffering of the refugees from Ningbo and Shaoxing, who were exposed to wind and rain, sent the Hongxing steamer to add voyages on a daily basis, which benefited merchants and travelers. This was no small feat. After the incident, the steamer continued to seek reforms, reducing liquor fees, and relieving the burden on the general poor merchants and travelers, and was praised by the people of Ningbo and Shaoxing. It is now reported that Mr. Xu of the Hongxing Shipping Company has accepted the movement of other Shanghai-Ningbo shipping companies and intends to change the route of the steamer. People from Shanghai and Ningbo heard the news and felt indignant. The village elder, Mr. Zhuang Songfu, and others, considering that if the steamer stops sailing, it will have a significant impact on the poor merchants and travelers in Ningbo and Shaoxing, sent a letter to Mr. Xu, urging him to uphold his long-cherished aspiration to care for his fellow villagers, adhere to his original intention, and never be restrained by money or oppressed by force, and fight to the end to benefit the hundreds of thousands of poor fellow villagers in Shanghai. It is not yet known how Mr. Xu will respond after receiving the letter.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Errors in Silver Needle Testing for Poison in "The Washing Away of Wrongs" <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Forensic Institute's Investigation Deems It Impractical</p>
<p>Our country's examination of poisoning, according to "The Washing Away of Wrongs," involves inserting a silver needle into the corpse's mouth and anus, sealing it with paper, and removing it after a long time. It is said that if there is poisoning, the silver needle will turn dark black, and wiping it with soapberry water will not remove the discoloration. If there is no poisoning, the color will be bright white, and so on. Now, after investigation and experimentation by the Forensic Institute of the Ministry of Justice in Zhenru, it has been found that this method is absolutely impractical and has many errors. A request has been submitted to the Ministry of Justice, asking to instruct all levels of courts to comply. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the various articles on examining poisoning recorded in "The Washing Away of Wrongs," the method of inserting a silver needle into the corpse to determine whether it changes color to determine poisoning or not is impractical and has many errors. It is proposed to instruct compliance. The results of the experiments and opinions are listed below for your review.</p>
<p>The case of a criminal case is of utmost importance, and the examination of poison is especially important to be accurate and clear. Not only must the cause of death of the deceased be understood, but also the severity of the charges against the defendant, whether it concerns life or death. As for whether the poisoning is due to suicide, homicide, or accidental harm, and what kind of poison was taken, and what its ingredients are, it is also necessary to conduct a detailed examination, conduct a chemical test, or conduct a dissection experiment and an animal experiment to obtain accurate results and avoid wrongful convictions.</p>
<p>The specialized books in our country for examining corpses and injuries have always been compiled based on "The Washing Away of Wrongs." Legal officials regard "The Washing Away of Wrongs" and the "Collected Evidence Records" as the highest standards and guidelines. According to "The Washing Away of Wrongs," it started during the Chunxi era of the Song Dynasty when the judicial officer Song Ci collected and recorded the "Collection of Doubtful Cases" written by Jin He and Lu Gong Ning and his son, Prince Zhongyuan, and the "Inner Forgiveness Record" by an anonymous person in the Song Dynasty, and compiled them together. Among them, the various methods of examining injuries and poisons are divided into categories and seem to be described in detail without omission. However, in reality, there are many shortcomings. It has been followed to this day for more than 700 years. Unfortunately, the people of our country only know how to adhere to the old ways and stick to conventions. They lack scientific instruments to assist in the examination. Therefore, although many years have passed, there is no progress to speak of.</p>
<p>In modern times, science has reached a high level of development, and the methods of examining poisons are very complete. The types of poisons have increased, and the symptoms vary. If we continue to adhere to the old theories of "The Washing Away of Wrongs," and use soapberry water to wipe a silver hairpin, insert it into the mouth and anus of the dead person, seal it with paper and take it out after a long time, and say that the silver hairpin turns dark black, and wiping it again with soapberry water does not remove the color, and if it does not, its color is bright white, this is a major mistake. In fact, the result is not a sign of poisoning but a sign of corpse decomposition. According to the facts verified by this office, it can be proven that this method is very unreliable. When a person dies and the corpse decomposes, the stomach and intestines will especially decompose first. The corpse tissue and the contents of the intestines contain proteins that produce hydrogen sulfide due to decomposition. Hydrogen sulfide can cause a chemical reaction with silver. If a silver hairpin is used for testing, it will definitely turn black. If it is mistaken for poison, the error will be very serious. As for corpses, either because the stomach and intestines are empty, or because the degree of protein decomposition has passed, or because its effect is not very strong, the amount of hydrogen sulfide gas produced is very small. Often, the silver hairpin does not change color, or even if it changes color, it fades when washed. "The Washing Away of Wrongs" calls this "foul air," but in reality, it is due to the fact that there is too little sulfide combined with silver. As for arsenic, aluminum, salt, and various poisons, they cannot directly react with silver, that is, they cannot make the silver hairpin turn black. And feces and all decaying organic matter rich in protein, when heated and touched with silver, will turn black. This kind of fact has been verified by experimentation. Therefore, this experimental report is submitted to the public to dispel public doubts and eliminate wrongful imprisonment.</p>
<p>As for future cases of suspected poisoning in various places, it is hoped that the following five points will be followed to conduct examinations and investigations to clarify the situation:</p>
<p>(1) Investigate witnesses (the person themselves or others) to describe in detail the symptoms that occurred after the poisoning.</p>
<p>(2) Collect vomit, blood, stool, urine after poisoning, and even items stained with excretion stains.</p>
<p>(3) Collect suspected poisons, medicines, drinks, and food.</p>
<p>(4) Examine the symptoms of the poisoned patient or the deceased (preferably by a doctor).</p>
<p>(5) If the above items 1, 2, and 3 cannot be completely investigated and collected, then a corpse dissection should be performed to take the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lungs, stomach, intestines, and the contents of the stomach and intestines for chemical testing.</p>
<p>However, the materials collected for inspection in items 2, 3, 4, and 5 should be sent to a place with complete chemical equipment for chemical testing. General doctors do not have the knowledge of chemists, and hospitals do not have complete microscopic chemical qualitative and quantitative equipment, so it is not appropriate to be responsible for poison testing to avoid mistakes. Now that this office has been established for more than half a year, all books and instruments have been roughly set up. The poison testing facilities can be said to be sufficient. We can use the latest chemistry, toxicology, pathology, forensic chemistry, pharmacology chemistry, poison chemistry, electricity theory, and pharmaceutical equipment, as well as microscopes, spectrometers, ultraviolet analyzers, and other instruments, or animal experiments to help, no matter what kind of poison, we can carefully examine its nature, composition, toxicity, and harmful effects, and investigate its cause and effect. Therefore, in the future, if there are cases of suspected poisoning in various provinces, you can send the vomit, stool, urine of the poisoned person, or clothes and items stained with diarrhea, suspected poisons, drinks and food, or even the coffin, to this office for chemical testing according to the law. If the road is far away and transportation is inconvenient, and it is difficult to transport the coffin, you may wish to ask a doctor (local or nearby) to dissect the corpse nearby, take the internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, put them in bottles and seal them, and protect them with wooden boxes outside, and mail them to this office. You can also conduct chemical testing to clarify the situation and issue an appraisal letter for the basis of the judgment. However, the various articles on poison examination in "The Washing Away of Wrongs," the method of inserting a silver hairpin into the corpse is not a toxic reaction, it is extremely inapplicable, and it has been passed down in error, leaving a great impact. Now that the truth has been clarified, it should not be kept silent any longer, so that this false evidence of poisoning is still applied, and we sit idly by and watch the injustice. This is a great loss of the dignity of the law and goes against the correctness of public fairness. It is proposed that your department instruct all provinces and courts at all levels to comply with this instruction. The facts that the silver hairpin poison examination method in the "Washing Away of Wrongs" is impractical are written in the opinion letter and attached to this document for your review and instruction. It is indeed for the public good.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Trial Begins for Kidnapping of Child <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Letter Demands 20,000 Yuan Ransom</p>
<p>Case Solved During Negotiation at Chinese-Foreign Hotel</p>
<p>A six-year-old boy, Atang, son of Jiang Desheng, a native of Shaoxing who resides at No. 45, Jianye Lane, Fulvli Road, in the French Concession and works at a branch office of the Shanghai Telephone Company on Bi Zhu Road, disappeared suddenly at 3:00 PM on February 13th while playing in the lane. Initially, it was thought that he had been abducted by bandits, and the French Concession police were notified to investigate. Later, Jiang received eight letters delivered by the post office, demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan before the child would be released. It was then discovered that the child had been kidnapped. He repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate with the kidnappers, but without success. On the 16th of last month, detective Jin Jiulin of the Special Bureau of the French Concession Police learned that the kidnappers had arranged to negotiate the ransom at 9:00 PM that night in Room 21 of the Huayang Hotel on Guangxi Road in the Public Concession. He immediately led detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Yaoting, Zhou Bingcheng, Cui Zhendong, Cai Jinzhang, Qin Youyu, Zhang Chunsheng, and Xia Wanxing to the hotel at the appointed time. He successively apprehended the kidnappers Zhou Liansheng, Zhang Hualang, Fei Zhaojun, and Wang Desheng at Guangdong Road and Robert Road. He also rescued the hostage at No. 30, Wufuli, Tokyo Road, and apprehended the female kidnapper Qian Aizhen and Zhang Hexiang. (The male and female kidnappers were all natives of Shaoxing and from the same hometown as the victim). They were handed over to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution and interrogation. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The police investigation has been completed, and yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian ascended to the Criminal Court No. 1 to continue the trial of the defendants. First, Fei Xizhen, the lawyer for the police, described the police investigation in detail, stating that the police investigation has now revealed that the case was initiated by the fugitive Zhu Amao and the female bandit Zhang Guixian, the mother of the sixth defendant, Zhang Hexiang. With the consent of the third defendant, Fei Zhaojun, Zhang Guixian and Zhang Hexiang abducted the child to the Yadong Hotel on Guangdong Road at 3:00 PM on February 13th. Fei then escorted the child with Zhang Guixian and Zhang Hexiang to Qian Aizhen's house, the fifth defendant, at No. 30, Wufuli, Tokyo Road, for hiding, and left Zhang Hexiang there to guard the child. Later, Fei, on Zhu's orders, went to the corner of Baoding Road and Tangshan Road in Hongkou at 4:00 PM on March 14th to negotiate with the victim. The day before, Fei invited Zhou Liansheng and Zhang Hualang to participate in the negotiation. Because the ransom demanded was too high, there was no result. On the 16th, Fei and Zhou and Zhang made a second unsuccessful negotiation in front of the Yipinxing in Xizang Road. The victim's representative agreed to negotiate again at 9:00 PM that evening in the Huayang Hotel on Guangxi Road. At the appointed time, Fei accompanied Zhou and Zhang to the entrance of the hotel and left, allowing Zhou and Zhang to enter the door and talk with the victim's representative. The defendants were apprehended when the detectives learned of the situation and rushed to the scene. The police are now prosecuting the first, second, and third defendants under Article 372 of the Criminal Law for kidnapping and demanding ransom. The fourth defendant, Wang Desheng, confessed to having an affair with the fifth defendant, Qian Aizhen, but denied participating in the kidnapping. Therefore, the police are prosecuting the fifth defendant, Qian Aizhen, under Article 316 of the Criminal Law for illegal detention. Although the sixth defendant, Zhang Hexiang, is indeed guilty of the crime, she is still young and was instigated by her mother. The police are temporarily not prosecuting her and are requesting that the court make a ruling or send her to a charitable institution for education, etc.</p>
<p>Then, the victim Jiang Desheng testified that he suspected that his child had been abducted after he disappeared. He reported it to the police that night and requested an investigation. After receiving the letter, he knew that he had been kidnapped and immediately sent his neighbor Wei Bohua as a representative to negotiate with the bandits. He really had no money, so he agreed to pay 300 yuan to redeem the child, but the bandits wanted at least 1,500 yuan, so the negotiations were unsuccessful. The case was solved by the detectives, and the sixth defendant, Zhang Hexiang, and her mother had previously rented a house from our family, so they were familiar with each other, etc. The judge then ordered the defendants to be taken down and interrogated separately one by one. The defendants all admitted to the kidnapping and demanding ransom without denial. The interrogation was completed after noon, and the court ordered the case to be rescheduled for the 28th of this month to designate the person who needs money for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Shi Hangshi carried out three chops with a kitchen knife to Liu Yinsheng</p>
<p>At around 2:00 AM yesterday, Zhao Xinzhou, a police officer stationed at the Tanzhawan Sub-bureau of the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau, received a complaint from plaintiff Liu Laoda and his son Liu Yinsheng, claiming that Shi Hangshi's husband, Shi Hangshi, had used a kitchen knife to chop him on the head. Seeing Yinsheng covered in blood, the officer immediately went to investigate, but the assailant had already fled. He then took the assailant's wife, Hangshi, and Yinsheng's wife, Zhongshi, to the police station. After interrogation by Officer Lou, Liu Laoda stated that he was 48 years old, from Yixing, and lived at No. 113, Lane 7, next to the Dafeng Yarn Factory in Tanzhawan, making a living by farming. Tonight (i.e., yesterday morning), he and his son went to Hangshi's house to call his daughter-in-law, Zhongshi, home. After Yinsheng saw Zhongshi, they started arguing. Shi Hangshi gathered more than a dozen people to brutally beat his son. Shi Zhusan dared to wield a kitchen knife and chopped Yinsheng three times on the back of his head. Therefore, he brought Shi Hangshi to the bureau, but Shi Zhusan had already fled, etc. Liu Yinsheng stated that he was 25 years old and made a living by rowing a boat. His statement was similar to his father's, and he also stated that Shi Zhusan not only committed adultery with his wife, but when they were beating him, he said to Zhongshi, "You can beat me to death." Hangshi said, "I'll beat you to death," and Hangshi handed the kitchen knife to her husband, Shi Zhusan, who chopped him three times. Shi Hangshi stated that she was 38 years old and worked in a yarn factory. Liu Zhongshi was lodging and eating in her house. Today, her father-in-law and husband came to call her back. They had already walked out the door when she heard that something was wrong and then heard the sound of a knife. Yinsheng then shouted for help. She told her husband to chase after them, but they were brought to the bureau by the father and son. Liu Zhongshi stated that she was 20 years old. Today, her father and son came to call her, but she was already asleep. She told them that if they wanted her to go back to the countryside, they should pay off the money she owed here on her behalf. They said, "Where did your wages go?" Before she could finish speaking, they scolded her, ran outside, and took a kitchen knife and chopped herself several times on the head. The official verified the statements. As the case concerned injury, it should be sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation along with the evidence after the documents are prepared.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Autopsy of Suicide Young Woman <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Married Previously, Unhappily Divorced</p>
<p>Nervous Breakdown,厌世Suicide</p>
<p>Remains Coffined by Her Girlfriend</p>
<p>Chen Sufen, a modern young woman from Guangdong, went to the Hua'an Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road alone on the 13th of this month and rented Room 412. She was beautifully dressed, behaved luxuriously, and had a wide circle of friends. Therefore, male and female friends visited her every day. In the evening, the woman would often go out to banquets and not return until midnight. On the 16th, at midnight, the woman drove back to her residence from outside, and there was nothing unusual. But to her surprise, at 2:00 AM the next morning, after a male friend entered the room to visit her, he suddenly discovered that the woman had taken poison. The hotel staff immediately called a doctor for treatment, but the poison had entered her organs and could not be saved. She died at Baolong Hospital at 10:00 AM on the 17th. The hospital then notified the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detectives to take the body to the Philen Road autopsy center to await a coroner's examination. An investigation was conducted. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that detectives Zhang Yutian and Lu Gendi, who are handling the case, have learned from various investigations that the deceased, Chen Sufen, was 39 years old. She had been married in the past and had a daughter named Xiangling, who is now ten years old. However, because she did not get along well with her husband, she has divorced. Her father is still in her hometown in eastern Guangdong. The woman is young, although she has had setbacks in love, she is not willing to be submissive. She socialized everywhere and had many male friends. Among her belongings was a diary, which stated that a man named Rui Jin was one of the people she admired the most. Because Rui Jin had recently broken up with her, her words revealed a sense of disappointment. The diary also contained descriptions of her suicide, generally saying that she had a nervous breakdown, felt that life was meaningless, and therefore decided to commit suicide. In addition, there was a letter to her father, also saying that she had been planning suicide for a long time and that she was determined to carry it out this time, so please do not be sad. The detectives also learned that the wife of Yu Zhibo, a Cantonese resident at No. 10, Wanyi Lane, Luban Road, in the French Concession, was a close friend of the deceased. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office, and Prosecutor Guo Wei was appointed to visit the autopsy center for an examination. Yu Zhibo was specially summoned. According to Yu, the deceased often came to his house. Four days before the incident, she even stayed at his house for a day. He did not know anything else. The reporter then followed Prosecutor Guo into the corpse room and saw that the deceased's face was lifelike, only a red mark was found on her jaw. She was extremely beautiful. She was wearing a flannel coat and was barefoot and without shoes. After the examination, Guo said that since the deceased had no relatives in Shanghai, he ordered Yu Zhibo to sign a guarantee to claim the body for coffining. Yu then hired someone to go to the Wanguo Funeral Home to buy clothes and a coffin and immediately placed the body in it.</p>

Zhang's whole family woke up in shock, but it was too late to escape. They were immediately monitored by the thieves and not allowed to make a sound. The thieves rummaged through chests and cabinets and searched arbitrarily. They slapped Zhang and his wife several times and demanded cash, forcing them to hand over the keys. Ms. Wang resisted slightly and was shot by a thief. The bullet entered from the left rib and did not penetrate.

<p>Eighteen Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wang Nengjing, a lewd monk from Xinghua, seduced Liu, a recently widowed woman from his hometown, ten years ago. After committing adultery, he rented a house for them to live together, appearing as husband and wife. Around August of last year, the monk and the woman lived in the kitchen alcove at No. 68 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. At that time, the woman became romantically involved with Fan Weisheng, which aroused great jealousy in the monk. He specially purchased a sharp beef ear knife and, taking advantage of Wang's deep sleep one dark night, stabbed her to death. Fearing punishment, he fled. Recently, he secretly returned to Shanghai and resumed living with the woman at No. 9 Yongan Lane, Hengtong Road, Zhabei.

<h3 id="e138">Judgment in Ship Leasing Lawsuit <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>| Tongyu Wins; Yadong to Compensate Various Amounts |</p>
<p>In October of the previous year, Yadong Shipping Company leased the Xin Ping An ship from Tongyu Shipping Company for a term of four months at a monthly rent of eight thousand yuan, with the delivery date set from November 20 to December 10 of the same year. Yadong manager Mo Zhaoyun then entered into a salt transportation contract with Deyi Xiang, using Xin Ping An to transport salt, with the loading date set to begin on December 12 of the same year. If the deadline was exceeded, Yadong would compensate Deyi Xiang four hundred yuan per day. However, Tongyu failed to deliver the ship as scheduled, and Yadong negotiated with them, but it was difficult to resolve. Subsequently, Yadong hired a lawyer to sue Tongyu for compensation for losses and outstanding payments, alleging that after entering into a contract with the plaintiff, the defendant Tongyu entered into another ship leasing contract with a third party, sending the Xin Ping An ship to Hong Kong, Shantou, Andong, Hongqi, and other places to transport coal, earning freight of twenty-three thousand four hundred and seventy-five yuan, causing the plaintiff to incur thirty-five thousand yuan in losses due to delayed salt transportation. Also, due to a daily overdue penalty of four hundred yuan, totaling fourteen days, the amount was five thousand six hundred yuan. In addition, not long after the ship was delivered, the Songhu Incident occurred, financial stagnation, so the second installment of rent could not be paid. The defendant used this as a reason to prohibit the ship from loading and unloading goods, from February 1 of last year to April 6, a total of sixty-six days, the ship was stopped in Jiujiang, unable to operate, counting from the date the defendant ordered the ship to stop, also forty-three days, calculated at four hundred yuan per day, a loss of seventeen thousand two hundred yuan. Also, because the defendant's Yuanda ship ran aground in Huangzhou, without obtaining the plaintiff's consent, the salt loaded on the Xin Ping An was unloaded, and the ship was sent to Huangzhou to tow the Yuanda, costing nine days. The plaintiff suffered a loss of seven thousand two hundred yuan. According to the lease, the ship should have expired on April 24 of last year, but the defendant arrived in Shanghai on April 19 and took it back without waiting for the expiration date, causing the plaintiff to suffer another two thousand yuan in damages. The plaintiff requested that the defendant be ordered to compensate for the above four items of loss in full and to declare provisional execution. The defendant then hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to defend the case and filed a counterclaim against Yadong. The reasons for the defense were to refute each of the plaintiff's claims, stating that the various losses claimed by the plaintiff were completely unfounded and that the defendant could not admit them. As for the facts of the counterclaim, it stated that the rent payable by the plaintiff Yadong Company to Tongyu and the price of coal purchased on its behalf totaled thirty-three thousand two hundred and fifty-four yuan, five jiao, and three fen. After receiving it, deducting the fifteen thousand six hundred and forty-three yuan, six jiao, owed to the defendant, the plaintiff requested that the Yadong Company be ordered to repay the amount in full and pay interest. After repeated hearings by Li Hu, the civil division chief of the First Special District Local Court, summoning both parties for interrogation, the court recognized that the plaintiff Yadong Shipping Company's claims were completely unreasonable and rejected its suit. The defendant Tongyu Shipping Company's counterclaim against Yadong, with ample evidence, was upheld by special judgment, ordering Yadong to repay Tongyu one thousand, five thousand, six hundred, forty-three yuan, and six jiao, as well as interest at an annual rate of 5% from December 20 of last year until the date of execution. The costs of both the main suit and the counterclaim shall be borne by the plaintiff.</p>

<p>| Court Issues Decision Not to Prosecute |</p>
<p>On March 20 of this year, a case of a son and daughter-in-law plotting to murder an elderly father occurred in Shijia Lane, Nanshi. The deceased, an elderly man named Chen Qiaonian, was murdered, with a hemp rope tied around his neck and a knife wound on the back of his head. After investigation by the police, he was rescued and survived. It was then reported that he had been murdered by his eldest son, Chen Kaihong, daughter-in-law Chen Yang, and second son, Chen Xiaogou. The police station dispatched officers to arrest Chen Kaihong and others and send them to the local court for interrogation, trial, and detention pending investigation. Details have been previously reported. It has now been learned that the case was investigated by Prosecutor Zheng Qinming, and the results showed that the defendants had absolutely no murderous intent. A decision was made not to prosecute, and Chen Kaihong, Chen Xiaogou, Chen Yang, and others who were detained were released on bail some days ago. The facts and reasons for the decision not to prosecute are summarized as follows: Chen Kaihong and Chen Xiaogou are the sons of Chen Qiaonian, and Chen Yang is Chen Kaihong's wife. On February 24 of this year, Qiaonian wanted to go to Nanjing, and Kaihong and Xiaogou jointly gave him eight yuan for travel expenses. Qiaonian used up all the money and did not go. That night, he secretly stayed on a boat by the river. The next day, he wandered around Puxi. At 9:00 PM, he passed by Shijia Lane in Nanshi and was tied up with a rope. The case was submitted by the Public Security Bureau. After investigation and interrogation, it was found that the defendants were all working in Pudong that day, and Chen Yang was at home breastfeeding. There was no act of murder. This shocking case of filial impiety has thus come to a close.</p>

<p>Xiangsheng New Cars Arrive in Shanghai. Since the Huashang Xiangsheng Automobile Company undertook the special pick-up and drop-off service for passengers at the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Station, the original vehicles were insufficient for distribution. Fifty new cars were purchased from the United States some time ago, and have now arrived in batches to join the service. However, the colors of the new cars are quite inconsistent. It is heard that they will be changed to green one after another in order to achieve uniformity. In the future, calling a car will be faster than before. It is heard that the company has a telephone receiver hanger that it distributes to all sectors. Anyone who wants to install it only needs to inform the company by letter or call 40800 and 40000, and a craftsman will be sent to install it immediately, free of charge.</p>

<p>A Collection of Letters Discussing the Question of "Can We Return to the Countryside?"</p>
<p>(12) Letter from Mr. Yu Yuesheng of this city! Where shall we go?</p>
<p>On April 5th, in the Shanghai News Reader's Consultant column, there was Mr. You Huai’s response to Mr. Xiongsheng's discussion "Can We Return to the Countryside?". After reading it, I felt very disappointed. Mr. You's reply was not only irrelevant, but also extremely dangerous. First, it inverted the facts, and second, it made the problem unrealistic, turning it into a utopia, desperately escaping reality. He said, "I (Mr. You) feel that in times of national crisis, seeing the drunken and dreamlike life in the city, it is better to find a quiet and lovely countryside to find another way out, relying on my ability, and spend ten years to build a new kind of Arcadia in my mind." This fully shows that Mr. You does not understand the current society, especially the "countryside", otherwise he would not have said such things. We will not talk about the theory for the time being, just talk about the facts. Thousands of farmers are leaving their homes and constantly moving to the cities. Is this because they don't "love the countryside"? Do they not love their "farmer friends (relatives) in the countryside"? Or is it because they "are not determined to work hard and seek a life in the countryside"? (This is Mr. You's "prerequisite for going to the countryside") No, no, it's entirely because they can't live in the countryside, live a normal life! Why can't they live in the countryside? This is a problem of the current society, just like we can't live in the city. Then, the question of "Can we return to the countryside?" is very clear. Since neither the countryside nor the city has a way for us to live, where shall we go? Suicide? Sit and wait for death? Of course, we are unwilling. Then, is there still a way to go? Yes, it is to actively fight for our survival. Fighting for survival cannot be achieved by empty talk, nor can it be achieved by "relying on my (personal) ability" (personal strength is very weak in the current society, it can only be achieved by the common struggle of the majority of people who cannot survive but want to survive! The main thing is to solve the contradictions under the current social system, so that we can survive. Not only in the countryside, but also in the city, there is a way for us to live.</p>
<p>(13) Letter from Mr. Wei Hao of this city! Discussing the rural issues with Mr. You Huai Gao</p>
<p>After reading Mr. You's letter, I realized that Mr. You is originally a dreamer. The prerequisites he said for going to the countryside, (1) Do you love the countryside, there are some questions about this. Mr. Xiongsheng was originally from the countryside, and he had to go to the city for a living. Now, because of unemployment, he plans to return to the countryside. The fact tells us that under the current system, the only hope is a stable life, not a matter of love or not. As long as there is a place to live, whether it is a city or a countryside, (2) Do you sincerely love your farmer friends in the countryside, regarding this point, I don't know whether Mr. Xiongsheng sincerely loves them or not. However, Mr. Xiongsheng has already expressed, "There is nothing in the city that makes me nostalgic." Of course, he can only jump out of this city and go to the countryside. Farmers have no complaints, and naturally there is no reason not to love them, but sincerely loving farmer friends cannot solve the problem of life, so what? As for the advantages of the countryside, (1) and (2) are acceptable, and (3) being more free in life, this is Mr. You's dream. In fact, is it better than in the city? The authority of local tyrants and evil gentry can make farmers suffer and dare not speak out at any time. On the level of suffering in the countryside, it is true that sufficient enjoyment cannot be obtained in terms of material things, but how can a penniless person living in the city enjoy material things? Moreover, Mr. Xiongsheng is unemployed, and his life is still a problem, so there is no talk of enjoyment. Mr. You also said that people who have lived in the city for a long time may feel bored and boring. This is not for Mr. Xiongsheng, but for two wealthy people to think deeply. Mr. You thinks that "in this time of national crisis, it is better to find a quiet and lovely countryside to find another way out, and spend ten years to build a new kind of Arcadia in my mind." Mr. You is simply not solving the difficulties for Mr. Xiongsheng, but writing an ideal article for himself. May I ask, in the current situation of rural bankruptcy, how can a penniless Mr. Xiongsheng build a "new Arcadia"? Mr. You is really too smart, thinking that now that the country is in trouble, the only way is to escape to the countryside to build Arcadia. Then the suffering compatriots in the four northeastern provinces should all have a way out, and they will not be slaughtered by Japanese imperialism, right? Mr. You said, "The city lacks food and materials, which can be supplied by the countryside." That's right, the production in the countryside is enough to supply the needs of the city, but since capitalism has poisoned the countryside in China, not only the city lacks, there is no need to rely on the countryside, but the current countryside is also being messed up by capitalism. Talking about Mr. You's first step in teaching Mr. Xiongsheng, the content seems to be not bad, but with Mr. Xiongsheng's poverty, it is really not easy to raise one or two hundred yuan. Moreover, in the years of economic bankruptcy in rural China, the primary problem for farmers! Life, is still not solved, making their children receive education, as far as I know, it is simply impossible, and the tuition and difficulty in reading make it even more difficult. If Mr. Xiongsheng is a rich man, such a losing business may be okay to play with as a pastime. Mr. You's second step is also not bad, but if the first step doesn't work, then the second step, under the current chaotic situation of natural disasters, man-made disasters, and harsh taxes, will not have any results. Mr. You's third step is to practice medicine and sell medicine. Regarding this point, the doctor registration statistics of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau can show that it is not a successful thing. In the past two years, there has been a surplus of doctors in Shanghai, but the reason is that too many people from the inland have come to Shanghai to make a living. Then, what certainty does Mr. Xiongsheng, who is an outsider to medicine, have to go to the countryside? Mr. You's fantasy is unrealistic, which eventually leads to the ideal of the fourth step of "carrying out village governance work". I think the first three are simply impossible, and the fourth one has no basis, but Mr. You is enthusiastic about advocating rural education to save the country. I don't know what the content is. I hope Mr. You can give us a chance to read a long article. Finally, according to my personal opinion, Mr. Xiongsheng is unemployed in the city and returning to the countryside, it is the same. There is no way. Correction In the last letter of Mr. Liu on April 17, the word "two" in the thirteenth line from the end "to embark on these two roads" is a mistake for the word "one". This is specially corrected.</p>

The abstracts of the important cases resolved are as follows: 1. The new curriculum standards will be implemented in primary and secondary schools, and whether the admission test questions and curriculum of public and private senior and junior high schools can be closely linked with the new curriculum standards is a major issue.

<h3 id="e161">The French Concession Authorities Forced the Closure of Schools Yesterday <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Nangshang Bowen Club classes as usual</p>
<p>Morning Glow and other schools are still in negotiations</p>
<p>丨The Municipal Education Bureau Submits a Report to the Municipal Government for Instructions丨</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Bowen Girls' Middle School, Morning Glow Girls' Middle School, and Nanyang Commercial High School in the French Concession have recently been ordered to close down immediately by the French Concession Public Works Bureau because they are deemed to have insufficient facilities. The school authorities have all registered with the Municipal Education Bureau, and this move is obviously undermining the integrity of our educational administrative power. Therefore, they have submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau to negotiate. The reporter inquired with the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday and learned that the Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan expressed his indignation at the French Concession authorities' interference in our educational administrative power beyond their authority and has reported the details to the municipal government for instructions. It is also learned that the French Concession authorities have also withdrawn the order after explanations from various parties.</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) Regarding the French Concession authorities' forcing the closure of Morning Glow Girls' Middle School and other schools in the concession, the Shanghai News Agency reporter learned about the situation from various parties yesterday, which is slightly different from what was reported yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Nanyang High School of Commerce Nanyang Commercial High School, which was moved to Shanzhong Road in the French Concession after the January 28th Shanghai War, said yesterday that the school secretary Mao Zhaorong said that the school had been registered with the Municipal Education Bureau. The school building was destroyed after the Shanghai War and moved here. Although it is temporary in nature, the school building is spacious and the facilities are adequate, and there is nothing wrong with it. Now that no closure order has been received from the French Concession authorities, nor have they seen anyone sent to the school to prevent classes. The school has never had a suspension of classes. Now that it is reported in the newspaper, I am afraid there is a misunderstanding. The health license for February has already been issued. The school's Dean of Academic Affairs, Dr. Wu Jiang Leng, personally visited Director Lai of the Health Department today. Lai said that there was no such thing and asked the French Public Works Bureau and said that it was all rumors.</p>
<p>Bowen Girls' Middle School Furthermore, Ms. Huang Zhaolan, the principal of Bowen Girls' Middle School, told reporters that the school was established seventeen years ago and was the first batch of schools registered with the Municipal Education Bureau in the seventeenth year. It was also filed with the Ministry of Education. How the school has been managed since then is well known to the community. The report that the French Concession authorities forced the school to close down is not true. The students of the school are still attending classes as usual and are at peace with each other. Today, a special envoy from the French Public Works Bureau came to the school to explain and requested a correction. It is said that there was a misunderstanding. However, one side of the lead-sheet school sign at the entrance of the school was suddenly stolen last night, which is very strange. Morning Glow Girls' Middle School The reporter went to Morning Glow Girls' Middle School to meet Principal Xue of the school. According to him, a detective suddenly came to the school on the 11th of this month and verbally notified them to stop classes. The school felt that the matter was strange and went to the French Public Works Bureau to inquire the next day. The Director General of the Bureau said that the school was unsanitary and should be improved, but he did not explain why it was unsanitary. He requested that the Bureau send someone to investigate. On the 13th, the Director General of the Health Department came to the school, took a look at it occasionally, and said that the playground must be paved with yellow sand and the ceiling must be painted. The school immediately complied with the instructions and completed it completely. However, there has been no reply approving the resumption of classes.</p>
<p>Other Schools Other schools such as Wenguang Primary School, Yihua Primary School, Xingzhong Primary School, Xinlai Primary School, Yixin Primary School, Jintong Primary School and other six schools were all stopped from attending classes by one or two detectives, and no official order was issued.</p>
<h3 id="e162">University League Issues a Letter to Allied Nations of the World Regarding the Sino-Japanese Problem <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Far East Problem is the Biggest Cause of World Disputes</p>
<p>The Washington Conference Should Unanimously Sanction Japan's Atrocities</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Student Union, because the Washington Conference is about to open, and the Sino-Japanese problem will also be discussed at the conference, specially decided to issue a letter to the Allied Nations of the World at the last inaugural meeting, stating the opinions of Shanghai students on the recent international situation and the Sino-Japanese problem. The declaration has been drafted and is now being translated into English, German, French, and Japanese to be broadcast to all countries in the world. The following is an excerpt of the original Chinese manuscript:</p>
<p>In order to realize its East Asia Doctrine and deepen the colonization of China, Japanese imperialism has spared no effort to abandon international trust, commit great unrighteousness, violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and implement armed occupation of our three northeastern provinces to create the "Manchukuo Puppet State", which triggered the Shanghai War. Recently, it has become more and more greedy, ignoring the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly, implementing withdrawal from the League, and sending troops to occupy Jehol. Moreover, it still cannot satisfy its greed, and continues to expand its military operations against us, gradually attempting to occupy North China and sweep through Tianjin. Our government and people have always taken the protection of peace and the upholding of the dignity of international treaties as their duty. Therefore, after the disaster occurred, we immediately requested arbitration from the League of Nations. Although the report of the League of Nations Investigation Team suggested a plan to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, China stood in the position of being invaded and was not willing to recognize it. However, for the sake of world peace and Eastern peace, our government is still willing to compromise and has accepted it in principle. The report of the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations, which is based on the Lytton Report, was also passed at the League of Nations General Assembly because of China's sincerity in maintaining peace. Now that the League of Nations' proposal to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute based on Article 15 of the Covenant has failed because Japan refused to accept it and withdrew from the League, then the responsibility for destroying peace should be borne solely by Japan, which has added another layer of evidence. From the beginning, the countries involved in the Sino-Japanese dispute were China and Japan, and the League of Nations was in the position of mediation and arbitration. Now, the object of the dispute has replaced China's position with the League of Nations. If the League of Nations can still fulfill its responsibility to maintain international "justice" and "peace", then the countries participating in the League of Nations, especially the major countries that preside over the League of Nations, should immediately invoke Article 16 of the Covenant to impose sanctions on Japan. This is a matter of course. However, after the report of the Special Committee was passed, the League of Nations has taken no other action except to start the organization of the Twenty-Nation Committee and invite the United States and Russia to participate in the joint study of solutions to the Liaoning case. Even when discussing the prohibition of exporting munitions to belligerent countries, our representative Gu Weijun proposed that the principle of prohibiting the export of munitions should be stipulated for aggressor countries and invaded countries, but the conference ignored it. Then, after the report of the Special Committee was established, Japan brazenly ignored everything and continued its military oppression against us, swept through Jehol, and threatened Tianjin. There is a reason for this. However, just as Japan's military oppression against us is deepening, it happens to be the time when international disputes in Europe are expanding. The German-French situation, the Four-Power Agreement, and the disarmament issue have made the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany too busy to deal with their own problems, and they have no energy to consider the Eastern problem. The debt dispute is also a stumbling block to European and American cooperation. If this problem can be temporarily resolved, then the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and other countries will unite in the Far East to sanction Japan, which is also impossible in fact. To solve the Eastern dispute, we must first seek cooperation between Europe and the United States, and to seek cooperation between Europe and the United States, we must first solve the internal disputes in Europe. From the current international situation, we also admit this point and are painstakingly trying to mediate the matter. Now, the Washington Conference is about to open in Washington, and the Far East problem will also be listed as one of the discussion topics. China and Japan have also accepted the invitation to participate. However, we would like to represent all Shanghai students here to contribute to our allied friends that the Far East problem is the biggest factor in world disputes, and the brutal policies of the Japanese warlord government are the biggest source of international peace. If this is not sanctioned, then the international crisis will never be eliminated. Today's countries are all part of the entire international community. The shattering of one ring will affect the whole situation. The Far East problem and the German problem are the two major centers of international problems after the European War. If this is not resolved, international peace will never be established. Now that the Washington Conference has gathered the leaders of the world's major countries in one place, its power to guarantee peace and sanction Japan is greater than the League of Nations Conference. Moreover, the disputes among the countries themselves will be dispelled at this Washington Conference, so it is even more possible to unanimously sanction Japan's policy of aggression. The dawn of world peace will depend on this Washington Conference, and the success or failure of the conference will depend on the resolution of the Far East problem. The times are difficult and the responsibility is heavy. May our allied governments and people take this into consideration. School. The detectives rushed into the classroom on their own and announced to the students that foreigners were on holiday for Qingming Festival today, so the students left the school one after another. In short, the procedure for the French authorities to deal with the school's closure this time is quite ridiculous and laughable.</p>
<p>Request for Negotiations The Municipal Education Bureau has only received written reports from Morning Glow Yihua and other four schools regarding the French Concession authorities' closure of private schools. Since the remaining schools have not submitted reports, the situation is not very clear. The facts of each school that has already reported have been forwarded to the municipal government for review. The Root Cause of This Matter According to the results of the reporter's inquiries from various parties, the root cause of the French Concession authorities' resolute action this time is actually due to the organization of the French Concession Private School Federation, which requested subsidies for private schools in the concession, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the French Concession authorities. As a result, an investigation of the schools was conducted, which led to today's incident.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance race, initiated by the Baihong Athletic Team, departed from Shanghai on the 14th and arrived in front of the English statue on the shores of West Lake in Hangzhou at 12:53:11 PM yesterday. The first place winner was Huang Shengbai, with a total time of 21 hours, 21 minutes, and 27 seconds for the four-day journey. Second place went to Li Yagu, and third to Zhou Ruquan. A total of six people arrived within the specified time. Seventeen people started, and seven dropped out along the way. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e169">From Hai'ning to Hangzhou <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Hangzhou) The Baihong team's Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance race, after lodging in Haining on the evening of the 17th, showed spirited faces at dawn on the 18th. The previous night, the sky was full of stars, but unexpectedly, heavy rain came in the middle of the night and continued until the 8:30 AM departure. There were thirteen participants starting out, but six had already dropped out. About 11 kilometers from Haining, Huang Shengbai and Zhou Ruquan took the lead, with Li Yagu and Bao Yibi trailing by over 400 meters. The remaining runners were spaced about 3-4 meters apart. The last place was shared by Wu Shuying and Zhu Shengyuan, who both withdrew before reaching Wengjiabu. At Wengjiabu, Zhou Ruquan and Huang Shengbai were neck and neck, with Li Yagu trailing by about 800 meters, as was Chai Huanjin. Bao Yibi was about the same distance behind Chai. As a result of the intense competition, Huang Shengbai took first place, and Li Yagu took second. Li made a final sprint to the finish line, astonishing onlookers. From Qintai Gate to the Chen Yingshi statue on the shores of West Lake, fifty members of the Zhejiang Provincial Boy Scouts Fifth Regiment (orphanage) were stationed at various posts, wearing bamboo hats, holding Baihong flags, and showing great spirit, undeterred by the wind and rain, comparable to the racers. The Hangzhou Postal Workers' Union presented a large silver shield, which we heard was internally designated to be awarded to Chai Huanjin. The principal of Hangzhou Senior High School visited the hotel and gifted several cakes as a gesture of慰勞.</p>
<p>Details of the Intense Competition Along the Way</p>
<p>Three Quit Before Reaching Minhang - After arriving at Minhang, they crossed the river one after another. Chen Xuzhou was the first to reach Nanqiao, took a brief refreshment break, and then continued forward, reaching his destination at 1:49:05 PM, taking only 5 hours, 19 minutes, and 5 seconds, including the river crossing and refreshment break. Following him were Huang Shengbai, Li Yagu, Jin Zhongkang, and Zhou Ruquan. About a mile from Longhua, Kuang Shihuai withdrew onto the ambulance because he had injured his foot during practice, and his old injury recurred, leaving him no choice but to give up. Zhu Shengyuan and Meng Guangyi, due to hunger, went to find food and missed the time, taking a car to Caojing. However, the staff waiting in Minhang were greatly inconvenienced, waiting until 5:00 PM without seeing them arrive.</p>
<p>Xie and He Stop After Crossing Zhapu - After arriving at Caojing, they went to the hotel. Fortunately, the local Public Security Bureau sent people to prepare, and although the place was crude, there was nothing else they could do. They got up at dawn, had breakfast, and set off at 7:40 AM. The weather was terrible, with a slight breeze blowing incessantly, and drizzling rain falling non-stop. When they reached the Jin Siniang Bridge, the rain suddenly intensified and became torrential, and they were all soaked to the bone. Upon reaching Zhapu, the weather cleared up, and the racers became like furnaces, using their own body heat to dry their clothes. Chen Xuzhou was again the first to arrive. Before crossing Zhapu, Xie Guolue withdrew, and after crossing Zhapu, He Dafu did the same. At 1:41:10 PM, people from Haiyan met Chen Xuzhou on the seashore, and the county Party headquarters, farmers' association, women's association, chamber of commerce, district office, and other seven groups prepared refreshments and presented brocade flags, which was quite a scene.</p>
<p>Chen Xuzhou Switches to Riding a Bicycle - It was originally planned to go to Haining on the 16th, but there was heavy rain all night on the 15th, and the sea breeze added to the ferocity, which did not stop until 8:00 AM the next morning. The referees, out of consideration for the racers and to prevent them from getting sick, ordered a halt, but with the condition that they had to continue the next day no matter the weather. At 8:00 AM sharp on the 17th, they departed from Haiyan in a light breeze and drizzle. Lin Quanbo reluctantly withdrew due to food issues. Chen Xuzhou and Xu Yanbo stopped halfway. Zhou Ruquan was the first to arrive at Jiaoliyan, where the teachers and students of the local elementary school came to visit and took a group photo with Zhou Ruquan upon his arrival. After passing Jiaoliyan, Chen Xuzhou suddenly got off the ambulance and switched to riding a bicycle, leading Zhou and Huang all the way to Haining, and leaving Huang Shengbai more than 3,000 meters behind. It is strange that he can ride a bicycle but refuses to run.</p>

<p>Wins Peckar 1000 Points to 811</p>
<p>Li Gongying vs. Xu Shizhang Today</p>
<p>The Portuguese Medina has now entered the quarter-final week. Medina's victory over Peckar yesterday was also hard-won. It was by no means an easy victory. During the first twenty-five shots, the situation fluctuated up and down between the two sides, forming an equal situation. At that time, Peckar was ahead, once leading with 275 to 230. Medina then scored three huge shots, 37, 24, and 80, and took the lead in the first half with 500 to 376. In the second half, Peckar showed his calm and excellent technique, gradually progressing over long distances. After several shots of 40, 30, 33, 22, and 27, the difference was only eight points (654 to 662). At a critical moment, Peckar could have pocketed a ball, but he touched the corner, and so Medina, who was about to lose the game, bravely advanced. In a time of crisis, heroes arise, and huge scores such as 25, 52, 37, 50, 27, 20, and 20 appeared one after another, extending the distance to more than 200 points, and the victory was sealed. The final result was 1000 points to 811. Today at 5:30 PM and 9:15 PM, our country's billiards king Li Gongying will face the new star Xu Shizhang. Xu's skills seem to be improving, and he is brave enough to make progress. At that time, there will be a contest on the green table.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Talking About Human Relationships <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>Last night at the Xinya Restaurant, I was drinking with my classmate Jun Shaoyou, whom I hadn't seen for three years. In his drunkenness, I heard him say some sorrowful words about the state of the world and human relationships. He said, "Ah, when I was in school, I was very young, and I felt hopeful about everything. Brightness and happiness were like two bright lights shining in front of me. At the same time, my family was well-off, and many relatives and friends were very affectionate. But since my family went through many changes two years ago, and both my parents passed away one after another, all my property has been scattered and exhausted in several changes. As a result, those relatives and friends have become distant. When people asked for my help, I tried my best to provide it to them, feeling that people should help each other. At that time, people would flatter and fawn over me. Now that I need people's help, they seem to have made an agreement to quietly distance themselves from me. I am still the same person I was before, but people treat me completely differently. Now I understand that their flattery and fawning at that time were not for me as a person, but merely in the hope of achieving their material assistance. Now that the hope of material assistance is gone, they no longer flatter and fawn. I have now gained a new experience and lesson: Human beings are __________, they are only a combination of interests."</p>
<p>After listening to his words, I felt that in this materialistic era, human warmth and the coldness of the world are exposed everywhere. This has already become a common phenomenon. The words "there is no mutual assistance among human beings, only a combination of interests" were particularly poignant and accurate. Wherever there are interests, people will cling to the powerful and engage in deceitful scheming, and even family members will clash and break apart, not to mention relatives and friends. Is this also a transformation of the world and people's hearts!</p>
<h3 id="e174">Doing One Thing, Complaining About It <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>"Doing one thing, complaining about it." The old man worked as a barber and foot masseuse his whole life, always hoping that his son would at least be a bricklayer or carpenter. But the son did indeed learn to be a bricklayer or carpenter, and always hoped that in the next life he wouldn't do the same old thing, that rowing a sampan or pulling a rickshaw would be much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Su Dongpo, the inventor of the Four Joy Meatballs, had these two lines in his bathing-the-baby poem: "I only hope that my son will be foolish and dull, and that he will become a high official without disaster or difficulty." Even a big shot like Su Dongpo complained so much about being an official that he hoped his son would be foolish and dull, not showing the "doing one thing, complaining about it" face like his father. The so-called "becoming a high official without disaster or difficulty" is just saying the same old thing, just talking. Think about it, even the wise and intelligent Su Dongpo had thirty-six disasters and seventy-two difficulties. If he were foolish and dull, how could he ever hope to become a high official? So a great literary figure said, "Not like his father, not like his mother, but like the old shoemaker next door." These are the words in Su Dongpo's heart, but he couldn't write them down, so he deliberately set up a puzzle for later generations to ponder. "However," "not so," to bring the conversation back around. There are many exceptions.</p>
<p>For example, the old man is the "True Son of Heaven." Although this Son of Heaven has reached the point of "wiping away tears to leave the palace" and "hanging himself on Coal Hill," he still hopes that his son will work hard to revive the dynasty, revitalize the old business, and ascend the dragon throne again. So our little brother Puyi, though he became the last emperor of the Qing dynasty, was still desperately trying to be a puppet emperor. And those who are thieves will not "do one thing, complain about it." When a robber is taken to the execution ground, after having his fill of wine and meat, he still shouts, "Twenty years from now, I'll be a good man again." It is known that being a robber is just as enjoyable as being an emperor.</p>
<p>"Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes, thieves raise sons to dig holes in walls." "Passing down the mantle," "inheriting the family business," only emperors and thieves do that. Other than that, whether learning martial arts to sell one's strength or learning literature to sell one's pen, "not being able to eat enough, starving to death," one can't help but "do one thing, complain about it."</p>
<h3 id="e175">□□ Abandoned <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>Since the loss of Yuguan, the fall of Rehe, and the simultaneous abandonment of various passes along the Great Wall, the military authorities, to preserve military secrets, have replaced place names with □□. The war news has increased quite a bit □□. A humorist said: □□, the shape is like a square frame, should be read as "kuang" (frame). Now the situation in eastern Luan is critical, □□　　, and it will be abandoned, so it becomes □□ abandoned, □□ abandoned, □□ abandoned. Reading the sound, it is like the sound of cymbals, which is more alarming than the Yuyang war drum. But the gentlemen and ladies in the south, hearing it, do not listen, and dance and sing wildly, with many being like sparrows in a hall, unaware of the impending disaster. Alas! (But reward)</p>
<h3 id="e176">Modern <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yian</p>
<p>I am not opposed to "modern" (摩登), because "modern" is just a transliteration of the English word "modern." It is a word that existed hundreds of years ago, and its original meaning is "contemporary" or "recent." If used as a noun, it means "a modern person" or "a person with modern ideas." Since we were born as modern people, we are already modern in fact, so why debate it? Some people are intimidated by these two characters, whose meaning cannot be derived from their literal components, and become fascinated by them. Thus, the word "modern" has almost independently acquired a separate meaning in China. In their view, "modern" is not only "new-fashioned," but also contains a certain amount of mystery and romance, and seems to be more closely related to women. As soon as the word "modern" is mentioned, the image that appears in their minds is a woman with short, permed hair, wearing red lipstick, having shaved off her eyebrows and redrawn them with artificial strokes, sticking out her chest, wearing narrow-sleeved, long gowns, and wearing high-heeled leather shoes with silk stockings underneath. And such women also believe that this is what it means to be modern, at most adding some decorative skills, such as dancing and speaking a few common English phrases. I believe that everything modern, from politics to toilet paper 丨 as long as it is a domestic product 丨 should be modern. It is even more natural for women to be modern. A truly modern woman should at least know how to be a housewife who is beneficial to her family, a mother who is beneficial to her children, and a person who is beneficial to society. All of these require the most modern methods. If one only cares about decoration and social activities, then one is truly not worthy of discussing the Way of Modernity.</p>
<p>Since the word "modern" has become popular, there have been speculators in the market who have used this name to speculate, no different from using "curvaceous beauty," "model," and "sensuality" to make profits in the past. I feel quite uneasy about this, so I'm saying a few words.</p>
<h3 id="e177">A Red Sandalwood Tree in Pingwang Town <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>"Red beans grow in the south, In spring, how many branches will sprout? I advise you to pick them in plenty, For they will rouse fond love." This short poem by a Tang poet has elevated the value of red beans. The Red Sandalwood Villa of Qian Muzhai in Changshu is especially well-known. There is one in my southern Jiangsu Zen temple, said to have been planted by the Song Dynasty White Pigeon Zen Master, and it is now withered. Behind the Jijian Temple in Tianchi Mountain, Baima Ravine, there is a very large red sandalwood tree, which bears fruit once every few years. The monks of the temple collect the abundant red beans and give them to benefactors to seek incense money. Those devout Buddhist old women often inlay them into hairpins and insert them into their hair, saying that they can ward off evil spirits. There is also one inside the Renxing Pawnshop of Wu Yachang, Fengmen, which is from before the Hong-Yang Rebellion. The pawnshop was originally set up by the Xu family of Wuzhen. The site was originally owned by my relative Peng. During the turmoil of the Hong-Yang Rebellion, Peng Boyun gave the house to others due to lack of funds. This red sandalwood tree has a trunk that one cannot embrace, and its slanting branches extend out of the wall, covering the eaves of the neighbor's house, so when it bears fruit, it often falls down due to the wind, and the neighbor gets an unexpected harvest.</p>
<p>In the dowry of a Jing person, there is a red bean, a product of Tianchi Mountain. When He'er was born, it was inlaid into an ornament and tied around her wrist. Unexpectedly, He'er gnawed it off when her milk teeth first sprouted. I wrote an article at the time called "A Very Regrettable Red Bean," which was published in a certain newspaper. My friend Gu Jundao saw it and generously sent me by mail one of the two red beans produced in the South Pacific Islands that he had collected. That red bean was bright in color and had a precious luster. I treasured it carefully, regarding it as a precious jade.</p>
<p>Zhao Junzhenchu came from Pingwang and saw my red bean. He mentioned the Yuanlai Native Produce Store in Pingwang Town, which has an iron tree in the courtyard. The iron tree is the common name for the red sandalwood tree. Although the tree has luxuriant branches and leaves, it has never borne fruit. Until last autumn, it suddenly bore abundant fruit, harvesting about a few liters. This spring, it was still being distributed to relatives and friends. It is said that the grains are very large and the color is also very lovely.</p>

<p>There was also money owed to the oil and salt store, the firewood shop, the thread shop. Ordinarily, they didn't take credit; it was a great favor if they extended credit. Now, they felt obliged to pay them back. From early morning, she slowly dealt with the creditors, but by three or four in the afternoon, as it was getting dark, there were still two debts unpaid. One was to the water carrier, less than a dollar, and the other was to the sesame seed cake shop, including sesame cakes eaten and flour borrowed, totaling two dollars. How could she not pay them? The water carrier had come three times that afternoon, which was tolerable. But the most troublesome was the young apprentice from the sesame cake shop, who came countless times. Finally, he stood in the courtyard and said, "Our boss says, are you going to pay or not? If you don't pay, I'll wait here and not go back." Guizhi, being young, still cared about appearances, so she said to Jiang: "It's only two or three dollars, why let this kid shout in the courtyard? Let's take two pieces of clothing to pawn for a few dollars and get rid of these two creditors." Jiang said, "We're wearing all the cotton clothes. The unlined and lined clothes aren't worth much." Guizhi said, "Then I'll take off this cheongsam. I can wear a short jacket. You can wear that thin cotton coat. That tattered leather jacket can also be pawned. We can sleep on the heated kang, and mother and daughter can share one quilt. The mattress can also be taken. Altogether, we should get more than two taels of silver." Jiang thought for a moment and nodded, "That's the only way." So Guizhi, without hesitation, changed her clothes. She pulled the mattress out from under the quilt, rolled up the two pieces of clothing into a large bundle, tucked it under her arm, walked into the courtyard, pointed at the young apprentice and said, "You wait here. It's only two or three dollars, do you have to force people to death?" Saying this, she went to the pawnshop in a huff. In this small town of Haidian, there was indeed a pawnshop. During this time of year, the business was as prosperous as any other store. Guizhi walked into the shop and pushed the bundle onto the counter. The clerk, seeing the items, knew she was a distressed customer because the clothes were still warm. (46)</p>

<p>Gold Price Slips Slightly by $3.40</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Soars Then Plummets at Opening</p>
<p>Rumors of US Gold Deregulation Cause Rebound</p>
<p>The gold market reopened yesterday after the holiday. Although prices initially fell, they gradually rebounded after the opening. By the close, the price decrease compared to before the holiday was minimal. In the morning, due to the large increase in the London market to 375 during the closure and a one-cent rise in New York silver prices, Anglo-American exchange rates rose by 3/125, US-British by 4/5625, and private telegrams by 8125, causing a sharp drop at the opening. The foreign exchange market opened firm but not by much. Banks were eager to settle, likely due to indications of US gold deregulation, with large amounts of cash being shipped to France and Holland, and reports of Treasury Secretary Woodin opposing the purchase of silver and the increased printing of banknotes. The domestic market was very tight, stabilizing the gold market. HSBC's listed prices showed British exchange unchanged, while US exchange only rose by 25. Prices continued to rise afterward, making the opening price of $1064 the lowest price of the day. After a period of calm, prices rose to $1080, but later retreated due to news of an economic conference scheduled to open on the 24th, along with rumors of bimetallism. However, prices soon rebounded. The day's trading was stable, with the refining premium rising by $18-19 and swap rates for April-June at a discount of $9.50, and May-June ranging from $4 to $8. The day's market conditions are detailed below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at $1064, with goods opening at $4.50. The foreign exchange market opened with British exchange at 1 shilling 2 pence 625, firmer by 125 compared to the previous close, and US exchange at 21, firmer by 3125 compared to the previous close. Sentiment was very stable. Yuan Mao Yong Da De Cheng were the first to offer bars, reaching $6 and higher. Pan Gen bought up US dollars for August at 21.50. Heng Yu, Fei Fa, and Yong Jin rose to $7 and above. Banks showed strong buying interest, stabilizing the gold price. Zhi Feng and Yong Yuan Chun rose to $8 and above. Although there was a slight retreat, due to the difficulty in settling US dollars for the current month at 21, Heng Yu and Chun Yuan Yong rose further to $9 and above. Fu Chang and Da De Cheng added again, breaking through $70 to .05. Zhi Feng and Yong Nai Lai sold, retreating to $68.30. Yuan Chun added again, rising to $70.

Yuan Kang Xiang offered bars, gradually rising to $70.05. Mitsui sold US dollars for the current month at 875, and Heng Xing offered bars in the market. Wah Bi also sold US dollars for June at 125, retreating to $67.50. HSBC's listed prices were also announced, with shillings unchanged and US dollars up by 25. Buyers flocked in.

Zhejiang offered US dollars for July at 1875, then dropped to .05. Bing Xing came to buy, and it rebounded again. Yuan Mao Yong and Da De Cheng rose further to $3 and above. Da Tong wanted US dollars for June at 21. Yuan Sheng and Yong Heng Yu competed to buy, reaching $4.50, because US dollars for the current month at 21.75 were still difficult to settle. McCarly then offered US dollars for May at 75, and Xie Xing and Yong Fu Shun sold slightly, gradually declining. Wah Bi offered US dollars for July at .0625, reaching $2.50. It then rose sharply, showing a very firm trend. Zhi Feng Yong rose to $5 and above. US dollars for June at 21.9375 were not available for sale. Qian Chang Xiang added again, reaching $76.50. By this time, it was near closing. Small investors sold, dropping to $4.80, but the noon close was still at $1076.40. After the close, goods were offered, slightly rising to $7 and above, so goods were sold at $7.50.</p>
<p>The after-market opened higher at $1079.30, then retreated from $9.50 to $8.50 because goods opened at $8.50. Shun Li offered bars, reaching $9.80. Zhong Nan offered US dollars for July at 21.

Rui Xing also followed the trend to sell. Zhi Feng Yong also sold, dropping to $4.30. Heng Xing offered to cover, and the downward trend was quelled from there, gradually pulling up to close at $1076.70. After the close, it was slightly higher, rising to $7 and above, and goods were sold at $7. The day's highest foreign exchange price was $1080, and the lowest was $1064, with a fluctuation of $16. The result was a decrease of $3.40 compared to before the holiday (a swap difference of $6).</p>
<p>For public bonds (April), 336 were released by Ying Feng Heng, 140 by Da Feng Heng, 14 by Hui Yuan, and 7 by Yong Feng. Those received included 301 by Tong Feng Heng, 84 by Run Chang Yong, 56 by Da De Cheng, 49 by Run Chang Yu, and 7 by Zhi Feng Yong, totaling 497 released and received.</p>
<p>The refining premium was slightly higher, initially opening with a premium of $18-19, sold by the silver shop. Tong Feng Heng advanced slightly. Afterward, the premium rose to $29, with Ying Feng Heng buying slightly in the market. Trading was fragmented, and transactions did not reach 100 taels.</p>
<p>For swaps (May-June), Heng Xing initially offered to Hui Xiang $28.7.50, Rui Kang offered to Hui Xiang 42, and Run Chang Yu offered 98 at the same price. For cash positions, Ying Feng Heng and Da Feng Heng offered to Qian Chang Xiang a premium rising to $8. Afterward, bulls aggressively offered swaps, gradually declining.

Qian Chang Xiang also aggressively offered to buy, and there was a temporary shortage of shorts, dropping to $4.67, but there was no transaction. It gradually improved afterward, with the noon close around $6 (April swapping June). Rui Kang offered to Qian Chang Xiang $9.50, only 7 (goods with a higher premium, an estimated 420 goods were offered with a $8 premium at 51 and 77, 14 goods were offered with a 9.50 premium at 115 and 141). In the afternoon market, Yuan Sheng Yong offered to Hui Xiang 14 at $7, and Heng Yu 35 at $7.20. Tian Feng Yong sought this but could not obtain it. Qian Chang Xiang offered to Da De Cheng, Qing Fa Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Hui Xiang, etc., more than 3,000, at $4. This was not a market transaction (160 goods offered 42 goods at $6.50, and 7 goods offered 7 goods at $6.70 at 7 and 9). 3,262 April tickets remained, and 11,109 May tickets.</p>
<p>Due to the HSBC exchange rate listing the US exchange up by 25, the listed price was 20.50, and the gold price was $1170. Based on the closing price, it was approximately $94, less than $5 compared to before the closure. The booked price for the current month was $1088, for May $1082, and for June $1076.

Later, HSBC's listed prices were announced, with British exchange unchanged and US exchange up by only 25, causing further tension.

<p>Amendment to Agricultural Relief Act Fails</p>
<p>Washington, April 17th: The Senate today abandoned the proposal to fix silver coinage at a ratio of 16:1 to gold, after hearing that President Roosevelt did not support it. Democratic leader Senator Robinson informed the Senate that the President was undecided on opposing the Silver and Inflation Bill. Senator Wheeler revived the Coinage Bill to aid the Agricultural Relief Act, but Senator Robinson again announced that President Roosevelt hoped that the amendment concerning inflation in the Agricultural Relief Act would fail. The silver amendment to the Agricultural Relief Act ultimately failed by a vote of 43 to 33.</p>

<p>Silver Dollar Receipts and Payments are Frequent: Guangdong Copper Coins Rise Gradually</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day banks reopened. Foreign banks on the Bund had to process all the receipts and payments that had accumulated during the four-day closure, making it an exceptionally busy day. The surplus or deficiency in funds was not easily calculated, leading to a sharp increase in the water head price. It initially reached 1.2-1.3 cents, then 1.8-1.9 cents, and even 2 cents, before slightly falling back to 1.4-1.5 cents at the close. The price of silver dollars also increased accordingly. The morning and afternoon markets were both at 6 cents. The morning trading volume for short-term bills was over 5.4 million, and the afternoon volume was over 900,000. The trading volume in the Small General Association was over 400,000. Banks' receipts and payments for foreign banks totaled 8.67 million for silver and 9.56 million for silver dollars.

<h3 id="e184">A Glimpse of the Bleak Cocoon Market <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>According to financial circles yesterday, in previous years, around this time in late spring, new cocoons from various regions would be successively released onto the market, and the demand for silver dollars in Shanghai would be frequent. However, this year, the opposite is true. The demand for slight special-purpose silver dollars is not strong, and there are virtually no cocoon payments being loaded out. The reasons for this are: First, the weather is too cold, and the development of silkworm moths is incomplete. Natural sericulture is also inferior, not to mention the cocoons of farmers and merchants. Second, the silk market was poor last year, and general traders are reluctant to take risks for meager profits. Third, silver money houses are cautious in lending, especially strict for cocoon lending. At this time of uneven financial adjustment, who would be willing to spend huge sums to purchase cocoons? Therefore, observing from various perspectives, the cocoon market is not only inferior, but may also have to be abandoned invisibly, and no one is willing to do it.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Securities <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Public Bond Prices Plummet Alarmingly</p>
<p>Unfavorable War Situation Causes Bulls to Dump, Retail Investors to Sell</p>
<p>Market Sentiment is Very Weak, All Bonds Decline by Around One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market at the Chinese Securities Exchange experienced an intensified decline, with the situation quite unfavorable. The reason for this is that the war situation is unfavorable, people are in a state of panic, and many bulls are unloading. Retail investors are also selling aggressively. However, Cantonese shorts are gradually covering. Financial circles do not have large sales. Market sentiment is extremely weak, and it is temporarily difficult to be optimistic. In the morning opening, the decline started slowly but then gained momentum, dropping by about half a yuan. The layoff and troop reduction bond was still doing well, but the 19 Customs bond's decline did not abate, falling another 5-6 cents. Trading also gradually increased. In the morning, most sales were from the 49, 54, and 11 series. The 38 series bulls continued to unload, and the trend was extremely weak. In the afternoon opening, the layoff bond experienced a larger decline. Retail investors rushed to sell, and the market price fell again, with some falling by over 7 cents. Later, the Consolidated Tax bond, due to Cantonese covering, stabilized. Distant-term salt tax bonds recovered slightly due to this reversal. At the close, short coverings on the trading floor slightly rebounded by 3-4 cents. However, there were also sales of the 21 series, so there was not much improvement in the Consolidated Salt Tax bond. As a result, market prices continued to fall by several cents to around one yuan. However, the May layoff bond alone fell by the most, 1.25 yuan. After the close, sentiment remained depressed. However, the transaction volume for May has reached over 20 million. The squeeze in the future is bound to be considerable. The total transaction volume was 12,878,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in cash, with consolidated salt tax futures accounting for over 4.8 million, troop reduction over 2 million, 19 Customs debt bond over 2.48 million, and 20 customs bond and 20-roll share bond accounting for over 2.5 million. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to 400,000-500,000. Total futures amounted to 12,875,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e186">New York Stock Market Slightly Weak <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the Xin Feng Foreign Firm, on Monday (the 17th), the New York stock market initially opened weakly due to speculators anticipating that AT&amp;T would reduce its dividend. Later, US Steel Corporation Chairman Taylor announced that the company's workload had reached 21 percent, the highest peak since March 1932. Also, because grain prices remained firm, the market rebounded. The total volume of shares traded for the day was 1.01 million. Looking at the current situation, the market may continue to rise, especially in areas such as agricultural implements and department stores, which are related to the Agricultural Relief Act, the trend of which is especially bullish. The Dow Jones Indices are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 61.59 Down 1.29</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 25.70 Down 0.90</p>

<p>Standard Yarn Slightly Stabilized</p>
<p>After a Continuous Decline, Short Covering Slightly Aroused</p>
<p>The yarn market trend has slightly stabilized. After a continuous decline for four days, it aroused profit-taking coverage. Regarding the factory side, a unified resolution on April 21 to unanimously reduce production, new sellers have temporarily reduced their selling, so the market conditions are not as weak as the previous day. But generally speaking, the fierce competition to sell inferior yarn continues, and the future outlook remains bleak.</p>
<p>Human Mark Market Trend Still Weak</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the human mark market, the market was still weak due to the decline in US cotton prices. Prices for each month fell by 4-5 cents. Later, due to Xincheng's large-scale short covering, the market rebounded by 7-8 cents. Prices fell again at the third close, resulting in a fall of 3-4 cents for each month. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand was good, and the market sentiment was calm. The near-term rose by 3-5 cents, and the far-term was flat. The total volume of transactions for the day was 43,900 bales. The breakdown of sales was: Chun Ji sold 1,200 bales, Geng Feng 1,950 bales, Shen Ji 1,250 bales, Ren Feng 1,400 bales, Tong He 1,100 bales, and Yi Yu 1,650 bales.

<h3 id="e188">American Cotton Falls, Local Cotton Buyers Greatly Disappointed <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market situation remains sluggish. The public expected a large increase in American cotton prices after the opening, but unexpectedly, it fell by twenty points. As a result, buyers were greatly disappointed, and the market turned to downstream trends. However, most bulls remain strong in their intentions. According to news from a cotton industry organization, the price of cotton in Tianjin has risen by one to two yuan per dan, while the price of Shandong cotton has fallen by one yuan per dan. These two pieces of news contradict each other. Overall, the situation for foreign cotton remains bleak.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Continues to Decline</p>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Biao market today, people generally expected American cotton prices to rise based on yesterday's forecast. However, incoming telegrams reported a decline, causing widespread anxiety. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and prices fell by two to ten points across all months. The situation remained sluggish in the afternoon, but prices strengthened slightly at the close, with prices falling by five to ten points across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 81,900 dan. According to reports, Da Chang sold 5,600 dan, Yi Yu 1,600 dan, Chang Feng 1,400 dan, Yi Feng 2,400 dan, Shen Ji 2,200 dan, Ren Feng 1,500 dan, Heng Yi 1,900 dan, and Tong Ji 1,900 dan. Yuan Xing Chang bought 4,700 dan, Yu Kang 3,200 dan, Yi Chang 2,000 dan, Xin Cheng 2,200 dan, and Tong Xing 1,700 dan. Closing prices are as follows: Zheng Biao Closing Price Fluctuations and Account Balances: July 4265, down 35, 113,600; April 4155, down 25, 53,900; August 4300, 40, 101,200; May 4185, 30, 84,000; Total 456,400; June 4235, 35, 103,600.</p>
<p>Cotton Mills are Even More Quiet</p>
<p>The cotton business is unusually quiet at present. All factories are unwilling to operate because the price of American cotton has suddenly fallen again, and the yarn market is heavily burdened and difficult to recover. Transactions of raw cotton are even scarcer. Sources include 50 bales of Yao cotton and Shaanxi cotton at 43.00 yuan. Da Feng Factory imported 253 pieces. Spot goods were delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e189">American Cotton Reverses, Falling Over Ten Points <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton reversed and sold off due to profit-taking by bulls. Selling pressure caused the market to decline. Futures prices fell by 17 to 21 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. British and Indian cotton markets were closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 17th): American Cotton Compared to Previous Day, Equivalent in National Currency: May 658, down 19, 42.20; July 675, 19, 43.30; October 694, 21, 44.70; December 711, 17, 45.60; January 717, 19, 46.00; March 731, 18, 46.80; Spot 670, 15, 43.00.</p>

<p>He Xia Rice Sales Stagnant with Small Price Declines</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply was 150 lots, and transactions were scarce due to rain. Fortunately, the Shantou gang bought over 1,000 bags, and the Yantai gang moved 500-600 shi. The market situation was slightly sluggish, with the price of rice from the Su Tong gang and Qingjiao from the South Port falling slightly. Du Yangjian rice sales were average. The exchange rate for silver dollars remained stable, with no market for paper dollars. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 7-8 boats arrived from He Xia. Sales of white japonica rice were normal due to the rain, and the market trend was expected to be stable, with mid-grade rice slightly tight. Thin japonica rice was stable, and early rice was tight with a small price increase. Du Yangjian rice sales were active, and the market trend was expected to be high, with mid-grade rice also showing tightness. Du Bu and Ke Jian rice were fair and stable, and the exchange rate for silver dollars was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Flour and Wheat Both Appear Flat and Sluggish <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market this morning and afternoon, prices for all months generally appeared flat and sluggish. Quotations for foreign wheat fell slightly by 0.10 yuan, and some brokers were unwinding their positions, so selling pressure was relatively strong. It was also rumored that Argentine foreign wheat traders were offering wheat at a price equivalent to 3.224 yuan. If a deal is actually reached, there is little hope for future standards. As a result, this month's price fell slightly by 0.03 yuan, while prices for May and June remained unchanged, July fell slightly by 0.01 yuan, August fell slightly by 0.02 yuan, and September fell slightly by 0.01 yuan. After the opening of the flour market this morning and afternoon, prices for all months showed a trend of near-term declines and long-term stability. Quotations for foreign wheat fell slightly by about 0.10 yuan. Most people's sentiment has softened. This month's standard, due to gradual recovery in actual sales, showed a sharper decline. Because the situation in North China is becoming increasingly dangerous, flour sales have been hit. For other months, some manufacturers slightly increased their offerings, but dealers from the interior also made a few purchases, so the market atmosphere was relatively stable. Judging from this situation, large factories still want to hold on, but due to the unfavorable environment, it will ultimately be difficult to stand firm. As a result, this month's price fell by 0.0125 yuan compared to the previous day, May's price fell by 0.005 yuan, and prices for June through September remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Soybean Sales Active with Fujian and Guangdong Merchants <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The supply of yellow soybeans is not large, and various merchants are inquiring about them. Although the market trend is turning sluggish, future prospects are feared to be less prosperous. Yesterday, merchants from Fujian and Guangdong bought five or six truckloads of Zhengyangguan soybeans at prices ranging from 5.18 to 5.20 yuan. A manufacturer sold one truckload of Bozhou soybeans at a price of 5.10 yuan. Shops in this street bought two truckloads of Dalian soybeans at a price of 5.75 yuan. Merchants from Xiamen bought 100-200 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans at a price of 5.44 yuan. 60 bags of Pudong Du soybeans were sold at a price of 5.51 yuan to merchants from Guangdong. Merchants from Wenzhou bought 150 bags of Liuhe green soybeans at a price of 5.06 yuan.</p>

<p>Changjiang Merchants Actively Buying Artificial Silk</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of trading in artificial silk after the holiday. Merchants from Changjiang had considerable demand for near- and long-term futures and actively started buying. Due to the sluggish exchange rate, asking prices became increasingly firm. Merchants from Sichuan and Hubei bought 56 boxes of Jin Shuanglu, Shuangxing, Hong Jinzhong, and Yi Shu brands for delivery in April, May, and June at prices ranging from 169.75 to 176.50 yuan, an increase of 0.50 to 0.75 yuan.</p>

<p>Zhigung Woolen Fabric Trends Weak</p>
<p>The market for woolen fabrics has been similar to last week. The trend for original blue Zhigung woolen fabric continues to weaken, with both overt and covert price cuts. Those holding goods are willing to lower prices to accommodate. Yesterday, Deki 1440 Huang Tianbao reduced sales of foreign fabric to 6.45 yuan, 2488 Four Generations of Filial Piety to 5.10 yuan, Anli Five Elders Gathering to 6.85 yuan, Ningfeng single-sided Zhigung to 3.75 yuan, Taihe General to 6.50 yuan, Shuang Fugui to 4.60 yuan, and both Fengyu and Ningfeng Wannian Ronghua sold for 4.94 yuan. There were few wholesale transactions at the guild. Buyers from local merchants are still sluggish. The market decline is due to a large number of unsold goods and a lack of current sales.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Metals <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Hunan Merchants Buy Hunan Lead in Shanghai</p>
<p>(Hunan Green Lead) Hunan's green lead production is sold in Shanghai in large quantities every year. Recently, because the local factory directly signed a contract with a certain company in Shanghai, its goods cannot be sold in Hunan and Hubei provinces. Therefore, local merchants are now buying in Shanghai. Yesterday, a certain firm from Hunan and a certain firm from Hankou bought 600-700 bars at a price of 15.85 yuan per dan. It is heard that three or four other firms are also negotiating deals for over 500 bars. Their prices are currently still under negotiation.</p>
<p>(Garden Lead Wire) Since the military authorities stopped buying, the market has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, merchants from Sichuan and Tianjin suddenly started buying, so transactions were very active. Although prices did not show much progress for the time being, they felt much firmer than before.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Exposing the Bottom <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia Gan</p>
<p>It's good to be thorough in everything, but "exposing the bottom" isn't necessarily brilliant. Because a series of left turns results in encountering friends turning right, at that time, nodding in agreement, your face will feel burning. People who want freedom suddenly want to protect the freedom of restoration, or the freedom to massacre the masses, revealing everything to the bottom, but even the freedom itself is lost, leaving only a bottomless pit.</p>
<p>For example, opposing the eight-legged essay is extremely necessary. The eight-legged essay is originally the product of stupidity. Firstly, the examiners find it troublesome -- most of their brains are made of submerged wood. What kind of representation of sages, what kind of beginning, development, turn, and conclusion, the rhythm of the essay, there are no fixed standards, difficult to grasp. Therefore, it is defined in stocks and shares, considered to conform to the format of official orders. Using this format to "weigh articles", one can see the amount of importance at a glance. Secondly, even the candidates find it very effortless and less troublesome. Such an eight-legged essay, whether old or new, should be swept away. But this is for the sake of being clever, not for being more stupid.</p>
<p>However, there is a strategy to preserve stupid people. They say, "I'm not good, and he's the same as me" -- if everyone can't survive, let's fail together! After "he" fails, the old, stupid "me" always secretly stands up again. The actual benefits belong to the stupid. It's like wanting to overthrow idols. The idols become anxious and point to all the living people saying, "They are all like me". Then you rush to overthrow all the living people who look like idols. When you come back, the idols will give you a reward, saying that overthrowing idols by overthrowing the "overthrowers" is extremely thorough. In fact, at this time, greater stupidity envelops the whole world.</p>
<p>Opening your mouth with poetry, saying "Yu said", this is the old eight-legged essay. And some people consider "Darwin said, Plekhanov said" as the new eight-legged essay. So, to know that the Earth is round, everyone has to travel around the Earth themselves. To manufacture steam engines, one must first sit in front of a boiling kettle to investigate things. This is naturally extremely thorough. In fact, the previous opposition to the literature of defending the Way originally meant that such a man-eating "Way" should not be defended. But some people want to be thorough and say that they don't defend any Way. Isn't this "defending no Way" also a kind of "Way"? Therefore, the truly thorough thing is still the following story:</p>
<p>In ancient times, there was a revolution in a kingdom. The old government fell, and the new one stood up. Others said, "You revolutionaries originally opposed the idea of having a government, how come you yourselves are now running the government?" The revolutionary immediately drew his sword and cut off his own head. However, his body did not fall, but turned into a zombie, standing upright, with his throat seemingly saying haltingly: the realization of this doctrine originally had to wait three thousand years.</p>

<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Putting down the telephone receiver, he couldn't suppress the trembling of the muscles on his face, couldn't hide his ashen complexion. After mumbling a few words to the people in front of him, he walked out of the manager's office of the rice shop. He had originally wanted to instruct a few people in the accounting room, but he swallowed his words. Stepping onto the hired car, he simply waved to the driver, A Er, and didn't feel like saying anything.</p>
<p>"There's a telegram from Shanghai, things are terrible." This sentence kept ringing in his heart. In the mid-spring weather, the sun shone brilliantly on him, but he felt as if someone had splashed cold water all over him, and he felt strangely cold. The echo of the driver pulling the car rang as arrogantly as usual, and he subconsciously stepped on the foot bell. However, everything in front of him seemed to be collapsing in his eyes. He felt that sitting in the hired car wasn't as imposing as it used to be.</p>
<p>He was thinking vaguely, the car seemed to be pulling faster than usual, and it had already stopped at his door. Walking into the living room, Lao Zhou was waiting with an impatient look. "How bad is it?" he asked, his eyes gleaming.</p>
<p>"The margin money and cotton yarn we speculated on have fallen, a total of 340,000. The market has changed too much, we just can't keep up," said one, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Then let's give it another shot, do or die, we can't worry about so much," he felt a sense of revulsion rising in his heart.</p>
<p>"It's no good, given the current situation, we can't turn around anymore. If we do it again, I won't do it. I've seen through it. Big players can make fools of us, and we small capital holders can only somersault in their hands. I understand this change completely."</p>
<p>He was silenced. These words cooled his courage. Splitting the loss with Lao Zhou, each of them lost 170,000. After deducting the 50,000 yuan deposit, they still owed 120,000. Looking at Lao Zhou, Lao Zhou's long face was also tense, and he lowered his head, calculating in his mind. The capital of the rice shop and silk shop was exactly 120,000. The family property left by his ancestors, his management of more than ten years, was all gone in an instant. His arrogance and prestige in this city also vanished in an instant. He also secretly blamed himself in his heart for not engaging in this kind of thing and making himself suffer, but he immediately defended himself, besides this, there was no more enjoyable thing. The city was stretching out its hands to tempt people, how would he know that there were large assets at play?</p>
<p>"Do you know? The backers of those big shots are foreigners. Think about it carefully, it's really sad, everything about the Chinese is held in the hands of foreigners," Lao Zhou broke the silence.</p>
<p>"You're not going to empty your pockets, are you? I'm finished," he shook his head, as if seeing his rice shop and silk shop being taken over by others, and even the echo of the hired car didn't sound as loud as before.</p>
<p>Occasionally a spring breeze blew on his face, and he took a deep breath.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Random Notes from My Hometown <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>One, On the Ship</p>
<p>The few small houses in my home have been locked up for eight years -- I miss my hometown so much -- the orange tree in the courtyard, the camellias and irises planted in front of the courtyard, the dim paper windows, the green moss in the pond in front of the door: often causing a faint longing in my heart. This time during the spring break, my father insisted that I go back with my uncle to sweep the tombs, he said:</p>
<p>"If you don't go back, I'm afraid you won't even recognize your ancestors' graves. Fallen leaves return to their roots, and one day you will always go back."</p>
<p>I then understood that this was hereditary, the homesickness of the race, so I picked up a suitcase, brought a cane, jumped on the ship, together with a light soul.</p>
<p>The ship was terribly crowded that day, with people lying everywhere. So many people! They were all speaking the intimate local language. They cursed people with the most vulgar words. They were all simple, innocent big children. They loved to speak local dialects, loved to boast. So I looked at them and smiled. I was happy because our fellow villagers were accustomed to speaking local dialects, bragging, and cursing people with all sorts of words that no one could imagine. Sometimes their boasting would get to the point where even they themselves couldn't believe it. They would curse to the point where even their own children couldn't help but laugh. They were all lovable people! They grew up in the same soil as me. They were a fish-and-salt-eating people, and I was also a fish-and-salt-eating person.</p>
<p>When the ship set sail, I leaned against the iron railing on the deck, looked at the shadows of the clouds in the river, and dreamed of my hometown. The bow slowly turned sideways, and I heard the river slapping against the hull of the ship, so I said, "Goodbye, Shanghai! Our hometown is the land of fish and salt, our hometown has truly clear blue skies, green waters, white clouds. Our hometown is such a simple and unadorned land! We are going home!" So I thought.</p>
<p>The antennas of the tall buildings stretched out, always stretching out, but slowly the wind flags of the Jianghai Customs disappeared, the clock disappeared, the golden dome of the Sassoon Building disappeared, followed by countless warehouses, getting a little bigger, then a little smaller, smaller. The tall smokestacks of the power plant were as small as a bunch of pencils. When the first sea breeze blew my hair up after leaving the Wusongkou, I gently shouted: "Go, Shanghai!" I was drunk.</p>
<p>At night, the waves were terrible, hitting the bottom of the ship with a bang. I quietly lay in bed and watched the swaying of the silk ribbon of the gauze curtain, unable to fall asleep. How could I fall asleep? When it dawned, I would be in my hometown. At four o'clock in the morning, I quietly got up, lit a cigarette, and secretly ran to the deck. Looking out, it was all boundless blue water. On that endless surface of the water, the light of the lighthouse floated, shining far away, following the waves, disappearing for a while, and then reappearing. I stared blankly at the lighthouse. This was more beautiful than the New Year's red lanterns. Life was so changing, and life was such a monotonous cycle. I don't know how many. In the gray dawn, a black line of land appeared at the horizon. Slowly the black line got closer, clearer, and I could see the trees, fields, and distant shadows of mountains above. Suddenly I jumped up as if mad, struggled for a long time, and then sat back on the canvas chair, sighing: "I'm here! That's my hometown!"</p>
<h3 id="e199">On the Way Home (Continued) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ceng</p>
<p>The two foreigners seemed a little embarrassed. I can very well understand this embarrassment. A year ago, when traveling with my wife in small cities or rural areas in foreign countries, wasn't I often stared at by many people?</p>
<p>Probably because I was the only one wearing Western clothes in the car, the two foreigners seemed to be waiting for me to turn around. As soon as our eyes met, one of the foreigners asked me in English:</p>
<p>"Is Minhang up ahead?"</p>
<p>"Please ask me in Chinese. I can't speak English." During the years in Europe, seeing many British people, no matter what country they were in, as soon as they encountered a yellow person, especially a Chinese person, they would rudely and without regard for the situation, address you directly in English, as if all Chinese people had received colonial education and should be able to speak a few words of English. This made me have a deep aversion, and whenever British or Americans treated me as a "superior Chinese person" and tried to chat with me in English, I would immediately throw these words back at them.</p>
<p>"Aren't you speaking English right now?" Another foreigner laughed.</p>
<p>"I can only speak this sentence," I also laughed. "If you can speak French, please talk in French. Then it will be more convenient for everyone."</p>
<p>Most British and American youths who have received a university education can speak a few words of French. So the two foreigners talked to me in French that was barely intelligible.</p>
<p>These were two young Canadian travelers. They planned to stay in Shanghai for a month or two. They heard that Minhang was very close to Shanghai, and they wanted to play for half a day, hoping to see something novel. Foreigners are very curious.</p>
<p>"Are you going to Minhang too?" One of the foreigners asked, looking at the bouquet in my hand.</p>
<p>"No, I'm getting off here."</p>
<p>"Does your home live here?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The car happened to stop at this time, and the driver called loudly: "XX Cemetery".</p>
<p>"Isn't there just a cemetery here?" One of the foreigners asked, his eyes widened.</p>
<p>"Yes. But my woman lives here." I said, holding the bouquet, and got out of the car.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Amidst the caretaker's joyful cry of "The gentleman has come again", I walked into the cemetery.</p>
<p>This is now my wife's home, which is also my future home. Next to where my wife is sleeping peacefully, isn't there a vacant lot left?</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Li Yixiang seemed to want to laugh, but was in an awkward state, trying not to laugh.</p>
<p>"The scene of today's parade was truly tragic! It can really chill the imperialists -- the courage of our enemies! He's scared, he doesn't dare participate! Ha! Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>Li Yixiang pointed at Chen Huamin and laughed loudly.</p>
<p>":::The courage of those children is still a bit lacking, they haven't been trained well. Fortunately, we encouraged them a bit.:::The results were pretty good. Today's results were pretty good.:::Isn't that right, Mr. Lin?"</p>
<p>Li Yixiang turned his head and asked Haiquan at the end. Haiquan thought, why is Li Yixiang so rude, bragging to his face? Fortunately, he was at the scene from beginning to end and witnessed the demonstration parade. Li Yixiang was just calling out those comrades who didn't participate in the demonstration. But he was still helpless and just nodded to show his affirmation.</p>
<p>"Now we have to find a way to rescue those who were arrested.:::"</p>
<p>After Chen Huamin said this, the whole living room was silent again.</p>
<p>Haiquan wanted to ask Li Yixiang several times why he brought a copy of the Old and New Testaments to participate in the demonstration today? He felt that this was a strange mystery. But he was afraid of provoking Mr. Li's anger, so he patiently refrained from asking.</p>
<p>Seeing them arguing every time they discussed something, Haiquan thought, this is really the expression of the petty-bourgeoisie's inferior nature that Tang Yaoxing often mentioned.</p>
<p>They were all cold to Haiquan, and seeing them begin to discuss community affairs that were unrelated to Haiquan, Haiquan bid farewell and came out, feeling a burst of emptiness.</p>
<p>Standing by the tram stop, he raised his head and looked at the sky, the moon was high and small, with a pale green color, and the surrounding area was filled with cold wind.</p>
<p>Thirty-five</p>
<p>When Haiquan returned to Cao Shiguang's residence in Sanyuan Lane, Oujia Lane, it was already a quarter to eleven.</p>
<p>Haiquan saw that Qiuying had returned first, but had not yet removed her new outfit for going out. She was standing in front of the bed, bending over, as if she was settling a child to sleep. The child was crying.</p>

<h3 id="e201">A Gathering of Heroes <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Fu</p>
<p>Recently, the frontline battles have failed to capture the attention of the people of our country. The eyes of our countrymen have all turned to Washington, across the ocean, watching the new play about to be staged in Washington. Haven't the selections for representatives to the Washington Conference been a clamorous topic domestically these past few days? The names "Minister Song" and "President Sun" have been the subject of enough noise here. Now, after "careful" consideration by the government and "humble" deferrals by "the individuals themselves," it has been decided that Minister Song will take the stage. In the near future, Minister Song will set sail, playing a role in the Washington Conference.</p>
<p>The Washington Conference is convened by the newly elected President of the United States, Mr. Roosevelt. The invited countries are a select few powerful nations. Small countries are naturally excluded (China, surprisingly, is also invited, gaining a place among the ranks of the powerful, which is truly an honor). The representatives of each participating country are mostly powerful and top-tier figures, fully capable of representing their respective countries' will, such as the British Prime Minister MacDonald, the former French Prime Minister Herriot, the Italian Minister of Finance Jung, and the Japanese diplomatic elder statesman Ishii Kikujiro, all of whom are outstanding talents and heroes of their time. This conference is truly nothing less than a "gathering of heroes" from the great powers.</p>
<p>So, what will this "gathering of heroes" discuss? The scope of discussion is not small: the entire war debt problem, the World Economic Conference, tariff policies, international exchange rates, world trade, disarmament issues, and the general global situation, among other things. As for the Far East issue, which is closely related to our country, it is said that it is also "planned" to be discussed. Precisely because we heard that "the Sino-Japanese issue will also be 'planned' to be discussed," the people of our country are craning their necks, hoping that this conference will provide a fair judgment and forceful sanctions on the Sino-Japanese problem. Our government is also paying special attention to the selection of representatives for this reason.</p>
<p>The outcome of the talks is, of course, beyond our ability to predict. However, it is absolutely impossible for the Sino-Japanese problem to advance towards resolution during these talks. Even if progress is made, it may not be beneficial to us. We should not be deluded by Roosevelt's slogan of promoting international cooperation. This so-called "international" is merely the international of imperialist countries, and the so-called cooperation is merely the alliance of imperialists. This is evident from the fact that socialist Soviet Russia and other small countries have not been invited.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is their common enemy. The main purpose of this conference is to prepare a united front against their common enemy and to lay the foundation for a capitalist anti-Soviet alliance. To lay a solid front, they must first resolve the deep-seated panic they share, so economic issues become the theme of discussion. To achieve consistent unity, they must temporarily eliminate the conflicts within imperialism itself, so international cooperation becomes the slogan. Didn't Roosevelt hint at abandoning the United States' eight-year-old policy of diplomatic isolation? This fully proves that the United States has decided to join the anti-Soviet front. Anglo-American cooperation will be promoted during this conference, and the conflict between Japan and the United States will also be eased. If Anglo-American cooperation succeeds, Britain's war debts may not become a major international problem for the time being. If the conflict between Japan and the United States temporarily disappears, it will inevitably lead to the United States recognizing Japan's position in the Far East. The most fundamental and acute opposition in the world is between Britain and the United States, and between Japan and the United States. If these two oppositions can be temporarily eased, the anti-Soviet front can be formed. This is the fundamental goal of this conference. Therefore, under these circumstances, the Far East issue has become a key to achieving their goals. In this way, is China's hopeful anticipation of a fair judgment not a dream!</p>

<p>— Xian</p>
<p>The Old Master and Madam</p>
<p>The Old Master and Madam are the protagonists of Shanghai night talks. In Shanghai morning talks, aside from the brief appearances of those returning from dance halls, exhausted from dancing, being carried from cars into small Western-style houses, the Old Master and Madam mentioned here are naturally different people, sleeping soundly on wild duck down mattresses, seeking sweet dreams. If you don't believe me, please read on.</p>
<p>My home is in a very bustling alley along the road. All kinds of noisy sounds, whether from inside the alley or from the road, are clearly delivered to our ears all day long. There is no peace and quiet during the day, and one cannot sleep peacefully at night. The quietest time of day is usually when I return from work. It usually doesn't seem to be a problem for me, but as soon as dawn breaks, the Shanghai people's experienced and high-pitched voices scream from the hoarse throats of the Old Master and Madam. The maids and horses neigh loudly. My tired body cannot help but curse them in the position of a petty bourgeois, scolding them for disturbing my peaceful dreams, for being tasteless things! When the red sun sets in the west, I get out of bed again, and I can't help but think, what am I working so hard for every day? The Old Master and Madam are the same as me. Their hoarse voices are like my hands, and their high-pitched screams are like the words I write. I have to eat, don't they have to eat? I have to sleep peacefully, don't they sleep peacefully? Aren't they afraid of the oppression of early frost and cold dew? Regardless of the cold or heat, it's like this every day, every year, without rest, working hard, for the sake of a few cents of income every day, going back to support the old and raise the young, sustaining the family's life. If they don't work for a day, they don't eat for a day. So often, from the days of "tipping" young masters and daughters, until they become Old Master and Madam, they are still doing the hard work of the "tipping" generation. They never have good food, good clothes, or good housing. The mark of their life becomes a hoarse voice, still "tipping," "tipping," reaching the end of their lives.</p>
<p>Although they do such dirty work, can we do without them? How many people living in Shanghai have big houses with flush toilets? Because they do dirty work, they are despised by gentlemen and adults, but if Shanghai didn't have them, do the Old Master and Madam who sit in cars and dance know what kind of world Shanghai would become?</p>
<p>Relying on one's own strength, eating one's own food, this is exactly the kind of talent needed today!</p>
<p>I rub my shy eyelids and don't curse them for being tasteless things just because I haven't woken up. After hurriedly smoking a cigarette, I drag my heavy footsteps, using my hands to grab what I eat, wear, and live on.</p>
<p>But at this time, it is almost evening, and the Old Master and Madam are dressed neatly to pursue their pleasures in a snow-white 1933 Austin, with new clothes made of silk and satin, chasing each other in the neon lights.</p>
<p>I bury myself in the pile of drafts, looking at the clock on the wall, wondering if I can go home a little earlier today, before the Old Master and Madam start working.</p>
<p>Arithmetic</p>
<h3 id="e203">A Simple Method for Converting Between Taels and Dollars <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Having read Mr. Yongxiang's "Another Quick Method for Correcting the Conversion of Two Dollars," which can calculate up to the hundred-thousandth place and is extremely accurate, I find that the mnemonic is quite complex and not easy to memorize. At the beginning of the change from taels to dollars, I created a "Flying Return Mnemonic for Taels to Dollars Conversion," which is simple, easy to remember, and accurate even when calculating to the ten-millionth or hundred-millionth place. Now, I will record my Chinese mnemonic below:</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Mnemonic</p>
<p>For two, add one, two eight five</p>
<p>For two, add two, add five seven</p>
<p>For three, add four, add one four</p>
<p>For four, add five, four two five</p>
<p>For five, add six, add seven one</p>
<p>For six, add eight, add two eight</p>
<p>For seven, add nine, five six five</p>
<p>For eight, add ten, subtract one five</p>
<p>Algorithm: Similar to ordinary division, from left to right, but in ordinary division, division is always followed by division. This method always follows division with an addition. Only the last sentence of the mnemonic is a divisor. For example, "For one, add one, two eight five." If the first digit of the number is one, remove one from that digit, add one to the digit above it, and add two eight five from the digit below it. The rest is analogous. The second half of the first seven sentences of the mnemonic are all addition numbers. The use or non-use of the word "add" is to make the sentence surface neat and easy to read aloud, so it has nothing to do with the algorithm. Only the last sentence, "add ten," must be paid attention to, as it adds one to the digit two places above the original digit. If you encounter eight, add nine, you can calculate it with the last sentence of the mnemonic and then treat the remainder as one and return it with the first sentence of the mnemonic. If the remainder is two or three, return it with the second or third sentence of the mnemonic. The numbers "add one" and "add two" are the quotients, and the addition numbers in the second half of the sentence are the remainders. The reason for not creating a mnemonic for encountering eight or nine is that the more mnemonics there are, the harder they are to memorize. For example, encountering one can also create a mnemonic "For one, add two, subtract four three." Encountering two can also create a mnemonic "For two, add three, subtract one four five." When there is something to subtract, it is very convenient, but when there is nothing to subtract, it is not applicable. Now there is a sentence "For seven, add ten, subtract one five" to adjust it. Other division mnemonics can also be omitted together. After the method is completely calculated, the unit of the quotient is one digit before the unit of the divisor. This is the simplest and most accurate method I have learned through experience. I record it to await the correction of arithmetic experts. As for the method of converting dollars to taels, my proposed method is consistent with that written by Mr. Yongxiang, so I will not repeat it.</p>

<p>A Maid with No Pay</p>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am a weak woman, who came here at the age of seven, and it has been eleven years now. My status is nominally an adopted daughter, but in fact, I am a "maid with no pay." In the past eleven years, the suffering I have endured is truly beyond words. Recently, life has become even more unbearable, and I have to do everything myself. But after working like a beast of burden all year round, the price I get, besides a few old clothes that can barely cover my body, and three meals a day of leftovers, is only "swallowing my anger" and "being scolded." I have long wanted to escape this environment, but I have never had the opportunity. Two years ago, I was fortunate enough to meet a man three years older than me; he also loves me very much. In these two years, we have come to know each other: so it is only natural to want to marry. I also know that the best way is to ask my master to fulfill our wish. But he is of course also considered to be a lowly person by the general public, so how can he have such connections? Besides, my master is treating me as a field that has already been plowed, so how can he agree to it? Unable to do so, I thought of the next best thing, so I asked him to elope with me; but he is, after all, a good person: afraid of violating the law, so he dared not try it for a while. Sir, if I really eloped with him, would it implicate him? Besides this, is there any other way for me to achieve the life I want? Please give me a detailed answer within the next two or three days. I am sincerely looking forward to it here! I wish you</p>
<p>Good Health, Shen Suzhen</p>

<p>Editor's Note: Although the above letter has undergone considerable modification by us, the original letter is still able to express its meaning. For a woman who has been an adopted daughter since she was a child, to be able to have such accomplishments, her master does not seem to be very vicious. Therefore, in this matter, we still advocate explaining it to Ms. Shen's master. You can tell them this idea yourself, without necessarily having to find a third party to convey the message. You might as well say, "My mind is made up, even if you don't agree, I will definitely do this." It would be best if they could meet the trend and allow your request. If they don't, contrary to your expectations, and refuse to let you go, then you can ask a lawyer to dissolve your relationship with them first, which is easy to do丨Then marry your partner. "Elopement" is really not a good idea, implicating him and subjecting him to the law is of course inevitable; and once you run away, your lives will definitely be threatened丨Please think twice before you act丨</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>He was thinking hard, praying bitterly, hoping that he could hook and safely rescue Wang Guodong, who had committed public anger. Because he was thinking too hard, his nerves had temporarily changed, causing him to stand there vaguely for a long time without returning to his seat. Fortunately, he was the leader of the whole school. Although people noticed, no one interfered. Moreover, most of the participants were listening quietly to the chairman's report on the stage with bated breath, and had no time to pay attention to the headmaster's change of behavior. However, he did not hear a single sentence of the chairman's report on the stage. When he gradually calmed down, he only heard the people under the stage straightening their voices and shouting desperately:</p>
<p>"Severely punish the greedy and traitorous Wang Guodong!"</p>
<p>"Expel Wang Guodong, who damaged the reputation of the whole school!"</p>
<p>Among them, there was also a group of radical elements roaring angrily.</p>
<p>"Quick, tie him up and parade him through the streets!"</p>
<p>"Punish him to stand in a wooden cage for half a month!"</p>
<p>Finally, many young people with the most intense emotions actually raised their thick arms, glared their terrible eyes, and squeezed together to rush to the stage to take action.</p>
<p>Wang Guodong was in a situation of being besieged on all sides. He wanted to escape but could not, he wanted to beg for mercy but it was useless. Seeing that he was about to suffer a big loss, he tightly protected his head with his two arms, squatted down halfway, and his teeth were clattering, almost scared to death.</p>
<p>"Now everyone's opinions are almost the same! We must not simply expel this shameless thing. We must punish him severely. Well, let's discuss the method of punishment丨" From the presidium, a person with a very loud voice and a very brave attitude came out, stopped everyone's confusion, and said a few words to summarize the outline.</p>
<p>Wu Yi took a closer look and realized that the speaker was his son, Wu Yuan.</p>
<p>"He must be punished to stand in a wooden cage for a month!"</p>
<p>"Compel his family to donate 10,000 yuan to the volunteer army as atonement!"</p>
<p>"Starting tomorrow, make him publish in the newspaper for ten days, confessing his crimes!"</p>
<p>Although the emergency action was stopped by Wu Yuan, the methods of punishment proposed by all parties became more and more fierce. Some even advocated sending Wang Guodong to the garrison headquarters to be shot according to the law. Just as they were arguing, Wu Yi had moved his steps and walked to the podium.</p>
<p>"Listen to Principal Wu's opinion"! Liu Ji, the executive committee member of the Student Anti-Japanese Association who was standing in the center, thought that Wu Yi also had some opinions on punishing Wang Guodong, so he shouted, making everyone under the stage stop speaking, so that he could speak.</p>
<p>"Chairman, may I ask what Wang Guodong has done wrong?" Wu Yi was determined to defend Wang Guodong and had to first find out the cause.</p>
<p>"Principal丨Didn't you hear our report just now?" Liu Ji showed a very surprised look, reluctantly enduring, and repeated: "Wang Guodong is the director of the inspection team of the Anti-Japanese Association, and he bears a great responsibility. Unexpectedly, the Student Union sent someone to warn us recently, saying that not only was our inspection ineffective, but also someone had been bribed by unscrupulous merchants and secretly issued those seals of "already inspected" covers, so that Japanese goods could still be sold smoothly. After we received this warning, we investigated strictly, and we found out that Wang Guodong had done a good thing alone丨"</p>
<p>"Is there any evidence?" Wu Yi questioned.</p>
<p>"How can there be no丨" Liu Ji expressed great dissatisfaction with Wu Yi's questioning. "We have arrested two owners of foreign sundry goods stores, and they have all confessed. Even Wang Guodong himself does not deny it丨Therefore, we only need to discuss how to punish him now丨"</p>
<p>As soon as Liu Ji finished speaking, several other students crowded around two middle-aged men who looked like merchants, squeezing to Wu Yi's face, meaning: "The witnesses are all here, don't believe you ask yourself丨" With such corroboration, even if Wang Guodong's father丨Wang Yulin, a lawyer who has been in practice for more than 20 years, came to defend him in person, it would be impossible to recover. Not to mention Wu Yi, who is not good at eloquence丨</p>
<p>"Well::, then let's just expel him丨" Wu Yi planned to allow the expulsion of Wang Guodong to ease the atmosphere on the stage.</p>

<h3 id="e207">An Analysis of Huaress Pylath's Success <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>Attributes Ugly Looks to Be His Main Reason</p>
<p>The face of the great star Huaress Pylath in "Grand Hotel" is so ugly that even dogs would run away from it. One can imagine how unattractive his appearance is. But movie fans all over the world find his face lovable. Whether he plays a robber, a thief, a scoundrel, or a hypocrite, they all praise his good performance. Isn't that strange? Here is a passage in which he analyzes his own success. He attributes it to his own ugly appearance. I have seen the portraits of emperors of past dynasties collected in the Qing Palace, some of which are so strangely ugly that they do not resemble human rulers. For example, the appearance of Ming Taizu was like a pig, extremely ugly; but physiognomists said that although this was a pig shape, it was actually born of a pig dragon, which was extremely noble, so he could become the Son of Heaven. Therefore, those with strange and ugly appearances are either extremely lowly or extremely noble. Now this Huaress Pylath, with his big nose, wide mouth slightly protruding forward, also looks somewhat like a pig. Therefore, he was a shepherd boy in his childhood (once herding elephants for others), and now he is a great star, jumping from extreme lowliness to great wealth. I am now translating his words and publishing them in the Shen Bao Film Magazine, to give the ugly people of the world a chance to vent their anger. (The following is Pylath's own speech)</p>
<p>"You ask me how I became famous? Even I myself don't know. If I knew, I would definitely tell you. (He squinted at himself from a mirror on the wall of the dressing room and continued) Maybe it's because my appearance is too outrageous! I don't think there is any other reason besides that. But I really didn't expect my appearance to make a lot of money. However (he was a little shy) I wasn't ugly when I was a kid. Have you seen my childhood photos? Don't look down on me. I even joined a song and dance troupe丨My brother Noah and I performed in a song and dance troupe, and that was the first step I took in acting. Think about what it would be like to see the two of us open our hippopotamus-like mouths, singing and dancing!</p>
<p>"When I paired with other people in plays, the love of the woman always belonged to other people at the end of the play. I wasn't angry either, because that's how it is. With this face, one shouldn't fantasize about winning a woman's love丨</p>
<p>"But when it comes to being ugly, I also have many advantages that pretty boys can't match. First, I don't need makeup. My natural map can be used to my advantage everywhere. Second, I don't need to prop up the scene, because I don't play the roles of upper-class gentlemen. Third, I don't have to worry about my bald head. Fourth, no one laughs at me for picking my teeth in public. Fifth, no one cares if I don't shave for three days. Sixth, I'm not afraid of getting old. People feel the sense of beauty fading when they find a wrinkle on their forehead in the mirror; I'm not afraid, the more wrinkles, the better. As for my hair, I can cut it into a flat top or leave it messy, it's really advantageous everywhere.</p>
<p>"I once argued with Mary Tolan. Although she won at the time, I'm still not convinced to this day. When we were filming Min and Bill, Mary and I argued about who was uglier. I thought I was the ugliest, but she insisted that she was the ugliest. In the midst of the breakup, I had to give in because she was an old lady. In fact, she was just a little older, how could she compare to my ugliness!"</p>
<p>(He stood up and looked at the mirror next to him and said) "I get uglier every year, but the uglier the better丨"</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3 id="e208">A Few Idle Words on "The Ball of Light and Pearl Shadow" <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Yesterday, I watched "The Ball of Light and Pearl Shadow" at "Xin Guang." This morning, I read the review in the Shen Bao film supplement and felt compelled to say a few idle words. Mr. "Ling He" seems to have misunderstood some aspects of the film's story and the motivation and background behind its creation.</p>
<p>Regarding the story: The main point is that the protagonist, based on his own experience, nearly falls into a state of irredeemable depravity due to a single misstep. Seeing that his younger brother is about to repeat his mistake, he devises a plan during a football game to subdue his brother's arrogance, preventing him from succumbing to the temptations of a wicked society. This is truly a lesson in ethical friendship and chivalrous spirit.</p>
<p>As for the motivation: The story of this film merely serves as an interlude. The real motivation for filming it lies in the two football matches. The American people's fervor for college football games has a history of half a century. Every fall and winter, at each college football game in various cities and towns, the number of spectators often reaches one or two hundred thousand, showcasing the grandeur and frenzy. All universities regard recruiting and training elite football teams as the sole means to enhance their school's reputation. Each year, at the end of the football season, a selection of honorary team members for the "All-American Team" and the "All-American Second Team" is held, determined by a judging panel composed of the most prestigious football coaches nationwide. However, matches involving these honorary teams have never been held. The American film industry, discerning the public's psychology, incorporated a scene from the Universal Pictures new film "The Speculative Madam." This film opens today. at the Xin Guang Grand Theater. The female lead is Katie Naje. She previously starred in "The Fairy of Neon Clothes" and "Happy Foes," which were screened in Shanghai. Those who have seen the above two films may not have forgotten the lady's beauty and artistry.</p>
<p>The studio hired players selected for the "All-American Team" in 1930 and 1931 to film the movie. Therefore, the English name remains "All Americans." As for the two brothers who are the protagonists of the film, although they are purely film actors, in reality, they were both renowned football players during their time at school. Furthermore, concerning the background: given the national fervor for football, although university students can gain temporary fame in football or sports while in school, after graduation, they often lack other skills besides sports, ultimately leading to unemployment and depravity. Therefore, the film carries a satirical intent, urging young students not to be blinded by vanity and neglect their studies. The inclusion of women and society in the film is nothing more than to encourage students to be wary of the evils of society, and to increase the interest of the story. Finally, the purpose of my idle words is because I saw that most of the audience yesterday were young students, just like the master in the movie.</p>
<h3 id="e209">"Exploiting the Poor" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Xingguang</p>
<p>Having not set foot inside a theater for two whole months, I could no longer suppress the burgeoning desire to see a play. In the daytime, I fished out the only two dimes in my pocket and headed straight for the "Proletarian XX Grand Theater." Before I knew it, the exterior of the XX Grand Theater, from blurred to distinct, was entirely before my eyes. I fished out the two dimes in my pocket, ready to exchange them for a ticket.</p>
<p>I strode into the theater's entrance and slapped the two dimes onto the ticket window, putting on the pompous air of a patron, and said, "Change!"</p>
<p>"Quite the coincidence!" The ticket seller sized me up for a moment and said.</p>
<p>"It's a big coin!" I said again in surprise.</p>
<p>"It's the theater's rule; large and small coins are used equally."</p>
<p>"Oh! A large coin is the same as a small coin:" I shivered, took the ticket, and walked despondently into the darkened space. The four words "exploiting the poor" surged into my mind.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: I will publish your manuscript; you can see two more movies next month. But it is better to change the money to small coins to prevent being exploited again.</p>
<h3 id="e210">"Oppression" Filming Completed <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Jingguan</p>
<p>The Latest Production by Mingxing Company</p>
<p>Recently, the Mingxing Film Company completed another silent film, which was unofficially screened at the Central Grand Theater on the night of the spring rain.</p>
<p>The name of this film is "Oppression." The director is Gao Lihen. The protagonist is a weak-willed worker whose factory is forced to close down due to economic oppression by big capitalists, causing him to lose his job. After losing his job, he can't think of a solution and has to let his wife go out to work as a servant. As a result, his wife is taken away by someone else, and his old mother and daughter die in the snow. Finally, he finds a job, but he is framed again, and eventually goes to prison with lingering grief and hatred. In this film, the hard lives of the so-called lower class are depicted in detail. The leading roles are played by Gong Jianong as the worker and Xia Peizhen as the worker's wife. These two are even more impressive when playing the role of unkempt and poor people than when wearing suits and qipaos. There is also an important female role, played by Yan Yuexian. According to her personality, she naturally plays the role of a fashionable and beautiful socialite in the film.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Seven Companies Join Forces to Film a Patriotic Movie. It is Said That the Government Has Agreed to Assist. <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zong</p>
<p>The "National Salvation Through Aviation," which was heavily promoted in Shanghai, cannot be considered a failure. However, the people who have not joined the association in Shanghai cannot be considered a small minority. Therefore, the enthusiastic members of the film industry have thought of using film as a propaganda tool to produce a large-scale "National Salvation Through Aviation" film to expand publicity, so that our people will possess a heart for national salvation, raise funds to purchase more aircraft to resist the rampaging Japanese aircraft, save our country, and protect the lives and property of our people, so that the enemy cannot succeed in harming our people.</p>
<p>Now those enthusiasts in the film industry have already had two meetings and decided that the cooperating companies are seven in total. There are three sound film companies:</p>
<p>1.  Hehe Company. 2. Mingxing Company. 3. Tianyi Company. There are four silent film companies. 1. Lianhua Company. 2. Jinan Company. 3. Dadong Company. 4. Yueming Company. These seven companies are cooperating with each other. Each company is responsible for filming three thousand or one thousand feet of film. The film equipment, scenery, developing, actors, directors, and everything else are all the obligations of each company to save the country. The film is stipulated to be silent, probably to facilitate screening during village publicity.</p>
<p>On the 24th of this month, these seven patriotic companies will hold a script committee meeting. Each company will send representatives to attend, and each company will draft a short script material. The length of this material is also consistent with the film. Then the committee will discuss how to connect the film into a coherent whole and successfully produce a great film of anti-Japanese propaganda.</p>
<p>It is said that the government is willing to assist in the production of this film. Whether it is warships, aircraft, troops, or military equipment, they can all be borrowed. Presumably, the success of this film will be a new record for great films of anti-Japanese national salvation.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Film Novel Cavalcade (1) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Ne</p>
<p>"Cavalcade" is produced by the American Fox Company, but the actors and directors, everything is British. This publication has already introduced the production process of "Cavalcade" on the 29th and 30th of last month by Lin Jun. Now, I will ask Ne Jun to excerpt its plot and publish it daily to resonate with readers.</p>
<p>That day was New Year's Eve again. In the Merrio family, Qi Yin and Robert, after ten years of marriage, were as happy as if it were just one day. As usual, at twelve o'clock on New Year's Eve, the couple would raise their glasses to celebrate, to bid farewell to the past year of peace and welcome the birth of a year of peace. But this year was not like the previous years. Today, what was being sent off was not an ordinary year, but a century, because that day was December 31, 1899.</p>
<p>The new century is like a new life. And at the beginning of this new century, Britain had already engaged in war with Dutch farmers stationed in South Africa. Within the new year, Robert had to pack his bags and go to defend his country with arms. Qi Yin was heartbroken at the thought of this. The ten years of harmonious family life had been enveloped by a cold and rainy atmosphere. Her husband had to go on a long expedition, and both of her sons were still young. From then on, the days would only increase her sorrow.</p>
<p>Qi Yin's eyes were filled with tears, and they had not dried for a day. She looked at the pot of flowers given to her by the servants and pointed to her husband, saying, "The smaller the things, the more they move people's hearts. I want to cry." She sobbed, "A few tears to welcome the new century."</p>
<p>Robert held her, and she gained infinite courage. At this time, the distant clock had not yet struck, and this moment still belonged to the old century, the peaceful era that Robert and she shared. She stared at his face and asked, "We have been so happy since we got married!"</p>
<p>"Until now?" Qi Yin also knew the fear in Robert's heart. "Why not leave some leeway for the future?"</p>
<p>Qi Yin cried. "Who knows if there will be a future? Alas, baby, darling, why must you leave me? How can I bear it?"</p>
<p>"The bugle has sounded!" Robert smiled. He had to smile; if he didn't smile, he could only cry with her, because he himself had unresolved bitterness. "The bugle has sounded, the national flag is flying." Then he hummed a military song, "Britons will never be slaves to others."</p>

<h3 id="e213">Williams' New Car Adapts to the New Era <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Lower Price Than Before, More Perfect Manufacturing Than Before, the Most Ideal, Most Beautiful and Cheapest Car. Times change and things change with them. Today's world can truly be called a new world. Williams Ofrin has seen through the trend of this realistic new world, and began to manufacture 1933-style cars, sweeping away the old atmosphere of the past to adapt to the special economic situation of the time.</p>
<p>When Williams Ofrin Company designed and manufactured the 1933-style car, it was determined to take into account those in society who have reduced their income by more than 50% since 1929. Therefore, the price of the new car must be suitable for the reduced purchasing power, and the beauty of its style and the greatness of its function must not be reduced in the slightest, so that it can be happily used by the most discerning customers. The company also learned that the general purchasing habits of society are completely opposite to those of the past. They often care about how much they spend, and they must get 100 points of value for every yuan they spend, because it is far more difficult to make money than it used to be. Therefore, the company decided that the new car should not only be cheap to buy, but also save on all daily maintenance costs in order to adapt to the purchasing power of the general public.</p>
<p>The Car Style is Unique</p>
<p>The company's 1933 car style has completely changed its old appearance and is brand new. Based on scientific principles and imitating the structure of airplanes, it increases the maximum speed without adding fuel costs, and its body posture is more beautiful than the old style. In short, Williams Ofrin's new car can be called the most complete car with a streamlined design adopted by the general public.</p>
<p>Even its car lights are based on the streamlined style, installed on the protective board and tilted backwards to match the car lines, and the light is radiated directly to the front, and because of the angle of the car lights, the light distribution is more satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Biggest Goal is Economy</p>
<p>The company's biggest goal is to make cars more economical, so the savings in daily maintenance costs are as important as reducing the purchase price. The creation of Williams 77 uses one gallon of American gasoline and can travel 25 to 30 miles, and one gallon of machine oil can travel 1,000 miles, which is clear evidence that the company has achieved its goal. In fact, the company has reduced transportation costs by half, which is consistent with the amount of reduction in public benefits.</p>
<p>Regarding the performance of the new car, the company also knows that in this era, transportation is of utmost importance, so the structure of the new car meets the needs of the most demanding drivers. It can travel 70 miles per hour, and thanks to its patented "buoyancy," it can also be smoother than usual, which is one of its characteristics. Also, the high speed of its second gear ensures smooth operation and rapid movement.</p>
<p>There are Many Features, Roughly Listed Below</p>
<p>The Williams 77 is equipped with a four-cylinder engine that can generate 48 horsepower and 3,200 revolutions per minute. The exhaust valve is in a suitable position, making it convenient for the driver. The piston is made of pig iron and has three compression rings and one oil return ring. The clutch and transmission are old-fashioned. The clutch is made of a whole metal sheet with a diameter of eight inches. The cylinder diameter is nine inches and the width is one inch and six points. Just apply slight pressure on the pedal and the action will follow.</p>
<p>The entire car body is made of pure steel. The car frame uses a double vertical X-style, which is the latest style of car frame. The front and rear are extremely strong. The front and rear seats are quite wide, and the spring cushions are very deep and stable. They are tilted backwards at the correct angle, so they are very comfortable. The front of the 77 sedan has a single seat that can be moved. There is a small drawer next to it for placing scattered packages.</p>
<p>The wheel diameter is seventeen inches, the rim is three inches, and the tire is five inches. The wheels are also manufactured in a streamlined style. The front axle is based on the old-fashioned style, with very little curvature, so the torsion is very strong.</p>
<p>The fire manager is fully automatic. The heat shield can be adjusted at any time. Other equipment such as hydraulic front and rear shock absorbers, non-glare front windows, oil filters, rearview mirrors, rubber pedals, foot accelerator, etc. are all complete.</p>
<p>This is the Crystallization of Twenty-Six Years</p>
<p>This Williams Ofrin 1933 new car is the greatest achievement in its 26-year history. It has exhausted its spirit, financial resources, and all equipment to achieve this success. In a world where economic power is declining, if you want to enjoy a car that meets the needs of the times, where else can you look? Therefore, the above is a brief description of the advantages of its new car, so that those who buy cars know where to ask.</p>
