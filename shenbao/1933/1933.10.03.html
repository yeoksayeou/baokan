<p>（一）五全大會展期　前星期四日中央常會决議五全大會展期一年舉行、其原因已在决議上面說明、照總章第二十七條規定、全國代表大會遇有不得已情形、可以展期舉行、但最多不得過一年、如今不得已而展期的原因、第一是陳濟棠李宗仁兩委員來電提議展期、陳李兩委員已在來電内附舉理由、第二是華北戰區善後工作以及剿匪工作、皆未完竣、大會展期一年、更可以在這一年之中加倍努力、以期於大會未開之前完成這兩件重要工作、五全大會展期會不會發生什麽障碍呢、我們知道五全大會有兩個目的、其一、許多人希望五全大會開成、則國民大會提前召集之議案可以提出、本年提前召集國民大會之議案、預備在七月一日之臨時代表大會提出的、七月一日臨時大會旣不開、而十一月之五全大會又展期、豈不是國民大會之召集、也會受了影響、中央方面對於這個問題、已有過嚴密的考慮、所以同時决議仍依去年十二月三中全會的决議、於二十四年三月召集國民大會、而此時即由國民政府着手籌備、如選舉法、組織法、以及會塲建築等等、均要積極進行、所以提前召集、雖然做不到、但三中全會的决議、仍是照舊進行的、須知道國民大會之召集、是需要相當時間的、如果七月一日臨時大會開得成、則國民大會之召集、希望可以由二十四年三月提前一年改爲二十三年三月、如此則由本年七月至下年三月間還有八九個月的籌備時間、七月臨時大會旣開不成就算十一月五全大會開得成、要在廿三年三月召集國民大會、也籌備不及了、因此中央常會、便不空說提前、仍决定照原議籌備黨治、以養成民主政治爲其最終之目的、唯其如此、所以我們所要求的是眞的憲政、不是假的憲政、惟其如此、所以纔有訓政之必要、我們今日要十二分努力完成訓政時期所應該做工作、以期導入眞的憲政國民大會雖因時間所限不能提前、但國民大會之召集、絕不因這次五全大會之展期而發生障碍的、其二就於黨的方面來說、現在最重要的是精神團結、共赴國難、這八個字、可以說是同志今日一切工作的根本方針、五全大會不開、我們要繼續、這八個字做去、就算五全大會開成、我們也是要本着這八個字做去、九一八以後、四全大會、我們就已提出這八個字了、到了現在、不能說没做到一些、但也不能說完全做到、我們知道、革命同志都是熱情甚高的、對於時局認識確定以後、情緒熱烈實行之心、至爲迫切、因此遇着障碍、便急於排除往往因意見上之差池、糾紛隨之而起、是免不了的、如今爲着國難、我們就要集中精誠團結共赴國難八個字之下、爲較重大的問題而犧牲、較微小的意見、要這様才可以說是精誠團結、要這様才可以說是共赴國難、就算政治意見、不能犧牲、發生衝突、如果是出於爲黨爲國的忠誠、也是好的、那就可以依着黨的决議、實行政權的轉移、須知道對於一件事情、不但要有主張、而且要有責任、對於做事、不能只事排斥、而且要有担當、這才是政治的正軌、在憲政的國家、甲黨被排、乙黨就要來担當、一黨裏頭、如有幾個意見存在、也要如此、如果只是排斥、没有担當、是不行的、一年以來中央抱着這種忍耐負責的態度、固不敢說所做的會做錯處、但如果没有人起來担當、也就不能隨便就抛棄了我們所負的責任、我們今日還是本着這種精神忍耐的負責的做去、一面求黨内的團結、一面求國民的合作、相與努力、五全大會如果於今年十一月舉行、也不過是將四全大會以來精誠團結、共赴國難的經過檢閲一次、如果我們今日能夠加緊努力、使政治方面、如華北戰區善後工作、如勦匪工作、都能早日完成、黨務方面各方同志、都能屏除私見、共謀國是、則黨事國事决不因大會展期而發生障碍、而且到了明年大會舉行自然比今年開會更可以多一點安慰了、</p>
<p>（二）内蒙自治問題　最近蒙古王公有要求自治之舉、中央於此十分注意、這種自治之要求、是否是分離運動呢、是否是傀儡運動呢、現在我們還不敢斷定、不待詳查、要是分離運動傀儡運動的話、我們就只有切實制裁、再無他說、反之如果這種要求完全爲自治着想、則我們要稍爲說幾句話、自治不只是蒙古所需要的、整個中國都需要自治、自治是中國人共同的要求、尤其是本黨的主張、本黨同志出生入死努力奉行、建國大綱所規定的第一件重要工作、要是忘記自治的就不是總理的信徒、然自治之完成、不是猝然可期的完成自治有兩個先决條件、第一要平亂、第二要整理軍隊、亂事不平、軍隊不整理、正如五六月間的察哈爾省一個小小地方聚了二三十萬的散兵、試問如何自治呢、我們對於自治、决不能無故延宕做得到的馬上着手、做不到的就先要努力排除障碍、使之做得到、蒙古自有其特殊的情形、但我們今日在種族上·宗敎上習慣上·已實行平等自由之原則、互相尊重了、此外還有一件事、須注意的内蒙同胞還多是游牧爲生、游牧是需要極廣闊的土地的、今日世界最要緊的經濟原則要以較小的土地、養較多的人口、而游牧民族、適得其反、故蒙古之生產方式、實在有改變之必要、但蒙古同胞於此或以爲墾植之事漢人居多如此、則蒙人牧地將被壓迫、此種顧慮當然應該使之解除、而同時我們雖然要蒙古同胞由游牧進而耕種、但亦决不强迫、只是扶助進行便了、爲了這事中央已設立專門委員會、負責担任、總之、我們對於自治之進行、决不因不要求而延宕也不因要求而敷衍、我們所注意的是自治的障碍是否已經掃除、自治的工作是否可以開始、内地如此蒙古也是如此、蒙古地方遼闊、大多數人民的痛苦、政府關懷最切、自治應辦事項已責成内政部及蒙藏委員會負責辦理、要之、是眞正的自治與分離的或傀儡的運動截然兩件事不能混爲一談的、</p>
<p>（三）最近華北騷亂　最近華北騷亂是由方振武吉鴻昌兩人所造出來、大家如果還記得七月二十八日兄弟和蔣先生聯名所發之儉電、以及九月六日復陳濟棠李宗仁察廷鍇江電之麻電就會知道這一件亂事不是十分意料之外的、在儉電上面、我有一段說明察省斷斷不能養得偌多的散兵、並指出前一回多倫之失、乃由當地所駐散兵過多、大家食盡燒光、站脚不住、才被劉桂堂佔領、駐軍一日不整理、則察省一日不能安定、我們看到這點、所以對於察省軍隊之整理、十分注意、九月六日之麻電、曾將整理内容、詳細說明、所有各軍經多次接洽磋商之後、收編的收編、就職的也就職了、只有方振武吉鴻昌兩人、别有企圖始終不肯接受、有些報紙還以爲中央不曾安置他們、以致窮無所歸、而不知却是他們狼子野心、不受安置、現在他們部隊之中、尙有著名共黨張慕陶等在内、從前情形不明、有人尙爲方吉辯護、說他們志在抗日、如今事實擺在我們面前、他們却是企圖做劉豫張邦昌、卒致造成最近一亂事陽假抗日之名陰行叛國之實、眞是天下第一件醜事、好在亂事尙不很大、現在由北平軍事委員會負責處理、這一班劉豫張邦昌的種子必歸於掃滅、是無可疑的、</p>
<p>（四）經濟委員會問題、全國經濟委員會原由蔣介石先生任委員長、宋子文先生任副委員長、久經設立籌備處着手進行、此項棉麥借欵劃歸經濟委員會支配、指定專爲生產建設之用、蔣先生以自己身爲軍事委員會委員長、故堅决辭去經濟委員會委員長兼職、示國人以不移借欵爲軍事用之决心、現已由中央决定改推兄弟和孫哲生先生宋子文先生爲常務委員、大約日内即行就職、至於借欵用途、亦經已决定儘先用於棉紗救濟食糧救濟兩項、我國的棉紗事業瀕於破產、急待救濟、不容一刻再緩、即就糧食而言、荒年固成荒災、如今豐年亦成豐災了、從前我内地產麥滯銷的情形、兄弟曾在國府紀念週約略報告隨後更派内政財政鐵道實業四部恊同調查、至於產米滯銷情形、似更爲嚴重、有人以爲借了美麥國產麥才滯銷、然則不借美米、國產米何以也會滯銷呢、則原因别有所在、於此可見了、至於救濟方法、俟大體議定、再行報告、關於經濟委員會之組織、外間傳說甚多、或謂如何擴大、或謂增設若干處、這些傳說、都不大確、我們現時只添設了一個棉業統制委員會、因爲現時要着手於棉業统制、所以添設一個機關、或者將來再添設一個糧食委員會、須知我們要爲事而設機關、决不是爲機關而設事、說是如何擴大、如何增設、都是不確的、提到經濟問題、我還要附帶說一兩句關於財政的話、棉麥借欵旣全部用於生產建設、然則軍政費如何呢、自從九一八以來、軍政費都是不夠的、此是人人皆知的事實、不用細說、而最大痛心、則爲只有維持費、没有事業費、而且連維持費也不足、試問軍政若只以維持爲得計、而不用於事業、則尙有什麽意義呢、事業費之不可少、用不着多講、可以江西剿匪爲其舉例、現時江西勦匪、用兵固然要錢、而匪退之後、救濟地方、那更要錢、因爲那些地方均經共匪於退出之時、用極殘酷的堅壁清野的方法、摧毁無餘、眞成了一片赤地、房屋也没有了、耕牛也没有了、農具也没有了、種籽也没有了、呌殘餘的百姓們在這地方如何生活呢、我們於克復匪區之後、常常希望百姓們能合力自衛以防共匪之再來、然而有工具才能謀生、能謀生才能自衛、生存的工具尙且没有辦法、何從說到自衛呢、所以剿匪工作、於共匪旣去之後、必須着手於農村經濟復興、而復興之急務、第一就是救死、救死先使之能謀生一切被匪摧毁之房屋田地牛馬農具種籽都　得要一一預備、能謀生才能防衛、能防衛纔不致再爲共匪所蹂躪、由此可知剿匪工作、不但在軍事、尤在財政、如今有些人只管主張緊縮、甚至主張　爲而治、是實在未曾注意及此、然而這筆經濟、從何而來呢、軍政費困難旣如此、而匪區收復後、財政上之迫切需要又如此、政治當局軍事當局所處之困難、　此一端、可以具見了、前兩日兄弟赴滬晤商宋子文先生、、即是爲此問題、雖然想了些辦法、但在中央未决定以前、暫且不能報告、總而言之、今日正是我們同志苦幹窮幹的時代、惟其苦、故要苦幹、惟其窮、故尤其要窮幹、一切都可以犧牲、而救國的責任不能不担當、一切都可以退讓、而赴難精神不能不積極、救亡國存責任所在、是無可逃的（二日蝇央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c15">農村經濟注重調查　實 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>農村經濟在我國經濟問題中。具極重要關係。全國上下。近皆嚴　切注意。在政府方面則正以之與統制經濟問題相提並論。在一般社會與學術界。亦認此農村問題。如不獲正　解决。則一切經濟的建設。皆不能樹立基礎。是皆扼要之論也。古代儒家論政。本皆以農民耕織。爲齊家治國平天下之本。迄乎近代。資本主義經濟組織。輸入中國。機械工業。逐漸發達。舊日以農業爲中心之經濟結構。遂完全轉變而趨於城市。近代之經濟社會。表面上固以「交換」爲重點。實際猶在乎大工業之生產組織。且工業生產與金融資本其經濟週轉次數。較之農業生產一年或半年始週轉一次者。不可以道里計。於是農業益難立足。况最近五年來。世界經濟恐慌激劇。傾消政策盛行。我中華民國旣不能樹立高率關税以爲提防。又不能動員全國爲經濟之競爭。則我缺乏組織力之農村。不得不首受其破敗。</p>
<p>因農村經濟之崩潰。一面引起一般經濟恐慌之增劇。一面激盪社會之不安。於是「復興農村。」遂成爲全國共同一致之趨向。農村經濟之調查。亦已次第實施。就當前需要而論。此事誠不可少緩。所惜此種調查。僅屬於小規模行動。調查人員不過數人或十數人。調查區域。不過三數省。且在三數省中。僅及一部分。其所得材料至多亦不過表現某一地方之情形。而於整個中國農村經濟問題之解决。則獲效殊爲微小也。故吾人切望經濟委員會。能確切注意此一問題。爲全國大規模之具體考察。然後規劃方案。則非特直接有助於農村經濟組織之正當了解。間接亦可輔助政治建設之推進。今日調查農村經濟所最需要者。爲以下三點。第一應注意農村金融之週轉。我國農村技術。洵不如人。而農民之勤奮。則爲世所罕有。徒以限於季節。在北部諸省。年收一次。其金融週轉。乃亦必一年一次。長江流域最多不過二次。故亦須六個月始週轉一次。其不能適應當今一般經濟情况明矣。此種現狀。如不速謀改革。則農村將愈疲敝。第二。須着手土地關係之調查。我國農革村。早已形成一種過小農制。無論自耕農與佃農。生活水準皆極低下。土地分配。各地下同。而中央對此。亦乏正確統計。地方政府。又少詳實考察。今後復興農村之初步工作。必須對土地分配情形。求得切實瞭解。然後分别處理。乃能消弭糾紛。樹立基礎。第三·须注意農業生產品之調濟。我國農民思想。雖仍憧憬於一家族之自給自足。然事實上早已走上商品生產途徑。一旦榖物市場停滯。經濟即失其平衡。農村衰敗之結果。反映於城市。際此時期。必確實理解農業生產品在產源地之特殊情形。或設爲榖物公賣市場。或由國庫補助農民之損失。以爲調劑夫然後農村經濟。乃有更生之機也。</p>
<p>總之。我國國民經濟。以農業經濟窒息之故。致整個社會停滯於死點之上。設　今日而能超越此一點者。則經濟的復興。期年可待。而其唯一辦法。則視是否能解决農村問題爲</p>

<p>新老兩廠工人昨晨總怠工</p>
<p>大公社云、上海電力公司新廠工人怠工糾紛、因公司態度堅持、未能解决、老廠八百餘工人、亦於昨晨起響應怠工、工潮益趨嚴重、茲分紀各情如下、</p>
<p>老廠響應怠工　電力公司楊樹浦新廠工人、於二十九起宣告怠工後、翌晨卽被拒絕進廠、且公司態度依然强硬、老廠工人、爲表示援助起見、當經怠工委員會議决、全體八百餘工人、亦於昨晨起、一律響應、加入怠工、事前探悉廠方亦將同様拒絕進廠、故爲避免與廠方發生衝突、及其他不幸事件起見、暫不進廠、總計兩廠工人共二千餘名、除發電部份、仍照常維持外、其餘各部工作、已全部停頓、</p>
<p>發佈怠工紀律　怠工委員會爲整飭工人步驟計、昨發佈怠工紀律如下、（一）怠工期間、怠工委員會爲最高權力機關、（二）新老兩廠全體工友、應絕對服從怠工委員會之命令與指揮、（三）怠工期間、全體工友、應嚴守秩序、不得軌外行動、（四）怠工期間、不得揑造謠言、攪亂人心、（五）怠工期間、全體工友、應靜候糾紛之解决、不得故自驚攪與畏縮、（六）怠工期間全體工友、不得至廠前觀望、（七）怠工期間、各工友應至指定地點、探聽消息、不得聽信謠言、（八）工友中如不遵守上項紀律者、應以工賊論、（九）如有甘心走狗或工賊者、予以最嚴厲之處分、</p>
<p>兩廠戒備情形　自新老兩廠工人宣布總怠工後、廠方爲防止工人搗亂起見、滬東楊樹浦新廠洞庭路大門、由捕房派華印捕多人、駐守保護、其他如楊樹浦路進出各廠門、均有華捕二名駐守、戒備頗爲嚴密、斐倫路老廠、捕房亦派有華捕八人、西捕二人、印捕四人、在廠門附近、來往梭巡、但工人自實行怠工後、因廠方拒絕進廠、故昨日均未進廠、老廠工人、昨晨並赴市總工會開會、秩序極佳、</p>
<p>白俄開始工作　昨晨斐倫路老廠工人加人怠工後、該公司深恐糾紛延長、有碍發電、故卽僱用白俄五十餘名進廠預備替代、楊樹浦新廠如爐子間四部分、内外銅匠間、冷作間·打鐵間·吊煤間·挑線間·等各部分、均酌派俄人·於昨日起、開始工作、據發電間工人莊志順語大公社記者云、廠方雖雇用俄人替代、但事實上、白俄因缺少經騐、須二人替一華工、現發電部分尙未奉怠工委員會命令、故仍照常工作、以維電流、如廠方再不覺悟、則發電工人二百餘名、决一致自動怠工、以達最後勝利、屆時廠方雖僱用白俄代替、但對於維持發電、决難免發生問題也云云、</p>
<p>請願黨政援助　四區水電業工會、於昨晨推派代表倪天富·董生泉·陳友發等數人、先赴市政府請願、因昨日吳市長就任警備司令、各科負責人均往參加、無人接見、旋又赴市黨部請願、由民運科戴有恒接見、允請示常委再會同社會局進行調解、末赴社會局總工會作同様之請願、要求予以援助、其呈文如下、呈爲推派代表請願、仰祈鑒核、俯賜援助、以伸正義而彰公道事、竊職會所屬上海電力公司全體工友、在帝國主義壓迫之下、備受蹂躍、自去年六月以來、公司方面、迭次開除大批工友、並且將前工部局移交來之勞績金、拒絕給付、其壓迫工友實至斯極、此次公司當局、乘前開除之工友倪文富·潘根林·張才生·陳寳根·等四人、華董正在進行調解之際、以無佐證之懶惰爲藉口、又復開除工友戴仁恒薛阿寳·印炳根等三人、其蓄意破壞工運、至爲明顯、全體工友、忍無可忍、不得已忍痛怠工、惟因顧念電氣爲公用事業、關係社會秩序、至重且大、故仍維持發電、於促資方覺悟之中、寓維持社會秩序之意、惟公司當局、持其帝國主義勢力、態度蠻横、將來結果如何、尙難逆料、或因此而引起更嚴重之糾紛、則出項責任、當由公司負之、爲特備文、並推楊肇庚等四人前來、陳述實情、伏祈鈞局、迅採有效辦法、賜予核辦、實爲德便、謹呈市政府市黨部市社會局、</p>
<p>鍾思調停無效　電力工人曾於上星期六、向工部局總辦鍾思請願、當由鍾氏接見、允向電力公司磋商、囑於昨日、前往聽候答復、該工人等、昨晨仍推代表朱浩生·張長生·包德福·朱阿福·等前往、謁見會辦何德奎、當囑於下午前往、該代表等於下午四時半、又往聽候答復、當由會辦何德奎代表鍾思、向工人正式答復、略謂、鍾氏已向該公司當局磋商、但該公司態度頗爲堅持、仍無切實辦法、希望各工人卽日復工、以免糾紛擴大等語、該代表當返會、向各工人報告、</p>

<p>靖安售出　海部之三運艦中、以靖安最合商用、蓋普安輪客位雖多、而無貨艙行駛商班、殊不合算、今此船已與招商訂立租賃合同、續靑島航路、刻尙在修理中、靖安艦除客位外、更可裝貨一千餘噸、先經海軍部長陳紹寛與招商接洽、亦擬出租與該局行駛北洋、已由船務科副主任周厚坤赴京視察、旋因租價問題、未經議妥、而三北公司虞洽卿氏現爲發展近海航路計、特與陳部長接洽購買此靖安輪、討論結果、聞代價爲二十六萬元、已經兩方議妥、不久即將付欵交輪、按靖安艦有二千四进噸、内設頭·二·三·等客位、兼有貨艙、速度亦佳、</p>

<p>昨來第一批計田徑足藍球隊四十三人</p>
<p>第二批女籃球男女排球隊明日抵上海</p>
<p>女籃球錦標確有把握</p>
<p>福建省參加全運會選手團、第一批共計四十三人、搭招商濟南輪、昨日已抵上海、下榻大東旅社、第二批將於明日搭華安輪來此、五日晨偕同晋京、昨晚得晤該團總敎練陳掌諤等、記其談話如次、</p>
<p>選手團二批出發　昨日到滬爲第一批人計四十三人、爲男籃球隊足球網球及田徑遊泳選手、及總敎練陳掌諤、總幹事鄧世熙等、總領隊林蔭南於第二批中偕來、第二批爲女籃球選手、及男女排球隊、明日搭華安抵此、</p>
<p>林紹洲高欄出色　田徑選手中、以林紹洲最有把握、林爲上屆全運高欄冠軍、福建預選成績十六秒八、得之甚易、在全運中可更進步、其四十七米四五之標槍、則稍欠把握、因是日預選、順風中所得也、</p>
<p>陳興宇長跑有望　尙有長距離跑選手陳興宇、亦具有希望、此次預選成績八百米二分十二秒六、千五百米四分二十九秒、如無敵手、尙可進步、滬報誤載八百米爲二分三秒、千五百米四分二秒、實則發電差誤、惟陳君年少力强、此成績已甚佳矣</p>
<p>女籃球確有把握　據籃球指導楊緒實談、錦標確有把握者爲女子籃球、由集美代表出席、兩江征厦、以十七比三十三大敗、該隊南遊星洲等處、十七戰十七勝、中鋒陳榮棠前鋒薛正俠、確屬明星、後衛徐素鳳爲足球健將徐亞輝妹、亦堅强非凡、近益有前兩江黄淑華、故實力完美、惜乎全運秩序、第二週卽逢上海、不無掃興、男子似覺經騐稍差耳、</p>

<p>（四）就各縣情形比較、元年度最多爲武進之七七四人、最少爲揚中之四人、二十年度最多、爲無錫之一四三六人、最少爲揚中之三二人、</p>
<p>（五）二十個年度中、各縣敎師數、時有升降、試就十年度與元年度比較减少者、有吳江楊山兩縣二十年度與元年度比較减少者有上海太倉寳應三縣、</p>

<p>江蘇各縣籌備義務敎育聯合辦事處將各縣二十年來初級小學校數逐年比較、製成統計、茲摘錄其大要於下、</p>
<p>（一）元年度江蘇各縣初級小學總數四七一六校、五年度六一五七校、（元年加一四四一校）十年度七四○）校、（比元年增二六八五校比五年增一二四四校）十五年度六八六二校、（比五年增二一四六校比五年增七○五校、比十年减少五三九校）二十年度八三六○校、（比元年增三六四四校比五年增　二○三校比十年增九五九校、比十五年增一四九八校、比上年增四八校）、</p>
<p>（二）從元年度之四七一六校、增至二十年度之八三六○校、前後相較、計增三六四四校、卽一·七七倍、平均每年度增三五一校而强、</p>
<p>（三）就各年度、增校比較、十六年度所增之、一二二校爲最多、六年度較五年度所增之六校爲最少、彼此相差一一一六校、</p>
<p>（四）歷年學校總數　均有增加、但十五年較十四年反减少、一二一一校任何年度所增之學校數、均不及該年度所减少之數、蓋十五年度减少之學校數、恰當二十年來學校增加數三分之一、</p>
<p>各年度所增加之學校數、並非按年遞次增加且升降、頗不一致、茲從多到少按各該年度與上一年度比較排列、其順序如下、第一十七年度一一二二校第二四年度四六六校、第三三年度四○九校、第四十一年度三八○校、第五十年度三四五校、第六五年度三二二校、第七七年度三○六校、第八八年度三○四校、第九九年度二八三校、第十二年度二四三校、第十一十八年度二○二校、第十二十二年度一六八校、第十三十三年度一一五校、第十四十六年度九八校、第十五二十年度四八校、第十六十九年度二八校、第十七十四年度九校、第十八六年度六校、第十九十五年度减少一二一一校、</p>
<p>（六）觀蔡各年度所增加之學校數、可知七八九十十一各年度進步、最爲整齊、三四十七各年度突升、六十五各年度突降、十九年度以後、學校增數極少不及七八九等年度十分之一、故二十年來學校數之發展、實成一弧形、</p>
<p>（七）二十個年度中學校總數、除十五年度外、雖均有增加、但就各縣學校數、分别比較、則亦頗有升降、計五年度與元年度比較减少者、有江寗金壇溧陽金山太倉吳江武進宜興淮陰等九縣、十年度與五年度比較减少者、有高淳松江奉賢金山吳豐沛邳碭山等九縣、十五年度、較十年减少者、有江寗高淳鎭江溧陽上海松江奉賢寳山峻明海門吳常熟崑山吳江無錫靖江江都東台銅山豐沛蕭邳東海灌雲沐陽贛榆等二十七縣、二十年度與十五年度比較减少者、有嘉定崇明南通泰興江都高郵寳應銅山等八縣、又二十年度與元年度比較减少者、有江寗奉賢吳江上海寳應等五縣、</p>
<p>（八）二十年度中各縣學校數並無有增無减之縣、試以二十年度與十九年度比較减少最少者爲揚中等縣之一校、减少最多者、爲江寗溧陽上海（九）元年度學校數滿一百校者、爲江寗溧陽上海松江南匯靑浦崇明海門吳縣常熟吳江武進無錫宜興江陰南通如臯等十七縣、二十年度滿三百校者爲武進無錫江陰南通等四縣、滿二百校者、爲海門吳常熟宜興如臯南匯等六縣、其餘滿一百校者、爲句容鎭江丹陽溧陽松江靑浦太倉嘉定崇明崑山吳江泰興淮陰淮安漣水阜寗東台泰縣銅山豐沛碭山宿遷睢寗啟東等二十五縣、反之不滿百校者、有二十四縣、（元年度不滿百校者共四十三縣）</p>
<p>（十）二十年度中學校數最多者爲二十年度、武進之三八○校、最少係之年度揚中之二校、其次爲贛榆之五校、最多與最少相差三七八校、卽一九○倍、</p>
<p>（十）（一）各縣所增學校數之比例相差甚大、例如元年度與二十年度比較、增加最多者爲溧水、從三校至一七八校、卽增十八倍、最少爲金山從八六校、至八九校、其餘增加兩倍以上者、爲句容高淳江浦六合鎭江丹陽江陰南通如臯泰興靖江漣水鹽城阜寗興化泰縣銅山豐肅碭山宿遷睢寗東海灌雲沐陽贛榆等二十六縣、</p>

<h3 id="c216">反 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>「反」之一字，在以前君主時代是觸犯忌諱，應當遠而避之的。漢末孫英炎創「反切）。到了唐代，因「反」字觸目得很，遂避「反」用「翻」。這是一個很顯明的例子。相傳清季某公督學某省時，出了一個截搭題「王速出令反」！士論大譁，幾乎罷考。言官據以上聞，某公就此革職，永不叙用。據說某公所以閙此亂子，是因爲不信狐仙之故，狐仙遂請他吃了一個「反」字的大虧。本來從前科舉時代，有好多字在墨卷中應設法避免的，如「殺」，「逆」，「盜」等是；而「反」亦其中之一。　如說「撥亂反正」，意義原是很堂皇的，祗好把「反」改作「歸」。這因爲「反」之一字，是君上所厭闻的，臣下以及士庶人自不能不謹避。至於「亂」，雖亦觸目，大槪因爲吃過冷猪肉的朱熹，把它解作「亦治也」；所以「撥亂」依舊可以寫作「撥亂」，不必改成「撥治」。降及民國，此種奥規矩，自在廢除之列，於是「反正」，「反共」等字眼，報紙上，嘴巴裡也時常有得見到或聽得着了。然而獨個「反」字，還未便公然用之，乃以「危害國家」代。這本是一種盤馬彎弓的法子。雖多寫了四個字，可是較僅寫一個「反」字，似覺冠冕得多。今人弄筆頭的技巧，實可佩服。還有像什麽「反帝」，「反戰」等字眼，因爲不能照「撥亂歸正」例，避「反」用「歸」；所以也祇好由它。好得所謂「反帝」，「反戰」，不過說說寫寫，所　時髦。實則「反」其名而不「反」其實，自可大「反」而特「反」，又有什麽忌諱啊！</p>
<p>請讀者一想，假使我們生在君主時代，要這種時髦名詞，一出風頭；試問，「反」字可以何字代之？好不好用「歸」？卽此一端，可見我人生在今日，不能不說是「大有福氣」了。</p>
<h3 id="c217">官和財 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>我每次還鄕時，街坊鄰里總問得我呌若；說什麽「少爺幾時做官發財呢？」這様的問句，我的耳膜裏，雖然接觸得慣了，似乎已不覺得其意義的可怕，然而每次被這惡俗的問句襲擊時，總感到有些剌痛。剌痛之餘，我常常回答不出一句話來，只是傻笑着罷了；因爲我知道他們發問的動機是十二分地善意的。一方面固然如同說「天氣好」與「吃過飯了没有」的那種無聊應酬話一様，但他方面也含有懇摯地關注我客中的近况。當然，我該感謝他們的盛意的。不過話又說回來了，關於「做官發財」的問題，正十足表示中國舊社會的陳腐的傳統思想。從前做父母的都希望兒子念了四書五經，考中功名做官，所以一個人從胎生到逝世，天天所接觸的只是「官」味兒。譬如江南一帶男孩子的小名，總是取個「×官；」甚至苦得連飯也没有吃的人家的孩子，終向没有機會讀書，更没有機會去考科舉，當然没有機會去做「官」，然而取個「官」名也是好的，眞是不可解的笑話；而笑話還不止此。從前人因爲希望兒子做「官」所以還希望兒子「衣錦榮歸」，說是「以光門楣」。就是街坊鄰里，也希望别人家的兒子中狀元做宰相，說是「以光鄕里」。從這點上，可見中國人鄕土觀念之重。在裨官野史和民間故事中都是千篇一律的「落難公子中狀元」而滿讚其「衣錦榮歸」的盛况。</p>
<p>除做「官」以外，發「財」也是人人歡喜的。舊歷元旦開門第一句向人拱拱手而所說的話，便是「恭喜發財」。在各地到處所看到的是財神廟，正月年初四總有許多善男信女虔誠地去膜拜。如此這殷，又可見中國人的希望發「財」，也不亞於希望做「官」。而中國人又有種「格言」，做「官」就可發「財」。</p>
<p>中國人太崇拜「官」和「財」，鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已。我希望這種傳統思想要轉變才好！</p>

<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>來毫厘無差，二乾五坤成家，一時打得亂如麻，直到清明方罷」，這是前人咏算盤的詞句，在這新潮流澎湃的年頭裏，凡百事物都趨向維新，廢棄舊制，萬想不到區區的一把算盤，却能夠如中流砥柱，巍然獨存！算盤亦足以自豪了！</p>
<p>小子務服於商店帪務處，對於算盤，大有「不可一日無此君」之槪，雖說現在筆算也很盛行，但在商家買賣進出之際，大半還是依舊使用算盤，因爲筆算總不能及它的敏捷便利，所以連外人開設的以司，洋行，也不能省它，算盤的使用起來，不像筆算得有小數點，來分别零數整數，那全仗撥珠前的記憶定位，普通人算簡單的「乘」或「除」，很少研究於此，但是多位的「乘」或「除」，若非算前切記着「定位訣，」就很容易　錯的！算盤的式様，都是每擋七粒算珠，上二下五，從前會稽人壽孝天君，曾發明種算盤，每擋雖仍是七粒算珠，却是上三下四的，稱它爲壽式算盤，但是後來不能普及，所以市上仍照舊式。</p>
<p>用算盤來作比喻的也很多，如：性質呆鈍不活動的人，人家就咒他像算盤撥撥動動，你若是只顧一想情願，打算不可必得的進益，人家又喚他「如意算盤」了，若說它的游戲，也有幾種，如；走算盤棋，五虎下西川，獅子滾繡球等。最可噱的，就是算盤上也含有迷信觀念，請你到處去瞧，從没有擋子成雙的，因爲算盤是商家使用時候爲多，商家終年碌碌，無非爲操奇計贏，利博蠅頭爲主，商人用「盈虧進出」四字，在算盤擋上逐支數去，　至最後的一支，定是非「贏」即「進」，無論它是九擋，十一擋，十三擋，十五擋的算盤，都是如此，這已可推測他們心理的一斑了。</p>

<p>— 東海波臣</p>
<p>趙子明君曾先後介紹「王師爺」和「五夫人」，我不以效顰之譏，來介紹「王小姐」。</p>
<p>說起來，王小姐雖不是生在侯門之家，然而却因爲上無兄姊，下無弟妹，所以王師爺夫婦竟如寳貝般看待，愛護備至起來。</p>
<p>伊的一副面孔，也端的生得可愛；那吹彈得破的臉兒，那微笑的渦兒，何况那種「熱」的舉動，一些戀愛主義的信徒，眞如「蚊子見血」般的追逐個不住。不消說得，王小姐的裝飾，是不需自己去買的，幾個知友，自然爭着博伊的歡心，伊抱着「開放門户」主義，如「旣來之，則安之」的宗旨，伊的愛人竟有六打之數，這可不能不驚佩伊手段的高妙了。據說却因此早就失去了處女貞操了。</p>
<p>伊是喜歡常在交際會上活躍的，雖然伊不能寫字，也不能演說幾句，就只爲了一張臉，就被稱交際之花，這可見社會上重視伊的一斑。</p>
<p>在十九歲那一年上，伊被一位下野將軍愛上了，就此金屋藏嬌，不到一年，有了結晶品，生活的愉快，是無以復加了。但伊却别有懷抱，和那位下野將軍鬧着離婚。結果一方面因爲名譽有關，忍痛拿出十萬元瞻養費，現在伊已自由自在得多了。</p>

<p>美國　爲者雷那耳史博士曾於加利福尼亞省其監獄諸罪犯間作關於内分泌腺與犯罪行爲有何關係的研究，就其檢騐結果，極大部份的罪犯内分泌腺俱非正常，此數百腺病患者，因其腺機能障礙的異同，約可分三組：甲狀腺病類，腦下垂體病類與靑春泉病類（甲狀腺在喉頭部腦下垂體在腦部靑春腺爲罩丸與卵巢）。第一類大多屬神經質感情極易衝動，精神狀態頗不平穏。其中百分之七十以上都曾有過暴行，卽係因傷人，擊斃人，行刺，及謀財害命等行爲而犯罪者。此中有五人最倔强，甚難對付，時對同獄的罪犯施行野蠻的襲擊。以是請醫生加以診治。及患病之甲狀腺施行手續後，其病態及品行俱有顯著的改善。第二類則多屬善良可親的人，惟缺乏責任心與奮鬥心，其中百分之八十以上都係因欺詐，假冒，侵呑或私用公欵及行竊等罪而被罰者，但可注意的事是，其中絕無殘暴的犯罪行爲。經用内泌素治療，雖未受敎育的薰陶，而其人格已大見改善，對人對事態度俱漸見嚴　，同時對於本身所負對社會對人類的責任亦開始了解。第三類大多是，謹愼，靜默，守分的人，普通對於自己的感情與情慾都能善自節制，但有時畢竟會不可壓抑地特發性地爆發出來。其所犯都屬出人意外的妨礙風化罪。經用内泌素療治後，身體與心理的狀態俱有明顯的改進。據雷那耳史博士的意見，一個人的犯罪，一方面固由於其他經濟等條件的誘發，而最要的因素乃爲精神作用的越出常態，至所以致此，則與身體狀况，仔細的說，與物質新陳代謝的生物化學作用有關，而這則固定全受内分泌腺之主要影響。故他深信，普通行爲反常的犯罪者俱可因腺分泌作用的均衡化而完全變爲正常的人。現關於這方面的研究雖猶未能認爲定論，但其一部分的眞實性是無可疑義的，故現世界的刑律學者對此已引起其大的注意。將來也許有一天人類的法律會有一個根本的改造，一切斬决，絞首，槍斃等非人道的刑罪俱將加以廢除，犯罪者不須要進監獄，只須進醫院；而且用醫術的昌明，一切不合理的犯罪行爲俱可以預先防止。</p>

<p>— 希農</p>
<p>一般人往往說：「人雖瘦，筋骨却好。」這一句話，科學已證明宅是具有十分的眞理的。以前，享德海特在他的「新營養學」一書中曾有一個統計，在十萬人中，瘦者，肥者與不瘦不肥的死亡率的比例是：一○○比一五八比一五四。最近，柏林大學敎授克史卡脱曾關於這「肥不如瘦」的問題用動物。作了一次實地的研究。他先是以牛乳白麵包等滋養物混合喂着數十隻白鼠，而後將其中瘦的與肥的分開，使各受有毒的細菌的攻擊，結果，兩者的死亡率，肥者高出瘦者多多。同様，酒精中毒亦有相似的情形，故由此觀之，吾人可以斷定：肥不如瘦！</p>

<p>美金是否將起變化傳說紛紜</p>
<p>金市昨形勢徘徊、後市潛勢較堅、晨初以英美銀價微升、滙兌則升降俱有、五金交易遠期銀價漲二厘半至五厘半不等、倫敦生金長一便士、美新礦金升一角三、爲三十一元四角六、美棉長四磅音、美麥勿動、遠期略賤、股票漲跌咸微、毛盤開出略漲、蓋報載有人詢問美政府金元是否將重定價值、僅指出一星期前、所發關於膨脹通貨、現無新發展之聲明、以相答之訊、較爲有利也、開後以中央匯兑局力　美匯、雖升而仍挫、滙豐掛牌英平而美長一二五、中央銀行亦來供給、滙市硬化而跌、但最後仍能轉穏、逐漸回漲、後市竟穿出八十元關、人心頗振、旋以銀行趁貴供給、而仍退至七十元内、成盤旋之象、市况平庸、西商賣意頗殷、乃預期美金必減低成色也、烚赤價一千一百十元、今將一天市况誌後、</p>

<p>本年全國棉產、在第一次估計時、大體均屬良好、頗有豐稔期望、惟有數省苦旱、彼時估計十一省產棉額爲一千○七十三萬四千四百五十一担、平均每畝產皮棉二十七斤强、如旱區及時得兩、平均每畝收量頗有達三十斤之可能、詎第一次估計後、旱區得兩稍　、棉作發育已受影響、雖入秋天氣晴朗、要亦不過勉能扯平、此外魯省河水成災、曹區被淹、豫中旱患未解、陜省漢水泛溢、亦告减收、最後蘇浙兩省又遭九月間兩度風雨、損失頗巨、故雖湖北河北微增、而平均狀况、則已微形退步矣、</p>
<p>綜計此次十一省棉田共計三千九百六十八萬四千三百六十九畝、較第一次增五十二萬六千九百二十三畝、因本年第一次調查較早、六月遲種區域、下種尚未畢事、故本次棉田增多、如益以廢田數、則本年下種棉田達四千○二十五萬九千四百六十畝、爲十年來最高之數字、棉產額共計九百八十三萬八千二百八十六担、較本年第一次估計减少八十九萬六千一百六十五担、比較二十一年實收則增一百七十三萬二千六百四十九担、仍爲最近十年間之最多產額、平均每畝收量第一次估計時爲二七·二斤、此次已降爲二四·八斤、减少二·四斤、尙有第三次估計、將於十二月十五日發表、</p>

<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>要是我的性格再强些，我可以在上海住下去；雖然無拳　勇，就拚一個天靈蓋去抵擋狼牙棒。要是我的性格再弱些，我會在目前的濤聲凄厲的月夜跳下海去；在這様的世界活不下去的人不止我一個。</p>
<p>不幸的是，我的性格却介乎强與弱之間，我不能拚命戰鬥，我　不能拚命自盡。那末，我祗好走了！</p>
<p>到那裏去呢？</p>
<p>入山必深，入林必密，我不能；與怪物爲伍，究竟也是非非之想。我要生活，我還須住在人羣中間。我不遇離開了上海的人羣，住到另一人羣中去罷了。在另一人羣中，羅網還不曾這様密，死路還没有這様多。我還能找到一塊餘地，理理我的本行：生些火，鍊些鐵。雖然危機也是四伏着，但没有上海那麽的急迫。有着像我們的性格的人，是只能這様地苟全性命了。倘連那地方也不能苟全性命時，我也許會不再愛我的性命。然而，現在，我是挾着性命從上海逃出來了。</p>
<p>上海，你這魔鬼蟠踞着的上海，我離開你了。</p>
<p>「我又南行矣。笑今年鸞飄鳳泊，情懷何似－縱使文章驚海内，紙上蒼　而已：似春水干卿何事？暮雨忽來鴻雁杳，莽關山一派秋聲裏，催客去，去如水……」</p>
<p>又是定　的句子。爲什麽他的話會常常感動我？但我怎想比得上他？在文化界做一個打雜的「墮民」，怎麽會有驚人的文章？雖說現在的文壇上不少「略工感慨即名家」的作者，但我何敢希冀！「紙上蒼和」，對於社會，眞是毫不相干，對於自己倒會惹上殺身之禍。把心力性命這様地妄用，實在太不值得了。我還是去罷！</p>
<p>别了，你這魔鬼蟠踞着的上海。我到另一人羣中間去了。但我没有這様的妄：「願得黄金三百萬，交盡美人名士，更結盡燕邯俠子一，我只想到供奉稻麥布帛的人們中間，去理理我的本行；生些火，鍊些鐵。</p>
<h3 id="c246">佛敎社會主義 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>基督敎社會主義已經有人講過了，我想講一講佛敎社會主義，可是我於佛經無緣，說不出什麽佛法大道理，偶然翻讀元曲無名氏來生債，就根據這一本雜劇來說罷。</p>
<p>來生債演唐襄陽龐藴棄財成佛事。却說李孝先借龐居士兩個銀子經商，本利該還四個銀子，不幸折本，無錢償還。一日，他往縣衙門首經過，見衙門裏門綳扒吊拷的十多人，都是因爲欠少那財主的錢物纔受這種苦刑的，不覺驚憂成病。龐居士探知病由，因念平日濟人之急，本爲做善事來，誰想倒做了冤業？當面把孝先的借券燒了，並贈給他兩個銀子。龐居士回到家來，就將那遠年近歲借與人錢的文書燒掉。不想烟燄衝天，驚動了上界增福神，化做秀士，託名曾信實，下凡探問居士。兩個人暢論錢的用處，居士以爲金錢萬惡，約以後會而别。晚上，居士到宅前院後燒香，眼見磨博士羅和打鑼驅牛之苦，呌他停止勞動，並給他一個銀子謀生。磨博士得銀，終夜不能安睡，仍把銀子還來。居士又曾因晚上燒香到後槽門首，聽見驢子馬牛都作人聲。驢子云：「馬哥，你當初爲甚麽來？」馬云：「我當初少龐居士十五兩銀子，無的還他，我死之後變做馬塡還他。驢哥，你可爲甚麽來？」驢子云：「我當初少龐居士的十兩銀子，無錢還他，死後變做個驢兒與他拽磨。牛哥，你可爲甚麽來？」牛云：「你不知道，我在生之時，借了龐居士銀子十兩，本利該二十兩，不曾還他，我如今變一隻牛來塡還他。」龐居士聽了，不覺失驚道：「嗨！兀的不諕殺我也！我當初本做善事來，誰想弄巧成拙，兀的不都放做來生債也！」於是他呌家人都來，告訴了他聽得牛馬畜生的話。他把家私總曆文書都燒了。家中奴僕每人與他一，從良文書，遣發回家。牛羊驢騾馬匹，都送鹿門山放生。一切金銀寳貝，玉器玩好，都沈於東海。全家入鹿門山，研竹子，編笊籬爲生。最後，全家證果成佛。</p>
<p>這一劇包含高利貸，雇工待遇，牲畜待遇，金錢廢止，奴隷解放，勞動神聖等問題，中心思想乃在對於財產私有制度的攻擊。但作者找不到正當解决的途徑，而歸結於佛家因果輪廻之說，希望剝削階級放下屠刀，這種幻想的佛家社會主義，在現代有正確思想的人看來，自然是可笑的。而且劇中以爲被地主債主剝削而無力担受的貧苦階級，死了還要變牛變馬來塡還，這更是不可饒恕的鬼話。</p>
<h3 id="c247">魔窟－靑島印象之三 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>在湛山的一面，樹林掩護着四個巨大的砲台，它們並列着，石龜般伸長了頸項，口子正對着前面水天相接，雲山蒼茫的海灣。</p>
<p>這砲台是德意志帝國佔領膠澳時建築下來的。靑島由德國人手裏轉到日本人手裡，再從日本人的手裡「接收」回來，歷刦滄桑，剩留下這慘痛的歷史的遺蹟。</p>
<p>如今砲台是成了廢物了，裡面却還可以進去。入口在山坡的面而，那兒有一扇斑駁的鐵門，靑苔與蔓籐爬得滿壁。</p>
<p>裡面恰像是一個恐怖的魔窟！</p>
<p>那兒有無邊的黑暗，陰森森的空氣裡散播着刺鼻的氣息。脚底下潮濕而且滑膩，踏下去會使你渾身的毛髮都寒瑟瑟地竪立起來。看守砲台的孩子在前面引導着，手裡拿一支燃着的洋燭，向一條狹長的小衖裡幽幽地前進。你眼睛所接觸的是：顫着的燭火，一圈昏黄的光，光圈裡的孩子的頭，灰頽的墻壁；除了這些便一無所有。這時候你心裡如果有什麽感觸，那准是想起了童話當中所描寫的魔窟的情景。</p>
<p>可是擺在眼前的却又並不是什麽巉岩亂石的山穴，那裡面也没有巨人與精靈的住宅－瑰奇典矞的神秘宮殿。</p>
<p>那是我們所常見的近代的建築，白石與鋼鐵構成的殺人的器械。地下有運車的鐡道，一直通到外面；頂上有運砲彈的鋼軌。裡面除了裝置砲位的處所，還有許多小小的房間：這兒是裝發電機的，那兒是給砲兵休息的；這兒是造飯的廚房，銹爛的大鐵鍋裡滿滿的泥塊，據說還是牛肉；那兒是傷兵休養室，在燈影糢糊中，引路的孩子指着墻上的斑點：「這是傷兵的血痕」。</p>
<p>從這此地方，你可以想象到若干年前，那些年靑的德意志兵士如何蟄伏窄窖中，撥動大砲的機械，轟然向敵人開發，從容不追地做殺人的勾當。</p>
<p>可是他們也不是殺人的惡魔。他們是受了鐵血主義的愚弄的靑年，他們殺死了多少和自己同様的異族的兄弟，結果自己也做了異國的游魂。那壁間斑斑的許就是他們　悔的血淚。</p>
<p>那地方有一里多長，另一邊也是一　銹爛的鐵門。從那裡出去，你才重見了朗朗的天日。這様巨大的工程，聽說從前造成時，靑島的中國居民竟没一個知道；一直到德兵退出，才發見這毁壞了的砲台。可憐中國的老百姓，常常是在做夢似的境地被殺的。</p>
<h3 id="c248">袁中郎做官（續） <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>他把自己稱做「奔走之令」（與管寗初），甚至說，「抱牘之苦，甚於抱病：簿領之趣，惡於藥餌」（與皇甫二泉），而認爲「自領吳令來，如披千重鐵甲，」祗有「無官一身輕」（與襲惟長。」官生活，在他的結論，檢直是「在官一日，一日活地獄也」（與羅隠南），官乎哉，「苦行頭陀」（與王百榖）而已矣！所以，「有父老具呈者，」他「便書紙尾」（與劉子感）說：</p>
<p>鄕遙心懶，忍作宦游之人；</p>
<p>食少事煩，恐是長眠之客！</p>
<p>中郎對於做官所感受的苦惱如何，於此可以想見了。不過，事實上，他還有一重苦惱，那就是他本是一個閒散的狂放不覊的人，你呌他鎭日從事這様忙碌的卑劣的生活，使他與過去的生活完全絕緣，不免使他有些難受。他給「蘭澤云澤叔」的信裏，曾經說到這件事：</p>
<p>金　自繁華，令自苦耳。何也？　船筆鼓，歌童舞女，此自豪客之事，非令事也。奇花異草，危石孤岑，此自幽人之觀，非令觀也。酒壇詩社，朱門紫陌，振衣莫厘之峰，灌足虎邱之石，此自游客之樂，非令樂也。令所對者，鶉衣百結之糧長，簧口利舌之刁民，及蟣虱滿身之囚徒耳。</p>
<p>一個狂放不羈的人，因爲做官便不能做「豪客，」做「幽人」做「游客，」他怎能不憤憤求去呢？此中郎寫信給湯義仍所以要說如次的話也：</p>
<p>人生幾日耳，長林豐草，何所不適？而自苦若是。每看陶潛，非不欲官者，非不醜貧者，但欲官之心，不勝其好適之心，醜貧之心，不勝其厭勞之心，故竟歸去來兮寗乞食而不悔耳。爲什麽中郎不願做官呢？這也就是其間原因之一了，「官累人，遠不如閒散之可以適志也」（與陶石簣」。要了解中郎的志趣在這封信裏是可以看到全般了。一種不適宜於他的生活，硬逼着要他做，呌他怎能不「積勞成疾，」憤憤辭官呢？昔讀明末殉國的吳麟徴家書，有云，「雖空懷直腸人亦見諒，然每中夜起思，非仕路人也，」若中郎者，即就他的性情一方面看，也不是「仕路中人」啊！</p>

<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>這様我們就隔着一張方桌對面地坐着，什麽話也不講，兩個人的心裏，個個想着不同的事；她一定是在奇怪着這個可笑的男人，用金錢招了一個任你怎様都不會拒絕的女子來，可又這般地斯文；同時我却在想，雖然是金錢的力使我們相聚在一起，－她爲獲得幾塊錢就犧牲她一夜的肉體，我化費幾塊錢就放縱我一夜的淫慾，但對於我，這事好像絕不是這麽簡單。」你呌我來，怎麽不說話呢？」最後她再也不能忍耐似地說出像是這様的話來。「我不會講你們的話呀！」我還是愉快地這様回答她。</p>
<p>我知道這個女子也是不理解我的話語的，雖然當我問她：「你懂得我的話麽？」她回答：「我懂得的，我也會講普通話。」但就是她的普通話，我也照様不能夠理解。</p>
<p>「你莫非不「中意」我麽？他雖然是微笑着這麽說，可是在她的笑裏是露着可憐的様子。「不是的，絕對不是的！」爲了使她安心，我不能不這様地回答了。</p>
<p>可是其次又不知道怎様講了，仍然好久繼續着沉默。她不安地摸着她帶來的那個錢包，望望地，望望墻，望望天花板，她好像不能理解到底她是作什麽來的了。</p>
<p>我很理解這時在她那慣於忍受着痛苦的小小的心靈裏，是禁受了怎様的難堪，因爲如果你爽快回答她「我不中意你」，她會媚笑着撲到你的身上，想法使你中意她的；可是，現在，這汚濁的小房間的沈悶的空氣，和那雖然對她微笑着而實際上是毫無温情的面孔，使她就不知道怎様對付，她的一切的手叚都無從使用了。這對於她簡直是比什麽都更厲害的，一種侮辱。</p>
<p>她這心境我雖然十分理解，可是我也想不出什麽話來說，一半固然是因爲言語的不通，而一半也是因爲在這様的環境裏，我實在不明白究竟該講些什麽様的話才好。苦思了許久，我才說出這麽一句話來：</p>
<p>「你去床上睡一睡吧？」我一面說着，一面用手勢帮助我的話語，使她理解我的話意。她輕蔑地笑了，顯然她是誤解了我的意思，可是我也不想辯白。因爲在這種環境裏，我早已經成了她的奴隷，如能夠使她减却了心靈上的不安，我便無上地快慰了。所以我還是仰着微笑的面孔，看她解她的紐扣。在她的白色的綢旗袍裏，是襯着一件淡紅色的内衣，兩個小小的奶頭，微微地　在裏面。那壓仰在我的胸裡的性慾的火熖又是像在燃燒着了。</p>
<p>「轉過臉去，不要看哟！」她故意嬌羞地說出這様的話語。但這話語裏是帶着不少的誘惑，我的心臟激烈地跳動着。</p>
<p>出她意料之外，我眞地垂下頭來，拿起手邊，支筆，就在紙上亂寫。當她脱了她的衣服，用被捲住了她的身體的時候，我聽見她像發　似地呌了一聲「傻仔」！</p>

<p>談言　文炳</p>
<p>在農村經濟枯萎都會市况蕭條的雙重尖鋭化的現在，與此息息相關的職業，也早已相隨成了絕大的問題，多少人連年在職業的圈子外兜轉，終是無職可謀，無業可就，形成流浪飢餓的大衆失業的恐慌，這還有什麽職業可談呢？不過　實上究竟有不少的人得着了職業的勝利，而且這確是人生的一個最大的問题　誰都應有一番認識與了解，所以有一談的價值。</p>
<p>職業二字的解義，翻開字典來看是這様：「本分以内所應當做的事業」，意義似太模糊。曾記得聽過江恒源氏一次職業方面的演講，他的解釋大致如此；「職即責任，業即業務，以責任心去做事業，就呌職業，其行程是利己利人，以完成人類的天職。」這種就字面的釋義，也還不能使我們滿意。就經濟學的眼光來說，所謂職業原不過在某種一定的方式下，以謀獲生活資料所發生的行爲，這様說來，某對象僅僅是經濟，意義也未免太狹隘了。我們以爲職業的解釋應該是人類的一種必然與必需的生活活動，其行程爲解决生活，促進人類社會。</p>
<p>這裏需要略微　述一番人類的意義：一是生，一是怎様才能生，因爲要生，就需要衣食住的供養，因爲要衣食住的供養，就需要生活的活動，也就是需要從自己的勞動上去尋求生之所需。時至今日，固然有不少的人，憑藉私有制度，社會勢力，不活動也能優裕的生活。但這顯然是人類意義的歪曲，病態的社會現象，其崩坍是必然在不久的將來就會到臨的，所以歸根一句還是人類應該有生活活動，也就是人類應該有職業。</p>
<p>因爲職業對人生的意義是這様的重要，其相互關係也就最爲密切。我們知道旣是職業，必有着長久性，而且是每日每日的如影隨形般的緊挨着生活前進，所以在就業之始，務要熟思審愼，一須顧及自己的興趣，二要看才力之配稱與否，三要看對於一般的社會貢獻怎様，這是最低的三個基本條件。一個頭腦科學化，其興趣十分接近工業職業的人，却去充當一種文學雜誌的編輯，其結果必然是自己感到興趣索然，事無成效。一個初中畢業生，呌他去當小學校長；也是才力所不稱。如果有製販紅丸鴉片賭具的機關有職業給你，即是優差，也不應貿然去就，因爲是違悖了第三個條件，不但没有一般的社會貢獻，簡直是危害社會與人類大衆的罪藪，可說不是職業。</p>
<p>所以就業之始，務要嚴加審愼，合乎條件謀得之職業，必然是人才適當職業，職業適當人才，那就應「敬業」「樂業」「恒業」。事實上果能如此分配，也就會無業的都有業，有業的都樂業，大家都會爲個人爲社會大衆而努力。</p>
<p>不過現社會是太矛盾了，有許多没有生活憑藉而要飯吃的人，往往無事可做，同時有錢的人，往往吃飯不做事，能做事願做事的人，往往無事給他做，不能做事的人，却往往佔了能做事的人的地位，拿大錢，吃好飯。歸根一句現在要圖謀職業，眞是困難極了，除了有拍馬吹牛的素養，而又有勢力做後盾，</p>
<p>社會是這様，恕我也不便多說了。我所希望的是已有職業的與正在謀職業而有把握的朋友，都應澈底的認清職業的要義及其重要，不要漫意輕忽。</p>
<h3 id="c250">給一個死去了的朋友　賓符 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>我的朋友是一個平常的人，但「死」卻是一件不平常的事，－－至少我們這些平常的人們以爲是不平常的，－－不平常的事竟然也降到我的那個平常的人身上了，我不能無感，我哭了。</p>
<p>在這個年頭兒，不平常的人的遭到不平常的死，是極平常的事。然而，像你這様平常的人，竟也那麽輕易的死了，我簡直不能相信！</p>
<p>當我得到你的死訊的時候，「死訊」實在没有法子使我相信。我冒昩地打了一個電話給我所不認識的你父親，知道你父親恰從漢口回到上海，就要回鄕來殮你，纔證明你是確實給死神抓去了。在這生疏的二個人的通話中，你父親是悲哀地哭了，哭得使我聽不出話，使我再也聽不下去，我便掛住了話筒。</p>
<p>你和我有六年的摯切友誼，你的死，不消說是我深切的創痛，然而我的悲哀，比起你父親的痛哭，你母親的傷心，你八旬祖母的悲悼，以及你新婚夫人的披髮抓臉的呌喊狂號，眞是算得甚麽！眞是算得甚麽！</p>
<p>像你這様於世無違，於人無忤的老實人，我想你對於「死」也不會有怎様的怨恨的。誠如希臘路吉亞諾思所說：「……飢渴寒冷現在已没有你的份了！你是去了，去到疾病的權力以外，……戀愛不能再來擾亂你的平安，損害你的健康，侵略你的錢袋了，……你也不會再到那可厭的老年，也不會再做你後輩的眼中釘了！……」死也許對於你是一種愛悦。</p>
<p>倒是你祖母父母以及妻子的哀慟，是你唯一所水安的事，然而我們又怎能遏止他們的悲切呢！</p>
<p>我體騐不到人生究有那一點好處，我想像不到「陰間」究有那一點缺陷，仔</p>
<p>細想來，我也没有替你此去怎様傷心！</p>

<p>「死烏龜呀！路倒屍呀……這錢是你女人雪白的身體……痛……」老闆娘還呶呶地駡個不休。壁角里的他，聽了外面許多人在冷言冷語，她又不斷地自出其醜，於是　羞成怒地臉上一紅一白，眉毛一竪，牙關一緊，思想上去打她一頓，但又忽然想起，三年前自己赤手空拳到上海來，多麽窮困！若非妻的能幹，搭上了張老頭兒，怎能有今日之下，這臭皮囊也早埋白楊荒草間了，還有福份來做大都市里的老闆？况且妻現在手頭有到二三萬，看在錢的面上，只好媽媽虎虎吧！面子，不要緊，反正現在是「只奉衣衫不奉人」。於是他的身子，又軟了下去，預備打她的手，也不由自主地縮回來了，臉上熱辣辣地，頭里烏昏昏地，仍舊在壁角里一動都勿動。「嗚嗚嗚」雪亮耀目的一輛汽車，到了××烟紙店門口，停了，車門啓處，一位嘴含雪加，八字鬚，紳士式的老頭兒，踏了進來。怒容滿臉，殺氣騰騰的老闆娘，霎時間軟綿綿地笑容可掬的，嘻嘻地迎了上去，和老頭兒携手同行。一幕醜劇也突然地告終了。</p>
<h3 id="c252">「極平常的事」　之 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>從夜校裏敎了兩個鐘頭的書，衣袋裏裝着剛才拿到手的今天的薪水，一塊四毛錢，心頭不知是喜哀，是欣慰是愁苦地，把疲乏的身子笨重地移動到南京路公共汽車的站頭，就在這站頭，我遇着一件好些人都說是「極平常的事」。－眞的，這事是再「平常」而且還是簡單不過的。</p>
<p>一家電炬輝煌的火腿店的大門前，圍着一大堆人。在人的核心裏，我發現了四個能夠給我注意的人：一個是氣還在喘着而汗濕透敞開了胸襟的短衫的黄包車夫，在他的烏黑粗燥的手掌上托着「八只角子」様子怪難看的，似乎在他的心頭充滿着一腔的委屈和不可遏的怒氣；兩個是雄糾糾着藍制服執警棍的「先生；」還有一個是紳士模様穿得很齊整的靑年店員，他在指手劃脚，然而是和顔悦色，輕言細語地向我們的「先生」數說着他的理由。我們的「先生」就交义着放在他們胸前的手膀，安閒地像法官審犯人地一面聽着，一面問着。</p>
<p>「從這兒拉到福開森路，有多少點遠？講好五毛錢；拖到那兒，因爲没找到目的地，所以就呌他把我拖回，我加了他三毛錢，我冤枉白跑一趟，一共給他八毛錢，請問先生，該没有虧他吧？」</p>
<p>「這是你的道理嗎？不管，從六點半拉到現在，來去差不多三個鐘頭，跑了幾十里的路，夜飯還没下肚啦！」顫拦而實在是憤怒的聲音，就從這位倔强的勞働者的喉頭裏像冒靑烟的吐出來。接着，我們的「先生）向他的審問，是冷冷的，短短的：</p>
<p>「那麽，依你該要多少呢？」</p>
<p>「依理，至少也該要十毛錢。」</p>
<p>「加他二十個子兒吧。」</p>
<p>紳士模様的靑年店員臉上浮着勝利的微笑，遵從「先生」的判决，數了二十個銅子兒給車夫；然而車夫還在理直氣壯地爭執着不答應。於是</p>
<p>「猪玀！不識抬舉的東西！老子帮你忙，你一些不識相？滾！」警棍也就像密雨點地打在車的篷架上。於是車夫拖着車子狼狽的逃避了。</p>
<p>接着，就是這些看熱閙的紛紛的議論：</p>
<p>「這種傢伙，眞不必向他好說話的：給了他些顔色，他就要開染坊。小人總是小人胚子！」</p>
<p>「有規矩的，黄包車三只角子一點鐘。」</p>
<p>「開頭說話不要凶，好好地和善些要人家加錢，人家總情願加的。」</p>
<p>「…………………」</p>
<p>移了上去，我就被擠　一個角落裏。「三只角子一點鐘），「想加錢就得要和善地說好話」我重複地諗着。</p>

<p>這是一個晚秋的午後，招寳山的脚下，祇餘剩些亂石和衰草，淡薄的夕陽，正斜照着無語的鍾山。一陣一陣的雁兒互相呌喚着，都飛落在蘆叢裏；一羣羣的烏鴉亂噪着，向南飛去；天上有一絲浮雲，純淨的藍天，除了飛鳴的雁陣和鴉羣以外，竟毫無點綴；嚴緊的風吹拂着山上山下的衰草，似乎奏着一種蕭瑟的音樂；抬頭看見黄色烟囱的輪船在向前直進，徐徐地快要駛出口子子，她－－她就是我的母親啊！－－在船中不知怎様地在思慮着她唯一的愛兒！一星期許的光陰，竟如此迅速的過去，現在母親又是别了我　遠遠地漂泊在四望無際的洋海裏，我是個無依的孤兒，父親已歸黄土，安寗地長睡在沙蟹嶺之頂上，即使我狠命地，悲切地呼着「爸脃！」他終是置之不理，他與我已是幽明異路後會無期，現在母親又遠去了；烟囱裏的烟是遠離遠離終久是隠没了，不見了！啊！我的心中何等難堪！我的母親給那無情殘酷的船兒帶去了。這可惡的可咒咀的船兒啊，你不太殘酷了碼？</p>
<p>母親在不上船時所叮囑我的話，現在重又清晰地回嚼起來，覺得每字每句都是含着偉大的慈愛，這様充滿着慈愛的話兒，在世上决没有第二個人所能說出來的！那時我覺得我的一生不能脱離了她的慈愛而生活。於是我徘徊在山脚下的小路上，凝視着穹形的碧落及茫茫的大海，然而我對於大自然的一切都是</p>
<p>没精打彩，在我的眼前祇有母親的面影，很顯明地映現着，天空裏又飛過一陣雁兒，一片嘹唳之聲，頓時便將四週的寂寞衝破，在秋意蕭然的傍晚，聽了長空的幾聲嘹唳，更使的惆悵而徬徨，眼望着四圍灰黄慘淡寂寞無人的山崖，心上感發了一種深刻，沉悶，漫無邊際，不可名言的苦悶！夕陽已完全沈落下去了，西方所餘剩的紅光，還斜照着大地，山上已由浮紫色而變爲濃灰色；嚴緊的風，更加使勁的吹着，使我不驚而慄！</p>

<p>大家走進敎室，每個同學的視綫，先集中在前面黑板上的幾行粉筆字，什麽「新孟子」，什麽「洋房我所欲也，美女亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼，舍洋房而取美女也」。</p>

<p>陳先生走上敎台，開始說，「這課是授應用文」，說完，也就拿着粉筆照着他帶來的敎授書，在黑板上抄着公司組織法，一定名，二宗旨等等條例；和公文程式，爲呈請事……懇祈鑒核施行等等式様。</p>

<p>Ji's Youth Army Flees to Yongning</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Circle Over Changping</p>
<p>And Bomb Guanjiaying</p>
<p>(Beiping) Traffic between Beiping and Miyun has resumed today. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News, Changping Dispatch: This morning, a Japanese plane came to Changping for reconnaissance, circling back and forth for about several tens of minutes before flying east. It also dropped four bombs at Guanjiaying, a place more than ten li east of Changping. The extent of the damage is currently under investigation. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News, Changping Dispatch: Fang Ji's remnants are still entrenched in the mountainous area around Shalingliang, and they have joined forces with Wang Ying, Zhan Tao, and other bandit troops, totaling about four to five thousand people. Only half of them have firearms. They are conscripting firearms, provisions, carts, and horses from the local area, causing great distress to the people. According to a report from the head of the Mingling Police Sub-station to the county, several dozen of Fang's troops suddenly returned to the imperial tombs before dawn this morning, claiming that the majority would arrive soon. Due to being outnumbered, they returned to the county to request instructions on how to proceed. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huairou Dispatch: Liu Chongren, the magistrate of Huairou County, and Li Zhi, the head of the Public Security Bureau, were both appointed by Fang without authorization. Xu Wenquan, the county magistrate appointed by the Hebei Provincial Government, was kidnapped by Fang, but suddenly returned on foot this afternoon from Jiudahe Village on the Changping border. He immediately went to Zhoujia in Mazhen to meet his wife. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Changping Dispatch: The majority of Fang's army intends to concentrate at Huiye within Yanqing County. However, as a certain army blocked them from Yanqing, they are now disrupting Wangbaochuan, Fenshuiling, and Mingling this morning. Fang is still at Shalingliang, and Ji's whereabouts are unknown. Ji plans to use bandit troops, reorganizing them into a certain Northern Route Army, to permanently occupy the deep mountains around Shalingliang, using it as a base to disturb Changping. Remnants of Fang Ji's army are still present around Laojuntang, Changling Mausoleum, and Dahongmen. Fang's army has entered the borders of the ninth and tenth districts of Changping, still attempting to flee south, planning to attack Qinglongqiao, Sanbao, and Dongyuan separately, seizing the opportunity to cross the PingSui Railway and then go south via mountain roads. Units stationed at Kangzhuang and Qinglongqiao have been ordered to be on guard. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Nankou Dispatch: Fang Ji have recently split up due to disagreements, forming separate forces. Yesterday, when retreating from Mingling, they also parted ways, each taking care of themselves. When the two groups retreated west from Mingling, one went to Laojuntang and the other to Fenshuiling. They have now reached the vicinity of Zhuizishan and Wangbaochuan. The cattle, horses, and grain stored by the residents in the Mingling area have been requisitioned by Fang Ji's troops. Luo's brigade of the Second Division is currently stationed around Zhuizishan on the agreed line, maintaining strict vigilance. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are no signs that the Japanese army in Huairou is withdrawing. Currently, there are more than 300 Japanese troops stationed in the city. Armed equipment is deployed at all four gates and on the city walls. Notices have been posted on the streets, stating roughly: "In the demilitarized zone between China and Japan, Fang Ji and other armed troops have invaded, disturbed the good people, extorted money, and imposed heavy requisitions. The common people are suffering all kinds of hardships and cannot live in peace. Therefore, the Japanese army has dispatched troops based on the spirit of the China-Japan armistice agreement. Now that Fang Ji's troops have withdrawn beyond the demilitarized zone, it is hoped that the good people's worries will be alleviated, and peace will prevail. The hope of us yellow people is that the people's living conditions can be turned for the better. The Japanese army is stationed in the demilitarized zone to ensure that the people can live and work in peace. Therefore, we are stationing troops for defense. All of you people must continue to work as usual and do not be alarmed. This is an important announcement. September 28th, Showa 8th year, Japanese Army Commander, etc." (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After retreating from Erdaoguan, Fang Ji's remnants are fleeing towards the border between Chahar and Rehe, in great disarray. A small part that disrupted the Thirteen Tombs has been surrounded and suppressed by the National Army and is no longer a problem. Fang Ji's own whereabouts seem to be directed towards Chicheng and Longguan to join Tang Yulin. There is no confirmed report on where he has arrived. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to information from the transportation sector, after Fang Ji's remnants failed to disrupt the Changping Mingling area, about 1,000 die-hard youth army members of Ji's group crossed Erdaoguan on the morning of the 1st and fled northwest. Recently, they have fled to Yongning, northeast of Yanqing, and are entrenched in the rear. Approximately 2,000 remaining troops are currently concentrated around Jiuduhe, west of Huanghuazhen. There are still a few plainclothes remnants hiding in the mountains near Mingling, but the National Army has dispatched troops to strictly guard against them and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. It is rumored that Fang Ji himself is still directing operations in Pingyi, collecting remnants, and preparing to flee north. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Zhu Shiqin, section chief of the Ping Military Affairs Commission, accompanied by Japanese military officer Chayama, passed through Tianjin at 12 o'clock on the night of the 1st. He will meet with Japanese Army Staff Officer Ohashi in Yuguan. They will begin negotiations with Suzuki on the issue of bandit suppression in Luandong on the morning of the 2nd. If there is no result, they must go to Changchun to negotiate with Hishikari. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Luandong bandit suppression security team was blocked by the Japanese army for the second time, the Military Affairs Commission sent section chief Zhu Shiqin, accompanied by Japanese military officer Chayama, to Yuguan last night to contact Kita Seiichi, a staff officer of the Kwantung Army. Zhu and Chayama arrived in Yuguan this morning to meet with Kita for discussions. As of 6 p.m. today, no telegram has been received from Zhu. A telegram should arrive in Beiping tonight or tomorrow. The time of departure of the security team depends on the outcome of the negotiations. It is rumored that the reason for the security team being blocked was not the intention of the Kwantung Army leadership, but merely the claim of a certain lower-ranking military officer. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changli: At 4 a.m. on the 2nd, bandits raided the beach at Beidaihe and confiscated the weapons of some of the local police. On the night of the 1st, bandits raided Huangtuguan again but were repelled by our security team. There are many refugees at the beach, urgently awaiting relief. More than 1,000 bandits who previously entered from Yiyuan Pass have spread to the areas of Yuguan, Zhentai, and Touying. The bandits in Funing have looted enough and fled in large numbers. The situation in Luandong appears to be easing on the surface, but is actually dangerous internally. Two hundred Japanese soldiers from Yuguan passed through Changli on the 2nd and headed to Tanggu. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a letter from a foreigner, on September 23rd, bandits burned and looted Touying, several miles north of Funing, and kidnapped hundreds of men and women. Similar news has been reported from other sources. Japanese military officer Chayama has gone to Luandong today to investigate the bandit situation and to assess whether there is a need to send additional Chinese special police to the area to suppress the bandits. The Chinese authorities are concerned about the Japanese delaying permission to send additional police forces to the area to suppress the bandits, as if a compromise is not quickly reached, the bandit problem will spread and become difficult to control.

<p>Various Princes Express Welcome to the Central Government's Commissioners</p>
<p>Panchen Sends Song Zheyuan Fine Horses, Soon to Go West for Pacification</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong Convenes a Discussion on Inner Mongolian Autonomy</p>
<p>Beiping: The government has decided to send Huang Shaoxiong and Shi Qingyang to Inner Mongolia to pacify the various leagues and banners. The heads of the various leagues and banners have expressed their welcome. Because the central government plans to send senior officials to Mongolia for pacification, Xiao Zhenying's and Pang Jiang's trips have been temporarily suspended. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In Mongolia, anyone without a position must enlist at the age of fifteen. Each banner has several hundred regular soldiers if many, and at least a hundred or so if few. In times of war, all men become soldiers, and women are responsible for logistics. The people still follow Genghis Khan's tradition of martial valor and all have private guns. Panchen telegraphed Song Zheyuan from the east to present two fine horses. They will soon go west for pacification. Song sent a telegram on the 2nd to express his gratitude. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Prince De of Inner Mongolia, in the name of the three Inner Mongolian leagues, notified the various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia that the Inner Mongolia High Degree of Autonomy Conference would be held at Beller Temple on September 28th. Because the majority could not participate, it was not officially held. Prince De personally went to Beller Temple to invite representatives from various leagues and banners to talk and exchange views. Previously, representatives were sent to Zhangjiakou to invite the twelve banner chiefs of Zhangjiakou to participate. The twelve banner chiefs pushed Temurbuler, the chief of the Zharasun banner, to be the plenipotentiary representative. He went to see Song Zheyuan to ask for instructions on everything. A self-government conference was also held in Duolun on September 25th, the background of which was completely manipulated by a certain country. Only a few representatives from the various leagues and banners participated. The purpose of the certain country is still to promote Mongolia's separation from the government. The representatives of the various leagues and banners all deeply understand the righteousness and unanimously support the government, so it ended without results. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission held a temporary meeting on the 1st and decided on a draft outline for Inner Mongolian autonomy, with detailed decisions on the scope of Inner Mongolian autonomy, the limits of autonomy, the autonomous regions, the autonomous funding, and the establishment of an Inner Mongolian Autonomy Preparatory Committee, stipulating that the heads of the various leagues of Inner Mongolia and central personnel, as well as personnel from the Chahar and Suiyuan provincial governments, jointly organize it. When Inner Mongolia declares autonomy, in addition to Inner Mongolia's diplomacy and military affairs still being handled by the central government, other matters of a local nature will be handled locally. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) When Huang Shaoxiong convened personnel from the General Staff Headquarters and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission on the 2nd to discuss the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy, he provided the draft outline of Inner Mongolian autonomy decided by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for reference. If there are no revisions, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review, and after obtaining the consent of the princes of Inner Mongolia, the Inner Mongolian Autonomy Preparatory Committee will draft detailed rules for the Inner Mongolian autonomy plan based on this outline. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Asiatic Society, in view of the recent Inner Mongolian autonomy incident, and observing from the perspective of the religion and culture of the Mongolian region, believes that it has research value. It convened a research meeting on the Inner Mongolian autonomy issue on the 2nd, and designated Ma Hezi, Gesang Zeren, and others to study and propose a plan for submission to the central government for reference. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Sang, the representative of the Panchen Lama, issued a statement on Inner Mongolian autonomy, saying that the Panchen Lama is currently returning from Sonid to Bai Ling Temple at the Four Princes' Mansion, planning to rest for half a month before going to the Yike Zhao League for pacification. Inner Mongolian autonomy, it is heard, is based on Sun Yat-sen's principle of equality among the five races and national self-determination and autonomy, promoting local autonomy and establishing an Inner Mongolian autonomous government in order to consolidate the Wuyi, Xilin Gol, and Alxa leagues and other tribes, and jointly resist foreign insults. It is not in violation of the central government. What is required is to organize a strong local autonomous government under the guidance of the central government to defend the country and avoid falling again. Military and diplomatic affairs are still handled by the central government, and the local government will never interfere. This proves that the princes are all able to deeply understand the righteousness. Reports that Japanese planes took Prince De to Changchun for a meeting are false. If the central government can take the opportunity to guide, not only will there be no major problems, but it can also promote the further consolidation of Western Mongolia. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission previously telegraphed the governments of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, requesting them to investigate the truth of Western Mongolian autonomy in the vicinity. The governments of the provinces have telegraphed back recently, stating the latest situation and saying that at a time when the Northeast has not yet been settled, the system should not be changed. They have been advised to dissuade them and will discuss it later. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Qingyang is unwilling to go to Inner Mongolia and has requested the central government to appoint another senior official to go to Mongolia for guidance. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Movement of Troops Will Be Decided by the Central Government</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying telegraphed Wang Shiping, his representative stationed in Beiping, saying: "Our army's trip to Qingxi to reclaim land was originally based on the order of the central government to urge its commencement, so we had no choice but to comply and go west. However, rumors on the road are full of errors, causing those who do not understand the truth to harbor doubts and anxieties, and to rise up in opposition. But the facts are all there. Our army only follows orders. In the event of obstacles occurring along the way, perhaps we will resort to military means, but we will only report to the central government, request instructions, and abide by them. Whether to continue to order the advance, or to stop midway, is all decided by the central government. Even if there are those who use force to compel us, we will never make contact, causing unnecessary internal strife." (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Shi Yousan is becoming increasingly active in Tianjin. He has recently cancelled the name "East Asia Allied Army" and changed it to "North China People's Self-Salvation Army," appointing 20 army commanders. In recent days, he has sent many people to Xinhe, Baodi, Sanhe, Jixian, and other counties to contact bandits in order to expand his strength. Someone once asked Shi that since he appointed a large number of army commanders, where would the soldiers come from? Shi replied, "Having army commanders means not worrying about not having soldiers." He has now sent people to various counties to persuade bandits, thinking that this trip will not be in vain, and he will definitely achieve considerable results.

<p>Central Memorial Week</p>
<h3 id="e12">President Wang's Report on the Week's Political Situation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>National Assembly Unaffected by the Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>The Remaining Forces of Fang Ji Will Surely Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>Military and Financial Authorities Will Not Be Passive Due to Difficulties</p>
<p>This Is Precisely the Era for Our Hard Work and Dedication</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang's original political report at the Central Party Headquarters' memorial week on the 2nd stated: Regarding the work of this past week, I can report on several matters.</p>
<p>(1) Postponement of the Fifth Plenary Session: The Central Standing Committee resolved last Thursday to postpone the Fifth Plenary Session for one year. The reasons have already been stated in the resolution. According to Article 27 of the General Regulations, the National Congress can be postponed under unavoidable circumstances, but for no more than one year. Now, the unavoidable reasons for the postponement are: First, Commissioners Chen Jitang and Li Zongren telegraphed suggesting a postponement, with reasons attached. Second, the rehabilitation work in the North China war zone and the bandit suppression work are not yet complete. Postponing the congress for one year allows us to redouble our efforts during this year to complete these two important tasks before the congress convenes. Will the postponement of the Fifth Plenary Session cause any obstacles? We know that the Fifth Plenary Session has two purposes. First, many hope that if the Fifth Plenary Session is held, the proposal to convene the National Assembly ahead of schedule can be put forward. The proposal to convene the National Assembly ahead of schedule this year was planned to be put forward at the Provisional Representative Assembly on July 1st. Since the July 1st Provisional Assembly will not be held, and the Fifth Plenary Session in November is also postponed, will the convening of the National Assembly also be affected? The central government has given this issue very careful consideration, so it has also resolved to still follow the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee last December, to convene the National Assembly in March of the 24th year of the Republic, and that the National Government will start preparations now, such as the election law, the organization law, and the construction of the venue, etc., all of which must be actively carried out. So, although it is not possible to convene ahead of schedule, the decision of the Third Plenary Session is still being implemented as before. It must be understood that convening the National Assembly requires considerable time. If the July 1st Provisional Assembly could be held, then the convening of the National Assembly could hopefully be moved up from March of the 24th year of the Republic to March of the 23rd year of the Republic, giving eight or nine months for preparation from July of this year to March of next year. Since the July Provisional Assembly cannot be held, even if the Fifth Plenary Session in November can be held, there would not be enough time to prepare for convening the National Assembly in March of the 23rd year of the Republic. Therefore, the Central Standing Committee does not simply talk about advancing the date, but still decides to prepare according to the original plan of party rule, with the ultimate goal of cultivating democratic politics. Only in this way can we demand true constitutionalism, not false constitutionalism. Only in this way is political tutelage necessary. Today, we must make twelve times the effort to complete the work that should be done during the period of political tutelage, in order to usher in true constitutionalism. Although the National Assembly cannot be convened ahead of schedule due to time constraints, the convening of the National Assembly will absolutely not be obstructed by this postponement of the Fifth Plenary Session. Second, from the perspective of the Party, the most important thing now is spiritual unity to jointly overcome national difficulties. These eight characters can be said to be the fundamental principle of all work for comrades today. Even if the Fifth Plenary Session is not held, we must continue to do these eight characters. Even if the Fifth Plenary Session is held, we must still base our work on these eight characters. After the September 18th Incident, at the Fourth Plenary Session, we already put forward these eight characters. Up to now, we cannot say that we have not accomplished anything, but we also cannot say that we have accomplished everything. We know that revolutionary comrades are all very enthusiastic. After confirming their understanding of the current situation, their emotional enthusiasm to implement it is extremely urgent. Therefore, when encountering obstacles, they are eager to eliminate them, and differences in opinion often lead to disputes, which are unavoidable. Now, for the sake of national difficulties, we must concentrate our sincerity and unity under the eight characters of "jointly overcoming national difficulties," sacrificing minor opinions for more important issues. Only in this way can we be said to be sincerely united, and only in this way can we be said to be jointly overcoming national difficulties. Even if political opinions cannot be sacrificed and conflicts arise, if they stem from loyalty to the Party and the nation, that is also good. Then we can implement the transfer of political power in accordance with the Party's decisions. It must be understood that for a matter, one must not only have opinions, but also have responsibility. In doing things, one must not only reject, but also have the courage to take responsibility. This is the right way to do politics. In a constitutional country, if Party A is rejected, then Party B must come forward to take responsibility. Within a party, if there are several opinions, it should be the same. If one only rejects and does not take responsibility, it will not work. For the past year, the central government has held this attitude of patience and responsibility. It dares not say that what it has done is without mistakes, but if no one comes forward to take responsibility, it cannot casually abandon the responsibilities it has shouldered. Today, we will continue to do things in this spirit of patience and responsibility, seeking unity within the Party and cooperation from the people, working together. If the Fifth Plenary Session is held this November, it will merely be a review of the progress made since the Fourth Plenary Session in being sincerely united and jointly overcoming national difficulties. If we can intensify our efforts today to complete political tasks such as rehabilitation in the North China war zone and bandit suppression as soon as possible, and if comrades from all sides can set aside personal prejudices and work together for the good of the country, then Party and national affairs will not be obstructed by the postponement of the congress, and holding the congress next year will naturally bring more comfort than holding it this year.</p>
<p>(2) The Issue of Inner Mongolian Autonomy: Recently, Mongolian princes have requested autonomy. The central government is paying close attention to this. Is this request for autonomy a separatist movement or a puppet movement? We dare not say for sure yet and need to investigate further. If it is a separatist or puppet movement, then we have no choice but to resolutely suppress it. On the other hand, if this request is entirely for the sake of autonomy, then we want to say a few words. Autonomy is not only needed by Mongolia, but by the entire China. Autonomy is a common demand of the Chinese people, especially the advocacy of our Party. Comrades of our Party have risked their lives to diligently implement the first important task stipulated in the Founding Program. Forgetting autonomy is not being a follower of the Premier. However, the completion of autonomy cannot be expected to happen suddenly. There are two prerequisites for completing autonomy. The first is to quell rebellions, and the second is to reorganize the army. Without quelling rebellions and reorganizing the army, it is like the situation in Chahar Province during May and June, where a small area was crowded with 200,000 to 300,000 disbanded soldiers. How can there be autonomy? We must never postpone autonomy without reason. We must start immediately when it is possible, and when it is not possible, we must first work hard to eliminate obstacles to make it possible. Mongolia has its own special circumstances, but today we have implemented the principles of equality and freedom in terms of ethnicity, religion, and customs, and we respect each other. In addition, there is one thing to be noted. Many Inner Mongolian compatriots still live as nomads. Nomadism requires extremely vast lands. Today, the most important economic principle in the world is to support more people with less land, but nomadism is the opposite. Therefore, there is a real need to change the production methods of Mongolia. However, Mongolian compatriots may think that since most of the land reclamation is done by Han Chinese, the Mongolian grazing lands will be oppressed. This concern should of course be dispelled. At the same time, although we want Mongolian compatriots to progress from nomadism to agriculture, we will never force them. We will simply provide assistance to proceed. For this matter, the central government has established a special committee to be responsible. In short, we will never postpone the process of autonomy because it is not requested, nor will we perfunctorily deal with it because it is requested. What we are concerned with is whether the obstacles to autonomy have been removed and whether the work of autonomy can begin. This is the case for the interior, and it is the same for Mongolia. Mongolia has a vast territory, and the government is most concerned about the suffering of the majority of the people. The items that should be handled for autonomy have been entrusted to the Ministry of Interior and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. In essence, true autonomy and separatist or puppet movements are completely different and cannot be confused.</p>
<p>(3) Recent Disturbances in North China: The recent disturbances in North China were caused by Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang. If everyone still remembers the frugal telegram that my brother and Mr. Chiang jointly sent on July 28th, and the urgent telegram sent to Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Cha Tingkai on September 6th, you will know that this disturbance was not entirely unexpected. In the frugal telegram, I made a statement that Chahar Province could not possibly support so many disbanded soldiers, and I pointed out that the loss of Duolun the previous time was due to the excessive number of disbanded soldiers stationed there. After they ate and burned everything, they could not gain a foothold, and were occupied by Liu Guitang. If the troops are not reorganized, Chahar Province cannot be stabilized for a day. Seeing this point, we paid close attention to the reorganization of the troops in Chahar Province. The urgent telegram of September 6th detailed the contents of the reorganization. After multiple contacts and consultations with all the armies, those who were to be incorporated were incorporated, and those who were to take office took office. Only Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang had other plans and refused to accept it from beginning to end. Some newspapers even thought that the central government had not settled them, leading them to have nowhere to go, but they did not know that they were wolves with wild ambitions and would not accept settlement. Among their troops, there are still well-known communists such as Zhang Mutao. In the past, when the situation was unclear, some people even defended Fang Ji, saying that they were determined to resist Japan. But now that the facts are before us, they are trying to become Liu Yu and Zhang Bangchang, ultimately causing the recent disturbance, falsely using the name of resisting Japan to secretly carry out treason. It is truly the ugliest thing in the world. Fortunately, the disturbance is not very big. Now the Beiping Military Commission is responsible for handling it. This group of Liu Yu and Zhang Bangchang's seeds will undoubtedly be wiped out.</p>
<p>(4) The Economic Committee Issue: The National Economic Committee was originally chaired by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek as Chairman and Mr. Song Ziwen as Vice Chairman. The preparatory office has been established and has been working for a long time. The cotton and wheat loan is assigned to the Economic Committee for distribution and is specifically designated for production and construction. Mr. Chiang, as Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, firmly resigned from his concurrent position as Chairman of the Economic Committee to show the people of the country his determination not to divert the loan for military use. The central government has now decided to appoint my brother, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, and Mr. Song Ziwen as standing committee members, and they will take office in a few days. As for the use of the loan, it has also been decided to give priority to cotton yarn relief and food relief. My country's cotton yarn industry is on the verge of bankruptcy and needs urgent relief without a moment's delay. As far as food is concerned, a famine year is of course a disaster, but now a bumper year is also a disaster. In the past, my brother reported roughly on the situation of stagnant sales of wheat produced in the interior at the National Government Memorial Week, and later sent the four ministries of Interior, Finance, Railways, and Industry to conduct a joint investigation. The situation of stagnant sales of rice seems to be even more serious. Some people think that the stagnant sales of domestic rice are caused by the loan of American rice. But if American rice is not borrowed, why would domestic rice also have stagnant sales? Then the reason must be elsewhere. This can be seen from this. As for the relief methods, I will report again after a general agreement is reached. Regarding the organization of the Economic Committee, there are many rumors circulating outside, such as how to expand it or add several offices. These rumors are not very accurate. We have only added a Cotton Industry Control Committee because we are currently starting to control the cotton industry, so we have added an agency. Or maybe we will add a Food Committee in the future. It must be understood that we are setting up agencies for the sake of work, and we are definitely not setting up work for the sake of agencies. Saying how to expand it and how to add to it is inaccurate. Speaking of economic issues, I would also like to add a few words about finance. Since the cotton and wheat loan is entirely used for production and construction, what about military and political expenses? Since the September 18th Incident, military and political expenses have been insufficient. This is a fact that everyone knows and does not need to be elaborated on. What is most painful is that there are only maintenance expenses and no project expenses, and even the maintenance expenses are insufficient. If the military and government only aim for maintenance and do not use it for projects, what is the point? There is no need to say much about the indispensability of project expenses. The bandit suppression in Jiangxi can be taken as an example. At present, bandit suppression in Jiangxi requires money for military operations, and even more money is needed to provide relief to the local areas after the bandits are driven away. Because those areas have been completely destroyed by the communists using extremely cruel scorched-earth tactics when they withdrew. They have truly become a land of nothingness. There are no houses, no cattle, no farm tools, and no seeds. How can the remaining people live in this place? After we recover the bandit areas, we often hope that the people can work together to defend themselves to prevent the communists from coming again. However, one needs tools to make a living, and one can only defend oneself if one can make a living. There is no way to obtain the tools of survival, so how can we talk about self-defense? Therefore, after the communists are gone, the bandit suppression work must focus on the economic revival of the countryside. And the urgent task of revival is first to save the dying. Saving the dying first requires enabling them to make a living. All the houses, fields, cattle, farm tools, and seeds that were destroyed by the bandits must be prepared one by one. One can only defend oneself if one can make a living, and only by being able to defend oneself can one prevent the communists from trampling on them again. From this, it can be seen that bandit suppression work is not only about military affairs, but especially about finance. Today, some people only advocate austerity, and even advocate doing nothing and governing, which is really not paying attention to this. However, where does this economic relief come from? The difficulties of military and political expenses are already such, and the urgent need for finance after the recovery of the bandit areas is also such. The difficulties faced by the political and military authorities can be seen from this one aspect. The other day, my brother went to Shanghai to meet with Mr. Song Ziwen to discuss this issue. Although I thought of some solutions, I cannot report them for the time being until the central government makes a decision. In short, today is precisely the era for our comrades to work hard and dedicate ourselves. Because it is hard, we must work hard. Because it is poor, we must especially dedicate ourselves. Everything can be sacrificed, but the responsibility of saving the country cannot be shirked. Everything can be conceded, but the spirit of going to the rescue cannot but be active. The responsibility for saving the country and preserving its existence is inescapable. (Central News Agency telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e13">National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 2nd. Lin Sen, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Kong Xiangxi, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Shaokuan, Zhang Ji, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 400 National Government staff members attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Ju Zheng gave a report entitled "Division of Labor and Cooperation," stating that whether in military affairs, politics, or economics, everything must be divided and cooperated in order to be effective. In the past, China only had division of labor without cooperation, resulting in an unfavorable situation. The September 18th Incident is one example. It is hoped that in the future, all citizens will exert their individual abilities and adhere to the four characters of "division of labor and cooperation" to unite the entire China.

<h3 id="e14">Ministry of Finance Plans to Issue New Treasury Bonds <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Totaling Approximately 50 Million Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to financial circles, since the establishment of the armistice agreement in North China, the government's finances have been running a deficit of 10 million yuan per month after fully disbursing military and political expenses. Since the U.S. loan has been designated for specific purposes, it cannot be diverted to military and political expenses, and it is necessary to raise funds through other means. From January of this year to the present, the government has repaid several tens of millions of yuan in domestic debt principal and interest each month. Although the collateral for these bonds is customs and consolidated taxes, the central government has actually reduced its burden by several tens of millions of yuan. It is planned to use this collateral to continue issuing treasury bonds. To take into account the financial capacity of the banking sector, the offering will be spread over several months. The total amount has not yet been determined, but it is approximately 50 million yuan. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Rural Economic Focus on Investigation – Reality <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Rural economy in China's economic problems. Has a very important relationship. The whole country, from top to bottom. All are paying close attention. On the government side, it is being discussed alongside the issue of controlled economy. In general society and academic circles. It is also recognized that if this rural problem. If a solution is not properly obtained. Then all economic construction. All cannot establish a foundation. These are all essential arguments. Ancient Confucian scholars discussed politics. Both take the farming and weaving of peasants. As the foundation of regulating the family, governing the country, and pacifying the world. Up until modern times. Capitalist economic organizations. Imported into China. Mechanical industry. Gradually developed. The old economic structure centered on agriculture. Then completely transformed and tended toward cities. Modern economic society. Superficially, it focuses on "exchange". In reality, it still lies in the production organization of large industries. And the economic turnover frequency of industrial production and financial capital. Compared with agricultural production, which turns over only once a year or half a year. Cannot be measured in the same way. Thus, agriculture is increasingly difficult to establish a foothold. What's more, in the past five years. The world economic panic is intensifying. Dumping policies are prevalent. Our Republic of China cannot establish high tariffs for defense. Nor can it mobilize the entire country for economic competition. Then, our rural areas, lacking organizational strength. Have no choice but to be the first to suffer its ruin.</p>
<p>Due to the collapse of the rural economy. On the one hand, it intensifies the general economic panic. On the other hand, it stimulates social unrest. Thus, "Revitalizing the countryside." Has become a common and consistent trend across the country. Rural economic surveys. Have also been implemented in order. In terms of current needs. This matter is truly indispensable and should not be delayed. What a pity is that this kind of investigation. Only belongs to small-scale actions. The number of investigators is only a few or a dozen. The surveyed area. Only three or four provinces. And in the three or four provinces. Only part of it is reached. The information obtained at most only reflects the situation in a certain place. But for solving the entire Chinese rural economic problem. The effect is very small. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the Economic Committee. Can pay close attention to this issue. Conduct a concrete investigation of the whole country on a large scale. Then plan a solution. Then not only will it directly help to properly understand the rural economic organization. Indirectly, it can also assist in promoting political construction. What is most needed in today's rural economic survey. Is the following three points. First, attention should be paid to the turnover of rural finance. My country's rural technology. Is really inferior to others. But the diligence of the farmers. Is rare in the world. Limited only by the season. In the northern provinces. Harvested once a year. Its financial turnover. Therefore, it must also be once a year. The Yangtze River basin is at most twice. Therefore, it must also be turned over every six months. Its inability to adapt to the current general economic situation is obvious. If this status quo is not reformed quickly. Then the countryside will become more and more exhausted. Second. We must begin an investigation of land relations. My country's agricultural villages. Have long formed a system of overly small farms. Regardless of whether they are owner-farmers or tenant farmers. The living standards are extremely low. Land distribution. Each place is the same. And the central government. Also lacks accurate statistics on this. Local governments. Also lack detailed investigations. The preliminary work of revitalizing the countryside in the future. Must be based on the distribution of land. Seek a solid understanding. Then deal with them separately. Only then can disputes be eliminated. Establish a foundation. Third, attention must be paid to the adjustment of agricultural products. Although my country's farmers' thinking. Still yearns for the self-sufficiency of one family. But in fact, it has long embarked on the path of commodity production. Once the grain market stagnates. The economy will lose its balance. The result of rural decline. Reflected in the cities. At this time. We must truly understand the special circumstances of agricultural products in the source areas. Or set up a grain public sale market. Or the national treasury subsidizes the losses of farmers. As a regulator, then the rural economy. Then there is a chance for regeneration.</p>
<p>In short. My country's national economy. Due to the suffocation of the agricultural economy. Causing the entire society to stagnate at the point of death. Suppose. Today, if we can transcend this point. Then economic revival. Can be expected in the coming years. And its only method. Is to see whether the rural problem can be solved as</p>
<h3 id="e17">All Germany Celebrates the Autumn Harvest Festival <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Hitler Addresses 500,000 Citizens</p>
<p>Sacredness of Labor, Acknowledging Farmers as Pillars of the State</p>
<p>National Socialist Revolution in Preserving the Nation and Developing Democracy</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today Germany is holding a National Harvest Thanksgiving Festival.</p>
<p>The location is at the foot of the Pogberg Mountain in Heimelon. On this day, due to the sunny weather, coupled with the fact that Premier Hitler himself came to give a speech, the number of farmers gathered from all over the country reached 500,000, which is truly an unprecedented grand gathering. (National Telegram on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) When Premier Hitler arrived at the meeting, 20,000 National Socialist Party soldiers guarded the road. There were also many people accompanying Mr. Hitler. After Agriculture Minister Darré gave a speech, Mr. Hitler took the stage to address the crowd, saying that the National Socialist Party revolution abolished all distinctions of status and class, and allowed both mental and physical work to regain a place of honor in Germany. Therefore, the National Socialist Party revolution is truly great. Mr. Hitler continued, "Liberalism excessively rewarded individual personality, causing individual status to (rise into the clouds, Marxism takes all of humanity as its object, neither of which is as enthusiastic as National Socialism in supporting its own nation. It must be understood that those who cultivate the soil to feed the people and develop families for a long time are the most respectable representatives of the German nation. Farmers are the pillars of Germany and its only guarantee for the future. Our political struggle is purely to preserve our nation and not to conquer foreign nations." Mr. Hitler concluded that all economic losses in Germany can be remedied. For example, if a citizen goes bankrupt, they can still run a business again if absolutely necessary. But if a farmer's cultivated land is taken away, the loss to the national economy can never be recovered. Therefore, we are determined to save German farmers. However, this kind of cause takes a very long time and cannot be accomplished overnight. We once spent eight months stopping Germany's decline, but if we want to save the German people and German farmers, farmers must have faith in us." (Havas Telegram on the 1st)</p>

<p>(Berlin) As winter approaches, the poor will feel the pain. Prussian Premier Goering recently conducted a publicity campaign to prevent famine among the German people and organized an agency to accept donations from all parties to help the poor. It has been reported that this agency has received potatoes worth 750,000 marks donated by various parties. It has also been reported that the German royal families and the former ruling royal families have also donated large amounts of timber, grains, and livestock to the agency.

<p>(Berlin) Today is President Hindenburg's 86th birthday. Congratulatory telegrams from all over the world have arrived like snowflakes. President Hindenburg has gone to the Neudeck Villa in East Prussia to avoid the birthday celebrations. All newspapers have published lengthy articles recording his life's achievements and praising him to the utmost. (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) As President Hindenburg celebrates his 86th birthday, celebrations are being held throughout Germany, which are extremely lively. However, the issue of Hindenburg's successor has become even more rampant as a result. In the past, some people advocated establishing a regency once Hindenburg left office. Some people are now advocating this idea again. Some people even say that someone from the Hohenzollern royal family will assume this position. Others say that although Hitler fears that some important members of the National Socialist Party will not agree with this move, Mr. Hitler himself is not firmly opposed. But we should accept this kind of news with extreme caution. (Havas Telegram on the 2nd)</p>

<p>New Monetary Policy May Be Revealed</p>
<p>Relief Plans and Credit Expansion Go Hand in Hand</p>
<p>Hyde Park - U.S. President Roosevelt will depart from here at 5:00 PM tonight for Chicago, where he will address the annual convention of the American Legion tomorrow. This organization is the most influential non-partisan group. According to New York dispatches, the financial circles of that city hope that Roosevelt will announce a new economic policy in his speech. However, regarding the content of the speech, there has been no indication as of tonight. White House staff also declined to comment on Senator Harrison's proposal to directly inflate the currency to pay veterans' pensions. Currently, veterans are being incited by those advocating currency inflation, hoping to overturn the approved reduction in disability pensions and advocating for currency inflation. However, the veterans have not yet expressed their position. Today, many of the President's close advisors advised him not to go to Chicago, saying that the trip might be politically dangerous. The whole country is waiting anxiously for his monetary policy to avoid discussing trivial issues. But by the afternoon, the President declared that he felt it was his duty to meet with the veterans, so he boarded the train at 5:00 PM and set off. Before the President's departure, he received phone calls and telegrams from all sides, urging him to avoid currency inflation in his monetary policy. But until his departure, he refused to express his policy on the matter. However, before his departure, the U.S. President issued several orders to alleviate the suffering of the unemployed and promote the recovery of all industries. He specifically ordered Relief Administrator Hopkins to establish non-profit companies to engage in the purchase and distribution of relief supplies. The purchases will all be daily necessities, to be distributed free of charge to the unemployed. In addition, he sent a letter to Jones, the Director-General of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, authorizing the implementation of a plan to encourage banks to sell capital bonds to the company, thereby increasing bank capital and achieving the effect of credit expansion. Therefore, it is widely believed that the President is still determined to first expand credit to the extreme before considering direct currency inflation. (National News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>Sends Diplomatic Notes to England, France, Germany, and the Little Entente</p>
<p>Advocates Negotiating Preferential Agreements</p>
<p>(Geneva) - The Italian government recently sent diplomatic notes to the governments of the other three signatory countries of the Four-Power Pact and the countries of the Little Entente regarding the economic development of the Danube River basin. This matter has now attracted the deep attention of the League of Nations. It is widely believed that the Italian government has clearly abandoned its previous opposition to special preferential tariffs for the countries of the Danube basin. Although the content of the Italian government's diplomatic note has not yet been made public, it is understood that Italy has suggested negotiating an agreement on preferential tariffs for agricultural products with the countries of the Danube basin. In addition, it has expressed its willingness to conclude a treaty with Austria on similar preferential treatment for industrial products. It is said that the Italian diplomatic note also proposed that the signatories of the Four-Power Pact begin consultations on the one hand, and that the Danube River countries also conduct negotiations simultaneously on the other hand, striving to reach a broad understanding on the principle of mutual agreement. Furthermore, as things stand now, the Little Entente seems to be indifferent to Italy's proposal, and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš even has other plans, so he is obviously unwilling to endorse it. However, there are also signs of convergence between the two groups, and it is expected that a joint meeting will be held soon to discuss the possibility of establishing multilateral treaties.

<p>Treats People Like Children</p>
<p>Shares Hardships with Soldiers</p>
<p>Reuters Italian dispatch from Galesivod - Although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is awe-inspiring throughout the world, he is full of emotion. This can be seen in trivial matters, and it is no wonder that he wins the hearts of the people. Mussolini once came here to observe army maneuvers. One day, he drove through a small Alpine village in the "war zone" and heard an old man shout, "I must talk to Mussolini!" Mussolini immediately stopped the car, got out, and shook hands with the villagers one by one. Then he listened quietly as the old man described his plight. The old man was over eighty years old. After listening, Mussolini said, "I also know the bitterness of poverty." He then took out a stack of banknotes and placed it in the old man's hand. Just as the old man was about to thank him, Mussolini had already gotten into the car and sped away. One day, Mussolini's car passed through the Bai Liji mountain pass and saw a small squad of artillerymen dragging a 105mm gun, looking very tired. He shouted loudly, "Wait a moment, I will help you!" He jumped out of the car and, under the command of a junior officer, did his best to help the soldiers drag the gun. At that time, the scorching sun was in the sky, and he was sweating profusely, but he didn't care. Whenever Mussolini passed through a village, the villagers would bring the old and the young out to greet him. Mussolini would always get out of the car and mingle with the crowd. One day, an old woman spoke to him. When Mussolini was leaving, she said happily, "Mussolini, I am deeply grateful to you. Now I can die in peace!" Mussolini replied with a smile, "Please don't say that, otherwise I will never forget you!" Mussolini always had a cheerful expression on his face, and when he talked about anecdotes from the European war with his own reserve brigade, he gesticulated and was overjoyed. Whenever Mussolini met an old comrade-in-arms, he would call out their name and salute them. One day, he stopped outside a vineyard and talked to the owner in detail, inquiring about his family affairs and this year's harvest. He also kissed the vineyard owner's children and shook hands with every man and woman working in the field before leaving. Before two teams engaged in simulated combat exercises, Mussolini inspected the equipment of both teams very carefully. During the maneuvers, he would get up with the soldiers at 5:00 AM every morning and rest at 5:00 PM. At 2:00 PM, he would have lunch with General Balstrocci, the Undersecretary of the Army, under a large tree, and his food would be taken from the soldiers' rations.</p>

<p>Focus on North China</p>
<p>Seeking to Realize the Old Dream of the Twenty-One Demands</p>
<p>Obstructing Russian Influence in Manchuria</p>
<p>Planning to Deal with the CER Case with Drastic Measures</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Since taking office, the new Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota Kōki has been in contact with the army, navy, and financial authorities regarding diplomatic national policy. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister Hirota's new policy has been accepted by both the military and financial departments. Hirota is scheduled to enter the palace within days to ask the Emperor for approval, and in mid-month he is scheduled to visit Elder Saionji in Okitsu to explain the content of Hirota's diplomacy and seek the elder's understanding. (China United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will adopt a positive policy towards North China. The purpose of the visit to Shanxi by Yano and other members of the Japanese legation in China is to investigate the so-called three major railway plans in North China. When Foreign Minister Katō presented the Twenty-One Demands to the Beijing government in 1915, Hirota was the chief of the first section of the Trade Bureau and drafted a proposal to Foreign Minister Katō to include the Yellow River area in the special interests of Manchuria. Because his demands were even greater than Katō's original proposal, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not adopt his proposal to avoid conflict with Britain. Hirota was depressed. Now that he has become Foreign Minister, he wants to try his new diplomacy himself. Hirota has always said that diplomacy towards China should avoid names and take reality. Therefore, how to avoid the name of the Twenty-One Demands and take the reality of the new Twenty-One Demands is a diplomatic tactic that deserves the attention of our countrymen. (North China Daily News Tokyo dispatch, 17th) The complete sealing off of Russian ambitions in the Far East is a major task that the new Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota hopes to accomplish during his tenure. According to the Kokumin Shimbun, a newspaper with extreme nationalist overtones, the new Foreign Minister and the military are in complete agreement on this matter, believing that in order to achieve this great goal, it is necessary to first clear up all of Soviet Russia's businesses in the Far East, starting with the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway to the puppet state. Thereafter, according to the military's opinion, which has been endorsed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russia should be granted broad and permanent concessions in the Maritime Provinces, Kamchatka, and the southern part of Sakhalin Island. The newspaper also said that before Hirota took office as Foreign Minister, although he had been the ambassador to Russia, he firmly believed that in order to break the deadlock in the negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway, drastic measures must be taken. Now that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recognized that allowing the current deadlock to drag on will hinder the conclusion of other important matters, which is meaningless, the new Foreign Minister is preparing to warn Soviet Russia, declaring that the current situation will make it necessary for Japan to intervene, at which time the meeting may be terminated and a new method sought to resolve the matter. If necessary, he will not hesitate to resort to force. It is said that the young and middle-aged members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs all believe that the present is the best time to take decisive measures, and Hirota agrees. According to the newspaper, the first step is to invite the Soviet ambassador to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain that Japan is willing to accelerate the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations for political reasons. The second step is to closely observe the progress of the negotiations. If it is still not satisfactory, then a strong warning will be issued to the Russian government, declaring that the negotiations will be completely broken off. The Japanese now believe that Soviet Russia is focusing on technical aspects and minor details, making it difficult for the negotiations to progress, thereby delaying the resolution, which is a sign of great lack of sincerity on the part of the Russians. If Japan joins the intervention and declares the termination of the negotiations, all previous understandings will be invalidated, then Soviet Russia must bear full responsibility. Even if this move hinders the resolution of other issues between Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo" and makes the situation more serious, the responsibility should also be borne by Soviet Russia. According to a statement to the press by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although it is said that the situation has not yet reached such a serious point that Japan needs to intervene, there is still plenty of room for mediation before Japan needs to intervene, all newspapers here believe that this statement is only for the propaganda purposes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and strongly claim that the Ministry has firmly decided to issue a serious warning to the Soviet ambassador. As for the Soviet Union's previous proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty, Hirota believes that such a move is still far from being seriously considered. Soviet Russia is eager to establish this treaty because there are several pending cases between Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo." However, if Japan hastily concludes a non-aggression treaty before all the pending cases have been satisfactorily resolved, it would be extremely foolish, because the Japanese believe that Russia needs a period of respite even more than Japan. Concluding a non-aggression treaty at this time would be more beneficial to Russia. Therefore, it is believed that this matter must be discussed after the Far Eastern situation vis-à-vis Russia has been thoroughly clarified. Its true intention is to allow the Far Eastern situation to be adjusted or resolved in accordance with Japan's political ambitions in the Far East before the non-aggression treaty negotiations can be resumed.</p>

<p>The Military Deeply Fears That Neglect Will Lead to Future Troubles</p>
<p>Urging Hirota to Adopt a Policy of Coercive Warfare</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Since Soviet Russia implemented the regulations for entering and exiting the port of Vladivostok on August 24 of this year, foreign ships entering the port must use Russian pilots, which has increased the burden on foreign ships entering and exiting the port. Japan, because of the large number of ships entering and exiting the port, has suffered the greatest losses. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered its consul-general in the area to protest to Russia, but to no avail. It then ordered Ōta, the Japanese ambassador to Russia, to continue to protest, requesting that Japanese ships be exempted from the regulations. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from Ōta stating that Russia had refused to accept Japan's proposal. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that recently Russia has been building fortresses and installing various defensive works in the port, as well as placing submarines. Russia's facilities are aimed at preventing Japan, fearing that military secrets will be leaked, and precautions are very strict. (China United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - According to Japanese military sources, Russia is increasing its defenses and building semi-permanent military facilities on the border between Russia and the puppet state. Although Japan created the puppet state to maintain peace in the Far East, the strength of the Russian side has increased several times before the construction of the puppet state has been successful. If this continues, there may be no day to restrain Russia. Recently, it has also been heard that the puppet government will adopt a policy of concession regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway to avoid conflict between Japan and Russia, but from Japan's perspective, a war of attrition is detrimental to Japan. Therefore, the Japanese military intends to urge Foreign Minister Hirota to adopt a more resolute policy towards Russia, creating the situation that the Japanese military hopes for. It is said that Araki will personally visit Hirota within days to strongly advocate the military's views. (China United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>Striving for Modernization of Armaments</p>
<p>All Officers and Soldiers to Receive Training</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - After the abolition of four divisions by Army Minister Ugaki at the time of the army's reform, the plan for the second army system reform was re-established in Showa 4 (1929). However, due to the Manchurian Incident, its implementation was postponed. However, in view of the recent international situation and the aforementioned army system reform, a new policy of modernizing military equipment was separately established, seeking to realize it with approximately 100 million yen in material preparation costs for this year and approximately 180 million yen for next year. On the one hand, 9,134,000 yen has been budgeted for this year and 6,247,000 yen for next year as supplementary education expenses, so that officers and soldiers can learn how to use new weapons. Officers will receive supplementary education at infantry schools, cavalry schools, field artillery schools, engineering schools, and motor vehicle schools, etc. Non-commissioned officers and soldiers will be educated by the supplementary education classes of each division. Supplementary education is scheduled to be completed by the end of next year. If the material preparation costs are submitted to the Ministry of Finance for budgetary estimates and are not subject to significant reductions, most of the goals can be achieved. From Showa 10 (1935), various new types of weapons will be deployed to units across the country to realize the modernization of the army. (Rengo Tsushin dispatch, 2nd)</p>

After the ceremony, Prime Minister MacDonald and Air Minister Londonderry returned to England by plane, arriving at Croydon Aerodrome near London at 4:30 PM. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) - "Le Journal" published a message stating that when the unveiling ceremony of the monument to the airship R-101 was held in Beauvais today, the British and French Prime Ministers took the opportunity to meet each other and exchanged views. The scope was naturally broad, but both sides expressed sympathy and their views were very consistent, at least in terms of the general goals that the two countries wanted to achieve politically. Daladier and MacDonald discussed the Disarmament Conference, both of whom were very fortunate that the unity of the two countries on the issue of disarmament had been further consolidated during the talks held in Geneva last week.

The cause of the accident is still unknown, and it is only known that the area where the accident occurred was covered in heavy fog.

<p>(Paris) - The famous French political commentator Pentina telegraphed the Paris Echo de Paris this morning from Geneva, stating that France has agreed that after the Germans accept the proposal for a four-year trial period for arms supervision, France will drastically reduce its army. French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Boncour have notified British Foreign Secretary Simon that if the Germans accept the proposal, France will reduce its existing 600,000-strong standing army to 200,000 before the end of the trial period. At the same time, the enlistment period for conscripts will also be reduced from twelve months to seven months. Simon has already conveyed this proposal to German Foreign Minister Neurath. However, upon hearing this news, the Little Entente was greatly alarmed and sought to persuade France to reconsider the proposal, as these countries have always regarded France as a security guarantee and feared that the sudden change in France's attitude would endanger the position of the Little Entente. Poland, due to issues such as the Corridor, was even more apprehensive upon hearing the news. As for the change in France's attitude, it was because the United States had accepted the plan to supervise armaments for a short period of time, so it dared to make concessions in order to avoid the failure of the Disarmament Conference.

<p>Financial Power Still Held by Americans</p>
<p>National News Agency Washington dispatch - The 19-year military occupation of the Republic of Haiti by the United States will be terminated in one year. All 700 Marines stationed in this black republic will be withdrawn by this day next year. However, most of the financial power will still be managed by the Americans until the Haitian public debt held by the Americans is repaid. According to a statement issued by the State Department today, the U.S. Minister to Haiti, Mr. Armour, has signed an agreement with the Haitian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Regarding the military part, it stipulates: (1) All Marines will be withdrawn within 30 days after October 1, 1934. (2) The Haitian Garde d'Haiti, trained by the U.S. Marines, will be handed over on October 1 to the Haitian generals appointed by the Haitian President. (3) After being requested by Haiti, the United States will send seven military commissioners to train the Haitian Garde d'Haiti and provide advice. (4) The U.S. scientific commissioners will be withdrawn within 30 days after October 1, 1934. Regarding the financial part, it stipulates: (1) The current financial advisor and chief deputy tax collector will be replaced by financial representatives and deputy representatives, whose candidates are assumed to be Americans and are appointed by the Haitian President from those recommended by the U.S. President. (2) These financial representatives will guide customs and tax administration until the approximately 15 million yuan of public debt held by the Americans is repaid. It is estimated that this debt can be repaid by approximately 1944. According to the treaty previously negotiated between the two countries last year, it was subsequently rejected by the Haitian Congress. This agreement is administrative in nature and does not require congressional approval.</p>

Mr. Tinkham may go to Shanghai to inspect the Yangtze River by plane, and then travel to Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, Colombo, Karachi, etc., before taking a plane to Paris. According to Mr. Tinkham, he only stayed in Changchun for one day, so he did not meet with the puppet State Council and Puyi. For this reason, he was unable to form any impressions of the puppet government. Japan is truly the Rome of the East, and its management and colonization talents are not comparable to its military. He was deeply impressed by the fortifications of Harbin. He stayed at the U.S. Consulate there for two days. The consulate was surrounded by iron nets and heavily guarded by Russian guards to prevent robbery and kidnapping. The U.S. consul carries weapons when going in and out. Mr. Tinkham had originally intended to fly to Rehe and take the route through Gubeikou to Peiping, but because Fang Zhenwu's army was active in the area, he changed his plans and took a ship to Tianjin. Because he had received warnings of war, he was deeply surprised by the tranquility of Peiping upon arriving there. He will be staying in Beiping for several more days. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

Arriving directly at the Xiaguan Railway Station, they immediately crossed the Yangtze River and took the 11 o'clock Pupu train north. According to reports, since the outbreak of military conflict in North China, funds have been needed everywhere. Due to the impact of the war, the income of various eastern counties has decreased sharply. In addition, relief and reconstruction efforts after the devastation of war need to be organized and handled urgently. North China, already depleted of resources, is facing the lamentable situation of "draining the pond to catch fish" under the pressure of military and administrative expenses. Recently, President Wang came to Shanghai and devised considerable solutions. Therefore, he rushed to Beiping to reorganize everything. It is said that the government does intend to leave room for Zhen Wu and Ji Hongchang's troops to encourage them to realize their errors. However, because Fang is acting alone and stubbornly, it is difficult to reason with him. Now, fixed steps have been determined to resolve the issue and it will be resolved soon.

<p>Financial Solutions Have Been Discussed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang of the Executive Yuan returned to Nanjing from Hepingmen Station on the morning of the 2nd. According to him, military and administrative expenses in recent years have exceeded the budget by too much, causing financial difficulties. Taking advantage of his vacation, he went to Shanghai to discuss subsidy measures with President Sun, Minister Song, Director Kong, and Chairman Huang. Everyone agreed that the cotton and wheat loans have not yet been fully received in China and must be maintained solely for construction purposes, without any diversion. After several rounds of negotiations, other considerable solutions have been devised and are generally taking shape. Kong Yongzhi is scheduled to fly to Jiangxi within the next few days to seek the opinions of Chairman Jiang. As for Fang and Ji's disturbances in North China, they are local issues that are being resolved step by step by the Beiping Military Sub-Committee and should not be a cause for concern. Chen Jitang's arrival in Shanghai is something he has not heard of and is probably a rumor. The Economic Committee will be established after Finance Minister Song arrives in Nanjing and an inauguration ceremony will be held at the same time. Finance Minister Song is expected to arrive in Nanjing tomorrow. All requests for cotton and wheat loans will be answered separately after a meeting is held. Zeng Zhongming said that he, Minister Song, and President Sun discussed the entire financial problem in Shanghai, conducting thorough discussions on the central government's financial history and how to raise funds. Concrete solutions have also been found for North China's finances. Chairman Huang will not stay in Nanjing but will cross the river north today to reorganize all political affairs in North China. The National Economic Committee will be officially established within this week and will hold its first meeting at the same time. Song will return to Nanjing the day after tomorrow. As for Lachman, the technical liaison officer sent by the League of Nations, he has already passed through Hong Kong and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 2nd, without staying long in Shanghai, he will enter Nanjing to attend the first meeting of the National Economic Committee. As for the powers of the committee, it will be decided after its establishment. He has not heard that the construction projects undertaken by the Ministry of Railways will be under the control of the committee. As far as he knows, the issue of the committee controlling various construction projects has not yet been concretely decided and will be discussed and implemented after the powers are determined.

<p>Ye Chucang Speaks on "Creating Bowls of Rice for the People"</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chucang was invited to speak at the Construction Committee's memorial week on the 2nd, with the title "Creating Bowls of Rice for the People." He briefly stated that state-owned enterprises are intended to benefit the people and should be more effective than private enterprises. However, in the past, state-owned enterprises could only accomplish 20,000 to 30,000 yuan worth of work with 100,000 yuan of funding. Mr. Zhang Jingjiang alone was able to accomplish 300,000 yuan worth of work with 100,000 yuan of funding. The work done by the Construction Committee is to create bowls of rice for the people. Zhang was able to achieve great results with a small amount of funding, which should be known by the government and the whole country. Creating bowls of rice for the people is to enable the people to survive. We seek profit for life, which is to seek a bowl of rice. When there are many people seeking a bowl of rice, conflicts arise in the pursuit of a bowl of rice. It can be said that various events in the world are caused by grabbing bowls of rice, stealing bowls of rice, and smashing bowls of rice. There are very few who truly create bowls of rice for the people. We must be like Mr. Zhang, using a small amount of money to secure bowls of rice for the majority of people.

<h3 id="e75">The Foundation for Zhejiang's Autonomy Has Been Established <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Household Registration Cleared, Organization Completed</p>
<p>Land Reorganized, Security Strengthened</p>
<p>Various Conditions for Autonomy Proceeding One After Another</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), Zhejiang Province formulated and promulgated the village and neighborhood system to prepare for autonomy. At the same time, it established a local autonomy training school to cultivate autonomy talent. By the summer of the 18th year (1929), the village and neighborhood organization was completed. Subsequently, the central government successively promulgated the County Organization Law and its implementation rules, the District Autonomy Implementation Law, and the Township Autonomy Implementation Law, and districts were divided according to law. When the 19th year (1930) began, district offices throughout the province were established, and the preparation and guidance of townships, neighborhoods, and lanes were carried out. By the end of the first half of the 21st year (1932), the autonomous organizations of districts, neighborhoods, townships, and towns throughout the province were completed. Statistics for the entire province of one city and 75 counties: Hangzhou City has 13 districts, 58 neighborhoods, 820 lanes, and 6,129 alleys; the 75 counties have a total of 418 districts, 1,223 towns, 11,245 townships, 173,020 lanes, and 864,086 alleys. This year, the first step of organizational preparation has been completed, and a subsequent autonomy implementation plan has been promulgated, emphasizing the county magistrate's personal promotion of group counseling, and the parallel development of political and economic undertakings. The Provincial Autonomy Preparatory Committee has also been established, and members are currently being appointed and are going to various areas to examine and supervise. The autonomous affairs of districts, townships, and towns are legally prescribed in 21 articles. The completed conditions for autonomy within the scope of autonomy are household registration, land, security, and roads. For readers to understand the work of Zhejiang's autonomy, the reporter will describe the process of household registration investigation, land reorganization, security strengthening, and road construction over the years. However, the road construction item has been mentioned in the reporter's manuscript "Zhejiang's Transportation is Becoming Increasingly Developed," so it will not be detailed.</p>
<p>Household Registration Investigation: Zhejiang Province conducted a temporary household registration investigation in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), counting 4,644,815 households with a population of 20,643,701 (including 11,603,889 males and 9,038,812 females). Subsequently, in the second half of the 19th year (1930), the Civil Affairs Department and the Relief Bureau jointly formulated investigation methods in accordance with the Ministry's promulgated Household Registration Investigation and Statistics Reporting Regulations, ordering the districts, villages, neighborhoods, and public security bureaus to handle it. The investigation results show that the province has 4,605,512 households with a population of 21,249,898 (including 12,037,064 males and 9,212,834 females). By the 21st year (1932), the reorganization of townships, towns, lanes, and alleys throughout the province was completed. As one year has passed, the household registration has also changed. In order to simplify procedures and save expenses, the original investigation forms from the 19th year (1930) were reviewed by household. Currently, some of the forms have been found to contain errors and have been sent back for correction. Apart from those that have not been fully checked, the survey number of 49 counties including the provincial capital and Hangzhou County totaled 2,805,391 households with a population of 12,174,202. Regarding house numbers and door plates, apart from Hangzhou and larger cities, most have not been numbered. In October of the 21st year (1932), when the township and neighborhood systems were about to be completed, the Civil Affairs Department formulated a method, ordering that towns be done first, then townships, in stages. It is expected to be completed by the end of October this year. Personal registration has also been ordered to be piloted as preparation for the implementation of the Household Registration Law.</p>
<p>Land Reorganization: Zhejiang Province established a Land Department and a Land Survey Bureau in the 16th year of the Republic (1927) and began to reorganize land, but they were soon abolished. A Land Section was established in the Civil Affairs Department to oversee the matter. Subsequently, due to difficulties in both funding and talent, a two-pronged approach of addressing the root cause and addressing the symptoms was adopted. Addressing the root cause involved formal scientific measurement, while addressing the symptoms involved measurement using simplified methods after landowners reported or investigations were conducted. Now, the report will first cover addressing the root cause and then addressing the symptoms.</p>
<p>Implementing Land Survey: The Land Bureau was established in the 18th year of the Republic (1929) to implement surveying of the province's large triangulation. In October of the same year, a trial land survey was started in Hangzhou. In July of the 19th year (1930), a trial land survey was started in Hangzhou County. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Land Bureau was abolished, and the measurement team organized by the Civil Affairs Department took over. By the 19th year (1930), the large triangulation network extended from the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou system to the Hangzhou-Ningbo-Taizhou system, and small triangulation was measured in Hangzhou City and County. All household land in Hangzhou City was surveyed and completed. The ground control surveying and household land surveying in Hangzhou County was partially completed. In the 20th year (1931), the entire large triangulation network of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou system was completed, and one-third of the Hangzhou-Ningbo-Taizhou system was completed. Small triangulation surveys continued to be carried out in Wuxing and Deqing counties. Except for the western land of Wuxing and a small area in the east, all were completed. The original map inspection and household land calculation in Hangzhou City were all completed. The ground control surveying in Hangzhou County, except for the Shangyi District, was all surveyed and the household survey and land survey in the northern area were completed. In the 21st year (1932), the large triangulation chains of the Hangzhou-Ningbo-Taizhou system and the Hangzhou-Jinhua-Quzhou system were completed, and the Jintai system triangulation chain was started. Small triangulation was all completed in Wuxing and Deqing counties, and the work was started in Haining, Jiaxing, Pinghu, Haiyan, Changxing, Yuyao, and other counties. Hangzhou City started issuing photos. The ground control surveying and household survey in Hangzhou County, the right map inspection, were all completed, and the issuance of licenses was partially started. The provincial government also discussed the land reorganization implementation plan and decided that the first phase of land survey in Wuxing, Jiaxing, Pinghu, Haiyan, Haining, Changxing, Yuyao, Xiaoshan, and other places, which should start in the 21st year (1932), had all established land survey offices, and personnel were sent by the Civil Affairs Department to guide the process.</p>
<p>Compiling and Sending Maps and Registers: For addressing the symptoms, the reporting had already started in May of the 18th year (1929) and ended in April of the 19th year (1930), and simplified methods were used for investigation and measurement. Subsequently, as the authorities saw that the arrears in land taxes over the years were very large, for the sake of the province and county finances, they advanced the procedures for investigating land. The field map register was incorporated into the Zhejiang Province Land Reorganization Implementation Plan and promulgated in April of the 21st year (1932). First, a trial run was conducted in the first county of the old Hangzhou Prefecture. Hangzhou County, the first county of the old Hangzhou Prefecture, had been surveyed for many days, so Yuhang was changed. In the 21st year (1932), each started a trial run. In Jiaxing, two villages were investigated and 2,200 mu of land was counted, with 211 mu of unreported land found. In Wuxing, two villages were investigated and 5,372 mu of land was counted, with 2,337 mu of land with unreported tax found. In Yuhang, two villages were investigated and 13,835 mu of land was counted, with 963 mu of land with unreported tax found. In Xiushui, one village was investigated and 4,074 mu of land was counted, with 1,687 mu of land with unreported tax found. Other places, such as Linhai, Qu County, Jiande, etc., also found a lot of land with unreported tax. After provincial personnel conducted on-site inspections and confirmed that there were no errors, they were ordered to continue the process. As of now, a total of 2,336,123 mu in 11 counties, including Yuhang, Jiaxing, Wuxing, Yin County, Shaoxing, Lin'an, Jinhua, Qu County, Jiande, Lishui, Yongjia, etc., have been compiled into draft maps or complete maps and registers. The other counties have started piloting district maps.</p>
<p>Conducting Surveys and Measurements: Qu County is combining investigation and measurement. Within the more than 58,000 mu that has been handled, a total of more than 31,000 mu of land with unreported tax has been measured. Yuhang has already started surveying and measuring two villages. Yongjia, Linhai, Lishui, and other counties are also preparing for surveying and measuring. Delineating the boundaries of administrative regions of various counties is also a land administration matter. After the Ministry of the Interior promulgated the Provincial, City, and County Boundary Survey Regulations in June of the 19th year (1930), the Civil Affairs Department ordered a field survey. As of now, 75 surveys have been completed.</p>
<p>Strengthening Security: Zhejiang's water and land police agencies include the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, the Public Security Bureaus of various counties, and the offshore water police bureau, the inland river water police bureau, and the inland river and offshore water police bureau. In the 21st year (1932), they were reorganized into water police detachments.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Police: The number of permanent police in the province was 16,061 in the 19th year (1930), 15,056 in the 20th year (1931), and 15,317 in the 21st year (1932). In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the Civil Affairs Department established a police academy and a police training center. In addition to recruiting new students, incumbent bureau chiefs, inspectors, and police chiefs were selected for training over the years. Furthermore, the Civil Affairs Department supervised the opening of permanent police refresher courses in various areas. After police equipment was confiscated by warlords before the 16th year of the Republic (1927), there was a severe shortage. In the 18th year (1929), Liaoning rifles were purchased, but wooden-holster pistols were still insufficient. In the 21st year (1932), quick-firing rifles were acquired from the central government at cost, and more than 1,400 old rifles were repaired and made usable. Police expenses totaled 3.65 million in the 19th year (1930), 3.83 million in the 20th year (1931), and 3.97 million in the 21st year (1932). The water police have been reorganized in accordance with the police team organization since April this year (1932) and have been redeployed for defense.</p>

<h3 id="e77">The Truth About the Capture of Luyi in Southern Henan by Bandits <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Occupied the County Seat for One Day</p>
<p>Fled to Ziziji on the 14th</p>
<p>The capture of Luyi in southern Henan by Huo bandits on September 13 has been reported previously. The following is a detailed account of the capture from a letter from the 52nd Division Special Party Department's Fuxing News Agency:</p>
<p>The bandits of Xiao, Gu, and Huo were severely attacked by the 52nd Division's Peng Brigade and the 13th Cavalry Brigade in Fangji, suffering more than 600 casualties and the death of the bandit leader Gu Dashen. The remnants fled north of Fangji, passing through Shenqiu County and reaching Luyi County. After learning that the county seat was unprepared, they first sneaked a few men into the city. When the bandits arrived near the county seat, they responded from the inside and outside, first disarming all the sentries at the city gate. Most of them then entered the city, rushing straight to the county government. When the bandits arrived at the county government, County Magistrate Xu Xizhi was fast asleep, unaware of the situation. He was pulled up from his sleep and only realized the true situation later. There was nothing he could do. The bandits occupied the county seat for one day and fled to Ziziji on the night of the 14th. They were again surrounded and attacked by the 52nd Division's Peng Brigade and the 2nd Regiment 14th Cavalry Brigade. The bandits fled to the northwest. In this battle, more than 100 hand-held machine guns, pistols, and rifles were seized, more than 700 bandits were killed, and more than 100 horses were captured. More than 1,000 hostages, including the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, the director of the Education Bureau, the director of the Salt Affairs Inspection Bureau, male and female students, and civilians, were rescued and handed over to the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce to take back to Luyi. County Magistrate Xu Xizhi was also released by the bandits in this battle. It was also learned that the original security team of Luyi County had five squadrons. Apart from two squadrons deployed in various districts, there were still three squadrons responsible for the defense of the city. The bandits could have been resisted, but County Magistrate Xu of the county ignored the bandit situation, did not check household registrations, did not send detectives, did not contact various parties, and did not issue the ammunition he received from the Sui Appeasement Headquarters to the security team. As a result, when the bandits approached the city, no shots were fired, no one was injured, and they safely entered the city. The bandits treated County Magistrate Xu with great respect and even gave him a good horse and some travel expenses when they released him in Ziziji. (September 19)</p>

<h3 id="e80">Rice Shop Bankruptcy Causes Debt Disputes <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangyin Qingyang Shen Changyuan Rice Shop, established by the brothers Shen Jinqing, Shen Liangshi, and Shen Jizhi, was a large-scale operation. However, it suddenly went bankrupt the year before last, owing over 200,000 yuan in drafts to local Yongji Run, Ruichang Run, Fuyuan, and other money shops. After the money shops sued the Jiangyin County Government, a judgment was issued on February 26th of this year, ordering the three brothers, Shen Jinqing, etc., to be jointly responsible for repaying the principal and interest of the debt, totaling 200,670 yuan. The shops were planning to request the auction of the fields and properties that had been seized provisionally. Unexpectedly, Shen Jinqing and others appealed to the High Court, which rejected the appeal. It is said that they have appealed to the Supreme Court, hoping to delay the matter and obstruct the creditors. The Shen Changyuan Rice Shop, which has already been sealed, continues to operate as usual, and the rent for the leased fields is still being collected. The money shops believe that the Shens are deliberately trying to evade their debts, which is extremely hateful. Therefore, they sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to forward the matter to the Ministry and the Yuan for a swift dismissal to maintain financial stability. After receiving the letter, the County Chamber of Commerce, considering the decline in the commercial market in recent years and the lack of financial flexibility in the market, and that the shop's huge debt has been delayed for too long and the shop even removed the official seals, showing contempt for the law, specially petitioned the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Supreme Court yesterday, requesting that the shop's appeal be swiftly dismissed and that the Jiangyin County Government be ordered to immediately execute the auction of the fields and properties that have already been provisionally seized.</p>

<p>Xu Achuan, a resident of No. 141 White Stone Temple, Pengjiabu, Hangzhou, makes a living weaving silk and has some savings. One day at about 4 PM, six robbers wearing blue short-sleeved shirts and trousers suddenly came, each holding a handgun and a sharp blade, and knocked on the door to enter. Two robbers stood guard at the door, while the other four robbers thoroughly searched the premises. They left after an hour, taking with them two thousand taels of white silk, five bolts of large silk, 122 silver dollars, and a pair of gold earrings, resulting in a loss of more than one thousand yuan. The robbers fled toward Xuanjiabu on Hanghai Road. The Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital received the news and sent telegrams to the various sub-bureaus and outposts to conduct a thorough search. Yesterday (the 2nd) at 6 AM, the case was solved at the home of Zhang Amao at No. 25 Miaodong Village, Qiaosi Township. The original stolen goods, 125 taels of white silk, were recovered. One robber, Liu Jinkui, was arrested, along with two suspects, Zhang Amao and Zhang Lu's family. Liu confessed that he was from Xiaoshan and was a long-term worker at Zhang Amao's home.

<h3 id="e93">Letter <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news item in the "Local News" column of your September 24th issue concerning the petition of the County Party members to the Province. Much of it is inconsistent with the facts. After investigation, the transfer of the County Party members has already been regulated by the Provincial Party Department. The County Representative Assembly was held on September 15th. The County Party Department did not receive any clear instructions and therefore had no reason to hold it without authorization. As for the petition of the County Party members to the Province, much of it is also inaccurate. Tingjie personally did not receive any reprimands from anyone. It seems that your local news reporter, in reporting this news, was standing on a particular position, which is detrimental to the value of the news. I am specially requesting that you correct it. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Zhang Tingjie</p>

<p>Hua County's Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Districts Hit Hardest</p>
<p>Request Approval from Ministry of Communications for Free Telegrams in Disaster Areas</p>
<p>The joint association of various Shanghai charities for raising emergency relief funds for the Yellow River flood disaster received a telegram yesterday from Mingdao and Zhang Zepu, relief workers in Henan Province, reporting on the disaster relief efforts and requesting that the Ministry of Communications be requested to approve free telegrams in the disaster areas. The original text is as follows: "Dear members, I have sent two telegrams after arriving in Bian, which should have reached you. Master Hongsan is staying in the province waiting for funds and contacting various matters. Zepu and Dao, together with the relief workers, rushed to Hua County on the 25th. The territory of the county is divided into ten districts. The fifth, sixth, and seventh districts were the hardest hit. They are now departing in groups, visiting the disaster areas in person, and bringing the prepared disaster-affected household registers to conduct on-site investigations and distribute aid separately so that the people can receive real benefits and the funds are not wasted, so as not to fail the trust of the benefactors. The six relief workers, Ma Shushan, Wei Lengwei, Chen Hairu, Zhang Chen, Zhang Qixian, and Hu Hanwen, along with the two monks Zhiguang and Zhengbo from the Henan Buddhist Association, and layperson Wang Yixuan, rushed to the disaster area in Hua County. This letter is prepared and submitted for your review. Also, the issued free telegram license states that it is to be sent from Kaifeng. If it is in other counties, it will be restricted. If a telegram is required for important matters, it is necessary to travel thousands of miles to and from the provincial capital, which is both costly and arduous, and it is very inconvenient. It is requested that this association request the Ministry of Communications to approve its universal use in the disaster areas to facilitate progress. This is the prayer. Mingdao and Zhang Zepu, respectfully."</p>

<p>Mayor Wu assumed the additional position of acting commander. Because he gave notice that there would be no ceremony, it was only during the memorial week for Premier Sun Yat-sen at the command headquarters at 10 AM yesterday that the chairman, Chief of Staff Zhang Xiang, introduced the new commander to the entire staff, and then Wu gave a speech announcing his assumption of office. Finally, Zhang Xiang and the new commander, Wu Tiecheng, gave speeches successively.</p>

<p>Chairman Zhang Xiang said in his address, "Mayor Wu of Shanghai is now the acting commander of the Songhu Garrison Command. Mayor Wu has a long history with the Party and the country, and he has also held important positions in the military, which you all know very well. During the January 28th Incident, Mayor Wu paid close attention to our military advice and gave us a lot of assistance. Therefore, in the future, you should all strictly abide by Mayor Wu's orders and work hard without slacking off. I will now introduce the new commander to you."</p>

<p>Wu, the acting commander, then gave a speech: "Chief of Staff, honored guests, colleagues, I have been ordered by the government to be the acting commander of the Songhu Garrison Command. I did not notify the association or my friends beforehand and only came here to take office during the memorial week ceremony. I am the mayor and the acting commander. In taking office, on behalf of the citizens, I express my gratitude for Commander Dai's past achievements. Shanghai is a major port in the East, and its importance is second to none in the country. During the January 28th Incident and in the two years since, the ability to maintain security during wartime and restore order after the war, allowing the lives of the citizens of this city to quickly return to normal, is all due to the fact that Commander Dai, Chief of Staff Zhang, and all the staff have been responsible and hardworking. These achievements should be remembered by everyone. As mayor, I represented the citizens and expressed my appreciation when Commander Dai left. Now that I have been ordered by the government to be the acting commander, I am deeply ashamed and fearful of my lack of talent and ability. After taking office, I can only follow the precedents and adopt Commander Dai's past good practices and do my best to consolidate Shanghai's security and maintain Shanghai's order."</p>
<h3 id="e109">Zhang and Wu's Instructions <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Finally, acting Chief of Staff Zhang Xiang first gave instructions to all the staff, saying, "After Mayor Wu became the acting commander, he strongly urged me to stay, and I am very grateful. However, due to various reasons, I plan to take a temporary rest. Today, I am taking leave of you all. In addition to working hard, I hope you will not forget my two words: 'Work hard in your position' and 'Specialize in your duties.' These are the words that I have always told you. They are my farewell message to you." Then, Mayor Wu gave instructions, saying, "After I take office, I hope you will all work peacefully and support me with the same spirit that you supported Commander Dai."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Appoint New Staff <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After Wu took office, he went to the commander's office to take up his duties and began to work. He then announced the list of new staff: Chief of Staff Jiang Qun, Adjutant Wen Jiangang, Chief of Staff Luo Weixiong, Chief of Military Law Tao Baichuan, Chief of Administration Song Dazhang, etc., have all been officially announced. Zhu Haishan, Deputy Captain Rui Qingrong, and Peng Bowei have also been internally appointed as Captains of the Detective Team. However, Chief of Staff Luo Weixiong is still in Guangdong Province, and a letter has been sent to notify him. Before he arrives, Wen Jiangang will temporarily act as his agent. Wu Daonan will be the Director of the Office.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Report from Wang Gongjue's Letter to the Support Association Regarding the War Situation, Requesting Assistance <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Wang Gongjue, Commander of the Third Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, recently instructed the communication office stationed in Shanghai from the front lines to present a letter to the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, reporting on the war situation and requesting assistance. The letter reads: "With utmost respect, since the September 18th Incident, our various units have been engaged in anti-Japanese operations. After years of bloody battles, we have suffered significant sacrifices. Currently, the First and Second Columns of our command, numbering approximately 18,000 men, are still stationed in the Rehe-Western area, participating in the recovery of lost territories. However, we are severely lacking in both pay and ammunition, and our supplies are often insufficient. Although the officers and soldiers have endured great hardships, they are still able to persevere and fight bravely. The recent details of our engagements are briefly outlined as follows: On the 25th of this month, five enemy aircraft suddenly appeared to reconnoiter our position at Mojiazi in Rehe-Western area. On the following day at dawn, Binmu Saburo led an artillery regiment to cover the advance of the puppet troops under Chen Tianzhu. Our troops ordered the entire First Column to engage the enemy resolutely, and then dispatched a 500-man broadsword team, along with heavy machine guns, to charge the enemy. Taking advantage of the momentum, we launched a full-scale assault, and the enemy gradually collapsed and retreated. Due to our lack of food and ammunition, we dared not pursue them. In this battle, we captured one Japanese officer named Inoue and three puppet officers. The enemy suffered over 300 casualties, while our own losses were even heavier. The seriously wounded officers and soldiers have been sent to the rear for medical treatment by Adjutant Lai Debiao and others. However, the enemy continues to attack from time to time, not only causing devastation to nearby villages, which is unbearable to witness, but also resulting in numerous casualties among our troops, which is truly painful to speak of. What troubles us most is that the weather is gradually turning cold, and many of our soldiers still lack cotton clothing. Combined with the shortage of food and ammunition, we are in a state of extreme anxiety. We earnestly implore you all to find a way to provide relief, so that the officers and soldiers at the front can muster their remaining courage to fulfill their patriotic aspirations with their blood. If you grant us your guidance, please send it to the communication office stationed at No. 410, North Lane, Cihou, Hartung Road, Shanghai, for forwarding, as our various units are currently engaged in battle at the front and have no fixed address." With utmost respect, this is specially presented to the gentlemen of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, including Elder Zi, Elder Jing, Elder Shao, and Elder Hui. Wang Gongjue, Commander of the Third Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, and Yang Xianfu, Chief of General Staff, along with all officers and soldiers, respectfully submit this on September 26th.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Expansion of the Electricity Workers' Strike <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Workers at Both the New and Old Factories Began a General Work Stoppage Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Dagongshe reports that the labor dispute involving the work stoppage of workers at the new factory of the Shanghai Electric Power Company has not been resolved due to the company's persistent attitude. Over 800 workers at the old factory also began a work stoppage yesterday morning in response, and the labor unrest is becoming increasingly serious. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Old Factory Responds to Work Stoppage After the workers at the Yangshupu New Factory of the Electric Power Company declared a work stoppage on the 29th, they were refused entry to the factory the next morning, and the company's attitude remained strong. To show their support, the workers at the old factory, after deliberation by the work stoppage committee, decided that all 800+ workers would also respond and join the work stoppage yesterday morning. It was learned in advance that the factory would similarly refuse entry, so to avoid conflicts with the factory and other unfortunate incidents, they will not enter the factory for the time being. In total, there are over 2,000 workers at the two factories. Except for the power generation section, which continues to operate as usual, the work in all other departments has completely stopped.</p>
<p>Promulgation of Work Stoppage Discipline The work stoppage committee, in order to regulate the workers' actions, issued the following work stoppage discipline yesterday: (1) During the work stoppage, the work stoppage committee is the highest authority; (2) All workers at the new and old factories should absolutely obey the orders and directions of the work stoppage committee; (3) During the work stoppage, all workers should strictly maintain order and not act outside the rules; (4) During the work stoppage, it is forbidden to fabricate rumors and disrupt people's minds; (5) During the work stoppage, all workers should patiently wait for the resolution of the dispute and not deliberately panic or shrink back; (6) During the work stoppage, all workers should not go to the factory to watch; (7) During the work stoppage, each worker should go to the designated location to inquire about news and not believe rumors; (8) Workers who do not comply with the above discipline will be considered traitors; (9) Those who are willing to be running dogs or traitors will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Preparedness of the Two Factories Since the workers at the new and old factories announced a general work stoppage, the factory, in order to prevent workers from causing trouble, had the Dongting Road gate of the Yangshupu New Factory in Pudong guarded by multiple Chinese and Indian police officers. Other factory gates entering and exiting Yangshupu Road were also guarded by two Chinese police officers each, with strict security measures. However, since the workers implemented the work stoppage, they did not enter the factory yesterday because the factory refused them entry. The workers at the old factory also went to the Municipal General Labor Union yesterday morning to hold a meeting, and the order was excellent.</p>
<p>White Russians Begin Work After the workers at the old factory on Feilun Road joined the work stoppage yesterday morning, the company, fearing that the dispute would be prolonged and disrupt power generation, immediately hired over 50 White Russians to enter the factory in preparation for replacement. In the Yangshupu New Factory, Russian workers were assigned to various parts, such as the furnace room, internal and external coppersmith rooms, cold working room, blacksmith room, coal hoisting room, and wire picking room, to start work yesterday. According to Zhuang Zhishun, a worker in the power generation room, who spoke to a Dagongshe reporter, although the factory hired Russian workers to replace them, in fact, the White Russians lacked experience and needed two people to replace one Chinese worker. Currently, the power generation section has not yet received orders from the work stoppage committee, so it is still working as usual to maintain the current. If the factory does not realize this, the over 200 power generation workers will definitely go on strike automatically to achieve final victory. At that time, even if the factory hires White Russians to replace them, it will be difficult to avoid problems in maintaining power generation.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Party and Government for Assistance The labor unions of the water and electricity industries in the four districts dispatched representatives Ni Tianfu, Dong Shengquan, Chen Youfa, and others yesterday morning to petition the municipal government. Because Mayor Wu was inaugurated as the garrison commander yesterday, all the responsible persons of the departments went to participate, and no one received them. They then went to the municipal party headquarters to petition, and Dai Youheng of the People's Movement Department received them and promised to consult with the standing committee and then coordinate with the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate. Finally, they went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau General Labor Union to make the same petition, requesting assistance. Their petition is as follows: A petition is hereby submitted by representatives, requesting your review and approval, and that you grant us assistance to uphold justice and promote fairness. The members of our union, the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, have been subjected to oppression under the oppression of imperialism. Since June of last year, the company has repeatedly dismissed large numbers of workers and refused to pay the meritorious service funds transferred from the former Public Works Department. Their oppression of the workers has reached its extreme. This time, when the Hua directors were mediating on the dismissal of four workers, Ni Wenfu, Pan Genlin, Zhang Caisheng, Chen Baogen, and others, the company authorities took advantage of the situation and dismissed three workers, Dai Renheng, Xue A'bao, and Yin Binggen, on the pretext of laziness without evidence. Their intention to undermine the labor movement is very obvious. All the workers could no longer bear it and had no choice but to endure the pain of a work stoppage. However, considering that electricity is a public utility and relates to social order, which is extremely important, we still maintain power generation, implying the intention of maintaining social order while urging the capitalists to realize their error. However, the company authorities, relying on their imperialist power, are behaving arrogantly. The future outcome is difficult to predict, and a more serious dispute may arise as a result. The company shall bear the responsibility for this. Therefore, we are specially writing this document and sending Yang Zhaogeng and others to state the facts. We humbly request your office to quickly adopt effective measures and grant us a review and decision, which would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully submitted to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Zhong Si's Mediation is Ineffective The electricity workers petitioned Zhong Si, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, last Saturday. Zhong received them and promised to consult with the Electric Power Company, instructing them to go there yesterday to await a reply. The workers still sent representatives Zhu Haosheng, Zhang Changsheng, Bao Defu, Zhu A'fu, and others yesterday morning to meet with Huidekui. Huidekui instructed them to go in the afternoon. The representatives went again at 4:30 PM to await a reply. Huidekui, representing Zhong Si, formally replied to the workers, stating that Zhong had consulted with the company authorities, but the company's attitude was quite insistent and there was still no concrete solution. He hoped that all the workers would resume work immediately to avoid expanding the dispute. The representatives returned to the union to report to the workers.</p>
<p>The Labor Union Writes to the Public Works Department The labor union of the water and electricity industries in the four districts wrote to the Public Works Department yesterday, saying, "With utmost respect, our union members used to serve in the electrical department of your bureau. There was sincere cooperation between us, and your bureau was also able to sympathize with the workers' pain and treat them equally. The workers were able to have a stable life and worked diligently, so there were no accidents. After the Shanghai Electric Power Company took over the electrical department, it turned this public utility into a private profit-making organization, and frequently oppressed our hard-working workers. In the three years since the takeover, it has dismissed more than 500 workers and destroyed the benefits that your bureau had established for the workers. In April of this year, it dismissed four workers, Ni Wenfu, and others, without reason. Although our union repeatedly requested the enthusiastic mediation of Hua directors Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Yuan Ludeng, and Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the company authorities dismissed workers Xue A'bao and Dai Renheng, who had served for many years, on the pretext of laziness, and also dismissed Qiu Binggen because he was sick and took more than three days of leave. They also refused to pay the 5% meritorious service fund stipulated by the former electrical department of your bureau, claiming that the company had the right to arbitrarily change the regulations. We believe that using the words 'laziness without evidence' and 'overdue sick leave' as excuses for dismissal is not only without legal basis but also contrary to human sentiment. We fear that no other country in the world has such regulations. Moreover, it is even more unreasonable to refuse to pay the meritorious service fund that the workers have accumulated over the years with their sweat and blood. All the members of our union believe that the company's actions are unreasonable and illegal. Therefore, we have had no choice but to endure the pain of a work stoppage. However, considering the importance of the electricity business to society, we still maintain power generation, and our internal organization is strict, and our actions are orderly. We will never act inappropriately. Our union and your bureau have an old relationship as loyal supporters, and we dare to ask you to take a fair stand and grant us assistance. We are anxiously awaiting your response."</p>
<p>The Company Issues a Statement The Shanghai Electric Power Company issued an English statement, which is excerpted and translated as follows: "At 8:00 AM on the 29th of last month, the workers at the Yangshupu New Factory of our company suddenly went on strike. The factory had not received any prior notice. Our factory has always treated workers with tolerance. This sudden strike, which affects social safety, was unexpected. Before that, the workers had not made any representations to the managers of our factory. Even on the evening of the 29th of this month, the factory was still isolated from news and had not received any letters from the workers stating the reasons for the strike. Our company believes that electricity is a public utility and has a great responsibility to society. Therefore, we have repeatedly advised workers not to strike without reason, which would endanger the local area, and for the safety of all workers, we declare that labor and management should not strike arbitrarily until there is no solution to any negotiations. This time, the workers suddenly went on strike, neither declaring it clearly nor discussing solutions with the factory. The responsibility for this to the local area and the public must be borne by</p>
<p>The Citywide Union Declares The Shanghai Postal Union and over ninety other labor unions issued a declaration of support yesterday for the electricity workers' work stoppage, saying, "International capitalists, relying on their abundant capital and the unequal treaties as their protection, are not only expanding their economic power in our country but also repeatedly oppressing our hard-working workers. Past facts have been recognized by people across the country. The workers of the American Shanghai Electric Power Company work hard and contribute their blood and sweat to international capitalists, working like cattle and horses. What they earn is only enough to keep them warm and fed, and they spend the whole year hoping to get 5% of their pension. Now, the company authorities have disregarded their conscience and dismissed workers one after another on the pretext of slow business, and they also intend to swallow up the pension that the former Public Works Department had agreed to pay. The workers of the factory, under this iron heel, have repeatedly groaned and cried out, but have failed to move the company authorities to pity them. Moreover, they despise our party and government organs and refuse the mediation of our Hua directors, resulting in a tangled dispute that has not been resolved. They regard our Chinese workers as cattle and horses and treat our Chinese people as nothing. This is truly outrageous. This time, the workers of the new and old factories have implemented a work stoppage to fight strongly against international capitalists for the sake of national status and the dignity of the workers. This struggle is not comparable to ordinary labor-management disputes, nor can it be compared to other labor unrest. Our union, from a national standpoint and out of solidarity with the same class, vows to do its utmost to provide support. We hope that people from all walks of life will rise up and provide strong assistance. Then the nation will be fortunate, and the workers will be fortunate. This is our declaration.

<h3 id="e122">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Public Works Department, Asking it Not to Approve the Telephone Company's Price Increase <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Protect the Public Interest Based on the Contract</p>
<p>How Can They Request a Price Increase If the Design is Poor?</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Public Works Department yesterday, asking it not to approve the telephone company's price increase. The original letter is recorded below: "With utmost respect, recently, Shanghai newspapers published news that the Shanghai Telephone Company will again increase its prices. As soon as the Public Works Department of the Public Concession approves it, it will announce the measures. This is deeply shocking. According to the contract signed between the company and your bureau, the company may increase prices after the automatic switchboard is completed and the number of Ansen's report is increased. It may not increase prices again within three years. That is to say, even if the company is currently suffering losses, it should be restricted by the contract and may not request a price increase arbitrarily. Your bureau also has the responsibility to protect the public interest based on the contract and may not approve it arbitrarily. Moreover, the reason for the company's business losses, according to a careful investigation by the public, is actually due to its poor design. For example, the number of lines actually in use is only more than 40,000, while there are 100,000 lines of equipment. This means that the estimate is too broad. For an enterprise of more than 20 million taels, only one-quarter of the capital is raised, and the rest is raised by issuing bonds and borrowing to carry out activities, resulting in increased debt interest. All these inappropriate handling situations cannot require the public to increase their burden to compensate for them. Your bureau seeks the interests of the citizens in the concession, not the interests of a private company. The citizens, in view of the approval of the telephone company's price increase last year, believe that this matter has become a serious problem. How your bureau will handle this matter has caused a lot of anxiety among the citizens and has to give its advice in advance. To the Public Works Department of the Public Concession."</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan, all companies whose capital was previously denominated in taels have converted to national currency. However, when applying for registration of the change after implementation, many difficulties often arise. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to avoid these difficulties, has formulated three alternative methods and ordered the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to follow them. After receiving the order, the Social Affairs Bureau, in addition to following them, also ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify them to follow. The details of the methods are as follows: (1) The total amount of company shares converted from taels to yuan, calculated at a fixed rate of 715, with 10,000 taels converted to 14,000 yuan, should be submitted by the competent authority for filing, without the need to apply for registration of the change; (2) The amount of each share converted at a fixed rate of 715, with 10 taels converted to 14 yuan, should be submitted by the competent authority for filing, without the need to apply for registration of the change; (3) Reissuing shares, or adding a stamp to the shares to indicate the change, is up to the company's discretion.</p>

<h3 id="e126">After the Merger of the Two Exchanges, All Gold Brokers Oppose It <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Goods Exchange merged its securities section with the China Merchants Securities Exchange, the gold section had repeatedly consulted with the Gold Exchange. Due to the relationship between the rights of both parties and the difficulty in controlling the brokers, the merger had not been resolved. Recently, Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Zhang Xiaolin took on the role of mediators and proposed that the names of the original two exchanges be canceled and a new exchange be jointly established to be the only financial market in Shanghai. The capital amount was set at 2 million, which would be contributed equally by both parties, with the principle of equal reciprocity. This was agreed upon by Yu Qiaqing, the chairman of the Goods Exchange, and Xu Pusheng, the chairman of the Gold Exchange. The contract was signed on the 24th of last month to resolve the case. However, all 139 gold exchange brokers believed that the gold exchange chairman Xu Pusheng had not consulted them beforehand, believing that this move not only violated the principle of merger but also damaged the interests of all brokers. A general meeting was immediately convened, and a unanimous resolution was passed to oppose it. In addition to sending nine representatives to negotiate with Chairman Xu and explain everything to the mediators, they also telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to appeal for remedy. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Telegram to the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Gold Exchange Brokers Association of Shanghai telegraphed the Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: "Chen, the Minister of Industry, it is our pleasure to obey the order to merge the two exchanges, the Gold Exchange and the Goods Exchange, within a specified period, as it concerns government orders. However, Chairman Xu of our exchange did not consult all brokers beforehand and directly negotiated specific conditions with the Goods Exchange to contribute equally and reorganize, and also jointly telegraphed your ministry with the Goods Exchange. This matter not only violates the merger order, but the result is that it greatly damages the interests of all of us. According to legal facts, it does not comply. A meeting has been held to deny it unanimously. We publicly elected representatives to urgently negotiate with Chairman Xu and dare to quickly declare to your ministry to ensure that our original rights and interests are not subject to unexpected losses. We are deeply grateful. In addition to submitting a detailed statement separately, we will telegraph in advance and await your instructions. The Shanghai Gold Exchange Brokers Association, all 138 people, including Wang Jiafu, Tian Derun, Zhan Liansheng, Ge Zhifen, Zhang Zhusun, Wang Yingchang, You Shuren, etc., respectfully bow."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Negotiation Situation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, nine representatives of the Gold Exchange Brokers Association, including Ge Zhifen, Tian Derun, and Zhang Zhusun, went to the Gold Exchange on Jiujiang Road Bund to meet with Chairman Xu Pusheng to handle the negotiations. Chairman Xu received them. First, the representatives stated their intentions, briefly saying that Chairman Xu had signed a contract with the Goods Exchange without consulting all the brokers regarding the merger of the Gold Exchange and the Goods Exchange, and the conditions negotiated greatly damaged the interests of the brokers. The brokers found it difficult to approve this merger method and requested that the original interests of the brokers be effectively taken care of to comply with the law. Then, Chairman Xu replied, expressing complete acceptance of the representatives' opinions and saying that the original interests of the brokers would be effectively taken care of. If the brokers had any opinions on the existing merger method, he would do his best to ensure that it did not violate the order and did not harm the original interests of the brokers. The representatives were satisfied and returned. In the afternoon, the representatives went to Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin, the two mediators, to explain everything and request sympathy and assistance. It is heard that Du and Zhang have agreed to convene the relevant parties again for further discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Important Notice <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Gold Exchange Brokers Association issued an important notice saying, "We have learned that the two exchanges, the Gold Exchange and the Goods Exchange, have repeatedly received orders from the government to merge within a specified period, which is a government order, and we are happy to comply. However, Chairman Xu of our exchange did not consult all of us beforehand and disregarded our original rights and interests, and directly negotiated specific conditions with the representatives of the Goods Exchange on September 24 to reorganize with the method of equal contribution, and directly telegraphed the Ministry of Industry with the Goods Exchange. This move not only violates the principle of merger, but the result is that it greatly damages the interests of all of us. (Omission in the middle) Therefore, we issue an important notice that until a proper and fair method is negotiated by this association, this association does not recognize any actions taken by Chairman Xu that harm the rights and interests of all members of this association. We hereby solemnly declare."</p>

<p>The Drug Store Dock Resumes Shipping on the 5th</p>
<p>The drug industry dock workers in this city declared a strike on the 10th of last month in protest against the Shantou merchants, Hong Taixing, and others, for undermining the wharf labor standards. The strike has lasted for nearly a month. The Drug Material Industry Association, because the strike of the dock workers has affected the operations of various firms, specially convened both parties for mediation the day before yesterday. It was immediately decided that the Shantou merchants should still handle matters in accordance with the wharf labor regulations set by the dock workers, and a resolution was announced. All dock workers are approved to resume shipping on the 5th of this month. The Drug Store Association has submitted a request to the Party and government agencies to proceed with the cancellation of the case and case handling procedures.</p>

<p>If Unavoidable, First Request Mediation from the Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association yesterday issued a notice to all members, saying, "Dear members, according to a letter from member Zhang Henghai, the number of members in our association has been increasing in recent years, the rule of law has been promoted, and talents have emerged, which is gratifying. However, members have forgotten their agency status, benefited from others, and attacked each other, even publishing it in newspapers, causing social criticism, and scandals have emerged endlessly, which is regrettable and hateful. Lawyers may also notify the parties to terminate their entrustment for legal acts they want to promise. Article 16 of the Lawyers' Regulations has already clearly stipulated this. If the opposing lawyer is also an agent, then they are both qualified as agents. They should be happy to shake hands and exchange greetings, and do their best for their clients. They can engage in legal disputes, right and wrong, but why involve irrelevant matters outside the case, add fabrications to the agent, attack arbitrarily, or hide behind the scenes, instruct the parties to do so, or act as an accomplice, joining the vortex, disregarding the parties' true goals, and not hesitating to use innuendo to attack colleagues who protect human rights. According to legal human feelings and lawyer ethics, this is absolutely inappropriate. Even our provisional rules clearly prohibit this. Our members believe that the bad trend has started and is even worse now. If we do not quickly seek to eliminate it and let it happen again and again, the impact will not only make the attackers happy and lose their personality, but also the overall members and the future of the rule of law will inevitably suffer adverse consequences. With a member's heart feeling dangerous, they have to inform. They specially propose to send a letter to all members advising them not to attack each other. If it is absolutely necessary, they should first send a letter to the Executive Supervisory Committee of this association to hold a fair mediation. If the mediation fails and the dispute continues, they should try to prevent the wrong party from proceeding with their illegal acts and send a letter to the Executive Supervisory Committee members to promptly discuss whether it is appropriate to implement it. It has been submitted to the Executive Supervisory Committee for discussion and resolution. All members should be notified to check and file the case. Correspond accordingly and hope that your members will check and act accordingly."</p>

<p>Chen Hongyuan, the head of Guanling Township in the 7th District of Yin County, sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, saying, "To the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, with respect, our township is located in the Yinjiangqiao area of Yin County, surrounded by mountains on all sides, with barren land and poor people. Since the mountain flood in the 10th year of the Republic of China destroyed roads, we were grateful to the elders of your association for donating generously to provide disaster relief and restore the old appearance. The villagers have been praising it to this day. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 p.m. on September 17th of this year, a hurricane and torrential rain replayed the strange disaster. The pond embankments, roads, and bridges were all washed away, and the flood flooded, almost turning into a swamp. The most severely affected was Xueyan'ao, because the village pond embankments and roads along the stream were all washed away. The cost of urgent repair is estimated to be more than 5,000 yuan. Secondly, the left and right lines of Dongnan Liangken. The left line road was less damaged, but all the bridges collapsed. The right line was low-lying, and there were not many bridges and roads along the stream. The estimated repair cost is about 3,000 yuan. Again, the roads along the stream in Shanshang and Jia'ao were also collapsed a lot, with an estimated repair cost of more than 800 yuan. If the main road is along the Ginkgo tree under Wu Jia'ao and other places, they are fortunate to escape the disaster, but the collapse of walls is no less than other villages. However, because of the continuous autumn rain after the disaster, the rice seedlings have sprouted, which has become a disaster. Therefore, we sincerely ask the elders of your association to generously donate and provide assistance to the victims. We will be extremely grateful."</p>

<p>The Upper Reaches Office of the World Red Swastika Society received a letter from the World Red Swastika Society yesterday, saying that they received a telegram from the Jinan and Xi'an Swastika Branches yesterday, saying that after the Yellow River flood, hundreds of thousands of victims were exposed to the wind and dew, which was unbearable to see. In the blink of an eye, winter is coming, and relief is especially needed. They requested to quickly raise funds for relief. It is heard that the General Society is currently convening a meeting to plan winter relief for implementation. The two telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram 1: "To the World Red Swastika Society in Peiping, the Shaanxi disaster has been going on for too long, and the people are in deep distress. The suffering is indescribable. However, the Shaanxi disaster is severe, and relief should be given priority. The way to provide relief is to supplement wheat seeds and provide winter relief. The time to plant wheat has arrived, and the time for winter relief is also approaching quickly. Preparations cannot be delayed. We are gradually weak and cannot make up for the difficulties. We are usually exhausted in maintaining the expenses of the society and promoting charity. We always feel difficult. The winter relief is urgent, and we cannot afford it. If we do not borrow weight from the same boat and resolutely assist, it will be difficult to start. We have repeatedly discussed and summarized the situation of the Shaanxi disaster, listed the main points, and telegraphed to all branches and societies on the day to request assistance. We hereby telegraph again and beg you to consider the devastation of Shaanxi and that the people of other provinces suffer no less suffering. The survivors are in danger and are extremely pitiful. Please check the support telegram of this society and vigorously assist to achieve success, so that the disaster victims in Shaanxi can have wheat to plant and winter relief can be realized. This is not only grateful to the disaster victims, but also an infinite merit for the development of Western charity. Xi'an Swastika Branch bows respectfully."</p>
<p>Telegram 2: "To the China General Society of the Red Swastika Society in Peiping, although the urgent relief period has passed, hundreds of thousands of victims in more than ten counties are exposed to the wind and dew. How can we bear the bone-piercing golden wind? Moreover, winter is coming soon, and we must set up cotton clothing and porridge factories. However, the land is vast and the disaster is severe. We hope that all Swastika societies and charitable organizations will continue to work hard and actively raise funds to save these disaster victims who are waiting to die. Jinan Red Swastika Branch bows respectfully."</p>

It specialized in retail and wholesale to various places in this city and other cities. The business was very developed and profitable. In addition to daily expenses, Zhan and others divided all the income among themselves. Because the matter was not kept secret and the spoils were not distributed evenly, it was discovered by Li Xiaobao and Fang Lingen, the investigation leaders of the Second District of the Public Security Bureau. They reported the information to Captain Lu and Li, the head of the Second District in charge. The team dispatched Zhang Kun, Jin Yushan, Yang Bingsheng, Shi Chunlin, Wang Yingliang, Gu Rusheng, Cheng Peizhang, and other large numbers of investigators and patrol officer Zhou Zhicheng, fully armed, to secretly surround No. 9 Shundeli, Huining Road, at midnight yesterday.

<p>There are over one hundred species in total.</p>
<p>Never before seen in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Arriving at the port this afternoon.</p>
<p>The German Hagenbeck Circus is world-renowned. Besides wild animals, the troupe also has a large number of marine animals, all of which can perform. This time, they came from Germany to the Far East to perform, first to Japan, then to China, and then to India. The troupe has over one hundred land and sea beasts. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The situation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai after Performing in Japan: The German Hagenbeck Circus is very famous in Europe and America. This time, coming to the Far East to perform, they first arrived in Yokohama, Japan, and then in Kobe and other ports, performing for about two months. On September 2nd, due to a strong wind, the troupe's tent was blown down, causing a major panic about wild animals escaping. The Hagenbeck troupe has now finished performing in the Orient and has taken a steamer from Japan to Shanghai. They will perform in Shanghai for forty-two days before going to India to perform.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Handles Everything: The troupe's trip to the Far East for performances was pre-arranged with Jardine Matheson, who agreed to manage everything in China and Japan. Therefore, when departing from Germany, all the troupe's performers, wild animals, etc., traveled directly to Yokohama on Jardine Matheson's "Saarland" steamer. Now, coming to Shanghai, Jardine Matheson's giant steamer "Duisburg" transported all the troupe's animals and personnel from Japan to Shanghai and also handled animal import, performance affairs, and various advertising matters in Shanghai. Preparations have been completed in recent days. The theater is located on the open space opposite the Dahua Hotel.</p>
<p>The Beasts Arrive in Shanghai Today: The wild animals in the Hagenbeck troupe, including tigers, lions, zebras, leopards, deer, polar bears, black bears, etc., are divided into thirty-two large carts, with each cart further divided into several cages. In addition, there are thirty-one large horses, fifteen small horses, five giant elephants, six camels, and another four guanacos. There are also twenty intelligent dogs. Furthermore, there are many marine animals, such as seals and sea tigers, as well as a type of seabird. The ostriches and various beasts are transported using nine motorized vehicles and twenty-six non-motorized vehicles, as well as thirty-two large boxes. All the performers, props, etc., are transported from Japan by Jardine Matheson's "Duisburg" steamer and are expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon, disembarking at the Kung Wo Hong Wharf.</p>
<p>Scheduled Performance Dates: The troupe plans to rest for three days after arriving in Shanghai, using this time to set up the theater. The official premiere is scheduled for the 7th of this month, with performances scheduled for six weeks, a total of forty-two days. After the Shanghai performances, Jardine Matheson will transport the troupe to Mumbai, India, for performances before returning home. Although the arrival of the troupe's animals in Shanghai today is for performances, the Jianghai Customs, for strict preventive measures, has ordered the troupe to first pay a deposit of 20,000 yuan. This fee will be returned when they leave Shanghai after the performances. If there are any sales of animals, import duties will be levied according to regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Murder Case Arises from a Brawl Over Fishing Nets <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Wang Shengren Beats Wei Shengsheng to Death</p>
<p>Wang Shengren, a fisherman from Zhenjiang, was laying nets to catch fish at the Nanjing Road wharf on the Huangpu River on the night of the 9th of last month. Coincidentally, his colleagues, Wei Shengsheng, Wei Rongsheng, Wei’s sister Cai Wei, and clan member Wei Maojian, all from Pudong, were also casting nets in the river at the same location. Wang, wanting to get ahead, moved the nets to a different location, hoping to catch more fish. Wei Shengsheng felt that Wang’s irregular competitive tactics were unacceptable and confronted him. This started with a verbal argument and escalated into a physical fight. Wei Shengsheng was punched in the lower back. Rongsheng and others intervened to break up the fight. At the time, Shengsheng did not feel any pain. However, the next morning, his injuries suddenly worsened. He rushed to his sister Cai Wei's house at 614 Miller Road in the American Settlement to tell her what happened. She sent him to the Renji Hospital, where doctors immediately administered treatment, but it was impossible to save him. He died from his injuries. The police station took the body to the forensic examination office on Fieland Road for an official autopsy. They ordered the body to be prepared for burial and also launched an investigation to apprehend the murderer and bring him to justice. Last Saturday, Geng Debiao, a detective from the General Police Station, and detective Ni Jiaxin learned that Wang Shengren was hiding in the Nanshi area. They went to the fish market on Jiangyin Street to apprehend Wang. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Presiding Judge Qian Hongye conducted the preliminary hearing. Attorney Qian Xunjiu from the police station presented the case. Wei Rongsheng and others were present to testify. When questioned, the defendant only admitted to the argument and denied punching Wei Shengsheng. The court stated that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered the defendant to be detained pending further questioning.</p>

<p>Regarding the scheduled launch of the newly built Jinan Ferry on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, the Preparatory Office of the National Economic Commission, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, and the Transportation Commission of the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the Shanghai-Nanjing area issued a public announcement stating: "Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, traffic has been prosperous. The existing Cihang Ferry at the Huangpu River crossing in Minhang on that road is insufficient to meet demand. We have been preparing to build a large ferry capable of carrying ten cars and over one hundred passengers each time, with fast round trips to reduce congestion and facilitate transportation. Now that the entire project for the new ferry has been completed, we have chosen 9:00 AM on October 4th to hold the launch ceremony in Minhang. All cars and pedestrians passing through the ferry on that day, as well as all types of vehicles passing through the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, will be exempt from all passage and crossing fees to express our welcome and commemorate the occasion. (Those crossing the river before 10:00 AM will still be carried free of charge by the existing ferry.) We would be grateful for the guidance of people from all walks of life. No separate invitations will be sent."</p>

<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry previously convened fruit merchants to discuss matters relating to the sale of fruit abroad. After this news was published in the Liverpool Daily Post, Hatton Fruit Firm of that city sent a letter to the International Trade Bureau requesting the addresses of Chinese fruit exporters in order to contact them directly. A translation of the original letter is as follows: "Letter from Hatton Fruit Wholesale Firm of Liverpool"</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, We note from the local newspaper that your country plans to ship fruit to Liverpool for trial sales. Our firm is one of the largest fruit wholesalers between Liverpool and London, specializing in the import of fruit from various countries. We import a large amount of apples and oranges from Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, South America, and California, USA, using refrigerated transport. These goods arrive in Liverpool in perfect condition, so there is a high possibility that your country's fruit can be sold in Liverpool. Our firm is very willing to contact your exporters directly. Please send us the names and addresses of Chinese firms interested in this export. We would be very grateful." Attached is a clipping of "News from the Liverpool Daily Post about Chinese Fruit to be Sold in Liverpool on a Trial Basis". The article states that the Chinese International Trade Bureau, in order to develop foreign trade, will sell fruit on a trial basis in Liverpool, Java, Manila, and Singapore. A broker from a large fruit firm in the city told reporters that the firm welcomes the trial sale of Chinese fruit in Liverpool, but it is still difficult to determine the success of this venture in the future. We humbly submit this report and earnestly request that your Bureau examine and submit it to the Ministry of Industry for approval and implementation, as it is both beneficial to the public and to private interests.</p>

<h3 id="e143">The Navy's Three Transport Ships Converted to Merchant Vessels <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Jing'an Purchased by Sanbei</p>
<p>Pu'an and Ke'an Leased to China Merchants</p>
<p>The Navy Department plans to sell three transport ships. Pu'an has already been leased to China Merchants. Jing'an has now been purchased by Sanbei, and Ke'an is also under negotiation with Liu Hongsheng. The situation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Jing'an Sold: Among the Navy's three transport ships, Jing'an is the most suitable for commercial use. Although Pu'an has many passenger seats, it does not have cargo holds, making it unsuitable for commercial routes. This ship has already signed a lease contract with China Merchants to continue the Qingdao route and is currently under repair. In addition to passenger seats, Jing'an can also carry over one thousand tons of cargo. Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan initially contacted China Merchants and also planned to lease it to the bureau for routes in northern China. Zhou Houkun, the deputy director of the shipping department, went to Beijing to inspect the ship. However, due to the lease price, an agreement was not reached. Yu Qiaqing of Sanbei Company, aiming to develop coastal routes, contacted Minister Chen to purchase the Jing'an. After discussion, the price was reportedly agreed at 260,000 yuan. The two parties have agreed, and payment and delivery of the ship will take place soon. Jing'an has 2,400 tons, with first, second, and third-class passenger seats and cargo holds, and good speed.</p>
<p>Ke'an to be Leased: Ke'an transport ship is similar to Jing'an, but with a shallower draft, making it most suitable for navigating the Zhejiang coastal routes. After Haiyan was ordered to cease operations, China Merchants found that Jiahe was not suitable for the Wenzhou route. Therefore, the repaired Guangji is currently operating on that route. At the same time, China Merchants has been contacting the Navy Department to discuss leasing the Ke'an. Negotiations have been going on for several weeks. Now, Liu Hongsheng has directly discussed the terms of leasing Ke'an with Minister Chen. It is reported that the two sides are close to reaching an agreement. Once the lease contract is signed, the bureau will take over the ship, make some repairs, and then operate the Wenzhou route. According to Minister Chen's intention, the Ke'an should be sold to China Merchants. It is said that the bureau is sympathetic to this idea and will start with a trial lease.</p>

<p>To aid Elderly Émigrés</p>
<p>A letter to this newspaper from the Shanghai Russian Émigré "Elderly Émigré Relief Society" reads: "Dear Sir, Our fundraising representative, Mr. Astakhov, recently returned to Shanghai after raising funds in Guangdong, Macau, Shantou, and Xiamen.

However, the members of our society are all in their seventies and eighties, unable to work, and will need much more assistance in the future. Therefore, our society is now sending Mr. Astakhov, with his donation register, receipt book, permit, registration certificate, articles of association, etc., to raise funds in other parts of your country. We hope that all kind-hearted people will show compassion, regardless of boundaries, and contribute money or clothing so that the elderly members of our society do not become homeless.

<h3 id="e145">Merchants Selling Bottled Colored Wine Granted Exemption from Re-Taxation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Liangshao Wine Industry Association previously stated that the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance stipulated that merchants selling bottled colored wine also had to pay additional taxes, resulting in double taxation and hindering business. The Association sent representatives He Xiangsheng, Ni Yangzhou, Lu Xingjie, and Zhu Shirong to the Department to submit a written petition, explaining the difficult situation and requesting exemption from re-taxation to alleviate merchants' difficulties. The Taxation Department has now approved: "Two petitions regarding the request for exemption from re-taxation on bottled colored wine and the deputation of representatives to present the difficult situation have been received. This case was previously reported by the Jiangsu Stamp and Wine Tax Bureau, requesting the revision of two items of the tax standards for locally produced fruit and herbal wines. The first item concerns the collection of taxes from local wine manufacturers and home brewers, who will be taxed at the rate of 3.2 yuan per hundred jin, the same as that of sorghum wine. The second item concerns merchants who purchase locally produced wine on which fixed-rate taxes have already been paid and then modify it into various colored wines, who will be exempt from paying additional taxes. This has been approved by the Ministry and will be implemented accordingly. It is also stipulated that all stores that sell locally produced wine and also modify it into colored wine must report the estimated quantity and names of the colored wines they will produce throughout the year to the local tax collection agency within a specified period for verification and registration. All such stores will not be issued separate certificates for the containers of colored wines that have been modified from originally taxed wines. If they need to be transported to other places in the province or to other provinces for sale, the merchants should prepare an application, send it to the local tax collection agency for verification, and issue a transportation permit. These measures will be implemented starting from October 1 of this year. The Jiangsu Bureau is ordered to comply. You are hereby ordered to inform all merchants in the same industry. The forms for the application have also been prescribed by the Ministry and sent to the Jiangsu Bureau for printing and distribution to each sub-bureau for use. When selling the aforementioned modified colored wine, the merchants should obtain an application form from the local tax collection agency, fill it out clearly, and submit it for verification and issuance of a transportation permit, which will be used for verification along the way, as the colored wine imported from other provinces should still be taxed at the fixed rate of 3.2 yuan per hundred city jin in accordance with the regulations. This approval, etc." It is also heard that the Association, after receiving the approval, has notified all its members to comply.</p>

<p>Never Before Recorded</p>
<p>The Song Edition Sutra Printing Society at 714 Weihaiwei Road has strived for perfection in its printing of Song Qisha Sutras. They have sought and compared various printing plates from far and near, and have discovered one or two dozen versions. Recently, Dharma Master Fan Cheng obtained hand-scroll copies of Sutras from Guangsheng Temple in Shanxi to supplement the Qisha Sutras. Ye Gongchuo recently invited Zhu Qinglan, Xu Naichang, Jiang Weiqiao, Dong Kang, Zhang Yuanji, Xia Jingguan, Zhao Zunyue, Yuan Tongli, and others to his residence to exhibit and study these ancient Sutras. Dong Kang determined that they were engraved in the early Northern Song Dynasty. Zhang Yuanji said that the characters were slightly angular, suggesting that they were engraved in the Southern Song or Jin Dynasty, but the engraving method and printing paper were all from the Northern school, which was generally recognized by the others. There are currently over five thousand volumes of these Sutras, which have never been recorded in public or private collections, making them extremely valuable. It has been decided to reprint them, defining a single typeface. The printing will be done by the printing society in Beijing and Shanghai, and the parties are already in contact. Someone mentioned that they had read Sutra scrolls with 22 lines of 18 characters per page, 23 lines of 14 characters, 25 lines of 26 characters, and 31 lines of 21 characters. The ends of the paper had a long red stamp that read "Monk Zu Mei, Head of the Sutra Printing Society."

<h3 id="e148">Xiangbei Dispute Mediated in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations to Continue Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association had a dispute with the Ningbo Yaojiang Xiangbei Cooperative over the transport and sale of Fritillaria cirrhosa, as has been previously reported. Zhang Shenzhi and Fang Jiaobo, prominent figures from Ningbo in Shanghai, mediated the dispute. Yesterday (the 2nd), they convened representatives from the three parties at the Yong'an Company's Great Eastern and Western Restaurant to resolve the issue. Those present included Zheng Jiahao, Xu Youheng, and Cui Gongzhang, directors of the Yaojiang Xiangbei Cooperative, Cai Tonghao, Chen Chuxiang, and Tong Guangfu, members of the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and Weng Yangqing, a representative of the Ningbo Pharmacy. Also present were Mu Xizhang, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction stationed at the Yaojiang Xiangbei Cooperative, and Ye Mei, a cooperation instructor from Yinxian. At the meeting, Chairman Zhang Shenzhi and Fang Jiaobo gave speeches encouraging peaceful resolution and preventing escalation. Subsequently, Xu Youheng, a representative of the Yaojiang Xiangbei Cooperative, and Cai Tonghao, a representative of the National Medicine Industry Association, both made earnest statements expressing their willingness to reconcile. Mu Xizhang, the Zhejiang Construction Department representative stationed at the cooperative, provided a thorough explanation of the regulations for Fritillaria cirrhosa prices and the Shanghai pharmaceutical industry's misunderstandings of the Fritillaria cirrhosa cooperative. Next, Weng Yangqing, the representative of the Ningbo Pharmacy, expressed his willingness to terminate the sales contract with the cooperative to avoid external misunderstandings. The cooperative stated that termination of the contract required a replacement; otherwise, the current sales relationship would create practical difficulties. Finally, it was decided that representatives from the three parties would go to the Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association at 2:00 PM today (the 3rd) for further negotiations, with the goal of eliminating prejudices and achieving a satisfactory resolution. The meeting adjourned in harmony after 2:00 PM.</p>

<p>Tenants Claim Lease Not Expired</p>
<p>Issue a Declaration Seeking Assistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council felt that the Huishan Small Vegetable Market was too small to accommodate the public and wanted to build a larger vegetable market to benefit vegetable vendors and residents. After surveying, they found that the location of Huashouli opposite the vegetable market was most suitable. They consulted with the owner, the British firm Sickber &amp; Co., and proposed to exchange the land, with the Municipal Council paying Sickber &amp; Co. 32,000 taels of silver. Sickber &amp; Co. felt that this move by the Municipal Council was also for the benefit of the citizens and did not refuse. They accepted the exchange terms. The Municipal Council notified all tenants of Huashouli on August 29th, giving them one month to move out to facilitate the handover. After receiving the notice, the tenants of the neighborhood claimed that when the houses were completed in 1922, all tenants had spent three months' rent and digging fees, ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per household, or at least 600 to 700 yuan. The landlord verbally agreed to a 20-year lease. Counting the years, only eleven years have passed. Now, they are using the excuse of renovating the small vegetable market to force them to move, which is an unreasonable oppression. They asked the legal advisor of the Huashouli Tenants' Association, lawyer Jiang Chiping, to formally inquire with the Municipal Council whether the vegetable market renovation was actually happening. Until the deadline for relocation arrived the day before yesterday, there was still no reply. Just as they were hesitating, Sickber &amp; Co., seeing that the tenants were still residing there and not preparing to move, knew that it could not be resolved by peaceful means and decided to cut off the water supply first to force them to comply. Therefore, all the tenants became more and more panicked. In addition to negotiating with the water company to continue supplying drinking water, which the company understood and agreed to, they also issued a declaration seeking social assistance. However, the Municipal Council's plan to build a wide vegetable market on the site has been finalized, and it is feared that the tenants will eventually have to move.</p>

<p>The first group of 43 athletes from track and field, football, and basketball arrived yesterday.</p>
<p>The second group, including women's basketball and men's and women's volleyball teams, will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>Confidence is high in securing the women's basketball championship.</p>
<p>The Fujian Province delegation participating in the National Games, with a first group of 43 athletes, arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jinan" steamer. They are staying at the Great Eastern Hotel. The second group will arrive tomorrow aboard the "Hua'an" steamer. They will proceed to Beijing together on the 5th. Last night, we met with the head coach of the delegation, Chen Zhang'e, and others, and recorded their conversation as follows:</p>
<p>The athlete delegation departs in two groups. The first group of 43 people arrived in Shanghai yesterday, including the men's basketball team, football, tennis, track and field, and swimming athletes, as well as head coach Chen Zhang'e, general secretary Deng Shixi, and others. Chief leader Lin Yin'nan will arrive with the second group, which includes the women's basketball players and men's and women's volleyball teams. They will arrive here tomorrow aboard the "Hua'an."</p>
<p>Lin Shaozhou excels in the high hurdles. Among the track and field athletes, Lin Shaozhou is the most promising. Lin was the champion in the high hurdles at the previous National Games. He achieved a time of 16.8 seconds in the Fujian preliminary rounds with ease. He may make even greater progress in the National Games. His javelin throw of 47.45 meters is slightly less certain, as it was achieved with the wind at his back during the preliminary rounds.</p>
<p>Chen Xingyu has potential in long-distance running. Long-distance runner Chen Xingyu also shows promise. His preliminary round results were 2 minutes 12.6 seconds for the 800 meters and 4 minutes 29 seconds for the 1500 meters. If he has no strong competitors, he may improve further. The Shanghai newspaper mistakenly reported his 800-meter time as 2 minutes 3 seconds and his 1500-meter time as 4 minutes 2 seconds. This was due to a telegraphic error. However, Chen is young and strong, and these results are already very good.</p>
<p>Confidence is high in securing the women's basketball championship. According to basketball instructor Yang Xushi, the women's basketball team is certain to win the championship. Representing Jimei, they defeated the Liangjiang team from Xiamen by a score of 17 to 33. The team toured Singapore and other places, winning all 17 games. Center Chen Rongtang and forward Xue Zhengxia are definitely stars. Guard Xu Sufen is the sister of football star Xu Yahui and is also exceptionally strong. Recently, Huang Shuhua from Liangjiang joined the team, making their strength perfect. It is unfortunate that they will face Shanghai in the second week of the National Games, which is somewhat disappointing. The men's team seems to lack experience.</p>
<p>The impact of the Communist bandit menace. Due to the government authorities being busy suppressing the Communists, they have had no time to focus on sports in Fujian. Counties in the bandit areas are obstructed by transportation, so only five counties participated in the provincial preliminary rounds, with Fuzhou and Xiamen as the foundation.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 2nd dispatch) The National Games Organizing Committee held a standing committee meeting at the Ministry of Education on the evening of the 2nd. Those in attendance were the standing committee members, general manager Zhang Xinfu, and the heads of various groups and sections, presided over by Chairman Chu Minyi. The key points of their resolutions are as follows: (1) The reception group's hospitality measures were approved. Track and field and ball game referees will stay at the Central Hotel, while martial arts referees will stay at the Veterans' School and New Village. (2) Several honorary directors were added to both the publicity and general affairs groups. (3) The publicity group reported on Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education's concerns regarding a letter stating that news about the games had been prematurely disclosed by a few newspapers, which was unfair and made the publicity group seem useless. The general manager reported that the competition schedule and other news published in various newspapers were copied freely by reporters at the department and were not officially released. The organizing committee will not be responsible for any corrections. It was resolved that, henceforth, all departments and groups should ask Wu Xinzhai to be responsible for contacting airplane photography for the release of news. (5) The next standing committee meeting is scheduled for 7 PM on the afternoon of the 6th.</p>

<p>Still needs to raise funds for football to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Athlete numbers have been reduced by half.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong dispatch) Since the Hong Kong Amateur Sports Federation began preparing to send a team to the National Games, it organized a fundraising committee. For a time, it was vigorous and impressive. In addition to conducting fundraising separately, the heads of various departments selected athletes for each event. However, for the past half-month, due to the lack of fundraising success, the original dispatch plan has wavered. Furthermore, because Chairman Mo Yingyue has spent little time in Hong Kong and has had little leadership, it is as if the dragons have lost their head. Since the establishment of the committee, Mr. Mo has only attended one meeting. Since then, he has not attended. Most recently, yesterday, Chairman Mo hurriedly returned from the province. It was found that the meeting yesterday discussed four issues: (1) Recruitment of football players; (2) Fundraising; (3) Staff travel expenses; (4) Sending personnel. After about an hour of discussion, it was resolved as follows: It is planned to select Lai Guozhao, Li Guoqi, and He Jiaqiang from the Kowloon Chinese Athletic Association for the football team. As for fundraising, in addition to continuing to solicit donations externally, we will ask the South China Athletic Association to do its best to help. For staff travel expenses, in addition to the team leader, instructors, and male and female managers being paid for by the federation, the federation can also provide a title for others who wish to go, but they must bear their own travel expenses. Regarding the number of representatives to be sent, it was decided to send twelve softball players, eleven male volleyball players, eleven female volleyball players, seven male swimmers, seven female swimmers, four tennis players, and four staff members, totaling 56 people. The federation will advance 2,000 yuan for the thirteen football players to travel on their own, with the expectation that the funds will be reimbursed after they are raised in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Shanghai YMCA in this city, considering that there is no public swimming pool in Shanghai for our countrymen to swim year-round, but the public's interest in swimming is increasing day by day, with a great need for year-round access, and swimming is the only sport recognized by everyone, but to achieve beautiful form and excellent results, long-term practice is essential. The YMCA, recognizing this, has decided to open the swimming pool year-round to facilitate practice for our countrymen. Therefore, they have specially invited enthusiastic promoters of sports, such as Cheng Yize, Hu Yunlai, Chen Qizhao, Shen Siliang, Bi Zibi, Zhu Liancheng, Cheng Houkun, and Feng Zuozhou, to serve as committee members and have held meetings to plan and proceed.

<h3 id="e188">Results of the Hunan Provincial Games <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>An Incident Occurs Due to Exceeding the Number of Participants</p>
<p>(Changsha Correspondence) The 13th Hunan Provincial Games opened on September 20th. The session was originally scheduled for four days, but due to a major disturbance on the third day, it was suspended for half a day, so the session was extended by one day and closed on the 24th. The results of this session were worse than in previous sessions, and the atmosphere at the venue was also very cold, without the enthusiasm of the past. In total, only 13 units participated in this provincial games, including Changsha City, Changsha County, Shaoyang County, Yueyang County, Lingling County, Hengyang County, Ningxiang County, Yiyang County, Changde County, Taoyuan County, Yuanjiang County, Xiangxiang County, and You County, with a total of more than 520 athletes. Considering that there are 76 counties and cities in the province, only a little over one-sixth participated, which shows the lack of enthusiasm. On the first two days, most of the victories went to Changsha City and County. During the competition at 8 AM on the third day (September 22nd), it was suddenly discovered that Changsha County had five participants in the women's 50-meter race (one extra), and Changsha City had five participants in the men's high jump, long jump, and shot put (one extra in each). Zheng Yangxin, the chief leader of Changde, protested, arguing that it violated the competition rules and requested that they be punished. However, the allocation department of the Games and all personnel sided with them, arousing public anger. As a result, the 11 units from other counties and cities participating in the province all led their athletes out of the venue, and all competitions were suspended. At that time, the Vice President Zhu Jingnong (who is the Director of Education) and the Director of the Preparatory Office Zhang Kailian (who is the Director of Finance) were holding a provincial affairs meeting in the provincial government. Hearing of this uproar, they were extremely anxious and immediately rushed to the venue to convene an emergency meeting, which jointly resolved several matters as follows: (1) The chief leaders of Changsha City and Changsha County, who registered excessive numbers of participants in violation of the competition rules, should be reprimanded. (2) The competition qualifications for the women's 50-meter race in Changsha County and the men's high jump, long jump, and shot put in Changsha City should be revoked, and the vacancies should be filled by promotion in rank. (3) The allocation department of the Games was negligent, causing the dispute, and should be reprimanded. (4) The chief leaders of Changde and other counties, having discovered the aforementioned violations and made a request, left the venue with their teams without waiting for the Games to resolve the issue, disrupting the order of the venue, and should be reprimanded. (5) If any county or city unit does not comply with the above resolutions or does not attend the competition, they will be considered absent, and the Department of Education will impose severe penalties. After the resolutions were announced, Zhang Kailian also sent personnel to mediate in various ways. It was not until 5 PM that a result was achieved, and all parties expressed acceptance and re-entered the venue to hold the sports events. Although the disturbance was quelled, the sports events could not be completed as scheduled, so the Games were extended by one day, and all events were not completed until 7 PM on the 24th, when the closing ceremony was announced. The total expenditure was only 10,000 yuan. The results of each event are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Partial Resolution of Slaughter Tax and Tooth Tax Fees in Beijing and Shanghai <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Slaughter Tax Resolved by the City to Subsidize Provincial Fees</p>
<p>Shanghai City Tooth Tax Has Been Continued by the Province This Year After Negotiation</p>
<p>After Nanjing and Shanghai were established as special cities, it was proposed that the two taxes, the slaughter tax and the tooth tax, which were previously collected by the two counties of Jiangning and Shanghai, be taken over by the cities. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government argued that the slaughter tax and tooth tax of these two counties were designated as special funds for Jiangsu education. The provincial and municipal governments disputed the issue of jurisdiction for several years. During this period, the Ministry of Education and relevant departments and provincial and municipal governments held repeated meetings and dispatched representatives to negotiate. Finally, due to the relationship between these two taxes and the special funds for Jiangsu education, the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office began to entrust the Shanghai Municipal Government to collect and remit the slaughter tax in the summer of the 20th year, with a fixed annual tax of 70,000 yuan, which was an increase compared to the Jiangsu package amount. (The Nanjing slaughter tax was also agreed upon by the Beijing Municipal Government and the Education Fund Management Office, with the city collecting and remitting the tax.) Regarding the tooth tax, the Shanghai Municipal Government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan a month ago, ordering the provincial government to transfer the tax to the city for collection. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Education to review it, and the Ministry of Education, considering that the management of this tax was related to the special funds for Jiangsu education, consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government for its opinion before further review. Now that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has approved the consultation, it has replied through the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office that the tooth tax has always been handled by the county government and the Finance Bureau, and the results have been excellent. Last year, the Jiangsu Education Fund Committee decided to solicit merchants for bidding and contracting, and for the past year, it has been handled in accordance with the regulations, and the tax payments have been cleared on a monthly basis. It has already been approved to continue handling this year's tooth tax in accordance with the resolution. It is heard that the provincial government will soon submit a request to the Ministry of Education for review.</p>

<p>The Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province has compared the number of primary school teachers in each county of Jiangsu Province over the past 20 years and compiled statistics. The following is an excerpt of the main points:</p>
<p>(1) The total number of primary school teachers in various counties of Jiangsu Province in the first year was 9,312 people. (Omitted 2-4) In the fifth year, it was 12,787 people (an increase of 3,475 people compared to the first year). In the tenth year, it was 16,075 people (an increase of 6,763 people compared to the first year, an increase of 3,288 people compared to the fifth year). In the fifteenth year, it was 16,236 people (an increase of 7,024 people compared to the first year, an increase of 3,549 people compared to the fifth year, an increase of 261 people compared to the tenth year).

<p>(2) From 9,312 people in the first year to 19,332 people in the twentieth year, there was an increase of 10,020 people, which is 2.2 times the original number. The average annual increase was 527 people.</p>
<p>(3) Comparing the number of teachers increased in each year with the previous year, the order of increase is as follows: 1st, 17th year, 2,300 people; 2nd, 4th year, 1,122 people; 3rd, 10th year, 974 people; 4th, 1st year, 961 people; 5th, 3rd year, 933 people; 6th, 14th year, 839 people; 7th, 16th year, 765 people; 8th, 5th year, 740 people; 9th, 8th year, 727 people; 10th, 7th year, 691 people; 11th, 2nd year, 680 people; 12th, 9th year, 670 people; 13th, 12th year, 524 people; 14th, 20th year, 312 people; 15th, 18th year, 236 people; 16th, 6th year, 226 people; 17th, 13th year, a decrease of 171 people; 18th, 9th year, a decrease of 617 people; 19th, 15th year, a decrease of 2,234 people.</p>

<p>(5) In the 20 years, the number of teachers in each county fluctuated. Comparing the tenth year with the first year, the number decreased in Wujiang and Yangshan. Comparing the twentieth year with the first year, the number decreased in Shanghai, Taicang, and Baoying.</p>
<p>(6) In the first year, the number of teachers was less than 100 in 32 counties, including Xuhai, Ning, and Yangzhou. In the twentieth year, the number of teachers was less than 100 in only 10 counties, including Yangzhong, Baoying, Siyang, Jiangpu, Donghai, Qiu, Ganyu, Yizheng, Gaoyou, and Jiangning.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Comparative Statistics of Primary School Numbers in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province Over the Past Twenty Years <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province has compiled statistics comparing the number of primary schools in each county over the past twenty years. Excerpts of the key points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the first year, the total number of primary schools in various counties of Jiangsu was 4,716. In the fifth year, there were 6,157 schools (an increase of 1,441 schools compared to the first year). In the tenth year, there were 7,401 schools (an increase of 2,685 schools compared to the first year, and an increase of 1,244 schools compared to the fifth year). In the fifteenth year, there were 6,862 schools (an increase of 2,146 schools compared to the first year, an increase of 705 schools compared to the fifth year, and a decrease of 539 schools compared to the tenth year). In the twentieth year, there were 8,360 schools (an increase of 3,644 schools compared to the first year, an increase of 2,203 schools compared to the fifth year, an increase of 959 schools compared to the tenth year, an increase of 1,498 schools compared to the fifteenth year, and an increase of 48 schools compared to the previous year).</p>
<p>(2) From 4,716 schools in the first year to 8,360 schools in the twentieth year, there was a total increase of 3,644 schools, which is 1.77 times the original number. On average, there was an increase of 351 schools per year.</p>
<p>(3) Comparing the increase in schools in each year, the largest increase was in the seventeenth year, with 1,122 schools. The smallest increase was in the sixth year, with only 6 schools more than the fifth year. The difference between the highest and lowest increases is 1,116 schools.</p>
<p>(4) The total number of schools increased in most years, but decreased in the fifteenth year compared to the fourteenth year, with a reduction of 1,211 schools. The number of schools reduced in this year exceeded the number of schools increased in any other year. The number of schools reduced in the fifteenth year accounted for one-third of the total increase in schools over the past twenty years.</p>
<p>(5) The number of schools increased in each year did not increase steadily or decrease consistently. There were significant fluctuations. The years are listed below in descending order of the increase compared to the previous year: 1,122 schools in the seventeenth year; 466 schools in the fourth year; 409 schools in the third year; 380 schools in the first year; 345 schools in the tenth year; 322 schools in the fifth year; 306 schools in the seventh year; 304 schools in the eighth year; 283 schools in the ninth year; 243 schools in the twelfth year; 202 schools in the eighteenth year; 168 schools in the twelfth year; 115 schools in the thirteenth year; 98 schools in the sixteenth year; 48 schools in the twentieth year; 28 schools in the nineteenth year; 9 schools in the fourteenth year; 6 schools in the sixth year; a decrease of 1,211 schools in the fifteenth year.</p>
<p>(6) Observing the number of schools increased in each year, it can be seen that the progress in the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh years was the most consistent. There was a sudden increase in the third, fourth, and seventh years, and a sudden decrease in the sixth and fifth years. After the nineteenth year, the increase in the number of schools was extremely small, less than one-tenth of that in the seventh, eighth, and ninth years. Therefore, the development of the number of schools over the past twenty years has formed an arc shape.</p>
<p>(7) Although the total number of schools increased in the twenty years, except for the fifteenth year, there were also increases and decreases in the number of schools in individual counties. Compared to the first year, there were decreases in the fifth year in the following nine counties: Jiangning, Jintan, Liyang, Jinshan, Taicang, Wujiang, Wujin, Yixing, and Huaiyin. Compared to the fifth year, there were decreases in the tenth year in the following nine counties: Gaochun, Songjiang, Fengxian, Jinshan, Wu Feng, Pei, Pi, Dangshan. Compared to the tenth year, there were decreases in the fifteenth year in the following twenty-seven counties: Jiangning, Gaochun, Zhenjiang, Liyang, Shanghai, Songjiang, Fengxian, Baoshan, Chongming, Haimen, Wu, Changshu, Kunshan, Wujiang, Wuxi, Jingjiang, Jiangdu, Dongtai, Tongshan, Feng, Pei, Xiao, Pi, Donghai, Guanyun, Muyang, and Ganyu. Compared to the fifteenth year, there were decreases in the twentieth year in the following eight counties: Jiading, Chongming, Nantong, Taixing, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, and Tongshan. Furthermore, compared to the first year, there were decreases in the twentieth year in the following five counties: Jiangning, Fengxian, Wujiang, Shanghai, and Baoying.</p>
<p>(8) In the twentieth year, there were no counties where the number of schools neither increased nor decreased. Compared to the nineteenth year, the smallest decrease was in Yangzhong and other counties, with a decrease of one school. The largest decrease was in Jiangning, Liyang, and Shanghai.</p>
<p>(9) In the first year, the following seventeen counties had more than 100 schools: Jiangning, Liyang, Shanghai, Songjiang, Nanhui, Qingpu, Chongming, Haimen, Wuxian, Changshu, Wujiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Yixing, Jiangyin, Nantong, and Rugao. In the twentieth year, the following four counties had more than 300 schools: Wujin, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Nantong. The following six counties had more than 200 schools: Haimen, Wu, Changshu, Yixing, Rugao, and Nanhui. The remaining counties with more than 100 schools were: Jurong, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Liyang, Songjiang, Qingpu, Taicang, Jiading, Chongming, Kunshan, Wujiang, Taixing, Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Funing, Dongtai, Taixian, Tongshan, Fengpei, Dangshan, Suqian, Suining, and Qidong. Conversely, twenty-four counties had less than 100 schools (there were a total of forty-three counties with less than 100 schools in the first year).</p>
<p>(10) In the twentieth year, the county with the highest number of schools was Wujin with 380 schools. The county with the lowest number of schools was Yangzhong with 2 schools, followed by Ganyu with 5 schools. The difference between the highest and lowest number of schools was 378 schools, which is 190 times the lowest number.</p>
<p>(11) The proportion of schools increased in each county varied greatly. For example, comparing the first year to the twentieth year, the largest increase was in Lishui, from 3 schools to 178 schools, which is an increase of 18 times. The smallest increase was in Jinshan, from 86 schools to 89 schools. The following twenty-six counties had an increase of more than twice the original number: Jurong, Gaochun, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jiangyin, Nantong, Rugao, Taixing, Jingjiang, Lianshui, Yancheng, Funing, Xinghua, Taixian, Tongshan, Fengsu, Dangshan, Suqian, Suining, Donghai, Guanyun, Muyang, and Ganyu.</p>

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e214">National Martial Arts Competition and National Examination – Yi Ming <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>In the 22nd year, the National Martial Arts Team participated in the sports competition, breaking a new record that has never been seen before. From the county games to the district games, from the district games to the provincial games, they are about to participate in the National Games. If according to the regulations of amateur sports, the athletes are purely students as the main body, teachers should not participate in it. This season, the Central Guoshu Museum is scheduled to hold the National Martial Arts Examination on October 20. According to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for the National Martial Arts Examination, the National Examination must be selected by the provinces and cities, and only those who are guaranteed by the provincial and municipal governments can participate. The provincial and municipal examinations must be guaranteed by the county government, and the county examinations must be guaranteed by the district village chief. This is because the situations in each province are different. Some provinces have not established a provincial Guoshu Museum, and some have been established during the suspension period. The county government has not been ordered to hold a county examination. The national martial arts institutions in each county may have branches, or research societies, and they will select national examination players, and the sports personnel organized by the county may think that the sports meeting and the martial arts examination are the same thing at the same time, so the martial arts experts or teachers who have been guaranteed by various halls to be pre-selected for the national examination are included in the sports competition. The county does not distinguish between competition and examination as two separate things, and each district therefore, and the province also therefore continues to do so, and will implement participation in the National Games.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Central Guoshu Museum, since the promotion, it has been holding examinations with all its strength, which is not only limited to students in various counties, but also talents left behind in rural areas can also be guaranteed. Therefore, letters and telegrams are sent to various provinces to urge them to register. The provincial party did not hold the provincial examination, which means that the provincial party gave up the right to examination. The districts and counties did not receive a clear order from the provincial party, and they wanted to go to the examination but could not, so they had to graft wood and replace plums, and use the national examination as a competition, and regard it as the same. Therefore, there is no distinction between軒輊, in the provinces without provincial museums, the measures are not well done, and compared with other provinces and cities that have national examinations, they are inferior. From the perspective of the martial arts staff themselves, since they have participated in the National Games, and also participated in the National Martial Arts Examination, the distance is only a few days, and the competition needs to be held many times. For the sake of cherishing their energy, before the National Games and the National Martial Arts Examination are held, I deeply hope that the persons in charge will check whether there is such an error and quickly improve it. Do not regard one and two as two and one.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Anti <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>In the past, the word "anti" was a taboo in the era of monarchs, and should be avoided from afar. Sun Yingyan created the "fanqie" at the end of the Han Dynasty. By the Tang Dynasty, because the word "anti" was very conspicuous, "anti" was avoided and "fan" was used. This is a very obvious example. It is said that during the Qing Dynasty, a certain official supervised education in a certain province and issued a intercepted title "Wang Su Chu Ling Anti"! Public opinion was in an uproar, and the exam was almost罢. The censor reported the matter, and the official was dismissed and never reused. It is said that the reason why the official made such a mess was because he did not believe in fox fairies, so the fox fairies asked him to eat a big loss of the word "anti". Originally, in the past imperial examination era, there were many words that should be avoided in ink scrolls, such as "kill", "rebel", "steal", etc.; and "anti" was one of them. For example, if you say "rectify chaos", the meaning is very grand, so you have to change "anti" to "return". This is because the word "anti" is disliked by the monarch, and subjects and gentry people cannot but be cautious. As for "chaos", although it is also conspicuous, it is probably because Zhu Xi, who had eaten cold pork, interpreted it as "also governance"; so "suppress chaos" can still be written as "suppress chaos", and does not need to be changed to "suppress governance". Descending to the Republic of China, this kind of profound rule is naturally on the list of abolitions, so words such as "anti-righteousness" and "anti-communist" are often seen or heard in newspapers and mouths. However, the individual word "anti" has not yet been officially used, so it is replaced by "endangering the country." This is a kind of roundabout way. Although four more words are written, it seems more冠冕than just writing the single word "anti". The writing skills of today's people are really admirable. There are also words such as "anti-imperialism" and "anti-war", because they cannot follow the example of "suppressing chaos and returning to righteousness" and avoid "anti" and use "return"; so they have to be left as they are. Fortunately, the so-called "anti-imperialism" and "anti-war" are just talking and writing, and are所时尚. In fact, "anti" its name but not "anti" its reality, you can大“anti”而特“anti”, so what忌讳there is!</p>
<p>Please think about it, readers, if we were born in the era of monarchs, to create such fashionable nouns and make a splash; may I ask, what word can the word "anti" be replaced with? Is it good to use "return"? From this point alone, it can be seen that we were born today, we cannot but say that we are "very blessed".</p>
<h3 id="e216">Officialdom and Wealth <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>Whenever I return to my hometown, the neighbors always ask me endlessly: "When will you become an official and get rich, young master?" Although I'm used to hearing these kinds of questions, and the dreadfulness of their meaning seems to have faded, I still feel a sting every time I'm hit by these vulgar queries. After the sting, I often can't answer a single word, just giving a silly smile; because I know their motives for asking are entirely well-intentioned. On one hand, it's undoubtedly like those pointless social pleasantries such as "Nice weather" and "Have you eaten?", but on the other hand, it also contains a sincere concern for my recent situation away from home. Of course, I should be grateful for their kindness. However, on the other hand, the question of "becoming an official and getting rich" perfectly demonstrates the outdated traditional thinking of the old Chinese society. In the past, parents all hoped their sons would study the Four Books and Five Classics, pass the imperial examinations, and become officials, so a person was only in contact with the "official" flavor from birth to death. For example, in the Jiangnan area, boys' nicknames always include "× official;" even children from families so poor that they didn't even have enough to eat and never had the opportunity to study, let alone take the imperial examinations and become "officials," still had good "official" names. It's truly an incomprehensible joke; and the jokes don't stop there. In the past, people hoped their sons would become "officials," so they also hoped their sons would "return home in glory," saying it would "bring honor to the family." Even the neighbors hoped someone else's son would become the top scholar and prime minister, saying it would "bring honor to the hometown." From this point, it's clear how important the concept of hometown is to the Chinese. In unofficial histories and folk tales, it's always the same "distressed young master who becomes the top scholar" and is praised for his "glorious return home."</p>
<p>Besides becoming an "official," getting "rich" is also something everyone enjoys. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, the first thing said while clasping hands to others is "Congratulations on getting rich." Everywhere you look, you see temples of the God of Wealth, and on the fourth day of the first lunar month, many pious men and women go to worship sincerely. Thus, it's evident that the Chinese hope to get "rich" no less than they hope to become "officials." And the Chinese have a kind of "maxim" that becoming an "official" allows you to get "rich."</p>
<p>The Chinese worship "officials" and "wealth" too much, devoting themselves wholeheartedly until death. I hope this traditional thinking will change for the better!</p>

<p>"Coming without a hair's breadth of error, two 'qián' and five 'kūn' make a family, for a time, it's beaten into a chaotic mess, only settling by Qingming," these are the words of a predecessor praising the abacus. In these years of surging new trends, all things are moving towards renewal, abolishing old systems, it's unimaginable that a mere abacus can stand firm like a pillar in a rapid current! The abacus can well be proud of itself!</p>
<p>I work in the accounting department of a store, and I feel that "I cannot be without this gentleman for a single day" when it comes to the abacus. Although written calculation is also very popular now, most merchants still use the abacus when buying and selling goods, because written calculation is never as fast and convenient. Therefore, even foreign-owned companies and trading houses cannot do without it. When using the abacus, unlike written calculation, there is no decimal point to separate the zero numbers from the whole numbers, it all depends on remembering the position before moving the beads. Ordinary people rarely study this when calculating simple "multiplication" or "division," but for multi-digit "multiplication" or "division," if you don't remember the "positioning formula" before calculating, it's easy to make mistakes! Abacuses are usually made with seven beads per rod, two on top and five on the bottom. In the past, Shou Xiaotianjun of Kuaiji invented an abacus where each rod still had seven beads, but with three on top and four on the bottom, calling it the Shou-style abacus, but it didn't become popular later, so the market still uses the old style.</p>
<p>There are many metaphors using the abacus, such as: for people who are dull and inactive, people curse them like the abacus beads that move back and forth. If you only think about your own wishes, planning for unattainable gains, people call it a "wishful abacus." As for its games, there are several types, such as: playing abacus chess, "Five Tigers Descending to Western Sichuan," "Lion Rolling an Embroidered Ball," etc. The funniest thing is that the abacus also contains superstitious ideas. Please look around, there are never pairs of beads in a row, because the abacus is mostly used by merchants, and merchants work hard all year round, nothing more than to seize opportunities and strive for profit, with small gains as the main goal. Merchants use the four words "profit, loss, income, and expenses" to count each bead on the abacus rod, until the last one, which must be either "profit" or "income." Whether it's an abacus with nine, eleven, thirteen, or fifteen rods, it's all like this, which can already infer a glimpse of their psychology.</p>

<p>— Donghaibochen</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Ziming has introduced "Master Wang" and "Fifth Madam" before, and I will introduce "Miss Wang" without fear of being ridiculed for imitation.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, although Miss Wang was not born into a noble family, because she has no older siblings and no younger brothers or sisters, Mr. and Mrs. Wang treated her like a treasure, protecting her with utmost care.</p>
<p>Her face is truly lovely; her skin is so delicate it could be broken with a puff, with smiling dimples, not to mention her "passionate" actions. Some devotees of love ideologies chase her like "mosquitoes seeing blood." Needless to say, Miss Wang doesn't need to buy her own decorations, several friends naturally compete to win her favor. She embraces the "open door" principle, adhering to the motto "since they've come, let them stay," and she has as many as six dozen lovers, which is quite amazing, considering her skillful tactics. It is said that she lost her virginity long ago because of this.</p>
<p>She likes to be active in social gatherings, and although she cannot write or make speeches, she is called the belle of society just for her face, which shows how much society values her.</p>
<p>At the age of nineteen, she was loved by a retired general and became his kept woman. In less than a year, she had a child, and her life was extremely happy. But she had other ideas and divorced the retired general. As a result, partly because of her reputation, she reluctantly took out 100,000 yuan in alimony, and now she is much freer.</p>
<p>Miss Wang's life can be said to have come to an end here.</p>

<p>Chapter Sixteen: Bitterness in the Heart Still Sends Blessings / Hasty Military Life Secretly Brings About Change</p>
<p>As he spoke, he turned around and saw a large group of guests congratulating the couple, crowded behind him. There was no room for him to stand there and joke, so he nodded to Ji Zhi and said, "Please come inside and sit, I'll be right there." After speaking, he was swarmed away by a group of people. Gui Zhi was squeezed among the crowd, and after initially being stunned by seeing Ji Zhi, she smiled and nodded, without deeply acknowledging him in any way. Ji Zhi watched this group of people go away in the distance. He thought to himself, "I came late, I didn't come early, and I came on the day of their engagement, it's like I came to congratulate them. Although I'm not jealous, I don't have such magnanimity." He stood blankly outside the gate for a while, then returned to the entrance of the milk tea shop, took Zhang San's rickshaw, and went to Xizhimen. Zhao Ziqiang followed the group of people back, and when he didn't see him, he was covered in sweat. Of course, he wouldn't ask again. Today, the Zhao and Yang families were filled with joyous events. In the main house to the north of the Zhao family, there were two or three square tables filled with teacups, cigarette trays, and dried fruit plates. The ground was covered with candy wrappers and melon and peanut shells. The room was filled with the sound of people talking and laughing, and the space was filled with fog. It wasn't real fog, but the smoke exhaled by the guests who were smoking, filling the space. The three small houses of the Yang family were also filled with female guests. Haidian is still considered a semi-rural area, so the women were also infected with the new-style makeup habits of the city, so this house was filled with the fragrance of rouge and powder. Gui Zhi sat on her kang, surrounded by a large group of girls dressed in red and purple, talking and laughing with her. Of course, she was very intoxicated during this period of time. Usually, families holding weddings, apart from performing ordinary rituals, are nothing more than eating, smoking, and gambling. The Zhao and Yang families were no exception today. (203)</p>

<p>Dr. Reinauer of the United States studied the relationship between the endocrine glands and criminal behavior among inmates at California prisons. His examinations revealed that the endocrine glands of most criminals were abnormal. These hundreds of patients with glandular diseases could be divided into three groups based on the differences in their glandular functions: thyroid gland disorders, pituitary gland disorders, and gonad disorders (the thyroid gland is in the throat, the pituitary gland is in the brain, and the gonads are the testicles and ovaries). The first type is mostly nervous, emotionally impulsive, and mentally unstable. More than 70 percent of them have committed acts of violence, i.e., crimes involving harming or killing people, assassinations, and murder for money. Among them, five were the most stubborn and difficult to deal with, often launching savage attacks on fellow inmates. Therefore, doctors were asked to diagnose and treat them. After surgery on the diseased thyroid glands, their conditions and behaviors significantly improved. The second type is mostly kind and affable people, but lacking a sense of responsibility and ambition. More than 80 percent of them were punished for crimes such as fraud, impersonation, embezzlement, or misappropriation of public funds and theft, but it is worth noting that none of them committed violent crimes. After treatment with endocrine hormones, their personalities greatly improved despite a lack of educational influence. Their attitudes towards people and things gradually became more serious, and they began to understand their responsibilities to society and humanity. The third type is mostly cautious, quiet, and law-abiding people who can usually control their emotions and desires, but sometimes they will burst out uncontrollably and spontaneously. The crimes they commit are mostly unexpected offenses against public morals. After treatment with endocrine hormones, their physical and mental states significantly improved. According to Dr. Reinauer's opinion, a person's crime is partly due to the inducement of other economic conditions, but the most important factor is the abnormality of mental function, which is related to the physical condition, specifically, the biochemical action of metabolism, which is entirely under the main influence of the endocrine glands. Therefore, he firmly believes that ordinary criminals with abnormal behavior can be completely transformed into normal people through the equalization of glandular secretions. Although research in this area is not yet conclusive, its partial truth is undeniable, so it has attracted great attention from legal scholars around the world. Perhaps one day human laws will undergo a fundamental transformation, and all inhumane criminal punishments such as beheading, hanging, and shooting will be abolished. Criminals will not need to go to prison, but only to hospitals; and with the advancement of medical technology, all unreasonable criminal behavior can be prevented in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Is Being Thin Better Than Being Fat? <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Xinong</p>
<p>People often say: "Although a person is thin, their bones and muscles are good." Science has proven that this sentence contains a great deal of truth. Previously, Hentig in his book "New Nutrition" had a statistic that among 100,000 people, the ratio of mortality rates for thin, fat, and neither thin nor fat people was: 100 to 158 to 154. Recently, Professor Ke Shi Katuo of the University of Berlin conducted a practical study on this issue of "being thin is better than being fat" using animals. He first fed dozens of white mice with a mixture of nutritious substances such as milk and white bread, and then separated the thin ones from the fat ones, subjecting each to attacks by toxic bacteria. As a result, the mortality rate of the fat ones was much higher than that of the thin ones. Similarly, alcohol poisoning also showed a similar pattern. Therefore, based on this, we can conclude that: being thin is better than being fat!</p>

<p>Prices of various bonds rise by 2 to 7 jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, it was rumored that President Wang had already returned to Beijing, Minister Song would also return to Beijing soon, and Huang Fu had already gone north from Beijing, dispelling rumors of Jiang and Song being tired of their duties. The remaining troops in North China's Ji Province were merely a matter of post-war settlement. However, the government's financial difficulties were undoubtedly a reality that could not be concealed. The Japanese were also gradually becoming more blatant in their dealings with China, and the future should not be viewed with excessive optimism.

As a result, prices generally rebounded by 2 to 7 jiao. The entire day's rise was driven by the purchases of over three million by No. 54 and No. 47.

However, near the close of the market, rumors of an imminent devaluation of the US dollar caused a sudden rebound, especially in steel and goods stocks. The total number of shares traded for the day was 1,000,000. "Wheat" is hoping for political stability so that panic will disappear and confidence will be restored. The market is still good, with an upward trend.

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. Sales of spot yarn are gradually picking up. A certain factory is holding tight on long positions, and their thinking is quite firm. At the same time, there is some active procurement from customers. However, sellers believe the environment is poor, all prices are falling, and Japanese yarn prices are still cheaper than Chinese yarn. However, current actual demand is still good, and the market is firm.</p>

<p>The human auction market opened weakly due to the collapse of money shops and banks, falling by four or five jiao. In the second and third sessions, the market rose again due to good news about spot yarn, and the result was an increase of one, three, or four jiao for each month. The afternoon opening was very good, but the second and third sessions fell, with near months rising by one or two jiao and distant months falling by two or three jiao. The total volume traded for the day was 45,500 bales. It was found that Sen Kang sold 1,000 bales, Ren Feng 1,000 bales, Yi Cheng 1,400 bales, Tong Xing 650 bales, and Sui Long 650 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is trending upwards because the trading volume of October flower auction is very large. Most cotton merchants are in a long position. It is rumored in the business community that there is a squeeze. However, a certain manufacturer continues to sell off. The spot cotton sales market is sluggish, and the factories' intentions are quite slack. According to some sources, the price in various producing areas is still cheap, and the future situation is lacking in confidence. It is estimated that cotton production will be reduced by about 900,000 dan compared to the previous estimate.</p>
<p>Near Months of Zheng Cotton are Good by Four Jiao The Zheng Cotton market opened in the previous session, and the market atmosphere was still flat. It rebounded firmly in the second and third auctions, with each month rising by 1.5 to 3.5 jiao. In the afternoon, some manufacturers closed out their long positions, and the market was slightly weak. The current month fell by one jiao, and the distant months were flat. The total trading volume for the day was 15,400 dan. It was found that Sui Long sold 6,400 dan, Feng 3,000 dan, Heng De 3,600 dan, Tong Xing 6,000 dan, Yuan Tai 4,000 dan, Heng Chang 3,700 dan, Shen Chang 2,300 dan, and Da Feng 1,900 dan.

<h3 id="e235">The Second Estimated Report of National Cotton Production in 1933 <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced the second estimate of national cotton production in 1933 as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area 39,684,369 Mu</p>
<p>Ginned Cotton Production 9,838,286 Dan</p>
<p>Abandoned Field Area 575,091 Mu</p>
<p>The above estimate is based on (1) reports from eleven provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, as well as Shanghai and Tianjin; (2) it is based on the cotton crop conditions before September 25; (3) the losses suffered by cotton crops in various provinces before September 25 have been included in the calculation; (4) cotton fields are measured in Chinese Mu, and cotton production is measured in Dan (100 catties per Dan).</p>
<p>The first and second estimates of this year are compared with the estimated numbers of cotton field production in previous years as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area (Mu) Ginned Cotton Production (Dan)</p>
<p>1919 35,037,881 9,028,390</p>
<p>1920 28,327,297 6,750,403</p>

<p>First Estimate 39,157,446 10,754,451</p>
<p>Second Estimate 39,684,369 9,858,286</p>
<p>The national cotton production this year was generally good in the first estimate, and there were high expectations for a bumper harvest. However, several provinces suffered from severe drought. At that time, the estimated cotton production in eleven provinces was 10,734,451 dan, with an average of over 27 catties of ginned cotton per mu. If the drought-stricken areas had timely rain, the average yield per mu could have reached 30 catties. Unexpectedly, after the first estimate, the drought-stricken areas had little rain, and the development of cotton crops was affected. Although the weather was sunny in autumn, it was only able to barely break even. In addition, the flood in Shandong Province, the flooding in Cao District, the unresolved drought in central Henan, and the flooding of the Han River in Shaanxi also caused reduced production. Finally, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces suffered from two wind and rain events in September, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, although Hubei and Hebei provinces increased slightly, the average situation has slightly deteriorated.</p>
<p>In summary, the total cotton field area in the eleven provinces this time is 39,684,369 mu, an increase of 526,923 mu compared to the first estimate. Because the first survey this year was earlier, the late-planted areas in June had not yet finished planting, so the cotton field area increased this time. If the number of abandoned fields is added, the cotton field area planted this year reaches 40,259,460 mu, the highest number in the last ten years. The total cotton production is 9,838,286 dan, a decrease of 896,165 dan compared to the first estimate this year. Compared with the actual harvest in 1932, it increased by 1,732,649 dan, which is still the highest production in the last ten years. The average yield per mu was 27.2 catties in the first estimate, but it has now dropped to 24.8 catties, a decrease of 2.4 catties. There will be a third estimate, which will be released on December 15.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Various gangs' sources are scarce. Arrivals include No. 3 and 4 from Chang Gang, No. 7 from Su Tong Gang, No. 3 from Nan Gang, No. 4 from Qingjiao Gang, No. 4 and 5 from Songjiang Gang, and No. 1 each from Fengjing. A total of twenty-four or five ships. The market situation is similar to yesterday, and sales are still very few, with a total of over 1,000 bags of Bao Wei Japonica and Premium. However, the price is firm due to the lack of goods, and yesterday there was an increase. It is estimated that the market prices of Chang Gang, Su Tong Gang, Nan Gang and other Japonica, and Qingjiao, Songjiang and other thin rice have all increased by a jiao. New and old premiums have also improved by nearly a chi, and new Japonica is rising in price. New Baiyuan is also quite outstanding.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Arrivals from the lower reaches of the river are twenty-one or two ships, and the number of ships in stock is small. Purchases are quite active, and the market is rising. The prices of Japonica, new Yang Premium, and Du Premium have increased by nearly a jiao. Medium and second-class broken Japonica, new western Japonica, Baiyuan, and thin rice have increased by two jiao. New Bu Premium and Chen Yang Premium are also quite outstanding.</p>

<p>- Continued Slight Cornering of Zhongguan Goods -</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of premium Xiang rice was very brisk, with the most arriving by train from Nanjing. Hunan rice also arrived in two or three batches. In addition to trains, steamer shipments of Jiangbei machine rice also arrived. A batch of new Anqing machine Xiang rice arrived directly for the first time, and subsequent batches of new Jiangxi machine early rice have also arrived in Shanghai. The market supply and arrival are both brisk, and the market is generally soft. However, high-quality goods and premium goods are still actively traded, and the market can still hold its ground. The price of Zhongguan and lower goods has slightly decreased by a few cents or nearly a jiao. The Quanzhou market in the whole city has more demand, and the Ningbo gang is also not weak. This street is only for social occasions. The Fuzhou gang also continues to procure and ship. The Quanzhou gang purchased 2,000 bags of Nanjing machine Xiang rice at a price of 7 yuan to 6.96 yuan, 200 bags of Jiangbei machine rice at a price of 6.92 yuan to 6.7 yuan, and 300 bags of Jiaxing Yang Premium at a price of 7.6 yuan. The Ningbo gang shipped 1,000 bags of Hunan brown rice at a price of 5.6 yuan. Fuzhou shipped 300 bags of Youjin rice at a price of 6.52 yuan. Anqing machine rice was 414 bags at a price of 6.7 yuan to 6.5 yuan. Jiangxi new machine early rice was 34 bags at a price of 6.3 yuan. This street shipped 400 bags of Jing rice at a price of 5.67 yuan to 5.38 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Wheat Flour Auction: Long Positions Heavily Recoil <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat flour market opened in the morning, the prices of various months showed a trend of first stabilizing and then falling. The quoted price of foreign wheat flour fluctuated by about one jiao, so the market was still stable when it first opened. The current month opened at 2 jiao and 5 li, but the opening price was unstable afterwards. Due to the poor outcome of the previous month and the unchanged and difficult environment, the general external long positions were in an even more desperate situation. Therefore, there were repayments in each session, and the market atmosphere became weak. When the afternoon market opened, the repayments for the current month were even greater, and the lowest price was 1 jiao and 7 fen. After that, there were some short coverings, and the market stabilized slightly. Distant months also showed a declining trend due to the unloading of long positions and the lack of interest from the customer gang. It is observed that it may still be difficult to support the situation in the future. As a result, the current month fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous month, November and December fell by 2.5 fen, January and February fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li, and the March opening price was 2 yuan and 2 jiao and 9 fen, and the closing price also fell slightly by 3 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday's period wheat market declined sharply across all months after the opening of the market in the morning and afternoon. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat fluctuated by one jiao, the market atmosphere inevitably turned to wait-and-see due to the weakness of flour sales. Therefore, each month fell slightly by two or three fen after the opening price. When the afternoon market opened, the weakness of the flour market was even greater, and it was rumored that Australian wheat may be approaching. One saying is that a certain factory has traded 3,000 bags of No. 3 wheat at a price of only 4.1 yuan. If this saying is confirmed, then the wheat market will of course be unable to be contained. Therefore, the opening prices of each month were also declining step by step. As a result, the current month fell by 5 fen compared to the previous month, November and December fell by 6 fen, February fell by 6 fen, and the rest were unchanged. The current wheat market is very quiet due to the factory's lack of appetite. The handover of September period auction wheat has already been completed, with a total of 37 trucks of spot wheat being delivered. Most of them were taken by experts, and a few were taken by hedging households. Factories did not directly inquire.</p>

<p>There has been no actual transaction of foreign company rapeseed for a long time. Recently, the buying and selling parties have resumed their intentions, and the price difference is only about one qian. Yesterday, one seller slightly loosened the asking price, so 1,200 bags were traded. The price of Wuhu goods opened at five taels and four qian ("equivalent to 7.56 yuan"), for the consumption of the Dong gang. It was found that this batch of goods fell by 5 or 6 qian compared to the peak of the rising trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was weak due to the limited transactions. The guild's price for second-grade coarse granulated white common goods was initially 21.6 yuan, but later a few hundred bags were traded at 5.5 jiao. However, there was a severe lack of outgoing orders, and the situation was tightening. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 20.8 yuan. The stock of Dutch No. 8 and 9 raw sugar was not large, and the asking price rose by one jiao to 16.5 yuan, but it was not sold. Tai Koo Sugar B mark was 21.65 yuan, and the rest was the same as Customs. The prices of Zhonghua and Guohua brand rock sugar were slightly loose. Crystal rock sugar was 25 yuan, No. 1 rock sugar was 23.9 yuan, No. 2 rock sugar was 23.7 yuan, and No. 3 rock sugar was 22.9 yuan. Top-grade refined white sugar was 20.75 yuan, No. 1 was 5.5 jiao, No. 2 was 3.5 jiao, No. 3 was 1.15 jiao, and No. 4 was 19.95 yuan. The prices of all grades fell by half a jiao. Zhenxing Factory opened 25 bags of rock sugar chips at 21.5 yuan. Due to the upcoming Autumn Festival, there are not many transactions of Chaoqing sugar. It is expected to resume after the festival, and the market price should be firm.</p>

<p>The harvest of newly produced Quanzhou dried longan this year is extremely poor, with a total production of less than 20%. Therefore, the new dried longan has been delayed in arriving. It was found that the Funan ship arrived from Quanzhou yesterday, and the first batch of new goods has been transported to Shanghai, totaling over a thousand boxes. Among them, the new goods are less than half. It is said that the cost of the top-grade large-sized longan is over 80 yuan, and it can only be exchanged after the festival.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Yingzhuang, Jinlong, Xiehe, and other firms in the northeast and northwest of Wuyuan started handling Premium Mei tea. Huashang Hezhong Firm also had a large intake, and the market was quite active. However, due to the tight prices from overseas, the highest opening price was only 127 yuan, which was still unable to reach a higher level than before. In addition, there were scattered transactions of Zhen Mei, Zhu Tea, Gong Xi, and other items of the upper and middle grades. The sales price also turned firm due to the shortage of goods. However, the lower-grade Zhen Mei and Xiu Mei teas remained sluggish.</p>

<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>If my character were stronger, I could stay in Shanghai; although I have no martial arts, I would fight with my skull to resist the wolf's tooth club. If my character were weaker, I would jump into the sea on this moonlit night with the mournful sound of waves; I am not the only one who cannot live in this world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my character is between strong and weak. I cannot fight desperately, nor can I desperately commit suicide. So, I have to leave!</p>
<p>Where to go?</p>
<p>I cannot go deep into the mountains or dense forests; after all, associating with monsters is still a non-feasible idea. I want to live, and I still need to live among people. I want to leave the crowd in Shanghai and live in another crowd. In another crowd, the nets are not so dense, and the dead ends are not so many. I can still find a piece of land to manage my profession: start some fires and smelt some iron. Although crises are also lurking, they are not as urgent as in Shanghai. People with characters like ours can only survive like this. If even that place cannot survive, I may no longer love my life. However, now I am fleeing from Shanghai with my life.</p>
<p>Shanghai, you devil-infested Shanghai, I am leaving you.</p>
<p>"I am going south again. I laugh at how the phoenix and luan are tossed about this year, what is my mood like? Even if my writing amazes the world, it is just pale and weak on paper; what does the spring water have to do with me? The evening rain suddenly comes, and the wild geese disappear, amidst the vast mountains and autumn sounds, urging the guest to leave, leaving like water..."</p>
<p>These are Ding Ling's sentences again. Why do her words often move me? But how can I compare to her? How can a "fallen people" who do odd jobs in the cultural world have amazing writing? Although there are many authors in the current literary world who "become famous with a little emotion," how dare I hope for that! "Pale and weak on paper" is really irrelevant to society, but for myself, it will cause death. It is really not worth it to waste my energy and life like this. I'd better leave!</p>
<p>Goodbye, you devil-infested Shanghai. I am going to another crowd. But I do not have such a delusion: "I wish I could get three million gold coins, make friends with all the beautiful women and famous scholars, and make friends with all the chivalrous people of Yan and Han." I just want to go to the people who provide rice, wheat, cloth, and silk, to manage my profession; start some fires and smelt some iron.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Buddhist Socialism <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Christian socialism has already been discussed, and I want to talk about Buddhist socialism. But I have no connection with Buddhist scriptures, and I cannot say any great Buddhist principles. I just happened to read the Yuan Dynasty Zaju Anonymous's "Coming Debt," so I will base it on this miscellaneous drama.</p>
<p>"Coming Debt" tells the story of Pang Yun of Xiangyang in the Tang Dynasty giving up his wealth to become a Buddhist. It tells the story of Li Xiaoxian borrowing two silver coins from Layman Pang for business, and he should return four silver coins with principal and interest. Unfortunately, he lost his money and had no money to repay. One day, he passed by the county government and saw more than a dozen people tied up and beaten in the yamen, all because they owed the rich man money. He was shocked and worried and became ill. Layman Pang learned of the cause of the illness, and because he had been helping people in need, he thought it was to do good deeds, but who would have thought that it would become an injustice? He burned Xiaoxian's IOU in front of him and gave him two silver coins. Layman Pang returned home and burned the documents of money lent to people in recent years. Unexpectedly, the smoke soared into the sky, alarming the God of Increase of Fortune in the upper realm, who transformed into a scholar and asked Layman Pang under the name of Zeng Xinshi. The two discussed the use of money, and the Layman thought that money was evil. They agreed to meet again later and parted. In the evening, the Layman burned incense in the front and back yards of his house. He saw the suffering of the mill doctor Luo He beating the gong and driving the cow. He asked him to stop working and gave him a silver coin to make a living. The mill doctor got the silver but could not sleep all night and returned the silver. The Layman also heard the voices of donkeys, horses, and cattle at the back trough when he burned incense in the evening. The donkey said, "Brother horse, why did you come here?" The horse said, "I owed Layman Pang fifteen taels of silver, and I had nothing to repay him. After I died, I became a horse to repay him. Brother donkey, why did you come here?" The donkey said, "I owed Layman Pang ten taels of silver, and I had no money to repay him. After I died, I became a donkey to grind the mill for him. Brother cow, why did you come here?" The cow said, "Don't you know? When I was alive, I borrowed ten taels of silver from Layman Pang, and the principal and interest were twenty taels. I never repaid him, so I am now a cow to repay him." Layman Pang was shocked when he heard this and said, "Hey! It scares me to death! I originally did good deeds, but who would have thought that I would turn out to be doing bad deeds! Isn't this all coming debt!" So he called his family and told them what he had heard from the cattle and horses. He burned all the documents of his family's wealth. He gave each of the servants in the family one tael and a deed of freedom and sent them home. He sent all the cattle, sheep, donkeys, mules, and horses to Lushan Mountain to be released. All the gold, silver, treasures, jade utensils, and trinkets were sunk into the East China Sea. The whole family went to Lushan Mountain to grind bamboo and weave sieves for a living. Finally, the whole family attained enlightenment and became Buddhas.</p>
<p>This play contains problems such as high interest loans, employee treatment, livestock treatment, the abolition of money, the liberation of slaves, and the sacredness of labor. The central idea is an attack on the private property system. But the author could not find a proper solution and concluded with the Buddhist theory of cause and effect and reincarnation, hoping that the exploiting class would lay down their butcher knives. This kind of fantastic Buddhist socialism is naturally ridiculous in the eyes of people with correct ideas in modern times. Moreover, the play assumes that the poor class, who are exploited by landlords and creditors and unable to bear it, will have to become cattle and horses after death to repay their debts, which is even more unforgivable nonsense.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Demon's Lair – Impressions of Qingdao, Part Three <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>On one side of Zhan Mountain, the woods shelter four enormous gun emplacements, lined up like stone turtles craning their necks, their mouths facing the sea bay where the water meets the sky, and the clouds and mountains are vast.</p>
<p>These gun emplacements were built when the German Empire occupied Jiaozhou. Qingdao passed from German hands to Japanese hands, and then was "received" back from the Japanese. After enduring vicissitudes, what remains is this painful historical relic.</p>
<p>Now the gun emplacements are useless, but you can still go inside. The entrance is on the mountainside, where there is a mottled iron gate, covered with moss and vines.</p>
<p>Inside, it's just like a terrifying demon's lair!</p>
<p>There is boundless darkness, and a pungent odor permeates the gloomy air. The ground underfoot is damp and slippery, and stepping on it will make the hairs on your body stand on end. A child who guards the gun emplacements leads the way, holding a lit candle, moving faintly along a narrow alley. What your eyes see is: a trembling candlelight, a circle of dim yellow light, the child's head within the light, dilapidated walls; besides these, there is nothing else. At this time, if you have any feelings, it must be the scenes of demon lairs described in fairy tales that come to mind.</p>
<p>But what is in front of you is not a mountain cave filled with jagged rocks, nor is there a residence for giants and elves – a magnificent and exquisite mysterious palace.</p>
<p>It is the modern architecture we often see, killing machines made of white stone and steel. There is a railroad track for transporting vehicles underground, leading directly outside; overhead there are steel rails for transporting artillery shells. Inside, in addition to the places where the gun positions are installed, there are many small rooms: this is where the generators are installed, that is where the artillerymen rest; this is the kitchen where food is cooked, and the rusted large iron pot is full of mud, said to be beef; that is the infirmary for wounded soldiers, and in the blurred light, the child who leads the way points to the spots on the wall: "These are bloodstains of wounded soldiers."</p>
<p>From these places, you can imagine how, years ago, those young German soldiers lurked in narrow cellars, moved the machinery of the cannons, and fired fiercely at the enemy, calmly and unhurriedly doing the work of killing.</p>
<p>But they were not evil demons either. They were young people deceived by the doctrine of iron and blood, they killed many brothers of different races like themselves, and as a result, they themselves became wandering souls in a foreign land. Perhaps those spots on the wall are their blood and tears of repentance.</p>
<p>The place is more than a mile long, and the other side is also a rusted iron gate. Only when you go out from there do you see the bright sunshine again. It is said that when this huge project was built, none of the Chinese residents of Qingdao knew about it; it was not until the German soldiers withdrew that these destroyed gun emplacements were discovered. Poor Chinese people, they are often killed in a dreamlike state.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Yuan Zhonglang as an Official (Continued) <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>He called himself a "messenger on the go" (like Guan Ning in his early days), and even said, "The suffering of holding documents is worse than being ill; the pleasure of clerical work is more hateful than medicine" (with Huangfu Erquan), and believed that "since taking the position of Magistrate of Wu, it has been like wearing a thousand layers of iron armor," and only "without officialdom is one's body light" (with Xi Weichang). Official life, in his conclusion, is simply "one day in office, one day in living hell" (with Luo Yin Nan), and being an official is like "a bitter ascetic monk" (with Wang Baigu) only! Therefore, "when the elders of the village presented a petition," he "would write on the back of the paper" (with Liu Zigan), saying:</p>
<p>Far from home, my heart is lazy, how can I be a wandering official;</p>
<p>Little food, many affairs, I fear I am a guest of eternal sleep!</p>
<p>You can imagine how much Zhonglang suffered from being an official. However, in fact, he had another layer of suffering, that is, he was originally a carefree, unrestrained person, and if you forced him to engage in such a busy and lowly life all day long, completely cutting him off from his past life, he could not help but feel uncomfortable. In his letter to "Lan Ze Yun Zeshu," he once mentioned this matter:</p>
<p>The capital city is prosperous, but being an official is suffering. Why? Boats, pens, drums, singing boys, and dancing girls are the affairs of generous guests, not the affairs of officials. Strange flowers, rare plants, dangerous rocks, and lonely peaks are the sights of reclusive men, not the sights of officials. Wine parties, poetry clubs, vermillion gates, purple lanes, shaking clothes on the peak of Mo Li, and washing feet on the stone of Tiger Hill, are the pleasures of tourists, not the pleasures of officials. What the officials face are the grain chiefs with patched clothes, the cunning people with glib tongues, and the prisoners covered in lice.</p>
<p>A carefree and unrestrained person cannot be a "generous guest," a "reclusive man," or a "tourist" because he is an official. How can he not be indignant and seek to leave? This is why Zhonglang said the following words in his letter to Tang Yireng:</p>
<p>How many days does life have? In long forests and abundant grasslands, what is not suitable? Yet one makes oneself suffer so. Every time I look at Tao Qian, it is not that he did not desire to be an official, nor that he did not hate poverty, but the desire to be an official could not overcome his love of ease, and the hatred of poverty could not overcome his厭厭of toil, so he finally returned, preferring to beg for food rather than regret it. Why did Zhonglang not want to be an official? This is also one of the reasons, "Officialdom is tiring, far不如carefree散散can suit one's ambitions" (with Tao Shikui). To understand Zhonglang's ambitions, you can see the whole picture in this letter. A life that is not suitable for him is forced upon him, how can he not "accumulate fatigue and become ill," and indignantly resign from office? In the past, when reading the family letters of Wu Linzheng, who died for the country at the end of the Ming Dynasty, there was a saying, "Although I have an honest heart, people will also forgive me, but every time I wake up in the middle of the night, I think I am not a person of the official path," like Zhonglang, judging from his temperament, he is not a "person of the official path"!</p>

<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>In this way, we sat opposite each other across a square table, not saying anything, each of us thinking about different things in our hearts; she must be wondering about this ridiculous man, who used money to recruit a woman who would not refuse no matter what, but was so civil; at the same time, I was thinking, although it was the power of money that brought us together – she sacrificed her body for a night to get a few dollars, and I spent a few dollars to indulge my lust for a night, but for me, this matter did not seem so simple at all. "You called me here, why don't you say anything?" Finally, she could not bear it anymore and said something like this. "I don't speak your language!" I still replied to her happily like this.</p>
<p>I knew that this woman did not understand my words either, although when I asked her, "Do you understand my words?" she replied, "I understand, I can also speak Mandarin." But even her Mandarin, I still could not understand.</p>
<p>"Could it be that you don't 'fancy' me?" Although she said this with a smile, there was a pitiful look in her smile. "No, absolutely not!" In order to reassure her, I could not help but answer like this.</p>
<p>But then I did not know what to say, and the silence continued for a long time. She nervously touched the purse she had brought, looking around, looking at the wall, looking at the ceiling, she seemed unable to understand what she had come here to do.</p>
<p>I understood very well how much embarrassment she was enduring in her small heart, which was accustomed to enduring pain, because if you bluntly answered her "I don't fancy you," she would smile charmingly and pounce on you, trying to make you fancy her; but now, the dull air of this dirty little room, and that face that smiled at her but was actually devoid of warmth, made her not know how to deal with it, all her tricks were useless. This was simply a more severe insult than anything else for her.</p>
<p>Although I understood her state of mind very well, I could not think of anything to say, partly because of the language barrier, and partly because in this kind of environment, I really did not know what kind of words to say. After thinking hard for a long time, I finally said this:</p>
<p>"Why don't you go to bed and sleep for a while?" As I said this, I used gestures to help my words, so that she could understand what I meant. She smiled contemptuously, obviously she misunderstood what I meant, but I did not want to argue. Because in this kind of environment, I had already become her slave, and if I could reduce the unease in her heart, I would be infinitely comforted. So I still looked at her with a smiling face, watching her unbutton her buttons. Under her white silk cheongsam, there was a light red undershirt, and two small nipples were slightly protruding inside. The flames of lust that had been suppressed in my chest were burning again.</p>
<p>"Turn your face away, don't look!" She deliberately said these words shyly. But these words were full of temptation, and my heart was beating violently.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I really lowered my head, picked up a pen at hand, and scribbled on the paper. When she took off her clothes and wrapped her body in the quilt, I heard her shout "Silly boy!" as if she had discovered something.</p>

<p>On the Topic of Occupations Wen Bing</p>
<p>In the present situation where rural economies are withering and urban markets are experiencing recession, with a double dose of intensification, related professions have long since become an enormous problem. Countless people have circulated outside the circle of occupations for years, but still find themselves jobless and unable to be employed, forming a widespread unemployed panic amongst those who are adrift and hungry. So, what is there to say about occupations? However, in reality, there are indeed many people who have achieved success in finding employment, and this is certainly one of life’s greatest questions. Everyone should have some recognition and understanding of this, so it is worth discussing.</p>
<p>The definition of the two characters for “occupation” can be found in dictionaries as: “The undertaking which one ought to perform within one’s role,” a meaning that seems too vague. I remember hearing a lecture on occupations by Mr. Jiang Hengyuan once, and his explanation was roughly as follows: “Duty is responsibility, and the undertaking is business. To do business with a sense of responsibility is called an occupation, and its journey is to benefit both oneself and others, in order to fulfill humanity’s divine task.” This kind of explanation from the literal meaning still cannot satisfy us. From an economic perspective, the so-called occupation is originally no more than a behavior that occurs in a certain fixed way, in order to obtain the means of living. Saying it this way, a certain object is merely economic, and the meaning is inevitably too narrow. We believe that the explanation of an occupation should be a kind of inevitable and necessary life activity of humanity, the course of which is to solve the problem of living and promote human society.</p>
<p>Here it is necessary to briefly state the meaning of humanity: one is to live, and the other is how to be able to live. Because to live, one needs the provision of clothing, food, and shelter. Because one needs the provision of clothing, food, and shelter, one needs life activities, which is to say, one needs to seek what is needed for life from one’s own labor. Today, of course, there are many people who, by relying on the private ownership system and social forces, can live comfortably without working. But this is obviously a distortion of the meaning of humanity, a morbid social phenomenon, the collapse of which is bound to come in the near future. Therefore, in the final analysis, humanity should have life activities, which is to say, humanity should have an occupation.</p>
<p>Because an occupation is so important to the meaning of life, the mutual relationship is also the closest. We know that if it is an occupation, it must have permanence, and it is like a shadow that closely follows one’s life forward every day. Therefore, at the beginning of employment, it is necessary to think carefully and cautiously. First, one must consider one’s own interests. Second, one must see whether one’s talents and abilities are a good match. Third, one must see how one contributes to society in general. These are the three basic conditions. A person with a scientific mind whose interests are very close to industrial occupations, but who goes to serve as an editor for a literary magazine, the result is bound to be that he himself feels bored and nothing is achieved. A junior high school graduate is asked to be an elementary school principal, which is also beyond his abilities. If an organization that manufactures and sells red pills, opium, and gambling equipment has a job for you, even if it is a good position, you should not rashly take it, because it violates the third condition. Not only is there no general social contribution, but it is simply a den of sin that harms society and the human masses. It cannot be said to be an occupation.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the beginning of employment, it is necessary to be strictly cautious, and the occupation that is obtained in accordance with the conditions must be one where talent is suitable for the occupation, and the occupation is suitable for talent. Then one should "respect one's work," "enjoy one's work," and "persevere in one's work." In fact, if it can be so allocated, then everyone who is unemployed will have work, everyone who has work will enjoy it, and everyone will work hard for the individual and for society as a whole.</p>
<p>However, the current society is too contradictory. There are many people who have no means of living and have to beg for food, who often have nothing to do. At the same time, there are people who have money, who often eat without working. People who can work and are willing to work often have nothing to do for them. People who cannot work often occupy the positions of those who can work, taking large amounts of money and eating well. In the final analysis, it is extremely difficult to seek employment now. Besides having the qualities of flattery and boasting, and having the support of power,</p>
<p>Society is like this, I will not say more. What I hope is that friends who already have an occupation and those who are seeking an occupation with certainty should thoroughly recognize the essence and importance of an occupation, and not be careless or negligent.</p>
<h3 id="e249">To a Deceased Friend Bin Fu <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>My friend was an ordinary person, but "death" is an extraordinary thing -- at least we ordinary people think it is -- and an extraordinary thing has actually befallen my ordinary person. I can't help but feel something, I cried.</p>
<p>In this day and age, it is extremely common for extraordinary people to suffer extraordinary deaths. However, that an ordinary person like you should die so easily, I simply cannot believe it!</p>
<p>When I received the news of your death, the "death notice" really couldn't make me believe it. I presumptuously made a phone call to your father, whom I did not know, and learned that your father had just returned to Shanghai from Hankou and was about to return to his hometown to prepare your body, which proved that you had indeed been taken by the god of death. In this unfamiliar conversation between two people, your father cried sadly, cried so much that I couldn't hear what he was saying, so much that I couldn't listen anymore, and I hung up the phone.</p>
<p>You and I had six years of close friendship. Needless to say, your death is a deep pain to me, but my sorrow is really nothing compared to your father's wailing, your mother's heartbreak, your eighty-year-old grandmother's grief, and your newlywed wife's disheveled hair and clawing face! It's really nothing!</p>
<p>Like you, an honest person who never violated the world or offended anyone, I don't think you would have any resentment towards "death." As the Greek Lucian said: "... Hunger, thirst, and cold are no longer your lot! You are gone, beyond the power of disease, ... love can no longer disturb your peace, harm your health, or invade your purse, ... you will not go to that hateful old age again, nor will you be an eyesore to your descendants again! ..." Death may be a kind of love for you.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the grief of your grandmother, parents, and wife is the only thing you are uneasy about, but how can we stop their grief!</p>
<p>I cannot experience what good there is in life, I cannot imagine what defects there are in the "underworld," and after careful thought, I have no reason to be sad for your departure!</p>
<p>September 22nd, on an autumn night with lamp light and rainy evening.</p>

<h3 id="e250">For the Sake of Money Shi Ben <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>(A scene of social darkness!)</p>
<p>The world is declining day by day, and morality and shame are lost – there is actually such a brazen woman in broad daylight, in a bustling city, disregarding shame and boasting about her ugly history of carnal instincts. Perhaps in the bizarre and lascivious Shanghai metropolis of the human flesh market, this is a common and unremarkable scene! But when I, an old country bumpkin who is still connected to "moral concepts," heard it, I couldn't help but be astonished and horrified.</p>
<p>"Dead turtle! Roadside corpse! Have you forgotten? Three years ago, you came to Shanghai with nothing in your hands, who made you what you are today? If it wasn't for this old woman risking her life, losing her face, and letting people sleep with her snow-white body! How could you be where you are today. It's not that I'm shameless to say it. It's not that I crave pleasure, it's for the sake of money that I gritted my teeth and endured the pain, alas! I worked hard for three years, and finally earned some money, but now you're enjoying it, not only eating ready-made meals, but also going out to whore and gamble every day, and that whore is your confidante, and you take money so lightly! Humph! This money didn't come easily, it's this old woman's blood (of course not "tendon") and sweat, every coin has bloodstains on it! Can it withstand you dancing, watching operas, and keeping women like a young master's life of luxury? Wouldn't you squander the few stinking money I earned with my body? Dead turtle! To be honest with you, if you dare to continue wasting money like this, I'll cut you off completely! See what you'll rely on to live then?" On the bustling ×× Road, where cars and horses were shuttling back and forth, the boss lady of a single-fronted cigarette and paper store, roaring angrily, with her willow eyebrows standing on end, her almond eyes wide open, her face turning ashen, was pounding the table and bench in the store, flying into a rage, and scolding her trembling husband, who was standing in the corner of the counter, with his head hanging down.</p>
<p>The sound of scolding and cursing alarmed the people coming and going on the road, and in an instant, many people gathered on the sidewalk to watch the fun. At the same time, everyone was secretly whispering: "Look! How pitiful this man is! His face is pale and he is shrinking in the corner, timidly not saying a word in return, letting this she-tiger scold him endlessly without any restraint, it's a shame he's a man, he's so afraid of his wife!" A person in the crowd said indignantly.</p>
<p>"It's not that he's afraid of his wife, he's afraid of 'money'! Did you hear? He relies on his woman's ability to eat and drink, of course he should be subject to her control, how dare he resist her?" Another said this way. "Such loud吵吵吵吵吵吵ing, isn't it embarrassing for others to laugh at? Alas! Don't wash your dirty laundry in public!" A Taoist student said with a sigh. "There are countless tricks of 'women supporting men' on the Shanghai Bund! There are piles of fat cats who eat fine food and rely on women to make a living!" "Brother, you're right! Not to mention small people, relying on women's faces! Even some of the famous big shots now, many of them rely on the luck of their female relatives."</p>
<p>"Dead turtle! Roadside corpse ... this money is your woman's snow-white body ... pain ..." The boss lady was still scolding endlessly. He in the corner, after hearing so many people outside saying cold words and sarcastic remarks, and she was constantly exposing her own ugliness, suddenly became ashamed and angry, his face turning red and white, his eyebrows standing on end, his teeth clenching, thinking of hitting her, but then he suddenly remembered how poor he was when he came to Shanghai empty-handed three years ago! If it weren't for his wife's ability, and she had hooked up with Old Man Zhang, how could he be where he is today? This stinking skin would have been buried among the white poplars and barren grass long ago, and would he still have the good fortune to be a boss in a big city? Besides, his wife now has twenty or thirty thousand in hand, so for the sake of money, he had to endure it! Face doesn't matter, anyway, now it's "only serving the clothes, not the person." So his body softened again, and the hand he was preparing to hit her with involuntarily retracted, his face burning hot, his head dizzy, still not moving in the corner. "Woo woo woo" A bright and dazzling car arrived and stopped at the entrance of the ×× cigarette and paper store, the car door opened, and an elderly man with a mustache, wearing a gentleman's outfit, with a cigarette in his mouth, stepped in. The boss lady, who had a face full of anger and murderous intent, instantly became soft and smiling, greeting him happily and walking hand in hand with the old man. This ugly drama also came to a sudden end.</p>
<h3 id="e251">"Extremely Ordinary Things" Zhi <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>After teaching for two hours in night school, with today's salary of one dollar and forty cents just received in my pocket, I moved my tired body heavily to the bus stop on Nanjing Road with an unknown feeling of joy, sorrow, relief, or bitterness. It was at this stop that I encountered something that many people would say was an "extremely ordinary thing." -- Really, this thing is both "ordinary" and simple.</p>
<p>In front of the gate of a brightly lit ham store, a large crowd of people gathered. In the core of the crowd, I found four people who could draw my attention: one was a rickshaw puller who was still panting and whose short shirt was soaked with sweat, revealing his chest, and in his dark and rough palm he was holding "eight small coins" that looked strangely unsightly, and it seemed that his heart was filled with a belly of grievance and unsuppressible anger; two were dignified "gentlemen" in blue uniforms holding police batons; and one was a young shop assistant dressed neatly like a gentleman, who was gesticulating, but was speaking to our "gentlemen" with a kindly and softly manner, explaining his reasons. Our "gentlemen" crossed their arms in front of their chests, leisurely listening like a judge examining a prisoner.</p>
<p>"How far is it from here to Ferguson Road? We agreed on five dimes; because I couldn't find the destination, I asked him to pull me back. I added thirty cents, and he made me run in vain, so I paid him eighty cents in total. I ask you, gentlemen, did I owe him anything?"</p>
<p>"Is this your reasoning? No matter what, it's been almost three hours since I started pulling at six thirty, and I've run dozens of miles. I haven't even had dinner yet!" A trembling, but really angry, voice spewed out of the throat of this stubborn worker like rising smoke. Then, our "gentlemen" interrogated him coldly and briefly:</p>
<p>"So, how much do you think you should get?"</p>
<p>"In principle, I should get at least ten dimes."</p>
<p>"Add twenty cents."</p>
<p>A victorious smile floated on the face of the young shop assistant dressed like a gentleman. Obeying the "gentlemen's" judgment, he counted out twenty cents to the rickshaw puller; but the rickshaw puller was still arguing righteously and not agreeing. So</p>
<p>"Pig! You don't know what's good for you! I'm helping you, and you don't appreciate it at all? Get out!" The police baton was raining down on the frame of the car. So the rickshaw puller dragged the car away in a panic.</p>
<p>Next, there were these varied discussions from the onlookers:</p>
<p>"You don't need to talk nicely to this kind of guy: if you give him a little color, he'll want to open a dye house. A petty person is always a petty person!"</p>
<p>"The rule is three dimes an hour for a rickshaw."</p>
<p>"If you don't speak fiercely at the beginning, and ask for more money nicely and kindly, people will always be willing to add it."</p>
<p>"…………………"</p>
<p>Moving forward, I was squeezed into a corner. "Three dimes an hour," "If you want to add money, you have to speak nicely" I repeated to myself.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Longing After Farewell Due To <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>It was an afternoon in late autumn, at the foot of Zhao Bao Mountain, only some scattered rocks and withered grass remained. The faint setting sun was slanting upon the silent Zhongshan Mountain. Waves of geese were calling to each other, all flying down into the reed marshes. Flocks of crows were cawing noisily, flying south. There was a wisp of floating cloud in the sky, and the pure blue sky, apart from the flying and calling geese formations and crow flocks, was completely unadorned. The harsh wind was blowing against the withered grass on and around the mountain, seeming to play a kind of bleak music. I looked up and saw a ship with yellow smokestacks moving straight ahead, slowly about to sail out of the harbor. She—she is my mother!—how is she pondering her only beloved son on the ship? A week of time has passed so quickly. Now my mother has left me again, drifting far away on the boundless ocean. I am a helpless orphan; my father has returned to the yellow earth, sleeping peacefully on the top of Sand Crab Ridge. Even if I desperately and sorrowfully call out "Dad!", he would still ignore me. He and I are now separated by the realms of life and death, with no hope of reunion. Now my mother has also gone far away. The smoke from the smokestacks is drifting farther and farther, eventually disappearing and becoming invisible! Ah! How unbearable it is in my heart! My mother has been taken away by that merciless and cruel ship. This hateful, cursed ship, aren't you too cruel?</p>
<p>The words my mother嘱咐 told me before boarding the ship are now replaying clearly in my mind, and I feel that every word and every sentence contains great love. Such loving words, there is definitely no one else in the world who can say them! At that time, I felt that my life could not be separated from her love. So I wandered on the small path at the foot of the mountain, gazing at the dome-shaped azure sky and the vast sea. However, I felt apathetic to everything in nature. In my eyes, only my mother's image was very clearly reflected. Another flock of geese flew across the sky, with a burst of loud cries, which instantly broke the surrounding silence. On this bleak autumn evening, hearing a few loud cries in the long sky made me even more melancholic and hesitant. Looking at the surrounding gray-yellow, bleak, and deserted cliffs, I felt a deep, heavy, boundless, and indescribable sense of misery in my heart! The setting sun had completely sunk, and the remaining red light in the west was still shining obliquely on the earth. The mountain had changed from a floating purple to a deep gray. The harsh wind was blowing even harder, making me shiver involuntarily!</p>

<p>Ding! Ding! Ding! The school bell rang, and male and female students walked into the first classroom shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p>Everyone walked into the classroom, and each student's gaze first focused on the few lines of chalk writing on the blackboard at the front, something about "New Mencius," something about "Western-style houses are what I desire, beautiful women are also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up the Western-style house and choose the beautiful woman."</p>
<p>As everyone was laughing in bursts, I heard the sound of slippers walking behind me, seemingly approaching. Sure enough, Mr. Chen, who was nearly forty years old and had a haggard face, came in.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen walked onto the platform and began to say, "This class is about practical writing." After saying that, he took the chalk and copied the company organization law from the teaching book he brought, listing articles such as: one, name; two, purpose; and official document formats, such as requesting matters... earnestly requesting review and implementation, and other formats.</p>
<p>After copying a large paragraph, he took a cigarette from the cigarette case, lit it, and smoked it hard. Suddenly, the room was filled with smoke, and the students seemed to be lost in a fog, which made everyone laugh incessantly. However, Mr. Chen, pretending to be taking classes in a university, continued to smoke his cigarette as usual, while continuing to copy on the blackboard.</p>
<p>S and W, who were known for their humor in the whole school, took advantage of Mr. Chen's back being turned to the students while writing on the blackboard to dance in pairs in the back, also singing English songs in low voices. At this time, the students laughed even harder, covering their mouths.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen finished copying to a certain point and left without waiting for the end-of-class bell to ring.</p>

<p>Confidential Secretary: Oh! About that, I already spoke to the Minister and decided to send Madam's brother.</p>
<p>Madam: Oh? You've already said that? Thank you so much! Did he agree then?</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Of course he agreed. He agrees with almost everything I say.</p>
<p>Orderly: Stop nagging, I found it. Damn it, I searched for a long time, and it was hidden in this bush.</p>
<p>Madam: Thank you so much!</p>
<p>Maid: Give it to me quickly.</p>
<p>Orderly: No, first give me a kiss.</p>
<p>Maid: No, give it to me first, then kiss. (They kiss through the window. The orderly quickly exits, and the maid also disappears.)</p>
<p>Madam: My brother has told me several times to recommend him to the Minister, but I keep telling him to wait a while, wait a while, and wait for an opportunity. Today, there is such a good opportunity. If Mr. He hadn't mentioned it, he would have forgotten about it again.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Hmph, the Minister is too busy with his affairs, and he often forgets such small matters.</p>
<p>Madam: What's busy or not, anyway, it's my business, so he doesn't take it to heart.</p>
<p>Orderly: (From outside) Secretary He! That group of wild dogs is here again. Should they be received?</p>
<p>Madam: Where did the wild dogs come from?</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Hahahaha, he's saying that the group of newspaper reporters is here again. The Minister often scolds them for being wild dogs. You should let them in. There's no way to get rid of these things.</p>
<p>Orderly: Yes! (Exits)</p>
<p>Madam: Wild dogs, that's an interesting new term. Since the wild dogs are here, I have to leave too.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Haha, but these kinds of dogs don't necessarily bite people, Madam.</p>
<p>Madam: Hahaha, they don't bite people, they just love to eat beef. If you give them beef, they will wag their tails at you and not bark. (Goes upstairs.)</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Ah, Madam's mouth is really venomous!</p>
<p>Madam: Am I venomous? You're the one who's good at it. Give them a whip and then a piece of beef, that's real skill. (Disappears) (A group of reporters, about six or seven people, swarm up.)</p>
