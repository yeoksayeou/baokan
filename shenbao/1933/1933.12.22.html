<h3 id="c24">日蘇關係之推移與世界經濟恐慌强化 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>遠東政局。自上月十六日美國正式宣布承認蘇聯後。即有日趨尖銳對立之勢。而在目前階段中。其根本癥結。尤在於日本大陸政策之積極進行不已。蓋吾人觀察日人近今之豪論。不惟有統治亞細亞之大志。且更抱有支配世界之雄心。惟欲支配世界。不得不先支配亞細亞。而欲支配亞細亞。必先封鎖蘇聯。故此滿洲統治之完成爲最可注意。而日蘇關係之推移。尤不可忽視也。</p>
<p>歷觀日本排斥蘇聯北滿勢力之行動。早知中東路購買談判爲雙方延宕之計。故自始即規劃建立一環狀鐵路。以圍困中東。繼而拘捕蘇聯路員。以破壞路政系統。最近復另派中東路局長。居於俄局長魯迪之上。以干涉鐵路管理權。蓋日本排斥蘇聯之用意。今茲已不復作掩藏之姿勢。而反觀蘇聯之態度。亦轉趨强硬。不復如前此之溫和。試觀本月十七日蘇聯向日僞所發極端嚴厲之警告。旣指出日僞之繼續排俄。爲故意施行之政策。以圖削減中東路之重要性。汰除蘇聯在中東財産上之權利。而以完全佔取該路爲最後目標。復聲明一切損害責任。當唯日僞是問。則蘇聯之聲色俱厲。已與日本之層層緊逼。針鋒相對矣。此際詎尙有從容迴旋之餘地哉。</p>
<p>惟當此世界極度恐慌之時。彼蘇聯之生産計劃。尙圖完成第二五年之工作。即使日本躍躍欲試。决計以武力相較。然蘇聯苟非於軍事準備已臻成熟。或德法關係即瀕破裂。或日本政局有所發展。則其當局亦必不致因中東路之爭執。而遽出全力相搏。矧中東之價値。無論軍事經濟。固早已如甕中之鼈乎。更就日本方面論。三年以來。雖盛修海陸軍備。與英美諸雄力爭殖民地。甚至强佔滿洲。盡情發揮威力。然終未能和緩日本國内之生産過剩。適使遠東局面更形緊張。且英美諸國見日本之盡力進行拓殖。大感日本經濟勢力之威脅。已一致早有戒心。故於此時。日本對蘇即欲一逞爲快。亦未必毫無所忌憚也。因是日本仍欲以紆絗曲折之方法。以冀曲達其統治亞細亞之目的。甚爲明瞭。則日蘇關係之前途。亦可想而知矣。</p>

<p>日艦代電通告　毓濟輪觸礁後、船頭陷没水内、輪體受頭二艙牽動、巳經傾斜、情勢險惡、船上無線電機、亦已損毁、不能通話、公司屢次去電呼呌、均無答應、及至二十日下午六時、日本海軍第二十七隊驅逐艦菱號、由馬公開回上海、經過冬瓜嶼、因毓濟中有日人船員、故即停泊、當經船主安部籐太郎、要求該艦代發無線電來滬、言毓濟頭二艙仍没入海水、請上海速派救護船到該處、進行營救工作、江元艦即於是晚開出、</p>
<p>議派技師工人　公司得此電訊、</p>
<p>立即轉知聯保保險公司、因來電有如往救護、一星期内可望修理竣工之意、遂經毓大聯保會同鴻昌機器廠磋商、雇派工程師一人、潛水夫一人、木匠四人、工人十二名、隨帶大批材料、並向耶松租用抽水機器一架、運往失事處、實施助救、當由聯保代付費用一千元、各項工人、統乘達興公司三江號輪、於昨日下午五時、從滬上開出、預計今日下午、可到溫州洋矣、船内載去食物甚夥、以供各船員食用、</p>
<p>旅客救到上海　該輪旅客、經江元艦救起、而載送來滬者、總共一百五十四名、已於昨日下午三時許進口、至四時三十五分、到高昌廟、當在海軍碼頭靠泊、計有搭客七十五名、馬尾海軍陳營學兵七十九名、亦乘毓濟輪來滬、由江元艦一併載來上海、另外毓濟輪二買辦一人、亦附江元來滬、艦到碼頭、海軍當局、派兵在碼頭照料、海軍練營學生上岸後、暫在高昌廟居住、聞不日即須往京、旅客到滬者、則各自散去、兵士與旅客、共帶來行李約一百餘件、而毓濟二買辦、即至永安街公司内、報告輪船失事經過、</p>
<p>旅客所述狀况　旅客中有某君向記者言、毓濟輪肇事、在十七日夜中、其時衆客已熟睡、聞警始醒、及至出艙觀看、頭二艙已進水、直至十八日上午、始有法郵船羅梭號到來救護、爲之代發電報至海軍部、直至下午五時、江元·楚觀·方始開抵、我等遂得轉換至江元艦内、因轉駁費時、而又遇風浪、故直至昨日午後啓行、今日得到上海、今次毓濟失事、旅客無一受傷、即行李物件、亦均取出、惟船内貨物、則已全部損失矣云云、</p>
<p>船員暫上燈塔　據毓濟二買辦到公司報告、謂船身一二兩艙破裂、幸機艙與後船尾完好、故一時不致下沉、船内全部船員、因食物已盡、刻下水手生火以及船員與業務部人、約五十餘人、均上東瓜山燈塔、候上海救護船運載食物、前往接濟、毓濟船身不致犧牲、可望救出、</p>
<p>軍艦保護工作　公司與聯保保險行、所派救護船及工人等、凖備一星期、修理船底破洞、及帮通抽水等工作、故海軍所派之楚觀、仍停留該處保護、而日本海軍第二十七隊菱號驅逐艦、亦徇船主安部之請、留泊在東瓜山、楚觀艦且派海軍多名、至東瓜山保衛船員、據公司方面言、毓濟之能否脫險、尙須俟三江到後、方有眞確消息也、</p>

<p>民國二十二年中國航空公司之槪况與將來發展之計劃　戴恩基</p>
<p>中國航空公司、爲中美兩國合資經營、開辦至今、已逾三　、旣承政府之指導、又得各界人士之贊助、與本公司同人之努力、故過去成績、尙能得社會人士之稱許、本年初、恩基奉命承乏其間、夙夜擘劃、不敢稍懈、尤兢兢致力於三大航綫之工作、計滬平綫於本年一月十日開航、渝蓉綫於本年十一月十一日開航、滬粤綫於本年十月廿四日開航、從此南北東西、得相銜接、中外人士、莫不稱便、而於渝蓉一綫、尤覺便利、蓋前者成都重慶、水陸兼行、十日方能到達、自今年十一月十一日之後、飛機以兩小時之時間、卽可歷千餘華里之路程、不復有蜀道難之感矣、</p>
<p>本公司鑒於上海漢口重慶成都、間商務之繁盛、客郵之發達、擬於明年夏間、改用最新式之飛機飛行、此種飛機、安穩舒適、其平飛速度爲一百五十英里、（約四百五十華里）、較現用之機、更快三分之一、如此則清晨離上海、正午到漢口、當日下午卽可將全部郵件送達、次晨離漢口、亦能於當日正午到成都、是則上海成都、不過兩日之行程、其在空中、僅十小時而已、</p>
<p>中國航空公司之歷史與成績、早已昭著於社會、賞爲吾國商業航空之巨擘、將來種種計劃、當能如期實現、茲將廿二年一月至十一月底、各項統計列左、</p>
<p>民國廿二年一月至十一月底所載乘客人數計二·三四九、</p>
<p>民國廿二年一月至十一月底乘客英里積八一九·六九三、</p>
<p>民國廿二年一月至十一月底所載郵件（以公斤計）四○·七六七</p>
<p>民國廿二年一月至十一月底飛行英里數目五七一·九一二、</p>
<p>由上觀察、吾國商業航空　在將來發展上、實有一日千里之勢、中國航空公司、爲迅速發展上之需要計、實以訓練人材、爲必要之圖、而發展上所需之種種設備、尤須急爲努力、庶不致成爲畸形之發展、故對於新式之製造、亦求在可能範圍内、達其自給之目的、</p>
<p>當本公司最初開辦之時、多僱用外籍人員、今則吾國人員有能勝任者、如無綫電一部、全屬吾國人員矣、其對於拆修飛機、今亦由吾國人員擔任、功效頗著、中美合同之存在期間、不過十年、今已三年有半矣、六年半之時間、轉瞬卽至、故人才之培植、不能稍緩、蓋將以備他年之用也、龍華飛機場之設備、已逐漸改觀、原欲築跑道二條、以便飛機之起落、其中一條、早已完工、吾國飛機塲向無跑道、此實爲嚆矢、第二條亦已興工、本年底當可完成、明春又將建築一新棚廠、期臻完備、當開辦時、該機場之簡陋、乘客中當有人想像及之、今昔相較、當不啻霄壤矣、</p>
<p>更有進者、目前中國航空公司、僅有國内飛行、祗載國内之郵件、預計不久、當可兼載國際間之郵件、此固本公司所旦夕跂望者也、</p>

<h3 id="c253">排猶 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>一九三三年快到終結。在這一年中，世界上發現的重大事件，當然很多，一排猶　也是其中之一。</p>
<p>日本現在是不再屠殺朝鮮人了，英國對印度似乎也客氣得多，法國是向來不大殺安南人的。他們雖都亡國，但流年總算不壞！</p>
<p>倒霉的是華僑！東趕西逐，悽慘得可以！其次就是猶太人了！</p>
<p>猶太和中國，可說是同等資格的古國。所不同的，猶太早就獲滅，而中國是還在苟延殘喘罷了！</p>
<p>但中國人在世界上的地位，似乎還不及早已亡國的猶太人。後者對世界確有相當的供獻，民族性也很團結，特别是他們有一種致富的本領。這些似乎是任何民族所不及的。假使中國和猶太陽地以處，那末，現在世界上有否中國民族的存在，倒是一個問題！</p>
<p>德國國社黨政府所以採取排斥「阿利安」種人政策，和猶太人爲難的最大理由，認爲是猶太人的勢力足以妨碍德國的生存。換言之，無非是廣義的嫉忌而已！猶太人對此當然不甘屈服，本人德籍的世界大科學家愛因斯坦，因此聲明脫離德籍而成爲英國的臣民。他們也開過民族大會，通過抵制德貨，請求國聯贊助猶太移民至巴勒斯豋等議决案。他們也喊過努力奮鬥，死而後已的口號。但歐洲不容他們立足，依然是事實。我們雖說没有嘗到亡國的苦味，但猶太人的「前車」不遠，總也足夠驚惕的了吧！</p>
<p>猶太人旣不能安居德國，又給歐洲失業的潮流所排擠。他們不願就此去死，他們急切地覓取生活，但是他們到那裏去！</p>
<p>於是他們就潮水般的瀉到中國來！</p>
<p>中國實在是一個好的去處！是各個列强的殖民地，是各國流亡的收容所！剥削的剥削，寄生的寄生。假使有人問我，中國人將來預備到那裏去？那末，這個問題，總也足夠驚惕的了吧！我們將來到那裏去呢！</p>
<h3 id="c254">靠鼻頭賺錢的嗅專家 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>家有萬貫家私，而身無一技之長的人，未必能夠永遠吃着不盡；身有一技之長，而家無分文遺産的人，未必永遠飢寒交迫。所謂「技」就是「本領」，有了「本領」，就可賺錢；賺了錢就可換飯吃。勞心的人靠頭腦來賺錢，轉念頭就是「本領」；勞力的人靠手足來賺錢，做事體就是「本領」。不論勞心勞力，靠頭腦轉念頭，靠手足做事體，能夠賺錢過活，都算好的了。</p>
<p>社會上普通一般賺錢過活的人，可以說總逃不出靠頭腦勞心或靠勞力的範圍。最近傳出一則新聞來，說勞心勞力靠頭腦靠手足之外，却多一種靠鼻頭來賺錢了。在英國一家製造香料香水的工廠中，有一個特别鼻頭，每年値二萬塊錢。原來廠中有一化騐師，對於嗅覺有特别訓練和研究，號稱「嗅專家」，他單靠鼻頭，便可以得到比别人增加幾倍的薪俸。所以一個好鼻頭是很値錢的；但是它的嗅覺一定要開始就敏銳非常，差不多祗要一嗅，便能辦明内中情形，訓練到這種地步，恐怕不是容易的。</p>
<p>配製各種香水，或把各種香料混合起來，是一種藝術。任何一種費盡心計，辛辛苦苦所製造的特别香水的成分中，配進極小的一滴，加得太多，或是太少，都足以使全部毁壞無遺。這種地方，就要請敎「嗅專家」了。他的鼻頭嗅了一下，立刻可以告訴他這種香水配得正確與否，假使配得不對，應該加些甚麽，他也可以嗅出來。還有一個靠鼻頭賺錢的「嗅專家」，他是受一班釀造所老閬的聘請，請他來檢查這些送回到釀造所來的舊空桶。他能夠靠了他的特别鼻頭，敏銳嗅覺，說出那一隻空桶，再裝了新的啤酒進去，十分安全；那一隻空桶，再裝了新的啤酒進去，便要變壞，除了查桶之外，在辨别酒的優劣方面，嗅覺也占有一重要地位的。</p>

<p>— 趙鵬</p>
<p>▲杜六思姑娘奪錦標</p>
<p>▲成績三小時零二分</p>
<p>不久以前，在紐約市開了一個接吻耐久比賽會，一般摩豋男女，青年情侶，參加的極爲踴躍。比賽的結果，杜六思女士，經過三小時又二分長期的努力，終於得了勝利的錦標，杜女士和伊的戀人，戀愛已經有五年的歷史，不久的將來，就要和伊的戀人結婚，所以此次的比賽，竟奪得了錦機，閉會後，有人詢問杜女士得了接吻錦標的感想，杜女士道：「向没有接吻的經騐，如今竟得到接吻的錦標，眞是意想所不及，我和他眞摯的愛情什麽地方都可表現出來，耐久的接吻，不過是眞摯的愛情一種表現罷了。」</p>
<h3 id="c256">鄕居漫筆 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 紫羔</p>
<p>（一）新生</p>
<p>機聲的節奏，炬火的渲染，和蛇樣的女人，織合着一副都市淫佚的畫。我是漠然的隨着人羣，捲進了紅色的漩渦裏。可是，精神上的刺激，在苦痛的回憶的反感中，我毅然的跑到鄕間去。</p>
<p>離開了粉紅色的都市，潛留在清靜的新龍華巳經三個月了。在那裏，呼吸着鮮澄的空氣，接觸着幽美的環境，這寗靜的，樸素的生活，緊緊的抓住了我的一顆厭惡都市的心。</p>
<p>的確，鄕間的生活是充實着青春的活力素。雖然，農村經濟是淪於崩潰的地步，可是這重陰沉的灰色，湮没不了活躍的朝氣。健美的村姑的笑靨，誠厚的老農的野談，都是詩意的情境，人生的美感啊！</p>
<p>這詩意的新生，你永久繫着我的倦疲的心靈吧！</p>
<p>（二）殘秋</p>
<p>深秋的風，吹紅了亭前的楓葉，帶來了初冬的寒意，秋是殘了！</p>
<p>天空堆着大塊大塊的雲，灰色的沉重的雲；像要壓上了人們的肩頭。田野間，枯黄的桑葉，憔悴的稻稈，滿呈着田主榨取後的萎態。没有葉的樹枝在風裏搖，殘葉掉落在秋溪裏。迷途的羔羊，在靜穆的凄凉的空氣裏，呼着親愛的媽。孤雁，歌着悲哀的調子，在尋伊最後的歸宿。</p>
<p>這殘秋的景色，映進了我的眼簾，漾進了我的耳管，我的心頭是波動着一陣不寗恬的情意，是蕭殺的情緒，悲惻的意念。</p>
<p>「秋」，傷感的季節。「殘秋」，啓示着凋零的悲哀。一切的没落的現象，都暗示「秋」的無情。一般的令人傷感。惆悵</p>
<p>深秋的風，吹紅了亭前的楓葉，帶來了初冬的寒意。秋是在傷感的心弦上消逝了。</p>

<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>江氏看到他低了頭，有一步没一步的走進了院子，手推了屋門，踏着一隻脚進來，還回轉頭來向後看，有點愛進不進的神氣。江氏道：誰在外面？柴枝道：没有誰呀。說着話，走進來，先歎了一口無聲的氣，然後在椅子上慢慢的坐下。江氏兩道眉峰，緊緊的皺着，幾乎要凑成一條線。心想剛才出去的時候，還是歡天喜地的，怎麽這一回來，又是這樣苦着臉蛋子呢？於是放出不知道的樣子，向他笑道：那料子有得富餘嗎？桂枝道：没有富餘。他側了身子坐着，微抬着頭向窗子外面的天色看着。江氏道：那王裁　對你說了什麽來着嗎？桂枝依然望着天上，並没有作聲。江氏道：我看你這樣子，有點兒不快活，是王裁縫有什麽話衝撞你來着嗎？桂枝猛然的將身子一扭道：咳！那裏這樣的囉唆？王裁縫作手藝的人，我們送買賣上門，那是看得起他，　憑什麽他要把言語來衝撞我這不呌怪話嗎？江氏原因爲他有生氣的樣子，才想問出他一兩句話來，然後好安慰他。不料竟越問越壞，他反而生氣了。本來還想繼續看將話問了下去。但提要繼續的去問時，又怕他越發的生氣，只好向姑娘笑了一笑，竟自走到裏面屋子裏去，不再問姑娘的事了。可是桂枝自己，並不因爲母親不注意他了，就解除了苦悶，他心裏想着，在這幾個月裏頭，並没有得着甘積之的信，我以爲他把我忘記了。若是據他向老媽子打聽我消息的這件事看起來，分明他還是很注意我的。我現在是有丈夫的人，而且是快要出嫁了的人，我眞不願見看他的病，引起我許多心事。（二七四）</p>

<h3 id="c260">鳥與蟲 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>在這本葉飄零的時期，所謂天堂的蘇州，鳥與蟲，又應時上市，供一般有閒階級做消遣的生涯，我把這蟲鳥生活的大槪情形，寫在下面，也算一種蘇州的風土小誌。</p>
<p>▲鳥　以鳥鳴春，鳥原是春天點綴的動恤；隔葉黄鸜，穿花紫燕，早給詩人歌唱讚美，認爲含有詩意的美妙的動物。但在這幾天上市的鳥，却並不靠着啘囀的嬌　，來博人們的欣賞，他們是靠着敏捷的飛翔，靈活的取食，當那食料，由玩鳥的人，向上抛擲的一刹那，鳥兒就奮翅飛去，憑空接食，來博玩鳥人們的喜悅；這種吃飛食的鳥兒，約有三種，寫在下面：</p>
<p>包頭：這種鳥，約有小鴉大小，全身被着淡灰色的柔羽，黄色的嘴，很是闊大，飛翔力在吃飛食的魚類中，最有勁力。包頭的食料，是生西瓜子，玩熟的鳥，能不停地飛在空中接食，經久不疲。兎起鶻落，煞是好看。</p>
<p>麻臘，他的身子的有鷄雛大小，全身的羽毛，黄黑斑爛，美麗可觀。他是吃黍子的鳥兒，飛翔力雖没有包頭耐久，可是憑空飛翔，彩羽映着晴空，很覺眩目生輝。</p>
<p>黄雀，黄雀形狀，和麻雀彷彿，不過淡黄兼着黑色的毛羽，是比麻雀美麗得多。他不但能飛翔接食，就是養在鳥籠裏面，也能啼出清脆的鳴聲，以博人們的喜悅。黄雀的食料，是藥材中的蘇子，靈活是靈活的，不過飛翔力，却比較弱小些。</p>
<p>三種鳥的價値，包頭最貴，黄雀最賤。訓練飛鳥的法兒，先將受訓練的鳥，餓着，在餓極的時候，將細繩繫在鳥的頸項裏，引誘它飛來吃食，當它近身的當兒，將食料抛向空中，它爲了肚飢，不能不奮翅飛去，開口迎食了。這樣慢慢訓練着，鳥的眼力和技巧，日漸嫺熟，訓練得百不失一，這樣習慣成了自然，解去繩索，早俯首就範，聽人玩弄了。不過這種鳥，因摧殘過分，大都不能過冬，俗語說得好，「鳥爲食死」，確是至理名言。</p>
<p>▲蟲　以蟲鳴秋的許多蟲，雖然在這草枯葉落的時候，已大半噤若寒蟬，但唧唧㘗㘗的蟋蟀，却正奮翔張牙，大顯其將軍神威。鬥蟋蟀的的在，呌「蟋蟀棚」，聽說鬥蟋蟀的輸贏，爲數頗大。鬥蟋蟀的風氣，是宋代那位太平宰相賈似道在後樂園的遣興玩意，但因宰相是時代偉人，豋高一呼，下者風從，就成了民間一種特别的賭博。聊齋誌異所記「促織」一文，就可想見宋代鬥蟋蟀的狀况一斑。</p>
<p>鬥蟋蟀的方法，也有幾項規則：第一，蟋蟀的重量，先要上厘碼秤過，須要輕重相等，然後才可開鬥。不過蟋蟀也有分量相差，那就大的方面，要情讓一些，不過道是難有的事。第二，是下法方面，那種注錢在蟋蟀塲中呌做花；從前一注花的代價，大的大洋一角左右，可是現在最普通的花，每注每半元和一元了。鬥蟋蟀的注錢，越到深冬，越是下得大，竟有三四千元一塲的。至於鬥蟋蟀的方法，先將兩方的蟋蟀，放入特備的戰柵裏，那種柵的形狀，大小和桌上鋼琴彷彿，分爲兩格，每格上面，都貫着竹托，疏疏欄着。蟋蟀到了籠裏，稍稍休息，然後由那管鬥草的人，將中間的隔片抽去，使兩方蟋蟀，互相搏鬥，那時蟋蟀因鬥草的挑撥，就不惜自相殘殺了。第一次勝負决後，那失敗的蟋蟀，分歸在休息的一格裏，用濕手巾遮在柵上，使他恢復精神，再圖第二次的搏鬥。假使第二次失敗者能夠轉敗爲勝，那麽須再休息一下，作第三次的戰鬥，以决最後的勝利，否則二次决鬥後，就判定兩方的勝負了</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>史家房龍（ＶanＬcon）解釋法國大革命，他說：「關於法國的革命，無論你讀一部小說，看一齣戲，或一本電影，使你極容易得到一種印象，以爲革命是巴黎貧民窟裏的暴徒造出來的。實在一點也不是這樣的。……一些快樂但是不小心的人們用爆竹作爲遊戲，直到他的火星落下來，穿過地板的（這塊地板，與這座建築的其餘的部分一樣巳經老朽了，）裂縫，不幸落在最下的一層，在那裏有許多年代陳舊的老廢物亂七八精的混合在一起。以後大家都大聲呌道，火着了。但是這位房主除了管理他的産業以外，什麽事都不注意，不知道怎麽樣撲滅這個火燄。火燄很快的蔓延，竟將建築的全體都燒完了，這個火燄，我們稱爲法國大革命。」這叚話，我們可用作「人心思亂」那句成語的最好註解。還有一位英國名人克斯塔費德（ＣhesterＦtield），在法國大革命前二十五年，（一七六三年）說：「凡大革命大變亂發生前的一切現象，我在歷史上看到過的，如今法國都具備了，並且日在增加。」「萬事齊備，只欠東風，」更是「人心思亂」的正面註解。</p>
<p>社會染了危症，决不是「隱瞞」，「麻醉」所能奏效的，第一要請醫生仔細診斷，處方服藥；一道靈符可以霍然病愈的幻夢早該做醒了。中國歷史上政權的毁敗，大致有兩種方式：一種是走到了盡頭的農民嘯聚起來，如野火一樣，把舊宮殿一下子燒掉；一種是外來的民族，如洪水一樣，把舊堤防完全冲毁。「人心思亂」，固然是社會的變態，仔細想來，我們能否認這個變態嗎？耐苦忍辱，如中國的農民，可謂至矣盡矣；但總得有路給他們走。倘使農民也没有路走，他們心目中以爲「眞命天子」快要出世，這就什麽都没有辦法了！而且一個民族，没有一點競存的勇氣，時時作苟安目前的打算，人心即不思亂，也有什麽辦法呢！</p>
<p>中國之混亂也久矣，應速設法消弭思亂之人心。</p>
<h3 id="c262">秘密公開 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 繩夫</p>
<p>中國最偉大的游藝場，我不知道在那裏？但有人說就是「大世界」。大世界對社會常常有貢獻的。一九三三年最最偉大的貢獻是什麽呢？據說是中秋節定造的那個不能吃的大月餅和這次的「秘密公開」了。</p>
<p>這次「公開」的「秘密」是「兩個怪人」：「一個三隻脚」，「一個有尾巴。」他們剛好就是兩兄弟，生得這樣「出奇」。大槪因爲有點非凡罷，據說一向是「嚴守秘密」的。雖然曾經轟動過山東全省，却從不肯飽故鄕人的眼福，輕露「那多餘的東西。」可是，奇人總是心地軟的，這次經了「本世界挽人再三情商」，却情無可却，只得「勉爲其難」，來飽上海公子名媛的眼福。</p>
<p>然而，這是廣告上的話。</p>
<p>廣告上還查出一雙肖像，題說：「毫無假借」，大有「眞正王麻子」的剪刀之槪。這些東西，我是不注意的，我想，即使「毫無假借」，亦不過係一種生理上的變態，一種「多餘」的病。不足欣賞。我可惜的是，「他們」的「秘密」不是兩隻大耳下埀至肩，而偏偏是一條豬尾，不能引人敬重。</p>
<p>以外，我還想到「公開」二字的意義。</p>
<p>據廣告說，這「秘密」的「公開」是被動的，我很相信。理由非常明顯：「誰願意露出自己的尾子？」其所以不得已者，爲的是錢。有錢的人，自然可以「珍藏」自己的尾子，去「公開」别人的，藉以取樂，並且，還要認這「尾巴」是奇觀呢！</p>
<p>畫家的模托兒，「公開」她的「秘密」的是畫家，在中國，作模托兒的都是窮姑娘。自然也是被動的。有錢的名媛是不肯幹這勾當的。</p>
<p>還有，强盜做了一件案子，這案子自然是一椿「秘密」。被盜的主人與强盜不得不站在兩種不同的立場。前者要「公開」這「秘密」，後者却是要死守着的。但也有爲了吃不住老爺的板子，在血肉橫飛中「公開」了這「秘密」。</p>
<p>所以「公開」「秘密」的人非是有權有勢的人不可，被公開的自然是弱者。</p>
<p>那麽，「秘密」就這般神秘麽，也不見得。自甘「公開秘密」以取得主子歡笑的，在歷史上就很多。舊戲中有「進圖」的把戲，便是漢奸公開自己國家疆土的「秘密」給敵人。這自然不是出於「情不可却」，肉刑之苦，因爲那時敵人尙未深入，兩軍勝負還未分曉中。但也非出於經濟壓迫，因爲「進圖」的人不能是小百姓，起碼也非一個大員不可，大員都是有錢的。然則，他們到底爲了什麽？我想，這也用不着我們來答覆罷！不過，我們要知道，他們公開的不是個人的秘密，並無脫下褲子，現出尾巴那般羞人。他們公開的是大衆；受苦的也是大衆。並且，這一切都是在黑暗中進行的，你也一點看不出他自己的尾巴，只聽得甜蜜的言辭，如泉的眼淚，這才眞是秘密啊！誰來「公開」這「秘密」呢？</p>
<h3 id="c263">夏里賓與高爾基 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 企影</p>
<p>前天讀了施蟄存先生的「革命時代的夏里賓」，不禁有一點小小的感想。</p>
<p>施先生似乎很替夏里賓擔憂，假如是爲了恐怕由這世界聞名的俄國歌人主演的「魔俠吉訶德」，將不爲上海的觀衆所理解，所歡迎，那倒是値得擔憂的。這部影片不是祗在南京大戲院公映了四天，而且聽說還不如繼這影片而開映的「新女性」賣座之多嗎？</p>
<p>但施先生所擔憂的，是關於夏里賓這個人，好像很容易被誤解，因爲有人在批評這個影片的時候，就說過夏里賓是曾經在俄國貴族劇院中很負盛名的這樣的話。而這句話的意思，施先生覺得，很容易暗示讀者，使他們相信夏里賓是一個侍奉貴族的歌伶。</p>
<p>夏里賓究竟是不是這樣的一個歌伶呢？施行生說不是，因爲夏里賓，用施先生的話來說，是一個「不單是爲了貴族，也不單是爲了平民」，而「應該說是爲了人類」的藝術家。</p>
<p>恰巧，我曾在一個雜誌上看到一篇也是講夏里賓的文章，題目呌做“Ｃhaliapin：Ｍask　andＭan”；而這篇文章的論旨，恰恰和施先生的相反，主要地就是暴露夏里賓這個人是怎樣一個卑鄙，貪婪，欺騙的，侍奉貴族的歌伶。</p>
<p>其實，擁着百萬的財富，和聖彼得堡的貴族與牧師一道，住在富麗的巴黎别墅裏，逍遙自在的夏里賓的現在的生活，不就是夏里賓是不是侍奉貴族的歌伶之最雄辯的說明嗎？</p>
<p>不錯，夏里賓，也和高爾基一樣，是經過了窮苦的，被壓迫的流浪生活的，他也同情過貧困的青年學生，並且在十日革命之後，還在他的祖國住了些時，在工人劇塲表演過，但這些却並不防碍夏里賓是一個　ＨisＭajestyＳolist，一個侍奉貴族的歌伶，因爲他的眞正同情是在沙皇貴族一方面，他對於沙皇，皇子，將軍，甚至劇塲監督捧給了他的最大的謟媚，他領受過沙皇所賜的金表，有一次甚至在舞台上公開地向親臨觀劇的沙皇下跪，雖然他自己祇承認跪了一個膝頭，這事還引起了他的一些朋友的僨慨，或甚至與之絕交。普列哈諾夫就爲了這事把夏里賓所贈與他的照片退還，並在上面寫着：「因爲無用，所以退還了。」就是那位比較馴順的藝術家Ｓerov也寫信給他說：「多可惜呀，連你也終竟匍匐在地下了，也應該害羞呀！」爲了要向他的朋友表示一點歉意，夏里賓曾經有一次假意地拒絕了羅曼諾夫王朝三百年紀念的盛宴的參加。</p>
<p>革命後，夏里賓之所以肯和工人們來往，甚至不惜讚英新興勢力者，也不過是爲了自已生活的保障和安全。工人們却老老實實地相信夏里賓是他們的藝術家，寗肯節衣省食，來供給這位藝術家的不能饜足的需要。但他們是受騙了。夏里賓終於想出了一個巧妙的口實，一溜烟地離開了他的祖國，永遠回到他所侍奉的貴族的懷抱中去了。</p>
<p>雖然這樣，這侍奉貴族的一代歌伶夏里賓與偉大的文學家高爾基之間郤有過一段深深的友誼。夏里賓到現在還是極口稱讚高爾基，感謝高爾基所給與他的帮助和高尙的文藝的影響。至於他們兩人最初的認識，以及他們幼年時代的交情，施先生有了簡單的介紹，我不在這裏多贅了。我祇說一說這兩個同樣出身的大藝術家怎樣走了各不相同的道路，他們的交誼怎樣呈現了不可　免的裂痕。</p>
<p>一九○五年一月九日，聖彼得堡的街上堆滿着死屍，泛濫着人血的時候，這兩個藝術家對於這次事變的反應怎樣，祇要看看夏里賓於一九三二年在巴黎出版的，「假面與人」一書裏所說的下面的話，就可了然：</p>
<p>「他（指高爾基）臉色蒼白，弄得很激昂了。</p>
<p>「他們在屠殺無辜的人們，那些惡徒！」</p>
<p>雖然我那天晚上還在一個貴族的宴會上唱歌，但我感到眞理是在高爾基這一邊。」</p>
<p>眞理是在高爾基這一邊，但這並没有使得他不在貴族的宴會上歌唱！而且也許還唱得很好呢！</p>
<p>「眞理」終於被證實了「是在高爾基這一邊」後，夏里賓郤反而跑到了外國，這可使高爾基生氣了。他曾寫過封信給夏里賓，勸他回去。關於這事，夏里賓在同書裡這樣地寫着：</p>
<p>「後來，到羅馬去的時候，阿列克賽，馬克西莫維支「高爾基的名字」又對我說，呌我必須回到我的祖國去。又一次而且更堅决地，我拒絕了，告訴他我不願意到那裏去……當我後來因爲不肯回去而採取合理的步驟的時候，這就使得我們的友誼大大地破裂了…我不願掩飾，我非常澈動地說出來，損失了高爾基，在我是頂難過，頂痛苦的。」</p>
<p>其實，夏里賓也不必難過和痛苦。高爾基的友誼對於他是早已不必要了。他早已不能從高爾基那裡獲得敎益了。…………</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑李維克著譯</p>
<p>「你不記得你那天在「珍珠」號釣船上想比我划得更有力嗎？你不記得你在她面前所說的一切取媚的話嗎？可是結果使你嫉妬得要死！後來等我得着這筆財産時，你更加發狂了，於是你憎惡我，你以種種方法表示了你的憎惡，你使得大家痛苦，你没有一時不吐出那使你窒息着的胆汁。」</p>
<p>筆爾緊握着兩個拳頭，恨不得跳在他身上，絞着他的喉嚨：</p>
<p>「啊！閉住你的鳥嘴罷，你再不要談到這宗財産上去！」</p>
<p>哲安再呌說這</p>
<p>「可是嫉妬從你的皮膚裏滲漏出來了。你和父親，母親或我所說的話，没有一句不含着嫉妬。因爲你嫉妬所以你裝作看不起我！因爲你嫉妬所以你想法子和衆人吵閙。而現在我闊了，你便再也忍耐不住了，你變成了毒物，你磨難着我們的母親，好像這事是她的過錯一樣！…………」</p>
<p>筆爾一直退到壁爐面前，嘴唇半開着，眼睛睜大着，他有着那種可以使人犯罪的狂怒。他以一種較低的，但是喘促的聲音重複說着：</p>
<p>「閉住你的烏嘴罷，閉住你的鳥嘴罷！」</p>
<p>「我好久以來就要把我所想的告訴你；你現在給了我這個機會，算你自已倒毒罷。我愛了」</p>
<p>一個女人！你知道這事，而你在我面前嘲弄她，你逼得我無路可走了；算你自已倒毒罷。但你再要這樣時，我便會敲碎你那些有毒的牙齒！我會强迫你尊重我。」</p>
<p>「尊重你，我？」</p>
<p>「對啦，尊重我！」</p>
<p>「尊重你……你……爲着你的貪慾使我們一家子名譽掃地的你？」</p>
<p>「你說什麽？再說一遍……再說一遍好嗎？……」</p>
<p>「我說没有人會接受别人的財産，假使因此要成爲别人的兒子的話。」</p>
<p>哲安呆立着不動，他不懂得他的話，他聽着這話裏有因的諷示驚惶失措了：</p>
<p>「甚麽？你說……再說一遍好嗎？」</p>
<p>「我說大家在耳語着，大家在傳播着，說你是那個把財産留給你的人的兒子。聽好啦，一個自愛的孩子他不會接受那使他母親身名狼籍的金錢。」</p>
<p>「筆爾……筆爾……筆爾……你竟想到這上面？……你……說出這番汚辱的話嗎？」</p>
<p>「對啦……我……這是我說的。你難道毫没有看出我一個月以來悲哀欲絕嗎？我晚上通晚不睡，而白天像畜牲一樣隱藏着；我痛苦，羞恥到簡直不知道自己說的什麽，做的什麽，也不知道自己會變成什麽樣子，因爲我起初還祇猜到，而現在却已明白了。」</p>
<p>「筆爾……住嘴罷……媽媽就在隔壁房裏！她會聽到我們的話……她聽到我們的話。」</p>
<p>可是他非把他的心事說個痛快不行！於是他把他的疑心，他的推測，他内心的鬥爭，他得到的把握，和那又一度失去了的肖像的故事等，什麽都說了。</p>

<p>— 新生</p>
<p>海蝘一作海脠，是産於近海的一種小魚。「鄞縣志：「鄞有小魚，味類蝦米，俗呼曰海蝘。」「北戶錄」：「恩州出鵝毛脡，用鹽藏之，其細如毛，味絕美·」這是海蝘命名的由來。但是通常都寫作「海燕」或「海鹽」，實屬錯誤。按「海燕」是一種侯鳥，（卽燕子）以生於熱地須越海而至，故名海燕，昔人時：「海燕雙棲玳瑁梁」，便是指這種燕子；「海鹽」是縣名，屬浙江錢塘道。所以把「海蝘」寫作「海燕」或「海鹽」，不但語音有别；意義更大相逕庭，絕對不能相通。我在這裏，特首爲提出，以糾正一般的膠誤。（編者按亦有作海咸）</p>
<p>海蝘大致可分爲二種：（一）「粗桂」或「中桂」，身長一寸左右（一寸以上者稱粗桂，寸裏稱中桂）有細鱗，頭部較粗；背色金黄，腹部稍帶青白；味鮮·（二）細桂，長四五分，全身作淡黄色，鱗細至不能辨，味較前者，尤爲鮮美。（「桂」字爲海蝘之代名詞，業中人多稱「桂」而不名「海蝘」。）</p>
<p>上海市塲銷行的，有日貨，也有國産。日本貨産於富士等處；國産出品地，有好幾處：寗波丨丨新化，姜山丨丨温州，烟台，威海衛等。日本貨的海蝘的最大缺點，是平淡寡味；其優點是體積較輕，頭屑較少。規模較小的商號，爲零售合算計，普通多備日本貨；但在消費者的觀點，當然以滋味爲前提，因之在商號方面，爲適應顧客需求，也不得不酌量改計，兼備國産，所以國産海蝘，在市塲上，仍能獨擅勝塲，睥睨劣貨。至於國産海蝘的等差，則以産於寗波北礵洋面的細桂（又有單頂雙頃一種雙頂較細而匀，比較最高。）最佳；其次産於黄歧·吳山·等地方的，也好；新化·姜山所産的，有細桂，也有粗桂，貨身也很好；温州海蝘，（有細粗二種）貨好價宜，最爲普通，烟台·威海衛等處所産，有日貨的優點；但同時也有日貨的缺點，這是美中不足。不過很足以替代日貨，供應需求了。</p>
<p>我國海岸線之長，勝過日本幾倍，然而有許多海産，却須仰給於日本，這是夠人深思的。實際上有很多東西，如果加以進取與提倡，無論産量或品質，都足以頡頏日貨，供應國人需求，海蝘卽其一種。記者竭誠盼望業此的商號與需用的消費者，加以深刻的警惕！</p>

<h3 id="c306">青年必讀書——春秋 <a href="#c306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>「新書推薦」這一類事，在現今的文壇上，據說頗爲時髦，並曾有人因此而大打其筆墨官司，於是引起我久藏在胸中的一部舊書，想也來湊一下熱鬧，「推薦一給現代的一般文學青年。</p>
<p>說出所要推薦的書名來，誰也不會覺得希奇，這老熟的名字。所希奇的就是在應用頗廣，而從不爲人注意的一點上。</p>
<p>那便是我們孔二先生的大手筆，丨丨「春秋」。</p>
<p>這確是一部非「生而知之」的人不能作的好書。雖說記的是二百四十二年間興亡的史蹟，裏邊實含有「中國人」的精髓。讀了不獨可以供作文之助，兼可以當做人的張本。</p>
<p>嘗論現代一般人，下筆爲文，動輙得咎。這原因，一半固爲環境關係。而另一半的原因則大都由於作者没有讀過「春秋」的緣故。</p>
<p>文章是忌直的，直則容易刺着他人的瘡疤。春秋的義法曰：「微而婉。」微的意思是不放棄自已的立塲，婉則，又須不觸忌對方。有時暗存着譏諷，有時又曲爲迴護，這實在是千古做人與做文章的秘訣。</p>
<p>故明明是在譏笑天子弔諸侯嬖妾的有失體統，而春秋上却這樣說：「天王使宰咺來歸惠公仲子之賵。」意思是寫得那麽婉。明明是諸侯召王，而春秋上却說：「天王狩於河陽。」包荒得又那麽嚴密。這都是古聖人的微言大義，而現代所流行的「縮短戰線」「業已諒解」等等名詞，大槪也就從這裏化生出來的。</p>
<p>更有一點：中國是「名敎」的國家，而「春秋」則更是名敎的敎科書。所謂一字之襃，榮於華袞；一字之貶，嚴於斧鉞，足使「亂臣賊子」聞而心懼的。</p>
<p>鄭樵春秋傳日：「大抵春秋一經書其善，則萬世之下指爲善人；書其惡，則萬世之下，指爲惡人」故二百四十二年君臣之善惡，不逃乎萬八千言之間。筆鋒可畏，使千載之下的人們聞而猶毛骨竦然。這一種筆法，現在巳有一般人學得，而且已經在試用，想出許多謚法，如「勞苦功高」，如「罪大惡極」，等等詞句來加到自已所欲加的人身上去。但在將來的千載之下，這一種筆法，是否也能像孔二的傑作「春秋」一樣的受人尊敬，使人看了毛骨竦然，現在尙不可知。總之。這也是一種不失爲可效的筆法，而爲現代文學青年所應注意的無疑。</p>
<p>其次更有一條「尊王攘夷」自吹自捧的大義，也不可不知。</p>
<p>中國旣是「名敎」的國家，故除「名」之一字，在所必爭外，其他皆可以「王道」解决之。孔子曰：「名器不可以假人」，這不獨是「聖人」一人的話，也是全體中國人的話。故周室雖衰，不可不尊，夷狄雖强，不可不抑。春秋之末賸一個支離破碎，號令不出百里的「周家老店」，却不能不硬撑頭皮尊之曰：「王室」。而於聲勢赫赫，進逼華夏的南蠻鴂古之邦的楚國，則曰「荆」，曰「楚」，曰「人」，曰「子」，以示不於同中國。雖然那時周室宗親，唐虞舊家，實實在在爲强楚所滅者不少，而我們的孔二先生却始終抱定「文字上不與發生關係」與「不承認」主義的。這政策在當時雖不能挽救各國滅亡之禍，而在現在看來是成功</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>的。楚與諸國不是現今都没有了嗎？「請看滅人者，人亦滅其國」，而楚却給孔二一「貶」，貶得至今有人讀看春秋時，還留痛恨，正義不因此而留在天地間嗎？故這一種筆法，也是可學的，至少是在國難嚴重之下，可以安慰安慰自己。</p>
<p>更有進者，胡安定曰「通　春秋，然後能權天下之事。」現今想「權天下之事」的人，又那麽多，故「推薦」這一部曾被人嘲過爲「斷　朝報」的「春秋」，又豈僅是足供作文之助，與做人之本而已也。</p>
<h3 id="c307">具有「美女魔力」的中國 <a href="#c307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>幾個月來，我們中國前有蕭伯納的「環球旅行」蒞臨斯土，參有馬萊古久列之路過與考查，最近法國小說家哥德派拉復繼蕭馬等之後到我們貴大國來觀光：這些人非爲文壇宿將，即爲有名名流與文人，足見中國目前眞可謂萬邦來朝「文星鼎照」了！</p>
<p>據報載哥德派拉於南京夫子裏得覩歌女雪艶琴便「迷着了幾天」，到北平復一度對「歷代榮華中心」的舊都愛好之後，又行脚怱怱，不辭而去的邁往日本了。可是他老先生抱獨身主義幾十年，可謂「六根清凈」，到中國便擺脫無方，走一處傾倒一處，滿懷着想和「幽默而富有東方美的中國女子結婚以安慰一生」的紅塵之夢；只因受一「浪漫女作家」的警告而未邀中國女子的青睞，便死心踏地的忘情於中國女子麽？不；他對於中國女子只恨「相見得遲分離得急」的傾慕，那能因此灰心，臨别江干時他說「中國之美麗，猶美女之魔力，若有人拒絕此魔力則一萬萬年後亦必後悔」，可見其眷眷之情，可有願生生世世與中國女子結爲夫婦之槪，而且，而且不能忘情於中國！所以哥德派拉於游歷日本之後，仍要去而後返！</p>
<p>是的，中國在在下看來，也有像美女魔力一樣的美麗，有東方巴黎的上海，有「歷代榮華中心」的古城，有穿衣服如裹在身上」的美女，而且專門供奉着等待這些游歷的外國名流來享受。不過我同我們女作家對哥德派拉所警告者一樣，他雖於部院與恊會的歡讌招待及與我國閨秀名媛相過從後，便對「東方美」「中國美麗」推崇傾心不置；事實恐對於「中國美麗」「及東方美」尙有深刻的認識。</p>
<p>中國有燦爛明麗的山河，在取之不盡，用之不竭的財富，有溫和明朗的親候，有「和平篤實」的民族，凡此一切，均爲外國「旅行家」「考審團」所歌訟贊美，但哥德派拉見不及此，只去贊賞榮華古心的古粤，即可見他對於「中國美麗」尙没有澈透了解：中國女子有「素尙禮義」的道德，有靜雅和順的溫柔，有三從四德的明敎，有嫁德不嫁容的質朴，可是哥德派拉却見着「穿衣服如同裹在身上」的摩登仕士，便以爲「美不可言」，更表示他對我國女子所特有的「束方美」幷無深刻認識。</p>
<p>不過哥德派拉是小說家，自有文學家的風度，據聞也很「幽默」，他「妄誕不經」的談話，自當以幽默解釋。他比中國有如美女，想來中所具的「美」的條件（非香艶肉感！），是受之無愧；更言「中國美麗」若「美女的魔力」，亦正象徴中國現在的誘惑性確實恨天，這一點考之實際，也正是言中要肯。同時旣已美女而又有魔力，其能使得許多男子的傾倒熱戀，當局必然之事，最近我們看到許多政治家軍事家外交家以及科學家藝術家，接踵的遠道來中國通「聘問」，而且都在與我們歡叙中，加以種種的贊譽，其爲「中國美麗」而顚倒之狀，正可槪見。不過「美女的魔力」太大了，勢必引起許可的「熱戀者」爲爭愛而决鬥，會在我們眼前論出不幸的事件來，所以我們不要在哥德派拉贊譽我們「美麗」有「魔力」時，便因此而自負自驕，正要謹防因過於「美麗有魔力」所惹出來的不幸事件！</p>
<p>同時中國雖有「美女魔力」，富有「東方美」，但是究意是歐化「摩登」盛行的現在，物質的誘惑很大，難免不走入「墮落」之途。今天可以同這一「男子」談愛，明天也可以同另一「男子」結婚，更可以利用「美女的魔力」實行浪漫主義，何妨實行靈肉的出賣呢？我勸哥德派拉早自回頭，不要太爲我們「東方美」及「美女的魔力」傾到了罷！</p>

<p>— 一琴</p>
<p>趙太爺自從家裏娶了媳婦以後，這幾天心中就有點煩悶。原因倒並不是不歡喜他這新娶來的媳婦，而是因這次喜事所引起的另一椿事情。</p>
<p>今天他又坐在賬房裏翻看他收租米的賬簿，因爲新榖早已登了場，而租米還來的可就少。</p>
<p>他揭開第一頁，就是：</p>
<p>「顧世觀戶，種田十畝，未還」他有點不高興，又順手翻下去；</p>
<p>「陳長生戶，種田四畝，還舊欠十元，新租欠。」</p>
<p>「李二觀戶，種田五畝，兩熟未付。」</p>
<p>「陸阿虎戶，種田二畝，還陳租五元，付新租五元，餘欠。」</p>
<p>「沈文生戶，種田十二畝，舊欠十五元，新租未付。」</p>
<p>「王進寳戶，種田七畝，未付」</p>
<p>「楊阿土戶，種田十五畝未付」</p>
<p>「……………欠若干」</p>
<p>「……………未付」</p>
<p>他翻看了幾頁，心中不免又煩悶起來了。他想；「過去生活多好，米糶七八元一石，每畝田租米至少也得收上六七元，一　冬裏，錢就整千整正收進來現在每畝田只收四元左右，還年年要拖欠一點，向他們收收，總是說種田人苦，今年收成不好，米價又糶不起，家中還留一點米要給老婆，娘，小孩子過活，老是聽厭了的這一類話。這批東西眞可惡，種田的苦，難道有田的人這年頭就不苦麽？你們要過活，難道田主就不要過活麽？可惡的東西，眞該統統給關起來！」趙太爺越想越冒火，就把賬簿向桌上一丢。</p>
<p>忽然無意中從那賬簿裏掉下一張「糧串」來。他又無意地拿起來看。這一下可又給他添點兒火了。</p>
<p>他唸：</p>
<p>一上下忙銀一兩五錢，帶徴自治經費二角五分，敎育經費一元，清鄕捐二角保衛捐五角，築路畝捐一元二角五分，軍事附捐一元，農民銀行基金三角，飛機捐三角五，黨部經費四角五分，米特稅九角，清丈費五角，區公所經費四角五分…………」他想「他媽的！這批狗官吏吃飽了飯，只知想出一種種新稅來，一兩五錢的正稅，　附稅附捐倒超了二十多倍，也不管人負担得下負担不下，空喊着「農村破産」「救濟農村」一類的口號，在事實上却猶以現在農村的破産還未足，儘量的加重業主的負担。往年該上一二百畝田的人家，總可稱爲小康之家了，除了一年中的開支外，到年底總得有一千八百的贏餘，現在呢，勢非借債不能過日了。但開口向人借債，又碍於顔面，而一切開支，又急切省不下來。就如這次爲兒子的婚事，又花去一萬多元，媳婦又是舊家，一切往來禮節，又少不得照舊排塲，雖然博得外面人說我趙家還不差，那知我却夠費心思了。又如二兒子等，爲門楣關係，又不能不讀書，年年得繳上一千八百的學費。唉，這情形眞不比往年好過，看來是還要更壞下去。…………</p>
<p>他頽然地倒在椅于裏，再不能想下去了。</p>
<h3 id="c309">賭咒 <a href="#c309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>賭咒，無疑地是一種「國粹」。論語上就載着我們的孔老夫子有一次去見衛靈公的夫人南子，丨一個淫名很著的女人丨引起那「不得其死」的高足子路的不悅。於是我們的老夫子就着了慌，尤恐他的高足心直口快，說出什麽不好聽的話頭來，就賭咒說：「予所否者，天厭之！天厭之！」以證明他的去見南子，並不是懷着什麽壞念頭。經此一說，子路自然也未便深究，於是一場師徒失和的喜劇，就此過去。寥寥十個字，能使出名「好勇鬭狠」的人，聞而也軟下心腸來，也可見賭咒兩字魔力的一斑了。</p>
<p>自是而後，歷代相傳，奉爲「處世藝術」之一。不論達官上任，或鄰婦失雞，凡是内有所愧，外有所疑的時候，都得借重這二字。</p>
<p>但名稱或稍有不同。譬如「達官式」丨或可簡爲「官式」丨的賭咒，巳不曰賭咒，而曰「宣誓」。宣誓的時候，照例必正其衣冠，肅其容貌，面對總理遺像，單舉右手，而讀印就的誓詞。詞曰：「余謹以至誠…如或違反誓詞，甘受最嚴厲的處罰……」云云。據說，這也是一　法令，而爲做官者所必具的手續，意思是呌他以後倘做差了事，不好下白。但在我們的記憶中，似乎每一個官吏，發覺他已經有「如違……」以下的　格，凖備向他兌現時，大都已邀游海外，或遠走他方。以致這個「最處厲的處罰」，多因「地址不明」而「無法投遞」過。這類疑案，大槪不少，等到日子些時，於是又可以當新貨出賣了。</p>
<p>故說穿了，鄕婦賭咒，不過替城隍廟裏幾尊泥菩薩多點幾付香燭，而達官貴人的宣誓，也只是凑凑當日的熱鬧而已！否則，豈不冷清清也哉！</p>
<p>凡此種種，合義是一樣的。前面所說多在於辯明是非，如你說我偷雞，我說不偷，倘你再不相信，我就得賭咒了，「偷了你的雞，便什麽樣，什麽樣的」。有「神明」做保證，於是你也相信了。而現在所說的，則多屬於希望將來，意思是說：「爲什麽不……」凡是這些詞句，初看似乎是極慷慨沉痛而又滿有把握的；但仔細一想，却又覺得用一手指着天邊的太陽，一手揮着淚，說「命該如此尙復何言」或是牙齒打着戰而說「不出幾年，他們國内自會怎樣，怎樣」的樣子，也不容易使人樂觀的。反之却畫出一幅没落的圖形來了。</p>

<h3 id="c310">老温頭上的白疤 <a href="#c310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>——五塊錢買隻壓髮帽——</p>
<p>老溫生平有一椿遺恨，那就是不知是那一年了，總之是還剛剛能走路的孩提時代，頭蓋上生過一個毒　，足足潰爛上三個月，才慢慢的收口結皮。但從此就不再生髮毛，成了那麽一個酒盅大的白疤。</p>
<p>十一歲的那一年，老溫到鎭上去考高小，是初秋，天還那麽熱，這時他已有些感覺那白疤的欠體面，就提早把冬季的小瓜皮帽戴上頭皮，還預蓄好一腦長頭髮，聽說鎭上有西式理髮店，滿心準備去理一個「朝後梳」的西式頭，想必可把白疤掩護得住了。他走到半路上，秋老虎猛射着他的瓜皮帽，頭髮裏就冒烟流水，他才把瓜皮帽鬆一鬆，過路的生人很少，自然無須顧慮。</p>
<p>進鎭了，他的兩眼不停的瞟着兩旁的商號，從街頭直到巷尾，竟没有一爿豎牌的理髮店，有的只是些背短扳凳的伙計立在街邊給人家剃光頭。他感到非常失望。</p>
<p>因爲這樣，他在鎭上求學的幾年，除了熱不可當的頂中暑天，實實没法戴帽，只得「隨它去也吧」外，四季唯一的辦法與唯一的安慰，就靠一頂瓜皮帽。好在小鎭上戴黑緞瓜皮帽，也還算很時髦，不然他果眞更要煩惱了。</p>
<p>好了，他畢竟有一天到了繁華無比，只要有錢連神像都有活的買的上海。</p>
<p>這時候，他的年歲大了，「愛美」的心，「怕羞」的心，恰恰與年歲對比的增長，討厭頭蓋上的白疤，自然更要强烈起來，而且他早就知道，上海的學堂裏全都有妖裏妖怪的女學生，所以他入校之日，第一着，就走到校對門的美容理髮館，理了一個「朝後梳」的西式頭，理髮匠給他塗上厚厚的一層司達康，梳了又梳，他偏着頭，翻着眼，看看鏡面，果然白疤不見了，他感到無上的安慰，以致掛牌原是「男士理髮小洋兩毫」，他竟那樣使個大方，順手就掏給理髮匠「四角八開」，理髮匠笑嬉嬉的，恭而敬之的送他出店，送他到馬路上。</p>
<p>平日老溫全没有這麽神氣，他一路回到校裏，就一路不停的吹着唿哨，簡直喜得發了瘋狂似的。當晚睡得貼貼服服，第二天醒來，就順毛摸着面鏡子，一照之下，竟又發現一個白疤，他知道這是没有塗過司達康，没有梳過的必然現象。可是他還不知道塗在頭髮上的是呌什麽東西啦，暗暗的問着另外一個同學後，他就火速的跑到一爿洋貨店裏買了一瓶轉來，接着就厚厚的塗敷一層，當心的拿着梳子梳了又梳，却總是掩不滅那怪討厭的白疤，自己的手法到底不</p>
<p>於是老溫又同樣感到　小瓜皮帽時代的煩惱，可設是較　　甚。上課去，只是偷偷的坐在最後一排，生怕被女同學　見了，那是多害羞的事啦。</p>
<p>時候又恰恰是初秋，規規矩矩的　起帽來，無疑的是更會給人取笑。</p>
<p>老溫苦着了，左思右想，找不出適當的辦法，後來還是一位和藹的老同學貢獻他一個意見，說是到四馬路一帶閙布的街邊去化兩毛小洋買隻壓髮帽，那眞是最好的辦法，在宿舍裏無妨經常的戴着它，上課時戴了去亦復無妨，即欲那麽考究禮貌，先用壓髮帽一壓，然後再塗司達康，再梳，白疤凖可掩住了。</p>
<p>老溫深以爲然。</p>
<p>就去買，帽價講定是兩毛，他就　張五元鈔給那小販，小販找不出，拿去兌，却說是一張假票，拉拉扯扯的吵了半天，還是老溫吃個虧，收了假票，再給小販「兩角八開」。</p>
<p>老溫轉來，喪氣的對同學們說：</p>
<p>「倒霉，眞倒霉，五塊錢買隻壓髮帽！」</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（三十七）兩個不說話的人</p>
<p>過後表姊就走了，敏姊送她去了一個多鐘頭。歸來獨自在臥室裏整理衣服另件，像一個馬上要出遠門的人一樣。我從公園内散步了一會，走過那條新舖黄沙的曲徑，心中更是不自然，回到社中，弟弟告訴我姐姐要出門了。我趕到三層樓上，敏姊埋着頭在收拾瑣碎的物件，思我踏進來，她舉起雙手做出攔阻的模樣說：</p>
<p>「别進來，别進來，我正在找尋一件重要的東西。」</p>
<p>「馨弟說你要出門？」我眞的站住了脚。</p>
<p>「聽小孩子的話」。敏姊仰起頭來打個哈欠，像很乏力似的笑着說。</p>
<p>「倒底遺失了什麽重要的東西，滿屋子的搜尋，你說出來，我帮你找」。</p>
<p>我跨進門去，靠壁衣架上吊着的衣服都不見了，窗前寫字臺上的另件也收拾乾凈，無論如何這情形和搜尋物件是不和合的。敏姊還是灣着腰在床底下搬出一疊的皮鞋盒子，把破的隨手往門外抛去。</p>
<p>「敏姊」我不料變故來的突如其速，雙手將她扶了起來「敏姊，請你告訴我，弟弟没有做錯事啊！」</p>
<p>「誰說你做錯了事？」她說了句忙的回過頭去，依稀她的眼眶中已滿聚了清淚。</p>
<p>我閉上了門，扶她坐到床上，自己拉過一隻椅子坐了。</p>
<p>「姐姐，没有抱歉的話，你這樣告訴過我，你不能使你的弟弟内心永遠感到抱歉。姐姐，說出來，姐姐」。</p>
<p>敏姊低着頭，玩弄手中一角破碎的盒子板。</p>
<p>「姐姐，我們一同從故鄕逃出來，如今到這樣的結束是你願意的嗎，你要走，我不能强求你，但你總得說出一個緣故來……」</p>
<p>「敏姊舉起含淚的目光，從袋中將一張㩛皺的信紙授給我正是表姊退回我的信不知什麽時候遺失的。</p>
<p>「敏姊，寫這封信的時候，你也同意了的，今天慧姊退回我，我隨手塞在衣袋裏的，遺失了也没有什係關係」。</p>
<p>「哼，瞞了我到徐家匯去，也是我同意的？」</p>
<p>「姐姐，我明白了，並不是慧姊約我出的，舅父有事和我商量，送來的信我丢在下面字紙簏内，你問阿福知道的。」</p>
<p>「看過了這封信再說話！」</p>
<p>我懷疑的將紙團展開來，是我自己的字跡，不過在署名底下多了兩行鉛筆字，仔細一認。</p>
<p>「弟弟，我接受你一切的勸告，我重開始再做一個人，以我們小時俟的情愛，你總能原諒我的。今天我以你的來與否，卜我們的結果！」</p>
<p>敏姊怒目，望着我，我的罪惡是被判决定了。無論我聲明，這兩行鉛筆字是不能恕我的。</p>
<p>沿街的一株楊樹，被風吹着探頭窺着，室内是沉默着，兩個不說話的人。</p>

<h3 id="c313">金城影戲院主人訪問記 <a href="#c313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— 雲巖</p>
<p>大家儘管喊着電影事業不景氣，但是新的影戲院，仍舊在接連接二的産生出來，現在北京大戲院對面的角子上，又造了一座高大的房子。房子的骨格，已經快完成，看上去倒好似很宏偉的。在大門前的高空中，一塊白底黑字的金城大戲院告白，現露在我的眼前。「哦！金城大戲院，原來就在這裏啊！」我這樣心裏自忖着，再瞧那金城大戲院幾個大字的下面，還載着許多小字，方才知道他們的辦事處，就在對面，心想時候還早，不如去找他們裏面的辦事人員談談，也許對於這座將要開幕的影戲院，得着一些新的消息。</p>
<p>說去就去，一會兒就踏進了他們的辦事室，由一位身材瘦小而精神煥發的青年出來招待着。原來他就是戲院主人柳中亮先生，我也就把我的姓名和來意告訴他，我們就在一張長的沙發上坐下開談起來了。</p>
<p>我先問柳先生，金城大戲院是不是公司性質；有没有外國人的根本；資本大約多少。柳先生告訴我他們的公司，是他和他的兄弟中浩二人，拿出資本來建築的，此外並無外股，更談不到外國人的股本了。致於資本一層，他們預算是五十萬。</p>
<p>我一聽兄弟二人，拿出這許多錢來建設電影院，眞不能不佩服他們的胆量和魄力；因爲上海的電影院，大都是公司性質的。我正欲接問下去，忽見中浩先生，手裏拿了一大倦座套材料花綢和絲絨等類走了過來。中亮先生又給我介紹了。他因爲要到裏面去接洽别的事情，就請中浩先生倍我談談。</p>
<p>「令昆仲對於影戲很有經騐嗎？」我這樣接下去問。</p>
<p>中浩先生含笑回答我說：「我們在南京創辦了一座世界大戲院，現在已經四年了，總算還不錯，去年又在世界左近，買了一塊地皮，想再建築一座規模較大的國泰大戲院，後來因爲看見上海的大電影院，有許多都是外國人的資本辦創的。利權外溢，實在令人寒心。因此和家兄發了宏願，要在上海創一座大衆化的戲院。現在的金城，就是我們計劃的實現。」</p>
<p>「那未貴院的座位有多少？將來的座價怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>柳先生回答說：「座位是一千八百。致於座價一層·現在還没有確定，總之我們志在宣傳電影文化，普及大衆娛樂。雖然戲院造得凭般貴族化，而座價是無論如何不會貴族化的。」</p>
<p>「貴院將來是映國産片，還是外國片呢？」</p>
<p>「這件事情，現在尙未到發表的時期，恕我不能奉告，不過無論中片也好外片也好，我們對於於選片是注張非常嚴格的。」</p>
<p>我們又談到發音機的重要。金先生聽見了，就很興奮的說：「發音機我們雖然試騐了好幾家，但是還没有决定，大槪預備採用Ｒ·Ｃ·Ａ·一九三三年最新式的巨型機吧。不但這個，我們爲謀觀衆舒適起見，還裝設了最新式的冷氣機和熟氣機哩。」</p>
<p>說到這裏，裏面有人請他聽電話，我就興辭而出了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c314">評「虎鮫」ＴigerＳhark <a href="#c314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>爲了適合觀衆的需要，影片必需刺戟而且輕鬆，這在目前的美國影片中，可以看出有着如此傾向，而且將必然的流行起來。</p>
<p>就拿這第一國家公司出品的「虎鮫」來說罷，裏面除了必有的愛情之外，還有人與鯊魚格鬥的刺戟，有詼諧對白的輕鬆。所謂刺戟輕鬆，兼顧並用。</p>
<p>這是以海洋爲背景的，海濱漁人的生活，捕魚的方法，海洋的風光，純撲的變愛；一切異樣的風俗人情，生動而可愛的呈顯在我們眼前，不由的引起我們無限的讚嘆。雖然這並不是實攝影片，可是加以故事的配合而插入充分的地方色彩，究竟是本片最大的特色。本片的價値也就在此。</p>
<p>關於主人公馬克個性的描寫、我們得相信作者確很成功。忠誠，率直，勇敢，不過是幾個單純的文學上的形容詞，而在電影上表現出來，就必須使我們在畫面上感覺的認識。這是一種十分繁難的工作。劇作者使他在友愛上充分地發揮出可愛的個性。他爲朋友犧牲，他拯救貧窮的孤女。然而他雖然需要異性的熟情，但女人們不會愛他，只有例外的將恩報德的少女，才甘心勉强的和他結合。當然，這種結合對於熱情的少年是容易動搖的，好像年齡過於懸殊的夫妻一樣，當她遇着活潑而力壯的丈夫的友人之後，便很快的動搖了對於丈夫的信心。就這一方面說，我們决不能加她以何等的罪名。同時情如手足的馬克的友人，在愛情與友誼的矛盾的心情中生活着，也使人們對他發生同感。而主人公一時因妒而懲罰好友，也並不是過份的行爲。大家都是奸人，大家都有着矛盾的心情而苦悶着。如此，劇作者對於這種衝突和矛盾，能夠有如此完美的描寫，的確是非常的成功。同　導演很精細而經濟的描寫愛情，而對於生活的素描亦很强調，便是他很大的成功了。當然小的不夠或方法的錯誤，在所難免，譬如寫那女人過於不夠，便是缺點。加之他對於音響效果，也很注意，如月夜單調的琴聲，情人擁抱時的槍聲，馬克臨終時的鐘聲，都是全不誇張而與劇情非常唿合。雖然這些都是陳舊的方法。</p>
<p>主角愛德華魯濱孫，在「惡覇」或「兩秒鐘」之後，有了這「虎鮫」，眞使我們相信他演藝的高强。固然在個性上一貫的是强硬，大胆，而與「惡覇」却有大的善惡之分，與「兩秒鐘」頗爲相似。單就他的表演來說，已經很値得稱讚了。李却亞倫無特别成就，女主角更是淺薄。攝影是十分成功的。</p>
<h3 id="c315">「天然世界」 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>ＳtarkＮature</p>
<p>人類的觀念形態，是極複雜的。所以「人猿泰山」之類，一方面是新奇刺激的滿足，一方面是現實的逃避，和原始生活的追求。因此舊的需影批評者，對於這點還要作種種粉飾的辯解，而像這張「天然世界」，却是連辯解的餘地也没有的影片了。</p>
<p>開展在觀衆的面前，是菲洲的風景；介紹給觀衆認識的，是愚蠢而馴伏的土人。幷且在這裏，我們更看到菲洲豐富的産物，以及無盡藏的金銀鑛産，這裏有力的暗示着「到菲間去」丨卽使菲洲的土地，已經瓜分盡了，而這未經壓榨的一羣，至少還有很多脂血可得。二十世紀的侵略，不是不一定要佔領土地的嗎？</p>
<p>幷且他不但正面的寫出這些就夠了，他更爲侵略者，找出物質和精神上的根據，那就是，白人對於其它一切人種的優越感。換一句話：就是所謂，白色人種的文明的使命。這點他在書面上，是儘量的運用襯把對比的方法寫出，他們的用意，不但說是侵略菲洲是帮助土人進步，同時開發鑛産，也是「惡貨之棄於地焉」。菲洲是白人的菲洲，我們聽　這句話幷不是一年了。優勝劣敗，天演公理，赫希黎先生的哲學，是有着布爾舊亞的黨派性的。「哲學是黨派的科學　，而藝術的黨派性」的人們，在這裏，遇到了鐵一般的回答！</p>
<p>不但在内容方面，「天然世界」是徹頭徹尾的宣傳影片，就是形式方面也完全同樣的。普通蠻荒片不過介紹主人的經過罷了。至多，說到主人的開始回國，而這張一天然世界却是回國以後的口述，我們卽就這一點，已經知道作者的本意是在宣傳了。</p>
<p>至於技術方面，首先我們得知道這張「天然世界一可以說是新聞片，風景片，原因是中間没有故事。因此對於編劇，是講不到的。但剪接却有很好的地方。因爲是舞客的口述近以他隨處的讓觀衆明瞭這一點。方法是有「提示」，而這「提示」，是和整個的展開不隔謨。好樣土人跳舞，接着的一百勞會跳舞，不但是有些地方相像，而拿來對比，同時舞客口述時觸景生情，見這種「百勞會舞」，而想到和他相像的土人跳舞。或則說副土人跳舞而要，聽者具體的知道這個舞姿，而指出相像的「百勞會」跳舞做例了，是極聰明的。</p>
<h3 id="c316">天一新訊 <a href="#c316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— 犀</p>
<p>▲一個女星　「一個女明星」開拍還在夏天，到現在將近半年了，雖然完工大吉，但是剪接還需時日，這部影片，是以電影公司做背景，上自總理，下至小工，一一顯現銀幕之上，拍有聲影片的攝影場情形，也在銀幕上介紹出來，好多人想參觀電影公司的攝影工作，每苦不得其門而人，現在「一個女明星」中可以很清楚的看到，該片名爲「一個女明星」，實際上全體男女明星，都參加在内，所以「一個女明星」中的明星，比任何一張片子多，這樣說起來，這片名倒有些名不符實。</p>
<p>▲二年計劃　這二年計劃，並不像蘇俄的「五年計劃」，要經過二年以後才得完成，這二「年」是二部新片的片名，一部是「熱血青年」，一部是「似水流年」，是新從明星轉入天一的湯傑和高梨痕分任導演，「熱血青年」是王元龍葉秋心主演，「似水流年」是胡珊葉秋心主演，一部是愛國劇，一部是倫理劇，劇旨都非常好，這兩部片子，從開拍到現在，已有兩個多月，現在都已攝竣，這二年計劃總算宣告完成了。</p>
<p>▲三齣平劇　邵醉翁導演，陳玉梅主演，的「吉地」，現已送京檢查，不久卽可開映，該片雖然以農村爲背景，但是其中有不少富麗的大場面，單是許鴻業娶香姑的堂會一場，髻影衣香，觥籌交錯，已是非常熱閙，三齣平劇，尤見精采，第一齣是張文綺小姐的「覇王别姬」，第二齣是樊小姐的「懷都關」，第三齣是張振鐸（飾許鴻業）葉秋心（飾許妾）的「梅龍鎭」，兩人正在台上唱得起勁，忽然傭人來報老太爺死了，於是許鴻業不及卸裝，摘去鬍鬚，怱怱跑下台去，一時秩序大亂，賀客變成弔客了，</p>
<p>▲四面秋心　一九三三年新發現的影國風人葉秋心，她的美麗，簡直可以做一切美麗的模範，足稱得一聲「模範美人」，她最近突然被擢爲四部影片的主角，而且和她聯合主演的人，都是銀壇上第一流巨星，像「青春之火」的陳玉梅，「似水流年」的胡珊，「熱血青年」的王元龍，「一個女明星」的胡珊，陸麗霞等，像這殽平地一聲雷，秋心也大可自豪了，有詩爲讚：「秋心更比春心艶，四面玲瓏映巨星」。</p>
<p>▲五路進軍　學校有什麽三三制，現在天一的攝片，可說是五五制，已攝成未公映的有：「吉地」「青春之火」「熱血青年」「一個女明星」「似水流年」五部，預備開攝的也有部，一部是陳玉梅主演的「歡喜寃家」，一部是王次龍陸麗霞主演的「舞宮春夢」，一部是薛覺先唐雪卿主演的「根不相逢未嫁時」，一部是王元龍主演的「林冲」還有一部是張恨水原著，嚴獨鶴編劇的「太平花」，女主角由陳玉梅擔任，其餘人選，還没有决定，似這般五路進軍，定然玩一個五花八門，五光十色，比諸葛武侯的八陣圖還好看哩。</p>

<p>Liu Guitang's Troops Prepare to Move West</p>
<p>Chahar Province's Mixed Troops Complete Reorganization</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: The Japanese troops invading eastern Chahar are a regiment of the Eighth Division, attached with more than 2,000 puppet troops. The main force is still entrenched in the vicinity of Xifengkou and poses a threat to invade Chicheng. However, there have been no active actions in the past two days. Liu Guitang's troops are preparing to move west, and the defense of Chicheng will be transferred to the provincial army. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: Zhang Renjie arrived in Zhang from the Buleizhuang defense post on the evening of the 20th and visited Song at noon on the 21st to report that there were no changes at the front. The Japanese and puppet troops have not yet implemented a retreat. Zhao Dengyu came to the province from Zhangbei at noon on the 21st to visit Song to report that Zhangbei was peaceful and will return to defense in the next few days. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: Zhang Wu, the director of the Zhangjiakou Post Office, arrived in Zhang and visited Song on the 21st, deciding to take office on the morning of the 22nd. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song issued 5,000 yuan in supplies to Liu Guitang's troops, which were collected by Sun Guanying on the 21st. He will order the troops to move to Yangyuan. Tian Gangyi and Sun Guanying plan to return to Chicheng on the 22nd to report to Liu. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: Song Zheyuan received a telegram from Liu Guitang stating that Japanese troops in Xifengkou drove more than ten armored vehicles and carried dozens of machine guns on the morning of the 19th, heading from the Daggezhen Avenue in Chicheng to Sunjiaying, camping in the village and summoning the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the village to conveniently reconnoiter bandit activities. In the afternoon of the 19th, more than 100 cavalrymen from Zhang HaiPeng's troops arrived to reconnoiter the area north of the village, with a tendency to spy on Longmensuo. Song ordered Liu to be on high alert. The Huang Song Central Detachment, which retreated into Longmensuo, opened to Dushikou on the 19th. Song decided to send a special envoy to inspect eastern Chahar. Zhang Yunrong, the commander of the Zhangbei Garrison, will return to Zhangbei today. Song ordered Zhao Yudeng to be responsible for the defense of the Guyuan, Baochang, and Kangbao areas. Zhang Shusheng stayed in Zhangjiakou due to illness. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan stated that the incident in eastern Chahar has been calmed down and nothing has happened. The Japanese and puppet troops went west this time, and it was heard that it was a mutiny by a part of Li Shouxin's puppet troops stationed in Duolun, and a team was dispatched to pursue them, which suddenly entered Chahar territory. On the 13th, there was a conflict with Huang Shouzhong's troops stationed in Xinyuan. Regarding the reorganization of the mixed troops in Chahar Province, I personally went to Zhangbei Jiabusi and other places to handle it and it is generally completed. When speaking to the various troops, I often said that my reorganization method has three points: (1) assistance, (2) perfunctoriness, (3) resolution, which must be determined according to the actions of each unit. The reorganization of Tang's troops has been completed, with a total of 8,000 people, organized into six regiments, and transferred to Zhangjiakou City for barehanded training. The reorganization of Huang Shouzhong's troops has also been completed, and all the bandits who were incorporated have been dismissed. After Tang was transferred from Chicheng to Zhangbei, the local area was quiet. 200,000 yuan of relief funds for Chahar Province have been remitted and the Civil Affairs Department is convening representatives from various counties to discuss distribution and relief methods. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in eastern Chahar is still tense. After receiving the report on the 20th, the Chahar Provincial Government ordered the troops in eastern Chahar to be on high alert and planned to redeploy the defenses. Guyuan is still defended by Zhang Yunrong, and Liu Guitang's troops in Chicheng will be temporarily transferred to [ ] and another powerful unit will be dispatched to take over. Song will personally inspect eastern Chahar. During the interval, the Japanese and puppet troops' western invasion was under the false name of suppressing bandits, but in fact they were waiting for an opportunity and had ulterior motives. At the beginning of the Xifengkou battle, it was reported that the Japanese army was invading Chahar in three routes: the northern route attacking Guyuan from Duolun, the middle route spying on Dushikou from Daggezhen, and the southern route attacking Chicheng from Heihe. Liu Guitang's troops stationed in Chicheng once moved the headquarters to Yangtianbao, southeast of the county, until the battle ended, and still led the troops into the city to garrison.

<p>Hainan Tibetan Army Withdraws to First Generation Base</p>
<p>There is No Problem with the Panchen Lama Returning to Tibet</p>
<p>National Government Officially Awards Dalai Lama a Title</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xining telegram: After the death of the Dalai Lama, the Hainan Tibetan Army suddenly withdrew to the first-generation base, guarding Lhasa. It is rumored that there will be major changes in Tibet. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the passing of the Dalai Lama, there is no problem with the Panchen Lama returning to Tibet. This is because the three major monasteries in Tibet expressed their welcome this summer. This time, after the passing of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan regime will be temporarily maintained by the Silong Kasha. After the young Dalai Lama is selected in accordance with Tibetan customs in the future, the regime will be transferred. The Panchen Lama will come to Beijing via Nanjing after the New Year to ask the Central Government for instructions on everything before he can set out for Tibet. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Erbu Kun, Deputy Director of the Tibetan Office in Beijing, left Beijing this morning for Nanjing. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission presented a request to the National Government to posthumously award the Dalai Lama with the title of "Protector of the Nation, Promoter of Dharma, Benefactor of All, Enlightened and Perfect Master" for maintaining the Dharma and protecting the country and the people during his lifetime. It convened the directors, councilors, and secretaries of various departments on the morning of the 21st to discuss preferential treatment measures. It has been decided that the Tibetan Affairs Office will be responsible for drafting a proposal to be submitted to this week's Mongolian Affairs Council Standing Committee for approval and then to be recommended to the Central Government for verification and approval. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, all section chiefs of the Mongolian Affairs Council went to the Tibetan Office in Beijing to pay their respects, accompanied by Gongjue Zhongni. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Panchen Lama's Office in Beijing stated that the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet has long been a matter of course. He had expressed his great welcome before the death of the Dalai Lama. Now that the Dalai Lama has passed away, the religious and political affairs of Tibet cannot be without a person in charge. Therefore, the return of the Panchen Lama is the most urgent circle at present. As for all the facilities and policies after returning to Tibet, it should be handled in accordance with the Central Government's intentions. The Panchen Lama is currently lecturing on sutras in the Inner Mongolia Yikezhao League, and President Wang has repeatedly telegraphed him to come to Beijing. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 21st stating that the Dalai Lama of Tibet, who taught kindness and extensive awareness, clarified his nature, protected the country and the people, and made outstanding achievements, had hoped to live a long life, stabilize the border, and expound the Dharma. It is now heard that he has passed away, and the shock and sorrow are profound. The Dalai Lama should be posthumously awarded the title of "Protector of the Nation, Promoter of Dharma, Universal Benefactor, Enlightened and Perfect Master." All commendation ceremonies should be extremely sincere. The Executive Yuan should order the relevant departments to jointly discuss and submit a proposal for implementation, in order to demonstrate the Party and the country's utmost intention to cherish the distant and commend the worthy. This is the order. (21st Central Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the death of the Dalai Lama, Wang intended to draft a condolence telegram and give it to Gongjue Zhongni to translate into Tibetan and forward it to the Lhasa Silong Gacheng. Shi Qingyang also telegraphed Lhasa on the afternoon of the 21st to express his condolences, saying that he was shocked and saddened to hear of the death of the Dalai Lama, and he felt great concern for the Western frontier. In addition to requesting the Central Government to give generous posthumous awards and ordering the Mongolian Qingkang Pingre Wutai temples to chant sutras, he sent a special telegram to express his condolences. The government plans to commend the Dalai Lama, and will discuss the commendation measures at the Executive Yuan meeting next week. In addition to sending personnel to represent the Central Government to pay their respects nearby, the government will also posthumously award titles and allocate funeral expenses. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Tibetan Office in Beijing stated that after the passing of the Dalai Lama, all political and educational facilities in Tibet are the responsibility of the Silong. The situation in Tibet is normal and unchanged. The Kang and Tibetan armies are still holding each other on both sides of the Jinsha River. When the Dalai Lama was dying, he issued a will to stop military action. After receiving the news of the Dalai Lama's death, the Central Government also telegraphed the Sichuan and Kang armies not to take advantage of the mourning to attack. Reports say that the Dalai Lama was poisoned to death, but the Tibetan telegrams received here did not mention it, or it was a misunderstanding. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Shi Qingyang, sent a telegram of condolence on the 21st after the Dalai Lama passed away in Lhasa on the 17th. The original text is as follows: "The Lhasa Silong Gasha Yicang and all Tibetan monks and people are all aware. I was shocked and saddened to hear of the death of the Dalai Lama, and I felt great concern for the Western frontier. In addition to requesting the Central Government to give generous posthumous awards and ordering the Mongolian Youth Re Wutai temples to chant sutras, I sent a special telegram to express my condolences.

<h3 id="e24">The Shift in Japanese-Soviet Relations and the Intensification of the World Economic Panic <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— England</p>
<p>The political situation in the Far East has tended towards sharp opposition since the United States formally announced its recognition of the Soviet Union on the 16th of last month. In the current stage, the fundamental problem lies in the active implementation of Japan's mainland policy. We observe that the recent grand theories of the Japanese not only have great ambitions to rule Asia, but also hold the ambition to dominate the world. However, to dominate the world, one must first dominate Asia, and to dominate Asia, one must first blockade the Soviet Union. Therefore, the completion of the Manchurian rule is the most noteworthy, and the shift in Japanese-Soviet relations is especially not to be ignored.</p>
<p>Looking back at Japan's actions to exclude the Soviet Union's northern Manchurian forces, we have long known that the negotiations on the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway are a delaying tactic on both sides. Therefore, from the beginning, it planned to establish a ring railway to surround the Chinese Eastern Railway. Then, it arrested Soviet railway staff to destroy the railway administration system. Recently, it appointed another director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, who is above the Russian director, Ludi, to interfere in the railway management rights. Japan's intention to exclude the Soviet Union is no longer a pose of concealment, but rather a reverse view of the Soviet Union's attitude, which has also become tough, no longer as gentle as before. Looking at the extremely severe warning issued by the Soviet Union to Japan and the puppet regime on the 17th of this month, it pointed out that the continued exclusion of Russia by Japan and the puppet regime is a deliberately implemented policy, in order to reduce the importance of the Chinese Eastern Railway and eliminate the Soviet Union's rights on the Chinese Eastern Railway property. It is to completely occupy the railway as the ultimate goal. The Soviet Union's stern tone has been in sharp contrast with Japan's increasing pressure. At this time, is there still room for composure?</p>
<p>However, at this time of extreme world panic, the Soviet Union's production plan is still trying to complete the work of the second five years. Even if Japan is eager to try and decide to compare with force, if the Soviet Union is not in a mature military preparation, or the German-French relationship is on the verge of rupture, or there is some development in the Japanese political situation, then its authorities will not suddenly fight with all their strength because of the dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway. Moreover, the value of the Chinese Eastern Railway, whether military or economic, has long been like a turtle in a jar. Furthermore, from the Japanese perspective, although it has been vigorously repairing the navy and army for three years, and is striving with the British and American powers for colonies, and even forcibly occupying Manchuria and exerting its power to the fullest, it has ultimately failed to alleviate Japan's domestic overproduction, making the situation in the Far East even more tense. Moreover, the British and American countries see Japan's efforts to carry out colonization and feel threatened by Japan's economic power, and they have long been wary. Therefore, at this time, even if Japan wants to take advantage of the Soviet Union, it is not necessarily without scruples. Therefore, it is clear that Japan still wants to use winding methods to achieve its goal of ruling Asia. The future of Japanese-Soviet relations can also be imagined.</p>
<h3 id="e25">### Yin Tong's Attitude is Passive <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Arrived in Ping Last Night and Intends to Resign</p>
<p>The Issue of Through Train Service Between Ping and Shen is Temporarily Shelved</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong returned to Tianjin at 5:30 PM on the 21st. He will go to Ping in the next few days to visit Huang Fu to report on his experience in Beijing. Yin told reporters that he went to Beijing to visit Minister Gu to report on the business situation of the Beijing-Liaoning Railway and asked for instructions on the rectification policy. The issue of through train service between Ping and Shen has been drafted by this bureau and submitted to the ministry for verification, but it has not been submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval. The matter will be shelved for the time being. The establishment of customs at the various passes of the Great Wall and the postal service have not been heard of any progress in Beijing, and it is difficult to realize at this time. The Luan River Railway Bridge has been in disrepair for a long time and urgently needs to be rebuilt. The engineering office has been ordered to design it, and construction will begin as soon as funds are raised. Although the route of this railway has been shortened, there is still a surplus of more than one million yuan this year. The year-end employee bonuses are expected to be issued in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong is scheduled to arrive in Ping tonight to visit Huang and report on his trip south. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong will come to Ping tonight or tomorrow morning. It is heard that he will visit Huang to resign. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong came to Ping from Tianjin at 8:00 PM on the 21st and is scheduled to visit Huang Fu on the morning of the 22nd to report on his trip south.

Whether or not he will resign must wait until after visiting Huang. It is heard that Huang still wants him to serve. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>And Negotiates Postal Transport Contract Methods</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Peiquan, the organizer of the Southwest Five Provinces Civilian Aviation's opening of five air routes including Guangzhou to Longzhou, came to Beijing for the second time on the 21st. He immediately went to the Ministry of Communications to meet with Wei Yifu, Director of the Postal Department, to negotiate filing procedures and to establish a postal transport contract. Liu said that the Southwest Five Provinces Civilian Aviation Company has a capital of two million yuan and plans to open five air routes: 1. Guangzhou to Longzhou; 2. Nanning to Guiyang; 3. Guiyang to Kunming; 4. Guangzhou to Qiongzhou and Beihai; 5. Guangzhou to Fujian. It is planned to purchase ten aircraft for use. The company has recently received the required capital, and has been established in Guangzhou. It has ordered two aircraft from the American Stenlin Aircraft Factory. These aircraft passed Shanghai a few days ago en route to Hong Kong, and will be installed within the week. They will then fly to Guangzhou for test flights on the Guangzhou-Longzhou route. Formal service is expected to begin in January of next year. The route is 520 kilometers long. During the trial operation, it has been decided that the itinerary will initially be a one-way flight, with the aircraft flying from Guangzhou one day and returning from Longzhou the next day. Flight stations have been set up in Wuzhou and Nanning to carry passengers and mail. Airport radio and other facilities have been completed. A temporary airport has also been opened in Guiping for emergency use. After the route is successfully operated, more aircraft will be purchased to operate the Nanning-Guiyang route, and then the Kunming, Guangzhou, and Qiongzhou routes. As for the Guangzhou-Fujian route, it will be discontinued because the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong route already passes through the area. The purpose of this trip to Beijing is to negotiate filing procedures with the Ministry of Communications and to establish a postal transport contract. After these matters are completed in three or four days, he will return to Shanghai and then to Guangzhou to prepare for the opening of service. (Special telegram of the 31st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government recently appointed Chiang Kai-shek and Kong Xiangxi as Standing Committee Members of the National Economic Council according to the revised organizational regulations. It is learned that Kong took office on the 20th. (Central News Agency telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi told a Central News Agency reporter on the morning of the 21st that the plan for reorganizing land taxes is currently under discussion with his subordinates. There are many types of surcharges on land taxes in various provinces, and the tax burden is too heavy, causing great suffering to farmers. Therefore, the first step in reorganizing land taxes is to alleviate the suffering of farmers and strictly reduce various surtaxes. The central government will find ways to compensate local governments for losses incurred due to the reduction of surtaxes. Customs duties and salt taxes are also being reorganized, and the principle is to seek fairness. For example, the revenue from sugar tax has decreased after a slight increase in the tax rate, and this urgently needs to be reorganized. In short, all taxes, whether increased or decreased, should be based on the premise of not harming the people's vitality. (Central News Agency telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong issued a sudden order on the 21st, strictly ordering his subordinates to work diligently for the public good and prohibiting tax collection agencies and collectors from overcharging or embezzling funds. (Central News Agency telegram of the 21st)</p>

<p>France and Germany Massively Arming, Extreme Anxiety</p>
<p>Frequent Diplomatic Contacts Among Countries, Resembling Pre-War Conditions</p>
<p>(London) After participating in a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons, British Foreign Secretary Simon is scheduled to depart for Paris tomorrow afternoon. He and his wife will stay at the British Embassy in Paris until Saturday. British Prime Minister MacDonald said in the House of Commons today that during the parliamentary recess, British cabinet members did not want to formally tour Europe for disarmament matters. Foreign Secretary Simon will now be traveling to Italy for a Christmas holiday in Pichi. When passing through the capitals of various countries, he may have the opportunity to meet with cabinet members of those countries. It is learned that both Britain and France believe that without resuming the Geneva disarmament conference, there will be no perfect plan. France fears that Britain will make concessions to Germany, so it advocates that those who support the League of Nations should immediately reach a draft disarmament treaty and make Germany responsible for making a choice, so that everyone can see Germany's attitude. According to French sources, Germany has reorganized its domestic war debts. The army has been reorganized, and the national defense force has a total of 265,000 people. In addition, there are 80,000 police officers who have received military training. Military officers are not included in this number. France has an army of 428,000 men, of which 172,000 are volunteers. Furthermore, France's military service period has been shortened to one year, resulting in a reduction in troop strength and a weakening of its war power. France is now planning to befriend Russia, but the majority opinion in Paris is that European peace depends on Britain's clear announcement of its policies. (Reuters telegram of the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e31">Simon's European Mission <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>To Ascertain the Final Opinions of France, Germany, and Italy</p>
<p>Preliminary Negotiations Will Only Involve Mediation</p>
<p>Declaration to be Issued Today Before Departing for France</p>
<p>(London) The cabinet held its weekly routine meeting, and almost all of the meeting time was devoted to discussing Foreign Secretary Simon's upcoming trip to continental Europe. Regarding this matter, the cabinet adopted an important decision on procedure, namely that Simon would first go to the House of Commons to make a declaration tomorrow morning, and depart for France at 1:45 PM, staying at the British Embassy in Paris. He will then go to Geneva on Saturday, and from there directly to Capri, Italy, to rest. He will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini approximately when he departs to return to the country. At that time, British Ambassador to Germany Phipps will be able to report to him the results of the ambassador's upcoming negotiations with the German Foreign Minister. Simon will then compare Phipps' report with the opinions expressed to him by Peng Gu. In this way, the opinions of both France and Germany can be conveyed to Mussolini simultaneously, and Simon can be sure of the policies Italy will adopt regarding disarmament and the League of Nations. This is the main purpose of Simon's trip to Europe. The general impression is that the cabinet meeting reaffirmed its trust in Simon, allowing him to conduct diplomatic negotiations and bring the preliminary negotiation period to an end. During this preliminary negotiation period, Britain is only engaging in mediation. Simon will return to England on January 7 next year. From this perspective, it can be seen that the British cabinet will ultimately decide what attitude to take only after Simon returns home and reports. That time will be in mid-January next year, when the Disarmament Conference reconvenes. This afternoon, Simon met with French Ambassador to Britain Corbin for a long time. (Havas)</p>

<p>Branches Established Worldwide</p>
<p>Over Fifty People Have Been Detained</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the arrest of 18 spies here, it has been learned that a large espionage organization of a certain country has been discovered. Among the 18 people arrested are two Russian-American couples and the daughter of a former politician from Paris. It is reported that two Russians who lead the organization have escaped. A large amount of money, a radio engine, and various reactionary documents were seized during the arrest. Documents from various countries are prepared, including Chinese. It is reported that some of them are related to maritime and air defense and commercial espionage. The US State Department has cabled the US Ambassador in Paris to provide accurate information. It is reported that the nationalities of those arrested are extremely mixed, including Italians, Czechs, and Norwegians. The first people arrested were a Polish medical student couple. This large-scale arrest occurred at the same time as the government announced that it would allocate large sums of money to expand defenses along the border to the coastline. Authorities have been investigating this organization for several years, and it has only been cracked down on today. In recent years, French authorities have paid particular attention to espionage activities along the border, as espionage incidents occur frequently. Their greatest goal is to probe the truth about French border forts. After the arrested individuals were uncovered by detectives, they were detained in various detention centers. Those who entered American citizenship were a travel agent from Orange, New York, named Swidge. Two other Englishmen are also suspected of conspiracy, as is a merchant born in Romania named Baykovitz, whose wife, Knoruk, was also arrested. (Reuters telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Police are actively investigating the recent espionage case. Today, they arrested another ten suspects, including a Romanian naturalized in Canada, named Begovitz, who is the leader of the spies. Begovitz and his accomplices were about to escape when the police arrived. Police seized various documents and a complete set of secret radio transceivers in their residence. Their actions are likely related to the Soviet government. (Havas telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to reports, the authorities have discovered an espionage organization and have detained over fifty people to date. The organization has branches throughout Europe or the world. Among those detained is a translator from the Naval Ministry. According to the Petit Parisien, police have seized many documents and a secret radio transmitter in connection with the case. French police officers have flown to Warsaw to investigate events related to the case. Another newspaper reported that the US government has ordered the US Ambassador to France to report the details, as it is said that there is an American couple among those detained. (National Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US State Department expressed surprise after receiving news that two American citizens in Paris had been arrested on charges of privately possessing French military documents and photographs. The State Department's files show that both had obtained proper passports. It is expected that the US Ambassador to France will be instructed to investigate the matter.

As a result, France's long-standing shortage of kerosene can be remedied by the Soviet Union, while Soviet Russia, which has traditionally purchased aircraft from France and Italy, can manufacture them domestically. Therefore, the economic cooperation between France and Russia is highly valued. (Dentsu telegram of the 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Avenol Indicates League of Nations Weaknesses Should be Reformed <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Basic Principles Need Not be Disturbed</p>
<p>Working Methods Can Be Improved</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting at which League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol reported on how the League of Nations' weaknesses were being criticized. He paid particular attention to (1) the equality of rights of all countries in the League of Nations, (2) the revision of peace treaties, and (3) the link between the League of Nations Covenant and the Treaty of Versailles. Avenol believed that the weaknesses of the League of Nations could be reformed based on the criticisms, without disturbing the basic principles of the League of Nations, because these principles should ultimately be maintained. He believed that the root of the League of Nations' problems lay in its poor working methods. If working methods could be improved, then the criticisms would naturally cease. Avenol concluded that the League of Nations was still needed by the international community and should therefore be allowed to exist. After Avenol spoke, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Herriot presented a report on the exchange of views between France and Germany. The committee then expressed the hope that the government would make a clear announcement on the situation of the Franco-German talks and the measures it intended to take before the Chamber of Deputies adjourned. Deputy Flaubert said that it was dangerous for France and Germany to directly negotiate a non-aggression treaty, because the Geneva Declaration of December 11, 1932, did not disregard French security by allowing Germany equality in armaments. Moreover, the four countries of France, Germany, England, and Italy had solemnly declared that the borders of Germany with France and Belgium had been guaranteed by England and Italy. All countries should maintain the status quo on this matter and not raise issues. With these two points in mind, it was inappropriate for France and Germany to conclude another non-aggression treaty. (Note: The two points referred to by Flaubert are, first, the declaration jointly issued by the five countries of England, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy when Germany was allowed to participate in the Disarmament Conference last December, and second, the Locarno Treaty).

<p>More Opportunities for Naval Academy Graduates</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the White House spokesman said that the merger of the US Coast Guard and the Navy will likely be realized soon, but the exact date may not be announced until after the new year. Currently, officials from the Coast Guard, the Navy, and the Treasury Department are consulting with the President on the merger plan. It is reported that the US President advocates that the Coast Guard form its own team within the Navy, managed in the same way as the Marine Corps, in the hope of increasing efficiency and saving money. It is rumored that under the current plan, officers within the Coast Guard will be assigned from Naval Academy graduates, and the Coast Guard Academy in New London will be converted into a graduate research institute for Naval Academy graduates, with the aim of further study and saving expenses. In recent years, almost half of Naval Academy graduates have switched to civilian positions, and in the future there will be more opportunities for them.

<p>Returned to Chamber of Deputies for Second Reading</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Senate passed the entire financial bill with 266 votes against 51 votes. The bill has now been returned to the Chamber of Deputies for a second reading. It seems that the passage of the bill by both houses is no longer a problem. Today, the Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the issue of Germany's disarmament proposals and recommended that the government determine its policies before Congress adjourns. (Reuters telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Senate continued to discuss the financial bill in the afternoon, during which the clause on taxing agricultural interest aroused a lengthy debate. The result was that it was removed by a majority of 193 votes to 98 votes. The clauses were then passed item by item, and a modification was made to the clause extending the period for granting import licenses, arguing that the order on taxing such licenses should be approved by Congress immediately, rather than applying the deadline for requesting approval set for tariff matters. The reason for this was to indicate that the license tax was a taxation measure, not a tariff issue. This clause was then passed in accordance with the amended text. Budget Minister Marchandeau said that this measure was particularly applicable to new products that could compete with domestic products and could generate unemployment in mining areas. At that point, the Senate passed the entire financial reorganization bill by a majority of 206 votes to 57 votes. Finally, Financial Committee Rapporteur Reynaud said that the Chamber of Deputies' original bill stipulated that the national treasury's income would be 4,788,000,000 francs, while the Senate Financial Committee increased it to 4,938,000,000 francs, and what the Senate passed was only 4,632,000,000 francs, of which (1) saving government expenses accounted for 1,702,000,000 francs, (2) extraordinary income accounted for 1,223,000,000 francs, (3) 500,000,000 francs could be obtained from monitoring tax revenues, and (4) 1,207,000,000 francs could be obtained from reorganizing tax sources. Reynaud concluded that it was still necessary to save government expenses. (Havas telegram of the 20th)</p>

(Havas dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Rome: The Middle East and Far East Academy held its opening ceremony at the Pantheon today. Students from Egypt, India, China, and Japan who came to Rome from various European countries to attend the Asian Students Conference all participated in the ceremony. The original proposer of the Middle East and Far East Academy was Mr. Dusi, a member of the Italian Central Research Institute. Dusi had previously led an Italian scientific expedition to Tibet and Nepal. Later, Mahatma Gandhi visited Rome and supported the idea, leading to the decision to establish the Middle East and Far East Academy. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was very concerned about this matter and ordered the establishment of the academy on February 16 of this year. Its purpose is to promote cultural relations between Italy and the countries of Central, South, and East Asia and to study the economic issues related to these countries. The former Minister of Education, Santi, serves as the president of the academy. Dusi serves as the vice president in charge of cultural research. Count Volpi, a cabinet member, serves as the vice president in charge of economic research. Baron Liciaretti and Congressman Tessari serve as consultants to the executive department. The above five key figures are selected by the Prime Minister. In addition, thirteen consultants are selected from various enterprises and academies that have common interests with the Far East Academy. They are appointed by the King of Italy upon the Prime Minister's recommendation. The importance of the academy is evident from this. The founders plan to provide scholarships to Asian students studying in Italy so that they can introduce Italian businesses, especially Italian insurance companies, in Eastern countries in the future. In addition, the academy plans to launch a large-scale magazine and organize an Indian art exhibition in the near future. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)</p>

<p>Government Representative Says Do Not Be Too Pessimistic</p>
<p>Labour Party Motion Amended and Passed</p>
<p>(London) Today, the House of Commons debated the position of the cotton industry. Labour Party members moved a motion criticizing competitive capitalism and advocating the reorganization of the cotton industry under public ownership to implement a comprehensive cotton industry cooperation policy. Conservative Party member Antrobus stated that the colonial market has been reduced by Japanese competition and that a large part of the trade with China has been lost and cannot be recovered. Liberal Party member Payden responded on behalf of the government, saying that there is no need to be too pessimistic about the cotton industry, that Britain's production costs are higher than those of its competitors and should be reduced, and that the British government has been paying close attention to Japanese competition. The House of Commons should not constantly bring it up, as this will not help Lancashire and will not help the relationship between the British and Japanese governments. "We do not have any magic to immediately change the position of the cotton industry. Lancashire can only work hard to innovate and adapt to the times to help itself." Antrobus proposed amending the Labour Party's motion, stating only that the cotton industry intends to improve its organization and that the House of Commons welcomes any methods proposed by the cotton industry that can achieve this goal. This amendment was passed by 135 votes to 30. The debate was thus postponed indefinitely. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)</p>

<p>Substantive Action Will Be Taken After Congress Convenes</p>
<p>(New York) U.S. Speaker of the House Rayburn and Senator Thomas spoke at an economic club here today, both stating that the President and Congress are against the indiscriminate issuance of banknotes and the inflation of currency, but advocate improving the position of silver. They also said that the President will be able to obtain congressional support to continue reducing the gold dollar to only be worth fifty cents. Thomas, as the leader of the inflation faction in Congress, firmly asserted today that inflation is absolutely inevitable. He believes that substantive action will be taken after Congress convenes on the third of next month, because it is estimated that government spending for the coming year, including relief programs, will total 6 billion yuan, while revenue may only be 3 billion yuan. If the shortfall of half is not made up by reducing the value of the gold dollar, then the government will have to admit bankruptcy. Moreover, the slower the reorganization of the currency system, the lower the value of the gold dollar will be, and the greater the crisis of real inflation will be. Speaker Rayburn expressed agreement with the government's plan and the President's views, saying that we cannot maintain a fixed exchange rate between gold and silver, but we can allow gold and silver to circulate as currency at the same time, without fixing their exchange rate. Rayburn's words show that he does not support setting a fixed exchange rate between gold and silver. It is widely believed here that the U.S. government will also support this view.

<h3 id="e82">Astronomical Research Institute Observes Lunar Occultation of Venus and Saturn <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The phenomenon of Venus and Saturn being successively occulted by the moon, that is, successively disappearing behind the moon, is quite rare. Astronomers are paying close attention to this phenomenon. The locations where this phenomenon can be observed are primarily in eastern Asia, with Japan being the most convenient. This is because when the phenomenon occurs there, the sun is already near the horizon, making it easier to observe. In our country, the sun is too high in the sky, making observation inconvenient. On that day, staff from the Astronomical Research Institute went to the Zijin Mountain Astronomical Observatory, intending to use the largest reflecting telescope in the Far East to observe this phenomenon. The time Venus disappeared was around 6:21 PM, but due to circuit issues with the equipment, they were unable to observe it. They only saw it reappear around 3:46 PM, appearing slightly below the east-central part of the moon. The crescent moon had a point of light on its eastern edge, visible even to the naked eye, which was Venus. It then gradually moved away, appearing below the moon. At this time, Venus was half dark and half bright, resembling the two phases of the moon, with a luminosity of negative four and an apparent radius of seventeen seconds. Subsequently, they continued to observe the occultation of Saturn. Due to incomplete telescope installation, they only used the attached three-inch telescope for observation. At this time, Saturn's luminosity was only zero point one nine, and its apparent radius was only seven seconds. Furthermore, the sun was still shining brightly in the sky, making it difficult to find. Later, assistant Li Jiancheng saw an elliptical glimmer emerging from the northwest end of the moon's dark edge, disappearing completely at 4:55:37 PM. This elliptical glimmer was Saturn's rings. Afterwards, due to a temporary malfunction in the equipment's circuits, they were unable to observe its reappearance, so they went down the mountain. They observed near the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum with small binoculars, estimating its reappearance to be around 5:36 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Public Telegram <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Telegram from Qingdao to All Newspapers: In recent years, the nation has suffered many misfortunes, and all industries are in decline. Fishermen along the coast have suffered particularly severely, either harassed by bandits or invaded by foreign fishing vessels. Along the thousands of miles of coastline across the country, there is almost no fishing industry to speak of, and the fishermen within these thousands of miles have almost no livelihood to pursue. Our Ministry of Industry, bearing this responsibility, is striving to revive the industry. It has established fisheries management bureaus in coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Shandong, aiming to devise ways to protect fishermen and improve the fishing industry. The laws are well-intentioned and the intentions are good, which is not only a blessing for the fishermen, but also a fortune for the country. We merchants, living by the sea for generations and making a living by fishing, are especially pleased to see this happen. Therefore, upon the arrival of Xu Songpu, the director of the Hebei-Shandong Fisheries Management Bureau, in Qingdao, we immediately met with him and contributed our knowledge to facilitate his work. Xu initially cited the country's difficulties and the Ministry's empty coffers, and then, in the name of the Management Bureau, borrowed money from us to cover operating expenses. Considering the good policies and eagerness to achieve results, we merchants quickly gathered more than 30,000 yuan in cash and lent it to the Fisheries Management Bureau, with Director Xu issuing an official receipt, promising to pay interest at 8 percent per month, and to repay the principal and interest in full by the Ministry of Industry within six months. Our merchants acted righteously, with no other motives mixed into the loan issue, and we did not dare to harbor any mistrust towards this specially established central agency. Who knew that after six months, not a single penny was returned? Director Xu falsely claimed to be going to Beijing and never came back. The Ministry of Industry, under the pretense of this, dismissed Director Xu and appointed Wang Qikun, the section chief of the bureau, as acting director, and then issued a clear order to shut down the office and instructed Acting Director Wang to go to Beijing to finalize the closure. They did not inquire about the debt owed to us merchants. When we merchants submitted a petition to the Ministry requesting payment, the Ministry of Industry claimed that the loan from the Fisheries Bureau had not been reported and that they could not verify and issue it. They instructed us to submit the petition directly to the Bureau. When we merchants followed the order to negotiate with Acting Director Wang, Acting Director Wang pushed the matter away, claiming that it had already been reported to the Ministry. It seems that the Ministry and Bureau are shifting blame and colluding in a scam. Finally, when we merchants telegraphed the Ministry for instructions, they simply ignored us, which is unfathomable to us common people. It was not easy for us poor fishermen from the coast to pool our resources. Once we encounter such an accident, we will be displaced. In addition to still appealing to the Ministry of Industry to return the money, we implore our wise and enlightened officials of the Party and the State, and the enlightened people of the country, to understand our heartfelt feelings and grant us assistance, so that our money can be returned to its original owners and we can safely fish. We are infinitely grateful. Signed, Zhu Yingfu et al., thirty-two coastal fishermen merchants, creditors of the Hebei-Shandong Maritime Fisheries Management Bureau.</p>

<p>Western Route Army Stationed in the Upper Reaches of the Gan River</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the Fujian Incident occurred, the Guangdong troops suppressing bandits in southern Jiangxi have been withdrawn to guard the northeast of the two rivers. The defense areas north of Ganzhou and west of the Gan River, including Chongyi and Youzhen, have been handed over to the Hunan troops. However, the Nanchang Headquarters did not receive a report when Liangfu Shadi Youzhen and other places were evacuated. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Nanan on the 15th to inquire about the details from Yu Hanmou. At the same time, he ordered a certain unit of the Western Route Army to quickly move in. However, during this troop replacement, local communists took the opportunity to become active. For example, small groups in various places in Yudu changed the flags and numbers of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, extensively proclaiming that there were a lot of salt and kerosene being transported to the red zone for supply, and claiming to attack a certain place or city. Therefore, people could not help but panic. Recently, the Provincial Party Headquarters received news from Ganzhou that, due to the Fujian Incident, the people of Ganzhou were speculating about the movement of the Guangdong troops, resulting in many rumors in the market. In order to stabilize people's hearts, Yu Hanmou, commander of the First Army, telegraphed Li Zhenqiu, commander of the First Division, to instruct Commissioner Zhang to inform the people not to panic each other. The army will set up a city defense command when necessary to maintain law and order. Ganzhou was attacked and destroyed by Peng Dehuai in 1931. After the arduous repairs of the fortifications and various works by the garrison troops, it is quite strong. Now, the Li Division believes that defense is important and has decided to set up a city defense commander to focus on defense. (December 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Guangdong and Guangxi Jointly Suppress Border Bandits <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Mobilizes Garrison Brigade to Increase Defense in the West River</p>
<p>Guangxi Cangwu County Bans All Boats</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Huang San Zha bandit gang on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi is gathering in Jinkeng and other places in the Dongping District of Bobai County, Guangxi Province. The area is adjacent to Hepu County in Guangdong Province, so the bandits often appear in Hepu. The defense forces of the two Guangdongs have repeatedly sent teams to encircle and suppress them, but they have not been able to eliminate the bandits. At the beginning of the month, Luo Ying, the garrison of Hepu, joined the people of the Republic of China and crossed the border into Guangxi to encircle the bandits in Jinkeng. At that time, the people of Dongping District of Guangxi Province also organized a team to assist in the suppression. As a result, many bandits were annihilated in Mazizhang. Four bandits were captured and eight heads of cattle were recovered. During this battle, the Guangdong and Guangxi militias encircled and suppressed the bandits for three days and nights. Several officers and soldiers were injured. The remaining bandits fled into the Longtan Mountains in Dongping. In order to prevent the remaining bandits from resurfacing and consolidate the winter defense, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities recently urgently needed to dispatch troops to trấn in the West River basin. Guangdong Province recently telegraphed the entire garrison brigade stationed in Qiongya to the West River. The advance troops of the first regiment of the brigade, led by Huang Guoliang, arrived in the province from Haikou on the Hai Diao warship on the 9th of this month. They gathered in Huangpu on the 11th. The next day, the second battalion of the Huang Regiment, led by Mo Fuyi, arrived in Sanshui County in the West River. The remaining first and third battalions departed from Haikou on the 14th and will successively go to Sanshui and Southwest to defend. Two years ago, the garrison brigade was transferred to Qiong. It consisted of three regiments. The second regiment, led by Liu Binggang, had been transferred to the province and stationed at Jiangcun Station in Fucheng. The third regiment, led by Peng Zhifang, will depart from Haikou after Huang Guoliang completes the transport. The first regiment will be stationed in Fengchuan Deqing and the upper reaches of the West River, one regiment will be stationed in Zhaoqing, and one regiment will remain in Sanshui County. The original Independent Fourth Regiment, led by Wang Dinghua, will be transferred from the West River to Haikou to take over the defense of Qiongya. The second battalion of the Wang Regiment, led by He Zhongfan, arrived in Haikou on the 8th, and the first battalion also arrived in Qiongya on the 12th. The third battalion will be transferred to Qinxian to defend. It is expected that they will complete the handover by the end of the month. Guangdong Province has increased the garrison of a guard brigade in the West River. In addition to a part of the army being sent to Rongwei, Teng County, and other places to handle pacification, Guangxi Province has also designated Wuzhou as a water transportation hub. Recently, winter defense has been carried out. Therefore, Cangwu County promulgated temporary measures to ban boats to prevent villains from hiding. The main points of the boat ban measures include: all boats in Anping, Rongcheng, and Xiande Districts in Wuzhou County shall be investigated, numbered, and registered according to the household survey method. The time for boats to depart is set at 6:00 AM every day, and the time for temporary stops is set at 7:00 PM. The district chiefs of each district will convene a meeting to designate a location for boats to gather and anchor, and they are not allowed to anchor freely. Boats are not allowed to travel at night to transport goods or people, to prevent stowaways. If there is a legitimate special emergency and they need to travel at night, they must obtain a special travel permit. If there are other boats from other towns and ports that come to stay, the rural kapitans of the boat owners in that garrison must report to the local public office or village head for verification and examination.

<h3 id="e102">Inspection Record of Jiawang Mining Area <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Sunken Area is Approximately Over Two Qing</p>
<p>Compensation for Damaged Farmland is Expected</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The sunken farmland near the Jiawang mining area and the dispute between the people and the mine have lasted for many days. The rumors from all sides are inconsistent. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter took the Jinpu No. 8 train to Liuquan at 7:00 AM on the 19th, and then took the Jialiu small train to Jiawang. He immediately went to the sunken farmland to conduct on-site inspections, visited farmers' representatives in Daquan Village, visited the mining authorities of the Jiawang Mine, and visited the coal mine. He took the Jinpu No. 7 train back to Xu at 7:00 PM in the evening. The eyewitness investigation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Inspection of the Sunken Land: He boarded the train north at about 7:00 AM and arrived at Liuquan in about an hour. Liuquan market is located northeast of the station and belongs to the second district of Tongshan. There are hundreds of households in the market, including the district office, Liuquan Elementary School, and the county-run Agricultural Education Center. The market is still developing. The Jialiu small railway runs east between the market and the station. The track is very narrow. He boarded the small train and went east, passing through the Chaifang and Qingshanquan stations to reach Jiawang. This type of train is dedicated to transporting coal. The coal is produced in Jiawang and transported to Liuquan, and then transferred to various places for sale via the Jinpu Railway. The train runs back and forth five or six times a day. The nearby people can ride the coal trucks at will, which is quite convenient. After getting off the train, he walked northeast from the Jiawang Mine and conducted an on-site inspection in the open field. The sunken land can be found everywhere from Xinqiao in the northeast to Daquan in the southwest. Some of them are evenly sunken, forming a low-lying shape, while others suddenly fall, forming a ground cave. There are also graves that have fallen down. However, according to the trend, the sinking should have occurred in the summer and autumn. Today, except for a few ground caves near Liulin, the rest are planted with two crops of wheat, leaving only the high and low shapes. The Liulin ground cave is about a few feet deep, and in the fourth section of the land south of the mine, there are newly discovered cracks, dozens of them vertically and horizontally. These cracks are about two inches wide and form a curved arc, which is a sign of sinking. Further south, in the land in Xiaohuizi, there are also graves and monuments sinking down. However, the coal-mining layer is several feet below the ground, and it is impossible to sink suddenly to form a precipice. Therefore, they all show a continuous sinking shape, and the tightness of the geology is different, and the degree of emptiness is also different. It is impossible to sink in the same way. Therefore, it is difficult to sink or not sink in the same area, and it presents an uneven state.</p>
<p>▲Talking with Farmers: In the sunken area, they met several farmers and guided them to visit Liu Haiqiu, the village chief of Daquan, and rural leaders Ding Peifan, He Qisheng, Zhu Maogui, and Zhao Xuecheng. According to them, the farmland in the fifth village of the ninth district of Daquan, which belongs to Tengyi, Shandong, has been sinking since this summer, and is still sinking. At that time, the farmers gathered and negotiated with the mine. In September, Cui Gongfu, the magistrate of Teng County, sent a committee member, Liu Qinfang, to come here to assist the mine manager of the mine, Jiang Shanshou, the director of the general affairs office, Sun Fangkai, the engineer Xu En, and the chief of the ninth district, Wang Zhuxi, and representatives of the local village chiefs to stipulate that each acre of sunken land would be compensated with four yuan to compensate for one year's harvest. This compensation would be stored in the Huadong Company for one year, and one year's worth of compensation would be paid. If the grave was sunken, it would be compensated with fifty yuan for relocation. After the joint measurement, about two qing of land in this village were sunken, and about 200 graves were sunken. There were also losses from the southwest to Xiaohuizi Dagouya, but the land belonged to Dagou Village in the second district of Tongshan, so the village could not understand. Among the households in the village that were affected by the disaster were Zhu Maomin, Liu Yupei, Wang Chaogang, Liu Yuxiu, Guo Guangsheng, Lu Shengji, Liu Yulan, Wang Tinggen, Guo Chuansheng, Guo Fengyue, Guo Fengming, Sun the lame, Wang the bald, and Guo the mute, about a hundred households. In addition to the sunken land, the Jialiu Road blocked water and flooded farmland, about 200 steps wide from east to west. At that time, it was also agreed that each acre would be compensated at a price of three and a half yuan. The mine also has new wells that have been excavated but not yet mined, and it is draining water to the outside, flowing southwest to Xiaohuizi, damaging farmland. After negotiation, the mine is responsible for managing the river. The negotiations have been resolved so far, but because the continued measurement has not been cleared, the payment has not been paid. On that day, the farmers there were holding a meeting in the village office to discuss the collection of money.</p>
<p>▲Mine Visit: He then left Daquan and went to the Jiawang Mine to visit the mine manager, Jiang Shanshou. Jiang had gone to Shanghai two days ago, and was received by Sun Fangkai, the director of the general affairs office. According to him, the Jiawang Company was mined in the Qing Dynasty and managed by Yuan Shikai. In 1928, it was handled by Yuanji. In 1930, it was taken over by Huadong Company. Jiawang contributed 800,000 yuan in old products as shares, and Huadong contributed 800,000 yuan in shares, totaling 1.6 million yuan. Wells No. 1, 2, and 3 were opened by Jiawang, and Wells No. 4, 5, 6, and 7 were opened by Yuanji. The company is opening new wells, which have not yet been completed. The forecast is that it will take another year to complete the new wells. At this time, the only way to save the situation is to limit the amount of coal produced on one hand and shorten the completion of the new wells on the other. Currently, Wells No. 4, 5, 6, and 7 produce about 400 to 500 tons of coal per day. The workers are paid on a contract basis, divided into large and small workers. Large workers are paid 50 to 60 cents a day, and small workers are paid 30 to 40 cents a day. They are all poor people working nearby, or farmers doing it in the slack season. As for the negotiations on the sunken land and flooding, the farmers insist that the coal mines in the stratum where the land was not purchased when mining is the reason. According to the Mining Law, mining land only needs to be approved by the official department and notified to the landowner before it can be used. If there is damage, they are only responsible for compensation. Therefore, there is a compensation method that was agreed upon a month ago. It is also an unavoidable fact that water is discharged from the mine. Although the company is responsible for managing the river, it still needs to apply to the official department for approval. Currently, the mining areas that the company has obtained are Jiawang, Dagouyan, Zhuangzhuang, Xiaqiao, Shishanzi, Chaocheng, and Qingshanquan. The company will continue to handle them. However, in recent years, transportation has been slow and sales have been weak. Development and prosperity still depend on the assistance of the government and all parties.</p>
<p>▲Coal Mine Visit: Later, Tan Huanda, a mining engineer, led the inspection of Wells No. 6 and 7. The well is located less than one from the southeast of the main mine. When they arrived at the well, the workers on the well were extracting coal from the well. A steel beam was suspended high above the wellhead, tied with a giant rope. Four ropes struck an iron plate. There were also many small iron cars. The iron plate carried the car down the well, filled with coal, and hoisted it up. Then, a turning machine was used to push the coal into a coal car and transport it to the mine. Tan said that the well is about 12 zhang deep and has a layer of coal. However, the coal here is mixed with stone, which is the so-called coal stone. After mining, the stone and coal are mixed together, with few debris, which is inconvenient to pick. Therefore, the firepower of the coal here is lower, but the price is also lower. It is hoped that the coal in the new wells will be rich in coal seams, so that the company can develop. The workers in the well work eight hours a day. After leaving the well, there is a bathhouse for washing. The excavation site in the well is framed with wooden beams in the shape of a well to prevent the collapse of the stratum. The collapse marks seen outside may be due to the rotting of the abandoned well beams, resulting in a partial collapse, which cannot be collapsed immediately. It was already around 4 o'clock. The reporter did not have time to enter the well, so he took the small train back to Liu and took the Jinpu train back to Xu. (December 20th)</p>

<p>Wang Zhu-ming, a 24-year-old teacher at Shanghai Quanzhang Middle School from Jiangning, joined the China Territorial Security League, a communist organization, in May of this year. Later, he participated in two meetings at the Zhongshe Western Restaurant on Weihaiwei Road in Shanghai and No. 27 Hengchang Lane on Beile Road in the French Concession, and served as an editor at the meetings. His writings were mostly published in the China Tribune, advocating communism. In July, a secret agent from the Central Party Department stationed in Shanghai reported to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. He was arrested and sent to the Suzhou High Court. After investigation by the prosecutor, he was prosecuted under Articles 6 and 10 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China. Yesterday (the 21st), Hu Shantong, the presiding judge of the Third Criminal Court, opened the trial. Considering that the defendant was a young student who had gone astray, the circumstances were examined and found to be worthy of leniency. A lighter sentence should be imposed to show compassion. Therefore, the verdict was written as follows: The defendant, with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, organized a group and was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, ordered to be sent to the Reformatory for reflection.</p>

<p>The house of Zhang Yao-xi, a farmer in Anning Township, the sixteenth district of Wu County, was suddenly attacked by more than a dozen robbers the night before. They knocked on the back door, and Zhang Yao-xi woke up in his dream and immediately called his wife, children, daughters-in-law, etc., to use hoe handles to prop up the back door. The robbers could not open the door, so they shot at the door with guns. Yao-xi's wife, Dai, who was over fifty years old, was shot and killed. The rest of his children and daughters-in-law were also shot and injured. Afterwards, Xie Ying-zheng, the district chief of the sixteenth district, reported to the County Court to send someone for an autopsy.

<p>The Finance Department has received an order from the provincial government to substantially reduce and exempt various excessive and miscellaneous levies in each county to relieve the suffering of the people. However, upon investigating the tax schedule submitted by Cheng County, it was discovered that there was an item called "Zhongzi Donation," which was levied at a rate of 3 yuan or 2 yuan per 100 yuan of contract price, depending on whether it was a sandy township or a canal township. Moreover, it was not collected by the county but directly by the Education Bureau. Since the Education Bureau is not a tax collection agency, how can it directly collect taxes? It is said that this "Zhongzi Donation" was approved in October of the tenth year. What authority approved it? What is the method of collection? Are there any regulations? County Magistrate Ruan was specially ordered to investigate and report separately for verification.</p>

<p>The Gao Gang area, which belongs to Yangqiao Township in the fifth district of Jiangdu, was originally a commercial port on the Dijie Continent in that township. Now, Wu Rui-bo and others from the seventh district of Taixing have petitioned the provincial department, claiming that although the port is under the jurisdiction of Jiangdu, it is located within the borders of Taixing County and requested that the port be transferred to Taixing. The department ordered the Eighth and Ninth District Commissioner's Offices and the Taixing County Government to dispatch personnel to conduct a joint survey. The residents near the port gathered more than a thousand people and surrounded the committee members, claiming that Gao Gang is part of the Dijie Continent belonging to Yangqiao Township and that there are grain warrants for the entire Dijie Continent as proof, and that there is a natural temple port as the boundary. Administrative matters are all under the jurisdiction of Jiangdu. The port is not an "embedded flower." The temporary defense corps of the port managed to break the siege, and the committee members declared that they would conduct a fair survey. The crowd then dispersed.</p>

<p>At the Huaiyin Chengnan Park Public Theater, during a performance of the "Mandarin Duck Bridge" scene on the 17th, at around 5:00 PM, a martial arts actor named Wei Yan-heng, known as "Nine-Year-Old Red" in the daily theater advertisements, was performing a scene of killing on the bridge. As he was about to perform a somersault from a high platform (made of two stacked tables), the tabletop under his feet suddenly collapsed, causing the martial arts actor to fall off the stage. He lost consciousness on the spot. Seeing the major disaster, the audience flocked away. The theater authorities saw that his injuries were serious and sent him to Renci Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, emergency injections of cardiac stimulants and various surgical procedures were performed. After an entire night, he finally regained consciousness slightly. However, his brain and skull were injured, and his abdomen and limbs had lost sensation. Whether his life is in danger is still difficult to predict.</p>

<p>Wutong Temple, located on the border of this county and Pinghu, is inhabited by Abbot Zhi-qing and six or seven monks who live by chanting scriptures. They have meager savings. This time, the bandits on the Chao Ni Beach set up gambling dens and made a big show, causing the residents to be on tenterhooks. Before long, more than twenty bandits, holding fast guns and box cannons, entered the temple and looted it. It is estimated that they looted more than a thousand yuan in cash and clothing. Before leaving, they tied up the abbot and beat him severely, causing him serious injuries.</p>

<p>In the former Confucian Academy on Wansong Ridge in Hangzhou, at around 1:00 PM the other day, Chai Afu Chen discovered that an old man, about fifty years old, had hanged himself on a tree in the courtyard. The old man was wearing a black Chinese jacket, black cotton trousers, and black socks and shoes, looking like a craftsman. He reported to the police station, which transferred the report to the Hangzhou District Court to send officials for an autopsy. It was determined that he had hanged himself. Since there were no family members, the Tongshan Hall prepared a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Wang Ren-hua, the county magistrate of Deqing, was accused by the people of violating the law and dereliction of duty. After investigation, he was dismissed from his post and handed over to the Hangzhou District Court for trial according to law. Because he repeatedly failed to appear in court, police officers were sent to arrest him. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhu opened a court session for interrogation. He is also suspected of overspending public funds and embezzling private property. As a result, evidence needs to be collected, and he was ordered to be detained in the detention center pending trial.</p>

<p>Zhou Jing-xin, a teacher at Renchu Elementary School near Bailong Town, Xiguan Township, Zhenhai, enticed Cai Liang-gui, a student at the school (now 16 years old), to Shanghai in September of this year and hid him in the Mengyuan Hotel. He instructed Liang-gui to write a letter home, falsely claiming that he had been kidnapped by bandits and that 1,000 yuan was required for ransom. The family ignored it. Zhou Jing-xin had no choice but to ask Cai Liang-gui to borrow money from his relatives in Shanghai. When Liang-gui was kidnapped and suddenly returned, they detained him and handed him over to his uncle, Cai Zi-xiang, to be taken back. When asked about the alleged kidnapping, it turned out that he had been fooled by Zhou Jing-xin. Zhou Jing-xin, seeing that his plan had failed, went from Shanghai to Ningbo and again used letters to threaten Cai Liang-gui's family, and instructed Cai's mother to discuss the matter at the Jiaotong Hotel in Ningbo. Yesterday, Cai's mother, her son Cai Liang-gui, and uncle Cai Zi-xiang met Zhou Jing-xin at the Jiaotong Hotel and immediately called the police to arrest Zhou and send him to the bureau for transfer to the court for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Fujian Army Invades Zhejiang, Three Routes of Advance <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the prelude to the great war of the Fujian army's invasion of Zhejiang has begun. According to news from this port yesterday morning, Jiang Guang-nai and Cai Ting-kai, after the general mobilization order, held a secret meeting of senior cadres with Chen Ming-shu and Dai Ji, with representatives of the Communist army attending. It was decided to attack Zhejiang in three routes, namely: (1) From northern Fujian, through Yanping, via the Xianxia Ridge to Changshan; (2) From Pingnan and Shouning to Xixi, invading Taishun; (3) From Xiapu and Fuding, crossing the Fen Shui Ridge to Pingyang. Currently, all three routes are advancing. According to an aerial reconnaissance report by central planes on the 18th, the main force of the Fujian army concentrated in Gutian is heading towards Pingnan, and the troops in Pingnan are advancing towards Shouning. The front line of Shouning has indeed reached Taishun in Zhejiang. The Fujian army on the Zhenghe southern route is also moving north. Furthermore, the secret meeting decided, based on the offensive and defensive alliance with the Red Army, to organize a front-line committee in the northern Fujian war zone, with Red bandit leaders Zhang Wen-tian and Mao Zedong's younger brother Mao Ze-tan participating in the committee to jointly preside over everything. The front-line committee has great power, in addition to commanding the various troops in combat, it also has the power to handle all political affairs in the war zone. In recent days, the central army in Jiangxi has been suppressing the Red bandits, gaining unprecedented victories. The defeated troops of the bandits have all fled to Fujian. To provide practical assistance to the pseudo-People's Revolutionary Army's invasion to the north, the bandit side is now actively organizing guerrilla units in Lanxi, Yongkang, Wenzhou, Ruian, and other places in Zhejiang, attempting to disrupt the rear of the central army.</p>

<h3 id="e126">All Passengers of the Yuji Shipwrecked Transported by Jiangyuan Warship Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The ship's hull has not yet sunk, and rescue workers have already gone to the scene</p>
<p>The Yuji ship of the Yu Da Company ran aground in the waters off Wenzhou. The passengers were rescued and transported in full by the Jiangyuan warship yesterday. Because the damage to the ship's hull was significant and the situation was dangerous, Lianbao and Yu Da have jointly dispatched the Sanjiang ship and hired engineers and workers to go to the scene for rescue. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notification by Japanese warship telegram: After the Yuji ship ran aground, the bow sank into the water. The ship's hull was affected by the first two cabins and has tilted, the situation is precarious. The ship's wireless radio has also been damaged and cannot communicate. The company has repeatedly telegraphed but received no response. It was not until 6:00 PM on the 20th that the Japanese Navy's 27th Destroyer Division, the Hishi, returned to Shanghai from Magong. Because there were Japanese crew members on board the Yuji, it stopped to assist. The shipowner, Abe Totaro, requested the ship to send a wireless telegram to Shanghai, stating that the first two cabins of the Yuji were still submerged in seawater and requesting Shanghai to send a rescue ship to the scene as soon as possible for rescue work. The Jiangyuan warship set sail that evening.</p>
<p>Discuss dispatching technicians and workers: The company received this telegram and immediately informed Lianbao Insurance Company. Because the telegram indicated that the repairs could be completed within a week if assistance was provided, Yu Da and Lianbao consulted with the Hongchang Machinery Factory, hired an engineer, a diver, four carpenters, and twelve workers, brought a large number of materials, and rented a water pump from Yesong to transport them to the scene of the accident to carry out the rescue. Lianbao paid 1,000 yuan in expenses. The workers all boarded the Daxon Company's Sanjiang ship, which departed from Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It is expected to arrive in the waters off Wenzhou this afternoon. The ship carried a lot of food for the crew to eat.</p>
<p>Passengers rescued to Shanghai: A total of 154 passengers from the ship, rescued by the Jiangyuan warship and transported to Shanghai, entered the port at around 3:00 PM yesterday and arrived at Gaochang Temple at 4:35 PM. A total of 75 passengers and 79 students from Chen Camp of the Mawei Navy also took the Yuji ship to Shanghai and were transported to Shanghai by the Jiangyuan warship. In addition, a second comprador of the Yuji also came to Shanghai on the Jiangyuan. When the warship arrived at the pier, the naval authorities sent soldiers to take care of them. After the students of the naval training camp landed, they temporarily resided in Gaochang Temple. It is said that they will go to Beijing in a few days. The passengers who arrived in Shanghai dispersed on their own. The soldiers and passengers brought about 100 pieces of luggage. The second comprador of the Yuji went to the company on Yongan Street to report the details of the shipwreck.</p>
<p>Passenger accounts: A passenger told the reporter that the Yuji accident occurred on the night of the 17th. At that time, all the passengers were asleep. They woke up when they heard the alarm. When they went out of the cabin to see, the first two cabins had already flooded. It was not until the morning of the 18th that the French postal ship Rosso arrived to rescue them and send a telegram to the Naval Department. It was not until 5:00 PM that the Jiangyuan and Chuguan arrived. We were able to transfer to the Jiangyuan warship. Because the transfer took time and we encountered wind and waves, we did not depart until yesterday afternoon and arrived in Shanghai today. No passengers were injured in this Yuji accident, and all the luggage and belongings were taken out. However, the cargo inside the ship was completely lost.</p>
<p>Crew members temporarily go to the lighthouse: According to the second comprador of the Yuji who reported to the company, the first and second cabins of the ship were cracked. Fortunately, the engine room and the stern of the ship were intact, so it would not sink immediately. All the crew members inside the ship, because the food had run out, the sailors, firemen, and crew members, about fifty people, are now on the Donggua Mountain lighthouse, waiting for the Shanghai rescue ship to transport food to rescue them. The Yuji ship's hull will not be sacrificed and can be rescued.</p>
<p>Warships protect the work: The company and Lianbao Insurance Company have dispatched a rescue ship and workers, prepared for a week, to repair the holes in the bottom of the ship and help with pumping water. Therefore, the Chuguan dispatched by the Navy is still stationed there for protection. The Japanese Navy's 27th Destroyer Division, the Hishi, is also staying at Donggua Mountain at the request of the shipowner, Abe. The Chuguan ship also sent many sailors to Donggua Mountain to protect the crew. According to the company, whether the Yuji can escape the disaster will depend on the true news after the Sanjiang arrives.</p>
<h3 id="e127">After the Arrest of Jin Xi, the Municipal Government Protests to the Japanese Consul-General, Who Has Already Replied <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Simple wording stating that Jin's entry into Chinese nationality was not recognized</p>
<p>Jin is still detained in the Japanese police station and has been interrogated several times</p>
<p>The case of Jin Xi, a Korean who had acquired Chinese nationality, being arrested in the French Concession by the Central Police Station of the French Concession with the assistance of the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai has already attracted attention from all circles. The municipal government authorities also believe that Jin Xi has acquired Chinese nationality, so they have already lodged a protest with the Japanese Consulate-General the other day. According to news from the municipal government yesterday morning, the Japanese Consulate-General's reply has already arrived at the city hall. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Japanese Consulate Has Already Replied <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, reporters from various newspaper agencies specially visited Yu Hong-jun, the Secretary-General of the municipal government, at the city hall for this matter. Mr. Yu was busy with official duties and sent Secretary Huang Shao-zhai to meet them on his behalf. According to the reply, the municipal government, since Jin Xi was arrested in the French Concession and transferred to the Japanese consulate, immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate Jin Xi's nationality and other issues. Based on the results of the investigation, a serious protest was lodged with the Japanese Consulate-General. After many days, the Japanese Consulate-General's reply has already arrived at the city hall. The wording is very simple, only elaborating on the issue of Jin Xi's entry into Chinese nationality. It is claimed that the Japanese government has not recognized Jin Xi's entry into Chinese nationality. In other words, Jin Xi's entry into Chinese nationality has not been approved by the Japanese government.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Public Letter from the Lawyers Association <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association yesterday sent a public letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, which stated: We are writing to inform you that our members Lou Yun-mei, Xu Jie, and others have sent a letter stating that they have been entrusted by the family of Jin Xi to negotiate the case of Jin Xi being illegally arrested by the French Central Police Station with the assistance of the Japanese Consulate (already reported in the previous newspaper). After investigation, Jin Xi, a Korean who has acquired Chinese nationality, has already obtained the nationality of the Republic of China, so the Japanese Consulate should not privately arrest him and disregard national sovereignty. The authorities of the French Concession, after assisting the Japanese Consulate in arresting Jin Xi, did not hand him over to the court for trial and judgment, but directly transferred him to the Japanese Consulate, which is deliberately undermining the agreement on the establishment of Chinese courts in the concession. It is their undeniable responsibility. The matter concerns national sovereignty and legal rights. Correspondingly, we request your government to continue protesting to the Japanese Consulate and the authorities of the French Concession, to achieve the goal of returning him to China and safeguarding national sovereignty. We are truly committed to public friendship. To the Shanghai Municipal Government, Shanghai Lawyers Association Standing Committee, 22, 12, 21.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Japanese Side Expresses Opinion on Jin <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency reporter who inquired at the Japanese Consulate-General, the consulate staff said that according to Japanese nationality regulations, any Korean who acquires any nationality is still regarded as Korean by the Japanese government. Because Koreans cannot have dual nationality, Jin Xi, who has acquired Chinese nationality, is still regarded as Korean. However, according to Zhang Ting-rong, director of the information office of the municipal government, the Japanese nationality regulations can only be applied within Japan. Jin Xi's arrest was in Chinese territory. This kind of explanation is obviously a sophistry.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Jin is Still Detained in the Japanese Police Station <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since Jin Xi was arrested in the French Concession and transferred to the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai, it has been many days. He is currently still detained in the Japanese Consulate Police Station and has been interrogated several times. He will not be transferred to Tokyo in the coming days.</p>

<p>An office will be established at the original site of Fenglin Bridge</p>
<p>The new building of the municipal government has been fully completed. Various bureaus will move in to work in succession starting from the 25th of this month. The Finance, Public Works, and Public Security Bureaus will postpone the relocation. The municipal government authorities have notified various foreign embassies and consulates of the relocation. However, fearing that outsiders may not know about the relocation of the municipal government, it has been decided to establish an office at the original site of the Fenglin Bridge municipal government for liaison purposes. The establishment period is scheduled for two months.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Suma to Depart for Fujian Today <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Sound Society, Suma Yakichiro, the information department head of the Japanese legation, has received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be transferred to the position of Consul-General in Nanjing. As he needs to listen to instructions from Uchida and Shigemitsu regarding the recent diplomatic policy towards China, and to report on the current political situation in China, it was decided that he would first return to Tokyo. He originally planned to take a connecting ship directly from Shanghai back to Japan, but later, due to the urgent need to understand the true situation in Fujian, he temporarily changed his itinerary and is scheduled to take the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Jiesheng" ship to Fujian today (the 22nd). He will visit the responsible authorities of the so-called People's Government. This is because when Suma was previously the Consul-General in Guangzhou, Chen Mingshu was the Chairman of Guangdong Province, and Suma had a very deep friendship with Chen. There are rumors that Fujian and Japan have a secret understanding, and that Fujian has a large Japanese sugar loan from Japan. However, the Japanese legation in this city has been making every effort to deny this. Yesterday morning, they even released a telegram from the Consul-General in Fuzhou, Moriya, to reporters, stating that the consumption of white sugar in Fujian Province is extremely low, and even if there is such a loan, it would be fundamentally impossible to redeem it for cash, proving it is not factual. Counselor Ota also solemnly denied it to reporters. He had previously tacitly acknowledged the matter to others. However, based on the observation of the situation, the Japanese side has always attached importance to the Fujian Incident. Given Suma's position and his relationships, this trip is definitely not a simple inspection, but must have considerable political significance. Furthermore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already appointed Counselor Kawasaka Tatsuo of the legation to succeed Suma in his original position as head of the legation's information department. Kawasaka previously served as the head of the information department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the head of the Foreign Affairs Division of the Kwantung Government. He is also extremely familiar with Chinese affairs. He recently traveled to various provinces in South China and returned to Shanghai from Guangdong yesterday morning. Minister Arima, in view of the tense situation in China and the importance of intelligence work, ordered him to take over Suma's former position immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e134">City-Wide Cleaning Campaign to be Held in This City <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>From the 25th to the 31st of this Month</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, as the end of the year approaches, will, as usual, launch a large-scale cleaning campaign from the 25th of this month. Furthermore, in view of the fact that in the past, shops and households in various streets and alleys arbitrarily dumped garbage, which was detrimental to hygiene, new methods for dumping garbage have been formulated in the jurisdiction of the Second District, Second Precinct of the Public Security Bureau for trial implementation. If successful, they will be extended to the entire city. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Designated Week for Campaign <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The cleaning campaign is scheduled to run from the 25th to the 31st of this month. The Municipal Health Bureau, together with the Municipal Public Security Bureau, will persuade shops and households to comply with the cleaning methods and implement the cleaning. Regarding factories, the Municipal Health Bureau will handle it together with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Regarding schools, the Municipal Health Bureau will hold cleaning lectures together with the Municipal Education Bureau, and the school authorities will order the students to assist their families in cleaning when they return home. The Municipal Health Bureau will be responsible for cleaning restaurants, shops, and various streets and alleys.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Garbage Disposal Methods <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau believes that the street-side garbage cans set up in the past have had many drawbacks, so new methods have been formulated as follows: 1. All existing garbage cans within the area (i.e., within the jurisdiction of the Second District, Second Precinct, as follows) will be removed from the 15th of the 23rd year of the Republic. Each shop will be responsible for providing its own garbage can and dumping the garbage into the garbage truck at the specified times. 2. The garbage dumping times will be twice a day, the first time from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and the second time from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. The street sweepers will notify the shops by ringing a bell. 3. The street sweepers should fulfill their responsibilities in collecting garbage. Shops are not allowed to give them any gratuities. If anyone extorts money, they can report it to the bureau for strict investigation. 4. The garbage can will be based on the house number, and the main household will be responsible for providing it for use by all families in the same house. Each house number must have at least one can. If there are many households in one house number, they must add more as appropriate. 5. The cost of preparing the garbage can will be borne by the head landlord. If the head landlord does not have a responsible person in Shanghai, the second landlord will pay for it first. If the second landlord is not in this place, the tenant will prepare it. The actual price will be deducted from the rent. The same applies when replacing it after it is damaged. If anyone refuses to acknowledge this, they can report it to the bureau for investigation. However, all residents should cherish the use of it and not deliberately damage it. 6. Residents along the road should immediately have someone take the garbage directly into the garbage truck after hearing the street sweeper ring the bell every day. Residents in the lanes should immediately dump the garbage into the truck as soon as the garbage truck enters the lane after hearing the bell. 7. All garbage cans must have a complete and tight-fitting lid. The style is as left (diagram omitted). 8. If any resident fails to prepare a garbage can within the time limit, they will be punished in accordance with the Administrative Execution Law.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Joint Public Notice by the Two Bureaus <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>A joint public notice by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Health Bureau states that although the matters of street cleaning and hygiene in this city have been reorganized several times, they have not yet achieved special effects. The reason is not entirely due to the lack of diligence in sweeping by the street sweepers and the insufficient application of garbage cans, but because citizens randomly dump garbage at any time and do not put garbage into the cans. Therefore, garbage cans are often seen empty, while the outside is littered with rubbish. Investigation and suppression are difficult to carry out thoroughly. In order to rectify the city appearance and prohibit vandalism, this bureau, etc., has submitted it to the municipal government for approval and decided to stop using the original public garbage cans within the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct of this Public Security Bureau from the 15th of January of the 23rd year of the Republic. Each shop must prepare a garbage can in the house, and the street sweepers of this Health Bureau will go to collect and transport it on time every day in order to avoid random dumping and maintain the cleanliness of the roads. All residents and shops within the area must prepare garbage cans as instructed before the 25th of this month. If they are not made after the deadline, this bureau, etc., will prepare them on their behalf and charge the price. In addition to making a sample of the garbage can and sending it to the Second Precinct of this Public Security Bureau for public viewing, the method is copied below and announced for general knowledge. This notice is issued by Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Li Ting'an, Director of the Health Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Large Quantities of Foreign Flour Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Merchants Suffer Losses Due to New Taxes</p>
<p>Chinese Factories Will Be Affected by Dumping</p>
<p>A large amount of American wheat flour has been shipped to Shanghai this year. Before the 10th of this month, various foreign merchants, upon hearing that the Jianghai Customs would add ten new taxes on New Year's Day next year, and that foreign flour imports would also be subject to tariffs, the flour merchants sent telegrams to the United States one after another, instructing them to ship large quantities of wheat flour to Shanghai as much as possible before December 31. Some of them had not yet been sold to the consignee, and they were also ordered to ship them out in advance for storage in Shanghai for successive sales in order to avoid paying import tariffs. After these telegrams were sent, American wheat flour was rushed to be shipped by rented ships at the beginning of this month. According to people in the shipping company in this city that loaded the American flour, there were hundreds of thousands of bags already en route. The first batch will be imported on the 23rd and 24th of this month. Unexpectedly, the Customs' new tax on foreign wheat and wheat flour was promulgated and implemented on the 16th, half a month earlier than the foreign merchants knew. This has made it difficult for various foreign merchants to advance or retreat regarding the huge amount of wheat flour that has already been shipped. If it is returned to the country, the shipping costs will be too high and the losses will be even greater. If it is shipped to Shanghai, the payment of new taxes will also require two or three hundred thousand yuan. It was reliably learned yesterday that it has been agreed to allow this batch of foreign flour en route to be shipped, and they will have to reluctantly pay the tax. In these ten days, huge amounts of foreign flour worth about one million yuan have been imported into Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Labor Dispute at the Two Railway Factories Was Not Resolved Yesterday <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>All the workers at the Wusong and Zhanghuabang Railway factories went on strike due to the expulsion of the head of the General Affairs Department, Mo Heng. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday was the third day of the strike. All the workers still entered the factory at the usual working time, and dispersed to go home at 4:00 p.m., but they did not work in the factory and implemented a strike system. The order was still good. The craftsmen either read newspapers in the factory or chatted in the factory gate trade union. It is said that the strike seemed to be caused by the transfer of Cao Wenkui, a clerk in the Material Department, but in fact, after Director Mo concurrently served as the Director of Materials, the low quality of various materials purchased was unbearable for use. The workers resented the fact that the materials could not be used for work, which was a major reason for the strike. It was also said that when Sun Xuexiu, the former Director of Materials, was in office, he had to submit the samples and prices of the materials to the General Affairs Department for approval before they could be used. Now, the general affairs materials are all under the jurisdiction of Mo Heng. The situation in this regard can be clearly understood by discerning people. Yesterday, the Party Headquarters of the Two Railways, fearing that the situation would escalate, specially appointed Zhang Yunhe, the director of the Organization Section, Min Luoding, the standing director, and Cai Jinghai, a standing member, to come to Song after 3:00 p.m. They convened a meeting of all the workers in the factory gate trade union to give speeches, mostly advising the workers to wait for the Party Headquarters to meet with the superiors to resolve the matter. It was not until 4:00 p.m. that they dispersed.</p>
<p>It is also reported that, in view of the serious situation of the strike wave of workers at the Wusong machine factory on both routes, the Railway Bureau invited representatives from the Party Headquarters and the trade union yesterday (the 21st) to discuss a proper solution. It was decided to first form an investigation committee to thoroughly investigate the points of attack on Mo Heng. The candidates for the committee are Yuan Boyang, Wang Bi, Fan Shouzhi, Lu Baogao, and Pu Dengqing from the Bureau, Zou Kexin, Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, and Xie Chengyu from the Party Headquarters of the Two Railways, and Min Luoding and Chen Bohua from the trade union. It is now scheduled for the above-mentioned 11-member committee to go to Wusong at 8:00 a.m. this morning to persuade the workers to resume work first, and at the same time, immediately start investigating the charges against Mo Heng, and complete the investigation within two weeks. During the thorough investigation period, Mo Heng will be suspended from his duties.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Installing Wireless Radio Alarms on Cars <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Contract Signed with the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Installation to Begin in February Next Year</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the economy in this city has been declining in recent years, and there are many unemployed, which has led to desperate acts by restless elements. Robberies and kidnappings occur from time to time. The Public Concession Municipal Council has signed a contract with the Radio Protection Company to install wireless radio alarms on cars to provide security protection for citizens and increase the protection power of the police stations. The contract has been signed and installation has begun. According to a Central News Agency reporter, the details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e151">Contract Contents <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Radio Protection Company is managed by Mr. Li, a Chinese. Because kidnappings occur frequently in the Concession, the company requested the Public Concession Municipal Council in September to sign a contract to install wireless radio alarms and must grant it a three-year patent. After repeated discussions, the contract was signed on the 14th of this month. The main points of the contract are: (1) The Municipal Council allows the company to install wireless radio alarm radios in the designated police stations within three years. All installation costs will be borne by the company. (2) The Municipal Council is not responsible for compensation for future damages, etc. (3) The Municipal Council allows the police stations to immediately dispatch for rescue after receiving alarm reports, but the Municipal Council is not responsible if good results cannot be obtained. In addition, when alarm users install this type of wireless radio alarm with the company, they must sign a contract and pay a deposit of 25 yuan. If an alarm user falsely reports after installation, they will be fined 25 yuan each time. If there are three false reports, their alarm will be confiscated. (4) The Municipal Council and the Radio Protection Company both have the right to refuse alarm users to install this type of alarm. (5) If the company violates the provisions of this contract, the Municipal Council may suspend its business, but must notify it six months in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Alarm Effectiveness <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>This type of alarm is specially installed on cars and is shaped like an electric bell installed on a door. When a car equipped with this type of alarm suddenly encounters bandits on the road, it can press the bell once, and the police station's radio will receive a very detailed alarm, including (1) where the car is, (2) the color and license plate number of the car, (3) the owner of the car, etc., all of which can be clearly known. After receiving the report, the police station will send out police officers to search for and capture the bandits. The method of use is extremely simple. The installation price of this type of alarm is 1,500 yuan per unit, and 200 yuan per year for the second year and below.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Installation to Begin <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>After the contract was signed, the Radio Protection Company installed wireless radios in the police stations. It is expected to be fully completed by the end of January next year, so the company has scheduled to begin installing alarm users' alarms on February 1 next year. The installation location of the alarm is inside the front of the car, while the bell-pressing mechanism can be installed next to any seat. After this device is implemented, those who ride in cars can be much safer, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Western Newspaper Reports <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that a group of Chinese businessmen in this city have established a Wireless Protection Company. In September, the Shanghai Municipal Council granted the company a three-year exclusive license to operate a wireless alarm service in the International Settlement. A detailed contract was subsequently signed on December 13. The company is now actively preparing to commence operations in February of next year. According to the license and contract granted by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the company will provide and maintain wireless receiving sets for all police stations, at the company's expense. These receiving sets will work in conjunction with automatic wireless transmitters installed in private automobiles. Whenever a vehicle equipped with such a transmitter encounters danger, such as being accosted by bandits, a simple press of a button will transmit an alarm to all police stations, indicating the vehicle's location, type, and other necessary details. The police can then quickly rush to the scene to provide assistance. The company expects to complete all preparations by the end of January next year, and will begin accepting subscribers in early February. It is said that each subscriber will be required to pay an installation fee of approximately 1,500 yuan, as well as an annual maintenance fee of several hundred yuan, although the first year's fee is excluded. This ingenious device was invented by a European who wishes to remain anonymous. After contacting several Chinese businessmen, he arranged for them to invest in and establish the Wireless Protection Company. Although New York City also uses wireless alarm systems, the system to be implemented in Shanghai is different and far more sophisticated. When the company initially applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for an exclusive license, the council ordered a trial to demonstrate its effectiveness. Chief Inspector E.W. Everson and other senior police officers supervised multiple trials, all of which were deemed satisfactory. Mr. Everson then formally applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for the company to be granted an exclusive license. It is said that several police officers, including those in the Chief Inspector's intelligence division, are currently receiving training on how to operate these wireless receivers, which will be installed in all police stations. If the current number of personnel is insufficient, additional personnel will be assigned, at the company's expense. The company will maintain absolute confidentiality regarding its subscribers, so that bandits intercepting vehicles will be unaware that the police are about to arrive. It is also said that the company will soon apply to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the French Municipal Council for permission to operate this service exclusively within their jurisdictions. This will allow vehicles equipped with this device to travel anywhere in Shanghai without fear of danger.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Xu Yongzuo Improves Chinese Bookkeeping <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Types of Improved Account Formats</p>
<p>Successful Trials by Various Organizations, Companies, and Businesses</p>
<p>Chinese bookkeeping, as it exists today, can be broadly divided into two schools: Chinese and Western. Western bookkeeping uses horizontal registration, and the paper, ink, and writing instruments are all imported. The principles and methods of accounting are rigidly adhered to Western practices, making imitation not only difficult but also costly. Chinese bookkeeping uses vertical recording, and the paper, ink, and writing instruments are all domestic products. The principles and methods of accounting are familiar to the Chinese people, but the system is poor and lacks organization, resulting in chaos and confusion that undermine the fundamental principles of accounting. As a result, it is often criticized. Mr. Xu Yongzuo, an accountant in this city, has compiled more than thirty types of improved Chinese accounting books and forms based on more than ten years of research. Each type comes with detailed instructions, and a separate book, "An Introduction to Improved Chinese Bookkeeping," provides an overall explanation of the entire improvement plan. It has now been handed over to Standard Accounting Form and Document Manufacturing Co. for high-quality printing on domestic paper and is available for public sale. In this year of promoting domestic goods, this great work of organizing national essence and promoting domestic goods is particularly worthy of social attention. A reporter from the New Sound Society has made a special effort to investigate and record the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Improvement Process <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Between 1918 and 1919, the Shanghai Bank Weekly opened a special column for accounting research, publicly studying the science of accounting and bookkeeping. At that time, the newspaper was edited by Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu then became familiar with the accountant's business. He had more contact with Chinese bookkeeping and studied it in detail. In 1927, the China Economics Society invited him to give a lecture at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The topic of the lecture was "Improving Chinese Accounting Problems." At that time, Jinan University and Shanghai Business College also invited him to give lectures, forming a movement to improve Chinese bookkeeping. In 1928, the former Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Commerce advocated improving bookkeeping and specially appointed Mr. Xu as a member of the committee. In the same year, the Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants, at the request of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, established a special committee to improve bookkeeping, and Mr. Xu was elected as a member. When the former Bureau of Industry and Commerce convened the National Industry and Commerce Conference, Mr. Xu participated in the event. In 1929, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a letter inviting Mr. Xu to take charge of planning the improvement of bookkeeping. At that time, there was no consensus on whether to promote Western bookkeeping or abandon Chinese bookkeeping, so there were no concrete measures. In the past four or five years, Mr. Xu has been entrusted by major companies, firms, and organizations to plan bookkeeping organizations. For those who have been using Chinese bookkeeping, Mr. Xu has formulated improved Chinese bookkeeping methods. Since the trial implementation, the results have been remarkable. Even large-scale businesses have found it convenient to implement. In order to popularize the improvement of bookkeeping in China, Mr. Xu has recently spent half a year, based on China's inherent system and taking into account the latest theories in the world, using the most economical and practical methods, to compile a systematic and organized plan for improving Chinese bookkeeping, stipulating more than thirty types of account book and form formats, and compiling and publishing a book called "An Introduction to Improved Chinese Bookkeeping."</p>
<h3 id="e157">Trial Results <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Over the past four or five years, Mr. Xu has formulated improved Chinese bookkeeping organizations for major companies, firms, and organizations. It is said that about fifty companies have effectively implemented them, such as Wuzhou Pharmacy, Sino-British Pharmacy, Jicheng Pharmacy, Taihe Pharmacy, Nanyang Tobacco Company, Huacheng Tobacco Company, Zhongnan Tobacco Company, Zhonghe Tobacco Company, Zhonghua Book Company, World Book Company, Datong Book Company, Shanghai Inland Tap Water Company, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company, Star Film Company, Central Film Company, Star Grand Theater, Far East Public Sports Ground, Tianyi Printing Company, Sanyi Printing Company, China Commercial Savings Bank, Renjihe Insurance Company, Huaan Insurance Company, Huacheng Insurance Company, Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, Hua Textile Dyeing Factory, Jiu Ji Timber Company, Dafeng Textile Company, Taishan Brick and Tile Company, Yizhong Fuji Porcelain Company, Guohua Coal Ball Company, China Match Company, Taikang Food Company, Chengmao Food Company, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Joint Association of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories, Siming Guildhall, Xinwei Relief Society, Pushan Villa, Zhabei Charity Group, Xin Puyu Hall, Weizhong Shantang Lianyi Shanhui, Shangxian Hall, Women and Children's Hospital, Silk and Satin Trade Association Hangzhou Silk Group, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Improved Features <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>According to accountant Xu Yongzuo, who spoke to a reporter from the New Sound Society, the ten major features of improved Chinese bookkeeping are: (1) Old-style Chinese account books only have two columns, upper and lower, with amounts, reasons, and notes all recorded in one place, making it inconvenient to record and even more difficult to check accounts. Improved Chinese account books are all printed with a fixed format. A certain grid records the reason, a certain grid records the amount, a certain grid records the date, and a certain grid records the page number, all clearly divided, so recording and reviewing are very convenient. (2) Old-style Chinese account books have never had a fixed registration method. How should our account books be registered? There is no standard, and the bookkeeper has complete freedom. Improved Chinese account books have detailed instructions printed on the last page of each account book, explaining the nature and usage of each account book. The bookkeeper can follow these instructions. (3) Old-style Chinese bookkeeping procedures have never been fixed, resulting in numerous errors and loopholes. In improved Chinese account books, the last page of each account book should have thirty-two bookkeeping rules for bookkeepers to follow. All procedures regarding opening accounts, recording accounts, posting accounts, and closing accounts are strictly regulated. (4) In Chinese customs, personnel in charge of account books generally do not indicate their names in the account books. When there are discrepancies or errors, they often push the blame onto each other, making it difficult to hold them accountable afterward. Improved account books have a list of personnel in charge printed on the first page. First, the name of the account book, the name of the person in charge, and the date of acceptance should be filled in one by one, and then bookkeeping can begin. The same applies when handing over the account book, so the responsibilities of the bookkeepers are clearly defined. (5) Our old-style account books are not paginated, so pages are often missing or torn out. This is a source of fraud for bookkeepers. Improved Chinese account books stipulate that account books are divided into three types: fifty pages, one hundred pages, and one hundred and fifty pages. The number of pages is pre-determined, which not only prevents fraud but also allows each other to indicate the page numbers when posting accounts, making it easier to review. (6) Our old-style account books only have two types: running ledgers, which do not have borders, and meal ledgers, which have borders. This is too simple and cannot be applied to various industries. The formats of improved Chinese account books, including application forms, total more than thirty types, most of which are available for various industries. (7) Old-style Chinese businesses have never had so-called forms, which is a major flaw in accounting organization. It should be known that forms have evidentiary effect, reconciliation function, and overview function in bookkeeping, which are indispensable. Improved Chinese and Western account books have seven important forms. All commonly used forms are complete. (8) Leaving aside the difficulty of obtaining Western bookkeeping talent, the fact that paper, ink, and writing instruments must be imported, resulting in high prices and heavy expenses, is already too uneconomical. The materials used in improved Chinese and Western account books are all domestic products, and the binding and printing are both exquisite. Compared with Western account books, there is a meaning of promoting domestic goods, and compared with old-style account books, there is the advantage of high-quality materials. (9) Accounting is ultimately not something that can directly generate profits, so the accounting department should strive for cost savings. Every time Western bookkeeping is adopted, if the scale is slightly larger, several thousand yuan must be spent on account books and forms every year, which is too wasteful. Improved Chinese account books have beautiful materials and low prices. Not only are they cheaper than Western account books, but they are also more economical than old-style account books. (10) The organization of improved Chinese bookkeeping account books, the classification of accounts, and the nature and usage of their various contents are all explained in detail in "An Introduction to Improved Chinese Bookkeeping." All new and old bookkeeping personnel can understand it after browsing. If there is anything unclear, you can consult the Xu Accountant Firm at No. 38 Edward Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Assassination of Tang Jiapeng Case <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Rebuttal Argument Concluded</p>
<p>The Sentence Must Be Pronounced Again</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World entertainment venue, was shot and killed by assassins in front of the Great World at 2:00 a.m. on June 18 of this year. A passerby, Wu Guangcai, was also killed by stray bullets. After the incident, detectives from the French police special agency successively arrested the criminals Zhang Tinggui (alias Xiao Sizi), a native of Funing, and Zhao Guangfu, a native of Yangzhou. A White Langlin pistol used by Zhao to kill Tang was recovered. They were handed over to the Second Special District Local Court and prosecuted for premeditated murder. After several court hearings and interrogations, the police verified that three of the eight bullet casings found at the scene matched Zhao's pistol. The defendants also confessed that they were entrusted by Wang Jinkui, who is still at large, to collude with Zhou Ershuishui, a carpenter who is also at large, to carry out the shooting. The trial had been declared concluded, and the sentencing was originally scheduled for the day before yesterday, as reported in the previous newspaper. The presiding judge, Wu Fanglian, has now reviewed the entire case and determined that it is still necessary to investigate whether the four bullets extracted by doctors from the body of the deceased, Tang Jiapeng, in the hospital were fired from the pistol in question. Therefore, on the day before yesterday, Judge Wu went to the First Criminal Court and ordered the two defendants, Zhang and Zhao, to be brought before the court. He announced the cancellation of the conclusion of the rebuttal argument, briefly interrogated the two defendants, and ordered that the rebuttal argument be reopened on the 29th of the month.</p>

<p>The World Actually Has Such Absurd Things</p>
<p>Zhang Shunsheng, a native of Yixing, is already sixty-eight years old. He used to work as a tax collector in the local county government, but he has recently retired due to old age. His son, Zhang Yaonan (alias Chen Peigen), is twenty-eight years old and cannot inherit his father's career. He is dedicated to wandering and is especially fond of women. He formed an inextricable relationship with Yan Hongbao, a young woman from the same village. Yan is only twenty-two years old and has a stunning appearance, which makes Yaonan even more infatuated. Last month, he listened to Yan's instigation and took his twelve-year-old younger sister, Zhang Shunmei, from his hometown to Wuxi, intending to sell her. They stayed in Wuxi for a long time, but no one inquired. So they took Yan and her sister and took Shunmei from Wuxi to Shanghai by military transport. Along the way, he ordered Shunmei to call Hongbao "mother" to disguise their true relationship. As expected, they did not reveal any flaws. After arriving in Shanghai, Yaonan returned to his hometown alone, and handed Shunmei over to Hongbao for her to dispose of freely. Hongbao solicited in many directions, and finally sold her a few days ago to Jiang Ximei, an eighteen-year-old young woman living at No. 24 Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road, for 210 yuan. At that time, Ximei also thought that Hongbao and Shunmei were mother and daughter. Only after the transaction was completed did she realize that there were never mothers and daughters who were only ten years apart in age. She became very suspicious and repeatedly questioned Shunmei, only to learn the truth. Fearing that concealing the truth would cause trouble in the future, she immediately tried to notify the girl's father, Zhang Shunsheng, to come to Shanghai to resolve the matter. However, the old man was unfamiliar with the place and had no way to find them after arriving. Later, he asked his clansman, Zhang Shouqing, to help him find them. Yesterday, father and daughter were reunited. He wanted to take her home immediately, but Jiang Ximei demanded 300 yuan in compensation, otherwise she would not return the girl. The old man argued with her, and during the conflict, the matter was reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station. After investigating, the police arrested Yan Hongbao for kidnapping. Her sister and Zhang Yaonan had already left Shanghai and could not be arrested. Yesterday, the police escorted Yan to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated her. The police representative, lawyer Zhang Shizhu, explained the case. Later, Jiang Ximei also hired lawyer Fan Gang to the court to file an incidental civil suit against the defendant to recover the purchase price. After careful interrogation by Judge Feng, Yan Hongbao was sentenced to one year in prison. The girl was taken away by Zhang Shunquan. Jiang Ximei's request for compensation for the purchase price should be filed in a separate lawsuit.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government has now received an order from the provincial government that the province's loan of grain transport, which started in 1930 and was scheduled to end in 1934, will be repaid at a rate of 90 cents per stone. However, due to the floods in 1931 and the aftermath of the floods in 1932, coupled with the impact of the Shanghai War, the repayment has been repeatedly delayed. This year, the repayment should have been made in accordance with the regulations, but the budget was already insufficient, and the cancellation of the additional grain transport of two yuan per stone made things even more difficult. After struggling to overcome the difficulties, the decision was made to extend the loan of grain transport for another year in accordance with the previous year's decision. County Magistrate Pan has instructed the Land Tax Office to comply with the order.</p>

<p>Representative Pang Songhui Comes to Shanghai to Appeal</p>
<p>The Chambers of Commerce of Qinlian Counties, regarding the case of confiscated native sugar, jointly appointed Representative Pang Songhui to go to the province and Beijing to petition. Representative Pang paid a visit to Customs Superintendent Tang Haian the day before yesterday, requesting a reversal of the unjust case of sugar merchants in Beihai being fined. Superintendent Tang was out on official business, and Secretary-General Tang received him, promising to do his best to assist in resolving the case within the scope of his authority. After leaving the Superintendent's Office, Representative Pang went to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to meet with Secretary Gu Huaibing. In addition to detailing the reasons for requesting assistance, Representative Pang also presented a joint official letter from the Qinlian Chambers of Commerce. Mr. Gu stated that since the case of Cantonese native sugar being confiscated and forfeited had occurred, the Federation had repeatedly appealed on behalf of the sugar merchants. Now, based on the special circumstances described in the letter, he will submit it to the representative to take to Beijing and present it separately to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Customs Administration, and the Ministry of Industry for a thorough resolution to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Finally, Representative Pang, at the invitation of Zheng Zenan, chairman of the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, went to meet him at 3:00 p.m. to discuss the details of the case and discuss assistance measures. Mr. Zheng stated that he had been selected as a member of the National Production Conference and had sent survey forms to various sugar-producing areas in the province to collect materials in order to pass the most effective proposal to protect native sugar at the future conference and implement it nationwide to maintain local products. It is also heard that Representative Pang will soon go to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified all trade associations yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, on the 20th of this month, we received Order No. 17241 from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, which stated, 'We have received Order No. 7454 from the Municipal Government, which stated, "We have approved Advisory Letter No. 20910 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which stated, "All chambers of commerce and industrial and commercial trade associations in various places should comply with Article 19 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, which states, 'The term of office of executive and supervisory committee members is four years, with half of them being re-elected every two years, and they may not be re-elected consecutively.'" It has been found that most of those who have re-elected in accordance with the law and submitted their names for record have done so, but there are also those who have not completed the re-election matters upon the expiration of the two-year term and have submitted them to the Ministry for review, which is unavoidable. According to Article 19 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law, "When a reorganization or re-election is due, the current officers shall be responsible for handling it. If it cannot be completed by the deadline, they shall not continue to exercise their powers." Therefore, groups whose re-election is due should not be negligent, lest they harm themselves. If the public association and the chamber of commerce are both due for re-election, the election of the public association should be held before the election of the chamber of commerce in order to comply with the procedures and avoid disputes.

<p>Christmas: Religious Donors Actively Contribute</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association at No. 12 Renji Road was founded in Shanghai by both Chinese and Western people and has a considerable history of more than twenty years. Since the disaster relief in North China, it has saved countless people's lives, making it a relief charity organization that is uniquely trusted by both Chinese and foreigners. Although the board members are divided into Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Catholicism, and Christianity, there is no distinction in relief work, and they all treat everyone equally, working together harmoniously. As Christmas approaches, it is heard that Catholics and Christians are actively raising funds to be handed over to the association to help the disaster victims in various places. It is fitting that the north wind is cold, and the survivors after the catastrophe long for relief as they long for the New Year. It is deeply hoped that all sectors will share this enthusiasm and not shirk their responsibilities, using the money spent on food and drink to ward off the cold to provide life-saving soup for the poor. Then, benefiting the hungry crows will be no small matter.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government believes that the field, housing, and deed taxes are allocated to the public bond fund, which is related to national credit. Recently, it has been found that many households are still concealing and failing to pay deed taxes, so it has issued a notice to households in various districts, urging them to pay the taxes at the county office as soon as possible. If there is any concealment, they will be severely punished if found.</p>
<p>In addition, the county government has recently received an order from the Finance Department stating that private land and housing sales are generally in cash, but the current silver prices are very different. In the future, people who pay deed taxes in cash should be calculated in three categories: before the Qing Dynasty, during the Republic of China, and after 1927, to show fairness. The county government has instructed the Deed Tax Office to comply with the order.</p>

<p>Electricity Will Be Supplied Starting Today</p>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company, in order to supply electricity economically during the transition period, in addition to its own installed capacity of 600 kilowatts, also purchased 2,000 kilowatts of electricity from the Chinese Electric Company to supplement it. Fearing that the electricity supply was limited and insufficient for development, it signed a contract with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in February of this year to purchase an annually increasing amount of 500 kilowatts of electricity to be transferred to the three districts of Gaoqiao, Gaohang, and Luxing, as well as the northern part of the Yangjing district. All wiring projects have been actively prepared for over half a year and have been gradually completed. Electricity will be supplied starting today. The details of the various projects are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e169">Building a Distribution Substation <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>In January of this year, the company purchased two mu, five fen, eight li, and three hao of land along the Pu River in Taojiazhai, Gaohang District. Because the terrain was low-lying, it hired workers to fill the land with mud to bring it level with the levee and built wooden fences around it to prevent tidal erosion. A two-story distribution room was built. The upper floor is equipped with receiving and distribution equipment, and the lower floor is equipped with cables. Four worker dormitories were also built next to the room, which were gradually completed in October of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Burying the Under-River Cables <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The location of the cables crossing the river is of utmost importance. After repeated surveys, it was decided to be on the Pudong bank of the Wuchuan Road North Jun Gong Road East in Zhabei, (about 1,130 meters south of the Qiu River Port). First, a submarine cable was buried to cross the Huangpu River to the company's distribution substation in Pudong. In July of this year, an order was placed with the British firm Kai Nengda for a 920-meter-long submarine cable with three steel cores, a cross-sectional area of 125 square millimeters, oil paper insulation, lead pipe wrapping, and double steel strip armor. In July of this year, an order was placed with the British firm Kai Nengda for a submarine cable 920 meters in length with three steel cores, a cross-sectional area of 125 square millimeters, oil paper insulation, lead pipe wrapping, and double steel strip armor. In order to protect the cables, Chinese "Cable Crossing, No Anchoring" warnings were posted on each bank of the river. One warning sign was placed on each bank of the river cable crossing. The signs were lit at night, and a joint notice was issued by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Utility Bureau. The Jianghai Customs Port Authority also issued a notice strictly prohibiting all vessels from anchoring in the area to avoid damaging the cables and hindering the power supply.</p>

<p>The distribution room is divided into nine compartments with reinforced concrete partition walls. Three compartments are equipped with power receiving equipment, and six compartments are equipped with power distribution equipment. All meters and oil switches are installed by Huatong Electrical Machinery Factory. After testing, they are in good condition.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Installing Power Lines <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>According to the original plan, the power output lines from the electrical room are divided into north and south lines, reserving space for three lines to prepare for future expansion in the distribution room. Six reinforced concrete power poles are erected on the east side, using angle iron as the frame, to install the underground cable junction boxes and lightning arresters on them, connecting to the north and south main power lines. The north main line extends from Gaoqiao Port to Jiangxinsha, and the Gaoqiao Town south line extends to Donggou Town, connecting to the newly installed pole lines recently set up on Pudong Road. After electrification today, it will first supply the Jiangxinsha and Gaoqiao Town areas. Within three months, it will be gradually extended to Donggou, Yangjing, Qichangzhan, Lujiazhai, Lannidu, and other places, switching to the Zhabei power source. In the future, the company will have ample reserves and reliable power supply, and the prospects for business are indeed promising.</p>

<p>Tonghaili, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou, in this city, has been experiencing an unexplained water outage since the morning of the 19th of this month, causing great panic among residents. Yesterday, they specially sent representatives to petition the Public Works Department, resulting in a satisfactory outcome. The following is a record of the various situations obtained by the Xin Xin News Agency reporter yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e174">Automatically Opening Water Pipes <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Tonghaili, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou, in this city, has been experiencing an unexplained water outage since 10:00 a.m. on the 10th of this month, causing immediate panic among all the residents, totaling over two thousand people. They immediately elected four representatives, Liu Zhenbo, Tang Fengming, Chen Shirong, and Chen Wenyun, to petition the Public Works Department at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, requesting assistance. Mr. Hede Kui, the Director-General of the Bureau, received them, and the result was quite satisfactory. After the representatives left, they reported the progress of the petition to the residents. By 2:00 p.m., all the residents, due to the water outage lasting three days and their lives being in imminent danger, automatically opened the Taiping water pipe in the area for emergency relief. At that time, the water company also sent several foreigners to the area to open the Taiping faucet, allowing residents to freely use the water.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Holding a Water Outage Meeting <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Real Estate Department of the China Reclamation Bank, the Tonghaili water outage meeting took place at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. The Real Estate Department of our bank sent Yao Mianqun to attend, and had detailed discussions with the residents' representatives, Cheng Haishan and Liu Zhenji, etc. Both sides were able to understand each other's difficulties and were quite close to an agreement. The Western representatives also temporarily opened the Taiping faucet to provide assistance. As for future solutions, if the residents can cooperate sincerely, it is planned to dig an artesian well, which would be a permanent solution.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Sanbei Jing'an Steamer Collides with Wharf Barges in the Huangpu River <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Those with minor damage have already received compensation.</p>
<p>The Jing'an steamer, purchased by the Sanbei Company from the Ministry of Navy for 260,000 yuan, was converted into passenger berths, cabins, and the hull was repaired after it was taken over. It is planned to open a new Shanghai-Qingdao route next month, and the steamer will run on the Shanghai-Qingdao route. It is planned to increase the speed to 13 nautical miles per hour, so that Shanghai to Qingdao will only take one day, which will surely be welcomed by passengers. Therefore, the layout of the various cabin classes of the steamer is very elaborate. The repair is now largely complete, and the opening date is approaching. The company ordered the Jing'an steamer to depart from the Sanbei Shipyard at about 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, and to go to Gaochangmiao to the Jiangnan Shipyard to inspect the bottom of the ship. However, when the ship reached the Huangpu River in front of the Bailianjing Wharf in Nan Huangpu, the Fengxiang Steamer of Taifeng Foreign Firm was anchored there. At that time, the tide was very rapid, and the Jing'an Steamer was eager to avoid the Fengxiang to avoid a collision. At this time, the hull was impacted by the rapid tide, and was dragged horizontally and suddenly pulled down the pier dolphin of the Dalai Wharf, causing considerable damage. At the same time, three wharf boats of Jinfusheng and Jie Jinfashe parked there were also damaged. Boat No. 8037 had the head damaged, boat No. 8189 had the stern damaged, and a large hole was smashed in the propeller. Boat No. 8592 also had the stern damaged, resulting in heavy losses. After the incident, the boatmen of each boat reported to the Water Patrol Room, and went to the Sanbei Company yesterday morning to negotiate and demand compensation. Later, the company sent personnel to inspect and confirmed the facts. It has agreed to compensate for the damaged boats and has paid compensation to the two boats that were slightly damaged. The remaining damage to the wharf dolphins, etc., is still under negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e177">The China National Yarn Purchasing Office Commences Business <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Cooperation between the Cotton Textile and Yarn Industry</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zilian, a leader in the cotton textile industry in this city, and Zheng Hairuo, etc. of the knitting industry, considering that the national crisis is increasingly urgent, believe that promoting domestic yarn is the only way to save the precarious yarn industry. Therefore, they gathered capital and initiated the National Yarn Purchasing Office, specializing in the sales of various brands of yarn for various Chinese textile factories, and invited leaders of various industries that need yarn to join the initiative, with the aim of achieving universal use of domestic yarn and recovering rights and interests. All shares are fully subscribed by the initiators, and a three-story building at the southern entrance of Guizhou Road and Nanjing Road has been rented as a store to start business, and all cotton weaving factories and yarn shops have been notified. The following is a record of its declaration: Dumping policies are the most poisonous methods used by international capitalist countries against weak nations. International capitalist countries know that weak nations cannot escape their shackles in contradictory economic phenomena, which is enough to satisfy their high degree of oppression and maintain their own life. In particular, the consistent plan of Japanese imperialism to invade China is aimed at dumping policies. In order to realize its poisonous plan, it is bound to break our country's nascent industrial front, form greater chaos, and accelerate the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race. The lost land of Liaodong has not been recovered, and the traces of war in northern Shanghai still remain. Japanese yarn and Japanese thread are active in the cotton weaving industry and have become invincible. Small-scale cotton weaving factories do not need to rely on this as a source of livelihood. Is this because people's hearts are incurable? The abandonment of personal interests dominates their actions, and traitors then deceive and lure them, disregarding the survival of the entire nation. This kind of economic traitor created by the environment, although his stupidity is beyond reach, his feelings are indeed excusable. We have been devoted to the cotton weaving industry for more than ten years, and deeply know the situation and abuses in this industry. Sitting and talking cannot help the facts, and action is the only way to achieve success. Therefore, the China National Yarn Purchasing Office Co., Ltd. is organized at the southern entrance of Guizhou Road and Nanjing Road in Shanghai, gathering all domestic yarn, setting the lowest prices, and striving to promote sales, so that goods have a place to go, and traitors cannot mix fish eyes with pearls and carry out their conspiracy to deceive and profit. The overall situation is in the front, and we will go all out to make cotton weaving factories use domestic yarn as much as possible, so that our country's textile industry will not be oppressed by the dumping policy of Japanese imperialism and be on the verge of bankruptcy. Cotton weaving factories can use pure domestic raw materials to create finished products, providing the country's people with the supplies they need, leaving a glimmer of hope for the national economy, and turning misfortune into good fortune. Furthermore, we will urge the improvement of textile factory products and the improvement of economic organization, so that the economic relationship with cotton weaving factories is harmonious and close, and we will struggle with Japanese imperialism in the economic market. We know that our strength is weak and we dare not be complacent. We vow to make sincere efforts and strive to fight. We hope that the gentlemen of the country will advance and teach us. We hereby declare.</p>

<p>Subscribes to Promote Shares of 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Mayor Shi of the capital deeply feels that foreign goods are rampant, not only causing endless leaks, but also harming people's livelihood. Therefore, he has recently made every effort to lead the citizens to carry out the national product promotion movement to establish the psychology of constructing and transforming the use of national products. In addition to joining the initiators of the Shanghai China National Products Sales United Company, he has also strongly advocated it.

<p>The Taxpaying Chinese Association Has Sent a Letter to the French Authorities for Verification and Reply</p>
<p>The Taxpaying Chinese Association of the French Concession recently received another letter from the Shanghai Apartment Industry Association, stating in brief: "Our industry has previously requested your association to negotiate with the French authorities regarding the Central, Datong, and Xindu apartments being subjected to increased taxation due to the relocation of houses. This time, the French authorities increased the taxation of the three apartments. Our industry has truly understood the situation. Checking Yueleli on Aiduya Road and Daodeli on Beile Road are also areas under the jurisdiction of the French authorities. Moreover, the three apartments have not engaged in any illegal activities since the relocation of houses. The French authorities are truly self-contradictory. It has been two months since the three apartments were subjected to increased taxation. If no active negotiations are carried out, the third month of taxation will be collected. Your association has the duty to protect the Chinese as its mission. We hope that you will uphold justice and achieve the goal of canceling the increased taxation before it is too late. We hereby send this letter again, hoping for your verification." After receiving the letter, the association has forwarded it to the French Public Works Bureau, requesting a prompt verification and reply to avoid disputes.</p>

<p>丨For Participating in Reactionary Work丨</p>
<p>The supervisors of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau’s Supervision Office learned the other day that a Guangxi woman named Chen Ying, age 22, who resides in the pavilion room of a certain lane and number on Xipushilu Road in the French Concession and previously studied at Jinan University and China Public School, has recently been participating in the Communist Party’s reactionary work and has been appointed as a member of the bogus Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee. She has been active in Shanghai, conducting secret propaganda, and so on. The supervisors immediately reported this to Director Wen Hongen, prepared a document, and went to the political department of the French police station to report and request assistance in arresting and extraditing her for trial. The director of the department approved the request and immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the address, arrest Ms. Chen, and search a large number of communist books and leaflets in the room, bring them back to the police station for detention, and send them to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for trial yesterday afternoon. Judge Guo, along with the Fan and Sun magistrates, jointly opened the Third Criminal Court with Chief Prosecutor Zhao to conduct the trial. Attorney Yao Zhaodi appeared in court on behalf of the police station, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent personnel to the court with a document to request the transfer of the defendant. The court announced that because the case involved politics, public attendance was prohibited. According to the results of the trial, the police station opposed the transfer because the defendant resided in the concession and committed the crime in the concession, which should be under the jurisdiction of the concession court. The prosecutor also expressed agreement. The police station's reason for filing the case was that it was under the jurisdiction of this court for trial. Finally, the court announced that the defendant need not be transferred and would be detained pending a scheduled trial.</p>

<p>A Qín Teacher Suffers Robbery Halfway</p>
<p>The Female Thief's Face Shows Signs of Smoking</p>
<p>Chen Nianzhi, residing at No. 110 Guangxi Road, who is a qín teacher, was accompanied by his friends Geng Dalin and Jin Changsheng at 2:40 a.m. on the 16th of this month, and when they arrived at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Hankou Road, they were suddenly encountered by three robbers, two men and one woman, each wielding a pistol, blocking their way. They were forbidden to make a sound, and Chen's woolen hat, overcoat, and shorts, worth a total of 32 yuan, were robbed and the robbers fled. Chen reported the information to the police station, stating the faces and clothing of each thief, and stating that the female thief had signs of smoking on her face. The police chief, upon receiving the report, ordered Chinese detectives Zhao Fuhai, Cui Chengke, and others to cooperate with Chen Nianzhi and the two witnesses Geng and Jin to go to various public places and tea rooms to secretly investigate. At about 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, they suddenly saw a woman with a face full of smoke coming out of a certain alley in Guangxi Road. After careful observation by the witness, they recognized her as the female thief who was robbing on the spot at the time, so they arrested her along with a suspect, Yan Hongmu from Shaoxing, and took them to the Xinzha Police Station. Upon questioning, the female thief's name was Qian Xuezhen, 23 years old, a local. She was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Special District Court. According to the case stated by Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, Qian Xuezhen was charged with robbery under Article 348 of the Criminal Law, and it was requested that the suspect Yan Hongmu be detained for investigation. In addition, the victim Chen Nianzhi and witnesses Geng Dalin and Jin Changsheng submitted a case to prove the robbery situation and pointed out the face of the defendant Qian Yunzhen. Although her ability to determine was not accurate, her figure, hair, etc. were all very similar to the female thief who was robbing. Upon questioning, Qian Yunzhen refused to admit it. Judge Xue ordered Qian and Hong to be returned to custody separately, and to be re-questioned at a later date after the investigation.</p>

<p>The Real Estate Association Advises Digging Artesian Wells for Relief</p>
<p>After the British-owned Shanghai Water Company closed the main water pipe in Tonghaili, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou the other day, more than two thousand residents were greatly panicked. The other day, the Shanghai Water Company of Huaideli, Qipulu, also sent Chinese and foreign dignitaries to the neighborhood to shut off the water pipes, causing the tenants in the neighborhood to question the owners, Tao Rangji, and the clamor did not stop. The owners of the neighborhood went to the Real Estate Association yesterday, asking it to forward the request to the Public Works Department, ordering the Water Company to open the water immediately to resume drinking water. The neighborhood immediately forwarded the request to the Public Works Department for investigation.</p>
<p>Tao Rangji's Letter Tao Rangji sent a letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, the Shanghai Water Company's water bills for our property at No. 3 to No. 19, Lane 384, Huaideli, Qipulu have not been issued for four months. We do not know the water price and they have not come to collect the bills. This morning, the company suddenly closed the water meter, and the tenants came to question us one after another, and the clamor did not stop. According to this situation, the company is unknowingly making a mistake by cutting off drinking water, which violates people's livelihood and concerns people's lives. When we reasoned with them, the Chinese and foreign personnel evaded us in every possible way. We hereby send this letter to your association, asking it to forward it to the Public Works Department and quickly order the Water Company to open the water immediately to resume the lives of the people. Respectfully, to the Real Estate Association."</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Department (1) Dear Sir, according to a letter from our association member Ji Ji (see above), they came to the association, and we should send a letter to your bureau for strict investigation, so as to give importance to people's lives. Respectfully, to the Director-General of the Public Concession Public Works Department. (2) Dear Sir, according to a letter from our association member Kaigeng Ji Renting Accounting House, the Shanghai Water Company often forces the landlord to pay the water bill for his identity, otherwise they will cut off the water and not allow him to use it. However, we have found that the tenants owe rent for two or three months. The landlord has not received the rent, so how can he advance the water bill? This kind of coercion is beyond reason. We hope that your association will find a way to deal with this. Respectfully, to the Director-General of the Public Concession Public Works Department. (3) Dear Sir, according to a letter from our association member, the Real Estate Department of Shanghai China Reclamation Bank (see previous report), Shanghai Water Company still intends to illegally cut off water, putting users to death, even though the water fee committee has been established, which shows that they are completely insincere and extremely rude. According to the situation in the letter, we should send a letter to your bureau immediately, ordering the company to open the water in order to maintain people's lives and avoid embarrassing the justice authorities. Respectfully, to the Director-General of the Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Reply to the Reclamation Bank The Real Estate Association replied to the Real Estate Department of the Reclamation Bank yesterday, saying: "Dear Sir, we have respectfully received your letter of December 19 regarding the illegal water outage by the Shanghai Water Company and know everything. In addition to going to the Public Concession Public Works Department to order the Water Company to open the water and wait for a solution, we are corresponding to inform you and hope that you will immediately drill an artesian well to seek a permanent solution and reduce the living burden of users. Respectfully, to the Real Estate Department of the Reclamation Bank."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Sandalwood and Dried Longan Trade Association, in opposition to the illegal food donation levied by the Public Concession Municipal Council, requests assistance from all sectors and issued a special circular yesterday, which states: "To Whom It May Concern, Our members, Rongchun and thirteen other firms, jointly wrote a letter stating that our firms are located on Fujian Road.  The oldest of our businesses has been established for over fifty years, and the others for more than ten years (with account books and house tax receipts as proof). We have never heard of any precedent where businesses like ours, selling dried goods, are required to donate for and obtain a license as with cooked food stores. However, in November of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) and July of the 21st year (1932), the Public Concession Municipal Council Health Department attempted to levy food donations from our firms. On both occasions, the Chinese Ratepayers Association reasoned with them and the court upheld justice, thus exempting us. There is an old case on file to prove this. According to the ruling by Judge Shen of the Violation Court of the First Special District Court on November 25, 1927, the Public Concession's claim that Rongchun, Yongchun, and other firms violated regulations does not apply to Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations. If the Council wishes to require these firms to obtain a license, it must revise the Yangjingbang Regulations. Judge Shen upheld justice and protected the rights of Chinese merchants, a deed worthy of praise. It is noted that the Municipal Council has repeatedly brought frivolous lawsuits over the past six years, resulting in dozens of court hearings. Our firms have repeatedly resisted and denied the donations. Our indomitable spirit and diligent struggle, fearing that it would affect the rights and future of the nation and all Chinese merchants in the concession, is not insignificant. The amount involved for our industry is extremely small, costing each firm no more than a few yuan per season. This year, the Municipal Council Health Department has once again sued our firms in the First Special District Court, claiming that we opened food stores on Fujian Road on April 10, June 23, July 28, and November 30 without obtaining a license from the Health Department, which is inconsistent with the facts. The items sold by our firms are mostly sandalwood and dried longan, dried fruits, such as walnuts, lychees, and lotus seeds, which are harmless to health. Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations clearly states that tea houses, restaurants, dance halls, and story houses must obtain licenses, namely the Municipal Council's Chinese Food Sales Shop License, which is interpreted as applying to all sales of fresh fish, fresh meat, poultry, vegetables, and "hot food stores." From this, it is clear that our firms are fundamentally not "hot food stores" or "food stores." The so-called "cooked food stores" refer to places where customers eat on the premises, not those who buy food to take away, which is based on the English interpretation (Eating house). 'Eating' means 'eating,' and 'Eating house' means eating at the food store. Therefore, the goods sold by our firms are fundamentally different from 'food stores' and 'cooked food stores.' The Health Department's accusation of violation has no basis. Such harsh donations disturb businesses and are an illegal oppression. It is difficult to accept, especially during this time of commercial depression. How can we tolerate their extortion, arbitrary slaughter, and endless demands? If we do not unite and fight for our rights, we small merchants will face extinction. Moreover, on the 15th of this month, Judge Deng of the First Special District Court, without carefully examining the provisions of Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, hastily ordered a fine of ten yuan and demanded back payments, which is a contempt for merchants and an arbitrary penalty. We are unwilling to accept this. Therefore, we have retained lawyers Shao Shengzu and Tang Tiantao to formally petition the court for a trial, and we have issued a special letter to your association requesting permission to expand publicity and requesting assistance from all sectors to achieve the goal of abolishing this harsh donation. Upon consideration of the above, the facts are indeed true. We hereby request all sectors and organizations to show patriotic enthusiasm and provide assistance to strive together to achieve the goal of abolishing this harsh donation, to maintain a lifeline for Chinese merchants. We would be extremely grateful."</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, a fire broke out due to carelessness at the home of Madam Jiang Wu, residing at No. 2, 99th Street, Xujiahui Town, west of Shanghai. It spread to seven neighboring houses, burning down nine houses and causing significant losses. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Xu Lianke, head of the Lawa District Security Corps, has lived for generations at No. 2, 99th Street, Xujiahui West Town. The house has five bays, with front and rear buildings and four side rooms, and is an old-style bungalow. Xu has four brothers: the eldest, Lianjia, lives in the eastern section of the front building; the second is Lianke, who lives in the eastern section of the rear building; the third brother is deceased; and there is a sister-in-law, Xu Lu, who lives in the western section of the rear building. The fourth, Lianji, lives in the western section of the front building and has already moved out. Xu Lu has one son and one daughter. Her son, named Fugen, is twelve years old and currently studying. Her daughter, named Zixin, is twenty-two years old. The mother and daughter both work as factory workers at the Great China Overshoe Factory. The remaining two rooms in the west side room are rented to two tenant families from Nanqiao, Jiang Hongchun and Hu Yunting. Yesterday morning, around 7:00 AM, Xu Lu and her daughter went to work at the factory, leaving only Jiang Wu, the wife of tenant Jiang Hongchun, at home. Around 9:30 AM, Wu was careless while cooking, and the remaining firewood in front of the stove caught fire instantly. By the time Xu Lu heard about it and returned home, the fire had already broken through the roof. Unfortunately, the fire was raging, and it was impossible to control it. Although firefighters from various fire brigades and the chiefs and police officers of the Second Sub-Bureau of the Sixth District arrived to put out the fire, there was no tap water installation in the area, and the river behind was blocked with silt, making the efforts futile. The fire was finally extinguished at 11:15 AM.</p>

Recently, her brother, Gong Wenquan, and her fiancé, Wang Yunqi, acting as legal representatives, together with lawyer Lu Qi, filed a complaint with the First Special District Court against Fei Guizhen, a classmate and fellow villager of Wenjuan, You Yuesheng, and Liu Changguo, the owner of the Changfu Class brothel in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, alleging that they conspired to seduce a girl under the age of twenty, sold her into prostitution, and intended to profit from it. The Special Court has held two hearings on the case, but the three defendants have not been summoned, making it difficult to proceed. Yesterday afternoon, another hearing was scheduled. Of the defendants, only Fei Guizhen was supposed to appear in court. The plaintiffs, Gong Wenquan and Wang Yunqi, were unable to attend due to illness and were represented by their lawyer, Lu Qi, who stated the details of the lawsuit, saying that Wenjuan, the younger sister of the plaintiff Gong Wenquan and the fiancée of Wang Yunqi, is currently nineteen years old.

On Dragon Boat Festival this year, Wenjuan was invited by her female classmate, Fei Guizhen (who lives at No. 740 Gaolang Bridge, Lan Road, and is currently a factory worker at the British American Tobacco Company), to come to Shanghai for a wedding feast. At Fei's home, she met You Yuesheng, Fei Guizhen's lover, who introduced himself and tried hard to win her over. You then used all his powers of seduction. Wenjuan was young and was seduced. You and Fei then led her to amusement parks such as Yong'an and the Great World. She was then deceived and taken to a room on the fifth floor of the Great China Hotel, where one man and two women shared a bed and had sexual relations for three nights. Fei and You saw that Wenjuan was young and could be deceived, and they were blinded by greed, so they devised a plan to sell her. Fearing that things would go wrong nearby, they falsely claimed</p>

<p>You boarded the Shanghai-Beijing train with Wenjuan, while Fei made a pretext to return halfway. You then induced Wenjuan to go from Shanghai to Nanjing, then to Tianjin, where they hid in the Garden Hotel in the Japanese Concession. Soon after, You suddenly claimed that he did not have enough money for travel and wanted to traffic morphine to earn a large sum of money, but he lacked capital. If he borrowed from friends nearby, he was afraid that old friends would not trust him because they had not seen him for a long time. He said, "We must falsely claim to be a couple and temporarily pawn Wenjuan, pretending to wait for money from Shanghai to be remitted to Tianjin." Wenjuan was young and inexperienced and believed him. Therefore, she accompanied You to the home of the third defendant, Liu Changguo. Liu welcomed them warmly and treated them hospitably, without any suspicion. That evening, Liu suddenly said, "The guest rooms here are not very comfortable. I'm afraid they will be uncomfortable for guests from afar." He then summoned a maid to take Wenjuan to his concubine's residence in a rickshaw.

Moreover, she was constrained by the unfamiliar dialect. Although she suspected something was wrong, she did not dare to ask. When it was nearly dusk, Wenjuan saw that the situation was increasingly unfavorable. She wanted to take the opportunity to run away, but she was stopped by a strong pimp who blocked her with his arms and scolded her. The pimps retorted, and she learned that You Yuesheng had received 700 yuan and had sold her to Liu to become a prostitute (Liu was the head of the Changfu Class brothel).  She was in a hellish situation.  She repeatedly tried to break out of the door, but was prevented each time.  She screamed and cried for help, but she was in a foreign land, and who could help her?

However, he was unfamiliar with the area and had limited resources, so he immediately reported it to his wife's family and pleaded with the local Women and Children Relief Society for assistance. The society then prepared a document and consulted with the Tianjin branch, trying to have Wenjuan summoned to the Chinese Concession to report the case to the police, who would then send her to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau for detention for a long time. However, Liu had connections everywhere and not only was not moved but even intended to get her released. Fortunately, the Tianjin branch fought for justice and hired a lawyer to apply to the court in charge to have Wenjuan transferred to the court for questioning.  It was ordered that the plaintiff, Wenquan, should take her back.  The Tianjin branch then helped Wenjuan to the branch and sent personnel</p>

However, because the Changfu Class was located in the Japanese Concession, and Liu Changguo had considerable influence in the area, it was not easy to get them to comply.  A new plan had to be devised.  The Tianjin branch then assigned two people, carrying Wenjuan's photograph and disguised as customers, to go to the Changfu Class brothel to solicit prostitutes, specifying that they needed someone from the south.

<p>The Overview and Future Development Plan of the China National Aviation Corporation in 1933 by Dai Enji</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation, a joint venture between China and the United States, has been operating for over three years. With the guidance of the government, the support of people from all walks of life, and the efforts of the company's colleagues, the past achievements have been praised by the public. At the beginning of this year, Enji was ordered to take charge of the company. I worked day and night, not daring to slack off, and I was particularly dedicated to the work of the three major routes. The Shanghai-Beiping route was opened on January 10 this year, the Chongqing-Chengdu route was opened on November 11 this year, and the Shanghai-Guangdong route was opened on October 24 this year. From then on, the north, south, east, and west are connected, which is convenient for Chinese and foreign people. The Chongqing-Chengdu route is particularly convenient. In the past, it took ten days to travel between Chengdu and Chongqing by both land and water. Since November 11 this year, the plane can travel more than a thousand miles in two hours, and there is no longer the feeling of the difficulty of the Shu Road.</p>
<p>The company, in view of the prosperity of commerce and the development of passenger and mail services between Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, and Chengdu, plans to use the latest type of aircraft for flights in the summer of next year. This type of aircraft is stable and comfortable, and its cruising speed is 150 miles (about 450 li), which is one-third faster than the current aircraft. In this way, it can leave Shanghai in the morning and arrive in Hankou at noon, and all mail can be delivered in the afternoon. Leaving Hankou the next morning, it can also arrive in Chengdu at noon on the same day. Therefore, the journey between Shanghai and Chengdu is only two days, and the journey in the air is only ten hours.</p>
<p>The history and achievements of the China National Aviation Corporation have long been known to the public. It is praised as a giant of commercial aviation in our country. All future plans will be realized as scheduled. The following is a list of statistics from January to the end of November 1933:</p>
<p>Number of passengers carried from January to the end of November 1933: 2,349</p>
<p>Passenger miles accumulated from January to the end of November 1933: 819,693</p>
<p>Mail carried from January to the end of November 1933 (in kilograms): 40,767</p>
<p>Flight miles from January to the end of November 1933: 571,912</p>
<p>From the above observations, our country's commercial aviation has a potential for rapid development in the future. For the needs of rapid development, the China National Aviation Corporation must train talents as a necessary plan. All kinds of equipment needed for development must be urgently worked on, so as not to become a deformed development. Therefore, new types of manufacturing are also pursued within the possible range to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>When the company first started, it hired many foreign personnel. Now, our country's personnel are competent. For example, the radio department is entirely composed of our country's personnel. Our country's personnel are also responsible for dismantling and repairing aircraft, and the effect is remarkable. The existence period of the Sino-American contract is only ten years, and it has been three and a half years. The time of six and a half years will arrive in a blink of an eye. Therefore, the cultivation of talents cannot be delayed, because it will be used in the future. The equipment of Longhua Airport has gradually changed. It was originally planned to build two runways for the takeoff and landing of aircraft. One of them has already been completed. Our country's airfield has never had a runway before. This is actually a pioneer. The second one has also started construction and should be completed by the end of this year. A new shed will be built next spring to make it complete. When it first opened, some passengers may have imagined the simplicity of the airport. Comparing the past and the present, it is no different from heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, currently, China National Aviation Corporation only has domestic flights and only carries domestic mail. It is expected that it will soon be able to carry international mail as well. This is what the company is looking forward to day and night.</p>

<p>▲ Flying Colors Heavily Defeats Junior League</p>
<p>Last night's Western Youth basketball Group A match saw the Pirates defeat St. John's by a score of 45-15. The game was leisurely, with little excitement. In the Group B match, Flying Colors defeated Junior League. The strength of the two teams was vastly different, with a huge score difference. The result was 98-17, which can be said to be unprecedented. In the final match, Western Youth played against Rowing. At halftime, Rowing was winning 16-7. In the afternoon, Western Youth rallied and managed to reverse the victory with a score of 28-25.</p>
<p>▲ Flying Colors Overwhelms Junior League: Flying Colors against Junior League was like an eagle catching a chick, completely defenseless. Flying Colors' teamwork was excellent, and their forwards made every shot. The weakness of the opponents was evident. The game resulted in more turnovers than actual plays, resulting in a final score of 98-17.</p>

<p>▲ St. John's Cannot Defeat Pirates: The game between St. John's and the Pirates also became a one-sided affair. The Pirates' center, Ryan, was as tall as a giant, making it difficult for St. John's to defend. In addition, with Smith in the front and Piling in the back, St. John's was completely helpless in the first half. Although St. John's launched a fierce attack in the second half, they were ultimately defeated due to insufficient strength. The final score was 45-15.</p>

<p>▲ Special Price Until the End of This Month</p>
<p>The "Diligence Sports Monthly," an unprecedented and unique periodical in the sports world, is published by the Diligence Bookstore at 392 Rue Labourdonnais, Shanghai. The monthly is edited by sports experts Shao Rugan and Ruan Weicun, and the contributors to each issue are all famous sports figures and experts from around the country. Therefore, the content is rich, with both illustrations and text. Every issue provides accurate descriptions and explorations of sports theory, administration, training, technology, and teaching materials. The inclusion of dance and games is even more valuable. Hao Gengsheng, a sports inspector from the Ministry of Education, has greatly praised it. Its value can be seen from this. The first issue, the "Inaugural Issue," and the second issue, the "National Games Special Issue," have been reprinted and are about to be sold out. The third issue, the "Primary School Sports Special Issue," has already been published, and the fourth issue is currently being compiled. Recently, subscriptions to the monthly have been coming in one after another, with remittances for subscriptions from as far away as Southeast Asia, Japan, Europe, and the United States. It is popular both domestically and internationally and is truly an honor for domestic periodicals. It is heard that the bookstore, in order to thoroughly promote new sports, still adheres to the principle of sacrifice, with each issue priced at two jiao. Those who subscribe for the whole year within the year can still enjoy a subscription fee of one yuan and two jiao (discounted price until the end of December). Domestic postage is free, and overseas postage is an additional one yuan and eight jiao. However, this is only applicable to direct subscriptions to the bookstore's publishing office and retail department at 554 Fourth Malu. All sports students, sports enthusiasts, and primary and secondary school physical education teachers should definitely subscribe for reference to improve themselves.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Anti-Semitism <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yuesheng</p>
<p>The year 1933 is nearing its end. Among the major events discovered in the world this year, anti-Semitism is undoubtedly one of them.</p>
<p>Japan no longer massacres Koreans, Britain seems much more polite to India, and France has never killed many Annamese. Although they have all lost their countries, their fate is not so bad after all!</p>
<p>The unlucky ones are the overseas Chinese! Driven from the east and expelled from the west, their situation is truly miserable! Next are the Jews!</p>
<p>The Jewish people and the Chinese can be said to be ancient nations of equal standing. The difference is that the Jewish nation was destroyed long ago, while China is still barely surviving!</p>
<p>However, the status of the Chinese in the world seems to be inferior to that of the already extinct Jewish people. The latter has indeed made considerable contributions to the world, and their national unity is also strong, especially their talent for becoming wealthy. These qualities seem to be unmatched by any other nation. If China and the Jewish people were to exchange places, the question of whether the Chinese nation would still exist in the world today would be a real one!</p>
<p>The biggest reason why the German National Socialist government adopted a policy of excluding "Aryan" people and making things difficult for Jews is that they believe the power of the Jews is enough to hinder Germany's survival. In other words, it is nothing more than envy in a broad sense! Of course, the Jews are unwilling to submit to this. The world-renowned German scientist Albert Einstein, therefore, declared his departure from German nationality and became a British subject. They also held national conferences and passed resolutions to boycott German goods and request the League of Nations to sponsor Jewish immigration to Palestine and other places. They also shouted slogans of striving hard and not giving up until death. But the fact remains that Europe does not allow them to establish a foothold. Although we say that we have not tasted the bitterness of national subjugation, the "precedent" of the Jews is not far off, and it should be enough to be alarming!</p>
<p>Since the Jews cannot live in peace in Germany, they are also being squeezed out by the tide of unemployment in Europe. They are unwilling to die just like that, and they are eagerly seeking a livelihood, but where can they go!</p>
<p>So they flood into China like a tide!</p>
<p>China is indeed a good place to go! It is a colony of various powers and a haven for exiles from all countries! Exploitation upon exploitation, parasitism upon parasitism. If someone were to ask me where the Chinese people plan to go in the future? Then this question should also be alarming! Where will we go in the future!</p>
<h3 id="e249">The Nose Expert Who Makes Money with His Nose <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>A person with vast wealth but no skills may not be able to eat endlessly forever; a person with a skill but no inheritance may not be forever hungry and cold. A "skill" is a "talent," and with a "talent," one can make money; with money, one can buy food. Those who use their minds earn money by thinking, and thinking is their "talent"; those who use their physical strength earn money by working, and working is their "talent." Whether one uses their mind or physical strength, whether one thinks or works, being able to earn money to make a living is all good.</p>
<p>It can be said that ordinary people in society who earn a living generally cannot escape the scope of using their minds or physical strength. Recently, there was a news story saying that besides using the mind and physical strength, there is now another way to make money: with the nose. In a spice and perfume factory in England, there is a special nose that is worth 20,000 yuan a year. It turns out that there is a chemist in the factory who has special training and research in smell, called the "smell expert." He can get several times more salary than others just by using his nose. So a good nose is very valuable; but its sense of smell must be extremely sharp from the beginning. It can almost discern the situation with just one sniff. It is probably not easy to train to this level.</p>
<p>Mixing various perfumes or blending various spices is an art. In the ingredients of any special perfume that is painstakingly and carefully made, adding even the smallest drop, too much or too little, is enough to ruin everything. In this case, one must consult the "smell expert." His nose takes a sniff and can immediately tell him whether the perfume is mixed correctly or not. If it is not mixed correctly, he can also smell out what should be added. There is also a "smell expert" who makes money with his nose who is hired by a group of old managers of breweries to check the old empty barrels that are sent back to the brewery. He can use his special nose and keen sense of smell to tell which empty barrel is safe to fill with new beer again; and which empty barrel will cause the new beer to spoil if filled again. In addition to checking barrels, the sense of smell also plays an important role in distinguishing the quality of wine.</p>

<p>(1) Rebirth</p>
<p>The rhythm of the machine, the rendering of torches, and snake-like women weave together a picture of urban licentiousness. I passively followed the crowd, drawn into the red vortex. However, mental stimulation, in the aversion to painful memories, made me resolutely run to the countryside.</p>
<p>Having left the pink city, I have been staying in the quiet New Longhua for three months. There, breathing fresh air and coming into contact with a serene environment, this tranquil and simple life has tightly gripped my heart, which is disgusted with the city.</p>
<p>Indeed, rural life is filled with the vitality of youth. Although the rural economy has fallen to the point of collapse, this heavy grayness cannot obscure the active vigor. The beautiful smiles of healthy village girls and the sincere rustic tales of old farmers are all poetic scenes, the beauty of life!</p>
<p>This poetic rebirth, may you forever bind my weary soul!</p>
<p>(2) Lingering Autumn</p>
<p>The deep autumn wind reddened the maple leaves in front of the pavilion and brought the chill of early winter. Autumn is waning!</p>
<p>The sky is piled with large chunks of clouds, gray and heavy clouds, as if pressing on people's shoulders. In the fields, the withered yellow mulberry leaves and haggard rice stalks fully display the listlessness after being exploited by the landlords. Leafless branches sway in the wind, and withered leaves fall into the autumn stream. A lost lamb, in the quiet and desolate air, calls out to its dear mother. A lone goose, singing a sad tune, is searching for its final resting place.</p>
<p>This lingering autumn scene entered my eyes and resonated in my ears. My heart is stirred by an uneasy feeling, a bleak mood, and a melancholy thought.</p>
<p>"Autumn" is a season of sorrow. "Lingering Autumn" reveals the sadness of withering. All declining phenomena suggest the ruthlessness of "autumn." It generally makes people feel sad and despondent.</p>
<p>The deep autumn wind reddened the maple leaves in front of the pavilion and brought the chill of early winter. Autumn is disappearing on the heartstrings of sorrow.</p>

<p>Ms. Jiang saw that he lowered his head and walked into the courtyard step by step, pushed the door open, stepped in with one foot, and still turned his head to look behind, with a hesitant expression. Ms. Jiang said: Who's outside? Chai Zhi said: No one. As he spoke, he walked in, first sighed silently, and then slowly sat down in the chair. Ms. Jiang's two eyebrows were tightly furrowed, almost forming a line. She thought to herself that when he went out just now, he was happy and excited, how come he came back with such a bitter face again? So, she put on an ignorant look and smiled at him: Is there any extra material? Gui Zhi said: No extra. He sat sideways, slightly raising his head to look at the sky outside the window. Ms. Jiang said: Did that tailor Wang say something to you? Gui Zhi still looked at the sky and did not say anything. Ms. Jiang said: I see you look a little unhappy, did tailor Wang say something to offend you? Gui Zhi suddenly twisted his body and said: Ugh! Why are you so nagging? We are taking him business as a tailor, that's looking up to him, why would he offend me if I didn't say anything strange? Ms. Jiang originally thought that because he looked angry, she wanted to ask him a few questions and then comfort him. Unexpectedly, the more she asked, the worse it got, and he became angry instead. She originally wanted to continue asking, but when she wanted to continue asking, she was afraid that he would become even more angry, so she just smiled at the girl and went to the inner room, no longer asking about the girl's affairs. But Gui Zhi himself did not relieve his distress because his mother did not pay attention to him. He thought to himself that in these few months, he had not received a letter from Gan Zhi. I thought he had forgotten me. But judging from his inquiries about me to the old woman, it is clear that he still pays attention to me. I am now a woman with a husband, and I am about to get married. I really don't want to see him sick and cause me a lot of trouble. (274)</p>

<h3 id="e255">Birds and Insects <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yu</p>
<p>During this season of falling leaves, the so-called paradise of Suzhou, birds and insects, are once again on the market to provide a pastime for the general leisure class. I have written down the general situation of this bird and insect life, which can also be regarded as a kind of Suzhou local customs note.</p>
<p>▲ Birds In spring, birds sing, and birds are originally animals that adorn the spring; orioles across the leaves and swallows through the flowers have long been praised and admired by poets, who consider them to be wonderful animals with poetic beauty. However, the birds on the market these days do not rely on their charming warbles to win people's appreciation. They rely on their agile flight and flexible feeding. When the food is thrown upwards by the bird players, the birds flap their wings and fly away, catching the food in the air, to win the joy of the bird players. There are about three types of birds that eat flying food, which are written below:</p>
<p>Baotou: This bird is about the size of a small crow, with soft light gray feathers all over its body and a wide yellow beak. Its flying power is the strongest among birds that eat flying food. The food of the Baotou is raw watermelon seeds. A well-trained bird can fly in the air non-stop to catch food and never tire. It is very beautiful to see it rising and falling like a rabbit and falcon.</p>
<p>Mala, its body is about the size of a chick, and its feathers are yellow and black, mottled and beautiful. It is a bird that eats millet. Although its flying power is not as durable as the Baotou, its colored feathers reflected in the clear sky are very dazzling when flying in the air.</p>
<p>Yellow Finch, the shape of the yellow finch is similar to that of a sparrow, but the light yellow and black feathers are much more beautiful than sparrows. It can not only fly and catch food, but also sing crisp songs in a bird cage to win people's joy. The food of the yellow finch is the dried seeds of perilla in medicine. It is flexible, but its flying power is relatively weak.</p>
<p>Among the three types of birds, Baotou is the most expensive and yellow finch is the cheapest. The method of training flying birds is to first starve the bird to be trained. When it is extremely hungry, tie a thin rope around the bird's neck and lure it to fly over to eat. When it approaches, throw the food into the air. Because it is hungry, it cannot help but flap its wings and fly away, opening its mouth to welcome the food. By training it slowly in this way, the bird's eyesight and skills gradually become skilled. When it is trained to perfection, it will habitually obey and listen to people's teasing. However, because these birds are excessively tortured, most of them cannot survive the winter. As the saying goes, "birds die for food," which is indeed a true saying.</p>
<p>▲ Insects Although many insects that chirp in autumn have fallen silent like cicadas in this season of withered grass and fallen leaves, the chirping crickets are flapping their wings and baring their fangs, displaying their mighty general power. The place where crickets are fought is called the "cricket shed." It is said that the amount of money won or lost in cricket fighting is quite large. The custom of cricket fighting was the pastime of Jia Sidao, the Taiping Prime Minister of the Song Dynasty, in the Hule Garden. But because the prime minister was a great man of the times, he called out loudly, and those below followed suit, which became a special kind of gambling among the people. The article "Cricket" recorded in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" can give a glimpse of the situation of cricket fighting in the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>There are also several rules for the method of fighting crickets: First, the weight of the cricket must be weighed on a scale, and it must be equal in weight before the fight can begin. However, there are also crickets that differ in weight, then the larger side must be allowed to give in a little, but this is rare. Second, is the betting method. The kind of money bet in the cricket arena is called flowers. In the past, the price of one flower was about one corner of the ocean, but now the most common flower costs half a yuan or one yuan per bet. The money bet on cricket fighting increases as the winter deepens, with as much as three or four thousand yuan per game. As for the method of fighting crickets, first put the crickets of both sides into a specially prepared battle fence. The shape and size of the fence is similar to a piano on a table, divided into two compartments, each with bamboo supports running through it, loosely barred. After the crickets arrive in the cage, they rest slightly, and then the person in charge of the fight removes the partition in the middle, so that the crickets on both sides fight each other. At that time, the crickets, due to the instigation of the fighter, will not hesitate to kill each other. After the first victory or defeat is decided, the defeated cricket is assigned to the resting compartment, covered with a wet towel on the fence to allow it to regain its spirit and try a second fight. If the loser in the second fight can turn defeat into victory, then it must rest again and make a third fight to determine the final victory, otherwise, after two fights, the victory or defeat of both sides is determined.</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The historian Van Loon, in explaining the French Revolution, said: "Regarding the French Revolution, whether you read a novel, watch a play, or a movie, it is very easy to get the impression that the revolution was created by thugs in the slums of Paris. In reality, this is not the case at all. ... Some happy but careless people use firecrackers as a game until the sparks fall down and pass through the cracks in the floor (this floor, like the rest of the building, is already old and rotten), and unfortunately fall on the bottom layer, where there are many years of old waste mixed together. Afterwards, everyone shouted loudly that there was a fire. But the owner of this house pays attention to nothing but managing his property and does not know how to put out the flames. The flames quickly spread and burned the entire building. We call this flame the French Revolution." This passage can be used as the best annotation for the idiom "people's hearts think of chaos." There is also a famous British figure, Chesterfield, who said twenty-five years before the French Revolution (1763): "All the phenomena that occurred before the great revolution and great chaos that I have seen in history are now present in France and are increasing day by day." "Everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking" is a more direct annotation of "people's hearts think of chaos."</p>
<p>When society is infected with a critical illness, "concealment" and "anesthesia" will never be effective. The first thing to do is to ask a doctor to carefully diagnose, prescribe medicine; the illusion that a magical talisman can cure the disease should be woken up from. The destruction of political power in Chinese history generally takes two forms: one is that the peasants who have reached the end of their rope gather together and burn down the old palaces like wildfire; the other is that foreign nations, like floods, completely destroy the old dikes. "People's hearts think of chaos" is certainly a social abnormality. Upon careful consideration, can we deny this abnormality? Enduring hardship and humiliation, like the peasants of China, can be said to be extreme; but there must always be a path for them to take. If the peasants have no path to take, and they believe that the "True Son of Heaven" is about to be born, then there is nothing to do! Moreover, if a nation does not have the courage to compete for survival and always plans to be content with the present, even if people's hearts do not think of chaos, what can be done!</p>
<p>China's chaos has been going on for a long time, and we should quickly find ways to eliminate the hearts of the people who think of chaos.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Secret Revealed <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Fu</p>
<p>I don't know where the greatest amusement park in China is? But some people say it is "The Great World." The Great World often makes contributions to society. What was the greatest contribution of 1933? It is said to be the big mooncake that cannot be eaten made during the Mid-Autumn Festival and this "secret revealed."</p>
<p>The "secret" that was "revealed" this time is "two strange people": "one with three feet" and "one with a tail." They just happened to be two brothers, born so "odd." Perhaps because they are a bit extraordinary, it is said that they have always been "strictly secretive." Although it once caused a sensation throughout Shandong Province, they never deigned to satisfy the eyes of their fellow villagers and lightly expose "that extra thing." However, strange people are always soft-hearted. This time, after "the world's persuaders repeatedly requested," they could not refuse and had to "reluctantly" satisfy the eyes of Shanghai's young masters and ladies.</p>
<p>However, this is what the advertisement says.</p>
<p>The advertisement also found a pair of portraits, with the caption: "No imitation," much like the scissors of "Genuine Wang Mazi." I don't pay attention to these things. I think that even if there is "no imitation," it is just a kind of physiological abnormality, a kind of "superfluous" disease. Not worth appreciating. What I regret is that "their" "secret" is not two big ears hanging down to the shoulders, but a pig's tail, which cannot inspire respect.</p>
<p>In addition, I also thought about the meaning of the word "reveal."</p>
<p>According to the advertisement, the "reveal" of this "secret" is passive, and I very much believe it. The reason is very obvious: "Who would want to show their tail?" The reason why they had no choice was for money. People with money can naturally "treasure" their tail and "reveal" other people's to have fun, and they also have to recognize this "tail" as a spectacle!</p>
<p>The painter's model, the one who "reveals" her "secret" is the painter. In China, the models are all poor girls. Naturally, it is also passive. Ladies with money are unwilling to do this business.</p>
<p>Also, a robber commits a crime, and this crime is naturally a "secret." The stolen owner and the robber have to stand in two different positions. The former wants to "reveal" this "secret," while the latter wants to keep it a secret. But there are also those who, because they cannot stand the master's beating, "reveal" this "secret" in a flurry of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Therefore, people who "reveal" "secrets" must be powerful people, and those who are revealed are naturally the weak.</p>
<p>Then, is the "secret" so mysterious? Not necessarily. There are many in history who willingly "reveal secrets" to gain the laughter of their masters. In old dramas, there is a trick of "presenting a map," which is a traitor revealing the "secret" of his country's territory to the enemy. This is naturally not out of "being unable to refuse" and the pain of physical torture, because at that time the enemy had not yet penetrated deeply and the outcome of the battle had not yet been determined. But it is also not out of economic oppression, because the person who "presents a map" cannot be a small commoner, but must be at least a senior official, and senior officials all have money. So, what are they doing it for? I think there is no need for us to answer this! However, we must know that what they reveal is not a personal secret, and there is nothing as shameful as taking off their pants and showing their tail. What they reveal is the public; and it is also the public who suffer. Moreover, all of this is done in the dark, and you can't even see their own tail, only hearing sweet words and tears like springs, this is the real secret! Who will "reveal" this "secret"?</p>
<h3 id="e258">Chaliapin and Gorky <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, after reading Mr. Shi Zhecun's "Chaliapin in the Revolutionary Era," I couldn't help but have a few small thoughts.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi seems very worried about Chaliapin. If the concern is that the "Don Quixote," starring this world-renowned Russian singer, will not be understood or welcomed by the Shanghai audience, then that is indeed something to worry about. Wasn't this film only shown at the Nanjing Grand Theatre for four days, and wasn't it said that it didn't sell as well as the "New Woman" that followed it?</p>
<p>But what Mr. Shi is worried about is about Chaliapin as a person, as if he is easily misunderstood because some people, when criticizing this film, said that Chaliapin was once very famous in the Russian aristocratic theater. And Mr. Shi feels that the meaning of this sentence can easily suggest to readers that Chaliapin is a singer who served the aristocracy.</p>
<p>Is Chaliapin really such a singer? Mr. Shi says no, because Chaliapin, in Mr. Shi's words, is an artist who "not only was for the aristocracy, but also for the common people," and "should be said to be for humanity."</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I once saw an article in a magazine that was also about Chaliapin, titled "Chaliapin: Mask and Man"; and the main point of this article is exactly the opposite of Mr. Shi's, mainly exposing how Chaliapin is a base, greedy, deceptive singer who serves the aristocracy.</p>
<p>In fact, Chaliapin's current life, owning millions of wealth and living comfortably in a luxurious Parisian villa with the nobles and priests of St. Petersburg, isn't that the most eloquent explanation of whether Chaliapin is a singer who serves the aristocracy?</p>
<p>True, Chaliapin, like Gorky, went through a poor, oppressed, and wandering life. He also sympathized with poor young students and lived in his homeland for some time after the October Revolution, performing in workers' theaters. But these do not prevent Chaliapin from being a His Majesty's Solist, a singer who serves the aristocracy, because his true sympathy was on the side of the Tsarist aristocracy. He gave the Tsar, princes, generals, and even the theater director the greatest flattery. He received a gold watch from the Tsar and once even knelt on stage publicly to the Tsar, who had come to watch the play, although he only admitted to kneeling on one knee. This incident aroused indignation among some of his friends, or even broke off relations with him. Plekhanov returned the photo that Chaliapin had given him because of this, writing on it: "Returned because it is useless." Even the more docile artist Serov wrote to him, saying: "What a pity, even you finally crawled on the ground, you should be ashamed!" In order to express a little apology to his friends, Chaliapin once feigned refusal to attend the tercentenary banquet of the Romanov Dynasty.</p>
<p>After the revolution, the reason why Chaliapin was willing to associate with the workers, and even did not hesitate to praise the emerging forces, was only for the security and safety of his own life. The workers honestly believed that Chaliapin was their artist, willing to save on food and clothing to supply the insatiable needs of this artist. But they were deceived. Chaliapin finally came up with a clever excuse and slipped away from his homeland, returning forever to the arms of the aristocracy he served.</p>
<p>Even so, there was a deep friendship between this generation of singers who served the aristocracy, Chaliapin, and the great writer Gorky. Chaliapin still praises Gorky to the highest degree, thanking Gorky for the help and noble artistic influence he gave him. As for their initial acquaintance and their childhood friendship, Mr. Shi has given a brief introduction, and I won't go into detail here. I will only talk about how these two great artists, who came from the same background, took different paths, and how their friendship presented an inevitable crack.</p>
<p>On January 9, 1905, when the streets of St. Petersburg were filled with corpses and overflowing with human blood, to see how these two artists reacted to this incident, one only needs to look at the following words that Chaliapin said in his book "Mask and Man," published in Paris in 1932:</p>
<p>"He (referring to Gorky) was pale and agitated.</p>
<p>'They are slaughtering innocent people, those villains!'</p>
<p>Although I was still singing at a noble's banquet that night, I felt that the truth was on Gorky's side."</p>
<p>The truth was on Gorky's side, but this did not stop him from singing at the nobles' banquets! And maybe he sang very well too!</p>
<p>After the "truth" was finally proved to be "on Gorky's side," Chaliapin ran to a foreign country, which made Gorky angry. He once wrote a letter to Chaliapin, persuading him to return. Regarding this matter, Chaliapin wrote in the same book:</p>
<p>"Later, when I went to Rome, Alexei Maximovich [Gorky's name] said to me again, telling me that I must return to my homeland. Once again, and more firmly, I refused, telling him that I didn't want to go there... When I later took reasonable steps because I refused to go back, this greatly broke our friendship... I don't want to hide it, I say it with great emotion, losing Gorky was very sad and painful for me."</p>
<p>In fact, Chaliapin doesn't have to be sad and painful. Gorky's friendship was no longer necessary for him. He could no longer gain instruction from Gorky. ………</p>

<p>— Translated by Maupassant Li Weike</p>
<p>"Don't you remember that day on the "Pearl" fishing boat you wanted to row more forcefully than me? Don't you remember all the flattering words you said in front of her? But the result made you die of jealousy! Later, when I got this property, you became even more crazy, so you hated me, and you expressed your hatred in various ways. You made everyone suffer, and you never stopped spitting out the bile that suffocated you."</p>
<p>Pier clenched his two fists, wishing he could jump on him and strangle his throat:</p>
<p>"Ah! Shut your beak, don't talk about this property again!"</p>
<p>Jean shouted again</p>
<p>"But jealousy is seeping out of your skin. Not a single word you said to your father, mother, or me did not contain jealousy. Because you were jealous, you pretended to look down on me! Because you were jealous, you tried to quarrel with everyone. And now that I'm rich, you can't stand it anymore, you've become poison, you're tormenting our mother, as if it's her fault!..."</p>
<p>Pier kept retreating to the fireplace, his lips half-open, his eyes wide, he had the kind of rage that could make people commit crimes. He repeated in a lower but panting voice:</p>
<p>"Shut your beak, shut your beak!"</p>
<p>"I've wanted to tell you what I've been thinking for a long time; you've given me this opportunity now, so you're drinking poison yourself. I loved"</p>
<p>A woman! You know this, and you mock her in front of me, you've forced me to a dead end; so you're drinking poison yourself. But if you do it again, I'll smash those poisonous teeth of yours! I'll force you to respect me."</p>
<p>"Respect you, me?"</p>
<p>"That's right, respect me!"</p>
<p>"Respect you... you... you who have disgraced our family for your greed?"</p>
<p>"What did you say? Say it again... say it again, okay?..."</p>
<p>"I said that no one would accept someone else's property if it meant becoming someone else's son."</p>
<p>Jean stood still, unmoving, he didn't understand his words, he was panicked by the implication of his words:</p>
<p>"What? What did you say... say it again, okay?"</p>
<p>"I said that everyone is whispering, everyone is spreading the word, saying that you are the son of the person who left you the property. Listen carefully, a self-respecting child would not accept money that would tarnish his mother's reputation."</p>
<p>"Pier... Pier... Pier... you even thought of this? ...You... said such insulting words?"</p>
<p>"That's right... I... this is what I said. Haven't you noticed how heartbroken I've been for a month? I don't sleep all night, and I hide like a beast during the day; I'm in so much pain and shame that I don't even know what I'm saying, what I'm doing, or what I'll become, because I only guessed at first, but now I understand."</p>
<p>"Pier... shut up... Mom is in the next room! She'll hear us... she'll hear us."</p>
<p>But he had to get his thoughts off his chest! So he told everything, his suspicions, his speculations, his internal struggles, the certainty he had gained, and the story of the portrait that had been lost and found again.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange Could Not Resolve the Dispute Between One and Two Sessions of Trading in the Afternoon, and the Brokers Convened a General Meeting in the Morning. After Two Discussions, Because the Delivery Was Near, the Relationship Was Relatively Large, So It Was Resolved That Four Sessions Would Be Done Every Day Before the Delivery This Month, and the Method Would Be Ordered Again After the Delivery Based on the Number of Transactions. Therefore, the Morning Market Opened at 10:00, and the Head Session Sold Various Futures With the 20th Representing the 75th in Large Quantities, and the Market Price Could Not Be Established. Except for the 19th Customs Duty, Which Was Relatively Stable, the Rest Showed a Trend of Approaching a Low.

Speculators Paid No Attention to Good and Bad Commercial News, But Were Uniquely Concerned About Various Things That Were Unfavorable to the Market, Including the Inspection of the Work of Speculative Companies, the Possibility of Government Supervision of the Exchange, and the Appreciation of the US Dollar Due to the Fixed Gold Price, Etc. The Total Number of Transactions for the Day Was 2.16 Million Shares. "Wheat" Fell Terribly by 0.3 Points. Due to the Disappearance of Famous Speculator Jesse Livermore, the Police Authority Believed He Was Kidnapped, and Because Soviet Russia Had 225,000,000 Bushels of Wheat That Could Be Exported, the Longs Tended to Sell. The Department of Agriculture Estimated That the Condition of Winter Wheat on December 1 Was 74.3 Per Hundred, Compared to 68.9 Percent Last Year.

<p>Sales of spot yarn remain sluggish. It is estimated that various merchant groups purchased a total of 314 bales today, with prices falling by five jiao. The purchase amounts by each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou: 23, Inland: 151, Jiangxi: 25, Luzhou: 10, Nanjing: 5</p>
<p>Ningbo: 40, Guangdong: 35, Northern merchants: 5, Zhenjiang: 15, Fellow merchants: 5</p>
<p>The cotton market's downward trend is gradually emerging due to the approaching end of the year, tight financial conditions, and higher cotton prices compared to yarn prices. Factory demand is quite sluggish, as there is no outlet for yarn, making it difficult to purchase raw materials. Consequently, the spot cotton market price is lower than the futures price. Another explanation is that the Pu Yi Factory is still hesitant about receiving goods. Daily factory inventories of cotton yarn are increasing, cotton imports are particularly sluggish, and there are still concerns about falling prices of Indian cotton.</p>

Prices for all months fell by three, four, and five jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 50,700 dan.

<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, all months showed a consistent downward trend. Foreign wheat quotations in Chicago fell by eight jiao to one yuan, and in Canada, they fell by approximately twelve jiao. Therefore, at the opening, sentiment was already weak. Currently, the market trend is that although the government has announced a tax increase on foreign wheat, in reality, the tax increase and market consumption cannot be integrated. Moreover, after the tax increase, the pricing of foreign wheat is cheaper than before, which is unexpected by most people. Therefore, although trading is not brisk, the market has already declined. By the time the afternoon session opened, market sentiment for all months remained weak and unsustainable. Outside investors were eager to sell, predicting that the trend for current foreign wheat would still be low prices. The market's inability to stand firm is likely still influenced by international surpluses. This month's price fell by three fen compared to the previous day, January fell by two and a half fen, February and March fell by two fen and two and a half li, April fell by four fen, and May fell by three and a half fen.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market this morning and afternoon, the market for all months suddenly showed a sharp decline. Foreign wheat quotations in Chicago fell by approximately eight jiao to one yuan, and in Canada, they fell by approximately twelve jiao. Therefore, after the opening, sentiment was already negatively affected. The opening prices for all months fell invisibly by five to six fen. By the time the afternoon session opened, prices fell by another four to five fen. The cause of the decline was partly due to the receivers for this month slightly hedging far-term contracts. A certain trader had two to three thousand tons of foreign wheat in hand and took the opportunity to sell. However, with few buyers in the market and inland traders inactive, the selling pressure increased, resulting in a sharp decline. As a result, February fell sharply by one jiao and one fen compared to the previous day. March and April fell by one jiao, and the remaining months did not open.

<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from various merchant groups numbered over 50 (7,000-8,000 shi), with late rice still scarce, accounting for nearly 20. The movement and purchasing of bagged rice by visiting merchants have also virtually stopped. This is because the Winter Solstice festival is approaching according to the lunar calendar, so even if they buy, it is only in small quantities. Therefore, most of the rice sold recently has been stored in upper-level warehouses. Consequently, although sellers want to tighten prices due to the scarcity of goods, it is ultimately difficult to achieve, resulting in a flat market condition with a hint of weakness. It is estimated that the market sold over 2,000 bags yesterday, with visiting merchants accounting for only 400-500 bags. The sales of various japonica and Du Yang long-grain rice are still good, but market conditions remain stable. Demand from distilleries for yeast-transformed rice is quite strong, and market sentiment has risen by one chi.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Sources from various routes numbered 58-59. Sales of various goods in the market are slow. Prices for white japonica, Yang Du, and visiting merchants' long-grain rice are down several fen. Thin rice and yeast-transformed rice are stable.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Visiting Xian Rice Depreciates but Sells Well <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Recently, arrivals of visiting Xian rice have gradually increased. Due to the price increase at the beginning of the month, various regions have been transporting rice to Shanghai. Currently, Shanghai's inventory has exceeded 150,000 bags, and the quantity of goods en route or about to arrive is also considerable. However, when this batch arrived in Shanghai, the regular rice warehouses had no transactions, and traders were anxious and eager to sell. Yesterday, various parties dumped and sold at reduced prices, causing prices to fall by about half a jiao. Only after the price reduction did local merchants inquire. Half of the sales in this street went to speculators who were looking for opportunities to stockpile. The visiting rice mostly belonged to the Fuzhou merchant group. The transactions in this street involved over 1,200 bags of Ji Yuan, Ji Zao, Ji Wan, Ji You, Ji Jing, and Bao Zao rice. The Fuzhou merchants bought a total of 1,500 bags of unpolished Jing, You, Hong, and Shashi unpolished rice, as well as Mingguang polished rice. Other visiting merchant groups did not inquire about the goods.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Amoy Merchants Increase Purchases of Red Grain <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Since the new crop of red grain entered the market, the trend has been stable, and the supply has not surged. It is currently estimated that there are around 20 trucks. In addition to sales to inland regions, yesterday, Amoy merchants purchased one truck of new red husked grain at a price of 3.05 yuan, and three trucks of Chong red husked grain at a price of 2.95 yuan. There were no changes in the market. Yesterday was the first time the Amoy merchants purchased new crop grain, with some transactions in old crop grain, but the trading volume was only 100-200 bags, so the market did not pay much attention.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Sugar Market: New Chaoqing Sugar Prices Rebound Tightly <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw the Dutch exchange rate slightly decline and gold prices tighten, leading to a stable trend. The Association set the price for No. 24 coarse granulated white ordinary sugar at 19.77 yuan, an increase of two fen compared to the previous day. Re-export goods were quoted at 7 yuan. No. 20 medium granulated white ordinary sugar was quoted at 19.40 yuan. No. 8-9 Dutch red ordinary sugar was set at 15.70 yuan, and re-export goods were quoted at 7.05 yuan. Da Ji Sugar B mark was 20.25 yuan, with limited supplies. CW mark was discounted by one fen, at 20.09 yuan. According to telegrams from Shantou, new Chaoqing sugar prices have rebounded due to various merchant groups buying at low prices, leading to a shortage of goods. The Shanghai market also saw a tightening trend. Yesterday, 300 bags of were opened, with prices ranging from 14 yuan to 13.80 yuan. Rao Ji No. 1 cotton white sugar remained at 18.90 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Decline Across the Board <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>(Lackluster Sales of Foreign Silk) Overseas raw silk markets are experiencing strong selling pressure from Japanese silk, and general holders of spot silk are actively selling as foreign exchange rates lengthen. As a result, silk prices in New York and Lyon have declined across the board. Both Chinese and foreign silk merchants in Shanghai are adopting a negative attitude, and the silk market is quiet. Yesterday, 25 bales were distributed to local silk factories such as Daohuang and Baichang, with prices remaining flat and weak.</p>
<p>(20 Dan of Double Cocoon Silk Transported to Hunan) Sales of double cocoon silk have been slow to improve. Inland buyers of cotton for stripping are making sporadic purchases. Yesterday, 20 dan of double cocoon silk were transported by small boat to Pinghu, Hunan, for use in cotton stripping.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Increasingly Stagnant) Due to tight foreign exchange rates, it is difficult for artificial silk prices to fall. As the end of the year approaches, financial conditions are extremely tight, and sales are increasingly stagnant. Yesterday, only 18 boxes of current and futures goods of Yunmeiwen and other imported Kaili brand Samsung and other brands were sold, with prices ranging from 182.75 yuan to 173.25 yuan net.</p>

<h3 id="e280">Domestic Sea Shrimp Holds Exclusive Advantage <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>Sea shrimp, also written as sea shrimp, is a type of small fish produced in coastal waters. "Yinxian Zhi": "Yin has a small fish, its taste is like dried shrimp, commonly called sea shrimp." "Bei Hu Lu": "Enzhou produces goose feather shrimp, preserved in salt, as thin as hair, with an exceptionally delicious taste." This is the origin of the name sea shrimp. However, it is usually written as "sea swallow" or "sea salt," which is actually incorrect. According to "sea swallow," it is a migratory bird (i.e., swallow) that must cross the sea to reach warm regions, hence the name sea swallow. Ancient people said, "Sea swallows nest in pairs on玳瑁梁 [tortoiseshell beams]," referring to this type of swallow. "Sea salt" is a county name, belonging to Zhejiang Qiantang Road. Therefore, writing "sea shrimp" as "sea swallow" or "sea salt" is not only different in pronunciation but also vastly different in meaning and cannot be interchanged. Here, I am the first to point this out to correct the common errors. (Editor's note: also written as sea salted)</p>
<p>Sea shrimp can be roughly divided into two types: (1) "Coarse Cinnamon" or "Medium Cinnamon," about one inch long (those longer than one inch are called coarse cinnamon, those less than one inch are called medium cinnamon), with fine scales, a thicker head, a golden-yellow back, and a slightly bluish-white belly; the taste is fresh. (2) Fine Cinnamon, four to five fen long, with a light yellow body, scales so fine they are indistinguishable, and a taste even more delicious than the former. (The word "cinnamon" is a substitute name for sea shrimp; people in the trade often refer to it as "cinnamon" instead of "sea shrimp.")</p>
<p>The Shanghai market sells both Japanese and domestic goods. Japanese goods are produced in places like Fuji; domestic goods are produced in several places: Ningbo 新化, Jiangshan 温州, Yantai, Weihaiwei, etc. The biggest disadvantage of Japanese sea shrimp is that it is bland and tasteless; its advantage is that it is lighter in weight and has fewer head crumbs. Smaller merchants often stock Japanese goods for retail convenience; however, from the consumer's point of view, taste is naturally the priority. Therefore, in order to meet customer demand, merchants must also consider stocking domestic goods in moderate quantities. As a result, domestic sea shrimp can still hold an exclusive advantage in the market, looking down on inferior goods. As for the different grades of domestic sea shrimp, the best is the fine cinnamon produced in the Beichu ocean area of Ningbo (there is also a single-top and double-tip type, with the double-tip being finer and more uniform, which is the highest grade). The next best is produced in Huangqi and Wushan. The goods produced in Xinhua and Jiangshan, whether fine cinnamon or coarse cinnamon, are also very good. Wenzhou sea shrimp (both fine and coarse types) are of good quality and affordable prices, and are the most common. The goods produced in Yantai and Weihaiwei have the advantages of Japanese goods, but also the disadvantages of Japanese goods, which is a pity. However, they are sufficient to replace Japanese goods and meet the demand.</p>
<p>China's coastline is several times longer than Japan's, yet many marine products must be imported from Japan, which is thought-provoking. In fact, there are many things that, if developed and promoted, would be sufficient to rival Japanese goods in both quantity and quality and meet the needs of the Chinese people. Sea shrimp is one such product. The reporter sincerely hopes that merchants in the industry and consumers who need it will pay close attention!</p>

<h3 id="e301">A Must-Read Book for Young People - The Spring and Autumn Annals <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>The matter of "New Book Recommendations" is, it is said, quite fashionable in today's literary world, and some have even engaged in extensive written disputes over it. This has prompted me to bring out an old book that has long been stored in my mind, wanting to join in the excitement and "recommend it" to the general literary youth of today.</p>
<p>Upon stating the name of the book to be recommended, no one will find it strange, it is such a familiar name. What is strange is the point on which its application is broad, yet it is never noticed.</p>
<p>That is none other than our Master Kong’s (Confucius) own great work, "The Spring and Autumn Annals."</p>
<p>This is truly a good book that only those "born with knowledge" can create. Although it records the historical events of rise and fall over 242 years, it actually contains the essence of the "Chinese people." Reading it can not only help with writing, but also serve as a foundation for being a person.</p>
<p>I have often argued that when people write today, they often make mistakes. Half of the reason is due to environmental factors, but the other half is largely due to the authors not having read "The Spring and Autumn Annals."</p>
<p>Writing abhors directness, as directness easily pricks others' wounds. The principles of "The Spring and Autumn Annals" are: "Subtle and gentle." "Subtle" means not abandoning one's own position, while "gentle" means not offending the other party. Sometimes it contains hidden satire, and sometimes it subtly protects; this is truly the secret to being a person and writing well throughout the ages.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is clear that it is ridiculing the emperor for sending envoys to mourn the concubine of a feudal lord, which is inappropriate, but "The Spring and Autumn Annals" says: "The Heavenly King sent the steward Xuan to return the funeral gifts of Zhongzi of Duke Hui." The writing is so gentle. It is clear that the feudal lords are summoning the king, but "The Spring and Autumn Annals" says: "The Heavenly King hunted in Heyang." The cover-up is so strict. These are all the subtle and profound meanings of the ancient sages, and the modern terms such as "shortening the front lines" and "already understood" are probably derived from here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, China is a country of "rites and morals," and "The Spring and Autumn Annals" is even more a textbook of rites and morals. The so-called "one word of praise is more glorious than the finest robes; one word of condemnation is more severe than an axe," is enough to make "rebellious ministers and treacherous sons" fear in their hearts.</p>
<p>Zheng Qiao's commentary on "The Spring and Autumn Annals" states: "In general, if 'The Spring and Autumn Annals' records a person's goodness, then people throughout the ages will point to them as a good person; if it records their evil, then people throughout the ages will point to them as an evil person." Therefore, the good and evil deeds of the rulers and ministers over 242 years cannot escape the 18,000 words. The pen is so powerful that people thousands of years later still feel chills down their spines upon hearing it. This kind of writing has now been learned by some people and is already being tested. They come up with many posthumous titles, such as "laborious and meritorious," "extremely heinous," and so on, to add to the people they want to target. However, whether this kind of writing can be as respected as Master Kong's masterpiece "The Spring and Autumn Annals" in the thousands of years to come, making people feel chills down their spines upon seeing it, is not yet known. In short, this is also a writing style that is worth emulating and should undoubtedly be paid attention to by modern literary youth.</p>
<p>Secondly, the great principle of "respecting the king and expelling the barbarians," which is a self-praising and self-aggrandizing idea, must also be known.</p>
<p>China is a country of "rites and morals," so apart from the word "name," which must be fought for, everything else can be resolved through "kingly ways." Confucius said, "The instruments of state cannot be lent to others," which is not only the words of a "sage," but also the words of all Chinese people. Therefore, although the Zhou dynasty was declining, it must be respected; although the barbarians were strong, they must be suppressed. At the end of "The Spring and Autumn Annals," there was only a fragmented "Old Zhou Shop" that was barely holding on, but it still had to put on a brave face and respect it as the "royal family." And towards the powerful state of Chu, which was threatening China, it used terms like "Jing," "Chu," "person," and "son" to indicate that it was not the same as China. Although at that time, many members of the Zhou royal family and descendants of the Tang and Yu dynasties were indeed destroyed by the strong state of Chu, our Master Kong always adhered to the principle of "not engaging in any relationship in writing" and "not recognizing" them. Although this policy could not save the various states from the disaster of destruction at the time, it seems to be successful now.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Didn't Chu and the other states disappear now? "Please see those who destroy others, their own country will also be destroyed," but Chu was given a "condemnation" by Master Kong, a condemnation that still makes people feel regret when they read "The Spring and Autumn Annals." Doesn't justice therefore remain between heaven and earth? Therefore, this kind of writing is also worth learning, at least it can comfort oneself under the serious national crisis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hu Anguo said, "Understand 'The Spring and Autumn Annals,' and then one can weigh the affairs of the world." There are so many people who want to "weigh the affairs of the world" now, so "recommending" this "Spring and Autumn Annals," which has been ridiculed as "broken court reports," is not only enough to help with writing and serve as a foundation for being a person.</p>
<h3 id="e302">China Possesses the "Magic of a Beautiful Woman" <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>In the past few months, our China has had Bernard Shaw's "round-the-world trip" to visit, with Malraux passing through and investigating, and recently, the French novelist Colette has followed in the footsteps of Shaw and Malraux to tour our great country. These people are either veterans of the literary world or famous celebrities and writers, which shows that China can truly be said to be a place where all nations come to pay tribute, and "literary stars are shining brightly"!</p>
<p>According to reports, Colette was "captivated for several days" by the singer Xue Yanqin in the Confucius Temple in Nanjing. After developing a fondness for the old capital, the "center of past dynasties," in Beijing, he hurriedly departed for Japan without saying goodbye. However, he has been a bachelor for decades and can be said to be "free from worldly desires," but upon arriving in China, he was unable to escape, being captivated wherever he went, filled with a dream of marrying a "humorous Chinese woman with Oriental beauty to comfort his life." Only because of a warning from a "romantic female writer" that he did not win the favor of Chinese women, did he give up on Chinese women so resolutely? No; he only felt admiration for Chinese women, regretting that "they met too late and separated too quickly." How could he be discouraged by this? Before departing, he said, "The beauty of China is like the magic of a beautiful woman. If someone rejects this magic, they will surely regret it ten thousand years later." It can be seen that his affection is so strong that he probably wishes to be married to a Chinese woman for countless lifetimes, and, moreover, he cannot forget China! Therefore, after traveling in Japan, Colette will still return!</p>
<p>Indeed, in my opinion, China also has beauty like the magic of a beautiful woman, with Shanghai, the "Paris of the East," the ancient city that is the "center of past dynasties," and the beautiful women who "wear clothes as if wrapped around the body," and who are specially waiting for these foreign celebrities to enjoy. However, like our female writer's warning to Colette, although he praised "Oriental beauty" and "Chinese beauty" after attending banquets and receptions hosted by ministries and associations and interacting with our distinguished ladies, I am afraid he still lacks a deep understanding of "Chinese beauty" and "Oriental beauty."</p>
<p>China has magnificent mountains and rivers, inexhaustible and inexhaustible wealth, a mild and bright climate, and a "peaceful and honest" people. All of this has been praised by foreign "travelers" and "inspection groups." However, Colette only praised the ancient Guangdong, the ancient heart of prosperity, which shows that he still does not have a thorough understanding of "Chinese beauty." Chinese women have morals of "upholding propriety and righteousness," the gentleness of elegance and harmony, the clear teachings of the three obediences and four virtues, and the simplicity of marrying for virtue, not for appearance. However, Colette saw only the modern ladies who "wear clothes as if wrapped around the body" and thought they were "indescribably beautiful," further indicating that he does not have a deep understanding of the unique "Oriental beauty" of our country's women.</p>
<p>However, Colette is a novelist and has the demeanor of a literary figure. It is said that he is also very "humorous," and his "absurd and unfounded" remarks should be interpreted as humor. He compares China to a beautiful woman, and I believe it deserves the "beauty" that it possesses (not sensuality!). Furthermore, he says that "Chinese beauty" is like "the magic of a beautiful woman," which also symbolizes that China's current seductiveness is indeed extremely strong. This point, when examined in reality, is precisely the point. At the same time, since it is already a beautiful woman and also has magic, it is inevitable that it will cause many men to be infatuated and passionate. It is a matter of course that many politicians, military strategists, diplomats, and scientists and artists have recently come to China to "court" from afar and have also added various praises in our pleasant conversations, which is a glimpse of their state of being infatuated with "Chinese beauty." However, the "magic of a beautiful woman" is too great, and it is bound to cause the permissible "lovers" to fight for love, which will lead to unfortunate events before our eyes. Therefore, we should not be arrogant and conceited because Colette praises us as "beautiful" and having "magic." We must be vigilant against the unfortunate events caused by being too "beautiful and having magic"!</p>
<p>At the same time, although China has the "magic of a beautiful woman" and is rich in "Oriental beauty," after all, it is now a time when Europeanization and "modernity" are prevalent, and the temptation of material things is great, so it is inevitable that it will fall into the path of "degeneration." Today, one can talk about love with this "man," and tomorrow, one can marry another "man," and one can even use the "magic of a beautiful woman" to practice romanticism. Why not practice the sale of both body and soul? I advise Colette to turn back as soon as possible and not be too infatuated with our "Oriental beauty" and "the magic of a beautiful woman"!</p>
<h3 id="e303">Fallen Man <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— A Qin</p>
<p>Ever since Old Master Zhao's family took in a daughter-in-law, he's been feeling rather vexed these past few days. The reason isn't exactly displeasure with his newly wedded daughter-in-law, but rather another matter arising from this joyous event.</p>
<p>Today, he's once again sitting in the accounting room, flipping through his rent rice ledger. It's because the new grain has long been brought in from the fields, but the rent rice coming in is still sparse.</p>
<p>He opened the first page, which read:</p>
<p>"Gu Shiguan household, farming ten mu, not yet returned." He was a bit displeased and casually flipped down;</p>
<p>"Chen Changsheng household, farming four mu, repaid old debts ten yuan, new rent outstanding."</p>
<p>"Li Erguan household, farming five mu, two harvests unpaid."</p>
<p>"Lu Ahu household, farming two mu, repaid old rent five yuan, paid new rent five yuan, balance outstanding."</p>
<p>"Shen Wensheng household, farming twelve mu, old debts fifteen yuan, new rent unpaid."</p>
<p>"Wang Jinbao household, farming seven mu, unpaid."</p>
<p>"Yang Atu household, farming fifteen mu, unpaid."</p>
<p>"............owing a certain amount."</p>
<p>"............unpaid."</p>
<p>After flipping through a few pages, he couldn't help but feel vexed again. He thought, "Life used to be so good. Rice sold for seven or eight yuan per shi, and each mu of farmland yielded at least six or seven yuan in rent. In one winter, the money would come in neatly by the thousands. Now, each mu of farmland only yields about four yuan, and there are still arrears every year. When collecting from them, they always say that farming folks are suffering, the harvest this year is bad, and the rice price is too low. They need to keep some rice at home for their wives, mothers, and children to survive. I'm tired of hearing these kinds of words. These people are truly hateful. Is it only farming that is hard? Are landowners not suffering in this era? You need to survive, but don't landlords need to survive? Hateful creatures, they should all be locked up!" The more Old Master Zhao thought, the angrier he became, and he threw the ledger onto the table.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a "grain certificate" fell out of the ledger unintentionally. He picked it up and looked at it, equally unintentionally. This further fueled his anger.</p>
<p>He read:</p>
<p>"Unified levy silver one tael five mace, with additional levy for autonomous district expenses two jiao five fen, education expenses one yuan, rural pacification donation two jiao, defense donation five jiao, road construction mu donation one yuan two jiao five fen, military surtax one yuan, peasant bank fund three jiao, airplane donation three jiao five, Party headquarters expenses four jiao five fen, rice special tax nine jiao, land survey fee five jiao, district office expenses four jiao five fen............" He thought, "Damn it! These dog officials, after eating their fill, only know how to come up with all kinds of new taxes. The official tax is one tael five mace, but the surtaxes and donations exceed it by more than twenty times. They don't care whether people can bear it or not, just shouting slogans like 'rural bankruptcy' and 'relief for rural areas,' but in reality, they act as if the current rural bankruptcy isn't enough, and they are doing everything to increase the burden on the owners. In the past, families who owned one or two hundred mu of land could be considered well-off. Apart from the year's expenses, they would always have a surplus of one or two thousand yuan at the end of the year. But now, it's impossible to get by without borrowing. But opening one's mouth to borrow money is embarrassing, and all the expenses cannot be reduced urgently. Just like this time, for my son's wedding, I spent more than ten thousand yuan. The daughter-in-law is from an old family, so all the customary rituals had to be observed as usual. Although outsiders say that my Zhao family is still doing well, who knows how much thought I've put into it? And like my second son, for the sake of family reputation, he has to study, and I have to pay eighteen hundred yuan in tuition every year. Alas, this situation is really not as good as in the past, and it seems like it's going to get worse............"</p>
<p>He collapsed wearily into the chair, unable to think any further.</p>
<h3 id="e304">Swearing Oaths <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>Swearing oaths is undoubtedly a kind of "national essence." The Analects records that our Confucius once went to see Nanzi, the wife of Duke Ling of Wei - a woman famous for her licentiousness - causing displeasure among his "unable to die a natural death" disciple, Zilu. Thereupon, our Old Master panicked, fearing that his straightforward disciple would say something unpleasant. He swore an oath, saying, "If I deny it, may Heaven forsake me! May Heaven forsake me!" to prove that his visit to Nanzi was not with any bad intentions. After this was said, Zilu naturally did not delve deeper, and so a comedy of discord between master and disciple passed by. Only ten characters were able to soften the heart of a man known for his "courage and fierce fighting," which shows a glimpse of the magical power of the two words "swearing oaths."</p>
<p>From then on, it has been passed down through the generations, revered as one of the "arts of getting along in the world." Whether it's high officials taking office or a neighbor losing a chicken, whenever there is internal shame or external suspicion, they must rely on these two words.</p>
<p>But the names may differ slightly. For example, the "official style" - or simply "official" - of swearing an oath is no longer called "swearing an oath," but "taking an oath." When taking an oath, one must invariably straighten one's clothes, solemn one's appearance, face the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, raise one's right hand, and read the printed oath. The oath says: "I solemnly and sincerely... If I violate this oath, I will accept the most severe punishment..." and so on. It is said that this is also a legal procedure that officials must go through, meaning to tell them that if they do wrong in the future, they cannot go back on their word. But in our memory, it seems that every official, when it is discovered that he already has the qualifications for "if I violate...", and is prepared to cash in on him, has mostly already wandered overseas or gone far away. As a result, this "most severe punishment" is often "undeliverable" due to "unknown address." There are probably many such dubious cases, and after some time, they can be sold as new goods again.</p>
<p>So, to put it bluntly, a rural woman's swearing oath is nothing more than lighting a few more incense sticks for the mud bodhisattvas in the City God Temple, and the swearing oath of high officials is just to join in the fun of the day! Otherwise, wouldn't it be too desolate!</p>
<p>All of these things, in essence, are the same. What was said earlier mostly concerns clarifying right and wrong, such as you saying I stole your chicken, and I saying I didn't steal it. If you still don't believe me, then I have to swear an oath, "If I stole your chicken, then I will be like this and like that." With "divine beings" as a guarantee, then you believe me. And what is being said now mostly belongs to hoping for the future, meaning to say, "Why don't you..." All of these words and phrases, at first glance, seem extremely generous, solemn, painful, and full of confidence; but upon closer thought, it is also felt that using one finger to point at the sun in the sky, and waving a hand with tears, saying "Destiny is like this, what more can be said" or saying with teeth chattering "In a few years, their country will naturally be like this and like that" is not easy to make people optimistic. On the contrary, it paints a picture of decline.</p>

<h3 id="e305">The White Scar on Old Wen's Head <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>——Five Yuan to Buy a Hair Restraining Cap——</p>
<p>Old Wen had a lifelong regret, which was that he didn't know what year it was, but when he was just a toddler who could walk, he had a boil on his head that festered for three months before it slowly closed and scabbed over. But from then on, hair never grew again, leaving a white scar the size of a wine cup.</p>
<p>When Old Wen was eleven years old, he went to town to take the entrance exam for higher elementary school. It was early autumn, and still so hot. By this time, he was already somewhat aware of the unseemliness of the white scar, so he put on his winter melon-skin cap early. He also grew his hair long, hearing that there were Western-style barbershops in town. He was fully prepared to get a Western-style "slicked-back" hairstyle, which he thought would surely cover up the white scar. On his way, the autumn sun fiercely beat down on his melon-skin cap, and smoke and water steamed from his hair. Only then did he loosen his melon-skin cap. There were few passersby, so there was naturally no need to worry.</p>
<p>Entering the town, his eyes constantly darted around at the shops on both sides. From the beginning of the street to the end of the alley, there wasn't a single barbershop with a sign. All there were were shop assistants standing on the street with short benches, shaving people's heads bald. He felt very disappointed.</p>
<p>Because of this, during his years of schooling in town, except for the unbearable heat of midsummer, when he really couldn't wear a hat and had to "let it be," his only method and only comfort in all seasons was relying on a melon-skin cap. Fortunately, wearing a black satin melon-skin cap was still considered very fashionable in the small town, otherwise he would have been even more troubled.</p>
<p>Well, he finally arrived one day in the infinitely prosperous Shanghai, where you could buy even living statues if you had the money.</p>
<p>At this time, he was older, and his "love of beauty" and "shyness" grew in direct proportion to his age. His dislike of the white scar on his head naturally became even stronger. Moreover, he had long known that there were all kinds of enchanting female students in Shanghai's schools, so on the day he entered school, his first move was to go to the beauty salon across the street from the school, and get a Western-style "slicked-back" hairstyle. The barber applied a thick layer of Stacomb to him, and combed it again and again. He tilted his head, rolled his eyes, and looked in the mirror. Sure enough, the white scar was gone. He felt immense comfort, so much so that even though the sign originally said "Gentlemen's Haircut Two Dimes," he was so generous that he reached out and gave the barber "forty-eight cents." The barber smiled and respectfully saw him out of the shop, and to the street.</p>
<p>Old Wen usually didn't have such high spirits. He whistled all the way back to school, practically going crazy with joy. He slept soundly that night, and when he woke up the next day, he smoothed his hair and looked in the mirror. He found a white scar again. He knew this was the inevitable result of not applying Stacomb and not combing. But he didn't know what the stuff applied to the hair was called, so he secretly asked another classmate. Then he rushed to a foreign goods store and bought a bottle. He then thickly applied a layer and carefully combed and combed, but he still couldn't hide that annoying white scar. In the end, his own technique was not good.</p>
<p>Thus, Old Wen felt the same kind of trouble he had in the melon-skin cap era, but it was even more severe. Going to class, he secretly sat in the last row, afraid of being seen by the female students, which would be so embarrassing.</p>
<p>The time was also exactly early autumn, and wearing a hat properly would undoubtedly make people laugh at him even more.</p>
<p>Old Wen was distressed. He thought left and right, but couldn't find a suitable solution. Later, a kind classmate offered him an idea, saying that he should go to the fabric street near the Four Horse Road and spend two dimes to buy a hair-restraining cap. That would be the best solution. He could wear it often in the dormitory, and it wouldn't matter if he wore it to class. If he wanted to be so particular about etiquette, he could first press his hair with a hair-restraining cap, then apply Stacomb, and then comb. The white scar could surely be covered up.</p>
<p>Old Wen thought it was a great idea.</p>
<p>So he went to buy one. The price of the cap was set at two dimes, and he gave the vendor a five-yuan bill. The vendor couldn't make change, so he took it to exchange, but said it was a fake bill. After arguing and pulling for a long time, Old Wen still suffered a loss, took back the fake bill, and gave the vendor "twenty-eight cents."</p>
<p>Old Wen returned, discouraged, and said to his classmates:</p>
<p>"Bad luck, really bad luck, five yuan to buy a hair-restraining cap!"</p>

<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(Thirty-Seven) Two People Who Don't Speak</p>
<p>Afterwards, Cousin left, and Sister Min saw her off for more than an hour. Upon returning, she organized clothes and other items alone in the bedroom, like someone about to leave on a long trip. I took a walk in the park for a while, walking through that newly paved sandy path. My heart felt even more uneasy. Returning to the company, my younger brother told me that my sister was going out. I hurried to the third floor. Sister Min buried her head in packing up small items. Seeing me step in, she raised her hands in a gesture of obstruction, saying:</p>
<p>"Don't come in, don't come in, I'm looking for something important."</p>
<p>"Xin Di said you're going out?" I really stopped in my tracks.</p>
<p>"Listen to what children say." Sister Min looked up, yawned, and said with a smile, as if she was very tired.</p>
<p>"Exactly what important thing did you lose, that you're searching the whole room? Tell me, I'll help you find it."</p>
<p>I stepped through the door and sat on a chair. The clothes hanging on the wall-mounted hangers were gone, and the other items on the writing desk in front of the window were also packed neatly. In any case, this situation was inconsistent with searching for items. Sister Min was still bent over, taking out a stack of shoe boxes from under the bed, throwing the broken ones out the door at random.</p>
<p>"Sister Min," I didn't expect the change to come so suddenly and quickly, and I supported her with both hands. "Sister Min, please tell me, your brother hasn't done anything wrong!"</p>
<p>"Who said you did something wrong?" She said and turned her head away, and I vaguely saw that her eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>I closed the door, helped her sit on the bed, and pulled over a chair for myself.</p>
<p>"Sister, if you don't have anything to apologize for, you told me this, you can't let your brother feel sorry forever. Sister, speak up, sister."</p>
<p>Sister Min lowered her head, playing with a piece of broken cardboard from a box in her hand.</p>
<p>"Sister, we escaped from our hometown together. Is this kind of ending what you want now? If you want to leave, I can't force you, but you always have to give a reason..."</p>
<p>Sister Min raised her tearful eyes and handed me a crumpled piece of paper from her bag. It was the letter from Cousin returning my letter. I didn't know when it had been lost.</p>
<p>"Sister Min, you agreed when I wrote this letter. Today, Sister Hui returned it to me, and I casually stuffed it in my pocket. It doesn't matter if it's lost."</p>
<p>"Hmph, you went to Xujiahui without telling me, did I agree to that too?"</p>
<p>"Sister, I understand, it wasn't Sister Hui who asked me out. Uncle had something to discuss with me. I left the letter he sent in the wastepaper basket downstairs. You can ask A Fu."</p>
<p>"Read this letter before you speak!"</p>
<p>I suspiciously unfolded the crumpled paper. It was my own handwriting, but there were two extra lines of pencil writing under the signature. Looking closely, I recognized:</p>
<p>"Brother, I accept all your advice. I will start over and be a person again. With the love we had when we were little, you can always forgive me. Today, I will use your coming or not coming to predict our result!"</p>
<p>Sister Min glared at me. My crime was judged and decided. No matter what I said, these two lines of pencil writing could not be forgiven.</p>
<p>A willow tree along the street, blown by the wind, peered in. The room was silent, with two people who didn't speak.</p>

<h3 id="e308">A Visit with the Owner of Jincheng Theater <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Yan</p>
<p>Everyone keeps shouting that the film industry is in a slump, but new theaters are still being built one after another. Now, on the corner opposite the Beijing Grand Theater, a tall building has been built. The skeleton of the building is almost complete, and it looks quite magnificent. In the high sky in front of the gate, a white sign with black characters reading "Jincheng Grand Theater" is revealed before my eyes. "Oh! Jincheng Grand Theater, so it's here!" I thought to myself, and then looked at the small characters below the large characters "Jincheng Grand Theater." Only then did I know that their office was opposite. Thinking that it was still early, I might as well go and talk to the staff inside, maybe I could get some new news about this theater that is about to open.</p>
<p>No sooner said than done, I stepped into their office. A young man with a slender figure and a lively spirit came out to greet me. It turned out that he was the owner of the theater, Mr. Liu Zhongliang. I told him my name and purpose, and we sat down on a long sofa and began to talk.</p>
<p>I first asked Mr. Liu if the Jincheng Grand Theater was a company or not; if there were any foreign shareholders; and how much capital it had. Mr. Liu told me that their company was built by him and his brother Zhonghao, who put up the capital. There were no other shareholders, and there was no question of foreign capital. As for the capital, their budget was 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>When I heard that two brothers had put up so much money to build a movie theater, I couldn't help but admire their courage and boldness. Because most of the movie theaters in Shanghai are companies. Just as I was about to continue asking questions, I suddenly saw Mr. Zhonghao walking over with a large bundle of seat cover materials, such as silk and velvet. Mr. Zhongliang also introduced me to him. Because he had to go inside to discuss other matters, he asked Mr. Zhonghao to talk to me instead.</p>
<p>"Do your brothers have a lot of experience with movies?" I continued to ask.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhonghao smiled and replied, "We founded a World Grand Theater in Nanjing, and it's been four years now. It's been pretty good. Last year, we bought a piece of land near the World Grand Theater and wanted to build a larger Guotai Grand Theater. Later, because we saw that many of the big movie theaters in Shanghai were funded by foreign capital, and the profits were flowing out, it was really disheartening. Therefore, my brother and I made a grand wish to create a popular theater in Shanghai. The current Jincheng is the realization of our plan."</p>
<p>"Then how many seats does your theater have? How will the ticket prices be in the future?"</p>
<p>Mr. Liu replied, "There are 1,800 seats. As for the ticket prices, they haven't been determined yet. In short, we are determined to promote film culture and popularize mass entertainment. Although the theater is built like an aristocratic place, the ticket prices will never be aristocratic."</p>
<p>"Will your theater show domestic films or foreign films in the future?"</p>
<p>"This matter has not yet reached the stage of announcement, so please excuse me for not being able to tell you. However, whether it's Chinese or foreign films, we are very strict about film selection."</p>
<p>We also talked about the importance of sound equipment. When Mr. Jin heard this, he said excitedly, "Although we have tested several sound systems, we have not yet made a decision. We are probably going to use the latest 1933 R.C.A. giant machine. Not only that, but for the comfort of the audience, we have also installed the latest air conditioners and heaters."</p>
<p>At this point, someone inside asked him to answer the phone, so I excused myself and left.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e309">Review of "Tiger Shark" <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>To suit the needs of the audience, films must be stimulating and lighthearted. This is a trend that can be seen in current American films and will inevitably become popular.</p>
<p>Take "Tiger Shark," produced by First National Pictures, for example. In addition to the essential love story, it also features the excitement of man fighting shark and the lightness of witty dialogue. It combines both stimulation and relaxation.</p>
<p>With the ocean as its backdrop, the film presents the lives of seaside fishermen, their fishing methods, the scenery of the ocean, and pure love in a vivid and lovely way, which cannot help but evoke our infinite admiration. Although this is not a documentary, the incorporation of a story and the insertion of ample local color are ultimately the greatest features of this film. This is where the value of the film lies.</p>
<p>Regarding the depiction of the protagonist, Mark, we must believe that the author was indeed successful. Loyalty, straightforwardness, and courage are merely simple literary adjectives, but to express them in a film, it is necessary to make us feel and understand them through the visuals. This is a very difficult task. The screenwriter allows him to fully display his lovable personality in his friendships. He sacrifices himself for his friends and saves poor orphans. However, although he needs the warmth of the opposite sex, women will not love him. Only an exceptional girl who repays his kindness is willing to reluctantly marry him. Of course, such a union is easily shaken for a passionate young man, just like a couple with a large age gap. When she meets the friend of her vigorous and strong husband, she quickly loses faith in her husband. In this regard, we cannot blame her in any way. At the same time, Mark's friend, who is like a brother, lives with the conflicting emotions of love and friendship, which also makes people feel sympathy for him. And the protagonist's temporary punishment of his good friend out of jealousy is not an excessive act. Everyone is a complex character, and everyone is tormented by conflicting emotions. As such, the screenwriter's ability to depict such conflicts and contradictions so perfectly is truly very successful. Similarly, the director's meticulous and economical depiction of love, as well as his strong emphasis on sketching life, is also a great success. Of course, minor shortcomings or methodological errors are inevitable. For example, the portrayal of the woman is too inadequate, which is a flaw. In addition, he also pays attention to sound effects, such as the monotonous piano music on a moonlit night, the sound of gunfire when lovers embrace, and the sound of bells when Mark is dying, all of which are not exaggerated and are very harmonious with the plot. Although these are all old methods.</p>
<p>Lead actor Edward G. Robinson, after "Little Caesar" or "Two Seconds," now has "Tiger Shark," which truly makes us believe in his high level of acting skills. Admittedly, his personality is consistently tough and bold, but it is greatly different in terms of good and evil from "Little Caesar" and quite similar to "Two Seconds." His performance alone is already very commendable. Lee Shumway has no special achievements, and the female lead is even more superficial. The cinematography is very successful.</p>
<h3 id="e310">"Stark Nature" <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Stark Nature</p>
<p>Human concepts are extremely complex. Therefore, "Tarzan the Ape Man" and the like satisfy a novelty and stimulation, and at the same time, they are an escape from reality and a pursuit of primitive life. Therefore, old film critics still have to make various embellished justifications for this point, but a film like "Stark Nature" leaves no room for justification.</p>
<p>What unfolds before the audience is the scenery of Africa; what is introduced to the audience are the foolish and docile natives. Moreover, here, we see Africa's abundant products and the endless reserves of gold and silver mines, which strongly hint at "Go to Africa!" Even if the lands of Africa have been divided up, there are still plenty of fat and blood to be squeezed from this unexploited group. Isn't it true that twentieth-century aggression does not necessarily require occupying land?</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not enough for the film to write these things from a positive perspective; it also finds material and spiritual justifications for the aggressors, namely, the white man's sense of superiority over all other races. In other words: it is the so-called civilizing mission of the white race. This point is written in the script as much as possible using contrast and setting off. Their intention is not only to say that invading Africa is helping the natives progress, but also that developing mines is like "discarding bad goods on the ground." Africa is the Africa of the white man. We have been hearing this phrase for more than a year. The survival of the fittest, the laws of natural selection, and Mr. Huxley's philosophy have a pro-Boer partiality. To those who say "philosophy is a partisan science, and so is the art," here, they encounter an iron-like answer!</p>
<p>Not only in terms of content, "Stark Nature" is a thorough propaganda film, but also in terms of form. Ordinary jungle films only introduce the protagonist's journey. At most, they mention the protagonist's return home, but "Stark Nature" is a narration after returning home. From this point, we already know that the author's intention is to propagandize.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects, first, we must know that "Stark Nature" can be said to be a newsreel and a scenic film because there is no story in the middle. Therefore, there is nothing to say about the screenplay. However, the editing has some good points. Because it is a dancer's narration, he allows the audience to understand this point everywhere. The method is through "prompts," and these "prompts" are seamlessly integrated with the overall unfolding. For example, when the natives dance, they are followed by the dancers of the burlesque show, which are not only similar in some places but also used for comparison. At the same time, the dancer's narration is triggered by the scene, and when he sees this kind of "burlesque dance," he thinks of the natives dancing, which is similar to it. Or, for example, when he talks about the natives dancing and wants the listener to concretely know the dance posture, he points out the similar "burlesque" dance as an example, which is extremely clever.</p>
<h3 id="e311">Latest News from Tianyi <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>▲A Movie Star: Filming of "A Movie Star" began in the summer, and nearly half a year has passed. Although it has been completed successfully, editing will still take time. This film uses a film company as its background. From the general manager to the laborers, everyone is shown on the screen. The scene of shooting a sound film is also introduced on the screen. Many people want to visit the film company's studio, but they often cannot find a way to enter. Now, in "A Movie Star," you can see it very clearly. The film is named "A Movie Star," but in reality, all the male and female stars participate in it. Therefore, there are more stars in "A Movie Star" than in any other film. With that being said, this film's title is a bit misleading.</p>
<p>▲Two-Year Plan: This two-year plan is not like the Soviet Union's "Five-Year Plan," which will only be completed after two years. These two "years" are the titles of two new films. One is "Passionate Youth," and the other is "Fleeting Years." They are directed by Tang Jie and Gao Lihong, who have newly transitioned from acting to directing at Tianyi. "Passionate Youth" stars Wang Yuanlong and Ye Qiuxin, and "Fleeting Years" stars Hu Shan and Ye Qiuxin. One is a patriotic drama, and the other is a moral drama. The themes of both are very good. These two films have been in production for more than two months, and now they have both been completed. The two-year plan can finally be declared complete.</p>
<p>▲Three Peking Operas: "Auspicious Land," directed by Shao Zuiweng and starring Chen Yumei, has now been sent to Beijing for review and will be released soon. Although the film is set in the countryside, there are many magnificent scenes in it. Just the scene of Xu Hongye marrying Xiang Gu, with hair ornaments, elegant clothing, and the clinking of cups, is already very lively. The three Peking operas are especially wonderful. The first opera is Miss Zhang Wenqi's "Farewell My Concubine," the second opera is Miss Fan's "Huai Du Pass," and the third opera is Zhang Zhenduo (as Xu Hongye) and Ye Qiuxin's (as Xu's concubine) "Mei Long Zhen." The two are singing enthusiastically on stage when suddenly a servant comes to report that the old master has died. Therefore, Xu Hongye does not have time to remove his makeup, takes off his beard, and hurriedly runs off the stage. For a moment, the order is in chaos, and the congratulatory guests become mourners.</p>
<p>▲All Sides Autumn Heart: Ye Qiuxin, the newly discovered star of the film world in 1933, her beauty can simply be a model for all beauty and is worthy of being called a "model beauty." She has recently been suddenly promoted to the leading role in four films, and the people co-starring with her are all first-class superstars in the film world, such as Chen Yumei in "Flame of Youth," Hu Shan in "Fleeting Years," Wang Yuanlong in "Passionate Youth," and Hu Shan and Lu Lixia in "A Movie Star." Like a thunderclap out of the blue, Qiuxin can also be very proud. A poem praises her: "Autumn heart is more beautiful than spring heart, all sides are exquisite, reflecting the superstars."</p>
<p>▲Five Routes of Advancement: Schools have some kind of three-three system. Now, Tianyi's film production can be said to be a five-five system. The films that have been completed but not yet released are: "Auspicious Land," "Flame of Youth," "Passionate Youth," "A Movie Star," and "Fleeting Years," a total of five films. There are also several films planned to be produced. One is "Happy Enemies," starring Chen Yumei, one is "Spring Dreams in the Dance Palace," starring Wang Cilong and Lu Lixia, one is "Roots Do Not Meet Before Marriage," starring Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing, one is "Lin Chong," starring Wang Yuanlong, and there is also "Peace Blossom," originally written by Zhang Henshui and adapted by Yan Duhe, with the female lead played by Chen Yumei, and the rest of the cast is yet to be determined. With such five routes of advancement, it will surely create a dazzling, colorful spectacle that is even more beautiful than Zhuge Wuhou's Eight Trigrams Formation.</p>

<p>— Tianfu</p>
<p>(3) The Fate of Man and Dog</p>
<p>There is only one world, but the people living in this world are governed by an unknowable fate into two completely different circles. 丨丨 The day is gradually getting late. After the signal for the end of work at the yarn factory rang, the people in the factory poured out of the gate like a tide. 丨丨 Mr. Zhou, the comprador, was driven by a motorcycle to buy many expensive sweets to go back to his mansion to see his wife. 丨丨 At this time, his wife just happened to get up 丨丨 Hundreds and thousands of male and female workers dragged their tired bodies back to their shacks to rest. The injured child was also carried home by his sister and several workers.</p>
<p>The so-called "home": is a small mezzanine. Old Chen, who works as a vendor, is preparing to cook dinner. There is a commotion outside the door, and his injured brother is carried in. This unexpected misfortune hits Old Chen's heart like a punch. He is flustered and loses his composure. "What's going on? What's……?" He asks in a panic, and his sister tells him, crying, with the last sentence being: "The doctor said... he won't make it..."</p>
<p>Sadness, sorrow, and anger are concentrated in the minds of the two people at this time. Just let him die like this? At least get a doctor to take a look, of course. But what about the money? What is groped out of the pocket is only enough to eat pancakes! 丨丨 The two people look at each other with pitiful eyes. Finally: "You take good care of him. I'll go get some money from your sister-in-law." Old Chen says these words decisively and goes out.</p>
<p>Old Chen's woman works as a maid at Xie's mansion. 丨丨 Old Chen's sister and brother were able to go to work at that yarn factory thanks to their sister-in-law's introduction. 丨丨 He goes straight to Zhou's mansion. He gets five or six dollars from his woman, but he sees a sad scene at Zhou's mansion 丨丨 A veterinarian's bill collector is collecting a bill from the comprador's wife: the medical expenses for a pug cost thirty silver dollars.</p>
<p>"Look! Other people's dogs cost so much money to treat when they get sick!" Old Chen and Old Chen's woman look at the backs of the comprador's wife and the bill collector, silent, like two towering stone statues.</p>
<p>(4) The Lesson of the Rats</p>
<p>At seven o'clock, dusk quietly creeps into the embrace of this big city. With the money, Old Chen hires a doctor to examine his brother once. After the doctor leaves, looking at the child lying stiffly on the bed, he says sadly to himself: "Some people wear good clothes, eat good food, and play with good things; even dogs cost dozens of dollars to treat when they get sick. What about us?……"</p>

<p>Situation of Organization and Facilities of Yunfei Automobile Company</p>
<h3 id="e313">Self-Made Car Bodies <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>Yunfei Automobile Company puts special effort into the construction and style of car bodies. Therefore, the main work of the carpentry workshop in the head office is to engage in the construction of the car frame, which is the foundation of the car body. All car frames are made of especially strong, light, and absolutely non-decaying Philippine super-grade wood. This wood is always kept in large quantities to supply the manufacture of new car bodies. This is because, in order to meet the needs of business, new cars must often be added. The frames that are made, if they are of special dimensions, are all protected with a special metal containing copper to prevent rust. In addition to the car body frame, the screen frame is also manufactured and assembled by the carpentry workshop. If you visit and observe in person, you can see all kinds of car bodies in the process of being manufactured at a glance. This is not only for new cars, but also for vehicles that must have their bodies removed after ten months of driving and completely rebuilt.</p>
<p>Yunfei Main Office New Building on Great Western Road</p>
<h3 id="e314">Widespread Branch Stations <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>Yunfei has more than a dozen branch stations. They are all located in key areas and provide convenient services. In addition to the main station, the larger branch stations can accommodate more than fifty cars, which can definitely meet the needs of each location. Yunfei has many branch stations, so no matter where you are in the city, once you call for a car, the nearest station can immediately dispatch a car to go. As for after the ride is over, wherever you get off, the car will return to the station nearest to that location. This saves time and fuel, and the car will last longer. The allocation of vehicles to each station is determined based on need. This is based on the time of day and the weather.</p>
<h3 id="e315">Vehicle Inspection <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>Yunfei Automobile Company stipulates that each car wheel must enter the dock for inspection every ten days and be given various minor repairs. Every ten months, the car is completely disassembled and repaired separately. For example, the chassis is repaired by the chassis workshop, and the engine is repaired by the machine workshop, so that it is perfect and flawless, and no different from new. Other parts, such as crankshafts and transmissions, are all subjected to final inspection before being reassembled into a car. The various spare parts that are prepared are too numerous to count, such as springs and spark plugs, and are all neatly displayed for immediate replacement. Furthermore, all parts used in the car body, such as door locks, as well as various tools used in the machine workshop, are self-made and do not need to be sought externally. This shows the grand scale, complete equipment, and exquisite technology of the company. As for seeing the working situation at that time, one can deeply believe that Yunfei automobiles drive safely and quickly through the streets, which is undoubtedly after a great deal of heavy work.</p>
<h3 id="e316">Driver Training <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>Yunfei Company is extremely careful in selecting drivers. Therefore, its restrictions are very strict. The Yunfei Vehicle Affairs Office knows that the issue of driver training should be given extreme importance. Therefore, it often gathers drivers at the head office to teach them all the knowledge about their work, explaining repeatedly and in detail. Each gathering has about fifty or sixty people. The main purpose of the conference room set up in the Yunfei head office is for training drivers. As for the main points of the training, safety is of course the highest principle. Therefore, all necessary knowledge about machine parts, as well as traffic rules and first aid knowledge, are all emphasized. As for being familiar with the routes and treating customers kindly and respectfully, these are even more essential conditions for being a Yunfei driver. In short, safety and service are the two major principles that Yunfei diligently trains its drivers in.</p>
<h3 id="e317">Retrofitting Airplane Tires <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>The number of Yunfei vehicles that have been retrofitted with Goodyear aircraft tires has now reached more than eighty. Retrofitting with new tires costs the company a lot, but for the sake of customers, the benefits are not insignificant. These new tires have a particularly large surface area and are extremely strong and superior, which is sufficient to increase the safety and comfort of passengers. Goodyear aircraft tires are the culmination of many years of experience and are truly worthy of being a guarantee of safety and comfort. Yunfei is willing to make huge sacrifices and resolutely retrofit them, based on the spirit of service and entirely for the benefit of customers.</p>
<h3 id="e318">Renji Road Branch New Building <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<h3 id="e319">Yunfei's Employees <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>Fourteen years ago, Yunfei had twelve cars, only twelve drivers, and only nine internal staff members, totaling about twenty people. But as of today, fourteen years later, there are 56 accounting staff, 93 telephone operators, 165 copper painters, 43 car washers, and 305 drivers, totaling as many as 662 people. Compared to the past, it is like the difference between heaven and earth.</p>
<h3 id="e320">Passenger Statistics <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>The total number of Yunfei passengers this year is expected to exceed 4.5 million. According to historical statistics, Yunfei Company's business has increased by about 32.5 times in fifteen years. In other words, the number of passengers increases by more than double each year, and the increase has never been interrupted. Among them, the increase was especially large between 1930 and 1931.</p>
<h3 id="e321">Uniform Pricing <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>What is the displeasure of passengers if they have to haggle over prices or argue over fares when hiring a car? Yunfei Automobile's price is three yuan per hour, that is, one yuan every twenty minutes. It has been implemented consistently and remains unchanged. This is the regulated price in Shanghai. Under normal circumstances, this point is not worth mentioning. But in the event of a major incident, such as after the January 28th Incident, Yunfei Company alone still adhered to the regulated price, not avoiding difficulties and dangers, and doing its best to serve all sectors of society, and never taking the opportunity to exploit them. This is commendable and worthy of praise.</p>
