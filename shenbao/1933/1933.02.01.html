<p>時評</p>
<h3>中美日英四角關係晦</h3>
<p>（一）中美兩國友善之前途</p>
<p>美國自去年六月民主黨與共和黨競選以來。其政綱多傾向於國内問題。對外交關係。民政黨未嘗有具體之表示。對遠東問題。尤爲糢糊不清。致當時一般推測。皆以爲如羅斯福氏一旦獲選。則北美合衆國對遠東外交政策。將根本發生變動。不過據已往歷史以推斷將來。即知民主黨外交與胡佛史汀生主義根本上並無二致。吾人試舉一九一五年日本强迫我國承受二十一條件要求時。適民主黨總統威爾遜當國。同年五月十三日其所致日本之通牒中。有</p>
<p>『凡有害於中國領土的政治的保全及普通門户開放之國際政策。因而中日締結任何協定。美國皆不能承認。』</p>
<p>歷今十七年並未變更。共和黨當政。雖集注全力於歐洲戰債之整理。然而歐洲諸國實已精疲力竭。除榨取殖民地及半殖民地以資培補之外勢難覓自行更生之道。美國即能支配歐洲。亦絶無多大發展。不過僅借此暫維現狀耳。是故自第二十六代總統羅斯福氏以來。即認今後世界之重心。將移至太平洋。一九二九年經濟恐慌爆發之後。歐洲形勢日非。美洲現狀亦難維持。雖屢有恐慌已達極底。今後將見轉機之種種估量而事實均一一證明其舛誤。惟遠東經濟情勢。縱使我國外受强寇之侵凌。内遭匪軍之蹂躪。人民逃死無所。農村日趨破産。城市逐漸衰落。然而人民忍苦茹辛之精力。與夫天然埋藏之豐富仍足以震驚世界且有轉換當前困頓局面之可能。故於如此破碎情形之下。美國對華輸出。一九三二年仍在二億六千萬兩以上。折合金圓。其數雖不及一萬萬美金。而實際上占對華輸入之首位。前途之守望。任何人均不能加以否認。中美兩國間關係之密切。僅以貿易而論。亦值得格外重視。但一九三二年較之一九三一年输出入貿易所以减少之原因。實由日軍無故侵占東北三省。復文砲轟上海。炸毁閘北吳淞。致使中國全部蒙受巨大影響。一般購買力。因此頽落。吾輩雖乏正確精必之統計。以意度之。當較往昔減低三分之一。以至於二分之一。此種損失。在我國固爲直接身受。即於我友好之鄰邦。亦何嘗不蒙間接之損害耶。日本之武力侵略。實屍其咎也。破壞太平洋上之和平者非他。即日本帝國主義者是也。美國對此無論就政治的立塲經濟的立塲。均不能長久容忍。最低限度。亦必堅持其『不承認（武力獲得）主義。』是以新總統羅斯福氏。現已非正式表明接任以後。並不變更胡佛史汀生以往之遠東政策。吾人於分理正義悉被鐵蹄蹂躪之餘。認美國此種舉動。實爲和平前途之曙光。亦中美兩國互相友善之基礎也。</p>
<p>（二）美日關係惡化</p>
<p>我國旣審知日本武力侵略之殘毒。其蠻横已不可以理喻。向國聯陳述希冀伸其寃抑。共維和平公道。徒以實力薄弱。當局者缺乏以鐵血答覆暴力之决心。故日本得肆其貪慾設使以往情形依然繼續。我國仍循「口頭抵抗實」</p>
<p>際退讓」之不策。則日本將加緊擴大其蠶食策略。先取𤍠河　東。次及河北山東。三五年之後。如能以武力渡過當前之經濟難關。榨取東北三省當源而成功者。則不難由長江流域延長至於菲利濱以及南洋其他羣島。實現其東亞門羅主義之迷夢。</p>
<p>在美國之意。以爲九一八事變發生以來。日本國民經濟之危機。逐漸展開。其農村負債一九三０年爲四十億日金。一九三一年爲四十七億日金。迄去年年底爲止。計其總數已超過九十億圓日金矣。至於國債亦與時具增。迄一九三三年一月已迫迫七十億。再加本年度塡補豫　不足之公債十億圓及外債在匯兌上之損失。實際國債總額。當在九十億圓日金以上。僅以侵略東北三省費用而論。過去一年又四個月時間。已耗去四億圓日金。今年至少亦需兩億。長此以往。疲弱之日本國民。勢將不能擔負。是故美國爲自身計。爲掌握太平洋上霸權計。似以坐待日本之自　爲上策。然而此種假定。僅有平面觀察。設使亂則東北三省相對穏定。不難獲得。至少彼可因而掠取軍需品之資源。以供將來對太平洋戰爭之用。</p>
<p>况日英之間。早已有確實諒解。證之西門袒日之論。與夫近日保證「國聯對且决不援用盟約第十六條。」及反對報告書中聲明不承認僞組織之傳言。則日本從此可以大膽侵略中國。有英國背後爲之援助。匪特助日侵華。甚且助日對美。以至於破壞遠東均勢。蹂躪世办和平。亦未可知。此種局勢。豈等待所能解决耶。恐愈等待而遠東將愈破壞不堪矣。</p>
<p>美日之關係如彼。英國之態度又如此。在美國尙有兩洋爲界。勉可自保。然對東方市塲。勢已不能不受日帝國之支配。我國此時縱能得美國之同情。但亦僅止於精神上之援助。是則實際的民族鬭爭。除由我國人拼鐵血努力自救外又寗有他法哉。</p>
<h3>美國海軍精銳太平洋大演戰</h3>
<p>～防備力之最大試騐～</p>
<p>～預定日期爲七十日～</p>
<p>東東日日新聞云、美國在太平洋大西兩洋艦隊、聯合海軍演習、業於要月二十三日開始實行、大西洋偵察艦隊、由克拉克提督指揮下、於二十三日由山台哥·山彼德羅·梅亞三根據地·向攻擊軍之根據地檀香山出發、此次大演習、以檀香山與美國太平洋岸一帶爲中心、美國海軍當局、所謂「美國之西海岸防備能力之最大試騐、」網羅海上艦艇百六十七隻、飛機二百五十架、及航空船阿克龍號等、即以檀香山之阿夫島、爲假想敵所佔領、舉行猛力攻擊、預定期限爲七十日、實行檀香山與美太平洋沿岸一帶之洋上大戰、至於太平洋之攻擊軍、以大西洋艦隊爲主體、組織黑色艦隊、企圖佔領太平洋岸之一部、二十三日由山彼德羅軍港、派巡洋七隻與航空母艦雷克新登號、又由山台哥·梅亞·兩根據地、派航空母舡薩拉德加號以下十二隻驅逐艦、向檀香山出動、以上三艦隊集合於洋上、一月三十一月抵檀香山、即組成黑色艦隊、預定二月六日、奪取美國西海岸之山彼德羅·山台作戰行動、同時防守西海岸爲青色艦隊、阻止黑色艦隊之行動、並加以反擊、力圖全滅該艦隊之作戰、使用潛水艦飛機與近代的武器、偵察黑色艦隊之行動、又聞美國聯合艦隊司令官爲雷依提督、雷令新巡洋艦隊、常川駐泊山彼得羅、此艦隊即以大西洋艦隊中由七隻六時砲巡洋艦所編成、隸屬於太平洋戰鬥艦隊之一部、俾可增加太平洋艦隊之戰鬥力云、</p>
<p>路透社三十日火奴魯魯電云、美國海陸軍會操、今日正式開始、其中一部分爲進攻火奴魯魯動作、故達虎島上之防軍、今日準備一切、所有設防區域内之砲口、悉移向海面、以備此後兩日内攻軍來襲、星期五日防軍萬人由營調出、分佈於險要各地、其所携砲位、悉有掩護、雖相距數碼、亦不知其所在、並在各要點安置最新式之高射砲、聞其射力甚强、可使敵機不能低飛、而喪失其投彈命中之效力、此次會操之準備、衆信可表明趨向、美國太平洋濱之敵艦隊、能否在太平洋之中摧毀美國防禦堅固之地位、今年火奴魯魯方面之操演、歷時頗短、但可視爲重要、美國軍事專家確信敵人之來攻美國西海岸者、决不能置珠港根據地於其後、而不防備之蓋美軍可從珠港出發、對於敵軍甚長之交通線作有效力之反攻也、</p>
<h3>日英兩國經濟予盾</h3>
<p>九一八事變後、我國抵制日貨風潮甚盛、故日商品一面隨軍隊深入東三省各地、軍用品運往東北甚巨、一九三二年中之日本對外貿易、東三省竟增加百分之三、此三年來之地位如左、</p>
<p>％</p>
<p>一九三０年　五·九</p>
<p>一九三一年　五·七</p>
<p>一九三二年　八·九</p>
<p>在東三省之日貨、一九三一年比較一九三０年减進原因、爲萬寳山案受抵制所致、一九三一年入宼後、日貨隨槍桿直進以至今日、在吾本土日貨逐年减少、其實情如北、</p>
<p>％</p>
<p>一九三０年　二一·五</p>
<p>一九三一年　一六·八</p>
<p>一九三二年　一二·二</p>
<p>可見在此三年間减進了九·三％、即在華日貨减少總出口貨之一成、在中日紛爭摭大過程中、日貨身英國殖民地推進、在英屬馬來·印度·及濠洲各地、與英製品角逐、上年增進綿絲布類約在八千萬元、多在印度及右列各地·與蘭加夏製品大競爭、英製品遂一敗塗地、英國爲欲制勝於商戰、遂開渥太華會議、研究對策、提防日貨、對英貿易之地位列左、</p>

<p>％　％</p>
<p>一九三０年　四·一　一八·五　二二·六</p>
<p>一九三一年　四·七　二０·二　二四·九</p>
<p>一九三二年　四·二　二七·０　三一·二</p>
<p>足見日英貿易中、在英本土·此三年間並無甚變動、而英屬地之日英貿易、日貨進口數量、竟增日本金輸出之八·五％、可謂失之於華、得之於英、故英日之資本戰、從此更加猛厲、在此期間、中美日關係漸衰、其變遷如次、</p>
<p>％</p>
<p>一九三０年　三六·八</p>
<p>一九三一年　三九·四</p>
<p>一九三二年　三三·四</p>
<p>三年間减三·四％、一九三二年與一九三一年比較、則减六％、日貨在華美兩地、漸失其銷路、東三省各地、雖以槍桿推銷日貨、由大局觀察、所得未能償其所失、試看中國全國之日貨進口情形、便能了解此理、</p>
<p>％</p>
<p>一九三０年　二七·四</p>
<p>一九三一年　二二·五</p>
<p>一九三二年　二一·一</p>
<p>由商戰立塲觀察、日英間競爭甚烈、英國不能永久爲日本之良友、在馬來半島、日本爲欲推銷日貨、日商入鄕村與土人結託、領導土人組織合作社、全部銷售日貨、日方預以種種利便、由經濟關係、發生政治連絡、故英人對於日人舉動、甚爲戒防、我人從商戰逐漸引起日英之政治戰一點觀之、目前英國在政治上雖甚帮忙日本、然此種空氣在裏面逐漸醖釀起來、可决英日不能爲永久之良友、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯三十日柏林電　新總理希特勒向國社黨發表佈告、宣稱、國家主義各政黨及團體今已聯合、共同鬥爭、以謀德國之復興、並謂國社黨人對於其所負之鉅大責任、已獲得成功、結　中則要求黨員信任希氏、俾彼具有力量、得依榮譽自由及社會和平之基礎、以再造德國云、</p>
<p>國民社三十一日柏林電　現信德國成立新混合政府之後、將有若干財政與政治改革、惟據希特勒總理之發言人聲稱、當不致有激烈而足以引起優亂之變更、而希氏亦將遵照法律、憑籍理智、統治國家、聞此次各閣員除司法外、悉於發表希氏組閣消息以前决定、惟司法現猶空懸將待中央黨决定是否參加後、再行委派、國會常務委員會今日開會、决定至遲於二月七日召集國會、新政府將於此日向國會宣布大政方針、至軍縮會代表今日已發表、將由國防總長白洛堡親自担任、</p>

<h3>中央黨採觀望態度</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯三十一日柏林電　新總理希脫拉、於今晨與中央黨領袖卡斯主敎會商、俾至少可獲得中央黨對於政府之容忍態度、據中央黨機關報「日耳曼尼亞報所述、該黨目前並不與政府爲難、但正期待政府之行政大綱、再行决定、因此中央黨或將暫時採取觀望態度、對於希特勒巴本聯合内閣暫予容忍、以故衆院中提出不信任政府案時、該黨不參加投票、國社黨中某方面、主張立即解散衆院、以舉行新選舉、蓋希特勒取得政權後、對於民衆印象甚深、因此或可使該黨吸引若干新選民地、但政府意見不以爲然、以爲衆院即不信任政府、亦不必舉行改選、因衆院解散之後、政府對於新選舉一事、仍可無期緩期也、</p>

<p>國民卅一日柏林電　夜間除柏林·哈爾·杜塞爾道夫三處、有共産黨與國社黨小起衝突外、尙稱安靜、柏林最嚴重之事端、爲國社黨挺進隊一支隊經過共黨員聚居之區時、曾遭槍擊、死警察一人、挺進隊隊員一人、當挺進隊開槍回擊時、重傷共産黨員數人、京中之勞工區幾寂無行人、顯因工人皆居家靜待店夥開會之結果消息、共産黨豫料星期一日時事之變化、故於星期日已召集店夥會議、與會者有柏林各大商店之代表二千人、内有社會民主黨員及獨立工團團員若干、演說者與所通過之决議案、皆言社會民主黨與共産黨之合作、爲當務之急、經激昂之辯論後、以大多數通過决議案、主張立即籌備總罷工、左翼兩黨應定共同之戰線·並舉定執行委員會、内有共産黨七人、社會民主黨八人、担任指揮共同活動事宜、該會議終止後、其所通過之决議案、一時如野火之焚燒、傳偏勞工區、獨立觀察者雖不否認工界有激烈之傾向、但信社會民主黨　决計靜待國會之發展、以定方針、並反對操切行事、社會民主黨向來之紀律　當能阻止黨員附從共産黨、但政府方面似已决計竭其精力、以處置總罷工之舉、</p>
<p>路透三十一日柏林電　共産黨機關報紅旗報今日以大字標題曰、「出戰」明白對希特勒政府宣戰、該報請社會黨各團體悉參加總罷工、並披露工團領袖二千人開會所通過之决議案、内稱、希特勒在吾人總罷工之威力下、秘遭失敗、如一九二０年加浦政變之瓦解云、</p>
<h3>各國報紙論調一斑</h3>
<p>路透社三十一日倫敦電　英國今晨報紙皆評論德國希特勒任總理事、承認國社黨領袖宜有組閣之機會、並謂德國國會之前途、繫於希特勒之建設力、晨郵報及每日電聞對於希特勒任總理之能否成功、表示疑念、謂國權黨之領袖胡根堡與前總理巴本皆將利用時事、以達其國權主義之目的、每日電聞並謂希特勒僅代表德國於國會德謨克拉西制失敗後之有病態的反動耳、泰晤士報稱、此後最近之時事、將視新张畀與天主敎各政黨談判之結果而定、但希特勒之嘗試、他國將加以大注意、尤以波蘭與法國爲甚、同時英國將以懷疑態度、注視德國關於軍縮之態度、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社三十日巴黎電　各大日報爲長文評論德國政局「巴黎回聲報」謂、法德接壤之國、而其政治一則右趨於國家主義派、而主張報復、一則左趨而主張即時裁兵、此兩種相反之聲調、同時放響、實可駭異云、（按即德國内閣右傾法内閣左傾之意）「小巴黎人報」頗以德内閣份子之配合爲異、謂舉凡德國反對共和之人物、悉爲新閣所羅致、希氏此種試騐、殊爲嚴重、「小日報」謂希特勒之友黨、以總理一席讓於希氏、實爲利用希氏之最良方法、「日報」則謂「失敗常伏於勝利之中、希特勒當能了解也」云、</p>
<p>路透社三十日羅馬電　希特勒政府之成立、頗爲意國所歡迎、墨索里尼機關報意大利日報稱、希特勒自其運動開始以來、即奉墨氏爲模範、並認法西斯主義爲其應採之政策、許多意人預料希特勒必能爲德國組織强有力的統一政府、而使德國在國際事件中爲人所重視、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社三十日南斯拉夫京城電　此間報紙視希特勒之登臺、爲德國舊帝國主義之捲土重來、頗爲憂慮、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社三十日維也納電　希特勒之登臺極爲奥國人士所注意、蓋德國國家社會黨之勝利、不免在粤國發生重大影響、左派報紙深恐奥國之國家社會黨、將因希氏之勝利而死灰復燃、故論調甚表煩躁、對於德國前途亦作悲視、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社三十日華沙電　各報評論希氏登臺、甚爲興奮、「每日畫報」謂、「内亂之空氣、籠罩德國矣、」「波蘭日報」則謂希特勒不能成功云、</p>

<p>先烈陳英士長子駛夫、於去年九月九日、在杭州　橋、駕駛練習機殞命軍政部長何應欽等、於上月十八日、曾發起在貴州路湖社、舉行追悼會、當時即由中央監察委員吳稚暉·市長吳鐵城·市商會主席王曉籟·市敎育局長潘公展·等提議、設紀念品、募捐購置戰鬥機一架、定名爲『陳駪夫號』即由到會各代表爲發起人、以留紀念、經一致贊同、並即委托湖社全禮社員、爲勸募紀念陳君駪夫購置戰鬥機委員會、籌備委員、華東社記者、昨晤該會籌備委員包句香氏、據談、此事刻已從事進行募捐等章則、所有緣起、業已由潘公展及沈由莘兩氏擬就、經常務會通過、俟不日召集執行會時、即提出討論、從事募捐購置云云、茲錄其緣起如下、陳君駪夫、爲革命先烈英士先生之冢子、生而夙慧、幼即懷奇、去年一二八之變、憤國防薄弱、矮宼侵凌、非有空軍、不足禦外患、乃投考覓橋航空學校、預謀將來爲國效力、以繼父志、而達報國之願、不意於入學第二日、隨石敎官曼牛駕機練習、慘遭非命、壯志未酬、身已先死、深可痛惜、同人等鑒於近今榆關要塞、又遭蹂躪、暴日兇燄、愈形顯著、益感空軍之急需、爰機一架、以誌紀念、而慰忠魂、諸君子愛國熱忱、不後於人、况值茲國難未已、自必樂從、務祈慷慨解囊、盡量捐助、俾得集腋成裘、早日實現、行見飛鷁天空、驚破敵人之膽、黃龍痛飮、徧開革命之花、名傳千古、事等題橋、聲聞五洲、志同愛國、是則此舉也、固不獨烈士之英靈、得稍慰藉、即國人之意志、亦聊堪表現矣、是爲啓、</p>
<h3>中航公司滬平綫昨晨開始搭客</h3>
<p>滬漢綫搭客郵件均擁擠</p>
<p>國民社云、中國航空公司滬平綫、上月間開航後、運載郵件、試行結果、成績頗佳、本定二月一日起開始售票搭客、但前晚已有一外人名路易斯、前往該公司要求購買赴平、公司當即接受、搭乘昨日晨六時五十五分由機師安利生駕駛之十二號機飛平、同時並載郵件三·六二二公斤、至滬漢機、昨晨八時、亦由機師史密司駕四號機飛漢、其中我國商人搭客二名、郵件五·八二八公斤、據該公司李秘書云、每多不敢搭乘、現在搭乘者、已日有增加云、</p>

<p>今日入京</p>
<p>中央社記者、昨晨訪中委伍朝樞博士於其寓所、談話間頗多關係最近國際問題之意見、茲分誌如次、</p>
<h3>委任統治</h3>
<p>據伍氏云、在南太平洋中有若干小島、向隸屬德國、雖無豐富之出産、但地處海道衝要、極爲重要、自歐戰結束後、列强在和會中、即將备國海外殖民地瓜分割據、該區小島、由國聯委任日本統治、並由國聯規定委任統治地條例、其主要爲在委任統治區内、不得佈置軍事設備、自日本接管後、因礙於上述之規限、乃將該委任統治區内各港口加以改良、自前年東省事件爆發後、國聯得到日本在該區内佈置軍事設備之報告、在未曾查明眞相前、自不便有所論列、如果屬實、此乃日方顯然任意破壞國聯規約、危害遠東安寗、敢信國聯有權撤回其委任統治、如日本退出國聯後、其委任統治地是否亦因之撤回、此乃一極費詳細研究之問題、因尙無先例可參證也、</p>
<h3>日俄形勢</h3>
<p>日本攫佔東北後、即極力擴張勢力、使蘇俄有戒心、利害衝突、自屬難免、但觀察蘇俄態度、頗能忍耐、似不欲因此發生意外變化、但今後兩國間之趨勢若何、當看㈠日本侵佔中國之程度如何、㈡蘇俄忍耐至如何程度、㈢蘇俄本身利益被日侵犯至如何程度爲斷、</p>
<h3>美俄復交</h3>

<p>巡捕王偉桂捕盜殞命</p>
<p>兩盜匪被巡邏隊擒獲</p>
<p>昨晨二時許法租界敏體尼蔭路大世界圍牆外、忽然槍聲大作、一般居民、初尙疑係舊歷新年燃放爆竹、毫未介意、繼而呼盜之聲、勢如鼎沸、馬路上秩序大亂、始悉劇盜開槍拒捕、結果一華捕頭部擊中一彈、腦漿迸裂、送入醫院、未幾即斃命、兩盜當塲被擒、茲將詳情分述於下、</p>
<p>黑弄内盜匪剥衣　住居法租界白爾路福興里一號向爲　莊生意之無錫人朱春林、年二十七歲、前晚因爲舊歷新正初五日（俗呼財神日）、朱遂約同同居之邱金昌兩人至大世界游戲塲游玩、直至昨晨一時許始興罷賦歸、詎行經格洛克路殺牛公司後面黃河路口、突由黑弄内竄出三匪、二穿長袍、一御西裝、西裝者袖出手槍、向朱恫嚇、當將身上所穿之灰色華達呢夾大衣一件、大洋一元二角、刦奪以去、</p>
<p>西裝盜背後開槍　三盜得贓、由敏體尼蔭路向北而去、但朱遭刼後、心有不甘、卽暗中躡尾其後、當時因時届深夜、沿途不見一搏、直尾至法大馬路黃金大戲院側門前、始見有麥蘭捕房第六一四號華捕鹽城人王偉桂·（二十九歲）在該處上差、朱卽趨前報告、該捕聞報、當卽奮勇上前攔住去路、加以檢查、詎王捕正搜索第一盜時、而殿後西裝之盜、竟突出手槍對準王捕開放一響、彈中該捕右而額角、應聲倒地、</p>
<p>一盜終被捕追獲　王捕倒地後腦漿迸裂、一息奄奄、三匪卽乘隙沿公館馬路向東奔逃、斯時捕房特别班巡邏隊適率大批探捕在該處檢查行人突聞槍聲、知有變故、亟循聲趕到、瞥見兩匪正亡命奔逃、遂四面兜捕一齊拔出手槍向兩匪追擊、結果、追抵西新橋街口、一盜被擒、帶入捕房、受傷王捕、立卽車送仁濟醫院、因腦壳已碎、抵院卽斃命、</p>
<p>西裝盜終落法網　截獲之匪、帶入捕房後、經嚴詰之下、供名余庭榮、年三十三歲、寗波人、並供出同黨匿跡西自來火街九十六號四明大旅社五樓五十四號房間、當由特别機關督察員金九林·正探目張子權·包探張道貴·蔡綿章等趕往搜捕、果將西裝之匪擒獲、據供名鄭子明、十九歲、甬人、並在房内抄出六輪手槍一支、子彈四十二粒、槍管内尙留有新放痕跡、一併帶至捕房收押、</p>
<p>兩盜解法院研訊　華捕王偉桂、在院殞命後、由捕房派探王立成將屍身昇入同仁輔元分堂檢屍所、至上午十一時、捕房將余鄭兩盜、解送第二特區法院、由王網煦刑庭長升座刑一庭提審、先由捕房律師姚肇第起立、陳述案情、并稱本案尙未偵查、請求改斯、復將手槍子彈贓物大衣呈案、繼由事主朱春林陳訴當時被刦情形、訊之第一被告余庭榮、直認與鄭犯及在逃之唐阿五等三人路刦不諱、並開槍拒捕擊斃華捕王偉桂是實、第二被告鄭子明、亦直供因當時情急、由唐阿五命彼開槍轟擊巡捕、意欲嚇退衆人、事後卽返至旅館將手槍藏在房内、正要逃逸、詎甫行至二樓、卽被包探拘捕等情、</p>
<p>巡捕慘死之相騐　王誖長復問手槍從何而來、答是唐阿五給我的、王庭長核供、遂諭還押、改期至二月廿一日續訊、并由總巡捕刑　事科報請第二特院、委派鄧葆蓀檢察官於正午十一點半時、偕法醫姜璿·書記官彭　蒞所騐明尸體、升坐公案、據包探稟明前情、繼由尸父王谷生投稱死者是我兒子、慘遭盜匪擊傷身死、求請伸雪、鄧君得供、諭騐得王偉桂委係生前被盜開槍繫傷腦部身死、尸體准由尸父具結收殮、捕房騐畢、由將尸身拍照後、由屬收殮、</p>
<p>捕房將死者厚䘏　查王捕闓家住居曹家灣慶安里十四號、生父王谷生、年近古稀、所賴死者生活、今見事慘遭非命、哀痛欲絶、王捕入捕方服務、祇有年餘、辦事甚稱努力、此次因公捐縐、捕頭異常痛惜、聞除先行集資、給家屬趕辦喪事外、並已呈明總巡、從優議䘏、以慰死者、而示來茲、</p>

<h3>中國的病在那裏？</h3>
<p>｜沈祖光君來信｜</p>
<p>現在的中國政治組織，不用說是無希望了！但是無希望就算了嗎，這未免看中國人太輕了；然中國人到這個地步，還是沉沉鼾睡，所以我們天天極想摩拳擦掌，爲國家幹一下子。但是我們想，几事「豫則立。不豫則廢。」中國改革廿二年，結果總是弄不好！就是中了「凡事做起來再看」的毛病。所以我們的意思，不作則已，如果要作，對於中國如何作法？這一個問題，非先研究有系統有條理不可。我們有一個前提··如何呌做是好國家？好政府？我的答案··很平凡，就是「國内人人安居樂業」八個字。我們精細想，國之所以立，是由人的；人的所以存在，是要生活的。如今中國弄到這個樣子，就是中國人人不能生活，這就是不能安居樂業；人人不能安居樂業，就是政治組織不好；然政治組織怎樣纔能夠得上稱好哩？這是一個問題。廿二年來，中國政治上各種制度都嘗試遍了，結果無一是行的；本來一國有一國的歷史人情風俗習慣；滿聯邦共和也，英日君主立憲也，各國之國體不同，是好比斧斤椎鑿之各有所施，求其合於國情和於風俗就好了，何必從人。我的朋友有爲大學敎授的，有爲新聞記者的，年齡都在三十光景，我問他··中國政治究竟是共和民主好呢？還是君主立憲好呢？他們意思多說··不管那一個制度，只要人人能安居樂業，共和也好。君主也好。我想大家贊成共和民主，無非爲了民權二字；照現在看來，民權在那裏呢？生命財産都不能保障！還說民權。大家不承認君主，無非爲了君主生殺予奪，就一個人意思，是不照法律的。但我就歷史上看來，君主的生殺予奪，只對那任官受祿的一班人，或許有之；其實任官受祿的人，若一放任，便如山東韓劉，四川二劉，打起來了｜若君主於人民，甚至處一死刑，都是非常鄭重！（如前清虞决都經過好幾級詳訊這是我聞老人說的）决不像現在動不動，殺一個人連狗都不如！尙成什麽世界？中國若是君主立憲，算不定歷年及現在之軍閥交鬥可以少見些？我又想··凡是有權的組織，不管他大的小的，我以爲獨裁制度好。美雖共和，但他的總統，是里尼，俄之斯太林，都是獨裁化，現在那班大人先生，高其民治主義，都是野心勃勃，拿來給自己利用的。民治若無領導人，尙成什麽樣；子旣承認領導人，就不能不崇拜英雄了！我的朋友所以贊成君主立憲，也有他的見地··以爲君主是虚君政體，立憲是有國會的人，比你現在没有憲法！人民不能開口！總好點。我又記得洪憲失敗時，楊度有一個引咎的電報，他說··君主立憲，倡自楊度；君主君罪，罪在楊度。他又說··民舉總統，五年一任，就是五年一亂。總統時代雖不長久，但他的說話，很有點理由。若照現在情形不處，革命，革命，把人民的命，把國家的命，都革光了！這眞是痛哭流涕無可告訴者也！我們這番話，先生聽進聽不進，我不知道？也許先生說我們開倒車？我想政治制度，無絶對好壞的，完全在人治之耳。故楚莊王任孫叔敖，齊桓公用管夷吾，漢高祖信張良陳平，皆得覇王於天下。所以荀子說··「法者治之具，而非制治清濁之源也。」此是承認人治，不是承認法治。梁啟超著「倫君政民政相　之理。其言曰··」吾中國二千年免於變多君而爲一君者，其國必驟强。昔美之三十七邦也，德之二十五邦也，意之廿四邦也，日本之九十二諸侯也··當其未合也，彼數國者曾不克自列於地球也；其旣合也，乃各雄長於二洲！何也？彼昔者方罷敝其民，以相爭之不暇，自斷其元氣，耗其財力，以各供其君之私欲；合而一之，乃免此難，此一君世之所以爲小康也。」使梁氏此言是對的，那麽君主立憲，當然是合理的！聯邦制度是與他的主張衝突了。先生高明，尙請敎之。</p>

<h3>上海籃球會</h3>
<p>滬江勝華東</p>
<p>五十比二十八</p>
<p>大同克夏光四六比二九</p>
<p>今晚南星對青光</p>
<p>昨晚上海籃球會之興趣、集中於滬江與華東之戰、中華籃球房之觀衆、亦較見踴躍、但比較之差、出於意外、結果滬江竟以五十比二十八勝、且上半時華東僅得八分、滬得二十三分之多、另一塲甲組夏光因人馬不齊、爲大同所挫、比數係四十六比二十九、今晚甲組、僅南星對青光一塲、秩序如下、</p>
<p>藥光對非非　乙二　五時半　陳富章</p>
<p>靜光對慕爾　乙三　六時半　陸鍾恩</p>
<p>友愛對梁溪　乙一　七時半　樂秀榮</p>
<p>南星對青光　甲一　八時半　李祖祺</p>
<p>大同與夏光之戰、事前之預料、以爲夏光可操必勝、不料夏光威風銳减、戰力軟弱、良以人才不齊所致、而火同則青出於藍、球藝蒸蒸日上、交綏之下、形勢懸殊、上半時之比數、相去一倍、大同以二十二比十一勝、結果爲四十六對二十九、大同韓維新獨得二十五分、頗非易易、</p>
<p>滬江隊現屬於東華足球會、惟隊名則仍延用滬江、因註册處手續關係、尙未便允其改名、該隊自吳國霖離滬後、中鋒一職、由陸鍾恩代替、實力並不稍差、華東隊以持志球員爲主體、但昔日威風、而今安在、不免存滄桑之感、開始接觸、華東曾以四比零佔先、但從此紀錄停頓、鮮有建樹、滬江則節節進攻、極爲順利、上半時反以二十三比八之大差、屈伏華東、下午時之形勢、較爲緊張、表演亦多精彩、華東嚴加防犯、錢鼎愼得分頗多、滬江乘勝餘威、不稍示弱、分庭抗禮、各有建樹、結果滬江則以五十比二十八勝、</p>

<h3>金融美有發紙幣訊</h3>
<p>金價小挫三兩三錢</p>
<p>整天地徘徊在七百八十兩外</p>
<h3>全市略</h3>
<p>自前日略高後、昨市則見下降、蓋前日雖漲起三兩、然較之封關四天中、銀市跌勢相去極遠、故前收人心卽看銀市必升、昨電倫敦大條近遠期俱漲一二五、英美美英兩匯兌俱升半分餘、紐約銀價長三七五、五金交易所遠期銀價漲上五厘至四厘不等、美棉雖降十餘磅音、但銀行私電報長三七五、是以金市初開略低、爲七百八十四兩五錢人心極好、哄至七百八十六兩、然匯市仍硬、華比首出三月份美金二十八元六二五、又花旗亦售同月份六八七五、乃轉下游、匯豐掛牌英平美長一二五、比時金價已跌至二兩光景、是以不見動靜、更因五月份美金做至七五、銀行陸續出來、而跌爲八十一兩、但人心仍穏、買户亦湧、遂見拉上、入後因中央銀行開現數次、而升爲七百八十六兩九錢、無如銀行始終居於賣出頭櫬、三月份六八七五仍有出來、退至八十四兩一錢午收、下午初尙平靜、入後漸見賣方活動、曾跌至八十兩零六錢、蓋三月份美金仍做七五也、銀行胃口漸見納進、金價乃屢見起仆、中央銀行雖有兩度開現之訊傳來、但亦未見證實、價乃向榮、更聞中央銀行二珦半似肯開現、曾哄至八十五兩、無何美國有將發紙幣之訊傳來、金價又見磨折、瀉下二兩餘、入後市况趨平、徘徊於二三兩之間、最後以七百八十二兩七錢收盤、一日間市况盤旋、人心穏定、掉期貼價略小、爲七錢、成交不多、今將前後兩市情形、分誌於左、</p>
<h3>早市波折</h3>
<p>晨開爲七百八十四兩五錢、雖較前收跌一兩五錢、然人心甚好、永豐雖售、但購者頗湧、自四兩至五兩間、略有起仆、恒餘來進、好至五兩外、福餘日昌進至八十六兩二錢、顼興脫售、爲五兩、兆豐昌亦出、福餘雖購、亦不見漲、蓋華比售出三月份美金二十八元六二五、恒餘賣至四兩光景、乾昌祥永豐亦出、爲八十三兩内、略有數錢回上、而匯市續硬、花旗更出三月份美金六八七五、福餘忽來賣出、五月份美金已做至七五、乃降至八十一兩、大德成買進、乾昌祥亦購、升爲二兩、慶發永來售至一兩二錢、略有數錢徘徊、福興永上塲進條、而爲二兩八錢、華比來塞三月份美金七五、金價又通至二兩内、匯豐掛牌英匯不動、美金長一二五、未見若何刺激、但人心仍好、大德成購買、永豐兆豐昌雖出、而價反漲、華比忽吃本月份六二五、乾昌祥亦進、乃至三兩半、物品套出、而乾昌祥仍續見進條、價乃得以站住、花旗扒四月份先令二五、福餘恒餘相繼來進爲四兩半、源茂永進至四兩八錢、瑞興進至五兩二錢、華比出三月份六八七五、志豐永脫手、爲四兩光景、逐漸盤小至三兩内、蓋慶發永仍出也、福餘稍買、而回至五兩外、散户心理堅定、德康鴻康永尤爲力購、而爲三兩八錢、大德成乾昌祥兆豐昌等俱進、乃聞中央銀行開現二百十條也、升至五兩外、恒餘亦進、漲爲五兩半、中央銀行續有開現之舉、大德成恒餘等又購、乃好至八十六兩九錢、無似銀行仍塞、華比出三月份美金六二五、恒興者昌祥來售、退至五兩半而略靜、花旗更出同月份六八七五、金價略瀉、爲三兩八錢、未幾进收爲七百八十四兩一錢、物品拍三兩八錢、</p>
<h3>後市平凡</h3>
<p>下午開盤七百八十四兩三錢、市况平靜、旋爲四兩五錢、乾昌祥來售、乃退至四兩内、華比又出三月份六八七五、順利稍出、爲三兩光景、略有徘徊、此後同行中傾售、匯票三月份美金已做到七五、志豐永來出、散户心理稍疲、羣起跟風、乃降至八十一兩、福順等來進、抬至二兩半、興業塞出三月份美金七五、福餘前來脫售、降至零七錢、順利略進、爲一兩、旋又跌進一兩、而至八十兩零六錢、大德成來進、此後忽傳中央銀行開現、匯市略見起色、二月份美金六二五不易購得、乃好至二兩外、恒興來進、爲三兩、丙興亦購、志豐永則出、爲二兩半、萬興亦略見售出、至二兩内、此際忽上忽落者多時、中央銀行又有開現之訊報來、但未經證實、然聞如有二兩半之價、中央似乎肯納、人心又好、回到四兩外、源茂永來進、漸哄至八十五兩、大興永來出、退至四兩、美國發出紙輔弊之訊傳來、抬面上突現賣氣、但餘源康祥來售、降至一兩七錢、恒興忽來購條、賣風頓止、回上兩許、盤旋於二兩半及三兩之間、而未分升降、恒興代客忽出一百零五條、又跌至二兩内、而爲一兩六錢、大德成等又來購條、又至三兩外、蓋恒餘此時亦進、故價在三兩光景站住略久、宏利仍來售出、物品亦賣、爲二兩内、此後已近收市、成交不多、人心似穏、互有數錢進退、拖延至四時半爲七百八十二兩七錢收盤、物品拍三兩二錢、查一日間最高價七百八十六贱九錢、最低價七百八十兩零六錢、有六兩三錢差度、最後結果較前收跌下三兩三錢、</p>
<h3>開現活動</h3>
<p>中央銀行開現又活動、統計全市約共開現六百餘條、上午初開四兩半、計三百十五條、乃泰康潤大德成同豐恒等代做、又做五兩、計潤昌永一百零五條、同豐恒四十二條嗣後又聞開六兩、計二百十條、下午初開一百零五條、價一兩半、又一百零五條、價爲二兩半、但未經證實爲何號代做、</p>
<h3>少抑半兩</h3>
<p>揭價因掛牌美匯長一二五、計二十八元一二五、合金價八百五十三兩三錢三分、照收盤價言約撳七十兩餘、較前收少撳半兩、二月份登賬七百八十六兩、三月份登賬七百八十四兩、上午補水七百八十四兩、下午七百八十三兩、</p>
<h3>烚赤呆滯</h3>
<p>烚赤昨市略低、成交仍未見旺、塲内成交未滿百兩、計照加十兩零二錢半、較之前日略賤、僅由盈豐恒及大豐恒對做而已、趨勢似萎、然現貨並未見湧、故交易極不和、</p>
<h3>掉期靜止</h3>
<p>掉期極度靜默、蓋因頭寸不多、昨市上午未聞成交、各現貨號未曾落手、成交更少、下午稍見活動、瑞康（空方）以貼出七錢之價、向乾昌祥做過二月份掉至三月份、計三十五條、</p>
<h3>交易雜碎</h3>
<p>檯面上交易極繁、各號乍進乍出、複雜異常、約計恒興永豐瑞興慶發永兆豐昌宏利大興永等軋出、福餘乾昌祥大德成福興永元亨福順丙興瑞康源茂永等軋出、恒餘源康祥志豐永日昌等俱先進後出、大連帮萬興顺利俱時見少數出納、廣帮恒興上午稍出數十條、下午亦軋出數十條、此外零星而已、</p>

<p>～銀行扒塞都有～</p>
<p>～金業先進後出～</p>
<p>～結果俱見硬化～</p>

<p>（英滙）晨開近期出價一先令八便士一八七五、較前收略硬零六二五、華比售出三月份先令二五、（金業對做英美匯兌者）、孟買褒予大英現貨一八七五、匯豐亦出三月份二五、午收出價正月份與二月份同爲一先令八便士一八七五、三四月份同爲二五、五月份三一二五、下午安達售予華比三月份二五、麥加利出五月份三一二五、（金業對做英美匯兌者）、沙遜售予正金二月份二五、匯豐又出四月份二五、收盤出價二月份一先令八便士一二五、（或一八七五）、三四月份同爲一八七五、五月份二五、進價迭加零六二五、</p>

<p>一月三十日紐約電、今日國家五金交易所遠期銀價隨倫敦紐約現貨而漲四十至五十二個磅音、所中成交數共一百三十二萬五千兩、此種漲勢、爲勞勃脫漢乃先生之說帖所致、蓋該帖詳述大用白銀爲輔幣、可恢履世界經濟狀况也、</p>
<h3>洋厘頓轉高昂</h3>
<p>昨日洋厘早晨因市塲中無人供給、致買方欲買者轉覺苦悶、不獲已抬價買進、卒至收盤價較前日改好一厘半、爲七錢一分三厘七毫半、形勢頗爲堅挺、做出匯劃票欵早市八十六萬、鈔票五萬、塲外鈔票未有見聞、銀行支單四萬、銀行買賣互市四十五萬、銀拆仍爲白借、劃頭始終無加水、槪爲白劃、錢莊洋公單收解一百四十餘萬、銀公單收解四百八十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解五十餘萬、銀劃頭欵收解八十餘萬、銀行洋欵收解洋户往來僅二十餘萬、銀欵收解外商方面票欵收解五十餘萬、匯貨押雜各欵一百餘萬、結欵因月底關係、毠有一百三四十萬、進出倉平、華商各銀行收解票欵九十餘萬、匯兌貨物各欵收解均無收解、關稅欵僅六七萬、洋欵什欵等收解八九十萬、出倉二十萬、拆票交易約一百餘萬、小錢莊交易四十餘萬、輔幣江南小洋早市六錢二分、交易二千角、廣東小洋爲六錢一分、較前日突然高漲一分二厘半、交易六萬五千角、午市各價均無行市、銅元如舊仍爲四百十二千文、交易五萬一千餘串文、</p>

<h3>債市繼續上漲</h3>
<p>｜散户進胃甚濃···大户絶少賣出｜</p>
<p>昨日華商證劵交易所公債市面、並不因時局漸趨惡化而回跌、塲上交易雖不多、而散户零星買進、胃量頗强、惟以銀錢兩業、尙未有所舉動、遠道客帮、亦大都尙未蒞臨、頭盤比較略疲、但亦彼漲此跌、二盤仍一致回高三五角、交易則漸形减色、計上午兩盤、共計成交三百八十二萬一千元、午後仍無市、結果比前日略漲二三角至七八角不等、惟編遣現貨小六角云、</p>
<h3>紐約股市漲落不一</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週一（三十日）紐約股市、各股漲落不一、旋因十二月份鐵道報告良好、市况乃漸轉佳、後得希特勒爲德總理消息、德國公債驟形慘落、股市因亦略受不良影響、影片公司之合併傳說仍轉盛、福斯公司副總理希韓君現已起程往東方晤華納總理福斯君、凡麥因限止國外匯兌、丹幣克龍納跌九十磅音、本日成交數祇四八九、九九九股、茲將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<h3>外棉跌實需滯標紗步落</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、跌風漸熾、蓋以海外紗花狀况日下、棉市牽動、唇齒相依之紗市、亦摇動下墮、同時實需停滯、致人心極弱、但有一部份以時在春季、客銷當有不斷之望、對於多頭方面、仍不放鬆、然國難方殷、内地商業衰敗、銀根非常緊迫種種均予紗銷不利云、</p>
<h3>人標下降力漸强</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、外棉趨落、塲中買户缺乏、各月跌七八錢　益昶空額雖抵、散户仍出、市盤仍難維持、結果各月跌一兩二·四·五錢、午後聞實銷清滯、各月跌二·三·五錢、全日成交統計二萬零七百包、查賣出長豐一千九百包、義成一千零五包、椿記一千包、達記七百五十包、仁豐七百五十包、大昶六百包、愼記六百包、買進益昶一千六百包、是餘五百五十包、恒大五百五十包、裕康五百包、愼昌五百包、收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>現紗走動力驟弱</h3>
<p>現紗去化驟清、因原棉摇不辦矣、查全日各帮買去統計僅二百四十六包、行情跌五錢至一兩外、但三二支四二支紗線跌二三兩不等、各帮買額如下、</p>

<h3>印棉步廉美棉低整個的棉市爲之擊落</h3>
<p>棉市暴瀉狂落、形勢十分虚弱、因印棉售價廉宜、各洋行在市兜銷、市價較昨低七錢半、而美棉又跌十五磅音、致人心突起恐慌、整個的棉市爲其擊破矣、前途情形、須依美印棉市爲進退、</p>
<h3>鄭標狂落八九錢</h3>
<p>鄭標前午開盤、以美棉趨落、印棉價廉、多頭驚惶、跌風特熾、雖有空頭抵進、然頽勢仍難挽回、各月跌七錢半至六錢半、午後聞印棉有數廠做開、遠月又跌一·二·三錢、全日成交統計八萬一千九百擔、查賣出遠大六千一百擔、椿記二千五百擔、源興昌二千五百擔、明華二千八百擔、餘昶二千四百擔、仁豐二千八百擔、買進源大八千七百擔、瑞大三千二百擔、益昶二千五百擔、賡豐二千三百擔、長豐一千四百擔、新亨一千四百擔、收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>外棉做開者日多</h3>
<p>現棉廠需尙好、但外棉定價愈近、大有喧賓奪主之勢、故近日做開者日多、來源計姚花一千九百包平茄爾二九·七五緯通廠進八００件現貨卽裝船又　二九·七八　利泰廠進一、０００件又　又</p>

<h3>美英棉一致下跌</h3>
<p>昨日美棉因利物浦消息不佳及南方賣出、市况疲弱、計期貨跌九至十二磅音、現貨跌十五磅音、英棉期貨跌五六點、現貨跌七點、埃及棉現貨跌十三點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（三十日電）</p>

<h3>標粉廠客均有回出</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份又趨疲寂之態、以洋麥報價雖續好一角左右、惟實銷因舊歷年頭、多未交往、致銷塲停寂、異常乏神、在停市前雖現貨奇緊、目下則已鬆懈、且因洋麥兜售不出、信大等廠又微有出檔、致市氣步步下沉、而近更現粉軟弱、良因實銷不振所致也、兵船老車期現貨仍照準加七分半、雜牌加五分半、結果本月份較前日又跌二分二厘半、三月份跌二分半、四五六月份各跌一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>麥價步步下落</h3>
<p>｜籌碼甚鉅···欲守無從｜</p>
<p>昨日期麥續跌、洋麥報價、雖好近角、無粉銷不振、麥市遂亦萎靡不堪、以現洋麥定價仍低、此後到貨又可源源進口、行家手貨、雖目前仍欲擯守、無意抛出、不過籌碼甚巨、人心看虚、故成交清淡、價則步步不落也、結果本月份較停市前、跌七分、三月份跌四分、四月份跌三分云、</p>
<h3>福州帮續辦客米</h3>
<p>昨日客秈續跌一角、此價已可合划客埠搬販、故福州帮去胃突活、辦去二千包左右、泉州帮揀辦客元、而市上存到兩少、雖被帶小、但以脚地尙固、祇略疲數分、機紅米亦以貨少站住、統市由福州辦成江西機晚一千三百零六包、價九元一角半、九元零五分、中次自九元至八元八九角不等、又機紅米二百包、價八元七角半、湖南機油米七百包、價九元二角至八元八角七分、泉州辦去蕪機元一百四十三包、價千元零九角八分、又江西中次機元一百五十包、價十元零五角及十元、後市暫無佳望、因河下米昨日非正式在南市售開三船、價扯小一角、故人心虚軟、須客化活潑不絶、始有逐次轉好也、</p>
<h3>雜糧平定無進展</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧市勢平穏、做開丁家州黃豆千包、大生日經</p>
<h3>（一）開塲白柳</h3>
<p>「生意經」原爲做生意的一種經騐，也可說是一種訣竅，這一種訣竅，無非說是怎樣可使這注生意成功，這筆貨物出售。爲要達到這目的，所用的方法手段語言談笑，卽一般所謂「生意經」。</p>
<p>本欄沿襲這三字的用意，要將做生意的所用的「生意經」介紹於本報讀者。爲的是一般消費者，頗有一種同樣的感想，就是用物容易買物難。難的地方，卽爲與人生日用有關的商品不知多多少少，要知道這樣商品怎樣買法，頗非易易，卽本欄亦不能一一爲之解决，但如日常衣食所資的物品，能可爲之解釋一二，在消費的方面，已不無多少可藉以得到一些門徑，用以爲買物時的參考。那末，本樣之開闢，或不無與消費者以些須便利。</p>
<p>不過商品形形色色，不能一槪，舉一反三，仍在讀者，尤其是筆墨所能宣傳的，僅不過槪略之槪略，不周的地方，自所難免，如要加以擴充補正，還望讀者的贊助。至於本欄稿件，除向各業中人特約撰述外，仍歡迎投稿。㈠投稿以一種商品爲記述單位，不拘文言白話，每則以三四百字爲度，㈡投稿一經刋登，從優致酬，但版權卽爲本報所有，㈢如有一稿二投或抄襲陳稿，一經舉發查明，槪不致酬，㈣投寄之入，由本報隨時披露，不能限以時日，無論登載興否，槪不退還，㈤每稿須另開眞實姓名通信地址及印鑑或簽字式樣，㈥所投之稿遇有疑義，當函約投稿人來館面詢，不得拒絶，</p>
<p>連豆五車、乃爲内城及廣帮辦去、廠方仍不動、浦東杜豆本街進三百包、豆市前途、因各銷平常、如大連等市亦趨疲、故申市跌易而漲難、菉豆仍祇小呂宋及香港去胃、共成交管店大粒菜菉一百三十餘包、明菉二百包、江北菉豆爲厦門帮辦進、缸豆小呂宋採去二百餘包、芝蔴走化清淡、市勢軟化、紅糧江北帮辦取二百包、市尙穏立、生仁及花生交易雖接、然市因貨厚銷淡、形居軟勢、油市雖未正式售開、然市况恐須盤砌耳</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>茶棧方針無變動</h3>
<p>惟遂安一路已有數萬元放出</p>
<p>本埠路莊平水各茶棧、爲數不下二十家、關於金融之收放、營業之進出、爲茶業之總樞紐、去年洋莊紅綠茶、因内地茶價過高、滬市銷售、又有跌無漲、致各茶棧大多數稍受虧折、自總結賬後、日前如洪源承·源豐潤·忠信昌·永盛昌·永興隆·昇昌盛·公升永·等、均已先後確定本年營業進行方針、大致無甚變動、惟遂安一路、茶棧家注意者多、聞已有數萬鉅欵、陸續放出云、</p>
<p>粮市</p>
<h3>粗砂白劃價略跌</h3>
<p>昨日粮市以走銷尙未大動、趨勢略疲、公會劃盤二四號粗砂白劃十五兩七錢七分半比前日小二分半、二十號中砂白劃十五兩四錢、八九號荷赤劃十二兩四錢至三錢半、本廠棉白二號開十五兩三、三號十四兩二、廣帮號家開出片青三百包之譜、價爲八兩二錢至三錢、太古Ｂ嘜劃十六兩五錢半、本廠冰二號中袋開十七兩五錢、本廠小包冰一號開十七兩八錢、二號十七兩七錢、</p>
<p>潮帮兌規業已解决</p>
<p>潮帮號家與糖業各行、因改市秤問題、兌規均有變動、昨日雙方在南市老公會商洽之下、業已决定、祇須今日雙方通告同業、卽可實行、茲將决定各要點誌之如下㈠銀期　成交寫成票日起以十天爲限、㈡棧租　一個月後起算、㈢出貨以三個月爲限、必須出清、㈣火險以三個月爲限、（歸號方保、）㈤銀期到限先由行方將貨銀約付號方、再由號方將提單送交行方、㈥包皮規定每包二斤十二兩（市秤）</p>

<p>油市</p>
<h3>上年油麻營業之迥顧</h3>
<p>桐油苧麻一業、近四五年來、桐油一項漸見衰落、至上年而更甚、營業不及前年之增、推其原因、約有數端、距此二十年前、浙省金華·衢州·温州·嚴州·等舊府屬及杭府上游各縣、均開闢荒山、種植桐樹、迨近十年産額激增、素爲漢桐行銷之地、一變而爲出産之區、本埠油麻號家、素向漢口採辦、行銷江浙各内地城鎭、浙産發　積、價廉於漢、本埠營業漸爲所寗、先是浙銷雖絶、而本省各地尙可保持、蓋浙桐銷於蘇境、須加厘稅每擔七角二分、詎厘卡裁撤後、障碍解除、浙桐銷蘇、已通行無阻、滬上向藉洋關爲護符、轉銷内地者、已無所憑藉、營業生機、瀕陷絶境、此白桐油因受浙産激增及裁厘之影響、向以漢桐爲營業主體者、已侵奪無餘、然洪江桐油或可有一部分之保持、乃查洪桐油歷史、在厘卡未設以前、市面本集中於蘇州、其後因内地厘卡星羅　布、行商販運困難、而本埠適可憑藉洋關、輾轉銷運、市面卽漸移之滬上、已數十年於茲、乃裁厘後、蘇州洪江桐油營業、漸有蓬勃新興氣象、勢將恢復數十年前厘卡未設狀態、因苛稅解除、裝運已無阻碍、且蘇州處浙省杭嘉湖·蘇省蘇松常等處中心地點、松道交通四達、與滬上之僻處海濱、便利相去甚遠、因勢導利、宜有新興之形勢、由是而衡、本埠桐油事業已成强弩之末、斯亦市塲上之滄海桑田也、本埠油麻業上年營業、上半年因戰事而停頓、下半年雖可營業、然因受上述種種影響、營業範圍、侷促一隅、其衰落狀態、實達於極點、若不另謀企圖、勢將淘汰、深願從事斯業者、另闢蹊徑、以求出路、至於各號間有獲利者、係兼營麻類之家、故上年麻類尙可獲利、若專營桐油者、欲求盈餘、則十難得一耳、</p>

<h3>上海閒話</h3>
<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>美與醜</p>
<p>「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」，這是千百年前傳流的對於江南地方的讚詞，事到今朝，蘇杭二州的天堂地位已被上海侵奪去了，蘇杭雖有天然的風景，但終不及上海人工的美麗。</p>
<p>蘇杭二州的一切，都以上海化爲時髦，上海人却以西洋化爲時髦，决不屑去模仿蘇杭人的東西，蘇杭人都受上海生活，在上海做寓公久居不厭，上海人偶然到蘇杭去玩一兩天，就會感到生活上的不便，除了眞山眞水以外，一切的一切，都不及上海美！</p>
<p>上海眞是美的地方呵！尤其是夜的上海，人們陶醉在　紅燈光裏，仰首看了十幾層樓的高大洋房，就會覺得自己身體的渺小，靜安寺路，霞飛路等處，有多少闊人的别墅，從重樓傑閣，茂林修竹之中，透出一陣陣的細樂。遠遠望見一兩個摩登女郎在裏面或隠或現，眞似神仙中人，窮措大看了，心裏會生出種種遐想。</p>
<p>但是，上海有許多住在「夾縫」裏的人，我們若無透視的目光，就無法看見他們的侷促狀態，一樓一底的房子裏，住七八户人家，乃是極普通的事，當然的，樓上樓下都擠滿了床舖，而在地板與天花板之間，還能搭出擱樓來住人，這種人豈非住在房屋的夾縫裏嗎？你在寛闊的馬路上走着，怎能看見他們的生活？</p>
<p>上海宛如一個白磁的糞管，外表光潔，像白玉一般美麗，若把管子打破，裏面的黃白物流露出來，就顯得其醜無比！</p>
<p>毒門醫院的待診室裏，坐着一個美麗的女郎，身上穿得非常漂亮，臉上絶無瑕疪，少停，醫生敎伊脫開衣服，就看見伊渾身班點，段滿了楊梅毒瘡，上海的美醜也與這位小姐髣髴。以塗臉呢！」</p>
<p>我笑了。心裏想··北國的雪山裏，還流着戰士的血，像胭脂那麽紅，給中國少女們作化妝品很不錯哟！</p>
<h3>女人的紅緞袴</h3>
<p>— 顔波光</p>
<p>一九三三年的一月中，競尙自炫的幾個摩登姑娘燙了鬈曲的波紋美化秀髪，織細的畫眉，閃電般靈活的眼波，櫻桃般的朱唇，四尺餘長的旗袍，繡花邊的紅緞袴，黑漆　花的高跟皮鞋···伊走的曲折的藝術步履，出入於各大戲院影戲院。</p>
<p>伊這樣的裝束能救國嗎？能，伊在幾張極名貴的中國片裏，學到明星化的裝束的妖媚，也學到了花木蘭從軍似的英武。没有見伊荷槍，没有見伊出關殺賊，不，伊是以時髦救國。</p>
<p>艷麗的紅袴子，誘惑了西裝青年的追逐，沉醉在伊温暖的懷中，似鄒兒離不開保姆一般的需要，淺笑輕顰，他見了是多麽樂意。他贊美伊的秀髪說像一個</p>
<h3>放縱卑劣</h3>
<p>— 龐紫蘇</p>
<p>好像在二十年前，日本人曾以「放縱卑劣」四個字，贈給留學日本的中國學生，當時中國學生以爲這是莫大的恥辱，所以非常的憤慨。</p>
<p>然而，在二二年後的今日，怎樣？嘿··不是還在繼承着這一份「放縱卑劣」的老家業麽？</p>
<p>無徵不信，且看事實··</p>
<p>在馬路上行走的人，老是喜歡在路當中熙來攘往，好像是準備要和摩托卡拼一個你死我活。</p>
<p>火車站買票，戲院子看戲，上電車和下電車，總是彼此毫不客氣，後來的要爭先，先到的反而落後。</p>
<p>餐館裏必要喝拳猜子，才算盡興，必要杯盤狼藉，才算盡歡。</p>
<p>旅館裏打牌唱戲，通宵達旦，大家習以爲常，如果你不能入夢，而去勸他清靜些，他不但不道歉，恐怕反要說你干涉了他的自由。</p>
<p>街路上隨處看見的都是打架，閭巷間隨處聽見的都是詬誶聲。</p>
<p>信手拈來，已夠將中國的習慣太壞，不守秩序，不尊重别人的自由，···的種種劣根性全暴露了。朋友們！莫再繼承這一份「放縱卑劣」的才家業了罷！</p>
<h3>茺村讀雪</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>廢曆元旦，没有太陽，滿天堆着灰淡的雲。街上寂然。</p>
<p>惟有鎭西的古裏塲上，有農村男子在那兒賭錢，村姑們在那兒燒香。這個一</p>
<h3>狂歌當哭</h3>
<p>— 石予</p>
<p>｜弔岫巖凍死之鄧鐵梅部｜</p>
<p>昨讀鵑兄紫羅蘭盦談薈所載岫巖凍死之鄧鐵梅部三百八十人，死後猶手執槍刀，比之田横五百人，其義烈有過之無不及。蓋執千戈。衛社稷，與殉知己之一人有間也。并謂冀望文人學士歌詠之，以彰忠義，僕自愧不文，勉爲韻語寄投本欄。</p>
<p>冰闌百丈雪没髀，烈風刀割凍血紫，寒威酷虐同日僵，三百八十義勇士，岫巖困守鐵梅部，食盡衣單命已矣，魂魄不忘殺敵人，利器在手目直視，哀哉衛國好男兒，昊天不弔乃若此，當年荒島五百人，同時伏劍酬知己，壯烈猶流千古名，何况不爲一人死，無名英雄眞英雄，行心所安爲國耳，强敵萬騎重圍合，猶懼義軍堅抗抵，日久無聲搜入山，驚看數百僵屍體，虎狼殘忍亦嗟歎，知吾同胞齊揮涕，揮涕悲哀亦徒然，荷戈殺敵同奮起，寇深雄關已失險，眦裂問誰謀國是，</p>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>故鄉</h3>
<p>— 胡梯維</p>
<p>「現在幾點鐘了？」</p>
<p>紅葉聽母親說過，生病人頂怕問時辰，立刻直覺到病象不好，</p>
<p>「三點二十五分。」</p>
<p>「你去拿一枝筆一張紙來！」</p>
<p>紅葉不明白甚麽用處，也不敢問。提着筆對父親望着，同時感到有通知母親哥哥們起來的必要。</p>
<p>父親仍是闓上眼··『我自己想了兩句挽詞，你替我記下來，「夕陽知了，明月歸眞·」我死之後，Ｓ村的方老伯，是我們三代世交，一定來致唁。你可請方老件寫了，懸我靈佑。』</p>
<p>紅葉聽父親說完，涙珠已流濕了半張信紙。趕緊將母親哥哥仍喊了起來，一個個輕輕地掩入房中坐守着。一會，天亮了，母親呌紅葉去睏，紅葉不要。又守了兩個鐘頭，父親倒是呼呼的好睡。紅葉自覺有些熬不住，退出房睏到床上，腦海中只有「夕陽知了，明月歸眞」八個字，像怒潮般激盪着，也不知是汗是涙，流了一枕。</p>
<p>不曉得迷朦了多久，紅葉的哥哥來喊，說父親不好了，紅葉搶進房去，母親滿面流涙，握着父親的手··</p>
<p>「紅葉，父親的手都冷了，你喊一聲！」</p>
<p>紅葉一把捧住父親白髮盈顚的頭，附在耳朶邊，他流不乾的涙，滴在父親憔悴瘦削的頰上··</p>
<p>「爹······爹······」</p>
<p>可憐的父親，任憑紅葉喊破了喉嚨，他終不肯睜開他最後的一線的眼，他聽不見了！他看不見了！</p>
<p>故鄕，遠在六百里外的故鄕！年年到了這最悲痛最可紀念的一天，紅葉總是趕回去，到父親的墳前，磕一個恭恭敬敬的頭。在這短短的旅程中，吞白煤吐黑烟的特别快車，富貴蟲駐蹕的小旅館，沙帆殘月的Ｃ江，上窮碧落下及黃泉的長途汽車，還有，青青的山，欹危的城堞，富於技巧的酒罎山，表揚貞節的石牌坊，嚶鳴相求的蚊子，以及其他一切的一切！當然，還有慈愛的母親，友好的哥哥｜都年年無恙。只有那最動人的瘦削的兩頰，白髪盈顚的額角，黑皮拖芏裏兩支胖胖的脚，再也不見了！（完）</p>
<p>年一度的熱閙，照例會給勞働疲乏的鄕人湧起興奮快愉。</p>
<p>拉起大衣領，把呢帽埋在頭上，踅到這廟場時，北風刮得秃樹都大聲狂吼了。高樹聳着，没剩一片葉；柾枝微微顫抖，野地上的殘草。蒙蒙茸茸地鼓着黃色的波浪，我就立在這浪裏，聽風聲，我感到孤獨的寒冷。有一點嫉妬賭錢的，燒香的。</p>
<p>斷着，風聲像海潮，雲脚拖得更低，下雪了。粉似的，絮似的，落花似的，空間横滿了這一點一點的白魔鬼。立刻想到大清乾隆皇帝的詠雪詩··</p>
<p>「一片二片三四片，五片六片七八片，九十百片千萬片······」眞是對景生情的好詩。有着閒逸的心情看雪開始飛舞時候那樣欣快歡呼情調。紀曉嵐先生自以爲很聰明地收着末一句··「飛入梨花都不見，」其實覺不到甚麽趣味。單是要凑合古傳下來的所謂七言絶句，必需二十八字而已。</p>
<p>我也吟起后帝的好詩，一步一步回到家。滿身是雪了。</p>
<p>剛巧院子裏我的甥兒在捉雪花，凍紅了指畚進瓶裏，甕裏，紙袋裏··他一見我來，便笑嘻嘻地奔來對我說··</p>
<p>「舅舅，天公下着這麽多雪花膏，可女詩聖，伊的眼睛像影星葛來泰嘉寳。···他問伊爲甚麽穿着耀人的紅袴子？伊這樣說··「中國絲綢的衰落，都壞在你們一般愛穿西裝的身上，終日祇知穿漂亮的西裝，追逐少女，國家個個人像你們一樣，那得不亡國呢？我穿了紅袴子，是提倡絲綢救國，不是來迷人的。」他憬悟了，從此以後不用洋貨，不穿洋服，堅持的下了救國的决心。這是那個的功勞呢？</p>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>陶醉</h3>
<p>— 蘭光</p>
<p>這是半年以前的事了。</p>
<p>恬靜的空氣包圍着疫院的四週，病房裏放出慘藍的電光，穿過楣上的氣孔，身到登三樓的梯級上，幻成了一塊方斜形，忽然在梯頂上現出了一個安琪兒。伊那空着雪白的軟底鞋，那雪白的襪的小脚在長開縫的旗袍下擺動，身上披了一件銀色的大衣｜｜看護穿的外衣，伊那紅柔豐滿的兩頤，却有淺淺的渦兒，在淡藍色的燈光裏越顯得美，披着波浪形的髪，上面蓋了一頂紅十字的白帽，都含有可愛的潛力。</p>
<p>伊輕輕地踱過側門，走到病人的榻邊，那附着傷寒症的患者，却在和死神掙扎似的，不時的攀起他的四肢，眼睛一霎不霎地望着無力的燈光，在期待着與光一同消滅。伊略略地把氈被替他蓋好，慢慢地離了床榻走向那邊的梯旁去了。</p>
<p>在樓梯的一角伊不知在凝思什麽，突突的皮鞋聲開始在他的耳鼓上震動，原來他出自藥房，手裏拿着病人的名牌，還有一瓶泥醬般的藥水；他的眼仰視着伊的脚，不自覺地用力提起他的脚向上踏去。</p>
<p>大約還有三步模樣，後成起了一陣雜亂的脚　步聲，接着異口同聲地喊出··</p>
<p>「讓開讓開，病人來了。」</p>
<p>那是從鹽水間裏抬上來的病人，口裏不斷地喊着··「要吃西瓜，冰結漣，酸···梭梅湯」　　他急忙趨向角裏，伊亦不及躱閃，於是他的胸貼緊着伊的胸，他享受了一瞬間的幸運。伊臉上浮起一陣枚瑰色的雲，怱怱地轉向着牆角。他躬身抬起那已沾不鞋底印的散零處方紙。他慢慢地走進他的辦公室，坐在椅上，剛拿起鋼筆腦海裏浮亂着這一番回憶··銀白的衣，波形的髪，嬌艷的臉，尤其是酥温的胸，······他陶醉了，鋼筆脫離了手自桌上滾下，筆尖刺入板縫摇曳着。</p>
<h3>失眠之夜</h3>
<p>夜，悄悄地，靜默佔領了土地。散沙老人遺忘了我，我還睜大了眼凝望黑影中的輪郭。「怎麽還不入夢？」我惱了，翻個身，數着一，二，三，······但是依舊未見散沙老人的來臨。</p>
<p>看來入夢是不成了，我只得又睜大眼向黑暗中凝望。遠處的尖銳的犬吠，像深山裏狼嘷，使人心顫！</p>
<p>雜亂的思慮，像海潮般擁上心頭。</p>
<p>想着想着，心頭漸漸煩燥起來，於是决定不想，但是更多的思慮擁上來，好像在狠狠地說··「哼，看你逃得出我的擺佈。」</p>
<p>我默念着··「天呀，難道勞動一整理，連夜裏的頓熟睡還不允許有麽」；</p>
<p>桌上的小時鐘「釘釘」地響了十二下。</p>
<p>「呀，十二點鐘了。睡吧！明天六點鐘必得起來。睡遲了，做事要没精神」！這樣自語着</p>
<p>可是，思潮像野馬，更撒野了。想到了白天街上見到那個淺笑着的紅面頰的姑娘，想到上司那副鬼臉，想到了還在長生庫中的棉袍子，想到那土匪臨刑時的慷慨激昂，想到女人雪白的大脚，想到·····</p>
<p>桌上的小時鐘敲過了一點，又敲二點，三點思緒像亂絲一樣的亂。捱着捱着，不知捱過了多少時光，聽得又敲四點五點了，怎麽辦呢？等着等着，時間好像過得更慢了，雜亂　思慮也逃去了，只茫然地望着塗有些微薄光的窗。薄光慢慢增亮起來，總於到了晨曦時分了。不一會，鐘打了六下，於是勉强掙起這疲乏不堪的身子，幽嘆一聲··「唉，這一夜！」</p>

<h3>白雪的消融</h3>
<p>— 許傑</p>
<p>「落雪不如　雪冷，」這是經騐告訴我們的說話。</p>
<p>可是，今年的天氣，却大不如尋常了。在尋常，落了雪之後，在我們江南的天氣，便是不融，也不會堆積的，所以在融雪的時候，雖然冷，也冷得一個痛快，只是，在今年，這雪落下來，儘落下來，却一點不肯融去。好像這世界，永久便要這樣的被白色封鎖下去的樣子；而我們人類呢，也似乎卽日便右做泥潭裏的凍鯽魚的希望，會活活的凝凍在空氣的冰裏的樣子。啊！這樣下去，還成什麽世界！</p>
<p>幾天以前，因爲在白天裏還有人在生火取煖，有人要燒飯吃，甚至還有些人在談天，有些人在呼吸着的關係，我們的　前也曾經滴溜着初融的冰水。這冰水，無論牠如何的微細，但是，在我們，却也覺得恢復不少的生氣，有了不少的新生的希望。</p>
<p>我們明知道春天是要到的，但日日的看着這樣的冰凍下去，冰凍下去，把自己的肉體與靈魂都被凝凍在嚴厲的冰雪中，那日子是很不容易過的。忍耐着吧，是的，忍耐固然是我們中國人的處世金針，但這樣的情形，實在說，便是一刻，便是一分鐘一秒鐘，我們也忍耐不下的吓！</p>
<p>你曾經看見過用來鎭書或者厭紙的綵色的玻璃棒與玻璃球嗎？你曾經看見過在那玻璃球内凝凍住的脫眼金魚嗎？你曾經看見過在那玻璃棒内兩枝尾巴斜斜的剪着的燕子嗎？是的，我們的靈魂的被凍的神氣，正有些相像。</p>
<p>不過，這種情形，你或者還有能想像於萬一，因爲那只是好玩，那只是没有生命的由特質製成的美術品；那隻圓睜着兩眼終於不得動彈的金魚，與那對斜梭着燕剪終於不能飛去的剪燕，你們是不會把什麽同情寄托在牠們的身上，給牠們那没有生命的東西着急的。</p>
<p>没有辦法，我且再舉一個例吧！但是，我不曉得你們在兒童的時代，曾經玩過養小魚的把戲没有？不過，在我，我是有過這樣的經騐的。</p>
<p>在五六月的時候，我曾經在小溪裏捉回了許多小魚與小蝦，我因爲牠們活潑可愛，便把牠們養在家裏的一口小缸裏。我深恐牠們在我這頭，散放着許多翠綠的蕰藻，我讓牠們可以在假山的岩洞裏樓身，在大松一般的蕰藻蔭下遊嬉。我每天用飯米或是麥粉去侍候牠們，只要我把幾粒飯米撒入缸裏，牠們便會從水面的輕輕的一聲破碎的聲中，辨認出糧食已經到來，立刻從岩洞裏或是灆藻下跑來嗳食。我同牠們幾乎有了精神上的聯繫，幾乎把牠們當做我的生命的一部份。</p>
<p>可是，一直到了這一年的寒冬，有一天晚上，空中忽然發起西北風來，一切的水，一個晚上，完全變成了固體。當然，免不了的，我那個小魚缸，那個寄托着我的精神的一部份的小魚缸，也連根連底的凍起來了。第二天早晨，我急急的在寒風中跑去看那些小魚的時候，啊，那是何等傷心的事，牠們都一隻隻被凍結在整塊的冰塊裏面，與岩石，水草，一律的被冰結住了。呵，那是何等傷心的事啊！（未完）</p>
<h3>新年的新夢</h3>
<p>— 陽秋</p>
<p>「新」的「一九三二年」過去了，「舊」的「中華民國二十一年」也過去了，過去的一年，自然誰都不滿意，於是在這新年的開頭，每一個人又都做着新的滿意的幻夢。這，我們從高店門前所貼的「生意興隆通四海，財源茂盛達三江，」等等的春聯，以及書房裏所貼的「新年發筆，大吉大利，」等等的吉利話中，便可以明白地看出。</p>
<p>不過，「生意興隆，財源茂盛，」與「新年發筆，大吉大利，」究竟還只是以個人爲中心的「升官發財」的夢。而且這樣的「夢，」也似乎只是「但願如此，」還没有明白地顯示出「爭鬭」的意味。</p>
<p>時代畢竟敲碎以「個人」爲中心的「升官發財」的幻夢了。你只看，雖說今年年頭也還有人在幻夢着「生意興隆」或「發筆吉利，」但聰明的人們則已被時代敎乖了，他們已經了解了「羣」的意義，更了解了「我們一羣」與「他們一羣」的意義，他們知道現在已經不能僅是「但願如此，」而應該是「必要如此，」這就是說現在是「必須爭鬭，」不是「個對個」的爭鬭，而是「我們一羣對他們一羣」的爭鬭。所以在今年一開頭，「國貨年」與「剿赤年」的呼聲，便相繼而起。</p>
<p>「國貨年」與「剿赤年」的意義是什麽？這是說「個人的幻夢」已經轉變爲「羣和羣的抗爭，」聰明的人們是在急迫地希望着一九三三年從「恐慌」和「動盪」的黑潮裏拖出來。</p>
<p>這希望是不是會幻滅呢？一九三三年大槪不會不答覆我們罷。</p>
<h3>關於「排天才」</h3>
<p>— 程雲萍</p>
<p>豈凡君從前在本報自由談發表了一篇「排天才」，後來讀者顧問欄内有一位黃中席君提出疑問。本來讀者顧問欄内問欄記者已有了很好的答覆，不用我再來多嘴，但我仍有幾句話想要說一說。</p>
<p>我們這個社會中的最大多數人，是庸人，是平常人。豈凡君的話是完全對的。即使有天才，也只是極少數，而這些人社會裏的。往昔太看重了「天才」，於是天才成了「人上人」，形成了一種統治庸人的社會層，因而種種欺騙，殘酷，暴虐便由此産生。這種天才，自然應該排。</p>
<p>我們有句俗話是「吃得苦中苦，做得人上人」。這所謂「人上人」，無欵地便是統治階級。中國歷史這麽長，一大段都是君主時代。封建思想在人民頭腦裏實在根深蒂固。爲了想做「人上人」，便不惜丢了面皮，抛去人格，狗一樣到處鑽營。一旦得了志，如不擺出十足的架子，便不足以顯示其「人具」；假若不得志，便搗一面亂，再不中用，便銷沉，頽唐，浪漫。我們可以說··中國政治，一切，如此紊亂，這是一大癥結！</p>
<p>社會的進化，功勞不全是天才的。天才絶不是一個超階級的東西。我根本不承認個人的存在。個人在整個的社會内，就如我們身體上的一個細胞。一個細胞的强旺，不足以使個人健康。全體细胞的强旺，這纔可以使整個身體强健。人與社會，這關係大致相同。社會進化，不是一個庸人的力，也不是天才的力。我不知道還有人要懷疑不？</p>
<p>但天才終師不能一筆抹殺。所謂天才，簡單點說，便是聰明才智較一般人高一等的意思。可惜許多天才，因有着這高一等的聰明才智，便要來欺騙，壓榨庸衆，以形成他「人上人」的地位，給我們的豈凡先生向大家呌「排」！如果天才肯加入庸衆，帮助庸衆，我們便也不得不歡迎天才。</p>
<p>豈凡君寫「排天才」的本意，我明白。他實在也看出了政治混亂，社會不平的病象。只可惜他正如讀者顧問欄記者所說的，没有把「天才」和「人上人」分開。然而，我已說過··「天才」成爲「人上人」，是很容易的。</p>
<p>總結起來，我敢這樣說··天才如果不站立在我們的頭上，我們可以歡迎天才，否則要排。這社會，原原本本地是庸衆的社會。</p>
<h3>海燕的歌</h3>
<p>— 高爾基作宜閑譯</p>
<p>海燕（Petrel）是寒帶地方一種小海鳥，翅膀很長，有着黑白的毛羽。據說這種海鳥常在暴風雨以前出現，所以也稱StormyPetrel。</p>
<p>這首詩是高爾基所作的最著名的一首。在這首詩裏，他以暴風雨象徵革命，以海燕象徵革命詩人｜也可以說自己。　譯者識　　白濛濛的海面的上頭，</p>
<p>密集着被風兒鞭策的陰雲，</p>
<p>在陰雲和浪花的中間，</p>
<p>得意洋洋地掠過了海燕，</p>
<p>好像深色的閃電。</p>
<p>·····················</p>
<p>一會兒，他翅膀碰到那浪花，</p>
<p>一會兒，他飛近那陰雲，</p>
<p>他尖着聲兒呌，</p>
<p>這中間歡呼着急迫的暴風雨；</p>
<p>他的呌聲向陰雲報道··</p>
<p>憤努的力，熱情的熖，</p>
<p>將來的勝利的快樂！</p>
<p>····················</p>
<p>海鷗在暴風雨的前頭唉聲歏氣，</p>
<p>急急忙忙，東奔西竄，</p>
<p>生怕要埋葬在深不可測的海底。</p>
<p>濳水鳥唉聲嘆氣，</p>
<p>爲什麽唉聲嘆氣，</p>
<p>因爲他們感不到戰爭的引人的快樂，</p>
<p>而轟隆隆的雷聲驚壞了他們。</p>
<p>··················</p>
<p>愚笨的企鵝，怯怯地</p>
<p>將肚皮藏躱在巖洞裏。</p>
<p>只有海燕是，</p>
<p>獨立地，大膽地，</p>
<p>一個子飛過了洶湧澎湃的海波。</p>
<p>···················</p>
<p>低降的陰雲儘暗下來，儘近攏來，</p>
<p>波浪急於和霹靂相會了。</p>
<p>看哟！霹靂響了·······轟降隆，</p>
<p>風兒波兒起閧了。</p>
<p>看哟！風兒緊緊地擁抱了碧波，</p>
<p>將牠使勁地横在巖邊了，</p>
<p>趁着一股子凶暴的怒氣</p>
<p>將巨大的波兒｜翡翠的塊兒｜</p>
<p>砸成水沫和點滴了。</p>
<p>·····················</p>
<p>看哟！海燕掠着似的飛</p>
<p>好像深色的閃電··</p>
<p>他箭也似的穿過陰雲去，</p>
<p>他用翅膀將浪花切碎。</p>
<p>·····················</p>
<p>驕傲的，烏黑的，暴風雨的　，</p>
<p>他嘲笑轟隆隆的霹靂的盛怒。</p>
<p>他是聰慧的明達的魔··</p>
<p>他在轟隆隆的雷聲裏，</p>
<p>早就看出了，感到了，</p>
<p>怯弱的降服的信號··</p>
<p>他確信着太陽的光與熱的勝利，</p>
<p>在黑暗的一切羣衆的上頭。</p>
<p>······················</p>
<p>唿喇喇的風，轟隆隆的雷</p>
<p>好像深藍的熊熊的烟火！</p>
<p>陰雲罩在波浪的上頭，</p>
<p>海洋捉住了閃電的光芒，</p>
<p>將牠熄滅在他的胸頭，</p>
<p>牠的返光一會兒閃耀，</p>
<p>一會兒火蛇似的鑽在鹹水裏不見了。</p>
<p>······················</p>
<p>看呵？暴風雨來了，暴風雨來了！</p>
<p>在洶洶的海上，閃電的中間，</p>
<p>得意洋洋地掠過了海燕。</p>
<p>他尖着聲兒預鳴勝利的曲子··</p>
<p>歡呼偉大的將來的暴風雨！</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>「你是新興中華民國的青年的表率啊！」</p>
<p>他雖然這樣想着，但踏進Ｔ茶樓，望了一望周圍没有認識他俩的熟人，他的野心又發作了。他很不自然地伸出右手來略攬着鶴子夫人的後腰部，並着唇，一同走上了扶梯。他有幾分昏沉沉的，只聽見鶴子夫人笑着說，</p>
<p>「我頂喜歡支那料理。」</p>
<p>她說「支那料理」是使用日本的發音。他聽見後，又像突然受了毒蜂的一刺，同時聯想到在北四川路一帶來去縱横的東洋巡捕來了。</p>
<p>他感受着一種矛盾的痛苦了。於是又吁了一口氣。</p>
<p>「啊呀，林先生，怎麽今晚上這樣的不高興？」</p>
<p>坐在他對面的椅位上的鶴子夫人，正在爲他洗茶杯，揩筷子。大槪是室裏的温度陡然地高了起來，他看見她的雙頰眞是紅得十分的可愛。她說了後，向着他嫣然地一笑。</p>
<p>「不是不高興。我覺得人生眞是無聊。你看，我們不是給這樣的頽廢的氛圍氣包圍住了麽？」</p>
<p>他勉强地笑了一笑。</p>
<p>「所以我說，人生要及時行樂，顧不得許多什麽道德呀，法律呀。······」</p>
<p>「·····················」</p>
<p>他想，這不得了，她完全誤解了他的話，便捉着利用了。他沉默着，也歛了美容。</p>
<p>「林先生，歐洲的某文豪說，人生是以奇笨的事情開始，也以奇笨的事情連續，但最後是以眼涙收塲。這便是人生啊，也是有意義的人生啊！」</p>
<p>她的這般議論却把海泉嚇了一跳。她原來也是一個文學家，且不忙看輕了她哟。</p>

<h3>北平各大學吃排頭</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>一月廿八日中央社電，有一關於北平各大學的消息，大意謂我們敎育部，對於北平各大學，因榆關告緊而頗有逃考與提前放假等情事，認爲殊屬不合，「查大學生爲國民中堅份子，詎容妄自驚擾，敗壞校規，而「學校當局迄無呈報，跡近寛縱，亦屬非是」，於是乃電北平各大學，「仰該學校等迅將學生逃考及提前放假情形，詳報核辦，並將下學期上課日期併報爲要」。</p>
<p>此令旣出都門，不必說，「亦屬非是」的該校等當然得因奉此的呈報一通，不在話下，不過就此看來，北平各大學生的不中用，經中央「調查確實」之後，確是證實得無可諱言了。</p>
<p>政府從許多小民身上取出血汗來辦大學，原爲養成「中堅份子」，以爲治國平天下之「人材」，現在當這「國難當頭」，他們不獨不能爲他們「自己」的國家而捍衛國土，而且只是榆關僅僅告警，便「敗壞校規」的而一溜烟逃之夭夭，這不是太似乎有負國家敎育了嗎？而且即退一百步說，就讓日帝國主義馬上打到了北平，到那時再和守土之官一同棄印潛逃，亦不爲遲，雖然不見得也可博得「與城俱亡」之愛國美名，至少不致於有失「中堅份子」之責任吧。何况北平還是一個堂而皇之的「文化城」，豈可斷言日本皇家兵又如砲毀東方圖書館一樣的而摧毀「東方文化之寳藏」？萬一如此，那末再跑到東交民巷裏，深居高處，其奈我何？其實等到北平也捲入了僞國之版圖，又何嘗没有升官發財出路？所以北平大學生們眞是太不能高瞻遠矚太没出息了。</p>
<p>不過北平大學生，也不是毫無用處的，如「五四」運動，和「三一八」慘案，都是光榮的歷史之記載，只是「敎化子生大麻瘋，一代不如代」罷了。</p>
<p>至於「學校當局」之受着「亦屬非是」的排頭，更是活該，誰敎他們「迄無呈報」呢？這不是跡近寛縱而是什麽？假如事後也按譜就板的照章呈報上去，不是手續完備而毫無責任了嗎？難道在索薪罷敎之餘，連繕一通呈文也没有工夫了嗎？所以活該活該，第三個活該。</p>
<p>然而現在不是「埋頭窗下」或「奉行故事」的時候了，現在所需要是認清當前之大敵，爲民族前途而犧牲，特别是覺悟的大學生們，應當加入到廣大的隊伍中來，掃蕩民族革命之障礙，而奪取光明的將來，｜｜所以學生們爲民族奮鬥而不得不暫時疏荒學業，到也不是如何了不起的輫過了。</p>

<h3>桐油盛</h3>
<p>— 展能</p>
<p>「桐油」，是一種極重要的塗料，甚宜用於屋宇的裝飾，塗於木器或鐵器上可以防止木材的腐朽和鐵器的生銹，並且可以做白色瓷光釉，地板油等種種日常必需品的原料，所以我覺得很有研究的價值，茲特把它的性質，製煉，用途及檢騐法等略述於下。</p>
<p>㈠性質｜生桐油所結成的薄膜，很乏彈性，並且結膜不匀，所以必須用熬過的熟桐油方能適用，桐油的特性，能於華氏五百度以上，凝成固體，不溶於稀薄劑，但如雜有他種油類，則其凝固點常低降。</p>
<p>㈡製煉｜桐油的製煉法甚多，現在將我國美國及德國的方法介紹在下。</p>
<p>（Ａ）中國製煉方法··用桐油十斤加入土子及密陀僧各二錢，下鍋熬滾，且不住以木棒攬拌，至熬至四五滾時，可傾在瓦鉢内，不住攬拌，待其冷透後爲止，（此法火候，務宜適中，不可過激或過緩，，以防桐油之過老或過嫰，又所加之土子及密陀僧，乃取其易乾及發亮，並無其他作用。）</p>
<p>（Ｂ）美國製煉法··取桐油十加倫置於銅鍋中，徐徐熱之，達華氏三五０度時，可加入鉛錳皂十磅，俟全溶後，再加淨亞麻仁油五加倫，不住攬住之，待其温度達華氏四百度時，可保持半小時，然後離火，加稀薄劑二至三加倫，即得。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）德國製煉法；將油𤍠至攝氏二一六度時，可保持一小時，始終攬拌，勿使中止，離火後可用松節油稀薄之。</p>
<p>㈢用途｜桐油的用途甚廣，約述於下。</p>
<p>（甲）瓷光釉，用桐油，松脂，人工漆與透光瓷共研，可得白色瓷光釉，宜用於屋宇之裝飾，油重脂輕者，可塗木器。</p>
<p>（乙）護膜油··以少量桐油及多量硬脂所製之混成油，謂之護膜油，塗於三和土上，可將微隙充塞，同時其中之桐油因氣化而成堅實之護膜，以衛護三和土，使經踐踏後，不致有礁屑飛揚。</p>
<p>（丙）耐水油；桐油和地膠，可製耐水油，塗於水中之機械及管節上，可以隔除水之浸蝕。</p>
<p>（丁）塗牆油；爲由桐油及松脂所製成，塗於牆壁，可經水洗或雨淋。</p>
<p>（戊）地板油；和硬脂少許於桐油中，可製地板油，踐踏無痕，水洗不脫，最適用於火車及輪船中。</p>
<p>（己）塗刷油；又名烘油，用於塗刷汽車蓬蓋及煖爐，可以經久，其製法用桐油，豆油及少量之硬脂，共熬至華氏五二０度即得。</p>
<p>㈣檢騐｜檢騐桐油之優勢，可以用供五四０度，則純油即凝結爲淺色固體，用刀切之，不帶黏性，如油質之色較深而帶黏性者，則爲攙假之證。</p>
<h3>陽春麵</h3>
<p>— 琪冷</p>
<p>爲了每天晏起而來不及吃早飯的原故，總是吃陽春麵。</p>
<p>是一個星期五的下午，老陳無精打彩地坐在宿舍中，好像有什麽心思似的。</p>
<p>「老陳！今天爲什麽這樣不開心？」老張問着他。</p>
<p>「本星期的錢已床頭金盡了。還有兩毫錢是留作返家的車費，我正在愁着明天早上要絶食了啊。」老陳愁眉苦臉，一籌莫展。</p>
<p>「傻子！你怕没有錢吃陽春麵嗎？活人要想活辦法呀。」老張神頭鬼臉的說。</p>
<p>「你有好的辦法麽？請說出來，願從良策。」</p>
<p>「老實說，你倘若依法，不愁没有吃的。」老張似乎胸有成竹地。本來老張素有祝枝山的雅號，現在不知他又想出什麽鬼計來了。</p>
<p>「别賣關子了」。老陳催促着。</p>
<p>於是老張對着老陳的耳朶，嘰哩咕嚕的說了一陣。</p>
<p>「妙計！妙計！」老陳快樂得跳了起來。</p>
<p>···················</p>
<p>夜飯後，老范敲着碗兒，起進房來。</p>
<p>「喂！老范！密司李來了信了，可要？」老陳先開的口。</p>
<p>「在那裏？」</p>
<p>「在這裏啊。」老張開了抽屜拿出一個很大的信封來。</p>
<p>「但是給你也可以，不過要交擔條件的。」老陳向老張擠了一眼。</p>
<p>「老陳！你想敲我的竹槓麽？那可不行，我寗願不要信。」老范已看出他們的玩意兒，做作鎭靜。</p>
<p>「是封快信呢，老范！你看上面貼了這許多郵票。並且這樣厚，說不定内裏有手帕或照片呢。」老張把信拿在手中揚了幾揚。」</p>
<p>「哦！今天星期五，說不定是她明天約你看電影的。我看你即刻依了我們的條件吧；快信可以延擱一分一秒麽？我的條件也很便宜，陽春麵兩碗，祇要二百四十文便行了。」老陳一本正弳地。</p>
<p>「好吧，答應你們，信可以給我了。」老范終於中了他們的圈套。</p>
<p>「且慢，須知公平交易，老少無欺，諸親好友，一槪不欠。」老張的話眞多。</p>
<p>老范屈服了，先給了他們銅元二十四枚，然後他們給了他的信。</p>
<p>「不行，你們已把信紙偷去了。」這是一分鐘後，老范拆開信來見内中是一團廢紙，便喊了起來。</p>
<p>「且來聽我告訴你吧。」老陳說··「原來我們明早要没有錢吃陽春麵了，這是老張想出來的妙法，偷了已前密司李寫來的信封，塞了一團廢紙在裏面，封好了假造了來騙你的。請你看看這上面的日期。）</p>
<p>「哈哈！」張張止不住笑了起來。</p>
<p>老范見中了他們的鬼計，氣得一言不發。</p>

<p>現在社會上頂時髦底口號，不是愛國嗎？現在人人所崇拜敬仰底人物，不是愛國男兒嗎？</p>
<p>說也漸愧！我在社會上，混了半生，也許是半生有餘了，每每撫衷自問··可曾作過一兩椿愛國事情没有。而我底良心底答覆，却是很單简底兩個大字｜没有｜可是我又曾反躬自省，究竟我這過去底半生，一切底行爲，可能算得不愛國嗎？我底自信力，也毅然地回答我兩個大字｜没有｜</p>
<p>說到這層，關於我底意見，就有加以詳釋底必要了。因爲我没有乾過任何愛國底事業，當然不能算是愛國，這是很顯明底道理，用不着煩言的。至於我敢於自信不是不愛國底理由，就因我在</p>

<h3>British-Japanese Understanding Manipulates League of Nations Drafting Committee</h3>
<p>Ignoring the Opinions of Small Nation Representatives</p>
<p>A Trend Towards Allowing the World to Recognize the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Italy Seeks to Explain Japan's Position: Treaties Have Flexibility</p>
<p>First Two Chapters of Report Largely Drafted</p>
<p>⊙Geneva - Various smaller nations within the Committee of Nineteen today began pushing to incorporate several concrete suggestions into the report, hoping to prevent a "disguised war" in the Far East. Currently, the aim of the League of Nations Covenant and the various proposals received by the committee is to prevent open conflict or declared wars. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations after the League adopts the committee's report, these smaller nations want the League to take a stand against undeclared wars. However, the major powers currently do not support this, and if a vote becomes necessary, the smaller nations fear they will fail. The first two chapters of the report have now been drafted, and today, all members of the Committee of Nineteen can study them. However, the originally scheduled meeting of the Administrative Council has been postponed and will be decided by the main committee. The full text of various proposed amendments to the report has been distributed to all members of the Committee of Nineteen, and several of these are likely to reopen debate when the report is presented to the committee meeting. (National Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>⊙Geneva - The League of Nations Secretariat was still unable to complete its draft report on the Sino-Japanese dispute this afternoon. However, the draft is expected to be finalized and submitted to the nine-member subcommittee meeting at 3:30 PM on Tuesday. There are many revisions, and it is currently impossible to incorporate them all into the draft report. Furthermore, other members of the special Committee of Nineteen have also put forward several suggestions, including some from Irish representative Lester. If the draft report can be completed by tomorrow afternoon and approved by the nine-member subcommittee, it will be distributed to all members of the special Committee of Nineteen. It is estimated that each member will need at least 24 hours to study this document before a meeting can be convened to consider it. Therefore, the special Committee of Nineteen may not be able to meet before Thursday. Although the first few sections of the report, such as historical events and conclusions, will likely be easily agreed upon by the special committee, the recommendations section is bound to provoke lengthy and intense discussions, which are expected to be frequently delayed because members need to consult their governments. However, members have already engaged in informal discussions on this matter, with particular emphasis on the attitude the special committee should adopt regarding Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo." Although everyone opposes recognizing "Manchukuo," some believe that permanently tying the hands of all nations to prevent them from ever recognizing "Manchukuo" would be unwise and counterproductive. Regarding this point, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently declared that the interpretation of the League of Nations Covenant needs greater flexibility. Therefore, the special committee must approach this issue with the utmost caution, transforming the potential of the situation into diplomatic language. It is noteworthy that a key figure in the Chinese delegation has criticized Britain's attitude on this issue, pointing out that Britain is not only unwilling to tie its own hands but is also putting pressure on smaller nations to induce them to adopt the same attitude. The Chinese side strongly believes that Britain's pressure proves that there was indeed an agreement between Britain and Japan during the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai. The British side has now denied the existence of a British-Japanese agreement. A member of the Committee of Nineteen, representing a small nation, admitted today during an interview with a Reuters correspondent in Geneva that he had discussed this issue with the British representative and other representatives, but his discussions with the British representative were purely academic. He denied that the British representative had exerted pressure or influenced his opinions. However, in any case, the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo" will only arise when the recommendations concerning this matter in the report are submitted for discussion. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) There is no concrete news regarding the content of Sir Lindley's discussions with the Japanese authorities in Tokyo. As a result, rumors are rampant, and many feel that these rumors will harden the attitudes of smaller nations in the Committee of Nineteen who oppose moderating the tone of the report regarding "Manchukuo" and boycotting goods, making the drafting work more difficult. Unofficial Chinese circles are now paying close attention to recent developments, stating that judging from the talks in Tokyo, it is increasingly clear that there is a secret agreement between Britain and Japan.

<h3>Internal Decision on League of Nations Countermeasures Difficult: Uchida Visits Saionji</h3>
<p>Also Plans to Convene a Meeting of Senior Statesmen</p>
<p>Carefully Studying the Issue of Withdrawal</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida visited Saionji in Okitsu this morning to report on the League of Nations proceedings and the external countermeasures policy, seeking his understanding. He returned to Tokyo in the afternoon. It is reported that the Cabinet has not yet decided on its attitude toward the League of Nations and will convene another Cabinet meeting on the 1st to review the opinions of the elder statesmen. Because withdrawing from the League of Nations is a matter of great importance to Japan's survival, a meeting of senior statesmen will be convened to make a decision. Whether the strong assertions of the Japanese Army Department can override the cautious arguments of the senior statesmen remains to be seen. This issue may be resolved within the next two to three days. (China United Press Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida held talks with elder statesman Saionji for over an hour today. Uchida detailed the proceedings of the Committee of Nineteen and the various differing views within the government. It is said that Saionji advised Uchida to carefully decide on whether to advance or retreat and not to act rashly, lest he miscalculate the nation's long-term interests. The Japanese government has decided to hold another meeting tomorrow to discuss the policy to be adopted. Most members of the Diet are skeptical of the government's current attitude. It is rumored that the Seiyukai plans to convene a leadership meeting within days to specifically study the merits of withdrawing from the League of Nations. The Japanese government may request a closed session of the Diet to explain its true intentions. (China United Press Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday's extraordinary Cabinet meeting was to decide on Japan's final policy toward the League of Nations. Regarding the issue of the South Seas Mandate and the issue of the Nen River, opinions continued to emerge among Cabinet members, and a decision was postponed until a later date. Foreign Minister Uchida visited Prince Saionji today, bringing the Prince's opinions back to Tokyo. Then, on the 2nd, another extraordinary Cabinet meeting will be held. If it is decided to withdraw from the League of Nations at this time, in the interest of unifying national policy, a meeting of senior statesmen will be convened, inviting Privy Councilor Makino, Count Yamamoto Gonnohyoe, Count Kiyoura Keigo, Chairman of the Privy Council Kura-tomi Yuzaburo, and Baron Wakatsuki Reijiro to attend. Prime Minister Saito and Foreign Minister Uchida will report on the League of Nations proceedings to date, and then their agreement will be sought on the government's final policy.

<h3>Japanese Army Minister Araki Still Strongly Advocates a Hard Line</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Withdrawal or reconciliation? Japan is standing at a major crossroads regarding the League of Nations. Army Minister Araki told reporters yesterday that the League of Nations policy can only be consistently adhered to as a predetermined course of action. Today's Cabinet meeting also advocated adhering to the predetermined course of action. The Japanese government's final attitude will, of course, not change. However, it does not abandon the effort for a third option of reconciliation, but the justification for the recognition of "Manchukuo," the validity of the Japanese-Manchurian Protocol, and the confirmation of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations are three principles that cannot be moved. If the League of Nations ultimately fails to understand the Sino-Japanese issue and forcibly imposes recommendations that Japan cannot accept, Japan should resolutely strive to re-establish the League of Nations at worst, or withdraw if necessary.

<h3>Malicious Propaganda by Japan Against China</h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to Japanese sources, representatives from several southwestern provinces of China, including Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, have met and decided to establish an independent government to secede from Nanjing. Recently, someone inquired about this matter to the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, and according to the delegation's spokesperson, the southwestern provinces fully support the central government, especially regarding the issue of resisting Japan. The claim of independence is entirely without basis. (Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat today published a document from the Japanese delegation, stating that the "Manchukuo" government has extended its jurisdiction to the north.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in London</h3>
<p>(London) Dr. Kong Xiangxi arrived in London today and expressed his views to a Reuters interviewer, saying that the transformation of Chinese industry can be a way to overcome the global economic panic. The purpose of this mission is to consolidate commercial relations through greater economic cooperation. China's work is to develop its natural resources with the aid of machinery and increase the consumption of its 450 million people. This will open up a very large market to absorb other countries' surplus production. Dr. Kong also said that countries are interconnected, so all countries must respect the principles of equality and mutual respect, and the inviolability of treaties. China's construction should be a way to regulate economic balance and will be one of the most important tasks of this century. When Dr. Kong and his entourage arrived at Victoria Station, the Chinese Embassy and the British Board of Trade sent representatives to greet them. Kong originally planned to stay in the UK for a long time, but now he has shortened his trip because the Chinese government urged him to return quickly. Kong and others will visit agricultural machinery factories and woolen mills in Lincoln and Leicester. The British government and the Federation of British Industries will host banquets to entertain them. Kong and others are scheduled to leave the UK on February 3rd. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>Wang Weisan, Reporter for the Shanghai Shibao in Beijing, Assassinated</h3>
<p>=Cause Unknown=</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Weisan, a reporter for the Shanghai Shibao in Beijing, was lured to Sifangcheng outside Zhongshanmen on the afternoon of the 31st and shot to death. The cause is still unknown. (Special Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Weisan, a reporter for the Shanghai Shibao in Beijing, was 52 years old, from Anhui, and had served in the press for more than 20 years. He was suddenly assassinated at around 4:00 PM on the 31st, and the news industry was shocked. Wang also worked at the National Private Electricity Industry Federation. On the afternoon of the 31st, he was working at the federation when two men in blue cloth long gowns hired a canopy car to visit Wang at the federation on Dashi Dam Street, saying that a friend was waiting for him at the Anle Hotel and had important matters to discuss. Wang said that he was busy with work and that he did not know the two men, so he replied that he would go after he finished his work. The two men left, but after they boarded the car, they drove straight to Sifangcheng outside Zhongshanmen and got out. One of them fired a shot with a pistol, and the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited through his nostrils, killing him. At 5:00 PM, the Shanghai Shibao office received a telephone report of the tragic news. The caller identified himself as the Zhongshanmen Police Department, but when the office called back to inquire, the department said that it had not reported anything, suggesting that someone was using the department's name. The office immediately sent two people to the scene of the incident. There were already more than a dozen military police officers nearby. According to the military police, they heard the gunshot and knew something had happened, so they rushed over, but the perpetrator had already fled without a trace. Wang was lying stiff on the ground, still able to speak, but soon closed his eyes. The office urgently telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters and Wang's family, and reported to the Garrison Headquarters. Many members of the press went to the office to express their condolences. Wang left behind a wife and a daughter (three years old), and his circumstances were extremely bleak. The press is currently trying to arrange the aftermath and hopes that the truth will come to light. (Central News Agency Telegram, 31st)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Municipal Party Department Mediates Tianjin Postal Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 31st, the Municipal Party Department sent Yang Liyuan, the director of the Civil Training Section, to visit Deputy Postmaster Cao Jianting to mediate the labor dispute. Cao said that Li Shaoyu and other members of the Labor Union's Executive Committee were the perpetrators who injured Lu Fenglin and that he had asked the court to punish them. He declined mediation. In addition to hiring lawyer Li Hongyu as legal counsel, the Labor Union issued a circular saying that Cao Jianting harbored traitors, falsely accused fellow workers, arbitrarily arrested committee members, did not accept party and government mediation, incited labor unrest, disrupted the labor movement, and obstructed the national salvation movement, and requested that he be immediately removed and punished, otherwise, the bureau would be responsible for any incidents that occurred.

<h3>The Murkiness of the Quadrangle Relationship Between China, America, Britain, and Japan</h3>
<p>(1) The Friendly Future of Sino-American Relations</p>
<p>Since the Democratic and Republican parties competed in the United States last June, their platforms have largely leaned towards domestic issues. Regarding diplomatic relations, the Democratic Party has not made any concrete expressions. Regarding the Far East issue, it is particularly vague. As a result, general speculation at the time was that if Roosevelt were elected, the United States' foreign policy towards the Far East would undergo fundamental changes. However, based on past history, we know that there is no fundamental difference between the Democratic Party's foreign policy and the Hoover-Stimson Doctrine. Let us cite the fact that in 1915, when Japan forced China to accept the Twenty-One Demands, Democratic President Wilson was in office. In his note to Japan on May 13 of the same year, he stated:</p>
<p>"The United States cannot recognize any agreement concluded between China and Japan that would harm China's territorial and political integrity or the international policy of the Open Door."</p>
<p>Seventeen years have passed, and this has not changed. When the Republican Party was in power, it focused its efforts on resolving European war debts. However, European countries are already exhausted. Apart from exploiting colonies and semi-colonies to replenish their resources, it is difficult to find a way to regenerate themselves. Even if the United States can control Europe, it will not develop much. It will only be able to temporarily maintain the status quo. Therefore, since President Roosevelt XXVI, it has been recognized that the center of gravity of the world will shift to the Pacific. After the economic panic of 1929, the situation in Europe deteriorated daily, and the current situation in the Americas was difficult to maintain. Although there have been repeated estimates that the panic has reached its lowest point and that a turnaround will be seen in the future, facts have proven them to be wrong. However, the economic situation in the Far East, even though China is externally invaded by strong enemies and internally ravaged by bandits, with people having nowhere to escape death, rural areas becoming increasingly bankrupt, and cities gradually declining, the people's energy to endure hardship and the abundance of natural resources are still enough to shock the world and may transform the current difficult situation. Therefore, even under such a fragmented situation, the United States' exports to China in 1932 were still over 260 million taels. Although the amount in gold dollars is less than 100 million US dollars, it actually ranks first in imports to China. No one can deny the hope for the future. The close relationship between China and the United States, based on trade alone, is worthy of extra attention. However, the reason for the decrease in import and export trade in 1932 compared to 1931 was that the Japanese army illegally occupied the three northeastern provinces and bombarded Shanghai, destroying Zhabei and Wusong, causing China to suffer a huge impact. General purchasing power has therefore declined. Although we lack accurate and precise statistics, we can estimate that it has decreased by one-third to one-half compared to the past. This loss is directly felt by our country, but is it not indirectly damaging to our friendly neighbors as well? The Japanese military aggression is to blame. It is the Japanese imperialists who are destroying peace in the Pacific. The United States cannot tolerate this for long, whether from a political or economic standpoint. At a minimum, it must adhere to its "non-recognition (of gains by force) doctrine." Therefore, President Roosevelt has unofficially stated that he will not change the Hoover-Stimson Far East policy after taking office. After seeing justice trampled by iron hooves, we believe that this move by the United States is a glimmer of hope for the future of peace and is the foundation for friendly relations between China and the United States.</p>
<p>(2) Deterioration of US-Japan Relations</p>
<p>Our country has fully recognized the poison of Japanese military aggression. Its barbarity cannot be reasoned with. We have appealed to the League of Nations, hoping to extend our grievances and maintain peace and justice together. However, due to our weak strength and the lack of determination of the authorities to respond to violence with iron and blood, Japan has been able to indulge its greed. If the previous situation continues, and our country continues to follow the unwise policy of "verbal resistance and actual concession," then Japan will intensify its encroachment strategy. First, take Rehe and eastern Hebei, then Hebei and Shandong. In three to five years, if it can use force to overcome the current economic difficulties and successfully exploit the three northeastern provinces as a resource, then it will be easy to extend from the Yangtze River basin to the Philippines and other islands in Southeast Asia, realizing its dream of an East Asian Monroe Doctrine.</p>
<p>The United States believes that since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese national economic crisis has gradually unfolded. Its rural debt was 4 billion yen in 1930, 4.7 billion yen in 1931, and by the end of last year, the total has exceeded 9 billion yen. As for the national debt, it has also increased over time. By January 1933, it had reached 7 billion. Adding the 1 billion yen in public debt to cover the budget shortfall this year and the loss on foreign debt due to exchange rates, the actual total national debt should be over 9 billion yen. The cost of invading the three northeastern provinces alone has been 400 million yen in the past year and four months. This year, it will cost at least 200 million. If this continues, the weak Japanese people will not be able to bear it. Therefore, for its own sake and for the sake of controlling hegemony in the Pacific, the United States seems to think that waiting for Japan to collapse on its own is the best policy. However, this assumption is only a one-dimensional observation. If the three northeastern provinces are relatively stable, they can be easily obtained. At least, they can thereby plunder military resources for future use in the Pacific War.</p>
<p>Moreover, there has long been a clear understanding between Britain and Japan. This is evidenced by Simon's pro-Japanese remarks and the recent rumors of guaranteeing that "the League of Nations will never invoke Article 16 of the Covenant" and opposing the statement in the report that the puppet organization will not be recognized. From this point forward, Japan can boldly invade China, with Britain providing assistance from behind. This will not only help Japan invade China but will also help Japan against the United States, to the point of undermining the balance of power in the Far East and trampling on world peace. Can this situation be resolved by waiting? I am afraid that the longer we wait, the more irreparable the damage in the Far East will be.</p>
<p>The relationship between the United States and Japan is such, and Britain's attitude is also like this. The United States still has two oceans as a boundary and can barely protect itself. However, it seems unable to escape the control of Japanese imperialism over eastern markets. Even if our country can get the sympathy of the United States at this time, it will only be limited to spiritual assistance. Then, in the actual national struggle, is there any other way but for our people to fight with iron and blood and work hard to save themselves?</p>
<h3>The United States Navy's Elite Pacific Grand Maneuvers</h3>
<p>~The Greatest Test of Defensive Capabilities~</p>
<p>~Scheduled Duration: Seventy Days~</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, the joint naval exercises of the United States' Pacific and Atlantic Fleets commenced on January 23rd. The Atlantic reconnaissance fleet, under the command of Admiral Cluverius, departed from its three bases: San Diego, San Pedro, and Mayport, on the 23rd, heading towards the attacking force's base in Honolulu. This grand maneuver, centered on Honolulu and the American Pacific coast, is what the U.S. Navy Department calls "the greatest test of the defensive capabilities of the American West Coast." It involves 167 naval vessels, 250 aircraft, and the airship Akron. The plan is to launch a vigorous attack on Ford Island in Honolulu, which is hypothetically occupied by the enemy. The scheduled duration is 70 days, during which a major naval battle will be fought on the seas around Honolulu and the American Pacific coast. As for the Pacific attacking force, it is mainly composed of the Atlantic Fleet, organized as the "Black Fleet," aiming to occupy a part of the Pacific coast. On the 23rd, seven cruisers and the aircraft carrier USS Lexington were dispatched from San Pedro naval port, and the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga and twelve destroyers were sent from the two bases of San Diego and Mayport, heading towards Honolulu. These three fleets will converge at sea and arrive in Honolulu on January 31st to form the Black Fleet. It is planned that on February 6th, an operation will be launched to seize San Pedro and San Diego on the American West Coast. Simultaneously, the "Blue Fleet" will defend the West Coast, preventing the Black Fleet's actions and launching a counterattack, striving to completely annihilate the Black Fleet. Submarines, aircraft, and modern weapons will be used to scout the Black Fleet's movements. It is also reported that the commander of the U.S. Joint Fleet is Admiral Leigh. Leigh has ordered a new cruiser squadron to be permanently stationed in San Pedro. This squadron is composed of seven six-inch gun cruisers from the Atlantic Fleet and is part of the Pacific Battle Fleet, in order to increase the fighting power of the Pacific Fleet.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Honolulu on the 30th stated that the joint military exercises of the U.S. Army and Navy officially began today. Part of it is a simulated attack on Honolulu, so the defending forces on Oahu Island are making full preparations today. All gun muzzles within the fortified areas have been turned towards the sea in preparation for the attacking forces' assault in the next two days. On Friday, 10,000 defending troops were dispatched from their camps and deployed in strategic locations. Their artillery positions are all camouflaged, and even at a short distance, their locations are unknown. The latest high-altitude anti-aircraft guns have also been placed at various key points, reportedly having very strong firepower, capable of preventing enemy aircraft from flying low and losing their bomb-hitting effectiveness. The preparations for this exercise are widely believed to indicate whether an enemy fleet approaching the American Pacific coast can destroy America's strongly defended position in the Pacific. This year's exercise in the Honolulu area is quite short but can be considered important. American military experts are confident that any enemy attacking the American West Coast will not leave the Pearl Harbor base behind undefended, as American forces can launch an effective counter-offensive from Pearl Harbor against the enemy's very long lines of communication.</p>
<h3>Economic Conflict Between Japan and Great Britain</h3>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, the boycott of Japanese goods was very strong in our country. Therefore, Japanese goods, on the one hand, followed the army deep into various parts of the three northeastern provinces, and military supplies were shipped to the Northeast in huge quantities. In Japan's foreign trade in 1932, the three northeastern provinces actually increased by 3%. The status in the past three years is as follows:</p>
<p>%</p>
<p>1930 5.9</p>
<p>1931 5.7</p>
<p>1932 8.9</p>
<p>The reason for the decrease in Japanese goods in the three northeastern provinces in 1931 compared to 1930 was due to the boycott caused by the Wanpaoshan Incident. After the invasion in 1931, Japanese goods have been advancing directly with guns, even to this day. In our own country, Japanese goods have been decreasing year by year, and the actual situation is as follows:</p>
<p>%</p>
<p>1930 21.5</p>
<p>1931 16.8</p>
<p>1932 12.2</p>
<p>It can be seen that in these three years, there has been a decrease of 9.3%, that is, Japanese goods in China have decreased by 10% of the total exports. In the process of the Sino-Japanese conflict, Japanese goods have advanced into British colonies. In British Malaya, India, and Australia, they compete with British products. Last year, cotton and silk fabrics increased by about 80 million yuan, mostly in India and the above-mentioned areas, competing fiercely with Lancashire products. British products were completely defeated. In order to win in the commercial war, Britain held the Ottawa Conference to study countermeasures to prevent Japanese goods. The status of trade with Britain is listed below:</p>
<p>British Mainland British Colonies Total</p>
<p>% % %</p>
<p>1930 4.1 18.5 22.6</p>
<p>1931 4.7 20.2 24.9</p>
<p>1932 4.2 27.0 31.2</p>
<p>It can be seen that in British-Japanese trade, there has not been much change in the British mainland in these three years. However, in British colonies, the quantity of Japanese goods imported has increased by 8.5% of Japan's gold exports. It can be said that what was lost in China was gained in Britain. Therefore, the capital war between Britain and Japan has become even more fierce. During this period, the relationship between China, the United States, and Japan gradually weakened. The changes are as follows:</p>
<p>%</p>
<p>1930 36.8</p>
<p>1931 39.4</p>
<p>1932 33.4</p>
<p>There was a decrease of 3.4% in three years. Comparing 1932 with 1931, there was a decrease of 6%. Japanese goods have gradually lost their sales in China and the United States. Although Japanese goods are promoted in various parts of the three northeastern provinces with guns, judging from the overall situation, what is gained cannot compensate for what is lost. By looking at the import of Japanese goods in the whole of China, one can understand this reason:</p>
<p>%</p>
<p>1930 27.4</p>
<p>1931 22.5</p>
<p>1932 21.1</p>
<p>Judging from the standpoint of the commercial war, the competition between Britain and Japan is very fierce. Britain cannot be Japan's good friend forever. In the Malay Peninsula, in order to promote Japanese goods, Japanese merchants enter the villages and collude with the locals, leading them to organize cooperatives to sell all Japanese goods. The Japanese side provides various conveniences, and political connections are established through economic relations. Therefore, the British are very wary of the Japanese. From the perspective that the commercial war gradually leads to a political war between Britain and Japan, although Britain is currently very helpful to Japan politically, this kind of atmosphere is gradually brewing inside. It can be concluded that Britain and Japan cannot be good friends forever.</p>
<h3>Formation of the New French Cabinet</h3>
<p>Premier Daladier Concurrently Heads the Army, Paul-Boncour Remains as Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Socialist Party Refuses to Cooperate with the New Government</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, January 31st. Former Minister of the Army Daladier has now formed a new cabinet. The list of cabinet members is as follows:</p>
<p>Premier Daladier, concurrently Minister of the Army; Minister of Justice and Deputy Premier Béranger; Paul-Boncour, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Chautemps, Minister of the Interior; Chéron, Minister of Finance; Lamoureux, Minister of Budget; Leygues (reappointed), Minister of the Navy; de Chappedelaine, Minister of Merchant Marine; it seems that the former Minister of Aviation of the previous cabinet, Painlevé, did not agree to take the original position due to health reasons.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, January 31st. This morning, the Chamber of Deputies passed 4,000,000,000 francs for the political expenses of February, and the Senate will also pass it this afternoon. Thus, the new government has the political expenses for January and can calmly propose the budget案. The new cabinet is scheduled to appear in Congress on February 3rd.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, January 30th. Daladier had asked the Socialist Party to join the new cabinet. The Socialist Party replied this afternoon. The Socialist Party voted 64 to 17 to conditionally accept the Premier's invitation. The conditions attached were that Daladier must be guided by the principles of a special environment and the political program passed by the Socialist Party last June. The Socialist Party's political program includes: 1) Actively reducing military spending; 2) Nationalizing the insurance industry; 3) Prohibiting the arms trade; 4) Balancing the budget, but not reducing the funding for social undertakings, official salaries, or pensions.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, January 31st. Daladier has not yet been able to obtain the support of the Socialist Party because the Socialist Party's conditions are extreme and cannot be accepted by Daladier. However, Daladier is not discouraged by this failure and has still formed a purely Radical Party cabinet.</p>

<h3>The Hitler Cabinet Announces its Policy Program</h3>
<p>=Strictly Abiding by the Scope of the Constitution=</p>
<p>=Absolutely No Oppression of the Communist Party=</p>
<p>The National Assembly Will Be Convened in Early February</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, January 30th. The new cabinet held its first meeting this afternoon, chaired by Premier Hitler. Hitler stated that today is of great significance as it marks the unification of national forces to form a new cabinet. The new Premier then explained the general principles of his policy program and his attitude towards the National Assembly, which was unanimously approved by all cabinet members.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, January 30th. The new Minister of the Interior, Frick, issued a declaration to the press, stating that the new government's policy program is: 1) to advocate freedom of speech; 2) to absolutely not prohibit the Communist Party; 3) to resolutely not continue the constitutional reform plan of the Papen cabinet; 4) to resolutely not declare a state of national emergency.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, January 30th. The new Premier Hitler issued a proclamation to the Nazi Party, declaring that nationalist parties and organizations have now united to fight together for the restoration of Germany. He also stated that the Nazis have succeeded in the enormous responsibilities they have shouldered. In conclusion, he asked party members to trust him so that he has the power to rebuild Germany on the basis of honor, freedom, and social peace.</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, January 31st. It is now believed that after the establishment of the new mixed government in Germany, there will be some financial and political reforms. However, according to Hitler's spokesman, there will be no drastic changes that would cause unrest, and Hitler will govern the country according to law and reason. It is reported that all cabinet members except the Minister of Justice were decided before the announcement of Hitler's cabinet formation. However, the position of Minister of Justice is still vacant and will be filled after the Center Party decides whether to participate. The Standing Committee of the National Assembly held a meeting today and decided to convene the National Assembly no later than February 7th. The new government will announce its major policies to the National Assembly on this day. It has been announced today that the representative to the Disarmament Conference will be personally assumed by the Chief of Defense, General Blomberg.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Fiscal Credit Externally</h3>
<p>Considering Unemployment Relief Internally</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 30th - The new Director of the Federal Government Information Bureau, Mr. Funk, met with foreign journalists tonight and made a statement saying that any attempts at monetary and economic experiments that would hinder political standing will not be undertaken by the new government. He also stated, "We are willing to live in peace with everyone; this is the basis of our policy."</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 31st - The new cabinet discussed some new plans at a cabinet meeting this morning. It is said that the main focus of consideration was an unemployment relief plan, including the adoption of forced labor after raising considerable funds. Rumors have spread that the President of the Deutsche Bank, Luther, will soon resign and be replaced by the former President, Schacht. The authorities have declared that this news is unfounded from the government's point of view. The new cabinet has absolutely no intention of experimenting with finance or fiscal policy.</p>
<h3>The Center Party Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 31st - The new Chancellor Hitler conferred with the leader of the Center Party, Cardinal Kaas, this morning, hoping to at least gain the Center Party's tolerance of the government. According to the Center Party's newspaper, the "Germania," the party is not making things difficult for the government at present but is waiting for the government's administrative program before making a decision. Therefore, the Center Party may temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude and temporarily tolerate the Hitler-Papen coalition cabinet. Therefore, when a vote of no confidence in the government is proposed in the House of Representatives, the party will not participate in the vote. Some in the National Socialist Party advocate immediately dissolving the House of Representatives to hold new elections, as Hitler's rise to power has made a deep impression on the public, which may allow the party to attract some new voters. However, the government does not think so, believing that even if the House of Representatives does not trust the government, there is no need to hold a re-election, because after the House of Representatives is dissolved, the government can postpone the new election indefinitely.</p>
<h3>National Socialist Party Members Celebrate Fiercely</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 30th - National Socialist Party members celebrated Hitler's assumption of the chancellorship fiercely. The Stahlhelm also scheduled a torchlight procession in front of the State Council tonight. Starting at 6:00 PM, the National Socialist Party held a celebration. Thousands of people stood and watched at several places in the central district of Berlin, including Wilhelmstrasse, Brandenburg Gate, the Victory Column, and Unter den Linden. At 8:00 PM, 15,000 National Socialist Party members marched in orderly steps past the State Council. Hitler stood on the balcony, looking down from above. The public cheered loudly at Hitler from the streets. In the evening, Communist Party members held demonstrations in many places to oppose the Hitler cabinet, but they were dispersed by the police, and several people were arrested.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Sabotage Plan Fails</h3>
<p>National, Berlin, 31st - The Communist Party's plan to incite a general strike across the country this morning has failed everywhere. Only in Hamburg did radical shop assistants announce a general strike, but it was also unsuccessful. The party's main newspaper, "Die Rote Fahne," was ordered to be suspended indefinitely by the authorities because it published an article this morning calling on the people to stage a political general strike. Today, the people of the country are working as usual.</p>
<p>National, 31st, Berlin - Apart from minor clashes between the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party in Berlin, Halle, and Düsseldorf at night, it was relatively quiet. The most serious incident in Berlin was when a squad of the National Socialist Party's Sturmabteilung (SA) was fired upon while passing through an area inhabited by Communist Party members. One policeman and one SA member were killed. When the SA returned fire, several Communist Party members were seriously injured. The working-class areas of the capital were almost deserted, apparently because workers were staying at home waiting for the results of the shop stewards' meeting. The Communist Party anticipated changes in the situation on Monday and convened a shop stewards' meeting on Sunday. The meeting was attended by 2,000 representatives from major stores in Berlin, including some members of the Social Democratic Party and the Free Workers' Union. The speakers and the resolutions passed all stated that cooperation between the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party was a matter of urgency. After heated debate, a resolution was passed by a majority, advocating the immediate preparation of a general strike. The two left-wing parties should form a common front and elect an executive committee, consisting of seven Communist Party members and eight Social Democratic Party members, to be responsible for directing joint activities. After the meeting ended, the resolution passed spread like wildfire throughout the working-class areas. Although independent observers do not deny that there is a radical tendency in the labor movement, they believe that the Social Democratic Party is determined to wait for the development of the Reichstag to determine its course and opposes rash action. The traditional discipline of the Social Democratic Party should be able to prevent party members from joining the Communist Party. However, the government seems to have decided to exert its energy to deal with the general strike.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 31st - The Communist Party's newspaper, "Die Rote Fahne," today used the large headline "To Battle" to declare war on the Hitler government. The newspaper called on all socialist groups to participate in the general strike and revealed the resolutions passed at a meeting of 2,000 labor union leaders, stating that Hitler had secretly suffered defeat under the power of our general strike, just like the collapse of the Kapp Putsch in 1920.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Tone of Various Foreign Newspapers</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st - This morning's British newspapers all commented on the fact that Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany, acknowledging that the leader of the National Socialist Party should have the opportunity to form a cabinet, and stating that the future of the German Reichstag depends on Hitler's ability to build. The Morning Post and the Daily Telegraph expressed doubts about whether Hitler's appointment as Chancellor would be successful, saying that the leader of the German National People's Party, Hugenberg, and former Chancellor Papen would both take advantage of the situation to achieve their nationalistic goals. The Daily Telegraph also said that Hitler only represents Germany's pathological reaction after the failure of parliamentary democracy. The Times stated that future events will depend on the outcome of the new Chancellor's negotiations with the Catholic parties, but other countries will pay close attention to Hitler's attempt, especially Poland and France. At the same time, Britain will watch Germany's attitude towards disarmament with suspicion.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 30th - Major daily newspapers published lengthy commentaries on the German political situation. "L'Écho de Paris" stated that the countries bordering France and Germany, one of which is leaning to the right toward the nationalist faction and advocating revenge, and the other is leaning to the left and advocating immediate disarmament, the simultaneous ringing of these two opposing tones is truly shocking. (Note: This means that the German cabinet is leaning to the right and the French cabinet is leaning to the left.) "Le Petit Parisien" was quite surprised by the composition of the German cabinet, saying that all the opponents of the Republic in Germany had been recruited into the new cabinet, and that Mr. Hitler's experiment was very serious. "Le Petit Journal" said that Mr. Hitler's allies gave the post of Chancellor to Mr. Hitler, which was the best way to use Mr. Hitler. "Le Journal" said, "Failure often lies in victory, Mr. Hitler should understand this."</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 30th - The establishment of the Hitler government was quite welcomed by Italy. Mussolini's newspaper, "Il Popolo d'Italia," stated that Hitler had regarded Mussolini as a model since the beginning of his movement and recognized Fascism as the policy he should adopt. Many Italians expected Hitler to be able to organize a strong and unified government for Germany and make Germany valued in international affairs.</p>
<p>Havas, 30th, Capital of Yugoslavia - Newspapers here view Hitler's rise to power as a return of the old German imperialism and are quite worried.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 30th - Hitler's rise to power is attracting great attention from Austrians, as the victory of the German National Socialist Party will inevitably have a significant impact on Austria. Left-wing newspapers fear that Austria's National Socialist Party will be revived by Mr. Hitler's victory, so their tone is very agitated and they are pessimistic about the future of Germany.</p>
<p>Havas, Warsaw, 30th - Newspapers commented on Mr. Hitler's rise to power with great excitement. "Gazeta Codzienna" said, "The air of civil unrest has enveloped Germany." "Kurjer Poranny" said that Hitler would not succeed.</p>
<h3>The Italian Government Accepts the American Request to Negotiate the War Debt Issue</h3>
<p>Initial Contact Between Britain and the United States is Satisfactory</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 31st - The US government has asked the Italian government to send representatives to Washington in March to discuss the war debt issue. The Italian government has ordered the Italian Ambassador to the United States to represent the country in accepting this request.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 30th - Regarding the war debt issue, Britain no longer hopes for a written reply from the United States. It is generally believed that since the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Ronald Lindsay, has met with the new US President Roosevelt, the US's views and Mr. Roosevelt's position can be conveyed to the British government by Sir Lindsay when he returns to Britain, so there is no need for Washington to reply again.</p>

<h3>Justice Minister Oyama Almost Gets Doused with Acid for Clinging to Office</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 31st - A young man loitered outside the residence of Justice Minister Oyama for a long time this morning. The police saw him and became suspicious. When they approached to question him, the young man ran away and threw away a bottle of nitric acid along the way. He was eventually caught by the police. It is now known that the young man is a reactionary element. Because a judge under Oyama is registered as a member of the Communist Party, Oyama did not resign to take responsibility. Therefore, he wanted to douse Oyama with nitric acid when he went from home to the Diet to vent his anger.</p>
<p>○ Rubles. The Central Committee also passed several other proposals today, aimed at improving labor discipline in collective farms, increasing crop yields, preventing waste in collective farms, and cracking down on the infiltration of reactionary elements in collective farms.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Arrives in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>=Lands at Xun and Immediately Takes Special Train to Nanchang=</p>
<p>=Various Bandits, Hearing the News, Flee South Toward the Fujian Border=</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondent, After Chairman Chiang suppressed the large Red bandit groups in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui last year, he planned to come to Jiangxi to continue supervising the suppression of the Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang bandit groups and complete the task of eradicating the Red bandits. However, due to the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, he returned to Nanjing, so the trip was delayed. Unexpectedly, Zhu, Mao, and Peng, fearing that the National Army would launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression, took advantage of the violent Japanese invasion of Yuguan and launched a full-scale attack north from the Fujian border, capturing Jinxi, occupying Chongren, seizing Dongxiang, forcing Xianxian, attacking Fuzhou, and threatening Nanchang. The Fang Shao in northeastern Jiangxi, Li Zhu in southwestern Jiangxi, and Kong Hechong bandit groups in northwestern Jiangxi, as well as scattered bandits in various places, also launched large-scale activities to respond, as the bandits wanted to concentrate all their forces to make a desperate gamble and seize Nanwan to get out to the Yangtze River. At that time, the departments in the province guarded the Fuzhou area. All sectors also sent telegrams to the central government asking for help, urging Chiang to come to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression. It was heard that Chiang also considered the bandit disaster in Jiangxi to be of great importance to the southeast, and in order to consolidate the rear and eliminate obstacles to resisting Japan, he boarded the Chuyou warship from Nanjing at 9:00 PM on the 27th of this month, with the Xianning warship following. However, due to the shallow water, the ship traveled very slowly. It only arrived in Jiujiang on the morning of the 29th. Provincial Government Chairman Xiong Shihui, Commissioners Gong Xue, Li Dezhao, Wen Qun, Provincial Party Committee members Fan Zhengbo, Wang Guanying, and Li Zhongxiang, as well as the Jiujiang District Administrative Officer Chen, the Garrison Commander, and hundreds of people from all walks of life in Jiujiang, were all on the riverbank to welcome him. After Chairman Chiang landed and greeted the welcomers, he took a car to the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway Station to board a special train. At 10:30 AM, the special train departed from Xunyang. All members of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government accompanied him to the province. Chairman Xiong reported to Chiang on the train about the bandit suppression situation in the province, the military situation, and the political facilities, and discussed military and political matters. Chiang also met with the members of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government one by one, inquiring in detail about party affairs, politics, post-disaster relief in bandit areas, etc., and gave instructions on each report. The train stopped briefly in Dean. Dean County Chief Luo Yunpi and the county party affairs committee member led representatives from all walks of life to welcome him at the station. Chiang also met with County Chief Luo and the party affairs committee member to inquire about the local situation. The train then headed south, adding water and coal in Tubu. He Guoguang, Chief of Staff of the Joint Command of the Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian Provinces, rushed from the province and boarded the train to meet Chiang. He also reported the general situation of the bandit suppression in the three provinces, the Zhu and Mao attack north, the recent military situation at the front, and asked for instructions. At 3:00 PM, the special train arrived at Niuxing Station. Senior military and political officials were all at the station to welcome him. Mass organizations such as farmers, businessmen, students, party, government, military, and police lined up in order to greet him on the riverbank. At 4:30 PM, amidst cheers from the crowd, Chiang crossed the river from the station, took a car through Zhongshan Road, and disembarked at the Science Museum. Xiong, He, and others accompanied him by car, and discussed the major plan of suppressing the Red bandits at the Science Museum. It is heard that Chiang came here specifically to suppress the Red bandits. After the military deployment, he will still have to return to Nanjing. There are rumors that he will go to Wuhan, but there is no fixed date. However, the Luo Binghui bandit group has already withdrawn from Liufang in Fuzhou to Xuhuan. The Peng Dehuai bandit group withdrew from Dongxiang. The pseudo 15th Army Group withdrew from Jinxi to Zixi. According to front-line telegrams, Chen Cheng's 11th Division recovered Jinxi on the 28th, and Li Yunjie's Division recovered Xuhuan on the 25th. The Dongxiang County Chief also telegraphed the province yesterday to report that he had returned to the county to handle post-disaster relief. It is that the bandits are again trying to avoid the real and attack the empty, shrinking back to their old nests, but the armies of Fujian Province have arrived at the Jiangxi border from northwestern Fujian to cut off the bandits' retreat, and with the southeastern Jiangxi departments, taking the form of a pincer attack, it is expected that under Chiang's unified command, they will no longer be allowed to flee here and there.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Commends the Jiangxi Security Office</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondent, The General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, based on the suggestion of Jin Handing, used political organizations to assist the military in suppressing bandits. It ordered the provinces with bandits to pay attention. After receiving the instruction, the Jiangxi Provincial Security Office believed that the office's political design and suppression organization were more precise than Jin Handing's proposal. In addition to implementing political orders such as reorganizing security groups, organizing teams, conducting joint defense, going deep into bandit areas, harvesting late rice, recruiting refugees, and appeasing those who were coerced and those who repented, it ordered the county chiefs of all county areas that were fully or partially occupied by bandits to secretly plan to recover them with political force, and formulated appropriate measures for each response. It ordered the counties to comply with the records. According to the above-mentioned process, it copied the instructions and reported them to the General Headquarters. It is heard that Chairman Chiang, who is also the Commander-in-Chief, gave instructions to Jiangxi yesterday, saying that the office's proposals were very correct and worthy of praise and consolation.</p>
<h3>Huang Shao-hong and Cai Tingkai Arrive in Guangdong One After Another</h3>
<p>=Huang Conveying the Central Government's Intentions=</p>
<p>=Cai Discussing National Salvation Plans=</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondent, It is heard that Huang Shao-hong, the Minister of the Interior, is here this time to negotiate with the authorities in the two Guangdong provinces. When Mr. Huang arrived in Hong Kong, Li Zongren happened to be in Hong Kong to meet with Li Jishen. He then accompanied Mr. Huang to Guangzhou. That afternoon, Li and Huang visited Chen Jitang and the Central Committee members in the Southwest. The authorities held banquets to welcome Huang. According to Mr. Huang, after arriving in Hong Kong this time, he met with Mr. Li Jishen and conveyed the central government's opinions. Mr. Li's illness has gradually improved, but there is no date for his return to the north. He also visited Hu Hanmin and discussed the current situation. Only on the evening of the 22nd did he come to Guangdong with Commander Li Zongren. His only task was to exchange opinions on the current situation and domestic affairs with the Central Committee members in the Southwest. As soon as the negotiations are completed, he will return to Guangxi. The purpose of returning to Guangxi is that Guangxi is actively handling the people's militia, so he will take the opportunity to inspect its training status. Also, Guangxi recently established a political experimental zone, and he also intends to inspect its facilities and content. The Guangxi authorities previously intended to assign him the position of director of the political experimental zone, but because of the busy affairs of the ministry, he had no time to go south to preside over it, so he still recommended Wu Tingyang to be responsible. He will return to Guangxi and stay for two weeks before returning to the north. Because the situation in Hebei is tense recently, the central government has actively prepared to deal with the Yuguan incident and plans to have a whole plan. The people of the country should work together for the country, he said. On the 23rd, Chen Jitang hosted Huang at the Taiping Restaurant, with Li Zongren, Zhang Renmin, Miao Peinan, and Huang Huabiao accompanying him. They dispersed happily until about 2:00 PM. Huang was originally scheduled to return to Guangxi at noon on the 23rd, but because there were still important matters to be discussed in Guangdong, the schedule was temporarily changed. Only Ma Junwu returned to Wuzhou first. It is heard that Huang is temporarily staying in Guangdong to exchange opinions on the current situation with Cai Tingkai. It is because Mr. Cai arrived in Hong Kong from Fuzhou by boat on the 24th and arrived in Guangzhou on the 25th. After Huang met with Mr. Cai, he scheduled to return to Guangxi around the 27th or 28th.</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai, the commander of the Nineteenth Route Army, recently arrived in Guangzhou from Fujian on January 23 because the military leaders of the two Guangdong provinces were gathered in Guangzhou, and Huang Shao-hong, the Minister of the Interior, also arrived in Guangdong to discuss important matters regarding the current situation. He arrived in Hong Kong on the 24th, stayed in Hong Kong for one night, and arrived in Guangzhou at 2:40 PM on the 25th. His companion was Weng Guiqing, the director of the army's office in Guangdong. After landing, Mr. Cai returned to the mansion on Daxiang Road to rest briefly and received guests. He expressed extreme indignation at the recent invasion of Yuguan by the violent Japanese. According to him, "This time the enemy captured Yuguan, attacked Jiukou, and attempted to annex Rehe, invaded Pingjin, and got an inch and wanted a mile, gradually trying to encompass Hebei and directly attack the Yangtze River. The Southwest cannot be guaranteed either. Our army has long seen through the conspiracy of the Japanese warlords, so in the Battle of Shanghai, we were not afraid of how violent the enemy was, and annihilated their fierce offensive. We declared that even if there was only one soldier left, we would not allow the enemy to succeed. The current situation is that only a war can be used to seek survival. If we continue to be negligent, the result will not be only the destruction of the country. If you look at Turkey when the national crisis was pressing and the land was shrinking day by day, its government even moved to the mountains and fought a desperate battle with the enemy, so it finally achieved its goal of revival. Now our country has not yet reached the point of danger that Turkey was in that day. If we can unite from top to bottom and use the army of the whole country to deal with the violent Japanese, the country's fortune may not be irreversible. For this reason, our army recently specially asked the central government to volunteer to go north to kill the enemy. The central government has telegraphed that it should be temporarily concentrated and await orders. Once the order is given, I will lead the ten and eight regiments of troops to the north and fight a decisive battle with the enemy again. Success or failure is not what I care about," he said. Mr. Cai has met with Huang Shao-hong, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and other members of the Southwest Central Committee for many times in recent days to discuss various important issues of resisting Japan and to discuss plans to eliminate the communist bandits in southern Jiangxi in the short term. It is expected that he will stay in Guangdong for a few days before returning to Fujian. (January 27)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<h3>Minister Niu Visits Friends in Songjiang</h3>
<p>Minister of Personnel Niu Yongjian has a very close friendship with the American missionary Bu Huilian of the Le'en Church. They often visit each other. This time, when Mr. Niu returned to Ke Township from Nanjing, he learned in Shanghai that the missionary Bu had caught a cold, so he was very concerned. He specially came to Songjiang yesterday. Because Mr. Niu traveled lightly, the agencies did not get the news and did not have time to welcome him. Mr. Niu went directly to the Le'en Church to visit the missionary Bu and chatted happily in front of the bed for several hours. They said goodbye and took the Songjiang bus back to Maqiao to reunite with his family.</p>
<h3>Provincial Order to Secretly Arrest Shi Dagong</h3>
<p>The county government received a secret telegram from the provincial office, ordering the arrest of Shi Dagong, a suspect in a certain case, and to send him to the province for interrogation, etc. The Public Security Bureau was ordered to secretly send Inspector Yang Shijie to cooperate with the county police team to go to Tinglin yesterday (the 30th). Without making a sound, Inspector Yang first entered the house. While they were talking, the team immediately entered and arrested Shi, and found a po-dao, a stabbing knife, a sword, and a pistol. He was escorted to Songjiang today and sent to the province for investigation tonight. It is rumored that Shi's arrest was due to another criminal obtained by the province who confessed that he and Shi were working together in the Pudong area of this county for some kind of work. Now his family members have visited various important people to seek rescue plans.</p>
<p>Jiading</p>
<h3>Arresting Gamblers and Resisting Arrest, Shooting and Wounding People</h3>
<p>On the 27th of last month, the Xuhang Public Security Branch sent patrol chief Wang Keyu and police officers Zhao Dazhi, Zhu Zhongshan, and Xu Mingfu to Xijia Village, about a li north of Fanjiabao Bridge, to arrest gamblers. The villagers resisted en masse, saying that there was a three-day grace period for the Lunar New Year, knocking Wang Meng and almost drowning Wang. He opened fire six times in extreme panic, and the bullet hit villager Xi Yueting, breaking his right foot and leg bone. Wang then escaped. Zhao, Zhu, and Xu were all tied to telephone poles, beaten and kicked, and were seriously injured. Xi Yueting's family went to Xuhang to question the branch, and the situation was very turbulent. After mediation, Xi was sent to Jiading Hospital for treatment, and the matter was settled. On the 28th, the Public Security Bureau sent the three injured police officers to the county for examination. After the police officers confirmed the injuries, they were also sent to Jiading Hospital for treatment. It is heard that there is no danger to their lives.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>Dredging of Daqiao River Implemented</h3>
<p>Daqiao River, outside the North Gate of this county, is an important route for the Suzhou-Changzhou traffic on the canal. It is currently not very well silted, and ships often run aground. During the winter season when the water is dry, the County Chamber of Commerce convened various industries to discuss dredging methods and raise funds to organize the Daqiao River Engineering Committee, which is responsible for the construction bureau. Starting from the Taogeng and Wang Yuanlai doors along the river to the river along the sesame cake, construction of the dam began on January 24. The county government is deeply concerned that the traffic of ships will obstruct the project, and specially issued a bulletin to inform the public to facilitate the work. The section of the river has been drained by water pumps day and night, and the water has been drained. Many fish and shrimp have been caught. Yesterday, electric lights were installed in the river and more than a hundred workers were hired to start dredging. It will be completed in a few days, and the stone feet of the Daqiao Bridge will be repaired to strengthen the bridge.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu-Jurong Road Bus Service Resumes</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Jurong long-distance bus service was previously interrupted due to snow and ice. It was inconvenient to drive in the cold weather, and the number of buses was reduced. Now that the weather is gradually warming and the ice and snow have melted, the management office has decided to resume the original number of buses and operate as usual from February 1 (i.e., a total of eight buses run between Zhenjiang and Jurong). The bus timetable has been changed, i.e., the last bus from Jurong to the province has been changed to 3:40 PM to connect with the Jiangnan Bus Company.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Talks in This County</h3>
<p>The Party and government agencies in Zhenjiang County held a talk yesterday at the County Government. More than ten people, including the Party Committee and the heads of the county bureaus, attended. The chairman was County Chief Zhang, and the resolutions were: (1) to allow the barbers' union to reorganize; (2) to train storytellers, teach them Party ideology, and schedule talks; (3) to have the Provincial Public Security Bureau find a way to crack down on the monopoly and unauthorized exploitation of dock workers; (4) to have the Public Security Bureau order each branch to arrest and send vagrants to the Vagrant Arts and Crafts Institute due to the proliferation of beggars along the streets.</p>

<h3>All Sectors Respond to National Salvation Through Aviation</h3>
<p>The Public Lovingly Donates to Purchase Airplanes for National Salvation</p>
<p>Rushing to Donate Enthusiastically</p>
<p>Since the China Aviation Association advocated national salvation through aviation, all sectors have responded with enthusiasm, raising funds to purchase airplanes. The vigorous atmosphere is worth our publicity. However, "a drum rouses energy at the first beat, flags at the second, and drums are silent at the third," as the ancient training warns. I deeply hope that all sectors will be aware of the deepening national crisis, forge ahead bravely, and not retreat. I hope that you will not engage in empty talk and take pleasure in the moment. This is what the reporter hopes for.</p>
<p>[P Aviation Association Announcement&gt;</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Serves as the Captain of the Headquarters</p>
<p>Lin and Wang Went to Hangzhou Yesterday to Establish a Branch</p>
<p>After the establishment of the China Aviation Association, No. 99 Jessfield Road was selected as the address of the association. However, the business community is in the process of closing accounts, and the repair workers are also taking a break according to custom, so the place has not yet been completely repaired. However, due to the small size of the preparatory office, it is not enough to use. Now some of the staff have moved in to work. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Lin Wojiang, the executive director of the association, at the preparatory office to discuss the current situation of the association. The following is a transcript:</p>
<h3>Seeking Members</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin stated that the membership rules of this association were drafted at the beginning of the preparation stage and announced during the inaugural meeting. Recently, numerous letters have been received from various places requesting the rules and applying for membership. In this city, the Executive Committee decided yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) to organize a membership recruitment team, extensively gathering comrades to work together. Mayor Wu was nominated as the captain of the recruitment team, with Director Wang Rutang as the chief of staff. Therefore, all planning related to membership recruitment will be carried out through consultations between Directors Wu and Wang.</p>
<h3>Organizing Branches</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin continued, stating that yesterday's meeting also nominated Directors Lin Kanghou and Wang Xiaolai as preparation committee members for the Hangzhou branch. This morning (i.e., yesterday morning), the two gentlemen have already traveled together to make all arrangements. As for other regions, branches will be organized in important cities in order. Smaller areas such as counties and towns will organize sub-branches, with the ultimate goal of extending the organization's reach throughout the country. If vocational groups voluntarily collect funds to purchase aircraft, the name of the group will be used as the name of the aircraft, and the association will handle the custody and use. Currently, in addition to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the chambers of commerce in Qingdao and Wuxi have also contacted the association with letters expressing their intention to initiate fundraising for aircraft purchases.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Aircraft</h3>
<p>In the future, after raising a considerable amount of funds, the first step will be to order various aircraft from foreign countries. The second step will be to establish factories for self-manufacturing. Raw materials such as steel and wood are still produced in our country, and the required quantities are also small. The most difficult and lacking aspects are the manufacturing of engines and the required refined steel, as our country lacks large-scale manufacturing factories for both. In the future, we should actively construct them to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
<h3>Publishing Publications</h3>
<p>After Mr. Lin finished speaking, he presented a book published by the association, "Comparison of Air Forces of Major Powers." The book, written by Mr. Lin, details the strength of the air forces of various countries to show the efforts and strategies of various countries in aviation construction, serving as a reference for the people of the country. In this high tide of saving the country through aviation, it is indeed a good guide. Regarding the construction of our country's air force, it does not focus on manufacturing aircraft carriers but emphasizes airships and, even more so, on cultivating talents for civil and commercial aviation as reserve combatants for the air force. The statistics of the air force strength of various countries as contained in the book are now reproduced below:</p>

<h3>Four Patriotic Children</h3>
<p>Saving Candy Money to Donate for Aircraft</p>
<p>Mayor Greatly Admired Upon Receiving Letter</p>
<p>Various agencies and organizations in this city held an Aviation Save-the-Nation Propaganda Week at the end of last month, in order to make the general public aware that national defense should focus on aviation equipment, and to encourage them to actively donate funds to assist the government in purchasing aircraft to strengthen national defense. It is reported that four children residing at No. 71, Lane 201, Luban Road—Fang Xiaoruo, an 11-year-old boy; Chen Yingzeng, a 14-year-old boy; Dong Ying, a 14-year-old girl; and Fang Yunying, a 12-year-old girl—sent a letter to Mayor Wu, proposing that children voluntarily donate to manufacture a Shanghai Children's Aircraft to show that children's patriotism is no less than that of adults. They donated four silver dollars saved from their usual candy money to the municipal government for the purchase of aircraft. Mayor Wu deeply appreciated their intention and specially replied to the four children, praising them greatly. He also forwarded the four silver dollars to the Aviation Association for receipt. The letters from the four children and the mayor's reply are transcribed below:</p>
<h3>Letter from the Four Children</h3>
<p>Our beloved Mayor, the day before yesterday, we heard your speech on saving the nation through aviation on the radio, and we were deeply moved. The barbaric Japanese imperialism, which does not abide by justice, seized our three northeastern provinces last year, killed thousands of our compatriots in Shanghai, and destroyed countless houses. This year, they seized our Shanhaiguan. Now they want our Beiping, Tianjin, and other places. We should resist desperately. But we children cannot go to the front line to kill the bandits, but we should also bear some responsibility. I now respectfully propose to the Mayor to persuade all children in Shanghai to save candy money to buy a military bomber to fight Japan. Now, we four children have gathered together, and each of us has donated the candy money given to us by our mothers, totaling four silver dollars, and asked the Mayor to vigorously promote it. If a "Shanghai Children's Aircraft" is successfully built, then our China will surely be saved. Beloved Mayor, we hope you will work hard for us children with all your heart, and wish you courage and health. Attached are four silver dollars. Eleven-year-old boy Fang Xiaoruo, fourteen-year-old boy Chen Yingzeng, fourteen-year-old girl Dong Ying, twelve-year-old girl Fang Yunying.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Reply</h3>
<p>Reading your letter makes me very happy. Your innocent and fervent spirit of loving the nation and saving the country is not only worthy of admiration but also proves that our nation's future still has infinite hope. Your support for and practice of saving the nation through aviation can not only serve as a model for children across the country but also as a standard for people across the country. We will do our best to promote your proposal to persuade all children in Shanghai to save candy money and donate to purchase aircraft. We plan to publish the letter in newspapers so that children throughout the city and the people of the country can be excited and launch a grand and widespread aviation save-the-nation movement. The donation of four yuan you sent has been handed over to the Aviation Association, and the receipt will be sent directly by the association. Wishing you health and hard work. Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Donates Aircraft</h3>
<p>Named "Shanghai Merchant No. 1"</p>
<p>Assuming the Aircraft Price is 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to all executive and supervisory committee members yesterday, stating: We are writing to inform you that on January 27th, the Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to discuss how the business community should simultaneously proceed with saving the nation through aviation. It was decided that all executive and supervisory committee members should first donate funds to purchase one "Shanghai Merchant No. 1" aircraft. Assuming the aircraft price is 100,000 yuan, then each of the executive and supervisory committee members should be responsible for donating at least 5,000 yuan, and more if possible, as a pioneering effort. It has been found that the Japanese public has donated as many as 62 aircraft. Moreover, the Shanghai academic community has also launched a fundraising campaign to purchase aircraft. At a time when our business community is facing increasingly urgent external threats, it is even more necessary to take on arduous tasks and seek ways to defend ourselves. Therefore, this case is specifically recorded and communicated to you, and it is hoped that you will check and promptly raise funds according to the quota and submit them to the Chamber by the end of February to realize the planned plan as soon as possible, serving as a pioneer for the business community. We are deeply grateful, etc.</p>
<h3>Academic Community Donates Aircraft</h3>
<p>China Education Society Initiates</p>
<p>Submitted to the New Council for Implementation</p>
<p>The first annual meeting of the China Education Society was declared closed the day before yesterday. That evening, the China Vocational Education Society and more than ten other academic groups held a public banquet for all members at the New New Restaurant, with more than 100 guests and hosts, all of whom were prominent figures in the education field. During the banquet, Wang Yunwu, general manager of the Commercial Press, was elected by the host groups to give a speech. Mr. Wang elaborated a great deal on the significance of education, and his words were insightful, and the entire audience applauded. Then, member Jiang Wenyu gave a speech and made a temporary proposal, roughly stating that in this autumn of serious national crisis, we are still calmly discussing ways to reform education. For now, the most important thing is to build aviation, so as to save the day. I now propose that this association initiate a nationwide fundraising campaign in the education community to purchase aircraft. The method may be to set a small amount for each elementary school student (ten cents), middle school students (fifty cents), university students (one yuan), and faculty members (two yuan). If it can be implemented, the amount will be more than ten million yuan nationwide. I wonder what everyone's opinions are? The entire body immediately raised their hands in favor and submitted it to the newly elected council to prepare detailed measures and notify schools across the country for implementation.</p>
<h3>Customs Officials Donate to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>Winning the Approval of Most Branches</p>
<p>Deciding on a Plan to Proceed</p>
<p>Customs officials have always been sincere in their efforts to relieve the national crisis. Recently, in view of the rising tide of "saving the nation through aviation," a proposal was made for "customs officials nationwide to donate salaries to purchase aircraft." According to the news from the General Club of Chinese Staff of Foreign Departments of Customs throughout the country in this port, it is heard that the method of donating salaries to purchase aircraft has won the approval of most branches, and it has been decided to unite customs officials nationwide to decide on a plan and proceed immediately.</p>
<h3>Origin of the Lake Society's Aircraft Fundraising</h3>
<p>Wu Zhihui and Others Initiate Fundraising</p>
<p>"Chen Shenfu" Fighter Plane</p>
<p>Chen Yingshi's eldest son, Shenfu, died in a training plane crash on September 9 last year at the Jianqiao Bridge in Hangzhou. He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, and others initiated a memorial service at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road on the 18th of last month. At that time, Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and others proposed setting up a memorial and raising funds to purchase a fighter plane named "Chen Shenfu," and all the representatives present would be the initiators to leave a memorial. This was unanimously approved, and all members of the Lake Society were entrusted to be the preparatory committee members of the fundraising committee for purchasing fighter planes in memory of Chen Shenfu. A reporter from Huadong News met with Bao Juxiang, a member of the preparatory committee, yesterday. According to him, this matter is now underway, including rules and regulations for fundraising. All the origins have been drafted by Pan Gongzhan and Shen Youxin and passed by the standing committee. They will be submitted for discussion at the executive meeting to be convened soon to engage in fundraising and purchasing. The origin is recorded below: Chen Shenfu was the eldest son of the revolutionary martyr Mr. Yingshi. He was born intelligent and had extraordinary ambitions from a young age. During the January 28th Incident last year, he was indignant at the weakness of national defense and the invasion of short bandits. He believed that without an air force, it would not be enough to defend against foreign aggression. Therefore, he applied to the Jianqiao Aviation School, planning to serve the country in the future and continue his father's legacy to fulfill his aspirations to serve the country. Unexpectedly, on the second day of school, he accompanied Instructor Shi Manniu on a training flight and died tragically. His great ambition was not fulfilled, and he died first, which is deeply regrettable. My colleagues are aware that recently, the important fortress of Yuguan has been ravaged again, and the violent flames of the tyrannical Japan are becoming more and more obvious. They increasingly feel the urgent need for an air force. Therefore, they will purchase an aircraft as a sign of remembrance and to comfort the loyal soul. All gentlemen are no less patriotic than others, especially when the national crisis has not yet ended. They will surely be happy to follow suit. Please generously donate as much as possible, so that you can gather strength and realize it as soon as possible. You will see the flying wings in the sky, startling the enemy, and the Yellow Dragon will drink heartily, and open the flowers of revolution everywhere. The name will be passed down through the ages, and the story will be equal to the title bridge. The sound will be heard in five continents. With the same ambition to love the country, this action will not only be a slight comfort to the spirit of the martyrs, but also a representation of the will of the people. This is the beginning.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping Line Started Taking Passengers Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Passengers and Mail on the Shanghai-Hankou Line are Crowded</p>
<p>According to Guomin News, after the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping line opened last month, the results of transporting mail on a trial basis were quite good. It was originally scheduled to start selling tickets to passengers on February 1st, but the night before, a foreigner named Louis went to the company to request to buy a ticket to Beiping. The company immediately accepted and boarded the No. 12 plane, piloted by pilot An Laisheng, which flew to Beiping at 6:55 a.m. yesterday morning, and carried 3,622 kilograms of mail. As for the Shanghai-Hankou plane, it also flew to Hankou at 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, piloted by pilot Smith on the No. 4 plane, carrying two Chinese merchant passengers and 5,828 kilograms of mail. According to Secretary Li of the company, many people are afraid to take it. Now, the number of passengers is increasing day by day.</p>
<h3>Wu Chaoshu Discusses Recent International Events</h3>
<p>Entering Beijing Today</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Dr. Wu Chaoshu, a member of the Central Committee, at his residence yesterday morning. During the conversation, he shared many opinions related to recent international issues. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mandate Rule</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, there are several small islands in the South Pacific that used to belong to Germany. Although they do not have abundant products, they are strategically important because they are located at the crossroads of sea routes. Since the end of the European War, the major powers divided and seized Germany's overseas colonies at the peace conference. The small islands in the area were entrusted to Japan by the League of Nations, and the League of Nations stipulated the regulations for the mandated territory. The main point was that no military facilities should be established in the mandated territory. Since Japan took over, due to the above-mentioned restrictions, it improved the ports in the mandated territory. Since the outbreak of the Eastern Province Incident the year before last, the League of Nations received reports of Japan's military installations in the area. Before the truth was verified, it was inconvenient to comment. If it is true, this is a clear and arbitrary violation of the League of Nations' regulations by Japan, endangering peace in the Far East. I believe that the League of Nations has the right to revoke its mandate. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, whether its mandated territory will also be revoked is a question that requires very detailed research, because there is no precedent to refer to.</p>
<h3>Sino-Russian Situation</h3>
<p>After Japan seized the Northeast, it made every effort to expand its power, causing the Soviet Union to be wary. A conflict of interests is inevitable. However, observing the attitude of the Soviet Union, it is quite patient and seems unwilling to cause unexpected changes as a result. But what will be the trend between the two countries in the future? It depends on 1. the degree of Japan's invasion of China, 2. the degree of Soviet Russia's patience, and 3. the extent to which Soviet Russia's own interests are violated by Japan.</p>
<h3>US-Russian Resumption of Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>The rumor that the United States and Russia will resume diplomatic relations has been circulating for some time. The strong advocacy of Senator Borah, a famous American senator, for recognizing Soviet Russia has won the sympathy of the American government and the public. Borah has long advocated the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia. In this critical period, there is a possibility of rapid realization. The American authorities have always expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's aggressive actions. Their attitude is the same as that of Soviet Russia. The future trend of Japan and the United States depends on the extent to which Japan infringes upon the interests of the United States itself.</p>
<h3>War Debt Problem</h3>
<p>The key to the world-shaking war debt problem lies in the attitude of U.S. President-elect Roosevelt, which is closely watched by the world. Roosevelt recently stated that he is willing to negotiate with various countries and hopes that various countries will give the United States commercial conveniences. The United Kingdom is prepared to send important officials to the United States to discuss and resolve the payment issue. Whether it will be reduced or waived, or whether another method of repayment will be found is difficult to predict. In short, I deeply hope that this matter can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Secret Agreement</h3>
<p>There were rumors that the United Kingdom and Japan had an understanding during the Shanghai ceasefire last year. Whether it is true or not, I dare not say. But before the investigation is clear, we are unwilling to criticize it.</p>
<h3>Entering Beijing Today</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu continued, stating that he had proposed at the Third Plenary Session to establish popular opinion organs in various provinces and counties, which was approved by the conference. He was also elected as one of the drafting members of the National Political Council organization regulations. He plans to go to Beijing tomorrow (i.e., today) to attend the first meeting of the drafting committee on Thursday and return to Shanghai in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commemorates the Martyrdom of Boy Scouts Yesterday</h3>
<p>Families Plan to Build a Clothing Tomb in Shanghai Cemetery</p>
<p>The members of the 50th Regiment of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts, Luo Yunxiang, Bao Zhengshi, Ying Wenda, and Mao Zhengxiang, were killed by the Japanese army during the January 28th Incident last year. Yesterday morning at 7:30, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a first anniversary memorial meeting. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Faint Memory of the Situation　Those who attended included Zheng Chengqing, general director of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; Yuan Hongjun, director; Wang Peiyuan, director of the Chinese Red Cross Society; representatives of various Boy Scout groups; Ye Chunnian and Xu Guozhi, the leaders of the regiment; and more than 100 Boy Scouts. On the family side, Ying Henian, the elder brother of Ying Wenda, and the mothers of Luo Yunxiang, Mao Zhengxiang, and Bao Zhengshi attended.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report　After the leader of the regiment, Ye Chunnian, presided over the sacrifice and flower offering, he reported the circumstances of the disappearance, rescue, and martyrdom of the four Boy Scouts. The families advocated building a crested tomb in Shanghai Cemetery with the compensation money to leave a memorial. Then, the Boy Scouts sang a dirge, and all who heard it could not help but shed tears.</p>
<p>Showing of a Film　After the meeting, the Lianhua Film Company showed three types of films to mark the anniversary: last year's citywide Boy Scout Grand Review, the memorial service for the four Boy Scouts who died in the line of duty, and the anti-Japanese citizens' rally of all walks of life in Shanghai after the September 18th Incident.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Electric Power Company Will Issue Bonds</h3>
<p>HSBC Bank and Others Organize a Syndicated Underwriting</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC Bank in this port announced that the bank is underwriting 33 million taels of Shanghai Electric Power Company's 5.5% first mortgage bonds and has formed a syndicate with Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Wan Guo Savings Society, Liann Yangxing, and Xinfeng Yangxing, etc. At present, 18 million taels have been identified, and the remaining 15 million taels will be issued in the market in the near future. The actual receipt for this bond is 96, with accrued interest paid. The combined principal and interest of each 100 yuan can get 5.75% interest. As for the reason why the Electric Power Company is issuing corporate bonds this time, it is because after the company purchased the Electrical Department of the Public Works Bureau in 1929, the purchase price was 82 million taels, and it was agreed to pay it in batches. The repayment will be cleared by December 30 this year, and all company assets will be mortgaged. At present, the company has paid 56,693,910 taels for the purchase price and 12,991,513.22 taels for interest. There is still a purchase price of 24,306,090 taels to be paid in full this year. At the same time, capital has also been increased by 16,000,000 taels in expanding equipment. If combined with the purchase price paid, the company has invested 72,000,000 taels. However, this investment of 72 million taels is currently only the guarantee for the remaining purchase price of more than 24 million taels and its interest. Therefore, the company specially consulted with the Public Works Bureau in accordance with the original contract terms to recover the original collateral and replace it with the guarantee of HSBC Bank. At the same time, the company's exclusive rights and real estate within the Public Concession were transferred and mortgaged to HSBC Bank as collateral for the bank's guarantee of the remaining purchase price and the issuance of 33 million taels of bonds. This method has been approved by the Public Works Bureau, and a formal contract can be signed in the near future. Once the procedures are completed, the company can use the bond income to repay the Public Works Bureau. At the same time, it can use the remaining funds as capital. In this way, the bond interest rate is relatively lower and short-term debt is transformed into long-term corporate bonds, which also greatly benefits the company's financial position.</p>
<h3>Madam Sun Denies Involvement with the Beiping Women's Relief Association for Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News stated that Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching Ling, recently issued a statement protesting against groups or individuals using her name without her permission. The statement stated that she had no relationship with the Women's Relief Association for Wounded Soldiers organized by Madam Zhang Xueliang in Beiping, and she did not entrust anyone in the north to speak on her behalf. She only entrusted a certain gentleman in the north in a purely private capacity to investigate the number of wounded soldiers in various hospitals in Beiping and the number of political prisoners in various prisons in the north.</p>
<h3>The Former Site of the County Government Has Been Cleared Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has moved to Beiqiao and has completed the move to its new office. All county party headquarters and finance bureaus also moved to the new office by yesterday. Therefore, the entire former site of the county government has been cleared. The money and grain counter next to the county government belongs to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Land Bureau and does not need to be moved. As for the price of the land and houses at the former site of the county government, it is 80,000 yuan, which has been paid in full by the municipal government. It is now heard that the county government has notified the municipal government to send personnel to take over as soon as possible. In addition to the County Education Bureau, there is also the Local Property Management Office among the county-level agencies that have not moved. Due to various relationships, it may be difficult to move in the near future.</p>

<h3>Japanese Goods Invade the Yellow River Coast</h3>
<p>Since our country has been resisting Japanese goods, it has been difficult for the Japanese to mix them in at the commercial ports. Recently, they have changed their strategy and are selling them along the Yellow River to the interior of China, using traitors to import a lot. Yesterday, a friend who runs an import and export business came to Shanghai from Huaihai. The reporter met him at the hotel and received a detailed account of the situation of Japanese goods entering the Yellow River coast. It is relayed as follows:</p>
<p>Departing from Dalian　The source of Japanese goods is all shipped from Dalian, divided into parts and wholesale in two types. They are rebranded and disguised as domestic goods, colluding with a private shipping company established by a certain Lu person in Dalian, promising huge profits. At least four or five thousand pieces are shipped out every month, all of which are ordered to be transported to the Shijiusuo area between Qingdao and Haizhou, where they are unloaded and then transferred to another boat for sale in the interior.</p>
<p>Sailing Ships for Sales　Shijiusuo has no customs checkpoints. The Japanese secretly set up warehouses there, agreeing on more than a dozen sailing ships. As soon as the Japanese goods are loaded, they are repackaged into large and small packages and carried out by the sailing ships along the Yellow River to various villages and forts along the river for sale. Because there are no donations and taxes, the price of goods has fallen to two or three percent of the cost. The people benefit from their low prices, so sales are booming.</p>
<h3>Repercussions from the Shooting of Liu Yusheng</h3>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Reporter Association Executive Committee Proposal</p>
<p>Civil Rights Protection League Meeting</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government executed Liu Yusheng, editor of the Zhenjiang Jiangsheng Daily, sparking public outcry. Wu Zhongyi and others, executive and supervisory committee members of the Shanghai Journalists Association, have specially submitted a request to the Central Government to severely punish Gu Zhutong. The association will hold a full executive and supervisory committee meeting at 4 PM today to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Civil Rights Protection League, will also convene reporters from various newspapers at 4 PM today at the Hua An Building to discuss this matter.</p>
<h3>Post Office to Offer Telegraphic Money Orders Immediately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has received an order from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to establish a new type of telegraphic money order to expedite public remittances, which will be available from February 1, 1933. The procedures for this type of money order are as follows: (1) Direct Telegraphic Money Order (transmitted only by telegraph): Initially, remittance receipts will be limited to various postal administrations and a number of first- and second-class post offices. Indirect Telegraphic Money Orders can be sent to most exchange bureaus nationwide. These indirect telegraphic money orders will be transmitted by telegraph to the post office nearest to the paying office that handles direct telegraphic money orders, and then mailed by that office to the paying office. However, the public should note that indirect telegraphic money orders are only advantageous in certain circumstances, specifically when the paying office is far from the remitting office. Therefore, all bureau chiefs have been instructed to inform remitters if a regular money order would be faster. (2) In addition to the regular money order fee, a telegraphic money order will incur a telegraph fee calculated by the number of words, plus a telegraphic transfer fee of 2.5 per mille of the remittance amount. The remitter should provide the recipient's name and address in detail to facilitate prompt payment. (3) After the remitter has paid the remittance and fees to the post office, the post office will issue a receipt for the remitter to keep. The remittance will then be telegraphed to the recipient by the remitting office or via a transferring office. (4) If the recipient of a telegraphic money order cannot prove their identity, payment can be made with a guarantor. For all other details, please inquire at your nearest post office.</p>
<h3>The Qian Zhuang (Traditional Chinese Bank) After Year-End Closing</h3>
<p>To Improve Business by Emulating Bank Practices</p>
<p>Profitable Despite Impact of War</p>
<p>First Meeting of Member Representatives Tomorrow</p>
<p>After completing the year-end closing for the 21st year of the Republic, the Qian Zhuang in both the northern and southern parts of Shanghai resumed business on the day before yesterday, starting to issue account books and improve business by emulating bank practices. Despite the impact of the war last year, fortunately, all were profitable. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Improving Business: Qian Zhuang businesses have traditionally focused on lending based on credit and have operated in this way for a long time. Starting in 1933, in order to meet the needs of various sectors, each Zhuang will emulate bank practices, adding departments for mortgage loans, factory loans, trusts, remittances, savings, etc., in addition to existing services. The first to implement this will be the Fuyuan Zhuang, managed by Qin Runqing, chairman of the Qian Zhuang Association. The Yintai Zhuang, managed by Ma Sicang and Lin Ruiting, has decided to move to the old site of the Fuyuan Zhuang on Ningbo Road next month and will also emulate bank practices.</p>
<p>Profits of Each Zhuang: A reporter from Xin Sheng She interviewed a member of the Qian Zhuang Association yesterday, who stated that since the September 18th Incident in 1931, all industries have been affected. Qian Zhuang businesses, which primarily rely on credit lending, were bound to face danger. For caution, each Zhuang immediately implemented a contraction policy and carefully issued loans. Since the January 28th Incident, all industries have further declined. Fortunately, the Qian Zhuang had already shrunk in size after the September 18th Incident, so the impact was relatively small. After the year-end closing for the 21st year of the Republic, all Zhuang had profits, ranging from 5,000 to 150,000 taels, with the average around 40,000 to 50,000 taels.</p>
<p>Start Issuing Account Books: The new and old Qian Zhuang in the northern and southern markets that have resumed business in 1933, including 62 in the northern market such as the Huihua She Yuan, and 5 that have not entered the Yuan Zi Hao (brand name), such as the Dingshen Zhuang; and 5 in the southern market such as the Huihua Zhengxiang Zhuang, and 5 that have not entered the Yuan Zi Hao, such as the Yuanfeng Zhuang, totaling 77. Those that have not yet resumed business are the Xin Tonghang Huihua Tongqing Zhuang and the Lao Tonghang Huihua Anyu Zhuang, which are scheduled to resume business next month. The Qian Zhuang that have resumed business started issuing account books (i.e., opening accounts) on the day before yesterday, to be completed by February 9 (i.e., the Lantern Festival).</p>
<p>First General Assembly: After the Qian Zhuang in the northern and southern markets resumed business on the day before yesterday, the Qian Zhuang Association has scheduled its first general assembly of member representatives for the 22nd year of the Republic for 3 AM on February 2 at the Qian Zhuang Market on Ningbo Road to discuss various matters after the resumption of business.</p>
<h3>Fengpu Ship Out of Danger</h3>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai Possible Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Changjiang-class Fengpu ship of the Sanbei Shipping Company, which sailed from Hankou to Shanghai on the 23rd of last month, ran aground near Jiujiang. After a ship was dispatched from Hankou for rescue, it was immediately out of danger. Unexpectedly, the ship continued sailing downstream and ran aground again near Tai Zi Ji in Anqing at 9 PM on the 29th. The ship owner rescued it again. At that time, the Qingpu ship happened to pass by, and it was towed out of danger at high tide at noon the next day. The company received a telegram yesterday. Whether the ship's hull is damaged or not will only be known after the ship arrives in Shanghai for inspection. It is estimated that the ship will arrive tomorrow.</p>
<h3>County-Administered Deed Tax: Owners to Pay Directly to Bank</h3>
<p>Effective February 1</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating in brief: It is noted that the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Public Debt Fund Management Committee has submitted a report proposing changes to the collection and payment of deed tax in order to rectify the deed tax and consolidate the credit of the construction debt fund. When people pay deed tax, the county bureau will first issue a notice indicating the amount of tax due, and the taxpayer will first go to a designated bank or an agent Qian Zhuang to obtain a receipt, and then submit it to the county bureau to process the deed. The tax payment notice and receipt form have been submitted to the provincial government and have been amended, discussed, and approved by the Departments of Finance and Construction. Now, the committee has reported that the designated bank or agent Qian Zhuang for collecting and paying deed tax has been negotiated and agreed upon, and it has been decided that February 1, 1933, will be the date to start collecting the money. Please notify all county bureaus to comply. In addition to the notice and instruction, a proclamation and measures, as well as a list of designated banks or Qian Zhuang, are hereby promulgated. After receiving the order, the county government has, in addition to posting the proclamation for public knowledge, instructed the Finance Bureau and all district chiefs to comply accordingly.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association</h3>
<p>Adoption of This Year's Association Work Plan</p>
<p>Election of President, Committee Members, and Honorary Directors</p>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association was established in the spring of 1928 by individuals such as Kong Xiangxi, Kuang Fuzhao, and Gao Fengchi. It has been almost five years since its founding. The association's work, including child protection, child relief, child health, child research, as well as orphanages, nurseries, and children's clinics, has been practical and achieved significant results, widely recognized by the public. The association recently held its fourth annual meeting at the YMCA Zhongshan Hall, located at 20 Museum Road. A summary of the proceedings is provided below.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>Qian Zhenya, Li Yuanxin, Mr. and Mrs. Wu Zhijian, Jia Xiyan, Gu Xingqing, Yin Guanzhi, Chen Lengseng, Fischer, Ellis, Miss Barger, Miss White Rock Bay, Miss Wu Yuxin, Wu Weide, Chen Tiesheng, Wang Yi, Chen Zhengfan, Zhang Yueru, Xuan Bokun, and dozens of others.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Address</h3>
<p>The meeting began with an opening address by the chairman, Kong Xiangxi (represented by Qian Zhenya), who stated, "Since its establishment, the association has worked hard to promote children's welfare, starting from fundamental planning. It provides relief and protection to abused children, promotes the well-being of ordinary children in various ways, and strives to cultivate them into useful talents for the nation and society in the future. This undertaking is extensive and involves numerous tasks. It requires the concerted efforts of all members and the awakening of the nation's awareness of children's welfare to jointly promote this child welfare movement for the revival of the nation." The chairman then read the annual meeting declaration, which was unanimously approved and is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>The association is about to complete its fifth year of establishment. In the past five years, with the support of domestic pioneers in child welfare and the assistance of international colleagues, we have developed gradually and expanded steadily. We have managed to carry out several initiatives, such as child protection, child relief, child health, child research, and facilities such as child welfare gardens, orphanages, and clinics. We also requested the National Government to designate April 4th as Children's Day to draw the attention of the entire nation, hoping that this child welfare undertaking can be promoted to all cities, towns, and villages across the country, so that every household and everyone knows that children are the future masters of the country and should work together to nurture them, so that 120 million children can achieve complete happiness and full development. Our association is willing to unite with people across the country to create a new environment and a new society for children, thereby restoring the highest position of our Chinese nation and promoting the unparalleled glory of our Chinese nation. Children are the inheritors of the nation, and children's welfare is the fundamental work for national revival. We hope that compatriots across the country will use their full strength to promote this cause, expand the child welfare movement, and seek happiness for children who are deprived of care, education, and support, in order to lay a new foundation for our nation. At this critical time of national crisis and the pressing threat of powerful neighbors, our colleagues feel the weight of our responsibilities even more. We must work together with people across the country, refine our spirit, strive for self-improvement, and accomplish this great mission. This is our declaration.</p>

<p>| Professional swindlers of Western tableware apprehended |</p>
<p>In the past month, new scams have been occurring on Shanghai ocean liners. Two swindlers specialize in defrauding valuables from the dining rooms of various ships. Many have been fooled. Yesterday, the chief mate of the Haizhou steamer apprehended the criminals and turned them over to the Water Police Station. Our reporter investigated and presents the details below.</p>
<p>Swindling Lianxing's Goods: The swindlers consist of three or four people, with two operating each time. They specifically target newly arrived ocean liners. The Lianxing steamer of the Zhaoxing Company, arriving in Shanghai from Dalian and Tianjin, was targeted on January 30th. Two swindlers, one dressed in a short blue cloth jacket and the other in Western attire, appearing quite affluent, approached the Lianxing steamer to see the supervisor. The supervisor was unavailable, so chief mate Li Jin received them. The swindlers claimed to be the supervisor of a certain ship, produced a business card with a title, and stated that they needed to borrow Western tableware due to a shortage for entertaining guests on board. They also falsely claimed to be acting on behalf of a certain gentleman and that they were acquainted with the supervisor of the Lianxing steamer. Li Jin, unsuspecting, lent them the items. When the supervisor returned, he denied knowing the individuals and, upon inquiring with the supposed friend, confirmed that no one had been sent to borrow the items. It was then realized that they had been swindled.</p>
<p>Report to the Navigation Society: After being deceived, Li Jin reported the incident to the Navigation Society, a gathering place for sailors, and posted a notice warning all sailors not to be deceived by such incidents. The society also informed its members, instructing them to detain any swindlers who approached the ship and hand them over to the authorities to prevent harm to other ocean liners.</p>
<p>Swindling Haizhou Steamer Again: The Haizhou steamer of the Hezhong Company returned to Shanghai from Dabu and docked at River Tube No. 23. In the afternoon of the previous day, two swindlers arrived at the ship, seeking to see the supervisor. However, all the crew members were ashore, leaving only a few stewards. They were told that no one was on board and that they should return the next day (January 31st). The two swindlers returned by sampan at 10 a.m. the following day, seeking to see the supervisor. Chief mate Li Dacai met with them and inquired about their business. They claimed to be from the Anxing steamer, seeking to retrieve the Western tableware borrowed by the Haizhou steamer from the Anxing steamer's supervisor on January 26th of the previous month. Li Dacai, having received notice from the public association, recognized them as swindlers. Without revealing his suspicion, he played along while devising a plan to capture them.</p>
<p>Two Swindlers Captured: Li Dacai stated that if they wanted to retrieve the borrowed items, they should enter the supervisor's office and collect them themselves. Overjoyed, the two swindlers entered the supervisor's office and collected countless Western utensils, including knives, forks, bowls, and plates, claiming they belonged to the Anxing steamer and instructing the other swindler to carry them away. Unbeknownst to them, Li Dacai had signaled for their sampan to leave and summoned the Water Police. The two swindlers were apprehended, the stolen goods were recovered, and they were handed over to the police for severe punishment. Li Dacai also reported the case to the police station and presented the stolen goods, which bore the Haizhou steamer's markings. The two swindlers were left speechless. The case of swindling on ocean liners, which had been ongoing for a month, was finally exposed yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Two Courts Burned Confiscated Drugs and Reactionary Books and Newspapers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Local Court regularly burns confiscated drugs, such as opium, raw opium, opium paste, smoking paraphernalia, red pills, morphine, cocaine, heroin, and the like, every three months to demonstrate its determination to combat drugs. Yesterday was another scheduled burning. The burning location was still the Tongren Fuyuan Tang Yizhongdi (cemetery) to the south of the court. The drugs burned were those confiscated during the three months of October, November, and December of last year. The variety was extensive, and the quantity was considerable. The estimated value was even more significant. Court President Guo Yunguan took the burning of these drugs very seriously. He selected staff members to supervise the court clerks as they transported each item from the confiscated goods warehouse to the burning site. In addition to sending letters to various municipal agencies and legal associations, inviting them to send representatives to supervise, he also dispatched several court investigators to the site to oversee the clerks' work. Inside and outside the site, court police were ordered to maintain strict order. At 2:00 p.m., the burning began. Each item was first inspected before being thrown into the flames and doused with salt and kerosene to prevent any irregularities. The burning continued until sunset. President Guo also issued a notice to inform the public.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court periodically gathers and publicly burns reactionary books, newspapers, and other printed materials confiscated by the court. As a considerable amount of such materials had accumulated, requiring immediate disposal, Court President Shen Jiayi selected yesterday afternoon as the date to burn them. The burning site was located in the Yizhongdi to the south of the court. In addition to sending invitations to various agencies and organizations to send representatives to observe the proceedings, he also dispatched several court investigators to the site to oversee the clerks' work. The materials burned included a large quantity of certain communist books, followed by certain reactionary newspapers. In a short time, they were reduced to ashes.</p>

<h3>Midnight Robbery in Dark Alley, Police Officer Dies in Line of Duty, Two Robbers Captured</h3>
<p>Gunshots Suddenly Ring Out Near the Great World</p>
<p>Police Officer Wang Weigui Dies While Capturing Robbers</p>
<p>Two Robbers Captured by Patrol Team</p>
<p>At around 2:00 a.m. yesterday, outside the wall of the Great World amusement park on Avenue de Messimy in the French Concession, gunshots suddenly rang out. Initially, residents thought it was firecrackers being set off for the Lunar New Year and paid little attention. However, the cries of "robbery" grew louder, causing chaos on the street. It was then realized that armed robbers were resisting arrest. As a result, a Chinese police officer was shot in the head, his brains splattered, and he died shortly after being taken to the hospital. Two robbers were captured at the scene. Details are provided below.</p>
<p>Robbers Strip Clothing in Dark Alley: Zhu Chunlin, a 27-year-old Wuxi merchant residing at No. 1 Fuxing Lane, Avenue Bai Le, French Concession, went to the Great World amusement park with his roommate, Qiu Jinchang, on the evening of the fifth day of the Lunar New Year (traditionally known as the day of the God of Wealth). They returned home at around 1:00 a.m. yesterday. However, as they were passing the Huanghe Road entrance behind the Slaughterhouse Company on Rue Glocque, three robbers suddenly emerged from a dark alley. Two were wearing long robes, and one was wearing Western attire. The one in Western attire pulled out a pistol and threatened Zhu, robbing him of a gray gabardine jacket and one dollar and twenty cents in cash.</p>
<p>Robber in Western Attire Fires from Behind: After obtaining the stolen goods, the three robbers headed north along Avenue de Messimy. Zhu, unwilling to let them get away, secretly followed behind. Due to the late hour, he did not see any patrols along the way. He followed them to the side gate of the Huangjin Grand Theatre on Avenue Edward VII, where he saw Police Officer Wang Weigui (29 years old, from Yancheng), No. 614 of the Mecan Police Station, on duty. Zhu immediately approached him and reported the robbery. The police officer, upon hearing the report, bravely stepped forward to block their path and search them. As the police officer was searching the first robber, the robber in Western attire at the rear suddenly drew a pistol and fired at the police officer. The bullet struck the police officer's right forehead, and he collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>One Robber Ultimately Captured After Pursuit: After the police officer collapsed, his brains splattered. The three robbers took the opportunity to flee east along Avenue de la Route. At that time, a special patrol team from the police station happened to be inspecting pedestrians in the area. Upon hearing the gunshots, they knew something was wrong and rushed to the scene. They saw two robbers fleeing for their lives and immediately surrounded them, drawing their pistols and chasing after them. As a result, one robber was captured at the intersection of Xixinqiao Street and taken to the police station. The injured Police Officer Wang was immediately taken to Renji Hospital by car. However, his skull was shattered, and he died upon arrival.</p>
<p>Robber in Western Attire Ultimately Falls into the Hands of the Law: After being taken to the police station, the captured robber, after being interrogated, confessed his name as Yu Tingrong, 33 years old, from Ningbo. He also revealed that his accomplices were hiding in Room 54, 5th floor, Siming Hotel, No. 96 Xizilaihuo Street. Superintendent Jin Jiulin of the special task force, along with detectives Zhang Ziquan, Bao Daogui, Cai Mianzhang, and others, rushed to the scene to search. They successfully apprehended the robber in Western attire, who confessed his name as Zheng Ziming, 19 years old, from Ningbo. A six-round revolver and forty-two bullets were found in the room. The barrel of the gun still showed signs of recent firing. Both were taken to the police station for detention.</p>
<p>Two Robbers Escorted to Court for Questioning: After Police Officer Wang Weigui died in the hospital, detective Wang Licheng was dispatched by the police station to take the body to the mortuary at Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall. At 11:00 a.m., the police station escorted Yu and Zheng to the Second Special District Court, where Criminal Court Judge Wang Wangxu presided over the trial in Criminal Court No. 1. First, police station lawyer Yao Zhaodi stood up and presented the case, stating that the case was still under investigation and requesting a postponement. He then presented the pistol, bullets, and stolen coat as evidence. Next, Zhu Chunlin, the victim, testified about the circumstances of the robbery. When questioned, the first defendant, Yu Tingrong, admitted without hesitation that he, Zheng, and Tang Awu, who was still at large, had committed the robbery and that he had shot and killed Police Officer Wang Weigui while resisting arrest. The second defendant, Zheng Ziming, also confessed that, in a moment of panic, Tang Awu ordered him to fire at the police officers to scare them away. Afterwards, he returned to the hotel and hid the pistol in the room. He was about to escape when he was apprehended by a detective on the second floor.</p>
<p>Autopsy of the Tragically Deceased Police Officer: Judge Wang then asked where the pistol came from. The answer was: "Tang Awu gave it to me." Judge Wang reviewed the confession and ordered them to be taken back into custody, rescheduling the trial for February 21st. He also instructed the Chief of the Criminal Affairs Division of the General Police Station to request the Second Special Court to appoint Prosecutor Deng Baosun to conduct an autopsy on the body at 11:30 a.m., accompanied by forensic doctor Jiang Xuan and clerk Peng. After the detectives reported the circumstances, the father of the deceased, Wang Gusheng, testified that the deceased was his son and that he had been tragically shot and killed by robbers. He requested justice. Deng Jun obtained a statement and ruled that Wang Weigui had died from being shot in the head by robbers. The body was released to the father for burial after he signed a pledge. After the police station completed the autopsy, the body was photographed and taken for burial.</p>
<p>Police Station to Provide Generous Compensation to the Deceased's Family: Police Officer Wang's home was located at No. 14 Qing'an Lane, Caojiawan. His father, Wang Gusheng, was nearly seventy years old and depended on the deceased for support. He was devastated by his son's tragic death. Police Officer Wang had served in the police force for only a little over a year and was known for his diligence. His death in the line of duty was deeply mourned by the head of the police station. It was reported that, in addition to raising funds to help the family with funeral expenses, a request had been submitted to the Chief of Police to provide generous compensation to console the deceased and serve as an example for the future.</p>

<h3>The Disaster Area Fire Insurance Association Sent Representatives to Beijing Yesterday to Petition</h3>
<p>| Requesting the Authorities to Negotiate Compensation |</p>
<p>Regarding the fire insurance claims in the disaster areas, the Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association believes that the foreign merchants only recognize relief but refuse to provide compensation. Negotiations by the Social Affairs Bureau and business figures such as Yu Qiaqing for compensation have yielded little results. Yesterday, the association specially sent representatives Hu Yibo, Mao Xiangyi, and others to Beijing to petition, requesting the government to find a way to expedite compensation. The representatives departed from Shanghai for Beijing yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Huashang Public Bus Company</h3>
<p>Talks with Huang Zhongwen</p>
<p>Huang Zhongwen, General Manager of the Huashang Public Bus Company, made the following remarks to visitors: The Huashang Public Bus Company was established in Shanghai four years ago. Business has generally been good, but in recent years, due to the impact of the financial crisis, it has suffered significant losses. Unfortunately, it was further affected by the January 28th Incident, lending nine buses to the 19th Route Army for transportation purposes, but the compensation has not yet been received due to procedural issues. At this time of recovery, we are facing immense difficulties. We are still striving to continue, hoping to live up to the trust placed in us by the municipal government. If the Jiangwan Municipal Business Sub-Office is dissatisfied with our company's service, we would be grateful for their direct guidance and will sincerely accept it. According to the company's past operations, in 1931, the Jiangwan route had 2.4 million passengers, with an average of nine to ten buses dispatched daily. Since the resumption of operations after the war last year, over a period of seven months, we have had a total of 620,000 passengers, with an average of six to seven buses dispatched daily. Compared to the entire year of 1931, the number of passengers per bus is still 90,000 fewer. However, in the past, there were no criticisms or accusations of endangering public safety. Overloading vehicles causes damage to the machinery, as anyone familiar with the automobile industry would know. As for the service staff on the buses, the company has specific regulations to ensure their compliance. Furthermore, all employees, both senior and junior, have identification numbers. The public is welcome to report any violations of the regulations. If the Jiangwan Chamber of Commerce Sub-Office is truly working for the benefit of the people, we would be honored to receive such information. The company's service remains consistent, but in the past, when business was good, the company was favored by all parties and provided a significant number of free ride tickets each year. Due to the difficult business environment after the war, in order to conserve resources, the board of directors decided, with great reluctance, to temporarily cancel all tickets. These are the differences before and after the war. We hope this announcement is made public. The authorities may issue instructions to the company in the near future. We have no other intentions except to serve the public. If there are any shortcomings, we will improve accordingly. After Mr. Huang's statement, the visitor asked, "Regarding the municipal government's revitalization plan and the development of the city center, how is your company preparing to meet the transportation needs?" Mr. Huang replied, "The response plan has already been formulated. When the municipal government building is completed, we plan to open three new routes: (1) From Baoshan Road, via Ketiyu Road, Yinxiang Road, Songhu Road, to the new municipal building, then to Jungong Road and Wusong Town; (2) From North Sizhulu Road, East Baoxing Road, via Shuidian Road, Tiyu Road, Jiangwan Racecourse, to Jiangwan Town; (3) From Diswei Road, Qimei Road, Yinxiang Road, Jungong Road, to Shanghai University. We are actively preparing, but the capital issue is a concern. The company has recently issued new shares. If it were not for the ripple effects of the rumor-mongering, the matter would not be difficult to accomplish. The results of the share increase are also not bad. We hope for the support of all sectors to allow the local people to run the local business, so that the company's plans can be implemented on time. We have high hopes for this."</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Counterfeit Money Operation Cracked in Datangzhen</h3>
<p>Printing Equipment and Colored Paper Seized</p>
<p>Cao Lianheng Unrepentant, Specializing in Counterfeit Bills</p>
<p>On January 24th, Detective Feng Baishun, Detective Sun Dehui, and Detective Jin Haibo of the Huishi Police Station arrested two major suspects involved in counterfeiting, Zhou Baosheng from Shanghai and Cao Jinbao from Jiangyin, in Room 28 of the Anle Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. Ten counterfeit ten-yuan bills were found on Zhou. Based on their confession that the counterfeit bills were given to them by a Mr. He, the husband of a Mrs. He from Changzhou, a request was made to the French Concession police station to send additional detectives to No. 247 Route Lafayette to arrest Mr. He. However, he had already fled, leaving only Mrs. He at home. Fifty counterfeit five-yuan bills were found hidden in her shoes. She became flustered and, under the pretext of entering the room, took off her shoes and threw them into the toilet. The detectives initially had no intention of questioning her, but seeing her suspicious behavior, they followed her into the room, retrieved the shoes, and found the counterfeit bills, leading to her arrest. Subsequently, Chen Yushan and Chen Wangshi from Jiangbei, Zhang Rongqing from Shanghai, and Lu Wenxiang from Changzhou were also arrested in the house. Eighty-five counterfeit five-yuan bills were found hidden on Zhang. The following day, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court and ordered to be detained for investigation, as previously reported. On New Year's Eve of the old lunar calendar, the detectives again found Cai Luozhang from Changzhou and Cao Lianheng from Anhui at No. 247 Route Lafayette and in a bungalow on Fuli Road. Cao specialized in counterfeiting banknotes. His case was exposed in 1927 and he was sentenced to four years in prison by the court. After his sentence expired, he gathered accomplices to resume his old business. His counterfeiting operation was located at No. 57 Li's residence, under the address of Li Guixiang in Beishiqiao, Datangzhen, Baoshan County, and was very large in scale. On January 28th, Detective Feng and others went to the address, but Li Guixiang had already fled. All the printing equipment and colored paper were seized and transported back to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, Cai and Cao were escorted to the First Special Court and interrogated by Judge Liu Yugui. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, presented the details of the case and requested a postponement to combine the case with Zhou Baosheng and others. Detective Feng reported on the continued arrest of suspects and the seizure of equipment. Judge Liu briefly questioned Cai Luozhang and Cao Lianheng and ordered them to be detained pending a combined hearing.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Inland Water Company to Implement New Business Regulations Today</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Inland Water Company was issued a reorganization plan by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities in 1928, it has added new-style rapid filtration ponds and changed to electric water suction machines. The equipment was improved and completed in July 1931, resulting in clean water quality and high pressure. The company also replaced large-diameter water pipes and installed water meters universally, abolishing the fixed-rate system and calculating water charges according to meter readings. By the end of 1932, all water meters for users were installed, adding up to more than two million yuan in equipment costs. Recently, because the original business regulations were no longer applicable, the company was ordered by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to revise them to make them perfect. The revision has now been approved by the Municipal Government and will be implemented on February 1st of this year. The internal operating procedures have also been greatly improved, and the procedures for users to apply for water supply have been expedited to benefit citizens. It is also reported that the company has a loan program to help those who are unable to afford to install water pipes. Furthermore, in areas with large numbers of common people, retail taps have been set up to sell water at low prices, so citizens of Nanshi, regardless of their social class, can enjoy clean and hygienic drinking water. These are all recent achievements of the company's efforts.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Bureau to Purchase Wheat Handling Equipment</h3>
<p>A large amount of American wheat will be shipped to China successively. The Shanghai China Merchants Bureau plans to set up wheat warehouses near the Huazha to store it. It is said that the bureau also plans to purchase wheat handling equipment from foreign merchants to facilitate the unloading of wheat and avoid losses. The plan is under consideration.</p>
<h3>Publication of the Pure Land Five Sutras</h3>
<p>In recent times, after Liu of Yushoutang, Guichi, meticulously engraved and printed a large number of woodblock editions of rare and ancient books, Liu of Jiayetang, Wuxing, and Li Xu of Nanling followed suit and competed with them. However, with the prevalence of lithographic and letterpress printing, the publication of woodblock books has become increasingly rare, which is regretted by general book collectors who value editions. Thereupon, Guo Shuangbai, the owner of Luzhai in Chaoyang, has entrusted Dong of Songfen Studio in Wujin to meticulously proofread, engrave, print, and bind rare and ancient books for many years. Ten kinds have already been published, which has a great style of following in the footsteps of Wu's Yue Ya, and most of them are Buddhist scriptures and rare books of exhortation to good, with clear and elegant lines, large and pleasing characters, clean and white paper, and fragrant and radiant ink. The aim is to attract the initial faith of book collectors who have not yet developed a heart and to explore Buddhist principles. It is indeed a unique and commendable effort. Not only does it surpass the two Lius, but it also shines brightly with the collection of wooden-block Buddhist classics before and after. Therefore, famous people and dignitaries, such as Duan Zhichuan, Xu Juren, Chen Zhenru, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhang Taiyan, Fu Yuanshu, Dai Jitao, and Wang Yiting, have praised it as solemn and elite, and something never before seen. It is heard that another edition of the Pure Land Five Sutras has recently been published, which has been revised by Master Yin Guang. It collects the essential sutras of the Pure Land School, such as the Amitabha Sutra, the Contemplation Sutra, the Infinite Life Sutra, the Chapter on Perfect Penetration of Mindfulness of the Buddha by the Bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta, and the Vows of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, into one volume, forming a great compendium. It is a large six-opening book on cotton paper, one thick volume per set. The selling price, excluding the cost of the plates and engraving, only covers the cost of paper, ink, printing, and binding, which is two silver dollars. It is entrusted to Dong of Wujin, located in Ju Huili, Seymour Road, for consignment sales.</p>

<h3>Deceased in Fuyuanli Had Committed 15 Theft Cases</h3>
<p>| Died of Injuries from a Fall Yesterday |</p>
<p>The body of a man was suddenly discovered outside No. 6 Fuyuanli, Kangding Road, Shanghai West, at about 5:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. Yao Baoshun, the street sweeper of the house, reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, which ordered Chinese Detective Zhang Liang to investigate. A wallet was found on the deceased, containing several cards with the words "Shao Hougen, Detective No. 14, Taicang Public Security Bureau." The detective immediately sent the body to the Fielun Road Morgue for examination, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the police station found that the deceased lived at No. 31 Jiangjiaqiao, Xiaoshadu Road, and also found in the fingerprint files that the deceased was also known as Gu Guisheng, and had committed as many as 15 theft cases in the concessions. Footprints were found on the roof of No. 4 Fuyuanli, indicating that someone had walked there. It is feared that the deceased intended to commit theft but fell accidentally. The police station sent someone to the Taicang Public Security Bureau to inquire if there was such a person, but there has been no reply yet. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, Prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court, together with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the morgue to examine the body. After examining the body, they sat in court and interrogated the deceased's wife, Shao Zhangshi, who claimed to be 22 years old. On the second or third day of the lunar new year, a friend of her husband named A Si came to gamble with her husband. He came twice again on the fourth day. Then the two of them went out together and did not return. She did not know that her husband had committed crimes and said that Gu Guisheng was her husband's brother's name. Guo Jun obtained the confession and determined that Shao Hougen died of injuries to the head from a fall during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his wife, Shao Zhangshi, to take back for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>

<p>Huang Zhengyou, a native of Changzhou, is 24 years old, young and handsome, and well-dressed. He visited Hongkou Park with his girlfriend the day before yesterday, talking and laughing as they walked, in a state of great happiness.

<h3>City News</h3>
<p>Recent News from the Sino-Foreign Document Agency: The Sino-Foreign Document Agency, organized by Tao Shujin and others in Renle Village, Lane 124, Luban Road, has been receiving a steady stream of clients from all walks of life entrusting them to handle various documents since its opening. Recently, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce that all newly established companies should apply for registration within the time limit stipulated in Article 5 of the Company Law, and those companies that have been established but have not yet applied for registration must be punished according to law before June 30, 1933. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce complied, and once discovered, they will be punished according to law. There are countless businesses in the city that use the words "company" or similar words, but in the past, due to unclear procedures or inconvenient transportation, there were many that had not applied for registration. Since receiving the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs' instruction transferred by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, companies that have been established but not yet registered, in order to protect their legal interests, have been entrusting the agency to complete the registration procedures. Therefore, the busiest documents for the agency these days are company registrations. It is also heard that the agency is planning to recruit several clerks due to the heavy workload. Those who believe they have the ability can go to the agency to register for an interview.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I have read a news item in your newspaper yesterday entitled "The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Bureau of Public Utilities Requesting the Rectification of the Jiangwan Public Buses," in which the content is entirely fabricated and intentionally disrupts the company's business. The second point stated that "ticket inspectors, ticket sellers, and drivers are mostly rude, scold, and fight, which is commonplace" is especially unfounded. It is verified that the on-board staff and workers all have identification badges and numbers. If there is any of the above behavior, it should be noted, reported to the company, and severely dismissed. However, the Jiangwan Branch Office of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce did not specify anyone, but made indiscriminate accusations and published news in the newspaper, which is related to the reputation of our members. In addition to making separate representations, we respectfully request your newspaper to provide a correction to clarify the facts. Sincerely, The Shanghai Sixth District Public Automobile Industry Workers' Union, January 31st.</p>
<p>To the Editors of Shenbao: I have just read a report stating, in brief, that the Ministry of Communications has investigated the complex composition of this association and has therefore cancelled the association's registration and ordered it to merge with the Chinese Aviation Association. This association considers the merger to be another issue. As for the phrase "complex composition," not only are there no facts, but it is also completely contrary to the Ministry's intention to merge. I am specifically quoting the full text of the Ministry of Communications' instruction to clarify the truth: January 25, 1933, Instruction No. 377 of the Ministry of Communications to the China Aviation Construction Association: For your information, the construction of aviation is extremely important. At this time of national crisis, the whole country should work together and unify management. The Chinese Aviation Association, reorganized from the former China Aviation National Salvation Association, aims to gather the strength of the people of the whole country to assist the government in developing the aviation industry. This association is ordered to quickly contact it for merger in order to concentrate strength and jointly plan for progress. All the Ministry's approval for the association to register under No. 808 on August 20 of last year should be revoked immediately. Please be informed accordingly. This order, with a special letter for correction, with best wishes, China Aviation Construction Association, January 31st.</p>

<h3>Where is China's Problem?</h3>
<p>| Letter from Mr. Shen Zuguang |</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the current Chinese political organization is hopeless! But does being hopeless mean we should just accept it? That would be underestimating the Chinese people too much. However, the Chinese people have reached this stage and are still sound asleep, so we desperately want to roll up our sleeves and do something for the country. But we think, "If you prepare for something, you will succeed. If you don't prepare, you will fail." China has been reforming for twenty-two years, and the results have always been unsatisfactory! This is because of the problem of "doing things and then seeing how they go." So our idea is, if we don't act, then so be it, but if we are going to act, how should we act for China? This is a question that must be systematically and logically studied first. We have a premise: What does it mean to be a good country? A good government? My answer is very simple: "Everyone in the country lives in peace and prosperity." If we think carefully, the country is established by people; the reason people exist is to live. The reason China has become like this is that the Chinese people cannot live; that is, they cannot live in peace and prosperity. If people cannot live in peace and prosperity, it means the political organization is not good. But how can a political organization be considered good? This is the question. For twenty-two years, China has tried all kinds of political systems, and none of them have worked. Originally, each country has its own history, human feelings, customs, and habits. Whether it is the federal republic of the United States, or the constitutional monarchy of England and Japan, the national systems of each country are different, like axes, chisels, and adzes, each with its own use. It is good to seek what suits the national conditions and harmonizes with customs, why imitate others? I have friends who are university professors and news reporters, all around thirty years old. I asked them, is a republic and democracy good for Chinese politics? Or is a constitutional monarchy good? Their opinions mostly say, regardless of which system, as long as everyone can live in peace and prosperity, a republic is fine, and a monarchy is fine. I think everyone supports a republic and democracy, simply for the sake of the two words "civil rights." Looking at it now, where are civil rights? Life and property cannot be guaranteed! And you talk about civil rights. Everyone does not recognize the monarchy, simply because the monarch has the power of life and death, according to one person's will, which is not according to the law. But from a historical perspective, the monarch's power of life and death only applies to those who are appointed and receive salaries; in fact, if those who are appointed and receive salaries are let go, they will be like Han Liu in Shandong, and the two Lius in Sichuan, fighting each other! If the monarch imposes even a death penalty on the people, it is very solemn! (Like the pre-Qing dynasty, Yu Jue went through several levels of detailed interrogation, this is what I heard from old people.) It is definitely not like now, where killing a person is not even worth a dog! What kind of world is this? If China had a constitutional monarchy, perhaps the years and current warlord battles could be seen less often? I also think, for any organization with power, whether it is big or small, I think a dictatorial system is good. Although the United States is a republic, its president is Lincoln, and Stalin of Russia, are both dictatorships. Now those great men and gentlemen, who advocate democracy, are all ambitious and using it for their own benefit. If democracy has no leader, what will it become? Once you recognize a leader, you cannot but admire heroes! My friends also have their own views on supporting a constitutional monarchy, believing that the monarch is a figurehead, and a constitution has a congress, which is better than you now having no constitution! The people cannot speak! It is always better. I also remember when Hongxian failed, Yang Du had a telegram of self-blame, he said, constitutional monarchy, initiated by Yang Du; monarch's crime, the crime lies with Yang Du. He also said, the people elect a president, for a five-year term, which is five years of chaos. Although the presidential era is not long, his words have some reason. If the current situation is not changed, revolution, revolution, will革 away the lives of the people, and the life of the country! This is truly a tearful and unspeakable situation! I don't know if you will listen to what we have to say? Maybe you will say we are turning back the clock? I think there is no absolute good or bad political system, it all depends on governance by people. Therefore, King Zhuang of Chu appointed Sun Shuao, Duke Huan of Qi used Guan Zhong, and Emperor Gaozu of Han trusted Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, and all of them achieved hegemony in the world. Therefore, Xunzi said, "Law is a tool of governance, not the source of governance being clear or turbid." This is recognizing governance by people, not recognizing rule of law. Liang Qichao wrote "The principles of 君政民政相　." He said, "My China has been spared from changing from many rulers to one ruler for two thousand years, and the country must suddenly become strong. In the past, the thirty-seven states of America, the twenty-five states of Germany, the twenty-four states of Italy, and the ninety-two feudal lords of Japan... when they were not united, those countries could not even be listed on the globe; when they were united, they each became powerful in two continents! Why? In the past, they exhausted their people in endless conflicts, cutting off their vitality, and consuming their wealth to satisfy the private desires of their rulers; uniting them into one, they avoided this difficulty, which is why one ruler can achieve a moderately prosperous society." If Liang's words are correct, then a constitutional monarchy is of course reasonable! A federal system conflicts with his argument. Sir, you are wise, please teach us.</p>

Before the meeting, the city party department was not notified, and police from the Public Security Bureau came out to interfere. The representative of the Teachers' Association requested instructions from the city party department by telephone. After the city party department sent representative Hu Jiachun to contact the police, the meeting was delayed until 3:30 p.m. The presidium consisted of Li Shuhua, Li Jianxun, Wang Jixu, Liu Shichuan, and He Jihong. He Jihong was elected as the chairman, and Yuan Zhengui recorded. The ceremony was performed as usual.</p>
<p>Reporting Items: First, Chairman He Jihong reported the significance of the meeting. Second, Standing Committee Member Cai Zengtang reported: 1. Over the past year, the Teachers' Association has been promoting educational funding for the development of university education. 2. Matters handled in terms of documents: (1) Urging the issuance of funds, (2) Refuting Minister Zhu's opinions on reorganizing education, (3) Opposing the suspension of liberal arts and law faculties in national universities and the closure of duplicate institutions, (4) Telegraphing the League of Nations to uphold justice on the Sino-Japanese issue, etc. 3.

Temporary expenditure of three southern trips for representatives is about 5,000 yuan, 5. There is a surplus of more than 1,500 yuan. Monthly income and expenditure statements have been sent to each college and university and representatives of each college and university attending the meeting. Next, Standing Committee Member Yang Likui reported on the situation of comforting the anti-Japanese soldiers. Then, the discussion of each case began.</p>
<p>Motions Passed: 1. How should the colleges and universities collect and donate funds to the fighting soldiers at the front? Resolution: Starting from January of this year, 10% of the total higher education funding in Peiping and Tientsin will be donated monthly, limited to two months. The association will notify each college and university to handle it accordingly. 2. How should the use of the donated funds be stipulated? Resolution: It will be handled by the Standing Committee of the Teachers' Association for review. 3. How should effective assistance work be researched? Resolution: The Standing Committee of the Teachers' Association will study it in detail, and each member will contribute their opinions to the association at any time. 4.

Temporary motion: Send a letter to each college and university to add some people to participate in the Standing Committee of the Teachers' Association to study anti-Japanese work. Resolution: Passed. The Standing Committee of the Teachers' Association will decide on the number of people and how each college and university should elect them. The association will notify each college and university to handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>Anti-Opposition Talk: The most intense debate occurred during the discussion of Article 4, which was "How should representatives be elected to report to all sectors of society in domestically convenient locations and to contact assistance to the anti-Japanese work?" There were quite a few people who advocated not sending representatives to various places for propaganda, among whom Ms. Zhou Yuanyi, a female member, was the main figure. After Ms. Zhou spoke, the audience applauded in agreement. Later, after the eloquence of Jia Chengzhang and Liu Shichuan, when the vote was taken, it passed the "Motion to elect representatives to go to domestically convenient locations, report to all sectors of society, and contact assistance to the anti-Japanese work." After the meeting adjourned, Ms. Zhou had the following conversation with the reporter: "The members attending today's meeting are less than one-tenth of the total membership. There are more than a thousand members in total. It is quite illegal for a meeting with a small number of attendees to pass the motion to elect representatives to go to domestically convenient locations, report to all sectors of society, and contact assistance to the anti-Japanese work. We must awaken the people for the anti-Japanese movement, but it is superfluous for the Teachers' Association to send representatives to domestically convenient locations to publicize to all sectors of society. In areas with convenient transportation, there are newspapers to read, and almost everyone knows the necessity of resisting Japan. Moreover, the people in the transportation locations are already engaged in the anti-Japanese movement. Why does our association need to send representatives to publicize? As for reporting the situation on the front line, it is also inappropriate, because the situation on the front line is constantly changing. Can the Teachers' Association representatives' one-time inspection of the situation on the front line be used as permanent reporting material? At present, our association's funds are not sufficient, so it must spend a lot of money to provide travel expenses for the representatives. It is agreed in principle that the faculty and staff of various colleges and universities will donate 20% of their two-month salaries to the anti-Japanese soldiers at the front, but I absolutely oppose using a portion of this money for travel expenses for the representatives. It is okay for the faculty and staff of various colleges and universities to donate a portion of their hard-earned salaries to the anti-Japanese soldiers, but it is not okay to use this money to subsidize the travel expenses of the representatives. In fact, sending letters and telegrams can already achieve the purpose of publicity, and there is no need to waste public funds and be used as travel expenses for a few people."</p>
<p>Letter to Various Colleges and Universities: Dear Sir, The General Assembly of Faculty and Staff of National Colleges and Universities in Peiping and Tientsin resolved today that the colleges and universities should donate funds to the fighting soldiers at the front for the purpose of purchasing heavy trucks and other military supplies. 10% of the amount of higher education funding will be deducted monthly for a period of two months. Please retain the donations that have already been deducted from the funding items of the colleges and universities in January. We will send another letter to request payment when needed. Accordingly, we send this letter and ask you to handle it accordingly. Sincerely, Peiping and Tientsin National Colleges and Universities Faculty and Staff Federation, 28th. (Sent on the 28th)</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau of this city, in order to review the academic status of transferred students from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, specially issued an order to the schools in this city: In accordance with the regulations, the new students and transfer students reported by the middle schools in this city are reviewed by the bureau after the certificate documents are verified, so as to ensure accuracy and avoid luck. Since the "September 18th Incident" occurred, all schools in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have been reduced to war zones. Whether the academic status of the students transferred to the middle schools in this city is reliable is impossible to verify before the "Northeast China Incident" is resolved. In order to prevent fraud, the Bureau formulated the "Measures for Reviewing the Academic Status of Transferred Students from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang", which was approved by the 251st Bureau Affairs Meeting. Hereby, a copy of the measures is sent to the school. In the future, all transferred students from the three northeastern provinces should submit the entrance examination papers or other documents submitted by the student to the bureau for review, in addition to the certificate documents from the original school. You are hereby notified. This order.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association</h3>
<p>Hujiang Defeats Huadong</p>
<p>50 to 28</p>
<p>Datong Defeats Xiaguang 46 to 29</p>
<p>Tonight, Nanxing vs. Qingguang</p>
<p>Last night, the focus of the Shanghai Basketball Association was on the match between Hujiang and Huadong. The audience at the China Basketball Hall was also more enthusiastic. However, the difference in score was unexpected. As a result, Hujiang won by a score of 50 to 28. In the first half, Huadong only scored eight points, while Hujiang scored as many as twenty-three. In another Group A match, Xiaguang was defeated by Datong due to incomplete personnel. The score was 46 to 29. Tonight, in Group A, there is only one match between Nanxing and Qingguang. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Yaoguang vs. Feifei B2 5:30 PM Chen Fuzhang</p>
<p>Jingguang vs. Muer B3 6:30 PM Lu Zhongen</p>
<p>Youai vs. Liangxi B1 7:30 PM Yue Xiurong</p>
<p>Nanxing vs. Qingguang A1 8:30 PM Li Zuqi</p>
<p>Before the match between Datong and Xiaguang, it was expected that Xiaguang would win. Unexpectedly, Xiaguang's prestige was greatly reduced, and their fighting strength was weak, mainly due to incomplete personnel. On the other hand, Datong surpassed their predecessors, and their basketball skills were improving day by day. During the engagement, the situation was disparate. The score in the first half was doubled, with Datong winning 22 to 11. The final score was 46 to 29. Han Weixin of Datong scored 25 points alone, which was not easy.</p>
<p>The Hujiang team now belongs to the Donghua Football Club, but the team name still uses Hujiang. Due to registration procedures, it is not yet convenient to allow the name change. Since Wu Guolin left Shanghai, the center position has been replaced by Lu Zhongen, and the strength has not diminished. The Huadong team is mainly composed of Chizhi players, but where is the prestige of the past now? One cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitude. At the start of the game, Huadong took the lead with 4 to 0, but from then on, the record stagnated, with few achievements. Hujiang launched attacks one after another and was very smooth. In the first half, they reversed the situation and defeated Huadong by a large margin of 23 to 8. The situation in the afternoon was more tense, and there were many exciting performances. Huadong strengthened its defense, and Qian Dingshen scored a lot of points. Hujiang took advantage of the victory and did not show any weakness, sharing the honors equally, each with its own achievements. As a result, Hujiang won by a score of 50 to 28.</p>

<h3>Rumors of US Issuing Paper Money</h3>
<p>Gold Price Drops Slightly by 3 Liang and 3 Qian</p>
<p>Lingering Around 780 Liang All Day</p>
<h3>City Overview</h3>
<p>After a slight increase the day before yesterday, the market saw a decline yesterday. Although it rose by 3 liang the day before yesterday, it was still far from the downward trend in the silver market during the four-day closure. Therefore, those who took positions the day before yesterday immediately expected the silver market to rise. Yesterday's telegrams showed that London large bars, both near-term and far-term, rose by 125, and both the British-American and American-British exchange rates rose by more than half a point. The New York silver price increased by 375. The far-term silver price on the Metal Exchange rose by 5 to 40 points. Although American cotton fell by more than 10 pounds, bank private telegrams showed an increase of 375. Therefore, the gold market opened slightly lower, at 784.5 liang, with very good sentiment, pushing it to 786 liang. However, the exchange rate remained strong. China Banking Corporation first issued March American dollars at 28.625 yuan. Citibank also sold the same month at 6875, which turned downstream. HSBC quoted British flat and American up 125. By then, the gold price had fallen to around 2 liang, so there was no movement. Furthermore, because May American dollars were trading at 75, banks gradually came out, and it fell to 81 liang. However, sentiment remained stable, and buyers also surged, so it was pulled up. Later, due to the Central Bank opening cash several times, it rose to 786.9 qian. Unfortunately, the banks always remained in the lead position of selling, and March 6875 continued to come out, retreating to 84.1 qian at the midday close. The afternoon started calmly, but later the sellers gradually became active, and it once fell to 80.06 qian, because March American dollars were still trading at 75. Banks' appetites gradually increased, and the gold price repeatedly rose and fell. Although there were rumors that the Central Bank would open cash twice, it was not confirmed, so the price trended upward. Furthermore, it was heard that the Central Bank seemed willing to open cash at 2.5, and it once pushed up to 85 liang. However, rumors of the US issuing paper money came, and the gold price saw another setback, falling by more than 2 liang. Later, the market situation tended to be flat, hovering between 2 and 3 liang. Finally, it closed at 782.7 qian. The market situation fluctuated throughout the day, and sentiment was stable.

The trend seemed to be withering, but the spot goods were not surging, so the transaction was extremely unharmonious.</p>
<h3>Swap Stagnant</h3>
<p>The swap was extremely silent, because there were not many positions. There were no transactions heard in the morning yesterday, and the spot numbers had not yet started, so there were even fewer transactions. There was slight activity in the afternoon.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>｜Retail Investors Show Strong Appetite...Large Investors Rarely Sell｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange did not fall back due to the deteriorating situation. Although trading on the floor was not high, retail investors bought in small amounts, showing a strong appetite. However, as the silver and money industries had not yet taken any action, and distant merchants had mostly not yet arrived, the opening bids were slightly weak, but there were still increases and decreases. The second round of bids uniformly rose by 3 to 5 jiao. Trading gradually declined, with a total of 3,821,000 yuan traded in the two morning sessions. There was still no market in the afternoon, resulting in a slight increase of 2 to 3 jiao to 7 to 8 jiao compared to the previous day, with the spot price for liquidation being slightly lower by 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Mixed</h3>
<p>A report from the Newfeng Foreign Firm stated that on Monday (the 30th), the New York stock market showed mixed performance.

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Falls, Actual Demand Stagnant, Yarn and Cloth Prices Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the trend of falling prices is intensifying. This is because the overseas yarn and cotton situation is deteriorating, affecting the cotton market. The closely related yarn market is also declining. At the same time, actual demand is stagnant, leading to extreme weakness in sentiment. However, some believe that due to the spring season, there is continuous hope for sales to customers, and they are not loosening their grip on the bullish side. However, national crisis, the decline of inland commerce, and very tight monetary conditions are all unfavorable to yarn sales.</p>
<h3>Man-Biao Decreases, Downward Pressure Increases</h3>
<p>In the early market for Man-Biao, foreign cotton prices fell. Due to the lack of buyers in the market, prices for various months fell by 7 to 8 qian.

<h3>Spot Yarn Momentum Weakens Sharply</h3>
<p>The disposal of spot yarn has suddenly slowed down due to the volatile raw cotton prices.

Purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland　71　Guangdong　45　Fujian　10</p>
<p>Xiamen　25　Shantou　50　Colleagues　45</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Cheap, American Cotton Low, the Entire Cotton Market is Hit</h3>
<p>The cotton market is plunging sharply, with a very weak trend. This is because Indian cotton is being sold cheaply by various foreign firms in the market, with prices 7.5 qian lower than yesterday. American cotton has also fallen by 15 points, causing sudden panic. The entire cotton market has been broken down. Future trends will depend on the American and Indian cotton markets.</p>
<h3>Zheng-Biao Plunges Sharply by 8 to 9 Qian</h3>

<h3>More Foreign Cotton is Being Used</h3>

<h3>Biao Flour Factories Have Customers Returning</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for various months showed a weak and quiet trend. Although foreign wheat prices continued to improve by about 1 jiao, actual sales were limited due to the Lunar New Year, resulting in a quiet and lifeless sales market. Although spot goods were extremely tight before the market closed, they have now loosened. Moreover, due to the inability to sell foreign wheat, factories such as Xinda have slightly reduced their offerings, causing the market sentiment to gradually decline. Recently, flour prices have been weak, mainly due to sluggish actual sales. Old Bingship, Laoche futures and spot goods are still priced at an additional 7.5 fen, miscellaneous brands at an additional 5.5 fen. As a result, the current month fell by another 2 fen and 2 li and a half compared to the previous day, March fell by 2.5 fen, and April, May, and June each fell by 1 fen and 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Decline Step by Step</h3>
<p>｜Huge Chips...Impossible to Defend｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures continued to fall. Although foreign wheat prices improved by nearly 1 jiao, the poor flour sales caused the wheat market to become depressed. As the current foreign wheat prices are still low, imports will continue to arrive. Although dealers still want to defend their holdings and have no intention of selling, the chips are huge, and sentiment is bearish. Therefore, trading is sluggish, and prices are declining step by step. As a result, the current month fell by 7 fen compared to before the market closed, March fell by 4 fen, and April fell by 3 fen.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Merchants Continue to Purchase Customer Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of customer Xian rice continued to fall by 1 jiao. This price is now suitable for merchants to transport from customer ports. Therefore, the appetite of Fuzhou merchants suddenly increased, purchasing around 2,000 bags. Quanzhou merchants selectively purchased customer Yuan rice. Although the amount of rice in the market is small, the base is still solid, and the price has only slightly weakened by a few fen. Machine-milled red rice has also held its ground due to the shortage of goods. The overall market saw Fuzhou merchants purchase 1,306 bags of Jiangxi late-season machine-milled rice at prices ranging from 9 yuan and 1 jiao and a half to 9 yuan and 5 fen, with average quality ranging from 9 yuan to 8 yuan and 8 to 9 jiao. Another 200 bags of machine-milled red rice were purchased at 8 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and 700 bags of Hunan machine-milled oily rice at prices ranging from 9 yuan and 2 jiao to 8 yuan and 8 jiao and 7 fen. Quanzhou merchants purchased 143 bags of rough-milled machine-milled Yuan rice at 1,009 jiao and 8 fen, and 150 bags of average-quality Jiangxi machine-milled Yuan rice at 10 yuan and 5 jiao and 10 yuan. There is no good prospect for the market in the short term. This is because the price of river rice sold unofficially in the South City yesterday was lowered by 1 jiao, making sentiment weak. Only continuous and active customer purchases can gradually improve the market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Stable Without Progress</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains was stable. Dingjiazhou yellow soybeans were traded for 1,000 bags. Dasheng Daily Sutra</p>
<h3>(1) Opening of the White Willow</h3>
<p>"Business Sutra" is originally a kind of experience in doing business, which can also be said to be a knack. This knack is nothing more than saying how to make this business successful and how to sell this batch of goods. In order to achieve this goal, the methods, means, language, jokes, etc. used are generally called "Business Sutra".</p>
<p>The purpose of this column continuing these three words is to introduce the "Business Sutra" used in doing business to the readers of this newspaper. The reason is that general consumers have a similar feeling, that is, it is easy to use things but difficult to buy things. The difficulty lies in the fact that there are so many commodities related to people's daily life, and it is not easy to know how to buy these commodities. That is, this column cannot solve them one by one, but if the articles related to daily clothing, food, etc. can be explained, it is not without some ways to obtain some insights in the consumer aspect, which can be used as a reference when buying things. Then, the opening of this style may not be without some convenience to consumers.</p>
<p>However, there are various kinds of commodities, which cannot be generalized. Readers still need to draw inferences from one instance, especially what can be promoted by pen and ink is only a general outline. Inevitably, there are shortcomings. If you want to expand and correct it, I hope to get the support of the readers. As for the manuscripts in this column, in addition to specially invited contributions from people in various industries, contributions are still welcome. (1) Contributions should take a single commodity as a descriptive unit, regardless of literary or vernacular language, each should be about 300 to 400 words; (2) Once a contribution is published, it will be paid handsomely, but the copyright belongs to this newspaper; (3) If there are multiple submissions of the same manuscript or plagiarism, once discovered and verified, no payment will be made; (4) The submitted items will be disclosed by this newspaper at any time, and the time limit cannot be specified. Whether it is published or not, it will not be returned; (5) Each manuscript must separately state the real name, correspondence address, and seal or signature style; (6) If there are any questions about the submitted manuscript, the contributor shall be invited to the museum for face-to-face consultation and shall not refuse.</p>
<p>Five cars of Lianzhu soybeans were purchased by merchants in the inner city and Guangdong, but the factories remained unmoved. 300 bags of Pudong Duzhu soybeans were imported into the street. The future of the soybean market is that the sales are ordinary, and cities such as Dalian are also weakening, so it is easy to fall in Shanghai but difficult to rise. Mung beans are still only consumed by small Luzon and Hong Kong, with a total of more than 130 bags of Guandian large-grain vegetable mung beans and 200 bags of Ming mung beans being traded. Jiangbei mung beans were purchased by Xiamen merchants. 200 bags of long beans were taken by Little Luzon. Sesame seeds are sold in a light manner, and the market is softening. 200 bags of red grains were taken by Jiangbei merchants, and the market is still stable. Although raw peanuts and peanuts are traded, the market is soft due to the thick supply and slow sales. Although the oil market has not yet officially opened, the market may have to be reorganized.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Tea House Policies Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>However, tens of thousands of yuan have been released along the Sui'an Road</p>
<p>There are no less than 20 local tea houses in this port that deal with Ping Shui tea. They are the hub of the tea industry in terms of financial receipts and disbursements and business dealings. Due to the high prices of inland tea last year, the sale of foreign green and black tea in Shanghai had fallen without rising, causing most tea houses to suffer slight losses. Since the final accounts were closed, Hong Yuancheng, Yuan Fengrun, Zhongxinchang, Yong Shengchang, Yong Xinglong, Sheng Changsheng, Gong Shengyong, etc. have successively determined this year's business policy, which is generally unchanged. However, many tea houses along Sui'an Road are paying attention. It is heard that tens of thousands of yuan have been released one after another.</p>
<p>Grain Market</p>
<h3>Coarse Sand and White Mark Prices Drop Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grain market's trend was slightly weak due to the lack of large sales. The association's pricing was 24 coarse sand and white mark at 15 taels, 7 qian, and 7 fen and a half, which was slightly lower than the previous day by 2 fen and a half. 20 medium sand and white marks were priced at 15 taels and 4 qian. 89 Hechi marks were priced at 12 taels, 4 qian to 3 qian and a half.

The factory's small bag of ice No. 1 opened at 17 taels and 8 qian, and No. 2 at 17 taels and 7 qian.</p>
<p>Chao Merchants' Rules Have Been Resolved</p>
<p>The Chao merchants and the sugar industry had changes in their rules due to the issue of changing the market scale. Yesterday, the two parties reached a decision after consultation at the old public hall in the South City, which will be implemented as long as the two parties notify their peers today. The key points of the decision are recorded as follows: (1) Silver term: The deadline is 10 days from the date the transaction is written on the ticket; (2) Warehouse rent: Starts one month later; (3) The shipment must be cleared within three months; (4) Fire insurance is limited to three months (paid by the house); (5) When the silver term expires, the bank will first pay the house with the goods and silver, and then the house will send the bill of lading to the bank; (6) The packaging skin is stipulated to be 2 jin and 12 taels per bag (market scale).</p>

<p>In the 21st year, the sugar industry was affected by the Shanghai war in the first half of the year, and the business was inevitably affected.

<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>A Review of Last Year's Oil and Hemp Business</h3>
<p>The tung oil and ramie industry has gradually declined in the past four or five years, and even more so last year. The business has not increased compared to the previous year. The reasons are as follows: 20 years ago, old prefectures such as Jinhua, Quzhou, Wenzhou, Yanzhou, etc. in Zhejiang Province and counties in the upper reaches of Hangzhou Prefecture all developed barren mountains and planted tung trees. In the past ten years, the production volume has increased sharply. The area where Hantong was sold has become a production area. Oil and hemp houses in this port used to purchase from Hankou and sell to inland cities and towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Zhejiang production has accumulated and is cheaper than Han production. The business in this port has gradually been occupied by Zhejiang production. Although Zhejiang sales have been cut off, local provinces can still be maintained. Zhejiang tung oil sales to Jiangsu Province require a tax of 7 jiao and 2 fen per load. After the tax cards were abolished, the obstacles were removed, and Zhejiang tung oil sales to Jiangsu were unobstructed. Shanghai used to rely on foreign customs as a talisman, but now there is nothing to rely on to resell inland. The business opportunity is on the verge of extinction. This white tung oil is affected by the sharp increase in Zhejiang production and the abolition of tax. The main business of Hantong oil has been completely plundered. However, Hongjiang tung oil may be able to maintain a part of it. However, the history of Hongtong oil shows that before the establishment of tax cards, the market was concentrated in Suzhou. Later, due to the difficulty of transportation for merchants due to the establishment of numerous tax cards in the interior, this port could rely on foreign customs to transport and resell. The market has gradually shifted to Shanghai for decades. After the abolition of the tax, the business of Hongjiang tung oil in Suzhou is gradually booming, and it is expected to restore the state before the establishment of tax cards decades ago. Since the heavy tax has been lifted, there is no obstacle to loading and unloading, and Suzhou is located in the center of Zhejiang Province's Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou and Jiangsu Province's Suzhou, Songjiang, and Changzhou, with traffic in all directions, which is far more convenient than Shanghai's remote coastal location. Due to the guidance of the situation, there should be a new trend. Therefore, the tung oil industry in this port has come to an end. This is also a drastic change in the market. Last year's business in the oil and hemp industry in this port was suspended in the first half of the year due to the war. Although it can be operated in the second half of the year, the scope of business is limited to one corner due to the above-mentioned various influences. The state of decline has reached the extreme. If no other attempts are made, it will be eliminated. It is hoped that those engaged in this business will seek new paths to find a way out. As for those who have made profits among the various houses, they are those who also operate hemp, so hemp can still make profits last year. If you specialize in tung oil, it is difficult to get a surplus.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Idle Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>Beauty and Ugliness</p>
<p>"Above are the heavens, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou." This is a compliment to the Jiangnan region that has been passed down for thousands of years. Today, the heavenly status of Suzhou and Hangzhou has been usurped by Shanghai. Although Suzhou and Hangzhou have natural scenery, they ultimately cannot match the artificial beauty of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Everything in Suzhou and Hangzhou is fashionable because it is Shanghaied. Shanghai people, however, consider Westernization to be fashionable and would never deign to imitate the things of the people of Suzhou and Hangzhou. The people of Suzhou and Hangzhou are influenced by Shanghai life, and they never tire of living in Shanghai as gentlemen of leisure. Shanghai people, if they happen to go to Suzhou and Hangzhou for a day or two, will feel inconvenienced in their lives. Apart from the real mountains and real rivers, everything else is not as beautiful as in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly a beautiful place! Especially Shanghai at night. People are intoxicated by the red lights. Looking up at the tall Western-style buildings of more than ten stories, they will feel the insignificance of their own bodies. On Jing'an Temple Road, Xiafei Road, and other places, there are many mansions of the wealthy. From among the towering pavilions and lush bamboo forests, strains of delicate music can be heard. From afar, one can see one or two fashionable girls either appearing or disappearing inside. They truly seem like immortals. The poor scholars, upon seeing them, will have all sorts of reveries in their hearts.</p>
<p>However, in Shanghai, there are many people who live in the "cracks." If we do not have the eyes to see through things, we will not be able to see their cramped state. It is very common for seven or eight families to live in a one-story or two-story house. Of course, the upstairs and downstairs are full of beds, and in the space between the floor and the ceiling, attics can be built to live in. Are these people not living in the cracks of the houses? How can you see their lives as you walk on the wide roads?</p>
<p>Shanghai is like a white porcelain manure pipe, with a shiny exterior, as beautiful as white jade. If the pipe is broken, the yellow and white matter inside will be revealed, making it look incomparably ugly!</p>
<p>In the waiting room of a hospital specializing in venereal diseases, a beautiful girl is sitting. She is dressed very beautifully, and there are absolutely no blemishes on her face. After a short while, the doctor asks her to take off her clothes, and one can see that her whole body is covered with spots, filled with syphilitic sores. The beauty and ugliness of Shanghai is also similar to that of this young lady. To paint the face!"</p>
<p>I laughed. In my heart, I thought... In the snowy mountains of the north, the blood of soldiers is still flowing, as red as rouge. It would be very good to use it as cosmetics for Chinese girls!</p>
<h3>Women's Red Satin Trousers</h3>
<p>— Yan Bōguāng</p>
<p>In January 1933, several fashionable girls, competing to show off their beauty, permed their hair into curly waves to beautify their beautiful hair, weaved fine eyebrows, had lightning-like lively eyes, cherry-like vermilion lips, qipaos more than four feet long, red satin trousers with embroidered edges, and high-heeled leather shoes with black lacquer flowers... She walked with winding artistic steps, entering and exiting major theaters and movie theaters.</p>
<p>Can her outfit save the country? Yes, she learned the alluring style of a star in several extremely famous Chinese films, and she also learned the heroic spirit of Mulan joining the army. She was not seen carrying a gun, nor was she seen going out to the pass to kill thieves. No, she was saving the country with fashion.</p>
<p>The gorgeous red trousers seduced the pursuit of young men in Western suits, who were intoxicated in her warm embrace, as if a servant could not leave his nanny. A shallow smile and a light frown, how happy he was to see. He praised her beautiful hair, saying it was like a</p>
<h3>Indulgent and Base</h3>
<p>— Páng Zǐsū</p>
<p>It seems that twenty years ago, the Japanese used the four words "indulgent and base" to describe Chinese students studying in Japan. At that time, Chinese students thought this was a great humiliation, so they were very indignant.</p>
<p>However, what about today, twenty-two years later? Heh... Aren't they still inheriting this old family business of "indulgent and base"?</p>
<p>Nothing can be believed without evidence, so let's look at the facts...</p>
<p>People walking on the road always like to throng in the middle of the road, as if they are preparing to fight motorcycles to the death.</p>
<p>Buying tickets at the train station, watching plays in the theater, getting on and off the tram, they are always impolite to each other. Those who come later want to be first, and those who arrive first fall behind.</p>
<p>In restaurants, it is necessary to play drinking games to be considered enjoyable, and it is necessary to have a mess of dishes and plates to be considered happy.</p>
<p>Playing cards and singing operas in hotels all night long is common practice. If you can't fall asleep and try to persuade them to be quiet, not only will they not apologize, but they may even say that you are interfering with their freedom.</p>
<p>Everywhere on the streets, you can see fights, and everywhere in the alleys, you can hear scolding.</p>
<p>At random, it is enough to expose all the bad habits of China, such as not keeping order, not respecting the freedom of others, and other inferior characteristics. Friends! Stop inheriting this "indulgent and base" family business!</p>
<h3>Chōng Village Reads Snow</h3>
<p>— Huǒ Xuěmíng</p>
<p>On New Year's Day of the lunar calendar, there was no sun, and the sky was full of pale gray clouds. The streets were deserted.</p>
<p>Only in the ancient market on the west side of the town were rural men gambling and village girls burning incense. This one</p>
<h3>Wild Song as Mourning</h3>
<p>— Shí Yǔ</p>
<p>| Lamenting the Deng Tiemei Department Frozen to Death in Xiuyan |</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read in the "Random Talks from the Violet Anemone Chamber" by brother Juan about the 380 members of Deng Tiemei's department who were frozen to death in Xiuyan. Even after death, they still held guns and knives, which is more righteous and heroic than the 500 men of Tian Heng. For to hold thousands of spears and defend the country is different from sacrificing oneself for a close friend. And he hoped that men of letters and scholars would sing about it to highlight their loyalty and righteousness. I am ashamed of my lack of literary talent, but I勉勉为韵语寄投本栏.</p>
<p>Ice railing hundreds of feet, snow covering the thighs, fierce wind cutting like knives, freezing blood purple, harsh cold cruelty, dying on the same day, three hundred and eighty righteous and brave warriors, trapped in Xiuyan, Deng Tiemei's department, food and clothing exhausted, life gone, souls not forgetting to kill the enemy, sharp weapons in hand, eyes staring straight, alas, good sons defending the country, the heavens not pitying them like this, in those years, the five hundred men on the desolate island, committing suicide with swords at the same time to repay their friend, their magnificent bravery still flows for thousands of years, how much more so not dying for one person, nameless heroes, true heroes, doing what their hearts tell them to do for the country, powerful enemies surrounding them with tens of thousands of cavalry, still fearing the righteous army's firm resistance, after a long time without sound, searching into the mountains, shocked to see hundreds of frozen corpses, tigers and wolves cruel, also sighing, knowing that our compatriots all wipe away tears, wiping away tears, grieving in vain, shouldering spears to kill the enemy, rising up together, the bandit's depth deep, the strong pass already lost, eyes cracking, asking who is scheming for the country,</p>

<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>— Hú Tīwéi</p>
<p>"What time is it now?"</p>
<p>Hongye heard her mother say that sick people are most afraid of asking about the time, and immediately sensed that the illness was not good,</p>
<p>"Three twenty-five."</p>
<p>"Go get a pen and paper!"</p>
<p>Hongye didn't understand what it was for, and didn't dare to ask. She held the pen and looked at her father, and at the same time felt the need to notify her mother and brothers to get up.</p>
<p>Father still closed his eyes... "I thought of two elegies myself. You write them down for me, "The setting sun knows, the bright moon returns to the truth." After I die, Elder Fang from S Village, who has been a family friend for three generations, will definitely come to offer condolences. You can ask Fang Elder to write them and hang them on my spirit."</p>
<p>Hongye finished listening to his father, teardrops already soaked half of the letter paper. She quickly called her mother and brothers up, and one by one they quietly entered the room to sit and watch. After a while, it dawned, and her mother told Hongye to go to sleep, but Hongye didn't want to. She watched for another two hours, and her father slept soundly. Hongye felt that she couldn't hold on any longer, so she left the room and went to bed. In her mind, there were only the eight words "The setting sun knows, the bright moon returns to the truth," surging like a raging tide, and she didn't know if it was sweat or tears, soaking the pillow.</p>
<p>She didn't know how long she was in a daze when Hongye's brother came to call her, saying that father was not well. Hongye rushed into the room, her mother's face covered with tears, holding her father's hand...</p>
<p>"Hongye, father's hands are cold, call out!"</p>
<p>Hongye hugged her father's white-haired head, attached it to his ear, and her tears that never dried dripped on her father's haggard, emaciated cheeks...</p>
<p>"Dad... Dad..."</p>
<p>Poor father, no matter how loudly Hongye shouted, he would not open his last line of sight of his eyes, he couldn't hear! He couldn't see!</p>
<p>Hometown, a hometown six hundred li away! Every year on this most painful and memorable day, Hongye always rushes back to his father's grave and kowtows respectfully. During this short journey, the special express train swallowing white coal and spitting out black smoke, the small hotels where the wealthy insects stay, the C River with sandy sails and a crescent moon, the long-distance bus that goes up to the heavens and down to the underworld, and, of course, the green mountains, the precarious city walls, the skillful wine jar mountain, the stone archway praising chastity, the mosquitoes chirping and seeking each other, and everything else! Of course, there is also a loving mother, friendly brothers, all safe and sound every year. Only those most touching emaciated cheeks, the white-haired forehead, the two chubby feet in the black leather slippers, are never seen again! (The End)</p>
<p>The annual excitement will, as usual, cause excitement and joy for the tired villagers.</p>
<p>Pulling up the collar of his overcoat, burying his felt hat on his head, he turned to this temple fair. The north wind was blowing so hard that the bald trees were roaring loudly. The tall trees stood tall, with not a single leaf left. The branches trembled slightly, and the residual grass on the wild ground swelled into yellow waves. I stood in this wave, listening to the wind, and I felt lonely and cold. There was a little jealousy of those who were gambling and burning incense.</p>
<p>Broken, the sound of the wind was like the tide, the cloud feet dragged lower, and it was snowing. Powder-like, catkin-like, falling flower-like, the space was filled with these white demons, point by point. He immediately thought of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty's poem about snow...</p>
<p>"One piece, two pieces, three or four pieces, five pieces, six pieces, seven or eight pieces, ninety-one hundred pieces, thousands of pieces..." It is truly a good poem that expresses the feeling of being in the scene. It has the leisurely mood of watching the snow begin to fly, and such a happy and cheerful mood. Mr. Ji Xiaolan thought he was very clever and ended with the last sentence... "Flying into the pear blossoms and disappearing." In fact, there is not much fun to be felt. It is only to match the so-called seven-character quatrain passed down from ancient times, which must have only twenty-eight characters.</p>
<p>I also chanted the Emperor's good poem and returned home step by step. I was covered in snow.</p>
<p>It just so happened that my nephew was catching snowflakes in the yard, freezing his fingers red as he carried them into bottles, jars, and paper bags... As soon as he saw me coming, he ran to me with a smile and said...</p>
<p>"Uncle, the heavens are dropping so much snow cream, but female poet saint, her eyes were like movie star Greta Garbo's. ...He asked her why she was wearing dazzling red trousers? She said... "The decline of Chinese silk is all because of people like you who love to wear Western suits. All you know is to wear beautiful Western suits and chase girls. If everyone in the country is like you, how can the country not perish? I wear red trousers to promote silk and save the country, not to charm people." He realized the truth and from then on did not use foreign goods, did not wear Western clothes, and made a determined decision to save the country. Whose credit is this?</p>

<h3>Intoxicated</h3>
<p>— Lan Guang</p>
<p>This happened half a year ago.</p>
<p>A tranquil atmosphere enveloped the hospital ward. A ghastly blue electric light emanated from within the ward, passing through the air vents above the doorframe. It took the form of a slanting rectangle on the stairs leading to the third floor, suddenly manifesting as an angel at the top of the stairs. She was barefoot, wearing snow-white soft-soled shoes. Her little feet, clad in snow-white socks, moved beneath the long slit of her cheongsam. She wore a silver coat—a nurse's outer garment. Her two rosy and plump cheeks bore shallow dimples, appearing even more beautiful in the pale blue light. Her wavy hair was covered by a white cap with a red cross, all possessing a charming allure.</p>
<p>She lightly tiptoed through the side door and walked to the patient's bedside. The patient, afflicted with typhoid fever, was struggling as if fighting death itself, constantly flailing his limbs. His eyes stared unblinkingly at the feeble light, anticipating annihilation along with the light. She gently tucked the woolen blanket around him and slowly walked away from the bed towards the stairs.</p>
<p>In a corner of the staircase, she seemed lost in thought. The sound of leather shoes suddenly vibrated in her ears. It was him, coming from the pharmacy, holding the patient's name tag in his hand, along with a bottle of mud-like medicine. His eyes looked up at her feet, unconsciously exerting force to lift his foot and step upward.</p>
<p>With about three steps left, a chaotic sound of footsteps arose behind him, followed by a chorus of voices shouting:</p>
<p>"Make way, make way, a patient is coming!"</p>
<p>It was a patient being carried up from the saline room, constantly shouting: "Want watermelon, iced jelly, sour... plum syrup!" He hurriedly moved toward the corner, but she was too late to dodge. Thus, his chest pressed tightly against her chest. He enjoyed a fleeting moment of fortune. A blush of rose-colored clouds appeared on her face, and she hastily turned towards the corner of the wall. He bent down to pick up the scattered prescription paper, now stained with shoe prints. He slowly walked into his office, sat in the chair, and as he picked up his pen, his mind was filled with this memory... silver-white coat, wavy hair, delicate and beautiful face, especially the soft and warm chest... he was intoxicated. The pen slipped from his hand, rolled off the desk, and the nib pierced into a crack in the board, swaying.</p>
<h3>Sleepless Night</h3>
<p>Night, quietly, silence occupied the land. Old Man Sandman forgot about me, and I still opened my eyes wide, staring at the outlines in the darkness. "Why can't I fall asleep yet?" I was annoyed, turned over, and counted one, two, three… but still did not see Old Man Sandman's arrival.</p>
<p>It seemed that falling asleep was impossible, so I had to open my eyes wide again and stare into the darkness. The sharp barking of dogs in the distance, like the howling of wolves in the deep mountains, made my heart tremble!</p>
<p>Disordered thoughts surged into my mind like a tide.</p>
<p>Thinking and thinking, my heart gradually became irritable, so I decided not to think, but more thoughts surged in, as if saying fiercely: "Humph, see if you can escape my control."</p>
<p>I muttered: "Heavens, is even a sound sleep at night not allowed after working hard all day?"</p>
<p>The small clock on the table chimed twelve times.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's twelve o'clock. Sleep! I have to get up at six o'clock tomorrow. If I sleep late, I won't have any energy to work!" I said to myself.</p>
<p>However, the thoughts were like wild horses, running even wilder. I thought of the red-cheeked girl I saw on the street during the day, smiling lightly, of the supervisor's devilish face, of the cotton robe still in the pawnshop, of the bandit's慷慨激昂 before execution, of the woman's snow-white feet, of…</p>
<p>The small clock on the table struck one, then two, then three. My thoughts were as chaotic as tangled silk threads. Dragging on and on, I didn't know how much time had passed. I heard it strike four, then five. What to do? Waiting and waiting, time seemed to pass even slower, and the disordered thoughts had also fled. I just stared blankly at the window, which was tinged with a faint light. The faint light slowly increased, finally reaching the dawn. Before long, the clock struck six, so I reluctantly struggled to get up, my body exhausted, and sighed softly... "Alas, this night!"</p>

<h3>The Melting of Snow</h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>"Snowfall is not as cold as snow remaining," this is what experience tells us.</p>
<p>However, this year's weather is very different from usual. Normally, after it snows in our Jiangnan weather, it wouldn't melt, nor would it accumulate. So when the snow melts, although it is cold, it is also cold in a refreshing way. But this year, the snow falls and falls, but refuses to melt at all. It seems that the world will be permanently locked down in white like this; and we humans, it seems, will right away have the hopes of a frozen crucian carp in the mud, to be frozen alive in the ice of the air. Ah! If it goes on like this, what kind of world will it be!</p>
<p>A few days ago, because there were still people making fires for warmth during the day, some people needed to cook, and even some people were talking and breathing, the eaves of our houses dripped with melting ice water. No matter how small this ice water was, to us, it also felt like a recovery of a lot of vitality and new hope.</p>
<p>We know very well that spring is coming, but watching the world freeze like this day after day, freezing our bodies and souls in severe ice and snow, those days are not easy to live through. Be patient, yes, patience is indeed our Chinese people's golden rule of conduct, but in this situation, in fact, even a moment, even a minute or a second, we can't bear it!</p>
<p>Have you ever seen colored glass rods and glass balls used to weigh down books or paper? Have you ever seen goldfish frozen in those glass balls? Have you ever seen two swallows with diagonally cut tails frozen in those glass rods? Yes, the way our souls are frozen is somewhat similar.</p>
<p>However, you may still be able to imagine one ten-thousandth of this situation, because it's just for fun, it's just a work of art made of lifeless special materials; you won't place any sympathy on the goldfish with its eyes wide open, ultimately unable to move, or on the pair of swallows with their clipped tails, ultimately unable to fly away, and worry about those lifeless things.</p>
<p>There's no way, let me give you another example! However, I don't know if you ever played the game of raising small fish when you were children? But for me, I have had such an experience.</p>
<p>In May or June, I caught many small fish and shrimp in a small stream. Because they were lively and cute, I raised them in a small tank at home. I was very afraid they would be uncomfortable with me, so I put a lot of green algae in it, and I let them hide in the rock caves of the artificial mountain and swim and play under the shade of the pine-like algae. I served them with rice grains or wheat flour every day. As soon as I sprinkled a few rice grains into the tank, they would recognize that food had arrived from the slight shattering sound on the surface of the water, and immediately run out from the rock cave or under the algae to eat. I almost had a spiritual connection with them, almost regarding them as a part of my life.</p>
<p>However, all the way to this year's cold winter, one night, a northwest wind suddenly arose in the air, and all the water turned completely into solid. Of course, inevitably, my small fish tank, the small fish tank that entrusted a part of my spirit, was also frozen from the root up. The next morning, when I hurried to see those little fish in the cold wind, ah, what a heartbreaking thing, they were all frozen in the whole block of ice, along with the rocks, aquatic plants, all frozen together. Oh, what a heartbreaking thing! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>New Year's New Dreams</h3>
<p>— Yang Qiu</p>
<p>The "new" "1932" has passed, and the "old" "Republic of China Year 21" has also passed. Naturally, no one is satisfied with the past year, so at the beginning of this new year, everyone is making new and satisfying dreams. This, we can clearly see from the spring couplets posted in front of the High Street Gate, such as "Business prospers and reaches the four seas, wealth flourishes and reaches the three rivers," etc., and the auspicious words posted in the study, such as "May the pen flourish in the new year, may great fortune and profit come," etc.</p>
<p>However, "business prospers, wealth flourishes," and "may the pen flourish in the new year, may great fortune and profit come" are ultimately just "dreams of getting promoted and becoming wealthy" centered on the individual. Moreover, such "dreams" seem to be just "I hope so," and have not clearly shown the meaning of "struggle."</p>
<p>The times have, after all, shattered the illusion of "getting promoted and becoming wealthy" centered on the "individual." You only see, although there are still people dreaming of "prosperous business" or "auspicious profits" at the beginning of this year, smart people have already been taught to be obedient by the times. They have already understood the meaning of "group," and even more understand the meaning of "our group" and "their group." They know that now it can't just be "I hope so," but should be "must be so," which means that now it is "necessary to struggle," not "individual against individual" struggle, but "our group against their group" struggle. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the call for "National Goods Year" and "Suppressing Communists Year" arose one after another.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of "National Goods Year" and "Suppressing Communists Year"? This means that "personal dreams" have been transformed into "group and group confrontation." Smart people are urgently hoping to be dragged out of the black tide of "panic" and "turmoil" in 1933.</p>
<p>Will this hope be shattered? 1933 probably won't fail to answer us.</p>
<h3>About "Rejecting Geniuses"</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yunping</p>
<p>Qifan Jun previously published an article "Rejecting Geniuses" in this newspaper's Free Talk, and later Huang Zhongxi Jun raised a question in the Readers' Advisory column. Originally, the columnist in the Readers' Advisory column already had a very good answer, so I don't need to say anything more, but I still have a few words I want to say.</p>
<p>The largest number of people in our society are mediocre people, ordinary people. Qifan Jun's words are completely correct. Even if there are geniuses, they are only a very small number, and these people are in society. In the past, too much emphasis was placed on "genius," so geniuses became "people above people," forming a social stratum that dominated mediocre people, and thus all kinds of deception, cruelty, and tyranny arose. This kind of genius should naturally be rejected.</p>
<p>We have a saying that goes "Eat the bitterest of bitterness, and you can become a person above people." These so-called "people above people" are undoubtedly the ruling class. Chinese history is so long, a large part of it is the monarchical era. Feudal ideology is really deeply rooted in the minds of the people. In order to become a "person above people," they do not hesitate to lose face, abandon personality, and drill around like dogs. Once they are successful, if they do not put on a full airs, it is not enough to show their "human tool"; if they are unsuccessful, they will make a mess, and if they are no longer useful, they will become decadent, degenerate, and romantic. We can say… Chinese politics, everything, is so chaotic, this is a big problem!</p>
<p>The evolution of society is not entirely due to the credit of geniuses. Genius is by no means a super-class thing. I fundamentally do not recognize the existence of the individual. The individual in the entire society is like a cell in our body. The strength of one cell is not enough to make the individual healthy. The strength of all the cells is what can make the whole body strong. The relationship between people and society is roughly the same. Social evolution is not the power of a mediocre person, nor is it the power of a genius. I don't know if there are still people who doubt it?</p>
<p>But geniuses cannot be completely written off. The so-called genius, simply put, means that one's intelligence and talent are one level higher than the average person. It is a pity that many geniuses, because they have this level of higher intelligence and talent, want to deceive and exploit the mediocre masses in order to form their "person above people" position. Let our Mr. Qifan call out "rejection" to everyone! If geniuses are willing to join the mediocre masses and help the mediocre masses, then we have no choice but to welcome geniuses.</p>
<p>I understand Qifan Jun's original intention in writing "Rejecting Geniuses." He has indeed seen the symptoms of political chaos and social inequality. It is only a pity that, as the columnist in the Readers' Advisory column said, he did not separate "genius" from "person above people." However, I have already said… "Genius" becoming a "person above people" is very easy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I dare to say this… if geniuses do not stand on our heads, we can welcome geniuses, otherwise, we must reject them. This society is fundamentally a society of mediocre people.</p>
<h3>The Song of the Petrel</h3>
<p>— Gorky, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>The petrel is a small seabird in the temperate zone with very long wings and black and white plumage. It is said that this seabird often appears before storms, so it is also called Stormy Petrel.</p>
<p>This poem is one of Gorky's most famous poems. In this poem, he symbolizes revolution with storms, and the petrel with revolutionary poets—it can also be said to be himself. Translator's note. Above the misty sea surface,</p>
<p>Dense clouds are whipped by the wind,</p>
<p>Between the dark clouds and the waves,</p>
<p>The petrel proudly sweeps past,</p>
<p>Like a dark flash of lightning.</p>
<p>·····················</p>
<p>For a while, its wings touch the waves,</p>
<p>For a while, it flies close to the dark clouds,</p>
<p>It cries out sharply,</p>
<p>In the midst of this jubilant and urgent storm;</p>
<p>Its cries report to the dark clouds…</p>
<p>Angry force, passionate flames,</p>
<p>The joy of future victory!</p>
<p>····················</p>
<p>Seagulls moan in the face of the storm,</p>
<p>Hurrying and scurrying,</p>
<p>Afraid of being buried in the unfathomable seabed.</p>
<p>Diving birds sigh,</p>
<p>Why sigh,</p>
<p>Because they don't feel the engaging joy of war,</p>
<p>And the rumbling thunder frightens them.</p>
<p>··················</p>
<p>Foolish penguins, timidly</p>
<p>Hide their bellies in caves.</p>
<p>Only the petrel is,</p>
<p>Independently, boldly,</p>
<p>Flying alone over the surging waves.</p>
<p>···················</p>
<p>The lowering dark clouds get darker and get closer,</p>
<p>The waves are eager to meet the thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Look! The thunderbolt rings out… boom,</p>
<p>The wind and waves rise up.</p>
<p>Look! The wind tightly embraces the waves,</p>
<p>Forcefully laying them horizontally on the edge of the rocks,</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a burst of fierce anger</p>
<p>Smashing the huge waves—emerald blocks—</p>
<p>Into foam and droplets.</p>

<p>Look! The petrel flies like it's sweeping,</p>

<p>It uses its wings to cut the waves into pieces.</p>
<p>·····················</p>
<p>Proud, dark, herald of the storm,</p>
<p>It mocks the thunderbolt's raging fury.</p>
<p>It is the wise and discerning demon…</p>
<p>In the rumbling thunder,</p>
<p>It has long seen and felt,</p>
<p>The signal of timid surrender…</p>
<p>It is confident in the victory of the sun's light and heat,</p>

<h3>Crossroads of Era and Love (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"You are the model of the youth of the newly emerging Republic of China!"</p>
<p>Although he thought so, as he stepped into the T teahouse and looked around, seeing no acquaintances who knew them, his ambition flared up again. He unnaturally reached out his right hand and slightly embraced Mrs. Hezi's lower back, and with their lips close, they walked up the escalator together. He was somewhat dazed, only hearing Mrs. Hezi say with a smile,</p>
<p>"I love Chinese cuisine."</p>
<p>She said "Chinese cuisine" using the Japanese pronunciation. After hearing it, he felt like he had been stung by a poisonous bee, and at the same time, he thought of the Japanese patrolmen going back and forth on North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>He felt a contradictory pain. So he sighed again.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, Mr. Lin, why are you so unhappy tonight?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hezi, sitting in the chair opposite him, was washing his teacup and wiping his chopsticks. Probably the temperature in the room had suddenly risen, and he saw that her cheeks were really red and very lovely. After she said this, she smiled at him sweetly.</p>
<p>"It's not that I'm unhappy. I just feel that life is really boring. You see, aren't we surrounded by such a decadent atmosphere?"</p>
<p>He forced a smile.</p>
<p>"That's why I say, life should be enjoyed in time, without regard to so many morals and laws…"</p>
<p>"·····················"</p>
<p>He thought, this is terrible, she completely misunderstood his words, and took advantage of it. He was silent and also restrained his beauty.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, a certain European writer said that life begins with stupid things, continues with stupid things, but ends with tears. This is life, and it is also a meaningful life!"</p>
<p>Her remarks startled Haiquan. She turned out to be a writer, and he shouldn't underestimate her.</p>
<p>"Do you also like literature and art?"</p>

<h3>Peiping Universities Get Rebuked</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from January 28th contains news about Peiping universities, which roughly says that our Ministry of Education believes that the various actions of Peiping universities, such as escaping exams and taking early vacations due to the tightening of the situation in Yuguan, are quite inappropriate. "It is found that university students are the backbone of the nation, how can they be allowed to be alarmed and ruin school rules, and 'the school authorities have not reported, which is close to condoning, and is also inappropriate,'" so it telegraphed to all Peiping universities, "The schools should quickly report the situation of students escaping exams and taking early vacations in detail for verification and handling, and report the date of the start of classes for the next semester as well."</p>
<p>Once this order was issued in the capital, needless to say, the schools, which were "also inappropriate," naturally had to submit a report in compliance with the order, needless to say. However, judging from this, the uselessness of Peiping university students, after being "verified and confirmed" by the central government, is indeed undeniably confirmed.</p>
<p>The government takes the blood and sweat of many common people to run universities, originally to cultivate "backbone elements" as "talents" to govern the country and bring peace to the world. Now, when this "national crisis is at hand," they not only cannot defend their "own" country and defend the homeland, but even just with the warning of the tightening of the situation in Yuguan, they "ruin school rules" and flee in a puff of smoke. Isn't this too ungrateful to the national education? Moreover, even if we take a hundred steps back, even if Japanese imperialism immediately attacked Peiping, it would not be too late to abandon their seals and flee with the officials defending the land at that time. Although they might not be able to win the patriotic fame of "perishing with the city," at least they would not lose the responsibility of "backbone elements," right? Moreover, Peiping is still a dignified "cultural city," how can it be asserted that the Japanese imperial soldiers will destroy the "treasure of Oriental culture" in the same way that cannon destroyed the Oriental Library? If that were the case, then running to the East Legation Quarter, living in a high place, what can they do to me? In fact, when Peiping is also incorporated into the territory of a puppet state, isn't there a way to get promoted and become wealthy? So Peiping university students are really too unable to see the big picture and too useless.</p>
<p>However, Peiping university students are not completely useless. For example, the "May Fourth" Movement and the "March 18th" Massacre are all glorious historical records. It's just that "teaching children to become lepers, one generation is not as good as the next."</p>
<p>As for the "school authorities" being rebuked as "also inappropriate," it is even more deserved. Who told them to "have not reported so far"? Isn't this close to condoning? If they had submitted a report in accordance with the regulations afterward, wouldn't the procedures be complete and without any responsibility? Could it be that after demanding salary and striking, they didn't even have time to write a report? So well deserved, well deserved, a third well deserved.</p>
<p>However, now is not the time to "bury oneself in books" or "follow the old ways." What is needed now is to recognize the great enemy in front of us, to sacrifice for the future of the nation. In particular, enlightened university students should join the vast ranks to sweep away the obstacles to national revolution and seize a bright future. So, it is not such a big deal that students temporarily abandon their studies for the sake of fighting for the nation.</p>

<h3>On the 25th of January, I Visited Elder Hefei at the World Culture Society in Shanghai and Had a Very Pleasant Conversation. On My Way Back to the Inn, I Hastily Composed Ten Seven-Character Quatrains</h3>
<p>— Rong Yin, He Shouren</p>
<p>····················</p>
<p>Hearing that your banners and flags have arrived at the coast, your dragon-horse spirit is still visible. Playing chess and worshiping Buddha can entertain the elderly, why bother asking directions to Ling Mountain? (It is said that he will go to Putuo, so I said this)</p>
<p>···················</p>
<p>Tianjin and Peiping are only a short distance away, but we have been separated for a long time (separated for more than a year). Today, I look up to you on a journey. I am glad that the elder is full of great expectations. Don't say that old age has failed your heroic plan.</p>
<p>··················</p>
<p>The times are difficult and the days are pressing, and my worries are deep. The old age still holds a heart to serve the country. It is difficult to make a move on a game of chess. The empty teaching of Li is about to form a forest.</p>
<p>······················</p>
<p>Also knowing that the times create heroes, I am still ashamed that the construction has not been completed. Drinking water and thinking of the source, I admire Li Wenzhong all my life. (The public has a five-ancient poem of ninety rhymes by Liang Wenzhong. During the summer of the previous year, I showed it to him, and every word was factual enough to be a portrayal of Wenzhong.)</p>
<p>······················</p>
<p>Time is like a movie passing by quickly. The book records that revisiting makes one feel a lot of loss. How many buildings have become rubble (referring to Zhabei)? I cannot bear to look back at the old rivers and mountains (referring to the three northeastern provinces).</p>

<h3>Tung Oil Prosperity</h3>
<p>— Zhanneng</p>
<p>"Tung oil" is a very important coating, very suitable for decorating houses. Applying it to wooden or ironware can prevent wood from rotting and iron from rusting. It can also be used as a raw material for white porcelain glaze, floor oil, and various other daily necessities. Therefore, I think it is of great research value. I will now briefly describe its properties, manufacturing, uses, and inspection methods below.</p>
<p>(1) Properties | The film formed by raw tung oil lacks elasticity and is uneven. Therefore, only cooked tung oil that has been boiled can be used. The characteristic of tung oil is that it can solidify at 500 degrees Fahrenheit or higher and is insoluble in thinners. However, if mixed with other types of oil, its solidification point will often decrease.</p>
<p>(2) Manufacturing | There are many methods for manufacturing tung oil. I will now introduce the methods used in China, the United States, and Germany below.</p>
<p>(A) Chinese manufacturing method ·· Add two qian each of litharge and massicot to ten jin of tung oil, put it in a pot and boil it, stirring constantly with a wooden stick. When it has boiled four or five times, pour it into an earthenware bowl and stir it constantly until it has cooled completely. (The heat should be moderate, neither too strong nor too weak, to prevent the tung oil from becoming too old or too raw. The added litharge and massicot are only for easy drying and gloss, and have no other effect.)</p>
<p>(B) American manufacturing method ·· Take ten gallons of tung oil and place it in a copper pot, heat it slowly to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, then add ten pounds of lead-manganese soap. After it has completely dissolved, add five gallons of pure linseed oil, stirring constantly. When the temperature reaches 400 degrees Fahrenheit, maintain it for half an hour, then remove from the heat and add two to three gallons of thinner to obtain the desired product.</p>
<p>(C) German manufacturing method; Heat the oil to 216 degrees Celsius, maintain it for one hour, stirring constantly, without stopping. After removing from the heat, it can be thinned with turpentine.</p>
<p>(3) Uses | Tung oil has a wide range of uses, which are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(A) Porcelain glaze: Grind tung oil, rosin, artificial varnish, and translucent porcelain together to obtain a white porcelain glaze, suitable for decorating houses. If the oil is heavy and the resin is light, it can be applied to woodenware.</p>
<p>(B) Protective film oil ·· A mixed oil made of a small amount of tung oil and a large amount of stearin is called protective film oil. When applied to three-in-one soil, it can fill the micro-gaps. At the same time, the tung oil in it will vaporize to form a solid protective film to protect the three-in-one soil so that it will not have chips flying after being trampled.</p>
<p>(C) Waterproof oil: Tung oil and glue can be used to make waterproof oil. When applied to machinery and pipe joints in water, it can prevent water erosion.</p>
<p>(D) Wall paint: Made from tung oil and rosin, when applied to walls, it can be washed with water or exposed to rain.</p>
<p>(E) Floor oil: Mix a little stearin into tung oil to make floor oil. It leaves no marks when stepped on and does not come off when washed with water. It is most suitable for use in trains and ships.</p>
<p>(F) Brushing oil: Also known as baking oil, it is used for painting car canopies and heaters. It can last for a long time. It is made by boiling tung oil, soybean oil, and a small amount of stearin to 520 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>(4) Inspection | To inspect the superiority of tung oil, if it is heated to 540 degrees, the pure oil will solidify into a light-colored solid. When cut with a knife, it will not be sticky. If the color of the oil is darker and sticky, it is evidence of adulteration.</p>
<h3>Yangchun Noodles</h3>
<p>— Qileng</p>
<p>Because I always wake up late every day and don't have time to eat breakfast, I always eat Yangchun noodles.</p>
<p>It was a Friday afternoon, and Lao Chen sat in the dormitory listlessly, as if he had something on his mind.</p>
<p>"Lao Chen! Why are you so unhappy today?" Lao Zhang asked him.</p>
<p>"I've run out of money for this week. I have two hao left for the fare home. I'm worried that I'll have to starve tomorrow morning," Lao Chen said with a sad face, at a loss.</p>
<p>"Fool! Are you afraid of not having money to eat Yangchun noodles? The living must find a way to live," Lao Zhang said with a mischievous look.</p>
<p>"Do you have a good idea? Please tell me, I'm willing to follow your good advice."</p>
<p>"To be honest, if you act according to the law, you won't have to worry about not having food," Lao Zhang said as if he had a plan in mind. Originally, Lao Zhang had the nickname Zhu Zhishan, and now I don't know what trick he has come up with again.</p>
<p>"Stop beating around the bush," Lao Chen urged.</p>
<p>So Lao Zhang whispered a few words into Lao Chen's ear.</p>
<p>"Wonderful plan! Wonderful plan!" Lao Chen jumped up happily.</p>
<p>···················</p>
<p>After dinner, Lao Fan knocked on his bowl and came into the room.</p>
<p>"Hey! Lao Fan! Miss Li sent a letter, do you want it?" Lao Chen opened the conversation first.</p>
<p>"Where is it?"</p>
<p>"It's here," Lao Zhang opened the drawer and took out a very large envelope.</p>
<p>"But I can give it to you, but you have to agree to conditions," Lao Chen winked at Lao Zhang.</p>
<p>"Lao Chen! You want to rip me off? That won't work, I'd rather not have the letter," Lao Fan had already seen through their tricks and pretended to be calm.</p>
<p>"It's an express letter, Lao Fan! Look at all the stamps on it. And it's so thick, maybe there's a handkerchief or a photo inside," Lao Zhang shook the letter in his hand a few times.</p>
<p>"Oh! Today is Friday, maybe she's asking you to see a movie tomorrow. I think you should agree to our conditions immediately; can an express letter be delayed for even a minute? My conditions are also very cheap, two bowls of Yangchun noodles, only 240 wen will do," Lao Chen said seriously.</p>
<p>"Okay, I agree to your conditions, you can give me the letter," Lao Fan finally fell into their trap.</p>
<p>"Wait, you must know that fair trade, old and young alike, is not deceived, and all relatives and friends are not in debt," Lao Zhang said a lot.</p>
<p>Lao Fan gave in and first gave them twenty-four copper coins, and then they gave him the letter.</p>
<p>"No, you've already stolen the letter paper," a minute later, Lao Fan opened the letter and saw that it was a ball of waste paper inside, and shouted.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you," Lao Chen said ·· "Originally, we didn't have money to eat Yangchun noodles tomorrow morning. This is the wonderful method that Lao Zhang came up with. He stole the envelope from Miss Li's previous letter, stuffed a ball of waste paper inside, sealed it, and pretended to come and deceive you. Please look at the date on it."</p>
<p>"Haha!" Zhang Zhang couldn't help laughing.</p>
<p>Lao Fan, seeing that he had fallen for their trick, was so angry that he didn't say a word.</p>
<h3>To Love Is to Love the Country</h3>
<p>— Xiaoheng</p>
<p>The Minimum Standard of Patriotism</p>
<p>Isn't patriotism the most fashionable slogan in society today? Aren't patriotic men the people that everyone admires and respects today?</p>
<p>It's a bit shameful to say! I've been mixing in society for half my life, maybe more than half my life. I often ask myself: Have I ever done one or two patriotic things? But my conscience's answer is a very simple two words: None. But I have also reflected on myself, can all my past behaviors be considered unpatriotic? My self-confidence also resolutely answers me with two words: No.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, my opinion needs to be explained in detail. Because I have not done any patriotic undertakings, of course I cannot be considered patriotic. This is a very obvious principle, and there is no need to talk about it. As for the reason why I dare to be confident that I am not unpatriotic, it is because in</p>
