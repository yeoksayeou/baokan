<p>日軍後退之意義及其企圖</p>
<p>日本軍隊借口其所謂安全。發動熱河軍事以來。節節進逼。旣襲奪我山海關要隘。又侵奪我熱河五十八萬方里之地面。沿長城各口隘。除喜峯口因宋哲元所部一戰之力。尚能勉强保持外。其餘各地。如距北平不過二百餘里之古北口。亦淪敵手。我方乃退守南天門。由冷口迄山海關。原稱天險。然皆不耐立體戰爭。致爲敵方所奪取。甚至灤東五縣。相繼淪没或爲日軍所侵。或爲僞軍所據。官方電傳爲戰略關係。退至灤河西岸。再行沿河掘壕設險。準備與敵軍作長久支持。不意日軍近忽向後撤退。彼國軍事當局。雖曾發出似是而非之聲明。申述其退兵之理由。謂其退出地域爲（中立地帶）。然日本軍閥。素無信義。且根本不顧信義。其聲明之絶不足憑信。徴諸往事。至屬顯然則日本軍國主義之撤退灤東日軍。與侵入長城以南各部隊。果何故歟。</p>
<p>第一。日軍此次進犯。所以到處通行者。緣我方熱河駐軍未嘗抵抗。且不作整個作戰計畫。全綫動員之軍事行動也。况日軍西侵部隊。僅弘前第八師團全部。（該師團附有盛岡之騎兵第三旅團）熊本第六師團全部。旭川第七師團所屬第十四混成旅團。騎兵第四旅團。再加兩個南滿路守備大隊。一個華北守備隊。合計人數不過五萬。而火線自灤河口以至於古北口。綿亘一千七八百里。如我國作困獸之鬥與之一拚者。則彼逐處皆露弱點。到處皆有被擊破之虞。是故爲保全其旣得勝利之頂點計。爲便於進攻計。皆以縮短戰線爲得策。同時彼又預料日軍如果撤退則華軍將不至跟踪追擊。彼收進退自如之效。我受往來奔馳之勞。果也北平軍事當局。發命前線軍隊。不許窮追。此日軍鑑於一般形勢。而撤退侵入灤東軍隊之第一理由也。</p>
<p>第二。華盛頓爐邊談話。雖尚未正式公布其結果。而英國首相與美總統之間。已成立相對諒解。此縱非永久的。至少在世界經濟恐慌未平服之前。英美兩國必將協同步調。以開拓貿易市場及投資塲所。其具體决定。固有待於世界經濟會議。惟英美諒解。旣趨接近。羅麥之共同宣言。又曾提及（白銀）問題。其欲謀東方市塲之安定。已躍然紙上。用銀國家。吾國可謂爲當世界第一。印度雖擁有一百八十萬０五千方哩地域。三億一千餘萬之人口。但屬於英帝國經濟聯盟同一範疇之内。勿許外人揷足。則足供世界經濟轉圜者。惟我中華民國一國。然自九一八事變迄於今日。東北四省皆處日軍鐵蹄之下。我國國民經濟。本身且無喘息之餘地。何有餘力以吸收外貨。長此以往。我國人求生無路。且必亟起救死。日本爲中國民族當前之大敵。鬭爭時期。必甚長久。而資本主義各國於此。必蒙受嚴得不利之影響。是以英美兩國。一則爲維持遠東旣得利益。一則爲開拓未來市塲。不能不尋求兩國間暫時之諒解。以圖遠東之安定。換言之。即對日將有所舉動。（此種舉動或將以經濟爲限）蓋以目下情勢論。開灤煤礦及北寗鐵路。已不免受日本之脅制。設使日軍再行進攻。在國際上必惹出更大困難。現在中東路糾紛。正在擴大。日印商務又生阻力。再加以英日如爲華北利益而發生爭執者。則日本愈陷於孤立。經濟上困難。必更甚於今日。是故日本爲顧全其自身利益。爲减少外交上之障礙。乃不能不暫時退却。此其所以撤退侵科灤東日軍之第二理由也。</p>
<p>况日軍此次侵熱兵力。綜上所述。在古北口。豐寗承德等地。僅第八師團。人數不過二萬。喜峯口一帶爲第十四混成旅團及騎兵第四旅團之一部。灤東各縣。由山海關迄冷口城子嶺口等地。西北至於凌源。爲第六師團及三個守備大隊。雜以僞國雜軍。其兵力薄弱。已可槪見。徒以我國不肯用全力抗爭。致長敵人驕氣。益增其侵略野心耳。然彼亦自知未可再行輕進。尤其是國際關係。不能不有所顧慮。故暫時自灤東撤退。以惰我國之敵愾。以緩和國際間之空氣。但日人詭計多端。若從另一方面。集中兵力。扼制我古北口。更進而窺伺我多倫張北。則我又將何如耶。</p>

<p>理一年有奇、張學良未走之前、派天津市長周龍光奉前北平軍委分會命、代表軍委分會、於二月八日與法人簽立協定、並非出賣、亦未得欵、該海軍醫院坐落法租界昆連處、面積凡三十九畝、法人年來再三交涉、擬從中闢馬路一道、計算須佔地七畝、據醫院院長張子翔談稱、該醫院附設學校、自十六年以後、只收到三千元之經費、所欠法國敎授醫師等欵、纍計已達九萬元、又當前清庚子後、法國商船一隻、赴我大沽口、欲入我船廠修理、未進廠、即被焚燒、按理我國本不應賠償、惟因該法人頗能左右現在之法國領事、故要求如解决海軍醫院案、須連帶賠償彼捐失六萬元、此條應當拒絶、而此次協定竟允許之、協定業已簽字、内容大略以馬路佔地七畝、不能作價、而該處地每畝價值二萬元、我國即有十四萬之損失、法敎授醫師等薪金九萬元、折合須賠地四畝餘、法商船價六萬、亦須折賠地三畝（均以每畝兩萬元折價）協定現在雖尚未執行、地皮仍由中國管理、但協定旣已簽字、實行只北是時間問題、此事就責任言、張學良爲平軍委分會代委員長、無權代表政府處分國家公有財產、且醫院及學校敎授及醫師不僅法國人、中國人亦甚多、若由地價發欠薪、中國人亦應分潤、而竟未提及、法國被焚之船不應賠償而賠償之、均屬喪失利權、監察院對此早已提出彈劾、惟因當時尚未明瞭詳細情形、至現在雖已調查明白、但該地與法租界毘連、辦理殊感不易云、</p>

<p>因爲不能戰所以抵抗</p>
<p>因爲不能和所以交涉</p>
<p>是以抵抗與交涉並行</p>
<p>上海市政府、昨接南京來電、行政院長汪精衛關於中日和戰問題、有極詳細之解釋、兹覓錄原電如下、近來有人對於政府應付國難的態度、發生疑問、以爲不和則戰、不戰則和、如此不和不戰、是無辦法、我對於此點、認爲有簡單說明之必要、我的說明很簡單、因爲不能戰所以抵抗、因爲不能和所以交涉、政府應付國難的態度、不是不和不戰、而是抵抗與交涉並行、如今先說爲甚麽因爲不能戰所以抵抗、中國今日有具備與日本宣戰的條件麽、稍有常識的人、都能加以否認、無待多說、但是宣戰與抵抗不同、宣戰要量力而爲、抵抗則不必量力而爲漍於敵人來侵犯時、物質上盡其所有、精神上盡其所能、</p>
<h3 id="c135">以爲抵禦 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>不但不必量力、而且不當量力、中國今日誠然是弱、每月傾其所入十分之九以上、用於軍費、而前線兵士、依然糧運不繼、子彈不充、其他一切應有的軍事設備、更不必說、窮與弱是無可諱言了、但誠想將來亡國以後、便怎樣呢、只怕現時所有的幾枝槍·幾門砲、也歸於烏有、難道到那時候便不想恢復麽、没有槍便拿竹桿、没有砲便拿石頭、也要拼着性命去謀恢復、然則眼前還有幾枝槍幾門砲、也京勝於亡國以後多了、難道現時代想抵抗、直到亡國以後才想恢復嗎、以上是抵抗的</p>
<h3 id="c136">眞正意義 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>明白了這意義、我們便須有以下兩樣辦法、其一我們咬定牙齒不要呌苦、政府不要因爲籌餉不遂、呼援不應而呌苦、人民不要因爲傾家蕩產顚沛流離而呌苦、兵士不要因爲饑塞無告接濟不周而呌苦、因爲中國是苦命的中國、中國人是苦命的中國人、苦命是注定了的、我們安排吃苦、不要隨便呌苦、其二、我們旣有咬定牙齒來苦的决心、則我們必須時時的心裏想着、手裏做着、却切切不可口裏喊着幼稚的愛國思想、愛國惟恐人不知、成熟的</p>
<p>愛國思想、愛國惟恐人知、因爲在這</p>
<h3 id="c137">强權世界 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>一個窮而弱的國家、口口聲聲說愛國、便有亡國的危險、所以不愛國則已、愛國的第一義、便有沉默、貼標語喊口號的時代、已過去了、斷斷乎再用不着了、以小敗爲大嚷、以大敗爲小勝、以失守爲戰略的放棄、以退却爲變更陣地、這種戰事新聞、不但爲敵人所笑、而且助長了國民虚惰的愛國心、這種虚惰的愛國心、使國民容易因存過分的奢望而激動　又因受過分的失望而沮喪、這尤其是斷斷乎要不得的、我們越沉默越堅决、越悲哀越勇壯、口裏越說得少、心裏越想得多、手裏也越做得多、這是苦命的國民、安排吃苦的最要辦法、我們的前途是勝利的、但是勝利的前途、是遼遠的、我們眼前、或者還要經過</p>
<h3 id="c138">許多失敗 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>不抵抗固然要失地、抵抗依然也會失地、但是抵抗而失地、總比較不抵抗而失地、是强得多、我們只要問抵抗的盡力與不盡力、我們不要問抵抗的有無效果、因爲眼前的失敗、便是將來勝利之母、以上是說明因爲不能戰所以抵抗的理由、如今再說爲什麽因爲不能和所以交涉、須知今日所謂和、不過屈辱之别名罷了、（忍辱圖存）古人原有這麽一句話、但是今日是忍辱圖存呢、還是</p>
<h3 id="c139">忍辱圖亡 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>如今已經有人說、與其將士地一塊一塊的失去、不知（毒蛇螫手、壯士斷腕、）古人也有這麽一句話、但是究竟斷腕呢、還是斷首、如果僅是斷腕、可以說是圖存、如果是斷首、乃祗是圖亡、我們不但要有（寗死不辱）的志氣、而且知道均之死也、與其辱而死、不如不辱而死、如今要問、假若我們簽名於承認傀儡政府、割讓東三省熱河之條約、這是斷腕呢、還是斷首、或者有人以爲這是斷腕、例如近日公然有人在天津通電說、要爲河北人民留</p>
<h3 id="c140">一線生路 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>這是便是斷腕的論調、但我以爲這不是斷腕、只是斷首、這原是不煩言而解的、不但蠶食之人、貪得無厭、不以斷腕而已足、而且此端一開、這個來也斷腕、那個來自然也不能不斷腕、其結果不至肢解不止、然則不但斷首、而且凌遲了、然則亦謂和、不但是屈辱的别名、而且是死亡的别名了、我們不但要有寗死不辱的志氣、並且知道、均之死也、與其辱而死、不如不辱而死、然則還說交涉做什麽呢、我以爲有好些人、對於交涉、有時過於奢望、有時又過於失望、我常常聽見人說、中國要入歐戰時比利時、試問中國拿什麽比比利時呢、比利時對</p>
<h3 id="c141">德國抗戰 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>的時候、俄國法國已與德國開戰了、英國跟着也與德國開戰了、日本今日在國際、固然失了這德上的同情、而軍事經濟、猶足以無道行之、中國在國際、固然得了道德上的同情、而又窮又弱、絶未得有援助、以孤立之中國、支孤立之日本、而乃欲自比於比利時、這是何等過分的奢望呢、然而一反過來、就蔑視了國際道德上的同情以爲没得一些價值、則其過分的失望、往往與前者一樣、須知道國際聯盟之締給、各會員國、相約彼此尊重其主權之獨立、與領土之完整、並相約以種種和平手段替代戰爭、這於世界之和平、實有不少的關係、從前如俄普奥三國、瓜分波蘭的、</p>
<h3 id="c142">野蠻手段 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>於今日不能再用了、其有違犯盟約者、雖然格於情勢、一時不能施以經濟上或軍事上的制裁、而由道德上之制裁、已宣布其爲犯天下之大不韙者了、這一方固然是各會員國主張公道的結束、一方也不能不說是九一八以來、我國不屈不撓的結果、所以過分的失望、是無理由的、至於對於日本目前固無交涉之可言、但將來終有交涉之一日的、其方式如何、或是日本終於回到國聯從其决議、或是日本毅然放棄其向來的侵略政策、而自動的進於中日共存之路、或是尚有其他方式、無論其方式如何、我們所能說的、也只有從</p>
<h3 id="c143">國家人格 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>設想、以確立最低限度、在最低限度以内、我們不惜委曲求全、超乎最低限度、我們只有寗死不辱、這是交涉之根本的意義、總而言之、如果有害於中國之國家人格、不但不爲日本一國所屈服、便是各國聯合起來强迫中國、也不爲所屈、我所謂交涉與抵抗並行者、大致如此、這是一句老話、我從前說過已不少次了、然而今日所說、也只有這一句老話、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>誰道上帝板板，上帝再要通融也没有，爲着中華民國在横裏吃了許多虧，便把豎裏來補報。横裏去了豎裏來，這是一般有骨董癖的大好老，值得破涕爲笑的。</p>
<p>横裏怎樣的吃虧？唉！說也痛心，中華民國的地形，向稱似一瓣私海棠葉；現在呢，變了一瓣春蠶吃過的桑葉了，眼睜睜地看好惡魔把東北的地圖剪去了三大塊，正北的地圖剪去了一大塊，横裏的地方縮去了許多，正不知要縮到怎麽樣才休？骨董癖的大好老說：不要慌，不要忙，横裏去了豎裏來，有了周代禮器，又有漢代石像，又有玉版製自唐明皇</p>
<p>，又有實劍出於袁天罡：這許多價值　城的寳物，都是一直從地下掘起的，失去了横裏的疆界，得到了豎裏的庫藏。</p>
<p>滕縣發現的周代銅器，完整的十四件，都是無價之寳。又發現漢代石室，滿壁都是畫像。山東的某地，又掘得唐明皇祭神所用的玉版，文字完全。彰德西北鄕東灰營村，今春發現趙簡王墓，内有綠水一溪傳播遠近；又從墓側發現唐代名人袁天罡墳墓。中央研究院派員赴該地調查攝影，墓的四周，有黄金器物，墓頂懸有寳劍一，金劍一，黄金道冠一，並有金飾值十餘萬元。絡繹不絶的發現寳物，現各報上大書特書，倘把考古的眼光來觀察中國，儘可忘却失地的慘痛，而充滿着掘土得寳的無量歡喜。</p>
<p>假使滕縣所得的鼎，盤，敦，鬲，可以充做防空嚴械；唐明皇的玉版，可以抵禦唐克車；戴了袁天罡的黄金道冠，仗着袁天罡的寳劍金劍，可以比着宋哲元的大刀隊有一百倍效力；那麽，有了竪裏的得寳，便不怕横裏的失地了。可惜！只博得少數骨董的欣賞，而不能解釋全國人民的憂懼。唉！</p>

<p>動植物，就是不受意外的侵襲，到了年老血衰，或是細胞組織衰退時，總免不了一口氣不來壽終正寢，或是枝殘幹萎，朽腐消滅。人是忝爲動物之一，當然也避不開二腿一挺的那條路。外國有移接青春腺的一種勾當，那也不過同大慈善家的修橋補路，造廟燒香，一樣的得到延年益壽之功而已究竟也不能做到長生不老。中國的深山大澤之中，很有些飛簷走壁的老道士，怪和尚，專講燒丹煉汞之方，採陰補陽之道，說可以長生不老，換骨脫股。但是待到了相當時期，仍不免於嗚呼哀哉，伏維尚饗。可知壽長壽短，容或有之，不老長生，萬無此事。</p>
<p>不料素以科學發達自詡的日本，據二十一日東京朝日新聞說，竟也迷信起不死之說，根據着哄騙秦始皇的那個大騙子帶到日本的古文獻數百册，經苦心研究之結果，居然發明了不老長生的靈藥。這靈藥是滿含奇異芳香的藥酒，已引起社會各方面的注意。我想大抵總已已有許多怕死朋友試騐過，而且隔日飮了這種酒，一定是没有一個明天不下床，所以報上都許爲靈藥，而且這消息已傳到了中國。從此中國人將視燒丹煉汞，採陰補陽爲迂腐。若是秦始皇早得此藥，或可把長城沿長到阿拉伯，而現在還在幹焚書坑儒的勾當。</p>
<p>但，不知飮了這種酒，是否有大刀砍不進的功效。若是有的，那我們中國糟糕了。若是每一個日本人都服用此酒，只生不死，人口過剩，拚命望大陸發展，那我們中國更糟透了頂。</p>

<p>— 八邵振之</p>
<p>三月二十八，洪山吃甘蔗一，這是武漢民間的一句俗語，我也無暇去翻年鑑考察它的歷史，我曾問過一個和尚，他說：（三月二十八就是洪山塔成立的紀念）。</p>
<p>這天，就說今年的這一天吧，因天道很好，不陰霾又無烈日，更加之禮拜六的來臨，所以，洪山的半邊，都給游人占駐了。</p>
<p>今天過江輪之特别增加，江漢關計五艘，王家巷計四艘，我們給它一個總計，過江的將近二萬人，輪渡資差不多上千元，其中有一大大半是到洪山。這是漢口一方面。</p>
<p>自武昌路到洪山約十里之遙，這條路在現在已成爲（山陰道上），自早晨黄昏都不曾間斷過人。</p>
<p>有閑的人們，在今日，不特占據了洪山，而且，鄂垣的全國足運，漢口的中山公園，華商跑馬場等；都是人山人海，在這里，覺得人們的心目中是没有（國難）。</p>
<p>洪山除去了一座寳塔，就没有什麽古蹟可以賞鑑；田梓琴的墳墓；向有稍微兒建築的價值；寳通寺：不過是一個方式的古刹而已，等着吧！黎菩薩同他夫人的軀壳不是怕東洋人搬到日本去陳列而自運到了湖北嗎？他現在就安居在洪山，雖然，北平的存亡，早在我們預料之中？湖北原是安樂土，黎菩薩（生）（死）可都有福氣，他現在湖北，想來湖北是不會失的：我們且看其偉大墳墓的建築吧！</p>
<p>但是（三月二十八，洪山吃甘庶），這個（甘蔗）的典故，我不知道｜大多數都不知道；我所知道的洪山的甘庶今天是特别的多，而每個來者的人都要吃它一吃，這是確實的。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>自我華受了歐風美雨的洗禮，頓時把禮敎的束縛，男女的大防，整個的打破了，自由解放，社交公開，陌生生的男和女，在電影院或跳舞塲，一見傾心，便接吻握手，海誓山盟，結爲夫婦同居之好，那是最便捷没有的了。但是隔不多時，因爲細事相忤，片言不合，雙方請了律師，登報宣告離婚，也是便捷異常。所以你若然翻翻報紙，没有一天不是連篇累牘的刋載着離婚的案件。</p>
<p>離婚的風氣一開，連得我們文藝同道中人，也感受到離鸞别鵠的慘痛。第一個就是徐枕亞，他听雜憶三十首註中：（余與蕊珠兩次離婚，辛酉秋間，經親友調解，仍許歸侍，：：：遂爲末次之離婚，惟因手續仍未完備，家人不能即爲余别娶，：：：）觀此，可知他們的伉儷，感情是很篤的，這個離婚，是出於被動罷了，還有個是已故的畢倚虹，結褵</p>
<p>了十有七年，生了許多子女，他的夫人忽然和他離婚，倚虹傷痛之餘，撰了篇（離婚後的子女），寄給鄙人，刋登在星光雜誌上，寫的很是沈痛呢，最近如江小鶼的和他夫人離婚，一時報紙喧騰，毁譽參半，幾乎把他的一件事，當作離婚史上的重要史料哩。</p>
<p>無意中翻着一本木凟小志，載有薛鑄聽斷離婚事，雖然是過去的舊聞，但是却很幽默，不妨把牠轉錄出來，給摩登人士們瞧瞧：（薛鑄，木凟鎭老人。坐申明亭，聽斷一離婚事。鑄叱其婦翁曰：何故議離？云壻流落貧甚不堪也。鑄曰：若旣欲離，罰出十金。翁欣然取十金來曰：求一休婚書，鑄曰：且未！即令人至家，更取十金，共付壻曰；速擇日成親！翁頓足曰；曷爲罰吾金而復婚之？鑄曰：汝嫌其貧耳，今有二十金，可成禮爲生業。婦翁語塞，壻叩謝去。）這種妙判，很願現代法官審理離婚案件來取法牠。</p>

<p>送了一壺開水，一大包雜拌來，還問題：楊老太，您有茶葉没有，若是没有，我就去那來。江氏道：多謝老太爺想的週到，茶葉我們這裏已經有了。小林聽說没事，這才去了。江氏因向桂枝道：老太爺這種人多好，要他來做你的上人，你還有什麽不願意的嗎？桂枝紅了臉道，這是什麽話？他怎麽會成了我的上人呢？江氏笑道：你别着急，我這話没有說出，你若是拜他做乾爺，他不就是你的上人嗎？桂枝淡淡的道：人家不願意，您老說着，也不嫌貧嗎？他也就只說了這樣一句，不向下談了。（五六）</p>

<p>五月音樂會</p>
<p>今年的五月份，可以算是一個（音樂月），音樂會，將次第舉行。</p>
<p>（一）勃拉姆斯百斫誕辰樂會</p>
<p>（二）星期交響樂會</p>
<p>（三）中國古樂舞蹈會</p>
<p>（四）華格那五十年祭樂會</p>
<p>（五）應尚能獨唱樂會</p>
<p>勃拉姆斯百年誕辰樂會，由工部局管弦樂隊奏演，指揮者爲梅百器，中間有俄國鋼琴名手莫意賽維契的獨奏，時期在於五月七日之夜，地點在光明戲院。</p>
<p>勃拉姆斯Ｂｒａｈｍｓ是十九世紀德國的優秀作曲家。生於一八三三年，卒於一八九七年。他創作過二百多首的歌謠獨唱曲，是歌謠作曲家中的一大巨匠。他是一個反動的古典派音樂家，作風一方汲取貝多芬的靈感，使他成爲純粹樂派中的一大權威，另一方面，在浪漫作風中染有古典的傾向，這便表現出了勃拉姆斯的特殊的作風。</p>
<p>莫意賽維契Ｂｅｎｎｏ　Ｍｏｉｓｅｉｗｉｔｓｃｈ生於俄羅斯的奥物沙城，從小便住在倫敦，五歲卽學鋼琴，九歲得音樂奬學金，十四歲在維也納從名敎師雷奢帝支基爲師，十五歲得盛名，現在是成了世界有名的鋼琴家了。</p>
<p>中國古樂舞蹈會，定於五月二十一日夜在大光明表演，主僱者爲佛麗姿夫人，聞已聘梅蘭芳爲指導。</p>
<p>華格那五十年祭樂會，在梅百器指導之下，將於五月二十八日仍假府大光明公開演奏，</p>
<p>華格那Ｗａｇｎｅｒ是世界樂壇上的一大天才，有（歌劇之王）的榮銜。生於一八一三年，卒於一八八三年。他的代表名作，有歌劇（龍恩格林），（巴西華爾），（漂泊葡蘭人），（名歌手），（德里斯丹（與意索爾特），（湯霍賽爾），（黎恩錫），（意瑪爾），（尼貝龍根的指環）等等。這一夜，聞已聘名歌家八人，選唱華格那的傑</p>
<p>作，對於這一個去世五十週年的德國音樂家，聊誌哀思。</p>
<p>應尚能獨唱會，將於五月十日晚九時一刻，在美國婦女俱樂部演奏。並有戴粹倫的提琴獨奏參加，鋼琴伴奏者爲李獻敏小姐。</p>
<p>應尚能先生，是國立音樂院的聲樂敎授。節目已預定，其中有勃拉姆斯，馬斯南，韓德爾，克萊斯雷等的作品，並有應尚能自製的（寄所思），及趙元任的（也是微雲），（小詩），（聽雨）等曲。</p>
<p>在跳舞塲或影戲院聽慣墳着薩克斯風Ｓａｘｏｐｈｏｎｅ和爵士Ｊａｚｚ音樂的上海士女，或者對於那些新興音樂中所表現的快速步調感到過度的剌戟。那不妨回頭過來欣賞這些將成爲歷史上陳跡的音樂會，在這保存着十八九世紀時代精神的夜樂會中，至少，可以喚醒我們的音樂舊夢；又可使我們回嚼看古典派典雅意味，和浪漫派的優美情調。</p>
<p>在我私人，對於西洋的音樂，雖保存有懷舊</p>
<p>的情調，但是對於中國的古樂，却從没有方法可以感到興味。兩週前，在世界學院會見波蘭現代作曲家湯斯孟的一夜，我傾聽大同樂會的古樂演奏，祇覺得所謂中國的古樂，只人旋律，皆缺乏和諧的和聲。凑着許多樂器的在一起，祗演奏出一種單純的旋律，完全是原始的樂風。聽慣了西洋管弦樂隊交響曲，對於中國音樂，實然是聽不習慣。不過，我對於大同樂會肯廢除沿用的中國工尺簡譜，改用近代音樂界通行的五線譜表，至少在一點上，我是非常表示滿意。</p>

<p>女校乙組愛國女中現得十九分、雄心勃勃、大有染指錦標希望、尊命天子關艷嬌小姐、一人連得跳遠與鉛球兩第一、共計十分、爲爲國之主力軍、務本在徑賽中聲勢頗大、現雖得十四分、較愛國少云五分、未嘗無冠軍希望、且看今日兩校之逐鹿、</p>
<p>女校甲組務本亦可穩取冠軍、現得十五分、培明其次、得十分、諒非務本之敵、</p>
<p>體校不分男女錦標、分數係混合計算、聊比優劣、東亞人才濟濟、共得五十七、江南全賴男子之力、亦得二十三分之多、其次東南女體師十三分、兩江女體師五分、中國女體師五分、</p>

<p>昨日男女徑賽决賽項目凡四、各項競爭、均甚劇烈、百米及千五百米、尤富興趣、略記如下、</p>
<p>▲百米　開塲第一次徑賽百米决賽、先由男甲組出塲、八人逐鹿、競爭至烈、形勢極爲平均、第一名光華董寅初以半步佔先、其餘幾成一線、疾馳而過、軒輊難分、經裁判員會商許久、始决定第二爲大夏中學李松年、第三民立劉嘉獻、第四復中程志宏、時間十二秒二、乙組亦頗平均、青年會中學汪湘生以一步戰勝、時間十三秒、男體組終點形勢激烈、第一第二爲江南楊芳與李延祥、時間十二秒三、</p>
<p>（一）男甲標槍第一滬工劉家瑀、（中）男甲千五百米第一清心計頌恩、（下）男乙千五百米第一光華劉崇禮、（王開與啟昌攝）</p>
<p>▲五十米　女甲開始决賽、務本人材濟濟、包辦前二名及第四名、衝剌工夫極佳、終點先後則頗明顯、預複成績最佳蕭傑英、卒獲冠軍、時間七秒八、女體組前三名爲東亞三老名將包辦、惟錢行素僅列位置耳、冠軍爲陳畹卿、時間七秒六、女乙組仍以務本勢力最大、計獲九分之多、</p>
<p>▲四百米　四百米决賽、甲組關老爺（長發）畢竟鰲頭獨佔、以五十六獲冠軍、乙組汪湘生第一、勝來　易、時間五十九秒、體校組江南李延祥得冠軍、功夫五十六秒四、後三名屬東亞　　▲千五百米　男甲競爭、至爲劇烈、自始至終、形勢緊張、長跑如此平均、不易多見、育青方德忠放一圈半、鷂子而卒落伍、浦東葉堪泉緊隨人後、曾一度領前、以爲可望錄取、詎不然者、大夏程志遠在最後尚餘三百米領前疾馳、以爲可獲冠軍、不料至最後三十米、被清心計頌恩超出、計以四分零六秒獲冠軍、程第二、第三第四爲吴子靜詹貽基、均落後不多、乙組光華之劉崇禮獨佔鰲頭、態度從容、毫不氣喘、體校組成績比較最佳、東亞得前二名、江南勝後兩名、</p>
<p>女甲跳高第一俞越先之姿勢（五開攝）</p>
<p>[P如是我記</p>
<p>王克永鐵面無私　糾察長王克永君、奔走會塲、熱心服務、見塲中無徽章之人、不論何人、一槪驅逐出塲、鐵面無私、不可多得、會塲秩序、得以整肅不紊、</p>
<p>大力士引人注目　昨建國中學表演力功、有大力士林壽章者、係南洋華僑、去秋始入建國、表演力敵十二人、其法手挽繩束、每端由六人猛拉、林君絲毫不動、其次表演胸膛碎石、林之頭脚支於兩凳上、腹空、上支大石三塊、由一人持鐵錘擊石、三擊連碎三石、觀者咋舌不止、</p>
<p>擲標槍槍折中止　昨標槍比賽、會中共備標槍四枝、不料賽至中途、四槍均斷、不得已比賽乃中止、另往購得重易、此實爲一部份運動員缺少訓練、不諳投擲之法耳、</p>
<p>名選手何榮之有　南方中學關長發、一致予爲田徑賽名將者、曾出席全國及遠東大會、而不知關近忽供讀於南方中學、東平庸之中學生比試、四百米以五十六秒得第一、何榮之有、</p>

<p>（三）朱先生說：（我來告訴你。前年當瀋陽事變後，海上的學生，大學生，中學生，小學生，男的，女的，他們充滿了滿腔的熱血，大聲疾呼的到鄕下去宣傳，滿希望喚起農民的愛國。</p>
<p>可是結果呢？不是等於零嗎？）朱先生馬上就跟着追問一句，一這是什麽緣故呢？對於這點我想你還未觀透，我來告訴你。劉先生！這就是農村敎育不發達的原故。）朱先生！謝謝你的好意！但是你知道前年上海各處對於瀋陽事變的宣傳運動的經過究竟是怎樣？假使你不是故意地閉着眼睛不看事實，故意地抹殺事實，你就不會這樣强詞奪理。當上海各處學生宣傳抗日的時候，鄕村農民與城市工人同樣地熱烈地表示愛國與反抗的情緒，但是爲政治環境所限制，那能見諸行動，這與農民有無知識與有無敎育有什麽關係呢？你的意思是說農民没有知識没受敎育所以不曉得（天下興亡，匹夫有責）之義，實在這是你們的空談。假定你們的（新式桃花源）幾十年或百數十年普遍於全中國，農民都像尤朱　先生一樣的有知識，有敎育這自然是幻想，）那中國的（萬刦不復，）更是做到十足！因爲你們這種有知識，有敎育的更會閉着眼睛不看事實，祇知避開現實。朱先生駡學生們到鄕村去做宣傳是（吃力不討好，）這句話的確駡得對：不但不討好，反而吃官司···（四）我前信第一條所提出種種問題，只逼出你今天這封信（中國農村敎育所以不發達，情形當然是複雜一的一句答語；再進一步，就是什麽（政治的不上軌道：：：等等）多元論的答復。但我要問你：（政治爲什麽不上軌道呢？軍閥爲什麽内訌呢？共匪爲什麽到　擾亂呢？苛捐雜稅爲什麽不能剷除呢？這些問題，我們屢次向你提出，你爲什麽不解答呢？我四月十二給尤先生的信上所提出的一些問題，如（一）條所舉你們又爲什麽不回答呢？其他各位讀者質問你的信，爲什麽不回答呢？避開正面的現實問題不答，那不是辦法。</p>

<h3 id="c262">電源變壓器製作法 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>變壓器是利用電磁感應性的原理造成的，變壓器之用途，乃用以變更電壓。電壓自低而高稱爲上級變壓器，反之則爲下級變壓器，變壓器至少有二個綫圈（亦祇有　個線圈者稱單捲變壓器）接於電源者，曰初級圈，供給電力於他器者曰次級圈，最近交流收音機通行，變壓器之用途日廣，本篇專論是項變壓器該器工率之大小以瓦特（Ｗａｔｔ）計算，即電流與電壓之乘積，電壓的單位是弗打，電流的單位是安培以算式表之如下工率＝電壓Ｘ電流</p>
<p>例如圖之一變壓器，有三個次級圈，則其工率爲各綫圈之輸出工率之和。</p>
<p>初級　２００弗打</p>
<p>次級（１）２·５弗打　３·５　安培</p>
<p>（２）５弗打　２　安培</p>
<p>（３）６００弗打　　·０２安培</p>
<p>次級圈（　）中間的接頭是中心線，二邊二個線圈，對於中心線，都有３００弗打，共是６００弗打電流是·０２５安培，這是預備用雙屏整流管的。</p>
<p>（１）２·５Ｘ３·５＝８·７５瓦特</p>
<p>（２）５Ｘ２＝１０瓦特</p>
<p>（３）６００Ｘ·０２５＝１５瓦特</p>
<p>共計　３３·７５瓦特</p>
<p>變壓器之工率旣已知道，在第一表中找出相當大的變壓器來，即可知全荷載效率，初級圈數，每弗打圈數，及鐵心斷面積。</p>
<p>如例一之變壓器其次級輸出爲　瓦特，在表中找出較此爲大者方能勝任，因變壓器有少許損失，如初級圈之耗阻損失，及磁流（Ｆｌｕｘ　Ｌｅａｋａｇｅ）損失，故初級之工率輸出，决不能等。</p>

<p>— 秉</p>
<p>直流電之收音機，換電池常覺麻煩與不經濟，倘能改爲交流則可一勞永逸·斯篇所述係一隻二燈機，所費甚微而効力不遜於直流電一燈機。如將原有之直流機改裝，則所費更屬無幾：且機内電源部份所用之變壓器，不必另行設計製造，祇需一有５Ｖ，２ＡＭＰ，之電鈴方棚代之，用以燃二只ＵＹ２２７之眞空管，（按此號管子燈絲電壓爲２·５Ｖ故須串聯連結），其他材料如係新創，宜購下列各件：</p>
<p>（一）三回路線圈　一只</p>
<p>（二）電鈴方棚（５Ｖ，２ＡＭＰ）　一只</p>
<p>（三）低週率扼制線圈（３０Ｈｅｎｒｙ）一只</p>
<p>（四）固定電容器（２ＭＦＰ）　一只</p>
<p>（五）聽筒（４０００Ｍ）　一副</p>
<p>（六）固定電容器（　００ＭＥＤ）　一只</p>
<p>（七）活動電容器（　０００ＭＦＤ）　一只</p>
<p>（八）棚漏器（２ＭＥＧ）　一只</p>
<p>固定電容器（０００２５ＭＥＧ）　一只</p>
<p>眞空管（ＵＹ２２７）　二只</p>
<p>ＵＹ燈座　二只</p>
<p>其他如木板，接線鈕，電線，刻度盤，各若干</p>
<p>以上各件配齊後用線照圖銲接·完畢，再檢查有無錯誤，即可接上電流（二百二十伏打或一百十均可但所備電鈴方棚須合所用之電流）一二分鐘後待燈絲熱透，調節再生圈及活動電容器，即可收音矣。此機收本埠可不用天地線然用天地線則可收日本及南京等播音如覺選擇性不佳，則僅用天線或地線。</p>
<p>編者按：此機代乙電電源直接取自電燈線。故機甲各件不可觸及地線以防危險。在地線與接地柱間，揷入一能耐電壓較高之電容器，則比較穩妥。</p>

<p>— 體乾</p>
<p>（一）須先熟記電碼之組織，點劃，空隙，然後學按　鑰（Ｋｅｙ）</p>
<p>（二）按鑰之正當方式，以右手食中兩指尖，與鑰柄相接觸，不宜用力過猛，但亦不可太輕，過猛則點劃糢糊，太輕則容易失落點子，又不可指與鑰柄脫離，宜以大指輕輕夾持。</p>
<p>（三）食中兩指尖，與鑰柄接觸處，宜輕鬆自然，忌矜持過甚，輕鬆自然則靈便，矜持過甚則笨拙，靈便則敏捷，笨拙則遲鈍。</p>
<p>（四）按鑰時，手腕宜懸空，手臂彎成九十度式，初試雖頗覺困難，但總之旣久，則繼續拍發電文至數萬字之多，亦不覺疲勞也。</p>
<p>（五）拍發電文時，指尖祇須向下用力，大指用處，僅在扶持，非爲推引鑰柄向上之用。</p>
<p>（六）初學按鑰者，祇求穩定無誤，勿存求速之心，求速而不穩定，必致慌張錯亂，改正又需時間，不如緩發，免得求遠則不達也。</p>

<p>（六）電容器</p>
<p>電之作用，和水有很多相似的地方。所以淺易的說明電學上的原理，多用水來　　喻。以前講電流，電壓，電阻，都　喻過，現在要講電容器，仍就借水來倣引子。水可以用器具　容起來，盛水的器具可以辦爲容器。電也可以用金屬片收容起來，所以容電的器具，可以稱作電容器。（Ｃｏｏｄｅｎｇｅｒ）</p>
<p>今如有一片玻璃，在他的兩面，各貼一張　　大小的金屬片（如錫箔）在後用乾電池將其正負兩端，各接於錫箔上，一觸以後，立即除去。如此則錫箔上便留有電氣。這情形和裝水入桶一般。在電學上，裝電入容器，名爲充電（Ｃｈａｒｇｅ）。充電以後，再用一根導線二端接觸於錫箔的兩面　則導綫上即有電流流通。這情形和從水桶放水一般，稱爲放電（Ｄｉｓｂｈａｒｇｅ）。</p>
<p>木桶盛水之容量，視桶之大小而定。桶大則容水量亦大。電容器亦然，他的容量，（Ｃａｐａｃｉｔｙ）視金屬片相對的面積和其　離。及中間絶緣物的種類而定。相對的面積愈大。距離愈近，則容量亦愈大。反之則愈小。</p>
<p>水容量之單位，以桶或担計。電容量之單位則爲法拉特（Ｆａｒａｄ）。略稱Ｆ。但在無線電學上，一Ｆ之容量太大，故常以一Ｆ之百萬之一爲單位，稱爲買克羅法拉特，</p>
<p>（Ｍｉｃｒｏ　Ｆａｒａｄ）略稱ｕＦ或，其又百萬分之一則爲Ｍｉｃｒｏ　ＭｉｏｒｏＦａｒａｄ，略稱ｕｕＰ。普通所謂容量０００２５ＭＦＤ即０００００００００２５Ｆ亦即２５０ｕｕｕＦ</p>
<p>無線電學上所常用之電容器有二種，一爲容量固定的，一爲容量可變的，前者以若干極薄之金屬片分爲一組。相間而置，中各隔以絶緣物，（大部用雲母片）（如圖）而後各組各片自相連接。如此而相對之面積大，而容量一可以加多。後者亦以金屬片分或二組，其一組可以自由　動，出入於他組之間，以加减兩者相對的面積。其絶緣物，則利用空氣。如圖下方。</p>
<p>電容器在無線電圖表上，常以Ｃ字表之，而其符號則固定電容器爲而可變電容器爲或</p>

<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>據說如今已經是文明世界了，人類是文明的。譬如歐美人，就常以文明國人自詡，而中國的高等華人，文明紳士們也常以（野蠻）來斥駡那些（不文明）的下等華人。（野蠻）恰巧是（文明）的反面。</p>
<p>文明云者，就是使人類享福的東西，譬如福特飛機或Ｃａｄｉｌｌａｃ的汽車之類，方便極了。此外如衣有毛織，絲織，棉織，乃至於愛國綢，自由紡，（九一八）縐，：：：食有中西大菜，海味山珍，住有中式，西式，羅馬式或東方式，石造或水泥造，：：：雖然人類還不能普遍的享受這文明的恩惠，然而文明是已經無孔不入的存者了：有些人在受文明的苦，但也有些人在享文明的福。所以有些人於謀生之餘，還要（打打麻將），塡（解放詞），塡或看看肥臀艷舞，來歡暢這文明的成功了。</p>
<p>然而文明人旣斥駡不文明的人爲（野蠻），從這裏，却透露了一點消息：（野蠻）仍和（文明）同在。隨手舉一個例罷：</p>
<p>就在不久以前，有一位朋友僥倖從獄裏出來，他說，一進獄去，照例先要盤問，盤問的時候，是要用刑罰的，坐老虎橙或自來水灌鼻孔之類。受刑的感覺如何，别人他不知道，他自己，是經過刑訊之後，痛苦倒并不覺得，只是把那些考問和用刑的人仔細審視了好久，總覺有些異樣，不能相信那就是和他自己一樣的人類，他疑心那是另外一種凶狠的野獸；然而反覆辨認，他們又都一律生着人類的外貌，穿着人類的衣冠。於是開始感觷欠類對自己的同類會有如此殘酷，世界還這麽（野蠻）。</p>
<p>他帶着這異常的感覺進到牢獄裏面去，會見了和他一樣受拘囚的囚犯，起初，是對他們存着戒心，因爲維護法律的人已有那麽殘酷，犯法的當然更不必問。繼而看見他們待自己却和待骨肉親人一樣的親切，不免起了疑心，以前的感覺竟發生了動搖。這裏又使他感到人類實在是（文明）的可以親近。然而一到觸動了身上的傷痕，感到痛楚，又覺得人類（野蠻）。</p>
<p>其實這并没有什麽難懂；人類本來是文明的，但一到對立的時候，却（野蠻）了。</p>
<p>然而，這裏却顯然有了（野蠻）的存在，和（文明）恰恰相反。</p>
<p>文明與否，是看人類用來生活的手段如何。這手段不外乎對待自然和對待同類。前者的文明，是已經多少使人類蒙受了幸福，而後者却至今還在使人受苦，至今還是（野蠻）的。</p>
<p>水是流着的，浮在水上的船也是流着的，倘使這船忽然不動，那一定是觸着了礁石，或擱淺在沙灘上了。那麽阻碍了人類文明的一半的東西是什麽呢？</p>
<p>然而我并不是基督主義者，或人道主義者，有什麽（人道）之念，感而發此；因爲，只要是消滅人類的野蠻和殘酷，卽使用野蠻與殘酷的手段，於我也並無所惜的。救國捐也好，航空捐也好，我都曾慷慨輸將。</p>
<p>人類已經有一半是文明的了，那就是對待自然。倘使能把那一半對同類的野蠻也除去，豈止文明可以普澤羣生，而且整個人類也從獅身人面的原形脫胎了。然而，那不先用道理可以說得清的。</p>
<p>但我想，這時間也并不久。</p>

<p>丨給我的哥哥丨（續）</p>
<p>我說過了我没有說過的話，我做過了我没有做過的事。而那些話和那些事都是和我的思想相反背的。有些人在小報上揑造了種種奇異的我的生平。有些人在（訪問記）（印象記）等等文章裏面使我變　他們那樣的人，說他們心裏的話。我的一篇　置的幾年前的開玩笑的短稿，會署上現在的名字出現於南洋報的紀念刊。我的一封給朋友的短信會發表在ＸＸ機關報的副刊上。我的一篇舊短稿曾被一個朋友當作禮物來贈送給一位編輯。我　文章給一份雜誌轉載後又被改了題目在各處登廣告，使一些年青朋友疑心我得了那雜誌的巨額稿費（你知道我從没有得過那雜誌的一文稿費）；在我的旅行中一位編輯寄了他的大作來　我批評，我忠實地在回信裏寫了我的意見，而我的信却給人家删改後在雜誌上發表了。我有一部譯稿被一個從南洋回來的朋友要去出版，我自己校對，自己交涉印刷。書出以後他不給我一文稿費，不付一文印刷費，反而在背後駡我平肯給他，幫忙結果他的書店關了門，這部譯稿又流落到另一。書店編輯的手裏，那編輯要我售給他爲了幾個朋友的緣故我答應了。而如今那編輯在這本小書出版了一年以後，却把牠拿到别的書店去兜售，還在外面揚言說我欠了他的　没有錢償還，拿譯稿來作抵。（這類的事還多着呢，在這文壇上在這出版界裏，是充滿着便一個眞實的人苦笑，呻吟的事情的，我没有時間把牠們全都說給你聽。）我看見一個人說過幾句話，於是這人就把我和他或她的言語和行動連接在一起而傳布出去。我憎恨在東方文化這名稍所掩護的一切舊的骸骨，而别人偏偏要寄舊的詩詞給我，同時却自以爲是很了解我。</p>
<p>這樣我竟然成了少爺小姐們玩弄的工具了。不但我的言語和行動被人强姦，而我的思想也幾次被人强姦了。我的思想是以最　愛的東西！而别人連這點思想的自由也要給角奪去！但是這兩年來我不曾發出過一聲抗議。我只是苦笑，我只是呻吟。因爲他們說他們都是我的朋友。</p>
<p>你不知道我如今是怎樣地憎恨我的名字呵！有幾次在不眠的夜裏，我猛烈地抓我的頭髮，我猛烈地打我的胸膛。强烈的憎恨割痛我的心，無邊的黑暗包圍着我。那時候我眞希望能夠有一個力量來把我自己毁滅掉。我實在不能夠忍受這種生活了。我明明是愛我的文章的，而現在我的文章却被糟塌得使我不得不憎恨牠們了。這情形就像一個母親看見她的她子被人摧殘得失了人形。那苦痛你也該了解罷。</p>
<p>現在無論如何我是應該把過去的生活結束了。爲了做一個眞實勇敢的人，爲了忠於我自己的信仰，爲了使的不致有親手割斷我的生命的一天，我應該遠離開那些文人，我應該投身在實　生活裏面，在行動中去找力量，如我在（斷魂的呼號）所希望的。這就是我所說的（拿生命來作孤注一擲）意義了。</p>
<p>我究竟還有没有擺脫掉一切的包圍而得到新生的一天，這我自己也不知道。但我如今是在</p>
<p>呼號了。你是我的唯一的哥哥，我希望你在危險和困苦中時時記念着我，給我祝福！（完）</p>

<p>（一，二，三，）分明無意識地，這女</p>
<p>人又重複地數女孩子又嘻嘻地戇笑。這時，灰白頭髮的蘭斯托人，屈向前方。</p>

<p>（二十二）公車上書</p>
<p>康有爲五游京邑，七次上書，而以公車上書爲尤晨驚天下。嘗自爲詩以紀其事曰，東事戰敗，聯十八省舉人三千人上書。次日美使田貝索稿，爲人傳鈔，刻徧天下，題曰公車上書記。是時主和者爲軍機大臣孫毓汶，衆怒甚，孫畏不朝，遂辭位。詩云：</p>
<p>海東龍泣艦没波，上相輶軒出議和，遼臺嘸膴割山河。抗章伏闕公車多，連名三千轂相摩，聯軫五里塞巷過。臺人號泣秦檜歌，九城謠諜徧網羅。扛棺摩拳，擊鼓三撾。檜避不朝，辭位畏訶。美使田貝驚士氣則那！索稿傳鈔，天下墨爭磨。嗚呼！椎秦不成奈若何！</p>
<p>吾人披讀此詩，可以想見當時公車上書運動之陣容，政府當局之如何戒備。至宰執肯引咎而退，蓋猶有所謂清議者存也。先是中日和約十一欵一權大臣畫押之電告抵京，舉國譁然。内而郎曹，外而疆吏，咸有諍論。其聲勢最盛，發言最激者，惟公車之士子，于禮闈試畢之後，擊登聞鼓，爭相上書。初則廣東舉人梁啓超等百餘人，湖南舉人任錫純文俊鐸譚紹裳等數十人，首詣都察院呈請代奏，旣而福建四川江西貴州諸省繼之，旣而江蘇湖北陜甘廣西諸省繼之，又旣而直隸山東山西河南雲南諸省繼之。蓋自二月二十八，三十，四月初二，初四，初六等日，都察院雙日堂期，門外車馬喧　，冠袵雜𨖼，議論鼎沸，呌�</p>
<p>囂徹天。書上數日不報，各省公車再大聯合，同上一書，推廣東舉人康有爲（祖詒）主其事。書長（萬八千餘字，首云（具呈舉人康祖詒等爲安危大計，乞下明詔，行大賞罰，遷都練兵變通新法，以塞和欵而拒外夷，保疆土而延國命，呈請代奏事。）中述乞皇上下詔鼓天下之氣，遷都定天下之本，練兵强天下之勢，變法成天下之治。所謂鼓天下之氣者，一下罪已之詔，二下明罰之詔，三下求才之詔。所謂定天下之本者，厥惟遷都長安一事。所謂强天下之勢者，一爲選將，二爲購械，三爲編練華僑軍。所謂成天下之治者，一爲富國之法曰鈔法，曰鐵道，曰機器輪舟，曰開礦，曰鑄銀，曰郵政。二爲養民之法，曰務農，曰勸工，曰惠商，曰卹窮。卹窮之法曰移墾，曰敎工，曰養窮。三爲敎民之法，試士分文科藝科而廢武科。並遍設書藏，奬勵報紙，提倡道學。四爲革新政治之法，裁冗官，　廪祿，儲使才，遣游學，選議郎，徵民兵。末謂今若百度更新，以二萬里之地，四萬萬之人，二十六萬種之物產，力圖自强，此眞日本之所大患，而歐羅巴洲諸國所竊憂也。若徘徊遲疑，苟且度日，因循守舊，坐失事機，則諸夷環伺，間不容髮，雖有聖者，無以善其後矣。文旣脫稿，乃在宣武城南松筠菴之諫草堂傳觀會議，菴者明臣楊椒山之故宅也。和欵本定於四月十四日在烟臺換約，故公呈亦擬於初十日向都察院投遞，初七八九三日爲會議之期。乃一時訂和之使，主和之臣，恐人心洶湧，局將有變，遽於初八日請將和欵蓋用璽印，發使齎行。惜乎書未上而議已定，徒見此洋洋灑灑文爲人傳鈔，刻徧大下，又何有哉？</p>

<h3 id="c297">航空與防空 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>前不久，我曾寫過一篇關於（航空救國）的東西，主張在　　高喊（　錢買飛機）的當兒，除了每個人應當拿出錢來（其實，這根本是不通的，然而不如此簡直没有辦法）以外，更須積極訓練飛行及作戰的人員，設廠自製飛機，探採汽油，因爲此三問題不先解决，則國人的喉嚨喊破，或是（買的）飛機雖然竟多得無地可安置，而（國）仍然無從得（救），亦且將產生新的更大的危機來，</p>
<p>但與（航空）同等重要而亦急須與（航空）同時布置者，即爲（防空），我們翻開前日本報，在第二張上發現兩個關於我們敵人的空軍消息，</p>
<p>（一）他們正在積極訓練（由浜松至臺灣）行程往還五千公里的長途作戰，</p>
<p>（二）在鄕軍人吉田勝喜發明構造精巧之（輕防空砲），聞此項新式兵器有六支砲身，對於如飛機等高速度行動之物件，自動確定標準而得自由發砲云云，</p>
<p>觀此兩個消息，可知敵人正在埋頭努力於空戰之攻守訓練及設備，我們再環顧有飛機的各國，無一國不在研究（防空）的計劃，無一國不在盡力（防空）的演習，然而我們自己呢？（買飛機而已矣）！（買飛機而已矣）！好像飛機一（買來），（國一不但因此一（買）而便得（救），而且敵機就會望風披靡的樣子，試問這樣慌張之態而形於顏色，又怎能不給敵人笑我爲無組織的國家呢？</p>
<p>有人說，中國根本就無需乎用飛機飛行，因爲中國本來就有能夠（飛行）的人，你看，前幾天報上加了花邊載着的，不是某主席正在徵求飛簷走壁的人才嗎，（簷壁）之上可以（飛走），當然可以騰空飛行；能夠飛行於空氣之中，不介是效用與飛機同等嗎？是故中國人儘可不必出錢向外國人買飛機，當然更可以不必談（防空），因爲人是活靈的，飛在空中可以隨心而動，並可以飛在敵人的飛機上帶着一把（大刀）將敵人的機葉砍掉而使失其效用，這豈不比所謂（防空）乾凈許多嗎！因此證明某主席用心是良苦的，</p>
<p>然而這究竟是廢話，滑天下之大稽的，不過亦可知道中國人之閒情逸致，與没出息，比之敵人之處心積慮陰險毒辣，眞不可以道路計，</p>
<p>但空談（航空），或是一味（捐錢買飛機），其没出息與閒情逸致，亦必具異曲同工之妙，所以我說，</p>
<p>（一）不多多訓練飛行及作戰的人員，不如乾脆把（買來的）飛機送給敵人，免和暴殄天物，給世界人士笑掉了牙齒，</p>
<p>（二）不自製飛機和汽油，倒還是爽快些國人自把準備捐出向外國（買飛機）的錢，各自匯到外國去孝敬洋人，免得空勞一班（熱心救國）的大人先生的金神而給他們傷心，</p>
<p>（三）不（防空），簡直可以不必（航空），而（國）亦儘可不必（救），否則只等於拿（買來的）飛機無條件的去作敵人（輕防空砲）的活靶，或是老實像張少帥一樣慷慨地把幾百飛機送給敵人去塗塗了顏色，好來炸我們中國人民的生命和房產，</p>

<p>— 匡</p>
<p>爭是一個多麽不吉祥的字呵，自己没有佔有的福份，却只有靠爭來抓辦法，毋怪古來君子，合十唸（阿彌陀佛）的出家佛，（人掌我左頰，再承之以右頰）的耶蘇敎主，一向都很鄙視反對。不料好爭之徒，計上心來，乃把這字面改換一下，而其内涵則仍如舊，比如（角雄）（逐鹿）（：：：）就是這麽一番道理。</p>
<p>爭果然不是門檻，試看古人的喟嘆：（爭地以戰，殺人盈野，爭城以戰，殺人盈城），以爭而致殺人盈（野盈城，其罪誠可滔天矣。於是非爭之哲人輩出，製定哲學曰：（君子尚禮，小人尚爭），在西歐，也有這麽一位賢哲，想來誰都知道，安那其主義的開山祖師克魯泡特金先生，著了一部（互助論），力倡非爭之說，這書在中國早已有譯本，記得前北京有遇一次（青年必讀書十種）的徵求，也有學者名士把這部互助論選進出了的。不知怎的却觸犯了似洪水猛獸的馬克斯先生的肝火，他又來著一部反克氏的互助論的名著丨（哲學之貧因），他不但抨擊克氏的互助論，更澈底主張階級之爭，是爲爭之尤者矣。</p>
<p>於是乎（爭）之一字，畢竟不能毁滅，而爭之道遂益廣，爭的事實也就無孔不入了。</p>
<p>别人欺侮我，我不甘屈服，訴諸法庭，當開庭的時候，少不了一塲（據理以爭）。就是現在的國家間偶然動起兵戎，弱國恐懼失措，遂亦訴諸（國際法庭）（國際聯盟），這不但要（據理以爭），聽說還要爲（維護公理而爭）。若是在臂膊要断矣！　青永作</p>
<p>法庭也爭不過，便只有背了寃單向社會人士之前去爭，像女相士聞鶯被害，伊母不服法院判决，乃於日前背寃單入京，向各司法機關伸寃，聞頗有成效。</p>
<p>推而至於（食前方丈，侍妾若干）的闊人富家，大小老婆之爭丈夫，聽說也往往爭得撕破衣褲，甚至短刀相見，爭破腦袋，妻妾間原也有這麽一套。</p>
<p>推而至於兩個男子追逐一個女子，或是兩個女子追逐一個男子，也免不了有（爭鋒）之一幕，而且據說這爭的成份最强，爲的是醋意太深。所以，雖然弱又子如陶思瑾者，爲了想佔有文學家許欽文先生，遂以菜刀劈落劉夢瑩女士的五寸艷頸，惹得自己如今還在吃司官。</p>
<p>抑有文人學士，窮到了無路可讚的時候，也要來二三句（爲生活而爭（掙字原由爭字所出）扎）的呼聲，或來一套（力爭言論自由），惟此二者，頗不易爭得也。</p>
<p>却說咱們貴國的人，最愛與黄包車夫爭一二個銅板，往往爭得面紅露痙，未敢稍讓。</p>
<p>古有（鷸蚌相爭，漁人得利），而今的一般武人政客，就正在盛玩這一套，東四省儘可被日兵佔奪，内爭却不可或息，一幕一幕的在我們的眼前放映。往往一度内爭過後，便來一度和平，然後又來一度内爭，循環起伏，相承相生，結果弄到今日這種情形！國運日替，民不聊生。</p>
<p>然則，爭之道，其若是乎？曰：在中國果若是而已。</p>
<h3 id="c300">北平的（安民佈告）書後 <a href="#c300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— 徐訏</p>
<p>灤東失敗了後，平津人心惶惶，北平市長宣佈了安民佈告曰：（一）北平公安局已組織戰時警察隊，充實警戒力，</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>並與軍隊合作，維持治安，（二設）防空施，業已完畢，飛機雖出現於北平空際，决不能留長時間，（三）平津鐵路，已派路敬澈夜警戒，敵國陰謀，决不能實現云云，（實抄四月二十日大晚報）不知當地小百姓們讀了作何感想？</p>
<p>我是曾經做過北平小百姓的人，每次内戰到離平津近了的時候，每次都讀到相彷的佈告。起初我是十分懷疑，以爲十多萬的軍隊都不能抵抗的（敵人）（？），怎麽能由警察去抵抗呢？於是我心中更加（惶惶）。</p>
<p>這，我相信，在上海的朋友們，一定也以爲我這個問題發得有理，或者當你們在報上讀到佈告時，早就先我而發這個疑問了。</p>
<p>定也以爲我這個問題發得有理，或者當　　其實，後來事實告訴我這個疑問是不對的。</p>
<p>我在北平經騐過許多次内戰時候的（惶惶），所以不久的後來我就知道佈告的意義。於是我看着那般新來的居民讀佈告後而復（惶惶）者，反而覺得可笑起來。因爲我已經由小百姓變成老百姓，所以那佈告的確是（安我大吉了）。</p>
<p>因爲經騐告訴我情形是這樣的：那所謂（戰時警察隊）之類，是除用舉槍禮送甲軍隊悄悄從後門出去外，還要用舉槍禮來歡迎前門進來的乙軍隊的。</p>
<p>乙軍隊進來後，一切都是照舊，除了報上有些一代皇帝一朝臣）之變化外，那般警察是從來無所變化的。</p>
<p>（惶惶）之道，原在怕流彈亂飛，搶刦，巷戰而言，所以這樣一來，除富商要解些襄去送往迎來以外，其餘是用不着什麽（惶惶）。</p>
<p>算起我（惶惶）的經騐，要推國民軍北伐到平津的時候；那時所謂（惶惶），還在内戰以外的（内戰）。</p>
<p>那時，天津有張宗昌，北平是張作霖，派出十萬雄（便衣偵探）來偵探所謂（便衣隊者）。當時北伐軍之致勝原因，賴（便衣隊）者實多，所以擴充（便衣偵探），確是一個以毒攻毒的辦法。然而（便衣隊）出没無常，與（共產黨）相仿，常隱匿於青年之中，而出入乎大學之府，所以我們大學生也者，被（便衣偵探）偵探爲（便衣隊）者也特别可能。所以這（戰時便衣偵探），是最能使人（惶惶）的東西，與（戰時警察隊）有些兩樣的。</p>
<p>一過話還要說回來，當時也還有一個（與軍隊合作）的警察隊的，他們是威風凛凛，雄氣騰騰，白天深夜得自由地到各處搜查；有一個女生們合租的房子，是三次五次地被他們深夜搜查過，她們知道的一定比我多，這裏也不想多說</p>
<p>但這二者所提去的犯罪，是有一個顯然的分别，無論證據是紅綢軸子（不要笑這是事實，曾被認爲是滿地紅旗的。）或者是同情窮人的小刊物，或者是三民主義，或者所謂先總理的演講與遺囑；一到便衣偵探之手就成爲（便衣隊），而一到（與軍隊合作）的警察隊手裏立刻就成（共產黨）；但二者都是（死刑），這是同樣的。</p>
<p>然而北伐軍進城了，最先掛出青天白日滿地紅旗者就是頭一天還槍斃過藏有這種旗的人的執行公署。</p>
<p>而將青天白日的帽章用的，不是未死的（便衣隊），而是槍斃過（便衣隊）的警察。</p>
<p>有一次，我還在警察署裏看見一個曾經查我們有數十次之多的，也曾經捕過我藏有三民主義的許我朋友的警察，在讀一本三民主義的敎产書；詢問之下，知是爲考（黨義）而用，這使我恍然悟到了一切！</p>
<p>然而，凡此種種，都與這次（戰時警察隊）完全兩樣，不過由此，有一點可以知道，那就是他們的責任不是在禦侮，而在治安，所澈夜警戒者不是在（敵國），而是（敵國陰謀）；（敵國陰謀）者，是以前（便衣隊）之流亞，乃（漢奸）是也！</p>
<p>信筆至此，忽然想起報上　人有將平津充緩衝地之提議。於是一個（緩衝警察隊）之槪念，不禁使我（惶惶）起來。</p>
<p>要是眞的同以前内戰時我好幾次看到一樣，那這個（安民佈告）使在遙遠的上海小右姓之我（惶惶）了！</p>
<p>哎唷！讀者們，請原諒我！我忽然頭痛如裂，目眩眼花，但見他們那些，都拿出（僞旗），掛起（僞帽章），捧起（僞義）：：：來了！恕我不能多寫。</p>

<h3 id="c301">搬家難 <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 吴用</p>
<p>記得在故鄕的時候，帮助隣居親戚搬家的時候，常聽到這一番話：（莊稼人搬家眞不容易呵！俗語說得好：（搬家十年窮。）這句話一點都不錯。窮人搬一回家，蓋一個小飯棚呵，三十二十花上了！人家都來帮忙，就查伺候，少說也要三塊兩塊！這年頭什麽都貴，糧食不值錢，修修這裏，修修那裏，處處都要錢！這些錢那裏來的？還不是從那幾斤糧食裏出嗎？）</p>
<p>是的，搬家眞不容易，我很明白。最近看了報上登載的日軍在熱河的暴行，更證明了我的理論的正確。（：：：女子因被日軍姦污，多自殺。尤慘者，日軍因華女不肯將其牛羊牽去，與日軍爭執，日兵並用槍剌洞穿孕婦數人復部而死。（作者註：復内的小孩子當然也剌惟此而矣　紫嶶</p>
<p>死了？）廣大的中華民衆，經過這樣的殘害，爲什麽還不搬家呢？當然，就是因爲搬家難，没錢搬家，一點也不錯。　　不過話說到這裏，却應該加上一段小註，就是：（爲民衆謀利益）的治者和（南北奔走，爲國拚命。）的富人却是列外。因爲他們的（責任重大，）所以應該保存性命，因爲要保存性命，所以要搬家，而且搬起來當然並不困難。</p>
<p>日軍南來則向北搬（古物財寳之類隨行。），日軍北來則向南搬，日軍東來則向西搬，反正日軍不能從西面來，不致於搬到東海裏去，這眞是很萬幸的事情！</p>
<p>至於有經濟眼光的，當然預先花上一千萬，五百萬，在外國租界裏設上私宅，把家眷搬過去，一可省來回亂搬的麻煩，更可避免飛機及一切危險，（保存實力，以備抗日！）豈不妙哉，至於不便設在租界裏的機關等類，當然比較來來回回有些煩麻，但是在交通便利的現在，也算不了什麽！</p>
<p>除了以上這段小註裏所講的不得已的情形以外，我還是一致的主張！搬家這事是很困難的，一點都不錯！所以只好不搬，眞正的去（抗日）！</p>

<p>走進一家帶買小吃的茶樓，伍逸隨便揀個位子坐了，李金標却先除下了頭上那頂有硬舌頭的巡官帽，又把衣服整了一整，然後才直挺挺地望伍逸下首的那一張方櫈子上坐下。</p>
<p>（究竟是怎樣的一回事呢）？茶過一巡，伍逸忍不住便提到正文上來。</p>
<p>（說來眞一椿大笑話）！李巡官很斯文地喝了半杯子紅茶，含着笑說道：（伍校長，我眞不懂人總是這樣一個腦子，爲什麽靈的就比鬼怪還靈，什麽刁）</p>
<p>鑽古怪的心思都想得出來！：：：）</p>
<p>（但是，咱們不要：：：）伍逸聽他一味發空論，忙來不及的阻止。</p>
<p>（那末就說今兒這一件事罷）！李金標又喝了一口茶。（今兒報上不是登着許什麽樵的一段新聞嗎。咱們廳長一瞧之後，便起了一個老大的疑心：第一，前幾天爲什麽不曾聽見出過什麽綁架的案子；第二，狀元巷是鬧市，咱們三區四分所就在那裏，要是眞出了什麽案子，咱們還有臉嗎：第三，某國人無論怎樣凶法，也斷不致膽敢在京城裏胡鬧；：：：他左想也不像，右想也不對，便馬上傳我們三區的林區長去，呌他快派人往四處去打聽，務必把這件事情調查明白：：：）</p>
<p>伍逸聽得出了神，手裏擎着一個空杯子，老是不放下去，李巡官當他是還想茶喝，忙打斷了話，提起壺來給他斟。</p>
<p>（别忙！别忙！說你的）！伍逸搶着把壺接了過來，没口嘴的催他快說。</p>
<p>（咱們林區長不敢怠慢，當下便親自趕上各報館去打聽，問他們這消息是打那裏來的，大家都說是一個什麽通信訊送來的；林區長忙又趕到那通信社云，一瞧這通信訊原來就跟那後援會設在一起，社長也就是那許什麽樵。其時裏面却不見有一個辦事的，祇剩兩三個當差，林區長便問他們姓的家在那裏，這一問，可就問出馬脚來了，兩三個人你瞧着我，我瞧着你的老是支吾着不說；林區長瞧這情形不對，忙打了個電話給我們二區六分所，敎我們就近派幾個弟兄去。於是我就帶着三個弟兄趕去見他，他先敎我們一個人守門，一個人守電話，不准他們通消息，他自己一面又竭力向那三個當差的盤問，和半嚮，才有一個說出了那許什麽樵的住宅來：：：。）</p>

<p>（啊！他不是已受了傷啦）？伍逸認爲這事情太不近情理，忙揷口質問着。</p>
<p>（你别岔我啊！伍校長！你聽底下就明白了）！李金標不先答復伍逸的質問，儘講事實。（本來我和林區長都不認得他，也是那當差的指出來的，林區長瞧他長得肥頭胖耳，唇紅齒白，别說不像遍體　傷，不像徒步四五十里，簡直比咱們也壯健得多了，心上已明白了一半。那姓許的見是他底下人引來的，知道是不能脫身了，反堆起了一臉的笑，來不及的把我們讓進去。：：：</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops in Xinglong Have Been Repelled <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning at dawn, the enemy seemed to have received reinforcements, increasing the number of artillery pieces along the entire Nantianmen line by thirty to forty, bringing the total to no fewer than sixty to seventy. Approximately five to six thousand infantrymen launched a fierce assault on our South Route Contingent. Our troops calmly responded, repelling them all. The enemy seems determined to seize Nantianmen. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun dispatch: From 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM, the enemy subjected the Nantianmen position to intense bombardment with dozens of artillery pieces and over a hundred aircraft, destroying most of the fortifications. Our defending troops suffered heavy casualties. The enemy followed with up to seven infantry assaults. Xu Tingyao and Guan Linzheng personally oversaw the resistance at the front lines, bolstering morale. After a day of bloody fighting, the enemy suffered thousands of casualties, and there was no change in our position. At 10:00 AM, the enemy added over three thousand infantrymen at Yangzhuang Chahe shore, and used tanks to cover a large cavalry force, assaulting the Huangtuliang area, about a thousand meters east of Chetouyu, impacting our 囗部. After our resistance, they did not gain an inch. Near Heilongtan, over a thousand enemy infantrymen attempted to invade. Our troops near Bijia Mountain are preparing an attack. (28th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun dispatch: The enemy's previous attack on Gubeikou failed. In recent days, tens of thousands of Japanese and puppet troops have been continuously增 from various locations in Luandong and Xifengkou. At 5:00 AM this morning, the enemy concentrated forty or more heavy artillery pieces, bombarding the right flank of our Nantianmen position. Their infantry, divided into three columns, took the opportunity to launch a fierce assault. Xu Tingyao deployed a portion of a certain division, flanking the enemy's rear, cutting off their head and tail. Fierce fighting is ongoing. Simultaneously, on the left flank of our Nantianmen position, dozens of enemy artillery pieces covered their infantry, launching an attack. The artillery fire was intense, and our troops fought bravely in response. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jixian dispatch: On the 28th, several enemy aircraft repeatedly bombed our Xinglong troops with extreme cruelty, resulting in over three hundred officer and soldier casualties. The enemy's stubbornly defended county office was set ablaze by our artillery fire. However, the enemy continued to utilize the surrounding walls, earth mounds, and cellars, as well as rely on Xinglong Mountain north of the county office, to resist stubbornly. A siege is still in progress. The enemy commander in Xinglong is Shimamura Eijiro, the guard commander of the Shouwangfen tombs, with a radio and using aircraft for communication, able to contact his rear. It was recently discovered that a Japanese regiment in Xinglong was planning to advance inside the Great Wall at Changchengkou. Our army was ordered to proceed to Huangyaguan to engage the enemy. Xinglong was retaken on the morning of the 27th, and the enemy troops fled towards Yaowangmiao and Huayuan on the 25th. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) At all positions on the Nantianmen front line today, the enemy launched fierce assaults with heavy troops and artillery in multiple directions. Xu Tingyao personally went to the front lines at dawn to oversee the resistance, greatly boosting morale. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Enemy Concentrates Along the Re-Nan Great Wall Line <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The recent deployment of Japanese and puppet troops along the Great Wall and the Rehe border is as follows: The Gubeikou 口 area is defended by the Kawahara Brigade and over two thousand Mongolian soldiers. The area between Chengde, Kuancheng, Xinglong, and Gubeikou is defended by the Pumu and Nishiyi Divisions. The area between Xifengkou and Luowenyu is defended by the Hattori and Suzuki Brigades. Lengkou is defended by the Itaki Division. The Rehe North Motegi Cavalry Brigade and the Takada Detachment are moving towards Shouwangfen. Jielingkou is defended by the Nakamura Brigade. Yuguan and Jiukou are defended by the Iwata and Sakawa Detachments and Li Jichun's puppet troops. Suizhong is defended by the Hiraga Brigade. Fengning is defended by the Miyake Mixed Cavalry Detachment. The area between Rehe North Linxi and Jingpeng is defended by Liu Guitang and Huang Xiling's puppet troops. The area around Wudan, Chifeng, Weichang, Zhuizishan, and Xinghua is defended by Zhang Haipeng's puppet troops of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th detachments, as well as Li Shoushan's unit. It can be seen that the main force of the Japanese army is now concentrated along the Re-Nan Great Wall line. The area around Xinglong, between Xifengkou and Gubeikou, has a particularly large garrison. The enemy's intentions towards Luowenyu and Malanguan are very obvious. Only a portion of puppet troops are in Rehe West. Jingpeng is still 480 li from Duolun, and Weichang is still 340 li from Duolun, so the situation in East Chahar is not as serious as rumors suggest.

The next morning, six enemy aircraft concentrated artillery fire, launching a fierce assault on our position. Enemy aircraft dropped bombs. Our certain unit 囗囗 defended the area, engaging in fierce fighting with the enemy. We suffered casualties, including a battalion commander and a machine gun battalion commander, as well as over two hundred soldiers. Enemy casualties were even heavier. Our division commander Liu Kan directed the battle throughout the night, and the enemy ultimately failed. Our army continues to hold its original defenses. The battles on the 27th and 28th were especially fierce. Hand-to-hand combat occurred four or five times, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Our army has now changed its operational plans, calmly responding during the day, organizing special detachments, and utilizing night attacks. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Xu Tingyao reported by telephone that the enemy's infantry and artillery launched an all-out assault today, and eight aircraft repeatedly bombed our positions. Most of the fortifications on the front and flanks of our Nantianmen position have been destroyed. From dawn to noon, our army also launched four counterattacks against the enemy, but without success. Casualties have reached over six hundred. Several locations on both sides of the position have been leveled by enemy shells, leaving no time for repairs. Our officers and soldiers are currently engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. (28th Dispatch)</p>

A certain regiment used machine guns to shoot down an enemy aircraft, which was burned by us. The enemy in the county consisted of over three hundred mixed Japanese and puppet troops. A certain unit of ours launched a fierce attack on Xinglong at 4:00 AM on the 27th, charging into the streets, resulting in prolonged street fighting. The enemy retreated to the county office. We fiercely attacked the county office, advancing and retreating several times. The enemy used machine guns to fire intensely, resulting in over a hundred officer and soldier casualties.

<p>(Beiping) This time, the Japanese army's withdrawal is a strategy to use all their strength to break through one of our positions. The enemy has deployed the main forces from all directions to the Gubeikou area. The 20th Division has arrived there in recent days. The Japanese army in that area has orders from headquarters to capture the Nantianmen to Miyun line, sparing no effort in launching fierce assaults. This proves that the Japanese people's propaganda that they will no longer advance south of the Great Wall is entirely false propaganda to deceive the world. We must sacrifice ourselves for a final decisive battle. (28th Dispatch)</p>

The enemy has established a brigade headquarters at Hengchengzi outside the pass. Our defending troops at Panjiakou and Luowenyu are also building strong defenses, and the enemy is unlikely to attack easily. An order has been issued to the front lines not to advance lightly, and there is no active offensive posture. The two sides are currently facing each other inside and outside the pass.

The Japanese army near Lengkou scattered and fled, abandoning many light and heavy weapons. The defection of Shao's unit is due to the fact that several puppet army units have been disarmed and dismissed by the enemy army, and have been mistreated, driven by their conscience, hence this action.

<p>(Tianjin) A certain dignitary talked about the reasons for the retreat of enemy rebels in Luandong: (1) Since the start of the war, they have suffered heavy casualties, gradually revealing their weaknesses, hence the retreat out of the pass for replenishment. (2) Our defenses in Luanxi are solid. In addition, due to the relationship of the Bei-Ning Railway, the enemy has withdrawn troops to show no intention of infringing on British and American interests. (3) To implement the strategy of defeating each enemy individually, troops from Luandong were transferred to Gubeikou to attack our Central Army, so that we would not have complete troops, and then look for an opportunity to attack with all our strength, and then drive straight in. In the bloody battle at Nantianmen for days, we suffered more than two thousand casualties, and the enemy suffered twice as many. Today, from morning to night, the battle was also very fierce. We suffered more than two hundred casualties. The range and power of the enemy's artillery were superior to ours. In comparison, the enemy had seven artillery pieces for every one of ours. We have about 100,000 troops in that area, so there is no immediate danger. Tianjin can temporarily maintain a small scale of prosperity. (28th Dispatch)</p>

The supplies and ordnance for the Japanese army in Shenyang, which is heading to various passes in Rehe and the Great Wall, are still being continuously transported to our passes, and they are also attempting to defeat our troops at each pass individually.

<p>Will Undergo Significant Changes</p>
<p>Sanctions Against Aggressor Nations</p>
<p>No Longer Hesitating and Looking Back</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Min Sheng Jiang Tan Newspaper's Washington correspondent said that Roosevelt's new trend toward England and France means that American foreign policy will undergo significant changes from now on. The United States can not only modify war debts, but also participate in advisory treaties. Although the United States will still maintain its freedom of action in the future, whenever international disputes occur, and the League of Nations decides to cut off relations with the aggressor nation in the dispute to isolate it, the United States should express its attitude toward this matter. Because Britain and other countries have long hesitated and considered aggressor nations, and do not easily declare a blockade, the reason for this hesitation is precisely because they do not know whether the blockade will cause conflict with the United States. Now that the United States has the obligation to express its attitude, whenever a certain country is recognized by the League of Nations as an aggressor, whether the United States still wants to maintain the principle of freedom of the seas, and whether it still wants to maintain diplomatic relations with the aggressor, the Washington government should clearly notify the member states of the League of Nations. Since the United States decided not to join the League of Nations, no decision by the President of the United States on foreign policy has been as important as this one, and the propositions of the United States and France can be said to be very close. President Roosevelt intends to proceed quickly, so he intends to submit this policy to Congress for discussion soon. (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>White House Denies Agreement on War Debt Issue</p>
<p>To Be Thoroughly Negotiated with All Countries in the Future</p>
<p>(Washington) When the French-American talks concluded today, French representative Herriot claimed that he and the US President had made great progress in the preparations for the World Economic Conference. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) After hearing that foreign countries said that the United States had agreed to resume suspending the payment of war debts, the White House quickly corrected it today, stating that war debts would be part of the agenda of the London World Economic Conference, and will be thoroughly negotiated with all countries after the conference is over. No agreement has been reached with the British Prime Minister or the former French Prime Minister. The United States hopes that the payments due in June will be paid as usual. This statement by the White House is obviously intended to prevent the spread of false hopes abroad, and the sudden backlash from Congress. However, according to Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, if the government's plan to inflate the currency is adopted, debtor countries will pay their debts in silver, and the amount actually paid may be reduced by 30%. Because the President is willing to allow Congress to adopt a silver price of no more than fifty cents per ounce to accept no more than 100 million yuan of silver from each debtor country, and a majority in Congress also support using any reasonable method to improve the status of silver, it is expected that this provision will not be rejected. The current silver price is no more than thirty-six cents, and debtor countries are 大 eager to buy it first. Also, although today's statement by the White House came as a surprise to the general public, it does not mean that there was any disagreement when British Prime Minister MacDonald and US President discussed war debts, but it shows that Roosevelt wants to enable the United States to still control the war debt issue, awaiting the Economic Conference, because Luo believes that war debts and ordinary economic problems are very closely linked and cannot be solved in isolation, so he wants to thoroughly negotiate after the conference. There is already a movement to double the amount of silver paid by debtor countries, and according to Pittman, the President is also quite willing to see this happen. However, although paying debts with silver can help the rise of the silver market, if the United States implements currency inflation, the result will be minimal, and it will have little effect on the stabilization of currencies.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt met yesterday with the French representative, former Prime Minister Herriot, to discuss disarmament and security construction issues. Judging from Roosevelt's attitude, it seems that the United States intends to abandon neutrality and the principle of freedom of the seas, so that when a certain country engages in aggression, the United States can cooperate with other countries to implement economic and financial blockades against the aggressor country. Roosevelt also advocated the implementation of supervision of disarmament methods as a second method of guaranteeing security. The war debt issue will be discussed today. (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the results of the investigation, Congress was very surprised by the news that President Roosevelt intended to have the United States join the World Consultative Pact and abandon neutrality and the principle of freedom of the seas. It is generally speculated that President Roosevelt will, when necessary, present reasons directly related to the United States that can make the Senate approve, in order to promote this policy.

According to Le Petit Parisien, which is very close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the French-American talks were very satisfactory, because President Roosevelt's attitude was very close to that insisted upon by France. Regarding disarmament and security, the United States not only felt the necessity of permanent local strict control of international armaments, but also expressed its willingness to seek a way for the United States to also bear a defensive responsibility in order to deal with possible aggressors. The newspaper also stated that there may be no other way besides economic and financial resistance, so the United States is actually equal to abandoning its long-held idea that all countries have the right to freedom of action at sea in wartime.

This increase has been approved by the government. The increase in silver payments will be listed in the amendment proposed by Senator Hayden. Pittman explained the reason for the increase, saying that the amount of US debt to be repaid by various countries, including the December debt and the amount due in June of this year, is about 170 million yuan in total.

<p>Former Treasury Secretary Calls It a Dangerous Experiment</p>
<p>Inflation Bill Extended Debate</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed an amendment to the Rural Relief Act stipulating that the President has the power to reduce the gold content of the dollar (Reuters, 27th).</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate's attitude toward authorizing the President to reduce the gold content of the dollar by up to fifty percent has indicated its unwillingness to grant the President unprecedented power to inflate the currency. Today's move by the Senate broke the obstruction led by Senator Glass of a bipartisan group of conservatives seeking to prevent the granting of extraordinary powers to President Roosevelt. Critics say that the extent of inflation is now uncertain and will destroy public confidence in the currency, causing panic and ultimately collapse. However, official circles say that President Roosevelt will make good use of his power (Reuters, 27th).</p>
<p>(Washington) Former Treasury Secretary Mellon issued an article here today, predicting that the inflationary process would inevitably lead to disastrous consequences. Mellon referred to the silver bill as the issuance of unsecured currency, and the reduction of the gold content of the dollar as a dangerous experiment, but supported the gold embargo and the government's continued open market policy (Reuters, 28th).</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Senate today regained control under the government faction, but the inflation faction suffered a temporary setback due to the opposition of a Republican leader and a Democratic leader today, and was unable to vote on the inflation bill today. It is now expected that the US President may issue a statement explaining his position on inflation. Yesterday, the Republican Party used political tactics to suddenly propose a quick vote on the full cash payment of veteran benefits, restricting the motion for discussion, and absorbing a portion of the silver faction's Democrats to pass the motion. Today, the silver faction Democrats suddenly withdrew their support, making the Republican Party's clever plan to obstruct the government's inflation bill fail again. Today, Republican leader Reed then claimed that the advocacy of inflation has effectively cut off the municipal bond market and will make it impossible for cities to continue their existing unemployment plans. He proposed to revoke the provision in the inflation bill authorizing the President to reset the gold value, but it was rejected by a vote of 53 to 35. The Senate then returned to Democratic control, but Democrat Glass suddenly rose up again to oppose the reduction of the gold value (National Telegram, 27th).</p>

<p>Chinese Delegation to the League of Nations Simultaneously Issues Communiqué</p>
<p>Declaring the Determination to Resist Japan Remains Unwavering</p>
<p>(London) A certain newspaper recently reported that China and Japan have agreed on certain compromises and are about to sign them. Today, Quo Tai-chi, the Chinese Minister to the United Kingdom, specifically denied this news, saying that China and Japan have never agreed on any conditions. He also said, "China trusts the League of Nations and will never take any measures that would impair its position in the spirit and in law towards the League of Nations. China is determined to respect the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and therefore cannot have any behavior contrary to these two treaties" (Havas, 27th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation issued the following communiqué: "Recent reports stating that ceasefire negotiations have been conducted in northern China are completely untrue. The Chinese government remains determined to continue to resist Japanese aggression and will never directly negotiate a ceasefire with Japan, let alone directly negotiate to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict, because Japan's invasion of northern China is a violation of the 1901 Protocol, the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Pact of Paris, the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington, and the resolutions of the Extraordinary Assembly of the League of Nations. The Chinese government has asked some signatory countries of the 1901 Protocol to notify Japan that the Japanese troops advancing towards Peiping and Tientsin should immediately cease their advance. The determination of the Chinese troops to resist firmly shows the will of the Nanjing government." (Havas, 28th).</p>

<p>(London) The Soviet Union's stubbornness regarding the Middle East Road dispute has now drawn attention to the Manchurian affair. Today, a famous cartoonist drew a satirical picture depicting a small Japan knocking a huge China out of the ring in the boxing arena, and is now rubbing its fists, preparing to fight a huge Soviet Union in the second round of the Eastern heavyweight final. Today, all newspapers published dispatches from the Far East and Moscow in large characters, paying great attention to the increasingly entangled situation in the Far East. The Soviet Union is worried that Japanese personnel in Harbin intend to seize the management rights of the Middle East Road from the Russians, and China has denied news of Sino-Japanese peace talks. These are all things that have attracted the attention of the newspapers here. Some diplomatic reporters mentioned attempts to start negotiations, but most people believe that the Russo-Japanese dispute has made the possibility of Sino-Japanese talks even more distant. The Daily Telegraph reported that Japan may expand its military area in the name of (Manchukuo) and reach the coastal provinces of eastern Siberia. It is now believed that Japan's actions south of the Great Wall are nothing more than a feint, to cover up its important troop deployment to the north (Reuters, 28th).</p>

<p>(Washington) For the dual benefits of strengthening national defense and relieving unemployment, the US government will submit a new naval construction plan to Congress. This plan will be submitted to Congress next week by non-partisan naval figures. According to those close to naval circles, no new ships were built by the Navy during President Hoover's four years in office, but there are as many as 275 old and unsuitable ships. Furthermore, since the Washington Naval Conference, only 40 new ships have been built in the past ten years, while the United Kingdom has built 148, Japan 164, France 196, and Italy 144. The total tonnage of these new ships is 197,640 tons for the United States, 472,311 tons for the United Kingdom, 400,967 tons for Japan, 507,737 tons for France, and 297,072 tons for Italy. Therefore, according to the comparison of the number and tonnage of the above ships, the United States must quickly build 119 new ships in accordance with the ratio stipulated in the treaty, to be completed by the end of 1936 (National Telegram, 27th).</p>

<h3 id="e44">The Withdrawal of Japanese Troops from Eastern Hebei and Our Country's Countermeasures (Part 1) <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Significance and Intentions of the Japanese Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army launched the so-called "security" invasion of Rehe, they have been advancing steadily. They have seized the strategic pass of Shanhaiguan and invaded 580,000 square miles of Rehe. Along the Great Wall, all passes except for Xifengkou, which was barely maintained by Song Zheyuan's troops after a battle, have fallen into enemy hands. Even Gubeikou, which is only more than 200 miles from Peiping, has fallen into enemy hands. Our side then retreated to Nantianmen. From Lengkou to Shanhaiguan, originally known as natural barriers, all proved unable to withstand three-dimensional warfare, and were captured by the enemy. Even the five counties of Eastern Hebei have successively fallen, either occupied by the Japanese army or by puppet troops. Official telegrams stated that for strategic reasons, our troops retreated to the west bank of the Luan River and then dug trenches along the river to prepare for a long-term defense against the enemy. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army has recently retreated. Although the Japanese military authorities have issued seemingly reasonable statements explaining their reasons for withdrawing their troops, claiming that the withdrawn area is a (neutral zone), the Japanese warlords have always been untrustworthy and completely disregard trustworthiness. It is clear from past events that their statements are completely unreliable. So, what is the reason for the Japanese militarists to withdraw the Japanese troops from Eastern Hebei and the troops that invaded south of the Great Wall?</p>
<p>First. The reason why the Japanese army has been able to advance everywhere this time is that our Rehe garrison did not resist and did not make an overall war plan or mobilize the entire line. Moreover, the Japanese troops invading the west were only the entire 8th Division from Hirosaki (this division was attached to the 3rd Cavalry Brigade from Morioka), the entire 6th Division from Kumamoto, the 14th Mixed Brigade of the 7th Division from Asahikawa, the 4th Cavalry Brigade, plus two South Manchuria Railway guard battalions and one North China guard team. The total number of people is no more than 50,000, and the front line stretches 1,700 to 1,800 miles from the mouth of the Luan River to Gubeikou. If our country were to fight like a trapped beast, they would be exposed everywhere, and there would be a risk of being defeated everywhere. Therefore, in order to preserve the pinnacle of their achieved victory and to facilitate the offensive, shortening the battle line is the best strategy. At the same time, they also predicted that if the Japanese army withdrew, the Chinese army would not pursue them, so they could achieve the effect of advancing and retreating freely, while we would suffer the labor of running back and forth. Indeed, the Peiping military authorities ordered the front-line troops not to pursue them. This is the first reason why the Japanese army, based on the general situation, withdrew the troops invading Eastern Hebei.</p>
<p>Second. Although the results of the Washington fireside chats have not yet been officially announced, a relative understanding has been reached between the British Prime Minister and the US President. Even if this is not permanent, at least until the world economic panic subsides, the United Kingdom and the United States will coordinate their actions to open up trade markets and investment venues. The specific decisions still depend on the World Economic Conference. However, the understanding between the United Kingdom and the United States is approaching, and the Luo-MacDonald joint declaration has also mentioned the (silver) issue. Their desire to stabilize the Eastern market is evident on paper. Our country can be said to be the world's number one silver-using country. Although India has 1,800,500 square miles of territory and a population of over 310 million, it belongs to the same category within the economic alliance of the British Empire and is not allowed to be interfered with by outsiders. Therefore, the only country that can provide a turnaround for the world economy is our Republic of China. However, from the September 18th Incident to the present, the four northeastern provinces have been under the iron heel of the Japanese army. Our national economy has no room to breathe, let alone the ability to absorb foreign goods. If this continues, the Chinese people will have no way to survive and will inevitably rise up to seek salvation. Japan is the great enemy of the Chinese nation, and the period of struggle will be very long. Capitalist countries will inevitably suffer serious adverse effects. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States, on the one hand, want to maintain their vested interests in the Far East, and on the other hand, want to open up future markets, so they cannot but seek a temporary understanding between the two countries in order to seek stability in the Far East. In other words, they will take some action against Japan (this action may be limited to the economy). Judging from the current situation, the Kailuan Coal Mine and the Beining Railway are inevitably subject to Japan's coercion. If the Japanese army attacks again, it will inevitably cause greater difficulties internationally. Now the Middle East Road dispute is expanding, and obstacles have arisen in Japanese-Indian trade. If a dispute arises between the United Kingdom and Japan over the interests of North China, Japan will become more isolated, and its economic difficulties will be even greater than today. Therefore, in order to protect its own interests and reduce diplomatic obstacles, Japan cannot but retreat temporarily. This is the second reason why they withdrew the Japanese troops invading Eastern Hebei.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Japanese army's strength in this invasion of Rehe, as mentioned above, was only the 8th Division in Gubeikou, Fengning, Chengde, and other places, with no more than 20,000 people. The Xifengkou area was a part of the 14th Mixed Brigade and the 4th Cavalry Brigade. The various counties of Eastern Hebei, from Shanhaiguan to Lengkou, Chengzilingkou, etc., and northwest to Lingyuan, were the 6th Division and three guard battalions, mixed with puppet troops. Their weak military strength is obvious. It is only because our country is unwilling to use all its strength to resist, which has increased the arrogance of the enemy and increased their aggressive ambitions. However, they also know that they cannot easily advance again. In particular, they have to consider international relations. Therefore, they temporarily withdrew from Eastern Hebei to weaken our country's hatred of the enemy and to ease the international atmosphere. However, the Japanese have many tricks. If, on the other hand, they concentrate their forces to control our Gubeikou and further covet our Duolun and Zhangbei, what will we do?</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Wu Zhihui said, "The violent invasion of China by Japan is a pre-determined plan for the whole country. It will not be softened by our concession, or hardened by our resistance. We only need to resist desperately, regardless of life and death. If we win, the nation-state will survive and stand, and the glory of the whole people will remain. If we lose, the national personality and spirit will still be awe-inspiring, and recovery will be easier. What other countries are superior to us is material. At the juncture of national survival, the fundamental countermeasure lies in the material construction on which the people's livelihood depends, and in increasing the fact that the Communist Party is a bandit group that must be wiped out. Finally, he said that Chen Duxiu is not worthy of being a Communist Party member (Special Telegram, 28th).</p>

<h3 id="e52">Shao Hongji Returned to Beijing Yesterday <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shao Hongji, the Supervisory Committee member who investigated the case of Tang Yulin's abandonment of his post and absconding, returned to Beijing from Peiping on the morning of the 28th. According to reports, as a result of conducting investigations in Peiping and Tianjin and inquiring about the people who fled back to Peiping and Tianjin from Rehe, the reasons why Tang was unable to defend the territory were: 1. He levied exorbitant taxes on the people and forced them to plant opium, collecting more than 20 yuan per mu, causing deep resentment among the people. 2. He deducted military pay from the troops under his command. Tang had been in Rehe for seven years, and owed the various troops as much as thirteen or fourteen months to more than two years of military pay, causing the soldiers to lose their fighting spirit. 3. He advocated the establishment of the Xingye Bank and issued banknotes indiscriminately, absorbing cash. There was very little cash on the market. Every silver dollar could be exchanged for 50 to 80 paper dollars, causing the economy and finance of the society to be completely bankrupt. The soldiers and civilians all turned away from him. Therefore, the anti-Japanese troops did not listen to orders this time and retreated step by step. The people also did not provide any assistance. Tang's troops had to collect food before fighting. Because military pay had been owed for a long time, they searched for food from the people wherever they went. The troops in the Beipiao area retreated before the battle. The soldiers in Chaoyang, Lingyuan, and Chengde retreated automatically after hearing the news. The Japanese troops occupied various places even faster than Tang's troops retreated. As a result, 128 Japanese troops occupied the provincial capital of Chengde. Before Chengde was lost, Zhang Xueliang telegraphed an order to counterattack, but Tang had already fled west to a place 50 li outside of Rehe. The old troops sent a letter to Tang, and he returned to Chengde. After staying in Chengde for a day and a night, Tang fled Chengde again after hearing that the front line was in urgent condition. The Japanese army then sent planes to chase after him to investigate the truth. When Tang saw the Japanese planes coming, he fled even faster, abandoning the front-line troops and ignoring them. The facts are like this. He will report the facts to the Military Affairs Commission and forward them to the two Yuans and then to the National Government. As for how to deal with it, it is up to the National Government to review and decide (Special Telegram, 28th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shao Hongji, who went north with Fang Benren to investigate the Tang case thoroughly, has completed his investigation. Shao returned to Beijing on the morning of the 28th. According to reports, Tang Yulin deserved to be punished for losing Rehe. The thorough investigation has now been completed, and he will draft a report and submit it to the National Government. As for how to punish him, it should be decided by the government (Central News Agency, 28th).</p>
<p>(Peiping) This afternoon, Feng Qin-san was holding a birthday celebration for his mother at Zengshou Hall in Shique Hutong, Beixinqiao, when it was surrounded by military police. More than 20 guests and hosts were arrested. According to the Chief of Special Affairs of the Military Police, Feng and others are traitors who have held meetings repeatedly to plot wrongdoing. They have now gathered their cronies to discuss matters, so they were arrested (Special Telegram, 28th).</p>

<p>▲ Berlin Dispatch, 27th (Reuters) The leader of the German Steel Helmet Group and Minister of Labor, Mr. Seldte, announced in a radio broadcast today that he personally and the entire Steel Helmet Group have joined the National Socialist Party and are under the command of Hitler. Those who do not wish to follow will be released from their oath of membership in the Steel Helmet Group. This move was expected, as the Steel Helmet Group has recently purged opposition members within the party. Key figures in the group, such as Duesterberg and Wagner, were dismissed yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin Dispatch, 28th (Havas) The Minister of Economy and leader of the German National People's Party, Mr. Hugenberg, declared to the House of Representatives that the National People's Party is united with the National Socialist Party to strive for the future of Germany. The German people should know that the National People's Party and the National Socialist Party are of equal value. This statement did not cause any impression in political circles. The public believes that after the Steel Helmet Group joined the National Socialist Party, the influence of the National People's Party has been reduced.</p>

<p>▲ Washington Dispatch, 27th (National News Agency) After the President of the Philippine Senate, Mr. Quezon, announced his imminent return to the Philippines, several members of the US Congress stated today that they now believe that the Philippine Legislative Assembly will propose accepting the independence bill with several reservations. Quezon had proposed amending the original bill to members of the US Congress. Now that he has failed to obtain the US Congress's guarantee to make amendments, it is expected that Quezon will advocate partial acceptance. However, this action is actually equivalent to rejection, as the US Congress currently has no intention of further discussing the issue of Philippine independence.</p>

<p>Saying that Tokyo Will Sink to the Bottom of the Sea</p>
<p>Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun reported on the 21st that since Mr. Miyabe Naoshio, a technician at the Earthquake Research Institute of the Imperial University, published the startling news that (the Fukagawa Honjo area has sunk one foot in two years), it has caused a great shock in society. Unexpectedly, on the 18th, Mr. Miyabe again announced at a discussion meeting at the Earthquake Research Institute that the areas of Asakusa, Shitaya, Kanda, Nihonbashi, Kyobashi, Kojimachi, and Hongo will also sink two meters or fifteen shaku in the latest two years. This factual opinion caused a very great shock in academic circles. According to Mr. Miyabe's research, it is based on the level survey data from the Road Construction Division of the Tokyo Municipal Civil Engineering Bureau, which was investigated in all aspects of Tokyo City. It is based on the fact that the benchmark levels in the above-mentioned districts have shown a downward trend from the autumn of Showa 5 to the autumn of Showa 7 for two years. Among them, the Senju and Marunouchi areas are the most obvious, with Yurakucho sinking five inches. The lowest land in Tokyo City is the Honjo Fukagawa area. These two districts are two meters above sea level. The Nihonbashi and Kyobashi areas, which are relatively high, are about four to five meters. However, according to the progress of the situation, it has gradually subsided. In the future, all buildings will eventually sink to the bottom of the sea. Currently, all Tokyo residents are unusually terrified of Mr. Miyabe's announcement.</p>

<p>What Japan Fears Most Is China's Upward Development, and at the Same Time, It Tries Its Best to Prevent the Development of China's National Strength. Therefore, It Exerts Every Effort in the Northeast to Hold onto the South Manchurian Railway and Obstruct the Development of China's Economy in Many Ways, Especially the Development of Transportation. It Also Resents That the Soviet Union Has the Chinese Eastern Railway in Northern Manchuria. If That Railway Were Purely a Capitalist Enterprise, It Would Already Be Enough to Threaten the South Manchurian Railway and Enough to Subdue Korea. Moreover, It Bears a Very Obvious Socialist Nature. The Soviet Union Is Advancing Vigorously on the Road to Socialism. Even Though It Is Not Yet Harmful at Present, in the Future, the Countries Suffering in the West Will Probably Be Germany, and in the East, It Will Probably Be the Three Eastern Provinces and Korea. Then Japan Cannot Escape Extremely Serious Impact. Therefore, It Holds Great Fear of the Soviet Union and Great Fear of China. Thus, It Plans Day and Night to Annex (Manchuria) Under Pretext. On the Night of September 18th of the Year Before Last, It Created a Trap, Used Military Force to Occupy the Three Eastern Provinces, and Arbitrarily Created a Puppet to Obey the Domination of Japanese Imperialism. This Can Both Deceive Capitalist Countries by Saying It Is to Prevent (Communization) and Tell Its People That It Is Opening up Territory and Breaking Through Japan's Economic Difficulties. Among These Matters, One Main Thing Is Worth Our Attention: Japan, Having Forcibly Occupied the Three Eastern Provinces, Has Placed All the Railways Under the Control of the South Manchurian Railway, Using the South Manchurian Railway to Compete with the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, the South Manchurian Railway Cannot Absorb the Goods of Northern Manchuria, and at the Same Time, Most of Jilin's Products Are Still Absorbed by the Chinese Eastern Railway. Therefore, Its Countermeasure Is to Quickly Complete the Jihui Railway. The Jihui Railway, in Economic Terms, Traverses Two Parts of Jilin and Is Almost Parallel to the Chinese Eastern Railway. If the Railways from Yanji to Hailin and from Hailin to Sanxing Succeed, Then the Control of the Entire Jilin Province Will Be Entirely in the Hands of These Two Intersecting Railways. Although the Chinese Eastern Railway Can Be Considered Advanced, the Port of Vladivostok Is Far Less Strategic Than Xiongzhi and Less Advantageous Than Chongjin. Therefore, Since Japan Obtained the Northeast, and When It Launched the Mukden Incident, It Simultaneously Attacked Jilin. Its Most Obvious Attempt Was to Hold the Jidun Railway, From Dunhua to Huining, Entirely Under Japanese Domination. At That Time, No Matter What Methods China Used to Resolve the Problem of the Three Eastern Provinces, It Still Managed to Seize the Rights to the Jihui Railway.</p>
<p>Therefore, After Occupying the Northeast, It Immediately Began to Build the Railway from Dunhua to Yanji and from Yanji to Huimudong, with the Railway from Xiongzhi, Korea, to Nanyang Station Being Separated by Only One River, the Tumen River. The So-Called Duntou Railway Track Extends a Total of 190 Kilometers, Plus the 210 Kilometers of the Jidun Railway and the 127 Kilometers of the Jichang Railway, for a Total of 527 Kilometers from Changchun to Huimudong. According to the Plan Set by the South Manchurian Railway, It Plans to Begin Provisional Operations at the End of May. After the Tumen River Bridge Is Built, It Will Officially Open to Traffic with Huining.</p>
<p>Now, the Entire Line of Tracks Has Been Laid, and the Trial Run Ceremony Was Held on the 20th of This Month. On the Japanese Side, of Course, They Are Celebrating Their Success in Aggression and Celebrating the Strength of Their Tools. However, as We Live in a Foreign Land and Look at the Mountains and Rivers, Seeing the Joy of Others, We Truly Have Tears But No Place to Shed Them.</p>
<p>Amidst Such Extreme Grief, What Barely Relieves Us Is That on the 20th, Precisely When They Were Holding Their Arrogant Trial Run, the Rail Spikes at Erdaogou Station Were Pulled Out, and the Train Derailed and Overturned. Several Hundred People with Complete Firearms Ran Out of the Deep Forest, Shouting Loudly That All Chinese People Should Stand Out. After They Examined Them and Confirmed That They Were Chinese, They Were All Released. The Japanese, One by One, Became Ghosts Under the Bayonets. In Total, More Than Thirty Were Killed. Thus, a Grand Event Encountered Such a Blood Sacrifice. What Was Most Gratifying Was That Several Japanese Officials of the Puppet State, Who Were Ostentatiously Going to Participate in the Ceremony, Also Became Ghosts at the Same Time. When the Japanese Troops Stationed in Jilin Received This News, They Hastily Sent Armored Cars and Cannons in a Large Force to Erdaogou. However, the Team There Had Already Been Victorious and Left. However, the Chinese and Koreans of Erdaogou Will Suffer Another Disaster and Be Trampled by the Japanese Army. However, They Are Not Discouraged by This and Are Still Preparing to Wait for the Righteous</p>

<h3 id="e115">Japanese Troops Retreat to Various Passes of the Great Wall <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Our Troops Advance on All Fronts</p>
<p>Various Generals Meet Again in Beiping for Discussion</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since the 22nd, the Japanese troops in Luandong suddenly abandoned Qian'an, Lulong, and Jianchangying and retreated towards Lengkou. The puppet troops in the Changli area also seemed to be retreating eastwards. On the 22nd and 23rd, the Japanese troops at Xifengkou also withdrew from Sahaqiao and Luanyangcheng and moved towards Koumen and the Great Wall area. The Japanese troops at Gubeikou, since the 25th, have stopped their fierce attacks on our troops. After Shang Zhen's troops recovered Qian'an, they continued to pursue. The vanguard troops reached Jianchangying on the 25th and continued to advance towards Lengkou on the 26th. Wang Jun's troops, who recovered Lulong, have also reached the Liujiakou-Beining railway line. On the 24th, they recovered Anshan. On the 25th, they repaired the railway destroyed at Shimen, Changli. The armored train "Henan" arrived near Changli. There was a saying on the morning of the 26th that Changli had been recovered. After the Japanese troops at Xifengkou retreated north, a part of our troops advanced from the East and West Changyu. On the 25th, they recovered places such as Sahaqiao and Luanyangcheng. Currently, a part of the Japanese troops in that area is still holding the line of the Great Wall. Before our troops understand the true situation of the Japanese troops, they are temporarily confronting each other without actively pursuing them. Therefore, the Japanese troops at Beikou fiercely attacked our Nantianmen position for four days and nights but failed. According to a military agency announcement, the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties in this attack on Nantianmen and Badaolouzi, with over 2,000 officers and soldiers killed and over 3,000 wounded, marking a major loss for the Japanese army since the invasion of Rehe. Since the 25th, there have been no fierce battles in that area. Badaolouzi was recovered on the night of the 25th. On the morning of the 26th, there was only artillery fire. The Japanese and puppet infantry did not move out. Overall, the war on the entire front has been relatively quiet. It is said that the reasons for the Japanese army's retreat this time can be attributed to three factors: (1) The Washington Conference is about to open, and the British and French prime ministers have already arrived in the United States. Britain and France are becoming increasingly close to the United States. Japan's international relations are deteriorating. Although the Washington Conference is to discuss world economic problems, all countries believe that Japan's invasion of our Three Eastern Provinces, the occupation of Rehe, the expansion of military affairs, and the destruction of peace in East Asia have a direct impact on the decline of the world economy. Therefore, discussing economic issues will inevitably involve the Sino-Japanese issue and seek ways to sanction it. The direct talks between Britain, the United States, and other countries regarding their own interests are more powerful than the empty League of Nations meetings. Japan will not treat the Washington Conference in the same way as it treats the League of Nations. Therefore, it is implementing the withdrawal of troops that have invaded the Guannei area to show that it is fulfilling its repeated statements of ensuring no expansion of military affairs within the Guannei area along the Great Wall. (2) The Sino-Russian negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway are deteriorating. It is said that both sides are actively preparing for war. Soviet Russia is currently increasing its troop strength by twelve divisions in Vladivostok, Bo Li, Chita, and Amur, and mobilizing over 300 aircraft. The Japanese side is also newly transferring a division from the country to the Three Eastern Provinces. Many military supplies are being transported to northern Manchuria. Tensions are high, and war could break out at any moment. The Japanese army is retreating its troops due to the tense situation in northern Manchuria to transfer troops to defend against Russia. (3) The Japanese army is changing its strategy of invading our country, transferring the troops from Luandong and Xifengkou to Gubeikou, concentrating its forces, attacking Miyun, Yutian, and Sanhe to the south, threatening Beiping and Tianjin, and disrupting the rear of our army to achieve a quick effect of invasion.</p>
<p>After the troops stationed in the eastern sector retreated to the west bank of the Luan River, our military authorities summoned various generals to Beiping to discuss defense strategies. At that time, they agreed to reorganize the defense line and fight to the end. All front-line troops have been re-equipped according to the established plan. Currently, with the retreat of the Japanese army and changes in the situation, all plans have to be changed accordingly. He Yingqin has specially telegraphed to summon various generals to Beiping again for long-term discussion. Shang Zhen, Yuan, Pang Bingxun, Fu Zuoyi, etc., arrived in Beiping one after another on the evening of the 25th. Yu Xuezhong also rushed to arrive on the morning of the 26th. On the evening of the 25th, Shang Song, Pang Fu, etc., held detailed discussions with He Yingqin at Jurentang until late at night before dispersing. At 10:00 AM on the 26th, the Military Council held its fifth regular meeting. He Yingqin, Jiang Bocheng, Rong Zhen, Wan Fulin, Xu Yongchang, and over twenty generals, including Shang Song, Yu Pang, and Fu, attended. He Yingqin presided over the meeting. During the meeting, various generals reported on the situation at the front. There was a long discussion on the countermeasures to be taken after the retreat of the Japanese army. Everyone agreed that the Japanese army's withdrawal this time was a planned retreat, and our army should still adhere to the predetermined plan for offense and defense and advance according to the situation. The meeting dispersed at about 12:00 noon. According to Song Zheyuan, the enemy on the Xifengkou front retreated successively on the 22nd and 23rd. Before leaving, they still used artillery to bombard our positions fiercely. A part of our troops tracked and advanced from the East and West Changyu and occupied places such as Sahaqiao and Luanyangcheng. The enemy is currently still holding the line of the Great Wall and is in confrontation with our army. On the night of the 24th, the enemy drove twenty cars and five tanks from outside the pass to Koucheng. They were not seen advancing, and it seemed to be a night shift change. Japanese aircraft often bombed within the pass. On the 24th, three Japanese aircraft came to Santunying to drop bombs. The houses there were almost completely destroyed by the bombing. The bombs they dropped weighed over 700 pounds and had both explosive and incendiary properties. Most of the civilian houses that were not bombed were also burned down. The situation was extremely tragic. Each bomb could blast two zhang deep and fifteen or sixteen zhang wide, with great power. This time, I brought back a bomb to Beiping, which can be viewed. The bomb is about three or four chi high and did not explode when it landed, etc. (26th)</p>

<p>Appointed by Chiang Kai-shek as the Commander-in-Chief for the Suppression of Bandits in Western Hubei</p>
<p>Military Conference in Shashi Decides on Strategy for Advance and Suppression</p>
<p>Correspondence from Hankou: The communist bandit He Long previously fled from Shaanxi and returned to western Hubei, entrenched in the old nest of Five Cranes, remotely supporting Xu Xiangqian. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek once sent Fan Xiji, the director of the provincial security office, to lead troops to suppress him, penetrating deep into Enshi County. However, due to the steep mountain paths and dense forests, not only was it difficult to march, but it was also inconvenient to transport grain. They held each other in a stalemate, forming a situation of being trapped. Moreover, the command of the Hunan-Hubei joint suppression was not unified. Therefore, on the 26th, Chiang telegraphed to authorize Xu Yuanquan, the commissioner for clearing the countryside in Hubei Province, to concurrently serve as the commander-in-chief for the suppression of bandits in western Hubei. All of Zhang Gang's security team, Jiang Zuojun's New Third Brigade, and Li Guojun's brigade of the Sixty-second Division, commanded by Liu Jianxu of the Hunan Army, as well as Long Renfa's First Detachment, jointly organized by Shi and Li counties, and Zhou Bianqing's brigade of the New Thirty-fourth Division, were placed under his command and dispatch to unify authority. After Xu took office, he immediately returned to Shashi on a plane. On the 27th, he convened a military conference in Shashi, gathering division commander Zhang Zhenhan and brigade commanders Huang Xin, Shan Zhai, and Jiang Zuojun to decide on the strategy for advance and suppression. Xu will go to the front line to inspect within the next few days and telegraphed to order the Hunan Army to suppress by a fixed date. The headquarters, it is heard, will be set up in Shashi and will be moved to the front line if necessary.</p>
<p>Bandit alarms have recently occurred in Huangma and other counties in eastern Hubei. The bandit forces in Macheng are particularly rampant. According to an urgent telegram from Zheng Zhong, the county magistrate of the county, the bandits have gathered tens of thousands of people, and the county seat is in imminent danger. It is said that the bandits in Huang'an have been repelled by Wan Yaohuang's Thirteenth Division. Wan's troops also suffered some losses. The counties in southern Henan adjacent to Huangma also reported alarms at the same time. Wei Lihuang, the commander-in-chief for clearing and suppressing bandits in eastern Hubei, has also recently been ordered by Chiang to concurrently serve as the commander-in-chief for the suppression of bandits in the border areas of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. He has designated the troops under his jurisdiction to be responsible for supervising and suppressing them. Wei has decided to take office on the first of next month. The headquarters will be set up in Kouhe. (April 27th)</p>

<p>Tian Songyao Recovers Nanjiang and Bazhong</p>
<p>Overview of the Internal Organization of the Bandit Gangs</p>
<p>The People Request Exemption from the Expenses for Suppressing the Communists</p>
<p>Correspondence from Chongqing: Since the communist bandits Xu Xiangqian and Kuang Jixun fled into Sichuan, the three counties of Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong in northern Sichuan have fallen one after another. The bandit gangs then renamed Tongjiang as Chijiang County and Nanjiang as Hongjiang County, and established county-level Soviet puppet governments, putting forward slogans such as expanding the 100,000-strong Red Army organization, concentrating 10,000 shi of grain, and developing the communist zone on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi. They also recruited young workers and peasants into the gangs and newly formed them into guerrilla teams, Red Guards, etc., in an attempt to expand their forces. They also established a puppet Sichuan-Shaanxi provincial Soviet government in the Sichuan-Shaanxi border area. In Tongjiang, they also ran the Yang Peng Military School, and the cadre talents were all trained by the school. Internally, the bandits are divided into various factions. Zhang Guotao, Xu Xiangqian, etc., are the cadre faction among the bandits. After they entered Sichuan, they carried out plans to purge and reorganize the Reform Faction, the Third Party, the AB Corps, and the Cancellation Faction. They especially hated the Reform Faction, calling it the "Reform-Sending Faction." Currently, Nanjiang and Bazhong counties have been recovered by Tian Songyao's troops. Although the bandits are holding out in Tongjiang, they lack funds and ammunition, and their internal organization is disintegrating. The time for their annihilation should not be far away.</p>
<p>The organization of the bandits hiding in Sichuan is very strict. It is said that Zhang Guotao is the chairman of the puppet Chinese Soviet Republic and the Northwest Revolutionary Military Commission of the Communist Party. Zhuan Zhong is the puppet director of the General Political Department. Xu Xiangqian is the commander-in-chief of the puppet Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Fourth Front Army. Chen Changhao is the puppet political commissar of the General Political Committee. Zhang Qinqiu (female) is the puppet director of the General Political Department and secretary of the North Sichuan Special Committee. Wang Hongkun is the puppet commander of the Tenth Division of the Fourth Army. The commander of the puppet Eleventh Division of the Fourth Army is unknown. He Wei is the puppet commander of the Twelfth Division of the Fourth Army and the commander of the Forward Command. Zhan Caifang is the puppet political commissar. The commander of the puppet Twenty-seventh Division of the Ninth Army is unknown. The commander of the puppet Twenty-fifth Division of the Ninth Army is unknown. Wang Shusheng is the puppet commander of the Seventy-third Division of the Twenty-fifth Army. Wu Weizhang is the puppet commander of the Independent First Division (this division was newly formed after the communist bandits entered Sichuan. Because he was suspected, the bandit general Wu shot himself). Qi Zhenbang is the puppet commander of the North Sichuan Guerrilla.</p>
<p>Kuang Jixun was originally an important member of the bandits, previously serving as the commander-in-chief of a certain army. This time, his status declined when he came to Sichuan. He once served as a member of the Nanjiang County Soviet. Recently, he has been detained on suspicion of something.</p>
<p>Tian Songyao of the Twenty-ninth Army, after recovering Nanjiang and Bazhong, ordered the troops on the front line to stop advancing and rest. However, Tian has recently ordered a large-scale collection of expenses for suppressing the communists, stipulating 300,000 for large counties, 200,000 for medium counties, and 120,000 for small counties. The funds are to be advanced by wealthy gentlemen and must be paid by the end of this month. It is estimated that over 10 million yuan can be raised. However, the military expenses borne by the area garrisoned by Tian's army are the heaviest compared to any military area. The people are already unable to bear it. Based on monthly installments, the people must pay twelve years of grain tax annually. Based on this calculation, taxes will be pre-levied until after the year 120 of the Republic. With this order issued, the people of various counties are pleading with Tian to reduce or exempt them, but Tian is determined to implement it. Therefore, throughout Sichuan, only the sound of tax collection is heard, which is enough to show the suffering of the people. (April 27th)</p>

<p>Correspondence from Jinan: Shao Hongji, a member of the Control Yuan, and Fang Benren, a general counselor of the Military Senate, were previously ordered to go to Beiping together to investigate the Tang Yulin case and the Tianjin Naval Hospital case. Shao also inspected Hebei's politics. The official business has been completed. Except for Fang Benren, who has already taken the Pinghan train from Beiping to Hankou to transfer to Jiangxi to report to Chiang Kai-shek, Shao Hongji took the Pingpu No. 201 train back to Nanjing to report to the Control Yuan. This morning (the 27th) at 9:30, the train passed Jinan. The reporter boarded the train to interview him and asked about the investigation of the Tang case, the Naval Hospital case, and the inspection of the political situation in Hebei. Shao talked about the process in detail for ten minutes. The following is a record of the conversation:</p>

<p>Shao said, regarding the Tang Yulin case, the actual situation has been clarified. Politically, Tang served as the chairman of Rehe for seven years, imposing various taxes and levies, with heavy exploitation, and the people lived in misery. The biggest one was forcing people to plant opium in order to collect taxes and enrich his own pockets. He founded the Xingye Bank and issued banknotes indiscriminately, absorbing cash. Therefore, Rehe has been impoverished for seven years. Other misdeeds are innumerable and can be completely covered by the word "bad." Militarily, in total, Tang owed thirty-nine months of pay during his seven years in Rehe. The pay was also issued in Xingye Bank banknotes. Initially, twenty-five yuan could be exchanged for one silver dollar, but later it got worse and worse. Fifty yuan could only be exchanged for one silver dollar. The soldiers got it but it was useless, so there were complaints everywhere. He also levied supplies locally, and the people were restless. The people hated him to the bone. When war broke out, the troops fled before fighting, and Rehe was lost. In terms of the above two matters, Tang's death is not enough to atone for his crimes. The facts are there, and there is no need to go to Rehe for further investigation. The Tang case was originally investigated jointly by the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission, so the simple and actual situation has been jointly presented to the central government for punishment. After I return to Nanjing, I will make a personal report. Before the central government decides on a plan, I cannot express my opinion. Currently, Tang's troops only have five or six thousand people left. He has also incorporated righteous volunteers and bandits, totaling over ten thousand people, in the Guyuan area. Tang Yulin himself is said to be hiding with Sun Dianying.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Tianjin Naval Hospital Case <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The case of Zhang Xueliang selling the Tianjin Naval Hospital has been reported in many newspapers. I also investigated this case during this trip to the north. In Tianjin, I consulted the files of the entire case and learned that this case has been handled for more than a year. Before Zhang Xueliang left, he sent Tianjin Mayor Zhou Longguang to represent the Military Affairs Commission Branch in Beiping, on the order of the former Military Affairs Commission Branch in Beiping, and signed an agreement with the French on February 8th. It was not a sale, nor was any money obtained. The naval hospital is located in the French Concession, Kunlian, covering an area of thirty-nine mu. The French have repeatedly negotiated over the years to open a road in the middle, which would require occupying seven mu of land. According to Zhang Zixiang, the president of the hospital, the hospital's affiliated school has only received 3,000 yuan in funding since 1927. The amount owed to French professors and doctors has accumulated to 90,000 yuan. Also, after the Boxer Rebellion in the late Qing Dynasty, a French merchant ship went to our Dagu port and wanted to enter our shipyard for repairs, but was burned before entering the factory. According to reason, our country should not have compensated, but because the French businessman was able to influence the current French consul, he requested that if the naval hospital case were resolved, he would also be compensated for his losses of 60,000 yuan. This clause should have been rejected, but this agreement actually allowed it. The agreement has been signed. The content is roughly that the seven mu of land occupied by the road cannot be priced, but the land there is worth 20,000 yuan per mu. Our country has a loss of 140,000. The salaries of the French professors and doctors are 90,000 yuan, which must be offset by more than four mu of land. The price of the French merchant ship is 60,000, which must also be offset by three mu of land (all priced at 20,000 yuan per mu). Although the agreement has not yet been implemented, the land is still managed by China. However, since the agreement has been signed, implementation is only a matter of time. In terms of responsibility, Zhang Xueliang, as the acting chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Branch in Beiping, had no right to represent the government to dispose of national public property. Moreover, not only French people were professors and doctors in the hospital and school, but also many Chinese people. If the outstanding salaries were paid based on the price of the land, the Chinese should also have a share, but it was not mentioned. The French ship that was burned should not have been compensated, but it was compensated. All of this means a loss of rights. The Control Yuan had already filed an impeachment against this, but at that time, the detailed situation was not yet clear. Although the investigation has now been clarified, the land is adjacent to the French Concession, and handling it is very difficult.</p>

<p>Shao also said, I also investigated the political situation in Hebei on this trip north. There used to be exorbitant taxes and levies, and there was really nothing good to say. Each bag of salt had to pay more than four yuan in additional taxes, and the mining tax was also very heavy, which hindered development. After Yu Xiaohou (Xuezhong) took office as chairman, he knew to make great efforts to reform, but during Zhang Xueliang's era, there were still things that he could not control. I met with Yu several times in Tianjin and learned that Yu is making efforts to reform politics, reduce the burden on the people, and has made much more progress than before. (27th)</p>

<p>Defense Donation Collection Standards</p>
<p>Since the county defense corps began universal training, it is about to be completed. The expenses required for running special training classes, preparing uniforms, and printing materials have been very large. In the future, it will still be necessary to purchase firearms, all of which require funds. The county defense committee, after deliberation, decided to collect defense donations from April 1st, once every three months, collected by each district office together with each branch station according to household. The collection standards have been approved by provincial order. Those with property of 100,000 yuan or more will pay 1.4 per mille annually, those with 40,000 to 50,000 yuan will pay 1.3 per mille, those with 10,000 yuan or more will pay 1.2 per mille, those with 5,000 yuan or more will pay 1.1 per mille, and those with 1,000 yuan or more will pay 1 per mille. It has been circulated to various districts and announced for general knowledge to facilitate the progress of donation work.</p>

<p>For the convenience of collecting taxes from various counties along Taihu Lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the Fisheries Development Fee Collection Office of the Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry established the Lake Taihu Suzhou Area Collection Branch outside Changmen, Wuxian County. The jurisdiction of the branch covers Wuxing, Changxing, Sian, Guangde, etc. in Zhejiang Province, and Wuxian, Wujiang, Wuxi, Liyang, Taicang, Xuanxing, etc. in Jiangsu Province. Liu Tong, a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang, has been appointed as the director and has already begun collecting taxes. The tax rate is set at 1%, collected by each fish trade on behalf of the government. The Wuxian Fresh Fish Industry Association stated that the fishermen are poor and cannot even make ends meet, so how can they afford to pay fees? They presented four reasons for not being able to collect on behalf of the government and sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce yesterday (28th) to forward to the collection office to request exemption from collection.</p>

<p>Tongde Rice Store Closes Due to Losses</p>
<p>The Tongde Rice Store, located inside the Zhalikou outside the North Gate, was established by local residents Zhou Linchu and Gong Fanwo with pooled funds in the twenty-first year of the Guangxu reign. Since its opening, it had been quite prosperous. Every year-end, the profits were substantial, so the turnover was exceptionally flexible. They also opened a rice mill, which was also doing quite well. Zhou Linchu also engaged in gold trading, earning as much as fifty to sixty thousand yuan before the Qi-Lu War. He then leased land from the Xiansheng Temple (the land was in Xinbei Zhalikou) and built more than twenty market houses. In addition to using two market houses for his own use to open the new Tongde Rice Store, the remaining market houses were rented out. Unexpectedly, less than a year after the store opened, Zhou Linchu again traded in gold, losing sixty to seventy thousand yuan, which caused the turnover to become sluggish. He then sold the new Tongde Rice Store, together with the rented market houses, to Huayi Company in Tangkou for about sixty thousand yuan, in order to make up for the losses, allowing the old store to continue operating. Zhou Linchu died of illness the year before last, and his son Zhihe became the manager. Last spring, Zhihe saw that the price of rice in the local area was soaring and the profits were minimal, so he purchased a large amount of Saigon rice and Xiaojiao rice. However, after the purchase, the price of rice gradually fell, resulting in another loss of sixty to seventy thousand yuan. In addition, the outstanding accounts also amounted to fifty to sixty thousand yuan. This year, due to the sharp drop in rice prices and sluggish business, the turnover became unsustainable, and the store announced its closure yesterday. The store manager, Zhou Zhihe, sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to clear the accounts.</p>

<p>The Ninth District Administrative Inspectorate previously captured and brought in bandits Wu Deyi, Wang Hongxuan, Huang Yikuan, and fugitive bandit Wu Xuebiao, among others, from the Jiangdu Police Team. After interrogation, it was confirmed that these bandits, on the night of November 30th, 21st year of the Republic, colluded to rob the home of Li Shaogan in Dongjia, Tingshou Township, and kidnapped the five-year-old child Zhou Bingling, extorting a monthly payment. Furthermore, on the nights of October 28th and November 29th of the same year, they robbed the home of Gao Di Shi in Cuizigou, Chenjiadian, Zhoushu Township, twice in succession, burning the victims. The victims were summoned to the case to testify and confirm the facts. The record was submitted to the provincial government for review. Yesterday, a telegram was received approving the death penalty. The bandits were taken out yesterday (the 27th) at 10 a.m., their identities were verified, and they were escorted to the execution ground in Huayousuo, east of the city, to be executed by firing squad.</p>

<p>Since various routes in eastern Hebei have been successively lost, the situation in Peiping and Tianjin has become increasingly tense. Universities in Peiping have had to temporarily suspend classes and prepare to relocate to a safer location. Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, Jiaotong University, etc., have all decided to move valuable books and instruments to a safe place for storage when necessary. It is learned that the books and instruments of Peking University have now been negotiated with Zhejiang University in Hangzhou and will be transported and stored in the school. Zhejiang University has agreed to temporarily borrow the remaining houses of the former biological laboratory of the school on Daoma Lane as a place to store these books and instruments. It is reported that the books and instruments transported by Peking University to Hangzhou this time total more than 500 volumes. Cai Zengrong has been assigned to escort the books and instruments and has set off from Peiping to the south. He is already halfway there. Peking University has also sent Shen Suwen, director of the General Affairs Division, to Hangzhou in advance to negotiate and take care of everything. Among the instruments, there is a wind and rain measuring instrument, which is very precious. There are only two such measuring instruments in the world, one in London and the other owned by the Physics Department of Peking University. As for whether the school will move south, it will depend on the situation of the war at the front.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Wang Jingwei's Explanation of Peace and War with Japan <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Because we cannot fight, we resist.</p>
<p>Because we cannot reconcile, we negotiate.</p>
<p>Therefore, resistance and negotiation go hand in hand.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government received a telegram from Nanjing yesterday regarding Premier Wang Jingwei's very detailed explanation of the issue of peace and war with Japan. The original telegram is reproduced below: Recently, some people have questioned the government's attitude towards coping with the national crisis, believing that if there is no reconciliation, there is war, and if there is no war, there is reconciliation. Such a situation of neither reconciliation nor war is a dead end. I believe that a simple explanation is necessary on this point. My explanation is very simple: Because we cannot fight, we resist. Because we cannot reconcile, we negotiate. The government's attitude towards coping with the national crisis is not neither reconciliation nor war, but resistance and negotiation going hand in hand. Now, let's first talk about why we resist because we cannot fight. Does China today have the conditions to declare war on Japan? Anyone with common sense can deny this, without needing much explanation. However, declaring war and resisting are different. Declaring war requires assessing one's strength, while resisting does not necessarily require assessing one's strength. When the enemy invades, we must exhaust all our material resources and all our spiritual abilities.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Thinking of Resistance <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Not only is it unnecessary to assess our strength, but it is also inappropriate to assess our strength. China today is indeed weak. More than nine-tenths of our monthly income is used for military expenses, but the soldiers at the front still lack food and ammunition. Not to mention all the other necessary military equipment. Poverty and weakness are undeniable. But if we truly think about what will happen after the country is lost, I'm afraid that the few guns and cannons we have now will also be gone. Wouldn't we want to recover at that time? If we don't have guns, we'll use bamboo poles. If we don't have cannons, we'll use stones. We'll have to risk our lives to seek recovery. Then, having a few guns and cannons now is much better than after the country is lost. Is it that we only want to resist now and only want to recover after the country is lost? The above is the resistance's</p>
<h3 id="e136">True Meaning <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Understanding this meaning, we must have the following two methods: First, we clench our teeth and do not complain. The government should not complain because it cannot raise funds or because its appeals are not answered. The people should not complain because they are impoverished and displaced. The soldiers should not complain because they are hungry and destitute and their needs are not met. Because China is a miserable China, and the Chinese are miserable Chinese. Misery is destined. We prepare to endure hardship and do not complain casually. Second, since we have the determination to clench our teeth and endure hardship, we must always think about it in our hearts and do it with our hands. But we must never shout out childish patriotic thoughts. We are afraid that others will not know that we love our country. Mature</p>
<p>patriotic thoughts, we are afraid that others will know that we love our country. Because in this</p>
<h3 id="e137">World of Power <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>a poor and weak country, constantly talking about patriotism, there is a danger of losing the country. So, if we don't love our country, then so be it. The first meaning of loving our country is to be silent. The era of pasting slogans and shouting slogans has passed and will never be needed again. Shouting about minor defeats as major victories, shouting about major defeats as minor victories, calling a loss of territory a strategic abandonment, and calling a retreat a change of position. This kind of war news is not only laughed at by the enemy, but also fuels the people's hypocritical and indolent patriotism. This kind of hypocritical and indolent patriotism makes the people easily excited by excessive expectations and then discouraged by excessive disappointments. This is especially unacceptable. The more silent we are, the more determined we are. The more sorrowful we are, the more courageous we are. The less we say with our mouths, the more we think in our hearts, and the more we do with our hands. This is the most important way for a miserable people to prepare for hardship. Our future is one of victory, but the future of victory is distant. We may have to go through</p>
<h3 id="e138">Many Failures <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Not resisting will certainly lose territory, and resisting will still lose territory. But losing territory through resistance is much stronger than losing territory without resistance. We only need to ask whether the resistance is exhaustive or not. We do not need to ask whether the resistance is effective or not. Because the failures of the present are the mother of future victories. The above is an explanation of the reason why we resist because we cannot fight. Now, let's talk about why we negotiate because we cannot reconcile. We must know that today's so-called reconciliation is just another name for humiliation. (Enduring humiliation to survive) The ancients had such a saying. But today, is it enduring humiliation to survive, or is it</p>
<h3 id="e139">Enduring Humiliation to Perish <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Now someone has said, instead of losing territory piece by piece, we should (cut off our hand when stung by a poisonous snake, as the ancients did). The ancients also had such a saying. But ultimately, is it cutting off the hand or cutting off the head? If it is only cutting off the hand, it can be said to be seeking survival. If it is cutting off the head, it is only seeking death. We must not only have the ambition of (preferring death to dishonor), but also know that since death is inevitable, it is better to die without dishonor than to die in dishonor. Now we must ask, if we sign a treaty recognizing the puppet government and ceding the three northeastern provinces and Jehol, is this cutting off the hand or cutting off the head? Some people may think that this is cutting off the hand. For example, recently, someone publicly telegraphed in Tianjin, saying that they want to leave</p>
<h3 id="e140">A Glimmer of Hope <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>for the people of Hebei. This is the argument for cutting off the hand. But I think this is not cutting off the hand, but cutting off the head. This is originally self-evident. Not only are those who encroach insatiable and not satisfied with just cutting off the hand, but also once this precedent is set, if this one cuts off the hand, then the next one will naturally have to cut off the hand as well. The result will not stop until the body is dismembered. Then, not only will the head be cut off, but the body will also be slowly sliced to pieces. Then, saying reconciliation is not only another name for humiliation, but also another name for death. We must not only have the ambition of preferring death to dishonor, but also know that since death is inevitable, it is better to die without dishonor than to die in dishonor. Then why do we still talk about negotiation? I think that some people have sometimes excessive expectations and sometimes excessive disappointments regarding negotiation. I often hear people say that China should enter the European war like Belgium. But what does China have to compare with Belgium? When Belgium</p>
<h3 id="e141">Resisted Germany <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Russia and France had already started the war with Germany. Britain followed suit and also started the war with Germany. Although Japan today has lost the moral sympathy in the international arena, its military and economic strength is still sufficient to act without morality. Although China has gained moral sympathy in the international arena, it is poor and weak and has not received any assistance. For an isolated China to support an isolated Japan, and yet want to compare itself to Belgium, what excessive expectations are these? However, on the other hand, to despise the moral sympathy in the international arena and think that it has no value is that excessive disappointment often coincides with the former. We must know that in the League of Nations treaty, each member state agreed to respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity and agreed to replace war with various peaceful means. This has a great deal to do with world peace. In the past, barbaric</p>
<h3 id="e142">Savage Methods <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>such as the partition of Poland by Russia, Prussia, and Austria, cannot be used again today. For those who violate the covenant, although they cannot be subjected to economic or military sanctions in a given situation, the moral sanctions have already declared them to be committing a great crime against the world. On the one hand, this is the end result of the member states advocating justice, and on the other hand, it cannot be said that it is the result of our country's unyielding efforts since the September 18th Incident. Therefore, excessive disappointment is unjustified. As for Japan, there is currently no negotiation to speak of, but there will eventually be a day of negotiation in the future. How will it be? Will Japan eventually return to the League of Nations and follow its decisions, or will Japan resolutely abandon its past policy of aggression and automatically move towards a path of co-existence between China and Japan, or will there be other ways? No matter what the way, all we can say is that from</p>
<h3 id="e143">National Dignity <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>to establish a minimum limit. Within the minimum limit, we will not hesitate to compromise and seek completeness. Beyond the minimum limit, we will only prefer death to dishonor. This is the fundamental meaning of negotiation. In short, if it is harmful to the national dignity of China, we will not only not be subdued by Japan alone, but even if all countries unite to force China, we will not be subdued. What I mean by negotiation and resistance going hand in hand is roughly like this. This is an old saying that I have said many times before. However, what I say today is still only this old saying.</p>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Chinese citizens in Mexico were unreasonably expelled back to China due to the oppression of the anti-Chinese party. One part of more than one hundred and forty people took the American President Monroe back to China on the twelfth of this month. One hundred and seventy-eight people will take the President Lincoln back to China this time. The ship will arrive at Shanghai at 8 AM. The global Chinese Overseas Chinese Association dispatched multiple officials to take care of the situation. Fifteen cars were prepared to welcome people at the Shanghai Customs. The Chinese were treated to refreshments at the global Chinese Overseas Chinese Association on Guizhou Road Number 128. Continental Newspaper dispatched a reporter to photograph the displaced Overseas Chinese. The Overseas Chinese people are Cantonese people. Most of these people come from Zhongshan, Nanhai, and Jiujiang. Most of the Chinese have relatives, children, and are in a cold and bitter situation. The Xin Xin News Agency reporter met with the leader of the displaced overseas Chinese, Li Kuan, at the Overseas Chinese Association to talk about the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Causes of Anti-Chinese Sentiment <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>60-70 thousand Mexican workers migrated to America. The number of unemployed workers increased as a result of the global recession. For this reason, the Chinese living in Mexico were unable to establish themselves in Mexico. Consequently, they were forced to return to Mexico to search for a living. However, most of the small and mid-sized businesses were run by Overseas Chinese, which caused envy and antagonism. Therefore, an anti-Chinese organization was formed. The organization's base of operations was Shunshan Province. The authorities in this Province did not interfere and secretly aided in the movement. Furthermore, Japanese citizens secretly instigated the anti-Chinese movement by order of the Japanese government. All of the Chinese stores in Shunshan Province were robbed clean. After the robbing the Chinese people were imprisoned and deported. The anti-Chinese party mistreated the Overseas Chinese without limits. This is one of the main reasons for the anti-Chinese movement. The mental and financial hardship of the Overseas Chinese is hard to put into words. In order to avoid further mistreatment, the Chinese abandoned everything in Mexico and illegally crossed into America. The American government arrested these people and sent them back to China. We know that illegal immigration is against immigration law. Therefore, we do not blame the American government for detaining us. The American authorities knew that we were stealing into America to escape from hardship. Therefore, the government provided all travel expenses to return home. We are extremely thankful. One hundred and seventy-eight people were sent home this time. More than forty were children. More than two hundred and fifty people are being detained and are awaiting a ship to return home.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Blessings on the Way <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The American authorities used the train to escort the Overseas Chinese from Mishijia Port to Jinshan. The Chinese Association sent people to visit and gave $1.50 (7 Chinese yuan) to each person. When the boat arrived at Honolulu, the natives gave five dollars to each person because the displaced overseas Chinese have no clothes or luggage.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Petitioning <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Li said that the government is turning a deaf ear to all of the suffering that we have endured. Not only is there no financial assistance when we arrive in Shanghai, but there is no one who offers sympathy. The authorities are clearly discriminating. In order to save ourselves, we plan on sending a petition to Beijing, but calling everyone together is difficult because we have no money. I will wait until I return to Guangdong to decide.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Visiting Mayor Wu <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu is an elder in the overseas Chinese community and spares no effort to protect overseas Chinese. We heard about his reputation. We will send Feng Huaxi, Wu Sheng, Chen Lingjie, Li Wanzu, Wu Yao, and Li Kuan, as representatives, to see Mayor Wu through the help of the Global Overseas Chinese Association in order to report the real situation in Mexico. We hope that Mayor Wu will care for the Overseas Chinese and relieve the distress of the four-hundred thousand Overseas Chinese in Mexico.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Petitioning <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>At 5 PM, Li Kuan and 12 other Chinese traveled by car and visited Mayor Wu through the help of the general director of the Global Overseas Chinese Association, Peng Canguang, Chen Muxian, and Fang Difai. Mayor Wu was amiable and allowed the representatives to explain the situation in Mexico. Mayor Wu dispatched Bureau Second's Section Chief Li to the Guang Zhao Public Office and Guangdong Travel Shanghai Association and asked them to give financial assistance. The representatives excused themselves at 6 PM after it was discovered that Mayor Wu was helping with finances. Mayor Wu will write a telegram to the central authorities and ask them to negotiate with Mexico.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Appreciation <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The overseas Chinese are thankful that the Overseas Chinese Association sent people to entertain and drive them around. Li said that the association protects the Overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Chamber of Commerce Welcomes <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>At 7:00 PM, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet of welcome, attended by Yuan Ludeng, Lao Jingxiu, and over seventy others. Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcome speech, saying: "The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of all Shanghai merchants, extends a warm and sincere welcome to your delegation. We understand that the nation you represent is embarking on a new historical stage. The next ten years will be a crucial turning point in history, marking both the harvest of years of effort and the beginning of new struggles. The Chinese and Filipino peoples share close geographical proximity, early trade relations, long-term residency, and many common interests. Therefore, we have unlimited sympathy for the Filipino nation and are willing to provide all possible assistance within our means. In recent years, European countries have competed to strengthen their tariff barriers, leading to overproduction, worker unemployment, and financial panic. Despite politicians racking their brains, no good solution has been found to resolve this serious situation. New emerging nations and new emerging countries should strive to avoid this. It is now very clear that international economic conditions dominate politics. Therefore, if one wants to open up a new life politically, one must first establish a solid foundation economically. Fortunately, the Filipino nation, due to its unique environment, has not yet been swept into the tide of economic downturn and still has opportunities to act proactively. The members of your delegation, recommended by your government, are looking for new commercial markets in neighboring countries during the preparation period to avoid various future difficulties. This task is currently the most important one, and it is also what our Chamber wishes to express its deep sympathy for. China has the world's largest population and can absorb a large amount of goods, while the Philippines' sugar, rice, timber, tobacco, etc., are currently needed by China. The Chinese nation has always adhered to an open-door policy. Although the tariff agreement system has been abolished in recent years, the determined import tax rates still maintain a fair attitude. Among all countries in the world, few, if any, besides China have not erected high tariff barriers. The Chinese people have always adhered to a principle of generosity and mutual concession. We are willing to reciprocate fairly to any country that treats us fairly. This is evidenced by the large import of Russian goods into China after the resumption of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations, which serves as a clear precedent. Therefore, as your delegation seeks new markets, our Chamber suggests that China is the best market, and the Chinese people are the best customers. Although there has been a history of several centuries of mutual import of Chinese and Filipino goods, it has all been handled by others and has not had a profound impact on the Filipino nation. In the next ten years, a new era will be ushered in politically, and a new organization will inevitably emerge in commerce at the same time. Therefore, future commercial exchanges between China and the Philippines will be practically in the hands of the Chinese and Filipino peoples, and we will gradually feel that we have common interests. Our Chamber believes that your delegation should suggest to your government to take this opportunity to establish a fundamental policy of economic cooperation. Any policies implemented in the past few years that are inconsistent with the spirit of economic cooperation should be gradually corrected to maintain the close ties between the oldest neighbors. The foundation of any endeavor must begin with understanding and mutual concession. Our Chamber believes that today's meeting, if adopted by your delegation, will be nothing less than a preliminary economic conference between the Chinese and Filipino nations. We sincerely hope that you will not disregard our humble opinions and will enlighten us. I respectfully raise a toast to the successful completion of your mission and your health on this trip."</p>

The French Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Meyrier, Mr. Fuqi, president of the Western Aviation Association, and more than fifty French expatriates were present to welcome her. The Chinese Aviation Association originally also intended to send representatives to the scene and host a banquet, but because Mr. Lin Wojiang went to Beijing for consultations, they did not go. Only Liu Songjian, a patrol officer from the Sixth District First Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Inspector Sui Guoqing were on site to take care of matters. After disembarking from the plane, Ms. Boucher immediately thanked the welcomers and took a group photo with the French consul and others, then took a car to the French Consulate for rest.

<p>Talks Delivered Yesterday</p>
<p>The solicitation of aviation saving the country funds in this city is about to end.

I hope that all team leaders and citizens will work hard to solicit donations and enthusiastically participate in the next few days, striving to achieve the goal of two million yuan. Because Shanghai is a region of national financial concentration, the national economic center, and a place where wealthy merchants from all over the country gather, it should logically have very good results. If Shanghai does a good job in saving the country through aviation, then the whole country will see it, the news will spread, and all places will work hard and have good results. If the whole country has good results, then the grand vision of saving the country through aviation can be achieved. Therefore, please, team leaders and citizens, pay attention and strive diligently."</p>

<p>China National Aviation Corporation Representatives Return to Shanghai from Sichuan</p>
<p>Satisfactory results; preparations to be intensified immediately.</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, in order to complete the Shanghai-Chengdu route, the China National Aviation Corporation sent Business Director Huang Baoxian to Chongqing to negotiate with Sichuan military leaders such as Liu Xiang to expand the section. Now Mr. Huang has completed his mission and returned to Shanghai from Sichuan the night before. That evening, he reported everything to the company's General Manager Dai Enki. The reporter visited yesterday to inquire about the negotiation process. It is said that the results of this trip were very good. The Sichuan military leaders have no more problems with it, so it is possible to complete the route. The company believes that this move is a great development and has now ordered the aviation team to intensify preparations to ensure that it opens as soon as possible. According to reports, the section is only two hundred li, but because the roads in Sichuan are as difficult as climbing the sky, both water and land transportation are inconvenient. Now, with the Stearman land plane flying, it only takes one and a half hours to arrive. Its speed cannot be measured in li. The preparation period is at most one month, and it is expected to be implemented on June 1st, flying from Shanghai to Chengdu.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Three Ministries Discuss Developing Trade with Russia <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Russian Delegation Arrives in China Early</p>
<p>Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the import of Russian goods into China has been increasing daily, while the export of Chinese goods to Russia has not seen any improvement. In order to remedy this, the Central Government ordered the Ministries of Industry, Finance, and Foreign Affairs to consult. According to news from the International Trade Bureau, the three ministries have held two joint meetings and decided on a plan. The details are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e166">State-Run Trade with Russia <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Russia's foreign trade is all state-run. Exports are based on not hindering their own needs, and imports are limited to necessities. Therefore, Soviet Russia has planned trade, while our country has free operation with no planning, and its failure is inevitable. Now the three ministries have decided to establish a Sino-Russian Trade Company in Shanghai, which will be operated by the state. The establishment procedures have been submitted to the Central Government for approval and will be opened immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Prohibition of Raw Material Imports <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The three ministries also decided that in order to prevent the import of industrial and commercial raw materials from Soviet Russia from hindering the future of our country's industry and commerce, a draft of the rules for the import of Russian goods into China was prepared, prohibiting the free import of raw materials, with the principle of not hindering small-scale industry. Furthermore, in view of the fact that Chinese merchants have limited capital and insufficient foreign trade capabilities, they have now begun to organize a banking syndicate, led by state banks, to provide special loans and assist in the development of trade with Russia.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Russian Delegation to China <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet authorities attach great importance to trade. In order to connect with Chinese merchants and investigate China's economic situation, they have specially organized an economic delegation to come to China for on-the-spot inspections. It was originally scheduled to depart in mid-May, but it is now known that because the Russian Ambassador has arrived in China and the arrangements have been made, they decided to depart early at the end of this month, arriving in Shanghai via Vladivostok. At that time, we will prepare a welcome reception.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Our Investigation Team to Russia <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Since the Central Government believes that after the completion of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, there has been great progress in the country, and industry and commerce are becoming increasingly developed, which is worthy of our learning, it also intends to form an investigation team to Russia. One person will be selected from the relevant ministries and commissions to go with local business leaders. The expenses are set at 10,000 yuan per person, with approximately forty people as the limit. This initiative is currently underway, and it can be launched as soon as the funding is obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Chinese Areas on Temporary Alert Yesterday <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Preventing Disturbances Under False Pretenses by Reactionary Elements</p>
<p>With the difficult month of May approaching, the Chinese and concession police authorities in this city have decided to intensify their alert from May 1st to May 31st, as in previous years, in order to maintain local security. At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Wen Hongen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report that the Communist Party planned to distribute leaflets in the name of national salvation groups. He immediately notified the Inspectorate, the Detective Team, and the police stations in each district to pay close attention and report at any time. Fortunately, no accidents occurred until late at night.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Unscrupulous Merchants Smuggle Enemy Fish <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Although Detained in Liuhe, They Have Already Been Loaded</p>
<p>The Enemy Fish Inspection Association Sent Letters Requesting Severe Punishment and Investigation</p>
<p>According to Shen Bao Telegraph Agency's local news, after Japanese fishing boats repeatedly infringe on our maritime rights, they are selling all kinds of fish they catch in Shanghai. However, the majority of our fishermen are deeply aware of the general situation and refuse to sell them on consignment. At the same time, the Fish Inspection and Anti-Enemy Goods Association is making every effort to prevent them from being sold in Shanghai and disrupting our fish market. Therefore, in recent times, Japanese fish have almost disappeared from the Sixteen Puh fish market. At the same time, because the Japanese fishing boats' fish are difficult to sell in Shanghai due to our strict inspection, they have changed their strategy, specializing in colluding with a small number of unscrupulous merchants, who use sandboats to buy them at cheap prices in the Tongsha waters outside the Wusongkou area, and then transport them to various ports along the river such as Zhaoliuhe, Xupu, and Jiangyin for sale. This plan not only allows enemy fish to penetrate deep into various inland ports along our river, but also causes a significant loss of national tax revenue. However, without evidence, there is no way to start. It was not until yesterday that the Enemy Fish Inspection Association was secretly reported by colleagues that this poisonous scheme was exposed. When the reporter learned of the previous situation, he went to various places to investigate. The results obtained are detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Chen Hanzhang Informed <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Chen Hanzhang has been a fisherman for a long time, but in view of the fact that during the January 28 Incident, the Japanese army wantonly bombed the Liuhe area, causing villages to be reduced to ruins, he has always held a grudge in his heart and vowed never to sell enemy fish again. At the same time, because some people who disregard the overall situation believe that Japanese fish are highly profitable, they have abandoned domestic fish, which has led to Chen Hanzhang's business repeatedly losing money. Therefore, he often thought of exposing the conspiracy to smuggle enemy fish. On the 27th, two sandboats full of enemy fish arrived at Jiang Liuhe, and he went to the Liuhe First Branch of the Taicang County Public Security Bureau and the Sixteenth Team Headquarters of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Maritime Public Security Bureau to report. However, both places believed that Chen had other motives and reprimanded him for meddling, and refused to accept the case. Chen had no choice but to rush to the Enemy Fish Inspection Association in this port at 10:00 AM to report. This is how the Enemy Fish Inspection Association learned of the enemy fish being transported to Liuhe.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Rush to Liuhe for Inspection <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>After receiving Chen's secret report, the Association believed that Liuhe did not belong to the scope of this city, but driven by conscience, it could not ignore it due to boundary relations and allow enemy fish to be sold rampantly in the interior. Therefore, it immediately prepared an official letter (details omitted) and sent Standing Committee members Jin Chuxiang and Huang Zenshi, along with Chen Hanzhang, who provided the secret report, by car to Liuhe. After arriving, they first delivered official letters to the Public Security Bureau's Maritime Patrol Team and the Liuhe District Branch of the Taicang County Party Department, requesting them to send personnel to assist in the inspection. As a result, the Public Security Bureau and the Maritime Patrol Team did not send personnel for the time being. Chen Fengqi, the manager of the Gongsheng Company that sold the enemy fish, Zhang Qixiang, a Standing Committee member of the District Branch, and Jin and Huang from the Enemy Fish Inspection Association went to the dock for inspection. The small yellow croaker, rice fish, sole, sea eel, etc., loaded on the boat were all Japanese fish. Just as they were about to return to the Public Security Bureau and the Maritime Patrol Team to report, Chen Fengqi, the manager of the Gongsheng Company, disappeared without a trace due to guilt. Then, the three men, Jin, Huang, and Chen, went to the aforementioned two places to request that the enemy boat and enemy fish be temporarily guarded overnight for disposal the next day. They then returned to this port by the original car to report. It was already 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Talks by the Two Standing Committee Members, Jin and Huang <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>When the reporter visited the Enemy Fish Inspection Association yesterday, according to the two Standing Committee members, Jin Chuxiang and Huang Zenshi, inspecting enemy goods is the Association's duty and the assertion of its conscience. With a fearless spirit, they carried out strict inspections. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the Liuhe Public Security Sub-bureau yesterday, the bureau chief repeatedly made excuses and reprimanded Chen for having other motives, and even said that Chen should not have reported to the Shanghai Inspection Association. After saying this, he angrily entered the room, regardless of the guests in the room. Fortunately, Jiang Liang, the captain of the Sixteenth Detachment of the Maritime Police, was still aware of the general situation, and was able to handle the matter. Huang also said that there were two pieces of evidence to confirm that it was enemy fish: (1) There were more than 600 dans of enemy fish in total. The scales of the small yellow croaker were broken, and there were many miscellaneous fish (i.e., sea eels, etc., which domestic goods do not have). (2) During the inspection on the boat, the boat women were asked and learned that the fish were purchased from the Tongsha waters outside Wusongkou. If so, there should be no rice fish mixed in, because the place of origin of rice fish is in Zhoushan and not in Tongsha. Moreover, all the small yellow croaker on the ship was sold in Liuhe, while the rice fish and other fish were still transported to Shanghai by car. The license plate number of the car transporting the fish is City Government Note 18556, Concession Note 1384. The two sandboats transporting the fish are Customs Shanghai Zero Six Five Zero and Public Works Bureau Five Two Seven One Four.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Letter to the Taicang County Party Department <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, since the Liuhe area is under the jurisdiction of Taicang, the Association specially sent a letter to the County Party Department, asking them to use the Party's fearless spirit to severely punish the unscrupulous merchants. The original letter said, "Greetings. There are more than a thousand Japanese fishing boats in our Jiangsu and Zhejiang coastal areas, catching fish all day long, causing our fishing village economy to go bankrupt. The lives of our millions of fishermen who depend on fishing for a living are in jeopardy. In order to save the country and save our revenue, we have gathered comrades to organize this Association. Since its establishment, it has actively resisted Japanese fishing boat fish, which no longer dare to be imported openly. Unexpectedly, unscrupulous merchants are extremely cunning and use the trick of swapping the sky for the sun, hiring civilian boats to buy Japanese fishing boat fish outside Wusongkou and falsely claiming they are domestic goods to evade national taxes. Our Association received a secret report from citizen Chen Hanzhang of Liuhe on the 27th, saying that two sandboats of Japanese fresh fish had arrived in Liuhe. Our Association sent Standing Committee members Jin Chuxiang and Huang Zenshi to investigate by car, along with Mr. Chen, and sent official letters to the Liuhe Public Security Bureau's Maritime Police Team and District Branch, requesting assistance. After inspection by our Association's representatives, together with Comrade Zhang Qixiang from the Second District First Branch, it was confirmed that the fish scales were incomplete and were undoubtedly caught by Japanese fishing boats. The sandboat numbers are Customs Shanghai Zero Six Five Zero and Public Works Bureau Number Five Two Seven One Four. This cargo was purchased from the Japanese by Zhu Yuqing, a native of Liuhe and manager of the Gongsheng Company. It has been more than once that the Gongsheng Company has colluded with Zhu Yuqing to transport Japanese goods because of the high commissions. Our Association's representatives requested the Public Security Bureau to detain the unscrupulous merchants and sandboats, but the bureau chief shirked his responsibility, seemingly having a close relationship with the unscrupulous merchants, and severely reprimanded the informant, Chen Hanzhang, for not reporting to the Shanghai Inspection Association. Comrade Zhang Qixiang, a Standing Committee member of the Second District First Branch, witnessed this matter. Our Association's exposure of unscrupulous merchants is driven by conscience, while the Public Security Bureau chief, as a member of the nation, not only does not do his best to support the patriotic movement, but suppresses it. The destruction of the country is imminent, and we are deeply saddened. Your Association is the vanguard of the people of Taicang. We ask you to use the Party's fearless spirit to severely punish these unscrupulous merchants who are transporting Japanese fish in this shocking case, so as to eliminate unscrupulous merchants and prevent others from following suit, and to benefit the anti-Japanese movement. May the Party be fortunate and the country be fortunate."</p>
<h3 id="e176">Enemy Fish Have Already Been Loaded <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Later, according to Mr. Jin, the Maritime Patrol Team was requested to temporarily guard the enemy fish overnight, pending resolution yesterday. The Fish Inspection Association received another telegram from the original informant, Chen Hanzhang, at 8:00 PM on the 27th, saying, "(Daping waiting two number Shanghai Fish Industry Inspection Enemy Goods Committee Jin Chuxiang, Goods have been loaded, the boat wants to escape, please Huang (Zhenshi) come to Liu (Liuhe) quickly, Chen (Hanzhang)." According to the above telegram, not only has the enemy fish been completely loaded, but the sandboat carrying the enemy fish is also about to escape. After the Association was informed, it sent a letter to the Party and government agencies of Taicang County for investigation, and notified the Qingjiang Customs to pay attention to the evasion of tariffs, and to prevent such sandboats from smuggling Japanese fish for sale in the Liuhe, Xupu, and Jiangyin areas, in order to maintain national tax revenue. It also sent a letter to the Transportation Industry Association, inquiring about whose car was used to transport the enemy fish, and requesting that it be investigated and warned.</p>

<p>It is said that he escaped safely yesterday</p>
<p>Some say that the price was not agreeable, details omitted</p>
<p>The general manager of the Yunfei Automobile Company, Sheng Xiegui, was kidnapped by bandits near the corner of Huanlong Road and Masinan Road near the company at eight o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Since the incident occurred, the French authorities and people from all walks of life have paid exceptional attention. Detectives from the French Concession Police Department were almost all dispatched, hoping to solve the case in the shortest possible time. However, around five o'clock yesterday afternoon, the French Concession Police Department suddenly received news that Mr. Sheng had escaped from the bandit's den and was safe. This newspaper also received the report at the same time. The reporter immediately went to the company to inquire. It was said that Mr. Sheng had indeed escaped safely at five o'clock in the afternoon, but they refused to answer how he had escaped. When asked where the bandit's den was, they only said that it was very close and still belonged to the French Concession. Finally, the reporter asked if he could meet the hostage, but it was said that Sheng did not return to the company directly after his escape. No one knew where he was. However, in the end, the reporter inquired in detail from all parties and learned that the price for Sheng's release was more than 50,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Guo Zhushu's Letter Reports the Anti-Japanese Process of Su Bingwen's Troops <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Su, together with Ma, Li, Wang, etc., have gone to Europe and will return to the country soon</p>
<p>General Su Bingwen led his troops in Heilongjiang to resist Japan, with remarkable achievements. Due to the depletion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, he entered Russian territory last winter. He has now taken a route through Europe and will soon return to the country from Italy with Generals Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, and Wang Delin to continue resisting Japan. Mr. Guo Zhushu, General Su's secretary, was ordered to return to the country first and has already arrived in Ping. Yesterday, he sent a long letter to his Shanghai friend, Mr. Wu, reporting the anti-Japanese process of General Su in great detail. The following is an excerpt from the original text:</p>
<h3 id="e182">Unyielding Loyalty <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Su Gong [referring to Su Bingwen] swore an oath of loyalty and remained steadfast. He trained his troops and prepared for battle, and the hardships he endured during the year were such that he could not enjoy his food or sleep peacefully. The brutal Japanese knew that Su Gong was not one to be subdued, so they resorted to despicable means, tempting him with great wealth. First, Ogihara Shigeaki tried to persuade him with a grant of 500,000 yuan. Second, Komura came to Harbin in person to comfort him, promising to give him 1,000,000 yuan. Third, Lin Xiuyi came, promising to allocate over 600,000 yuan to repay back pay. Fourth, Komatsubara sent an airplane to Dawuli, asking the Soviet consul to act as intermediary, offering 2,000,000 yuan. Su Gong remained unmoved by all of these offers. They then tried to entice him with high official positions, urging him to enter the provincial capital. The puppet state repeatedly sent important officials from both the Japanese and puppet sides to invite him to take on positions such as Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Commander of the Border Defense Forces, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, and Commander of Beixing'an Province.</p>
<p>All of these were rejected, as he was determined to preserve a piece of clean land for the Republic of China and to win some glory for the Chinese nation. With unwavering determination and iron will, he defended and protected his territory alone. At that time, due to the lack of bullets and military rations, he dared not launch a formal uprising early on. Furthermore, the Hulun area was mostly a pastureland for nomads, with white grass and yellow sand stretching for thousands of miles. No matter how much he wanted to expand his forces, it was like a clever woman trying to cook without rice. It was not until October 1st of last year that he learned that the League of Nations was about to hold a meeting. He could no longer allow the brutal Japanese to deceive international ears, and he had no choice but to stake everything he had on one throw of the dice, to show that the puppet state of Manchukuo was not recognized by the 30 million people of the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Course of the Anti-Japanese Resistance <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Before launching the uprising, he repeatedly telegraphed the authorities in Beiping, requesting supplies of firearms, airplanes, and funds to bolster his strength. However, the telegrams disappeared like snow, as if a yellow crane had flown away, never to be seen again. Although there were occasional replies, they were all empty words. It was heartbreaking to think about, and brought tears to one's eyes to talk about. But the situation was urgent, and there was no time to delay. After much deliberation, there was only one option: to fight. Therefore, on September 27th, he secretly ordered the troops stationed in Manzhouli, Hailar, and Boketu to simultaneously resolve the brutal Japanese international police force. On October 1st, he sent troops to Fularji, officially starting the war against the enemy. At that time, I was serving as the deputy director of the general headquarters secretariat, working in the forward headquarters. I was close to the front lines and fought fiercely for two months, until the bullets ran out and reinforcements were cut off. We defended the strongholds of Yaoku Lezhujia Kan and other defensive locations. At that time, we still foolishly hoped for support from the interior so that we could launch a counterattack. However, the delay continued, and we had reached a point where we were running out of resources. On November 30th, the enemy used all available weapons, such as airplanes, heavy artillery, and tanks, to encircle and attack Zhalantun. Our troops initially intended to defend the city, but after engaging in hand-to-hand combat, they were eventually unable to hold out and retreated. I, along with Xie Ke, the chief of staff of the forward headquarters, Jin Guibi, the deputy chief of staff, Dong Shuhong, the chief of staff of the Second Brigade, and others, were still at the headquarters in Zhalantun. Fortunately, we managed to break through the encirclement and arrived at Halasu, sixty Russian li away, at two o'clock at night. The suffering was unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Situation of Retreating to Russia <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>On December 1st, we returned to Hailar. At this time, Su Gong realized that the overall situation was hopeless, and there was no way to advance or retreat. If we delayed any longer, we would surely be captured. He resolved to withdraw from the country. Komatsubara of the brutal Japanese was still in Dawuli, conveying through the Russian consul that he still hoped to buy Su Gong's loyalty with 2 million Japanese yen, promising to forgive his past actions. Su Gong replied to the Russian consul with the words "The head can be cut off, but the will cannot be bent." So on the 3rd, he led all his troops to withdraw to Manzhouli. The people flocked to pull the carts, unwilling to let them leave. On the morning of the 4th, we left the country and arrived at Sharason in Russian territory. The military and civilians numbered over 4,000 people. We were detained in the Soviet Union for two months. The treatment we received was considered generous according to Soviet customs. However, from the perspective of our country's customs, those who were once strong and capable became emaciated and pale. The pain was unimaginable. In early February, we heard news of returning to the country, and everyone was overjoyed.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Returning to the Country via Europe <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>I and the others returned to the country by sea to Ping, while the troops had already returned to Xinjiang. Su Gong had also set off from Russia to Europe to return to the country. Once Su Gong has a confirmed date of arrival in Hong Kong, I will go to Shanghai to prepare for a welcome, and we should be able to meet at that time. I heard that Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Soong Ching-ling, and other gentlemen are in Shanghai. When I meet with them, I will describe in detail Su Gong's anti-Japanese perseverance and unyielding spirit. I am very grateful. Guo Zhushu bows respectfully.</p>

<p>Rescuing the Two Luos</p>
<p>Expelling Wu Mai from Membership</p>
<p>The Provisional National Executive Committee of the China League for Civil Rights held a meeting at 4 p.m. on April 26th, and resolved many important cases. (1) Passed the articles of association. (2) Invited lawyer Tang Mingshi to go to Beijing to rescue Luo Dengxian, Luo Zhanglong, and others. (3) Regarding the two professors, Ma Zemin and Hou Wailu, who were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment in Ping, it was resolved that lawyers should be asked to carry out rescue in accordance with the law during the appeal period. (4) Member and executive committee member of the Shanghai branch, Wu Mai, his views and recent actions are inconsistent with the purpose of the League, and it was resolved to expel him. It is also heard that Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan has replied to the letter from Cai Yuanpei, the vice-chairman of the League, regarding the rescue of Luo Zhanglong, stating that he has telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government that if Luo has no riotous behavior, he can be dealt with leniently.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng She said that according to foreign sources, the Sino-Polish Treaty of Friendship, signed in 1929, will expire on September 18th this year. The Polish government intends to request the National Government to continue it in effect for three years. If China agrees, it will not be modified and will follow the provisions of the treaty, with both countries being completely based on the principle of equality. The Polish side has no consular jurisdiction in China, and Polish overseas Chinese are fully protected by Chinese law and treated the same as Chinese people. As for the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Treaty, it will expire on the 15th of next month. However, since the treaty was signed, almost three years have passed, but it has not been implemented because the French side cited the fact that the tariff rates for reciprocal goods have not been stipulated, so there is no such thing as expiration.</p>

The original telegrams are recorded below: (1) Chuyu Brother, Office of the Northeast National Salvation Army, Sapo Sai Road, Shanghai, I left Shuang for Tomsk on March 11th and will be able to set off to return to China soon. The families of my troops will arrive in Shanghai early on the 9th of this month on the Weideng Wheel. Please take care of them. Wang Delin.

<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs Convenes Labor-Management Mediation</p>
<p>The Factory Agrees Not to Reduce Wages and Subsidies</p>
<p>The Tianyi Silk Factory on Zhengsheng Road, Tilanqiao, has caused a dispute due to opposition to the factory's reduction of wages. The workers have petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs twice. At 9 a.m. this morning, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened both labor and management parties for mediation at the Bureau of Social Affairs. Chen Jixiang and Tu Lianfeng, representatives of labor, and Zhang Tingcheng and Zhang Zhongyu, representatives of capital, were present. The mediation was presided over by Tan Peiyan, a mediator from the Bureau of Social Affairs. The capital side stated that the price of silk has been low recently, and each piece has to lose one yuan, so it implemented a wage reduction. The labor side argued that the factory has repeatedly reduced the diligent work award and other subsidies, and it is really difficult to withstand this blow. After repeated persuasion by the chairman, the capital side finally agreed to automatically withdraw the wage reduction issue and maintain the status quo for the time being. Both parties were satisfied at the time, and the dispute was resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Xiao Zhenying Returns to Shanghai from Jiangxi <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Returning North Soon</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that Xiao Zhenying, representative of Song Zheyuan, commander of the 29th Army, went to Jiangxi to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on defense affairs and ask for instructions. He returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties the day before yesterday. According to what Xiao told the Central News Agency reporter,</p>
<p>The bandit areas in Jiangxi Province have long been surrounded by the National Army, but the military force on the south side is relatively weak, resulting in the breakout of the Communist bandits, and the situation was quite rampant for a time. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression, the bandit forces have been greatly reduced. If the southwest side can send troops to the Jiangxi border early and work together to suppress the Communists, it will not be difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. Once Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has properly deployed the anti-bandit affairs, he will go north to command the anti-Japanese military affairs. The date of departure is not far away. Commander Song is currently attending a military conference in Ping due to excessive fatigue and recurrence of his back pain. He is discussing the anti-Japanese military plan in detail. Once the official duties are completed, he will return to the defense area soon. Commander Song was assigned to the position of Chairman of Chahar Province, but because he is in the war zone and has no time to take care of it, he previously submitted his resignation. The Central Government has now instructed the Director of Civil Affairs of Chahar Province to temporarily serve concurrently so that Commander Song can concentrate on commanding the military affairs. According to a recent telegram from the front line, the enemy troops in the Xifengkou and Luandong areas are retreating step by step. Our advanced troops have already advanced beyond the Great Wall and recovered the original positions. The reason why the enemy retreated in Xifengkou and Luandong is that they intend to move west to Miyun and attack Beiping from the side, occupying the military base of North China. The rumors of compromise are rumors created by the enemy and have other effects. I hope that the people of the country will not believe them lightly and fall into a trap. I will return north in the next day or two to meet Commander Song and report everything. I will not come south for the time being.</p>

<p>The 233rd Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government held its 233rd municipal conference on April 14th. Luo Panhui, Wu Xingya, Wen Hongen, Cai Zengji, Shen Yi, Pan Gongzhan, Li Ting'an, Jin Liren, and Xu Peihuang attended. Yu Hongjun, Yang Hu, and Zeng Zesheng attended as representatives. The chairman was the mayor. The items discussed were: 1. Discussing the construction of the Qiujiang Wharf. It was resolved that Secretary-General Yu should discuss the plan with Director Shen, Director Cai, and Director Xu and submit it to the next meeting for discussion. 2. Planning to take over the International Cemetery. It was resolved that the directors of the four bureaus of health, public works, land, and finance should jointly formulate a plan for taking over and expanding it and report it to the meeting for discussion. The Director of the Health Bureau was designated to convene the meeting. 3. The new houses of the government and various bureaus will be completed soon. Issues such as water, electricity, transportation, staff dormitories, and relocation procedures should be resolved quickly. It was resolved that: (1) The issue of water and electricity supply should be planned by the Municipal Central Area Construction Committee. (2) The issue of transportation should be planned by the Public Utilities Bureau. (3) The issue of staff dormitories should be planned by the Finance and Public Works Bureaus. (4) For the issue of relocation, a relocation preparation committee should be organized, and the Municipal Central Area Construction Committee should formulate articles of association and submit them to the meeting for discussion. 4. Before the land practice certificate is issued to the landlords in the central area of the city, they intend to make flexible arrangements to issue construction permits for investment and construction projects. It was resolved that in principle, construction permits should be issued after the case of the original owner and the original tenant's contract being declared invalid has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and registration. However, if the competent bureau predicts that the construction project will not cause major disputes, it may handle it flexibly according to the circumstances. 5.

<p>The traitor Wang Bingzhai, along with Jin Guoting and others, transported goods and acted as guides for the enemy army during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai. Because a villager, Quan Baogen, dismantled their means of transportation, he was shot and killed by the traitors. After investigation by the Public Security Bureau's detective team, Wang Bingzhai was arrested and transferred to the local court. After investigation, it was confirmed that Wang Bingzhai had committed the crime of murder, but there was no other evidence. After prosecution, the criminal court conducted repeated inquiries and debates. Yesterday, the imperial edict was issued for sentencing. Wang Bingzhai was sentenced to fourteen years of fixed-term imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Thieves Arrested in the Perfume Lane Robbery Case <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The home of a certain doctor at No. 520 Perfume Lane, Nanjing Road, was invaded by a number of thieves on the 18th of last month, and property worth more than 1,000 yuan was robbed. The case was reported to the Lao Zha Police Station for investigation. Last night at 11 o'clock, Wang Shusen and Hu Wenfu, the Chinese detectives of the police station, learned that the gang of thieves was hiding in Room 123 of the Asia Hotel on Hankou Road and Room 103 of the Southeast Hotel on Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. They immediately went to the addresses separately and arrested Shen A'er, Tang Gengsheng, Lian Heshang, He A'wei, Xing Zhenghua, Jiang Yulong, Pu A'bao, Guo Liansheng, Chen Linggen, Bao A'fa, Chen Anbao, Tang Amao, and Wang Yukang, a total of 13 people. A wallet containing more than 100 yuan in banknotes was seized and taken back to the police station for detention. This morning, they were sent to the First Special Court Criminal Division 1. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the circumstances of the arrest and said that Shen A'er and Xing Zhenghua had already confessed to the theft. However, due to the limited time, they were unable to conduct a detailed investigation and requested permission to detain them. Judge Qian Hongye reported the case and briefly questioned the defendants. He ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e197">County Government Issues a Notice Prohibiting the Digging of Owned Reed Roots <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received a report from the second district chief, stating that Qiao Caigen and other citizens of Huajing Town jointly reported that they owned the滩滩 land of Huangpu 灘滩 in Jingkou Township of the town to plant reeds. They sprouted in February and March every year, and grew into adults in July and August. They have exhausted their efforts to maintain them. If they are slightly negligent, the harvest will be greatly reduced. Because it is灘滩 land, there is nothing else to plant. Once they are disappointed, they will complain and suffer. However, recently, villagers in the urban area who also hold licenses from the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, in groups of three or five, dig reed roots along the灘滩 and sell them to pharmacies for profit. Now that the sprouts are sprouting, they will inevitably wither once they are trampled on. How can we expect a harvest? Paying taxes is an obligation that should be fulfilled, and protecting property rights is a right that should be obtained. For this reason, we forward it to your Excellency, requesting that you issue a notice prohibiting it and order the public security branch to effectively stop it. On the one hand, please write to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and ask it to transfer to the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and shall not abuse the license and the required medicinal reed roots, and should order the excavation of unowned 灘灘 land and natural growth, not where farmers sow, in order to maintain agricultural production. County Chief Cao, after receiving the report, has issued a notice prohibiting it, and shall not dig up the reed roots of owned灘滩 land again, otherwise</p>
<p>investigation will be carried out immediately and no leniency will be given.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Case of Lu Shuiquan Inducing and Raping Ye Cuie Determined <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Five Years in Prison</p>
<p>Ye Cuie, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 70 Taian Lane, North Fujian Road, is seventeen years old and used to study at Ye Shitian's Qiankun Sutan and also went to the Great World to perform. In November last year, Lu Shuiquan, a Suzhou man who was working as an assistant and reciting Xuanjuan at Ye's place, saw that the woman was young and could be deceived, so he used seduction methods, using the excuse of going to a temple fair, and repeatedly induced Ye to go to various hotels and raped her in private rooms. It has been almost half a year since then, when the woman's father, Ye Afa, found out and reported it to the police. The police sent detectives to arrest Lu Shuiquan and send him to the First Special District Court. The police station prosecuted him for rape. After one trial, Wu Tingqi, a judge, came to the Criminal Court No. 8 yesterday morning to continue the trial. He still ordered that no bystanders be allowed and questioned Ye Afa and Ye Cuie again. According to the defendant Lu Shuiquan's firm statement, he had raped Cuie in private rooms many times. His parents were all aware of it. Because Cuie is now eighteen years old, her father wanted to recruit me as a son-in-law. After the Shanghai Incident occurred, I lived at Ye Afa's place for several months and paid five or sixty yuan for rent and eight yuan for evacuation expenses. Usually, the rice, firewood, and charcoal for the Ye family were all supplied by me. There was no intimidation or rape, etc. However, Ye Afa said that Cuie was only seventeen years old, a snake, and there was no intention to recruit Lu as a son-in-law. Ye A'e, Cuie's sister, also reported the case, proving that her sister was seventeen years old and that she was twenty-two years old, a rat, and five years older. Finally, after Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, and Fan Gang, the defendant's agent lawyer, debated with each other, Judge Wu announced the end of the debate and pronounced the judgment in court. The defendant Lu Shuiquan was given a reduced sentence of five years of fixed-term imprisonment for the crime of continuous rape of a girl under the age of sixteen. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was equal to one day of imprisonment for every two days.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Unified Market Price for Opium Shops Starts Today <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Two Offices Set Up in the Concessions</p>
<p>Price Evaluation Association Issues and Announces Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Opium Shops Association believes that the wholesale and retail market prices of the industry in the city are very chaotic, which has long been criticized by customers, and it is necessary to actively rectify it. Later, the representatives of the industry decided in a general meeting to set a deadline for the establishment of a price evaluation committee, etc. The following is a record of the progress of the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Three Measures Agreed Upon <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The association has repeatedly convened industry meetings at the Ningbo Road Association and appointed Chen Liangyu, Feng Baofen, Zhang Ziqing, Tong Decheng, Zhang Guanlan, Ye Yunfang, Chai Ganglin, Dong Keliang, and more than ten others as price evaluation committee members. The price evaluation committee then agreed on three measures: (1) When releasing opium and wholesaling opium, a meeting and an opium release book must be carried, and the number must be recorded in detail to prove it. (2) Sales must be carried out according to the price list, and there must be no private reduction or mutual depression. (3) For shops that disrupt prices, first- and second-class shops will be fined 100 yuan for the first offense and 200 yuan for the second offense. Third-class shops will be fined 10 yuan for the first offense and 20 yuan for the second offense. For the first offense, a warning will be given, and for the second offense, the association certificate will be revoked.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Two Offices Established <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>In order to quickly communicate the market situation and unify the price evaluation, two offices have been set up in the British and French concessions, and Zhang Guanlan has been elected as the director. It is now learned that the location of the British Concession has been selected at Wuding Road, Xinzha Road, and the French Concession is at Songshan Road, Xiafei Road, and will officially start work within days. However, according to Chen Liangyu, chairman of the industry, the industry has been deeply rooted in its old habits, resulting in the association's efforts for several months, and the market price has still not been neatly unified. He feels sorry for this, but the association should still continue to work tirelessly to save the credibility of the industry that has been lost to customers.</p>
<h3 id="e203">First Rectification of Market Prices <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Price Evaluation Committee convened a committee meeting at the Ningbo Road Opium Shops Association at 4 p.m. yesterday, with more than ten people including Zhang Guanlan attending. Chairman Chen Liangyu made decisions on both wholesale and retail market prices and immediately issued public market prices, ordering the industry to fulfill the notice. This is the first time since the establishment of the Price Evaluation Association, which is particularly important to the industry's rectificiation efforts. The following is a copy of the notice: Due to the soaring foreign prices, several kinds of cigarettes in the previously issued price list are related to the blood cost. The association has decided to increase the prices at this month's meeting. It is hoped that you will sell according to the following prices, and do not reduce the prices and suffer losses yourself. This is very important. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>丨Six Years and Six Months Imprisonment丨</p>
<p>Xu A-mei, a local worker at the French Tram Company, was arrested by the police in September of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931] for promoting reactionary ideas and inciting worker strikes. She was then handed over to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for public prosecution. After trial, she was sentenced for endangering the Republic of China and disrupting the electric power industry, with a combined sentence of ten years and six months imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for twelve years. Xu, dissatisfied with the original judgment, filed an appeal with the Supreme Court. The case was now remanded to the original trial court for a retrial. The Third Branch of the High Court has repeatedly held hearings and debates, and awaited the pronouncement. Details have been previously reported. Yesterday afternoon, the pronouncement was made. At 2:30 PM, Criminal Court President Zhou Yunhui, along with Guo Dezhang and Fan Peien, two recommendees, and Prosecutor Zhang Shouru, arrived at the Third Criminal Court. They ordered Xu A-mei to be brought to the court. The verdict was for endangering the Republic of China by organizing groups, sentencing her to six years of imprisonment; and for disrupting public electric power services, sentencing her to one year and six months of imprisonment, with a total execution of six years and six months of imprisonment. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. After the sentencing, the presiding judge also explained to Xu that leniency was granted because the crime occurred before the March 5th general amnesty of last year. If she was dissatisfied, she could file an appeal with the Supreme Court through the court within ten days of receiving the judgment. After the pronouncement, she was returned to the detention center to await further instructions.</p>

<p>Li A-jin and Gu Xiaomei</p>
<p>Li A-jin, 22 years old, was from Nanxiang, Jiading. He came to Shanghai to sell beans a few days ago, and his boat was docked west of the New Garbage Bridge. Around 7 PM the day before yesterday, he suddenly lost his balance when standing up and fell into the water. His body has not been found. At the same time, Gu Xiaomei, 18 years old, the young daughter-in-law of the Shen Wang family in the neighboring boat, went to watch after hearing someone had fallen into the water. In her haste and panic, she also lost her balance and fell into the water. Gu Xiaomei's body was found in front of the Jiangsu Bank's warehouse around 8 AM yesterday and was recovered by people.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Record of the Shanghai Gas Company Shareholders' Meeting <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Dividend of Two Taels Per Share Resolved</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company convened its annual shareholders' meeting the day before yesterday. General Manager Bell reported that although the amount of gas sold last year was less than the previous year, the profits increased due to the lower cost of coal after the depreciation of the Japanese yen. The amount of gas sold last year decreased by 4.75% compared to the previous year, an unprecedented phenomenon since 1925. However, the decrease was entirely due to the Sino-Japanese war. The actual consumption is now returning to an upward trend. If the current peaceful situation can be maintained, the total consumption in 1933 will definitely exceed that of 1931. Although there was a decrease in revenue, direct losses from the war, and an increase in coal transportation costs last year, the operating conditions were still satisfactory. Gross profit increased by 93,631 taels compared to the previous year, but net profit did not increase by the same amount due to news of bank loans used to improve the factory and losses from the exchange rate of foreign currency. The construction of the new Yangshupu factory is progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by the end of October this year. The insufficient funds for this factory improvement are temporarily covered by bank loans, which will be repaid by selling the Xizang Road property in the future. Subsequently, various proposals were passed and new directors were elected. The final dividend for last year was resolved to be two taels per share.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Going Across, Coming Upright <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Who says God is inflexible? Even God has to be flexible. Because the Republic of China has suffered many losses in the horizontal direction, it will be compensated in the vertical direction. Going across, coming upright—this is great news for old folks with antique obsessions, worthy of a smile through tears.</p>
<p>How did we suffer losses in the horizontal direction? Alas! It's painful to say. The Republic of China's terrain used to be described as resembling a half of a Chinese flowering crabapple leaf; now, it has become a half of a mulberry leaf eaten by silkworms. We are watching helplessly as the evil demons cut off three large pieces from the map of the Northeast and a large piece from the map of the North. The horizontal area has shrunk a lot. I don't know how much more it will shrink before it stops. Old folks with antique obsessions say: "Don't panic, don't rush. What's lost horizontally will be gained vertically. We have Zhou dynasty ritual vessels, Han dynasty stone statues, jade tablets made by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang dynasty, and real swords from Yuan Tiangang. These many priceless treasures are all being unearthed straight from the ground. We've lost horizontal borders, but we've gained vertical treasures."</p>
<p>Fourteen complete Zhou dynasty bronze artifacts were discovered in Teng County, all priceless treasures. A Han dynasty stone chamber was also discovered, with murals covering the walls. In a certain place in Shandong, a jade tablet used by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang dynasty for offering sacrifices was unearthed, with complete inscriptions. This spring, the tomb of King Jian of Zhao was discovered in Donghuiying Village in the northwest township of Zhangde, with a stream of green water inside, spreading far and wide. The tomb of Yuan Tiangang, a famous Tang dynasty figure, was also discovered next to the tomb. The Academia Sinica sent personnel to the site to investigate and photograph. Around the tomb were gold artifacts, and a treasure sword, a gold sword, and a gold Taoist crown were suspended from the top of the tomb, along with gold ornaments worth over ten thousand yuan. The discovery of treasures is endless. Now, the newspapers are reporting on it extensively. If we observe China with an archeological eye, we can forget the pain of losing territory and be filled with the immeasurable joy of digging up treasures.</p>
<p>If the tripods, plates, duns, and lis obtained in Teng County can be used as air defense equipment; Emperor Xuanzong's jade tablet can resist tanks; wearing Yuan Tiangang's gold Taoist crown and wielding Yuan Tiangang's treasure sword and gold sword can be a hundred times more effective than Song Zheyuan's Broadsword Brigade; then, with the treasures gained vertically, we won't be afraid of the territory lost horizontally. Alas! It only wins the appreciation of a few antique collectors and cannot explain the worries and fears of the people of the whole country. Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e210">Elixir of Immortality <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Zi</p>
<p>Even if plants and animals are not subject to accidental attacks, when they get old and their blood weakens, or when their cell tissues decline, they will inevitably die of old age or their branches will wither and decay. Humans, being one of the animals, can of course not avoid that road of two legs kicking up. Foreign countries have a kind of business of transplanting youth glands, but that is only the same as great philanthropists building bridges and roads, building temples and burning incense, and gaining the power of prolonging life. After all, it cannot achieve immortality. In the deep mountains and swamps of China, there are many old Taoist priests and strange monks who can fly over eaves and walk on walls, who specialize in the methods of burning elixirs and refining mercury, and the way of collecting yin to replenish yang, saying that they can achieve immortality and replace bones. But when the time comes, they still inevitably alas, pay their respects. It can be seen that longevity may or may not exist, but immortality is impossible.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Japan, which has always prided itself on its scientific development, actually became superstitious about immortality, according to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the 21st. Based on hundreds of volumes of ancient literature brought to Japan by the great swindler who deceived Qin Shi Huang, after painstaking research, they actually invented a elixir of immortality. This elixir is a medicinal wine full of strange aromas, which has attracted the attention of all sectors of society. I think there must already be many friends who are afraid of death who have tried it, and drinking this wine every other day, there must be no one who doesn't get out of bed the next day, so the newspapers all praise it as a panacea, and this news has spread to China. From now on, Chinese people will regard burning elixirs and refining mercury, and collecting yin to replenish yang as pedantic. If Qin Shi Huang had obtained this medicine earlier, he might have extended the Great Wall all the way to Arabia, and now he is still engaged in burning books and burying scholars.</p>
<p>However, I don't know if drinking this wine has the effect of being invulnerable to broadswords. If it does, then we Chinese are in trouble. If every Japanese person takes this wine and only lives and does not die, the population will be too much, desperately wanting to develop on the mainland, then we Chinese are even more in trouble.</p>

<p>— Ba Shaozhen</p>
<p>March 28, eating sugarcane at Hongshan, this is a common saying in Wuhan. I don't have time to turn to the almanac to examine its history. I once asked a monk, and he said: (March 28 is the anniversary of the establishment of Hongshan Pagoda).</p>
<p>This day, let's talk about this year's day, because the weather is very good, not cloudy and not scorching sun, plus the arrival of Saturday, so half of Hongshan is occupied by tourists.</p>
<p>The number of ferries across the river has increased specially today. Jianghanguan has five ships, and Wangjiagang has four ships. We give it a total of nearly 20,000 people crossing the river, and the ferry fare is almost 1,000 yuan, most of which is to Hongshan. This is Hankou.</p>
<p>From Wuchang Road to Hongshan is about ten miles away. This road has now become (Shanyin Road), and people have never stopped walking on it from morning to dusk.</p>
<p>People who are free, today, not only occupy Hongshan, but also the national sports in E, Zhongshan Park in Hankou, Huashang Racecourse, etc.; are all crowded. Here, it feels that there is no (national crisis) in people's minds.</p>
<p>Hongshan has nothing but a pagoda, no ancient sites to admire; Tian Ziqin's tomb; there is still some architectural value; Baotong Temple: just a formal ancient temple, wait! Isn't Li Pusa and his wife's shell afraid that the Dongyang people will move to Japan to display them, so they transported themselves to Hubei? He is now living in Hongshan, although the survival of Peiping was already in our expectations? Hubei is originally a land of happiness. Li Pusa (life) (death) is all blessed. He is now in Hubei, and I think Hubei will not be lost: let's see the construction of his great tomb!</p>
<p>But (March 28, eating sugarcane at Hongshan), I don't know the story of this (sugarcane) | most people don't know; what I know is that there is a lot of sugarcane in Hongshan today, and everyone who comes has to eat it, this is true.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Anecdotes of Divorce <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Since China was baptized by the European and American winds and rains, it suddenly broke the shackles of etiquette and the great defense between men and women. Freedom and liberation, social openness, unfamiliar men and women, in cinemas or dance halls, fell in love at first sight, then kissed and shook hands, swore oaths and made promises, and became a couple living together. That was the most convenient thing. But not long after, because of small disagreements and disagreements, both parties hired lawyers and announced their divorce in the newspaper, which was also extremely convenient. So if you flip through the newspaper, there isn't a day when you don't see divorce cases printed in endless pages.</p>
<p>Once the trend of divorce started, even our literary colleagues felt the pain of parting. The first one was Xu Zhenya. He wrote in the notes of Thirty Miscellaneous Memories: (Yu and Ruizhu divorced twice. In the autumn of Xinyou, after mediation by relatives and friends, she was allowed to return: : : : This was the last divorce, but because the procedures were not yet complete, the family could not immediately marry another woman for me: : : ) From this, it can be seen that their marriage was very strong, and this divorce was out of passivity. There was also the late Bi Yihong, who was married for seventeen years and had many children. His wife suddenly divorced him. In his pain, Yihong wrote an article (Children After Divorce) and sent it to me for publication in Xingguang magazine. It was written very painfully. Recently, Jiang Xiaojian's divorce from his wife caused a sensation in the newspapers. There were mixed praises and criticisms, and his case was almost regarded as an important historical material in the history of divorce.</p>
<p>I accidentally flipped through a book of Mu Du Small Records, which recorded Xue Zhu's hearing and judging of divorce cases. Although it was old news from the past, it was very humorous. It might be a good idea to transcribe it and let modern people see it: (Xue Zhu was an old man in Mu Du Town. He sat in the Shenming Pavilion and listened to a divorce case. Zhu scolded the woman's father and said: Why do you discuss divorce? He said that the son-in-law was poor and unbearable. Zhu said: If you want to divorce, you will be fined ten gold. The old man gladly took ten gold and said: I ask for a letter of divorce. Zhu said: Not yet! He immediately ordered someone to go home to take ten more gold and pay it to the son-in-law and said: Choose a good day to get married! The old man stomped his feet and said: Why did you fine my gold and then remarry him? Zhu said: You dislike him for being poor, now there are twenty gold, which can be used to complete the ceremony and start a career. The woman's father was speechless, and the son-in-law thanked him and left. ) This kind of wonderful judgment, I hope that modern judges can take it as a model when hearing divorce cases.</p>

<p>Old Man Zhao stroked his beard, only smiled, and after a long time said: Dry girl, that's dispensable, : : : He said here, holding a hesitant attitude, and finally he continued: Let's talk about it in the future. Guizhi heard these words, felt that there was something in the words, and was embarrassed to interrupt, just lowered her head. On New Year's Eve, without firecrackers, it seemed much calmer, and this night seemed even longer. Everyone had nothing to say, wrapped some dumplings, Old Man Zhao yawned a few times! Mrs. Jiang said: Old master is going to rest, right? Why hasn't Xiaolin come? Old Man Zhao said: Let him go, he's so afraid of seeing people, it would be painful for him to sit here. Mrs. Jiang said: The old master is probably going to rest. Let's take the noodles and stuffing back to wrap them. Saying that, she stood up. Old Man Zhao thought that the two women were women and could not force them to stay here to keep the year, so he smiled: It doesn't matter if you come to wrap them tomorrow. I don't have any taboos. Mrs. Jiang then prepared the things and took her daughter home. As soon as she entered the door, Xiaolin brought a white stove, the coal briquettes burning inside, the flames were raging. He smiled: Old Mrs. Yang, our old master said, you haven't been in the house for a long time, I'm afraid the fire is out, called me to send the fire. Mrs. Jiang kept thanking him. Before long, Xiaolin also</p>
<p>sent a pot of boiling water and a large bag of mixed snacks, and also asked: Old Mrs. Yang, do you have tea leaves? If not, I'll go get some. Mrs. Jiang said: Thank you for the old master's thoughtful consideration, we already have tea leaves here. Xiaolin heard that everything was fine and then left. Mrs. Jiang then said to Guizhi: The old master is such a good person, what are you unwilling to do if he becomes your superior? Guizhi blushed and said, What are you talking about? How could he become my superior? Mrs. Jiang smiled: Don't worry, I didn't say it out, if you worship him as a dry father, wouldn't he be your superior? Guizhi said lightly: People are unwilling, you old saying, aren't you ashamed of being poor? She only said this one sentence and didn't talk down. (Five Six)</p>

<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>May Concerts</p>
<p>This year's May can be considered a (music month). Concerts will be held in succession.</p>
<p>(1) Brahms Centennial Concert</p>
<p>(2) Weekly Symphony Concert</p>
<p>(3) Chinese Ancient Music and Dance Concert</p>
<p>(4) Wagner Fiftieth Anniversary Memorial Concert</p>
<p>(5) Ying Shangneng's Solo Recital</p>
<p>The Brahms Centennial Concert will be performed by the Municipal Council Orchestra, conducted by Mei Baiqi. There will be a solo performance by the famous Russian pianist Moiseiwitsch. It will be held on the night of May 7 at the Guangming Theater.</p>
<p>Brahms was an outstanding German composer of the 19th century. Born in 1833 and died in 1897. He composed more than 200 songs and solo pieces, and is a great master among song composers. He was a reactionary classical musician, whose style drew inspiration from Beethoven on one hand, making him a major authority in the pure music school, and on the other hand, had a classical tendency in the romantic style, which showed Brahms's special style.</p>
<p>Benno Moiseiwitsch was born in Obusha, Russia, and lived in London from an early age. He learned piano at the age of five, won a music scholarship at the age of nine, and studied with the famous teacher Leschetizky in Vienna at the age of fourteen. He gained fame at the age of fifteen and is now a world-renowned pianist.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ancient Music and Dance Concert is scheduled to be performed at the Great Brightness on the night of May 21, sponsored by Mrs. Folitz. It is said that Mei Lanfang has been hired as a guide.</p>
<p>The Wagner Fiftieth Anniversary Memorial Concert will be conducted by Mei Baiqi and will be performed publicly at the former Guangming on May 28.</p>
<p>Wagner was a great genius in the world of music, with the title of (King of Opera). Born in 1813 and died in 1883. His representative masterpieces include the operas (Lohengrin), (Parsifal), (The Flying Dutchman), (The Meistersinger of Nuremberg), (Tristan and Isolde), (Tannhäuser), (Rienzi), (Die Feen), (Der Ring des Nibelungen), etc. It is said that eight famous singers have been hired for this night to sing selections from Wagner's masterpieces to express condolences for this German musician who passed away fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Ying Shangneng's solo recital will be held at the American Women's Club at 9:15 pm on May 10. Dai Cuilun's violin solo will also be participating, and Miss Li Xianmin will be the piano accompanist.</p>
<p>Mr. Ying Shangneng is a vocal music professor at the National Conservatory of Music. The program has been pre-scheduled, including works by Brahms, Massenet, Handel, Kreisler, etc., as well as Ying Shangneng's own (To My Beloved) and Zhao Yuanren's (Also Slight Clouds), (Small Poem), (Listening to the Rain), etc.</p>
<p>Shanghai men and women who are used to hearing the saxophone and jazz music in dance halls or movie theaters may feel over-stimulated by the fast pace expressed in those emerging musics. Then, you might as well look back and appreciate these concerts that will become historical traces. In these night music concerts that preserve the spirit of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, at least, we can awaken our old musical dreams; and it can make us re-savor the elegant meaning of the classical school and the beautiful mood of the romantic school.</p>
<p>Personally, although I have a nostalgic feeling for Western music, I have never been able to feel interested in Chinese ancient music. Two weeks ago, on the night I met the Polish modern composer Tansman at the World Academy, I listened to the ancient music performance of the Datong Music Society, and only felt that the so-called Chinese ancient music only lacked harmonious harmony. Bringing many instruments together, only playing a simple melody, it is completely primitive music. Used to listening to symphonies of Western orchestras, I am really not used to listening to Chinese music. However, I am very satisfied with the fact that the Datong Music Society is willing to abolish the commonly used Chinese Gongche notation and switch to the staff notation commonly used in the modern music world, at least in one point.</p>

<p>Complete Finals and Awards Ceremony This Afternoon</p>
<p>The second Shanghai All-City Middle School Joint Sports Meet was held yesterday for the second day. The number of spectators increased even more, and the competition gradually reached a critical stage, so the interest was even better. According to the total scores of each school in the past two days, Guanghua has thirteen points for male A, Guanghua has twenty-six points for male B, Wuben has fifteen points for female A, and Aiguo has nineteen points for female B, all of which occupy the most dominant position. Yesterday, the commendable thing was that the 100 meters, high jump, and javelin for male A, the 400 meters and shot put for male B, and the shot put for female A all exceeded the previous conference records. In addition, the 100 meters for male B and the 50 meters for female A were equal to the previous records. The complete finals will be held this afternoon, and it is expected that there will be even better results. After the competition, an awards ceremony will be held. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e216">Yesterday's Grand Occasion <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was beautiful, not inferior to the previous day, and the gentle breeze made it even more refreshing. The spirit of the athletes to win the championship was even better. The number of visitors continued to surge, and the paths were crowded, with over 20,000 people. Many middle and elementary schools also led teams to visit, and the school uniforms were generally neat and new, which was pleasing to the eye. The Boy Scouts maintained order, which was more effective than the previous day and very strict. Their spirit of service was commendable. The American Fox Company was still filming sound movies on the field. The conference started at one o'clock and continued the sports, which ended at six o'clock. Overall, the interest was even stronger than the first day.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Championship Situation <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>丨Men's A and B Groups</p>
<p>丨Guanghua Steadily Wins the Championship</p>
<p>According to the competitive situation in the past two days, the championship situation is gradually emerging. In the male A group, Guanghua is currently in the lead with thirteen points, followed by the High School Affiliated to Great China University, which is trying to compete with Guanghua for the top spot, currently with eleven points, only two points less than Guanghua. In today's finals, the two schools will do their best to compete, and other schools may find it difficult to compete. Although Southern Middle School also has as many as ten points, the general trend is gone, and hope has been cut off.</p>
<p>Guanghua Affiliated Middle School can steadily sit at the top of the male B group, having already obtained as many as twenty-six points in two days. Other schools are far behind, with Upper Middle School in second place, with only eleven points.</p>
<p>Aiguo Girls' Middle School currently has nineteen points in the female B group, ambitious, and has great hope of winning the championship. Miss Guan Yanjiao, the proud daughter of heaven, won the first place in both the long jump and shot put, totaling ten points, and is the main force of the national team. Wuben has a strong momentum in the track events. Although it currently has fourteen points, which is five points less than Aiguo, it is not without the hope of winning the championship. Let's see the competition between the two schools today.</p>
<p>Wuben can also steadily win the championship in the female A group, currently with fifteen points. Peiming is second, with ten points, presumably not an enemy of Wuben.</p>
<p>The physical education schools do not distinguish between male and female championships, and the scores are calculated in a mixed manner, just to compare the advantages and disadvantages. East Asia has many talented people, with a total of fifty-seven points. Jiangnan relies entirely on the strength of men, and also has as many as twenty-three points. The next is Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers with thirteen points, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teachers with five points, and China Women's Physical Education Teachers with five points.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were four final events for men's and women's track and field events. The competition in each event was very fierce. The 100-meter and 1500-meter races were particularly interesting. A brief record is as follows:</p>
<p>▲100 meters: In the first track event of the opening, the 100-meter final, the men's group A took the field first. Eight people competed fiercely. The situation was extremely even. Dong Yinchu of Kwang Hua took the lead by half a step. The others were almost in a line, speeding past, and it was difficult to tell the difference. After a long consultation by the referees, it was decided that the second place was Li Songnian of Great China High School, the third was Liu Jiaxian of Minli, and the fourth was Cheng Zhihong of Fudan High, with a time of 12.2 seconds. The group B was also quite even. Wang Xiangsheng of YMCA High School won by one step, with a time of 13 seconds. The situation at the finish line of the physical education group was fierce. The first and second places were Yang Fang and Li Yanxiang of Jiangnan, with a time of 12.3 seconds.</p>

<p>▲50 meters: The women's A group started the final. Wuben had a lot of talent and monopolized the top two and fourth places. The sprinting skills were excellent. The order at the finish line was quite obvious. Xiao Jieying, who had the best results in the preliminary and semi-finals, finally won the championship with a time of 7.8 seconds. The top three in the women's physical education group were monopolized by the three veteran players from East Asia. Qian Hangsu was only listed in position. The champion was Chen Wanqing, with a time of 7.6 seconds. The women's B group still had the strongest force in Wuben, winning a total of nine points.</p>
<p>▲400 meters: In the 400-meter final, Grandpa Guan (Changfa) after all dominated, winning the championship with 56 seconds. Wang Xiangsheng won the first place in Group B easily, with a time of 59 seconds. Li Yanxiang of the Physical Education School Group won the championship, with a time of 56.4 seconds. The last three places belonged to East Asia.</p>
<p>▲1500 meters: The competition in the men's A group was extremely fierce. The situation was tense from beginning to end. It is not easy to see such an even long-distance run. Fang Dezhong of Yuqing released one and a half laps and finally fell behind. Ye Kanquan of Pudong closely followed behind, once taking the lead, thinking that he could be selected, but that was not the case. Cheng Zhiyuan of Great China sprinted in the lead with 300 meters remaining, thinking that he could win the championship. Unexpectedly, in the last 30 meters, he was surpassed by Ji Songen of Qingxin. Ji won the championship with 4 minutes and 6 seconds. Cheng was second. The third and fourth places were Wu Zijing and Zhan Yiji, who were not far behind. Liu Chongli of Kwang Hua dominated Group B, with a calm attitude and not panting at all. The results of the Physical Education School Group were relatively the best. East Asia won the top two places, and Jiangnan won the last two places.</p>

<p>[P As I Remember It</p>
<p>Wang Keyong is Impartial: Disciplinary Officer Mr. Wang Keyong ran around the venue, serving enthusiastically. Seeing people without badges in the field, no matter who they were, he expelled them from the field. He was impartial and invaluable. The order of the venue was well-maintained.</p>
<p>Strongman Attracts Attention: Yesterday, Jianguo High School performed strength feats. There was a strongman, Lin Shouzhang, who was an overseas Chinese from Nanyang. He entered Jianguo last fall and performed feats of strength against twelve people. The method was to tie a rope around his hand, and six people at each end pulled hard. Mr. Lin did not move at all. The second performance was breaking stones on the chest. Lin's head and feet were supported on two benches, his abdomen was empty, and three large stones were placed on top. One person held an iron hammer and struck the stones, breaking all three stones in succession. The audience was speechless.</p>
<p>Javelin Broken in the Middle of Throwing: Yesterday, in the javelin competition, the meeting prepared four javelins in total. Unexpectedly, halfway through the competition, all four javelins were broken. The competition had to be suspended, and another heavier javelin was purchased. This was really because some athletes lacked training and did not know the method of throwing.</p>
<p>What Honor Does Famous Athlete He Rongzhi Have?: Guan Changfa of Southern High School, unanimously regarded as a famous track and field athlete, has attended national and Far Eastern conferences. It is not known that Guan recently studies at Southern High School, competing with mediocre high school students, winning first place in the 400 meters with 56 seconds. What honor does he have?</p>
<h3 id="e227">Sidelines at the Venue <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>▲Colorful Attire: The warm sun shone all over the Chinese track and field venue. The more than 20,000 sports fans around were students, socialites, silver screen stars, young masters, and young ladies. In short, old and young, they crowded the entire stand. Because of this, their clothes also changed into various different colors, reflecting dazzling light in the sunlight.</p>

<p>▲Several First-Place Numbers: During this sports meeting, it was very rare that the numbers of several first-place athletes were people's trademarks. For example, Gu Yu, the first-place high jumper from Southern High School, happened to be 212. Also, Mr. Ji Songen from Qingxin High School, his number was one, and in the 1500-meter final, he was also first.</p>
<p>▲Three Sweaty Stones: From the booming sound waves of the command platform, after Jianguo High School performed fitness exercises, the school's strongman, Lin Shouzhang, led three comrades who looked like steel-boned and heroic, performing various fitness exercises. In the chest-breaking stone section, he lay on two benches, his body was empty, and three large stones were stacked on top. After the three stones were smashed, more than 10,000 spectators were sweating.</p>
<p>▲Xi Quanbao Cried: Miss Xi Quanbao, the Little Mulan of Wuben, did not cry because she could not run to first place. She cried because she resented her fate too much. What was the matter? In the preliminary round of the 200-meter women's Group B, she quickly took the lead, but after 150 meters, she suddenly fell. She endured the pain and continued to run, but she had already been eliminated. Her husband helped her to the medical team. Blood had already flowed from her wrist and her leg. She cried, resenting her fate too much.</p>
<p>▲Minli Fought the Reporters' Team: After the Minli volleyball performance, many reporters temporarily launched a team and decided to challenge them. A few minutes later, they formally lined up and started fighting to the sound of the horn. In the end, because they were not familiar with the way, the reporters' team was defeated.</p>
<p>▲It's Hard for Mr. Chi Jianong: Gong Jianong, a male actor from Mingxing Film Company, also visited the box yesterday with a Miss Mou. However, he was so attractive as a movie star that the corner of the command platform became lively. Most of these were students, but Mr. Gong was embarrassed.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Association Petitioned Party and Government Organs Yesterday <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Teachers' Association, in order to assist various schools in the French Concession that have been forced to suspend classes, specially appointed four representatives, including Sheng Xugong, Xu Zehaixiang, Liu Zirun, and Cheng Daomin, to carry petitions to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Education Bureau, and the Municipal Party Headquarters. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Petition Details  At 10 a.m. yesterday, they first went to the Municipal Government to petition. Mayor Wu was attending a municipal meeting, so Secretary Zhang received them. He briefly stated that the Municipal Education Bureau had already reported on the matter of the French Concession authorities forcing schools such as Chenxi within the concession to suspend classes. At the same time, the Municipal Government had sent Secretary Geng to the French Municipal Council to make a serious representation, and they have now agreed to restore the suspended schools within a very short period of time. The representatives of the Association then put forward three requests: (1) Request the Municipal Government to quickly negotiate with the French authorities to restore the suspended schools within a very short period of time. (2) Request the Municipal Government to lodge a serious protest against the French authorities' overstepping their authority to interfere in China's educational administration. (3) Request the Municipal Government to declare to the French authorities that the same situation should not occur again in the future. Mr. Zhang expressed his full acceptance and promised to relay it to Mayor Wu. Subsequently, they went to the Municipal Education Bureau, where they were received by Zhou Feicheng. He briefly stated that after the incident occurred, the Education Bureau had sent personnel to negotiate with the political department of the French Concession and reported it to the Municipal Government for approval. It would not cause students to be out of school for a long time, and it would be resolved within a very short period of time. Finally, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition, where they were met by Section Chief He of the Civil Training Department. He said that the Municipal Party Headquarters was not aware of the incident when it occurred. Now that the French Concession authorities have overstepped their authority to interfere, they should consult the Municipal Government to make a serious representation to the French authorities in order to protect Chinese education within the concession.</p>

<p>Amateur Group A Billiards</p>
<h3 id="e233">Li Gongying, 1932-1933, Crowned Shanghai Billiards King <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>▲Final Three Games丨2,000 Points vs. 1,600 Points to Win the Championship</p>
<p>▲Yesterday's Results丨Li Gongying 500 Points, Medina 100 Points</p>
<p>Former Champion Medina Relegated to Runner-Up</p>
<p>Billiards in Shanghai is becoming increasingly popular, and in recent times, it has become prevalent in major clubs. Many enthusiasts are people from the Chinese and Western business communities. The Shanghai Amateur Billiards Association is the only organization in Shanghai that promotes the sport and has a long history. In the last four years, since Li Gongying of China and Medina of Portugal have been vying for the championship, it has attracted more attention. This year, sixteen famous players from China, England, Portugal, and other countries participated. From the opening to the end, some games were evenly matched and tense, while others had disparate skills and one-sided situations. However, the most exquisite performance and inspiring spirit were seen in the final three games between Li Gongying and Medina, which can be described as an important record in the history of billiards in Shanghai. The award ceremony was held yesterday after the competition, and the awards were presented by Mr. Clark and Mr. Biquet. The large and small silverware on the stage was dazzling. Li Gongying won the Group A Championship, Marx won the Group B Championship, and Li Gongrui won the Group C Championship. In addition, the Chinese team won the China-England international match. Li Gongying, Shen Lince, Zhang Yingda, Liu Fuzong, Xu Shizhang, and other members of the Chinese team, as well as members of the English team, all received awards.</p>
<p>Li Gongying Wins Shanghai Billiards Championship</p>
<p>▲Li Huaying Deserves the Title, Avenging Two Years of Humiliation...Triumphing Today</p>
<p>Anyone who talks about billiards knows Li Gongying, and people even call him the Billiards King of China. Li Gongying is also known as Li Maochong. He used to be a football star. From 1929 to 1930, he participated in the Shanghai Amateur Group A billiards competition and became an instant success, winning the championship. Famous players from China and the West were amazed. From 1930 to 1931 and from 1931 to 1932, the Portuguese player Medina rose to prominence, and Li was relegated to runner-up, waiting for an opportunity. Until this year, in the final game of the finals, Li won a great victory, 500 points to 100 points. The final result was 2,000 points to 1,600 points, regaining the championship. He avenged two years of humiliation and triumphed today. In short, Li's setbacks in previous years were not due to inferior billiards skills, but to insufficient cultivation. In yesterday's competition, Li completed 500 points in 27 shots, averaging 18.5 points, which is a rare achievement. Among the 27 shots, only 5 were misses, and the rest were more or less successful. The most he scored was 105 points. Throughout the game, Li controlled everything, always leading from the front, and the distance became greater and greater towards the end. Li gave it his all, and his calm and composed attitude was superior to others, which is why he overwhelmed his strong opponent and was crowned the Billiards King of Shanghai. The highest records of the day are as follows: 32, 45, 50, 21, 105, 34, 29, 27, 50.</p>
<p>▲Medina Runner-Up, Full of Hope...Hope Dashed</p>
<p>Anyone who knows Li Gongying knows the Portuguese player Medina. Medina is Li Gongying's only strong opponent. Medina excels at sending balls in all kinds of billiards techniques, and his cultivation is also beyond the reach of ordinary people. In the recent three games of the finals with Li, he was more than 150 points behind at the beginning of the first game. Relying on his perseverance, he moved forward side by side, and the cheers for him to win the championship were even louder than for Li. Unexpectedly, in yesterday's final game, he greatly changed his usual state. In 26 shots, he did not score more than 20 points once, which was not what Medina should have done. But the fact was so. In the first few shots, Li scored many high scores, which shocked him, and he became flustered. Later, he tried to steady his will and work harder, but it was a futile effort. He gave up the championship title to others and returned to the runner-up position, waiting for next year.</p>

<p>丨The Murderer Flees Without a Trace丨</p>
<p>Zhang Acai, who worked as a carpenter, was shot and killed on East Sports Association Road last week. The local security reported the case to the local court for investigation and arrest of the murderer. Now, the Public Security Bureau has found that Pan Yudi, who runs a bicycle shop, had a feud with him. Pan designed to kill him upstairs. The family members proved that it was Pan Yudi who did it. The police were immediately dispatched to arrest Pan. His wife, Jin, and accomplices Shen Xingfa, Wang Shun, Gao Yaoren, Cao Lin, Xu, and others were also arrested. The group said that they did not know about the fight. However, Pan Yudi has fled and has no address. It is clear that he killed someone and fled in fear of punishment, while his wife and others helped move the body, so they were all detained. However, the cause of the case was originally a love triangle. Pan set up a lunch banquet at home and invited Zhang to the banquet, and then shot and killed him. Jin, Pan's wife, confessed to this. Therefore, the case is clear, and the Public Security Bureau prepared a document yesterday and transferred it to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>For Chinese and foreign merchant ships entering and leaving the Wusongkou, it is customary to hire Jiang pilots. There are no less than three or four hundred people in this city who work as Jiang pilots. Although the Songhan Water Guide Association has been established, the members have deep-seated prejudices against each other. The current president of the association is Yang Honglin from Guangdong, and the non-Guangdong members do not seem to be very satisfied with him, and rifts are often revealed. Recently, Yang and a Mr. Zhang were involved in a lawsuit in court. Li Guangyin, a member of the Water Guide Association from Hubei, was summoned to court to testify. Li's testimony was mostly unfavorable to Yang, and Yang hated him for it. On the 17th of this month, Li went to the Water Guide Association at No. 36 Sixth Floor, Sijing Road, to collect his salary. Yang, relying on his status as the president of the association, criticized Li for not standing up to testify before, which led to a quarrel. During the quarrel, Li's face was punched and his waist was injured by a chair. He was persuaded to leave by the people in the association. Later, Li felt humiliated for no reason and filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Local Court, requesting the prosecutor to verify the injuries, and filed a criminal self-accusation against Yang Honglin for assault, demanding that he be punished according to law to deter the violent. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Ren of the court convened the ninth court to summon both parties for interrogation. Nearly a hundred water guide members of the Yang faction came to court to listen, all dressed in Western suits. There was overcrowding in the audience. After the judge took his seat, he first summoned the plaintiff Li Guangyin to inquire about the circumstances of the conflict. Li detailed the incident. His younger brother, Li Guangfu, proved that his brother went to the association that day to collect his salary and was beaten in the face and waist by the defendant Yang Honglin, the president, in the writing room. The defendant Yang Honglin completely denied the assault, saying that the plaintiff had pre-empted wages from the accountant Ying Shuxin without permission, which led to a dispute, and that he had come forward to mediate. Ying Shuxin admitted that he had a conflict with Li because he did not agree to Li's request. The other two witnesses also claimed that Yang Honglin did not beat the plaintiff. The plaintiff's lawyer then began to argue, saying that according to the association's articles of association, unemployed members should also receive a monthly salary. The witnesses presented by the defendant usually received financial assistance from the defendant, and their testimony was naturally biased in favor of the plaintiff. The witness Li Guangfu, although he was the plaintiff's younger brother, the testimony did not contradict each other as a result of separate interrogations in court, which showed that the defendant's assault was indeed a fact and should be punished. The defendant's lawyer then defended the defendant, saying that the plaintiff's accusation was not true and was nothing more than an attempt to reduce the defendant's status through a criminal case, so he requested that it be rejected and that the plaintiff should be charged with false accusation. The judge ruled that the defendant's assault had constituted a crime and ordered him to pay a fine of twenty yuan as a warning.</p>

The girl went out to wander around and did not return home until about 11 pm. The girl's father and brothers, fearing that she would do something wrong outside, persuaded her. Unexpectedly, the girl was unwilling to submit and argued with them. The next day, the girl thought about it, was full of resentment, and suddenly had the idea of giving up on life. She secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. Her father noticed that the girl was moaning in bed and foaming at the mouth, so he immediately sent her to Baojiang Hospital. The rescue was ineffective, and she died soon after. The hospital reported to the Xinzhabei Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. They took the body to the Fielun Road coroner's office.

According to the testimony of the girl's father, Feng Yinsheng, he was working the night shift in the hotel that day, so he had not returned home. His brother, Keqin, worked at the YMCA and returned home every night at 9 o'clock. He saw that his sister was not at home, and waited until late at night to see her return home, which led to a slight quarrel with her. Mr. Zhang obtained the confession and ordered the coroner to determine that the deceased Feng Yaoqin had died from poisoning after swallowing opium. The body was returned to her father, Feng Yinhang, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>

<p>A collection of letters discussing the question of "Can We Return to the Countryside?" (19) A letter from Mr. Liu Enmin in this city: Further reply to Mr. Zhu Tianqing, continued (2) (After the bankruptcy of the countryside, should people from the countryside run to the cities? After the bankruptcy of the countryside, can people from the cities not return to the countryside? If, after the bankruptcy of the countryside, people from the countryside can just run to the cities to find a living, then I can boldly say that not only will the cities feel the danger of overpopulation, but the countryside will also deteriorate.) This is another illogical argument. The bankruptcy of the countryside is not a question of "(should)" or "(should not)," but is caused by the realistic, objective environment. Then, people from the countryside running to the cities is also not a question of "(should)" or "(should not)," but is caused by the realistic, objective environment. Farmers running to the cities is not for fun, nor is it "(not loving the countryside)," but because the countryside is bankrupt. Tens of thousands of them are "(running to the cities to find a living)" because the countryside is bankrupt. Now, you are advising a weak scholar (this is perhaps my conjecture), a friend who is used to city life (literate and educated) to go to the generally bankrupt countryside to find a living, and to first borrow that "(unknowable)" 200 yuan as capital by running into walls everywhere. Isn't this daydreaming? Even if we retreat 10,000 steps and imagine complete success, what benefit would building his "(new-style Utopia)" have for the vast bankruptcy of the Chinese countryside? The countryside is still bankrupt, and a large number of people from the countryside flow into the cities because the tide of farmers cannot starve for three days waiting for you "(ten years of effort)" to build a "(new-style Utopia!)" However, Mr. Zhu still wants to use the "(rural education)" of the new-style Utopia to resist "(foreign capitalism)" and "(eliminate the old-style feudal system)!" Because Mr. Zhu first said: "(If... foreign capitalism can take the opportunity to enter. At that time, the countryside will inevitably be completely ruined, beyond repair. And (the old-style feudal system) will not be able to (eliminate).)" Mr. Zhu is afraid that "(foreign capitalism can take the opportunity to invade)," so he advises people to go to the countryside to build a new-style Utopia; he is afraid that "(the old-style feudal system)" cannot be "(eliminated)," so he advises people to go to the countryside to build a new-style Utopia. It seems that foreign capital still needs to "(take the opportunity)" to invade the Chinese countryside. Isn't this daydreaming? Moreover, building a "(new-style Utopia)" to eliminate "(the old-style feudal system)" isn't that going to establish a "(new-style feudal system)?" In fact, Mr. Zhu's sentence is the most cruel criticism of the new-style Utopia, a new-style Utopia is a Utopian version of the new-style feudal system. This is called "(lightning not striking without confession!)"</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Zhu said: "(Let me tell you. The year before last, after the Mukden Incident, the students on the sea, university students, middle school students, elementary school students, male and female, they were filled with passionate blood, shouting loudly to go to the countryside to propagandize, hoping to arouse the patriotism of the farmers.</p>
<p>But what was the result? Wasn't it equal to zero?)" Mr. Zhu immediately followed with a question, "What is the reason for this? I think you have not seen through this point. Let me tell you, Mr. Liu! This is because rural education is not developed." Mr. Zhu! Thank you for your kindness! But do you know what the propaganda movement of the Mukden Incident in Shanghai was like the year before last? If you are not deliberately closing your eyes and not seeing the facts, deliberately obliterating the facts, you would not be so sophistical. When students in various places in Shanghai were propagandizing resistance to Japan, rural farmers and urban workers equally enthusiastically expressed their patriotism and resistance emotions, but were limited by the political environment. What relationship does this have with whether farmers have knowledge or education? Your meaning is that farmers have no knowledge, no education, so they don't know the meaning of "(the rise and fall of the world is everyone's responsibility)." In fact, this is your empty talk. Assuming that your "(new-style Utopia)" is common throughout China for decades or hundreds of years, farmers are as knowledgeable and educated as Mr. Zhu, which is naturally a fantasy,) then China's "(irretrievable abyss)" will be completely achieved! Because your kind of knowledgeable, educated people will be even more likely to close their eyes and not see the facts, only knowing how to avoid reality. Mr. Zhu scolds students for going to the countryside to propagandize as "(effort not rewarded)." This sentence is indeed correctly scolded: not only is it not rewarded, but they also get involved in lawsuits... (4) The various questions I raised in the first point of my previous letter only forced out today's letter from you with the sentence "(The reason why rural education in China is not developed is of course complex); going further, it is a pluralistic answer of what "(political dysfunction: etc.)." But I want to ask you: "(Why is politics dysfunctional? Why do warlords have infighting? Why do communists go to disturb? Why can't exorbitant taxes be eliminated?" We have repeatedly asked you these questions. Why don't you answer? Why don't you answer some of the questions I raised in my letter to Mr. You on April 12th, as listed in (1)? Why don't you answer the letters from other readers who question you? Avoiding answering the positive real-world questions is not a solution.</p>

<h3 id="e261">How to Make a Power Transformer <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>A transformer is made using the principle of electromagnetic induction. The purpose of a transformer is to change the voltage. Increasing the voltage from low to high is called a step-up transformer, and vice versa is called a step-down transformer. A transformer has at least two coils (a transformer with only one coil is called a single-winding transformer). The one connected to the power source is called the primary coil, and the one that supplies power to other devices is called the secondary coil. Recently, AC radios have become popular, and the use of transformers has become more widespread. This article specifically discusses this type of transformer. The power of the device is calculated in watts (Watt), which is the product of current and voltage. The unit of voltage is volts, and the unit of current is amperes. The formula is as follows: Power = Voltage x Current</p>
<p>For example, the transformer in Figure 1 has three secondary coils, so its power is the sum of the output power of each coil.</p>
<p>Primary: 200 volts</p>
<p>Secondary (1): 2.5 volts, 3.5 amperes</p>
<p>(2): 5 volts, 2 amperes</p>
<p>(3): 600 volts, 0.02 amperes</p>
<p>The center tap of the secondary coil ( ) is the center line. The two coils on either side both have 300 volts with respect to the center line, for a total of 600 volts. The current is 0.025 amperes. This is for a dual-plate rectifier tube.</p>
<p>(1) 2.5 x 3.5 = 8.75 watts</p>
<p>(2) 5 x 2 = 10 watts</p>
<p>(3) 600 x 0.025 = 15 watts</p>
<p>Total: 33.75 watts</p>
<p>Now that the power of the transformer is known, find a transformer of considerable size in the first table to know the full load efficiency, the number of primary coil turns, the number of turns per volt, and the cross-sectional area of the core.</p>
<p>For example, if the secondary output of the transformer in Example 1 is watts, find one larger than this in the table to be competent, because the transformer has a slight loss, such as the resistance loss of the primary coil and the flux leakage loss, so the power output of the primary coil must not be equal.</p>

<h3 id="e262">Economical AC Radio <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>It is often troublesome and uneconomical to change the batteries in a DC radio. If it can be converted to AC, it can be done once and for all. This article describes a two-tube radio that costs very little and is as effective as a DC one-tube radio. If the original DC radio is modified, the cost will be even less. Moreover, the transformer used in the power supply part of the machine does not need to be designed and manufactured separately. Just use a 5V, 2AMP, doorbell transformer instead to power two UY227 vacuum tubes (this tube's filament voltage is 2.5V, so they must be connected in series). Other materials, if newly created, should be purchased as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Three-circuit coil: one</p>
<p>(2) Doorbell transformer (5V, 2AMP): one</p>
<p>(3) Low-frequency choke coil (30Henry): one</p>
<p>(4) Fixed capacitor (2MFP): one</p>
<p>(5) Headphones (4000M): one pair</p>
<p>(6) Fixed capacitor (0.001MED): one</p>
<p>(7) Variable capacitor (0.0005MFD): one</p>
<p>(8) Grid leak resistor (2MEG): one</p>
<p>Fixed capacitor (0.00025MEG): one</p>
<p>Vacuum tube (UY227): two</p>
<p>UY tube socket: two</p>
<p>Other items such as wooden boards, wiring posts, wires, dials, etc., as needed</p>
<p>After all the above parts are equipped, use wires to solder according to the diagram. After completion, check for errors, then connect the current (220 volts or 110 volts are acceptable, but the doorbell transformer must match the current used). After one or two minutes, wait for the filament to heat up, adjust the regeneration coil and the variable capacitor, and you can receive the radio. This machine can receive local stations without using an antenna and ground wire. However, using an antenna and ground wire can receive broadcasts from Japan and Nanjing. If you feel that the selectivity is not good, then use only the antenna or the ground wire.</p>
<p>Editor's note: This machine takes the B-voltage power supply directly from the power cord. Therefore, the parts of the machine must not touch the ground wire to prevent danger. Inserting a capacitor with a high withstand voltage between the ground wire and the grounding post is relatively safe.</p>
<h3 id="e263">One of the Secrets of the Transmitter Key <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Ti Gan</p>
<p>(1) First, you must memorize the organization of the telegraph code, dots, dashes, and spaces, and then learn to press the key.</p>
<p>(2) The proper way to press the key is to touch the key handle with the fingertips of the right index and middle fingers. Do not use too much force, but do not be too light either. Too much force will blur the dots and dashes, and too little force will easily drop the dots. Also, do not let the fingers separate from the key handle, but gently hold it with the thumb.</p>
<p>(3) The point of contact between the fingertips of the index and middle fingers and the key handle should be relaxed and natural. Avoid being too restrained. Relaxation and naturalness make it flexible, and too much restraint makes it clumsy. Flexibility makes it agile, and clumsiness makes it slow.</p>
<p>(4) When pressing the key, the wrist should be suspended in the air, and the arm should be bent at a ninety-degree angle. Although it may seem difficult at first, you will not feel tired even after continuing to send telegrams of tens of thousands of words.</p>
<p>(5) When sending telegrams, the fingertips only need to exert force downwards. The thumb's function is only to support, not to push the key handle upwards.</p>
<p>(6) Beginners who are learning to press the key should only seek stability and accuracy. Do not be in a hurry to speed up. Seeking speed without stability will inevitably lead to panic and confusion, and it will take time to correct. It is better to send slowly and avoid trying to achieve a distant goal without success.</p>

<p>— Qian Junmu</p>
<p>Hong Liao Electric Material Store has added a broadcasting station to enhance public entertainment. Recently, it has been testing broadcasting, and the results are very good. The wavelength is 1180 kilocycles. It is said that it will officially broadcast soon.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Yuanchang Radio Station Changes Wavelength <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>The XGAIR broadcasting station attached to Yuanchang Advertising Company in this city has received an order from the International Telecommunications Bureau to change its broadcasting wavelength to 1120 kilocycles starting on May 1st. It is said that the company has complied with the order.</p>

<p>(6) Capacitors</p>
<p>The function of electricity and water have many similarities. Therefore, simple explanations of electrical principles often use water as an analogy. We previously used analogies for current, voltage, and resistance. Now, to explain capacitors, we will still borrow from water as an introduction. Water can be contained in vessels, and these vessels are called containers. Electricity can also be collected by metal plates, so devices for containing electricity are called capacitors (Condenser).</p>
<p>For example, if we have a piece of glass and attach a metal sheet (like tin foil) of approximately equal size to each side, then connect the positive and negative terminals of a dry cell battery to each of the tin foils. After briefly touching them, immediately remove the battery. The tin foil will then retain electricity. This situation is like filling a bucket with water. In electrical terms, putting electricity into a container is called charging (Charge). After charging, if we use a wire to connect the two tin foils, current will flow through the wire. This situation is like draining water from a bucket, which is called discharging (Discharge).</p>
<p>The capacity of a wooden bucket to hold water depends on the size of the bucket. A larger bucket holds more water. The same is true for capacitors. Their capacity (Capacity) depends on the relative area of the metal plates, the distance between them, and the type of insulating material in between. The larger the relative area and the closer the distance, the greater the capacity. Conversely, the smaller the area and the greater the distance, the smaller the capacity.</p>
<p>The unit of water capacity is measured in buckets or *dan* (a unit of dry measure). The unit of electrical capacity is the farad (Farad), abbreviated as F. However, in radio technology, one farad is too large a unit, so one millionth of a farad is commonly used, called a microfarad (Micro Farad), abbreviated as uF or. One millionth of a microfarad is a Micro Micro Farad, abbreviated as uuP. The commonly used term “capacity 0.00025 MFD” is 0.00000000025 F, which is 250 uuF.</p>
<p>There are two common types of capacitors used in radio technology: one with a fixed capacity and one with a variable capacity. The former consists of several extremely thin metal sheets divided into groups, placed alternately, with insulating material (mostly mica sheets) in between (as shown in the diagram). Each group of sheets is then connected together. This increases the relative area and thus the capacity. The latter is also composed of metal sheets divided into one or two groups, with one group free to move in and out of the other group to increase or decrease the relative area between the two. Air is used as the insulating material. See the lower part of the diagram.</p>
<p>In radio diagrams, capacitors are often represented by the letter C, and their symbols are: fixed capacitor 可變電容器爲 or</p>

<p>▲New Features of U.S. Radios: U.S. Radio is the most famous radio in the United States. The new models are arriving in Shanghai soon. The designs are very beautiful, divided into four-tube, seven-tube, nine-tube, and twelve-tube types, all constructed with the latest type of tubes, with very clear reception, especially suitable for out-of-town areas. Currently, the U.S. dollar is weak, so although the cost is high, the price is not increased. The general distributor is Kangmao Radio Shop at 47 Ningbo Road. The shop's service is very attentive and well-regarded by buyers.</p>
<p>▲Dahua Radio Company's Flourishing Business: Dahua Radio Company at 9 Sanma Road, Shanghai, was founded by radio experts Cao Zhongyuan and Li Weishou. It has been established for many years. The factory is large, specializing in the manufacture of various radio parts and transmitters. Production is fast, and the quality is excellent. Recently, many ships have been adding ship transmitters from the company. Those who had installed them before have sent letters of thanks, expressing satisfaction. Therefore, business has been particularly strong recently. It is said that those who want to order in the future must make reservations early, otherwise, it will be difficult to obtain the items. The company also manages several types of European and American radios, all of which are sturdy and have very clear reception. Sales have also been very brisk recently.</p>
<p>▲Repair of Sound Film Projectors and Public Address Systems: Ada Company, located at 25 Renji Road in this city, recognizing the large number of radios in Shanghai, has established a repair department to serve the community by specializing in repairing various radios for all sectors. Since its establishment, the repair business has been extremely developed. Recently, in response to the needs of film theaters and public organizations in Shanghai, and in keeping with its aim of serving the community, the company has also added a repair department for sound film projectors and public address systems used by public organizations, hiring several specialized technicians with experience in these machines. The news has spread, and theaters and organizations in Shanghai have welcomed it, saying that from now on, they will not have to worry about being at a loss when the machines break down. It is said that several theaters in Shanghai are currently in the process of signing long-term monthly repair contracts with the company.</p>
<p>▲Chinese-Made Components from the China Radio Research Institute: The various radio components produced by the China Radio Research Institute are of excellent quality and have long been well-known. It is currently building the Tianyi Radio Station, Hongkang Radio Station, Meihua Radio Station, and the Jinan Radio Station in Eastern Shandong. It is said that all the components are manufactured and assembled by the institute itself. The results have been very satisfactory. This is truly good news for Chinese goods.</p>

<h3 id="e269">Finance Before the US Currency Inflation Bill is Resolved, Both Bull and Bear Gold Market Participants Take a Wait-and-See Approach <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Transaction Volumes Low with Slight Rise and Fall of 12.5 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market continued to be stable yesterday. Transaction volume was even lower, mainly because the U.S. currency inflation bill requires a vote in the Senate on Friday. Both sides remained silent and adopted a wait-and-see approach, resulting in small fluctuations. In the early morning, foreign news reported that the London spot and forward exchange rates rose sharply by 1.6875 pence, and the New York silver price also increased by 2.15. However, the forward exchange rate at the Gold Exchange fell by 0.015, and the British pound and U.S. dollar exchange rates continued to fall by 0.125 and 0.0775, respectively. Private telegraph rates also contracted by 0.1875. The gross rate opened at 44.5 yuan, with Fuchang advancing. Then, it rose, once reaching 58.9 yuan. Ruixing slightly sold off, and the opening price was 951 yuan. The exchange market opened with the British pound weak and the U.S. dollar strong, causing the gold market to wander over a short distance. It first rose to 55 yuan and then retreated to 44 yuan, all following the bank's internal market prices up and down. Afterwards, the market became even more stable. The first telegram from Bombay reported a small increase of 5 annas, and the bank's appetite slightly increased, causing it to rise, but it eventually retreated (the second telegram from Bombay reported a small decrease of 3 annas, which had no impact). The closing price was 950 yuan. Although there was news throughout the day, it had no significant impact. The cost of raw gold was calculated to increase by 36 yuan, and the actual transaction cost was calculated to increase by 39 yuan, with a swap premium of 24 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 951 yuan, rising 13.5 yuan compared to the previous close. Commodities opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with the British pound weak and the U.S. dollar strong. The spot selling price for the British pound was 2 shillings 3.25 pence, and the U.S. dollar was 23.687 yuan. Hengxing, Yuanmao, and Yongsheng first came to sell, and it retreated from 51.5 yuan to 48 yuan. Dadecheng bought in, and Hengyu, Fuyu, Zhaofeng, and Changfuchang all purchased. Hua Bi also bought U.S. dollars for June at 1.125, and it rose to 55.5 yuan. Ruixing sold off, Hua Bi came out with U.S. dollars for May at 0.6875, Shunli also sold, and it retreated to 0.5 yuan. Hongli set a limit price to buy, and Daxingyong also accepted, returning to 3.5 yuan. Datong canceled U.S. dollars for July at 0.1875, and Shunli sold again, dropping to 49.5 yuan. Although Bingxing accepted, it pulled up 2 yuan, but because HSBC came out with U.S. dollars for July at 0.25, and Fuyu repeatedly sold, Wanxing also sold. HSBC's listed price showed an increase of 0.25 for the British pound and a contraction of 0.125 for the U.S. dollar, but the gold price was difficult to sustain, retreating to within 47 yuan. U.S. dollars for August at 0.5 yuan were difficult to sell, and Qingfei Yong sold again, around 5 yuan. Hengyu, Zhaofeng, Changneixing came to buy, and it returned to 3 yuan. Macgary and Citibank both came out with U.S. dollars for July at 0.375, Qianchangxiang sold off, gradually dropping to 44 yuan. Afterwards, it gradually became calm and mostly hovered. After entering, because U.S. dollars for August at 0.5625 were difficult to settle, Hengyu and Bingxing both bought in, raising it to 8.5 yuan. The Central Bank canceled U.S. dollars for May at 0.9375, and Daxingyong Fuyu slightly sold off, retreating again to 5 yuan. Yuanmao also sold off at this time. HSBC bought U.S. dollars for July at 0.375, Dadecheng bought in and gradually rose, and the sentiment suddenly stabilized. Zhifeng, Yongfu, and Chang even advanced to 52 yuan. Shortly after, the noon closing price was 50.02 yuan. After the closing, Hengxing and others slightly sold off, retreating to within 49 yuan. Commodities were bid at 49.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 949.5 yuan, and commodities opened at 50 yuan. Macgary came out with shillings for June at 0.375, and it retreated from 0.7 yuan to 49.4 yuan (commodities continued to accept, reaching 0.8 yuan, Hua).</p>
<p>came out with British gold for the current month at 0.875, and Fuchang sold off, still retreating to within 50 yuan. Fuyu slightly sold off, dropping to 48 yuan. Yuanchun bought in and returned to over 9 yuan. Transactions were extremely small. When Yuntong and Macgary traded U.S. dollars for July at 0.3125, Dadecheng bought in again, pulling it to over 50 yuan. Shortly after, U.S. dollars for July at 0.3125 were difficult to settle, Fuyu bought in, reaching 52 yuan. At this time, the exchange market slightly tightened, and U.S. dollars for June at 0.0625 and July at 0.25 were difficult to settle. Yuanmao, Yongfu, Changhengyu scrambled to buy in, and Daxingyong also came to buy in, pushing it up to 54 yuan. However, this price was difficult to obtain, with only a few transactions, because Hua Bi and Macgary both hoarded U.S. dollars for August at 0.5 yuan, and Bombay also telegraphed a drop of 5 annas. Then, U.S. dollars for August at 0.5 yuan suddenly became difficult to sell. Daxingyong bought in and then sold off, Yuanxingyong and Xiangfeng also sold, dropping to 0.05 yuan. Bingxing, Yifengyong still bought in, improving to over 3 yuan. HSBC canceled U.S. dollars for July at 0.25, gradually declining, and HSBC continued to cancel. Yongfeng came to sell off, immediately retreating to within 1 yuan. Fuchang and Qianchangxiang also sold, reporting 48.5 yuan, due to unfavorable conditions. Bingxing still bought in, and it was still able to recover. The closing price was 950 yuan. After the closing, Yuanmao Yong bought in, and rumors were also good, causing it to rise in price to around 54 yuan, so commodities were bid at 52 yuan. The highest price for the day was 955.5 yuan, and the lowest was 944 yuan, with a fluctuation of 12.5 yuan. As a result, it rose 12.5 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price was calculated based on HSBC Bank's U.S. dollar listing price contracting by 0.125 to 23.25 yuan, with the alloy price being 1032.26 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was about 82 yuan, less than 7 yuan lower than the previous close. The limit price for the current month was 977 yuan, for May 971 yuan, and for June 950 yuan. The morning replenishment was 971 yuan, the same in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Regarding public bonds (April), Yingfengheng Nian bought in 8, Run Changyong Qianchangxiang Nian 1, Dadecheng 14, Yongfeng 7. The enterers Tongfengheng 90, a total of 91 were sold. The cost of raw gold was calculated to increase by 36 yuan, and the transaction in the hall was extremely quiet, but subsequent transactions were calculated to increase by 39 yuan. Swap (May-June) was posted by Yingfengheng 70, Yongfeng 7, which was posted by Yongfeng, calculated at 24 yuan. The transaction in the hall was quiet. In summary, Hengxing, Wanxing, Shunli, Qingfa Yong, Fuyu, Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, Yongfeng, Yuanxing Yong, Yuanmao, etc. all sold, while Bingxing, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Zhifeng Yong, Daxingyong, Yuanchun, Yuanheng, Hengyu, etc. all bought in. Fuchang Daxingyong bought in first and then sold off. Yifengyong Yuanmao Yong Ruixing sold off first and then bought in. Dalian and Guangfeng both sold out. There are still 105 notes left for April, 11,235 for May, and 25,984 for June.</p>

<p>Chinese Merchants Delivery 15.61 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Goods also About 5 Million</p>
<p>Most of the Receivers Belong to the Financial Sector and the North Gang</p>
<p>Yesterday was the date for the delivery of the Chinese Merchants Securities and Goods Exchanges' April public debt. Retracing back to the April futures, it started trading on February 25th and has been in the market for two months since. The range of ups and downs in the market price during this period was not very large. Let's take the salt tax as a standard comparison, and the rest can be inferred by analogy. According to the salt tax in April, the initial opening price was 37 yuan, and the final market price on April 25th was 42.9 yuan, an increase of 5.9 yuan. Among them, there were sudden rises and falls. The highest price was 44.8 yuan on the morning of March 32nd, and the lowest price was 36.3 yuan on the morning of March 1st. The highest and lowest difference was 8.5 yuan. The situation from the overall observation was gradually , which is worthy of a good start. Moreover, after its market price exceeded the 40 yuan mark since March 13th, it only returned to 40 yuan twice, on March 21st and April 19th, but it still exceeded it in a very short period of time. The reason for the former was the emergency in Pingjin, and the latter was the successive loss of Qindao and Luan Dong counties. In the face of this serious national crisis and the danger in North China, the debt market has not had any special changes, which is enough to gauge the stability of bond investors' attitudes. 2.5 is also created by speculators. Under this extremely bad environment, speculators use it to go short, and capitalists use it to collect goods. With a little persistence and strength , the result of the struggle is finally able to overcome the environment, with stable hearts and strong strength. There is no other way than these two. Most of the buying and selling comes from the financial sector, the North Gang and the Guangdong Gang. The forces are quite concentrated. Although there are many scattered accounts coming in and out, they are too scattered and easily shaken. Due to the insecurity of the situation and the rising waves of market prices, speculators' interest has been aroused, so taking just one month of April as an example, from beginning to end, the total number of transactions totaled 18,596 yuan, of which speculators and investment speculators amounted to more than 129 million. The actual number of deliveries yesterday was 15.61 million yuan. The number of those who mutually delivered by their own brokers was approximately 123 million yuan. The number of goods deliveries was also approximately 5 million yuan. Most of those who lend money belong to the financial sector and the North Gang, and those who hedge also account for one-third. The number of April deliveries and transfers is listed separately on the left (unit: hundred yuan)</p>

<p>Yarn sales have turned sluggish again. Because of the economic downturn, all gangs have no active purchasing power. According to reports, more than 200 businesses in Chaoshan have closed down, and the loss of silver has exceeded 1 million yuan. This situation is very unfavorable to the yarn market, because Shantou and Xiamen are the main destinations for selling our yarn. Therefore, people's minds are calm, and the current yarn market price is trending down. At present, although a portion of the period yarn is being absorbed in anticipation of a rise, the thick bottom goods, the bad environment, the consumption situation, and the market are ultimately difficult to rise. According to statistics, all gangs bought a total of 210 bales for the whole day, and the price fell by 5 角 角. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows,</p>
<p>Sichuan 100 Ningbo Shantou 13 Anqing 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 160 Hankou 2 Inland 10 Peers 15</p>
<p>The cotton market is very flat, and there is little demand for existing cotton. All factories are implementing reduced work, and it is natural to use less raw materials, so the amount of business is especially shallow. The source is estimated to be 230 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>

<p>Yarn 4,250 bales price 186 yuan</p>
<p>Cotton 12,800 piculs price 41.5 yuan</p>
<p>The yarn for April was launched on November 1 last year, with a price of 146 taels and 5 qian. Later, at the end of the year, the Sichuan gang had a slight need, and the general public expected a red plate to rise, and the market price was slightly higher, to more than 148 taels. Later, due to the fall of Yuguan and the emergency in Pingjin, people's minds were not good, and the market declined. Moreover, the war clouds in North China were vast, the domestic rural areas were bankrupt, the people were poor and the wealth was exhausted, and spring sales could not rise. From 1445 taels, it fell straight to more than 133 taels. It was delayed until the 6th of this month when the National Government ordered that all transaction prices should be changed to national currency, and standard yarn was changed to silver yuan for bidding. At the same time, because the factory's inventory was accumulating and sales were not moving, manufacturers convened a meeting to reduce work, which caused people's minds to slightly return to high, the highest was 193.5 yuan, the price rose, and some manufacturers closed out long positions. Now sales have stopped, and the Wuxi factory has consistently said it will reduce work, and the decline is sharp, the lowest was once seen at 182 yuan. Later, at the end of the month, Ningbo Fengchang factory was short 500 bales of goods, and due to transportation reasons, they could not be delivered in time, so they were offset. The market price rose by 2 yuan. As a result, there were 4,250 bales left, and the delivery price was 186 yuan. The goods included 300 bales of 20-count picking cotton, 50 bales of Ren Zhong, 150 bales of Dragon Boat, and 100 bales of Song. The rest were all self-delivered.</p>
<p>The cotton for April was launched on November 1 last year, with a price of 31 taels 6 qian and a half. At the end of the year, the last estimate of domestic cotton production was reduced, the harvest year was not good, the sources from all routes were declining, and the price of gold rose, causing people's minds to be agitated. The highest was once seen at 24 taels 56 qian. Later, in the middle of February this year, the Indian cotton market fell sharply, losing 20 rupees, and the yarn market became unstable again, and the price decline started again. The lowest was once seen at 30 taels 8 qian. It was delayed until April 6 when the bidding was changed to silver coins, at 42 yuan 56 角 角. U.S. cotton was for currency inflation, the price of silver rose greatly, and the price of goods rose, but after calculating the silver plate, the price of foreign cotton was cheaper, and at the same time, the yarn market showed a low peak, the lowest was seen at 40 yuan 09 角 角. As a result, the delivery price was 41.5 yuan, and the delivery volume totaled 12,800 piculs. The goods were mostly Tianjin coarse cotton, and there was also fine cotton.</p>

<h3 id="e279">Silk and Tea: New Information on Tea Markets in Zhejiang and Jiangxi <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>Suian: The green tea of Suichun has been selling well in recent years due to strong sales both to foreign and domestic merchants. Business is still considered decent. Last year, the offered price even increased to 94 yuan per dan. This year, the local mountain producers are deeply concerned that tea sales may be sluggish, so they are generally harvesting early to prevent price drops. If the weather turns favorable in the coming days, tea plucking and processing will begin. The number of tea firms setting up in the various villages is about the same as last year. However, the policy of each firm is to reduce mountain prices first to lower costs, taking that as the fundamental requirement, to avoid a repeat of the crisis as the overseas market price has not yet returned to a good state. Whether the mountain price can be lowered will depend on whether the trend in Hangzhou and Shanghai domestic markets is active or sluggish.</p>
<p>Xiushui: The black tea of Xiushui used to have prosperous business. In the last ten years, due to the deteriorating soil quality and the lack of cultivation by mountain producers, the tea leaf production has been poor, leading to a sharp decline in trade with foreign merchants. Production has also decreased significantly compared to the past. The year before last, there were still more than ten firms such as Zhongxin Chang that went into the mountains to provide funds for the black tea business. Because it was difficult to make a profit, the number of firms decreased again last year compared to the year before. According to Xunxun, it is said that the number of foreign firms setting up shop for black tea in the area this year is still uncertain. Generally, due to the tight credit, many are taking a wait-and-see approach. In the future, the number of those who proceed with the tea business will be small. However, smaller merchants and peddlers have already entered the mountains to collect raw tea leaves. The market is even more sluggish than before.</p>
<p>Fuliang: Fuliang tea leaves are divided into red and green tea. This year, tea trees in the eastern and southern villages have had slower bud development due to rainy and cold weather. As of this week, the early tea in Zhouyuan, Qingzui [place names], has begun to bud. Yesterday and today, the weather has cleared up and turned warmer, and the tea is ready for plucking. Mountain producers in various villages believe that local firms have decreased significantly this year, sales are sluggish, and market prices are naturally lower than before. The new prices for Mao Feng green tea at local shops are selling for 70-80 yuan per dan, so most producers are selling directly to the shops to get a good price. If the weather remains clear and rainless, new Mao Feng products will soon be available on the market.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Sunny and Warm Weather Brings a Turning Point for Zhejiang Sericulture <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>Xiaoshi is a well-known silk reeling area in Zhejiang province. Silk shops and silk trading firms are everywhere. Farmers all plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms as important agricultural activities. Every spring silkworm season, the mulberry fields are as lush and green as clouds. This year, the weather was cold, and mulberry trees sprouted slowly. Coupled with the rural economic panic, the silkworm season was late, and raising silkworms was not prosperous. Most of those who hatched native silkworm eggs feared the early silkworm season would follow last year's pattern, and most leaves were left to cold rain. Therefore, everyone raised late silkworms to compensate. After collecting the silkworm ants, the weather was still cold, alternating between sunny and rainy, and the silkworm ants did not develop well. Occasionally, some raised improved breeds. But when the weather turned sunny, with gentle breezes and warm sunshine, the silkworm ants thrived. However, the silkworm seasons varied: early silkworms had already undergone three molts and were consuming leaves, the next group had undergone two molts and had consumed leaves for four or five days, and the late silkworms had only undergone their first molt. The current situation is quite good, and sericulture can still be salvaged.</p>
<p>Deqing is also a major sericulture producing area in Huzhou. However, in recent years, farmers have been very discouraged due to repeated failures in raising silkworms. This year, Zhejiang is providing subsidies to encourage sericulture. Therefore, farmers who plant mulberry trees in Donghengli, Xintang Township, Dama Township, and other places are engaged in hatching silkworms. However, due to abnormal weather conditions, the climate was winter-like, and the mulberry trees produced leaves later, making the silkworm season also later. In the Xiagao and Xu areas, only 30-40% of the native silkworm eggs hatched due to the cold and rain. The later batches of foreign silkworms hatched in Xintang and other places have recently seen good weather and have been harvested completely. Currently, the early batches have been consuming leaves for five or six days, and the late batches have just begun to try leaves. Development is still good.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market was unusually quiet. Although New York rose by two points and Yokohama rose by twenty yuan, transactions were scarce. The reason for this is that, firstly, overseas customers are also uncertain about the silk market and are currently in a wait-and-see mode. Secondly, Shanghai exporters are finding that the quality of the spot goods they purchase often varies, making it difficult to judge. Reuters' silk market report stated that demand for spot transactions in New York was still strong last week, but transactions were slow. Furthermore, silk purchased at low prices previously has reappeared on the market. This week, silk prices rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per yard, but some goods did not increase in price. The appetite of crepe manufacturers is not large, but retail crepe de chine is still considered decent. The silk market at the exchange is still good, and artificial silk prices have also risen slightly. The prices in overseas markets are as follows (27th):</p>
<p>Market Grade Price Exchange Rate National Currency</p>
<p>New York Standard Silk 1.48 24.25 760</p>
<p>London Hua Silk A 7 shillings 9 pence 1.625 725</p>
<p>Hua Silk B 7 shillings 3 pence 1.3.625 673</p>
<p>Lyon Hua Silk A 89 francs 565 805</p>
<p>Hua Silk B 83.5 francs 565 751</p>
<h3 id="e282">Grain: Northern Merchants Continue to Handle Southern Rice <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Approximately 2,500 to 2,600 Bags, Prices Rise by Several Cents</p>
<p>(Shanghai South): Yesterday's arrivals included Chang Firm No. 2, Su Tong Firm No. 9, Qingjiao Firm No. 7, Sijing No. 3, Songjiang No. 7, Xi Lian Tang No. 5, Pinghu No. 2, and Nanhang Firm No. 6, totaling more than 40 firms. The market situation was normal in the morning and then improved. Local merchants were active and had strong demand. Therefore, sellers seized the opportunity to raise prices, and the situation appeared quite lively. Customers with high demand, such as Northern merchants from Tangshan Yantai and Weihaiwei, as well as the Mige [probably a typo] army from Huai and Luan Dong [region], were eager to purchase, as the situation was stable. A total of 22 loads of thin rice, including Qingjiao 7 loads, Sijing 3 loads, Songjiang 7 loads, and Xi Lian Tang 5 loads, were sold, totaling approximately 2,500 to 2,600 bags. Southern Xinghua merchants also procured 400 to 500 bags, resulting in a sudden surge. Prices increased by several cents to more than a dime. Duyangjian [brand name] was popular and increased by five cents. Chang rice remained stable at 1 yuan, while Yuan rice saw normal sales. Fortunately, there was a shortage of goods, so prices remained firm at five cents.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North): Yesterday, there were only a few ships arriving, about a dozen in number. White rice was not in demand, high-quality rice was hard to sell, and medium-quality rice was hard to move. The medium-quality rice was slightly discounted. Therefore, when there were few rice arrivals, the price was tight, nearing a dime, while rice remained stable. There was no change in the market, and transactions were on credit.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Foreign Rice is Selling Actively <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>Prices Rise by Five Cents to a Dime or More</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation was good. The foreign rice stored in Hankou, which had previously been returned, was sold in full, totaling four thousand bags. There was no floating stock on the market. Foreign merchants intended to sell, but they all set very high price limits, making it difficult to reach an agreement. Therefore, the market sentiment gradually improved. Yesterday, 1,200 bags of small-grain rice from Fuzhou were sold at 8.43 to 8.47 yuan, which was five cents higher than the previous market price. Fuzhou merchants had a strong demand. In addition to glutinous rice, the demand for foreign rice was also very good, but because the owners set too high a price limit, sales were not smooth. Therefore, transactions were not high. Market prices rose by five to six cents to ten cents or more. A total of 1,150 bags of rice from Jiang [place name] were sold, with high-quality rice priced at 8.533 to 8.54 yuan, and general-quality rice at 8.12 to 7.90 yuan. In addition, 118 bags of machine-milled red rice were sold at 8 yuan, 677 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice were sold at 8.65 to 8.62 yuan, and 219 bags of polished oil rice were sold at 8.07 yuan. Furthermore, 1,100 bags of red rice were sold at 7.15 to 7.10 yuan. Among them, about a hundred bags of Xiang oil rice were purchased by Quanzhou merchants, while the rest were purchased by merchants from Fuzhou. The market sentiment was very strong for Fujianese demand, and everyone was optimistic about the prices of the rice.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Flour Market Remains Stable Before Delivery <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month's market showed signs of being weak for distant months and stable for near months. Although foreign prices were reported to be about 3 cents higher, market sentiment should have improved. However, because this month was the last day of trading, there was more floating stock outside the industry, and everyone was closing out positions. Therefore, the lowest price was 2.4405 yuan, the lowest record since the change to foreign currency. Following expectations that large factories were unwilling to release their stock and small lots had already been sold off, the market situation was not good, but the opening price was stable. When the afternoon session opened, it was easy to close out positions for this month, and the market initially remained flat. Then, because some traders in the market made small purchases to cover their short positions, the market stabilized. Transactions for distant months remained scarce, and prices remained stable. Because there was no one selling for September, the market was the most stable. As a result, the market for this month was 2.5 cents higher than the previous day, the May market was unchanged, the June, July, and August markets were up 2.5 cents, and the September market was up 5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Forward New Wheat Prices Uniformly Look Lower <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market presented a situation of being quiet for the near term and active for the distant term. This month has passed, and the amount for delivery has not yet been cleared. The large transactions were all made off the exchange. Due to the continuous reports of low prices for foreign wheat and the recent clear weather, the prospects for new wheat are expected to be good. Therefore, everyone is uniformly looking lower. Domestic sales have gradually become smooth, and foreign wheat traders have also been actively hedging. Therefore, the market sentiment has taken a sharp turn for the worse. As a result, there was no comparison for May and June, the July market was down 2 cents, the August market was down 3 cents, and the September market was down 4 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Only the Vehicle Bean Factory is Prosperous <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market sold a total of 17 or 18 vehicles of Zhengyangguan beans, and Dachang Factory traded 16 vehicles. The initial market price was 5 yuan, but because the buying momentum was strong, sellers were reluctant to sell. However, the factory was unwilling to buy at a high price, so it did not increase the price enough. Although one factory purchased 16 vehicles, the price was 5.10 to 5.14 yuan. There were also a few vehicles purchased by exporters, with the price set at 5.145 yuan. One vehicle of Tancheng beans was traded at 5.10 yuan and was also purchased by the factory. The vehicle bean market is temporarily stable.</p>

<p>Chicago (27th): Chicago wheat rose initially due to speculative buying, then fell due to selling. The trading volume yesterday was 60 million bushels. Market prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Price Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>May 67.5 Down 0.875</p>
<p>July 67.875 Down 0.625</p>

<p>Since the United States restored the gold standard, foreign exchange has been easing in this port, thus affecting the sales of various goods in the market and trending towards loosening. Yesterday, tinplate fell by more than 20 cents, estimated at 10 yuan (90 lbs) and 19.5 yuan (100 lbs). Pig lead fell by 15 cents, selling for 16 yuan. Galvanized iron fell by a few cents, selling for 1.5 yuan. New steel bars of sizes 13 and 14 also fell by 20 to 30 cents. The cheapest price was 18.5 yuan per dan. In addition, new lead wire, galvanized iron sheets, English steel plates, and other items were all declining. However, actual transactions were increasingly rare.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Slightly Fall <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the premium rose slightly, sugar sales remained slow, and the trend was weak. The public market quoted a preliminary price of 20.3 yuan for 24 grade raw white sugar. Later, a firm offered 500 bags of spot goods at 4.15 Dutch guilders based on new regulations, which, including all outside expenses, only amounted to 20.02 yuan, a decrease of 1 cent. Number 20 medium white sugar was quoted at 20 yuan, while eight-degree Dutch red sugar was quoted at 16 yuan. There were no transactions. Chaoqing red and Meinan red were also not offered. Only Huizhou white sugar saw some sales. The color was slightly inferior, and the price was 18.6 yuan.</p>

<p>(Starches) Recently, business with out-of-town clients has been slow for a long time, and merchants have accumulated large inventories. Although they want to sell, there are no buyers. Furthermore, foreign producing markets have been reporting frequent price declines, so prices in Shanghai have also been gradually decreasing. Currently, prices in the market are: Renqiang Brand, 12 yuan; Flying Kylin, 11 yuan; Deer Brand, 10.9 yuan; XXX, 10.4 yuan; Cow Brand, 10.02 yuan; National Flag Brand, 9.6 yuan; Green Tower Brand, 9.5 yuan; Red Three Fish, 9.3 yuan; Black Three Fish, 3.3 yuan; Hand Brand, 3 yuan. The market is generally sluggish. Unless out-of-town sales revive, it will be difficult to see good times in the near future.</p>
<p>(Dried Vegetables) High-quality goods like Lion's Mane and West Lan [place names] are currently out of stock. However, the supply of Dragon Bud is still strong. Yesterday's prices were: New Guang goods, 11.5 to 11 yuan; medium-quality goods, 8.4 to 7.8 yuan; low-quality goods, 6.7 yuan. Demand is still brisk. All 113 bags that arrived were sold.</p>

<h3 id="e291">Civilization and Humanity <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>It is said that we are now in a civilized world, and humans are civilized. For example, Europeans and Americans often pride themselves on being from civilized countries, while upper-class Chinese people and civilized gentlemen often scold those "uncivilized" lower-class Chinese as "barbarians." "Barbarian" happens to be the opposite of "civilized."</p>
<p>Civilization means things that make humans enjoy blessings, such as Ford airplanes or Cadillac cars, which are extremely convenient. In addition, there are wool, silk, and cotton clothes, as well as patriotic silk, free spinning, and (September 18th Incident) crepe: food includes Chinese and Western cuisine, delicacies from the sea and mountains; housing includes Chinese, Western, Roman, or Eastern styles, stone or cement buildings: Although humans cannot universally enjoy the blessings of civilization, civilization has already penetrated everywhere: some people are suffering from civilization, but some are enjoying the blessings of civilization. Therefore, some people, after making a living, still "play mahjong," fill out "liberation lyrics," or watch fat-bottomed sexy dances to celebrate the success of this civilization.</p>
<p>However, since civilized people scold uncivilized people as "barbarians," this reveals a bit of information: "barbarism" still exists alongside "civilization." Let's take a random example:</p>
<p>Not long ago, a friend was fortunate enough to be released from prison. He said that as soon as he entered the prison, he would be interrogated as usual. During the interrogation, torture would be used, such as sitting on a tiger bench or having tap water poured into his nostrils. He didn't know how others felt when they were tortured, but after he himself was tortured, he didn't feel much pain. He just carefully examined those who interrogated and tortured him for a long time. He always felt something was different and couldn't believe that they were the same human beings as himself. He suspected that they were another kind of fierce beast; but after repeatedly identifying them, they all had the appearance of human beings and wore human clothes. So he began to be surprised at how cruel humans could be to their own kind and how "barbaric" the world still was.</p>
<p>He entered the prison with this strange feeling and met the prisoners who were detained like him. At first, he was wary of them, because the people who maintained the law were already so cruel, so the lawbreakers must be even worse. Then he saw that they treated him as kindly as they would treat their own family members, and he couldn't help but be suspicious, and his previous feelings began to waver. This made him feel that humans were really "civilized" and approachable. However, as soon as he touched the wounds on his body and felt the pain, he felt that humans were "barbaric" again.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not difficult to understand; humans are originally civilized, but when they are opposed to each other, they become "barbaric."</p>
<p>However, this clearly shows the existence of "barbarism," which is exactly the opposite of "civilization."</p>
<p>Whether or not something is civilized depends on how humans use it to live their lives. This means is nothing more than treating nature and treating one's fellow humans. The former civilization has already brought some happiness to mankind, but the latter is still causing people to suffer, and is still "barbaric."</p>
<p>Water is flowing, and the ships floating on the water are also flowing. If the ship suddenly stops moving, it must have hit a reef or run aground on a beach. So what is it that is hindering half of human civilization?</p>
<p>However, I am not a Christian or a humanitarian, and I have no thought of "humanity" that would inspire me to say this; because, as long as the barbarism and cruelty of mankind are eliminated, even if it means using barbaric and cruel means, I will not regret it at all. Whether it's a donation for saving the country or a donation for aviation, I have generously given.</p>
<p>Humans are already half civilized, and that is in their treatment of nature. If we could remove that half of barbarism towards our fellow humans, not only would civilization be able to universally benefit all living beings, but also the entire human race would be transformed from its original sphinx-like form. However, that is not something that can be explained clearly with reason first.</p>
<p>But I think this time will not be long.</p>

<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>To My Brother (Continued)</p>
<p>I have said things that I have not said, and I have done things that I have not done. And those words and deeds were all contrary to my thoughts. Some people have fabricated various strange stories about my life in tabloids. Some people have used me in (interviews) (impressions), etc., to turn me into someone like them, saying what they think. A short manuscript of mine that was created as a joke a few years ago was signed with my current name and appeared in a memorial publication in Nanyang. A short message I sent to a friend was published in the supplement of an XX organ newspaper. An old manuscript of mine was given by a friend as a gift to an editor. After my article was reprinted by a magazine, the title was changed and advertisements were placed everywhere, making some young friends suspect that I had received a huge fee from that magazine (you know I have never received a single penny from that magazine); during my travels, an editor sent me his work to ask for my criticism, and I faithfully wrote my opinion in a reply, but my letter was deleted and published in the magazine. A translation of mine was taken by a friend who returned from Nanyang to publish. I proofread it myself and negotiated the printing myself. After the book came out, he did not give me a single penny in royalties or pay a single penny in printing costs. Instead, he scolded me behind my back for being stingy with him. Helping him resulted in his bookstore closing down, and the translation fell into the hands of another bookstore editor. That editor wanted me to sell it to him, and for the sake of several friends, I agreed. But now, a year after this small book was published, that editor is taking it to other bookstores to sell, and he is also spreading rumors that I owe him money and have not paid it back, and that I am using the translation as collateral. (There are many more things like this. In this literary world, in this publishing world, there are many things that make a real person bitter, groan, and I don't have time to tell you all of them.) I saw a person say a few words, and so this person connected my words and deeds with him or her and spread them out. I hate all the old bones covered by the name of Eastern culture, but others insist on sending me old poems, while thinking that they understand me very well.</p>
<p>In this way, I have become a tool for young ladies and gentlemen to play with. Not only have my words and deeds been raped, but my thoughts have also been raped several times. My thoughts are the things I cherish most! But others even want to take away this little bit of freedom of thought! But I have not issued a protest in the past two years. I just smile bitterly, I just groan. Because they say they are all my friends.</p>
<p>You don't know how much I hate my name now! Several times in sleepless nights, I violently grabbed my hair and violently beat my chest. Intense hatred tore at my heart, and boundless darkness surrounded me. At that time, I really hoped that there would be a force to destroy myself. I really cannot endure this kind of life anymore. I clearly love my articles, but now my articles have been ruined to the point that I have to hate them. This situation is like a mother seeing her child being ravaged and losing its human form. You should understand that pain too.</p>
<p>Now, no matter what, I should end my past life. In order to be a real and brave person, in order to be loyal to my own beliefs, in order to prevent the day when I would personally cut off my own life, I should stay away from those literati, I should throw myself into real life, and find strength in action, as I hoped in (The Cry of a Dying Soul). This is what I mean by (taking life as a desperate gamble).</p>
<p>Whether I will ever be able to break free from all the encirclement and be reborn, I myself do not know. But I am now</p>
<p>crying out. You are my only brother, and I hope that you will always remember me in danger and hardship and give me blessings! (The End)</p>

<p>— Wen Yuan</p>
<p>The train climbed out of Berlin. The train was full of women and children. There were almost no strong men. In one of the carriages, a gray-haired Landsturm soldier was sitting next to a weak, sick old woman. In the rumbling of the train wheels, passengers could hear her counting: (One, two, three,) clearly completely absorbed in her own thoughts. Every now and then, she repeated these numbers. Two girls giggled at this strange behavior, innocently talking about some unconscious things. An elder frowned and scolded them a few words, and then silence enveloped everything.</p>
<p>(One, two, three,) clearly unconsciously, this woman repeated, and the girls giggled again. At this time, the gray-haired Landsturm soldier leaned forward.</p>
<p>(Ladies,) he said seriously, (if I told you that this poor woman is my wife, I'm afraid you wouldn't laugh anymore. In the war, we lost our three sons. Now, before I go to the front myself, I have to send their mother to an insane asylum.)</p>
<p>The carriage instantly became terribly silent.</p>

<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(22) Memorial to the Emperor by Examination Candidates</p>
<p>Kang Youwei traveled to the capital five times and submitted memorials to the emperor seven times, but it was the memorial by examination candidates that most shocked the world. He once wrote a poem to commemorate the event, saying, "The Eastern affair was defeated, and I united three thousand examination candidates from eighteen provinces to submit a memorial. The next day, the American envoy Denby requested the draft, which was copied and engraved all over the world, titled 'Record of the Memorial to the Emperor by Examination Candidates.'" At that time, the main advocate for peace was Grand Councilor Sun Yujun, who incurred great public anger. Sun, fearing to attend court, resigned his position. The poem says:</p>
<p>The sea dragon weeps as ships sink in the waves,</p>
<p>The senior minister goes out in a light carriage to discuss peace,</p>
<p>The Liaodong territory is about to be carved up and handed over.</p>
<p>Many examination candidates lay prostrate before the palace gates to protest,</p>
<p>Three thousand people signed their names, their carriage wheels rubbing together,</p>
<p>A convoy of five miles blocked the streets.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese people weep and sing of Qin Hui,</p>
<p>Spies and rumors spread throughout the nine cities.</p>
<p>Carrying coffins and clenching fists, they beat the drums three times.</p>
<p>Qin Hui avoids the court, fearing rebuke.</p>
<p>The American envoy Denby is amazed by the morale of the scholars!</p>
<p>He requests the draft to copy and spread, ink vying to be ground all over the world.</p>
<p>Alas! What to do if we cannot smash Qin!</p>
<p>Reading this poem, we can imagine the scale of the movement to petition the emperor and how vigilant the government was. The fact that the prime minister was willing to take responsibility and resign shows that there was still something called "public opinion" at that time. Previously, when the telegram reporting that the peace treaty with Japan, consisting of eleven articles, had been signed by a plenipotentiary official arrived in Beijing, the whole country was in an uproar. Both officials within the central government and local officials outside the capital had arguments. The most vocal and激烈的發言激動者 who spoke out most vehemently were the examination candidates. After completing the examination in the Ministry of Rites, they beat the Dengwen Drum and competed to submit memorials. Initially, more than a hundred Guangdong examination candidates, including Liang Qichao, and dozens of Hunan examination candidates, including Ren Xichun, Wen Junduo, and Tan Shaochang, first went to the Censorate to request that they submit the memorial on their behalf. Then, the provinces of Fujian, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Guizhou followed. Then, the provinces of Jiangsu, Hubei, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Guangxi followed. Then, the provinces of Zhili, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Yunnan followed. From February 28, 30, April 2, 4, 6, etc., on the days when the Censorate held its bi-daily court sessions, the outside of the gate was filled with the clamor of carriages and horses, officials in their robes mingled together, the discussions were heated, and the shouting reverberated through the sky. After several days of not receiving a response to the memorials, the examination candidates from various provinces united again and submitted another memorial, with Guangdong examination candidate Kang Youwei (Zuyi) in charge. The memorial was long (more than eighteen thousand words), beginning with "We, examination candidates Kang Zuyi, etc., submit this memorial concerning matters of national safety, requesting that a clear decree be issued, with great rewards and punishments, to move the capital, train troops, and reform the laws, in order to block the peace agreement and resist foreign barbarians, protect our territory, and extend the life of the nation, requesting that you submit this memorial on our behalf." It stated that the Emperor should issue a decree to boost the morale of the nation, move the capital to establish the foundation of the nation, train troops to strengthen the power of the nation, and reform the laws to achieve good governance of the nation. To boost the morale of the nation, they suggested issuing a decree of self-reproach, a decree of clear punishment, and a decree seeking talent. To establish the foundation of the nation, they suggested moving the capital to Chang'an. To strengthen the power of the nation, they suggested selecting generals, purchasing weapons, and organizing overseas Chinese troops. To achieve good governance of the nation, they suggested laws for enriching the nation, such as currency laws, railroads, machinery and steamships, mining, silver coinage, and postal services. They also suggested laws for nurturing the people, such as promoting agriculture, encouraging industry, providing for merchants, and caring for the poor. To care for the poor, they suggested resettlement, vocational training, and providing for the destitute. They also suggested laws for educating the people, such as dividing the civil service examination into literary and artistic subjects and abolishing military subjects, establishing libraries everywhere, encouraging newspapers, and promoting morality. Finally, they suggested laws for reforming the political system, such as reducing redundant officials, decreasing stipends, storing up talent, sending students abroad, selecting advisory officials, and recruiting civilian soldiers. They concluded by saying that if everything were renewed and we used the land of two million square miles, the four hundred million people, and the two hundred and sixty thousand kinds of products to strive for self-strengthening, then this would be a great worry for Japan and a secret concern for the countries of Europe. If we hesitate, delay, muddle along, cling to the old ways, and miss the opportunity, then the various foreign powers will surround us, leaving no room for escape, and even a sage would be unable to improve the situation. After the draft was completed, it was circulated for discussion at the Jiancao Hall in the Songjun Hermitage south of Xuanwu City, the former residence of the Ming official Yang Jiaoshan. The peace agreement was originally scheduled to be exchanged in Yantai on April 14, so the official memorial was also scheduled to be submitted to the Censorate on the 10th, with the 7th, 8th, and 9th being the dates for the meeting. However, the envoy who negotiated the peace and the minister who advocated for it, fearing that public sentiment would be turbulent and the situation would change, hastily requested on the 8th that the peace agreement be sealed and sent with the envoy. Alas, the memorial was not submitted, but the agreement was already finalized, and it was only seen that this grand document was copied and engraved all over the world. What was the point?</p>

<p>— Written by Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Rabbit</p>
<p>"(There's no watermelon left for you,)" Mrs. Lepic said; "(Actually, you're like me, you don't like watermelon.)" "(Of course,)" Carrot Hair thought.</p>
<p>His tastes were completely arranged by others. Generally speaking, he could only take his mother's tastes as his own. When eating cheese:</p>
<p>"(I believe Carrot Hair definitely won't eat it,)" Mrs. Lepic said.</p>
<p>"(Since she believes I definitely won't eat it, there's no need to try it.)"</p>
<p>Besides, he knew it was dangerous.</p>
<p>But even if he didn't try it, didn't he have a chance to satisfy his quirks in a place only he knew? When the last dish of the meal was served, Mrs. Lepic said to him:</p>
<p>"(Take these few slices of eaten watermelon to your rabbits.)"</p>
<p>Carrot Hair slowly walked to do the chore, holding the plate level, so as not to spill the contents.</p>
<p>When he walked into the rabbit's hutch, the rabbits were so happy that they jumped around, their ears stood up high, their noses facing the sky, their front feet stretched straight, as if preparing to beat a drum, everyone crowded around him.</p>
<p>"(Ah! Wait a minute, Carrot Hair said;)" (Slow down a bit, let's all share.)"</p>
<p>He sat on a pile of dirt and wild chrysanthemum roots, cabbage heads, sunflower leaves and the like. He fed the watermelon seeds to the rabbits, and drank the melon juice himself: it was as sweet as sweet wine.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he scraped the sweet yellow pulp left over by the people at home with his teeth, eating everything that could still be dissolved, and then threw the green hard skin to the rabbits standing on their hind legs around him.</p>
<p>The door of the rabbit hutch was closed.</p>
<p>The midday sun, lazily leaking through the cracks in the tiles, dipped its tail of light in the cool shadows.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Aviation and Air Defense <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>Not long ago, I wrote something about (aviation to save the country), advocating that while everyone is shouting (donate money to buy airplanes), in addition to everyone should take out money (in fact, this is fundamentally impossible, but there is simply no way otherwise), we must also actively train flight and combat personnel, set up factories to manufacture airplanes, and explore for gasoline, because if these three problems are not solved first, then the throats of the people of the country will be hoarse, or even if the (bought) airplanes are so numerous that there is no place to put them, the (country) will still not be (saved), and it will also create a new and greater crisis,</p>
<p>But what is equally important as (aviation) and must also be arranged at the same time as (aviation) is (air defense). When we open the former Japanese newspapers, we find two news items about our enemies' air force on the second page,</p>
<p>(1) They are actively training for long-distance combat over a 5,000-kilometer round trip from Hamamatsu to Taiwan.</p>
<p>(2) Yoshihiro Yoshida, a retired soldier, has invented a precisely constructed (light anti-aircraft gun). It is reported that this new type of weapon has six gun barrels, and it automatically determines the standard for objects moving at high speeds such as airplanes and can fire freely.</p>
<p>From these two news items, we can see that the enemy is working hard on the offensive and defensive training and equipment for air combat. If we look around at the countries that have airplanes, there is no country that is not studying (air defense) plans, and no country that is not trying its best to (air defense) drills. But what about ourselves? (Just buying airplanes!) (Just buying airplanes!) It seems that as soon as an airplane is (bought), the (country) will not only be (saved) by this (purchase), but also the enemy planes will flee at the mere sight of us. May I ask how can such a flustered state be expressed in color, and how can it not give the enemy reason to laugh at me as an unorganized country?</p>
<p>Some people say that China does not need to use airplanes at all, because China has people who can (fly). Look, didn't the newspaper a few days ago, with fancy borders, say that a certain chairman is recruiting talents who can walk on walls? Above the (eaves and walls) one can (fly away), of course one can take to the air and fly; is not being able to fly in the air the same effect as an airplane? Therefore, the Chinese people do not need to spend money to buy airplanes from foreigners, and of course they do not need to talk about (air defense), because people are alive and agile, they can move at will in the air, and they can fly on the enemy's airplanes and cut off the enemy's wing blades with a (big knife) to make them ineffective. Isn't this much cleaner than so-called (air defense)! Therefore, it proves that the chairman's intentions are good,</p>
<p>However, this is ultimately nonsense, a joke of the world, but it can also be seen that the leisurely sentiments and uselessness of the Chinese people are incomparable to the enemy's scheming, insidious, and viciousness.</p>
<p>But empty talk about (aviation), or blindly (donating money to buy airplanes), its uselessness and leisurely sentiment are also likely to have the same wonderful effect, so I say,</p>
<p>(1) Rather than not train flight and combat personnel, it is better to simply give the (bought) airplanes to the enemy, lest we waste resources and be laughed at by the people of the world,</p>
<p>(2) Rather than not manufacture airplanes and gasoline ourselves, it is better for the people of the country to simply remit the money they are preparing to donate to foreign countries (to buy airplanes) to foreign countries to show respect to foreigners, lest a group of (enthusiastic to save the country) adults and gentlemen work hard and hurt their hearts,</p>
<p>(3) Without (air defense), one simply does not need to (aviation), and the (country) may simply not need to be (saved), otherwise it is equivalent to taking (bought) airplanes unconditionally to be a living target for the enemy's (light anti-aircraft guns), or honestly like young Marshal Zhang to generously give hundreds of airplanes to the enemy to paint them and bomb the lives and properties of our Chinese people,</p>

<p>For no reason, I feel the dust calamity drifting,</p>

<h3 id="e298">Strive <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Kuang</p>
<p>"Strive" is such an inauspicious word. If one does not have the fortune to possess things on one's own, but can only rely on striving to find a way, then it is no wonder that the gentlemen of ancient times, the Buddhist monks who folded their hands and chanted "Amitabha," and the Lord Jesus, who said, "If someone strikes you on the left cheek, offer them the right also," have always despised and opposed it. Unexpectedly, those who love to strive come up with a plan, changing the appearance of the word, but its inner meaning remains the same. For example, "competing for supremacy," "chasing the deer," (:::) are all examples of this.</p>
<p>Striving is indeed not a threshold. Just look at the sighs of the ancients: "Fighting for land leads to war, killing fills the fields; fighting for a city leads to war, killing fills the city." Using striving to cause killing to fill (fields and cities), its crime is truly heinous. Therefore, philosophers who opposed striving emerged, creating philosophies that said: "Gentlemen value ritual, petty men value striving." In Western Europe, there was also such a sage, whom everyone probably knows, Prince Kropotkin, the founder of anarchism, who wrote a book called "Mutual Aid," strongly advocating the idea of non-striving. This book has long been translated in China. I remember that in Beijing there was once a solicitation for (Ten Essential Books for Young People), and some scholars and celebrities selected this "Mutual Aid." I don't know why, but it offended Mr. Marx, who seemed like a flood or a fierce beast, and he wrote a famous book called "The Poverty of Philosophy," which refuted Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid." He not only criticized Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid," but also thoroughly advocated class struggle, which is the ultimate form of striving.</p>
<p>Therefore, the word "strive" cannot be destroyed after all, and the way of striving becomes more widespread, and the facts of striving become ubiquitous.</p>
<p>If others bully me, I will not submit and will appeal to the court. When the court opens, there will inevitably be a (struggle to reason). Even now, when countries occasionally resort to arms, weaker countries, fearing confusion, also appeal to (international courts) (League of Nations). This not only requires (struggling to reason), but it is said that it also requires (struggling to uphold justice). If the arm is about to be broken! Qing Yong made</p>
<p>If one cannot win even in court, one can only bear the injustice and go to the public to struggle, like the case of the female fortune-teller Wen Ying, who was murdered. Her mother, dissatisfied with the court's verdict, carried an appeal to Beijing some time ago, petitioning various judicial organs, and it is said that it has been quite effective.</p>
<p>Extending this to the rich and powerful families (with food stretching a square foot in front of them and numerous concubines), the struggles between the wives and concubines for the husband often lead to torn clothes and pants, and even the sight of short knives, broken heads. There is indeed such a set of struggles between wives and concubines.</p>
<p>Extending this to two men chasing after one woman, or two women chasing after one man, there is inevitably a scene of (competing for superiority), and it is said that the element of striving is the strongest because the jealousy is too deep. Therefore, even someone as weak as Tao Sijin, in order to possess the writer Xu Qinwen, used a kitchen knife to cut off five inches of Liu Mengying's beautiful neck, causing herself to eat Si Guan even now.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are men of letters and scholars who, when they are so poor that they have no way to praise themselves, will also come up with two or three sentences of (struggling for life) (the word "挣" originally came from the word "争") or a set of (struggling for freedom of speech), but these two are quite difficult to strive for.</p>
<p>Speaking of our noble country, people love to haggle over one or two copper coins with rickshaw pullers, often arguing until their faces are red and twitching, and they dare not give way even slightly.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there was (the snipe and the clam fought, and the fisherman benefited), and now the general military and politicians are playing this game in full swing. The four northeastern provinces may be occupied by Japanese soldiers, but internal strife cannot be stopped. One scene after another is being shown before our eyes. Often, after a period of internal strife, there will be a period of peace, and then another period of internal strife, cycling up and down, succeeding and generating each other, resulting in the current situation! The national fortune is declining day by day, and the people are living in poverty.</p>
<p>So, what is the way of striving? I say: In China, it is indeed only like this.</p>
<h3 id="e299">After Reading the (Public Notice for Pacifying the People) in Beiping <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yu</p>
<p>After the defeat in eastern Hebei, the people of Tianjin and Beiping were in a panic. The mayor of Beiping announced a public notice for pacifying the people, saying: (1) The Beiping Public Security Bureau has organized wartime police teams to strengthen vigilance and cooperate with the military to maintain public order. (2) Air defense facilities have been completed. Even if airplanes appear in the skies of Beiping, they will not be able to stay for a long time. (3) The Tianjin-Beiping Railway has been assigned round-the-clock vigilance by the railway police. The enemy's conspiracies will definitely not be realized, etc. (Actually copied from the late evening edition of the 20th of April) I wonder what the local common people thought after reading it?</p>
<p>I am someone who used to be a common person in Beiping, and every time the civil war came close to Tianjin and Beiping, I read similar notices. At first, I was very skeptical, thinking that if more than 100,000 troops could not resist the (enemy) (?), how could the police resist them? Therefore, my heart became even more (panicked).</p>
<p>I believe that my friends in Shanghai will definitely think that my question is reasonable, or when you read the notice in the newspaper, you had already asked this question before me.</p>
<p>You will definitely think that my question is reasonable, or Actually, later facts told me that this question was wrong.</p>
<p>I have experienced many times in Beiping during times of civil war (panic), so not long after, I knew the meaning of the notice. So, looking at those newly arrived residents who were (panicked) after reading the notice, I found it laughable. Because I had already changed from a small common person to an old common person, so that notice was indeed (pacifying me a lot).</p>
<p>Because experience told me that the situation was like this: the so-called (wartime police team) and the like, in addition to using a gun salute to send the A army out of the back door quietly, also had to use a gun salute to welcome the B army entering from the front door.</p>
<p>After the B army came in, everything was the same as before, except that there were some changes in the newspapers (a new emperor, a new dynasty), those police officers never changed.</p>
<p>The way to (panic) is originally about fearing stray bullets, robbery, and street fighting, so in this way, except for rich merchants who have to send some offerings to welcome and send off, the rest do not need to (panic) much.</p>
<p>Counting my (panicked) experiences, the most noteworthy was when the National Revolutionary Army marched north to Tianjin and Beiping; at that time, the so-called (panic) was still about (internal war) outside of the civil war.</p>
<p>At that time, Tianjin had Zhang Zongchang, and Beiping had Zhang Zuolin, who sent out 100,000 fierce (plainclothes detectives) to detect the so-called (plainclothes teams). At that time, the victory of the Northern Expeditionary Army relied heavily on (plainclothes teams), so expanding (plainclothes detectives) was indeed a way to fight poison with poison. However, (plainclothes teams) appeared and disappeared unpredictably, similar to (Communists), often hiding among young people, and entering and exiting the houses of universities, so we university students were particularly likely to be detected as (plainclothes teams) by (plainclothes detectives). So this (wartime plainclothes detective) was the most (panicked) thing, which was somewhat different from the (wartime police team).</p>
<p>But I still have to go back to the main topic. At that time, there was also a police team that (cooperated with the military). They were awe-inspiring and full of vigor, freely searching everywhere day and night. A house rented together by female students was searched by them many times at night. They must know more than I do, so I don't want to say much here.</p>
<p>But there was an obvious distinction between the crimes brought up by these two. No matter whether the evidence was a red silk scroll (don't laugh, this is a fact, it was once considered a red flag covering the ground), or a small publication sympathizing with the poor, or the Three Principles of the People, or the so-called speeches and will of the late premier; once it fell into the hands of the plainclothes detectives, it became a (plainclothes team), and once it fell into the hands of the (police team cooperating with the military), it immediately became a (Communist); but both were (sentenced to death), this was the same.</p>
<p>However, when the Northern Expeditionary Army entered the city, the first to hang the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Ground was the executive office that had executed people for hiding this kind of flag just the day before.</p>
<p>And the one using the Blue Sky White Sun hat badge was not the undying (plainclothes team), but the police who had executed the (plainclothes team).</p>
<p>Once, I even saw in the police station a police officer who had searched us many times and arrested my friend for hiding the Three Principles of the People, reading a teaching material on the Three Principles of the People; after inquiring, I learned that it was for the purpose of taking the (Party Ideology) exam, which made me suddenly realize everything!</p>
<p>However, all of this is completely different from this (wartime police team), but from this, one thing can be known, that is, their responsibility is not in resisting foreign aggression, but in maintaining public order. What is vigilantly guarded all night is not the (enemy country), but the (enemy country's conspiracies); the (enemy country's conspiracies) are the same as the former (plainclothes teams), that is, (traitors)!</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I suddenly thought of the suggestion in the newspaper that some people would fill Tianjin with a buffer zone. Therefore, the concept of a (buffer police team) could not help but make me (panic).</p>
<p>If it is really the same as what I saw several times during the previous civil wars, then this (public notice for pacifying the people) made me, a small common person in faraway Shanghai, (panic)!</p>
<p>Oh dear! Readers, please forgive me! I suddenly have a splitting headache, my eyes are dizzy, and I see them all taking out (fake flags), putting on (fake hat badges), and holding up (fake righteousness):::::! Forgive me for not being able to write more.</p>

<h3 id="e300">Moving is Difficult <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>I remember when I was in my hometown, helping neighbors and relatives move, I often heard these words: "(It's really not easy for farmers to move! As the saying goes, 'Moving makes you poor for ten years.' This sentence is not wrong at all. When poor people move once, building a small shed costs thirty or twenty! People come to help, and you have to serve them food, which costs at least three or two dollars! Everything is expensive these days, but grain is worthless. Fixing this, fixing that, everywhere costs money! Where does this money come from? Doesn't it all come from those few catties of grain?)"</p>
<p>Yes, moving is really not easy, I understand that very well. Recently, after reading the reports in the newspapers about the Japanese army's atrocities in Rehe, it further proves the correctness of my theory. (::: Women committed suicide due to being raped by Japanese soldiers. Even more tragic was that several pregnant women were stabbed through their abdomens with guns by Japanese soldiers because the Chinese women refused to let the Japanese soldiers take their cattle and sheep. (Author's note: Of course, the children in their abdomens were also stabbed, that's all.)</p>
<p>The vast Chinese people, after suffering such atrocities, why don't they move? Of course, it is because moving is difficult, they don't have money to move, that's right. However, when talking about this, a small note should be added, which is: those who (seek the interests of the people) and those wealthy people who (run around for the country, risking their lives) are exceptions. Because their (responsibilities are great), they should preserve their lives. Because they want to preserve their lives, they have to move, and of course moving is not difficult for them.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army comes south, they move north (antiques, treasures, etc. go with them), when the Japanese army comes north, they move south, when the Japanese army comes east, they move west. Anyway, the Japanese army cannot come from the west, so they will not move to the East Sea, which is really a fortunate thing!</p>
<p>As for those with economic vision, of course, they spend ten million or five million in advance to set up private residences in foreign concessions, move their families there, which can save the trouble of moving back and forth, and can also avoid airplanes and all dangers, (preserve strength to prepare for resistance against Japan!) How wonderful! As for institutions and the like that are not convenient to set up in concessions, of course, it is a bit more troublesome to go back and forth, but in these days of convenient transportation, it doesn't matter much!</p>
<p>Apart from the unavoidable circumstances mentioned in the above small note, I still consistently maintain! Moving is very difficult, that's right! So we can only not move and really (resist Japan)!</p>
<h3 id="e301">A LETTER OF DIVORCE AND REMARRIAGE <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Nancun</p>
<p>Most people from the four districts of Guangdong venture far across the oceans to engage in commerce. Young men leave and return only when their hair is white. They prioritize profit over separation, often neglecting their wives. Occasionally, there are cases of wives secretly remarrying, which is truly lamentable. A certain Miss Mou from Tai County, born into a scholarly family, was quite literate. At the age of seventeen, she married the son of the Ouyang family in a neighboring village. Three days after their marriage, they separated for ten years. She was then seduced by a Mr. Ji and wrote a letter to her husband, divorcing him and remarrying. My friend, Mr. Ouyang, is a cousin of her former husband. He visited the family and sent me the original letter. I found the letter's wording and sentiments to be subtle and restrained, sad but not bitter, with the gentle and peaceful tone of a poet. I quickly transcribed it and submitted it to this column, hoping to warn those who prioritize profit over separation.</p>
<p>The letter says, "I have heard that Zhou Dynasty rituals have not changed, and a husband can remarry. Although the laws of the country are strict, they do not prohibit women from remarrying. Stay if you are compatible, leave if you are not. Marriage values freedom. Marrying again and again makes marriage seem like child's play. Therefore, though Huai Ying was of low status, she remarried Chong'er. Though Xia Shi was ill-fated, she remarried Wuchen. In ancient times, people valued etiquette and still could not remain married to one person until death. How much more so today, when people emphasize freedom. Why be surprised that people change their minds? Ask who in the world has ever kept a vow of chastity like the Cypress Boat? It is difficult for me to cherish youth like the willows by the roadside today. Moreover, you and I had only been married for three days before separating for ten years. My pillow is cold, my quilt is frigid, and I have long lived like a widow with a husband in name only. Time and things change, and I am left with a body waiting to die. Although there is the empty name of husband and wife, there is no joy of a family. If I wait twenty-five years to remarry, I will lament as I approach my coffin. I fear the decay of my beauty. The falling plums pass quickly, which is why I am so eager to leave and remarry. Fortunately, the old man under the moon is kind, and the red thread is tied again. A palace lady has intentions, and a red leaf is inscribed again. An old bride becomes a new bride. This is not my intention. A good couple turns into a resentful couple. How sad. However, Zhu Maichen was unable to support his wife and was forced to let her go. Shi Xiaoshu could not protect his wife and caused her to leave her husband. In the future, spilt water is difficult to recover, and I will part ways forever. After this, you will not see me in the palace. How can you feel anything for me? A parting gift. My thoughts carried on the wind. Please forgive me. I am endlessly agitated." I wonder if Mr. Ouyang felt anything when he read the letter.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Walking into a teahouse that also sold snacks, Wu Yi casually picked a seat, while Li Jinbiao first removed the stiff-brimmed police officer's hat from his head and straightened his clothes before sitting bolt upright on the square stool below Wu Yi.</p>
<p>(What exactly is going on)? After a round of tea, Wu Yi couldn't help but bring up the main topic.</p>
<p>(It's really a big joke)! Officer Li took a refined sip of black tea and said with a smile, (Principal Wu, I really don't understand why people's minds are always like this, why are they more clever than ghosts, and they can come up with all sorts of strange and cunning ideas! : : : )</p>
<p>(But, let's not: : :) Wu Yi heard him going on and on about empty theories, and hurriedly stopped him.</p>
<p>(Then let's talk about today's matter)! Li Jinbiao took another sip of tea. (Didn't the newspaper today publish a news item about a certain Xu Qiao? After our Director saw it, he became very suspicious: First, why didn't we hear about any kidnapping cases in the past few days; Second, Zhuangyuan Lane is a bustling area, and our Third District Fourth Precinct is located there. If something like that really happened, how would we save face? Third, no matter how fierce a certain foreigner is, he would never dare to make trouble in the capital; : : : He thought it didn't seem right, so he immediately summoned our Third District Chief Lin and told him to quickly send people to inquire in all directions, and be sure to find out the truth about this matter: : : :)</p>
<p>Wu Yi listened with fascination, holding an empty cup in his hand, not putting it down. Officer Li thought he wanted more tea, and hurriedly interrupted his words, picking up the teapot to pour for him.</p>
<p>(Don't bother! Don't bother! Tell me your story)! Wu Yi snatched the teapot and urged him to speak quickly.</p>
<p>(Our District Chief Lin didn't dare to neglect it, so he immediately went to the newspaper offices to inquire, asking them where the news came from. Everyone said it was sent by some correspondence. District Chief Lin hurried to the correspondence agency and saw that the correspondence agency was actually located together with the support association, and the president was that Xu Qiao. At that time, there was no one working inside, only two or three clerks left. District Chief Lin asked them where the Xu family's residence was. This question revealed the truth. Two or three people looked at each other, always hesitating and not speaking. District Chief Lin saw that the situation was not right, so he quickly called our Second District Sixth Precinct and told us to send a few brothers nearby. So I took three brothers to see him. He first told us to have one person guard the door and one person guard the telephone, not allowing them to communicate the news, and he himself tried his best to interrogate the three clerks, and after a while, one of them revealed the residence of Xu Qiao: : : .)</p>
<p>Li Jinbiao drank a cup of tea before continuing:</p>
<p>(District Chief Lin hired a car, took this clerk and the three of us, and rushed to Xu Qiao's house together; when we got there, it was lucky that Mr. Xu was just sitting in a bright and shiny car returning from outside: : : )</p>
<p>(Ah! Wasn't he injured)? Wu Yi thought this was too unreasonable, and hurriedly interrupted to ask.</p>
<p>(Don't interrupt me! Principal Wu! You'll understand when you hear the rest)! Li Jinbiao didn't answer Wu Yi's question first, but just told the facts. (Originally, neither District Chief Lin nor I knew him, but the clerk pointed him out. District Chief Lin saw that he was fat and big-eared, with red lips and white teeth, not to mention that he didn't look like he was covered in injuries or had walked forty or fifty miles, he was simply much stronger than us. He already understood half of it in his heart. When Mr. Xu saw that he had been led by his subordinates, he knew that he couldn't escape, so he put on a smiling face and hurriedly invited us in: : :</p>
<p>(After sitting down, he hurriedly offered tea and cigarettes, and was extremely polite. Then, he took out a large stack of banknotes from his pocket and smiled at District Chief Lin: (Old Brother), we are all people who make a living outside. Please keep this matter a secret for me: : : )</p>
