<p>中常委汪精衛關於開放政權之談話。在近日中央政聞中。不失爲一種足以刺激國人政治興味之消息。自本月初中常會改變召集臨時全國代表大會之成案。而决定於十一月間開五全大會。一時頗有人對於國民黨結束訓政。歸政國民之决心。表示懷疑。此觀於當時若干報紙之評論。可以知之。今汪氏之言。一則曰。五全大會將討論開放政權問題。渠與蔣意見相仿。再則曰。政府自動將政權奉還國民。並非欲藉此推卸國難責任。此種表示。已不啻以政權開放之遠期支票。付與國人矣。</p>
<p>某種政治學說。認政治運動。爲鬭爭之行爲。政權獲得。爲鬭爭勝利之結果。國民黨以北伐成功。實行黨治。就此種見地言。似無議論之餘地。昔時蒲徠斯一派。以參與政治。爲人民應有權利之一。今則世界黨治之國。數逾三五。在黨治下之各國國民。事實上已無法爭其參政之權利。此乃潮流所趨。未易抵拒者。中國自黨治以來。憲政派之論士。曾因要求參政權。要求製定憲法。作相當之活動。其結果所獲甚微。二十年九一八以後。國難當前國民黨以謀集思廣益。與全國人民共負責任之故。有國難會議之召集。在國難會議中。雖有召集國民代表會議之决議。而主席汪精衛對於一部分會員之要求立即取銷黨治。則以「只好去革命」五字答復之。今依前此中常會召集臨時全代會之用意與汪氏目前之談話。開放政權。還政國民。國民黨已準備自動行之。可無待於「去革命」矣。三年以來。國難日益深重。同時開放政權之事。亦隨之日有進展。使汪氏所出之遠期支票。及期而得照兌者。此種方式之移轉政權。安得不承認爲中國政治之特色乎。</p>
<p>開放政權之意義。據汪精衛孫科等以前所言。爲將由是進於民衆政治之途。冀得集中全國力量。以當國難。則政權開放以後。國民責任之加重。地位之困難。不言可知。行見今日之集中批評於黨治者。將轉移其詞鋒於我全國國民</p>
<p>之政治能力。亘三年之國難。倘使眞能代替他種嚴重方式。使國人由此獲得參與政治之權利。則國人今日。殊不可不準備解除國難之力量。以來國運之昌新也。</p>

<p>漢閩等通報效率增加</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨晨往訪交通部電報局業務主任華士鑑君、據談整理滬漢幹綫、重慶支綫、及對於大水聲中之預防幹綫損壞進行事宜等、均極詳盡、爰特分誌如下</p>
<h3 id="c101">整理路線 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>據稱、交通部近來整理路綫工作、極爲注意、現已整理完竣者、計有三線、㈠滬漢</p>
<p>幹線、滬漢通電、爲全國電務最發達之一線、每日收入當在二千元以上、是以該線地位亦極重、要該線爲雙宮式、每次一分鐘、可收發各百字、惟有時因中間發生走漏電流之弊、每每不能往來收發、僅能單程收發、致於時間上延遲不少、致交通部此次特派工務長趙侶生來滬、派員積極修理、至最近已完全修竣、此後電政業務上之發展可不致再發生阻碍矣、㈡重慶線支線、自巴東至巫山一段、長約百餘里、三年前、被川省神匪破壞以來、因匪患未淸、無法修理、及至本年一月、匪徒剿滅後、遂即派員前往修理、損失當在五萬左右、昨日接到報告、該線業已修畢、嗣後自漢至重慶一段、可以直接通達矣、㈢滬閩線、上海至福建一線、每年至入霉時、該電即受潮發生阻滯、現經交部派員修理後、本年入霉後、已不再發生同樣弊病矣、</p>
<h3 id="c102">預防水患 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>又謂滬漢幹線當、前年水患之時、各處電線之被其冲壞者、頗屬不少、本年自本月以來、大雨連綿、山洪暴發、雖尙未成巨患、其勢亦甚危殆、故交通部爲防患未然起見、飭令原有所設自上海至鎭江、自鎭江至蕪湖、自蕪湖至九江自九江至興國武穴以達終點漢口分置工務員四人、率領工作人員、每五日間、輪流派人前往沿線察勘、至本日止、尙無發生任何損壞、惟該項電線桿、大多植立於沿堤岸一帶、倘水勢繼續增漲、堤岸不固、被水冲潰、則植立堤上之電桿、亦難避免傾倒之虞云、</p>
<h3 id="c103">華北電報 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>華北電報、自停戰協定簽字以後、交通部早已準備於日軍出退後、設法恢復、惟日僞軍至今仍徘徊未退、致亦無從着手、故至今華北電報、僅祗能東至蘆台·西北至密雲·自開平胥各莊等沿海岸各線、仍始終無從恢復、是以此第當視日軍撤退情形、方能着手整頓云云、</p>

<p>派員赴甬吳淞輪慘案後援會得報後、當卽選派長興輪代表鄭予卿·曁吳淞輪難工高泳流、於下午三時搭寗紹輪船公司船赴甬、報告粤地交涉經過、並協助進行、</p>
<p>商援助該會又以太古工潮日趨嚴重、各輪工友罷工後之生計堪虞、特於昨午在該會會所開會籌商、到安慶呂雙禧·江裕·王建生·實和·吳聖卿·等七十餘人、由呂變禧主席、各輪代表表示、决定長期抵抗、各輪工友、自願作經濟之援助、如不達到圓滿結果、誓不罷休、</p>
<p>發生罷工自甬海員分會通電響應後、昨晚五時、甬班新北京班在甬行將開行時、實行罷工、船主急電公司請示、在輪搭客、實行退票、貨物擬由公司改托招商三北寗紹等輪裝運、該輪移泊外檔、形勢甚形吃緊、</p>

<p>丨江西吳城周寰忠君來信丨</p>
<p>我是一個年將及冠的靑年，但是年幼　少，並且還没有一點思想。我家住在江西舉新縣一個小鄉村襄面，我祖父與父親都是慈善的人，就是鄉襄一個農夫，又因手中拮据，無計謀生，只有窮扶苦奔，養大我叔父。但我叔有了十六歲之時，就令作絲線店的學徒於修水，出師以後，就在該地開了小絲線店，帶我在修水讀了幾年書。店中生意尙好，連年稍有徵利，漸漸積少成多。我叔父又是一個很儉約的人，最　信實，又開了一家布疋洋貨店生意，亦屬可觀。無奈近年該地市面，日見蕭條，又兼之地方不靜，頻年擾亂，屢被搶刦，竟有七八次之多，錢貨俱空了，我叔父視此情形，自知釜破舟沉，卽在目前。就因而憂心得疾，遂至不起。但是那個當兒我爲姪予的只是尋死求生，皆非善術，這個時間，又人學堂讀了幾年書。但當時的家庭一槪打破了，只是老老少少無事可爲，又無開心的親朋戚友。一家八口，衣食尙難維持，我又不能賺一文錢進去，後蒙親戚鄧君紹墩介紹在吳城匯大米號學徒，又遇着諸位師友敎者諄諄而語，無奈我聽者藐藐而忘。現在該店業務又告停止，我將來的生計危險萬分，處此環境毫無人生的樂趣了，家庭經濟亦有莫大的恐慌，請先生賜我一條最明白的方針。答：你處在鄉村普遍破壞的江西，生計問題，自難維持，我們在數千里外，如何可以憑空指給你「一條最明白的方針？這實在是一件不可能的事。承足下遠道來函，殷殷垂詢，無以報命，實在抱歉！本館在最近的將來，擬遴選專家親赴贛鄂各省調查農村，此行如獲得眞實材料將來或許對於貴省及湘皖各省改造問題，多少有點　獻·亦即所以報足下也。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>說也慚愧，蒙古是我們中華民國的一部分；至於「蒙古語大辭典」，　直在全國著作界中並不聽得有人去撰述這部破天荒的鉅著。</p>
<p>民國建立已經二十二年了；自已的地方，不想去設法調查和整理，當然一切都隔膜了！以大比小，　如一個家庭，握有了五分財産，最少限度，也該有五大本詳細精密的賬簿；你不立賬簿，人家便要代你立賬簿了。在九一八以前，滿州還是我們的領土，而關係滿洲一切風俗物産　域的圖籍，都是日本著作家替我們做「槍手，」替我們做捉刀人」，結果，我們把産權都奉送了，新名詞呌做「不抵抗」，舊名詞呌做「拱手　人」</p>
<p>滿洲如此，蒙古也是道設；外國人替我們立賬簿的已有好多人；有一八三九年的許密脫氏「蒙德俄辭典」，又有一八四六年的拉伐來夫斯基氏「蒙俄法辭典「，又有一八九五年的高爾斯丁斯基氏「滿蒙辭典」。在十九世紀中已有許多遠鄰在那記賬；現在呢，日本著作家費了十六年的調查和編輯的「蒙古語大辭典」，將在本年秋冬之間出版了間出版了！慣做「槍手」或「捉刀人」的矮疙𤺥，費心費心，偏勞偏勞。</p>
<p>據說：這部書非常豐富，語數計有數萬則，除與和文對譯外，並加入中國語，滿洲語，梵語做對照，定價約九十日金，價値雖貴，但出版以後，我國人要去　買的，一定不在少數；我們領土的「辭源」，不須自已去着手編輯，出了百十塊錢；便可以飽我們的眼福，再要老官也没有；中國人畢竟老官脾氣，中國人端的是寫意朋友。</p>

<p>這種「比本領」的方法，是很合「强者生存」的道理，呌做「自然淘汰」。猶如近代「洋學堂」裏的「未來中國主人翁」們的比賽足球，「三賽二勝」，才可捧了「大銀盾」回去，「放假一日，以誌慶祝」。雖然「打擂台」是「個人的」，「賽足球」是「團體的」，但「優勝劣敗」，「其揆一也」。</p>
<p>由「打擂臺」而「賽足球」，於是很合邏輯的，來一下子「畢業會考」。不錯，「秀才」，「舉人」，「進士」，「翰林」，以至於「狀元及第」，怎一個不是「比本領」比出來的。惟有這樣子比，才比得出「安邦治國」的人才來。您瞧，科舉一廢。國家便糟到如此地步，可知惟有「硬碰硬」的比一下，才有道理。</p>
<p>這一回子咱中國雷厲風行的舉行「畢業會考」了，這是多麽値得頌贊的事。聽說，這麽一來，可使在同一制度之下，所造就的人才，像無錫惠泉山所製的「大阿福」，一百個，一千個，都是一樣的嘴臉，缺了一個鼻子的「大阿福」，非重製過，不能應市。學生們也是如此，有一科不及格，最低限度，須再耐着性兒，屈爲「老童生」一年。</p>
<p>據說，這麽，非但可使不用功的學生們用功，而且還可一掃「要求範圍」，「派司」，「夾帶」等等積弊。參與「畢業會考」的學生們，便一個個像站在「梅花椿」上「比本領」，没本領的，莫想站得穏。這眞是「拔取眞才」之道，不知反對「畢業會考」者，是何居心。</p>

<h3 id="c220">關於藍采和 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>通常所說的八仙神話，不論什麽地方都同樣傳說是：「漢鍾離，張果老，韓湘子，鐵拐李，曹國舅，呂洞賓，藍采和與何仙姑」那八位。據我所知，各地方一律承認僅何仙姑是女仙，餘都男性。</p>
<p>因孫俍工先生編的文藝辭典，說藍采和亦係女性，便引起某先生的反辨，（見十五日本報自由談）他引了陸放翁南唐書中陳陶傳裏的一支歌，疑藍采和也許就是陳陶，而斷定藍采和是男仙。不過我知道在陸放翁以前；關於藍采和的記錄，有五代沈汾著的續仙傳，說「藍采和不知何許人也，常衣破藍衫，六銬黑木腰帶，闊三寸餘，一脚著靴，一脚跣行。夏則衫内加絮，冬則臥於雪中，氣出如蒸。每行歌於城市乞索，持大拍板，長三尺許，常醉踏歌，老少皆爭看之：：：。似狂非：：：」以時間論，當然續仙傳要早得多，這樣看，南唐書所謂「南昌有一老翁！成疑爲陳陶夫婦云，顯然是敷會，不足爲證了。</p>
<p>藍采和的歌，續仙傳作：</p>
<p>踏踏歌，藍采和！世界能幾何？紅顔一春樹，流年一擲梭，古人混混去　　，今人紛紛來更多。朝騎懋鳳列　　。暮見蒼田生白波。長景明暉在空　，　銀宫闕高嵯峨！」</p>
<p>所以和南唐書所載·也大有出入·手頭正有一本錢尙濠（振芝）緝的「買愁集，」也有這麽藍采和一條，歌詞和續仙傳没有多大異樣，所錯僅「到碧落」爲「看碧落」「蒼田」爲「桑田，」而最末兩句是没有的。</p>
<p>不過崑曲戲邯鄲夢的仙圓一齣裏，把八仙都一古腦兒配了進去，｜雖然與李泌枕中記馬致遠黄梁夢的情節不合｜那藍采和一角，則由老旦嗓子充任，這正像西洋歌劇配角以混合高中次音爲準一樣；俍工先生把藍采和認作女性，也許是上了崑曲書本的當也說不定。</p>
<p>如果去瞧仙圓的演出，便見那藍采和載着秀才巾，穿寳藍繡花襲子，飾成容雍的儒生態度。呂洞賓還唱着，「藍采和是個打猿本樂户官身！」那麽，對藍采和究竟「男耶女耶」的問題，不至像木蘭那麽「不辨是雄雌」了。</p>
<p>因爲補充某先生的反辨，才再寫此篇，並呈俍工先生。</p>

<p>聽歌現羨色報國身閑</p>
<p>桂枝明知道母親笑着是有原因的，這也就不去過問。可是有一層，由種種方面看起來，趙家的婚事，竟是越說越眞了。若照着現在這個態度，這件事當然是成功。不過趙連長這個人雖是不錯，然而自已心目中，向來不打算有一個軍人丈夫若是嫁一個軍人，却並非夙願。想到這種地方，又不免發起愁來。記得街西頭劉家媽，他的丈夫，也是當軍人的，何不順便去請敎請敎他，軍人的生活，究竟是怎麽樣？當時擱在心裏，也没有什麽表示。因向江氏道：媽，您準是中寒了，躺着就多躺一會子吧？劉家媽家裏，不是有丸藥嗎？我去討兩顆來，給你發發汗罷。江氏道：用不着，我多躺一會兒，倒是可以。說着就躺下了。桂枝心虚，怕勉强要去的話，會引起母親的疑心，當日也就不說了。到了次日，江氏還是精神疲倦。桂枝說，非得吃點丸藥不可。作過午飯吃了以後，自已就向劉家媽走來。他們這兒，也是前後院，前院是個私塾，有個牛先生，在那裏敎書。後院就是劉家媽帶了兒子過活。桂枝走到後院，劉家媽正在屋子裏洗白菜帮子，看見桂枝，在瓦盆裏，拖出兩隻濕淋淋的手，向他笑道：希客，老姑娘有功夫來坐坐。桂枝笑道：無事不登三寳殿，有點小事求求您來了。劉家媽笑道：你說罷。挑我能帮忙的。桂枝道：我媽昨日中了寒。劉家媽道：你要丸藥，有有有。來了，就坐一會子走，别忙，裏面屋了裏暖和暖和。說着，他掀起圍襟，一面擦手，一面引桂枝走進屋去。桂枝道：劉家媽，您眞省，吃不了的老白菜帮子，您還留着呢。劉家媽答道：丢了怪可惜了兒的，抓把鹽醃起來，就小米粥喝，倒是一碗好菜，不信，你試試。說着話，讓桂枝暖坑上坐着，在坑眼裏掏出一把瓦茶壼來，倒了一杯茶給他喝。笑道：窮家烟捲也找不出來一枝給你抽。（一一三）</p>

<p>— 逸騶</p>
<p>一天晚蜷伏在鳥　式的寫字間裏，埋着頭幹筆墨工作，天天如此，自已覺得頗有些橡一架寫字的機器。</p>
<p>上海最繁盛的區域，簡直可說和自然界隔絶，春天到了，看不到什麽桃花楊柳，聽不到什麽燕子黄鶑；秋天到了，也看不到什麽黄葉丹楓，聽不到什麽寒螿哀雁：只是隨着空氣溫度的升降，換換衣服罷了。</p>
<p>「紅了櫻桃，綠了芭蕉，」的初夏，已在不知不覺中怱怱地過去了，「浮瓜沉李」的炎夏，又將到來，但住在上海繁盛區域的我，對於這些，都很隔膜，只看到幾家小食店在賣冰淇淋，汽水，洋貨店在賣草帽，扇子，　知道夏」已過去了一半。</p>
<p>三月裏預備到龍華去看桃花，終於没有去，前幾天馮君等發起的閔行夏游會，也爲了被事情纏住，跑不脫身，昨天事情略爲閒一點，天氣又好，便到辣斐德路顧家宅花園去換換空氣，順道到天一公司去參觀拍影片。</p>
<p>天一公司在法租界甘世東路的盡頭，公司附近，頗有些鄉村風味，公司南面，有很大的嚝地，上面種着菜蔬之類，更有竹籬瓦屋，裏面的主人翁，都是些短衣跣足的農工階級，身臨其境，彷彿到了鄉間。</p>
<p>前年夏天，該公司初次開欇有聲片的時候，我曾隨友人徐君來參觀過一次，不過那時因有别的事情，只怱怱的打了個圈子就走了。這次由邵醉翁君親自招待，陪着我到攝影塲去看拍戲，並告訴我公司中的現狀。</p>
<p>攝影塲的外而，本是一片廣塲，現在大加改造，亭池花木，頗　園林之勝。廣場的東北面開掘了一個L字形的小池池旁圍着綠色的鐵闌干，沿池邊碧草紛披，夾着一叢叢橙黄色的小花，異常好看，幾棵比人高一點的小樹，滿綴着綠油油的葉子，池的南面，有個六角式的亭了，柱子闌干，都髹以朱漆，和綠色的草樹相映，格外美麗，亭外一方小畦，種着玉蜀黍和黄瓜，演員魏鵬飛，正在替玉蜀黍加肥，魏君在銀幕上，常飾一種誠樸的老農，現在他眞的幹農人工作，確是很有意味。</p>
<p>走進攝影場，見場中搭着兩個佈景，都是簡樸無華的鄉村屋子邵君告訴我：南面是「飛絮」的佈景，北面是「掙扎」的佈景，這時還没有開拍，場中都是些着短衣穿草鞋的人物，如果面部不化妝，幾乎當他們是攝影場打雜的小工。袁美雲着了一件千瘡百孔的破衣服，聽說她在「飛絮」中飾一個可憐的女孩子，一生在灰色的命運裏打轉。劉炳華和鮑志超，都剃了光頭，劉君是「掙扎」的男主角，鮑君是「飛絮」的男主角，都是天一新識拔的小生人材。</p>
<p>「掙扎」女主角陳玉梅，因爲没有戲，坐在旁邊閒看，她穿着白色的運動衣，頭上戴着一頂打　式的帽子，原來她剛在打完籃球。</p>
<p>（噹噹噹」一陣鐘聲，這是開拍的記號於是全場的人立時忙亂起來有的配置燈光，有的陳設器具，導演裘芭香，脇下挾着一本劇本，右手拿着一支鉛筆，一會兒告訴演員怎樣怎樣表演，一會兒跑到攝影機旁去看鏡頭的地位，指揮攝影師把攝影機移動。每拍一個鏡頭，正式拍攝的時間，不過二三分鐘，而配光，對鏡頭，佈置器具，以及演員的試演，却要費去二三十分鐘，我只看他們拍了三個鏡頭，已經過了一個多鐘頭，看看時候不早，便向邵君告辭而回。</p>

<h3 id="c223">說駡 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 陶裴</p>
<p>駡，無可異議地是一種藝術。</p>
<p>要是「言爲心聲」那句話是對的，那末駡可說是靈塊的影子：駡在那里，靈塊也在那里。</p>
<p>正如言有正反反面一樣，駡有意在内的與意在外的的分别。</p>
<p>要是你駡「天氣壞極了，又下雨｜」這是意在内的駡，因爲你的確討厭下雨，在駡以外並不含有「哦，多美麗呀，女人的淚似的晰瀝地滴着的雨！」的贊歎的意思。</p>
<p>可是意在内的駡並不是藝術，是藝術的是意在外的駡。</p>
<p>要是你喜歡睡，非到十二點或者一點不起身，同時又怕被人家發覺而遭物議的話，那末你可以駡「那天九點鐘我去看某人，竟還没有起身，眞腐化！」由此可證明，因爲你九點鐘已去到你一個朋友的家裏，你是一個不腐化的早起者。這樣駡了，就是有人在你未起身以前來看你，他會以爲你的遲起是或者爲了頭痛，或者爲了寫文章寫到天明；要是你自已樣說一說，那就更妥貼了，你是一個貪眠者的觀念决不會再進入他的腦中去。要是你是一個想那麽睡而在事實是不可能的人，你也可以這樣駡，反正只有你自已知道，那駡的意思並不眞要表示你　起的淸高，而同時，這樣表示着也並不是一椿要不得的事情，只是證明那遲起的可羨慕。</p>
<p>以自已的弱點，移在别人的，或者說與你有同樣的弱點的人的身上，而把它用做被你駡的對象，這樣你的弱點可一件一件地從你的身上卸下，而成爲一個輕輕鬆的人物。</p>
<p>駡，無可異議地是一種藝術。</p>

<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>凡稍懂一點歷史故實的人，都知道淸談始於魏，盛於晋，衰於陳隋。以横槊賦詩的魏武帝，居然會殺孔文舉，害　正平；以述典談文的魏文帝，竟也會煑荳燃箕，同根相逼；文士的不得不被迫入於淸談，在這裏也可以想見他們的心事了。降而至晋，懿昭父子的兇狠殘酷，當然要比曹魏更勝一籌。揮塵談玄，旣能免禍，又可圖名，讀書種子，焉得不竸尙此風，而來兼收名實呢？到了陳隋傷亂，天下紛紜，文皺皺的讀書人已經是無塵可揮，無玄足述了，淸談的消滅，也是自然之理，然而文人苦矣。近世的淸談，似乎變了一箇樣子。大報小誌上，連篇累牘地載在那裏的，大抵（一）是天災，（二）是性罪，（三）是要人的行踪與傳聞軼事，（四）是關於同時代的文人的連嘲帶駡，疑假若眞的消息與批評。「今朝天氣哈哈哈」，果然是淸談的極品，「名敎中自有樂地，何爲乃爾也」，更是談言微中，情文並至的文章。究竟還是淸談誤國呢，還是國誤淸談？這倒眞有點兒難說。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>早幾天自由談發表的一篇二丑藝術，給胡適之先生送行，實在是再恰當没有的文章。</p>
<p>胡適之行後，國内二丑一類的角色，正患其多，不患其少，不過經豐先生這麽一嘲笑，又不知有多少人疑心在掻他的瘡疤。</p>
<p>昨天，翻看老殘遊記，不覺拍掌呌奇；在文人中乃有設想造成一個典型的二丑，如老殘其人者！</p>
<p>老殘是怎樣一個人呢？他會做詩，他懂醫學，他能治河，他善預言，他還兼福爾摩斯的差使，能偵探疑案，救治｜三條性命。他不曾做一官半職，但他的一封信，可以直達宮保，平復一塲已成定案的大寃獄，連剛弼那麽剛愎的人都不能不退避三舍。他自來不名一文，只有一串鈴搖來搖去，但誰都願意把成千成萬的大洋錢送給他。他「身在江湖，心存魏闕」山林的名士，而無時無刻不在政治旋渦中打圈子。說他閑，他眞忙得可以；說他忙，他又十二分的空閑。劉鐵云筆下的理想人物，也正是一應「二丑」所景慕的典型。</p>
<p>胡適之先生，民國十六年間在東亞同文書院講演中國近三百年的四個思想家，顧炎武，顔元，戴震以外舉到某先生，我百思不得其解。現在我是明白了，胡適心目中的理想人物，也就是劉鐵雲心目中的理想人物，旣得其人，云胡不喜；而且胡先生自已也已經仿傚得很像，不必打扮，可以上塲了！</p>
<p>這樣，我們也可以了解胡適之先生在五四運動時代，爲什麽把老殘遊記特别捧得高的緣由了。</p>
<h3 id="c226">夏之夜 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>入晚，日間的餘　尙未退盡，風也凝滯着不動，坐在室内儘是淌汗，　身的血管襄像有千百隻熱辣辣的蟲在爬，我兩手交換地狂揮着芭蕉扇，豆大的汗珠仍是在我的週身直淌。這時候，我又想到了冬天的可愛，雖說在冬天我也曾咒詛過那使人笨滯使人畏縮使人頽廢的酷寒。</p>
<p>記起了小時父親告訴我的「心靜自然凉」的話，於是我把電燈開燃，把椅子移到靠近窗户的寫字檯前，隨手在書架上取了一本最近出版的丁玲女士的「母親」，打算用强注式的閱讀把我紛亂的心思平靜下去。這法子果然有效，不到一刻鐘，週身的汗珠即被從窓外透進的習習微風吹乾，芭蕉扇已從手中自然地丢落足旁，我親切地感到了　熱過後的舒適。</p>
<p>然而另一種煩擾接着又來了，那便是一種細小而具有尖喙的靑蟲。</p>
<p>大槪是追逐光明之故，電燈一開亮，這討厭的小蟲優紛紛從窓外飛來，起初是一隻兩隻，：：：撲到燈罩上，書案上，撲到我手裏的書葉上，撲到我的面上，手上，牠没有聲息，只是遍處爬，或是用牠那尖銳的喙在我的面上和手上死力地喙，使人感到分外不舒服的微癢與遭受敵人意外　　似的一驚。</p>
<p>這時候，對於這　爾小醜，我並没有絲毫介意。當牠撲到書葉上時，我只是　手一拂；當牠在我的面上或是手上爬走使我感到不快時，我便隨手一掌，立即，一個細微的尸體便滾落到我的足旁，我只輕蔑地看牠一　，仍舊漠然無動於中地看書。</p>
<p>然而靑蟲是愈來愈多了，這時候已經不是一隻兩隻，而而是一大學　　一大學高中在　　　盤旋飛舞，使你服花撩亂；牠撲到書　上，使　　變爲和麻子一股的　看；牠撲到　上和手上，這裏啄一下，那裏啄一下，使你手足無措；有時牠　會撲進衣内，和偷見一般的輕輕地爬行，使你週身感到　穌穌地，旣抓不着，又看不見，不得不放下　剶閱衣服來搜索，而且這一大羣小醜盤旋飛舞，也居然發出很大的音響，吱吱　　，　　吃桑　發出來的聲音一樣，聽來便人心　　溜地難過。</p>
<p>這　擾亂使我非常憤怒，我扔下書，霍然地立起，用忿怒而冷酷的　光掃射這盤旋飛舞着的一羣，樣亂者，懷着報復與減滅此　後快的心情，疾步地取得蠅拍，疯狂似的拍：：：拍：：：拍，一下，兩下，三下，：：：於是　細小的屍體便是一堆兩堆三堆。我　然立這屍堆之前，有如一個凱奏歸來的英雄，又如一個殘忍狠毒的暴君。</p>
<p>似乎這蠅拍的屠戮　不足以消滅我心頋的怒火，還不足以表示我對那一羣小醜的憎惡，於是我又想出更殘忍的酷弄，我用筆尖作刑具，一　一　說着　那　　的　　　　　着　　　的生命宛　掙扎，我又劃燃自來火挨次地　，直至那魚貫着的屍體發出難聞的　臭。轉之這時，我是以着最大的决心來對付着這擾亂者之羣，我想，像這樣約疯狂的屠　和可怖的酷刑總可以使這一羣擾亂者消滅　盡，使我回復到那靜心　書的舒這。</p>
<p>然而我的打算終於失敗了，那可憎恨的靑蟲似乎根本不知道屠戮之可怖，只要有燈光，牠還是成羣結隊的飛來，還是那樣地盤旋飛舞還是那樣他遍處爬行，還是那樣地在我的面上手上亂啄，我疯狂地舞弄着蠅拍，小小屍體便一層加上一層，然而死的儘管死，來的仍儘管來，到最後，我已經用盡了我的氣力了，汗珠直倘，氣咻咻，望着這憨不畏死的擾亂者，只能咬牙切齒，只能僨怒，我没有抵　的能力了，我便高聲呌妻，「到馬路上散步去」。老實說我是逃了，我是已經失敗在這擾亂者之羣的手裏了。</p>
<p>第一次，我了解了羣字的意義，我了解了羣衆力量之　大。</p>

<p>末了的話續）</p>
<p>雷辟克｜什麽手藝？你難道要我把你送到一個鞋匠家裏去做學徒嗎，打個　如的話？紅蘿蔔鬚｜鞋匠家裏或者别的地方都虸。我可以自已賺到飯吃，我可以得着自由。</p>
<p>雷辟克｜可惜太遲了，我可憐的紅蘿蔔鬚。我花了那樣多的錢給你受敎育，難道是爲着要你去釘鞋底的嗎？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚｜但如果我告訴你，爸爸，我曾經想要自殺，你便怎樣呢？</p>
<p>雷辟克｜你說得像煞有介事啦，紅蘿蔔鬚。</p>
<p>紅蘿克｜我向你發誓，就在昨天我還想要吊頸呢。</p>
<p>雷辟克｜而你現在還活着。可見你並不想死。可是一想到你那失敗了的自殺，你便驕傲地把頭抬起來。你以爲死祇誘惑過你一人呢。紅蘿蔔鬚，利已心會使得你尖　的。你祇顧到你自已一個人。你以爲你是孤零零地生活在世界上。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚｜爸爸，我的哥哥是幸福的，我的姐姐是幸福的，如果媽媽不存心和我搗亂，像你所說的一樣，我可以把我的舌子割下去　貓。末了，至於你，你是一家之主，人家都怕你，連母親也怕你。她絶不能妨害你的幸福。這可證明人類裏面有些人是幸福的。</p>
<p>雷辟克｜你這執拗的小東西，信口亂談。你能看淸各人心裏的秘密嗎？你已經懂得一切事情嗎？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚｜關於我自已的事情，我懂得的，爸爸；至少我在努力使我自已懂得。</p>
<p>雷辟克｜那麽，紅蘿蔔鬚，你莫想得到幸福了。我可以預言，你以後决不會比現在幸福的，决不會，决不會。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚｜這是可能的。</p>
<p>雷辟克｜我勸你忍耐着罷，自已防護自已罷，等到你成年能絇自主的時候，你便可以自由了，你可以不承認我們，改換一個家庭，不然便得改換你的性情和脾氣。在這以前，你可想法子使自已占着優勢，壓住你的感受性，觀察别人，甚至那些和你在一塊兒生活着的人們；這樣你便會覺得狠有趣的；我可以担保你會得着許多意外的安慰。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚｜無疑的，别的人也有他們的苦痛。可是我要明天才會去憐惜他們。今天呢，我却要替我自已要求正義。那個命運不比我的好呢？我有一個母親。這個母親旣不喜歡我，我也不喜歡她。</p>
<p>「而我呢，你以爲我喜歡她嗎？」雷辟克狠焦燥似的突然說。</p>
<p>聽　這幾句話後，紅蔔鬚舉起腿晴向他的父親。他狠久狠久地瞧着他那冷靜的面孔，他那濃密的鬍鬚，｜那裏而躱着一張像是話說着太多害羞了的口，他那有着折紋的額角，他每只眼角上的三條縐痕和那使他走路時都現得在睡覺似的低垂的眼臉。</p>
<p>暫時紅蘿蔔鬚話都說不出來了。他恐怕他那藏在心裏的快樂，和這被他捉到且差不多以武力保有着的手，一切都會飛掉。</p>
<p>隨後他握着拳頭，威嚇着假寐在那邊，在那黑暗裏面的莊，誇張地呌道：「惡劣的女人啊！你竟是十全的了。我憎惡你。」</p>
<p>「快不要　，」電辟克說，「無論如何，她總是你的母親呀。」</p>
<p>一啊！」紅蘿蔔鬚回答，他又現着坦率和謹愼的樣子。「我並不是因爲她是我的母親才說出這樣的話來呢。」</p>

<p>— 小之</p>
<p>前星期本埠上海電力公司發覺有用户串同機匠營私舞弊作駭人聽聞之大規模竊電情事，經捕房嚴密偵查，旋捕獲要犯多人。據稱：有未獲之剩犯周某（曾在日本留學成工程師）能照樣倣刻維妙維肖裝置電表外壳螺絲上之鉛印（按：該鈴印爲該電力公司特爲防止竊電情事而置者，）并能以高妙手術將電表拆卸，撥動　碼，使所費電力之字減少，然後裝以僞造之鉛印。：：：乃聨絡在電力公司專任此項職務之職員某某等代各廠家作弊，事後由各廠家給以少許酬勞。：：：作弊廠家，實不可計數，證據充予以起訴者有二十餘家（按：其中十九都是絲廠與絲織廠）</p>
<p>在現社會組織下，當然的有好些所謂「紳士」「高等華人」之類的正人君子們都要擺出假理智的臉孔，說：「不要臉，不守法的下流東西｜盜竊行爲也是本份，也是法律允許的嗎？：：：堂堂一個留學生，甚麽事不能做，而偏去做這丢醜的勾當！眞眞可嘆！：：：」</p>
<p>誠然，誠然！「要臉」而又「安份」「守分」的「高等東西」紳士之流的金石之言是最漂亮悅耳不過的。然而在另一方面，我們應得眞的把這腦袋兒冷靜一下，用點眞理智的功夫，至少，也得注意以下的事實。</p>
<p>㈠每年出國留學與學成歸國的留學生的人數該是有多少！姑無論他們究竟實在的學識如何，以已經客滿了的現有分賦式的用人制度而又裙帶化了的國内不論那一界，是否還有空餘的地位來安挿他們｜當然是說留學生中窮而没要人關係的一羣？然而他們同樣是人，同樣具備了人的生活需要的條件｜他們需要吃飯，他們需要居住和穿衣：：：但他們一樣也得不到，他們當然也不能眼睜睜地等候着餓死凍殭，自然的，比較觀點錯誤或不澈底而對現社會及其制度没有所認識和主義的弱者們唯一的求生方法就是利用他的小聰明而幹偷竊等等不齒於所謂「高等華人」的所謂「犯法」的勾當了！我們明乎此，該是嚴厲責誰呢？：：　　㈡據報載，此次作弊的各廠家，大半都是絲廠與絲織廠。這便可見我國絲産業的不景氣了。我國的絲産在世界上原是首屈一指，近年來竟一落千丈！一方面這固然是天災人禍與絲織從業者不用科學方法去改進出産所致，另一方面實在是受不平等條約的束縛以致外國人造絲霸佔了我們整個的絲的市場！（我國生絲産額每年約二五二○○○擔，而外國人造絲進口數量亦有一三○八九一擔！）爲了這些，資本小，規模陋的我國絲廠，當然日近於崩潰與没落，而商人的簡單的算盤裏『「竊電，」是不無小補的，』至於「手脚　噹被牽入法律的公堂」他們又何嘗没有知道？</p>
<p>總之：偷竊是實，犯法是實，不齒於高等華人亦是實，但其觀點錯誤和没主張更是實而無可再實！除了這些「實」以外，我們還得承認：社會問題已經趨於極端的尖銳化了，當然　是實！</p>

<p>— 賢</p>
<p>這一天，阿順爹早上起來。他的多紋的面上永遠是那樣的陰沉，自從去年欠了三十多塊錢　以來，　溪村的　民，從不見阿順爹有過一回笑臉，除了「唔唔，」的微微牽動他的嘴角。這一天，意外的，他起後，搯冷水洗臉的時候，兩聲「咕，咕」從屋檐上送進阿順爹的耳朶。他不自信地丢了面布，踏出門檻，走到打麥塲上，抬頭兩隻鵓鴣撲翅「咕，咕」的向後飛去。這時候阿順爹笑了，可惜他兒子媳婦没有瞧見，他又」唔，唔，總有一天要下雨」的自語起來。</p>
<p>他像什麽得意似的，跑進廚房吞了兩碗冷飯，抹抹嘴，從牆角提起他的永遠没有離身過的旱烟袋，雖然好久没有上鎭去買十二枚銅元的一莊旱烟，含在嘴裏空抽抽却也有同樣的效力。他像一個悠閑的莊家似的再走到打麥塲上，趕鴨招姐的歌聲無邪的從小河邊送來，今天阿順爹對於這歌聲並不討厭，他覺得招姐這孩子很引人喜歡的。遠處的山，這時候還不見被陽光照着，天空是陰沉沉地，「咕，咕」，這可愛的幸福鳥又在阿順爹頭頂上掠過，「唔，唔，總有一天要下雨的｜」阿順爹笑了，像小孩子見了賣糖的一樣的笑。</p>
<p>一陣風吹來，阿順爹面上似乎着了幾點雨點，他還不信，張起他的粗黑的手掌雨却是一陣緊一陣的大了。一時「下雨了」的聲浪在這村上歡呼起來，他的兒子媳婦已從車棚那邊趕來。他們是跑的那樣快，趕鴨的招姐　緊緊跟在後面，一羣鴨子「呷，呷」的在田岸上賽跑。</p>
<p>「爺，下雨了！」兒子氣喘喘的喊。　　雨在每個人的頭頂上打，誰都知道下了雨，但是他兒子的報告，阿順爹好像還是新發見似的抬起頭來望了望天空。他忘形的想抽旱烟，呼了幾口，舉起旱烟袋在被雨打濕了的麥塲上輕輕地打幾下，像打去烟似的。阿順望着他爺的忘形，心中正在盤算天下雨了，今年的收穫不會比去年壞，只要上塲時米價漲，三十多塊錢債還了之後，還可多幾十白洋細。明天冒雨上鎭去替爺買莊旱烟吧｜其實祇要下了雨，阿順爹對於旱烟早已不放在心上，他仰首天空，轉的念頭｜也是三十多塊錢的債。</p>
<p>他微微的笑着，「總有一天要下雨的，」忽然頓悟三個人像永　一般淋在大雨中。「阿順爺，還不進去換衣服」說後三個人都笑了起來。</p>
<p>這一天晚上，老頭子也没有說起三十多塊錢債的話，兒子也不覺得脚掌的水泡發痛。笑意充塞這小小的三間茅舍阿順也早已乖乖地爬上床去睡覺。</p>
<p>「原說哩，我們鄉下人從不做壞事，罪惡｜天罰我們餓死嗎？」今天阿順爹患了笑病，他又不自知的笑了起來。</p>
<h3 id="c251">秘密 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>「姐姐怎麽這樣漂亮起來了？」這是十歲的小弟弟的一個大大的疑問。</p>
<p>「姐姐怎麽不像從前那樣｜｜跳跳笑笑，整日浸浴在天眞的快樂裏了。而且母親也有了異樣，當衆是一幅苦笑的臉，背了人就只見她抽咽　氣，尤其是深夜，成者破曉的淸晨。」這些全都是年輕的弟弟所理解不透的，他只是暗地默想。</p>
<p>因爲姐姐漂亮起來了惹得弟弟也起了幸運的憧憬，這誠苦惱了頭髪花白了的龍鍾母親。弟弟時常扔起破舊的衣襟，撲倒母親懷裏，撓着小嘴吧說：　　一媽媽。姐姐穿起漂亮的衣裳來了，我也要穿！」這好像利刀似的刺割着母親的心，但她只有壓住騰昇在喉管裏了的哀情，不自然的用着慈詳的口吻說：</p>
<p>「乖孩子，你不要糾纏，大了有姐姐那樣大了，也給你做兩套，現在可不興｜而且，乖孩子，你要諳事，就是現在給你做，你穿去翻垃圾·不是寃枉糟塌了麽？」</p>
<p>「唔，唔，我要：：：去翻垃圾的時候，我曉得換下來留在家裏！」</p>
<p>「乖孩子，别再糾纏了，快些肩了竹簍去尋生活，早些去，早些回，别在外邊厮混。來，你來，我還藏下有碗冷麵給你吃，唉！」</p>
<p>弟弟聽了母親的一聲唉，」立即反個眼望了一下她的臉，這時母親的臉，眞使他奇駭，蒼白的雲　，泛滿了皺紋的面幕，他自動的離開了她的懷抱，有冷麵吃，當然也是他不再糾纏了的一個原因。</p>
<p>兩年前，家鄉遭了汎濫的水災，在雷雨交加的深夜裏，父親披　戴笠去堵塞堤壩，不幸一去不復還，明天早晨，全家浮在澤國裏。幸虧遠村的避難的舟子划過，哀求了許久，得搭救了母親姐姐同弟弟，一路路的漂浮，竟漂到了這天堂似的城裏。</p>
<p>到了城裏，母子三人，經歷過一度沿門的乞食。</p>
<p>後來姐姐找了一個絲廠裏的工做，弟弟便肩了竹簍沿街去翻垃圾桶，母親呢，頭髮花白了，就登在家裏吃點現成飲食。人家看了他們是很苦，但在一間黑暗潮濕的灶披間裏，一家三口，倒也團聚得十分快樂。</p>
<p>可是不幸得很，不到三個月，絲廠停了工，於是姐姐也成日登在家裏，母女相互瞪視着，生活的困厄是不在話下了。因此弟弟的工作特别加緊了，深夜裏還得肩了竹簍到街頭巷尾去尋找生活。</p>
<p>有一夜，時候已不早了，他正蹲在一隻街旁的垃圾桶旁，忽的一個小年挽着一個女人飛也似的從他的身邊掠過，走向前頭一家　數的旅館裏去了，</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>得分明，那女人確是他的姐姐，他想追上去，一息便連影子都不見了，於是他晦氣的肩了竹簍回去，這一氣，就沿路眼見有香烟頭，爛布，紙屑一類的生活物，他也懶得拾了。</p>
<p>到了家，脫口便向母親這樣問：　　「媽媽，我剛剛看見姐姐挽着一個陌生的男人到一家大旅館裏去了，那是誰？做什麽事？怎麽不要我們也一同去？｜｜媽媽，我也要做兩套新衣裳！」</p>
<p>「呸，你發暈不成，姐姐分明復工去了｜｜｜又來糾纏我，做什麽新衣裳，老早說過了，大了，有姐姐那樣大了，定規給你做｜：：：今天尋了多少生活？」</p>
<p>「唔，唔，唔，只有二百文，還吃了六個子的冷麵。」</p>
<p>在鷄啼的破曉裏，滿肚子疑問的弟弟，從迷糊的睡眠中，隠約地聽見姐姐的喊聲，母親的開門聲，隨着是「瞌睡死了｜」「我等候你半夜了！」「兩元！」唉！」悽切的兩三聲。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一事，廔欲請敎于先生，終以學識虚無，恐有詞不達意之處，致躊躇不敢實行；現在事實上是無可再耐了，特將詳細經過，敬述於後：</p>
<p>我的業師｜｜在鄉鎭開設商店的｜｜三年前兼任徵收田賦之責｜即該地之地保｜｜當時由該地各業主｜｜即田主｜｜向縣政府負責担保。奈年來鄉村經濟，突呈破産，所有各鄉户，正在謀充饑之不及，何來繳納此項年年增高的荒墳頽宅之糧稅：致地保所負之欠數亦漸大。迨至去年五月，將地保拘留押繳，但是他被拘押後，無人籌措，亦無從籌措，照該縣老例，若地保無力了理時，當由原保之業主，負理處之責。但是，雖由縣府出票傳提，該負責之業主，經向縣府中人一度運動之後，縣府亦置諸不提了。及今一年有餘，敝業師本人感到牢獄生活難忍，家屬備受苦痛已極，故自願破産以了之。但他本人在獄，妻爲鄉婦，子女年幼，不知怎樣辦是好？現在其本人及家屬委托無能無力的我代辦，爲特謹問於高明的先生，仰一一指示，實深盼感！㈠用何手續，能使縣府執行破産？㈠破産時所欠私人之債，是否可列入？㈢自願破産後，再吃官司嗎？㈣所有産額雖或不滿債額，有否再提出若干作家屬生活費的理由？㈤若請律師代辦，訴訟及公費，可否在該産内支用敬祝</p>
<p>撰安！小店員張華謹上</p>
<p>編者按：這件一斷不是破産可以了事的。要是貴業師實有侵佔稅欵的事情，那末除查封家産外，尙須押追；追全之後，還要處刑。國家命脈所系的稅源，豈容催征史任意乾没。萬一貴業師並無侵佔行爲，短收賦稅，確係民欠，那末貴業師根本無責任可言。縣政府濫用權威，拘押無辜，經年累月，這種不當處分，可依行政訴願法向省政府及財政廳控告。一經申請破産賠償，侵佔罪反會坐實的。</p>
<p>查各縣征收田賦，事前必造具印收　　　　　　　第一　爲通知　　單，第二聨爲收條，成稱執照，第三聨爲　　。論理　開　之前，應將尙重交於像征吏散發。業主憑了由單上的數目，自封投　完納，取得執照爲憑。凡是没有完過的業户，那麽執照應與存根相聨。　限之後，應由征收處開刻淸單，交催征吏督催。所以「自封投櫃」與「串（執照）不離根」實在是征稅制中的天經地　。不過實際調查的結果，能照此辦理的縣份，實在很少；大多數的縣份名爲變通，實即預留作弊的餘地，現在且將各縣最普通的所謂變通辦法，寫兩種在下面：㈠有的縣份，印收造得很遲；　如今年民國二十二年了，還竟可以連二十年的印串，没有造竣，他們所憑以收稅的，是一種小票。印串是每田一坵，都有一張，編有號碼，印有應完銀數，非如數完足，不能自存根裁下的：小票則不然不過是一種臨時收據，他並不限於每坵一張，而且數目也隨時塡入的。所以在這種縣份，　如我今年應完稅銀千元，可以商由徵收處，先完半數，要是面子大的話，或者還可以低些。因此往往有許多没勢力的人，他的賦稅，是由大鄉紳出面完的。小户納七八折的稅於大户，大户納五六折的稅於縣府，縣府祗報解四五折於省政府。層層中飽，上下交相利，官紳明比爲奸。㈡有許多縣份，印串造好之後，即將第一聨由單及第二聨執照，同時裁下，交由催征吏催收。這種辦法，弊病也非常多，打一句官話，串旣離根，就可作爲完全收到，講一句情面，也就可以作爲完全未收。在這種縣份裏的催征吏，據編者的調查，差不多没有一個不作弊的，不過胆子有大小罷了。我們並不十分責備他們，因爲這種制度，實在有誘感的作用在裏面呀。張君的師，大槪就是碰到這種縣份，所以編者不敢十分深信他全無弊端（或許是不對嗎？）；現在縣政府打了官話，所以有口難分了。爲今之計，我們以爲應自已將挪用之欵，設法交出；其眞正没有收到的，那末可以聨絡全體催征吏，向縣政府據實稟明。他們兎死狐悲，一定可以帮忙的。而且爲一勞永逸計，應當要求實行「自封投櫃，串不離根」的辦法，以求後不再吃這「打官話」的虧。</p>
<p>編者是離上海不遠的嘉定縣人，在我們那裏，當然也有許多看不上眼的政治，伹是征收制度，確辦得差强人意。自封投櫃，串不離根，是實行了許久，我們納稅的手續，很像到火車站賣車票一樣，即使缺少一兩個銅子，執照是不能裁的，寗可將錢退回。催征吏的責任，不過催而已矣；大不了撤職罷了。省政府財政廳，祗能向别縣催解；向我們嘉定就不行了，因爲弄到後來，縣政府可以呈請查串，作爲有欵無欵的鐵據呀。但是這種辦法，於稅收也很有利：在平常年份，在十二個月内，徵起之數，總在九成至九五之數，别的縣份，恐怕反没這樣起色。可見變通辦法，完全是作弊辦法也。</p>

<p>「今晚老爺又不會來，要這麽多菜幹嗎。」</p>
<p>「還有李先生｜」長發的說話總是簡短而有握的。</p>
<p>「李先生？」阿珍這年靑娘姨經過姨太太的訓練變得已很機警，連忙裝着自已說錯了似的道：「哦，不錯！」</p>
<p>恰巧李先生下來找洋火抽香烟，阿珍故意討好地道：</p>
<p>「李先生，快要吃晚飯了，不要出啊？」臉上泛出一朶神會的笑，眼珠子卦到眶子上邊看着石喬的臉·眞的，阿珍的笑容，單純而又天眞，有時候會比三姨太更迷人些。石喬没有回答她，抽燃了烟自上樓去了。</p>
<p>三姨太是不會讓時間空過去了，她隠了地聽到皮鞋槖槖的上樓聲，頭便在門邊探望了出來。</p>
<p>「李，李，：：：」她第一次感覺稱呼的困難了。如果喊李先生，怎像是稱自家的堂兄，人家豈不懷疑？單喊名字，也不像是稱呼兄長輩！喊哥哥嗎？一時又不順口｜而且，隨便你是怎樣大胆的婦人，也有點難爲情吧！好在她那善於表情的眼睛早使石喬朝向她身邊走來。</p>
<p>「你剛回來麽？來，快來坐在這裏｜」她把石喬拉到一條長沙發上并肩坐下。石喬心不在焉地看着她一條腿｜她故意</p>
<p>「不准，不准，你壞東西｜」</p>
<p>石喬微笑了，把叢亂的頭髪往後一甩，注視那張滿意地斜看着他的臉。三姨太太這種斜看的角度認爲最能看出石喬的美點：頭髮仍然是篷亂亂的，鼻子很高，唇皮却薄，下頣有力地畫出一個長面孔輪廓·往下看，洗了多次的衣服，縮得把全身的肌肉緊襯出來，手臂向前灣屈着顯出一種男性的蠻勁：：：：：三姨太的幻想會比男性看見女性的肉感來得更快呢，她在社交界中看慣了一般修飾得光光的男子，那都是些淸淡的蘋果呢啊啊，看呀這是一隻何等有刺激性的椰子，熱帶的椰子呀，</p>
<p>那椰子却仍在想着自已的一些心事｜璧如張洪烈周紹平今天怎樣了，學生義勇軍到底組織好了没有，以及他籌畫着編一個宣傳抗日的雜誌的事，這些事當然是三姨太所不了解，也不願了解的事。不過石喬又何曾澈底地了解得啊！而且這些事都正在不順利的情形中，他心裏正悶着在老不高興。</p>
<p>一會兒，酒，酒來解他悶了，滿桌的菜堆着，他毫不厚顔的選着吃。</p>

<p>— 星</p>
<p>＝中央電檢會大開方便之門神怪肉感武俠片的被釋放從一九三一年，中央電影檢查會採取嚴格主義之後，中國國産片，被禁的不知凡幾。這麽一來電影界的空氣　爲之一淸，電影界的精神，雖爲之一振但公映影片的量數銳减了，而因此倒閉的公司也就不在少數。兩年功夫小公司淘汰到現在，已不滿三十之數了。</p>
<p>粗製濫造的影片，現在是不多見了。不過一年以來，小公司出品被中央不與通過的影片，已達一百部之多。於是在一九三三春天，十八家小公司聨合向中央涕泣陳情，居然在不久以前，得到了相當効果。</p>
<p>據說中央爲了體恤商艱，和維持國産片前途起見，擬了一種特殊辦法，發行了一種「未通過國産片臨時准許公映執照」。限期六個月，凡一切國産片不論已映未映，凡被禁者，都可以受這優越的待遇。於是被禁的影片居然有了重見天日的好運了，</p>
<p>雖然期限祇有六個月（本年六月十五日到十二月十五日），但是每一張影片，都能在六個月之中，在全國横行無阻的放映，即使不能賺錢，至少亦可收回攝片時的工夫資本一部份的代價。小公司們得了這一筆意外的收入，亦可多維持幾年營業。或者在這兩三年裏，還能再攝幾張優良的片子，國産片前途亦大有裨益，這不能不說是中央電檢會諸公的德政了。但是：：</p>
<p>此學不但使小公司佔了便宜，即内地各小影院也因此得了實惠。内地影院爲了當地居民的嗜好，多一半專映國片，近兩年只有幾家大公司出品。量旣少，租價又高。求過於供，遂時有片荒之感。近半年來，受了經濟凋敝的影響，更有破産的局勢。這一次小公司出品，源源而來，無異於大旱之得雲霓，間接也就受了中央的惠賜。一舉數得（還有内地一部份的居民，又能大飽眼福，償滿了他們的低級興趣）。當然亦是善著咯。</p>
<p>據我所知的，小公司近十日來運往内地的影片，已有四十部之多。在上海公映的，七月份預定，至少當在十張左右。内中三分之二，都由聨華公司或中央公司代理。當然肉感武俠的味兒，佔了不少的地位，神怪片爲數亦可驚人。或者明星公司「火燒紅蓮寺」友聨公司「荒江女俠」等等，又將風行一時，重新出現於滬上了。</p>
<p>當然一件事，有利必有弊。此風一開，在全國各地尤其内地文化閉塞，迷信深固的地方，於道德人民上有什麽影響？中央電檢會從前加以禁映的最初的原則，是否已經放棄，我們還不暇深論。但我們可以看得出中央電檢會的表面目的，是維持國産製片的小公司而已。當此國庫空虚，社會蕭條的今日，或者這也是一種無辦法中的「治標辦法」。（摘中央委員某君言）不過我希望不久的將來再有治本的辦法出現，</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c255">觀「健美之路」後 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 徐海容</p>
<p>這張片子，所取的題材，實在是很新頴的。牠是以流浪江湖的賣藝者的生活來做背景，而寫出舊社會的殘酷。我們從銀幕上隠約可以瞧見舊社會的一副猙獰的面目。</p>
<p>把整個的劇本來說，我們承認牠的意識是良好的，不過其中不免有些疵點、例如。富家子韻聲，也在自已的學業没有成就，不能獨立生存的時候，就急急的講戀愛，並且爲欲達到他的最後目的起見，竟和他原有的未婚妻解約，和他的戀人｜賣藝女｜結婚。後來還加入到賣藝團去表演，雖然他這種不分階級的戀愛是純潔的，然而我們從客觀的事實上來批評他，這種急於談婚姻，而置自已的學業於不顧的行爲，究竟不是一條靑年應走的正當的途徑。</p>
<p>導演的手腕很好，他把一個很複雜很曲折的故事，排演得有條不紊，使觀衆自始至終不感到一些厭倦，這是他成功的地方。不過我以爲他對於葉飛飛的外祖母及母親等死的一叚穿挿，未免寫得太長了些，以致劇本不能十分緊凑，這是很可惜的。</p>

<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>這是艾霞自已編，自已主演的作品，雖不能說是身歷其境的經騐談，但至少總比閉門造車的人好些吧？但表情雖然是這樣的逼眞，而意識仍有不少矛盾之處。</p>
<p>這裏所呐喊的不是有一句「戀愛澈底」的口號嗎？但蔣萄萄與余冷的戀愛程式與動機，可以說是「澈底」的嗎？萄萄是一個浪漫的女子，她不知道什麽呌貞操，祇知求性慾的滿足；余冷是一個拘謹的男子，他不知什麽戀愛，祇需要金錢與生命。他們倆的所謂「澈底戀愛，」就是建基在性慾與金錢上面的，所以即使萄萄不犯罪，余冷不撤手，他們的結果也是不會好的，因爲戀愛根本不是這樣的一回事。</p>
<h3 id="c257">談「現代一女性」 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>現社會裏的摩登女性，她們戀愛觀念的對象，大多不外是金錢和美男子，有的只要有金錢，能享受物質上的舒適就夠了。有的却要找尋財貎雙全，而年齡相當的男人，其中有任何一件不滿意時，便會大胆的不顧法律，道德，名譽等，而搆成種種罪惡和黑幕。</p>
<p>「現代一女性」裏的主人翁蔣萄萄，就是屬於後者一類的，這樣背景很好的題材，原可把黑幕儘量的演映出來，如果劇本的本身不拘泥於任何人的以往的事實的話。但是社會裏五花八門的繁榮狀態所産生的種種悲喜劇，在「現代一女性」裏終于不能描摹得入木三分。</p>
<p>那位記者不是和萄萄有舊誼嗎？三年不見了，久别重逢之下，定有一番更親暱的情感，然而在相會之後的幾天，萄萄問他說「你愛我嗎？」記者竟會呆若木鷄，又不像所謂躊躇，眞是尶　相。死了孩子，停了職，愛妻離婚·姘頭入獄，以致頽廢沉淪，該是余冷最悲痛悽惻的時候，但幕上給予觀衆並無怎樣的深刻和緊張。萄萄入獄後遇到了她的朋友安琳，應當互相驚異，也没有交代出來·這些豈不是微疵嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c258">觀「春水情波」後 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 鶴山</p>
<p>每天翻開報紙，觸目的就是略誘，，和姦，騙婚，遺棄等等新聞；畸形社會裏殘酷的開展，不知蘊育了幾許幽暗的罪惡｜「食色」本是天性，何况「飽暖」的有錢階級·拿女人當絶好的消閑品呢？同時·女人們虚榮的企慕，和意志的薄弱，也成了現社會普遍的現象；尤其在禮敎束縛半掙脫之後，婦女解放没有眞正實現的今日，更給予男性們容易進攻的機會。</p>
<p>春水情波，就是一部暴露這種罪惡的影片，牠大聲疾呼地喚醒被玩弄的女性們的迷夢，尤其給蹂躏女性者一個有力的警戒；意識可說很健全。至少比不着邊際的空洞問題切合於需要。</p>
<p>本片最不可埋没的，是導演的功績。他用輕靈的手腕，巧妙的銜接，把個極平凡的故事，舗叙得這般緊凑而深刻。畫面毫不浪費，描寫也很着力。對於阿毛遭遇的悲哀，尤其抓得住每個人的同情。劇中每個轉變的演進，和苦樂的對照，都顯得自然而合理。演出方面，也找不出重大的缺點。</p>

<p>— 時春</p>
<p>好萊塢的不景氣現在是一件一件的在製造著。演員們固然已經感覺到環境的恐慌導演先生們或者還不至於受到這患　潮流的影響而發生不景氣的現象罷，但是滿目瘡痍的好萊塢終究不能保全導演先生們的尊嚴了。</p>
<p>現在有四位導演先生在好萊塢因爲得不到工作賦閒了好久而恐慌起來，他們没有方法能夠維持生活於是連合了想出了一個妙法，他們放棄了導演工作而做演員，這是何等悽凉的一件事情呀！這四位導演先生中有一位是赫赫有名的在好萊塢已經担任了十幾年導演的卡爾佛氏，在十五年之前他導演的一部ＢｒｏｎｃｈｏＢｉｌｌｙ曾受到不可一世的聲譽，但現在連生活都不能維持，這是何等可憐的事，還有一位曾在環球公司享受第一流導演威名的斐雷潑史馬萊，現在亦在好萊塢賦閑着，得不到一些足以解决麫包問題的工作，還有一個是獸片導演家弗蘭克皮，一個最窘迫的呌做沙麥斯李蓋氏，債台高築，負數千元美金，這四位導演先生因爲導演生活養不活自已一個身軀，所以自降地位，演一部影片，自任演員，片名呌做「權勢與光榮」，當然是一部充滿騷描苦楚的作品了。</p>

<p>又名『贛南剿共記』</p>
<p>盤　贛，粤，閩，湘，鄂，的共匪，確是我們民族的「心腹之患」。去年秋，他們受着中央軍的壓迫，於是傾巢南犯，冀圖佔領廣東作根據地，幸虧南路剿匪總司令陳濟棠早有準備，率領所部，協力勦擊，把共匪趕回老巢，其中戰事之烈，犧牲之大，是在勦共史中最値得紀錄的一回事。</p>
<p>「心腹之患」就是當時的隨軍記者冒萬死在戰塲上實地拍攝得來的一張戰事片。内容由共匪南犯起，直至克服匪區止，都有很詳細的紀錄。此片光線的明朗，實爲各戰事片之冠，現已運滬，定廿八日在南京首都大戲院公映；至於上海方面，則决定北京大戲院開映云。</p>

<p>Deng Zhexi, carrying a letter from Feng Yuxiang, arrived in Beiping. On the evening of the 27th, Song Zheyuan hosted a meeting at his private residence, inviting Deng, Qin Dechun, Zhang Jiyong, and others to discuss the Chahar affair. Song decided to report the meeting's progress to He Yaozu on the 28th, who would then cable the Central Government. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>The National Government in Nanjing issued an order on the 27th, specially appointing Sun Dianying as the Reclamation Commissioner of the Western District of Qinghai. This order... (Central News Agency Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Ma Boyuan, representative of Huang Fu in Beiping, visited Song Zheyuan this morning to discuss ways to resolve the Chahar situation in detail. Song invited Pang Bingxun, Qin Dechun, and others for lengthy talks in the afternoon. Deng Zhexi, Feng Yuxiang's representative, arrived in Beiping at six o'clock this evening. After getting off the train, he immediately visited Song to exchange views with Kong Xiangxi, who will be responsible for matters with the central government, and Zhang Jiyong, Song's representative. After a resolution is decided, Zhang Jiyong, Deng Zhexi, and others will take it to Zhangjiakou to confer with Feng. Deng said that he meets with Feng daily in Zhangjiakou. Feng has always held the principle of "dealing with external enemies, not internal ones" regarding the Chahar situation. Feng highly praised peace and had no personal concerns about advancement or retreat. Feng hoped that Song would return to his original post in Chahar as soon as possible and instructed him to convey this message. He is currently in Zhangjiakou, working hard to recover the lost territory in eastern Chahar in order to realize his goals. Zhangjiakou is peaceful. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Since the troops of Ji Hongchang, Li Zongyi, Deng Wen, and others from the Chahar Province army moved north from Zhangjiakou, and the brigade of Bao Gang under Fang Zhenwu moved with Bao towards Datong, only the teaching regiment and guards of Feng's troops (3,000 men) and the brigade of Zhang Renjie under Fang's command (3,000 men) remained stationed in Zhangjiakou. At 7 a.m. on the 27th, Feng gathered all the stationed troops in Xincun for a lecture, still encouraging the soldiers to resist Japan with force. Because Liu Guitang recently sent another telegram to the Beiping Military Council expressing his willingness to surrender and has not actively advanced between Tingkang, Baobao, and Changchang, Feng suspects his sincerity. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Zhangjiakou, Beiping, Feng's troops have concentrated in Zhangbei. On the morning of the 27th, Wei Ziyu and Chen Fengtong were dispatched to Zhangbei to inspect the troops of Yu Yanong. Fang Zhenwu has recovered from his illness and resumed office as usual on the 27th. Zhangjiakou is full of soldiers, half of whom are from Anhui, and the transportation and hotels resemble an Anhui guild hall. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Liu Guitang sent a telegram from Guyuan, stating that he is reorganizing his troops and vowing to resist Japan to the death. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>All parties are continuing to mediate the Chahar affair, which may enter a peaceful path. The precarious situation may soon be resolved. Feng sent a telegram to Song yesterday, saying, "If you can return to Chahar, I will leave everything to you to handle in order to seek peace." Feng's representative, Deng Zhexi, may come to Beiping from Zhangjiakou in the next few days to exchange views with the authorities. In the future, he may go to Zhangjiakou with Kong Xiangxi for further discussions with Feng. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Fang Zhenwu's troops in Beiping are actively replenishing their forces in Zhangjiakou. Recently, troops stationed near Zhangjiakou were ordered by Feng to move to Zhangbei.

<p>Yongjin Has Been Transferred and Replaced by Chayama</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Lutai, Beiping, the Japanese and puppet troops in the area have not withdrawn and continue to occupy the railway line, harassing our troops from time to time. Around 10 p.m. last night, they fired several shots at our troops in the Yanzhuang area. Our troops were on high alert but did not retaliate, and the situation returned to calm. There are more than 200 puppet troops stationed in Ninghe city, and more than 200 Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai town, northeast of Ninghe. Yesterday afternoon, more than 20 Japanese soldiers entered Ninghe city and stayed in the Chamber of Commerce for several hours before leaving. Li Jichun, commander of the puppet troops, has dispatched many of his followers to various counties to recruit soldiers on a large scale, causing bandits to gather in various counties and the people to suffer greatly. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the disposal of puppet troops in Beiping, Yongjin has not yet sent a reply telegram to Beiping. The Japanese General Staff has sent Yongjin abroad for inspection for a period of two years. Yongjin has already gone to Harbin from Changchun. The position of military attache at the Japanese embassy has been taken over by Chayama, who has arrived in Shanghai and will come to Beiping within a few days. It is said that he will liaise with Chayama on the affairs of the puppet troops. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Lutai, Beiping, the puppet troops in the Lutai area have not moved. The puppet troops in Ninghe are still stationed in the city. Today's newspaper reported that the puppet troops in western Luan were moving, withdrawing from the Xugezhuang and Tianzhuang areas to Tangshan and concentrating in Luanzhou. Only more than 200 puppet troops remain in Tianzhuang, and they are scheduled to withdraw completely today or tomorrow. This is not accurate. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>The day before Shen Honglie's incident in Qingdao, the Zhenhai warship arrived from Tanggu. Now many suspect that the navy's conspiracy was agreed upon in Tanggu, because the Haiqi and Haicheng warships arrived one day before the Zhenhai warship. The murderer, Feng, was tried and executed by the military court on Sunday. Although the officers and soldiers of these three warships and the Zhahe and other two warships declared that if Feng was executed, they would not obey Shen, it was still ineffective. After Feng's death, the five warships sailed away without authorization that night and passed Shidao at noon on Monday. Only three small warships remain docked in Qingdao. The situation is extremely chaotic. According to several sources, this incident was caused by several naval officers who wanted to obtain lucrative positions on land, which Shen refused. Currently, everything in Qingdao is peaceful, and American and Japanese warships are docked in the port. The mayor is still working as usual. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e22">American Cotton and Wheat Shipments to China Still Pending <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The National Government Cables the US Yesterday to Consult on Detailed Measures</p>
<p>Nanjing: An American diplomat stated that the reports in the Chinese newspapers in recent days that the first batch of American cotton and wheat would be shipped and that the distribution methods had been finalized were premature. It is said that Minister Song Ziwen only signed a framework contract with the American Finance Construction Company for a total of US$50 million, with an interest rate of 5% and a term of five years, secured by the national unified tax revenue. After this matter was approved by the Chinese government, a cable was sent to the United States on the 27th (because Mr. Song still has two staff members in the US handling the matter) to consult on detailed measures and establish a detailed contract, such as the standard for cotton prices, the statistics for wheat prices, the conversion of freight, the number of shipments to China in installments, and the confirmation of shipping merchants. Therefore, it will be difficult for the first batch to arrive in the near future, and the exact total amount is still unknown to the Beijing government. The so-called proper distribution does not seem to be the right time. In addition, a certain person in Guangzhou telegraphed the United States to obstruct the loan, but it is unlikely to have any impact because Song represents the government and is the current Minister of Finance, so his signature should be more legitimate, and the Guangzhou protesters are mostly opposition parties. American businessmen value facts and do not focus on theory, so the cotton and wheat loan will definitely not be halted by a single telegram from Guangzhou. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>The Control Yuan in Nanjing continued to discuss the issue of the reorganization of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics today and decided not to take over the institution and advocated for its merger in order to save funds. The proposed measures are as follows: (1) The Budget Bureau, which is in charge of the national budget, shall remain under the jurisdiction of the Financial Committee. The Statistics Bureau, with regard to administrative matters, should be transferred to the Executive Yuan, which will establish a bureau or office to manage it. (2) The Accounting Bureau should be completely abolished, and the chief accountants of all agencies should still be selected and appointed by the respective heads of the agencies. The above resolutions will be submitted to the Central Political Committee and the Ministry of Finance for revision tomorrow. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Wang Luyi Presides Over the Oath and Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Nine members of the preparatory committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, including Yang Hu and Lin Yinsheng, were ordered by the Central People's Movement Committee to come to Nanjing to be sworn in. Except for Yang Hu, who was responsible for public security in Shanghai and could not spare the time, and Lin Yinsheng, who did not arrive, the other seven, including Liu Jincao, held a swearing-in ceremony at the Central Auditorium on the morning of the 27th. Wang Luyi, the deputy director of the Central People's Movement, presided over the oath and delivered a speech, stating that the Chinese Seamen's Union has a long and glorious history of contributing to the Party's revolution. He hoped that the preparatory committee members would work hard and expressed three hopes: (1) The preparatory committee members should establish close relationships with seamen across the country, eliminate past disputes, and build a sound trade union. (2) All seamen, under the leadership of the Party, should establish firm and accurate credibility. (3) The preparatory committee is the basic work of the Seamen's Union. Each preparatory committee member must keep the welfare of the workers in mind, find ways to improve their knowledge and work efficiency, so that they can become a sound and pure trade union in the future. The speech was followed by a reply from Zhang Zhao, a member of the preparatory committee, before the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Nanjing: Soviet Russia's reply to the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway is very weak. It does not cite the Sino-Russian General Principles Agreement, but the Fengtian-Russian Agreement signed during the Zhang Zuolin era, which states that Manchuria can recover the railway by paying the price. In fact, according to the spirit of the Fengtian-Russian Agreement, the Chinese Eastern Railway should not be sold to Japan without China's consent. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: According to news from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the second protest letter against the Russian sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway was delivered to the Soviet authorities by Wu Nanru, the counselor of our embassy in Russia, on the 25th. It is reported that the Russian and puppet representatives have gathered in Beijing to begin negotiations on the sale of the railway. However, both sides lack sincerity, and there are still many problems with the future of the meeting. (Central News Agency Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The negotiations for the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway will not hold a formal meeting today, but Gezinievsky, the Russian representative, and Vice Minister Ohashi of "Manchukuo" will hold informal talks. The Manchu side hopes to hold a formal meeting at 3:30 p.m. on the 28th to present a proposal to the Russian side. However, the Russian side is cautious and has not responded. The Russian delegation, based on the first meeting yesterday, wants to accurately understand the views of the Manchu side and is now working to collect information from all parties. Before this work is completed, the Russian side does not seem to be expressing specific matters such as the terms of sale. (Japan Allied Press Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: As a result of the consultation between Chinese Eastern Railway sale meeting member Gezirovsky, Vice Minister Ohashi, and Russian Consul General Long Lushuierkov at 3 p.m. on the 27th, it was decided that the second formal meeting between the Russian and Manchu representatives would be held at 3 p.m. on the 28th at the residence of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs to discuss substantive issues. (Japan Allied Press Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Chinese Eastern Railway transfer conference is scheduled to begin substantive discussions on the 28th. The topics of discussion are the transfer of the right to jointly manage the Chinese Eastern Railway and related businesses, and the payment of compensation by the Manchurian government. Because the economic prices of related businesses are very low today, their valuation cannot be estimated separately, and many must be transferred according to the Japanese Civil Law on the transfer of objects, which is equivalent to the relationship of accessories. Once this negotiation is completed, it will become an agreement on the transfer of all rights and interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway belonging to the Soviet Russian Constitution to "Manchukuo." The official document will be signed by the Russian and Manchu representatives. (Dentsu Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: In order to facilitate the smooth progress of the Chinese Eastern Railway purchase meeting, which held its first meeting on the 26th, a committee was formed by Soviet Russian Far East Minister Gezirovsky, "Manchukuo" Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ohashi, Head of the First Section of the European and American Bureau of Japan, Nishiharuhiko, and Lieutenant Colonel Suzuki Sadakazu of the Army.

<p>Tokyo: The appearance of the first day of the Chinese Eastern Railway sale negotiation was announced last night in a statement. Foreign Minister Uchida gave a speech as follows: The Soviet Russian government has proposed to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan or "Manchukuo." After considering the matter, the Japanese government believes that it is most appropriate for "Manchukuo," which has the closest relationship, to handle the issue. After consultation with "Manchurian government," the "Manchurian government" expressed that if appropriate conditions are met, it can also accept it. Regardless of the original purpose of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it has been a crucial hub for Eurasian links for more than 30 years. Since the establishment of "Manchukuo," the economic significance of the Russian and Manchu relations has changed, and it has had a negative impact on the relations between the two countries. The Soviet Russian government's proposal this time is to examine the new situation in the Far East and to increase peaceful relations with Japan and Manchu by selling the railway. "Manchukuo" also accepted the proposal from a broad perspective, which is gratifying. Now that the negotiations have begun, the first step of our mediation has been completed, and we will continue to do our best to mediate as necessary for the progress of the negotiations. This is specially attached.</p>

<p>The Soviet Ambassador, in a speech, stated that the Soviet government considers its friendly relations with Japan as a major factor for peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, it will increasingly emphasize this point and strive to enhance friendship. Based on this policy, the Soviet Union has maintained a strictly neutral and absolutely non-interfering policy since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident. On one hand, it considers Japan's interests, and on the other hand, it strictly adheres to treaty obligations, expressing its attitude of maintaining good neighborly relations with neighboring countries. Recently, concerned that the Chinese Eastern Railway could be a source of conflict between Japan, Russia, and Manchuria, and that various forces opposing peace could use this route to worsen relations between Russia and Japan, as well as Russia and Manchuria, the Soviet government immediately informed Japan that it intended to fundamentally resolve the issue by selling the Chinese Eastern Railway and was prepared for negotiations. The ambassador stated that although the railway, as mentioned in Foreign Minister Uchida's speech, was built by the Tsarist Russian government in other countries' territories to achieve imperialistic purposes of conquest, the Soviet government has no such purpose, nor can it have such a purpose. The October Revolution completely eliminated the railway's significance as a tool of imperialistic aggression. However, the Soviet government considers it an obligation to protect the material interests of the railway, as it was built with the hard-earned funds of the Soviet people. The ambassador expressed hope that these negotiations would achieve satisfactory results with the active assistance of the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ding Shiyuan, the pseudo-envoy, stated that the Chinese Eastern Railway is a relic of the old Tsarist Russian era's Eastern policy. The existence of this railway in our country easily provokes disputes between Russia and Manchuria. The "Government of Manchuria," in view of this, is willing to accept the transfer if the conditions are appropriate. (27th Transmitting Telegram)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the French Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Martell, visited Vice Minister Shigemitsu at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about Japan's policy regarding the transfer negotiations of the Chinese Eastern Railway. He stated that French capitalists, during the construction of the railway, not only invested six million rubles through the Russian Bank but also subscribed to a large amount of corporate bonds afterward. Upon hearing that purchase negotiations were about to begin, they organized a bondholders' group in Paris. Therefore, the ambassador formally proposed to the Japanese government to reserve the interests of the bondholders, drawing Japan's attention. Vice Minister Shigemitsu replied that the old debts related to the Chinese Eastern Railway had been assumed by the Soviet government under the 1924 Russo-Manchurian Agreement. Moreover, Japan is not a party to these negotiations, so it cannot fulfill the obligation of preserving rights.</p>

<p>An editorial in the New York Tribune stated that the Soviet Union's plan to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to "Manchuria" is of great significance because this negotiation clearly recognizes "Manchuria" and indicates that the Soviet Union will no longer care about Manchuria in the future. If this negotiation succeeds, the Soviet Union will no longer be able to call itself the protector of the victims of Asian imperialism. This fact is a disgrace to the Soviet Union and will inevitably cause deep resentment among the Soviet people towards Japan, which the Soviet government will never be able to explain satisfactorily. The newspaper concluded that if the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway succeeds, Japan will become even more complacent and believe that its military policy towards Asia is a success.

<h3 id="e30">Opening up Political Power and Relieving National Crisis <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>WANG Jingwei, a member of the Central Executive Committee, recently spoke about the opening of political power, which is a piece of news sufficient to stimulate the political interest of the Chinese people. Earlier this month, the Central Standing Committee changed its previous decision to convene a temporary national representative conference and decided to hold the Fifth National Congress in November. For a time, some people expressed doubts about the Kuomintang's determination to end political tutelage and return power to the people. This can be seen in the comments of some newspapers at the time. Now, Wang said that the Fifth National Congress will discuss the issue of opening up political power and that his views are similar to JIANG’s. He also stated that the government voluntarily returns power to the people and does not want to take the opportunity to shirk responsibility for national difficulties. This kind of statement is equivalent to giving the people a long-term check for the opening of political power.</p>
<p>Some political theories regard political movements as acts of struggle. The acquisition of political power is the result of a victory in the struggle. The Kuomintang's implementation of party rule after the success of the Northern Expedition seems to leave no room for discussion from this perspective. In the past, the Bryce school regarded participation in politics as one of the rights that people should have. Today, there are more than three or five countries in the world under party rule. In fact, the people of all countries under party rule have no way to fight for their right to participate in politics. This is an irresistible trend. Since the implementation of party rule in China, scholars of the constitutional faction have made considerable efforts to demand the right to participate in politics and to demand the formulation of a constitution. However, the results were minimal. After the September 18th Incident in 1931, the Kuomintang convened a National Crisis Conference in order to seek collective wisdom and share responsibility with the people of the country. At the National Crisis Conference, although there was a resolution to convene a national representative conference, Chairman Wang Jingwei responded to the request of some members to immediately abolish party rule with the words "we have to go to revolution." Now, according to the original intention of the Central Standing Committee to convene a temporary national congress and Wang's current remarks, the Kuomintang is prepared to open up political power and return power to the people automatically, without having to "go to revolution." For three years, the national crisis has become increasingly severe. At the same time, the matter of opening up political power has also made progress day by day. To allow the long-term check issued by Wang to be cashed on time, how can this method of transferring political power not be recognized as a characteristic of Chinese politics?</p>
<p>According to what Wang Jingwei, SUN Ke and others have said in the past, the significance of opening up political power is to advance to the path of people's politics and hope to concentrate the power of the whole country to cope with the national crisis. Then, after the opening of political power, the increased responsibility and difficult position of the people are self-evident. It is foreseeable that today's concentrated criticism of party rule will shift its rhetoric to the political abilities of our entire people.</p>
<p>If the three-year national crisis can truly replace other serious methods and allow the people to gain the right to participate in politics, then the people of today must be prepared to relieve the national crisis with strength in order to bring about a new era in the country's destiny.</p>

SONG will probably visit Berlin and Rome, and then board a ship at Venice to return to China. SONG has stayed in London for a long time, longer than he expected. SONG did not intend to stay in London for a long time to wait for the Economic Conference to close, so his return to China now is not a change of plan.

<p>The Netherlands and Switzerland May be Forced to Abandon the Gold Standard</p>
<p>British Pound Policy Controls European Financial Situation</p>
<p>London Today, the Dutch and Swiss currencies plummeted, causing fears that the Netherlands and Switzerland would be forced to abandon the gold standard, and the International Economic Conference focused on this crisis. The European gold standard countries are worried about being forced to abandon the gold standard. This afternoon, they urgently requested British Prime Minister MacDonald to clearly inform them of Britain's future gold pound policy. The key members of the central banks of France, Belgium, Switzerland, Netherlands and Germany held a secret meeting this morning and are deeply worried that Britain will also imitate the US President's inflation policy, devaluing the pound, which would increase the tension of gold in Europe and make it impossible to maintain the gold standard. Therefore, they asked Britain to explain its attitude. In addition, it was decided to take steps to maintain the gold standard and discuss self-defense plans. This afternoon, it was also heard that British Prime Minister MacDonald, in view of the Netherlands and Switzerland being forced to abandon the gold standard, will use his qualifications as the chairman of the Economic Conference to ask them to maintain the gold standard. According to the opening prices this morning, the Dutch currency was 8.565 and the Swiss franc was 17.66. The closing prices yesterday were 8.58 and 17.665. The opening prices at 2 pm today fell again to 8.52 and 17.64 (National Telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>Amsterdam The decision of the Dutch bank to only exchange cash in the morning has caused fears of inflation among the people here. This afternoon, the public did not know the implementation of the new chapter and was worried that the Netherlands would stop paying cash, but the bank has now stated that it will exchange cash as usual tomorrow. After the bank stopped exchanging cash in the afternoon, the prices of British, American, and French currencies have all risen (Reuters, 26th).</p>
<p>London This morning, the economic conference was very concerned about the threat of US inflation and the recent currency changes. The fall of the Dutch currency yesterday was quite pessimistic in some respects. The situation of the economic conference depends heavily on the attitude of the UK. If the UK can guarantee to maintain the price of gold pounds, the general worries can be immediately eliminated. Unfortunately, the UK does not seem to be willing to abandon its traditional policy of observing the situation. In addition, the general public hopes that the arrival of US representative Morrison in the UK can bring some comfort regarding the US monetary policy, but public opinion is very skeptical about this (Havas, 27th).</p>

<p>Washington Today, official news, although the US President is unwilling to continue inflating the currency to maintain prices, if the progress of commercial recovery encounters obstacles, he will use his power to inflate the currency to eliminate the obstacles. However, since the US government implemented the first step of the inflation program, the price increase and increased employment achieved have been stimulated by other aspects and have been able to remain strong so far. After this national heatwave, grain prices have risen accordingly, and the implementation of the federal unemployment relief program has caused the need for machinery, clothing, and raw materials. Private inventories have been sold out. According to the Ministry of Commerce, there has been real progress in the domestic economic situation. Therefore, the President now believes that the inflation program has started the wheels of industrial and commercial recovery. If it encounters unexpected obstacles, it will have to inflate the currency again to maintain it. However, officials believe that there should be no need to inflate the currency again. Because the Midwest has experienced a heatwave and drought not seen in 30 years, livestock and wheat harvests have been greatly affected. It is expected that grain prices will be high in the future. If the southern cotton fields are destroyed by a quarter as planned by the President, the prices of ordinary goods that are transferred by the prices of wheat and cotton will be able to remain firm (National Telegram, 26th).</p>

<p>London The various subcommittees of the World Economic Conference continued to reconcile differing opinions on important issues today. The Trade Committee discussed bilateral and multilateral commercial agreements. Representatives mostly favored bilateral agreements. The German representative stated that Germany advocated multilateral commercial agreements because it needed to balance its import and export trade and because of its agricultural needs. Representatives from Hungary, Poland, and other agricultural countries had the same proposal. The Monetary Committee discussed the minimum limit for issuing banknotes and gold reserves and decided that the law regulating this ratio should be flexible. The Silver Committee also exchanged the draft principles developed last week regarding regulating the balance between supply and demand in the silver market. The committee decided to send the report back to the drafting committee (National Telegram, 26th).</p>

<h3 id="e37">British and American Opinions Differ on the Issue of International Commercial Debt <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Chamberlain Explains that the Position of Creditor Countries Should Restore Credit The US Representative Proposes Raising Prices and Reorganizing Debt Together</p>
<p>London When the First Monetary Subcommittee of the World Economic Conference discussed ways to raise prices today, a new problem arose due to differences of opinion between Chamberlain and Coughton, which will be studied by the conference. The question is whether world prices can be fully increased before reducing international commercial debts, or whether debts must be reorganized first before joint efforts can be made to raise prices. Chamberlain believed that world prices were already on an upward path and that the need for debt reduction may be reduced in the future after prices have generally risen. Coughton argued that prices can never be fully increased to balance existing international debts. Therefore, prices must be increased and debts must be reduced. Both must be carried out at the same time to succeed. Coughton then explained the US government's plan to raise prices, saying that he knew that Europeans believed that the US would inflate the currency to raise prices, but this path is not the main road. The US government believes that the fundamental goal is to increase production and consumption, so that prices can rise and purchasing power can also increase. He then explained that two-thirds of the raw materials used in the US are imported duty-free, and the federal unemployment relief program can increase the demand for raw materials. Coughton advocated that creditors organize an international agency to study and propose methods to reduce debts. Chamberlain believed that this matter should be negotiated directly between creditors and debtors (according to the US attitude toward war debts, it is the same as Chamberlain's proposal). Chamberlain also wanted an international agency, but insisted that it should be purely advisory and should not be given the power to conclude agreements, saying that Britain could not allow international groups to supervise its debts and its general relations. Chamberlain then discussed the relationship between national debts and general debts, advising countries to be more cautious in issuing public bonds in the future and to pay attention to the appropriate protection of subscribers. Both agreed that it would be very difficult to find a satisfactory solution to commercial debts. Coughton also stated that the US or other creditor countries' willingness to reduce debt should not be regarded as an invitation for debtors to rely on debt. Debt must be reduced only if the debtor is unable to repay it. According to the original hope of the representatives today that Chamberlain would express Britain's attitude towards the US proposal to encourage countries to adopt domestic programs to reduce unemployment and raise prices, but the two sides only debated the issue of commercial debt, Chamberlain stated that the British representatives still need to study the US proposal, which disappointed other representatives (National Telegram, 26th).</p>
<p>London The monetary sub-committee of the Economic Conference met to discuss the debt issue, British Chancellor Chamberlain briefly explained the position of the creditor countries to answer the opinions raised by the debtor countries, briefly saying "In recent years, the history of foreign loans has not made the lending countries have credit, and the disappearance of credit has made the capital problem upside down" Chamberlain then expressed sympathy to the debtor countries, especially to the countries that export raw materials and agricultural products. Chamberlain believed that raising prices is the best and permanent way to relieve the debt problem. As for the application method, he advocated that the debtor and creditor countries sign bilateral agreements, but for it to succeed, it is more appropriate for the representatives of the creditor countries to organize a fair consulting agency so that all parties can be satisfied, but this agency has no arbitral nature. Chamberlain believes that bringing all creditors together regardless of national boundaries will inevitably lead to useless disputes, which is contrary to the opinion of the Hungarian representative Onai. Chamberlain finally said that the countries had previously provided assistance to the debtor countries and can still provide new assistance in the future. He hoped that the debtor countries will do their best to live up to the credit of the countries (Havas, 26th).</p>

<p>London Today, Italian and French representatives fully supported the policy of British Chancellor Chamberlain yesterday, which stated that temporary reorganization should be given to international commercial debts when necessary and did not approve of the permanent reduction proposal held by US representative Coughton. French Finance Minister Ponet stated that France always supports the policy of reorganizing debts to stabilize currencies, believing that there is no need to reduce international commercial debts, only generous conditions need to be adopted. Under this kind of action, it is expected that the wheels of commerce will be started and trust will be restored. However, when fulfilling debts, debtors should be given sufficient opportunities to restore their normal economic conditions. Creditors must assist debtors and give them the greatest convenience in export trade. Coughton also strongly requested to stabilize currencies. He believed that it is rare to have permanent success unless all countries stabilize currencies together. The president of the Swiss National Bank, SARASIN, also fully supported Chamberlain's proposal. After Sarasit's speech, the subcommittee made a brief general debate and elected a drafting committee to draft a proposal, and adjourned at 11:45 am (National Telegram, 27th).</p>

<p>Advocating Reduction of Legal Gold Reserves</p>
<p>London This morning, the World Economic Conference had a very interesting development. The expert committee of the Monetary Committee has passed a resolution, advocating that gold coins and gold coupons should not be circulated domestically, and advocating that the consistent gold reserve of the central bank should not exceed 25%. However, this kind of flexibility should not be used as an excuse to excessively expand the quantity of banknotes and credit. This proposal will be submitted to the Second Subcommittee (Reuters, 27th).</p>

<p>Chairman Resolves Indian Representative's Opinions</p>
<p>London The Silver Subcommittee was originally scheduled to continue its meeting this morning, but it has been postponed until the afternoon so that Chairman Pitman can first have a private meeting with Indian representative Hecht, because after a brief talk between Pitman and Hecht yesterday afternoon, it was discovered that Hecht's speech, which he plans to give at the meeting this morning, has opinions that are very different from Pitman's and are easy to cause a split in the committee (National Telegram, 27th).</p>

<p>London The representatives of the main countries that signed the sugar production and sales agreement in Brussels previously met here today to discuss the Cuban representative's proposal to the Economic Conference to limit sugar production. At the beginning of the discussion, the Australian representative expressed opposition, saying that since the overproduction of sugar has not been proven, Australia cannot approve of limiting the production of sugar. French representative Sarrot said that a committee must be organized to draft a draft in clearer language for detailed discussion. Subsequently, the Cuban representative proposed a proposal to stabilize sugar prices (National Telegram, 26th).</p>

<p>Close Collusion Between Britain, Germany, and Japan</p>
<p>Moscow Soviet news circles have already understood the anti-Soviet actions expressed in the recent developments of the London World Economic Conference. This kind of action is reflected in the proposal of the Anglo-German commercial agreement proposed by Germany and in the speeches made by German representative Bose and British and Japanese representatives in the branch committees regarding the issue of most-favored-nation treatment. The Red Army newspaper "Krasnaya Svanstad" stated that the plan proposed by Germany to open up the Soviet market in the middle and Bose's anti-Soviet speech gave a clever supplement to the Hugenberg memorandum, and made the theory of interventionism in the memorandum more developed and specific. The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" declared that the Soviet Union will find a way to express that the Soviet market should be handled by the Soviet Union itself, and there is no need to trouble other countries from afar. It also pointed out that in the Geneva Conference eleven years ago, the attempt to set an agreement for handling the Soviet market was first revealed, but it still encountered a tragic failure at that time. The Communist Party newspaper Pravda also said that Bose's speech is enough to prove the anti-Soviet nature of the Hugenberg memorandum. The newspaper declared, "German fascism is promoting its anti-Soviet plan in London because London can provide the most suitable atmosphere for the development and growth of this plan. This point is also proven by the speeches of British and Japanese representatives." The newspaper continued, "This kind of combination of Britain, Germany, and Japan is by no means accidental, destroying and showing its essential trend, and expressing the leading role of British imperialism, which is trying to incite Japan against the Soviet Union." Pravda concluded, "German fascism is engaged in adventurous actions again and again. Only those who are dizzy can think of establishing a sphere of influence in the Soviet Union, but they can try it." (TASS, 26th)</p>

<p>Japanese Government to Appoint Representative for Negotiations with India</p>
<p>Mombasa, British Territory of Kenya, 26th: It has been decided to impose new high tariffs on imported cotton products and other goods. (26th, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corporation dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch: The British colony of Kenya in British East Africa is planning to increase tariffs. The British protectorate of Uganda and the British mandated territory of Tanganyika, which have formed a customs union, will also implement tariff increases. This violates the principle of equal opportunity for development in Africa, including the Congo Treaty area. The Japanese government may lodge a protest on this basis. Last year, Japan's trade with East Africa amounted to 15 million in exports and 3.3 million in imports. (27th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Kenya, a British territory, is raising tariffs. After the European War, Japan participated in the Congo Treaty based on the principle of equal opportunity to develop Africa. Therefore, it has the right to protest the tariff increase. The Japanese government is likely to lodge a serious protest with Britain. (27th, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corporation dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today's regular cabinet meeting officially decided on the Japanese representatives to attend the Simla Conference and announced the following appointments: Minister Plenipotentiary Setsuzo Sawada and Shin Terao, Director of the Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, will serve as Japanese representatives to the Simla Conference. Negotiations are underway with the Chairman of the Textile Federation, Bojiro Abe, as the private sector representative. (27th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government's instructions to be taken to the Simla Conference were reported today at the regular cabinet meeting by Foreign Minister Uchida and Commerce Minister Nakajima, and approval has been obtained. Foreign Minister Uchida will formally hand them over to the two representatives soon. The main points of the instructions are generally as follows: The Japanese government intends to negotiate with the Indian government to conclude a Japan-India treaty or extend the validity of existing treaties based on reciprocity and most-favored-nation treatment as conditions for adjusting current and future relations. If a formal treaty cannot be concluded, a de facto provisional agreement including the following points regarding Japan-India commercial, navigation, and tariff relations will be sought, pledging to conclude a formal treaty in the future. In light of the economic conditions in Japan and India, mutual recognition and restrictions on most-favored-nation treatment will be considered. Mutually beneficial measures will be sought for goods imported and exported by both sides. For example, the Indian government should reduce tariffs on cotton products and consider the allocation of imports. The Japanese government guarantees the allocation of Indian cotton imports and considers reducing tariffs on pig iron and other items. The Imperial government will encourage the control of exports by private businesses, and the Indian government should follow suit to show sincerity. If Japan-India trade relations break down, the responsibility lies with India. (27th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Moscow: In an exchange of views between Japanese Ambassador Ota and Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Sokolnikov, it was revealed that the Japanese Ryufu torpedo boat recently disregarded the lack of consent from the Soviet government, entered Soviet waters off Kamchatka, and claimed to be investigating the fact that Soviet coastal guards shot and killed three Japanese fishermen on June 10. It even landed a team of personnel on Soviet territory. On June 21, Ota protested to Sokolnikov regarding the shooting of three fishermen at Kronotsky Cape in the Kamchatka Peninsula, as claimed by Ota, and requested that Sokolnikov allow the secretary of the Japanese consulate in Petropavlovsk to board the Ryufu torpedo boat and go to the scene to verify the shooting. Sokolnikov told Ota that the Soviet government had not yet received a report on this matter. If the facts are as Ota said, the perpetrators will be identified and appropriately punished. However, Sokolnikov resolutely rejected the suggestion that the secretary of the Japanese consulate travel to the scene on a warship. Finally, he and Ota agreed that the secretary could be sent by civilian ship, and at the same time, local Soviet authorities were immediately instructed to go to the scene to conduct an investigation. This shows that a proper way to resolve the dispute has been jointly established by Sokolnikov and Ota regarding the protest raised by Japan regarding this incident. However, the Ryufu torpedo boat, without waiting for the results of the Soviet investigation or the arrival of the secretary of the Japanese consulate, immediately penetrated waters within Soviet territory and landed a team of personnel, arbitrarily surveying the coastline on Soviet territory. Sokolnikov and Ota have already discussed this action. The Soviet protest is as follows: "According to the Soviet government's preliminary investigation, there are no Soviet coastal guards in the deserted Kronotsky Cape area. Therefore, the Soviet government is deeply perplexed by the Japanese government's protest regarding the shooting of three Japanese fishermen by Soviet coastal guards in that area. The Soviet government has not continued to receive reports sufficient to confirm the shooting. However, if a subsequent investigation confirms the facts claimed by Ota and establishes the guilt of Soviet citizens, the criminals will undoubtedly be properly punished. But at present, the Soviet government has not yet verified this matter. At the same time, the Soviet government feels it necessary to seriously protest the actions of the Japanese torpedo boat, which violated strict and indisputable legal norms. This action makes it difficult for the Soviet authorities responsible for investigating the alleged killing of three fishermen (if such an incident did occur). At the same time, the Soviet government cannot help but express its surprise at the denial made by the Director of the Eurasian Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Spier van Neck, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo, on June 20 that the torpedo boat had entered Soviet territorial waters. What surprises the Soviet Union even more is the falsehood in the report made by the Director of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to foreign journalists. He said that on June 21, the Japanese Ambassador in Moscow had reported to the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs that the Japanese torpedo boat had entered Soviet territorial waters. In fact, regarding this action that has already caused the Soviet government to lodge a serious protest, the Soviet government has not received any report from the Japanese Embassy. The fact is that it was heard from the statement of the Director of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs," etc. (26th, TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Soviet Union has lodged a counter-protest against the entry of the Japanese destroyer Tachikaze into Russian territorial waters, claiming it violated international law. Japanese naval authorities categorically refuted this, saying that the Tachikaze rushed to the area to search for the perpetrators and collect corpses after receiving an urgent report from the Fumimaru that it was under unlawful fire from the Soviet Union. They also obtained evidence. When a fishing boat is in danger, the patrol ship naturally has the duty to provide protection. Its actions were entirely an exercise of the right to self-defense. If the Soviet Union does not show sincerity and ignores this incident, the Navy will increase the deployment of patrol ships and take active patrol actions to protect Japanese fishing boats by force.

<p>▲ Paris dispatch, 26th (National news agency): The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, met with French Foreign Minister Pongou today. They reached an agreement regarding the postponement of the Disarmament Conference. Henderson will submit this proposal to the core committee in Geneva and advocate for a postponement until after the League of Nations conference in September or October.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva dispatch, 27th (Havas news agency): Work on the Disarmament Conference has resumed. The Presidium is scheduled to meet at 3 PM this afternoon. There is much debate in the conference lounge. After exchanging opinions, the majority of delegations favor postponing the Disarmament Conference. The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, also expressed the same view. The U.S. delegation appears to be unconcerned about the disarmament issue, believing that the European countries should decide on their own. This attitude indicates that the U.S. position has changed, as not long ago, the U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, actively participated in disarmament efforts. As for Germany, it will continue to oppose postponing the Disarmament Conference. However, this is the second time Germany has opposed the postponement, and even the German delegation does not believe that its opposition will be taken seriously in Geneva. Furthermore, the League of Nations Secretariat issued a statement claiming that it had received approximately seventy telegrams from various parts of Germany, all reporting the issue of unidentified aircraft flying in German airspace. All parties are paying close attention to this statement. The "National Daily" published an article commenting on this matter, stating that the publication of this statement was a formal order from the highest level. The League of Nations Secretariat attaches such importance to the seventy telegrams from Germany, but countless petitions from people everywhere to the League of Nations, recounting the brutal acts of the current German regime, have been ignored. How can there be such inconsistency and contradiction in the world? The League of Nations has not yet issued a statement regarding the atrocities of the current German regime, but now, before the reopening of the Disarmament Conference, it is discussing Germany's demand for rearmament, allowing armies that specialize in massacring defenseless people to achieve their desires. The intentions are beyond our comprehension.</p>
<p>▲ Paris dispatch, 26th (Havas news agency): British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Eden, is traveling to Geneva to attend the Presidium meeting of the Disarmament Conference. In addition, the head of the British Affairs Office of the League of Nations, Ketogen, is also traveling to Geneva with Eden. The two visited Foreign Minister Pongou here this evening, and Pongou granted them an audience.</p>
<p>▲ London dispatch, 27th (Reuters news agency): Baldwin denied in the House of Commons today that the London talks on the Disarmament Conference have been abandoned, stating that these talks have only been temporarily delayed due to the activities of the World Economic Conference. The British government firmly believes that these talks are necessary for the good progress of the Disarmament Conference. As for the rumors that the opening date of the conference will be postponed until the autumn, this remains to be confirmed.</p>

<p>▲ Berlin dispatch, 26th (Reuters news agency): The National Socialist Party government is now vigorously pursuing its plan to seize all power, from politics and religion to sports groups and youth associations. Its management must be completely controlled. The implementation is active, and no resistance has been encountered. Many people have been arrested throughout the country. By the end of this week, hundreds of important figures from the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Steel Helmet League, the Bavarian People's Party, and Catholics have been imprisoned. However, the Catholics were released due to the intervention of Bishop Speyer. Dr. Goebbels, the Propaganda Minister of the Hitler government, told members of the National Socialist Party today that the revolution of the National Socialist Party can only end after the National Socialist Party obtains national power.</p>
<p>Christian and Marxist trade unions are unnecessary, as the National Socialist Party itself will work for the welfare of the workers. The National Association of Shopkeepers and Tanners was originally scheduled to meet in Berlin, with Hugenberg as the main speaker, but the authorities banned the meeting today without announcing the reason. According to news circulating here tonight, Hugenberg has requested to be relieved of his government duties.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin dispatch, 26th (Havas news agency): The government has arrested many Socialists. Former Premier of Brunswick, Socialist Jasper, has recently been arrested. Twelve leaders of the Socialist Party in Hanover have been arrested.</p>
<p>▲ Munich dispatch, 26th (Reuters news agency): The National Socialist Party has decided to dissolve the opposition parties in Bavaria. Today, members of the Bavarian People's Party in the National Assembly and the Bavarian State Assembly were arrested because the leaders of the People's Party have clearly refused to dissolve voluntarily, hence the arrests. Today, members of the People's Party were surrounded and arrested, including many prominent figures.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin dispatch, 26th (National news agency): The effort to purge the remnants of the Social Democratic Party and the Bavarian People's Party is still ongoing. Hundreds of former Social Democratic Party officials were arrested on Sunday and Monday. However, many were released after being questioned by the police. According to the Munich police chief, the arrests were made because documents were found during searches of private residences, proving the secret collusion between the Bavarian People's Party and the Austrian government, and that the party had violated government orders by holding illegal meetings and publishing newspapers.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva dispatch, 26th (Reuters news agency): The League of Nations Secretariat has received no fewer than seventy protests from municipal governments and individuals in various parts of Germany regarding the strange aircraft discovered in Berlin several days ago and the incident of distributing leaflets attacking the German government. Many of them demand that Germany's air defense capabilities be equal to those of other countries. A powerful delegation arrived here today from Berlin to express strong opposition to the postponement of the Disarmament Conference until autumn.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva dispatch, 26th (National news agency): The Secretariat of the Disarmament Conference announced today that it had received no fewer than seventy protest documents from German cities, groups, and individuals regarding the strange aircraft in Berlin last week. Some demanded that other countries take action to protect Germany from encountering such aircraft again, while others demanded that Germany be granted aviation equality for self-defense. It is anticipated that Germany will demand the establishment of an air force when the Disarmament Conference reconvenes.</p>

<p>▲ Oslo dispatch, 26th (National news agency): Norway's leading agricultural newspaper, "Countryman of Bærum," today published an editorial advocating that this year's Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to German President Hindenburg. The newspaper stated that Hindenburg is the only suppressor of chaos in today's turbulent world. Not only was he the greatest, noblest, and most emotional figure during the European War, but among the famous figures in today's world, he stands out like a crane among chickens. The newspaper further stated that the Nobel Prize must be awarded to such a great figure in order to enhance the value of the prize. Although the efforts of the Italian Prime Minister for peace should also be awarded a prize, it can be postponed until next year.</p>

<p>Ji Hongchang's Troops Advance in Five Routes Towards Kangbao</p>
<p>Liu Guitang Defects and Leads Troops to Guyuan</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: Since the 21st, the atmosphere in the Zhangjiakou area has suddenly changed, with active plans for resistance against Japan. Feng Yuxiang, in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, appointed Li Zhenwu as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route Anti-Japanese Army and Ji Hongchang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Front. Ji carried his entourage to Zhangjiakou early on the 22nd to deploy everything, arrived at noon, and immediately organized the General Headquarters in Zhangbei, took the oath of office, and issued an inaugural telegram. His troops are divided into five routes: the first route is Deng Wen's, the second route is Li Zhongyi's, the third route is Zhou Rongxuan's, the fourth route is Nie Yuling's, and the fifth route is Hu Yunshan's. Deng Wen and other troops are currently concentrating in Zhangbei and will advance towards Kangbao and Baochang in the near future, preparing to recover Duolun. Fang Zhenwu is still in Zhangjiakou, discussing with Feng. Fang's division under Zhang Renjie opened to the vicinity of Zhangjiakou a few days ago and is also preparing to advance towards the Zhangdu Avenue. If necessary, Fang will also go to the front to inspect. The cavalry army under Zhao Chengshou, originally stationed in Zhangbei, has been ordered by the Beiping Military Branch Council to be stationed in Nanhouchang, which is between Kangbao and Shangdu, about three hundred li from Zhangbei. They are currently relocating. Zhao himself is still in Zhangbei and will inspect the cavalry stationed there in Pingdiquan after his troops have completed their departure.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Japanese army has been carrying out an invasion plan for Chahar. On the one hand, they are reinforcing troops in Duolun, and on the other hand, they are instigating rebel troops such as Liu Guitang and Cui Xinwu to advance westward and create disturbances, in order to achieve their poisonous plan of using Chinese to control Chinese. After Liu Guitang led his troops to occupy Baochang and Kangbao, they did not advance. At this time, Feng Yuxiang established the Anti-Japanese position in Zhangjiakou, uniting various armies and advocating resistance against Japan. Liu repeatedly sent personnel to express his surrender. Finally, he sent his Deputy Army Commander Shang Wu to Zhangjiakou to meet with Feng and explain everything, saying that Liu was isolated from the main army in Northern Shandong, and in order to preserve his strength and slowly plan to serve the country, he feigned cooperation with the Japanese army. Since entering Chahar, he has been oppressed by the Japanese army and has not been understood by the national army, and he has no way to justify himself. Now, he is willing to lead his troops to listen to commands and unite to resist Japan. Feng said that he was taking on the task of resisting Japan from the standpoint of the people, and if they could share the same ideals, they could turn enemies into friends. The negotiations between the two sides were quite satisfactory. Now, Feng and Liu have agreed that Liu will give up the defense area around Baochang and Kangbao, which will be stationed by Feng's troops, in order to facilitate the recovery of Duolun. Liu's troops will then open to Guyuan to attack Rehexi. On the morning of the 23rd, the troops of Liu Guitang around Kangbao and Baochang moved towards Guyuan. The various armies of Feng's Ji Hongchang and Deng Wen, as well as the reorganized volunteer army, are concentrating in Zhangbei, preparing to be stationed in Kangbao and Baochang, etc., to realize the recovery of the lost land in Eastern Chahar and directly attack Duolun. The Japanese army in Duolun is stationed with a cavalry unit under Motegi, as well as more than 2,000 rebel troops under Cui Xingwu. The military strength is weak. The rebel troops under Cui also have a tendency to surrender and have sent representatives to contact Ji Hongchang. To what extent the situation in Eastern Chahar will develop in the future will be clear during the most knowledgeable period. (Arrived on the 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Yangtze River Water Level Stabilizes <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Wuhan Still Submerged; Dikes in Various Counties in Danger</p>
<p>General Headquarters Orders Flood Control Personnel to Diligently Attend to Their Duties</p>
<p>Police Department Forbids Digging of Dikes; Violators to Be Executed on the Spot</p>
<p>Provincial Government Requests Economic Council to Issue 200,000 in Flood Control Funds</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: For half a month, the water level of the Yangtze River at various ports has been increasing without decreasing. It only gradually stabilized on the 25th. Hankou and Hanyang only each saw a four-inch rise in water level. On the 26th, Hankou maintained a water mark of 47 feet and 2 inches, with no rise or fall compared to the 25th. Chongqing was at 30 feet and 8 inches, Yichang at 32 feet and 4 inches, Changsha at 24 feet and 7 inches, Yuezhou at 49 feet and 1 inch, Shashi at 28 feet, and Jiujiang at 44 feet and 2 inches. The water levels were the same as on the 25th. Downstream, Wuhu and Zhenjiang each rose by 4 inches, which is not surprising as the water is receding. However, the clear weather suddenly turned cloudy and rainy. If it continues for several days, the water source will increase again. Whether the disaster situation will expand in the future is not something that can be predicted at this time. Wuhan and the three towns are still in the vast floodwaters as the water has not receded slightly. The dikes and sluices in the suburbs are still not out of danger and are currently being protected separately by the Flood Control Association, the Construction Department, and the Municipal Government. If the water does not rise any further, there should be no worries. The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters has issued a notice to various garrison agencies and troops to strictly patrol the various dike projects. If any malicious individuals are found stealing and digging into the dikes, they will be executed on the spot. In various counties, in addition to the early collapse of the Jinshui New Dam and the Zhang Daonan Dike in Shishou, the Xinchun, Sanxing, and Yagong dikes have also continued to collapse. In addition, the water level of the main dikes of Jianli Chewan and the Xin Dike Jingjiang is higher than the dikes, and there are many leaks. The Du Long Dike and Great Wall in Huanggang are too heavily impacted and are all in danger. The Mahua Dike and Jingjiang Dike, which are related to the livelihood of seven counties in three provinces, are especially precarious. Representatives from Susong, Huangmei, Jiujiang, Pengze, Guangji, Taihu, and Wangjiang sent telegrams to the governments of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui on the 26th, requesting that Commander-in-Chief Chiang be telegraphed to order the National Economic Council to quickly allocate large sums of money to carry out rescue work. The telegram stated, "To the Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Xia; the Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Xiong; and the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, Liu Junjian: Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been torrential rain, and the river has been soaring. The water has risen more than a foot in one day and one night. Currently, the Jingjiang and Mahua dikes are submerged by as much as six to seven feet. It is difficult for these unconsolidated sand dikes to withstand the waves of the south wind. If the water rises again, it will inevitably overflow the dikes and rush straight in. Then the refugees in the seven counties of the three provinces will once again be buried in the belly of the fish. The association has personally supervised nearby residents, patrolling day and night, and devising ways to protect them. For this reason, a report is made to urgently request that Commander-in-Chief Chiang be telegraphed to order the National Economic Committee to order the engineering bureaus of Anhui and Jiangxi to bring funds to the dikes and rebuild them as before to save the emergency and focus on the dikes. The surviving people of the three provinces and seven counties are grateful for the vast contributions. Wu Xiaoyun, Chairman of the Susong Jingma Dike Construction Committee; Wu Shangda, representative of the Huangmei Jiang Dike; Zhuo Er, representative of the Jiujiang Jiang Dike; Hong Chunmao, representative of the Pengze Jiang Dike; Wang Qing, representative of the Guangji Jiang Dike; Yu Jiude, representative of the Taihu Jiang Dike; and Yang Ren, representative of the Wangjiang Jiang Dike."</p>

<p>=The Assassin Was the Gunner on the Zhenhai Warship=</p>
<p>Several Shots Fired at Shen All Missed</p>
<p>Feng Zhichong Fell into the Sea but Was Still Arrested=</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Yesterday (the 24th) at 4:40 PM, Shen Honglie, the Mayor of Qingdao and Commander of the Bohai Fleet, after participating in the swimming preliminaries at the Qianhai, accompanied by his adjutant Shi Liangzuo, took a car to the Second Pier for inspection. The Zhenhai warship belonging to the Bohai Fleet was moored at the Fourth Pier, and a small steam launch was dispatched to the shore to welcome Shen aboard. While en route, Feng Zhichong (33 years old, from Liaoning), the gunner on the warship, suddenly used a box gun with live ammunition to shoot at Shen in the cabin. Fortunately, Adjutant Shi spotted him and immediately threw Feng into the sea. After falling into the sea, Feng continued to fire three shots at the small steam launch, all of which missed. Feng was then arrested and taken to the Naval Headquarters for strict interrogation. No reliable confession has yet been obtained. It is not yet known whether there is a political background to this matter. Shen still went to the Zhenhai warship to give a speech, which ended at 6:00 PM. He remained unusually calm and returned to his residence safely. After this incident, a special curfew was temporarily imposed in the Dagang area, and all idlers entering and leaving the pier were subjected to thorough searches. There was a disturbance for half the night, but no further clues were obtained. However, according to news from the municipal government, the assassin had old grudges with Adjutant Shi and intended to attack Shi this time to avenge his past grievances, but mistakenly targeted Shen.

<p>Recently, people's hearts are not as they used to be, and the customs of the world have changed greatly. In Taoxingqiao Laotu, this city, there was a case of an apprentice in a dyeing workshop raping a young girl. The apprentice is from Nanjing, 18 years old. On the evening of the 26th, he suddenly became lustful and tricked Chen Jifang, a 12-year-old girl in the workshop, into being raped, injuring her lower body and causing unstoppable bleeding. After her family discovered this, they inquired about the situation and sent the injured girl to Deqiong Hospital for treatment. It is said that her uterus was injured. The apprentice, knowing that he had caused trouble, also disappeared without a trace. It is said that the apprentice has a close relationship with the workshop owner, and they will seriously negotiate with the apprentice's family.</p>

<p>Shipping Industry Protests Defense Levy</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Government decided at a county government meeting to levy a defense fee of five cents per yuan on all passenger ships starting on July 1st and instructed the county chamber of commerce to notify each ship separately. A notice has also been issued. After receiving the notice, the shipping companies believed that the shipping industry depends entirely on freight transportation. In recent years, the market has been declining and has been greatly affected. In addition, the round-trip discounts of trains have led to a rush to road transportation by merchants. The rural economy is declining, and there are fewer passengers on rural routes. If another five cents per yuan is levied on tickets, it will inevitably become impossible to survive. They are especially afraid that this will set a precedent. They immediately convened an emergency meeting. Everyone agreed that this matter concerns the lifeline of the shipping industry and that, according to Article 6 of the Temporary Regulations on Revising and Supervising Local Finance promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, regulations that hinder traffic taxes and levies should not be implemented, and that the levy should be stopped. Yesterday, they sent separate telegrams to the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, as well as the Ministry of Communications, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Construction Department, requesting a swift stop to maintain the industry.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Xi Dejiong Telegrams That the Dangerous Situation in Wuhan Has Passed <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Downstream is Critical; Sends Personnel with Materials to the Rescue</p>
<p>Main Dikes Are Solid and Intact; No Damage</p>
<p>This year's early summer flood has caused the water level of the Jianghan to rise daily, setting a new record for the highest water level in the same month in sixty years. Hubei Province, with its rivers and lakes, is most concerned about flooding and relies entirely on dikes for protection. Xi Dejiong, the Chief of the Engineering Department of the National Economic Council, flew to Wuhan the previous week to inspect dike construction and supervise the Jianghan Engineering Bureau in handling flood control matters, establishing an office within the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to personally guide everything. Yesterday, Xi telegraphed the National Economic Council in Shanghai, reporting that the main dikes he built were undamaged when the water was not rising and that the downstream was critical. The original telegram is recorded as follows (title omitted): "Amid the rising waters, Wuhan and its surrounding areas frequently report dangerous situations. However, the main dikes are as solid and intact as before, with no areas submerged. Flood control work is nearing completion, and the water situation is gradually easing. The flood control dikes and the Zhanggong Dike are still eight feet to more than ten feet above the water surface. The Longwang Temple above the Customs is two feet to five feet above. Only the Jiang'an of the Special Zone and the concession is almost at the same level. The beaches of Baisha Island above Wuchang and Parrot Island in Hanyang (all outside the dikes) have been flooded, but the dikes are also intact. The water level here has been flat since yesterday. The dangerous situation upstream has passed. The areas around Fankou and Tuanfeng downstream are still in critical condition. Reliable personnel have been dispatched with materials to assist in the rescue." (Omitted below) In addition, the Economic Committee did not receive water level reports from Hankou and Jiujiang yesterday. Only Wuhu telegraphed that the water level at 7:00 AM was 27.4 feet, continuing to rise by more than two feet from the previous day.</p>

<p>Once Assembly is Complete</p>
<p>Naming Ceremony to Be Scheduled</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Junkers aircraft ordered from Germany by Tianchu MSG Factory arrived in Shanghai on the 20th. Due to import passport procedures, it could not be immediately retrieved. These procedures have now been completed, and the factory has submitted a request to the Aviation Association for acceptance. The Aviation Association has forwarded the request to the Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Military Affairs, which has dispatched personnel to accept the aircraft. The aircraft components have been transported by the Aviation Association to Hongqiao Airport, where personnel from the Junkers factory are responsible for assembly. It is expected to be completed within a week. Once the procedures are completed, an aviation technology demonstration will be held at Jiangwan Racecourse, with flight experts from Eurasia Aviation Corporation, hired by the German Junkers factory, in charge. A naming ceremony will also be held at that time, inviting people from all walks of life to participate in marking the grand event. As for the price of the aircraft, all accounts have not yet been settled, so it cannot be definitively stated. It is estimated to be over 100,000 Shanghai General Silver Dollars. According to the person in charge of the factory, the factory is willing to be responsible for repaying any amount lacking in addition to the 100,000 dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Effectiveness of Telegraph Trunk Line Improvement <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Increased Efficiency in Communications with Hubei and Fujian</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Hua Shijian, the Business Director of the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, yesterday morning. He spoke in great detail about the improvement of the Shanghai-Hankou trunk line, the Chongqing branch line, and the measures taken to prevent damage to the trunk line during the heavy floods. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e101">Route Improvement <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>It is said that the Ministry of Communications has been paying close attention to the work of improving routes recently. Three lines have been completed: 1) The Shanghai-Hankou trunk line. Communication between Shanghai and Hankou is one of the most developed telegraph lines in the country, with daily revenue of over 2,000 yuan. Therefore, the position of this line is also extremely important. The line is a duplex system, capable of sending and receiving 100 words each per minute. However, sometimes due to current leakage, it often cannot send and receive in both directions, but only in one direction, which delays the time considerably. The Ministry of Communications specially dispatched Chief Engineer Zhao Lusheng to Shanghai to send personnel to actively repair it. It has now been completely repaired, and the development of telegraph services will no longer be hindered. 2) The Chongqing branch line. The section from Badong to Wushan, about 100 li long, was destroyed by bandits in Sichuan province three years ago. Due to the lack of bandit suppression, it was impossible to repair it. After the bandits were wiped out in January this year, personnel were immediately sent to repair it. The loss was about 50,000 yuan. A report was received yesterday that the line has been repaired, and communication from Hankou to Chongqing can now be directly achieved. 3) The Shanghai-Fujian line. The line from Shanghai to Fujian is subject to moisture and blockage every year during the rainy season. After the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to repair it, the same problems have not occurred this year after the rainy season began.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Flood Prevention <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>It is also said that during the floods of the previous years, many telegraph lines on the Shanghai-Hankou trunk line were damaged by the floods. Since this month, there have been continuous heavy rains and flash floods. Although it has not yet become a major disaster, the situation is also very dangerous. Therefore, in order to prevent problems before they occur, the Ministry of Communications ordered the original four engineers stationed along the line from Shanghai to Zhenjiang, from Zhenjiang to Wuhu, from Wuhu to Jiujiang, and from Jiujiang to Xingguo Wuxue to the terminal point of Hankou, to lead the staff to inspect the line in rotation every five days. As of today, no damage has occurred. However, most of the telegraph poles are planted along the riverbank. If the water level continues to rise and the embankment is not strong and is washed away by the water, the telegraph poles planted on the embankment will also be difficult to avoid falling.</p>
<h3 id="e103">North China Telegraph <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Ministry of Communications has long been preparing to restore the North China telegraph after the withdrawal of the Japanese troops. However, the Japanese and puppet troops are still lingering and have not withdrawn, so there is no way to start. Therefore, to this day, the North China telegraph can only reach as far east as Lutai and as far northwest as Miyun. The coastal lines from Kaiping Xugezhuang and other places have still not been restored. Therefore, this can only be started depending on the withdrawal situation of the Japanese troops.</p>

<p>Responding to Taikoo Dockyard Strike</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the strike of the Nan Hua and other steamers of Taikoo Dockyard in Guangdong has lasted for two weeks and there is still no proper solution. The Ningbo seamen also sent a telegram yesterday to respond. The New Beijing Steamer also went on strike in Ningbo last night. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ningbo Responds After the strike broke out in Guangdong, the Guangdong Seamen's Association sent telegrams to seamen in various places, urging them to assist in the negotiations. Yesterday, the Ningbo Seamen's Association sent a telegram to the Wusong Merchant Steamer Tragedy Relief Association, saying: Ningbo agrees to respond, please send personnel to Ningbo to assist as soon as possible. Yang Yuting of the Ningbo Seamen's Association respectfully requests.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Ningbo After receiving the report, the Wusong Steamer Tragedy Relief Association immediately selected Zheng Yuqing, the representative of the Changxing Steamer, and Gao Yongliu, a worker from the Wusong Steamer Disaster, to take the Ningshao Steamer Company's ship to Ningbo at 3:00 PM to report on the progress of the negotiations in Guangdong and assist in the proceedings.</p>
<p>Commercial Assistance The association also believed that the Taikoo Dockyard strike was becoming increasingly serious, and the livelihoods of the workers on the ships after the strike were worrying. Therefore, it held a meeting at the association's headquarters yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter. More than 70 people, including Lu Shuangxi from Anqing, Jiang Yu, Wang Jiansheng, Shi He, and Wu Shengqing, attended. Lu Bianxi chaired the meeting. Representatives from various ships stated that they were determined to resist for a long time, and the workers on various ships were willing to provide financial assistance. They vowed not to give up until a satisfactory result was achieved.</p>
<p>Strike Occurs After the Ningbo Seamen's Association sent a telegram to respond, at 5:00 PM last night, the New Beijing Steamer in Ningbo went on strike just as it was about to set sail. The shipowner urgently telegraphed the company for instructions. Passengers on board refunded their tickets. The company plans to entrust the cargo to China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao and other ships for transportation. The ship moved to the outer anchorage, and the situation was very tense.</p>

<p>Telegram to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the resolution of the Fourth General Assembly, requested the abolition of fishery construction fees. The original text is as follows: A submission regarding the matter of requesting. According to the proposal of the Shanghai Fresh Fish Trade Association, the method of collecting fishery construction fees is complicated and harsh. Please submit to the central government to order its abolition. When it was brought up for discussion, it was unanimously agreed that since the Jianghai District Fishery Improvement Association planned to implement fishery construction fees, collection personnel have been harassing everywhere. This matter has repeatedly been petitioned by the Jiashan County Preserved Fish and Meat Industry and the Ningbo Fresh and Salted Goods Industry Associations. In May, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Industry to request it to stop the fees, but the order was not approved. Now, according to the previous proposal, the inland fish vendors fundamentally refuse to pay the fees. The collection personnel even use force to detain ships and extort fees, causing fresh fish to rot. Such extortion is like the setting up of toll stations everywhere during the Likin era. How can fish vendors bear this? It was unanimously resolved to submit a request for the abolition of the fees. It is appropriate to submit the matter accordingly, and request your esteemed Yuan (Ministry) to review and approve it, and to issue an order to stop it and order the abolition of the collection office, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. This would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan Ministry of Industry.</p>

<p>Workers Petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, the British-owned Shanghai Tram Company dismissed more than 20 ticket sellers without reason, causing a reaction from all workers and brewing a strike. After the Water and Electricity Industry Union of the Third District petitioned the party and government organs for assistance, the Municipal Party Headquarters sent Zhou Lianze, and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Jintao, together with Luo Bosen, the Chief of Police of the Public Concession, and Gul of the Special Affairs Division, to negotiate with the company, meeting with Mr. Mackie, the General Manager of the company, and Mr. Brooke, the Traffic Superintendent. After discussions between the two parties, it was believed that ticket sellers often steal money, causing great losses to the company, and the bad habit should be fundamentally eliminated. Later, party and government representatives pointed out that workers' wages were meager and their livelihoods were difficult to maintain, so there was theft. Wages should be generally increased, and rules for eliminating theft should be formulated for rectification. The class expressed their approval and agreed to consider and reply. More than 20 dismissed workers, due to livelihood concerns, specially sent ticket sellers No. 261, No. 383, No. 228, No. 176, No. 235, and more than ten others, led by the Water and Electricity Workers' Union of the Third District, to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. Zhou Lianze, the Chief Secretary of the People's Movement Section, received them and said that the company had expressed its willingness to accept mediation, and this case should be resolved soon. Please wait patiently for the solution. The workers were satisfied and returned.</p>

<h3 id="e108">North Sichuan Road House Tax Case, Hongkou Organizations Telegram <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Separately Submitted to the Executive and Supervisory Yuans</p>
<p>Handle According to Law and Uphold Justice</p>
<p>Refute the Finance Bureau Director's Remarks</p>
<p>The Joint Meeting of Representatives of Hongkou Organizations, regarding the North Sichuan Road house tax case, based on the resolution, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan yesterday, reporting that the municipal authorities' collection of house tax was inappropriate, resulting in a market strike, and requesting that justice be upheld. At the same time, it refuted the remarks made by Cai Zengji, the Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau. The details are recorded on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Telegram to the Executive and Supervisory Yuans <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>A submission regarding the administrative chief ordering subordinates to illegally arrest merchants and people, imprisoning innocent people, and fasting for two days. We appeal for handling according to the law. It is found that the area of North Sichuan Road and Des Voeux Road in this city is not a concession. The issue of the cross-border road has been unresolved for a long time, causing the merchants and people there to be in constant fear for the security of their safety. External insults are not taken care of by anyone. Even a slight carelessness will lead to violence. Considering the past facts, no one does not feel pain. However, the patriotism of the merchants and people there has not been released because of this. For example, during the Qi-Lu war in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Public Works Department built walls to block the alleys of North Sichuan Road, and the Public Works Department compiled house numbers. After the Shanghai war, the shops and residents raised more than 900 yuan to help the Second Precinct of the Fifth District move to the nearby concession. This is also the intention of the merchants and people to ask the government to recover the road rights as soon as possible. How should the municipal government plan to fundamentally solve the problem and seek the safety and welfare of the merchants and people? Now, the municipal government is not doing its duty, and suddenly levies taxes. The significance of the relative rights and obligations is not without question. First, the citizens there are mixed with Chinese and foreigners. Regardless of nationality, the rights enjoyed by the municipal administration are the same. The tax obligation is naturally not an exception because of nationality. However, the municipal government only announces for Chinese citizens and not others, and the significance of the relative rights and obligations is not without question. Second, since the land has become a deformed strange phenomenon, whether the tax can be avoided from being duplicated is also a question that the merchants and people should ask. Third, in summary, it is necessary for the merchants and people there to request the municipal government to postpone the tax collection, and there is absolutely no psychology of resisting the tax. The municipal government should respond to this request. However, before the municipal government has officially responded, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has ordered Chen Jiwu, the director of the Second Precinct of the Fifth District, to forcibly collect donations, illegally arrest, and imprison four merchants and people for more than 24 hours, and has not sent them to court. They even cut off their food and drink for two days and nights. Such illegal abuse of power and inhumane behavior can be seen again under the leadership of our National Government. Is it not strange? To be laughed at by foreign countries, to insult the legacy of the late Prime Minister, and to violate the admonitions of Director Wang, there is nothing more than this. The associations and others are closely related and find it difficult to remain silent. It is appropriate to jointly submit a submission, hoping that "Your Yuan will strictly deal with the illegal, and immediately give the Municipal Public Security Bureau Director a corresponding punishment, and dismiss the Fifth District, Second Precinct Director from office for investigation, in order to warn others. This is a public feeling. This is submitted to the Executive Yuan (Your Yuan) to impeach according to the law, in order to warn others. This is a public feeling.

<p>In the recent municipal meeting, in order to solve the tax collection problem of the cross-border road construction in the area of North Sichuan Road and Des Voeux Road, the remarks made by Cai Zengji, the Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, stated that the citizens should have no objection to the relative rights and obligations. According to general common sense, it is in line with national administration and laws. However, the citizens there have a considerable reason for requesting a postponement of the tax collection. Director Cai failed to consider in detail before speaking, and our association expresses deep regret. Regarding the reasons why the citizens there requested a postponement of the tax collection, there are three: 1) The issue of the cross-border road construction has been unresolved for a long time, causing our Chinese merchants and people to be insulted by foreigners from time to time, and they have no way to appeal. Past facts can prove this. 2) The residents there are mixed with Chinese and foreigners. Since the rights to enjoy the municipal administration are the same, the tax obligation is naturally not an exception because of nationality. The municipal government's tax collection announcement only mentions Chinese citizens and not others, which seems unfair. 3) The cross-border disputes have been unresolved for a long time, and the power and responsibility are not unified. Before the citizens have obtained a strong guarantee from the municipal government, they will bear the burden of repeated taxation every day. Director Cai's so-called public security and public use rights, citing the first and second reasons, seems to not recognize this, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Northeast Volunteer Army Telegram Announces Reorganization into Guerrilla Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang People's Support Association Shanghai Communication Office, and other groups received a telegram from Wang Yunping, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast People's Guerrilla Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps, and others from Yanqing. An excerpt is as follows: Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese aggressors have been tyrannical, seizing our land and killing our compatriots. Any young person with a sense of patriotism is filled with grief and indignation. Therefore, the people have risen up to resist. Wang Yunping and others, being natives of the Northeast, felt the pain of national and family ruin. They immediately gathered thousands of iron-willed compatriots and organized armed resistance against Japan. From the battles of Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, and Yushu, they fought fiercely with enemy troops in the Chaoyang and Jianping areas. They engaged in hand-to-hand combat under enemy aircraft and artillery fire more than ten times a day, spilling blood in the wind, sleeping in blood, and chewing on water, risking their lives to recover lost territory and defend the frontier. Unexpectedly, the fall of Chengde affected the overall situation, and the great rivers and mountains were reduced to mere illusions. With tears, we retreated to western Rehe, hoping to make a comeback. (Omitted) Currently, although North China appears to be temporarily stable, the four provinces have been completely lost. Being descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the situation is like heaven and hell. Wang and others are heartbroken by what they see. As long as there is a breath left, how can we ignore it? Therefore, we have re-established contact with capable comrades and reorganized the Northeast People's Guerrilla Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps, lurking in enemy territory, dividing areas, and carrying out guerrilla warfare separately. We will also unite with the people to confront the enemy with non-cooperation and non-compromise, disrupting public order, destroying construction, assassinating traitors, and exterminating Japanese warlords. With a single call, the people will rise up and the morale of the people will be renewed. Like countless needles pricking, how difficult is it to drive out the enemy? Moreover, discipline is strict, and order is well-established. Learning from past mistakes, we hope to achieve future success. From now on, the green gauze curtains will rise, and more and more initiatives will be launched. We hope that compatriots at home and abroad, wise people from all walks of life, will respond in unison and provide guidance so that old and new hatreds can be avenged at the same time. The nation will be fortunate, and the Northeastern compatriots will be fortunate. This telegram is written in tears and cannot fully express what we want to say.

<p>Talks with Feng Still Holding on to Anti-Japanese Aspirations</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Central Committee member Huang Shaogu has just arrived in Shanghai from the Northwest. Yesterday, a reporter met with Huang at his residence and inquired about Mr. Feng Huanzhang's anti-Japanese efforts and the situation of recovering lost territory. According to Huang, Mr. Feng organized the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Allied Army and recovered eastern Chahar. For example, the recovery of Kangbao yesterday was as reported in the newspapers. In short, when Mr. Feng telegraphed to resist Japan, he advocated first recovering the four counties in eastern Chahar. The recovery of Kangbao today is just one of them. Mr. Feng's motivation to insist on resisting Japan is completely pure. The central government has appointed Feng as the director of forestry and land reclamation. Feng personally appreciates the central government's kindness very much, but Feng will never give up his anti-Japanese aspirations because he accepted the position of director of forestry and land reclamation. Therefore, Feng is still recovering lost territory in eastern Chahar with an unwavering spirit and has not changed his plan. As for those who criticize Feng for recovering the four counties in eastern Chahar without mentioning the recovery of the four eastern provinces, this is because Mr. Feng's strength can only reach this step. Liu Guitang's defection, I only heard that he expressed his intention to defect. I do not know whether he has defected now or the details of his defection.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks for Increased Import Tax on Rubber Products <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Maintaining Sales of Domestic Products Depends on Tax Protection</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to increase the import tax on rubber products to maintain domestic production. The petition states: This petition is for the matter of a request. It was found that the Chamber convened the fourth session of the members' representatives congress on the 25th of this month. The Shanghai Rubber Products Industry Association submitted a proposal to increase the import tax rate on rubber tires and shoes, stating: (1) Tires are a powerful tool to assist transportation. In the past, when our country's factories could not manufacture them, they all relied on imports from foreign merchants, and money flowed out incalculably. Since Chinese people set up factories to manufacture them themselves, although it has only been a little over a year, the progress of the products is beyond expectation. However, in view of the continuous import of foreign tires, rushing ahead and dumping them at low prices, domestic tires have suffered a major blow. If this continues, the future of domestic products is unimaginable. The fundamental policy of rescuing people's livelihoods is due to the fact that our country has not levied anti-dumping duties on foreign tires, nor has it increased import taxes. (2) Shoes, such as galoshes, sunny and rainy shoes, running shoes, and sneakers, are all daily necessities for people. However, the situation is the same as the plight of the above-mentioned tires. The only slight difference is that the import tax on shoes has been slightly increased this time. However, foreign shoes are indeed considered superior. In order to promote domestic products and guide the nascent industry of Chinese people, the import tax on shoes seems insufficient to achieve protective effects. There is indeed a possibility of foreign goods being dumped at low prices. However, no less than tens of thousands of people depend on rubber shoe factories for a living. If the import tax is not stable for one day, then tens of thousands of workers will be uneasy for one day, which is related to social and people's livelihood order, which is not a trivial matter. At the same time, the Rubber Hardware and Vehicle Materials Industry Association also submitted a proposal, stating that since the September 18th Incident, companies such as Xie Kang Rubber Shop have been manufacturing inner and outer tires for rickshaws and bicycles for one year, which are quite popular with Chinese people. However, due to foreign goods being dumped at low prices, the sales of domestic tires have been hindered. Please forward a request to levy the highest tax rate on imported foreign goods, etc. It was found that rubber products factories in this city have been established one after another in recent years, and it was a time of great prosperity. First, due to foreign dumping, most of these factories have closed down due to sluggish sales. Those with larger scale are also struggling to maintain. All of this has been repeatedly described in newspapers. The requests of the two associations to increase the import tax on foreign tires and to increase the tax on shoes more than the current tariff are for the sake of maintaining the nascent industry. After being submitted to the general meeting for a vote, it was decided to pass the proposal and submit it to the Ministry for review and implementation, which is a public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval for implementation, which is a public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds to the United Business Association Letter Regarding the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously received a letter from the Henan Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce to inquire about the Chinese Art Exhibition to be held in Berlin. After forwarding the telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate, the Association received a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. The full text of the letter is as follows: Greetings. Your telegram dated the 18th of this month, Min Zi No. 31, regarding the Chinese Art Exhibition to be held in Berlin this year, requesting clarification and reply, has been received. It was found that in June of the 20th year of the Republic, Liang, the former acting chargé d'affaires of the Embassy in Germany, reported that German scholars and teachers studying Oriental art had consulted with Liu Haisu, the principal of the Shanghai Art School, and decided to hold a Chinese Art Exhibition in Berlin. A preparatory committee was jointly organized by Chinese and German people. The German preparatory committee members have been appointed. All the expenses of the exhibition venue in the future are requested to be allocated and subsidized. After being forwarded to the Ministry of Education for review, no reply has been received. Recently, according to a letter from the Chinese preparatory office of the exhibition, the association plans to hold it in Berlin in 1934, and the request to allocate and subsidize it has been approved by the Executive Yuan upon presentation by the Ministry of Education. The Minister of Education, the President of the Central Research Institute, the President of the Beiping Research Institute, the Minister to Germany, and Chen Shuren, Ye Gongchuo, Liu Haisu, Gao Jianfu, and Xu Beihong were appointed as preparatory committee members. The first meeting of the preparatory committee was held in Shanghai on August 6 last year, with Cai Yuanpei as the chairman. The meeting place was located at the International Exchange Office of Publications of the Central Research Institute, No. 331 Albert Road, Shanghai. In view of the above, a corresponding letter is hereby replied for your information.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Arsenal's machinery was transferred to the capital and Hanyang in batches, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent a small number of staff to the factory to guard the un-transferred machinery and real estate. Now, the Ministry has ordered it to be closed by the end of this month. Therefore, all the un-transferred machinery in the factory has been assembled and is waiting for the Ministry's instructions. However, there is still a lot of un-transferred machinery in the factory, together with the real estate, worth about five to six million yuan, and personnel are needed to take over. Therefore, only the personnel currently remaining in the factory can be reduced by the end of this month. As for the loan owed by the factory to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, it will be handled by the Ministry of Military Affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Large Quantities of Chinese Silver Ingots Shipped to the United States <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>=Over Eleven Million Shipped in Sixty Days, Four Million More Exported Yesterday and the Day Before, Foreign Merchants Competing to Buy from the Yangtze River and North China=</p>
<p>Recently, the United States has needed silver and has been buying from our country for several months in large quantities. Foreign merchant banks in Shanghai have reported for export no less than twenty batches, and silver ingots are the main export, followed by broken silver and silver bars. Silver dollars account for only a small amount. Yesterday and the day before, a huge amount of silver was shipped to the United States. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Silver Ingots Already Loaded <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The shipment of Chinese silver to the United States started on March 18 this year. In the past, only American silver bars were imported and exchanged for gold coins for export. However, the situation changed in mid-March this year. The United States lacked silver and started buying from our country. From March 18 to May 26, this period of over two months, a total of twenty batches of silver ingots were loaded from Shanghai to the United States, with varying amounts. The total estimated value is 11,385,587.87 yuan in national currency. These silver ingots were mostly collected from the interior, loaded in boxes of 3,000 to 4,500 yuan each, and unloaded in New York.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Shipping Vessels <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The above silver ingots were shipped to the United States by various British and American banks in this port. The Dollar Steamship Line ships carried the most, accounting for about two-thirds. The rest were carried by Changxing, Tianxiang, Osaka, and the Meichuanshi Max Wheel. The freight alone costs about 100 yuan for each box of silver ingots from Shanghai to the United States. The total amount shipped out in June has not yet been calculated and announced.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Exports of the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday and the day before, another 466 boxes of silver ingots were reported by the American Bank of China and shipped to New York on the Taishan Wheel of the Tianxiang Line. The estimated value is 2,098,894.39 yuan, which was exported from Shanghai on the 24th. The next day, the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Line sailed to the United States. Another 400 boxes of silver ingots and silver bars worth an estimated 2 million yuan were also loaded to New York. There was another batch recently loaded for shipment.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Foreign Merchants' Purchases <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Recently, foreign merchants in Shanghai have flocked to various ports along the Yangtze River and inland areas of North China to collect old silver ingots from the people, gather them, and ship them to the United States. Because these silver ingots are of high quality and standard purity, shipping them to the United States can yield a profit of 7% or 8% after deducting various expenses. Therefore, many silver ingots have been shipped from Hankou, Yantai, and other places, with each batch arriving at the port with 400,000 to 500,000 taels. Once over one million are collected, they are reported for export.</p>

<p>=Announcing Seven Measures and Rewarding Reports from All Walks of Life=</p>
<p>Shanghai Huashang Electric Company, Zhabei Hydropower Company, Pudong Electric Company, Yihua Electric Company, and Zhenru Electric Company, and other six private electrical companies, have recently seen a surge in electricity theft cases. The companies have suffered considerable losses. In order to prevent imitation and reward citizens for reporting, the above five electrical companies, on the 20th of this month, each sent representatives to convene a meeting at the Huashang Electric Company to discuss countermeasures. Based on Article 14 of the "Regulations on Handling Electricity Theft by Electrical Operators" promulgated by the Construction Committee, seven measures for inspecting electricity theft and rewarding reporting were drafted and approved by the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for record, and it was decided to implement them starting from the first of next month. The relevant clauses are extracted as follows: (Article 1) All private electrical companies in Shanghai (hereinafter referred to as "electrical companies") shall, in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the "Regulations on Handling Electricity Theft by Electrical Operators" promulgated by the Construction Committee, jointly formulate these measures. All rewards related to inspecting electricity theft and reporting electricity theft shall be carried out in accordance with these measures.

<p>丨Missing for Over Ten Days, No News Yet丨</p>
<p>Chen Xiaohong, a fourth-grade student at the Rotary Elementary School run by the Shanghai-Ningbo-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines in this port, is 18 years old and has a resolute nature. He often told his classmates that he would kill a few Japanese devils one day to show them. However, those who heard it would laugh it off. Unexpectedly, Chen suddenly ran away from the school on the afternoon of the 14th of this month. Before leaving, he said to the doorman, "I am enlisting in the army to resist Japan." It has been more than ten days now, and there is no news from inquiries everywhere. It is said that there is an old father in the family who cries all day long, and the situation is extremely miserable.</p>

<p>=The Coffin Decayed and Leaked, the Ancient Corpse Was Not Decomposed, There Was Liquid Inside, Superstitious Women and Children Scrambling to Scrape It, Saying It Can Cure Diseases=</p>
<p>丨The Public Security Bureau Pays Attention to Hygiene and Sends Police to Prohibit It丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, an ancient tomb was excavated at Wanzhu Street inside Xiaobeimen. The female corpse was intact and caused a sensation. Yesterday's newspaper also carried various legends. The reporter went to the site for investigation at Shenshi and confirmed that a female coffin was dug out on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Because the coffin was old and the bottom fell out, the female corpse leaked out. It was indeed not decomposed, but it turned black after being exposed to the air for a while. It has now been reburied in another coffin. The broken coffin left behind has accumulated a thick, yellow-black liquid. At that time, superstitious people spread rumors that this ointment could cure diseases if taken. Therefore, a group of ignorant women and children scrambled to scrape it. The first branch of the second district of the Public Security Bureau, in view of the fact that this liquid was transformed from a corrupt corpse buried underground in the coffin for a long time, and it must contain toxic substances, fearing that the ignorant people would actually take it, would inevitably get sick without being sick, which would be detrimental to public health, has ordered the patrol leader Zhang to take the police to the site to suppress it and explain it to the audience to avoid being harmed by superstition. As for the black water, goldfish, etc. reported, they are completely inaccurate.</p>

<p>Negotiations Stalled, Request to the Ministry to Extend the Deadline</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the merger issue of the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange started more than three years ago. At that time, it was extended due to various difficulties. However, it expired on May 31 of this year. Therefore, the securities section will be merged from June 1, but the gold section has been negotiated many times without any result. The opinions of the authorities of the two exchanges have also been difficult to reconcile, so much so that it has stalled today.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Artist Zhang Chongren's Honors in Belgium <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>丨Won Six Awards丨</p>
<p>After arriving in Europe, the Shanghai young artist Zhang Chongren entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Belgium to study Western art with relentless effort. Even on holidays, he either lingered in famous museums or sketched in the wild, striving to bear beautiful fruit. In this year's art competition, he won six awards: first place in oil painting landscape, first place in animal anatomy, first place in perspective, second place in oil painting composition (figure), second place in human anatomy, and second place in modern pattern. The Palais des Academifs of the University of Belgium announced the results of the competition the other day. The mayor of Beijing, Max, presided over the meeting. Among those present were the Belgian Minister of Education, Banweds, the Governor of Brabant Province, Nens, the great sculptor Victor Rousseau, the great painter Bastien, and more than 500 other artists and guests. Conrardy reported the names and origins of the first and second place winners in each competition. When the participants heard their names announced, they had to go on stage to greet the chairman and guests. They congratulated each other. Mr. Zhang won first place three times and second place three times. Amid the applause of more than 500 people, he went on stage six times to shake hands with the president, the governor, the mayor, and others to congratulate him. As a young man from the Far East, he can compete with European artists in Western art, which has attracted the attention of the art world and won glory for the country. The Minister of Education said, "Oriental artists come to Europe to study language, and they have already suffered a loss. Now, in addition to practical art, they can also compete in aesthetic theory, which is unprecedented in my opinion." The next morning, major Belgian newspapers published it as news. Foreigners did not distinguish between Chinese surnames in detail, and for a time, Chinese artists became a topic of conversation.</p>

<p>Yang Wu's False Accusation Leads to Disaster</p>
<p>Qiu Wang Dies by the Knife</p>
<p>Wang Longguang, a native of Jiangxi, is 53 years old. He lives upstairs in the hall at No. 94 Yifu Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei Baoshan Road. His wife, Qiu Wang, is 40 years old. Since their marriage, the couple's relationship has been quite harmonious. Recently, Wang suddenly became entangled with Wu Yang, a woman from the same hometown living in the pavilion room at No. 94. Their clandestine affair has been going on for quite some time. Wu Yihe, Wu Yang's husband, is an unemployed resident. Although he vaguely heard about his wife's improper behavior, he couldn't find any evidence, so he kept it to himself. However, recently, Wang's wife, Qiu Wang, found out about the affair and secretly observed her husband's actions. She discovered that there was indeed a mutual affection between the two. Qiu Wang became extremely jealous and repeatedly tried to create trouble to vent her anger. However, she couldn't find any excuse to start a fight. A few days ago, the weather was hot, and Wu Yang borrowed a bathing basin from Qiu Wang because she didn't have one at home. Inadvertently, she dropped the basin, breaking it. Qiu Wang used this as an excuse to confront Wu Yang, which immediately led to a quarrel. People nearby intervened and stopped them from fighting. However, Qiu Wang was still angry and dissatisfied. Yesterday, at around 5:50 PM, she went to Wu Yang's place again to demand compensation for the basin. Wu Yang completely ignored her, and the two women went from exchanging insults to fighting. Qiu Wang, unable to contain her anger, ran back to her room, grabbed a small knife, and stabbed Wu Yang in the face. However, in a twist, Wu Yang snatched the knife from Qiu Wang and stabbed her in the abdomen. Qiu Wang was unable to dodge and was stabbed in the abdomen, immediately bleeding profusely. She collapsed to the ground and died. Neighbors heard the commotion and immediately reported it to the Second Precinct of the Fifth District. The precinct dispatched police officers to the scene and learned about what had happened. They arrested Wang Longguang, Wu Yang, and Wu Yihe and took them to the precinct for questioning and further action. Qiu Wang's body was guarded by the local Baojia, awaiting forensic examination by the court this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Core of the Problem <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The core issue that makes this merger difficult to succeed lies in the placement of personnel. The Gold Exchange proposes the merger with the Commodities Exchange as a condition. However, it is difficult to accommodate all the personnel from the commodities side, and in fact, it is almost impossible. The Commodities Exchange insists that all its employees must be accommodated. If there aren't enough positions, they suggest forming a second gold market. However, the Gold Exchange is reluctant to accept this proposal, creating a deadlock in negotiations.</p>

<p>As negotiations between the two exchanges have reached a stalemate, they have reported the situation to the Ministry of Industry and requested a postponement to allow for further negotiations. Both exchanges understand that national laws and regulations must be followed, but the negotiation issues should also be resolved satisfactorily. However, the Ministry has not yet responded to this request. In the meantime, both exchanges continue to operate as usual, maintaining the status quo.</p>

<p>The Wuhan Red Swastika Society sent a telegram to the Shanghai General Office stating that the disaster in Shaanxi is extremely severe. The head office and your office have sent personnel to handle emergency relief and to take in children in Shaanxi. However, with the heat of summer, the disaster is worsening. The number of deaths is countless, and there are orphaned girls everywhere. Charitable organizations in the province are struggling with insufficient funds and are unable to take in as many as they can. The emergency relief provided by charitable organizations is like a drop in the bucket. The cries of young children under the scorching sun are unbearable to hear. Our society has formed a team to go to Shaanxi to take in disaster-stricken children and send them to Wuhan for care. The team leader, Zhou Han Yun, has already departed on [date]. We are sending this telegram to inform you. Wuhan Red Swastika Society Office.</p>

<p>From Jing'an Temple to the Southern End of the Bund</p>
<p>The public bus company has petitioned the Municipal Council to add an eighth new route, running from in front of the Qiaoqi Hotel in Jing'an Temple, via Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road, to the southern end of the Bund. A bus will run every eight minutes, with the same fares as Route 1. Special arrangements will be made at the southern end of the Bund for parking and turning to avoid traffic congestion. The Municipal Council has tentatively approved the trial implementation of this plan.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Increased Postage for Nanyang <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>12.5 Cents Per Item</p>
<p>Effective September 1st</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The Ministry of Transportation has approved the Postal Administration's request to increase postage for Nanyang, effective September 1st. According to Bureau Chief Huang Naishu, the postage for Nanyang mail is 10 cents per item, the same as for other overseas mail. However, to provide preferential treatment to overseas Chinese, there was a reduced rate of half price. As the postage for overseas mail has increased to 25 cents, the postage for Nanyang has not been increased at all. Now, due to the significant postal deficit, it is proposed to increase it to 12.5 cents. Although the increase is double, it only affects Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other places, and the increase is only half of the 25 cents. After this proposal was made, many overseas Chinese opposed it. The Postal Administration also took into consideration the hardships of the people and repeatedly pleaded for understanding. Fortunately, understanding was reached, and the increase will be implemented in September. This will increase the Postal Administration's revenue by over 100,000 yuan per year.</p>

<p>Party and Government Agencies Failed to Mediate Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Feixing Rickshaw Company on Baoshan Road, Zhabei, employs a total of 159 workers. Recently, manager Gu Songmao informed the workers that the shareholders were planning to dissolve the company and wanted to downsize. On the 20th, the lamp repair department was closed, and the workers in that department would be dismissed next month. At the same time, it was proposed to reduce the number of workers in the shop department, hiring only 70% of the carpenters, blacksmiths, ironworkers, tailors, and painters. This has sparked opposition from all the workers. According to the workers, they were hired by the former manager, a Westerner named Guoren. Since Gu took over in the 16th year, it seems he is just using the Feixing brand, and it is unknown whether the Westerner actually sold the company to Gu. Logically speaking, Gu has no right to make changes. However, the management stated that they acquired the company from the Westerner in the 16th year for a fixed term of five and a half years, which has now expired, and the foreign company should continue to operate the company. The workers had no choice but to petition party and government agencies for mediation. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, party and government agencies summoned representatives from both labor and management to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. The labor representatives were Jing Shengyu and Xu Fuji, and the management representatives were Gu Songmao and Bao Bing. Dai Yongchan of the Municipal Party Headquarters and Zhu Jintao of the Social Affairs Bureau chaired the meeting. In the end, the management refused to reinstate the workers in the closed department and insisted on maintaining the status quo, resulting in failed mediation. The party and government representatives then ordered both parties to leave and try to reach an agreement on their own. If no agreement is reached, another mediation session will be scheduled.</p>

<p>Branch of the City Federation Sends Letter Requesting Negotiations</p>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Association of the French Concession of this port and the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens Federation sent a letter to the General Association yesterday regarding the French Municipal Council's collection of awning tax, requesting negotiations to stop it. The original letter is transcribed below: "To whom it may concern, we have received complaints from member businesses such as the Dayouxing Wine Store and Deyuan Restaurant in the Bailuer Road area, stating that due to the recent hot weather, they have put up cloth awnings in front of their stores to provide shade. However, they have been repeatedly notified by the police to pay taxes and have been arbitrarily fined. Our awnings are not suspended in the air, but only hung from the front of the building and are very high off the ground. We cannot accept this unreasonable and harsh tax. We request that your association negotiate and stop this tax, and prevent the police from issuing fines." "Shops hang cloth awnings to block the sun, which not only does not obstruct traffic but also benefits pedestrians. Moreover, the awnings are only hung for three months. To levy a large amount of taxes in such a short period of time is truly a harsh tax that disturbs the people. Your association has repeatedly negotiated with the French authorities, and the authorities have agreed to submit the matter to the Board of Directors for discussion. However, according to reports from various shops, the collection of taxes continues as before, and the police are using intimidation and punishment, which is completely unreasonable and disruptive. We are writing to request that your association promptly negotiate with the French authorities and stop the imposition of penalties until the matter is resolved, so as to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. We await your urgent instructions."</p>

<p>Employees in the used clothing industry were outraged that employers were still making them shout while eating, leaving them no time to rest after a full meal, which was detrimental to their health. Considering the national crisis, they prudently submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union to uphold the existing conditions, instructing the Used Clothing Industry Association to relay to all employers to comply with the original conditions to prevent unexpected disputes. On the other hand, they will implement a complete cessation of shouting while eating starting July 1 to emphasize humanitarianism.</p>

<p>Rations Issued by Name</p>
<p>Plans to Send Them Back to Their Hometown Soon</p>
<p>Due to natural disasters and man-made calamities in various areas of Ruijin County, Jiangxi, the people have no clothes or food and cannot live in peace. Three years ago, gentry members Liu Shengpeng and Yang Shiying, along with Yang Rongliu and other members of the Public Security Bureau and the Local Autonomy Preparatory Office, led over 700 refugees, begging along the way, and fleeing to Guangdong. After receiving passports issued by the county head of Jiaoling County, Guangdong Province, 130 people arrived in Shanghai on the Zhaoshangju's Fair Wheel. Another 491 people arrived in Shanghai on the Taikoo Company's Xinjiang Wheel, totaling over 600 people. They arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and disembarked at the Zhaoshangju New Pier in Nanshi. Afterwards, Sun Yulin, a patrol officer from the First Precinct of the Pudong Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Wu Zuojing, a policeman from the First Division of the First District, went to maintain order and temporarily housed them in the Jiangxi Guild Hall at Xiaoputuo Bridge outside Xiaonanmen. Yesterday morning, representatives of the refugees went to the Social Affairs Bureau to register and to the Public Security Bureau to request relief. Hong Qiwen, the chief of the Second Section, sent Yin Guanzhi, the director of the relief division, to issue rations by name. Plans are being made to send them to Nanchang, Jiangxi, for further processing.</p>

<p>|Implementation Upon Approval by the Ministry|</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has recently found that the export of poultry feathers from China is significant. However, ordinary merchants are unaware of the customs inspection standards of various countries. Sometimes, exports are rejected for not meeting hygiene standards and are forced to return, resulting in significant losses. Recognizing this, the bureau is now inspecting exported feathers according to the Commodity Inspection Regulations. A report has been submitted to the Ministry, and once approved, merchants will be notified to send all exported feathers to the bureau for inspection before export. If the feathers are deemed qualified, it can be guaranteed that they will be allowed to be imported into any foreign country, avoiding unnecessary trips and hardship for merchants.</p>

The entire third floor of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall will be used as the exhibition venue. Preparations are actively underway, and the opening is scheduled for July 9th. We sincerely hope that all factories in the silk and satin industry, both locally and abroad, will quickly prepare new and innovative exhibits and submit them to the Chinese National Silk and Satin Exhibition Exhibit Collection Office located within the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce before July 6th, so that we can arrange the displays and open on schedule for public viewing, allowing the public to recognize the value of domestic brocade and the agricultural and silkworm industries can be revitalized.

<p>This year, the Chinese Jisheng Society in this port has spent funds on emergency relief and seed distribution in Wugong, Shaanxi. Mr. Wang, a philanthropist, is deeply concerned about the frequent droughts in the counties of Shaanxi, especially the severe disaster in Wugong, which has left the people in dire straits. The dry fields lack ponds and weirs, and the crops cannot be irrigated, making it difficult to predict the harvest. In light of this, Mr. Wang donated 1,000 yuan to the society to test the drilling of five wells in the rural areas of the county. The Society has sent letters to the Chang'an Branch and the gentry of Wugong County, requesting them to send personnel to investigate suitable locations, assess the depth and width of the wells, and create designs for the construction of the millstone well railings, and to send diagrams and explanations to the Society for review and approval before construction commences. This will enable water conservation and benefit agricultural land. If any philanthropist can continue to provide funds for drilling, it would be a great act of merit to promote water conservation and universally help all living beings.</p>

<p>The China Harmonica Society held its second anniversary concert at the Yingshi Memorial Hall of the Lake Society on the evenings of the 23rd and 24th of this month. Around 1,500 people attended. Directors and advisors of the society, such as Gu Yu, Pan Yangyao, Huang Jinwu, Yang Linzhi, Xing Dingcheng, Xu Weigong, Huang Jingwan, and others, as well as reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers, and people from Britain and Germany, numbered no less than 100. Each evening, the concert began at 8:00 PM. Society President and Director Wang Qingxun gave an opening speech. The music then began. In the first section, the society's harmonica team, consisting of over 50 men and women, performed a large ensemble of the Party Song and the overture to "Heaven and Hell." This was followed by a performance of "Elegy in Memory of Fallen Soldiers" and "Black Horse Galloping," which were highly praised. The song "Nineteenth Route Army March," composed by Wang himself, was particularly well-received. The song was passionate and inspiring, symbolizing the Nineteenth Route Army soldiers charging into battle. The audience was deeply moved. Mr. Yang, the director of the recording department of the Shanghai Victory Company, felt that Wang's song was tragic and passionate and would inspire the patriotism of the people, and has specially invited the society's harmonica team to record the harmonica song for the company. In the second section, Kunqu opera "Amitabha Buddha," famous opera "La Traviata," "Carmen," and "Invitation to the Dancing Party" were performed. The "Amitabha Buddha" was performed with wooden fish and chanting, which was quite interesting. When listening with eyes closed, it was as if one were in the temple. "La Traviata" and "Carmen" are Spanish-style dance tunes, which are melodious. It was as if one were listening to the high mountain flowing water, which made all the one thousand people feel great. "Invitation to the Dancing Party" had a melodious sound, and the tone was excellent, causing people to want to dance. Guests who participated in the performance included Wei Zhongle from the Datong Music Society with his Pipa song "Huaiyin Pingchu" and Guqin, Li Kainan with his Hawaiian marching song on his guitar, the Wu Ping Music Troupe from Wu County with their Chinese music "Lianhuan Kou," and Jiang Shouliang with his Banhu "Chu Huan Xiao Chang."

<p>Circuses have always been dominated by foreigners, and Chinese people have never been involved. Now, a large-scale Chinese martial arts circus, composed of Chinese martial arts experts, both male and female, has been performing amazing stunts in major ports in England, France, Holland, Siam, India, and other places for four years, leaving audiences in awe.

The Siamese Emperor awarded them generously and gave them a reward of 800 baht. In Burma, during the performance of the "Double Suspension" act, the Burmese Governor's Office requested a repeat performance. This shows how well-received they are everywhere. Many fine horses, elephants, tigers, lions, leopards, and other animals have been collected from abroad for performances and are well-trained to perform in sequence. There are also various clever stunts, such as "Girl Riding a Horse" and "Elephant Stepping on People." The variety is endless. Now, in response to invitations from all walks of life, they have returned to China. They will make a short stop in Hong Kong and will arrive in Shanghai soon.

<p>Sun Xingsheng and 22 other defendants in the Xin Renhe ship massacre case have been sentenced. Chen Baosheng, the absconding deputy comprador in the verdict, came to Shanghai to visit his sick wife and children and was captured by the detectives of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He has been transferred to the local court. After a preliminary hearing by Prosecutor Zhang, he was ordered to be detained. Since the case had already been prosecuted, and Chen Baosheng was a fugitive at the time, he was prosecuted in absentia. The Prosecutor's Office sent Chen for trial. Yesterday, Judge Luo opened an investigation court to interrogate Chen Baosheng, who claimed that he was already asleep when the killings occurred and knew nothing about them. Later, Wang Guanxian forced him to sign the document, threatening him with the same treatment if he refused. The judge instructed him that since the case was an investigation, he could appoint a defense lawyer himself, and then the court would reconvene for a debate, and ordered him to be taken back into custody.</p>

<p>=Received a warning letter from the Anti-Treason Group, embezzled opium, and committed suicide=</p>
<p>Minhua Sen Umbrella Factory, located at No. 661, Jiucang Street intersection, Laobeimen, Minguo Road, was opened by Lu Tongcheng (38 years old) from Jingjiang. Its business was quite prosperous. However, due to the nature of his business, he inevitably purchased enemy goods and raw materials. Therefore, he received a letter previously, which was identified as a warning letter from the Anti-Treason Group. Lu was greatly surprised. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 26th of this month, he received another letter from the Anti-Treason Group, which depicted a bomb, a pistol, and a dagger. The language inside was extremely intense. After reading the letter, Lu immediately turned pale and looked worried. He was restless inside the house, either walking slowly or sitting silently with his head propped up, his brow furrowed with deep concern. When he went out alone in the evening, he returned home at 9 o'clock, lying down on the bed. His family was not yet aware of his situation. Around 10 o'clock, Lu, lying in bed, made a terrible moaning sound. His family went to inquire, and he shook his head in tears, unable to speak. Realizing that he had taken poison, his younger brother, Lu Tongyuan, immediately took him to Renji Hospital for treatment. He was diagnosed with opium poisoning, but because he had ingested a large amount and the time had passed, he could not be saved. He lingered until 6 o'clock yesterday morning when he finally succumbed. His brother then reported the information to the trade association and the First Precinct of the Second District, requesting an investigation. That precinct then ordered Jiang Pingyang, the Jiupu landlord, to report to the District Court for verification in the afternoon. Subsequently, the prosecutor and others arrived at the court and confirmed the cause of death. The brother was instructed to collect the body for burial after proper verification.</p>

<p>=Mother Received News and Tracked Her to Shanghai, Reported to the Police, and Escaped from the Pit of Fire=</p>
<p>Dong Yan, a woman from Hangzhou, made a living washing clothes. She had a daughter named Jin Feng, who was 18 years old and possessed captivating beauty. Because of poverty, she worked as a female worker at the Fangzheng Tea Shop in Hangzhou. Dai Ronglin, a pockmarked man, knew the Dong family. Seeing Jin Feng's beauty, he harbored bad intentions. On the 21st day of the second lunar month of this year, he went to the Fangzheng Tea Shop and deceptively told Jin Feng that there were many factories in Shanghai and that the wages were quite high. He claimed that he had recommended her to work in a silk stocking factory and ordered her to go to Shanghai with him. If she refused, he threatened that something dangerous might happen. Jin Feng was young and lacked knowledge, and she was deceived and intimidated by Dai's tricks. She went to Shanghai with him and stayed at Dai's house at No. 80, Pu Road. Dai then negotiated with a client. When the time came, Dai claimed that he was taking the girl to the hotel to take a bath and led Jin Feng to the hotel where she had sexual relations with the client. Dai received 100 yuan for this. After that, Dai sold Jin Feng to the Geisha house opened by He Faguei from Nanjing at No. 56, Jing'an Lane, Longmen Road, for 30 yuan. From then on, she was trapped in the pit of fire, living a life of prostitution. Every evening, when the sun set and the lights came on, He sent a maid to accompany Jin Feng to various amusement parks to solicit customers (commonly known as "tangbai") and exchanged her body for money, living the life of a goddess. The night income was split between He and Jin Feng. Jin Feng found this life very painful, and worried about her old mother, who was in great distress after her disappearance. She told He Faguei about being deceived by Dai and asked to send a letter to her mother to prepare the money for her redemption. He agreed and sent a letter to Dong Yan in Hangzhou last month. After receiving the letter, she finally learned the location of her daughter and borrowed travel expenses from relatives the other day to take a train to Shanghai, going directly to He's place on Longmen Road. However, He demanded 50 yuan before he would release her daughter. Because she was destitute and had no money, she had no choice but to report to the Xinzha police station. Detective Zhao Qingkui, bao detective Xu Huanqing, and west detective Qijiagsheng were dispatched to bring He Faguei and Dong Jin Feng to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the above situation. He was now prosecuted under Article 258, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. Judge Qian Wenji questioned Dong Yan, Dong Jin Feng, and the defendant He Faguei, and immediately sentenced He to six months in prison with a two-year reprieve for the crime of inducing others to profit. Jin Feng was taken back by her mother, Dong Yan, after making a written guarantee.</p>

<p>Letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to Pay Attention</p>
<p>Xiang Liansun, the owner of Hechang Pengxing, located at No. 1099, Peng Road, Broadway, Hongkou, hired bodyguards to accompany him in and out due to the bad social environment. The other day, he went to Minhang on business and hired a car from the Huabei Automobile Company. He went in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, at 2:30 pm, when the car reached the left side of Xujiahui (i.e. Tushanwan), near Zhongshan Road, he saw two men in short clothes in front. As soon as they saw the car, they ran forward quickly. At the corner of the road, the two men stopped, one raised his hand as a signal, and at the same time a man in a suit jumped out from the left, raised his hand and ordered the car to stop. The three men each took out a pistol to threaten him, intending to kidnap him. However, Xiang also had his own pistol and ordered his bodyguards to take out their pistols, aim, and defend themselves. At the same time, he urged the driver to drive quickly, so he was able to escape. It was said that they were bandits or robbers, but they did not succeed. It was said that they were plainclothes detectives investigating criminals, but they did not identify themselves. Judging from their actions, they were definitely not good people, either kidnapping or robbing. At that time, the crisis was imminent. Afterwards, Xiang, considering that the place was the Shanghai-Minhang thoroughfare and there were many Chinese and foreign people coming and going, for the sake of public security, specially sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting that the district office be ordered to strictly arrest bandits and take proper precautions.</p>

At the same time, he prepared a document to submit to the judicial section for review.</p>

<p>Pushan Villa handles the burial of exposed corpses in Shanghai, respecting humanity and emphasizing hygiene. It also provides medical treatment and medicine to relieve the poor and sick, truly seeking happiness for the local people. Since 1928, in accordance with the wishes of Mr. Wang Yiting, the idea was that coffins are not buried in Jiangzhe hinterland, forming a bad habit, the bones are piling up, which is unbearable to see. Therefore, he was entrusted with the task of burying the coffins in the hinterland of Jiangzhe. To date, a total of 71,261 exposed coffins and bones have been collected. The next round of handling will face funding difficulties, and it is feared that it will be suspended. In addition, the river channels in Suzhou City are extremely polluted, and dead animals are often thrown into the river, affecting drinking water hygiene. The dredging work started last year, and as of May of this year, a total of 1,024 dead animals such as cats and dogs and 97 and a half boats of garbage were dredged, all of which were transported to Hengshanbang for burial. In addition, 35 dried public wells were repaired, all of which were used for drinking water by residents, and some repairs were made. Such practical charitable activities and public health have a great relationship. They are all carefully planned by Mr. Wang Junsheng, the director of the villa, and the residents have benefited a lot. However, the villa has no specific funds for charitable activities and relies entirely on donations from all walks of life to maintain it. At this time, it is not easy to raise donations, and regular expenses cannot be reduced. We have to ask for help to increase contributions. We urge kind people from all walks of life to donate generously and participate in charitable activities, so that the villa can continue its various charitable activities. The merits are immeasurable. It is also heard that the comrades of the Leshan Society are enthusiastically supporting the villa and will also hold a theatrical performance to raise funds. It is believed that benefactors from all walks of life will definitely enthusiastically help at that time.</p>

<p>▲Yongsheng Sells Sanitary Rice Yongsheng Rice Shop was established on the Nanhao Road, Laozhagang more than 40 years ago. Its goods have always been genuine and the price has been fair. Recently, with decades of experience, they have found that the season will inevitably be rainy and everything will ferment. Therefore, the human body is also prone to fatigue at this time, due to poor rice quality. In recent years, most of the rice shops in Shanghai have been selling white rice, but there are few sanitary rice on sale. It is not known that machine-milled white rice, although beautiful and palatable, has lost its natural nourishing properties (i.e. vitamins), while the nourishing sanitary rice is not promoted. The shop has come up with a unique idea and set up a factory in the interior, hiring workers to manually clean the white rice and transport it to Shanghai for low-cost sale. Because the rice is truly manually cleaned, the rice quality is exquisite and has a unique fragrance. Eating it can strengthen the spleen and stomach and prevent beriberi.</p>

<p>▲The YMCA Injects Immunization Vaccines The Shanghai YMCA on Sichuan Road holds various health campaigns every summer. The weather has been hot recently, and epidemics are inevitable. Therefore, it has contacted the Municipal Health Bureau and decided to provide free immunization injections at the Sichuan Road YMCA Gymnasium from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm today. The Baxianqiao Trade Union Hall will also hold injections from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm on the same afternoon. Anyone who wants to get the injections, whether members or non-members, can go without restrictions. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will pay attention. Cowpox will also be planted on this day, and the second time is scheduled for July 5.</p>
<p>▲The Third Branch of the Second Special District City Federation Provides Medical Treatment The Shanghai Second Special District City Federation's Third District Branch held its thirteenth executive committee meeting at No. 434, Pubo Road. More than ten committee members including Wang Shunfa attended. Wang Shunfa chaired the meeting. After reporting on the various situations, it was proposed that the season has reached summer and all the clinics set up by the association should be expanded to adapt to the needs of the environment. It was decided to increase funding, hire more doctors, and stipulate that in addition to the daily consultation time, preventive medicines should be distributed to the community to enhance the defense against seasonal epidemics, which is truly good news for the summer.</p>
<p>▲Achievements of National Doctor Zhang Minzhi National Doctor Zhang Minzhi is the nephew of Zhang Dongliang, a famous doctor from Xindu. He first studied surgery and then devoted himself to internal medicine. After completing his studies, he followed his uncle's path. His experience and knowledge are both highly regarded. In the spring of 1925, he hung his sign at the clinic in Yanzhaoli, Shanhaiguan Road, Baike Road. Tao Jiequan, the secretary of the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office, suffered from chronic stomach problems for many years and had been treated by Chinese and Western doctors to little avail. A friend introduced him to Dr. Zhang for diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Zhang had a unique opinion, that the disease was in the liver and stomach meridians. After only a few doses of medicine, the disease was miraculously cured. This is because Dr. Zhang had a deep understanding of the inner workings of the disease and was able to achieve this.</p>

<p>丨 Letter from Zhou Huanzhong of Wucheng, Jiangxi 丨</p>
<p>I am a young man approaching the age of twenty, but I am still young and lack any sense of awareness. My family lives in a small village in Juxin County, Jiangxi. My grandfather and father were both charitable people, just farmers in the village. Because they were financially strapped and had no means of earning a living, they struggled to raise my uncle. When my uncle was sixteen, he was apprenticed to a silk thread shop in Xiushui. After completing his apprenticeship, he opened a small silk thread shop there, and I studied in Xiushui for a few years. The shop's business was quite good, with profits increasing slightly year by year, gradually accumulating. My uncle was also very frugal, and very trustworthy. He also opened a fabric and foreign goods shop, which was also quite successful. Unfortunately, in recent years, the market in that area has become increasingly depressed, and the area has been unstable, with frequent disturbances. We have been robbed seven or eight times, losing all our money and goods. Seeing this situation, my uncle knew that the situation was hopeless and that the end was near. He became ill with worry and eventually passed away. At that time, as a nephew, I was only thinking about survival, but neither was a good solution. During that time, I also studied at school for a few years. But the family was completely ruined. There was nothing for the old and young to do, and we had no cheerful relatives or friends. It was difficult for the eight of us to maintain our clothing and food, and I could not earn a single penny. Later, I was introduced by a relative, Deng Shaodun, to apprentice at the Huida Rice Shop in Wucheng. I was fortunate to have many teachers and friends who taught me earnestly, but I was inattentive and forgetful. Now, the shop's business has also ceased. My future livelihood is in great danger. In this situation, there is no joy in life, and there is great panic about the family's finances. Please, sir, give me the clearest possible direction. Answer: You are in Jiangxi, where the countryside is widely devastated, and it is difficult to maintain a livelihood. We are thousands of miles away. How can we give you a "clearest possible direction" out of thin air? This is really an impossible thing. Thank you for your letter from afar, asking so earnestly. We are sorry that we are unable to help! In the near future, this newspaper plans to select experts to go to Jiangxi and Hubei provinces to investigate the countryside. If this trip yields real materials, it may be of some help in the future for the reconstruction of your province and the provinces of Hunan and Anhui. This is also our way of repaying you.</p>

The motion on whether or not the Federation should take a vacation during the summer was passed in accordance with the decision of the eighth executive committee meeting to take a two-month vacation. If necessary, the documentation department will convene a meeting. The original text of the petition to the Ministry of Education is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e194">Petition to the Ministry of Education <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>To the honorable Ministry of Education of the Nanjing National Government, we have recently read in the newspapers that the Ministry has proposed to restrict the enrollment of arts and law students in all public and private universities and independent colleges in the next academic year. The standard is that the number of arts and law students enrolled in each national and private university shall not exceed the original number of science students in that university. The number of arts and law students enrolled in independent colleges shall also not exceed the original number of students in that college in the 20th year of the Republic. After reading this, we believe that the Ministry intends to promote science education by restricting the enrollment of arts and law faculties. However, after repeated meetings and deliberations by our association, we feel that there are many difficulties in this plan, and it will not be easy to achieve the desired effect. We dare to offer our views for your consideration. 1. Our country has a long history and profound culture. Academic thought is extremely vast, and the social environment is extremely complex. Is it appropriate to focus solely on science education today and disregard arts and law faculties? This is still a major issue that has not yet been resolved. Germany's material science, mechanical engineering, and civilization are the best in the world, but we have not heard that this came from suppressing arts and law faculties. Furthermore, we have not heard that this has led to biased scientific</p>
<h3 id="e195">Abnormal Development <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>While legal studies has formed the continental legal system, and philosophy is a major center of the world. Previous examples are available and not difficult to learn from. Therefore, our association believes that it is best for the Ministry to carefully consider and deliberate on this matter, consult widely, and obtain the unanimous opinion of the national education community before issuing a final decision on the highest education policy. This is the first point to consider. 2. In recent years, our country has suffered from internal unrest and economic decline. National funding and private donations for science are very small. Therefore, public and private universities in our country are mostly incomplete in their science departments, and independent science colleges are even rarer. This is limited by reality and cannot be denied. If we follow the Ministry's new plan in the future, the basic teaching materials, library equipment, and domestic arts and law experts and professors of the original arts and law faculties will all be abandoned and left idle. On the one hand, science education will not advance because of the restrictions on arts and law faculties. On the other hand, private universities or colleges will not be able to continue to grow their existing achievements, and the new regulations for the future are not just empty talk. They will inevitably have difficulty surviving. This does not seem to be the Ministry's original intention of promoting education in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. This is the second point to consider. 3. Private universities across the country differ in their economic</p>
<h3 id="e196">Different Environments <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Equipment has its pros and cons, and student enrollment varies. It is difficult to have uniform and predictable statistics on the number of students in a particular department in a particular school in a certain year. If we follow the Ministry's new order in the future, the schools with a particularly large number of students in the 20th year will still enjoy the great benefits of expanded enrollment, while the schools with a small number of students in the 20th year will suddenly suffer the strange disaster of permanent restrictions. There is nothing more unfair in principle and inconsistent in policies than this. This is the third point to consider. 4. Social undertakings in our country are underdeveloped, and the industrial foundation is extremely weak. This is because the people's living environment is difficult, the social economy is declining, and the government's promotion and protection of industry is misguided. Therefore, those who hold the country's power today and sincerely want to establish agricultural and industrial salvation policies, increase the efficiency of material science, should, on the one hand, widely provide national factories and reward private industries, and on the other hand, improve basic mechanical academics and popularize people's practical skills. The ratio statistics of industrial development and talent needs must be properly adjusted and planned. If we do not take this into account, and we see that today the nation's hundreds of industries are declining and industrial and commercial activities are failing, and large-scale factories and machine plants are as rare as morning stars, and the country is wasting national currency, and the graduates of industrial and commercial specialties at home and abroad who have already been trained still have no place to sell their talents and their studies are not used, and we do not consider the actual existence of places to receive them, but only seek to create a large number of high-achieving science students, it would be a waste of national financial resources and a waste of useful talent. Then, not only today's</p>
<h3 id="e197">Educational System <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Is already chaotic, but the social impact in the future will only increase disputes, and it will be a loss in one fell swoop, and I have not seen its benefit. Critics say that today there is an oversupply of arts and law students, and they all tend to go into politics, which encourages the pursuit of fame and increases the atmosphere of frivolity. They do not realize that this is due to the disequilibrium of the nation's policies and the imperfect organization of the political system, which fails to make the best use of people's talents. It cannot be attributed solely to the large number of arts and law graduates. Moreover, if we consider the proportion of arts and law students in our country compared to the proportions in civilized countries in Europe and America, it is actually still insufficient. Even if we concede that there is temporary congestion in our country among those who study arts and law, they can still make a living by writing books. If science and engineering graduates are left over and society has no place to use them, individuals will feel the difficulty of making a living. If we look at the number of people who study science and engineering and become officials, there will be no shortage of them. This is not only a criticism of using what is not learned, but it will also cause people to study without being useful. It does not seem to be the intention of the Ministry to</p>
<h3 id="e198">Weigh the Pros and Cons <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>To achieve a comprehensive reform. This is the fourth point to consider. 5. Furthermore, our association has something it cannot refrain from saying. Today's social trends are becoming increasingly radical, and young people's minds are easily agitated. If the nation takes this as a hidden worry, it is important to have a good strategy for welcoming talent. If we do not do this and only restrict enrollment and suppress arts and law faculties, even if the country can reduce the enrollment, society cannot eliminate this kind of books, and the educational and academic systems will lose their guidance and scope due to the stagnation of arts and law faculties. Not only will there be few opportunities for students who aspire to this in the future, but it will also only make young people who are dissatisfied with the status quo more likely to resort to desperate measures. This does not seem to be the right path for the Ministry to rectify the academic atmosphere and reform education. This is the fifth point to consider. All these five concerns are inevitable consequences of the Ministry's new plan. Our association is worried and must report them. Therefore, we implore the Ministry to understand our concerns, withdraw the order, and discuss a new plan at length. The future of education will be fortunate, and the painful plea for life on behalf of our association will also be fortunate. Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Federation respectfully kowtows.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau completed the compilation and submitted it to the Ministry of Education.

<h3 id="e201">The Ninth District Education Association Submits a Petition to the Education Bureau Requesting Equal Treatment for Teachers in Municipal Schools <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Launched the Organization of a Teachers' Federation</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency) The Ninth District Education Association, in response to the disparity in treatment between teachers in municipal, rural, and district elementary schools, has submitted a petition to the Municipal Education Bureau requesting that the treatment of teachers in municipal, rural, and district elementary schools be equal starting from the next academic year. The original petition is as follows: "Omitted above, the treatment standards for teachers in municipal elementary schools should be the same, regardless of whether they are in municipal, rural, or district schools. However, this is not the case. The salaries of teachers in municipal district elementary schools are one level higher than those in rural districts, and their annual seniority grade increases are based on the standard of one grade increase for every full year of service, and two grade increases for every three full years of service, and so on. However, the annual seniority grade increases for teachers in rural district municipal schools do not follow the standards issued by the bureau. They must have five full years of service to increase one grade, and ten full years of service to increase two grades. They are all municipal school teachers, but the treatment is very different, which is not fair in principle. It has been resolved by the general meeting to submit a petition to the Bureau for review and approval, starting from the next academic year, so that the treatment of teachers in municipal, rural, and district schools will be based on the standard annual seniority grade increase method, so as to achieve equality and fairness, omitted below."</p>
<p>It is also reported that the municipal school teachers in the district, in view of the organization of teachers' federations in municipal schools in the North and South cities, and the lack of contact between the municipal schools in the Ninth District, also believe that there is a need for organization. Teachers from Meilong, Longhua, Honglu, Zhangtang, Caonan, and Xinlong schools have launched an initiative and held a launch meeting at Longhua Elementary School at 2 pm yesterday. Wu Rugui, Tang Shugui, Zhu Yixing, Hu Wu峰, Zhao Jinwen, Chen Baozhao, Tan Chuanzhuo and other seven people were elected as preparatory members to be responsible for carrying out the work.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Mongolian Dictionary Publication Imminent <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>It is shameful to say that Mongolia is a part of our Republic of China; As for the "Mongolian Dictionary", I have never heard of anyone in the national writing community writing this groundbreaking masterpiece.</p>
<p>The Republic of China has been established for twenty-two years; People don't want to try to investigate and organize their own place, of course everything is isolated! Using the big to compare to the small, just like a family, holding five shares of property, at the very least, there should be five detailed and precise account books; if you don't set up account books, people will set up account books for you. Before September 18th, Manchuria was still our territory, and all the books and maps related to Manchuria's customs and products were written for us by Japanese writers as "ghostwriters" and "penmen". As a result, we gave away the property rights. The new term is called "non-resistance", and the old term is called "handing it over to others".</p>
<p>Manchuria is like this, and Mongolia is also a metaphor; many foreigners have set up account books for us; there is Schmidt's "Mongolian-German-Russian Dictionary" in 1839, Lavalevsky's "Mongolian-Russian-French Dictionary" in 1846, and Gorstinsky's "Manchu-Mongolian Dictionary" in 1895. In the mid-nineteenth century, many distant neighbors were already keeping accounts there; now, the Japanese writers' "Mongolian Dictionary", which took sixteen years of investigation and editing, will be published between this autumn and winter! The dwarves who are used to being "ghostwriters" or "penmen" are bothered, bothered.</p>
<p>It is said that this book is very rich, with tens of thousands of words, in addition to translating to Japanese, Chinese, Manchu, and Sanskrit are also included for comparison, and the price is about ninety Japanese gold. Although the price is expensive, after publication, there will definitely be a lot of Chinese people who want to buy it; The "dictionary source" of our territory does not need to be edited by ourselves, and we can feast our eyes for a hundred or so dollars. There is no need for officials; Chinese people are still officials, and Chinese people are really freehand friends.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Examination <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Yu</p>
<p>A "ring" was set up on the Shandong Road, and a couplet of "punching heroes in the three mountains and kicking heroes in the four seas" was hung up. Countless "old monks" who "collect yin and supplement yang" from famous mountains and temples, "strange Taoists" who "spread beans into soldiers", and "black shop owners" who sell "human meat fillings" and "green forest heroes" who "knock people down with drugs" came to press down "life and death documents", jumped on the "plum blossom pile", and showed their faces.</p>
<p>This method of "comparing skills" is very in line with the principle of "survival of the fittest", and is called "natural selection". It is like the football match of "future Chinese masters" in modern "foreign schools". Only by "winning two out of three games" can they win the "big silver shield" back, and "take a day off to celebrate". Although "fighting on the ring" is "individual" and "playing football" is "group", "survival of the fittest" is "the same principle".</p>
<p>From "fighting on the ring" to "playing football", it is very logical to have a "graduation examination". That's right, how could "scholars", "juren", "jinshi", "hanlin", and even "Zhuangyuan and Di" not be "competing skills"? Only by comparing in this way can we find talents who can "govern the country and secure the people". You see, once the imperial examination system is abolished, the country will be so bad, so you know that only by "hard-hitting" comparison can there be reason.</p>
<p>This time, China is carrying out "graduation examinations" in a swift and decisive manner. This is a matter worth praising. It is said that this will enable the talents cultivated under the same system, like the "Big A Fu" made in Huiquan Mountain in Wuxi, to have the same face, one hundred or one thousand. A "Big A Fu" with a missing nose must be remade before it can be sold on the market. Students are also like this. If they fail in one subject, at the very least, they must endure their temper and condescend to be "old children" for another year.</p>
<p>It is said that this will not only make the students who don't study hard study hard, but also sweep away the accumulated malpractices of "requiring scope", "pass", and "cheat sheets". The students who participate in the "graduation examination" are like standing on the "plum blossom pile" to "compare skills". Those who have no skills don't want to stand firm. This is really the way to "select real talents". I don't know what the intention of those who oppose the "graduation examination" is.</p>

<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The advent of all good fortune is like drinking ice cream. Is it just cooler in front of you, and not the same after drinking as before you drank it?</p>
<p>The kindness that a woman who sells everything gives you is like the wind from an electric fan. It's not real or natural at all.</p>
<p>The summer cicadas on the branches are like scholars who only sing high-pitched tunes. The more it knows and shouts, the more it doesn't know anything.</p>
<p>Summer is terrible, but not many people are sunburned to death by it. How cool is the night dew, but it kills tens of millions of people every year.</p>
<h3 id="e219">About Lan Caihe <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>The commonly said Eight Immortals myth is uniformly said everywhere as: "Han Zhongli, Zhang Guolao, Han Xiangzi, Tie Guai Li, Cao Guojiu, Lu Dongbin, Lan Caihe and He Xiangu". As far as I know, all places uniformly acknowledge that only He Xiangu is a female immortal, and the rest are male.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Sun Liangong's Literary Dictionary said that Lan Caihe is also female, it caused a certain gentleman to refute (see the Free Talk in this newspaper on the 15th). He cited a song from Chen Tao's biography in Lu Fangweng's Southern Tang Dynasty, suspected that Lan Caihe may be Chen Tao, and determined that Lan Caihe is a male immortal. However, I know that before Lu Fangweng; regarding Lan Caihe's record, there is the Continued Biography of Immortals written by Shen Fen in the Five Dynasties, saying "Lan Caihe does not know where he is from, he often wears a tattered blue shirt, six knotted black wood belt, more than three inches wide, one foot wearing boots, one foot barefoot. In summer, he adds cotton to his shirt, and in winter, he lies in the snow, with steam coming out of his breath. He often sings in the city and begs, holding a large clapper, more than three feet long, often drunk and singing, old and young all compete to watch::: seemingly crazy not:::." In terms of time, of course the Continued Biography of Immortals is much earlier, so in this way, the Southern Tang Dynasty's so-called "There is an old man in Nanchang! It is suspected to be Chen Tao and his wife, clearly is a compilation, and is not enough to prove it.</p>
<p>Lan Caihe's song, in the Continued Biography of Immortals, is:</p>
<p>"Treading song, Lan Caihe! How much can the world do? Rosy faces are like spring trees, time flies like a shuttle, the ancients went on and on, today's people come more and more. Riding a horse in the morning, seeing the green fields turn into white waves in the evening. Long scenery and bright sunshine are in the sky, the silver palace is high and towering!"</p>
<p>So it is also very different from what is recorded in the Southern Tang Dynasty. There is also a "Buy Sorrow Collection" compiled by Qian Shanghao (Zhenzhi) in hand, and there is also a Lan Caihe entry, and the lyrics are not much different from the Continued Biography of Immortals, except that "to Biluo" is mistaken for "see Biluo" and "green fields" for "mulberry fields," and the last two sentences are missing.</p>
<p>However, in the fairy round scene of the Kunqu opera Dream of Handan, all the Eight Immortals are put in at once, ｜Although it does not match the plot of Li Mi's Pillow Book and Ma Zhiyuan's Dream of Yellow Millet｜The role of Lan Caihe is played by an old dan voice, which is like the Western opera supporting roles are mixed with high and middle tones as the standard; Mr. Liangong may have been fooled by the Kunqu opera book by recognizing Lan Caihe as a woman.</p>
<p>If you go to see the performance of Xian Yuan, you will see that Lan Caihe is wearing a scholar's hat, wearing a blue embroidered jacket, and is decorated as a gentle Confucian scholar. Lu Dongbin also sings, "Lan Caihe is a Da Yuan Ben Le Hu official!" Then, the question of whether Lan Caihe is "male or female" will not be as "indistinguishable as male or female" as Mulan.</p>
<p>Because I supplemented a certain gentleman's rebuttal, I wrote this article again, and presented it to Mr. Liangong.</p>
<p>▲ In a recent column, there was a eulogy about my late father that does not match the facts. First, my late father's body was strong and tall. A coffin was specially made after his death, so the burial was delayed for two days. Although we who are children cannot fully be filial, we also seek peace of mind, so even the clothes and coffins were very spacious, comfortable and strong, which resulted in a delay of two days. Secondly, the thunderstorm was on the 13th, and the burial was on the 14th. The weather was very clear, and the corpse must be swollen in the abdomen after being struck by lightning. This is common knowledge and is not worth being different about. Thirdly, the relatives and friends who sent the burial and the workers were all there, and there was no act of gouging the face. Fourthly, my family started at sea, and the East Gate is the ancestral hall. Shanghai has always been the hometown, and Jiayi is actually a villa. The person's hometown is untrue, and the other statements are even more difficult to prove. Fourthly, the ancestor was nearly one hundred years old when he was alive, and my late father was also nearly seventy years old. The reporter must be at least seventy or eighty years old, otherwise it would be fabricated hearsay. Only this section is not worth mentioning. Fifthly, my family's ancestral precepts forbid taking concubines, so my late father never officially took a mistress. However, in his later years, he was disheartened by national affairs and was not without indulgence. On that day, due to the large number of male and female disciples of my late father, some female students came to mourn, but there was no transmission of a conflict. Now I point it out, and I hope that the correction is grateful, Wang</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Ten Hearing the Words Warns the Fragrant Heart, and the Hope of Conferring a Marquis is Vague.</p>
<p>Listening to the Song Shows Envy, and Repaying the Country Makes the Body Idle.</p>
<p>Guizhi knew that her mother was laughing for a reason, so she didn't ask too much. However, in some respects, the Zhao family's marriage seemed to be getting more and more real. If it continued in this attitude, the matter would naturally be successful. However, although Company Commander Zhao was a good person, she had never planned to have a military husband in her heart. Marrying a soldier was not her long-cherished wish. Thinking of this, she couldn't help but feel worried. She remembered that Liu Jiama on the west end of the street, her husband, was also a soldier. Why not take the opportunity to ask her what life is like as a soldier? At that time, she kept it in her heart and didn't say anything. Because she said to Jiang Shi, "Mom, you must have caught a cold. Lie down and rest for a while. Doesn't Liu Jiama have pills at home? I'll go get two to give you a sweat." Jiang Shi said, "No need, I can rest if I lie down for a while." Saying that, she lay down. Guizhi was a little worried that forcing her would arouse her mother's suspicion, so she didn't say anything that day. The next day, Jiang Shi was still tired. Guizhi said that she had to take some pills. After eating lunch, she walked to Liu Jiama's house by herself. They were also in the front and back courtyards. The front courtyard was a private school, where a Mr. Niu taught. Liu Jiama lived in the back courtyard with her son. Guizhi walked to the back courtyard, and Liu Jiama was washing cabbage leaves in the room. Seeing Guizhi, she pulled out two wet hands from the earthenware basin and smiled at her: "Rare guest, old girl, you have time to sit." Guizhi smiled and said, "No business, no visit to the Hall of Three Treasures, I have something small to ask you." Liu Jiama smiled and said, "Tell me. Pick what I can help with." Guizhi said, "My mom caught a cold yesterday." Liu Jiama said, "You want pills, I have, I have, I have. Come in, sit down for a while and then go, don't be in a hurry, it's warm in the inner room." Saying that, she lifted her apron, wiped her hands, and led Guizhi into the house. Guizhi said, "Liu Jiama, you are so frugal, you still keep the old cabbage leaves that you can't eat." Liu Jiama replied, "It's a pity to throw it away, grab a handful of salt and pickle it, and drink it with millet porridge, it's a good dish, if you don't believe me, try it." Saying that, she let Guizhi sit on the warm kang, took out a teapot from the kang eye, poured a cup of tea for her to drink. He smiled and said, "I can't even find a cigarette for you to smoke in a poor family." (One Hundred and Thirteen)</p>
<h3 id="e221">A Visit to the Film Studio <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhou</p>
<p>One evening, I was huddled in a birdcage-like writing room, burying my head in writing work. Day after day, I felt like a writing machine.</p>
<p>Shanghai's most prosperous area is almost isolated from nature. When spring comes, you can't see any peach blossoms or willows, and you can't hear any swallows or orioles. When autumn comes, you can't see any yellow leaves or red maples, and you can't hear any cold cicadas or mournful geese. You just change your clothes as the air temperature rises and falls.</p>
<p>The early summer of "red cherries and green plantains" has unknowingly passed in a hurry, and the hot summer of "floating melons and sinking plums" is coming again, but I, who live in the prosperous area of Shanghai, am very isolated from these. I only see a few snack shops selling ice cream and soda, and foreign goods stores selling straw hats and fans, and I know that "summer" has passed by half.</p>
<p>In March, I planned to go to Longhua to see the peach blossoms, but I didn't go in the end. A few days ago, Mr. Feng and others initiated the Minhang summer tour, but I was tied up by things and couldn't get away. Yesterday, I was a little free and the weather was good, so I went to the Gujiatai Garden on Lafayette Road to get some fresh air, and on the way, I went to the Tianyi Company to visit the filming of the film.</p>
<p>Tianyi Company is located at the end of Ganshidong Road in the French Concession. The company is surrounded by a bit of rural flavor. To the south of the company, there is a large open space, planted with vegetables and the like, and there are more bamboo fences and tile houses. The owners inside are all farmers and workers in short clothes and bare feet. Being there is like being in the countryside.</p>
<p>In the summer of the year before last, when the company first opened the filming of silent films, I came to visit with my friend Mr. Xu, but at that time, because of other things, I just walked around in a hurry and left. This time, Mr. Shao Zuiweng personally received me, accompanied me to the photography site to watch the filming, and told me about the current situation of the company.</p>
<p>Outside the photography site, it was originally a wide square. Now it has been greatly transformed, with pavilions, ponds, flowers and trees, which is quite like a garden. In the northeast of the square, a small L-shaped pond has been dug. The pond is surrounded by green iron railings, and the banks of the pond are covered with green grass, interspersed with clusters of orange-yellow small flowers, which are very beautiful. A few small trees, a little taller than people, are full of green leaves. To the south of the pond, there is a hexagonal pavilion. The pillars and railings are all painted with vermilion paint, which contrasts with the green grass and trees, making it particularly beautiful. Outside the pavilion, there is a small plot planted with corn and cucumbers. The actor Wei Pengfei is adding fertilizer to the corn. Mr. Wei often plays a simple and honest old farmer on the screen. Now he is really doing farmer's work, which is really meaningful.</p>
<p>Walking into the photography site, I saw two sets built in the field, both simple and unpretentious country houses. Mr. Shao told me: the south side is the set of "Flying Catkins", and the north side is the set of "Struggle". At this time, filming had not yet started, and the field was full of people in short clothes and straw sandals. If their faces were not made up, they would almost be mistaken for odd job workers at the photography site. Yuan Meiyun was wearing a tattered dress with holes all over it. It is said that she plays a poor girl in "Flying Catkins", whose life revolves in a gray fate. Liu Binghua and Bao Zhichao have both shaved their heads. Mr. Liu is the male lead in "Struggle", and Mr. Bao is the male lead in "Flying Catkins". They are both young talents recently discovered by Tianyi.</p>
<p>The female lead of "Struggle", Chen Yumei, was sitting idly on the side because she had no scene. She was wearing a white sportswear and a sports cap on her head. It turned out that she had just finished playing basketball.</p>
<p>"Dangdangdang" A bell rang, which was a sign that filming was about to begin. Then the people in the whole field immediately became busy. Some were setting up the lights, some were arranging the equipment. Director Qiu Baxiang, with a script under his arm and a pencil in his right hand, would tell the actors how to perform, and then run to the camera to see the position of the lens, directing the cameraman to move the camera. Each shot took only two or three minutes of formal shooting time, while adjusting the light, aligning the lens, arranging the equipment, and rehearsing the actors took twenty or thirty minutes. I only watched them shoot three shots, and more than an hour had passed. Seeing that it was getting late, I said goodbye to Mr. Shao and went back.</p>

<h3 id="e222">On Scolding <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Pei</p>
<p>Scolding, undeniably, is an art.</p>
<p>If the saying "words are the voice of the heart" is true, then scolding can be said to be the shadow of the soul: where there is scolding, there is also the soul.</p>
<p>Just as words have a positive and negative side, scolding has a distinction between what is intended within and what is intended outside.</p>
<p>If you scold "The weather is terrible, it's raining again!" This is scolding intended within, because you really hate the rain, and the scolding does not contain the meaning of "Oh, how beautiful, the rain dripping like women's tears!" as praise.</p>
<p>But scolding intended within is not art; what is artistic is scolding intended outside.</p>
<p>If you like to sleep and don't get up until twelve or one o'clock, but you are afraid of being discovered and criticized, then you can scold "I went to see so-and-so at nine o'clock that day, but they hadn't gotten up yet, truly decadent!" This proves that since you went to a friend's house at nine o'clock, you are an incorruptible early riser. If you scold like this, even if someone comes to see you before you get up, they will think your late rising is either because of a headache or because you were writing until dawn; if you say so yourself, it will be even more appropriate, and the idea that you are a sleepyhead will never enter their mind. If you are someone who wants to sleep but can't in reality, you can also scold like this. Anyway, only you know that the meaning of the scolding is not really to express your noble early rising, and at the same time, expressing it like this is not a bad thing, it just proves that late rising is enviable.</p>
<p>Transferring your own weaknesses to others, or to people who have the same weaknesses as you, and using them as the object of your scolding, you can unload your weaknesses one by one from yourself and become a relaxed person.</p>
<p>Scolding, undeniably, is an art.</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Origin of Pure Talk <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Anyone who knows a little about history knows that pure talk began in the Wei Dynasty, flourished in the Jin Dynasty, and declined in the Chen and Sui Dynasties. The Wei Emperor Wu, who composed poems with a spear across his saddle, actually killed Kong Wenju and harmed Mi Zhengping; the Wei Emperor Wen, who narrated classics and talked about literature, would also boil beans and burn stalks, brothers pressing each other. The fact that literati had to be forced into pure talk here can give an idea of their state of mind. Descending to the Jin Dynasty, the ferocity and cruelty of the Yi Zhao father and son were naturally even greater than those of the Cao Wei. Waving a duster and talking about metaphysics could both avoid disaster and gain fame. How could students not compete to admire this trend and reap both fame and reality? By the time of the Chen and Sui Dynasties, with the country devastated by war, the world in chaos, the bookish literati had no duster to wave and no metaphysics to narrate. The disappearance of pure talk was also a natural consequence, but the literati suffered. Modern pure talk seems to have changed its appearance. What is published in great detail in major and minor newspapers and magazines is mostly (1) natural disasters, (2) sexual sins, (3) the whereabouts and anecdotes of important people, and (4) the simultaneous mockery and scolding, suspected false or real news and criticisms of contemporary literati. "The weather today, ha ha ha," is indeed the ultimate in pure talk, and "There is joy in the teachings of morality, why be like this?" is even more so a subtle and profound, eloquent and passionate article. In the end, is it pure talk that misleads the country, or the country that misleads pure talk? This is really a bit difficult to say.</p>

<h3 id="e224">The Like of Lao Can <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>A few days ago, the "Free Talk" published an article on the art of the clown, which was really the most appropriate article for sending off Mr. Hu Shih.</p>
<p>After Hu Shih's departure, the country is suffering from too many, not too few, roles of the clown type, but after Mr. Feng's ridicule, I don't know how many people suspect he is scratching their wounds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when I flipped through "The Travels of Lao Can," I couldn't help but clap my hands and exclaim in wonder: among literati, there is actually the idea of creating a typical clown, like Lao Can!</p>
<p>What kind of person is Lao Can? He can write poetry, he understands medicine, he can manage rivers, he is good at predicting, and he also works as a Sherlock Holmes, able to detect suspicious cases and save the lives of three people. He has never held any official position, but his letter can reach the palace, reversing a major unjust case that has already been decided, and even Gang Bi, who is so stubborn, cannot but retreat. He has never been worth a penny, only shaking a handbell, but everyone is willing to give him thousands of dollars. He is "in the rivers and lakes, but his heart is in the court," a hermit of the mountains and forests, but constantly circling in the political vortex. Saying he is idle, he is really busy; saying he is busy, he is very free. The ideal character under Liu Tieyun's pen is also a typical character admired by all "clowns."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shih lectured at the Dongya Tongwen Academy in the 16th year of the Republic of China on the four thinkers of China in the past 300 years, Gu Yanwu, Yan Yuan, and Dai Zhen, besides Mr. Someone. I couldn't understand it after thinking hard. Now I understand, the ideal character in Hu Shih's mind is also the ideal character in Liu Tieyun's mind. Having found such a person, why not be happy? Moreover, Mr. Hu himself has already imitated him very closely, so he can go on stage without dressing up!</p>
<p>In this way, we can also understand why Mr. Hu Shih especially praised "The Travels of Lao Can" during the May Fourth Movement.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Summer Night <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>In the evening, the remaining heat of the day has not yet dissipated, and the wind is stagnant, not moving. Sitting indoors, I am sweating profusely. It feels like there are hundreds of hot worms crawling inside the blood vessels all over my body. I frantically wave the palm-leaf fan back and forth, and bean-sized beads of sweat are still streaming down my body. At this time, I thought of the loveliness of winter again, although in winter I had also cursed the severe cold that made people clumsy, timid, and decadent.</p>
<p>I remembered the words my father told me when I was a child, "A calm mind naturally cools down," so I turned on the electric light, moved the chair to the writing desk near the window, and randomly took a recently published book by Ms. Ding Ling, "Mother," from the bookshelf, intending to use forced reading to calm my chaotic thoughts. This method was indeed effective. In less than a quarter of an hour, the beads of sweat all over my body were dried by the gentle breeze blowing in from the window, and the palm-leaf fan naturally fell from my hand to my feet. I intimately felt the comfort after the heat.</p>
<p>However, another kind of annoyance followed, which was a small green worm with a sharp beak.</p>
<p>Probably because they were chasing the light, as soon as the electric light was turned on, these annoying little bugs flew in from outside the window in droves. At first, it was one or two: : : flying onto the lampshade, onto the desk, onto the pages of the book in my hand, onto my face, onto my hands. They made no sound, just crawling everywhere, or using their sharp beaks to peck at my face and hands with all their might, making people feel an extra uncomfortable slight itch and a surprise similar to being attacked by an unexpected enemy.</p>
<p>At this time, I didn't care at all about these petty clowns. When they flew onto the pages of the book, I just brushed them away with my hand; when they crawled on my face or hands, making me feel uncomfortable, I slapped them away with my hand. Immediately, a tiny corpse rolled to my feet. I only glanced at it with contempt, and still indifferently continued reading.</p>
<p>However, the green worms became more and more numerous. At this time, it was no longer one or two, but a large swarm: : : swarming and dancing in the air, making you dizzy. They flew onto the pages of the book, making the words look like pockmarks; they flew onto your face and hands, pecking here and there, making you at a loss; sometimes they would even fly into your clothes, and crawl gently like a thief, making you feel tingling all over, unable to catch them and unable to see them, so you had to put down the book and strip off your clothes to search. Moreover, this large group of clowns swarming and dancing actually made a lot of noise, squeaking, like the sound of silkworms eating mulberry leaves, which made people feel particularly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This disturbance made me very angry. I threw down the book and stood up abruptly, using angry and cold eyes to scan this group of swarming and dancing pests. With a heart full of revenge and a desire to eliminate them quickly, I quickly grabbed the fly swatter and swatted frantically: : : swatted: : : swatted, once, twice, three times: : : and then tiny corpses formed one pile, two piles, three piles. I stood before these piles of corpses, like a hero returning in triumph, or like a cruel and vicious tyrant.</p>
<p>It seemed that the massacre with the fly swatter was not enough to extinguish the anger in my heart, not enough to express my hatred for that group of clowns, so I thought of even more cruel tortures. I used the tip of the pen as an instrument of torture, stabbing them one by one. I watched those pitifully small lives struggle in vain, and I lit a lighter one by one to burn them, until the corpses in a row emitted a foul odor. At this time, I was using the greatest determination to deal with this group of disturbers. I thought that such a crazy massacre and such terrible torture would surely exterminate this group of disturbers and restore me to the comfort of quietly reading.</p>
<p>However, my plan ultimately failed. Those hateful green worms seemed to know nothing of the terror of massacre. As long as there was light, they still came in droves, still swarming and dancing, still crawling everywhere, still pecking at my face and hands. I frantically wielded the fly swatter, and small corpses piled up layer upon layer, but those that died died, and those that came still came. In the end, I had exhausted all my strength, beads of sweat were streaming down, I was panting, and looking at these disturbers who were not afraid of death, I could only grind my teeth and be angry. I had no ability to resist, so I shouted loudly to my wife, "Let's go for a walk on the road." To be honest, I ran away. I had already failed in the hands of this group of disturbers.</p>
<p>For the first time, I understood the meaning of the word "group." I understood the greatness of the power of the masses.</p>

<p>— IalesRenard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>(End of the last words)</p>
<p>Le Pichon: What skill? Do you want me to send you to a shoemaker to be an apprentice, as if punching a nail? Carrot Top: A shoemaker's or anywhere else. I can earn my own food, I can gain freedom.</p>
<p>Le Pichon: Too late, my poor Carrot Top. I spent so much money to educate you, just for you to nail soles?</p>
<p>Carrot Top: But if I told you, Dad, that I once wanted to commit suicide, what would you do?</p>
<p>Le Pichon: You say it like it's a big deal, Carrot Top.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: I swear to you, just yesterday I still wanted to hang myself.</p>
<p>Le Pichon: And you are still alive. It can be seen that you didn't want to die. But thinking of your failed suicide, you proudly raise your head. You think death has only tempted you. Carrot Top, selfishness will make you sharp-tongued. You only care about yourself. You think you live alone in the world.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: Dad, my brother is happy, my sister is happy, if Mom doesn't deliberately mess with me, as you say, I can cut off my tongue to feed the cat. Finally, as for you, you are the head of the family, people are afraid of you, even Mom is afraid of you. She will never hinder your happiness. This proves that some people in humanity are happy.</p>
<p>Le Pichon: You stubborn little thing, talking nonsense. Can you see the secrets in everyone's heart? Do you already understand everything?</p>
<p>Carrot Top: About my own affairs, I understand, Dad; at least I am trying to make myself understand.</p>
<p>Le Pichon: Then, Carrot Top, don't think about getting happiness. I can predict that you will never be happier than you are now, never, never.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: That's possible.</p>
<p>Le Pichon: I advise you to be patient, protect yourself, and when you are an adult and can be independent, you will be free, you can disown us, change a family, or change your temperament and temper. Before that, you can try to gain an advantage for yourself, suppress your feelings, observe others, even those who live with you; this will be very interesting; I can guarantee you will get many unexpected comforts.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: Undoubtedly, other people also have their suffering. But I will only pity them tomorrow. Today, I want to demand justice for myself. Whose fate is not better than mine? I have a mother. This mother neither likes me, nor do I like her.</p>
<p>"And me, do you think I like her?" Le Pichon suddenly said, very anxiously.</p>
<p>After hearing these words, Carrot Top raised his eyes to his father. He looked at his calm face for a long, long time, his thick mustache, where a mouth that seemed too shy to speak was hiding, his wrinkled forehead, the three wrinkles on the corner of each eye, and the drooping eyelids that made him seem to be sleeping when he walked.</p>
<p>For a while, Carrot Top couldn't say a word. He was afraid that the joy hidden in his heart, and the hand that he had caught and almost forcibly held, would all fly away.</p>
<p>Then he clenched his fist, threatened the village that was dozing over there, in the darkness, and exclaimed exaggeratedly, "Evil woman! You are perfectly wicked. I hate you."</p>
<p>"Don't scream," Le Pichon said, "In any case, she is always your mother."</p>
<p>"Ah!" Carrot Top replied, and he appeared frank and cautious again. "I'm not saying that just because she's my mother."</p>

<h3 id="e228">Gold Standard Plummets by Half a Yuan <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>▲ Banks Close Accounts on July 13th and 14th, Gold Trading Suspended ▲</p>
<p>The gold market began to decline yesterday, and the slump was quite severe. It was indeed an inevitable move after continuous maintenance. In the early morning, the overseas silver market in both Britain and the United States rose, and exchange rates fluctuated. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by five to seven cents, and even up to seven cents. American cotton soared by 84 pounds, stocks rose by over five yuan, and American wheat also increased by seven points. People were disheartened. The gross price immediately broke the 900 yuan mark, at 94-5 yuan. Supply-side resistance continued to fall rapidly. Major players such as Fuyu sold heavily. After opening, the exchange rate hardened and fell, then returned to level. Near noon, it once fell below 90 yuan, but was pulled up by the bank. The domestic market tightened. Later, it was reported that the Bombay market rose by 5.6 anna, and the exchange rate suddenly hardened again, falling all the way. It was heard that a certain Chinese merchant bank had sold some, but it was soon pulled up again. It was found that the industry tried its best to block the US dollar throughout the day, while the banks were pulling. Although people's hearts were bad, due to hedging activities, major players in the field, such as the Dalian Gang, hedged into silver futures. The demand was relatively peaceful. The market was mediocre. The red price was increased by 120 yuan as usual, and slightly eased. The daily market conditions are recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 884.8 yuan, a sharp drop of 21.9 yuan from the previous close. Commodities opened at 5.5 yuan. The exchange rate also opened firm. The near-term selling price was calculated as one shilling and three pence and one eight seven five for the British exchange rate, and 26.8125 yuan for the US exchange rate. Small traders tried hard to raise the price after the opening. Zhengjin bought October's half yuan and pushed it to 7.5 yuan. Zhengchang, Fuyu, and Hengxing sold together. A Jewish merchant wanted to sell October's US dollar at 5.625 but failed, and it fell to 2 yuan. But the appetite of retail investors was still strong. Huabi Pangeng all bought October's US dollar at 625. Yuansheng, Yongda, Xingyong, Qianchang, Xiangzhifeng, Yongyifeng, and Yongxian bought successively and rose to over 7 yuan. It was rumored that HSBC quoted British rise of .25 and American rise of .625. Yuanheng, Yuanmao, Yongtian, and Fayong also sold, and retreated to 3.8 yuan. Zhifeng, Yongyuanchun, Changsheng, Yongfeng, and McCallie pulled October's US dollar at 5.625 and rose to 7 yuan. Yuanmao Yong limited sales. People were confused. The banks all bought September's US dollar at .375. Although it retreated, it could still support, hovering around 6 yuan. Then, because Wanxing bought, it was pulled up 2 yuan from 4.5 yuan. Shenkang was pushed to over 7 yuan. Mitsui suddenly pulled October's US dollar half yuan. Wanxing, Changsheng, Yongshenkang, Yuansheng, and Yongyuanchun all came to buy, and it rose to 9.5 yuan. Hengxing and Zhaofeng sold for 7 yuan. After entering, Shanghai pulled September's US dollar 3125. McCallie pulled October's half yuan and 4375. The Dalian Gang and Fuchang Shenkang entered the market one after another, and it fell below 90 yuan, at .05 yuan. During the period, Da Fa and Yongyun sold one after another and were not affected. Near noon, retail investors pressed down slightly. The noon close was 888.9 yuan, and commodities were photographed at 8.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 888 . Commodities opened at 7.5 yuan. Because commodities, Tongyi, Bingxing, etc. tried their best to sell, Yuanmao Yong Hengyu Lili were on the buying side. The situation was stable, hovering around 8 yuan. It was because Mitsui bought October's half yuan and McCallie pulled September's 3125. After circling for a very long time, only one or two corners went up and down. When Bombay telegraphed a rise of 5 anna, there were no buyers for October's US dollar half yuan. Yuansheng, Yongqingfa, Yongdafa, Yonghengxing, etc. all came to sell, and it went to 5 yuan. McCallie pulled October's US dollar at 5.625. There were many limited orders at 5 yuan to support the situation. Before long, no one asked about October's US dollar at 5.625. The selling trend was flourishing. Fuyu, Yuansheng, Yongda, Decheng, etc. came to sell, and it retreated to 2 yuan. Zhengjin bought October's .625. Huabi bought September's 4375. Zhifeng Yong Shenkang bought and stabilized, to 4.5 yuan. Retail investors still pressed slightly lower. Finally, Huabi and McCallie all bought October's .625. Wanxing and Fuchang also entered. After entering, the bank sought to close October's US dollar at 5.625, and the closing price was 886.2 yuan. Commodities were photographed at 6 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 890.5 yuan, and the lowest was 882 yuan, with a difference of 8.5 yuan. As a result, there was a sharp drop of 20.5 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was because HSBC Bank's US exchange rate rose by .625, at 26.5 yuan, and the combined standard gold was over 905 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 19 yuan less than the previous close, with a slight difference of one yuan. The registered accounts for this month were 911 yuan, 899 yuan for July, and 889 yuan for August. The supplementary water in the morning was 911 yuan, and 908 yuan in the afternoon. The red price was increased by 120 yuan as usual. The market was slightly looser than before. Guest banks slightly supplied, and Tongfengheng, etc. in the field all bought at the added price of 120 yuan. The turnaround transaction was sluggish. The long side (Runchangyu) needed over 20 yuan, while the short side (Hengxing) was only willing to pay within 20 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange stopped trading June futures, only trading July futures. Trading was exceptionally light, with some varieties seeing no interest. Market prices were generally mediocre, with only slight gains. Some varieties saw no change of even five fen. If market prices do not change, trading is unlikely to improve. The reasons for change are conflicting; prices are already at a peak, but there are no weaknesses to exploit. Both buyers and sellers are therefore taking a wait-and-see approach, but sentiment remains strong. Overall, the trend showed little sign of either gains or losses, with a generally stable tone throughout the day and slight gains of five fen or one jiao per transaction. Among them, the 96 stock saw exceptionally strong trading compared to other varieties, with a volume of over one million, topping all traded varieties. The trend was also very positive, with a gain of 7 jiao 5 fen for the day. Other varieties saw only slight gains of about one jiao to three jiao. The entire 6 stock gained 5 jiao 5 fen. Reportedly, the 96 stock has historically seen the most trading from the northern faction, and yesterday, the northern faction was still aggressively buying. The total trading volume was 3,819,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in cash. Futures were dominated by the 96 stock, at over 1,000,005. Salt tax was only 760,000, consolidated tax only 515,000, demobilization only 460,000, the 19 customs tariff together only 350,000, and the 20 volume and 20 customs only 520,000. The rest were only 5,000 to several tens of thousands. Today, there will be an additional auction of August futures.</p>

<p>| Sharp Rise |</p>
<p>A report from New Feng Trading Company states that on Monday (the 26th), the New York stock market was influenced by the soaring prices of cotton and wheat. Agricultural stocks related to these commodities also experienced sharp rises. In addition, positive news from London boosted market sentiment. Stocks in the oil, automobile, brewing, and department store sectors are expected to continue their upward trend. The total trading volume for the day was 4.53 million shares. American cotton prices rose by 83 to 87 pounds per point, as it is generally believed that the government's plan to destroy a quarter of the cotton crop will succeed. At the same time, Texas is experiencing extreme heat and drought, leading to scarce sellers and soaring prices. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>Soaring American Cotton Prices Impact Yarn and Cotton Prices</p>
<p>Overall yarn prices are rising. The surge in American cotton prices has boosted market sentiment, prompting short covering. However, recent market conditions remain weak due to excessive inventory. Only a portion of traders are taking a bullish stance on American cotton and are redeeming and going long. However, market sentiment is not as tight as in the cotton market.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Renshang market, American cotton prices soared, improving market sentiment and prompting enthusiastic buying. Short positions were largely covered, with prices rising by 2.1, 2, and 3 jiao across all months.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were twenty to thirty sources of supply. Market conditions were initially tight, but later turned steady. Local merchants were initially active, so others followed suit, improving the situation. However, the merchants later reduced their activity, causing the thin Indica market to weaken. Thick Japonica from Changzhou, Suzhou, Tongzhou, and Nangang was slightly better. Tuyang thin Indica was soft, close to the angle. Shandong, Longkou, and Weihaiwei merchants bought over a thousand bags of thin Indica such as Qingjiao and Songsi. Prices fell slightly, and the Yin Yuan was unchanged.</p>
<p>(Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over twenty sources of supply from Hexia. White Japonica saw slightly improved sales, and the market was relatively firm.

<p>= New Wheat Grinding Factory Improves, Continues to Purchase Over 20,000 Bags =</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices surged across all months. The reported prices of foreign wheat rose to levels rarely seen in recent years. American wheat rose by 2 yuan 34 jiao, and Canadian wheat rose by 1 yuan 45 jiao. Prices of wheat from Jiangbei also rose by 1 to 2 jiao due to price increases by grain merchants. Therefore, after the opening, market sentiment was extremely enthusiastic, and outside buyers and some miscellaneous grain merchants actively bought, causing prices to rise by 3 to 4 fen. However, large factories continued to sell, with sales reaching 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. After the opening in the afternoon, prices jumped again and rose by another 1 to 2 fen. Afterwards, prices gradually fell as factories continued to sell. Sentiment suffered a setback, and prices fell by one fen from their highs. At the current stage, half of the price increase is due to reported price increases from abroad, and half is due to price increases of miscellaneous grains. If actual sales do not improve, it will be difficult to maintain excessively high prices. As a result, prices for the current month rose by 3 fen 7 li 5 hao, prices for July rose by 4 fen, prices for August rose by 4 fen 2 li 5 hao, prices for September rose by 4 fen 5 hao, prices for October rose by 4 fen, and prices for November rose by 4 fen 5 hao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a uniform and frantic surge in price. Foreign wheat quotations saw American wheat rise 2 yuan 34 jiao and Canadian wheat rise 1 yuan 45 jiao. As local traders had already prepared to buy extensively during the market downturn, they both eagerly covered short positions and drove up prices, causing a dramatic jump rarely seen recently. July reached a high of 3 yuan 9 jiao 9 fen, August reached 4 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, September reached 4 yuan 3 jiao 2 fen, October reached 4 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen, and November even reached 2 yuan 5 jiao. After the multi-sellers backed out, there was a slight drop of 3 to 5 fen, but the final results showed increases of one jiao for July, August and September, one jiao for October, and one jiao one fen for November. Current wheat prices have skyrocketed due to the surge in standard wheat and high prices from producing areas, with quotations for medium-grade wheat rising nearly one jiao, as factories are still holding back. Kaitai Zhou, Huangqiao, Hucheng, and Jiangbei wheat were quoted at 3 yuan 8 jiao, Zhenjiang wheat at 3 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, Wuxi wheat at 3 yuan 8 jiao, and low quality at 7 jiao. Hushu and Nanjing wheat were quoted at 3 yuan 7 jiao 3 fen, Hezhou wheat at 3 yuan 7 jiao 7 fen, Pukou wheat at 3 yuan 7 jiao 35 fen, and Wuyi wheat at 3 yuan 8 jiao, with low quality at 7 jiao 7 fen. A total of over 20,000 bags were opened and purchased by Fuxin, Fufeng, Shenda, Huafeng and Xinda.</p>

<p>Spring cocoons in Shandong's 臨眗 and Zhoucun are abundant. All silk factories have stopped operations.

<p>— Xiaozhi</p>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai Electric Power Company discovered that some users, colluding with mechanics, were engaging in shockingly large-scale electricity theft. After a thorough investigation by the police, several key criminals were arrested. It is said that a remaining suspect, Mr. Zhou (who studied in Japan to become an engineer), can imitate the lead seals on the screws of the electric meters with perfect accuracy (note: the seals were put in place by the Electric Power Company specifically to prevent electricity theft). He can also disassemble electric meters with high skill, adjust the dials to reduce the recorded electricity consumption, and then replace the meters with counterfeit lead seals. ::: He then contacts officials in the Electric Power Company who are responsible for this task on behalf of various factories, and later the factories provide him with a small reward. ::: The number of factories engaged in fraudulent activities is countless, and there is enough evidence to sue over twenty factories (note: nineteen of them are silk mills and silk weaving factories).</p>
<p>In the current social organization, of course, there are some so-called "gentlemen" and "upper-class Chinese" who will put on a facade of false rationality and say, "Shameless, lawless scum! Is theft acceptable or permitted by law? ::: A dignified returned student, what can't he do, that he has to do such a disgraceful thing! How lamentable! :::"</p>
<p>Indeed, indeed! The golden words of "decent", "content", and "law-abiding" "upper-class" gentlemen are the most beautiful and pleasing to the ear. However, on the other hand, we must truly calm our minds, use true reason, and at least pay attention to the following facts.</p>
<p>(1) How many students go abroad to study and return to China each year! Regardless of their actual knowledge, given the already overcrowded existing distribution system and the nepotistic nature of all sectors in China, is there still room to accommodate them? Of course, this refers to the group of poor students without connections. However, they are also human beings and have the same basic needs for life - they need to eat, they need to live and dress... But they cannot get any of these things, and they cannot just sit idly by and wait to starve to death. Naturally, the only way for the weaker ones who have a flawed or incomplete view of the current society and its system and who lack understanding and principles is to use their petty intelligence to engage in theft and other disgraceful acts that are "illegal" to the so-called "upper-class Chinese"! Knowing this, who should we severely reprimand? (2) According to reports, most of the factories engaged in fraudulent activities this time are silk mills and silk weaving factories. This shows the economic downturn in China's silk industry. China's silk production was once among the best in the world, but in recent years it has plummeted! On the one hand, this is indeed due to natural disasters, man-made calamities, and the failure of silk weavers to use scientific methods to improve production. On the other hand, it is truly due to the constraints of unequal treaties, which have allowed foreign artificial silk to dominate our entire silk market! (China's raw silk production is about 252,000 dan per year, while the amount of foreign artificial silk imported is also 130,891 dan!) Because of this, small-capitalized and poorly equipped Chinese silk mills are inevitably approaching collapse and decline. In the simple calculations of businessmen, "stealing electricity" is a small gain. As for "being dragged into the legal court," how could they not know about it?</p>
<p>In short: Theft is real, breaking the law is real, and being disgraceful to upper-class Chinese is also real, but their misguided views and lack of principles are even more real! In addition to these "realities," we must also recognize that social problems have become extremely acute. Of course, this is also a reality!</p>

<p>— Xian</p>
<p>One day, A Shun's father woke up. His wrinkled face was always so gloomy. Ever since he had owed more than thirty yuan last year, the villagers of 溪村 had never seen A Shun's father smile, except for the slight twitching of the corners of his mouth with a "Hmm, hmm." On this day, unexpectedly, after he got up, while washing his face with cold water, two "coo, coo" sounds entered A Shun's father's ears from the eaves. He dropped the washcloth in disbelief, stepped over the threshold, walked to the threshing ground, looked up, and two pigeons fluttered their wings and flew backward with "coo, coo" sounds. At this moment, A Shun's father smiled. It was a pity that his son and daughter-in-law did not see it. He muttered to himself again, "Hmm, hmm, it's going to rain one of these days."</p>
<p>As if he were pleased, he ran into the kitchen, swallowed two bowls of cold rice, wiped his mouth, picked up his ever-present dry tobacco pipe from the corner of the wall, and although he had not been to town for a long time to buy a bundle of dry tobacco for twelve copper coins, sucking on the empty pipe had the same effect. He walked to the threshing ground again like a leisurely farmer. The innocent singing of the duck herding girl, Zhao Jie, came from the riverbank. Today, A Shun's father was not annoyed by this song. He thought that Zhao Jie was a very likable child. The distant mountains were not yet illuminated by the sun at this time, and the sky was gloomy. "Coo, coo," this lovely bird of happiness flew over A Shun's father's head again. "Hmm, hmm, it's going to rain one of these days!" A Shun's father smiled, smiling like a child seeing someone selling candy.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew, and A Shun's father seemed to feel a few raindrops on his face. He still didn't believe it, and when he stretched out his rough, dark palm, the rain became heavier and heavier. Suddenly, the sound of "It's raining!" cheered throughout the village. His son and daughter-in-law had already rushed from the shed. They were running so fast, and Zhao Jie, the duck herding girl, followed closely behind. A flock of ducks were racing along the bank of the field, "quack, quack."</p>
<p>"Dad, it's raining!" the son shouted, panting. Rain was falling on everyone's head, and everyone knew it was raining, but A Shun's father seemed to have just discovered it. He raised his head and looked at the sky. He absentmindedly wanted to smoke his dry tobacco pipe, took a few puffs, raised his dry tobacco pipe, and gently tapped it a few times on the rain-soaked threshing ground, as if to remove the ashes. A Shun watched his father's absentmindedness, and in his heart, he was calculating that since it was raining, this year's harvest would not be worse than last year's. As long as the price of rice rose when it was put on the market, after paying off the debt of more than thirty yuan, there would still be several tens of white silver pieces left over. Tomorrow, he would brave the rain to go to town to buy a bundle of dry tobacco for his father... In fact, as long as it rained, A Shun's father would no longer care about dry tobacco. He looked up at the sky, and the thought that turned in his mind was - the debt of more than thirty yuan.</p>
<p>He smiled slightly. "It's going to rain one of these days," he suddenly realized that the three of them were standing in the heavy rain as if they were frozen. "Grandpa A Shun, aren't you going inside to change your clothes?" After saying that, the three of them laughed.</p>
<p>That night, the old man did not mention the debt of more than thirty yuan, and the son did not feel the blisters on his feet throbbing. Laughter filled this small three-room cottage. A Shun had already obediently climbed into bed to sleep.</p>
<p>"As it was said, we country people never do bad things, sin - does heaven punish us by starving us to death?" Today, A Shun's father suffered from a laughing illness, and he laughed again without knowing it.</p>

<p>— Ben</p>
<p>"Why has older sister become so beautiful?" This was a big question from the ten-year-old younger brother.</p>
<p>"Why isn't older sister like she used to be—always jumping, laughing, and immersed in innocent happiness? And mother is also acting strangely. In public, she wears a forced smile, but behind people's backs, she just sobs and sighs, especially late at night, or in the clear mornings at dawn." These were all things the young brother couldn't understand; he just pondered them secretly.</p>
<p>Because his older sister had become beautiful, the younger brother also began to have hopeful dreams, which truly troubled the gray-haired, frail mother. The younger brother often threw up his old, tattered clothes and threw himself into his mother's arms, scratching his little mouth and saying: "Mommy, older sister is wearing pretty clothes, I want to wear them too!" This was like a sharp knife cutting at the mother's heart, but she could only suppress the grief rising in her throat and say in an unnatural, loving tone:</p>
<p>"Good boy, don't pester me. When you grow up like your older sister, I'll make you two sets too. It's not popular now—and, good boy, you need to understand things. Even if I made them for you now, wouldn't you just ruin them when you go scavenging in the trash?"</p>
<p>"Um, um, I want them::: When I go scavenging, I know to take them off and leave them at home!"</p>
<p>"Good boy, stop pestering me. Hurry up and shoulder your bamboo basket to find a living. Go early, come back early, and don't loiter outside. Come here, I've saved a bowl of cold noodles for you to eat. Alas!"</p>
<p>When the younger brother heard his mother's "Alas," he immediately glanced at her face. At that moment, his mother's face truly startled him—pale and cloudy, a mask full of wrinkles. He automatically left her embrace. Having cold noodles to eat was, of course, another reason he stopped pestering her.</p>
<p>Two years ago, their hometown suffered a devastating flood. In the middle of a stormy night with thunder and lightning, the father put on a raincoat and bamboo hat to try and reinforce the dam, but unfortunately, he never returned. The next morning, the whole family was floating in a watery world. Fortunately, a boat carrying refugees from a distant village passed by. After much pleading, the mother, older sister, and younger brother were rescued. They floated along, eventually drifting into this paradise-like city.</p>
<p>After arriving in the city, the mother and her two children experienced a period of begging door to door.</p>
<p>Later, the older sister found work in a silk factory, the younger brother shouldered his bamboo basket to scavenge through the trash cans along the streets, and the mother, with her gray hair, stayed home and ate whatever they could find. People saw that they were very poor, but in a dark, damp kitchen, the family of three was reunited and quite happy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, less than three months later, the silk factory shut down, so the older sister also stayed home all day. Mother and daughter stared at each other, and the hardship of life was beyond words. Therefore, the younger brother's work became even more urgent, and he had to shoulder his bamboo basket late into the night to scavenge for a living in the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>One night, it was already late, and he was squatting next to a trash can on the street when suddenly a young man, holding a woman's hand, flew past him and went into a brightly lit hotel ahead.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>He saw clearly that the woman was indeed his older sister. He wanted to chase after them, but in an instant, they were gone. So, feeling gloomy, he shouldered his bamboo basket and went home. Because of this, he didn't even bother to pick up cigarette butts, rotten cloth, paper scraps, and other things he could sell along the way.</p>
<p>When he got home, he blurted out this question to his mother: "Mom, I just saw older sister holding a strange man's hand going into a big hotel. Who was that? What were they doing? Why didn't they take us with them? Mommy, I want two new sets of clothes too!"</p>
<p>"Bah, are you crazy? Your older sister clearly went back to work—stop pestering me! What new clothes? I told you a long time ago, when you're big, as big as your older sister, I'll definitely make them for you::: How much did you find today?"</p>
<p>"Um, um, um, only two hundred cash, and I ate six cash worth of cold noodles."</p>
<p>In the crowing of the rooster at dawn, the younger brother, full of questions, vaguely heard his older sister's voice, his mother opening the door, followed by "I was so sleepy!", "I've been waiting for you half the night!", "Two dollars!" Alas!" A few miserable sounds.</p>
<p>Correspondences from Store Clerks</p>
<h3 id="e252">Unbearable Responsibility <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a matter that I wanted to ask you about. However, I have been hesitant to do so because I am afraid that my lack of knowledge and poor writing skills may result in an inadequate expression. But now the reality is unbearable. Therefore, I would like to respectfully present the detailed events as follows:</p>
<p>My teacher—who runs a store in a rural town—also assumed the responsibility of collecting land taxes three years ago (that is, the local bailiff). At that time, all the local property owners (that is, landowners) were responsible for guaranteeing him to the county government. Unfortunately, in recent years, the rural economy has suddenly collapsed, and all the rural households are struggling to find food, let alone pay the annually increasing land taxes on desolate tombs and dilapidated houses. As a result, the amount owed by the bailiff has gradually increased. Until May of last year, the bailiff was detained and held for payment. However, after he was detained, no one raised funds, and there was no way to raise funds. According to the old practice of the county, if the bailiff is unable to manage, the original guarantor should be responsible for handling it. However, although the county government issued a warrant to summon the responsible property owners, after they made some efforts with the people in the county government, the county government no longer mentioned it. Now, more than a year has passed, and my teacher himself feels that prison life is unbearable, and his family is suffering extremely. Therefore, he is willing to declare bankruptcy to resolve the matter. However, he himself is in prison, his wife is a rural woman, and his children are young. They don't know what to do. Now, he and his family have entrusted the incompetent and powerless me to handle the matter. Therefore, I respectfully ask you, the wise one, to give me detailed instructions. I would be deeply grateful! (1) What procedures can be used to make the county government execute bankruptcy? (2) Can private debts owed at the time of bankruptcy be included? (3) Will there be further lawsuits after voluntary bankruptcy? (4) Although the total assets may not be enough to cover the debts, is there any reason to request a certain amount for the family's living expenses? (5) If a lawyer is hired to handle the matter, can the litigation and legal fees be paid from the assets?</p>
<p>Wishing you good health! Respectfully, Store Clerk Zhang Hua</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This case cannot be resolved by bankruptcy alone. If your teacher has indeed embezzled tax money, then in addition to seizing his property, he must also be detained and pursued for the full amount. After the full amount has been recovered, he will also be punished. The source of tax revenue, which is vital to the country, cannot be arbitrarily embezzled by the tax collectors. If your teacher has not embezzled anything, and the tax shortfall is indeed due to the people's failure to pay, then your teacher has no responsibility at all. The county government's abuse of authority in detaining an innocent person for years is an inappropriate punishment that can be appealed to the provincial government and the Department of Finance in accordance with the Administrative Appeal Law. Once you apply for bankruptcy compensation, the embezzlement charge will be confirmed.</p>
<p>When each county collects land taxes, it must create a printed receipt book. The first copy is for notification, the second copy is a receipt, called a license, and the third copy is a . In theory, before the is opened, the should be handed over to the tax collectors for distribution. The property owners, based on the amount on the , seal and deliver the payment, and obtain the license as proof. For any property owner who has not completed the payment, the license should be connected to the stub. After the deadline, the collection office should open and engrave a clear list, and hand it over to the tax collectors for supervision. Therefore, "self-sealed delivery to the counter" and "receipt (license) not separated from the stub" are truly the heavenly principles of the tax system. However, the results of actual investigations show that very few counties can handle it this way. Most counties nominally make changes, but in reality, they reserve room for fraud. Now, let's write down two of the most common so-called changes in various counties: (1) Some counties create the printed receipts very late; for example, even in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), they have not completed the creation of the receipts for the 20th year. What they rely on to collect taxes is a small ticket. Each field has a printed stub, which has a number and indicates the amount of silver to be paid. Unless the full amount is paid, it cannot be cut from the stub. A small ticket, however, is just a temporary receipt, it is not limited to one for each field, and the amount is filled in at any time. Therefore, in these counties, if I owe 1,000 yuan in taxes this year, I can negotiate with the collection office to pay half of it first. If you have enough face, you can even pay less. Therefore, there are often many people without power whose taxes are paid by the big gentry. Small households pay 70-80% of the tax to the big households, the big households pay 50-60% of the tax to the county government, and the county government only remits 40-50% to the provincial government. Layer upon layer of embezzlement, officials and gentry colluding in broad daylight. (2) In many counties, after the receipts are created, the first notification copy and the second license copy are cut off at the same time and handed over to the tax collectors for collection. This method also has many drawbacks. To put it bluntly, once the stub is separated, it can be considered as fully received; to put it mildly, it can also be considered as not received at all. According to the editor's investigation, almost every tax collector in these counties is cheating, but some are just more daring than others. We don't blame them too much, because this system really has a seductive effect. Zhang's teacher probably encountered this kind of county, so the editor does not fully believe that he is completely free of wrongdoing (or is he wrong?). Now that the county government has spoken officially, it is difficult to tell the truth. For now, we believe that he should try to hand over the embezzled money himself. For those who have truly not received the money, he can contact all the tax collectors and truthfully report the matter to the county government. They are bound to feel sympathy and help. Moreover, for the sake of a permanent solution, he should demand the implementation of the "self-sealed delivery to the counter, receipt not separated from the stub" method, so as to avoid suffering the loss of this "official talk" again.</p>
<p>The editor is from Jiading County, not far from Shanghai. There are certainly many politics that we can't stand in our area, but the collection system is indeed handled reasonably well. Self-sealed delivery to the counter and stub not separated from the receipt have been implemented for a long time. Our tax payment procedure is very similar to buying a train ticket at the train station. Even if we are short one or two coppers, the license cannot be cut off; we would rather have the money returned. The tax collectors' responsibility is only to urge; at worst, they will be dismissed. The provincial government's Department of Finance can only urge other counties to remit the money; it cannot urge us in Jiading, because in the end, the county government can submit a request to check the stubs, as ironclad proof of whether there is money or not. However, this method is also very beneficial to tax revenue: in normal years, the amount collected within twelve months is always between 90% and 95%. Other counties probably do not have such a good record. It can be seen that the method of making changes is completely a method of cheating.</p>

<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>"The master won't be coming tonight, why so many dishes?"</p>
<p>"There's also Mr. Li..." Long Hair's words were always short and to the point.</p>
<p>"Mr. Li?" Auntie A-zhen, this young woman, had become very alert after being trained by the concubine. She quickly pretended to have misspoke and said, "Oh, that's right!"</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Mr. Li came downstairs to find a match to light a cigarette. A-zhen deliberately flattered him and said,</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, dinner is almost ready, don't go out?" A knowing smile spread across her face, her eyes rolling upward as she watched Shi Qiao's face. Truly, A-zhen's smile, pure and innocent, was sometimes more charming than the third concubine. Shi Qiao didn't answer her. He lit his cigarette and went back upstairs.</p>
<p>The third concubine wouldn't let time go to waste. She overheard the sound of leather shoes going upstairs and peeked out from the door.</p>
<p>"Li, Li:::" She felt the difficulty of addressing him for the first time. If she called him Mr. Li, it would sound like she was addressing her own cousin, and people would be suspicious, wouldn't they? Calling him by his name alone didn't sound like she was addressing an elder! Calling him "brother" was also awkward! And, no matter how bold a woman you were, it would be a bit embarrassing! Fortunately, her expressive eyes had already made Shi Qiao walk towards her.</p>
<p>"You just got back? Come, come sit here!" She pulled Shi Qiao to a long sofa and sat down next to him. Shi Qiao absentmindedly looked at her legs—she deliberately</p>
<p>"Don't, don't, you bad thing!"</p>
<p>Shi Qiao smiled slightly, tossed his messy hair back, and stared at her face, which was smugly looking at him askance. The third concubine believed that this angle of looking askance showed Shi Qiao's best features: his hair was still messy, his nose was high, his lips were thin, and his jaw forcefully outlined a long face. Looking down, his often-washed clothes had shrunk, tightly showing off the muscles of his whole body. His arms, bent forward, showed a kind of masculine brute force::::: The third concubine's imagination came more quickly than a man seeing a woman's flesh. She was used to seeing men in society who were polished and refined, those were all bland apples. Ah, look, this is such a stimulating coconut, a tropical coconut!</p>
<p>But the coconut was still thinking about some things—like what happened to Zhang Honglie and Zhou Shaoping today, whether the Student Volunteer Army was organized, and the matter of planning a magazine to promote resistance against Japan. These things were, of course, things that the third concubine did not understand and did not want to understand. But Shi Qiao had never thoroughly understood them either! Moreover, these things were not going smoothly, and he was feeling upset and unhappy.</p>
<p>Soon, wine came to relieve his boredom. The table was piled high with dishes, and he ate shamelessly.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Small Company's Production Sees the Light of Day Again <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>= The Central Film Censorship Committee Opens the Door to Convenience: The Release of Films with Supernatural, Sensual, and Martial Arts Themes</p>
<p>Since 1931, after the Central Film Censorship Committee adopted a strict approach, countless domestically produced Chinese films have been banned. As a result, the atmosphere in the film industry became clear, and the spirit of the film industry was boosted. However, the number of films released sharply declined, and many companies went out of business. In two years, small companies have been eliminated, and now there are less than thirty left.</p>
<p>Crude and poorly made films are not often seen now. However, in the past year, more than a hundred films produced by small companies have not been approved by the Central Committee. So, in the spring of 1933, eighteen small companies jointly submitted a petition to the Central Committee, and surprisingly, they achieved considerable results not long ago.</p>
<p>It is said that in order to sympathize with business difficulties and maintain the future of domestically produced films, the Central Committee formulated a special method and issued a "Temporary Permit for the Public Screening of Unapproved Domestically Produced Films." The deadline is six months. All domestically produced films, whether screened or not, that have been banned can receive this preferential treatment. As a result, the banned films surprisingly had the good fortune to see the light of day again.</p>
<p>Although the period is only six months (from June 15 to December 15 of this year), each film can be shown unhindered throughout the country during those six months. Even if it cannot make money, it can at least recover part of the capital invested in filming. Small companies can maintain their business for a few more years with this unexpected income. Or, in these two or three years, they may be able to shoot a few more good films, which would be of great benefit to the future of domestically produced films. This must be said to be a virtuous policy of the gentlemen of the Central Film Censorship Committee. But:::</p>
<p>This not only benefits small companies, but also benefits small cinemas in the interior. In order to cater to the tastes of local residents, most inland cinemas specialize in screening domestically produced films. In the past two years, only a few large companies have produced them. The quantity is small, and the rental price is high. Demand exceeds supply, and there is a constant sense of film shortage. In the past six months, due to the impact of economic depression, there has been a situation of bankruptcy. This time, the products of small companies are coming in an endless stream, which is no different from a cloudburst in a severe drought, and indirectly they have also received the blessing of the Central Committee. It kills several birds with one stone (and some residents in the interior can also feast their eyes and satisfy their low-level interests). Of course, it is also a good move.</p>
<p>As far as I know, small companies have shipped more than forty films to the interior in the past ten days. It is estimated that at least ten films will be screened in Shanghai in July. Two-thirds of them are represented by the Lianhua Company or the Central Company. Of course, films with sensual and martial arts flavors occupy a significant place, and the number of films with supernatural themes is also alarming. Perhaps the Mingxing Company's "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" and the Youlian Company's "Female Knight Errant of the Desolate River" will become popular again and reappear in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Of course, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Once this trend starts, what impact will it have on morality and people in various parts of the country, especially in the interior where culture is closed and superstition is deeply rooted? We have not yet had time to discuss in depth whether the original principles that the Central Film Censorship Committee used to ban films have been abandoned. But we can see that the surface purpose of the Central Film Censorship Committee is to maintain the small companies that produce domestically made films. In today's situation of empty national treasury and social depression, perhaps this is also a "stopgap measure" in a situation where there is no other way (as said by a certain member of the Central Committee). However, I hope that a fundamental solution will appear in the near future.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e255">After Watching "The Road to Fitness" <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Hairong</p>
<p>The theme of this film is really novel. It uses the life of street performers who wander the world as a background to write about the cruelty of the old society. We can vaguely see a hideous face of the old society on the screen.</p>
<p>Speaking of the entire script, we acknowledge that its consciousness is good, but there are some flaws. For example, Yun Sheng, a wealthy man's son, is also eager to talk about love when his studies have not been successful and he cannot live independently. And in order to achieve his ultimate goal, he actually breaks his engagement with his original fiancée and marries his lover, the street performer. Although his kind of classless love is pure, when we criticize him from an objective point of view, this kind of behavior of rushing to talk about marriage and disregarding his own studies is not a proper path for a young person to take.</p>
<p>The director's skill is very good. He has staged a very complex and tortuous story in an orderly manner, so that the audience does not feel any boredom from beginning to end. This is where he succeeded. However, I think that his depiction of the death of Ye Feifei's grandmother and mother is a bit too long, so that the script cannot be very compact, which is a pity.</p>

<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>This is a work written and starring by Ai Xia herself. Although it cannot be said to be an experience talk based on her own experiences, it is at least better than those who create stories behind closed doors, right? But although the expression is so realistic, there are still many contradictory points in the consciousness.</p>
<p>Isn't there a slogan here that shouts "Thorough love"? But can the love process and motivation between Jiang Tao Tao and Yu Leng be said to be "thorough"? Tao Tao is a romantic woman. She doesn't know what chastity is, she only knows how to seek satisfaction of sexual desire; Yu Leng is a restrained man, he doesn't know what love is, he only needs money and life. Their so-called "thorough love" is based on sexual desire and money. So even if Tao Tao doesn't commit a crime and Yu Leng doesn't back out, their ending will not be good, because love is not like this at all.</p>

<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>The objects of the concept of love for modern women in today's society are mostly nothing more than money and handsome men. Some only need money and are satisfied with material comfort. Some want to find men who are both wealthy and handsome and of comparable age. When any one of them is dissatisfied, they will boldly disregard the law, morality, reputation, etc., and commit various crimes and dark secrets.</p>
<p>Jiang Tao Tao, the protagonist in "A Modern Woman," belongs to the latter type. The original theme of such a good background could have revealed the dark secrets as much as possible, if the script itself did not stick to anyone's past facts. However, the various tragedies and comedies produced by the diverse prosperity of society cannot be fully depicted in "A Modern Woman."</p>
<p>Wasn't that reporter an old friend of Tao Tao? After not seeing each other for three years, there must be a more intimate feeling after a long separation, but a few days after they met, Tao Tao asked him, "Do you love me?" The reporter was stunned, and it didn't seem like he was hesitant. It was really embarrassing. The death of his child, the loss of his job, his loving wife's divorce, and his mistress's imprisonment must have been the most tragic and heart-wrenching time for Yu Leng, but the screen did not give the audience any deep or tense feeling. Tao Tao met her friend An Lin after she was imprisoned. They should have been surprised at each other, but it wasn't explained. Aren't these minor flaws?</p>
<h3 id="e258">After Seeing "Spring Water Love Waves" <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Heshan</p>
<p>Every day when I open the newspaper, I am struck by news of abduction, rape, fraud, abandonment, and so on. The cruel unfolding of a deformed society has cultivated countless dark sins. "Food and sex" are inherent human nature, especially for the wealthy class who are "well-fed and warm," they treat women as excellent forms of entertainment. At the same time, women's vain pursuits and weak will have become a common phenomenon in today's society. Especially today, after the semi-abandonment of the restraints of traditional ethics, and without the true realization of women's liberation, it gives men an easy opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>"Spring Water Love Waves" is a film that exposes this kind of sin. It loudly calls to awaken the illusions of women who are being played with, and especially gives a strong warning to those who abuse women. The consciousness is quite healthy. At least it is more relevant to the needs than unrealistic and empty questions.</p>
<p>What cannot be buried in this film is the director's contribution. He used light and skillful techniques, cleverly connecting the extremely ordinary story, narrating it in such a compact and profound way. The pictures are not wasted at all, and the descriptions are very powerful. Regarding the sorrow of A Mao's encounter, it especially grasps the sympathy of everyone. Every change and evolution in the play, and the contrast between bitterness and joy, all seem natural and reasonable. In terms of performance, no major shortcomings can be found.</p>
<h3 id="e259">The Slump of Hollywood Directors <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Shichun</p>
<p>The slump in Hollywood is now being created piece by piece. The actors have already felt the panic of the environment, and the directors may not be affected by this trend, but the devastated Hollywood cannot maintain the dignity of the directors after all.</p>
<p>Now there are four directors in Hollywood who are panicking because they have been idle for a long time without getting work. They have no way to maintain their lives, so they united and came up with a wonderful method. They gave up directing work and became actors. What a sad thing this is! One of these four directors is the famous Karl Vores, who has been a director in Hollywood for more than ten years. Fifteen years ago, a Broncho Billy he directed received unparalleled reputation, but now he can't even maintain his life. What a pity. There is also Ferre P. Smalley, who once enjoyed the reputation of first-class director in Universal, is now also idle in Hollywood, unable to find work to solve the bread problem. There is also a beast film director Frank P., and the most embarrassed one is called Sa Mairs Li Gai, who is heavily in debt, owing thousands of dollars. Because the directing life could not support their own bodies, these four directors lowered their status and acted in a film, acting as actors themselves. The film is called "Power and Glory," and of course it is a work full of depictions of bitterness.</p>

<p>"Trouble in the Abdomen"</p>
<p>Also known as "Suppressing Communists in Southern Jiangxi"</p>
<p>The Communist bandits in Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei are indeed the "trouble in the abdomen" of our nation. Last autumn, under the pressure of the central army, they invaded south in droves, hoping to occupy Guangdong as a base. Fortunately, Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Southern Route Communist Suppression, was prepared and led his troops to cooperate in the suppression, driving the Communist bandits back to their old nest. The fierceness of the battle and the greatness of the sacrifice are the most worthy of record in the history of communist suppression.</p>
<p>"Trouble in the Abdomen" is a battle film taken on the battlefield at the risk of death by the accompanying journalist at the time. The content ranges from the communist bandits' invasion of the south to the overcoming of the bandit areas, with very detailed records. The brightness of the light in this film is the best of all war films. It has now been shipped to Shanghai and is scheduled to be premiered at the Capital Grand Theater in Nanjing on the 28th. As for Shanghai, it has been decided to be premiered at the Beijing Grand Theater.</p>

<p>— Siping</p>
<p>After Wahlduk finished carving, he happily said whether this time it looked like it. Next time, he would carve a marble statue. A knock on the door startled them, and Lily quickly hid behind the curtain to put on her clothes.</p>
<p>The uninvited guest was a tall soldier, wearing a military officer's uniform, with gray hair, a stiff mustache on his mouth, and wearing a pair of glasses. One look at him knew he was a pervert. The alluring eyes saw Lily fleeing behind the curtain and jumped out of fire. The officer was Count Mazi Bashiber, and Wahlduk did not dare to offend him, so he reluctantly shook hands with him. The Count said that he was passing by here, saw the lights in the room, so he came in to ask if the stone statue carved for him was ready.</p>
<p>Lily dressed and shyly walked out from behind the curtain. The officer stared at her at a glance, said "Good!" and turned to ask Wahlduk to introduce him. Wahlduk reluctantly did the introduction. Lily gave a village girl's salute, but the Count solemnly lowered his head and kissed her jade hand. He treated her like a noble lady. He used his seductive means to get her to talk. But Lily was a little scared in front of this stranger, fearing that her aunt would wake up at this time. She sat uncomfortably and was about to leave. When Wahlduk sent her out the door, he whispered to ask her if she would come again tomorrow night. Lily also whispered back to see.</p>
<p>When Wahlduk came back, the Count looked at him with malicious intent, knowing that Lily was just Wahlduk's model. The Count privately thought he had a plan.</p>
<p>He turned his deceptive tricks and thought of going to the bookstore. That old monster is easy to deal with. He can find out her price soon. As for the young sculptor's resistance, there is no need to worry about it. In the Count's eyes, the girl herself is also not a concern. He is an old hand at playing with women with money::::: (To be continued)</p>
