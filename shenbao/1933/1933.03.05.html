<p>時評</p>
<h3>承德失陷　乃</h3>
<p>自東北三省失陷東北軍退守錦州以後。守土將吏即昭告吾人以决心禦侮。然不久而錦州又告失陷矣。由錦州至退守榆關。抗敵禦侮。又復文電皇皇。然不數月而榆關又告失陷矣。今茲而及熱河。抗敵禦侮之呼聲。誠哉其甚囂塵上。然熱河今又何如乎。</p>
<p>錦州之失也。北方來電。曾宣傳其如何抵抗。然外電消息。則日人兵未血刃。我方亦未以一彈相遺。榆關之失也。北方來電。亦舖張其抵抗之勇。然究其實際。恐亦不過犠牲少數之部隊。以取彼抵抗之虚聲而已。否則榆關重鎭。何以僅配置一二團之兵力。且將士而果有抵抗之决心也。則以滬凟平原。十九路軍猶能支撑月餘。錦榆天險。何至淪陷崇朝。由是以觀。吾人不能不確信自九一八事變以至錦西之失陷。守土將吏所採取者爲以無抵抗圖苟安之策。而錦州榆關之失陷。則爲藉抵抗之美名以圖苟安之策。今茲熱河之所謂抵抗者又如何乎。</p>
<p>事實之所昭示於吾人者。以素稱天險難攻之熱河。而敵已長驅直入。今者承德且告失陷矣。而所謂綜握軍符及坐鎭華北者。均猶逍遥遠處。遲遲不赴前敵。若是者可謂爲有戰之决心乎。</p>
<p>熱河前哨戰之開始。猶遠在僞國成立之前。迢迢年餘中。敢問華北守土將吏。是否有充分之準備。如日已有準備。則何以憑險以守。旬日之間。迭失名城。而承德且至不守。此次熱戰爆發以前。洋洋灑灑之文電。仍是掩人耳目之設辭耳。夫抵抗之决心。必求證以抵抗之事實。而抵抗之事實。不能僅憑一紙之宣傳也。疆吏之設。所以守土。失地喪師。何能以抵抗之名。敷衍塞責。今茲之事。責有悠歸。而不能任其專諉罪於湯玉麟及義軍輩也。夫圖苟安者。終必至於誤國。如以苟安爲可久也。則請證以過去之事實。錦州之放棄。原所以求敵人之止戈。榆關之輕防。亦所以求敵人之諒解。然其結果。適中敵人逐步進佔之計。則今之放棄熱河以求平津之苟安者。平津果能永保乎。苟安果能長久乎。</p>

<h3>軍縮會陷僵局</h3>

<p>五强會議又甚囂塵上</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　刻軍縮會議已在停頓之中、靜候美國新總統就任後之有無新副令頒給、美國之代表團際此停頓之中、五强會議之召集現又甚囂塵上、蓋衆覺軍縮會議已　無可進行之地步、非召集五强會議不足以渡過目前難關也、至於五强會議之究竟能否爲事實、亦屬一疑問、因法國方面尙擬加入其協調國家如捷克·南斯拉夫·波蘭·羅馬尼亞等四國、果如此則五强會議勢將擴大成爲九國會議、而法國則將可以操緃一切、指揮如意也、</p>
<p>路透社三日倫敦電　今日内閣舉行會議、由特由日内瓦趕回之外次艾登報告軍縮大會之緊張狀况、結果决定由首相麥唐納及西門外相日内親赴日内瓦一行、在閣議完畢後、據官方發表聲明、謂英政府認爲有極力援助軍縮會議、俾能早日議决辦法之必要云、</p>
<p>路透社三日日内瓦電　日内瓦認英首相與外相之决計來此、乃英國欲提議實際辦法、使軍縮會得以脱出目前劣境之表示、兵士人數比例裁减之問題、今日亦釀成軍縮總委員會之僵局、法代表彭古聲稱、法國在國際保障與安全問題、未更有進步以前、不準備討論兵額問題云、德代表那多尼對於兵額問題之展緩、决定表示大不滿意、那氏引證胡佛總統籲請眞正軍縮之言論、並痛論軍縮會之無能力、雖欲减一兵一砲、或一艦一飛機、亦不可能云、然主席漢德森則聲稱、渠確信不久總可得切實進步云、</p>
<p>國民四日日内瓦電　英首相麥唐納外相西門同來日内瓦之説、甫經宣布、法總理逹拉第復有於下星期内來此之訊、衆皆視此爲五强會議復開已有成功之望、法國似已放棄其原來之異議、因小協約國與波蘭對於法國提交軍縮會議之某種動議、持消極態度、法國深恐陷於完全孤立地位也、因昨日發展之結果、軍缩會議復具生氣、法人方面尤甚、蓋信逹拉第總理將可博得英國之合作、而實行法國計劃也、</p>

<h3>蘇聯農業之機械化（上）蘇聯通信（一月十五日）</h3>
<p>在第一次五年計劃過程中、蘇聯農村裏發生了極大的變動、就是農民大半集體化、惟蘇聯承襲帝俄之遺產、全國經濟生活中、小農經濟佔優勝、生產技術落後、這在客觀上是社會主義經濟體系之莫大的困難、但這莫大的困難、在五年計劃期間、大體上業已完全克服了、</p>
<p>據一九三二年底可靠統計、全聯邦農民百分之六○·五、業已集體化、即一千四百五十萬户農民、業已加入集體農莊播種面積約百分之八○已社會化、即係屬於國營農場和集體農莊所有、但我捫知道、農民集體化是與農業生產機械化分不開、因生產技術不改進、則大規模經營在經濟上是不易维持的、</p>
<h3>農業機器製造業之發展</h3>
<p>在叙述農業機械化前、先説蘇聯農業製造業之發展、在帝俄時代、一九一三年農業機械製造額所謂最高紀録者、其時出品不過共值七千萬盧布、這些製造廠大半（計總數百分之八八·六）是小手工製造廠、隨後歐戰爆發、到一九一五年、出品即比一九一三年降低了兩倍、此後直到一九二○年、仍繼續降低、</p>
<p>在蘇聯時代、其農業機械製造業之發展、可分爲兩期、一爲改造、一爲建設、改造期是在全國經濟恢復時代、即將帝俄舊時所遺下來的大小廠、大半合併改建、比如舊有大小廠計七二二家、現在只合併爲四十個工廠、其出品至一九二六年、已恢復至戰前一九一三年水平、第二期爲第一次五年計劃時代、大這一期間、爲實現全國工業化政策和適應農村集體化之需要、蘇聯政府在五年計劃中、對於農業機械製造業、特别注重、</p>
<p>這由投資上可看出來、在一九二八年時、農業機與曳引機、計佔投資總額百分之一八·五、一九二九年增至百分之二○·二、一九三○年增至百分之二五·二、一九三一年已增至百分之三一·三了、其中所建築的特别有名的農業機製造廠、在曳引機方面、如史逹林格勒曳引機製造廠及喀爾科夫曳引機製造廠、均於一九三一年竣工、每日每廠可出曳引機一百五下架、現在又正在建築一戚拉寳斯基曳引製造廠、預計今年底可完工、規模更大、將來每日可出二百架曳引機、　　在農業機方面、如羅斯特農業機製造廠、於一九三一年一月一日竣工、每年產額約値兩萬盧布、主要出品爲曳引機犂·播種機·收穫用器·耙·及　打複合機等、蕯拉瑪穫打復合機製造廠、於一九三二年竣工、每年出品約値一萬萬三千萬盧布、專製穀物穫打複合機、塔什干農業機製造廠、於一九三二年一月一日完工、每年出品約値五千萬盧布、專製棉業用具、高　農業機製造廠、於一九三一年竣工、每年出品約値兩千七百五十萬盧布、專製刈割牲畜飼料用器、</p>
<p>因農業機製造業已有如斯廣大的發展、則蘇聯農業機械化所需一切機械、均可製造、用不着再由國外輸入了、這即是説减輕了蘇聯對外之依賴、</p>
<p>尤可注意者、蘇聯農業機製造業之發展、不僅可製　般機械、且可製複雜機器、如穫打複合機是、所謂穫打複合機者、就是將收穫穀物和打穗兩作用、聯合於一機而行之、如收小麥、在田野中一方穫一方打、機器前端穫麥、而後邊已是麥粒出來、且　機優點、在收穫中損失穀粒很少、如用手穫時的捆束、運輸等無謂的損失禾粒、均可免去、在一九二八年時、蘇聯農村裹尙不知道有此種東西、一九二九年、方由美國輸入此機四五架、但現在蘇聯已可大量製造此機了、一九三○年初、全蘇聯已有此機八百架、同年終增至一六二○架、一九三一年增至六千架、其中一半係本國所製、一九三二年、已有一萬七千架了、其中只三千六百架係外貨、餘全係蘇聯本國所製的、　　其次、全蘇聯農業機出品、在一九二八丨二九年、共計値兩萬萬一千五百萬盧布、到一九三二年已增至四萬萬盧布、在四年間差不多增了一倍、其中曳引機製造、發展尤速、一九二八年前、蘇聯自造曳引機共計只三千五百架、該年一年計自造一千二百八十架、一九二九年計兩千二百六十七架、一九三○年增至一萬四千二百五十架、一九三一年增至三萬八千零八十三架、一九三二年更增至五萬零二百五十架了、蘇聯農業機器製造業之發展、就可想而知、</p>

<h3>孫科談何應欽飛平</h3>
<p>李烈鈞黄紹雄等同行</p>
<p>何奉中央命主持軍事</p>
<p>立法院長孫科、偕同立法委員傅秉常·吕光·等、前晚十一時二十分、由京乘車抵滬、此來係參加中山文化敎育館籌備委員會最後一次會議、討論各項結束事宜、及關於中山文化館定十二日在京舉行成立典禮時各種應有之準備、各報社記者、昨晨十一時、趨赴哥倫比亞路孫氏寓次訪晤、茲分紀孫氏談話於次、</p>
<h3>三代表辭職原因</h3>
<p>記者首詢以國聯我國三代表辭職之原因何在、孫氏答稱國聯我國三代表曾電京辭職、經中央慰留、現已不成問題、至辭職原因、實係今日我國所處之地位、側重軍事抵抗、外交活動、已比較的尙屬次要、三代表之辭職、即明白表示促醒國内一致决心抗日、萬勿稍存苟安依頼心理、陷國家民族於萬刦不復之地也、</p>
<p>熱河與華北當局　孫氏又稱、關於熱河方面之戰事、就軍械及種種設備而言、我不如敵、就攻守之勢、及地理險要而言、則守易而攻難、故熱河之能守與否問題、完全以北方軍事長官决心如何、及士卒是否用命爲定、</p>
<p>政府當盡量接濟　至中央對於財政餉械接濟問題、當盡量設法籌集、運赴前線、就財政而言、已由財政當局籌付、其他以交通不便、運輸稍感困難、此係以前太不注重國防之結果、致今日有臨時抱佛脚之痛苦也、</p>
<p>何黄李前日飛平　　軍政部長何應欽·内政部長黄紹雄·及中委李烈鈞·三氏、前晨已乘飛機抵平、聞係奉中央命、主持軍事、至是否即往前綫督戰、俟抵平後、再爲决定、至蔣軍事委員長親自北上問題、因中央軍事負責者已往平、蔣暫無北行消息、</p>
<p>勿中日人離間計　記者又詢以熱河前綫董旅降敵消息、孫謂、本人亦殊不能證實此説、聞湯玉麟與董旅長從前意見極深、但深信在此軍事嚴重期間、决不至再存芥蒂至孫殿英投降、及熱湯妥協之説、則純係日人離間政策、愼勿輕信也、</p>
<p>憲法之初步草案　孫氏又稱、開於憲法之起草、立法院憲法起草委員會已規定期間、逐步進行、至初步草案原則、前日會議時已通過、但此係假定原則、將來尙須正式研究、並徵求全國專家之意見云、</p>

<p>美電籌會詢問眞相　籌備委員會主席何炳賢氏、昨接美國芝加哥博覺會特派接洽中國代表愛爾勃博士自美來電、詢問我國停止参加是否確實、及其眞相、請即電復、何氏接電後、當即復稱、中央以國難日亟、决議停止、並無他故、諸希原諒云云、</p>

<h3>劉崇傑昨晨到滬</h3>
<p>謁宋報告華北情形</p>
<p>劉談　吾人無須悲觀惟有犧牲求出路</p>
<p>國聯助我視我之抵抗力量而定</p>
<p>駐日蔣使無外交可辦行將回國</p>
<p>外交部次長劉崇傑、最近由平返京、向羅外長報告華北視察情形後、於昨晨由京到滬、謁見代理行政院長宋子文、下午并至外交部駐滬辦事處、批閲公文、新聲社記者、特往謁晤劉氏、茲分誌其談話如下</p>
<p>北行印象　劉氏首述其來滬任務、謂係謁代理行政院長宋子文氏、對華北情形、作一度報告、至蔣委員長處、亦已將詳細情形電告矣、本人留平近兩月、印象頗佳、然感時局日趨緊張、應加倍努力、求得出路、最近北方形勢、雖無樂觀可言、然亦不必悲觀、祇須努力做去、則終有不辜負前方將士犧牲之結果、</p>
<p>犧牲精神　本人至榆關視察、未赴熱河、深知前方將士、富有犧牲精神、固須知吾人能犧牲、國際上始能收　部份效果、蓋國聯須視吾人本身努力之程度如何、故死守熱河、實爲我國之生死關頭、至前方將士、飢寒困苦、殊非吾輩在南方居住者所可意想、甚望吾人能不負彼等之奮鬥精神也、</p>
<p>蔣使返國　我國出席國聯顏顧郭三代表之辭職、係所以鼓勵政府與前方將士以及全國民衆努力抗敵也、至蔣公使作賓之行將回國、係因蔣氏使日已久、且早有歸國一行之意、故中央准其所請、當此日方積極侵熱之際、蔣使留日、亦無外交可辦也、</p>
<p>禁運軍火　關於英國禁運軍火至</p>
<p>遠東、劉氏表示禁運軍火、不應對侵略者與被侵略者處同一待遇、吾人惟望各國有一公平態度、以促侵略國之覺悟、如侵略者始終不能覺悟、則實爲國聯之存亡所繫、劉氏最後謂、平津治安、除非對方向我進犯、則全部看去、尙非最大之問題、日方謂我破壤辛丑條約、實日佔榆關、即係破壤榆關之舉云云</p>

<h3>梁士詒談抗日救國方案</h3>
<p>金融界今日公宴</p>
<p>申時電訊社本埠消息、前北京政府財政總長梁士詒氏、前日抵滬後即於行裝甫卸之際、發表談話、時促意簡、未能作有系統之詳細談話、申時電訊社記者、特於昨日午後、往梁氏私邸晋謁、當記者抵梁寓時、梁氏適有數友、乃由此次隨同梁氏來滬之岑學吕氏招待入室、談西南風土人情甚歡、未幾客去、乃延入會客室、梁氏衣灰袍黑褂、年逾望六、而精神　鑠、迎記者入、相與握手、稍事寒暄後、記者乃道來意、叩以抗日要旨後方給養等問題、梁氏即表示願作一詳細之談話、詞意所逹、滔滔不絶、談鋒之健、殊足欽佩、</p>
<h3>軍事亦所素習</h3>
<p>據梁氏云、本人此次來滬之任務、亦即全國人民所一致應有之責任、蓋暴日進犯、誰無心肝、孰非國民’覩此時艱、曷勝憤慨、故本人此次來滬、即將轉道北上、参加抗日、至抗日着手之方法、須人人各竭其能、則挽救危亡、庶幾有豸、本人雖非軍人、但對軍事學上、亦稍有研究、清季光緒二十八年時、曾任軍需局長、前保定軍官學校所授之各種書本、大半出自本人手編、邇來軍事器具、雖日新月異、但不同者僅屬於技術上之參差、對於攻守之戰策、地理上之形勢固始終毫無變更也、</p>
<h3>日圖熱防俄美</h3>
<p>日軍旣刦我三省、近又進窺平津、圖我熱河、察其用意、觀其用兵、知彼之所爭、非在一時之得失、而在得後之久守、並預爲對俄對美先攫取堅固險要之根據地蓋日人之攻熱河、分三路進犯、一由九門口、一由凌源、一由開魯、目的在直趨承德、承德爲熱河之省垣、承德淪陷、則全省失矣、今日人雖分三路進犯、但主力軍始終側重於開魯赤峯一路、由此可知日人之戰策之在於持久、在於佔盡地理上之要着、因向榆關或錦州方面廻折而逹開魯、綿互八百餘里、叢山峻嶺、形勢險要、得此可以固守、無患將來日俄戰爭、一方旣可斷絶我軍之援力、同時又可應付俄之戰略、本人所謂日人之目的、在持久佔熱河者此也、民國以還、内戰頻仍、但均以擊破對方之實力爲目標、對地理上之觀念甚鲜、殊不知國與國戰之策略、則非專取險隘、不可以持久也、熱河山脈交錯、唐克車失其效用、大砲亦無從破壞、唯一依賴作戰之利器者、僅屬於飛機而已、故本人深望抗日之利器、以高射砲爲最要也、</p>
<h3>依賴性當剷除</h3>
<p>國難日深、全國朝野、莫不同仇敵愾、回憶台灣基隆之被陷、已三十九年矣、當時情景宛如今日、迨至三十九年之後、誰復倡言收復</p>
<p>耶、段合肥今年爲六十九歲、迨至八十歲時、國難是否平息、則尙屬疑問、或將較今日爲尤烈、亦未可知、今國人對於如此嚴重國難之時期、輙寄希望於日俄或日美之戰爭、姑不論此種未來戰爭、是否有利於我國、而國民暴露此種下劣的依賴性、殊可哀也、本人常聞人言、日俄之形勢如何、日美邦交之惡化、國難如此、猶日盼鄰國之助力、而不知奮起、實行全國總動員、共赴國難、挽救危亡、空言救國、又何裨益耶、當遜濟光緒三十二年、本人曾讀英德兩國之出版物、對於論戰情形、描寫深刻、迨至民三、英德果以開戰聞矣、今日美所出文藝小説、亦何獨非是、由此可知兩國民情之激昂、實已逹於不可遏止之時期、故本人推想世界大戰之必起、但一般人對於世界大戰、無不欣欣然以爲足以制裁暴日、殊不知是否先制日而後滅華、抑先滅華而再制日、實爲舉世之謎耳、</p>
<h3>作戰給養問題</h3>
<p>至日來政府雖具决心抗日、但本人深望政府與人民打成一片、非對前綫抗爭及後方給養、作深密之合作不爲功、日前代理行政院長宋子文氏北上、在平津發行救國庫劵九百萬、以庫劵一千萬作抵、本人對此、殊無其他意見發表、但觀日政府最近對於軍備預算數目之浩大、較之我國僅發行數百萬之公債以與之抗、實屬懸殊過遠、故本人對此意見、可分爲治標與治本之辦法、所謂治本者、則不妨加重捐税、以資補救、但所謂加增捐税、雖一方面於本國工商業或亦不無影響、但抽税儘可以中上資產階級爲標準、例如民國九年、政府即已擬定所得税則、如果實行、則對於普通民衆及糼稚之工商業、當亦可不生問題、至治標辦法、須俟明瞭全國金融狀况之後、始能進而籌商也、梁氏復言在滬擬勾留月餘、即行北上、並否認外傳某某各方曾有電邀請、僅於民衆立塲對救國作切實供獻、至此適有客來訪、記者乃興辭而返、門次遇前鐡道部長葉恭綽氏、據云近全國總動員之説、甚囂塵上、惟國人知此義者尙少、蓋空談救國、國豈可救、願寄語國人、切勿多往外洋冒險、應多到國内各地實地觀察、方知所謂舉國動員、誠屬大不易事、言下慨然、</p>
<h3>金融界之公宴</h3>
<p>昨據可靠方面息、本埠金融界各要人、定於今日假座交通銀行、公宴梁氏、昨報載梁氏、將於今日往訪段祺瑞氏、絶對不確、因梁氏曾表示久居香港見聞較少、須俟多見博聞、對各方情形熟悉後、方行訪段相商云、</p>
<h3>地方協會慰勞孫殿英</h3>
<p>上海市地方協會昨致孫殿英兩電（一）赤峰孫軍長勛鑒、承德相晤獲聞偉論、至深欽仰、旋於途中、遇見貴部、軍容整肅、益信爲精鋭之師、甫抵赤峯、即奏奇勛、聞之痛快、尙祈努力直前、恢復疆土、弟等</p>
<p>願揚威武、力謀後援、特電慰勞、惟希偉鑒、弟穆湘玥黄炎培同叩、支、（一）赤峯孫軍長勛鑒、貴部繞道赴熱、歷盡艱辛、赤峯一役、以少勝多、使敵人狡謀不遂、厥功甚大、捷電傳來、正如陰霾已久、忽然開朗、衆情爲之興奮、尙祈再接再厲、進復失地、敝會誓竭棉力、以爲聲援、特電慰勞、貯聽捷音、上海市地方協會叩、支、</p>

<p>駐華美員將有更動</p>
<p>大陸報云、美政府今日（四日）在華盛頓更迭後、其駐華人員、逆料遲早之間、將有多數易爲民主黨人物、惟領事署人員、則其資格、由於考試、不涉黨派、當不致波及、即駐華公使詹森、亦係專門人材、由資望洊升、縱美國駐外大使與公使、有隨總統進退慣例、但際此遠東風雲緊急之秋、一切須借重熟手、况美國遠東政策、新政府將一仍舊貫、故現有數方面、逆料詹氏、當亦可以蟬聯、惟美國駐華按察使署、則恐在一年之内、將全部改任民主黨人物、即按使潘迪、雖屬共和黨進步派、因明歲十年任期届満後、已逹退休之年、恐亦未必蟬聯、蓋民主黨自威爾遜總統以後、久未柄政、一般黨員、莫不久蟄思動、按署中重要官員如檢事·典獄官·及書記等、恐不久即將更迭也、</p>
<h3>義軍後援會聲明支欵手續</h3>
<p>函律師公會爲李時蕊辨白</p>
<p>上海東北義勇軍後援會、昨函上海律師公會云、逕啟者、前閲二有二十四日時事新報本埠新聞、載有貴會爲李君時蕊案、致國民政府及中央黨部電文、其中有李君侵呑敝會欵項一節、辱荷貴會加以辯白、藉正觀聽、但事關敝會信譽、爰經第五次理事會議决、謹以保管捐欵及支欵手績爲貴會諸公陳之、敝會經募東北義軍捐、向由各公團各報館各銀行担任、其非銀行之收欵機關、亦均以所收捐欵轉存銀行、故捐欵悉數存儲銀行、而由保當委員會負責保管、各銀行之支票簿、即由保管會常任委員林君康候保管、每次支</p>
<p>用接濟費或廣告費時、先由常務理事會塡具請欵憑單、咨送保管委員會、經同意簽出支票後、再經監察委員主任委員潘序倫君之同意、蓋印、然後再由常務理事會、於票上加印、方可匯寄或交付、手續如此嚴緊、故不僅常務理事個人、根本無侵呑捐欵之可能、即整個常務理事會、希圖濫用捐欵、亦爲事實上絶對所不許、二十一年度收支總報告、業經登報公佈、項目清明、毫無隠秘、侵呑之説、不知來自何處、以損害個人名譽、而圖破壞救國運動、實深婉惜、方今大敵當前、豈容自相猜忌、事實勝於雄辯、日後方見人心、用特叙述梗概、還祈察照爲感、此致上海律師公會、</p>

<h3>再論自殺　望月君來訊</h3>
<p>先生··你的答復實在不能使我完全滿意，現在給先生答復的三點·分析開來，再討論一下·不過要辯護自殺，贊成自殺的話，説得再有理由些，也不能得到你的一點同情的，並且是極端的反對··這是我在未問之先、深深地曉得的，因爲你是個有爲的學者、進取的革命者，當然不同情於弱者的。（一）因爲身體不健康而衰弱極了的人自殺，先生説··「就使是他瞎子，聾子，跛子，都有他的工作效能，都有盡力於社會的機會·」這話未必完全是對的··要曉得在如今這畸形的社會中，有健全身體思想的人，都難找到一點事做，而這樣的所謂「殘廢」人，就能夠個個有事做嗎？他們不願意没事做而討飯吃，過消費生活，他們這種自殺，我承認在社會上無足重輕的哇哩！（二）過奴隷生活而眞衝破不開的人自殺，我講個事實給你聽··「我們這小城市裹，有一間人家四個人，父毋同兩個兒子，大兒子在去年娶了個女人，這女人自從同她丈夫結婚後，日日打駡，眞所謂「一日三頓打，三日九頓敲·」丈夫婆婆兩個人打，這女人受不了，首先哀求，他們不聽，以後她也反抗過種種，如逃走啦，同丈夫拚命啦，結果一樣都不行。逃走吧，追回來還是打，尤其利害。同丈夫拚命吧，婆婆同丈夫捆起來痛打。這女人娘家又没有親生人，祇有個父親，這父親又可憐而且也不問你女人的姓，這婆家是世襲的惡狠之家，她無路走，祇好自殺了，免得受罪。」先生··這無能的女人，怎樣地反抗？怎樣地衝破呢？最後，請先生不要眞信有天堂地獄之説，她到陰問還要做小膽鬼哩！（三）「感到處處是苦悶，人世間是空虚的没有同情人的窮</p>
<p>人······」先生答函中劈頭就説··「你以爲怎樣才不苦悶呢？駟馬高車？豐衣足食？嬌妻美妾？你以爲怎樣才不空虚呢？做官做到主席？發財發到哈同？一唉！先生這話又錯了·感到處</p>
<p>處是苦悶的神經過敏的人，不是快樂幸福而就不苦悶，感到人世間是空虚的人，也决不是做官發財而就不空虚的。老實説，就是天下財給他一個人發了，世界大王給他做了，苦悶他還是要苦悶，空虚他還是要空虚的哩！至於你先生又説··「你以爲你是怎樣一個了不得的人，爲什麽應該同情於你呢？你的文學有偉大的創作嗎？你有什麽發明嗎？······」這話説得更使我莫明其妙了，你的同情人，全是一些偉大的創作家嗎？全是一些發明家嗎？爲的要人家同情，就要有偉的大創作同什麽發明嗎？窮人有窮人的同情，富人有富人的同情，革命家有革</p>
<p>命家的同情，各有各的同情·照先行這樣講中國不是没有什麽同情的嗎？丨試問，國内有幾個發明家？幾個偉大的創作家呢？世間上的人，値得留戀的人，就是有這麽一點同情心，不然的話，世界没有進步，恐怕還要滅亡哪！先生以爲如何？幸有以敎之！</p>
<p>答··來書再讑自殺問題，極所歡迎，惟是前兩條立論·仍不外乎自殺者不得已，我們應當承認他們的自殺是對</p>
<p>的，而足下的自殺觀也就因此成立。實則你我對於自殺的態度根本不同就在此，足下只從自殺者的不得已，或是爲環境所迫，無力奮鬥出發。老實説，這種自殺，我們當然也要對之揮灑一掬同情之涙，然而社會逼人自殺的黑暗勢力是你我自殺可以推倒的，或則可以用自殺喚起惡勢力對我們的憐憫麽？三尺童子也知道是不可能的。那麽，你這種自殺觀不是直接地鼓勵人自殺，（實則自殺就是對於惡勢力的屈服。）間接就是替惡勢力減少思想上的反抗與行動上的反抗嗎？而且你的自殺觀的根源完全是個人主義的餘毒在作怪。若果我們的一舉一動，一言一行不建築在··横説是全世界的人類，至少是最大多數的人類··賢説是過去未來與現在的最大多數的人類，的　戚利害上面，那你自然得不</p>
<p>到安身立命的地方，一遇環境的困難，便要消極，消極的念頭發展到一定程度便要自殺。若果照你的自殺觀演譯下去，則人類的一部鬥爭史便不會有，而法國大革命，美國的獨立戰爭</p>
<p>，俄國大革命也不會發生，直到如今還是封建貴族的專　社會與奴隷狀態中末由自拔。那時，恐怕你我這樣從從容容在報上研究自殺問題的機會都還没有。我們人類的許多祖先幾經奮鬥給我們爭得今日之若干社會幸福，而我們一遇困難，便爾自殺，祖宗地下有知，當大呼日··不肖的兒孫，没出息！你所説的那無能的女人被家庭環逼而自殺，固然是一種事實，但是足下所謂自殺觀，就是建築在這種自殺上面的嗎？而足下也甘居於這種女人之無知無識而委棄對於社會人　的責任嗎？果然，我要唐突一句··「女安則爲之丨」我們的字典上自始就没有「天堂地獄」這個名詞，前次覆足下信中所云，只是一種假設之詞，並非眞信有如斯之一境，前後脈絡，一目瞭然，足下以見得我們是有鬼論者丨可以説是「前言戲之耳丨」至於第三條，我們也有我們的理由。中國實在有一種名士派，或則可以説頽廢派，做起詩來，總是一唱三歎，欷嘘流涕··做起文來，總是怨天尤人，意在</p>
<p>言外，就是我有濟世救民，安邦定國的良才，而世不我用，遂爾意興索然，髣髴天下之大，竟無我容身之地似的。這種人總覺得社會對不起他，社會不認識他，不與他以相當的待遇與相當的同情，平心而論，社會實有一部人對他要負責任，然而大部分被壓迫的社會方仰望着有力量願爲之奮鬥的志士出而與惡勢力相抗拒，而遽因不敵惡勢力的奛迫，便萌自殺念頭，那末，社會又何必對你表示同情呢？而且你説··「因爲我環境窮困，而又帶了點壯志雄心，不會交際，拍馬庇的交際···」以此來做爲你自殺的理由，這不是明明白白怪社會上或則説政</p>
<p>府裏，或則什麽機關處没有眼睛認識</p>
<p>你這「帶了點壯志雄心」的「大才」嗎？我又要説笑話了··可惜當世没有周文</p>
<p>王，不然那你到渭濱垂釣，一定可以作王者之師··」又可惜當世没有劉玄德，又没有徐元直的推薦，不然，那一定有人卑詞厚禮，「三顧草廬丨」先生丨這是無聊的妄想丨落伍的思想丨一個人不以一身去爲社會奮鬥，不預先拿定主意，是要到處碰壁的。我們就拿孫中山先生做比罷。現在人人都知道「總理長，總理短」了丨現在人人都奉若神明了，然而他們只看見今日功成身死的孫先生，他們却没看見亡命日本，被囚英倫，觀音山被圍時的孫先生，孫先生，在當時從未有一點頽喪的神氣。越是身上担得起担子的人，越是不責備人家什麽同情不同情，所謂「道高一尺，魔高一丈，」我們雖不相信宗敎，然而一個爲羣衆奮鬥的英雄，他時時刻刻是背着十字架前進的。若果一事没做，而遽怪人家對</p>
<p>你没有同情，老實説，那實説，那實在有限丨我要請問··足下所謂壯志，究竟是怎樣地「壯」法？所謂雄心，究竟是怎樣地「雄」法？願聞明敎。看了我們上面的解释，可以明白我們上次所説的「你以爲怎樣才不苦悶呢？···發財發到哈同？」一段話，不是無的放矢了··而「你以爲你是怎樣了不得的人··有什麽發明嗎？」一段話也不是無根之言了。我還告訴你··世間上的人是有同情心的，但希望你的眼睛換一個方向看看！</p>

<h3>市敎育局昨日第三次播音演講</h3>
<p>由潘局長公展播講</p>
<p>敎育及國家與民族</p>
<p>市敎育局、自本月份起、舉辦無缐電播音以來、一日由該局潘局長公展演講、二日由陳科長白演講、均在中西藥房電台舉行、昨（四日）下午四時、該局復假大中華公司電台、由潘局長播講敎</p>
<p>育節目、題爲「敎育及國家與民族」、旁旁微博引、極爲群盡、聞該局對於是項播音演講、極爲重視、除由第四科指定專員負責主持外、並極願各界人士於收聽之後供獻意見、以資參考、概可與該科直接通訊云、</p>
<h3>潘公展演講詞</h3>
<p>（一）今天和諸位談敎育與國家及民族、因爲國家之與裏、民族之存亡、實與敎育之良應有甚密切的關係、有良好的敎育方能造就良好的國民、有</p>
<p>了良好的國民方能組成强盛的國家、而其結成的民族也必緣之而發榮滋長、反之如敎育　敗、民性堕落、則社會必因之而散漫、國家必因之而</p>
<p>衰弱、民族的生存、也自然發生問題、要明了此裏邊的道理就要知道什麽是敎育、什麽是國家、</p>
<p>什麽是民族　、然後看看敎育對於國家及民族到底有什麽關係、　　什麽是敎育呢、要用幾句話來滿意地解答這個問題、是不可能的、廣義的説、敎育就是成熟的人、謀發逹未成熟的人的身心、以作將來社會生活的準備而傳逹前代文化的事業、這裏、我們可经看出敎育活動、含有施敎育者與被敎育者兩方面、敎育的使命在謀被敎育者的身心能夠健全的發展、以適應社會生活、而綿延民族的文化</p>
<p>（二）那麽、什麽是國家呢、對於國家各派有各派的觀念（這是政治學上的中心問題、我們這裏不必細説也不能細説）有的拿國家看做包括一切特别團體的全體社會、國家的搆成員丨丨人民丨丨對於國家祇有服從的義務、把國家看成一個偶像、有的以「自由」做根據、把國家看做保護人類自由的機關、對内防止個人間相互的侵害、對外防止外敵的侵害、國家自已並没有目的、祇是</p>
<p>保護個人自由的方法、有的把國家看做統治阶級支配被統治阶級的工具、還有的以國家是有</p>
<p>一　或數　　能和其餘社會　等、不是在一切社會之上、祇是和其　社會平行的一個社會、以</p>
<p>上　説中、把國家看做體社會、以國家本身爲</p>
<p>目的固然是不對、拿國家看做　　壓迫的組織、也是倒果爲因非常　　的、不過國家的確是一種工具、是人類爲逹到公共的特殊目的而合意組成的有一定職能的、有一定界限的、地域團體、至於所謂民族就是指那些帶有血統、言語·宗敎、生活·風俗習慣的關係的若干人民、世界上有些國家是由幾個民族合組而成的、也有一個民族分組成幾個國家的、敎育、國家·民族的间思已經講過了、我們現在來研究一下、敎育與國家及民族的關係、</p>
<p>（三）國家旣是爲要逹到公共的特殊目的的團體、而公共的特殊目的中再没有比安寗和幸福的保障與增進更大的了、國家旣有一定的職能、保障和增進人民的安寗與幸福當然是職能之内的了、由前面所説、我們可知敎育的功能在於發展身心、而傳逹前代文化、故國家欲完成其使命、實施其職能均不能不有頼於敎育、所以敎育是國家及民族的命脈、一個國家要富强、一個民族要興盛、人民要有幸福、都要這　國家的敎育能够则效、我們中國現在可算是糟到極點的了、這個結果是從那裏來的呢、就是因爲過去幾十年的敎育辦得没有成效、敎育辦得没有成效、所以人民没有好的知能、缺乏善的品性、而眞正的信仰、也不能確定、目前的情形、旣如此、敎育與國家及民族的關係的密切又如彼、我們想逹到以敎育來救國的目的、惟有細察時弊、澈底改進、敎育者的本身應當先有覺司、修身立範依據三民主義敎育的原則、獻身敎育事業、爲敎育事業而努力奮鬥社會人士也應當憬悟於敎育意義的重大、而盡力帮助政府去完成這個偉大的使命、而後我們國家、我們民族的前途方有希望、</p>

<h3>萬國籃球第一幕</h3>
<p>中華女子戰勝美國</p>
<p>結果四十四比二十九</p>
<p>英國女子戰勝聯邦三八比三十</p>
<p>男子初賽菲律濱棄權</p>
<p>本届上海萬國籃球、於昨晚在勞神父路中華籃球房開幕、打泡戲爲女子組英國對聯邦、兩隊竸爭、極爲可觀、結果英隊以三十八比三十勝、第二塲中華女子隊對美國、中華隊有出於意外之美妙表演、是以美國球藝雖精、不得不甘拜下風、第三塲菲律賓因手續上延誤、致昨晚未能出塲、自認棄權、實美中不足、參觀者約有七八百人、在此春雨連綿之夜、不易有之盛况也、茲紀經過如下、</p>
<h3>英國勝聯邦三八比三十</h3>
<p>打泡戲爲女子組英國對聯邦、兩隊實力均强、英隊係划船綠隊爲主體、傅遞投射、均有可觀、聯邦則由葡萄牙猶太及俄爾斯等女將合組、如瑪蒂、如傑漢生、均一時首選、惜人才不若英除之平均、結果聯邦以三十比三十八敗北、表演則均甚出色、</p>
<p>上半時　開始接觸、形勢頗爲平均、英隊以十比七佔優於第一節、聯邦奮勇對抗、傑漢生瑪蒂、時有建樹、英隊雖强、不覺爲之減色、曾成十四比十四、十六比十六、兩次平手、惟從此英隊又復轉盛、潑林斯大爲奮發、以二十比十六勝上半時、</p>
<p>下半時　此後英隊一路領先、聯邦雖繼續努力、力圖報復、無奈對方解備嚴密、不能暢所欲爲、分庭抗禮、彼此動作清爽、傳遞迅速、局勢頗富與趣、總結果英國以三十八比三十勝、</p>

<h3>中華克美國　四四比二九</h3>
<p>中華之美國、全在第一及第四兩節中、至於第二</p>
<p>第三節中、美隊大施威迫、曾一度成二十五之平手、兩隊竸爭均有可觀、以昨晚中華女將之奮鬥精神觀之、或可有擊敗英國奪得錦標之希望、前鋒擲籃頗準、傅遞亦有可取、惜楊森時有自私自利之弊、後衛當以王志新最佳、黄淑華亦甚稳健、總之、全隊工作、已臻妙境、</p>
<h3>一鼓作氣</h3>
<p>裁判員舒鴻下令動員、兩方開始接觸、楊森與白乃特、彼此</p>
<p>互失一機、美國包圍籃下、左右開弓、卒由白乃特首開紀錄、爲時無幾、楊森還中、陳聚才連加二只、從此中華隊氣燄萬丈、得心應手、無往不利、美隊防不勝防、一籌莫展、第一節終了、中華共得十六分、美國僅二分耳、</p>
<h3>漸形緊張</h3>
<p>第二節起、美國大爲努力、形勢漸見緊張、美女將先得五分、中華還中二只、以後之局勢、美隊頗優勢、後方防衛工作、亦覺周密、前锋白乃特最爲驍勇、瑪許鮑州許二女士、彼皮頗能合作、是節比數、相差一半、美隊以十二比六勝、但上半時之總比數、中華仍以二十二比十四佔優、</p>
<h3>美國追上</h3>
<p>再戰聲起、美選手、大發雌威、分數節節增国加、扶搖直上、周旋不久、中華僅以三分佔前、比數成二十三比二十、形勢殊覺危險、往後又成二十五比二十三、當此時觀衆呐喊大起、焦急萬份、而碧眼黄毛、更覺得意洋洋、喜形於色、待第三節終了、總數爲二十五比二十四、美國僅以一分落後、</p>
<h3>最後威風</h3>
<p>查三節中、中華所以大負而能被美國追上者、實因後衛王志新之出塲、故自第四節起、亟調王入、但忽忙間未報告紀錄員、因而受罰一球、被美國造成二十五之平等比數、斯時之中華隊、忽如暴雨之後、重覩天日、不覺精神大振氣熖突旺、衝鋒陷陣、勢如破竹、楊森一中再中、連獲多球、如靑雲直上、反觀美隊、一厥不振、攻守見拙、在此一節中、中華共得十九分之多、於是中華遂得最後勝利比數爲四十四比二十九、</p>

<p>萬國足球杯</p>
<h3>一九三二丨三三蘇格蘭獲得錦標</h3>
<p>昨敗英格蘭比數四對三</p>
<p>全隊合作佳妙技能超衆</p>
<p>上海西聯足球會萬國杯、昨日下午三時在逸園舉行决賽、細雨斜風中、蘇格蘭以四對三戰勝英格蘭、獲得一九三二至三三錦標賽畢、由協進會董事趙晋卿給獎、</p>
<h3>蘇格蘭名實相符</h3>
<p>蘇格蘭以阿迦爾爲體、加以西捕好手而成、於中華一役中、顯然呈强有力之軍容、中華旣敗、惟存英格蘭、英固强大、昨終於三對四比賽之下、敗於蘇格蘭者、其故有二、全隊陣線支配、均久於其位、合作乃出之自然、一也、球員技能超衆、内外人才俱全、二也、但彼時英格蘭處於上半時勢盛之下、設加以幸運之助、多有所獲、則結果猶當别論、</p>
<h3>中華隊不堪回首</h3>
<p>中華隊於過去之二年度中、連握霸權、迨至本届、羣雄會集、錦標呼聲甚高、轉戰至複賽、乃逢蘇格蘭、其時在原有精鋭之陣線外、又新來之華南名將數人、大有氣呑山河之慨、惜以支配失人、陣勞散漫、痛遭淘汰之禍、回首前塵、曷勝懊傷、</p>
<h3>萬國杯歷届得主</h3>
<p>上海自有萬國杯以來、至今已有十六次、一九一二年開始、歐戰及去年滬戰時、均曾停止、歷届錦標要以英格蘭次數最多、計八次、其次蘇格蘭四次、中華二次、愛爾蘭葡萄牙各一次、列表如左、</p>
<p>一九一二丨一三······愛爾蘭</p>
<p>一九一三至一五······英格蘭</p>
<p>一九一九至二三······英格蘭</p>
<p>一九二四至二六······蘇格蘭</p>
<p>一九二八丨二九······葡萄牙</p>
<p>一九二九至三○······中華隊</p>
<p>一九三二丨三三······蘇格蘭</p>
<h3>本届羣雄逐鹿表</h3>
<h3>蘇英兩軍大戰紀</h3>
<p>驚喜各半</p>
<p>細雨斜風之下、作戰九十分鐘、大爲苦事、加以塲地泥　、行軍不便、球吸水量、重加有半、各個表演、不免减色、雙方情緒、異常緊張、蘇格蘭逆風　戰、一鼓作氣、休士左邊殺入、軋許返兵救駕、球中其　、被罰十二碼、透納不勞而獲、正中綱内、蘇隊勝來一球、爲時三分鐘、中央開球、軋許遙傳右翼、迎向中央、轉眼之際、　特萊乘隙射出、蘇門亦告失陷、五分鐘内、互獲一球、驚喜各半、</p>
<p>出人意外</p>
<p>英軍占勢、德飛直人、　以肉搏、漢特萊　中突出、再度破關、英軍反以二對一居先、其時蘇軍内部欠强健、外鋒又不利、獨見英軍活躍非常、顧幸運尙未順通、每苦遇門不入、蘇軍偶然反撲、左傳右選、麥太維許　關　旗而返、打成各二局面、將近終局、蘇軍休士又孤軍獨入、二十碼間、猛然射出、守門扑地出臂擋之、竟自手指中瀉入、上半時蘇軍反以三對二占先、</p>
<p>優者終勝</p>
<p>下半時、蘇軍大有起色、全隊生龍活虎、長駐英地、環攻不已、時出意外、不十分鐘、英軍德飛得右翼之助、進窺敵門、一鼓而下、造成三對三和數、比數同而境狀異、蘇隊合作巧妙、控制全局、麥太维許再中一球、成四對三、蘇軍遂凱旋而返、</p>
<p>給獎情形</p>
<p>比賽旣終、二隊健兒、會集一處、由會長葛萊姆餳致勉勵嗣、中華全國體育協進會董事趙晋卿演説、祝賀蘇隊成功、並給獎禮、協進會名譽主韓沈嗣良亦參與盛會、此次重要比賽、裁判乃我華人何春輝擔任、處置公道、允稱勝任、</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>上海小話</h3>
<p>— 梯公</p>
<p>誰要不信，「人不如狗」的話，請他上所謂「地皮大」王的洋房子裏的</p>
<p>狗公館外面張一張，我擔保他始也歡喜贊嘆，　也惘惘然如有所失。</p>
<p>這是洋房子裏的人説的··「大王家嗜狗成群，坐上狗常滿，盤中肉不空。大大小小，養起百多條中西名狗。不提别的，單是喂狗用的狗餅干一項，每年從外國定購，已經要化到幾千塊大洋　」。　　大王的狗，當然有「人不如」的技巧。據説「每早工廠放汽上工，嗚的一聲，多條狗也同時放汽。不過大王的洋房子，並非工業區，所以四周的洋大人，便聯名送哀的美敎書，禁止放汽。大五的回復是，　洋大人三個月内一律搬家，原來這都是大王的產業，可憐最愛清靜的洋大人，也只好掩旗息鼓，恭德放汽」。</p>
<p>我想洋大人自有「抗議」以來，應以這件答復最爲痛快。然而，大房東這種氣燄，到底還是要不得的。所以我們政府雖然没有房租收，終還是客客氣氣敷衍着洋大人的面子。</p>
<h3>春秋上載的一回故事</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>我昨天翻報，看了東北義勇軍後援會，拍出「請蔣委員長北上督師」的電文，頓時使得久不投稿的在下，也有些技癢難過，不得不來胡謅幾句。</p>
<p>記得從前十三四歲的時候，讀了「禮記一部，又接着讀了「尙書」，眞覺得頭昏腦脹，到底中間講些什麽？現在想起來，還是莫明其妙。其實這種書，倘若那時候，没有讀過，也是錯過了機會，後來老師把「春秋」來講讀，就稍稍覺得書中有些興味了。</p>
<p>有一天，像記得在甲午中日的戰役，當鴨綠江敗績，高陞輪沉没的時候吧，讀到「趙簡子自將兵攻衛，及戰，且遠立，自蔽屏櫓之下，鼓之而士不起，簡子投桴而嘆曰··士之弊，一若此乎！行人燭過，免胄而進曰··亦有君不能耳，士何弊之有？昔我先君獻公，即位五年，兼國七十，用此士也。惠公暴慢，秦人來侵，去絳十七里，用此士也。文公底之以勇，三年而士盡果敢，五敗荆人，成名於天下，用此士也。亦有君不能耳。士何弊之有？簡子乃去屏櫓，而立於矢石之所及，一鼓而士畢乘之」。這一段歷史，是春秋上所載的，讀了，自然覺得眉飛色舞，而痛恨當時的將領，不得其人，雖是懦夫，也要提起百廿分的勇氣去殺敵致果了。　　所以我看了東北義勇軍後援會的電文，有「非有我公親自北上督師，統馭指揮，不足以壯前方之士氣，挽救危亡之大勢」。這幾句話，眞是沈涌。因爲東北的淪陷。表面上暴日像唾手而得，實則我遼瀋的民衆，一年以來，無時無日，都在血窟裏和倭奴相搏擊，不斷的拿生命抵抗，倘若早有主將站在前線，豈不是像有了戚繼光做大將，那末義烏的一兵一卒，也就要名聞世界，稱他無敵麽？唉丨因爲這一來，吾要希望像春秋時候的趙簡子，不蔽在屏櫓之下，而快快劍及履及的上馬殺賊前去，也就爲現在手中握有兵柄的負責當局，進獻一詞</p>
<h3>思想萬能</h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>雙手萬能，是勉勵人家勸勉的一句話，意思是説一個人生了雙手，勤勤懇懇的做，總不會餓死的。説得再深刻些，有了一雙手，總會把東西塞到三十六個牙齒中間，而不餓死了。但是這名話，現在已給我打倒了。因爲我曾見一個没有雙手的乞丐，他也會討了東西，用脚喂到嘴裏去维持生命。這倒還不足爲奇。新近我們近旁有一個路倒屍，巡捕把他車進騐屍所檢騐之後，據説是餓死的。可是這一個屍首，非但二手生得很完全，就是二手上，也不多不少的生着十個指。從此可知一個人儘生着雙手，至多也不過能做九千九百九十九事，萬能裏還缺一個维持生活的本領。四足着地的畜生，一世未曾生過一隻手，却不見得生下地就没了命。</p>
<p>雙手萬能這句金口玉言，旣不能成立，那麽，究竟甚麽是萬能呢？我説，惟有思想，纔是萬能。發明了一個主義，要人如何便如何。發明了一件科學上的東西，萬能博士也要敬謝不敏，自愧弗如。不拘上中下三等人，有思想的，總佔便宜。主義家·科學家·不用説了。就是做生意，也要有思想，纔翻得出新花樣兒，受人歡迎。再説，明明是侵略，偏説是武裝和平。假使没有思想，豈非就逃不了侵略的惡名？綁票那名兒何等剌耳，於是有思想的人們，便美其名曰請財神。花了錢做財神。圖名不圖利，富翁們何樂而不爲。世上儘有生了好好二手而餓死的。有思想的人，斷不會餓死。所以我説萬能那把交椅，該讓給思想先生坐。</p>
<h3>在小廣寒中</h3>
<p>— 浦迭修</p>
<p>都市，美麗的都市，紅，黄，白，紫··各個顏色都有，陶醉在這裏的人們，就整日夜的那麽地游蕩着。忘記了一切，抛却了一切。雖然，祖國形勢是這般的不佳，熱河一帶的戰事，已經猛烈的關始，究屬路遠，儘管消遙。反正一二八淞滬一役，機砲聲雖不絶示威。但，某一部份，還不是興高彩烈的那樣作樂嗎？</p>
<p>因此，後援會的捐欵儘管無人問津，星期假日，其實平常也是這樣，電影院游藝塲，始終能拉上了鐵門，掛起客滿牌。四馬路畔的小廣寒，也天天如此，月月如此。</p>
<p>這裏，是名花會串的塲所，伊們雖一例像梅博士那般靠唱戲拿錢。但，多或少，肉的誘，色的惑，以及媚眼，綣髪，　腰，血唇，都是這一批「娛樂不忘國難」的游客們的媒介，在那兒，他們是嘻笑，優游，快活。無疑的，腦海裏是没什麽國難的印像。</p>
<p>「揮霍」，是都市裏人們的慣例，所以，一元二角代價的點戲，一齣又一齣的輪流不斷，王姓，張姓，李姓，以及什麽Ｓ君，ＡＢＣ君···最可笑，有一位用上了「商女」作名字的，實在，眞是個明白的大國民啊！形態是得意得很，抽着烟，喝着香茗，聽着唱京調，同時，還大聲疾呼的呌着彩。</p>
<p>一忽兒，呌喊着號外的報販們，拿着那當時出版的報兒來販賣了。雖標題已用上了頭號的鉛字，顯明的現出局勎已非常緊張。但它的誘惑，終不及在臺上的肉體們，價格雖只有三四十文的一張，不是説句刁刻話，買的人。還夠不到百之四五。於是，我明白，充分地明白，這嚴重的國難，是抵不過幾具肉體架。三四十文一張的號外，也拚不過一元二角一齣點戲的代價。雖説都市人是揮霍成性的。　　我在朋友處聽到上面一段的談話，我，哭不出笑的我，除去了歎氣，毫無辦法。</p>
<p>長篇小説</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第一回</p>
<p>推食殷勤偏邀貧女憶</p>
<p>入門慷慨别具武夫雄</p>
<p>伊隔了一個破藍布門簾子，對母親如此説着。江氏在裏面答道··是的，對門甘家人放的屁，你都會説是香的，甘二爺説的話那就更不用提了。老姑娘隔了門廉，帶了微笑，嘴向裏屋一撇，却裝出發狠的聲音道··你這是什麽話，説出來也不管人家受得了受不了。人家説的原是對的嗎，我還有什麽話説呢？你要不怕煤薰，你就搬爐子到屋子裏去添火。我還想活着看看花花世界啦。我到隔壁王家串門子去。江氏道··别去了，王家兩口子正絆嘴呢，你就把爐子在外面添火罷。母女兩人正自隔室喧嚷，便有人由外院走了進來，一路問道··老姑娘，你媽在家嗎？江氏答道··説甘二爺，甘二爺就來了，我在家啦。那甘二爺穿了一件灰色線春的羊皮袍子，脇下夾了一包東西，走到外面屋子，見老姑娘在屋子當中，對了爐子，只是發楞，便笑向伊道··外面屋子怪冷的，爲什麽在這裏站着呢？老姑娘笑道，不是二爺説了嗎？在屋子裏頭添煤，會薰着人的，我們在外邊屋子添煤啦。江氏在屋子裏插言道··二爺，您瞧，我們老姑娘，眞是肯聽你的話。外面凉，請進來坐罷。甘二爺聽説，就夾了那個包袱，走到裏面屋子裏來。江氏接過包袱，顚了兩顚，笑道··二爺又有什麽話兒，照顧我們。他答道··你瞧，我這件皮袍子，面子都快要　了，我要趕快做一件罩袍把它罩上。江氏笑道··做是可以做的，就是没有裁縫做得合身材。甘二爺笑道··一件藍布大褂，還那樣過講究作什麽？衣服我是要作的，工錢也是要出的，有給裁縫的工錢，拿給你們，還算帮了你們的忙，這不是一舉兩得的事情嗎？老姑娘笑道··二爺總是這樣好心腸，其實女工活是女工活，裁縫活是裁縫活，那可不一樣。江氏笑道··二爺坐着，讓我作點水···甘二爺連忙攔着道··我一天不定來多少回，來了你們就這樣客氣，以後我就不好意思來了。（二）</p>

<h3>美新棉田增百分之八·九</h3>
<p>紐約三日來電報告一週中之棉市云、上週棉市以銀行風潮法制問題之未能確定、致交易因以鋭減、惟南方賣出極少、實際地位較穏、多頭了結、亦形缺乏、故潛勢仍屬稳定、一般人於胡佛總統對司蜜斯氏减少棉產之提議案、是否嘉納、頗致懹疑、棉貨交易亦屬有限、據散播之消息、稱棉頃方計畫、將本季原棉成本減至最低可能之度、泥土情形良好果　　伏亦減、開　氣象極佳、據番却爾局估計、水季播種析田爲阻零、九二六、零零零英赦、較上季增百分之八·九</p>
<p>云、</p>
<h3>糧食米市客求急脱小角許</h3>
<p>（河南）昨船户罷運、雖經多方較斛等情、然一時尙未解决、到滬來源仍無、僅寥寥之浦中船存及棧貨廠貨交易、但去胃呆滯、客方都頗急脱、市價减小角許、廠貨尙能挺立、裕康棧之北　以廣包計算、售價九元五角五分云、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下來源祇有小港來滬三四號、白粳直化不暢、市形小去一角左右、薄粳平正、早稻疲勢、羊尖帶軟、杜尖客尖定格、陰元白元無甚上落、</p>
<h3>清而堅的粉市</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份曾見良好之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥驟漲五六角、坎拿大漲二角左右、故開價時、人心殊佳、較前日收價、計爲一分左右、惟買户仍不甚旺、且有浮多回出、故至收盤、回去七厘半左右、迨至下午開盤、初仍平平、惟至二盤後、因津帮態度、已轉稳定、對於期貨、已少回出、卽現货去路、亦轉略暢、因此各盤交易、雖依然清淡、市氣則步見良好、結果本月份較前日漲一分、四月份漲一分半、五月份漲一分、六月份漲一分半、七月份漲一分七厘半、八月份漲二分、</p>
<h3>絶感寥落的麥市</h3>
<p>麥市上下午開盤後、各月份市面、依然清淡如常、雙方意興、一無生氣、惟本月份因洋麥報漲、人心帶緊、上午開至三兩二錢、計爲四分、下午交易仍少、回落一分、遠期各月份、祇七月份交易尙旺、餘多空拍、結果本月份較前日漲三分、七月份漲二分、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖市劃盤疲滯逾恒</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以標金　跌不已、而今日又値星期日無裝出、趨勢疲弱逾恒、公會劃整組砂白普通貨雖呌十五兩三錢半原盤、竟全有出無進、惟高貨ＡＲ總以貨缺仍要十五兩六兩、二十號中砂的以及八九荷　赤均呌原盤、全無成交、號盤亦乏開出云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金山扁枝步漲不已</h3>
<p>金山扁枝近以銷路發動、來源軋缺、供不應求、故市價爲之步漲、昨聞號方又開出一批、比前又升三四兩、市勞　形緊俏、有續升之象、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油跌價始開二千餘件</h3>
<p>油市看疲已久、　持多日、仍未有昭蘇之象、然硬　亦非久常之計、故昨日始協議售開、市價已足跌六錢、而去路依然平常、經情商後、先行陸續出用、價格將憑售開大市作實、致昨市成交二千中百件、但市面雖以甩開、後情尙恐難以看好云、</p>
<h3>五金大條鉛又跌一錢</h3>
<p>大條鉛昨又跌一錢、如洋鉛每担估十一兩七錢半、土鉛十一兩六、交易茶帮雖有添辦、爲數不多、蓋距離新茶登塲期尙遠、津帮抱説望不買、所以成交益鮮、而土鉛到貨較旺、洋鉛存積亦富、市氣因之難振、美匯增長、人心難好、標準一時恐難見轉機也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　皖白絲運滬五十八件</h3>
<p>皖省木鎭靑陽等處所產之反車等白絲、盛銷印法等莊、而產額不旺、來源寥落、昨晨長江班　好輪進口、由大通裝到皖白絲五十八件、存棧</p>

<h3>請批評家們注意</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>彷彿是在兩年前，有好幾天報纸上用大字登出一段記事這樣講，有五個小學校的學生，小則十一二歲，大則十五六歲，因爲平日喜歡讀武俠小説之類的東西，中了迷，相約</p>
<p>要到蛾眉山上去修道，於是各把家裏給的學費暗中藏起，定好一城就上了船，但因爲一個最年幼的孩子，一時軟弱，放聲哭起來，事情就被發現，孩子們被大人領回家去了。這事是在上海發生的，其後不久我到了香港，有一天在香港的報紙上，看見了與此極相彷佛的事件，武俠小説對於中國兒童有如此驚人的魅力，眞是我們不易想到的，其實不只兒童，在中國還有着無數萬的成人，其思想與知識是可以和兒童們放在同一的水準上的，武俠小説對於這些成人像對於兒童們似地，是有着同樣可驚产魅力。　　不管文學界的「藝術至上主義者」怎樣輕蔑這種武俠小説之類的東西，不肯承認它們也是文</p>
<p>學的部類之一，但它們對於兒童以及兒童似的愚民，正如同最高的藝術品對於受過高等敎育的男女一樣。而且在今天，它們的影響力也還是勝過一切的新文藝的產品的。　　一個民族的大多數的羣衆，縱愚玩到怎樣的程度，也總有他們的讀物，而那些讀物也總是支配着他們的生活與思想，造成他們的人生觀或宇宙觀。一度受了那些惡劣讀物的壤影響的羣衆，就好像被蜘蛛捕獲了的小虫一樣，雖費九牛二虎这力，也難以救得出來。我國的民衆讀物是惡劣得不可再惡劣，而它的勢力又是大得無可再大，喪命在這個蜘蛛網的羣衆，就在今天，也不曉得有幾千萬或幾萬萬。</p>
<p>中國民衆許多實際的行爲，若詳細分析起來，由受了惡劣的讀物的影響而生的，是隨時隨地可以看見。民國初年的時候，民衆們都希望皇帝再現，因爲在民衆讀物或傳説中，記載亂年一有眞命天子出世便可天下太平的故事是太多了。還有前些年在北方，一般民衆最崇拜的人物是吳偑佩孚，他成了民衆的英雄，凡有吳大帥的内戰，大家總是希望而預斷他必然得勝的，這理由便是因爲在民衆的讀物中，凡是有私人道德而又能戰的英雄，總該崇拜的，這不過是隨手舉也來的例子，稍稍留心觀察社會的人，在每天報紙的記載中，準可以看見一兩段記載是文舉的社會的現象。</p>
<p>疎忽這種文學的社會的現象，是新文藝努力者的差恥，而特别是一般文藝批評家們的罪過。作一個今日的文藝批評家，不能只是作着書本的工夫，公式的研究，以及玄妙的解释了。觀照着這樣的社會的現象，是可以寫出最好的批評來，否則批評將没有前途，没有社會的影響的。</p>
<p>現在，支持封建勢力的民衆讀物還在猖獗，它們所發生的社會的惡影響還絲毫没有减少，努力新文藝的人們實在不應該袖手旁觀的。請拿起尖鋭的筆來，像一個手持着刀的醫生對着死屍似地，給它解剖吧。特别是當有明確的社會的現象發現出來時，請不要放鬆它，請把握住它作出鋭利的批評來吧。</p>
<p>就是這一點，我要請求我們的批評家們注意。</p>
<h3>懶學讚</h3>
<p>— 李修</p>
<p>春來鄉間的籬畔星隅又常遇到些蒙童，眼淚婆娑地夾着書包萬分分無奈底脚一步一步朝學校挨，丨説是學校，其實仍是私塾；正如洋襪穿在纏尖的金蓮上，名之曰天足。丨頭一回一回向家門望。看着那種情景，不由人不忍之心油然大發，請求天下賢父母大發慈悲，千萬莫動了希圖富貴的貪念，把嬌生慣養底孩子送去上學。</p>
<p>元宵才過，閙花燈的鑼鼓還在心頭隐隐地響，讀書，何如放鞭砲有滋味？</p>
<p>昨天走過學校門口，門口掛着「學校重地」「閑人莫入」的兩塊虎頭牌，我是　於忙人的一類，自然不在「莫入」之列了，不免跨進去一瞧。喔！墨污滿面地許多小花臉排在書案前，烏</p>
<p>溜溜的眼珠偷偷投過來。先生扳着臉孔在打手心，那小孩鼻涕眼涙糊了一臉。這副樣子够人心驚肉跳，拔脚就逃出來，那位先生還立起身來，我想他必是來追我了。</p>
<p>讀書有甚麽好處？無端要挨竹條板子，記得幼時啟蒙敎師寫着··「家有黄金用斗量不如送</p>
<p>兒上學堂」的字樣敎我摹，和敎我讀「書中自有千鍾粟···」但這個謊很快就打破。不識字倒還可以安靜的活一世，識字而不明白文字是爲恭維主子替主子説好話而設的道理時，便會遭横死。周末被秦坑的那些儒士，東林，復社的那些書生，滿清許多次文字獄中的那些漢子，近代林白水，邵飄萍輩，以及最近的劉煜生等，如果他們綀刀弄槍，當初不去搖筆桿，焉知不功成名就？有了勢力，怕没有賣身投靠的通儒來替你説漂亮話頭，來歌頌功德！何至枉送性命？</p>
<p>那個風流儒雅的皇帝不亡了國，那個開國之君不是赳赳武夫？你才高八斗學富五車還只好做宰相，講究忠順天子，離不了奴才本色。正是</p>
<p>文章相沿幾千秋，令人一見縐眉頭。</p>
<p>世界萬般皆上品，惟有讀書是下流！</p>
<p>但願今朝逃了學，成佛升天都不求。</p>
<h3>説「推敲」</h3>
<p>— 朱淍</p>
<p>「推敲」這詞語的來源，大家都知道··終於賈島選定了「敲」字，是因爲牠來得響喨些。</p>
<p>響喨些固然是不錯的；不過，據我看來，還有一層旁的，更重要的理由，那便是，</p>
<p>僧敲月下門</p>
<p>這一句詩的意境，因爲一個「敲」字的緣故，豐富了許多。</p>
<p>「僧推月下門」，這不過是一個僧人回寺遲了，在夜月之下推着山門，正要進去廟裏；很平凡的一件事，那値得一個詩人去寫成一句詩呢？···如其這僧人是「水浒」内的海闍黎，他所推的門並不是寺廟的，那或許還有一點兒小説的興趣。</p>
<p>至於「僧敲月下門」一句詩，我們却能因之以推測，這僧人確是回寺很遲了，連廟裏的人都以爲他今夜是不回來了的，將廟門關了起來··並且，廟宇是最肅靜的地方，已遲的月夜又是最肅靜的時候，忽然來了這片敲門的聲音，又是一甸習靜的人所來發動的··這各種的聯想，牠們都是由了「敲」這一個字而引起來的。丨文學正是要富於聯想。</p>
<p>「敲」這個字不僅在發音上來得響喨些，牠所引起的聯想也是一片敲破寂靜的響喨。</p>
<p>還有一層，「推」字並不能使這句詩在讀者的情緒上引起任何的返應··「敲」字之中則充滿了期待，置讀者於此僧人的當時的地位上，同了他，在已深的月夜，等候着廟門的開放，在一片攪動了他的自尊心的，餘音仍然波動於月景之内的敲門聲裏。</p>
<h3>巴黎留學生的住和食</h3>
<p>— 復生</p>
<p>做夢似的，在外國住了七八年。回國又快要一月了，人還是糊糊塗塗，夢還不曾做醒一樣。老同學黎烈文兄要我給自由談寫點</p>
<p>東西，寫什麽好呢？這年頭，在中國似乎是不大好説話的，一個不當心，腦袋就有搬家的危險。離開巴黎時，許多朋友不是　就關照我··「以後回國了，不比在外國可以信口亂談，説話可千萬要當心」！一類的話嗎？所以雖是給「自由談」寫稿子，我想還是謹愼點好。現在什麽都不談，單來談談巴黎中國留學生住和食的情形。無讑如何，這總不會犯罪罷？</p>
<p>住</p>
<p>記不清在什麽雜誌上看見一位編輯先生寫的「編輯後記」，裏面介紹一篇留法學生的大作説··「××先生現住在巴黎大學研究社會學」云云。當時看了，忍不住發笑。這位編輯先生大概以爲巴黎大學也和中國各大學一樣，附着有廣大的寄宿舍學生住宿罷？如果他多同幾個從巴黎回來的人談談，他就不會閙出這樣笑話。</p>
<p>原來巴黎入學「文」「法」「理」各科，都位置在巴黎中心區域，賽萊河左岸的第五區（卽舊拉丁區），房子雖大，但祇供上課，實騐，查閲圖書之用，並没有任何一個學生能夠住在裏面。所有巴黎大學的學生都散住在大學附近第五六各區的旅館和公寓（Ｐｅｎｓｉｏｎ）裏，城外各處交通便利的地方，或是奥列安門（ＰｏｒｌｅｄＯｒｌｅａｎｓ）附近的「大學城」（Ｃｉｔｒ　Ｕｎｉｖｅｒｉｔａｉｒｅ）裏面。</p>
<p>「大學城」是由法國政府贈予地皮，由每一個國家建築一座房子集合而成的。各國政府爲誇耀國力並表揚其其本國文化起見，爭以鉅欵在那裏聳立起富麗堂皇的建築，以供其本國學生和一部分法國學生住宿憇游之用。現在已成功的有法·英·美·比·荷·瑞典·加拿大·阿根廷·日本·安南····等學舍，總共可以容納三萬多學生（其中外國學生約占一萬）。聽説以前法國政府也曾劃定一塊地皮請中國政府在那裏建築一座中國學舍，但一年年過去，中國政府始終拿不出錢來，於是法國政府把地皮收回轉贈别國了。</p>
<p>在巴黎的中國留學生，旣因政府不爭氣，没有福分插足「大學城」，於是大多數便住在舊拉丁區和城外蔷微村（ＦｏｎｔｅｎａｙａｕｘＲｏｓｅｓ），皇后鎭（ＢｏｕｒｇｌａＲｅｉｎｅ），拉卜拉斯（Ｌａｐｌａｃｅ）等處。</p>
<p>住在第五六兩區的中國學生，多數聚居在一些髒舊的小旅館裏，這些旅館裏稍爲可住的房子，每月總得三百五十佛郎至四百佛郎（約合國幣七八十元），這樣的房子，中國學生是很少住得起的；中國學生大多數住着一個仄小的「屋頂樓」（Ｍａｎｓｓｒｄｅ）。所謂「屋頂樓」者，卽是現在上海許多新造弄堂房子的「假三層樓」，位置在房屋的最高層，頭頂上没有平整的樓板，而是傾斜的屋脊。巴黎的房子，通常都是七八層的高樓；而這些髒舊的小旅館，又都没有新式的電梯設備；所以住這種最高層的「屋頂樓」的，非有特别好的腿勁不可。中國學生本都没有這樣腿勁的，可是因爲這種房子租價較廉（約國幣四十元一月），便祇得耐着，每天提着沉重的書包，氣喘呼呼地由天國降下地獄，再由地獄爬上天國。</p>
<p>但住在這拉丁區的天國裏的人們，也有許多便利··第一是上課便利，尤其是像我們學理科的人，天天要做實騐，更非住在學校近處不可；第二是頑耍便利，如其你喜歡聽戲，聽音樂，跳舞，看電影，坐咖啡，那自然也非住在城内不可。記得烈文在巴黎的時候，因爲喜歡聽戲，聽音樂的緣故，也曾在拉丁區住過很久，他雖還没入天國，但他住着一個六層樓的房間，也眞眞可以説是「搂近天尺五」了！</p>
<p>至於那些旣不必天天上課，而對於戲劇和音樂之類又没有濃厚的興趣，像那些專誠預備博</p>
<p>士讑文的先生們，那自然住在城外好。因爲城外的房子比城内差不多便宜一半，每月有兩百多佛郎便可以在法國人家找到一個舒服的房間。並且那種房間多半位置在第一層樓上（因爲城外的房子根本就很少超過兩層的），可以免去登降之勞。房子的周圍，常是附着有小小的庭園，打開窗户便可呼吸着在巴黎城内呼吸不到的新鮮空氣。倘若住在蔷微村附近的小山上，那更是風光入盡，使人有世外桃源之想。去年以與童某女士的戀愛糾紛，曾在滬上各報熱閙一時的哲學家（？）李石岑，早幾年就同他的××羅某女士在那兒享受過這樣的艶福。</p>
<p>城外旣然有這些好處，所以現在巴黎的中國學生，常是當學校開課的時候，住在城内；等到暑假，學校停課，便搬住城外。丨丨有錢往瑞士，意大利等處旅行的闊少，那自然又當别讑。</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（十七）</h3>
<p>— 簫伯納作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>「一，缺一，缺二，缺三，缺四。」</p>
<p>他們都拍手了。「好呀」！一個呌道。「牛頓」！又一個説。「來布尼茲」！第三個説。「愛因斯坦」！第四個説。隨卽一齊説道，「出色！出色」！　　「我有話告訴你們」，算是旅行團的人種學者的女士説「接着的偉大的文明會是黑人的文明的罷。白人是不中用了。這他也知道，他便趕緊自殺着」。　　「這樣的一點小事情，怎麽你們就大驚小怪呢」？黑女孩子説。「你們白人怎麽不能發逹起來，而且像我們黑人那樣用心的呢？我初次見到玻璃珠子的時候，我想這眞是出色；可是不多久我對於這種東西就熟了。你們是你們中間一有人説子句什麽呆話，就嚷着出色呀出色呀的。你們所有的最希奇的東西是你們的槍砲了，要明白造槍砲的法子，一定還是等到神容易</p>
<p>些。但是你們的心上偏没有神。你們所開心的只是槍砲你們用了槍砲使我們做了奴隷。於是</p>
<p>因爲你們懶惰到不願放槍砲了，你們將槍砲交給我們敎我們給你們放。你們過幾時，因爲懶惰到不願自已造槍砲了又會敎我們造槍的。你們明白做酒的法子。酒這東西是使人們忘却神、迷蒙良心，而將殺人當作彷彿一件樂事的。你們將這種酒賣給我們，又敎我們做酒的法子。同時你偷我們的土地，逼我們餓死，使我們同恨蛇一樣恨你們。這結局怎樣呢？你們处相殘殺得這麽快，待到我們的武士們灌飽了你們的魔術酒用你們自已的槍恨殺你們的時候，你們那些剩下來的會少到抵抗不住的。過後我們的武士們，也便照你們那樣自相殘殺的，除非他們是被神阻止了，哦哦，我知道我可以找到他的地方了！你們一個人也帮我縛求麽？你們一個人也不關心麽？」</p>
<p>「我們的槍砲是救你們，免得吃人的獅子和踐踏人的象害你們的，可不是麽」？一個性子暴躁的先生説，他對於以前的談話，是一直覺得太深。</p>

<p>圖一用其下論之辯術、三月三日、希脱勒氏發表一長篇之政策宣言、每人皆望希氏能舉述其挽救德國脱離目前危險局面之方針、惟結果彼僅圖以蘇聯爲例、證明共產主義之悲慘結果、吾等雖不欲答復希氏對於蘇聯地位之「分析、」然而此次情形、彼德國之政治家縱不欲救其全人民、至少欲救德國之國家、希氏旣提出此「討論、」當不怨吾等之被迫答復也、近年以來、資本世界之第一流經濟學者、均來蘇聯、研究其經濟發殿、被布爾　科學家及政治家且紛紛討論以蘇聯計劃經濟之實騐試行於資本主義土地之可能、其故非因蘇聯經濟之崩潰及蘇聯民生之困苦也、乃因社會主義經濟之發展、失業之　滅與蘇聯文化之進步、希氏對蘇聯之集合農業建設不提一字、而欲以關於蘇聯恐怖之故事恐嚇德人、世界之開者、必務爲之失笑、彼國社黨人自號爲德國之　國者、以爲彼等較他人能肿障德國之　益、惟其所行政策、則恰相反、　如組織内戰、對於唯一對德不抱敵視之蘇聯、濫　行擊、彼等自信此種爲聪明之行爲、惟吾等以爲由此輩國社黨之紳士爲舵手、德</p>
<p>國之船恐不能抵其遠程也云、「眞理報」發表一社論、題爲「丑角登臺矣、」據稱、德國國會之縱火案、案無人不知其爲國社黨人之挑　行爲、種種情形、均證明此爲法國戈各洛夫案之重演、希脱勒之登臺僅一月、惟在此短時期中、國社黨人對於德國工農之壓迫、已無所不用其極、實則德國法西斯勢力之挑動内戰、其結果僅</p>
<p>足增加德國内政之糾紛、而其對外政策結果、則尤可悲、僅以三十日之時間、彼號爲「國家之代表」者、已與全世界衝突、而不能謹愼擇取相反之道路、該報結論云、彼以「國家」二字冠其名之黨、方使德國陷於孤立、而减弱其國際地位、僅此種丑角之政策、能陷德國於孤立、然而抱此種政策者、恐亦不能久長云云、</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>路路皆通功效毫無</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>日前記者遇到一位新從熱河回來的朋友，我所急於要知道的，就是他此行的結果如何。他説··「路路皆通···功效毫無！」我説··「這未免大矛盾了！」他説··「這雖是矛盾，担確是事實，有什麽辦法呢？」接着又很感慨的説··「話雖如此，但我們仍須奮鬥到底，那麽這大矛盾的現象，還可有消除的希望，不然，則此古老的中國，就一定會輾轉滅亡在這種矛盾狀態之下而後止···」下面就是他解釋何以「路路皆通，功效毫無」的理由··</p>
<p>「我們此次因熱河危急，趕緊跑到平津去做所謂「打氣」的工作，沿途均很受人歡迎，到平津後與各方面接洽，眞是「路路皆通」，無往而不利！但是最後的結果怎樣呢？郤是「功效毫無」！然則是何緣故呢？簡單得很，一班有力執行者，表面上，口頭上，雖是「竭力贊成，一定做到，」的這樣回答，然爲實際上，卻别有打算，成竹在胸，疑神見鬼的顧慮到私人權利，於是遂没有實行的决心。此之謂「路路皆通，功效毫無」。但是國家的獨立，民族的復興，本不是靠他們來成就的，是有待於我們全體民衆覺悟起來自已幹的，所以我們不應當受了這種矛盾的影響爲灰心，我們要格外打起精神，奮鬥到底。」</p>
<p>他説完這番話以後，傍邊還有一位朋友，就接着向我忠告道··「喂！這些話，可不宜於公開發表啊！」是的，從鼓勵民衆方面來説，這些使人聽了不高興的話，實無公開宣揚的必要，但若從喚起民衆的立塲來説，這些話，卻反要大説而特説了。我們知道，現在整個中國的社會，就是充滿了一個大矛盾的社會，我們要改造這社會，必先要十分的了解這一切矛盾的情形與牠如何發生的所由來，然後纔可對症下藥，把牠一掃而光。中山先生的所謂「喚起民衆」不也是要使全體民衆整個的覺醒起來，同心合力的來解决這帝國主義壓迫下，官僚軍閥蹂躏下的矛盾現狀嗎？這「矛盾現狀」之所以能長被稱爲「現狀」而不成爲過去的，就是因爲上自以「喚起民衆」自負的政府，下至以改造社會自命的一班社會領袖丨甚而至於受民衆推崇景仰的人物，根本没有忠實的來做這「喚起民衆」了解這「矛盾現狀」的工作，輾轉因循，遂招致了現在這國破家亡的門面。我們現在難道還要這樣自欺欺人的「諱莫如深」嗎？不是的，我們要盡量的宣揚這整個社會上一切矛盾的現狀，喚起這整個埀危的國魂，來解决這「路路皆通，功效毫無」的矛盾事實。</p>
<p>中山先生在臨死的時候説，他積了四十年的經騐，深知要逹到中國自由平等的目的，心須喚起民衆，共同奮鬥。我們現在反躬自省，我們過去做了多少喚起民衆的工作，這是我們今後政府和人民所應反省而補救的一件事。　　本刊特别啓事　本刊下期擬出「女工及女店員生活專號」，希各界文友踴躍賜稿。凡關於女工·女店員，女招待女員職，女綀習生等之文字或插盡，均所歡迎。報酬從豐</p>
<p>工商業界生活</p>
<h3>這樣的世界</h3>
<p>— 黎英惠</p>
<p>菜販生活</p>
<p>阿富拔完了大頭菜，裝在籃子裏，這時抬起頭來把那零亂的田面望了一下，什麽都没有了。他不禁長嘆了一聲··「完了，用血汗栽種培植的寳貝，到明天就全落到别人的手裏了。」但，他終不能保有它，因爲他要吃飯，要錢用，就不能不賣它。道還用想什麽？不是很簡單的一回事麽？所以阿富就把脖子伸到擔子下，一下子就把兩籃菜擔起來，一直的往屋子裏擔了過去。</p>
<p>妻剛剛燒好晚飯，兩個人像平日一樣面對面坐在一個小方桌旁，就吃了起來。</p>
<p>「不知爲什麽，越是米少，越像吃的快，袋子裏就剩一碗多了。」妻一邊吃飯一邊説。</p>
<p>「哼···」阿富哼了一聲，没有説什麽，但在他的心中，却吸白是怎麽一回事。「就盼望明天上市能賣個大價錢，也就好了。」</p>
<p>聽這話，阿富難過了，日子就是這麽在困苦包着困苦中過去，一年到頭天天把力氣消放在田地上，每天累得疲倦到極點，可是，總是没有一年或者是一天好了一點，使人感到一點快樂。没有，儘是困苦。一眼看到籃子裏的大頭菜，覺得白白的，胖胖的實在可愛，不回答妻説的那句話，阿富另外説話了··「我説，留下五隻大頭菜好不好？」他這話是等着妻的同意。</p>
<p>妻眞的開口了，她説··「我們是種菜過活，可是我們是靠「米」飽肚子的，想吃菜，不是就没有米吃了麽？」妻這話，簡直是一根針，深深的剌入阿富的心，阿富講不出什麽話了。</p>
<p>吃完晚飯，過一會天就黑了。點上燈，阿富要洗大頭菜、却讓妻止住了。妻要他早些睡，明天好起早趕到上海，讓她來洗，洗完裝到籃子裏。阿富没有理由拒絶，就上床去睡了。</p>
<p>一邊在洗菜，阿富妻一邊望着菜出神，在她的本心，未始不想留下五隻自已吃，但五隻可以賣好多錢哪丨那怎樣好呢？不是多賣些就可多擔回來一點米麽？她又想，爲什麽年年種菜，自已倒反不能盡興吃一些，却要賣給一些不用勞力種菜的人們呢？···看看阿富睡在床上的身子，在暗淡的燈光下，她終於留下了三隻。三隻，是的三隻也有三隻的錢，但她愛阿富，不能再盤算三隻的賣價了。她幻想着明天午間阿富就該擔了兩擔米，流着汗，笑嘻嘻的走進屋子裏來。她樂了，趕忙洗完了菜，小心的裝好，接着吹了燈，把身子躺上床，緊緊的抱着阿富睡了起來。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>天還没有亮，阿富妻先醒了，她小聲的喊··「起來·阿富·天快亮了。」喊阿富兩個字，在她是没有幾次的，而每次喊到時，總是因爲她那時特别快活或是興奮的緣故。</p>
<p>阿富醒來了，兩個人都起了床。她點上燈。</p>
<p>不洗臉，不洗手，阿富開了門，然後就擔着擔子直出去了。同平日一樣的，妻一邊關門，一邊説··「賣完菜買了米可快些回來呀！」另外，她這回又加上了一句··「等你擔回來的米下鍋呢！」　　聽完這話，聽到那關門聲，阿富在黑暗的路上走了起來。這事情，是他全然熟悉的，自從他住在這距離上海四里路的小村子以來，也不知趕過多少次早上的菜市。</p>
<p>在路上，一如往日，有許多擔菜的人「杭育」，「杭育」的呌着，一同往上海去，上海，以廉價吸去了他們用血汗種出的蔬菜，換給他們以高價的用品與米。</p>
<p>大地上，雖然各處還在黑暗着，沉睡着，但爲了他們的「杭育」聲，似乎有點呌醒來··黑暗逐漸的稀薄，沉夜爲吵呌佔有了，過一會，東天閃出一線白</p>
<p>光，再過一會，就冒出來紅紅的輪盤般的太陽，於是，天就亮了。必然的，在天明以前，一些擔菜人都會按時趕到上海的。</p>
<p>在路上，他們一些不相識的擔菜人，不時的彼此談些問話，像你是從那里來的，路上好直嗎，或是來價高低，日</p>
<p>子一天比一天不好過一類的話。但他們談的最多而最起勁的，莫過於痛恨上海不勞動而坐享幸福的人，還有那買菜叨叨不休的小氣婆娘和專心爲難的巡捕。一經到了上海，那他們就不能再走一條路了，就每人向着自已往常賣菜的地方走去，以不同的路，分散開了。</p>
<p>阿富，依然像平日似的，把擔子放在平涼路小菜塲旁邊的一個弄堂口。街上盡是買菜人，提着籃子來回走。另外的推粪車的人和放工後的工人，交雜着充滿着早晨的街面。</p>
<p>阿富盼望着快來買主，快賣完，以便買了米快快回家。好，眞的有買主了，像是兩個作娘姨的。她們揀了六隻大頭菜，又把每隻的外皮都剥下一層，阿富看沣眞心痛。講定了兩百四十文一斤，十一斤大頭菜偏給一千五百文，菜，剥了一層皮，又空出十四枚銅板，阿富是鄉下人，可就上了火氣，和她們理論起來。後來兩個人索性不買了，阿富更氣極了，憤憤的説··「不買也行，剥的皮要賠我！」</p>
<p>一個鄉下人，向例是城市人所看不起的，尤其是城市裏做了使女差役的人</p>
<p>，更看着鄉下人擺身分。因此，事情到後來是没有辦法，園了一大堆人看熱閙。但那兩個娘姨，態度却仍很安逸，像滿不在乎似的。阿富呢，指手劃脚的向着人們解釋着，他嘴裏説着一嘴口沬，事情還是照樣的呈現在那裏。</p>
<p>來了兩個巡捕。</p>
<p>「呵，張大哥，」兩個買主中的一個年靑的，招呼着那大個的巡捕，然後把事情照她自已的意思説出來了，歸終説出阿富是壤蛋，是别有所圖。這眞是「天曉得」的事丨阿富趕忙解釋，但是，還不等他説兩句話，那高個巡捕就厲聲問他説··「牌子有麽？」當眞阿富没有買牌子，有牌子也不會把擔子放在弄堂口，而擺在小菜塲上了。他口吃的説··「没···有······先生。」</p>
<p>「跟我走！」</p>
<p>「她要賠······」</p>
<p>那高個巡捕拍的一巴掌打在阿富的臉上，阿富覺得頭一昏，眼睛像冒出許多火星子，把未説完的話打得没有了。　　「走，到行裏去，那有人賠你！」</p>
<p>到這時，阿富明白了。他想還是服軟罷。於是他就央求着説··「先生，我不要賠了，我家人等我買米回家下鍋呢，先生，修修好······」</p>
<p>「走！」那大個巡捕截住阿富的話，「你不要賠，我還要你賠呢！」</p>
<p>阿富心一忡，像是什麽都不知道了，只是本能的像機器人似的擔着擔子，怔怔的跟着那高個的巡捕走去了。</p>
<p>問題討論　童工生活改善問題</p>
<h3>小奴隷之一種</h3>
<p>— 馨</p>
<p>就中國一般的情形而論</p>
<p>，上海是一個機器工業最發逹的地方。可是在比較冷僻的街頭巷尾，尤其是在南市城内一帶，那我們還隨時可以看到苟延着的手工業的作塲。這些作塲因爲被機器工業壓迫的結果，大部分是已瀕於破產了。就是有一小部分尙能支持的，也祇靠了不須出工銀的</p>
<p>學徒做臺柱罷了。</p>
<p>這些俆塲中的學徒，多的往往有一二十個，少的亦三個五個不等。因此，這些學徒，在上海的數量，很是可觀的。這些學徒的來源，大都鄉間赤貧農家的孩子，年齡只有十二三歲。塲主對待他們，往往視爲奴隷燒飯，洗衣，抱小孩子，無所不使，而且絶無何種報酬，連一領衣服亦不肯施</p>
<p>捨的，不但如此，有時連飯都不給吃飽，呵斥之不足或繼之以笞撻　種種虐待可憐的情形，尤非一般工廠和店中的綀習生的生活所可比擬。</p>
<p>關於童工問題的重要，西洋在百年之前就有人注意到了。他們以爲使用幼稚的孩子去勞動是極不人道的。並且，孩子因爲過度的勞動，在生理的發育上一定不能完全，其性情也必變得很暴劣，結果或因此堕落或犯罪，以至葬送他畢生的幸福，就是對於國家社會亦有不</p>
<p>良的影響。所以現在各國都有童工保護法的公佈，對於童工的年齡和工作的時間，都有極嚴格的規定。</p>
<p>中國因爲一切的落後，加之政治和主會的不安，所以許多問題都談不上。可是我覺得關於童工的保護，實在刻不容緩，於童工的年齡，學習的期限及待遇各方面都亟須改善，政府應有法律的規定，且須嚴厲的執行。這雖然還不是澈底的辦法，但也聊勝於無呢！</p>

<p>街頭巷尾</p>
<h3>請普羅作家到民間去</h3>
<p>— 韋卓吾</p>
<p>有一位穿着很漂亮　裝的普羅文學作家因爲一時感覺得寫作材料的缺乏，特地到一家工廠門口去徘徊；希望與放工出廠的工人們談談，也許可以從他們口頭上求得一點自已不曾體會過的普羅經騐和題材。他於是向個衣服很襤褸的工人慇懃説道··</p>
<p>「朋友丨纔放工嗎？唉··你們眞太辛苦了丨你們從早勞動到晚，可憐！廠主把你們血肉之軀，竟當做了没有生命</p>
<p>的機器一般看待呵！」</p>
<p>這個工人不但没有接受他好意的慰問，而且聳一聳肩，反駁似的笑道··</p>
<p>「先生！你那裏知道，我們工人怎能比得上一部機器呢？一個螺釘也不如。機器是廠主的財產，如果工作過度弄壤了，廠主就得受一種損失，所以他們必須要好好的愛護着。我們工人算得什麽？如果勞力被榨乾了，或是因爲過勞而毁傷了身體，他們祇説聲「滚你媽的！」我們就被一脚踢廠出外來了。先生！你把我們比着機器，未免太高抬了吧</p>
<p>！」</p>
<p>這位作家討了一塲没趣，見話不投機，也不便往下再談，祇有向歸途上走</p>
<p>。忽然遇見一個公館裏的老女僕，提着水壼出來泡水··心想··「我可以從她口裏，得着什麽啓示吧！」於是又很懇摯</p>
<p>的説道··</p>
<p>「老人粗！這大年紀，還出來供奔走的苦役嗎？你的主人把你當着狗一般的驅使，眞可憐呵！」</p>
<p>在這位作家的心理，以爲把她比做畜生，總該不會再像那工人一樣怪他太高抬了，誰知結果竟出他意料之外。那老女僕答道··</p>
<p>「先生丨你怎麽把我比狗呢？我如果眞能變做我家主人的愛狗阿黑，倒是我幾世幾生修到的幸福呢！牠每天吃的是特製狗餅乾，新鮮牛肉，臥的是温暖被褥，受着主人的愛撫，過着安樂的生活。我那一樣及得上牠丨我拿什麽比牠！」</p>
<p>這位作家又討了一塲没趣，覺得這次出來，搜集材料的機會不利，悵悵的進了一家酒排間，要了一杯咖啡，吃了幾個西點，就回到他自已的洋房裏去了</p>

<h3>「生路」爲什麽不准在租界内開映？</h3>
<p>— 冰</p>
<p>奇怪得很，蘇聯影片「生路」曾在二十七個國家裏開映過，可是不能在帝國主義統治下的租界内開映··帝國主義的本國内可以映演，而其統治下的殖民地或次殖民地則不能，這裏，你可以探討出些原由來。</p>
<p>帝國主義本國内的無產階級，固然使帝國主義者有些頭痛，但是，聰明的帝國主義者，他們會拚命的從殖民地多搜括些財寳來，把本國内無產階級的生活，略爲改良點，於是，帝國主義者以爲，這樣，他們本國内的無產階級就可以被軟化而右傾了，而「生路」也就可以出映了。其實　，這還是帝國主義者自已安慰自已的話。</p>
<p>但是，殖民地的民衆怎樣呢？當然的，生活是加倍的凄慘起來，也是當然的，社會革命加倍的容易爆發起來。帝國主義者很曉得，這是非常危險的，於是，用盡心思，想盡方法，最好呌殖民地的民衆，不要覺悟，永遠糊塗，愚蠢，永遠做他們的奴隷，又於是，許許多多羅曼絲的，香艶的，肉感的······片子，就都應運而生的到殖民地來麻醉勞苦民衆了。可是，蘇俄的影片呢，恰巧和這個相反，所以，帝國主義者就馬上鐵板起面孔説··「這裏不准映！」</p>
<p>靠近北極圏冷死人的地方，突然的樹起了一個古怪的國家，這國家的一切</p>
<p>正和帝國主義的國家處在極端相反的地位，而且，這國家又最喜歡和弱小民族親近，這當然，更是危險的事。於是，帝國主義者就造出許多連他們自已都要發笑的謠言來中傷牠，説牠怎樣的不好，甚至於還要向牠唾一口唾沬，説得殖民地的民衆都要有些相信了。可是，這</p>
<p>影片「生路」却是恰恰相反的指出了他們的愚妄，於是，帝國主義者慌張了，立刻搖起他們巨大的鐵手説··「這裏不准映！」</p>
<p>這些，就是租界上不准映演「生路」的理由了。</p>
<p>其實，你愚蠢的帝國主義者呀！時代的巨輪是永遠不會回頭的，你滅亡的命運終究是要到來的，禁映了個把蘇聯的影片，又何濟於事呢？</p>
<p>生意經</p>
<h3>經營小本生意的經騐談</h3>
<p>— 家詳</p>
<p>我去年在江　辦一家小商店，發售烟紙雜貨之類，資本計共五百元，除去櫃台貨架，以及房租等，流動資本僅約四百元，營業倒還發逹，但不幸在滬戰時關門了。</p>
<p>在不幸的命運中，我却獲得了好些經營小本生意的經騐，茲特撮述一二，以供參考··</p>
<p>（一）如何裝點門面　櫃台招牌以及貨架等，都要點綴得出色，這在小本商店，可作廣告用的。最好能用　的紙盒，如香烟盒，肥皂盒等，堆在貨架上面，使顧客進店，發出「貨積如山」的感想，而其實小商店的貨物是並不多的。</p>
<p>（二）不要浪費一個錢　經營小商業最易犯的毛病是浪費··因爲在櫃台裏面，滿眼都是錢，而且滿街都是商品，化錢是很便當的。不知多化一塊錢，就少一塊錢的資本，還少幾毛錢的利息··小處不謹愼，就能惹出倒店的大禍來。所以開小商店的，最好連一個錯錢，一個閒錢，也不要亂化··環境上如没有變更，營業是會好的。</p>
<p>（三）怎樣去販買貨物　販賣貨物要因時因地因人，隨機應變··要先賣出，後買入，勿多留存貨。最好託人介紹，或自已去與某作坊某公司定下合同，這樣，可以先提貨物，從付錢（或先付半價，或三分之一），因爲借他人資本經營商業，實是最便利的辦法··但爲防意外起見，也不要賖貨太多。</p>

<h3>意外的阻力</h3>
<p>— 邵佐軒</p>
<p>編者先生··我是一個店員，没有事是不敢來勞你的神。現在因爲我有一個姓趙的朋友，他去年結識了一個女子，彼此愛情頗篤，都抱着「有情人終成眷屬」的希望，大有「非卿不娶，非郎不嫁」之慨。但是現在他們竟遇到了意外的阻力··原來這女子的家屬，全都是「謨罕默德」的信徒，而趙君則否。據回敎的敎規，他們的子女，是絶對不許與敎外人結婚的，所以她的家長，就絶對所對這一椿婚姻。</p>
<p>先生，你是一個善於解答難題的人，所以我特地代他們寫了這封信，請問回敎徒與非回敎徒爲甚麽不許結婚，在法律上有没有規定？我在這裏，用十二萬分的誠意，恭候你的答復。（下略）</p>
<p>邵佐軒謹上</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>編者按··我不是任何一敎的信徒，但我對於各敎的敎義，都曾經有過相當的研究。牠們雖各有各的牽强之處，但是牠們都殊途同歸，勸人向善，這一點，當然是不可抺煞的。所以一個人，皈依一種宗敎，以堅其向善之心，似乎我們不應該反對。不過各敎的敎規，多少都含有若干不合情理的條例，實在使人難受··上面邵君所講的一節，就是其中之一。我們想一個回敎徒與非敎徒結婚，任何方面都不會發生不良影響。就是講到宣揚敎義一方面，也未始不可借重同化的力量，來　利用一下。現在偏要加以限制，實在是很不合理的。</p>
<p>因此，我們要勸趙君的女友，用大無畏的精神，與趙君結婚。好在法律是許可你們這樣做的，敎規終不能來施行制裁呢。你倘使不情願因爲愛情的緣故，放棄敎的信仰，那末也是無妨。因爲他們敎友敎長等等，只可驅逐你出清眞寺之外··但斷没有力量，來禁制你在家裏讀「可蘭」經呢。况且你這種工作，實際上旣不背敎義，反可將敎裏的一件不合理的規例草除，就是「謨罕默德」在天之靈，也要笑逐顏開，許你是一個衣鉢堪傳的敎徒呢。你只須看從前天主敎裏，也有不准與敎外人結婚的規定，現在又怎樣了。</p>

<h3>最後消息</h3>
<p>我軍攻入錦州</p>
<p>遼西方面，我東北義軍曾一度攻入錦州，惜因後援不繼，重復退出。但這是前幾天的事，暫且不在話下，却説本刊最近收到幾篇關於女工及女店員生活的稿子，擬於下期出專號，希望讀者諸君儘量賜敎，無論文字或插晝均所歡迎，而關於女綀習生及女招待的尤感需要。</p>
<p>主力戰已開始</p>
<p>中國多八「失」，即東北多失地，工廠多失火，飛機多失事，詩人多失戀，電影女明星多「失足恨」，勞苦民衆失業失學，努力抗日反帝運動者多失踪··在這八「失」之中，本刊對於「督促政府迅即收復失地」及「救濟失業」這兩項工作，自信尙能加以相當的注意而不甘落入之後，尤其是在這盪動的世界局面之下，你雖欲置這些事於不聞不問之列，也是不可而得的了。</p>
<p>現在，熱河方面，中日兩軍主力戰業已開始，在這危急存亡之秋，自然我們是希望我軍能獲得最後的勝利，而不致爲着「戰略」的關係，全部退出中國，集中帕米爾高原去「搆築新陣地」。但同時，我們做阿斗的，也要把本身嚴密的組織起來，力圖自救，更聯合其他弱小民族及其他被壓迫民衆，共同作戰，使這抗日反帝運動的浪潮繼續高漲起來。我們要打破過去專依賴那些不可靠的統治者，「高等華人」及只請纓而不抗日的將軍們的幻想。至於希望日本自動的舉起雙手來把東北捧還給中國，或是希望帝國主義分贓機關的國聯用大幅廣告在日内瓦報紙上招領東北的失地，那更是個永不會成事實的迷夢了！全中國的阿斗們呀！你們不要以爲「失街亭」是小事，要知道，萬一他日整個的民族淪亡之後，正不知有多少你們的子孫，要學劉諶的「哭祖廟」而又找不到「死無其所」的你們的墳墓呢！</p>
<p>總之，當目前這樣嚴重的關頭，本刊的使命無疑地是加倍的重大了，因此，爲喚醒民衆起見，此後我們將特别歡迎關於抗日救國一類的稿子。</p>
<p>其次，對於「救濟失業」，本刊自我職業介紹欄自在本報本埠增刊上增闢地位後，該欄來稿雖較前增加十倍之多，但内容富於趣味的却百不得一，以致减少讀者興趣，失去文字效力。若長此下去，不但對於失業者自身毫無補益，即該欄亦有被取消之虞。幸投稿諸君注意及此！（編者）</p>

<p>有人説··美國有兩個大總统，白宮裏的和「黑宮」裏的，前者是統治白天的美利堅合衆國，而後者是統治着黑夜裏的。</p>
<p>號稱世界的「黄金國」的美國，盜匪首領的勢力却眞很有些「炙手可熱」，他們有着廣大而嚴密的組織，深固的力量，能夠得到一部份上流社會的捧塲，著名的匪首，受多數人民的崇拜，「無冕之王」的新聞記者，竟亦以訪問爲榮，著作家且爲之立傳呢！</p>
<p>從前，大家祇知道負着「匪都」盛名的紐約和支加哥有着盜匪出没的蹝跡。粉紅色的好萊塢總是理想中的極樂世界。誰都能想到··那邊有的是醉人的酒香，撲鼻的粉香，和迷魂的肉香，全世界的摩登少爺和摩登小姐，誰都想到那邊去。</p>
<p>據洛杉磯的通信，最近的好萊塢正成了「支加哥」第二，盜匪非常活躍，甚</p>
<p>至要超過「支加哥」的「盛名」了。全好萊塢的人都有危險的感覺，尤其是有名的男女明星，時常會有「不速之客」光顧他們漂亮的住宅。</p>
<p>最近，好萊塢有一個假冒送電報者的匪徒搶去了女明星培蒂康蓀所帶的珠寳首飾，價値五萬美金。上月一日晚，泊林格兒之濱海别墅有二盜潛入，刦去鈔票一千金。又二日晚，哥倫比亞美術室經理白利斯金之住宅，有許多盜匪闖入，刦去價値四萬二千元美金的珠飾。同時，嘉脱登姑娘，勃倫脱等均曾遭匪刦。警察當局，除在花萊塢加派崗警以外，並在用着全力特别偵查此數種案件。</p>
<p>朱唇如雨，粉腿如林的好萊塢，雖然仍是那樣的「珠光寳氣」，「燈紅酒綠」，但已不是可以「高枕無憂」的「天堂樂土」了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>我俩婚史</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>昨天新光換映的新片，原名ＭｅａｎｄｍｙＧａｌ譯成了「我俩婚史」，命題廣泛，字義俚俗·似乎有些不妥吧？</p>
<p>這片名是在表示着，牠是一部戀愛滑稽，果然，不出所料，不過爲了太注重在滑稽片上了，所以本來很有可爲的一個劇本，所演成了種種的不合理了。　　你女友的妹妹，雖已和一個船員結婚，但是她的舊情人是一個積盜，越獄而出，脅迫她代爲設計，藏身她家，她旣攝於淫威，又感於舊誼，所以只好不對外人説，但是她久病的老父，却洩秘密於探目。於是探目來捕，互以手鎗格鬥，盜死，探目也受了微傷，但他得了官廳重賞，携着他新結婚的妻子，登輪度密月去了。</p>
<p>飾探目的是史彭沙屈來斯ＳｐｅｎｅｅｒＴ</p>
<p>ｒａｃｙ他是英俊而倜儻瀟洒，在嚴肅之中，都帶有詼諧的態度。面部表情，也還不錯，他的女友就是瓊裴納特Ｊｏａｎ　Ｂｅｎｎｅｔｔ當然我們很認識她的藝術的。這次，她不是天眞少女，而是一個很忠厚而飽經世故的女郎了。訓妹兩幕，非常精彩，描寫一個女子和愛情，也淋漓盡致，配角方面，也都很好。不過節瓊的妹妹的瑪琳彭爾絲Ｍ　ａｒｉｏｎ　Ｂｕｒｎｓ却不大好，勉强而已。</p>
<p>導演平常得很，的確，福斯公司的出品，雖然好片子極多，而導演特别好的却極少。光線只能説平常，攝影也還好，只有幾個特寫部份，倒很可觀。佈景很簡單的，總之，牠没有特出的技能，所以不大容易討好的。</p>
<p>另一點，對白很在趣，動作也極好。穿插幾乎儘了全片的一半，處處迥照，可稱上乘。還有内中一小段，（談愛初吻一幕）把兩人思想也用「傍參對白」，出來説，眞是把男女談情的假面具揭破了，口和心的矛盾，呌人笑不可仰，這種攝法是很少的，生色不少。</p>
<p>全片旣多滑稽穿插，所以也就成了一個「全部諧片」，不過對白中笑料居多，美國習慣上的滑稽小動作也不少，不諳英語，不懂美國習慣的人，都茫然莫解，只好看着别人笑罷了。</p>
<p>劇情受穿插之累，而不近情之處也很多，而且有許多地方的發笑也太嫌過大些了。</p>
<p>綜觀全片，當在水平綫上，允稱上乘的表演。但因導演的避難就易，無端用許多暗寫，把劇情弄得極糢糊，平空的配角滑稽穿插，反將主角的精彩處，掩没了，眞是可惜之至。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「三生石」</h3>
<p>— 菁生</p>
<p>在未嘗完全脱離封建因襲的中國農村社會中·兩個村莊間的互相仇視，甚至於械鬥·這一種必然會發生的現象，也可以説是常事。這「三生石」所描寫的就是這麽的題材，但是裏面却穿插着一個戀愛的故事。</p>
<p>故事是這樣··在某礦山中的甲乙兩個材莊，因歷年爭地採石成仇！而甲村村長的女兒却和乙村的小主戀愛着，并欲謀消仇，共圖生存發展，誰知甲村村長所最信任的工頭，因涎村長女兒之美，乃率衆往刦乙村的財物，并殺乙村的村主，更復欲殺乙村的小主，以絶後患。其時，那惡工頭誘醉村長之後，即欲對其女兒施以蹂躏，村長驚醒，與鬥，被殺、幸乙村小主趕至，戮死惡工頭，使甲乙兩村重歸和好，留下這三生之石。</p>
<p>這「三生石」確是一個比较好的題材，而編劇者的好處是在不把戀愛當正面寫，壤處則在於結尾那個地方··兩村的積仇，却能殺戮一個惡工頭，而和好如初？導演者在這裏顯示得非常的努力，除了幾個小處的錯悞外，大體上可以説是成功的。演員呢？除了飾惡工頭的陳斌的表情有點過火外，餘的都不錯，尤其王春元自飾的乙村小主，更顯得活躍。其他如置景，攝影，燈光等等，還希算是可以。總之，這是在小公司的出品中，比較進步而値得一看的戲啊！</p>
<p>最近明星日報選舉獲稱皇后的胡蝶女士近影</p>
<h3>評電影皇后選舉的結果一點有所見的陳述</h3>
<p>— 慕珠</p>
<p>明星日報主辦電影皇后舉已揭曉了。胡蝶女士得二萬一千三百三十四票獲選。陳玉梅女士得一萬三千零二十八票次之。阮玲玉女十得七千二百九十票屈居第三位。選舉的結果令我大大的失望。我覺得一百個電影迷之中，除純粹洋化的電影迷外，到少有九十九個應當擁護阮玲玉。爲什麽呢？自從聯華的作品問世後，阮女士參加的片子由野草開花以至最近的「三個摩登的女性」。扮蕩婦像蕩婦，扮鄉女像鄉女她的作風不時的轉變；然而她一舉一動，莫不把劇中人的個性表現得痛快淋漓。美麗固然是重要；可是藝術比其他一切的條件更重要。如果祇以貌取人的話，好萊塢一九三一年的電</p>
<p>影皇后選舉，豈能輪到瑪　特蘭潄（Ｍａｒｉｅ　Ｄｒｅｓｓｌｅｒ）來獲選呢？可惜得很，我祇有唯一的感想··「何以欣賞藝術的同志這麽少，而崇拜美人的同志這麽多」</p>
<h3>謹祝胡蝶女士勝利</h3>
<p>— 楊賽秋</p>
<p>這次明星日報主辦的，電影皇后選舉大會，日前已經總揭曉了。觀衆之選舉胡蝶女士爲皇后者，當然胡女有値得當選的地方。藝術的超羣，表演的眞切</p>
<p>，這都是有被選的緣故。不然陳玉梅，阮玲玉，楊耐梅，等等爲何會落後呢？總之這都是胡女士過去的奮鬭換來的結</p>
<p>晶。最後我希望胡蝶女士不要負了觀衆的一片熱心才是。（却酬）</p>
<h3>「到上海去？」的參觀記</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>三一公司的滑稽片「到上海去？」那天在上海公司拍最後的一幕内景「火燒書樓間」午夜十二時開拍，攝影塲裏的摩登佈景，襯配着極濃的黄烟！攝影機面前，也放着烈𦦨的大火。兩位死人面孔的滑稽家王旡能，江笑笑，他俩冒着</p>
<p>烟火闖進室裏去，救錢似鶯和薛玲仙，</p>
<p>王旡能和江笑笑，他們冒火進室，火由門縫裏　出，燒着了王旡能的屁股，他確鎭靜地呌</p>
<p>着「火燒屁股，且顧脚下」第二陣火來，正燒着江笑笑的後腦！他也呌着「火燒後腦，不知顧甚麽好···」引得參觀的人們大家都笑了起來。</p>
<p>最後，他們俩要背負錢似鶯和薛玲仙逃出，</p>
<p>誰知薛玲仙產後發胖，體重已增至一百九十多磅！這俩傻瓜誰也背不動，江笑笑大告奮勇，用盡了力氣，纔把薛玲仙背了出去。</p>
<h3>雪爾維薛妮怕拍照</h3>
<p>在好蘭塢，誰都不會想到雪爾維薛妮會這樣</p>
<p>的怕上鏡頭，當攝影記者包圍著她要求攝影的時候。眞的，她是怪怕羞的，縱然在銀幕上的時候，她的羞澁性是隠藏了的。但在銀幕之外，她的脾氣，就古怪得好似變成另一種人格，這種人格在她自已也是幾乎不會相信的。當有一天，她在夕陽影裏的郊外間游的時候，有一個攝影記者在後面看見她的背影眞美，於是便想偷拍一張玉照，他就準備好鏡頭，但爲欲使她的頭轉過來把面部的正面露映出來，他就突然高聲喊一聲雪爾維薛妮的芳名，當然薛妮便把頭側轉過去，一眼望見是一個可怕的鏡頭正對着她，她就捷足先登的掩過了鏡頭，向旁的地方逃之夭夭，那記者正在高興的時候，徒以一忽之錯，讓此大機會溜去，大呼負負不止。</p>

<p>— 時</p>
<p>昨天她曾給一種特殊的恐怖所威嚇。今天她可以笑了。可是當時的恐怖是會永久潛伏在她的美目之瞳憬下的。</p>
<p>「來啊，保羅！」她笑着。「你似乎很愼重其事的幹甚麽！現在···甚麽都没有問題了！」似乎她已細細地辨過它的愉快性一般。「民衆將有國會了。一個新的俄國將產生了」。</p>

<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops in Fierce Battle with the Enemy</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Frontline dispatch: In the Chifeng area, the enemy forces, led by Mogi, with 3,000 cavalry and 20 tanks, attacked Sasui Slope and Jianchangyingzi on the morning of the 3rd. Two regiments of Sun Dianying's troops fought bravely, killing three to four hundred enemies. By noon on the 3rd, the enemy forces were unable to withstand the attack and retreated in defeat. On the evening of the 3rd, Sun's troops divided into two routes and advanced towards Baitasi, bypassing the Hala Road intersection. Fierce battles broke out on the morning of the 4th. In the Lingyuan area, our troops reinforced and launched a counterattack, recapturing important passes near the city. The enemy is now facing encirclement within the city. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) From the Chifeng front, the volunteer forces led by Feng Zhanhai and others have been ordered by Sun Dianying to withdraw to the rear areas, such as the Weichang hunting grounds, for rest and recuperation. On the morning of the 3rd, Sun personally led a thousand troops, including those under Shi Wenhua, to launch a counterattack northeast of Chifeng. They had already recaptured the Fang Shen position early on the 3rd, killing over two hundred enemies. The enemy is currently retreating to Wushijiazi, with a large force concentrated in Xinmiao. Fighting was still ongoing in the area on the 4th. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Geng Jizhou Arrives in Beiping from Rehe</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Volunteer Army Commander Geng Jizhou arrived in Beiping from Rehe this morning to discuss important matters. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that a certain famous leader of the Volunteer Army recently returned to Beiping from Rehe and was severely questioned by the authorities regarding why the Volunteer Army in Rehe was not fighting. This morning, the leader was escorted back to Rehe to relay instructions to his subordinates to fight, or face execution. (4th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rehe Provincial Government Detains Military Vehicles</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Two days ago, 240 military vehicles from the front were detained by the Rehe Provincial Government. Weng Zhaoyuan repeatedly telegraphed Chengde requesting the dispatch of vehicles to transport artillery shells, but they never arrived. It was then discovered that the vehicles had been detained. At the same time, Tang Yulin was using the vehicles to transport personal belongings towards Gubeikou. Upon receiving this information, Zhang sent personnel to intercept them at Gubeikou, releasing the vehicles back to the front for military transportation. Zhang has now dispatched two divisions and eight hundred military police to garrison Gubeikou. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Tianjin Delineates Garrison Zones</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Search Various Hotels</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) As a result of several secret meetings by the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, the city has been divided into several zones: 1. The Nanshi and Dongmalu areas are designated as garrison zones; 2. The First and Third Special Districts are designated as silver crossing zones; 3. The Second Special District is designated as occupied zones; 4. The inner city and Hebei are designated as artillery fire zones; 5. The French and Japanese concessions are designated as protected zones. It is also rumored that the number of plainclothes agents hired by the Japanese army is unknown, but said to be three to four thousand. In the event of future disturbances, they will all be driven into the Chinese area to first throw incendiary bombs, causing chaos, and then fire at the Japanese Concession, whereupon the Japanese soldiers will use this as a pretext to launch an attack. Our military and police authorities have already prepared countermeasures against this conspiracy. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Concession suddenly showed signs of tension on the evening of the 3rd. The Japanese police station dispatched special agent teams to search various hotels. Japanese soldiers were also on alert at the Sino-Japanese border and were searching pedestrians. By the morning of the 4th, things had returned to normal. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Beiping City Levies Vehicles, Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Exemption</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping City Chamber of Commerce, due to the recent military requisition of vehicles, horses, and camels, has resulted in an insufficient number of vehicles for transportation within the city. They have petitioned the military authorities for exemption from requisition to maintain the people's livelihood. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Various organizations have hired 3,000 rickshaws to transport supplies to Rehe. Rickshaws are now extremely scarce in the city. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, the government conscripted rickshaws throughout the city, causing significant disruption to traffic. Upon inquiring with the police, it was learned that each police station was ordered to conscript five rickshaws, and the rickshaw pullers were also required to go along. Therefore, several thousand rickshaws have already been conscripted. Many rickshaw pullers have fled and disappeared. There is no sign of rickshaws on the streets, only a few private vehicles are moving about. It is said that the conscripted rickshaws have now been sent to Gubeikou to assist in military transportation. (4th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Our Troops Suffer in Battle Under the Threat of Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>The Roads in Central Rehe are Rugged</p>
<p>Our Army's Transportation Relies Solely on Livestock</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Squadrons Run Rampant Everywhere</p>
<p>Our Trenches are Equivalent to Death Traps</p>
<p>(Beiping) We have just received a dispatch from a special correspondent for Reuters in Chengde, detailing the difficult situation of the Chinese army in battle. It is said that under these conditions, even well-equipped and well-trained foreign troops would be at a loss and unable to display their strengths. Central Rehe is characterized by continuous and very steep mountain ranges. Within 75 miles of Chengde, there are only a few rocky riverbeds that can be used for troop transport. The ice in these riverbeds has only just melted. The only route into the province is a rugged and narrow path. If there are too many people traveling back and forth, there will be congestion. The valleys extending east from Pingquan and north from Chifeng are conducive to transportation, but the mountains, valleys, and mountain passes are easily subjected to enemy aircraft bombardment. The Chinese army has absolutely no means of self-defense here. Furthermore, the mountains are devoid of trees, and the valleys offer no cover. Therefore, the trenches are equivalent to death traps. Japanese aircraft squadrons lead tank units in their advance, leveling villages and towns in the areas they pass through. The Chinese army not only has no aircraft but also no tanks. Six days ago, those who traveled on the main road from Chaoyang to Chengde witnessed the difficulty of transporting troops and supplies to the front lines. The main means of transport were camels, mules, and ox carts, as well as a few trucks. Wheeled vehicles are almost useless when the ice and snow melt, and the ground becomes wet. Even at this time, enemy aircraft had already begun bombing undefended villages along the way, which travelers could clearly see. Later, the Japanese army advanced from Chaoyang, launching a major attack. Aerial combat became increasingly fierce. The Japanese army easily advanced by virtue of its air power, stopping only slightly west of Pingquan. From Pingquan to Chengde, a distance of about fifty miles, there are only two passes that can be traversed, and they are very rugged. If one can resist aerial attacks with flesh and blood, it may still be possible to prevent the Japanese army from advancing rapidly or even halting their advance. The road north of Chifeng is also very difficult to travel. However, the morale of troops crowded in valleys and mountain passes is easily undermined by fierce aerial bombardment. A few days ago, the morale of the Chinese troops on the front line was very high, and the supply lines were running smoothly. Later, Japanese aircraft appeared, proving that it takes supreme courage to stand against these iron birds in the sky. (4th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Continue to Increase in the Yuguan Area</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Qinhuangdao telegram: The Japanese army in Yuguan is extremely busy with troop movements. The front line in Shihe is very tense. The Japanese have increased their troops in Erlangmiao, Jiaoshan, Huzhuang, and other places. Another Japanese warship has arrived in Qinhuangdao. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing's Volunteer Army Ambush Chaoyang, Destroying Several Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Frontline dispatch: On the night of the 2nd, at 11:00 PM, the National Salvation Army led by Zhu Jiqing, including the divisions under Liu Chunqi and Wang Yuanping, launched a surprise attack on the enemy forces in Chaoyang from the Lanziyingzi and Mangniuyingzi areas. They first occupied the airfield outside the East Gate and the new pass. The enemy guards were caught off guard and fled in panic into the city. Several aircraft were destroyed. Subsequently, a large enemy force rushed out of the city. The National Salvation Army fought back for an hour before retreating. Also, a certain unit of the enemy Suzuki Brigade, numbering about five to six hundred men, marched south from Chaoyang on the morning of the 3rd, intending to advance towards Dongdachengzi in Lingyuan. They were ambushed by Zhu's troops near Yangshan, suffering approximately one hundred casualties. The remaining troops fled in disarray. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The defense zone of the Northeast National Salvation Army under Zhu Jiqing is located on a key route for the Japanese invasion of Rehe. They have repeatedly clashed with the Japanese invaders. Since Beipiao, Kailu, and Chaoyang have fallen in succession, the situation is particularly critical. The army's liaison office in Tianjin, due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy invaders, and fearing encirclement if they hold their original defenses, repeatedly telegraphed the front, advising Zhu to temporarily retreat. Zhu replied that the local people's morale is high and that an offensive is possible. Although there are difficulties, holding the line is still within reach. They have now constructed multiple layers of defensive fortifications and are determined to defend to the death and not retreat hastily, thereby emboldening the enemy. (4th, special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Propaganda Group Conducts Propaganda in Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After arriving in Qinhuangdao, the Central Propaganda Group has been working hard to promote resistance against Japan to the military, civilians, and various sectors of society in Shimenzhai, Liujiang, Shihe, Qinhuangdao, and other places. The atmosphere is extremely tense. Soldiers on the front line are eager to try and are determined to kill the enemy. Army Commander He Zhuguo is even more impassioned, repeatedly using the principles of defending the country and protecting the people to encourage his subordinates. The Japanese invaders are now launching an all-out attack on Rehe, and the front line on the Beining Railway is quite calm. (4th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Fall of Chengde, Indeed</h3>
<p>Since the loss of the three northeastern provinces and the retreat of the Northeast Army to Jinzhou, the generals and officials defending the territory declared to us their determination to resist the invaders. However, Jinzhou was soon lost as well. From Jinzhou to the retreat and defense of Yuguan, proclamations and telegrams about resisting the enemy and defending the territory were once again grandiose. Yet, in a few months, Yuguan also fell. Now it has come to Rehe. The calls to resist the enemy and defend the territory are indeed very loud. But what is the current situation in Rehe?</p>
<p>When Jinzhou fell, northern dispatches publicized how they resisted. However, foreign news reported that the Japanese troops did not shed a drop of blood, and our side did not fire a single shot. When Yuguan fell, northern dispatches also exaggerated the courage of their resistance. But in reality, it was probably just sacrificing a small number of troops to obtain a false reputation for resistance. Otherwise, why would a crucial fortress like Yuguan only have one or two regiments of troops stationed there? Moreover, if the officers and soldiers were truly determined to resist, the 19th Route Army could hold out for more than a month in the plains of Shanghai. Why would the natural defenses of Jinzhou and Yuguan be lost in a day? From this, we cannot help but firmly believe that from the September 18th Incident to the loss of Jinxi, the generals and officials defending the territory adopted a policy of seeking temporary peace through non-resistance. The loss of Jinzhou and Yuguan was a strategy of seeking temporary peace under the guise of resistance. What is the so-called resistance in Rehe now?</p>
<p>The facts show us that Rehe, known for its natural defenses and being difficult to attack, has already been penetrated by the enemy. Now Chengde has been reported to have fallen, and those in charge of military command and stationed in North China are still leisurely far away, delaying their arrival at the front. Can this be said to be a determination to fight?</p>
<p>The start of the preliminary battles in Rehe was long before the establishment of the puppet state, more than a year ago. May I ask, did the generals and officials defending North China have sufficient preparation during this long period? If they had preparation, why did they lose famous cities in quick succession within ten days, despite relying on its natural defenses, and even Chengde could not be defended? Before the outbreak of this hot war, the lengthy dispatches were still deceptive rhetoric to cover up the truth. The determination to resist must be verified by the fact of resistance, and the fact of resistance cannot rely solely on a piece of publicity. The establishment of border officials is for the purpose of defending the territory. Losing land and troops cannot be glossed over with the name of resistance. In this matter, there is a clear responsibility, and it cannot be solely blamed on Tang Yulin and the Volunteer Army. Those who seek temporary peace will inevitably harm the country in the end. If it is believed that temporary peace can last, then please learn from the facts of the past. The abandonment of Jinzhou was originally intended to stop the enemy's advance. The light defense of Yuguan was also intended to seek the enemy's understanding. However, the result was precisely to play into the enemy's gradual encroachment strategy. If today's abandonment of Rehe is to seek temporary peace in Beiping and Tianjin, can Beiping and Tianjin be guaranteed forever? Can temporary peace last?</p>
<h3>Political Shifts Amidst the Surging Financial Turmoil in the United States</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Sworn into Office Yesterday Afternoon. The Ceremony Was Simple but Solemn and Dignified. Tens of Thousands of People Crowded Together to Watch the Ceremony Amidst Thunderous Cheers. The Democratic Party Regains Power and Hundreds of Government Affairs Await Management.</p>
<p>(Washington) Franklin Delano Roosevelt, an advocate of liberalism and initiator of domestic and foreign policy reform movements, was sworn in as the 32nd President of the United States this afternoon. Standing before the podium in the Capitol, surrounded by dignitaries, Mr. Roosevelt raised his hand and placed it on the open Bible, taking the oath under the supervision of Chief Justice Hughes, vowing to uphold and protect the U.S. Constitution and deliver his inaugural address. Over twenty Supreme Court justices, governors from various states, members of the new cabinet, members of both houses of Congress, dignitaries from all walks of life, and diplomatic representatives from 56 countries attended. Fifty thousand spectators looked on below, and even nearby rooftops were filled with those eager to witness the grand event. The U.S. seal, placed in front of the microphone, was the most important symbol of the transfer of power. Several aircraft soared through the sky, adding to the grand occasion. The entire ceremony can be divided into three sections: first, the former president accompanying the new president from the White House to the Capitol; second, the swearing-in and inaugural address inside the Capitol; and third, the new president leading a procession back to the White House. Mr. Roosevelt arrived at the White House at around 10 a.m., and was accompanied by President Hoover in a ceremonial carriage, escorted by cavalry, to the Capitol. Cheers erupted from the crowds lining the streets as the carriage passed by. At noon, Vice President Garner and new senators were sworn in at the Senate chamber, followed by the playing of the national anthem. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, President Roosevelt ascended the podium, took the oath, and delivered his inaugural address. After the speech, he shook hands with those congratulating him, then boarded the ceremonial carriage with his wife. Governors, military and civilian representatives lined up to escort the carriage back to the White House. Upon arriving at the White House, he ascended the viewing platform, awaiting the passing of the procession and greeting them. With this, the inauguration ceremony concluded. Afterwards, there was a military parade to conclude the events. President Roosevelt, representing the Democratic Party, is taking over the reins of power for the first time since President Wilson. Since the founding of the United States, Mr. Roosevelt is the tenth Democratic president. However, at the time of his inauguration, forty-eight states are caught up in financial turmoil, and the national economy is in a state of disrepair, urgently awaiting the president's salvation. Other major domestic and foreign policy issues are also complex and difficult to resolve. Taking office at this time carries immense responsibility. Therefore, Mr. Roosevelt told people at the Mayflower Hotel last night that if he does not have a solid and good plan during his term to rescue the people from their troubles, he may become the most criticized president in history. (4th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt is preparing to take immediate action to relieve the financial crisis. He discussed it with his advisors until after midnight last night, and President Hoover also discussed it with leaders of the old government until late at night. The new and old Treasury Secretaries, Woodin and Mills, held secret meetings with Mr. Roosevelt's chief financial advisor, Molay, and the entire board of the Federal Reserve System until 3:00 AM this morning.

<h3>The US Financial Crisis Spreads Across the Nation</h3>
<p>New York and Chicago Are Also Engulfed in the Whirlpool. Congress Grants the President Economic Dictatorial Powers. US Money Flows into Canada in a Steady Stream.</p>
<p>(New York) Panic in the American banking industry is developing very rapidly. Banks in North Carolina and Virginia have been allowed to restrict withdrawals. The Governor of Kansas has decided to limit cash withdrawals at banks within the state to 50%. Missouri today announced a two-day bank holiday. New York sources estimate that the United States lost 116 million gold dollars yesterday alone. Thousands of people in New York's most densely populated Bowery area withdrew funds from the Bowery Savings Bank, withdrawing a total of 400,200 gold dollars.

<h3>US New President Roosevelt</h3>
<p>(New York) The banks of the two largest financial centers in the United States were finally engulfed in the financial turmoil and announced the closure of the market last night. The Governor of Illinois first ordered the closure of banks in this state for three days, and the Governor of New York followed suit and also announced the closure of the market for three days in both states</p>
<p>This order was issued after the banks closed, which was quite unexpected to the general public. It was decided after a long period of consultation between the authorities and financial leaders, who felt that the situation was extremely serious and that it was necessary to close the market before issuing the order. The current financial turmoil has now spread throughout the country, but even bank experts cannot be sure of the cause. Although it initially started in Detroit, Detroit seemed to have calmed down when the turmoil occurred in other cities. Today, it is generally recognized here that the turbulence will force all states to restrict withdrawals or announce closures before stopping. However, in most places, restricting withdrawals is sufficient. As for New York's closure order, the mayor convened financial leaders to discuss the matter from 10:00 PM to 2:00 AM the next morning before deciding to issue the order.

Out of 18,000 banks across the country, 3,000 have announced closures or restrictions on withdrawals. London bankers, out of caution, have temporarily suspended foreign exchange trading today. However, the London Stock Exchange received the news from the United States very calmly.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago today increased the rediscount rate to 3.5%. (4th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Economist Considers Serving as Envoy to China</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is now believed that the new US government will sacrifice foreign affairs experts from the State Department to meet political needs. According to sources close to the new president, Mr. Roosevelt is currently considering appointing Strauss, a well-known New York tycoon and banker, as the envoy to China. Mr. Strauss has always been involved in commerce and banking and has never had a distinguished reputation in private organizations researching foreign affairs. However, Mr. Roosevelt believes that in the coming years, world diplomacy will largely focus on adjusting the economy. Therefore, many prominent figures in the economic field are appointed to important official positions. The claim that Mr. Strauss will be the envoy to China has not yet been verified. It is said that changes in diplomatic personnel will be announced no earlier than ten days after the inauguration. Mr. Strauss is a graduate of Harvard University, serving as the chairman of Macy's, the largest retail store in New York, and a director of several banks and New York Life Insurance Company. He has led the unemployment relief movement and is currently 61 years old. (3rd, National News dispatch)</p>

<h3>Heaviest Damage in Kamaishi</h3>
<p>Entire Town Leveled</p>
<p>Wails of Women and Children, Pungent Odor of Corpses</p>
<p>Kamaishi – A reporter, due to the complete destruction of Kamaishi Town by a massive wave and earthquake, leaving no trace of its original form, set out to inspect the tragic scene. Overcoming difficulties related to transportation disruptions, he finally arrived in Kamaishi Town at 10 PM last night, becoming one of the first news reporters to reach the area. The devastation of the town was beyond all expectations. Out of the entire town's 5,000 households, 1,000 had been washed away by the waves. Even those that remained were severely damaged. Residents, terrified of aftershocks, were forced to sleep outdoors in single layers of clothing in sub-zero temperatures of minus seven degrees Celsius, a truly unbearable sight. Rumors of another massive wave coming again were widespread, causing residents to tremble with fear. Men stayed up all night on guard, while women and children wailed. The entire city was without lights, forcing people to navigate in darkness, constantly assaulted by the stench of mud and the odor of the dead. The cries of fathers mourning their sons and wives mourning their husbands were too harrowing to bear. A young girl was seen digging in the debris with her bare hands, her face covered in tears. When the reporter asked her about it, she replied that her husband and son had both died here and she was trying to dig them out. Unable to ask further questions, the reporter moved forward and reached the coast, where he saw several collapsed houses with no one to clear them away. According to the refugees, residents felt the earthquake and immediately got dressed and sought refuge on the beach. Initially, no waves arrived, so they felt relieved. Unexpectedly, within moments, waves tens of feet high came crashing down like collapsing mountains and overturned seas, sweeping away many people. Those who remained scrambled to escape to the mountains. At the same time, fires broke out everywhere along the coast, and the power went out completely, leaving no way to escape. An unknown number of people were trampled to death. Massive waves continued to crash ashore four or five times every twenty to thirty minutes. The refugees only began to descend from the mountains gradually at 5 AM yesterday morning. Upon witnessing this tragic scene, they were at a loss for what to do. (4th, Electric Communication)</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing's Talk in Berlin En Route to His Post in Russia</h3>
<p>Says There is No Political Cooperation Between China and Russia</p>
<p>The Recent Actions of the League of Nations are Barely Satisfactory</p>
<p>Japan's Unrestrained Militaristic Ambitions</p>
<p>Economic Bankruptcy Inevitably Unavoidable in the End</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, Mr. Yan Huiqing, the chief representative of China to the League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva, passed through the German capital on his way to Moscow. A reporter from the National News Agency stationed in Europe met with him during his journey. Mr. Yan expressed the following opinions regarding the League of Nations: Mr. Yan stated that he was extremely satisfied with the recent attitude adopted by the League of Nations, but felt that it had been too slow at the beginning. However, he now felt it was admirable that the League was able to safeguard its own dignity. Recently, the League of Nations had organized an advisory committee to closely monitor the Far East situation and might take steps to ban the shipment of arms to Japan in the future. Mr. Yan continued, saying that he would be staying in Moscow on this trip to Russia and would have to return to China once in early spring. Regarding Sino-Russian relations, Mr. Yan stated that the friendly relations between China and Russia would naturally develop economically, but apart from that, there would be no other form of political cooperation. If there were to be any, it would have to be mediated by the League of Nations. Mr. Yan also expressed doubt as to whether Japan would ultimately withdraw from the League of Nations, but said, "Japan should indeed withdraw from the League of Nations." He then referred to the Rehe Incident, stating, "Japan may not cross the Great Wall in the near future, but it is difficult to predict when they will become more and more greedy as they eat more. How long will it take for Japan's appetite to decrease slightly due to indigestion? As far as my personal observation is concerned, Japan will soon collapse due to economic bankruptcy."

<h3>Matsuoka's Aims in Europe</h3>
<p>Claims to be Experiencing the Political Atmosphere</p>
<p>Arrogant and Insufferable</p>
<p>(Berlin) Matsuoka, the chief representative of Japan to the League of Nations, told a guest here today that Japan would withdraw from the League of Nations in a few days, but the Cabinet's decision on this matter was still awaiting approval from the Privy Council. In short, if Japan did not withdraw from the League of Nations, the Cabinet would resign. One of the two must occur. The guest asked whether the islands in the Pacific Ocean under Japanese mandate would be returned to the League of Nations when Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in the future. Matsuoka replied no. The islands were given to Japan by the Allied Powers as a reward for Japan's war exploits. Japan occupied the islands before the League of Nations was established, and its mandated rule was only a formality to acknowledge Japan's ownership. As for his trip to The Hague and Berlin, it was purely for personal matters and had nothing to do with Japan and the Netherlands signing a non-aggression treaty. He knew nothing about this matter. He was not a diplomat, and he personally felt that the world would be better off without diplomacy. Matsuoka also said that he was very satisfied with the progress of the Japanese-Manchu troops in Rehe. If the League of Nations had ordered the Chinese troops to withdraw from Rehe earlier, this kind of war could have been avoided, and China's face could have been saved. As for future developments, it all depended on China's attitude, because Japan did not want to cross the Great Wall and invade mainland China. If the attitude of the League of Nations made China's backbone stronger or continued to cause disputes, Japan would be forced to take matters into its own hands. Matsuoka concluded by saying that one of the purposes of his trip to Berlin was to visit his old friend Dr. Solf and to experience the German political atmosphere, especially during the elections.

<h3>Negotiations for Deferred Payment of Boxer Indemnity</h3>
<p>Italy Expresses Agreement with England and France in Taking Unified Actions</p>
<p>England and France Have Not Yet Replied to Our Note</p>
<p>Related Organizations and Schools are Deeply Concerned</p>
<p>(Nanjing) For the continued suspension of payments for the Boxer Indemnity for one year, the Foreign Ministry addressed the British, French, and Italian ambassadors in China, who are directly involved, and also consulted with the designated use and management agencies in various countries. The Italian ambassador replied that the Italian government expressed agreement with England and France in taking unified actions, but the British and French ambassadors have not yet responded. The Ministry of Education has received urgent telegrams from universities in North China for several days asking for confirmation of the truth, especially Qinghua University, which relies on Sino-American Boxer Indemnity funds to maintain its school expenses, which is the most panic-stricken. Others, such as the National Beiping Library, the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute, the Social Survey Institute, and the National Language Unification Society, are also related to the Boxer Indemnity. In the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, there is also a relationship between the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese committees of various universities in London, from which 265,000 pounds and 200,000 pounds are allocated from the total amount of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity. The Ministry of Education believes that this matter is of great importance, but has not yet received a formal expression from the financial authorities, so it is currently unable to respond. However, if the suspension of the Boxer Indemnity is implemented and the financial authorities have not raised any funds to compensate, the impact on the future of education when the maintenance funds for the aforementioned schools and groups are used will be very large.

<h3>Siamese Tax Bureau Detains Party Certificates</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to news from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, 979 party certificates of Kuomintang members sent to the Qiongdao Association in Bangkok, Siam, were detained by the tax bureau and sent to the police department for review. It is not known what will happen to them. Before the change of government in Siam, the tax bureau had received party certificates sent from China, sent them to the police department for review, but had not seen how the police handled them, and had only confiscated the party certificates. When the Chinese Kuomintang was in the old government, it applied for registration once, but the authorities did not approve the request. The content of the Chinese Kuomintang is not left or right with the Siamese Kuomintang, and there are no illegal actions. Now that the People's Party has gained considerable authority in Siamese politics, it is expected that there may be a new understanding of this matter. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Disarmament Conference Reaches Stalemate</h3>
<p>British and French Prime Ministers to Personally Intervene</p>
<p>The Five-Power Conference Becomes Noisy Again</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference is currently at a standstill, awaiting new directives from the new U.S. President after he takes office. Amidst this pause, the convening of a Five-Power Conference is now becoming noisy again. It is generally felt that the Disarmament Conference has reached an impasse and that only a Five-Power Conference can overcome the current difficulties. However, whether the Five-Power Conference can actually take place is also a question, as France still intends to include its allied countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Romania. If this is the case, the Five-Power Conference will inevitably expand into a Nine-Power Conference, and France will be able to manipulate everything and command as it pleases.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd - The Cabinet held a meeting today, where Eden, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who had rushed back from Geneva, reported on the tense situation at the Disarmament Conference. As a result, it was decided that Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon would personally travel to Geneva. After the Cabinet meeting, an official statement was released, stating that the British government believes it is necessary to exert every effort to assist the Disarmament Conference so that it can reach a resolution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 3rd - Geneva believes that the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary's decision to come here is an indication that Britain intends to propose practical measures to help the Disarmament Conference escape its current predicament. The issue of proportional reduction of military personnel also caused a stalemate in the General Disarmament Commission today. French representative Paul-Boncour stated that France is not prepared to discuss troop levels until there is further progress on the issues of international guarantees and security. German representative Nadolny decided to express great dissatisfaction with the delay in the issue of troop levels. Nadolny cited President Hoover's call for genuine disarmament and lamented the Disarmament Conference's inability to reduce even a single soldier, gun, ship, or aircraft. However, Chairman Henderson stated that he is confident that tangible progress will be made soon.</p>
<p>National News, Geneva, 4th - Shortly after the announcement of the British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon's joint visit to Geneva, news came that French Premier Daladier would also arrive here within the next week. Many view this as a hopeful sign that the reconvening of the Five-Power Conference will be successful. France seems to have abandoned its original objections because the Little Entente countries and Poland have taken a negative attitude towards certain motions submitted by France to the Disarmament Conference. France fears being completely isolated. As a result of yesterday's developments, the Disarmament Conference has regained its vitality, especially on the French side, as it believes that Premier Daladier will be able to gain British cooperation and implement the French plan.</p>
<h3>Political Committee Discusses European Mutual Assistance Plan</h3>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 4th - The Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference met this morning, chaired by Henderson. The meeting discussed the European Mutual Assistance Plan. French representative Paul-Boncour pointed out that the Mutual Assistance Plan is one of the main points of the French plan. The concept of mutual assistance has already been included in the League of Nations Covenant, but it is not sufficiently clear. Therefore, it is supplemented by the "Prohibition of Resort to Force" passed by the Disarmament Conference. It is also necessary to define "aggressor" in order to be complete. Regarding the definition of "aggressor," Paul-Boncour advocated using the Soviet representative's proposal as the basis for discussion. In conclusion, Paul-Boncour asked the Political Committee to decide on the principles of mutual assistance itself. Spanish representative Madariaga advocated for universal land, sea, and air disarmament and supported the French proposal, namely using the Soviet proposal as the basis for discussion for defining "aggressor." The Soviet representative rose to thank the French and Spanish representatives for supporting the Soviet plan for defining "aggressor" and stated that this definition should be applied throughout the world. Yugoslav representative Fotic, representing the Little Entente countries, declared that the meaning of "mutual assistance" should be interpreted as broadly as possible. After the representatives of Czechoslovakia and Persia spoke, German representative Nadolny expressed reservations regarding the applicability of the European Mutual Assistance Plan, especially regarding the existence of local groups, which could bring back the pre-World War alliance situation to the present day. He also expressed reservations regarding the situation where one of the signatory countries of the European Convention attacks another signatory country. At the end of the meeting, the delegations of Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Finland jointly submitted a draft resolution as follows: "The Political Committee decides to accept the principle of the Mutual Assistance Convention and to establish a subcommittee to prepare the text of the convention as soon as possible for submission to this committee for discussion." The Political Committee is scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday for discussion.</p>
<h3>German Armed Election</h3>
<p>Government Uses Relief Food to Win Over Voters</p>
<p>Political Disturbances Occur in the West</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 3rd - The German government is now generously providing food relief to the most impoverished areas of Germany, which have traditionally supported the Social Democratic and Communist parties. Left-wing extremists are highly suspicious of this move, believing that its sole purpose is to win over the voters. The government recently ordered the distribution of 10,000 tons of butter and 35,000 tons of rye by local officials in Upper Silesia, Thuringia, the Ruhr, East Prussia, and Berlin to the poor. On Sunday, election day, troops will line up in front of President Hindenburg to show respect. 25,000 members of the Steel Helmet organization will participate in brown uniforms and will also hold a slight parade.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cologne, 4th - Political disturbances occurred in western Germany last night. Communists hid in houses and fired at members of the National Socialist Party, resulting in deaths and injuries. Seventy people with connections to the incident were arrested in Düsseldorf. Thirty-five people were also arrested in Cologne.</p>
<h3>European Intrigue and Competition</h3>
<p>After the Establishment of the Balkan Little Entente</p>
<p>The Baltic States Will Also Unite</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 3rd - The Baltic Sea countries may also unite, similar to the Little Entente. This situation is causing concern in German political circles. Well-informed German sources believe that the news circulating about this matter is very serious. At a time when disarmament negotiations in Geneva are becoming difficult, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia suddenly intend to compromise with each other and form a strong union outside of the Little Entente and Poland. This situation is causing great anxiety in German diplomatic circles. The Soviet Union's new policies, as well as the signing of non-aggression treaties between France, Poland, and the Soviet Union, are also the reasons for the German diplomatic community's anxiety. Germans view the Soviet Union as no longer being pro-German. The reason for the Soviet Union's attitude towards Germany is the influence of Germany's new internal policies. This is well understood by the general public.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Nanning: To all newspaper offices. Having read the telegram from Chairman Zhang Hanqing and the generals, we share the same grief and are deeply moved. We admire their patriotism. Since the Mukden Incident, over a year has passed, and our territory has not been recovered. The Japanese aggression is increasing, and they are now forcing their way into Shanhaiguan and attacking Rehe, baring their teeth and claws, greedy and insatiable. If Rehe is lost, North China will fall, and the whole country will be shaken. At this critical juncture, as the telegram states, only armed self-defense can save the nation from peril. We should all uphold this principle, rise up together to resist Japan, and hope that the generals at the front will persevere to the end, fight bravely, and prefer to die as jade rather than survive as tiles. Although Guangxi is remote, we will follow your lead. This telegram is impassioned, and we await your call to arms. Presented by Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>The Mechanization of Soviet Agriculture (Part 1) Soviet Correspondence (January 15th)</h3>
<p>During the First Five-Year Plan, enormous changes took place in the Soviet countryside, namely the mass collectivization of peasants. However, the Soviet Union inherited the legacy of Tsarist Russia, where the small-peasant economy dominated the national economy, and production technology was backward. This posed a tremendous difficulty for the socialist economic system. However, this tremendous difficulty has been largely overcome during the Five-Year Plan period.</p>
<p>According to reliable statistics at the end of 1932, 60.5% of all farmers in the Union had been collectivized, i.e., 14.5 million peasant households had joined collective farms, and about 80% of the sown area had been socialized, i.e., belonging to state-owned farms and collective farms. But we know that the collectivization of peasants is inseparable from the mechanization of agricultural production, because without improvements in production technology, large-scale operations are difficult to sustain economically.</p>
<h3>The Development of the Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Industry</h3>
<p>Before describing the mechanization of agriculture, let's talk about the development of the Soviet agricultural manufacturing industry. In the era of Tsarist Russia, the so-called highest record for the amount of agricultural machinery manufactured in 1913 was only 70 million rubles. Most of these manufacturing plants (accounting for 88.6% of the total) were small handicraft factories. Subsequently, World War I broke out, and by 1915, production had decreased by two times compared to 1913. From then until 1920, it continued to decline.</p>
<p>In the Soviet era, the development of its agricultural machinery manufacturing industry can be divided into two phases: one of renovation and one of construction. The renovation phase was during the period of national economic recovery, i.e., most of the large and small factories inherited from the old Tsarist Russia were merged and rebuilt. For example, the original 722 large and small factories have now been merged into only 40 factories. By 1926, their output had recovered to the pre-war level of 1913. The second phase was the era of the First Five-Year Plan. During this period, in order to realize the national industrialization policy and adapt to the needs of rural collectivization, the Soviet government paid special attention to the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry in the Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>This can be seen from the investment. In 1928, agricultural machinery and tractors accounted for 18.5% of the total investment. In 1929, it increased to 20.2%. In 1930, it increased to 25.2%. In 1931, it had increased to 31.3%. Among them, the particularly famous agricultural machinery manufacturing plants that were built include the Stalingrad Tractor Plant and the Kharkov Tractor Plant, which were completed in 1931. Each plant can produce 150 tractors per day. Another Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. It will be larger in scale and will be able to produce 200 tractors per day in the future. In terms of agricultural machinery, the Rostov Agricultural Machinery Plant was completed on January 1, 1931, with an annual output value of approximately 20 million rubles. The main products are tractor plows, seeders, harvesting equipment, harrows, and combine harvesters. The Saratov Combine Harvester Plant was completed in 1932, with an annual output value of approximately 130 million rubles, specializing in the manufacture of grain combine harvesters. The Tashkent Agricultural Machinery Plant was completed on January 1, 1932, with an annual output value of approximately 50 million rubles, specializing in the manufacture of cotton equipment. The Gorki Agricultural Machinery Plant was completed in 1931, with an annual output value of approximately 27.5 million rubles, specializing in the manufacture of mowing equipment for livestock feed.</p>
<p>Because the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry has had such a vast development, all the machinery needed for the mechanization of Soviet agriculture can be manufactured, and there is no need to import it from abroad anymore. This means reducing the Soviet Union's dependence on foreign countries.</p>
<p>It is especially worth noting that the development of the Soviet agricultural machinery manufacturing industry can not only manufacture general machinery but also complex machinery, such as combine harvesters. A combine harvester combines the functions of harvesting grain and threshing into one machine. For example, when harvesting wheat, one side harvests and the other side threshes in the field. The front end of the machine harvests the wheat, and the back end already produces wheat grains. This machine has the advantage of minimizing the loss of grains during harvesting. The unnecessary losses of grain during manual harvesting, such as bundling and transportation, can be avoided. In 1928, the Soviet countryside did not know about this kind of equipment. In 1929, four or five of these machines were imported from the United States. But now the Soviet Union can manufacture this machine in large quantities. At the beginning of 1930, there were 800 of these machines in the entire Soviet Union. By the end of the same year, the number increased to 1,620. In 1931, it increased to 6,000, half of which were manufactured domestically. In 1932, there were 17,000, of which only 3,600 were foreign goods, and the rest were all manufactured in the Soviet Union. Secondly, the total output of agricultural machinery in the entire Soviet Union was worth 215 million rubles in 1928-29. By 1932, it had increased to 400 million rubles. It has almost doubled in four years. Among them, the development of tractor manufacturing is particularly rapid. Before 1928, the Soviet Union manufactured a total of only 3,500 tractors. In that year alone, it manufactured 1,280 tractors. In 1929, it manufactured 2,267 tractors. In 1930, it increased to 14,250 tractors. In 1931, it increased to 38,083 tractors. In 1932, it further increased to 50,250 tractors. The development of the Soviet agricultural machinery manufacturing industry is thus imaginable.</p>

<h3>False Alarm of Bandit Boats Passing Through Songjiang</h3>
<p>The villages in the Xiaokunshan District have been ravaged by bandits almost every night. The Tangjiabang Wang Liuyuan family and the Wang Jingyun family were robbed one after another the night before last. Last night (the 3rd) at dusk, one Jiangbei boat and one rowboat were discovered in the Xujiaqiao River. The boats were heavily loaded, and there were three suspicious-looking people walking on the shore. The villagers, like frightened birds, knew that they were not good people when they saw the situation. They immediately rang the copper alarm. The three people walking on land, hearing the sound, were afraid of being surrounded and arrested, and boarded the boat one after another. Since then, the villages around Xujiaqiao River West in Xiaokunshan District, such as Dayoubang, Shenjiajing, Zhaozhuang, Xixian Village, and Yuewubang, have been ringing their copper alarms and watching each other with torches on the road. The bandit boats began to flee westward. It was already dawn. That night, the district reported an emergency to the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team via long-distance telephone. The Public Security Bureau dispatched Inspector Xu to lead a team to pursue them. It is not known whether they were captured or not.</p>

(3) The fundraising period is tentatively set at three months, but in view of the urgent situation at the border, the principle is to raise the full amount as early as possible. (4) After the various associations have raised funds, they will issue temporary receipts to shops or individuals. As soon as a certain amount has been raised, they will be remitted to the Jiangsu Bank in Zhenjiang for collection and exchange for the official general receipts of this association. This association will publish the amount raised by each association and the names of the contributors in the newspaper to show credibility. The above four items have been telegraphed to the county chambers of commerce to allocate quotas and actively carry out the fundraising. The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene a general meeting within days to earnestly solicit donations.</p>
<h3>Murderer Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Liu Baosheng, the son of Liu Gongshi, a widow in Pancun Village, District 17 of the county, was stabbed to death and his body was abandoned in a wasteland near the Jiangkou estuary. When the body was discovered, the county court dispatched police to arrest the suspects Liu Zhenhan, Xie Qiaogen, Xie Yucen, and Song Yansheng, a militiaman of the Zhouqiao Security Corps, who were interrogated and detained. After the investigation was completed, they were prosecuted according to law. After nine trials, Judge Wang Kequan opened the court yesterday and sentenced Liu Zhenhan to death for the crime of jointly plotting murder. Xie Qiaogen was sentenced to life imprisonment for the same crime with a reduced sentence. Song Yansheng was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Xie Yucen was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The private prosecution portion will be concluded separately in a civil trial.</p>
<h3>Three Cases of Robbery in Urban and Rural Areas</h3>
<p>The home of Lu Huiling, the head of Liujia Dang Township in the Fifth District (Tianshang City), was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits in the deep of night the day before yesterday, who wantonly looted gold jewelry, clothes, and silver dollars, worth about eight or nine hundred yuan. The home of Zhang Shishi, who looks after the tomb of scholar Chu in the Second District, was also robbed the night before last, with a loss of thirty or forty yuan. In addition, Tu Xinshu, an engineer of the Shenxin No. 3 Sand Factory who lives outside the West Gate, was robbed of a gold ring and more than ten silver dollars by bandits on the road at around 2:00 AM yesterday (the 4th).</p>
<h3>A False Alarm While Arresting Thieves West of Changzhou City</h3>
<p>In Fangjia Village, Guangfu Township, District 14 of Wuyi County, about one mile from the city and about the same distance from Chendu Bridge Town, a group of canal workers dredging the new southern canal went to the village one evening three days ago around eight o'clock to cut down mulberry trees for firewood. This led to a dispute with the villagers, which escalated into a fight. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the villagers beat gongs to gather a crowd. The Chendu Bridge militia, hearing the alarm, were unsure of what was happening in the darkness, suspecting a robbery. They immediately assembled their forces, carrying guns and firing along the way, trying to apprehend the thieves. At the same time, the Second Police Precinct outside the West Gate also received the alarm, but they were also uncertain of the situation. The western merchant militia, fully armed, also followed to capture the robbers. When the two sides finally met, they realized it was a misunderstanding. The Chendu Bridge militia had fired over a hundred shots. The nearby villagers, feeling as if they were facing a major enemy, were all greatly alarmed.</p>
<h3>Small Steamer Sinks After Hitting Reef in Changshu</h3>
<p>The Yongyuan steamer of the Tai Dong Bureau, towing the Yongli boat, etc., fully loaded with goods, was sailing from Shanghai to Changshu the other day. There were only forty-four passengers on board. Unexpectedly, while passing through the Qinyang Port at Ergangkou near Xiadun, it was already midnight, and a fierce wind was blowing, making it difficult to discern directions. Due to a moment of carelessness, they struck a collapsed boulder in the area. River water rushed in. The tugboat, seeing the accident, immediately cut the towline. Before long, the ship completely sank, with its cargo going to the bottom of the river. Fortunately, all the passengers were on the tugboat and were unharmed. They anchored there for the night and arrived in Changshu on the morning of the third. They telegraphed Shanghai to notify them. At the same time, because the sunken ship has not been salvaged, there are concerns that it will block the waterway, so scheduled boats are not running.</p>
<h3>Tragedy at Market in Jiangyin City Results in Many Deaths and Injuries</h3>
<p>Due to the lunar calendar second month eighth day, commonly known as the birthday of Zhang the Great, farmers from the surrounding villages gathered at the Shifang Nunnery outside the south gate to buy and sell farming tools. Yesterday (the 3rd) at around 3 PM, due to overcrowding, the railings of the Wu Jia Bridge were broken, resulting in the immediate death of a 55-year-old woman, Tang He-shi. The injured were He-shi's 76-year-old mother, Tang Zhang-shi, as well as Chen Cao-shi, Li Shun-gen, Tao Kun-tian, and Yu A-gou. They were taken to the Gospel Red Cross Hospital for treatment and are not expected to be in mortal danger.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Muslims Request Lifting of Cattle Slaughter Ban</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Muslim Religious Council stated that since the floods and wars in Jiangsu Province, the authorities, in order to focus on cultivation and harvesting, had issued an order banning the slaughter of cattle. However, nearly two years have passed, and beef merchants have suffered severely from unemployment, and Muslims are particularly concerned about the lack of food. Therefore, at yesterday's plenary committee meeting, it was decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Interior and various departments of the provincial government, requesting the relaxation of the ban to maintain the livelihood of the people.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Three People in Fuling, Shaoxing</h3>
<p>In Fuling, a northern town of Shaoxing, Zhao Zhifeng, who operates a business in Shanghai and has a modest but comfortable life, was targeted by bandits. On the evening of the first of this month, six or seven bandits suddenly broke into his house, kidnapping his eldest son, Zhao Bingran, and two of Bingran's nephews (A-shui, 17 years old, and Qi-neng, 15 years old), and taking them away by boat towards the Liushisanda Bridge. Afterwards, the nearby Doumen police station was informed, and they reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau by telephone, who ordered the detective team to investigate.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Returns to Hometown to Sweep Tombs</h3>
<p>Central Committee member and Gansu Province Chairman Shao Lizi, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Fu Xuewen, returned to his hometown this time. On the second, he went to Baita Tou, Taoyan, to pay respects at his ancestors' tombs. On the third, he went to Yangjia, Taoyan, to pay respects at his father's tomb. On the fourth, he inspected his mother's grave site on Fucheng Mountain. On the fifth, at the invitation of the county party headquarters, he gave a public lecture at the People's Stage. It is said that he will not stay long in his hometown and plans to leave Shaoxing for Hangzhou on the sixth or seventh, then travel to Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>55th Division of Hefei Transferred to Jiangxi to Suppress Communists</h3>
<p>The various units of the 55th Division stationed in Hefei and along the Luhe line have now received orders from the Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Suppression in the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces to transfer to Jiangxi to participate in the suppression of the Communists. The abandoned defense areas will be filled by the 12th Division of the Third Army. The 55th Division has seized dozens of civilian boats to transport military supplies, clothing, and ammunition in recent days, and has ordered the units along the Luhe line to concentrate in the city immediately in order to depart.</p>
<h3>Organizing the Chaohu Boat Tax Management Committee</h3>
<p>Since the Chaohu Water Police Bureau moved to Zhongchao and implemented lake patrols, expenses have increased sharply. For the purpose of subsidizing the expenses, the Chambers of Commerce of Hefei, Chaoxian, Shucheng, Lujiang, Sanhe, and Taozhen have jointly formed the Chaohu Boat Tax Management Committee, each electing one member to manage the donation matters. It was decided to establish three boat tax collection offices in Chaoxian, Sanhe, and Yuxikou. Twelve articles of association were drafted and submitted to the Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Second District for forwarding to the Department of Civil Affairs for record and implementation.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Discusses He Yingqin's Flight to Peiping</h3>
<p>Li Liejun and Huang Shaohong Accompanied Him</p>
<p>He Was Sent by the Central Government to Take Charge of Military Affairs</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, along with Legislative Yuan members Fu Bingchang, Lu Guang, and others, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing at 11:20 PM the night before last. They came to participate in the final meeting of the preparatory committee for the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Institution, to discuss various closing matters, and regarding the various necessary preparations for the inauguration ceremony of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Institution to be held in Nanjing on the 12th. Newspaper reporters went to Mr. Sun's residence on Columbia Road at 11 AM yesterday morning for an interview. The following is a record of Mr. Sun's remarks:</p>
<h3>Reasons for Resignation of Three Representatives</h3>
<p>The reporter first asked about the reasons for the resignation of our country's three representatives to the League of Nations. Mr. Sun replied that the three representatives of our country to the League of Nations had telegraphed Nanjing their resignations, which the central government persuaded them to withdraw, and the matter is no longer an issue. As for the reasons for the resignation, it is because of China's current situation, which emphasizes military resistance. Diplomatic activity is relatively less important. The resignation of the three representatives clearly expresses the need to awaken a unified determination within the country to resist Japan, and not to harbor any hope for peace, thereby plunging the nation and its people into an irrecoverable abyss.</p>
<p>The Situation in Rehe and North China: Mr. Sun also said that regarding the war in Rehe, in terms of weapons and various equipment, we are inferior to the enemy. In terms of attack and defense, and the strategic importance of the terrain, defense is easier than offense. Therefore, whether Rehe can be defended completely depends on the determination of the military commanders in the north and whether the soldiers are willing to fight.</p>
<p>The Government Will Provide as Much Support as Possible: As for the issue of financial and material support from the central government, it will try to raise funds and transport them to the front lines as much as possible. Financially, the financial authorities are already making arrangements. Other aspects, due to inconvenient transportation, have slightly difficult transportation. This is the result of not paying enough attention to national defense in the past, leading to the pain of "temporary solutions" today.</p>
<p>He, Huang, and Li Flew to Peiping the Day Before Yesterday: Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, Minister of Interior Huang Shaohong, and Central Committee member Li Liejun flew to Peiping the day before yesterday morning. It is said that they were sent by the central government to take charge of military affairs. As for whether they will go to the front lines to supervise the battle, it will be decided after arriving in Peiping. Regarding the question of Chairman Chiang's personal trip to the north, since the central government officials in charge of military affairs have already gone to Peiping, there is no news of Chiang's temporary northern trip.</p>
<p>Do Not Fall for the Japanese Divide-and-Conquer Plot: The reporter also asked about the news of the defection of Commander Dong on the Rehe front to the enemy. Sun said that he could not confirm this statement. He heard that Tang Yulin and Commander Dong had very deep opinions in the past, but he believed that during this critical military period, they would never harbor any resentment. As for the claims that Sun Dianying surrendered and that Rehe and Tang reached a compromise, these are purely Japanese divide-and-conquer policies and should not be easily believed.</p>
<p>The Preliminary Draft of the Constitution: Mr. Sun also stated that regarding the drafting of the constitution, the Constitutional Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan has set a period and is proceeding step by step. As for the principles of the preliminary draft, they were approved at a meeting the day before yesterday, but these are hypothetical principles and will need to be formally studied and the opinions of experts from across the country will be sought.</p>
<h3>The Product Exhibition Will Announce Its Closing Tonight</h3>
<p>The Return of Exhibited Items Will Begin on the Seventh</p>
<p>Exhibitors Telephoned the U.S. to Reserve Our Venue</p>
<p>The Product Association Will Be Officially Established Today</p>
<p>Today is the last day of the Chicago Expo Product Exhibition, which will close at 7 PM tonight. It has also been decided that the return of all exhibited items will begin on the 7th. The exhibitors have decided to participate on their own, and have telephoned the U.S. to reserve the Chinese pavilion venue. They have also decided to formally establish a product association today. The U.S. side also telegraphed Shanghai to inquire about the suspension of participation. The Review Committee had a pleasant banquet last night, and the exhibitors specifically went to petition for assistance. The details are divided and recorded below.</p>
<p>All Exhibited Items Will Be Displayed: Because today is the last day of the Product Exhibition, all of the fine items that arrived later from various places were displayed as much as possible yesterday for viewing. Although it rained yesterday, the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life to attend the exhibition broke the record for the exhibition period. Schools were especially numerous, including Shanghai University, Sino-French Industrial College, Jinde Girls' High School, Chongde Girls' High School, Luanxing Girls' High School, Wuben Girls' High School, Renhe Obstetrics, McLaren Middle School, Aiguo Girls' High School, Zhonghua Vocational High School, Siming Elementary School, Gongshi Middle School, Jingye Attached Elementary School, Danhua Elementary School, Huanguang Elementary School, Municipal Council Elementary School, Chinese Vocational Education Society, and over twenty other groups of over eight thousand people. They all walked slowly in orderly lines to visit, and the order was very good. Today is the last day, and it is expected that the crowds will be twice as large as yesterday.</p>
<p>Return of Exhibited Items Will Begin on the 7th: Because the conference has been ordered to suspend participation, in order to end the event as soon as possible, it has been decided to start returning all exhibited items on the morning of the 7th at 10 AM. It is planned to start with the exhibitors from this city. All exhibitors can bring their original receipts to the venue on Bailinan Road to pick up their items. As for how to return the exhibits from various places, it will be decided at a meeting. The issue of awards also needs to be discussed and resolved at a meeting.</p>
<p>The U.S. Telegraphs the Preparatory Committee to Inquire About the Truth: Preparatory Committee Chairman He Bingxian received a telegram from the U.S. from Dr. Albert, the special representative of the Chicago Expo in charge of contacting Chinese representatives, asking if it was true that our country had suspended participation, and the truth behind it, and asked for a prompt reply. After receiving the telegram, Mr. He immediately replied that the central government had decided to suspend due to the daily increasing national crisis, and there was no other reason. Please forgive him.</p>
<p>The Product Association Will Be Established Today: The exhibitors are very disappointed with the government's sudden suspension of participation. Therefore, they had a meeting the day before yesterday and decided to organize a product association to automatically participate in the United States. This afternoon at 2 PM, the association will hold a plenary meeting to announce its official establishment. Yesterday, the association also telegraphed the United States in the name of the exhibitors, asking them to reserve the Chinese pavilion association base in the conference hall so that they could participate in a personal capacity.</p>
<p>Appoint Representatives to Petition the Review Committee: At 7 PM last night, Product Review Committee Chairman Cai Yuanpei held a banquet for all the members of the Review Committee at the Huaan Building to celebrate the completion of the Review Committee's work and to discuss whether to continue reviewing the qualified products in order to issue awards. Upon hearing this, the exhibitors immediately appointed Wang Songyou, Wu Guangzhi, and others as representatives, intending to take this opportunity to go to the Review Committee members to petition for assistance, requesting them to continue to participate in the United States.</p>
<h3>Liu Chongjie Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>He Met with Song to Report on the Situation in North China</p>
<p>Liu Said: We Don't Need to Be Pessimistic, the Only Way Out Is Sacrifice</p>
<p>The League of Nations Will Help Us Depending on Our Resistance Strength</p>
<p>The Chiang Envoy to Japan Has No Diplomacy to Conduct and Will Return Home</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie recently returned to Nanjing from Peiping and reported to Minister Luo on the situation in North China after the inspection. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning to meet with Acting Premier Song Ziwen. In the afternoon, he also went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to review official documents. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency paid a special visit to Mr. Liu. The following is a record of his remarks:</p>
<p>Impressions of the Trip North: Mr. Liu first described his mission to Shanghai, saying that he was meeting with Acting Premier Song Ziwen to report on the situation in North China. He had also telegraphed Chairman Chiang a detailed account of the situation. He stayed in Peiping for nearly two months and had a good impression, but felt that the situation was becoming increasingly tense and that efforts should be redoubled to find a way out. Although the recent situation in the north cannot be said to be optimistic, there is no need to be pessimistic. We only need to continue our efforts, and we will eventually not fail the sacrifices of the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>Spirit of Sacrifice: I went to inspect Yuguan but did not go to Rehe. I deeply know that the soldiers at the front have a spirit of sacrifice. We must know that if we can sacrifice, we can receive some results internationally. The League of Nations must see the extent of our own efforts. Therefore, holding on to Rehe is a matter of life and death for our country. The soldiers at the front are hungry, cold, and suffering, which is something that we who live in the south cannot imagine. I hope that we will not fail their spirit of struggle.</p>
<p>Chiang's Envoy Returns Home: The resignation of the three representatives of our country to the League of Nations, Yan, Gu, and Guo, is to encourage the government, the soldiers at the front, and the people of the whole country to work hard to resist the enemy. As for Ambassador Chiang Zuo-bin's imminent return home, it is because Mr. Chiang has been in Japan for a long time and has long wanted to return home for a trip. Therefore, the central government approved his request. At this time when the Japanese are actively invading Rehe, Ambassador Chiang's stay in Japan has no diplomacy to conduct.</p>
<p>Embargo on Munitions: Regarding the British embargo on munitions to the Far East, Mr. Liu expressed that the embargo on munitions should not treat the aggressor and the aggressed in the same way. We only hope that all countries will have a fair attitude to promote the aggressor's realization of its wrongdoings. If the aggressor ultimately cannot realize its wrongdoings, then it is related to the survival of the League of Nations. Mr. Liu finally said that the public security of Peiping and Tianjin is not the biggest problem, unless the other side attacks us. In general, the situation is not the biggest problem. The Japanese said that we damaged the Boxer Protocol, but the Japanese occupation of Yuguan is the act of damaging Yuguan.</p>
<h3>When Premier Wang Will Return Home</h3>
<p>No More Than Twenty Days or So</p>
<p>The reporter recently visited Tang Youren and inquired about Premier Wang's return date. Tang said that he had not received any definite news recently, but it is expected that the return trip will be around the 17th of this month and that he should arrive in Shanghai. If there is a slight delay in the middle, it will ultimately be no more than twenty days or so.</p>
<h3>The National Federation of Commerce Elects to Send Representatives</h3>
<p>To Participate in the Russian Inspection Delegation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to inspect Soviet Russian Commerce, has a delegation to Russia for that purpose. Yesterday, the National Federation of Commerce specifically sent a telegram to the Ministry to approve one of its representatives to join the delegation. The original telegram reads, "To the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Nanjing, recently approved the telegram from the Suiyuan Provincial Government, to the National Federation of Commerce, that the Soviet Russian Five-Year Plan for Industry has made great progress, which has attracted worldwide attention. After the restoration of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations, industrial and commercial circles are promoting the organization of a Soviet Russian Industrial Inspection Group. Shanghai already has such an organization, recruiting people from all walks of life to participate, together to conduct on-the-spot investigations. Suiyuan Province is adjacent to Soviet Russia, and all goods have more transactions. The provincial government intends to send one person to participate, and order the Suiyuan Provincial Federation of Commerce to send one more person to participate together, (omitted below)." In order to understand the current state of Soviet Russian industry and to promote the progress of foreign trade, our association intends to send one representative to participate. This is to report to the Ministry for review and approval, which is very important. The National Federation of Commerce respectfully states."</p>
<h3>Discussing Organizing the Soviet Union Industry and Commerce Inspection Group</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation sent a letter to various factories yesterday, saying, "On February 9th of this year, at a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the federation, Committee Member Gu Jiuru temporarily proposed the organization of a Chinese Soviet Union Industry and Commerce Inspection Group, which was approved after discussion, and letters were sent to various factories, inviting them to participate freely, etc., recorded in the case. It is found that the Soviet Union was originally an agricultural country, but since the success of the Five-Year Plan for Industry, it has been transformed into an industrial country. Since China and the Soviet Union have now restored diplomatic relations, in order to promote the mutual sales of products between the two countries, it is appropriate to organize an industry and commerce inspection group to go to the Soviet Union for on-the-spot inspections, to serve as a model for the country to improve industry and commerce, and to provide great assistance to the trade between the two countries. Please check the case and reply immediately if you are willing to participate in the organization of the Soviet Union Industry and Commerce Inspection Group, so as to discuss with the leaders of the industry and commerce circles and achieve the goal."</p>
<h3>Liang Shiyi Discusses the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Plan</h3>
<p>The Financial Community Holds a Public Banquet Today</p>
<p>Shanghai News from the Shen Shi Telegraph Agency: After Mr. Liang Shiyi, former Minister of Finance of the Beijing government, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he made a statement as soon as he unpacked his luggage. He was brief and could not make a systematic and detailed statement. A reporter from the Shen Shi Telegraph Agency paid a special visit to Mr. Liang's private residence yesterday afternoon. When the reporter arrived at Mr. Liang's residence, Mr. Liang happened to have several friends, so Cen Xuelu, who accompanied Mr. Liang to Shanghai this time, received him into the room. The conversation about the customs and people of the southwest was very pleasant. Not long after, the guests left, and the reporter was invited into the reception room. Mr. Liang was dressed in a gray robe and black jacket, over sixty years old, but he was full of energy. He greeted the reporter and shook hands. After a brief exchange of greetings, the reporter explained the purpose of his visit and asked about the key points of resisting Japan and the rear supply. Mr. Liang immediately expressed his willingness to make a detailed statement, expressing his opinions in a continuous and fluent manner. His eloquence was admirable.</p>
<h3>Familiar with Military Affairs</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Liang, his mission to Shanghai this time is also the responsibility that all the people of the country should have. Who is not indignant about the Japanese invasion? Who is not a citizen? Seeing these difficult times, how can one not be angry? Therefore, his mission to Shanghai this time is to transfer to the north and participate in the resistance against Japan. As for the methods to start resisting Japan, everyone must do their best, so that there is a chance to save the country from danger. Although he is not a soldier, he has some knowledge of military science. During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, he served as the director of the Bureau of Military Supplies. Most of the various books taught at the former Baoding Military Academy were compiled by him. Although military equipment has been changing with each passing day, the only difference is the technical difference. The strategic tactics of attack and defense and the geographical situation have not changed at all.</p>
<h3>Japan's Plan for Rehe Is to Guard against Russia and the United States</h3>
<p>The Japanese army has already robbed our three provinces, and recently they are peeping into Tianjin and planning to seize our Rehe. By observing their intentions and their use of troops, we know that what they are fighting for is not the gains and losses of the moment, but the long-term defense after the gains, and to seize a solid and important base in advance to prepare against Russia and the United States. The Japanese attack on Rehe is divided into three routes, one from Jiuguan, one from Lingyuan, and one from Kailu, aiming to go straight to Chengde. Chengde is the provincial capital of Rehe. If Chengde falls, the whole province will be lost. Today, although the Japanese are attacking in three routes, the main force has always focused on the Kailu and Chifeng routes. From this, we can know that the Japanese strategic tactics are to be lasting, to occupy the geographically important points, because they turn back to Kailu from Yuguan or Jinzhou for more than eight hundred miles, with continuous mountains and lofty ridges, and a dangerous terrain. With this, they can defend firmly and not worry about the future Russo-Japanese War. One side can cut off the support of our army, and at the same time, it can cope with Russia's strategy. What he means by Japan's goal is to occupy Rehe for a long time. Since the Republic of China, internal wars have been frequent, but they have all aimed at defeating the other side's strength. The concept of geography is very fresh. Everyone knows that the strategy of war between countries is that it is not possible to last without taking dangerous passes exclusively. Rehe is a maze of mountains and valleys; tanks are ineffective and cannons cannot destroy the land. The only weapon that can be relied upon for combat is aircraft. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the best weapon to resist Japan is anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<h3>Dependency Should Be Eradicated</h3>
<p>The national crisis is deepening, and all parties in the country are united against the enemy. Recalling the fall of Keelung in Taiwan, it has been thirty-nine years. The scene at that time is just like today. After thirty-nine years, who will advocate for its recovery? Duan Hefei is sixty-nine years old this year. When he is eighty years old, it is doubtful whether the national crisis will be resolved, or it may be even more severe than it is today. Today, people of the country often place their hopes on the war between Japan and Russia or Japan and the United States in such a serious period of national crisis. Regardless of whether this future war will be beneficial to our country, it is sad that the people of the country show this inferior dependency. I often hear people say, "What is the situation between Japan and Russia? The deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States?" During the national crisis, they are still hoping for the help of neighboring countries, without knowing to rise up, implement national mobilization, and go to the national crisis together to save the country. What is the benefit of empty words to save the country? When Sun Ji was in the Guangxu thirty-second year, I read the publications of England and Germany, which deeply described the war situation. By the third year of the Republic, England and Germany were heard to have started the war. Today, the literary novels published in the United States are also the same. From this, we can know that the people of the two countries are so agitated that they are about to become unstoppable. Therefore, I speculate that a world war will inevitably break out, but people in general are all happy to believe that it is enough to sanction the Japanese invaders, without knowing whether they will first restrain Japan and then destroy China, or destroy China first and then restrain Japan, which is a mystery to the world.</p>
<h3>Supply Problem</h3>
<p>Although the current government is determined to resist Japan, I sincerely hope that the government and the people will become one. Without close cooperation between the front-line resistance and the rear-line supply, it will not be successful. The other day, Acting Premier Song Ziwen went north and issued 9 million national salvation treasury bonds in Tianjin, using 10 million treasury bonds as collateral. I have no other opinions to express on this. However, observing the huge number of military budget recently of the Japanese government is far too disparate to compare with only issuing millions in bonds, and so my opinion can be divided into methods to heal the symptom and methods to heal the cause. As for what heals the cause, it is all right to raise taxes to make up for the disparity, but the so-called raising taxes, although on the one hand it is hard on the country’s industry and commerce, taxes can be standardly extracted from the upper-middle class. For example, in the ninth year of the Republic, the government had already drafted income tax regulations, and if they are implemented, then it will not be a problem for ordinary civilians and young commerce. As for the symptom-healing method, it is necessary to wait until the nation's financial situation is clear before discussing and developing. Mr Liang resumed his plans to stay in Shanghai for a month or so, and would head north, and denied rumors that various parties invited him, because there was only one public contribution towards patriotism. At this, a guest arrived, and the reporter took his leave. At the door he met the former Railway Minister, Ye Gongchuo, who said that the recent talk of national mobilization was widespread, but few people in the country know what this means, because empty words to save the nation cannot save the nation, so he wants to send a message to the countrymen, not go abroad but visit domestically.</p>
<h3>Public Banquet of the Financial Community</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, various important people in the financial community of this city will hold a public banquet for Mr. Liang at the Bank of Communications today. The report yesterday that Mr. Liang will visit Duan Qirui today is absolutely untrue, because Mr. Liang said that he has been living in Hong Kong for a long time and has seen less. He must wait until he has seen and heard more and is familiar with the situation in all aspects before visiting Duan to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Local Associations Console Sun Dianying</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Local Associations sent two telegrams to Sun Dianying: (1) "To General Sun, Commander of Chifeng. We were honored to meet you in Chengde and hear your great views, which we deeply admire. We later encountered your troops on the road, and their military bearing was so disciplined that we knew they were an elite force. Upon arriving in Chifeng, you immediately achieved remarkable merits, which we were thrilled to hear. We hope you will continue to move forward and recover our territory. We are willing to promote your might and strive for support. We send this telegram to console you, hoping for your wise consideration. Yours respectfully, Mu Xiangyue and Huang Yanpei." (2) "To General Sun, Commander of Chifeng. Your troops took a detour to Rehe and endured great hardships. In the battle of Chifeng, you defeated a superior enemy force with fewer troops, thwarting their cunning plans. Your achievements are truly great. The news of your victory is like a long-awaited clearing of the clouds, which excites everyone. We hope you will continue your efforts and recover the lost land. Our association vows to do everything in its power to support you. We send this telegram to console you, awaiting more news of victory. Respectfully, the Shanghai Local Associations."</p>

<p>Changes Coming to American Personnel Stationed in China</p>
<p>According to the Continental Press, after the change of government in Washington today (the 4th), many of the American personnel stationed in China are expected to be replaced by Democratic figures sooner or later. However, the consular staff, whose qualifications are based on examinations and are not related to party affiliation, should not be affected. Even Minister Johnson, who is a specialist and has risen through the ranks, is unlikely to be replaced, although it is customary for American ambassadors and ministers abroad to retire with the president. However, in this time of emergency in the Far East, everything must rely on experienced personnel. Moreover, the new government will continue the existing American Far East policy. Therefore, several parties expect Johnson to be able to retain his position. However, the U.S. Court for China is likely to be entirely replaced by Democratic figures within a year. Even Judge Purdy, although a progressive Republican, is unlikely to retain his position after his ten-year term expires next year, as he will have reached retirement age. Since the Democratic Party has not been in power for a long time since President Wilson, most party members have been inactive for too long and are eager to move. Important officials in the court, such as prosecutors, wardens, and clerks, are likely to be replaced soon.</p>
<h3>Statement from the Volunteer Army Support Association Regarding Disbursement Procedures</h3>
<p>Letter to the Lawyers Association Clarifying Li Shirui's Case</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Lawyers Association yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, we previously read in the local news section of the February 24th issue of the *Shishi Xinbao* that your association sent a telegram to the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters regarding the case of Mr. Li Shirui, in which it was mentioned that Mr. Li embezzled funds from our association. We are grateful for your association's clarification, which aims to correct the public's perception. However, as this matter concerns the reputation of our association, it was resolved at the fifth board meeting to provide your association with a detailed account of the donation management and disbursement procedures. Donations to the Northeast Volunteer Army are collected by various public organizations, newspapers, and banks. Collection agencies that are not banks also transfer the donations they receive to banks. Therefore, all donations are stored in banks and managed by the custodial committee. The checkbooks of each bank are kept by Mr. Lin Kanghou, a standing member of the custodial committee. Each time assistance funds or advertising expenses are needed, the standing committee first fills out a request form, which is sent to the custodial committee. After the custodial committee approves and signs the check, the chairman of the supervisory committee, Mr. Pan Xulun, must also approve and stamp it. Only then can the standing committee stamp the check and remit or deliver the funds. The procedures are so strict that it is not possible for individual members of the standing committee to embezzle donations, nor is it possible for the entire standing committee to misuse donations. The total revenue and expenditure report for the 21st year has been published in the newspapers, with clear and transparent items and no secrets. We do not know where the embezzlement claim comes from. It damages individual reputations and attempts to undermine the national salvation movement, which is deeply regrettable. With a formidable enemy at our doorstep, there is no room for mutual suspicion. Facts speak louder than eloquence, and time will reveal the truth. Therefore, we provide this summary and hope for your understanding. Respectfully, to the Shanghai Lawyers Association."</p>
<h3>The Support Association Does Not Send People Out to Solicit Donations</h3>
<p>The war in Rehe is fierce, and there are occasional reports from the north. People in the South are enthusiastically donating, which is a good sign of unity. A certain large cinema, Mr. Lu, came to donate 50 yuan, saying that someone had previously visited the cinema to solicit donations in the name of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. It is not known whether this was genuine, so they sent the donation to clarify the truth. The cinema immediately telegraphed the Support Association, which stated that it had never sent anyone out to solicit donations. It is hoped that those who donate to the Volunteer Army in the future will send the donations directly to the major banks and obtain receipts. If there are any doubts, contact No. 29 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, telephone number 92016.</p>

<h3>After the Accidents at Zhengtai and Yonghe Factories</h3>
<p>The City's Rubber Workers Express Serious Concern</p>
<p>Five Resolutions Passed at an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Rubber Products Industry Labor Union of the First District of Shanghai believes that the successive tragic incidents at the Zhengtai and Yonghe factories have resulted in serious disasters and are of great importance. It convened a general meeting and organized a support association to handle the negotiations. Yesterday, the union held another emergency meeting,</p>
<p>resolving five cases and issuing a serious declaration, requesting all sectors to speak out for justice and provide assistance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Five Resolutions: Yesterday at 9:00 a.m., the union held an emergency meeting at its headquarters, chaired by Zhu Chengdong, to discuss various cases. (1) The two factories' inadequate equipment should be reported to the authorities for investigation, and those who managed the steam tanks should be held accountable as direct murderers, and the factory managers should be held criminally liable as indirect murderers. It was resolved to report to the local party and government authorities and telegraph to the central government. (2) The compensation for the deaths in the two factories does not comply with the legal definition of work-related injuries and deaths and cannot be based on the Factory Law, and the fact is not force majeure. The compensation should be calculated by averaging the deceased's age and living expenses to the age of sixty. It was resolved: (A) to seriously consider the matter with lawyer Le Lv, (B) to report to the central government, (C) to report to the local authorities, (D) to warn the responsible persons of the two factories. (3) The two factories should establish schools for the families of the deceased. It was resolved to request the authorities to order the factories to establish such schools. (4) All factories should implement labor insurance in the future. It was resolved to consult with each factory on this matter. Otherwise, if there are any accidents, the factories will be fully responsible. (5) Whether to conduct a detailed investigation into the situation of the families of the deceased in the two factories. It was resolved to assign comrades Zhu Chengdong and Xu Yuan to handle the matter together. (6) Whether to issue a declaration. It was resolved to assign Comrade Yuan Zhaoxin to draft the declaration. The meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>Issuance of a Declaration: Since the successive tragic incidents at Zhengtai and Yonghe, the people of Shanghai have been frightened and dismayed. The tragedy of life cannot be greater than this. This kind of disaster is due to the fact that the steam tanks, which could only withstand 30 degrees, were opened to 43 degrees and exploded. In fact, it was not unavoidable, let alone force majeure. Therefore, we should regard it as an indirect murder case, and we should not adhere to the legal perspective of considering it as a work-related injury and death. The government does not lack concern for the lives of the people, and there are many fair-minded people in society. This can be evidenced by the municipal government ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate thoroughly, and by the remarks in the supplement of the *Shenbao* on March 2 that factories should have safety equipment. This can also clarify that this situation is very different from the work-related injuries and deaths stipulated by law. Moreover, the dead are gone, and the living are like the remarks in the *Shenbao*, "To be honest, workers who work all day and night cannot even fill their stomachs, let alone talk about welfare. They also have to prepare to sacrifice their lives in vain." Although they are afraid, they cannot quit because they cannot bear the emptiness of their stomachs, which increases the hidden pain. As an organized organization of rubber workers in the city, this union has an unshirkable responsibility to maintain and care for them. Therefore, we dare to tell the society that the dead must be allowed to rest in peace, and the living must remove the obstacles to their lives. Those who manufacture tragedies must be made aware of their responsibility. The factories in this industry must have improvements that are trusted by everyone. Based on these four points, we vow not to yield to any power. We respectfully hope that all sectors will understand and speak out for justice and provide assistance. We are very grateful. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>After the Disasters at Two Rubber Factories</h3>
<p>Yonghe Resolved, Zhengtai Unresolved</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Telegraphed Municipal Government to Investigate and Verify</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Will Order Zhengtai to Handle the Matter According to Law</p>
<p>The case of the carelessness at Zhengtai Rubber Factory No. 1 on Tangshan Road and Yonghe Company No. 1 on Minsheng Road, which resulted in the burning and death of workers, has been ordered by the municipal government to be thoroughly investigated and reported by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the factories have issued compensation separately. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ordered to Investigate: After the Zhengtai factory tragedy occurred, the Central People's Training Committee telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to investigate and report. The municipal government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and report. The Ministry of Industry telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government the other day, ordering an investigation and verification, which was also forwarded by the municipal government to the Social Affairs Bureau for compliance. The Social Affairs Bureau has drafted improvement measures for the safety of rubber factories, which will be implemented by the factories after approval. However, the disasters at Zhengtai and Yonghe factories must be handled in accordance with Article 45 of the Factory Law, which stipulates that "in addition to the death of workers, a funeral allowance of 50 yuan should be given, and a compensation fee of 300 yuan and one year's average salary should be given to their families."</p>
<p>Yonghe Compensation: Yonghe Company No. 1 was negligent, burning and killing 18 workers. In addition to holding a memorial service, the company summoned the families of the deceased to negotiate compensation. In accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law, the company provided coffins and shrouds (each coffin cost 60 yuan, and shrouds, etc., cost 40 yuan), and each deceased was given a compensation fee of 300 yuan and two years' average salary of 300 yuan. The company transported the coffins of the workers back to their hometowns, and the affected families expressed their agreement, signed and resolved the matter, and reported it to the Social Affairs Bureau for record.</p>
<p>Zhengtai Compensation: Zhengtai Rubber Factory No. 1 was negligent, burning and killing 81 workers. In addition to holding a memorial service, the factory gave each deceased a compensation fee of 300 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau, because Zhengtai Factory refused to report, has ordered it to report within a time limit, and has also decided to strictly order the compensation for the burnt workers to be handled in accordance with Article 45 of the Factory Law.</p>
<h3>Record of the General Meeting of the Knitwear Association</h3>
<p>Seeking Members for the Aviation Association</p>
<p>Holding a Knitwear Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Knitwear Industry Association held a general meeting of members yesterday. All members attended, chaired by Ge Shengru. After the opening ceremony, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and discussed the proposal to raise donations for aviation and national salvation to purchase aircraft and strengthen national defense. It was resolved that all members unanimously approved it, and it was also resolved: (1) Organization: all executive and supervisory committee members of the association serve as solicitation committee members, and all member representatives serve as solicitation team leaders. (2) Solicitation methods: A, for employees and workers, according to the articles of association of the China Aviation Association, each person donates at least two yuan. If the monthly salary income is more than 20 yuan, 10% will be donated. This fee will be paid by the factory or store in one lump sum and deducted from their salary in four installments. B, factories and stores will donate one-tenth of their total business income last year (the 21st year), which will be paid next. (3) Publication method: The amount of donations received each day will be remitted by the association to the China Aviation Association,</p>
<p>designated bank, and sent to various newspapers for publication every day. After the donation is over, another credit record will be printed and distributed for review.

If anyone does not comply with the resolution of the association or dares to report the business volume and number of employees as more or less, once verified by the association, it will be announced in the newspaper and ordered to leave the association. Tianchan Hosiery Factory first recognized a donation of 200 yuan and asked all factories to actively contribute. Holding the Shanghai Knitwear Industry Products Exhibition was resolved that during the National Products Year, national products should be fully promoted. The association's move is really important and unanimously passed. The executive and supervisory committee appointed members to host the event. Finally, other cases were discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Five Japanese Warships Moored at Wusongkou and Shengshan Islands</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a sailboat from the outer sea to Wusong said that five Japanese warships were moored at Shengshan Islands outside Wusongkou. The reporter inquired about the Wusong Water Police authorities, who said that the warships had reportedly been anchored there for three or four days.</p>
<h3>Dredging the Liuh River in the War Zone</h3>
<p>The entire river flow is drained</p>
<p>Excavation will be carried out today</p>
<p>丨Ludu Bridge Convenes Foremen for Lectures丨</p>
<p>The Liuh River Haikou war zone river channel has been excavated by the Liuh River Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Dredging Committee. It is reported that the exact number of earthworks in the river has been</p>
<p>measured and dredged by the engineering department. Each worker in the Taicang section should dig 20.3988 cubic meters of earth. They are currently engaged in compiling and filling out forms and distributing them to each row for construction as planned. The association's branch office was originally divided into four locations: 1 (Kunshan) Taicang Nanmatou, 2 (Taicang), 3 (Jiading) Ludu Bridge, and 4 (Baoshan) Hejia Bridge. There have been slight changes. Because the Taicang section has the longest work section, for the convenience of command, the second branch office was moved to Nanmatou, and the original house in Ludu Bridge was changed to a branch office of the second branch office. Each place is equipped with a telephone to facilitate contact. The entire river flow has been very little remaining. The river bottom in shallow places has already protruded above the water surface. Within the next day or two, the entire river can be drained. Yesterday, the director of the association, Zhu Kai, convened a meeting at around 10:00 am and decided to start excavation on the 4th (ie today). The counties of Kuntai Jiabao have been notified to transfer the river workers to work as scheduled. All section foremen have reported for duty. The head of the engineering department of the association, Xia Hengzhi, specially convened all foremen yesterday and gave a lecture on the responsibilities of the foremen and the key points of the project at Ludu Bridge in order to show seriousness.</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Wusong-Hankou Pilotage Fee Issue</h3>
<p>The issue of pilotage fees between Wusong and Hankou has caused a major problem between Shanghai shipping merchants and the pilotage association. Further details are as follows:</p>
<p>Issue of Sovereignty: The Yangtze River pilotage business has been in operation for several decades. Initially, it was entirely staffed by Chinese people. However, with the opening of the country, foreigners were allowed to sail ships in the inland rivers. Without prohibiting their private pilotage, they even established associations and implemented a conspiracy to usurp the position of the host. Over the decades, the number of foreign pilots has increased, and the livelihood of Chinese pilots has declined. If a remedy is not sought quickly, foreigners will not only enter a no-man's land, but the relationship with national defense will also be deep and significant. The Ministry of the Navy believes that pilotage sovereignty belongs to territorial sea sovereignty. It is its duty to establish a pilot training center in the 20th year of the Republic of China to train qualified personnel with pilotage technology. A total of more than 300 people have graduated successively. Sent by the military department after passing the examination and issuing pilot licenses, the pilots organized an association, which was registered by the Ministry of the Navy, and its Wusong-Hankou pilotage regulations were also approved and implemented.</p>
<p>Pilotage Rates: What was reported yesterday was the original rate, which is not true. According to the person in charge of the association, the association's current pilotage fee has been the existing amount for more than ten years and is not newly established. There are also the Wusong-Hankou Leading River Company established by Europeans and Americans and the Yangyu River Pioneer Association of Japan in the Yangtze River. According to its price, it is several times higher than the association's existing amount. Equal duties, the price disparity, is intended to be re-ordered and slightly increased. The shipping merchants are deeply afraid that once it is realized, it is not what they want to hear. The United Pilotage Association is still discussing the fee increase in order to maintain their lives. As for the so-called special additional fee, this is a common practice in the shipping industry in various countries, which is convenient for the shipping company, not the pilot who sets up another name to ask for remuneration.</p>
<p>Captain and First Mate Concurrently Serving: According to the association, if the captain and first mate have sufficient pilotage experience, they can be executed in accordance with the provisions of Articles 6 and 14 of the Wusong-Hankou Pilotage Regulations.</p>
<p>Final Statement: The association finally stated that the term "Yangtze River Ship" mentioned in the report is actually referring to irregular coastal ships.</p>
<h3>Winter Tax Collection in the County is Overdue, and Strict Urging</h3>
<p>The County Finance Bureau Temporarily Postpones Mergers</p>
<p>The collection of winter tax grain for the 21st year in Shanghai County was not prosperous after the two-month deadline due to the impact of the Shanghai war and the decline of people's livelihood. The County Finance Bureau reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department and obtained approval to extend the winter tax deadline by 20 days to show consideration. Now the extension period has also exceeded the deadline for many days. The bureau checked the collection numbers and found that there were still huge amounts outstanding, and the Jiangsu Finance Department telegraphed repeatedly to urge the conclusion of the winter tax collection and settlement due to the provincial treasury's expenditure. The bureau ordered the collection officials in each district yesterday to quickly supervise the bundling industry in each district and urge them to complete the collection strictly within days in order to conclude the matter. Furthermore, the bureau had already been ordered to merge the county government on March 1 and set up departments to handle matters, but it has not yet been implemented. When asked about it yesterday, it was said that the bureau had received an order from the province to temporarily postpone the handover. However, the extension date was not specified, so the bureau is still working as usual.</p>
<h3>The Generous Donations of the Day Shift Workers of the Datong Steel Window Company</h3>
<p>The day shift workers of the Datong Steel Window Company Manufacturing Factory, in view of the urgent war situation, the people in the rear should do their best to donate in order to encourage morale, and generously donated 54 yuan and 7 cents from their wages and sent it to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. It is said that they still need to unite with the night shift workers and subscribe to monthly donations until the end of the military affairs against Japan. The workers of this factory can be said to be enthusiastic patriots.</p>
<h3>Achievements of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Reorganizing Shipping</h3>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was nationalized, Liu Hongsheng took over and spared no effort in reorganizing various matters. The four regular ships, Jiangshun, Jiang'an, Jiangxin, and Jianghua, which used to sail in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, were overhauled and completed one after another the other day. The four ships are among the best of the Yangtze River ships, with large hulls and solid equipment. Jiangshun and Jiang'an have a deadweight of more than 4,300 tons, and Jianghua and Jiangxin have a deadweight of more than 3,600 tons. Jiangshun, Jiang'an, and Jianghua each have eight special-class cabins, fourteen first-class cabins, and more than fifty second-class cabins. Jiangxin has nine special-class cabins, twelve first-class cabins, and sixty second-class cabins. Each cabin of each class can accommodate two people, with two bunks and one couch inside, with spacious locations and complete equipment. Now that they have been greatly repaired, they are even more brand new. This is only an improvement in material terms. The spirit of renewal, such as the accuracy of the round-trip schedule, the fixed seats for passengers, and the thoughtful service of the crew, is even more evident. And it has been negotiated with the military authorities to agree that the company's ships will not load soldiers along the way. In the future, the business will develop and can be controlled. Yesterday, He Molin, the head of the business department of the bureau, hosted a dinner on the Jiang'an ship for Chen Xiangtao, the president of China Travel Agency, Zhou Sizhong, the associate manager, Deng Bingquan, the director of the shipping department, and a group of five people, and led them to visit the various cabins of the ship. Chen and others said that they were satisfied and promised to introduce the various advantages to the company's passengers in order to achieve the effect of both parties working together.</p>

Ji and Wu were found not guilty. Wu refused to accept the verdict and appealed. The prosecutor of the Nightmare Trial also appealed against the acquittal of Ji and Wu. Yesterday, the Local Court specially dispatched bailiffs to bring out the three criminals, Zhang Wu and Ji, together with the case files, and escorted them on the Beijing-Shanghai express train to the Jiangsu Higher Court to await trial and verification.</p>
<h3>Head of the Political Department of the French Concession Police Station</h3>
<p>Sali Returns to Shanghai After His Vacation</p>
<p>Mr. Sali, the head of the political department of the French Concession Police Station, is a competent officer in the French Concession police and has served for several years with outstanding achievements. Mr. Sali took leave and returned to France last September. It is reported that his vacation has expired and he arrived in Shanghai on the French mail ship Botus yesterday. He will take a short rest and be back on duty next Monday.</p>
<h3>YMCA Organizes War Zone Service Committee</h3>
<p>In view of the increasingly serious war situation, the National Association of Chinese Christian Youth Associations has formed the Chinese YMCA War Zone Service Committee (referred to as the "YMCA War Committee") in accordance with its service to youth. The Executive Committee of the War Committee held a meeting on the 4th at 12:00 regarding the five issues of the Bank Association. Attendees included Liu Xian, Yan Fuqing, and executive committee members Zhang Jiapu, Chen Xiangtao, Chen Liting, Zhu Lide, Zheng Fuzhuo, Hao Boyang, Li Daonan, Li Yaobang, Zhan En, Li Zhaohuan, Bao Huigen, Shen Siliang, Zhao Jinlian, and General Secretary Liang Xiaochu. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Jiapu. The situation of the meeting is as follows: First, the General Secretary of the Association, Liang Xiaochu, reported the reasons for the YMCA's involvement in war zone services. (1) War zone service work, from the experience of the YMCA in various countries during the European War, has a great effect on boosting military morale. (2) The YMCA is an international organization, so the YMCA in China is involved in war zone services, which can give a deeper impression to the international community. (3) The YMCA has well-trained and experienced personnel. (4) The YMCA is a nationwide organization with great strength. (5) This war zone movement is a people's initiative. Mr. Liu and Yan reported on the situation in the front. As a result of the meeting, the front has a great need for war zone services, and the YMCA can make a great contribution to this service. Therefore, it was decided to implement war zone service work and cooperate with other agencies as much as possible within a considerable scope, and the following YMCA War Committee staff were selected: Chairman Zhang Jiapu, Vice Chairman Zheng Fuzhuo, Accountant Li Daonan, Secretary Yan Fuqing, General Secretary Liang Xiaochu, and Jin Shaowen was specially invited to be the director in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Various Charitable Organizations to Discuss Relief for Refugees</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations for Relief of Northeastern Refugees convened a temporary emergency meeting of all standing directors at its office in the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Xu Shiying, Wang Ting, Xiong Bingsan, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Aishi, Huang Bodu, Huang Hanzhi, Fan Guang, Gu Jisheng, and representatives from Du Yuesheng, totaling over ten people.

The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by Xiong Bingsan's detailed report on the tragic conditions of the North China refugees. The following resolutions were then discussed and decided upon: (1) Fundraising and relief methods; (2) Dispatching personnel to the north for disaster relief; (3) Sending letters to local organizations to continue widespread fundraising. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Winter Defense Period Ends, County Government Still Orders Intensified Precautions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County winter defense period ended at the end of February according to regulations. However, in light of the outbreak of the Rehe War, the escalating national crisis, and the importance of local defense, the county government, to prevent villains from taking advantage of the situation to cause disturbances, specially instructed all public security sub-bureau chiefs yesterday to intensify defense measures within their respective jurisdictions as usual, without any negligence, to maintain public safety.</p>
<h3>Taxi Association Submits Petition to City Government Yesterday, Requesting Assistance</h3>
<p>Exemption from Stamping Signed Paper Cases</p>
<p>Cannot Be Changed by Transfer of Authority</p>
<p>The Shanghai Taxi Trade Association submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday, stating that it was petitioning for assistance to the industry and requesting permission to forward the petition according to the facts to alleviate commercial difficulties. The petition stated that member companies of the association, including Xiang Sheng Li Li, Xin Zha Mei Hua Yi Tai Taxi Company, and China搬塲Company, had been following the notification from the association on June 13th, 1931 regarding the signed paper method, and had been operating peacefully without incident. Unexpectedly, on February 10th and 15th, the Tobacco and Alcohol Investigation Department of the concession, together with detectives, searched and confiscated the time-keeping and counting signed papers, etc. The situation at the time was tense, leaving no room for explanation or counting the number of items taken, resulting in an abrupt halt to operations. The association immediately requested that the confiscated items be returned, but after repeated attempts, no progress was made. Subsequently, on the 20th and 27th, they were summoned for trial to the 9th Division of the First Special District Local Court, where the detective's lawyer filed a public prosecution. The court disregarded the instruction issued on June 9th, 1931 by the Shanghai Special District Office of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol, stating that stamping was exempt, and based solely on the detective lawyer's one-sided story, fined Xiang Sheng Li Li 1,000 yuan each, Xin Zha 300 yuan, and ordered that all signed papers used by the industry in the future must be stamped without exception. Hearing the verdict, the association was deeply astonished. The member companies had been following the instructions of the association according to the directives and completing the procedures, so how could they be completely unprotected? These fines should be the responsibility of the association to provide assistance to avoid the fines and have the items returned, and to continue operating according to the original directives. Otherwise, if they are repeatedly investigated and fined, the industry will be unsustainable. This matter concerns survival, and the association accordingly requests investigation and action, so as to achieve the purpose of exempting from fines and returning the items, and to operate according to the original directives. Otherwise, if the industry is repeatedly investigated and fined, the consequences are unimaginable. This matter is a matter of life and death, and we respectfully request that you investigate and deal with it accordingly. According to this, the association previously issued notifications in accordance with the directives of the Shanghai Special District Office of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol, notifying the industry to comply. To date, no clear notification has been received, and no new regulations have been promulgated. Although the Special District Office is now responsible for transferring cases of violations to the Unified Tobacco Tax Investigation Department, how can the previously approved exemption from stamping be changed by the transfer of authority? Forcibly using signed paper as an important document and conducting indiscriminate investigations seems to be a case of divergent tax policies, which merchants and the public cannot bear. Moreover, when Chinese merchants are already struggling, further damage will inevitably lead to successive bankruptcies. Considering this situation, we sincerely fear that public sentiment will be agitated, and if an unexpected event occurs, it will have an impact on society. Therefore, we respectfully request your urgent permission to take action according to the circumstances and provide assistance, and also send representatives to explain in detail, and we humbly request you to examine and act accordingly, in order to maintain business and alleviate commercial difficulties, which is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to Shanghai Mayor Wu, Chairman of the Committee Zhou Xiang Sheng, Standing Committee Members Ruan Quan Hong, Zhou Pei Fu, Gu De Guang, Guo Shi Liang.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Federation of Twenty-Five District Associations</h3>
<p>Mediates Dispute Over Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax</p>
<p>The First District of the Shanghai Federation of Twenty-Five District Associations held an executive committee meeting yesterday. Zhang Yi, Ye Qichang, Guan Jichuan, and fifteen others, and summoned over sixty tobacco and alcohol businesses, including Yi Da, Wan Li, and Wan Kang. Wang Guoxian, director of the Commercial Affairs Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Sun Shouping, of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau, were in attendance. Chairman Chen Jiufeng reported, stating briefly that North Sichuan Road has historically been an area of extraterritorial construction, and there has never been a tobacco and alcohol license tax. Upon investigation, the license tax is indeed a tax-farming system. Last year, the tax farmers once sent personnel to forcibly collect the tax with police escorts, but the merchants all denied the obligation. From the January 28th Incident last year until now, business has plummeted, and the shops are deserted. Some, such as Tian Wan Li, are losing money every day, as verified by investigation and rare account books. This year, the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau has suddenly started to collect the tax, first sending police officers to forcibly collect the tax from various liquor and tobacco stores and arresting employees. The association has intervened and secured their release. Now, the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau still considers the national tax to be important and must be paid. Therefore, the members have been convened to discuss whether to acknowledge and pay the license tax. The members unanimously deny the obligation, stating that after the war, business is losing money, and even maintaining rent and expenses is difficult, and they propose that the tax bureau waive the tax. Once political power is recovered, the license can be reconsidered after the market recovers. Subsequently, Zhang Yichen and others spoke successively, urging payment, but the members firmly refused. Then, Sun Shouyu of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau urged compliance, saying that Director Huang of the tax bureau is very considerate of business difficulties and hopes that everyone will pay a little, only two yuan per store, and the other 30% supervision fee will be waived. Is this acceptable? After discussion on Monday, a response will be given next Thursday. After four hours of mediation, the principle was finally passed and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Two Skulls Broken Over a Single Copper Coin</h3>
<p>The mother of Li Aixin, resident of No. 205 Jiugudi, hired a rickshaw driven by Lin Tailai from the Sincere Company to return home at around 6 PM yesterday. They agreed on a fare of one dime. After being pulled to the destination, Li's mother gave two dimes and asked for change. Lin gave her 240 cash. Li Aixin thought that this could be exchanged for 500 cash, and asked for 25 copper coins in return. Lin refused. Li and the shopkeeper beat Lin. Unexpectedly, just as the shop was closing and putting up the signboards, five or six signboards fell, breaking the skulls of Lin Tailai and Li Aixin. Blood flowed like a fountain. Yang Yuhai of the 19th Garrison of the 1st Sub-Bureau of the 2nd District arrived and took the two injured people to the station for investigation. After questioning by Chief Shen, it was found that Lin Tailai was more seriously injured. He immediately scolded Li Aixin, saying that breaking your own and someone else's skull for a single copper coin was not worth it.

<h3>Kidnapping Ring Busted at Laoyingpan Outside the West Gate</h3>
<p>In the Nanshi area, large gangs of kidnappers have been frequently luring and abducting children, separating families. Since the beginning of spring, the eight-year-old daughter Fenghe of Wang at No. 81 Dongjiabo Laiyi Wharf, and the seven-year-old boy Zhao of Zhao Bingwu at No. 8 Yongzhenli have been kidnapped. A five-year-old boy Ashui of Han Yongliang at No. 2 Tongjili, Xiaopinong, was also kidnapped. The families of the victims searched everywhere. The other day, someone reported that there was a kidnapping ring near Kangwei Road in Laoyingpan outside the West Gate, all of whom were from Anhui. Sometimes they even acted as bandits. Therefore, they went to investigate and found Wang Fenghe living in the house of Fei Zhichun and Fei Ren. They had also changed the child's clothes to disguise her. However, as soon as Fenghe saw her family, she ran forward and hugged them, shouting for help. The kidnappers formed a gang. Seeing this situation, they beat up the families of the victims with Liao Xianwu and Wang, and tried to kidnap them. After the police arrived, the three suspects Fei Zhichun, Fei Ren, and Liao Xianwu were arrested. Wang and others escaped. They were escorted to the 2nd District Police Station. The suspects confessed that they were kidnappers selling people and claimed that they were brought by Zhou Abin, a duck slaughterer from Wenzhou, and handed over to their organization. They were immediately presented to the Public Security Bureau for instruction and sent to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Quarrel Over Baking Rice Cakes Leads to Murder</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Arrives in Wusong for Autopsy</p>
<p>Zhang and Qiu, Two Suspects Transferred to Court</p>
<p>Zhu Haishan, a resident behind the Huafeng Textile Mill in Wusong and a native of Chongming, had an only son named Xiaowulang, 18 years old. On the 10th of last month, Xiaowulang got into an argument with Zhang Erlang (18 years old), a fellow villager, over baking rice cakes in front of Qiu Jinhuo's house. At that time, Erlang's father, Zhang Wangfa, happened to be returning home and joined his son in hitting Wulang in the waist with an iron rake. Wulang was injured in the waist and was bedridden afterwards. He eventually died on March 1 due to ineffective treatment. Zhu Haishan, the father of the deceased, filed a complaint with the First Station of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the murderer be apprehended and investigated. His complaint stated briefly that this misfortune occurred because fellow villager Chen Qiu invited Wulang to help with the construction of a residence, and was hit in the waist (i.e., the blood sea) by Zhang Wangfa, Qiu Jinhuo's nephew, with an iron rake, causing him to vomit blood and stool and die. He also named Wu Yilang as a witness and reported to the Shanghai Local Court, requesting that an officer be dispatched to conduct an autopsy. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wu Deying, accompanied by secretary Wang Zhang and an autopsy examiner, arrived in Wusong at 6:00 PM to conduct the autopsy. It was found that Zhu Wulang died from injuries. He instructed the father to arrange for burial and bring the witness to court to await questioning. After receiving Zhu Haishan's complaint, the head of the First Station of the Seventh District of Wusong instructed the police to arrest the murderer Zhang Wangfa and the person of interest Qiu Jinhuo. Yesterday, a document was prepared and the police dispatched to transfer the two suspects Zhang and Qiu to court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Disputes After Housheng Closes Down May Be Coming to an End</h3>
<p>Bei and Xue Declared Not Guilty</p>
<p>After the Housheng Cotton Mill closed down, the mill's workers demanded distribution of bonuses, leading to litigation against the factory owners, Bei Runsheng and Xue Gansheng. One after another, most of the disputes were settled through reconciliation. Of the approximately 5,000 mill workers, over 3,000 received money through litigation. The remaining 2,000, unwilling to be left out, elected Xu Guiquan, Wang Gen, Chen Quan, Jin Jiajun, and others as representatives last autumn and hired lawyers to accuse Bei Runsheng and Xue Gansheng of embezzling bonuses, hoping that Bei and Xue would also reconcile with them. Unexpectedly, Bei and others, tired of the workers' constant entanglement, decided to pursue legal action. Xu hired a lawyer to defend, and also filed a counterclaim against the plaintiffs for false accusations. After repeated inquiries by the First Special District Local Court, Bei and Xue were found not guilty. Yesterday afternoon, Qian Wenji, the judge, summoned the four defendants, but only Xu Guiquan and Wang Genxin were present. According to the lawyer representing the two plaintiffs, Bei and Xue, the case of embezzlement filed by the defendants was entirely fabricated. After the verdict, the defendants did not repent and declared that they would appeal, intending to subject the plaintiffs to criminal punishment. However, they now confessed in court that the purpose of the litigation was to demand money from the plaintiffs, which shows that their claims are contradictory. If the defendants can withdraw the appeal, the plaintiffs will not pursue the matter; otherwise, they request that the two defendants present be charged with false accusations, and that summons be issued to arrest the remaining two defendants, Chen Hongquan and Jin Jiajun, for interrogation. The judge ordered a postponement to next Thursday for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>After the Escape of the Notorious Thief Zhai Da</h3>
<p>Detective Placed in Custody for Investigation</p>
<p>Last July, a case occurred on Xinqiao Road and Liyuan Road outside the West Gate in which a notorious thief shot and injured patrol officer Sun Jiming and killed plainclothes officer Zhang Hanchen. Recently, based on a report, the main culprit Zhai Da and others were arrested and escorted to Beijing. While Detective Yuan Mingcai and others were holding him at the Capital Hotel, he took the opportunity to escape, as reported earlier. When the detectives reported this, Director Wen was furious at their negligence in their duties. Yesterday, he specially ordered Detective Captain Lu Ying to place the detectives in custody for investigation and also issued an order to all districts and teams under his command to comply and intensify the pursuit and arrest of the escaped fugitive Zhai Da for investigation.</p>
<h3>Husband Suffers from Mental Illness, Wife Cannot Bear the Suffering and Requests a Divorce</h3>
<p>Wang Wenfang, daughter of Wang of Wang Shunxing Hardware Store, No. 303 Jiujiang Road and Guangxi Road, was married to Hu Liqing, son of Hu, owner of Lu Gaojian Changji Meat Store, No. 117 Xiamen Road, through the matchmaking of Xie Liangqing and Wang Agui when she was just 18 years old. After getting married, Wenfang realized that Liqing had a long-standing mental illness, and whenever he was ill, he would beat and abuse anyone he met, regardless of whether they were relatives or strangers. Wenfang was abused by him countless times, so they only lived together for a year before she returned to her mother's house, and it has been three years since then. Wenfang hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, requesting a divorce from Hu Liqing and requesting that he repay the debts of 1,200 yuan she had incurred over the past three years for living expenses. Yesterday morning, Judge Sanhu summoned both parties for trial. The plaintiff stated her reasons for the lawsuit. The defendant Hu Liqing stated that although he had suffered from mental illness in the past, he is now cured and does not want a divorce, and also hired a lawyer to file a counterclaim, requesting that Wang Wenfang be ordered to live with him again. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant's claim that he was cured was empty talk, and requested that the court appoint a doctor for examination. Judge Li stated that the plaintiff's litigation fees had not yet been paid, and if a doctor was appointed, there would be various expenses. He ordered the plaintiff to raise the funds and await instructions and advised the defendant that if he wanted the plaintiff to live with him, he should ask relatives and friends to mediate. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

They immediately stepped forward to stop it and conducted a search. They found the above-mentioned amount of red pills and arrested the driver, Chen Guisheng, along with the car, and took them to the police station for detention.

The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, explained the case and stated that the police were conducting a thorough investigation and requested a postponement. When questioned, Chen also confessed that he had transported the pills many times before. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, verified the confession and ordered him to be detained and interrogated again at a later date. After Detective Song and others arrested Chen, they conducted a thorough investigation and learned that there were three locations manufacturing the red pills: one in a nine-room foreign house at No. 19 Nianwu Village, Foch Road, Rue Moliere, in the Public Concession; two in a five-room foreign house at No. 7 Yongxiang Lane, Rue Edouard VII, in the French Concession; and three in a nine-room foreign house at No. 12 Foch Road, in the French Concession.

<h3>Perpetrator of the Shanghai Incident Receives a Light Sentence from the Japanese</h3>
<p>Guangcun, who set fire to the Sanyou Industrial Factory</p>

<p>Readers' Advisor</p>
<h3>Re-Discussing Suicide: A Message from Mr. Mochizuki</h3>
<p>Mr. [Editor],</p>
<p>Your reply really cannot fully satisfy me. Now, regarding the three points of your reply, I will analyze them separately and discuss them again. However, even if the arguments for defending or advocating suicide are more reasonable, they cannot gain any sympathy from you, and you are extremely opposed. This is something I knew deeply before asking because you are an aspiring scholar and a progressive revolutionary, and naturally, you would not sympathize with the weak.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding those who commit suicide due to being extremely weakened by poor health, you said, "Even if they are blind, deaf, or lame, they all have their work efficiency and opportunities to contribute to society." This statement may not be entirely correct. You should know that in this deformed society, even people with healthy bodies and minds find it difficult to find any work. Can all these so-called "disabled" people find work? They are unwilling to do nothing and beg for food, living a life of consumption. I admit that their suicide is insignificant to society!</p>
<p>(2) Regarding those who live a life of slavery and truly cannot break free and commit suicide, I will tell you a fact: "In our small city, there is a family of four: parents and two sons. The eldest son married a woman last year. Since marrying her husband, this woman has been beaten and scolded every day. It is truly 'beaten three times a day, knocked nine times every three days.' The husband and mother-in-law both beat her. This woman couldn't bear it. First, she begged, but they didn't listen. Later, she resisted in various ways, such as running away and fighting her husband, but none of them worked. If she ran away, they would chase her back and beat her even more severely. If she fought her husband, her mother-in-law and husband would tie her up and beat her severely. This woman had no close relatives on her mother's side, only a father, who was pitiful and didn't even care about his daughter's surname. This husband's family was a hereditary evil household. She had no way out and had to commit suicide to avoid suffering." Sir, how can this incompetent woman resist or break free? Finally, please do not truly believe in the theory of heaven and hell. Even in the underworld, she would still be a timid ghost!</p>
<p>(3) "Feeling bitterness everywhere, that the human world is empty, and there are no sympathetic poor people..." In your reply, you said bluntly, "What do you think would make you not bitter? A carriage with four horses? Abundant food and clothing? Beautiful wives and concubines? What do you think would make you not empty? Becoming the chairman? Getting rich like Hardoon?" Alas! Sir, this is wrong again. People who feel bitterness everywhere and are nervous do not become not bitter by being happy and fortunate. People who feel that the human world is empty certainly do not become not empty by becoming officials and getting rich. To be honest, even if they were given all the wealth in the world and made the king of the world, they would still be bitter and empty! As for you, sir, saying, "What kind of amazing person do you think you are? Why should anyone sympathize with you? Do you have great literary creations? Do you have any inventions?" This is even more incomprehensible to me. Are all your sympathetic people great creators? Are they all inventors? Do you need to have great creations and inventions to be sympathized with? Poor people have the sympathy of poor people, rich people have the sympathy of rich people, revolutionaries have the sympathy of revolutionaries, and each has their own sympathy. According to what you said earlier, doesn't that mean there is no sympathy in China? I ask you, how many inventors and great creators are there in the country? The people in this world who are worth cherishing are those with a little sympathy. Otherwise, the world would not progress and might even perish! What do you think, sir? I hope you can teach me!</p>
<p>Reply:</p>
<p>It is very welcome to discuss the issue of suicide again in your letter. However, the arguments in the first two points are still nothing more than that the suicide is inevitable, and we should admit that their suicide is correct, and your view of suicide is thus established. In fact, the fundamental difference between you and me lies in this. You only start from the inevitability of the suicide or being forced by the environment and unable to struggle. To be honest, we should of course shed a tear of sympathy for this kind of suicide. However, can you and I overthrow the dark forces that force people to commit suicide, or can we awaken the evil forces to pity us by committing suicide? Even a three-year-old child knows that it is impossible. Then, isn't this kind of suicide directly encouraging people to commit suicide (in fact, suicide is surrendering to evil forces)? Indirectly, isn't it reducing ideological resistance and action resistance for evil forces? Moreover, the root of your suicide view is completely the remnant poison of individualism. If our every move and every word is not built on the interests of the majority of mankind in the world, or at least the largest number of human beings in the past, future, and present, then you will naturally not find a place to live. Once you encounter environmental difficulties, you will become passive. When passive thoughts develop to a certain degree, you will commit suicide. If your view of suicide is interpreted in this way, there will be no history of human struggle, and the French Revolution, the American War of Independence, and the Russian Revolution would not have happened. Until now, we are still in the feudal aristocratic society and the state of slavery. At that time, I am afraid you and I would not even have the opportunity to study the issue of suicide in the newspaper in such a leisurely manner. Our many ancestors have struggled several times to win us some social happiness today. If we commit suicide when we encounter difficulties, our ancestors would shout from underground, "Unfilial descendants, you are worthless!" The incompetent woman you mentioned who was forced to commit suicide by the family environment is indeed a fact, but is your so-called view of suicide based on this kind of suicide? And are you willing to be as ignorant and unknowledgeable as this kind of woman and abandon your responsibility to society? Indeed, I want to say something presumptuously: "What's the point of discussing her?" Our dictionary has never had the term "heaven and hell." What I said in my previous reply was just a hypothetical statement, not a true belief in such a realm. The context before and after is clear at a glance. You think we are believers in ghosts? It can be said that "the previous words were just a joke!" As for the third point, we also have our reasons. There is indeed a kind of celebrity faction in China, or it can be said to be a decadent faction. When writing poetry, they always sigh and weep. When writing articles, they always complain about heaven and blame others. The implication is that I have the talent to help the world and save the people, but the world does not use me, so I am discouraged, as if there is no place for me in the world. These people always feel that society owes them, that society does not recognize them, and does not give them the appropriate treatment and sympathy. In all fairness, some people in society should be responsible for him, but most of the oppressed society is looking forward to ambitious people who are willing to fight for them to stand up and resist the evil forces. However, because they are overwhelmed by the oppression of the evil forces, they have the idea of suicide. Then, why should society express sympathy for you? Moreover, you said, "Because I am poor and have a little ambition, I don't know how to socialize or flatter..." Using this as a reason for your suicide, isn't this clearly blaming society, or the government, or some organization for not having eyes to recognize you, this "talented person" with "a little ambition"? I want to tell a joke again: "It's a pity that there is no King Wen of Zhou in this world. Otherwise, if you fished by the Wei River, you could definitely become the teacher of the king..." It's also a pity that there is no Liu Bei in this world, and no Xu Yuanzhi's recommendation. Otherwise, someone would definitely be humble and generous and "visit the thatched cottage three times." Sir! This is a frivolous delusion! An outdated idea! A person who does not fight for society with his own body and does not decide in advance will be rejected everywhere. Let's take Mr. Sun Yat-sen as an example. Now everyone knows "President Sun, President Sun," and now everyone regards him as a god. However, they only see Mr. Sun, who succeeded and died, but they did not see Mr. Sun when he was exiled to Japan, imprisoned in England, and surrounded by Guanyin Mountain. At that time, Mr. Sun never had a trace of decadence. The more a person can shoulder the burden, the less he blames others for what sympathy is not. The so-called "The Tao is one foot high, and the devil is ten feet high." Although we do not believe in religion, a hero who fights for the masses is always carrying a cross forward. If you haven't done anything and immediately blame others for not sympathizing with you, to be honest, that is really limited. I want to ask, what is the "ambition" you mentioned? What is the "aspiration"? I would like to hear your clear teaching. After reading our above explanation, you can understand that what we said last time, "What do you think would make you not bitter? ...Getting rich like Hardoon?" was not aimless. And "What kind of amazing person do you think you are...do you have any inventions?" was also not baseless. I also tell you that the people in this world are sympathetic, but I hope you will look at things from a different perspective!</p>

<h3>The Jiangsu Education Department Rectifies Primary Schools in Various Counties</h3>
<p>First, Issue Key Points for Urgent Improvement</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department issued an instruction to the education bureaus of various counties, saying, "The Education Bureau Directors' Conference last year formulated seven measures for rectifying the existing primary schools in various counties, and this department ordered them to be strictly followed. In addition, the provincial supervisors' inspection points previously issued also detailed how primary schools in various counties should be run in item (C). It is hereby ordered to be followed. This director inspected the primary schools in Tongru and other counties, and reviewed the inspection reports of the provincial supervisors. Very few primary schools in various counties can follow the successive orders and key points for rectification. The situation is especially serious in rural primary schools. If improvements are not ordered, the impact on educational efficiency will be significant. Therefore, a list of key points for urgent improvement in primary schools in various counties is specially formulated as the minimum standard for the content of rectification in primary schools in various counties. The key points are now checked and issued, and the directors of the bureaus are ordered to urge the principals of various primary schools to seriously implement them and not to neglect them in the slightest. Special attention should be paid to the primary schools in various rural areas, and no concealment should be allowed, so that there will be no progress. The detailed plan for improving the content of primary schools is being formulated by this department and will be promulgated soon for the entire reform. This department will from now on assess the implementation status at any time as the standard for whether or not to actively rectify. The directors of the bureaus should also frequently instruct the supervisors to strictly supervise and earnestly implement the primary schools. Do not pretend to comply, lest there be inconvenience. I hope you will all adhere to it." The order includes a copy of the key points for improvement.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Urgent Improvement in Primary Schools in Various Counties</h3>
<p>I. Administration</p>
<p>1.  Each grade must enroll at least 50 students.

The Ministry will send personnel to inspect again to observe the effect.</p>
<h3>The City Education Bureau's Third Radio Broadcast Yesterday</h3>
<p>Broadcast by Director Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Education and the Country and Nation</p>
<p>Since the City Education Bureau started its wireless broadcasting this month, Director Pan Gongzhan gave a speech on the 1st, and Section Chief Chen Bai gave a speech on the 2nd. Both were held at the Zhongxi Pharmacy Radio Station. Yesterday (the 4th) at 4:00 p.m., the bureau broadcast an education program at the Da Zhonghua Company Radio Station. The title was "Education and the Country and Nation," and it was widely praised. It is reported that the bureau attaches great importance to this radio broadcast. In addition to designating a special commissioner from the Fourth Section to be responsible for hosting it, it is also very willing for people from all walks of life to offer opinions after listening to it for reference. It can be communicated directly with the section.</p>
<h3>Mr. Pan Gongzhan's Speech</h3>
<p>(I) Today, I will talk with you about education and the nation and the people, because the rise and fall of the nation and the survival of the people are closely related to the quality of education. Good education can cultivate good citizens, and with good citizens, a strong country can be formed, and the resulting people will surely flourish. Conversely, if education fails and the people become degenerate, then society will inevitably become disorganized, the country will inevitably weaken, and the survival of the people will naturally become a problem. To understand the principles behind this, we must know what education is, what a nation is, and then see what relationship education has with the nation and the people. What is education? It is impossible to answer this question satisfactorily in a few words. In a broad sense, education is the undertaking of mature people to develop the minds and bodies of immature people to prepare them for future social life and to transmit the culture of previous generations. Here, we can already see that educational activities involve two aspects: those who provide education and those who receive it. The mission of education is to ensure that the minds and bodies of those being educated can develop healthily to adapt to social life and perpetuate the culture of the people.</p>
<p>(II) So, what is a nation? Different schools of thought have different ideas about the nation (this is a central issue in political science, which we don't need to go into in detail here and cannot go into in detail). Some view the nation as the totality of all special groups, and the people, as the constituent members of the nation, have only the duty to obey the nation, regarding the nation as an idol. Some take "freedom" as the basis and view the nation as an organ that protects human freedom, preventing mutual infringement between individuals internally and preventing foreign aggression externally. The nation itself has no purpose, but is only a method of protecting individual freedom. Some view the nation as a tool for the ruling class to control the ruled class. Still others consider that the nation is one or several forces that can coexist equally with other societies, not above all societies, but merely a society parallel to other societies. Among the above statements, regarding the nation as a societal body with the nation itself as the goal is certainly incorrect. To see the nation as an oppressive organization is also putting the cart before the horse and is very wrong. However, the nation is indeed a kind of tool, a territorial group with specific functions and defined boundaries, formed by people's consent to achieve specific common purposes. As for the so-called people, it refers to a number of people who are related by blood, language, religion, life, customs, and habits. Some countries in the world are composed of several people, and some people are divided into several countries. The relationship between education, the nation, and the people has already been discussed, and now we will examine the relationship between education and the nation and the people.</p>
<p>(III) Since the nation is a group to achieve specific public goals, and among these public goals, there is nothing greater than the guarantee and promotion of peace, security, and happiness, and since the nation has certain functions, guaranteeing and promoting the peace, security, and happiness of the people is naturally within its functions. From what has been said earlier, we know that the function of education lies in developing the mind and body and transmitting the culture of previous generations. Therefore, if the nation wants to fulfill its mission and implement its functions, it cannot but rely on education. Therefore, education is the lifeline of the nation and the people. If a nation wants to be rich and strong, if a people want to prosper, and if the people want to be happy, then the nation's education must be effective. Our China can now be said to be in a terrible state. Where does this result come from? It is because the education of the past few decades has not been effective. Because education has not been effective, the people do not have good knowledge and abilities, lack good character, and cannot establish true faith. The current situation is like this, and the relationship between education and the nation and the people is so close. If we want to achieve the goal of saving the country through education, we must carefully examine the shortcomings of the times and thoroughly reform. Educators themselves should first have awareness, cultivate themselves and set an example, adhere to the principles of the Three People's Principles of education, and dedicate themselves to the cause of education, striving for the cause of education. People in society should also be aware of the importance of education and do their best to help the government complete this great mission. Only then will there be hope for the future of our nation and our people.</p>

<p>The Youyou football team was originally scheduled to play the British Navy yesterday in the Western League First Division match at the China Baseball Field, but because the Navy team's star players had to attend the England-Scotland International Football Final yesterday, the match with Youyou was changed to a friendly. The two sides played in the rain, and the Youyou team had a solid lineup and strong unity. The Navy was far from their match, and as a result, Youyou won by a large margin of 11-1, with the score being 4-0 at halftime.</p>
<h3>All Matches of the China Football Association Are Suspended Today</h3>

<h3>The First Act of the International Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>Chinese Women Defeat the United States</p>
<p>Result: 44-29</p>
<p>British Women Defeat the Federation 38-30</p>
<p>Men's Preliminary Round: Philippines Forfeits</p>
<p>This year's Shanghai International Basketball Tournament opened last night at the China Basketball Hall on Route Father Laro. The opening act was the women's group match between Britain and the Federation. The competition between the two teams was very watchable. In the end, the British team won 38-30. In the second match, the Chinese women's team played against the United States. The Chinese team had an unexpectedly wonderful performance, so the American team, despite its excellent skills, had to admit defeat. The Philippines team was unable to participate last night due to delays in procedures and conceded the match, which was a great pity. There were about seven or eight hundred spectators, which was a rare sight on this rainy spring night. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Britain Defeats the Federation 38-30</h3>
<p>The opening act was the women's group match between Britain and the Federation. Both teams were strong. The British team was mainly composed of the rowing Green team. Their passing and shooting were very watchable. The Federation was composed of Portuguese, Jewish, and Russian female players such as Marty and Jie Hansheng, who were all top picks for a time. However, the talent was not as evenly distributed as in the British team. In the end, the Federation lost 30-38. The performances were all excellent.</p>
<p>First Half: The game started with contact, and the situation was quite even. The British team took a 10-7 lead in the first quarter. The Federation fought bravely, and Jie Hansheng and Marty made contributions from time to time. Although the British team was strong, they did not feel any less. It had been tied twice at 14-14 and 16-16. However, from then on, the British team became more prosperous again, and Princess B became very motivated, winning the first half with 20-16.</p>
<p>Second Half: From then on, the British team took the lead all the way. Although the Federation continued to work hard and tried to retaliate, they were unable to do so because the opponent's defenses were tight. The situation was quite interesting, with clear movements and rapid passing. In the end, Britain won 38-30.</p>

<h3>China Beats the United States 44-29</h3>
<p>China's victory over the United States was entirely in the first and fourth quarters. As for the second and third quarters, the American team exerted great pressure and once tied the game at 25. The competition between the two teams was very watchable. Judging from the fighting spirit of the Chinese female players last night, there may be hope of defeating Britain and winning the championship. The forwards shot accurately, and their passing was also commendable. It is a pity that Yang Sen sometimes has selfish and self-serving shortcomings. Among the guards, Wang Zhixin is the best, and Huang Shuhua is also very stable. In short, the work of the whole team has reached a wonderful level.</p>
<h3>One Drum of Energy</h3>
<p>Referee Shu Hong ordered the mobilization, and the two sides began to contact. Yang Sen and Bai Naite lost opportunities to each other. The United States surrounded the basket and fired from left and right, and finally Bai Naite scored first. Before long, Yang Sen returned the favor, and Chen Jucai added two more. From then on, the Chinese team's aura was immense, and they were able to do everything smoothly and without hindrance. The American team could not defend against it and was at a loss. At the end of the first quarter, China had a total of sixteen points, and the United States had only two points.</p>
<h3>Gradually Tense</h3>
<p>Starting in the second quarter, the United States made great efforts, and the situation gradually became tense. The beautiful players first scored five points, and China returned two. After that, the American team was quite dominant. The defensive work in the rear was also meticulous. Forward Bai Naite was the most valiant. Ms. Xu of Massachusetts and Ms. Pi were quite cooperative. The score difference in this quarter was half, with the American team winning 12-6, but the total score for the first half was still in favor of China, with 22-14.</p>
<h3>The United States Catches Up</h3>
<p>When the battle started again, the American players showed great power, and the scores increased steadily. After a short period of maneuvering, China was only three points ahead, and the score became 23-20, and the situation felt dangerous. Afterwards, the score became 25-23. At this time, the audience shouted loudly, anxious. The blue-eyed and yellow-haired people felt even more pleased and delighted. By the end of the third quarter, the total score was 25-24, with the United States only one point behind.</p>
<h3>The Final Majesty</h3>
<p>The reason why China lost so much in the three quarters and was able to be caught up by the United States was actually because of the exit of guard Wang Zhixin, so from the fourth quarter, Wang was urgently called back in, but in the confusion, the recorder was not notified, so he was penalized a ball, causing the United States to tie the score at 25. At this time, the Chinese team suddenly saw the light of day again after the storm, and unconsciously became greatly energized and suddenly prosperous, charging into the battle like a broken bamboo. Yang Sen scored one goal after another, winning many goals in a row, like ascending to the clouds. On the other hand, the American team was discouraged and their offense and defense were clumsy. In this quarter, China scored a total of 19 points. As a result, China won the final victory, and the score was 44-29.</p>

<h3>The Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education Formulates Shuttlecock Competition Rules</h3>
<p>To be held in the capital on the 26th</p>
<p>Circular order for provinces, cities, and bureaus to handle</p>
<p>The Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education believes that shuttlecock kicking is a good sport inherent in our country, simple and easy to do, and beneficial to mass sports. It should be actively promoted. It has formulated shuttlecock competition rules and registration forms, and yesterday specially sent a circular to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities ordering them to hold competitions on a regular basis. In the capital, it is reported that the competition is scheduled to be held on the 26th of this month, and it is also scheduled to meet with representatives of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in the conference room of the Ministry of Education at 3:00 pm on the 8th of this month to discuss preparations for all matters. The rules are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Shuttlecock Competition Rules</p>
<p>(1) Participants, regardless of gender, age, or youth, must specify in the registration form how many styles they can usually kick and how many times each style can be kicked.</p>
<p>(2) The competition is divided into two types: (A) ordinary competition and (B) special competition.</p>
<p>(3) The ordinary competition focuses on disc kicking. Disc kicking means using the inner ankle of the left and right feet to kick the shuttlecock once each as one disc kick. The person who can kick the most disc kicks wins.</p>
<p>(4) The ordinary competition is divided into five levels. Those who can usually kick more than 700 disc kicks are in the first level, 500 to 700 in the second level, 300 to 500 in the third level, 200 to 300 in the fourth level, and less than 100 in the fifth level.</p>
<p>(5) The special competition focuses on alternating kicking. Alternating kicking means jumping up with both feet crossed, one foot on top and one foot below. The foot below kicks the shuttlecock with the inner ankle next to the body. The one on the left side of the body is called left alternating kicking, then the left foot is on top and the right foot is below. The right foot below kicks the shuttlecock with the right inner ankle. The one on the right side of the body is called right alternating kicking, then the right foot is on top and the left foot is below. The left foot below kicks the shuttlecock with the left inner ankle. Regardless of left or right, the person who can kick the most consecutive alternating kicks wins.</p>
<p>(6) The special competition is divided into three levels. Those who can usually kick more than 100 alternating kicks are in the first level, 50 to 100 in the second level, and less than 50 in the third level.</p>
<p>(7) People of the same level compete against each other. Each level is a group, and the person who kicks more times in each group wins. In a certain group competition, if the number of kicks exceeds the group they have reached, they can be included in the next level for awards, but those whose number of kicks does not reach the level will not be awarded.</p>
<p>(8) The competition is only divided into disc kicking and alternating kicking. Other styles will be performed after the competition. Those who perform more styles will get an excellent award, and those who perform more styles and have good posture will get the best award. There is no fixed number of excellent awards and the best awards.</p>
<p>International Football Cup</p>
<h3>1932-33 Scotland Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>Defeated England yesterday by a score of four to three</p>
<p>The whole team has excellent cooperation and superior skills</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football League's International Cup final was held at Yiyuan at 3:00 pm yesterday. In the drizzling rain, Scotland defeated England 4-3 to win the 1932-33 championship. The awards were presented by Zhao Jinqing, director of the Sports Association.</p>
<h3>Scotland Lives Up to Its Name</h3>
<p>Scotland, with Arga as the main body, plus good players from the Western Police, presented a strong military appearance in the match against China. After China's defeat, only England remained. England was indeed strong, but it finally lost to Scotland 3-4. There are two reasons for this: First, the team's alignment and distribution have been in place for a long time, and cooperation is natural. Second, the players have superior skills, and there are talented people inside and outside. However, if England had been more fortunate in the first half, it would have achieved more, and the outcome would have been different.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Team Is Unbearable to Recall</h3>
<p>The Chinese team had held the title for two consecutive years in the past two years. By this year, all the heroes gathered, and the call for the championship was very high. When they fought to the semi-finals, they met Scotland. At that time, in addition to the original elite lineup, several new players from South China came, and they were very ambitious. Unfortunately, due to the loss of control and the scattered formation, they suffered the disaster of being eliminated. Looking back on the past, they were filled with regret.</p>
<h3>Past Winners of the International Cup</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai has had the International Cup, there have been sixteen times so far. It was stopped during the European War and last year's Shanghai War. England has won the most championships in the past, eight times, followed by Scotland four times, China twice, and Ireland and Portugal once each. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>1912-13 Ireland</p>
<p>1913-15 England</p>
<p>1919-23 England</p>
<p>1924-26 Scotland</p>
<p>1928-29 Portugal</p>
<p>1929-30 Chinese team</p>
<p>1932-33 Scotland</p>
<h3>This Year's Battle for the Crown</h3>
<h3>A Record of the Great Battle Between the Scottish and English Armies</h3>
<p>Half joy and half surprise</p>
<p>Fighting for ninety minutes in the drizzling rain was a difficult task. In addition, the field was muddy, making it difficult to maneuver. The amount of water absorbed by the ball made it heavier, which inevitably reduced the performance of each player. The mood of both sides was extremely tense. Scotland fought against the wind, and Hughes broke in on the left, and Axu returned to save the match. The ball hit him in the chest, and he was penalized a twelve-yard penalty. Turner won without any effort, and the ball went straight into the net. The Scottish team won a goal. Within five minutes, each side had gained a goal, half joy and half surprise.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly</p>
<p>The English army was in a dominant position, and Defei went straight in. Han Tele broke through in the center again, and the English army took the lead 2-1. At that time, the Scottish army was weak internally, and the external fronts were unfavorable. Only the English army was very active. Fortunately, good luck had not yet arrived, and they often suffered from failing to get goals. The Scottish army occasionally counterattacked, passing left and right, and McTavish returned, tying the game at 2-2. Near the end of the game, Scottish Hughes again went in alone, shooting from twenty yards. The goalkeeper dived and blocked it with his arm, but it leaked in from his fingers. In the first half, the Scottish army took the lead 3-2.</p>
<p>The superior team finally wins</p>
<p>In the second half, the Scottish army greatly improved. The whole team was energetic and stayed in English territory for a long time, attacking endlessly. Unexpectedly, in less than ten minutes, the English army's Defei, with the help of the right wing, peeped into the enemy's goal and went down in one fell swoop, creating a score of 3-3. The score was the same, but the situation was different. The Scottish team cooperated skillfully and controlled the overall situation. McTavish scored another goal, making it 4-3. The Scottish army then returned triumphantly.</p>
<p>Awarding Ceremony</p>
<p>After the game, the athletes of the two teams gathered together, and the president, Graham Tang, gave encouragement. Zhao Jinqing, director of the China National Sports Association, gave a speech, congratulating the success of the Scottish team, and presented the awards. Han Shen Silang, honorary chairman of the Sports Association, also participated in the grand event. The referee for this important game was Mr. He Chunhui from China, who was fair and just and deserved to be commended.</p>

<h3>Last Night's Western Youth Volleyball Match: China Youth Wins Five Straight Games</h3>
<p>Narrowly Wins Over MacLaine in Three Sets</p>
<p>45-41, a difference of four points</p>
<p>Jiang Wan Jia Defeats Black and White by a Large Margin</p>
<p>In the Western Youth Volleyball Tournament, China Youth defeated MacLaine 3-0 again, setting a record of five wins in five games. Although China Youth won 3-0, it was very close and tense. The scores were 15-14, 15-14, and 15-13. Jiang Wan Jia defeated Black and White. In the Group B matches, MacLaine B defeated Jiang Wan B 37-29. Yinghua defeated Huang Ke 45-15. Western Youth B defeated Nie Zhongcheng 45-10. Church defeated All White 45-28. Russian Overseas Chinese defeated Jewish 45-6.</p>
<h3>China Youth Wins Dangerously</h3>
<p>Carelessness Almost Leads to Disaster. MacLaine's skills are far behind China Youth, but the three games were all the same, and it was unspeakably dangerous. To put it bluntly, China Youth was too careless and almost fell victim to the enemy. At the beginning of each game, China Youth took the lead. In the first game, China Youth was ahead 10-6, but MacLaine caught up to 12-12 and then overtook them 14-13. Fortunately, China Youth's last three attacks brought them back to 15-14. The second game was the same. China Youth again took the lead 8-3 and 14-7. Who knew that MacLaine would gradually catch up, scoring seven points in a row, making it 14-14. In this dangerous situation, China Youth won again 15-14. The situation suddenly changed in the third game. MacLaine advanced again and again. China Youth had one point, and MacLaine had already scored seven points. Fortunately, Xu Heng served the ball at 3-8, and he took back as many as eight points in one go, making it 8-8 first, and then chasing out 11-8. Then tension was seen again, 12-12, 13-13. China Youth added two points to win the third game.</p>
<p>Far East General Shows His Power. The best performance of the China Youth team was Xu Heng, the representative of the Far East. This was his second appearance in the Western Youth, and he was more familiar with the situation and made great strides compared to last week. His attacks rarely failed to score. Together with Chen Qiu, they attacked and defended each other, and attacked the enemy with force. The two players' contributions were equal. The names of the two teams are as follows: China Youth Team, Chen Qiu, Wei Dingyi, Xu Heng, Guo Xiebiao (Tan Tianpei replaced him from the second game), Li Feiming, Cai Tiange. MacLaine Team, Kerr Men, Qin Bo, Te Wensi, Bo Wen, Nelson, He De</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Shanghai Small Talk</h3>
<p>— Mr. Ladder</p>
<p>If anyone doesn't believe the saying that "people are not as good as dogs," please go to the so-called "Land King's" foreign mansion and take a look around the dog palace outside. I guarantee that they will be happy and amazed at first, and then feel a sense of loss.</p>
<p>This is what people in the foreign mansion say... "The King has a large number of dogs. The seats are always full of dogs, and the plates are never empty of meat. Large and small, he raises over a hundred famous Chinese and Western dogs. Not to mention anything else, the dog biscuits alone, ordered from abroad every year, cost several thousand silver dollars."  The King's dogs, of course, have skills that "people don't have." It is said that "every morning when the factory releases steam to start work, with a 'whoosh' sound, many dogs also release steam at the same time. However, the King's foreign mansion is not in an industrial area, so the surrounding foreign adults jointly sent a sad and beautiful letter, prohibiting the release of steam. The King's reply was that all the foreign adults must move within three months, as all of this was the King's property. The poor foreign adults, who loved peace and quiet the most, had no choice but to lower their flags and drums, and respectfully endure the steam release."</p>
<p>I think that since foreign adults have been "protesting," this response should be the most satisfying. However, this kind of arrogance from the big landlord is ultimately unacceptable. Therefore, although our government doesn't collect rent, it still politely accommodates the foreign adults' face.</p>
<h3>A Story Recorded in the Spring and Autumn Annals</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Yesterday, while reading the newspaper, I saw the telegram from the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, urging "Chairman Chiang to go north to supervise the army." This suddenly made me, who hadn't contributed in a long time, feel itchy and compelled to write a few nonsense words.</p>
<p>I remember when I was thirteen or fourteen years old, after reading "The Book of Rites," I went on to read "The Book of Documents," which made me feel dizzy and confused. What were they talking about in the middle? Now that I think about it, it's still a mystery. In fact, if I hadn't read these books at that time, I would have missed the opportunity. Later, when the teacher explained and read "The Spring and Autumn Annals," I began to find some interest in the book.</p>
<p>One day, I remember it was probably during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, when the Battle of the Yalu River was lost and the Kowshing was sunk, I read: "Zhao Jianzi personally led troops to attack Wei. During the battle, he stood far away, hiding behind the shield, beating the drum, but the soldiers did not advance. Jianzi threw down the drumstick and sighed, 'Are the soldiers so exhausted?' The officer Zhuguo, removing his helmet, stepped forward and said, 'It's because the ruler is incompetent, how can the soldiers be exhausted? In the past, our former ruler, Duke Xian, annexed seventy states in the fifth year of his reign, using these soldiers. Duke Hui was tyrannical and slow, and the Qin people invaded, reaching seventeen li from Jiang, using these soldiers. Duke Wen built on this with courage, and in three years, the soldiers were all brave and decisive, defeating the Chu people five times, and achieving fame in the world, using these soldiers. It's because the ruler is incompetent, how can the soldiers be exhausted?' Jianzi then left the shield and stood within range of arrows and stones. With one drumbeat, the soldiers all charged forward." Reading this passage of history recorded in the Spring and Autumn Annals, I naturally felt elated and hated the generals of that time, who were incompetent. Even a coward would have mustered a hundred and twenty percent of courage to kill the enemy and achieve results. Therefore, when I read the telegram from the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, with the words "Without you, sir, personally going north to supervise the army, to command and control, it is not enough to strengthen the morale of the soldiers in the front and save the crisis," I felt a deep surge of emotion. Because the fall of the Northeast appears to be easily gained by the violent Japanese, but in reality, the people of Liaoning and Shenyang have been fighting the Japanese invaders in a bloodbath every day for a year, constantly resisting with their lives. If there had been a commander standing on the front line early on, wouldn't it have been like having Qi Jiguang as a general? Then, even a single soldier from Yiwu would become famous throughout the world and be called invincible? Alas! Because of this, I hope that, like Zhao Jianzi in the Spring and Autumn period, he will not hide behind the shield, but quickly and decisively mount his horse and go to kill the bandits. I also offer this advice to the responsible authorities who now hold military power.</p>
<h3>Thought is Omnipotent</h3>
<p>— Bai He</p>
<p>"Hands are omnipotent" is a phrase used to encourage people, meaning that if a person has hands and works diligently, they will never starve to death. To put it more profoundly, with a pair of hands, one can always put food between the thirty-six teeth and not starve to death. However, this saying has now been overthrown by me. Because I once saw a beggar without hands who could still beg for food and use his feet to feed himself to survive. This is not surprising. Recently, near us, there was a body found on the street. After the police took it to the morgue for examination, it was said that it died of starvation. However, this corpse not only had two perfectly formed hands, but also had ten fingers on each hand. From this, it can be seen that even if a person has hands, they can do at most nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine things. Omnipotence still lacks the ability to sustain life. Animals that walk on four legs have never had a hand in their lives, but they don't necessarily die at birth.</p>
<p>Since the golden words "Hands are omnipotent" cannot be established, then what exactly is omnipotent? I say that only thought is omnipotent. Inventing an ideology can make people do whatever you want. Inventing something in science makes even an omnipotent doctor respectfully decline and feel inferior. Whether you are upper, middle, or lower class, those who have thought always have the advantage. Ideologists and scientists go without saying. Even in business, you need to have ideas to come up with new tricks and be popular. Furthermore, it's clearly aggression, but they insist on calling it armed peace. If there were no thought, wouldn't they be unable to escape the bad name of aggression? The name "kidnapping" is so harsh, so people with ideas beautify it by calling it "inviting the god of wealth." Spending money to be the god of wealth, seeking fame rather than profit, what wealthy person wouldn't want to do it? There are plenty of people in the world who have perfectly good hands but starve to death. People with ideas will never starve to death. Therefore, I say that the throne of omnipotence should be given to Mr. Thought to sit on.</p>
<h3>In the Little Guanghan Palace</h3>
<p>— Pu Diexiu</p>
<p>The city, the beautiful city, red, yellow, white, purple... all kinds of colors, people intoxicated in this place, wander around day and night. Forgetting everything, abandoning everything. Although the situation in the motherland is so bad, the war in the Rehe area has already fiercely begun, but it's far away, so they indulge in pleasure. Anyway, during the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, although the sound of machine guns and cannons never stopped, didn't a certain group still enjoy themselves with great enthusiasm?</p>
<p>Therefore, although donations to the support association are ignored, on weekends, and actually even on weekdays, movie theaters and amusement parks can always close their iron gates and hang up the "full house" sign. The Little Guanghan Palace on the side of the Four Horse Road is the same every day, every month.</p>
<p>This is a place where famous flowers gather. Although they all rely on singing to earn money like Dr. Mei, more or less, the temptation of flesh, the enchantment of color, as well as charming eyes, curled hair, waist, and blood-red lips, are all the means of these "entertainment doesn't forget the national crisis" tourists. There, they laugh, relax, and enjoy themselves. Undoubtedly, there is no impression of the national crisis in their minds.</p>
<p>"Extravagance" is the custom of people in the city. Therefore, the cost of one yuan and two jiao to order a song is repeated one after another. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Li, and some Mr. S, Mr. ABC... The most ridiculous thing is that someone used "Merchant Girl" as their name. Truly, they are a clear-headed great citizen! They look very proud, smoking cigarettes, drinking fragrant tea, listening to Peking opera, and at the same time, loudly calling out for applause.</p>
<p>Suddenly, news vendors shouting headlines came to sell the newspapers that were published at that time. Although the headlines used the largest font, clearly showing that the situation was very tense, its temptation was ultimately inferior to the bodies on the stage. Although the price was only thirty or forty coins a piece, not to be cynical, not even four or five out of a hundred people bought it. So, I understand, fully understand, that this serious national crisis is no match for a few fleshly frames. A headline costing thirty or forty coins a piece cannot compete with the cost of one yuan and two jiao for a song. Although it is said that city people are extravagant by nature... I heard the above conversation from a friend. I, unable to cry or laugh, had no choice but to sigh.</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter One</p>
<p>Pushing Food Eagerly, Invited Poor Girl to Remember</p>
<p>Entering the Door Generously, with the Bearing of a Warrior</p>
<p>She was separated by a tattered blue cloth door curtain and said this to her mother. Mrs. Jiang replied from inside, "Yes, you would even say that the farts of the Gan family across the street are fragrant, not to mention what Second Master Gan says. "The old girl, separated by the door curtain, smiled, glanced towards the inner room, but pretended to be fierce, saying, "What are you saying? You don't even care if people can stand it or not. If what people say is right, what else can I say? If you're not afraid of coal fumes, you can move the stove into the room to add fire. I still want to live to see the world." "I'm going to visit the Wang family next door." Mrs. Jiang said, "Don't go. The Wangs are quarreling. Just add fire to the stove outside." As the mother and daughter were arguing in separate rooms, someone walked in from the outer courtyard, asking, "Old girl, is your mother home?" Mrs. Jiang replied, "Speak of Second Master Gan, and Second Master Gan appears. I'm home." Second Master Gan was wearing a gray thread-spun sheepskin robe, with a package under his arm. He walked to the outer room and saw the old girl standing in the middle of the room, facing the stove, just staring blankly. He smiled and said to her, "It's quite cold in the outer room. Why are you standing here?" The old girl smiled and said, "Didn't you say, Second Master, that adding coal in the room will fume people? We're adding coal in the outer room." Mrs. Jiang interjected from the room, "Second Master, you see, our old girl really listens to you. It's cold outside. Please come in and sit." Hearing this, Second Master Gan took the package and walked into the inner room. Mrs. Jiang took the package, weighed it twice, and smiled, "Second Master, what else do you want to do for us?" He replied, "You see, the surface of my fur robe is about to wear out. I need to quickly make a covering robe to cover it." Mrs. Jiang smiled and said, "It can be made, but no tailor can make it fit." Second Master Gan smiled and said, "What's the point of being so particular about a blue cloth gown? I want to make the clothes, and I'm willing to pay for it. Giving the tailor's wages to you is still helping you. Isn't that killing two birds with one stone?" The old girl smiled and said, "Second Master is always so kind-hearted. But actually, women's work is women's work, and tailoring is tailoring. It's not the same." Mrs. Jiang smiled, "Second Master, sit down. Let me make some water..." Second Master Gan quickly stopped her, saying, "I come here many times a day. If you're so polite every time, I'll be embarrassed to come again." (Two)</p>

In addition, the Central Bank suddenly opened 2,000 or so gold bars, and Hengxing and others in the market came in with great force, and the exchange market improved slightly, rising to 50 taels and 3 qian.

Ruixing also declined, even to within 4 taels, at 3.5 taels. HSBC bought June US dollars at 29 yuan. Hengxing came in, and Yuan Maoyong also bought, rising to 5 taels. After this, the HSBC listing was announced, British-American rates were unchanged, but in this stormy situation, they declined instead.

Yuanchun came in to buy gold bars, gradually increasing to 4 taels and 9 qian. However, the selling pressure was still fierce, and the exchange market continued to harden.

Hengxing then came in, rising to 2 taels. Zhifeng Yong declined madly, selling gold bars in succession. Hengyu Yifeng Yong Fuyu also sold. June US dollars at 3.125 were not easy to sell, breaking 50 taels again, at 48 taels or so. Bingxing came to cover short positions and struggled, hovering at 9 taels or so. Afterwards, the selling wind came horizontally, engulfing the entire market in an instant. People's hearts were originally fearful that the Guangdong gang would release a cage of goods as a danger. Zhifeng Yong Hengyu sold in unison, and turned downstream. Before long, Hengxing came up to sell gold bars. People's hearts were greatly damaged at once, and they followed the trend one after another. Qian Changxiang also sold, dropping to 43 taels in an instant. Although the exchange market eased 0.125 again, HSBC bought June US dollars at 4.375.</p>
<p>In addition, Reuters transmitted that the US silver purchase proposal would be postponed to March 20 for further discussion. The selling wind subsided slightly, and the buying wind rose. Fuchang and Dachen all took advantage of the low prices to buy gold bars, rising to 7 taels or so. Zhaofengchang also had purchases, for 7 taels or so. However, sellers were still surging, and before long it fell to 5.5 taels again. Zhaofengchang bought again, for 7 taels or so. The Central Bank suddenly opened spot goods, and Hengxing came up to buy vigorously, rising to beyond 8 taels. Dacheng even bought, for 8 taels and 8 qian.

Hengxing came to fight again, and in addition to the US silver market being closed tomorrow, there were still many buyers, rising to 50 taels or so. Goods and retail investors all came to sell, falling back by 2 taels.</p>
<p>Hengxing Fuchang continued to buy in, and rose again to outside 50 taels, for 50 taels and 3 qian. After this, Hengxing's purchase on behalf of the Central Bank had reached the quota, and it gradually showed weakness. Sanzhi and others sold out at high prices, gradually retreating to within 9 taels, and even more because Daxing Yong and Hengyu came to sell, they dropped to within 8 taels, for 7 taels and 6 qian. At this time, the market was forced to close. After struggling for a long time, it was extended to the closing at 747 taels and 7 qian. After the close, there were still many sellers, and buyers were lacking, so a low drop was seen.</p>
<p>Goods were auctioned at 7.5 taels, and finally traded to within 6 taels. The market was closed in the afternoon on Saturday. Checking the highest price for half a day was 761 taels and 9 qian, and the lowest price was 743 taels, a difference of as much as 18 taels and 9 qian. The result of the miserable half-day drop was a sharp drop of 11 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price did not move because the HSBC listing did not move. US exchange rates were still calculated at 28 yuan and 75. Alloy prices were 834 taels, 7 qian, and 8 fen. According to the closing price, about 87 taels were picked up, 12 taels less than the previous close. The book price for this month was 751 taels, and for April it was 748 taels.

<p>Total Number of Clearing House Transactions: The total number of transactions at the Shanghai United Reserve Committee Clearing House on March 4th was: silver dollars 1,001,422.39 yuan, exchange silver dollars 573,649.71 yuan, silver taels 527,727.06 taels, exchange silver taels 422,969.12 taels, totaling 2,900,477.13 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Deposit Interest Rate Discussion Set at 2.95 Discount</h3>
<p>The base rate for deposit interest in the previous month (February) could not be statistically determined due to the high daily fluctuations of silver split rates. Recently, the Standing Committee set the market price for deposit interest, and the public decided that the fixed market price should remain at a 2.95 discount as the standard, calculated for 28 days, as there were only 28 days that month. As for overdue interest, it will still be calculated by adding 4 liang and 5 qian to the base rate. Thus, the highest overdue interest will be 10 liang and 5 qian, it was said.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds: Minor Reaction After Frequent Rises</h3>
<p>丨Long Positions and Northern Merchants Have Already Emerged丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a slight change in the bond market situation at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, and the market price also experienced a slight reaction. This was a rebound after two consecutive days of rising. The underlying situation had not changed significantly. The earthquake in Japan had no initial connection to our public bonds. The opening of futures trading in the morning was delayed by fifteen minutes due to accounting reasons. At that time, the public bond market at the Commodity Exchange had already opened, and the market price was still high. Reduction of troops reached 52 yuan. When the Chinese merchants opened trading, market sentiment was not weak, but as many long positions were being unloaded and although some retail investors were buying, there were more sellers of No. 47 bonds, so the price only continued to rise by 3-5 jiao. The trend weakened as the day progressed. The competition between long and short positions was fierce during the auction of the unified tax, and as a result, there was no upward movement. Therefore, the unified tax fell by 3 jiao due to the shift in market sentiment. The second session was sluggish, and the northern merchants changed to selling again. Numbers 11 and 47 bonds continued to be sold, and the market price uniformly declined by 1-2 jiao to 7-8 jiao. Afternoon trading was clear, as is customary on Saturdays, and the market price was stable. However, it still fell slightly by 2-3 jiao. The closing price fluctuation was even smaller. Only the "Bian Yi" bonds fell by 4 jiao, and the unified tax fell by a little over 2 jiao. The supervisory tax remained stable, and other varieties were slightly better by 1-2 jiao. As a result, the market price uniformly declined slightly by 2-3 jiao to 8 jiao. Only the 18-Guan bonds rose by 1 jiao, and spot reductions of troops rose by over 3 yuan due to the long interval.</p>
<p>This is not yet a formal decline, and there may still be a round of upward pull. The total transaction volume was 7,550,000 yuan, including 15,000 yuan in spot transactions, 3,000,000 yuan in unified supervisory tax futures, and over 1,500,000 yuan in reductions of troops. Other varieties had several hundred thousand yuan each, and the entire six bonds had only 85,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Soars</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market experienced a surprising change on Friday. The initial opening was flat, but at 10:30 AM, short sellers began to cover their positions frantically.</p>
<p>Trading was unusually active, and the teletype was about two minutes behind. Stock prices soared,</p>
<p>with some rising as much as six dollars. At the same time, the situation on the small exchange also became firmer. Before long, the狂濤waves reached the commodity exchanges, with Chicago wheat surging by about two cents, and other grains also rising by as much as 20 points. German public bonds rose from two to six dollars, while U.S. public bonds fell to a new low for the year. It is said that the reason for the panic among short sellers was due to the government possibly imposing restrictions on short selling, but there was actually no such intention. The exchange announced that the discount rate was increased to 4%, and the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank also increased the rediscount rate to 3.5%. The amount of currency in circulation in the country has increased from 73,200,000 yuan to 672,000,000 yuan, an increase of about nine times. At the same time, cash outflow reached 11,600,000</p>
<p>yuan, and private savings increased by another 11,000,000 yuan. It is said that the interest rate for the reserve</p>
<p>bank to purchase bills from member banks has also risen to 4%. The banking crisis continues to grow, and as of today, 31 states have imposed restrictions on withdrawals. A total of 1,410,000 shares were traded today. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: U.S. Cotton Rising Overtly, Declining Covertly</h3>
<p>Standard Yarn and Cotton Enter Depressed State Again</p>
<p>The yarn market suddenly turned flat and depressed. Although U.S. cotton rose, the silver price was high, causing market sentiment to remain flat. The situation was chaotic, Japanese military aggression intensified, credit was tight, commerce declined, and sales became increasingly sluggish. As a result, when the market rose, there were fewer buyers. However, the bottom has dried up, and there are fewer speculators. Standard Man-mark declined by 5-6-7 qian. In the opening market, near-month contracts rose slightly, but in the second and third sessions, they tended to decline, and the situation was flat and depressed. Each month declined by 1, 2, 3, and 5 qian. In the afternoon, it was reported that there was not much actual demand, and each month declined by another 2, 3, 4, and 6 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 14,900 bales. Confirmed sales included 1,900 bales from Yuhang, 550 bales from Tongfu, 650 bales from Yichang, 500 bales from Chunji, and 450 bales from Xincheng. Purchases included 700 bales by Daji, 550 bales by Maoji, 900 bales by Tonghe, 750 bales by Taichang, and 500 bales by Yichang. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>May 1413 6　2,500Total　　184,500</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Only 300+ Bales: The current yarn turnover remains sluggish. According to statistics, all gangs purchased a total of 375 bales throughout the day. The market was flat and depressed, and the purchase volume of each gang was as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha 20 Xiamen 35 Shantou 65 Anqing 5 Tonghang 40</p>
<p>Guangdong 20 Luzhou 25 Nanyang 20 Sichuan 60</p>
<p>Datong 5 Fujian 9 Ningbo 内地 65</p>
<p>The cotton market turned soft again. Although U.S. cotton rose, the gold market plummeted, and the silver</p>
<p>price was high, resulting in an overt rise but a covert decline. Market sentiment was weak. In the afternoon, Indian cotton opened at 1,000 bales, and market sentiment was particularly affected. However, there was a lack of new speculators in the market, so the degree of change was extremely shallow. In general, it is difficult</p>
<p>to rise significantly, but the bottom goods are relatively scarce. There is a lack of confidence in the future of Indian cotton. As a result, business was very slow, it was said.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Slightly Lower: The Zheng Standard opened with market sentiment still strong due to the rise in U.S. cotton. However, there was a lack of new buyers. It was reported that the gold market had plummeted, and each month declined by 5 fen to 1 qian. In the afternoon, Indian cotton opened, and each month declined by another 5 fen to 1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 36,400 dan. Confirmed sales included 6,800 dan from Yuhang, 1,300 dan from Changhe, 1,300 dan from Yifeng, 1,500 dan from Delong, and 1,200 dan from Yuanxingchang. Purchases included 1,400 dan by Jifeng, 1,600 dan by Xinheng, 1,800 dan by Changhe, 1,100 dan by Tonghe, and 1,100 dan by Yuanda. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Rebounds by Over 20 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton rebounded strongly due to foreign merchant purchases, strength on Wall Street, and short covering. Futures rose by 20 to 23 points, and spot rose by 25 points. English cotton futures fell by 12 points, and spot fell by 15 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 17 points. Indian cotton was weak due to selling by Japanese merchants and European exporters, and speculators selling due to the U.S. financial crisis. Pingguoer fell by 1 rupee, Aomula fell by 3.25 rupees, and White fell by 3.5 rupees. Original telegram left.

<h3>U.S. New Cotton Fields Increase by 8.9%</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 3rd reported on the cotton market for the week, saying that the cotton market last week saw a sharp decline in trading due to the uncertainty of legal issues related to the banking crisis. However, Southern selling was extremely low, and the actual position was relatively stable. There was also a lack of liquidation of long positions, so the potential remained stable. The general public doubts whether President Hoover will approve Mr. Smith's proposal to reduce cotton production. Cotton trading was also limited. According to the disseminated news, the Cotton Corporation plans to reduce the cost of raw cotton to the lowest possible level this season. The soil condition is good, the damage to the fruit is also reduced, and the weather for opening is excellent. According to the Bureau of Planting Estimates, the area planted this season is zero, nine, two, six, zero, zero, zero acres, an increase of 8.9% compared to last season.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market: Customers Seeking Urgent Release at Slight Discount</h3>
<p>(Henan) Yesterday, the boatmen went on strike. Although there were many attempts to compare measures, etc., they have not been resolved for the time being. There is still no source arriving in Shanghai. Only a few ships in the river and goods from warehouses and factories were traded, but the sales were sluggish, and customers were eager to sell at a slight discount. Factory goods were still able to hold up. Beiqing from Yuhang Warehouse, calculated in wide bales, sold for 9 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 fen, it was said.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the only source from the river was Xiao Gang arriving in Shanghai number three or four. The direct sales of white glutinous rice were not smooth, and the market decreased by about 1 jiao. Thin glutinous rice was flat. Early rice was weak, sheep tip was slightly soft, du tip and customer tip were fixed, and there was not much change in yin yuan and white yuan.</p>
<h3>Clear and Firm Flour Market</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month showed good signs. Due to the quoted price of foreign wheat and the sharp increase of five or six jiao in Chicago, and about two jiao in Canada, the market sentiment was very good at the opening, about 1 fen higher than the closing price of the previous day. However, buyers were still not very active, and there were many floating sales, so at the close, it went back about 7 li and a half. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still flat at first, but after the second session, due to the attitude of the Tianjin gang, it had become stable. There were fewer floating sales of futures, and the turnover of spot goods had also become slightly smoother. Therefore, although the transactions in each session were still light, the market showed signs of improvement. As a result, this month rose by 1 fen compared to the previous day, April rose by 1 fen and a half, May rose by 1 fen, June rose by 1 fen and a half, July rose by 1 fen and 7 li and a half, and August rose by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Extremely Quiet Wheat Market</h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month was still as quiet as usual. There was no vitality in both sides. Only the current month was tight due to the rise in foreign wheat prices. It opened at three liang and two qian, calculated as 4 fen. There were still few transactions in the afternoon, falling back by 1 fen. For each month in the long term, only the transactions in July were still strong, and there were many short sales. As a result, the current month rose by 3 fen compared to the previous day, and July rose by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was extremely sluggish due to the continuous fall in the gold price. Today is Sunday, there are no shipments. The Sugar Association called for 15 liang, 3 qian, and a half for ordinary grade sand white sugar. There was a full of out and no in. However, high-grade AR was still priced at 15 liang and 6 liang due to the shortage of goods. Grade 20 medium sand and 89 Dutch 赤sugar were all priced at the original price. There were no transactions at all, and there were few openings in the board, it was said.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Jinshan Dried Branches Rising Steadily</h3>
<p>Jinshan dried branches have recently seen active sales and a shortage of sources, resulting in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, the market price has been steadily rising. Yesterday, it was reported that the vendors opened another batch, which was up by another three or four liang compared to the previous batch. The market feels緊俏, and there are signs of continued rise.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Price Cuts Began at Over 2,000 Pieces</h3>
<p>The oil market has been looking tired for a long time and persisted for many days, and there is still no sign of recovery. However, hard supporting is not a long-term solution, so yesterday they started negotiating sales, and the market price has dropped by six qian. The turnover is still average. After negotiation, the gradual use will be started first, and the price will be based on the actual large market after the sale is opened. The city traded 2,000 pieces yesterday, but although the market is being cleared, it is feared that the future situation will not be good.</p>
<h3>Metals: Large Bars of Lead Fall Another 1 Qian</h3>
<p>Large bars of lead fell another 1 qian yesterday. The estimated price of foreign lead is 11 liang and 7 qian and a half per load, and local lead is 11 liang and 6. Although the tea gangs added some purchases, the number was not large. The season is still far from new tea. The Tianjin gang reported that they would not buy, so the turnover was even fresher. The local lead arrivals were relatively strong, and the foreign lead stocks were also rich, so the market was difficult to rise. As the U.S. exchange rate increases, it is difficult to have good market sentiment, and it will be difficult to see a turnaround for the standards for a while.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: 58 Pieces of Anhui White Silk Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The white silk produced in Mu Town, Qingyang, and other places in Anhui Province is popular in India, France, and other places, but the production is not strong and the sources are sparse. Good wheels imported into the Yangtze River this morning and 58 pieces of Anhui white silk loaded from Datong arrived at the warehouse</p>
<p>for sale, it was said.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Please Pay Attention, Critics</h3>
<p>— Shiheng</p>
<p>It seems that two years ago, there were several days when newspapers printed a piece of news in large characters saying that five elementary school students, the youngest being eleven or twelve years old, and the oldest being fifteen or sixteen years old, had become obsessed with reading martial arts novels and the like. They agreed</p>
<p>to go to Mount Emei to practice Taoism, so they secretly hid the tuition fees given to them by their families. Once they decided on a city, they boarded the ship. However, because the youngest child was weak for a while, he started crying loudly, and the matter was discovered, and the children were led home by the adults. This happened in Shanghai. Shortly after that, I arrived in Hong Kong. One day, I saw a very similar incident in a Hong Kong newspaper. Martial arts novels have such an amazing appeal to Chinese children, which is truly unimaginable for us. In fact, it's not just children. There are countless adults in China whose thoughts and knowledge can be placed at the same level as children. Martial arts novels have the same amazing appeal to these adults as they do to children. No matter how much the "art for art's sake" people in the literary world despise such martial arts novels and refuse to admit that they are also a category of literature, they are to children and child-like ignorant people what the highest works of art are to men and women who have received higher education. And today, their influence still surpasses all new art products.</p>
<p>The majority of the masses of a nation, no matter how ignorant they are, always have their own readings, and those readings always dominate their lives and thoughts, and shape their view of life or the universe. Once the masses have been badly influenced by those inferior readings, they are like small insects caught by spiders. Even with great effort, it is difficult to save them. The readings of our people are as bad as they can be, and its power is as great as it can be. Today, I don't know how many millions or tens of millions of people have lost their lives in this spider web.</p>
<p>Many practical behaviors of the Chinese people, if analyzed in detail, are derived from the influence of inferior readings and can be seen anytime and anywhere. In the early years of the Republic of China, the people hoped that the emperor would reappear because there were too many stories in the folk readings or legends that the world would be peaceful once a true emperor was born in troubled years. Also, in the past few years in the north, the most admired figure among the general public was Wu Peifu. He became a hero of the people. Whenever there was a civil war with Wu Dashuai, everyone always hoped and predicted that he would definitely win. The reason for this is that in the folk readings, any hero who has private morality and is good at fighting should be worshiped. This is just an example that can be cited at random. People who pay close attention to society can see one or two records of social phenomena in the daily newspaper records.</p>
<p>Neglecting this social phenomenon of literature is the shame of those who strive for new literature, and especially the fault of general literary critics. To be a literary critic today, one cannot just do book work, formula research, and mysterious interpretations. Observing such social phenomena can write the best criticism, otherwise criticism will have no future and no social influence.</p>
<p>Now, the folk readings that support feudal forces are still rampant, and the negative social impact they have is still not reduced at all. People who work hard for new literature should not stand idly by. Please pick up a sharp pen and dissect it like a doctor holding a knife to a corpse. Especially when a clear social phenomenon is discovered, please do not let it go, please seize it and make sharp criticisms.</p>
<p>This is what I want to ask our critics to pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Lazy Learning Praise</h3>
<p>— Li Xiu</p>
<p>In spring, I often encounter some children in the countryside by the fence, tearfully carrying their satchels and reluctantly inching towards school. What they call a school is actually still a private school; just like wearing foreign socks on bound golden lotuses, calling them natural feet. They look back at their homes every time. Seeing that scene, one can't help but feel great pity. I beg all the virtuous parents in the world to be merciful and never let the greedy thought of seeking wealth and status move them to send their pampered children to school.</p>
<p>The Lantern Festival has just passed, and the gongs and drums of the flower lanterns are still faintly ringing in my heart. Reading, how can it be as flavorful as setting off firecrackers?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I walked past the school gate. Two tiger head plaques with the words "School Grounds" and "No Idlers Allowed" were hung at the gate. I am not one of the busy people, so naturally I was not on the list of "No Entry". I couldn't help but step inside to take a look. Oh! Many small faces covered in ink were lined up in front of the desks. Dark, shiny eyes peeked over. The teacher was scowling and slapping hands, and the child's face was covered in snot and tears. This look was enough to make one's heart jump and run away. That teacher even stood up, and I thought he must be coming to chase me.</p>
<p>What good is reading? Pointlessly getting beaten with bamboo sticks. I remember when my childhood enlightenment teacher wrote the words "It is better to send your son to school than to have gold in the house" and taught me to copy them, and taught me to read "There are thousands of Zhong of grain in the book..." But this lie was quickly broken. Not knowing how to read can still allow one to live a quiet life. Knowing how to read but not understanding that words are designed to compliment masters and say good things for masters will lead to a violent death. Those Confucian scholars who were buried by the Qin Dynasty, those scholars of the Donglin and Fushe societies, those men in the many literary inquisitions of the Manchu Dynasty, the recent Lin Baisu, Shao Piaoping, and the recent Liu Yusheng and others, if they had practiced knife and spear and did not go to shake their pens in the first place, who knows if they would not have achieved success? With power, there would be no fear of lacking learned Confucians who sell their bodies to say nice things for you and sing your praises! Why send yourself to your death in vain?</p>
<p>Which elegant emperor did not lose his country, which founding emperor was not a brave warrior? You may be talented and learned, but you can only be a prime minister, and paying attention to the loyalty of the emperor cannot get rid of the nature of a slave. Precisely:</p>
<p>Essays have been followed for thousands of years, causing one to frown upon seeing them.</p>
<p>All things in the world are high-quality, only reading is low-class!</p>
<p>I only hope to skip school today, and I do not seek to become a Buddha or ascend to heaven.</p>
<h3>On the Word "Refinement"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhou</p>
<p>The origin of the term "refinement" is well-known to everyone... finally, Jia Dao chose the word "knock" because it sounded more resonant.</p>
<p>Being more resonant is certainly good; however, in my opinion, there is another, more important reason, which is that</p>
<p>*The monk knocks at the moonlit gate*</p>
<p>The artistic conception of this line of poetry is enriched by the word "knock."</p>
<p>"The monk pushes at the moonlit gate" is merely a monk returning to the temple late, pushing the mountain gate under the moonlight, about to enter the temple; a very ordinary event, which isn't worth a poet writing into a line of poetry? ... If this monk were the tattooed monk Lu Zhishen from *Water Margin*, and the door he was pushing wasn't a temple gate, then perhaps there would be a bit of novelistic interest.</p>
<p>As for the line of poetry "The monk knocks at the moonlit gate," we can infer from it that the monk is indeed returning to the temple very late, and the people in the temple thought he wasn't coming back tonight, and closed the temple gate... Moreover, the temple is the quietest of places, and the late moonlit night is the quietest of times, and suddenly there is the sound of knocking on the door, initiated by a person who usually enjoys tranquility... All these associations are evoked by the word "knock." Literature is precisely about being rich in associations.</p>
<p>The word "knock" is not only more resonant in pronunciation, but the associations it evokes are also a resonant breaking of the silence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the word "push" does not evoke any response in the reader's emotions... The word "knock" is full of anticipation, placing the reader in the position of the monk at that time, waiting with him, in the deep moonlit night, for the temple gate to open, amidst the knocking sound that stirred his self-esteem, with its echoes still rippling in the moonlit scene.</p>
<h3>Accommodation and Food for Students Studying in Paris</h3>
<p>— Fusheng</p>
<p>Like a dream, I lived abroad for seven or eight years. It's almost been a month since I returned home, but I'm still muddled, as if I haven't woken up from the dream. My old classmate Li Liewen asked me to write something for the "Free Talk" section. What should I write? It seems that it's not easy to speak freely in China these days; one careless word and your head might be at risk. When I left Paris, many friends told me... "After you return to China, it's not like being abroad where you can say whatever you want; you have to be very careful with your words!" So, even though I'm writing for "Free Talk," I think I should be cautious. I won't talk about anything else now, just the accommodation and food situation for Chinese students in Paris. Surely, that won't be a crime, right?</p>
<p>Accommodation</p>
<p>I can't remember which magazine I saw an editor writing in "Editor's Notes," introducing a great work by a student in France, saying... "Mr. XX is currently living at the University of Paris studying sociology," etc. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw it. This editor probably thought that the University of Paris, like universities in China, has large dormitories attached for students to live in? If he talked to a few more people who have returned from Paris, he wouldn't make such a joke.</p>
<p>Originally, the faculties of "Letters," "Law," and "Science" of the University of Paris are all located in the central area of Paris, on the left bank of the Seine River in the Fifth Arrondissement (the old Latin Quarter). The buildings are large, but only used for classes, experiments, and consulting books, and no student can live inside. All students of the University of Paris live scattered in hotels and apartments (Pensions) in the Fifth and Sixth Arrondissements near the university, in convenient places for transportation outside the city, or in the "University City" (Cite Universitaire) near the Porte d'Orleans.</p>
<p>The "University City" is a collection of buildings, with each country building one, on land donated by the French government. In order to boast of their national power and promote their culture, various governments competed to erect magnificent buildings there at great expense to provide accommodation and recreation for their own students and a portion of French students. Currently, there are successful houses for France, England, America, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Canada, Argentina, Japan, Annam, etc., which can accommodate more than 30,000 students in total (with foreign students accounting for about 10,000). I heard that the French government had previously designated a piece of land for the Chinese government to build a Chinese house there, but year after year, the Chinese government never came up with the money, so the French government took the land back and gave it to another country.</p>
<p>Chinese students in Paris, because their government is not ambitious and they don't have the fortune to set foot in the "University City," mostly live in the old Latin Quarter and in places outside the city such as L'Hay-les-Roses, Bourg-la-Reine, and Laplace.</p>
<p>Chinese students living in the Fifth and Sixth Arrondissements mostly live in some dirty old hotels. Slightly habitable rooms in these hotels cost 350 to 400 francs per month (about 70 to 80 yuan in national currency). Few Chinese students can afford such rooms; most Chinese students live in a narrow "attic room" (Mansarde). The so-called "attic room" is the "false third floor" of many newly built lane houses in Shanghai, located on the top floor of the building, with a sloping roof instead of a flat ceiling. Buildings in Paris are usually seven or eight stories high, and these dirty old hotels do not have modern elevator facilities, so living in such a top-floor "attic room" requires particularly good leg strength. Chinese students generally do not have such leg strength, but because the rent for this type of room is cheaper (about 40 yuan per month in national currency), they have to endure it, carrying heavy schoolbags every day, panting from descending from heaven to hell, and then climbing from hell to heaven.</p>
<p>But there are many conveniences for those who live in this Latin Quarter heaven... First, it is convenient to attend classes, especially for those of us who study science and have to do experiments every day, it is essential to live near the school; second, it is convenient to have fun. If you like to listen to operas, listen to music, dance, watch movies, or sit in cafes, then naturally you have to live in the city. I remember when Liewen was in Paris, because he liked to listen to operas and music, he lived in the Latin Quarter for a long time. Although he hadn't yet entered heaven, he lived in a room on the sixth floor, which can truly be said to be "close to heaven"!</p>
<p>As for those who don't have to go to class every day and don't have a strong interest in theater and music, like those who are solely preparing their doctoral dissertations, it is naturally better to live outside the city. Because houses outside the city are almost half the price of those in the city, and you can find a comfortable room in a French home for more than 200 francs per month. Moreover, these rooms are mostly located on the first floor (because houses outside the city rarely exceed two floors), which can save you the trouble of climbing up and down. The houses are often attached with small gardens, and you can open the window to breathe fresh air that cannot be breathed in the city of Paris. If you live on a small hill near L'Hay-les-Roses, the scenery is even more spectacular, giving people the impression of a paradise. The philosopher (?) Li Shicen, who caused a sensation in the Shanghai newspapers last year with his love affair with Miss Tong, enjoyed such romantic bliss there with his Miss Luo a few years earlier.</p>
<p>Since there are these benefits outside the city, Chinese students in Paris often live in the city when school starts, and then move outside the city when summer vacation comes and school is out. Those rich young masters who have money to travel to Switzerland and Italy, of course, are another matter.</p>
<h3>The Story of a Black Girl Seeking God (XVII)</h3>
<p>— Written by George Bernard Shaw, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"One, lacks one, lacks two, lacks three, lacks four."</p>
<p>They all clapped their hands. "Good!" one shouted. "Newton!" another said. "Leibniz!" a third said. "Einstein!" a fourth said. Then they all said together, "Excellent! Excellent!"</p>
<p>"I have something to tell you," said the lady anthropologist of the tour group. "The next great civilization will be a black civilization. White people are useless. They know it, so they're rushing to commit suicide."</p>
<p>"Why are you making such a fuss over such a small thing?" said the black girl. "Why can't you white people develop and be as diligent as we black people? When I first saw glass beads, I thought they were really excellent; but before long I was familiar with such things. As soon as one of you says some silly phrase, you shout 'excellent, excellent.' The strangest thing you have is your guns, and you must still wait for God to make it easier to understand how to make guns. But you don't have God in your hearts. You only care about guns. You used guns to make us slaves. Then, because you were too lazy to fire the guns, you handed the guns over to us and taught us to fire them for you. After a while, because you're too lazy to make guns yourselves, you'll teach us to make guns again. You understand how to make wine. Wine is something that makes people forget God, clouds their conscience, and makes killing seem like a pleasant thing. You sell us this wine and teach us how to make it. At the same time, you steal our land, force us to starve, and make us hate you like snakes. What will the outcome be? You kill each other so quickly that by the time our warriors are filled with your magic wine and hatefully kill you with your own guns, the remaining ones will be too few to resist. Afterwards, our warriors will also kill each other like you, unless they are stopped by God. Oh, I know where I can find him! Will none of you help me? Does none of you care?"</p>
<p>"Our guns saved you from man-eating lions and trampling elephants, didn't they?" said an irritable gentleman, who had felt the previous conversation was too profound.</p>

<p>After the Fall of Chengde, Our Army Deploys a Line of Defense Outside Gubeikou</p>
<h3>The Central Government Convened an Emergency Meeting to Decide on Measures</h3>
<p>Large Forces Advance from Gubeikou to Luanping</p>
<p>All Transportation Brigades of the Military Affairs Commission Exit to Work</p>
<p>(Beiping) The entire front of the Rehe war was lost without a fight. Tang Yulin led his troops out of the provincial capital and retreated west to Luanping for three days and nights, allowing 128 Japanese soldiers to occupy Chengde on the morning of the 4th. When the news came, all parties in Beiping were extremely indignant, especially the diplomatic circles were shocked. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Currently, our army has main forces deployed in layers along the line of defense outside the various passes of the Great Wall. Large forces are successively advancing from Gubeikou to Luanping, with the vanguard reaching Luanping. Two divisions, including those of Wang Yizhe, are stationed at Gubeikou. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chifeng was captured by the enemy's Motegi Brigade on the morning of the 3rd. Zhang Zuoxiang is at Gubeikou. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A merchant who arrived in Beiping from Chengde today said that on the dawn of the 3rd, Chengde received news of the fall of Chifeng. The headquarters of a certain army corps was tense for a time. Tang prepared to lead one brigade and one regiment to retreat towards Fengning, and left Chengde before dusk. Zhang Zuoxiang advanced towards Gubeikou. At the same time, rumors spread among the people that so-called leaders from all walks of life rushed east overnight to welcome the enemy. The Japanese army's strategy in annexing Rehe is to exploit the people's anti-Tang sentiment, so the enemy army is sometimes guided by a small number of people. Despite our best efforts to appease them, Tang's deep-seated resentment could not be redeemed, which is truly regrettable. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Tang's escape, the supply of provisions and ammunition for our entire line became a major problem. The Transportation Brigade of the Military Affairs Commission has already dispatched all its personnel to Xifengkou to maintain the route to Pingquan Sanjiazi. On the morning of the 4th, another engineer battalion left Gubeikou, rushing day and night to build a motor road from Kelatun to Bancheng to facilitate military transport. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Tang withdrew from Chengde, a telegram was sent to Beiping saying that the reason for the withdrawal and the army's failure to fight was due to a shortage of both grain and pay, which made it impossible to maintain the situation. Sun Dianying's troops in Chifeng have concentrated around the besieged city. After Tang withdrew from Chengde, gunshots were heard inside and outside the city at midnight on the 3rd. The advance team of 128 Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived on the morning of the 4th. This morning at 10 o'clock, Japanese troops successively entered the city. It is said that the Japanese troops are the Suzuki Kawahara Brigade of the 8th Division, which bypassed the mountains from Jianping and directly approached Chengde. The Motegi cavalry brigade and the Matsuda brigade of the North Road are also successively advancing along the Chifeng Avenue towards Gude. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Chengde fell, Tokyo immediately sent out propaganda, saying that our army had completely withdrawn from Rehe, and that after our entire line collapsed, the Japanese army would pursue to the various passes of the Great Wall and then stop advancing. This is malicious propaganda intended to disrupt our army's morale. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Key members of the Central Government held an emergency meeting at 9 a.m. this morning to discuss national defense matters, given the large-scale invasion of Chengde by the Japanese bandits. Decisions were made on defense and counter-offensive plans, and a telegram was immediately sent to the generals in North China to comply. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) All circles in the capital were saddened and outraged to learn of Tang Yulin's abandonment of Chengde. According to a certain key figure, the result of the Rehe War was unexpected. However, the people of our country must not lose heart because of this, and the whole country should unite to support each other and work together to recover the lost territory. This is not a difficult task. Since the matter is already thus, everyone must remember the disaster of national subjugation and family destruction, and rise up to save the country. The government has ordered He Yingqin to go north to preside over the anti-Japanese military affairs in North China with Acting Chairman Zhang. It is expected that they arrived in Beiping on the 5th. As for how the Central Government will deal with Tang for his responsibility of defending the territory, it is under discussion and there will be a serious indication. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Beiping Military Affairs Commission Resolved to Request Punishment of Derelict Generals</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Orders the Arrest of Tang Yulin</p>
<p>Zhang Zuoxiang Returned to Beiping Last Night</p>
<p>Zhang Sent Military Police to Strictly Inspect the Troops Entering Gubeikou</p>
<p>There is a Saying that the Defeated Rehe Army Was Forced to Retreat to Chahar</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Affairs Commission held a meeting today, and the commissioners expressed extreme indignation at Tang's abandonment of his duties. It was decided to send a telegram to the Central Government, requesting that the generals who retreated from Rehe without a fight be punished. The telegram was sent after the meeting. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin led more than a thousand guards to Luanping, and there are rumors that he will go to Chahar. Zhang Xueliang is extremely dissatisfied with Tang's abandonment of his duties and escape, leading to the loss of Chengde. He has submitted a request to the Central Government to issue an arrest warrant. At the same time, he has also requested the Central Government to issue arrest warrants for the generals who failed to support the volunteer army. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Zuoxiang arrived in Beiping last night. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang's retreat without a fight has affected the overall situation in Rehe. Zhang Xueliang dispatched 800 military police and two divisions of troops yesterday and today to strictly inspect the troops and volunteer army entering Gubeikou. On the one hand, he reported to the Central Government that any military personnel who retreat will be dealt with according to military law. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Zuoxiang, Commander-in-Chief of the Border Defense Army, took responsibility for the failure of the Rehe Army and resigned from Zhang Xueliang last night. Zhang Xueliang has also decided to telegraph the Central Government to investigate himself. (5th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang formally ordered the arrest of Tang Yulin yesterday. Also, since Tang had fled from Chengde to Luanping, he telegraphed the garrison in that area to arrest him, but Tang disappeared after fleeing into Luanping. (5th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's army, which was deployed at Gubeikou to prevent the retreating army of Rehe, engaged in a fierce battle with the Rehe army for two hours, defeating them. At 4 p.m. on the 4th, the gate of the Great Wall at Gubeikou was closed. As a result, the Rehe army and the volunteer army were pressed from the north by the Japanese army and prevented from advancing from the south by Zhang's army, and a large force retreated along the Great Wall towards Chahar. (5th Telegraph)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Has Arrived in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) He Yingqin and Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Tianjin at 7:30 on the 4th. Yu Xuezhong came to the station to welcome them. Reporters boarded the train to interview them. He asked whether the loss of Chengde was indeed true, because it was indeed an unexpected event. He continued, "I am coming north to take a look. I cannot determine how long I will stay in Beiping. The country should maintain the dignity of law and order, and the generals who retreated without a fight should be severely punished." (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Sent Wang Shuhan to the Capital</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang sent Wang Shuhan south to report on the military situation in Rehe. He arrived in the capital on the morning of the 5th and consulted with key figures on everything. He will fly to Jiangxi on the morning of the 6th to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and ask for instructions on all matters. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Stone River Front is Quiet</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Stone River front is quiet. An enemy plane arrived at Jielingkou at 4 p.m. on the afternoon and left after reconnaissance for a moment. A train of armored vehicles arrived at Yu Pass, and 300 more troops were added, and the situation is tense. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Our Army at Lingyuan Retreats to Sanjiazi</h3>
<p>Wan Fulin Issues Emergency Military Orders</p>
<p>Those Who Retreat Will Be Punished According to Military Law</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kuancheng Telegraph, Wan Fulin personally rode a small motorcycle to Sanjiazi, west of Lingyuan, to supervise the troops. The local line of defense is solid. Wan issued an emergency military order to the officers and soldiers on the front line on the 3rd, stating that those who retreat will be punished according to military law. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kuancheng Telegraph, the enemy's route to Lingyuan is indeed the main force, and its weapons and strength are superior. There are traitors guiding them everywhere, and their actions are agile. On the evening of the 3rd, the enemy's Kawahara Brigade again increased its strength to Jianping. Tang's army retreated without a fight, and the enemy pursued straight to Pingquan. Our counter-offensive troops were afraid of being attacked and retreated to Sanjiazi to wait for an opportunity. The enemy's motorcade advanced towards Naerdeng and encountered us in a fierce battle. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. A certain regiment of our Yu Division was almost completely wiped out. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kuancheng Telegraph, on the morning of the 2nd, Japanese infantry and cavalry, about one division in strength, launched a fierce attack on Lingyuan. At noon on the 2nd, the enemy's Hattori Brigade of the south of Lingyuan also broke out from Heishanzui. The two enemy routes combined and advanced towards Lingcheng. On the evening of the 2nd, enemy soldiers employed by Chinese traitors were discovered at Daomagou, Shanzuizi, 12 miles south of Lingyuan City, firing guns in all directions towards Lingyuan. On the evening of the 2nd, the situation in Lingyuan was chaotic, and the enemy took the opportunity to attack Ye Baishou. A certain regiment of our army was ambushed, and the entire regiment was wiped out. Lingyuan City was exclusively guarded by Yu Zhaolin's Brigade. Our Lingyuan-Pingquan communication line has been cut off. Wan personally led two regiments and a combined force of cavalry and artillery to launch a counter-attack on the evening of the 2nd. At the same time, Wang Yongsheng's Brigade increased its strength to the front line. That night, the enemy troops were repelled, and the original position was restored on the 3rd. At 10 a.m., the enemy launched another fierce attack, with many tanks and armored vehicles. Our army waited for the enemy to attack to a distance of 70 to 80 meters before suddenly jumping out of the trenches and engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. From the morning to the evening of the 3rd, the enemy launched more than a dozen fierce attacks, but none succeeded. All the soldiers were willing to die rather than retreat. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Beiping's military telegrams are still connected to Pingquan, Lingyuan, Ershijiazi, etc. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At Lingyuan, four brigades of the direct troops of Wan Zhang fought fiercely with the enemy for several days and suffered a setback at one point. When the reinforcements of the unit arrived, they recaptured the original position. However, due to the reinforcement of the enemy's main force, they have retreated to Sanjiazi. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying was extremely indignant after receiving news of the fall of Chengde near Chifeng. Sun will be in the same tragic situation as Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen. Several reporters from the Tianjin Yishi Dagong and Beiping newspapers in Rehe were also captured. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in Tianjin Prepare for an Emergency</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military unit stationed in Tianjin held a meeting on the evening of the 4th and decided that from the 5th to the 10th, all the army would prepare for an emergency situation. It is widely rumored that the Japanese army will advance west from Yu Pass to intercept the troops retreating from Rehe. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, is Inaugurated</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Speech Fully Recognizes the Truth of the Situation</p>
<p>The Government Regards Response as Wartime Emergency Work</p>
<p>Reorganize National Natural Resources to Increase Farm Prices</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - In the past two days, a very large number of people have come to the capital to observe the inauguration ceremony of the 32nd President of the United States. The police took extraordinary precautions today to protect the new president, in view of the recent events in Miami. Detectives were mixed in the crowd everywhere, and well-known extremists and unscrupulous elements were especially noticed by the police. People were not allowed to peek from the roofs of buildings along the streets where the new president passed, and those who applied for tickets to the ceremony were subjected to strict checks. Troops and police were stationed at all important locations. Before his inauguration, Roosevelt led his cabinet members to St. John's Church next to the White House to seek God's blessing. After the religious ceremony, Roosevelt and Hoover rode in the same car from the White House to the Capitol, at 11 a.m. The old and new presidents were both dressed in morning suits and top hats. Six cars followed behind the car, and cavalry followed closely behind them. Mrs. Roosevelt and Mrs. Hoover sat together in the second car. After arriving at the Capitol, Hoover immediately entered the President's office to work. His last act in office was to veto the Smith Cotton Act, which aimed to reduce American cotton fields in 1933. Roosevelt then stepped into the auditorium to thunderous applause. Roosevelt raised his right hand before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and announced the oath to faithfully execute the office of President and protect the Constitution. Roosevelt then delivered his inaugural address, saying that he was certain that the only thing the United States needed to worry about was unreasonable and irrational panic. This kind of panic can make efforts to turn danger into safety ineffective. The current gray realities of falling prices, rising taxes, increasing unemployment, and sluggish markets are all before us. It would be foolish optimism to deny them. Now is the time to frankly admit the truth and think about how to respond. The primary and greatest task of rescuing millions of unemployed people is half the government's own direct efforts, regarding this as wartime emergency work, and half the reorganization of national natural resources. At the same time, we must find ways to make good use of the land to increase the value of agricultural products, so as to increase farmers' purchasing power for urban products. On the one hand, strict supervision should be exercised over the banking industry, credit and investment to prevent the use of other people's money for their own speculative activities, and sufficient and stable currency supplies should be planned. All of these are necessary measures in the process of moving towards recovery. He will propose to the specially convened Congress detailed plans regarding the above-mentioned framework. He will spare no effort to restore world commerce by organizing international economics. However, domestic emergency measures cannot wait for international events to be completed. An immediate need for action, or perhaps extraordinary actions, are necessary, so he is prepared to propose to the country a plan of contingency, and within his constitutional authority, to seek ways to facilitate this plan. But if Congress cannot adopt it, and national affairs are urgent, then he will not avoid the clear path of his current responsibility. He will ask Congress to give him the only tool to deal with the crisis, namely the authority to fight the emergency situation, which is as great as the authority granted to the president when an enemy invades. Cheers were repeated when Roosevelt spoke.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - Before Roosevelt delivered his inaugural address, the new Vice President Garner had already held the inauguration ceremony in the Senate. Observers included the new and old presidents, new and old cabinet members, and diplomats. The supervisor of the oath was the retired Vice President Curtis. Curtis served the country for 38 years and is now retiring. Curtis served as a Congressman for 14 years, a Senator for 20 years, and Vice President for 4 years. Now, as he leaves his post, he is inevitably moved and sheds tears.</p>
<h3>Hoover and Roosevelt Discuss Gold Export Ban</h3>
<p>Considering Abolishing Cash Payments</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th – A Washington correspondent for the New York Daily News reports that before the new president's inauguration ceremony, President Hoover and key figures like Roosevelt considered abolishing cash payments or implementing a gold export ban as an emergency measure.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th – Senator Glass met with Roosevelt for twenty minutes, followed by secret talks between the new Treasury Secretary Woodin and the new Secretary of State Hull.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 4th – President Roosevelt issued a declaration to the nation, stating that to cope with the national panic, he would request Congress to grant him full powers as in wartime, and that he would soon convene Congress for an emergency session. The new cabinet of President Roosevelt has been approved by the Senate.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 4th – Before leaving office, President Hoover approved official business, signing all the bills passed by Congress. However, he vetoed the draft law requesting a reduction in cotton production for 1933.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Meets with Paul-Boncour, French Attitude Unchanged</h3>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 4th – Tonight, the French representative Paul-Boncour departed for home. Before leaving, he consulted with Henderson, the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, regarding the progress of the Disarmament Conference. He then met with Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative to the League of Nations, and Hu Shize, the Chinese Minister to Switzerland. The purpose of the Chinese representative's visit to Paul-Boncour was to inquire about the French government's opinion on the ongoing situation in Rehe. At the last meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly, Gu Weijun, commenting on the unanimous adoption of the report by the Committee of Nineteen, requested the League of Nations to implement the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant. It is believed that the Chinese representative wanted to ascertain France's intentions regarding sanctions and the implementation of an embargo on arms shipments to the Far East. According to Havas, Paul-Boncour replied to the Chinese representative only that France would adopt the same attitude as the member states of the League of Nations and the United States.</p>
<h3>US Government Holds Special Meeting to Address Severe Banking Crisis</h3>
<p>Only South Carolina Unaffected by the Crisis</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th – President Hoover convened a special meeting with Treasury Secretary Mills this morning. It is widely believed that the government will take immediate action regarding the banking crisis.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th – More than thirty states in the United States have adopted measures to restrict cash withdrawals from banks. Government relief seems imminent. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) announced today that banks in states restricting withdrawals, if lacking sufficient cash but possessing</p>
<p>adequate collateral, could borrow cash from the RFC. Meanwhile, urgent measures to address the situation have been submitted to both houses of Congress. The House Banking Committee is prepared to convene to consider the legislative proposal. The plan proposed by the Senate advocates establishing postal savings and authorizing the new president and the Comptroller of the Currency to take any measures deemed necessary to protect deposits. Several banks are devising ingenious plans to meet the demands of business exchange mediums. The Tennessee Clearing House is creating a method for banks to issue their own banknotes, ranging from one to twenty dollars, so that depositors can withdraw a little more, and banks can meet their obligations. The RFC's requirement for sufficient collateral for loans has perplexed many in the financial world, as banks with sufficient collateral would not face difficulties in securing loans. It is generally expected that the RFC will eventually be flexible in its handling of the situation, otherwise many banks will never have the opportunity to seek loans from the RFC.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th – Only South Carolina nationwide has not been affected by bank closures or restrictions on withdrawals. National finances and commodity markets are currently closed.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th – Banking leaders in major cities are preparing to find solutions to the problems caused by depositor withdrawals during the bank holiday. Although the bank holiday is nominally not</p>
<p>national, its scope and effect are equivalent to a national one. Although the Federal Reserve Banks are not part of the state banking system, it is generally expected that they will also close during this bank holiday. Securities and commodity markets will also be closed. New York Governor Lehman made few comments after issuing the bank holiday proclamation. When asked if the two-day holiday would be enough to restore normalcy, Lehman replied, "I hope so." Public opinion is greatly confused about the steps to be taken in the future, but it is generally expected that President Roosevelt will soon convene a special session of Congress and will first strive to discuss plans to ease the overall situation. There is much talk now that what the nation urgently needs today is higher prices, which seems achievable only through currency inflation and free circulation of currency. The new president's inaugural address did not indicate a willingness to suspend cash payments, but it is widely believed that this measure may be implemented to avoid being forced to do so due to domestic withdrawals and hoarding. The public does not believe that foreign withdrawals will force the United States to abandon the gold standard. However, a ban on cash exports is now a possible measure, so that American businesses and individuals can no longer transport cash to places like Canada for deposit. Currency inflation would reduce the value of the gold dollar in foreign currency terms, but unless the gold standard is abandoned, there would be no significant changes in international financial relations.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 4th – During the bank closure period, exchange and securities markets are all closed. Today, American</p>
<p>cotton markets are also closed. The bankers' committee, which decided to temporarily suspend trading in the foreign exchange market this morning, is scheduled to reconvene on Sunday morning to review the situation based on</p>
<p>news from New York and then decide whether to reopen the foreign exchange market. At that time, foreign exchange business will at least be restricted. Florida and North</p>
<p>Dakota have also announced bank closures today. Among the forty-eight states in the United States, only Montana, Colorado, one of the Dakota states, and South Carolina have not yet announced bank closures. A senior official of the previous Republican government claimed that during the meeting between Roosevelt and Hoover yesterday, they discussed the federal government guaranteeing 50% of bank deposits.</p>
<p>Havas, Ottawa, 4th – The Canadian Finance Minister commented on the US banking crisis, saying that the position of Canadian banks is extremely sound and that they are able to meet all withdrawal requests comfortably.</p>
<p>Havas, Mumbai, 4th – The mail ship "Viceroy of India" set sail today carrying cash worth 2,950,000 rupees to London, about half of which is destined for New York.</p>
<p>Havas, Cherbourg, France, 4th – The mail ship "Magellan's Creek" arrived here from New York carrying forty boxes of American cash, worth 40 million francs, of which 35 million is destined for banks in Paris and 5 million francs for Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Soviet Reaction to Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th – German Chancellor Hitler's speech attacking the Soviet Union has aroused strong reaction in the Soviet Union. The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" published a sharp editorial today under the title "Fool." It says that even with threats and provocations, the leaders of the German Nazi Party have apparently not yet fully utilized the benefits of the elections. Therefore, in addition to batons and machine guns, they also</p>
<p>attempt to use the art of inferior arguments on the eve of the elections. On March 3, Hitler made a lengthy declaration of policy. Everyone hoped that he would mention his policy of saving Germany from the current dangerous situation. However, as a result, he only tried to use the Soviet Union as an example to prove the tragic results of communism. Although we do not want to answer Hitler's "analysis" of the Soviet Union's position, this time, even if the German politicians do not want to save all their people, at least they want to save the German state. Since Hitler has raised this "discussion," he should not complain about our forced reply. In recent years, the first-class economists of the capitalist world have come to the Soviet Union to study its economic development. Bolshevik scientists and politicians have also discussed the possibility of experimenting with the Soviet planned economy in capitalist lands. This is not because of the collapse of the Soviet economy and the difficulties of the Soviet people's livelihood, but because of the development of the socialist economy, the elimination of unemployment, and the progress of Soviet culture. Hitler did not mention a word about the construction of Soviet collective agriculture, but wanted to scare the Germans with stories about Soviet terror. Those who open the world must laugh at it. The Nazi Party members call themselves German patriots and think that they can better protect Germany's interests than others. However, the policies they implement are exactly the opposite, such</p>
<p>as organizing civil war and recklessly attacking the only Soviet Union that does not harbor hostility towards Germany. They believe that this is a smart act, but we believe that with these Nazi gentlemen as helmsmen, the ship of Germany may not reach its destination. The "Truth" published an editorial entitled "Clowns on Stage." It is claimed that everyone knows that the arson case in the German Parliament was a provocative act by the Nazi Party, and that all the circumstances prove that this was a repeat of the French Gogol case. Hitler has only been on stage for a month, but in this short period, the Nazi Party has done everything possible to oppress the German workers and peasants. In fact, the result of the German fascist forces inciting civil war only</p>
<p>increases the internal disputes in Germany, and the results of its foreign policy are even more tragic. In just thirty days, those who call themselves "representatives of the country" have clashed with the whole world and cannot cautiously choose the opposite path. The newspaper concludes that the party which crowns its name with the word "nation" is making Germany isolated and weakening its international position. Only this kind of clownish policy can isolate Germany. However, those who hold this kind of policy may not last long.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits from Jianning and Tinglian Flee to Guangchang Area</h3>

<h3>Anti-Revolution Discovered in Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Counter-Revolutionary Organization Lurking in the Agricultural Committee</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th – According to today's announcement by the State Political Department, seventy people have been arrested for engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. During the interrogation, they confessed that they were trying to sabotage agricultural production and create famine. State Political Department agencies have recently uncovered many counter-revolutionary sabotage organizations. These organizations are mostly lurking in some agencies of the Agricultural Committee and the State Farm Committee, especially in the agricultural areas of Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and Belarus. Most of their members are employees of state agencies and are from landlord families. Most of those arrested confessed to engaging in counter-revolutionary activities and attempting to sabotage agriculture. The methods they adopted were damaging locomotives and other agricultural machinery, accumulating weeds, carrying out strikes and arson in locomotive yards and linen mills to reduce production,</p>
<p>robbing collective farm grains, sabotaging planting and harvesting campaigns, and plotting to harm livestock, etc.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the Netherlands Says US and Japan Will Not Go to War</h3>
<p>Matsuoka's Visit to the Netherlands is Also of a Private Nature</p>
<p>Reuters, The Hague, 4th – The new Japanese ambassador to the Netherlands, Saito, told a Reuters interviewer here that Matsuoka's visit to the Netherlands is of a private nature. He will only stay for a few days before going to London. There is no issue of negotiating a mutual non-aggression pact between the two countries with the Dutch government. There is no reason for the Dutch East Indies to be alarmed. The oil station on Borneo is indeed of great importance to the Japanese Navy, but it will only become a matter of life and death when the United States and Japan clash in the Atlantic. He believes that there will never be a war between the United States and Japan, making it necessary for Japan to find ways to protect its oil supply. Japan has a friendly policy towards the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3>Germany Continues to Suppress Communists</h3>
<p>Reporter from Le Petit Parisien Expelled</p>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 4th – The Bavarian government is now following the example of the other German states, issuing an order to protect the country, in order to prevent the sabotage and violence of the Communist Party. The government now prohibits the Communist Party from holding meetings and demonstrations, and prohibits the Communist Party from issuing periodicals and distributing leaflets, etc. Reuters, Berlin, 4th – The government has ordered Lotte, the Berlin correspondent of Le Petit Parisien, to leave Prussia for two months from today, because the correspondent wrote an article saying that the Nazi Party deliberately set fire to the Reichstag and blamed it on the Communist Party. Lotte denied writing this article. The French Ambassador to Germany,</p>
<p>Poncet, visited the German Foreign Minister Neurath today, saying that the French government was very unhappy with Germany's move. Neurath replied</p>
<p>that he would try to persuade the Prussian Interior Minister Göring to deal with the matter leniently.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 4th – The National Executive Committee of the Independent Labour Party met today to review the political situation in Germany caused by Hitler's dictatorial measures. The party expressed solidarity with the German workers and advocated intensifying the British workers' movement to create a united front against "capitalist reactionary politics and fascism." The party will soon launch a large-scale demonstration with various sympathetic organizations to show that British workers are united with German workers in protesting Hitler's "terrorist policy."</p>
<h3>Britain Exerts Itself to Save the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>MacDonald and Simon Will Depart Soon</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – The British government's decision to have Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon go to Geneva to participate in the Disarmament Conference as soon as arrangements are made has been welcomed by all newspapers. London officials now believe that to avoid the failure of the Disarmament Conference, it is urgent to achieve tangible results in the near future. Therefore, new efforts must be made. People in London know that the consequences of the failure of the Disarmament Conference are endless, so they hope that other governments can cooperate to reverse this disaster. The date of the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary's trip to Geneva has not yet been</p>
<p>determined, but it is hoped that representatives of other governments who can make decisions will also attend the conference at the same time, so that the necessary results can be obtained quickly.</p>
<h3>Changsha's Air Defense Equipment and Training of Air Force Personnel</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Huang Fei, Director of the Hunan Aviation Office, believes that at this time of national crisis, Changsha is also an important town in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Air defense equipment is an urgent matter. He has specifically drafted two plans: "Minimum Air Defense Equipment for Changsha" and "Training Aviation Mechanics Personnel." He has submitted them to the provincial government for review. He Jian immediately accepted them and, in addition to asking the Hunan Aviation Patriotic Association to raise 1 million yuan first to handle Changsha's air defense equipment, the method of training aviation personnel was also approved according to the proposal. It is reported that the Aviation Patriotic Association decided to raise the equipment fee of 1 million yuan in the shortest possible time by mobilizing and collecting house donations, shop donations, business donations, and wealthy donations. Huang Fei's plan is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Air Defense Equipment: (1) Purchase two sets each of sound detectors and searchlights to prevent enemy attacks; (2) Purchase four sets each of anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, distributed in the suburbs and the Xinhe Airport to shoot down enemy aircraft and reduce damage; (3) Purchase six fighter planes so that they can deal with enemy aircraft and curb their ferocity; (4) Build temporary airports to avoid the eyes and ears of enemy aircraft, so that the fighter planes can achieve unexpected results. The above four items require more than one million yuan. Although the amount spent seems small, if there is no equipment at all, once enemy aircraft invade, allowing them to trample on us at will, the losses in an instant will be more than tens of millions. The previous events in Shanghai can be chilling.</p>
<p>Training Personnel: Training specialized personnel in aviation mechanics is an especially urgent task. Graduates from our country's aviation schools are absolutely insufficient in terms of national defense. There is also a severe shortage of mechanical personnel. Therefore, after the Shanghai Battle, the Changsha Aviation Office felt the lack of air force personnel in our country and tried its best to save on operating expenses to open flight and mechanical training classes, with more than 20 people in each class. After graduation, they can all take on work. The need for aviation personnel is even more urgent now. It is planned to train another 30 flight and mechanical personnel for application. In addition to 15 young military officers sent by the Ministry and various divisions, 15 high school graduates will also be recruited for the flight students. For the mechanical students, graduates of vocational high school mechanical science majors</p>
<p>are qualified. The graduation period is set for one year. Five aircraft of the Changsha Aviation Office will be designated as training aircraft. However, all kinds of equipment must be supplemented. It is planned to ask the government to issue a supplement of 30,000 yuan for materials, 6,000 yuan for factory application machinery fees, and increase</p>
<p>a foreign allocation of 20,000 yuan to purchase four engines for supplementation. In addition to transferring officers from various teams, several outstanding graduates from the current class will be selected as assistant instructors. If this is done, the cost will be small and the results will be great. (March 2nd)</p>
<h3>He Long Dies of Illness in Hubei Border Area</h3>
<p>Several Hundred Remnants Scattered in Hefeng</p>
<p>Hunan and Hubei Armies Continue to Encircle and Suppress</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Red bandit He Long, having fled from western Hubei into the Hunan border area, invaded Sangzhi, originally intending to invade Changde and Li County. After the 34th Division Commander Xi Renjie, Brigade Commander Zhou Xieqing, and others supervised the troops and blocked them, he was severely wounded and Sangzhi was recovered. He then led his remnants back to the Wufeng-Hefeng area on the Hubei border. Yesterday, Commander Gong and Sangzhi County Chief Hu Jinxin telegraphed, reporting that He Long had died of illness in Zoumaping, and the remnants were scattered in the Hefeng area. They are currently conducting a joint attack with Fan Jixi's troops in Hubei Province. Hu's telegram said, "I received a report from a secret agent sent to Hefeng, saying that He Bandit himself is now suffering from malaria in Zoumaping, emaciated and in a very dangerous state. There are still a small number of bandit teams in Hefeng City, and their vanguard is in the Wuyangguan area, fifty or sixty miles northeast of Hefeng City. There is a food shortage, and they are not full every day. Therefore, the power of the bandits is extremely scattered. If we advance with a large force, it will be very easy to eliminate them," etc. The county chief forwarded this information to Commander Gong Renjie and Brigade Commander Zhou Xieqing. As a result of the consultation, it was decided to attack Zoumaping with a large force. Now, all of Zhou's brigade has arrived at the front on the morning of Ganri (27th). Commander Gong also led Tian and Xiang's two regiments to follow up. All of Zhu's regiment and the subordinate county's local troops have advanced to the area of Legao, Kuzhu, and Baizhuping. After the majority of the troops are assembled, a general attack will be launched. The county chief leads the local troops and Yongshun Luo Bao'an Regiment Commander to defend the city and the areas of Chixi Mud, Huta, and Mopangjie, in order to maintain security in the rear. Hu Jinxin, County Chief of Sangzhi County, submits his findings and seal." Gong's telegram also said, "According to intelligence reports, the bandit leader He Long died of a dangerous illness in Zoumaping. There are now only several hundred armed bandits, and many bandits are dragging their guns and running away, etc.</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly eliminate them, in addition to transferring Brigade Commander Zhou to lead all of his troops to advance into the Hubei territory to encircle the bandit nests in Zoumaping, I also telegraphed Hubei troops under Fan Jixi to attack from Jiufeng and attack the bandit troops from both sides. I plan to go to the front to supervise the suppression today, and will continue to report on the rest. Gong Renjie, Commander of the 34th Division Suppressing Communists, bows and stamps."

<h3>Guangdong and Guangxi Armies Launch Large-Scale Anti-Bandit Campaign in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Headquarters Have Issued Symbols and Provided Military Expenses</p>
<p>Yu Hanmou Will Lead the Guangdong and Guangxi Armies Forward</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi are increasing their troops to carry out an anti-bandit campaign in Jiangxi, which is now</p>
<p>actively underway. The Guangdong army will use Yu Hanmou's 1st Army as the main force. In recent days, Yu has been consulting with Chen Jitang on the second phase of the anti-communist plan. It is reported that there are already concrete measures. Yu's troops stationed in southern Jiangxi will serve as the vanguard. It is estimated that the entire 2nd Division was originally in Nankang, and now the 5th Division's Wang Dao Regiment has also been ordered to move to the area between Xinfeng and Nankang. Yu's officers and soldiers who remained in the province were limited to return to their posts by the end of February, and will advance to the east bank of the Gan River in early March. Several thousand laborers recruited from various counties in Xijiang in recent days have already sent the strong</p>
<p>ones to the front for deployment first. As for grain and military supplies, they have also been transported north in a continuous stream. The headquarters of the First Army Group will be established in Da</p>
<p>Geng, to command at close range. As for those who are trending diagonally from northeastern Guangdong to eastern Jiangxi, the Independent 1st Division under Huang Renhuan will solely shoulder one side, to coordinate with the friendly forces in Sannan and western Fujian. Huang entered Fujian a few days ago to contact the 19th Route Army, and then went to Guangzhou to report on his mission. He will return to his original post to supervise the division within days. On the Guangxi army side, in addition to the 44th Division under Wang Zanbin and the Long Zhenyi Regiment, which has newly transferred from Guangxi Province to Beijiang and opened to Longnan on the Jiangxi border, Wang also returned to southern Jiangxi from Guangzhou on February 23 to reorganize the entire division and await orders. Recently, it has also been heard that the Guangxi army is increasing another division under Zhou Zihuang to reinforce its strength in southern Jiangxi. It has been found that Zhou's division is the 19th Division of the Fourth Army Group, stationed in the Guilin-Pingle area. Personnel are currently being dispatched by the headquarters of the Fourth Army Group to check it. As soon as the inspection is completed, it can set off from Pingle. In the future, Yu Hanmou will be the commander-in-chief of the Guangdong and Guangxi armies. As for the anti-communist banners, symbols, and armbands, they are issued by the Nanchang Anti-Bandit Headquarters and brought back by the Guangdong representative Yang Dezhao. As for the anti-communist military expenses, the central government has allocated 200,000 yuan. According to local sources, it will be difficult to achieve results if the army goes deep into the interior of Jiangxi to suppress the communists without sufficient grain and military supplies. Therefore, it is still necessary to raise 300,000 to 400,000 yuan this time to be effective.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that a large number of Jiangxi bandits recently fled south and attacked Xunwu from Junmenling, and a part invaded the border area of Xingning County in Guangdong Province. There were more than 3,000 bandits. According to reports, the local authorities immediately ordered the 13th Regiment of the 2nd Army stationed in Heping County to send a team to intercept them, and at the same time ordered the 8th Division of the 3rd Army to attack from Xingning. The division then dispatched the 22nd Regiment under Ye Shouyao to depart from Liuche, and the 23rd Regiment under Ouyang Xin to attack from Luogang. After arriving at Huangxiang, which belongs to Xunwu, on the morning of the 24th, they came into contact with the pseudo-22nd Division. Ye's regiment launched a fierce attack from three directions. By evening, Ouyang's regiment arrived to attack from both sides. The bandit forces were unable to resist, and the government forces recovered Xunwu. The bandit crowd fled back to Ruijin along Junmenling, and many were killed or injured along the way. Ye's regiment then advanced and stationed in Chenjiang, Liuche, Pingyuan, and other places to handle the aftermath. Ye Shouyao has already telegraphed a report yesterday. (February 28th)</p>

<h3>A Pitiful Country Girl Drifting Like Phoenix Feathers and Luan</h3>

<p>And Was Abducted to Shanghai for Sale</p>
<p>The World Is Full of Dangers, and People Have the Hearts of Beasts</p>
<p>Miss Chen Er From Taixing Is 29 Years Old. She Lost Her Father Early and Depends on Her Mother and Sister for a Living. Although She Is Engaged to Lou Haiqing, a Neighbor, Lou Is Drifting in Zhenjiang and Cannot Afford to Marry Her, Making Her Youth Pass in Vain. The Girl Is Quite Depressed. On January 22 of This Year, Two People, Lu and Wang, Secretly Came to the Girl's House, Claiming to Be Entrusted by Lou Haiqing to Invite the Girl to Zhenjiang to Hold the Wedding Ceremony. Miss Chen Er Did Not Have Time to Verify the Truth and Actually Left With Them Behind Her Mother and Sister's Back. When They Arrived in Jingkou, Lu and Wang Sold Her to a Brothel Established by the Chen Family in That Place. Those People Received 350 Yuan for Her Body and Divided the Spoils to Escape. From Then On, Miss Chen Er Began a Life of Flesh, Welcoming Newcomers and Seeing Off the Old, Entering the Crowd as a Husband.

Ling Did Not Pay Attention at the Time. Unexpectedly, the French Patrol Room Suddenly Received an Anonymous Letter Yesterday, Confidentially Reporting That Ling's Place Was a Kidnapping Organization. The Head of the Patrol Received the Letter and Immediately Ordered a Large Number of Detectives to Go to the Address to Arrest Him. When the Detectives Rushed to Ling, He Was Swallowing Clouds and Spitting Mist on the Third Floor. Suddenly Hearing That the Patrol Room Was Coming to Arrest Him, and With Dozens of Silver Dollars Still in His Pocket, He Had No Way to Escape. He Jumped From the Third-Floor Window and Fell Into the Courtyard, Suffering Serious Injuries to His Head and Feet. He Immediately Lost Consciousness and Was Sent to the Guangci Hospital on Jinshenfu Road for Treatment.</p>
<p>Due to Excessive Brain Damage, He Died at 7 AM This Morning. The Hospital Notified the Patrol Room to Carry the Corpse to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch of the Forensic Center and Reported That the Second Special District Court Would Examine It. It Is Reported That the Deceased Had a Total of Five Sons. The Eldest Son, Ziwen</p>
<p>, Runs a Carpentry Business. The Second Son, Tianpeng, Is Currently Serving as an Attendant in the Office of the Mayor of Wutie City. The Third Son, Gengen, Is in the Foreign Goods Business. The Fourth Son, Fugen, and the Fifth Son, Quanfu, Are Still Young.</p>

<h3>All Roads Lead There, but There is No Effect</h3>
<p>— Park</p>
<p>The Other Day, a Reporter Met a Friend Who Had Just Returned From Rehe. What I Was Eager to Know Was What the Result of His Trip Was. He Said, "All Roads Lead There, but There Is No Effect!" I Said, "Isn't That a Big Contradiction?" He Said, "Although This Is a Contradiction, It Is Indeed a Fact. What Can Be Done?" Then, He Said With Great Emotion, "Although That's the Case, We Still Have to Fight to the End. Then, There May Still Be Hope of Eliminating This Big Contradiction. Otherwise, This Ancient China Will Definitely Be Slowly Destroyed in This Contradictory State and Then Stop..." Below Is His Explanation of Why "All Roads Lead There, but There Is No Effect":</p>
<p>"We Rushed to Beiping and Tianjin This Time Because Rehe Was in Crisis to Do the So-Called 'Cheering Up' Work. We Were Very Welcomed Along the Way. After Arriving in Beiping and Tianjin, We Contacted All Parties. It Was Really 'All Roads Lead There,' and Everything Went Smoothly! But What Was the Final Result? It Was 'No Effect'! Then, What Was the Reason? It's Very Simple. A Group of Powerful Executors, On the Surface, Verbally, Answered With 'Exhausted Support, Definitely Do It,' But in Reality, They Had Other Plans, Had Plans in Mind, and Were Suspicious of Personal Rights. So, There Was No Determination to Implement It. This Is What Is Called 'All Roads Lead There, but There Is No Effect.' But the Independence of the Country and the Revival of the Nation Are Not Achieved by Them. It Depends on the Awakening of All of Our People to Do It Themselves. So, We Should Not Be Discouraged by This Contradiction. We Must Be Extra Spirited and Fight to the End."</p>
<p>After He Finished Speaking, Another Friend Next to Him Then忠告Me and Said, "Hey! These Words Are Not Suitable for Public Publication!" Yes, From the Perspective of Encouraging the People, These Words That Make People Unhappy Are Not Necessary to Publicly Publicize. But From the Perspective of Awakening the People, These Words Should Be Spoken Loudly and Specially. We Know That the Entire Chinese Society Now Is a Society Full of Big Contradictions. If We Want to Transform This Society, We Must First Fully Understand All the Contradictory Situations and How They Occurred and Where They Came From. Then, We Can Prescribe the Right Medicine and Sweep It Away. Isn't Mr. Sun Yat-sen's So-Called "Awakening the People" Also to Make All the People Fully Awake and Work Together to Solve the Contradictory Situation Under the Oppression of Imperialism and the Trampling of Bureaucrats and Warlords? The Reason Why This "Contradictory Situation" Can Be Called "Situation" for a Long Time and Does Not Become a Thing of the Past Is Because From the Government, Which Assumes the Responsibility of "Awakening the People," to a Group of Social Leaders Who Claim to Transform Society, and Even to People Who Are Respected and Admired by the People, They Have Not Faithfully Done the Work of "Awakening the People" and Understanding This "Contradictory Situation." They Are Slowly Following the Same Old Path, Which Has Led to the Current Situation of the Country's Destruction and the Family's Demise. Do We Still Want to Self-Deceptively "Keep It a Secret" Now? No, We Must Fully Publicize All the Contradictory Situations in This Entire Society, Awaken This Entire Nation That Is on the Verge of Danger, and Solve the Contradictory Fact of "All Roads Lead There, but There Is No Effect."</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen Said When He Was Dying That He Had Accumulated 40 Years of Experience and Deeply Knew That to Achieve China's Goal of Freedom and Equality, We Must Awaken the People and Fight Together. Now, Looking Back at Ourselves, How Much Work Have We Done in Awakening the People in the Past? This Is Something That Our Government and People Should Reflect on and Remedy in the Future. Special Announcement From This Journal: This Journal Plans to Publish a "Special Issue on the Lives of Female Workers and Female Shop Assistants" in the Next Issue. We Hope That All Writers From All Walks of Life Will Actively Contribute. Any Writings or Illustrations About Female Workers, Female Shop Assistants, Female Waitresses, Female Staff, Female Trainees, Etc. Are Welcome. Remuneration Is Generous.</p>

<h3>Such a World</h3>
<p>— Li Yinghui</p>
<p>Vegetable Vendor Life</p>
<p>Afu finished harvesting the turnips, packed them in baskets, and then looked up at the messy field, finding nothing left. He couldn't help but sigh, "It's over. The treasures cultivated with blood and sweat will all fall into the hands of others tomorrow." But he ultimately couldn't keep them because he needed to eat, needed money, so he had to sell them. What else was there to think about? Wasn't it a simple matter? So Afu stretched his neck under the carrying pole, and in one go, lifted the two baskets of vegetables, carrying them straight towards the house.</p>
<p>His wife had just finished cooking dinner, and the two of them sat face to face at a small square table, eating as usual.</p>
<p>"I don't know why, the less rice we have, the faster we seem to eat. There's only a little more than a bowl left in the bag," his wife said as she ate.</p>
<p>"Humph..." Afu grunted, saying nothing, but in his heart, he knew exactly what was happening. "I just hope we can sell them for a good price at the market tomorrow, and then everything will be fine."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Afu felt sad. Days passed like this, hardship wrapped in hardship. Year after year, he spent all his energy on the fields, exhausted to the extreme every day, but there was never a year or even a day that things got a little better, giving him a little joy. No, it was all hardship. Seeing the white, plump, and truly lovable turnips in the basket, without answering his wife's words, Afu said something else, "I was thinking, how about we keep five turnips?" He was waiting for his wife's agreement.</p>
<p>His wife really spoke up, saying, "We make a living by growing vegetables, but we fill our stomachs with rice. If we want to eat vegetables, won't we have no rice left?" These words were like a needle, deeply piercing Afu's heart, and he couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>After finishing dinner, it soon grew dark. Lighting the lamp, Afu wanted to wash the turnips, but his wife stopped him. She wanted him to go to bed early so he could get up early and go to Shanghai, and she would wash them and pack them into baskets. Afu had no reason to refuse, so he went to bed.</p>
<p>While washing the vegetables, Afu's wife stared at them in a daze. In her heart, she couldn't help but want to keep five for themselves, but five turnips could sell for a lot of money! What to do? Wouldn't selling more mean she could bring back more rice? She also thought, why do we grow vegetables every year, but we can't even eat our fill, and instead, we have to sell them to people who don't have to work hard to grow them? ... Looking at Afu's body sleeping on the bed, under the dim lamplight, she finally kept three. Three, yes, three also had the value of three, but she loved Afu and couldn't calculate the selling price of three anymore. She imagined Afu bringing back two loads of rice at noon tomorrow, sweating and walking into the house with a beaming smile. She was happy, quickly finished washing the vegetables, carefully packed them, then blew out the lamp, and lay down on the bed, holding Afu tightly as she fell asleep.</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>Before dawn, Afu's wife woke up first. She whispered, "Get up, Afu, it's almost dawn." She rarely called Afu's name, and when she did, it was always because she was particularly happy or excited.</p>
<p>Afu woke up, and they both got out of bed. She lit the lamp.</p>
<p>Without washing their faces or hands, Afu opened the door and went straight out with the carrying pole. As usual, his wife said as she closed the door, "Come back quickly after you sell the vegetables and buy rice!" This time, she added another sentence, "I'm waiting for the rice you bring back to cook!" After hearing these words and the sound of the door closing, Afu started walking on the dark road. He was completely familiar with this routine. Ever since he lived in this small village four miles away from Shanghai, he didn't know how many times he had gone to the early morning vegetable market.</p>
<p>On the road, as always, many people carrying vegetables were shouting "Hang yu," "Hang yu," heading to Shanghai together. Shanghai, at a low price, sucked away the vegetables they grew with blood and sweat, and exchanged them for expensive supplies and rice.</p>
<p>Although the earth was still dark and sleeping everywhere, it seemed to be awakened a little by their "Hang yu" cries. The darkness gradually thinned, and the silence of the night was occupied by the noise. After a while, a line of white light flashed in the eastern sky, and then a red, wheel-like sun emerged. Then, it was dawn. Inevitably, before dawn, some people carrying vegetables would arrive in Shanghai on time.</p>
<p>On the road, some strangers carrying vegetables would occasionally talk to each other, asking where you came from, if the road was easy to travel, or about the price levels, and saying that life was getting harder day by day. But what they talked about the most and most vigorously was hating the people in Shanghai who enjoyed happiness without working, as well as the stingy women who haggled endlessly when buying vegetables and the constables who were deliberately difficult. Once they arrived in Shanghai, they could no longer walk the same road. Each person went to their usual vegetable-selling place, scattering in different directions.</p>
<p>Afu, as usual, placed his carrying pole at the entrance of an alley next to the Pingliang Road vegetable market. The street was full of people buying vegetables, walking back and forth with baskets. Additionally, people pushing manure carts and workers after their shift mixed together, filling the morning street.</p>
<p>Afu hoped that customers would come quickly, that he could sell out quickly, so he could buy rice and go home quickly. Good, there were really customers, seemingly two maids. They picked six turnips and peeled off a layer of the outer skin of each, which made Afu's heart ache. They agreed on a price of 240 cash per catty, and eleven catties of turnips ended up selling for 1500 cash. The vegetables, with a layer of skin peeled off, were 14 copper coins short. Afu was a country bumpkin and got angry, arguing with them. Later, the two simply didn't buy them, and Afu was even more furious, angrily saying, "It's fine if you don't buy them, but you have to compensate me for the peeled skin!"</p>
<p>A country bumpkin was usually looked down upon by city people, especially those who worked as maids and servants in the city, who put on airs in front of country people. Therefore, in the end, there was no solution, and a large crowd gathered to watch the commotion. But the two maids remained calm, as if they didn't care at all. Afu, gesturing with his hands and feet, explained to the people, spitting as he spoke, but the situation remained the same.</p>
<p>Two constables arrived.</p>
<p>"Oh, Brother Zhang," one of the younger buyers greeted the taller constable, and then told the story according to her own interpretation, ultimately saying that Afu was a bad egg and had ulterior motives. This was a "God knows" situation! Afu quickly explained, but before he could say two words, the tall constable sternly asked him, "Do you have a license?" Of course, Afu didn't buy a license. If he had a license, he wouldn't have put the carrying pole at the entrance of the alley but would have set up in the vegetable market. He stammered, "No... have... Mr."</p>
<p>"Come with me!"</p>
<p>"She has to compensate..."</p>
<p>The tall constable slapped Afu in the face, and Afu felt dizzy, and his eyes seemed to see many sparks. The words he hadn't finished saying were beaten away. "Go, let's go to the office, no one will compensate you there!"</p>
<p>At this point, Afu understood. He thought it was better to give in. So he pleaded, "Mr., I don't want compensation anymore. My family is waiting for me to buy rice to cook at home. Mr., please make amends..."</p>
<p>"Go!" the tall constable interrupted Afu's words, "You don't want compensation, but I still want you to pay!"</p>
<p>Afu's heart jumped, as if he didn't know anything anymore. He just instinctively carried the carrying pole like a robot, following the tall constable blankly.</p>
<p>Problem Discussion: The Improvement of Child Labor Life</p>
<h3>A Type of Little Slave</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Regarding the general situation in China, Shanghai is the most developed place for machine industry. However, in the relatively secluded streets and alleys, especially in the Nanshi city area, we can still see workshops of lingering handicrafts at any time. Because these workshops are oppressed by machine industry, most of them are on the verge of bankruptcy. Even if there is a small part that can still be sustained, it only relies on apprentices who do not need to be paid wages as a pillar.</p>
<p>These workshops often have one or twenty apprentices, or at least three or five. Therefore, the number of these apprentices in Shanghai is very considerable. The source of these apprentices is mostly children from poor peasant families in the countryside, only twelve or thirteen years old. The workshop owners often treat them as slaves, making them cook, wash clothes, and take care of children, without giving them any remuneration, not even willing to give them a piece of clothing. Not only that, but sometimes they are not even given enough food to eat, scolding them or following it up with beatings. The pitiful situation of various abuses is far from comparable to the lives of trainees in general factories and stores.</p>
<p>Regarding the importance of the child labor problem, people in the West noticed it a hundred years ago. They believed that it was extremely inhumane to use young children for labor. Moreover, because children are overworked, their physical development must be incomplete, and their temperament will inevitably become very violent, resulting in either depravity or crime, and even burying their lifelong happiness, which has a bad impact on the country and society. Therefore, countries now have the promulgation of child labor protection laws, and there are extremely strict regulations on the age and working hours of child labor.</p>
<p>Because of all the backwardness in China, coupled with political and social unrest, many problems cannot be discussed. However, I feel that the protection of child labor is really urgent. The age of child labor, the duration of learning, and the treatment need to be improved. The government should have legal regulations and must strictly enforce them. Although this is not a thorough solution, it is better than nothing!</p>

<h3>Please, Proletarian Writers, Go to the People</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhuowu</p>
<p>A proletarian literary writer dressed very smartly felt a lack of writing material and specially went to the gate of a factory to wander, hoping to talk to the workers who came out of the factory after work, and perhaps get some proletarian experience and material that he had never experienced himself from their mouths. So he said to a worker with tattered clothes:</p>
<p>"Friend! Just got off work? Alas, you are so tired! It's a pity that the factory owner treats your flesh and blood body as if it were a lifeless machine!"</p>
<p>This worker not only did not accept his well-intentioned condolences, but shrugged and laughed sarcastically:</p>
<p>"Sir! What do you know? How can we workers compare to a machine? Not even as good as a screw. The machine is the property of the factory owner. If it is damaged due to excessive work, the factory owner will suffer a loss, so they must take good care of it. What do we workers count for? If our labor is squeezed dry, or if our body is damaged due to overwork, they just say "Get out, you motherfucker!" and we are kicked out of the factory. Sir! You compare us to machines, you are too flattering!"</p>
<p>This writer was embarrassed. Seeing that the conversation was not going well, he did not continue to talk, but walked on the road home. Suddenly, he met an old female servant in a mansion, carrying a kettle to make water... Thinking, "I can get some inspiration from her!" So he said very sincerely:</p>
<p>"Old woman! You are so old, and you still have to come out and do hard labor? Your master treats you like a dog, it's really pitiful!"</p>
<p>In the mind of this writer, he thought that comparing her to an animal would not make her blame him for being too flattering like that worker. But the result was beyond his expectations. The old female servant replied:</p>
<p>"Sir! Why do you compare me to a dog? If I could really become my master's beloved dog, Ahei, it would be the happiness I have cultivated for several lifetimes! It eats special dog biscuits and fresh beef every day, sleeps on warm bedding, and is loved by the master, living a comfortable life. How can I be as good as it? What can I compare it to!"</p>
<p>This writer was embarrassed again. He felt that this time he came out, the opportunity to collect material was not good, and he sadly went to a bar, ordered a cup of coffee, ate a few pastries, and went back to his own Western-style house.</p>

<h3>Why Is "A Start in Life" Not Allowed to Be Screened in the Concession?</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>It's strange that the Soviet film "A Start in Life" has been screened in twenty-seven countries, but it cannot be screened in the concession ruled by imperialism... It can be screened in the imperialist home country, but not in its ruled colonies or semi-colonies. Here, you can explore some reasons.</p>
<p>The proletariat in the imperialist home country certainly gives the imperialists some headaches. However, the clever imperialists desperately plunder some wealth from the colonies to slightly improve the lives of the proletariat in their home country. Thus, the imperialists believe that in this way, the proletariat in their home country can be softened and turn to the right, and "A Start in Life" can be screened. In fact, this is still the imperialists comforting themselves.</p>
<p>But what about the people in the colonies? Of course, life is even more miserable, and of course, social revolution is more likely to erupt. The imperialists know very well that this is very dangerous. Therefore, they use all their minds and try all kinds of methods, hoping that the people in the colonies will not be awakened, will always be confused, stupid, and will always be their slaves. Thus, many romantic, sexy, and sensual... films have emerged to anesthetize the working people in the colonies. However, Soviet Russian films are exactly the opposite of this. Therefore, the imperialists immediately put on a stern face and said: "Screening is not allowed here!"</p>
<p>Near the Arctic Circle, a strange country that can freeze people to death has suddenly risen. Everything in this country is in extreme opposition to the imperialist countries, and this country also likes to be close to weak nations. Of course, this is even more dangerous. Therefore, the imperialists have created many rumors that even they themselves have to laugh at to slander it, saying how bad it is, and even spitting on it, making the people in the colonies somewhat believe it. However, this film "A Start in Life" pointed out their foolishness, and the imperialists panicked and immediately waved their huge iron hands and said: "Screening is not allowed here!"</p>
<p>These are the reasons why "A Start in Life" is not allowed to be screened in the concession.</p>
<p>In fact, you stupid imperialists! The giant wheel of the times will never turn back. Your fate of destruction will eventually come. What's the use of banning a few Soviet films?</p>
<p>Business Economics</p>
<h3>Experiences in Running a Small Business</h3>
<p>— Jia Xiang</p>
<p>Last year, I ran a small shop in Jiang, selling cigarettes, paper, sundries, etc. The capital was a total of 500 yuan. After deducting the counter, shelves, and rent, the working capital was only about 400 yuan. The business was still thriving, but unfortunately, it closed during the Shanghai war.</p>
<p>In this unfortunate fate, I gained a lot of experience in running a small business. Now I will describe one or two for reference:</p>
<p>(1) How to decorate the facade: Counters, signs, and shelves should be decorated well, which can be used for advertising in small shops. It is best to use beautifully printed paper boxes, such as cigarette boxes, soap boxes, etc., stacked on the shelves, so that customers feel that "goods are piled up like mountains" when they enter the store, but in fact, the goods in the small shop are not many.</p>
<p>(2) Do not waste a penny: The most common mistake in running a small business is waste. Because there is money in the counter and goods all over the street, it is very easy to spend money. I don't know that spending one more yuan will reduce one yuan of capital, and also reduce the interest of a few cents. Carelessness in small matters can lead to a big disaster of closing the store. Therefore, those who open small shops should not spend even a wrong penny or an idle penny indiscriminately. If there is no change in the environment, the business will be good.</p>
<p>(3) How to sell and buy goods: Selling goods should be based on time, place, people, and adapt to circumstances. You should sell first and then buy, and do not keep too much stock. It is best to ask someone to introduce or go to a workshop or company to sign a contract, so that you can pick up the goods first and then pay (or pay half the price first, or one-third). Because borrowing other people's capital to run a business is the most convenient way. However, to prevent accidents, do not buy too much on credit.</p>

<h3>This Time</h3>
<p>— Kuangsheng</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers suppress the town, and shops are desolate together</p>
<p>A small shop closes, and Kuangsheng seeks a job</p>
<p>(Tonal pattern)</p>
<p>Once there was a roc that flew up, and it stirred up the clouds. It fell into the mud, leaving a vain trace. When spring comes, the ice melts and there is no trace.</p>
<p>It is said that Yao Kuangsheng, thirty-six years old, from Huizhou, has all five features and four limbs. Although he is not big-eyed and thick-browed, he is seven feet tall. He used to be the manager of a certain society on Er Ma Road. After two years of hard work, he has occupied a considerable position in the society. But, alas! The rear defense was sparse, and unfortunately, he did not know the warning of stepping on frost. The advance was fierce, resulting in the disaster of the ninth day of the year. There were also those Japanese soldiers who suppressed the town last year. In the sound of cannons, the prosperous Shanghai's six streets and three markets were shaken to pieces. Therefore, the three northeastern provinces lost their land, and my abbot's room also changed owners. Saying a cry, the descendants of other people heard it, and in the future, do not forget the atrocities of Japanese imperialism. Kuangsheng has already lost his job.</p>
<p>It is not easy to live in Shanghai. What is good? What is good? I have it. I will write a complaint-style article, publish an advertisement, and seek a suitable job. No matter how big or small, I am willing to take on the job. If there are domestic goods manufacturers who entrust publicity and promotion matters, that is even more like a cat encountering fishy smell, and nothing could be more to my taste.</p>
<p>It is true that the tonal pattern says writing always misleads the common people. If you want to know what will happen next, wait for a chance to explain. Correspondence address: Huazhang Xiexie Electric Carving Society, Er Ma Road, this city.</p>

<h3>Unexpected Resistance</h3>
<p>— Shao Zuoxuan</p>
<p>Editor: I am a shop assistant, and I dare not bother you if there is nothing wrong. Now, because I have a friend surnamed Zhao, he met a woman last year, and they love each other very much. They both hold the hope that "lovers will eventually become married," and they have the feeling of "I will not marry you, I will not marry you." But now they have encountered unexpected resistance. It turns out that the woman's family are all followers of "Muhammad," but Mr. Zhao is not. According to Islamic rules, their children are absolutely not allowed to marry outsiders, so her parents are absolutely opposed to this marriage.</p>
<p>Sir, you are a person who is good at answering difficult questions, so I specially wrote this letter on their behalf. May I ask why Muslims are not allowed to marry non-Muslims, and is there any legal provision? Here, I sincerely await your reply with 120,000 points. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Sincerely, Shao Zuoxuan</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>Editor's Note: I am not a believer in any religion, but I have had a considerable study of the doctrines of various religions. Although they each have their own far-fetched points, they all lead to the same goal, persuading people to do good. This point, of course, cannot be erased. Therefore, it seems that we should not oppose a person's conversion to a religion in order to strengthen their heart to do good. However, the rules of each religion contain some unreasonable provisions, which are really unbearable. The section that Shao Jun mentioned above is one of them. We think that a Muslim marrying a non-Muslim will not have any adverse effects in any way. Even when it comes to promoting doctrine, it is not impossible to take advantage of the power of assimilation. Now, it is unreasonable to impose restrictions.</p>
<p>Therefore, we want to persuade Mr. Zhao's girlfriend to marry Mr. Zhao with a spirit of great fearlessness. Fortunately, the law allows you to do this, and the rules of the church cannot impose sanctions. If you are unwilling to give up your religious beliefs for the sake of love, then it is also okay. Because their religious friends and church leaders can only drive you out of the mosque, but they have no power to prohibit you from reading the "Quran" at home. Moreover, your work actually does not violate the teachings of the church, but can abolish an unreasonable regulation in the church. Even "Muhammad" in heaven will smile and praise you as a church member worthy of inheriting his mantle. You only need to see that in the past, the Catholic Church also had regulations prohibiting marriage with outsiders, but what is it now.</p>

<h3>Latest News</h3>
<p>Our Army Enters Jinzhou</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in western Liaoning, our Northeast Volunteer Army once captured Jinzhou, but unfortunately, due to insufficient reinforcements, they had to withdraw again. However, that was a few days ago, so let's not dwell on it for now. Instead, let's talk about the fact that our publication recently received several manuscripts about the lives of female workers and female shop assistants. We plan to publish a special issue in the next edition, and we hope that our readers will provide as much guidance as possible. We welcome both text and illustrations, and we especially need information about female apprentices and female waitresses.</p>
<p>The Main Battle Has Begun</p>
<p>China has many "losses": the Northeast has lost territory, factories have suffered many fires, airplanes have had many accidents, poets have experienced many broken hearts, female movie stars have had many "missteps and regrets," the working people have lost their jobs and education, and those who strive in the anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist movement have often disappeared... Among these eight "losses," our publication is confident that it can pay considerable attention to the two tasks of "urging the government to quickly recover lost territory" and "relieving unemployment" without falling behind. Especially in this turbulent world situation, even if you want to ignore these things, it is impossible to do so.</p>
<p>Currently, in Rehe, the main battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies has already begun. In this critical moment of survival, naturally, we hope that our army can achieve the final victory and not withdraw entirely from China due to "strategic" considerations, concentrating in the Pamir Plateau to "build new positions." But at the same time, we, as incompetents, must organize ourselves tightly, strive for self-help, and unite with other weak nations and other oppressed people to fight together, so that the tide of this anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist movement continues to rise. We must break the past illusions of relying solely on those unreliable rulers, "high-class Chinese," and generals who only ask to volunteer but do not fight the Japanese. As for hoping that Japan will automatically raise its hands and return the Northeast to China, or hoping that the League of Nations, an imperialist spoils-sharing organization, will use large advertisements in Geneva newspapers to find owners for the lost territory of the Northeast, that is an impossible dream! All the incompetents of China! Don't think that "losing Jieting" is a small matter. You must know that if the entire nation perishes one day, there will be countless of your descendants who will learn from Liu Chen's "weeping at the ancestral temple" and not be able to find your graves, where "death has no place to rest"!</p>
<p>In short, at this serious juncture, our publication's mission is undoubtedly doubly important. Therefore, in order to awaken the people, we will especially welcome manuscripts about resisting Japan and saving the country from now on.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding "relieving unemployment," after our self-employment introduction column expanded its space in the local supplement of this newspaper, the number of submissions to the column has increased tenfold compared to before, but less than one in a hundred is interesting, which reduces reader interest and loses the effectiveness of the text. If this continues, it will not only be of no benefit to the unemployed themselves, but also the column is in danger of being canceled. We hope that all contributors will pay attention to this!

<h3>Hollywood's Gangster Terror</h3>
<p>— Qi Xia</p>
<p>The impression gained by the Russian novelist Boris Pilnyak after visiting the United States, he said… In the United States, respectable people in society openly associate with famous gangster leaders and are not ashamed of it. The government collects income tax from the leaders of evildoing, and politicians in various cities compete to serve them in order to secure their positions.</p>
<p>Someone said… America has two presidents, one in the White House and one in the "Black House." The former rules the United States of America during the day, while the latter rules the night.</p>
<p>The power of gangster leaders in the United States, known as the "Golden Country" of the world, is truly "red-hot." They have vast and tightly organized structures, deep-rooted power, and can gain the support of a segment of high society. Famous gangsters are worshipped by the majority of the people, and news reporters, the "uncrowned kings," even take pride in interviewing them, and writers even write biographies for them!</p>
<p>In the past, everyone only knew that New York and Chicago, which had the reputation of being "gangster cities," had traces of gangsters. The pink Hollywood was always the ideal paradise. Everyone could imagine that there were intoxicating wine aromas, fragrant powders, and mesmerizing flesh aromas. Modern young masters and modern ladies all wanted to go there.</p>
<p>According to reports from Los Angeles, Hollywood has recently become "Chicago" the second. Gangsters are very active, even exceeding the "reputation" of "Chicago." Everyone in Hollywood feels in danger, especially the famous male and female stars, who often have "uninvited guests" visiting their beautiful homes.</p>
<p>Recently, in Hollywood, a bandit posing as a telegram deliverer robbed the female star Beattie Compson of her jewelry, worth 50,000 US dollars. On the evening of the first of last month, two thieves sneaked into the seaside villa of Beringer and stole 1,000 dollars in cash. On the evening of the second, many bandits broke into the residence of Mr. Blisskin, the manager of Columbia Art Studio, and stole jewelry worth 42,000 US dollars. At the same time, Miss Galtorden, Brent, etc. were also robbed by bandits. In addition to deploying more police in Hollywood, the police authorities are also using all their strength to specially investigate these cases.</p>
<p>Hollywood, with its ruby lips and forests of powdered legs, is still so "glittering" and "dazzling," but it is no longer a "paradise" where one can "rest easy."</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Our Marriage History</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>The new film that opened yesterday at the New Light, originally titled "Me and My Gal," has been translated as "Our Marriage History." The topic is broad and the wording is colloquial. Doesn't it seem a bit inappropriate?</p>
<p>This film title indicates that it is a romantic comedy. As expected, it lived up to that name. However, because it focuses too much on slapstick, a script that originally had potential has been turned into something unreasonable. Your girlfriend's sister, although already married to a sailor, has an ex-lover who is an accomplished thief. He escapes from prison and forces her to design a plan for him to hide in her house. She is both afraid of his power and grateful for their old friendship, so she has no choice but to keep it a secret. However, her chronically ill father reveals the secret to a detective. So the detective comes to arrest him, and they engage in a gunfight. The thief dies, and the detective is slightly injured. However, he receives a large reward from the government and boards a ship with his newly married wife for a honeymoon.</p>
<p>The detective is played by Spencer Tracy, who is handsome and dashing, and has a humorous attitude even in serious moments. His facial expressions are also quite good. His girlfriend is Joan Bennett, whose artistry we are of course very familiar with. This time, she is not a naive girl, but a very loyal and worldly woman. The two scenes of training her sister are very exciting, and the portrayal of a woman and love is also vivid. The supporting actors are also very good. However, Marion Burns, who plays Jeon's sister, is not very good; she is only passable.</p>
<p>The director is very ordinary. Indeed, although Fox Company produces many excellent films, there are very few with particularly good directors. The lighting can only be said to be average, and the photography is okay, but there are only a few close-up shots that are quite impressive. The sets are very simple. In short, it does not have any special skills, so it is not easy to please.</p>
<p>Another point is that the dialogue is very interesting and the actions are also excellent. The interweaving accounts for almost half of the entire film and echoes everywhere, which can be called excellent. There is also a small section (a scene about the first kiss of love) that uses "parallel dialogue" to express the thoughts of the two people. It truly exposes the mask of men and women in love, and the contradiction between the mouth and the heart makes people laugh uncontrollably. This kind of shooting is rare and adds a lot of color.</p>
<p>Since the whole film has many humorous interjections, it has become a "complete comedy." However, the dialogue is mostly filled with jokes, and there are also many American slapstick actions. People who are not familiar with English and do not understand American customs are confused and have no choice but to watch others laugh.</p>
<p>The plot suffers from the interference of the interjections, and there are also many places that are not close to reality. Moreover, the laughter in many places is too exaggerated.</p>
<p>Overall, the entire film is on the average level and can be called an excellent performance. However, because the director avoided difficulties and used many implicit descriptions for no reason, the plot became very vague. The nonsensical slapstick interjections by the supporting actors actually overshadowed the brilliance of the main characters, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "The Three Lives Stone"</h3>
<p>— Jing Sheng</p>
<p>In Chinese rural society, which has not yet completely broken away from feudal traditions, mutual hostility between two villages, even armed conflict, is an inevitable phenomenon, and can even be said to be commonplace. "The Three Lives Stone" depicts just such a subject matter, but it is interspersed with a love story.</p>
<p>The story is like this... In a certain mining mountain, villages A and B have been feuding for years due to disputes over land and quarrying! However, the daughter of the village chief of village A is in love with the young master of village B, and they want to eliminate the feud and seek common survival and development. Who knew that the foreman, whom the village chief of village A trusts the most, covets the beauty of the village chief's daughter, so he leads a crowd to rob the property of village B, kill the village chief of village B, and even try to kill the young master of village B to eliminate future troubles. At that time, after the evil foreman intoxicated the village chief, he wanted to ravage his daughter. The village chief woke up, fought with him, and was killed. Fortunately, the young master of village B arrived in time and killed the evil foreman, causing the two villages to reconcile, leaving behind this Three Lives Stone.</p>
<p>"The Three Lives Stone" is indeed a relatively good subject matter, and the advantage of the screenwriter is that they did not write about the love story head-on, but the disadvantage lies in the ending... The accumulated hatred between the two villages can be resolved by killing an evil foreman and returning to good terms? The director showed great effort in this area. Apart from a few minor mistakes, it can generally be said to be successful. What about the actors? Apart from Chen Bin, who played the evil foreman, whose expressions were a bit excessive, the rest were good. In particular, Wang Chunyuan's self-portrayal of the young master of village B was even more active. Other aspects such as set design, photography, lighting, etc. can still be considered passable. In short, this is a relatively progressive and worthwhile play to watch among the productions of small companies!</p>
<p>A recent photo of Ms. Hu Die, who was elected queen in the recent Star Daily election</p>
<h3>A Statement of My Views on the Results of the Film Queen Election</h3>
<p>— Mu Zhu</p>
<p>The Film Queen election organized by the Star Daily has been announced. Ms. Hu Die was elected with 21,334 votes. Ms. Chen Yumei came in second with 13,028 votes. Ms. Ruan Lingyu came in third with 7,290 votes. I am greatly disappointed with the results of the election. I think that among a hundred movie fans, except for purely Westernized movie fans, at least ninety-nine should support Ruan Lingyu. Why? Since the release of the Lianhua's works, the films that Ms. Ruan has participated in, from "Wild Grass Blossoms" to the recent "Three Modern Women," she portrays a prostitute like a prostitute, and a rural woman like a rural woman. Her style is constantly changing; however, every move she makes vividly expresses the personality of the characters in the play. Beauty is certainly important; but art is more important than all other conditions. If you only judge people by their appearance, how could Marie Dressler have been elected Film Queen of Hollywood in 1931? Unfortunately, I only have one feeling... "Why are there so few comrades who appreciate art, and so many comrades who worship beauty?"</p>
<h3>Congratulations to Ms. Hu Die on Her Victory</h3>
<p>— Yang Saiqiu</p>
<p>The Film Queen election organized by the Star Daily has already been announced a few days ago. The audience's election of Ms. Hu Die as queen naturally means that Ms. Hu has a place that is worth being elected. The superiority of her art and the authenticity of her performance are the reasons for her being elected. Otherwise, why would Chen Yumei, Ruan Lingyu, Yang Naimei, etc. lag behind? In short, these are all the results of Ms. Hu's past struggles. Finally, I hope that Ms. Hu Die will not fail the audience's enthusiasm. (Thank you)</p>
<h3>A Visit to "Going to Shanghai?"</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The slapstick film "Going to Shanghai?" by the San Yi Company shot the last interior scene "Burning Book Tower" at the Shanghai Company that day. Filming began at midnight. The modern sets in the photography field were matched with extremely thick yellow smoke! In front of the camera, there was also a raging fire. Two dead-faced comedians, Wang Wuneng and Jiang Xiaoxiao, braved the smoke and fire to break into the room to save Qian Siying and Xue Lingxian.</p>
<p>Wang Wuneng and Jiang Xiaoxiao, they braved the fire to enter the room. The fire came out from the cracks in the door and burned Wang Wuneng's butt. He calmly shouted, "Fire burns my butt, but I must watch my step!" The second wave of fire came and burned Jiang Xiaoxiao's back of the head! He also shouted, "Fire burns the back of my head, I don't know what to care about..." The people who were visiting all laughed.</p>
<p>Finally, they had to carry Qian Siying and Xue Lingxian out.</p>
<p>Who knew that Xue Lingxian had gained weight after childbirth and now weighed more than 190 pounds! These two fools couldn't carry her. Jiang Xiaoxiao volunteered and tried his best to carry Xue Lingxian out.</p>
<h3>Sylvia Sidney Is Afraid of Being Photographed</h3>
<p>In Hollywood, no one would have thought that Sylvia Sidney would be so afraid of being photographed. When reporters surrounded her and asked to take pictures, she was really shy. Even though her shyness is hidden on the screen, outside the screen, her temper is so strange that it seems like she has become another person, which is almost unbelievable to herself. One day, when she was walking in the suburbs in the sunset, a reporter saw her beautiful back and wanted to secretly take a photo. He prepared his camera, but in order to make her turn her head and reveal her face, he suddenly shouted Sylvia Sidney's name. Of course, Sidney turned her head and saw a terrifying camera facing her. She quickly covered the lens and ran away. The reporter was happy, but with a moment's mistake, he let this great opportunity slip away, and kept lamenting his failure.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Rasputin (8)</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Yesterday she had been threatened by a special terror. Today she could laugh. But the terror of the time would permanently lurk beneath the pupils of her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>"Come, Paul!" She laughed. "You seem to be doing something very seriously! Now...nothing is wrong!" It seemed as if she had carefully identified its pleasantness. "The people will have a parliament. A new Russia will be born."</p>
<p>An usher was discovered at the door. He said, "Your Majesty, the photographer has arrived."</p>
<p>The Emperor raised his head weakly. He asked her, "Do I have to come too?"</p>
<p>"Of course!" She coquettishly pinched his ear. "This is a family photo for our whole family." She stood up, and the children gathered around her.</p>
<p>"Come on, my darlings," love filled her voice, and motherly love shone in her eyes! "Let's take a photo together. This is a memory of Russia, a memory of today, when you all go out into the world and rule other countries. And of your kind mother…" Her voice was broken, and soon, after a smile, she wiped away a little tear. "I'm becoming very sentimental, Paul. Help Nita Jia to the garden and wait for us. We'll be there in a while. Isn't that fun?"</p>
<p>After the photography, the Queen smiled at her husband.</p>
<p>"Are you really a little lamb… a henpecked little lamb?"</p>
<p>Her husband pretended to sigh. In his heart, he was happy and satisfied. He ruffled her smooth hair, and she laughed happily. The Emperor looked at her, smiling like a rose and like a female student, and his heart was pounding. They ran happily into the garden. The little prince flew to the door and waited to open it. Nita Jia and Paul were already there, and they were hugging each other. The children laughed happily when they saw their intimacy.</p>
<p>"Paul, ah, Paul!" Anastasia giggled. "We thought you came to visit us! Be quiet, Nita Jia!"</p>
<p>The Queen and Emperor watched with delight. The Queen said with a smile…</p>
<p>"　　　　　　They!" After a while, she said… "Children, go and play by yourselves. Let the adults play adult games."</p>
