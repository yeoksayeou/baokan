<p>報載本埠葉鴻英先生將一生辛苦積累所得。除别有規定外。悉數捐充興辦敎育之用。並指定專辦圖書館及鄉村敎育。捐數計達百萬。在舉世滔滔惟個人福利是圖之今日。葉先生乃能如此大澈大悟。舉社會之財。還諸社會。是誠爲一不可多見之盛舉。允足博取世人深重之敬意。</p>
<p>彼淺見者流·各惟私有是鶩·取諸社會者·即積聚而不散。終身役役。除自身享受而外。復爲子孫謀。欲使其子孫百世。皆克享此而無凍餒之憂。吾人即不言此種舉動爲絶對的愚笨個人主義之行爲。而就一般之情形言。巨量之遺産。亦適足以養成子孫之惰性。使其依賴先人之餘蔭。不求自力。徒知享受。紈袴子弟。無不爲巨富之後裔。奢靡淫逸。罔知艱難。安坐而食。百無一能。迨其最後。則又無不家業蕩盡。貧困無以自存。故以財富貽子孫者。其結果適所以戕殺其子孫·無異於束縛其子孫之手足。使其不能勞動。不能自食其力。不爲一有益社會之﹁人﹂。而爲一徒知消費之蠧。則何如以社會之財。用諸社會。不徒爲個人打算。亦不徒爲一家打算。自身不爲財所役。亦不使子孫役於財而爲財所累。能積能散。使社會都蒙其休。此種舉動。在行爲上旣至善。在心理上尤至樂。助人自助。福人自福。其所計之遠。所見之深。固絶非一般﹁守財奴﹂所可想像。所能理解。此吾人之所以對此次葉先生捐其私産。俾作公用之善舉。誠心表示敬意也。</p>
<p>雖然。葉先生所指辦之圖書館及鄉村敎育。其辦理方針若何。吾人今兹尚</p>
<p>無從得知。則對於此事之經辦人。吾人亦有欲爲進一言者。就我國今日之情形言。圖書館之辦理。應力求其大衆化。普遍化。俾大衆都克蒙受裨益。而絶不應徒供少數人之欣賞。或一二專家之研究。今日社會旣日即於貧困。敎育亦適爲商品化。大多數之下層民衆。皆無讀書機會。而其求知之慾望。則又綦切。即以本報最近創辦之流通圖書館之經騐爲例。本報之所以創辦此流通圖書館。原冀以最便利之手續。予一般市民以業餘讀書之機會。凡欲借書者。祇須繳納一元或二元之保證。金手續可謂簡便已極。但仍有讀者中途要求退回保證金。爲一時家中買米之用。因而不得不暫時犧牲其讀書機會。﹁生存﹂﹁求知﹂。時相牴觸。此種至可悲痛之事實。即可推知社會大衆之一般狀况。故今日葉先生旣已捐輸巨額基金。急當用以救濟大衆之知識恐慌。使大衆都得因葉先生之捐輸。而得一求知之機會。此吾人所期望之圖書館也。其次。鄉村敎育。亦至爲重要。吾人前已言之。今日之敎育。率已商品化。知識必以金錢換來。而知識乃常爲少數人所獨占。至於農村貧苦之子弟。則終身在無知無識之狀態中長成。此一代如此。下一代仍如此。金築之校門。貧苦者惟有望洋而興嘆。故今日我人而言掃除文盲。而言提高社會文化。則厲行鄉村敎育。實爲至急之要圖。不過鄉村敎育之舉辦。應當重在切實。重在以最低限度之經費。收穫最大之效果。而不應舗張揚厲。侈言主義。糜費旣多。實效則鮮。此又吾人所期望之鄉村敎育也。</p>
<p>綜言之。葉先生旣已捐此巨欵。此後之問題。即爲如何使此欵用得其當。如何使社會蒙受其利。吾人尤盼國内豪富。聞風興起。追踵葉先生之後。繼此義舉。﹁人之好善誰不如我。﹂吾人謹當拭目以俟之。</p>

<p>武力抵抗經濟絶交爲禦侮要策</p>
<p>團結民心須剷除官僚軍閥政治</p>
<p>京訊、中央華北辦事處主任委員張繼、前晨（三日）八時、由新鄉回京、日日社記者昨訪張氏於寓邸、叩以華北近况與救國之根本方針各項、當荷接見、並作詳盡之谈話、兹將最重要之各點、分誌如次、張氏謂宼華日軍、現正從熱河西部向察哈爾東境進犯、意在得步進步、侵吞内蒙古之察哈爾綏遠諸要區、將我長城以外之地、盡歸其掌握、然後南窺平津、入宼關内、其計固狡、用意亦毒、我方在察哈爾東、雖已嚴加防備、但前途如何、胥視前線軍人與全國上下一致抵抗之决心如何爲斷、沿長城各口、日來本人得消息、未有大戰、即有接觸、亦係日軍牽制我後方、目前之企圖、固以察綏爲最大之目的也、</p>
<p>華北辦事處之遷移與否、此時尚未能具體决定、本人之意、設此辦事處之初意、自有根本上之重要使命、但如何能盡此使命、以發生效力、當在職務上之有否執行力量爲前提、如能克盡任務、遇事不致生任何困難、則此辦事處非特由新鄉遷至保定、即遷至前線亦無不可、若遷而後、仍未能解决一切困難以發生效力、則遷移亦徒然耳、照例國難嚴重至此、軍人尤其華北軍人、應一致上前線去殺敵衛國、然假如有軍人不願上前線者如何、再如人民組織起來、用自衛力量抗敵、亦爲當前之亟、但若有當地軍人、深恐人民有自衛組織以反動、而不許其自衛、又將如何、更如抵制仇貨、爲經濟上制敵方法之一、但若軍軍閥官僚、包蔽仇貨、壓迫人民抵貨運動、更將如何、此均值得注意之問題、</p>
<p>救國禦侮之道、照目前言、有兩者最爲必要而效、（一）武力抵抗、（二）經濟絶交、如武力與經濟兩事並進、必能收相當效力、此可斷言、因敵人之侵略我國、亦用武力與經濟兩事並進、日本强佔東三省及熱河、用大砲機關槍殺害我人民、武力侵略也、仇貨用傾銷政策大批運華、使國貨無發展之餘地、經濟侵略也、爲對症發藥計、論救國禦侮、祇有武力抵抗興經濟絶交兩事、然此事之實行、一則須軍人與民衆聯合起來、與敵人拚命、一則須政治與民衆溝通一氣、抵制他貨、爲謀一往前進不發生困難、先須剷除官僚軍閥政治、否則官僚貪汚、利用職權、以阻止抵貨、軍閥養兵自衛、不上前線抗敵、反阻止人民自衛、均足影響於救國禦侮、此事本人即將向中央陳述、在中央亦所以急待討論者、反之、不從根本之圖、而空言救國、又何能收之十四縣、共有人民三百萬以上、其中有壯丁五十四萬人、可見全國可以執槍衛國壯年人、不在少數、特未團結起來耳、</p>
<p>開放政權、在本人之意、總須將政權能行施全國上下、通行無阻爲目的、我國現時、非無政權、特政權不能上下通行、爲一大病、因將政權交與能行使之人以達到救國目的、則開放自無不可、若有其名無補實際、則開放等於不開放耳、憶自一九一四年歐洲大戰時、本人遊法遊德、法國五千萬人中、死傷二百萬以上、國人尚繼續赴疆場出戰、德國七千萬人中、死傷三百萬左右、國人亦繼續上戰塲拚命、我國國難雖重、死傷者若干、由此可知國人對於國難觀念爲何如、憶一九二零年在德國柏林、居於旅邸、飲食須先向官廳領取飯票、始能購得食物、糧食集中者如此、再萊茵河上、已爲各國軍隊把守、而德國之小孩、仍用小船往來河中、高唱國歌、有外國兵酒醉行於馬路撞及德人、被德人掌摑而倒、馬路中間盡是外兵、德人數名挽手並行於馬路中、高唱德國歌、外兵無之如何、德國人之愛國程度、與我國相比較、又爲何如、總之我國革命尚未成功、衆同志須一致努力前進、共同救國、﹂云云、（日日社）</p>

<p>丨本埠康腦脫路自由農塲尤懷臯先生</p>
<p>來信答復本欄雄聲君丨</p>
<p>到鄉村去的先决條件：（一）你是否愛好響村？（二）你是否眞心愛你的鄕村中的農友？（三）你自問能否堅决任勞在鄉村中尋生活？鄉村中的好處，（一）是接近天然，未有城中的汚濁：（二）人民誠實，未有城中的欺詐，（三）生活自由，未有城中的干涉。鄉中苦處，（一）缺少供養，不能得到物質上享用，（二）久居城中的人，或要感到枯寂無聊的少趣，但是我覺得在國難臨頭時節，眼見都市中醉生夢死的生活，倒不如覓一幽靜可愛的鄉村去另謀出路，憑我能力可及，用十年的工夫，來建設一個意想中的新式桃花源。城市中缺的是食品及物料，這是鄉村中能供給的。照我國目下的情狀看來，識幾個字的農民，眞是鳳毛麟角，所以鄉村中缺的是人才，照雄聲君人才，在城市的是一個無地可容的失業者，在鄉村中却是一個鶴立鷄羣的一個領袖人物，何來﹁犯法没有胆，自殺末勇氣﹂的話麽？我是絶對主張鄉村敎育救國的一個人，上海租界的地面狠有限，决不能容留整千整萬的各國回來的留學生及大學中學的畢業生，丨知識階级，唯一出路，就是擔任敎育鄉村與興復鄉村，鄉村的生活，一家三口，大約要有農田四畝，在近城方面，至少也要二畝，但是要親自耕種，妻子協作，始可成功。照雄聲君不能犁耕只能筆耕的人，無怪他要望洋興嘆，毫無辦法。但是我有方法替雄聲君來設計：第一步施敎：在親友中籌措一二百元（至少百元，）在這春光和暖時、最好回到你的本鄉去。因爲方言是極關重要，尋一比較生産豐富生計優越人口略多的鄉村，在這鄉村中居住，與盤桓數日，考查學齡兒童人數，若向鄉人租二間小屋，大約每年租金至多不過十元，一間作課堂，一間作招待室及臥室，三餐可貼膳於鄰居，如是可省却無數的麻煩與有用的時光，來研究攻讀，定一份日報，暇來與村民講解。（等到日後有力量時，可購一收音機、（吾預料將來政府一定要用廣播方法來教導農民，因爲這是一種普及敎育的利器。）雄聲君的衣服，春夏秋可穿布貨的中山裝，冬日可穿布袍，照此計劃，雄聲君的衣食住及日常生活，以及課堂等問題，均能以極經濟的方法來解决，敎育經費百分之七十是敎員薪水，若在鄕村，雜費更是便宜。至於雄聲君的生活，可於下法出之（一）略收學費，一節一元，酌量定之，不可勉强；（二）最好命每一學生每年於年底納一雞或一鴨，或三十個雞蛋於學校，此雞可稱爲﹁讀書雞，﹂在農家不覺什麽困難，在學校却是一種收入。我主張第一年要抱一種犧牲心，總要在村中廣播好感，使農民信任，三四年後，學生長大成人，就是你的信徒。第二步是帮助農民組織合作社。若能小有成效，若上海銀行及農民銀行，都可以放欵，這是一種極重要的事務，若能於此事辦成，你的基礎就十分的鞏固。第三步是行醫賣藥。鄉間最盛行疾病，是秋後之瘏與赤眼。這是有特效的良藥可以醫治，若金雞納霜等，但只可擇確有特效的良藥出售，切不可貪得無厭，害人生命，這又是一種收入。第四步等到以上三事辦成以後，你的地位一天的一天的增高，學生亦一天的增多，你就是一村中的領袖，那末可以進行村治的工作。但是同時可以與各種學術機關省建設機關農業學校等等通信設法解决疑難的問題。同時又可與附近的農村或城鎭聯絡，若覺一人不足，可以約知己者一人，同工辦理。記者按：尤懷皇先生向熱心主張鄕村敎育救國論·對於鄕村敎育，很有研究而且是一位實行家。兹接來函，對於昨日本欄雄聲君所問﹁農村裏回得去嗎？﹂一函，有所解答，盛意至可感佩！除將原函照刊外·讀者有何意見·並請惠書共同討論。</p>

<p>猶太人不光在中國出了哈同，在歐洲，更不知有多少比哈同更有錢的猶太人，控制着歐洲的經濟。在美洲，更有一位頭兒腦兒，尖兒頂兒的煤油大王洛基弗洛閣下，也是一脈相傳的猶太人。</p>
<p>猶太人不光佔據了世界上經濟界的重要地位，就是學術，也與科學家以不少貢獻。專談相對論的愛因斯坦老先生，便是久仰盛名，如雷貫耳的猶太人之一。</p>
<p>猶太人，說起了，來頭大，還有一位四海揚名，千秋萬古，竊人看見哈哈笑，富人看見雙脚跳的馬克斯同志。這老大哥，把歷史的核心，從﹁政治﹂中血淋淋地刳出，裝進﹁經濟﹂的腔子裏，而引起了今日靑年的不穏思想，各地的恐怖情形。</p>
<p>猶太的亡國，是亡定的了，却倒出了這麽一大批大人大馬，可知亡國是不成問題的。耶穌之後，出了這多名人。俺孔孟之後，一旦亡了國，過上一千年合八百載，準也會出上幾位驚天地而泣鬼神的好漢。</p>
<p>德籍猶太人被德國人虐待，排斥，散居各國而已亡國的猶太人，便聯合着對德抵制。俺未亡國的華籍中國人，被僑居國政府虐待，排斥，别處的華僑，兀是多吃飯，少開口。據說，惟有亡國奴，繼要團結。俺亡國得久了，準也會學猶太人那一套。</p>

<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>交通大學的工業及鐵道展覽會，在上星期已經開幕了，離開母校已快兩年的我，得着這個盛大紀念機會，不必說，自然興高采烈地去參加。</p>
<p>兩年一别，母校似乎什麽都異樣了，我們依着箭頭的指示而前進，第一看到的是路市展覽，裏面有各省市政道路的建設報告，尤其是漢口的市政設計模型最爲精緻。體育館裏是學生成績展覽，工業展覽在工業館，分上下二層，陳列物品多至數千種，各種機器和電氣用具，並且可以實地試騐，自動電話可以當塲通話，大北電報機可以代客收發，一端寫好了字句，另一端電報立刻便收到了。</p>
<p>大件機器，陳列在草棚裏，有些正在開動，比較新奇的，有海軍部的大飛機江鳳號。上院是鐵道展覽，各鐵路局都有物件陳列，尤其是京滬滬杭甬鐵路的模型，玲瓏可愛，最爲别致，自南京至寗波，路軌蜿蜓，也有站台，也有號誌，出米的區域放一小袋米，出煤的地方放一堆煤，沿線電線木桿上懸着通明的電燈，火車不時地開行着。</p>
<p>環校一周，另由禪臣洋行舗設小火車路，周圍約一里，用柴油引擎拖帶客車四五輛，隨時開行，好奇的仕女們爭先恐後的以一乘爲快。在此次工鐵展覧會中，還有一件事值得一記的，便是容閎堂的落成，自從黎矅生長校以後，交大氣象，頓成篷勃，執信西齋，福開森體育場，工業館以外，容閎堂總辦公廳各在極短時期以内完工，於此，我們不得不佩服建設力量的偉大，而向勞苦功高的黎校長表示十二分的敬意。</p>

<p>春意漸漸地濃厚了。爲了不肯辜負，和華打算往龍華去探問一下桃花的消息。我們租了兩輛脚踏車，興致勃勃地向龍華進行。</p>
<p>漸漸地進了鄉村的懷抱，田野一片緑色，路旁的楊柳，都放出黄緑的嫰芽，華高興極了，高唱着快樂的春天。</p>
<p>龍華的塔看見了，多末高，多末雄壯。鄉村的環境是夠人羡慕的，華說：﹁我將來一定要住在農村裏。﹂</p>
<p>不滿意的就是桃花還没開放。不過我們已感到春意的確濃厚了。</p>

<p>游方僧一手豎在胸前，一手不住的打着那懸掛在身前的大木魚；嘴唇翕動着，走一程，便向着那泥爛的馬路虔誠的跪下來！虔誠的叩着頭·</p>

<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>（西瓜）我們在侵晨，太陽没有出來的時候，不用刀剪等物（忌銅鐵）採切，而用石塊搗斷其蒂莖。這瓜受了甘露，未經太陽光的緣故，他的甘味水分，非常充分，有澄淸血液的功效。年老的人食之，可以治腎臟病，中風病，黄疸病，脚氣病，以及尿道膀胱心臟發生障礙等病。普通飯前飯後吃稍許，各種疾病，就能漸漸減輕，若是患感冒有高熱的時候，稍食西瓜，可以預防腎臟炎。現今西藥中用西瓜糖，製成治腎臟病藥，用西瓜羹，製成治急性腸加答爾痢疾等病。炎天出門歸時，食之可滅疲乏。没有勞動以前，或想登山的時候，吃幾塊西瓜，可以增加氣力。喜歡肉食的人，可以中和肉的剌激。但是過下午四點鐘多食西瓜，腹部受冷，免不了發生障礙。所以年幼的小兄弟小妹妹，千萬要注意的。倘若爲臭蟲咬傷，用西瓜汁擦之，可以治療傷痕。余家有一痢疾奇方，今特公開，以餉閱者：用很熟肥大的西瓜，挖去其子，連皮切碎，放在布袋内絞汁，盛在瓦鍋中，用文火煮之。等到燒乾一半時，加冰糖四兩，這時不停的拌攪約五分鐘，卽封入瓶中，凡患痢疾者，每天空腹飲一匙，包可治愈。</p>
<p>（梨）大凡病人，身有高熱，食欲不進的時候，嚼梨吞汁，有解熱奇效。現今西藥中的淸凉劑，用梨汁製者很多。年老的人，若剥皮切塊，加鹽少許煮食，有舒筋活絡之功。若去心加冰糖蒸熟，用布絞汁，能止咳嗽。</p>
<p>（無花果）爲治痔的良藥，食其實，並用葉煎湯，功效尤大。倘若每晨食之，旣可潤腸通便，且能治痢疾。冬季如採無花果一斤先用鹽水洗凈，不使帶有水氣，去皮加冰糖四兩，淸水一杯，煮二十分鐘，成爲糖漿，患痔疾者，每早括在麵包上吃，或用醋半匙無花果漿一匙，用開水冲湯，服之亦可。</p>
<p>（葡萄）葡萄在果物中其滋養料最豐富。外國以食葡萄爲治腦病與神經衰弱的特效藥。但是這種果做藥用的不可去子，而且多食葡萄，也無妨碍。我們若取紅黑小粒的葡萄，煮熟，（不加水）把葡萄汁貯藏在瓶中，在冬季患傷風感冒的時候，用開水加白糖少許冲服，功效奇大。每平常每夜稍飲葡萄汁，可以預防感冒。</p>
<p>（桃）桃子當藥物用時，很有收歛性，但是未熟的與己經腐敗的，則不可食，食之反使胃腸，發生障碍。從前有一句土話：在黑暗的地方吃桃子，很有好處。總之，大凡患皮膚創傷或潰爛等病，多吃桃子，效力很大。</p>
<p>以上五種水果，我們應當明瞭其對於人身有什麽功效，不過無論那一種東西，切不可濫吃，要有相當的時候與分量斟酌食之才好。</p>
<p>更正　上海夜話﹁吃烟店﹂一稿中，有不少排錯的字，更正如下：（一）﹁法文爲Tobaco﹂應改﹁法文爲Tabac﹂（二）﹁西班牙語爲Tabago﹂應改﹁西班牙語爲Tobaco﹂。（三）﹁英國海島之一的T</p>

<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>國難一到，通電的通電，請纓的請纓，坐鎭的坐鎭的坐鎭，募捐的募捐，似乎上下一心，都在﹁共赴國難一。然而，一壯士軍前半死生，美人帳下猶歌舞﹂，有的在前線﹁肉搏﹂，有的却在後方笑嘻嘻的搂着女人跳舞。前天被兩個朋友拉到Ambarsador去了一趟，在這﹁國難期間﹂，忙着跳舞的人居然會有那麽多，眞使我吃了一驚。這并非說國難來了。就必須人人哭喪着臉。法律上截至現在，旣無明文規定，而我雖然﹁愛國不敢後人﹂，但對於那些﹁救國不忘娱樂，娱樂不忘救國﹂的人，也並無深惡痛絶之意。不過一想到有些人在浴血苦戰，而其餘的人卽使也掏點腰包，從事﹁航空救國，﹂或﹁跳舞救國﹂之類，却是依然沉醉在狂歡縱慾中，行所無事，至少也不能不使人發生人類間的不平之感··</p>
<p>但我現在要說的并不在這裏。</p>
<p>﹁如入鮑魚之肆久而不聞其臭，﹂老在人肉市塲裏翻筋斗的朋友，是不會感覺這市塲的醜惡的，但在初次進這外國文明舞塲的人，却不免要想到這社會果眞是建築在甚麽上面。這兒一切都成了商品：女人的肉身是商品，女人的微笑也是商品。辛克萊說屠塲中除開猪　的呌聲以外，甚麽都有用，我敢說，在這跳舞塲裏，連人類的呼吸也都是商品。（自然是女人的！）但這情形也並不止跳舞塲如此，我記得有一次到一家大旅館去會朋友，坐了兩個鐘頭，看見一個女孩子進來三趟，每趟丢下一張女十﹁談相﹂的傳單，每張傳單上的文字除開乂乂女士的名字不同，中間印着的照片各異，證明這是三個不同的女士以外，其餘是一字不易。上面一律申明：﹁除談相外，謝絶一切應酬﹂，﹁敬却非分之賜﹂，﹁保重人格名譽，爲乂乂不二的宗旨﹂，﹁諸君如不談相，望勿相邀﹂。······談相倘使是正當職業，何必申明？倘使要申明，就見得這職業至少是被人利用過，而今拆穿了。那位朋友說，這聲明正是告訴你以可以問津的意思。可見這裏又有一種待價而沽的商品了。</p>
<p>又有人從歐洲回來，道經西貢，看見那裏的大烟館都張貼着﹁新到女招待﹂的告白。那麽女人之成爲商品，已經無遠勿屆，萬方一致了。</p>
<p>現在中國是甚麽都被人利用救國了，借重上述種種商品去救國的事，想來也是不能免的了。</p>

<p>他當着敎室裏的那些大受驚慌的學童，用一種憤怒的强硬態度，把這個愛字向他們的老師劈面大嚷，所以這一位祗得倒退幾步，臉色比從前更現灰白，眼睛也睜得滾圓。於是學童們都站起來了，發生了擾亂了。他感到自己已經失敗就吞吞吐吐地說：</p>
<p>丨丨您是一個光棍。</p>
<p>他剛好含糊地說出最後這幾個字，那堂副就撲到他身邊，並且抓住他的雙臂，而堂長就舉手預備來打。</p>
<p>但是堂副没有把他的雙臂抓得緊，因爲當時竟發生了兩嚮的槍聲。堂長倒在地下了，像是一堆東西似地並不動彈，堂副在倒下之後却還掙扎不住。</p>

<p>出版約在一千九百二十七八年，内容共列記事文二十五篇，分三卷：（一）歐戰，（二）白的恐怖，（三）其他，本篇即三之首篇，所記爲西班牙未改民國政體以前的實事；至於譯文，則側重意譯也。譯者附識</p>

<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>我們看着映在湖水裏的靑天。</p>
<p>湖水是那麽澄淸，又是那麽柔軟，給微風輕輕的吹皺着好像一個個嬌艶的笑渦。把一片蔚藍的天也揉得滿是皺紋了。我看看旁邊的倩，正望着湖水出神，就說：﹁倩，這許多淺淺的笑渦，比起電影明星密司胡臉上的怎麽啦？﹂倩最愛人家臉上的笑渦。</p>
<p>﹁你弄錯了吧，倩又不是想着密司胡的笑渦，她是惦記那陸先生，你看，這一閔閔的微波，正像陸先生那雙發亮的眼睛呢。﹂</p>
<p>給萍這麽一說，我倒笑起來了。我就想起上半天那位陸先生到我們寓處來看倩的事。倩並不說什麽話來否認，只裝了一個嬌嗔的笑，就跟另外一隻船上的朋友講話了。我們這一夥兒八個人，分坐了兩隻船，我們是並行着的。</p>
<p>模糊的遠山，半抱着西湖，一些建築在湖水裏倒映着許多黑的影子，在那兒蠕動着，我看了就有一種古怪的憧憬。船又慢慢地拐了一個灣，剛經過的地方，便劃成一條黄金色的水帶。許多遊艇，都拖了這麽一根黄金色的帶，有的慢慢地遠去，有的又在輕蕩着過來。船上的人們每個臉上印着輕快的笑，一雙雙眼睛都像夢遊病者似的有一種迷惘的神情。更有許多年靑的男女，兩個兩個的坐着一條船，輕風把他們的笑語丢在空間，給湖面的微波吞去了。</p>
<p>﹁我們順便再到湖濱公園去玩一下子。﹂那條船上有人提議。</p>
<p>可是我們都反對，都不說話，只有倩高興地說：﹁我最歡喜這樣坐在船上，什麽東西都可以看得見，只要有月，今天晚上就坐一夜我也高興的。﹂</p>
<p>﹁算了吧，晚上陸先生要來看你啦，你跟他去玩吧。﹂</p>
<p>大家都笑了。這一夥兒總歡喜那麽說笑話的。太陽掛到了遠遠的山采腰裏，湖水更好像鍍上了黄金那樣地發亮。零零落落的遊艇都向燈光輝耀的那邊蕩去。一面是幽美的靑山，一面是近代都市味的市塲。秀麗的西子，穿上摩登的服裝了。我的同伴們唱起流行的歌曲來，只有我一個人是聽着，看那映照在水裏的燈光，作着我憧憬的幻夢。</p>

<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（十三）夷齊論</p>
<p>予初握管爲文，即好爲深刻翻騰之論。蓋幼時讀四子書畢，偷讀金聖歎評點三國志演義一書，塾師又命閱讀東萊博議，了凡綱鑑。予於了凡綱鑑，最喜胡致堂之評論。此公道氣甚深，衛道尤切，凡歷史人物不在堯舜禹湯文武周公孔子聖聖相傳之道統者，深文周内，一律駡倒。予於三國志演義，嗜讀回目前之金聖歎評語，以爲深刻奇警，幾於段段成誦。至於東萊博議，則不過心善其翻案而已。予受金聖歎胡致堂呂東萊之影響至深，初固不自知也。塾師某先生授讀史記，至伯夷列傳，乃以夷齊論命題。予文略謂孤竹君幸有中子，不然，夷齊讓國百逃，大位虚懸，不將亡國絶祀矣乎？是爲不孝。若明知有人可立，而以讓國爲高，巧言欺世，是不仁。不仁不孝，而人以聖智稱之，不亦誣乎？某先生於文尾評曰：</p>
<p>小人之好議論，有如是哉？以二子之所成就如此卓卓，猶不得免，其他則又何說！</p>
<p>此用韓退之張中丞傳後序語，蓋韓公爲張巡許遠辯誣者也。予讀此評語，旣服某先生之聰明，顧復恨其刻毒。其時某先生方以淸高聖潔之隠者自命，菲薄夷齊，適中所忌。未幾；而某先生降自首陽，大隠在朝矣。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>﹁你的夫人呢？﹂</p>
<p>海泉坐下來後便問他。</p>
<p>﹁小孩子有點不好。她出去買藥去了。························眞豈有此理！走了三四個鐘頭，還不見回來！﹂</p>
<p>最後一句，大概是駡他的夫人了。</p>
<p>﹁你的夫人幾時出去的？﹂</p>
<p>﹁一早出去的。﹂</p>
<p>﹁幾點鐘的時候？﹂</p>
<p>﹁我們没有時鐘，要看下面房主人的才知道。但是下面的也不很準。大概是七八點鐘的時候出去的吧。﹂</p>
<p>海泉聽見後便想，作算是八點鐘出去的，也有二三個鐘頭了。到底買些什麽東西，要花這樣多的時間。</p>
<p>﹁老林你出去替我買兩三塊燒餅給我好麽？要鹹的。﹂</p>
<p>世光此刻臉上浮起了一點苦笑。</p>
<p>﹁你還没有吃早飯的？﹂</p>
<p>﹁誰燒給我吃呀！她一早爬起床來就出去了。小孩子又死要人抱着。一放了下來，便哭得厲害。······哎！這種生活我眞不願意過了！﹂</p>
<p>世光說了後又吁了一口大氣。懷中的小孩兒便應着他的嘆聲哇地一嚮哭起來了。</p>
<p>﹁啊！啊！······啊！······﹂</p>
<p>世光捧起小孩向左右擺動。那種樣子看見眞會令人發笑，而他的喉頭像給什麽東西　住了的。﹁啊，啊！······﹂的聲音也唱得非常難聽，不像他的夫人唱得那樣淸脆好聽。</p>
<p>﹁好的。我替你買燒餅去。三塊够了？不要油條？﹂</p>
<p>﹁多買兩條油條也好，我抽屜裏有銅板，你拿出。﹂</p>
<p>﹁不。我這裏有。﹂</p>
<p>海泉說着飛奔向樓下來了。但他剛踏出後門，就看見曹世光夫人抱着一個小菜籃子從弄堂口走進來。</p>
<p>﹁啊呀，林先生，幾時來的？怎麽不多坐一刻？就要走麽？﹂</p>
<p>她看見了海泉，像有說不出來的喜悅，她儘是一面說一面笑。海泉看見她也比昨天好看了一點。大槪是因爲外出，化了裝的緣故吧。</p>
<p>﹁不。我是替老曹買燒餅出來的。﹂</p>
<p>﹁啊呀！那對不起林先生了。林先生不要買了。我已經買了包子回來了。······﹂</p>
<p>﹁眞的？﹂</p>
<p>望着秋英那樣妖嬈的樣子，海泉無意識地間了她﹁眞的﹂兩個字。</p>
<p>﹁這有什麽好扯謊的呢！﹂</p>
<p>﹁對不住。﹂</p>
<p>他笑着折回身向弄堂裏走了。她便走近來緊挨着他的肩頭下一路走。海泉着了一陣奇怪的﹂</p>
<p>的香氣，好像是她頭髮上搽的香油。</p>

<p>（日聯社特别稿）日本政府現已退出國聯、然其未决意之前、日外務省曾研究退出國聯後應發生之種種問題、對於各方面之影響及盟約第十六條之制裁行爲、能否實現等重要問題、以供决定日本退出國聯之根本原則、經此調查之結果、遂得結論、第十六條之制裁行爲、絶不能實現、於是日本政府遂下最後决心、於三月二十七日宣告退出國聯、外幣省調查之對政府報告書、原文甚長、兹將内容之槪要、略誌於下、以供世人之參考、</p>

<p>（一）各國經騐世界大戰之結果痛感第十六條之基本的意義及國際義務、應以國際的制裁、實行遵守、因大戰以前國際的制裁協定之實行、在慣例上及法規上殆無存在、故確實主張此、者亦極少、在此意味、本條約爲盟約諸條約中、有重本意義者也、且對於國聯之組織附以極大之特性、蓋國際的聯合團體雖不少、然規定對於違反團體會章之國家、實行共同制裁者、除國聯以外無其他之團體、此種制裁之適用不限定於違反盟約之特殊規定時、（參考第十六條第一項）定　適用於侵犯一般的法規之時者、適合國聯之精神固不待言也、</p>
<p>（二）作爲解釋第十六條規定指南之國聯决議、國聯鑑於第十六條規定之不完全、其改正或解釋之問題、早已成爲討論之題目、卽第一次國聯大會（一九二○年）曾命理事會設立﹁關於封鎖之國際委員會﹂以研究本條中經濟封鎖問題、次年第二次大會、參的各委員會討議之結果、採擇四種改正規約案及多數解釋的决議、照此等各案、因未經必要的批准、（第二十六條）尚未發效果、</p>
<p>（三）適用第十六條制裁之條件、</p>
<p>Ａ·經濟的及軍事的處置（第十六條第一項）之條件、</p>
<p>本制裁須對於﹁蔑視第十條第三條或第十五條規定而出於戰爭之國聯會員國﹂爲之、然經濟的及軍事的處置非獨在上項塲合時所必要之制裁也、違反第十條第十一條第一項第十二條第四項第十七條第四項等各規定時亦可考慮之問題、然則違反此等各規定之行爲、卽所謂﹁侵略戰爭﹂之存否、究由何人决定乎、依照第十六條之明文及第二次國聯大會决議之第四項、由國聯各國本身有其法定權者明瞭之事也、然關於此事應注意之點如次、</p>
<p>（一）各國之獨立存續權、在於第十六條、决非有任意之例外、如國聯國獲得違反第十六條之確證則有適用本條制裁之義務、</p>
<p>（二）國聯諸國關於違反盟約之存否問題、意見不能一致時、始將發生困難之狀態、（例如甲國因信乙國實行侵略戰爭而對此宣戰制裁、然内國反認甲國有違反盟約等事）第二次大會曾希望理事會以多數决議、發表關於此問題之意見、並望各國照此意見行動、然因該意見無拘束力、各國仍然可不待理事會發表意見、而任意採取獨立行動、其結果、尤其有會員國反對理事會多數之意見、而　定違反盟約存在之時、必生極危險之狀態、本條規定之缺點實在於此也、</p>
<p>Ｂ·開除（第十六條第四項之條件）　　開除之制裁與經濟的及軍事的處置不同、有一國故意違反盟約時可行使之、</p>
<p>（四）制裁之實行　　Ａ·槪况</p>
<p>第十六條規定所謂經濟封鎖、兵力的制裁及開除制裁、作爲制裁之方法、其中開除一節無問題、然各國對於違反國實行如何程度之經濟及兵力的制裁、不　諸論也、又關連於此、須　考慮外交關係之斷絶、第十六條第一項之條文、使人發生推察、解釋侵略戰爭之結果、侵略國與國聯全國間之戰爭狀態是非自動成立據此見解、國聯全國對於違反國立卽表示戰爭態度、同時外交關係亦當然斷絶、必要時準備實行峻嚴之經濟及軍事的制度、然此種解釋、國聯的數國最以爲痛苦、起草此文者亦恐未得可能實行之確信、故第二次大會、解釋本條之明文爲﹁違反國之片面行爲不得産生戰爭狀態、其行爲僅有宣言實行戰爭行爲、或違反國與國聯國之間有戰爭狀態之可能性而己、但在國聯、最少阻止戰爭、且以經濟壓迫、企圖和平之恢復爲適合於盟約精神之行爲也、（决議第二）、如有違反盟约者、不必立卽實現經濟封鎖之一切效果、先可實行較輕微之處置、而漸王嚴重之處置、（决議第十四）、國聯國承認侵略戰爭之存在時、均要實行經濟制裁、固不待言（第十六條）、但據前項决議第三、應否對於違反國宣戰、其權能在於各國、故不欲參加經濟封鎖或與建反國宣戰之國聯會員國亦有之、（此時外交關係是否斷絶行章將述）、第二次大會承認委任兩二國家實行經濟制裁之事、及准許某種國家在一定條件之下、得延期參加經濟處置之全部或一部、（决議第九及第十八第四項之追加議定書）、故如得理事會之許可、雖知有違反盟約之事、然可不參加制裁行爲也、卽據第二次大會之决議及改正案、本條規定之義務稍可减輕、反而言之、違反盟約之明文者、反適合國聯之精神也、（但因此種决議未有拘束力、各國亦得主張反面之解釋）、然對於國聯諸國與以卽時宣戰之權利、可謂危險之極、吾人仍希望迄理事會發表意見以前、各國須延於行動也、</p>
<p>Ｂ外交關係之斷絶</p>
<p>（一）違反國與對此宣戰之國聯國間其外交關係當然斷絶</p>
<p>（二）不與違反國宣戰之國聯國亦有斷絶次項外交關係之義務、以助經濟封銀之絶對成功、但領事館關係可以存續、（第二次大會决議第十二、）</p>
<p>（三）對於侵略國之制裁、以國聯名義爲之、故國聯機關對於侵略國之代行、亦要停止、但外交關係之斷絶暫可止於召回大使或公使、（第二次大會决議第十一、）又違反國人民之爲國聯秘書處職員者、仍可留駐原職、蓋其就任中可謂脫離本國國籍也、</p>
<p>Ｃ第十六條規之制裁中最重要之經濟封鎖</p>
<p>（一）本條之經濟封鎖及國際法上之封鎖、與從來國際法規所規定之平時封鎖或戰時封鎖不同、</p>
<p>卽從來國際法上之封鎖、國内法上無禁止此行爲之義務、然據第十六條、規定各國聯國對於自國國民或自國商船與以禁止與違反國人民交通之國内法義務、且國聯國須要防壓違反國國民與其他國民之交通、此種處置、不論其在陸上或海上、不按國際法令、亦可實行、此卽與所謂平時及戰時封鎖不同之點也、故在國聯國之間、不成問題、然對於非國聯國或國聯國中不認侵略戰爭之存續又不同意適用第十六條制裁者、應根基於一般國際法實行封鎖、現在國際法上平時封鎖、不得涉及於第三國之船舶、又對於違反封鎖行爲之船舶、祗得扣留載貨、不得没收其船、故比較戰時封鎖其効果甚翁、故如違反國有海界之時、欲達本條制裁之完全目的、須要實行本條規定之經濟封鎖、同時實行戰時封鎖、又第四條第一項後段所規定之防壓建反國與其他一切國家間金融、通商個人交通之義務、非實行戰時封銀、不能行使之、故雖採取侵略戰爭之國與其他一切國聯國之間、未立於戰爭狀態之解釋雖成立（參考上章Ａ）然參加對於有海界國家經濟封鎖之國、不得不對該國家立於戰爭狀態也、</p>
<p>（二）開始經濟封鎖之時期、</p>
<p>第十六條第二項規定國聯國全體對於違反國卽時斷絶一切關係、由此項本來之意義觀、各國聯國在其抱持確有侵略戰爭之　解時、卽要開始經濟封鎖、而不得待他國出於此處置也、然爲經濟封鎖之成功、各國採取統一行動爲絶對必要、故理事會關於開始經濟封鎖期及種類程度、發表意見後、各國開始行動則可、第二次大會决定　此改章、而規定理事會對於國聯諸國通告實行經濟的制裁之時期、（第三次追加議書）、然各國之獨立决定權仍然存在、</p>
<p>今日原則、各國認有侵略戰爭時、隨時得開始行動也</p>
<p>（三）各國關於經濟封銀之處置</p>
<p>第十六條第一項之後段規定國聯國對於違反國應取經濟封鎖手段之効用、據此規定、凡認有侵略戰爭之國聯國、須要（一）斷絶自國與違反國之一切通商反金融關係、（二）禁止自國民與違反國民間一切交通、（三）採取積極手段防阻他國與違反國之一切通商金融及國人之關係、</p>
<p>權利義務與從來國院法上封鎖之權利義務不同者旣述矣、國聯國欲實行此義務、必要採取國内立法的處置、（第二次大會决議第十九）、上述（二）之交通禁　是否在國籍地或居住地行施、此爲重大問題也、第十六條之條文、一見似取國籍主義然封鎖委員會採用居住主義第二次大會亦採擇此主張、（决議第十三　第十六條第一項之改正諸定書）、因此封鎖國之住民與被封鎖國之住民不得繼續任何關係、然監禁違反國人民、扣留商店、實行動則要禁止之、其後在第四次人會以居住主義爲原則、决定國聯國得任意併用國籍主義、但此改正案均未發生効力、故現行法上似不得强要國聯國實行居主義、但兹最要注意者爲第二次大會、規定各國不必立卽實行最峻嚴之經濟的制裁、得以漸進的步驟實行之事也、（决議第十四）故不必立卽訪碍一切貨物運往違反國、又得僅僅禁止重要物品之運輸以爲經濟及軍事之抵抗之作用、</p>
<p>（四）諸國間之恊力、及非會員國之參加經濟封鎖行爲、</p>
<p>國聯國實行第十六條第三項關於軍事經濟制裁時、互相援助以免其損失及不使之止於最少限度、第二次大會關於國聯國間此種連帶關係、要求各國接受理事會之勸告、允諾担任特殊任務、同時對於因參加共同制裁行爲而受大打擊之諸國、在一定條件之下、寛放其參加或延期、（决議第九及第四項追加議定書）、理事會爲與非國聯國協力起見、須要努力訂立協定（第二次大會决議第十七）但理事會與非國聯國之全部訂立此種協定、實不可能、故實行經濟封鎖時、同時有實行戰時封鎖之必要、</p>
<p>Ｄ兵力的制裁</p>
<p>國聯之任務以力避宣戰及兵力的制裁而以經濟壓迫回復和平　其本務、（第二次大會决議第三）、宣戰不必與軍事的處置結合、爲示威目的或完全實行經濟封鎖行爲起見之宣戰亦有之、適用兵力的制裁　理事會須要依　第十六條第二項對於國聯各國提議各國陸海空軍之分担制度、以擁護　約、此種提案在經濟封鎖、戰時（封鎖併行之時亦係必要、各國在必要之限度内、參加兵力制裁爲原則、然理事會之提議無拘束力、故各國得以相當之理由拒絶參加兵力制裁、但此拒絶並非否認法律的拘束之存在也、認有侵略戰爭之國聯國雖不參加兵力制裁、然　准許參加兵力制裁國家之軍隊通過其領土、又須如第十六　第三項所規定、有互相援助之之義務、故此種國聯國無中立之權利義務、而有一種特别之立塲也、與違反國對抗之各國應作爲國聯之機關行動一切、國聯依隊第十一條規定、以該國聯國與違反國之戰爭爲國聯全體之利害關　、而得干涉此事（德國國際法律學者西金氏說）、</p>
<p>Ｅ、開除、</p>
<p>開除制裁祗得對於有侵略戰爭責任之國聯國實行之、然非由世界大國全部參加國聯、開除之結果受其損害者非違反國而國聯本身也、開除處分、非由理事會（除違反國）全體一致同意不能實行</p>
<p>（五）制裁所要之費用、</p>
<p>違反國担任爲自國行動所要之一切經費並賠償損害、當然之事、然諸國不能履行時、國聯之行動經費（尤其是軍事費）由國聯担負、而各國聯國因經濟封鎖所得之損害亦由各國担負之、</p>
<p>（六）第十六條之中立</p>
<p>（一）對於第十六條之適用完全中立者爲不行侵略戰爭又不參加制裁之非國聯國也、</p>
<p>（二）國聯國雖不宣戰、但認有侵略戰爭則不能在中立地位、其有一種特别之措置、如上所述矣、（三）不認有侵略戰爭又不參加第十六條制裁行爲之國聯國究在何種地位、此等諸國是否負第十六條第三項之義務、屬疑問、由使國聯之制裁容易實行之見地而說、如此等諸國負其義務則其中立亦應限制、（立作太郎博十說）、然在上項（一二）兩節、違反國應否甘受此中立制度、是别問題也、又非國聯國拒絶接受盟約第十七條第一項之義務、而與接受國聯意見之非國聯國戰爭時、（第十七條第三項）、因此兩國均不受盟約之拘束、諸國得對於國聯國全體　求遵守中立之放棄、國聯國上項（一二）之行爲違反中立、</p>
<p>（七）結論、（第十六條適用之困難）、</p>
<p>第十六條雖　國聯盟約中有重要意味之現定、然因其有特異性、且因國聯無全世界的性質、當其實施之際、發生積種困難、此據上述理由略可明白之、國聯創立以來未曾見此條文之適用、蓋受損害者非被開除國而國聯本身故也、共力的制裁雖似强力、然理事會决定各或担任之陸海空軍數實不可能、故本條制裁之發動可謂絶對不能實現矣、至於最重要之經濟封鎖、又以如次理由、似難實行</p>
<p>（一）經濟封鎖對於違反國所與之經濟上、金融上之損害頗大、然同時參加經濟制裁之國亦受多大之損失及不便、如上所述、</p>
<p>（二）經濟封鎖必要帶同戰時封鎖、然此兵力制裁之實行困難亦已述矣、（）蓋非國聯國犧牲其自由、忍受損失及不便而援助經濟制裁之事不致有也）、</p>
<p>（三）其他因規定方法之不完全、發生種種困難旣如上述、卽（一）各國因有獨立之决定權、確定是非違反條約、實行經濟封鎖等事、恐不能採取統一行動、又國聯以惡意濫用本條制裁之事亦許有之、（二）第十六條第一項明文所規定之國籍主義實際上頗難實行、（主張居住主義之改修規定尚未發生拘束力）、（三）因中立關係發生種種困難問題、國聯國互相援助不中能、</p>

<p>我國濟組組織散漫戰時優於日本</p>
<p>對日直接交涉非不可爲乃不可能</p>
<p>不長司法願盡力直接有關國難者</p>

<p>據伍氏云、中國在此時期、軍事爲重、外交次之、但有一利器、其力量效用、實與軍事同重要、或且較勝於軍事、惜猶未能善自運用耳、其事惟何、　經濟是也、蓋我國經濟無組織、然仍保持固有之農村社會經濟狀况、故甲地發生一問題、其餘各地、雖難免蒙受影響但决不致牽動全局、唯其如是、故在經濟上與日本比較、實　優於彼、而常能保持各個經濟獨立之精神、日本在經濟中爲有組織之國家、唯其有組織、常見其一地發生問題、動輒牽制全局、是以在平時我國經濟之無組織、實爲一大缺點、但在此多難之秋、正是以見其長、故以比較而言、在軍事上之設備、我與日較、相　甚遠、惟在經濟上則我長彼短、國人當知己知彼、運用自己之長以制彼之短、運用之法唯何、即實行抵貨、予以經濟制裁、蓋日貨之輸入我國、猶坦克車飛機之在魯峯口石門寨其爲害實　烈、今國人倡言爲國家軍事後盾、本人間爲捨此實無第二法、較之空言救國、相去何止千里、不見乎德國之排猶乎、命令朝發而夕至、舉國一致、其精神何等整齊、此固其組織交通完備、但在我國當由國人自動、始克有濟、蓋　由政府領導、而人民漠然不動、又何益乎、余有友已數十年不用日貨、其原因雖未明、但國人如人人有此精神、則必可制日以死命也、</p>
<h3 id="c269">直接交涉 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>至於直接交涉、國際兩國往來、莫不直接交涉、中國與日本何嘗不可直接交涉、但現在日本與中國之情勢、因一直接交涉、日本必要求承認僞組織、及種種非法之要求、則又有何交涉可言、簡言之、非直接交涉之不可以、實係直接交涉之不可能、至國聯二十二國顧問委員會之進展如何、現尚未可預料、惟比會之設、亦不過視全局轉移如何而定其應付之方針也</p>
<h3 id="c270">委任統治 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>德美之要求日本歸還南洋委治權、現雖略趨沉寂、但將來必仍有解决之一日、蓋以現在情形觀之、似尚祇德美兩國、惟英國因澳洲南洋之關係、將來亦必起而過問此事、現德國因排猶問題、較嚴重於此事、故暫時無積極態度、一俟排猶解决、則必從而解决此問題、至其結果如何、現實難說、惟如意相墨索里尼之四强公約成功、則解必甚易易也、</p>

<p>又謂中央請本人出任司法部長、此事在京時雖曾聞有是說、本人實未同意、且已正式辭謝、或　　謂在此時期、大家應共赴國難、惟本人此後必與一國難直接有關者、願盡其力也、又外交委員長一席當本人前次出席外交委員會時、即已聲明不就、僅允任臨時主席而已、近頗有人作書於予、直接書外交委員長者實屬誤會也、</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>人類的愚蠢是無可諱飾的一件事，一般人早已忘却一九一四年大戰的慘怛的印象，而正積極地從事於第二次大破壞的準備，而且戰員也已配置好了，只待那一聲動員令下，</p>
<p>關於這次戰爭的性質及其所屬的戰員，且讓我們來聽帝國主義先鋒隊的供狀吧，</p>
<p>﹁現在世界只有二種國家，一種是資本主義，英美日意法，一種係共産主義，蘇俄，現在要想抵制蘇俄，非中日聯合起來，再疏通英美意法了解共其作法，不能成功，﹂丨見三月二十九日申報所載日僞中華聯邦密約，</p>
<p>。　　，這口號，不　是遠東，在世界各處早已吹着，。</p>
<p>人類的愚蠢與嫉妬，固不自今日始，但到今日而更顯著，麻面的姑娘，偏會吃醋，這也許是人類的本能，帝國主義間因着本身的百孔千瘡，無可補救，於是看到蘇聯五年計劃的成功而更加眼紅，便想奮這麽埀死的一擊，這實是歷史所决定無可避免的運命，因爲新的時代必須從舊的軀殻裏産生，。而生長在舊時代裏的人們，。又無法可使其生存到新世界裏來，。因爲呼吸的不同，。必然地要自盡於舊世界裏，。這實是人類愚蠢所造成的最大的悲劇，。但對於一個自願自盡的人，憑你有多少的仁慈，那可有什麽法想呢？最大的仁慈，便是早點完成他的志願，所以從歷史上從帝國主義的本身上講，這一次世界大戰，便不是無意義的，這次戰爭的性。質，已换了一種新的成分，。與上次帝國主義間的混戰不同，在縱的方面，。雖然是國際的戰爭，。但在横的方面，。却是十二萬五千萬被壓迫的奴隷向統治者爭取自由的戰爭，。所以值得我們另眼看待，。</p>
<p>但我們是屬那一組的呢？丨在這次大戰中。丨非得細細思量一下以决定我們的命運不可，。事實是已不容你再躱在旁邊看熱閙了。。</p>
<p>從日僞密約看起來，日本頗有甘充先鋒之概，爲了取得更大的效果起見，中國便在這先鋒的﹁便宜行事﹂之下犧牲了。但對於這個配角的重要性，他是不能抹殺的，更感於名義上的孤立，於是雖没有組織聯軍的提議，却虚擬了一個﹁中華聯邦帝國﹂來做精神上的安慰者，。這也可見先鋒隊的大不易做，。與侵略者的煞費苦心。</p>
<p>這一切都是廢話，最後眞實的决定，還在我們願走那一條路？。</p>
<p>在過去丨或許現在還如此，咱們貴國是傾倒於歐美帝國主義的御座前的，﹁中國現在是傾心於日内瓦﹂，即非老奸巨滑如李頓也可看出，而且幾年前我們也曾打過﹁頭陣﹂但强權的外國人太不容情，。非但不加以矜憐，。還把他一脚踢出了日内瓦，。於是在﹁忠義堂﹂上的寶座中佔得一個末席的夢想，也終於打破了，但天生的根性，又不容改、於是引領西望，像一個被遺棄的婦人一樣地徬徨着，造成幾年來的混沌現象，若問我們在這世上究屬於那一組的，。我們的回答是﹁無類可歸。﹂。</p>
<p>第一我們不是資本主義的國家是很顯然的，丨。雖然儘向着帝國主義送秋波，。但在﹁遺敎﹂裏還有一點﹁打倒帝國主義﹂的口號存在，。而且也正劇烈地受着壓迫。但我們又决不是社會主義的國家，。我們正努力於﹁勦匪﹂運動，。所以我們究屬那一組，。很難說出。這樣旣不是帝國主義的一份子，。又不是社會主義的好朋　　　歷　這個世界　　我們是突　於那一</p>

<p>丨寫給友人疾仇丨</p>
<p>我久想寫這麽一個信給你，却不知你的萍踪安在，在這世界的尖端，我固被踏下了萬仭的深壑，而你也怎麽遇着同樣的遭際呵！</p>
<p>比來春神到了人間，每早稀疏的太陽，從朝東的窗縫裏射進了，我的蝸角般大的棲留室，單薄的被褥上似乎晃動着縷絲的煖潮，呵，自然的賜予，倒還一視同仁，爲了怕辜負了這太陽的恩澤，我興奮的跳下了床沿。</p>
<p>然而也就在這時候觸發了我的感端，要是富有的人兒，還不是在温暖的被褥裏，緊摟着女人，做着他們的天國之夢麽，爲的是時代特優了他們，金錢在他們的周遭翻滾。另一羣，也許已在開始着生活的忙碌了，開門七件事，第一趕快提着竹筐往小菜塲去，攘來熙去，又誰不在白夢着上昇天堂，建立着個人安逸的基石呵！</p>
<p>事實上已成了大衆叛徒的我怎樣也踏不進一般的生活圈子，我只是廻想：昨早不曾吃大餅，肚皮兒怪餓，今早可就平常了是的呵！這算得什麽！就是中午，甚至連夜飯也没有着落，又有什麽要緊！壓根兒說，在這充滿了豺狼的社會上，我們還未被他們吞噬，已算是萬幸！我認淸了這一點所以每回遇到肚皮餓了，便是這樣自慰着。</p>
<p>然而問題在那裏？</p>
<p>我只想在這社會裏，使我們靑年憂忿痛心的事可眞多極了，周遭的物觀環境，映進我們的眼簾，便是一重重的打擊，看呀，在那邊的，擊羣，假着拍，吹，諂，傲，壓迫，吸吮，的種種卑汚手腕，是滿在乎的享受酒池肉林，服用麗都，高樓大厦，享樂之不足，還要不時的玩弄害羣的勾當，這邊的一羣，終日的勞苦奔波，還是要挨凍，受餒，充分的表現着兩個懸殊天壤的世界，這是多麽使人痛恨的事呵！</p>
<p>看呀，整個民族的生命，已是萬分的危殆了，東北之失，滬役之屈辱，就算把它　開不談，日本軍閥隠燭了我們的當道原没有什麽民族觀念，更其猛烈的占下我們的熱河了，我國雖然平日養兵十萬，臨陣時却抗不過百數十人的日兵這是什麽道理？眞的抵不過麽，那是三尺童子却不會置信，爲的是自家的利害關係，爲的是没有决心去抵抗，所以日兵能長驅直入，所以我們的國土，便失了一省，又失一省，所以民族日益臨近了毁滅的尖端。</p>
<p>這些不都是比個人問題更嚴重麽！古語有云：﹁皮之不存，毛將安附，﹂已就痛切的說明這意義了。</p>
<p>固然，切身的個人問題，需要迫切的解决，但這問題的關鍵，却寄托在大衆的身上，整個民族國家的身上，要解决個人問題，也同樣要解决大衆的及民族國家的問題。</p>
<p>時代之輪，把我們輾下了萬仭的深壑，我們可就任憑它輾壓麽！</p>
<p>只管悲觀消極，是毁滅自身的朕兆一味瞎衝横撞，同樣也是無補于事實，我們所需要的是一種具有酵素的實力。　　朋友，你是我們這一羣的中幹，雖然你也遇着同樣的遭際，愧我只有這麽一些感發，請給我一個具體化的解答吧！</p>
<p>祝　　好</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3 id="c281">君子可欺以其方 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>讀了金女士所作的﹁愛情是不是同時可以容納幾個人的﹂店員通訊後，腦筋中深印着兩種感想，第一種感想，男女職員，同事一起，應該相互尊重人格，第二種感想，甫在萌芽時代的女子職業；應該加以保護。</p>
<p>我也曾聽到過所謂皇后的金女士，精神上十分痛苦，不過伊所謂精神上十分痛苦，在此不在彼。</p>
<p>因爲伊面貌比較好些，引起了少數男同事們的注意，有些寫情書去逗引伊，有些打烊後去追求伊，有些平時候去作弄伊，如蠅附羶的纏個不了，但是伊終是淡如水冷若氷的給他們一個不理不睬。</p>
<p>閉門家裏坐，禍從天上來，因爲目的難遂，就想出種種方法去破壞伊，中傷伊。最近又冐充金女士的名義來抽投稿貴刻，以妨書金女士的名譽，同時也有以藉貴刊的力量，使經理明白男女同事的非計，改變方針，以冀達到摧殘女子職業的地步，其用心的險詐，可見一班。</p>
<p>編者先生：一個女子連　擇一個男子的能力丨丨判斷力丨丨都没有，談不到戀愛神聖，更談不到女子職業。</p>
<p>﹁熊掌我所願也，魚亦我所願也，﹂這兩句話，侮辱女性達於極點，眞正的金女士看了不知要發生何種感想呢。</p>
<p>我是一個乂乂國貨社服務十多年的老世兄，同時也是一個兒女成羣的有婦使君，已談不到戀愛，更談不到酸性作用，不過爲了女子職業前途着想，不得不仗義執言一下，請先生有以敎我，如以爲尚含有别種作用，不妨到敝社來調查一下。戈再渡啟</p>
<p>乂　　乂　　乂　　乂　　乂</p>
<p>編者按：讀了戈君的來信，才知道前天我們發表的那封金女士的來信，是出於她的男同事們的揑造。而且揑造這封信的動機，非常卑鄙。於此我們不能不向金女士與戈君，深致十二萬分的歉意。我們不敢將自己的差誤，秘而不宣；所以今天特地把戈君的信，在此發表，希望社會人士，與金女士店裏的經理，明瞭這個事實之後，不致中這班不成才的鬼計。</p>
<p>自從本欄出世以來，巳經三個多月了；回想在這三個多月裏，我們對於店員們的問題，無不竭盡智力，很誠懇地去解答。我們原希望借這很微薄的力量，多少來解除店員們的痛苦。這種服務社會的精神，凡是天天讀我們通訊的人士，大槪都能夠領略吧！不料﹁君子可欺以其方，﹂我們這種一片婆心，竟會被若輩利用，言之實在痛心。末了我們不得不借用戈君的口氣，大聲地喊：希望社會人士，對於這服務社會的本欄，加以愛護。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十六號是弄底最後的一宅，意大利鄉村式的建築，滿佈着花卉的庭園；同時，屋子裏又有人在彈琴，繚亮而幽美的琴聲，輕輕地越過了半掩着的紗窗，很悠揚地度將出來，使伍逸站在門外，恣意的欣賞着，竟懶得伸起手來掀電鈴了。</p>
<p>﹁老伍！怎不進去﹂？玉麟恰巧也才從外面回來，便用他手裏所提着的一個公事包，着力望正在聽琴聲聽得出神的伍逸身上一撞。</p>
<p>﹁啊！這琴彈得正好······﹂丨伍逸一面隨玉麟走進屋子去，一面這樣讚美着。其時琴聲已停了。</p>
<p>﹁大槪是Ｗife彈的吧﹂！玉麟走在前面，用鑰匙開了門上的彈簧鎖，然後又側過身子，讓伍逸先走進去，</p>
<p>在一架黑色的大鋼琴的旁邊，玉立亭亭地站着一位披一件淡綠色的新裝的女人。她身量很嬌小，臉龐微圓，腥紅的嘴唇，活潑而有神的眸子，很淸楚地顯示着她的超人的健美。</p>
<p>﹁這是吾Wife，這就是老伍！哈哈！有趣得很，老伍你竟是第一次見媒人咧！不該謝謝嗎﹂？玉麟丢掉了手裏的公事包，先自望一張沙發上躺了下去，很興奮地笑着。</p>
<p>眞的，這是一件很奇怪的事情！伍逸雖然跟玉麟是最知已的老朋友，可是在今天以前，却始終不曾見過他的夫人。原因倒並不怎樣反常，因爲當伍逸才回國的時候，毛菊芬女士剛在生産，産後又害了一次很厲害的病，足足在醫院裏休養了一年多，所以伍逸和劉素珍女士的結合，雖然她是唯一的介紹人，然而在訂婚和結婚的時候，她竟因病而兩度缺席：待她病好之後，也曾到伍逸府上去過幾次，但是她每次去總在早上，伍逸好夢方酣，當然不能見面；中間還有六七個月，她是上天津去探訪她底姑母去的；有了這三重原因，伍逸跟她兩人便像捉迷藏似的老是碰不到了。</p>
<p>﹁嫂嫂﹂！伍逸先依着通常的習慣，恭恭敬敬地招呼一聲。</p>
<p>﹁啊！伍先生，我時常想見你，偏是老不凑巧丨今天我們才認識，眞有趣極了﹂！毛女土雖然巳是一個生過孩子的母親，可是她的年齡實在祇有二十四歲，比伍逸玉麟少得多了丨因此，她還很充分地保住着她的天眞，說話比玉麟更爽利，態度當然比每一個女人都大方了。</p>
<p>伍逸也覺得今天這一見面眞是很奇突，而有味的，臉上透着滿意的微笑。　　﹁伍先生！你在星報上每天寫的那一段﹁甜酸苦辣﹂，委實又滑稽，又深刻，眞不知道你是怎樣想出來的﹂！毛女士就靠在鄰近伍逸座位的一張旋椅上，很熱烈地向他表示仰慕，似乎是揆别多年的老友，一朝見面，便有無窮的言語要傾吐的一般。﹁我聽素珍姊說，你用心思用得很厲害，往往會在吃飯的時候，突然擱下碗來；的確，寫東西是很苦的，要寫得好更不容易，看的人　覺得有趣，永遠不知道寫的人的費力！﹂</p>

<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that the enemy and rebel armies launched a large-scale attack on the Shimenzhai and Shi River line this time. Our army has indeed withdrawn to a certain position. The fierce battle this time was extremely fierce. Both the enemy and we suffered heavy casualties. However, our army's withdrawal was purely a predetermined plan. Because the Shi River-Qinhuangdao line is a protruding terrain, and it is under enemy pressure on three sides. Forcing us to defend the area would have caused great sacrifice. Militarily, we should avoid the heavy and choose the light. This withdrawal is a military plan, not a retreat due to defeat. It has no impact on the overall military situation. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang was said to have received urgent telegrams from He Guoguang and other military officers stationed in Jiangxi for several days, stating that the Red Bandits were rampant and Nanchang and Fuzhou were both in dire straits, and requesting that Chiang quickly come to Jiangxi to lead the army in suppression so as to pacify them as soon as possible. Chiang believed that the various military affairs in Nanjing had been roughly arranged, and that the Jiangxi bandits should be suppressed urgently, so at 10:00 AM on the 4th, he ordered the naval department to order the Chuyou and Chutai warships to prepare their engines. Then, at the military academy residence, he summoned Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi and others, instructing them on military affairs. At 12:15 PM, he took a car with his secretary Deng Wenyi and dozens of guards to the naval pier. Tang Shengzhi, Zhu Peide, Gu Zhenglun, Chen Zhuo, He Yaozu and others went to see him off. Chen Shaokuan personally took care of things at the pier, and the security was tight along the way. Chiang arrived at Xiaguan, shook hands with those who came to see him off, and boarded the Chuyou warship westward. The accompanying guards and others took the Chutai warship to escort him. It is expected that he will arrive at Xun at noon on the 5th, transfer by car to the Jiangxi capital, and summon the military officers to instruct them on the strategy of suppressing the bandits.

The main force of the Zhu and Mao counterfeit 1, 3, and 5 armies, originally stationed in Jinzhu, on February 26 and 27, our 52 and 59 divisions advanced from Le'an to suppress them. Because the army moved too quickly, it was ambushed, and there was a bloody battle for several days and nights. Fortunately, the 11th Division rushed from Yihuang and defeated the bandits. The bandits suffered heavy losses, and our 52 and 59 divisions also suffered considerable losses. It is estimated that Chen Shiji, commander of the 59th Division, was captured and died tragically, Li Ming, commander of the 52nd Division, was injured and committed suicide, Yang Deliang, brigade commander, was injured, Fang Jing was seriously injured, and Fu Zhongfang's life and death are unknown.

<h3 id="e27">Sincere Reflections on Mr. Ye Hongying's Donation for Education <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Ye Hongying of this city will donate all of his hard-earned savings, except for specific provisions, to establish education, specifically designating it for libraries and rural education. The donation amounts to millions. In today's world, where everyone is focused on personal benefit, Mr. Ye has achieved such a great enlightenment, returning the wealth of society to society. This is truly a rare and commendable act, worthy of the deepest respect from the world.</p>
<p>Those with shallow views each pursue private ownership, taking from society only to accumulate and not disperse, toiling their whole lives. Besides their own enjoyment, they also plan for their descendants, wanting to ensure that their descendants for hundreds of generations can enjoy this without fear of cold or hunger. We will not even say that this kind of behavior is an absolutely stupid act of individualism. Generally speaking, a huge amount of inheritance is also sufficient to cultivate the laziness of descendants, making them rely on the legacy of their ancestors, not seeking self-reliance, only knowing how to enjoy.纨绔子弟 (playboys) are invariably descendants of the extremely wealthy, indulging in extravagance and lacking knowledge of hardship, sitting and eating without any skills. Until finally, they invariably squander their family fortune, becoming impoverished and unable to support themselves. Therefore, bequeathing wealth to descendants ultimately harms them, no different from binding their hands and feet, making them unable to work and unable to support themselves, not becoming a "person" beneficial to society, but a worm knowing only how to consume. How can it compare to using the wealth of society for society, not only planning for oneself but also not only planning for one's family? One does not become enslaved by wealth, nor does one make one's descendants enslaved by wealth and burdened by it. Being able to accumulate and being able to disperse, allowing society to benefit from it. This kind of behavior is not only supremely virtuous in action but also supremely joyful in mind. Helping others helps oneself; benefiting others benefits oneself. The far-reaching calculations and profound insights are certainly beyond the imagination and comprehension of the average "miser." This is why we sincerely express our respect for Mr. Ye's act of donating his private property for public use.</p>
<p>However, we currently have no way of knowing the management policies of the library and rural education that Mr. Ye designated. Therefore, we also have a word to say to the persons in charge of this matter. Considering the current situation in our country, the management of libraries should strive to be mass-oriented and universal so that the masses can benefit from it and should never only be for the appreciation of a few or the research of one or two experts. Today's society is becoming increasingly impoverished, and education has become a commodity. The majority of the lower-class masses have no opportunity to study, but their desire for knowledge is extremely keen. Take the experience of the mobile library recently established by this newspaper as an example. The reason why this newspaper established this mobile library was to provide ordinary citizens with the opportunity to read in their spare time with the most convenient procedures. Anyone who wants to borrow a book only needs to pay a security deposit of one or two yuan. The procedure can be said to be extremely simple. However, there are still readers who request the return of the security deposit midway for the purpose of buying rice for their families at the moment, thus having to temporarily sacrifice their opportunity to read. "Survival" and "seeking knowledge" often conflict. This extremely sad fact can be used to infer the general situation of the public. Therefore, now that Mr. Ye has donated a huge amount of funds, it should be used urgently to relieve the public's knowledge panic so that the public can all have the opportunity to seek knowledge because of Mr. Ye's donation. This is the library we hope for. Secondly, rural education is also extremely important. We have said before that today's education has generally become a commodity. Knowledge must be exchanged for money, and knowledge is often monopolized by a few. As for the poor children in rural areas, they grow up in a state of ignorance and illiteracy for their entire lives. This is the case for this generation, and it will still be the case for the next generation. The gilded school gates cause the poor to sigh in vain. Therefore, today, when we talk about eliminating illiteracy and improving social culture, vigorously implementing rural education is an extremely urgent and important plan. However, the implementation of rural education should focus on being practical, focusing on reaping the greatest benefits with the lowest possible cost, and not on exaggerating and flaunting, talking grandly about ideologies, wasting a lot of money, and having little practical effect. This is also the rural education we hope for.</p>
<p>In summary, Mr. Ye has already donated this huge amount of money. The question from now on is how to use this money properly and how to make society benefit from it. We especially hope that the country's wealthy will hear the news and follow in Mr. Ye's footsteps, continuing this righteous act. "Who does not want to do good as much as I do?" We will wait and see.</p>

Last year, the US government ordered each ship to start laying off Chinese employees. Initially, each company did not agree to lay them off because Chinese employees had lower wages, in order to save expenses. Later, the government limited the implementation and reported the increased expenses after laying off Chinese employees so that the government could subsidize them. Therefore, from August last year to February this year, more than 6,000 Chinese workers and sailors have been laid off, reaching more than two-thirds. It is expected that by the end of this year, the remaining one-third of Chinese workers will be laid off completely. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Prime Minister Will Visit the Genro Again to Seek Understanding</p>
<p>The Current Cabinet's Life May Not Exceed May</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito met with Finance Minister Takahashi at the Prime Minister's residence at 9:35 this morning. The two elderly men held a secret discussion about the future of the Japanese political situation for a long time. It is said that Takahashi's intention to resign is very firm and the Prime Minister cannot persuade him to stay. At 10:50, the Prime Minister met with Justice Minister Oyama again. Although Saito tried his best to persuade him to stay temporarily, Oyama replied that the May 15 Incident was closely related to the red judicial officers and that he could not help but resign to take responsibility. As a result, the Prime Minister's meeting with the two ministers was extremely pessimistic. It is said that Saito, realizing the darkness of the future, plans to rush to Okitsu to revisit Genro Saionji after the emergency cabinet meeting closes, requesting the Genro's understanding. General observations are that the Prime Minister's revisit to the Genro is mostly preparing for the procedure of stepping down, and this trip is even more noteworthy.

<p>(Tokyo) After today's emergency cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Saito contacted Finance Minister Takahashi and Justice Minister Oyama again. The Prime Minister told Takahashi that although the budget had been approved, the specific implementation methods were not yet complete. If he wanted to step down, he would have to wait until after the results of the local governors' meeting to be held on the 17th before he could hand over responsibility. He expressed the same to Justice Minister Oyama, saying that the preliminary hearing of the May 15 Incident would soon be completed and that the charges against the red judicial officer case would soon be clarified. If Justice Minister Oyama could wait until the conclusion of the case, Saito would share responsibility with Oyama. In any case, each cabinet member must automatically dismiss the intention to resign in mid-April. In May, after various key domestic and foreign affairs have reached their respective "stages," they can discuss the issue of advance and retreat again. According to reports from the cabinet, Takahashi and Oyama have slightly accepted Saito's difficulties, and both have expressed their consent. (4th China United Telegraph Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Seiyukai President Suzuki Kisaburo, who went to Yugawara Hot Spring to recuperate after the closure of the 64th Diet, suddenly received an emergency telegram from the Tokyo headquarters at 4:34 PM today, urging him to return to Tokyo. With the issue of Finance Minister Takahashi's resignation shelved, the actions of President Suzuki are particularly noteworthy. General speculation is that Suzuki intends to rush back to Tokyo to instigate a political change to be realized as soon as possible. (4th China United Telegraph Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Under the certainty that a political change is approaching, the Seiyukai is paying close attention to the political situation after Prime Minister Saito's visit to Genro. The Finance Minister's intention to resign is firm, and although the Prime Minister has repeatedly tried to persuade him to stay, he has not agreed. Furthermore, Justice Minister Oyama resigned to take responsibility due to ideological issues. In addition, the responsibility issues of Minister of Education Hatoyama and Minister of the Interior Yamamoto will ultimately be the responsibility of the Prime Minister. Therefore, the Seiyukai believes that supplementing and partially reforming cabinet members will not be able to muddle through for a while. As a result, the current cabinet will resign en masse at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. However, if the current cabinet does not resign even after May, the Seiyukai will withdraw cabinet members who are party members and decide to use the ultimate extraordinary means to collapse the cabinet. Therefore, even if it does not do this, the current cabinet will naturally collapse, saying that it is only a matter of time. (4th Electric Telegraph Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi met with the Prime Minister before the cabinet meeting this morning. Saito earnestly persuaded Takahashi not to have the intention of resigning. Takahashi said that he was afraid that it would be difficult to agree to the Prime Minister's persuasion. After the meeting, Takahashi told Japanese reporters that whether he goes to war or not is a personal matter and is not convenient to disclose. He did have a private agreement with Yu Mu in the Diet. This is a private matter between the two and cannot be made public. He is physically weak and unable to bear the heavy responsibility again. He has recommended Vice Minister Kuroda to succeed him. Only the Seiyukai expects a political change due to his resignation. However, even if a political change follows, the people may not be able to fully trust the current political parties. It is not yet possible to determine who will be the successor cabinet. Moreover, since he is resigning for health reasons, it stands to reason that it should not affect the fate of the Saito cabinet.

<p>(London) Japan's formal announcement to continue exercising its mandate over the Pacific islands has given newspapers here, which have been attacking Japan since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese dispute, another opportunity to criticize Japan's policies. The "Manchester Guardian" stated that "Japan's current claim is completely unreasonable. The resolution of October 1920 (referring to the resolution of the Allied Powers allocating mandated territories) has never been denied its validity to this day. If that resolution cannot determine the supreme sovereignty of the League of Nations over the mandated territories, then by what treaty can it be determined? Moreover, how can Japan justify accepting the mandate in the name of the League of Nations? This new attempt by Japan is sufficient to undermine the common law among nations and deserves Germany's repeated protests. If this attempt succeeds, then any attempt can succeed. The future of the mandate system will depend on this case." (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>European Four-Power Pact</p>
<h3 id="e71">France Prepares Counterproposal <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Emphasizing Security More Than British and Italian Plans</p>
<p>Opposing Treaty Revision and Maintaining the Rights of Small Nations</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 3rd - After discussing the Four-Power Pact plan agreed upon by British Prime Minister MacDonald and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome, France will submit another plan. France is giving full consideration to the opposition of the three Little Entente countries of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania to revising the treaty. After careful deliberation, the French cabinet has completed its draft statement, which emphasizes security more than the British and Italian plans. What it agrees with in the British and Italian plans is that the Four-Power Agreement should seek to resolve European problems through joint action, undertake not to increase armaments, and strive for an agreement on monetary issues. However, one matter that is very different from the original Italian proposal is the suggestion regarding treaty revision. France advocates that the signatory countries should comprehensively consider the Covenant of the League of Nations, so Article 19 of the Covenant must be handled in conjunction with Articles 3, 10, 11, and 16. Article 19 stipulates that the Assembly may reconsider treaties that are no longer applicable, while Articles 3 and 10 refer to events concerning world peace and the invasion of member states' territories. Therefore, France suggests that the undertaking of public safety should at least be given equal importance to the revision of treaties. The French do not regard this French draft as a counterproposal, but rather express the general principles in which France believes. The French draft also argues that whenever any issue arises involving any country other than the four powers, the countries concerned must always consult.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 3rd - The French cabinet decided tonight to send a note to Britain and Italy, stating that France in principle agrees with the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's Four-Power Peace Pact proposal as a basis for discussion, but at the same time put forward some counterproposals and reservations to protect the Little Entente countries. The three Little Entente countries (according to the recent agreement, the three Little Entente countries have become a unit in international affairs) do not approve of modifying the treaty in a way that would increase the combined power of Germany and Italy, and especially oppose changing the borders of European countries as stipulated in the treaty at present. Therefore, France will solemnly declare in the note that the time is not yet ripe for any modifications to the treaty that would affect borders, but it is the long-cherished wish of the major powers to conclude an agreement to maintain and promote peace in Europe without infringing upon the rights of small countries. According to French diplomatic circles, there had previously been statements that France could accept the Four-Power Pact, but on the condition that small countries not be forced to join and comply.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Thunderstorms Strike, US Navy Airship Crashes into Sea <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Only Four Rescued Out of Seventy-Seven Aboard</p>
<p>Airship Length 700 Feet, 4,000+ Horsepower</p>
<p>Cause of Accident Possibly Electrocution</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th - The U.S. Navy airship Akron, the largest airship in the world, is reported to have crashed into the sea off the coast of New Jersey. There were a total of seventy-seven people on board. The airship is still floating near the Barnegat lightship. According to a report from the German oil tanker Forbes, several people have been rescued, but not all of them. The airship is 785 feet long, with a diameter of 132 feet 9 inches at its narrowest point. Its body is made of aluminum mixed with copper, making it light and strong, consisting of ten million individual parts, 54,000 fine struts, and 6.5 million rivets, weighing approximately 221,000 pounds. It is equipped with four engines on each side, totaling 4,480 horsepower, all installed internally, with only the eight propellers extending outwards. Its brakes are located at the bottom of the bow, and it can hold 6.5 million cubic feet of gas. Its top speed is 84 miles per hour, and it can fly 10,580 miles in one go.</p>
<p>Follow-up: According to a wireless telegram from the German oil tanker Forbes, the first officer and three crew members of the Akron airship have been rescued, and they are still moored nearby to rescue the remaining people.</p>
<p>Follow-up: Among those on board the Akron airship were Rear Admiral Moffett, Director of the Bureau of Aeronautics of the Navy Department, and several commanders of the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. In addition, there were 19 other officers. As of now, in addition to the four people rescued by the German oil tanker, there have been no further reports of survivors. Four coast guard vessels, a cruiser, a destroyer, and many other types of ships in the vicinity are rushing to the rescue. Washington has received a phone call from Lakehurst stating that the chances of survival for the remaining people are very slim. Due to poor weather conditions and poor visibility, reconnaissance aircraft cannot be dispatched to investigate. Although the Akron is still floating near the Barnegat lightship, it is feared that it has been completely destroyed. This morning, a wireless telegram was received here from the German ship Forbes stating that they are currently engaged in searching for survivors. Last night at 10:00 p.m., the Akron was still sending wireless telegrams, but due to thunderstorms, communication could not be continued.</p>
<p>Follow-up: According to the captain of the German ship Forbes, he saw an aircraft pass by in the thunderstorm, and then saw lights flashing on the water surface, and heard many people shouting for help. He immediately turned on all the lights on the ship and lowered the lifeboats to rescue the people, but only rescued three people, and witnessed the rest sinking before the lifeboats arrived. Judging from various signs, most of the people must have drowned.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 3rd - The U.S. Navy airship Akron suddenly crashed into the ocean 22 miles outside the Barnegat Lighthouse tonight. Of the 19 officers and 57 soldiers on board, only three have been rescued so far, and only two have survived. Wireless operator Cobran died of serious injuries. It can truly be called the second major tragedy involving an American airship, and also the second incident since the Akron was completed. As for the cause of the disaster, it is still unknown. However, not long before the accident, at 1:04 a.m., the Lakehurst Navy Department office received the last telegram, stating that they were flying along the New England coast and everything was normal. Unexpectedly, at 2:30 a.m., a wireless message was received from the German oil tanker Forbes, reporting that the airship had crashed and was drifting on the ocean surface, and only three people had been rescued. They are currently patrolling the nearby waters. However, the Barnegat Lighthouse is in New Jersey, only 70 miles from New York. Navy Department personnel initially did not believe that the Akron could have crashed there. However, as telegrams from the Coast Guard and various shipping companies poured in, Navy Department personnel began to believe it. At that time, the Barnegat lifeboat station had already dispatched lifeboats to the scene of the accident. When the sky began to lighten, two Navy destroyers also arrived at the scene, and the lifeboat station also sent doctors and nurses to provide medical assistance. However, after the German ship discovered the ship, it encountered a major thunderstorm, greatly hindering rescue efforts. By the time it dawned, the airship had drifted 30 miles outside the lighthouse. The most famous of the missing personnel on board include the Director of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Moffett; the airship commander, Macgote; the commander of the Lakehurst airship station, Bray; and Bureau of Aeronautics member, Shet. This airship departed from Lakehurst on Sunday night, and unexpectedly encountered this tragic disaster. The United States has only built four large airships: the Shenandoah, the Los Angeles, the Akron, and the Macon. The Shenandoah was destroyed in a thunderstorm in 1925, and the Los Angeles was also decommissioned last year.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - The Navy Department reported to President Roosevelt today that the Akron airship encountered a storm and probably caught fire due to electrocution, resulting in the accident. The German oil tanker Forbes and two steamships are still searching for the missing crew members at the site of the Akron's accident.</p>

<p>Government Will Ask Parliament for Authorization to Restrict Russian Imports</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd - Reuters learned tonight that the new bill against Russia that the British government intends to submit to the House of Commons authorizes the Minister of Commerce to issue orders to ban certain Russian goods or completely prohibit their import. The government is currently consulting with overseas autonomous territories on this matter. Today, British Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons that the anti-Russian bill, drafted after the Soviet Union detained six British engineers from Vickers Electrical Company, will be submitted to the House of Commons tomorrow and must be fully passed by Wednesday. Although the British Prime Minister made this statement, he did not want to elaborate on the detention of British engineers by the Soviet Union. Labor Party Länsbury repeatedly questioned, wanting to understand the current situation before considering the bill. However, the British Prime Minister replied that it would not be appropriate to publish the content of his talks while the British Ambassador and the Russian Foreign Minister were negotiating a new trade agreement to replace the one expiring on April 17. Länsbury also asked whether the anti-Russian bill was proposed because the Soviet Union had detained British engineers. The British Prime Minister said that making such remarks today would not be to the benefit of those arrested, but he would make a statement tomorrow or Wednesday when discussing the bill.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 4th - The government has decided to publish a white paper tomorrow regarding the Moscow incident (i.e., the Soviet government's arrest of British engineers). This move can be seen as an acknowledgment of the opposition party's request, as the opposition party had requested that the Moscow incident be brought up for discussion before the second reading of the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement Bill.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - The original text of the Russian goods import ban bill submitted by the government to the House of Commons has been published today. This bill will be passed twice tomorrow. The bill authorizes the government to prohibit the import of various goods produced within Soviet Russia by order.</p>

<p>Russian Citizens Abused in Germany</p>
<p>Homes of Russian Merchants Searched</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 3rd - Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov today lodged a strong protest with the German Minister to Moscow regarding the illegal arrests and abuse of Soviet Russian people in Germany. At the same time, a protest was lodged against the German search of the residences of Soviet Russian commercial representatives.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 3rd - The Soviet Russian government newspaper Izvestia criticized Germany's anti-Soviet Russian measures, saying that Germany's policy towards Soviet Russia is a provocative policy, and clearly pointed out the various unreasonable arrests and searches carried out by Germany against Soviet Russian people. The newspaper also said that German Chancellor Hitler had declared a friendly policy towards Soviet Russia, but Hitler appointed Rosenberg as a special commissioner for internal affairs, which shows that the words of friendship are all false, because Rosenberg's opposition to Soviet Russia and his plan to separate the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic from Soviet Russia are well known.</p>

This afternoon, US representative Davis also consulted with the British Prime Minister on this matter for a long time. Davis is scheduled to depart for Paris tomorrow to consult with the French government, and will probably go to Berlin afterward. At the same time, British Foreign Minister Simon is now soliciting the opinions of the organizing committee in order to find a way to convene the economic conference.</p>
<p>US House of Representatives Passes Bill Prohibiting Disclosure of Diplomatic Secrets</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 3rd - Today, the House of Representatives, at the request of the US President, passed a bill by a vote of 299 to 29 to prevent people from obtaining foreign secret codes, which would make it difficult for the government in diplomatic affairs. The bill prohibits people from publishing government secret documents that may harm national security and interests. Violators will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to ten years or fined $10,000. The introduction of this bill was completely unexpected even by the members of Congress, which can be said to be extremely abrupt. There is obviously a reason behind the scenes that it had to be passed quickly, but it was not explicitly stated. Afterwards, some people outside pointed out that this bill is tantamount to gagging the press. The State Department immediately issued a statement saying that this bill is to protect American diplomatic telegram codes and does not intend to silence the press or impose censorship.</p>

<p>Severe Penalties for Spreading Communism</p>
<p>Opening Up Gambling Ban to Increase Revenue</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 3rd - Today, the King of Siam issued an edict to eradicate communism in Siam. The edict stated that communism is sufficient to endanger the country. Hereafter, anyone who promotes communism shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to ten years or fined up to £450. Employees of communist societies shall also be subject to the same punishment, and members shall be subject to imprisonment for up to five years or fined £90. Bangkok is tranquil today, but foreign embassies are protected by troops to prevent disturbances. Reuters, Singapore, 4th - According to news from Bangkok, the Siamese authorities are now making every effort to increase national revenue. A man named Dai Dirong (transliteration), who previously made contributions to the Siamese government and was awarded a medal by the Siamese King, was very influential in the gambling industry before Siam banned gambling several years ago. Now, Dai has submitted a request to the Siamese government, willing to contract lotteries, reporting an annual contribution of approximately 5 million Siamese baht. This matter is currently under serious consideration by the Siamese authorities. When Dai was asked about this matter, he said that the government may entrust him with handling this lottery. Since the government has allowed gambling that is not beneficial to the country and the people, such as horse racing and card games, and the national treasury has been declining in the past three years, this gambling ban can be opened up to increase revenue. It is heard that lotteries are expected to be revived within this month, with a term of five years. Whether to continue after the term expires will be decided by the government.</p>

<p>(Enemy's General Offensive) Due to the failure of the Japanese Kwantung Army's attack on Xifengkou and Luowenyu, the Japanese High Command, in order to threaten the garrisons at various passes of the Great Wall, mobilized Japanese troops stationed in the three provinces of Huan, Ji, and Hei on the 21st of last month and moved them to Suizhong in western Liaoning for concentration. Troops opened up along the Datong Road and entered the puppet Fengshan Railway, totaling more than a dozen trains, most of which were remnants of the Matsuki 14th Division from the Angxi and Eastern China Railway areas. The Japanese troops concentrated in Suizhong moved to Qian'an on the 30th. After all disembarking, they marched on foot to Jiumenkou, joining forces with the "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army" of Li Jichun, organized by puppet troops. On the afternoon of the 30th, several dozen enemy scouts and reconnaissance cavalry were discovered at Xiangshui, Jiumenkou, by our defending Wang Brigade [illegible] Regiment. Both sides exchanged fire with rifles. At 6:00 a.m. on the 31st, more than 300 Japanese troops suddenly launched an attack on us, and more than 20 new-style armored vehicles advanced fiercely towards Shahe. Due to our weak forces, we voluntarily withdrew to [illegible]. After suddenly crossing Shahezai at 11:00 a.m. on the 31st, the enemy increased its main force, totaling about 6,000 troops, taking a large encirclement formation against our Shimenzhai. More than 20 enemy aircraft also provided cover for explosions at 4:00 p.m. Our army stood firm. In the evening, the enemy changed to using artillery to bombard fiercely, turning the east of the Shi River line into a red glow. The battle was even more intense than the battle of Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>(Fierce Day-Long Battle) At 11:00 p.m. on the 31st, our army launched a counterattack on Shahezai, but failed. At dawn yesterday (the 1st), a unit of our army concentrated in the Liangjiashan area. At 10:00 a.m., the enemy again increased its reinforcements from Jiumenkou and launched another fierce attack on our Shimenzhai. [Illegible] Army Commander Yao Dongfan personally supervised the battle in a certain area. Battles also broke out on the east bank of the Shi River at 4:00 p.m. More than a dozen enemy aircraft flew to Shimenzhai, Shihetao, Liangjiashan, and other places to bomb. Infantry and cavalry on the front also launched a joint fierce attack. Our army, based on the two highlands northwest and southwest of Shimenzhai, gave a head-on blow. The situation was very tense, with casualties on both sides reaching more than 1,000. Currently, our army in the Shahezai area has established new contact with follow-up troops, and is firmly defending Shimenzhai while bravely resisting. At 10:15 yesterday morning, when the No. 102 express train on the Beining Railway arrived in Ping, more than 30 wounded soldiers who had fought in Shimenzhai came with it. This reporter met a wounded soldier at the station, who said that the battle in Shimenzhai was extremely fierce last night (i.e., the night before), and the sound of gunfire was heard in Qinhuangdao, indicating a very serious situation. As of 2:00 p.m. yesterday, fierce battles were still ongoing near Shimenzhai.</p>
<p>(He [illegible] Shang Meeting) Army Commander He Guizhen of the [illegible] Army received a report of the outbreak of fighting in Shimenzhai on the afternoon of the [31st] and immediately went to the military branch to meet with He Yingqin to ask for instructions. He then left Ping on a special train at 0:50 a.m. on the 1st and arrived at [illegible] County at 10:00 a.m., intending to personally go to a certain area in the front to supervise the troops. Commander Shang Zhen of the [illegible] Army Corps also arrived at a certain area from the Lengkou front line on the evening of the 31st due to the outbreak of major battles in Shimenzhai, and met with He Zhuguo, Gao Guizhen, and others. He Guozhen sent two telegrams to Ping on the 1st, reporting the battle situation on the front. Telegram 1: (1) The enemy attacking our Shimenzhai is indeed more than 4,000 Japanese troops, the vanguard of which is 2,000 puppet troops under Li Jichun, with more than 20 tanks. Since noon yesterday (the 31st), they have repeatedly launched fierce attacks on our positions, all of which have been bravely repelled by our army. However, the enemy is extremely tenacious, and is still fighting fiercely when the telegram was sent. (2) 24 enemy aircraft have been wantonly bombing our positions in the Shimenzhai area from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. yesterday (the 31st), causing many casualties to our army. However, the enemy has also suffered many casualties as they have been repeatedly repelled by us. (3) The attacking enemy is all wearing yellow wool uniforms, red-rimmed hats, and planting the Qing Tian Bai Ri flag, clearly a mixed force of Japanese and puppet troops, but when questioning the Japanese side, they evade responsibility by claiming that they are the "National Salvation Anti-Japanese Army." Telegram 2: At 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the 31st, about 200 enemies of the combined Japanese-puppet infantry, artillery, and air forces pressed on our sentries at Xiangshui. At 7:00 a.m., about 2,000 enemy reinforcements began a fierce attack on our Shahezai garrison. After fierce fighting between the two sides until 10:00 a.m., our army, under pressure from the superior enemy, withdrew to the [illegible] area. Fierce battles were still ongoing at noon on the 31st.</p>
<p>(Enemy Bombs Qinhuangdao) According to transportation circles, the battle situation in Shimenzhai was extremely fierce both the day before yesterday and yesterday. The armored train of the enemy army stationed in Shanhaiguan opened fire to show off its power at Shihe yesterday morning, and the sound of heavy artillery was also heard in Qinhuangdao. At 10:20 a.m., three enemy aircraft circled from Haiyangzhen to Qinhuangdao and dropped bombs. Our communication facilities were thus disrupted. Four enemy warships sailed into Qinhuangdao from Xie Liang Kou at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. Motor vehicles on the Beining Railway continued to depart yesterday morning. After 2:00 p.m. yesterday, details are unknown due to telephone disruptions in Qinhuangdao. (April 2nd)</p>

<p>Japanese Warships Being Redeployed Along the North China Coast</p>
<p>Shen Honglie Summoned to Nanjing by Telegram from Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Japanese warships along the North China coast, belonging to the Second Overseas Dispatch Fleet, have their headquarters traditionally located in Qingdao. The commander, Tsuda, is stationed in Qingdao. Originally, the fleet consisted of three small destroyers and four cruisers, patrolling Qingdao, Yantai, Longkou, Dagu, Qinhuangdao, Lushun, and other ports. After the Rehe Incident, four additional destroyers were suddenly added, which already attracted considerable attention. Recently, the headquarters suddenly moved from Qingdao to Lushun. The flagship Hirado, carrying Commander Tsuda, left Qingdao for Lushun today (the 2nd). Tsuda himself is scheduled to travel by destroyer from Qingdao to Lushun on the 4th. While the intent of this move is unknown, it is certain that Lushun is a key Japanese port, and the relocation of the fleet headquarters there has military implications. According to a telegram from an unspecified source today, the disposition of Japanese warships is as follows: two new warships have arrived in Qingdao from Yantai; the Izumo and Tokiwa (old cruiser) are stationed in Yantai, Longkou, and Weihai; the Wakamiya seaplane tender/oiler and the Tama cruiser, along with one destroyer, are stationed in Qinhuangdao; and four destroyers and the flagship Hirado are stationed in Lushun. Our country's naval commander in Qingdao, Shen Honglie, received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday summoning him to Nanjing. This morning (the 2nd) at 7:40 a.m., Shen arrived in Jinan. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, met with Shen at the Jiaoji Hotel to discuss matters related to the joint defense of the province's coast and land. According to Shen, his trip to Nanjing will involve separate meetings with Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei to report on the province's coastal defense and Qingdao's municipal affairs, as well as to seek instructions on everything. He expects to return in about four or five days. Shen then changed to the Jinpu Railway train heading south. (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Zhang Ji Discusses Fundamental National Salvation Policies <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Armed Resistance and Economic Severance as Key Strategies for Resisting Aggression</p>
<p>Unity of the People Requires Eradication of Bureaucratic and Warlord Politics</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Zhang Ji, Chairman of the Central North China Office, returned to Beijing from Xinxiang the morning before yesterday (the 3rd) at 8:00 a.m. Yesterday, a reporter from the Nichinichi Shimbun visited Zhang at his residence to inquire about the recent situation in North China and the fundamental policies for national salvation. He was received and gave a detailed account. The most important points are summarized below: Zhang said that the invading Japanese army is currently advancing from western Rehe towards the eastern border of Chahar, intending to gradually encroach upon the key areas of Chahar and Suiyuan in Inner Mongolia, bringing all the territory outside the Great Wall under its control, and then looking southward towards Tianjin and Beijing, invading the interior. Their plan is cunning and their intention is malicious. Although we have strengthened defenses in eastern Chahar, the future depends on the determination of the frontline soldiers and the entire nation to resist unanimously. According to news he has received, there have been no major battles at the passes along the Great Wall recently. Any contacts are merely attempts by the Japanese army to restrain our rear, as their primary objective is currently Chahar and Suiyuan.</p>
<p>Whether or not the North China Office will be relocated has not yet been concretely decided. His intention in establishing this office was to fulfill a fundamentally important mission, but the effectiveness depends on whether it has the power to execute its duties. If it can fulfill its tasks and avoid any difficulties, the office could be relocated from Xinxiang to Baoding, or even to the front lines. However, if relocation fails to resolve difficulties and produce results, it would be futile. As the national crisis is severe, the military, especially the North China military, should unanimously go to the front lines to kill the enemy and defend the country. But what if some soldiers are unwilling to go to the front lines? Furthermore, it is urgent for the people to organize themselves and use self-defense forces to resist the enemy. But what if local soldiers, fearing that the people's self-defense organizations might turn against them, forbid them from self-defense? Moreover, boycotting enemy goods is one way to economically restrain the enemy, but what if warlords and bureaucrats protect enemy goods and suppress the people's boycott movement? These are all important questions that deserve attention.</p>
<p>Regarding the way to save the nation and resist aggression, two things are most necessary and effective: (1) armed resistance and (2) economic severance. If military force and economic measures are pursued in parallel, they will certainly yield considerable results. This can be asserted with certainty. The enemy's aggression against our country also involves military force and economic measures. Japan's occupation of the Three Eastern Provinces and Rehe involved the use of cannons and machine guns to kill our people—military aggression. The dumping policy of enemy goods floods China, leaving no room for the development of domestic goods—economic aggression. To prescribe the right medicine for the ailment, national salvation and resisting aggression require only armed resistance and economic severance. However, the implementation of these requires, on one hand, that the military and the people unite and fight the enemy, and on the other hand, that the government and the people communicate as one to boycott enemy goods. To ensure smooth progress without difficulties, it is first necessary to eliminate bureaucratic and warlord politics. Otherwise, bureaucratic corruption and abuse of power will obstruct the boycott of enemy goods, and warlords will maintain their armies for self-defense, refusing to go to the front lines to resist the enemy and even preventing the people from defending themselves, all of which will affect national salvation and resisting aggression. He will soon present these matters to the central government, which should promptly discuss them. Conversely, empty talk of saving the nation without addressing the fundamentals will achieve nothing. In the four northeastern provinces, there are over three million people, including 540,000 able-bodied men. It is clear that there are many able-bodied men nationwide who can take up arms to defend the country, but they are not yet united.</p>
<p>Regarding the opening of political power, his intention is that political power should be exercised freely throughout the country. Currently, our country does not lack political power, but the inability of political power to flow freely is a major problem. If political power is handed over to those who can exercise it to achieve national salvation, then opening it up is acceptable. But if it is only nominal and does not help in reality, then opening up is the same as not opening up. He recalled that during the European War in 1914, when he traveled to France and Germany, France, with a population of 50 million, had over two million dead and wounded, but the people continued to go to the battlefield. Germany, with a population of 70 million, had about three million dead and wounded, but the people also continued to fight on the battlefield. Although our national crisis is severe, how many have died and been wounded? This shows the people's concept of national crisis. He recalled that in 1920 in Berlin, Germany, while staying at a hotel, he had to obtain meal tickets from the government to purchase food, demonstrating such centralized control of food supplies. Furthermore, the Rhine River was guarded by troops from various countries, but German children still traveled back and forth on the river in small boats, singing the national anthem. If a foreign soldier, drunk and walking on the road, bumped into a German, the German would slap him in the face and knock him down. The middle of the road was full of foreign soldiers, but several Germans would walk hand in hand in the middle of the road, singing German songs, and the foreign soldiers could do nothing. Compared to our country, what is the level of patriotism in Germany? In short, our revolution has not yet succeeded, and all comrades must work together and strive forward to save the nation."

<h3 id="e80">Monk Masterminds Robbery Case <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The home of Ye Zhizhong of the Ye family in Heiqiao, Songjiang was robbed in broad daylight. Two robbers, Zhang Fuxing and Yang Zhengming, were apprehended in a car on the same day, and stolen goods worth 370 yuan were seized. The case has been reported. It is now known that Zhang Fuxing is a monk named Long Wu in disguise, who previously served as a guest monk at the Xilin Temple in the city. He regularly associated with retired soldiers, privately traded opium, had illicit relations with women, and engaged in illegal activities such as salt smuggling. After the abbot heard rumors of these activities, he was expelled in mid-January and went wandering. The Ye family robbery was planned after the monk performed Buddhist services at the Ye residence and became familiar with its contents. He recently learned that the Ye family had sold unpolished rice for 600 yuan, and then contacted the robbers to carry out the robbery. A monk committing robbery should serve as a warning to superstitious families.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 2nd, around 1 a.m., more than ten bandits armed with two guns broke into the home of He, a farmer from Nianwujiadai, south of Xiuye Bridge in the western suburbs, and began ransacking the house. When a neighbor, Ma Ahu, saw this, he shouted loudly to catch the thieves. The bandit on guard struck Ma's right leg with an iron ruler, causing him to fall in extreme pain. The gang then robbed Ma Ahu's daughter-in-law, Xiu Juan, of her earrings and two to three hundred yuan in cash, and fled with a shout. Ma Ahu's leg bone was broken by the blow, and he is currently receiving medical treatment for the injury.</p>

<p>Sun Liansheng, a native of Nantong, was 30 years old. In 1930, he and his adoptive father, Sun Laowu, lived on Jiangwan Road in Shanghai. Because Liansheng idled away his days, Laowu scolded him. On the night of July 27th of that year, he colluded with his fellow villagers Ji Shuangquan, Qiu Shuntao, and Qiu Lansheng to drag Laowu from his bed and kill him. After the case was discovered, the Shanghai court sentenced him to death. He appealed to the Jiangsu High Court and the Supreme Court, both of which upheld the death sentence. Yesterday (the 4th), the High Court Prosecutor's Office received a telegram from the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordering the execution of Liansheng by hanging at the Third Branch Prison execution grounds on Siqian Street.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Three Legal Associations Strive for Repayment of Grain Loan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Suzhou Finance Department's long-standing pre-borrowing of winter grain, the gentry of Wu County telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the province be ordered to repay the loan to alleviate the suffering of the people of Suzhou. The Ministry of Finance approved the request and ordered the province to repay. However, the provincial government, citing the exhaustion of the provincial treasury, decided to postpone repayment for another year and reported this to the Ministry of Finance. The three legal associations of agriculture, commerce, and education in Suzhou, believing that the Suzhou provincial authorities were violating the Ministry's order and disregarding the people's hardships, jointly submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday (the 4th), requesting that the Suzhou provincial government's report be rejected and that the Suzhou provincial government be ordered to repay the loan as soon as possible to uphold the laws of the central government and alleviate the people's suffering.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Call for Taxation of Oil Refining <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The self-refining kerosene industry in Wuxi is an emerging enterprise. In the summer of last year, there were only one or two factories, which, with simple equipment, were highly profitable. As a result, many people imitated them. Within half a year, the number of factories rose to more than 120. Neighboring counties such as Suzhou, Changzhou, Changshu, and Jiangyin also saw factories spring up like bamboo shoots after rain. As a result, the raw material for refining kerosene, salao oil, could not meet the demand, and the price soared to over 120 yuan per ton. Eventually, with the dumping of foreign oil and falling oil prices, the self-refining oil industry declined. Many factories closed down. Currently, there are fewer than ten factories operating normally. The Jiangsu Finance Department, seeing that the flourishing self-refining kerosene industry in various counties in the province was hindering national tax revenue, specially appointed Ding Naicheng as the Director of the Jiangsu Province Oil Refining Business Tax Collection Bureau. According to the fourth provision of the Business Tax Law, a tax of 10% is levied on net income. Director Ding, upon receiving the order, established offices in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Jiangyin, and Changshu. Because Wuxi was the earliest and had the most factories, it was decided to start with Wuxi. A new method was also devised, stipulating that a tax of one yuan was levied for each tin of refined oil, and contacts were made with the factories separately. The factories argued that costs were high, sales were sluggish, and there was no net income to speak of, but the bureau suddenly levied one yuan, with no basis for doing so. Therefore, they strongly opposed it. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be forwarded to the Provincial Department and the Ministry of Finance and Industry, asking for relief to alleviate the hardships of businesses.</p>

<p>(Director Pan's Address) Education Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan said in his speech: "Today we commemorate Children's Day to save the country and the nation. This is your future hope and also your responsibility. We are happily here today, but you must think about the compatriots in the Three Northeastern Provinces, who are almost like slaves to a foreign power, and whose basic needs for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation are hardly met. There is a world of difference between them and you. How can we make them live like us? Simply put, it all depends on you children: (1) to cultivate yourselves and (2) to bear the great responsibility of saving the nation."</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: There have been rumors in Shanghai for days that Chiang Kai-shek would go north within days, or would go to Jiangxi before going north. To verify this, the reporter visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government, who informed them that the Municipal Government had received news from Nanjing that the Communist bandits in Jiangxi were attempting a final act of defiance while the Nationalist troops were resisting Japan on the front lines. To address both the front and the rear, Chiang Kai-shek went to Jiangxi before heading north to make some arrangements and instruct the troops on the suppression of the bandits, and then headed north from Wuhan. He departed for Jiangxi yesterday (the 4th).</p>

<p>First to Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi</p>
<p>Then to Key Ports in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>General Zhang Zhijiang, Councilor of the Military Council and Director of the Central Guoshu (National Martial Arts) Institute, has recently received telegrams from guoshu organizations in Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and various ports in Southeast Asia, requesting him to provide guidance. Zhang believes that guoshu has shown</p>
<h3 id="e90">Special Effectiveness <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>In the Battle of Shanghai and the defense of Xifengkou.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the southwest provinces and overseas Chinese in promoting it is admirable. He agreed to their requests and, the day before yesterday, personally led the secretary of the Central Guoshu Institute, Li Wenbo, and male and female members of the institute, Li Yuanzhi and others, with hundreds of weapons such as knives, spears, swords, and halberds, from Nanjing to Shanghai. Yesterday at noon, they left Shanghai aboard the Wanshang ship and headed south. Many representatives from various circles went to see them off. The reporter from the Shin Shih News Agency interviewed Zhang on board the ship, who told them that the main purpose of this trip was that with the national crisis deepening and foreign insults becoming more urgent, if the Chinese people did not rise up to defend themselves, the tragedy of national subjugation and racial extinction would befall us. As for methods of self-defense,</p>

<p>Is the primary means, because both men and women, young and old, can engage in training, and its effect is significant and widespread. The purpose of this trip is to promote guoshu to prepare the Chinese people to face the national crisis. He plans to first go to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Guilin, and other places, and then go to various ports in Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines, Singapore, Java, Manila, to inspect and guide the guoshu organizations established by local governments and the public, and the guoshu groups established by overseas Chinese, so as to promote it. He will also promote the Ten-Man Christian Patriots' Group everywhere.</p>

<p>The Japanese Policy of Appeasement Will Make It More Difficult</p>
<p>The Country Is Broken and the Home Is Destroyed, Leaving No Choice but to Fight to the End</p>
<p>Liang Jingzhai, Commander-in-Chief of the Heilongjiang Provincial National Salvation Army, came to Shanghai a few weeks ago and made contacts with various circles in Nanjing and Shanghai. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited him at his residence. According to Liang, the Japanese have gradually implemented a policy of appeasement in the Three Northeastern Provinces, and the people's spirit is gradually declining, which will make it more difficult. The government advocates long-term resistance, but it must make plans to recover the lost territory in the short term, otherwise, merely resisting will not easily restore the Northeast. The anti-Japanese soldiers in the Northeast have lost their country and homes, leaving no choice but to fight to the end, regardless of the government's policies, otherwise, there will be no way out. Liang is a prominent figure in Heilongjiang Province and is very wealthy. In addition to donating funds to organize the provincial militia into the National Salvation Army, the rest of his property has been confiscated by the Japanese puppet regime.</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association recently decided to allocate 10,000 yuan to General Zhu Ziqiao to take to the front lines and allocate another 10,000 yuan to purchase heavy-duty trucks for transportation.

<h3 id="e94">Police Chief Resigns to Go North to Kill the Enemy <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Fu Yiming Volunteers for the Front Lines</p>
<p>Fu Yiming, a police chief in this city, requested a long leave from his superiors yesterday, intending to join the army in the north. His original petition is as follows: "Petition for approval of a long leave to go north to kill the enemy and fulfill a long-held aspiration, as the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. I, the police chief, believe that the Japanese invaders disregard international law, undermine human peace, and act against the greater good, relying on their military power to forcibly occupy our Northeastern Provinces and massacre our compatriots. Recently, their ambitions have not waned, as they have invaded Rehe and are now plotting to invade Chahar, taking an inch and seeking a mile, seeking to annex our China. At this time of crisis, when the country is on the verge of destruction, none but the heartless would fail to share the same hatred. Therefore, people throughout the country are grieving over the imminent loss of their country and have awakened and are determined to save the country. Those with wealth are raising funds and contributing them to supply the soldiers at the front. Those without wealth are joining the army, sacrificing their lives to kill the enemy. I, the police chief, am a soldier and cannot help but hate the sight of the imminent tragedy of national subjugation. I know that my strength is weak, but my patriotic zeal is no less than that of others. I recently received a letter from a friend from Nanjing, saying that there are organizations of patriotic groups in Nanjing that will allow anyone willing to go to the front to kill the enemy to register and join. I, the police chief, believe that it is a rare opportunity to sacrifice myself for the country. I urge you to approve a long leave, taking national considerations as the most important thing, so that I may travel north with them and wield my weapon to kill the enemy and fulfill my aspiration. Whether it is appropriate to approve the long leave to go north to kill the enemy is hereby respectfully submitted to you for your consideration and instruction. Respectfully submitted by Police Chief Fu Yiming, Submitted by the patrol officer to the station chief."</p>

<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that Lee Chun-san, a Korean revolutionary leader (who has become a Chinese citizen) who was kidnapped on Luban Road in the city, has been missing for nearly a month. At that time, the Shanghai Bar Association and the Chinese League for Civil Rights issued a declaration, petitioning our authorities to investigate the matter and determine whether it was the work of the Japanese, in order to lodge a protest. But a week later, the case disappeared without a trace. According to a report in yesterday's British-owned North China Daily News, Lee Chun-san was arrested in the French Concession by police from the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai and was recently deported back to Korea aboard a Japanese ship to be charged with undermining the Japanese Empire.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Statement by Mr. Backes, Representative of United Aviation Corporation <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Acquisition of China Aviation Stock</p>
<p>Dedicated to Commercial Aviation</p>
<p>No Government Affiliation</p>
<p>Mainland newspapers report that since United Aviation Corporation acquired 41% of the stock of China Aviation Corporation, well-informed sources in this port have generally expected great development in China's domestic aviation industry. However, when representatives from United Aviation Corporation, including Mr. Backes, were questioned yesterday about a preliminary expansion plan, they declined to comment. Mr. Backes did acknowledge that one of the company's primary objectives is to establish a trans-Pacific air route. However, he noted that there are still many technical and other difficulties that need to be resolved before this can be achieved in the short term. For example, establishing such a route would require the cooperation of Japan or Soviet Russia, but the United States has not yet recognized Soviet Russia. Furthermore, no existing aircraft can reliably operate regular flights across the Pacific. Mr. Backes arrived in Shanghai a month ago, stayed for a few days, and then went to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. He has now returned to Shanghai from the South for another short stay. Recently, there have been widespread rumors that United Aviation Corporation's involvement in the Far East is related to the U.S. government, as the United States supposedly wants to establish aviation bases in the Pacific in preparation for any potential contingencies in U.S.-Japan relations. However, when Mr. Backes was questioned about this yesterday, he firmly denied it, stating that United Aviation Corporation is a strictly non-governmental enterprise dedicated to commercial air transport. The only relationship it has with the government is through large-scale postal service contracts. The company currently operates air routes from the United States to Central America, then along the South American coast, eastward to the capital of Argentina and westward to the capital of Chile, handling passenger and mail transport and accelerating flights. This also allows the flight crews to become familiar with the sky and ground conditions of the areas they pass through. In particular, familiarity with the Panama Canal Zone is of great military importance to the United States, because in the event of war, it would be of great value to the government. However, this is only an incidental effect of United Aviation's system, and its primary purpose is transport. Regarding the promotion of aviation in China, he is not yet prepared to release concrete plans. Currently, China Aviation Corporation operates three routes: Shanghai-Hankou, Hankou-Chongqing, and Shanghai-Beiping. The Shanghai-Guangzhou route may also be opened soon. In addition, Mr. Backes spoke at length about the future of aviation, saying that its progress is very rapid, and it is almost impossible to predict today what is possible and impossible tomorrow. United Aviation Corporation is widely regarded as the largest airline in the United States, and its involvement in the Far East is a very important move. Currently, its only competitor in China is Germany's Lufthansa.</p>

<p>Boundless Anger Looking South at Our Nation</p>
<p>While Breath Remains, How Dare I Live in Ease</p>
<p>According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, General Ma Zhanshan, four months after retreating to Russia, recently wired Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of this city, from Russia, stating that he will be returning to China via Europe. He first dispatched his secretary, Du Xinwu, to Shanghai to deliver a personal letter to important figures. Mr. Du, accompanied by Wu Huanzhang, General Ma's representative, visited Mayor Wu yesterday morning to report. According to Mr. Du's statement to a Nichinichi Shimbun reporter, Chairman Ma, along with Generals Su Bingwen, Li Du, and Wang Delin, departed from Moscow and plan to stay briefly in Germany to study the situation there. If they do not go through Germany, they may return via the Mediterranean Sea. The original text of General Ma's letter to Mayor Wu is excerpted below: "Tiecheng, my esteemed brother: In the past, Zhanshan followed the orders of the central government, encouraged the military and civilians, and fought fiercely with the Japanese invaders. He believed that mutual support among the armies and quick battles were crucial strategies. Therefore, in November of last year, he led a contingent of troops to Zhalantun and Hailar to discuss military matters with Commander Su Bingwen and Brigade Commander Zhang Dianjiu. Unexpectedly, the plan failed, and they were trapped in dire straits. Subsequently, due to the sudden retreat of the army, they had no choice but to retreat into the Soviet Union together. However, upon retreating, he sent personnel to order the troops near Haiman to temporarily gather in separate groups towards Kailu and Zhanyu areas on the Rehe border. For the past three months, every time I remember the enemy invaders, I feel boundless anger looking south at our nation. While breath remains, how dare I live in ease? I am now returning to China via Europe and the West. The troops returning to China via Xinjiang are under the command of the responsible officers. The civilians, women, and children returning to China via Vladivostok are being properly cared for by Hulun County Magistrate Zhan Zhenhuan and Secretary Du Xinwu.

<h3 id="e108">Representatives of Fishermen and Merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Gathered Yesterday Regarding the Construction Fee Case <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Form a Committee to Oppose to the Death</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news that the Fisheries Improvement Committee was planning to implement a fisheries construction fee of two percent of the value of catches, the fishermen and merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, feeling deeply concerned, rose up in opposition. In addition to each fisherman and merchant separately telegraphing the central government to urge a halt, they held a temporary meeting at the Atlantic Restaurant on Fourth Malu yesterday. Over twenty representatives of fishermen and merchants, including Zhou Qianlin, Jin Jingbang, Feng Yikang, Zhu Shiyou, and Xu Jingshan, attended. Many important proposals were resolved, the main points of which are as follows: (1) China's fishing industry has declined to the extreme, and all fishermen and merchants find it difficult to bear any expenses. They unanimously insist on opposing the fisheries construction fee that will be levied soon. (2) A temporary "Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fishermen and Merchants Committee to Deny the Collection of Fisheries Construction Fee" will be organized to oppose it to the death, without stopping until the goal is achieved. (3) An appeal delegation will be organized, a declaration will be issued, and a division of labor will be determined.

<h3 id="e109">The Bureau of Public Works Investigation Report on the Zhengtai Rubber Factory Incident <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Poor Equipment of Various Rubber Factories</p>
<p>Measures to be Taken to Prevent Danger</p>
<p>On February 21st of this year, an explosion occurred at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory on Tangshan Road. The Bureau of Public Works ordered the relevant departments to investigate and report. The report was submitted to the board of directors on March 15th and has now been delivered to the Security Committee for detailed review in order to propose solutions. The main points of the report are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e110">Possible Causes of the Explosion <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The head of the Fire Department believes that the explosion and fire were both caused by a vulcanizer. The lid of the furnace was blown forty feet away. The explosion of the furnace was due to an electrical spark igniting a mixture of air and gasoline. The cause of the spark is unknown. The combustion of this mixed gas requires a temperature of 390 degrees Celsius. According to the statements of two witnesses, they first saw an electrical spark, and then the entire room was filled with flames. If the gasoline gas in the room reaches a certain concentration, it can be ignited by a spark. But in this case, the rupture of the furnace should be later. In short, whether the explosion originated inside or outside the furnace, preventive measures must be taken.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Research on the Properties of Gasoline <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The main danger of a rubber factory lies in the use of gasoline as a solvent. Commercially used gasoline contains about 23% light carbon compounds and can volatilize at 0 degrees Celsius. The factory usually has a temperature of 30 degrees, so the amount of volatilization is naturally higher. According to the test of the Health Department, the gasoline commonly used in Shanghai begins to boil at about 43 degrees, but combustion requires a temperature of 390 degrees. Electrical sparks can provide this high temperature. The combustion composition of gasoline needs to reach 1.6% to 5.3% in the air. If this degree has been reached, it is inevitable to explode when encountering sparks, or sparks from the collision of clocks and instruments, or uncovered lamps and candles.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Equipment Conditions of Various Rubber Factories <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to the investigation, there are 27 rubber factories in the Public Concession, employing about 3,000 workers. In 1927, there was only one, and the rest were opened in the last five years. Among these 27, 18 had submitted construction plans to the Public Works Department, 7 were converted from Chinese-style houses, and unapproved additions that could cause danger were found in 10. Those converted from thin Chinese-style houses have had their internal partitions removed, and the upper and lower floors are still connected by steep stairs, usually only two. Heavy machinery is installed downstairs, and many female workers work upstairs. Those with only one floor have workers working in the boiler room. The light is insufficient, and lights must be lit during the day, and the temperature inside the room is particularly high with few windows. Gasoline gas is heavier than air, and none of the rubber factories have ground ventilation equipment. In addition, there are many concerns about the installation of electrical appliances, the storage and use of gasoline, and other dangers to the life and health of workers.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Measures to be Taken to Prevent Danger (A) Regarding Building Construction: <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>1.  Before applying for a building permit for a rubber factory, the site should be approved in advance.</p>
<p>2.  The factory building must be specially constructed and fireproof. The gasification work room must be appropriately isolated.</p>
<p>3.  The room where most workers work shall not be located above a room where an explosion is possible.</p>
<p>4.  Existing factories that are unsuitable must be immediately renovated or moved.</p>
<p>**(B) Regarding Electrical Equipment:**</p>
<p>1.  All generators, switches, fuses, lamp holders, and other electrical equipment must have special installations where there is gasoline gas.</p>
<p>2.  The wiring must be arranged safely.</p>
<p>**(C) Regarding Preventing the Danger of Gasification:**</p>
<p>1.  This work room must be isolated.</p>
<p>2.  Before the rubber overshoes enter the vulcanizer, they should be placed in a ventilated drying room so that the gasoline gas in them can be dissipated.</p>
<p>3.  Do not allow iron to strike or grind, so as not to catch fire.</p>
<p>4.  The belts on the axles must be "endless" to avoid static electricity. The joints of the belts must be glued together and not connected with metal. The inside of the belt should be coated with pencil lead and rosin.</p>
<p>5.  Fresh air should be introduced from the high part of the room, and unclean air should be discharged from the ground by mechanical means. The generator that transports air should be located outside the room, and the electric fan should also be located outside or isolated. The discharged gas should be released to a height considerably above the roof.</p>
<p>6.  The gasoline used by workers should be placed in closable containers. Glass bottles must not be used. (Because pouring gasoline from glass bottles can generate electricity.)</p>
<p>7.  Wiping rags should be placed in a covered iron box and placed outside the room.</p>
<p>8.  The storage of large amounts of gasoline should be handled according to regulations. Those placed outside are only allowed to be sufficient for one day's use. When not needed, they should be placed in a special storage place outside the work room.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Other Dangers to be Noted <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the danger of explosion, when rolling crude rubber, it is necessary to add powders of lead and other compounds, which is harmful to the health of workers when inhaled. The inhalation of gasoline gas is also harmful and must have adequate ventilation equipment. Workers should wash their hands before meals. Eating is not allowed in any room where aluminum gasification work is done. Also, the grinding room is full of dust, which can also explode. Electrical equipment in it should also be paid attention to in the same way. In short, the factory building must be legal, all places must be clean, objects must not be discarded randomly, the worker exit must be sufficient and not blocked, and the toilet waste must have a suitable location. All of these must be inspected at any time before safety can be expected.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Ministry of Industry Replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce that Foreign Merchants Have No Patent Rights in China <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>There is No Restriction on Imitating Foreign Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from a Chinese factory stating that it intended to imitate foreign goods, with the same style and raw materials, and asked whether it was possible to imitate them. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce found that the "Provisional Regulations on Encouraging Industrial Technology" promulgated by the government order on September 30, 1932, stipulated that the right to enjoy patent rights for industrial articles or methods first invented is limited to citizens of the Republic of China. Foreign merchants with patented articles in their home country cannot prohibit Chinese merchants from imitating them within the territory of China. It specially requested the Ministry of Industry for an explanation. The Ministry of Industry replied: "I have received your telegram. As the Chinese Patent Law has not yet been formulated and promulgated, foreign merchants with patented articles in their home country naturally cannot enjoy patent rights within China. You should immediately inform them of this reply."</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Municipal Government Consulted the Ministry of Railways on How to Dispose of Land Enclosed for Two Roads <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>It Can Be Cancelled as Soon as a Reply is Received</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Railways' enclosure of civilian land for the construction of the Zhenru Joint Transportation Station has been opposed by the people of Pengpu District, as reported in previous newspapers. Considering the increasing difficulties, the authorities have decided to postpone the construction temporarily in order to concentrate on dealing with foreign affairs. As for the civilian land that was enclosed before, which was previously prohibited from being bought and sold, the Municipal Government stated that the enclosed civilian land was for the construction of the joint transportation station. Since this has been abandoned, it should be invalidated. It has now consulted the Ministry of Railways, and the notification to the local people on the cancellation of the land enclosure will be issued as soon as a reply is received in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Municipal Government Issued a Notice Prohibiting Foremen from Deducting Wages of Dock Workers <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>No Additional Exploitation to Eliminate Disputes</p>
<p>Dock workers in this city are suffering from extreme hardship due to the exploitation and deduction of wages by foremen. The dock affairs office specifically requested the municipal government to issue a notice to prohibit such practices in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers. The municipal government issued the following notice yesterday: "Notice is hereby given that, according to the report submitted by Zhang Jianbai, the standing commissioner of the Shanghai Dock Affairs Office, since the establishment of this office, there have been many cases reported to the office by dock workers regarding exploitation and deduction of wages by foremen. The reason for this is that during the national crisis, commerce has declined, and the loading and unloading of goods has decreased daily. Taking advantage of this decrease in goods and the surplus of workers, the foremen have not hesitated to hoard and deduct wages in order to maintain their previous income. The livelihood of workers is the most difficult for dock workers. In the past, when goods were crowded, the blood and sweat they earned every day were not enough to provide a meal. At a time when the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent and the people's livelihood is becoming more difficult, and when they are subjected to additional exploitation by foremen, their lives are even more unbearable. Their repeated reports to this office are a kind of urgent appeal by the workers themselves in a state of hunger and cold, and are not aimed at any hostility or difficulty towards the foremen. There are more than 80,000 dock workers. If the foremen are allowed to oppress and exploit them for a long time, the lives of the workers will be further plunged into a desperate situation. If this causes disputes and affects social security, it will be a matter of no small importance. Therefore, it is requested that your government issue a notice to all docks to strictly prohibit foremen from exploiting workers and deducting wages in order to maintain the lives of the workers and the security of this city, which is truly a public convenience. According to this, the livelihood of dock workers is the most difficult, which is the truth. If the foremen exploit and deduct wages, it is obviously inappropriate. According to the report, a notice must be issued urgently, ordering all dock foremen in the city to abide by it together. They must not exploit workers or deduct wages, so as to eliminate disputes. If anyone dares to violate this order, they will be severely punished according to the law. Wu Tiecheng, Mayor."</p>

<p>Requests Assistance from the Rice Grain Industry Association</p>
<p>Yan Shenyu, the magistrate of Shanghai County, has decided to hand over his duties today. Yesterday, Mr. Gu Xinyi of the Rice Grain Industry Association received a letter from Mr. Yan, stating that the grain storage matter handled during his term of office is related to the people's livelihood, and it is a pity that he could not see it completely. The text is as follows: (Omitted above) "Regarding the grain storage matter in our county, I previously received a generous donation of 5,000 yuan from your association, and later, you helped to order 2,000 shi of grain. Your public friendship and private feelings are deeply appreciated. Now, the site for our county's granary has been purchased, and the construction is about to begin as soon as the drawings are completed. It is expected that this grain fund can also be raised in sufficient amounts. I have now been ordered to be transferred to Xichang and will be handing over my duties soon, but I cannot remain indifferent to this important policy related to the people's livelihood, and I especially cannot forget your association's warm heart and lofty friendship. Therefore, I am writing to you again, hoping that you will continue to provide us with continuous assistance so that our county's grain storage undertaking can have a solid foundation, and the local area will benefit.

<p>Police Interference and Prevention</p>
<p>Lei Zaixi, the police chief of the Hejiajiao Police Station, Second Branch of the Sixth District of Xujiahui in western Shanghai, was patrolling Zhongshan Road yesterday morning around 10:00 AM when he spotted more than ten British soldiers in six cars parked by the roadside at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Zhongshan Road. The soldiers were surveying maps. Chief Lei, considering that the area belonged to the Chinese territory and involved sovereignty, advised them to stop working. The soldiers refused. Therefore, he took the driver, Cheng Afu, to the station. After a brief interrogation by Station Chief Wu, Cheng Afu confessed that he was 52 years old, a native of Shanghai, residing at No. 9 Metcalfe Road, and worked as a driver inside the British barracks on Daxi Road. The car number was 1448. At 8:30 AM this morning, he drove the car from the British military commander's house on the 13th floor to the British barracks at No. 63 Daxi Road, where more than ten soldiers boarded six cars and got off at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Hongqiao Road to draw maps. Station Chief Wu, based on the confession, ordered Cheng Afu to be temporarily detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Petition Against Wage Cuts</p>
<p>Factory Announcement Sets Five-Day Deadline for Resumption of Work</p>
<p>The Yiyuan Rubber Factory at No. 1002 North Chengdu Road in this city reduced workers' wages due to business reasons, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. The workers sent four representatives to negotiate, but they were dismissed. As a result, more than fifty workers in the galoshes department went on strike the day before yesterday. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, they sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. They were received by Tan Peiyan, a mediator from the Third Section, who promised to investigate and handle the matter. However, the factory, considering that the workers' strike affected business, issued an announcement yesterday setting a five-day deadline for the striking workers to report back to work, otherwise they would be considered to have resigned voluntarily.</p>

<p>Unable to Find a Friend After Crossing the Huangpu River, He Suddenly Wants to Commit Suicide</p>
<p>丨Now Under the Relief Efforts of the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau丨</p>
<p>Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, a young man wearing a student uniform of free cloth boarded a rowing boat at the Muddy Ferry Pier in Pudong to cross the Huangpu River. After the boat left the dock, the young man suddenly wanted to commit suicide by jumping into the river. Fortunately, the boatman noticed and stopped him before he went into the water. The boat then returned to Pudong, and the boatman handed him over to the police officer on duty to be taken to the Third District. After questioning by the district chief, the young man stated that his name was Jin Bo, 18 years old, from Shaoxing, residing in front of the Old Yue Temple in the city of his hometown. He had been studying in a private school in the city. His father's name was Xi En, 48 years old, working as a partner in a general merchandise store. His mother was 37 years old. Recently, his parents were secretly harmed by foreigners and fled, their whereabouts unknown. He had no siblings at home, and the house was rented, so it was difficult for him to stay alone. Therefore, he left home alone and came to Shanghai after much wandering. On the way, he heard that various counties were recruiting soldiers. He felt that the country was in danger and that it was time for him to join the army and serve the country. Therefore, he decided to register for military service in Shanghai County. However, after arriving in Shanghai for three days, his travel expenses were exhausted. He then remembered that his friend Chen Tianxi lived in Pudong, so he came to Pudong today to borrow a few silver dollars from Chen for pocket money. Unexpectedly, he searched everywhere but could not find him, and it was difficult to live if he went back, so he had the idea of ​​ending his life. The district chief also found a written petition to join the army on his person, which he had written himself. Although there were typos and incomprehensible sentences, the handwriting was quite elegant (the original text is recorded later). The district chief thought his ambition was commendable, so he ordered a document to be prepared and sent to the Second Section of the General Bureau for relief (Petition to Join the Army). Petition for Military Service: China, since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the enemy has invaded our territory, and the hatred has not ceased. They occupy our territory, take one step further, and are insatiable. Our army is numerous, but its strength is unequal to the enemy because its guns are not as good as the enemy's. Therefore, it is difficult to win. As a result, the violent Japanese bully us, Rehe has fallen, and North China is shaken. The evil forces are gradually endangering us. The hatred between us and Japan is deeply etched in our hearts. How can we, the youth, bear to sit and watch our country perish? We should fight to the death against the enemy. The people have long wanted to resist the enemy, but there is no way to volunteer. Now that we know that various provinces and counties are recruiting new soldiers, we cannot help but feel a surge of murderous intent. Therefore, we eagerly come to join the army and obey training, so that we can kill the enemy and fulfill our duty. We humbly ask the authorities to accept us, and we will be eternally grateful. Respectfully presented to the Shanghai County Magistrate (omitted below).</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, at No. 3 Pede North Lane, west of Yaojia Stone Bridge on Haichang Road in Zhabei, Shen Guigen (45 years old), a native of Taizhou who works as an opera singer, had a son named Hongbao, 24 years old, who earns a living by pulling a rickshaw. In the afternoon, he returned from outside and picked up a bomb that looked like an olive but was larger. Hongbao did not know what it was and took it to the front building. He first lit it with a match, but nothing happened. Then he lit it with an oil lamp. Unexpectedly, the bomb exploded from the heat. With a loud bang, Hongbao was injured and collapsed on the ground. Shrapnel was shot into his neck and legs. Hongbao's mother, Madam Shen (50 years old), was also hit in the face by shrapnel. His wife (20 years old) was injured in the right temple. A nine-year-old girl named Caixi, who lived upstairs in the same building and had the surname Hu, was injured in the top of her head. All of them had flesh and blood flying everywhere. The floor, the bed, and the tables and chairs were stained red. Later, they were sent to Pushan Hospital for treatment. The alley was covered in bloodstains, which was a terrible sight. Ma Zhenwu, the police officer on duty at Post No. 12 of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, also rushed to the scene after hearing the explosion. After inspecting the scene, he immediately reported to the Fourth District. Patrol officers and police chiefs were sent to investigate and confirm the facts. They reported back to District Chief Lai. Among the four injured, except for Hongbao, his mother, wife, and the nine-year-old girl upstairs had shrapnel removed by doctors, applied with good medicine, and bandaged up. However, Hongbao's injuries were more serious. Shrapnel was embedded deep in his neck and was not easy to remove at the time. After the doctors temporarily bandaged him, they instructed him to be transferred to Baolong Hospital, saying that his life might be in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Immoral Monk Arrested for Murder <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Such a Ferocious Disciple of Buddhism</p>
<p>Directly Admits Guilt in Court</p>
<p>The monk Nengjing, originally from Xinghua, Jiangbei, is now 41 years old. A woman from his hometown named Ouyang Liu, who was widowed at the age of 29, had an affair with the monk. From then on, they became illicitly acquainted and lived together in a kitchen at No. 68 Siwen Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha. The monk, being a lustful demon, did not chant scriptures but relied on begging for alms to make a living, causing Ouyang Liu to constantly feel that her income could not meet her expenses. A worker named Fan Weisheng, who did odd jobs, often went to her house to smoke opium, and they also became illicitly acquainted. Ouyang Liu also moved Fan into her room because Nengjing would often be away for several days when he went begging for alms, making it easier for them to share a bed and talk. On August 11 of last year, Nengjing returned and saw this situation, which aroused his jealousy. He questioned the woman. The woman, caught between the two men, worked hard to mediate. Seeing Nengjing's angry expression, she lied to him, saying that Fan was only renting a bed in the room, paying two yuan a month, which was a small but helpful supplement, and that the rent was paid in advance. Even if she wanted to evict him, she would have to wait until he had lived there for a month before dismissing him. The monk was deceived by the woman's words, and his anger subsided slightly, but his resentment was still difficult to quell. At 10:00 PM on the 14th, he secretly took a cow ear-shaped knife and went home. He saw the woman lying outside the room, while Fan was sleeping inside. The monk insisted that the woman enter the room and sleep with him, but the woman refused because of the hot weather. The monk then slept alone. At 3:15 AM the next morning, he suddenly had the urge to kill. In the dim light, he approached Fan's bed. Fan was fast asleep. The monk suddenly used the sharp knife to stab Fan in a vital spot. Fan woke up from his sleep in pain and shouted loudly. The woman was also awakened and entered the room. She saw Fan lying in a pool of blood. The monk was about to stab the woman with the knife, but she shouted for help, and he abandoned the knife and fled. Fan died several hours later. The police station reported the case to the First Special District District Court. The prosecutor examined the body, ordered it to be coffined and buried, and issued an arrest warrant to apprehend the murderer and punish him according to law. After half a year, Feng Baishun, a detective from the Putuo Road Police Station, learned that the monk had recently fled back to Shanghai and was still living with the woman at No. 9 Yongan Lane, Hengtong Road, Zhabei. He rushed there at 1:30 AM yesterday and arrested them both. They were then sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Qian Wenji conducted a preliminary hearing. After the police lawyer Chen Ming presented the case, he requested that the defendant Nengjing be prosecuted for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code. Ouyang Liu was asked to testify about the situation at the time and to confront the defendant's testimony. Nengjing confessed, "If I didn't kill Fan, Fan would definitely gather his gang and break my arms and legs. Liu told me this, so I killed him." Liu confessed, "Fan did say this." Judge Qian then ordered Ouyang Liu to be released and the defendant to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Big Fire in Jiangxinsha, Pudong <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Fuhai Left Fire in a Pile of Firewood</p>
<p>Burning More Than Twenty Thatched Houses</p>
<p>Jiangxinsha, also known as Caozhen, in Pudong, across the river from Wusong, has become increasingly prosperous since the Guanghua Oil Company set up a depot there, and the number of residents has increased. However, the majority are poor, so all the houses in the town are thatched. At 7:15 PM the night before last, a resident named Zhao Haifu, who worked on a lighter of the Junpu Bureau, left fire in a pile of firewood while having dinner, and it immediately ignited the roof. At the same time, the wind was very strong, causing the fire to spread uncontrollably, engulfing more than ten neighboring houses, including those of Zhao Hairong, Wei Bingrong, Chen Chuanlang, and Shabangbei, burning more than twenty thatched houses in total. Because there was no fire-fighting equipment, it was allowed to burn naturally until it was extinguished the next morning. The households affected by the fire were unable to save their belongings and suffered great losses. It is said that the municipal government is now planning to ban the thatched sheds to prevent fires.</p>
<p>Criminal Law 284 and requested that he be questioned. Ouyang Liu was asked to prove the circumstances at the time and to question the defendant's confession. I would certainly break my hands and feet if I did not kill Fan, but Fan would also gather his followers and break my hands and feet. This sentence was told by Liu, so I killed him, etc. Asked Liu to confess, Fan did indeed say this, Qian Tuishi then released Ouyang Liu and detained the defendant for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>Huang Yiyan Was Summoned to Court</p>
<p>Everything Was Inexplicable</p>
<p>Li Baowen, a native of Hangxian, is a promising young man who once worked as a translator for the Public Concession Police. He suffered from mental illness due to love stimulation some years ago and often became indignant. This time, he suddenly filed a complaint against the founders of the Charity Golden Bar Champagne, such as the well-known Mr. Bei and others, claiming in his statement to the District Court Prosecutor's Office that the founders had listed his name as one of the founders, so he wanted to recover 750,000 to supply the Northeast Volunteer Army, etc., and claimed that the witness to this matter was lawyer Huang Fuyan. After the court received the statement, it commissioned Prosecutor Yang to investigate. Not long after, lawyer Huang was summoned to the case inexplicably and met Li Baowen, who was his student eight years ago. His words were incoherent, and when he was called crazy, he looked angry and denied being mentally ill, and said that he would report the matter to the mayor. He was completely incoherent. Later, his mother arrived and proved that he was indeed sick, so the prosecutor briefly questioned him and ordered his mother to take him home.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Huamin Socks Factory Asks Taxpayers' Association to Protest Police Interference in Night Work <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Cui Zhenhua and Yu Dabao of Huamin Socks Factory on Binlang Road in western Shanghai yesterday asked the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association to protest the police interference in the factory's night work and machine noise case. The original letter is recorded below: Respectfully, we rent a house at No. 1027 Binlang Road to operate a sock weaving business. Unexpectedly, yesterday we received a summons from the First Special District District Court because we had been working the machines late at night from 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM every night in March this year, disturbing the sleep of residents, and the police had filed a lawsuit for violation of regulations. Upon learning this, we were shocked. We operate a legitimate business and pay taxes according to regulations. Due to business reasons, we have to work night shifts. Now the police of the Ding Department actually consider it a violation of regulations and file a criminal lawsuit, which is tantamount to depriving merchants of their livelihoods. We are one of the taxpayers in the Concession, and your association is an organization to protect the interests of Chinese taxpayers. Therefore, we dare to send this letter requesting your association's assistance and hope that you will protest based on the following two points: (1) Has the Ding Department divided the Concession area into factory areas and residential areas? (2) Has the Bureau of Works previously had a proposal to manage factories in the Concession, and has there been any result or agreement after consultation with the Chinese authorities? (3) Does operating night shifts in factories violate the Bureau of Works' police regulations? If the Bureau of Works has not yet designated which areas are factory areas and which areas are residential areas, and operating night shifts in factories does not violate the police regulations, then we are forced to work night shifts for business needs, and the Bureau of Works has no reason to file a lawsuit for violation of regulations. Furthermore, there are many factories set up by people of any nationality in the Concession that have night shifts, and we have never heard of the Bureau of Works filing a lawsuit for violation of regulations. Moreover, if we talk about disturbing the sleep of residents, then the vibration of heavy vehicles driving at night, the noise of car horns, or any other noise is enough to disturb people's sleep, and the Ding Department will probably consider all of them to be violations of regulations. In short, this matter concerns our small interests, but if this is used as a precedent, the losses to the Chinese merchant factories that work night shifts in the future will be unimaginable. Your association has always been committed to protecting the rights of taxpayers, so we hope you will uphold justice, protest to the Bureau of Works based on reason, and request the court to explain so as to avoid innocent people being forced. Not only will we be grateful, but the impact on all factories in Shanghai will be no small matter.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Citizens of Eastern Shanghai Refuse to Cut Off Water Supply Meeting <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>丨Still Opposing the Water Meter System丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Eastern Citizens Refusal to Cut Off Water Supply Association convened an executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, chaired by Wang Yaozeng, to discuss the Bureau of Works' newly revised interim water fee measures. Based on the two points raised by the various committees, a letter was sent to Feng Bingnan and the Bureau of Works' Chinese Directors. The letter to Feng is recorded below:</p>
<p>The letter sent on the 31st of last month, I think the registration room, the water fee issue was reported in the newspaper yesterday and the day before yesterday, Mr. Jianyi proposed a compromise solution, and will be implemented on April 1, admire Hongyou Shuojin, Hesheng admiration, but this matter is of great importance, related to the livelihoods of the common people, my association is in the situation, see and hear more closely, feel more deeply, repeatedly met, collect the opinions of the public, it is difficult to be satisfied with silence, slightly choose the outline does not dare to risk, respectfully for Mr. Chen. Check the original plan of the water company to take the level of rent as the standard for water fees, which is the class to adjust the poor and rich, the law to the United States, the intention to the good also, now Huhu install water meters, if used to measure the amount of water used in each area, by way of comparison of statistics, also can not be too thick, but according to the goal of increasing prices, It is inappropriate to make such a change of course. The company is originally of a business nature, and over the years, its income has been profitable and not a loss. After the water meter is installed, and before the water meter is installed, the comparison of its income is also fair and equal. What is the reason for the change of course? Why not be afraid of trouble, and what is the pleasure not to do, Yabi wants to add to the common people by means of oppression and abuse, what is the purpose of its insider? It is inconvenient to speculate, and the common people are suffering, and the masses are resisting, which is a matter of course. This kind of public undertaking should follow the former Prime Minister's livelihood doctrine and should be taken over by the state or the public, in order to stop the end of economic aggression. However, in the present situation, it is difficult to change and difficult to implement. The company has been collecting the economy of our citizens for decades, and I am afraid that it is not enough, and I hope that the company will realize it as soon as possible, so as to avoid the increasingly serious situation, or lead to international negotiations. According to the Mr. suggestions, the price of water meters is still determined by the level of rent, in the surface observation, it seems to be in line with the principle of equality, in fact, the common people are still suffering, the amount of usage, should be in the place where the rent is low, for the highest amount of water, the workers area houses are less and the population is large, the amount of water used, Naturally, it is better to have a wide range of houses, and less homeowners into an inverse proportion, this should be requested Mr. attention one also, the price of rent, except for the provisions in the 40 or 50 or more and 10 yuan or less, the middle is still no clear provisions, in more than 10 yuan and less than 40 or 50 of the rent, Gaiyu from the 40 or 50 of the standard, it is inevitable that the difference is huge, this should be requested Mr. attention two also, as for the provisions of the price of water fees, The rise and fall of rent is still in line with the principle of adjusting the poor and rich classes. Whether this newly revised measure can be passed is another matter. In short, according to the water meter system, in the near future, it will be difficult to avoid repeated changes, then from now on, disputes will arise, and social order will never be silent. It is why the association sees, sure to maintain the original system, absolutely deny the water meter, is a once-and-for-all plan, such as Mr. 's Mingda, its to think so or not, but also hope to inquire around the consultation, cautiously consider, this area of the public, under the cover of Mr. , the sense of gratitude is more profound, the opinion contributed, also feel more over-cut, but hope that Mr. efforts to carry out, exempt for the sake of the accumulation of prosperity also.</p>

The tenants hired lawyer Shan Yuhua to negotiate with the landlord based on reason, but the company ignored it and notified the tenants last year, on the pretext of increased water fees, that it wanted to increase rents. The tenants refused because they could no longer afford it. The two sides remained deadlocked. Suddenly yesterday (April 4), armed Western police came to seal the doors of as many as 69 households.

The child, with a sallow complexion and a shaved head, wore a grey old cloth jacket and long cotton-padded trousers, with black cloth shoes and dark-colored woolen socks. He claimed to be from Henan, did not know his age, was named Wu Jinsheng, and both his parents were dead. He had an older brother. Xu Baoshan brought him to Shanghai, and there were two other children with him at the time, but they had not been seen for several days. Guo Wangwo had visited, but he did not know anything else. Guo Wangwo admitted that two children, one one year old, sold for 75 dollars, and one six years old, sold for 55 dollars. Xu Baoshan and another person had brought them, saying that the children's father was poor, staying in an inn, and struggling to make ends meet, and wished to sell them to people to be their children. Later, they were sold to a Mr. Li in Xiaoshadu. She gave evasive answers. Xu Baoshan claimed that the money he received was all given to the children's families. Judge Wu reviewed the statements and sentenced Xu Baoshan to five years of imprisonment and Guo Wangwo to two years of imprisonment to set an example. The number of days detained before the judgment was finalized will be counted at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment. The child will remain in the care of the Women and Children's Relief Association.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Suspicious Death of a Female Worker <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>丨Rumor Has It She Died Due to an Abortion丨</p>
<p>Gao Ruyizi, a woman from Yangzhou, was twenty-two years old and had good looks. She was not yet married. Several years ago, her fellow townsman, Sheng Chunlan (currently forty-five years old), worked as a meal provider in the Dakang Cotton Mill on Pingliang Road in East Shanghai. The woman's parents, hoping to increase their income, sent Sheng to bring her to Shanghai and recommend her for work in the factory, entrusting Sheng to take care of her. As a result, the woman's food and lodging were provided by him, and her wages were used to supplement it. For several years, they lived peacefully. Unexpectedly, ten days ago, the woman suddenly fell ill. Sheng hired a traditional Chinese medicine doctor to treat her, but it was ineffective. Three days ago, her illness worsened, and she died in the early morning at around 2 AM. According to people in the factory, Sheng had an affair with the woman, resulting in a secret pregnancy. They performed an abortion to avoid being discovered, which led to her illness and death. The Yangshupu Police Station was notified and dispatched Chinese Detective Li Dacheng to investigate. He had the body taken to the autopsy room on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, he reported to the First Special District Court and requested Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to examine the body. The factory's night watchman, Japanese man Kikuchi Tadao, testified that he did not personally witness the abortion, but he had heard people say that the woman had an abortion ten days ago. He believed that Sheng found medicine for her to take, and no one was called to perform surgery. Sheng Chunlan testified that the deceased lived with him. Because she had a stomach ache, he hired a doctor for her and presented a copy of the prescription. He stated that he never had physical relations with her, but he did not know if she had a relationship with anyone else. He had notified her parents, who would come to Shanghai to take care of everything. After Guo's testimony, he determined that there was not enough evidence in this case and decided to order an autopsy. The hearing was rescheduled for this Thursday.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Armed Dissolution of Wusong Canal Workers <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Wusong Suidang Canal dredging project office, a large number of workers from other provinces have been hired, led by foremen, to carry out the dredging work. However, these workers were temporarily recruited, so their quality varied. Recently, there have been incidents of disrupting internal work and causing trouble outside. The foremen were unable to control them. It is learned that the Wusong Urban Suidang Canal Dredging Project Office, considering that these workers were disobedient and overbearing, and fearing that they would disrupt local public order, yesterday sent a letter to the Wusong Public Security Seventh District and the militia, requesting them to dispatch armed police to the vicinity of the old Wang Mansion in Paotai Bay to disperse more than 60 of these workers and escort them out of the area.</p>

<p>The Russian swindler, Er Qi, is thirty-seven years old this year and lives at house number 3, Yermoni Lane, Avenue Joffre. He has committed eight crimes in the French and British concessions. He was released from prison last year. Unexpectedly, he has recently relapsed. He issued fake checks to the rubber tire store run by the Westerner Luo Linsi at number 631, Avenue Huixu, the Lasi store at number 314, Avenue Albert, and the Xina Pharmacy on Avenue Joffre, obtaining goods worth several hundred dollars. When the victims were unable to cash the checks, they realized they had been defrauded and reported to the police, who ordered the detectives to arrest him and take him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahuang, explained the case and said that the police were investigating whether the defendant had defrauded other stores. He requested an adjournment for further questioning. The victims then complained about being defrauded. The defendant gave evasive answers. Judge Zhang Renkan ordered the defendant to post 6,000 dollars in cash and a guarantor for release pending trial.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Discussion on "Can one go back to the countryside?" <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>丨 Mr. You Huaigao of the Ziyou Farm on Connaught Road, Shanghai</p>
<p>Letter in response to Mr. Xiongsheng of this column丨</p>
<p>The prerequisites for going to the countryside: (1) Do you love the countryside? (2) Do you sincerely love the farmers in your village? (3) Can you resolutely endure hardship to make a living in the countryside? The advantages of the countryside are: (1) closeness to nature, without the pollution of the city; (2) honest people, without the deception of the city; (3) freedom of life, without the interference of the city. The hardships of the countryside are: (1) lack of support, unable to obtain material enjoyment; (2) people who have lived in the city for a long time may feel lonely and bored. However, I feel that in this time of national crisis, seeing the drunken, dreamlike lives in the cities, it is better to find a quiet and lovely village to seek a new path. Within my capabilities, I can spend ten years building a new-style Peach Blossom Spring in my mind. The city lacks food and materials, which the countryside can provide. Judging from the current situation in our country, farmers who know a few characters are truly as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Therefore, the countryside lacks talent. According to Mr. Xiongsheng, a talent who is an unemployed person with no place to be in the city is a leader who stands out from the crowd in the countryside. How can you say, "I don't have the guts to break the law, and I don't have the courage to commit suicide"? I absolutely advocate saving the country through rural education. The land of the Shanghai concessions is very limited and can never accommodate tens of thousands of returned students from various countries and graduates from universities and middle schools. The only way out for the intellectual class is to undertake the education and revitalization of the countryside. The life of a family of three in the countryside requires about four mu of farmland, or at least two mu near the city, but it must be cultivated by oneself with the cooperation of the wife to succeed. Given that Mr. Xiongsheng can only write and cannot plow, it is no wonder that he sighs and feels helpless. But I have a method to design for Mr. Xiongsheng: The first step is to teach: raise one or two hundred yuan (at least one hundred yuan) from relatives and friends. It is best to return to your hometown during this warm spring season, because dialect is extremely important. Find a village with relatively abundant production, a good livelihood, and a slightly larger population. Live in this village and stay for a few days to investigate the number of school-age children. If you rent two small houses from the villagers, the rent will be no more than ten yuan per year. One room can be used as a classroom, and the other as a reception room and bedroom. You can board with neighbors for three meals a day. This will save countless troubles and useful time for studying and reading. Subscribe to a daily newspaper and explain it to the villagers in your spare time. (When you have the strength in the future, you can buy a radio. I predict that the government will definitely use broadcasting to educate farmers in the future, because this is a powerful tool for universal education.) Mr. Xiongsheng's clothes can be Zhongshan suits made of cloth in spring, summer, and autumn, and cloth robes in winter. According to this plan, Mr. Xiongsheng's clothing, food, housing, daily life, and classroom problems can all be solved in a very economical way. Seventy percent of the education funding is for teachers' salaries, and miscellaneous expenses are even cheaper in the countryside. As for Mr. Xiongsheng's life, it can be done in the following ways: (1) Collect a small amount of tuition, one yuan per class, set it appropriately, and do not force it; (2) It is best to order each student to pay one chicken or one duck, or thirty eggs to the school at the end of each year. This chicken can be called the "reading chicken," which is not difficult for farmers, but it is an income for the school. I advocate having a sacrificial heart in the first year, and always spreading goodwill in the village to gain the trust of the farmers. After three or four years, when the students grow up, they will be your followers. The second step is to help farmers organize cooperatives. If it can be a little successful, banks in Shanghai and farmers' banks can provide loans. This is a very important matter. If this matter can be accomplished, your foundation will be very solid. The third step is to practice medicine and sell medicine. The most prevalent diseases in the countryside are autumn dysentery and red eyes. There are effective medicines that can cure these, such as quinine. However, only sell effective medicines and never be greedy and harm people's lives. This is also a source of income. The fourth step is that after the above three things are accomplished, your position will increase day by day, and the number of students will also increase day by day. You will be a leader in the village, and then you can carry out village governance work. But at the same time, you can communicate with various academic institutions, provincial construction institutions, agricultural schools, etc. to solve difficult problems. At the same time, you can also contact nearby villages or towns. If you feel that one person is not enough, you can invite one confidant to handle it together. Reporter's note: Mr. You Huaihuang is an enthusiastic advocate of saving the country through rural education. He has a lot of research on rural education and is a practitioner. I have received a letter in which he answers the letter from Mr. Xiongsheng in yesterday's column, "Can one go back to the countryside?" His kindness is admirable! In addition to publishing the original letter, readers are welcome to send letters to discuss any opinions.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 4th) At the Astronomy and Mathematics Discussion Meeting of the Ministry of Education, the members of the astronomy group were eager to continue the discussion on the morning of the 4th, so they did not participate in the tour. They held a group meeting at 8 o'clock. Nine people attended, chaired by Zhang Yuzhe. More than 200 astronomical translations were passed. Other group members all toured scenic spots. In the afternoon at 2 o'clock, the astronomy group continued the meeting, chaired by Zhang Yun. More than 300 astronomical translations were passed.

The mathematics group continued the discussion at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, chaired by Feng Zugou. The minimum required courses were passed, and about 50 kinds of reference books were examined. It was also resolved to ask the Ministry of Education and the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to jointly compile a series of mathematics books with professors, researchers, and researchers from various universities, and to encourage various bookstores to publish mathematics series as much as possible. The physics group, chaired by Hu Gangfu, resolved: 1. This discussion meeting will entrust the Physics Society to solicit opinions from various academic institutions to select excellent physics textbooks and important reference books for universities and middle schools, add detailed discussions, and submit them to the National Compilation and Translation Bureau. 2.

<p>First Game: Soochow University Wins Over Military Academy 35-33</p>
<p>Second Game: Soochow University Suffers a Close Loss 29-34</p>
<p>| Game Against St. Thomas University on the 9th |</p>
<p>The Soochow University basketball team, with its outstanding talent and profound skills, took advantage of the spring break and, led by Lu Zhongen, traveled with team members Feng Nianhua, Qian Jingyong, Wu Guolin, Lu Zhongen, Sun Baoqing, and others to Nanjing to compete against the Central Military Academy basketball team. Soochow University first won 35-33, then lost 29-34. The team returned to Shanghai by night train from Nanjing yesterday morning. It was learned that the team departed from Shanghai by night train on the 30th and arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 31st, staying at the Military Academy. Because they had not slept all night, the players were in poor spirits. The team requested that the game that evening be changed to the 1st, but the Military Academy stated that the tickets for the game had already been reserved and it was inconvenient to postpone it. Soochow University had no choice but to rest briefly and competed that evening at the Central University gymnasium. However, the basketball used was crooked and not round, and it was excessively heavy and unsuitable for use. Soochow University requested that the standard ball borrowed from the National Sports Association be used, but the Military Academy refused. As a result, each side used their own ball for half the game. Soochow University was at a disadvantage in the first half using the Military Academy's ball, but reversed the defeat and won in the second half using the Sports Association's ball. The second game was held on the evening of the 3rd. The Military Academy refused to use the Sports Association's ball again, and Soochow University requested that a standard ball be purchased for use, but the Military Academy said that it was impossible to purchase one. Soochow University had no choice but to continue using the Military Academy's ball, and as a result, they lost. As for the selection of the direction of the basketball hoops during the game, the drawing method was still used, and there was no distinction between host and guest. It is also heard that Soochow University has decided to play against the Philippine basketball champion St. Thomas University team on the 9th.</p>

<p>Limited Time Makes It Unlikely</p>
<p>The St. Thomas University basketball team from Manila, Philippines, is scheduled to pass through Shanghai on April 3rd on its way to Japan and Honolulu. They will play one game with Soochow University on the 8th upon invitation. It has recently been heard that the Jiangwan Chi Chih University Alumni Basketball Team, because it was during the annual vacation when they went to the Philippines, did not get to play a game with that school. Now that that school is passing through Shanghai, it is a rare opportunity, and they plan to arrange a friendly match. Veteran Li Zuqi has asked the Chinese Sports Association to contact them. The lineup of the Chi Chih Alumni Team is listed below: Ouyang Xuhui, Tan Dawei, Ni Guangzu, Li Zuqi, Wei Haiqing, Chen Hualuo, Xia Zeren, Kong Guangyi, Yang Linyu, Qian Dingshen, Chen Wenkui, Gu Guangdao, Yang Jun, Xia Yushu. However, the Philippine team will stay in Shanghai for a maximum of one day, and this game is unlikely to happen.</p>

That evening at 8:00 PM, they played a friendly match with the school's basketball team at the school's gymnasium. Fushi's forwards were active, and its defense was solid. Although Yancheng tried its best, it was only a futile hope. In the first half, Fushi won by ten points with a score of 24-14. As a result, Fushi won by a large margin with a score of 69-26. The referee was Wu Shijie.</p>

<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>| | Those Who Lost Their Nation Are Better | |</p>
<p>I never thought that the Jews, who have been without a country for so long, would still be feared and excluded in 1933, something even my family's Mr. Liu Renwen never dreamed of.</p>
<p>The Jews' ability to amass wealth and do business is many times greater than that of our country's respectable merchants who specialize in selling inferior goods. Taking Shanghai as an example, the great tycoon Hardoon cannot be compared with the big entrepreneurs who auction off their estates after their deaths.</p>
<p>The Jews have not only produced Hardoon in China, but in Europe, there are countless Jews who are richer than Hardoon and control the European economy. In the Americas, there is also the top-notch oil tycoon Rockefeller, who is also a Jew.</p>
<p>The Jews not only occupy an important position in the world's economy, but also contribute significantly to academia and science. The famous Mr. Einstein, who specializes in relativity, is one of the well-known Jews.</p>
<p>Speaking of Jews, they have a great background. There is also Comrade Marx, who is famous all over the world and will be remembered for thousands of years. When thieves see him, they laugh; when rich people see him, they jump. This old fellow brutally scooped out the core of history from "politics" and put it into the cavity of "economics", causing the unrestrained thoughts of today's youth and the terrifying situations everywhere.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Jewish state was inevitable, but it has produced so many great men, which shows that the destruction of a state is not a problem. After Jesus, so many famous people came out. After Confucius and Mencius, once our country is destroyed, after a thousand or eight hundred years, there will surely be some heroes who will shock the world and make the ghosts cry.</p>
<p>German Jews are being abused and excluded by Germans, and the stateless Jews scattered in various countries are united in boycotting Germany. Chinese people in foreign countries who have not lost their country are abused and excluded by the governments of their countries of residence, and the overseas Chinese elsewhere mostly eat more and say less. It is said that only slaves of a fallen nation need to unite. If we lose our country for a long time, we will surely learn that trick from the Jews.</p>

<p>Fight? Fine! I can't stand this insult at all! You want to attack Peiping? It's probably still early. Let's move the antiques to Nanjing first, and the students must run to Xi'an. Fine, you can come now, bombard with cannons, sweep with machine guns. What a joke, let's see if you can take away this place, or gnaw it down!</p>
<p>Tsk! Right! We have made this great determination, we are sure to scare the Japanese devils away! Now we are prepared for a long-term resistance, if you want to fight, you must also prepare a large sum of uncounted military expenses. Your equipment is good, but you suffer a loss, we only resist with spirit, do not fire cannons or guns, do you know how expensive a bullet is? Doing stupid things, we Chinese will not do. Moreover, we must be both loyal and filial, how can we let you injure our bodies and hair for nothing? Besides, have you learned any manners? Do you understand shame?</p>
<p>Fine! Fight! If you shamelessly occupy Peiping, we will move the antiques and students to Luoyang again. If you bombard Nanjing, and come to Luoyang to make trouble, we will unceremoniously run into Sichuan. There, all are dangerous waters, all are high mountains. Come? Are you afraid of the tigers in the mountains and the rapids in the water? If you still want to come, then... then... why bother, just don't give us any face? The place is occupied by you, the prestige is shown by you, and our long-term resistance and spiritual resistance are also cancelled, friend, what will make you happy? The days are long, the scientists have not yet calculated when the earth will be destroyed, you and I should keep some friendship, so we can meet again in the future.</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The Industry and Railway Exhibition of Jiaotong University opened last week. Having been away from my alma mater for almost two years, I was naturally excited to take part in this grand commemorative opportunity.</p>
<p>After two years of separation, my alma mater seems to be different in everything. We followed the arrow signs and moved forward. The first thing we saw was the road city exhibition. Inside were construction reports of municipal roads in various provinces, especially the municipal design model of Hankou was the most exquisite. The gymnasium was an exhibition of student achievements. The industrial exhibition was in the industrial building, divided into two floors, with as many as thousands of kinds of exhibits. Various machines and electrical appliances could also be tested on the spot. Automatic telephones could be used for on-site calls, and the Great Northern Telegraph Machine could receive and send messages on behalf of customers. Once the words were written at one end, the telegram was immediately received at the other end.</p>
<p>Large machines were displayed in the shed, and some were in operation. A relatively new and curious exhibit was the Jiangfeng aircraft of the Navy. The upper courtyard was the railway exhibition. Various railway bureaus had exhibits on display, especially the model of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, which was exquisite and lovely, and the most unique. From Nanjing to Ningbo, the tracks were winding, there were also platforms and signals, a small bag of rice was placed in the rice-producing area, a pile of coal was placed in the coal-producing area, and bright electric lights were hung on the electric poles along the line, and the train was running from time to time.</p>
<p>Around the school, a small railway was laid by Jardine Matheson, with a circumference of about half a kilometer. A diesel engine pulled four or five passenger cars, which ran at any time. Curious ladies rushed to be the first to take a ride. In this Industry and Railway Exhibition, there is one more thing worth noting, and that is the completion of Rong Hong Hall. Since Li Yaosheng became the principal, Jiaotong University's atmosphere has suddenly become vigorous. Zhixin West Zhai, Ferguson Sports Ground, Industrial Building, and Rong Hong Hall General Office have all been completed in a very short period of time. Here, we have to admire the greatness of the construction power, and express our admiration to Principal Li, who has worked hard and made great achievements.</p>

<p>— Fu Jingjia</p>
<p>The spring is gradually getting stronger. In order not to let it down, Hua and I decided to go to Longhua to inquire about the news of the peach blossoms. We rented two bicycles and enthusiastically set off for Longhua.</p>
<p>Gradually, we entered the embrace of the countryside. The fields were all green, and the willows along the road released yellow-green buds. Hua was extremely happy and sang a happy spring.</p>
<p>Longhua Pagoda was seen, how tall and majestic. The environment of the countryside is enviable enough. Hua said, "I must live in the countryside in the future."</p>
<p>What was unsatisfactory was that the peach blossoms had not yet bloomed. But we already felt that the spring was indeed strong.</p>
<p>In the setting sun, in the sound of returning sparrows, we returned to this dusty city again.</p>

<p>The rain kept falling, drizzling, drizzling. The entire street was shrouded in gloom and dimness. The signboards of the big stores standing out in the center of the street were lonely and drifting in the breeze and drizzle. Those square signboards with words like "official sauce" and "southern ham" were all crying and about to shed tears.</p>
<p>"Tell the news and sing the news! Da...da..." While singing, Douer beat the clapper. The vagrant's singing trembled through the empty street. He had a head of disheveled long hair; the breeze lifted the front of his gray-brown single cloth gown, revealing two thin yellow legs without socks; the mud splashed from the bottom of those broken shoes with holes in the front and back naturally glued the back of the gown to the calf.</p>

Look at the pair of men and women, with their heads wrapped in a square cloth and tied with waistbands and leggings, they may be from Fengyang... They sang along from house to house... "Do a good deed!..." A beggar dragged a wooden-wheeled cart with the upper half of another beggar's body on it, the lower half was an unattached infant leg that could rotate; and another bloody and festering leg stump...</p>
<p>The number of pedestrians was strangely scarce!</p>
<p>The arms of the rickshaw pullers hung despondently from the empty rickshaw handles.</p>

<p>Chapter Three: He Finally Tries to Untie the Knot, Visiting the Door, He Fondly Pitied the Maid Who Wished to Grow Old Celibate, He Offered Food and Kindled Hope.</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang said, "It's not that I want to grab this dish to cook, there are some little tricks in this, I can't go on stage myself. I have the effort to tell Little Lin the tricks, it's better for me to do it myself quickly. I told Little Lin to buy ingredients, but unintentionally heard a sentence from the big girl in front, which is really admirable. He learned from an ancient person, called 'maid who wished to grow old celibate', who is this..." As he spoke, he raised his hand and scratched his head, thinking with his head raised. Old Zhao smiled and said, "You're a big soldier, what kind of allusions are you talking about? Just say what it's all about." Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said, "I wanted to make a big deal, it would be easier to say it, I missed it when you pointed it out. He said that he would never marry and raise his mother, is this something rare or not?" Old Zhao lay on a soft chair, smoking a pipe in his mouth, his right leg resting on his left leg, trembling constantly, this was exactly the appearance of shaking his learning and also expressing the joy in his heart, he spewed out a puff of smoke and said, "According to me, his filial piety is a few points more sincere than you supporting me. How can I say this? Because he is a girl, it is not only rare to have this strength, but also rare to have this kind of thought." Zhao Ziqiang also took out a cigarette from his body, Old Zhao saw it, and stood up and handed him the pipe, so that he could light the cigarette. Zhao Ziqiang lit the cigarette, and still handed the pipe to Old Zhao, and sat down in the chair opposite, and said with a smile, "Your old gentleman's thoughts are a bit wrong in this year." Old Zhao smiled and said, "I also know, I have heard it said long ago, of all evils, filial piety is the head, of all virtues, lasciviousness is the first. But I also heard that now it doesn't matter what you talk about, it's all about economic relations. Then, parents have raised their children since they were young, and children raise their parents again, eight taels for half a catty, this is also an economic relationship, what's wrong with that?" Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said, "This is terrible, our old man also knows materialism, who told you this?" Old Zhao said, "There are two neighbors in our store, they always argue when they are enjoying the cool in the summer, I just listened to a few sentences, not knowing what they were talking about. Where did you learn it?" Zhao Ziqiang had not yet answered this question. (32)</p>
<p>Small Knowledge</p>
<h3 id="e185">Common Knowledge of Treating Illnesses with Fruit <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>(Watermelon) We should pluck and cut the stems of watermelons in the early morning, before the sun rises, without using knives, scissors, or similar tools (avoiding copper or iron), and instead use stones to break the stems. This watermelon has absorbed dew and hasn't been exposed to sunlight, so its sweetness and moisture are very abundant, which has the effect of clarifying the blood. Elderly people who eat it can treat kidney diseases, strokes, jaundice, beriberi, and disorders of the urethra, bladder, and heart. Eating a little before or after ordinary meals can gradually alleviate various diseases. If you have a cold with a high fever, eating a little watermelon can prevent kidney inflammation. Nowadays, Western medicine uses watermelon sugar to make medicine for kidney diseases and watermelon puree to make medicine for acute enteritis, catarrhal dysentery, and other diseases. Eating it when returning home tired on hot days can eliminate fatigue. Eating a few pieces of watermelon before labor or when planning to climb a mountain can increase strength. People who like meat can neutralize the irritation of meat. However, eating too much watermelon after 4 PM can cause abdominal cold and inevitable problems. Therefore, young children must pay attention. If bitten by bedbugs, wiping the bite with watermelon juice can treat the marks. My family has a wonderful formula for dysentery, which I now make public for readers: use very ripe, large watermelons, remove the seeds, chop them up with the rind, squeeze the juice in a cloth bag, put it in an earthenware pot, and simmer it over a low heat. When it's reduced by half, add four taels of rock sugar, stirring constantly for about five minutes, then seal it in a bottle. Anyone suffering from dysentery can drink one spoonful on an empty stomach every day, and it will surely be cured.</p>
<p>(Pear) Generally, when patients have a high fever and no appetite, chewing pears and swallowing the juice has a remarkable effect in relieving fever. Nowadays, many cooling agents in Western medicine are made with pear juice. If elderly people peel, chop, and boil pears with a little salt, it can relax muscles and promote blood circulation. If you remove the core, add rock sugar, steam until cooked, and squeeze the juice with a cloth, it can stop coughs.</p>
<p>(Fig) is a good medicine for treating hemorrhoids. Eating the fruit and using the leaves to make a decoction is even more effective. If you eat it every morning, it can not only moisten the intestines and relieve constipation, but also treat dysentery. In winter, if you pick a catty of figs, first wash them with salt water to remove any moisture, peel them, add four taels of rock sugar, and one cup of clear water, boil for twenty minutes to make a syrup. People with hemorrhoids can spread it on bread and eat it every morning, or use half a spoonful of vinegar and one spoonful of fig syrup, mix with boiling water, and drink it.</p>
<p>(Grape) Grapes have the richest nutrients among fruits. Foreign countries use eating grapes as an effective medicine for treating brain diseases and neurasthenia. However, when using this fruit for medicinal purposes, the seeds should not be removed, and eating more grapes is also harmless. If we take red and black small-grained grapes, cook them (without adding water), and store the grape juice in a bottle, we can mix it with boiling water and a little white sugar during winter colds and flu, and the effect will be remarkable. Drinking a little grape juice every night can prevent colds.</p>
<p>(Peach) When peaches are used as medicine, they have astringent properties, but unripe or spoiled peaches should not be eaten, as they can cause stomach and intestinal problems. There used to be a saying: eating peaches in the dark is very beneficial. In general, eating more peaches is very effective for skin injuries, sores, and other diseases.</p>
<p>We should understand the effects of the above five fruits on the human body, but no matter what it is, it should not be eaten excessively. It is best to eat it at the appropriate time and with the appropriate amount.</p>
<p>Correction: In the Shanghai Night Talk article "Smoking Shops," there are many misprinted characters, which are corrected as follows: (1) "French for Tobaco" should be changed to "French for Tabac" (2) "Spanish for Tabago" should be changed to "Spanish for Tobaco" (3) "Tabasco, one of the British islands" should be changed to "Tabago, one of the British islands" (4) "Tobacco in the Gulf of Mexico" should be changed to "Tabasco in the Gulf of Mexico" (5) "Xibagu" should be changed to "Danbaku."</p>

<h3 id="e186">On the Topic of Commodities <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>As soon as the national crisis arrives, telegrams are sent, volunteers enlist, officials sit tight, and donations are collected. It seems that everyone is of one mind, "sharing the national crisis together." However, "a brave soldier risks his life on the battlefield, while beauties dance in the general's tent." Some are "fighting hand-to-hand" on the front lines, while others are laughing and dancing with women in the rear. The other day, I was dragged to the Ambarsador by two friends, and I was shocked to see so many people dancing during this "national crisis." This is not to say that everyone has to be crying during a national crisis. There is no explicit legal provision against it, and although I "dare not lag behind others in loving my country," I have no deep resentment towards those who "do not forget entertainment while saving the country, and do not forget saving the country while entertaining." However, when I think of some people fighting bloody battles, while others, even if they contribute a little to "saving the country through aviation" or "saving the country through dancing," are still indulging in revelry, doing nothing, at least it cannot help but make people feel a sense of inequality among humans...</p>
<p>But what I want to say now is not about this.</p>
<p>"Like entering a shop full of abalone, you won't smell its stench after a long time." Friends who are always flipping and somersaulting in the human flesh market will not feel the ugliness of this market, but those who enter this foreign civilized dance floor for the first time cannot help but wonder what this society is really built on. Everything here has become a commodity: a woman's body is a commodity, and a woman's smile is also a commodity. Sinclair said that in the slaughterhouse, everything is useful except for the pigs' cries. I dare say that in this dance floor, even human breathing is a commodity (naturally, of women!). But this situation is not limited to the dance floor. I remember once going to a large hotel to meet a friend. I sat for two hours and saw a girl come in three times, each time dropping a flyer for female physiognomists. The text on each flyer was the same except for the name of Miss XX and the different photos, which proved that these were three different ladies. The flyer uniformly stated: "In addition to discussing physiognomy, all entertainment is declined," "Unwarranted gifts are respectfully declined," "Protecting personality and reputation is XX's only purpose," "Gentlemen, if you do not wish to discuss physiognomy, please do not invite." ...... If discussing physiognomy is a legitimate profession, why declare this? If you have to declare it, it shows that this profession has at least been exploited, and now it has been exposed. My friend said that this statement is precisely to tell you that you can inquire. It can be seen that there is another commodity here waiting for a price.</p>
<p>Someone else returned from Europe and passed through Saigon, where they saw that the opium dens there were posting advertisements for "new female attendants." So the commercialization of women has reached everywhere, universally.</p>
<p>Now that everything in China is being used to save the country, it seems inevitable that the above-mentioned commodities will also be borrowed to save the country.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Elementary School Teacher (Continued) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Written by H. Barbusse, Translated by Li Qingya</p>
<p>丨丨 Please don't speak! said the elementary school teacher, at this moment his face was ashen, his eyes staring straight ahead, his hands trembling slightly.</p>
<p>But the donkey-like roar of his opponent was even more pleasant to hear:</p>
<p>丨丨 You are lying! You are lecturing lies as homework. You are insulting this religion...... Justice...... Humph, justice! One should not talk about justice to Christians, it has nothing to do with Christians, justice is God. What should be talked about to Christians is only faith and love.</p>
<p>In front of the terrified students in the classroom, he shouted the word love at their teacher with an angry and forceful attitude, so this one had to retreat a few steps, his face even more ashen than before, and his eyes also widened. Then the students all stood up, causing a disturbance. He felt that he had failed and stammered:</p>
<p>丨丨 You are a rogue.</p>
<p>He had just vaguely said the last few words when the deputy priest pounced on him and grabbed his arms, and the head priest raised his hand to prepare to strike.</p>
<p>But the deputy priest didn't grab his arms tightly, because at that time there were two gunshots. The head priest fell to the ground, motionless like a pile of things, and the deputy priest struggled after falling but couldn't hold on.</p>
<p>Finally, this fierce elementary school teacher woke up from his own fanaticism, and then fired a third shot, and fell beside the two.</p>
<p>This is the situation in 1926, in a large country, where an elementary school teacher dared to talk to students about "justice" and died.</p>
<p>The record of this trivial matter was published by several bold daily newspapers, but it could not be found in the famous daily newspapers; everyone knows the purpose of the major newspapers, which is to conceal the truth.</p>
<p>Note: H. Barbusse was born in 1874. His early works include three types: a collection of poems, Weepers, and novels, Beggars and Earth. However, they did not attract much attention; it was not until 1916 that he published the book Fire, which described the lives of soldiers in the European War in a daily format, opposing the war of imperialism, and his reputation increased greatly, becoming a giant in the world of literature. Later, there were also two types of bright and serial novels, and three types of short story collections, such as We These People. At that time, the author founded Guangming Society in Paris, advocating human equality and opposing imperialism, and had moved from literary life to political movement, and also had many types of writings on society and history in the world.

<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>We watched the blue sky reflected in the lake water.</p>
<p>The lake water was so clear and soft, gently rippled by the breeze, like delicate dimples of laughter. The blue sky was also wrinkled all over. I looked at Qian next to me, who was staring at the lake water in a daze, and said: "Qian, how do these many shallow dimples compare to those on the face of movie star Miss Hu?" Qian loves the dimples on people's faces the most.</p>
<p>"You're wrong. Qian isn't thinking about Miss Hu's dimples. She's thinking about that Mr. Lu. Look, these ripples are just like Mr. Lu's bright eyes."</p>
<p>When Ping said this, I laughed. I thought of Mr. Lu coming to see Qian at our residence in the morning. Qian didn't say anything to deny it, just put on a coy smile and talked to friends on another boat. There were eight of us in this group, sitting on two boats, and we were sailing side by side.</p>
<p>The blurry distant mountains half embraced West Lake. Some buildings were reflected in the lake water, showing many black shadows, wriggling there. I had a strange yearning when I saw them. The boat slowly made another turn, and the place we had just passed became a golden strip of water. Many yachts were dragging such a golden strip, some slowly going away, and some lightly swinging over. The faces of the people on the boats were printed with light smiles, and their eyes had a dazed look, like sleepwalkers. Even more young men and women were sitting two by two on a boat, the breeze throwing their laughter into space, which was swallowed by the ripples on the lake.</p>
<p>"Let's go to Lakeside Park for a while." Someone on that boat suggested.</p>
<p>But we all opposed it, and didn't say anything. Only Qian said happily: "I like sitting on the boat like this the most. I can see everything. As long as there's a moon, I'd be happy to sit here all night tonight."</p>
<p>"Forget it. Mr. Lu is coming to see you tonight. You go play with him."</p>
<p>Everyone laughed. This group always likes to make jokes like that. The sun hung in the waist of the distant mountains, and the lake water shone even more like it was plated with gold. The scattered yachts all swung towards the side with the shining lights. On one side was the beautiful green mountain, and on the other side was the modern city market. The beautiful Xizi was wearing a modern dress. My companions began to sing popular songs. Only I was listening, looking at the lights reflected in the water, making my yearning dreams.</p>

<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(Thirteen) On Yi and Qi</p>
<p>When I first started writing, I liked to write profound and turbulent arguments. When I was young, after reading the Four Books, I secretly read Jin Shengtan's commentary on Romance of the Three Kingdoms. My tutor also ordered me to read Donglai Boyi, and Fan Gangjian. In Fan Gangjian, I liked Hu Zhitang's commentary the most. This man had a deep sense of morality and was particularly eager to defend the Tao. All historical figures who were not in the orthodox line of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Duke of Zhou, and Confucius were deeply criticized and overthrown. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, I was addicted to reading Jin Shengtan's comments before each chapter, thinking they were profound and clever, almost memorizing every paragraph. As for Donglai Boyi, I only liked its overturning of cases. I was deeply influenced by Jin Shengtan, Hu Zhitang, and Lu Donglai, but I didn't know it at first. My tutor, Mr. Mou, taught the Records of the Grand Historian, and gave the topic "On Yi and Qi". My essay roughly said that the Prince of Guzhu was fortunate to have a middle son, otherwise, Yi and Qi would have yielded the country and fled a hundred times, the throne would have been vacant, and would the country not have been destroyed and the sacrifice ended? This is being unfilial. If one knows that there is someone who can be established, but uses the yielding of the country as a noble act, using clever words to deceive the world, this is being unkind. If one is unbenevolent and unfilial, but people call them wise sages, isn't that slander? Mr. Mou wrote at the end of the essay:</p>
<p>The love of argument of petty people is like this? With the achievements of the two sons being so outstanding, they still cannot be spared, so what else can be said!</p>
<p>This uses Han Yu's words from the postscript to the biography of Zhang Zhongcheng, as Han Gong defended Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan from slander. After reading this comment, I admired Mr. Mou's intelligence, but I hated his meanness. At that time, Mr. Mou was posing as a hermit with purity and holiness, and his criticism of Yi and Qi was just what he envied. Not long after, Mr. Mou descended from Shouyang, and became a high-ranking official in the court.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Where is your wife?"</p>
<p>Haiquan asked him after sitting down.</p>
<p>"The child is a little unwell. She went out to buy medicine...... Really, this is unreasonable! She's been gone for three or four hours, and she hasn't come back yet!"</p>
<p>The last sentence was probably scolding his wife.</p>
<p>"When did your wife go out?"</p>
<p>"She went out early in the morning."</p>
<p>"What time was it?"</p>
<p>"We don't have a clock, we have to ask the landlord downstairs to know. But the one downstairs isn't very accurate either. She probably went out around seven or eight o'clock."</p>
<p>Haiquan thought after hearing this that even if she went out at eight o'clock, it had been two or three hours. What exactly did she buy that took so much time?</p>
<p>"Lao Lin, can you go out and buy me two or three sesame cakes? I want them salty."</p>
<p>At this moment, a bitter smile appeared on Shiguang's face.</p>
<p>"You haven't had breakfast yet?"</p>
<p>"Who's going to make it for me! She got up early in the morning and went out. And the child keeps wanting to be held. As soon as I put him down, he starts crying badly...... Ah! I really don't want to live this kind of life anymore!"</p>
<p>After Shiguang said this, he sighed deeply. The child in his arms responded to his sigh with a loud cry.</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah!...... Ah!......"</p>
<p>Shiguang picked up the child and swayed him from side to side. The way he looked made people laugh, but his throat seemed to be stuck by something. The sound of "Ah, ah!......" was also sung very badly, not as clear and pleasant as his wife sang.</p>
<p>"Okay. I'll buy sesame cakes for you. Is three enough? You don't want fried dough sticks?"</p>
<p>"It's okay to buy two more fried dough sticks. There are copper coins in my drawer, you take them out."</p>
<p>"No. I have them here."</p>
<p>Haiquan said and ran downstairs. But as soon as he stepped out of the back door, he saw Cao Shiguang's wife walking into the alley with a small vegetable basket.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Lin, when did you come? Why don't you sit for a moment? Are you leaving already?"</p>
<p>When she saw Haiquan, she seemed to have an indescribable joy, she was just saying and smiling. Haiquan saw that she looked a little better than yesterday. It was probably because she went out and put on makeup.</p>
<p>"No. I came out to buy sesame cakes for Lao Cao."</p>
<p>"Oh! Then I'm sorry, Mr. Lin. Don't buy them, Mr. Lin. I've already bought buns and came back......"</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Looking at Qiuying's charming appearance, Haiquan unconsciously asked her the two words "Really?"</p>
<p>"Why would I lie about this!"</p>
<p>"Sorry."</p>
<p>He smiled and turned back into the alley. She came closer and walked all the way with her shoulder close to his. Haiquan smelled a strange</p>
<p>fragrance, it seemed to be the fragrant oil she put on her hair.</p>

<p>The Previous Market Saw Unfavorable Overseas News, But Dalian Inflow Tendency Was Strong</p>
<p>In the Afternoon, Foreign Exchange Was Tight and Loose, Rising to 100 Yuan Before Retreating</p>
<p>Both the Guangdong and Dalian Groups Were Mostly Buyers</p>
<p>The gold market rose sharply yesterday, mainly due to overseas reports of London spot and forward discounts narrowing to 1/875, New York silver prices shrinking by 0.25, and slight increases in both British-American and American-British exchange rates. Silver prices on the forward market of the metal exchange fell by 0.04, private cables from banks, and American cotton all declined, leading to more stable sentiment. Prices initially rose from 95-96 yuan to 97-98 yuan. The morning opening was at 1095.5 yuan, with the exchange market opening slightly firm. After opening, it improved further. The Dalian group sought to settle US exchange but failed, so they aggressively pursued forward bids, once reaching as high as 1098.5 yuan. Suddenly, news came from overseas that the US might reduce the fineness of gold, causing the exchange market to harden slightly, but it was still able to fluctuate. After entering, banks became congested. HSBC's listing of forward prices remained unchanged, with US dollars slightly lower by 0.125. The Dalian group sold 350 bars on behalf of the Tianjin group, causing a decrease to 91 yuan. Afterward, the trend remained stable, and the banks' appetite improved slightly. The gold market also showed signs of recovery, once returning to over 7 yuan. However, the midday close was at 1094.6 yuan. The afternoon market opened at 1096.2 yuan. The exchange market suddenly tightened. Banque Belge ate US dollars for this month at 28.75 yuan, and Mercantile Bank ate July's at 29.3125 yuan. For a time, buyers gathered and competed to purchase, and the amount seemed scarce. Sentiment was uncertain, and although the rise was rapid, the decline could also be easy. Internal bank prices turned firm, with July's at 3.75 being difficult to sell, before falling to 3.2 jiao. Finally, it remained flat, closing at 1098.2 yuan. It was observed that although the environment in the forenoon was poor, the Dalian group's entry into the market led to stability. In the afternoon market, the exchange market was tighter, leading to a better outcome. The smelted price was increased by 27 yuan, and the swap spread was from 14 yuan to 15 yuan. The daily market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 1095.5 yuan, an increase of 6.7 yuan compared to the previous close. The goods opened at 5 yuan.

Goods initially came for arbitrage, retreating from 6 yuan to 4.2 jiao. Shunli entered the market to buy, leading to an increase. Although Yuan Mao Yong Fu Shun sold at this time, it was due to Shunli's continuous aggressive buying that Chun Yuan Yong also joined. The reason was that no one was willing to sell June's US dollars at 29.1875 yuan, and it rose to 7.8 jiao. Fu Chang sold, retreating to 6 yuan. The Dalian group grabbed July's US dollars at 3.75, but the banks were unwilling to release them. The trend remained stable. Da Xing Yong Lai entered, leading to a surge to 1098.5 yuan. There were many who wanted to sell within the 9 yuan limit. Heng Yu Da De Cheng also came to sell, gradually declining. When Fu Chang came to sell bars, unfavorable news suddenly came from overseas. Heng Yu Chun Yuan Yong sold even more. For a time, the selling trend became strong, and the decline was not weak. HSBC even congested June's US dollars at 1/875, plunging by 6 yuan, falling to 2.5 jiao. Heng Yu took advantage of the low price to buy in, and Fu Yu also joined. Mitsui ate June's US dollars at 1/875, rising to 5.5 yuan. Zhao Feng Chang still sold at around 4 yuan. Citibank came out with June's US dollars at 1/875, and Bing Xing sold at 3.5 yuan.

Mitsui grabbed July's US dollars at 3.75, and banks wanted to settle June's at 1/875, improving to over 5 yuan. Yi Feng Yong Hong Li competed to purchase, reaching 7.5 yuan. However, in a short time, July's US dollars at 3.125 and June's at 1/125 were difficult to sell. Da De Cheng sold at within 5 yuan. Qian Chang Xiang Yong Feng sold even more, retreating to 3 yuan. Yuan Sheng Yong aggressively sold over 300 bars, dropping to 2 yuan. The Dalian group Shunli vigorously bought 420 bars, and Wan Xing also entered a large amount. Zhong Fu grabbed July's US dollars at 4/375, still able to recover. Da Xing Yong also purchased, improving to over 5 yuan. Mitsui continuously grabbed July's US dollars at 3.75, rising to 7.5 yuan. Heng Xing sold slightly, and Zhao Feng Chang also sold, retreating to 4 yuan. Before long, the midday close was at 1094.6 yuan.

Citibank and others released this month's US dollars at 28.75 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong sold to 4.8 jiao. However, Heng Xing still came to buy. Da De Cheng also entered, improving to over 7 yuan. Mitsui grabbed July's US dollars at 3.125. Yuan Mao Yong suddenly joined, gradually rising to over yuan. Although Zhao Feng Chang came to sell, it was because Banque Belge ate this month's US dollars at 0.75, and Mercantile again entered July's at 29.3125. Yuan Mao Yong came to buy again, at around 9 yuan. Da Xing Yong Fu Yu also came to buy. The market conditions greatly improved. In addition, Bing Xing also came to enter bars, leading to a surge to 1100 yuan (a small number of transactions). Banque Belge sold to Zhejiang May's US dollars at 0.875. Heng Xing Zhao Feng Chang sold slightly, retreating to 98 yuan. Bing Xing Yuan Mao Yong still bought, at 9 yuan. At this point, retail investors all sold out, and the gold price gradually turned around, retreating within 8 yuan. The trend was gentle, slightly static. Banque Belge again congested May's US dollars at 0.875. Yuan Tai came to sell, at 7.6 jiao. Heng Xing entered the market, and Sassoon also ate May's US dollars at 9.375, returning to 8.3 yuan. Before long, Mitsui sold May's at 9.375, and Fu Chang entered the market to sell bars, retreating to 4 yuan. Bing Xing slightly bought, pulling up by 1.8 jiao.

Wan Xing Fu Yu entered, rising to over 5 yuan. Mercantile Banque Belge both grabbed July's US dollars at 3.75. Yong Feng aggressively entered, and Ri Chang also bought, leading to an increase.

It was observed that the highest price during the day was 1100 yuan, and the lowest price was 1091 yuan, with a fluctuation of 9 yuan. The result was an increase of 9.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The indicated price was calculated because HSBC's US dollar listing was slightly lower by 0.125, calculated at 28.375 yuan, with a combined standard gold price of 23827 at 1174 yuan. According to the closing price, approximately 76 yuan was discounted. If calculated with a combined 24000 at 1183 yuan, approximately less than 85 yuan was discounted, which was 4 yuan less discounted than the previous close. The registered amount for this month was 1109 yuan, for May 1095 yuan, the morning water supplement was 1107 yuan, and the afternoon was 1110 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was not lively. Overall, Shunli Wan Xing Heng Xing Bing Xing Rui Kang Chun Yuan Yong Rui Xing Hong Li Fu Yu Yong Feng Ri Chang, etc., all entered the market.

<p>The swap spread for April and May gradually increased, initially increasing to 14 yuan. Fu Tai Heng spread 55 bars to Qian Chang Xiang (Tai Kang Run). After entering, this price was difficult to achieve, mainly because the smelted price was expensive, and current goods dealers were temporarily silent. Fu Tai Heng spread 35 bars, and Da De Cheng spread 21 bars, all taken in by Ying Feng Heng at 15 yuan. Later, Ying Feng Heng got lucky.</p>
<p>Tianjin group goods arrived, and they came to swap out. Qian Heng spread 1 bar, Heng Yu 35 bars, then 196 bars, and Yong Feng 35 bars, still taken in by Ying Feng Heng at 15 yuan.

<p>| Adding Several Special Transaction Items Starting Tomorrow |</p>
<p>Recently, remittance banks have been affected by the trend, making it difficult to extend credit. It is difficult to stick to old rules, so they are changing and creating new avenues. This year, many of these money shops have changed to imitate banking business. The first ones were Fu Yuan and Yin Tai, etc. Now, it is heard that Tong Qing Bank will also imitate them and has decided to add several special transaction items starting tomorrow (6th). All shops, factories, firms, and individuals can directly open accounts without introduction, and they are the same as existing transactions, with interest calculated once a month. The procedures seem to be more convenient than banks.</p>

<p>| Cotton Mills Do Not Enter the Market at All |</p>
<p>The sales of yarn and cotton yarn are still good, but less than yesterday. Because the futures market is closed for the Spring Festival, people lack confidence and are unwilling to take much action for business. However, some are more interested in entering the market because cotton mills have reduced their work by half, fearing realization. However, judging from the general trend, all parties feel that the economy is depleted, and there is fear that there will not be a large amount of consumption. As for the overseas cotton industry, it is still in decline. The Japanese invasion of North China is increasingly fierce, and the smoke of war is pervasive, which has a great impact on commerce. The statistics of various groups buying spot yarn for the whole day totaled 304 bales. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The buying volume of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 35 Shantou 90 Ningbo 8 Peer 25</p>
<p>Guangdong 140 Wuhu 4 Luzhou 2</p>
<p>There were no transactions in raw cotton because the American crepe turned sluggish again, and the mills' appetite was even weaker. However, the gold market was firm, and there were no transactions all day.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, over 30 sources, the urban and rural shops were sluggish, and the bag appetite was also slackened, so the market conditions were weak. The rice prices of Sutong Gang and Nangang Qingjiao, etc., were slightly lower by 1-2 jiao. Observing the overall situation, there is no hope of a turnaround in the next day or two. Duyang Jian and Yinbian Yuan prices have no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, over 30 sources from various gangs in Hexia, Bai Geng shops were equally appetized, and the four villages were also stagnant. The market shape of high-priced goods was slightly lower by 1 jiao, and medium- and low-grade goods were slightly lower by 2 chi. The low-grade and high-priced thin rice was weak. The mid-grade and low-grade were slightly lower by 1 jiao. Yang Jian's arrivals continued, and the retail appetite was normal.

<p>| The Total Market Does Not Reach a Thousand Bales on Lianben Street |</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian Min Ban suddenly stopped, and the total market only had 410 bales of Jiangxi Ji Wan to respond to the scene. Because new foreign rice arrived, and the existing Ke Xian stock on the market was also sufficient, the sources continued one after another. After a drop at the end of last month, the market has been building up recently, so they took the opportunity to stop, intending to abandon the small market price and then continue. However, the owners' minds were very firm, and they were unwilling to sell at a depreciated price, so the market remained flat. Jiangxi Ji Wan opened at 8.5 yuan to 8.14 yuan. Lianben Street responded to 110 bales of Jiangxi Ji Zao, priced at 6.45 yuan to 6.35 yuan. 100 bales of Hunan Ji Hong, priced at 8.32 yuan.</p>

<p>Raw Oil Customer Sales are Also Strong</p>
<p>The soybean cake market has been stable recently. Because the factories do not have a backlog of spot goods, the asking price is firm, and they receive a continuous appetite. Yesterday, Chang Ji's three-brand cake sold 1,000 pieces, priced at 1 tael 2 qian 7. Hengde's three-brand cake sold 500 pieces, priced at 1 tael 2 qian 5. Dalian Guangbian sold 1,500 pieces, priced at 1 tael 2 qian 6, all bought by the mainland gang. Only 650 pieces of raw oil were sold yesterday. Boer Xinfeng sold 50 pieces first, priced at 11 taels. Because there were still inquiries from Fang Shang, Yuan He Chang sold 50 more pieces, priced at an additional 1 qian. 250 pieces were transacted in Jiaozhou, priced at 10 taels 0 qian 5. 300 pieces were opened in Jia Cang, priced at 10 taels 0 qian 9. The export gangs slightly purchased, causing people to tend to be flat. The future situation may be stable because the sources are not surging.</p>

<p>| Coarse Granulated White Rises Another 5 Fen |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose again due to the standard gold, and the Dutch exchange rate did not increase, so the trend was particularly tight. The association divided the market, and 2-4 coarse granulated white was transacted at 15 taels 1 qian for 2-300 bags, up 5 fen from the previous day. Later, it became tighter, and no one was willing to bid that price again, so it called up 5 fen, asking for 15 taels 1 qian 5. The 20th grade medium granulated white called 14 taels 6 qian 5, and the 18th grade 14 taels 4 qian 5, all calling up 5 fen. The 8th and 9th grade Dutch red still called 12 taels. Several thousand bags of high-grade domestic Xinmian red opened yesterday, priced at 11 taels 6 qian. The existing goods of Hainan red were of lower quality, and all firms lacked interest in entering the market. It was heard that Guangdong ships could enter the market with 1,100 bags to continue arriving today. The newly arrived goods will inevitably be better, so the firm's attention has shifted to this, resulting in no transactions for the old stock. This factory opened a batch of 2nd grade ice yesterday, priced at 17 taels 7 qian.</p>

<p>Longkou Vermicelli has been gradually declining in recent years due to sluggish sales and appetite in various directions.

Recently, it opened at 16 taels 7 qian, a decrease of 8 qian. The firm's plate is even more accommodating due to the sparse sales, and the lowest price is 16 taels 5 qian.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market remained without a turnaround. Although there were a few white filature yarn transactions via telegraph in New York yesterday morning, Ganli and other firms negotiated with various factories, but due to Evens' opening price of 91.2 points at only 512.20 taels, the factories still found the losses too great and difficult to sell, leading to a stalemate. Yesterday, only the Huchou Silk Factory entered 10 packages of Jinma brand 18-22 denier white filature yarn, priced at 500 taels. Renji entered 10 packages of Feiji brand 13-14 denier white filature yarn, priced at 525 taels. Xiangli entered 10 packages of Tonghe brand Qili white dry filature yarn, priced at 420 taels.

<p>Lu Filature Yarn: 3,800 bales / Sichuan-Hubei Filature Yarn: Slightly over 2,000 bales</p>
<p>The yellow filature yarn produced in Sichuan, Shandong, Hubei, and other provinces of China is widely sold to Europe and the United States. In recent years, due to the global economic panic, the sales of silk fabrics have been sluggish and prices have weakened. European and American silk weaving factories have strived to reduce costs, and Japanese silk has taken the opportunity to dump goods at low prices. Rayon has also surged in like a terrifying wave, causing the sales of Chinese silk in Europe and the United States to plummet. The purchasing power of Germany and Switzerland has declined. Yellow filature yarn from Sichuan, Shandong, and other provinces is difficult to sell due to high costs and low prices. Since the beginning of the year, financial turmoil overseas has repeatedly occurred, and the consumption of raw silk has greatly reduced. The sales of Chinese silk to Europe have become increasingly stagnant. The yellow filature yarn from Sichuan and Shandong is almost at a standstill. It is now found that the Shanghai warehouse stocks of the aforementioned yellow filature yarn total more than 5,700 bales, including 3,800 bales of Shandong yellow filature yarn and 1,967 bales of Sichuan-Hubei yellow filature yarn. The spring silkworms in various provinces are about to emerge. Before the spring cocoon market, there may be no possibility of dumping.</p>

<p>More than 600 pieces arrived on Jiang'an and other ships yesterday</p>
<p>The European sales of silk cocoon waste produced in Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces are still difficult to improve, and the inventory in the producing areas is not weak. As the spring cocoons in various regions are about to emerge, and the new cocoon market is less than two months away, silk cocoon merchants are generally shipping their stocks to Shanghai one after another. Yesterday morning, Jiang'an, Jihe, and other ships loaded a total of 625 pieces of ti shou, wan shou, jin zi, tang zi, etc. from Hankou, which were all sold on the spot, it is said.</p>

<p>Suian green tea is an important part of Luzhuang tea. In recent years, due to the early picking and rapid transportation in that region, it has occupied a superior position in terms of time, and merchants have often made profits. Therefore, tea merchants this year are paying close attention to the tea affairs in that region. Tea firms such as Yongxinglong, Yuanfengrun, Yongshengchang, Gongsheng, Yongshengchang, and Changsheng, etc., have all released large amounts of tea funds. Tea production companies are also actively proceeding in recent days. More than 20 local Shanghai tea production factories are also planning to send personnel to that area to purchase tea, it is said.</p>

<p>The Shanghai foreign firm tea market has become increasingly quiet recently. The Zhenmei tea from Tunxi, Shexian, Suian, and other regions has all been sold out. Although there are thousands of boxes of Wuyuan wax-light Zhenmei tea in stock, the sales in Africa are extremely sluggish. Only Jinlong and Yihe firms have purchased 68 boxes in recent days, with a selling price of 76 taels. The market situation is very sparse, it is said.</p>

<p>Heavy Rain Last Night, No Fierce Fighting on the Front Lines</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Bombard Our Haiyang Town Rear Area in Large Numbers</p>
<p>(Beiping) After our army recovered Haiyang Town yesterday, it actively reinforced troops to the line of Shimen Village, Liujiang, and Haiyang Town. It is not easy to defend firmly unless all three places are obtained. The enemy is also aware of this intention, so it has increased 4,000 to 5,000 troops near that line. There was no major contact due to the heavy rain last night. There will be a major battle this morning. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) At 5:00 AM on the 5th, after Haiyang Town was recovered, 400 enemies repeatedly attacked fiercely, but were repelled. At 7:00 AM, enemy troops were very active seven miles northeast of Qinhuangdao, attempting to spy on Qin Island. Enemy aircraft heavily bombed Haiyang. Enemy aircraft reconnoitered in Funing, Lulong, and Qian'an. At noon, one aircraft came to Luan, circled once, and went east. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the morning of the 4th, Haiyang was once breached by the enemy, and the situation in Qin Island suddenly became tense. Thousands of refugees fled to the station, causing disorder. In the afternoon, we recovered Haiyang, and order was restored.</p>

<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo telegraphed Ping on the 4th, stating that at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, about 3,000 to 4,000 enemy troops from the Japanese invaders' infantry, cavalry, and artillery attacked Haiyang Town along the Liuhe Railway. One part advanced from Anminzhai and Dawangzhuang to spy on Qin Island, and another part pressed on Pingshanying from Shangxiaping Mountain. Our army resisted bravely with all its strength. At 3:00 PM, three Japanese aircraft reconnoitered in Haiyang Town, and at the same time concentrated artillery fire and fiercely bombed the positions of our cavalry Wang Shi. Our officers and soldiers suffered heavy casualties. The stalemate lasted until dawn on the 4th, when the enemy increased its troops and launched a fierce attack on us, using aircraft and armored vehicles to assist in the battle, and attacked Haiyang Town. After a long and fierce battle with our army, the enemy once occupied Haiyang Town. Our front-line commander [illegible] commanded the [illegible] divisions and personally led the counterattack, fighting hand-to-hand for three hours. Both sides suffered heavy casualties.

<p>(Tianjin) Because Haiyang Town was once lost on the evening of the 4th, and we counterattacked and recaptured it at noon, the artillery fire was fierce, and Qin Island heard it clearly, causing panic. Some stores closed. It gradually calmed down in the afternoon of the 4th. Many people took refuge in Changli and Luanzhou. Passenger trains only ran seven or eight times to Qin, and passengers were crowded. Foreign observers believe that if Japan invades Qin, it will inevitably cause international disputes. The British, due to mining and railway debt relations, will protest first. He Zhuguo is currently commanding near Beidaihe, and Qin's defense is secure. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Flying at an Altitude of 16,000 Feet in Gale-Force Winds and Rain</p>
<p>Terrifying Scene of the Sea Surface Illuminated by Electrical Discharges at Midnight</p>
<p>Seventy-Three People Including the Director of Naval Aviation Perished</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th - Navy Major Wiley sent a wireless telegraph reporting the circumstances of the loss of the Navy airship Akron on the night of April 3rd from 10:00 PM to midnight. Wiley was one of three survivors, initially rescued by the German ship Phoebus and then transferred to the coastal patrol boat Cutter. The telegram was sent from the Cutter. This is the first official report received, stating that the Akron was surrounded by electrical discharges at 10:00 PM last night while flying at an altitude of 16,000 feet in gale-force winds and rain, constantly changing direction. It began to descend at midnight. Half an hour later, it dropped its ballast sandbags. At that time, there were still electrical discharges on all sides, and the turbulence was quite severe. During its descent, the stern was downwards. Suddenly, its rudder was lost, and the ship touched the surface of the water and was immediately destroyed. The sea was illuminated by incessant flashes of electrical discharge, creating a terrifying scene. At first, people were seen struggling to swim amidst the wreckage of the airship, but in an instant, they all disappeared. Before the destruction, the flight deck was completely calm, with no signs of panic, it is said.</p>

<p>It has now been determined that there were 19 officers and 57 enlisted crew members on the Akron. The whereabouts of only five people are known. Four were rescued by the German ship Phoebus, but one died shortly after. The other, Navy Major McLelland, was recovered today. The three survivors are Navy Major Wiley, crew members Thiel and Owen. Navy Executive Officer Guffran, although rescued, later died on the Phoebus. The Navy patrol boat Cutter has today sent the three survivors ashore. They all refused to talk. Only Wiley, wearing a tightly fitting military uniform, mumbled that he was fine, it is said. Thiel was sent to the hospital on a stretcher after landing. He was also in distress during the loss of the US Navy airship Shenandoah in 1925. Several ships are still searching for the victims amidst the wreckage of the Akron floating on the sea surface, but they are facing great difficulty due to rain and fog. The location of the Akron's loss is about 20 miles from the Barnegat Lightship.</p>

<p>The loss of the Akron, according to general opinion, has dealt a fatal blow to airships. It is feared that no one will promote airships commercially or militarily from now on. Vincent, the chairman of the committee investigating the loss of the Akron, declared that no more airships would be built in the future. The United States built a total of three airships, and two have been lost. It is found that the United States spent US$20 million to build this type of airship, and the Shenandoah and now the Akron have been destroyed. Only one ship remains, named Macon. Navy Secretary Swanson said today that he has never been as enthusiastic about airships as others, and also said that the Akron's sister ship, Macon, will be sent to the West Coast to cooperate with the fleet as originally planned, it is said. One of the most prominent victims of the Akron was Rear Admiral Moffett, the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics. The National Aviation Monthly published an article by the admiral on the Akron in January 1932, stating that although the Akron was overweight, its navigation was not affected under normal conditions, and that the reason for the increase in weight was due to changes ordered by the Navy to improve its safety and military effectiveness, it is said.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 5th - Navy Major Wiley, wearing hospital clothes, told a group of reporters today about the circumstances of the loss of the Akron, stating that the airship showed no signs of being struck by lightning. There was no explosion or fire inside the ship. Near midnight, the airship began to descend rapidly. At that time, all engines were running at full speed. He threw all the ballast sandbags carried on the ship into the sea. The airship tilted forward to about 800 feet above the ground, then immediately rose. It stabilized at about 1,500 feet above the ground. Three minutes later, the air became unstable. The bow rose considerably. He knew he was near the center of a major storm, so he ordered everyone on board to prepare. The airship then tilted quite severely, and the control cables and the upper rudder were lost in the wind. Wiley then tried to steer with the lower rudder. He moved to the right side of the control machine to steer, while the captain was on the left side to operate the elevator. At that time, the bow was tilted upward at about 20 degrees. The ship dropped rapidly. Nothing could be seen outside the ship except for the heavy fog. He asked what the altitude was, and was told it was 300 feet. He then ordered everyone on board to prepare for the inevitable destruction. Everyone was calm and handled matters, but in an instant, the ship hit the water. Seawater poured in through the windows. He hurriedly swam out of the ship. When he reached the surface of the water, he saw the airship drifting away with the waves in the constant flashes of electrical discharge. The bow was facing the sky, and the hull was completely destroyed. Then he saw the lights of the Phoebus. He struggled to swim towards the ship, grabbing a board and swimming while holding it. He heard cries for help on the water. The Phoebus threw a rope into the water and hauled him onto the ship, but the others were farther away from the Phoebus.</p>
<p>Reuters, Atlantic City, 4th - Navy blimp No. 3, while searching for survivors at the scene of the Akron's loss tonight, crashed and sank in a gale. A seaplane flew to rescue them.

<p>British Government Publishes Details of Negotiations</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - The British authorities today published a White Paper disclosing documents from the British Ambassador to Russia, Voffan, reporting to the British Foreign Office after six British technicians from the Vickers Electrical Company were detained on March 12th. All six detainees, except for MacDonald, have been temporarily released, each on bail of 50,000 rubles. However, the Russian employees who were detained were not allowed to be bailed. British technician Monkhouse was interrogated for 19 hours. Monkhouse admitted that he regularly reported the business situation to Vickers Electrical Company based on reports from various technicians. The interrogator then pointed out that this was a criminal act of secretly inquiring for information. Monkhouse also admitted that 25% of Vickers Electrical Company's turbines were unsuitable for use, the reason being that the Russians did not want to use standard machines. Vickers Company is now quickly trying to correct various defects. British Ambassador Voffan wrote to the Foreign Office on March 14th, reporting on his visit to the prisons where British technicians Thornton and Gregory were detained, stating that "the two technicians had clearly endured hardship and were in unspeakable misery." On March 16th, the British Ambassador reported to the Foreign Office on his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov. At that time, the British Ambassador stated that this was not a matter of sovereignty, but a question of whether the British could reside and conduct business in Russia. Litvinov replied that strong words would not have any effect on the Soviet government. At the end of the meeting, the British Ambassador stated that Russia was deliberately destroying British-Soviet relations and that he was very disappointed. He had initiated British-Soviet relations, and unfortunately, it seemed that he would be the one to sever them, it is said.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - The British government's bill submitted to the House of Commons to ban the import of Russian goods is quite concise, with only four clauses, advocating that the government should ban the import of all kinds of goods produced or manufactured by the Soviet Russian Federation by order. This bill will come into effect on April 18th. It does not apply to transit goods. The bill stipulates that any goods manufactured half in Russia and half elsewhere will be regarded as Russian goods unless it can be proved that the goods were completed elsewhere after leaving Russian territory, accounting for at least a quarter of their value. The bill also contains remedies for failure to fulfill contracts due to the declaration of the ban. The bill authorizes the Department of Trade to issue special licenses for the import of prohibited goods. After the second reading of the bill, opposition leader Cripps moved to strike down the bill this evening, stating that the White Paper did not show sufficient reasons why the British government required the unconditional release of the arrested persons, nor did it show sufficient reasons why the British government needed to obtain the special powers proposed in this bill for retaliatory reasons against Russia, it is said.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - A well-known London lawyer, Cazalet, who is fluent in Russian, will go to Moscow to defend the arrested British technicians in court if he is granted special permission by the Russian government.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 5th - Before being released on bail, the Russian authorities officially filed an indictment against British technicians Cushny, Thornton, and Gregory, accusing them of committing crimes of secretly inquiring for political and military information and damaging machinery. Thornton alone was also charged with bribery. The defendants all pleaded guilty. It is said that a Russian lawyer has agreed to defend the defendants.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 4th - Three of the six British engineers from the detained Vickers Company, Keshina, Gregory, and Thornton, were released on bail today. However, all signed a statement not to leave Moscow and to appear in court when summoned. The bail money was paid by the company this morning.</p>

Today, Berlin police, accompanied by the National Socialist Brownshirts, went to the Jewish residential areas to search pedestrians and residences very strictly. Although religious ceremonies in synagogues were not obstructed, worshippers were carefully checked when they left the synagogues. Anyone carrying suspicious business cards, or whose answers were not satisfactory, were taken to the police station in freight cars.

However, before making that decision, the Japanese Foreign Ministry studied the various issues that would arise after withdrawing from the League, the impact on all aspects, and the feasibility of sanctions under Article 16 of the Covenant, to provide a basis for the fundamental principle of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. As a result of this investigation, it was concluded that the sanctions under Article 16 could not be implemented. Thereupon, the Japanese government made the final decision and announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27. The Foreign Ministry's report to the government is very long. The following is a brief summary of the contents for the reference of the world.</p>

<h3 id="e259">Interpretation and Application of Article Sixteen of the Covenant <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>(1) Having experienced the result of the World War, all nations deeply feel that the basic meaning and international obligation of Article 16 should be implemented and observed through international sanctions. Before the Great War, the implementation of international sanctions agreements barely existed in practice or regulations, so there were very few who firmly advocated this. In this sense, this article is the most important among the Covenant articles, and it attaches great characteristics to the organization of the League of Nations. Although there are many international associations, there are no other groups besides the League of Nations that stipulate common sanctions against countries that violate the association's charter. The application of this sanction is not limited to the violation of specific provisions of the Covenant (refer to Article 16, paragraph 1). It goes without saying that applying it to the violation of general regulations is in line with the spirit of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(2) Resolutions of the League of Nations as a Guide to Interpreting Article 16: The League of Nations, in view of the imperfections of Article 16, the issue of its amendment or interpretation has long been a topic of discussion. The First League of Nations Assembly (1920) ordered the Council to establish an "International Committee on Blockade" to study the economic blockade issue in this article. The following year, the Second Assembly, after deliberation by various committees, adopted four draft amendments and a majority of interpretative resolutions. According to these proposals, they have not yet come into effect because they have not been sufficiently ratified (Article 26).</p>
<p>(3) Conditions for Applying Sanctions under Article 16:</p>
<p>A. Conditions for Economic and Military Measures (Article 16, Paragraph 1):</p>
<p>This sanction must be applied to "a member of the League of Nations that resorts to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 10, 12, or 15." However, economic and military measures are not the only necessary sanctions in the above situations. Violations of Articles 10, 11, paragraph 1, 12, paragraph 4, 17, paragraph 4, etc., may also be considered. Then, who decides whether the act of violating these regulations constitutes the so-called "war of aggression"? According to the explicit text of Article 16 and paragraph 4 of the Second League of Nations Assembly resolution, it is a matter to be clarified by each country of the League of Nations itself with its legal authority. However, the following points should be noted regarding this matter:</p>
<p>(1) The independent right of each country to exist lies in Article 16, and there is absolutely no arbitrary exception. If a League of Nations country obtains confirmation of a violation of Article 16, it has the obligation to apply the sanctions of this article.</p>
<p>(2) A difficult situation will arise when the League of Nations countries cannot agree on the issue of whether a violation of the Covenant exists (for example, Country A declares war and imposes sanctions because it believes that Country B is carrying out a war of aggression, but another country believes that Country A has violated the Covenant). The Second Assembly hoped that the Council would issue an opinion on this issue by a majority vote and hoped that all countries would act according to this opinion. However, because the opinion is not binding, each country can still take independent action arbitrarily without waiting for the Council to issue an opinion. As a result, especially when a member country opposes the majority opinion of the Council and determines that a violation of the Covenant exists, an extremely dangerous situation will inevitably arise. The shortcoming of this article lies in this.</p>
<p>B. Expulsion (Conditions of Article 16, Paragraph 4): The sanction of expulsion is different from economic and military measures. It can be exercised when a country intentionally violates the Covenant.</p>
<p>(4) Implementation of Sanctions A. General Situation</p>
<p>Article 16 stipulates economic blockade, military sanctions, and expulsion sanctions as methods of sanctions. There is no problem with the expulsion section, but there is no definitive discussion on the extent of economic and military sanctions that each country should implement against violating countries. Also, in relation to this, the severance of diplomatic relations must be considered. The text of Article 16, paragraph 1, leads people to speculate and interpret that as a result of a war of aggression, a state of war is automatically established between the aggressor country and the entire League of Nations. According to this view, the entire League of Nations immediately expresses a war-like attitude toward the violating country, and at the same time, diplomatic relations are naturally severed, and preparations are made to implement severe economic and military systems when necessary. However, several countries of the League of Nations found this interpretation most painful, and the drafters of this text were also afraid that they could not obtain a reliable belief that it could be implemented. Therefore, the Second Assembly interpreted the explicit text of this article as "the unilateral actions of the violating country do not create a state of war, its actions only declare the implementation of war acts, or there is a possibility of a state of war between the violating country and the League of Nations countries. However, in the League of Nations, at least preventing war and attempting to restore peace through economic pressure is an act in line with the spirit of the Covenant (Resolution 2)." If there is a violation of the Covenant, it is not necessary to immediately realize all the effects of the economic blockade. Lighter measures can be implemented first, and then gradually more severe measures (Resolution 14). It goes without saying that when League of Nations countries recognize the existence of a war of aggression, they must implement economic sanctions (Article 16), but according to Resolution 3 of the previous paragraph, the right to declare war on the violating country rests with each country. Therefore, there are League of Nations member countries that do not want to participate in the economic blockade or declare war against the violating country (whether diplomatic relations are severed at this time will be described in the charter). The Second Assembly recognized the delegation of economic sanctions to two countries and allowed certain countries, under certain conditions, to postpone participating in all or part of the economic measures (Resolution 9 and the additional protocol of Article 18, paragraph 4). Therefore, with the permission of the Council, even if it is known that there is a violation of the Covenant, one can not participate in sanction behavior. That is, according to the resolutions and amendments of the Second Assembly, the obligations stipulated in this article can be slightly reduced. In other words, violating the explicit text of the Covenant is in line with the spirit of the League of Nations (but because this resolution is not binding, each country can also assert the opposite interpretation). However, granting the right to declare war immediately to the League of Nations countries can be said to be extremely dangerous. We still hope that all countries will postpone action until the Council issues its opinion.</p>
<p>B. Severance of Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>(1) Diplomatic relations are naturally severed between the violating country and the League of Nations countries that declare war on it.</p>
<p>(2) League of Nations countries that do not declare war on the violating country also have the obligation to sever the following diplomatic relations to help ensure the absolute success of the economic blockade, but consular relations can continue (Resolution 12 of the Second Assembly).</p>
<p>(3) Sanctions against aggressor countries are carried out in the name of the League of Nations. Therefore, the League of Nations organs should also stop acting on behalf of the aggressor country, but the severance of diplomatic relations can be temporarily limited to recalling ambassadors or ministers (Resolution 11 of the Second Assembly). Also, people from violating countries who are staff members of the League of Nations Secretariat can remain in their original positions because they can be said to have renounced their nationality during their tenure.</p>
<p>C. The most important economic blockade among the sanctions stipulated in Article 16:</p>
<p>(1) The economic blockade in this article and the blockade under international law are different from the peacetime blockade or wartime blockade stipulated in traditional international laws and regulations.</p>
<p>That is, under traditional international law, there is no obligation under domestic law to prohibit this behavior. However, according to Article 16, it stipulates that each League of Nations country has a domestic legal obligation to prohibit its own citizens or merchant ships from communicating with the people of the violating country. Moreover, the League of Nations countries must prevent and suppress communication between the people of the violating country and other nationals. This kind of measure can be implemented on land or at sea, regardless of international laws and regulations. This is the difference from the so-called peacetime and wartime blockades. Therefore, there is no problem between League of Nations countries, but for non-League of Nations countries or League of Nations countries that do not recognize the continuation of the war of aggression and do not agree to apply the sanctions of Article 16, the blockade should be implemented based on general international law. Currently, peacetime blockades under international law cannot involve the ships of third countries, and for ships that violate blockade behavior, only the cargo can be detained, and the ship cannot be confiscated. Therefore, compared to wartime blockades, its effect is much less. Therefore, if the violating country has a maritime boundary, in order to achieve the complete purpose of the sanctions in this article, it is necessary to implement the economic blockade stipulated in this article and at the same time implement a wartime blockade. Also, the obligation stipulated in the latter part of Article 4, paragraph 1, to prevent and suppress financial, commercial, and personal communication between the violating country and all other countries cannot be exercised without implementing a wartime blockade. Therefore, even if the interpretation that the country that has taken the war of aggression and all other League of Nations countries are not in a state of war is established (refer to Chapter A above), the country participating in the economic blockade of the country with a maritime boundary must be in a state of war with that country.</p>
<p>(2) The time to start the economic blockade:</p>
<p>Article 16, paragraph 2 stipulates that all League of Nations countries should immediately sever all relations with the violating country. From the perspective of the original meaning of this item, each League of Nations country should start the economic blockade when it holds the firm view that there is a war of aggression, and should not wait for other countries to take this measure. However, for the success of the economic blockade, it is absolutely necessary for all countries to take unified action. Therefore, after the Council issues its opinion on the time, type, and degree of commencement of the economic blockade, each country can start action. The Second Assembly decided to revise this charter and stipulated that the Council should notify the League of Nations countries of the time for implementing economic sanctions (the third additional agreement), but the independent decision-making power of each country still exists.</p>
<p>Today's principle is that each country can start action at any time when it recognizes that there is a war of aggression.</p>
<p>(3) Measures taken by various countries regarding the economic blockade:</p>
<p>The latter part of Article 16, paragraph 1 stipulates that League of Nations countries should take measures to make the economic blockade effective against the violating country. According to this provision, any League of Nations country that recognizes a war of aggression must: (1) sever all commercial and financial relations between its own country and the violating country, (2) prohibit all communication between its own citizens and the citizens of the violating country, and (3) take active measures to prevent and suppress all commercial, financial, and personal relationships between other countries and the violating country.</p>
<p>The differences between rights and obligations and the rights and obligations of blockades under traditional international law have already been described. League of Nations countries must take domestic legislative measures to implement this obligation (Resolution 19 of the Second Assembly). Whether the above-mentioned (2) prohibition of communication should be implemented in the country of nationality or the country of residence is a major issue. The text of Article 16 seems to take the principle of nationality at first glance, but the Blockade Committee adopted the principle of residence, and the Second Assembly also adopted this claim (Resolution 13, the amendment to Article 16, paragraph 1). Therefore, residents of the blockading country and residents of the blockaded country shall not continue any relationship. However, imprisoning people from violating countries, detaining shops, and implementing actions should be prohibited. Later, the Fourth Congress decided to adopt the principle of residence as the principle, and League of Nations countries could arbitrarily use the principle of nationality at the same time, but these amendments have not come into effect. Therefore, it seems that League of Nations countries cannot be forced to implement the principle of residence under current law, but what should be most noted here is that the Second Assembly stipulated that each country does not have to immediately implement the most severe economic sanctions and can implement them in progressive steps (Resolution 14). Therefore, it is not necessary to immediately prevent all goods from being transported to the violating country, and it is possible to only prohibit the transportation of important items as a function of economic and military resistance.</p>
<p>(4) Cooperation between countries and the participation of non-member countries in economic blockade behavior:</p>
<p>When League of Nations countries implement Article 16, paragraph 3 regarding military and economic sanctions, they shall assist each other to avoid losses and keep them to a minimum. Regarding this kind of joint relationship between League of Nations countries, the Second Assembly requested that all countries accept the Council's advice, promise to undertake special tasks, and at the same time, for those countries that are severely affected by participating in joint sanction behavior, relax their participation or postpone it under certain conditions (Resolution 9 and the additional protocol of Article 4). The Council must strive to conclude agreements with non-League of Nations countries in order to cooperate (Resolution 17 of the Second Assembly), but it is impossible for the Council to conclude this kind of agreement with all non-League of Nations countries. Therefore, when implementing an economic blockade, it is also necessary to implement a wartime blockade at the same time.</p>
<p>D. Military Sanctions</p>
<p>The task of the League of Nations is to avoid declarations of war and military sanctions and restore peace through economic pressure (Resolution 3 of the Second Assembly). A declaration of war does not have to be combined with military measures. There are also declarations of war for demonstration purposes or to fully implement economic blockade behavior. For the application of military sanctions, the Council must propose to all League of Nations countries a system for the allocation of land, sea, and air forces by each country in accordance with Article 16, paragraph 2 to uphold the Covenant. This kind of proposal is also necessary in economic blockades and wartime (when wartime blockades are carried out at the same time). Each country shall participate in military sanctions to the extent necessary in principle, but the Council's proposal is not binding. Therefore, each country may refuse to participate in military sanctions with reasonable reasons, but this refusal does not deny the existence of legal restrictions. Although the League of Nations country that recognizes the war of aggression does not participate in military sanctions, it must allow the military of the country participating in military sanctions to pass through its territory, and it must also have the obligation to assist each other as stipulated in Article 16, paragraph 3. Therefore, this kind of League of Nations country does not have the rights and obligations of neutrality, but has a special position. All countries that oppose the violating country should act as organs of the League of Nations, and the League of Nations, in accordance with Article 11, considers the war between that League of Nations country and the violating country to be a matter of concern to the interests of the entire League of Nations and can intervene in this matter (according to the German international law scholar, Mr. Xijin).</p>
<p>E. Expulsion,</p>
<p>The expulsion sanction can only be implemented against the League of Nations country responsible for the war of aggression, but unless all the world's major countries participate in the League of Nations, the one who suffers the damage as a result of the expulsion is not the violating country but the League of Nations itself. The expulsion sanction cannot be implemented without the unanimous agreement of the Council (excluding the violating country).</p>
<p>(5) Expenses Required for Sanctions,</p>
<p>It is a matter of course that the violating country bears all the expenses required for its own actions and compensates for damages, but when various countries cannot fulfill this, the League of Nations bears the League of Nations' action expenses (especially military expenses), and each League of Nations country bears the losses suffered by each League of Nations country due to the economic blockade.</p>
<p>(6) Neutrality in Article 16</p>
<p>(1) Those who are completely neutral in the application of Article 16 are non-League of Nations countries that do not engage in wars of aggression and do not participate in sanctions.</p>
<p>(2) Although the League of Nations country does not declare war, it cannot be in a neutral position if it recognizes a war of aggression. It has a special measure, as described above. (3) What kind of position is a League of Nations country in that does not recognize a war of aggression and does not participate in the sanction behavior of Article 16? Whether these countries bear the obligations of Article 16, paragraph 3, is questionable. From the point of view of making the sanctions of the League of Nations easy to implement, if these countries bear their obligations, then their neutrality should also be restricted (according to Dr. Ritsuo Tateki). However, in the above sections (1 and 2), whether the violating country should willingly accept this neutral system is another matter. Also, when a non-League of Nations country refuses to accept the obligations of Article 17, paragraph 1 of the Covenant and wages war against a non-League of Nations country that accepts the opinions of the League of Nations (Article 17, paragraph 3), both countries are not bound by the Covenant as a result. All countries may demand that the League of Nations countries give up their neutrality, and the actions of the League of Nations countries in the above sections (1 and 2) violate neutrality.</p>
<p>(7) Conclusion (Difficulties in applying Article 16),</p>
<p>Although Article 16 is an important provision in the League of Nations Covenant, due to its specificity and the fact that the League of Nations does not have a worldwide nature, various difficulties arise when it is implemented. This can be roughly understood from the above-mentioned reasons. The application of this article has not been seen since the establishment of the League of Nations, because the one who suffers the damage is not the expelled country but the League of Nations itself. Although joint military sanctions seem powerful, it is impossible for the Council to decide on the number of land, sea, and air forces that each country should assume. Therefore, the initiation of sanctions under this article can be said to be absolutely impossible to realize. As for the most important economic blockade, it also seems difficult to implement for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The economic and financial damage caused by the economic blockade to the violating country is quite large, but at the same time, the countries participating in the economic sanctions also suffer great losses and inconvenience, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>(2) The economic blockade must be accompanied by a wartime blockade, but the difficulty in implementing this military sanction has also been described (because non-League of Nations countries will not sacrifice their freedom and endure losses and inconvenience to assist in economic sanctions).</p>
<p>(3) There are various difficulties due to the incompleteness of the prescribed methods, as described above. Namely, (1) each country has independent decision-making power to determine whether or not to violate the treaty and implement economic sanctions, and it is feared that unified action cannot be taken, and the League of Nations may abuse the sanctions of this article with malicious intent. (2) The principle of nationality clearly stipulated in Article 16, paragraph 1, is actually quite difficult to implement (the revised regulations advocating the principle of residence have not yet become binding). (3) Various difficult problems arise due to neutral relations, and mutual assistance between League of Nations countries is not possible.</p>

<p>(Chairman's Report) At precisely 10:00 AM, the meeting commenced as scheduled. Chairman Zheng reported that today marked the fifth drawing for redemption of the principal of the 20th Year of the Republic Short-Term Financial Public Bonds, the eleventh drawing for redemption of the principal of the 18th Year of the Republic Disbandment of Troops Bonds, and the second drawing for redemption of the principal of the 20th Year of the Republic Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds. He expressed his delight at the presence of the attendees. He then stated that the total issuance of the 20th Year of the Republic Short-Term Financial Public Bonds was 80 million yuan. With the first to fourth redemptions already drawn, this was the fifth redemption, with two lots to be drawn, each worth 80,000 yuan, totaling 160,000 yuan, which is two per thousand of the total issuance. Therefore, the lottery method would be to select bond tickets with the same last three digits. The total issuance of the 18th Year of the Republic Disbandment of Troops Public Bonds was 50 million yuan. With the first to tenth redemptions already drawn, this was the eleventh redemption, with one lot to be drawn, worth 500,000 yuan, which is one percent of the total issuance. Therefore, the lottery method would be to select bond tickets with the same last two digits. The actual issuance of the 20th Year of the Republic Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds was 6 million yuan. With the first redemption already drawn, this was the second redemption, with two lots to be drawn, worth 120,000 yuan, which is two percent of the total issuance. Therefore, the lottery method would be to select bond tickets with the same last two digits. For the three types of winning bond tickets, the 20th Year of the Republic Short-Term Financial Public Bonds and the 20th Year of the Republic Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds would be redeemed starting from the 15th of this month, and the 18th Year of the Republic Disbandment of Troops Public Bonds would be redeemed starting from the 30th of this month. Except for the Silk Industry Public Bonds, which would be paid through the Central, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and National Products Banks, the remaining bonds, together with accrued interest, would be paid by the Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. Payment would be made in national currency regardless of location. He requested that the supervisors inspect the lottery tickets and the ticket stubs to facilitate the lottery drawing.</p>
<p>(Winning Numbers) After the report, the chairman designated lottery drawers to conduct the lottery. Each drawn ticket was presented to the chairman for verification, and then to the supervisors for confirmation before the winning numbers were announced. The winning numbers are as follows: 20th Year of the Republic Short-Term Financial Public Bonds "194" "558", 18th Year of the Republic Disbandment of Troops Public Bonds "77", 20th Year of the Republic Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds "4" "44". The meeting adjourned at 11:15 AM after the drawing was completed.</p>

<h3 id="e268">Using Strengths to Overcome Weaknesses <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, in this current period, military affairs are of primary importance, followed by diplomacy. However, there is one weapon whose power and effectiveness is as important as military force, or even surpasses it. Unfortunately, it has not been used effectively. What is it? It is economics. China's economy lacks organization, but it still maintains its inherent rural socio-economic structure. Therefore, if a problem arises in one area, while other areas are inevitably affected, the overall situation will not be jeopardized. As such, when compared to Japan economically, China is actually superior and can maintain the spirit of individual economic independence. Japan's economy is a highly organized nation. Because of this organization, problems in one area often affect the entire situation. Therefore, China's lack of economic organization is a major drawback during peacetime, but it is now an advantage during this difficult time. In terms of military equipment, the gap between China and Japan is significant. However, in terms of economics, China's strengths offset Japan's weaknesses. The people of China should know themselves and their enemy, using their strengths to overcome the enemy's weaknesses. The method for this is to implement a boycott of Japanese goods and impose economic sanctions. The import of Japanese goods into China is as harmful as tanks and airplanes at Lu Fengkou and Shimenzhai. If the people of China advocate being the military's support, there is no other way to achieve this. This is far more effective than empty talk of saving the nation. Look at Germany's expulsion of Jews. Orders were issued and implemented immediately, with the whole nation in unison. Their spirit is admirable, due to their well-organized infrastructure. In China, it must be initiated voluntarily by the people to be effective. What is the point if the government leads, but the people remain indifferent? A friend of mine has not used Japanese goods for decades, for reasons I do not know, but if every Chinese person had this spirit, we could certainly bring Japan to its knees.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Direct Negotiations <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>As for direct negotiations, interactions between countries always involve direct negotiations. China and Japan can certainly engage in direct negotiations, but in the current situation between Japan and China, direct negotiations would require Japan to demand recognition of puppet organizations and various illegal demands. What negotiations would be possible then? In short, it is not that direct negotiations are not permissible, but that direct negotiations are not feasible. As for the progress of the League of Nations' advisory committee of twenty-two nations, it is still uncertain. The establishment of this committee is also dependent on the overall situation and how it evolves to determine the appropriate course of action.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Mandated Governance <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Germany and the United States' request for Japan to return mandated governance of the South Seas Islands has become less prominent, but it will eventually be resolved. Currently, it seems to be only Germany and the United States involved. However, due to Australia's relationship with the South Seas, the United Kingdom will inevitably intervene in this matter. Germany is temporarily not actively pursuing this issue due to the severity of its anti-Jewish policies. Once the anti-Jewish issue is resolved, it will then resolve this problem. It is difficult to say what the outcome will be, but if Mussolini's Four-Power Pact succeeds, it will be easily resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Declines to Serve as Minister of Justice <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, the Central government requested that I serve as the Minister of Justice. Although I heard this suggestion while in Beijing, I did not agree and have formally declined. Some may say that during this time of national crisis, everyone should join the effort. However, I am only willing to exert my effort in matters that are directly related to the national crisis. Additionally, I have already stated that I will not accept the position of Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee when I attended the Foreign Affairs Committee previously. I only agreed to serve as interim chairman. Recently, some people have written to me, addressing me directly as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which is a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Chamber of Commerce Urges Banks and Native Banks to Stop Lending to Treacherous Merchants <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>Advises Them to Persuade Fellow Businesses to Resolve Firmly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to banks and native banks, urging them to stop lending to treacherous merchants to facilitate the boycott of Japanese goods. The letter stated: "Regarding the fact that since the Shanghai ceasefire, Japanese aggression has intensified, the loss of territory has expanded, and the treacherous merchants who sell Japanese goods are becoming increasingly brazen, it is because the public lacks methods to restrain them, and so-called public opinion is not enough to move them. This chamber believes that to impose an economic blockade on the enemy, we must first impose an economic blockade on the treacherous merchants. Otherwise, it will be empty talk and only make us a laughingstock. We request that your association notify your members to investigate if any businesses that they have dealings with are secretly selling Japanese goods. Once such circumstances are discovered, they should immediately stop providing loans and recall any outstanding loans to warn the treacherous merchants. This is the most crucial task for saving the nation at present. We hope that you will sincerely persuade your fellow businesses to resolve firmly and diligently fulfill this task."</p>
<h3 id="e273">Municipal Government Investigates and Bans Inferior Coins <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>The Proliferation of Inferior Currency Hampers Social and Economic Development</p>
<p>Sends a Letter to the Jianghai Customs to Ban the Import of Inferior Coins</p>
<p>The Municipal Government received a letter from the Municipal Party Department, which forwarded a petition from the Fresh Pork Industry Association requesting an investigation and ban on inferior coins to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs requesting an investigation and ban on the import of inferior coins, and also instructed the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to handle the matter. The Municipal Party Department's letter and the Fresh Pork Industry Association's petition are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department's letter to the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang stated: "Regarding the Fresh Pork Industry Association's petition stating that the market is flooded with inferior coins, causing significant losses to merchants and requesting strict enforcement to alleviate their difficulties, this is because the proliferation of inferior coins in the market is detrimental to social and economic development. If strict measures are not taken, the public will suffer greatly. We are forwarding the original petition for your review and action."</p>
<p>The Fresh Meat Industry's Petition: The Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association petitions the Municipal Party Department, stating that the market is flooded with inferior coins, causing significant losses to merchants, and requesting an investigation and ban by the government authorities to alleviate their difficulties. Our association has received reports from members such as Yuan Chunyuan and others, stating that since the government's decision to change to the yuan system, currency unification and convenient calculation have greatly benefited merchants and the public. However, the multitude and inconsistent quality of silver coins are causing even greater harm. The principle that bad money drives out good money is a well-established economic principle. The current proliferation of inferior coins and the gradual reduction of good subsidiary currency in this city proves the validity of this statement. There are numerous types of subsidiary currency circulating in this city, totaling no fewer than twenty or thirty kinds. The silver content varies, and the market prices are inconsistent. Among them, there is a type of Xiamen official silver dollar that is universally accepted in the market. However, wholesalers and native banks require significant discounts and premiums. Merchants earn a significant amount of silver coins every day, and the so-called Xiamen official silver dollars often account for 60% to 70% of their earnings. Native banks display exchange rates, of course, based on good subsidiary currency, such as exchanging 1,230 coins for one small silver dollar. However, if exchanging Xiamen official silver dollars for silver, it requires exchanging 1,270 coins for one hundred yuan. There is no distinction when merchants use these coins, but they often lose two or three yuan per hundred when exchanging them. Other coins such as Dalian, Changsha, New Nine-Year, Eleven-Year, Thick-Edged, and Big-Bellied coins have many names and inconsistent prices. Fellow businesses suffer losses when exchanging them. If calculated annually, the amount of this unnecessary loss is not small. Merchants have been suffering losses for years and are in great distress. Therefore, we are sending this letter to your association to request that you forward it to the government authorities to investigate and ban inferior coins to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It seems that the current method should be to request the financial authorities to find a way to recover and recast these coins and to strictly investigate and ban their import to cut off their source. Once the source is cut off, inferior coins can be eliminated. Recovering and recasting coins can achieve a unified effect. Based on the report, we are preparing this document to be submitted to your association for review and to request that you forward it to the authorities to investigate and ban inferior coins to alleviate the merchants' difficulties for the public good.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Hongkou Pays Water Fees Based on Rent <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>One-Month Trial</p>
<p>The Shanghai Landlords' Association held a meeting at its office at 270 Beijing Road yesterday afternoon and decided to pay water fees at 7.5% of the rent, starting from April 1, for a one-month trial period to see if tenants are overusing tap water. If overuse continues and the water company implements a water meter system, tenants will be responsible for paying the increased water fees.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Third Batch of Antiquities Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Stored at the Former Site of Renji Hospital</p>
<p>The third batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum, along with antiquities from the Summer Palace and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, totaling 3,922 boxes, were transported on the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangda ship, escorted by Chen Rui, Councilor of the Executive Yuan, and Cheng Xingling, Secretary of the Palace Museum. They arrived in Shanghai at around 1:00 PM today and were docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau on Xin Kai River. They will be transported by the Maotai Transportation Company to the former site of Renji Hospital on Tianzhutang Street for storage.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Shao Lizi Discusses the Northwest and Firmly Declines the Governorship of Gansu <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Gansu-Suzhou Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and gave a lecture on the Northwest issue at the invitation of Jiaotong University. He will return to Nanjing within a day or two. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Shao at his residence this morning to inquire about whether the Central government has taken effective measures to provide relief to the Northwest. According to Mr. Shao, he discussed this issue with President Wang while in Nanjing, but no concrete measures have been taken. He has not been feeling well recently and is unable to handle the demanding workload. Furthermore, he is not suitable for politics, so he has decided to resign and will not return to his position. He is currently on a two-week leave and intends to personally request his resignation from the Central government during this leave, so that a more capable person can be appointed to save the Northwest. He hopes to contribute his opinions to the Central government at any time in his capacity as a private citizen.</p>
<h3 id="e277">The Xiyin Bookstore is Fined for Selling Obscene Books <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Harmful to Public Morality</p>
<p>On the afternoon of February 29th at 2:00 PM, Zhang Huiyou, a Chinese detective from the Old Zhabei Police Station, arrested Yang Honglin, a peddler selling obscene books, at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Beijiang Road. He confiscated 143 obscene books and handed them over to the First Special District Court, which sentenced Yang Honglin to a fine of fifty yuan. After investigation, it was learned that the obscene books were sold by the Xiyin Bookstore at 223 Gonghe Lane, Fuzhou Road. The police reported this to the First Special Court and obtained a search warrant. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they secretly searched the bookstore and confiscated 14 types of obscene books, including "Apricot Blossom Sky," "Sexual Perversion," "Male and Female Identification," and "Naked Woman," totaling 500 books. The owner of the bookstore, Zhou Guiting, was arrested and taken to the police station. This morning, he was handed over to the criminal court of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, the police lawyer, stated the facts of the case and requested that the defendant be punished in accordance with Article 251 of the Criminal Law to maintain public morality. After questioning the defendant, Judge Zhan Liangce sentenced him to a fine of one hundred yuan, and the 500 obscene books were confiscated.</p>

<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Human stupidity is an undeniable fact. Most people have long forgotten the tragic impressions of the 1914 Great War and are actively preparing for a second, even greater destruction. The combatants have already been deployed, waiting for the mobilization order.</p>
<p>Regarding the nature of this war and its combatants, let's listen to the confessions of the vanguard of imperialism:</p>
<p>"There are only two types of countries in the world today: capitalist countries (Britain, America, Japan, Italy, France) and communist countries (Soviet Russia). To resist Soviet Russia, China and Japan must unite and communicate with Britain, America, Italy, and France to understand their methods so that it can succeed." | See the secret agreement between Japan and the puppet "China Federation" as reported in the March 29th edition of the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>This slogan has already been proclaimed not only in the Far East but throughout the world.</p>
<p>Human stupidity and jealousy have existed since ancient times, but they are even more evident today. A pockmarked girl will always be jealous. Perhaps this is human instinct. The imperialist powers are riddled with holes that cannot be repaired. Seeing the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, they become even more envious and want to launch a final, desperate attack. This is a fate determined by history and is unavoidable because a new era must emerge from the old shell. People living in the old era cannot survive in the new world because they breathe differently and will inevitably commit suicide in the old world. This is the greatest tragedy caused by human stupidity. But what can you do for someone who voluntarily commits suicide, no matter how much compassion you have? The greatest compassion is to fulfill their wishes as soon as possible. Therefore, from a historical perspective and from the perspective of imperialism itself, this world war is not meaningless. The nature of this war has changed and taken on new elements. Unlike the previous wars between imperialist powers, this war is an international war on the vertical axis but a war between 125 million oppressed slaves and their rulers fighting for freedom on the horizontal axis. Therefore, it deserves our special attention.</p>
<p>But which group do we belong to? We must think carefully to decide our fate in this war. The fact is that you cannot hide on the sidelines and watch the excitement.</p>
<p>From the secret agreement between Japan and the puppet regime, it seems that Japan is willing to serve as the vanguard. To achieve a greater effect, China has been sacrificed under the "convenient arrangements" of this vanguard. But the importance of this supporting role cannot be denied. Feeling nominally isolated, they have created a fictitious "Chinese Federation Empire" as a source of spiritual comfort, which shows the difficulty of being a vanguard and the painstaking efforts of the invaders.</p>
<p>All of this is nonsense. In the end, the real decision lies in which path we are willing to take.</p>
<p>In the past (and perhaps still today), our esteemed country was prostrating before the throne of European and American imperialism. "China is now in love with Geneva," which even a cunning old fox like Lytton could see. A few years ago, we even tried to "lead the way," but the powerful foreigners were too merciless. Not only did they not show compassion, but they kicked him out of Geneva. As a result, the dream of occupying a seat at the bottom of the "Loyalty Hall" was finally shattered. But the innate nature cannot be changed, so we look westward, wandering like an abandoned woman, creating the chaotic phenomenon of the past few years. If you ask which group we belong to in this world, our answer is "unclassifiable."</p>
<p>First, it is clear that we are not a capitalist country, although we are constantly flirting with imperialism. There is still a slogan of "overthrowing imperialism" in the "Legacy" and we are being fiercely oppressed. But we are definitely not a socialist country. We are working hard on the "bandit suppression" movement. So, it is difficult to say which group we belong to. We are neither part of imperialism nor good friends with socialism. How can we survive in this world? What group do we belong to?</p>
<h3 id="e279">The Severity of the Problem <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>| Written to a friend named Ji Chou |</p>
<p>I have long wanted to write you this letter, but I do not know where you are now. At the edge of this world, I have been trampled into an abyss of ten thousand fathoms, and how did you encounter the same fate!</p>
<p>Lately, the goddess of spring has arrived in the world. Every morning, the sparse sunlight shines through the cracks in the east-facing window into my snail-sized living space. The thin bedding seems to ripple with warmth. Ah, the gifts of nature are still impartial. Afraid of wasting the grace of the sun, I excitedly jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>But it was at this moment that my feelings were triggered. The rich are still snuggling in warm beds, embracing women, dreaming of their paradise, because the times have favored them. Money is rolling around them. Another group is already starting their busy lives. To begin the day, the first thing is to hurry to the vegetable market with a bamboo basket, jostling and bustling, and who is not dreaming of ascending to heaven, building the foundation of personal comfort!</p>
<p>Having become a traitor to the masses, I cannot step into the circle of ordinary life. I can only recall: yesterday morning I didn't eat a sesame cake, and my stomach was very hungry. Today it is as normal as it should be! What does it matter! Even if there is no food for lunch or even dinner, what does it matter! Fundamentally speaking, in this society full of jackals and wolves, it is a blessing that we have not been devoured by them! I have recognized this, so every time I get hungry, I comfort myself this way.</p>
<p>But where is the problem?</p>
<p>I only want to say that there are so many things in this society that make us young people feel indignant and distressed. The surrounding environment, as reflected in our eyes, is a series of blows. Look, on that side, a group of people are using all kinds of vile tactics - flattery, arrogance, oppression, and sucking - to enjoy a life of luxury, consuming Lidu, living in high-rise buildings, not satisfied with the enjoyment, and constantly playing the game of harming others. On this side, a group of people are toiling and struggling all day long, but still freezing and starving, fully demonstrating the two vastly different worlds. This is such a hateful thing!</p>
<p>Look, the life of the entire nation is already in extreme danger. The loss of the Northeast, the humiliation of the Shanghai Incident, even if we don't talk about it, the Japanese warlords have blinded our authorities, who have no sense of national consciousness. Even more fiercely, they have occupied our Rehe. Although our country usually maintains an army of hundreds of thousands, they cannot resist a few hundred Japanese soldiers in battle. What is the reason? Is it really impossible to resist? Even a three-foot-tall child would not believe it, because of their own interests, because they are not determined to resist, so the Japanese soldiers can drive straight in, so our country has lost one province after another, so the nation is increasingly approaching the brink of destruction.</p>
<p>Are these not more serious than personal problems! As the ancient saying goes: "When the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" This has explained the meaning acutely.</p>
<p>Of course, pressing personal problems need to be solved urgently, but the key to this problem lies in the masses, in the entire nation. To solve personal problems, we must also solve the problems of the masses and the nation.</p>
<p>The wheels of time have crushed us into an abyss of ten thousand fathoms. Can we just let it crush us?</p>
<p>Just being pessimistic and negative is a sign of self-destruction. Rushing blindly is also useless. What we need is a kind of enzymatic strength. My friend, you are the backbone of our group. Although you have encountered the same fate, I am ashamed that I only have these feelings. Please give me a concrete answer!</p>
<p>Wish you well</p>
<p>Your brother Bing, March 22nd</p>

<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>The poet's heart is in his mouth, the prostitute's heart is in her genitals; simply because everyone regards the mouth as more precious than the genitals, they all worship the poet's heart and despise the prostitute's!</p>
<p>A lyric poet cannot speak of love without poetry, a prostitute cannot speak of love without sexual intercourse. Aren't these two kinds of love often expressed, but not true love?</p>
<p>What is the taste of love? The blood of a warrior and the tears of a prostitute, mixed with the semen of a man suffering from spermatorrhea!</p>
<p>The fallen leaves proudly think that autumn is called by them!</p>
<p>A manure cart overturned on the road. No crime, because it is impossible to tell whose manure it is!</p>
<p>A beautiful woman can kill not only men, but also women. If she comes to seduce her beloved husband.</p>
<p>Love is like eating melon seeds. When you don't want to eat them anymore, it's hard to let go.</p>
<p>When visiting a mountain, it often seems near but is actually far away, but sometimes when you objectively estimate it to be far, you arrive after just one turn. Perhaps this is the reason why love drives young people crazy!</p>
<p>A blind man: "I wish I weren't blind, even if I became deaf."</p>
<p>A deaf man: "I wish I weren't deaf, even if I became blind."</p>
<p>This is life!</p>
<p>Comparing a woman to a flower is the best analogy. When a gentle breeze brushes against her, she sways proudly, but when a strong wind comes, she silently submits.</p>
<p>The truth of deduction is nurtured, the truth of induction is collected, and the truth of dialectical clarification is fought for.</p>
<p>When a person is born, they create "their own world." In middle age, they create "their own children." In old age, they create "their own corpse." This is everyone's three-part creative work!</p>
<p>Railways are built for trains, roads are made for cars, and the sun is born for tall buildings!</p>
<p>The times are like ink. Without the ability to change the times, one first changes the pen tip. The color will not change!</p>
<p>People often say that trains are fast, but they don't know that their speed lies in the wheels!</p>
<p>The car body above the wheels forgets itself, as if it is flying!</p>
<p>There is no one who cherishes time less than the person who invented the clock, and also those who...</p>

<p>Killing a criminal, the tens of thousands of innocent sperm in his body die!</p>
<p>A man's love is water, a woman's love is a cup: when the water is gone, the cup is just empty, but anyone can fill it; when the cup is broken? The water flows freely without a place to go!</p>

<p>Shop Assistant Communications</p>
<h3 id="e281">A Gentleman Can Be Deceived With Propriety <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>After reading Miss Jin's "Can Love Simultaneously Accommodate Several People?" in the Shop Assistant Communications, two thoughts are deeply imprinted in my mind. First, male and female employees should respect each other's personality when working together. Second, the emerging female profession should be protected.</p>
<p>I have also heard that Miss Jin, so-called the "Queen," is suffering spiritually, but her so-called spiritual suffering is here, not there.</p>
<p>Because her appearance is relatively good, it has attracted the attention of a few male colleagues. Some write love letters to tease her, some pursue her after closing time, and some tease her at ordinary times, clinging to her like flies to carrion. But she always treats them with indifference, like water or ice, ignoring them completely.</p>
<p>Sitting at home, disaster comes from the sky. Because their goals are difficult to achieve, they come up with various methods to destroy and slander her. Recently, they have also impersonated Miss Jin to submit articles to your esteemed publication, in order to damage Miss Jin's reputation. At the same time, they also use the power of your esteemed publication to make the manager understand the misconduct of male and female colleagues, change the policy, and hope to reach the point of destroying the female profession. Their treacherous intentions can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Editor: A woman who doesn't even have the ability to choose a man, let alone judgment, cannot speak of the sanctity of love, let alone the female profession.</p>
<p>"I want bear's paw, and I also want fish." These two sentences insult women to the extreme. I wonder what Miss Jin, the real one, would think when she sees them.</p>
<p>I am an old colleague who has worked in the XX National Goods Company for more than ten years, and also a magistrate with children. I can no longer speak of love, let alone acidic reactions. However, for the sake of the future of the female profession, I have no choice but to speak out righteously. Please teach me, sir. If you think it still contains other motives, you might as well come to our company to investigate. I, Ge Zai, write again.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's note: After reading Mr. Ge's letter, we learned that the letter from Miss Jin that we published the day before yesterday was fabricated by her male colleagues. Moreover, the motive for fabricating this letter is extremely despicable. Here, we cannot help but express our deepest apologies to Miss Jin and Mr. Ge. We dare not hide our mistakes; therefore, today we specially publish Mr. Ge's letter here, hoping that people in society and the manager of Miss Jin's store will understand this fact and not fall for the tricks of this group of good-for-nothings.</p>
<p>It has been more than three months since this column was born. Looking back on these three months, we have tried our best to answer the questions of the shop assistants with all our wisdom and sincerity. We originally hoped to use this very meager power to relieve the pain of the shop assistants to some extent. Everyone who reads our communications every day can probably understand this spirit of serving society! Unexpectedly, "a gentleman can be deceived with propriety." Our good intentions have actually been used by these people, which is really heartbreaking to say. Finally, we have no choice but to borrow Mr. Ge's tone and shout loudly: I hope people in society will cherish this column that serves society.</p>

<h3 id="e282">Time in a Dream (Continuation of Twenty-One) <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Number sixteen was the last house in the alley, an Italian country-style building with a garden full of flowers. At the same time, someone was playing the piano inside the house. The bright and beautiful piano sound lightly crossed the half-closed gauze window and floated out leisurely, making Wu Yi stand outside the door, enjoying it freely, and he was too lazy to reach out and ring the doorbell.</p>
<p>"Old Wu! Why don't you go in?" Yu Lin happened to be coming back from outside, so he used the briefcase he was carrying in his hand to bump hard into Wu Yi, who was listening to the piano sound with all his attention.</p>
<p>"Ah! This piano is played so well..." Wu Yi praised as he followed Yu Lin into the house. At that time, the piano sound had stopped.</p>
<p>"Probably his wife is playing it!" Yu Lin walked in front, used the key to open the spring lock on the door, then turned sideways and let Wu Yi go in first.</p>
<p>Next to a large black piano stood a woman in a light green dress. She was petite, with a slightly round face, scarlet lips, and lively and bright eyes, clearly showing her extraordinary health and beauty.</p>
<p>"This is my wife, this is Old Wu! Haha! It's very interesting, Old Wu, you're seeing your matchmaker for the first time! Shouldn't you say thank you?" Yu Lin dropped the briefcase in his hand and lay down on a sofa, laughing excitedly.</p>
<p>Indeed, this was a very strange thing! Although Wu Yi and Yu Lin were the closest of old friends, he had never met his wife before today. The reason was not so abnormal, because when Wu Yi had just returned to the country, Ms. Mao Jufen was giving birth. After giving birth, she suffered a very serious illness and rested in the hospital for more than a year. Therefore, although she was the sole introducer of Wu Yi and Ms. Liu Suzhen's marriage, she was absent twice due to illness during the engagement and wedding. After she recovered from her illness, she had visited Wu Yi's residence several times, but she always went in the morning, when Wu Yi was sound asleep, so of course they couldn't meet. In the middle, she went to Tianjin for six or seven months to visit her aunt. With these three reasons, Wu Yi and her were like playing hide-and-seek, always missing each other.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law!" Wu Yi first greeted her respectfully, according to custom.</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Wu, I often wanted to see you, but it was always not coincidental! It's so interesting that we only met today!" Although Ms. Mao was already a mother who had given birth to a child, her age was only twenty-four, much younger than Wu Yi and Yu Lin. Therefore, she still fully retained her innocence, spoke more crisply than Yu Lin, and her attitude was of course more generous than every woman.</p>
<p>Wu Yi also felt that this meeting today was very peculiar and interesting, and a satisfied smile appeared on his face. "Mr. Wu! The 'Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Spicy' section you write in the Star Daily is really both humorous and profound. I really don't know how you come up with it!" Ms. Mao leaned on a swivel chair next to Wu Yi's seat and expressed her admiration to him very warmly, as if they were old friends who had been separated for many years, and once they met, they had endless words to pour out. "I heard Sister Suzhen say that you put a lot of thought into it and often put down your bowl suddenly while eating; indeed, writing is very hard, and it's even harder to write well. People who read it think it's interesting, but they never know how much effort the writer puts in!"</p>
