<h3 id="c22">華北停戰協定簽字　信 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>華北危急聲中。軍事的和平諒解傳佈多時。以形勢所格。報紙殊無揭載之自由。未能給讀者以充分滿足之紀錄。衷心誠多歉仄。今停戰恊定之簽字已公布於報紙。在此恐慌動搖之時。得和平喘息之機。與人民以來蘇之望。吾人雖痛感來日方長。難關正多。但於當局之委曲求全。亦當深諒其苦心。惟此次軍事恊定。其和平僅限於軍事的休戰。究竟此種和局。能保持至若干時日。匪特吾輩不敢豫測。即我國當局。恐亦將中心惴惴。而不敢遽抱樂觀也。</p>
<p>第一。九一八事變發生以來。舉世皆知日本爲直接之主動者。我國本其和平初衷。一再訴之國際聯盟。以求公理正義之伸張。結果雖得十三對一及四十二對一兩次道德上之勝利。然實際上則錦州熱河。繼東北三省而失陷。此次軍事恊定之對手。其他表固爲日本參謀本部所直接指揮之關東軍副參謀長岡村寗次少將。而其所代表之名義。則爲關東司令。日本駐華公使館書記官。僅居顧問地位較之上海中日兩國軍事協定。其不同之處。在於華北軍事當局與關東軍及中國與日本兩相對立。其輕重固不相同。而此次華北關係尤重於上海。物質上損失與領士人民之被蹂躪。亦不可以同日語。</p>
<p>第二。我國軍隊「須撤退至延慶·昌平·高麗營·順義。通縣。香河·寳坻·林亭口·寗河·蘆台·所連之線以西以南地區。」「日軍得以軍用飛機或他方法視察。」我軍之撤退。又須日軍確認已撤至上述地區而中不「續行追擊時」方「自動的歸還長城之線。」吾人所深爲悼惜者。即我國軍隊在自已領土以内之行動。而竟受此限制且須受敵方飛機之監察。日本軍隊則云。「自動的歸還長城之線。」不識究是誰家領土。如論日軍歸還。其領土界限。不能如是含混不明。蓋如此恐足遺後來之糾紛也。</p>
<p>第三。華北停戰協定在塘沽大孤商船會社簽字後。雙方互舉香濱以祝協定之成功。慶和平这有望。在日本關東軍方面。固當舉盃微笑念其不世之功績。收效之迅速。而在我國代表飲此一盃。設念及華北人民之困苦流離。殆不知是涙是血也又據日本關東軍代表岡村於簽字後述懷。乃謂「…這回直接近衝。迅速解决實在是痛快。不消說關東軍暫時還要監視中國方面是否遵守本恊定…」云云。我國代表讀此。不知作何感想。吾人所引以爲懼者。不在現時之暫安而在將來之隱患也。</p>
<p>第四。我國内「杭日剿共」「精誠團結。」已成一致通行之口號細審實際則又不無疑懼。西南各中委所發議論。與夫馮玉祥氏之主張吾人雖不獲細論其内容。然觀於上海特别市執行委員陷電勸告。以爲西南諸委員「遠處粤南空言抗日。…徒以挑撥手段。散發謠言。沮喪剿赤軍人勇離間抗日將士感情。抱隔岸觀火之心爲幸災樂禍之謀…自毁民族立場…影響外交…」同時勸告香港胡展堂氏之語。有「－先生態度曖昧行動消極不知者必以爲出於先生之指使。…「國仇猶自可私恨最難消」明社之屋實生於此則信乎國事之不可爲矣。…」則知在此外患正亟内憂未已之時黨國先進領袖。平日以老成謀國自命。又以「精誠團結」號召天下。而况不能「團結」禦侮至不惜「自毁民族立場。」幾何而不爲「仇者所快耶。」</p>
<p>華北軍事雖以停戰恊定成立。暫告一段落。而日本方面。尙高倡「監視」行動。則樂觀前途之實現。尙屬遙遠。况四百三十五萬方里之陳北四省仍爲外力所强制。即使華北粗安。我國民亦豈能終於默爾。各領袖亦寗不顧慮及之耶。此吾所以憂慮懷懼而不能已於言者也。</p>

<p>（四）一年來之工作成績</p>
<p>該區開辦以來、及今適届一年、回顧此一年中、究竟有無相當成績、其成績如何、此爲吾人所亟欲知者、茲將該區一年來辦理成績、略述如次、（一）借貸處當借貸處成立之始、一般農民因久困於地主階級重利剝削壓迫之下、爲積威所刦、對於借貸處存一種不可名狀的欵懼心理、該區於三月中派人赴農村宣傳放借時、農民以爲又是官廳驅人把戲、或是惡辣的害人政策、皆相率不敢嘗試、宣傳員欲其簽名志願書、更絕對辦不到、迨後無意中有在區内作短工之工人數人、缺少用欵向借貸處借貸、借貸處按照手續借給、利率一分、自有此事爲之開端、農民始對借欵屬發生信仰、不出十日、農民絡繹前來請求貸欵者達數百人、有借百元者、有借五十元者、有借三十元者、僅十日之間、卽已貸出三萬元、由此丨端、吾人可見農民受高利貸與地方勢力壓迫之深、低利貸欵、在農村双是何等急切需要、農民向借貸處借欵、例須先經一番調查、即其需要程度如何、用途又是否正當、而定貸欵額之多少、歸還之期、則在秋收以後、農民信用極佳、百分之九十五於期前卽行如數師還、百分之五則到期如行師還、記者前往參觀時、正在貸认第三期貸欵、惜貸處所充滿者、盡是農民、莫不欣欣然有喜色、該處辦事員辦事極認眞、農民借欵、必先經改善經濟組織所主任親口當面查詢、當面决定、平時該主任常自背一小包、親赴鄕村中調查、日暮即宿農家草雄上、絕不以爲苦、該主任曾留學日本、亦一熱心之實行家也、又借貸處之倉庫、已經動工建築、不久卽將完成、本届秋收之際、農民當可利用該倉庫以儲穀矣、</p>
<p>（二）開荒　荒地開墾、在沙塘已成立一中心農塲、與一園藝塲、面積僅千畝、石碑砰方面已開墾者有三千畝、近來正用汽油耕地機八架、儘盡開墾、不久當可達萬畝以上、無憂方面、已開墾之水田、有千畝左右、總計該區一年來開墾之荒地、除造林不在内外、約達五千畝、尙不及預这墾地二十分之一、今後正當加緊墾植、</p>
<p>（三）水利　關於水利、該區有甚大之計劃、廣西河道、多係石床水流甚湍激、如稍加人工、即可利一毅人大都不易輕信、故該區現正着手利用水力之設施、其計劃擬於河流築壩、增高水位、然後利用水勢、装置馬達、該區對於此事非注意初步規模、已略有眉目、如計劃一旦實現、不獨對於農村生産將有急劇發展、且將爲廣西農業工業化開一新紀元、其前途誠未可限量也、</p>
<p>（四）交通　農村生產發達、交通自屬重要、關於此點、該區已及早注意、現在已築成之汽車公路、約有七十里、田間汽路亦有五十里、運輸方面、頗增不少便利、此外柳城之河道、亦足爲運輸之助、</p>

<p>爲戰爭勝敗之主動力、」一二八及華北抗日軍事、皆以無空軍失敗、故鞏固國防、必須發展航空、尤須政府與人民通力合作、上海市民在吳市長領導之下、上海號飛機、即爲合作表現之初步、更望民衆踴躍輸將、俾飛機自第一隊擴充至十隊數十隊、以資全國航空建設、早日觀成、空、政府有此十八架飛機、可編成一中隊、希望各省市民衆、聞風興起、各捐贈一中隊之隊機、以促成航空建設、俾在最短期内、可以抵抗敵人、惟此項責任、全賴大衆之力、尤非口頭所能爲、應從實際表現才是云云、</p>

<p>思義、痛念國難、自應澈底認識、今日命名典禮深刻偉大之意義、而思有所奮勉也、惟是歐戰以還、空軍已爲現代國防計劃之中心、世界列强、無不集中財力、集中國力、從事於空軍之建設、統計各國現有空軍之實力、飛機之數量、多則萬餘架、少則數千架、彼此相較、强弱立判、則吾人又何能以此區區數架、遽爾自滿、而正應深自警惕、亟起直追、繼續努力、以完成救國之大業也、語云、「作始也簡、將畢也鉅」、吾人雖不能自滿、亦無庸其自餒、民族存亡、國運興替、唯視國人今後之努力如保而已、</p>
<p>市長揭旗</p>
<p>上海市號　飛機機身漆棕色、機翼爲黄色、機身中部有美國寇蒂斯公司鷹式字樣、頭部及兩翼均覆有黨國旗吳市長演說畢後、即偕夫人下主席台、在機前分左右立、並有甘恕先張桂卿兩小姐分立左右翼前、吳市長復作簡單演說、即將覆於飛機頭部黨國旗揭下、同時甘張兩小姐亦各揭開左右翼之黨國旗、而命名禮乃告終、</p>

<p>表演絕技</p>
<p>授受機禮畢、即由吳市長夫人行擲瓶昇空禮、將香檳酒瓶、向飛機頭部發動機輕輕一擲、香檳四溢、萬衆歡呼、三時十五分、杜禮特少校結束登機、拔動發動機後即駕機昇空、（一）首先高飛至萬餘尺、然後漸次下降、作直落直昇之表演、（二）在高空作各種旋轉倒翻之表演、（三）復下降作側飛倒飛緩飛急飛之表演、（四）作落葉式飄蕩上升下降之表演、毫無聲息、（五）作銳角轉灣式之飛行（六）作機體向下倒跌式之飛行、表演約二十分鐘、始飄然下降、其飛行術確已登峯造極、驚人絕技、萬衆讚諹、表演至驚險處、莫不爲之昨舌、及其化險爲夷、直升高空、則又爲之頓足呌絕矣、</p>
<p>躍空表演</p>
<p>杜氏表演畢、即由美國宼蒂斯公司另備練習機一架、機翼亦作黄色、惟前後可乘二人、由美飛行家羅意思駕駛、杜夕遜表演安全傘躍空下降、練習機先低飛繞場一匝、並在空中散飛鮮花、表示慶祝航空救國之成功、最後乃高飛至五千餘尺處、杜氏背縳安全傘、由高空一躍而下、安全傘即滿張飄蕩下降、姿勢絕美、掌聲不絕如雷、未幾即安全降落於跑馬場上、至四時正、各種表演告終、乃奏樂散會、</p>
<p>飛返龍華</p>
<p>空中表演畢、奏樂散會後、杜禮特少校仍駕上海市號機返龍華飛機場停置、據中央接收該機專員航空署長葛敬恩語記者、上海市號機接收後、暫在龍華機場停置二三日後、再由飛機廠長沈德爕、駕駛至杭州、俟全部改漆竣事、即飛往南京、編入空軍、本人在滬稍作勾留、或即乘該機返杭云云、</p>
<p>市長談話</p>
<p>杜禮特少校　正在空中表演絕技時、記者趨詢吳市長以訂購之價格、據答、航空協會向美國宼蒂斯公司訂購鷹式驅逐機十八架、約合美金四十萬零數千元目下美金價値稍低、故約折合華幣一百七八十萬元、每架枰均價格在十萬元左右、其餘之十七架、約八月中旬以前、陸續運抵滬上、又當杜夕遜氏表演安全傘下降、姿勢絕美、吳市長亦拍手讚絕、顧謂記者、安全傘表演、至爲冒險、非富有經騐者不辦、安全傘每頂之價格、約爲美金二千元云云、</p>
<p>一機受損</p>
<p>當宼蒂斯公司之練習機在塲表演第一幕完竣後、於三時五十分時、由跑馬塲西端下降、將及地面、不過三四尺之際、突然不愼、致機輪觸及於跑馬道之低欄、於是該機前進、受此阻碍、右機輪立即折斷、該機亦即墮地、一時觀衆、大驚譁起、紛紛趨前探視、而中委孔祥熙氏及市長吳鐵城氏等、聞聲亦即前往、此時駕駛者羅意思君、業已含笑躍出機外、吳孔兩氏、立即趨前握手慰問、詢其受傷否、羅意思君含笑曰否、遂檢視機體、除右輪折墮塲畔小河中外、餘無所損、於是衆始稍慰、</p>
<p>碾斃一人</p>
<p>飛機去後、觀衆紛散、江灣道上、更爲擁擠、四時五十分、在江灣路與體育會路之轉角、一十餘歲之鄕音、於擁擠中爲公共汽車所碾傷、隨即斃命、</p>
<h3 id="c81">黄紹雄昨抵滬 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>談華北情况</p>
<p>及停戰交涉</p>
<p>中央社云、内政部長黄紹雄氏、昨晨由京抵滬、即返西愛咸斯路新寓休息、中央社記者、往詢以關於華北近狀及中日停戰協定簽字之經過等、承答甚詳、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>中央將發宣言</p>
<p>黄氏謂、本人此次南下赴潯、曾在廬山會議席上、報告華北最近實况、但未參與會議、故會議詳情、本人未悉、惟據本人所知、中日停戰協定簽字後、中央將於日内發表一種宣言、詳細報告中日停戰簽字經過、俾全國上下、得以完全明瞭、</p>
<p>恊定未涉政治</p>
<p>停戰恊定、業已正式簽字、該項恊商經過、據本人所悉、雙方代表、盡係軍人、無政治代表列席、討論範圍、僅及軍事、未涉政治、駐平政務、整理委員會委員長黄庸白氏、對於停戰談判、僅處於協助地位、未參加協商、外傳云云、均屬揣測、協定第一項規定、中國軍即撤退延慶·昌平·高麗營·順義·通州·香河·寳坻·林亭·寗河·蘆台·所連之線、以西以南地區、不得前進云云、實則上述地點、其大部昌爲日軍佔據、至於長城以南、約百里左右地方治安、由地方當局、以警力維持之、</p>
<p>東北問題未談</p>
<p>停戰交涉至此已告結束、外傳停戰交涉分兩步進行、第一步係屬軍事性質、第二步則屬政治性質、此說本人未所聞、此次停戰交涉、對於東北問題、並未談及將來中日兩國、或將另行交涉解决中日間懸案、此則本人不敢加以預測、但關於華北停戰交涉、目前已告結束、並無所謂一第二步」之交涉、</p>
<p>今後三種希望</p>
<p>黄氏又謂、我軍因作戰工具遠不如敵、故雖拚死抵抗、迄未達到收回失地目的、迫不得已、協商停戰、現戰事暫告段落、今後惟有希望、（一）整頓軍務、因我軍軍機盡屬舊式、甚至以大刀與砲火相搏、勝負不戰可知、故非立即整頓、實不足以抗强敵、（二）上下團結、現我國人心散漫、實足以招外侮、欲决心抗敵、非上下團結下可、（三）認識國家、國人當明白政府措施意旨、上下團結、方可實現、上述三項、希望政府與人民共同注意、</p>
<p>抗日不尙空談</p>
<p>中委馮玉祥近通電就民衆抗日同盟軍總司令、黄謂、中央態度若何、本人未悉、廬山會議中曾否提出討論、亦未知其詳、總之抗日工作、在實行不在高唱口號、再者馮氏果决心抗日、何不早日實行、而待抗日各軍均已焦頭爛額、無力作戰之際、始行動員、似嫌過遲、察哈爾之情形、目前異常混亂、察省宋主席、刻正救傷卹死不暇、而馮氏擅行將察省主席更調、實屬令人不解、黄氏對於西南問題、不欲有所發表、何日再行北上、亦未决定、惟悉黄氏在滬、約有二三日勾留云、</p>

<p>災民三百餘萬</p>
<p>農村瀕於消滅</p>
<p>非有鉅大欵項</p>
<p>不克拯此奇災</p>
<p>樂善好施之士盍興乎來</p>
<p>陜西省之旱災、自民國址七年始、五年以來、迄未甦息、災情之慘烈、蓋爲亘古所罕見、本埠華洋義振會雖屢次匯欵振災、然報災之電、依然雪片而來、該會深感無法措手、爰於五月十三日、派副會長顧吉生君、偕同總幹事歐永康君等、赴陜調查、茲顧歡等已於日前返滬、報告調查所得之災况如下、</p>
<p>歷年災况　該省於民國十七年起、大旱三年、赤地千里、顆粒無收、農民本鮮蓋藏、經三年之久、遂致無可收拾、災情以關中西區一帶爲最重、東區次之、陜北又次之、其初尙可以草根樹皮、苟延殘喘、權則並草根樹皮而無之、餓死者遂不知凡幾、各方雖有振災之欵、然災重欵絀、杯水車薪、無濟於事、據當局調查、全省嗷嗷待哺之災民、達　三百三十四萬五千餘人之多、佔全省人口五分之三、所謂哀鴻遍野者、陜災眞名符其實矣、</p>
<p>本年災况</p>
<p>本年初春、復遭亢旱、所種麥苗、已瀕垂絕之境、幸而暮春三月、甘霖沛降、將萎之麥苗、乃復欣欣向榮、滿望夏收有有期、可以稍甦涸轍之鮒、不料四月底五月初、正是麥穗結實之際、乃狂風驜至、走石飛沙、溫暖之氣候、一變而爲嚴寒、又復迭降黑霜、霜之所至、莖葉皆枯、於是一線生機、依然斷絕、渭北十餘縣、仍是顆粒無收矣、農民罹此奇厄、災聲載道、求活不能、因而有自縊於田間者、嗚呼慘矣、</p>
<p>農村慘况　陜省農村、原極繁盛、自大旱以來、非但農村破產、直是農村消滅、其初尙期望來年之或可轉歡爲豐、忍死以待、不料來年旱狀、有增無减、三四年後、死者遂多、其中餓死者固大部份、而死於疫者亦復不少、夏令疫作、一人旣死、委諸野地、則　剝其衣、而疫遂蔓延不可收拾、全家死疫者、不一而足、於是少壯有力者、均紛紛流亡外出、現在災重之區、往往一村之中、有人者不過五六家、而殘留之人、亦皆奄奄垂斃、出售人口、已屬常事、已嫁女子、每口二元、未嫁者亦僅十三元耳、農家本無長物、人口　盡、則惟有木料猶可易錢、乃不顧一切、拔橡卸枉、以延旦夕之生命、農具票爲農人之生命線、不得已亦賤値出售、目下西安城中、列肆售此舊木料舊農器者、觸目皆是、故今年夏秋之際、卽幸而不再亢旱、而農民籽種全無、農具全無、亦無法耕種、農村慘况、一至於斯、誠浩刼也、</p>
<p>災重欵絀　災情之重、略如上述、欲求挽救、異常棘手、第一先須延彼未死者之生命、大抵每人得二三元、即可度一兩月、値雖甚廉、然災民奇多、非有鉅欵不辦、第二當購備籽種與農具、使農民仍得進行其工作、否則天公卽使時降甘霖、農民亦惟有望而嘆息耳、在災地奇廣、尤非有鉅欵不辦、顧君等雖在西安時、會急電該會、匯欵萬元、廣收農具、以濟一時之急、但區區之數、焉能濟事、深望有樂善好施之士、慷慨解囊、踴躍捐欵、集成鉅數、而後陜災得以稍紓、陜民生機、可望不絕也、</p>
<p>涇惠工程　陜省地勢高亢、水利不修、農人生計、悉賴於天、天不降雨、便屬死數、然森林旣鮮、舊有樹木、有伐無植、天雨之可能性、遂與日俱減、西人某氏、預測陜省將來或變爲沙漠之區、此雖不足盡信、然未嘗無此恐怖也、治本之道、莫要於興修月利、使農田灌漑有資、此涇惠渠工程之以重要也、目下涇惠渠工程、已達十之八九、灌漑田畝百萬以上、但原擬開闢各支渠、如果克底於成、較之已開渠工灌田多至三四百萬畝、今以欵絀無從進行、有人接洽、請華洋義振會撥欵担任開築支渠者、其費約十餘萬元、該會未嘗無担任之意、但欵猶無着、不知能募得到否、則亦有賴於慈善家之憫此鉅災樂輸鉅欵也、</p>

<p>復紹興周民安君來函</p>
<p>答：足下所問的兩個問題、答復如下：（一）你的境遇困難，餬口不暇，論理很難有求學的機會。但是這是就一般的常情而言、若眞能利用環境，隨時隨地皆可以求學，不必一定要進中學，進大學。進中學，大學的靑年，都是中產階級以上的人家的子弟，你這樣的寒酸靑年自然没有分。然而正因爲此、窮人子弟所獲得的各識與敎育、才有異常豐富的内容。譬如，窮人子弟隢得没有錢不能讀書的苦、就可因而覺悟到：要想使窮人子弟都有書讀，那就非對於使窮人之所以窮的社會根源，努力做改造的工作不可；又譬如、窮人子弟在鄕間看見了，並且身受了土豪劣紳，貪官汚吏的魚肉剝削，就　可因而覺悟到：要使農民免除痛苦，那就非根本改造農村不可。凡此種種，皆是中學大學的學生在敎室中或書本中所絕對得不到的知識與敎育。而在一個非常時代的人民文化程度，尤其是革命者的文化程度，是不能拿學校敎育做尺度，而是要以他的社會生活之進步的歷程，做水準的。說到這兒，我要請你鼓起勇氣。你是能以求學的，但是這種學問不是在學校中去求而是要在社會生活之日常鬭爭中去求。這是第一個問題。（二）「平津危急」，與其自殺，不如投軍，這種辦法在下述的條件之下是可以幹的，即：一、這種軍隊的組織者與指揮者以及其平素敎育訓練眞具有一個反帝國主義，保衛國家的革命精神，並且有堅决的行動。二、不然的話，投軍者就要有一種深謀遠慮，忠勇堅貞，所謂「遺大投艱」，所謂「盤根錯節」。所投之軍而眞能堅决地抵抗，則免胃笙衝鋒，慷慨赴死，以血　外敵，喚起國魂，宜也。所投之軍而非革命軍隊，乃是見敵而逃，那就結合民衆與帝國主義者的侵略軍作殊死戰。一八七一年的巴黎市民所給我們的英勇偉大的敎育，昭昭大人耳目。雖粉身碎骨，死亦瞑目，亦宜也。但是現在北方已經談判停戰，進行和平運動，你這股兒的憤氣也可以暫且平平。並望你平心想一想，睜開眼睛看看事實，不要無辜地去白送死！</p>

<p>吳鐵城、紀錄余文偉、司儀彭去疾、行禮如儀、前由吳市長到訓詞、繼潘李兩局長報告籌備經過、末由來賓海防檢疫處主任伍連德及衛生署朱季靑等相繼演說、至十一時許始攝影散會、</p>
<p>市長訓詞　吳市長訓詞略謂　諸君今天是上海市第一次舉行健康敎育展覧會、到會參加典禮的多半是靑年學生、可見中國靑年很注意健康敎育、孫中山先生說「我們中國人是靠天吃飯」、這句話拿中國近百年來一個積弱不振的大毛病都說了出來、中國俗語也說「閻王要你三更死、一定逃不過三更」、把我們一生的禍福疾病痛苦連國家的興亡、都委之天命、好像眞有個主宰之神在支配我們人生的整個生活、致中國在這八九十年中各種事業都受了靠天吃飯的影響、此次日人以武力壓迫中國、佔領我國領土、中國人的舊思想都說這是國家的定數、拿國家的命運也委之於天、使人的本分的力量没有完全表現出來、致中國各種事業莠靡不振、這是最危險的現象、也是我們熟心救國者所非常痛心而要想法革除此思想的、我們相信一個人自已有力量可以抵抗我們的環境、支配我們的生活、但其中最要緊的就是健康、我們身體之强弱、壽命之長短、都是人爲而不是靠天的、自已應先求本人的健康、古今中外大事業家·大政治家·大思想家·其成功的要點、全在他的健康勝過常人、所以我們要想個人和公共事業之成功、須先求健康、要求本人的健康、除充分的受健康敎育、衛生智識外、同時要把過去靠天吃飯之舊思想革除、中國的命運、中華民族的命運、我們個人的命運、都操諸自已、並非靠天的、諸君都是靑年學生、將來中國的責任在諸君身上、故現在應注意你們的健康、預備將來擔負國家大任、</p>
<p>局長報告　敎局潘局長報告略謂、今天舉行之健康敎育展覧會、不過本年度健康敎育活動中之一種、此會是由健康敎育委員會擔任籌備、共分展覧表演兩大部份、展覧方面分學校社會參考三組、學校出品都是市立及已立案私立中小學校的、其市立學校指定參加者有二十四校、自由參加者一百八十餘校、中學有九校、社會組除學校外、社會團體也有參加、參考組是專供研究之出品、總計此次參加展覧品共一萬二千餘件、以出品過多、故增設第二會場於倉基小學、表演力面、有各種兒童衛生活動表演、同時並爲兒童沐浴·種痘·檢查牙齒等各項工作、都是由衛生局方面擔任的、此次展覧會之意義、並不是以展覧一次就完了、是要使展覧過後、凡是到會的人都能知道其意義而注意個人及公共的衛生云、次衛生局李局報告略謂、健康二字對個及國家都有密切關係、健康敎育展覧會是敎衛兩局在市長指導之下組織的、於二月一日成立、籌備至今方開始展覧、其意義頗爲重要盼望本市市民參觀後、以所得的影象去實行、此次果然是上海第一次舉行、我們除盼望逐年舉行外、並盼望將來舉行全國的大規模的展覧會云、</p>
<p>來賓演說　内政部衛生署代表朱李靑演說、略謂公共衛生在世界各國都是進步得很快、但都是用法律或者是改良環境方面着手進行的、但實行結果、發種種困難、關於個人的衛生法律旣不能裁制、環境亦無法改良、所以現在大家想從敎育方面入手、中國自十六年以來、衛生事業及衛生運動宣傳得很多、但健康是要求實行的、不是形式的、此次展覧會除展覧外、尙有種痘等等工作、就是一方面求知、一方面實行云、末由海防檢疫處主任伍連德演說、</p>

<h3 id="c140">新近蘇俄中小學課程及敎育行政上之改革（二）朱鎭蓀 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>三、敎授工作和訓育之改進</p>
<p>自一九三一年九月五日的改進課程案通過以後、在中小學校敎授工作方面亦有巨大的進步、當時中央委員會雖令各校不許採用任何方法作爲基本敎授法、可是實際上許多學校都已採用所謂强迫的團體實騐敎授法了、因此不但敎師的任務被其縮至極低的限度、並且忽略每個學生的個别作業、所以蘇俄共產黨中央委員會請求各共各國中的敎育委員會糾正這種方法所產生之錯誤、並根據以下原則重新組織學校中的敎授工作、</p>
<p>（一）中小學校應一律採用課室中的誦讀法、這種誦讀應依照課程表中所排定之科自和指定之學生人數的、此種敎授方法在團體與個别敎授中都可採用、</p>
<p>（二）敎師應當用有系統的方法訓練學生應用課本、他們還須鼓勵學生在研究室·實騐室及商疚中獨立工作、他們須領導學生參觀工廠、博物院農塲、森林等地方當他們預備帮助學生解决困難問題時、應鼓勵他們對於解决問題·作文·造模型·實騐·以及搜集材料等工作應該自已獨立去幹、共產黨中央委員會還請敎育委員會予敎學人員一學校工作領袖之特權、</p>
<p>（三）每個學生的個别作業記戰可作爲學業成績之根據、敎師對於每個學生應作詳細之研究、並且在每學期終了、於每種指定的科目上、他須預備每個學生約成績單、在每學年的結束時、所有學生須一律參加大考、</p>
<p>（四）敎育委員會應於最短時期内規定各種訓練工作和適合學生年齡的實騐室中農塲中、和工廠中工作的適當方法、</p>
<p>（五）已往學校中的行政人員和敎師對於破壞學校的秩序的問題、是不注意的、且對於提倡有組織的訓練、亦不努力、但現在學校中的校長和敎師對於維持學校中的紀律都應負重大的責任、爲了這種目的、所以他們須與社會上的團體、學生的家長、以及靑年共產黨先鋒隊合作、凡侮辱師長違犯學校規章、以及毁壞學校校具的怙惡不悛、學生、應一律被開除、並在一年至三年之内、無返校之權利、</p>
<p>（六）敎育委員會應規定各種關於有系統的敎育上的宣傳辦法、並於最短時間内公布於各種敎育刊物中、</p>
<p>（七）因爲學校作業的效果多半依靠物質上的設備、如實騐室中的儀器、工業室中之工具、和其他敎授上的用具、所以敎育委員會在兩月以内須將中小畢校中應有的設備製造預算、以便進行購署、</p>
<p>四、敎師</p>
<p>（一）在過去幾年之内、自共產黨中央委員會認識敎師的日見增長之活動和責任增加之意義以後、對於敎師之任務方始加以重視、蘇俄敎師的最大任務、應在傳授學生科學上的基本知識、與培養他們尊重紀律的觀念和對於讀書與工作的社會主義的態度、共產黨中央委員會請求各共國的敎育委員會和其他黨政機關、在他們的權　範圍之内、應予敎師一便利、俾他們可履行培養和敎育蘇聯靑年的任務、目前敎師在政治上的地位業已提高、他們的敎授技能亦在在設法改進、並且在購買食料、衣料薪俸的發給、居屋的供給、、以及日常的需要和消遣上、他們都已與工廠中的工人受同等的權利、</p>
<p>（二）當敎育委員會新任命或調換敎師時、應鼓勵有經騐的敎師對於無經騐的敎師予以帮助、在授課進修、或參加校中特别會議的時間内、任何地方機關不得强迫敎師從事其他的社會工作、並且絕對不能用、敎師作任何差遣、</p>
<p>（三）敎師的子女入高等學校時、應得與工人子弟受同等的權利、</p>
<p>（四）自一九三三年一月起、蘇俄國家出版部開始編撲精選的敎育方面之書箱、以低廉的價格、售與各個敎師參考、</p>
<p>（五）敎育类員會丵對於師資訓練的工作、（包含函授科和速成科）應在最短的時間的規劃其進進行步驟、這種訓練工作、特别注重作業的方法、和培養應用地圖儀器圖表、無線電以及其他敎學用具的能力、至於獎勵成績優良的敎師辦法、亦已在積極計劃中、（完）</p>

<h3 id="c141">駡與頌 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>文章是文人批評的武器、用之得當，固是不朽的盛事，用之不當、却也往往召來武器的批評。用法可不是文法，「文章本天成，妙手偶得之」·中國歷來的文人是瞧不起文法的，妙就妙在這「妙手」兩個字。</p>
<p>文有「文心」，「妙手」首先要能「會心」。諷不如頌，貶不如褒，褒死者又不如頌活人，這些就是所謂「文心」。然而頌掦又自有頌揚的一番道理：譬如拍馬屁如果拍在馬脚上，結果便會吃力不討好。韓非著「說難」篇，鬼谷先生也有縱横捭闔之術，可見古人對於頌揚一事的重視與審愼。</p>
<p>古時文人最拿手的是頌，鼎革以還，「文心」大變，於是現代的文人便相率以駡爲能事。復古的駡世道日下、騖新的駡積重難返，穩健的駡過激的，急進的駡保守的，文内有駡，駡外無文。不過頌楊已經難了，駡更何嘗容易？今日國事之所以難談，就是由於大家要駡。</p>
<p>一樣的駡，駡近不如駡遠。一樣的駡，駡中可以反襯出頌。能「會心」了，便是「妙手」了。舉例說罷，譬如鄰近中央的人，可以駡東南，駡西南，駡東北，駡西北；東南，西南，東北，西北的人，也可以把各該所在地除外了，和中央的人一樣的向遠處駡。這樣避實就虚，駡的人快意了，被駡的人也聽不到，聽到了也没有辦法，駡與不駡正相等。否則指着鼻子駡人，保不定要吃一眼前虧」，天下那有如此笨伯？又如某種賦有「駡權」的人，可以時而駡甲，時而駡乙；但是要像紅樓夢書中的焦大一般，寗榮二府的人都給駡遍了，然而却有那門前的一對石獅子是乾凈的。這樣聲東擊西，駡就是頌了。露骨的頌揚人，天下又那裏有如此蠢漢？然則今之「文心」，不尤愈於古之「文心」乎？</p>
<h3 id="c142">通七 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>獨自有房間裏面，内外都已沉寂，只是還不想睡，也不想看書，可是總得做些什麽，否則一步緊一步地逼來的沉寂會把人弄得呼吸也有些不能自如：正在這幾乎無法排解的時候，往往無可奈何地想到通七。</p>
<p>一拿到撲克牌，心就會安靜下來，彷彿被追逐的雉的頭已找得了它的隱藏處似地。在一張一張翻牌的時候，心中希冀着，期待着，關切着，焦急着。看到已翻出了一張黑的七和一張黑的九，怎樣地渴盼着翻出一張紅的八來。眞翻出了，彷彿喝到了一口醇美的酒那麽舒適；翻不出呢，便把希望加速地移到下一張牌上去。希望就這樣延續下去，而且還一些一些地緊張着。而且由此似乎還感到做人終究不是全無意義的。</p>
<p>直到終於淸楚地看到這次通不出了，於是洗牌重來。在洗牌的時候還在懊惱似地想；要是來了一張黑的傑克！要是來了一張鑽石三！</p>
<p>又是一個新的局面的開始。</p>
<p>這次很順利，幾乎心想要什麽就來什麽。於是怡然。於是欣然。</p>
<p>可是，突然想到，反覆地，怎麽這次要通了！這次眞會通了丨於是恐慌隨着佔了喜悅的地位。因爲通了一次以後，不會再有毅力來通第二次的。越看到會通，恐慌的面積便越加擴展着。</p>
<p>眞通了！暫别了的沉寂又不遲疑地從四周大踏步撲了過來。</p>
<p>於是又轉輾地被困在沉寂的中間。</p>

<p>大都市－－</p>
<p>黑烟，勃勃地從烟囱直冒！汽笛，嘟嘟地，歇斯脫里亞的狂嘷！</p>
<p>藍衣的隊伍，迷漫，迷漫，迷漫了滿街：湧汹呵，這努潮，這人之潮丨粗暴，憤怒，死的威脅，光明的引誘！這汽笛，好似一個信號，黑的夜倒了！白的天到了！人們呵！瘋狂地笑！</p>
<p>在都市的那面－－</p>
<p>紅的，綠的Neon熄了！爵士樂，探戈舞，停息，安靜。公子，小姐，醉熏熏地，死沈沈地，屍一樣躺到男的女的懷中，伴着夜神到黑之國！</p>
<p>姨太太，懶洋洋地，拖着被大烟燒焦的大老爺說：天都快明了，還不去睡！</p>
<p>夜明前：</p>
<p>大鄕村－－</p>
<p>慍柔的月光滚走了！美麗的星星也一颗一顆隱掉！光明混在迷霧裏，人都窒息，吐不出氣，天好似昏昏地！但是，夜明前都有一叚迷霧，光明將從霧中擴開，把霧氣逼得連影子都没有！看，那東邊，已泛出紅光一線！呵！眞的！</p>
<p>老頭子，小孫子，大兒子，一大夥子！鋤頭，犂頭，剷，肩在　褸的衣衫上；老的，小的，全一個勁兒快樂的笑，向着日出的方向，勇敢地，沈着地，走！跑！</p>
<p>在鄕村的那面－－</p>
<p>有庭園花木的古舊巨屋，楠木床上，病老頭子，坐着喘氣。旁邊，一個三十來歳的娘兒們，穿着一身黑綢衣掛，憂愁，哀戚！</p>
<p>「伸兒的娘！我！！怕不能久了！但是，我放不了心！天時變了，收成一年不如一年，佃户們一天囂張一天，現在竟連租米都不肯完！唉！這世界，鄕紳怕活不下去了！你們，母子……」老頭子大喘，喘不出下面的話。</p>
<p>夜明前：</p>
<p>在鎭集！！</p>
<p>菜販，黄包車夫，都市的渣涬！每個，每個，在準備，在爬出被窩！</p>
<p>呀！嘈　，繁亂，一列列地黄包車，一担担地菜，一窩窩地人！</p>

<p>（三十九）聯語之起源</p>
<p>自來談楹聯者·皆以爲楹聯始於後蜀孟昶之自題桃符：</p>
<p>新年納餘慶，</p>
<p>嘉節號長春。</p>
<p>予讀李義山集，於其復至裴明府所居一詩前半所云，「伊人卜築自幽深，桂巷杉　不可尋。柱上雕　對書字，槽中　馬仰聽琴。」頗疑柱上句即指楹聯，非蟲蝕蟲迹之謂也。後讀晋書陸雲傳，載雲與荀隠會張華坐。華日，今日相逢，可勿爲常談。雲因抗手日，</p>
<p>雲間陸士龍。</p>
<p>隱曰，</p>

<p>彌天釋道安。</p>
<p>鑿齡曰，</p>
<p>四海習鑿齒。</p>
<p>時人以爲名對。可知晉人淸談，口語亦尙駢麗。不過此可謂之口聯，猶非後人之所謂楹聯也。口聯以逞辯才，楹聯重在裝飾。先有前者，乃有後者，固有遞嬗之迹可尋也。夫我國文字，單音孤立。有平仄可調聲　，有偏旁以見字形。奇偶相生，擅自然之妙；低昻互節，爭天籟之奇。書有「滿招損，謙受益」之文，詩有「觀閔旣多，受侮不少」之句。人文初啓，語亦偶駢。藝事漸情，修辭益麗。此漢魏之間，文章之所以爭趨於整膽之一途也。吾人欲窮聯語之起源，不可不知最先有崇尙駢麗之文章，其次口語亦尙駢麗，然後乃　有駢麗之楹聯，以爲裝飾之具也。</p>

<p>紅羅蔔鬚和他的父親往來書信選（續）</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚給雷辟克的信：</p>
<p>親愛的爸爸，</p>
<p>我已把你的野兔子轉交我們的史地敎員勒格里先生了。我覺得這禮特確乎很使他高興的。他再三要我替他道謝你。我進去的時候撑着一柄濕漉漉的雨傘，他親自從我的手裏接去放在門口。隨後我們便隨便談着。他對我說，如果我用功的話，今年年底歷史和地理兩門功課可以考取第一。可是你可想得到當我們談着話時，我却始終站立着，勒格里先生竟連一個坐位都没有指給我嗎？丨但除此以外，他是非常和靄的。</p>
<p>這是疏忽呢，還是傲慢呢？</p>
<p>我想不出一個結論來，親愛的爸爸，我極希望聽到你的意見。</p>
<p>雷辟克的回信：</p>
<p>親愛的紅蘿蔔鬚，</p>
<p>你竟始終不滿呀。哲克先生呌你坐下，你旣不滿，勒格里先生讓你站着，你也不滿。也許你的年齡還不够要求别人給你敬禮呢。勒格里先生雖没有給你一個坐位，你可原諒他；因爲這一定是因爲你的身子太小了，他誤以爲你在坐着呢。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚給雷辟克的信：</p>
<p>親愛的爸爸，</p>
<p>聽說你要到巴黎去。我願分享着你游歷首都時所有的樂趣。丨這是我很想瞻仰並且最高興和你一路去的地方。我知道學校的功課不許我同去，但我趁這機會請求你一件事情：就是不知道你能不能夠給我買一兩本書。我現在所有的書都已讀得爛熟了。請你隨例選一兩本書都好。實際上，無論什麽書都是相等的。可是我最希望的是福爾特爾（Ｖoltaire）著的「安利阿德」（Henriade）和盧梭著的「新愛洛依茲」（Nouvelle　Helolse）。如果你把這兩本書帶给我的話（巴黎的書是便宜極了的），我可以對你發誓，監學先生决不會把它們没收的。</p>
<p>雷辟克的回信：</p>
<p>親愛的紅蘿蔔鬚，</p>
<p>你對我提起的那些著作家都是同你和我一樣的人。他們所下的東西，你也可以做的。你可以自已寫幾本書，然後再自已去讀罷。</p>
<p>雷辟克給紅蘿蔔鬚的信：</p>
<p>親愛的紅蘿蔔鬚，</p>
<p>我今天早上所收的你那封信使我非常驚異。我看了幾遍，還是不懂。這已不是你平常所有的文筆，並且你在那封信裏說着一些奇奇怪怪的事情，據我看來，旣不是你所能了解的，也不是我所能了解的。</p>
<p>通常，你總是把你那些瑣碎的事情告訴我們，你告訴我們你在學校裏的成績，你在每個敎員身上所發現的優點或壞處，你新認識的同學的姓名，你所有衣裳的狀况，你眠食的好壞等等。</p>
<p>這才是我所關心的事呀。但今天，我却莫明其妙了。請問你，我們現在正在冬天，你爲什麽說上這一番春天出遊的事情呢？這究竟是指的什麽？你是不是需要一條圍頸呢？你的信上旣没有寫上日子，並且也不知道你是寫給我的呢，還是寫給一條狗的。連你的字都像改變了樣子，還有那分行的形式，和大寫字母之多，都使我莫明其妙。總之，你像在嘲弄什麽人似的。我猜你嘲弄的不是别人而是你自已，我現在並不想判给你一個過錯，我不過給你一個警告罷了。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚的回信：</p>
<p>親愛的爸爸，</p>
<p>我現在很忙，衹能給你一句話解釋我上次給你的那封信。你没有看出那封信是用「韻語」寫的嗎？</p>

<p>但我這鄕下土老兒，在上海做了三年三層擱庽公，覺得滿地是黄金，果然不是說夢話。</p>
<p>有些上海鄕下人，從老爸手裏傳下來三十二十畝地皮，雖然史弟打字司折產，姊妹外甥也來啃剝一些，剩下了五畝六畝，租給人家造着十三四層的大厦，遇丁十年八載，上海一天一天地繁榮，地價一天一天地飛漲，每畝由三萬元而五萬元而十萬元而二十萬元、尺土寸金，那不是滿地黄金了麽？</p>
<p>這是說的地皮老闆，就是無產階級，也很可以在地皮上找些黄金層。</p>
<p>在每一個電車站，或是公共塲所　的門口，常可見到一些無產同志，一手提着靑不靑，白不白的布口袋，一手提着大竹筷，隨地檢拾香烟屁股，一樣的可以賣了換取大餅油條，高梁酒，土皮，籠頭水。</p>
<p>每逢大小月底，一陣沉着而凄厲的賣長錠聲之後，亭子樸嫂嫂，三層擱阿姨，都攢聚在後門口，大燒其路頭。這時候，無產階級者，便又掃帚與畚箕齊下，風棬殘雲，美其名日撈錫箔灰。據說，錫箔灰比了香烟屁股還要吃價。</p>
<p>還有一種是專翻垃圾桶的。老於此道的說，拾烟屁，撈錫箔灰，没甚大道理，翻垃圾桶，最有味兒。在垃圾桶裏，鷄毛肉骨頭，家常便飯，銅板銀角，也還不希甚麽罕，弄得巧，金絲圈，金戒子，哈哈，儘憸不用謝，也不用不驚小怪。</p>
<p>上海滿地是黄金，鄕钙人不我欺也。在上海，眞有生路。</p>

<p>戴院長季陶，近在湯山勝地建一别墅，墅中有佛堂，壁刻其太夫人手寫孝經，以埀紀念，戴氏早孤，由太夫人撫育成人，丸熊畫荻，不讓彤史中之柳仲郢歐陽修母也，戴亦能事事循孝，惟太夫人之訓是聽，嘗鐫一章曰：「惡旨酒·」書札上常鈐用之，蓋其太夫人以酒能亂性，諄諄以不親麴孽爲言也，太夫人儉樸作則，戴氏亦能以儉德自守，主政民權報時，常赴滿庭坊小飯店謀果腹，及旣貴顯，猶不忘小飯店之鹹肉豆腐湯風味，時往餔餟以爲樂，偶欵客於寓邸，餚饌輒自備，計四碗一盆，碗則雞爪鴨掌猪脚羊蹄，盆則鹹卵二枚而已，名之爲四脚一蛋席，喜啖花生米，以助文思，撰五中全會宣言，據其左右云丨共啖花生米四百八十文，其平民化有如此。</p>
<p>太夫人書法娟秀，且工吟詠，有哭小軒夫子詩云：嗚呼夫子修文去，我欲從之兒挽住，大兒已成幼未成，母敎雖有豈如父·吁嗟乎！朝復朝兮復夕，生兮死兮兩愁絕，慈親衰老兮腸斷，孤兒啼泣兮環膝，天空濛兮無情，日慘澹兮失色，雲飄渺兮飛天空，月冥濛兮懸白壁，寒霜零零森劍戟，萬木搖落巴山裂，烏鳥依巢魂膽驚，獨我撫棺腸寸折，杜宇啼血烟冥冥，蜀魄悲葉草木腥，遺說耳中聲不滅，心香誓慰君之靈，故戴氏得力於太夫人之敎導，自幼即解韻語·有讀非美戰史題詞云：不聞從軍勞且苦，但願熱血濺黄土，隻手撥開奴隸雲，雙腕擊起革命鼓，其時祇十二三歲耳，戴氏居幼，尚有一兄，喜講理學，當時頗不以乃弟之詩爲然也。</p>

<p>天氣有寒暑之分，人的臉孔，當然也有冷熱之别。奇怪啊！好端端的一張臉孔，眞的有暖有熱，一般在五时霧中過活的朋友，恐怕没有知道它的　　審美會的委員先生們，决計派蜜絲「菲洲」到好菜塢去了。</p>
<p>神秘，凡是在社會上有些閱歷的人，他就很了解人的臉，冷和熱的分别了。</p>
<p>在臥室裏跪在踏脚板上，不得夫人命令不能起立的乂先生，日間在他的遊公室裏，一張臉是如何的冷酷，一絲笑容也找不到，就是見了他的朋友，最多祇能聽他幾聲尖厲的冷笑。</p>
<p>講堂裏，執着敎鞭東提西畫的敎師，在學生面前，是何等地威嚴，平常不容易看見他的笑，也許在校園的角落裏，可以看見他和女生的密語。</p>
<p>郵政局的辦公人員、眞是至尊無上的職位，你看他們坐的位置上，是多麽神氣！尤其是那做匯票的人員，他冷而怪的臉，常常是板的，他雖然雙手不停的工作，但是欄外的匯衆，依然感到他手段遲鈍，等到他將一批匯票做就的時候，一個一個的唱的起名來，我想這正是他得意的時候。</p>
<p>烟兌店裏，他們兌出的銀角子，銅和鉛都不負責任，假如你將原店兌出來的銀角，去兌銅元時，他馬上將銀角在概上亂摜，摜了一陣之後，再仔細地看：他如果不捉弄人，就將銅元兌給你，有些人，會說「這是新版」，或者「私版」，新版私版，都是他們兌出，這且不管，你如其一看他的臉，那就冷得驚人。</p>
<p>你的愛人有所要求，而你却無力應付，不能得到你愛人的親熱；那時候伊的臉，一定是冷的，而且還冷得非常利害，在這個冷的裏面，充滿了金錢的氣分；而愛情的遺蛻，一些也找不到了。</p>
<p>目空一切的庸子，他常常自豪着，所以很看輕一般人，他的臉會生着横肉，初見倒還好，仔細一看，他臉部根根毛孔裏，會蠕動着夜郎的魔影。</p>
<p>冷的臉已寫了幾張，大概已冷了不少，還有妓女鴇母，看伊到了午夜没有客人，那時候的一張臉；和兇惡的主婦，對待婢女的臉；蠻横的司務對待學徒的臉……這些臉，却多在零度以下，大可作諸君的消夏劑呢！</p>

<p>一在街頭碰着朋友們，你看他臉上帶着努容，或走路氣憤憤的時候。切記不要向他打招呼，否則對方必定以惡聲相報。因爲那個時候，他必定是在家裏與家人賭氣出來，或在外面與朋友鬥嘴過後，所以，那時候，正是他怒髮衝冠無處發洩的時候，縱在途間遇着，總以不打招呼爲妙。</p>
<p>二　馬路上的羣衆，平時是很暇裕而悠閒的；如果一經看到人們慌張地逃避，或像怒馬般狂奔，那一定是附近地方起火，或發生亂子了。</p>
<p>三　馬路上有人追逐時，老遠就可以閃躱在一邊；不然的話，謹防有槍彈給你迎面打來。因爲那多半是巡捕在追緝盜匪，或暴徒在剌繫仇家。</p>
<p>四　轉角的地方最容易撞禍，在未走到以前，應應施用你的聽覺，聽一聽各方有没有喇叭聲，呼喝聲，或警笛聲，以免身臨險地而無法躱避。</p>

<p>不遇外面屋子裏二人說話的聲音，已經是越來越細，索興是連一個字都聽不出來。這種態度，很明顯的表示着，這兩個人說的話，是瞞着自已的。自已雖不能干涉人家，但是心裏頭更覺非常難受。關耀武談了許久的話，然後才大聲說了一句再會，就這樣走了。桂枝心裏揣摸許久，覺得這一席話，必定與自已有莫大的關係，這一天是晚了，來不及作什麽主張。。到了次日，却起了一個早，打開大門在街上一站，見甘家雙扉緊閉，還不曾開門，想必積之不曾出門，自已就兩手向胸前一抱，靠了門墻站定，兩隻眼睛，如放出兩道電光一般向甘家的大門注射着。不到半小時之久，那門呀的一聲開了，甘積之滿臉笑容，由裏面走了出來。他一掉頭，已經是看到了桂枝。然而他裝做不知道，將大衣領子，突然向上扶起，遮信了兩邊臉子，打算逕直走去。桂枝立刻跑着跟了上去，抬着手在空中連連招了幾下道：甘二爺，甘二爺，公忙呀，說兩句話，成不成？積之這不便再裝糢糊了，只得停住了脚，回轉身來，向他點着頭道：老姑娘起來得眞早，桂枝道；這一程子，二爺出門去，非常之早，回來又非常之晚，爲着是躱開我嗎？積之笑着連道：不是不是！不過我公事實在忙得很。桂枝道；公事忙也不至於忙得這樣早去晚歸呀。衙門裏辦事，不是有一定的时候嗎？積之笑道：不過近來的確事情忙一點。桂枝也不去追究這個問題，跟着身後，和他一直的向前走着。把海甸的街道都走完了，桂枝突然的站住了脚重聲道；别走了，二爺，我有兩句話說。積之向着他笑道：你没有說付麽，倒先有生氣的樣子。桂枝道：老實說，我心裏早就有氣啦，不過不敢發出來罷了。我聽說二爺怕丢了官，所以不敢和我見面，這話是眞嗎（八七）</p>

<p>淸代旣封孔子之後爲衍聖公；又封張道陵之後爲國師，罻相等也。光緒某年，衍聖公北上，張天師南下，値於運河，爭先行，各不相讓，纜舟而泊。餘船均不得過，線亘數百里。澇運河總督親至排解，亦不聽，乃奏聞。旨交學禮兩部擬議。具復云：「孔家不學張家法，張家必讀孔家書，」遂欽令衍聖公先行。此蓋朝臣以先師之故，作左袒語，實則張家亦示必讀孔家書也。今則衍聖公已自褫封號，而張天師亦早被驅除，孔家之書固無人讀，張家之法更無所施。以視班禪活佛这獨受册封者，其幸與不幸爲何如也！</p>
<p>左宗棠爲淸代中興名臣，以善兵著，然其賞罰，多不循法。方其統師出某地時，有兵入食鋪。啖麵而去，舖主未知也。復有一兵入，據其坐，連聲呼麵。舖主謂其已食，不予，而兵不承。正喧嚷間，適左至，卽命殺此兵，而刳其腹，視其腸胃，無麵。遂顧舖主曰：「汝誣告，常抵。」亦殺之。此眞聞所未聞之軍法也</p>
<p>漢人每謂滿人父子不同姓，其實非也。按滿蒙均無姓，但以所屬部落之名爲其氏，平時亦僅呼名而已。假定其人名成之，字康人，則共呼之爲成康人。如其人爲縣令，則呼之爲成縣令。如其子聲譽或職位過之，則亦以子之名之第一字呼之，與上例同。否則卽呼爲成某，若以成字爲其姓然。此父子不同姓之所由來也。</p>
<p>淸制文武大員，必懸忠孝帶於袍外。其形略如舊式眼鏡套。内貯繩一，刀一，及毒藥一包，蓋爲賜死或盡節時所用也。其後但具形式，乃如飾物矣。</p>
<p>淸德宗處憂患之餘，而抱澄淸之志，高宗後之惟一英主也，惜有如武則天之母，而又有如魏忠賢之奴，遂不能成偉業與高宗嫓美，豈非天哉！聞之先祖云：「進年陛見時私窺之，廣額高觀，實非庸貌，竟賚志以没，可哀也已。」</p>
<p>淸代考試，縣有定額，故大縣常有遺才，小縣每多充數。在小縣者，儘有詞句未通，而獲選者。有某某者亦如此。猶記其主考批語云：「字出格外，文出題外，詩出韻外。如此考童，出入意外。我若不取，又出例外，」可想見共人之文字。所以必取之者，以足額也。</p>
<p>彭玉鏖以耿直聞於朝野。某年，奉使出巡，道經鎭江，泊舟江滸。忽有民婦呼寃，訊之，爲控其奸夫殺共親夫事，先是，婦與捕投某有私，某爲知縣所寵任，虎冠一時，欲殺共本夫，以爲長遠計。婦不許曰：「吾與汝私，中心滋愧，矧更害之，」某不應而去，越數日，復至，語婦曰：「昨遇汝夫，偕遊焦山，乘其不備，推入江中，今可與汝偕老矣。」婦大鶩曰：「若然，必控汝，」某笑曰：「任汝控可也。」婦果控之縣署，不准，控至府，又不准。及聞玉鏖至，乃懷狀而上。玉鏖好私訪，已得其情。往拘某，時知縣已知之，懼禍及已，與某商。某日：「呈犧牲皮肉，堅不吐實，鐵頭又奈我何。知縣以爲是。及往果不承，用刑，亦無一語，但呼寃而已。反覆數四，終不得供。彭怒曰：「本部堂今日寃汝一次，卽殺之。闔邑稱快。凶頑之徒，非此不足以治之。彭返陛見，慈禧溫語之曰：「聞汝有不得口供，卽殺凶犯事，能保其不寃乎！」彭對曰：「卽寃，亦有怨其命耳。」尤爲戇絕一時。</p>
<p>專制時代，大員有過，常遭申斥。奉旨之事，多太監司之。遇申斥事，獲讉者如厚賂之，則奉旨者但宣讀日「奉旨申斥」卽去。不然，則手捧聖旨，肆意謾駡，且辱其父母。雖人所難堪，猶須匍匐恭聽。思之可笑，太監之爲虐，於此可見。</p>

<h3 id="c167">「莫談國事」辯 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>近日來，一般搖筆桿的朋友，忽然都一會兒精靈起來了，大家都衆口一聲的「莫談國事」。似乎從前都以爲國事可談，而現在却大澈大悟的覺得不可談了。其實是天下如此太平，而國家又如此淸明，就使要談，也無事可談，决不是不可以談，而是不必談。老實說，我們原來就自由得很。</p>
<p>而與「莫談國事」相對的，却是「且談風月」，言下大有祢有風月才可以一談之概，其實這又錯了。風月二字，照字面講，似乎有「春花秋月」「名士風流」的優哉游哉的含義。假如打起精神來一彈三嘆，的確的浪漫得很。所以談風月也必須要有「大塊文章」的心境，然後才能做得同「耳得之而爲聲，目遇之而成色」的絕妙文章。而有這等心境的人，又祗有「山人」「居士」「才子」「佳人」之流，我輩豈敢？假如一定要忍受著飢寒戰標也來談，那末即使不至於「一個蚊子哼哼哼，兩個蠅子嗡嗡，」也免不了要唉聲嘆氣的唱着「故國不堪回首月明中」之句，少不了這是亡國之音，又與國事有關，危險得很。</p>
<p>記得遠在我中學時代的古時候，那時也和現在一樣淸明，可是同學們總愛游行演講，於是校長和監學都敎訓我們「莫談國事」。這時候有一個俏皮的同學，在書房裏貼起一張座右銘，是「莫談國事，且讀淫書」八個大字。當然這未免是無理取鬧，有意曲解「莫談國事」的眞理，我們是溫文儒雅之士那难如此？然而「談風月」比「看淫書」總略勝一籌，不過我總也以爲不可不必。</p>
<p>那末我們在這年頭到底應當做些什麽呢？我以爲最好給希特勒做個「正傳」，以「不朽之筆而傳不朽之人」。其次關於莫索里尼的政績，我們大可以爲文宣傳。再如「乂乂主義與戀愛」之類的文章，又何嘗不可以做做呢？這樣才合乎正矩，這樣才合乎君子之道。</p>

<p>— 達人</p>
<p>自殺的流行和監獄的增加，總是表示着社會病態的嚴重，可是在自號爲維持東亞和平的主人，而詆毁中國爲「無組織國家」的日本又是怎樣呢？近來報紙的傳載，不說日本自殺流行，就說監獄客滿。</p>
<p>據五朋九日的申報上載着：三元山之自殺忽大流行，至今日止由山躍下自殺者已達數十名。昨星期日游覧者二千餘名中，竟有自殺者六名，……芝增上寺之道重大僧，正定二十八日赴大島，大施餓鬼，驅除惡魔。</p>
<p>又十二日申報載：據司法省刑局調查上一年間，有犯罪者增加四千餘人，爲近來稀有現象，大勢尙在增加……全國四十五處之監獄及十分所皆告客滿。……都市犯人之增加、其勢更兇，東京四大監獄及福崗監獄，早已不能收容新犯……。</p>
<p>觀此我們就可以知道自殺和犯罪，在日本之激增猛烈了！這樣的情勢繼續下去，也許日本除天然地震之外，又要有人造地震出來了！</p>
<p>日帝國主義年來因經濟加深恐慌，中小資產階級紛紛破產，勞動大衆失業日日增多，無法彌補，於是異想天開，侵略中國，藉以挽救，殊不知興師侵華之費，完全是加重勞苦大衆的擔負，以爲挽救國裏經濟恐慌，反而增重沉疴，自殺和犯罪之激增，是經濟恐慌針銳化之必然結果，</p>

<p>提起接吻兩個字，何等香艶而肉麻啊，歐西人士，在大庭廣衆間，作公開之接吻，似乎没有甚麽希罕，華人的臉兒，大約比西人老嫩得多，對於接吻，尚未達到公開程度，所以對於接吻兩字，還帶着一些神秘的色彩，但吻的方式，却有種種分别，不妨談一下子。</p>
<p>過橋吻</p>
<p>在點心店裏，有蝦仁過橋，豁水過橋等名目，而接吻方面，也有所謂過橋吻之新名詞，什麽呌做過橋呢，就是她們所懷抱的小弟弟或是小妹妹，她和他稍微發生了一些牽絲攀籐的事情時，他將也的小弟弟或是小妹妹，順手牽羊，大吻而特吻之後，她以爲這個接吻，其中很有道裏，於是乎她自他吻過之後，也將這個小孩子大吻一下，這不是過橋吻嗎。</p>
<p>乾吻</p>
<p>乾吻自然不比濕吻的甜蜜，如夫婦或是情人，在勞燕分飛，或是咫尺天涯不能晤面時，就拿所贈的照片手帕情書等恩物，於窗明儿凈，旋邸孤燈，好夢難圓，轉輾反側的當兒，他們情不自禁，將所贈的寳貝，含羞帶恥的乾吻，所謂望梅止渴，畫餅充飶饖，乾吻这意義，竟有不可思義之妙啊。</p>
<p>飛吻</p>
<p>在眉來眼去，兩情相映，大打其無線電報的時候，只能嘴角傳情，將吻飛過去，她方面將飛吻還敬者，則妙不可觀粉音了，白相人所謂「拔靈子」就是這個道理。</p>
<p>偷吻</p>
<p>偷吻，下策也，像貓之竊食，犬之攫物，等斯下矣，不當吻而吻，不願吻而吻，如果冒險而偷吻之，其不有五支頭美女雪茄還敬者幾希矣，或以殺千刀爛浮屍相饗，亦未可知，唉。這種偷吻，可笑亦復可憐，作者並非研究接吻學的忠實份子，實乃在上海社會上，耳所聞目所見，確有事實證明，所以表而出之，說說笑話罷了。</p>

<p>— 勗子</p>
<p>「笆籬破，野狗　」，這是佛先生去年在本刊「談言」欄說的話當時草草　過，尙不覺其言之沉痛，如今看了華府的田地財產，被人明奪暗搶，幾乎要到了家破人亡的絕境，纔深信「家不和外人欺，」確是自取財亡的一個最大原因，下面便是華府一個老家人的傷心語：</p>
<p>「我們」華府本是個服族，人丁蕃盛，田地很多，堪稱富庶之家，只因連年以來、兄弟鬩牆，大家只顧自私自利的爭奪遺產，往往弄得一家人認不得一家人的，自相殘殺，雖日「同胞，」實在是視如「仇敵。」遏着外侮禍患，彼此似乎風馬牛的各不相關。</p>
<p>我們的東隣，那個渾號「倭脚虎」的土豪，平日很埀涎我們華府的許多物產豐富的田地，久欲奪爲已有，可是華府究竟是個大家族，弟兄衆多、他起初還不免有所顧忌，自從前年九月把那分屬老二的那東北角上的大批田地·山塲，公然佔據了，看我們的二少爺只忙着跳舞，賭錢，眼看着先人們艱難締造的產業，被强隣搶奪了去，一些也不抵抗。</p>
<p>大少爺呢，平日正因二少爺席先人的餘蔭，恃財傲物，不所老大哥放在眼裏，如今失去了這許多財產田地，不能再似從前那樣的神氣活現，不能再和老大哥「分庭抗禮，」所以對於「倭脚虎」佔奪老二的田地，樂得袖手旁觀。</p>
<p>至於其餘的弟兄們，因爲各立門户，都抱着「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜」的見解，雖然大家都是同胞，雖然有「唇亡齒寒」的密切關係，却不肯「同心協力」的「抵禦外侮。」</p>
<p>倭脚虎看破了，華府衆弟兄們這種毫無互助團結的弱點，便肆無忌憚，得步進步的侵佔到老三老四的田地上來了。而且殺人放火，姦淫槍刦，華氏的婦女，老幼，都遭受慘無人道的蹂躪。許多好好的房至村莊，都弄成一片焦土，滿目凄凉，妻離子散，鷄犬不安……</p>
<p>老家人惲着婆娑的老淚，歎息道：「唉，如今倭脚虎還在再接再厲，繼續不斷的佔奪我們華府的田地，財產，殺害我們老幼男女，我那主人翁的弟兄們，倘若再不發憤爲雄的急起直追，同心協力的抵禦外侮，那末，「人爲刀爼，」「我爲魚肉，」言念來日，眞使人不寒而傈，而我們先人辛苦經營的祖業，又怎禁得起這樣日蹙地千里的斷送呢？家破人亡的慘禍，怕就逼於眉睫吧……</p>
<p>他說到這裏，竟泣不成聲的暈倒了！</p>

<p>鄙人今年廿五歳，尙未結過婚；前曾在閘北某校做過敎員，因一二八滬戰發生，該校被燬，所以現在某公司任職員。當上海中日戰事發生時，鄙人避難在某旋社，有一素來認識的友人梁女士，她介紹一姓李，年齡較我大的女友給我。當我與她認識時，大家非常知心，竟由友誼而戀愛，由戀愛而願結爲終身伴侶。伴侶。當時她向我談及婚姻問題，我因家產已經完全燬滅於砲火之下，無能力辦理婚事，她又向她的母親商量，得到她母親的同意，然後同居於滬西。後我因職業關係，移居虹口。今年正月，她產了一個女孩。不料上月，她忽然對我說：她是一個朋夫之婦，五年前，在香港已經嫁給一個在外國　生意的丈夫。但她的丈夫，自從離開了她，從未回來過；她的翁姑，又是腦筋腐舊的人，時常因細故吵鬧，備受虐待，因而三年前，她就離開了她不幸的家庭，到廣州市謀生活。後因生活困難，又轉到上海來，因而由我的女友梁女士介紹，興我認識。當我認識她時，並不知道她是一個有夫之婦！</p>
<p>先生，我在這時，有什麽辦法呢？假如我現在離開了她，可憐她是一個孤零的女子，並且那小孩子正在哺乳的時候，不啻置她們於死地；敎我良心上怎能忍心做得到。倘我現在不離開她，將來她的丈夫知道了，呌我怎樣辦法？那時在法律上，我有什麽應得之罪嗎？</p>
<p>先生，我現在應該怎樣做好呢？請先生指導我一個好的辦法吧！</p>
<p>羅　影謹上</p>
<p>編者按：這件事的法律責任，完全在李女士一個人身上。她旣經因爲自已的丈夫，一去不返，違背了「夫婦有同居之義務」的規定，並且觸犯了遺棄罪；加以翁姑虐待，所以離開家庭。那麽當她離開的時候，就應該向當她法院，申請缺度宣告離婚。後來她在認識羅君之後，没有同他發生關係之前，更應當據實相告。所以李女士對於前夫，有背夫潛逃，及重婚的責任；對於羅君，更有欺許的責任。</p>
<p>不過話又要說回來了；中國現在的法院，還不仍是「堂堂衙門朝南開，手裏無錢莫進來」嗎；呌當時的李女士，那裏會有力量去申請呢？至於她到了上海，環境當然非常艱窘，亟亟乎要找一個男子，作爲她生活的泰山；她又那裏可以據實相告，眼看將到手的衣食丈夫，失之交臂呢？所以在法律觀點上，儘管要負絕大責任；我們還是不能不原恕她，憐惜她。</p>
<p>照來信看來，李女士並不是一個忘恩負義之輩，否則她怎肯把實情吐露。所以羅君似平並没有理由，現在就要同她决絕；到得她丈夫發覺，前來理論時，祗須李女士出身一頂，羅君是可以脫然無累的。至於李女士呢，也不必過份擔憂；現在的世界，能活一天，就算兩個半天，到得日後發生問題，比了現在就餓死，總强上幾倍。何况你這種遭遇，任何人聽了，都會同情的，將來弄到法庭相見，也不難邀法官的憐惜，而從輕發落呀！</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>二十一·女人與鴉片</p>
<p>經過一陣恐怖之後，張文彬再也没有睡的意思了。雖然荷香仍然很細膩的服侍他睡下，可是心頭總還是不停的跳躍。他想：假如剛才不幸給蘇部長碰着了呢？那末自已怎樣解說呢？自已偷了他的姨太太還有理由可說嗎？他是五夫人的老爺，柳姑娘是屬於他的；於是不由的氣憤憤的說：</p>
<p>「他媽的！」</p>
<p>可是一想到柳姑娘是熱愛着自已的，事實上他是她的佔有者，馬上又不免驕傲起來，表現出來的是歪着嘴唇的一笑。</p>
<p>忽然有脚步聲響近了他的房門，於是他立刻閉上眼皮，那一定是五夫人來了。他靜靜的聽着；脚步聲在門口停了一會兒，再走近床邊，一股濃厚的粉香夾着肉香。其後有手伸過來給他蓋被了，觸着了他的面頰，於是他再也不能忍耐了，使力的握着她的手，熱情的吻着，仍然閉着眼睛夢藝似的說：</p>
<p>「哦！我的寳貝呀，你到底來了，我正在等着你的嘴唇哩。」</p>
<p>跟着這幾句話後面的是一陣女人的喞喞的笑聲，這笑聲使他驚奇，於是馬上睜開眼睛，不覺使他愕然；啊，原來是荷香在他面前臉紅紅的嬌媚的笑着哩。可是她那嬌媚的眼波使他興奮，她那默默含情使他領受着另一種處女的溫柔，這時候立刻坐將起來，猛烈的將她摟將過來，坐在腿上，趁勢緊緊的吮着她的嘴唇。當然，這時荷香不免要掙扎一下的，到後來還不是順水推舟的任他快樂一番。</p>
<p>忽然武貴在樓梯邊高聲大喊：</p>
<p>「張少爺，張少爺在嗎？」</p>
<p>荷香急忙從他身上爬下床來，整理了一下頭髮迎着武貴走來，輕聲的說：　　「他在睡覺哩。有什麽事嗎？」</p>
<p>「没有醒嗎？老爺請他過去說話哩。」</p>
<p>張少爺在裏面　得十分淸楚，但是他得　做剛剛醒來似的，沙着嗓子應着：</p>
<p>「來啦！」</p>
<p>走到五夫人的房裏，蘇部長正在　在床上抽烟。因爲正是吸得　警的時　不便和他說話，只是斜着眼角招呼了一下，再從　　拔出烟槍慢呑呑的說：</p>
<p>「你在這裏很好，好好的給我照慮照慮，你知道　很信任你的。」</p>

<p>— 以凡</p>
<p>好萊塢受經濟崩潰的影響後</p>
<p>各大明星爲自已的生活打算</p>
<p>「人情冷暖，世態炎凉，」原是古今中外社會上不可避免的現象。卽如美國的好萊塢，自從經濟崩潰的潮流侵入之後，大家都已謠傳著好萊塢已届日落崦嵫的時候了。再加有幾天銀行封閉，弄得明星們走頭無路。穿了名貴裁衣師手製的衣服，而口袋裏空空如也；娘兒們鑲嵌鑽石的錢包裏，除了臙脂和粉撲，其他别無長物。這種日子，呌這班養尊處優的燦爛物如何過法？眞是受盡了人間的閒氣！現在索性好了居然有一位好萊塢赫赫有名的女記者呌NinaWilcox　Putnam的向諸位大明星們出了一個唐突而可怕的問題：「你倘使在好萊塢失業了。怎麽生活呢？」</p>
<p>那天是在一位大導演的家裏有宴會，這位女記者亦在被邀之列。他在席間提出了這個可怕的問題之後，第一個被她攻擊的是里昻巴里穆亞。他毫無準備的，突然受了這個問題的襲擊，他連忙將剛要送到嘴裏」义籌魚子放下，眼瞪瞪地說道：「我可以回到舞台上去的。」「倘使舞台上亦没有機會呢？」女記者繼續進攻着。里昂巴里穆亞道：「那我恐怕要賢畫爲生了。」原來里昂巴里穆亞，是位多能的藝術家，除了影戲與舞台之外，還善長鋼筆畫，很有些小名氣。可是這個問題，眞打動了他的心，他開始深思熟慮起來。過了一回兒他又繼續着說道：「倘使没有人買我的鋼筆畫，我還可以從事於銅版雕刻。政府裏不是總缺少好雕刻家」</p>
<p>嗎？我可以進政府印　局裏去。我雖不能賺錢，我還不能替政府雕刻幾個嗎？」想想了鼎鼎大名的里昂巴里穆亞到了那時，要帶了顯微鏡，一手拿了一塊銅片，一手握着刀，身上穿了工人衣服，滿身銅臭及强水氣味，眞令人不堪回首也。</p>
<p>那位女記者得了解答之後，撥轉砲位，再向着瓊克勞馥進攻。瓊克勞馥進攻。瓊是一位思想質的女子。無論什麽事，什麽話，他總是三思而後行，三思而後言的。他倿受了這個問題，旣不受驚，亦不狂笑。他很安詳地考慮了一回，然後很鄭重地說道：「這個問題，我亦時時想到過。我們不幸生在這種亂世，什麽事情都有遇見的可然。至於我個人，倘使我在電影界失足了，我所能爲的事情，就是敎授跳舞。我淸晨喝了一杯咖啡之後，就出去向各跳舞學校尋覓跳舞敎授的工作。我最喜歡敎小孩子跳舞。無論開跳舞班，在學校裏，在戲院裏，或在私人家中，我都願就，我願使人能領略跳舞跳得好的快樂。倘使時運再不濟些，我可以在馬路上跳舞。那時恐怕世界著名的大提琴家Fritz　Kreisjer亦肯替我拉著梵啞琳。我的愛太亦無妨銜了一隻銅盆向各位站着的人討錢。」那眞不可思議了！　（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c176">評「一片苦心」 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>有聲片一天一天的發達，無聲片销聲慝跡，這樣的一個巨潮，終使約翰吉爾勃John　Gilbert已往的光榮，一落千丈。「活死」固然是最大的失敗了，便是「下層工作」的輿論，也是不十分好。昨天國泰映的「一片苦心」雖然較已往的兩片好些，但是仍舊没有逃出失敗的陷阱</p>
<p>這里他扮一個工人，因爲他的同伴受愚于一個蕩女（？），于是他竭力的去破壞，致使同伴懷恨而去暗傷他。但結果，同伴悔悟而離婚了，他們仍舊是好朋友。</p>
<p>這故事是些什麽？表示友愛應有的精神？諷剌拜金女郎的卑鄙？但是牠毫無中心，一個拜金女郎會去迷戀七十五元薪金的工人？同伴旣恨他已久，受了傷還會肯去看望？很明顯的劇本是有極大的遺憾，何况末尾同伴分明是一個失戀者，女郎仍是一個流浪者，這樣很糢糊的結束，劇本的責任可以算終結了嗎？那同伴前後個性的矛盾，也流露出劇本的不健全。</p>
<p>無聲時代的約翰，誰不知道他是銀幕情人？誰不羨慕他的溫柔秀美？現今他到了中年，没有從前那樣的豐采，不能不改變作風，但是呌他去作下層的工人，眞是不大適宜的。其實他發音很有進步，他三次不能成功，乃完全是劇中人個性不容他發展。這里他表情雖無特殊精彩，但大致是很不錯的，末尾在醫院裏一幕，繼以苦笑，頗有動人之處。飾他同伴的是羅勃亞爾姆斯當Robert　Armstrong太火氣了，例如經過約翰的破壞，他不平之氣，完全暴露，對方是一個多麽精幹的人，他這麽一來，對方不察，反把對方也形容成一個愚魯的蠢人了，這呌作，吃力不討好。」作女郎的是梅克拉爾格Mae　Clarke還好，對於中應有的表情，居然一一做到，活描出一個驕傲而摩登女子的身份。餘下配角雖然成績大致可看，但是每人的單獨工作很，所以不必提及了。</p>
<p>對白太多，也是這片使人疲倦的一個原因。收音攝影，光線，都在水平綫左右，只有高樓下墮，和醫院相聚兩幕，略可看出鏡頭的活潑，和分幕的技巧。外景很偉大，内景有些地方脫離了現實，不似劇中人身份所應有的陳設。</p>
<p>導演對於有趣的穿插太少，他又不會用影片應有的波折，以吸動觀衆的注意，所以除幾幕特别精彩（指表演和劇情轉變的地方）以外，全片顯着單調乏味。</p>
<p>爲了約翰個人，比較優美的技藝，和配角技巧的整齊，這片子也許還値得一看吧？</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c177">談春水情波 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 雨明</p>
<p>近來中國影片動輒以「改變作風」四字相號召，但是看了之後，仍不免使人失望。</p>
<p>「春水情波」是明星公司最近的進步作，這裏面描寫封建制度下一切的活動，官塲的醜跡，盲目的戀愛，升官發財的思想，宗法社會裏的黒暗，這一切都在這影片裏暴露了出來，但是靠着西北墾殖團微弱的團結奮鬭，决不會打出窮人們的生活，何况要談到打倒帝國主義和封建勢力呢，這是意識的弱點，而使人們得到一個錯誤的觀念。</p>
<p>導演的技巧：我覺得還欠嚴密，在唐樹生戀愛阿毛的時候之前，應該加上一段初變發動的穿插。游湖的一段，佈景幽美，從樹枝望到隱隱約約的動作，是很動人的。</p>
<p>個人的表演方面：胡蝶的表露喜悲的情感是非常體貼，可惜在「生產」時的前後的表情太形疏忽。而從大體看來，她確是很適合來表演這個性的。孫敏在這裏表演非常不得力，嚴月嫺胡萍王獻齋等都得稱職。</p>
<p>此外字幕比前簡約，可是總脫不了禮拜六派的文辭。末了，我敢介紹這影片比以前的自由花等高明得多。在中國影片裏能有這樣成績，可以說是不壞。</p>
<h3 id="c178">看「春水情波」後感 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 馮瑛</p>
<p>時代的巨輪，進輾到二十世紀的現今，戀愛的聲浪－實體並一般靑年男女們的中間，確是一天一天地澎湃起來，同時報紙上又反應着載出遺棄的新聞，假使吾們用研究社會學者的眼光去探討，一定能夠分析出慘酷的成分在裏面哩。</p>
<p>春水情波一片，它整個前劇情很明顯地暴露出始亂終棄的慘酷，和鍍金式戀愛的罪惡，官塲的黑暗，戀愛的無謂，在此亦作有力的描寫，同時爲受封建惡勢力壓迫下的女子，作有力的呐喊，尤其是對於濫用愛情，玩弄女性的男子·給也一個當頭棒唱。</p>
<p>導演的手段平庸，致使前後的劇情，太不緊凑，可是在遊湖的兩幕，和幾幕甜，苦不同境遇的對照，吾們不應抺殺的。</p>
<p>演員方面，最成功的是胡蝶，她的表演，處處能使觀衆生深刻的同情，嚴月閒亦不差，可是孫敏比較在前程中，覺得是退步了。胡萍亦有相當的成功。</p>
<h3 id="c179">觀「春水情波」後的感想 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 徐梅蘭</p>
<p>春水情波，多麽含有詩意的一個題名。星期日校中没有什麽事，我就同了幾個同學到新光去賞鑒。</p>
<p>明星公司現在很注意到女性方面的事情，所以牠有好幾張片子都是討論我們女子的問題。牠很明瞭我們女子現在所處的環境，牠處處揭示出我們女子在現社會中是怎樣的被人玩弄，是怎樣的感受悲哀。牠一面戳穿資產階級的兇惡，一面暴露我們女性的弱點。當然，拿這些來做電影的題材，以促進女性本身的覺悟，意義是很好的。</p>
<p>愛一個，棄一個，這是資產階級者的家常便飯。自然他們是不會顧到被遺棄者的悲哀和痛苦的。我以爲在這個社會裏，女性在自已不能自立，什麽都要倚賴男子的關係之下，其被玩弄被蹂躪，是必然應有的現象。男女平等這句話，根本就是騙人的。我覺得我們女性，在這樣惡劣的環境之下，除了奮鬥之外，再没有别條我們可以走的途徑，我們如果不甘心在資產者壓迫下過慘苦可憐的生活的話，我們就得拿出我們的毅力來與惡環境惡社會奮鬥，我相信我們若能夠不氣餒不屈服，勝利一定是屬於我們的，女同胞們，一致起來罷丨（缺章却酬）</p>

<p>— 孟宜</p>
<p>「前程」裏所描寫的，係現代社會的一種普遍現象，反過來說：也是靑年男子在新舊交替的社會中易犯的錯誤。在熱戀中，往往理智不能統治情感，於是行不由已的做出種種自欺欺人的事來，這些道理，原很淺顯而易　的：可是靑年男女，在狂戀期中的行爲是紛亂的，所犯的過失，往往是明知故犯的。在「前程」裏，雖然我不到一點因果報應，但是它却爲一般，時代女子長留下一個指路牌－－就是說：女子嫁了丈夫以後，不能完全沈醉在愛河之上而依靠丈夫：要自已繼續不斷地爲自已「前程」努力</p>
<p>一天到晚，忙着修飾，吃大菜，看影戲，跳舞的所謂「時代女子」，觀此「前程」，也當醒悟了吧！</p>

<p>— 魯道夫梅蘇氏著抱寒譯</p>
<p>於靜待後命空間時間之中，尚可略事休息，或一二日，或至一星期，或一片攝完之後，即連續攝製他片，俱屬無足輕重之問題，蓋彼自八影業之日始，已得一終身之從業，但求從事者自身不至見異思遷，半途中輟耳。此等僱用之條件，蘇俄全國俱已普遍施行，具亦不僅限演員一種人，其他如木匠，技術有員，燈光師，以及攝影塲中工作人等之全體，均得享受同等待遇也。</p>
<p>至如所謂電影明星者，蘇俄亦有之，其所得之俸給，亦略與他國電影明星所得者相捋。至於此等明星之特殊待遇，是否與共產哲學相合，讀者可自决之，惟此處所應加以說明者，即俄國之電影明星，大抵均係舞臺上之名角。彼等日中拍攝影戲，别給優美之薪資，而在夜中則仍返各戲院從事於舞臺之生活。至欲以電影主角之資格而升爲明星，則在蘇俄境内，實屬絕無僅有之事。蓋蘇俄影片之本質特殊，係爲思想之運用而創設，非爲個人之地位而設想者也。　　此外復有一事足述者，蘇俄失業問題，旣已消滅，故無臨時僱用多數羣衆短時間表演之可能，而影片中亦遂缺少羣衆表演之幕序。近代蘇俄影片之編製，亦以僱用最少數之臨時演員爲主要考慮。但至按照劇情羣衆表演不可缺少之時，導演惟一可爲之事，即爲等待隣近工廠工人休息之日，招致多人，每人給以二十五慮布，爲七小時工作之代價。此種方法，大致雖屬便利可行，但亦不能謂如此即可任意攝製羣衆幕序也。再則工人方面，雖有爲二十五慮布所引誘而甘放棄一日之休息時間者，但據作者所知，多數工人則俱願留一日爲游息之用而不願多得二十五慮布之閒散錢也。</p>
<p>再則以上所言之羣衆，係指二百人以上之臨時演員而言。至如每幕所需人數在二百以下者，儘可由本攝影塲一切工作人員臨時補充之，如打字生，土木工作人等，俱可權充銀幕上人物。惟所需臨時演員超過二百之數，則攝影當局遂不得不另籌徵求之法矣。（未完）</p>

<p>Japanese Troops in Tongxian Remain on Original Defensive Line</p>
<p>Fake Troops Stationed in Ninghe City</p>
<p>(Beiping) Starting today, the main force of the Japanese army has been gradually withdrawing eastward. However, their advance units are still holding their original defensive positions. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gaoliying, Shunyi, and Lutai are peaceful and uneventful. The Japanese troops in Tongxian remain on their defensive line, unchanged. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tanggu reports that a Japanese warship is anchored near the Japanese barracks. The area is generally peaceful. Japanese troops along the Beining Railway line remain in Xugezhuang. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lutai reports that Zhao Dian's puppet troops in Ninghe City are prohibiting pedestrians from passing. This afternoon at 3:00 PM, over thirty puppet cavalrymen attacked our defensive line with machine guns. Our troops returned fire. The puppet troops were unsuccessful and retreated. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tongzhou reports that this morning around 9:00 AM, a Japanese aircraft flew from east to west. The Japanese troops east of the city remain on their original defensive line, unchanged. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tanggu reports that the area is currently peaceful. One Japanese warship has already withdrawn. It is said that the remaining warship will also leave soon. Plainclothes units have been cleared out, and our police and military are operating as usual. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lutai reports that the city is peaceful. Zhao Lei's puppet troops in the Ninghe area are still in the city. Their infantry and cavalry are stationed around Xiguan, confronting our troops. However, they occasionally fire machine guns at us. We are responding calmly and have not returned fire. Gaoliyingzi and Shunyi are both peaceful and uneventful. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Measures Regarding the Disposition of Puppet Troops <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the disposition of the puppet troops, the Japanese side states that these troops are mostly reorganized from volunteer armies or gathered from bandits. The Japanese side is unwilling to accept them. Our side believes that the puppet troops are a special detachment directed by the Japanese side to disrupt our side. They must be withdrawn by the Japanese side. Otherwise, the presence of Li and others in the demilitarized zone is an obstacle to peace, as we cannot send troops to suppress them. Moreover, Shi Yousan is even recruiting soldiers under some kind of protection in Thailand, which further draws our side's attention to the issue of puppet troops. After discussions with the Japanese representative, the Japanese side has agreed to no longer provide assistance to Li Jichun, allowing our side to handle him freely. Action against Shi will also be brought up for discussion with the Japanese side. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Aircraft Flying Over Ping City <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning around 10:00 AM, a Japanese aircraft flew over Ping City, conducting reconnaissance for a long time before flying northeast. The Japanese aircraft that have been flying in from the northeast for the past two days are all reconnaissance planes, specifically for transmitting military intelligence and reconnaissance, to determine whether our troops have withdrawn after the signing of the armistice agreement. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>Receiving Committee to be Formed by Political Reorganization Committee</p>
<p>(Beiping) Our side is discussing methods to maintain order in the demilitarized zone after the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The Political Reorganization Committee will form a receiving committee to take over the administrative organs in the area east and north of the front line. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The takeover of counties east and west of the Lu River will have to wait until the withdrawal of Japanese and puppet troops. Police to maintain order have not yet been organized.

<p>(Tianjin) The Sino-Japanese armistice agreement does not contain political conditions, nor does it mention the establishment of a buffer state between mainland China and "Manchukuo." The Chinese here are both relieved and bewildered. However, it is expected that purely political matters will be discussed by Huang Fu with Arite, the Japanese ambassador, when he comes north. The signing of the armistice agreement may allow the Japanese army to free up a large portion of its forces to suppress bandits in Manchuria and for the purpose of capturing the Zhangjiakou area. Foreign critics now believe that Japan deliberately made the terms of this preliminary peace agreement lenient so that China could sign it without losing face or self-respect. It is also believed that many important matters not mentioned in the agreement are covered by verbal understandings made between Tokyo and Nanjing. In the eyes of Chinese and foreigners, this armistice is no less significant than the armistice of the World War in 1918, as residents feared daily that the Japanese army would invade Pingjin and perhaps even spread to the Yellow River and the entire China. The speed with which the armistice agreement was signed is considered strange by both Chinese and foreigners, as the armistice negotiations only began on Thursday or Friday.

<p>(Nanjing) The North China Armistice Agreement was signed yesterday in Tanggu by representatives of China and Japan. It is said that the National Government will issue a declaration on the 2nd, stating the government's hardships in resisting Japan since the September 18th Incident, the fatigue of our troops in fighting the recent war in North China, the poverty suffered by the people due to the disasters of war, and the difficulties of having to sign an armistice agreement that only covers military matters and does not involve politics.

<p>(Beiping) Xiong Bin made a statement at midnight on the 31st regarding the signing of the armistice agreement, saying, "I and others were ordered during a difficult and dangerous time, and are filled with trepidation. We could only follow the central government's instructions and Chairman He's directives, and do our best to negotiate. Fortunately, after arriving in Tanggu, Japanese representative Major General Okamura and others negotiated with an extremely sincere and friendly attitude, allowing the agreement to be established quickly. Although it is difficult to expect understanding from the entire nation, I can answer to my conscience. I only hope that both sides will maintain this sincerity. I am truly pleased." (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After returning to Ping last night, Xiong Bin immediately went to Juren Hall to meet with He. He only left Juren Hall at 3:00 AM this morning. According to reports, the signing of this armistice agreement secures the safety of Pingjin and stabilizes the people's hearts. He said that he is clear in his conscience. He dares to assure the people of the country that there are absolutely no other attachments or verbal agreements outside the five clauses signed by the Chinese and Japanese sides. The entire scope is military and does not involve politics in the slightest. This time, he acted according to what he believed to be right, disregarding temporary praise or criticism. The area between Yanqing and Lutai, east and north to the Great Wall line, does not yet have a defined name. Maintaining order in the area will be the responsibility of specially trained police with armaments, whose training and numbers will be determined by our side according to actual needs, without Japanese interference. The Japanese army will withdraw within days, and the majority of our troops have already withdrawn. The Beining Railway will be directly open to Yuguan once the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>No Political Conditions to be Signed</p>
<p>Peaceful Methods to be Adopted Internally</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei spoke about the Sino-Japanese issue, stating that the policy indicated by the central government is that negotiations and resistance are permissible under the principle of not ceding sovereignty or humiliating the nation. This position has been consistent and has not changed in the slightest. This time, in the North China armistice, our side is determined to discuss only military matters and not sign any political conditions. The disputes between the two countries are clearly unresolved, and we cannot immediately equate the armistice with a compromise or surrender to Japan. Comrades from all sides, on the one hand, are driven by patriotic fervor, and on the other hand, do not understand the central government's attitude, thus creating misunderstandings. The central government will naturally forgive them. However, since the Southwest Central Committee members have repeatedly issued circular telegrams, there is inevitably talk of exaggerated fears, which has a significant impact on the future of the situation. At a time when the national crisis is deepening, it is still worrying that we may not be able to save the situation even if we gather the strength of the entire country. If any aspect or any part of the country deviates from the right path, the danger will be unimaginable. Therefore, I dare to assert that in the current environment, no one would have the heart to start a war and place the country in a state of irrecoverable ruin. In order to make the Southwest aware of the recent realities of the Sino-Japanese issue, the central government initially planned to send Mr. Ju Juesheng and Mr. Li Xiehe to Guangdong to explain and invite comrades in Guangdong to come to Beijing to work together on the grand plan. However, Ju and Li themselves have not yet agreed. Whether to send others instead will be decided by the central government. As for a thorough negotiation of the Sino-Japanese issue, judging from the situation, it must wait until after the London Economic Conference before it can begin. This is because the nature and scope of the Sino-Japanese issue can no longer be resolved by the two parties involved. Therefore, the League of Nations has already accepted it, and if the League of Nations itself exists, it should follow through to the end and be responsible for resolving it. However, if we harbor a mentality of reliance, it will not help to improve the situation. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When asked by reporters today about Feng Yuxiang's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the National Anti-Japanese Allied Army and the appointment of the Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, President Wang replied, "Although our side has signed an armistice agreement with the Respect Military Representative, it is limited to military affairs and does not involve politics. However, it is difficult to determine whether the Japanese army will not invade Chahar and Sui again in the future. When Feng assumed the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Army, he sent a telegram to Huang Yingbai, saying that the purpose was solely to resist Japan and protect the safety of Chahar Province. If Feng can lead the troops in Chahar to stop the advance of the Japanese army, it is also the duty of a soldier. As for the appointment of the Chairman of Chahar Province, the government does not want to express anything at the moment. In short, the government will resolutely use peaceful methods to resolve all internal disputes. In terms of external affairs, it will always uphold the principle of resisting on one hand and negotiating on the other, and will not yield to force. Regarding the telegrams from the Southwest and from Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, the central government has already sent telegrams to explain the misunderstandings."

<h3 id="e22">The Signing of the North China Armistice Agreement <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the crisis in North China, the military's peaceful understanding has been widely spread for some time. Due to the circumstances, the newspapers have no freedom to disclose it, failing to provide readers with a fully satisfying record. We sincerely apologize for this. Now that the signing of the armistice agreement has been announced in the newspapers, in this time of panic and turmoil, to have the opportunity for peaceful respite and to fulfill the people's hope for recovery, although we deeply feel that the road ahead is long and there are many difficulties, we should also deeply understand the authorities' efforts to seek compromise and preserve the whole. However, this military agreement, its peace is limited only to a military truce. How long this kind of peace can be maintained, not only do we not dare to predict, but even our country's authorities are probably uneasy and dare not be too optimistic.</p>
<p>First, since the September 18th Incident, the world knows that Japan is the direct instigator. Our country, with its peaceful initial intention, repeatedly appealed to the League of Nations to seek the upholding of public reason and justice. Although the result was two moral victories of thirteen to one and forty-two to one, in reality, Jinzhou and Rehe followed the three northeastern provinces and were lost. The counterpart in this military agreement, while outwardly it is Major General Okamura Neiji, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army directly commanded by the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, the name he represents is the Kwantung Commander. The secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China only occupies a position as an advisor. Compared with the Sino-Japanese military agreement in Shanghai, the difference is that the North China military authorities are opposed to the Kwantung Army, and China is opposed to Japan. The importance is certainly not the same, but this time the North China relationship is even more important than Shanghai. The material losses and the trampling of territory and people cannot be mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<p>Second, our country's troops "must withdraw to the area west and south of the line connecting Yanqing, Changping, Gaoliying, Shunyi, Tongxian, Xianghe, Baodi, Lintingkou, Ninghe, and Lutai." "The Japanese army may inspect by military aircraft or other methods." Our military's retreat is subject to this restriction, and must be monitored by enemy aircraft. Only when the Japanese army confirms that it has withdrawn to the above-mentioned area and that China does not "continue to pursue" will it "automatically return to the line of the Great Wall." What we deeply regret is that our country's military actions within its own territory are subject to these restrictions and must be monitored by enemy aircraft. The Japanese army then says, "automatically return to the line of the Great Wall." Whose territory is this, ultimately? If we are to talk about the Japanese army returning, the boundaries of its territory cannot be so vague and unclear. Because doing so may leave behind disputes later on.</p>
<p>Third, after the North China armistice agreement was signed at the Dagu Shipping Company in Tanggu, both sides raised champagne to celebrate the success of the agreement, celebrating the hope of peace. On the Japanese Kwantung Army side, they should have raised their glasses and smiled, thinking of their unparalleled achievements, and the speed of their success. But for our country's representatives, drinking this glass, thinking of the suffering and displacement of the people of North China, one hardly knows whether it is tears or blood. Furthermore, according to Japanese Kwantung Army representative Okamura's reflections after signing, he said, "...This time, the direct and quick resolution was really exhilarating. Needless to say, the Kwantung Army will temporarily have to monitor whether the Chinese side complies with this agreement..." Our country's representatives, reading this, one wonders what their feelings are. What we fear is not the temporary peace at present, but the hidden dangers in the future.</p>
<p>Fourth, within our country, "resist Japan and suppress the Communists" and "sincere unity" have become consistent and commonly used slogans. But upon careful examination of the reality, there is also some doubt and fear. The arguments issued by the Southwest Central Committee members and Mr. Feng Yuxiang's claims, although we have not been able to elaborate on their content, based on the telegram of advice from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee, it appears that the Southwest Committee members are "resisting Japan with empty words from distant Guangdong, ... spreading rumors by means of provocation, discouraging soldiers from suppressing the Communists, alienating the feelings of anti-Japanese generals, and taking pleasure in others' misfortunes with the intention of watching from the sidelines... destroying the national position... affecting diplomacy..." At the same time, the words of advice to Mr. Hu Zhantang of Hong Kong are as follows: "-Sir, your attitude is ambiguous and your actions are passive. Those who do not know will surely think that it comes from your instructions. ... "National hatred may still be resolved, but private hatred is most difficult to eliminate." The house of Ming Society really arises from this. One can be convinced that national affairs are impossible to do. ..." It is known that at this time, when foreign troubles are urgent and internal worries are not yet resolved, party and national leaders, who usually claim to be experienced in governing the country and call on the world for "sincere unity," are unable to "unite" to resist aggression to the point of not hesitating to "destroy the national position." How can they not be "pleasing to the enemy?"</p>
<p>Although military action in North China has temporarily come to an end with the establishment of an armistice agreement, the Japanese side is still strongly advocating "monitoring" actions. Therefore, the realization of an optimistic future is still far away. Moreover, the four northeastern provinces, with an area of 4.35 million square kilometers, are still under foreign coercion. Even if North China is temporarily stable, can our people ultimately remain silent? Do the leaders not consider this? This is why we are worried, fearful, and cannot help but speak out.</p>

<p>(Harbin) The dispute between Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo" over the Northeast Road is escalating again. The "Manchu" authorities today blockaded the Suifenhe Railway, which is located at the border between Manchuria and Russia. Crossing it reaches Russian territory and Vladivostok. After Vladivostok is closed, passengers traveling from Western Russia to Vladivostok will have to travel around Outer Baikal and the Amur River, which is a longer route. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Russian Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, visited Vice Minister Shigemitsu of the Foreign Ministry at 10:00 AM on the 1st upon the order of his government. He protested the blockade of the Suifenhe junction of the Northeast Road and requested the Japanese government to mediate the issue. Shigemitsu replied that the issue was between Russia and "Manchu" and that the Japanese government could not interfere with the actions of the "Manchukuo" government. However, the relationship between Russia, Japan, and "Manchu" is currently very delicate. The Japanese government will investigate the truth before responding. (Rengo dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Sokolnikov today asked Japan to stop the Manchu puppet organization and local Japanese officials from interfering with the Northeast Road and other Soviet interests. The note was addressed to the Japanese Ambassador Ota, stating that the Soviet government is very willing to negotiate the sale of the Northeast Road to "Manchukuo," but such negotiations should be conducted in a spirit of friendship and should not be obstructed by interference with road affairs. It also mentioned the puppet organization's blocking of traffic between the Northeast Road and the Ussuri Road. The Japanese government's reply regarding the Soviet vehicles detained on the Northeast Road was also published today. The Japanese government stated that the matter should be resolved by the Russian director of the Northeast Road and the "Manchukuo" railway officials. (Kokumin dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Russian and Japanese governments recently exchanged diplomatic notes regarding the Northeast Railway dispute. Japan denied any involvement in the "Manchukuo" government's actions on the road, while the Soviet Union strongly argued that this was merely a formal excuse. Japan replied to the Soviet Union's note of May 16, which requested that the Japanese government immediately implement effective plans to protect Soviet interests on the road, stating that most of the infringements on such interests cited by the Soviet Union were entirely within the scope of the "Manchukuo" government, and the Japanese government could not be held responsible for the actions of Japanese officials and Japanese advisors acting on the orders of that government. It also stated that the Japanese army had always been careful not to harm the interests of the road, and that Japan now guarantees its willingness to resolve the dispute quickly and fairly. It concluded that the maintenance of good relations between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" is the most important foundation for peace in the Far East. The Soviet reply stated that the guarantees given in the Japanese note had been received. The Soviet Union claimed the Japanese government's intention to make a formal excuse for the Manchu authorities' infringement on Soviet rights, referring to this as being entirely within the scope of the "Manchukuo" government, and evading its responsibility had been dispelled by the guarantees in the note. The Soviet Union hoped to obtain a practical solution from this guarantee, and also stated that "Manchukuo," with the assistance of Japanese officials, was using the railway dispute as an excuse to carry out drastic and illegal actions that harmed Soviet interests. The Japanese government could not provide any justification for "Manchukuo's" demand for the return of the detained trains. The Soviet government's willingness to begin negotiations on the sale of the road clearly demonstrated its desire to eliminate the source of all disputes hindering Russian-Japanese friendship. Striving to consolidate this friendship is an element of the Soviet Union's peace policy. The Soviet government has the right to hope that the Japanese government will also use this same will as a compass. The reply concluded by expressing the hope that all controversial issues would be resolved in a friendly spirit, in accordance with the guarantees in the Japanese note. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Disarmament Convention Begins Organization <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Drafting Committee Uses British and American Plans to Draft Convention Text</p>
<p>Ignores Japan's Proposal to Negotiate New Naval Agreement</p>
<p>Adjourns for Four Weeks After First Reading</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Main Committee today decided to ask the Drafting Committee to begin drafting a new draft of the disarmament convention based on the proposals made by the British representative, hoping that the General Committee can approve its method of proceeding. The current plan is for the Drafting Committee to draft the convention text based on the British and American proposals, completely ignoring Japan's proposal to allow the negotiation of a new naval agreement. Judging from the resolution of the Main Committee, it is evident that Britain, the United States, France, and Italy have no intention of reintroducing the naval issue at this time. The new draft convention is expected to be drafted within a few days and will be submitted to the General Committee for a first reading. The amendments agreed upon during the first reading will then be submitted to the Drafting Committee for revision, and the General Committee will adjourn until June 27, so that the initial efforts of the World Economic Conference can be entirely limited to economic matters and not be distracted by other affairs. Some disarmament representatives may also attend the London Conference. At that time, the Drafting Committee will remain in Geneva to continue drafting. The General Committee has already voted on the adjournment and authorized Chairman Henderson to adjourn for three weeks or more if he deems it necessary. However, the General Committee has not yet made a decision on the request of the Main Committee to provide concrete instructions on the adoption of the British plan. Although the United States has fully endorsed the British plan, except for a few points, and France has also accepted the British plan as a basis for discussion, it is anticipated that the General Committee will approve the request of the Main Committee. Some drafting committee members are quite concerned that the new draft convention may not be completed until June 9, but the members will work hard to expedite its completion. The key points of the British plan are threefold: to stipulate the agreed-upon actual number of European land forces, to conclude a consultation convention, and to reaffirm the provisions of the Washington and London naval treaties. Although Japan generally agrees, it wants to avoid mentioning the existing naval treaties altogether.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Disarmament Conference Decides to Adjourn Until July 3 <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference decided this afternoon to adjourn immediately after the first reading of the draft convention submitted by Britain. The resumption of the meeting is scheduled to be no later than July 3. The first reading of the British draft is expected to be completed on Saturday. As for the decision of the Main Committee yesterday to draft a new draft convention based on the British plan, due to the opposition of the representatives of France, Norway, and Switzerland, it was decided that the General Committee would not make this proposal until the first reading of the British draft was completed. However, the Disarmament Conference will not completely waste time during the adjournment period, as the General Committee has adopted the compromise proposal of the American representative, Hugh Wilson. Therefore, the Main Committee will continue to meet from time to time, and Chairman Henderson will conduct separate consultations in order to draft a new draft convention. The General Committee met at 11:00 this morning, but immediately after the meeting began, someone opposed the decision of the Main Committee yesterday. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour and Norwegian representative Lange both opposed adopting the British draft as the basis for a future international convention before the first reading of the British draft was completed. The representatives of Yugoslavia, Turkey, the Netherlands, and Persia opposed the Main Committee's proposal to engage in consultations and draft a new convention during the adjournment period, arguing that limiting the number of committee members to a few major powers was unfair. Then, the French representative attacked the Main Committee's proposal from another angle, insisting that the chapters on prohibiting private manufacturing of munitions and limiting military budgets should also be included in the new convention. Thereupon, Chairman Henderson attempted to quell the opposition of the small countries and proposed that he be authorized to consult on the new convention during the adjournment period, and proposed extending the adjournment period, moving its termination date from June 27 to July 2. The representatives of Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, and Turkey all agreed. The General Committee made the aforementioned decision at 2:00 PM, then took a short break and scheduled to reconvene at 3:00 PM to continue the first reading of the chapter on supervision of disarmament in the British draft. It is expected that the French representative will submit many amendments to strengthen the power of the provisions at that time. (Kokumin dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(New York) The Japanese Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for Representative Ishii this afternoon. Ishii gave a speech during the banquet, discussing his conversation with President Roosevelt. He claimed that he and President Roosevelt agreed on many points, and that Japan and the United States are in the same position. We believe that the friendship between Japan and the United States, although somewhat discordant in the past 20 months, has not changed. The United States is sympathetic to Japan's struggle against communist propaganda in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(New York) Japanese Representative Viscount Ishii attended a welcome reception hosted by Consul-General Horiuchi at noon, giving a speech outlining Japan's policies toward China, stating that the Kellogg-Briand Pact should recognize the destruction of treaties and economic boycotts as illegal, so that countries do not use such methods as tools of national policy. Ishii said that if this is not done, the League of Nations will be difficult to operate. The recent developments in China can attest to this. For the past 20 years, China has relentlessly launched economic attacks on Japan, and Japan has suffered as a result. The League of Nations Covenant provides no remedy for this situation.

<p>(Washington) The American delegation to the Economic Conference, Secretary of State Hull, economic elder statesman Cox, Senator Pittman, Representative McReynolds, accompanied by 15 aides, set sail for London today. Senator Costigan and other representatives will depart within the next week. The US government finally added Morrison, a retired banker from San Antonio, as a representative, who also traveled today. Before his departure, Hull claimed that the American delegation would first focus on reducing tariffs, stabilizing exchange rates, and raising prices, but he declined to disclose the details of his plan, saying only that he believed that after talks between the president and politicians from various countries, the major issues at the conference could be agreed upon within three weeks. (Kokumin dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House announced today that the US President has completely changed the procedure for resolving war debts, no longer entrusting it to Secretary of State Hull or other representatives to negotiate outside the London Conference, but instead being personally presided over by the President and continuing negotiations through normal diplomatic channels. This is because the President feels that if war debt negotiations are conducted concurrently with the Economic Conference, it will distract the representatives and prevent them from concentrating their attention. He also feels that after talks with politicians from various countries in Washington, all parties have a clear understanding of the issues and believes that the war debt issue can now be addressed on the basis of this understanding.

However, what guarantees do the conditions demanded by Japan ultimately provide for the future, to ensure that peace can be sustained? This is something we cannot say for sure. The newspaper concluded that Japan can still use China's failure to fulfill the terms of the truce as an excuse to refuse to withdraw its troops from the neutral zone as required by the agreement.

At the same time, the Minister of the Interior of Selenkia prohibited the National People's Party students from gathering. Today, the National People's Party leader of the Mecklenburg state appealed to President Hindenburg, Chancellor Hitler, and National People's Party leader Hugenberg against the rejection of the National People's Party's participation by the Mecklenburg state government. Today, four leaders of the Stahlhelm League of the National People's Party in the Hüningen region were detained for recruiting new members in violation of the agreement recently established between the Stahlhelm League and the Brownshirts.</p>

<p>To Issue Bonds Worth 1 Billion Marks</p>
<p>To Promote Industry and Initiate Projects</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 31st – A proposal to authorize the Ministry of Finance to issue bonds worth one billion marks, enabling the government to implement its unemployment relief plan, was passed by the Cabinet today. This plan was initiated by the President of the German National Bank, Schacht, who will oversee its financial aspects. The plan includes projects such as repairing public and private buildings, developing suburban garden cities and rural areas, and constructing new national roads. The plan also has other distinctive features: (1) a provision for women to leave employment and return to household duties; (2) encouraging marriage, with financial assistance for families; and (3) promoting industry and increasing production to counter dumping by countries with devalued currencies.</p>
<h3 id="e61">International Chamber of Commerce Congress <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 31st – The International Chamber of Commerce Congress convened here today, passing two resolutions. One advocated continued international negotiations to abolish double taxation. The second called for the abolition of currency controls in the short term. At the third session, the issue of currency stabilization was discussed. The French representative, Song Li, strongly criticized the harm caused by currency fluctuations, stating that silver could not serve as a standard for trade between nations and that the gold standard should be restored. The Italian representative, Bian Zhini, said that he had previously advocated organizing a public fund to achieve currency stabilization. Another Italian representative, Pi Lai Li, said that the universal support of the congress delegates for removing currency barriers was very gratifying. The American representative, Wadsworth, believed that the main cause of the global economic crisis was the excessive increase in the budgets of most countries.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Nazi Party Headquarters Raided <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Restrictions on German Goods Imports</p>
<p>Reuter, Vienna, 31st – Police today raided the headquarters of the National Socialist Party here, as well as the residences of Nazi leaders in Vienna and other locations, including the residence of Habicht, Hitler's commissioner in Austria. Habicht is currently negotiating with Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dollfuss on the merger of the Nazi Party and the Christian Social Party (the ruling party). Today, Habicht declared that negotiations had failed because the Austrian government was unwilling to allow the Nazi Party to participate in the cabinet according to its strength.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 31st – The Austrian government has now ordered Austrians wishing to go to Germany to obtain passports. The German government stipulates that Germans going to Austria must pay 1,000 marks for a passport fee, while the Austrian government only charges a fee for issuing passports, thereby monitoring the movement of people between the two countries. The Austrian government has also decided to compensate hotels for financial losses incurred due to the new German regulations, amounting to approximately 10 million Austrian schillings. The Austrian government has also restricted the import of German goods, ensuring that their total value does not exceed Austrian exports to Germany. This measure will harm Germany, as Germany has traditionally had a trade surplus with Austria. In the past five years, Germany's sales to Austria have exceeded Austria's sales to Germany by more than 1,200,000,000 Austrian schillings.</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 31st – The Locarno Accords of 1925 include an arbitration treaty between France and Germany. This treaty stipulates the establishment of a permanent conciliation committee.

<h3 id="e64">Anhui's New Chairman, Liu Zhenhua, Takes Office <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Announces Governance Policies for Anhui Upon Taking Office</p>
<p>Overview of Financial Management Over the Past Year</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence – The newly appointed Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, Liu Zhenhua, along with the Director of Civil Affairs, Ma Lingfu, the Director of Finance, Mao Longzhang, and the Director of Education, Yang Lian, arrived in Anhui on the Changxing vessel of the Sanbei Company at 6:00 AM on the 29th. In anticipation, officials and members of the political circles, as well as the provincial government military band and police personnel, all gathered at the Sanbei Wharf to await their arrival. The Highway Bureau also dispatched several vehicles to welcome them. (The road from the provincial government to the Sanbei Wharf had recently been completed overnight and a completion ceremony was held in front of the provincial government at 4:30 PM on the 28th, followed by a test drive.) After disembarking, Liu shook hands with the welcoming party and entered the city by car, heading directly to the provincial government to rest. Li Yingsheng, a member of the Provincial Committee, and Liu Yiyan, a member of the Provincial Committee and Director of Construction, had already arrived in the province beforehand. The remaining member of the Provincial Committee, Ye Yuanlong, who also serves as Secretary-General, Hu Rulin, still needs to arrive. Liu was originally scheduled to take office on June 1st, but because he also serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Area Bandit Suppression, he urgently needed to take office. Therefore, the ceremony was rescheduled for 10:00 AM on the 30th in the auditorium of the provincial government. Over a thousand representatives from various circles and officials from various institutions attended. The ceremony was conducted according to protocol. First, Liu delivered a report and announced his governance policies for Anhui, including (1) purifying officialdom, (2) rectifying education, (3) making finances transparent, and (4) providing relief to rural areas. Then, Wu Rencang, a member of the Anhui Provincial Party Rectification Committee, delivered a speech. After the speeches, a group photo was taken and the ceremony concluded. Subsequently, Liu and the directors of the various departments began their duties.</p>
<p>Another report states that Anhui Province's tax revenue, before the abolition of the Likin tax, was over 11 million yuan per year for both national and local taxes. After the abolition of the Likin tax, it was only over 9 million yuan. In 1919, expenditures increased sharply, and revenue and expenditure could not be balanced. The budget for the 21st year was reduced from over 13 million yuan to over 11 million yuan, which could still balance revenue and expenditure. Before April 20th of last year, various institutions were in arrears of funds, with some owing up to five months. The accumulated arrears of regular expenses totaled over 797,000 yuan, and the accumulated arrears of temporary expenses totaled over 4.267 million yuan, for a total of over 3.94 million yuan. This did not include the 500,000 yuan of treasury bills issued. After Wu Zhongxin took charge of Anhui, through more than a year of patching up, the current arrears of regular expenses are only over 370,000 yuan, and the arrears of temporary expenses are only over 410,000 yuan. The unappropriated funds are also only 1.44 million yuan, for a total of over 1.7 million yuan that has been paid back. 250,000 yuan of treasury bills have also been cashed. The field tax for the 21st year was pre-allocated by Chen Tiaoyuan during his tenure, amounting to around one million yuan. The field tax for the 22nd year has not yet been used. Now that Liu Zhenhua has succeeded as the head of Anhui's administration and has expressed that finances will be transparent, if he continues to rectify the situation, it may not be difficult to balance revenue and expenditure in a year's time.

<h3 id="e65">Sino-Japanese Armistice Negotiations Begin <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Representatives Gather in Tanggu</p>
<p>Three Japanese Warships Anchor Offshore</p>
<p>Situation of Japanese Troops in the Withdrawal Zone</p>
<p>No Complications Expected in the Future</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping – Since the practical methods for a cease-fire were agreed upon, Sino-Japanese peace negotiations have been actively underway. After several days of consultation between the two sides, the negotiation location and the number of representatives have been completely determined. Each side has sent six representatives to Tanggu, a more suitable location, to hold negotiations. After careful selection for several days, our side has decided on Xiong Bin, Zhang Qun, He Zhuguo, Yin Rugeng, Liu Ximing, and Zhang Shouguang as the six representatives, representing various relevant parties and responsible for coordination. Xiong Bin will serve as the chief representative. In addition to the representatives, Qian Zongze, Xu Zuyi, and several others have been hired as specialized committee members for the purpose of gathering ideas from various sources. The Japanese representatives are the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Koiso, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Okamura, the Commander of the Tianjin Garrison Army, Nakamura, the military representative, Major General Tani, the military attache, Colonel Nagasawa, and the secretary of the Japanese Embassy, Tanaka. Koiso and Okamura, along with their entourage, arrived in Tanggu yesterday (29th) afternoon at 5:00 PM aboard the Japanese warship and entered the Japanese barracks after landing. Nagasawa has been in Beiping for a long time, and Tani also arrived in Beiping yesterday morning to make contact. This morning, Tani, Nagasawa, and Tanaka, the three representatives, went to Tanggu on a special train with our representatives. Nakamura also went from Tianjin. After our representatives were determined, the Railway Bureau prepared a special train yesterday afternoon and parked it at Yongdingmen. This morning (30th) at around 7:00 AM, Xiong Bin, Zhang Qun, Qian Zongze, Xu Zuyi, and the Japanese representatives Tani, Nagasawa, and Tanaka successively arrived at the Yongdingmen station to board the train. Security was extremely tight at the platform. The train departed at 7:55 AM, with two rows of military police on board to provide protection. Before the train departed, an armored train left from the East Station to clear the tracks. At 10:40 AM, the special train arrived in Tianjin. He Zhuguo, Liu Ximing, Yin Rugeng, and Zhang Daoguang boarded the train to travel together. At around 12:00 PM, they left Tianjin heading east and arrived in Tanggu at 2:00 PM. Representatives' residences and conference venue in Tanggu had been prepared in advance. The conference venue was decided to be in the China Merchants Bureau conference hall. After the representatives from both sides gathered in Tanggu, they will first engage in informal socializing, meeting each other. Formal negotiations are scheduled to begin tomorrow (31st). Due to the Boxer Protocol, a small team of Japanese soldiers was originally stationed in Tanggu. With the arrival of the Japanese representatives for the conference, the number of soldiers has been slightly increased. Yesterday, two Japanese warships arrived in Tanggu, and this morning (30th) at 6:30 AM, another warship arrived, carrying three 5-inch guns. There are now three Japanese warships anchored in the waters off Tanggu, seemingly displaying military force at sea to protect their peace representatives. Although there have been informal contacts regarding various issues beforehand, there are still various difficult problems obstructing progress. Whether or not things will proceed smoothly in the future will depend on the sincerity of the Japanese side. However, in general, there is optimism regarding the future of the negotiations, and it is believed that no complications will arise midway.</p>
<p>The front lines have been generally quiet in recent days, but the puppet troops are still very active, with minor disputes occurring. The Japanese troops claim to be unaware, which is likely deliberate. Since yesterday, Tongzhou, Shunyi, and other places have been extremely peaceful. Near Lutai, in the Tianzhuangtai area, the puppet troops and the volunteer army of Zheng Guilin's unit had a small conflict. Tianzhuangtai was occupied by the puppet troops yesterday morning. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Zheng Guilin led his guards in a counterattack, crossing the north bank from Erdaoqiao and occupying Peijiazhuang. They are currently confronting the enemy at Liu Da Gongzhuang. The wounded soldiers of Zheng's unit were transported to Beiping for treatment this morning. In the Ninghe area, the puppet troops of Zhao Lei's unit are still occupying the city. Japanese troops in Hedong are at Yangzhuangzi, occasionally firing at our Mengzhuang position. Our troops are maintaining calm. North of Luofa on the Pingjin Line, Japanese scouting soldiers were previously discovered but have now retreated, and the area is peaceful. This morning, a Japanese plane flew to Tongzhou for reconnaissance, and two planes also flew to the Gaoliying area of Changping, purely to scout our movements. As for the skies over Beiping, no Japanese planes have been seen for several days.</p>
<p>Another special report states that the Chinese and Japanese armies have entered a state of ceasefire since the two sides began armistice negotiations. In the Ninghe area, the Mori Regiment of Japanese cavalry had retreated to the area of Lihuamaozhuang, Dayuzhuang, and Yangbozhuang by 1:00 AM last night (29th). Most of the Japanese troops are still confronting our troops on the line from the west gate of Ninghe to Renhanzhuang. In Xianghe, most of the Japanese troops are gathered in the city, and all city gates are tightly closed and not opened, prohibiting people from entering and exiting. Japanese infantry and cavalry, numbering about 500, are also stationed in Ma, Fang, Xiejialou, Dadong and other villages. The Japanese troops in Wuqing previously sent puppet troops to organize plainclothes teams, hoping to cross the river from Luofa and disturb our rear, but they did not succeed due to strict precautions. In other areas, such as the Lutai area on the Beining Line, although there are occasional disturbances by puppet troops, no fierce battles have occurred in recent days. The Japanese troops on the Pinggu Avenue have withdrawn towards Miyun, but their artillery is still at Shilipu and has not moved. At around 10:00 AM today (30th) in Tongzhou, a Japanese plane flew over for reconnaissance, circling for a long time before flying northeast. At 10:10 AM in Gaoliying, two Japanese planes flew from Changping, circled several times, and flew south. At around 3:00 PM on the 29th, four or five Japanese scouts were discovered in the Beiwulibanqiao area and quickly left. Japanese cavalry occasionally go to the vicinity of our defense zone to patrol and scout. The Japanese scouting soldiers in the Luofa area have already left. The situation in Shunyi has not changed. The situation on all lines is generally very calm. At present, all parties are focusing their attention on the issue of peace and are paying close attention to the progress of the armistice negotiations. The scope of these armistice negotiations is limited to military affairs. The party in charge of everything on the Japanese side is the Kwantung Army Headquarters. Previously, Nakayama, the acting representative of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, and Nakamura, the commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin, telegraphed Araki, requesting instructions on the armistice issue. After Araki replied to the Kwantung Army Commander Kobuto, seeking his consent, preliminary verbal consultations began. Therefore, Koiso is also traveling with them this time. It is expected that the issue of the demilitarized zone and the disposition of the Northeast volunteer army will be discussed during the meeting. The Japanese army has proposed that neither side station troops within 24 miles inside the Great Wall. This may be raised again after the meeting is held, but because it is purely a local problem and does not include political or diplomatic issues, it is expected that opinions will be easier to reconcile before the meeting.

<p>The Meeting Has Concluded, and Major Plans Have Been Determined</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Will Return to the Province to Command Military Affairs</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence – Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke and other members of the Central Committee gathered in Lushan to discuss national plans, and the situation has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Those who arrived in Lushan included Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Chiang Kai-shek, Luo Wengan, Huang Shaoxiong, Zeng Zhongming, Liang Hancao, Chen Shaokuan, Ma Chaojun, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, and Yang Yongtai. Wang resided at No. 94 Guling, and Chiang resided at No. 13. All the important figures on the mountain, except for Huang Shaoxiong, met at Wang's residence on the evening of the 28th. First, the two presidents, Wang and Sun, reported on the recent central political, military, and anti-Japanese situation. Then, Luo Wengan reported on the details of diplomacy and the progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations after the ceasefire. At the meeting, fundamental methods were discussed to deal with the current urgent situation. Continued meetings were held on the 29th, and Chiang Kai-shek gave a detailed report on the anti-communist campaign in Southeast China. The National Congress and other important issues were also discussed. On the evening of the 29th, Huang Shaoxiong arrived and gave a detailed report on the recent situation in North China, the anti-Japanese military situation, and the situation after the ceasefire, analyzing the situation in detail. All the important figures expressed their opinions and made a final decision on the military and diplomatic situation in North China after the ceasefire. The meeting lasted until 2:00 AM that night before dispersing. At the moment, Wang, Sun, Chiang Kai-shek and others believe that all major central plans have been discussed in concrete terms, and they went down the mountain on the morning of the 30th. Wang and his party arrived in Xun and then took the Chu You warship back to Nanjing. Chiang Kai-shek and others personally escorted them to the warship. Considering the importance of the anti-communist campaign in the five provinces, they will also return to the province to command the anti-communist military affairs in Southeast China.

<h3 id="e67">A Visit to the Guangxi Reclamation and Water Conservancy Experimental Area (Continued) <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>(IV) Work Achievements Over the Past Year</p>
<p>The area has been in operation for exactly one year now. Looking back on this year, we want to know if there have been any significant achievements, and what those achievements are. Now I will briefly describe the achievements of the area in the past year. (1) The Lending Office When the Lending Office was first established, farmers were generally in a state of fear due to long-term oppression and exploitation by landlords. When the area sent people to the countryside to promote lending in mid-March, farmers thought it was just another trick by the government or a vicious harmful policy, and they all dared not try it. The propagandists wanted them to sign a letter of intent, but they absolutely refused. Later, unintentionally, several workers who were working in the area short-term needed money and borrowed from the Lending Office. The Lending Office lent them money according to the procedures, at an interest rate of 1%, and this incident opened the door. Farmers began to believe in the Lending Office. Within ten days, hundreds of farmers came to request loans, some borrowing 100 yuan, some borrowing 50 yuan, and some borrowing 30 yuan. Within just ten days, 30,000 yuan had already been lent out. From this, we can see how deeply farmers are oppressed by usury and local forces, and how urgent the need for low-interest loans is in rural areas. When farmers borrow money from the Lending Office, they must first undergo an investigation to determine their degree of need and whether the purpose is legitimate, and then determine the amount of the loan. The repayment period is after the autumn harvest. Farmers have excellent credit, and 95% of them repay the full amount before the deadline, and 5% repay on time. When the reporter went to visit, the third phase of loans was being issued. The lending office was filled with farmers, all looking happy and joyful. The staff at the office are very serious about their work. Farmers borrowing money must first be interviewed in person by the director of the Economic Improvement Organization, who determines the amount and other factors face to face. Usually, the director carries a small bag on his back and goes to the countryside to investigate, sleeping in farmhouses at night, never complaining. The director studied in Japan and is a passionate practitioner. In addition, the Lending Office's warehouse is under construction and will be completed soon. Farmers will be able to use the warehouse to store grain during this fall harvest.</p>
<p>(2) Reclamation A central farm and a horticulture farm have been established in Shatang, with an area of only 1,000 mu. 3,000 mu have been reclaimed in the Shibeiping area. Recently, eight gasoline plowing machines are being used to reclaim land, and it will soon reach over 10,000 mu. In the Wuyou area, about 1,000 mu of paddy fields have been reclaimed. In total, about 5,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed in the area in the past year, excluding afforestation, which is less than one-twentieth of the planned reclamation area. In the future, reclamation and planting will be intensified.</p>
<p>(3) Water Conservancy The area has a very large plan for water conservancy. The rivers in Guangxi mostly have rocky beds and very turbulent water flows. If a little artificial work is added, they can be utilized. Most people are not easy to convince, so the area is currently starting to utilize hydropower facilities. The plan is to build dams on the rivers to raise the water level, and then use the water force to install motors. The area is paying attention to the preliminary scale of this matter, and there are already some clues. If the plan is realized, it will not only drastically develop rural production, but also open a new era for the industrialization of agriculture in Guangxi. Its future is truly unlimited.</p>
<p>(4) Transportation Developed rural production requires convenient transportation. The area has paid attention to this point early on. About 70 li of automobile roads and 50 li of field roads have already been built, greatly increasing transportation convenience. In addition, the Liucheng waterway is also sufficient to aid transportation.</p>
<p>(5) Surveying The area has a surveying training class, which is used for its own purposes and is often hired by other counties.</p>
<p>(6) Investigation Rural investigation is extremely important in rural construction, because all facilities must be based on precise investigation, otherwise they will be empty and unsupported. However, at the same time, rural investigation is also one of the most difficult tasks. Investigators often do not fulfill their duties and arbitrarily fabricate reports, often causing the entire investigation to be useless. I remember a certain province's Department of Agriculture and Mines conducting a rural investigation. After the investigators arrived in various counties, they only sat in the county seat, and sent official letters in the form of detention orders to summon the village chiefs of various villages, briefly asked them questions according to the form, and then considered it done. Although our country has recently gradually realized the importance of statistics, major domestic agencies have mostly set up statistics departments to specialize in this matter, but in practice, they are nothing more than the situations described above, or they pass through official documents, from the National Government to the Provincial Government to the County Government, and the county then passes it down to the district office, and the district then passes it down to the township head. If the township head has nowhere to transfer it, they then rely on what their minds can imagine, filling it in arbitrarily. Some even do it because the deadline is approaching, and the county does not pass it down to the district, but a few clerks who only know "due to the reasons mentioned above, I am writing this" vaguely fill it in, and then consider it done. These statistics are naturally completely unreliable. The area's investigations are not perfect because it lacks investigators who are fully trained to specialize in this matter, but because of its frequent contact with farmers through loans, it is relatively reliable. Half of it is also due to the seriousness of the area's staff in their work, so it has achieved relatively significant results.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is still too early to say whether the area's business operations will be realized as expected in the future, and even if they are realized, whether they can solve the entire rural problem of China. However, speaking only of the pilot area itself, with its perfect plan, noble purpose, and the efforts of its staff, it is certain that it will have a considerable development in the future. This is something that we can predict.</p>
<h3 id="e68">He Chengjun Convenes Military Conference in Shashi <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Decides on Bandit Suppression Plan, Allocates Military Defense Zones</p>
<p>Deputed to Hunan to Attend He Jian's Inauguration Ceremony</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, Pacification Commissioner of Hubei Province, believes that the bandit He is entrenched in western Hubei and urgently needs to be suppressed. He took a plane to Shashi from Hankou on May 28th to inspect and instruct various generals on military matters. At 9:00 a.m. on the 29th, He attended an enlarged memorial week at the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in western Hubei and gave a speech to officers and soldiers of the 10th Army. At 1:00 p.m., he convened a military conference with the generals stationed in western Hubei. Xu Yuanquan, Pan Shanzhai, Yang Shaodong, Jiang Zuojun, Zhang Gang, and others attended. The meeting lasted about two hours. Plans to suppress the remaining bandits in the border area of ​​Hubei and Henan, and the defense zones of the various armies were completely decided. Xu Yuanquan was given the highest command responsibility, leading the above troops to take the front, directly attacking the bandit lair. The Sichuan and Hunan armies were to take the flanks to prevent their escape. He's banditry ravages western Hubei, and the people gnash their teeth. He's trip is enough to show the government's determination to suppress bandits and give the people great comfort. Therefore, He received a warm welcome from all walks of life in Shashi. At the end of the meeting on that day, He attended the welcome meeting and gave a report. He was scheduled to return to Hankou by plane on the 31st. Xu will wait for the concentration of the various armies to be completed, and then begin to suppress according to the decisions of the conference. It is heard that He's internal affairs have indeed disintegrated. Once large troops are deployed to cut off their supplies, internal strife will surely occur within a few days. Taking advantage of the opportunity to attack, it can be settled in one battle. The bandit Kuang's group is still moving and fleeing between eastern Hubei and southern Henan. Initially, there were only 3,000 people, but now it has increased tenfold. The Kuang bandit was originally in northern Sichuan. Seeing that no one was in charge in that area, and fearing that he would be wiped out by the national army, he secretly came to Hubei and took on the role of commander. He is highly respected among the bandits and is also known for his fighting skills. After arriving, the bandits regarded him as their leader and listened to his orders. The Kuang bandit grasped great power and then tried to restore the original bandit area, integrating the remnants of various bandits. He used all his strength to attack one place, especially Lihuang as his destination. Lihuang is located between Qiliping and Bopi River. It was originally called Xinji. Before the national army recovered and established the county, it was an important bandit lair. Since the bandits' sights were on this place, they took advantage of the fact that the national army had not yet fully concentrated and attacked Lihuang a few days ago. The 75th Division of Song Tiancai, stationed in Shangcheng, and the 45th Division of Dai Minquan, stationed in Gushi, were unable to provide assistance in time, and the place was rumored to have been captured by the Red bandits. The situation on the border between Henan and Hubei suddenly became serious. Liu Zhenhua, the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the border area of ​​the three provinces, originally planned to go to Anhui to take office as the chairman of the province, and then go to Huangchuan to supervise the suppression. Now, due to the urgency of the military situation, he plans to return to Hankou from Nanjing within a few days to go to Huang to preside over the suppression. Chen Jicheng, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in southern Henan, and Wei Lihuang, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in eastern Hubei, are currently deployed in Huangchuan and Hekou. After Liu's arrival in Huang, he will order a general suppression. (May 29)</p>
<p>Another News: He Chengjun, Pacification Commissioner of Hubei Province, set off for Shashi a few days ago to inspect and convene generals for a military conference, and to inspect the garrison. On the 30th, He received a telegram from the Central Committee, saying that He Jian was scheduled to take office on June 1st as the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route of the Bandit Suppression Army of the five provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei, and was sent to represent the oath-taking supervisor. Therefore, at 9:30 a.m. on the 31st, he took the No. 406 plane of the 4th Aviation Team to return to Hankou. The No. 404 plane escorted him. At 12:30 p.m., he arrived safely in Hankou. He went to the Pacification Commissioner's Office to consult with Chief of Staff Yang Kuiyi, Chief of General Staff Zhu Chuanjing, and Director of the Office Chen Guangzu on everything, and met with generals such as Shangguan Yunxiang, Dai Minquan, Guo Rudong, and Song Tiancai to give instructions. At 4:00 p.m., he took the ferry across the river to Xujiapeng Station, and at 5:20, he took a special express train on the Hunan-Hubei Railway to Hunan. Hu Xiehuai, the representative of the 4th Route Army stationed in Hankou, accompanied him to take care of him. Before leaving, He told reporters that this inspection tour to Shashi was to inspect the military discipline and the spirit of the soldiers. The purpose was to rectify discipline. After inspecting the 48th Division of Xu Jiwu's Brigade stationed in Shashi and other remaining troops, they were all in extremely good condition. He's bandits are still entrenched in Shihe. Regarding the suppression plan, he has discussed and decided with Commander-in-Chief Xu Yuanquan and the generals. The deployment is extremely strict. Director Fan Zhaoxu, who also arrived in Shashi, has also met. He was ordered by the Central Committee to go to Hunan to participate in the inauguration ceremony of Commander-in-Chief He and represent the oath-taking supervisor. He will not delay much in Hunan and will return to Hankou that night. The remaining bandits in eastern Hubei urgently need to be suppressed on a large scale. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the border area of ​​the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui will start working one day. Commander-in-Chief Liu Xueya (Zhenhua) is scheduled to come to Hankou from Anqing by plane on the 2nd and then go to Huangchuan to take office.

<h3 id="e69">General Headquarters Orders Hubei Provincial Government to Cooperate with Military in Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Orders Counties with Dikes to Strictly Prevent Floods in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>Chief of Staff of 51st Division Ding Teng Accused of Profiteering and Dies Under Prosecution</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The General Headquarters of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, believing that the remaining bandits in Hubei have not yet been eliminated, and that the county magistrates of various counties have failed to cooperate with the military, and that the members of the local defense forces are complex and poorly trained, is an important reason. On the 30th, it strictly ordered the Hubei Provincial Government, as well as the Department of Civil Affairs, the Security Office, the Administrative Commissioners, and the county magistrates of various counties that if they procrastinate again, they will be removed and punished. The order said: "The suppression of the remaining bandits requires the cooperation of the local administrative officials and the suppression forces. It also relies on the organization of local security teams to be properly organized and to strengthen the self-defense capabilities of the people in order to be effective. Recently, reports have stated that bandits lurking in central and western Hubei have not been eliminated, all because the county magistrates of various counties have failed to do their best to cooperate as the main reason. Especially, the security teams are not well organized, the members are complex, the system is unclear, and they have failed to take consistent actions with the military, which often leads to missed opportunities, which has allowed the bandit forces to spread, which cannot be denied. The county magistrates of various counties have the responsibility of the local area and should deeply understand their duties and eliminate evil without reservation, in order to achieve a permanent solution. If the remaining bandits are not eliminated for one day, the duties are not fulfilled for one day. After this order is issued, if they still procrastinate, neglect their duties, fail to assist with efforts, or fail to effectively organize security teams, the provincial government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Security Office shall investigate and remove and punish them. During the period of suppression, the security teams of various counties shall also follow the organizational regulations of the Administrative Commissioners' Offices and be subject to the command of the senior generals of the bandit suppression in order to achieve unified effectiveness."</p>
<p>(Flood Prevention of the Jianghan Main Dike)</p>
<p>On the 30th, the General Headquarters issued an order to the counties along the Jianghan Dike to strictly prevent floods in accordance with the regulations. The order said: "The Secretariat of this Headquarters presented a case and approved a letter from the National Economic Council, stating that the Jianghan industry in Hubei Province flows through dozens of counties, and building dikes to control water is extremely important. Between summer and autumn, floods rise, and the long dikes of thousands of miles are in danger inch by inch. Defense and rescue are especially urgent. The key to safety lies in whether laborers and materials can be rushed to work in a hurry. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect dangerous areas in advance and prepare materials. It is especially necessary to summon laborers and supervise them to work in order to avoid delaying the opportunity. Therefore, the local government must be responsible for handling flood prevention matters in the past, so that the collection of materials and laborers can be done locally. The major annual maintenance projects of the Jianghan Main Dike in Hubei Province have been strictly ordered by this council to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to speed up the work and will be gradually completed. Now that the flood season is approaching, the flood prevention matters of the Jianghan Main Dike should be decided as soon as possible, and the local government should still be responsible for the preparations in order to avoid negligence. Now, according to the situation of the Jianghan Main Dike and referring to the annual maintenance regulations, thirteen articles of the flood prevention measures for the Jianghan Main Dike this year have been drafted. A letter is sent accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and forward it to the approval, and instruct the relevant local governments of the Jianghan Main Dike to comply with the regulations. The matter concerns the dike, so be careful not to delay and neglect. You should also report the compliance to this Headquarters for verification."</p>

In addition to binding the convict official Ding Teng to the execution ground for execution by firing squad, an announcement is hereby made to inform everyone of this announcement.

<p>The silkworm flood this year is early and late. Those who raise cocoons early are eager to sell them. The silk cocoon merchants who have a good appetite also hang up scales to collect cocoons early, and the offer price is as high as 50 yuan per load. The Cocoon Industry Association presented a request to the county government to strictly prohibit silk cocoon merchants from destroying the association's resolution, and the Construction Department ordered the current director of the First Public Security Bureau, Gao Chongshan, to be the commissioner for maintaining the cocoon price, and to take the police on a gasoline boat to patrol the rural areas to maintain the cocoon price and not to allow the offer price to be raised. A total of more than 170 cocoon shops in the four townships reported to be opening. Yesterday (1st) was the first day of the cocoon shops opening. In Dongxiang, in the shops such as Ruping Yu창and others in Dongting Town, the price of improved fresh cocoons was 535 yuan per load, and the local variety was 30 to 40 yuan per load.

The goods were not涌急, and the same was true in the southwest townships. It is heard that the reason why the shops are raising the offer price is that the cocoon farmers are asking for 50 yuan per market price for selling cocoons. If they do not raise the offer price to collect goods, the door will be deserted. Therefore, they have to temporarily raise the offer price in order to attract customers.</p>

The China Star Film Company and the American Fox Film Company also arrived to film a sound movie to commemorate the event.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Yesterday, starting at 1:00 PM, dignitaries and famous people from the city arrived one after another. Those present included Central Representative and Central Bank President Kong Xiangxi and his wife, Minister of the Military Affairs Department Ge Jing'en, Mayor Wu Tiecheng and his wife, Security Director Yang Hu and his wife, Wang Zhengting and his wife, Dai Ji's representative and Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command Zhang Xiang, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Haian, Finance Ministry Secretary Guo Dehua, Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, Public Works Bureau Chief Xu Peihuang, Health Bureau Chief Li Tingan, Shen Dexie, leaders from all walks of life such as Yu Qiaqing, Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Xu Shiying, and others, as well as people from all walks of life and students from various schools, totaling over fifty thousand people.</p>
<p>Order of the Assembly</p>
<p>(1) Music, (2) Singing of the Party Anthem, (3) Paying the Highest Respects to the Party and National Flags and the Portrait of the Premier, (4) Chairman Reverently Reads the Premier's Will, (5) Report, (6) Speech, (7) Naming Ceremony, (8) Aircraft Handover Ceremony, (9) Sky Ascension Ceremony, (10) Performance, (11) Music, (12) Ceremony Concluded. The presidium of the assembly was composed of Wu Tiecheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, and Lin Kanghou.

Mayor Wu performed the naming ceremony, presidium member Yu Qiaqing and Aviation Director Ge Jing'en performed the aircraft handover ceremony, and Mayor Wu's wife performed the sky ascension ceremony.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The naming ceremony began at 2:30 PM in the afternoon. After the ceremony was performed in accordance with the rituals, Wang Xiaolai of the presidium gave a report, stating briefly that the Chinese Aviation Association's solicitation team had ordered eighteen fighter planes in the first batch. Today was the day to hold the naming ceremony for the first Shanghai City aircraft. This aircraft can be said to be an aircraft of patriotism and resistance against Japan through the united cooperation of the people and the government. Today we arrived at Jiangwan, and along the way we witnessed the tragic situation. In addition, we don't know what the situation in North China and the current state of Tianjin and Beijing are. We can only endure hardship and strive to strengthen ourselves through aviation to save the nation, completely to consolidate national defense and strengthen our strength. We must also pay attention to three points simultaneously: (1) Aviation to save the nation, (2) Abolish civil war, (3) Promote domestic goods. These three points cannot be achieved solely by relying on the government; the people must work together, and so on.</p>
<p>Kong's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Kong Xiangxi, the special representative of the central government, gave a speech, stating briefly that today is the day for all compatriots to donate the first aircraft to the national government for naming. He was deeply impressed and admired. The Premier advocated saving the nation through aviation, and we should strive to follow his lead in developing the country. In recent centuries, military warfare has evolved from planar to three-dimensional, relying entirely on the strength of the air force. As Marshal Foch said, "An air force</p>
<h3 id="e80">Center: Director Ge Jing'en (Photo by Li Zunyong) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>is the main force for victory or defeat in war." The January 28th Incident and the anti-Japanese military affairs in North China both failed due to the lack of an air force. Therefore, to consolidate national defense, we must develop aviation. Especially, the government and the people must cooperate fully. The Shanghai citizens, under the leadership of Mayor Wu, have shown the initial expression of cooperation with the Shanghai aircraft. He hoped that the public would enthusiastically donate so that the fleet could be expanded from the first team to ten teams and dozens of teams to contribute to the national aviation construction and achieve it as soon as possible. With these eighteen aircraft, the government can form a squadron. He hopes that the citizens of all provinces will rise up and donate a squadron of aircraft each to promote aviation construction, so that we can resist the enemy in the shortest possible time. However, this responsibility relies entirely on the power of the masses and should be demonstrated through practical actions rather than just words.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating briefly that today the Chinese Aviation Association is holding the naming ceremony for the first Shanghai City aircraft. Tiecheng is honored to attend this grand ceremony, and in addition to his joy, he dares to express his most sincere feelings and his deep expectations. A country must have a foundation to stand on. If a country does not have a strong foundation, the nation will lose its guarantee of life. In ancient times, the major affairs of the country were sacrifice and war. Confucius also emphasized "sufficient troops" when discussing politics. Examining the path of development of various countries in modern times and quietly studying the examples of national revival, all are the same. Unfortunately, our people are ignorant of the bond of "peace" and "struggle" and neglect the cultivation of national military power. Living in danger and seeking ease, they do not know how to be invigorated. National defense is lax, and all barriers have been removed. Foreign forces invade and cannot be stopped. Descending to the present day, we are deeply mired in an unprecedented predicament. The Chinese Aviation Association, based on the principle of saving the nation through aviation, supports the government and builds the air force. For several months, they have been running around and appealing, sincerely asking for contributions from all walks of life and generous donations. They have raised huge amounts of funds for national salvation through aviation. Now, the Chinese Aviation Association has ordered eighteen fighter planes from the Curtiss Company in the United States, and the first Shanghai City aircraft will hold a grand and solemn naming ceremony today. This is something we cannot help but feel gratified about. Today, this first Shanghai City aircraft will gallop in the clear sky and initially test its heroism and develop its power. We must know that this first Shanghai City aircraft soaring in the clear sky is the pioneer of our national revolution, the savior of our national life, the new engine of our national self-improvement, and the symbol of our national rejuvenation. All Chinese people must not ignore it. Now, at the time of naming, consider its name [Center: Mrs. Wu (Photo by Li Zunyong) P&gt;</p>
<p>and think of its meaning, mourn the national crisis, and thoroughly recognize the profound and great significance of today's naming ceremony, and think about striving forward. However, since the European War, the air force has been the center of modern national defense plans. World powers are concentrating their financial resources and national power to engage in the construction of the air force. Statistics on the existing air force strength of various countries and the number of aircraft range from more than ten thousand to several thousand. Comparing each other, the strength and weakness are immediately apparent. How can we be complacent with just a few aircraft and should deeply alert ourselves, catch up quickly, and continue our efforts to complete the great cause of saving the nation? As the saying goes, "It is simple to start, but it will be huge to finish." Although we cannot be complacent, we don't need to be discouraged. The survival of the nation and the rise and fall of the country depend on the efforts of the people from now on.</p>
<p>Mayor Unveils the Flag</p>
<p>The Shanghai City aircraft is painted brown, and the wings are yellow. The words "Curtiss Eagle" are written in the middle of the fuselage. The head and both wings are covered with the flags of the Party and the nation. After Mayor Wu finished his speech, he and his wife went down from the stage and stood on the left and right sides in front of the aircraft. Miss Gan Shuxian and Zhang Guiqing also stood in front of the left and right wings. Mayor Wu then made a simple speech and unveiled the flag of the Party and the nation covering the head of the aircraft. At the same time, Miss Gan and Zhang also unveiled the flags of the Party and the nation on the left and right wings, and the naming ceremony ended.</p>
<p>Aircraft Handover Ceremony</p>
<p>After the naming, Chairman Yu Qiaqing presented the aircraft certificate to Director Ge. The upper end of the aircraft certificate was the Premier's will. The middle text stated, "I have found that the state has the right to defend, and individuals have the duty to donate. Now, I respectfully present the Shanghai City fighter plane purchased by this association to the government to defend against insults and protect the people. Each shall fulfill his or her responsibilities, which is the boundless blessing of the Party and the nation. This is the certificate." Below were the signatures of the Chinese Aviation Association and the date. After Ge received the certificate, he gave a speech saying that today, Jing'en represents the government in accepting the fighter plane donated by the Chinese Aviation Association. The enthusiasm of the Shanghai compatriots and all comrades of the Aviation Association for national defense is greatly admired. This aircraft will be designated as the first aircraft of the Air Force Fighter Squadron. He hopes that the public will help the government, and that with the leadership and promotion of all the compatriots in Shanghai and all the colleagues of the Aviation Association, we will go from one aircraft to one squadron, and from one squadron to dozens of squadrons. Jing'en and the Chinese Air Force will surely repay the compatriots of the whole country, make the air defense solid, and the country will no longer suffer losses, and bring our country to a rich and strong region, starting today.</p>
<p>Performing Stunts</p>
<p>After the aircraft handover ceremony, Mayor Wu's wife performed the bottle-breaking ceremony. She gently threw a bottle of champagne at the engine of the aircraft. The champagne splashed everywhere, and the crowd cheered. At 3:15 PM, Major Doolittle finished boarding the aircraft and took off after starting the engine. (1) First, he flew high to ten thousand feet, then gradually descended, performing a straight drop and straight ascent. (2) He performed various spins and inversions at high altitude. (3) He descended again to perform side flight, inverted flight, slow flight, and fast flight. (4) He performed a falling-leaf-style fluttering ascent and descent, without any sound. (5) He performed a sharp-angle turning flight. (6) He performed a body-downward-falling-style flight. The performance lasted about twenty minutes before he gracefully descended. His flying skills had indeed reached the peak, and his amazing stunts were praised by the crowd. At the thrilling parts of the performance, everyone was speechless. When he turned danger into safety and ascended straight into the sky, they stomped their feet and exclaimed.</p>
<p>Mid-Air Jumping Performance</p>
<p>After Doolittle's performance, Curtiss Company prepared another training aircraft, with yellow wings as well, but it could carry two people in the front and rear. American aviator Lewis drove it, and Duxton performed a safe parachute jump. The training aircraft first flew low around the field for a week, scattering flowers in the air to celebrate the success of saving the nation through aviation. Finally, he flew high to more than five thousand feet, and Duxton, with a safety parachute strapped to his back, jumped from the high altitude. The safety parachute immediately opened and floated down, with a beautiful posture. The applause was thunderous. Before long, he safely landed on the racecourse. At exactly 4:00 PM, the various performances ended, and the meeting was adjourned with music.</p>
<p>Flying Back to Longhua</p>
<p>After the aerial performance and the adjournment with music, Major Doolittle still flew the Shanghai City aircraft back to Longhua Airport for parking. According to Ge Jing'en, the director of the Aviation Department who was specially assigned by the central government to receive the aircraft, after the Shanghai City aircraft is received, it will be temporarily parked at Longhua Airport for two or three days. Then, Shen Dexie, the director of the aircraft factory, will fly it to Hangzhou, and after all the repainting is completed, it will be flown to Nanjing and incorporated into the Air Force. He himself will stay in Shanghai for a short time, or return to Hangzhou on the same plane.</p>
<p>Mayor's Remarks</p>
<p>While Major Doolittle was performing stunts in the air, reporters approached Mayor Wu to ask about the price of the order. He replied that the Aviation Association ordered eighteen Hawk fighter planes from the Curtiss Company in the United States, costing approximately US$400,000 and some odd numbers. Currently, the value of the US dollar is slightly lower, so it is roughly equivalent to 1.7 million to 1.8 million Chinese currency. The average price per aircraft is around 100,000 yuan. The remaining seventeen aircraft will be shipped to Shanghai successively before mid-August. Also, when Mr. Duxton performed the safe parachute descent, his posture was very beautiful, and Mayor Wu also clapped his hands and praised it. He told reporters that the safe parachute performance is very risky and cannot be done without rich experience. The price of each safety parachute is approximately US$2,000.</p>
<p>One Aircraft Damaged</p>
<p>After the Curtiss Company's training aircraft completed the first act of its performance on the field, it descended from the western end of the racecourse at 3:50 PM. When it was about to touch the ground, only three or four feet away, it suddenly and inadvertently caused the wheels to touch the low railing of the race track. As a result, the aircraft moved forward and was obstructed. The right wheel immediately broke, and the aircraft fell to the ground. At that moment, the audience was shocked and clamored, rushing forward to see. Member of the Central Committee Kong Xiangxi and Mayor Wu Tiecheng and others, upon hearing the sound, immediately went to investigate. At this time, the pilot, Mr. Lewis, had already smiled and jumped out of the aircraft. Wu and Kong immediately stepped forward to shake hands and express their concern, asking if he was injured. Mr. Lewis smiled and said no. They then inspected the aircraft, and except for the right wheel falling into the small river beside the field, there was no other damage. Thereupon, the crowd was slightly relieved.</p>
<p>One Person Crushed to Death</p>
<p>After the aircraft left, the audience dispersed, and Jiangwan Road became even more crowded. At 4:50 PM, at the corner of Jiangwan Road and Tiyu Association Road, a local accent aged over ten years was injured by a public bus in the crowd and died immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Huang Shaoxiong Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Talks about the Situation in North China</p>
<p>and the Ceasefire Negotiations</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Minister of the Interior Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and returned to his new residence on West Aixin Road to rest. A Central News Agency reporter went to ask him about the recent situation in North China and the process of signing the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement. He answered in detail. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Central Government Will Issue a Declaration</p>
<p>Mr. Huang said that he had reported on the recent situation in North China at the Lushan Conference on his trip south to Xun, but he did not participate in the meeting, so he did not know the details of the meeting. However, according to what he knew, after the signing of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, the central government will issue a declaration within days, reporting in detail the process of signing the Sino-Japanese ceasefire, so that the whole country can fully understand.</p>
<p>The Agreement Did Not Involve Politics</p>
<p>The ceasefire agreement has been formally signed. According to what he knew about the negotiations, the representatives of both sides were all military personnel, and no political representatives attended. The scope of the discussion was limited to military affairs and did not involve politics. Huang Yongbai, the chairman of the Political Affairs Sorting Committee stationed in Peiping, was only in an assisting position in the ceasefire negotiations and did not participate in the negotiations. The rumors were all speculation. The first article of the agreement stipulates that the Chinese army shall withdraw from Yanqing, Changping, Gaoliying, Shunyi, Tongzhou, Xianghe, Baodi, Linyin, Ninghe, Lutai, and the area west and south of the line connected by them and shall not advance. In fact, most of the above-mentioned locations have been occupied by the Japanese army. As for the security of the area about a hundred miles south of the Great Wall, it is maintained by the local authorities with police force.</p>
<p>The Northeast Issue Was Not Discussed</p>
<p>The ceasefire negotiations have now come to an end. The rumors that the ceasefire negotiations were carried out in two steps, the first step being military in nature and the second step being political in nature, were unknown to him. The Northeast issue was not discussed in this ceasefire negotiation. In the future, China and Japan may conduct separate negotiations to resolve the outstanding issues between China and Japan, but he dare not predict this. However, the ceasefire negotiations in North China have now come to an end, and there is no so-called "second step" of negotiation.</p>
<p>Three Hopes for the Future</p>
<p>Mr. Huang also said that because our army's combat equipment is far inferior to that of the enemy, although we resisted to the death, we did not achieve the goal of recovering lost territory. As a last resort, we negotiated a ceasefire. Now the war has temporarily come to an end. We can only hope for (1) rectifying military affairs, because our military aircraft are all old-fashioned, and even fighting with broadswords against artillery fire, the outcome of the battle can be known without fighting. Therefore, without immediate rectification, it is not enough to resist strong enemies. (2) Solidarity between the upper and lower levels. Now our people's hearts are scattered, which is enough to invite foreign insults. If we are determined to resist the enemy, we cannot do it without solidarity between the upper and lower levels. (3) Recognizing the country. The people should understand the government's measures and intentions, and unity between the upper and lower levels can be realized. The above three items, he hopes that the government and the people will pay attention to them together.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese War Does Not Advocate Empty Talk</p>
<p>Member of the Central Committee Feng Yuxiang recently telegraphed to take office as the commander-in-chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. Huang said that he did not know what the central government's attitude was, and he did not know whether it had been discussed at the Lushan Conference. In short, the anti-Japanese work is in practice, not in chanting slogans. Furthermore, if Feng is determined to resist Japan, why not implement it earlier, and wait until the anti-Japanese armies are all exhausted and unable to fight before mobilizing, it seems too late. The situation in Chahar is currently extremely chaotic. Chairman Song of Chahar Province is now busy rescuing the wounded and caring for the dead. It is incomprehensible that Feng has arbitrarily changed the chairman of Chahar Province. Mr. Huang did not want to express his opinion on the Southwest issue. He has not decided when to go north again. However, he knew that Mr. Huang would stay in Shanghai for about two or three days.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Ma Xiangbo and Zhang Taiyan Telegraphically Encourage Feng Yuxiang <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Following the People of the Whole Country</p>
<p>As a Backing for Your Service</p>
<p>Ninety-four-year-old Ma Xiangbo and national scholar Zhang Taiyan sympathized with Feng Yuxiang's anti-Japanese proposition in the telegram, and sent a telegram to Zhangjiakou to express their condolences and encouragement. The original text is recorded below: To Commander-in-Chief Feng Huanzhang of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army of the People of Zhangjiakou, I have received your telegram. Japan is showing its insatiable desire, and the ashes of Manchuria are burning again. The authorities regard it as a minor skin disease that cannot be cured. The internal organs are all decayed. He will not discuss the others. Even in the city of Beiping, the Japanese soldiers who have entered are two thousand five hundred, even searching houses and patrolling the East City. Our military police retreat with caution. Is it still said that Beiping has not been lost? If the compromise is quickly reached and the Japanese soldiers temporarily retreat, but the heavy door is wide open, and there is no restriction on coming and going, in just a few years, the area north of the Yellow River will be occupied by the enemy. The people can't bear it and appeal to you. You respond to the urgent demands with a firm character. Although the start is late, it meets the times. Although the place is small, it is connected to the hearts of the people. The one who mourns wins in battle. You and the people of Chahar Province can be said to be the ones who mourn. If the defense of Chahar is solid, it must ensure that the facilities in North China are complete before we can rely on it without fear. Then, if the east has not been determined in Shenyang and the north has not been recovered in Rehe, there is no time when we are not in mourning. Japan has been a disaster in the east for forty years. The invasion of Manchuria has had Chinese soil for more than two hundred and ninety years. Fortunately, during the Xinhai Revolution, the people cooperated to restore the old things. Although the harm of Manchuria has been removed, the disaster of Japan has not been eliminated. Now, due to the authorities' negligence, the two thieves are working together, endangering the Olympic area. If this is not treated, it is not only ignoring foreign troubles, but also completely abandoning the merits of the Xinhai Revolution. You have been involved in the uprising in Luozhou for more than thirty years and have not forgotten the old things. You have gathered righteous people and used white cloth as funds. The place you occupy, Chahar, was originally the old commandery of Yunzhong Dingxiang in the Qin and Han dynasties of the Seven Kingdoms. How is it different from Guo Fenyang's uprising in Shuofang? Your heart is enough to represent the hearts of those who have blood in the whole country. Your words are enough to represent the words of those who have blood in the whole country. Your actions will be able to thoroughly lead the actions of those who have blood in the whole country. Although some are in their twilight years, if there is still a breath left, they will follow the people of the whole country as a backing for your service. Only uphold righteousness and move forward, and do not look around at all. Ma Liang, Zhang Binglin,</p>

<p>The Datong Music Society of Shanghai, after its first joint performance with Western music at the Grand Theater the day before yesterday, although not a failure, had fewer members in its orchestra than the Western orchestra. Moreover, the society has more than 180 kinds of musical instruments and of course wants to make them all sound, so as not to lose the original intention of manufacturing them. In the future, there will be a second joint performance of Chinese and Western orchestras. Based on these two reasons, it is really necessary to expand the orchestra. Cultivating talents is especially urgent. The Society plans to upgrade the qualifications of its existing members (awarding prizes, giving certificates, and recommending them to serve as national music educators in schools) and re-establish new regulations. In the future, new members joining the Datong Orchestra must first serve as students for five months of study and pass the grades of various musical instruments stipulated by the society before they can join. It has now started recruiting 100 students and is scheduled to start registration on June 1st and officially start classes on the 11th. The musical notation used is edited with a comparison of staff notation and gongche notation for each instrument, with basic exercises for each. The guqin and pipa are used as regular courses, and the monthly fee is 5 yuan (including lecture notes and instrument fees). The regulations can be obtained from the Society. Those who aspire to national music should not miss this opportunity.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic Donations from Each Team</p>
<p>Extension Scheduled to Start in June</p>
<p>The first and second announcements of the solicitation of construction donations by the Pudong Association have already been reported. Now it is the time for the third settlement. In addition to the 60,000 yuan already received from each hall team, the 40,000 yuan already received from each room team, and the 15,000 yuan already paid by ordinary teams, the number of those who have reported their donations but have not yet paid and are continuing to solicit donations is still the majority. For example, the third hall team has successively solicited and paid or reported amounts such as 3,000 yuan each from Gu Lanzhou, Tao Guisong, Shen Defu, and Lu Songfang, 3,000 yuan jointly from Ling Yunzhou and Zhao Zengtao, and 3,000 yuan jointly from Ding Jiayan and Ding Gengyao, etc., 2,000 yuan each from Chen Sanlin and Cai Runsen, and 1,000 yuan each from Zhang Zhuxi, Ling Xiufeng, Xia Anbang, Xue Meiquan, Cai Boliang, Tao Rangqing, Lu Wenmei, Zhang Fukang, Lian Wenbing, and Mrs. Huang Wang, etc. Mr. Zhang Yugong and Mr. Hu Chenggui each donated 1,000 yuan through their sons to commemorate them. Zhu Muyu, Ding Zigan, Song Laqu, Cai Guisong, Bao Pingqing, Lu Zhuping, Zhang Shaotang, Zhang Jinghan, and other sages, as well as Xi Liangji, Xia Yongtai, Wang Gongyi, and Wang Gongxing, etc., were all donated by their descendants, totaling 12 households at 1,000 yuan each, Sheng Jingming, Wang Xinyi, and Wang Jingqing, at 500 yuan each, Xi Zhengliang and Xi Peibin jointly donated 500 yuan, Gu Jialin and Gu Renjie jointly donated 500 yuan, Feng Yixiang donated 400 yuan, and Wu Haikun and Cao Zhongbin each donated 250 yuan. There are many households donating 100 yuan each. Moreover, most of the team leaders have not settled and reported the numbers. Based on the above households alone, the third hall team is close to 50,000 yuan, and the second hall team should be more than the third hall team. Moreover, the first hall team pays double the amount of the most donated team. There are also special teams that are continuing to progress. It is now scheduled to extend the solicitation from June and collect membership fees. It is expected that the final total will exceed the predetermined amount of 400,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Record of the Annual Meeting of the Taishan Insurance Company <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xinliu Gives a Speech</p>
<p>The Taishan Insurance Company at No. 2 Beijing Road is the only sound insurance company organized with Chinese capital. It has been operating various types of water, fire, life, and accident insurance businesses since it opened in the autumn of last year. The company convened its first annual shareholders' meeting the day before yesterday on the second floor of the company. All shareholders attended. In addition to reporting various accounts, business conditions, and passing various motions (omitted), Mr. Xu Xinliu, chairman of the company, gave a detailed report. The recording of his speech is as follows: "Distinguished shareholders, today is the first annual shareholders' meeting of our company. I am very happy to be able to gather with all of you and report on the company's financial results and all other circumstances. Our company has only been in existence for five months since the capital was fully paid up on August 1 last year and the company was established. The actual start of business was on September 21, and it has only been a little more than three months until the end of the year. The time is very short, so the accounts presented to you today only represent the activities of more than three months and have not been able to fully express the company's operating conditions. Although the company's business hours were only more than three months, the progress was quite smooth. Within three months, the total premium income reached 75,014 yuan, 9 jiao, and 8 fen. For a company that has just been founded, it seems to be a considerable number in a very short period of time, and it is reassuring to all shareholders. Now, I would like to report the company's business policy and the calculation of donations, the balance sheet of assets and liabilities, etc. as follows: The company's original business has four types: water insurance, fire insurance, accident insurance, and life insurance. The Board of Directors and the executives agree that the business policy should be to develop all four businesses equally, and it is not appropriate to focus on one type. Therefore, all premium income should be weighed according to the circumstances and balanced, and not concentrated on any one party. Please divide the situation of the four businesses and report them separately. Fire insurance is an important part of the insurance business, and our company will naturally operate it with the utmost care. However, in the past, Chinese insurance companies have tended to focus on this one way, resulting in fierce competition and repeated reductions in premium prices. At the same time, the solicitation of orders must also be done with the utmost caution. Now, our company's business policy, although paying great attention to fire insurance, is not biased towards it, in order to achieve parallel progress. The water insurance item is currently only doing foreign business. The executive department believes that Chinese companies have a lot of room for development in this business. The accident insurance part can get income immediately, and it is a stable and good business in the insurance industry. However, it is still in the experimental stage, and the risk of operating it alone is relatively large. It is better to contact the same industry and work together, then the strength will be great, the effect will be fast, and the risk will be less. Therefore, our company is now jointly operated by several insurance companies in this port, in order to be stable and reliable. Life insurance can not only seek security for the insured and their families, but also absorb scattered funds to create huge funds for the revitalization of various industries. It can be said that the method is good and the meaning is beautiful. However, this kind of insurance in our country is not very developed. Among the 400 million people, the number of insured is still less than 30,000. If we can solicit it properly, the future hope is very high. Therefore, our company pays very close attention to this kind of insurance. In the three-month period of this financial settlement, we have received an insured amount of 514,000 yuan, and the solicitation cost is only 8,698 yuan, 8 jiao, and 3 fen, which seems to be worthwhile. The reserves for the above-mentioned fire insurance, water insurance, and accident insurance departments have been clarified and burdened in accordance with the contract, and the outstanding capital has been withdrawn as of December 31, and the accounting is accurate, which is sufficient to cope with all claims responsibilities. There is profit and no deficit, and its life insurance reserves are handled in accordance with the American death table. The first year's premium is used as a calculation system for term insurance, and is provided in full, and a weekly interest rate of 3.5% is guaranteed, which can be said to have a completely reliable guarantee for the interests of the insured. As for the profit and loss statement, this term originally had no losses and should be listed as surplus, but there are no loss and surplus items in the book, because our company should first consolidate its foundation when it was first founded. Therefore, all the benefits were allocated to the start-up costs, providing sufficient reserves, and eliminating the cost of generating wealth, decoration, and annual depreciation of 50%, etc. In this way, the foundation is solid, and it will be easier to succeed in future development. This method must be approved by all shareholders. Also, in this term, the cash item in the liability schedule is quite large, because the time is very short during this period, and the situation is not very stable, so we did not dare to invest rashly, so there is this temporary phenomenon. However, the amount invested in this term has also increased slightly, totaling 3,017 yuan, 3 jiao, and 8 fen. This increase has been transferred to the investment change reserve. The company's investment list and report card are all recorded, and you can read them to understand them. Also, during this period, although there were very few compensation events, the agents' commissions were paid in advance, and at the same time, premium reserves had to be provided. At the time of closing, the policies were not yet mature, and the premiums that had not yet expired were not listed in the accounts. Therefore, the income and expenditure seem to be not very balanced. This is the phenomenon that should exist in the trend of events. Added attachments, in addition, there are incidental reports, which are that all the service personnel of the company, all the staff of the executive department, are familiar with their efforts and loyal to their duties, which is deeply gratifying and grateful to the company, and can be reported to all shareholders. However, the wisdom of neighbors and others is short-sighted, and I hope that all shareholders will not hesitate to give guidance at any time.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Nuo Na Living Buddha, Wang Yiting, Ye Yufu, Dharma Master Renshan, and Dharma Master Yuanying were publicly elected as chairmen of the presidium. Wang Junhe acted as master of ceremonies, and Wu Xiaoshao as recorder. First, Chairman Yuanying reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly: "Today, our association is holding the fifth National Buddhist Representatives Assembly. We are honored to have Party and government representatives present to guide us. The progress of our association's affairs is closely related to internal affairs. Director Lu has always had faith in Buddhism and has considerable knowledge of it. He can be described as secretly practicing the bodhisattva path and outwardly appearing as a high official. If we Buddhists can unite as one, work hard, seek development for Buddhism, and seek benefits for the country and society, and carry out the Buddhist Mahayana world-saving purpose, we should be impartial and eliminate personal prejudices. In the future, we should elect outstanding talents to handle everything. Then, this association will be a Buddhist life-saving boat. If we can find a powerful tugboat, this boat can steadily ferry believers without capsizing. This is my sincere hope."</p>
<p>Guest Speeches</p>
<p>Next, Lu Xirong, Director of the Department of Rites and Customs of the Ministry of Interior, gave a training speech, stating briefly: "Buddhism entered China thousands of years ago and has a deep relationship with China's inherent culture. Its principles are bright and upright, and its teachings are profound and extensive, surpassing any other religion. However, later generations of Buddhists, ignorant of the great meaning, have regarded Buddhism as empty and缥缈, as a way to escape the world. They do not know that our Buddha, with a great fearless spirit, embraces the enthusiasm to save the world and all living beings, without competing for gain and loss, and with equality between enemies and relatives. This has been clearly instructed in the teachings. I hope that in the future, we will pay attention to the following points: (1) self-awareness and awakening others, (2) saving the country and the world, (3) actively promoting social work, so that Buddhism can flourish and become the only treasure to save the world, remedy society, and universally liberate all living beings." He also hoped that the executive committee members would work hard without fear of difficulties or retreat. If their strength is insufficient, the government will provide full assistance. Mao Yun, representative of the Central People's Sports Meeting, and Chen Lengseng, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, also gave training speeches. Next, Mingdao, Dabei, Zhao Yunshao, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Jianliu, and others spoke. Next, Yuanying gave a reply. (The speech is omitted for brevity). Because it was noon, a recess was announced.

<h3 id="e100">After Sino-Russian Trade, National Vessels Navigate to Vladivostok <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Zhongwei Shunfeng Wheel</p>
<p>First Ship to Russia</p>
<p>Trial Voyage</p>
<p>Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, more and more Soviet goods have been imported into China. The Soviet merchant fleet has sent six ships to and from Shanghai and Vladivostok. Recently, a large number of Russian goods such as wood, Kimura glass, and flower-labeled kerosene have been shipped to Shanghai. Besides Russian ships, no other country's merchant ships operate on this route. Mr. Chen Shuntong, the owner of the Huashang Zhongwei Wheel Company, recently decided to operate the company's new Shunfeng ship, which has a load capacity of 8,000 tons and is most suitable for sailing on the outer sea route, on the Sino-Russian route, taking advantage of the beginning of Sino-Russian trade. The first trial voyage to Vladivostok, loading cargo to and from, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai today. The route will take it to Lushun, Dalian, Japan, and then to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Loading Wood</p>
<p>The Shunfeng ship is very large. This time, it is sailing to Vladivostok to transport 1.8 million cubic feet of Russian wood purchased by Shanghai Chinese merchants to Shanghai, as well as other Russian goods. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Vladivostok today. Because the shipping schedule is tight, no goods are being shipped from Shanghai. Many goods bound for Russia will be unloaded in Lushun. Mr. Chen has telegraphed the manager in Lushun to prepare.</p>
<p>Prohibitions</p>
<p>The Shunfeng ship is the first national vessel to sail on the Sino-Russian route after the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Vladivostok's inspection of foreign ships entering the port is very strict. Crew members are not allowed to bring any items ashore. Even spare items on board must be reported in advance. Any omissions will be fined. After arriving in Vladivostok, only Russian currency can be used, but it is forbidden to privately export Russian gold coins. Violators will be severely punished. Yesterday, Mr. Chen Shuntong thoroughly informed the crew of these details of entering Vladivostok and instructed them to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Tong Baoren Assassinated <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Sudden Attack by Seven Thugs</p>
<p>Wife Screams for Help After Husband Dies</p>
<p>Tong Baoren, a native of Shaoxing, 44 years old, has been running the Yongli Dyeing Workshop at No. 97, Lane 2, Puyu East Road, outside Dananmen, Nanshi, for more than ten years. Because Tong is honest and hardworking, his business has been quite successful. Yesterday morning around 5:00 AM, when the workers in the workshop had already gotten up and were working in the workshop, seven thugs suddenly arrived. Two of them guarded the gate, and the rest broke into the workshop. The leader, wearing a gray cloth gown, about twenty years old, speaking with a Shaoxing accent, seemed afraid of being recognized, so he wore a pair of black glasses on his nose. He pointed a pistol and drove the workers to a corner, forbidding them from making any noise, and left two people to monitor them. They went straight into Tong's bedroom. At that time, Tong happened to be sleeping in the same bed with his wife, Ms. Xie, and had not yet gotten up. However, the thugs were very familiar with the situation in the workshop. After breaking into Tong's bedroom, they went straight to Tong's bedside. When they lifted the bed curtain, Tong had already woken up. He immediately sat up and asked, "What are you doing here?" He tried to get up and grab the thug, but the thug immediately pulled the trigger and fired a shot at Tong. There was a crisp sound, and the bullet entered Tong's left breast and exited from his left waist. He was injured instantly, bleeding profusely. He screamed miserably, fell back on the bed, and died. Ms. Xie was sitting next to Tong and was shocked to see this tragic scene. She screamed for help on the bed. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, strode out and left with their accomplices in the workshop, fleeing towards Dananmen. Afterwards, Ms. Xie immediately reported the situation to the Third Precinct of the First District. After hearing the report, Chief Jin immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to search everywhere, but it had been a long time, and the thugs had already fled far away, so they did not catch them. Later, Police Chief Wang Zuoxian was sent to investigate the workshop. In Tong's bedroom, they found a white Lysol pistol bullet casing. According to Tong's wife, the deceased had no enemies outside, so the reason for the murder was really unclear. She reported the situation to the chief. Because the case was bizarre and involved human life, in addition to ordering the arrest of the murderer, the twenty-third patrolman Qin Defang was dispatched to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Fifth District of the County Petitions for Establishment of Branch Hospital <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the magistrate of the fifth district of Shanghai County, yesterday submitted a document to Cao, the Administrative Inspector of the Fifth District of Jiangsu Province and concurrent County Magistrate, petitioning to forward a letter to the Public Shanghai Hospital, requesting the establishment of a branch hospital within the jurisdiction of the district to benefit the poor and sick and to care for the lives of the people. The district established a free medical clinic for the poor last summer, and hundreds of people from far and wide come to seek medical treatment every day. However, it is limited to various departments of traditional Chinese medicine. When there are acute infectious diseases, it is often difficult to treat them, and people are forced to wait for death. It is not as effective as the precise and rapid surgery of Western medicine, which is a pity. Since the beginning of this summer, seasonal diseases have been rampant. Although there is a long-standing wish to continue running the free clinic, it is impossible to raise funds due to the lack of public funds. Recently, I heard that your office sent a letter to the Public Shanghai Hospital, requesting the establishment of a branch hospital in the town of Beiqiao in Puxi, so that all districts under the county can receive the benefits. There is nothing but joy. However, the district is far away from the Pujiang River. If there are strong winds and waves, it is inconvenient to cross the river. Moreover, it is more than twenty miles away from Beiqiao Town, making it difficult to reach after a long journey. If there is an acute illness, it will inevitably be too late to treat it, and there will still be the tragic scene of waiting for death. The district magistrate, seeing this, could not remain silent, so he dared to speak for the people, requesting that your excellency treat everyone equally and approve the forwarding of a letter to the Public Shanghai Hospital, requesting that it also establish a branch hospital in the fifth district, so as to popularize it and care for the lives of the people, which would be a public virtue and convenient for both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Child Dies After Mother Feeds Opium Dregs for Diarrhea; Police Charge Mother with Murder <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yao Ma, the wife of local coppersmith Yao Quan'gen, who lives at No. 14, Lane 68, Rue du Père Robert, in the French Concession, on the previous day, because her ten-month-old son Xinglin suffered from persistent diarrhea, sought opium dregs at home and fed them to the child with boiling water in the hope of curing the disease. Unexpectedly, he swallowed an excessive amount and was poisoned. He was sent to the hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. He died that evening. The hospital reported to the police station, who took the child's body to the autopsy room. After the court confirmed the autopsy, the body was collected for burial. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the police station believes that the child's mother, Yao Ma, was ignorant and, instead of seeking medical treatment, rashly fed the child the poisonous opium dregs, causing his death. For the criminal responsibility she should bear for homicide, and to warn ignorant women in general to prevent future occurrences, a detective was specially dispatched to arrest Yao Ma and send her to the Second Special District Court for investigation yesterday. At 2:30 PM, the criminal division chief Wang Kaixu presided over the interrogation in the first criminal court. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case and prosecuted according to Article 291 of the Criminal Code. Yao Ma confessed that the deceased was her own son, Xinglin. Because he had diarrhea, it gradually became severe. She heard people say that opium dregs could stop diarrhea, so she sought them and fed them to the child, but unexpectedly, it caused a great disaster. She begged for leniency. The court verified the confession and ordered that the announcement of the verdict be postponed. The defendant was returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank has been operating very well since it built a large building at No. 64 Hankou Road. The bank's savings department, due to the increasing progress of its business, found that the original site was insufficient for use.

<p>Chang Yaokui, the manager of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, recently resigned due to illness. The board of directors approved the resignation and appointed Qi Zhi, the assistant manager and manager of the Shanghai branch, to succeed him as general manager, while also continuing to serve as manager of the Shanghai branch. He assumed office on the first of this month. It is said that Mr. Qi studied in France for many years and served as the chargé d'affaires of the embassy in France. After returning to China, he served as the manager of the Shanghai branch of the bank for several years and achieved considerable success. Mr. Qi is young and energetic, astute and steady. It is also said that the bank's operations will be subject to a measured change in the system, roughly shifting from a general manager system to a board system. The chairman and managing directors of the bank are Li Shizeng, Zhang Gongquan, Fang Yaoting, Wang Gancheng, and Wei Bocong, who are either well-known figures in the political arena or famous figures in the financial world. With their cooperation with Mr. Qi, there will inevitably be a new atmosphere, and the bank will become more successful day by day.</p>

<p>Elderly, Middle-Aged, and Young: Jumping into the Huangpu River One After Another</p>
<p>Representing Three Stages... Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>Although All Were Rescued... Efforts Should Be Made for Aftercare</p>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent cases of people committing suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River due to negative views. Yesterday, three more men jumped into the river to end their lives. Fortunately, all were rescued. The reasons are mostly due to economic pressure, leading them to this end. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Doddery Old Man</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday, a doddery old man suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River at the Lan Nidu Ferry in Pudong when others were not paying attention. The pier police officer immediately discovered this and directed nearby ferrymen to rescue him. He was taken to the Third District and identified as Zhang Wenmin, 61 years old, from Hunan. He recently came to Shanghai from his hometown by boat, but was unsuccessful in finding a job that his friends promised to get him. His travel expenses were exhausted, and he had no means of living, so he had to sacrifice his old life to avoid becoming a starving ghost. He was in tears, and his condition was extremely pitiful. A suicide note was found next to him, stating that he was committing suicide due to environmental pressure and requesting that if anyone retrieved his body, they should collect it on his behalf. The district magistrate ordered him to be sent to the General Bureau for Relief.</p>
<p>Robust Young Man</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, a robust young man hired a sampan at the French Concession Company Wharf, stating that he was going to the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. When they arrived at Pudongxin, he suddenly jumped into the water to end his life. The sampan man quickly rescued him and sent him to the Customs Water Police Station. He identified himself as Li Dezhong, 24 years old, from Fuyang. He had been unemployed in his hometown for a long time, so he obtained some travel expenses and came to Shanghai to seek work. However, for three consecutive days, he had no place to live, and his travel expenses were exhausted. He had no face to return home, so he became disillusioned with the world. He said that he had a friend in Shanghai, living on Da Minguo Road. The police chief immediately sent someone to take him to his friend's place for relief.</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Man</p>
<p>At 1:30 PM yesterday, a middle-aged man boarded the Kunshan Maru, a small head ferry of the Nissin Company, at the Wuma Road Wharf, seemingly heading to Pudong. Unexpectedly, when the ship was heading south near Xiaodongmen on the Huangpu River, the man jumped into the raging waves to end his life. Fortunately, the old boatman Miao Sheng discovered him, and the ship immediately turned around and sailed back to rescue him. Seeing that the man's body sank and floated again, he used a bamboo pole to hook him onto the ship and sent him to the Customs Water Police Station. It was observed that he had scabies and was very smelly. When asked about the reason for his suicide, he said that his name was Zhao Zuguang, 31 years old, from Ningbo. He used to work at the Gold Exchange, but due to bad friends, he gradually became depraved and lost his job. Recently, he has also been suffering from sores and lodging in a small inn in Mantingfang. His finances are becoming increasingly difficult, and his illness cannot be cured. He thinks that there is no interest in being a human being, and it is better to die early. He has a mother and an older brother, and his wife has passed away. The police chief ordered that his relatives be notified to take him home.</p>
<h3 id="e112">China Chemical Industry Society Hosts Chrysanthemum Garden Tour Group <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Overthrow the Poppy, Which Harms the Country and the People</p>
<p>Promote Pyrethrum, Which Enriches the Country and Benefits the People</p>
<p>In order to make the people understand the importance of the pyrethrum business and to arouse the interest of all sectors in planting, the China Chemical Industry Society specially invited people from all walks of life to Anlangdu the day before yesterday to visit the society's chrysanthemum garden. In one day, more than 400 people registered to join, which shows the interest of all sectors in the pyrethrum business.</p>
<p>Participants Those who participated were mostly celebrities from agricultural, commercial, academic, and other fields. Individuals who registered to participate included Wang Hanqiang, Huang Jingwan, Gu Xingyi, Lin Dazhong, and others. Groups and organizations that participated included the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Mechanical Industry Association, the Shiguang Farm, the Commodity Exhibition Hall, the Home Industry Society, the China National Products Company, and the China Chemical Research Institute. There were also more than ten women who joined.</p>
<p>Departure Situation At the time of departure, the company specially rented more than 60 cars from the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company. Each car had a flag with the slogan "Go to the Countryside". The cars were lined up in order on Avenue Edward VII, stretching from Jiangxi Road to near the Great World, winding like a long snake. There were also many guests who brought their own cars.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Farm The farm is located in Anlangdu, west of Shanghai, about five or six miles from the Beixinjing station. The chrysanthemum garden is about 200 mu. The flowers were in full bloom at the time. Hundreds of village women and children were picking flowers in the fields. The ten thousand flowers were in full bloom, stretching as far as the eye could see, which was a magnificent sight. They also went to the management area, where the society had posted many slogans, such as "Overthrow the poppy, which harms the country and the people, and promote pyrethrum, which enriches the country and benefits the people." The words were very sharp and vigilant. Many dried flowers were being dried around. It is said that if it rains, they must be dried using scientific methods. After the tour, a group photo was taken in the flowers to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>Distribution of Gifts Along the way, the society sent people to distribute various gifts, including fans, pyrethrum cultivation methods, the society's 20th anniversary commemorative publications, and the society's products such as white jade toothpaste and disinfectant soap. The society also set up a cool shed in the farm, with soda, tea, and other refreshments. The guests were tired from the journey, and seeing the soda and tea, they all rushed to eat, which was a lively and interesting scene. It was already noon when they returned.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Report on the Shaanxi Disaster Investigation by the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Over Three Million Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Rural Areas on the Verge of Extinction</p>
<p>Without Huge Sums of Money</p>
<p>This Extraordinary Disaster Cannot Be Saved</p>
<p>Will Benevolent and Charitable People Please Come Forward?</p>
<p>The drought in Shaanxi Province began in the first year of the Republic of China and has persisted for five years without relief. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in history. Although the local Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee has repeatedly remitted funds for disaster relief, reports of the disaster continue to arrive like snowflakes. The committee deeply feels helpless and, on May 13th, dispatched Vice-Chairman Mr. Gu Jisheng, along with General Secretary Mr. Ou Yongkang, and others to Shaanxi for investigation. Mr. Gu and his party have recently returned to Shanghai and reported the disaster conditions as follows:</p>
<p>Historical Disaster Conditions: The province experienced a severe drought for three years starting in the 17th year of the Republic of China, resulting in vast stretches of barren land and no harvest. Farmers originally had scarce savings, and after three years, the situation became unmanageable. The disaster was most severe in the western region of Guanzhong, followed by the eastern region, and then northern Shaanxi. Initially, people could survive by eating grass roots and tree bark, but eventually, even these were exhausted, and countless people starved to death. Although there were disaster relief funds from various sources, the disaster was too severe and the funds were insufficient, like using a cup of water to put out a burning cartload of firewood, which was of no avail. According to investigations by the authorities, the number of disaster victims in the province crying out for food reached more than 3,345,000, accounting for three-fifths of the province's population. The so-called "mournful cries of refugees fill the land" truly describes the situation in Shaanxi.</p>
<p>This Year's Disaster Conditions</p>
<p>At the beginning of spring this year, another severe drought struck, and the wheat seedlings that had been planted were on the verge of dying. Fortunately, in the late spring of March, abundant rain fell, and the withering wheat seedlings revived and flourished. There was great hope for a summer harvest, which could slightly relieve the distress. Unexpectedly, at the end of April and beginning of May, just when the wheat ears were forming, fierce winds arrived, accompanied by flying stones and sand. The warm climate suddenly turned frigid, and repeated black frosts descended. Wherever the frost reached, the stems and leaves withered, and the glimmer of hope was extinguished once again. More than ten counties north of the Wei River still had no harvest. The farmers suffered this extraordinary hardship, and cries of disaster filled the roads. Unable to survive, some hanged themselves in the fields. Alas, how tragic!</p>
<p>The Tragic State of Rural Villages: The rural villages of Shaanxi Province were originally very prosperous. Since the great drought, not only have the rural villages gone bankrupt, but they have been virtually annihilated. Initially, there was hope that the coming year might bring a turn for the better and a bountiful harvest, so people endured death and waited. However, the drought in the coming years only worsened. After three or four years, many people died. While most starved to death, many also died from epidemics. During the summer, when epidemics broke out, when one person died, their body was left in the wild, and their clothes were stripped, causing the epidemic to spread uncontrollably. Entire families died from the plague, and such cases were numerous. Consequently, the young and strong fled in droves. In the severely affected areas now, there are often no more than five or six families in a village, and those who remain are on the verge of death. Selling people has become commonplace. Married women fetch only two yuan each, and unmarried women only thirteen yuan. Farm families have no possessions left. Once the people are gone, only the timber can still be exchanged for money. So, regardless of the consequences, they tear down houses and cut down trees to prolong their lives for a few more days. Farming tools are the lifeline of farmers, but they are forced to sell them at a low price. At present, in the city of Xi'an, shops selling old timber and old farm implements are everywhere. Therefore, even if there is no further drought in the summer and autumn this year, farmers will have no seeds or tools and will be unable to cultivate the land. The tragic state of the rural villages has reached such a point; it is truly a great calamity.</p>
<p>Severe Disaster, Insufficient Funds: The severity of the disaster is roughly as described above. Seeking to remedy the situation is extremely difficult. The first priority is to prolong the lives of those who have not yet died. Generally, two or three yuan per person can sustain them for a month or two. Although the cost is very low, there are so many disaster victims that it cannot be done without a large sum of money. The second priority is to purchase seeds and farm implements to enable the farmers to resume their work. Otherwise, even if heaven sends timely rain, the farmers can only sigh and lament. The disaster area is extraordinarily vast, and it cannot be handled without a large sum of money. While in Xi'an, Mr. Gu and his party urgently telegraphed the committee to remit 10,000 yuan to purchase farm implements on a large scale to alleviate the immediate crisis. However, such a small amount is of little help. It is hoped that benevolent and charitable people will generously donate funds and pool together a large sum. Only then can the disaster in Shaanxi be slightly alleviated, and the hope for the survival of the people of Shaanxi will not be extinguished.</p>
<p>Jinghui Canal Project: Shaanxi Province has a high terrain, and its water conservancy is poorly maintained. The livelihood of the farmers depends entirely on the heavens. If it does not rain, death is certain. However, forests are scarce, and the existing trees are cut down without replanting. The possibility of rainfall decreases with each passing day. A certain Westerner predicted that Shaanxi Province might turn into a desert in the future. While this may not be entirely credible, it is not without reason for concern. The fundamental solution is to construct water conservancy projects to ensure irrigation for farmland. This is why the Jinghui Canal project is so important. At present, the Jinghui Canal project is 80-90% complete, irrigating over a million mu of farmland. However, the original plan to open up various branch canals, if successfully completed, would irrigate three to four million mu more than the existing canal. Now, due to a shortage of funds, it is impossible to proceed. Some people have contacted the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee to request funds to undertake the construction of branch canals, which would cost approximately 100,000 yuan. The committee is not without the intention to undertake this, but the funds are not yet secured. It remains to be seen whether they can be raised, and it also relies on philanthropists to have compassion for this great disaster and donate large sums of money.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Seeking Education or Joining the Military <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Zhou Minan of Shaoxing</p>
<p>Answer: The answers to the two questions you asked are as follows: (1) Given your difficult circumstances and inability to make ends meet, it is logically difficult to have the opportunity to pursue education. However, this is based on general circumstances. If you can truly utilize your environment, you can seek education anytime and anywhere, without necessarily having to enter middle school or university. The youth who attend middle school and university are mostly the children of middle-class or higher families. A poor youth like you naturally has no place among them. However, precisely because of this, the knowledge and education acquired by the children of the poor are exceptionally rich in content. For example, a poor child who knows the suffering of not being able to study due to lack of money can thus realize that, in order to enable all poor children to have access to education, it is necessary to work hard to transform the social roots of poverty. Or, for example, a poor child who has seen and personally experienced the exploitation by local tyrants, evil gentry, corrupt officials, and bureaucrats in the countryside can thus realize that, in order to relieve farmers from suffering, it is necessary to fundamentally transform the rural areas. All of these are knowledge and education that middle school and university students can never obtain in classrooms or books. In a period of great change, the cultural level of the people, especially the cultural level of revolutionaries, cannot be measured by school education but must be assessed by the progressive course of their social life. Having said this, I want to encourage you to take heart. You are capable of seeking education, but this kind of learning is not to be sought in schools but in the daily struggles of social life. This is the first question. (2) "Pingjin is in danger." Instead of committing suicide, it is better to join the military. This approach can be taken under the following conditions: First, the organizers and commanders of this army, as well as their usual education and training, must truly possess a revolutionary spirit of anti-imperialism and national defense, and they must have resolute action. Second, otherwise, the person joining the military must have deep foresight, loyalty, courage, and steadfastness, what is called "leaving the easy for the difficult," what is called "entangling roots and intertwined branches." If the army you join can truly resolutely resist, then you may charge into the enemy, die generously, use your blood to resist foreign enemies, and awaken the national soul. If the army you join is not a revolutionary army but flees at the sight of the enemy, then you must unite the people and fight to the death with the invading army of imperialists. The heroic and great education given to us by the citizens of Paris in 1871 is clearly visible. Even if you are crushed to pieces, you can die with your eyes closed in peace. However, now that the North has already negotiated a ceasefire and is carrying out a peace movement, you can temporarily calm your anger. I also hope that you will think calmly, open your eyes and look at the facts, and do not needlessly go to your death in vain!</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 1st) In order to reorganize higher education in Shanxi, the Ministry of Education has ordered the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education to merge duplicate departments. Starting from the next academic year, the Provincial College of Education and the Provincial College of Law should be merged into Shanxi University. The three departments of the College of Education will be merged into the College of Arts of Shanxi University, and the two departments of the College of Law will be merged into the College of Law of Shanxi University. The funds of the two colleges will be allocated to Shanxi University, totaling more than 430,000 yuan annually. With more ample funds, various facilities can be easily established. Books and instruments will be uniformly merged, making it easier to achieve complete equipment. Faculty and staff will be reassigned duties, ensuring that everyone is qualified and competent. Then, the administrative organization will be simplified to the greatest extent, and the savings will be used to enrich the content. By concentrating all efforts on this, it will be easier to achieve perfection. As for the science and medical departments, Shanxi University will gradually plan to add them according to its economic situation.</p>

<p>Health Education Exhibition Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>- More than 10,000 exhibits on display in two venues, a feast for the eyes</p>
<p>- Mayor Wu speaks of the need for Chinese people to overcome the mentality of relying on heaven for sustenance</p>
<p>- Children's dental health competition to be held during the exhibition</p>
<p>The first Health Education Exhibition, co-sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Education and Health Bureaus, opened yesterday at the Puyi Society and Cangji Primary School venues. The opening ceremony was held at the Puyi Society at 10:00 am. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: In addition to Chairman Wu Tiecheng, Vice-Chairmen Pan Gongzhan and Li Tingan, and all members of the Health Education Committee, representatives from various organizations included Cao Peizi from the Municipal Party Department, Li Dachao from the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center, Liu Yide from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhu Jiqing from the National Health Administration, Wu Liande from the Maritime Quarantine Service, Xu Yiheng from the Garrison Command, Xiao Qixiong from the Public Security Bureau, Pan Hongding from the Municipal Council, Zhu Shaoping from the World Student Service, Lu Bokui from the Library Association, Sun Choucheng from the New Drug Association, and more than 500 teachers and students from various schools.</p>
<p>Venue Situation: Along the Zhonghua Road area from Xiaonanmen to Dadongmen, there were large white cloth banners across the street. Above the entrance of the venue hung a bright banner that read "To strengthen the country, one must first strengthen the body; physical education and hygiene are the methods." In addition to the Public Security Bureau dispatching police to maintain order, Zhou Mingshi led the entire Boy Scout troop of Junyi Middle School to maintain order at the first venue. The Upper China Experimental Primary School Boy Scouts provided services at the second venue. A Red Cross Hospital ambulance was stationed at the venue for protection. Therefore, although attendance was very enthusiastic yesterday, the order was well maintained. The opening ceremony was held at the performance area of the first venue.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The ceremony was held at 10:00 am, presided over by Chairman Wu Tiecheng, recorded by Yu Wenwei, and emceed by Peng Quji. After the customary rites, Mayor Wu delivered an address, followed by reports from the two Bureau Chiefs, Pan and Li, on the preparations. Finally, guests such as Wu Liande, Director of the Maritime Quarantine Service, and Zhu Jiqing from the National Health Administration, gave speeches successively. The meeting adjourned for a photo session at around 11:00 am.</p>
<p>Mayor's Address: Mayor Wu's address briefly stated: "Gentlemen, today is the first Health Education Exhibition held in Shanghai. Most of those attending the ceremony are young students, which shows that Chinese youth are paying close attention to health education. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, 'We Chinese rely on heaven for sustenance.' This sentence sums up the major problem of China's weakness and decline over the past century. A Chinese proverb also says, 'If the King of Hell wants you dead by the third watch, you cannot escape it.' It entrusts the misfortunes, diseases, and sufferings of our lives, and even the rise and fall of the country, to fate, as if there is a master god controlling our entire lives. As a result, various undertakings in China have been affected by the mentality of relying on heaven for sustenance in the past eighty or ninety years. This time, the Japanese are oppressing China with military force and occupying our territory. Old Chinese ideas say that this is the country's destiny, entrusting the fate of the country to heaven, so that the inherent strength of people is not fully expressed, resulting in the decline of various undertakings in China. This is the most dangerous phenomenon, and it is also what those who are devoted to saving the country are very distressed about and want to find a way to overcome this idea. We believe that a person has the power to resist our environment and control our lives, but the most important thing is health. The strength of our bodies and the length of our lives are all man-made and not reliant on heaven. One should first seek one's own health. The key to the success of great entrepreneurs, great politicians, and great thinkers throughout history, both Chinese and foreign, lies in their health surpassing ordinary people. Therefore, if we want the success of personal and public undertakings, we must first seek health. To seek one's own health, in addition to receiving sufficient health education and hygienic knowledge, we must also overcome the old idea of relying on heaven for sustenance. The fate of China, the fate of the Chinese nation, and the fate of each of us are all in our own hands and not reliant on heaven. You are all young students, and the future responsibility of China lies on your shoulders, so you should pay attention to your health now and prepare to shoulder the great responsibility of the country in the future."</p>
<p>Bureau Chiefs' Reports: Bureau Chief Pan of the Education Bureau reported briefly that the Health Education Exhibition held today is only one type of health education activity in this year. This event is organized by the Health Education Committee and is divided into two major parts: exhibition and performance. The exhibition is divided into school, society, and reference groups. The school exhibits are all from municipal and registered private primary and secondary schools. Twenty-four municipal schools were designated to participate, and more than 180 schools participated freely. There are nine middle schools. In the social group, in addition to schools, social organizations also participated. The reference group is for exhibits specifically for research. In total, there are more than 12,000 exhibits participating in this exhibition. Due to the excessive number of exhibits, a second venue has been added at Cangji Primary School. In terms of performance, there are various children's health activities, and the Health Bureau is responsible for various tasks such as bathing, vaccination, and dental check-ups for children. The significance of this exhibition is not just to complete the exhibition once, but to enable all those who attend to understand its significance and pay attention to personal and public hygiene, said Bureau Chief Pan. Bureau Chief Li of the Health Bureau reported briefly that the two words "health" are closely related to individuals and the country. The Health Education Exhibition is organized by the Education and Health Bureaus under the guidance of the Mayor. It was established on February 1 and is now beginning to exhibit after preparations. Its significance is very important. I hope that after the citizens of this city visit, they will put the images they have gained into practice. This is indeed the first time it has been held in Shanghai. In addition to hoping that it will be held annually, we also hope that a large-scale national exhibition will be held in the future, he said.</p>
<p>Guests' Speeches: Zhu Jiqing, the representative of the Ministry of Interior's Health Department, said briefly that public health is progressing very quickly in countries around the world, but they are all proceeding by using laws or improving the environment. However, in practice, there are various difficulties. Laws cannot control personal hygiene, and the environment cannot be improved. Therefore, everyone is now thinking of starting from the aspect of education. Since the sixteenth year of the Republic, health undertakings and health movements have been publicized a lot in China, but health requires practice, not formality. In addition to the exhibition, this exhibition also has vaccination and other work, which is to seek knowledge on the one hand and practice on the other, he said. Finally, Wu Liande, Director of the Maritime Quarantine Service, gave a speech.</p>
<p>Dental Competition: In order to promote oral hygiene and make citizens pay attention to dental health, the association held an internal dental health competition. All children under the age of fourteen can participate. The regulations stipulate that the inspection time is from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm every day during the exhibition. After the dentist has completed the inspection, the top three with the healthiest teeth will be awarded prizes by the Family Industry Society. The first place winner will receive twenty-four kinds of prizes, the second place winner sixteen kinds, and the third place winner eight kinds. The bottom three with the worst teeth will receive free treatment. Those who participated in the competition yesterday were quite enthusiastic. The inspection dates are still today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>Eight Records Broken in the Preliminary Competition</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The 17th North China Games are scheduled to be held in Qingdao, Shandong for four days on July 12, 13, 14, and 15. Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi and other provinces have successively selected athletes. Athletes from various universities and middle schools in Beiping have always had a status. At the last North China Games, they won first place in the individual total and first place in the group total. The North China Games are approaching. The athletes from various groups and teams in Beiping who participated in the North China Games have been actively selected in recent days. On the morning of the 29th, the rain had just cleared, and the cool breeze was blowing. The selection of athletes from the city to participate in the 17th North China Track and Field was held at Huaiwen Middle School at 8:00 am. There were many athletes from all over the country who gathered, but it was a pity that many generals had not yet appeared, such as Zhang Lingjia, Wu Youan, Peng Yongxun, Zhang Xinmin, Guan Yushan in senior high school, Liu Yingfeng in middle school, and Deng Lihua and others in women's, who did not come to the venue, so the results were also slightly reduced. However, the sky was overcast and clearing, the scenery was clear, and the athletes were running on the sandy track, feeling refreshed. Therefore, although there were no special records, the overall situation was still remarkable. It is estimated that eight records were broken in the North China record, including the men's senior high hurdles, middle hurdles, men's middle-level 100-meter discus, long jump, triple jump, and women's high jump and long jump. According to Ma John, the chairman of the selection committee, the selection method is quite complicated. Regardless of the ranking, only observe whether the results are eligible. At the same time, consider the allocation of participation projects to determine the candidates. The results of each event are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>A Dispute Arises: Although the men's senior volleyball selections have been completed, there is still a dispute. The selection results at the time were that Wu Guanglian and Kang Yinfeng from China College were selected, while Lu Dulun, Jin Zuyin, Xia Chengmei, He Shengxuan, and Guan Jianxiang from Fu Jen Catholic University were selected. Students from China College believe that in friendly matches and official matches held between Fu Jen Catholic University and China College, Fu Jen Catholic University was defeated in all matches, while China College won every match. However, in this volleyball team selection, only two players from China College were selected, while Fu Jen Catholic University occupied five places, which is unfair. It concerns the strength of the Beijing volleyball team. Therefore, they requested the school to withdraw. After careful consideration, the school allowed the students' request and immediately sent a letter to the Beijing Municipal Social Bureau Sports Committee in the name of the China College volleyball team, declaring their withdrawal from this representative team. According to the China College volleyball team, this withdrawal is not due to personal misunderstandings or opinions. According to reason and logic, the selection should not contain any prejudice and should be based on skills. However, this selection is not the case. Whether it is the women's volleyball team or the intermediate men's team, they all contain significant prejudices, which not only affects the spirit of the team members, but also greatly affects the strength of the Beijing team. The team had no choice but to resolutely declare its withdrawal.</p>

<p>Sun Zhichong announced: Regarding the registration for the 1000-meter obstacle race performance in this All-Nations Games, I was entrusted by the Westerner Mr. Mackner to manage it on his behalf. Now there are already 28 Chinese registrants and 17 Western registrants. Some athletes from the Chinese team of the All-Nations Games also wish to participate. Because I did not meet the qualifications set by Mackner, I was rejected. Many of the athletes looked unhappy and left resentfully. I am a citizen of the great Republic of China and sincerely hope that all athletes will work hard to win back the championship and wash away the past humiliation. Now a few representatives want to join the performance because of the novelty of the obstacle race. However, if they are accidentally injured during the performance, which would prevent them from attending, it would have a significant impact on the future of our country's championship. I hope that all athletes will prioritize the championship and must not hold on to individual exhibitionism. Please note that my rejection of registrants is out of unavoidable difficulties. Only those who know me will understand.</p>

<p>The Meiya Silk Factory is the largest silk weaving factory in China, with more than 3,000 employees. It already has organizations for football, basketball, volleyball, and other teams. The factory has spared no effort in promoting sports. For the past half month, several managers have been watching football and feeling itchy to play. In order to encourage employees to develop healthy habits, a senior football team was specially organized, named the "Strong Foreign Team," to show humility and politeness. If they lose, they can also use this name to absolve themselves of responsibility. Its strength is as follows:</p>
<p>Captain: Gao Shiheng (Deputy Manager)</p>
<p>Secretary: Chen Weizhong (Director of the Training Institute)</p>
<p>Team Members: Cai Shengbai (General Manager), Tong Xinbo (Deputy Manager), Liu Zi (Deputy Manager), Gong Liangwei (Deputy Manager), Jiang Hongjiao (Secretary), He Chun (Director of the Inspection Institute), Xu Tao (Technician), Li Youxing (Technician), Zhang Chuzhong (Technician), Wang Shirong (Director of the Second Factory), Ma Boluan (Director of the Third Factory), Zhou Pinxiang (Director of the Fourth Factory), Jia Xuecheng (Director of the Fifth Factory), Yu Youfu (Director of the Seventh Factory), Song Baolin (Director of the Eighth Factory), Tong Daoyu (Director of the Ninth Factory), Wang Zuqiu (Director of the Tenth Factory), Xian Jialan (Director of the Pattern Making Factory), Ding Chong (Director of the Dyeing and Refining Factory), Jing Shun (Director of the Warp and Weft Factory), Huang Geting (Director of the Accounting Department).</p>
<p>In order to practice, the team played against the factory's A team at the seventh factory's football field yesterday afternoon. At the sound of the whistle, each showed their prowess. In front of the managers and directors who usually manage them, they showed their true colors. At this time, there was no distinction of rank. They didn't let each other give way. Most of the managers had graduated from school and hadn't played for decades. Once they reviewed the old lessons, they were still able to cope. However, they had completely forgotten the rules, which troubled the referee and newspaper correspondent, Mr. Jiang Hongjiao. He had been in the battlefield for a long time and was extraordinary. As a result of the battle, the Strong Foreign Team lost by a score of one to five. It is said that the team will be trained and will soon issue challenges to other senior teams.</p>

<p>Since the passage of the Improved Curriculum Plan on September 5, 1931, there has been significant progress in the teaching work in primary and secondary schools. Although the Central Committee ordered all schools not to adopt any method as the basic teaching method, in practice many schools had adopted the so-called forced group experimental teaching method. As a result, not only was the teacher's task reduced to an extremely low level, but also the individual work of each student was neglected. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Soviet Russian Communist Party requested the education committees of all Soviet republics to correct the errors produced by this method and reorganize the teaching work in schools according to the following principles:</p>
<p>(1) Primary and secondary schools should uniformly adopt the recitation method in the classroom. This recitation should be based on the subjects scheduled in the curriculum and the specified number of students. This teaching method can be used in both group and individual teaching.</p>
<p>(2) Teachers should train students to use textbooks in a systematic way. They should also encourage students to work independently in study rooms, laboratories, and discussion groups. They should lead students to visit factories, museums, farms, forests, and other places. When they are preparing to help students solve difficult problems, they should encourage them to work independently on solving problems, writing essays, building models, conducting experiments, and collecting materials. The Central Committee of the Communist Party also granted educational personnel the privilege of leading school work.</p>
<p>(3) Each student's individual work record can be used as a basis for academic performance. Teachers should conduct a detailed study of each student, and at the end of each semester, he must prepare a report card for each student in each specified subject. At the end of each academic year, all students must participate in the general examination.</p>
<p>(4) The Education Committee should prescribe various training work and appropriate methods for working in laboratories, farms, and factories suitable for students' ages in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(5) In the past, school administrators and teachers did not pay attention to the problem of disrupting school order, nor did they make efforts to promote organized training. But now the principals and teachers in schools should bear major responsibility for maintaining discipline in schools. For this purpose, they must cooperate with social organizations, students' parents, and the Communist Youth League pioneers. Students who insult teachers, violate school regulations, and destroy school property should be expelled and have no right to return to school for one to three years.</p>
<p>(6) The Education Committee should prescribe various systematic educational propaganda methods and publish them in various educational publications in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(7) Because the effectiveness of school work mostly depends on material equipment, such as instruments in laboratories, tools in industrial rooms, and other teaching aids, the Education Committee must prepare a budget for the equipment that primary and secondary schools should have within two months in order to proceed with the purchase.</p>
<p>4.  Teachers</p>
<p>(1) In the past few years, since the Central Committee of the Communist Party recognized the growing activities and increased responsibilities of teachers, attention has been paid to the task of teachers. The greatest task of Soviet Russian teachers should be to impart basic scientific knowledge to students and cultivate their respect for discipline and a socialist attitude towards reading and work. The Central Committee of the Communist Party requested that the Education Committees of all Soviet republics and other party and government organs, within their powers, should provide teachers with convenience so that they can fulfill the task of cultivating and educating Soviet youth. At present, the political status of teachers has been raised, their teaching skills are being improved in every possible way, and they have been granted the same rights as workers in factories in terms of purchasing food, clothing, salary payments, housing, daily needs, and entertainment.</p>
<p>(2) When the Education Committee newly appoints or transfers teachers, it should encourage experienced teachers to help inexperienced teachers. Any local agency must not force teachers to engage in other social work during the time they are teaching, attending continuing education, or participating in special school meetings, and they must absolutely not be used as messengers.</p>
<p>(3) The children of teachers should have the same rights as the children of workers when they enter higher education institutions.</p>
<p>(4) Starting in January 1933, the Soviet Russian National Publishing Department began compiling and publishing a selected collection of educational books for teachers to refer to at low prices.</p>
<p>(5) The Education Committee should plan the steps for its implementation in the shortest possible time for teacher training work (including correspondence courses and crash courses). This training work should pay special attention to working methods and cultivating the ability to use maps, instruments, charts, radios, and other teaching aids. As for measures to reward teachers with outstanding achievements, they are also being actively planned. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e141">Scolding and Praising <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>Writing is a weapon of literary criticism. If used properly, it can be an immortal achievement. If used improperly, it often invites criticism of the weapon itself. Usage is not the same as grammar. "Writing is born from nature, and a masterpiece is achieved by chance." Chinese writers have always looked down on grammar. The beauty lies in the word "chance."</p>
<p>Writing has a "literary mind," and a "skillful hand" must first be able to "understand the heart." Satire is not as good as praise, and denigration is not as good as commendation. Praising the dead is not as good as praising the living. These are the so-called "literary mind." However, praise has its own reasoning. For example, if you flatter someone on the wrong foot, you will end up working hard and not pleasing anyone. Han Fei wrote the "Saying Difficulty" chapter, and Mr. Guigu also had the art of vertical and horizontal strategy, which shows the importance and prudence of the ancients in praising others.</p>
<p>In ancient times, writers were best at praising. Since the change of dynasty, the "literary mind" has changed greatly, so modern writers have all taken scolding as their ability. Those who restore the old scold the declining world, those who pursue the new scold the accumulation of problems, the steady scold the excessive, and the radical scold the conservative. There is scolding in the writing, and no writing outside of scolding. However, praising is already difficult, and scolding is even more difficult. The reason why national affairs are difficult to discuss today is because everyone wants to scold.</p>
<p>The same scolding, scolding the near is not as good as scolding the far. The same scolding, scolding can contrast with praise. If you can "understand the heart," then you have a "skillful hand." For example, people near the center can scold the southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. People in the southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest can also exclude their own location and scold the distant places like the people in the center. This way of avoiding the real and attacking the empty allows the scolder to feel happy, and the scolded person cannot hear it, or has no way to do anything even if they hear it. Scolding and not scolding are exactly the same. Otherwise, scolding people to their faces will surely suffer an immediate loss. How could there be such a fool in the world? Also, some people who are endowed with the "right to scold" can scold A sometimes and scold B sometimes. But like Jiao Da in the Dream of the Red Chamber, he scolded everyone in the Ning and Rong families, but the pair of stone lions in front of the door were clean. This way of attacking the east and striking the west turns scolding into praise. Openly praising people, how could there be such a fool in the world? Then, is today's "literary mind" not better than the ancient "literary mind"?</p>
<h3 id="e142">Passing Seven <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Weiyin</p>
<p>Alone in the room, everything inside and outside is silent, but I don't want to sleep or read, but I have to do something, otherwise the silence that is approaching step by step will make it difficult to breathe. When I am almost unable to resolve this, I often helplessly think of "passing seven."</p>
<p>As soon as I get a deck of cards, my heart calms down, as if the head of a chased pheasant has found its hiding place. While turning the cards one by one, I hope, expect, care, and worry. Seeing that a black seven and a black nine have been turned out, how I yearn for a red eight to be turned out. When it really turns out, it feels as comfortable as drinking a sip of mellow wine. If it doesn't turn out, I quickly shift my hope to the next card. Hope continues like this, and it is also a little tense. And from this, it seems that being a human being is not entirely meaningless.</p>
<p>Until I finally see clearly that this time I will not be able to "pass seven," I shuffle the cards and start again. While shuffling the cards, I think annoyed: If only a black jack came! If only a diamond three came!</p>
<p>It is the beginning of a new situation.</p>
<p>This time it is very smooth, and almost everything I want comes. So I am pleased. So I am happy.</p>
<p>But suddenly, I think, repeatedly, how is it that I am going to "pass" this time! This time it will really "pass"! So panic takes the place of joy. Because after passing once, I will not have the perseverance to pass a second time. The more I see that I will pass, the more the area of panic expands.</p>
<p>I really "passed"! The silence that had temporarily left rushes back from all around without hesitation.</p>
<p>So I am again trapped in the middle of silence.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Before Dawn <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Tingzheng</p>
<p>Before Dawn:</p>
<p>Big city --</p>
<p>Black smoke, bursting straight from the chimneys! Whistles, toot-toot, Hysteria's wild howl!</p>
<p>Blue-clad ranks, diffuse, diffuse, diffuse the streets: surging, this angry tide, this human tide! Crude, angry, the threat of death, the lure of light! This whistle, like a signal, the black night falls! The white day arrives! People! Laughing madly!</p>
<p>On the other side of the city --</p>
<p>Red and green Neons are extinguished! Jazz, tango, cease, quiet. Young masters, young ladies, drunkenly, heavily, lie like corpses in the arms of men and women, accompanying the night god to the black country!</p>
<p>An aunt, lazily, drags the opium-scorched old master, saying: It's almost dawn, why don't you go to sleep!</p>
<p>Before Dawn:</p>
<p>Big Village --</p>
<p>The warm moonlight rolls away! The beautiful stars also hide one by one! Light mixed in the fog, people suffocate, can't breathe, the sky seems faint! But, before dawn there is always a section of fog, light will expand from the fog, forcing the fog so that there is not even a shadow! Look, that east, has revealed a line of red light! Ah! Really!</p>
<p>Old man, little grandson, big son, a large group! Hoes, plows, shovels, shouldered on tattered clothes; old, young, all laughing happily, toward the direction of the sunrise, bravely, calmly, walking! Running!</p>
<p>On the other side of the village --</p>
<p>An old, large house with a garden of flowers and trees, on a nanmu bed, a sick old man, sitting and panting. Beside him, a woman in her thirties, wearing black silk clothes, worried, sad!</p>
<p>"Niang of Shen'er! I!! I'm afraid I won't last long! But, I can't rest easy! The times have changed, the harvest is worse year after year, the tenants are more and more arrogant every day, and now they are even unwilling to pay the rent! Alas! In this world, the gentry is afraid of not being able to survive! You, mother and son..." The old man gasped heavily, unable to say the words that followed.</p>
<p>Before Dawn:</p>
<p>In the market town!!</p>
<p>Vegetable vendors, rickshaw pullers, the dregs of the city! Each, each, preparing, climbing out of bed!</p>
<p>Ah! Noisy, chaotic, rows of rickshaws, loads of vegetables, swarms of people!</p>
<p>In the dim light, they appear to be struggling!</p>
<p>On the other side of the market town!!</p>
<p>In a front building upstairs, a young man with disheveled hair and a torn suit, his face a mixture of anger and sorrow, sitting on a three-legged stool, facing the unfinished teapot,</p>
<p>"It's over. All the methods are over! The clothes are pawned! The things are sold! There's no place to borrow money, and I can't find a job! What generations of scholars, what status; bookishness, status doesn't give us food to eat! Go! Go! We go down! Down to……</p>
<h3 id="e144">Random Musings from Qu Lu <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(39) The Origin of Couplets</p>
<p>Those who discuss楹聯 (Ying Lian, pillar couplets) have always believed that they originated with the peach wood charms that Meng Chang of the Later Shu kingdom inscribed himself:</p>
<p>"New Year welcomes abundant blessings,</p>
<p>Auspicious festival marks everlasting spring."</p>
<p>When I read Li Yishan's collected works, in the first half of his poem "Returning to Prefect Pei Mingfu's Residence," where he says, "That person chose a secluded and deep place to build, the cinnamon alleys and cedar paths are impossible to find. On the pillars are carved couplets, in the troughs the horses tilt their heads to listen to the zither," I strongly suspected that the phrase "pillars with carved characters" refers to楹聯 (Ying Lian, pillar couplets), not insect borings or traces. Later, I read the "Biography of Lu Yun" in the Book of Jin, which records that Yun met with Xun Yin and sat with Zhang Hua. Hua said, "Today we meet, let's not engage in commonplace talk." Yun then raised his hand and said,</p>
<p>"Lu Shilong of the Lu family from the clouds."</p>
<p>Yin replied,</p>
<p>"Xun Minghe of the Xun family under the sun."</p>
<p>Minghe was Yin's courtesy name. I also read the "Biography of Xi Zuochi," which records that the Buddhist monk Shi Dao'an of the Sangha order was intelligent, eloquent, and highly talented. When he arrived in Jingzhou from the north and first met Zuochi, Dao'an said,</p>
<p>"Shi Dao'an who fills the sky."</p>
<p>Zuochi said,</p>
<p>"Xi Zuochi of the four seas."</p>
<p>People at the time considered it a famous pairing. It can be seen that during the Jin Dynasty, refined discussions and spoken language also valued parallelism and elegance. However, this can be called spoken couplets, which are not the same as the pillar couplets that later generations refer to. Spoken couplets are used to display eloquence, while pillar couplets emphasize decoration. The former came before the latter, and there is a clear trace of transition to be found. Our country's characters are monosyllabic and isolated. They have tones that can be modulated to create euphony, and they have radicals that reveal their shapes. Odd and even numbers are generated in tandem, capturing the wonders of nature; low and high tones alternate, vying for the marvels of the sounds of nature. The Book of Documents has the saying, "Arrogance invites loss, while humility receives benefit," and poetry has the line, "Seeing much misfortune, one receives no small amount of insult." When human culture first emerged, language was also occasionally parallel. As artistic expression gradually developed, rhetoric became increasingly beautiful. This is why, between the Han and Wei dynasties, writing tended to strive for the path of 整膽 (zheng dan, a style characterized by parallelism and balanced structure). If we want to investigate the origin of couplets, we must know that first, there was writing that admired parallelism; second, spoken language also valued parallelism; and then, there were parallel pillar couplets, used as decorative tools.</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>Yesterday's "Random Musings from Qu Lu" (38) was mistakenly labeled (37). Also, in the line "Returning ten years to make a prisoner," "ten years" was mistakenly printed as "ten years." This is hereby corrected.</p>

<p>Selected Correspondence between Carrot Top and His Father (Continued)</p>
<p>Carrot Top to Mr. Lepic:</p>
<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>I have delivered your wild rabbit to our history and geography teacher, Mr. Legris. I think this gift certainly made him very happy. He repeatedly asked me to thank you on his behalf. When I entered, carrying a wet umbrella, he personally took it from my hand and placed it by the door. Then we chatted casually. He told me that if I worked hard, I could get first place in history and geography at the end of the year. But you can imagine that while we were talking, I was standing the whole time, and Mr. Legris didn't even offer me a seat? But other than that, he was very kind.</p>
<p>Is this negligence or arrogance?</p>
<p>I can't come to a conclusion, dear Father, and I'd really like to hear your opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic's reply:</p>
<p>Dear Carrot Top,</p>
<p>You're never satisfied. Mr. Gide asked you to sit down, and you were dissatisfied. Mr. Legris let you stand, and you're still dissatisfied. Perhaps you're not old enough to demand that others show you respect. Mr. Legris may not have offered you a seat, but you can forgive him; it must be because you're so small that he mistakenly thought you were sitting down.</p>
<p>Carrot Top to Mr. Lepic:</p>
<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>I hear you're going to Paris. I want to share in all the joy you experience traveling in the capital. This is a place I really want to admire and would be happiest to go with you. I know that schoolwork won't allow me to go with you, but I'm taking this opportunity to ask you for something: I don't know if you could buy me a book or two. I've already read all the books I have now thoroughly. Please choose a book or two as you see fit. Actually, any book will do. But what I want most is Voltaire's "Henriade" and Rousseau's "Nouvelle Héloïse." If you bring me these two books (books in Paris are extremely cheap), I can swear to you that the supervisor will definitely not confiscate them.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic's reply:</p>
<p>Dear Carrot Top,</p>
<p>Those writers you mentioned are just like you and me. What they wrote, you can do too. You can write a few books yourself, and then read them yourself.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic to Carrot Top:</p>
<p>Dear Carrot Top,</p>
<p>The letter I received from you this morning astonished me greatly. I read it several times, but I still don't understand it. This is not your usual writing style, and in that letter, you said some strange things that, as I see it, neither you nor I can understand.</p>
<p>Usually, you always tell us your trivial matters, you tell us your grades in school, the advantages or disadvantages you've discovered in each teacher, the names of your new classmates, the condition of all your clothes, how well you sleep and eat, etc.</p>
<p>These are the things I care about. But today, I'm completely baffled. Please tell me, since we're in the middle of winter now, why are you talking about a spring outing? What does this mean? Do you need a scarf? Your letter doesn't have a date written on it, and it doesn't even say whether you're writing to me or to a dog. Even your handwriting seems to have changed, and the line breaks and the number of capital letters are all incomprehensible to me. In short, you seem to be mocking someone. I guess you're mocking yourself, not someone else. I don't want to give you a demerit now, but I'm giving you a warning.</p>
<p>Carrot Top's reply:</p>
<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>I'm very busy now, and I can only give you one sentence to explain the letter I sent you last time. Didn't you realize that the letter was written in "rhyme"?</p>

<p>Increase of Eight Dollars and Ninety Cents</p>
<p>Strong Demand from Dealers</p>
<p>After declining the day before, the gold market suddenly rebounded yesterday. The process was quite stable, and market sentiment was good. Although silver prices rose in the British and American markets, the forward silver price on the London Metal Exchange, despite rising, closed significantly lower than the opening price. In addition, stocks began to decline, leading to a reactionary sentiment among dealers. Prices rose immediately after opening. Subsequently, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced a flat exchange rate, but the U.S. rate suddenly contracted by 0.125. Both the foreign exchange and gold markets showed positive signs. The market then entered a period of consolidation. The price of refined gold was calculated at an additional 60 yuan. The spread for six-to-seven-month swaps ranged from 12.5 yuan to 13 yuan. The market situation was stable throughout the day, with no significant changes. There was strong demand from dealers. A detailed account of the market situation throughout the day is provided below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 937 yuan, an increase of 2.8 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 7.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market initially opened with a flat British rate and a tight U.S. rate. The recent selling prices were a British exchange rate of 1 shilling 3 pence and 0.0625, and a U.S. exchange rate of 25.1875 yuan. Dalian banks Shunli, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, and Fuchang all entered the market, driving the price up from 6.2 yuan to 9.1 yuan. Huabi bought September U.S. dollars at 9.375 yuan. Yewanxing and Yuanxingyong sold, continuing the downward trend. With 9.375 yuan proving difficult to sell, the price fell back to 6.1 yuan. Yifengyong, Chunyongyong, and Zhifengyong all took advantage of the low price to enter the market. Shanghai bought June U.S. dollars at 25 yuan, and Korea bought September at 8.75 yuan, pushing the price up to over 40 yuan. Fuchang sold off several times, causing the price to struggle. Unexpectedly, HSBC announced a flat British rate but a slight decrease of 0.125 in the U.S. rate, boosting market sentiment. MacKay pulled September U.S. dollars at 8.75 yuan. Fuyu, Yuankangxiang, Richang, Xintai, Yuanchun, and Yuanshengyong entered the market together. Korea further pulled September U.S. dollars at 8.125 yuan, driving the price up to 4.3 yuan. Zhifengyong, Fuchang, and Daxingyong sold off. Citibank offered July U.S. dollars at 3.75 yuan, pushing the price down to 1 yuan. At this point, the foreign exchange market was slightly restricted by banks, making it difficult to rise higher. After a long period of hovering, market sentiment stabilized. Zhaofengchang advanced to 3 yuan, while Chunyongyong and Yuanchun further advanced to 4.4 yuan. Shanghai offered September U.S. dollars at 8.125 yuan. Goods were sold off aggressively, and Hongli also exited, falling more than 2 yuan. Soon, September U.S. dollars at 8.125 yuan were reported to be difficult to close. Zhaofengchang, Daxingyong, Fuchang, Wanxing, and Hengxing bought forcefully, pushing the price up to 5.8 yuan. Hongmeng began to restrict sales of July U.S. dollars at 3.75 yuan. Hengyu sold off, and goods were aggressively pressed down, falling back to 2 yuan. Later, Yuanxiang, Yuanmao, and Bingxing entered the market. Zhengchang and Fuchang sold off, causing the price to fall from 4.8 yuan to an afternoon closing price of 943.6 yuan. Goods were quoted at 4.5 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the market opened at 943.6 yuan, with goods opening at 3.8 yuan. Fuchang bought, driving the price up from 3.3 yuan to 5.5 yuan. Hengyu sold off continuously. Anda Pangen both restricted August U.S. dollars at 5.625 yuan, resulting in a downward trend. Daxingyong sold down to 1.7 yuan. Zhengchang and Fuchang entered the market, while Huabi bought a small amount of September U.S. dollars at 8.125 yuan, pushing the price up to 3.1 yuan. However, HSBC offered June at 1.875 yuan, and Fuyu and Chunyongyong sold off together, causing the price to fall to 0.05 yuan. The situation was quiet. Mitsui bought September U.S. dollars at 8.75 yuan, remaining stable. A telegram from Bombay reported a decline of one anna. Qingfayong, Yongfeng, Yuanmao, Fuyu, and Cuitai continuously bought in. Banks traded September U.S. dollars at 8.125 yuan, pushing the price up to 5.3 yuan. Daxingyong entered the market to sell off. Huabi offered August U.S. dollars at 5.62 yuan, but failed to break out of consolidation. Zhengjin sold July U.S. dollars at 4.375 yuan to Huabi. Hengyu came to sell, causing the price to fall back to 1.8 yuan. Yifengyong and Richang poured in to buy, resulting in a closing price of 943.1 yuan. Goods were slightly lower, quoted at 2.5 yuan. The highest price of the day was 945.8 yuan, and the lowest was 936.1 yuan, with a fluctuation of 9.7 yuan. As a result, the price rose 8.9 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price was affected by HSBC's U.S. dollar listing price contracting by 0.125, calculated at 24.5 yuan, which corresponded to a gold price of over 979 yuan. Based on the closing price, the deduction was approximately 36 yuan, slightly less than the previous closing deduction of 4 yuan. June registration was 957 yuan, and July was 944 yuan. The morning margin call was 957 yuan, and the afternoon was 956 yuan. The price of refined gold was calculated at an additional 60 yuan. The spread for six-to-seven-month swaps was: Qian Changxiang sold 42 lots to Yicheng at 12.5 yuan. Cuitai sold 28 lots at 12.7 yuan. In the afternoon, Renfayong sold 42 lots to Yuanchun, and Zhifengyong sold 28 lots to Yuanchun. Runchangyu sold 14 lots to Yuanmaoyong, all at 12.5 yuan. Huixiang sold 70 lots to Renfayong at 13 yuan. There were 5,138 lots remaining for June.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was quite chaotic. Overall, Ruixing, Daxingyong, Fuchang, Zhengchang, Yuanxingyong, Hengyu, and Hongli were on the selling side. Zhaofengchang, Yuanmao, Bingxing, Yuanheng, Dafayong, Xintai, Richang, Chunyongyong, Yifengyong, Yuanshengyong, Zhifengyong, Yuanchun, and Fuyu were on the buying side. Fuchang and Zhengchang suddenly entered the market to buy in the afternoon. Dalian bank Shunli and Wanxing had little trading, with a slight short squeeze. Guangdong bank Hengxing also lacked transactions. Goods quotations were under pressure, and the market was uncertain. There were a total of 24,045 lots of chips for July.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Foreign Exchange: British Rate Flat, U.S. Rate Contracts <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Most Transactions Were Swaps</p>
<p>According to London telegraphs yesterday, both near-term and deferred rates rose by 0.125. The New York silver price increased by 0.0625. The British rate against the U.S. rate rose by 0.0875, and the U.S. rate against the British rate also increased by 0.125. Although the closing price of deferred silver rose by more than 0.07, it had fallen significantly from the opening price. In addition, stock prices fell by more than 1 yuan, boosting market sentiment. The initial near-term selling prices in the foreign exchange market were a British rate of 1 shilling 3 pence 0.125, and a U.S. rate of 25.25 yuan. These were later changed to 0.0625 and 0.1875, with the British rate flat and the U.S. rate tight by 0.125 compared to the previous close. After the opening, HSBC's listing of the British rate as flat and the U.S. rate contracting by 0.125 led to a tighter trend. The process was slightly tortuous. By the afternoon close, the British rate was flat and the U.S. rate tight by 0.125 compared to the morning opening. The market situation consolidated, and the process was chaotic. Banks traded extensively with each other, with swaps accounting for the majority. A telegram from Bombay reported a decline of 1.2 annas. The domestic market only saw a fluctuation of 0.0625. At the close, the near-term selling prices were a British rate of 1 shilling 3 pence 0.0625, and a U.S. rate of 25.125 yuan, with the British rate flat and the U.S. rate tight by 0.1875 compared to the previous close. In the banking sector, Korea and Mitsui were on the buying side, while Zhengjin and Anda were on the selling side. HSBC and Huabi bought and sold to a considerable extent, with swaps being prevalent. Gold companies sold more than they bought. Western company Hongmeng slightly sold off. A record of the day's transactions is provided below.</p>
<p>In the morning, the near-term selling price for the British rate was 1 shilling 3 pence 0.0625. Huabi sold to Sassoon August at 0.25, and Sassoon sold to the Central Bank July at 0.125.

<h3 id="e149">Call Money Opened at Four Percent Again <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver and money market situation was such that, with the end of the month approaching and the beginning of this month, there was not much major trading as usual. However, the demand in the market was not as strong as in previous days, so the situation was quite sluggish. The call money market rate opened at 4 percent in both the morning and afternoon markets, which seemed slightly stronger than the overnight borrowing rate of the previous day. The addition of water to drafts remained directly high, at 0.323 yuan yesterday. This was because draft deposits were unusually scarce, and the banks on the Bund had large-scale receipts of funds every day, resulting in the concentration of cash chips in the vaults of foreign banks. The discount bill trading volume was 4.34 million in the morning market for transfers and 560,000 for new transactions. The afternoon market saw trading of over 300,000, with over 700,000 traded in the small general association. The foreign mortgage transaction volume was over 1.11 million. In bank receipts, foreign merchants received over 1.2 million in draft funds and 1.56 million in foreign currency. Various types of mortgage and special advance payments for goods were received, with 4.45 million in silver and over 2.55 million in foreign currency. 700,000 were deposited into warehouses. Chinese banks received 2.56 million in draft funds and 5.45 million in various types of exchange goods tax and miscellaneous payments, with 400,000 released from warehouses. Foreign currency public bills from money shops received over 32.2 million, with over 5.33 million for draft deposits. Over 60,000 was received in various regional exchange payments, with 200,000 to 300,000 in cash settlement. Banknote deposits and withdrawals were between 1.56 million. There was no information about sources from other regions, and outward transfers were clear, with 200,000 being shipped inland. The total number of items exchanged at the local clearing house yesterday (the 1st) was 32,075,009.34 yuan, including 29,100,5934.34 yuan in silver dollars and 2,969,075 yuan in exchange drafts.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Small Silver Dollars Declined, Copper Coins Increased <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, small silver dollars from Jiangnan opened at 851 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, down 1.5 yuan from the previous day, with limited trading.

Small silver dollars from Guangdong were 778 yuan in the morning market and 778.1 yuan in the afternoon market, down 2.5 yuan from the afternoon market of the previous day. The trading volume was 55,000 small silver dollars in the morning market and 40,000 in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000, to 317,000 copper coins.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Securities: Disaster Relief Bonds Auctioned Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Market Price is Roughly the Same as the Disarmament Bonds</p>
<p>The Process for Other Bonds Was Also Good</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange was still very good, with strong demand from the financial sector. As the peace conference had already been signed, although there were still indications of dissatisfaction from various parties, the central government had already made a formal declaration, so there were unlikely to be any drastic actions. In the morning opening, 20-year disaster relief bonds were added to the auction, listed after the salt tax treasury bills. The first market price was 57.1 yuan, and the closing price was 57.4 yuan. The July opening market price was 57.8 yuan, and the closing price was 57.9 yuan. Trading was flat, and the trend was very peaceful, roughly the same as the market price of the disarmament bonds, as their nature was also generally the same. The remaining bonds rose sharply by 0.5 yuan to 0.8 yuan due to strong demand from the financial sector. In the second session, the funds from the gold and auxiliary sectors were insufficient, and buying continued. Except for a slight decline of about 0.1 yuan in the forward 20 tax bonds, the remaining all continued to rise by about 0.1 yuan to 0.4 yuan. In the afternoon, there were slight rumors, and major investors immediately stopped buying, resulting in a slight decline of 0.1 yuan to 0.3 yuan. The closing news was still good, with most still rising by 0.1 yuan to 0.4 yuan. As a result, the bonds continued to rise by 0.3 yuan to 1.23 yuan. The outlook is smooth, and if there are no sudden changes, the market is unlikely to decline rapidly. The total trading volume was 12,415,000 yuan. There were no cash transactions, and futures were dominated by salt tax, accounting for 5,105,000, disarmament accounting for 1,655,000 yuan, the 19 customs duties accounting for 1,940,000, the 20 tax and 20 customs duties accounting for 2,780,000, and the rest ranging from several tens of thousands to 940,000.</p>

<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm stated that the New York stock market on Wednesday (the 31st) initially continued the momentum from Monday, continuing to rise, but many long positions were closed, causing prices to fall. American Combined Wireless, Electrical Appliances, and Pan American Securities were the most active. The total trading volume of all stocks for the day was 6,080,000 shares. According to a report from the Iron and Steel Century Magazine, steel capacity utilization increased to 41 percent this week. The volume of orders in May was the highest in two years. The continued progress in demand and production, and the gradual strengthening of prices, have rapidly established the industry in a solid position in the seller's market.

<p>The yarn market showed signs of fatigue, and the downward trend started again. After rising for two consecutive days, it triggered profit-taking, and the market suddenly loosened. However, actual demand was still good. Recently, the price of cloth has risen sharply, and sales have been brisk. Therefore, some people in the market are bullish, but sellers continue to sell off a lot, indicating a fierce competition between long and short positions.</p>
<p>Man-Made Cotton Futures Increased Short Positions</p>
<p>In the previous market opening for man-made cotton futures, the market sentiment was flat due to the small increase in the price of imported cotton. Short positions increased in the market, with each month falling by 1.12 yuan. The afternoon situation was still flat and weak, with each month falling by 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 51,600 bales. The sales were as follows: Hengda 1,250 bales, Yukang 1,450 bales, Suilong 2,150 bales, Renfeng 1,500 bales, Yichang 1,850 bales, Tongxing 1,000 bales, Chunjie 850 bales, Lichang 700 bales.

<p>The cotton market, which had risen for two consecutive days, showed signs of softening. However, the upward trend in Indian cotton was still strong, and the Shanghai cotton inventory was weak. The base goods in various production areas were becoming increasingly scarce. Therefore, long positions were still unwilling to release the amount they had absorbed, but some were selling and shorting due to the high prices.</p>
<p>Zheng Cotton Futures Fell Back Half a Yuan</p>
<p>In the previous market opening for Zheng cotton futures, the market situation was still good. In the second and third sessions, market sentiment softened, and the market suddenly loosened, with each month falling by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The afternoon situation was still soft.

<p>Silk Cocoon News Snippets</p>
<p>Jinhua Silk Harvest Only 20-30%  The new cocoons of the Jinhua prefecture were launched on the market earlier than those of Hangzhou and Shaoxing. This year, due to weather damage, the silk harvest only reached 20-30%. The cocoon market has been open for over ten days, but the recent arrival of goods is sparse, and preparations are being made to close the market. Cocoon prices are as high as 32-33 yuan and as low as 25-26 yuan.</p>
<p>Scarce New Cocoons from Liuxia Fetch High Prices  In the Liuxia area of Hangzhou, the cocoon production is not abundant this year. Many farmers are raising local breeds. The cocoon market has been open for more than a week. In the past two days, the arrival of goods has become even scarcer, and cocoon prices are high in spring. Each market has insufficient goods. Superior foreign breed cocoons are priced at 37-38 yuan.</p>
<p>Xindai Foreign Breed Cocoons are of the Highest Quality  In Huzhou's Xindai, silkworm rearing was not smooth this year, and both local and foreign breeds were raised. Cocoon production is not abundant. The foreign breed cocoons are of the highest quality. Cocoon merchants are vying to purchase them, and the cocoon price has risen from 34-35 yuan to 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Few Superior Cocoons in Yucheng, Prices Not High  Most farmers are raising local breeds, resulting in poor harvests and quality. After the cocoon market opened, the cocoons were of poor quality. Merchants from Huai and Wei were not interested, and the price opened at 24-25 to 27-28 yuan. Improved breed cocoons were priced at 32 yuan.</p>
<p>Few Cocoon Markets Open in Nanjing  New cocoons from the surrounding countryside have been launched on the market. This year, most silkworm farmers are raising foreign breeds, with guidance from students of the Jin Da Silkworm Department. Cocoon production is still good. Unfortunately, only two or three cocoon markets, such as Minfeng, have opened. Cocoon prices are as high as 34-35 yuan and as low as 25-26 yuan.</p>
<p>Henglin Cocoon Market Also Opened Yesterday  New cocoons from Dongshi, Wujin, have already been launched on the market. The Henglin Donghe Yong Cocoon Market also opened yesterday. The arrival of goods is still smooth, with selective purchasing. Foreign breed cocoons are priced at 33-34 yuan, and local breed cocoons at 25-26 yuan.</p>
<p>Five-End Man-Made Silk Solution Amount Reduced  The other day (end of May), the amount of term silk delivered by various foreign firms in this port on behalf of Chinese merchants for May was not strong, totaling only 580 boxes. Yesterday, sales to customers remained sluggish. Only 20 boxes of Changjiang gang's Ike Favre Flying Eagle and other brands of June term silk were purchased, priced from 177 yuan to 163 yuan and 25 cents net.</p>
<p>Yellow and White Factory Silk Sales Smooth, Prices Rise  Since the news of the United States abolishing the bimetallic standard was released, the price of Yokohama Japanese silk has gradually increased. Yesterday, the current period Japanese silk opened at 860 yen, up another 10 yen. European and American firms in Shanghai have all received remittances from overseas. Current silk sales are quite smooth. The stock of silk in the hands of various manufacturers is gradually dwindling, and their attitude is firm. Yesterday, it was estimated that British and French firms imported 330 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, 181 packages of Sichuan yellow factory silk, 210 packages of Lu yellow factory silk, 1 package of yellow floss silk, and 6 packages of yellow coarse silk. Factory silk prices have all risen by 10-20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Red and Green Tea Both Trend Downward <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of red tea from Qimen, Fuliang, Qiupu, and other areas declined because of tight foreign prices and no major progress in the market. Since the opening of the market, goods have been arriving continuously. The market has accumulated 17,000 to 18,000 boxes of red tea. Therefore, tea merchants are eager to sell and are willing to lower prices repeatedly. Yesterday, the lowest price had already dropped to 70 yuan, and the situation remained dire. As for the green tea market, prices were also weak. Yesterday, Yih Wo, Jinjiang, and other firms had considerable sales of various types of needle eyebrow tea. However, the most important Zhen Mei green tea from Tunxi was mostly stagnant, and the goods from She County had not yet opened. Goods from local firms in Wenzhou and other areas were unable to sell smoothly, and green tea fell by more than ten yuan. Therefore, most local tea factories have stopped production. In the Lake and Ningbo production areas, Mao tea has been ignored in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Grains Rice Prices Rise and Fall Unevenly <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten sources, and the sellers shouted urgently at the beginning of the opening. Su Tong japonica rice opened at 7 yuan and 20 cents. South Hong Kong gang, such as Li Xiahou rice, opened at 7 yuan and 30 cents to 27 cents. Secondly, Songyin and Lvxang goods opened at 7 yuan and 15 cents. Liantang thin rice opened at 6 yuan and 80 cents. Afterwards, the local street makers and guests adopted line drawings, and the market situation went straight up. Su Tong japonica rice rose to 7 yuan and 25 cents, Langxia and Hejingwan Hou rice rose to 7 yuan and 40 cents, and Liantang thin rice rose to 6 yuan and 90 cents. As a result, the market price of the Su Tong gang rose by about 10 cents, the South Hong Kong gang rose by 10 cents, 20 cents or 30 cents, and Liantang rose by about 20 cents. As for the Qingjiao gang's thin rice, most of them were packed to sell. Because the guest gang was willing to eat at 7 yuan and 20 cents, and the sellers said that the sources were not many, and all colors rose, the market price was already 7 yuan and 40 cents to 50 cents yesterday, but suddenly it was reduced, so they were unwilling to open the grain. The Tianjin guests turned to Songjiang thin rice and bought more than 1,000 bags at a price of 7 yuan and 38 cents to 22 cents. The Qingjiao gang held on until noon and only sold two loads of Chongte goods at a price of 7 yuan and 30 cents to 28 cents, which was about 20 cents lower than the previous market. This kind of uneven phenomenon was really unexpected. Yangjian had no honor or disgrace, Dujian rose slightly by a few cents, and Bianyuan was stable. Yinyuan had no market. (North Shanghai) There were 17 or 18 sources. The price of white japonica rice moved slightly, rising by 10 cents to 20 cents. The price of thin japonica rice also rose by nearly 10 cents. The price of Yangdu Bujian was 10 cents higher, and the price of early japonica rice was a few cents higher. The price of Baiyuan was stable.</p>
<p>Gao Xiang Xian Machine Rice All Rise</p>
<p>400 Bags of Saigon Transacted on the First</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of guest Xian rice turned strong because the Fuzhou gang continued to do business smoothly. The arrived Xiang rice was all odd and small, and most of them were of medium and secondary quality. There were very few high-quality goods. The Fuzhou people did not welcome the medium and secondary goods, so the medium and secondary goods were soft, and the high-quality goods rose by a few cents. The price of brown rice also followed by a few cents. Hunan machine oil was 8 yuan and 88 cents, machine Jing was 8 yuan and 8 cents, Jing was 7 yuan, and brown red was 7 yuan and 32 cents. The newly arrived 770 bags of Nanling brown rice from Anhui Province were also purchased by the Min gang, and there was a continued welcome intention. The initial price was 7 yuan and 78 cents, and then it rose by 2 cents. Jiangxi machine rice was 8 yuan and 40 cents, and machine early rice was 7 yuan and 68 cents. A total of about 3,000 bags, including 770 bags of Anhui brown rice, 1,005 bags of Jiangxi rice, and 1,131 bags of Hunan rice, were all purchased by the Fuzhou gang. The local street sold 400 bags of Saigon at a price of 8 yuan and 18 cents, sold by Anli.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Term Flour Stabilizes in Rotation <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market in each month was generally stable. Although the quotation of foreign wheat was about 10 cents to 20 cents lower, the market people thought that the decline in May was due to the nature of squeezing more, which led to a decline in the long-term. Yesterday, the factory's shipment was very rare. The things in North China were also temporarily stable. Although there was no large number of sales in the guest gang, there were still sporadic transactions. Therefore, the people's hearts became stable. Until the afternoon opening, the market in each month rotated and brought a stable image. Because the difference between the market price of this month and July and August was from 15 cents to 40 cents, the general hedging became active, so the transactions in each market turned active. As a result, this month was 10 cents better than the closing price of the previous month, July and August were 2.5 cents better, September was 5 cents better, October was 10 cents better, and November was the first time to open, with an opening price of 2 yuan, 40 cents and 40 cents, and then 5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Term Wheat is Watching the New Wheat Harvest <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the term wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month showed a slightly smart image. Although the quotation of foreign wheat was about 10 cents to 20 cents lower, most people thought that although the new wheat was about to see new, it was difficult to clarify how the harvest was. If the harvest was really good and the market value was very low, then the standard transaction could be smoothly transferred. At present, it is still speculation. The weather is sunny and rainy, and it is unpredictable. The selling households are tight, and the market is tight. As a result, this month did not open, July rose 10 cents, August rose 20 cents, September rose 30 cents, and October rose 20 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Oil Market White Tong Oil Rise Can Be Determined <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The rise of white tung oil is due to the activities of foreign firms, and domestic sales also help. Because it is after the festival, all places are preparing for summer sales. That is, the stock in this port is not thick, so the other day, all companies had to send telegrams to the Han market, but the Han market immediately rose. Last week, the Han line batch plate was still only 16 yuan and 80 cents. Since the Shen gang searched for it, the telegram yesterday said that it had reached 18 yuan and 60 cents. The strength of the rise can be imagined. However, the local companies in this port have collected their hands because they have seen that the market has been booming. It is heard that foreign firms have also sold to 23 yuan, and the Han line opened into Xiangtong is also 18 yuan and 50 cents. Perhaps the rise to this step has been determined. As for Zhejiang tung oil, it also affects the Han market. According to the Hang telegram yesterday, it has been made to 23 yuan, 20 cents and 40 cents, which is following the sound and is not a real sales market. Therefore, although the market in each place has risen, it is also a temporary trend. Whether it can last depends on the real sales in each place.</p>

<p>— Ying Zi</p>
<p>People in the mainland say that Shanghai is full of gold. Those who refute say that Shanghai's roads are paved with asphalt, or wooden blocks, or stone blocks. How can there be any gold? It's just a dream.</p>
<p>But this country bumpkin, who has been working as a three-story attic dweller in Shanghai for three years, feels that the ground is full of gold, and it is indeed not a dream.</p>
<p>Some Shanghai villagers inherited 20 or 30 acres of land from their fathers. Although younger brothers and typists divided the property, and sisters and nephews also came to nibble away at some of it, they still had five or six acres left, which they rented to people to build thirteen or fourteen-story buildings. Every ten or eight years, Shanghai became more and more prosperous, and land prices soared day by day, from 30,000 yuan per acre to 50,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan. Is that not a gold mine?</p>
<p>This is speaking of the landowners. Even the proletariat can find some gold on the land.</p>
<p>At every tram stop, or at the entrance of public places, you can often see some proletarian comrades, one hand carrying a blue-green, white-not-white cloth bag, and the other hand carrying large bamboo chopsticks, picking up cigarette butts everywhere. They can sell them to exchange for pancakes, fried dough sticks, sorghum wine, earth leather, and cage water.</p>
<p>Every month, at the end of the month, after a heavy and desolate sound of selling long ingots, the pavilion aunts and three-story attic aunts gathered at the back gate, burning their way. At this time, the proletariat wielded brooms and dustpans together, like a whirlwind sweeping away the remnants of the clouds, euphemistically called collecting tinfoil ash. It is said that tinfoil ash is more valuable than cigarette butts.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of person who specializes in turning over garbage cans. Those who are experienced in this way say that picking up cigarette butts and collecting tinfoil ash is not very meaningful. Turning over garbage cans is the most interesting. In the garbage can, chicken feathers, meat bones, and everyday meals are common. Copper coins and silver coins are not rare. If you are lucky, you can find gold silk rings and gold rings. Haha, you don't need to thank you, and you don't need to be surprised.</p>
<p>Shanghai is full of gold. The villagers do not deceive me. In Shanghai, there is indeed a way to make a living.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Dai Jitao's Filial Piety is Unwavering <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>President Dai Jitao recently built a villa in the scenic area of Tangshan. There is a Buddhist hall in the villa, and the walls are engraved with his mother's handwritten Classic of Filial Piety to commemorate her. Dai was orphaned early and raised by his mother. She drew bears and taught him, not inferior to the mothers of Liu Zhongying and Ouyang Xiu in the history books. Dai was also able to follow filial piety in everything and listen only to his mother's instructions. He once engraved a chapter saying: "Hate fine wine." He often used it on letters and notes, because his mother thought that wine could disrupt the mind and told him not to get close to distiller's yeast. His mother was thrifty and set an example, and Dai was also able to maintain his frugality. When he was in charge of the People's Rights Newspaper, he often went to small restaurants in Wantingfang to fill his stomach. Even after he became noble and prominent, he still did not forget the flavor of the salted pork and tofu soup in the small restaurant. He often went to enjoy it. Occasionally, when he entertained guests at his residence, the dishes were always prepared by himself, with four bowls and one basin. The bowls were chicken claws, duck feet, pig feet, and sheep hooves, and the basin contained only two salted eggs, which he called the four-foot-one-egg banquet. He liked to eat peanuts to help his writing. When writing the declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session, according to his attendants, he ate 480 peanuts. His populism was like this.</p>
<p>His mother's calligraphy was beautiful and she was good at poetry. She had a poem crying for Master Xiaoxuan: Alas, Master, you have gone to study literature. I wanted to follow you, but my son held me back. The eldest son has grown up, and the youngest has not yet grown up. Even if the mother teaches, how can it be like the father? Alas! Morning after morning, dawn after dusk, life and death are both sad. The loving mother is old and her heart is broken. The orphaned child cries and surrounds her knees. The sky is hazy and merciless, the sun is bleak and discolored. The clouds are floating in the sky, and the moon is hazy and hangs on the white wall. The cold frost is zero and the swords are sharp. All the trees are shaking and the Bashan Mountains are cracking. The crows rely on their nests and their souls are frightened. Only I caress the coffin and my heart is broken. The cuckoo cries blood and the smoke is hazy. The Shu soul mourns the leaves and the grass and trees are fishy. The legacy in the ears does not disappear, and the incense of the heart vows to comfort your spirit. Therefore, Dai benefited from his mother's teachings. He understood rhyme from an early age. There is a poem inscribed on the non-American War History: I have not heard of the hardship of serving in the army, but I wish to spill hot blood on the yellow earth. With one hand, open the slave cloud, and with both wrists, strike up the revolutionary drum. At that time, he was only twelve or thirteen years old. Dai was young and had an older brother who liked to talk about science. At that time, he did not think much of his younger brother's poems.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Cold Face <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Dingyu</p>
<p>The weather is divided into cold and heat. Of course, people's faces also have cold and heat differences. Strange! A good face really has warmth and heat. Friends who live in the fog at five o'clock probably don't know it. The committee members of the aesthetic society have decided to send Miss "Africa" to Hollywood.</p>
<p>Mysterious, anyone who has some experience in society will understand the difference between the cold and heat of people's faces.</p>
<p>Mr. X, who kneels on the footstool in the bedroom and cannot stand up without his wife's order, has a cold face in his office during the day, and he cannot find a trace of a smile. Even if he sees his friends, he can only hear a few sharp, cold laughs.</p>
<p>In the lecture hall, the teacher who holds the teaching whip and draws east and west is so majestic in front of the students. It is usually not easy to see his smile. Maybe you can see him and the female students whispering in the corner of the campus.</p>
<p>The office staff of the post office are really supreme positions. Look how majestic they are sitting in their positions! Especially the staff who do money orders, their cold and strange faces are often stiff. Although their hands are constantly working, the crowd of money orders outside the railing still feel that their methods are slow. When he finishes a batch of money orders, he calls out the names one by one. I think this is the time when he is proud.</p>
<p>In the cigarette exchange shop, they are not responsible for the copper and lead of the silver coins they exchange. If you take the silver coins exchanged from the original shop to exchange for copper coins, he will immediately slam the silver coins on the counter. After slamming them for a while, he will look at them carefully. If he doesn't tease people, he will exchange the copper coins for you. Some people will say "This is a new edition" or "Private edition". New editions and private editions are all exchanged by them. Regardless of this, if you look at his face, it is shockingly cold.</p>
<p>If your lover asks for something, but you are unable to cope, and you cannot get your lover's warmth, then her face must be cold, and very cold. In this coldness, there is a full of money. The remnants of love cannot be found at all.</p>
<p>The mediocre person who looks down on everything often prides himself on being superior, so he looks down on ordinary people. His face will have horizontal flesh. It's okay at first sight, but if you look closely, the shadows of the Ye Lang demon will wriggle in every pore of his face.</p>
<p>I have written several cold faces, probably quite cold. There are also prostitutes and pimps. Look at her face when she has no customers at midnight; and the fierce mistress's face towards the maid; the overbearing servant's face towards the apprentice... These faces are mostly below zero, which can be used as a summer remedy for you!</p>

<p>1. When you meet friends on the street, if you see them with angry faces or walking angrily, remember not to greet them, otherwise the other party will definitely respond with harsh words. Because at that time, they must have been angry with their family members at home, or quarreled with friends outside. Therefore, at that time, it is the time when they are angry and have nowhere to vent. Even if you meet them on the way, it is best not to greet them.</p>
<p>2. The masses on the road are usually very leisurely and relaxed; if you see people fleeing in a panic, or running wildly like angry horses, it must be a fire or trouble nearby.</p>
<p>3. When someone is chasing on the road, you can dodge to the side from a distance; otherwise, be careful of bullets hitting you in the face. Because most of the time, the police are chasing thieves, or the thugs are assassinating their enemies.</p>
<p>4. The corner is the easiest place to have an accident. Before you get there, you should use your hearing to listen for horns, shouts, or sirens from all directions, so as not to be in a dangerous place and unable to dodge.</p>

<p>Episode 8 Angry Words Inspire Youth to Resign and Escape, Enthusiastic Pity for Young Girl Embraces Cotton to Come</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the voices of the two people talking in the outer room were getting softer and softer. They simply couldn't hear a single word. This attitude clearly indicated that the two people were keeping their words from him. Although he couldn't interfere with others, he felt very uncomfortable in his heart. Guan Yaowu talked for a long time before loudly saying goodbye and leaving. Guizhi wondered for a long time, feeling that this conversation must have something to do with him. It was late that day and there was no time to make any claims. The next day, he got up early, opened the gate and stood on the street. Seeing that the gates of Gan's house were tightly closed and had not yet opened, he thought that Ji Zhi had not gone out. He put his hands on his chest and stood against the door wall, his eyes shining like two electric lights towards the gate of Gan's house. In less than half an hour, the door opened with a creak, and Gan Ji Zhi walked out with a smile on his face. As soon as he turned his head, he saw Guizhi. However, he pretended not to know and suddenly raised the collar of his coat to cover both sides of his face, intending to walk straight away. Guizhi immediately ran after him, raising his hand and waving several times in the air, saying: Second Master Gan, Second Master Gan, are you busy? Can we talk for a few words? Ji Zhi couldn't pretend to be confused anymore, so he had to stop, turn around, and nod to him, saying: Old girl, you got up really early. Guizhi said: These days, Second Master, you go out very early and come back very late. Are you trying to avoid me? Ji Zhi laughed and said: No, no! But I'm really busy with official business. Guizhi said: Official business can't be so busy that you go early and return late. Isn't there a fixed time for doing things in the yamen? Ji Zhi laughed: But recently things have been a little busy. Guizhi didn't pursue this issue, followed behind him, and walked straight forward with him. After walking all over the streets of Haiten, Guizhi suddenly stopped and said loudly: Don't go, Second Master, I have a few words to say. Ji Zhi smiled at him and said: You didn't say anything, but you look angry first. Guizhi said: To be honest, I've been angry for a long time, but I didn't dare to express it. I heard that Second Master is afraid of losing his official position, so he doesn't dare to meet me. Is this true? (87)</p>

<p>— Jun Ti</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, after Confucius was ennobled as Duke Yansheng, Zhang Daoling was also ennobled as National Teacher, which was comparable. In a certain year of Guangxu, Duke Yansheng went north and Zhang Tianshi went south. They met on the Grand Canal and competed to go first, neither yielding to the other, so they moored their boats. Other boats were not allowed to pass, stretching for hundreds of miles. The governor of the Grand Canal personally came to mediate, but they would not listen, so he reported it to the emperor. The emperor ordered the Ministry of Rites to discuss it. They replied: "The Kong family does not learn the Zhang family's methods, but the Zhang family must read the Kong family's books." Therefore, the emperor ordered Duke Yansheng to go first. This was probably because the court officials favored the teacher's sake and made a one-sided statement. In fact, the Zhang family also showed that they must read the Kong family's books. Now, Duke Yansheng has already been stripped of his title, and Zhang Tianshi has also been driven out. No one reads the Kong family's books, and the Zhang family's methods have nowhere to be used. Compared with the Panchen Lama, who is uniquely ennobled, what is his luck and misfortune like!</p>
<p>Zuo Zongtang was a famous minister of the Qing Dynasty, known for his military skills. However, his rewards and punishments often did not follow the law. When he led his troops out of a certain place, some soldiers entered a food shop, ate noodles, and left. The shop owner did not know. Another soldier entered, took his seat, and called for noodles repeatedly. The shop owner said that he had already eaten, and would not give him any, but the soldier did not admit it. While they were arguing, Zuo arrived and immediately ordered the soldier to be killed, and his abdomen to be cut open to see his intestines and stomach. There were no noodles. Then he turned to the shop owner and said: "You made a false accusation, you should be punished." He also killed him. This is truly unheard of military law.</p>
<p>Han people often say that Manchus have different surnames for fathers and sons, but this is not true. According to the records, Manchus and Mongols have no surnames, but use the name of their tribe as their clan name. In peacetime, they only call their names. Assuming the person's name is Cheng Zhi, and his courtesy name is Kang Ren, then they would call him Cheng Kang Ren. If the person is a county magistrate, then they would call him Magistrate Cheng. If his son's reputation or position exceeds him, then he would also be called by the first character of his son's name, the same as the above example. Otherwise, he would be called Cheng Mou, as if Cheng were his surname. This is the origin of different surnames for fathers and sons.</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, civil and military officials must hang a loyal and filial belt outside their robes. Its shape is roughly like an old-fashioned eyeglass case. Inside, there is a rope, a knife, and a packet of poison, which were used for赐死 or to give one's life for the country. Later, it only had a formal purpose, and it was like an ornament.</p>
<p>Emperor Dezong of Qing Dynasty, after experiencing hardships, had the ambition to restore clarity. He was the only wise monarch after Gaozong. Unfortunately, he had a mother like Wu Zetian and a slave like Wei Zhongxian, so he could not achieve great achievements and rival Gaozong. Is it not fate! I heard from my ancestors: "When I privately saw him when I went to court in my youth, his broad forehead and high appearance were really not mediocre. He ended up with his ambition unfulfilled, which is regrettable."</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty examinations, the county had a fixed number of quotas, so large counties often had lost talent, and small counties often filled the numbers. In small counties, there were even those who had not passed the sentence and were selected. So-and-so was also like this. I still remember the examiner's comments: "The characters are out of the ordinary, the articles are out of the question, and the poems are out of rhyme. Such a candidate is unexpected. If I do not take him, it will be an exception." It is conceivable that they must take him to meet the quota.</p>
<p>Peng Yualao was known in the court and the public for his integrity. In a certain year, he was sent to inspect the area. He passed through Zhenjiang and moored his boat on the river bank. Suddenly, a woman called out for help. After questioning her, she accused her adulterer of killing her husband. Previously, the woman had an affair with Bu Tou, who was favored by the county magistrate and was a tyrant. He wanted to kill her husband for a long-term plan. The woman refused, saying: "I am ashamed of having an affair with you, let alone harming him." Mou did not respond and left. After a few days, he came again and said to the woman: "Yesterday I met your husband and went to Jiao Mountain. Taking advantage of his unpreparedness, I pushed him into the river. Now I can live with you forever." The woman was terrified and said: "If so, I will accuse you." Mou smiled and said: "You can accuse me." The woman did accuse him in the county office, but it was not approved. She accused him in the prefecture, but it was not approved again. When she heard that Yualao had arrived, she presented her statement. Yualao liked to visit privately and had already learned the truth. He went to arrest Mou. At that time, the county magistrate already knew about it and was afraid that disaster would befall him. He discussed it with Mou. Mou said: "Present a sacrifice of skin and flesh, and firmly deny the truth. What can Tie Tou do to me." The county magistrate thought it was right. When he went there, he did not admit it. He was tortured, but he did not say a word, but called out for help. After repeating it several times, he still could not get a confession. Peng was angry and said: "I, the Ministry Court, will wrong you once today and kill you." The whole county cheered. Without this, it would not be enough to govern the violent and stubborn people. Peng returned and saw the emperor. Cixi said to him gently: "I heard that you killed the culprit without getting a confession. Can you guarantee that he is not wronged!" Peng replied: "Even if he is wronged, he can only blame his fate." He was especially upright for a time.</p>
<p>In the autocratic era, senior officials often suffered reprimands if they made mistakes. Most of the imperial decrees were issued by eunuchs. In the event of a reprimand, those who received the reprimand would bribe them heavily. Then, the eunuchs would only read "By imperial decree, reprimanded" and leave. Otherwise, they would hold the imperial decree and scold them arbitrarily, and also insult their parents. Although it was unbearable, they still had to listen respectfully. Thinking about it, it is laughable. The abuse of eunuchs can be seen here.</p>

<h3 id="e167">"Don't Discuss National Affairs" Defense <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Recently, the general group of friends wielding pens have suddenly become somewhat spirited. Everyone is unanimously shouting, "Don't discuss national affairs." It seems that in the past, they all thought national affairs could be discussed, but now they have come to a complete and profound realization that they cannot be. In reality, the world is so peaceful and the country is so enlightened that even if one wanted to discuss them, there would be nothing to discuss. It's not that it's impossible to discuss, but rather unnecessary. Frankly speaking, we have always been quite free.</p>
<p>Contrasting with "Don't discuss national affairs" is "Let's discuss romance," implying that only romance is worth discussing. Actually, this is also wrong. The words "romance" on the surface seem to have the leisurely and carefree connotations of "spring flowers, autumn moon" and "famous scholars' elegance." If one musters the spirit to sigh with admiration, it's indeed very romantic. Therefore, discussing romance must also have the "grand design" state of mind, and only then can it be done in such a way as to create wonderful works like "the ear hears and becomes sound, the eye sees and becomes color." And those with such a state of mind are only the likes of "mountain hermits," "lay Buddhists," "talented scholars," and "beautiful ladies." How dare we, the likes of us, presume to? If we insist on discussing it while enduring hunger and cold, then even if it doesn't come down to "one mosquito humming, two flies buzzing," we'll inevitably sigh and sing the line, "The old country is unbearable to look back upon in the bright moonlight." Inevitably, this is the sound of a fallen nation, which is again related to national affairs, and thus very dangerous.</p>
<p>I remember back in my middle school days, in the ancient past, it was as enlightened as it is now. However, students always loved to parade and give speeches, so the principal and the supervisors would teach us, "Don't discuss national affairs." At this time, a witty classmate posted a motto in the study, which was eight big characters: "Don't discuss national affairs, but read pornographic books." Of course, this was inevitably making trouble without reason, intentionally misinterpreting the truth of "Don't discuss national affairs." We are gentle and refined gentlemen, how could we do such a thing? However, "discussing romance" is slightly better than "reading pornographic books." Nevertheless, I always think it's neither necessary nor unnecessary.</p>
<p>So what should we do in these times? I think it's best to write a "biography" for Hitler, using an "immortal pen to record an immortal person." Secondly, regarding Mussolini's achievements, we can certainly write articles to promote them. And articles like "XX-ism and Love," why can't we write them? Only this is in accordance with the rules, only this is in accordance with the way of the gentleman.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Suicide and Prison in Japan <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Talent</p>
<p>The prevalence of suicide and the increase in prisons always indicate the seriousness of social ills. But what about Japan, which proclaims itself the master of maintaining peace in East Asia while denigrating China as an "unorganized country"? Recently, newspaper reports speak not only of the prevalence of suicide in Japan but also of prisons being overcrowded.</p>
<p>According to the Shen Bao of May 9th: "Suicides in San'en Mountain have suddenly become rampant. To date, the number of people who have jumped from the mountain to commit suicide has reached dozens. Yesterday, among the more than two thousand sightseers, there were actually six suicides... The venerable high priest of Zojo-ji Temple in Shiba will go to Oshima on the 28th to perform a grand Segaki ceremony to exorcise evil spirits."</p>
<p>Also, the Shen Bao of the 12th reports: "According to a survey by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, there has been an increase of more than four thousand criminals in the past year, a rare phenomenon in recent times, and the trend is still increasing... All forty-five prisons and branch prisons across the country have reported overcrowding... The increase in urban crime is even more ferocious. The four major prisons in Tokyo and the Fukuoka prison are already unable to accommodate new prisoners..."</p>
<p>Observing this, we can know that the surge in suicide and crime in Japan is fierce! If this situation continues, perhaps Japan will have man-made earthquakes in addition to natural earthquakes!</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese imperialism has been experiencing deepening economic panic, with small and medium-sized bourgeoisie going bankrupt one after another, and the number of unemployed laborers increasing daily. Unable to remedy the situation, they have had the wild idea of invading China as a means of saving themselves. Little do they know that the cost of launching a war of aggression against China is entirely borne by the hard-working masses. Thinking that it would save the country from economic panic, they have instead aggravated the chronic illness. The surge in suicide and crime is the inevitable result of the sharpening of economic panic.</p>
<h3 id="e169">All Kinds of Kisses <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Flustered Min</p>
<p>Mentioning the word "kiss," how sensual and nauseating! In Western countries, kissing publicly in broad daylight seems nothing rare. Chinese faces, however, are generally more tender than Western ones, and kissing has not yet reached the stage of public display. Therefore, the word "kiss" still carries some mysterious color. But there are all kinds of different ways of kissing, so let's talk about them.</p>
<p>Bridge Kiss</p>
<p>In dim sum restaurants, there are dishes called "shrimp crossing the bridge," "clear soup crossing the bridge," and so on. And in the realm of kissing, there is also a new term called "bridge kiss." What is called "crossing the bridge"? That is, when she is holding her younger brother or sister, and she and he have had some sort of emotional connection, he conveniently picks up her younger brother or sister, and gives them a big, special kiss. She thinks that this kiss has a lot of meaning in it. Therefore, after she has been kissed by him, she also kisses the child in a big way. Isn't this a "bridge kiss"?</p>
<p>Dry Kiss</p>
<p>Dry kisses are naturally not as sweet as wet kisses. For couples or lovers who are about to part ways or cannot meet each other despite being so close, they take out gifts such as photos, handkerchiefs, love letters, etc. In a clean and bright window, under the lonely lamp, when good dreams are hard to come by, tossing and turning, they cannot help but dry-kiss the treasured gifts with shyness and embarrassment. The so-called "quenching thirst by thinking of plums" and "satisfying hunger with painted cakes," the meaning of dry kisses is unexpectedly wonderful.</p>
<p>Flying Kiss</p>
<p>When eyes are flirting and two hearts are mirroring each other, sending wireless telegraphs to each other, they can only use their mouths to convey affection, flying the kiss over. If the other side returns the flying kiss, then it is a wonderful performance. What the Shanghainese call "picking up spirits" is this principle.</p>
<p>Stolen Kiss</p>
<p>Stolen kisses are the worst strategy, like cats stealing food and dogs grabbing things. If one kisses when they should not be kissing, or kisses when they do not want to kiss, and if they risk stealing a kiss, it is unlikely that they will be rewarded with a "Five Heads" beauty cigar. It is also unknown whether they will be greeted with "a thousand cuts and a rotten floating corpse." Alas. This kind of stolen kiss is both laughable and pitiful. The author is not a true devotee of kissing studies, but rather, based on what he has heard and seen in Shanghai society, there are indeed factual proofs, so he presents it to you for a bit of a joke.</p>

<h3 id="e171">The Old Villager's Heartbreaking Words <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zi</p>
<p>"The fence is broken, the wild dogs come in," these are words Mr. Buddha said last year in the "Talking Words" column of this publication. At that time, I casually glanced over them, and did not feel their pain. Now, seeing the fields and property of the Hua family being openly robbed and secretly taken, almost to the point of family ruin and death, I deeply believe that "when the family is not harmonious, outsiders will deceive." This is indeed the biggest reason for bringing about one's own financial ruin. Below are the heartbreaking words of an old villager from the Hua family:</p>
<p>"We," the Hua family, were originally a prominent clan, with a large population and many fields, worthy of being called a wealthy family. However, because of years of infighting among brothers, everyone only cared about selfishly competing for the inheritance. Often, it got to the point where family members did not recognize each other, and they killed each other. Although they said they were "compatriots," in reality, they treated each other like "enemies." Regarding external threats, it seemed that they were as unrelated as a horse and an ox running in different directions.</p>
<p>Our eastern neighbor, that local tyrant nicknamed "Dwarf Tiger," had long coveted the Hua family's many fertile fields and wanted to seize them for himself. However, the Hua family was, after all, a large clan with many brothers, and at first, he could not help but have some scruples. Ever since last year, in September, he openly occupied a large batch of fields and mountain farms in the northeastern corner belonging to the second brother. Seeing that our second young master was only busy dancing and gambling, watching as the property painstakingly built by our ancestors was robbed by the strong neighbor, he did not resist at all.</p>
<p>The eldest young master, on the other hand, was usually arrogant and condescending because the second young master was enjoying the legacy of his ancestors, and he did not put his eldest brother in his eyes. Now that he had lost so much property and fields, he could no longer be as spirited as before, and he could no longer "stand on equal footing" with his eldest brother. Therefore, he was happy to stand by and watch as the "Dwarf Tiger" occupied the second brother's fields.</p>
<p>As for the other brothers, because they each established their own households, they all held the view that "each person sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and does not care about the frost on others' roofs." Although everyone was a compatriot, and although there was a close relationship of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold," they were unwilling to "work together" to "resist foreign insults."</p>
<p>The Dwarf Tiger saw through this weakness of the Hua family brothers, who lacked mutual assistance and unity, and he recklessly and progressively invaded the fields of the third and fourth brothers. Moreover, he committed murder, arson, rape, and robbery. The women, old, and young of the Hua family all suffered inhumane ravages. Many fine houses and villages were turned into scorched earth. Everything was desolate, wives were separated from their children, and chickens and dogs were uneasy...</p>
<p>The old villager sighed with tears streaming down his wrinkled face, saying: "Alas, now the Dwarf Tiger is still continuing his efforts, constantly seizing our Hua family's fields and property, and killing our old, young, men, and women. If my master's brothers do not rouse themselves and quickly catch up, and work together to resist foreign insults, then we will be 'fish on the chopping block,' and 'I will be the meat.' Thinking of the days to come, it truly makes one shiver with cold, and how can the ancestral property painstakingly built by our ancestors endure such a daily destruction? The tragedy of family ruin and death is probably imminent..."</p>
<p>As he said this, he fainted, sobbing uncontrollably!</p>

<h3 id="e173">At the Time, I Didn't Know She Was a Married Woman <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am twenty-five years old this year and have not been married. I used to be a teacher at a school in Zhabei. Because the January 28th Incident in Shanghai occurred, the school was destroyed, so I am now working as a staff member in a company. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in Shanghai, I took refuge in a certain community center. There was a friend I had known for a while, Ms. Liang, who introduced me to a female friend named Li, who was older than me. When I met her, we were very understanding, and we developed from friendship to love, and from love to a desire to become lifelong companions. When she talked to me about marriage, I said that because my family property had been completely destroyed by the artillery fire, I had no ability to handle the marriage. She then discussed it with her mother and got her mother's consent, and then we lived together in western Shanghai. Later, due to my job, I moved to Hongkou. In January of this year, she gave birth to a daughter. Unexpectedly, last month, she suddenly told me that she was a married woman. Five years ago, she had married a husband who was doing business abroad in Hong Kong. But her husband has never returned since he left her. Her in-laws are also old-fashioned people and often quarreled over trivial matters, and she was subjected to abuse. Therefore, three years ago, she left her unhappy family and went to Guangzhou to make a living. Later, due to difficult living conditions, she moved to Shanghai, and therefore, she was introduced to me by my friend Ms. Liang. When I met her, I didn't know she was a married woman!</p>
<p>Sir, what can I do at this time? If I leave her now, it is pitiful that she is a lonely woman, and the child is still breastfeeding, it would be tantamount to putting them to death. How can my conscience bear to do it? If I don't leave her now, what should I do when her husband finds out? At that time, in law, what crimes should I be punished for?</p>
<p>Sir, what should I do now? Please guide me to a good solution!</p>
<p>Respectfully, Luo Ying</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The legal responsibility for this matter rests entirely on Ms. Li alone. Because her husband had been gone and had not returned, he violated the stipulation that "couples have the obligation to live together" and committed the crime of abandonment. In addition, she was abused by her in-laws, so she left the family. Then, when she left, she should have applied to the court for a declaration of divorce due to the absence of her husband. Later, after she met Mr. Luo and before she had a relationship with him, she should have told him the truth. Therefore, Ms. Li has the responsibility of deserting her husband and committing bigamy towards her former husband; towards Mr. Luo, she has even more responsibility for deception.</p>
<p>However, we must also say that the Chinese courts of today are still "grand government offices facing south, if you don't have money in your hand, don't come in." How could Ms. Li at that time have the power to apply? As for when she arrived in Shanghai, the environment was of course very difficult, and she was eager to find a man to be her pillar of support. How could she tell the truth and watch the food and clothing of a husband slip through her fingers? Therefore, from a legal point of view, despite having to bear great responsibility, we still cannot but forgive her and pity her.</p>
<p>Judging from the letter, Ms. Li is not an ungrateful person, otherwise, how could she have revealed the truth? Therefore, Mr. Luo seems to have no reason to break up with her now. When her husband finds out and comes to reason with her, as long as Ms. Li explains the situation, Mr. Luo can be completely free of blame. As for Ms. Li, there is no need to worry too much. In today's world, living one day is like two and a half days. When problems arise in the future, it is several times better than starving to death now. Moreover, anyone who hears of your situation will sympathize with you. Even if you end up in court, it is not difficult to seek the judge's pity and have a lenient sentence!</p>

<h3 id="e174">The Life of the Five Concubines (Continued 24) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Twenty-one. Women and Opium</p>
<p>After a bout of terror, Zhang Wenbin had no intention of sleeping anymore. Although He Xiang still carefully served him to sleep, his heart was still constantly jumping. He thought, what if Minister Su had unfortunately caught me just now? Then how would I explain it? Could I have a reason to say that I stole his concubine? He is the master of the fifth madam, and Miss Liu belongs to him. So, he could not help but angrily say:</p>
<p>"Damn it!"</p>
<p>But when he thought that Miss Liu loved him passionately, and in fact, he was her possessor, he immediately felt proud and gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>Suddenly, footsteps sounded near his door, so he immediately closed his eyelids. It must be the fifth madam. He listened quietly. The footsteps stopped at the door for a while, then walked closer to the bed, bringing a thick fragrance of powder mixed with the scent of flesh. Then a hand reached out to cover him with the quilt, touching his cheek. So, he could no longer bear it, forcefully holding her hand, passionately kissing it, still closing his eyes and saying dreamily:</p>
<p>"Oh! My darling, you finally came, I was waiting for your lips."</p>
<p>Following these words was a burst of giggling laughter from a woman. This laughter surprised him, so he immediately opened his eyes, and could not help but be stunned. Ah, it turned out to be He Xiang blushing and smiling charmingly at him. But her charming eyes excited him, and her silent affection made him receive another kind of virgin tenderness. At this moment, he immediately sat up, violently pulled her over, sat her on his lap, and took the opportunity to tightly suck on her lips. Of course, at this time, He Xiang could not help but struggle a little, but in the end, she still went with the flow and let him enjoy himself.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Wu Gui shouted loudly by the stairs:</p>
<p>"Young Master Zhang, is Young Master Zhang there?"</p>
<p>He Xiang quickly climbed off the bed, tidied her hair, and walked towards Wu Gui, softly saying: "He is sleeping. What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Not awake yet? The master is asking him to come over to talk."</p>
<p>Young Master Zhang heard clearly inside, but he had to pretend to have just woken up, and answered with a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Coming!"</p>
<p>Walking into the fifth madam's room, Minister Su was lying on the bed smoking. Because it was the time when he was most addicted to smoking, it was inconvenient to talk to him. He just glanced sideways and greeted him, then slowly pulled out the opium pipe and said:</p>
<p>"You are doing very well here, take good care of me, you know I trust you very much."</p>

<p>— Yifan</p>
<p>Hollywood Affected by the Economic Collapse</p>
<p>Major Stars Planning for Their Own Lives</p>
<p>"The warmth of human kindness, the coolness of worldly affairs," is an inevitable phenomenon in societies both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. Take Hollywood in the United States, for example. Ever since the tide of economic collapse invaded, everyone has been rumored that Hollywood has reached the setting sun. In addition, the banks were closed for a few days, leaving the stars with nowhere to go. They wore clothes made by famous tailors, but their pockets were empty. The women's diamond-encrusted purses, besides rouge and powder puffs, had nothing else. How could these pampered and brilliant creatures live through such days? It was truly suffering all the idle air of the world! Now, it is simply better. Actually, there is a famous Hollywood female reporter named Nina Wilcox Putnam who asked the major stars an abrupt and terrible question: "If you lose your job in Hollywood, how will you live?"</p>
<p>That day was a banquet at the home of a major director, and this female reporter was also on the guest list. After she raised this terrible question during the banquet, the first one she attacked was Lyon Barrymore. Unprepared, he was suddenly attacked by this question. He quickly put down the salmon roe that he was about to put in his mouth, and said with wide eyes, "I can go back to the stage." "What if there are no opportunities on the stage either?" The female reporter continued to attack. Lyon Barrymore said, "Then I'm afraid I'll have to make a living by drawing." It turns out that Lyon Barrymore is a multi-talented artist. Besides movies and the stage, he is also good at pen and ink drawings and has some small fame. But this question really touched his heart, and he began to think deeply about it. After a while, he continued, "If no one buys my pen and ink drawings, I can still engage in copperplate engraving. Isn't the government always lacking good engravers? I can go to the government printing bureau. Even if I can't earn money, can't I still engrave a few for the government?" Just imagine, the famous Lyon Barrymore at that time would have to wear a magnifying glass, holding a piece of copper in one hand and a knife in the other, wearing worker's clothes, and covered in the stench of copper and the smell of strong acid. It's truly unbearable to look back on.</p>
<p>After the female reporter got the answer, she turned the cannon and attacked Joan Crawford again. Joan Crawford is a woman of thought. No matter what the matter is, no matter what the words are, she always thinks three times before acting and three times before speaking. She was attacked by this question, neither surprised nor laughing wildly. She calmly considered it for a while, and then said very solemnly, "I have also thought about this question from time to time. We are unfortunately born in this chaotic world, and anything is possible. As for me personally, if I stumble in the film industry, the only thing I can do is teach dancing. After I drink a cup of coffee in the morning, I will go out to various dance schools to look for a job as a dance instructor. I like teaching children to dance the most. Whether it's opening a dance class, in a school, in a theater, or in a private home, I'm willing to do it. I want to make people understand the joy of dancing well. If my luck is even worse, I can dance on the street. At that time, I'm afraid the world-famous cellist Fritz Kreisler would also be willing to play the violin for me. My love could also hold a copper basin and ask the people standing around for money." That's truly incredible! (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e176">Review of "A Little Bitterness" <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Sound films are developing day by day, and silent films are disappearing. This great tide has caused John Gilbert's past glory to plummet. "Living Dead" was certainly a major failure, and the public opinion of "Lower Depths" was not very good either. Although "A Little Bitterness" shown by Cathay yesterday was better than the previous two films, it still did not escape the trap of failure.</p>
<p>Here, he plays a worker whose companion is deceived by a wanton woman (?). Therefore, he tries his best to sabotage it, causing his companion to resent him and secretly hurt him. But in the end, the companion repents and divorces, and they are still good friends.</p>
<p>What is this story about? Does it represent the spirit of friendship? Does it satirize the despicable nature of gold-digging women? But it has no core. Would a gold-digging woman be fascinated by a worker with a salary of seventy-five yuan? Since the companion has resented him for a long time, would he still be willing to visit him after being injured? Obviously, there are great regrets in the script. Moreover, at the end, the companion is clearly a rejected lover, and the woman is still a wanderer. Can the responsibility of the script be considered complete with such a vague ending? The contradiction in the companion's personality before and after also reveals the imperfection of the script.</p>
<p>Who doesn't know that John in the silent era was a screen lover? Who doesn't admire his gentleness and beauty? Now that he is middle-aged, he doesn't have the same demeanor as before, so he has to change his style. But asking him to play a lower-class worker is really not very suitable. In fact, his pronunciation has improved a lot. The reason why he didn't succeed three times is entirely because the personality of the character in the play does not allow him to develop. Although his expression here is not particularly brilliant, it is generally very good. The scene in the hospital at the end, followed by a bitter smile, is quite touching. Robert Armstrong, who plays his companion, is too fiery. For example, after John's sabotage, his resentment is completely exposed. How capable the other party is, he makes the other party look like a foolish idiot, which is called "hard work without reward." Mae Clarke, who plays the woman, is okay. She actually did everything she should in terms of expression, vividly portraying the identity of a proud and modern woman. The remaining supporting roles are generally acceptable, but each person's individual work is limited, so there is no need to mention them.</p>
<p>Too many dialogues are also one of the reasons why this film is tiring. Sound recording and photography, and lighting are all around the horizontal line. Only the falling from a high building and the reunion in the hospital show the agility of the camera and the skills of dividing the scenes. The exterior scenes are very grand, and some of the interior scenes are detached from reality, not like the furnishings that should befit the identity of the characters in the play.</p>
<p>The director has too few interesting interjections, and he doesn't know how to use the twists and turns that a film should have to attract the audience's attention. Therefore, except for a few particularly brilliant scenes (referring to the performance and plot changes), the whole film is noticeably monotonous and boring.</p>
<p>For John's personal performance, the more beautiful techniques, and the neatness of the supporting actors' skills, this film may still be worth watching?</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3 id="e177">On the Sentiments of Spring Water <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Ming</p>
<p>Recently, Chinese films are always calling for "changing their style," but after watching them, people can't help but be disappointed.</p>
<p>"Spring Water Sentiments" is the latest progressive work of the Star Film Company. It depicts all the activities under the feudal system, the ugliness of officialdom, blind love, the idea of getting promoted and making a fortune, and the darkness in patriarchal society. All of this is exposed in this film. However, the weak unity and struggle of the Northwest Reclamation Group will never break through the lives of the poor. Moreover, when it comes to overthrowing imperialism and feudal forces, this is a weakness of consciousness, which gives people a wrong idea.</p>
<p>Director's skills: I think it still lacks rigor. Before Tang Shusheng falls in love with Amao, a section of the initial change should be added. The scene of the lake tour, the scenery is beautiful, and the faint movements seen from the branches are very touching.</p>
<p>In terms of individual performances: Hu Die's expression of joy and sorrow is very considerate, but it is a pity that the expressions before and after "production" are too neglected. But from a general point of view, she is indeed very suitable to perform this character. Sun Min's performance here is very ineffective, while Yan Yuexian, Hu Ping, Wang Xianzai, and others are all competent.</p>
<p>In addition, the subtitles are more concise than before, but they still can't get rid of the Saturday School's writing style. Finally, I dare to say that this film is much better than the previous Free Flower and others. In Chinese films, it can be said to be not bad to have such achievements.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Thoughts After Watching "Spring Water Sentiments" <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Ying</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the times has rolled into the 20th century, and the sound of love - the entity and the general young men and women - is indeed surging day by day. At the same time, newspapers are also reporting news of abandonment. If we explore with the eyes of a sociologist, we will definitely be able to analyze the cruel elements in it.</p>
<p>The film "Spring Water Sentiments" clearly exposes the cruelty of abandoning someone after seducing them, and the sins of gilded love. The darkness of officialdom and the meaninglessness of love are also powerfully depicted here. At the same time, it makes a powerful cry for women oppressed by feudal evil forces, especially for men who abuse love and play with women, giving them a head-on blow.</p>
<p>The director's methods are mediocre, which makes the plot before and after too disjointed. However, in the two scenes of the lake tour and the contrast between the sweet and bitter situations, we should not obliterate it.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, the most successful is Hu Die. Her performance can make the audience feel deep sympathy everywhere. Yan Yuexian is also not bad, but Sun Min feels that she has regressed compared to her previous works. Hu Ping also has considerable success.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Thoughts After Watching "Spring Water Sentiments" <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Meilan</p>
<p>"Spring Water Sentiments," what a poetic title. On Sunday, there was nothing to do at school, so I went to Xin Guang with a few classmates to appreciate it.</p>
<p>The Star Film Company is now very concerned about women's affairs, so it has several films that discuss our women's issues. It clearly understands the environment we women are in now. It reveals everywhere how we women are being played with and how we feel sad in the current society. It exposes the ferocity of the bourgeoisie on the one hand, and the weaknesses of our women on the other. Of course, it is a good thing to use these as film themes to promote the awakening of women themselves.</p>
<p>Loving one and abandoning another is a common occurrence for the bourgeoisie. Naturally, they will not care about the sorrow and pain of those who are abandoned. I think in this society, women are bound to be played with and trampled on because they cannot be self-reliant and rely on men in everything. The phrase "equality between men and women" is simply deceiving. I feel that in such a bad environment, there is no other way for us women to go except to struggle. If we are not willing to live a miserable and pitiful life under the oppression of the capitalists, we must take out our perseverance and fight against the bad environment and bad society. I believe that if we can be unyielding and unyielding, victory will surely belong to us. Female compatriots, let's unite! (Chapter missing)</p>
<h3 id="e180">Thoughts After Watching "The Future" <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Yi</p>
<p>What is depicted in "The Future" is a common phenomenon in modern society. Conversely, it is also a mistake that young men easily make in a society of transition between the old and the new. In passionate love, reason often cannot control emotions, so people do all kinds of self-deceiving things involuntarily. These principles are very simple and easy to understand: but the behavior of young men and women in the period of infatuation is chaotic, and the mistakes they make are often knowingly committed. In "The Future," although I do not see a little bit of cause and effect, it leaves a signpost for the general women of the times - that is: after a woman marries a husband, she cannot completely immerse herself in the river of love and rely on her husband: she must continue to work hard for her own "future."</p>
<p>The so-called "modern women" who are busy all day with dressing up, eating big meals, watching movies, and dancing should also wake up after watching "The Future"!</p>
<h3 id="e181">Recent News from the Film Industry <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Jingzhi</p>
<p>Since its organization, the United Company has completed the production of "Rebirth," "Return My Rivers and Mountains," and "Lonely Sacrifice," all of which are excellent films. It is said that "Return My Rivers and Mountains" will soon meet with people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Yihua Company, founded independently by Tian Han, has now completed the filming of its first production, "Where to Go." Tian Han is responsible for both directing and writing the script. Let us wait and see what kind of images this president of the South China Drama Society will give us.</p>
<p>The long-awaited "Spring Tide" still has no news of public release. According to insiders, it is currently undergoing editing because Li Li's romantic performance was prohibited by the film censorship committee. Also, because Mr. Yan Heming is still not satisfied with the sound recording, it is being revised again. It is expected that the date of public release will not be far away.</p>
<p>The Lianhua Company's "Light of Motherhood" and "Little Gadgets" were completed filming yesterday. It is currently busy with sorting work and will be released soon.</p>
<p>The films that the Star Film Company is currently producing include "Modern Woman," a script written by Ms. Ai Xia and directed by Li Pingqian; "Sister's Life," a script written by Ms. Hu Ping and directed by Wang Xianzai. There are also other works such as "Oppression" and "Fishing Lights."</p>
<p>Shenzhou Company's work after "Spring Tide," "The Eve," is a work of revolutionary times and is scheduled to start shooting soon.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Records of Artists' Whereabouts <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Ren</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Bugao is currently directing both "Man Jiang Hong" and "Spring Silkworms," and is very busy. "Spring Silkworms" was originally a novel by the writer Mao Dun, a microcosm of the overall situation of Chinese rural areas in recent years, and a powerful work that caused a sensation in the literary world last year. The Star Film Company produced this film, specially opened a silkworm room, and hired experts to raise silkworms. Mr. Cheng Bugao's work is diligent and tireless, and his spirit of hard work is even better than when he directed "Raging Torrent."</p>
<p>Mr. Bu Wancang is currently directing "The Light of Motherhood," and the filming is about to be completed; as soon as the film is finished, he will direct "Childhood China" starring the child star Li Keng.</p>
<p>Since the release of Mr. Shen Xiling's "Cry of Women," there has been no news of his directing. It is said that Mr. Shen is currently planning to write a second script, tentatively titled "The Pig Herd."</p>
<p>Since the old man Zheng Zhengqiu put forward the "Three Anti-isms" - anti-imperialism, anti-capitalism, and anti-feudalism - he has actively implemented them in his works. His work after "Spring Water Sentiments" will soon bring the old man's famous stage play "Nobleman and Prisoner" to the screen.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Chusheng's long-planned new film "Fisherman's Song" is actively preparing to start shooting.</p>
<p>After the end of "The Future," Mr. Zhang Shichuan went to Nanchang to shoot an anti-Japanese and bandit-suppression sound film and returned to Shanghai a few days ago. His new work "The City of Prosperity" is about to start shooting, starring Ms. Xu Lai, the "Oriental Standard Beauty" who is on the screen for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="e183">An Overview of Soviet Russian Films (5) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Rudolf Metzl, Translated by Bao Han</p>
<p>In the space and time of waiting for further instructions, one can take a slight rest, whether it is one or two days, or up to a week, or after filming one film, one can continuously film other films, which are all insignificant issues, because since the beginning of his career in the film industry, he has obtained a lifelong career, but only asks that those who are engaged in the work do not change their minds and stop halfway. These employment conditions have been universally implemented throughout Soviet Russia, and are not limited to actors alone. All other people, such as carpenters, technicians, lighting engineers, and workers in the photography studio, can enjoy the same treatment.</p>
<p>As for the so-called movie stars, there are also movie stars in Soviet Russia, and the salary they receive is slightly comparable to that of movie stars in other countries. As for whether this special treatment of stars is in line with communist philosophy, the reader can decide for himself. However, what should be explained here is that Russian movie stars are mostly famous actors on the stage. They shoot movies during the day, are given excellent salaries, and return to various theaters at night to engage in stage life. To be promoted to a star with the qualifications of a movie lead is almost unheard of in Soviet Russia. Because the essence of Soviet Russian films is special, it is created for the application of ideas, not for the status of individuals. In addition, one thing is worth mentioning. Since the unemployment problem in Soviet Russia has been eliminated, it is impossible to temporarily hire a large number of people for a short period of time, and the film lacks crowd performance scenes. The production of modern Soviet Russian films also focuses on employing the smallest number of extras. However, when crowd performances are indispensable according to the plot, the only thing the director can do is to wait for the workers of the neighboring factories to rest, invite many people, and give each person twenty-five rubles as the price for seven hours of work. Although this method is generally convenient and feasible, it cannot be said that crowd scenes can be filmed arbitrarily in this way. Furthermore, although some workers are tempted by the twenty-five rubles and are willing to give up a day of rest, as far as the author knows, most workers would rather keep a day for recreation than get twenty-five rubles of idle money.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the crowds mentioned above refer to extras of more than two hundred people. As for the number of people needed in each scene being less than two hundred, all the staff of the photography studio can temporarily supplement it, such as typists, construction workers, etc., can all temporarily act as characters on the screen. However, if the number of extras required exceeds two hundred, the photography authorities have to find other ways to solicit them. (To be continued)</p>
