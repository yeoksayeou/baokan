<h3>時評　田賦整理問題英</h3>
<p>據日昨財長孔祥熙氏發表談話。擬於最近四全會議中。提出整理田賦一案。以期喚起各方之注意。蓋以各省田賦。向極複雜。有田少而賦重者。有田多而賦輕者。亦有有田而無賦者。自實行裁釐而後。各省因少一財源。乃有從田賦上着想。設立種種之名目。省方徴之。縣方徴之地方駐軍徴之。如所設（教育附加。）（保衛附加。）（團防附加。）（自治捐。）（村里捐）等等。税目繁多。且各自爲收支。漫無稽核。尤足蠧國病民。倘能加以整理。一可以剔除積弊。一可以救濟農民。用意固屬甚善。且際此社會陷於極度恐慌。政治瀕於凝凍不能發展之日。孔氏獨能鋭意興革。多所規劃。誠足稱許。雖然。竊以爲尚有可資討論者存焉。</p>
<p>夫吾國近年以來。農村破産。農民終年勞動。一無所獲。徒增賠累。故農民之苦痛。實有不能再任其延長之勢。一年而還。政府與金融業者通力合作。樹立種種計劃。次第設施。無非以繁榮農村爲目的。如復興農村委員會之設立。如四省農民銀行之創辦。如其他農業金融事業之擴充。補救之道。已極週密。然而事實上我國之農村。迄無繁榮之徴象。則可知目前農村經濟之衰敗。似尚有其他原因。而非徒恃農業金融之救濟所能爲功者。故以救濟農業金融爲目的而整理田賦。恐未必即能收鉅大之效益。蓋田賦整理計劃實現而後。大部分利益。恐仍屬諸少數收租階級。而於生産者方面。能否可稍蘇息。能否受到改善之影響。前途尚屬難言。此欲以整理田賦救濟農村者可商榷之一也。</p>
<p>其次。整理田賦之目的。將在於謀地方財政之救濟歟。則亦有疑問焉。現在各地當局。關於地方收支。每無一定標準。田賦之附加。有超過正供二三倍乃至七八倍者。其他尚有特殊收入。撙節用之。亦可勉爲相當之發展。故今日地方財政困難之最大原因。並非在於收入之不足。而實由於費用之繁耗。假使此田賦整理之施行而偶一不愼。則適足以便利官吏之誅求與豪紳之舞弄。此欲以整理田賦救濟地方財政者可商榷之二也。</p>
<p>抑整理田賦之目的將在於謀租税制度之調整歟。則誠大可討論之問題。我國田賦制度之不善。國人早已論及。加以整理。以求負擔之平均。剔除積弊。以收府庫之實利。就財政與税制兩方面言。洵均爲今日之要圖。然在今日地方多事支出極度澎脹之情形下。一切收入。均已指定用途。節約旣難。爬梳整理。尤爲不易。且當地方割據之日。中央改革税制之計劃。能否澈底施行。尚未易言。此欲以整理田賦。樹改革税制之先聲者。可商榷之三也。</p>
<p>由是以言。整理由賦。誠爲整理整個國家政治應有之一種計劃。惟當此百孔千瘡之日。而此問題又甚繁複。應如何考慮周密。興利除弊。尚有待於孔氏之宏謀也。</p>

<p>（巴黎）外長彭古與捷克外長貝勒斯會商各項問題、昨日下午業已完畢、所得結論、即意大利關於國聨會之見解、曁德國關於軍備平等之要求、當在國聨會範圍以内、并依照國聨會盟約所訂定之規則舉行一種會議以解决之、原因一方面小恊商各國以爲意大利之計劃、欲使各大國開始商議以修正凡爾賽條約關於領土各條欵、而此種修正、因爲小恊商各國所堅决反對者、另一方面凡在日内瓦以外訂立軍縮公約、各該國亦均所反對、則以德國之意、固在使軍縮問題不歸日内瓦解决、並欲於國聨會盟約所訂定之規則以外、從事於凡爾賽條約之修正故也云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）捷克外長貝勒斯·該國駐法大使奥蘇斯齊·與法外長彭古會晤、法國外交部政務司帮辦馬西格里亦在座、雙方談話由下午五時四十五分起、至七時十五分始止、貝勒斯出外時對記者宣稱、（國聨會問題及國聨會改組計畫、昨日已開始研究、本日予又與彭古繼續討論、至軍縮問題則已研究完畢、中歐巴爾幹問題亦已開始研究、明日大總統勒蒲侖請予午餐、所有與前項事件相關聨之各種問題、届時將再加以討論、予與彭古外長明日將以較多之消息報告君等）云云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>法國外交策新結晶</h3>
<p>對德不作單獨談判（巴黎）據工報載稱、法外長彭古現正與軍縮會議報告員捷克外長皮尼士在巴黎會談、其結果似可獲法國外交政策之新結晶、法國新政策大致如下、</p>
<p>（一）不對德單獨談話、（二）德國不得復置軍備、至少不得如目前所提議者、（三）軍縮會議不得在日内瓦以外舉行、但法國與小恊約國準備於明年一月二十一日在日内瓦與德國討論軍縮、（四）國聨盟約僅可以滿塲一致之表决修改之、</p>
<p>與同情國進謀團結該報又稱、法總理旭丹鑒於德國外交政策所造之恐慌空氣、已與陸長達拉第外長彭古及赫禮歐等作重要之討論、聞已决定會同與法同情之國對德採取甚堅决之態度、</p>
<p>法俄親善考慮進行尚一有事與此極有關者、蘇俄近請彭古往游莫斯科、意在成立法俄親善、此事曾考慮數月、迄未積極進行、蓋不欲造成德國被包圍之恐慌也、更有種原因、亦爲法俄暫未接近者、乃遠東時局尤其爲越南時局、蓋恐一日日俄開戰、法國之親俄態度或將發生不利於其遠東利益之影響也、</p>
<p>蘇俄力能東西應戰蘇俄自信力能同時在東西兩陣線備戰、而法國航空部谷特對於蘇俄空軍力量、頗有深切印象、聞曾向衆院外交委員會聲稱、蘇俄空軍力足使日陸相荒木躊躇顧慮云、（十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>胡氏方案中央贊同</h3>

<h3>孫氏南下尚未决定</h3>

<h3>殷同越權應予撤職</h3>

<h3>寧靜輪無法脱險　全部船員解散　損失達八萬餘元</h3>
<p>須明春漲水曳救寗紹公司寗靜輪、在長江上游迴風磯失事、船體高擱邊岸、損壞程度甚巨、本年無法來滬、船員水手與業務人員、已全體解散、業於昨日到滬、據船員所言損失狀况、分記如後、</p>
<h3>失事原委</h3>
<p>寗靜輪、於上月二十四日、在長江内觸礁、其原因並非遇霧、蓋迴風磯江面暗礁甚多、江海關在該處、設有警告航船之燈船一艘、上下水船、均視此燈爲行駛標準、詎意是日該燈船斷鍊走錨、方位易動、寗靜領江、不知其故、仍依燈光指示開航、致駛入暗礁叢中、釀成巨禍、事後、江海關對該輪船主道歉、並於翌日拖置原處、故寗靜失事、非船員失職也</p>
<h3>艙底破壞</h3>
<p>寗紹公司已將該輪船内貨物、全數卸駁出清、並派技師檢騐受傷處、發見船底左右艙、自頭部到中艙、被礁石觸破及受損壞者、有一百多就、且有數處破裂、因之機艙進水、經半個月進行救護工作、現破毁處已暫行塡補、並抽去積水、惟高擱礁上、無法曳入江中、</p>
<h3>船員解散</h3>
<p>此輪擱礁處、值江水日落、實難脱險來滬、公司議定、先將業務部與中艙部人員解散、送回滬上、今又將全體船員水手生火舵工等五十人、一律解散、已搭老寗紹輪於昨日到滬、各人薪工、發到昨日止、卽行停止、船内祗留大則一名、及生火與水手各二三人、以資看守、又恐匪刦、並派武裝士兵兩名、到船保護、</p>
<h3>損失重大</h3>
<p>寗靜輪此次觸礁、公司方面、除派船救護、以及駁貨等費用外、總外直接間接損失、須在八萬元以上、而停擱礁石長期被阻營業上損害更巨、此外全船職員以及茶房海員等、因而失業者、其損失亦匪淺鮮也、</p>

<h3>軒然大波　十二碼球分勝負　曁南一比零克交大　賽畢交大學生毆打裁判員</h3>
<p>一聲吆喝沈回春身受重傷曁南與交通兩大學足球隊、昨會師徐家匯交通大學球塲、此係江大足球最重要之一暮、勝負有關錦標得失、窒其轟動一時、除兩校學生外、滬上球迷往觀者、亦甚踴躍、兩隊勢均力敵、旗鼓組當、交通於開始不久、卽負十二碼球、曁南遂以一比零勝、因之交大少數學生、不忍失敗之憤、歸咎於裁判員沈回春、一聲呼打、沈君頓被包圍、拳脚與旗竿交加、受傷非輕、秩序大亂、誠江大體恊會之大不幸也、茲將詳情述下、</p>
<h3>毆打裁判</h3>
<p>交通大學爲國内聲譽最好之學府、但江大足球賽時、屢次發生風渡、前年曁南在交大比賽、亦曾有毆打事件發生、原因則起於曁南學生之搶球、昨日曁南又至交大作戰、局勢頗爲和平、以爲當不致再生風浪、不料於比賽終了後、交大學生因僅負十二碼球一只、心殊不平、乃又發生毆打裁判員之軒然大波、啦啦隊之旗竿及喇叭筒、權作武器、當時全塲秩序大亂、可憐沈回春枉遭不幸、交大球員竟不上前排解、幸經少數執事者之救駕、擁入體育館中、記者欲入内訪問被毆之沈君、被一門神擋駕、交涉無效、故沈君傷勢如何、不得而知、</p>
<h3>慨乎言之</h3>
<p>江大足球賽、歷年風潮頻起、裁判員均裏足不肯擔任、經江大體育協會當局及各學校當局之保證、中華運動裁判會會員、始重允擔任江大比賽之裁判員、不料雙方甫經携手、枝節又生、且昨日之形勢、尤爲嚴重、爰比賽完畢以後、曁南球員將球踢入曁南學生看臺中、交大一部分學生卽湧上奪球、而一部份球員則追逐裁判員毆打、後球被交大學生奪回、沈回春則被羣衆包圍、飽餉老拳、形勢十分可怕、沈君自被保護者擁入體育館後、記者雖未能探得沈君被毆情形如何、傷勢諒必非輕、武裝同志在場、無法彈壓、去年陳吉祥在復旦被毆、交涉幾經半載、昨日沈回春又蹈覆轍、裁判員誠不易做、且近年來所發生之毆打風潮、均起之於江大體協會、比賽中大學體育風氣、依然未能走上正軌、試問包括京滬八大學而專以提倡大學體育之江大體協會將何以自慰、更何以對中華運動裁判會及被毆之裁判會會員耶、至於有知識羣衆情緒之激昻、若用之抗日救國、則中國可以救矣、</p>
<h3>名不副實</h3>
<p>球場風光、年年如是、無足記述交大有鑼鼓隊及啦啦隊在場打氣助威、曁南僅百餘學生在場參觀、標語旗幟、均甚簡單、體育館樓上懸Good　Luck　to　Nanyan之横額一幅、大鐘頂上、懸（福佑南洋）四字、圖書館頂上亦有一幅、但字句已忘、校門前最爲醒目者、則爲（勝敗不關榮辱、）但如此醒目之旗幟、不能名實相副、竟而致發生毆打裁判員之風潮、不免太（幽默）矣、</p>
<h3>十二碼球</h3>
<p>比賽形勢、頗稱客氣、裁判員執法公正、毫無痴點、巡邊員亦由運動裁判員委派梁文棟及陸翔千二君担行、以便從旁恊助、交大開球先攻、來來往往、雙方互有警險、但十分鐘時、曁南右翼尹貴義高球送交大門前、徐亞輝衝上接應、球尚未到、交大沈觀瀾已將徐拌跌、裁判員照章判交大十二碼球、由徐亞輝踢入、不意此球卽爲勝負關鍵、往後兩方各無所獲、曁南遂以一比零勝、</p>
<h3>球藝略述</h3>
<p>曁南前鋒不及交大、惟腿頭甚快、是爲交大所不及、顧尚勷實爲曁南之功臣、左右招顧、百無一失誠有一夫當關、萬夫莫敵之槪、急難之中、均由顧君化險爲夷、陳鎭祥亦甚賣力、守門葉培初種健非凡、救出險球不少、以守衛而論、曁南勝於交大、惟交大王長頴的確利害、交大能保住不失、此君予有力焉、沈觀瀾之中堅、行動遲緩、球到脚上、每被對方搶出、前鋒線缺少打門人材、攻勢多於曁南、惜均射成野球、否則不難成相反之局面也、</p>

<h3>冷落逸園中　優游勉勝西商　－三比二－</h3>
<p>▲雙方表演平常毫無精彩</p>
<p>▲西商雖老有時亦能振作西風獵獵、日光作淡黄色、西商與優游、昨日會師於逸園、作甲組比賽、往而觀者、不足三百人、景象十分悽慘、雙方表演、亦十分疏忽、結果優游勉力以三對二勝、茲述其戰况如下、</p>
<h3>藏萊破門</h3>
<p>三時旣届、兩隊四塲擇門而後、交綏開始、優游向西對日作戰、西商前鋒、不時在優游内地騷擾不清、江善敬鞠躬盡瘁、數救險球、孫鐵腿没精打彩、三失良機、時間匆匆、如白駒過隙、往來至三十五分鐘時、西商傾師來窺、莊世鴻雖曾與史篤克作一度糾纏、但無效果、史氏遥傳一脚、爲茂萊得之轉身掃射先獲一球、</p>
<h3>巧生扳轉</h3>
<p>優游在失一球後、前鋒始見稍稍振作、但西商中軍、爲埠際虎將史篤克最後防線、爲大將法朋所鎭守、孫鐵腿雖有萬夫不擋之勇、亦難施展身手、俄李石友帶球進攻、薛勿一阻不得、克力斯台迎圍搶來、爲孫氏中路截住、轉送與巧生、砰然一脚、谷特金措手不及、乃能秋色平分、再戰少時、檸檬出場、雙方休息、</p>
<h3>樹棠被罰</h3>
<p>下半時互易陣地後、優游仍無起色、前鋒非常散漫、屢失良機於咫尺間、孫鐵腿迎門一射、惜稍偏五寸、陳家球又在十二碼相近處、不能當機立斷、西商數遭大難、而能不死、及覺勇氣頓加、福洛斯帶球至低線、傳中成浮接住對門射去、梁樹棠行動不愼、不幸手吻球皮、被罰十二碼、史篤克主罰、一蹴入網、西商遂又以二對一佔先、</p>
<h3>最後勝利</h3>
<p>孫錦順處此逆境、怒憤之氣、溢於眉宇、梁樹棠又急欲將功抵罪、與家球對調、前鋒頓見活躍、史篤克時時有顧兼不到之嘆老黄得球就退交鐵腿單刀直入、谷特金魂不附體、奔出效險、孫錦順科一記又成和局、梁樹棠野心極大、五分鐘後帶球深人、傳入中路、鍾勇森待射爲克後衛逼成角球、巧生開來恰到好處、鍾勇森在人業中建立大功、此後優游曾有數度猛烈射門、惜皆未命中、乃告結束、</p>

<h3>足球决賽　金陵保持冠軍</h3>
<p>三比零克約翰金陵約翰之足球决賽、於昨日下午一時舉行、金陵以三比○勝保持足球冠軍、兩方實力、無大軒輊、惟金陵前鋒、連絡純熟、約翰中衛綫、與前鋒、不能呵成一氣、每球已深入金陵腹地、而前鋒猶本趕到、失機良多、許文奎於上半時、失去十二碼罰球、亦爲約翰之致命傷、終以三比○失去錦標、茲將比賽詳情、分誌於後、</p>
<h3>約翰四面楚歌</h3>
<p>開賽後、金陵傾師進攻五前鋒近右衝突、約翰四面楚歌、幸董安邦鎭靜可取、得保江山、金陵陳士凱林堅學、兩度妙射、均爲阿董抱住阿斗、何學泉輸送得法、章文治不及阻攔、陳士凱西郊放馬、約翰内部空虚、驚險萬狀、幸孫寳珊趕主救駕、化險爲夷、</p>
<h3>阿奎失去良機</h3>
<p>約翰度過風波、許文奎陳輝棠劉明德連絡前進、金陵不免慌張、趙藹以手觸球、由許文奎主踢、失之過準、爲弱禮謙救出、約翰失此良機、力圖挽救、再度進攻、金陵一波未平、一波又起、胡承基傳中得法、周立賢頭頂、反造約翰機會、葉德明乘機叩門、爲柱所阻、約翰兩失良機不免慌張、</p>
<h3>黑皮一舉成功</h3>
<p>金陵進攻、拱德生盤球前進、章文治不該造成角球、拱德生主踢、落點甚佳、陳士凱故意漏卸、林堅學不慌不忙、射中一球、董安邦回天乏術、金陵遂以一比○勝上半時、</p>
<h3>約翰又失一城</h3>
<p>易地再戰、金陵力圖保守、黑皮退任中堅、約翰報復心切、内部不免空虚、拱德生高球排中、許光耀鄧明海跳起頂球、未見功效、曾毓龍出兵斜谷、居然貫革直入、金陵二比○勝、</p>
<h3>祖修大定天下</h3>
<p>約翰雖皮反攻、佘前鋒失之遲緩、未見功效、金陵氣勢益盛、何學堯奔馳迅速、傳遞得法、約翰後衛出師未回、不能後顧、董安邦衝出搶球、門内空虚、祖修射門、失之太高、驚魂方定、何學堯載欣載奔、周誠未及阻止、何學堯高挑傳中、劉祖修奔前一啣、天下遂定、約翰竟以三比○慘敗、金陵遂保持冠軍、</p>

<h3>求知的鑰</h3>
<p>— 康屯</p>
<p>小孩子没有個不喜歡（問）的；除非是天生的聾子，啞子。世界上是無奇不有的，我們跟前不知道有千千萬萬的奇怪事物。任保兒童，任何地方，任何時間，一切的週邅，都會引起我們的疑問。可是誰能一個個解答這些疑問呢？</p>
<p>不要説兒童們，就是大人們也每每給尋常的問題窘住。他們不能解答，只好去翻書本，或者去問問博學多能的人。可是一切所有的書本，所有智慧的人，不能解答世間一切所有的疑問。於是好學不倦的人們，只得仗著天生的兩手五官和大腦，努力去探索自然界的神奇。</p>
<p>小朋友們！起碼，我們要能認識了解日常生活的事事物物。可是事實上却也談何容易。有些博學之士，窺天測地，他會告訴你天空中行星的體積，重量，距離等等；却不能告訴你一碗飯怎樣到你嘴邊，一根火柴怎樣燃燒到木柴上去。</p>
<p>我們應該用我們的眼睛多多看。不但看它的表面，還要看出它的骨子來。用我們的心思多多想，要憑著實地試騐想出它的究竟來。越是尋常習見的事物，你只要剝春筍似地一層層去剝，一步步去推敲，便越饒興趣，越有心得，越加使你欲罷不能。</p>
<h3>侵曉號聲</h3>
<p>— 石愚生</p>
<p>（𠚣丫𠚣丫𠚣一）（𠚣一𠚣一𠚣丫）的號聲，驚破了我的睡夢，攪碎了我的心靈，但我感覺着的，不是凄凉，也不是憂煩，</p>
<p>萬重關山，千里江河。我飛過了那崎嶇的峯巒，我跨越了那淘湧的怒濤；我爲著我的祖國，我爲著我的民族，去，去去！多少豪壯，多少激昻！</p>
<p>蓬斷草枯，冰堅霜白。我踐踏著那遍地的荆棘，我抖擻著我金鋼的體魄；我爲著我的祖國，我爲著我的民族，殺，殺，殺！多少痛快，多少慷慨！</p>
<p>我不禁一躍而起了。殘月，灑落著絲絲銀光；曉風，舞弄著我的衣角。</p>
<h3>小松樹的幻想</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>樹林裏面的小松樹，他覺得自己長着針一樣的葉子，非常難看。他想：（假如我的葉子是金的，那就好看了）。管樹的天使曉得了小松樹的意思，晚上便全給它換成了金葉子。第二天早晨，樵夫看見小松樹上的金葉子，就都拿它摘去了。小松樹嘆了口氣説：（金葉還不及嫩綠的闊葉子好）。管樹天使便又給他換葉子。小山羊走過，看見一片片的嫩葉，便都給它吃去了。小松樹想：（闊葉子也不行，玻璃葉子一定是好的了）。管樹的天使，又給他換上玻璃葉子。到了晚上，北風大起，玻璃葉子都給風刮斷了。小松樹悔悟了，他説：（别的葉子都不及我原來的針狀葉子好）從此小松樹再也不敢痴心妄想了。</p>
<h3>空氣的作用</h3>
<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>王兒看見母親燒開水，把扇子向爐口扇動，火焰漸漸發生起來，不多時間，壺内的水，有一種響聲，揭開壺蓋一看，水面有許多氣泡，達於温度上沸點了。王兒的母親，又將已燃着的炭，拴置罐中，復再加蓋，炭即熄火，王兒看見這樣情形，問他母親發火熄火，是何理由，母親説：（你的發問，是很有價值的，從前英人瓦特，因爲看見他的母親燒水，蒸汽將壺蓋掀動，因此感觸，發明蒸汽機關，至今乃有火車輪船的行駛。可見尋常日用事，都含有科學原理，人須空氣生活，是你，知道的，空氣中有一種養氣，又名酸素，能助燃燒。用扇子扇爐，就是多送空氣入爐中，使有多量養氣，助着燃燒，所以炭就有火熖了。及至水已沸騰，無須烈火，故將炭放入罐中，加蓋隔絶空氣，即是隔絶養氣，没有養氣，即不助燃燒，所以炭自熄滅，留備將來再用。）</p>
<h3>下滿了一鼻子水</h3>
<p>— 學范</p>
<p>弟弟是最愛聽故事的。有一次姊姊並不講故事，伊就把教科書上談起的（生物）兩字，趣味地講了。</p>
<p>伊説：世界上任何種生物，它必有合乎生存的條件，否則早已淘汰了。譬如蚱蜢的顔色，和青草差不多；蟬的顔色，和樹皮差不多。因此孩子們便難捉住它了，所以這些顔色，稱爲保護色。</p>
<p>再説：譬如我們人類身體上的各部，也都合乎生存的條件的。你想假若我們的嘴，不是横生而是豎生了，試問下起雨來，不要下滿了一鼻子水嗎？</p>
<p>弟弟聽得怪有趣的，嘻嘻地笑了</p>
<h3>勇敢的小朋友</h3>
<p>— 行易</p>
<p>當西天的太陽，藏去了光芒以後，祗有幾點疏星，在黑暗的空中閃爍着。小孩們不怕黑暗，成羣的奔過小橋！（冬！）水面上突然起了極大的漩渦，一個小孩，掉到橋底下的水中去了！　　（呀！救命！救命！）</p>
<p>正在危急的當兒，一位勇敢的小朋友，不待脱衣脱鞋，一聳身，跟着跳入漩渦未定的水中。這裏的水流，本來很急的。他的游泳術，却也非常熟諳！所以在許多觀衆和小孩拍手歡笑聲中，居然把掉下去的小孩，救了起來！</p>
<p>這位勇敢的小朋友是誰？讓我來介紹一下：他是無錫查家橋小學十歲的學生；華敦。</p>
<p>１、明兒和兔弟在外面散步恰巧碰着鵝太太１、２、鵝太太就生一个蛋給他玩玩２、３、明兒很快活地帶回家去交猪妈打閘來看着裏面是什麽３、４、原來就是鵝太太的兒子啊（敏土作）４、</p>
<h3>一個誠實的孩子</h3>
<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>敏兒是個十一二歲的小孩，他有一張粉紅色的臉，櫻桃般的嘴，和一雙烏黝黝的眼睛，他終日笑嘻嘻的玩著，動著，怪可愛的。誠實是他的德行；智慧是他的天賦。</p>
<p>師表，父母，都很喜歡他，稱讚他；因此他很舒適的過著快樂的生活。報紙的封面上，常常登載著四個大字，是什麽呢？就是（航空救國）四個字，是要請人家多多的捐欵呀！</p>
<p>這天的下午，大約在三點鐘的光景，敏兒欣欣然的背了書包，一同跟了鄰家的孩子回家，他走進了屋子，見了他的父母親，很恭敬的行了一個禮，這是他日常慣做的事。</p>
<p>走進了他的小書房，放掉了書包，看見桌上有一堆報紙，著眼就看見這四個觸目的大字：（航空救國），要大家捐錢，不論多少。</p>
<p>於是他的腦海裏一轉：</p>
<p>（去年一二八淞滬之役，木屐兒的飛機，何等厲害，盤轉在我們的頭頂上，還要時時擲下一個個又大又重的炸彈來。我國的人民死的死了，傷的傷了；房屋燬的燬了，燒的燒了；好不傷心呀！還是讓我們快捐一些錢，買幾架飛機，來鞏固我們的國防。）</p>
<p>於是他輕輕的走到了他母親藏錢的那兒，去拿了一元大洋，一溜烟的走到那捐錢的銀行裏，捐了那塊銀元。</p>
<p>第二天，母親發覺伊失掉了一塊錢，就問家裏的人拿了没有？敏兒從那小床上起來，走出了臥室，不説謊的招承著説：（是我拿的，是我捐到航空救國會裏去的，請母親饒恕了我罷。）他的母親，見了他那玲瓏活潑的形態，也不怒了，把他抱了起來，吻著他説：（好孩子，你眞是一個誠實的孩子！你也是個愛國的孩子！）</p>
<h3>爲民族……國家去努力</h3>
<p>— 希實</p>
<p>愛華我兒：自從前年九一八事件發生以後，我們有多少同胞，去加入義勇軍了，這一種悲壯熱烈的情緒，已充塞大地，高騰雲霄。想你這些事知得很詳細了。</p>
<p>在我的胸中，早藴蓄了許多話，要同你説，在那時，你的年紀還小，恐怕你不懂，現在你的年紀稍長，况正是閩省政變，北事未了的現在，我的話有告訴你的必要了。</p>
<p>你的父親是國民軍北伐時南昌之役陣亡的，我慘淡地在人世爲你，雖然我飽經了無數的困難，而心中存着一個偉大的希望，掙扎到現在，愛華，你要知道我的希望嗎？我明白地告訴你吧！（我對於你所懷抱的那個惟一的偉大的希望，便是要你踏着你父親的足跡，爲民族去努力，爲國家去努力，）愛華，你不是屬於父母家庭的，你是屬於民族國家的，我永遠不需你孝敬，只希望你去孝敬民族，盡忠國家啊！</p>
<p>你的媽媽。</p>
<h3>兩件過失</h3>
<p>— 許宗傑</p>
<p>（一）在路上吃東西</p>
<p>媽媽昨晚不知道甚麽時候回來？現在還呼呼的好睡。啊喲！上課時間快到了，早餐還没有燒，怎樣辦呢？有了！在媽的枕底下，拿了六個銅子，去買一副大餅油條咬咬吧。上課要緊，邊走邊咬嚼。</p>
<p>眞糟！半路上遇見先生，要嚥嚥不下，要藏藏不及，硬着頭皮到校裏，給先生呌進訓育室裏，嚴斥了一頓。</p>
<p>（二）遲到了</p>
<p>星星期一的早晨，身子軟洋洋的睡在床上，眞適意呀，噹！噹！…時鐘打了九下。啊喲不好了！一骨碌起來，面也不洗；粥也不吃，挾了書包就跑，到校已是九點一刻。</p>
<p>先生鐵青着臉，問他爲甚麽這樣遲？祗得哭喪着臉説道：（媽昨晚領了我逛大世界，睡得遲了，所以不能起早）。先生鼻子裏哼了一聲，又是一頓訓斥。</p>
<h3>動物院</h3>
<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>某處地方，有一所動物院，雖然規模並没有十分宏偉，但是其中獅熊虎豹，珍禽奇獸，樣樣都有；所以小朋友都喜歡留連在這個好玩的去處。他們有的喜歡看鴛鴦戲水；有的喜歡聽鸚鵡學話；有的喜歡看獅子吃東西。但是這隻獅子，鎭日價只是打瞌睡，從未看見它動過一動，在獅子旁邊的籠裏，是一隻大熊，這大熊在先並没有人去十分注意它，但是近來愈長愈大了，並且會得把身子豎起來左右旋轉，博得人家歡喜，於是小朋友們都圍在大熊面前游玩。旁邊的睡獅，依舊沉迷不醒，兀自好睡的很。</p>
<h3>生物的變異</h3>
<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>今天同弟弟到野外去散外，回來的時候，弟弟有趣地説：（我看到野外的樹木，没有二株是相同的呢）我笑了一笑。</p>
<p>到了家裏，我呌弟弟同他的指尖蘸了墨汁印在白紙上，他就發覺了十個指印的紋路是各不相同的箕和籮固然不同，就是箕和箕，籮和籮也不是完全相像的。這時候，我，也將指尖塗了墨水印上去，和他的指紋比較，他又察知了兩個人的指紋是各不相同的。</p>
<p>於是弟弟明白了生物變異的現象。</p>
<h3>兒童世界一瞥</h3>
<p>— 文璞</p>
<p>上海先施公司，最近舉行兒童世界大會，會塲設於五樓，佔地甚廣，塲口兩旁，置鞦韆滑板木馬等游戲品，小朋友咸趨之若鶩。中間陳列一聖誕老人，笑容可掬，栩栩如生，場之左右，陳設各種新奇玩具，或及科學，或寓教育，而軍事戰事用品，尤稱逼眞，如飛機，大砲·兵艦·坦克車·機關槍·魚雷·潛水艇等武器，一一俱全。塲之極端，有鐵絲籠二架，籠内有袋鼠一頭，兩目炯炯，俯伏一角，另一籠則爲飛鳥，凡數十種，中植花木，下舖泥沙，飛舞其間，鳴聲悦耳。籠之側，有電影塲，放映教育影片，清晣可觀。電影畢，繼以小人國之跳舞會，滑稽突梯，圍而觀者甚夥，小朋友往來塲中，如穿花之蛺蝶，令人望而生愛。塲之中央，有好力克公司贈送奶粉，余適口渴甚，乃與客試飲之，其吸引力頗强，與好力克公司望衡對害者，乃摸彩處，客好奇，投一銀幣，摸珠一粒，對號領奬，竟獲彈子盤一具，值價約六七元，不可謂非小幸運也。綜觀全塲，琳琅滿目，美不勝收，誠兒童有益之娛樂場所，對於兒童智識之增進，大有裨益，茲社會局已批准明年爲（兒童年），尚望該公司當局，於明年擴大佈置，更添節目，展長會期，使各個兒童其樂，更望各地大商場，相率傚行，進而使全國兒童，同登樂園。</p>
<h3>農村小友的通問</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>▲開塲</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們：</p>
<p>我是八鄉底裏的人，享受不着都市的繁華：但我也不願來領略都市繁華——或許也是不可能的緣故罷？不過都市的情形，我很想知道。在要得都市小朋友的狀况之前，自然應該元將鄉村原本告訴你們：</p>
<p>（復興農村），（改造鄉村），我們小朋友們的耳鼓裏，也聽熟了。這想必是切要的問題；我以爲。啊，幸運！我就是今日大人先生們熱熱鬨鬨嚷着這切要的口號空氣極濃的而已做了五年鄉村改進工作的環境裏的一個鄉老。對於鄉村－這個已經改進而生氣勃勃的鄉村裏的事物更多；我從此和你們通信，我來報告你們鄉村的景色，你們－都市的小朋友們，也將都市上的事物，尤其你們活動的情形，請告訴我！</p>
<p>——我們的通信，現在開場了；從此，－</p>
<p>祝你們康健。</p>
<p>▲相知</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們：</p>
<p>自從那第一封信發出以後，居然增加心靈上許多安慰。因爲當這信達到你們的面前，我所懷着滿腹的思維，你們也可知道了。一個人生在世界上感着最快樂的，要算人和人間能（相知）。（相知之樂）古人就羨慕了。何况在人情澆薄，大家猜忌着；往往在微笑裏藏着鋒刀利丸，在甜言蜜語中組織着殺人不見血的機關。這個世界裏的（相知），更屬可貴！社會上不能（相知），就（砰砰篷篷）地你砲我槍，弄得烏烟瘴氣。我們小朋友各個一顆皎潔的心兒，光明的胸懷，永久保持着，保持着。</p>
<p>我們小朋友們的赤心，來用我們的熱情，將它團鍊起來。世界上的兒童的心，都是（和平），（相親相愛）的。因爲已團鍊成一顆光明燦爛的童心。什麽嫉惡，憤恨懷疑…這是大人們的勾當，這是化外。</p>
<p>小朋友啊！記着：我們是赤裸裸愛（好）的（人）！</p>
<p>完了。</p>

<h3>銀價與中國物價水準之關係</h3>
<p>（三續）路易士張履鸞作</p>
<p>（四）中國能否避免物價低落</p>
<p>在中國欲得到某種永久的物價水準、若以銀價爲單位、而能改變其銀洋之兌換率、使與物價之變化、互相抵消、似亦未始不可獲得、惟實行此種幣制時、對於以下各點、至須注意或預備、　　（一）至少須有一確實可靠之批發珴價指數、且可代表中國大部分之情形者、如目下之上海指數及華北指數、所代表之範圍、尚嫌過狹、</p>
<p>（二）凡兌換紙幣之白銀數量、須在某規定時間以内常有變動、假使批發物價指數、降低百分之一、那末每一銀洋所能兌換之銀數、亦須同時降低百分之一、而能與以前未降低時互相一樣了、反之、若物價增高百分之一時、則抵消之法、莫若同時使每一銀洋所能兌換之銀量、亦同時增高百分之一、理與上同、</p>
<p>（三）無論各種債務契約、或其他擔保等等、無論何時皆可正式訂定或履行、銀價之高低、不必計及、因銀洋之兌換率、與物價之高低相附而行、雙方可以毫無損益　　此種幣制本位、有時亦可稱爲一商品貨幣制實亦無異於一不固定之銀本位、若欲一不固定之銀本位、使其能控制國内一般之物價水凖、則第一白銀出口、無須限制、第二國内之自由兌券、亦無須加以制裁、</p>
<p>中國洋價、向以固定重量之銀價爲準、銀價若高、物價卽跌、故固定物價水準、似屬要圖、然而增加關税、重微輸入品、奬勵輸出、限制生産、估定物價、恐皆非其倫、無甚效果、</p>
<p>從一九二九年起、金本位國家、物價跌落甚連、當國者曾用多種方法、如上所舉者以固定此種彼種之物價、但其結果、無一能如吾人之願、而解憂之法、却賴於放棄金本位、因如此可以解放貨幣之價格、不致與金價互組糾纏、以後金價卽漲、亦無關於貨幣也、</p>
<p>但世界各國、亦有不至經濟情形完全破産、尚不肯捨去金本位者、此種國家、將來對於社會上或政治上之嚴重紊亂、恐將不能免也、</p>

<h3>花與葉</h3>
<p>— 仲方</p>
<p>看了（中國電影藝人訪問記）第二十六，（這是訪問（鐵板紅涙錄）導演洪深先生的），稍稍明白了當代前進的（電影藝人）正有一個急待解决的問題－即（花與葉）的問題。（訪問記）中借了（友人某君）的嘴巴説：</p>
<p>（……所以我總這樣想，我畫了這朶花，我自己以爲很像了，我的個性也表現出來了，可是别人説還得加幾筆葉子，而我却不想加上去，因爲我以爲這是没有必要的。）</p>
<p>這是一個主張：不要葉。被訪問的洪深先生以爲（我們的作品就是太少了葉子）。這是傾向於（要葉）的。而（訪問記）的作者沙基先生的意見則是（折中）的。他説：</p>
<p>（不消説我並同意以無謂的噱頭來趣味化，可是技術上生動化的成就，仍是非常必要的。至於因太顧全生動以致毒害主題，那自然是再愚笨不過的事了。然而在花之外多加上兩筆綠葉，使眞實生動化而更加眞實起來，這便是藝術的眞價。）</p>
<p>（花與葉）這一問題槪要具如此。本來中國有句老古話：牡丹雖好，全仗綠葉扶持，光是一朶牡丹花，並不好看，必待帶葉，然後完成了牡丹之美。所以（葉子）在這裏並不是帮襯，而是完成（牡丹之美）的必要條件。花與葉是對立的，相成的，而不是一個爲主體，一個爲附屬。</p>
<p>藝術上的（花與葉）的問題，也應該如此去理解。問題不在（要不要加幾筆葉子）或（多加上兩筆葉子），問題是在那些葉子畫得對不對。倘使一朶牡丹花旁邊加上了菊花的葉子，弄得旣不像牡丹，又不像菊花，這纔眞眞是（没有必要的）。</p>
<p>如果花是牡丹花，葉也確是牡丹葉，那麽，即使葉子太多了些，也不至於（毒害主題）。因爲一朶牡丹兩張葉固然是牡丹，四五張乃至七八張業，也仍然是牡丹，不會變做了芍藥的。（葉子）而至於（毒害）了花（主題），一定是這些（葉子）和（花）本非同類。所以文藝上的（花葉問題），第一要認明花與葉是相需相成的，葉子不處於幫襯的地位；第二要注意是否配錯了葉子。質諸洪深先生等三位，以爲何如？</p>
<h3>朱湘之死</h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>朱湘是留學生·教授，而且是詩人。他在社會上總算是有相當地位的，不幸爲了生活，竟在最近跳揚子江死了。他爲什麽要自殺，還不大明白，但據許多人推測，生活窮困實在是這慘劇的最大原因。今年春天曾在北新書局見過他一面，當時我不蹺得是誰，只記得一個憔悴消瘦的面貌。後來經趙景深先生談起，才知道就是朱湘，説是已經離開了安徽大學，没有相當的職業，生活很爲難。他的文章近幾年來發表得很少，而且詩是賣不起錢的，要想靠這個維持生活眞是夢想。聽説有家雜誌要他的詩稿，因爲他要求四元一行，那位素愛揩油的編輯就很生氣的拒絶刊登。前星期六我在現代書局碰到杜衡先生，他説朱湘曾托朋友寫信給他，説是要替現代寫文章，但結果又不曾送去，不料竟是這樣慘的自殺了，眞出他意外。我當時還不相信，到昨天打電話去問了趙景深先生以後，才曉得眞有這回不幸的事情。</p>
<p>這件事報紙上面好像没有什麽記載，其實是很值得注意的，因爲它的意義並不限於朱湘一個人。這位詩人的性情據説非常孤傲，自視很高。據他想像他這樣一個詩人，雖然不能像外國的桂冠詩人一樣，有什麽封號；起碼也應該使他生活得舒服一點，使他有心情寫詩。可是這個混亂的中國社會，不但不給他舒服的生活，而且簡直不給他生活，這種冷酷他自然是感到的。他不能認識社會，了解社會，旣不承認能夠優容他，把他像花草一樣培養起來的某種環境已經崩潰，更不相信那個光明燦爛的時期眞會實現，所以他只看到一片深沉的黑黯。這種致命的絶望，使他没有生活下去的勇氣，使他不得不用自殺來解决内心的苦悶。</p>
<p>朱湘已死了，跟他選上這條死路的，恐怕在這大批彷徨跂路的智識羣中，還有不少的候補者罷。</p>
<h3>革命時代的夏里賓</h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>這兩天正在南京大戲院開演的影片（魔俠吉訶德），不論看過之後的人作何批評，牠在攝製的時候早就有了一種轟動全世界電影界的權威了。因爲這是塞凡提斯的傑作，西班牙文學的寳典，由保爾，穆杭編劇，巴索恩德導演，而是根據了馬沙奈的歌劇，由世界聞名的俄國歌人夏里賓主演的一個薈萃了文學，音樂，電影三方面第一流好手的影片。</p>
<p>關於這部影片本身，近來各報的電影欄内都在批評着，想必會有一個能代表大多數中國觀衆的意見决定下來。祇是關於夏里賓這個人，好像很容易被誤解的，因爲我曾在一篇批評該影片的文章上看見過一句話，説夏里賓是曾經在大革命前俄貴族劇院中很負盛名的，這句話的意思很容易暗示讀者，使他們相信夏里賓是一個侍奉貴族的歌伶，但是，事實上並不如此。</p>
<p>夏里賓於一八七三年生於俄國喀山附近的一個奥美代伏鄉村裏的一所貧民住宅裏，他底父親是在鄉公所裏當書記的。在小學讀書的時候，他連接被學校裏除名了兩次，一次是因爲與一個女學生親嘴，一次是與同學决鬭（其實是那同學打了他），於是他父親認他爲不可造就，把他送到喀山的一家皮鞋店裏去做學徒，那時候是十一歲。</p>
<p>皮鞋店間壁是一家麵包店，在這麵包店裏有一個工錢掙得最少，但是書讀得最多的年青的麵包師，他的名字在當時是呌做阿列克賽伊·馬克西莫維支·沛希柯夫，在如今就呌做馬克西莫·高爾基，蘇聨的大文學家。</p>
<p>高爾基如果没有認識夏里賓，如果後來的艱苦的流浪生活没有損壞了他底歌喉，也許他現在並不是一個蘇聨的文豪，而是一個名列第二的歌唱家的。因爲在充當麵包師的時候，高爾基不但是他伙伴中的博學者，又是一個能每天以最好的歌唱娛樂他們的藝術家。反之，夏里賓如果當時没有認識高爾基，他就不會在他的流浪生涯中尋到更好的同伴，他就不容易受到高尚的文藝影響，他的歌唱勢必趨於下流，成爲江湖派，因而無聞於世。所以他們兩人的友誼，對於他們兩人的事業實在有很大的帮的。</p>
<p>因爲不耐那無希望的苦役，一個逃出了麵包店，一個逃出了皮鞋店，他們兩人合夥兒流浪在各個鄉村裏。夏里賓沿路賣歌，高爾基却不敢唱歌了，他給人們講故事。這流浪生涯替他們各人奠定了藝術的基礎。</p>
<p>據夏里賓自己在最近的英國（讀書人一雜誌中發表的（藝術背後的人生）一文中，他曾叙述着他從這次的流浪生涯中懂得了一個歌人如果要得到廣大的聽衆，他不但需要一個技巧的歌喉，而且必須使他的歌曲（活躍），必須把自己（没入）在自己的音樂裏，必須使自己（成爲所扮演着的脚色。</p>
<p>從十九歲加入一個歌劇團，掙二十盧布一月開始，直到俄國革命爆發的前夜，夏里賓從歌美旅行回來，做了莫斯科皇家劇院的臺柱。那時候，他確實是一個貴族們的藝術供奉者，因爲貧窮的人簡直聽不起他的戲，但這並不是他的錯。在一九二七年出版的他底自傳裏，他記載着一個故事，是很足以使我們了解他的，現在節譯在這裏：</p>
<p>（當鮑爾札維克佔據了克龍斯達的時候，有一羣兵士和水手來要求我給他們開一個音樂會。我立刻就答應了，但有些朋友却勸我拒絶了他們。</p>
<p>（這是危險的，）他們説，（説不定這是一個詭計，他們要説你是資産階級而殺死你的）。</p>
<p>（爲什麽他們要殺死我呢？）我説，（我没有得罪他們。或許我的歌會得替他們平平氣憤的。）</p>
<p>於是我在一所宏大的騎兵學校裏演奏了。大約有一萬五千個水手，兵士，工程師，火夫和婦女來聽着。有一個工程師，他好像是曾經聽過音樂會的，當每一支歌曲唱完的時候，他减着那個法文字“Bis!Bis！”（卽中文的（再來一個！）</p>
<p>可是旁邊有許多人却不懂這個字的意思，他們大槪誤會做小俄羅斯語的“Bis”這個字聲音雖近，可是意義却大大同了，牠的解釋是（魔鬼）。於是有一個青筋漲滿了的火夫立刻捲起袖子高聲喝問了：</p>
<p>（什麽混賬東西敢駡夏里賓，你再開一聲口，老子就打落你的牙牀！）</p>
<p>説着他把一個挺大的拳頭送上　去。</p>
<p>看見他們差不多要打起來了，於是有人給解釋了這個誤會。於是這義形於色的火夫搔搔頭皮對那工程師説：</p>
<p>（對不起，朋友，我没懂得。）</p>
<p>當我離開那裏的時候，我眞被門外等候着的那些人的祝賀感動了。有一個衣衫襤褸的老太婆注視着我，説道：</p>
<p>（謝謝你，謝謝你！親愛的費渥陀。依凡諾繼支（夏里賓之名），我到底聽了你的戲了！）</p>
<p>這樣地，在整整七年的恐怖的革命時期中，音樂的聲音從没有靜息過。這或許是因爲俄國人不能没有音樂而生活着的緣故。所以在沙皇統治之下的藝術在蘇維埃統治之下也還是藝術。）　　從這個故事中，我們可以知道夏里賓這藝術家，他不單是爲了貴族，也不單是爲了平民，他應該説是爲了人類的。同時，我們也可以體味着，只要是純粹的藝術，不論是在沙皇或蘇維埃之下，牠總是一樣的。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（六一）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>他們閉住嘴了。他以爲她會慌亂的，料不到她却這般安定，他本來期待着一些含有媚意的可愛的舉動，一些表示着應允的拒絶，他本來期待着在那蕩漾的水中，一面捕蝦，一面演出一齣俏皮的愛情喜劇！而現在完了，他覺得他祇説上二十句話便已經結合了，已經成親了。旣然他們兩人都同意了，那麽他們便再没有什麽話好説了，現在他們兩人對於剛才那樣迅速地經過的一切都感着一點窘迫，甚至還有點兒慚愧，兩人再不敢説話，再不敢捕蝦，簡直不知道要怎麽辦了。</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹的聲音救了他們：</p>
<p>（到這裏來，到這裏來，孩子們！來看看博寳汝呀。他把海都捕空了，這傢伙。）</p>
<p>博齊汝船長捕蝦的成績眞的好極了。他水浸到腰身，由這個泥沼到那個泥沼，祇一眼便認島那最好的地方，於是拿着他的蝦網以一種從容而又確當的動作，搜索着所有隠藏在海草底下的蝦巢。</p>
<p>而那些漂亮的透明的灰褐色的海蝦便在他的手心裏躍動着，當他以一個乾脆的手勢拿着牠們擲進背籃的時候。</p>
<p>陸醉米太太驚異着，高興着，再也不離開他了，盡力地模儀着他，差不多把她允許的事和跟在她後面夢想着的哲安都忘記了。祇一心沉浸在那從飄浮着的草下撈取海蝦的孩子般的快樂裏。　　羅蘭突然呌着：</p>
<p>（看啦，羅蘭太太跑到我們這裏來了。）</p>
<p>她起初一個人和筆爾留在海難上，因爲他們兩人彼此都没有到礁石上去跑，到瀦水裏去搜索的欲望；可是他們却躊躇着不敢留在一塊。她怕他，而她的兒子也怕她和他自己，怕他自己那種不能自制的殘酷。</p>
<p>後來他們終於靠得很近地坐在砂灘上。</p>
<p>，兩人一同在那被海風緩和了的暑熱中，對着那閃着銀光的藍色海水的浩瀚且本和的水平線，同時想道：（倘在以前，這地方的天氣該是怎樣使人舒服啊！）她不敢和筆爾説話，她知道他會給她以一個冷酷的回答；他也不敢和他的母親談話，他知道自己會不自由主地出之以兇暴。</p>
<p>他用棍尖蹂躪着那些圓圓的砂石，他轉動它們並打擊它們，她呢，兩眼朦朧着，抓了三四顆石頭在手裏，以一穏迂緩的機械的手勢，把它們由這個手遞到那個手。隨後，她那向着前面游來游去的飄忽不定的眼光，在海草中間看出了和陸太太在一塊捕蝦的她的兒子。於是她把眼睛跟着他們，窺看着他們的動作，她以母親的本能，模糊地領會到他們像平常一樣没有交談一句話。當他們在水面照看着時，她看見他們並排的彎着腰；當他們試探着他們的心時，她看見他們面對面的站立着；隨後她看見他們爬上礁石，坐在那上面締結婚約。</p>
<p>他們的影像很明顯的浮現在那彷彿祇有他們兩人在的水天相接的背景中間，他們的影像在這天，海和岸壁的廣大的空面，現着一種偉大的氣槪並且像象徴着什麽似的。</p>
<p>筆爾也議見他們，他的嘴唇裏突突發出了一聲乾笑。</p>
<p>羅蘭碼：並不曾轉過身來，但她問他道：</p>
<p>（你怎麽的？）</p>
<p>他老是嘲笑着：</p>
<p>（我在學習。我現在懂得了人家是怎樣地準備着做烏龜。）</p>

<p>世界語研究專号　　蔡元培先生曰：中國人用世界語可以促進中西民族的互相了解。</p>
<p>葉餘漫啖</p>
<h3>讀本期專號最大的感觸</h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>在我們决定發刊這三期世界語專號之後，我們就把專號的内容分成三方面，那就是：</p>
<p>（一）世界語運動的史略及一般的槪論；（二）世界語在今日國際間的地位；（三）世界語運動在中國各地的情形。當記者編審這一期的稿件叙述中國各地世界語運動的情形時，我們可以很顯然的看出，世界語運動在中國的程度，除了上海北平廣州等處，稍有生氣外，各省内地仍大多數居於絶無僅有的景况，這當然不足以爲世界語運動的前途憂慮，因爲這個現象的嚴重性，乃是反襯着中國文化水凖的一般的低落。我們看到全國出版界普遍的不景氣情况，即知大多數國人對於本國文的書報尚且如此冷淡，對於（世界語）之無暇顧及，自屬理所當然了。不過文化爲一個民族的代表，若是文化日趨衰落，即所以表示此民族的生氣亦必日形衰弱，所以凡從事復興民族運動者，必首先注意復興文化的工作，文化復興了，民族始有生氣，有生氣的民族方有革命的精神。我們默察今日大多數的中國民衆，處此種天災人禍帝國主義政治經濟侵略的層層壓迫之下，仍是苟且偷安的情形，深有感於中國民族革命成功的爲期尚遠了！從事世界語運動的工作者，在這種環境下自然要遇到異乎尋常的困難，但是他們所負的一部份復興文化的責任，却也因此而隨之特别加重了，這是記者讀了中國世界語運動情形後所生的一個最大感觸，質諸世界語的學者們，以爲何如？</p>
<h3>國内世界語運動　世運在北平</h3>
<p>— 鍾天啟</p>
<p>大約還在民元前後，北京城内順城根願學堂那邊，出現了個（世界語傳習所）。主持人金夢厂，教師吳天民。開班雖僅一月，學者却有七八十人。據説這是北平最初的世界語運動。不久之後，蔡元培任教育部長，北京的世界語運動，在教部的倡導之下，獲得了頗大的進展。於是願學堂的（世界語講習所），由（私辦）而發展到（官辦）。那個殷紅的篆文圖章（教育部屬世界語專門學校），至今還在北京大學的圖書館裏。</p>
<p>那時北京大學世界語學會的組織也活躍起來了。北大添設世界語課程，教師孫羃璋，與俄國盲詩人愛羅先珂均曾主講北大。現在的北大出版部，還可買到當時幾種世界語讀物。</p>
<p>在這初期運動中，值得一記的是，在北大第三院大禮堂中曾舉行柴門霍夫誕辰慶祝大會。這個隆重的大會，參加者達一千餘人，與會要人有大總統代表劉春霖，教次沈步洲，外次顧維鈞等，用世界語演説的有謝里謝夫，孫國璋，愛羅先珂。</p>
<p>前國民第二軍軍長胡景翼，是位熱心世界語的人。孟瑞胡同的（世界語專門學校），即在胡氏的支持下於民國八九年間開辦的。教師爲馮省三，謝里謝夫，陳聲樹等。當時人材頗不算少，教學成績亦好。現在主持綏遠世運的王錫周，就是這個學校畢業的。可是後來因政局變動，該校也就停辦了。</p>
<p>初期北平的世運，一方面固然是靠了教育部等等上面的提倡，另一方面也因爲社會對於世界語要求的迫切，以及對於人類和平等理想的共鳴，否則也决不能成爲一個運動的。</p>
<p>九一八之後，隨着反帝抗日運動的高漲，北平的世運也重新蓬勃起來。北京大學首先成立講習班，其餘各校亦都創設世界語學會。</p>
<p>一九三二年一月，成立了（北平世界語者同盟），在他們的宣言裏説：（爲要眞正地從被壓迫的地位解放出來，必須獲得一種溝通各民族間的聨絡，增加大衆文化的武器。）</p>
<p>此外尚有（北平世界語學會聨合會），這是各學校世界語學會的指導統一機關，並派講師赴各地教授。如北京大學，師範大學，中國學院，朝陽學院，北平師範大學，女子學院，女子一中，翊教女中，農學院，工學院，清華大學，安中，鹽務，警高，商學院………等各學校，均曾開班傳習。尤其是北大和師大，初級班先後各開過七次，每次平均各有學生三十餘人。高級班各開過一次</p>
<p>一九三二至一九三三年的北平，與上海同爲中國世運的兩大支柱，充滿着活潑新生的氣象。本年北平世界語者，鑒於（學會聨合會）只是各學校學生世界語團體的總會，社會人士無從參加，爲免除這個缺點，因此成立了（北平世界語者恊會籌備會），積極推進北平的世運。並在華北著名大報（世界日報）上，出一副刊（世界語之光），每逢星期五出版。該週刊自本年六月二十三日創刊以來，已出了二十多期了。</p>
<p>很明顯地，北平是目下華北世運的中心，它的前途充滿着希望。北平一般社會人士，對於世界語亦頗有理解。有不少書籍雜誌，都已摒除英語，而改用世界語的副題。（世界日報）一九三四年的日歷，也用世界語來標誌月份及星期。平地的報紙，頗歡迎刊登有關世界語的文字。而華北其他各地，受了北平世運進展的刺戟，也在開始活躍起來。最近天津（北洋大學世界語學會）的成立，便是一例。　　從這些事實裏，我們可以知道：北平的世運，不單有着偉大的將來，而對於中國整個的世界語運動上，也是有着重大的意義的。</p>

<p>世界語專論</p>
<h3>中國世界語運動的回顧與前瞻</h3>
<p>— 經兆莘</p>
<p>世界語運動在中國差不多已有三十年的歷史了。這三十年的歷史，可分成三個時期；使最初到一九一四年爲止，可以説是（空想時期）。在當時提倡世界語的先輩，大多醉心於世界語創始者柴門霍夫的（内部理想），把世界語運動當作宗教）一般地熱烈地宣揚着，這些先驅者的精神和毅力是值得欽佩的，但是他們過分把世界語理想化了，以爲從世界語本身便可獲得和平友愛的憧影，却把世界語運動和現實問題分離着，這是初期世運的缺點。</p>
<p>一九一四年世界大戰爆發，同時中國政治也入於黑暗時代，理想主義破滅，世界語運動便歸於消沉。直到一九一八年以後，因五四運動的喚起，中國的世運，從新抬頭。當時的世運，注意在實際應用方面，世界語研究用書的編印，雜誌刊物的發行，各地補習班與函授學校的創立，職業界（如郵電界等）對於世界語的開始注意，以這一時期爲最盛。同時對於世界語文字構造及效能的辯論，世界語和國語的關係，在這一時期更引起一般人的注自。所以這一個時期，可以稱爲世運的（實用時期）。</p>
<p>一九二六——七年的大革命襲來。世界語運動漸爲人們所忽略。但是這政治社會的大騷動暫時過去之後，世界語運動捲土重來，不過另換了一個面目，就是由（實用時代）而入於（抗爭時期）。原來一九二六年以後，中國的民族解放運動，與國際的廣大解放運動發生密切的關係，中國正走向航爭的路線，而世界語因其爲溝通各民族感情，尤其爲促進各國大衆團結的利器，所以能成爲一種奮鬥的工具。因此，在這個時期中，世界語已不僅是一種有閑階級的消遣品，世界語主義也不再是一種帶有麻醉性的和平幻想了。</p>
<p>因此可見世界語和世界語運動並不是超歷史範疇的。反之却是跟着時代的變化而繼續不絶地發展成長着。在世界語運動的初期，中國正在文化革新的啓蒙期，空想的和平博愛主義代表當時的思想特徴，所以所謂（内部理想）成爲當時世界語運動的基調。不過這時代已消滅了，代表這時代的世界語理想也不能不歸於消滅，即使要指出老牌子，迷戀骸骨，那有什麽用處？第二個時期的世運，是比較地切合實際，但這是跟着五四後中國小資産階級的抬頭而興起的。這一個時代，現在也在崩潰了，所以實用主義的世界語觀，也依然不能建築起來。我們只要看初期的世界語倡導者，到現在不但不再談世界語和和平博愛主義，而且成爲一切文化革新的障碍物，可見這世界語運動的第一時期是已死去了。再看五四時代提倡世界語最起勁的疑古玄同先生到底並没有自己研究世界語，實用世界語，那麽實用主義的世界語運動，有到怎樣的成績，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>時代是過去的過去，死滅的死滅了，但世界語和世界語運動却没有死滅，而且還獲得了新生。假如前輩的世界語者厭倦了世界語，離開了世界語運動，青年人和勞動大衆却開始注意世界語，支持世界語運動。自然，青年們和大衆需要世界語，並不是用以麻醉自己，構成自己的幻想，更不用以供個人的用途，而是把世界語用作社會的用途。只有認清了世運的社會的意義，才不是誤用了世界語。也只有從這裏，才能找得世運的廣大的前途。</p>
<p>中國在目前，和許多東方國家一樣，將從經濟文化的落後狀態，飛躍到時代的最前線。偉大的抗爭是在展開着。因此世界語運動在中國是有非常重大的任務。世界語運動近年在東方的發展比在西方更速，尤其是日本的世界語者，盡了比任何國家更大的努力。這决不是偶然的。在向前追趕時代的東方人，需要世界語作工具，是比西方人更來得迫切呢。</p>
<p>因此，世界語運動在中國的前途是不可限量的目前，在我們的前面，横着許多困難，這世運的新的階段的發展，還不過是微露曙光。只有青年們，才能負起責任，克復一切困難，使世語走上了廣大的新的路徑。</p>
<h3>世運在上海</h3>
<p>— 褚德明</p>
<p>上海是所謂（華洋雜處）的（國際都市），而且也是目下中國文化的中心，所以一般人士，對於國際文化，國際語問題，比内地的人要求得敏感。其次，因爲世界語運動在上海較有歷史，所以上海的世運，對於整個中國的世運上講來，是有着很大的意義的。</p>
<p>據説在一九○六年，上海就有劉師培先生設立講習班，這也許就是上海世界語運動的先聲。翌年陸式楷先生也在上海開班教授。劉先生現在不知怎樣了。陸先生記者曾會過幾面，據説是因商業關係而和俄國人接觸，陸先生的世界語是從一個俄國人那裏學來的。一九○九年，上海就有（中國世界語會）的成立，後來改組爲（中華民國世界語會），並開辦函授班，發行雜誌，並在常熟南京等處設立支部。這還是二十多年前的事，所以詳細情形就不很清楚了。</p>
<p>大約在一九二七年，江灣勞動大學曾以世界語列入課程，教授是日人山鹿泰治，用的是直接教授法（即不用中國語翻譯）。後來山鹿離滬返日，就由該校校醫祝枕江先生繼任。滬上世運，一時頗有聲勢。</p>
<p>在學校方面，復旦大學及立達學園等校，先後組織世界語學會。但是在（一二八）一役，不單江濟閘北受到了（皇軍）的砲火的洗禮，而上海的世界語運動也受到了致命的打擊。那時會所在閘北的（上海世界語學會），損失極大，會務陷於停頓。雖然表面上運動是中斷了，但是上海一部份青年世界語者在砲火的威脅下，仍没有忘掉他們的任務！據説那時就有不少同志，組織過（國際宣傳委員會），把日帝國主義的武裝襲擊，以世界語暴露於世界大衆之前，獲得了各國同情的聲援。</p>
<p>一二八之後不久，（中國世界語函授學社）也成立了。那時是上海唯一傳播世界語的地方。一九三二年十二月，（中國世界語函授學社）發起世界語展覽會，更獲得了很大的成功。一九三三年的一月裏，就成立了（上海世界語者協會），於是上海的世界語運動，又開始活潑的進展。</p>
<p>現在且把上海旣存的幾個世界語團體，來叙述一番：</p>
<p>上海國際世界語會成立於本年春間，會員中有中，日，英，奥…等多種民族，故定名（上海國際世界語會）。因爲成立不久，會員還祗數十人。本埠某無線電播音台，曾由該會播音教授世界語，一時學者頗多。該會曾計劃開辦講習班，但因種種困難，迄未實現。該會歡迎各國人士加入，會費每月五角，通信處爲上海郵箱一八七一號。</p>
<p>上海世界語學會爲中國有力世界語團體之一，成立極早。過去曾在（學生</p>

<h3>Northern Fujian Frontline Contact: Fujian Forces Ordered to Attack Yesterday, Central Army Engaging from Jian'ou</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Fujian puppet government has ordered over 3,000 Red bandits at the front, led by those holding sickle and axe flags, to advance from Yanping, frontline contact has occurred. The Central Army is engaging from Jian'ou with high morale. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Jiangshan Telegraph: The Central Army in Jian'ou is over thirty li away from the enemy vanguard. Three thousand Red bandits were absorbed and are now pushing hard to attack Zhejiang, attempting to break through the economic blockade and shock the Southeast. Contact is expected within ten days, between Jian'ou and Yanping. The Zhejiang border is secure. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) According to a certain prominent figure, the Central Army has now amassed a significant force around Pucheng and Jian'ou, with its vanguard over thirty li away from the enemy in Yanping, Northern Fujian. It could have directly attacked the Fujian stronghold, but due to a lack of clear orders, it is currently maintaining a strict guard in its original garrison. If the enemy advances, we are determined to deliver a crushing blow. The Fujian side only has 30,000 combat-capable troops, despite claiming over 100,000, which is inaccurate. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Tacit Agreement Between the 19th Route Army and the Communists =</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) It is widely believed here that the 19th Route Army has reached a non-aggression agreement with the Communist forces. It is rumored that a large number of Red Army soldiers in Changle, Shunchang and other places have joined the Independent Army. It is also said that 4,000 Red Army soldiers under Mao Zedong are currently stationed in Jianning. The Fujian army is not alarmed by this. (16th Reuters)</p>
<h3>= Occupation of the Gutian Catholic Church =</h3>
<p>Disregarding the protests of the clergy, this act has prompted a warning from the French Consul in Fuzhou today. The French Consul demands that the troops immediately withdraw from the church. (16th Reuters)</p>
<h3>= Mao Weisou and Others Send Letter Urging Chiang and Cai =</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Fujian news: 19th Route Army generals Mao Weisou, Shen Guanghan, Qu Shounian, Tan Qixiu, and others, fearing that the situation is worsening and that failure to reform soon will not only lead to the collapse of the puppet government but also personal ruin, have so far remained inactive, observing the situation from all sides. They are also sending letters urging Chiang and Cai not to sacrifice the entire 19th Route Army and its soldiers for the sake of Chen and Li's futile efforts. If Chiang and Cai remain obdurate, Mao and others will issue their own telegram, officially overthrowing the puppet government and supporting the Central Government. (16th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppet Troops Suddenly Attack Eastern Chahar, Advancing Along Northern and Southern Routes, Having Already Passed Dageting, Liu Guitang Retreats to Chicheng, Xifengkou Garrison Retreated, Japanese Side Claims the Military Operation Aims to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>(Beiping) More than a thousand Japanese puppet troops suddenly advanced from Fengning in Rehe territory on the 15th, in separate columns, toward Chahar, among them were seven Japanese. A military unit consisting of three to four hundred soldiers, carrying four heavy artillery pieces. Its spearhead had reached Longmensuo, two or three li east of Chicheng. Liu Guitang's troops, stationed in the area, caught unprepared, were attacked and retreated to Chicheng County. The northern route crossed the Great Wall via the Eighteen Pans Ridge, attacking Dushikou.

<h3>Dalai Lama Telegraphs, States Maintaining Peace According to Qinghai-Tibet Treaty, Mongolian Committee Believes There are Two Obstacles to Peace in Kang and Tibet, Has Telegraphed Dalai Lama to Await Central Government's Measures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gonjue Zhongni, the representative of the Dalai Lama, recently received a telegram from the Dalai Lama stating that the Tibetan side has no intention of renouncing the Qinghai-Tibet Treaty and is still maintaining peace according to the treaty.

(16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian Committee held a regular meeting on the 16th to discuss the Kang-Tibet issue. It was generally believed that, based on the Dalai Lama's recent reply, there are currently two obstacles to peace in Kang and Tibet: 1. The displaced monks of the Daqian Temple are wandering around and causing disturbances. 2. The issue of the restoration of Dege Zhan. The current countermeasures should first allow the displaced monks of the Daqian Temple to return to the temple to avoid wandering around and disturbing the overall situation. This is considered a short-term solution. A telegram should be sent immediately to the Kang Border Defense Army to comply nearby. As for the issue of the restoration of Dege Zhan, it concerns all sectors of Kang and Tibet, and it is not something that local authorities can decide on their own. It should be requested that the Central Government make other solutions. However, the current crisis is mainly that the Tibetan side has unstable actions. The Tibetan representative stationed in Beijing should be ordered to telegram the Dalai Lama again not to launch military operations and to await the measures of the Central Government.

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary: The Issue of Land Tax Reorganization</h3>
<p>According to a statement released yesterday by Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, he intends to propose a land tax reorganization plan at the upcoming Fourth Plenary Session, hoping to draw attention from all parties. The land tax in various provinces has always been extremely complex. Some areas have little land but heavy taxes, while others have abundant land but light taxes. There are also areas with land but no taxes. Since the implementation of tariff reduction, various provinces have lost a source of revenue and have begun to focus on land taxes, establishing various levies. These are collected by the provincial government, the county government, and the local garrison. Such levies include "educational surcharges," "defense surcharges," "militia surcharges," "autonomy donations," and "village and neighborhood donations," among others. There are numerous tax items, each with its own revenue and expenditure, with no auditing or oversight. This is enough to harm the country and the people. If these can be reorganized, it would remove accumulated malpractices and alleviate the burdens on farmers. The intention is certainly very good, and it is commendable that Kong is earnestly pursuing reform and making many plans at a time when society is in extreme turmoil and politics are frozen and unable to develop. However, I believe there are still some points that deserve discussion.</p>
<p>In recent years, rural areas in our country have gone bankrupt, and farmers have labored all year round without gaining anything, only increasing their losses. The suffering of farmers is unbearable. Over the past year, the government and financial institutions have worked together to establish various plans and implement them in order to revitalize rural areas. Such efforts include the establishment of the Rural Revitalization Committee, the establishment of the Four Provinces Farmers Bank, and the expansion of other agricultural financial enterprises. Remedial measures have been extremely thorough. However, in reality, there is no sign of prosperity in the rural areas of our country. This shows that the current decline of the rural economy seems to have other causes, and the relief provided by agricultural finance alone cannot be effective. Therefore, reorganizing land taxes for the purpose of relieving agricultural finance may not be able to achieve significant benefits. After the land tax reorganization plan is implemented, most of the benefits may still accrue to a small number of rent-collecting classes, and it is difficult to say whether producers will be able to recover or whether they will be affected by improvements. This is one point worth discussing for those who want to reorganize land taxes to relieve rural areas.</p>
<p>Secondly, will the purpose of reorganizing land taxes be to alleviate local financial difficulties? This is also questionable. Currently, local authorities lack uniform standards for local revenue and expenditure. The surcharges on land taxes sometimes exceed the regular tax by two or three times, or even seven or eight times. There are also other special revenues. If these are used frugally, they can also勉strongly support development to a certain extent. Therefore, the biggest reason for the current local financial difficulties is not insufficient revenue, but excessive spending. If this land tax reorganization is implemented carelessly, it could conveniently enable officials to extort money and gentry to manipulate the system. This is the second point worth discussing for those who want to reorganize land taxes to alleviate local financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, will the purpose of reorganizing land taxes be to adjust the tax system? This is certainly a worthwhile issue for discussion. The inadequacy of our country's land tax system has long been discussed by the people. Reorganizing it to achieve an equitable burden and eliminate accumulated malpractices to increase the actual revenue of the treasury is indeed an important task for both finance and taxation today. However, given the current situation of numerous local affairs and extremely inflated expenditures, all revenue has already been designated for specific purposes. Savings are difficult, and thorough reorganization is even more difficult. Moreover, when local areas are divided and controlled separately, it is not easy to say whether the central government's tax reform plan can be thoroughly implemented. This is the third point worth discussing for those who want to reorganize land taxes to pave the way for tax reform.</p>
<p>Therefore, land tax reorganization is indeed a necessary plan for reorganizing the entire national politics. However, at a time when there are countless problems and this issue is very complicated, it remains to be seen how Kong will carefully consider, promote benefits, and eliminate drawbacks with his grand strategy.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Representatives Go to Tianjin to Continue Discussing the Yuguan Takeover Issue. Shibayama Stated That Dongluocheng Belongs to the Puppet State. The Jimmi Commissioner's Office is Scheduled to be Established Today.

<p>(Tianjin) Shibayama, Yiwo, and Tao Shangming are scheduled to arrive in Tianjin on the 17th to discuss the handover of Yuguan. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military Attaché Shibayama said that Dongluocheng is located outside Yuguan and should belong to Manchuria. Manchurian institutions inside Yuguan are renting office space. There are no suitable houses for relocation outside Yuguan for the time being, and construction has not yet begun. After China takes over Yuguan, they will absolutely not interfere with your country's local administration. The Yuguan Local Merchants' Maintenance Association will be abolished, and the two stationed Japanese army squadrons, totaling more than 300 men, can also be withdrawn outside the pass.

<p>(Beiping) Yiwo, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency stationed in Yuguan, recently suddenly sent his representative, Kofuku Yoshinori, to Luanxian to establish a large-scale Japanese language research institute and established support associations in Tangshan, Kaiping, Changli, Majiagou, and other places to recruit local ruffians and local bullies and entice villagers from these areas to join the association. They distributed leaflets claiming that all scholars, farmers, merchants, officials, and civilians, if they joined the association one day earlier, could get one day's protection earlier; otherwise, they would inevitably suffer a tragic fate in the future. After joining the association, they also issued badges, house numbers, and other items. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of taking over Yuguan is still awaiting negotiation. Yiwo is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin tomorrow night to prepare to negotiate with our side. Tao Shangming said that Yiwo is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin tomorrow night. Because I still have official duties to handle here, it is undecided whether I can go to Tianjin. If I do not go, Yiwo may come to Beiping to discuss everything in the future. The takeover of Yuguan is generally not a problem. The Jimmi Commissioner's Office is scheduled to be established on the 17th. Yin Rugeng will go to Tongxian at that time to attend the inauguration ceremony and is scheduled to convene a meeting of the magistrates of the ten counties under his jurisdiction on the 21st.

According to Huang, the Inner Mongolian request for autonomy was not a serious issue, but the Chinese and foreign newspapers exaggerated it, causing surprise among people from all walks of life. The central government has always adhered to a policy of assisting the various ethnic groups in Baonei and will naturally do its best to assist the Mongolians' request for autonomy. I entered Mongolia to comfort them and had several consultations with the princes, explaining in detail the central government's intentions toward Mongolia. Most of the princes understood, so a general agreement was reached with De Wang and others to allow Inner Mongolia to set up two autonomous regions in Chahar and Suiyuan, but the detailed methods must be submitted to the central government for decision. The Mongolian land is fertile, but in the past, attention was not paid to development, and the culture is backward, and the people's level of knowledge is relatively low. Now, the majority of Mongolians have very good feelings toward the central government. On the way back, I met Yan in Shanxi, and Yan was very concerned about the central government. When I passed Jinan, I met Han and felt that the local administration in Shandong had been put on the right track. When the car stopped in Tai'an, I did not meet Feng. After arriving in the capital, I will report to the central government in detail. The date of entering Jiangxi is undecided. According to Huang's secretary, Zhong Shuren, the comforting mission to Mongolia held talks with the princes of Inner Mongolia in Bailingmiao on November 17. De Wang and others, after Huang's persuasion, all understood the central government's kindness in caring for the Mongolians. Inner Mongolia is severely cold, and the climate is not suitable, so everyone who went to Mongolia looked very haggard. Dong Nan also said that he accompanied Huang to the capital to report to the central government on the recent military and political situation in North China. There are more than 100,000 troops in North China. Since the central government reduced the monthly military pay to four million, the military pay is even more stretched. After arriving in the capital, a detailed discussion will be held with key figures in the central government. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Wang Jialie's Troops Recovered the Counties in Eastern Guizhou</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Guizhou Provincial Government's representative in the capital said that Wang Jialie has ordered Bai Huizhang to lead four regiments to be stationed in Biaoxi County in Eastern Guizhou, besieging the troops of Che Mingyi, Yang Qichang, and Lei Mingjiu in the direction of Tongren. Recently, You Guocai led thousands of troops to occupy the Panjiang area of Western Guizhou, proclaiming himself the commander of the 25th Army. In order to strictly prevent You's troops in Western Guizhou from invading the east, Wang Jialie shortened the defensive areas of the troops in Eastern Guizhou and abandoned several counties in Tongren and Sinan. Unexpectedly, Che Mingyi and others led their troops to occupy Tongren and Sinan and continued to invade. Therefore, Wang ordered Bai Huizhang to lead his troops to counterattack and recover the counties in Eastern Guizhou. Fierce fighting has been taking place near Tongren in recent days. The troops of Che, Yang, and Lei are about to flee to the border of Hunan. As for You Guocai in Western Guizhou, he seems willing to compromise, and the situation has eased.

<h3>Black Yi People Stirring on the Yunnan Border. The Government Cables Orders to Strengthen Precautions.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhongdian in Yunnan Province was previously looted by Yi bandits and then defeated by provincial troops. In order to clarify the truth, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission cabled the counties in Xikang to investigate. According to reports, the Zhongdian looting was carried out by Black Yi people from Chading Township, Daocheng, and other places. The Black Yi people on the Yunnan border are recently attempting to rob again. It is further reported from that area that the Black Yi bandits held a meeting at Sangge Temple, deciding that all able-bodied men, except those over sixty and under ten, must be mobilized to avenge the previous suppression. They also conscripted Dao Yi people to help. The Dao Yi people, fearing their power, declined on the pretext but agreed to help with military expenses. The inside situation is not yet clear. The government has cabled Yunnan Province to strengthen precautions and find ways to eliminate the previous incidents to avoid the expansion of the situation. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Gave a Responsible Talk in the Capital. Negotiations on Through Train Service Were Not Conducted.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, recently issued a written statement to reporters from the Central News Agency, as follows: I came to the capital this time to report on the situation in North China to President Wang and went to Shanghai to report on the railway affairs of the Beining Railway to Minister Gu and request instructions on all matters that should be developed and reformed. The Shanghai Shen Bao's report on the 14th of this month is the most accurate account of my remarks. In summary, there are two main points: (1) The issue of the Beining Railway's through train service out of the pass has not been discussed, and there have been no negotiations recently. (2) Regarding the collection of taxes at the various passes of the Great Wall, the North China authorities are actively carrying it out. The above is my responsible statement. There are many kinds of newspapers in South China, and it is difficult for me to read them all and correct them at any time. Therefore, I cannot be responsible for my remarks published in other newspapers. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>France and the Little Entente Unite to Form an Anti-German Front, Refusing to Abandon the Treaty of Versailles, Rejecting Germany's Demand for Military Armaments, The Disarmament Conference Must Not Be Held Outside of Geneva, Amendments to the League of Nations Covenant Require Unanimous Consent of Member States</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš have completed their discussions on various issues yesterday afternoon. The conclusion reached is that Italy's views on the League of Nations and Germany's demand for equality in armaments should be resolved within the scope of the League of Nations and in accordance with the rules stipulated in the Covenant of the League of Nations. The reason is that the Little Entente countries believe that Italy's plan is to allow major powers to begin discussions to revise the territorial clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, which is resolutely opposed by the Little Entente countries. On the other hand, all these countries oppose the conclusion of a disarmament convention outside of Geneva, because Germany's intention is to prevent the disarmament issue from being resolved in Geneva and to engage in the revision of the Treaty of Versailles outside of the rules stipulated in the Covenant of the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, the country's ambassador to France Osuský, and French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour met, and French Foreign Ministry Political Affairs Assistant Massigli was also present. The talks lasted from 5:45 PM to 7:15 PM. Beneš told reporters upon leaving: (The League of Nations issue and the League of Nations reorganization plan began to be studied yesterday, and I continued to discuss it with Paul-Boncour today. The disarmament issue has been studied completely, and the issues of Central Europe and the Balkans have also begun to be studied. Tomorrow, President Lebrun will invite me to lunch, and all kinds of issues related to the previous events will be discussed again at that time. Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour and I will report more news to you tomorrow), and so on. (Havas News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>New Crystallization of French Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>No Separate Negotiations with Germany (Paris) According to the Workers' Daily, French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour is currently holding talks in Paris with Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, the rapporteur for the Disarmament Conference. The result seems to be a new crystallization of French diplomatic policy. The new French policy is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) No separate talks with Germany. (2) Germany must not restore its armaments, at least not as currently proposed. (3) The Disarmament Conference must not be held outside of Geneva, but France and the Little Entente are prepared to discuss disarmament with Germany in Geneva on January 21 next year. (4) The Covenant of the League of Nations can only be amended by a unanimous vote.</p>
<p>Seeking Unity with Sympathetic Countries The newspaper also stated that, in view of the atmosphere of panic created by German diplomatic policy, French Prime Minister Chautemps has held important discussions with Minister of War Daladier, Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, and Herriot. It is rumored that it has been decided to adopt a very resolute attitude towards Germany together with countries sympathetic to France.</p>
<p>French-Russian Rapprochement Under Consideration There is also one matter that is extremely relevant to this. Soviet Russia recently invited Paul-Boncour to visit Moscow, intending to establish French-Russian friendship. This matter has been under consideration for several months but has not been actively pursued, for fear of creating an atmosphere of panic of Germany being encircled. There is another reason why France and Russia have not yet approached each other, namely, the Far Eastern situation, especially the situation in Vietnam, because there is fear that if a war breaks out between Japan and Russia one day, France's pro-Russian attitude may have an impact that is detrimental to its interests in the Far East.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Capable of Fighting on Two Fronts Soviet Russia is confident that it is capable of preparing for war on both the eastern and western fronts at the same time, and French aviation official Goutte has a deep impression of the strength of the Soviet Air Force. It is rumored that he once told the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies that the strength of the Soviet Air Force is enough to make Japanese Minister of War Araki hesitate and consider.

It is insufficient for Britain to rely solely on unilateral action to seek a path to disarmament. Other countries with opposing views must be persuaded to understand in order to achieve coordination. In order to overcome these difficulties, Britain is determined not to avoid hard work. In conclusion, he expressed that the British government still believes in the League of Nations. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain also expressed the same view in a speech in Halifax, stating that the obstacle to the future of disarmament lies not in the people's desire for war, but in the fear of aggression. Therefore, it is imperative to exhaust all kinds of attempts to establish such a system of security, because only by obtaining security can other countries be able to reduce their armaments according to the standards of our country.

<h3>Simon's Preparations Before Going Abroad</h3>
<p>(London) Before departing for France, Italy, and other places for recreation, Foreign Secretary Simon intends to familiarize himself with the situation in Europe. Today, he had a long talk with British Ambassador to Germany Phipps, who was summoned back to the country. Phipps then attended a meeting of the Cabinet Disarmament Committee and reported on the current situation in Germany. It is rumored that Phipps said that German Chancellor Hitler aspires to peace but advocates equality in armaments and is unwilling to allow Germany to remain a third-rate country. When Simon goes to Paris next week, he will inform France that it must make concessions on Germany's demand to restore its armaments, otherwise it should allow itself to implement disarmament. In view of Phipps' report, this view is indeed credible. The news that Simon will visit Italy during Christmas has reportedly caused great satisfaction in Rome. Simon will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome on his way back to the country via Capri. As for Simon's visit to Italy, there has been no formal contact between the two sides. It is now believed that disarmament will be discussed, seeking to promote amity between France and Germany, and the Italian Prime Minister's proposals for reforming the League of Nations.

<p>(Paris) (Echo de Paris) reported that the Soviet Russian government has invited Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour to visit Moscow after touring Poland and Czechoslovakia. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Demands to France</h3>
<p>(London) (Daily News) reported that the British Ambassador to Germany Phipps has submitted a report to the Cabinet Subcommittee on Disarmament Issues. According to the report, the proposals recently submitted by the German government to France are as follows:</p>
<h3>Security Guarantees</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of security, German Chancellor Hitler intends to combine the two opinions of British Prime Minister MacDonald, namely (1) a ten-year political truce and an agreement not to use violence, and (2) the signing of numerous non-aggression treaties. Germany is prepared to take three actions in this regard, namely (1) signing non-aggression treaties with all neighboring countries, (2) recognizing the principle of sanctioning aggression, and (3) excluding ideas that encourage war from textbooks and public schools.</p>
<h3>Equality of Armaments</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of disarmament, Germany demands that equality of armaments be implemented on the following three bases: (1) The German National Defense Force should switch to a short-term conscription system, and its strength should be increased to 300,000 men. (2) After the reorganization of the army, it should be allowed to install all defensive weapons, namely (a) 150-millimeter caliber artillery positions, (b) assault vehicles, (c) light reconnaissance aircraft. Other countries shall agree to abolish all heavy weapons within a short period of time, and bomber aircraft and chemical and bacterial warfare shall also be prohibited. (3) Germany acknowledges the existence of a timed and automatic armaments inspection system, but on the condition that all countries are subject to the same inspection. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Rearmament Threatened by French Reaction</h3>
<p>(London) (The Times) published two dispatches from its Paris correspondent, explaining the reasons for the French's anxiety about the peace issue. The first dispatch describes Germany's rearmament situation, and the information collected in it is quite rich. Although the British authorities are trying to avoid raising this issue directly, British public opinion is moved after reading this article. The article stated that Germany's actions are all in violation of current treaties. Germany's initial reorganization of the General Staff already violated the Treaty of Versailles. German infantry companies, which used to have only six rows, now have nine rows, and each battalion also has a row dedicated to resisting tanks. Furthermore, there are as many as 163 to 243 automatic weapons per division. Trench mortars, which are prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles, have now been added. The cavalry and artillery have also undergone the same reorganization. Various armies have been extensively motorized. The number of National Defense Forces personnel who can immediately enlist upon receiving orders reaches 165,000 people. In addition, there are 100,000 soldiers who have already completed their training, and 80,000 police and political armed forces that can be conscripted. The total military strength should be 345,000 people. Adding former veterans and those serving in forced labor camps, the number should be 1.3 million. As for Germany's military industry and military aviation industry, they have also been greatly expanded. The increased import of various essential military raw materials is clear evidence of this. The second dispatch from the correspondent describes France's armaments, stating that France currently has 428,000 army personnel, but this will be reduced to 370,000 by 1936. Therefore, it is inappropriate to consider the French army as the key to maintaining peace. The French often say that the key to peace lies in the attitude of Britain, which is true, because only by the two countries of Britain and France being sincerely united can the aggression of other countries be prevented.

<h3>British Navy Emphasizes Far East Defense, Fleet Commander to Meet in Singapore</h3>
<p>(London) The British Admiralty announced that the next regular meeting of the commander of the British Far East Fleet will be held in Singapore in January. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The Morning Post stated in its editorial today that it is important to hold a naval conference to discuss the naval status of the Far East because the insufficient defense of Australia and New Zealand and the incompleteness of the Singapore naval base are now gradually being understood. According to the current port construction speed, the Singapore naval port cannot be completed until 1939. The cost is a total of 7 million pounds, and there is still 2.75 million pounds of construction that has not been carried out. Malaya, New Zealand, and Hong Kong jointly contributed 3.25 million pounds, and the site of the naval port itself was donated by the Sultan of Johor. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Russo-Italian Pact Takes Effect</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov and Italian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Attolico exchanged the ratification documents for the Treaty of Friendship, Non-Aggression, and Neutrality. The treaty was concluded in Rome in September of this year and came into effect today. (Havas News Agency, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Discovery: Foreigners Secretly Photograph Fortresses</h3>
<p>Kyoto dispatch: A certain foreigner, Burstol, recently stayed at a certain hotel in front of Kyoto Station. He is now suspected of violating the Fortress Zone Law and has been taken back to the Seventh Police Station for investigation. As a result of the investigation, it was discovered that he landed in Kobe in mid-October. Under the pretext of studying ancient architecture, he traveled to various places. During this time, he photographed the Yokosuka fortress zone and carried a large number of original plates. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the United States Formally Appointed: Saito Hiroshi to Succeed</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After Foreign Minister Hirota and Prime Minister Saito discussed the matter this afternoon, they decided to appoint Japanese Ambassador to the Netherlands Saito Hiroshi as Ambassador to the United States. The position of Japanese Ambassador to the United States is the most important position in Japanese diplomacy. It was rumored that Viscount Ishii or Matsuoka Yosuke would be appointed, but both declined firmly. Therefore, Saito Hiroshi was promoted to succeed them. There are four reasons for this: (1) The United States hopes that a Japanese ambassador representing the views of the Japanese military will succeed. (2) Saito Hiroshi has always advocated a tough diplomacy and is a veteran of the hardline faction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (3) He was recommended by the young officers of the military. (4) Foreign Minister Hirota appreciates his diplomatic skills. Saito Hiroshi has a reputation as a tough guy within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is as famous as former Information Director Shiratori and Asian Affairs Bureau Director Tani. He belongs to the military faction within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Chinese League News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota has decided to promote Envoy to the Netherlands Saito Hiroshi to Ambassador to the United States and will appoint New York Consul General Horiuchi Kensuke as the Director of the newly established Research Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Saito is from Niigata Prefecture and is forty-eight years old this year. This promotion is truly extraordinary. However, this wise decision to promote newcomers can revitalize the atmosphere of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, there is praise for Foreign Minister Hirota's wise decision to appoint newcomers. Saito's proficiency in English is known at home and abroad. During the London Disarmament Conference, he assisted Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki and played the role of Secretary-General. As this promising new ambassador, how he will open up the atmosphere between Japan and the United States after taking office as Ambassador to the United States is highly anticipated by all parties.

<h3>Soviet Ambassador to Japan Hosts Hirota Koki, Exchange of Views on Japanese-Russian Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev hosted Foreign Minister Hirota, Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the European and American Affairs Bureau Togo, and Information Director Amau at a dinner party at 7:00 PM on the 15th. They exchanged views on Japanese-Russian issues and the meeting ended at 12:30 AM. (Japanese United News, 16th) (Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, who was invited to a regular social gathering at the Soviet Embassy in Japan on the 14th, will hold free talks with Ambassador Yurenev regarding the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway in preparation for opening up relations with Russia. Ambassador Yurenev is scheduled to host Prime Minister Saito, Chairman of the Japanese-Russian Association, on the 21st to have sincere talks on removing disputes that are hindering the progress of Japanese-Russian relations. Such coordination between Japan and Russia centered on the Russian ambassador is expected to contribute greatly to the negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which are in a state of stagnation, and the negotiations on Russian fisheries rights in the spring of next year. (Dentsu News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Snow and Cold Threaten Europe and America</h3>
<p>(New York) The climate is extremely cold throughout the United States. According to today's news, several more people have frozen to death. Temperatures in the New England states are all below zero. The temperature in Fairfield, Maine this morning dropped to minus forty-four degrees. New York City is covered in snow, and traffic is stagnant. The authorities have hired 10,000 unemployed people to clear the snow. According to news from Europe, Italy has also been very cold recently, with heavy snow and strong winds, causing many shipwrecks off the coast. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Will Russia and Japan Really Go to War? The Japanese Have Already Seized the Management Rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Russian Troops Concentrated on the Border According to London</h3>
<p>(London) The increasingly deteriorating relations between Russia and Japan have aroused anxiety among the general public. The Moscow authorities are very angry because (Manchukuo) has arbitrarily appointed a director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, taking precedence over Russian director Rudy, and interfering with the Russian railway management rights. At the same time, negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway have completely stalled, and both sides are trying to block each other's trade on the railway. Soviet Russia has now issued an important order to provide preferential treatment to farmers in the Amur and Primorsky provinces and increase the monthly salaries of the Far East Army, and it is openly stated that this is for the purpose of strengthening defense. London believes that Russia has 250,000 troops stationed on the Amur border, as well as 450 aircraft in Vladivostok and Shuangchengpu, including 40 heavy bombers. It is said that Russia's conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with Poland and its efforts to seek friendship with France are enough to allow it to act freely in the Far East. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Takahashi Advocates Implementing Retaliatory Tariffs to Cope with the World's Markets</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The trade wars and tariff wars between countries around the world are becoming increasingly fierce. In order to cope with this commercial war, the Japanese government is studying the theory of retaliatory tariffs by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is considering trade management proposals, and the Ministry of Finance, which is in charge of tariff control, also recognizes its necessity. Finance Minister Takahashi expressed his views on the 15th, strongly advocating the necessity of establishing countermeasures such as retaliatory tariffs and trade management. That is, Finance Minister Tan said, "Today, the trade relations between countries are dangerous. Japan should resist with appropriate weapons. The retaliatory tariff plan is a necessary weapon for this. The enactment of laws to manage exchange rates was thought at the time that the laws could manage trade, but in fact this is not the case. Tariff wars can be dealt with by retaliatory tariff wars, but under various circumstances, tariffs alone are not a sufficient method. It is also possible to implement import bans when necessary. The future of trade is unpredictable. In order to deal with future situations, the government intends to submit a bill to the parliament to obtain the authority to deal with various opportunities." (Japanese United News, 16th) (Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided on a policy. After the Japanese-Indian negotiations are completed to resolve the problem of the oppression of Japanese goods around the world, it has ordered a special committee of the Trade Deliberation Council to make preparations. The means are to set up commercial officers in Batavia to serve as an intermediary organization for trade between the Union of South Africa and Japan. At the same time, exchange ministers or representatives from both sides to resolve various issues, and exchange envoys with India and Australia to maintain Japanese commercial rights. (Japanese United News, 16th)</p>
<h3>Germany Also Advocates Rejecting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Japanese Ambassador to Germany Nagai to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the impact of Japanese goods, which are like a flood everywhere in the world, is not direct in Germany, but recently there has been a kind of discussion, which even uses the words "yellow peril." The reason for the entry and exit of Japanese goods is that the European countries are all engrossed in political struggles. If common defense measures are not taken decisively at this time, it is feared that the time of the complete annihilation of Europe will arrive. Therefore, those who are engaged in Japanese goods in Germany have been discussing countermeasures and all believe that the Japanese government should take the following measures: (1) Conclude agreements with various countries individually. (2) For countries with no treaties or discriminatory treatment, seek appropriate means in terms of tariffs. (3) When establishing export associations, formulate regulations that are stronger than compulsory enterprise alliances. (4) The government and the people should jointly establish appropriate systems. (5) Stop imitating trademarks. (6) While Japan's economy is developing, it is also in the interest of raw material countries. The advanced countries should be explained its meaning in opening up new markets.

<h3>Former US Ambassador to Cuba Welles Becomes Deputy Secretary</h3>
<p>(Washington) After former US Ambassador to Cuba Welles was swapped with former Assistant Secretary of State Caffery, Welles assumed his new position as Assistant Secretary of State today. According to the order for the exchange of the two, it was announced several months ago. Later, due to the revolution in Cuba, Welles remained in office until now. Recently, because the United States refused to recognize the Cuban government of San Martin, the Cuban people resented Welles, so the exchange was implemented. (National News Agency, 15th)</p>
<h3>US Diplomacy Toward Latin America Changes to a Liberal Policy Respecting the Absolute Integrity of Each Country's Independence: Important Statement by Hull at the Pan-American Conference, Peaceful Resolution of the Chaco War Expected, Bolivia Loses Territory in National Mourning, German Commander-in-Chief Resigns</h3>
<p>Two major announcements were made at today's Pan-American Conference in Montevideo: one was the US declaration of adopting a new open and liberal policy in diplomacy, and the other was that the peaceful resolution of the Chaco War was greatly hopeful. It is hereby learned that after Bolivia accepted the settlement method of referring all disputes to arbitration as proposed by the League of Nations Commission, it immediately passed a resolution applying for a cessation of hostilities between the two countries of Bolivia and Paraguay and guaranteeing that the American countries would cooperate with the League of Nations to restore peace.

<p>While 50,000 Cuban people were marching in the streets of Havana to show the United States that President San Martin was deeply supported by the people, US Secretary of State Hull also declared at the Pan-American Conference here that the United States is willing to sign the Pan-American Non-Aggression Pact proposed by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru several weeks ago and guarantee that the US government upholds the (absolute integrity of each country's independence), stating that the United States is determined to fully implement its new policy of (open liberalism). (National News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>The Bolivian government officially announced in La Paz today that it has approved the resignation of General Kundt as Commander-in-Chief of the Bolivian Army and appointed General Peñaranda as his successor. General Kundt was hired in 1910 to train the Bolivian Army and returned to his country in 1914 to participate in the war. After the European War, because the Treaty of Versailles did not allow Germans to train the armies of other countries, he became a citizen of Bolivia and continued to train the Bolivian army. He was expelled during the 1930 revolution, but was recalled when the Chaco War broke out to command the entire army. Now, due to the great defeat, he has resigned and also resigned from his position at the military academy. The Bolivian army under the new commander Peñaranda now consists of six divisions, including twelve infantry regiments, six cavalry regiments, one field artillery regiment, six engineering battalions, and twenty aircraft.

<h3>Narcotic Drugs: Japan Has an Unusually High Demand, Accounting for More Than 50% of the World's Total - Report Released by the International Supervisory Authority -</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Supervisory Body on Narcotic Drugs of the League of Nations released a report stating that the total amount of morphine, cocaine, and heroin required for legal use worldwide in 1934 was approximately 47 tons. This amount is larger than expected, because the harmless substances that can be extracted from morphine and heroin have increased compared to before. However, the amount of heroin requested by Japan, Korea, and Taiwan accounts for more than half of the world's total demand, which inevitably surprises people in the League of Nations. Morphine has the greatest demand within the total amount of 47 tons worldwide, accounting for 40 tons. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Troubles in Spain are Suppressed, The Cabinet Resigns En Masse, The Right Wing Takes Over and Controls the Government, Whether the Political Situation Can Be Stabilized is Still Difficult to Say</h3>
<p>With the anarchist terrorist actions in the provinces of Catalonia and Zaragoza having been quelled in Madrid for a week, the Spanish Barrio cabinet resigned en masse today. After President Zamora accepted the resignations, he immediately contacted the leaders of the right wing, which won a great victory in the current general election, to form a cabinet. Observers of the political situation here regard the resignation of the Barrio cabinet as a procedure that should have been followed after the right wing's victory in the general election and has nothing to do with the anarchist riots. As for the riots this time, they were only a reaction of the extreme left wing after the extreme right wing's victory. Therefore, Barrio decided to hand over power to the succeeding cabinet after quelling the riots. Although the Spanish political situation has now swung to the right, it is still in an uncertain state, because there are more than forty political parties in the parliament, and the future changes in their alliances are difficult to predict.

<h3>British House of Commons: Session Runs Day and Night; Members Unable to Endure Long Sitting, Witty Remarks Abound</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons convened at 2:45 p.m. on Thursday and adjourned at 1:30 p.m. today (Friday), the longest session since the European War. Much of the time was spent debating the financial resolutions of the Newfoundland Bill. The Labour Party strongly opposed the bill's suggestion of insatiable demands on British taxpayers, and the debate continued until 8:30 a.m. Around 10 a.m., members who had gone home to sleep began returning to the House, and they proceeded to discuss the second item on Thursday's agenda, the Unemployment Bill. Five female members sat up all night. After noon, many members showed signs of fatigue, and witty remarks arose from all sides. For example, Socialist member Bevan brandished his fist and said, "Mr. Thomas, your brain must be muddled." Labour member Kirkwood said, "Mr. Thomas is very tired. He bears a great responsibility. Even when his health is good, he has almost lost two dominions. If he is further exhausted, the other four dominions will be completely lost." Because Thursday's session extended to today, today's agenda was naturally cancelled. (Reuter, 15th)</p>

<h3>Taking Over Shanhaiguan Actively Underway; Both Sides to Continue Negotiations on Details; Complete Takeover Expected by Year-End</h3>
<p>The issue of reopening the Beining Railway urgently needs resolution. According to communications from Beiping, regarding the matter of taking over Shanhaiguan, personnel were previously sent to Shanhaiguan to negotiate the takeover procedures with Japanese representatives. However, due to the Japanese side creating additional obstacles, the takeover could not be completed as scheduled. Recent back-and-forth consultations have resulted in some progress. After the Shanhaiguan meeting, Igi, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, once came to Beiping to meet with He and Huang to discuss the matter. At that time, it was agreed that Igi would be responsible for specifying the date of return and the takeover procedures and notifying the Chinese side to implement the takeover. Igi then exchanged telegrams with the Kwantung Army. At the same time, Tao Shangming, the representative responsible for the Chinese side, was consulting with Huang Fu and Yu Xuezhong in both Beiping and Tianjin, seeking instructions and exchanging views with Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, and Umezu, the commander of the Japanese North China Garrison Army. The day before yesterday, Tao met with Umezu in Tianjin and agreed to telegraph Igi, inviting him to Tianjin for another meeting to discuss the details of the takeover. Tao came to Beiping this afternoon (14th) to meet with He and Huang, seeking instructions, and at 3 p.m., accompanied by Yuan Tai, the newly appointed magistrate of Linyu County, visited Shibayama at the Japanese Embassy to discuss everything. Shibayama telegraphed Igi, asking him to come to Tianjin immediately to meet with Tao and others. Tao plans to go to Tianjin tomorrow evening (15th) with Yuan Tai to wait for Igi. If Igi can arrive in Tianjin in the next few days, the takeover details will be discussed in Tianjin. The representatives of both sides are Tao Shangming, Yuan Tai, Umezu, and Igi. If necessary, Yu Xuezhong and Shibayama will also participate. In case Igi does not have time to come to Tianjin, Yuan Tai will first have a diplomatic meeting with Umezu in Tianjin and then rush to Haiyangzhen before the 20th to take over his post, so as not to miss the deadline set by the provincial government. Tao Shangming will then go to Shanhaiguan to negotiate the detailed takeover procedures with Igi, with the aim of completing the takeover by the end of the year. Regarding the East Luocheng walled city, where negotiations have been obstructed, both sides are avoiding formal negotiations. Currently, the Japanese barracks in that area are mostly completed, and the market has also been planned. In fact, there is no hope of returning it. The opinions of both sides on the other minor issues are generally close and do not pose a major problem. The Chinese negotiators hope that Igi will arrive in Tianjin immediately to fully agree on all procedures, so that the Linyu County government can move to Yucheng, allowing the newly appointed County Magistrate Yuan Tai to go directly to Shanhaiguan to take office. Yuan graduated from the Zhejiang Military Academy in the late Qing Dynasty and studied in Japan. He has a classmate relationship with Huang Fu, is very experienced, and is also capable. It may be more appropriate to have him deal with this difficult situation.</p>
<p>The issue of reopening the Beining Railway, which is related to the takeover of Shanhaiguan, also urgently needs to be resolved. During the previous visit to Beiping by Okamura, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, to negotiate the resolution of various issues in the war zone, the issues of taking over the various passes of the Great Wall and reopening the railway were discussed at the same time. The reopening of the railway is not only related to the revenue of the Beining Railway, but the Japanese side also believes that it has a great impact on its interests and hopes to resolve it at the same time as the takeover of Shanhaiguan. Since the Beining Railway Bureau drafted a plan and submitted it to the Ministry of Railways for approval, the Ministry of Railways has taken a cautious attitude and has not yet sent a reply to Beiping. The director of the railway bureau, Yin Tong, believes that this matter has been pending for a long time, causing many inconveniences, so he went to Nanjing in person the day before yesterday to negotiate, intending to urge its early resolution and is currently negotiating with the central government.</p>
<p>According to Tao Shangming's conversation with reporters this morning, the takeover of Shanhaiguan is generally not a problem. Both sides have agreed on all principles, and only the time and procedures need to be negotiated. Igi, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, has recently exchanged telegrams with the Kwantung Army and has probably received a reply. The takeover is expected to be implemented by the end of the year. I came to Beiping today to meet with Chairman Huang to make a concrete formulation of our intentions and will go to Tianjin in the next few days to meet with the Japanese representative Igi to discuss everything. The Japanese side has not formally raised the issue of East Luocheng. The Japanese barracks and market in that area are mostly completed and are still under construction. The provincial government is considering the issue of the Shanhaiguan Special Public Security Bureau in order to save expenses. The puppet Linyu Local Maintenance Association will naturally be abolished. The disposal of its personnel will depend on future circumstances. (14th December)</p>
<h3>Arita's Goodwill Visit to Beiping = Actually Says Misunderstandings Between China and Japan Lie in the Three Eastern Provinces = = And Claims Sino-Japanese Friendship Can Be Easily Achieved =</h3>

At 3:30 p.m., he went to Jurentang to visit He Yingqin, and at 4 p.m., he went to the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee to visit Huang Fu. Huang had sent representative Tao Shangming to the Japanese Embassy in advance to express greetings, and they arranged to hold a banquet at the Foreign Affairs Building tomorrow evening (15th). According to Arita's account of his visit to Beiping, he said that this trip to China was purely for travel. He first took a ship from Japan to Dalian, and then went to Changchun, Jilin, Harbin, Fengtian, Jinzhou, Chifeng, and Chengde. Today (14th) at 1:40 p.m., he took a plane to Beiping. Because both the Northeast and North China are places he had visited before, he made a special trip to China before going to Belgium. He came here specifically to meet Huang (Fu), the chairman of the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee, who is an old friend of his, and He (Yingqin), the acting chairman, whom he had long admired. Mayor Yuan Liang of Beiping, whom he had known for twenty years, when he was Consul General in Fengtian and Yuan was a Counselor in the Bureau of Foreign Affairs, got along very well, and he planned to take this opportunity to revisit old friends. He plans to stay in Beiping for two days and then return to his country by ship from Tianjin. Due to time constraints, he will not go to Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. However, he has just arrived in Beiping and has not yet met with political and military leaders, so he has no comments to make. But he saw that the road from Nanyuan to the Japanese Embassy was still as prosperous as before. Sino-Japanese diplomatic problems are actually very simple. China and Japan are the two major countries in East Asia. If we want to seek peace in East Asia, we must first strive for Sino-Japanese friendship. The reason why misunderstandings occurred between China and Japan in the past was that the root of the trouble was in the Three Eastern Provinces. After the September 18th Incident, the problem of the Three Eastern Provinces, which was the root of the trouble for peace between China and Japan, has been eliminated. It is like a patient having a boil cut off. Although the root of the boil has been removed, the remaining pain cannot be eliminated immediately. After a considerable period of time, the poison of the boil will dissipate, and the patient will recover. Therefore, I believe that the problem of Sino-Japanese friendship can be easily achieved, and now that the root of the trouble has been removed, if you understand this principle, you will know that East Asian peace must have long-term guarantees; otherwise, East Asia will never have peace. There are many misunderstandings abroad about Japanese-Russian diplomacy, and they even claim that it is extremely tense. This is said by those who do not understand the truth. It is a fact that the Soviet Union is increasing troops to the border, because at that time, the negotiations on the Middle East Railway broke down once, but now it has been resolved. Since Russia has no need to use troops, it will inevitably gradually retreat. This matter is similar to the situation of the United States increasing troops to the Pacific. It has now begun to withdraw.) Arita's remarks are worthy of attention. (14th)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Holds Rally to Denounce Fujian Yesterday | Over 100,000 People Participate | | Resolved to Request Central Government to Order Suppression |</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: People from all walks of life in the capital of Zhejiang Province held a rally at the West Lake Public Sports Ground at 1:00 p.m. today (16th) to denounce the Fujian rebels. All agencies, organizations, and schools, large, medium, and small, participated. The aviation school and others also set out in full force, with a total of over 100,000 people. Boy Scouts maintained order inside the venue, and the Aviation Administration sent an anti-aircraft gun team to guard with anti-aircraft guns. In the air, six aircraft from the aviation school circled back and forth, providing cover at high altitude and distributing various anti-rebel leaflets. Military police were stationed in sections around the venue, so although the number of participants was large, the order was good. The meeting elected Fang Qingru, Xu Peigen, Jiang Jianren, Wang Zhengying, Zhao Zhiyou, and Chen Bulei as the presidium. After the music started and salutes were performed, Fang Qingru, the chairman of the meeting, reported the significance of holding the rally to denounce the rebels. Then, Wang Zhengying of the provincial government, Pei Gen of the Aviation Administration, Chen Bulei of the Education Department, Jiang Jianren of the Aviation School, Chen Wen of the Municipal Party Department, Zhao Zhiyou of the Municipal Government, Tu Da of the Student Union, Zhu Huiji of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Tong Mengsheng of the Municipal Farmers Association delivered speeches in succession.

After the proposals were passed, they marched in a parade through the city and dispersed at 4:00 p.m. (16th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Orders Seven Provinces to Strictly Prohibit Planting of Tobacco Seedlings - Officers and Soldiers Protecting Them to be Punished by Military Law -</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang yesterday telegraphed the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, the Pacification Commissioner's Offices of Henan and Hubei, and the military commanders stationed in the seven provinces, reiterating the ban on planting tobacco seedlings. The telegram said: (It has been found that the central provinces have absolutely prohibited the planting of opium, and measures for investigating and prohibiting the planting of opium were drafted last year and submitted to the National Government for approval, and telegrams were issued to comply with them. Personnel were dispatched in the spring of this year to investigate and prohibit them, and in September, telegrams were issued to strictly prohibit them. Now that winter is approaching, it is the time to sow tobacco seedlings, and lawless people and a few local bullies may inevitably try to do so, clinging to their old habits, instigating ignorant people, and violating the ban. If the investigation and prohibition are slightly lax, the poisonous weeds will have a resurgence. I hereby reiterate the strict prohibition, instructing all military and political commanders to strictly order their subordinates to be responsible for the investigation and prohibition, so that all the jurisdictions must be completely eradicated, and no more seeds should enter the ground and no more seedlings should come out of the soil. In remote areas, if there are any cases of resisting orders and secretly planting, the military and political commanders of the respective jurisdictions should supervise the investigation and eradication, and the planters should be arrested and punished to the fullest extent of the law, without any leniency. If any unscrupulous officers and soldiers or local bullies take the opportunity to collude and protect them, they will be punished by military law as soon as they are discovered. After this ban, if tobacco seedlings are found in any of the jurisdictions, the respective military and political commanders will be held accountable. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued to comply with and forward it to all subordinates to abide by and report the handling of the matter. This order.) (15th)</p>
<h3>The Financial Crisis in Shantou Over the Past Year = The Course of Three Total Collapses = = The Chamber of Commerce Still Tries to Maintain It =</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The warning of the total financial collapse of Chao-Shan was seen last winter, but the various silver firms could still try their best to support it. Until this spring, remittances from Southeast Asia were sharply reduced, and rural areas were bankrupted by the pressure of taxes. Under the double impact, business became more and more sluggish, and each item on the market was taxed several times, with taxes exceeding the cost. In addition, the cash circulating in the market was continuously absorbed by the authorities year after year. As a result, Shantou became a world of paper money, and the paper money was printed by commercial silver firms. This spring, the amount of cash was sharply reduced, and the amount of paper money gradually decreased due to the closure or withdrawal of various silver firms. As a result, the market fluctuated. The first collapse occurred after Qingming and before the Dragon Boat Festival. Dozens of large shops and silver firms closed down at the same time, owing more than 2 million yuan in front debts. At that time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Silver Exchange Association, and others tried their best to maintain it, and agreed on joint guarantee measures, issued industrial guarantee white notes, used them in the market, set interest rates, restricted withdrawals, and prohibited silver exports. The market was slightly stabilized for a while, but there was no fundamental solution. The fundamental solution lies in the government reducing taxes to relieve the people's difficulties. May I ask, how can we rely on paper money to save paper money for a long time? Therefore, around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the white notes expired and could not be cashed. Merchants were very suspicious of them, and the credit of silver firms plummeted. The second wave of total collapse followed. Chen Yuanda, Cheng Mao, Bao Sheng, and other major silver firms, which were the backbone of the Chaozhou gang silver firms, were once again swept into the abyss by the evil waves, owing about 2 million yuan in front debts. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce struggled to take on the responsibility of clearing debts again. This wave gradually subsided. Unexpectedly, as the end of the solar year approached, the silver firms unfortunately experienced a third total collapse. The first to bear the brunt were Guangfa, Zhifa, and Hongfa, the three companies of the Chenghai silver firm, all opened by the Gao family, a wealthy merchant in Chenghai, owing a total of more than 1 million yuan in front debts. As a result, the Jiafa and other silver firms collapsed. On the 8th, Qianxingchang and Guangchengchang on Yongtai Street followed. These two firms were opened by Xiao Huichu, a Raoping native, with Qianxingchang owing more than 700,000 yuan in front debts and Guangchengchang owing more than 200,000 yuan. The reason for their closure was temporary financial difficulties. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce decided to maintain the situation: (1) Because the guaranteed banknotes and white notes of each firm have industrial guarantees, they are stamped with the words "circulate as usual" and are used as usual. They will not be cashed within these four months in order to get through the Lunar New Year; (2) Regardless of which industry or silver firm, all due bills from the 8th will be transferred for 60 days, with an interest rate of 2.5% for silver firms and 3% for other industries. Those who violate this will be punished by the government and fined 500 yuan; (3) Customers with deposit accounts can only withdraw one-tenth of the deposit amount each month. Other industries and silver firms still trade with each other as usual. The credit of Shantou's silver firm banknotes has been sharply reduced, and the post office and the Bank of China have stopped saving money. The post office and tax authorities discriminate against banknotes, so the price of cash exceeds that of banknotes by 50 to 60 yuan per thousand yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate has also risen sharply, with a premium of 235 yuan per thousand yuan. The silver market in the business community is becoming more and more depleted, and the future is very pessimistic. (9th)</p>
<h3>Shandong's Domestically Produced Cigarettes Hit by Increased Taxes - Tobacco Industry Asks Ministry of Finance to Withdraw Order -</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent years, cigarettes have become popular. In Shandong Province alone, 30 million are consumed each year, and the number in the whole country is even more astonishing. Nineteen of these cigarettes are foreign goods. Recently, although some Chinese have engaged in the cigarette industry in an attempt to recover their rights, most are limited by capital and cannot compete with foreign goods. Shandong produces the most tobacco, and the labor is cheap. Cigarettes are manufactured locally at the lowest cost, so the selling price is the lowest, making it the only strong enemy of foreign goods for Chinese tobacco leaves. Three years ago, several cigarette companies in the city manufactured day and night, and demand still exceeded supply. The situation of development can be imagined. Foreign merchants attached great importance to it, but the tax system was changed in 1919, and the tobacco industry was greatly affected. Before 1919, it was divided into seven grades. After 1919, it was divided into three grades. Those above 540 yuan were the first grade, with a tax of 225 yuan. Those above 250 yuan were the second grade, with a tax of 56 yuan. Those below 150 yuan were the third grade, with a tax of 32 yuan (later increased by 7 yuan to 39 yuan). At that time, cigarette factories could still support it. On March 20, it was changed to two grades. Those above 250 yuan were the first grade, with a tax of 110 yuan. Those below 250 yuan were the second grade, with a tax of 55 yuan. For example, cigarettes with a selling price of 90 yuan have a tax of 55 yuan and a cost of 50 yuan. Selling them for 90 yuan is already a loss. Merchants cannot stop operating due to sales reasons and hope that tobacco leaves will fall in price to make a profit. Therefore, they have endured the pain until now. As of now, the tax rate has been increased by another 25 yuan, that is, the previous tax rate of 55 yuan has been increased to 80 yuan, and the tax rate of 110 yuan has been increased to 135 yuan. Foreign cigarettes are expensive, and adding this does not feel painful. However, the small-capitalized, domestically manufactured, mid- and low-grade cigarettes cannot support this sudden increase in tax. The nascent domestically produced cigarette industry is likely to be completely bankrupt. Therefore, the industry association held a meeting today and decided to petition the provincial and municipal governments to request the Ministry of Finance's General Taxation Department to withdraw the order.

<h3>Xuzhou: Paper Money Ready to be Recalled - Assets of Paper Money Merchants Have Been Assessed -</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Regarding the Xuzhou Paper Money Tide, the various sectors have previously jointly discussed and sent representatives with the county magistrate and provincial commissioners to the province to petition, designated banks to replace the recall, seized the assets of the paper money merchants, and County Magistrate She returned to Xuzhou yesterday with the representatives who went to the province. The assessment of the sealed assets has now been determined, and the registration is not yet complete. The measures have not yet been announced, and it is predicted that the future will still be thorny.</p>
<h3>Results of Petition</h3>
<p>She and the representatives did not meet Chairman Chen during this trip to the province, and Secretaries-General Cheng and Commissioners Zhao contacted them separately. The purpose of the representatives' petition was to request the provincial government to designate banks to issue circulating notes to replace the recall of paper money in order to save the current market. Commissioner Zhao said that it was not necessary to issue circulating notes and that it might be inappropriate and harmful, but he clearly stated that the province would definitely take responsibility and use the assets of the paper money merchants as collateral to find a way to recall the paper money on schedule and would never let the people suffer losses. Therefore, She was ordered to quickly register the amount of paper money outstanding and report it to the province, so that the matter could be started immediately. However, the measures have not yet been publicly announced. Perhaps the money bills of the Ping Municipality Bureau will be used to replace them, and the assets can only be used as collateral and cannot be cashed. The provincial government must allocate a portion of cash as preparation to stabilize the situation. This measure will be decided before the solar new year. Because when the various paper money firms suspended redemption on December 2, the county government announced that it would be suspended for one month, and it would be fully redeemed on January 2.</p>
<h3>Property Valuation</h3>
<p>The property of the ticket merchants, except for public taxes related to shareholder transactions and a clear order to fully cash them out, the remaining family property has been valued. (A) Tianbaoyu: (1) Two residential properties, one on Old Daoshu Street and one south of the Electric Light Factory, valued at over 5,330 yuan. (2) One city foundation, located in Hong Temple in the northwest corner, valued at 800 yuan. (3) Three parcels of farmland, one in Wangdian in the Fifth District, one in Poqiao in the Fifth District, and one in Duanzhuang in the First District, valued at 8,100 yuan. The total value of the assets is 14,230 yuan. (B) Burenji: (1) Three residential properties, one in Fushui Well, one in Bazijie, and one south of the Longhai Ticket Office, valued at 21,930 yuan. (2) Two city houses, one on Daoping Road and one on Bazijie, valued at 12,700 yuan. The total value of the assets is 34,630 yuan. (C) Juhechang: (1) One residential property, located in Mahao Town, valued at 1,700 yuan. (2) Three parcels of farmland, one in Yanjia Mountain, one in Dami Temple, and one in Da Wangjia Mountain, valued at 6,000 yuan. The total value of the assets is 7,700 yuan. (D) Shixingchang: (1) Three residential properties, one in Zhou Dong Alley, one in Liang Ban Kang (Wan Hua Yong Pawnshop), and one south of the Prefectural Office (Hong Xing Yong Pawnshop). Except for the Zhou Dong Alley property, which is mortgaged, valued at 2,750 yuan. (2) One city house, located on Si Dao Street (Guang Chun Quan Pawnshop), not valued due to the mortgage. (3) Two parcels of farmland, one in Zhengji and one as county government public land, valued at 9,175 yuan. The total value of the assets is 11,925 yuan. (E) Yizhenxiang: (1) Three city houses, all located on Zhongzheng Street, valued at 12,400 yuan. (F) Chunquan: (1) Two parcels of farmland, one in Yuzhuang and one in Gu Mountain, valued at 40,000 yuan. The asset values of the above six companies are all less than the amount of tickets issued. However, outstanding debts have not been included and may still slightly compensate for the difference.</p>
<h3>Registration of Tickets</h3>
<p>Ticket holders must begin registering their tickets from the 3rd. Originally, the deadline was the 15th, but due to the tight schedule, the county government has extended the deadline by three days to the 18th. However, for remote villages, and a small number of odd tickets, even with an extension, it will be impossible to register all of them. Therefore, although statistics are not yet complete, the actual number of tickets outstanding is predicted to be higher than the number registered. In the future, when cashing out, the registered number cannot be taken as a definite limit. (14th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: A Little Owner of an Oil Mill Crushed His Right Arm</h3>
<p>In the Youbang area outside the Kuatang Bridge outside the West Gate of this city, a certain Liu runs an oil mill, using cottonseed to extract vegetable oil, and the business is doing well. Initially, several oxen were used for work. Recently, sales have gradually increased, and the ox power is limited. So, in the spring, an engine was purchased and machinery was used instead, giving it to his driver. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 AM on the 14th, the driver's young owner saw that the oil on the car was dirty, immediately took a rag to wipe it, and accidentally, the cuff was caught in the belt, crushing his right arm. People nearby saw that the disaster had already happened and quickly stopped the car, but it was too late. The family took the injured person to Shanghai for treatment that day. It is said that his life seems to be safe, but his limbs will definitely be disabled.</p>
<h3>Taicang: Tiger Li Jing Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Recently, in the four townships of this county, bandits have become increasingly rampant, and cases of villagers being robbed and looted are often heard. At the home of farmer Li Yaocheng in Huli Jing in the north of Shuangfeng Township, there suddenly came more than ten bandits around 11:00 PM on the 14th, speaking in mixed accents and breaking into the house with weapons. Li Yaocheng and other men, women, old and young were tied up with ropes and arbitrarily searched and looted. Thirty piculs of white rice and a pair of gold rings were looted before they swaggered away. The victim has reported to the county government and requested an arrest.</p>
<h3>Ming Dynasty Jade Artifacts Unearthed from Ancient Tomb</h3>
<p>In a wasteland on Fengche Hongxi in Kunshan County, there are three graves. The land was previously owned by Lu Xingru of Kunshan and recently sold to Liu Weihua of the Cemetery Church. Liu hired Wang Da from Jiangbei to cultivate the land. Wang excavated the graves, first digging the pit in the northeast corner. The pit was covered with two stone slabs, each more than a foot thick and fifty square feet wide. When the workers removed the stone slabs, a set of coffins appeared. After digging up the set of coffins, two coffins appeared, submerged in water. The coffin wood was not very large, but it was extremely strong. Wang and others believed that there must be treasure in the meticulous pit, so they opened the coffins. The corpses were not decayed, wearing yellow clothes, with their hands, feet, face, eyes, teeth, and tongue all intact. A piece of white jade was placed on the female corpse, about five inches long, with a dragon-shaped pattern engraved on it, and a round copper mirror, engraved with the words "Made in the Jiajing Year." The matter was reported to the local Public Security Bureau. The bureau considered Wang Da to be inhumane and immediately ordered the police to arrest him. Wang fled upon hearing the news. The Public Security Bureau has ordered workers to bury the tomb base.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Extension of Additional Land Price Tax</h3>
<p>The Wu County government is collecting the first installment of the land price tax for the 22nd year. Since the collection began two months ago, according to regulations, a late payment penalty of 10% will be added starting from the 21st of this month. The County Farmers' Association and others have requested the county government to postpone the additional levy due to the hardship of the farmers, in order to alleviate their difficulties. County Magistrate Zou has approved the request, extending the deadline by ten days, with the additional levy to be added according to regulations from January 1st.</p>
<h3>Additional Interval Trains on the Sujia Road</h3>
<p>After the Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway, which directly connects Suzhou to Jiaxing, Zhejiang, opened to long-distance buses on the 10th of this month, business has been developing quite well. Now, the road management office, due to the particularly crowded passenger traffic between Suzhou and Shengze, has transported two large and small passenger buses from Shanghai yesterday (the 16th). Starting from the 18th, additional interval trains will be added to the Suzhou-Jiaxing route, with two round trips each day. The departure times from Suzhou to Shengze are 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM, and the departure times from Shengze to Suzhou are 8:00 AM and 2:30 PM. The original direct Suzhou-Jiaxing buses are planned to have their frequency increased in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Debt Case of the Shanghai Defense Corps Commander</h3>
<p>Wang Binyan, the commander of the Shanghai Zhabei Defense Corps, mortgaged his private property to the Shanghai National Bank in the 14th year of the Republic of China to maintain local security during the Qi-Lu War. The debt has not yet been repaid, totaling 14,135.66 yuan in principal and interest. Recently, the National Bank sued the Shanghai Local Court, and a judgment was made ordering Wang to pay the full amount. Wang argued that the details of this debt had been reported to the Central Government and that the proceeds from the sale of the arsenal land would be used for repayment. He had requested the National Bank to extend the repayment date, but the request was rejected. Therefore, he appealed the first-instance judgment to the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday (the 16th) morning, the Civil Division heard the case. Lawyer Tang Youwei and Wang Liangqing appeared in court on behalf of the National Bank, and Liu Yuanzi appeared on behalf of Wang Binyan. The judge attempted to mediate a settlement but was unsuccessful. The debate was then declared closed, and the judgment was scheduled for the 20th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Arrest of a Fraudulent Recruiting Officer for Extortion</h3>
<p>Lin Youshan from Shandong used to pull rickshaws for a living. Later, he worked as a reserve policeman in the Anti-Smuggling Patrol Team, but was dismissed due to an incident.

Recently, he has been falsely posing as a military officer and filling the role of a recruiting committee member, extorting money everywhere. Yesterday (the 16th) morning at 10:00 AM, he extorted money from Zhu Yumin, a famous doctor of traditional Chinese medicine on that road. Zhu reported the matter to the police, and they brought people from the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After a preliminary trial by Branch Chief Duan, Yang Youshan was deemed extremely hateful for repeatedly posing as a military officer and extorting money within the jurisdiction. A special document was prepared, and police were dispatched to transfer both parties to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation. After Officer Zhang opened the court and interrogated them, he ordered them to be detained pending investigation.</p>

<h3>Local News: Sun Ke Comes to Shanghai to Talk - Central Government Agrees with Hu Hanmin's Proposal - Will Definitely Pass Unanimously at the Fourth Plenary Session - National Unity and Concentrated Power Can Be Implemented - Yin Tong's Unauthorized Approval of Traffic Should Be Revoked and Punished</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by overnight express train from Nanjing at 7:30 yesterday. At 10:00, he met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Columbia Road, stating that the central government agreed with the proposals made by Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong. Whether he will go south has not yet been decided. The details of his talk are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Central Government Agrees with Hu's Plan</h3>
<p>According to Sun, everyone can agree with Mr. Hu Hanmin's declaration on resolving the current political situation. If it is submitted to the Fourth Plenary Session in the future, it will definitely be passed unanimously. The central government not only agrees with the various items in Mr. Hu's proposed plan, but has also been thinking about implementing them for a long time. However, the method and strength are still in question. The government's power is given by everyone. Past divisions have weakened the central government's power and made it impossible to implement the plan. Therefore, to realize Mr. Hu's proposal, national unity and concerted efforts are still needed.</p>
<h3>Sun's Trip South Undecided</h3>
<p>Sun said that the central government intends to send him south to negotiate, which is indeed true, but it has not yet been decided. It mainly depends on the situation after Zhang Ji and other representatives return north to report, and then consider whether to go south. He also said that there have been no detailed reports from Zhang and others after arriving in Guangdong. The four representatives have now left Guangdong for Guangxi. The attitude of the Guangxi authorities is still the same as before and has not changed slightly. The term of the Chairman of the National Government has expired. Whether to re-elect was not discussed when he was in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>19th Route Army Concentrated in Yanping</h3>
<p>Continuing to talk about the Fujian Army, Sun said that the 19th Route Army has concentrated around Yanping. The central government has transferred a part of the bandit suppression army in Jiangxi to open up for defense. However, the war has not yet broken out. He said that the attitude of the Fujian side has eased slightly, but the facts may not be the case. The people on the Fujian side initially had no intention of repenting. Many of the Jiangxi bandits have retreated into Fujian territory, which shows that the bandit suppression military affairs are quite successful, and the alliance of the 19th Route Army with the communists also has the situation of being too big to fail.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Asks for Loan to Regulate Finance</h3>
<p>Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang, was ordered to attend the Central Standing Committee to request a loan of 15 million yuan. The purpose is purely to regulate Guangdong's finances and has nothing to do with military expenses. The method is for the Guangdong authorities to raise funds from Hong Kong and Guangdong merchants and bankers, and ask the central government to designate collateral, but it has not been decided yet. However, it is necessary to plan in advance, so there is this request.</p>
<h3>Yin Tong's Ultra Vires Should Be Dismissed</h3>
<p>Finally, when asked about the Beining Railway opening to traffic, Sun immediately became furious and said that the central government has never made such a decision on the Beining Railway opening to traffic. Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, conducted negotiations with the Japanese side without authorization, which is an act of ultra vires. This matter must be approved by the Legislative Yuan and decided by the Central Political Council. Even the Ministry of Railways cannot disobey the order of the Central Political Council. How dare a mere director of the bureau represent the central government? It can be said to be extremely absurd. This kind of action should be immediately dismissed from his position, etc.</p>
<h3>French Minister Weilitun Returns to His Country Yesterday - The Consulate Holds a Farewell Meeting - Many French Citizens Participate</h3>
<p>French Minister to France Weilitun, who will be returning to his post as minister to France, has been granted permission by the French government to take a half-year leave to return to his country. He left Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM on the French postal ship La Rousel, accompanied by his wife and Mr. Honorat, a member of the French Senate. All the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Consul Farewell</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon was the date for the French Minister to return to his country. The French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Merley, specially held a farewell meeting at the consulate around 1:30 to say goodbye to the French Minister. The French citizens who came to see him off surrounded the auditorium, about 200 people, shaking hands with each other as a courtesy, and the sound of (Bon Jaur) (French for good morning) was endless. Several white-clad waiters were on the stage, each holding a plate with beer and cigarettes, so that the farewell participants could freely take and eat. The cigarette was printed with the word (Natione) (meaning Sun Yat-sen's nationalism). The yellow-black tobacco is loved by the French.</p>
<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>The meeting was then announced to begin. Because there were no seats in the hall, the farewell participants all stood and waited. The French love freedom, but they especially like to maintain order. The meeting procedure was also very simple and solemn, without any music or other things. First, the French Consul General Mr. Merley gave a speech at the opening of the meeting, praising Mr. Weilitun a lot, and hoping that he would return to Shanghai soon. Then the French Minister gave a farewell speech. His language was humorous, and the listeners were moved from time to time. After the French Minister finished his speech, everyone applauded. In the midst of this applause, the farewell meeting was announced to be closed.</p>
<h3>Wharf Farewell</h3>
<p>The La Rousel docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Middle Pier and was scheduled to start anchoring at 3:00 PM. Therefore, the French Minister and the Chinese and foreign farewell participants arrived at the pier one after another around 2:00. On our side, those who arrived included Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, Central Committee Member Li Shizeng, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Haian, and Chen Shiguang, the former director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc. On the foreign guest side, in addition to the French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Merley, and the staff of the embassy and consulate, diplomatic personnel from various embassies and consulates in this port, and Mr. Wei's relatives and friends, all arrived at the wharf to say goodbye, totaling more than 100 people.</p>
<h3>French Minister Boards the Ship</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, a standing member of the National Economic Council, had a very close friendship with Minister Wei. Therefore, he specially drove to the French Consulate on the Bund yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to visit Mr. Wei and express his respect for his farewell. He also presented Mr. Wei with a silver bottle. After an hour of pleasant conversation, he left. Mr. Wei arrived at the wharf at 2:20 and boarded the La Rousel with the farewell participants. He also prepared champagne in the ship's auditorium to entertain the guests. At 2:50, the farewell participants said goodbye to Mr. Wei and disembarked one after another.</p>
<h3>Returns to Office Next Spring</h3>
<p>Minister Wei said to the farewell participants in the ship, I am taking a temporary leave to return to my country this time, and I will return to Shanghai around March next year to meet you again, etc. During the period of Minister Wei's return to his country, all matters of the embassy will be temporarily handled by Mr. He Berno, the counselor of the embassy. As for the signing of the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty, the French Minister will take the opportunity of this return to his country to consult with the government of that country, so that he can continue to resolve it after returning to office next spring, etc.</p>
<h3>Yun Huifang Released Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court declared that the Eurasian Society was innocent. Yun Huifang, a member of the Iron and Blood Anti-Traitor Corps, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau on August 2 for throwing bombs to warn treacherous merchants selling Japanese goods. She was transferred to the Second Special District Court and sentenced to two months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. Afterwards, Yun used the same method again at a certain coal shop on Xinzha Road and was arrested by the Public Concession Police Department and handed over to the First Special District Court, which sentenced her to three months of imprisonment. Yun was dissatisfied with the sentence and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, but was rejected. Yun then appealed to the Supreme Court, which finally declared her innocent. Therefore, she was released by the court yesterday.</p>
<h3>First Batch Shipped to Shanghai - American Wheat Arrives Today</h3>
<p>The first batch of American wheat, borrowed from the United States and shipped to Shanghai, was loaded with 8,970 tons on the Wu Wheel Yale Foverbank and sailed from Portland on November 20. It passed through the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai. Due to fog and other reasons on the way, it was five days late. Yesterday, the owner of the Yale Foverbank had a telegram to Shanghai saying that it could arrive at Wusong Port this afternoon (the 17th) and be prepared to import with a water pilot at Songkou. It would be berthed at the Sixteen and Seventeen Two River Sections. The hatches will be opened for transfer tomorrow. Also, the second batch of 8,000 tons of American wheat was shipped by the American ship Yale Gen. Yesterday, a telegram was also received stating that the ship was about to arrive in Japan. It can probably be imported on Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning next week.</p>
<h3>American Ship Enters the Port - Damages Nine Sailing Ships</h3>
<p>The total loss is about 2,000 yuan. Nine ships including Yancheng sand ship Jin Yongfa, Shanghai sand ship Jin Jutai, Chongming ship Yang Changshun, Jiangbei pig ship Wang Hexing, Chen Yitai, Ningbo fishing boat Zhang Shunxing, Jin Dexing, Jin Caiyuan, and Shen Jintai, etc., were either importing fresh pigs and cabbage, or importing yellow sand and gravel, or exporting groceries. Because they were waiting for the customs to issue customs documents, all the ships were anchored within the waterway designated for civilian ships in Pudong by the Zhanghuabang Hebo Sishu in Paotai Bay. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM yesterday, a large American merchant ship named Steel Scientist entered the port. In order to avoid colliding with a Shaoxing sailing ship, the ship turned its bow to the east Pudong Bank. The ship's original plan was to turn its bow to the west to correct itself after avoiding the Shaoxing ship, but unexpectedly, the wind was strong and the tide was rapid at that time, resulting in a loss of driving control, and it rushed straight into the civilian ship anchorage, damaging the nine sand ships above, either damaging the bow or destroying the stern, side boards, etc. At that time, there were many cargo ships parked there, causing great chaos in the order. Afterwards, the ship reached within the high tide line and the rudder was able to obey orders, so it was able to sail to Shanghai. The ship owners who were hit afterwards reported to Xie Da, Jiang Xiangtai, Shun Jinji, He Jinji, and Runtai and other customs declaration agencies. The ship owners have jointly submitted a report to the Zhanghuabang Hebo Si to demand compensation from the American merchant ship for the losses, etc.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong and Others Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, Tang Youren, and Liang Hancao left Beijing on the night express train last night and are expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Temporary Martial Law Imposed in the City Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rumors of Counter-Revolutionary Elements Taking the Opportunity to Riot - The Entire Military and Police Force Was Mobilized Until the Evening Was Peaceful - The Shanghai Municipal Government received a secret report yesterday stating that counter-revolutionary elements were planning to riot yesterday. Considering the serious situation of the Fujian Rebellion, it was deeply feared that it would affect local security. Therefore, it specially notified the Songhu Garrison Command to order the Municipal Security Office, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Defense Corps, etc., to announce temporary special martial law starting from 8:00 AM yesterday. Therefore, starting from 8:00 AM yesterday, the Nanshi Shiliupu, Xiaodongmen, Xinbeimen, Laobeimen, Laoximen, Fangbang Road, Zhabei Baoshan Road, Luxi Caojiadu, the border area between the Chinese Concession, and the Pudong factory area, as well as Xiaoximenwai, Dalin Road, the Public Stadium, etc., were all assigned a large number of supervisors by Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hong'en, who ordered the Supervisory Department to dispatch them, along with detectives, female inspectors, and police squad leaders, to be stationed in sections and search suspicious pedestrians. Other key points were reinforced by the heads of each district, and the bureau's patrol team was also fully mobilized to patrol back and forth. The waters of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek were patrolled by a large number of police officers assigned by the water patrol team leader, riding patrol boats to inspect back and forth and check suspicious ships. The Songhu Garrison Command and the Municipal Security Office temporarily deployed sentries in quiet places such as Longhua Xiaomuqiao and Zhabei to increase security. Around 9:00 PM, all places were still as peaceful as usual. ○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<h3>Huang Nai-shu to Set Sail on Schedule =Departure on the President Coolidge on the 19th= =Huang Discusses Accusation by Postal Workers' Union, Awaiting Thorough Investigation by the Ministry=</h3>
<p>Huang Nai-shu, Director-General of the Postal Administration and the Chinese representative appointed to attend the International Postal Conference, addressed the Central Government regarding the petition from the postal workers' union accusing him of undermining the postal service and requesting his dismissal for investigation. To clarify everything, Mr. Huang went to Beijing a few days ago to meet with Zhu Jia-hua, the Minister of Transportation. Having completed his business, he took the night express train back to Shanghai at 7:30 yesterday morning. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency met with Mr. Huang at the Postal Administration yesterday morning. According to him, his trip to Beijing was to meet with Minister of Transportation Zhu Jia-hua to thoroughly explain and request a thorough investigation of the accusations made by the postal workers' union in order to clarify the truth. He also intended to postpone his departure to await the resolution of this matter, but Minister Zhu did not grant his request and still ordered him to depart on schedule. As his strong request was not granted, he could only prepare to depart on the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Company on the 19th of this month to attend the conference in Cairo, Egypt. He plans to take the opportunity after the Postal Conference to inspect the postal services of England, France, Italy, Germany, and other countries, in order to use them as a reference for improving China's postal service after his return. Therefore, this trip will take about six months before he can complete his business and return to the country. Those accompanying Mr. Huang include Zeng Yue, a secretary from the Ministry of Transportation; Mei Ding, a postal worker from the Postal Administration; Han Xiyuan, a staff member; and a retinue of six people in total.</p>
<h3>Yang De-zhao Arrives in Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yang De-zhao, representative of Chen Ji-tang, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route Army for Bandit Suppression in the Five Provinces of Guangdong, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. When the Fujian Rebellion occurred, he came north on Chen's orders to report on Guangdong's defense to the Central Government and Chairman Chiang, and to request a Central Government guarantee for a loan of 15 million yuan from the Guangdong-Hong Kong business community to alleviate the financial panic in Guangdong Province, and to negotiate additional military funding. It is now known that Mr. Yang completed his official business in Beijing yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai. He is scheduled to take the Dollar Company's President Hoover to Hong Kong on the 19th and then proceed to Guangdong to report everything to Mr. Chen and prepare to celebrate his father's 70th birthday.</p>
<h3>Marconi's Wireless Message from the Ship</h3>
<p>Responding to New Year Greetings from Academic Organizations. Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy, visited the Far East, first touring Japan, then passing through Dalian, the three eastern provinces, Tianjin and Beijing before reaching Shanghai. During his stay in Shanghai, he received a grand welcome from all sectors. He stayed for five days and returned to the country on the Italian ship Conte Rosso at 3 p.m. on the 12th of this month. While in Japan, he received a warm welcome from all levels of society, and congratulatory telegrams poured in from all over. Marconi temporarily hired two female typists to reply to each one, demonstrating the fervent reception of Marconi by the Japanese public. This shows their reverence for scientists and their use of this event to educate the public about the greatness of wireless technology and to enhance the scientific thinking of young students. When Marconi came to China, the reception he received was far less enthusiastic than in Japan. Fortunately, when Mr. Marconi arrived in Shanghai, fourteen academic and educational organizations initiated a grand reception, expressing their deep intentions. The organizations telegraphed a New Year's greeting via wireless. The message stated “To Marconi and his wife on the Conte Rosso, wishing you a safe journey and a Super Merry Christmas and a Unidireetiona New Year. From the Shanghai Fourteen Academic and Educational Organizations” The message, with its unique choice of words, was sent in the afternoon, and Marconi replied at 8:34 PM, via radio from the Conte Rosso, “To Principal Fang Ziwei of the Shanghai China Wireless Engineering School, and to the Fourteen Academic and Educational Organizations, I was treated with great kindness during my stay in Shanghai, and now I have received your telegram of New Year's greetings. I respectfully express my sincere thanks with heartfelt gratitude. Marconi.”</p>
<h3>Wireless Telegraph Service Between Shanghai and Hong Kong Has Been Available for Some Time</h3>
<p>According to the International Telegraph Office, wireless telegraph service between Shanghai and Hong Kong has been available since July 1, 1929. The report in various Shanghai newspapers on the 14th that wireless telegraph service between Shanghai and Hong Kong is currently being prepared is a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Plane Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping line, which departed Beiping at 7 a.m. the day before yesterday (Friday), was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 4 p.m. However, the plane telegraphed that after arriving in Qingdao at noon, it was unable to proceed due to heavy fog, so it stayed in Qingdao overnight. It took off yesterday morning and arrived at Longhua Airport at 11 a.m.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Qinzhou and Lianzhou Sugar Merchants, Pang Songhui, Pass Through Shanghai to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Pang Songhui, the representative of the sugar merchants of Qinzhou and Lianzhou in Guangdong, has four objectives, is passing through Shanghai to petition in Nanjing because the Jianghai Customs arbitrarily detained and fined native sugar shipped from Beihai to Shanghai. He has been entrusted by the Beihai Chamber of Commerce, the Hepu County Chamber of Commerce, and the Qinzhou-Lianzhou Sugar Industry Guangyi Hall to carry sugar samples and a petition to Nanjing. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Guangdong on the Yisheng Wheel and is currently staying at the Asia Hotel. Because this matter concerns the life and death of Chinese sugar merchants and has a major impact on agriculture and commerce, reporters specially visited Mr. Pang at the hotel to ask about the circumstances. A record of their conversation follows: (Reporter) Can you tell us about the circumstances of this case? (Pang) From July to September of this year, the Qinlian sugar merchants Heli, Henghe, Longguang, Changhe, and Heyi shipped native white sugar from Beihai to Shanghai five times. Each time, they reported to Beihai Customs for inspection, which confirmed that it was purely native sugar. They paid taxes according to regulations and were released. Unexpectedly, when the sugar was directly shipped to Shanghai, the Taipan of the Jianghai Customs completely detained it, claiming that it contained 10% to 20% foreign sugar. A total of 1,560 yuan in fines and 1,957 yuan in supplementary taxes were levied. (Reporter) How does this case affect society? (Pang) The impact is extremely significant. Beihai is the main hub for the export of native sugar from the southern counties of Guangdong and Guangxi. Thirty years ago, the annual export volume often reached between 300,000 and 400,000 dan. The economic foundation of Qinzhou and Lianzhou is based on the sugar industry. Since the dumping of foreign sugar, the native sugar industry has been severely hit. In recent years, exports have almost disappeared. Fortunately, last year the government heavily taxed foreign sugar to prevent its dumping. Exports of Beihai native sugar increased from more than 5,000 dan to more than 30,000 dan. It was hoped that this would increase daily and restore the old view. Now, this case has unfortunately occurred, and the sugar merchants, who are innocent, have been fined heavily and have all suspended business. The market losses are not insignificant. This is one aspect. More than ten counties of Qinzhou, Lianzhou, etc., rely on sugar cane planting and sugar making as their main secondary industries. If the sugar industry goes bankrupt, the rural economy and public safety will be greatly alarmed. This is the second. Since the tax increase on foreign sugar, industrialists and overseas Chinese from all over the world have been planning to invest in the Qinzhou-Lianzhou industry. According to recent reports, Hong Kong sugar magnates Mo Yingyuan and Zhuang Chengzhong planned to invest hundreds of thousands of yuan to cultivate sugar cane on Xuwen Mountain in the Leizhou Peninsula and set up a factory in Beihai to refine white sugar using machinery. However, due to land rights obstacles, this has not yet been carried out. Furthermore, overseas Chinese industrialists Mr. Huang and Mr. Luo had planned to set up large-scale sugar refineries in Wuli, Bolao and other places in Ling Mountain County to imitate foreign sugar. Now, because of this case, they are all stunned and shelved. This is the third point. (Reporter) Is there absolutely no foreign sugar mixed into the Qinzhou-Lianzhou native sugar shipped to Shanghai? (Pang) Merchants mix goods to make a profit. The 24th grade of foreign coarse granulated white sugar costs 30 yuan per dan, while local white sugar only costs 16 or 17 yuan, a difference of almost double. Even if foreign sugar could be imported duty-free, the cost would still be more than 16 yuan per dan, which is the same as native sugar. Given this market situation, even if the government did not interfere, the sugar merchants would not mix it, let alone face fines and confiscation. Furthermore, the Jianghai Customs began detaining our Guangdong native sugar in April of this year. Since then, it has happened several times every month. The fines for Qinlian native sugar occurred after July. Several months passed in between. If there was punishable conduct, how could they repeatedly make the same mistake and suffer losses? (Reporter) Why is the Beihai Customs' inspection of native sugar correct and the Jianghai Customs' incorrect? (Pang) The Beihai Customs is close to the sugar production area and is familiar with the difference between native sugar and foreign sugar, so there are no misunderstandings or obstructions. However, the Jianghai Customs has never been familiar with Qinzhou-Lianzhou native sugar. The shipment of this native sugar to Shanghai is a recent event. Due to inspection errors, this detention and fine occurred. Otherwise, if Qinzhou-Lianzhou native sugar had foreign sugar mixed in, it would have been punished by the Beihai Customs first, without waiting to arrive in Shanghai. (Reporter) When your representatives first went to Guangzhou to petition, what was the attitude of your province's authorities towards this case? (Pang) Recently, our province has been implementing a three-year administration plan, paying special attention to the restoration of the sugar industry. Especially the current military and political authorities, many of whom are from Qinzhou and Lianzhou, are even more concerned about the only industry in their hometown being destroyed. Therefore, when brothers arrived in Guangzhou to petition, all authorities expressed their willingness to help. The Guangdong Provincial Government also prepared a memorandum to be taken by the brothers to Nanjing and presented to the Ministry of Finance for prompt investigation and handling in order to protect domestic products. (Reporter) What is the purpose of your representatives going to Beijing to petition this time? (Pang) The joint conference of our chamber of commerce resolved four items regarding this case: (1) Please ask the Ministry of Finance to correct the Jianghai Customs' erroneous methods of inspecting the difference between native sugar and foreign sugar. (2) Please ask the Ministry of Finance to order the Jianghai Customs to release the Beihai sugar merchants' native sugar and return all past fines and supplementary taxes. (3) Please ask the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to order all customs houses across the country to ensure the safety of native sugar exports and imports, and not to deliberately create obstacles. (4) Please ask the Central Government to explicitly exempt native sugar from export and transit taxes, and to establish measures to encourage native sugar exports. Brothers will petition the central authorities in accordance with the above four items and will not stop until the goals are achieved.</p>

<h3>Yang Hu Takes Leave to Return to His Hometown</h3>
<p>His duties are temporarily assumed by the Deputy Director. Yang Xiaotian, the Director of the Municipal Security Bureau, has taken leave to return to his hometown for important matters. Mr. Yang is from Ningguo County, Anhui Province, and his round trip to his hometown will take about a week. He has already applied for leave from the Municipal Government. However, the duties of the Municipal Security Bureau are very important. During this week, all documents will be temporarily handled by Deputy Director Zeng Zesheng.</p>
<h3>Salt Merchants from the Four Riverbanks Petitioned the Ministry to Allow Tax Compensation for Submerged and Lost Salt</h3>
<p>Salt for consumption in the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, West Anhui, and Jiangxi has been supplied by Huai Salt, which is transported thousands of miles inland. This is very different from the conditions in other provinces. It was originally a government-managed, merchant-transported operation. In the event of flooding or banditry, one-time tax exemptions for transporting the tax for lost salt were allowed. However, last month, the General Audit Office submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance to abolish the old rules for tax compensation. However, the merchants believe that the tax rate on the four riverbanks exceeds double the cost. If tax compensation is abolished, then in the event of an accident, in addition to the merchant's tax loss, they would have to pay the tax for salt they don't have to those who were supposed to receive the salt. They petitioned the Ministry of Finance to cancel the original order and sent many representatives to Shanghai to appeal. Their petition stated that each salt permit requires about 70,000 yuan. The transportation route is more than 3,000 miles. Even if the tax is waived for losses, the merchants only receive a profit of 1.5 yuan per tax, excluding costs. If this loss is added, one consignment of salt would be enough to bankrupt them. As for investing in insurance, the tax on the riverbank exceeds three times the cost of the salt. Not only is it difficult for insurance companies to underwrite, but merchants also do not have the resources to pay the insurance premiums for government taxes. Moreover, Hunan riverbank insurance only covers routes above Yuezhou. The transfer to lighter boats over the 3,000 mile distance, and the Xiang River and Chuan River in Hubei, are even more dangerous routes. How can an insurance company guarantee this? If it is said that the losses are not real, then how can the investigations by administrative auditors, the attention of anti-smuggling along the way, and the eyes and ears of the local people be concealed? Moreover, merchants have capital, boatmen have their livelihoods. Who would risk trying to get lucky by acting recklessly? Even if the salt has been transported to the warehouse, there is still the risk of warehouse flooding. More than ten of the twenty riverbank warehouses in Hunan were flooded during the great flood. Under these circumstances, not only are those who have been consulted afraid to pay taxes, but even those who have paid taxes are afraid to launch their boats. It seems that they have no choice but to stop transportation together. Please allow them to continue to operate in accordance with the old regulations to ensure commercial stability and protect tax revenue.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the National Salt Merchants Association</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Ministry of Finance, Shanghai newspapers reported that the National Salt Merchants Association petitioned the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to establish separate salt administration audit offices. However, after thorough investigation, the statements in the original petition were largely inconsistent with the facts. Furthermore, the National Salt Merchants Association had not been approved and registered by the Ministry of Industry. The legal status of this organization is still in question.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seriously Handles the New Cultural Bookstore's Purchase of Inferior Paper The Number of Invoices Submitted Differs Greatly from the Amount of Paper Used</h3>
<p>After identification by the Qianye Association and confirmation by the Shuye Association, the evidence is deemed solid. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a report from the Qianye Association accusing the New Cultural Bookstore of using inferior goods to print and sell books such as "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio". The Chamber of Commerce forwarded the case to the Shuye Association for investigation. The reply stated that the books were indeed inferior goods, but the bookstore was not a member of the association and asked for sanctions. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce then published the details of the case in the newspapers to inform the public. Subsequently, the New Cultural Bookstore sent a letter defending itself, stating that the paper was purchased from six paper stores, including Xingji. Seventeen invoices were attached, requesting an investigation. The Chamber of Commerce then sent the invoices to the paper industry for review. The results showed that the paper sold by Yiji and other stores was Western paper and was not inferior. However, the bookstore had recently used more than 10,000 reams of paper. The seventeen invoices totaled only 6,165 reams of Western paper and 16 reams of Kraft paper. The numbers differed greatly. After receiving the reply, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent another letter to the New Cultural Bookstore yesterday stating that the various matters stated in the association's reply indicated that the quantity of goods on the seventeen invoices submitted by your bookstore differed by almost four-tenths from the quantity of paper used up to the time this case occurred. The mixing of Japanese paper is one matter, and the discussion of using Western paper with various paper merchants is another matter. The two should not be confused. Moreover, the mixing of Japanese paper in your bookstore's book "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" was first identified by the paper industry and then confirmed by the book industry. The evidence provided by the legal organizations should be considered factual. In addition to returning the seventeen invoices with this letter, we hereby inform you.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Vocational Introduction Committee Temporarily Postpones the Recruitment of Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Company initiated the National Goods Promotion Group and the Family Service Group, which have been in preparation for more than half a month. A meeting was convened at the Ningbo Association, and it was resolved to organize a National Goods Vocational Introduction Committee to provide relief to unemployed people from the same hometown. The committee specially appointed Lin Mianzhai as the director-general to handle all planning and documentation matters. Since Mr. Lin began working on it, he has drafted the service guidelines and other matters. However, the printing of various items is still pending, so the recruitment of members must be postponed slightly.</p>
<h3>Special District National Goods Sports Meet Temporary Sheds Were All Dismantled Yesterday The Fire Brigade Said They Did Not Comply with Fire Safety Regulations</h3>
<p>The temporary commercial market of the Special District National Goods Sports Exhibition, sponsored by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, was originally scheduled to open for business yesterday morning. However, the Fire Brigade said that its lead-skin sheds did not comply with fire safety regulations and were banned. Therefore, the goods transported by the manufacturers were transported back in the afternoon the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, the dismantling of the factory sheds began. By yesterday afternoon, they had been completely demolished, and lead skins were scattered all over the ground, which was a major blow to the national goods movement. The China National Products Manufacturers Association convened a meeting of manufacturer representatives at 5 p.m. yesterday. More than 100 representatives from 89 participating manufacturers attended. Liu Zhongying was elected chairman, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) In order to remedy the situation and make arrangements for the aftermath, the association will strive to complete the notification to the Public Concession Municipal Council within ten days. (2) Within possible limits, make every effort to open early, with New Year's Day as the latest deadline. (3) All matters will be handled by the committee with full authority. The committee will also hold a meeting once every day at 2 p.m. (4) If the original site cannot be used, another suitable location will be selected and opened on New Year's Day. (5) All news will be announced to all manufacturers in a timely manner to maintain communication. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m.</p>
<h3>National Goods Promotion Association Assists Changzhou National Exhibition</h3>
<p>In order to expand the promotion of national goods, promote the products of members, and implement the new plan of bringing national goods to the countryside, the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, entrusted by Mr. He Xiaohu and other gentlemen and merchants in Changzhou, is co-organizing the Changzhou China National Goods Market. In addition to notifying all factories in Shanghai to seek participation, all measures are designed and formulated by Executive Committee Member Chen Binghui and Secretary-General Xu Qiaoqi, reaching the utmost perfection. For participating factories, there is further protection. The leading figures from all sectors of the local party, government, military, police, gentry, business, and academia have expressed their thorough agreement and cooperation. The market is tightly organized, large-scale, financially strong, well-equipped, and its business will inevitably flourish. In order to protect the interests of its members, the association stipulates that, in addition to complex products, each industry will have priority to participate if they register first. There are no exceptions. In order to reduce the burden on members, it will collect extremely low market fees and conduct a three-month trial run. Once the business is extremely secure, it will continue to operate for a long time. In recent days, many factories have been actively registering. However, due to the limited number of categories, those who arrive later in the same industry are all regretful. Last night, it specially dispatched skilled staff members Xu Yaomei, Chen Guming, Hu Zishi, and Wen Jichun to Changzhou to assist the organizers of the market in arranging and proceeding with the preparations. They also carried a large number of colorful advertisements and promotional materials to conduct widespread publicity in the counties and towns of Jiangyin, Danyang, Yixing, Liyang, Jintan, and Wuxi in Changzhou Kunlian, in order to arouse public attention.</p>

<h3>Seriously Pay Attention to Grain Transportation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways ordered the railway bureaus to comply with the instructions. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which stated: "The Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 573. It was found that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had previously sent a telegram requesting the Ministries of Railways and Communications to give priority to allocating ships and vehicles to those requesting to transport rice, to properly discuss joint transportation methods, to reduce transportation procedures, and to reduce freight rates. After the two ministries promptly discussed the matter, the ministry submitted a report on the progress of reducing grain transportation prices, which was forwarded to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Now, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram was received, saying that he was very pleased with the telegram. The Ministry of Railways' planning for reducing food prices and facilitating transportation is already thorough, and it is hoped that it will continue to supervise the implementation. As for the shipping part, it is requested that the Ministry of Communications be instructed to promptly discuss the matter in order to connect and benefit farmers and merchants. In addition to replying by telegram and issuing separate orders, it is necessary for the ministry to supervise its subordinates at all times to implement the matter seriously. Upon receipt, this case was previously approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanchang Headquarters by telegram on the 1st of last month. Subsequently, in order to relieve the rural areas and regulate grain transportation, it is necessary to investigate in detail at any time. If there are reasons to reduce freight rates, they should be reported to the ministry for handling. Other items, such as giving priority to allocating vehicles, should be strictly followed in accordance with the ministry's telegram and handled seriously by the subordinates, without delay. Since the instructions have been received, it is hereby ordered that they be followed. The bureau has forwarded the instructions to the Traffic Department to comply with."</p>
<h3>Unlicensed Crew Members Are Not Allowed to Serve</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Approved an Order to Strictly Crack Down on the Second Session of Crew Member Examinations in Shanghai. The Shanghai Marine Engineers' Association previously requested the Ministry of Communications to crack down on unlicensed crew members serving on various ships. The Ministry of Communications approved the request yesterday. The second session of crew member examinations is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on January 24 of next year. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Approval from the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>The Marine Engineers' Association received an approval order from the Ministry of Communications yesterday. The original text stated: "One document is submitted, requesting that all subordinates be ordered to comply with the provisions of Article 1 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations for Crew Member Examinations, to prohibit unlicensed crew members from being allowed to leave port by means of registration. It is hereby approved. It has been found that crew members who have not obtained certificates beyond the deadline have already been prohibited from serving by the Ministry in accordance with regulations. It has been ordered to all subordinates to strictly crack down. As for the claim that they are allowed to leave port by means of registration, whether or not it is true should be investigated and verified. You should be informed accordingly. Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Transportation, December 13, 1933."</p>
<h3>Examination in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation believes that the duties of marine engineers and drivers are related to the safety of passengers and cannot be ignored. Therefore, the Provisional Regulations for Crew Member Examinations were promulgated on June 1 of this year. All crew members serving on various ships must apply for examination in accordance with the law before they can serve on ships. The first examination was held in Nanjing on October 24 of this year. As a result, crew members of various ships were unable to rush to the examination due to their duties (because there are more shipping companies in Shanghai than in other places). Now, in order to facilitate the crew member examinations in Shanghai, the Ministry of Transportation has decided to hold the second examination in Shanghai on January 24 of next year.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Training Ships Will Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

Japanese residents are currently busy preparing for the welcome. They are scheduled to visit various foreign troops stationed at sea and land authorities on the 20th. On the 21st, the commander will report on the Shanghai Incident at the Japanese Marine Corps and visit the battle sites, passing by the new Shanghai Municipal Government. On the 22nd, they will visit various Japanese public and private agencies in Shanghai, passing by the old Shanghai Municipal Government. On the 23rd, they will leave the port and return to Sasebo.</p>
<h3>Various Districts in the County Are Starting to Dredge Rivers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has been ordered to conscript labor for river dredging, and plans and preparations have been made. Now that it is the agricultural off-season in winter, it is time to dredge the rivers in various districts. All districts have been instructed to comply with the order, and the district chiefs should actively promote the work. The government's technical personnel will be publicly invited to assist with the surveying and other work. If the township chiefs are unable to plan and carry out the work due to their limited capabilities, the districts should provide guidance and design on their behalf to promote its success. Therefore, various districts are actively discussing river dredging. Currently, the projects that are being planned and carried out include the Sanlintang Port in the fourth district (jointly with Nanhui County), the Yingbao River in the first district, and the Youche River in the second district. Dredging committees have been established to begin conscripting labor for dredging.</p>
<h3>Report on Disaster Relief in Heze, Shandong Province</h3>
<p>The China Jishi Society, together with the Yellow River Flood Relief Society and various charitable organizations, has been handling emergency relief for the Yellow River flood disaster in Heze, Shandong Province. Previous reports have been made. Now, Director Li Yunmen has completed the distribution and returned to Shanghai, bringing with him a detailed account of the relief efforts as follows: Heze County is divided into twenty townships. Except for Chonghou, Dongping, and Yongshun, which were not affected, the five townships of Liming, Xunde, Lingsheng, Changming, and Qingqiu, being located on higher ground, suffered relatively severe damage. The people's livelihoods can be temporarily maintained, so no investigation or distribution was conducted. However, the twelve townships of Pingling, Tonghe, Xihe, Qianyuan, Gangfeng, Yiju, Linhe, Dehua, Yonghe, Baozhen, Xincheng, and Yongsui suffered more severely. Director Li personally surveyed the extent of the damage, selected staff to investigate each household, and issued tickets to the poorest residents to receive funds, using the characters "Jue," "Shi," "Fang," "Neng," and "Cheng" to represent six yuan, five yuan, four yuan, three yuan, and two yuan, respectively, in five grades. The characters "Shang" and "Xia" were used to represent one piece each of a padded coat and trousers. In total, twelve townships, five hundred and sixty villages, and twelve thousand seven hundred and eighty-six households, with thirty-three thousand six hundred and seventy-two adults and twenty-five thousand and six children, received relief amounting to fifty-five thousand and thirty-seven yuan in silver, and five thousand six hundred and ten sets of clothing. In Tonghe township, thirty-nine households received additional characters: two "Jue," two "Shi," four "Fang," twenty-six "Neng," and five "Cheng," totaling thirty-nine additional characters, due to the particularly severe disaster they suffered. In addition, temporary small relief totaling two hundred and fifty-nine yuan and eight jiao was distributed, along with forty-five thousand bottles of various medicines, dispensed according to the specific illnesses. Given the severity of the disaster in Heze, this small amount is truly a drop in the bucket.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau - Delivery of Land Value Tax Notices</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Finance Bureau announced on the 21st of this month that land value tax for Maps 1 to 7 of the Hunan District and Maps 1 and 2 of the Zhabei District will be collected, it is understood that property owners consider the tax notice as proof for paying the land value tax at the tax collection office during this period, which is of great importance. They have been sending letters to the Municipal Finance Bureau to urge the delivery and correction of addresses, hoping to pay on time, demonstrating taxpayers' enthusiasm for paying the tax. In view of the above, the Municipal Finance Bureau is concerned that the addresses and contact information of property owners in these maps may have changed, making it difficult to deliver the notices. It hopes that those who have not yet received the notice should promptly declare their current address to the Finance Bureau before the deadline for verification and re-delivery, in order to avoid delays.</p>

After approval by the Municipal Government, a preparatory committee was established in the former county office. In addition to finding the old site of Quanzhang Middle School at the intersection of Longhua Road as the school site, it also recruited students.

<h3>Fortune Teller Xu Suichu Sentenced to Six Months</h3>
<p>Zhu Hongshun, a local resident who obtained illegal property gains through fraud, owns a considerable amount of land in the western Shanghai area. Before the Shanghai war last spring, he entrusted a land license for a property located on Zhongshan Road to Xu Suichu, a fortune teller residing at the New World Hotel, to exchange it for a new license at the Municipal Land Bureau. Unexpectedly, Xu colluded with accomplices and used the license to mortgage a large sum of money from the National Products Bank for his own use. He then falsely claimed that the old license was lost during the escape from the war disaster. Zhu Hongshun and his grandmother, Zhu Tan, rashly believed him and hastily published a notice stating that if the license was found, it should be considered invalid, hoping to deny the mortgage debt. Therefore, Song Ziliang, the president of the National Products Bank, hired lawyers Xu Shihao and Zuo Detao to file civil and criminal lawsuits against Zhu Tan, Zhu Hongshun (grandmother and grandson), Xu Suichu, and Wang Yigong, who acted as guarantor. The plaintiff won the civil case. In the criminal case, except for Zhu Tan, whose interrogation was temporarily suspended due to illness, the others were summoned by the criminal court of the First Special District Court for repeated investigations. The defense lawyer did not appear in court. Only the plaintiff's representatives, lawyers Xu and Zuo, reported on time. Judge Deng Baosun ascended to the fifth courtroom and announced the verdict: Xu Suichu was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for obtaining illegal property gains through fraud; Zhu Hongshun and Wang Yigong were found not guilty; Wang Yigong's counterclaim against Song Ziliang was dismissed; and Xu Suichu's suit against Lu Quanjing was rejected.</p>

<h3>Parricide Case Occurs in Pudong - Ji Hongwen Accuses His Elder Brother of Murdering Their Mother - Autopsy Reveals Marks on the Neck</h3>
<p>In a shack in front of Yangjing Temple on Dongchang Road, Pudong, lived Ji Fu, an old woman from Gaoyou, Jiangsu, aged 70. She had two sons, the elder son Ji Jiangcai, aged 46, worked as a cleaner and was married to Ji He, aged 41. The younger son, Ji Hongwen, aged 30, worked as a laborer at the Malianji tile factory in Dapuqiao, western Shanghai, and did not live at home. On the 12th of this month, it was Ji Fu's birthday. She wanted to decorate the house a little since she was turning 70 this year, but her elder daughter-in-law Ji He refused and was disrespectful. They had a conflict. Ji Hongwen returned home on that day to greet his mother on her birthday, saw tears on her face, and asked what had happened. He learned of his sister-in-law's unkindness and comforted his mother. He went to buy incense and candles and then left. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 14th, Ji Hongcai suddenly went to call his younger brother home, saying that their mother had died of a heart attack. Ji Hongwen was very sad and rushed back to see his mother. He saw strangulation marks around her neck. He accused his elder brother and sister-in-law of murdering their mother and reported the case to the Third District Police Station for investigation. However, Hongcai and his wife still claimed that their mother died of illness. The police, regarding the case as an accusation of parricide, ordered their detention and instructed Yao Hongsheng, the guarantor of the 24th map, to report the case to the District Court for autopsy. Prosecutor Cao Changlin, accompanied by coroner Xuan Zhiming, went to the scene and found two fingernail marks on the neck of the deceased Ji Fu, and fingerprints on the throat, indicating that she may have been suffocated by strangulation. Ji Hongwen and his maternal uncle Fu Zhaoxi also claimed that she was injured and died. Because the case involved a serious crime with significant discrepancies, it was ordered to be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for a second autopsy and ordered the police to send the defendants to the hospital for investigation. Yesterday, the Third District Police Station sent the plaintiff and defendant to the court, and ordered the guarantor to send the body to the Forensic Institute for autopsy for final determination. After a preliminary hearing in the afternoon, Prosecutor Cao ordered the detention of the defendants. The body was sent to the Forensic Institute for a second autopsy.</p>
<h3>The Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case - Trial Concluded Yesterday - Culprits Detained for Sentencing in 20 Days</h3>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, a native of Ningbo, also known as Ah Yu, the former manager of the Rongji Game Hall in the Great World, was shot and killed by thugs in front of the Great World at 2 AM on June 18th this year. A passerby, Wu Guangcai, was also killed by stray bullets. The police have successively arrested two suspects, Zhang Tinggui, alias Xiao Sizi, from Funing, and Zhao Guangfu, from Yangzhou, and confiscated a Browning pistol from Zhao. They were charged with premeditated murder and prosecuted in the Second Special District Court. Zhang and Zhao admitted that Wang Jinkui, who is still at large, had asked Zhou, a carpenter, to hire them to carry out the shooting. The details of their confessions have been previously reported. At the time of the incident, the police found eight bullet casings at the scene. The police's firearms technicians, after comparing the bullet casings with Zhao's pistol, confirmed that three of the casings were fired from Zhao's pistol and submitted a report to the court with verification certificates. The case was originally presided over by Judge Zhang Chaozuo, but he was transferred to the Higher Third Branch, so Judge Wu Fanglian took over. The hearing was reopened by Judge Wu the day before yesterday. (The confessions of the two defendants are the same as those previously reported and will not be repeated.) After designating lawyer Cao Lin as the defense counsel for the defendants, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled the sentencing for the 20th. The defendants were returned to custody pending the sentencing.</p>
<h3>Robbers Attempted to Rob Tram Company - Unable to Act Due to Locked Iron Box - Company Tea Boy Also Knew About It</h3>
<p>The Chief Inspector of the General Patrol Room, Lu Liankui, learned that a gang of robbers was hiding at No. 86 North Shansi Road, planning to rob the Shanghai Tram Company at No. 7 Suzhou Road. He immediately dispatched Chinese Detectives Liu Shaokui and Feng Zhiming, Detective Zhou Honglin and others, to arrest the following Suzhou native Ji Fusheng, Tongzhou native Zhang Asi, Nanxun native Wang Yongqing, Zuxing native Ye Shaolin, women Cao Ma, Xu Chen, and Jia Wang, a total of seven people, at the address at 6:30 PM yesterday. A pistol and several bullets were found on their persons, and two fake pistols were found under the bed in the house. They confessed that they had gone to the Tram Company at 5:30 PM to rob, but the iron box of the company was already locked, so they were unable to act. Their informant was Zhang Anbao, a tea boy from Nanxun at the company. The detectives arrested Zhang as well and took them all into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, explained the case and stated that the police were conducting a thorough investigation, so he requested a postponement of the trial. Judge Feng questioned each defendant and ordered them to be returned to custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>The Ningjing Steamer is Unable to Escape Danger - All Crew Members Dismissed - Losses Reaching Over 80,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Ningjing steamer of the Ningshao Company, which ran aground at Huifengji in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, can only be salvaged next spring when the water level rises. The hull is badly damaged and cannot return to Shanghai this year. The crew, sailors, and business personnel have all been dismissed and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to the crew members, the loss situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>The Cause of the Accident</h3>
<p>The Ningjing steamer ran aground on a reef in the Yangtze River on the 24th of last month. The cause was not fog, but the many hidden reefs in the river at Huifengji. The Jianghai Customs had a lightship stationed there to warn ships. Ships going up and down the river used the light as a navigation standard. Unexpectedly, the lightship broke its anchor chain and drifted out of position that day. The captain of the Ningjing, unaware of the situation, followed the light and sailed into a cluster of reefs, causing a major accident. Afterwards, the Jianghai Customs apologized to the ship owner and towed the lightship back to its original position the next day. Therefore, the Ningjing's accident was not due to the negligence of the crew.</p>
<h3>Damage to the Hull</h3>
<p>The Ningshao Company has unloaded all the cargo from the steamer and sent technicians to inspect the damaged areas. They found that the hull on both sides, from the bow to the midships, had been broken and damaged by the reefs in over one hundred places, and several places were cracked. As a result, the engine room flooded. After half a month of rescue work, the damaged areas have been temporarily filled, and the accumulated water has been pumped out. However, the ship remains aground on the reef and cannot be towed into the river.</p>
<h3>Crew Dismissed</h3>
<p>The steamer is grounded in an area where the river water is dropping daily, making it difficult to escape danger and return to Shanghai. The company decided to dismiss the staff of the business department and the midships department first and send them back to Shanghai. Now, all fifty crew members, sailors, stokers, helmsmen, etc., have been dismissed and have taken the old Ningshao steamer to Shanghai yesterday. Their salaries were paid up to yesterday and then stopped. Only a captain and two or three stokers and sailors are left on board to guard the ship. To prevent looting, two armed soldiers have also been sent to the ship for protection.</p>
<h3>Significant Losses</h3>
<p>The Ningjing steamer's grounding has caused significant losses to the company. In addition to the cost of sending ships for rescue and unloading cargo, the total direct and indirect losses are estimated to be over 80,000 yuan. The loss of revenue due to the long-term obstruction of business caused by the grounding is even greater. In addition, the loss of jobs for all the ship's officers, tea boys, and sailors is also significant.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Society of Engineers Regular Meeting</h3>

<h3>City Center - Temporary Tracks Laid on Sanmin Road</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Asks the Ministry of Railways to Instruct the Railway Bureau to Handle it. Mr. Shen Yi, Chairman of the Municipal Central District Construction Committee and Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, recently submitted a request to the Municipal Government to instruct the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau to lay temporary tracks along Sanmin Road in the central district to facilitate traffic, as the relocation of the Municipal Government and various bureaus is imminent but the road construction in the central district has not been fully completed. The Municipal Government has approved the request. The original text is as follows: Although the traffic problem in the central district has been addressed by the Hua Merchant Bus Company preparing to operate buses, the area will inevitably become more prosperous after the relocation of various agencies, and the number of people traveling will also increase significantly. Relying solely on these few buses will not be sufficient. The committee has discussed that the width of Sanmin Road in the central district is specified to be 60 meters, and only the middle part has been constructed so far. If the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau can lay temporary tracks along the side of the road (from Songhu Road along Sanmin Road to the existing railway line) to allow vehicles to pass, it would greatly facilitate traffic and contribute to the prosperity of the area. It is proposed that your office submit a request to the Ministry of Railways, instructing the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau to plan and proceed. Whether this is appropriate is submitted for your approval and implementation. The Municipal Government believes that the request is feasible and has approved consulting the Ministry of Railways and instructing the two Railway Bureaus to investigate and handle it.</p>

<h3>The Wanshan Sinks the Luyan Steamer - Rescued Soldiers Vent Their Anger</h3>
<p>The crew suffered severe beatings. The Sanbei Company's Wanshan steamer caused a disaster in Qizhou, colliding with the Luyan small steamer, resulting in the tragic drowning of more than sixty soldiers. The steamer has already left Hankou for Shanghai and will be able to enter the port tomorrow. However, after the accident, the crew members were severely beaten by angry soldiers, and some were seriously injured. Negotiations are currently underway. The reporter will report the follow-up information in detail as follows:</p>
<h3>Six Crew Members Died</h3>
<p>The Luyan small steamer was rented by the headquarters from the Xiangjiang Steamer Company. It was to be returned to the company after the transport mission was completed. The small steamer could carry more than 200 tons, and the entire crew and sailors numbered about 20. Before the collision, it was said that the Wanshan sounded a horn, but it is unknown whether the small steamer responded. When the Wanshan collided amidships, the small steamer sank instantly. All the crew members fell into the water. Afterwards, it was determined that only six members of the Luyan steamer had been rescued; the rest had drowned.</p>
<h3>Rescued Soldiers Became Enraged</h3>
<p>Over one hundred and dozens of new soldiers on the Luyan were asleep in the middle cabin when the sudden collision occurred. The middle cabin broke in two, so all the soldiers fell into the water. The upstream water was turbulent, so after falling into the water, they were immediately washed downstream. The more than sixty rescued soldiers were mostly those who knew how to swim, so they survived. After being rescued onto the boat one after another, the surviving soldiers became enraged and sought out the captain and others to exact revenge.</p>
<h3>The Captain Disguised Himself and Hid</h3>
<p>Seeing the deaths of their comrades, and some even having family and friends among the deceased, the soldiers were overcome with grief and wanted to take revenge on the captain, first mate, and duty pilot. Seeing the situation was not good, the captain, first mate, and pilot, in a moment of inspiration, each changed into the ragged clothes of the stokers and sailors, smeared their faces with coal dust, and hid elsewhere. The soldiers searched everywhere for the captain and others but could not find them, so they turned their anger on others.</p>
<h3>The Helmsman Was Severely Injured</h3>
<p>Since the soldiers could not find the captain and others after searching everywhere, they left behind several helmsmen, as their duties as drivers made it impossible for them to hide. Thus, the helmsmen became the targets of the soldiers' anger. All the helmsmen were beaten severely, and one was beaten so badly that he barely had a breath left. The injured were sent to the hospital for treatment after arriving in Hankou.</p>
<h3>The Wanshan Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The military authorities in Hankou, because the Sanbei Company already had personnel responsible for negotiations, allowed the steamer to sail. It has already loaded cargo and set sail downstream. According to a telegram yesterday, it will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The owners of the sunken Luyan steamer will seek compensation, and the families of the drowned soldiers may receive compensation.</p>
<h3>The Communications Bank and Labor University Debt Dispute - After the Judgment - University Teachers' Union Assistance</h3>
<p>The attitude of the Communications Bank. The Shanghai University Teachers' Union sent a letter yesterday to the Communications Bank to explain in detail the case of the National Tongji University and the former Labor University being forcibly sealed by the Shanghai Communications Bank due to a dispute over mortgage funds, and also sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court requesting a temporary suspension of enforcement. The bank is not strongly insisting on the seal. As follows:</p>
<h3>Mortgage Lawsuit Judgment</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Model Factory for Vagrants mortgaged all of its land, buildings, machinery, equipment, and other real estate to the China Communications Bank in August of the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), signing a overdraft contract for 150,000 taels of silver. When the National Revolutionary Army entered Shanghai, the former Shanghai Political Sub-Committee confiscated and reorganized the factory into the Labor University. The Communications Bank immediately raised an objection based on its mortgage rights, demanding that the Labor University repay the mortgage funds. The Labor University consistently delayed, making no concrete offers. At the same time, they were responsible for settling all the debts owed to the factory's workers. Therefore, the Communications Bank filed a lawsuit according to law. The case was suspended for several years and remained unresolved. After the Labor University closed down, the Labor University Custodial Committee member Weng Zhilong, who is now the president of Tongji University, represented the Labor University in the lawsuit. The Shanghai District Court ruled in the first instance that the Communications Bank should seek compensation from the Ministry of Finance. The Communications Bank disagreed and appealed. The Jiangsu High Court ruled in the second instance to overturn the original judgment and ordered the Labor University to repay the mortgage. The Labor University also appealed to the Supreme Court after losing the case. As a result, the appeal was rejected, and the Labor University was ordered to comply with the High Court's judgment to pay the Communications Bank the principal and interest of 107,792 taels, 4 mace and 5 fen of silver, as well as various advances totaling 3,168 taels, 1 mace, and 6 fen of silver, along with interest until the end of enforcement. At this point, the long-standing case was resolved after three trials.

<h3>Request for Commercial Assistance</h3>
<p>A letter from the Joint Association of University Professors to the Commercial Bank of China states: "To the esteemed leaders of the Bank: We are writing to you regarding a matter recently brought to our attention by the National Tongji University Vocational High School, which is affiliated with the university. They report that a dispute between the former Labor University and your bank is about to result in a court-ordered seizure of assets by the Shanghai District Court. It is our understanding that these assets, belonging to the former Labor University, were allocated to Tongji University by the 354th meeting of the Central Political Council. The debts of the Labor University, it was decided, would be the responsibility of national institutions, and should not impact Tongji University or its educational mission. The school requests your assistance in this matter. We have reviewed the facts, and note that the transfer of the Jiangwan campus of the former Labor University to Tongji University was indeed based on a central government order. Therefore, the transfer of property rights differs significantly from standard legal precedents. Moreover, at a time when industry and commerce are declining and the rural economy is collapsing, vocational education should be actively promoted. It would be unfortunate if the debts of the Labor University were to jeopardize the success of Tongji Vocational High School. We do not believe your bank would wish to see this happen. For the benefit of both parties, we have separately petitioned the Central Political Council to expedite the settlement of the Labor University's loan owed to your bank. We now also request that your bank exercise its discretion and pursue the recovery of the loan directly from the relevant national institutions, so as to avoid further impact on Tongji and protect this remaining vocational school. This would also uphold your bank's mission of revitalizing society and supporting productive enterprises. The future of education depends greatly on such assistance. We offer this humble request, hoping for your careful consideration."</p>
<h3>Request for Temporary Suspension of Execution</h3>
<p>A letter from the Joint Association of University Professors to the District Court states: "To the esteemed court: We are writing to you regarding a situation involving the National Tongji University Vocational High School, which is facing a court-ordered seizure of assets related to a loan dispute between the former Labor University and the Shanghai Commercial Bank. This news has caused considerable anxiety among the school community. We understand that the Jiangwan campus of the former Labor University was allocated to Tongji University by a resolution of the Central Political Council. This transfer of property rights was based on special legal provisions and differs from ordinary debt cases. Furthermore, the Central Political Council has already decided that the Ministry of Finance should be responsible for settling the debts of the former Labor University. Therefore, to uphold national credibility, it would be inappropriate to misunderstand the principal parties and directly impact the school, causing disruption to education. We are writing to you specifically to bring this matter to your attention. We respectfully request that you consider this information and, pending a resolution from the central government, temporarily suspend the execution of the seizure order to preserve education and uphold national prestige."</p>
<h3>Attitude of the Commercial Bank of China</h3>
<p>"A portion of the Labor University's property is currently occupied by a vocational high school affiliated with Tongji University. Upon hearing of the potential seizure, the school fears that its educational activities will be disrupted, leading to a movement to protect the school. Petitions have been submitted to party and government authorities, and appeals for assistance have been made to various sectors of society, attracting considerable public attention. However, the Commercial Bank of China has publicly stated that the court is acting according to the principles of judicial independence and enforcing the law, which should not be opposed by anyone. The bank agreed during the previous court hearing to temporarily suspend the execution of the order on the parts of the property used by the school. The remaining land and buildings not used by the school will be seized and auctioned according to the law to protect the bank's claims while still maintaining support for education. Initially, the school misinterpreted the law, claiming the property as its own. Later, it proposed unilateral terms that the bank could not accept. The school even refused to allow bank representatives to inspect the property. The bank, which has been established for nearly forty years, has consistently contributed to industrial, educational, and public welfare causes. Now that a legal judgment has been made, the bank cannot abandon its legal claims or sacrifice the shareholders' investment. The school's opposition to the execution, while of limited concern to the bank itself, has significant implications for the entire financial sector. If creditors cannot legally dispose of collateral securing a debt, who will be willing to accept mortgages from industrial factories or public enterprises in the future? This also has a major impact on judicial principles, the authority of the law, and the movement to regain extraterritorial rights. It is hoped that the school's teachers and students will calmly consider both legal and educational factors. The bank is reportedly not entirely resolute about executing the seizure. If the Labor University can settle its debts or find other acceptable means to secure the bank's claims, or if the mortgage rights are not infringed upon or extinguished, the bank may be willing to consider a compromise."</p>
<h3>Pudong Residents Suggest Lowering Ferry Fares</h3>
<p>Including Adding Third and Fourth Class Seating</p>
<p>"A letter from Xu Zuoxun and twenty-five other Pudong residents to the Pudong Association states: Respectfully, we the residents of Pudong frequently cross the Huangpu River to and from Shanghai, and request that the municipal ferry service reduce the first and second class fares and add third and fourth class seating to alleviate the financial burden on the less wealthy. Public services should aim to benefit the public, not to maximize revenue. Therefore, anything that can ease the burden on the people and foster their economic well-being should be pursued with all effort. Benefits for the many over profits for the few. With this in mind, we must address the issue of the municipal ferry service. Since the Shanghai-Gaoqiao ferry line began operations, passenger travel has been convenient, but the high fares are unheard of elsewhere in the country, and have long been a topic of public discussion. Moreover, the service only offers special, first, and second class seating, without any third or fourth class options. This places a heavy burden on poor villagers. The rural economy has collapsed and is on the brink of ruin. The vitality of the people has not yet recovered after the January 28th Incident. This autumn, two typhoons caused enormous agricultural losses. The seawalls have not been repaired, and the devastation remains. Furthermore, most Pudong residents are farmers and laborers who come to the city regularly to sell their produce and ply their trades. They work tirelessly, summer and winter, morning and evening, to make a living. Due to the current chaos and famine, the people are poor and goods are cheap. Agricultural products are difficult to sell even at low prices, and wages are low, leaving many without employment. As a result, many struggle to secure their daily meals. The hardship caused by high ferry fares is especially acute, something those living in the city cannot fully comprehend. We have repeatedly appealed to the authorities, but our efforts have been futile. In June of this year, news reports stated that the Ministry of Railways recognized that third and fourth class train cars are primarily used by the lower classes, the masses, and should be improved. As commerce is declining and the economy is in a state of panic, it is necessary to reduce the burden on ordinary citizens. Therefore, the ministry instructed the railway administration to improve the interior of the cars and reduce the third and fourth class fares. The administration has already submitted a proposal for fare reductions, which will be announced next month. Additionally, the ministry has added fourth class tickets for travel to and from Benniu, Suzhou, Weiting, Wuxi, Henglin, and other destinations. This demonstrates the government's concern for the poor, which is admirable. The Shangchuan Transportation Company has also implemented a reduction in second class fares, benefiting the common people. They are following government orders and truly working for the people's welfare. Transportation by water should be treated the same way, but the Shanghai municipal ferry fares have only increased, with no third or fourth class seating available. In this difficult time, when the people are suffering, it is necessary to reduce the first and second class fares and add third and fourth class seating. We, the residents of Pudong, are well aware of the hardships faced by the people. However, we fear that our voices are too small to be heard. We know that your association aims to improve the welfare of our hometown, and we believe that you will speak out on behalf of the people. Therefore, we humbly submit our suggestions for your review. We request that you forward this letter to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, instructing the Xingye Trust Company to reduce the first and second class fares of the municipal ferry service and add third and fourth class seating as soon as possible, to show compassion and benefit the common people. We eagerly await your response."</p>
<h3>Request for Duty-Free Release of Medicinal Alcohol</h3>
<p>A letter from the New Pharmaceutical Association to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce states: "Our members have reported that medicinal alcohol being shipped to the interior is being detained and fined by the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, which claims that the alcohol has not been affixed with the required 洋酒 (foreign wine/liquor) stamp tax of $1.40 per gallon. We ask for your assistance in resolving this matter. The Ministry of Finance previously intended to prevent unscrupulous merchants from passing off alcohol as 燒酒 (shaojiu/liquor) by imposing a stamp tax of $20 per 100 catties on alcohol shipped to the interior, in addition to import duties, following the example of taxes on foreign wine/liquor. At the time, the import duty was only 4 cents per gallon in national currency. However, due to the cumbersome procedures for collecting the stamp tax, the policy was not strictly enforced, and the import duty was gradually increased. The current import duty on alcohol is now twenty-three times higher than before, amounting to 45 cents in customs gold unit, including surcharges. The market price of 燒酒 (shaojiu/liquor) is $7 per 100 catties. If alcohol were to be passed off as 燒酒 (shaojiu/liquor), it would cost $12. As unscrupulous merchants have no profit to gain, they have long ceased this practice. Pure alcohol is needed for hospital treatments and pharmaceutical compounding, and is not comparable to the luxury product of 洋酒 (foreign wine/liquor). We request that you forward this letter to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the ministry consider that medicinal supplies are essential to the lives of the people, and instruct all local Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureaus to exempt medicinal alcohol shipped to the interior from the stamp tax and allow it to be released."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Revises Inspection Regulations for Bristles, Down, and Feathers</h3>
<p>"The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had previously submitted and received approval to implement inspection regulations for bristles, down, and feathers, starting on October 20th. The implementation has been proceeding smoothly for the past two months. However, the inspection of pig bristles has been particularly frequent since the inspections began, and merchants have requested revisions to the inspection procedures. To meet the actual needs, the Bureau has repeatedly deliberated and has submitted a request to the Ministry to revise Article 16 of the inspection regulations. The Ministry has approved the revision and filed the changes, which will take effect on the 18th of this month. Merchants in the industry have been notified to comply. The revised article is as follows: (Article 16) The inspection fees are as follows: Camel down, cotton wool, and cashmere: 7 cents per dan in national currency. Goat hair and cow hair, etc.: 4 cents per dan in national currency. Duck feathers: 17 cents per dan in national currency. Chicken feathers: 5 cents per dan in national currency. Duck down: 1 yuan per dan in national currency. Goose feathers: 30 cents per dan in national currency. Goose down: 1.5 yuan per dan in national currency. Pig bristle waste: 8 cents per lot in national currency. Pig bristles: 30 cents per dan in national currency. The above amounts are calculated according to the municipal system of weights and measures. The minimum inspection fee per batch is 1 yuan, which must be paid in full at once. The fee is non-refundable, regardless of whether the goods pass inspection."</p>
<h3>SMC’s Arbitrary Property Tax Assessment Resolved Through Taxpayer Association</h3>
<p>"戴聖鼎 (Dai Shengding), a taxpayer in the Shanghai International Settlement, had his property tax arbitrarily increased by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Revenue Office.

<h3>Taxpayer Association's Reply</h3>
<p>"In response to your letter of December 10th, we are pleased to learn that the Shanghai Municipal Council has charged municipal tax based on the actual property tax amount.

<p>"The Second Special District Court, following its regular practice, burned confiscated opium, morphine, heroin, red and white pills, and other narcotics and drug paraphernalia (lamps, guns), as well as gambling equipment, which had been seized by the police. This is typically done every three months. This was the eighth such burning, following seven previous burnings. The narcotics and gambling equipment seized during the three-month period from July to the end of September of this year were scheduled to be burned yesterday. Previously, Court President Ying Shi and Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan jointly issued a public notice and submitted reports to the Higher Third Branch Court and the Ministry of Justice, as well as sending letters to various military, government, police, and legal institutions in Shanghai, and to anti-drug associations and bar associations, inviting them to send representatives to supervise the burning.

<h3>Conciliation Achieved in Housing Dispute in Tui Xing Lane</h3>
<p>"The housing in Tui Xing Lane on Baker Road is managed by the Shanghai Trust Department of the 大陆 (Continental) Bank. Recently, due to the age of the buildings, the Fire Brigade of the Municipal Council inspected and determined that they needed to be rebuilt. Therefore, the Trust Department notified all tenants that they had one month to find new homes. All rent for November would be waived, but any outstanding rent had to be paid in full. Over thirty merchants, including Chen Jufeng, Mao Shuntai, Tianheguan, Xingfangzhai, and Renhe Tobacco Factory, formed the Tui Xing Lane Tenants Association, arguing that since the January 28th Incident, their businesses had been on the verge of bankruptcy. Although there had been a slight recovery recently, the market was still depressed, and most tenants were operating small businesses that were difficult to sustain. The end of the year was approaching, adding to their difficulties. If forced to move, it would be extremely difficult. Regarding the Fire Brigade's opinion that the buildings were too old and needed to be rebuilt, they argued that this was merely an opinion of the Fire Brigade, and there was no urgent need to demolish the buildings until formal notification from the Municipal Council. The association appointed lawyers Ma Junshuo and Li Caixia to file a petition with the First District Court, requesting mediation. Yesterday morning, Judge Tao Dejun convened a hearing for mediation. The Trust Department stated that the demolition of the dilapidated buildings was a necessary fact, which the tenants were aware of. They requested that the court order the tenants to pay the outstanding rent and vacate the premises within a specified period. Lawyer Ma Junshuo, representing the tenants, stated that they did not oppose the relocation, but it was difficult to move before the end of the year due to the upcoming holiday and the depressed market. They requested to be allowed to relocate by the end of March of next year, and to pay the outstanding rent in February of next year. After repeated discussions, both parties reached an agreement on this arrangement, and the court declared the mediation successful."</p>

<h3>Apprehension of Robbers and Seizure of Handguns</h3>
<p>Hua Detective Chief Su Changsheng of the Yulin Road Police Station apprehended a robber named Wang Yuezhi, a native of Chongming, at approximately 4:30 PM the day before yesterday near Huade Road and Huasheng Road. Upon interrogation, he learned that his accomplices, Cao Asi, also from Chongming, and Lu Chuanming from Haimen, were waiting inside a teahouse at No. 393 Huade Road. They secretly proceeded to the address and arrested Cao and Lu. Wang confessed that the firearms were hidden in the kitchen shed of house No. 2 Baishou Lane, Huasheng Road. They went to the house and found Teng Yan, a woman from Haimen. When asked where the firearms were hidden, she pointed to a vegetable basket. Detective Su seized two handguns wrapped in a blue handkerchief and twenty-eight bullets. He brought them, along with Madam Teng Yan and Wang Yuezhi, to the police station. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin recounted the events, stating that the investigation revealed that the defendants were planning to rob the property of a milk stall on Huasheng Road. The handguns belonged to Chen Cailang, a friend of Wang Yuezhi, who committed robbery in Pudong and fled to Shanghai with the guns to evade the authorities' strict pursuit. They had previously gathered at a teahouse near the Xieqiao Bridge in the Old West Gate to discuss the plan. Wang Yuezhi and Chen Cailang were arrested near the milk stall while scouting for escape routes. Chen was resourceful and managed to escape. He requested an extension for a detailed investigation. The firearms and bullets were presented for inspection. Judge Wu Zehan questioned each defendant and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further review at a later date.</p>
<h3>Intention to Commit a Crime: Possession of Military Firearms and Ammunition Leads to Conviction</h3>
<p>Wang Runhe and Huang Guangqi, Hua Detectives of the Hongkou Police Station, apprehended a man named Lu Xiaodao from Tongzhou at the Hongyun Hotel, No. 564 Haining Road, and confiscated a handgun and five bullets. Lu confessed that the handgun was given to him by his master (i.e., the "Old Man") Zhang Hongtao, with instructions to wait near Jiaxing Road and kill his enemy, Er Huzi. Subsequently, a suspect named Xie Shuihong was apprehended. It was found that Xie and Lu were involved in the theft of property worth 258 yuan from Chen Wenxiang at No. 743 Tiantong Road and Qian Boqing at No. 10 Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road, between November 8th and 12th. They were escorted to the First Special District Court. Both defendants completely denied the robbery, and the victims could not identify them. They were ordered to be remanded in custody for a later date. Knowing that escape was difficult, Zhang Hongtao surrendered himself to the police station with a lawyer and was sent to the Third Criminal Court along with Lu Xiaodao for interrogation. The facts were clarified, and a sentencing date was set. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the court and sentenced Lu Xiaodao and Zhang Hongtao to six months of imprisonment for possessing military firearms and ammunition with the intention of committing a crime. The number of days of pre-trial detention was deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. Lu Xiaodao was acquitted of the other charges, and Xie Shuihong was acquitted of all charges. Police lawyer Zhang waived the right to appeal, and they were immediately released.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Medhurst Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 6:00 PM, seven robbers suddenly arrived at the residence of a certain family at No. 22 Ruian Lane, Medhurst Road, in the Public Concession. The robbers wore blue and black long and short robes, six of them carried handguns, and one unarmed robber stood guard at the back door. After entering the house, they drove the entire family into one room, shouting loudly and demanding the keys. One robber guarded them with a gun while the others searched the rooms, opening trunks, wardrobes, and dressing table drawers. After about an hour, the robbers fled with their loot. The victims then gained their freedom and rushed to check each room, finding everything in a mess. Old and worn clothes were discarded on the floor. Jewelry, better clothes, and cash were stolen, resulting in significant losses that were difficult to calculate immediately. The incident was reported to the Xinzha Police Station, requesting an investigation. The police immediately dispatched detectives to investigate and inquired about the appearance of the robbers before returning to the police station and sending detectives to pursue them in all directions.</p>
<h3>Shi Shulian's Death Confirmed as Caused by Tram Collision</h3>
<p>– Judge Personally Inspects the Scene of the Accident – Shi Shulian, a 16-year-old from Danyang, had recently been working as a messenger substitute at the Asiatic Petroleum Company on Avenue Edward VII. At approximately 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, he was riding a rickshaw No. 9296, intending to go to the General Post Office at the bridgehead of Sichuan Road. Unexpectedly, near the Zha Pu Road Bridge on North Suzhou Road, the south side of the road was under repair, forcing Shi to ride on the tram tracks on the north side. At that moment, tram B-24, driven by Chen Ruhang, was speeding towards him. Shi saw it but could not avoid it and was knocked down, sustaining severe head injuries. A Chinese policeman on duty at post No. 196 saw the accident and immediately sent the injured Shi to Tongren Hospital, where he died shortly after. The Hongkou Police Station received the report and instructed Detective Liang Junshan to investigate. The body was then taken to the forensic examination office on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Junqing, appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Wei and clerk Wang Xiangyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. According to the report from Chinese policeman No. 196, "On that day, I was on duty at that location. I saw the tram traveling very fast. Because the road was under repair at this location, I immediately signaled to the driver, ordering him to drive slowly. However, he did not listen, resulting in this accident. The deceased is indeed the correct person." Chen Ruhang stated that he was driving the tram and saw the rickshaw only eighteen yards away, so he could not brake in time. His other statements were evasive. To clarify the truth, Mr. Zhang, accompanied by the Western police chief, personally inspected the scene of the accident before returning to the forensic examination office. He ruled that the deceased, Shi Shulian, male, died from injuries sustained after being struck by tram No. 24. The body was handed over to his father, Shi Fengchi, to be taken back for burial after signing a statement.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Sir, I have just read in today's edition of your newspaper's local news section the article "Daguan Yuan Bathhouse's Chang Yuting Was Scared and Extorted by His Nephew-in-Law with Traitorous Leaflets." The article states that Chang Yuting and Wu Suqing suddenly disagreed and requested separation. Wu then visited lawyer Chen Chou and assistant Yang Guosheng to discuss the matter, negotiated with Chang, and as a result, Chang paid 800 yuan as the cost of separation. After reading this, I was very surprised. Upon investigation, our law firm has no staff member with the title of "assistant," nor is there anyone named Yang Guosheng. Furthermore, our lawyer has never handled the Chang-Wu separation case. The information in your newspaper is probably based on inaccurate rumors. I am writing to request that you make a correction as soon as possible. Sincerely, Chen Chou, Lawyer, December 16.</p>
<p>Sir, I have read the article "Cotton Industry Association's Dissatisfaction with the Evaluation of Cotton Standards" in today's edition of your newspaper's city news section. After investigation, it does not conform to the facts and should be corrected to avoid confusion. Sincerely, Shanghai Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange, December 16.</p>
<p>Sir, A market clerk recently found a wallet in the market, containing business cards and other items, as well as a pen and key. If anyone has lost it, please contact the general office on the third floor of our market to claim it. Please publish this in the letters to the editor column. Sincerely, Shanghai Central National Products Market, December 16.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Inspects Shanghai Universities Six University Reports Will Be Issued Immediately</h3>
<p>The inspection reports of Xie Shuying, section chief of the Ministry of Education, Chen Kezhong, director of the Translation and Compilation Bureau, and Zhang Shaozhong, professor of Zhejiang University, on the inspection of six universities in Shanghai, including Hujiang, Jinan, Daxia, Datong, and Guanghua, have been formulated by the members and submitted to the Minister for approval.

<h3>Recent Situation of Mongolian and Tibetan Education in the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>After the Mongolian-Han bilingual elementary school Chinese textbooks from the first to fourth volumes, and the short-term elementary school textbooks (applicable to popular schools) first volume, were printed by the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department of the Ministry of Education, they have been sent to various Mongolian leagues and banners and Xinjiang. The ones sent to Qinghai have now arrived. The drafts of the second, third, and fourth volumes of this short-term textbook have been compiled, but they have not been printed due to limited funding. As for the situation of Mongolian and Tibetan education, in addition to the specialized schools in Beiping, the Central Political School here has changed the Mongolian and Tibetan class to the Mongolian and Tibetan School, and plans to run a normal class in addition to the high school class in the next semester to train teachers for Mongolian and Tibetan elementary schools.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Issuing Donation for Education Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>Manila Dispatch The expenses of more than a dozen local Chinese schools are managed by the Overseas Chinese Education Association. The recurring expenses of the schools are 2% of the business tax of the Philippine government plus additional donations. The other schools all have special groups or theatrical performances to raise funds. It is still easy to maintain with a small number of students. The four schools under the jurisdiction of the Education Association have 2,000 students and need 50,000 yuan per year. Five or six years ago, the overseas Chinese business was smooth and could still be offset, but in recent years, business has declined, the additional donations are less, and there are even more people who refuse to pay, resulting in increasingly serious losses for the schools. After discussions between the Education Association and the leaders of the Overseas Chinese community, it was decided to issue lottery tickets to subsidize education funding. The Philippine government recognizes that lottery tickets have a gambling nature and strictly prohibits their issuance. However, because of the lack of funding, it did not object. The lottery tickets are named Donation for Education Lottery Tickets. The first phase will issue 50,000 tickets, each sold for one Philippine silver dollar, and 22,400 yuan will be used as prizes. The balance, after deducting the cost of issuance, will be used to subsidize education funding. The winning numbers will be based on the numbers drawn in the third phase of the National Government Aviation Lottery Tickets.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Jinan Alumni Association's Newly Elected Executive and Supervisory Committee Inaugural Declaration</h3>
<p>▲Pledging Full Force to Expel the Vermin Destroying the Alma Mater The Shanghai Alumni Association of National Jinan University issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "Our association has been established for many years. Through the efforts of successive committee members and the support of alumni, it has achieved considerable success. We, the undersigned, are honored to have been elected by the general meeting to serve as members of the Executive and Supervisory Committee for the 22nd year. We are deeply conscientious in carrying on the past and opening up the future. We believe that our association is located in Shanghai, a city that connects China and foreign countries and is also the location of our alma mater. Considering the advantageous position we are in, although we do not formally bear the name of the general association, we cannot shirk our responsibility as the chief representatives. We dare not be insincere in fulfilling our obligations. Regarding the future promotion of association affairs, we would like to state the following before our fellow alumni and members of society:</p>
<p>(1) To raise funds for a fixed association venue to facilitate communication and reception among alumni. This is a major undertaking and requires the collective efforts of all our alumni to achieve success as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) To investigate and seek relief for unemployed alumni to enable them to contribute to society and fulfill their talents, thereby demonstrating the spirit of service of our alumni.</p>
<p>(3) To pledge full force to expel the vermin destroying the alma mater. Recently, unscrupulous individuals have spread rumors and slanders against our alma mater at every turn, and even sneaked into the campus to stir up trouble. Taking advantage of the tense situation, they intend to subvert our alma mater, with unfathomable intentions. We pledge to use all our strength to expel them. (A gentleman should fight with the devil; man does not live by bread alone.) We respectfully regard this as our guiding principle.</p>
<p>(4) To contribute opinions to the alma mater. The president, in his declining years, has sacrificed his spirit and material resources for the school. All our alumni should adopt a bright attitude, exhaust the wisdom of fools, concentrate opinions in this association, and contribute to the cause. This is also a help to consolidate the alma mater.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the major points. Other matters are still under consideration and cannot be described in detail. Our abilities are limited, and we hope that our alumni will provide guidance at any time to correct our shortcomings. At the beginning of our term, we hereby declare. Executive Committee of the Shanghai Alumni Association of National Jinan University, 22nd Year: Sun Yue, Yu Shaowu, Liu Wangsu, Li Bangshu, Kang Laiwen, Wu Baojin, Lin Qingchi, Ran Bingheng, Ping Zuren, Rao Zhuhua, Wen Wanyao. Supervisory Committee: Wang Weixun, Long Ziqiang, Wei Zhenhua, Chen Xiwu, Zeng Yifu, Jiang Shanjing, Wang Shanlu.</p>

<p>A letter from the Tongji Vocational School Protection Association states: "We recently read in the education section of your newspaper on the 14th of this month an article titled (Li Junnuo Comes to Shanghai Without Investigating Tongji Vocational School). According to Mr. Li's original letter, 'I came to Shanghai this time entirely to handle family affairs. I have not received any orders from the central government, nor have I investigated Tongji.' We were very surprised to read this. On the morning of the 11th of this month, someone did come to our school to investigate, carrying business cards that read 'Li Junnuo (character Huabai), cadre of the Youth Section of the Central People's Movement Committee, from Taishan, Guangdong' and 'Central People's Movement Committee.' As to whether this Li Junnuo is the same person as the Li Junnuo who issued the correction letter, and whether someone is falsely using his name, our school does not know. Hu Qinye of our association is responsible for inquiring with a member of the Central People's Movement Committee. Once we have the facts, we will announce them publicly to dispel doubts and avoid hindering the future of our school's protection. We are sending this special letter to your education section, requesting that it be published as is in the letter column to await the facts."</p>

Currently, the internal work has been largely completed and can be temporarily suspended. Furthermore, the Shanghai Dongya Sports College submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to send personnel to supervise the graduation examinations to be held from the 27th to the 29th of this month. The Ministry of Education dispatched Inspector Hao to go. Hao took advantage of this period to inspect the sports of various schools in Shanghai and decided to come to Shanghai tomorrow (the 18th) to inspect the sports of various sports colleges and public and private schools in Shanghai with the best or relatively deficient sports facilities, and conduct random checks. He will also supervise the sports administration and sports teaching of various schools. It is reported that the inspection period is about ten days, and he will return to Beijing on the 30th after the Dongya Sports College examination is completed.</p>
<h3>A Major Disturbance: Victory Decided by Penalty Kick; Jinan Defeats Jiaotong 1-0; Jiaotong University Students Beat Referee After the Match</h3>
<p>A Shout and Shen Huichun is Seriously Injured The football teams of Jinan and Jiaotong Universities met yesterday at the Jiaotong University stadium in Xujiahui. This was one of the most important matches for Jiangda Football, and the outcome was related to the loss of the championship. In addition to the students of the two schools, many football fans in Shanghai went to watch it. The two teams were evenly matched. Jiaotong conceded a penalty kick not long after the start, and Jinan won 1-0. As a result, a few Jiaotong students, unable to bear the frustration of defeat, blamed referee Shen Huichun. With a shout to hit him, Mr. Shen was immediately surrounded, and fists and flagpoles were used in conjunction, causing serious injuries. The order was greatly disrupted, which is a great misfortune for the Jiangda Sports Association. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Beating the Referee</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University is the most prestigious university in the country, but football matches at Jiangda have repeatedly experienced disturbances. Jinan had also been assaulted during a match at Jiaotong two years ago, the reason being Jinan students stealing the ball. Yesterday, Jinan went to Jiaotong to fight again, and the situation was quite peaceful, so it was thought that there would be no more storms. Unexpectedly, after the end of the match, Jiaotong students, because they had only lost a single penalty kick, were very unhappy and caused a major disturbance of beating the referee. The flagpoles and megaphones of the cheering squad were used as weapons. At that time, the whole stadium was in chaos. Poor Shen Huichun suffered an unfortunate event, and Jiaotong players did not come forward to mediate. Fortunately, a few officials rescued him and escorted him into the gymnasium. The reporter wanted to enter to visit the beaten Mr. Shen, but was blocked by a doorman, and the negotiation was ineffective. Therefore, Mr. Shen's injuries are unknown.</p>
<h3>Sighing About It</h3>
<p>Football matches at Jiangda have been plagued by disturbances over the years, and referees have been unwilling to take on the role. After the assurance of the Jiangda Sports Association and the authorities of various schools, members of the Chinese Sports Referees Association agreed to serve as referees for Jiangda matches again. Unexpectedly, as soon as the two sides joined hands, more problems arose, and yesterday's situation was particularly serious. After the match was over, Jinan players kicked the ball into the Jinan student stands, and some Jiaotong students rushed up to grab the ball, while some players chased and beat the referee. Later, the ball was taken back by the Jiaotong students, and Shen Huichun was surrounded by the crowd and suffered a beating. The situation was very scary. After Mr. Shen was escorted into the gymnasium by the protectors, the reporter was unable to find out what Mr. Shen was beaten or injured. The armed comrades were on the scene, unable to suppress the situation. Last year, Chen Jixiang was beaten at Fudan, and the negotiation took nearly half a year. Yesterday, Shen Huichun repeated the mistake. Referees are indeed not easy to do. Moreover, the beating disturbances that have occurred in recent years have all originated from the Jiangda Sports Association. The spirit of university sports in the competition has still failed to get on the right track. How can the Jiangda Sports Association, which includes the eight universities of Beijing and Shanghai and specializes in promoting university sports, comfort itself, and what about the Chinese Sports Referees Association and the members of the Referees Association who were beaten? As for the excitement of knowledgeable groups, if it is used to resist Japan and save the country, then China can be saved.</p>
<h3>Misleading</h3>
<p>The scenery of the football field is the same every year, and there is nothing to describe. Jiaotong had a drum team and a cheering squad on the scene to cheer and cheer, while Jinan only had more than a hundred students on the scene to watch. The slogans and flags were very simple. A banner with the words "Good Luck to Nanyan" was hung on the second floor of the gymnasium, and the four characters "(Bless Nanyang)" were hung on the top of the clock. There was also one on the top of the library, but the words have been forgotten. The most conspicuous thing in front of the school gate is (victory or defeat is not related to honor or disgrace), but such a conspicuous banner cannot live up to its name, and it has caused a disturbance of beating the referee. It is too (humorous).</p>
<h3>Penalty Kick</h3>
<p>The situation in the match was quite polite. The referee's enforcement was fair and without any problems. The linesmen were also appointed by the sports referee to be Liang Wendong and Lu Xiangqian to assist. Jiaotong kicked off first, and both sides had dangerous moments back and forth. However, ten minutes into the match, Jinan's right winger Yin Guiyi sent a high ball to the front of the Jiaotong goal. Xu Yahui rushed up to respond, but before the ball arrived, Jiaotong's Shen Guanlan had tripped Xu. The referee ruled that Jiaotong had conceded a penalty kick, which was kicked in by Xu Yahui. Unexpectedly, this ball was the key to victory or defeat. Afterwards, neither side gained anything, and Jinan won 1-0.</p>
<h3>Brief Description of Football Skills</h3>
<p>Jinan's forwards are not as good as Jiaotong's, but their legs are very fast, which is something that Jiaotong lacks. Gu Shangxiang is indeed the hero of Jinan, taking care of everything and making no mistakes. He has the concept of one man guarding the pass, and ten thousand men cannot pass. In times of crisis, Mr. Gu turned danger into safety. Chen Zhenxiang also worked very hard. Goalkeeper Ye Peichu is extraordinarily strong and saved many dangerous balls. In terms of defense, Jinan is better than Jiaotong. However, Jiaotong's Wang Changying is indeed powerful. Jiaotong was able to avoid losing more goals because of this gentleman. Shen Guanlan in the center is slow to move, and the ball is often snatched away by the opponent when it reaches his feet. The forward line lacks goal-scoring talents, and the attack is more frequent than Jinan, but the shots are all off target. Otherwise, it would not be difficult to reverse the situation.</p>

<h3>A Quiet Day in the Garden; You You Barely Beats Western Merchants - Three to Two -</h3>
<p>▲The Performance of Both Sides Was Ordinary and Unremarkable</p>
<p>▲Although Old, Western Merchants Can Still Rally At Times The west wind was hunting, and the sun was pale yellow. Yesterday, Western Merchants and You You met in the Yiyuan Garden for a Group A match. Fewer than 300 people went to watch, and the scene was very bleak. The performance of both sides was also very negligent. As a result, You You barely won by a score of three to two. The battle situation is described below:</p>
<h3>Zang Lai Scores</h3>
<p>When three o'clock arrived, the two teams chose their doors and then started the battle. You You fought westward against the sun. The Western Merchants forwards constantly harassed the You You territory. Jiang Shanjing did his best and saved several dangerous balls. Sun Tui-leg was lackluster and missed three good opportunities. Time passed quickly, like a white colt passing through a gap. At thirty-five minutes, the Western Merchants sent troops to spy. Although Zhuang Shihong had entangled with Stok twice, it was ineffective. Mr. Shi passed a foot in the distance, and Maolai got it and turned around to sweep the shot and scored first.</p>
<h3>Qiaosheng Turns It Around</h3>
<p>After losing a goal, You You's forwards began to improve slightly. However, the Western Merchants' center army, the inter-port tiger general Stoke, was the last line of defense, guarded by General Fapeng. Although Sun Tie-leg had the courage of ten thousand men, it was difficult to display his skills. Suddenly, Li Shiyou dribbled the ball to attack, and Xue Wu could not stop him. Kelisitai welcomed the encirclement and grabbed the ball, but it was intercepted by Mr. Sun in the middle and transferred to Qiaosheng. With a bang, Gu Tejing was caught off guard, and the autumn colors were evenly divided. After a short battle, Lemon came on the field, and both sides rested.</p>
<h3>Shutang is Penalized</h3>
<p>After changing positions in the second half, You You still showed no improvement. The forwards were very scattered and repeatedly missed good opportunities at close range. Sun Tie-leg shot at the goal, but it was five inches off. Chen Jiaqiu was also near the penalty spot and could not make a decisive decision. Western Merchants had suffered many disasters but were able to survive. They felt that their courage had suddenly increased. Fu Luosi dribbled the ball to the baseline and passed it to the center to catch and shoot at the door. Liang Shutang acted carelessly and unfortunately kissed the ball skin with his hand and was penalized with a penalty kick. Stok took the penalty and scored a goal, and the Western Merchants took the lead again with a score of two to one.</p>
<h3>Final Victory</h3>
<p>Sun Jinshun's anger and resentment overflowed his eyebrows in this adversity. Liang Shutang was also eager to make up for his mistake and switched with Jiaqiu. The forwards suddenly became active. Stoke sighed that he could not take care of everything. Lao Huang got the ball and retreated to give way to Tie Tui to go straight in. Gu Tejing's soul was not attached to his body and ran out to save the danger. Sun Jinshun's division once again made it a draw. Five minutes later, Liang Shutang, who was very ambitious, dribbled the ball deep and passed it into the middle. Zhong Yongsen was waiting to shoot, but was forced into a corner kick by the Ke defender. Qiaosheng opened the kick, and Zhong Yongsen made a great contribution in the industry. After that, You You had several fierce shots, but unfortunately none of them hit the target, and the game ended.</p>

Fortunately, Dai Linjing returned to the country to serve, and the morale was boosted. At 3:00 PM this afternoon, Donghua will play against Lux in Group A at the baseball field. Although Donghua is not healthy, it is still in good spirits and can fight. Who will win, there must be a fierce competition. The Donghua line is announced as follows.

<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Secondary School Football and Basketball Tournament: Jinling and St. John's Split Two Championships</h3>
<h3>Football: Jinling Defeats St. John's to Retain Championship</h3>
<h3>Basketball: St. John's Defeats Jinling to Remain Hegemon</h3>
<p>- Two Runner-up Finals Tomorrow -</p>
<p>(Suzhou, 16th Dispatch) The results of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Secondary School Football and Basketball Tournament, Jinling and St. John's Double Championship Finals: Jinling retained the football championship, defeating St. John's three to zero; St. John's retained the basketball championship, defeating Jinling forty-one to twenty-seven. In the matches for the runner-up, Taowu defeated Cuiying in football, and Shanghai defeated Yancheng in basketball. The runner-up finals will be held tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Football Final: Jinling Retains Championship</h3>
<p>Jinling's three to zero victory over St. John's: The football final between Jinling and St. John's was held at 1:00 PM yesterday. Jinling won three to zero to retain the football championship. The strengths of both sides were not significantly different; however, Jinling's forwards had a smooth connection, while St. John's center backs and forwards could not coordinate seamlessly. Every time the ball penetrated deep into Jinling's territory, the forwards were still catching up, missing many good opportunities. Xu Wenkui's missed penalty kick in the first half was also a fatal blow for St. John's, ultimately losing the championship by three to zero. The details of the match are recorded below:</p>
<h3>St. John's Surrounded on All Sides</h3>
<p>After the start of the match, Jinling launched an offensive, with five forwards attacking near the right, and St. John's was surrounded on all sides. Fortunately, Dong Anbang's composure was commendable, safeguarding their territory. Jinling's Chen Shikai and Lin Jianxue made two wonderful shots, both saved by Dong. He Xuequan's passes were effective, and Zhang Wenzhi could not intercept them. Chen Shikai's long shots left St. John's defense empty, creating many dangerous situations. Fortunately, Sun Baoshan rushed back to save the day, turning danger into safety.</p>
<h3>A-kui Misses a Good Opportunity</h3>
<p>After St. John's weathered the storm, Xu Wenkui, Chen Huitang, and Liu Mingde advanced in connection, causing some panic in Jinling. Zhao Ai touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick taken by Xu Wenkui, but it was too inaccurate and saved by Weng Liqian. St. John's missed this good opportunity and tried to salvage the situation, launching another attack. Jinling was caught in wave after wave of attacks. Hu Chengji's cross was effective, and Zhou Lixian's header created an opportunity for St. John's. Ye Deming took the opportunity to shoot, but it was blocked by the post. St. John's missed two good opportunities and could not help but panic.</p>
<h3>Blacky Succeeds in One Stroke</h3>
<p>Jinling attacked, and Gong Desheng dribbled forward. Zhang Wenzhi should not have conceded a corner kick. Gong Desheng took the corner kick, and the landing point was excellent. Chen Shikai deliberately missed the touch, and Lin Jianxue calmly shot into the goal. Dong Anbang was unable to save it. Jinling thus won the first half by one to zero.</p>
<h3>St. John's Loses Another Goal</h3>
<p>Switching sides to resume the battle, Jinling tried to defend. Blacky retreated to the center back position. St. John's was eager to retaliate, and their defense could not help but become empty. Gong Desheng lobbed the ball into the middle. Xu Guangyao and Deng Minghai jumped to head the ball, but to no avail. Zeng Yulong launched an attack, penetrating the defense and scoring directly. Jinling led by two to zero.</p>
<h3>Zu Xiu Determines the Outcome</h3>
<p>Although St. John's counterattacked, the forward She was slow and ineffective. Jinling's momentum grew stronger. He Xueyao ran swiftly and passed effectively. St. John's defenders did not return in time and could not defend. Dong Anbang rushed out to intercept the ball, leaving the goal empty. Zu Xiu shot, but it was too high. After this scare, He Xueyao ran with joy, and Zhou Cheng could not stop him. He Xueyao made a high cross, and Liu Zuxiu rushed forward and scored. The outcome was decided, and St. John's suffered a惨败 (惨敗, terrible defeat) of three to zero. Jinling thus retained the championship.</p>
<p>▲Jinling Lineup: Gong Desheng, He Xuequan, Chen Shikai, Zhou Lixian, Lin Jianxue (down), Lin Jianxue (up) Weng Liqian, Zheng Shaowei, Liu Zuxiu, Zhao Aisheng, Zeng Yulong (up), Zeng Yulong (down), He Xueyao</p>
<p>▲St. John's Lineup: Wu Chengji, Deng Minghai, Zhou Cheng, Chen Yaotang, Dong Anbang, Sun Baoshan, Liu Mingde, Xu Guangyao, Zhang Wenzhi, Xu Wenkui, Ye Deming</p>
<h3>Basketball Final: St. John's Retains Championship</h3>
<p>St. John's defeated Jinling forty-one to twenty-seven: After competing for the championship on the football field, Jinling and St. John's competed for hegemony in the basketball court. St. John's had smooth coordination, and their attacks and defenses were well-disciplined. Jinling's bold and decisive style was unique.</p>
<h3>St. John's Takes a Clear Lead</h3>
<p>St. John's Chen Huitang took the lead with two points in the chaos. Zhang Peixin scored from long range, taking a four to zero lead. Chen Huitang missed a free throw. Jinling's Ma Dage made a long pass to Gong Desheng, who was lurking under the basket, and successfully scored, making it four to two. Jinling trailed by two points. Li Mingguang's long shot missed, but Xu Wenkui jumped to tip the ball in, scoring another two points. Chen Huitang launched an attack in the middle, scoring two out of two shots. Gong Desheng pulled back two points. St. John's led by fourteen to four.</p>
<h3>Jinling Tries Hard to Catch Up</h3>
<p>After a timeout, Jinling's Blacky went on a solo run, and Gong Desheng added the finishing touch, scoring four consecutive points in an instant. St. John's called for a timeout, but could not escape. Gong Desheng scored another point from the air, and Chen Shikai made another free throw, making it fourteen to eleven. Jinling trailed by three points. Xu Tiankui skillfully avoided Chen Shikai and went straight to the basket, scoring two points. A-kui repeated the same trick, but Chen Shikai used too much force, and Xu earned two free throws. Tong Yuchun scored from long range. St. John's led by twenty-two to eleven. Jinling's Lin Blacky ran quickly to the basket, and Ma Qingyuan launched an attack from the left. St. John's won the first half by twenty-two to fifteen.</p>
<h3>St. John's Soars Straight Up</h3>
<p>During the break, the football players from both sides cheered and supported their teams, creating a novel atmosphere, much like a competition, which was quite a sight to see. As the battle resumed, St. John's Xu Wenkui quickly scored four points. Jinling's Lin Jianxue secretly passed the ball twice and succeeded, making the situation equal, with each side scoring. St. John's Sun Baoshan was brought in, and Chen Huitang was even more powerful. Xu Wenkui got assistance from left and right, and Zhang Peixin secretly passed the ball, causing the score to soar. St. John's defeated Jinling forty-one to twenty-seven, retaining the championship. ▲St. John's: Fouls, Points ▲Jinling: Fouls, Points Xu Wenkui (forward): 1, 18 Gong Desheng (forward): 0, 12 Sun Baoshan (forward): 0, 0 Lin Jianxue (forward): 1, 10 Li Mingguang (forward): 2, 2 Ma Qingyuan (center): 2, 4 Chen Huitang (center): 1, 12 Zheng Yingxi (guard): 3, 0 Tong Yuchun (guard): 0, 3 Chen Shikai (guard): 2, 1 Zhang Peixin (guard): 0, 6 Total: 4, 41 Total: 8, 27 First Half: St. John's 22 points, Jinling 15 points Second Half: St. John's 19 points, Jinling 12 points</p>
<h3>Football and Basketball Runner-up Finals</h3>
<p>▲Football: Taowu Defeats Cuiying: The Taowu and Cuiying teams, hungry, embarked on their campaign at 11:15 AM. Their spirits were not weak. Going back and forth, neither side had the advantage. Later, Cuiying's left inner defender Shen Yongnian committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was scored by Taowu's Chen Zhengen. The first half then came to an end. In the second half, neither side made any progress. As a result, Taowu won the runner-up final spot by one to zero and will compete with St. John's for the second place.</p>
<p>▲Basketball: Shanghai Defeats Yancheng: The runner-up final between Shanghai and Yancheng was held at 7:30 PM. After the start of the match, Shanghai passed the ball several times, and Yang Yuanqi scored under the basket, opening the scoring. Dai Guangjin changed the color, making it two to two. Yang Yuanqi scored one out of one free throw, making it five to two. Yang Yuanqi scored three consecutive times, and Huang Lifu also scored. Zhang Zhihong and Dai Guangjin pulled back four points, and the score was once again close. Shanghai was indeed extraordinary, and Huang Lifu was particularly agile. Although Yancheng felt not weak and followed closely, Shanghai always led. At the end of the first half, Shanghai won nineteen to thirteen. In the second half, Yancheng's momentum suddenly changed. Shanghai suffered another misfortune when Zhu Peisheng was also fouled out. Yancheng took the opportunity to attack, and the score was once again caught up to eighteen to twenty-one. On the field, Shanghai's Huang Lifu and Yang Yuanqi made contributions one after another, scoring repeatedly. Yancheng's momentum was perhaps at the end of its rope. Shanghai thus won the runner-up final spot by thirty-six to twenty-five.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting, Xu Shiying, and Others Agree to Hold Charity Football Matches to Aid Disaster Relief</h3>
<h3>Due to Conflicting Schedules, Various Association Football Matches Are Scheduled.</h3>
<h3>It is Estimated That Disaster Relief Efforts Must Wait Until Next Year. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, and philanthropists Wang Yiting and Du Yuesheng, considering the severe disaster situation in various areas affected by the Yellow River flood, jointly sent a letter to Wang Rutang and others a few days ago, proposing to the Chinese Athletic Association to hold football matches to aid disaster relief. Yesterday, Mr. Wang contacted the Association, stating that the time and location of various football matches this year have already been scheduled, and it is estimated that disaster relief efforts must wait until next year. The original letter is recorded below: (Respected Sirs, We recently received your letter instructing us to propose holding football matches to aid disaster relief. We have already contacted the Chinese Athletic Association. As this matter concerns public welfare, we will certainly comply. However, as the schedule of various football matches this year has already been arranged, the time and location cannot be added. It is estimated that we will have to wait until next year to begin the arrangements. We are currently preparing to convene a board meeting to make a decision. We are sending this reply in advance. Sincerely, Jingren, Yiting, Yuesheng, Xiaolai, Wenliu, Shaojue, Haian, Hanzhi, Sirs, Wang Zhengting respectfully.) It is said that after receiving the letter, Mr. Xu and others immediately sent a letter to Mr. Wang expressing their gratitude.</h3>
<h3>Yesterday Evening's Xiqing Basketball Match: Xia Guang Loses to Pirates</h3>
<p>Allied Nations Team Defeats Qing Guang: Yesterday evening's Xiqing basketball match had seven matches scheduled to begin at 3:00 PM. However, Shanghai High School Affiliated to Shanghai University, due to attending the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Secondary School Football and Basketball Tournament in Suzhou, could not return in time and therefore forfeited the match. The Dare-to-Die team in Group A also forfeited (it was found that this team had forfeited twice, and all subsequent matches were completely cancelled). Therefore, only five matches remained. The match between Xia Guang and Pirates in Group A was quite watchable. Xia Guang, after being instructed by Carlsen, had very good tactics, posing a major threat to Pirates. The last match, between Allied Nations Team and Qing Guang, was also a very interesting match. The results of each group are as follows: Team Name, Group, First Half, Total Result, Mai Ling Defeats Mei Guang, B3, 24-10, 48-20, Tax Special Wins Shanghai Middle, B3, Shanghai Middle Forfeited, 2-0, Wing Team Wins Philippine Team, B3, 21-9, 47-20, Flying Rainbow Defeats Tongwen, B1, 28-6, 56-25, Pirates Defeats Xia Guang, A, 20-12, 43-20, Shanghai Defeats Dare-to-Die, A, Dare-to-Die Forfeited, 2-0, Allied Nations Team Defeats Qing Guang, A, 22-12, 48-26.</p>
<p>▲Pirates Defeats Xia Guang: In the first match of Group A, Pirates versus Xia Guang, the victory or defeat was determined early on, but Xia Guang tried hard to resist and had very strict precautions. Although Pirates were fierce, they could not easily advance, so the situation was still relatively even. In the first half, Pirates led by twenty to twelve. In the second half, Pirates' Shi Guiya was replaced by Qu Lage. This person was selfish and unable to accomplish anything, making matters worse. As a result, the formation was more chaotic than before. For the first five minutes, there was a stalemate. Afterwards, Pirates' luck gradually improved. Smith and Pan Gen repeatedly made great achievements, and the score soared again. As a result, Pirates won by forty-three to twenty. ▲Pirates: Fouls, Points ▲Xia Guang: Fouls, Points Smith: 2, 8 Huang Jianfei: 0, 0 Shi Guiya: 1, 7 Zhang Renheng: 1, 4 Qu Lage: 4, 2 Chen Zhaoqiu: 1, 5 Luo Gen: 3, 10 Lin Qiren: 2, 4 Pi Lai: 2, 7 Lin Peisen: 2, 3 Tui Lou: 3, 6 Guan Dangan: 3, 1 Total: 15, 43 Guo Binglin: 1, 0 (Above) Pirates 20, Xia Guang 12 Li Desheng: 0, 3 (Below) Pirates 23, Xia Guang 8 Total: 10, 20</p>
<p>▲Allied Nations Team Defeats Qing Guang: Allied Nations Team has been full of energy recently and has won every battle. Last night, they defeated Qing Guang by forty-eight to twenty-six. Chen Xianglong washed away his previous dull state and is now as proud as a swimming dragon, making seven entries and seven exits, truly majestic. His free-throw skill is especially masterful. Yesterday, he scored a total of nine points through free throws. The Xia brothers have also regained their previous power. Qing Guang is also not weak, and Tan Dahua is as brave as ever, but the rest of the team is slightly degraded, and the empty defense is a fatal injury. Allied Nations Team led all the way, like ascending to the sky, winning the first half by twenty-two to twelve. In the second half, Allied Nations Team's Xia Zeren and Qing Guang's Chen Baoqiu Tan Dahua were both fouled out after committing four fouls, and the situation slightly eased. As a result, Allied Nations Team won by forty-eight to twenty-six. ▲Allied Nations Team: Fouls, Points ▲Qing Guang: Fouls, Points Liang Guoquan: 1, 4 Tan Dahua: 4, 12 Xu Kepei: 1, 16 Lin Jun: 0, 0 Chen Xianglong: 3, 19 Ye Kepei: 2, 1 Xu Daogeng: 0, 2 Chen Hualuo: 3, 4 Xia Zeren: 4, 0 Chen Baoqiu: 4, 2 Xu Shaozhi: 1, 4 Lu Dazhen: 0, 4 Xia Yushu: 1, 3 Qu Hongjiang: 1, 0 Total: 11, 48 Qu Xianzhu: 2, 2 (Above) Allied Nations Team 22, Qing Guang 12 Wu Shengwu: 3, 1 (Below) Allied Nations Team 26, Qing Guang 14 Total: 19, 26</p>

<h3>The Key to Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Kang Tun</p>
<p>No child doesn't like to (ask) questions; unless they are born deaf and mute. The world is full of wonders, and there are countless strange things we don't know. Any child, anywhere, anytime, all the things around us will spark our questions. But who can answer these questions one by one?</p>
<p>Not just children, even adults are often stumped by common questions. When they can't answer, they have to turn to books or ask knowledgeable people. But all the books and all the wise people can't answer all the questions in the world. So, those who love to learn tirelessly have to rely on their innate hands, senses, and brains to strive to explore the wonders of nature.</p>
<p>Little friends! At the very least, we should be able to recognize and understand the things in our daily lives. But in reality, that's easier said than done. Some scholars who study the heavens and the earth can tell you the volume, weight, and distance of planets in the sky, but they can't tell you how a bowl of rice gets to your mouth, or how a match burns into firewood.</p>
<p>We should use our eyes to see more. Not just look at the surface, but also see what's underneath. Use our minds to think more, and try to figure things out based on practical experiments. The more common and familiar things are, the more interesting, insightful, and irresistible they become as you peel them layer by layer like bamboo shoots and analyze them step by step.</p>
<h3>Dawn Bugle</h3>
<p>— Shi Yusheng</p>
<p>The bugle sound of (𠚣丫𠚣丫𠚣一) (𠚣一𠚣一𠚣丫) shattered my sleep and crushed my soul, but what I felt was not sadness or worry.</p>
<p>Ten thousand mountains, a thousand rivers. I flew over the rugged peaks, I crossed the surging angry waves; for my motherland, for my nation, go, go, go! How much heroism, how much excitement!</p>
<p>Tumbleweeds broken, grass withered, ice hard, frost white. I trampled on the thorns all over the ground, I braced my steely body; for my motherland, for my nation, kill, kill, kill! How much joy, how much generosity!</p>
<p>I couldn't help but jump up. The waning moon sprinkled threads of silver light; the dawn wind danced with the corners of my clothes.</p>
<h3>The Little Pine Tree's Fantasy</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>The little pine tree in the forest thought that its needle-like leaves were very ugly. It thought: (If my leaves were gold, that would be beautiful). The angel who took care of the trees knew what the little pine tree meant, and changed all its leaves to gold leaves that night. The next morning, the woodcutter saw the gold leaves on the little pine tree and picked them all off. The little pine tree sighed and said: (Gold leaves are not as good as tender green broad leaves). The tree angel then changed its leaves again. A little goat passed by, saw the tender leaves, and ate them all. The little pine tree thought: (Broad leaves are no good either, glass leaves must be good). The tree angel changed its leaves to glass leaves again. At night, the north wind rose, and the glass leaves were all blown off. The little pine tree regretted it and said: (No other leaves are as good as my original needle-like leaves). From then on, the little pine tree dared not indulge in wishful thinking anymore.</p>
<h3>The Role of Air</h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>Wang Er saw his mother boiling water and fanning the stove with a fan. The flames gradually rose, and after a while, the water in the pot made a sound. When he opened the lid, there were many bubbles on the surface of the water, reaching the boiling point. Wang Er's mother then tied the already burning charcoal into a jar, put the lid back on, and the charcoal went out. Wang Er saw this situation and asked his mother what the reason was for the fire starting and going out. His mother said: (Your question is very valuable. In the past, the Englishman Watt, because he saw his mother boiling water and the steam lifting the lid of the pot, was inspired and invented the steam engine, which is still used to drive trains and ships today. It can be seen that ordinary daily things contain scientific principles. People need air to live, as you know. There is a kind of oxygen in the air, which can help combustion. Fanning the stove with a fan is to send more air into the stove, so that there is more oxygen to help combustion, so the charcoal has flames. When the water has boiled, there is no need for a strong fire, so the charcoal is put into a jar and the lid is put on to isolate the air, that is, to isolate the oxygen. Without oxygen, it does not help combustion, so the charcoal goes out by itself, to be used again in the future.)</p>
<h3>Filled a Nose with Water</h3>
<p>— Xue Fan</p>
<p>My younger brother loves listening to stories the most. Once, my older sister didn't tell a story, she just spoke interestingly about the word (biology) from the textbook.</p>
<p>She said: Any kind of living thing in the world must have conditions suitable for survival, otherwise it would have been eliminated long ago. For example, the color of a grasshopper is similar to that of green grass; the color of a cicada is similar to that of tree bark. Therefore, it is difficult for children to catch them, so these colors are called protective colors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for example, each part of our human body is also suitable for survival. Just imagine if our mouths were not horizontal but vertical, wouldn't we fill our noses with water when it rained?</p>
<p>My younger brother found it very interesting and giggled.</p>
<h3>Brave Little Friend</h3>
<p>— Xing Yi</p>
<p>After the sun in the west hid its light, there were only a few sparse stars twinkling in the dark sky. The children, unafraid of the darkness, ran across the small bridge in groups! (Thump!) Suddenly, a huge whirlpool arose on the water's surface, and a child fell into the water under the bridge! (Ah! Help! Help!)</p>
<p>At this critical moment, a brave little friend, without waiting to take off his clothes and shoes, plunged into the whirlpool in one bound. The current here was originally very rapid. However, his swimming skills were also very proficient! So, amidst the clapping and cheering of many spectators and children, he actually rescued the child who had fallen in!</p>
<p>Who is this brave little friend? Let me introduce him: he is Hua Dun, a ten-year-old student at Zhajiaqiao Primary School in Wuxi.</p>
<p>1、Ming'er and Rabbit Brother were walking outside and happened to meet Mrs. Goose.</p>
<p>1、2、Mrs. Goose laid an egg for him to play with.</p>
<p>2、3、Ming'er happily took it home and asked Piggy Mom to hold the door and watch what was inside.</p>
<p>3、4、It turned out to be Mrs. Goose's son! (Made by Min Tu)</p>
<p>4、</p>
<h3>An Honest Child</h3>
<p>— Bozhen</p>
<p>Min'er is a child of eleven or twelve years old. He has a rosy face, cherry-like lips, and a pair of dark, shining eyes. He plays and moves about all day long with a smile, and is quite lovable. Honesty is his virtue; wisdom is his talent.</p>
<p>Teachers and parents all like him and praise him; therefore, he lives a comfortable and happy life. The covers of newspapers often display four large characters: What are they? They are the four characters "(Aviation to Save the Nation)," urging people to donate money generously!</p>
<p>One afternoon, around three o'clock, Min'er happily carried his schoolbag and returned home with the neighbor's children. He entered the house, greeted his parents with a respectful bow, as was his daily habit.</p>
<p>He went into his small study, put down his schoolbag, and saw a pile of newspapers on the table. His eyes fell upon those four striking characters: "(Aviation to Save the Nation)," calling on everyone to donate money, no matter how much.</p>
<p>Then, a thought flashed through his mind:</p>
<p>(During the January 28th Incident in Shanghai last year, the enemy's planes were so fierce, circling above our heads and constantly dropping large, heavy bombs. Our people died and were injured; houses were destroyed and burned; it was so heartbreaking! We should quickly donate some money to buy some airplanes to strengthen our national defense.)</p>
<p>So, he quietly walked to where his mother kept her money, took a silver dollar, and dashed to the bank that was collecting donations to donate the silver dollar.</p>
<p>The next day, his mother discovered that she was missing a dollar and asked the family if anyone had taken it. Min'er got up from his small bed, walked out of the bedroom, and truthfully confessed: (I took it. I donated it to the Aviation to Save the Nation Association. Please forgive me, Mother.) His mother, seeing his clever and lively demeanor, was no longer angry. She picked him up, kissed him, and said: (Good child, you are truly an honest child! You are also a patriotic child!)</p>
<h3>Strive for the Nation... for the Country</h3>
<p>— Xishi</p>
<p>My dear son Aihua: Since the September 18th Incident the year before last, so many of our compatriots have joined the Volunteer Army. This kind of tragic and fervent emotion has filled the land and soared into the clouds. I think you know these things in detail.</p>
<p>In my heart, I had long harbored many words to say to you, but at that time, you were still young, and I was afraid you would not understand. Now that you are a little older, and especially now with the political turmoil in Fujian Province and the situation in the north still unresolved, it is necessary for me to tell you these things.</p>
<p>Your father died in battle during the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in Nanchang. I have lived bleakly in this world for you. Although I have endured countless hardships, I have held onto a great hope in my heart and struggled until now. Aihua, do you want to know my hope? I will tell you plainly! (The only great hope I have for you is that you will follow in your father's footsteps, strive for the nation, and strive for the country.) Aihua, you do not belong to your parents' family; you belong to the nation and the country. I will never need you to be filial to me; I only hope that you will be filial to the nation and loyal to the country!</p>
<p>Your mother.</p>
<h3>Two Mistakes</h3>
<p>— Xu Zongjie</p>
<p>(I) Eating on the Road</p>
<p>When did Mom come back last night? She's still sleeping soundly now. Oh no! Class is about to start, and breakfast hasn't been made yet. What to do? I know! I'll take six copper coins from under Mom's pillow and buy a sesame flatbread and fried dough stick to munch on. Getting to class is important; I'll chew as I walk.</p>
<p>What a disaster! I ran into the teacher on the way. I couldn't swallow it down, and I couldn't hide it. I had to bite the bullet and go to school, where the teacher called me into the disciplinary office and gave me a stern lecture.</p>
<p>(II) Being Late</p>
<p>On Monday morning, I felt languid and comfortable lying in bed. How pleasant! Ding! Ding!... The clock struck nine. Oh no, this is bad! I jumped up, didn't wash my face, didn't eat porridge, grabbed my schoolbag, and ran. I arrived at school at a quarter past nine.</p>
<p>The teacher, with a livid face, asked him why he was so late. He could only say with a mournful face: (Mom took me to the Great World amusement park last night, and I went to bed late, so I couldn't get up early). The teacher snorted through his nose and gave him another lecture.</p>
<h3>The Zoo</h3>
<p>— Renwei</p>
<p>In a certain place, there is a zoo. Although its scale is not very grand, it has lions, bears, tigers, leopards, rare birds, and exotic animals of all kinds. Therefore, children love to linger in this fun place. Some like to watch mandarin ducks playing in the water; some like to listen to parrots mimicking speech; some like to watch lions eating. But this lion just dozes off all day long and has never been seen to move even once. In the cage next to the lion, there is a big bear. At first, no one paid much attention to it, but recently, it has grown bigger and bigger and can stand up and spin around, winning people's favor. So, the children all gather around the bear to play. The sleeping lion next to it is still lost in slumber, enjoying its sleep very much.</p>
<h3>Variation in Living Things</h3>
<p>— Jinxì</p>
<p>Today, I went for a walk in the countryside with my younger brother. When we came back, my brother said interestingly: (I saw that no two trees in the wild are the same.) I smiled.</p>
<p>When we got home, I asked my brother to dip his fingertips in ink and print them on white paper. He then discovered that the patterns of his ten fingerprints were all different. The whorls and loops were certainly different, but even whorl and whorl, loop and loop, were not exactly alike. At this time, I also smeared ink on my fingertips and printed them, comparing them to his fingerprints. He also noticed that the fingerprints of the two people were different.</p>
<p>Then, my brother understood the phenomenon of variation in living things.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Children's World</h3>
<p>— Wenpu</p>
<p>The Sincere Company in Shanghai recently held a Children's World Fair. The venue was located on the fifth floor, covering a large area. On both sides of the entrance, swings, slides, seesaws, and other play equipment were placed, attracting many children. In the middle, a Santa Claus was displayed, smiling kindly and lifelike. On the left and right sides of the venue, various novel toys were displayed, some related to science, some with educational significance, and the military and war-related items were particularly realistic, such as airplanes, cannons, warships, tanks, machine guns, torpedoes, submarines, and other weapons, all complete. At the far end of the venue, there were two wire cages. One cage contained a kangaroo with bright eyes, crouching in a corner. The other cage contained birds of several dozens of species, with flowers and trees planted inside and sand spread on the ground, flying and dancing among them, their singing pleasing to the ear. Next to the cages, there was a cinema showing educational films, which were clear and watchable. After the film, there was a dance performance by Little People, comical and amusing, with many people gathered around to watch. Children came and went in the venue, like butterflies flitting through flowers, making people feel love at first sight. In the center of the venue, Horlicks Company provided milk powder. I happened to be very thirsty, so I tried it with a guest. Its appeal was quite strong. Competing with Horlicks Company was the lottery area. Guests, out of curiosity, threw in a silver coin, drew a bead, and claimed a prize according to the number. They actually won a pachinko game, worth about six or seven yuan, which could be considered a small fortune. Overall, the entire venue was filled with a dazzling array of beautiful things, truly a beneficial entertainment venue for children, which is of great benefit to the enhancement of children's knowledge. The Social Affairs Bureau has approved next year as "(Children's Year)." It is hoped that the authorities of the company will expand the layout, add more programs, and extend the duration of the fair next year so that all children can enjoy themselves. It is also hoped that large commercial establishments in various places will follow suit and further allow children throughout the country to enter paradise together.</p>
<h3>Communication from Rural Little Friends</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>▲Opening</p>
<p>Dear children:</p>
<p>I am a person from the bottom of the countryside, unable to enjoy the prosperity of the city: But I am not willing to come and experience the prosperity of the city—perhaps it is also impossible? However, I would very much like to know the situation in the city. Before I can learn about the situation of the urban children, I should naturally first tell you about the original state of the countryside:</p>
<p>(Revitalizing the countryside), (reconstructing the countryside), we children are also familiar with these slogans. This must be a crucial issue; I think. Ah, fortunately! I am in an environment that has been doing rural improvement work for five years, with a very strong atmosphere of the crucial slogans that adults are shouting enthusiastically today. I have more to say about the countryside—this already improved and vibrant countryside; I will communicate with you from now on, I will report to you the scenery of the countryside, you—urban children, please also tell me about the things in the city, especially your activities!</p>
<p>——Our communication is now beginning; from now on,－</p>
<p>I wish you good health.</p>
<p>▲Understanding</p>
<p>Dear children:</p>
<p>Since that first letter was sent, it has actually increased a lot of spiritual comfort. Because when this letter reaches you, the thoughts that I have been carrying can also be known by you. One of the happiest things a person feels in the world is when people can (understand) each other. The ancients envied the (joy of mutual understanding). Especially in a world where human feelings are thin and everyone is suspicious; often a sharp knife is hidden in a smile, and a bloodless murder plot is woven into sweet words. (Understanding) each other in this world is even more precious! If society cannot (understand) each other, then there will be (bang bang pong pong), you cannon me gun, creating a smoggy atmosphere. Each of us children has a pure heart and a bright mind, which we must always maintain, maintain.</p>
<p>Let us children use our pure hearts and our enthusiasm to unite. The hearts of children all over the world are for (peace), (loving each other). Because it has already been united into a bright and shining childlike heart. What is jealousy, hatred, suspicion... these are the activities of adults, these are outside the scope.</p>
<p>Children! Remember: we are (people) who nakedly love (goodness)!</p>
<p>The end.</p>

<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>I like flying kites, on a spring day, the air in the square is fresh, raising my head and sticking out my chest is good for hygiene. I like kicking shuttlecock, exercising in winter makes blood flow smoothly, when I kick up a sweat I don't feel the cold.</p>

<h3>Commercial News Finance February Gold Standard Market Opens, High Then Low Process｜Exchange Rate US Bank Has Not Risen, Opening Still Steady｜｜Unfavorable News Once Broke Through the 700 Yuan Barrier｜</h3>
<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday, with a slightly weak trend. Overseas cables were still bad, and people's minds were also uncertain. The result in the first half of the day, calculated with added swap rates, showed the short side paying out around nine yuan, a very slight drop compared to the previous close. In the early morning, although silver markets rose in both England and the United States, the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell more than it rose, exchange rates rose and fell only slightly, London spot gold rose six pence, and US officials' purchases of newly mined gold prices remained unchanged. Stocks fell one yuan and forty-nine cents, US cotton rose six pounds, US wheat rose one and one-eighth of a cent, the wool market was relatively stable, but due to unfavorable news reports, the opening was zero point zero five yuan.

After entering, although banks bought, Reuters New York cable reported that a plan for inflationary legislation was being discussed at the inflation conference. Senators Borah and Thomas were dissatisfied with the President's failure to decisively use the privilege granted by Congress to inflate the dollar by 50%, and there were rumors of demands for immediate inflation. Peers pushed, the US exchange rate stepped hard inward, and broke through the 700 yuan barrier. It was slightly flat at noon, with the spot price being 1,075 yuan. January swapped for February at a rate of nine yuan paid out by the short side. New chips in February totaled 44 bullish and 49 bearish.

After entering, people's minds suddenly weakened, and Chinese merchants forcefully pushed, causing the US exchange rate to ease inward. Hengxing, Hengtai, Bingxing, etc., disposed of their holdings, retreating to within 1 yuan, but because Hongli, Ruikang, Yuansheng, Yong, etc., took the opportunity to buy at low prices, it was still a struggle.

Banks still bought at half a yuan for April, and Richang, Yifeng, Yongfu, Changyi, Dayong, etc., took the opportunity to buy strips, and Citibank bought US dollars for March at 25, causing the price to rise back to 700 yuan and 4 jiao.

<h3>The Relationship Between Silver Prices and China's Price Level</h3>
<p>(Continued from III) Written by Louis Zhang Lüluan</p>
<p>(IV) Can China Avoid Falling Prices?</p>
<p>In China, if a certain permanent price level is to be obtained with silver prices as the unit, and the silver-to-yuan exchange rate can be changed to offset price changes, it may not be impossible to achieve. However, when implementing this monetary system, the following points must be noted or prepared: (1) There must be at least a reliable wholesale price index that can represent most of China's situation. For example, the current Shanghai Index and North China Index represent too narrow a range.</p>
<p>(2) The amount of silver exchanged for banknotes must be changed frequently within a certain period of time. If the wholesale price index decreases by one percent, then the amount of silver that can be exchanged for each silver yuan must also decrease by one percent at the same time, so that it is the same as before the decrease. Conversely, if prices increase by one percent, the best way to offset this is to simultaneously increase the amount of silver that can be exchanged for each silver yuan by one percent at the same time, and the logic is the same as above.</p>
<p>(3) Regardless of the height or low of silver prices, various debt contracts or other guarantees can be formally concluded or fulfilled at any time, as the silver-to-yuan exchange rate moves in tandem with the height or low of prices, ensuring that both parties can profit or loss with no damage. This kind of currency standard can sometimes be called a commodity currency system, which is no different from a non-fixed silver standard. If you want a non-fixed silver standard to control the general price level in the country, then first, silver exports do not need to be restricted, and second, domestic free redemption of notes does not need to be sanctioned.</p>
<p>The price of Chinese yuan has always been based on a fixed weight of silver. If the price of silver is high, the price of goods will fall, so fixing the price level seems to be an important goal. However, increasing tariffs, heavily taxing imported goods, encouraging exports, restricting production, and estimating prices are probably all inappropriate and have little effect.</p>
<p>Since 1929, prices in gold standard countries have fallen sharply. The rulers have used many methods, such as those listed above, to fix this or that price, but none of the results have been as we wished. The way to solve the problem is to abandon the gold standard, because this can free the price of currency from being entangled with the price of gold. In the future, even if the price of gold rises, it will have nothing to do with the currency.</p>
<p>However, there are also countries in the world that are unwilling to abandon the gold standard even if their economic situation is not completely bankrupt. In the future, these countries may not be able to avoid serious social or political turmoil.</p>

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds: Demand Exceeds Supply</h3>
<p>▲ Market Prices Frequently Rise by Thirty-Four Cents to Sixty-Seven Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although trading volume was not high, market prices frequently increased. While the rise in value was not substantial, each transaction was consistently stable. Although there were no significant developments in the current situation, the central government is striving to avoid war. The Southwest's attitude, while still ambiguous, has not yet closed the door to peace. The overall situation seems to have evolved into a state of "neither peace nor war," a state of "war without fighting." It is predicted that the future will not lead to a complete breakdown. Although the market environment is not experiencing excessive volatility, any significant entry or exit can cause fluctuations due to the high barriers of deposit accounts on both sides. Yesterday's trading, though not bustling, saw prices rise again due to demand exceeding supply. From the opening bell in the morning to the closing bell in the afternoon, the market price rose by twenty-three to thirty-four cents in each transaction, exhibiting a balanced and stable trend. Major players, such as numbers 43 and 50, showed some demand, while the supply of chips on the trading floor was lacking, leading to a solid upward trend. Starting next week, the settlement period for this month is approaching rapidly. Considering the several days of market closure, which will last only six or seven days, the tendency toward squeezing positions is still inevitable. The final result of yesterday's market prices was an increase of around thirty-four cents to sixty-seven cents. The total trading volume reached six million six hundred and sixty-one thousand yuan. There were no spot transactions made open. Futures trading included two million five hundred and seventy-five thousand for unified salt tax, eight hundred and seventy thousand for troop disbandment, six hundred and eighty-five thousand for 1929 Customs bonds, one million and sixty thousand for 20-year Customs bonds, and the remainder ranged from tens of thousands to two or three hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>Holiday Approaching: New York Stock Market Trends Weak</h3>
<p>A report from the New Faithful Trading Company on the 15th stated that the New York stock market is trending weak, mainly due to the approaching holiday season. Major speculators have not participated and seem to be waiting until after the New Year to resume trading. Gold mining stocks fell slightly due to the static gold price. The House of Lords' ruling supporting the gold clause in the Belgian utility company bonds had no impact on market conditions. U.S. Treasury bonds showed slight variations. Foreign bonds were stable. Domestic bonds weakened slightly due to profit-taking by bulls. The total daily trading volume was 1.17 million shares. Additionally, the railway freight volume released today was 537,503 cars. (Wheat) rose by more than one cent; there are still many shorts. (Cotton) market conditions are stable; there are swap settlements in January. The denial of monetary stabilization and the reaffirmation of gold purchase policies offset the static gold price. The Financial Readjustment Society's purchase price of gold per tael was 34.01 yuan, unchanged. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Twenty Industrial Stocks: 99.95, down 1.49</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks: 41.45, down 0.74</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks: 23.70, down 0.43</p>
<p>Forty Bonds: 83.14, down 0.20</p>
<p>Eleven Commodities: 48.07, up 0.29</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn: Declining Trend Difficult to Reverse – Warehouse Yarn Inventory Shows No Reduction</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and weak, presenting a scene of tranquility. With the Lunar New Year approaching, all parties are currently in the process of closing accounts. As a result, yarn sales are exceptionally sluggish, leading to a lack of confidence. The yarn inventory in yarn warehouses remains difficult to reduce. Therefore, the market is extremely depressed.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market: Quiet and Weak</h3>
<p>The initial trading session for cotton yarn was quiet, and trading in the market was quite slow. Prices for all months fell by ten to twenty cents. News in the afternoon reported that spot yarn trading was quite slow. Prices for nearby months were flat, while prices for distant months fell by ten to twenty cents. The total daily trading volume was 7,150 bales. Sales included Chun Kee 750 bales, Da Feng 900 bales, De Kee 400 bales, Da Kee 300 bales, and Yuan Da 300 bales. Purchases included Chang Feng 850 bales, Tong Fu 550 bales, Ming De 400 bales, and Xin Hua 150 bales. Closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Closing Prices	Price Change	Inventory Quantity	Cotton Yarn Closing Prices	Price Change	Inventory Quantity</p>
<p>December: 17.19	Down 0.02	16,300	March: 17.72	Down 0.03	23,050</p>
<p>January: 17.41	-----	27,900	April: 17.82	-----	19,700</p>
<p>February: 17.55	-----	28,450	Total:	-----	115,400</p>
<h3>Customer Sales Less Than 300 Bales</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales were very slow, even less than before. Total purchases by various groups for the day were only 291 bales. Market prices were similar to the previous day. Purchase amounts by various groups are as follows: Nanjing 5, Shantou 10, Changsha 20, Inland 95, Guangdong 60, Fellow Traders 15, Wuhu 20, Ningbo 6, Anqing 55, Jiangxi 5.</p>
<h3>Cotton Retracing a Weak Path</h3>
<p>The cotton market is again moving toward weakness. Indian cotton prices have declined, and the yarn market is trending downwards. Credit is tightening daily, making it extremely difficult for mills. It is very difficult to procure raw materials at high prices, and there is no sign of a turnaround in overseas cotton conditions. Currently, cotton merchants in general are holding tight and not releasing their holdings, causing market sentiment to rise, but the bulls from the Ningbo group have already settled somewhat.</p>
<h3>Cotton Futures Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>The initial trading session for cotton futures saw prices decline for all months, as Indian cotton prices fell, American cotton prices were flat, and gold prices fell slightly. Prices fell by five cents to twenty cents. In the afternoon, prices for nearby months were still firm, while prices for distant months fell by a fraction. Total daily trading volume was 50,200 dan. Sales included Geng Feng 1,000 dan, Yuan Feng 2,100 dan, Da Chang Cheng 100 dan, Chang Feng 2,200 dan, Xin Hua 1,200 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 4,000 dan, Rui Yuan 1,200 dan, and Xin Cheng 2,200 dan. Purchases included Da Chang 4,700 dan, Ren Feng 1,200 dan, Shen Ji 1,800 dan, Sui Long 2,000 dan, and Yu Kang 1,500 dan. Closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Closing Prices	Price Change	Inventory Quantity	Cotton Futures Closing Prices	Price Change	Inventory Quantity</p>

<p>February: 39.55	Down 0.15	211,200	Total:	-----	821,100</p>
<h3>Spot Sales Turn Sluggish</h3>

<h3>American Cotton Mixed, British and Indian Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market was mixed. It initially rose due to positive news from Liverpool, then fell due to profit-taking by bulls. As a result, spot prices rose 5 points, and futures prices rose 3 to 6 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell 7 points, and futures prices fell 8-9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 5 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to speculative selling. As a result, Pingar and Belaro both fell 2 rupees, and Oomra fell 2.5 rupees. Original telegraph records (December 15th telegram) follow:</p>

<h3>US Domestic Consumption of American Cotton Disappointing</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 15th reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that futures trading had improved somewhat last week, but speculative interest was not stimulated. People are waiting for developments in monetary policy or the business climate after the holidays. The spot market position is quite tight, and market sentiment is very strong. However, when prices rise, supply increases slightly. When the hedging stops, the industry needs to purchase again when prices fall. Therefore, the market only fluctuates within 20 points. The domestic consumption figures for November were quite disappointing, but there was no immediate impact on the market. The demand for major commodities increased during the week. There were some transactions for delivery next spring, and prices also showed a slight increase.</p>
<h3>Sales of Shanghai Japanese-Made Yarn Increased in November</h3>
<p>Sales of Shanghai Japanese-made yarn in November totaled 40,272 bales, an increase of 4,967 bales compared to the 35,305 bales in October. Although sales to Japan, India, Southeast Asia, and Tianjin were lower in November than in October, sales to the local market, Hankou, Hong Kong, and Qingdao increased significantly. For example, there were no sales to Qinhuangdao in October, but there were sales of 389 bales in November. The following table lists the sales of Japanese-made yarn to various ports in November for reference:</p>
<p>Location	Volume in Bales	Location	Volume in Bales</p>
<p>Korea	7,523	Qingdao	1,262</p>
<p>Hong Kong	830	Qinhuangdao	389</p>
<p>Southeast Asia	302	Tianjin	5,778</p>
<p>Hankou	2,917	India	1,435</p>
<p>Japan	5,325	Shanghai	14,511</p>
<p>Total	40,272</p>
<h3>Food: Flour Futures Experience Unprecedented Plunge</h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Wheat Pricing Gradually Loosens, Low-Price Wheat Transactions Concluded</p>
<p>▲ After the opening of the flour market this morning, prices for all months suddenly experienced an unprecedented plunge. The briskness of trading and the ferocity of the price declines were truly rare. Although foreign wheat quotations were up two or three cents in Chicago and around one cent in Canada, the continuous offering of spot foreign wheat and the gradual loosening of pricing led to this situation. Initially, people felt relatively calm due to the implementation of tariffs on foreign wheat. But the market's instability was already latent. The government's wheat lending, given unfavorable foreign conditions, could no longer be dismissed. Yesterday, through Xiang Mao, one ship was sold to Fu Feng (or a rumor of two ships). The price was extremely low, as little as 4.20 yuan including tax (only 3.60 yuan excluding tax). Upon hearing this news, both factories and merchants dumped their holdings in large quantities, leading to the severe price drop. The steepest decline was in January, falling as low as 1.40 yuan, 1.075 yuan lower than the previous day. The remaining months also fell by 6, 7, 8, or 9 yuan. Later, prices rebounded one or two cents due to short covering. By the afternoon, trading slowed, and prices stabilized somewhat due to the government's wheat quotation being 1.50 yuan higher (4.35 yuan). Prices rebounded slightly by one cent. However, the atmosphere had already deteriorated, and the outlook was pessimistic. In the end, this month fell 4 cents compared to the previous day, January and February fell 5.25 cents, March fell 5 cents, and April and May fell 5.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Flour Futures Experience a Rapid Decline as Everyone Dumps Holdings</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour futures market, prices for all months saw a consistent and sharp decline. Although foreign wheat quotations were up two or three cents in Chicago and around one cent in Canada, the market was wary of spot foreign wheat. Prices were already unstable at the opening. With the drastic fall in flour prices and the unconventional easing of government wheat lending, everyone dumped their holdings at once. However, the actual volume of chips on the market was not particularly high, so the price drops were not too significant. In the afternoon, due to a certain factory short covering, the prices weakened somewhat. The remaining months were generally stable, with little trading. As a result, this month fell 0.09 yuan compared to the previous day, January fell 0.03 yuan, February and March fell 0.07 yuan, and April fell 0.06 yuan. Arrivals of spot wheat were still low. Prices also fell slightly by about 0.05 yuan due to the standard's decline. Anhui wheat was quoted at 4.20 yuan, and lower-quality wheat was quoted at 0.12 yuan, totaling 400 bags, which were handled by Fu Feng.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Tongxiang Rice Sales Active, Prices Firm</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals from various groups were obstructed by winds in the Minhang Zhagang area, so only about 20 ships (3,000+ piculs) arrived. The overall situation was similar to before. However, due to the limited amount of late rice arriving, merchants favored thick rice from Jiangsu and Tongxiang. Prices continued to increase by five cents because sellers held firm. A total of 1,500-1,600 bags of thick and thin rice were sold in the city. Business was unusually sluggish in the local street market. Initial sales of thick rice from various groups appeared to be weakening, but fortunately, the demand for rice cakes picked up, and the market stabilized. Du Yang Jian was flat, while Yinbianyuan saw no significant gains or losses.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There were arrivals of 33-34 ships from various locations. Sales were normal. White rice was slightly weak. Thin rice, Yang Du Pu Ke Xian, and prices were stable. White Yuan and Yin Yuan were slightly stronger.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Merchants Actively Purchase Merchant Rice</h3>
<p>Prices Continue to Rise by Five to Six Cents. Yesterday, merchants were very interested in Ke Xian, especially merchants from Ningbo in Eastern Zhejiang. There were also a small number of transactions involving Quanzhou in Fujian Province. However, production prices were high, costs increased, and it did not sell well in the end. Owners continued to raise prices, and prices in various grades rose by five to six cents. The market is still looking promising. After the tax on foreign rice, Ke Xian has attracted the attention of various parties. Hoarders are also searching in the production areas, further boosting the market. Yesterday, Ningbo merchants purchased 500 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed late rice, priced at 7.55 yuan, and lower-quality rice was priced at 7.38 yuan. They also purchased 200 bags of machine-processed rice, priced at 6.75 yuan. Hunan rough rice, 66 bags, priced at 6.37 yuan. Nanjing rough rice, 289 bags, priced at 5.84 yuan. Wuhu machine-processed rice, 400 bags, priced at 7.78 yuan, and lower-quality rice was priced at 7.35 yuan. Local merchants purchased 76 bags of Hunan machine-processed rice, priced at 7.55 yuan. Wuhu rice, more than 200 bags, priced at 7.78 yuan to 7.35 yuan. Jiangxi rough early rice, 1,000 bags, priced at 6.10 yuan to 5.90 yuan. Quanzhou merchants purchased 100 bags of machine-processed red rice, priced at 7.20 yuan. Jing Xian, more than 100 bags, priced at 6.58 yuan, all up five to six cents from the previous market.</p>
<h3>More Than 5,000 Boxes of German Tinplate Confirmed for Delivery</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was very active trading in German tinplate for confirmed orders. Trading was conducted by Jardine Matheson, Yih Ho, Hezhong, Lulin, and other foreign firms. The volume of confirmed orders reached more than 5,000 boxes. The price for 90-pound single-coated tinplate was 16 shillings per box, and 90-pound double-coated tinplate was estimated at 30 shillings per box. It is reported that those who confirmed their orders were mainly hardware stores along North Suzhou Road.</p>

<h3>Flowers and Leaves</h3>
<p>— Zhongfang</p>
<p>After reading the 26th installment of "Interviews with Chinese Film Artists" (which featured an interview with Mr. Hong Shen, director of "The Iron Plate Red Tears Record"), I gained a slightly clearer understanding of a pressing issue facing contemporary progressive film artists: the problem of "flowers and leaves." In the "Interview," a certain Mr. Friend’s voice is borrowed to say:</p>
<p>("...Therefore, I always think this way: I painted this flower, and I think it looks very realistic, and my personality is also expressed. But others say I still have to add a few leaves, but I don't want to add them, because I think it's unnecessary.")</p>
<p>This is an argument for: No Leaves. The interviewee, Mr. Hong Shen, believes that ("Our works just have too few leaves"). This leans towards "Wanting Leaves." And the opinion of the author of the "Interview," Mr. Sha Ji, is (a compromise). He says:</p>
<p>("Needless to say, I don't agree with using pointless gimmicks to make things interesting, but the achievement of technical vividness is still very necessary. As for poisoning the theme by being too concerned with vividness, that is naturally the most foolish thing. However, adding two green leaves to the outside of the flower to make it more realistic, and more authentic, that is the true value of art.")</p>
<p>The essence of this "Flowers and Leaves" issue is roughly as follows. Originally, there is an old Chinese saying: "However good the peony is, it depends entirely on the support of green leaves." A single peony flower is not good-looking. It must have leaves to complete the beauty of the peony. So "leaves" here are not just for decoration, but a necessary condition for completing "the beauty of the peony." Flowers and leaves are opposing, yet complementary, not one being the subject and the other the subordinate.</p>
<p>The issue of "flowers and leaves" in art should also be understood in this way. The issue is not "Do you need to add a few leaves?" or "Add two more leaves." The issue is whether those leaves are painted correctly. If chrysanthemum leaves are added next to a peony flower, making it look neither like a peony nor a chrysanthemum, then that is truly "unnecessary."</p>
<p>If the flower is a peony, and the leaves are definitely peony leaves, then even if there are too many leaves, it will not "poison the theme." Because one peony and two leaves are of course a peony, but four or five, or even seven or eight, are still a peony, and will not turn into a herbaceous peony. When the "leaves" "poison" the flower (theme), it must be because these "leaves" and "flower" are not of the same kind. So, regarding the "flower and leaf problem" in literature and art, the first thing is to recognize that flowers and leaves are mutually needed and complementary, and the leaves are not in a supporting position. The second thing is to pay attention to whether the leaves have been wrongly matched. How do Mr. Hong Shen and the other two gentlemen feel about this?</p>
<h3>The Death of Zhu Xiang</h3>
<p>— He Jiahuai</p>
<p>Zhu Xiang was a student who studied abroad, a professor, and also a poet. He could be considered to have a considerable position in society. Unfortunately, he recently jumped into the Yangtze River and died for the sake of livelihood. It is not yet clear why he committed suicide, but according to many people's speculation, poverty was indeed the biggest reason for this tragedy. I met him once in the spring of this year at the Beixin Bookstore. At that time, I didn't know who he was, I only remembered a haggard and thin face. Later, after Mr. Zhao Jingshen mentioned it, I realized that it was Zhu Xiang, and said that he had already left Anhui University, had no proper job, and was having a very difficult life. His articles have been published very little in recent years, and poems cannot be sold for money. It is a dream to want to maintain a living by this. I heard that a magazine wanted his poems, but because he asked for four yuan a line, the editor who loved to scrape oil refused to publish them in anger. Last Saturday, I ran into Mr. Du Heng at the Modern Bookstore. He said that Zhu Xiang had entrusted a friend to write a letter to him, saying that he wanted to write articles for Modern, but as a result, he never sent them. Unexpectedly, he committed suicide in such a tragic way, which really surprised him. I didn't believe it at the time. It was only after I called Mr. Zhao Jingshen yesterday that I learned that this unfortunate thing really happened.</p>
<p>It seems that there is no record of this matter in the newspapers, but it is actually very worthy of attention, because its significance is not limited to Zhu Xiang alone. It is said that this poet's temperament was very proud and he thought very highly of himself. According to his imagination, a poet like him, although he cannot have any title like a foreign poet laureate, should at least be made to live comfortably so that he has the mood to write poems. But this chaotic Chinese society not only does not give him a comfortable life, but simply does not give him a life. He naturally felt this coldness. He could not recognize the society, understand the society, did not admit that a certain environment that could tolerate him and cultivate him like flowers and plants had collapsed, and did not believe that the bright and splendid period would really be realized, so he only saw a deep darkness. This fatal despair made him have no courage to live on, and made him have to use suicide to solve the inner pain.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiang is dead, and among the large group of intellectuals who are wandering and struggling, I am afraid that there are still many candidates who will choose this dead end with him.</p>
<h3>Summer Palace of Revolution</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>The film (The Mad Knight Quixote), which is currently showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater, regardless of the criticisms it receives after viewing, already had an authority that caused a sensation in the global film industry during its production. This is because it is a masterpiece by Cervantes, a treasure of Spanish literature, with a screenplay by Paul, Morand, and directed by Basson, and is a film based on Massenet's opera, starring the world-renowned Russian singer Chaliapin, bringing together first-class talents in literature, music, and film.</p>
<p>Regarding the film itself, various newspaper film columns have been criticizing it recently, and it is expected that an opinion representing the majority of Chinese audiences will be determined. However, it seems that Chaliapin himself is easily misunderstood, because I once saw a sentence in an article criticizing the film, saying that Chaliapin was once very famous in the Russian aristocratic theater before the revolution. This sentence easily implies to readers that Chaliapin was a singer who served the aristocracy, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>Chaliapin was born in 1873 in a poor people's house in Ometievo Village near Kazan, Russia. His father was a clerk in the village office. When he was studying in elementary school, he was expelled from the school twice, once for kissing a female student, and once for fighting with a classmate (who actually beat him). So his father thought he was incorrigible and sent him to work as an apprentice in a shoe store in Kazan at the age of eleven.</p>
<p>Next to the shoe store was a bakery. In this bakery, there was a young baker who earned the least but read the most, whose name at the time was Alexei Maximovich Peshkov, and is now called Maxim Gorky, the great writer of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If Gorky had not met Chaliapin, and if the hard life of wandering later had not damaged his voice, perhaps he would not be a literary giant of the Soviet Union now, but a singer ranked second. Because when he was a baker, Gorky was not only a scholar among his partners, but also an artist who could entertain them with the best singing every day. Conversely, if Chaliapin had not met Gorky at that time, he would not have found better companions in his wandering life, he would not have been easily influenced by noble literature and art, his singing would inevitably become vulgar and become a江湖派, and thus be unknown to the world. Therefore, their friendship was of great help to their careers.</p>
<p>Because they could not bear the hopeless hard labor, one escaped from the bakery and the other escaped from the shoe store. The two of them wandered together in various villages. Chaliapin sold songs along the way, but Gorky dared not sing, he told stories to people. This wandering life laid the foundation for their respective arts.</p>
<p>According to Chaliapin himself, in a recent article published in the British magazine (The Reader) called (The Life Behind Art), he narrated that he understood from this wandering life that if a singer wants to gain a large audience, he not only needs a skillful voice, but also must make his songs (active), must (immerse) himself in his music, and must make himself (become the role he is playing).</p>
<p>From joining an opera troupe at the age of nineteen, earning twenty rubles a month, until the eve of the Russian Revolution, Chaliapin returned from a tour of the United States and became the pillar of the Moscow Imperial Theatre. At that time, he was indeed an artistic supplier to the nobles, because the poor simply could not afford to listen to his plays, but this was not his fault. In his autobiography published in 1927, he recorded a story that is very sufficient for us to understand him. I will now excerpt it here:</p>
<p>(When the Bolsheviks occupied Kronstadt, a group of soldiers and sailors came to ask me to give them a concert. I immediately agreed, but some friends advised me to refuse them.</p>
<p>(This is dangerous,) they said, (maybe this is a trick, they will say you are a bourgeoisie and kill you).</p>
<p>(Why would they kill me?) I said, (I have not offended them. Perhaps my songs will help them calm their anger.)</p>
<p>So I performed in a large cavalry school. About fifteen thousand sailors, soldiers, engineers, stokers and women came to listen. There was an engineer, who seemed to have heard the concert before, and when each song was finished, he shouted the French word "Bis! Bis!" (that is, the Chinese (再來一個!)</p>
<p>But many people next to him did not understand the meaning of this word. They probably misunderstood it as the Little Russian word "Bis". Although the sound is similar, the meaning is very different. Its explanation is (devil). So a stoker with bulging veins immediately rolled up his sleeves and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>(What bastard dares to scold Chaliapin, if you open your mouth again, I will knock out your teeth!)</p>
<p>Saying that, he sent a rather large fist up.</p>
<p>Seeing that they were about to fight, someone explained the misunderstanding. So the stoker, who was righteous, scratched his head and said to the engineer:</p>
<p>(Sorry, friend, I didn't understand.)</p>
<p>When I left there, I was really moved by the congratulations of those waiting outside the door. An old woman in ragged clothes looked at me and said:</p>
<p>(Thank you, thank you! Dear Fyodor Ivanovich (Chaliapin's name), I finally listened to your play!)</p>
<p>In this way, in the entire seven years of the terrible revolution, the sound of music never stopped. This may be because Russians cannot live without music. So the art under the Tsar's rule is still art under the Soviet rule.) From this story, we can know that Chaliapin, the artist, is not only for the nobles, nor only for the common people, he should be said to be for humanity. At the same time, we can also appreciate that as long as it is pure art, whether under the Tsar or the Soviets, it is always the same.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (61)</h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>They shut their mouths. He thought she would be flustered, but he didn't expect her to be so calm. He had expected some flattering and lovely gestures, some rejections that indicated consent. He had expected to stage a witty comedy of love while catching shrimp in the rippling water! But now it's over. He felt that he had only said twenty words and they were already united, already married. Since they both agreed, then they had nothing more to say. Now they both felt a little embarrassed about everything that had happened so quickly, even a little ashamed. They dared not speak again, dared not catch shrimp again, and simply didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>Old Man Roland's voice saved them:</p>
<p>(Come here, come here, children! Come and see Bo Bao Ru. He has caught all the shrimp in the sea, this guy.)</p>
<p>Captain Bo Qi Ru's shrimp fishing results were really excellent. He soaked his waist in the water, from this mud to that mud, and recognized the best place at a glance. Then, with his shrimp net, he searched all the shrimp nests hidden under the seaweed with a calm and accurate movement.</p>
<p>And those beautiful, transparent, grayish-brown sea shrimp were jumping in his palm when he threw them into the back basket with a neat gesture.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lu Zui Mi was surprised and happy, and never left him again, trying her best to imitate him, almost forgetting what she had allowed and the Jean who was dreaming behind her. She was just wholeheartedly immersed in the childlike joy of scooping up sea shrimp from under the floating grass. Roland suddenly shouted:</p>
<p>(Look, Mrs. Roland has run to us.)</p>
<p>She and Bier originally stayed on the shipwreck alone, because neither of them had the desire to run to the reef or search in the pool. But they hesitated to stay together. She was afraid of him, and her son was also afraid of her and himself, afraid of his own uncontrollable cruelty.</p>
<p>Later, they finally sat very close to each other on the sandy beach.</p>
<p>The two of them, together in the summer heat that had been softened by the sea breeze, faced the vast and peaceful horizon of the blue sea water shimmering with silver light, and thought at the same time: (If it had been before, how comfortable the weather would have been in this place!) She dared not speak to Bier, she knew he would give her a cold answer. He also dared not talk to his mother, he knew that he would involuntarily say something fierce.</p>
<p>He trampled on the round pebbles with the tip of his stick. He turned them and struck them. She, with her eyes blurred, grabbed three or four stones in her hand, and passed them from this hand to that hand with a steady and slow mechanical gesture. Then, her erratic gaze, which was wandering forward, saw her son catching shrimp with Mrs. Lu in the seaweed. So she followed them with her eyes, peeking at their movements. With her mother's instinct, she vaguely understood that they had not exchanged a word as usual. When they were watching on the water, she saw them bending over side by side. When they probed their hearts, she saw them standing face to face. Then she saw them climb the reef and sit on it to make a marriage contract.</p>
<p>Their images were very clearly floating in the background between the water and the sky where it seemed that only the two of them were. Their images, in this vast expanse of sky, sea, and shore, showed a kind of great aura and seemed to symbolize something.</p>
<p>Bier also saw them, and a dry laugh suddenly came from his lips.</p>
<p>Roland's code: did not turn around, but she asked him:</p>
<p>(What's wrong with you?)</p>
<p>He always mocked and laughed:</p>
<p>(I'm learning. I now understand how people are preparing to become turtles.)</p>

<h3>The Biggest Feeling After Reading This Special Issue</h3>
<p>— Gongpu</p>
<p>After we decided to publish these three special issues on Esperanto, we divided the content of the special issues into three aspects, namely:</p>
<p>(1) A brief history and general overview of the Esperanto movement; (2) The status of Esperanto in today's international community; (3) The situation of the Esperanto movement in various parts of China. When the reporter was editing and reviewing this issue's manuscripts describing the situation of the Esperanto movement in various parts of China, we could clearly see that the level of the Esperanto movement in China, except for Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, etc., which were slightly energetic, most of the inland provinces were still in a rare situation. Of course, this is not enough to worry about the future of the Esperanto movement, because the seriousness of this phenomenon is a reflection of the general low level of Chinese culture. We see the general sluggishness of the publishing industry across the country, and know that most Chinese people are so indifferent to books and newspapers in their own language, and it is only natural that they have no time to pay attention to (Esperanto). However, culture is a representative of a nation. If culture is declining day by day, it means that the vitality of this nation must also be weakening day by day. Therefore, anyone engaged in the movement to revive the nation must first pay attention to the work of reviving culture. Only when culture is revived can the nation have vitality, and only a vital nation can have the spirit of revolution. We silently observe that most of the Chinese people today are still living in a situation of complacency under the multiple oppressions of natural disasters, man-made disasters, and the political and economic aggression of imperialism. We deeply feel that the success of the Chinese national revolution is still far away! Those engaged in the Esperanto movement will naturally encounter extraordinary difficulties in this environment, but the part of the responsibility they bear for reviving culture is therefore particularly increased. This is the biggest feeling that the reporter has after reading about the situation of the Esperanto movement in China. What do you think, scholars of Esperanto?</p>
<h3>The Esperanto Movement in China: The World Movement in Peiping</h3>
<p>— Zhong Tianqi</p>
<p>Around the early years of the Republic of China, an (Esperanto Training Institute) appeared near Shuncheng Root Yuane School in Beijing. The host was Jin Mengchang and the teacher was Wu Tianmin. Although the class only lasted for one month, there were seventy or eighty students. It is said that this was the first Esperanto movement in Peiping. Not long after, Cai Yuanpei became Minister of Education, and the Esperanto movement in Beijing, under the advocacy of the Ministry of Education, made great progress. Therefore, the (Esperanto Training Institute) of Yuane School developed from (privately run) to (officially run). The red seal (Esperanto Specialized School Affiliated to the Ministry of Education) is still in the library of Peking University.</p>
<p>At that time, the organization of the Esperanto Society of Peking University also became active. Peking University added Esperanto courses, and teachers Sun Mizhang and Russian blind poet Ero Shenke both lectured at Peking University. The current Peking University Press can still buy several Esperanto reading materials at that time.</p>
<p>In this initial movement, it is worth noting that a celebration meeting for Zamenhof's birthday was held in the auditorium of the Third Court of Peking University. More than 1,000 people attended this grand meeting. Important people who attended the meeting included Liu Chunlin, representative of the President, Shen Buzhou, Vice Minister of Education, and Gu Weijun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Sherishev, Sun Guozhang, and Ero Shenke gave speeches in Esperanto.</p>
<p>Hu Jingyi, the former commander of the Second National Army, was a person who was enthusiastic about Esperanto. The (Esperanto Specialized School) in Mengrui Hutong was opened in the eighth and ninth years of the Republic of China with the support of Hu. The teachers were Feng Shengsan, Sherishev, and Chen Shenshu. At that time, there were quite a few talents, and the teaching results were also good. Wang Xizhou, who is now in charge of the Esperanto movement in Suiyuan, graduated from this school. However, the school was closed due to political changes.</p>
<p>In the early days, the Esperanto movement in Peiping relied on the promotion of the Ministry of Education and other superiors on the one hand, and on the other hand, it was also due to the urgent demand for Esperanto from the society and the resonance with the ideals of human peace and equality. Otherwise, it would never have become a movement.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, with the rise of the anti-imperialist and anti-Japanese movement, the Esperanto movement in Peiping also flourished again. Peking University first established a training class, and other schools also established Esperanto societies.</p>
<p>In January 1932, the (Peiping Esperanto League) was established. In their declaration, they said: (In order to truly liberate ourselves from the oppressed position, we must obtain a link to communicate between nations and increase the weapons of mass culture.)</p>
<p>In addition, there is also the (Peiping Esperanto Society Federation), which is the guiding and unifying organization of the Esperanto societies of various schools, and sends lecturers to teach in various places. For example, Peking University, Normal University, China College, Chaoyang College, Peiping Normal University, Women's College, Women's No. 1 Middle School, Yijiao Girls' Middle School, Agricultural College, Engineering College, Tsinghua University, Anzhong, Salt Affairs, Police High School, Business College...etc., all schools have opened classes to teach. In particular, Peking University and Normal University have opened seven primary classes each, with an average of more than 30 students each time. Advanced classes have been opened once each.</p>
<p>Peiping from 1932 to 1933, like Shanghai, was one of the two major pillars of the Esperanto movement in China, full of lively and new atmosphere. This year, Peiping Esperanto speakers, in view of the fact that the (Society Federation) is only the general association of Esperanto groups of students from various schools, and social people cannot participate, in order to eliminate this shortcoming, they established the (Preparatory Committee of the Peiping Esperanto Association), and actively promoted the Esperanto movement in Peiping. A supplement (The Light of Esperanto) was published in the famous newspaper in North China, (The World Daily), which is published every Friday. Since the weekly was founded on June 23 this year, it has been published for more than 20 issues.</p>
<p>Obviously, Peiping is currently the center of the Esperanto movement in North China, and its future is full of hope. The general public in Peiping also has a good understanding of Esperanto. Many books and magazines have abandoned English and used Esperanto subtitles instead. (The World Daily)'s 1934 calendar also uses Esperanto to mark the months and weeks. The newspapers in Peiping are very welcome to publish articles related to Esperanto. And other places in North China, stimulated by the progress of the Esperanto movement in Peiping, are also beginning to become active. The recent establishment of the (Esperanto Society of Peiyang University) in Tianjin is one example. From these facts, we can know that the Esperanto movement in Peiping not only has a great future, but also has great significance for the entire Esperanto movement in China.</p>

<p>Special Discussion on Esperanto</p>
<h3>A Review and Prospect of the Esperanto Movement in China</h3>
<p>— Jing Zhaoxin</p>
<p>The Esperanto movement has a history of almost thirty years in China. These thirty years of history can be divided into three periods; from the beginning to 1914, it can be said to be a (utopian period). At that time, the predecessors who advocated Esperanto were mostly obsessed with the (internal ideal) of Zamenhof, the founder of Esperanto, and enthusiastically promoted the Esperanto movement as a religion. The spirit and perseverance of these pioneers are admirable, but they idealized Esperanto too much, thinking that they could obtain the shadows of peace and friendship from Esperanto itself, but separated the Esperanto movement from realistic problems. This is the shortcoming of the early Esperanto movement.</p>
<p>The World War broke out in 1914, and Chinese politics also entered a dark age. Idealism was shattered, and the Esperanto movement declined. It was not until after 1918 that the Esperanto movement in China, awakened by the May Fourth Movement, started again. At that time, the Esperanto movement focused on practical applications, the compilation and printing of Esperanto research books, the publication of magazines and publications, the establishment of tutoring classes and correspondence schools in various places, and the beginning of attention to Esperanto by the vocational circles (such as the postal and telecommunications circles), this period being the most prosperous. At the same time, debates on the structure and effectiveness of Esperanto writing and the relationship between Esperanto and the national language attracted the attention of the general public during this period. Therefore, this period can be called the (practical period) of the Esperanto movement.</p>
<p>The Great Revolution of 1926-7 came. The Esperanto movement was gradually ignored by people. However, after the political and social turmoil temporarily passed, the Esperanto movement made a comeback, but it changed its face and entered the (struggle period) from the (practical era). Originally, after 1926, China's national liberation movement had a close relationship with the international broad liberation movement. China was moving towards the road of struggle, and Esperanto, because it is a sharp tool to communicate the feelings of various nations, especially to promote the solidarity of the masses of various countries, can become a tool of struggle. Therefore, in this period, Esperanto is no longer just a pastime for the leisure class, and Esperantoism is no longer a paralyzing illusion of peace.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be seen that Esperanto and the Esperanto movement are not super-historical categories. On the contrary, they are constantly developing and growing with the changes of the times. In the early days of the Esperanto movement, China was in the enlightenment period of cultural innovation, and the utopian doctrine of peace and fraternity represented the ideological characteristics of the time, so the so-called (internal ideal) became the keynote of the Esperanto movement at that time. However, this era has disappeared, and the Esperanto ideal representing this era cannot but disappear. Even if you want to point out the old brand and be infatuated with the bones, what's the use? The Esperanto movement in the second period was relatively practical, but it rose with the rise of the Chinese petty bourgeoisie after the May Fourth Movement. This era is now collapsing, so the pragmatic view of Esperanto still cannot be built. We only have to see that the early advocates of Esperanto not only no longer talk about Esperanto and peace and fraternity, but also become obstacles to all cultural innovations, which shows that the first period of the Esperanto movement is dead. Looking again at Mr. Yiguxuantong, who advocated Esperanto most vigorously in the May Fourth era, did not study Esperanto himself, practical Esperanto, so what kind of achievements the pragmatic Esperanto movement has achieved can be imagined.</p>
<p>The era that has passed has passed, and the era that has died has died, but Esperanto and the Esperanto movement have not died, and have been reborn. If the veteran Esperanto speakers are tired of Esperanto and leave the Esperanto movement, young people and the working masses begin to pay attention to Esperanto and support the Esperanto movement. Naturally, young people and the masses need Esperanto, not to paralyze themselves, construct their own fantasies, let alone for personal use, but to use Esperanto for social use. Only by recognizing the social significance of the Esperanto movement can we not misuse Esperanto. Only from here can we find the broad future of the Esperanto movement.</p>
<p>China, like many Eastern countries, will leap from the backward state of economic and cultural to the forefront of the times. A great struggle is unfolding. Therefore, the Esperanto movement in China has a very important task. The development of the Esperanto movement in the East in recent years is faster than in the West. In particular, Esperanto speakers in Japan have made greater efforts than any other country. This is by no means accidental. Easterners who are catching up with the times need Esperanto as a tool more urgently than Westerners.</p>
<p>Therefore, the future of the Esperanto movement in China is unlimited. At present, there are many difficulties in front of us. The development of this new stage of the Esperanto movement is only a glimmer of dawn. Only young people can take responsibility, overcome all difficulties, and make Esperanto embark on a broad new path.</p>
<h3>Esperanto Movement in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Chu Deming</p>
<p>Shanghai is a so-called "cosmopolitan" international city and also the current cultural center of China. Therefore, the general public is more sensitive to international culture and international language issues than people in the hinterland. Furthermore, because the Esperanto movement has a longer history in Shanghai, the Esperanto movement in Shanghai is of great significance to the entire Chinese Esperanto movement.</p>
<p>It is said that in 1906, Mr. Liu Shipei established a training class in Shanghai, which may be the pioneer of the Esperanto movement in Shanghai. The following year, Mr. Lu Shikai also opened a class in Shanghai to teach. I don't know what happened to Mr. Liu now. The reporter has met Mr. Lu a few times, and it is said that he came into contact with Russians due to commercial relations. Mr. Lu learned Esperanto from a Russian. In 1909, the "Chinese Esperanto Association" was established in Shanghai, which was later reorganized into the "Republic of China Esperanto Association." It also opened correspondence courses, published magazines, and established branches in Changshu, Nanjing, and other places. This was more than twenty years ago, so the detailed situation is not very clear.</p>
<p>Around 1927, the Jiangwan Labor University included Esperanto in its curriculum. The professor was the Japanese Yamaga Taiji, who used the direct teaching method (i.e., without Chinese translation). Later, Yamaga left Shanghai and returned to Japan, and Mr. Zhu Zhenjiang, the school doctor, took over. The Esperanto movement in Shanghai was quite powerful for a time.</p>
<p>In schools, Fudan University and Lida Academy and other schools have successively organized Esperanto societies. However, during the "January 28th Incident," not only Jiangwan and Zhabei were baptized by the artillery fire of the "Imperial Army," but the Esperanto movement in Shanghai was also fatally hit. At that time, the "Shanghai Esperanto Society," located in Zhabei, suffered great losses, and its affairs came to a standstill. Although the movement was interrupted on the surface, some young Esperantists in Shanghai did not forget their mission under the threat of artillery fire! It is said that at that time, many comrades organized the "International Propaganda Committee" to expose the armed attacks of Japanese imperialism to the world in Esperanto, and won the sympathetic support of various countries.</p>
<p>Soon after the January 28th Incident, the "Chinese Esperanto Correspondence School" was also established. At that time, it was the only place in Shanghai that spread Esperanto. In December 1932, the "Chinese Esperanto Correspondence School" launched the Esperanto Exhibition, which was even more successful. In January 1933, the "Shanghai Esperantists Association" was established, and the Esperanto movement in Shanghai began to develop vigorously again.</p>
<p>Now let's describe the existing Esperanto organizations in Shanghai:</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Esperanto Association was established in the spring of this year. Its members include Chinese, Japanese, British, Austrian, and other nationalities, so it is named the "Shanghai International Esperanto Association." Because it was established not long ago, there are only dozens of members. A certain radio station in this city once broadcast Esperanto lessons by the association, and there were many learners for a while. The association had planned to open a training class, but it has not been realized due to various difficulties. The association welcomes people from all countries to join. The membership fee is five cents per month, and the mailing address is Shanghai P.O. Box 1871.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Esperanto Society is one of the most powerful Esperanto organizations in China and was established very early. In the past, it was in (students</p>
