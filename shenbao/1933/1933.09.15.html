<p>唐外次聲稱丨</p>
<p>均係拜會性質</p>
<p>（南京）　日本公使有吉偕參贊崛内有野及通譯橫川、十四晨到京、住日領館、有</p>
<p>吉此來、外間推測多認中日間題之重大轉捩、據外次唐有壬談、有吉公使之來、事前並無接洽、但旣到京、則汪兼部長當然予以接見、此爲拜訪性質、因汪兼部長就職後、各或代表均已見過、而日使則尙闕然也、（十四日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）　俄使鮑格莫洛夫今晨與有吉同車到京、據鮑氏云、仍爲各地分館事宜、别無其他任務、又有吉云、來京係因貴國行政院長汪兆銘、兼署外交部長後之例行拜會、尙無其他要務、（十四日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）　日前有傳汪將電羅文幹同任外長之說、某中委謂、羅係奉令赴新、甫抵省垣、所負使命正待開始、政府詎能驟然變更原議、可知電催回京之說、决無其事、外部發言人云、報載外次唐有壬與日領約定、本日下午六時、由汪院長接見日使有吉、懇切會談中日問題云云、據外交部發言人稱、此項消息、絕對不確、日使有吉此次來京、純係按照外交慣例、拜會新任兼署外交部長、别無任務、聞汪兼署部長、將於本日下午六時、在鐡道部官舍延見、同日並接見他國代表、均屬拜會性質、（十四日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）　日使有吉明十四晨抵京後、下午二時赴鷄鳴寺五洲公園游覽、四時返領館、六時偕崛内橫川等赴鐡部一號謁汪、由外次唐有壬代表汪氏迎於門首、旋導赴客廳、汪即出見、彼此談話多時、多係應酬語、對外交事未提及、七時汪設宴爲之洗塵、並請外次徐謨作陪、八時餘宴畢、有吉等即辭出、聞有吉在京、擬勾留一星期、日方宣稱、有吉此來於中日外交有所商談外、並擬向我國提出中日商約談判、因中日商約、自前年期满、已失效用、其附表之一部、亦於本年五月十六期满廢止、現僅存關稅恊定、不足爲商約之代用條文、中日商務關係、目下並無條約可資依據、故擬提出談判、如新約能即時成立、希望過渡期間、仍維持舊約有效、但我國政府對於舊約旣經期满廢止、當然不能認爲有效、至另訂過渡辦法之說、以中日間目下形勢上看來、一時尙談不到、（十四日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）　日使有吉來京拜會汪兼外長、外間頗多揣測、外次唐有壬十四日語記者、自汪兼外長、按之外交情例、各國公使例須來京拜會、故俄大使亦於今日會汪、並無特殊任務、我與日雖以兵戎相見、但未斷絕國交、日使來會、亦無拒見之理、某報謂有吉此來、係與汪兼外長會談中日問題、並謂係日外交官透出消息、此種記載、不啻爲日宣傳、其影響至爲惡劣、余曾電詢駐京日領、根究此事、彼亦絕對否認、足證此項記載無稽矣、唐又云、廣田旅歐多年、此次就任日外相、或將與歐美漸謀接近、但對華外交、不致有何變動、蔣作賓赴日期尙未定、日前在滬、曾向黃郛促駕北上、因灤東匪勢蔓延、警察力量不易鎭壓如派兵進剿、恐違恊定、故盼黃赴平主持、（十四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）　俄使鮑格莫洛夫十四日下午四時、特赴鐡部一號官邸拜會汪兼外長、五時半赴外部訪常次唐有壬、並亞洲司長沈覲鼎、有所晤談、旋即辭出、聞係拜訪性質、無特殊使命、（十四日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評日内田辭職　　實　　丨丨日本政局動搖東亞風雲緊急丨丨　　日本内田康哉就任外務大臣之際。本以强硬外交相號召。與軍閥預有切實諒解。甚至高唱不惜「化日本全國爲焦土」之口號。以博其歡心。一年餘以來。日本對外交不能謂爲不强硬。特未實踐其化全國爲焦土之言耳。然而仍不能軍閥之同情。且招日本人民之反感。遂致不能安於其位而辭職。爲齋藤内閣崩壞之先聲。廣田弘毅以「中國通」繼任外務大臣。以圖打開外交孤立之難關。在事實上是否能如其所預期而順利進行。非特廣田氏自已不敢預斷即自空一切日軍閥。恐亦不能遽作樂觀也。　　日本軍人之橫行。近兩年來特别顯著。在外旣未遭强有力之實力敎訓。在内亦未遇本國資產家之正面衝突。日本之憲政早已置諸刺刀上。而支配議會政治之財閥。已反退居於第二位矣。齋藤内閣承大養被刺之後。號稱舉國一致之强力内閣。鎔政友會民政黨於一爐。冶三井三菱兩大財閥爲一家。宜乎所謂强力政治。可以實現。國際孤立。可以打開矣。殊不知世界情勢。决不能盡如日軍閥之意我中國雖弱。而我民衆對日。迄未表示妥恊。歐美諸强國雖爲經濟力所限。不克立即作軍事之戰爭。而經濟戰爭則已開始。印度之增加關稅。南菲之制限輸入即其顯著之例證。美國雖捲入極大之金融恐慌狂潮中。而其近日亦盡力增建軍艦可知其匪特不忘情於遠東市塲。且將積極準備作戰。日本之所謂强力一致内閣。依然委靡不振。同時政友會與民政黨之暗爭。三井與三菱之對立。自政治以迄經濟利益。仍舊想持不下。所謂國難。並未稍减。政治上之罅隙愈多。經濟的破綻。亦愈暴露。日閥雖竭力彌縫於一時。而亦不可得。　　且觀英美兩國。大有聯合以制日本之情勢。倫敦條約三年後即失時效。日本旣在此時期。提高其海軍戰鬥力。英美亦早有準備於是乎一九三六年。眞將成爲一戰爭恐怖之關頭矣。此種情勢。反映於日本國内遂引起政治上社會上不安。蓋日本軍力雖强。對付我軍備不振之中國。固似有餘。但其國民經濟甚爲衰落。而欲以之應付世界戰爭。則其弱點甚多。矧近代戰爭。必須以整個國民經濟力爲主幹乎。　　　立體戰爭。尤須以航空隊及毒瓦斯爲前鋒。一旦戰事發端日本固不難運用其優勢海軍。襲取菲利濱及關島。然日本國内諸重要軍事工業中心地帶。與夫南满路沿線。皆將難免飛機轟炸之威脅。欲圖軍事上之安全保障。即日人亦自知其無此把握也。故齋藤内閣。俳佪於議會政治與軍事獨裁之間。不敢驟然斷定挑戰與緩和戰爭之孰爲有利。形成衰老無力之現象。於是遂引起荒木一派急進武人之不满。與夫受軍力麻醉之與論非難。高橋是淸雖號爲超然。其實不免受三井派之牽制。稍微顧及資本閥及一般人之利益。主張削减陸海軍預算。乃益激起軍部之極度反動。荒木公然出馬。提出所謂國策。致内田康哉不得不率先去職。其實彼所謂國策。僅集注其全副精神於擴張軍備。無所謂外交。至於敎育思想等問題。更不過一種陪襯而已。　　日本政局因内田去職廣田繼任。而顯示其動搖矣。設使齋藤内閣由此下台。繼之而起者。其政黨内閣乎聯合内閣乎。抑軍人獨裁内閣乎。在今日情勢之下。日本政黨。已完全失去運用政治之能力。又乏統制全國之信譽。惟軍人直接專政如德意形態。似尙過早。結果恐仍不免以舉國一致之名。而軍部爲背後之最高權力。操縱國政。使日本全國皆軍閥化。果如此則日本國内將愈見緊張。刺激其他國家亦愈甚。其勢足以促進太平洋或印度洋戰爭之急速爆發。固無疑也。陜甘災重無力修路　　（西安）　蔣委員長頃電邵力子楊虎城修築陜甘陜鄂陜豫各公路、並謂中央可酌予補助、當經省府會議通過、先交建廳測量西安至老河口及西安至甘東邊界兩路、擬具計劃、再行核奪、邵楊以本省災重財竭、十三日聯名電蔣、陳明情形、並請主持、（十三日中央社電）于右任滙欵賑陜災　　（西安）三原災重、于右任曾匯欵一萬零五百元賑濟、現賑會已將災區調查完竣、計淹地共三萬四千餘畝、死亡人數一百五十四名、賑僵即將分等散放賑欵、（十三日中央社電）交部令修包寜電綫　　（南京）　交部以包頭寗夏電綫被水冲斷、電令蘭州張垣兩管理局、趕速修復、未恢復前、來往電報、由中間各局、儘量收轉、（十四日中央社電）蔣嚴令查禁種烟　　（漢口）　蔣委員長十四日分電蘇顧·浙魯·皖劉·鄂張·湘何·豫劉·贛態·閩蔣·陜邵·甘朱·各主席、漢何·汴劉·陜楊·各綏靖主任、以查禁種烟辦法、已呈奉國府核准、電令遵行、現烟苗下種之期將屆、恐各縣仍有偷種、希先期嚴切查禁、以絕毒氛、（十四日中央社電）何健派張其雄赴粵　　（長沙）　何健派張其雄赴粵、恊商剿匪、（十四日專電）湘省初試國考選手　　（長沙）　何健十四日初試二屆國考選手、取劉連生等四十三名訓練二十天後、遴三十名送京、（十四日專電）</p>

<p>L&gt;自由談希望與信仰  林微音　　要是你覺得做人没有什麽意味，有時甚至有生不如死之感、那是因爲你没有希望，有了希望，你就會覺得前途無限了。　　只是你要希望，第一你先得要有信仰。最好的信仰就是相信上帝，因爲你相信了上帝，非特你不必再有别的希望就可怡悅地過你的一生，而且在死後，你還可進天堂。即使你是一個在生前也想享受一些的人，你相信了上帝也是可以有一個希望的。那希望是，你的惡劣的環境也許是上帝過意爲你設置的，他要磨難你，他要試探你，看你的信心堅固不堅固；在那樣磨難着，那樣試探着，你還是半句怨言都没有的時候，他會出你不意地使你有一筆錢財，要是你希望的是錢財的話；要是你希望的是女人，他會給你一個天仙。　　其次是對於什麽政治有信仰。你知道你的不如意是由於政治組織的欠完善。你便相信總有一天會出一個眞命天子，到那時自會風調雨順，天下太平，你也可不會再有衣食不足的憂慮了。那樣，雖然現實是苦楚的，你旣有了那樣的一個希望，你也可有所期地安然向前走去了。　　可是要是你以爲什麽都是空的，你只想要有錢，有了錢你就可隨意擺佈一切，那末，你可去買航空獎劵。買航空獎劵是個最靠得住的藉此發財的方法，這一次落空了，還有下一次，遲早總有一個頭獎是你的，你可這樣相信。於是你有了一個希望；就只爲使你有一個希望起見，也値得去買航空獎劵。　　旣没有希望，又没有信仰的人，從表面看來似乎是大澈大悟的，其實也許只是一個傻瓜。勵友人書  老舍XX仁兄：　　在咱們的社會裏没有『大』事體。東北四省丢去誰曾落一個淚來？赤俄的五年計劃還不是說說而已？你可能告訴我一件『大』事？高明而憧憬的你！不能：本來没大事，從那裏說起來呢？自然，包了一把三翻是天大的事，可是和旁家打起來而終于没包，那麽、說牠作甚？昨天咱的肚子疼了一陣，恐怕是要生小孩；怎奈咱不是女性。是故天下原無大事，爲人何不馬馬虎虎？天地者萬物之逆旅：欠下旅館費，雖秦二爺亦捨不得賣黃驃馬也。大事化小，小事化無，是爲上策。夫中華亦大國呀，失了四省，則較小矣，是謂大事化小，省去許多麻煩。全國亡了，不過小事化無而已，何足慮哉。生今之世，最宜不要臉：臉之全部有多大面積，就說和東三省比比吧？騎着脖子大便，任憑於他，到底是他的糞落在咱哥兒們的脖子上啊，大小總是個便宜。哀莫大於心死丨胡說！心怎會死、設若身上各部活活潑潑？你若不抓弄倆錢，因而没有飯吃，没有女性一同就寢，身上怎能活活潑潑，眉眼怎能亂動？手足眉眼僵硬不動，心會活着？連這個都不懂，白活！狗本食肉之獸，不得已乃改而吃糞，意識不能决定生活狀態，而生活狀態實决定意識的形式；雖馬克司復生，不易吾言喲！我們的字典上没有『恥』字。恥是抽象的，麫包與女子是具體的。不信，你要爲國難發愁而七日不食，恥則恥矣，可是你那個『象』即被閻王抽去，這是玩的嗎？反之，你舒舒服服吃點喝點戀點，身胖因而心廣，人說你是亡國奴，你正自肥頭大耳朶，哪個更近于生命的眞實？在生命上，小事是一切：大事根本没有一件。記住了這個，高明的你。以臉說吧，牠是爲有人說你的大衫不漂亮而紅的：難道日本人打了南京幾砲也値得紅臉？南京又不是你的私產！自然你若在好兒有處小房便另一個說法了。就是别着急，瞎混着比什麽也强。今天就和你談到這兒吧。祝吉！　　　舍九月二日愛書狂者之話  阿英　　三　　錢牧齋不僅買書也曾賣過書。在宋牧仲的「筠廊偶筆」裏我曾經看到一則關於他賣書的事。說王弇州先生有一部宋版「漢書，」得之吳中陸太宰家，紙爲羅紋紙，字類歐陽率更，是趙文敏的故物，卷首有文敏自作的小像。弇州也把自已的像印在後面。他死之後，錢牧齋用千金買得，後再賣給四明謝象三。牧齋賣書後曾說：　　此書去我之日，殊難爲懷。李後主去國，聽敎坊雜出曲，揮淚對宮娥一段，溱凉景色，約略相似。　　古人作文，有得句如得官的感相與快樂，由牧齋的故事看去，失書是和失江山一樣的嚴重了。牧仲又說，「順治間此書歸新鄉某公，近已携往塞外。」京口有個李維柱，聴到有這麽一部書，當說，假使能夠得到此書，當每日焚香禮拜，死即殉葬。古人愛書的狂熱，於此可以想見了。　　四、　　吳興陳鍚路玉田，著有「黃嬭餘話」八卷。第四卷有一則題做「針史」的說：　　荆州街子葛淸，自項以下，遍體剌　　白居易詩，凡二十多處，人呼爲「　　白舍人行詩圖，」此事大奇。王阮　　亭「香祖筆記」云爾。按葛淸事，見「酉陽雜俎。」「雜俎」所載剳靑一類甚多，統謂之鯨。又「淸異錄」云，自唐末無賴男子，以剳刺相高，或舖「鋼川圖」一本，或砌白樂天羅隠二人詩百首，至有以平生所歷郡縣飲酒蒱博之事，所交婦人姓名年齒行第坊巷形貌之詳，「一一標表者，時人號爲「針史。」然則如街子所爲，亦殊不足齒數，阮亭獨爲之詫歎何耶？　　陳玉田的籠統的結論，我是不敢同意的。我覺得刻詩刻書，是和記婦人姓名等等一樣，是表示被刺字畫者對某一事件，或某幾個事件狂愛的。這樣的愛書狂者，他們的熱情是更可感佩。再論「令眼出水」之基本英語  進之　　我覺得討論基本项語時，得把它與標準英語的界限分淸楚。所以錢先生　Wａｔｅｒ”（見九月十一日自由談）一字爲例，算不得基本英語能通行的好證明，因爲這字原是很好的標準英語。基本英語的特點是呌「鴿子」（Ｐｇｅｏｎ）爲「諾亞放出去看可有陸地的那種鳥「（Ｂｉｒｄ　ｔｈａｔｎｏａｈ　ｓｅｎｔ　ｏｕｔ　ｓｅｅ　ｉｆ　ｔｈｅｒｅ　ｗａｓ　ｌｓｎｄ），說「豪俠」（ｈｉｖａｌｒｕｓ）爲「像奧塞王和他隨從們」的行爲」（ｄｏｉｍｇｓ　Ｌｉｋｅ　ｏｔ　Ｋｉｎｇ　ａｒｔｈｕｒ　ａｎｄ　ｈｉｓ　ｍｅｎ）。這種用典故的話，不用說，不是不熟悉西洋傳說與精通英國史的人所能懂的。　所以事實上基本英語是一定和標準英語分不開的。一個賢明的學生，當他發覺他所學了的　話要轉灣捧角的基本英語也行不通時，卽使看着Ｃｉｔｒｌ　ａｎｄ　Ａｎｏａ那樣的書，也要絞盡腦汁去猜時、（請參明九月十日自由談林語堂先生「拿去我臉上的毛」一文），他一定棄基本英語而就標準英語。而那時他又得費一番心思去忘記以前學的許多表現法，忘記‘Ｌｎｋｅ　ｌｉｐｓ這表現法而說‘Ｋｉｓ”因此基本英語，正是其自身是呌人說話兜圈子一樣，是一條兜圈子的英語捷徑。因爲「環境不許我們全然抛棄英語」而呌人學一點英語，原是愛護靑年之意。然勸人學英語而定要使學者「城頒上出棺材，遠兜遠轉」，豈不使愛護變成捉弄　　這一回錢先生又說基本英語可作國際語了。這使我們有機會來談談這一點。照言語學告訴我們：言語是由方言而發展爲國語，再由國語而國際語，而其内容之豐富也是隨着它的發展階段而增加的。所以一種國際語當比任何國語豐富。而今基本英語怎樣？基本英語的裏面只有四種水果，九種禽獸，三種昆虫，一種鳥，没有魚，花，樹木（見國際每日文選四十號「英國人的基本英語批判」）。倘你要越出這範圍以外，你得費盡腦汁，用很多的形容調，把你要說的槪念描繪出來。而你要表現某種動作時，一定得請出十八個動詞中的一個來。這樣貧乏單調的言語而可作國際語，則以前那些畢生致力于國際語方案的製造者們，我們直可譏爲白痴了。關於基本英語的爭論  林翼之　　對於基本英語，擁護的雖然僅僅是基本英語書的編輯先生，而反對的却是權威的英語學者林語堂先生和世界語者。但我想勝利一定是歸於前者的。　　本來太陽光照到的地方都有英皇的旗幟，大砲，軍艦，浩蕩的皇軍，都在全世界上傳播英語，在領土内有所謂「大」英地界」的中國，不懂洋涇浜就連拉黃包車的資格也没有；一隻手麵包，一隻物寳劍，還有什麽事情做不到？於是我們那些「專顧環境」的學者（？），就不能不擁英語做國際語，而且要把它簡易化，使無學的奴隸們人人背脊上和「肚子上的重物不去」以便永遠替洋大人當苦力，有什麽法子呢？這是「環境」！環境如此，我們就樂得來擁護它，也不管「臉上的毛」拿去不拿去了。　　至於世界語者，這些毛小子算得什麽東西呢？國與國正在準備厮殺，他們却要什麽「世界主義」：全世界已經有五萬萬人講英國話，他們還高唱「愛斯不難讀」，顯得是不識時務，不顧環境；猶如在「满洲國」的敎育會議上，反對拿日本語作小學必修科，這還不是有「某種嫌疑」麽？基本英語的擁擭者懂得阿Q的精神勝利法：「無論環境如何要人臣服，在心而不在言語」，所以他們「身體的重被拉下」，而「頭上來，淸楚而自由」。　　所以我說，基本英語的擁擭者，一定會得到勝利，他們昻然的跑進理髮店裏，呌聲「拿去我臉上的毛」，便有人剃去他的鬍子，而「愉悅在他眼中。」世界語者呢，却躺在醫院床上呌「AKVO」，只惱得「看護不耐煩走來干涉」，結果便「令眼出水」！淺湖（五）  英國約瑟康拉德作侍桁譯　　「所以我要同你談說愛情的事。在這暗夜裏我談着。當暗夜和愛人還没有去了之前我談着」，於是那白日的眼將看着我的哀愁和我的羞恥；看着我的黑越越的面孔，我的燒焦了的心。」　　短而微弱的嘆息，形成一次幾乎看不出來的停止，於是他的話語流下去，他動也不動，也不露出什麽姿勢。　　「在戰爭和叛亂的時代過去之後，你離開了我們的土地，追求你的慾望去了，丨你那種慾」望，我們島國的人是不能理解的，於是我和我的哥哥像從前一樣地，又變成酋長的持刀的人。你曉得我們是名門之家，是支配者的族人，是比任何人都更適當在我們右肩上戴著權力的徽章。在平和的年間，希·典得靈給我們以寵愛，而反之，在叛亂的年間，我們給他以勇敢的忠誠。正好那是和平的時代；人們獵鹿，鬥鷄，人們吃飽了飯，武器都上了銹，而只是閑談的瞎購。所以那些種田的人，毫無憂慮地，望着稻芽的生長；買賣人們來來去去，臨行的時候，貧窮得可憐，可是再回到這平靜的河流來的時候，就非常地飽满了。同時他們也帶來許多消息。把謊語或眞事混合在一起，因此没有人曉得什麽時候應當歡喜，什麽時候應當哀愁。從他們口裏，我們也聽到你的消息。我是很喜歡聽的，因爲我記憶着那動亂的年代，所以我總記憶着你，屠安，直到我的眼再不能看見過往的事情的時候，因爲它們現在只是釘在那將死的人身上了丨在那房裏。」　　他折斷話語小聲而强烈呌着，「啊，災難哪·啊，災難哪！」於是更提高了聲音繼續着說：　　「屠安：作爲敵人，没有人是比弟兄更可怕的，可是作爲友人，没有人是比弟兄更可信」賴的了，因爲兄弟是彼此知道心的，而且在充分的理解中，無論善也吧，惡也吧，都能給你以極大的𦔳力。我愛我的哥哥，我去到他那里告訴他說，我現在只能看見一個人的面孔，只�能聽到一個人的聲音。他對我講：「打開你的心，使她可以看見你的肺腑丨丨於是等候着吧」。忍耐便是知慧。印枝·米妲也許會死掉，也許我們的酋長因爲厭煩而抛掉她！」···於是我就等候着！····屠安，你記得那個蒙面的女人以及我們的酋長對於她的小心的吧。她有無數侍女，我能有什麽辦法呢？可是我偶然地看她幾眼或是偷偷地說幾句話，以塡充我的内心的飢餓。白天我徘徊在到浴塲去的路上，等到太陽一落到森林的背後，我便沿着茉莉花垣爬到婦人的庭院去。不使人看見，在花香間，在葉叢中，在那聽止在我們的唇邊的長葦間，我們談着話；我們是那麽地小心，那麽小聲傾吐情愛。</p>

<h3>局部的裸</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>中國，畢竟是個中國；比上不足，比下有餘，此之謂中國。無論科學上，政治上，武備上，雖然很努力的追隨着世界諸先進國；但是、要下一個切當的評語、好雖不算好，壞也不大壞，酌乎其中；此之謂中國。</p>
<p>單就摩登女子的裸化程度而言，始而裸臂，繼而裸腿，衣袖和褲管的陣線雖然縮短，但是，退到最緊要的所在，也只有拚命守住，並非衣褲完全總退郤。似這般不澈底的裸體運動，比着德意志則不足，比看摩洛哥則有餘，裸的程度也是酌乎其中，此之謂中國女子的裸化程度。</p>
<p>同是二十世紀的婦女，做了摩洛哥婦女，何等束縛。做了德意志婦女，何等解放。</p>
<p>摩洛哥的婦女，個個和我國閨門女訓上所說的閨女一般。少女們一槪禁止和異性者會面；「抛頭露面」四個字，他們引爲大戒，有時，女性不得已出門，都要障着一個面幕，不使人家窺見粉靨。面都不能露，再休談裸臂裸腿了、所以，做了摩洛哥婦女，任何部分都不許裸。　　德意志婦女，對於裸運是很熱心的；當時，社會上也有一部分反對的人，以爲，全裸運動，未免有些駭人聽聞。於是，提出一種折衷辦法，下部設法掩蔽，女性還得兼蔽着乳；但是，經着許多衛生家的試騐，都說局部解放，而不全體解放，對於日光浴不免减少效力。雖這分上，折衷辦法遂被否决了，而實行其「一絲不掛」的日光浴，於是，德意志婦女，任何部分都不妨裸。</p>
<p>中國婦女的裸化，旣不是任何部份都裸，也是任何部份都不裸，只是一個酌中的局部的裸。</p>
<h3>穿梭式的回家</h3>
<p>— 碧波</p>
<p>治老式文藝的，根據最近某雜志登的廣告，「是薈集新舊兩派作家」的詞句，而產生上列的名辭」。外鄉旅滬人們裏，往常要算沈禹鐘是火車上的老客人，現在沈君早已擲筆抛硯，不再掉文，並且連到踨踪杳然，有許多朋友記念着他，可是都探聽不到他的下落，沈君可是眞的遯世了嗎？</p>
<p>凡是在蘇滬間常來常往的人，對於車　中和吳門的一切景物，都是司空見慣，記不勝記，亦記無可記，不過在下却須要兩三個月回去一次，在這長距離的日期裏，多少終有些變遷，回家那天，恰巧是北新屋行揭幕禮，午正到站，各處正在忙着拍照，從前的敞廳，依舊壯嚴地恢復了舊觀，可是兩邊的鐡栅鎖着，却還不能供給大衆作休憇之地，或者装飾部份，還没有竣工。　　那一次是滬鎭區間車，乘客不很擁擠，邂逅吳麟趾君，比座鬯談，倒也解去旅途的不少寂寞。斜對面一位西装客，偕同一個婦女，伊的面龐，十分和電影演員范雪朋女士相像，不過稍微瘦一些兒，而尤其酷肖的，是一雙向上瞧的眸子，他倆在崑山站下車。</p>
<p>三點鐘到蘇，坐着車兒向閶門走，馬路上大約因爲要行蘇嘉公路的汽車，所以新近似乎修理得比以前平坦了許多。但是上面却满舖了黃沙，馬車超過我的車子時，前面一陣陣的塵灰撲上來，好像到了北方。走過阿黛橋時，覺得幾年前熱閙的影子，和今日所瞧見的丨衰落丨凋疲丨景象比較，简直有不勝滄桑之感，再這們幾年，也許要變成今日的靑陽地咧。</p>
<p>回家省了親，講不到百十句話，便又怱怱的離家，在晚色迷濛裏，經過北寺塔出平門，到車站，這一條路上，街燈慘淡，加着墨雲一片，對面竟瞧不見來人，人力車若然不點那盞桐油燈時，管敎車輛會發生莽撞的戀愛，大家行個接吻禮。</p>
<p>東下車已經停靠在站上了，忙奔了上去，却四處找不到一個坐位，後來運我慧眼，果然在中間，發見了三缺一的座兒，情商了一位寗波先生的脚，請他喬遷在座下。後來曉得這位先生姓唐，是做藥房生意的，還有一位，一個是飽經閱經的地產商，一個是年少英俊的銀行家，他們謔浪笑傲，十分狎暱，忽然談到回力球的興趣，約定到了車站，忙雇車直趨球塲，要參與最後幾次的比賽，承他們很瞧得起我。將瓜子食物給我吃，我倒難爲情了。後來和他們敷衍的結果，所以明瞭了他們三位的職業，並且知道他們從當天一早到無鍚去逛，連夜趕回上海的，那些梁溪土產丨泥佛丨丨</p>
<p>麵筋丨却帶了兩大提。</p>
<p>崑山來了四個西人，三男一女，除了女子，他們都是紅着臉，在車廂裏奔來奔去，尋坐位。結果旁邊有一個很和敦睦邦交的人，連忙抱過一個小孩子，讓女人坐了。于是這三個男子，也停留在旁邊，拿出啤酒瓶，還是骨朶骨朶的，輪流喝着，將到上海時，他們的面部，却成了紫棠色咧。　　下車時，忽細雨溟蒙，站上已經装置好的年紅燈，還没通電流，其餘的一切，因爲我正在可惜化了幾塊錢，在家鄉只有三小時的勾當，所以也迷迷糊糊地不去細細打量，跳上了人力車，呌他一　，　西到家裏。（其實只能稱滬寓）</p>
<h3>聞高君友唐擬辭監委賦此留之</h3>
<p>— 崔麟臺</p>
<p>佇盼斯民解倒懸。彈冠詎爲作寒蟬。靑騘白兎皆强項。南鷂北鷹可並肩。欲使樞中無弊政。莫敎林下有遺賢。四知何必誇揚震。此老生平不愛錢。</p>
<p>世事千鈞一髮懸。獨標諜腀等孤蟬。時當患難應嘗膽。政不澄淸莫息肩。有此風稜震臺阁。從今月旦識姦賢。曲高何怪知音少。廉吏眞同萬選錢。</p>
<h3>蘇州頭和杭州脚</h3>
<p>— 李鵬翔</p>
<p>「蘇州頭，杭州脚，」這是江浙民間相傳的一句俗話。意思是說：蘇州的頭和杭州的脚都是這二地的特長。當然，這裏所說的頭和脚都是屬於女人的。但是我想，這句話大槪是跟了「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」而來的，未必蘇州女人的臉一定特别考究，而杭州女子的治脚的方法特别擅長。以前的讀書才子，看見這二地的風景著名天下，人傑地靈，於是便想到了蘇杭女人的身上，而勉强揑造出這種頭脚和品評來，恐怕也是說不定的。</p>
<p>但這些都可以不管，現在上海的頭和上海的脚郤蓋罩了蘇州的油頭粉臉，和杭州的三寸金蓮，這怕誰都不能否認的</p>
<p>了。假使那二地的「女性品評家」不肯承認的話，那末可以請他們到上海來，看一看這裏「又黑又亮的頭髮，」「又細又長的眉毛，」和襪子也不穿，脫得精光的天足；我想：他們一定會「心悅誠服」，嘆一聲，「已非昔比，風水轉變」吧。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十五回　　客去含羞柔情蕩微笑</p>
<p>人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>趙自强說了一大串子他，不知内容的，倒眞會有些莫明其妙。不過趙翁認定了兒子有一個他是指着桂枝說的，所以仔細一想，也就明白了。因道：旣然如此，這事情的確是好辦了。好在我上了幾歲年紀，一摸臉子，什麽也說得出來。現在你只管放心去辦你的公事，這一頭親事讓我來跟你辦好也就是了。趙自强笑道：我也没有什麽不放心。趙翁吸着烟，只管微笑着。好像對兒子這話，却不能加以認可。趙自强見父親都樂着有些開玩笑的意味，自已這就更樂了，便道；將來我要買點東西回來，用不着您去告訴小林做，而且做出來的口味，也許更好吃呢。他的菜，一定做得不錯。趙翁道：你吃過他做的菜嗎？趙自强笑道：這倒是没有吃過。照說，趟翁必定是要在下面問上一句，旣没有吃過，怎麽會知道好吃呢？可是趙翁把這句話留在肚子裏了，他只笑了一笑，並没有向下再說下文。趙自强和父親坐談了一會，没有其他的話可說了。因道：爸爸我先回營去了，我明天回來。趟翁道：這裏的事，我自然會跟你見機行事。你若抽不開身也就不必來。趙自强答應着是，就走出來了。他由前面院子裏經過的時候，依然將皮鞋後跟，走得磚石上得得作響。而且走的時候，還微微的咳嗽了幾聲。這種動作，雖不見怎樣的特别，然而在他看來，却是很有意味的，以爲桂枝在屋子裏聽到就知道是本人走了，或者出來看上一眼，也未可知。可是他揣想的却是不對，桂枝根本不曾走了出來。（一八七）</p>
<p>㳺於藝</p>
<h3>满江紅之三絕</h3>
<p>— 丈亮</p>
<p>名小說家張恨水之「满江紅」長篇說部，自經明星公司採用後，卽以極壓縮之方式改編爲電影脚本，歸導演「狂流」成功之程步高君導演，現已在新光大戲院公映矣。</p>
<p>此中，張君着力於各個人物之個性生活環境之描寫，對小資產階級藝術家們之苦悶與疲弱，在純客觀之立塲上用筆，以示其差誤，更爲確當，其成功遠過「啼笑因緣」。蓋一啼笑因緣」中傳奇的與英雄的色彩非常濃厚，讀者雖一度爲書中之主人公所沈醉，終不免對此種人</p>
<p>物的是否現實懷疑也。而在「满江紅」中，則適一反此弊，而每個角色均有現實可能，感人之程度乃愈深。藝之最高條件爲眞，因此，「满江紅」乃可謂爲藝術作品。</p>
<p>程步高導演自「狂流」博得美譽後，更增其前進的勇氣。本片中之技巧之圓熱，佈景之精細，剪接之巧妙，配音之吻合劇情等，均止於至善。藝術之第二條件爲「善」，因此，「满江紅」之成爲藝術作品，乃又多一保證。</p>
<p>已有眞實良好脚本，已有至善之導演，此影片卽可成爲一藝術片乎？曰，若無「美」的演出，此片終不免將受制命的打擊而流產。此片由影后胡蝶主演，龔稼農嚴月閒高倩蘋等合演，乃合脚本導演而成三絕。藝術之最終目的在「美」，「满江紅」之成爲一張藝術作品乃無疑。</p>
<h3>婦女解放的先决問題</h3>
<p>— 堅辛</p>
<p>「遂使天下父母心，不重生男重生女」。這不過是長恨歌中形容楊太眞邀朝皇的寵愛。其實中國數千年來的「父母心」，是「不重生女重生男」的，卽使賢達之士，也不能例外。</p>
<p>女子本來比男子荏弱，在一向以男子爲中心的中國社會裏，隨處都會受人欺侮玩弄，「婦女解放」的呼聲，雖然不絕如縷地有人在喊着，但是「妾」「婢」「養媳」「娼妓」等，社會上依然存在。而且事實告訴我們，「妾」和「娼妓」，比較從前增無减，這種現象，實在是整個的社會問題，决不是局部的問題。所以「婦女解放」運動的先决問題，要從剷除社會封建勢力入手。</p>
<p>天一公司新出品默片「飛絮」，劇中描寫一個不幸女子的遭遇，伊自幼便因父親不愛伊，遭父親的白眼，伊父親不愛伊的原因，便是爲了抱着「重男輕女」的傳統思想。伊有一個天眞爛漫的愛侶，已經有人替伊說親，可是爲了算命先生的幾句瞎話，把大好姻緣拆散，伊於是去做富家的婢女，那主人當然存着婢女是下賤的心理，虐待好像是應該的。伊從婢女生活又轉到養媳生活，在名義上，養媳似乎比婢女高出一籌，可是實際上伊養媳的生活，比婢女更加痛苦了。</p>
<p>「飛絮」的劇旨，是在抨擊重男經女的傳統思想，五行八字的逑信觀念，和婢女養媳制度的不應存在。所以「飛絮」在表面上看，似乎在叙述一個不幸的女子，骨子裏却在暴露封建社會的惡勢力。我們如果同情於像「飛絮」中的那種不幸女子，想設法去解放伊，援助伊，治本的辦法，應該先謀怎樣去剷除社會的封建勢力。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>九年，一瞬眼過去了！　　人</h3>
<p>今天的早晨，大約在七點半的時候，我從家裏出去，經過了東有恒路轉灣一直到兆豐路Ｍ校去學鋼琴。這條路是我前五年到前九年之間，每日必過的途徑，可是最近五年來，是很少有機會去走了。今天，是五年來第一次重走上這條路，因此不禁觸起了我茫茫然的感嘆！</p>
<p>Ｍ校裏仍舊是這樣莊嚴雄偉地建立着，除了添了一所新校舍外，一切都是在蒸蒸地上進着，眞像我們在離校時所唱的畢業歌一般：「望母校日進千里」！可是想到自已，是人類中的落伍的呢？是精進的呢？自已的熱望實現了多少？自已的豪志達到了幾何？這眞是一個絕大的疑問，連自已也回答不來。　　九年前我初進Ｍ校時，我還梳着二只小小的辮子，拿着一只手提箱上學去，簡單而小小的腦袋裏藴藏着些純潔的幼稚的玄想，我一些没有悲哀，没有愁苦，所感覺到的祗有愉快，祗有熱烈。在我纎弱的心弦上也曾經這樣的彈過「我要去服務社會，爲人羣造幸福。」雖然那時候婦女職業還在萌芽的時期。我的有服務社會的思想，也不知是受了什麽的影響和感化，連自已也不曉得。我祗是满腔熱情地這樣想想『現在努力用功讀書，將來終有達到目的的一日。「有志者，事竟成」就是這個意思呀！』</p>
<p>九年，一瞬眼過去了。眞的，在這短促其實是漫長的九年中，婦女界裏起了無數細小的或是重大的波浪！最顯明的是婦女頭上有悠久歷史的長髮，也因時代的轉變，而剪去了，現在的婦女，每個人都是篷鬆波浪般的長約齊領的短髮之緊束慣的胸部，也因潮流的驅使而解放了；最近女子赤脚露腿在街跑算是頂時髦了，這眞是九年前做夢想不到的事！此外，職業方面，女子也得到了些平等和地位，可是不幸之極，「花瓶」的雅號，亦竟因此成了女子的一個特殊的銜頭！這，這些現象是女子眞實的獲得解放嗎？澈底的得到平等了嗎？眞正的走上了社會的征途了嗎？許多人主張現在還需要再一次的婦女運動，我是極表同情的，自已不願領受「花瓶」的雅號，雖說仍然縮在一般人所說的慢性症的敎育界的一角，可是，童年的「服務社會，造福羣衆的幻想，以及近年來客觀的」</p>
<p>環境的影響，都加强我要創造現在，把握現實的信心！因爲「現在」是最可靠的呀！</p>
<p>今天又回到了母校裏，可是九年已經過去了，在這短促其實是漫長的九年裏我認識了社會上「婦女」的眞面目。我覺得現在我們婦女們是需要自已來作一次廣大的有效的婦女運動！</p>
<h3>女兒　敬嘉</h3>
<p>王太太和許太太是一對很親密的朋友，住在同一里中，不過只隔着五六家罷了！王太太有一個在初中裏念書的十五歲的女兒，生得很秀美很活潑，許太太　　　着，羡慕王太太的福氣好。</p>
<p>因爲她一個兒女都没有。</p>
<p>住在許太太家二樓亭子間中的人搬出去了，凑巧王太太家的三樓亭子間也空着，於是她們同時把召租條子貼出門外。</p>
<p>不久，就有二個學生到許太太家來說要租房子，許太太帶了笑臉引了他們看房子。</p>
<p>『十五塊錢一個月。』許太太說：『便宜的，要這種價錢找這樣的房子是没有的了。』</p>
<p>學生似乎很满意地點點頭。他們說：『晚上來給回信罷！』没付定洋就走了　。</p>
<p>學生去了之後就没有來過。許太太的房子仍舊空着。</p>
<p>有一天，王太太請許太太到她家裏打牌。許太太夫一進門就瞧見一個學生的影子一晃。</p>
<p>王太太告訴她房子已經租出去了，十八塊錢一月，是兩個ＸＸ大學生。</p>
<p>許太太紅了紅眼睛，嘆了口氣，輕輕地。</p>
<p>打完牌，在樓梯上碰到了剛回來的一個學生，那就是曾經來租過房子的那學生。</p>
<p>許太太回到家中，懷疑得很，她很奇怪那兩個學生爲什麽化十八塊錢去租王太太的房子，倒不願租十五塊錢的我的房子！房子不是一樣的嗎？</p>
<p>晚上，許太太和她底丈夫談起這件事。許先生笑了一笑說：『學生會有什麽好事！那裏有女人就住那裏！王太太不是有個女兒嗎？』</p>
<p>許太太更傷心了！她埋怨她自已爲什麽不生個女兒。</p>
<p>兩個月過去了！王太太突然一團怒氣的跑到許太太的家裏；王太太用很羞澀的聲調告訴許太太說她底女兒被那兩個學生引誘在旅館中住了四天。她說：『我一定不肯罷休！這是什麽話！我的女兒被帶壞了！她還能做人嗎？一定，我不能饒了他們！我一定要起訴，起訴！』　　王太太哭了！　　許太太呆半天。一句話也說不出來。　　許太太看了一看她那空着的亭子間，自言自語地說：『如其這樣，我寗可没有女兒把房子空着了！』</p>

<p>小孩子生了兩三個月，父母因爲呌呼便利起見，就替他取一個乳名，如：阿大，阿毛，阿囝，三倌，老四，小弟弟，小妹妹，小狗子，小三子···但是這些祗是一種呼號，因爲這種呼號不能載於經傳的緣故，所以當上學的時候，便要請老先生翻一翻腹中的四書五經，名人格言，或是名人小辭典，提一句警句，取一個學名，這不過是名字的開始，假使高興的話，那没小順子，珠兒，瑪琍由你去變罷！</p>
<p>假使你的大名祗不過像蚊虫呌（不是如雷灌耳），那没不發生什麽問題，萬一你的大名像無敵牌牙粉，亭達利鐘錶行一般響，那没如有和你同名同姓或同音的人，你便要認爲有存心假冒影射的歉疑，於是就要登一個啟事，··，凡本人之信札，均以本人之圖章爲憑····「，不過啟事是啟事，可是不能干涉别人的同名同姓，不能像無敵牌牙粉一般到法庭裏去起訴，因爲法律上還没有這樣的一條啊！而且近年來大槪因爲人口衆多和敎育普及的緣故吧，同姓名者愈弄愈多了，這眞使名人名媛們多麽煩惱的一回事啊！不要說名人名媛，就是投稿者也要因此多蓋一個印，　　　　　　　現在我想得一個妙法，就是請公家辦　　一個「人名登記處」或是「人名註册」局」；凡是一個人取了名字便得去登記註册，假設碰到有同名同姓者，那没就得改名，或者像天祿，老大房一般下面加一個Ｘ記，這樣一來，中華民國的民法上也可以添「不准同姓同名」的一條法庭裏也可以多一種生意，多收一筆堂费。也可以多添幾個缺出來，救濟救濟那般失業的　營者。尤其是當此庫空如洗的時候，這樣也可以多添一種人名稅，眞是一舉數得，</p>

<p>怎樣補過</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我見貴欄的疑難問題，先生解答正確，無微不至？這次我也有一件疑問，請先生指敎。</p>
<p>女友某，現年念六歲，體專畢業：數月前與余發生關係。其後欲謀永久之計，遂徵求同志二位，創設某小學。該校尙稱發逹，惟收費底微，敎員完全盡義務之後，每學期尙虧三四百元。二同志因無希望，願意抛棄；同時我倆亦時閙意見。現在校中經費及敎務，無人負責。於這情形之下，究竟維持下去好呢？還是停辦好？維持有以上的困難，可否依合同議决案交涉？停辦學費已收，又無法發還，對於法律上有無抵觸？　　至於吾倆的秘密，近因意見不和，她竟將戀史向親戚朋友公開。依此情形，恐發生事故。倘發生時，對於法律上有無干係？現在深思以上的問題，想不出一個妥善的辦法，因此懇求</p>
<p>先生在貴刋細答覆。不勝感激之至。敬頌撰安。</p>
<p>徐一成謹啓</p>
<p>編者按：徐君與女友中間的一段葛藤，倒並不十分嚴重。她今年已經二十六歲了，非未成年的女孩可比；除非她能夠提出强有力的證據，足以證明當時徐君曾用强暴脅迫詐術毒物或催眠術等不法手段外，她究竟不能憑空說一句「上當」。你們發生關係後，爲圖求永久之計，採取合作經營的方式，足見兩方並没有正式結婚。所以你倆中間的關係祗可認爲彼此同意的苟且行爲，並没有任何拘束的效能。在這種關係之下，意見相反，一直繼續下去可也；一旦感情不合，走開了就是了。俗語所謂各走各的獨木橋可也。</p>
<p>至於你們辦的那個學校，照來信看來，現在弄到經濟敎務，無人負責，不久並且有圖窮匕見之勢，倒不容不想個辦法，藉資彌補地。否則萬一經人告發，那末「局騙」，「借學歛錢」，以及「貽誤靑年」等一類的罪名，會一重一重加到你頭上，而無法脫缷呢！原夫創設學校，是一種服務社會的事業，决不是一種個人的企業。事前須有充分的準備，雄厚的基金，才能開始。今徐君與其女友以及兩個同志，或則視學校爲香巢，或則視學校爲利源，辦學之動機已錯，當然不會有良好之結果。幸甗不及半年，已成强弩之末，否則貽害靑年，將無底止，而徐君等之罪，更上通於天矣。爲今之計，惟有由出面辦學之人，準備現金，通知學生家族，申明無法維持的情形，請他們將學費領回，作速轉學，俾輕罪　。一面再　　合同。由各　辦交涉。</p>

<p>阿念　糖炒栗子香咧！（坐在小帆布凳上工作的阿念張望了海山一下）</p>
<p>海山　（狀極鄙屑）香，香，你想吃是不　　　哪？</p>
<p>阿念　我們有飯吃就算好了。</p>
<p>海山　（手裏的一握栗壳丢上阿念頭上，眼向着志大）志呀，擲銅子眞好玩呢</p>
<p>志大　我倒還没有試過，今天看你們擲的怎樣？或者我也來試試！</p>
<p>海山　眞好玩咧！你擲一擲就會曉得的。</p>

<p>志大　海呀，當眞你說來玉連環我就紀起了，昨天姊姊要我向攤頭上去借咬奶記，那老頭兒說你早已借去了，看完了没有啦？借給我好吧！</p>
<p>海山　天曉得咧，那天我借來，因爲擲銅子，便順手放在這石磴上（手指着跟前的一條石磴）後來就不見了。（稍停）我還没有看呢，據那老頭兒說，是一部頂括括的書，若是眞的失了，至少要我賠兩隻洋，看倒霉不倒霉呢！志呀，你别尋我的開心吧，是不是你檢拾去了？</p>
<p>志大　没有，没有！（正色的說）</p>
<p>海山　那一定是小皮匠偷去了，那天癩　　頭没有來賣報！</p>
<p>阿念　媽的，老子偷你們的鬼書呀？自　　已還忙不了！當心點咧，不然老子給你響兩個耳光！海山　想不到这幅窮相、倒這麽兇咧！</p>
<p>阿念　我窮我的，關你什麽？媽的，說　　老子偷了你的書呀！</p>
<p>志大　再兇，我就抓你到局子裏去吃官司！</p>
<p>阿念　誰敢？我又没有犯法！媽的！（丢下工作，站將起來。）</p>
<p>海山　快莫理他了，同他這樣的賤骨頭鬥嘴，反低了顏色。（揮手止住志大的帮閒）</p>
<p>志大　本來没有偷就没有偷好了，看他這麽兇咧，我眞不服氣呢！（有點紳衿腔板）</p>
<p>海山　呵，那頭腦光光的傢伙來了，在那兒，在那汽車後來了，志呀，瞧見了没有啦？</p>
<p>志大　就是他呀，他倒會擲銅子噢！</p>
<p>海山　門檻蠻精呵！（色飛眉舞起來）</p>

<h3>招出路　士本</h3>
<p>目今的中國，外受「帝國主義」的武力侵略，經濟勢力的威脅榨取，内遭「匪共」的蹂躏，「兵水災」的摧殘，直弄�</p>
<p>得焦頭爛額！不堪設想。在這天災人禍的惡劣的恐怖的形態之下，便促成了農村經濟的崩潰，社會狀况的衰落，一個素稱花花世界」的中國，到處映射着普遍化深刻化的死亡的不景氣象。</p>
<p>在工業凋蔽商業蕭條農村破產一切的一切都呈阢隍不安的恐怖的趨勢中，便造成了普遍化收縮現象，不管商店機關都實行「緊縮政策」，忙着裁員减薪！以圖挽救牠各個的將滅的殘燈。在這「收縮」的危機之下，便產生了成千成萬的無數的失業羣衆！</p>
<p>人生最痛苦的事情，莫過於失業，物質恐慌，精神頽喪，較之怎麽「失戀」其痛苦奚啻百倍，不過「事非經過不知難」，在没有嘗過失業味况的人，總以爲余言之過甚，但在下不久以前就嘗過這失業的滋味，有三年之久，所以認識到這「失業的痛苦」的確是眞正的痛苦，至今一聞到「失業」兩字，就像「驚弓之鳥」般怵目驚心不寒而慄！</p>
<p>在這衰落的社會中，被淘汰下來的失業同志聽着：你們失了業，天然要趕緊地去，「招謀出路」，以求解决「麫包」問題，這，的確，無產階級的生命線，就是「職業」，一旦失了業，這生命綫斷了，當然要千方百計地去想法補救，不然，難道你是個傻子不想活命麽？不過在下想來，在現實的社會裏，講到這「招</p>
<p>出路」三字，確有些不容易！因爲我在三年的失業中間，着實被我認淸了這萬惡的社會的本來面目，是一個「世態炎凉」的猙獰可怕的「刻薄勢利者」。一旦失了業，跑去央求幾位「故舊知交」，你休想再看得見他以前在你有職業時應酬你的一付「温厚親熱」的面孔，不是說句刻苛的話，十人中倒有九人，一定是像煞有介事地板起面孔很冷淡地回答你，怎麽「人浮於事」「謀事困難」「實行緊縮」難以効勞「等等的廢話，好像不這樣冷冰冰地對付你，你身上窮氣馬上就會過給他的。但話又要說轉來了，倘然你和你所央求的這位朋友，有甚麽「裙帶關係」，或則有點點「背影作用」，那麽可以斷定他决不會把上面這種樣子對付你的，一定也會毫勿猶疑地答允你的要求哩！假使你和你所央求的這位朋友，一没有「裙帶關係」，二没有「背景作用」而</p>
<p>也會答允你的要求的，這末一定是你自已身上有兩件「法寳」，是「法寳」效力，而並不是情誼上的效用呀！這是什麽兩件法寳呢？就是「拍馬」「吹牛」咧！所以一個人失了業，想去招謀出生，必須先要問問自已有没有這「裙帶關係」「背景勢力」「拍馬，吹牛，」三個條件，有了其中一個，方有意想不到的效力否則任憑你怎樣去鑽謀請託，跑穿脚底，也絲毫得不到效力的咧！</p>
<p>這是在下失業三年所得到的一些經騐呀！</p>

<p>(Beiping) Although the issue of changing the director of the Public Security Bureau here has previously escalated into a problem between Huang Fu and the old Northeastern Army generals, and contains a major crisis, this afternoon, Zhu Ruilin, the chief of the First District of this city, has been appointed as the acting director of the Public Security Bureau. Starting tomorrow, the handover procedures should be handled, and the turmoil can be declared over. It is known that Zhu Ruilin graduated from Meiji University in Japan. Regardless of whether it is dealing with Chinese or foreigners, especially with the Japanese residing locally, he is considered a suitable person. Furthermore, looking at this matter from the perspective of both parties' honor, the situation can be called a satisfactory resolution. If Bao Yulin were to stay in office, Yu Jinhe's honor would not be preserved, and Huang Fu would be in a difficult position. If they stubbornly insisted on Yu Jinhe's original case, there was fear that the gradually calming North China would once again provoke unnecessary turmoil. Therefore, to preserve the face of the Central Government and He Yingqin while considering both sides, the best way to break through the difficult situation was to have a third party come forward as an agent.

<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu Provincial Government submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan to allocate a loan of 20 million yuan in American cotton and wheat to organize a reclamation special zone, promote cotton and wheat, and methods for raising and repaying the funds: (A) It is requested to allocate 20 million yuan in American cotton and wheat, to be allocated in two or three installments, with an annual interest rate of five percent; (B) The entire loan is guaranteed by collecting a water conservancy fee of two yuan per mu per year on the 1.3 million mu of benefited land in the reclamation special zone, totaling 26 million yuan. The collection method will be determined by the Jiangsu Provincial Government based on land grade, direct benefits, indirect benefits, and related special projects. The 10 million yuan in rural loans should be guaranteed by all the reclaimed land of the agricultural cargo borrowers, and the rural cargo lending department is responsible for organizing it to ensure security; (C) The receipt and payment of cotton, wheat, and cash will be managed by the supervisory committee organized by the Economic Committee of the National Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government; (D) The designated use is for the construction of water conservancy projects in the reclamation special zone and for subsidizing rural loans; (E) The special zone will be used to specialize in American cotton and improved wheat varieties to achieve self-sufficiency in cotton and wheat raw materials. According to Dong Xiujia, the income statistics after reclamation show that if all cotton is planted, 80 jin of seed cotton per mu can produce 10.4 million dan of cotton per year. Assuming each dan of seed cotton is 17 yuan, the value is 176.8 million yuan. Furthermore, if wheat is planted in all seasons after three years, with a yield of five dou per season, 6.5 million dan of wheat can be produced per year. With a value of five yuan per dan, 32.5 million yuan of wheat can be produced per year. The total annual value of both is 209.4 million yuan, which can resist most of the import of foreign cotton and wheat.

The following programs have been confirmed: Yu Zhongxian (15th), Tao Leqin (16th), Cao Zhigong (17th), Hu Fengxiang (18th), Ye Jiaxing (19th), Liu Zhongying (20th). Conference Declaration</p>
<p>We originally did not want to host a national goods exhibition. We believe that an exhibition is to compare the progress of goods, especially the progress of certain goods. For example, a textile exhibition would display cotton seeds, cotton plants, cotton, cotton wadding, cotton yarn, cotton clothing, cotton fields, and textile machinery, allowing people to compare the quality and promote competition and improvement. As for national goods, there is no need to hold any exhibition. All stores, stores run by Chinese people, should display national goods for people to see, browse, and purchase. It is pathetic to say that small-capital stores can still display national goods for people to see and buy, but large-capital, high-rise business premises, the people running them, most of them are highly educated, have a global perspective, but almost 100% of the things they display for people to see and buy are not national goods. If this situation does not change, even without the economic, political, and military oppression of the Japanese, China will surely perish, and the Chinese nation will disappear. What is this talk? Many people, especially wealthy people, think that if we have money, we are not afraid of anything. The so-called "having money means not being afraid of buying anything when you need it." They always think that for everything, if China does not produce it, they can buy it. What is even worse is that they only know the products of modernization and science, but do not know the reality. We believe that "non-national goods" are willing to come because there are "national goods" to exchange. If there are no national goods to exchange, there must be gold and silver to exchange. If all of our country's gold and silver are exchanged for "non-national goods," then "non-national goods" will not be willing to come. At that time, everything will be gone, and death from freezing and starvation cannot be avoided. This is not a dream, nor is it crazy talk. In countries in Central Europe, just after the end of the European War, they encountered this phenomenon. We should wake up, we should understand. Mr. Lin Kanghou said, "The foundation of a country is not in the cities, but in the countryside. The demise of cities is not enough to destroy a country, but the decline of the countryside is the fatal wound of the country." This is truly reasonable. Just look at the decline of the countryside now, which has not yet reached its extreme point, and it has already made the commerce of the cities scattered and disorganized. In another year or two, honestly, our very decent Shanghai, although it will not be like it was eighty years ago, it will at least be like Hankou after 1911. President Roosevelt of the United States said, "Within a country, if half of the people are wealthy and half are impoverished, there can never be lasting prosperity." We can say that in China today, the countryside is declining everywhere, and the cities are gradually becoming unpresentable. The impoverished people, to say the least, are already 70% of the population, and all the capital in the country that is sufficient to build national goods is gathered in our Shanghai, the leader of the cities. According to Shanghai's current deposit statistics, as of June 29th of this year, Chinese banks have 46.45 million taels of silver ingots and 18.086 million yuan, while foreign banks have 89.717 million taels of silver ingots and 8.635 million yuan. If all the silver deposits were used to develop our country's industries, it would still feel insufficient. However, the silver held by foreign banks is not something we can use freely. Moreover, the amount we can use is actually used for making efforts on "mud" and "paper," without producing even half a penny's worth of national goods that can be enjoyed by people. We are powerless to develop national goods, we are powerless to awaken the big merchants who work on "mud" and "paper" and traffic in "non-national goods." We can only make beggar-like cries, we can only hold an exhibition like a village opera or a temple fair, and ultimately hope that, like Dr. Sun Yat-sen's National Revolution, it will gradually become a widespread and lasting national goods movement in our country. Our final wish is that foreign goods stores will only be opened by foreigners, and Chinese people will only sell national goods for people to buy, and even more hope that there will no longer be instances like using Japanese bottles to package Yantai beer, no longer be instances of replacing "non-national goods" with national goods. Slogans and Oaths</p>
<p>(1) Promoting national goods is the national duty of every citizen. (2) Promoting national goods is the foundation of strengthening the country. (3) Promoting national goods is resisting the enemy. (4) Promoting national goods is realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. (5) I am Chinese, I love using Chinese goods. (6) National goods save the nation, it is the late Premier's legacy. (7) Promoting national goods is the basic work for saving the country and wiping out disgrace. (8) Use national goods for all necessities of life, clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. (9) Patriotic people must first purchase and use national goods. (10) Using national goods demonstrates the glory of the Chinese nation. The original text of the oath is as follows: We swear with utmost sincerity to use national goods to fulfill our national duty. Having sworn, we will never waver. We solemnly swear. Entertainment to Add to the Fun</p>
<p>The National Goods Exhibition will set up an entertainment area to help add to the interest of customers. Customers who purchase goods will receive entertainment vouchers from the stores to enter the area and enjoy the entertainment. Today, the entertainment area will hold an opening ceremony, and Ms. Hu Die has been specially invited to cut the ribbon. There will also be Yi Fangshuo's "Great Crying Song," martial arts performances by the National Martial Arts Academy, and film screenings by Tianyi, Huacheng, Meicheng, and Huawei. Ma Zhanshan's Office to Close</p>
<p>Lang Guanpu to go north to meet Ma after closure</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan has already gone north to Tianjin for a temporary rest. His office in Shanghai is managed by Lang Guanpu, the former acting chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government. Now that Ma has left Shanghai, the issue of the resettlement of Ma's subordinates has also come to a temporary conclusion. Therefore, it has been decided to close the office completely at the end of this month. After the office is closed, Lang Guanpu will go north to meet Ma and report everything.

Our association recently submitted a document to the provincial party department, stating: We read in the September 8th newspaper that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's 94th meeting resolved on the "Regulations for the Levying of Perpetual Tenancy Tax in Jiangsu Province," with the following key points: (1) For any transfer of tenancy rights on cultivated land or pasture land, a tax of five silver dollars per mu will be levied, to be paid by the perpetual tenant; (2) For any land with perpetual tenancy characteristics after the implementation of these regulations, if there is no contract or the contract is lost, a supplementary contract must be established and taxes paid within three months from the date of promulgation of these regulations to obtain a certificate; (3) Those who exceed the three-month deadline will be penalized with a fine of one times the tax payable, two times for exceeding six months, and three times for exceeding one year; (4) If the perpetual tenant violates the regulations and delays in paying taxes, anyone may report to the county government with responsibility. After verification, 30% of the charged fines will be awarded to the reporter; (5) These regulations will be implemented upon resolution and promulgation by the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee, etc. Upon reading this, our association is extremely shocked. In recent years, there have been frequent floods and droughts, resulting in poor harvests. Coupled with low grain prices harming farmers, tenant farmers' income is insufficient to pay land rent, and their livelihoods cannot be maintained. The countryside is increasingly heading towards bankruptcy. The central government is seeking to provide relief, yet the Jiangsu Provincial Government is enacting such harsh policies that exploit tenant farmers at this time, is it not a strange thing? Since ancient times, national taxes have only been levied on landlords, never on tenant farmers. Under our party's slogan of relieving farmers of their suffering, there is actually a strange phenomenon of taxing tenant farmers, is it not heartbreaking? The case of continuing to levy an additional two yuan per shi of grain transport tax is being discussed for cancellation, yet they are intensifying the exploitation, squeezing the remaining blood and sweat of tenant farmers. Although the members of the provincial government are clever in their calculations, how can they possibly bear the burden of dying tenant farmers? The law does not pursue past actions, but now, those without contracts or with lost contracts must supplement contracts and pay taxes, the level of exploitation is meticulous and all-encompassing. Anyone can report and be rewarded, giving local ruffians the opportunity to extort money, making it impossible for good farmers to live in peace. The establishment of taxes must be approved by the Central Political Conference, as clearly stipulated by the central government. However, these regulations were resolved and promulgated by the Provincial Government Committee, showing a lack of respect for the central government. The various absurdities are difficult to fully describe. In short, this action by the Jiangsu Provincial Government is exploiting dying farmers, accelerating rural bankruptcy, provoking farmers' resentment, and creating propaganda material for reactionaries. After heartbreakingly considering the situation, our association cannot remain silent. Therefore, we respectfully submit this document to your association for review and request that you promptly forward it to the central government for strict prohibition in order to protect a lifeline for farmers and maintain the inherent credibility of our party. It is for the benefit of both the party and the country. We urge everyone to advocate for this matter and rise up to strive for it in order to alleviate the hardships of farmers and maintain the lives of the people. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Shanghai County Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. The Stamp Tax and Tobacco Bureau Explains That the New Tax Does Not Increase the Burden on Wine</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco Bureau yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, explaining that the fixed tax on Shaoxing wine does not increase the burden on wine merchants. The original letter is as follows: Regarding the Ministry of Finance's Tax Document No. 9100, concerning the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's telegram on behalf of the Shaoxing Wine Industry Association, stating that the fixed tax on Shaoxing wine has increased the burden, please forward it for relief. It is proposed that the fixed tax on Shaoxing wine be re-determined in a moderate manner to demonstrate fairness. After investigation, the Ministry found that the previous excise tax was 20% of the wholesale market price of tobacco and alcohol. If, as stated in the original letter from the association, the tax was 56 cents per 100 jin last year, then the wholesale market price of Shaoxing wine per 100 jin was only 2.8 yuan, which is extremely low. Furthermore, the letter only refers to the price of rice when discussing the cost of making wine per 100 jin, which is not in line with the meaning of the word "cost," which should include all expenses. Moreover, the wholesale market price includes more than just the cost. The association's deliberate misinterpretation is inappropriate. However, regarding the statement that "the Shaoxing wine merchants paid 56 cents per dan last year to the tax collection sub-bureaus, and the merchants all have receipts issued by the Ministry of Finance as proof," it is necessary to investigate how the bureau previously collected the Shaoxing Wine Association's excise tax and how the current fixed tax is determined. The original telegram from the chamber of commerce should be copied and sent to the bureau so that it can promptly investigate the situation and inform the merchants to avoid further misunderstandings. A report should also be submitted for consideration, which is of utmost importance. This order, etc. Upon receiving this, after reviewing the various points stated by the Shaoxing Wine Industry Association, most of them are based on established practices or deliberate misinterpretations, lacking sufficient justification. When this bureau collected the excise tax on tobacco and alcohol, Massachusetts stipulated that the excise price of Shaoxing wine per 100 jin in each district should be 10 yuan in both the production and sales areas. The excise tax should be 2 yuan based on 20%. However, in the past, the heads of each sub-bureau handled it flexibly, and the amount of tax collected was based on the estimated amount, and merchants used the sub-bureau's estimated amount as the standard for apportioning and paying taxes. Over time, the excise price was arbitrarily discounted, deviating from the regulations, and excise receipts were often not submitted. The number of taxes collected was significantly different from the regulations, and this bureau cannot recognize this as legal. Previously, when the sub-bureaus reported the actual amount of Shaoxing wine excise tax collected, which did not match the fixed amount, repeated instructions were issued to reject it. This time, when reviewing the fixed tax rate, after investigating the completed cases of tax collection by each sub-bureau, the Jiangning sub-bureau collected the tax at the fixed rate, totaling 2 yuan per 100 jin at the sales price of 10 yuan, and all files are available for verification. This district is a major sales area and can be used as a benchmark. The fixed tax rate of 2 yuan for Shaoxing wine is not an increase compared to the previous regulations. The Shaoxing Wine Industry Association's claim of "paying 56 cents per dan" has no basis in this bureau's regulations. The amount privately discounted and collected by the various sub-bureaus has already been rejected by this bureau and cannot be used as a basis for claiming an amount that does not comply with the regulations. Moreover, the previous 2 yuan was stipulated by the regulations ten years ago, and the Jiangning sub-bureau did collect it. If we consider the current market price of Shaoxing wine, which is more than 10 yuan, then this fixed tax rate is still based on the old amount and can be considered a fair assessment. Merchants cannot hide the long and take the short, using the shortcomings of one place as an excuse for opportunistic arguments. As instructed previously, in addition to submitting a response, please check and inform the association to notify the merchants to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations and not to make false accusations. To the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The Municipal Land Bureau Measures the Zhabei and Pengpu Districts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating: Regarding the matter of the Zhabei District's Guan Er Tu Yangxu Jianxu and the Pengpu District's Jin Er Tu Dongjianxu and Xijianxu, which were measured by the Baoshan Land Survey Bureau more than twenty years ago, the terrain of roads and rivers in each Tu Xu has undergone many changes and urgently needs to be re-measured for reorganization. The bureau is now beginning the measurement, and the owners of the land in each Tu Xu should pay attention to the following: (1) The Dibaos (local security chiefs) will distribute reporting forms to the landowners. Each landowner should fill out the form truthfully within ten days of receiving it and return it to the Dibaos for collection and delivery to the No. 1 Survey Team of this bureau at No. 12, Lane 619, Tiantong Road, or the landowner can send it directly to the survey team; (2) For landowners whose addresses are unknown, resulting in the reporting forms not being distributed, they can directly go to this bureau or the No. 1 Survey Team to fill out the forms themselves; (3) Landowners who have their title deeds pledged and cannot fill out the landowner's name and mu (unit of land area) should promptly copy the information from the pledgee and should not make excuses; (4) When the land of each household is measured, the landowner must, together with the Dibaos, clearly point out the boundaries to the investigators or surveyors, or entrust a representative to point out the boundaries on-site. Otherwise, this bureau will only rely on the Dibaos' instructions, and if there are any errors in the future, the responsibility will be borne by the landowner. The above four items are all related to the landowner's consolidation of property rights. In addition to instructing the Dibaos of each Tu to comply, this notice is hereby issued for general knowledge. All landowners must pay special attention to this matter. This announcement. You Guocai Denies Compromise with Wang Jialie in Telegram to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai branch of the Shenshi News Agency, Deng Mingjie, the representative of Liu Xiang stationed in Shanghai, received a telegram from You Guocai yesterday, absolutely denying the previous report that the chairman of Guizhou Province, Wang Jialie, had met with You's representative, Liao Yinxiang, to discuss a compromise. Therefore, the situation in Guizhou Province is unlikely to dissipate immediately. The original telegram is as follows: Deng Mingjie, Sir: According to a Beijing telegram, news from Beijing and Shanghai reports that Shao Wu (i.e., Wang Jialie) sent a telegram on the 9th, requesting that Cai send representative Liao Yinxiang to the province to discuss the resettlement of our troops multiple times, and that a general agreement has been reached, etc. I am extremely surprised. The reason why Cai sent Liao Yinxiang to the province was because Shao Wu and Nu Gang (Yunnan representative Dan Nu Gang) sent telegrams urging Wu Jianping to go to negotiate peace. Cai believed that Jianping, as a division commander, could not easily go, so he sent Yinxiang to deal with them. He did not bear any responsibility. The so-called peace negotiation conditions were revised by Nu Gang from what Zhi Gong (Long Yun) proposed. Cai, out of respect for the mediators, negotiated back and forth to ease the situation. As for the Qingxiang commander and the second division commander, they are purely fabricated. Zhi Gong does not even know about them. The provincial government is creating this smokescreen because it has suffered repeated setbacks in the east, confusing the public and at the same time asking the central government and the special envoys of Guangxi to send Cai out. Messengers come and go, but they do not contradict each other. Shao Wu can be said to be versatile. If Shao Wu has any awareness and the situation in Guizhou Province gradually improves, Cai would be very willing to retire, so why wait to be resettled? The problem is that the troops have formed defense zones, and all supplies are requisitioned locally and paid in unbacked paper money, extracting cash. What is even worse is that they are pre-collecting Ding grain and tobacco tax, setting an unprecedented example in Guizhou. All the exploitation is only for personal pleasure and the purchase of military equipment. Not long ago, 3,000 rifles were shipped back from Guangdong, and Zhang Yunliang was sent to Hong Kong to order 5,000 rifles, 3 million bullets, and 30 machine guns. Guizhou has been drained and cannot be exploited any further. Now, they are using excuses to ask the central government for funds, regardless of the name, but in reality, they are buying arms. Cai sits idly by and cannot dissuade them, pacing around the room, at a loss. Gentlemen and fellow villagers abroad, who love their homeland, must have a plan to save this disaster. I hope to receive your instructions. I am anxiously awaiting your reply. Respectfully, You Guocai. The China Merchants' Electric Tramway Second Circular Route Opens</p>
<p>The China Merchants' Electric Railway Company has converted the Route 2 tram into a circular route to facilitate passenger travel and avoid tram turnarounds. A new branch line has been built from the Old West Gate to Heping Road Nanyang Bridge, connecting Fangbang Bridge and Hugunying, etc. The construction of the branch road connecting the Old West Gate to the Nanyang Tree section has been completed, but the construction of the branch road connecting Hugunying, etc., will take some time. The project is being rushed to completion, and the original plan to open the route on the 15th of this month has been postponed to the 20th due to the incomplete construction. A trial run will be conducted on the 19th. The route will run from Nanyang Bridge, through the Old West Gate, Shangwen Road, turn into Daxing Street, pass in front of the Local Court, the back door of the South Railway Station, through Hugunying, then along the Bund Xuejiabang, Guan Bridge, and reach Xiaodongmen, then from Dadongmen, Xiaonanmen, Xiaoximen, Lao Simen, and back to Nanyang Bridge, etc. The company's traffic department, led by Lu Zhonglin and Du Ningru, is preparing the procedures for implementation. The Shanghai Lawyers' Association Responds to Xu Yunxuan's Letter</p>
<p>Regarding Wang Shuqiao's Detention by the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>After lawyer Wang Shuqiao was detained by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, his wife, Ms. Xu Yunxuan, sent a letter to the Shanghai Lawyers' Association, requesting rescue and asking the association to explain five legal questions. Yesterday, the Lawyers' Association replied to Ms. Xu, stating in its letter: Regarding the previous matter of lawyer Wang Shuqiao being wrongly detained, please rescue him and explain the five questions raised. In addition to already taking measures to rescue him, we now answer the questions raised in the letter as follows: Original Question (A): The Municipal Public Security Bureau has transferred the detention for more than forty days. Can it permanently refuse the interrogation by the First Special District on the grounds that the investigation is not yet complete? (B) Can the Municipal Public Security Bureau's investigation of the case be delayed for a long time without sending it to the court for trial? (Answer): The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau only has the power to investigate crimes equal to that of a prosecutor and does not have the power to detain. After discovering a criminal suspect, except in necessary circumstances, he should transfer the suspect to the competent prosecutor for investigation within three days, as clearly stipulated in Article 227 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Necessary circumstances include, for example, evidence is about to be destroyed, accomplices are about to escape, or a search must be carried out with the suspect, or the suspect suddenly becomes seriously ill, or transportation is obstructed and the transfer cannot be made (refer to Interpretation No. 306 of the Judicial Yuan). This type of exception should be strictly interpreted and should not be arbitrarily continued for detention. Regarding Wang Shuqiao's case, in addition to transferring the case to the competent prosecutor in accordance with the law, he cannot be detained for a long time, nor can he refuse the recall by the Shanghai Second Special District Court. Original Question (B): It is rumored that the Municipal Public Security Bureau must wait for Minister Song's instructions to resolve the matter. Can Minister Song's instructions resolve the matter by other means without going through legal procedures? (Answer): A criminal defendant cannot be prosecuted and punished except in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law and its special laws on criminal procedure, as clearly stipulated in Article 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Wang Shuqiao's suspicion of committing a crime, according to reports, is suspicion of assassinating Song. Judging from the nature of the crime, it is a substantive criminal offense. Regardless of whether Minister Song has any instructions, he should be handled in accordance with the criminal procedure and there is no room for applying other punishments. Original Question: Is it not necessary to seek other evidence in the First Special District? Zhou Zhizhang's confession under torture is ironclad evidence? (Answer): If, as stated in the letter, Wang Shuqiao's suspicion of committing a crime is based only on Zhou Zhizhang's confession in the police station, and Zhou Zhizhang has stated in court that the confession was obtained under torture and is completely inconsistent with the facts, then the evidence of Wang Shuqiao's suspicion of committing a crime has been fundamentally shaken and cannot stand (refer to Articles 62 and 280 of the Criminal Procedure Law). Furthermore, it is a principle of criminal procedure to discover the truth through direct trial. Evidence that serves as trial material must be directly verified by the trial court (Five Years, Shang Zi No. 547). Unless there are indeed circumstances that make direct trial impossible, the investigation record should not be cited (Three Years, Shang Zi No. 356). The previous precedents of the Dali Yuan have extremely clear explanations. Therefore, if the court has no other evidence, then Wang Shuqiao's suspicion of committing a crime cannot be proven. According to law, Zhou Zhizhang's confession cannot be used as evidence to determine the facts of the crime. Original Question (D): If the Public Security Bureau does not resolve the matter publicly and thoroughly, will Wang Shuqiao be sent back to the First Special District? Even if Zhao's case is resolved, will he still be sent back to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation in Song's case? (Answer): If the Municipal Public Security Bureau does not transfer Wang Shuqiao to the prosecutor of the competent local court, but sends him back to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, then the Shanghai First Special District Local Court can also accept Wang Shuqiao's case of suspicion of assassinating Song in accordance with Article 14, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 17 of the same law. It is not necessary to send him back to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Corresponding reply, I hope you will check.

The central and provincial authorities have strongly urged him to stay. The Ministry of Education has already issued a comforting order. Minister Wang also expressed to others that he would do his best to urge Chen to return to Zhejiang. However, according to another source, a former magistrate of Hangzhou, Mr. Jiang, is secretly working hard to take over the position of Director of the Zhejiang Education Department.Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Principals Joint Meeting to be Held Today    The Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Principals Association will hold a meeting at Zhenjiang Normal School at 10 a.m. today (the 15th). The reasons for this meeting are: (1) The Education Department promulgated the Outline for National Salvation Education and the Method of Integrating Education and Training, requiring all provincial middle schools and normal schools to implement them uniformly from the 22nd academic year, and ordering each school to prepare and submit implementation plans and implementation details to the Education Department for review. In order to thoroughly implement them, it is necessary for each school to jointly study and carry out the methods. (2) The Jiangsu Provincial Games will select athletes to participate in the National Games, and preliminary rounds will be held around the middle of this month. The principals can take this opportunity to visit the Games. (3) Because of the recent change of principals (the principals of Nanjing Girls' Middle School and Suzhou Middle School have resigned and been replaced, and the principals of Wuxi, Donghai, Rugao, and Huaiyin Normal Schools have all been newly replaced), they can gather together to take the oath of office to avoid traveling back and forth. (4) The School Principals Association itself has many new methods and systems promulgated by the Education Department, and each school has common problems that need to be discussed together. It is also necessary to re-elect the standing committee members for the next term, so the meeting will be held today.Central University Hires Yu Binglie as Professor of Architecture    Central University has now hired the master architect Yu Binglie as a professor in the Department of Architecture. Yu's style name is Weicheng, and he is from Wuxi, Jiangsu. In the tenth year of the Republic, he was admitted to the overseas department of the University of Lyon in China and went to France to enter the Lyon branch of the French National Academy of Fine Arts. He has achieved outstanding results in architectural theory and practical design. In the twelfth year of the Republic, he won a first-class medal for his drawing of a train station. Since then, he has won awards for his drawings of water plants, reservoirs, train station electric clocks, consulates, observatories, tower top auditoriums, hospitals, city halls, fountains, and the League of Nations Conference podium. In the nineteenth year, he achieved great success. His drawing of the Chinese Student Dormitory at the University City of Paris won the French National Architect Degree. The design drawing was listed in the highest degree award quota, which was an unprecedented achievement for Chinese students studying architecture in France. French national architect students were awarded the highest degree medal and bonus. The National Art Museum displayed the drawing of the Chinese Student Dormitory and won an honorary medal. Six or seven of Yu's works have been published in famous French magazines. Yu also studied at the Paris Municipal Academy and obtained a degree in urban architecture. This summer, he accepted the invitation of Central University and arrived in Shanghai at the beginning of the month from France. He will come to Central University to teach. In the future, he will make great contributions to Chinese architectural academics and capital construction theory.    It is also heard that Mrs. Yu, Ms. Lu Shoumei, a native of Yixing, is studying music and literature in France, and has also returned to China.Discoveries of the Institute of Botany of the National Academy of Peiping    Mysterious Zone of Plants in the Kunlun Mountains and Tibetan Plateau (Continued)    (Research and Collection)    The working scope of the Institute of Botany is temporarily focused on plant classification, while also involving various issues in plant ecology and distribution. Moreover, due to the location of the Academy of Peiping, special attention is paid to the plants of northern China, including Mongolia, Xinjiang, the Yellow River Basin, and the provinces north of the Yangtze River. (1) Work Procedure: Research work is roughly divided into special work and comprehensive work. In addition to allowing researchers to select a problem that interests them and conduct specialized research in order to make discoveries, plants of major families are assigned to each person for research in order to achieve in-depth study and collaborative efficiency. Comprehensive work includes specialized research and editing work, with a predetermined plan, and hopes to be completed on schedule. Currently, there is one type in progress: 1. The changes in the distribution of plants in northern China are relatively simple, and scholars have studied them relatively early. Therefore, the plants of the north are generally known to us. Unfortunately, the work of previous generations is scattered in various books, and there is no comprehensive flora to provide convenience for future researchers. Since the establishment of this institute, systematic collections have been made in the provinces of North China every year to prepare for editing the Illustrated Flora of Northern China. Moreover, according to natural conditions, northern China is divided into several plant regions, each with its own flora. Currently, Hebei and its neighboring provinces are being compiled. 2. Records of Chinese plants are scattered in various Chinese and foreign magazines and books, which are voluminous and difficult to check. Therefore, we classify, sort, and synthesize them under the name "Compendium of Chinese Plants," so that scholars can use this book as if they had ten thousand volumes of books, and can conduct plant research anytime and anywhere. Its convenience can be imagined. (2) Past Work: The most important work of the institute in the past two or three years is the collection and sorting of specimens. Daily research is mainly based on classification. A. The institute began collecting during the preparatory period. In September of the 18th year of the Republic, Director Liu Zhen'e took time to visit Xishan and Dongling once during the preparation period. Although it was late autumn and the vegetation was withering, not many specimens were obtained, but it was the beginning of the institute's collection. Since then, collections have been made in several places every year, as described below: 1. On May 22nd of the 19th year, Clerk Xia Weiying went to Rehe to collect, but encountered bandits on the way and could not proceed. On June 15th, he transferred to Beidaihe to collect, and returned to the institute on the 24th, obtaining more than 200 specimens. On July 6th, he went to Baihua Mountain to collect, and returned to the institute on August 3rd, obtaining more than 400 specimens. On August 27th, he went to Xiaowutai Mountain and then to Lingshan to collect, and returned to the institute on September 10th, obtaining more than 300 specimens. 2. Assistant Kong Xianwu and Trainee Wang Zuobin went to Xiaowutai Mountain to collect on May 22nd, and returned on June 20th, obtaining about 500 specimens. 3. Liu Shen'e and Wang Zuobin went to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces to collect, departing on June 5th and returning to the institute on September 10th, obtaining more than 1,000 specimens. 4. Kong Xianwu and Trainee Liu Jimeng went to Liaoning to collect, departing on June 5th and returning to the institute on August 18th, passing through Tie Ling, Qianshan and other places, obtaining more than 500 specimens. On August 27th, they went to Xiaowutai Mountain to collect again, and returned to the institute on September 28th, obtaining more than 500 specimens. The above is a general overview of the collections in the 19th year. In addition, several small-scale collections were made in the vicinity of Peiping during the year, such as Xishan and Dongling. (5) In the 20th year, Liu Zhen'e set off from Peiping in May to collect plant specimens and study plant distribution in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Xinjiang, and the north and south routes of the Tianshan Mountains. (6) Kong Xianwu went to Jilin to collect, departing on May 25th of the 20th year, passing through Weihuling, Huangnihe, Dunhua Mountain, Baishan, Jingbo Lake and other places, and returning to the institute on October 19th, obtaining more than 1,000 specimens. (7) Xia Weiying and Clerk Bai Yinyuan went to Inner Mongolia to collect, departing on July 16th of the 20th year, passing through Suiyuan, Baotou, Wuyuan, and Yikezhao Salt and other places, and returning to the institute on September 29th, obtaining more than 800 specimens, including some plants from plateaus, high mountains, and deserts. (8) Trainee Liu Jimeng went to Wuling Mountain, departing on May 25th of the 20th year and returning on July 3rd, obtaining 500 specimens. On August 2nd, he went to Nankou to collect again, and returned on the 14th, obtaining about 300 specimens. (9) Clerk Wang Yunzhang and Wang Zuobin went to Xiaowutai Mountain to collect, departing on June 25th of the 20th year and returning on August 3rd, obtaining more than 400 specimens. (10) In the same year, several small-scale collections were made in the vicinity of Peiping, and in the spring of the same year, they went to Wuling Mountain and collected more than 80 species of living wild plants, which were planted in the botanical garden. (11) There were two batches of departures for collection and investigation in the 21st year: one in the Yellow River Basin and one in the Kunlun Mountains, Tibet, and India. (12) The Yellow River Basin is mostly occupied by sand dunes, and the plant communities with loose, dry, and xerophytic properties are very unique. Clerk Hao Jingsheng of the institute set off in May, advancing westward along the Yellow River, specializing in this kind of research, and collecting at the same time. Wang Zuobin accompanied him, and they went to Xuchang, Zhengzhou, Dengfeng, Songshan, Yuse Mountain, Luoyang, Song County and other places, reaching Shaanxi, and advancing westward from Zhennan and Shangzhou, crossing Huashan, along the Qinling Mountains, and returning to Chang'an, collecting about 1,000 species of specimens. (13) The Kunlun Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau should be a mysterious area of the plant kingdom. Except for a few Europeans who have gone to collect before, no Chinese botanists have set foot in the area. Director Liu Zhen'e of the institute, after collecting in the northern route of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, continued westward through the southern route of the Tianshan Mountains, reaching Yecheng in Xinjiang, entering the Kunlun Mountains, and then through Yutian, Hotan, and Yecheng again, passing through the Kaghakorum Range, and reaching Ladakh in northwestern Tibet. The peaks in the above places undulate, and the growth of plants is very unique. This vast and difficult journey will contribute to plant distribution and ecology. Collecting specimens is secondary. This year (the 22nd), Director Liu went from Ladakh to India, inspected the plants in northern India to Darjeeling, and has now returned to China via Nanyang. (3) Current Work: Except for those who have not returned from collection, the staff of the Institute of Botany are working in the institute. Their work is divided into three categories: sorting specimens, editing plant illustrations, and specialized research. 1. After moving into the new specimen room, we immediately started sorting the specimens for systematic classification and identification of names. This work is very heavy. (2) The Illustrated Flora of Northern China is now completed or about to be completed for the second to fourth volumes. The Compendium of Chinese Plants is also being compiled. (3) Specialized research is currently focused on the classification of seed plants for the convenience of equipment. Each person specializes in one or several families for in-depth study. The families currently being studied include Leguminosae, Gramineae, Rosaceae, Umbelliferae, Compositae, etc. Due to economic constraints, the institute does not seek a wide scope for research, but only strives for specialized and in-depth study. Now that plant classification is the research standard, at a minimum, the plants of northern China, such as Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the provinces along the Yellow River, should be completely investigated in a relatively short period of time, and the Flora of the North should be made as soon as possible, and then the area of plant research should be expanded and various issues other than plant classification should be involved. (Jin Ji)   (This draft continues from the 9th of this month)Local    County Education Bureau Meeting    The Shanghai County Education Bureau held its 305th Bureau Affairs Meeting yesterday.

The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Education stating that if private middle schools have actual needs, they may concurrently establish elementary schools and kindergartens.

<h3>He Indicates that the Other Party is Still Proceeding with the Original Plan</h3>
<p>No Further Movements After Ji's Troops Reached Dushikou</p>
<p>Ruan Xuanwu Sends Telegram Advising Fang Zhenwu</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan sent a telegram from Zhangbei to Fang Zhenwu with a final word of advice. After Fang received the telegram in Dushikou, he sent his secretary Fu Zichuan to the provincial capital. Song replied with three items which the Chahar government relayed to Fang in a genuine telegram from Dushikou, saying, "I am currently arranging everything and will pay my respects whenever I set off. I will send another telegram to inform you of my departure date." (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, Qin Dechun and Xiong Bin visited He to report that Fang had sent a genuine telegram to Zhang. He indicated that the other party was still proceeding with the original plan. After Ji led his troops to Dushikou, there have been no further movements. Zhao Dengyu's division has advanced and is stationed in Huagai Huangshan, preparing for a final military resolution against Ji. Tang's troops, previously stationed in Datan, have advanced to Guyuan. He sent Wang Hongru as his representative to visit Song, requesting to be incorporated into his forces. However, due to Tang's ambiguous attitude, the request was not granted. Recently, a portion of Tang's troops has begun moving from Guyuan towards Dushikou. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ruan Xuanwu sent a telegram to Fang Zhenwu, saying, "Since Song returned to Chahar, the former allies have been well taken care of. Order in the northern parts of Kou has gradually been restored. Only you and Ji Shiwu, leading a portion of the troops, have departed and have not sought the old alliance, merely increasing the disputes of the overall situation. Shiwu has other allegiances, and acts recklessly. Perhaps this is unavoidable. But you, as an advanced member of the party and nation, have willingly confined yourself to the border, living with foxes and rodents. Success is not to be expected, and much has already been lost. Chahar affairs were supported for several months. Feng recognized the overall situation at home and abroad and resolutely left. This shows that resistance against Japan cannot be shouldered by one person or one place alone. If the name of resisting foreign invasion is used, while in reality it is aimed domestically, this is not tolerated by the people. Your dedication to the country this time, sacrificing your family, is sincere and outstanding. Since it began with righteousness, it should end peacefully. Towards Feng, you have a mutual obligation to advance and retreat together. Towards Song, you should have the benevolence to overcome difficulties together. Towards the government, you are a member of the central government. There are many ways to save the country, and many ways to cooperate. I respectfully urge you to deeply consider Song's sincerity and the people's expectations. Set off immediately and come to Zhang, or go to work in the central government, or seek to dedicate yourself to construction. With your great virtue and prestige, whatever you do will be a great contribution. Xuanwu has been under your leadership for ten years as if it were one day. This time, I could not hold you back as you walked alone, which breaks my heart. I respectfully offer my humble opinion and hope you will consider and accept it." (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Russian and Japanese Ambassadors Visit Wang</h3>
<p>Foreign Vice Minister Claims Both Visits Were Courtesies</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi, accompanied by Counselor Horiuchi and translator Yokokawa, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 14th and stayed at the Japanese consulate. Outside speculation believes Ariyoshi's arrival signifies a major turning point in Sino-Japanese relations. According to Foreign Vice Minister Tang Yuren, there was no prior contact regarding Ariyoshi's arrival. However, since he has arrived in Nanjing, Wang, as the concurrent minister, will naturally meet with him. This is a courtesy visit, as various representatives have already met with Wang since he took office, while the Japanese ambassador had not yet done so. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Russian Ambassador Bogomolov arrived in Nanjing this morning in the same car as Ariyoshi. According to Bogomolov, it is still regarding matters of various consulates and there are no other tasks. Ariyoshi also said that he came to Nanjing for a routine courtesy visit to the newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhaoming, and there are no other important matters. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Previously, there were rumors that Wang would telegraph Luo Wengan to concurrently serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs. A member of the Central Committee said that Luo was ordered to go to Xinjiang and had just arrived in the provincial capital. The mission he was entrusted with was just beginning, so how could the government suddenly change its original decision? It is clear that the rumor of a telegraph urging him to return to Nanjing is false. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that reports stated that Foreign Vice Minister Tang Yuren had agreed with the Japanese consul to have Wang, as President of the Executive Yuan, meet with Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi at 6:00 PM today to have a sincere discussion on Sino-Japanese issues. According to the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this news is absolutely false. Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi's visit to Nanjing is purely a courtesy call to the newly appointed concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, in accordance with diplomatic practice, and there is no other task. It is heard that Wang, as the concurrent minister, will receive him at the official residence of the Ministry of Railways at 6:00 PM today, and will also receive representatives from other countries on the same day, all of which are courtesy calls. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 14th and went to the Wuzhou Park in Jiming Temple for sightseeing at 2:00 PM. He returned to the consulate at 4:00 PM. At 6:00 PM, he went to the No. 1 Railway Department to visit Wang with Horiuchi and Yokokawa. Foreign Vice Minister Tang Yuren represented Wang and greeted him at the door, and then led him to the living room. Wang came out to meet him, and they talked for a long time, mostly with polite conversation, and did not mention diplomatic matters. At 7:00 PM, Wang hosted a banquet to welcome him and invited Foreign Vice Minister Xu Mo to accompany him. Ariyoshi and others left after 8:00 PM. It is heard that Ariyoshi plans to stay in Nanjing for a week. The Japanese side claims that Ariyoshi's visit will involve discussions on Sino-Japanese diplomacy, and plans to propose negotiations on a Sino-Japanese commercial treaty to our country, because the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty expired and became invalid in the previous year, and a part of its annex also expired and was abolished on May 16 of this year. Only the tariff agreement remains, which is not enough to replace the commercial treaty. Sino-Japanese commercial relations currently have no treaty to rely on, so it is planned to propose negotiations. If a new treaty can be established immediately, it is hoped that the old treaty will remain valid during the transition period. However, our government naturally cannot recognize the old treaty as valid after it has expired and been abolished. As for the saying of establishing another transitional method, it is still not possible to talk about it at the moment, given the current situation between China and Japan. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There is much speculation about Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi's visit to Wang, who is also the Foreign Minister. Foreign Vice Minister Tang Yuren told reporters on the 14th that since Wang is also the Foreign Minister, according to diplomatic practice, ambassadors from various countries must come to Nanjing to pay a visit. Therefore, the Russian ambassador also met with Wang today, and there is no special task. Although we are fighting with Japan, we have not severed diplomatic relations, and there is no reason to refuse to see the Japanese ambassador. A certain newspaper said that Ariyoshi came to Nanjing to discuss Sino-Japanese issues with Wang, who is also the Foreign Minister, and said that the news was leaked by Japanese diplomats. This kind of report is nothing more than Japanese propaganda, and its impact is extremely bad. I have telegraphed the Japanese consul in Nanjing to investigate this matter, and he also absolutely denied it, which proves that this report is unfounded. Tang also said that Hirota has traveled in Europe for many years, and this time he has taken office as the Japanese Foreign Minister, and may gradually seek closer ties with Europe and the United States, but there will be no changes in his diplomacy towards China. Jiang Zuobin's departure date for Japan has not yet been determined. He recently urged Huang Fu in Shanghai to go north, because the bandit forces in Luan Dong are spreading, and it is not easy for the police to suppress them. If troops are sent to suppress them, it is feared that it will violate the agreement, so he hopes that Huang will go to Ping to preside over the matter. (Fourteenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Russian Ambassador Bogomolov made a special trip to the No. 1 Railway Department official residence at 4:00 PM on the 14th to visit Wang, who is also the Foreign Minister. At 5:30 PM, he visited Tang Yuren, the Permanent Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Shen Jinding, the Director of the Asian Department, and had a conversation. He then left. It is heard that it was a courtesy visit with no special mission. (Fourteenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador Ariyoshi, along with his translator, visited Mr. Wang Jingwei at the Railway Ministry's official residence at 6 PM on the 14th. Mr. Wang and Foreign Vice Minister Tang Yuren greeted him. During the meeting, Ambassador Ariyoshi offered sincere congratulations to Mr. Wang on his assumption of the position of Foreign Minister. He finally took his leave at 8 PM and stayed at the Japanese Consulate. (Fourteenth Japan United News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of whether to postpone the Fifth National Congress, Wang reported at this morning's Central Standing Committee meeting, saying that Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Cai Tingkai telegraphed on the 5th, and that they should jointly reply with a telegram to Chiang. Then Chen, in his capacity as a member of the Central Committee, sent a telegram requesting that the Fifth National Congress be suspended pending a public decision. Most members of the Central Committee stated that the Fifth National Congress should be held in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, and that it was impossible to stop it since the party was built on a system of meetings. If there are factual difficulties, then postponing the event could be discussed within the scope of not violating the Party Constitution. This case should first be submitted to the Standing Committee for detailed study, and then a decision should be made at the next Standing Committee meeting. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Local Nudity</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>China is, after all, China; not as good as the best, but better than the worst, this is what China is. Whether in science, politics, or military preparations, although it is working hard to follow the advanced countries of the world; however, to give an appropriate evaluation, not exactly good, nor exactly bad, somewhere in between; this is what China is.</p>
<p>Just in terms of the degree of nudity of modern women, first bare arms, then bare legs, although the lines of sleeves and trousers have shortened, when retreating to the most important places, they can only desperately hold on, and not the complete retreat of clothes and trousers. Such an incomplete nude movement is not as good as Germany, but better than Morocco, and the degree of nudity is also somewhere in between, this is what the degree of nudity of Chinese women is.</p>
<p>Being women of the same twentieth century, what restrictions are placed upon women of Morocco. What liberation is given to women of Germany.</p>
<p>The women of Morocco are all like the unmarried women described in our country's "Instructions for Women in the Boudoir." Young girls are all forbidden from meeting with members of the opposite sex; "showing one's face" is considered a major taboo by them. Sometimes, when women are forced to go out, they have to cover their faces with a veil to prevent people from seeing their beauty. Since the face cannot be exposed, there is no question of baring arms or legs. Therefore, as a woman of Morocco, no part is allowed to be bare. German women are very enthusiastic about the nude movement; at the time, some people in society also opposed it, thinking that the completely nude movement was a bit shocking. Therefore, a compromise was proposed: to find a way to cover the lower part, and women also had to cover their breasts. However, after many hygienists experimented, they all said that partial liberation, rather than complete liberation, would inevitably reduce the effectiveness of sunbathing. Because of this, the compromise was rejected, and the "not a single thread" sunbathing was implemented. Therefore, as a woman of Germany, no part is prevented from being bare.</p>
<p>The nudity of Chinese women is neither that any part is bare, nor that any part is not bare, but simply a moderate, local nudity.</p>
<h3>Shuttle-like Homecoming</h3>
<p>— Bibo</p>
<p>"The ones who practice old-style literature, according to a recent advertisement in a certain magazine, are referred to with the phrase 'gathering writers from both the old and new schools,' which produces the above-mentioned term." Among the people from other places who travel to Shanghai, Shen Yuzhong used to be considered a regular on the train. Now, Mr. Shen has already thrown away his pen and inkstone, no longer writes, and has even disappeared without a trace. Many friends miss him, but they cannot find out his whereabouts. Has Mr. Shen truly renounced the world?</p>
<p>Anyone who travels frequently between Suzhou and Shanghai is accustomed to and cannot remember all the scenery in the train and Wumen. However, I have to go back once every two or three months. In this long period of time, there are always some changes. The day I went home happened to be the opening ceremony of the Beixin Bookstore. When I arrived at the station at noon, everyone was busy taking pictures. The former lobby still solemnly restored its former appearance, but the iron fences on both sides were locked, and it could not yet provide a place for the public to rest, perhaps because the decoration was not yet completed. That time it was a Shanghai-Zhenshan local train. The passengers were not very crowded. I met Mr. Wu Linzhi and had a long conversation next to each other, which relieved a lot of the loneliness of the journey. Across the way, a man in a Western suit was accompanied by a woman. Her face was very similar to the film actress Fan Xuepeng, but a little thinner, and especially like her were a pair of upward-looking eyes. They got off the train at Kunshan Station.</p>
<p>Arrived in Suzhou at three o'clock, and took a car towards the Cangmen Gate. On the road, perhaps because of the cars that were going to take the Sujia Highway, the road seemed to have been recently repaired much smoother than before. However, it was covered with yellow sand, and when the horse-drawn carriage passed my car, a gust of dust blew up from the front, as if I had arrived in the north. When I walked past Adai Bridge, I felt that the bustling shadows of a few years ago, compared with the desolate and withered scenes I saw today, were simply filled with a sense of vicissitudes. After a few more years, it may become the Qingyang land of today.</p>
<p>I went home to see my family, and before I could say a hundred or so words, I hurriedly left home again. In the hazy evening, I passed Beisi Pagoda and went out of the Pingmen Gate to the train station. On this road, the streetlights were dim, and with a piece of dark clouds, I couldn't even see the person coming from the opposite side. If the rickshaw didn't light that tung oil lamp, the vehicles would have a reckless love, and everyone would have a kissing ceremony.</p>
<p>The eastbound train was already parked at the station. I hurried up, but couldn't find a seat anywhere. Later, I used my wise eyes, and sure enough, in the middle, I found a seat that was missing one person. I asked a Ningbo gentleman's foot to move under the seat. Later, I learned that this gentleman's surname was Tang, and he was doing pharmacy business. There was also one who was an experienced real estate businessman, and one who was a young and handsome banker. They joked and laughed, very intimately. Suddenly they talked about the interest in squash, and agreed that when they arrived at the station, they would hire a car directly to the court to participate in the last few games. They thought highly of me and gave me melon seeds and food to eat, which embarrassed me. Later, as a result of my perfunctory explanation with them, I understood the occupations of the three of them, and also knew that they had gone to Wuxi early that morning, and rushed back to Shanghai overnight, and they had brought two big bags of those Liangxi local products 泥佛 [clay Buddha] and 麵筋 [wheat gluten].</p>
<p>Four Westerners came from Kunshan, three men and one woman. Except for the woman, they were all red-faced, running back and forth in the car, looking for seats. As a result, there was a person next to them who was very keen on harmonious diplomatic relations, and quickly picked up a small child and let the woman sit down. So the three men also stayed next to them, took out beer bottles, and still bone duo bone duo, taking turns drinking, and by the time they got to Shanghai, their faces had turned purple. When I got off the train, there was a light drizzle, and the red lanterns that had been installed at the station had not yet been turned on. Everything else, because I was regretting that I had spent a few dollars, and was only in my hometown for three hours, so I was also confused and didn't bother to look carefully. I jumped on the rickshaw, and told him to pull me to my home in the West. (Actually, it can only be called my Shanghai residence)</p>
<h3>Hearing that Gao Junyou Tang Intends to Resign as Supervisory Committee Member, I Compose This to Keep Him</h3>
<p>— Cui Lintai</p>
<p>I wait anxiously for the people to be freed from their predicament. Why do you put on your hat to be a cicada in winter? The green donkey and the white rabbit are both stubborn. The southern hawk and the northern eagle can stand shoulder to shoulder. If you want to make sure there is no corruption in the center. Don't leave wise men unappointed in retirement. Why boast about Yang Zhen's "four knows"? This old man has never loved money in his life.</p>
<p>The affairs of the world hang by a thread. You stand alone like a cicada in winter. When times are difficult, you should taste bitterness. Don't rest until the government is cleansed. With this uprightness, you shake the imperial court. From now on, you can identify traitors. How can you blame few people for appreciating high art? An honest official is like finding one coin in ten thousand.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Head and Hangzhou Feet</h3>
<p>— Li Pengxiang</p>
<p>"Suzhou head, Hangzhou feet," this is a popular saying in the folk of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It means that the head of Suzhou and the feet of Hangzhou are the specialties of these two places. Of course, the head and feet mentioned here all belong to women. But I think this sentence probably came with the saying "Above is heaven, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou." It is not necessarily that the faces of Suzhou women are particularly exquisite, and that Hangzhou women are particularly good at treating their feet. In the past, the talented scholars, seeing the famous scenery of these two places in the world, with outstanding people and blessed land, thought of the women of Suzhou and Hangzhou, and reluctantly fabricated this kind of head and feet and comments, I am afraid that it is also possible.</p>
<p>But these can all be ignored. Now, the head of Shanghai and the feet of Shanghai have covered the oily hair and powdered faces of Suzhou, and the three-inch golden lotuses of Hangzhou, which I'm afraid no one can deny. If the "female commentators" of those two places refuse to admit it, then they can be invited to Shanghai to take a look at the "black and bright hair," "thin and long eyebrows," and bare feet that are not wearing socks; I think they will definitely be "sincerely convinced" and sigh, "It is no longer what it used to be, the feng shui has changed."</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: The Guest Leaves with Bashful Smiles and Tender Feelings, The Visitor Brings Old News and Starts Worries</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang said a whole bunch of hes, the content of which was unknown, so some would be confused. However, the elder Zhao identified that his son had a she, referring to Guizhi, so after thinking about it carefully, he understood. So he said: If that's the case, this matter is indeed easy to handle. Fortunately, I am a few years older, and with a touch of my face, I can say anything. Now you can just rest assured and take care of your official duties, and I will handle this marriage for you. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: I don't have anything to worry about. The elder Zhao smoked, just smiling slightly. As if he couldn't approve of his son's words. Seeing his father laughing with a bit of a joking meaning, Zhao Ziqiang was even happier, and said: In the future, when I want to buy something, I won't need you to tell Little Lin to make it, and maybe the taste will be even better. Her dishes must be well done. The elder Zhao said: Have you eaten the dishes she made? Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: I haven't eaten them yet. Generally speaking, the elder Zhao must have asked the following question: If you haven't eaten them, how do you know they're delicious? But the elder Zhao kept these words in his stomach. He just smiled and didn't say anything more. Zhao Ziqiang sat and talked with his father for a while, and had nothing else to say. So he said: Dad, I'll go back to the camp first, I'll come back tomorrow. The elder Zhao said: I will naturally act according to the circumstances for you in this matter. You don't have to come if you can't spare the time. Zhao Ziqiang agreed and walked out. When he passed through the front courtyard, he still walked with the heels of his leather shoes making a sound on the bricks. Moreover, when he walked, he coughed slightly a few times. Although this action didn't seem particularly special, in his opinion, it was very meaningful, thinking that Guizhi would know that he was leaving if she heard it in the house, or she might even come out and take a look. But his guess was wrong, Guizhi didn't come out at all. (187)</p>
<p>Wandering in the Arts</p>
<h3>The Three Perfections of "Man Jiang Hong"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Liang</p>
<p>The long novel "Man Jiang Hong" by the famous novelist Zhang Henshui has been adapted into a film script in a highly compressed manner by the Mingxing Film Company. It is directed by Mr. Cheng Bugao, the director of the successful film "Mad Current," and is now being shown publicly at the New Light Grand Theatre.</p>
<p>In this novel, Mr. Zhang focuses on depicting the individual personalities and living environments of the characters. He objectively portrays the depression and weakness of petit-bourgeois artists, pointing out their mistakes more accurately, and his success far surpasses that of "A Laughing Fate." This is because "A Laughing Fate" is full of legendary and heroic elements. Although readers may be captivated by the protagonist in the book for a time, they cannot help but doubt the reality of such characters. In "Man Jiang Hong," this flaw is avoided, and each character has realistic possibilities, making the emotional impact even deeper. The highest condition for art is truth, therefore, "Man Jiang Hong" can be considered a work of art.</p>
<p>Director Cheng Bugao has gained more courage to move forward after earning a reputation for "Mad Current." The film's technical proficiency, set design detail, editing ingenuity, and dubbing harmony with the plot are all excellent. The second condition for art is "goodness," therefore, "Man Jiang Hong" has another guarantee to become a work of art.</p>
<p>With a truthful and excellent script and an excellent director, can this film become a work of art? If there is no "beautiful" performance, this film will inevitably suffer a fatal blow and be aborted. This film stars film queen Hu Die, with Gong Jianong, Yan Yuexian, Gao Qianping, and others in supporting roles, combining script, director, and actors into three perfections. The ultimate goal of art is "beauty," and there is no doubt that "Man Jiang Hong" will become a work of art.</p>
<h3>The Prerequisite Issue of Women's Liberation</h3>
<p>— Jian Xin</p>
<p>"Thus, the hearts of all parents in the world wish for sons not daughters." This is only a description from the Song of Everlasting Regret about how Yang Guifei won the emperor's favor. In reality, for thousands of years in China, the "hearts of parents" have "wished for sons not daughters," and even virtuous scholars are no exception.</p>
<p>Women are inherently weaker than men. In a Chinese society that has always been male-centered, they are subject to bullying and mistreatment everywhere. Although the call for "women's liberation" has been made faintly but continuously, "concubines," "maids," "adopted daughters-in-law," and "prostitutes" still exist in society. Moreover, the facts tell us that the number of "concubines" and "prostitutes" has increased rather than decreased compared to the past. This phenomenon is actually a comprehensive social problem, not a local one. Therefore, the prerequisite for the "women's liberation" movement is to eliminate the feudal forces in society.</p>
<p>The Tianyi Film Company's new silent film "Flying Catkins" depicts the experiences of an unfortunate woman. From a young age, she was disliked by her father and suffered his contempt. The reason her father disliked her was because he held the traditional idea of "valuing sons over daughters." She has a naive and romantic lover, and someone has already proposed marriage for her, but a fortune teller's nonsense breaks up the good marriage. She then becomes a maid in a wealthy family. The master naturally holds the mentality that maids are lowly, and abuse seems justifiable. From the life of a maid, she moves to the life of an adopted daughter-in-law. In name, an adopted daughter-in-law seems to be a step above a maid, but in reality, her life as an adopted daughter-in-law is even more painful than being a maid.</p>
<p>The theme of "Flying Catkins" is to criticize the traditional idea of valuing sons over daughters, the superstitious belief in the five elements and eight characters, and the inappropriate existence of the maid and adopted daughter-in-law system. Therefore, on the surface, "Flying Catkins" seems to be narrating the story of an unfortunate woman, but at its core, it is exposing the evil forces of feudal society. If we sympathize with the unfortunate women like the one in "Flying Catkins" and want to find a way to liberate and help them, the fundamental solution should be to plan how to eliminate the feudal forces in society first.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Financial Expansion Plans Surge Again</h3>
<p>Gold Standard Plunges Twelve Dollars Sixty Cents</p>
<p>Term Silver Exchange Rates and Commodity Prices Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Swap to Start This Afternoon</p>
<p>Due to swap-related factors, the gold market has been stable for consecutive days. Yesterday, overseas telegraphic reports indicated a slight decrease in the Bank of England's rate, while the U.S. bank rate remained unchanged. The British-American exchange rate continued to rise by one and a quarter points, the U.S.-British exchange rate rose by two and three-quarters points, the British-French exchange rate fell by three yuan and one cent, and the U.S.-French exchange rate rose sharply by five points.

Stock prices fluctuated both up and down. The price of London raw gold rose by one shilling and seven pence. However, people's confidence has waned. Furthermore, news reports stated that the U.S. could not avoid implementing a reasonable expansion plan (as reported in this newspaper previously). Initial speculative selling was done early, with prices opening at fourteen or fifteen yuan. Hengyu and others sold aggressively, causing further declines. Hengxingchang, Shengyonglaijin, accelerated their rebound. Bank commitments caused the situation to firm after opening. However, due to uncertain sentiment, dealers sold off U.S. dollars, strengthening the exchange market, which made it difficult for the gold price to sustain. Later, the domestic market continued to strengthen, breaking the ten-yuan mark. However, with general brokers and assistants actively buying, small speculators like Dekang and others profited by covering their positions. Dealers hedged and turned to buying. The exchange market tightened again, and the gold market rose. The situation has remained stable since then, fluctuating within a range. Although there were rumors from overseas telegraphic reports, they had little impact. The premium for refined gold remained at 260 yuan. The ten-to-eleven-month swap will begin at 3:00 PM today. The market conditions for today are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 818 yuan, down seven and a half yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at seven yuan and six jiao.

Zhengjin bought heavily into December U.S. dollars at eight one-two-five. HSBC took January U.S. dollars at thirty yuan. Hongli, Zhifeng, and Yong all advanced, creating a very positive situation. It was anticipated that HSBC would quote the pound at par, while the U.S. dollar would only increase by two five, further rising to eight yuan and eight jiao. Shanghai sold December U.S. dollars at eight one-two-five. Sanjing offered October U.S. dollars at four three-seven-five. Fuchang, Yuanmao, and Yong sold to within seven yuan. Qingfa, Yongzhaofeng, Changqianchangxiang, further sold to four yuan and three jiao, making it difficult to sell December U.S. dollars at nine three-seven-five. Hongli took advantage of the low price to continue buying, and the price leveled out. Huabi and Maijiali took December U.S. dollars at nine three-seven-five. Sanjing also took January U.S. dollars at one two-five. Yifengyong and others also purchased, returning to five yuan and nine jiao. Reuters reported that the U.S. President would raise agricultural product prices by 6% and implement direct expansion. Datong sold consecutive October U.S. dollars at half a yuan and five six-two-five, changing the situation. Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Hengxing, and others sold to three yuan. Huabi took November U.S. dollars at eight seven-five but sold it to the Central Exchange Company at eight one-two-five. Although it rose, it still fell. Sanjing also sold October U.S. dollars at six two-five. The exchange market loosened. Zhifengyong, Wanxing, and Ruikang all sold, with many sellers unloading, falling to one yuan and one jiao. After fluctuating, the afternoon closing price was eight eleven yuan and two jiao. Goods were auctioned at one yuan. After the close, Tongtaichang came in and the price stabilized slightly.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at eight eleven yuan and two jiao. Goods opened at the same price. Hongli, Shunli, and Ruikang all sold.

Zhaofengchang, Yuanchun, Yuanmao, Yonghengyu, Fuyu, and Yuanmao all came in to offer terms. Counterparties traded December at one two-five. October U.S. dollars at six eight-seven-five were difficult to settle, rebounding to three yuan and three jiao. Hengyu and Dachangyong unloaded, to within two yuan. Huabi sold November U.S. dollars at eight seven-five. Qianchangxiang and Yuanmao sold again, falling to zero five jiao. Sanjing sold December U.S. dollars at one two-five, and now it is difficult to sell. Daxingyong came in and the price stabilized. Huabi took December U.S. dollars at one two-five. Zhengjin also bought December U.S. dollars at two five. Yicheng, Zhifengyong, Fuyukang, and others jointly purchased positions, tightening the domestic market and rising to four yuan and eight jiao.

<p>a drop of twelve yuan and six jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price increased because HSBC's U.S. dollar exchange rate increased by two five, to eighty-nine yuan seventy-five. This equated to a gold standard price of eight hundred thirty-four yuan, seven jiao, and eight fen. According to the closing price, the actual price was approximately ninety-two yuan weaker, more than five yuan weaker than the previous close. The accounting price for this month was eight hundred seventeen yuan, and for October was eight hundred eleven yuan.

<h3>London Silver Market Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>National Society, London, 14th Dispatch: The large contract is up zero six two-five. The near-term price is eighteen pence one eight-seven-five, and the long-term price is eighteen pence three one-two-five. The British-American exchange rate opened at four yuan, six jiao, one and a quarter points.</p>
<h3>Highly Frequent Inflow and Outflow of Goods and Loans</h3>
<p>Recently, goods in various industries in Shanghai have been selling very well, with very active sources and destinations. Therefore, the financial sector has also seen particularly frequent inflows and outflows of commercial goods and loans. With more goods and loans, exchange rates, bills, and other items have also increased accordingly, creating a booming market atmosphere. However, since cash was concentrated earlier, the financial sector has been adopting a prudent and tight policy, so the market has not yet been able to relax, which is regrettable. As a result, the interbank call loan rate remains high, at six percent in the morning and afternoon. The discount rate is only two or three percent, and white discounts. Overnight transfer loans in the morning market amounted to over 5.2 million, and new transactions amounted to over 1.3 million. Afternoon market transactions amounted to over 600,000, and transactions in the Small General Association amounted to over 800,000. In terms of bank collections, foreign banks collected over 1.9 million in bill loan silver and over 3.2 million in foreign currency. Special loan collections amounted to over 3.1 million in silver. Various goods exchange, pledge, and other collections amounted to over 5.5 million in silver and over 7.45 million in foreign currency. Warehouse deposits amounted to 500,000 in silver and 900,000 in foreign currency. Chinese</p>
<p>banks collected over 3.67 million in bill loans, over 3.9 million in special loan foreign currency, and over 7.8 million in various goods exchange, pledge, tax, and other collections. Warehouse withdrawals amounted to 800,000. Japanese banks had warehouse withdrawals of 400,000 in silver and 800,000 in foreign currency. Foreign exchange houses collected over 45 million in foreign currency public orders, over 8.45 million in foreign currency discount loans, and over 900,000 in various remittances, with over 500,000 in cash. In foreign currency pledge transactions, because there were very few new transactions, there were more redemptions than new loans yesterday. Redemptions amounted to over 1.2 million, and new loans amounted to only 600,000 to 700,000. There are too many secretly marked coupons currently being sold by silver and money businesses, and their circulation is widespread. Because the inflow and outflow is huge, redemptions yesterday amounted to over 1.4 million, and issuance amounted to over 1.89 million. In total, the inflow and outflow amounted to a huge 3.34 million. The source of customer traffic was 100,000, and the destination for the new currency was 350,000. Furthermore, the total number of exchanged banknotes at the clearinghouse on the 14th was 6,424,457 yuan, four jiao, and seven fen in silver dollars. Among them, 3,883,956 yuan, six jiao, and two fen were in silver dollars, and 2,540,500 yuan and eight jiao and five fen were in remittances.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Small Coins Re-enter the Ninety Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market prices of subsidiary coins generally declined. The price of Jiangnan small coins was the same in the morning and afternoon at 835 yuan and five jiao, down one yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon price. Transactions amounted to 7,500 jiao in the morning market and only 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small coins were weak. The morning price was already one yuan and three jiao lower than the previous afternoon's low price, at 790 yuan with no balance, and the afternoon price actually fell within the mark, to 789 yuan and five jiao. Both markets fell by about two yuan. Transactions amounted to 115,000 jiao in the morning market and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were bought more than sold, so the market price decreased by 1,000 wen, to 313,500 wen. Transactions amounted to 37,620 strings, with a total value of 12,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Markets Continue to Be Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange market remained sluggish, with a trend of rallying slightly and then falling back, or falling slightly and then rebounding. For more than a month, the trend has generally followed this pattern, with no more so-called short squeeze or long squeeze. The reason for this is that most of the unsustainable bulls and bears are secretly swapping positions, and the market is not affected by these larger fluctuations. Therefore, there is no panic short covering or long liquidation on the surface. Both sides are adept at avoiding risks, making the market increasingly sluggish and the trading increasingly slow. Unless there are major changes in the environment, there will be no waves. In the first session yesterday morning, various groups had slightly more buying, improving by one or two jiao, but still without any excitement. In the second session, although the leading stocks continued to improve by one or two jiao, the consolidated salt tax turned weak again. When the market opened in the afternoon, it became chaotic again, with ups and downs intermingling. Most stocks were firm in the morning but weak in the afternoon. The closing transaction was extremely slow, with most unable to open due to a lack of interest. Market prices were slightly weaker by five fen or one jiao. The market price results showed gains of five fen to two jiao five fen, while the consolidated tax for this month fell by five fen, and gold shorts fell by two jiao and a half. There were rumors that holders of 96 shares were organizing a group to demand rectification, so the future of 96 shares is likely to be more turbulent. The total turnover was 4,669,000 yuan, including 9,000 yuan in spot goods and 1,950,000 in futures of consolidated salt tax, 615,000 in National Bonds, 375,000 in 19th Customs Bonds, 880,000 in 20th Customs Bonds, and the remainder in amounts ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 to 300,000.</p>
<h3>New Opportunities Approaching for the New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market was stable on the 13th. Unless there are new developments, the dim and uncertain situation is likely to continue, but new upward opportunities seem to be coming soon. Wheat prices rose sharply, due to strong purchasing power in the East. The Pacific Coast's export of wheat to the East received government subsidies, which stirred buyers. The government's weekly report on cotton conditions was quite good, but pests had not yet been completely eliminated. The market was stable and rising, because the yarn industry in Wosi Street was very active, and Southern hedging was temporarily calm. The total daily trading volume was 730,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 103.65 Up 0.81</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 50.68 Down 0.15</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 29.82 Down 0.18</p>
<p>40 Bonds 86.93 Up 0.01</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Prices Remain Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm, and the situation is relatively stable. With the rise in American cotton, sentiment is slightly higher, but sellers are determined and have no intention of covering positions, and some continue to sell short, so the pressure remains heavy. However, the recent decline has been quite severe, and factories are struggling. Requests for government assistance are prevalent, and the future is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Good Market for Raw Cotton Licenses</h3>
<p>The raw cotton license market opened yesterday, and the bearish sentiment from the previous day had not dissipated, so the downward trend continued. Prices fell by five jiao for each month. After two or three rounds of auction, prices rebounded slightly, as those who profited covered their positions. Prices rose by seven, eight jiao. The market was stable in the afternoon, with prices rising by one, three, and four jiao for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 47,404 bales. Sells included Senkang 1,500 bales, Lichang 1,000 bales, Shenji 2,250 bales, Renfeng 1,000 bales, Yichang 1,050 bales, and Xiesheng 1,300 bales. Buys included Xincheng 1,100 bales, Jifeng 1,050 bales, Tongfu 1,800 bales, Dafeng 3,000 bales, Changfeng 2,750 bales, and Yuanda 1,000 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton License Closing Prices, Changes, and Open Interest</p>
<p>December 1847 Up 7 55,900</p>
<p>September 1804 Up 1.2 39,750</p>
<p>January 1859 Up 8 64,350</p>
<p>October 1820 Up 9 64,600</p>
<p>February 1866 Up 8 20,800</p>
<p>November 1835 Up 9 70,300</p>
<p>Total 315,700</p>
<h3>900 Bales Sold Spot</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales were higher than yesterday. A total of 900 bales were sold by various groups. Prices fell by five jiao. The buying amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Wuhu 20 Shantou 5 Counterparts 45 Zhenjiang 245 Sichuan 60 Guangdong 160 Inland 150 Northern Group 40 Yunnan 140 Jiangxi 30</p>
<p>The cotton market was slightly firmer, because American cotton prices rose. The rumor that the National Government would sell American cotton at a low price was unlikely to be true, so sentiment stabilized, and speculators bought and went long. However, sellers continued to sell, and the amount of selling was substantial. It was said that the shorts were anticipating the arrival of the new cotton season, and large quantities of goods were arriving from various places, so they sold on any price increase. However, foreign firms were buying more and more each day.</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou Raw Cotton Licenses Rise by Two or Three Jiao</h3>
<p>The Zhengzhou raw cotton license market opened yesterday. The rumors were very strong the previous day, and sellers were eager. The November contract was bid up to 40 yuan. Later, buying interest rose, and the market was stronger. As a result, prices rose by one jiao half to two jiao half for each month. The afternoon was calm, and prices did not rise or fall for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 121,000 dan. Sells included Renfeng 5,300 dan, Suilong 2,400 dan, Xincheng 5,400 dan, Yifeng 3,900 dan, Changfeng 6,700 dan, and Deji 3,500 dan. Buys included Dafeng 4,900 dan, Yuanda 3,600 dan, Hengde 3,500 dan, Changhe 6,800 dan, Zhenda 2,500 dan, Changfeng 2,500 dan, and Tongji 2,800 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Raw Cotton License Closing Prices, Changes, and Open Interest</p>
<p>January 4035 Up 20 177,200</p>
<p>October 4095 Up 30 193,000</p>
<p>February 4050 Up 15 93,200</p>

<p>Total 870,000</p>
<p>December 4030 Up 25 196,100</p>

<h3>Shanghai Warehouse Cotton Stock Statistics as of the End of August</h3>
<p>According to a survey by Gaoerting Foreign Firm, the amount of cotton in Shanghai warehouses at the end of August is as follows. Chinese cotton is calculated at 500 pounds (unit: bale).</p>
<p>Cotton Name Bales Cotton Name Bales</p>

<h3>White Wax (Part 2) - Ru Song</h3>
<p>(3) Production and Uses: The highest production is in Leshan, about 7,000 dan per year, followed by Yibin, about 6,400 dan per year; the lowest is Dongchuan, only about 2,400 dan per year. The total annual production is about 15,800 dan. The production is not high, and the uses are also limited. In the past, it was only used for the outer layer of Leshan incense and candles, and for polishing jade, with annual sales of about 10,000 dan. After the lifting of the maritime ban, tea exports were all made with white wax, which was welcomed by foreigners. As a result, sales have expanded slightly, increasing the sales market by about 3,000 dan per year. (4) True and False Identification Methods: Because white wax is expensive, there are many counterfeits in order to make a large profit. The distinction between true and false is difficult, like the difficulty of identifying gelatin and cinnabar, and it is definitely impossible for outsiders to judge. However, there is a simple method: just look down at the surface and see cloud-like flowers,</p>
<p>moist oil, dry to the touch, smooth to the touch, slightly astringent, but without stickiness; also, the color should not be deathly white or tender white, and the four sides should have gaps, or be broken in various ways. The nature is hard, not completely white, then it is undoubtedly the real thing. (End)</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Autumn Cocoons Transported to Shanghai Increasingly Flourishing</h3>
<p>(Chang'an Autumn Cocoon Market Already Ended) The opening of scales in Chang'an's nearby cocoon markets has been underway for nearly half a month, and the collected quantities are nearing their quotas. Recently, the amount of goods arriving on the market has decreased, and most cocoon markets have suspended weighing for half a month. The fresh cocoons collected have all been dried and are being transported to Shanghai in batches. In recent days, over a thousand bales of autumn dry cocoons have been transported from Chang'an Station to Shanghai daily.</p>
<p>(Chang-Xi Autumn Cocoons and Silk are Inherently Expensive) The autumn cocoon production in the Chang-Xi area is poor, and prices are high. When the new dry cocoons are transported to Shanghai for silk testing, the results show that 550 catties of dry cocoons are required to produce 100 catties of silk. The cost of cocoons alone is 650 yuan per bale, and with the addition of reeling labor, the cost of silk per bale is 770-780 yuan. Currently, the price offered by foreign firms is only 710 yuan, resulting in a loss of 50-60 yuan for each manufacturer.</p>
<p>(Sales of Rayon Continue Smoothly, Prices Stable) With the foreign exchange rate stabilized, sales of rayon to merchants continue smoothly. Yesterday, the Yanqing gang imported sixty cases of September and October futures of Shuang Liu Hai Tou No. 2, Red Fish, Flying Elephant, and other brands, priced at 181.75 to 175.25 yuan net. (Sales of Shanghai Silk Remain Difficult) The strike at the New York silk mills has not yet been resolved, and autumn sales of Lyon silk fabrics are sluggish. Existing silk inventories are substantial, and silk prices are falling daily. The prices offered by Shanghai white silk factories, relayed by telegram, are even lower, and factories are losing dozens of yuan per bale, making sales even more difficult. The market atmosphere is stagnant. Yesterday, only Hangzhou silk merchants purchased ten bales of spot white silk, and Indian firms purchased eight bales of coarse yellow silk. Prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Extraction of Superior Grade Tea Continues to be in High Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local Shanghai foreign firm tea market, Yingzhuang Jinlong Foreign Firm and Huacha Company were heavily searching for extracted superior grade silk tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas. Baocheng Yongxing and other firms were also making supplementary purchases. Overall market transactions continued to be strong. The opening offer was 200 yuan, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous day. Russian companies and Baitou firms had large appetites for Gongxi silk tea, and the market turned firm. Other items such as needle tea and eyebrow tea tended to be inactive.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Nine Years, a Blink of an Eye! - Person</h3>
<p>This morning, around seven-thirty, I left home and passed through Dongyouheng Road, turning onto Zhaofeng Road to M School to learn piano. This road was the route I took every day between five and nine years ago, but in the past five years, I have rarely had the opportunity to walk it. Today, being the first time in five years that I walked this road again, I couldn't help but feel a vast sense of emotion!</p>
<p>M School still stands there, solemn and majestic, except for the addition of a new school building, everything is progressing steadily, just like the graduation song we sang when we left school: "May our alma mater advance a thousand miles every day!" But thinking of myself, am I a laggard among humanity? Or am I improving? How much of my aspirations have been realized? How much of my ambitions have been achieved? This is truly a great question, one that even I cannot answer. Nine years ago, when I first entered M School, I still wore two small braids, carrying a handbag to school, my simple and small mind containing pure, naive fantasies. I had no sadness, no sorrow, all I felt was joy, only passion. On my delicate heartstrings, I once plucked the idea of "I want to serve society and create happiness for the people." Although women's careers were still in their infancy at that time, my idea of serving society was influenced and inspired by something, which even I didn't know. I just thought with great enthusiasm, "If I study hard now, I will eventually achieve my goals. 'Where there's a will, there's a way' - that's what it means!"</p>
<p>Nine years, a blink of an eye. Indeed, in these short but actually long nine years, countless small or significant waves have risen in the women's world! The most obvious is that the long hair that women had for a long time in history was also cut off due to the changing times. Now, every woman has short, shoulder-length hair, loose and wavy; the chest, which used to be tightly bound, has also been liberated due to the trend. Recently, women running barefoot and showing their legs on the street is considered the height of fashion. This is something I couldn't have dreamed of nine years ago! In addition, in terms of careers, women have also gained some equality and status, but unfortunately, the nickname "flower vase" has become a special title for women! Are these phenomena truly a liberation for women? Have they achieved complete equality? Have they truly embarked on the journey of society? Many people advocate that another women's movement is needed now, and I am very sympathetic to this. I don't want to receive the nickname "flower vase". Although I am still shrinking in a corner of the education field, which is generally considered a chronic illness, the childhood "fantasy of serving society and benefiting the masses," as well as the objective influence of the environment in recent years, have strengthened my confidence to create the present and grasp reality! Because "now" is the most reliable!</p>
<p>Today I have returned to my alma mater, but nine years have passed. In these short but actually long nine years, I have come to know the true face of "women" in society. I feel that now we women need to launch a broad and effective women's movement ourselves!</p>
<h3>Daughter - Jing Jia</h3>
<p>Mrs. Wang and Mrs. Xu are very close friends, living in the same neighborhood, only five or six houses apart! Mrs. Wang has a fifteen-year-old daughter who is studying in junior high school, very beautiful and lively. Mrs. Xu looks on, envying Mrs. Wang's good fortune, because she has no children.</p>
<p>The person living in the second-floor pavilion room of Mrs. Xu's house moved out, and coincidentally, the third-floor pavilion room of Mrs. Wang's house was also empty, so they both posted rental notices outside their doors.</p>
<p>Soon, two students came to Mrs. Xu's house to say they wanted to rent the room. Mrs. Xu greeted them with a smile and showed them the room.</p>
<p>"Fifteen dollars a month," Mrs. Xu said, "It's cheap. You won't find a room like this for this price."</p>
<p>The students seemed very satisfied and nodded. They said, "We'll give you a reply tonight!" They left without paying a deposit.</p>
<p>After the students left, they never came back. Mrs. Xu's room remained empty.</p>
<p>One day, Mrs. Wang invited Mrs. Xu to her house to play cards. As soon as Mrs. Xu entered the door, she caught a glimpse of a student's shadow.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang told her that the room had been rented out for eighteen dollars a month to two XX University students.</p>
<p>Mrs. Xu's eyes reddened, and she sighed softly.</p>
<p>After playing cards, she ran into one of the students who had just returned on the stairs, the one who had come to rent the room before.</p>
<p>Mrs. Xu was very suspicious. She was very surprised that the two students would spend eighteen dollars to rent Mrs. Wang's room, but were unwilling to rent my room for fifteen dollars! Aren't the rooms the same?</p>
<p>That evening, Mrs. Xu talked to her husband about this. Mr. Xu smiled and said, "What good thing can students have! They'll live wherever there's a woman! Doesn't Mrs. Wang have a daughter?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Xu was even more heartbroken! She complained that she didn't give birth to a daughter.</p>
<p>Two months passed! Mrs. Wang suddenly rushed to Mrs. Xu's house in a fit of anger. Mrs. Wang told Mrs. Xu in a very embarrassed tone that her daughter had been seduced by those two students and had stayed in a hotel for four days. She said, "I will definitely not let this go! What is this! My daughter has been ruined! Can she still be a human being? Definitely, I can't spare them! I must sue, sue!" Mrs. Wang cried! Mrs. Xu was stunned for a long time, unable to say a word. Mrs. Xu looked at her empty pavilion room and said to herself, "If that's the case, I'd rather not have a daughter and leave the room empty!"</p>
<h3>Name Registration - Kang</h3>
<p>When a child is two or three months old, the parents give him a nickname for convenience, such as: A Da, A Mao, A Jian, San Guan, Lao Si, Little Brother, Little Sister, Little Dog, Xiao Sanzi... But these are just appellations, because such appellations cannot be recorded in the classics, so when they go to school, they have to ask the old teacher to look through the Four Books and Five Classics, celebrity maxims, or celebrity dictionaries, and take a line of warning, and take a school name, which is just the beginning of the name, if you are happy, then it doesn't matter if you change to Xiao Shunzi, Zhu'er, Mary!</p>
<p>If your name is just like a mosquito buzzing (not like thunder), then nothing will happen. But if your name is as famous as Invincible Toothpaste or the Tingdali Watch Store, then if there is someone with the same name or a similar-sounding name, you will suspect that they are intentionally impersonating or alluding to you, so you will post a notice, "...All my letters will be authenticated by my seal...", but the notice is just a notice, but it cannot interfere with other people's similar names, and cannot sue in court like Invincible Toothpaste, because there is no such provision in the law! Moreover, in recent years, probably because of the large population and popular education, there are more and more people with the same name, which is really a worrying thing for celebrities! Not to mention celebrities, even contributors have to add another stamp because of this.</p>
<p>Now I have a good idea, which is to ask the government to set up a "Name Registration Office" or a "Name Registration" Bureau. Whenever a person takes a name, they must register it. If they encounter someone with the same name, they must change their name, or add an X mark below it like Tianlu or Laoda Fang. In this way, the Civil Code of the Republic of China can also add a provision "No identical names are allowed", and the court can also have more business and collect more court fees. It can also add a few more vacancies to help those unemployed managers. Especially when the treasury is as empty as a washing, this can also add a kind of name tax, which is really killing several birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Shop Assistant Correspondence</p>
<p>How to Make Amends</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have seen that your column answers difficult questions correctly and meticulously. This time I also have a question, please advise.</p>
<p>My girlfriend, so and so, is now twenty-six years old and a graduate of a physical education school. A few months ago, she had a relationship with me. Afterwards, in order to seek a permanent solution, I sought out two like-minded comrades to establish a certain primary school. The school is considered to be developing well, but the fees are low, and after the teachers have fulfilled all their obligations, each semester still loses three or four hundred yuan. The two comrades, seeing no hope, are willing to give up; at the same time, we two also often have disagreements. Now no one is responsible for the school's finances and teaching affairs. Under this situation, is it better to maintain it or shut it down? Maintaining it has the above-mentioned difficulties, can we negotiate according to the contract resolution? If we shut it down, the tuition fees have already been collected and cannot be returned, is there any violation of the law? As for our secret, recently due to disagreements, she has publicly revealed our love history to relatives and friends. In this situation, I am afraid that an accident will occur. If it does, will there be any legal implications? Now I am deeply considering the above problems and cannot think of a proper solution, so I earnestly request that the editor answer in detail in your publication. Many thanks. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Xu Yichen</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The entanglement between Mr. Xu and his girlfriend is not very serious. She is already twenty-six years old this year, not a minor girl. Unless she can provide strong evidence to prove that Mr. Xu used illegal means such as violence, coercion, fraud, poison, or hypnosis at the time, she cannot just say "I was deceived" out of thin air. After you had a relationship, in order to seek a permanent solution, you adopted a cooperative management method, which shows that the two parties did not formally marry. Therefore, the relationship between you can only be regarded as a consensual immoral act, and does not have any binding effect. Under this kind of relationship, opposing opinions can continue; once the feelings are not compatible, just walk away. As the saying goes, each goes his own way.</p>
<p>As for the school you run, according to the letter, it has now reached a point where no one is responsible for the finances and teaching affairs, and soon there will be a tendency to run out of resources, so you must think of a way to make amends. Otherwise, if someone reports it, then crimes such as "fraud", "borrowing money under the guise of education", and "misleading youth" will be added to your head one by one, and you will not be able to escape! Originally, establishing a school is a kind of service to society, not a personal enterprise. There must be sufficient preparation and a strong foundation before it can begin. Now Mr. Xu, his girlfriend, and the two comrades either regard the school as a love nest or regard the school as a source of profit. The motive for running the school is wrong, so of course there will be no good results. Fortunately, it has not been half a year before it has become exhausted, otherwise it will harm the youth without end, and the sins of Mr. Xu and others will reach the heavens. For the present plan, the only thing to do is for the people who came forward to run the school to prepare cash, notify the students' families, state the situation that it cannot be maintained, and ask them to take back the tuition fees and quickly transfer schools, so as to reduce the crime. On one side, renegotiate the contract, and on the other side, negotiate with each.</p>

<h3>The Division of Life (Short Play) Wen Bing</h3>
<p>Time: Evening, September 11, 1933. Location: Mouth of a Shanghai alley.</p>
<p>Characters: Four children: Haishan (bank clerk's son), Zida (official's son), Anian (small cobbler), Qiusheng (newsboy), all around ten years old.</p>
<p>Haishan (chewing sugar-fried chestnuts with his mouth full, eyes looking towards the horse)</p>
<p>(Looking around both ends of the road) It's this time, why haven't that bunch of coin tossers come yet? I lost a thousand to them the day before yesterday, all won by that bald-headed guy; luckily I won back eight hundred cents yesterday. There's a trick to this, you have to be calm and have good eyesight when you toss.</p>
<p>Anian Chestnuts fried with sugar smell good! (Anian, working while sitting on a small canvas stool, glanced at Haishan)</p>
<p>Haishan (extremely contemptuous) Good smell, good smell, you want to eat some, right?</p>
<p>Anian It's good enough for us to have food to eat.</p>
<p>Haishan (throwing a handful of chestnut shells from his hand at Anian's head, eyes towards Zida) Zhi, tossing coins is really fun!</p>
<p>Zida I haven't tried it yet, let's see how you toss today? Maybe I'll try it too!</p>
<p>Haishan It's really fun! You'll know once you toss it.</p>
<p>Qiusheng XX newspaper, XX night newspaper, (pauses briefly) Want an XX newspaper? (holding a newspaper towards Haishan to sell)</p>
<p>Haishan This annoying leper is here again, I'm too lazy to even look at Jade Chain these days. And you want me to read your X newspaper, get lost!</p>
<p>Qiusheng Oh, so fierce! (retreats two steps) XX newspaper, XX night, night, newspaper! (disappears into the mouth of the alley)</p>
<p>Zida Hai, when you mentioned Jade Chain, I remember, yesterday my sister wanted me to borrow Bite the Milk Record from the stall, and the old man said you had already borrowed it, have you finished reading it? Lend it to me, okay!</p>
<p>Haishan God knows, I borrowed it that day, and because I was tossing coins, I put it on this stone step (pointing to a stone step in front of him), and then it was gone. (pauses briefly) I haven't even read it yet, according to the old man, it's a really great book, if it's really lost, I'll have to pay at least two dollars, how unlucky! Zhi, are you making fun of me, did you pick it up?</p>
<p>Zida No, no! (said seriously)</p>
<p>Haishan Then the little cobbler must have stolen it, the leper didn't come to sell newspapers that day!</p>
<p>Anian Damn it, why would I steal your ghost book? I can't even take care of myself! Be careful, or I'll give you two slaps!</p>
<p>Haishan I didn't expect this poor look to be so fierce!</p>
<p>Anian I'm poor, what's it to you? Damn it, saying I stole your book!</p>
<p>Zida If you're any more fierce, I'll drag you to the police station to get sued!</p>
<p>Anian Who dares? I haven't broken the law! Damn it! (throws down his work, stands up)</p>
<p>Haishan Quick, don't bother with him, arguing with such a cheapskate will only lower our standards. (waving his hand to stop Zida from helping)</p>
<p>Zida If you didn't steal it, then you didn't steal it, but seeing how fierce he is, I'm really not convinced! (with a bit of gentlemanly tone)</p>
<p>Haishan Oh, that bald-headed guy is here, over there, coming in that car, Zhi, did you see him?</p>
<p>Zida That's him, he's really good at tossing coins!</p>
<p>Haishan His tricks are quite clever! (His face beams with excitement)</p>
<p>Zida Then I'll go back to get money right away, you toss first, anyway, I'm just here to try! (He runs back into the alley like a wisp of smoke)</p>
<p>Qiusheng XX newspaper, XX!! night, newspaper! (goes away from the alley)</p>
<p>Anian Anyone need broken shoes repaired? Anyone need broken shoes repaired? (The little cobbler carries a small wooden box of tools on his back and goes along the street looking for business again) (Curtain falls)</p>
<h3>Finding a Way Out - Shi Ben</h3>
<p>Present-day China is suffering externally from the armed aggression of "imperialism" and the threat and exploitation of economic forces, and internally from the ravages of "communist bandits" and the devastation of "wars and floods", leaving it utterly devastated and unimaginable! Under these dire and terrifying circumstances of natural and man-made disasters, the collapse of the rural economy and the decline of the social situation have been accelerated. China, once known as a "flowery world", is now reflecting a widespread and profound atmosphere of death and recession everywhere.</p>
<p>In the midst of the withering of industry, the depression of commerce, the bankruptcy of the countryside, and all the other elements presenting a disturbing and frightening trend, a widespread contraction phenomenon has been created. Regardless of shops or institutions, all are implementing "tightening policies" and are busy laying off employees and cutting salaries! In order to save their dying embers. Under this crisis of "contraction", tens of thousands of countless unemployed masses have been produced!</p>
<p>The most painful thing in life is unemployment. Material panic and spiritual depression are a hundred times more painful than "broken love." However, "it is difficult to know without experiencing it." Those who have not tasted the taste of unemployment always think that my words are excessive, but I have tasted the taste of unemployment not long ago, for three years, so I know that this "pain of unemployment" is indeed real pain. Even now, when I hear the word "unemployment", I am startled and frightened like a "startled bird"!</p>
<p>In this declining society, unemployed comrades who have been eliminated, listen: After you lose your jobs, you naturally have to hurry up and "seek a way out" in order to solve the "bread" problem. This, indeed, is the lifeline of the proletariat, and once you lose your job and this lifeline is broken, you must, of course, try every possible way to think of a remedy, otherwise, are you a fool who doesn't want to live? However, I think, in realistic society, it is indeed not easy to talk about the three words "finding a way out"! Because during my three years of unemployment, I really recognized the original face of this evil society, which is a "world of fickle fortunes" and a sinister and terrifying "mean and snobbish" one. Once you lose your job and run to beg a few "old friends and acquaintances," don't expect to see the "gentle and warm" face that he used to greet you with when you had a job. Not to say a harsh word, nine out of ten people will definitely put on a solemn face and very coldly answer you, saying what "oversupply of personnel" "difficulty in seeking employment" "implementation of tightening" difficult to serve and other nonsense, as if not dealing with you so coldly, the poverty in your body will immediately pass to him. But then again, if you and the friend you are asking for have some "nepotistic relationship" or a little "shadow effect," then it can be determined that he will never deal with you in the above way, and will definitely answer your request without hesitation! If you and the friend you are asking for have neither a "nepotistic relationship" nor a "background effect" and he will also agree to your request, then you must have two "magic weapons" on your own body, which are the effects of the "magic weapons", not the effects of friendship! What are these two magic weapons? That's "flattery" and "bragging"! Therefore, if a person loses his job and wants to seek a way out, he must first ask himself whether he has these three conditions: "nepotistic relationship", "background influence", "flattery, bragging". Having one of them will have unexpected effects, otherwise, no matter how you try to drill, seek and plead, and run until the soles of your feet are worn out, you will not get any effect!</p>
<p>These are some of the experiences I have gained from three years of unemployment!</p>
