<p>時評</p>
<p>美俄參加與禁運軍火元</p>
<p>蘇俄外交委員長李維諾夫接到國聯邀請參加顧問委員會來文後僅表示將携回提交政府。而國聯大衆。則預料其將謝絕參加。又一部分人則以蘇俄外交手段。向示人以莫測。今之參加與否。尚未可逆料也。美國答覆國聯之牒文雖聲明甚表贊同。然文内並未提及參加與否。故國聯中人以美國缺乏熱誠。表示不甚滿意。而又一部分人。則以美政府更迭在即新總統登台後必有更切實之宣示也。</p>
<p>國聯在此騎虎難下之勢。固甚急切盼望美俄之參加。以增加其應付日本之力量。然即使美俄果眞參加。國聯能增加幾許力量耶。國聯力量之最大者厥爲實行制裁日本之權。然觀歐洲各大國之意見紛歧。利害互異俄美姑勿問。即國聯中主持正義之各國。恐亦絕無一國有毅然實施之勇氣舍經濟制裁一事而。外尚有何法足以增加國聯之力量耶或曰禁止軍火輸入遠東誠亦爲銷滅中日戰爭之一大力量。軍火但禁運日。而不禁運華。更足以見制裁日本之力量。然而專輸中國。又慮中途爲日本所劫。且一部分輿論亦尚多表示反對。則此問題之是否能成事實。亦未可料。故國聯之所謂力量。究有幾何吾人實未敢輕量之也。</p>
<p>日本能審。知國聯之力量。故日代表敢毅然離去日内瓦而不顧亦惟能審知國聯之力量。故亦不必急急於正式退出國。聯蓋以代表之離去日内瓦表示其藐視國聯絕不服從之意。以不即正式退出國聯。表示暫留國聯以轉圜之機會。國聯不再以實力加重壓迫者。則將來尚有好相見之日日本知國聯深。故一方面儘竭其全力以攻熱河。一方面對國聯。儘可若即若離從容以待國際形勢之轉變。此後美俄參加而竟不能實現。禁止軍火運日之議而亦竟如泡影。則日本更有何懼。</p>
<p>由是可見國聯顧問委員會縱使成立。而此後國際間之變化尚多其所變化。爲有利於我乎。抑有利於日乎。有利於我。至多完成國聯道德上制裁之工作。有利於日。則國際間之熱力潛銷世界清明一現之氣象。復爲惡雲所籠罩不知更陷中國於何等狀况。我國民在此危機四伏之中。非拚死命以自救安有第二生路。</p>

<p>東北義勇軍後援會、昨日下午四時、在中社開第五次理事會、并歡迎秉三氏、到熊希齡·褚輔成·許世英·馮少山·殷鑄夫·嚴直方·吳山·穆藕初·殷芝齡·等二十餘人、由褚輔成主席、席間熊氏報告東三省義勇軍情形、及最近熱邊急需救濟物品、並通過請蔣委員長北上督師電文等數案、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>首由主席褚輔成致歡迎詞、</p>
<p>略謂、九一八事變以後、東北負責將領張學良、素抱不抵抗主義、而熱河主席湯玉麟、亦態度不明、至今日均能明白表示抗日、均賴態秉三先生一年餘在北方努力之成績、而去年四月間、熊先生親赴熱河、湯氏始轉變態度、而義軍亦始能在熱邊得相當之援助接濟、與關内發生聯係、其功尤鉅、今熊先生南下、與滬具人士接洽、援助華北抗日作戰將士、同人除表示欽仰歡迎之忱、並乞指示吾人以努力之方云、</p>
<p>熊氏報告</p>
<p>熊希齡氏即起立發言、謂我國今日在國聯中較能獲得外交之勝利、與道德之勝利均係義勇軍作戰之力、日人曾對於國際宣稱、五個月後、即能肅清東三省内部之擾亂、事實上乃一年半後、尚未能安定、使國際觀聽、曉然知［滿洲國］之爲民衆所堅决反對、其　　、而義軍之所以能支持歲月、均後援會源源接濟之力、次分述遼南及吉黑等省之義勇軍情形、謂蘇馬李王等部、雖敗退俄境、然民間義軍、尚有二十餘萬、與人民有密切之合作、决非日人所能消滅、至熱邊華北情形、則吾力甚厚、士氣甚旺、士兵曾對慰勞者言、吾儕無他要求、有之、惟作戰令耳、現在熱邊所急需物質之接濟、爲築路·糧食·子</p>
<h3 id="c73">熊希齡氏在中社報告情形（徐天章攝） <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>彈·汽車·四項、而精神上之鼓勵、與軍事人材之供給補充、均甚重要、歐戰後、法名將福煦有言、謂法國之能戰勝、首須歸功於道路之興築、次爲工廠工人之努力供給用具、次爲婦女之能代替男子作功、最後始爲士兵之戮力、此語深可作借鏡也、我國能一致奮勇抵禦、則最多爲歐戰時之比利時、蒙重大之損失破壞、决不至於亡國也、</p>
<p>許氏報告</p>
<p>熊氏報告畢、許世英起立報告、救濟東北難民會施賑情形、希望在極短時期内、作一維持熱河民食之整個計劃、旋即討論議案、通過、（一）電請軍事委員會蔣委員長、尅日北上督師、以統一指揮、振作士氣、（二）公推熊希齡·褚輔成·二代表晋謁軍政部長何應欽、促定華北軍事規劃、（三）電關内前綫各將領出關殺敵、以分攻熱敵勢、（四）派吳山·陳培德·馮少山·殷芝齡·胡鳳翔·沈祖儒·六人人、分向本市各團體接洽、聯電促張學良堅决抗戰、及其他會務各案而散、</p>
<p>請蔣督師</p>
<p>南昌蔣委員長鈞鑒、日宼舉其傾國兵力以國佔我熱河、我國咸怵於此役、爲全國存亡所　、各路師旅、忠勇奮發、齊集赴援、而東北忠義之士、崛起草野、組織義勇軍殺敵、士氣已大可恃、惟迭據近日報告、朝陽等第一綫已有危險、聞其原因、苦於軍令不能統一、非有我公親自北上督師、統馭指揮、不足以壯前方之士氣、挽回危亡之大勢、且以瀋垣變作以還、政府以整個計劃之故未嘗派遣一師、草野愚民、頗形觖望、近自宋代院長赴熱視察、華北軍心民氣、爲之一振、我公握軍事總樞、爲國民仰望、如蒙仗鉞親征、士氣當必愈加感奮、不僅慰北地雲霓之望、且益壯全國敵愾之心、至跳梁贛匪、近漸弭平、即有伏莽殘孽、偏師剿捕、亦足濟事、已可無煩大舉之防勦、方今大患、無　於日宼、伏望權衡輕重、迴戈北指、以摧殘敵、而復失地、中國興亡、繫公一身、唯詳察焉、東北義勇軍後援會、叩、感</p>

<p>春秋航空救國漫話  寄萍　　航空救國的呼聲很高，而實際的成效，還是徴弱。報上所見，除正太戲路員工集欵十萬元、適足飛機一架之價外，其他尚未聞大宗恫欵。在這時勢萬分危急的當兒·空軍有立刻補充的必要！而預算經費，决非一二百萬元所能舉事。所以我們目前最急切的問題，是如何籌這筆鉅大的基金？　　在古時尚有所謂［毁家紓難］的義舉，到如今，能有幾個像這樣的志士仁人？除海外僑胞尚能盡力捐輸外，在國内，我未聞有過慷慨的人，𤯝樂助十萬以上者！難道國内就没有家財萬貫的［達富富豪］麽？我恐不然，［達官］［富豪］到不在少數，尤其現在的官無不富，只可惜到國勢危急動當捐助的時候，就富而不［豪］，官而不［官而不［達］了！］　　我説像羣作友那樣三千萬不兑現的口頭救國捐，固然不歡迎，而［達］官］［富豪］吝嗇的態度，也似乎於心不忍吧？至於一般平日爲衣食奔走的同胞，雖然很熱心的納捐，但爲數有限，不過表明愛國的熱忱而已。　　如此説來，這筆航空救國基金，就終於不能如數募足麽？我説不然。只要有設計，有方法；有執行的人！有持久的力；就可以實現我們的計劃。新近中國航空協會定了一個徴求會員的辦法，以募集基金，這意思雖好，但難於普遍，不易集成鉅數，所謂事倍而功半，仔細考慮，尚不能認爲妥善。　　天虚我生近著［航空救國之我見］一文，（見昨日本刊）我連讀了兩遍，深爲歉脹！他的設計，是由城市以至鄉村，由一隅而推行全國；如此做法，則二萬萬的航空救國基金，一年之内，必可足數。而喚起民衆，普告全國，猶其餘事。希望航空協會諸同志們，根據此旨，縝密研究，先擬具體方案，逐步實施，譬如行車，政府推之，人民挽之，如其不行，我不之信！　　只唱航空救國，而不急急於自造飛機及訓練航空人材，也不是澈底解决的辦法，假如我們募得了基金，採購二百架飛機，預算需欵二千萬元，這漏巵眞不算小，如其我國能自製，何苦把金錢拱手毒人呢？又如國内航空人材缺乏，卽使備了大批飛機，一時也有［材難］之歎！所以航空救國的根本問題，是在自造飛機與積極訓練空軍人材。但以目前的形勢而論，籌募基金，還當及早進行，决不能因此而稍延緩，這也是國人所公認的了。死話  百合　　謀生不易靠着列祖列宗積德，徼倖而没投入四足着地的畜生道，居然具備着圓顱方趾的條件，形成了一個會吃飯的二足動物，［幸何如之］？　　可是在這二十世紀，物質文明的世界裏，雖然做了一個人，要維持這個［人］的生命，也不是簡單而容易的一回事。　　吃飯，魚骨鯁了喉，準會爛喉而死。就不是魚骨鯁，一口飯咽下去，也會噎死，嗆死。逃過這幾關，也會害不消化病而死。就是怕死而不吃飯，餓了肚子也會死。消化器官要殺人，呼吸器官，也可致人於死。怎見得？哪，空氣裏滿佈着肺癆，腥紅熱，腦膜炎等上千千，上萬萬細菌，每一個細菌，就足殺害一條性命而有餘。此外如蒼蠅傳染霍亂，蚊蟲傳染瘧疾，一切飛來横禍，防不勝防。沾染了疾病，寳貝性命，延醫診治，包送終一服藥，馬上回老家。　　這些且丢開不算坐在家裏，房子會倒下來壓死。走在路上，會給汽車輾死。坐在船上，船會觸礁沉没。搭上火車，火車會得相撞。坐飛機，飛機會得觸山頭。富翁坐了汽車，要給綁匪撕票。窮人拐着腿走，會有流彈光降。當了大總統，要有人暗殺。做了强盜，剌客，要被殺頭。發生了戰事，逃得慢，槍子無情，跑得快，炸彈會在頭頂上掉下來。尋花問柳，牡丹花下死。竹林之遊，爲了嵌二餅給人攔和，一氣而亡。　　上所述的，不過略述一二。這個世界上，隨處是死路一條。做一個人，一天到晚避死，避過九九人入十一死，可算是第一號福人。可是不死於九九八十一死的人，却偏要自殺求死。死有甚麽趣味。眞是匪夷所思。都市散記  郭蘭韾　　忘懷了一切　昨夜我在薄醉後開始踏上了北四川路，最先觸眼的是幾個藏青呢制服的日兵很例慢神氣的在巡邏，在他們的眼光中露出虎視耽耽，好像整備着隨時屠殺人的兇暴。看見了頓使我憤怒燃燒了心，但有什麽用呢？在這條火龍般街證下的北四川路，已經遺忘了去年的烽烟，殺戮，轟炸，哀泣，怒號，熱血，悲憤，逐漸恢復它的神秘，享樂，歡笑，麻醉的生活了。啊年紅證，汽車，烟，酒，女人。舞塲，咖啡店中間，不知埋葬了多少没有靈魂的男女？表現着不知亡國恨的把戲。　　我在靶子路十字街頭的轉角上竚立着，電車汽車，人力車交錯着流動，人物也不住的來往，誰説熱河的告急，已驚動了都市中迷夢依戀的人們？除去了賣晚報的人在高喊日帝國主義三路進攻熱河的消息之外，什麽也看不出，什麽也聽不見。看見的是享樂的男女，聽見的是舞塲的音樂。　　在十字街頭立了一刻，我也就在悲憤的情絡中向南走了。到海寗路，看見了新中央與融光大戲院散出了一羣人們，我想起了電影救國的把戲，想來這般熱心的人們是在實行電影救國了吧！我漫無目標的一路巡禮着歸來。笑的分柝  陳子英　　　　各有其妙　　在愛多亞路的一角廣塲上，給許多人圍成一個大圈，人圈的當中，擺着一條板凳，凳上仰臥着一個中年婦人，雙脚朝天豎起；一個年青的姑娘，穿着一件很引人注目的紅色小衣，盤膝坐着那個掃人的脚上；旁邊一個男子，執着一枝花槍，指着四面的觀衆，大聲呌着：［擲，擲，大家來擲，愈重愈好］！］於是四面的觀衆，都發狂似的從袋裏抓出一把一把的銅子，向着那個姑娘的面部，頭部，身部狠命的擲去，那個姑娘用一條手帕遮着自已的面部，開始唱着一種引誘的歌曲，歌聲愈清鋭，擲的人愈起勁，擲中了，大家都笑了；那個男子望着那些銅子一把一把的滾下來，於是也笑了；那個姑娘見他們都在笑，便也展開手帕笑了，伊一笑，銅子又像雨點般飛來了，　　擲！擲！大家都來擲·愈重愈好·　　笑！笑！大家都在笑，愈笑愈妙·蜜蜂的剌  醉竹　　實業救國，敎育救國，藝術救國，跳舞　救國，戀愛救國，娛樂救國，再下去還有：吃飯救國，睡覺救國，素食救國，洋装救國。漪歟盛哉！救國者委實太多哩。每年大正月裏的流星，花砲，烟火，多麽好頑。　　日本人到底是我們同種同文的好朋友，所以這兩年也趕在正月裏大凑其趣。　　流星，（飛機炸彈）花砲，（大砲彈）烟火，（烟幕彈）在我們家裏，放一個不亦樂呼！　　不過：［買了砲仗别人放］，却是誰的作俑？小説田莊主  秦瘦鷗　大家小心準備弓箭！］他們的叔父，！！後備兵的總指揮老五，已瞧見隔河人影晃動，烟塵大起，知道前綫是失敗了；忙呌小禾們四五十個人，一齊準備弓箭，好射退倭子的追兵。他自已却當先奔出林去，跳在小河裏，擎着一柄大斧候着準備在田莊主們退回來之後，立即把河上那一條木橋拆毁。　　［殺啊！殺啊！］倭子抱着復仇的决心，傾國而來，這一隊足足有一千名；田莊主們雖然驍勇，可是寡不敵衆，終於支持不下而後退了。但是老人的勇氣，並没有分毫的減折，大刀在暮色蒼茫裏發狂，似的揮舞着，倭子的腦袋，像毯一般的在馬蹄下滾着；一般地死命的在苦鬥着且戰且走，到橋邊已剩寥寥地七個人。六個人已打橋上退進林子中來了，斷後的是田莊主自已。　　他一手舞着大刀，一手揮着短劍，像一座山一般的兀立在河邊，抵擋着六七百個越殺越勇的倭子；他準備在退進莊來之前，奮力把倭子們殺退幾丈路，好讓老五有充分的時間，拆毁那座木橋　　但是老人的計劃失敗了。他竭力衝殺了幾次，不但不能把倭子們殺退，反把自已陷入重圍中去了；汗水打白髮上流下來，浸透了全身的衣服。那馬也因跳躍過猛，混身流汗，像才打河裏跳起來的一樣了。　　有一部分的倭子想凑此衝過河來，幸而林子裏有埋伏着的弓箭手，一陣便把他們射退了。雖然如此，田莊主總是不能回來。　　［小禾！我們去救祖父如何？］小鈴的心很劇烈地跳着。　　［你有膽嗎？］在練武的時候，小鈴總是成績最壞的一個；因此，小禾有些懷疑他。　　接着，兩個小孩子便同時發出了一聲狂吼挺着槍，從橋上直撞過去；槍起處，接連搠死了十來個倭子。這一支生力軍，便打重圍裏救出了田莊主來。（六）游於藝富人對於金錢的觀念  蕙風　　富人對於金錢，有兩種觀念：一種是預備自已享樂；一種是留傳給他的子女。如果有人要他拿出錢來辦點公益事情，那可比［與虎謀皮］還難！　　中國人就壞在這［只知有家，］不知有國。］的上頭，一個富人，不管他的子女是白痴或是浪子，家産却不可不傳給他，要是没有子女，那末必須設法弄一個繼承的人，否則變爲［若敖之］鬼，］絕了血食，那可了不得。　　富人們往了依仗着金錢的勢力，製造許多罪惡，因此生出許多煩惱；轾於把遺産傳給子女，也適足以助長子女的依賴心，不求上進，還有因爭奪遺産，發生家庭禍變的，更是社會上極普遍的事實。所以富人把遺産傳給子女，可説［非徒無益，而又害之！］　　可是富人們决不會想到這些，現在什麽，援助義勇軍，］什麽一救濟東北無民，］什麽［航空救國，……］在富人們看來，都是些不入耳之談，因爲他們鉅大的財産，自享用不盡，必須傳給子女，現在日本兵還没有打上他們府上的大門，他們儘可什麽都不管。　　天一公司新出的一部有聲片，名呌［孽海雙］鴛，］它所描寫的，是一個當翁的女兒，爲了遺産問題，受盡種種痛苦，幾乎斷送性命，後來經過許多周折，幸得父女重聚，那時富翁覺悟金錢對於子女，實在實多利少，如果把金錢來創辦社會公益事情，替羣衆謀福利，豈不很有意義，於是提出大部份財産，來舉辦公益和敎育事業。　　我想富人們看了這部［孽海雙鴛］如果腦筋不麻木，至少對於金錢的觀念（變更一些）舞臺之背景  李寓一　　　　舞台之背景。在歐西與日本早已蟺脱於寫實方法。而形成象徴主義矣。蓋以寫實如眞者。習之旣久。了無意味。眞景固不必於舞台。大地之中。皆眞景也矧所謂寫實如眞者。不過利用照相方法與透視之理。引觀者注意於一主點。而幻其形如眞耳。　兩軍相接迤　數百里。在舞台方丈之地不能表現者。背景亦失其效力。使曲折數面之山水。表於一面之畫布上。放不論我國之畫背景者租俗錯亂。不堪卒視。卽西洋之寫實如生。不差累黎者。亦莫可展其技巧。其理之窮而技之盡。勢不得捨固有之寫實。而轉於象微之方法。佈置森林之背景。象徴以三兩樹株。描摹山水。僅作大石數方。流水一曲耳。使觀者不欲全其形。但能明其意耳。其簡也。悲劇之背景用青灰暗綠藍黄月白等色之布。喜劇之背景則以紅綠黄紥興奮精神之色調。以白色爲雪之象徴。以暗綠爲雨之表現。青色象春。綠色象夏。金黄以象秋。象牙乳白諸色以象冬。其寫屋不作瓦與糯。但略示其輪廓。其寫樹也。不必幹與枝。菊葉叢生。要略點綴以綠色示葉。赭色示幹耳。其寫水也。純一之碧色耳。其寫天空也，絕一之青色耳。尚有引人注意得有無窮之趣味者。則爲背景圖案。不寫形。不作色。而以各種新美圖案。猶之以布爲後幕。使觀者得專注意於演劇之本身。而不旁落於背景。此圖案後幕者。不過爲劇之襯托耳。凡此種種。統稱之爲表現派舞台背景。與我國之象徴藝術頗相近。鏵　國之國盛。陳意之之高。表現之充分。已爲世界所公認。在舞台之背景上。正宜應用國盛之壁盡方法。表現巨大線條之趣味。引起高尚純潔之感。較諸表現派之西盡背景。更覺有味。今日之上海舞台。苟能應用此種方法。爲背景上開一生面。必能呌座也。</p>

<p>自由談對於戰爭的祈禱  何家幹　　　　讀書心得　　熱河的戰爭開始了。　　三月一日！上海戰爭的結束的［紀念日］，也快到了。［民族英雄］的肖像一次又一次的印刷着，出賣着；而小兵們的血，傷痕，熱烈的心，還要被人遭踏多少時候？回憶裏的砲聲和幾千里外的砲聲，都使得我們帶着無可如何的苦笑，去翻開一本無聊的，但是，倒也很有幾句［警句］的閒書。這警句是：　　［喂，排長，我們到底上那裏去喲？！其中的一個問。］　　［走吧。我也不曉得］。　　［丢那媽，死光就算了，走什麽］！　　［不要吵，服從命令］！［丢那媽的命令］！　　然而丢那媽歸丢媽，命令還是命令，走，四點鐘的時候，中山路復歸於沈寂，風和月兒沙沙的嚮，月亮躱在青灰色的雲海裏，睡着，依舊不管人類的事。　　這樣，十九路軍就向西退去。］（見黄震遐著·［大上海的毁滅］。）什麽時候［丢那媽］［和］［命令］不是這樣各歸各，那就得救了。不然呢？還有［警句］可以回答這個問題：　　［十九路軍打，是告訴我們説，除掉空説以外，還有些事好做！］十九路軍勝利，祗能增加我們苟且，偷安與驕傲的迷夢！十九路軍死，是警告我們活得可憐，無趣！十九路軍失敗，才告訴我們非努力還是做奴隸的好！［見同盡］。　　這是警告我們，非乂乂，則一切戰爭命裏註定的必然要失敗。現在，主戰是人人都會的了！這是一二八的十九路軍的經騐：打是一定要打的，然而切不可打勝，而打死也不好，不多不少剛剛適宜的辦法是失敗。［民族英雄］對於戰爭的祈禱是這樣的。而戰爭又的確是他們在指揮着，這指揮權是不肯讓給别人的。戰爭，禁得起主持的人預定着打敗仗的計畫嗎？好像戲臺上的花臉和白臉打仗，誰輸誰贏是早就在後臺約定了的。嗚呼，我們的［民族英雄］！春  馬國亮　　　推開窗子，温暖的陽光瀉滿了全個樓面，軟風掠過髮邊，像是帶來了春的消息。春來了？　　是的，我的朋友告訴我，馬路上的［春季大］减價］告訴我，行人們輕鬆的笑語告訴我，陽光告訴我，枝頭的新綠告訴我，女人們的春季新装告訴我，　　春來？我依舊懷疑。　　如果春天之來，僅是爲了使人們當爲口頭上應酬的資料，僅是爲使商店的老闆有所籍口來揭出［春季大减價］的布招，僅是爲使陽光温暖一點，僅是爲使枝頭長幾塊嫩葉，和僅是爲使女人們去乘機誇炫她們的新装，……那末我不能不對於春光是可愛的］的話懷疑。　　誠然，春，自有他的歡迎者在：那些賞雪賞得倦了，又想看看新嫩的綠條的；那些躺在火爐邊躺得悶了，要到郊外作春季旅行的；那些穿舊了狐裘，要試試輕羅的；那些要乘興拉幾個朋友吃吃春宴的……這，那是春之歌頌者。好像春，而目唯有春，才是他們的快樂的天使。　　然而在那邊！！大君的流離病苦的折大衆。春來了，雖然可以减少了幾個凍僵的（説不定這倒是他們所期望的解脱），但是，春，究竟題抽象的，虚渺的東西，牠不能帶給他們睡息的房子，或是，變爲食糧去分散給那些飢餓的人們。　是的，有人會説，春曾吹長了樹木，春曾吹熟了五榖；但是那實受其事的可不都是已經吃飽了住在舒服的房子裏的人們嗎！　　在全世界大多數人類所需要的當中，春曾帶給他們甚麽？　在需要上，春似乎僅是一個季候上的名　；在事實上，春不過是少數人的私有品。　　僅僅是使氣候温暖一點的春，决不是人間的大多數所需　的。　　眞正需要的，是心裏的感到的春和，而不是皮膚所感到的春和。　　倘若人人都能感到心裏的春和，那怕是在隆冬的西伯利亞！　　在大家不曾有欣賞春的美麗，春的明媚的機會與心情之前，春有什麽値得歌頌的？　　然而眞正人間需人的春，什麽時候才會臨到呢？　　朗斐露曾説過：［如果春天之來，不是每年］一次而是每世紀一次，或不是悄悄地降臨而是像地震一般地爆發出來，那麽一切的人們將要懷着怎樣好奇與熱望的心來看着這神奇的轉變呢；］　朗斐露拿這話來説季候的春，他自已也知道這不過是聊以説説的幻想而已。其實以此來説人間最需要的春的來臨，則决不是幻想。這春］的降臨，不會是悄悄地，而是像地震一般地爆發出來，是無疑的。人們都在懷着熱望的心來看着這偉大的神奇的轉變，也是眞的。　　不過人們所期望着的這個心裏的永久之春，牠不是每年或每世紀來一次；牠從不曾來過，但當牠終於有一日來了之後，牠不會像我們日常所説的［九十春光］的一般消逝的牠將永遠，永遠駐在人間，駐在每一個人的心裏。没落  許傑　　前幾天，我們時常呼着，没落］，［没落］！事實上，也不過呌喊而已，我們　並不覺得這問題是怎樣嚴重的。倒正相反，好像還有點幽默。　　我們呌着没落，老實説，充其量，也不過表示我們是智識階級，我們是有先見之明的。同時，我們也不過表示着自已的思想並不怎樣落後，我們無論如何也比那些在白天做夢，提倡把北平改成文化城的敎授們前進一些的。但是，這呌喊有什麽用呢？　　想起來，這樣的呌喊，實在是一件滑稽的事。骨子裏，還不是爲了生活，爲了每月的薪水？！只是，這幾個月，學校的薪水有些發不出了，所以是恐慌起來的。　　講到没落，自然是指着中國的經濟的破産，以及不可免的必然的轉變。經濟的破産，國事的没有辦法，事實已經放，我們的前面。因此，中國的必然的轉變，也是不用我們着急的事情，！他也有事實放在那裏，是不用我們否認的。！不過，這却只是一個遲早的問題。　　當然的囉，中國如果轉變了，我們這一種傢伙是用不着的。！你們能做些什麽事！呢，你們這種只有一個空虚的頭腦出賣着的智識階級，你們這一批曾經販入一人批的封建思想與拜金思想而又在盡量的把這些思想向學生作販賣的智識的販賣者，你們這一批旣不會開機器，又不會挑人糞的人好老，……等到時代轉變了之後，看你還會做些什麽？　　於是乎，有些人主張造保護色，有些人提倡背毯子。於是乎，大家都覺得没落是不可免的，人家都喊起很幽默的［没落𡀩］！［没落𡀩］來了。　　講到保護色，自然也是士大夫階級的傳統心理，他一面要表示他的精明的遠見，一面又要講一講明哲保身。正確些説，他是把兩隻脚放在現實的社會裏，却伸出頭來内前面的新興社會送秋波。革命雖然没有勇氣參加，但同路人，尾巴主義，總想做的。能够這樣子，他們想，就是時代轉變了，殺身之禍總可以免掉的；同時，他也不會在革命中餓死吧！　　至於背毯子呢，自然更爲幽；默；説是等中國社會轉變之後，我們這一些人，只有和上海的白俄一樣，背幾條毯子買買，以維持生活。　　　最後，我們還曾討論到這樣一個問題，那便是在這轉變的時代中，我們這一没落的階級的出路的問題。這裏有兩條路，一條是向前，一條是退後。向前的是求生，是加入下層，是加速的推進這社會的轉變，縮短這轉變期間的浪廢的歷程。退後的是等死，是個人享樂，以終天年，是等待時代的洪潮捲到，將自已淹没，以完成没落階級的歷史的任務。但是，事實告訴我們：我們是旣不能向前又不肯退後的傢伙；因爲，退後，於自已覺得不安，我們還有士大夫的臭脾氣在那裏作絞；而向前呢，又有些可怕：於是乎，我們躊躇了。　　大家覺得，我們是始終没有辦法的。無可奈何，再喊幾聲［没落啦］！［没𡀩］！罷！　　但是，這些心情，已經是前一响的事情了。　　這兩天來，我們是眞的動摇起來了。我們覺得，我們簡直没有辦法，難道這就没落了吧！想起來還有些不相信的樣子，但是，我們好像已經没有辦法了。　　原來，這幾天報上的消息一天壞一天，熱河固已靠不住，平津也有不穩的樣子。我雖然不是一個悲觀論者，但到了這個時候，我却覺得没有辦法了。　　我是永没有這樣動摇過的。無論是北伐，清黨，甚至於九一八，與一二八。但是，這一次，我却覺得事情嚴重起來了。無論中國的當局，是主張澈底的不抵抗，！不抵抗到底，或是主張長期的抵抗，事實上，中國是没有辦法了。一個混亂的局面，擺在我們的前面；我們這一批靠着嘴吧騙飯吃的敎書匠，恐怕要就此没落了吧！　　但是，等到這一種動摇的心情過了以後，我的信念到是堅决起來。横直是要没落的，那便不如快些没落吧！歷史的巨潮已經捲到了，正如旣然踏入了污泥之後的人們，再不怕污泥污到他的心上，是定要把那一朶荷花折在手裏再説的。　没落是不可免的，讓他没落吧，快些没落吧！要等到時代的巨潮的污水濺滿了，甚至浸透了你的外套的時候，你才會脱下你的紳士的禮服來，你才會在時代的巨流中赤裸裸的受洗！］我忽然這樣想着，我又堅决了起來。黑女求神記（十三）  蕭伯訥作　宜閑譯［當心呵：這要壓斷你這老年的背脊的，］她大聲説，一面跑去帮助他。［不會的，他喜洋洋地回答。］［我是上面建造着禮拜堂的石頭·］［你不是石頭；這於你太重了罷？］她説，時刻料想到他要給牠的重量壓成泥醬。［不要怕］，他愉快地對她獰笑着説。［這全是紐做的。］於是他從她的身邊跳舞過去，使那敎堂裏所有的鐘都呵噹響了。　他還未走遠到看不見，又有幾個人，穿着全鄪很仔細地洗刷過的各式黑日的服装，背着較小的，多半是更難看的紙禮拜當，一路走來。他們都向她呌道，［不要相信那個漁夫呵。不］要總那些别人的話呵。我的禮拜堂是眞的。終於她不得不轉了個彎，走進森林裏，以避他們了。爲什麽呢？因爲他們拿了石子，彼此抛擲起來；而他們幾乎像是瞎子似的瞄不準目標，那些石子便都飛在路上了。因此她斷定着，在他們中間，她是找不到她所合意的神的。　　他們走過以後，或者也可以説戰爭平順地過去以後，她回到那條路上，便見到一個很老的飄泊着的猶太人，他對她説道，［他到了麽？］　［誰到了呢？］黑女孩子説。　［就是應許着到這里來的那一個，］那猶太人説。［就是敎我守候到他來的那一個。我守候］得冒出火來了。如果再過一會兒，他還没有來，那是太遲了。因爲人們不學别的，只學在殘殺的數目上，日求其多的，互相殘殺的法子。］　［這是誰來也没有去之使他停止的。］黑女孩子説。　　［可是他會］光榮地到來的，來的時候坐在神的右手，］那猶太人説。［他這麽説啦。他會將一切事情整頓好。］　　［如果你等］候别人來將一切事情整頓好呢，］黑女孩子説。［那你］要永遠等候下去了。］於是那猶太人發出了一聲絕望的悲號；向她吐了一口唾沫，便蹣跚着去了。</p>

<p>談言好色説  吾　　色，已爲道學先生所不敢正面而視，色而且好，當然更是醜不可言，於此可知，好色二字，確不宜於破口道出。　　但是，［食色性也］，已出於聖人之口而成爲天經地義，而且梁惠王亦十分忠實的説：［寡人有疾，寡人好色］，這樣看來，好色者，並不是如何了不起的壞事，何况太王亦有斯疾，於是，名正言順，娌姘頭，吊膀子，堂而皇之，大家都學着説：［寡人有疾，寡人好色。］　　現在世界日益昌明，文明愈臻進步，於是好色一道，也隨之而達化境，翻開報紙，儘可以找着許多例證，阿大誘姦了阿二的老婆，張三淫污了李四的家小，免不了，這些被誘姦與淫污的女人，都是嬌小多姿，都是天生麗質，而阿大張三當然是好色無疑了。　　正因爲大家好色的原故，所以姑娘們的包車上，便得周圍装着電燈以襯托其色相，而四馬路的雨雪披糜，也就不能不有賣色的她們在忍飢受凍，雖然這都是資本主義社會所特有商品，但是這當然與好色有關。　　正因大家好色的原故，所以交際花之類，便出入於王孫公子之間，大學校必須要有校花選舉，宴會或茶舞塲中，必須要有名媛招待，名士蒞境，必須要麗姝獻花，辦公室中，亦必須［花瓶］點綴，舞台坤角，必須色藝雙佳，電影明星，必須色艶驚人，而且提倡國貨，必須淑女表演時装，游藝救國，必須舞后競賽伴舞。　　因爲大家都同時好色，而且好色的本領又汀上下，於是免不了大家吃醋，大家爭風，千金買笑，固然在所不惜，即因奪美而殺人，亦是義不容辭。此無他，因爲爲色而犧牲奮鬥，此之愛護祖國，還來得更有意義。　　因爲好色之不易饜足的原故，於是從前的皇帝，便有三十六宮，和七十二院，最近因被剌而受國府治喪費的某將軍，亦有妻妾十餘人，這種好色的程度，當然很難於與我輩好色者同日而語，理由是他們必須大大的好色，而且可以大大的好色。　　然而好色也不是完全没有壞處的，固然有各種各樣的六百零六或九百十四在等着人們包治痊愈或一盒斷根，大而言之，石雄之好色而被抄家，漢皇之好色而哭泣馬嵬，也都是歷史之明證。即就現在而言，有多少少年英俊的英雄們，爲了英雄美人之配合，而掩耳不聽關外的人喊馬嘶。竟有在一樓一抱之中而斷送河山數千里者。　　然則，好色之道，其如是乎？曰：如此而已！文藝石州慢  陳家慶希明硯姊畢業上庠復作東遊眷懷祖國觸緒興悲　　旣返舊京來書道念拈此寄之海上行歌，蓬島賦詩，搴裳高舉，羡他破浪乘風，不負頻年覊旅，山川信美，只恐異國飄零，仲宣鬱鬱終懷土，袖底有乾坤，又飄然歸去，延佇，燕雲萬里，目斷錦鱗，渺渺雲樹，多少閑情，欲説又還無語，風雲大陸，夢裏起舞聞鷄，撫時多亦愁如許，何日便同游，訴滿懷離緒，（却酬）常識酒是否有害？  美善　　酒中所含，除酒精外，别無主要之物；其凶順，亦視所含酒精量之多少而定，故酒類之有害與否，可謂即酒精於生理之狀態如何。現代生理學家，對於酒精之有害與否，各有其學説，或云微量有益，或謂有害，莫衷一是。但據某生命保險公司統計之報告，謂飲酒者之壽命，恒較不飲酒者爲短。　　（一）微量有益説　　酒之微量有益説，我人聞之久矣。然不能確定其實在如何。我國昔時有一唯酒無量不及亂］之説。而外人亦有諺曰：［一杯，人飲酒：二杯，酒飲酒：］三杯酒飲人］。按此説之緣起，因在人體血液中，發現有微量之酒精Ｃ２Ｈ５ＯＨ，因之乃謂糖類之入人體，先變爲酒精，然後再經燃燒作用，始供給［能］。此説雖具少許之理由，但腸中之澱粉，葡萄糖等，爲細菌發酵，亦能生酒精，若爲血吸入，血中自然有酒精之存在，此説實難能成立。　　復有人謂，酒精與在體内，經燃燒而發生［能］之糖，同爲熱源；故飲酒者，輒不喜食糖，因之亦可謂酒爲營養品之一。但是所謂營養品者，須於人體有確實之益，絕無弊害。今酒能使人得癮，實不能視爲營養物。　　（二）酒於人身之生理作用　　酒之有害否，旣不能斷定，然視下列經實騐而得之生理作用，至少有些影像。我人身體，分爲若干部，因就酒精於各系統之作用，分别述後；　　（甲）　消化系胃之作用，爲分泌消化液，消化蛋白質。飲酒以後，胃之血管擴張，黏膜充血，分泌線過分疲勞：且胃液主要成分之胃液素，遇酒精起沉澱作用，並能減少胃液之殺菌力，而易感受傳染病。加以酒精能使蛋白質沉澱，則難於消化。　　（乙）神經系飲酒者之神經細胞體，及織維中之原形質，毁壞甚多，結締組織皆堆積於細胞，以代原形質，細胞便不能行使其職權，故酒醉之徒，其神經失其主宰，且因此發生半身不遂，中風，發狂等病症。　　（丙）呼吸系酒精能麻醉運動胸部，及管理伸縮之神經，减其運動之力量，及减肺臟器管之黏膜充血，多分泌痰液，又使肺胞Ａir　suc之容量减少，故飲酒者易染肺炎，及其他肺病。　　（丁）循環系酒可奪血中之水分，影響於血壓，縮小赤血球，减其運輸養氣之能力；擴張皮膚表面之毛細管，蒸發水分，及散失多量之熱。故飲酒後，體温反降低。　（戍）股肉系　飲酒則股肉變爲脂肪，心臟，血管等處之肌肉亦然。故喜飲酒者，其腹部常大逾常人。且肌肉中之神經，往往不能任主宰之指揮，故運動選手，不准其飲酒。　　（已）骨骼系成人飲酒，於骨骼雖似無妨碍。但小兒正在發育時期，如飲酒過度，骨骼即不能健全發育，因之應響於身體之姿勢，及内部之各器官。　　（庚）排泄系腎臟之肌肉，亦因酒精之作用，變爲脂肪，腎中毛細管擴張，動作過勞，因是蛋白質由尿中排出。蛋白質爲有益人體之物，因不斷排出，遂得所謂［蛋白質尿症］。　　（辛）　遺傳飲酒者之子女，常呈柔弱狀態。經多次於動物身上實騐結果，有生殖力减低者，亦有不姙者。若以鷄卵浸於少許之酒精中，或酒精之蒸氣中，所孵得之雛，多屬畸形。尤以兩眼及其發育不全爲顯著。　　綜觀上述之酒於生理上之現象，酒精，即酒於人血之有害，實無可耀言</p>

<p>勢利眼  文炳　　故鄉心影錄　　回鄉本是我最畏忌的事，從前讀書的時候，一回鄉，免也不了鄉人的許多品評，説的説好，説的説壞，歸納起來不外是：這孩子似有造就，説話算還懂事，文章也還做得可以；不過讀洋書，最怕忘本，將來也定是個生不生熟不熟的假讀書人。　　可是由某幾方面看來，也還使我豪興。譬如剛從學校裏回去，頭幾天飲食總不會乾嘴的，不是這家請喝酒，便是那家請吃飯，洎至上學的時候，又不是這個送一塊鹹肉，便是那個送一包煑熟了的鷄蛋，這都是大人情，裏面包含著無限的希望，我自已也想，眞要努力讀書才對得他們住。　　在父母兄弟姊妹方面，那是更好，母親只躭心在學校裏没有火烤，是不是冷，平日没有零星食物吃，過不過得慣；父親只是盤問學校裏規矩緊不緊，上些什麽課，看些什麽書；分　了的哥哥，要請過去玩，吃東西；姊妹們替我洗衣服，上襪底，都是格外表示着親愛，格外看待得我好。　　我回去，他們不向我作要禮物的希望，就是衣服紥得破舊，他們反而看得起，説那是難得的好習尚，不學浮華。　　總之，那時無論在鄉人或家屬的眼裏，都没有勢利二字的色彩，只是赤忱的希望我努力讀書，認眞做人；不過我現在每每想着，實際上那已隱隱地伏下了勢利的根苗。　　現在不同了，今年我回去，便使我感到十三分勢利的迫害。　　當我抵家的那晚，前鄰後舍都異樣熱烈地來看我見面時，誰都是這麽一聲：［恭喜乂先生回府了，財喜好呵！］母親是去世了，没有寛心到，父親是喜形於色，兄弟姊妹也都親暱的圍上來。我知道他們的所以然，使我感到異樣的心跳，異樣的侷促，肚皮饑餓了，我只管狼噬般的嚼着我的飲食。　　大家都走開了，只有父親還在烤火，我的心似乎輕鬆了一些，色相也來得自然了，於是我提起精神，壯着膽，想向父親作一段落實的告罪，忽而我又有些不敢，因爲事實太使我困難，讀了一輩子的書，回家僅賸有一元零三角大洋票子，實在也是太對不起人了。　　然而若不告罪，惹得大家長此希望下去，那更不是辦法，我終於低訴似的説了：　　［父親，兒子僅回來一個光人，在外面眞没法賺到錢，使你老人家失望，請恕吧！］　　［兒子，我倒並不要緊，只是大家］希望得很，不使他們落空麽！］父親説話時的色相，倒還與前差不多，於是我方稍稍放了心。　　壞了，這没錢的消息一傳布出去，環境立刻換了顏色，鄰居都面嘘着我，也不稱贊了，也不攀話了，雖然當面時並没有向我作惡的批評。　　環境使我容忍不下，我緊切的想仍是外出飄流，可是我的天呀，一筆偌大的川資，那裏有着靠？我胆悸着在幾天以前便從開面向父親説，父親苦於心餘力竭，没法湊齊。明知有錢的三哥，向他借是説没有了，别人更不用説。　　這次我回家，也没有人請我吃過飯，也没有人送過我一塊鹹肉，原因很簡單，因爲我［學而優，未仕，］没有賺回錢，他們的心全都冷了。　　唉，這可怕的勢利眼！愛國的小販  警愚　　［阿要五香牛肉？……阿要五香牛］肉？……］這是牛肉阿炳對於他的營業上號召顧客的一種口號。　　他做此項買賣，將有靠十年的歷史，經騐所以豐憲得很，烹成的牛肉，總是芳香樸鼻，鮮美絕倫！因此深得一般顧客的讚許；遂在他這固有的名字之上，錫以牛肉二字的榮銜。　　他雖是一個小販；而其愛國之忱，倒也不落人後。自已固然目不識了，没有閲書看報的可能；然而偏喜向人探聽時事。前年知道日本佔據了東三省，他就憤激異常！旣而淞滬變起，越加咬牙切齒，目眥欲裂！馬上把家中所有的劣貨，盡行毁滅！而且勸人一致拒用！現在曉得榆關又復失陷，熱河形勢阽危；他更怒髮衝冠，不可遏抑！拒貨宣傳，益臻努力！　　　他是並不開起店舖，無非提着筐子，沿街喊賣。遇見顧客，等到交易旣畢；他就把倭奴的猖獗情形，乘間歷述一番，勸其須以愛國爲前提，弗再購用劣貨！説得激昻慷慨，酣暢淋漓！聞者多爲感動。　　他的吃飯傢伙，簡單不過；祗竹筐一隻，磁盆二具，一盛牛肉，一置牛筋。惟二盆質料不同，一則差小，確係國貨中的江西磁。其一則較巨，白地藍邊，絕像敵人的産品。他正對顧客演講的當兒，有一狀似學生的青年，遽把這大磁盆擎在手中，向着盆底一瞧，很奇異地道：［你這隻盆子，何嘗不是劣貨啊］！］　　［胡説！這盆底印的西洋文，明明］是西洋貨］。　　［你才胡説！明明印着是敵國的出］品］。　　［眞的嗎］？　　［誰來謊你］　　［那末，怎的劣貨，會印着西洋文］呢］？　　［西洋文原可隨便用的；你不見我］們中國人開的香烟公司，他的盒上罐上，不也印的盡是西洋文嗎］？　　他至此，若有所悟；頓時表現出深惡痛絕的樣子！就去尋了一張荷葉，把賣賸下來的牛肉，包裹起來，很使勁的，將那磁盆　成一個粉碎！［怕老婆必發財］的幾個原理  端父　　俗語説：［怕老婆，必發財，］這是一句天經地義的格言。從前在下不明白其中理由；足足想了二十四小時，忽然如我佛世尊的豁然大悟。原來現代社會裏，如政界的偉人，商界的領袖學界的巨子，怕老婆的朋友，没有不抖了起來，發財發福，面團團做了闊老。同時，抖了起來的朋友，面團團的闊老，雖然在外表瞧來，頣指氣使，威風凛凛，生殺在手，好不怕人：等到拆穿了西洋鏡，那一個不是梳妝跪跪的陳季常。這類事實，在現代社會裏，已經成了定律，眞是奇妙到不可思議。在下現在竟發明了他的原理，可説非常珍貴，奈端的發明地心吸力，愛因斯坦的發明相對論，他們的功績，也不過如此吧了。現在在下證明其原理如下：（一）懂得處世藝術處世的藝術，比任何習練處世的藝術，具了奮門的精神，所以結果成了社會上的聞人了，可是話要説回來了，鼎鼎大名的聞人，其先，因爲習練處世藝術而怕老婆，後來已經成功，何以仍然怕老婆，其中也自有道理：（一）因積重難反，妻權已經澎漲，當然不容易縮小；否則離威發了起來，豈不顏面有關，所謂［不是怕老婆，實是］求太平，］便是這個道理。（二）做了闊人，當然要求討姨太太，亨亨肉的决樂，偷偷摸摸，只恐家主婆知道，這又是闊人怕老婆的一個原因了。店員通訊錢在手頭  張執中編者先生：　　我不是一個拜金主義崇拜者，可是我現在感覺到金錢的重要了。我的家裏，雖並不要我寄錢回去維持，但在供給我中學畢業之後，再没有餘力來照顧我了。此後我的婚姻以及將來小家庭内的一切開支，就不免要自已張羅。我現在每月有三十餘元的進欵，吃的住的，都由他人供給，照自已想想，每月總該可以有餘；但事實上却又不然，非但没有積蓄，並且每逢到了二十號以後，手頭就非常拮据了。最希奇的，就是去年我的進益，每月祇有二十元，現在加了十餘元，却並不見得手頭寛舒。這究屬是什麽緣故呀？（下略）　　張執中謹上　　編者按：錢在手頭，食在口頭，是非用不可的。一個人每月多化十幾元，與節省十幾元，是不容易感覺到的。因原因爲人的慾望，是永遠不會滿足的。張君目下的情形，旣無家累，食宿又由人供給，那没有了二十元一月，是儘夠用的了，所以我們以爲張君應該在每月領到薪水後，至少把十元存於儲畜銀行，無論如何，不可動用。在起初的幾個月，决不要因爲數目太小而不屑爲，到得後來，自會成爲習慣：而且存數日多，你看了存摺的數目，保你會發生興趣，視儲蓄爲惟一樂事呢。大凡一件事，開始的時候，當然覺得乏味，當是等到成了習慣，也就樂此不疲了。儲蓄也是如此。店員通訊攔簡章（一）通訊宗旨本欄以集思廣益，解釋　　疑難問題，相互切磨，增進生活之　　幸福爲宗旨。（二）通訊對象本欄之對象，就人言，　　祇以店員學徒爲限，就地言，祗以　　本埠爲限。（三）通訊内容凡一切關於個人日常生　　活如：　　（一）職業（二）道德與學問上之修養（三）娛　　樂與運動（四）婚姻，以及其他旁及國　　家社會之問題，均所歡迎。如遇問　　題内容過於深奥而非本欄能力所及　　者，亦可介紹至本報［讀者顧問，］　　代爲解答之。（四）來信方式　　（一）信末須寫明姓名，年齡，籍貫　　，職業及詳細通訊處等項；繼續來　　信時仍須寫明。　　（二）來信文體不拘，惟以簡明易解爲主，並須繕寫清楚。　　（三）信面請寫明申報館本埠增刊店員通訊欄收字樣：如需回信，則并　　附郵票二分。（四）通訊者須將本欄所特刊之印花剪下，黏貼來信之左上角，不貼，恕不作答。（五）收到來信後之處理方法　　（一）凡所討論之問題，本報認爲有買獻大衆之價値者，得在報端披露之。小説煤山（續）  Ed　Falkiwiki著　志翔節譯　　彼特獨自走在大街上·雖然對然於路上的每一條裂痕或是每一根電桿，或是每一幢房子，他都很熟悉，但，在這寒光中，他却只感到驚異。大衆的喧閙聲，汽車的喇叭聲，電車的鐺鐺聲並不曾將他無生氣的夢温暖些。他望着大街南面的盡頭，那裏接連着鐵路，恰對着配錫撒尼車站。那班八點鐘從潑脱絲爾來的一列車快將開到。潑脱絲爾那裏有一監獄。這班車時常將很多住在城市的官吏和法官帶回市的家中來。　　彼特走在街上只感到異常的孤獨。他的骨節作痛着。時髦的律師和醫生，雖與他走在同一的路上，但，似乎是在另一世界似的和他們膜不相關。在他們肥胖的面目上表示自足的神氣。彼特看到他們的高興，覺着自身對於外界更隔絕了。他只覺着自身是屬於特來泊煤礦的？他在礦中的號目是一六六五。這號目已深深地烙印在他的腦海上。他永遠不過是一個號目！即使在這星期六晚上擁擠的人羣中。無論他到何處，煤礦似乎是永遠跟隨着他。礦坑中的黑影時常在他的心頭。　　乎廣大的球塲照耀得很明亮。一般城市中戴着禮帽的，時代化的青年很安閒地坐在擦皮鞋的椅子上。那些僅僅獲得一些小賬的侍者很勤奮地擦亮他們的皮鞋。空氣中充滿了計算棒球分數和評論拳術優劣的種種嘈雜聲。同時，骰子聲從後面一間房中發出來，球的聲音也從門縫中偷偷地透流出來。　　彼特看看盒中的雪茄。選擇了一枝他所喜歡的雪茄，咬去了烟頭，在火酒燈上燃着。那放出來的香氣徐徐地送下直到肺中，再徐徐地升上來，很適意地，從鼻腔中圍繞出來，他扣此爲興奮的香味所剌激。一枝雪茄减除了他的寂寞。在他的精神上似手鬆動些了！他自已漸漸地感到一些人生的意義了。（未完）</p>

<p>電影專刊出身貧苦的幾顆星  興之　　好萊塢有名的許多星，計算起來，出身於温飽之家的祇有十分之三，而出身於貧寒人家的共占有十分之七，這裏所叙述的，是這十分之七中最出身貧苦而最負盛名的幾個。　　瓊克勞馥做小女孩的時候，她的母親窮得養不活她，就送她到紐約一個小學校裏去當小女僕，她在那學校裏天天洗碗，擦桌子，洗地板，她看着那些鬧着玩着的小學生們，祇心熱得從眼中發火，她當了二年小女僕，向她母親吵着要讀書，那時她母親做工節下來有十幾塊錢，雖然捨不得用掉，但她可憐瓊没有上過學，就忍着痛給瓊讀書，瓊讀了一年書，她的母親再也没有力量供給她上學了，她從此又繼續她的奴僕生活，直到她流落到好萊塢在一家舞塲裏當舞女，才脱離了傭僕生活。　　愛德華羅賓生原藉是意大利人，他的父親在羅京辦理自由報，自任主筆，那時意大利革命，自由報得罪了革命黨人，他的父親，被逐出境，那時愛德華才十一歲，跟了他父親逃到美國，他父親潦倒窮途，在美國做了牛奶公司裏送奶車的馬夫，做了二年馬夫，和節衣縮食省下了幾個錢，仍舊在美國創辦報紙，以繼其未盡之志，那時，愛德華才十三歲，異常聰明，筆下已能寫了，他父親就呌他撰稿，每到星期六支用五分大洋薪水，愛德華的志向，也不過想當一個敎員或者傳敎師，初不料能在影壇上博得盛譽也。　　威廉鮑佛的父弟早死，威廉靠他姨母接濟而生活的，他到了十三歲，因爲没有錢，没有踏進過學校的門口，他的姨母出了七百元錢送他到戲劇學校裏去讀書，他在學校装因爲衣服檻樓，被同學們恥辱，祇有一個同學看得起他，就是李却狄克斯，後來鮑佛畢業，李却也可以算他的知音了。　　華萊斯皮雷的父親是個工匠，雖不是窮得没有飯吃，但也很窘迫，華萊斯小時候就跟了父親在工人一起，所以他現在演起劇來善於摑摹下等社會的人物。　　其他姐露拉彭克海，琪恩哈羅，雪爾娓雪妮，耐𡢃卡路等，都是貧家子女，面現在都發跡了。觀衆意見觀［重逢］以後  冬　　因爲要欣賞新俄的電影，特地從鄉間趕到上海來，但是觀衆一致推崇的［生路］已經映過了，我看到的是［重逢］。我相信，新俄的電影一定能夠給我們一些新的姿態，他們的電影决不是以企業爲目的的。　　看過了［重逢］以後，爲雨雪露霏的早春的夜半，他的確給了我許多新的認識，我相信，我　是不曾白費了我這次跋涉。　　新俄的電影，他們自從烏托洛夫的寫實電影運動鼓起了大波瀾以後，他們的電影已經脱了一切電影業上的舊的遺産而開始了他的新的步驟，他們的新的影片是利用編輯的，他們廢棄了理想的劇本，人工的背景等等，由從事電影者去隨時隨地攝取實在的景物，然後把他們設法聯系起來，成爲一部新的創作。［重逢］就是利用編輯的方法製作的。因爲他們是新的，是不曾見過的，所以或則有人看了不慣，但是這也僅僅不過是不慣罷了。　　［重逢］的内容，大致是講一個革命的領袖，他是爲着革命，爲着實業的建設而犧牲了他的性命，他是死了，革命的建設是不能停止的，一切的事業都在迅速地進行着，但是，在這個建設的過程中，還有不少的隱憂，這些隱憂往往會阻碍我們革命的進程。可是不要緊，意志可以克服一切感情的錯誤而使革命永遠不脱出他的正軌。末了，他照示我們説，五年計劃終於在四年内完成了。　　這新的影片，我們决不可以拿舊的範圍去批評他。因爲，這是事實，他們一點也不撒謊，他們把新俄的實情來告訴我們。評重逢  玉虹　　我未曾看過［生路］，所以現在不能用來與［重逢］相比較，不過在生路偉大盛名的餘威下，這都重逢似乎是遜色了。　　這片的事實，是述一個蘇俄革命領首，於五年計劃成功紀念會中，因回憶昔年革命之艱辛，竟而昏厥，後因至黑海休養，更回憶其昔年參戰之經過，並因訪其故友，而發現其十二年前已經違捕而濳逃之逆黨女間諜，尚在其友處繼續進行其破壞工作！　　在喪情方面，除了Ｍouzalevsky外，其餘的都很平淡。而於女間諜之濳逃後，與鐵甲車中途抗敵時的行動，都太弛緩，不能表現出當時緊張的情形！　　在技巧方面亦未見精彩，同時因全片二分之一以上的事實，都是由［追憶］而得來的，所以導演一面要顧到往事的迴映一面要表現目前的表情，所以頗有手足撩亂之概。　　最後我希望各戲院應多注意華文説明字幕等，尤其是這種俄片德片。因爲目下識英文者雖屬不少，識俄德文者實不多見，所以在片中重要的談話與關節，都應加以詳細的釋幕，否則雖是很小的地方，也會失去全片的精神與義意的。春風楊柳公映有期  女聖　　大東公司有聲巨片，［春風楊柳］，係由和合公司竺清賢氏，自已製造之收音機攝製，劇中描寫大學生男女同學之種種生活，極盡烘托之能事，由汪福慶君導演，併自任主角，按君在國製影片界之歷史最早，卽前十年商務書館出版之［好兄弟］影片，卽由君任主角矣，女主角爲楊耐梅，其次如夏佩珍胡笳陳一棠韓蘭根等，男女重要人物，均極珠聯璧合之妙，聲音歌曲，又極清晰嘹亮，聞不日卽將在本外埠各大戲院公映，屆時轟動遐邇，可預卜也。［春風楊柳］中之一幕嘉寳將入米高梅  時春　　葛萊泰嘉寳現已起來美，米高梅公司已派員接洽，嘉寳已允人米高梅，並已訂立合同，今後好萊塢又將出現此怪女子失。派拉蒙與黛德麗訟涉  愼其　　曼琳黛德麗自馮史登堡赴印度後，卽向派拉蒙聲言解約，派拉蒙因爲她没有履行合同上的義務提出訟訴，要黛德麗賠賞十八萬二千八百五十元，而進行訟涉之時馮史登堡已回好萊塢，並允繼續導演黛麗的片子，於是派拉蒙撤回訟訴，並向黛德麗道歉，現黛德麗已繼續工作矣。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram, Tang Yulin received a report from the front at noon on the 27th: 1. Japanese troops launched a three-pronged general offensive on Rehe; one route attacked Chifeng from Lu, one route attacked Lingnan from Suizhong, and one route attacked Lingyuan from Yaolugou. Our forces stationed in the Yebaishou area are blocking the enemy's westward advance. 2. More than 2,000 enemy cavalrymen from the Mitake and Motegi units, together with the rebel army led by Shao Benliang, engaged in fierce fighting with our army at Chuangbanyingzi on the night of the 26th. 3. At 5:00 p.m. on the 26th, our army recaptured Guojia Chapeng, Baiyaozi, and other places. Currently, our troops on all fronts are fighting valiantly. (Special telegram on the 27th) (Beiping) The enemy troops in Lingnan are the Hattori Brigade and the Suzuki Brigade, etc. The number of troops has decreased compared to before, and it seems that some have been transferred to Chaoyang. According to Dong Futing's report, three Japanese military trains arrived at Koubeiyingzi on the evening of the 26th, with approximately 5,000 soldiers. They had already passed Chaoyang and advanced westward on the morning of the 27th, engaging in fierce fighting with our army in the Damiao area northwest of Chaoyang. This route of Japanese troops is spying on Jianping, threatening Chifeng. A large number of Japanese cars prepared to cross the Rehe Desert have arrived in Kailu, but the trial runs are difficult. The plan to cross the desert and attack Chifeng may be abandoned, which is also one of the reasons why they are currently attacking Jianping from the Chaoyang area and then spying on Chifeng. In recent days, the Japanese army's battle plan has been to attack Lingnan first and then move towards Jianping, seemingly with a conspiracy to divide our forces. Our side has taken strict measures to cope with this. (Special telegram on the 27th) (Tianjin) After the Suzuki Brigade concentrated all its forces in Chaoyang on the morning of the 26th, it split into two routes. One route moved towards Lingyuan to attack the rear of Ling and Ling. A clash occurred between Pingfangzi and Bolochi on the morning of the 27th. The other route moved towards Jianping, and a conflict occurred between Damiao and Laohushan with our army on the morning of the 27th. Several enemy planes bombed Lingyuan, Jianping, Yebaishou, and other places on the morning of the 27th and distributed leaflets, advising foreign missionaries to leave the war zone quickly. On the Lingnan front, the fighting was fierce from morning to dusk on the 26th. The total number of enemy and puppet troops in that area reached more than 20,000. On the morning of the 27th, they came into contact with our volunteer army between Naiman Wangfu and Wushijiazi. According to reliable information, the Japanese army plans to use poison gas and smoke bombs if Lingyuan and Jianping are not easy to attack. A large number of poison gas shells are currently being transported to Chaoyang. (Special telegram on the 27th) (Tokyo) The Japanese-Manchu army is still advancing from several locations. However, the Ministry of the Army also frankly admits that when the Japanese army encounters the official Chinese army in the future, fierce battles will be inevitable. It is reported that the Chinese army is currently preparing to put up strong resistance on the Chifeng-Lingyuan front. The Hattori Brigade, which advanced from Suizhong to attack the right flank of the Chinese army, has been blocked northeast of Lingyuan. This is the only serious resistance encountered so far. It is reported that the Suzuki Brigade has dispatched a detachment from Chaoyang to advance rapidly southwest, attempting to outflank the rear of the Chinese army confronting the Hattori Brigade. (Reuters telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It has now been confirmed that the Japanese attack on Rehe is not as easy as they had imagined. The attack on Baishizui has now failed, so the Japanese army has shifted its focus to Damiao, the northern end of the Chinese army's position west of Chaoyang. The area is ten miles from Chaoyang, and fierce fighting broke out this morning. The Japanese army has advanced from Kailu to Xiawa, which is located midway on the Kailu-Chifeng highway, seventy miles south of Kailu. (Reuters telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There were many casualties in yesterday's battle at Baishizui. According to the official report released today, the Japanese army suffered 600 casualties at Baishizuishuan. (Reuters telegram on the 27th) (Beiping) Our army's positions at Baiyaoliang and other places in Chaoyang are still in fierce fighting. According to a telegram from Brigade Commander Dong, his troops launched a counterattack on the Baisakaying position at 7:00 p.m. on the 25th and completely recaptured it in the late night. They are currently confronting the enemy. Fierce fighting has been taking place in the Baishizuimen area on the Lingnan border since the morning of the 26th, and the enemy has not made any progress. After Mizigou and other places near Koumenkou were captured by the volunteer army on the 25th, they were scattered by the enemy from Wanjiatun. The enemy's reinforcements on that front rely solely on the Suizhong route. The volunteer armies of Zheng Guilin and others are engaging the enemy separately in the Lishugoumen and Mingshui areas to contain their actions. (Special telegram on the 27th) (Beiping) Dong Futing telegraphed Ping tonight, stating that his troops are now concentrated on the west bank of the Daling River. (Special telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram: Today, enemy and puppet cavalry fought fiercely with our Cui Brigade all day near Naiman Wangfu. Our army was a hundred times braver, killing countless enemies. More than 400 enemy cavalry horses were buried in the desert. At the same time, Feng Zhanhai's troops also advanced north from Xiawa, and after fighting for more than five hours, the enemy and puppet cavalry retreated north one after another. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram: Yang Yinpu, the commander of the Second Brigade of the rebel army Ding Qiang's unit, led more than 2,000 troops to Liujiazi to revolt, joining Wang Xianting's unit, with complete uniforms and weapons. (Special telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Chengde, Reuters reporter inspected Rehe Province today, passing through Pingquan and reaching Lingyuan. The troops along the way were extremely excited. What is especially commendable is that the civilians showed no signs of panic and remained calm even when Japanese planes were heavily bombing. Such is the demeanor of the civilians, so the spirit of the soldiers can be imagined. Yesterday, a Japanese plane dropped a bomb over Yebaishou Village near Lingyuan, killing a child. The reporter said, "I heard the sound of planes and bombs exploding, but I did not see any signs of panic among the villagers. The villagers seem to be determined to resist the enemy." Japanese planes have now begun to heavily bomb along the main road. Today, a Japanese plane attempted to bomb a convoy of cars carrying refugees leaving Chaoyang, as they had previously bombed refugee trains in the Northeast. Today, a woman was killed by a bomb twenty miles southwest of Lingyuan, but none of the cars were hit. (Reuters telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram at 3:00 p.m. on the 26th: Since the Japanese and puppet troops launched a general offensive on the 25th, the fighting on all fronts has become increasingly fierce. According to reports from the front, after our army in Kailu changed to a new defense line, the enemy continued to advance south of Lu. Although the enemy's goal on this route is Chifeng, the march is extremely difficult because the area between south of Lu and Jianping Lintong is purely an alluvial area of the Lao Ha River and the La Shaolun River, making weapons such as tanks useless. The cars recently transported by the enemy from Shenyang were originally intended to be used to transport troops forward, but as a result, they are still parked in the Kailu area due to the obstruction of the desert. Today, enemy and puppet cavalry fought fiercely with our Cui Brigade near Naiman Wangfu all day. Our army was a hundred times braver, killing countless enemies. More than 400 enemy cavalry horses were buried in the desert. At the same time, Feng Zhanhai's troops also advanced north from Xiawa, and after fighting for more than five hours, the enemy and puppet cavalry retreated north one after another.

<p>After receiving the League of Nations' invitation to participate in the Advisory Committee, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov only stated that he would take it back and submit it to the government. However, the public at the League of Nations predicted that he would decline to participate. Some people believed that Soviet Russian diplomatic tactics were unfathomable, and it was not yet possible to predict whether they would participate or not. Although the United States' reply to the League of Nations expressed strong agreement, it did not mention whether it would participate or not. Therefore, people in the League of Nations were not very satisfied with the lack of enthusiasm from the United States. Some people believed that with the change of government in the United States imminent, the new president would definitely make a more concrete announcement after taking office.</p>
<p>The League of Nations is in a very anxious situation, hoping that the United States and Russia will participate to increase its power to deal with Japan. However, even if the United States and Russia do participate, how much power can the League of Nations increase? The greatest power of the League of Nations lies in its right to impose sanctions on Japan. However, observing the divergent opinions and conflicting interests of the major European powers, let alone Russia and the United States, even the countries in the League of Nations that uphold justice are afraid that none of them has the courage to resolutely implement sanctions. Leaving aside the issue of economic sanctions, what other methods are there to increase the power of the League of Nations? Some say that prohibiting the import of arms into the Far East is a major force in eliminating the Sino-Japanese War. Banning arms shipments to Japan but not to China would further demonstrate the power to sanction Japan. However, solely transporting them to China is also a concern, as they might be intercepted by Japan. Furthermore, many opinions still express opposition. Therefore, it is not yet possible to predict whether this issue can become a reality. Therefore, we are not so sure how much so-called power the League of Nations actually has.</p>
<p>Japan is able to understand the power of the League of Nations, so the Japanese representative dared to resolutely leave Geneva without any concern. It is only because it is able to understand the power of the League of Nations that it does not need to formally withdraw from the League of Nations urgently. The departure of the representative from Geneva indicates its contempt for the League of Nations and its refusal to obey. By not formally withdrawing from the League of Nations immediately, it indicates that it is temporarily leaving the League of Nations for an opportunity to maneuver. If the League of Nations does not exert greater pressure with real strength, then there will be a good day to meet again in the future. Japan knows the League of Nations well. Therefore, on the one hand, it exerts all its strength to attack Jehol. On the other hand, it can distance itself from the League of Nations and wait calmly for changes in the international situation. If the participation of the United States and Russia ultimately cannot be realized, and the proposal to ban the transportation of arms to Japan also turns out to be just a bubble, then what else does Japan have to fear?</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that even if the League of Nations Advisory Committee is established, there will still be many changes in the international situation thereafter. Will these changes be beneficial to us or to Japan? If it is beneficial to us, at most, it will complete the League of Nations' work of moral sanctions. If it is beneficial to Japan, then the heat of international tensions will silently dissipate, and the atmosphere of global clarity will be once again shrouded in dark clouds. I do not know what situation China will be plunged into. In this crisis-ridden situation, there is no second path to survival for our people other than fighting to the death to save ourselves.</p>

<p>Although Feeling Gratified, Not Satisfied</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, this place claimed that although the United States' reply to the League of Nations stated its agreement with the League of Nations' conclusions on the Manchurian case, it still failed to fully meet the League of Nations' expectations. However, people in the League of Nations, although feeling that the tone of the telegram seemed to lack enthusiasm, were quite gratified by its support and believed that the reason for the telegram's not very enthusiastic wording was that Stimson did not want to unnecessarily provoke Japan. The telegram did not mention whether the United States would participate in the Advisory Committee. Therefore, those in the League of Nations who were more cautious believed that the participation of the United States was not yet certain. However, the majority believed that the United States would try to align its policies with the League of Nations as much as possible without endangering its friendship with Japan. Moreover, since the US government was about to change, it was impossible to expect it to make a more concrete declaration at this time. The Republican government might want to wait until the Democratic government took office before announcing its policies. (26th Kuomintang Electric)</p>

<p>Hymans Announces Resignation</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Belgian representative Hymans has definitively announced that he is unwilling to serve as the chairman of the Twenty-One Committee. Although he has agreed to discuss this matter with the Belgian government, the Belgian government will definitely agree with his opinion. Therefore, who will be the chairman of the Twenty-One Committee has not yet been determined. This is the first issue to be decided at the next meeting of the committee. Some parties have said that they will ask the US representative to take this seat, but this statement is not widely believed. Because the committee is an organization of the League of Nations, it is naturally inconvenient to have a person outside the League as the chairman. Also, it is not widely agreed that the representative of a small country should be the chairman. Given that the Sino-Japanese issue has now reached a stage where the committee must make very important decisions, or even adopt sanctions, it is believed that it is appropriate for the representative of a major country with significant interests in the Far East to serve as the chairman. If the committee proposes firm measures and a major country refuses to implement them, the committee will be in a deadlock, which is not appropriate. Therefore, under these circumstances, it seems that the only qualified candidates to be elected as chairman are Britain and France. The great interests of these two countries in the Far East are universally recognized. Germany and Italy cannot compete with them. If the chairman in the future is the British representative or the French representative, then this committee will naturally be more powerful. (27th Reuters Electric)</p>

<p>(Moscow) A report received here from Khabarovsk stated that the situation on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is now becoming increasingly dangerous. Fully armed "Red Beard" bandit gangs, often in front of the Japanese army, openly intrude into railway stations, bureaus, and staff residences, carrying out looting, and even destroying railway tracks, attempting to overturn trains. Although the railway authorities have requested protection, the "puppet Manchukuo" and the Japanese army have not taken any measures to prevent this harassment or to arrest the bandits who carry out the robbery after the fact.

There are occasional attacks by bandits on stations and police stations. Although there are Japanese troops along the line, the bandits are not afraid at all and continue to carry out robberies. Afterwards, they are still able to escape scot-free. Moreover, there have been many instances of bandits dismantling the railway and robbing trains. Although the railway bureau has requested relief from the Japanese and Manchukuo authorities, both the "Manchukuo" authorities and the Japanese army have not stopped the actions of these people.

<p>(London) News from the Far East said that the British Foreign Secretary Simon had stated to Japan that if the Japanese army's actions were limited to Jehol, the British government would not oppose the Japanese military's actions in Jehol. A Reuters reporter today questioned the British Foreign Office about this statement in London. The British Foreign Office immediately and firmly denied it, saying that Foreign Secretary Simon had not seen the Japanese ambassador for two weeks, so how could such a statement have been made? Furthermore, the British government's attitude has always been consistent with the attitude of the report passed by the League of Nations General Assembly last Friday. (26th Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>(London) The Shanghai News published that British Foreign Secretary Simon had notified the Japanese government that if the Japanese and Manchukuo armies attacked Jehol and limited it to that province, the British government would not oppose this action. This has now been firmly denied by the local authorities. Upon investigation, this news was transmitted by the Japanese United News Agency, which stated that before beginning the attack on Jehol, Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida had inquired about the attitudes of the British, American, French, Italian, and German ambassadors stationed in Tokyo. Only Britain replied that "[if the Japanese and Manchukuo armies' operations do not exceed the scope of Jehol Province, the British government has no objection to this action]." In addition to formally denying this news, the British Foreign Office also stated that the British government supports the League of Nations' resolution that the Japanese army should withdraw from Manchuria with a resolute and unquestionable attitude. Furthermore, it is learned that the US government has agreed with Britain's attitude. As for the proposal to ban the transportation of arms to China and Japan, official sources have revealed that the British government has refused to approve a ban specifically against Japan because any arms transported to China are likely to be seized by the Japanese fleet. Therefore, this plan is difficult to be effective. (26th Zilinbao Special Dispatch)</p>

The Labour Party does not agree with the Japanese government's policies, but it does not change its friendship with the Japanese people because of this.</p>

<p>Although the war has not been formally declared, it is a fact that the Japanese army is sweeping through Manchuria, massacring Chinese people, and destroying their homes. If this is not war, then any rational person would want to know what is war. If the League of Nations wants to prove its ability, then it must act quickly in the future. Otherwise, before the League of Nations can make a resolution, the war will have passed. Lansbury also said that the recognition of "Manchukuo" is an act of blatant disregard for external obligations, and the possibility of a Russo-Japanese war cannot be ignored. It would be crazy to regard Japan's current effort to contain communism as its actual policy. Lansbury was repeatedly interrupted by the Conservatives during his speech. Lansbury continued to say that if Britain is not prepared to uphold the League of Nations covenant that Japan has broken, then Britain should withdraw from the League of Nations. We should tell Japan directly that since Japan has broken its promises, we can no longer provide it with any assistance. We do not need to wait for the committee's report. A member interjected and asked Lansbury if he wanted the British navy to stop American arms ships going to Japan. Lansbury replied that the United States, both government and public, will do what it should do. He believed that the United States' decision must be in accordance with the rules. Lansbury then requested a ban on the transportation of finance, cotton, and all items beneficial to Japan to Japan.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Simon replied that the Far East issue should be dealt with on the basis that Britain wants to maintain good friendship with both China and Japan. This is the basis on which we proceed. Mediation is something that the League of Nations should do for the time being. Mediation is the first step, but if mediation unfortunately fails, then the opinions unanimously agreed upon by the League of Nations' own committee should be adopted. The situation is serious and progressing with each passing day. The Japanese army's deep penetration violates the League of Nations Covenant. Japan's unauthorized actions are not permitted by the League of Nations Covenant. There is no doubt that Japan's actions do not conform to the Covenant. However, Japan is in a great dispute and has experienced very difficult experiences. The neighboring countries it is dealing with are very difficult to deal with, and its legal status in Manchuria is a special event in world history. If these facts are not recognized, then Japan is not being treated fairly. Britain has complete and appropriate participation in the League of Nations' actions. The League of Nations' actions greatly contribute to world peace. Arms embargoes must be implemented effectively through international agreements. The British government has decided that, pending an international solution, it will no longer issue export licenses for arms to China or Japan from today. The details of these arms have been published in the 1931 Arms Embargo Order. It is not appropriate for Britain to make a distinction on arms embargoes between the two warring countries alone. The government firmly believes that any effort or sacrifice that can reduce the danger of expanding the war zone or prolonging bloodshed is worth doing. Foreign Secretary Simon ended by saying that this embargo does not apply to existing purchase contracts because such contracts must be respected.</p>

Even if the British government does not agree to support this move, some small countries may be able to provide assistance and propose it to the League of Nations. Rodney opposed supplying arms to warring countries, saying that Britain should first immediately ban arms shipments to the Far East, without waiting for other countries to decide. According to Rodney, Japan has been provoked to some extent and should be given some sympathy, but its current actions cannot be defended. (26th Reuters Electric)</p>

Since being entrusted to Japanese rule, various military facilities have been added to become a base for submarine fleets. In wartime, it is sufficient to disrupt world merchant ships. If Japan loses these islands, it will not be able to gain an advantage in naval warfare. Therefore, it should use appropriate terms to refuse the League of Nations' recovery of the South Pacific islands, or use war to intimidate. (2) There is no need to withdraw from the disarmament conference because the United States, Russia, and other non-League of Nations members are all participating, and there are constraints from the Washington Treaty and the London Treaty, so rash action cannot be taken. At a minimum, representatives must be sent to perfunctorily participate. (3) Economic blockade sanctions may not be possible due to severe conflicts of interest between countries. If it is implemented, the Japanese Navy is prepared to resist with force. Today's League of Nations is no longer something that empty propaganda can achieve. (China United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An international expert said that the League of Nations entrusted Japan to administer the Mariana Islands. The political organ is located in Saipan. Currently, there are approximately 17,624 Japanese and 48,830 local people, mostly living on the southern islands. The northern islands are still uninhabited. Because the Caroline Islands produce coral, they are also called the Coral Islands, formed by the collection of 549 coral islets. The Pohnpei and Palau islands are larger. Pohnpei has 8,586 residents, Yap has 6,818 residents, and Palau has 8,010 residents, mostly of Malay descent. In addition, there are merchants from China and Japan. The Caroline Islands are divided into eastern and western parts. The political center of the Eastern Caroline Islands is Chuuk and Pohnpei. Chuuk has 595 Japanese, 10,969 local people, and 20 foreigners. Pohnpei has 649 Japanese, 7,914 local people, and 23 foreigners. The political center of the Western Caroline Islands is Yap and Babeldaob. Yap has 265 Japanese, 6,545 local people, and 8 foreigners. The Marshall Islands are formed by the collection of two rows of islets, with Jaluit as the political center, having 335 Japanese, 9,356 local people, and 17 foreigners. There are 22 elementary schools. The finances of each island are self-sufficient. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, the League of Nations naturally has the right to convene a general assembly to discuss whether to continue entrusting the management of the islands north of the equator in the Pacific to Japan. If Japan regards these islands as the lifeline of the navy, then Japan clearly intends to use the islands to be an enemy of the world. The League of Nations can retrieve the islands and entrust them to another country for administration. Another explanation is that Germany did not cede these lands to any country, only allowing them to be handed over to the League of Nations. Therefore, the issue of sovereignty over the governing territory is still questionable, and it is even clearer that Japan cannot currently consider them its own. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Hoover Approves Congressional Restrictions on Withdrawals. Roosevelt and Hull Emphasize Bank Closures. State Legislatures Urgently Discuss Preventing the Spread of the Crisis.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 26th - The bank crisis in Maryland and Michigan is now receiving attention from President-elect Roosevelt and future Secretary of State Hull. The Washington Financial Relief Society is currently considering lending to banks in Baltimore and Detroit. According to a report from Lima, Ohio, the First American Trust Company has decided to allow withdrawals of 2% of deposits. Yesterday, the Governor of Maryland announced a three-day holiday for all banks and financial institutions in the state to discuss measures to curb large withdrawals. The eight-day holiday for banks in Michigan has now been extended. After being passed by both houses of Congress yesterday, a bill authorizing the Comptroller of the Currency to impose limited withdrawal restrictions on more than 6,000 banks in the United States with deposits totaling $17,000,000,000 was signed and approved by President Hoover today. It becomes law.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 26th - Since the financial crisis occurred in Michigan, followed by the closure of banks in Maryland for three days, and the restriction of withdrawals by depositors in four other states, the American people's confidence in banks has been greatly shaken. Small depositors are rushing to withdraw their savings deposits. Therefore, the United States is currently discussing ways to reassure the public about the stability of the financial community. Private sources speculate that the Treasury Department or the Federal Reserve Bank may issue a guarantee declaration. Others believe that if a declaration is issued by senior officials, public panic can be greatly reduced. Still others believe that after President Hoover signs the Goldsborough Banking Emergency Act, national banks can assist state banks, and it will not be difficult to overcome the crisis even if there is a run on banks.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Tallmadge (Ohio), 26th - After holding an emergency meeting today, the Tallmadge City Council ordered all banks in the city to temporarily suspend payments for one day (some say three days) in order to allocate cash. After meeting with Ohio Governor White and prominent bankers in Tallmadge, he stated that there was no need to declare a statewide suspension of payments in the financial community. This was only due to excessive withdrawals. It is recently heard that the clearing houses in Akron and Lima in this state have voted to restrict depositors from withdrawing no more than 1% of their deposits each month until the financial situation improves. Indianapolis has also restricted withdrawals to 5%.</p>
<p>Reuters, Columbus, 27th - Eighteen banks in Ohio, located in Cleveland, Akron, and Dayton, have suspended withdrawals today because the state is about to issue a temporary emergency bill. These eighteen banks have a total of $81.5 million in deposits.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Detroit, 26th - The Union Guardian Trust Company, which triggered the American financial crisis this time, will now be taken over and reorganized by automobile magnate Ford. According to the Detroit Free Press, Ford contributed a total of $8.25 million to reorganize the trust company and the First National Bank, and Ford will appoint directors to completely manage it. Reuters, New York, 26th - After the financial crisis occurred in Michigan, Maryland announced the closure of banks for three days yesterday, which was viewed by the public as a sign of the overall unsound state of American banks. The American Financial Relief Society has the authority to alleviate this situation, but it did not provide relief and allowed the banks to close for three days. The public pointed out that this was evidence that the banks involved failed to provide the collateral required by the Financial Relief Society for loans. Maryland is very important from a financial observation point of view because the state has a very large insurance industry. Withdrawals increased in the middle of last week. Bankers reported that withdrawals in Baltimore alone reached $12 million. Considering the state's $500 million in deposits, this number seems very small, but it should be noted that $6 million was withdrawn on Friday alone. The announcement of the bank holiday has led to rumors that other states will follow suit. The Maryland legislature is currently drafting ways to quickly open banks. The legislature may find a way to open banks early, but will restrict withdrawals indefinitely. At the same time, merchants are allowed to make purchases on credit. According to Washington news, the Financial Relief Society may try to help the banking industry overcome the difficulties, but negotiations will be conducted in secret because publishing the detailed methods by which the society provides loans to banks in the past has resulted in losses.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 27th - Mitchell, Chairman of the National City Bank of New York, resigned today. Mitchell explained the reason for his resignation, saying that the public misunderstood the testimony obtained when the Senate Banking and Currency Committee heard testimony last week, resulting in criticism of him. He did not want the bank to be affected as a result, so he resigned as chairman.</p>

<p>Major Changes in Diplomatic Representatives</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 26th - The inauguration of the new American President Roosevelt is this Saturday. Therefore, the focus of Washington's public attention has shifted from Congress to the President's inauguration and the new President's policies on the three issues of economic war debts and the Far East. Even street talk is focused on this. The frequent meetings between the new and old Secretaries of State, Hull and Stimson, are enough to arouse public attention to the Manchurian crisis. As for the selection of the new cabinet, because the various important positions have already been announced one after another, the outside world is not paying much attention. Today, Roosevelt announced the appointment of Wallace as Secretary of Agriculture and Postmaster General Farley. The Republican figures in the current cabinet have already packed their personal belongings and moved to private residences to prepare for the handover. With the exception of the Department of State, almost all the key officials of the various departments have left. Roosevelt's inaugural address is being kept strictly confidential, and even his close confidants do not know its contents.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 26th - It is now expected that after the Democratic Party takes power on March 4th, there will be major changes in American representatives abroad. All ambassadors and ministers who are affiliated with political parties will naturally leave with the Republican Party. It is difficult to predict whether general professional talents will not be removed by the Democratic Party's long-awaited patronage. As a rule, when the president changes, representatives abroad, regardless of whether they have political affiliations, must resign once. If the scope of the Democratic Party's changes extends to professional talents, even the ministers and ambassadors stationed in the ten countries of South America, such as Brazil, and the two countries of the Far East, China and Japan, are in danger of being changed. As for the three major ambassadors stationed in Mexico, Chile, and Cuba, all of them have political affiliations and are naturally on the list to be replaced. When Roosevelt was first elected, there were indications that the diplomatic community should rely on professional talents and should not hastily make changes. However, at present, general politicians are engaging in surrounding pressure and want to seize the positions of professional talents and then be happy. At a time when diplomatic problems are very complicated and require reliance on experienced people, it is expected that even if there are changes in general professional talents, they will be carried out slowly.</p>

<p>Advocating for Lower Tariffs in Various Countries</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th - On Sunday, Hitler and the cabinet members were engaged in election campaigns. The speeches they made were largely about internal affairs. Only the Minister of Economy and Agriculture, Hugenberg, touched on international issues. Many of the listeners were from various countries. Hugenberg's speech was broadcast to the United States. Hugenberg briefly outlined the key points of the beneficial work of the World Economic Conference, one of which was the resolution of the international debt issue. Unless this goal is achieved, the results of the conference will be as small as those of previous international conferences. Hugenberg also said that Germany is determined to fulfill its obligations, but its creditors must help it to be able to do so because Germany only considers the amount of its surplus exports to determine its ability to pay. In recent times, countries have built high tariff barriers, causing Germany's exports to rapidly decline. It is hoped that countries will reduce tax rates to alleviate Germany's difficulties. Germany is working hard to rescue the country and economic undertakings, and especially hopes that the United States will show sympathy. The US government's rejection of signing the Treaty of Versailles, which contained various oppressive conditions, is especially appreciated.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 26th - Federal Minister of the Interior Frick, in a speech before the deposed Crown Prince, said that the militaristic ideas of Prussia and the liberal ideas of Weimar are not absolutely incompatible. However, the Weimar Constitution, which was formulated during the German revolution, its spirit is not in line with the hearts of the German people. He also said that this constitution has no traditional ideas as its foundation and is a product of defeat. Frick believes that the military ideas and freedom of the nation should be consolidated according to the ideals of Prussian princes and officials. He concluded that the German people should express confidence in the National Socialist Party, but the National Socialist Party cannot make up for the losses Germany has suffered in the past fourteen years in a short period of time.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th - Riots broke out again throughout the country on Sunday, especially in the western provinces. A total of five people were killed and dozens injured.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th - The Australian High Commissioner to the UK, Bruce, this afternoon, accompanied by the British Ambassador to Germany, had an audience with the German President, representing the Australian government and people to return the nameplate of the German warship Emden. The ship went out to attack Allied warships in the early days of the European War and achieved remarkable feats. It was sunk by the Australian cruiser Sydney near the Cocos Islands on November 9, 1914. Now, the Australian state is returning the spoils of war to show friendship. The German authorities accepted it and will place it in the new cruiser Emden to remain immortal. This afternoon, Bruce gave a long speech, and the German President replied in the same way. Both sides spoke of promoting friendship. Afterwards, Foreign Minister Neurath hosted a banquet to entertain the Australian representatives.</p>

<p>Havas, Geneva, 27th - The Air Force Committee of the Disarmament Conference held a meeting this morning. The Belgian representative clearly stated his support for the French proposal to internationalize civil aircraft. The British representative criticized the French plan from a financial point of view. Representatives from Italy and Germany both opposed the internationalization of civil aircraft. Although the Italian representative raised objections to the French plan, he expressed support for the prohibition of aerial bombing. The German representative advocated the immediate abolition of naval and military aircraft, even saying that if naval and military aircraft are not abolished, Germany will refuse to discuss civil aircraft.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Japanese Communist Party Attempts to Disrupt All of Manchuria <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>With the Aim of Opposing the Manchurian Incident</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported on the 21st that thought criminals apprehended in Manchuria, primarily Japanese, [the Third Incident of Japanese Communist Elements in Manchuria], had been publicly released for publication on January 25th. The Kwantung Government immediately issued the following outline on the same day: Before the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, a Manchurian Local Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party was organized in Dalian. Soon after, it was cracked down upon. Subsequently, the Manchurian Red Relief Society was reorganized, publishing the Relief News twice a month. Furthermore, the Third Congress of the Japanese Red Relief Society was held in Tokyo, dispatching organizational members, renaming it the Dalian Regional Committee of the Japanese Red Relief Manchurian Region, uniting with comrades in mainland Japan, attempting to disrupt all of Manchuria. At the same time, colluding with the Japanese Proletarian Cultural League, a preparatory meeting for the council was convened in Dalian, striving to rebuild the Manchurian Cooperative. An outer organ of the Manchurian Local Affairs Bureau, namely the Manchurian Labor Union Council, was established in Shenyang, with branch offices set up in Fushun, Dalian, etc., publishing the [Manchurian Cooperative News], joining the All-Japan Cooperative. On January 21st, a meeting of councilors of the South Manchuria Railway Company employees' association was convened, discussing the improvement of employee treatment, taking the opportunity to distribute leaflets in Shenyang, Dalian, Fushun, and other places, announcing the truth about the South Manchuria Railway, planning to implement it regularly. At that time, the [Red Relief] and the [Manchurian Cooperative] adopted the same steps, advocating that the masses rise up together at the appointed time. On the night of the 25th, thousands of unstable leaflets were discovered in various places. At this point, the Kwantung Government, in coordination with the Dalian District Court Procuratorate, began a crackdown, arresting all the important remaining Red Party members from February 1st to 13th. It was discovered that the true purpose of such outer organs of the Communist Party was originally to publicize the lifeline region of Japan, especially to publicize and incite [absolute opposition to the Manchurian Incident], it is said.</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 24th, before the September 18th Incident, there was a considerable organization of Japanese Communist Party members in the Three Eastern Provinces. After the incident, out of resentment towards the atrocities of the Japanese militarists, they rose up in activity, attempting to harass the rear of the Japanese army. Recently, Japanese Communist Party members organized the [Manchurian Red Relief Society] in Shenyang, and separately organized the [Manchurian Labor Union Council] in Shenyang, Fushun, and Dalian, in order to engage in grassroots work, connect with the working class, and in one fell swoop, make all of Northeast China Red. Recently, the South Manchuria Railway employees' demand to improve treatment was instigated by the party. Recently, due to a leak of information, a dozen or so party members were arrested in Dalian. Mr. Yoshimasa Ishimoto, a key member of the party's executive committee, was recently arrested on Chiyoda Street in Shenyang, and party member Mr. Yasuo Otani was arrested at Fushun Station. As for the contents of the party, Japanese officials have yet to gain a full understanding, it is said.</p>
<p>A Hualian dispatch from Tokyo on the 27th reported that the Fascist National League held an emergency meeting at its headquarters this afternoon to discuss the prevention of domestic Redization, stating that the government had arrested over eight thousand Communist Party members last year. In less than two months this year, it has already exceeded five hundred. In Nagano Prefecture, known as a model education prefecture, students were found to openly deny the national polity, and most of the faculty members are the backbone of the Communist Party. If this state continues to be tolerated, the future will inevitably lead to unimaginable consequences. The domestic economic crisis will only brew more opportunities for Communist Party activities. If domestic unrest erupts in the future, the Japanese army will inevitably suffer setbacks in Manchuria and Mongolia. Before China is Redized, Japan may be poisoned first, it is said. However, after a long period of deliberation, the Fascist Party members ultimately could not find a perfect solution, and only intensified urging the government to strictly crack down.</p>
<p>France to Build the Sahara Railway</p>
<p>A Kuomin News Agency dispatch from Paris on the 27th reported that someone in the French Parliament proposed a resolution to immediately build a railway across the Sahara Desert, emphasizing that once the road is completed, it will be able to concentrate colonial troops in a few days, which is extremely important militarily, it is said.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 27th reported that the Senate today approved the government's reduction of military spending by a vote of 180 to 118. Premier Daladier took this as a matter of confidence.</p>
<p>Japanese Nail-less Destroyer</p>
<p>A Dentsu dispatch from Sasebo on the 27th reported that the nail-less first-class destroyer "Hatsuharu" was launched at 10:00 a.m. today, with a tonnage of 1,380 tons. The joints are electrically welded, with the latest functions.</p>
<p>Major Eruption of Mount Aso in Japan</p>
<p>A Hualian dispatch from Tokyo on the 27th reported that Mount Aso in Kumamoto Prefecture, Kyushu, which had long been a dormant volcano and temporarily showed no activity, suddenly erupted on the night of the 24th of this month, greatly shaking the surrounding counties. All schools were unable to hold classes due to the shaking of houses, and residents moved to the fields to stay overnight. The Kumamoto Prefectural Police Department strictly prohibited people from climbing the mountain. The flames shot high and the rumbling sounded for dozens of miles. Oita Prefecture suffered no small disaster. The fire became more intense last night, erupting day and night, and the residents were extremely panicked. It is said that this eruption is the largest activity in 150 years.</p>
<p>Italian Artificial Silk Industry</p>
<p>A Kuomin dispatch from Rome on the 26th reported that the Italian artificial silk trust director announced today that the Italian artificial silk industry has made great progress in the past year. The biggest reason is the reduction of operating expenses. Although the output in 1932 was only 31 million kilograms, a decrease of 12% compared to the previous year, due to effective operations, the profits were higher than the previous year. Therefore, the largest viscose factory in the trust distributed a dividend of six percent last year, which is actually equal to the previous year, it is said.</p>

<p>Japan Fears No Country, Reasons for Fear</p>
<p>We Want to Win in a Long-Term War of Resistance</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Gan Jiehou, the Special Commissioner for Diplomatic Inspection in the Five Southwestern Provinces, met with newspaper reporters at the Special Commissioner's Office on the 21st, discussing the China-Japan issue in detail, which is of great importance. He stated as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e66">Predictions of Japanese Steps <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Japan has decided to oppose the report drafted by the Committee of Nineteen, threatening to withdraw from the League of Nations and has prepared to launch a major offensive against Jehol. Japan's threat to withdraw from the League of Nations is a means of intimidating the League in the hope of preventing the passage of the report at the Assembly. However, if the Assembly passes the report, Japan will be in a difficult position, and may actually withdraw from the League of Nations. As for Jehol, Japan has long regarded it as something in its pocket and will certainly try to occupy it in order to complete its plan to create a puppet state of Manchuria. The date of its capture of Jehol will certainly be before the Assembly passes the report. If so, Japan can still quibble that it has not violated Article 16 [engaging in war in violation of the provisions of Article 15] and avoid the sanctions of Article 16. If Jehol is occupied, the military force in North China will be disintegrated. Afterwards, it will not be easy to recover lost territory and resist by force. Japan will then be able to resolve the matter outside the League of Nations in order to consolidate its acquired position. However, if our country resolutely resists and the war in Jehol is prolonged, and Japan cannot achieve its goals quickly, it will try to disrupt Tianjin, Shanghai, or even blockade our country's coast in order to destroy our economic and commercial organization and reduce our strength to resist. At this time, if Britain and France or Britain and the United States can unite as they did in 1895 with Russia and Germany to demand that Japan abandon the Far East Peninsula, and resolutely give Japan a warning, demanding that it stop attacking Jehol and resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute in accordance with the League of Nations and the order, Japanese militarists, although they are crazy, will certainly not dare to be enemies with the world's powers. Their obedience is the same as what happened in 1895. However, the current international organization is extremely disorganized, and this situation is difficult to reappear today. In 1895, Russia and France were allied countries, and there was a so-called [Reinsurance Treaty] between Germany and Russia, which was similar in nature to an alliance. Although this treaty did not exist in 1895, the feelings between the German Emperor and the Russian Emperor were very deep, and they called each other by their first names in their correspondence. Therefore, when the three countries jointly warned Japan, Japan had only two paths: submission and a disastrous defeat. Now it is different. Britain, the United States, Russia, and France, which are related to the Far East, not only have no alliance treaties, but Britain and France have the issue of war debts with the United States, which hinders their cooperation. The United States and Russia have not yet established diplomatic relations. Now, if they want to sanction Japan by force, Britain and the United States are too far away from Japan with their naval bases, and the strength of their warships must be two to one to be able to win. Therefore, Britain alone against Japan, or the United States alone against Japan, their naval strength is not enough. The Soviet Union alone against Japan also has no certainty of victory. The difficulties of Russian transportation and logistical support during the Russo-Japanese War are still the same as before, and the Soviet Union can no longer send a navy equal in strength to the Japanese to help fight. Japan knows that there is no military organization among the four countries, and no one country has the power to confront Japan alone. Therefore, even after Britain and France have expressed their attitude that the League of Nations will take tough measures, they still dare to be unscrupulous, openly declare their withdrawal from the League of Nations, and launch a major offensive against Jehol. However, if Japan disrupts Tianjin and Shanghai and seals off China's ports, it will inevitably inflict a major blow on the commerce of Britain, the United States, and France. Moreover, if our country resists wherever the Japanese troops go, then all places will be disrupted immediately, and the merchants and residents of various countries will also suffer losses. At this point, it will be difficult for various countries to stand idly by, and it may promote a new international alliance and take self-defense measures.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Our Country Should Take Strategies <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Under these circumstances, in my opinion, the following strategies should be adopted: (1) Long-term resistance. After long-term resistance, the following situations can be promoted: 1. If Japan attacks Jehol and can occupy it before the Assembly passes the report, then Japan can still falsely claim that it has not violated the provisions of Article 15, Section 6, and Article 16, Section 1. However, if our country can resolutely resist, Japan will definitely not be able to occupy Jehol in a short period of time. If Japan continues to attack after the Assembly passes the report, then its crime of resisting the recommendations of the report and engaging in war with China, which accepts the report, will be fully established. The League of Nations should immediately implement the sanctions of Article 16 in accordance with the agreement, without any further delay or prevarication. 2. In 1911, the negotiations between Germany and France regarding Morocco and the Congo were on the verge of breaking down, and the war was about to break out. German debt bonds fell sharply, and people rushed to the banks to withdraw their money. The German authorities, in view of the weakness of their own economy, softened their attitude, and the war was avoided. Today, the domestic situation in Japan is similar to that in Germany. After the publication of the draft report of the Committee of Nineteen, the Japanese financial community immediately showed panic, and the stock exchange stopped operating. If Japan attacks Jehol and China can persist for several months, then Japan's economy and commerce will inevitably be chaotic. Moreover, its invasion of China is entirely handled by the General Staff Headquarters. If it wastes money and manpower and has no success for a long time, then domestic politics will inevitably change. Historical precedents are numerous. Therefore, Japan's military movement will never last long. 3. If Japan disrupts our country's commercial and economic center and seals off our ports, then at a time when unemployment is serious in Europe and the United States, the Far Eastern market will be hit suddenly, and it will be difficult for various countries to take a "sweep the snow from your own doorstep" attitude again. (2) Announce the cancellation of all treaties between China and Japan. According to international law, when two countries have an official matter, all treaties between the two countries, the implementation and interpretation of which are the direct cause of the war, will naturally be extinguished due to the war. As for commercial treaties, according to the opinions of international jurists, they can also be cancelled due to war because they have no permanent nature. After Japan passes the report at the General Assembly, it will still attack Jehol. Then the existence of a war between China and Japan is, in law, reason, and fact, beyond doubt. After the Sino-Russian War, the 1905 Sino-Japanese Conference, the Correct Agreements and Supplementary Agreements on the Affairs of the Three Eastern Provinces, the 1915 Sino-Japanese Treaty and its exchange of notes (i.e., the Twenty-One Demands), etc., are all the starting point of the dispute between China and Japan over the rights and interests in the Three Eastern Provinces, and their implementation and interpretation are the direct cause of this war. Our government should immediately announce the cancellation of the 1896 Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the 1903 Sino-Japanese Supplementary Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. (3) Demand that the League of Nations implement two kinds of sanctions: 1. Since Japan has violated Article 5 of the Covenant, all member states should immediately cut off all economic, commercial, and transportation ties with Japan in accordance with the agreement. 2. According to Article 16, Section 2, the Council of the League of Nations has the responsibility to dispatch naval, land, and air forces to the member states to guarantee the Covenant. Our country's representative should request the Council to designate Britain and France to dispatch sufficient naval and air forces to fight together with our country's troops against the violent Japan. China's resistance is initially to preserve its territory, but after the implementation of Article 16, it is fighting to protect the alliance. Whether the sanctions against Japan and the protection of the alliance can be effective depends on Britain. Britain has the strongest naval power among the member states, and the sanctions against Japan must be carried out by the navy. Moreover, Britain's position is the most secure, and there is no need to worry about the rear when the navy sets out. If Britain is determined, the United States can follow closely. I still remember that in 1914, when German troops invaded Belgium, Britain, as one of the countries guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality, the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George explained the reasons for participating in the European War, saying that [our country has a serious responsibility to guarantee] Belgium's independence, freedom, and integrity. Belgium is a weak country and cannot force our country to fulfill this responsibility, but if a person seeks to default on a debt because the creditor is unable to force him to repay it, it is the height of shamelessness. Today, Britain's responsibility to China is even more serious than to Belgium. Britain should not only guarantee the Covenant, but also, as one of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty, has the responsibility to guarantee China's territorial integrity. 3. Japan resists the report and threatens to withdraw from the League of Nations as a means of coercion, while on the other hand, it is strongly arguing that if it withdraws from the League of Nations, the German islands in the Pacific Ocean entrusted to it by the League of Nations for governance can still be preserved. Then the Covenant of the League of Nations can be trampled on at will, while the benefits granted by the League of Nations must be enjoyed forever. How can there be such an unfair thing in the world? Our country's representative should, after the entry and passage of the report, request the Council to vote to cancel Japan's membership in the League of Nations in accordance with Article 16, Section 4. Once its membership is cancelled, the German islands entrusted to it by the League of Nations will naturally be recovered. If Japan knows that Jehol may not be obtained, and the German islands may be lost, and the economic and military sanctions will eventually be implemented due to the gradual consensus of the various countries, then its change of attitude and acceptance of the report may not be unexpected. All of this depends on how the League of Nations uses its strength to save this crisis.</p>

<p>Deadline for Eliminating Bandit Gangs</p>
<p>The Army Will Be Able to Go North Soon</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since Chairman Chiang came to Jiangxi to command the suppression of bandits, he has also been planning and considering military affairs against Japan. Although military affairs in North China are currently presided over by Zhang Xueliang, Zhang reports the important matters to Chairman Chiang for instructions, and Chiang decides and sends telegrams at any time. Recently, such as Zhang Qun, Huang Shaohong, and Huang Shaogu, the representative of Feng Yuxiang, came to Jiangxi one after another, either to discuss important political affairs with the central government or to ask for military instructions, all of which are related to the great plan of resisting Japan. According to a senior military officer of the headquarters yesterday, the current bandit suppression force in Jiangxi has reached more than 200,000, and together with those who are suppressing bandits in neighboring provinces, there are about 300,000 people. Chairman Chiang is currently rushing to eliminate the bandits in order to move the army north. Therefore, he has set a deadline to eliminate the bandits and appointed Chen Jitang as the deputy commander of bandit suppression, and Cai Tingkai, Chen Cheng, and Yu Hanmou as the commanders of the left, middle, and right routes, with Ruijin as the meeting point. Chen Cheng went to Fu from the province on the 22nd, and will launch a general offensive on Zhu Mao from Jinxi, Zixi, and Nancheng to Lichuan. (25th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Zhanglong Railway Construction Plan <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Construction Cost of Approximately 6 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese to Undertake Two-Thirds</p>
<p>Fuzhou News: Last autumn, the General Headquarters of the 19th Route Army specially sent Zou Minchu to various places in Southeast Asia and Britain to express gratitude to the overseas Chinese for their donations to the Shanghai war and to discuss the construction of the Tinglong Zhangxia Railway in order to develop the local economy in western Fujian. It was greatly supported by the overseas Chinese. Recently, Zou came to the province from Zhang with Cai Tingkai to discuss road construction methods with Provincial Government Chairman Jiang Guangnai. According to his plan: (1) The route: First build the section from Zhangzhou to Longyan, starting from Jiangdong Bridge in Zhangzhou, going upstream along the Beixi River, and reaching the county seat of Longyan. Because there are streams and rivers that can be used for traffic, the slope is very small, and it is easier to lay railway tracks. (2) The project: The entire road is about 120 kilometers long. According to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway method, each kilometer requires 300 yuan, and the entire amount is about 3.6 million yuan. If the Beixi section is mountainous, the laying of the track is more difficult and requires an additional 2.4 million yuan, making a total of 6 million yuan, which is more than enough. (3) The railway track: The standard distance of ordinary railway tracks is 4 meters and 8.5 inches. If the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is followed and railway tracks weighing 35 pounds are used, the cost can be saved by three-quarters compared to ordinary 80-pound railway tracks. (4) Funds: Two-thirds of the funds will be undertaken by overseas Chinese, raising 4 million yuan in commercial shares. The government will undertake one-third, allocating 200,000 pounds from the British Boxer Indemnity as official shares. The provincial government has now compiled a plan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review. Zou will temporarily return to Hong Kong to take care of personal matters and will come to Fujian to prepare for the project once it is approved. February 23rd)</p>

<p>Assisting the Government in Preparing for National Defense</p>
<p>Actively Raising National Salvation Funds</p>
<p>The Education Community Donates One Million First</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: Since the September 18th Incident, the masses of Han Province have been extremely grieved and indignant. For more than a year, all sectors of society have been boycotting enemy goods and donating money to comfort the Northeast Volunteer Army, and have worked very hard. Recently, the Mass National Salvation Association was reorganized, and representatives from all walks of life held a preparatory meeting at the provincial party headquarters, and elected Zhou Xingfu, Hu Ying, Miao Yuntai, Yang Jinghan, and other 20 people as preparatory committee members. Subsequently, the preparatory meeting decided to hold a provincial mass representative assembly at the Provincial Guidance Committee on the 8th of this month to elect executive and supervisory committee members and formally establish the Yunnan Mass National Salvation Association, concentrating the manpower and financial resources of the entire province to assist the government in preparing for national defense and resisting foreign aggression. At 1:00 p.m. that day, more than 200 representatives from various agencies, groups, schools, and military and political circles arrived, chaired by Zhou Xingfu, who delivered the opening remarks, stating the seriousness of the national crisis and the need for the masses of the province to rise up together to save the country. Then Hu Ying delivered a speech and read out the organizational outline of the Yunnan Mass National Salvation Association, with the Mass Representative Assembly as the highest organ, and established the following associations and offices: (A) Executive Committee, with seven to eleven standing committee members elected from among the executive committee members to form a standing committee, under which there are five offices for fundraising, training, custody, design, and secretariat, each with one director and deputy director and several committee members, elected or appointed by the executive committee. Each office is divided into several sections according to the complexity of the affairs. (B) Supervisory Committee, with three to five standing committee members elected from among the supervisory committee members. After Hu read out the outline, the assembly discussed it item by item, and the representatives expressed their opinions one after another, and their words were all impassioned and enthusiastic. The executive and supervisory committee members were immediately elected, including Zhou Xingfu, Hu Yunshan, Zhu Xiaodong, Miao Yuntai, Gong Zhongjun, Lu Zian, Zhang Xilin (all provincial committees), Chen Xiushan, Yang Jinghan (provincial party guidance committee), Jin Handing, Yang Ruxuan, Ma Zixiang (military circles), Chen Fuguang, Xu Jizu, Zhou Lizhai (education circles), Li Xiping, Lu Minggao, Zhou Shouzheng (business circles), Wang Hansheng, Deng Zhibin (press circles), Li Xianting, Shen Shuqiu (gentry elders), and other 70 people were elected as executive committee members, and Li Yinchuan, Chen Xingfu, You Kuiping, Ma Boan, and other 17 people were elected as supervisory committee members. Finally, Hu Yunshan delivered a speech, expressing his sincere views on issues such as resisting Japan, defending against foreign aggression, consolidating national defense, and raising donations, and announced that Li Renfu of the press had first donated 1,000 yuan for national salvation expenses, and then the meeting was adjourned for photography.</p>
<p>At 7:00 p.m. on the 9th, the Mass National Salvation Association held its first joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the provincial party headquarters, attended by 47 executive and supervisory committee members, including Zhou Xingfu. The chairman introduced and elected Hu Yunshan, Lu Yongheng, Li Yinchuan, Chen Xingfu, and others as standing committee members of the executive and supervisory committees, as well as the directors of each office. Then, they discussed the methods of raising national salvation funds. The members expressed their opinions one after another, and generally advocated raising 10 million yuan in Yunnan currency. The allocation method followed the precedents of Shanghai and Guangdong, with airplanes as the unit, and each industry, sector, and region should bear the burden of several airplanes according to their ability. Some advocated issuing aviation lottery tickets as proposed by Song Ziwen, and some advocated focusing on property donations and asking the wealthy to donate first. As a result, the opinions of the members were recorded and handed over to the fundraising and design offices for reference, so as to formulate a concrete plan and submit it to the next joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for discussion. The association has been holding standing committee meetings for days to discuss the progress of the work.</p>
<p>The Yunnan education community voluntarily recognized and purchased 1 million yuan in national salvation funds. Yesterday, the education department held a joint consultation meeting on expenses and has resolved the allocation method: (1) 300,000 yuan will be recognized and donated from the local education expenses of each county. (2) 500,000 yuan will be recognized and donated from the provincial education expenses. (3) 200,000 yuan will be recognized and donated by students throughout the province. The money will be used to purchase airplanes and will be named Yunnan Student. Regarding items 1 and 2, the money must be recognized within three months. (February 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Hunan Provincial Government Requests the Ministry to Continue Levying Salt Business Tax <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>To Prevent Loss of Provincial and Local Tax Revenue</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Hunan Provincial Government yesterday sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance regarding the salt business tax, requesting that it continue to be handled according to the current method. The text is as follows: [According to the case presented by the Department of Finance, based on the Ministry's Salt Department Order No. 5189], the Shaoyang Urban Salt Industry Association of Hunan submitted a request to exempt the special salt industry from the business tax. The instruction was to immediately exempt the tax in accordance with the case to unify the policy. This was forwarded to the government for review. After reviewing the measures for levying and exempting salt business tax, the Ministry clearly stipulated in the five-item explanation of the business tax measures that since salt is related to the people's food, it is not desirable to repeatedly levy taxes on its trade like other commodities, which may affect the price of salt. The original plan already levied salt tax centrally for the specially operated salt industry and separately levied or exempted taxes for those selling miscellaneous goods and retail salt, which truly maintained the people's livelihood while also considering tax revenue. According to the salt sales situation in Hunan, the so-called "specially operated businesses that have already had salt tax levied by the central government" only apply to transporters who transport various salt permits from Sichuan, Guangdong, and Huai. As for water peddlers, their main business is selling retail salt, so they should be subject to taxation. The Hunan provincial salt business tax collection methods, except for transporters who are exempt in accordance with the case, also thoroughly investigate and exempt water peddlers who operate salt businesses but do not retail, making the handling very lenient. Last June, a large document was suddenly approved, stating that the aforementioned explanation of salt industry measures refers to exempting all salt businesses, whether wholesale, retail, or both, from business tax if they have already had salt tax levied by the central government. This is significantly different from the Ministry's original order and explanation of measures. If merchants operate salt businesses that only wholesale and do not retail, the business tax could still be collected from retail merchants. Therefore, the tax for those specialized in salt operations can be leniently exempted. However, if specialized salt businesses engaged in both wholesale and retail are uniformly exempted, not only will specialized salt operators be able to refuse to pay under this pretext, but even stores that sell miscellaneous goods and also retail salt can change their signs and add a note stating that they are specialized in order to seek exemption. In the future, the entire province's salt business tax will inevitably have no income, merely opening a door for merchants to take advantage of, causing this unnecessary loss to local tax revenue. Moreover, the business tax is a direct tax that should be directly paid by the business operators. The regular and additional salt taxes currently paid by business merchants are still passed on to consumers, so these merchants bear no burden whatsoever. How can one use the term "tax on tax" as an excuse? Now, all types of businesses are paying taxes in accordance with regulations, but the salt industry alone is granted exemption, and stores that also sell retail salt are uniquely able to avoid taxation. Judging by legal principles, this is obviously unfair. The collection of salt business tax in Hunan has historically been carried out by the Department of Finance in accordance with the provisions of the second item of the five-item measures issued by the Ministry. Whenever there were cases of merchants in the specialized salt industry citing the case to seek exemption, the department ordered the tax collection agencies of that industry to investigate whether the merchant was also engaged in retail, and levied or exempted taxes accordingly. Collection has been carried out for a long time. Now that the Shaoyang salt merchants' request for exemption has been approved by the Ministry, salt merchants in all counties will inevitably follow suit and demand exemption, mutually refusing to pay taxes. The future of tax revenue is not insignificant. It is requested that you consider that the Hunan provincial salt business tax collection methods do not conflict with the Ministry's case, do not hinder national tax revenue and the people's food, and have been followed for a long time without merchant resistance. All the aforementioned salt business tax should be handled in accordance with the current method. In addition to exempting specialized salt businesses that do not retail, stores that trade in retail salt, regardless of whether they are specialized in the salt business, should still be taxed in accordance with regulations. If any merchants continue to request exemption, please reject them in response to maintain tax policy. To uphold public interest, this document is respectfully submitted to the Ministry for your review.]</p>

<p>Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway</p>
<p>Adding a Jingjiang Branch Line</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, from the Jiangbian in Xixing, Hangzhou to Lanxi, has been in operation for some time, and passenger and freight transportation has been progressing daily. In January of this year, business income reached 120,000 yuan, the number of passengers reached 100,000, and the tonnage of goods was also 5,000 tons. The business is very developed. However, the starting point of the road is at the Jiangbian in Xixing, across the Qiantang River from Hangzhou. Because both sides of the Qiantang River have accumulated sand, cargo ships cannot dock, and the development of cargo transportation is difficult. The road is now actively solving the Qiantang River crossing problem and has chosen a location opposite the Zhakou station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line to build a branch line, which is six kilometers long from the Xixing Jiangbian station to that location. In order to commemorate former Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Zhang, it is named Jingjiang Station. The branch road was completed on February 15 and is scheduled to begin operations.</p>

<p>Xiong Xiling Uses Belgium in the European War as Encouragement</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association held its fifth board meeting at the Zhongshe at 4 p.m. yesterday, and welcomed Mr. Bing San. More than 20 people, including Xiong Xiling, Chu Fucheng, Xu Shiying, Feng Shaoshan, Yin Zhufu, Yan Zhifang, Wu Shan, Mu Ouchu, and Yin Zhiling, were present. Chu Fucheng chaired the meeting. During the meeting, Xiong reported on the situation of the Volunteer Army in the Northeast and the urgent need for relief supplies in Rehe, and passed several motions, including a cable requesting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go north to supervise the troops. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>First, Chairman Chu Fucheng delivered a welcome speech,</p>
<p>Briefly stating that after the September 18th Incident, Zhang Xueliang, the general in charge of the Northeast, held a policy of non-resistance, and Tang Yulin, the chairman of Rehe, also had an unclear attitude. Today, they can both clearly express their resistance to Japan, which is due to the efforts of Mr. Tai Bing San in the north for more than a year. In April of last year, Mr. Xiong personally went to Rehe, and Tang began to change his attitude, and the Volunteer Army was able to obtain considerable assistance and supplies in Rehe and establish contact with the interior. His contribution is particularly great. Now that Mr. Xiong has come south to contact people in Shanghai to assist the soldiers fighting against Japan in North China, the colleagues not only express their admiration and welcome, but also ask to be instructed on how we can work hard, he said.</p>
<p>Xiong's Report</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling then stood up and spoke, saying that the reason why our country is able to achieve diplomatic and moral victories in the League of Nations is due to the efforts of the Volunteer Army. The Japanese once declared internationally that they would be able to clear up the internal disturbances in the three northeastern provinces in five months, but in fact, even after a year and a half, they have not been able to stabilize the situation, making the international community clearly aware that the [Manchukuo] is resolutely opposed by the people. The reason why the Volunteer Army has been able to persist for so long is due to the continuous supply from the Support Association. He then described the situation of the Volunteer Army in Liaonan and Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, saying that although the troops of Su, Ma, Li, Wang, and others have retreated into Russian territory, there are still more than 200,000 civilian volunteer soldiers who have close cooperation with the people and cannot be eliminated by the Japanese. As for the situation in Rehe and North China, our strength is very strong, and the morale is very high. The soldiers once said to those who came to offer condolences, "We have no other demands, except for the order to fight." At present, the urgent need for supplies in Rehe is road construction, food, bullets, and automobiles. The spiritual encouragement and the supply and replenishment of military personnel are also very important. After the European War, the famous French general Foch said that the reason why France was able to win was first due to the construction of roads, second to the efforts of factory workers in supplying equipment, third to the ability of women to replace men in doing work, and finally to the efforts of the soldiers. This statement can be used as a mirror. If our country can unite and bravely resist, it will be at most like Belgium in the European War, suffering heavy losses and destruction, but it will never be subjugated.</p>
<p>Xu's Report</p>
<p>After Xiong's report, Xu Shiying stood up and reported on the relief efforts of the Northeastern Refugee Relief Association, hoping to make a comprehensive plan to maintain the food supply in Rehe in the shortest possible time. Then, the motions were discussed and passed: (1) A cable was sent to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, requesting him to go north to supervise the troops as soon as possible in order to unify command and boost morale. (2) Xiong Xiling and Chu Fucheng were publicly elected as representatives to visit He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, to urge the determination of the North China military plan. (3) Wu Shan, Chen Peide, Feng Shaoshan, Yin Zhiling, Hu Fengxiang, and Shen Zuru were sent to contact various organizations in the city to jointly cable Zhang Xueliang to resolutely resist the war and other association affairs, and then the meeting dispersed.</p>
<p>Please Chiang to Supervise the Troops</p>
<p>To Chairman Chiang, Nanchang: The Japanese bandits are using their national strength to occupy Rehe, and our country is deeply afraid of this campaign, which is related to the survival of the nation. The troops of all roads are loyal, brave, and enthusiastic, and have gathered to provide assistance. The loyal and righteous people of the Northeast have risen up in the countryside and organized a volunteer army to kill the enemy. The morale is very reliable. However, according to recent reports, Chaoyang and other front lines are already in danger. It is said that the reason is that military orders cannot be unified. Only if you personally go north to supervise the troops and unify command can you boost the morale of the front and save the overall situation from danger. Moreover, since the Shenyang Incident, the government has not dispatched a single division due to the overall plan, and the common people in the countryside are quite disappointed. Recently, since Dean Song went to Rehe to inspect, the military and civilian morale in North China has been greatly boosted. You hold the general hub of military affairs and are looked up to by the people. If you personally lead the troops, the morale will be even more inspired, not only comforting the hopes of the people in the north, but also strengthening the nation's determination to resist the enemy. As for the jumping beam bandits in Jiangxi, they have gradually been suppressed. Even if there are remnants of bandits, a partial division can be used to suppress them, which is sufficient to deal with the situation. There is no greater disaster than the Japanese bandits. It is hoped that you will weigh the importance, turn your troops north, to destroy the enemy and recover the lost land. The rise and fall of China depends on you alone. Please consider this carefully. The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, bowing, feeling.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Yu Rizhang's Letter Describes American Sympathy for Our Country <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Hoping that Our Country Will Strive on Its Own</p>
<p>Since the League of Nations' attitude towards Japan has changed, people in Britain and the United States, seeing our country's resistance to violent Japan, have expressed deep sympathy and hope that we can strive on our own to recover the lost land. As evidenced by Dr. Yu Rizhang, who has traveled to Europe and the United States, in a letter from Washington to his Shanghai friend Mr. Wang: (The first part is omitted) Rizhang has been in the United States for two months. During these two months, he has discussed the Sino-Japanese issue with people in New York and Washington and has gained many opinions. Here are a few of the most important points for my colleagues to briefly present. Since the United States is a major signatory of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it cannot stand idly by and do nothing about Japan's violations of the treaty in the Far East. Japan also voluntarily signed this treaty, but now it is ignoring everything and openly destroying it. Therefore, in order to maintain this treaty, the United States must come forward and advocate for something. But to what extent can the United States advocate? This is worth considering. According to our observations, although the United States sympathizes with China, its steps towards Japan cannot exceed the policy clearly defined by Stimson. In other words, the United States should deny any agreement or development that violates the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Open Door Policy. Based on this point, the puppet [Manchukuo] created by the Japanese is also among those denied. Japan is well aware of the world situation and has repeatedly stated to the world that it has no intention of aggression. But in reality, Japan is still invading China and its complete territory. In the current world, no major power can thwart the aggressive will and actions of the Japanese military, unless Japan's economic situation falls into bankruptcy and cannot be saved. In this situation, what practical steps should China take to cope with it? This is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. The following points may have some contribution: (1) The Chinese government and people should make the strongest possible resistance to further aggression by the Japanese. (2) The Chinese government and people should do their best to recover the lost land through their own struggles in the shortest possible time. (3) The Chinese government should avoid officially declaring war on Japan at this time. (4) The Chinese people (not the Chinese government and the Kuomintang) should continue to support the Northeast Volunteer Army and intensify the national boycott movement. (5) The Chinese government should immediately unify the country and transform it. Influential public opinion here believes that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia is a reasonable move, but after the resumption of diplomatic relations, China must proceed with caution and should not rely too much on Russia. According to the principle of [Heaven helps those who help themselves], not only should individuals obtain the most reliable assistance from their own efforts, but also a social country should strive to save themselves and others. We deeply hope that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia will not only maintain the mutual friendship between the two countries but also further contribute to peace in the Far East and the world. The national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. I hope that patriotic compatriots will rise up and seek a solution. (The following is omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Important Declaration by More Than Sixty Labor Unions <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Every Thread and Grain Must Be Used to Support the Country</p>
<p>Every Moment Should Be Dedicated to Working</p>
<p>Dagongshe says that more than 60 labor unions in the city, in view of the start of the war and the seriousness of the national crisis, yesterday jointly issued an important declaration: A public statement to compatriots across the country: Since the Shenyang Incident, the three provinces have surrendered the border areas to the enemy without resistance. There has never been a greater national humiliation than this. After mourning, the people of the country encouraged each other to help each other. On the one hand, they used the method of economic severance to inflict fatal stabs on violent Japan. Although it has not hit the mark, it can be asserted that if the people of the country persist in this, the enemy will eventually fall. On the other hand, they supervised and urged the government to send troops to negotiate. The people's hearts have not died. There is still a day to rise up and restore the country after fighting to the death. If they die without fighting, the descendants of the people of the country will be slaves for generations. Now that Shanhaiguan has been lost, the enemy's flames have spread, and the alarm bells of Rehe are ringing frequently. The enemy has used its national army to try to invade and occupy Rehe. This has long been expected by the people of the country and did not happen by chance. The government, in view of the failure of non-resistance in the past, has concentrated its efforts to vow to defend the country. Minister Song also made a trip to Chengde. Morale has been stimulated, and the people's hearts have been inspired as never before. The enemy's desires are difficult to satisfy, and the people of the country are at the final juncture of life and death, which depends on whether the people of the country can rise up and rescue themselves. Fellow compatriots across the country, we speak of national crisis every day, but the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious. We supervise and urge the government to resist, and the government is now determined to defend Rehe to the death. The long-standing depression will be swept away by this. However, our heavy burden will also become heavier. At this time, in addition to doing our best and using our wisdom to support the government and be the government's backing, we should also unite the people of the country into one big group on the same front, taking the greatest premise of going to the national crisis together. We must save on food and clothing, and work hard to produce. Every thread and grain must be used to support the country, and the soldiers on the battlefield should dedicate every moment of their spare time to practical work. If everyone in the country, old and young, does this, the national affairs will be achievable. In the past, the three households of Chu perished Qin. Now, how can 400 million compatriots be willing to submit to the iron hooves of the Japanese? We must unite with one heart and one mind, share the difficulties, and then be able to drive the violent bandits out of the national territory. Fellow compatriots across the country, the national affairs are urgent. Rehe is as dangerous as a pile of eggs. If the people of the country still have the idea of saving the country, they will enthusiastically donate their wealth and strength to save Rehe today. Our association and others vow to lead the 800,000 workers in Shanghai to work together with the people of the country.

<h3 id="e77">Current Situation in Various Ports During the War <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese are调动Ships to Transport Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Attempt to Block Dagu Estuary</p>
<p>Ships are Being调动ed to Transport Japanese侨民Since the outbreak of the war in Rehe, the Japanese have also had military intentions in North China. The Tianjin Maru of the Dalian Steamboat Association in this city has been调动ed to Tianjin to load the local Japanese overseas Chinese and retreat to Dalian. Yesterday, the company also continued to调动 the Changping Maru and other ships traveling in North China, ordering them to go to Qinhuangdao to load the Japanese overseas Chinese who were withdrawing from the area and transport them to Dalian Bay. Therefore, within the North China route of the Dalian Steamship Association, routes such as Yantai Line, Qingdao Line, Yingkou Line, Andong Line, and Tianjin Line have all been suspended for commercial flights and are exclusively used by the country's authorities to调动 and transport Japanese overseas Chinese and for military transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Yangtze River Goods are Still Being Transported <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>In the Yangtze River area, the Japanese商trade is still being operated. The Japanese merchant ships transporting goods to the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are still loading as usual on the Jianglun vessels of the Nissin Company. The transportation of iron sand from Wuxue's Digang to the East has recently been intensified. A large number of inferior goods purchased from various ports along the Yangtze River, loaded on the Mikasa Maru ship that arrived in Shanghai yesterday, will be转到ed to Hankou tomorrow. However, the ports of Yichang, Shashi, Chongqing, and Changsha, etc., have had Japanese warships increased since the 26th by Commander Banno.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Preventing the Blockade of Dagu <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Naval authorities now have the intention of假警備Chinese coastal ports, and are增派ing two naval teams to South China and North China, in effect blocking the Dagu Estuary. They are currently趕運ing Japanese overseas Chinese from various ports in the north and south. Once the overseas Chinese have been evacuated, they will implement this plan. According to what those who came to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday said, the people of Tianjin also逆知the danger in North China, which may be unavoidable, but the people's hearts are united in their determination to resist. Therefore, they have recently become more calm and few people have moved south. Therefore, the Fangsheng, a ship on the Jardine Matheson North China route, arrived in Shanghai yesterday with only seven passengers from Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e80">South Seas Mail Rate Increase Proposal: Various Parties Telegraph for Delay <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Overseas United Association Will Send Representatives to Petition in the Capital</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident and the impact of gold prices, postal revenue has suffered significant losses. Therefore, the Postal Administration plans to increase the rate for each letter sent to the South Seas through the Fujian-Guangdong private postal system by 12.5 cents. After this news was reported, overseas Chinese in the South Seas were shocked and telegraphed to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese United Association, appealing to the government to consider the hardships of overseas Chinese and postpone the rate increase to alleviate their difficulties. The Overseas Chinese United Association attaches great importance to this case and believes that overseas Chinese are currently enthusiastically donating funds to save the country, sacrificing their homes to overcome difficulties. The government's sudden move to increase postage rates would only cause the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to save the country to drop to zero, which is truly regrettable. It is planned to send staff to Beijing within a few days to visit the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Communications to petition. The following is a copy of the telegram from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the Chinese Overseas United Association: "To the Shanghai Overseas Chinese United Association, upon reading the report that the government plans to increase postage rates for South Seas mail, we are deeply concerned. We believe that increasing postage will only increase the burden on overseas Chinese. If it is difficult to remit funds, it will be difficult to support family members. Who will support the livelihoods of overseas Chinese families? Our association has already telegraphed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Communications, requesting them to consider the difficulties of overseas Chinese and approve a postponement. We believe that your association, as the central hub for overseas Chinese around the world, will spare no effort to serve the interests of overseas Chinese. There are precedents, which have been deeply believed by the overseas Chinese community. Therefore, we dare to ask your association to appeal on our behalf and provide strong assistance. We are extremely grateful." - Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>To Strengthen the Determination of Soldiers to Fight to the Death</p>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan believes that the battalion commander An Dexin, Guan Jingquan, Wang Hongyuan, Liu Yuchen, and other company commanders who bravely fought against the enemy and died heroically are worthy of praise, and the whole country mourns them. Yesterday, he telegraphed the Shanghai Patriotic Martyrs' Families Support Association, requesting it to actively raise funds and settle the families of the martyrs in accordance with Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the association's fourth regulation to comfort their souls. The following is an excerpt of his telegram: [To the Shanghai Patriotic Martyrs' Families Support Association, the violent Japanese invaded, and fierce battles took place at Yuguan. Brigade Commander He Zhuguo led his troops to bravely resist the enemy. The officers and soldiers shared the same determination, resulting in the battalion commander An Dexin, company commanders Guan Jingquan, Wang Hongyuan, Jun Yuchen, and others dying on the same day. The dead are loyal and heroic, and the whole country mourns. Battalion Commander An left behind an elderly mother, a young wife, and three children, all of whom are very young. Company Commander Guan's parents are still alive, with his elderly father being over seventy years old. His wife has two daughters. Company Commander Wang's parents are both in his hometown in Shandong, and his wife gave birth to a daughter just a few months ago. Company Commander Liu's wife is weak and sickly, and he left behind four young children. All of their families are impoverished and helpless. It is deeply distressing. After checking, Battalion Commander An belongs to the National Army and should receive a pension according to the central government's regulations. However, the current living conditions of his family are indeed difficult. The association has been providing a monthly relief fund of 20 dollars to the families of Guan, Liu, and Wang, and has sent Guan's eldest daughter to the Beiping Orphanage for education to show our condolences. Battalion Commander An and others swore to defend their position to the death. The educational obligations of all the families are consistent with Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the fourth regulation of your association's support methods. I hope that you will show your patriotic spirit, actively raise funds, and settle the families to comfort the souls of the martyrs. Currently, the border is alarming, and a major war is imminent. If the families of Battalion Commander An and others are properly comforted, it will serve as an encouragement. Combining the financial resources of the entire nation as a backing, regaining the lost morale of the country, and strengthening the determination of soldiers to fight to the death will greatly benefit strategic morale. I am sincerely looking forward to it. Zhu Qinglan.]</p>
<h3 id="e84">League of Nations Engineering Expert Pudtli's Report on Inspecting the Shanghai Commercial Port <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Content is Divided into Fifteen Points</p>
<p>The League of Nations previously sent several engineering experts to China. Accompanied by personnel from the National Economic Council, they came to Shanghai to inspect the Shanghai Commercial Port. Now, the engineering expert Pudtli has submitted the report on the Shanghai Commercial Port from the engineering experts to the National Economic Council, which immediately transcribed the original text and forwarded a copy to the Shanghai Municipal Government. The Municipal Government translated the report yesterday and sent it to the Public Works Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau for reference. The following is a translation of the original text:</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal for the construction of a commercial port in Greater Shanghai, we have conducted an inspection and held detailed discussions with the responsible authorities. (1) This proposal includes the construction of a deep-water dock on the left bank of the Huangpu River upstream from the Wusong Estuary, and the construction of a wharf near Xincheng downstream of the Hongkou River for postal and passenger ships to dock. (2) Considering the current slow water flow and dense ship traffic, the Huangpu River is not suitable for ships to travel to the port. When building the dock in the future, we believe that it is necessary to organize the applicable riverbank in advance and carefully select the entrance to avoid navigation difficulties. Sediment accumulation in the river is also unfavorable because the water surface is too narrow. When building the wharf, dredging costs will be incurred, and annual dredging will also be costly. To avoid this disadvantage, sealing the entrance is the only method, but this will further hinder ship navigation. This plan is extremely difficult to implement. (3) Regarding the Wusong port construction plan, we believe that the current concave surface of the riverbank is sufficient to hinder the safety and convenience of the port entrance. The port is also sufficient to hinder the tide and make the river water surge in the nearby area. Fortunately, facing other suitable directions, there is still a greater possibility of increasing the convenience of the wharf. (4) We believe that organizing the Wusong River bank is a matter of urgency in commerce. The left bank of the river, upstream and downstream of the new city, should also be fully organized. The most important step is to adopt the opinions of the Engineering Expert Advisory Committee in 1921 and modify them according to the changing situation. (5) The construction of the postal and passenger ship wharf (the 1921 committee originally proposed construction in Wusong, but it is now proposed to be rebuilt) downstream of the Hongkou River estuary, as proposed by the municipal authorities, will bring the postal city closer. (6) To avoid hindering the existing water and electricity engineering construction, the 1921 committee moved the wharf upstream opposite the high tower. This modification shortened the length of the wharf along the edge and increased the angle of the entrance, but both are not too large. (7) Since the postal and passenger ship wharf is not being built in Wusong, the riverbank upstream and downstream of the Wusong River can be organized for the berthing of ordinary cargo. (8) We believe that it is an urgent matter to reserve a considerable area for the future construction of the wharf. After the ordinary cargo berthing area, an area of 300 meters wide must be reserved. The area behind the passenger embarkation and disembarkation wharf can be slightly reduced. These spare areas can be used for transportation sheds, warehouses, roads, and trackways. Reserving a considerable width in the stacking yards and small boat channels near the wharf is in line with the industrial plan. (9) Although the municipal plan on the east bank of the river must be slightly changed after adopting our plan, the construction of a commercial port is the central issue, and the municipal plan must first consider this before proceeding. (10) If a port construction plan is made on the right side of the river, there must be sufficient railway and road traffic. We believe that the required bridge over the river should be located in Longhua. However, considering the current dense ship traffic on the Huangpu River, there is no gap to build a bridge downstream of the estuary to cross the Huangpu. Even at the bridge site, a swing bridge must be built for ships to pass through. (11) We have seen the outline of the proposed port-style wharf construction plan in Pudong. Although we cannot express our agreement, we believe that the area adjacent to the Public Concession can still be adopted for the expansion of the wharf. (12) We strongly oppose the proposal to open a canal upstream and downstream of the sharp corner of Pudong. This canal will definitely affect the current state of the Huangpu River. Unless its entrance is tightly closed, there is no good way, but this is enough to make the ships coming and going feel deeply inconvenient. (13) Downstream of the sharp corner, the envisioned port must open one or more entrance positions, which should be carefully selected. In the future, it must be increased at any time downstream. Before the convenient construction of the wharf, it is proposed to reserve a considerable area for various expansions. This can also be done here. Our intention is that the port and urban plans must proceed consistently. (14) We have seen the proposal to build bridge over the river in Pudong and opposite the Bund in two or three places. Regarding the convenience of traffic on both sides of the river, we have proposed building a bridge in Longhua, which will replace the ferry and wait for the future application of the tunnel before making other proposals. (15) Future situations will change with time, and we cannot plan the various plans for port construction to what extent in one hour. However, everything proposed must be carried out in parallel with the works of the Dredging Bureau, which is undoubtedly the case.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Hosted Consuls Yesterday to Discuss Compensation for Disaster Areas <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>More Than Thirty People, Including British and American Commercial Counselors, Attended.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, has repeatedly invited consuls from various countries and leaders of cutting-edge business insurance companies to discuss solutions to the issue of compensation for disaster areas in Zhabei. The previous two times were unsuccessful due to heavy snow and prior engagements of the consuls. Yesterday, Mr. Wang made a third invitation. Starting around 6:00 PM, those who arrived included American Commercial Counselor An Nad, British Consul Representative British Commercial Counselor Bai Han, British Chamber of Commerce President Mai Xiu, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Fire Insurance Association Fang Jiaobo, Wang Xianhua, Chen Songyuan, Lao Jingxiu, Pei Yunqing, Zhu Wenqi, and others, totaling more than thirty people. After taking their seats, Chairman Wang Xiaolai began to speak, briefly outlining the difficult situation of the insured and requesting the foreign merchants to sincerely discuss the issue of fire insurance compensation in Zhabei. The foreign side stated that no one from the foreign merchant fire insurance industry attended, so no decision could be made. The British side consistently cited the articles of association and had no room for negotiation. Therefore, although there was a meeting, no results were achieved.</p>

On the afternoon of the 25th of this month, a regular meeting of representatives of member banks of the committee was held. The executive committee reported on the business situation for the year 21, and the general meeting re-elected the second executive committee. A reporter from New Sound visited the association yesterday and obtained the following report and a list of elected members. He also received a face-to-face statement from manager Zhu Boquan regarding the recent situation of the clearing house. They are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Business Report <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Business Report for the Year 21</p>
<p>The establishment of our association was right after the January 28th Shanghai Incident. In recent years, Chinese commercial banks have sprung up, with total deposits reaching 1.8 billion yuan. We have always kept in mind the ancient teaching of being prepared for danger in times of peace and have studied the regulations of advanced countries. The need for public reserves did not begin today, but the invasion of a strong enemy prompted our unity. Adversity inspires wisdom, and difficulties invigorate the nation. Our association is just one example of this. On the second day of the Shanghai Incident, the entire market closed, and the situation was serious. The silver and money industry conference believed that if our industry stopped for a long time, panic would increase. On February 4, despite Japanese aircraft, we resolutely resumed business. On that day, the foreign exchange rate was 74 cents, and the silver discount rate was 7 cents. The source was suddenly blocked, and the destination was frequent. People were alarmed and could not rest easy. Securities and real estate, which were most valuable in normal times, almost completely lost their effectiveness for a while. Our colleagues calmly responded to the business on one hand, and gathered in the morning and evening to discuss the establishment of our association on the other hand. In the selection of assets, we strived for the best. In the estimation of value, we took strict measures. In addition, experts were hired, methods of custody were adopted, and the issuance of certificates, the handling of discounts, and the articles of the convention were discussed in a few days. The organization was established on February 8. In general psychology, knowing that our industry cooperated and that not only 40 million assets were quickly established, but also that the effectiveness of public certificates was sufficient to replace cash, it was no different from a sudden increase of several million silver dollars in the Shanghai market. The news spread, and people's hearts gradually calmed down. After the end of the war and the recovery of the market on March 15, our association officially opened. Chinese and foreign public opinion was unanimous. Since then, the war ended, and the market recovered. As of the end of the year, there were no discount businesses. Although this was due to the gradual widening of finance, the sufficient strength of various colleagues, and the considerable recognition and trust that the society has in our association organized by various colleagues, it is also conceivable. In particular, recalling the most tense period, if it were not for the active planning of various colleagues, the concentration of assets, and the increase in efficiency, the dangerous situation at that time would probably not have stopped here, and it can also be seen that the importance of collective wisdom and efforts is indispensable. In the past year, in addition to preparing matters, our association has also worked hard to prepare for the exchange of bills. Now, we will report the business situation of this year in summary as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Preparation of Assets <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Our association accepts the assets of various banks.</p>
<p>The total amount of preparation in the previous settlement was 68.04% of the total evaluated amount, and the total amount of preparation in the next settlement was 68.94% of the total evaluated amount. According to the number of next settlement, the classification of assets, real estate accounts for 0.06% of the total amount.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Certificates and Discounts <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Public Certificate Fund, Sufficient Funds</p>
<p>Eight million seven hundred and fifty thousand taels of silver were planned, but the discount business has not been implemented, as mentioned above. Most of the certificates received by various banks are stored for various preparations. There are also a few cases where they are transferred to the association for registration, or where public certificates are used to replace banknotes, but the number is not large.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Preparation for the Exchange of Bills <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The initial planning for the establishment of our association</p>
<p>The industry association immediately entrusted the handling of bill exchange. The situation was urgent, and there was no time to carry out. In early June, we began to discuss methods and agreed on the articles of association. It took five months, and the draft was drafted four or five times. The matter was a pioneering undertaking, and the monetary system was uneven, and the bill habits were mixed. Making cars suitable for the road was difficult. Relying on the urging of various banks and the guidance of power, the draft articles of association were completed in November. The draft articles of association were passed by the Sixth Congress of Representatives, and sent to the same association for approval and record. Then, the executive committee decided to use the downstairs of the industry association as the exchange site, which was opened on January 10 of the year 20. The public undertaking that our colleagues have been eager for more than ten years has fortunately been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Elected Executive Committee Members <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Ten Executive Committee Members Were Elected This Year.</p>
<p>One person is Mr. Bei Songsun, Mr. Li Fushun, Mr. Chen Guangfu, Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Mr. Hu Mengjia, Mr. Xu Shen, Mr. Tang Shoumin, Mr. Chen Zeqing, Mr. Wu Yunzhai, Mr. Hu Bijang, and Mr. Ye Fuxiao. After the conference on that day, the executive committee meeting was held to elect five managing directors. Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Mr. Bei Songsun, Mr. Li Fushun, Mr. Tang Shoumin, and Mr. Hu Mengjia were elected. Then, the managing directors mutually elected one chairman, who was elected by Mr. Li Fushun. The above-mentioned gentlemen, except for Mr. Ye Fuxiao, who is a newly appointed executive committee member this year, are all re-elected. In addition, the Chinese and Western members of the evaluation and custody groups of the association have not changed this year.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Exchange of Bills <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The bill exchange of the association was opened on January 14. All bill exchanges of silver dollar remittances, silver dollars, and silver taels have been carried out in order. Since its establishment, the results have been quite good. The average daily exchange number is about 1,000 bills and the amount is 3-4 million. The exchange of silver dollar remittances is scheduled to be implemented on March 1. It is heard that all branches of the exchange banks in this city will also join in soon. After that, the number of exchanges will increase day by day, and the convenience gained by various banks will also increase greatly. The staff sent to the office for exchange procedures are now very proficient. When the reporter visited, there were a total of seventy or eighty exchange members, who cooperated and worked in an orderly manner. The exchange of various currencies takes only ten minutes or so.</p>

<p>Internal Interpretation Does Not Limit Gender</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Approved and Ordered Compliance</p>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday approved a consultation from the Ministry of the Interior, stating that it was consulting on the matter. The Jiangsu Provincial Government's Consultation No. 25 approved the letter from the Provincial Self-Defense Committee, according to the head of Xinghua County and the head of the Self-Defense Corps, Cheng Yuyan, who requested an interpretation of whether women could be independently appointed as the head of Jia and the head of the District, and whether the original female township chiefs and district chiefs could be ordered to concurrently serve as the head of Jia and the head of the District. A special request was made for an interpretation. With this approval, it was found that the burden of people's obligations must be positively stipulated by law, and the enjoyment of rights must be sufficient if the law does not have negative stipulations. According to the County Self-Defense Law, being incorporated into the Self-Defense Corps and receiving training is the obligation of the people. Therefore, it should only be limited to the "men over 20 and under 40 years old" who meet the positive provisions of Article 5 of the law. As for the district and team captains of the Self-Defense Corps, whether they are elected by the people or concurrently appointed by the district, township, and village chiefs who are appointed according to law, or temporarily appointed by the head of the Corps before the district, township, and village chiefs are elected by the people, they are not due to the positive requirements and negative requirements of Article 5 of the County Self-Defense Corps Law. The legal obligation of course has nothing to do with the regulation that only men are required to bear the obligation of the Self-Defense Corps. Its nature is to hold local public office, which is obviously obvious. According to Article 24 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the period of political tutelage, since public service is a right, and according to Article 6 of the Provisional Constitution, men and women are legally equal, there is no reason why women cannot hold the post of District Team Shen Pai Captain in law, which is extremely clear. Therefore, not only can the district and township chiefs elected or appointed by the people concurrently serve as the District Team Jia Pai Captain, but also the County Organization Law and the Village Autonomy Implementation Law do not limit the district and township chiefs to men. Therefore, female district and township chiefs can concurrently serve as District Team Shen Pai Captains. Before the district and township chiefs are elected by the people, those who are directly appointed by the administrative organs as the District Team Shen Pai Captains also have the right to be appointed as District Team Shen Pai Captains or Deputy Captains, without any doubt. After approving the consultation, the Municipal Government has transferred it to the Security Office and the Self-Defense Corps for separate notification.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Tenants in Jiangwan District Petitioned Yesterday for Rent Reduction and Exemption of Transfer Fees <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Since the devastation of the Jiangwan District during the January 28th War last year, the essence of the entire district has been destroyed, and its vitality has not yet recovered. Recently, the tenants in the district have sent representatives to the Municipal Government to request a delay in the collection of housing donations because the Municipal Government is about to collect housing donations, and to order the landlords to reduce and exempt rent transfer fees. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, they sent representatives Zhou Meiting and others to the Municipal Government with a document to petition again for rent reduction and exemption of transfer fees. A staff member from the Second Section received them and promised to convey the requested points to the mayor. Their petition stated: "We respectfully submit this petition to request rent reduction and exemption of transfer fees, and we earnestly request a prompt instruction. After the Jiangwan District experienced the January 28th Incident, it suffered heavy losses, and merchants and people were exhausted and almost in despair. However, landlords who are contrary to reason not only do not show sympathy, but also increase rent transfer fees. Such retrograde actions are beyond the ordinary. We have submitted a document detailing our difficult situation to your office for instruction. However, several weeks have passed, and we have not received a reply. We have heard that the landlords intend to take further coercive actions, continue to increase prices, and issue eviction orders. If this continues, how can the disaster victims survive? Once they resort to danger, it will be difficult to avoid triggering a storm. Therefore, we respectfully request that your office promptly order the landlords to reduce and exempt fees as soon as possible to show fairness and attract people. We are extremely anxious and await your command. Please submit to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai, the tenants of Jiangwan District, Yu Taizhu Firm, and 54 others."</p>

<p>The reporter met with the accountant of the Yonghe Company last night. According to him, the factory's equipment has always been well-regarded, and it had also been inspected by the Social Affairs Bureau's factory inspection team. Since the Zhengtai tragedy, considerable attention has been paid to fire prevention. Unexpectedly, this unfortunate incident occurred, destroying seventeen workshops, as well as finished shoes, raw materials for leather balls, and machinery, with a total estimated loss of around 80,000 yuan. As the incident was sudden, the compensation methods will be determined after the current aftermath is handled. As for production, it must be temporarily suspended for now.</p>

<p>Zhai Da Escapes After Being Handed Over on Bail</p>
<p>Last year, in the summer month of July, a robbery occurred at the intersection of Xinqiao Road and Liyuan Road, where patrolling police officer Sun Jiming was shot and wounded by robbers, his box cannon seized, and a responding police officer, Zhang Hanchen, was killed. After the incident, the Chief of the Second District General Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with Detective Captain Lu Ying, paid exceptional attention and initiated separate, strict investigations.</p>
<p>It is now known that several principal robbers in the case were located in Zhabei, in the Hua'an Li and Changxing Li areas under the jurisdiction of the Second Sub-station of the Fifth District, based on information obtained by Wu Xiufeng, the detective squad leader stationed by the Second District Office, and his deputy, Li Bixiao Bao. Therefore, Detective Squad Leaders Wu and Li led a full team of detectives to Zhabei, where they coordinated with Inspector Chang and officers from the Second Sub-station of the Fifth District to secretly apprehend the suspects at their addresses.</p>
<p>First, at No. 5 Hua'an Li, Xinma Road, Zhai Da (Yong'an), his wife Zhang, Zhi Fakui, and Zi Zaijiang, a total of four robbers, were apprehended, and eight rounds of ammunition for a wooden-cased pistol, nine rounds of rifle ammunition, and communist materials were seized. Additionally, at No. 4 Changxing Li, Chen Huanming, Wang Denggao, and Han Chaoyu, a total of three individuals, were apprehended, and a six-inch Browning pistol, seven rounds of ammunition, and two magazines were seized. Furthermore, at No. 6 Xinma Road, Zhao Zhangshi was apprehended. All eight male and female robbers were taken to the district for questioning. According to robber Zhai Da's initial confession:</p>
<p>(i.e., Zhai Yong'an), 32 years old, from Huaicheng, confessed that in the summer of last year, he gathered accomplices Mao Hongxi, Hu Zhaoxi, Gu Dianjiu, Ji Xizhou, and Chen Wenming, carrying pistols. At the intersection of Xinqiao Road and Liyuan Road, they wounded the on-duty police officer. Hu Zhaoxi held him down while Mao Hongxi shot him. Gu Dianjiu used a knife to cut the armed leather belt, seizing the box cannon and killing the responding police officer. Afterwards, they headed south, throwing the wooden pistol case in front of No. 190 Xinqiao Road, and then...</p>

<p>The Case Against Li Himself Was Also Heard Yesterday</p>
<p>證人杜少如左右做人難</p>
<p>Witness Du Shaoru Finds It Difficult to Please Both Sides</p>
<p>Since its establishment, Li Yushan, the general manager of Shashi Textile Company, has held exclusive power. Although the company has been profitable every year, the profits have never been distributed to the shareholders. Recently, Yin Geru, a shareholder, discovered that Li had engaged in private corruption in many ways, such as missing nineteen blank stock certificates, nineteen shareholder interest slips, and colluding with the former accountant Jin Youjun, who had already resigned, to fabricate the name of Yan Deji (i.e., Yan De, a shareholder and manager of the closed Tongxin Qianzhuang), and misappropriating funds. Yin then hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-lawsuit against Li Yushan, divided into four counts, requesting investigation to protect the interests of the shareholders. The First Special District Court has held two hearings, as previously reported. Now, Gao Jiaren, a standing director of the company, because Jin Youjun embezzled more than ten thousand taels of company funds,</p>
<p>the board of directors resolved to have him recover the funds. A long time has passed, but Jin has not repaid a penny. Therefore, he also took advantage of Yin Geru's accusation against Li and hired another lawyer to file a lawsuit against Jin for embezzlement. The complaint states that Jin Youjun was introduced by Li Yushan, the general manager of the company, to serve as the company's accountant, in charge of the inflow and outflow of money and recording accounts, with a monthly salary. However, Jin Youjun privately used the company's funds, amounting to more than 15,900 taels, including more than 13,000 taels transferred through Wanfeng Flower Shop, which was established by General Manager Li Yushan.</p>
<p>According to the company's monthly cash income and expenditure, all transactions are first recorded in the cash flow account, then summarized into the general ledger, and then passed through the flower clearing and zhuang clearing accounts. Therefore, the cash flow is the basic account, recording daily and cannot be falsely registered. The funds used by Jin Youjun were not recorded in the cash flow account, nor were they recorded in the general ledger, only in the flower clearing account, and they were paid through Wanfeng, indicating a suspicion of private embezzlement, which cannot escape the crime under Article 366 of the criminal law. After the discovery, the board of directors held a meeting and resolved to dismiss Jin Youjun and appointed Jiaren to investigate and execute. He immediately reviewed the account books, affixed seals, and pursued Jin Youjun for repayment.</p>
<p>Initially, Jiaren's intention was only to have the company's public funds returned and the shareholders' capital intact, and he was also unwilling to investigate further. Unexpectedly, Jin Youjun first ignored it, and then requested reinstatement and dividends. General Manager Li Yushan, as the matter involved Wanfeng, which he established, had unavoidable suspicions of collusion and favored Jin. Jiaren believed that Jin Youjun returning the embezzled public funds was a matter of course, and since there had been fraudulent activities, it seemed inappropriate to re-employ him. Therefore, he did not grant his request, and the board of supervisors also had the same intention. On the 10th of this month, the board of supervisors held a meeting and again instructed Jiaren to investigate and handle the matter according to law. Therefore, he truthfully stated the matter, humbly requesting a prompt summons to investigate, convict according to law, and attached a private lawsuit, requesting that Jin Youjun be ordered to return the embezzled public funds in full,</p>
<p>to uphold the law and protect private rights, and so on. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special Court presided over the hearing of both cases. Only Li Yushan arrived as the defendant, while Jin Youjun was evading attendance. Judge Wu announced that he would first hear Gao Jiaren's case against Jin Youjun. According to the bailiff's report, he first went to Wanfeng Flower Shop to summon the defendant Jin Youjun, but the people there said that Jin was at Zhengtai Qianzhuang in Fusui Li, Tianjin Road. When he went to that qianzhuang, they claimed that Jin had returned to his hometown in Shaoxing. Therefore, he returned the summons. Then, the plaintiff Gao Jiaren stated that Youjun was indeed still in Shanghai</p>
<p>and went to Shashi Company for meals every day because Li Yushan had Jin stamp the missing nineteen blank stock certificates. Li was afraid that Jin's arrival in court would be detrimental to him, so he deliberately kept Jin's address secret. Moreover, Jin was a high-ranking employee of the company, and his address must be clearly stated on his bond. Now, if one wants to know Jin's address clearly, one only needs to order Li Yushan to submit Jin's bond to the court, and one will be able to find it by following the clues. The court then questioned Li Yushan. According to his statement, there was no bond when Jin was the accountant. He had seen Jin four or five days ago, but now he did not know his whereabouts. Judge Wu considered that the defendant Jin Youjun was intentionally evading the court</p>
<p>and ordered that he be detained and brought to court. The hearing was rescheduled for the afternoon of March 3. He immediately announced that he would continue to hear Yin Geru's private prosecution of Li Yushan for breach of trust and embezzlement. The defendant's lawyer stated that the witness, Du Shaoru, the chairman of the board of directors of Shashi Company, had gone to Chongming for business and would be able to attend the next hearing. Du Lunjiu, Du's nephew, arrived in court and claimed that his uncle had left Shanghai on the 25th and would return to Shanghai around the 5th or 6th of next month. However, the plaintiff Yin Geru claimed that Du Shaoru had not gone to Chongming and had seen him yesterday because he had been summoned to testify this time. If he told the truth in court, it would be detrimental to Li Yushan.</p>
<p>If he lied, it would be related to his own character, so he claimed that he had gone to Chongming, hoping to avoid it. The court then summoned Jiaren and Ni Zhenxiang, the remaining witnesses, who had both arrived in court, to first question them about the Yan Deji debt. According to Gao's statement, he initially did not know about the debt. It was only when he occasionally checked the company's accounts in April or May of last year that he discovered that Yan Deji owed the company more than 43,500 taels. He then reported it to Chairman Du Shaoru, who was extremely dissatisfied with Li Yushan's behavior. However, because his shareholding was extremely small, although he expressed his opposition, the other shareholders paid little attention. Although he attended the board meeting on February 10 of this year, he left before the end of the meeting, so he did not hear about the various matters discussed. Although the Yan Deji debt was also discussed that day, it was changed to Li Yuji, indicating that Li would repay it in the future.</p>
<p>This kind of procedure was a last-minute patching up, because Li had set up the Yan Deji account privately the year before and had not first sought the consent of the shareholders or directors. He then asked Ni Zhenxiang whether he knew about the Xie Deji debt. Ni's statement was the opposite of Gao's, saying that Li Yushan had obtained the consent of Chairman Du Shaoru before transferring this account. Judge Wu, having questioned to this point, ordered that the hearing be continued on the afternoon of March 8.</p>
<p>face, heading north to return home. I sent the box cannon to Zhang Tieru in Nanjing, selling it for 80 yuan. It's been about half a month. Zhang lives at No. 80 Xiaohuangfuqian, Nanjing. There have been many other robbery cases elsewhere." Chen Huanming confessed</p>
<p>stated that he was 27 years old, from Huaicheng, residing at No. 4 Changxing Li, Chaomibang, Xinma Road. In July or August of last year, he robbed a cigarette paper shop in the Public Character House in Nanshi of more than 30 yuan. Zhai Da, Mao Hongxi, Tang Laowu, Chen Wenming, Hu Zhaoxi, Gu Dianjiu, and Ji Xizhou went to rob it together. They also robbed two gold rings from pedestrians on the road near that place. Mao Hongxi had discussed it several times in Bannan, so in early November of last year, they robbed a resident on Nanshi Manufacturing Bureau Road, robbing more than 100 yuan in cash, a fur robe, a lined coat and trousers, and other items. Zhai Da sent the box cannon to Nanjing. Zhai Da gave the pistol to me three or four days ago, and I transferred the gun to Wang Denggao. Wang Denggao confessed</p>
<p>stated that he was 40 years old, from Huai'an. On the 11th day of the first month of this year, he was the contact of Qian Rongsheng and Chen Er, gathered Chen Huanming, Zhao Kaixiang, Han Chaoyu, Chen Xiaoli, Cai Yunsheng, Mao Hongxi, and other nine people, carrying a box cannon and a pistol, and robbed a Zhang-named rickshaw company in the Xiaoximen area around 7 or 8 p.m. I received 25 yuan. The others said that Chen Er was stingy. All the clothes were pawned by Chen Er. Also, on the afternoon of December 20 of last year, they robbed a Doufu shop of a certain surname at the Jingjiang Road intersection, robbing clothes, silver dollars, copper coins, and other items. I received a few pieces of clothing. Han Yu, Chen Er, Chen Xiaoli, and Chen Er's father-in-law were there. Han Chaoyu confessed</p>
<p>stated that he was 29 years old, from Huaicheng. He came out to work from Jiangbei in October of last year. He met Zhai Da when he ate pancakes at a pancake shop every day. He called me several times, and later he told me to rob at Xiaoximen. I didn't go in, but I only got 5 yuan. It was robbed from the rickshaw company, Zhao, and so on. Zhao Zhangshi, the wife of Zhao Kaixiang, confessed</p>
<p>All the lined jackets and clothes were brought by my husband. I heard that they were stolen goods. Zhai Xushi, the wife of Zhai Da, confessed</p>
<p>stated that she was 26 years old, from Zhuncheng. My own husband farms in Jiangbei. I came to Shanghai after being robbed by Zhai Da in Jiangbei. I have lost my freedom and have been coerced into being his wife. The suspect Zhi Fakui confessed</p>
<p>stated that he was 32 years old, from Haizhou, residing at No. 5 Hua'an Li, and had never robbed anyone. Yu Zaijiang confessed</p>
<p>stated that he was 41 years old, from Huaicheng, and made a living by pulling rickshaws. Chen Leiyu confessed</p>
<p>stated that he was 23 years old, from Haizhou, and made a living by selling pancakes, residing in a thatched house in North Caowu, Zhongxing Road. Zuo Yunheng confessed</p>
<p>stated that he was 41 years old, from Jiangbei, and made a living by pulling rickshaws, residing at No. 4 Changxing Li, Chaomibang. After District Chief Jin of the Second District separately questioned each confession, the case of shooting a police officer and seizing a box cannon was handled by Zhai Da, who sent it to Zhang Tieru's house at No. 80 Xiaohuangfuqian in Nanjing.</p>
<p>This matter is important. Squad Leaders Wu and Li should lead detectives and take the criminal Zhai Da to Beijing to recover the original stolen items. The criminal Zhai Da (Yong'an) boarded the overnight passenger train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to Nanjing from Shanghai at 9 p.m. the night before. After arriving in Beijing, Deputy Squad Leader Li led detectives and the criminal to open Room 33 at the Dajin Hotel in Huiyuan Street. The criminal Zhai Yong'an was guarded by detectives Yuan Mingcai and Chen Guangli. Meanwhile, Deputy Squad Leader Li Xiaobao, holding official documents, took Detective Xu Ziliang to the police department to submit the documents, requesting assistance, and met with the detective team of the Gendarmerie Headquarters. Team Leader Wang Zheng immediately dispatched two detectives to disguise themselves and accompany Deputy Squad Leader Li to Zhang Tieru's house at No. 80 Xiaohuangfuqian, claiming that the criminal Zhai Yong'an had something to discuss. When they arrived, Zhang Hua Tieru was not at home. His brother Chen Boyang came</p>
<p>out to help find him. Before long, his brother arrived home with Zhang Tieru. Then Deputy Squad Leader Li Xiaobao of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Zhang. (This person's original name was Zhang Tilu, and he is now working as a secret agent in the Central Party Department and has changed his name to Chen Ziping.) At that time, the deputy squad leader was about to take Zhang away when a person arrived, Ji Yuanpu, an employee of the Investigation Section of the Central Organization Committee, came forward to provide a written guarantee. Therefore, Deputy Squad Leader Li handed Zhang over to Ji Yuanpu, an employee of the Investigation Section of the Central Party Department, to take him back to the Party Department for handling. While the handover was in progress, Yu Jun, the owner of the Dajin Hotel, rushed over and reported that the criminal Zhai Da (Yong'an), who was being guarded at the hotel, had suddenly escaped.</p>

<p>Rickshaw Rental Prices Soar</p>
<p>車夫呈請市府救濟</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Petition the Municipal Government for Relief</p>
<p>Dagong She Yun, the public concession rickshaws in the city (licenses issued by the Public Works Department) total 10,000, contracted out by the head contractors, then sublet to small contractors. Regulations stipulate that the rental price of each rickshaw per day is 8 jiao and a half in small foreign currency, sublet to small contractors, then sublet to rickshaw pullers for operation. Regulations stipulate that the rental price of each rickshaw per day is 9 jiao and a half in small foreign currency. Unexpectedly, recently, small contractors have secretly raised the price, and the rental price of each rickshaw has soared to 13 jiao. The rickshaw pullers are suffering from the monopoly of the small contractors, who exploit the coolies. The income earned from daily work is used to pay the rickshaw rental, and there is not enough money for food and accommodation. More than 60 rickshaw pullers from the Public Concession and the French Concession in Pudong, Puxi, Zhabei, and Punan jointly elected representatives Meng Jinchen, Liu Fujun, and others to submit a petition to the Municipal Government and the Executive Yuan, requesting relief. Yesterday, the Municipal Government received instructions from the Executive Yuan to carefully consider methods to ensure the livelihoods of the coolies. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government transferred it to the Social Affairs and Public Utilities Bureaus to draft appropriate methods and submit them for verification.</p>
<p>楊子清案綁票匪辯論終結</p>
<p>Closing Arguments Conclude in the Yang Ziqing Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Yang Ziqing, a resident of Dixiang, Yangshupu, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits without a trace during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai last year. Later, several ransom letters were received, demanding a high price. While his family was investigating, Zhang Qiutao went to them, saying that she could find a way to redeem him, defrauding them of a large sum of money. After the victim's family reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, Zhang confessed that the case was carried out by Zhu Xiaogou, Yang Dong, Chen Ziwen, and others. Yang Dong was a cousin. The ticket was hidden in Zhoujiaqiao. She had no relationship with it and was actually swindling money. Therefore, the First Special District Court sentenced Zhang Qiutao to six months' imprisonment and a fine of 500 yuan. However, Yang's family went to the Sixth District Police Station to accuse them. The detective team successively arrested Zhu Zigou, Chen Ziwen, Yang Dong, etc. The confessions of the detective team at that time were to kidnap Yang Ziqing and first hide him in Zhoujiaqiao, then to Beixinjing, and then to Qingpu, etc. Therefore, he was escorted to the District Court. After being questioned by the Garrison Headquarters once, he was still returned to the court. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution for kidnapping and extortion. The defendants all stated in court that this was not the case. They were subjected to tiger benches and chili water灌鼻 in the detective team, and they were at their disposal. That's how they spoke and how they confessed. Therefore, the Criminal Court President asked for details and reinvestigated. Yesterday morning, he gathered for another trial. According to the wife of the victim, Yang Li, who came to court, the kidnappers are still writing letters for ransom, so she requested an ancillary civil lawsuit to return her husband, etc. The defendants still confessed as before and hired a lawyer to defend them, saying that the defendants were in custody. How could they ask for ransom again, etc. After the prosecutor issued an opinion, the judge announced the end of the debate, and the verdict will be pronounced on March 6.</p>

<p>Business News Finance The Price of Gold Wavered Slightly After a Day's Fluctuation, Falling One or Two Taels Overseas Silver Market Opens High and Falls</p>
<p>Telegraphic Silver Favors Midway Decline</p>
<p>Central Bank's Continuous Cash Opening Results in Stability</p>
<p>The gold market was fairly stable in the morning, but weakened in the afternoon, though slightly lower than last Saturday. At the start of the morning, foreign telegrams indicated declines of 125 in both London bullion and New York silver prices. Exchange rate fluctuations were minimal. Gold Exchange forward prices slightly decreased by 0.15%. American cotton dropped by over ten pounds. Bank private telegrams also fell by 125. The opening price for standard gold was 775.2 taels, initially fluctuating with sentiment between five and six taels, once rising to 8.1 taels. Later, banks tended to hold back. HSBC and Mercantile offered March US dollars at 8.75 yuan, and saw downstream interest. HSBC's listed British and American exchange rates remained unchanged and were even smaller, but there were still several struggles, hovering around six taels. Near the noon closing, news came from foreign telegrams that American banks had suspended cash withdrawals, causing sudden unease. The gold market moved downstream, and the exchange market eased. The noon closing price was 75.1 taels. The afternoon opening immediately dropped to 714.1 taels, because Mercantile bought June US dollars at .25, reaching 4.7 taels. However, sentiment was extremely poor, and the exchange market slightly hardened. Foreign telegrams also brought news of American support for the Bank of Japan, causing a further drop to 70 taels. But Hengxing continuously opened cash on behalf of the Central Bank, holding the gold price at the 70 tael mark, preventing it from breaking, though it required considerable effort. There were several approaches to the 70 tael level, but it was ultimately held. Therefore, the closing price was 770.08 taels. Throughout the day, despite a period of rising, the price ultimately remained low. The Central Bank entrusted Hengxing to open a total of 945 cash, with prices ranging from one to two taels, though rumors indicated that one tael was the most common. No wonder the 70 tael mark was difficult to break. Spot interest remained small, calculated at an addition of 11.5 taels. March-April swaps were priced at 2.9 to 3.2 taels. Various spot numbers were traded out, likely due to ships carrying goods arriving in port yesterday. The trend remains within a range-bound scenario. Today, the morning market conditions are detailed below:</p>
<p>The morning opened with a slight increase to 775.2 taels, up 3.3 taels from last Saturday's closing price. Goods opened at 5.3 taels. The exchange market opened with recent British exchange rates at 1 shilling 8 pence .25, and US dollars at 28.75 yuan, both slightly tighter than last Saturday's noon closing, but not by much. Therefore, initially hovering between 5 and 5.5 taels, and as Yuanmao Yong, etc., bought in slightly, it gradually improved to 6.8 taels. Qianchangxiang sold off aggressively, causing a drop to 4.5 taels. Subsequently, transactions began in the exchange market. Wah Bi bought spot US dollars at .8125, and Fuchangheng Yu suddenly bought up to over six taels. Dadecheng even advanced to 7.7 taels, but at this point, many limit orders wanted to sell, and goods also came to capitalize. Wah Bi sold April US exchange at 8.75, and Yuanxin Yong also sold, causing a drop to 6.7 taels. Zhifeng Yong entered the market to buy, and at this time, June US dollars were priced at 29.125 yuan, improving to 8.1 taels. Mercantile and HSBC both sold March US exchange at .75. Hengyu and Daxing Yong sold to seven taels. Daxing Yong sold even more, reaching six taels. Mercantile also placed a limit order for June US dollars at .125. Fuyu Zhaofengchang sold down to 5.3 taels. HSBC's listed British and American rates remained unchanged, dropping further to 4.7 taels. Hengyu Yifeng Yong bought in slightly, rebounding a bit, but sentiment was uncertain. In a blink, it dropped again to five taels. Mercantile bought June US dollars at .1875, and goods came in, adding up to 5.9 taels. Fuyu sold again, at 5.1 taels. Dadecheng came to buy at over six taels, and May US dollars at .0625 were not easily settled, but Daxing Yong suddenly came to buy, leading to a rush to 6.9 taels. After this, it hovered around six taels. The exchange market also quieted down. Richang Hengxing slightly sold off at this point, but goods and retail investors bought in, balancing the situation. Mercantile bought June US dollars at .25, rising from over five to over six taels. After a long period of hovering, Mercantile bought another .1875 of the same month, pushing it to 7.1 taels, as this month's shillings at .25 were not easy to buy. Hengyu came to sell, dropping one tael to six taels. News came from American bankers that cash withdrawals were being suspended, and the exchange market also eased slightly. June US dollars at .1875 could be settled, dropping to 4.8 taels, then rising a few cents. The closing price was 775.1 taels. Selling sentiment remained strong after the closing, with retail investors and goods all selling, continuing to retreat to around four. Therefore, goods were auctioned at 4.3 taels.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 774.1 taels. Initially, there were mutual ups and downs, and Wang Ruixing, Qingfa Yong, Hongli all came to buy in, so gradually rose from 3.3 taels, as Mercantile was expected to buy June US dollars at .25, to 4.7 taels. However, this price could not be sold inter-bank. Daxing Yong sold to four taels, Yifeng Yong also sold, and it was three taels. June US dollars at .3125 could be settled, Fuyu and Daxing Yong, Dakang all came to sell, and then retreated to within two taels. There was hopeful news about the US silver coinage bill, Daxing Yong and Fuyu all came to sell, falling to within one tael, to .06 taels. Hengxing came to open cash on behalf of the Central Bank, and Yuanmao Yong also bought, so it reached around one tael. March US dollars at 8.75 were not easy to buy, and improved to over two taels. Helan even bought May at .1875, adding up to 2.6 taels. Qingfa Yong and Dadecheng all sold, retreating to within one tael. Wah Bi sold this month's US dollars at 8.125, and Dadecheng sold even more, to one tael. Yuanmao Yong sold for .03 taels. Hengxing bought in again, and Mercantile also bought June US dollars at .3125, improving to 1.6 taels, but retail investor sentiment was not good, and it continued to decline, reaching 70 taels. However, Hengyu, etc., purchased at limit prices, and Wanxing also bought in, pulling it to one tael. Zhifeng Yong entered the market to buy in, and rose to 1.6 taels. Zhaofengchang, Yuanchun, and Fuyu still sold, retreating to one tael. Hengxing bought in to 1.8 taels, but the exchange market frequently eased. Shanghai sold March US dollars at 8.75, and another round of declines began, reaching 70 taels. Although sentiment was bad, this level was not easy to break again. Hengxing repeatedly opened cash on behalf of the Central Bank, continuing to rise to one tael. Tongyi also repeatedly bought in on behalf of Hengxing, so the gold price was able to be held up. There was a lot of hovering at this time. Finally, Hengxing sold on behalf of a customer, causing a drop to .07 taels, but because Fuchang bought in, the closing price was 770.08 taels. There were many sellers after the closing, so goods were auctioned at 70 taels, and finally broke 70 taels, reaching around nine. The highest price of the day was 778 taels, and the lowest price was 770 taels, with fluctuations of 8.1 taels. The result was a drop of 1.1 taels compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The quoted price, because HSBC's listed US exchange rate did not change, remained at 28.375 yuan, corresponding to a gold price of 845.818 taels. In terms of the closing price, it was approximately 75 taels, more than one tael higher than the previous closing. This month's allotment is already flat, so no entry. March entry price 780 taels, April 775 taels, morning make-up water 777 taels, afternoon 773 taels.</p>
<p>Sellers on the floor were extremely active, but transactions were not frequent. In summary, Hengxing, Yuanheng, Yuanmao Yong, Hongli, Zhifeng Yong, Qingfa Yong, Neixing, Chunyuan Yong, etc., all bought in, while Fuyu, Dakang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanchun, Qianchangxiang, Yifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Hengyu, etc., all sold out. There were not many transactions from the Dalian faction, while Hengxing from the Guangdong faction bought in over 500. Shengda was silent. The allotment for April up to last Saturday totaled 27,664.</p>
<p>The Central Bank opened 945 cash in the afternoon, with Hengxing acting as agent: 630 at the price of one tael, 105 at the price of 1.5 taels, and 110 at the price of two taels.</p>
<p>The premium for spot silver in yesterday's market was 11.5 taels, and transactions were not frequent. Only Taikangrun sold to Yingfenghheng Yiping in the market, with transactions of less than 100 taels. Later, the Hankou faction sold to Yingfenghheng, with quantities not large, but prices were higher, generally between 12.5 and 13 taels.</p>
<p>Swaps were also flat, with the premium slightly smaller. The initial price for March-April was a debit of three taels. Dadecheng debited Dafenghheng 70, Xiangfeng debited Yingfenghheng 91, and later Dadecheng debited Yingfenghheng 70 at the price of 2.9 qian. Ruikang debited Yingfenghheng 91, still at three taels. In March, Hengxing sold Yingfenghheng 42, at the price of 80 taels and one qian, while in the afternoon, the debit price was slightly higher, with Qingfa Yong debiting Yingfenghheng 56, at the price of 3.2 qian, with 56 transactions. All February allocations up to last Saturday still owed 14, but they are now cleared, with Qingfa Yong releasing 14, and Hengxing and Runchang Yong each receiving seven. The March allotment up to the day before totaled 2,730.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Gradually Hardens</p>
<p>Banks Sell More Than Buy</p>
<p>Initially, the exchange market was due to London's big transactions, New York's silver prices, and bank private telegrams all contracting by 125. British exchange against the US dollar fell by 125, and the US dollar against the British pound remained unchanged. The Gold Exchange's forward silver price was slightly lower by 0.015%, so the morning opening offered recent prices for British exchange at 1 shilling 8 pence .125, and US dollars at 28.75 yuan, both tighter than last Saturday by .0625. After the opening, it was still flat. June US dollars were first priced at 29.125 yuan, and HSBC's listed prices did not change. Afterwards, it gradually hardened, but Kenner was willing to buy at low prices. Later, due to foreign telegrams that President Hoover had approved all banks to stop cash withdrawals, it suddenly became hard. In the early afternoon, June US dollars at 29.25 yuan were in between buying and selling, but later became looser due to the US seeming to have a solution for silver coins. June US dollars were now priced at 3125, but banks tended to buy in. At closing, the offered price for British exchange was 1 shilling 8 pence .25 (or .3125), and US dollars at 28.8125. Banks were inclined to hold back in the morning, and in the afternoon they also sold more than they bought. Mercantile and Citibank sold shillings, while Wah Bi and the Central Bank placed a limit order on US dollars. Pan Gen and Zhengjin bought US dollars, and Jinze also bought more than it sold. British and American exchange rates traded twice at 3 yuan and 4 jiao 2 fen, all spot transactions, with China buying shillings at .25 and selling US dollars at .85625. Mercantile and Wah Bi paired off, with daily fluctuations totaling .1875 (US dollars), while shillings were flatter.

<p>The Silver Exchange Market is Calm as Before</p>
<p>Market Observations</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the market was affected by the extended trading hours due to competition for high exchange rates. This was because yesterday was a securities settlement day, causing a money shortage. Buyers were also unwilling to accept due to standard price concerns. Therefore, large transactions were combined into one market, not dispersing. Banks, including Zhongjiao and Central, had no appetite to accept them. Silver money firms also needed to settle before ending due to the inability to flexibly pay in silver dollars. Therefore, there was a need to extend the trading hours. The newly set standard price of 7 qian, 1 fen, and 5 li per silver dollar is difficult to change old habits quickly, and is still in the queue. As for the market price of subsidiary currency, it will still be calculated according to the old rules or in terms of silver dollar amounts, and it is said that small money firms have not yet taken any action.</p>

[Silver Exchange] The morning and afternoon markets were both 4 fen, an increase of 2 fen compared to the previous day. The spread was also good at 1 fen, estimated to be at 4 to 5 fen.

Guangdong small dollars opened at 5 qian, 8 fen, 5 li, 6 hao, 2 si, 0.5 hu in the morning, and 5 qian, 8 fen, 5 li, 0.5 hao in the afternoon, a difference of only .125, with 90,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by 1,000 wen, to 421,000 wen.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Plunges, Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: Last Saturday (February 25th), the New York stock market already showed weakness in the morning. Later, due to the financial turmoil in Maryland, the governor ordered all banks to temporarily suspend operations to save the crisis. Stocks and bonds on the stock exchange suddenly became quite weak, plummeting five yuan, while bank stocks fell one to twelve yuan. Half-day transaction volume totaled 989,000 shares. Also, in the week from February 11th to 18th, there were a total of 514,390 railroad freight cars, an increase of 12,070 compared to the previous week. According to last week's stock market, the downward trend was very strong, and the main reason was the rising trend of financial turmoil. The previous Michigan turmoil was one wave not yet subsided, and another wave rose again, so individuals and companies were wary and selling was not quiet. At the same time, banks, alarmed by the deteriorating situation, had to prepare more cash to meet emergencies, so they sold securities on the market, and the result not only hindered commercial recovery, but made the market increasingly tired. Future developments are difficult to predict. The Dow Jones Index for today is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 50.93 Down 1.91</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 23.43 Down 1.66</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 21.14 Down 1.14</p>
<p>40 Bonds 76.14 Down 0.61</p>
<p>More Current Yarn Purchased from Sha Hua, Yunnan, and Guangdong</p>
<p>No Transactions of Raw Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn's actual demand showed some improvement in the southern ports, which slightly raised sentiment, but the overseas cotton market was trending downward, war clouds were looming in the northeast, and financing was still not fully relaxed, so it was somewhat unsatisfactory. If yarn sales continue to come, the market should have good prospects. According to statistics for the entire day, various factions bought 1,500 bales of forward and spot goods, with price fluctuations of around five qian. The buying amounts of various factions are as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland 275</p>
<p>Wuhu 5</p>
<p>Changsha 40</p>
<p>Shantou 10</p>
<p>Guangdong 625</p>
<p>Yunnan 440</p>
<p>Ningbo 30</p>
<p>Luzhou ·0</p>
<p>The cotton market was flat, because the overseas cotton market was sluggish, which made factories think tiredly, but holders of goods saw the activity of yarn sales and were unwilling to relax prices, resulting in very few transactions. The source was estimated at 200 bales of Yao Hua cotton.</p>
<p>Retrospective and Settlement of This Month's Futures of Standard Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn: The opening price for February cotton yarn on September 1st of last year was 155.3 taels. At this time, American cotton was undergoing drastic changes, and the yarn market peaked at 158. Unexpectedly, the second estimate was released on September 8th, plummeting over 100 pounds, and the world cotton industry was greatly shocked. The yarn market fell sharply from this point. Although Rongxing's main bulls tried their best to maintain it, the world trend was like this, and the domestic rural economy was bankrupt, yarn sales were hopeless, and the market became more and more depressed. Since then, this spring, it happened that foreign aggression was urgent, the national crisis was heavy, financing was urgent, business was bleak, and there were about 130,000 bales of goods piled up in Shanghai. Panic suddenly rose, and the bulls saw the bad environment and suddenly showed signs of shaking. The lowest point was 136.5 taels. Later, some silver money firms and arbitrageurs recovered, and the market price rose slightly. As a result, the last trade was 38.5 taels, with 6,100 bales remaining. 1,600 bales were actually settled, and the rest were settled independently. The goods were 20-count yarn such as Caihua, Longchuan, and Songhe. The settlement price was 138 taels. The brand names and bale amounts of the receiving and delivering brokers are listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton: The opening price for February Standard Cotton on September 1st of last year was 24.7 taels. At this time, American cotton reached a high of 9 points, so the peak for Standard Cotton also reached over 35 taels. Unexpectedly, the second estimate of American cotton was released, plummeting wildly, so this cotton was hit hard by the world trend, and it was difficult to support. The market fell sharply. Since then, this spring, yarn markets have fallen sharply, Indian cotton has trended downwards, and factories have purchased cheap Indian cotton, and the market has been hit even harder. The lowest point was 30.03 taels, and the last trade was 30.045 taels. As a result, 17,800 dan remained. The settlement goods were all Tianjin coarse lint cotton. 11,000 dan were actually settled, and the rest were settled independently. The settlement price was 30.05 taels.

<p>Grain, River-Bottom Rice Scarce, Price Up 2 Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai): Yesterday, the source was still the blocking of transport boats, with none arriving in Shanghai. The rice accumulated in Shanghai has been sold off in recent days, and the amount of rice is gradually running out. Although the retail sales are stagnant, the price has increased due to the lack of goods, especially in the Nanbang gang. The price is up 2 jiao. Changbang Du Yangjian and Bian Yin Yuan have ordinary sales, and the market remains stable. The factory goods are only early rice for sale, with a price of 7 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai): Yesterday, there were still no goods arriving from the river bottom. Various boatmen requested light bushels, concentrated in Huangdu and other places, waiting for a solution, resulting in few boats arriving in recent days. There are few boats remaining at the river bottom. Bai Geng is running light, and the price is tight. Various Jians and Yin Yuan, etc., are fluctuating. 10,000 bags of Ke You continued to arrive.</p>
<p>Sales on This Street Are Slightly Slack</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian continued to buy on this street. The Fuzhou gang's handling turned strong, and the market seemed to be gradually turning towards an inkstone image. However, the source of Ke Xian was very strong. Yesterday, 10,000 bags of Hunan and Jiangxi Ke Xian were loaded by Jianghua Hongli. After this batch arrived, the market's sentiment weakened, and the handling on this street turned slack. Although there was an appetite, it was not as greedy as before. The market price immediately softened by .25 fen. The unified city sold 1,500 bags of Jiangxi Ji Wan, with a price of 8 yuan and 7 jiao, then decreased to 8 yuan and 5 jiao, 8 fen, with the middle grade being 8 yuan and 5 jiao to 1 jiao, 5 fen, and also 73 bags of Ji Zao, with a price of 7 yuan and 4 jiao, 5 fen, 805 bags of Hunan Ji Hongmi, with a price of 8 yuan and 3 jiao, 5 fen, and also 533 bags of Ting Hongmi, with a price of 7 yuan, and also 280 bags of Ji Youmi, with a price of 8 yuan and 6 jiao, 4 fen, of which 300 bags of Jiangxi Ji Wan were handled by the Fuzhou gang, and 533 bags of Hunan Cao Hongmi were also handled by this street, etc.</p>
<p>Bulls Close Out, Flour Market Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed signs of decline in all months. The quoted price for foreign wheat decreased by .2 or .3 yuan. This month was also the last day, and the extra-market bulls had to gradually close out. The situation in the north was becoming more serious, and it was expected that there would be few large sales. Therefore, market sentiment was not good after opening. Sentiment for forward positions also appeared flat and tired, and selling sentiment was stronger than buying sentiment. Transactions were also slightly more active. When the market opened in the afternoon, the situation in this month was even more bleak, because factories still had many chips, and outsiders closed out one after another. At three or four points, it was as low as 1 tael and 7 qian, 8 fen. Later, due to Xinda and Fufeng factories making up for the market, market sentiment rebounded by several cents. Forward positions generally revolved. As for the situation of current foreign wheat, 4,000 tons of Canadian wheat were also transacted, with a set price of 3 taels, 4 qian, 7 fen for number 2, and 3 taels, 4 qian, 1 fen for number 3. With this laxity, it is not easy for the flour market to improve. As a result, this month fell .5 fen compared to the previous week, March-April fell .5 li, May fell 1 fen, June fell .75 li, and July fell .2 li, etc.</p>
<p>The Wheat Market Was Initially Stable, Then Tired</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed signs of initial stability and tiredness in all months. Although foreign wheat was quoted low in the morning, sell-off accounts were active, and the market trend was stable. In the afternoon, due to the decline in the flour market and the continued transaction of Canadian wheat, although transactions were still scant, sentiment was already weak, and the Canadian wheat was estimated to be priced at 3 taels, 4 qian, and 7 fen. Therefore, the new wheat market is relatively expensive, so future changes may be in the direction of new wheat. As a result, March was down 2 fen compared to the closing price of the previous week, April-May were compared, and July was down 1 fen. Also, a Chicago wheat telegram on the 25th stated that it fell due to stock market weakness and bullish closing. Also, 10 million bushels were traded on the previous day. The market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>May 47 Down 1.000</p>
<p>July 47.5 Down 1.000</p>
<p>September 48.625 Down 0.875</p>
<p>Various Miscellaneous</p>

<p>Opportunistic Eyes 文炳 Hometown Reflections I always dreaded returning to my hometown. When I was studying, every time I went back, I couldn't escape the many comments from the villagers. Some said good things, some said bad things, but they all boiled down to this: "This child seems promising, speaks reasonably well, and writes decently. However, he's studying foreign books, so he's likely to forget his roots and become a superficial, half-baked intellectual."</p>
<p>However, from certain perspectives, it did make me feel proud. For example, when I first returned from school, the first few days were filled with invitations to eat and drink. One family would invite me for wine, another for a meal. And when it was time to go back to school, someone would send a piece of salted meat, or a package of boiled eggs. These were acts of great kindness, filled with boundless hope. I thought to myself, "I really must study hard to live up to their expectations."</p>
<p>As for my parents, siblings, it was even better. My mother only worried that there wasn't a stove in the school to keep me warm, if I was cold, that I didn't have snacks to eat, and if I was used to it or not; my father only questioned whether the school rules were strict, what classes I was taking, and what books I was reading; my elder brother, who had his own household, would invite me to come over to play and eat. My sisters would wash my clothes and sew my socks, all showing extra affection and treating me exceptionally well.</p>
<p>When I went back, they didn't expect gifts from me. Even if my clothes were patched and old, they respected me, saying it was a rare and good habit, not learning extravagance.</p>
<p>In short, at that time, in the eyes of the villagers or my family, there was no hint of opportunism. They sincerely hoped that I would study hard and be a good person. However, now I often think that, in reality, the seeds of opportunism were already subtly planted.</p>
<p>Things are different now. This year when I went back, I felt persecuted by a strong sense of opportunism.</p>
<p>On the night I arrived home, the neighbors on both sides came to see me with unusual enthusiasm, all saying, "Congratulations, Mr. So-and-so, for returning home! May you have wealth and happiness!" My mother had passed away, so there was no comfort to be had. My father was overjoyed, and my siblings also surrounded me affectionately. I knew why they were doing this, which made my heart beat strangely and feel awkward. My stomach was hungry, so I just devoured my food like a wolf.</p>
<p>Everyone left, except my father, who was still warming himself by the fire. My heart seemed a little lighter, and my expression became more natural. So I pulled myself together, mustered my courage, and wanted to sincerely confess to my father. But then I hesitated, because the truth was too difficult for me to say. After studying for so long, I only had a little over one dollar and thirty cents in my pocket when I came home. I really felt I was letting people down.</p>
<p>However, if I didn't confess, and everyone continued to have such high hopes, that wouldn't be a solution either. I finally said in a low voice,</p>
<p>"Father, I've come back empty-handed. I really couldn't earn any money outside, which has disappointed you. Please forgive me!"</p>
<p>"Son, I don't mind, but everyone has such high hopes for you! I don't want to let them down!" My father's expression was about the same as before, so I felt a little relieved.</p>
<p>But when the news that I was broke spread, the atmosphere immediately changed. The neighbors looked down on me, stopped praising me, and stopped making conversation. Although they didn't openly criticize me.</p>
<p>The environment became unbearable, and I desperately wanted to go out and wander again. But my God, where would I get the money for the journey? I timidly told my father a few days earlier, but he was struggling and couldn't raise the money. I knew my wealthy third brother wouldn't lend it to me, and certainly no one else would.</p>
<p>This time when I went home, no one invited me to dinner, and no one sent me a piece of salted meat. The reason was simple: because I had "excelled in learning but not served in office," and hadn't brought back any money, their hearts had all turned cold.</p>
<p>Alas, these terrible, opportunistic eyes!</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Patriotic Vendor 警愚 <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>"Want some five-spice beef? ... Want some five-spice beef? ..." This was Beef Ah Bing's slogan for attracting customers to his business.</p>
<p>He had been in this business for nearly ten years, and his experience was very rich. The beef he cooked was always fragrant and delicious! Therefore, he was deeply praised by customers and earned the honorific title of "Beef."</p>
<p>Although he was just a small vendor, his patriotism was no less than anyone else's. He himself was illiterate and couldn't read newspapers, but he loved to ask people about current events. When he learned that Japan had occupied Manchuria the previous year, he was extremely indignant! When the Shanghai Incident broke out, he became even more furious, his eyes almost popping out of his head! He immediately destroyed all the inferior goods he had at home! And he urged people to boycott them! Now that he knows that Yu Pass has fallen again and Rehe is in danger, he is even more enraged and cannot be suppressed! He is making even greater efforts to promote the boycott of Japanese goods!</p>
<p>He doesn't have a shop, he just carries a basket and shouts his wares along the street. When he meets a customer, after the transaction is complete, he takes the opportunity to describe the rampant behavior of the Japanese devils and urges them to put patriotism first and stop buying inferior goods! He speaks with such passion and eloquence that many listeners are moved.</p>
<p>His eating utensils are very simple: just a bamboo basket and two porcelain bowls, one for beef and one for beef tendon. However, the two bowls are different in quality. One is smaller and is definitely Jiangxi porcelain, a domestic product. The other is larger, with a white background and blue edges, and looks just like an enemy product. He was in the middle of giving a lecture to a customer when a young man who looked like a student suddenly held up the large porcelain bowl and looked at the bottom, saying strangely, "Isn't this bowl also an inferior product?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! The Western writing printed on the bottom of this bowl clearly indicates it's a Western product."</p>
<p>"You're the one talking nonsense! It's clearly printed as a product of the enemy country."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Who would lie to you?"</p>
<p>"Then how can an inferior product be printed with Western writing?"</p>
<p>"Western writing can be used freely; don't you see that the cigarette companies run by Chinese people also print Western writing on their boxes and cans?"</p>
<p>At this point, he seemed to understand something and immediately showed a look of deep disgust! He then found a lotus leaf, wrapped up the remaining beef he had for sale, and smashed the porcelain bowl into pieces with great force!</p>
<h3 id="e100">Several Principles of "Fearing Your Wife Will Surely Bring Wealth" 端父 <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>As the saying goes: "Fearing your wife will surely bring wealth." This is an absolutely true maxim. I didn't understand the reason before. I thought about it for a full twenty-four hours, and suddenly had an epiphany like the Buddha. It turns out that in modern society, the great men in politics, the leaders in business, and the giants in academia, the friends who fear their wives, have all risen to prominence, become wealthy and prosperous, and become fat and happy old men. At the same time, the friends who have risen to prominence, the fat and happy old men, although they seem to be bossy, awe-inspiring, and have life and death in their hands, when the truth is revealed, aren't they all like Chen Jichang, kneeling in front of the dressing table? This kind of fact has become a law in modern society. It's really wonderful and unbelievable. I have now discovered the principle behind it, which is very valuable. Even Newton's discovery of gravity and Einstein's discovery of relativity are no more significant than my achievement. Now I will prove the principle as follows: (1) Understanding the art of dealing with the world The art of dealing with the world is more spirited than any practice of the art of dealing with the world, so the result is becoming a famous person in society, but here comes the but, famous people, at first, fear their wives because of practicing the art of dealing with the world, but later have succeeded, why are they still afraid of their wives? The reason is: (1) Because of the accumulated weight is difficult to reverse, the power of the wife has been expanded, of course, it is not easy to reduce; otherwise, the prestige is issued, is it not about face, the so-called "not afraid of the wife, it is" seeking peace, "is the reason. (2) After becoming a rich man, of course, want to ask for an aunt, the joy of the flesh, secretly, afraid of the housewife know, this is a reason for the rich man to fear his wife.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am not a gold worshipper, but I feel the importance of money now. My family does not need me to send money home to support them, but after providing me with a high school education, they have no more strength to take care of me. After that, my marriage and all the expenses of my future small family will inevitably be taken care of by myself. I now have more than thirty yuan a month, and eating and living are provided by others, thinking about it myself, I should always be able to have a surplus every month; but in fact it is not so, not only no savings, but also very tight after the twentieth of each month. The most amazing thing is that last year my income was only twenty yuan a month, but now it has increased by more than ten yuan, but I don't see a wider range of use. What is the reason for this? (The following omitted)</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong respectfully</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Money in hand, food in mouth, it must be used. It is not easy for a person to feel the difference between spending more than ten yuan a month and saving more than ten yuan. The reason is that people's desires are never satisfied. Zhang Jun's current situation, with no family burden and lodging provided by others, means that twenty yuan a month is enough. Therefore, we believe that Zhang Jun should deposit at least ten yuan in the savings bank every month after receiving his salary, no matter what, it should not be used. In the first few months, don't disdain it because the amount is too small, and later it will become a habit: and as the savings increase, you will be interested in seeing the amount in the passbook, and consider saving as the only pleasure. Generally speaking, anything will feel boring at the beginning, but when it becomes a habit, you will enjoy it. Saving is also like this.</p>

<p>Peter walked alone on the street. Although he was familiar with every crack in the road, every telephone pole, and every house, he felt only astonishment in the cold light. The noise of the crowd, the sound of car horns, and the clanging of trams did not warm his lifeless dream. He looked at the end of the street to the south, where it connected to the railway, directly opposite the Pessani station. The 8 o'clock train from Pottorsville was about to arrive. There was a prison in Pottorsville. This train often brought many city officials and judges back to their homes in the city.</p>
<p>Peter felt extremely lonely walking on the street. His joints ached. The fashionable lawyers and doctors, although walking on the same road as him, seemed to be in another world and had nothing to do with them. A smug look was written on their fat faces. Peter saw their happiness and felt even more isolated from the outside world. He only felt that he belonged to the Tralbo Coal Mine? His number in the mine was 1665. This number was deeply imprinted on his mind. He was always just a number! Even in the crowded crowd on this Saturday night. No matter where he went, the coal mine seemed to follow him forever. The shadows in the mine often loomed in his heart.</p>
<p>The vast ball field was brightly lit. Well-dressed, modern young men in the city sat leisurely in the shoeshine chairs. The waiters, who only earned small tips, were diligently polishing their shoes. The air was filled with the noise of calculating baseball scores and commenting on the merits of boxing. At the same time, the sound of dice came from the back room, and the sound of balls also leaked out from the crack in the door.</p>
<p>Peter looked at the cigars in the box. He chose a cigar he liked, bit off the end, and lit it on the alcohol lamp. The fragrance slowly descended into his lungs, and then slowly rose up again, pleasantly circulating from his nostrils. He was stimulated by this exciting aroma. A cigar reduced his loneliness. His mind seemed to relax a bit! He gradually felt some meaning in life. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e104">Movie Special: Several Stars From Poor Backgrounds 兴之 <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Among the famous stars in Hollywood, only about 30% came from well-off families, while 70% came from poor families. This article describes some of the most famous and poorest of these 70%.</p>
<p>When Joan Crawford was a little girl, her mother was so poor that she couldn't afford to raise her, so she sent her to a small school in New York to work as a servant girl. In that school, she washed dishes, wiped tables, and mopped floors every day. She watched the playful students and her heart burned with envy. After working as a servant girl for two years, she begged her mother to let her study. At that time, her mother had saved more than ten dollars from her work. Although she was reluctant to spend it, she felt sorry for Joan who had never been to school, so she reluctantly allowed Joan to study. Joan studied for a year, but her mother no longer had the strength to support her schooling. From then on, she continued her life as a servant until she drifted to Hollywood and became a dancer in a dance hall, finally escaping her life as a servant.</p>
<p>Edward G. Robinson was originally from Italy. His father ran a free newspaper in Rome and served as its chief editor. At that time, the Italian revolution was taking place, and the free newspaper offended the revolutionaries. His father was expelled from the country, and Edward was only eleven years old when he followed his father to America. His father was destitute and became a milkman in a milk company in America. After working as a milkman for two years, he saved some money and started a newspaper in America to continue his unfinished ambition. At that time, Edward was only thirteen years old, exceptionally intelligent, and already able to write. His father asked him to write articles and paid him five cents a week. Edward's ambition was only to become a teacher or a missionary. He never expected to gain fame in the film industry.</p>
<p>William Boyd's father and brother died early, and William relied on his aunt's support to live. He turned thirteen and never stepped through the doors of a school because there was no money to. His aunt took out seven hundred dollars to send him to a drama school. Because his clothes were tattered, he was humiliated by his classmates. Only one classmate looked up to him, that being Li Que Dixi. Later, when Boyd graduated, Li Que could be considered his confidant.</p>
<p>Wallace Beery's father was a craftsman. Although he wasn't so poor that he had no food to eat, he was very hard-pressed. Wallace followed his father when he was a child, so he is now good at imitating characters from the lower classes when he acts.</p>
<p>Other stars like Lola La Plante, Jean Harlow, Carmel Myers, and Patsy Ruth Miller were all children of poor families, and now they have all made a fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Audience Opinion After Watching [Reunion] Winter <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Because I wanted to appreciate a new Russian film, I made a special trip from the countryside to Shanghai, but the [Life Route], which was unanimously praised by the audience, had already been shown. What I saw was [Reunion]. I believe that new Russian films will definitely give us some new perspectives, and their films are definitely not for the purpose of making a profit.</p>
<p>After watching [Reunion], on a night in early spring with rain and snow, it did give me a lot of new understanding. I believe I did not waste my trip.</p>
<p>Since Utroff's realistic film movement caused a great sensation, new Russian films have broken away from all the old heritage of the film industry and started a new step. Their new films use editing, and they abandon ideal scripts, artificial backgrounds, etc., allowing filmmakers to capture real scenes anytime and anywhere, and then try to connect them to form a new creation. [Reunion] was made using the editing method. Because they are new and unseen, some people may not be used to watching them, but this is just a matter of not being used to it.</p>
<p>The content of [Reunion] is roughly about a revolutionary leader who sacrificed his life for the revolution and for industrial construction. He is dead, but the construction of the revolution cannot be stopped, and all undertakings are proceeding rapidly. However, in the process of this construction, there are still many hidden worries, which often hinder the progress of our revolution. But it doesn't matter, will can overcome all emotional mistakes and keep the revolution from ever going off its correct path. Finally, it shows us that the five-year plan was finally completed in four years.</p>
<p>We must not criticize this new film within the old scope. Because this is the truth, they do not lie at all, they tell us the real situation in New Russia.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Review of Reunion 玉虹 <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>I have not seen [Life Route], so I cannot compare it with [Reunion]. However, under the residual power of the great reputation of Life Route, Reunion seems to be inferior.</p>
<p>The fact of this film is that a Soviet Russian revolutionary leader faints during a celebration of the success of the five-year plan because he recalls the hardships of the revolution in the past. Later, he goes to the Black Sea to recuperate and recalls the process of participating in the war in the past. He also visits his old friend and discovers that a female spy of a rebel party, who had escaped twelve years ago, is still continuing her destructive work at his friend's place!</p>
<p>In terms of sentimentality, except for Mouzalevsky, the rest are very bland. The actions of the female spy after escaping and the ironclad vehicle resisting the enemy in the middle of the journey are too slow and cannot express the tense situation at that time!</p>
<p>There are no brilliant techniques, and because more than half of the film is derived from [recollections], the director has to take care of the reflection of the past and also express the current expression, so it is quite chaotic.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that all theaters should pay more attention to Chinese subtitles, especially for Russian and German films. Because although there are many people who know English now, there are very few who know Russian and German, so detailed subtitles should be added to important conversations and joints in the film, otherwise, even in small places, the spirit and meaning of the whole film will be lost.</p>

<p>The sound blockbuster [Spring Breeze and Willow Branches] by Da Dong Company was filmed using a radio receiver manufactured by Mr. Zhu Qingxian of Hehe Company. The play depicts the various lives of male and female college students and is extremely capable of highlighting the merits. It is directed by Mr. Wang Fuqing, who also plays the leading role. Mr. Wang has the earliest history in the field of domestic films. The [Good Brothers] film published by Commercial Press ten years ago was directed by Junren, with Yang Naimei as the heroine, followed by Xia Peizhen, Hu Jia, Chen Yitang, Han Lungen, etc. The sound and songs are also extremely clear and loud. It is said that it will be released in major theaters in the area in the near future, and it is foreseeable that it will cause a sensation in the area.</p>

<p>Since Von Sternberg went to India, Marlene Dietrich declared to Paramount that she would terminate her contract. Because she did not fulfill her contractual obligations, Paramount filed a lawsuit, demanding that Dietrich pay 182,850 yuan in compensation. When the lawsuit was in progress, Von Sternberg had returned to Hollywood and agreed to continue directing Dietrich's films. As a result, Paramount withdrew the lawsuit and apologized to Dietrich. Dietrich has now continued her work.</p>

<p>Thanks from Chung Sze to the British Military Commander</p>
<p>The Land Artillery Unit of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps recently went to Hong Kong for live-fire exercises from January 29th to February 3rd. The British Army Artillery Commander in China provided assistance throughout. The exercise has now concluded and the unit has returned to Shanghai. According to a report sent to the Merchant Corps Commander by British military staff Colonel North Wauchope, all members of the unit were highly skilled and orderly during the exercise. This exercise was very valuable, and he hopes that arrangements can be made to continue it in the future. Chung Sze, Director-General of the Public Works Department, sent a letter to the British military commander yesterday, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the Board of Directors and the Merchant Corps Commander for the training received and the hospitality extended.</p>

<p>Anhui Qianshan County Junior High School, considering the bloody battles of the Northeastern Volunteer Army and the reported lack of military provisions, believed that people in the rear should find ways to help. Therefore, at the end of last year, they held a variety show and raised more than 480 yuan. As the funds have not yet been fully collected, they have first remitted 299 yuan, and the remainder will be remitted to Shanghai upon collection. A detailed explanation was provided in a letter from Zhang Shaoliang, the school principal. This is recorded to highlight their enthusiasm.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Shareholders' Meeting of the China General Edison Company <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The American China General Edison Company held its seventh annual shareholders' meeting on February 27, 1933, at the company's office in Shanghai. Mr. Sadler, a director of the company, presided over the meeting and announced the following to the shareholders: [According to the scheduled time today (4:30 PM)]</p>
<p>Shareholders and shareholder representatives present, totaling 39,5021 shares, exceeded the legal quorum. The company secretary was asked to read the notice of the shareholders' meeting first. The company's financial statements have already been sent to all of you. If you permit, I will consider them as read. I would like to inform you that the directors of the company felt that 1932 was a significant test of the company's stable business policy, namely, to do its best to maintain the fluidity of funds and to engage in the real estate business purely to earn commissions. From the outbreak of war in January 1932 until the end of the year, the real estate business was extremely stagnant, and bank deposits tended to be excessive. However, at the end of 1932, the policy seemed to take a wait-and-see attitude. Based on the above-mentioned fluidity policy, the company never stood in the position of a distressed lender and was able to meet the needs of customers with ease. Therefore, the company's cash sources generally recognized that the company was not an illiquid asset, and regarding loans, before reporting on the status of other businesses, I would like to briefly state the facts of the well-known China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's 700,000 tael loan to this company, which I think you will be happy to hear about. For the past four years, this company has worked with the commissioners and supervisors appointed by the National Government, as well as the chairman of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the shipping industry, to study the plan to rescue and revitalize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The drafting and revision of all documents and contracts for this plan consumed countless hours and effort, and related personnel traveled to the United States several times because of this matter. The plan was finally finalized, and the contract was signed, so that the 700,000 tael temporary loan with sufficient collateral was also established, allowing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to overcome its financial crisis. However, unexpectedly, a few months after the signing of the contract, the National Government ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to be nationalized. It would be an understatement to say that this company was disappointed because this company felt that it had made every effort to offer a practical plan to rescue the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from its slump, and it felt that the goodwill it had gained from the Chinese people and government would greatly benefit the future of the China General Edison Company. This company has consistently provided economic assistance to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the past, and all pledges have been approved by the chairman of the company and the commissioners and supervisors appointed by the National Government, because according to Article 3 of the Supervisory Office's powers promulgated on March 26th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the supervisor has the power to implement all plans to revitalize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Item B of Article 5 has the power to approve and cancel all contract documents, and Item C of Article 5 has the power to approve all development projects and restructuring methods, etc. Regarding the 700,000 loan granted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, this company now holds the company's official receipt. At the same time, the company pledged the remaining value of all assets pledged to the two foreign banks to this company as collateral for the loan. The two foreign banks have also officially recognized this pledge. The value of the collateral is several times higher than 700,000. The underwriting rate for the loan bonds is 82.5 (including this company's 2.5% commission). Observing the rate in light of the chaotic financial crisis of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the underwriting rate cannot be considered unfair. Compared with the recent Shanghai Municipal Government's issuance of the reconstruction public bonds, the underwriting rate was 80%, and the wharf tax was used as collateral. It can be seen that the conditions agreed upon by this company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were not as unfair as the government thought. In addition, the collateral given to this company by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is far less guaranteed to repay interest and principal than the fixed income from the wharf tax. This is generally recognized by the public. As for purchasing new ships and flying the American flag before the price has been paid, this is not an unprecedented example. In 1931, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also purchased two Norwegian ships and paid a portion of the cash first. Before the full price was paid, the two ships still flew the Norwegian flag. This company believes that the contract signed is extremely fair and beneficial to both the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the China General Edison Company. If the government thinks otherwise, then no matter how great the undertaking, this company is unwilling to do it if it affects the feelings of the Chinese people and government. After informal discussions, this matter will not cause any problems or may be resolved peacefully in the near future. In 1932, even in the midst of the recession, this company was still able to pay bondholders an 8% weekly interest rate and propose to distribute a 1% dividend. The directors of this company have unlimited confidence in the future of this company and feel that the policy adopted by this company has proven to be effective, so this company can always obtain benefits no matter how difficult the period. I will now no longer state the comparison of accounts and the progress made in 1932, so as not to waste your precious time. The above-mentioned events are all detailed in the printed annual meeting report, which will be sent by mail. At that time, please read it carefully. Resolution 1: I propose that all of the 1932 business report and financial statement, and the 10% (i.e., one tael per share) dividend for 1932, be approved by all of you present. This one tael per share dividend is equivalent to one cent of interest per year. In addition, there is a remaining balance of 263,520.27 taels, which is proposed to be transferred to the next year's surplus account. The directors of this company believe that all shareholders will be satisfied with this because the Shanghai industry in 1932 mostly fell into a recession. Rong Shangqian seconded, passed. Resolution 2: From the balance of 80,488.66 taels exceeding the par value of the share capital from the previous year, the following items should be removed: The discount of 75,915.40 yuan for bonds from 1931 to 1941. The remaining amount is 4,573.2 yuan. Zhong Kecheng seconded, passed. Resolution 3: Proposed by S.E. Sevy, seconded by Rong Shangqian, the following retiring directors should still be elected as directors for the next term: F.W. Sutterle Sadler, A. Loonig Loonis, F.W. Sutterlelr W.A. Adams Adam, Y.T. Lin Lin Yuting, J.B. Davies Davis. Resolution 4: Proposed by J.B. Davieg, seconded by W.A. Adams, the following amendments were passed. Amendment to Article 4a of the by-laws as follows: The company's fiscal year will be from January 1 to December 31, and the annual shareholders' meeting should be convened in the shortest possible time after the closing of the various accounts, the auditor's review, and the drafting of the financial report, ready for submission to the shareholders, but not later than March 1 each year. At that time, the shareholders will elect two directors for the coming year by majority vote. A quorum of 10% of the shares issued by the company is required for the election and resolution of various matters, except for matters stipulated in Article 10 of the American Commercial Law. According to that commercial law, a resolution must be passed by a two-thirds vote to be effective. Amendments to Article 5a and Article 5b of the by-laws as follows: (a) The company's assets and business shall be managed and operated by a board of directors consisting of at least three directors. The number of directors' seats shall at all times be a majority of American citizens. At the company's annual meeting each year, the two directors who have served the company the longest shall automatically retire, and their vacancies shall be filled by the election of new directors in accordance with Article 4a of the by-laws. In addition, retiring directors are still eligible to be elected at the current or subsequent shareholders' meetings. If there are more than two directors with the same term of office and it is not possible to decide or agree on which two should retire, the decision shall be made by drawing lots. (b) The board of directors may, at regular or special meetings, elect to fill vacancies in the board, and the new directors shall serve until the next shareholders' meeting or until their successors have been elected and reviewed and qualified, passed. Resolution 5: Proposed by W.A. Adamg, seconded by S.E. Sevy, it is proposed to hire Mortimer Peidg Slee, an accountant, as the company's auditor for 1933, passed.</p>

<p>Seventeen Workshops Destroyed, Losses Amounting to Eighty Thousand</p>
<p>The Company Resolves to Provide Generous Burials in the Aftermath</p>
<p>At 11:40 AM yesterday, an electrical fire suddenly broke out in the coating room of the First Factory of the Yonghe Industrial Company, located at the intersection of Sanyang Road and the end of Xibaoxing Road in Zhabei, causing the explosion of a steaming vat in the drying room. After the fire brigades of various sections made every effort to extinguish the fire, it was completely extinguished by 2:30 PM. A total of seventeen workshops were burned down, fifteen female workers in the manufacturing room and four male workers in the coating room were burned to death, thirty-two people were injured, and the loss was approximately 80,000 yuan. The factory had undergone factory inspections by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the equipment was thorough; otherwise, the loss would have been even greater, and more people would have been killed or injured.</p>
<h3 id="e114">History of the Factory <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Yonghe Industrial Company was founded in the seventh year of the Republic of China by the three brothers of Mr. Ye Zhongting, specializing in the manufacture of cosmetics, inks, and rubber products, with a capital of 120,000 yuan. The wholesale department was located on Minzhu Street, Old North Gate. During the January 28th Incident, the main factory on Sanyang Road, Xibaoxing Road, was partially destroyed by Japanese bombing. After the war ended, the cosmetics and ink departments were moved to Route Robert, West Shanghai, and a second factory was established. The main factory on Sanyang Road was renamed the First Factory, specializing in the manufacture of rubber products, and a retail department was added at Sanyangjing Bridge.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Location of the Factory Buildings <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The first building of the First Factory on Sanyang Road is a new building, which houses the offices and has been destroyed by Japanese bombing. The second building is an old-style bungalow, which serves as a dormitory and now houses the factory offices. The flat-roofed building at the beginning houses the workers' dormitory. The third building is the workshop, which is also a bungalow. The coating room and drying room, a total of five rooms, are located at the south end and equipped with four steaming vats. The ball room and shoe-making room, a total of seven rooms, are located north of the drying room, separated by a fifteen-inch wall. Behind is the car shop. The raw materials room and warehouse are located at the north end. The factory has a total of 160 male workers and 324 female workers. The factory has undergone factory inspections by the Social Affairs Bureau and is considered to be well-equipped. The steaming vats in the drying room are all new-style domestic products and are equipped with safety devices. When the steam pressure exceeds 40 pounds, the safety device can automatically release steam to prevent explosion. There are many emergency exits. The entire factory is insured for 260,000 yuan. Workers are divided into day and night shifts. Female workers with better skills can earn 1.5 yuan per day, and ordinary workers can also earn 70 to 80 cents, which is better than the treatment in other factories. The day shift starts at 9:00 AM and ends at 6:00 PM after lunch at 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Electrical Fire <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>At 11:40 AM yesterday, just as it was time for the workers to leave work for lunch, an electrical fire suddenly broke out on the corner tower of the coating room in the third workshop, spreading to the paints and calenders used for coating under the corner tower, causing it to spread rapidly. The steaming vats in the drying room were compressed by the high heat, causing three cylinders to explode one after another. The factory building collapsed.</p>

Lawyer Wu plans to visit Consul General Meyrier within days to inquire about his resolution policy for this case. Mr. Wu's opinions are: (1) Regarding the public prosecution, the police should file a lawsuit with the judicial authorities of the French Consulate. (2) Regarding the private prosecution, the family members of the deceased can file a lawsuit demanding compensation. On the one hand, they can ask the municipal government to consult with the French Consul General to discuss a proper solution to achieve a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>Investigation Process</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai, for the matter of the tragic case of Zhu Gutin being shot and killed by Vietnamese police in the French Concession, at the urging of the deceased's family members, specially convened an emergency meeting at the association yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Hundreds of people attended. First, Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu reported the reasons for the meeting, followed by Zhu Guting's elder brother, Zhu Guhan, reporting the details of the tragic case of the Vietnamese police deliberately shooting and killing his brother. The investigation situation roughly stated that after being assigned to investigate the case of the Vietnamese police shooting and killing his fellow villager Zhu Gutin, he immediately went to the scene of the incident in front of the Ningbo Restaurant on Xinqiao Street to investigate. According to nearby merchants, at 1:15 PM on the 25th of this month, a Vietnamese policeman, No. 427, interfered because two women were riding in a rickshaw, violating the police regulations. They argued with each other. At that time, more and more passers-by stopped to watch. The policeman drove them away, but they did not disperse, so he raised his gun and fired at the crowd, firing several shots, killing Zhu Gutin on the spot, injuring Liu Fugao, and two unnamed people. Liu Fugao also died of his injuries that evening. The two corpses were at Tongren Fuyuantang yesterday (i.e., the 26th), and the second special district local court prosecutor was reported to the place to examine them. Zhu Gutin was shot through the chest and back, and Liu Fugao was shot through the abdomen. The unnamed two people were injured in their hands and feet and went to the hospital for treatment, etc. Set up an Assistance Association</p>
<p>Subsequently, legal advisors Wu Kaisheng and Guo Qiming conducted concrete discussions on the legal issues and procedures for the case. Finally, the entire meeting decided to establish an assistance committee for the Zhu case, and immediately elected Zheng Shixiong, Huang Tianpeng, Zheng Meian, Li Jinzhen, Zheng Yingshi, and other seventeen people as members, and sent letters to the city's party and government organs, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and fellow townsmen's associations in Shanghai to request unanimous assistance. At the end of the meeting, four representatives were elected to participate in the Liu case support association of the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai. Ningbo People Gather to Discuss</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai convened an executive committee yesterday for the case of the Vietnamese police shooting and killing Chinese people to discuss and seek further effective countermeasures. After discussion, it was resolved to: (1) hire lawyer Dai Jinghuai to study legal issues; (2) send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession to protest to the French Concession Public Works Department, to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderers, providing compensation, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur in the future; (3) if necessary, unite with various groups to take action; (4) secretly, it was heard that the association will suggest to the Chaozhou Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai to organize a support association for the tragedy. Nearby residents are all terrified. The female workers in the ball room and shoe-making room rushed out of the factory, crying and screaming. The order was in chaos. Those who fled later were all crushed by the collapsed walls and buried in the fire.</p>
<p>Making Every Effort to Rescue The Zhabei Fourth Section Fire Brigade of Xibaoxing Road was the first to hear the alarm and rushed to the rescue. The Fifth District Police Department of the Public Security Bureau also dispatched a police officer to lead the police to rush to the scene to suppress the chaos. Before long, fire trucks from other sections also arrived. In addition to putting out the fire, they also worked hard to rescue the workers from danger. Most of the workers in the factory had already rushed to the open space outside the factory gate. The fire brigade rescued 32 workers who had been burned and sent them to Renji Hospital on Shandong Road and Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. The fire was completely extinguished at 2:30 PM. A total of seventeen rooms were burned down, including five coating and drying rooms, five shoe-making rooms, and seven ball rooms.</p>

<p>The deceased workers are all placed in the factory. The local court will send a prosecutor to examine the corpses this morning. The Fifth District Police Department of the Public Security Bureau has dispatched police to guard the factory. The Yonghe Company has decided to issue five pieces of silk funerary clothing to each deceased worker, purchase coffins from the Jiangyin Public Office for burial at a price of 60 yuan each, and prepare a large number of silk cotton funerary quilts. After the local court examines the corpses today, the Jiangyin Public Office will be entrusted to handle the burial, notify the families to claim the bodies, and set up a temporary reception center for the families of the victims. It will also hold a ceremony to pray for the deceased workers.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Three People Die from Eating Puffer Fish Roe <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Fish Roe Picked Up from the Wharf</p>
<p>Three Die and Three are Injured After Abdominal Distension</p>
<p>Wu Xiaosanzi, Li Dehai, Xu Dake, Sun Jintang, etc., all from Jiangbei, came to Shanghai to escape famine. They had nowhere to live, so they begged in the streets during the day and slept in the alleys at night. Recently, they built a small shed in a small alley in Shiliupu, Nanshi, as a place to sleep, and covered the four sides of the shed with straw mats to shelter from the wind and rain. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, Wu and others picked up a lot of fish roe on the wharf, brought it back to the shed, cooked it in a pot, and ate it with a woman surnamed Mao and an unknown person. Because it tasted very good, the cooked fish roe was quickly eaten. Unexpectedly, this fish roe was all from puffer fish. Therefore, after entering the abdomen, it immediately began to swell, and because they had eaten too much, it was difficult to digest, so before long, all six people shouted abdominal pain and fell to the ground rolling around. Passers-by noticed this and immediately took them to the Nanshi Hospital of the Red Cross for treatment. Under the separate treatment of doctors Zhang Jianxiong and others in the hospital, Xu Dake, Sun Jintang, and the woman surnamed Mao recovered because they had eaten less. However, Wu Xiaosanzi, Li Dehai, and an unknown person died because of severe poisoning. The hospital reported the situation to the district chief of the first district. Because the matter concerned human lives, he ordered Lu Yongde, the local head of Shiliupu, to report it to the Shanghai Local Court for an examination. At about 5:00 PM, appointed prosecutor Cao Changlin, along with examiners, arrived at the scene and examined the corpses of Wu Xiaosanzi, Li Dehai, and the unidentified person, etc., and determined that all three had died of puffer fish roe poisoning before death. Since there were no family members of the deceased, the district chief was ordered to report to the authorities for burial. After the examination, they returned to the hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Two Assassins of Wu Guangzong Sentenced to Death <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Remaining Two Accomplices Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wu Guangzong, the director of the Naval Survey Bureau, who lived in Ningkangli, Ximen, was stabbed to death by bandits who broke into his house. Later, four criminals, Wu Jigui, Zhang Shaoliang, Zhang Changlin, and Zong Jiande, were arrested by the inspectors of the concession. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau brought them back to the case and transferred them to the local court. After repeated preliminary hearings by the prosecutor, the defendants confessed to premeditated murder and were prosecuted. After a final argument in the criminal court, Judge Shen Youqi, accompanied by clerk Cao Yaoting, opened the court to pronounce the sentence at 3:00 PM yesterday. The defendants, all in shackles, were brought to court. The interrogator announced the main text of the judgment: Wu Jigui and Zhang Shaoliang were each sentenced to death, Zhang Changlin and Song Jiande were each sentenced to life imprisonment, and all were deprived of their civil rights for life. After the sentence was pronounced, the bailiffs were ordered to take them back into custody to await execution.</p>
