<p>國際聯盟大會會議塲上。我中國代表顧維鈞發舒正論。認爲「遠東時局處於極度黑暗之中。而一年以來尤爲國聯成立迄今最令人失望之一年。不宣而戰之戰爭。日本破壞國聯盟約。巴黎非戰公約。及九國公約之舉。中國未能以隻手阻止侵略者之兇燄。……然中國决定維持其所有權利。决不承認或默認非法的旣成事實。中國自信。不獨欲保持土地之完整。抑且抵抗彼破壞國聯盟約使成廢紙之謀也。」此種議論。匪僅阐明我中國之立塲。且對國聯之不能實施其决議案。運用盟約第十六條以制裁暴行。亦深致惋惜。復又進一步發爲警告。謂」陰霾正起於遠東之國際天空。軍備競爭。業已開始。海軍空軍大規模之操演。艦隊之集中。與軍費之激增。相繼實現。……此皆數年内將發生大戰之朕兆。」此又爲一般社會所確認之事實。在歐西諸國或不免爲日人之宣傳所蒙而吾親身嘗受之國人實覺其言之深切動人也。</p>
<p>遠東危機。即在乎日本軍國主義者瘋狂之行動。無從遏止。今其對我且借口於方吉軍之變。灤東土匪之擾亂。而暗中活動。其違背華北恊定。人所共睹。乃反以我于學忠軍之入灤東爲藐視恊定行動。豈不可怪。又日自簽訂恊定後。延不撤兵而且增兵。今又有東京第一師團與大阪第四師團抽調勁旅來華之訊。是其行動。非僅違背恊定。且破壞國際間一切公約。亦可想見。乃日人反責爲我國聯代表顧維鈞之演說爲違反恊定精神。是可知日軍閥覬觎華北之野心。尙未知其有何底止。此即爲遠東危機之大原因也。</p>
<p>自日本軍部重視一九三六年之後。陸海軍雙方。均曾明白表示。增加軍備。出於勢所不得已。其决心不顧華盛頓條約及倫敦海軍條約。已成旣定的事實。其建築小笠原島之要塞也。力爭代管加洛林羣島也。逐處顯示其包圍菲利濱。南窥澳洲。西侵印度之情勢。而所謂「道理外交」之廣田弘毅。乃欲乘此時機。打開日本退出國際聯盟以來之孤立。表面上雖力倡親美之論。實則不過欲就此打破英美對遠東問題之聯合戰線。運用其外交上之縱横術。以减少日本之敵人。便於作戰而已。然而英美亦决不肯受其愚弄。美國在產業復興過程中。正努力於克服經濟恐慌。猶不忽視日本之所謂第二次補充海軍計劃。而决定添造大小軍艦三十九艘。近且表明决不中止。直謂爲日本好戰所引起可也。英國對日經濟關係之惡化。早已顯然。西姆拉會議縱令成功。亦不過略爲延遲其衝突之時日而已。况乎議會之决無效果。亦可預測。此又遠東危機之一原因也。</p>
<p>至於日蘇間之形勢。自中東路出賣問題失敗後。蘇聯已一反從前沉默。之態度。對日迭發警告。而日亦已承認充實軍備之企圖。因爲蘇聯備堅强之故。謂「蘇聯陸軍常備兵力有一百二十九萬。飛機二千二百架。即屯駐沿海濱省及遠東各地之赤軍。數逾十師。坦克車飛機。都數百架。其轟炸機不難飛炸日本之重要都市。」是則日人眼中。以蘇聯爲最重要之敵人。而急急於「日滿航空」之開始。横渡日本海飛行之舉。已於本年九月二十九日升空起飛。我入觀蘇日兩方之劍拔弩張。積極準備軍事之態度。又可知遠東危機愈益迫切矣。</p>
<p>綜觀世界情勢之危險如此。則顧維鈞之大聲疾呼。謂陰霾正起於遠東之國際天空。爲數年内將發生大戰之朕兆。絕非故作驚人之語。世界人士。不應共同警惕之耶。</p>

<p>西姆拉　昨日日印會商、日本方面所提、關於棉製品之提案内容、確聞如何、（一）七成半之關税、依六月提高前、减低至五成、（一）印度若承認該减低、日本亦根據互讓妥恊之精神、準備考慮下列各點、甲、日本必購買一定數量之印棉、乙、若因日本棉布無統制之輸出、與印度國内之產業、有威脅時、日本實行輸出統制、以防止之、日本方面所要求、將七成半之棉布關税、應减爲五成之理由、大體如下、（一）印度關税非收入關税、而爲保護關税、故由此見地、設定對英二成半、對日七成半、而有五成之差、實屬不當、宜賦同率關税、（一）雖考慮日金之低廉、日英間有五成之差、不能不謂爲不當、緣棉布之原價其成份爲原棉價六成與加工費四成、故由對英匯兌、低四成之現狀觀之、日本之棉布、四成（加工費）之四成、即原價之一成六、較英貨爲廉、若加入渥太涯關税恊定所規定、一成之差别關税、爲二成六時、日本尙可忍耐、緣依此計算、對於英貨爲二成半、而日貨爲五成一故也、（一日電通電）</p>

<p>日俄兩國備戰益急進</p>
<p>駐哈俄總領奉召回國</p>
<p>長春通訊、蘇聯政府在東北邊境、已積極擴張軍備、以爲對日作戰之準備、日方曁僞國當局、甚爲注意、僞外交部特擬具大綱、將與俄劃定國界、以防俄軍前進、惟蘇聯對此事、絕不退讓、恐將增加糾紛、茲探誌僞國對俄提出之劃定界線大綱·及俄僞爭執要點如下、</p>
<p>僞國提出之大綱、由西部滿洲里至阿爾袞河·通黑龍江之烏蘇里江·及東部俄僞國境線現况、大體硍據一八六○年北京條約者、其後如興凱湖條約、（一八六一年）漠河金礦事件、（一八八五年）琿春界約、（一八八六年）春匪事件、（一九○○年）齊齊哈爾恊定、（一九一一年）哈埠議定書（一九二九年）等、僞國認爲以上恊定、均爲中國被壓迫而默認者、擬改正恊定方法、分爲兩點、（一）根據加拉罕宣言、廢棄舊俄帝政時代之諸舊條約、即恢復一六八九年之條約是也、因此俄僞國境、北至夫逹諾鮑伊山脈、東至沿海洲逹於日本海、（二）依據從來諸條約、大體之國境、先爲决定、故在其範圍内、須據地的恊定、確認僞國境線、關於上述恊定問題、尤爲俄僞重要爭執點、（一）烏江江口三角洲問題、在北京條約上認爲中國領土者、爲軍事的重要之地點、而蘇俄在現在</p>
<p>已隨意稱爲自國領土、（二）江東六十四屯問題、由里牙河口至夫爾毛金屯在蘇俄領土内之地區、依據阿伊袞條約、爲確認僞國行政權、（三）西部滿洲里問題、依據齊齊哈爾恊定、已完畢細目的恊定、惟中俄紛爭之際、蘇俄已試其實力進入中國領土、僞國要求退於恊定線、（四）最近蘇俄擴張軍備於極東國境、日僞認爲確有備戰之準備、俄僞國交當益漸裂痕、日僞在此期間、亦做防備云、</p>
<p>日俄軍備旣漸積極、雙方交涉、决無圓滿之可能、最近日人在哈逮捕東路俄工務員、亦爲向俄决裂之表示、蘇聯駐哈總領事司拉夫次斯基、於上月二十三日午　三時二十五分、搭乘哈滿第三次通車附掛之第三號專車、隻身仇遽北上、東鐵理監事會·俄人理監事·及路局局長魯德義等二十餘人、均至車站歡迎、車站站長特開貴賓室欵待、據司拉夫次斯基對護照檢查員聲稱、係奉召回國、惟當此蘇俄一切問題、交涉緊張之際、司拉夫次基突然離哈回國、殊極惹各方之注意耳、（東北社）</p>

<p>黄逕行返平主持華北政務</p>
<p>曾仲鳴唐有壬亦聯袂返京</p>
<p>黄談華北施政在振作人心</p>
<p>行政院長汪精衛、此次來滬、訪晤宋子文·黄郛、商洽中央及華北財政等各項問題、均已商定相當辦法、原定昨晨返京、旋因延德醫諾爾、於上午七時、到寓診病、須稍行休息、昨晚十一時、始偕鐵道部次長曾仲鳴等、乘夜車附掛花車返京平整委會委員長黄郛亦同行、逕返北平、主持政務、各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>黄郛北上　汪氏日前訪晤黄郛、商决華北各項政務、並促其早日北上、黄氏當即允諾同車晋京、黄即北上、昨午汪宅特電知路局、預備PMCL-2花車兩輛、附掛十一時夜車、備兩氏乘坐、北站及眞茹車站、則由路警及保安隊等嚴密戒備、兩路局副局長吳紹曾、處長莫衡、工務局長沈怡、均在站歡送、並照料一切、黄郛於十時四十分、偕隨員六人到站、登二號花車、延見歡送之吳副局長等、市長吳鐵城偕秘書長俞鴻鈞隨到、亦登車晤談、俞氏先下車、吳市長則隨車至眞茹、以便歡送汪院長、至十一時正、汽笛一聲、車緩行離站、</p>
<p>汪亦返京　詎車行未遠、汪院長偕鐵次曾仲鳴、適於斯時抵站、站守揚紅燈停車、汪氏乃登一號花車、吳市長亦出二號花車、與汪氏握手送行、當列車突然停止時、人聲雜擾、乘客不明原因、均探首窗外探視、汪氏登車後、乘客方歸座、列車乃又緩緩開出、昨夜晋京者、尙有唐有壬·朱家驊·及王揖唐等、</p>
<p>黄氏談話　黄郛於昨晨十時、在寓接見記者、據談、關於華北財政問題、本人自與行政院汪院長、財政部宋部長等迭次商洽後刻已完全解决、嗣後華北一切收入、全部彙解中央、聽候處置、不再由地方自行支配、俾全國財政、得以統一、黄氏繼談整理華北政務之步驟、其最重要者爲下列兩點、第一即安定人心、茲華北人心業已漸趨穏定、此後則當變爲振作人心、第二爲設法安定經濟、蓋以華北處此政治及種種情况之下、經濟之安定、實爲目前唯一之先决問題、如經濟方面未能得有安定、則其他一切、將無從着手整理云云、</p>

<p>軍政費月不敷千萬</p>
<p>宋宅會商先事救急</p>
<p>整個問題尙待長議</p>
<p>立法院長孫科、昨晨九時、在寓接見各報社記者、談前晨宋宅會議之内容、謂目下中央每月軍政費與預算不敷、竟逹千萬元之巨、財政當局、以籌劃困難、政治當局、則以目下裁員减政、已减無可减、而軍事當局、則以值茲剿匪軍事積極進行時、軍費支出、殊不能稍緩、故各方確有萬不得已之苦衷、前晨會商結果、已有救濟辦法、惟僅能應付暫時之局面、永久之計、尙有待於從長之討論、及减少軍費支出、孫氏又答記者問、謂孔祥熙氏前日下午飛贛謁蔣之任務、本人不得而知、惟悉孔氏早擬前往、嗣以事延至昨日（即前日）始啓程、至蔣夫人宋美齡女士來滬、亦未負有若何使命云、</p>

<p>上海市市長吳鐵城、奉令兼代淞滬警備司令、吳氏已於今晨十時、前往警備司令部視事、據聞吳氏以此次出任警備司令、原屬暫行兼代性質、故暫不正式就職、惟在舉行紀念週後、接見全體職員、吳氏對於警部職員、並無更動、以資熟手、</p>

<p>中央社云、本市臨時市參議會議長史量才·曁全體議員杜月笙·等、忽於前日會議中、提出總辭職、中央社記者特以此事、叩訽市長吳鐵城、據吳氏表示、臨時市參議會成立於去歲十月中旬、當該會成立之初、曾聲明以一年爲期、計算該會成立迄今、瞬將一載、故該會諸議員、爰有提出總辭職之舉、但按諸該會組織條例、應至民選市參議會正式成立之時、方爲任滿之期、故市府對於臨時市參議會之總辭職、决請中央挽留、至於復興公債之用途、悉照原定標準支配、市中心區之市府·曁各局新厦建築費、并未移用復興公債、至舉辦興業信托社、即所以備戰後災區受災區民借本建築之用、蓋市府直接將現欵出借、諸多不便、故有設立信托社、專以辦理該項事業云、</p>

<p>遠東社云、華東民衆救國軍總指揮張志超之參謀長李裕光、專函致其駐滬代表張振東、報告該部在吉東克復阿城烏珠兩縣經過、遠東社記者昨晤張代表、承見告各情如次、</p>
<p>擴充軍費　查敝部原有軍隊八萬餘人、器械完整者逹七萬、溯自九月初旬、與敵在通河呼蘭一帶鏖戰、我軍傷亡前後逹二萬餘人、卒將通呼兩城克復、茲役以後、敵人不敢輕禍、於是我軍得以休養補充、擴張軍實、器械雖不及敵之精良、但尙稱完備、</p>
<p>三路進攻　我軍自克復通呼、擴充軍費後、當分三路進攻松花江沿岸、北路爲王德全司令、（即九月一日克復通河·呼蘭·者、）沿松花江北岸、中路爲張總指揮志超、沿松花江南岸、東路爲王振芳司令、沿中東路一帶、九月五日、三路同時開始總攻、</p>
<p>克復阿城　東路王振芳司令、親率健兒二萬五千人、由海林出發、襲取阿城、摶戰至爲劇烈、我軍衝鋒凡二十餘次、敵億死守不退、王司令遂分兩路包圍該城、一面招募敢死隊五百名、設梯扒城、前仆後繼、敵心胆俱裂、始棄城而逃、復被我軍圍城之軍、迎頭截擊、斃敵千餘人、獲步槍千餘枝、子彈十餘萬發、機槍四挺、該城遂於七日晨完全爲我軍克復、</p>
<p>再克烏珠　克復阿城後、我軍乘勝襲取烏珠、日夜兼程挺進、於九日逹到烏珠郊外、敵聞阿城失陷、敵早胆寒、前遣部隊方與我軍交鋒、後防即逃退一空、於是烏珠於九月十一日夜、不戰而得、</p>
<p>準備攻哈　烏珠克復後、旋奉張總指揮令、以士卒疲勞、應暫時停止前進、且俟中北兩路會師進逹烏珠後、再行襲取哈爾濱、查烏哈兩地、相距僅一百四十餘里、敵知我得烏珠後、勢必取哈、故特派重兵駐守、而我亦知敵重兵集哈、非有充分力量、不可造次輕進、徒損實力、故現滯留烏珠、待機進取、</p>
<p>漢奸告密　詎知有事出人意料之外者、我軍正在整飭訓練進圖取哈、同時本人奉命南來請援之時、忽被漢奸將我軍攻哈計劃、及本人來滬消息、密告哈爾濱敵特務機關、日人並將本人小照放大、張貼通衢、謂能將本人拿獲者、賞金票二千元、本人許身國家、生命早置度外、此來原期向滬上各界報告、俾得援助、即行遄返防次、現時旣不我予、亦惟有不顧一切、盡我輩軍人衛國天職、奮鬥到底、成敗利鈍、非所計也云云、</p>

<p>市總工會昨日招待新聞界</p>
<p>報告怠工經過及勞方要求</p>
<p>中央社云、上海電力公司楊樹浦新廠、前因開除工人三名、及拒付百分之五之養老金、致激成千餘名工人怠工、詳情已誌前報、昨日下午二時、本市總工會特爲此事、在福佑路該會内、招待本市新聞界、報告此次怠工原因、由上海市第四區水電業產業工會常務委員倪文富等、報告經過情形、茲誌其各情如次、</p>
<p>開除工人原因　上海電力公司此次開除工人三人、其開除原因、據云、公司方面聲稱、一因病、一因工作懶惰、一因在機器房睡覺、工人方而、認爲此種理由、實不充足、蓋因病被開除之工人、確經該公司醫生之證明、并由公司准給病假三天、但因病未痊愈、假滿不能親自到</p>
<p>廠續假、故其理由不充足、至因工作懶惰開除之工人、公司當局只稱其工作懶惰、並未宣布其事實若何、而因在機器房睡覺而被開除之工人、工會方會、亦認爲片面之言、蓋電力機器房中、機聲軋軋、危險萬分、誰敢貪睡、且無人目睹其睡覺、機器房工頭亦未有報告、凡此種種、均係資方一面之詞、</p>
<p>勞方現在希望　該三工人已被開除、工會方面、亦有堅持要求復工、惟要求資方依照章程、按名發給百分之五之養老金、此種養老金之規定、由該公司至工部局讓歸於美商時所决定、並曾經公司當局之認可、惟經工會二次推派代表前往請願、迄無結果、照資方宣稱、凡因過被開除之工人、一律不發養老金、并謂凡自願請求退職之工人、亦不發給此項養老金、然則何種工人、始克享受此項養老金、且與原定章程相背、公司當局、對此旣無充分理由、向工人解釋、乃聲稱公司當局有權修改一切章程、但公司之修改此項章程、在此事發生之前、迄未追告工人、此次怠工之目的、卽爲爭得此項原不之權利、</p>
<p>不致影響社會　上海電力公司、全體工人、以電力之供給、與全市市民關係至鉅、故對於資方之一再壓迫、始終忍受、决不忍一時之憤、釀成全體工人罷工、影響全市、故目下怠工者、僅爲新廠常工、老廠及機器間工人、并未加入、蓋機器工人、參加罷工、其影響必及全市、工會當局、對此甚爲注意、决不造成嚴重情形、惟希望資方明瞭此點、并盼輿論界主持公道云</p>

<p>預測星雨　本年立冬之後、適逢流星經過、其與地球軌道交點之期、屆時有無數小流星、發自軒轅座之第十二星、與第九星之間、均向西南流、名謂流星雨、即民國二十二年十一月十六日黎明前數小時、可見此奇景、預測是夜天氣清明、便於觀看、談天學者、可一廣眼界也、</p>
<p>預測日食　民國三十年九月二十一日、即西歷一千九百四十一年、夏歷辛已年、八月壬申朔、爲日食之期、中國全能見之、惟武昌見食最深、在午正時、晝晦星見、上海見食、不盡如鈎、大星俱見、屆時必有奇異景象可見、</p>

<p>農民合作借貸與合作運銷</p>
<p>本年爲試辦明年正式創辦</p>
<p>年來吾國農村經濟、日逐衰落、幾瀕崩潰、兼以外貨侵入、使鄕間手工業貨品、淘汰、殆盡、農民無不在外國經濟勞力壓迫下掙扎、本市銀行界、均謀至農村施行經濟救濟、上海銀行並已於本年間、實際做去、創辦農民合作借貸、及農貨運銷合作、自本年一月一日辦理迄今、頗具佳續、該行定此一年爲試辦期、至明年一月一日起、正式辦理、華東社記者特於昨日向該行當局探詢、茲將所得分誌如下、</p>
<p>農民合作借貸　蘇浙皖湘等省農業區内、因受外貨侵略、經濟凋零、農銷滯阻、上海銀行乃於去年間因該行派員赴各省調查之後、籌備農民合作借貸、專事放欵於正當農民、各農民得欵之後、再用該欵購辦種子農作物下種、而將所收穫之農產品售價、歸還上海銀行、此項借貸方法、已由上海銀行於本年一月一日起辦理、惟以該銀行辦事頗爲謹愼、對於借欵農民、限制頗嚴、故而放欵之區、尙未能普遍、</p>
<p>農民運銷合作　除此之外、該行尙有一種農民運銷合作辦法、即如生產過剩之區、或受外貨侵入之農區、當地農民、不能將其生產物脱手者、交由上海銀行在鄕村間設立之運銷合作社、由該社分銷各地或上海、該社則於脱手獲欵之後、稍取用金而已、此項合作社、亦於本年起辦理、</p>
<p>明春正式辦理　此種調劑農村金融之機關、在鄕間確甚需要、本年夏間、該銀行行長陳光甫氏、曾赴各省參觀、印象頗佳、現正式徴求各方報告、並請專家詳細討論指導、關於此種農村借貸運銷問題、本年年底、該行開股東會時、將提出交各股東會議、如果認可者、則於明年起、正式實行、現在尙在試辦期間、故該行不欲對外宣傳、</p>

<p>本市衛生局近於南市蓬萊路舉辦滬南診療所、業已開幕、吳淞之模範區市立醫院、亦在積極計劃中、茲將各情分誌於後、</p>
<p>滬南診療所　市立滬南診療所、已於上月二十一日正式開幕、日來請求診療者、甚爲擁擠、所有診療及醫藥、一律免費、該所以限於經費、故產科及時疫科未能開辦、其他各科均已開辦、如請診者要求拔號、仍須繳納拔號費</p>
<p>吳淞辦事處　吳淞模範區設有辦事處及病院、惟房屋尙在建築中、約一月後可以落成、現在暫假同濟醫科大學設立臨時辦事處、該處房屋成立後、内部設備較爲完備、現已積極籌備、約於年内可以正式開診、</p>
<p>設市立醫院　市立醫院之地址、已勘定於市中心區相近、院址亦已購定、所以未能積極進行者、以經費尙無着落、但適當人才一時難於物色、亦爲主要原因之一、但市立醫院之創設、乃爲已定之計劃、故市衛生局仍在設法、以期早日實現該項計劃云、</p>

<p>自殺與靑年女子　左匀</p>
<p>自殺是人生最消極的辦法，人不到不得已最痛苦的時候，决不自殺。所以自殺在成年人大都是迫於經濟關係，前途决不能容許他再生存了，纔出於這一個最後的下策。自殺在靑年女子就稍有不同，雖然也多半是經濟關係；可是一個女子在靑年的時候，伊的經濟關係最大的不過是生活問題而已。總不會有債務和負擔的逼迫，那末，伊的自殺未免就過分了。</p>
<p>這中間是另有一種心理存在着：国爲靑年人的性情是興奮的積極的，一遇刺激，好像烈火受到冷水的噴射，立刻就熄滅的一様。他們把前程當着一條「蜀道」，以爲無論如何是走不通的。尤其是女子往往不肯在環境中掙扎，情願一死了之。</p>
<p>譬如最近在張華浜投水的女子黎澄，以及王仁女士的失蹝，都是十足的表現靑年女子怕了奮鬥的心理：黎澄的遺書中說：「……努力嗎？頭也昏了，眼也花了！……人生是多麽的痛苦，何等的艱難？惟有將那没有用的軀殼送葬波濤，永决苦惱的人世，解脱一切麻煩了！……」再看王仁的絕命書也是說：「……怎様有勇氣與環境奮鬥呢？惟有悲傷，灰心，頽喪，厭世……我覺得我難得一光明的大道……」黎澄和王仁，雖然一個是投水而死，一個是失蹝；可是伊兩個怕生存的心理是一様的。伊倆只知道生存是痛苦的，而不知道人之生存，本來就需要奮鬥。靑年女子一旦脱離依賴的家庭生活，開始和社會接觸的時候，往往先存着恐懼的心理，所以一接觸社會，就被刺傷了。</p>
<p>有許多無知識的女子也是的，最近有同鄕人王姓家的養媳婦，年十八歲，又張姓家的新媳婦，年十九歲；前者是小康之家，後者生活較難。這兩位女靑年都是吞烟土自殺的，一個是毫無緣由，一個是有姦情嫌疑，但是都不是被迫到自殺的程度的。</p>
<p>可見得在二十歲左右的女子，伊們的感覺特别的敏鋭，在這時理解力和判斷力，反極軟弱，又不能分析環境中的種種事變，所以極容易誤走歧途－－自殺。</p>
<p>中國社會經濟情形一天不如一天，失業人在增多，飢餓者在發狂，這様下去，懦弱的女靑年自殺的比率，必將逐漸的增高。這前途是大可憂慮的，這問題是很嚴重的。</p>
<h3 id="c155">傳道婦　陳亮 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>早上，十點鐘光景。</p>
<p>從靜安寺到十六舖的二路電車三等車廂中，一些衣衫不很整齊的乘客，疏疏落落的用着不同的方式坐着，坐着。安閒地，舒泰地，没有憂愁的感覺。</p>
<p>但，歡樂的感覺也没有，一切是情緒的眞空車在王家沙打停的時候，上來一個中年婦人，留着髮結，白布短褂兒，黑裙，鞋襪也是白色的。一張没塗脂粉的臉，鑲着對怪活絡的眼珠子，嘴巴是比通常的女人大些。</p>
<p>沉寂給她衝破了。</p>
<p>然而，大家心裏已經明白，「伊是一個傳道婦」，伊用敏鋭的目光在車廂裏掃了個遍。再把后裏的一疊小册子分發了。扁扁嘴唇說啦。</p>
<p>「諸位先生，你們總該知道吧？耶穌就是上帝。」</p>
<p>可是，這幾句話，都打大家耳邊輕易地溜過了，大家正在衝着腦袋兒翻那本小册子。</p>
<p>一個不識字的穿着香芸衫褲的漢子，也在那兒把小册子顚倒地翻弄着。想再找出一張像封面上那種五彩美麗的畫片哩。</p>
<p>傳道婦並不呈現着失望的神色，繼續地說。</p>
<p>「只要是人類全是罪惡的，這本小册子上有一段說話－皇帝，百姓，忠臣孝子，大奸巨猾，統是罪囚，只有上帝纔没有罪惡，上帝是拯救犯罪的人的－所以，你們只要敬重上帝，相信上帝，上帝便會賜給你們幸福，便會饒赦你們的罪惡。」</p>
<p>「幸福」，像一枝尖鋭的針，把大家的神經刺了一刺。「罪惡」，又像把亮光光的板斧，在大家面前晃了兩晃。</p>
<p>「嘻！」傳道婦笑啦，大家都笑啦。</p>
<p>但，誰也没明白笑的緣由。</p>
<p>笑聲没了的時候，沉寂依舊來補了空。没有憂愁的感覺。</p>
<p>但歡樂的感覺也没有，一切是情緒的眞空。在心裏戰交着的，只有「罪惡」和「幸福」。</p>
<h3 id="c156">女人散絃 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>女人·伊們寗可與同伴合坐一輛黄包車而在路旁斤斤的爭論着一個銅子·却不　穿不滿二十塊錢的一雙高跟鞋上大公司去購物·這也許是女人的所以稱爲神秘吧！</p>
<p>一顆貴重的鑽石·不及一隻縫針來得切於實用；一個摩登女子往往不及一女工來得於社會有益，因爲摩登女子大都是社會的寄生蟲！</p>
<p>一個摩登女子來了·把高跟鞋踏得咭格咭格地響，趾高氣揚地，似乎街頭的東西都不值伊一盼；高跟鞋呀！在這裏我佩服你魔力的偉大，你不僅抬高了女子的身體·同時也抬高了女子的地位·更抬高了女子的身價·（俊思）</p>
<p>一天，正是大月底：伊紅着臉兒，傴僂着背，懷了摺子，照例到那機關　領取欵子。那碧眼黄髮的外國人，眼爱何等厲害。見了伊這様反常的態度，好像已十分明瞭伊的内容。望着伊高了的肚子，打着半生不熟的中國話。冷笑着說：「你現在已經有了男人了，何必再到此間來領錢呢？」說着，把那摺子一筆勾銷。伊碰了這個釘子，渾身好似灑子一桶冷水。又羞又急，要想和他置辯：「我是害着臌脹病。但終究没有這股勇氣，終於默默的，含着兩行清淚，悄悄地回家。從此度着凄凉的歲月，做了舊禮敎下的罪人。伊的情人，因見伊手頭漸形拮据，也絕跡不到。</p>
<p>伊肚子是大了：但仍舊是個「孤苦無告」的寡婦！</p>
<h3 id="c157">在「人」的生活圈子以外　胡沉舟 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>這兒是在「人」的生活圈子以外的。這兒五六百間茅棚子兩排站着。因爲排着的密度，它們當中央的距離就狹窄啦，狹窄得不能兩個兒並着肩　　。又因爲不規則的排着，它就異様的曲折。在西南跟東北兩方面各在一個口子-出入的口子。空氣是很齷龊的，地方是很齷龊的，路是很齷龊的（四周圍都是動物的排泄物跟植物的垃圾。）那些茅棚子怪矮小的，一個七八歲的孩子可以不要彎着身子踅進去。</p>
<p>這兒住着女人們-賣自家的身子的女人們。伊們是在人」的生活圈子以外的。伊們没有快樂，也没有悲哀。伊們祇有饑餓，祇知道饑餓。就是伊們知道了饑餓，伊們纔天天機械地把自家的臉兒厚厚的塗了粉，把自家的眉兒畫得細細的，把自家的嘴兒搽得紅紅的……不論冬天，不論夏天，伊們天天機械地站在門口，那些茅棚子的舉行展覽會似的，讓每個人參觀，選擇。伊們當中頂老的有四十歲以上的，頂小的有十四五歲的，並且有好多是臉兒有缺點的或肢體有不完全的，譬如；麻臉，獨眼，跛足……但伊們都有一切動物有的感應性，伊們用一種騙人的笑跟醜陋的形態掩飾了伊們的缺點這兒是一切勞苦大衆，特别是黄包車夫的安樂窩。他們是不着重「形式」的，只着重「性」的充分的解决。他們在這兒化了二三毛錢就可以得到暫時的「性」的滿足。但他們的平常生活的剝削，「性」的苦悶，使他們在這個「解放」的機會裏，求報復似的蠻幹。可是伊們依然繼續着在「人」的生活圈子以外的「生活」。因爲，因爲伊們知道饑餓啊！</p>
<p>這兒是在「人」的生活圈子以外的。</p>
<p>主婦須知</p>
<h3 id="c158">幾件值得保存的廢物　珮瑜 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>婦女，尤其是家庭中做主婦和母親的婦女，可以分爲兩類：一類是喜歡把零碎東西，隨時隨地的貯藏起來，一類是隨手把零碎雜物，不顧一切的棄置室外，喜歡把碎東西貯藏的婦女，在人數衆多，用物繁雜的家庭中，最爲相宜；但是伊們應當有整潔的習性，把零碎雜物分門别類的貯藏好，要用的時候去取出，不用的時候仍放好；這様才不致使家庭裏到處發見又像棄掉，又像保存的零碎雜物。</p>
<p>隨時把零碎雜物保存或貯藏的婦女，一定可以得到一種相當的愉快。例如從商店中買了甚麽包紮的東西來了，把包紮的紙和繩，保存起來，一旦家裏要包要結甚麽東西，便可以拿出來用了，不是很便當很順手的嗎？有此自己裁製衣服的婦女，偶然要配一小塊的綢或布。假使伊平日是一個喜歡把零碎東西貯藏起來的人，一定可以在家裏找到，無須臨時要到商店裏去買去配。在用得着的時候，是勝利愉快的時候，但是在伊把零碎東西，分門别類，收藏的時候，却是伊麻煩的時候。平常有麻煩困難的時候，臨時才有勝利愉快的時候，切不可因怕麻煩，嫌困難而中止保存廢物的利計劃。</p>
<p>居室狹小，家務繁多的婦女，恐怕不能隨意把零碎雜物貯藏起來；因爲貯藏零碎雜物很費時間與地位的，而且貯藏得愈多，拿出拿進的時候和揀東揀西的次數愈多。有許多喜歡貯藏零物的婦女的困難，是伊們不知道何者應該保存，何者不妨棄掉，在保藏零碎雜物的本質上，不能有相當的决斷。伊們的廚房和浴室中，陳列或推積了不少藥水瓶，空罐頭等源源不絕而來的東西。在伊們把這些東西保藏起來，也有正確充分的理由；因爲伊們知道有幾種的空瓶和罐頭是有用處的，所以見了空瓶空罐，便一起的收拾保藏了。</p>
<p>依大槪的情形而論，收藏藥水瓶是愚笨的，因爲要用到這種瓶，事前非把它一再洗清不可，否則有危險性的。有螺旋形金屬蓋的各種空瓶，值得保藏的，洗清後可以放在廚房中備作他用。假使喜歡出外旅行或舉行野宴的，這種瓶更有大用處；因爲有了螺旋形的金屬蓋，瓶内所放的東西，雖有震動搖擺，不致滲漏。不論大小，而有螺旋形金屬蓋的磁質粉罐，也值得保藏的。大的白磁罐，容易貼籤條，註明内藏何物，放在廚房中有許許多多的用處；例如香草，調味品，乾荷蘭芹，切成小塊的乾酪，以及其他各種食品，都可以放在這様的罐内，保持新鮮。有螺旋形金屬蓋的玻璃罐頭更好，因爲罐内藏的何物，可以一看便知的。假使有機會得到大玻罐，例如糖菓店中陳列在櫃檯上的，切不可小覷了它，在省工省錢的經濟廚房中，有極大的用處，或置鹽，或置糖，或藏油，或藏酒，隨你所欲，可以帮助主婦不少。</p>
<p>空的洋鐵罐頭，也是不可棄掉的；尤其是大的，更加要保存起來。有許多東西，可以放在罐内。小的如紙間罐頭，可放針線團針窠等縫紉零件；大的洋鐵罐頭，可以用作權宜之計的麵包倉和冰箱等。橡皮的細圈，結物的繩子完好的包紙紙袋，以及其他包紮用用品，也不要棄掉；但是在收藏的時候，要預先想想將來有用否，如其是有用處的，那是值得收藏的。日常看過的報紙，也可收藏，平日用以包蓋物品，到了冬天，可作火爐的引火物。還有一件用處，在衛生很有功效，就是灰箱中多烟舖幾層報紙，便可把垃圾煤灰，包起來丢入垃圾箱，不致塵灰飛揚。</p>

<p>上半時一比一天下平分</p>
<p>下半時全市隊勢如破竹</p>
<p>上海市參加全運之足球隊、薈萃羣英、實力强厚、爲準備在全運中掃蕩港粤來軍、練習合作工夫起見、特約本年上海西人足球隊中之勁旅法商隊、昨日下午作友誼賽於中華棒球塲、結果以五比二獲大勝、法商猛將如雲、全市隊能得如此勝利、足見實力之一斑、萬餘觀衆、滿意而歸、裁判員樂秀榮、</p>
<h3 id="c175">法商來勢不小 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>全市隊向北進攻、法商隊得開球之優先、動役之後卽取攻勢、其來非小、全市以合作之尙未人乎節拍、大受其累、球門之前、遍是敵踪、李寗江善敬、苦守後方、接應不暇、法商前鋒之三角派司、活動非凡、全市雖偶而上進、轉瞬卽返、處處警訊之時、果然疎忽一漏、法商左翼格林勃、得中央來球、一脚進網、爲時僅二十分鐘、</p>
<h3 id="c176">究竟老孫鐵腿 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>法商之攻勢仍猛、尤以柯萊脱鮑休脱得、兩翼之助、活動殊甚、法凡却傳中極好、華特送左、格林勃惜未射準、否則又殆矣、經此一番訓練、全市隊漸漸入港、馮運佑入替李寗、後防較安、江善敬傳徐亞輝而逹李義臣、李正中一脚、福禄壽接得而倒地、未中惜哉、鍾勇森再送中央、亦無成就、然全市之反攻、從此益烈、皆以遠球砲射、其時孫錦順在門前二十五碼處、瞥見來球、反身一鈎、矢的一聲、飛入網角、其妙無窮、嘆爲觀止、一來一往、天下遂成平分、</p>
<h3 id="c177">從此砲火連天 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>全市之勢、頓時一振、李義臣率領全師、時近敵門、屠開元一次送一好球飛落右翼、惜未接應、萬象華截獲來球、見機趕上猛撲、被守門救成角球、徐亞輝亦前進遠射、相差不多、萬象華之角球、李義臣、未曾頂中、法凡却推人受罰、梁樹棠之五十碼之任意球、陳家球跳起一頂而未中、砲火連天、全市之威風漸顯、惜乎正當入手之時、上半時嗚笛休息、</p>
<h3 id="c178">一下連獲三城 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>下半時起、全市隊大加補充孫錦順改領中軍、陳洪光替孫位、而羅海光則補陳家球、義臣家球、後退休息、陳鎭祥換取徐亞輝、前鋒之陣線一新、法商亦小有更動、右前衛之小華特、改充中鋒、全市經此刷新、一時容光煥發、十五分鐘内、連中三元、上塲之二分鐘、陳洪光下馬威風、首中其一、迅雷不及掩耳、全市遂告佔先、羅海光於五分鐘後、再度破城、成三比一、孫錦順得鍾勇森之球、而傳陳洪光、又入鵠的、十五分鐘内、竟如天崩地潰、法商從此一敗不堪收拾、</p>
<h3 id="c179">意外拾得一球 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>法商遭此意外、並不稍變初衷、仍節節反逼、下半時已去其半、格林勃閃身避過屠開元、鮑休脱接得射門、顧尙勷權充守門、尙能應付、球未送出、江善敬正欲盤之而出、未過人、法凡却已自右衝出、急不及防、爲其獲中、法商得挽救一球、而法商獲勝此球後、以急欲恢復、全軍前進、後防空虚、萬象華乘機遠射、福禄壽接得來球入手而溜脱、羅海光隨手拾得、輕輕送去、亦意外之收入、滿場閧然、五比二後之最後十五分鐘、全市之五虎、出入門前、來去如織、福禄壽、顧東防西、狀急而滑　、球之起處、大笑隨之、法商得未再失、眞大幸矣、兩方陣綫如下、</p>

<p>少年界慧星出現</p>
<p>余田光雖敗猶榮</p>
<p>雙打决賽天黑未終</p>
<p>邱江現以二比一勝</p>
<p>草地網球會之公開單打另一組複賽、邱飛海對</p>
<p>余田光前曾比賽一盤、邱以八比六勝、因天晚停止、此後復迭爲天時阻滯、方於昨日在法商總會續賽、結果邱又以一比六、六比○、六比四勝、總計邱以三比一勝余、得决賽權、本月七日將邱與王文正爭本年全滬冠軍云、至余之表演、極受觀衆讚美、其進步之速、殊堪驚人、誠爲我國少年界之慧星出現、前途希望無窮、雙打决賽、邱飛海江道章對梁德光卡爾生、因第二盤上、邱患脚抽筋、停賽半小時、遂未能解决勝負、現有比數邱江以六比三、二比六、六比三勝、第四盤至八比八和局中止、以後何日續賽、尙未定奪、</p>
<h3 id="c181">單打複賽 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>邱飛海得决賽權</p>
<p>余田光雖敗猶榮</p>
<p>余田光智慧足夥　一九三○年上海草地網球乙組單打冠軍余田光、在前昨兩年中、庸庸碌碌、維持其原有狀况、並無特殊之長進、今年季節開始時、仍無如何進境、但觀其最近之表演、已深具造詣、前與邱飛海戰、曾以五比二領前、後被邱以八比六勝、往後兩勝鄭兆佳日前與王文正賽、雖以一比三敗、但表演愈臻佳境、昨再與邱戰、上塲一鼓作起、以六比一勝邱飛海、誠屬可貴、往後之敗、亦已盡其心力、動作細膩純熟、失誤减少、每球之勝負、來往之次數甚多、對角抽球、穏健而有把握、反手正手、均見成功、上網亦有相當功夫、惜部位稍嫌後、宜前進近網一步、總之、余之擊法、已極顯智慧、實爲少年界中最可造就之人、所欠缺者體格耳、力尙不足、致影響持久作戰之弊病、猶望注意平時之體格訓練、來年今日、必成大器、</p>
<p>邱飛海三比一勝　邱之勝余、煞費苦心、奔走不遑、疲於應付、良以余之對角抽球、不易攻破、故當余左右抽擊時、邱東奔西跑、祗有招架之力　、而無反攻之能、然遇有機會、輒又每能制敵無用武之地、第一盤余之以六比一勝邱、確有功夫、左右逢源、得心應手、邱惟有甘拜下風耳、第二盤邱一洗如病弱之態、形勢突然轉變、余於努力　抗之下、竟全失六局、第三盤、又在緊張局勢下爭扎、表演愈臻美妙、觀者掌聲不絕、余先以四比二局勝、邱反以六比四奪回、總計邱以三比一勝、而得决賽權、當比賽終了、邱大讚余之身手、草地網球會會長葛林姆旭與秘書脱維特列、亦爭與余握手、深表佩服嘉奬之意、然則小余雖敗亦榮矣、</p>
<h3 id="c182">雙打决賽 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>邱江二比一佔優</p>
<p>第四盤天晚未終</p>
<p>邱飛海患脚抽筋　邱余單打劇戰後、邱已疲憊不堪、稍事休息、邱與江道章對梁德光卡爾生又作雙打决賽、於是在第一盤上、邱遂有脚抽筋之不幸事件發生、幸按摩經半小時之休息後、仍能繼續作戰、然時間緊縮、比賽乃未能如期終了、三盤結果、錦標未决、第四盤邱江先以四比零之局數勝、以爲不難取是盤而解决錦標、詎知被梁德光卡爾生追上、成四比四此後各以發球局得勝、分庭對抗、由五比五而六比六、直致八比八、一時難解難分、而天色已晚、不得不暫行終止、日後再行繼續、</p>
<p>競爭興趣甚濃厚　四人之技術、均有可觀、卽如衰老之江道章、亦能發揮所長、不遺餘力、惟卡爾生之表演、反覺减色、攔網時觸網甚多、發球尤多失誤、每輪至卡之發球局、輒多失敗、否則、局勢或有轉變、然競爭形勢、始終</p>
<p>緊凑、愈戰愈烈、興趣亦有增無减、是以北風雖大、寒氣逼人、觀者仍駐足不移、興味倍極濃厚、</p>
<p>第四盤難解難分　第一盤小有接觸、梁卡在合作上、時有破綻、邱江以六比三勝、第二盤邱江以二比一佔先、邱忽患脚抽筋、撫摩後、經半小時之休息、繼續比賽、邱因不抻奔跑、梁卡遂以六比二勝、但第三盤又被邱江以六比三勝、梁卡表演頗佳、初不料能敗、實以觸網自殺之球太多故耳、第四盤邱江以四比零勝後、竟未能取得是盤、梁卡振作精神、追成四比四、以下各以發球局得勝、致成相持不下之局面、七比七後、邱失去發球局、以爲梁所發球局後、可以勝矣、詎梁亦失手、乃又成八比八、天黑而終、</p>

<p>— 趙燏黄</p>
<p>新著「現代本草生藥學」緒論之一節</p>
<p>日本文化起源。較各國爲遲。自昔竭誠模仿中國。大有非中國文化不受之槪。醫藥是其一也。自西洋文化入日本後。於是日本又一變其接受中國文化之</p>
<p>態度。以歸化西洋。醫藥上之文化。亦隨之轉移。日本雖無固有之國粹。而富有從善如流之天性。此三島民情之特長也。吾國醫藥有三四千年之歷史，儼然以先進自居之國。而反落於日本之後。此因傳統之觀念過深。窒礎進步所致也。茲以本草而言。日本明治維新以前之本草家。其研究吾國本草之毅力。迥非清代·康·乾·嘉·道·咸·同年間（西紀一七三六－一八七四）之醫藥家所能企及。中國本草。自梁陶弘景修訂之神農本草經。直至明李時珍之本草綱目。中經本草發逹時代之唐宋。關於其間所有之本草珍秘典籍。吾國久已佚亡。求之日本。往往可之得之。此日本注重吾國醫藥文獻之明證也。試縱觀明治維新以前（西紀一六○七－一八六七）之本草家著錄。復返觀吾國同一時代之醫藥書籍。大有相形見絀之槪。墰本草綱目。傳至日本。約在西紀一六○七年　吾國明萬曆三五年。即日本　長一二年。由林道春得自長峙。（與中國接近之地）獻於幕府。至一六七二年（康熙一一年寛文一二年）即有貝原益軒所箸之校正本草綱目三十九卷出世。一七○九年（康熙四八年寳永六年）復成大和本草十六卷。一八○三年（嘉慶八年享和三年）小野蘭山。成本草綱目啓蒙四十八卷。此乃極有價值之著作也。至今日本講和漢本草之學者。必根據是書而詳證之。其他本草書類之可以備考者。如稻生若水之庶物類纂一千卷。成於一七○四年（康熙四三年寛永元年）蔚爲文獻上之大觀。島田充房之花彙八卷。成於一七六五年。（乾隆三○年明和二年）曾槃之成形圖說一百卷。成於一八○四年。（嘉慶九年寛永元年）此皆有功於藝文者也。至西紀一八二八年。當吾國道光八年。即日本文政十一年有本草學大家。岩崎常正者。積二十餘年刻苦之功。著成本草圖譜九十卷。蒐　草木凡二千餘種。圖繪精審。色彩兼施。爲日本本草書中之傑出。迥非吾國一百餘年前本草學家所能夢見。蓋吾國本草圖書。拙陋失眞。可笑孰甚。往往貽譏於日本之學者也。吾國本草圖之較爲正確者。雖前有明之救荒本草。後有清之植物名實圖考。（道光年間即西紀一八二一－一八五○年間版）爲庸中之校佼。然以本草圖譜比較之。則亦何能望其項背。又飯沼慾齋所著之草木圖說三十卷（一八三二年即道光一二年天保三年至一八五六年即咸豐六年安政三年間版）圖說詳備。名實可稽。且能用科學方法。描寫實物之生態矣。本草圖譜。經後世白井光太郎之考訂。草木圖說。經近代牧野富太郎之增補。燦然大備。乃近世研究和漢藥惟一之參考書也。</p>
<p>（附誌）一九○○年間。（大正十一年）日本將本草圖譜原稿。重刊發行。經震災之後。板本已燬。偶有保存者。極爲學者所珍視，輸入中國之本。恐僅僅可指數而已。以余所知者。商務書館藏事部。已燬於滬役。北平恊和醫學院藏一部。前上海中央衛生試騐所藏一部。及著者藏一部而已。</p>
<p>至論日本本草學的科學化。約在西紀一七八二年。當吾國乾隆四七年。即日本大明二年。和蘭醫學初輸入日本。即蘭學階梯出版之後一年。（一七八三年）有瑞典之醫師。名統拜喜（C·P·　Thunqerg　1743-1828）者。乃醫師而兼植物學者也。傳林娜氏之學於日本。一時從學者。如桂川甫周輩。均出其門。氏之著述。有日本植物譜（FloraJaponica　１７８４年版）遺餉本國學者。一七五○－一八六六之間。德國醫師而兼植物學研究家。名西伯爾特（Siebold）者。亦至日本。研究植物。如本草學家。水谷助六。伊藤圭介。均親實其學。助六則譯林娜氏植物種篇。（即Houttuyn所著之“Natuurlyke　histotio…van　Linnaeus”Deel　IL　Planta　14　Stuk　177-83）而應用之。决定植物之學名。於是本草之學。將根據植物學而漸入堂奥。當一八二九年（道光九年文政一二年）伊藤圭介。亦依據西伯爾特之學。著泰西本草名疏二卷。由是植物學從本草學而脱胎。本草學並從植物學而奠基矣。至一八三三年當吾國道光一三年。即日本天保四年。復有宇田川榕庵。著成植學啓源三卷。並將武因滿）Weiumann　Phyhytebthozaiconagraphia（即J　Burmann　Taalryk　Register　der　Plaatafte　fignurn-oschryvingen　derblcemdragende　gewassen　1736-1748）從和蘭文譯成。此即一八二九年新訂增補之和蘭藥鏡十八卷也。於是日本之本草學與植物學。溶化而爲一爐。結查則成植物學化的本草學。而本草學之進步。駸駸乎有直追歐美之勢也。</p>
<p>嗣是以降。即明治維新以來。（即一八六八年以後）再由各種自然科學之攙入。煆煉鎔籌而成之本草學。一變而學嶄然　立之生藥學矣。日本現代之生藥學。由植物學家。間接而得　利益者。如三好學。松村任三。白井光太郎。牧野富太郎。業師柴田桂太郎諸敎授是也。由藥科中之生藥學專家。或藥化學專家。直接而得莫大之貢獻者。如先師下山順一郎。長井長義。丹波敬三。平野</p>
<p>一貫。及現代生藥學兼藥化學大家朝比奈太彦等諸敎授是也。最近如刈米逹夫。藤田直市。中尾萬三諸輩。在生藥學上之研究尤多。於國藥上之可以取鏡者益大。吾國藥學幼稚。舉國若夢。眞有望塵不及之嘆。中尾氏並考察吾國歷代本草之淵源。備極詳盡。自山海經。毛詩，爾雅。曆代本草典籍。以及關於本草的經史百家雜箸。無不旁證博引。悉心探討。箸爲記錄。處於現代生藥學的立塲上。大有將起吾國數千年以前舊本草復活之槪，日人推爲中國本草學大家。並無愧色。嘻。中尾氏之本草學。豈眞使吾國舊本草復活之目的乎。所以使現代生藥學的研究上。可得許多參證之助云爾。語云。温古知新。可以爲師。其中尾氏之謂矣。</p>

<p>— 丁福保</p>
<p>肺結核舊名肺癆病，因患者甚多，故簡稱曰肺病。其病原爲結核菌。此菌侵入肺臟後，其性質特别頑强，無論何種内服藥注射藥，皆不能撲滅之。惟恃吾人天然之防禦力，由白血球將結核菌圍困，而於其外又生結締質爲之堤防，築成極堅固之防禦線，使此菌不能奪圍而出，併絕其糧道，其後該菌尙能生存至二年有半，方歸死滅，故以結核菌生活力之頑强，非吾人有此天</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>然之持久防禦力，實不足以　其死命也。但世人不知利用此防禦力，爲根本之治法，謀長期之抵抗，乃欲　恃藥物以撲滅其病菌，故患者往往先服中藥不效，改服西藥又不效，續服報紙上宣傳之各種特效藥，又不效，或服猴棗對口菌紫河車等種種單方，暮四朝三，百藥亂投，或東馳西騖，勞頓於舟車，或問卜求籤，謀之於神鬼，如是者久之皆不效，患者因終日勞動，不肯靜臥，將圍困病菌天然自成之防線摧毁無餘，其菌早已蔓延四周，擴大其占領地，病勢於是日趨嚴重，而病人及病家，則如處五里霧中而迷其方向，如黑夜航海而失其羅盤，又如盲人瞎馬，夜臨深池，有一落千丈之虞，不僅彷徨四顧無所適從而已也。</p>
<p>國人對於肺病之療養，皆在模糊影響之中，尙未瞭解其所以然，故傳染日廣而無所底止。考日本衰和田博士最近之調查，謂日本每年有發熱咯血疲倦咳嗽等結核症狀者，二百萬人，每年之死於結核者，十三萬人。夫吾國人口約多日本七倍，若以日本爲比例，則每年有結核症狀者一千四百萬人，死於結核者九十一萬人。吾國之醫藥衛生狀况，不及日本遠甚，此無可諱言者，故吾國若有統計表可核，則其數必不止此。然即以此數言之，其每年之醫藥費及减少收入之工作費，若每人每日以四角計之，其爲數之鉅，已足驚人，况家中有一肺病患者，當然不能不需看護之人，故除患者之外，至少尙有一健康人失去其活動能力，故自一家之財政而言，實有不堪其痛苦者。</p>
<p>犧牲於肺病者，尤以靑年爲多，此蓋二十歲左右之人，對於結核抵抗力較弱之所致也。吾人自十二三歲時，大抵爲結核菌侵入，潛伏於體内之各處，其在肺臟者，吾人即於患部築天然之堤防而圍繞之，往往堤防尙未堅固，或因讀書作事之過度，暗中之斵喪，種種不衛生與劇烈之運動等，自將其堤防破壤，即漸現結核諸症狀　發病。而其中尤以運動劇烈爲害最速，試觀東西各國，每次開運動會，運動家爲劇烈之競技後續發肺病者甚多，即其證也。吾國近年提倡運動，可謂極盛，然學生中若有潛伏結核而其堤防未固者，設一旦爲競技之運動而破破時，則急性肺病即驟然爆發，故此種學生，僅可爲小小運動，運動後即宜休息，若爲長時間之劇烈運動，即不啻自摧其生命。昔上海顧拯來君，無錫薛劍霞君，素以運動體育著名，爲學生之領袖，皆忽患急性肺結核死。若夫無名之英雄，爲劇烈運動而引起其肺病者，正不知其幾許也嗟乎，一國之靑年，爲一國之重要分子，今爲結核摧殘如此，人材之凋耗，療養之靡費，其損失遠過於每年之内戰，自國家而言，破壞一國之經濟，傷殘國民之元氣，實極重要之一問題也。近世結核病理，幸已漸次阐明，同時由許多之實地經騐，知結核不但易防，而且易治。其所以不爲治者，因病人不知體内有自衛之能力，而反重視無足重輕之醫藥，或坐失其最重要之初期療養之良機，或病勢進行而愈迷其處置，有以誤之也，在結核初期，本極易治，患者每將此期蹉跎荏苒而過之，及至覺悟，能注意及眞正之養生法，而病已入膏肓，吁，可悲矣。</p>
<p>著者從事結核之治療有年，對此觀念尤深。故發心將其一得，貢之世人，擬以治療結核之根本方針及其豫防法，使一般民衆澈底瞭解，俾彷徨四顧無所適從之患者，如得一識途之老馬以爲響導，又如得一明燈以燭昏塗，不致迂回曲折於羊腸烏道而誤爲康莊，試航於斷港絕流之中而　至於海，此即是書之所以名爲指南也。設政府諸公，將此書加入國民敎育，使成爲國民全體之常識，則全國上下，皆對於肺病有確實之理解，並知肺病之不足畏，可以藉自然之療養而治愈，不但閲者及其家人萬一發此病時，可以從容應付而有餘裕，即對於豫防，亦有所遵循而可期其完全。或曰，是書也，出版者不可以版權自私自利，宜公諸社會，聽人翻印。售書者，僅可取回成本，以便閲者。或慈善家集資印送，以廣流傳，亦可於善書中别開生面。或又曰，此</p>
<p>書果流行於全國，必能減少一國之結核病人及其看護人，並減少經濟上之巨大損失及民衆之無謂消耗，此即所以培國家之元氣，及此而圖，猶可爲也。余曰，唯唯，少時頗思盡力於社會，以效一得之愚，乃日月逝於上，體貌衰於下，六十之年，忽焉已至，仍終日蜷伏於書叢中，與蠧魚同生死，尙思以閒著一書，推行於全國，似非個人之力之所能也。個人之所能者，僅放棄其版權而已矣。如有熱心社會人士，將此書删之改之，以匡其不逮而廣佈之，此固鄙人所昕夕禱求者也。</p>

<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>焦先生說：一回顧國醫學界：担無系統和不合科學的罪名，旣不許開學校，又不許辦醫院研究機會，不如西醫遠甚，但他們的治療成績，還超過西醫之上。此爲早年胡適之病患腎藏炎，經西醫之精密的檢查，開會研究，認爲已屬無可救藥，致由國醫陸仲安治之而愈。……某德醫之夫人患盲腸炎，施行割治，割後痛不可忍，德醫自無辦法，改由國醫陸仲安治之而愈。……王愷仁兄妹都業西醫，他們的母親患咳嗆，自己治不好，改由立法院委員劉積學治之而愈。……本京中南醫院職員廖嘵勛患浸淫瘡，發　發疼，自口鼻以下，周身黑點羅布，本院西醫無法療治，改由陳遜齋治之而愈。……胡適之，錢玄同，陸仲安，劉積學，陳遜齋，皆係知名之士，不難質訽。我們以爲無論那一種醫學，祗求治病有效，都該提倡，却是現在的西醫，偏不肯承認自己有短處，偏不肯承認國醫有長處，由於前一種心理，他們會說有幾種機質病，終於治不好的，由於後一種心理，他們會說有幾種症候，不治也會好的，我請問前面所舉的幾種疾病，是屬於前一種呢？是屬於後一種呢？……」焦先生舉了許多例，證明西醫没辦法的病，國醫都能醫好。但是内中某德醫夫人的痛，德醫没有辦法的話，我可以說一句必無其事；因爲科學醫的止痛藥，比較國藥效力來得大，奏功來得確實，外科的進步，完全靠着止痛藥，中國的古書，說華佗剖腹刳腸，也靠着麻沸湯，我曉得手術後的痛，是一定有辦法的。這事，或者是某德醫的父，母，岳父，岳母，或是夫人自己，不狠信任科學醫，不狠信任自家人，服了幾服藥，不見奏效，一定要請敎舊醫，某德醫拗他不過就是了，並不是無辦法。至於吃了陸仲安的藥，竟會治愈，這是時期已熟，適逢其會，或者服了中國藥，陵神上得了安慰，也可以促進治愈轉機。所以銷但例，恐怕靠不住，除了此例之外，其餘也許是實事。諸例中的人物，吾多没有碰面過，只有胡君適之，曾由陳方之介紹，作了一席長談。他的腎藏炎經過，我可以大略明白，照我看來，是胡君的自然治愈。我有許多理由寫在下而，和焦先生同時和國人商榷一下。</p>
<p>我有一個同學何君志　，現在浙江醫校當外科敎授，他在幾年前，害了慢性腎炎，西醫都診斷他腎藏結核，非常危險，喫外國藥不見好，喫中國藥-是被動的-也不見得好，後來休養了一年半載，身體的輕微熱度退去了，尿中蛋白質或者膿也没有了，現在人狠健康。啹子琴先生的外孫，葉楚傖夫人的妹子的兒子，去年，害了慢性腎炎，我也疑他是腎結核，我把將養看護的法兒敎他们以外，别用土貝克林軟膏塗擦，過了幾個月，也居然好了。可見慢性腎炎，也有不用手術而汉愈的事。</p>
<p>再把德國柏林大學敎授卡司湃爾Leopoldcasper氏的泌尿器科學裏面論腎藏結核一段文字引來，做學理上的探討，他說道：「講起腎藏結核的療法來，却有兩派的說，互相對峙，就是姑息療法，和根本療法。前者，主張用内科的藥劑和土貝克林注射，可以治愈，林哈爾茲Lenhartz氏，披立開pielicke氏，卡羅Karo氏，乃此派的代表。後者，主張凡腎藏結核病人，苟在手術可能範圍内，必定務須把該患腎除去。……自從結核成了一個國民病的意義阐明以後，結果，在近來時代，本病的研究，顯明地興盛起來了，其眞摯研究的成績，是訓誨我們知道；結核是可以治愈的事，實在超過於從來人們所懸揣的程度以上。試看那肺結核療法的效果，一天一天良好起來，是人們所知悉的。骨，關節，　和腹膜結核療法，也有良好結果，這事我們也有所認識。可見得結核這個病，都有輕瘥或治愈的可能，廼末腎藏結核，照様保存起來，當然也可以治愈，這事情是可以推想而知的了。但是，實地上的經騐，究竟與這個期望，是否不相違背的呢？對於這個疑問，實在狠對不起，只好答應一句「未能承認」。林氏所舉的一例，記載不甚詳密，頗難窺得其眞相。（未完）</p>

<p>第三節　新舊醫藥定期刊物</p>
<p>在十年以前。新醫界華文刊物很少。尤其報章上。是不討論醫學的。舊醫更無刊物。最近數年來。因新醫的努力。和新舊學說的紛爭。於是定期刊物。風起雲湧。盛極一時據我個人所知。全國有近四十種之多。而各藥廠藥行之廣告式雜誌。猶不在内。舊醫也有十餘種。可是有幾種。中途大都停刊了。如今我且把這些刊物。分類列表。今紹給讀者。並加以討論。</p>

<p>（廿一）同仁醫學　　　　　　　醫學雜誌　　　　日本同仁會</p>
<p>照上表來論。上海出版的新醫藥刊物。有二十一種之多。要佔全國總數的一半以上。比較學校。尤其側重。在正面看來。好像是新醫發逹的朕兆。但是仔細想去。也有許多值得我們討論的地方。第一上海新醫界執筆的人數是多少。有没有分出廿一種雜誌的必要。第二我們細看表中的分類。計民衆讀物有五種。醫藥評論醫事行政討論二種。專門學說討論二種。餘下十二種都是普通醫藥雜誌。雖則文字内容程度都有些上落。要之是醫藥界的讀物。試問全國新醫界人數。有没有這些讀者消納此上海出版的十幾種刊物的可能。從這二點上想來。明明知道這些刊物也有些畸形的發逹。而上列幾項流弊已爲不可掩飾的事實。（一）執筆者一稿數投。各刊物中發見的著者。老是筆健的幾位先生。精華不能集中。（二）各刊銷數大旺者甚少。散漫而不經濟。（三）有名著者。受各刊物之徴文。須分投各稿於各刊物。以致疲於奔命。（四）各刊物限期出版。因感稿荒而不免有聊以塞責的文字。（五）一刊物之編者。於各刊物讀不勝讀。而採用執筆者許多雷同文字。甲報已曾見過。乙報又復刊布。（六）各藥房商號。受各刊的招攬廣告。也覺莫衷一是。不知登了那一家好。因恐廣告的效能减少。遂有藥商自辦刊物之舉。（七）上述雖則將各刊物酌量分類。而實際上評論中也有學術專著。雜誌中林也狂論醫政諸篇。體裁混雜。不合讀者胃口-凡此種種。是我們新醫界應行逐步想法的。如今我們再拿其他各埠的刊物。列成一表。來與上海刊物作比較。</p>

<h3 id="c195">喝茶 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 豐之餘</p>
<p>某公司又在廉價了，去買了二兩好茶葉，每兩洋二角。開首泡了一壼，怕牠冷得快，用棉襖包起來，却不料鄭重其事的來喝的時候，味道竟和我一向喝着粗茶差不多，顔色也很重濁。</p>
<p>我知道這是自己錯誤了，喝好茶，是要用蓋碗的，於是用蓋碗。果然，泡了之後，色清而味甘，微香而小苦，確是好茶。但這須在靜坐無爲的時候，當我正寫着「喫敎」的中塗，拉來一喝，那好味道竟不知不覺的滑過去，又像喝着粗茶一様了。</p>
<p>有好茶喝，會喝好茶，是一種「清福」。不過要享這「清福」，首先就須有工夫，其次是練習出來的特别的感覺。由這一極瑣屑的經騐，我想，假使是一個使用筋力的工人，在喉乾欲裂的時候，那麽，即使給他龍井芽茶，珠蘭窨片，恐怕他喝起來也未必覺得和熱水有什麽大區别罷。所謂「秋思」，其實也是這様的，騷人墨客，會覺得什麽「悲哉秋之爲氣也」，風雨陰晴，都給他一種刺戟，一方面也就是一種「清福」，但在老農，却只知道每的的此際，就要割稻而已。</p>
<p>於是有人以爲這種細膩鋭敏的感覺，當然不屬於粗人，這是上等人的牌號。然而我恐怕也正是這牌號就要倒閉的先聲。我們有痛覺，一方面是使我們受苦的，而一方面也使我們能夠自衛，假如没有，則即使被人在背上刺了一尖刀，也將茫無知覺，直到血盡倒地，自己還不明白爲什麽倒地。但這痛覺如果細膩鋭敏起來呢，則不但衣服上有一根小刺就覺得，連衣服上接縫，線結，布毛都要覺得，倘不穿「無縫天衣」，他便要終日如芒刺在身，活不下去了。但假裝鋭敏的，自然不在此例。</p>
<p>感覺的細膩和鋭敏，較之麻木，那當然算是進步的，然而以有助於生命的進化爲限，如果不相干，甚而至於有礙，那就是進化的病態，不久就要收梢。我們將享清福，抱秋心的雅人，和破衣粗食的粗人一比較，就明白究竟是誰活得下去。喝過茶，望着秋天，我於是想；不識好茶，没有秋思，倒也罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c196">躊躇 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 程雲萍</p>
<p>妻儘在愁眉苦臉地坐着，默默地一聲不響。</p>
<p>每天三個人只能合吃一升米，半挨着餓，到現在已是兩個多月了。妻埋怨，生氣，這也難怪。我伸直了腰，搓着兩手，低聲下氣地說：「還是這様罷：决計把咱們的牛賣去，好給王老板找他媽的四五塊錢，其餘的，只好又去求讓了！咳，没有錢簡直不是人！」</p>
<p>妻抬起她那枯槁的面孔-那是一個如何悽慘的面孔呀！那高聳的顴骨…那深陷的眼眶…那瘦瘦的嘴唇……她說：</p>
<p>「賣去了牛，明年就活活餓死不成。王老板，虧他做得出那麽一副面孔，往年咱們那一次不是十足的交給他的租？天理良心，滿口就一百個不問賬！打死和尙不能剃了辮，我們自己都没有吃啦，不找他，看怎様我們！」</p>
<p>妻近來變得容易生氣了。已改變了從前萬事總是好好商量的脾氣。每看見她這模様，我就只覺得是自己的不對。我很抱歉的說：</p>
<p>「明年-明年再來想法罷。老天爺該不致又像今年様鬧大水。咱們三個人合吃一升米，總不能度日的呀！賣了牛，也好買點米。隆兒，棉衣也得做！」</p>
<p>「你賣你的，我不管！」妻的頭掉過去了，我聽見吸着鼻水的聲音。她在哭了不賣牛，又有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>但是，我心裏又躊躇起來了：賣？賣給誰？可以支　多少時候？以後呢？-以後也不能不打算打算，因爲，那是不久就會來的呵！</p>
<h3 id="c197">靑島咖啡　--靑島印象之二 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>感謝朋友的盛情，他讓我也做了一回靑島咖啡座上的貴客。</p>
<p>從滙泉沿馬路過去，在相隔不遠的清靜的海邊，傍着疏疏的槐樹林子，有一所小小的洋房。每天，夕陽踏着微波退隠以後，那兒就吸引進一批豔裝華服的男女。</p>
<p>進去吧！白衣的侍者含笑相迎，跑過一道甬道，就來到廳上。四壁輝煌的壁　，電燈是白熱的。跳舞廳在正中。再跑出去，瀕海的露台，大理石的圓桌，精巧的座位，驕倣的微笑，塗着蔻丹的指甲的　手，高脚杯裏臙脂般紅的葡萄汁……</p>
<p>露台的石欄外是一片夜的海。</p>
<p>天上正掛着一輪將圓的月亮。</p>
<p>那兒，浪花無休止地飛躍着，跳上沙灘。嘩啦-嘩啦-每一疊浪打到岸上，就　一道銀白的花邊。一聲神秘的音響。那兒，月光平平地舖在海面，漁船的帆影在遠處移轉，而另一邊閃爍着千萬盞鬧市的燈火。</p>
<p>呷了一口冷咖啡，心裏在想着什麽－－</p>
<p>前一天自己獨自在匯泉飯店吃了一杯冰淇淋，淡淡的，而且粗劣。可是價目是半元。這兒的咖啡多少一杯？</p>
<p>半元。貴嗎？不！到那兒去的大老闆一定不會吝惜這戔戔之數的。</p>
<p>跳舞廳裡奏起了流行的爵士音樂。</p>
<p>白衣的侍者恭敬地來往。刀和义在音樂裏旋律地動着，女人的媚笑，紳士的彬彬有禮的姿態。低低的私語。</p>
<p>朋友跟我談起閒天來了。</p>
<p>他說，這靑島咖啡是白俄商人開的，每年這兒祗做一個夏季的生意，（過了夏天他有别的營業）可是能賺很多的錢。他說，匯泉飯店是日本人開的－－靑島的經濟勢力全在日本人手裏，許多工廠也全是他們經營的。有的打起招牌說是中國資本，背地裏股東還是日本人……於是我想起海濱公園相近的「接收紀念亭」來。祗要名義上已經「接收」，這當然是豐功偉蹟，值得「紀念」的了。况且我們這靑島没給德國的時候，原祗是長着一片野草的荒島啊，現在却已給他們修築得花團錦簇般的了。</p>
<p>正想着，燈光暗了。</p>
<p>綠紗燈下，一對對摟着的男女，跟着音樂的節奏婆娑起舞。</p>
<p>我望着月亮，望着舖滿月光的海，望着跳上沙灘的白浪，望着那幽靈般移動的人影－－</p>
<p>樂吧，朋友。着夜還没有回去，喝盡你杯中的甘酒罷！</p>
<h3 id="c198">袁中郎做官（續） <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>這様的說陳，也依然是没結果；於是，中郎祇得再寫第七牘，改變策略，乾脆的說，「語有之，君行令，臣行意，今台臺令固在必行矣，職之意寗可繫絆枷杻之耶。除將印篆内外封識赴府交投外，職掉臂行矣！」經過這様的九牛二虎之力，中郎總算把縣令辭掉，回復他的自由人生活。這時他的快活，却又如初得官時相似了。他寫給聶化南道：</p>
<p>敗卻鐵網，打破銅枷，走出刀山劍樹，跳入清凉佛土，快活不可言，不可言！投冠數日，愈覺無官之妙　　弟已安排頭戴靑笠，手捉牛尾，　　　　　　　外人矣！</p>
<p>中郎的官夢，到此乃完全醒了。他覺得過去官生活太苦，乃大遊歷以賠償他自己的損失，漫遊各處，約一年多。這時的他的感想，那是「吏道日遠，坵壑日近，弟之心近狂矣！痴矣！「（與趙）無錫）袁中郎也曾做官，做官的經過大體如此；想到他那時在官的狼狽，眞眞令人發噱，不知當今的許多官官先生，看了作何感想？</p>
<p>×　×　×</p>
<p>做官，在一般官迷的眼中，是一件高不可攀的樂事，而中郎，却偏偏要說是苦交易，其愚傻眞有些不可及。但是，中郎究竟爲什麽這様的不願做官呢？這倒也有它的原因，不能不予以交代。這裏，進一步的，表白中郎爲什麽不願做官。</p>
<p>在中郎走馬上任不久，他就感到有點「難乎爲官，」他寫信向毛太初訴苦說，「弟已得吳令，令甚煩苦，殊不如田舍翁飲酒下棋之樂也，一最初的味口，是就有些不對了。他覺得很煩苦，這意思，在給沈博士的信裏又重複的說及：</p>
<p>作吳令無復人理，幾不知有昏朝寒署矣！何也？錢榖多如牛毛，人情茫如風影，過客積如蚊蟲，官長尊如閻老這和給龔惟學的信裏所述的，「過客如蝟，士官若麟，是非如影，」頗有相似之處。但究竟還不及在另一封給沈廣乘的信裏，說得更完備，更澈底，他把做官的苦惱以及必須具有的醜態，是和盤的托了出來。他說：</p>
<p>上官如雲，過客如雨，簿書如山，錢榖如海，朝夕趨陳檢點，尙恐不及，苦哉！苦哉！然上官直消一副賤皮骨，過客直消一副笑嘴臉，簿書直消一副强精神，錢榖直消一副很心腸，苦則苦矣，而不難。唯有一段没證見的是非，無形影的風波，靑岑可浪，碧海可塵，往往令人趨避不及，逃避無地，難矣！難矣！</p>
<p>中郎在這封信裏，表白的很是憤慨，他的意思，是做官煩苦不算，還要做卑躬屈膝的醜態，做醜態不夠，還有閒是非。這様，便把堂堂的中郎弄得太苦，而不得不求去了。很可惜，大約中郎依舊不失爲忠厚長者吧，他不肯多寫一些做官的醜態，完成一部「官臉譜，」而只是把重心放在煩苦方面。做官的煩苦，他自己陳述的很多，在已涉及的而外，他寫給陳志寰的信裏，就又說過：</p>
<p>在此繁苦不堪道。大略鷄鳴而起，三更而息。每困頓時，輒思世間有長夜齅睡者，不知定是何福修得。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c199">神女 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>－獻給好友ＴＫ－</p>
<p>有許多事，總是縈廻在我的記憶裏，而且時常强迫着我把它寫出來，在這種不能忘却的事件中，也許是含着某種值得記載的眞理的吧。</p>
<p>其實那只是一件極平凡的遭遇！</p>
<p>兩年前，我到廣州某學校去敎書，學校没有寄宿的地方，而我又因爲帶着不多的路費，只得暫時寄宿在一家比較經濟的小旅店裏。</p>
<p>房間是在頂樓上，豆腐方塊那麽大，汚濁的墻壁，汚濁的地，汚濁的床，汚濁的桌椅，只隔着一層木板，一間間地並列着，正像是牢獄，而且没有朋友，也不懂得那地方的話語，-成了這麽一個孤獨的人。</p>
<p>時季雖然已經過了中秋，而南國的氣候，還是那様地鬰熱。雨，好像總是聚集在天空的海裏，不斷地落着，這窒息的氣候，使人感到非常地不舒適。</p>
<p>特别不快的是在夜裡。熄滅了燈，眼望着黑暗的空間，不能睡，這時從那只隔着一層薄板的隣屋裏，便傳來了男女的淫穢的聲音。最初我好像是非常地厭惡，其次又好像是在靜靜地聽着，最後將自己緊緊地裹在被裏。……</p>
<p>對於一個到處漂零的人，這境遇是特殊地難堪的，在孤寂的心境上。更加了一層生理上的壓迫，那兇湧起來的性慾的怒潮，終於衝破了道德的堤防，心靈上一切防範的戒備完全被擊得粉碎了。</p>
<p>「呌一個姑娘吧！呌一個姑娘吧」！那講着一口天曉得的普通話的廣東茶房每天夜裏是必定這様來問的。雖然有許多次已經受了我的冷面孔，但他並不因此就灰心。對於年靑旅客的猶疑懦弱的心境，他該是怎様的一個老手吧。他像是一個惡魔的巨掌，無論如何，也把你捉捕了來。</p>
<p>這一天，我已經失掉了一切的抑制力，反常地對他笑了笑。這笑洩露了我内心的必密，使他向我更逼近了一步，像是說什麽秘密的話似地，作着可惡的姿勢，講了許多我不能夠充分理解的言語。「先呌一個來看看吧！今天有一個特别美麗的姑娘！」他說着就急忙轉身走去了。大槪他很能夠理解，這被捉來的俘虜，也許馬上就又要變卦的。</p>
<p>事實上，這環境已經不能容許我再多猶疑，那個露着惡魔的勝利的微笑的茶房把一個年靑的女子留在我的房裏，便急忙轉身走開了。這時我的心情反倒平靜起來，我有趣地望着那個女子的容貌，望着她的身材；她裝出含羞的様子對我媚笑着。這個女子的面像，我還記得，我將永久記得的罷。略有幾分姿色，而是異常地瘦瘠，除去營養不良和憔悴的現象之外，再也看不出仠麽特色了。</p>
<p>她微笑着向我身邊凑來，於是從她帶來的那異香的氣味之中，更傳出一種女人特殊的肉味，這氣味便我立刻對她發生了一種反感，但我仍然保持微笑的面孔我對她搖搖手，告訴她坐到桌子對面的一張椅子上，不要逼近我的身邊來。</p>

<h3 id="c200">與國聯技術合作的檢討 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 胡天</p>
<p>財長宋子氏，本年於參與華府會商及世界經濟大會的餘暇，在美成立了五千萬美金的棉麥借欵，在日内瓦　得中國與國聯技術合作决議來的通過。這消息傳播以來，引起中外各方面深刻的注意。日本對於此舉，認爲是一以夷制夷」的抗日政策，一再肆其恫嚇手段，企圖破壞，近來且派杉村繞道東北來華，作暗中監督之計。在國内，輿論界對於此事亦已屢加詳述，大致於原則的贊成之外，以印度的殷鑑不遠，切望政府勿與人以操縱的機會，馴致積重難近而終遭亡國的慘禍。</p>
<p>我們以爲問題的重要性，在國聯的技術合作到底能否復興中國經濟？此次技術合作開始時，中國應有的準備如何？現在請先述與國聯技術合作交涉經過的槪略，以明合作的性質與範圍。</p>
<p>（一）與國聯技術合作交涉的經過</p>
<p>中國與國聯的技術合作，並不始於今日。國民政府定都南京後，添設衛生部，專司全國醫政防疫保健諸事宜。一九二九年一月，薛篤弼以衛生部長的名義，致函國聯衛生股長拉西曼（卽現任國聯駐中國合作聯絡員），請其來華襄助中國衛生事宜。三月，國聯經行政院的决議，接受薛部長的聘書，這是中國與國聯技術合作的開始。其後，一九三一年五月國聯又通過國府所提關於技術合作的建議案，於是中國與國聯的技術合作遂具體化了。計當時由國聯派遣來華的專門技術人員，共有四組：（一）敎育專家組，任務爲考察中國現行敎育制度，提出改良意見，並研究中國敎育上的需要。（二）工程專家組；任務爲考察河道疏濬，土地開拓及道路建築等問題。（三）經濟專家組；任務爲考察土地，農業，計劃工業的發展及襄助水災救濟事宜。（四）行政專家組；任務爲研究中國行政法規，以備國府諮詢。</p>
<p>三年來，雖則中間因暴日侵華，對於合作的進行，發生了不少的阻碍，但據說因爲仍然獲得了很大的效率，所以此次宋氏在歐，對於國聯與中國的技術合作遂有進一步的計議。國聯行政院於七月三日開會，討論此事，决議指派一小組委員會，考慮中國的請求；予中國以技術合作，並委派專門技術家爲聯絡員，俾能令各專家於恊助中國時，可以合作。七月十八日，國聯所指派的小組委員會在巴黎舉行首次會議，由國聯行政院主席墨西哥代表任主席，計有八國代表出席：</p>
<p>中國－宋子文·顧維鈞　意大利－波恩休里</p>
<p>英國－哈衛　　　　挪　威－史棠</p>
<p>法國－馬西格里　　捷　克－阿索斯基</p>
<p>德國－凱東　　　　西班牙－阿里文</p>
<p>此外，美國應該委員會的邀請，亦派代表麥里内，以觀察者的資格列席。委員會决議委派拉西曼博士爲國聯駐華技術合作的聯絡員，並通過一决議案，申述國聯與中國的合作，純爲技術性質，絕無政治關係，並規定聯絡員的任期爲一年，其任務（一）向中國傳逹國聯各種技術機關的消息，以供參考；（二）報告中國方面關於各種技術合作的請求於國聯；（三）襄助中國選任專家；（四）調查國聯所派專員的工作，並報告國聯。</p>
<p>此次合作事業的内容，還未十分清楚，大槪爲（一）建設重工業（包含電氣開礦等事業的設計）；（二）治理水利；（三）鐵道合作（四）衛生新設施；（五）改良農業等。比較上届的合作，最可注意的是建設生工業的合作。現據聞全國經濟委員擴大組織之後，將於該委員會中設立一關於與國聯技術合作的小組委員會，專司其事。聯絡員拉西曼已在途中，行將到華，此後的發展，當視拉氏與國府商的結果如何了。</p>
<p>（二）國聯合作與經濟復興</p>
<p>國聯與中國合作的性質及範圍，槪如上述，那麽，中國是否需要此項合作呢？原則上，誰都不會加以否定的答覆罷。日内瓦日報主筆馬丁，此次到華游歷，於回歐首途之前，爲時事月報特撰一文，題目是「中國與國聯技術合作之意義」中有一段提及中國的需要此項合作，說「在經濟的領域與國民生活上言之，今日中國百端待舉，實有充實國家設備，並使之適應於自選的技術文明之必要。惟此項努力，中國顯然不能獨立完成，因旣無充分的財力，亦無敷用之技術人員，更無行動上所必需之諸　憑籍也。」這位遠道來客的說話，我們是同意的。中國的建設，那一方面不需要財力？那一方面不需要技術人員？别的不說，單就此次上述五項合作事業來看：（一）重工業方面，鐵部所籌備的中央鋼鐵廠，至今未成。（二）水利方面，以前的水災勿必說，全年黄河的水災，據呈報中央者被災區域已有四省五十三縣，人民生命財產的損失，雖尙無統計，　爲極慘烈的　牲可知，（三）鐵道方面，最主要的幹線如粤漢路，庚欵方面雖已借到若干，但仍然未見開始於未完成段的修築；其他更無從談起。（四）衛生方面，通都大市，近來雖已稍有設施，而稍較偏僻的地方，人民死於疫，死於庸醫，不知有多少，那有誰顧及呢？（五）農業方面，農村破產，農民哀怨呼號，那更不必說了。總之，僅僅就此數端，已可見財力與技術人員的急切需要了。况且中國的國民經濟，已是整個的崩潰，設或不從速作緊急的救濟與根本的治理，中國民族唯有死路一條。在這意義上，中國確乎需要與國聯的技術合作。這是一條救治中國的路，但是一條險路。爲什麽呢？因爲中國的經濟情勢，與别國不同。</p>
<p>藉外資與外國技術人員來興國的前有美國，近有蘇聯，但中國不能引以爲例的。如其引美國與蘇聯爲例，倒不如引印度的亡國爲例，因爲中國的情勢，比東印度公司時代的印度更爲危險呵。中國要想以國聯技術合作來復興經濟，第一就須排斥外來的經濟勢力：凡是租界所在，外商工廠的烟囱無不冒着濃烟，以雄厚的資本及先進的技術與設備，利用華工低廉的工資，又得逃避税捐之利，其所製造的出品，中國廠商還能和他競爭嗎？最重要的紡織業於是一敗塗地了。關税不能完全自主，外貨傾銷的洪水淹没了一切正在萌芽的產業，早經中央决議的傾銷税法，至今仍然不能見諸實施，事實不是日本從中阻撓嗎？這様倒是舉不完的，我們覺得外來的勢力不排除，產業無從保護，更談不到復興，國聯合作，卽有成績，亦徒然讓帝國主義者多吸中國可憐民衆的幾口血，第二，又要說到財力與技術人員問題：中國無財力，需要外資，没有錯；中國缺乏技術人員，需要外國的技術人員，也没有錯。但是財力靠人，技術也靠人，在此帝國主義者正爲市塲的爭奪互相火併的時候，中國政府又是薄弱無能到這地步，能保得住他們不會喧賓奪主嗎？况且帝國主義者的勢力本早已深入中國，根深蒂固，欲排除而不可得，現在能保得住他們不作更進一層的深入嗎？帝國主義者的誠意，恐怕比仙藥更難得，中國的如意算盤，恐怕没有這様容易，事實當然還在後面，但是如果因了國聯與中國的技術合作及友邦的外資得能挽救中國經濟的危機，那正是「苦命注定了」的中國人應千感萬謝的。</p>
<p>（三）我們應有的準備</p>
<p>國聯與中國的技術合作，原則可通，事實是很難的，含着多量的危險成分，但是「事旣定矣，」如其徒作消極的批評與杞憂，還不如來談談應有的準備罷。不過我們希望以後關於這類關於國計民生的大事，最好不要預先决定，事後來一個「追認，」就算爲法定手續完全符合，使在解放政權以後，國民也得有供獻一得之愚的機會。</p>
<p>關於技術合作，中國自己的準備，第一應考查以前國聯所派專家的成績如何，譬如前次工程專家波利葉及古德等所草擬的導淮，華北水利及上海築港等報告書，農業專家特拉貢尼及白利對於改良土地及農業的報告書，何者可以採用，何者可資參考，何者窒碍難行，都應加以一番整理工夫，否則舊的計劃書還是擱在那裏，原封不動，新的專家到華，照例又是一番考察，研究，做報告，不是重床疊架，便是計劃書的堆積，於事實仍然無補，我們爲什麽要化錢借用外國技術人員呢？第二，中國誠然缺乏技術人員與財力，但是要像中國的浪費才與財，世界上恐怕再没有第二個國家了。國内大學畢業之外，以國庫，省費所培植，或私費出洋的留學生，每年一批一批的出去，每年又一批一批的得了博士，碩士，學士的學位回來，但他們的出路就只做官與敎書。至於數十年來外債與内債又不知用在什麽地方的。近年財政雖然困難，但坐領乾修的掛名美缺，仍有不少存在，爲什麽不裁充文化費的呢？總之，適才不能置於　所，這是目下的病象。現在國聯合作旣將開始，對於人才，自己雖感散亂而缺乏，但應設法集中，並使所學得其所用，客鄕建議，不過徒供參考，主體在我，總不致權爲人操。外資以外，國内冗　可裁者猶多，費目編列可商者亦不少，應設法挹注於建設事業。第三，中國經濟的復興運動，確是很難的工作，應大處落墨，小處着手，如其多擬幾種不切實際的五年十年計劃，倒不如逐步推進，作小範圍的進行。第四，總動員的準備；工作的程序應從小處入手，但中國經濟的危險旣在整個國民經濟的崩潰，工作的展開，還須普及各地與各方面，所以總動員的準備是必要的。總之，國聯技術合作，現旣决定進行，若專靠别人資金是外國的，人才是外國的，而自己毫無準備，這是危險萬争的事。</p>
<h3 id="c201">中國工業的現狀與前途 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 李宗藩</p>
<p>在表面上，近二十年中國的工業，不能說學有相當的進展。這裏祗把上海的工業狀態，分</p>
<p>爲一九一二年以前與最近的兩個時期拏來比較，便可瞭然。</p>
<p>（一）在一九一二年以前，上海的工場不過一○一所，但至一九三○年大　小工塲，總計共逹一，七八一所。在短短的十九年中，以上海爲中心底工業資本主義勢力，竟擴展到十餘倍。</p>
<p>（三）一九一二年前，上海的製絲工場祗有二○家，一九三○年增加到一○七家，至於紡織工業，一九一二年祗有紗廠三二家，紗錠八三五，三五四枝，織機四，○三八架；到一九三二年已急激地增加，紗廠有一二八家，紗錠四，五一六，八九八枝，綫錠三八七，八九○枝，織機共四二，五九六架。</p>
<p>這種生產規模驚異的發展，卽可以說明中國資本主義發展的例證。</p>
<p>而且從生產的集中狀態來看，現在的生產資本額與生產力及生產額的比較，比二十年前增加了婁數十倍，則與工場數的增加十數倍或數十倍，竟逹到幾百倍呢！</p>
<p>中國工業資本主義的長足進步與發逹，更於中國對外輸出貿易統計上，露骨地表現了，茲列舉其統計數字比較如左：</p>
<p>○　　　○　　　○</p>
<p>機器輸入的激增（單位海關兩）</p>
<p>一九一三年　　四，六五○，○○一</p>
<p>一九二三年　　二六，六七七，七九六</p>
<p>一九三二年　　六六，八四四，○四六</p>
<p>原料輸入的激增：</p>
<p>（一）棉花輸入數（單位担）</p>
<p>一九二三年　　　一三四，七三五</p>
<p>一九二一年　　　一，六八二，五二六</p>
<p>一九三二年　　　四，六五二，七二六</p>
<p>（二）小麥輸入數（單位海關兩）</p>
<p>一九二○年　　　三○五，二七九</p>
<p>一九三一年　　　八七，六三九，○○○</p>
<p>一九三二年　　　五一，八三一，○○○</p>
<p>（三）火柴製造材料的輸入（單位關兩）</p>
<p>一九二一年　　　二，二八○，○○○</p>
<p>一九二七年　　　二，二五八，○○○</p>
<p>一九三二年　　　一，三一七，七六三</p>
<p>（四）化學工業原料的輸入（單位海關兩）</p>
<p>一八三七年　　　六八二，二三六</p>
<p>一九二七年　　　二四，八○○，○○○</p>
<p>機造洋貨輸出激增：</p>
<p>一九二三年　一九二七年　一九三一年</p>
<p>粗布　　三、六二九　　一二、六九九　　一二、二二九、○○○</p>
<p>棉紗　　四、三四五　　一九、七六九　　三四、二二四、○○○</p>
<p>洋灰　　　　一七七　　　　　四七六　　一、○○四、二○三</p>
<p>地毯　　四、六九一　　六、五二五　　　四、五四八、九○九</p>
<p>染料　　　　　一○　　一、七三○　　　　　四、三四</p>
<p>註：洋灰係一九三○年的輸出額</p>
<p>中國機器輸入的激增，表示中國使用機器之新式工業的逐漸發逹，工業原料－其中棉花，小麥的輸入增加，表示紡織工業與麵粉工業的發展，化學工業原料，火柴製千材料的輸入激增，也具有一切化學工業興隆的意義；至於機製洋貨海外輸出的激增，乃說明中國或種工業的一大突進。</p>
<p>○　　　○　　　○</p>
<p>這様中國工業資本主義，隨中國革命過程的進展而勃興，更受世界大戰的影響，其後因中國關税改正，有日本對華工業投資，由於此種刺激，華商企業家起而模仿，因此中國工業資本主義漸次在都市完成相當的發展，同時農村也已孕育了資本主義的胚胎。因此在上述中國工業資本主義發逹過程中，中國固有手工業的崩壞乃是不可避免的事實（中國手工業的崩壞，乃中國工業資本主義急激發逹的結果，而帝國主義商品的侵入，也有重大的關係）。</p>
<p>舊式絲織業，土布業不必說，卽磁業，草帽業，磨坊業，舊式製紙業，夏布業等也都日漸凋落衰退了，而手工業崩壞的根本原因在（一）由於自身所負歷史任務的逐日解消。（二）由特殊優越的自然條件製成的特產物，已產生了别種代替物。（三）捐税負担的加重，成爲新式機械工業製造品的敵害。換句話說，中國手工業欲和機械工業競爭實不可能，於此也可發現中國工業資本主義發逹的一例證。</p>
<p>但是前述中國工業資本主義的長足進步與發逹，僅是槪括的事實，若詳細分析其階段時，則須考察帝國主義在華經濟勢力的顯著作用。試觀帝國主義在華投資額及其種類：</p>
<p>帝國主義在華鐵道投資</p>
<p>英　一二三，○○○，○○○</p>
<p>法　　七、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>日　五九、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>美　一九、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>德　四八、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>荷　一三、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>中國中外銀行資本額比較（單位元）</p>
<p>法定資本　　　實際資本</p>
<p>外國銀行　五九一○、○○○、○○○　六八二、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>中外合辦　一五○、○○○、○○○　一○四、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>華商銀行　三七五、○○○、○○○　一三八、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>帝國主義在華之電報電話投資額</p>
<p>國别經營數　　投資額</p>
<p>英　三　　一二一○、五四八、○○○元</p>
<p>德　二　　四七○、○○○</p>
<p>日　四　　四五○、○九二、○○○</p>
<p>鑛業中外投資額（單位元）</p>
<p>資本額　　　每年產額</p>
<p>中國　五○、○○○、○○○　七、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>英　　二三、○○○、○○○　七、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>日　　七七、五○○、○○○　四、五○○、○○○</p>
<p>帝國主義在華之重工業</p>
<p>造船工塲　　二二</p>
<p>蒸汽機關工場　二二</p>
<p>鋼鐵及鋼銅細工　九</p>
<p>中國紡織工業中外投資額</p>
<p>日　　二○○、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>英　　　二○、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>中國　一三○、○○○、○○○</p>
<p>由以上的統計數字看來，鐵道十之八九，是以外國資本建築的，現時其大部分仍在人掌握中；銀行資本外人經營的占四分之三，華商經營的過四分之一；鑛業外國資本占三分之二，重工業大半在外人掌握中，輕工業主位的紡織工業也一様，外國資本占三分之二；其他航業方面外國資本也占多數，每年輸出入三十億左右的商品，大多數由外國資本經營的商船所運輸。</p>
<p>中國工業資本主義以大都市爲中心，姑不問發逹至如何程度，事實所示，其中民族工業所占地位異常微弱，所以像輕工業中之紡織工業，多爲在華日商紗廠所壓迫，華商紗廠旣沈淪於困頓疲憊的狀態，又正遭遇着行將總破產的運命咧。並且中國工業資本主義的最大缺陷，在缺少基本工業的發逹，特别在重工業，鑛業部門，比先進資本主義國一定要幼稚得多了。蓋中國重工業的不發逹，由於帝國主義列强，對殖民地及半殖民地工業投資的目的，僅在剩餘價值的榨取，絲毫没注意殖民地半殖民國民經濟利益的消長，重視剩餘價值榨取率最多的輕工業，絕少注意到重工業。如此帝國主義在華投資的擴張，不惟不能助長中國工業資本主義的發逹，反促成手工業的崩壞，更阻碍新興民族工業的發逹，這種顯着的事實，極值得人們的注意。</p>
<p>帝國主義輸出商品所起的作用，爲阻止中國新興民族工對成長的基本原素。這正如馬克氏所謂：「帝國主義的商品，像猛烈的大砲，破壞了中國的城壁」，這是周知的事實，無庸詳細解剖：但是中國還有半殖民地狀態中，關税未能完全自由，其必然的結果，使民族工業不能享受關税障壁增高的保護，且因爲這幾年來的世界恐慌，帝國主義列强乃拚命爭奪國際市塲，作爲打開恐慌的第一步，而於世界唯一大市塲的中國，爭戰尤烈；因此中國幼稚的民族工業製造品，國内銷路旣已狹小，新開拓的國外銷路亦被奪去。在此種情形之下，中國民族工業的運命，不得不受帝國主義輸出商品及在華投資的二重侵害。</p>
<p>這様說來，中國工業資本主義的發展一民</p>
<p>在華的經濟勢力，否則决不可能，這是可斷言的。此乃中國工業促進的基本條件。而使中國資本主義走上正當的發逹軌道，那是次要的基本條件。且中國資本主義尙無產業資本與銀行資本的結合，其實產業資本與銀行資本，從其本質與自然條件看來，都無結合的可能咧。</p>
<p>總之，一國資本主義的發逹，須繼資本集中與蓄積的階段，然後才能實現銀行資本與產業資本的結合，民族工業的促進祗有遵循資本主義正規的發展過程才可能，如何使現時畸形發展的中國銀行資本，使作產業資本的動員，這是極有研究的必要底呢。</p>
<h3 id="c202">中國手工業的將來 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 逹五</p>
<p>人類的歷史，經幾番的轉變，由原始共同體，而逹現今資本主義的最高階段。現今的社會，所謂「高速度時代」，横在吾人眼前的：是空中的飛船，地面的汽車，氷下的潛艇，以及資本家大量的商品生產；一切的一切，均以煤氣，電氣和機器爲中心。有人焉，（如TAayler先生等）於此而欲提倡手工業，重整中世時代的生產形態，不能不說是「大開倒車」吧？</p>
<p>手工業之在近代國家，除了以修繕或美術爲主的各種事業之外，根本無發展或存在的餘地。然而今日的中國，纔向產業革命的路上，踽踽地步行着；一部分的通都大邑，雖已逐漸地機器工業化；而大部分的農村，猶停滯於半封建的小生產形態之上。而且農村因受外來勢力的摧殘，内在矛盾衝擊，加速度地崩　着；所謂「土賊赤匪」，乘機崛起，弄得閭閣不安，國本動搖，不得不講求「安定之策」。於是一農村復興一的呼聲，響徹雲霄，種種治標治本的方案，層見疊出；如「恢復三倉」，「開辦保甲」，「耕牛比賽」，「特約農田」，以及「典當業的改良」等等；而「奬勵手工業」，亦是其中之一。看吧，上海不是正開着「土布展覽會」嗎！</p>
<p>手工業與農村經濟，究有怎様的關係呢？生產三要素，誰都知道是勞動，勞動手段，和勞動業像，其中尤以人類的勞動，最爲重要。所以要增加生產功能，先要指進「勞動效率」；要增進「勞動效率」尤先要改善「勞動組織」和「勞動制度」。農業勞動，和工業勞動不同，因受天候的牽制，分配難得其平，古人所謂「春播·夏耘·秋收·冬藏·」，到了冬末春初，田事已畢，農夫大多「袖手賦閒」；而夏秋之交，則因農作繁忙，往往須「夜以繼日」。所以，從整個的農村着想，夏秋常鬧「勞力不足」，春冬常鬧「勞力過剩」。勞動工資，因「供求律」的關係，頻有漲跌，以致農業勞動者的生活，極不安定。無地的　農或貧農，靠販賣勞力，以維生計，到了農閒之時，工資跌落，甚或無工可作時，祇好流向他村，變作「流浪勞動者」（Ｈｏ</p>
<p>fgahger）；或集中都市，構成「產業預備軍」。因此：農村的勞動者，常有缺乏的趨勢，不僅量的減少，而且質的退化，所謂「農民離村」（Landflucht），成爲資本主義社會的農業經營，和農業經濟上的重大問題。於是，一部的人士，主張奬進農村的手工業，以便農民於農忙時從事耕耘，農閒時致力工藝。這様，不但農業勞動的供需，得以調劑；而且於農家經濟，亦大有裨補，實一舉而兩得云。</p>
<p>然而「農民離材」，主因究在那裡？奬進手工業，是否就能消解農村的矛盾？祇要先看手工業本身，是否有存在餘地，便可知道了。手工業是主以「器具」（Tool）爲加工手段的；「器具」與「器機」（Machine）不同，其全部或主要的部分，須以人之體力來運用或操作。所以手工業的特質：在於（一）不能分工（Subkiviaion　ofWork），一製品的全加工行程，以同一人完成之爲原則。（二）加工技術，往往非經精細的訓練不爲功；而技術的訓練，又以長年月的學徒修業爲通例。（三）製品的生產，是加工者用自己久已熟練的特有器具與技能而行之，所以常帶個人的特徴。</p>
<p>但近代工業，是以機器爲加工手段的。（一）機器大抵由然動力而行自動的動作，所以加工力强大，能營人力之不可及的工作；而且使人類的體力勞動，得以大减。（二）機器的加工精確，能使製品「劃一化」，而成「大量生產」。（三）機器可减少手工的熟練，使昔日「學徒制度」，漸趨消滅。（四）機器的動作，迅速而繼續不斷，所以能增没生產量，减低生產費。（五）機器能助人力去征服自然，使原料的採集和供給，豐富而容易（參照黄通　工業政策綱要第三章第一節及第二節）。這様：以「器具」來比機器，一恍如坦克車」之於「大刀隊」，手工業欲以這様簡陋的武器，出奇制勝，吾人眞不禁爲之心驚膽寒啊。</p>
<p>如上所述：手工業之在近代國家，除了一部分以修繕式美術爲中心的特殊業務之外，根本是無存在或發展餘地的。手工業旣不能維持其本身的存在，當然，對於農村矛盾的消解，是無能爲力的。中國的農村，决不能借手工業的援助，以求挽「狂瀾於旣倒」，須要自闢一新途徑方可。然而社會上熱心人士，目下正忙着「土布運動」，想要以「手織品」抵抗「機織品」，其勇氣雖足多，其如時代之不我許何！所以本文的結語是：吾人提倡國貨，無須留戀於中世的手工業，要建設近代的民族工業；不必開倒車，要大踏步向產業革命的路上走去。（二十二年九月二十日）</p>

<h3 id="c208">上海的環境　火 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>歷史告訴我們，八十年前的上海，祗不過是一個荒落的漁村，而今呢，不但成了中國的獨一的大都會，而且成了東亞的一個大都會，而且成了全世界有數的一個大都會。淺薄的說一句，我們這輩不爭氣的國人是應頂禮三鞠躬，竭誠感謝外人的恩光。因爲上海雖是鮮鮮明明的一塊中國土地，却又實實在在的是外人手腕下翻造成的繁華，</p>
<p>八十年來的上海繁華是在極度的畸形，矛盾，罪惡中演進，其所形成的環境，是無時無地，不使人躓踣落陷。人，究竟是隨環境而轉移的，所謂個人的力量，拔萃的矜持，其作用至多只能保持其己身，大部份是必然的跳不過這惡劣的環境的高墻，而必被其呑噬。分析起來，上海是有這麽幾種惡劣的環境；　　第一使你没有民族性，我們的同胞，在生活的掙扎之下，到處觸霉頭，没有出路，於是就有外人出其唾味餘潤，以作釣食，使得大部份的同胞，都搖尾乞憐不得，我們看，洋行的職位，是何等珍寳的優差，一得到手，只要你馴服的像一頭獅子狗，洋大人是會一步一步的提升你的，年功加薪，年尾分紅，使得蜷伏其下討生活的同胞，個個都洗刷得乾乾凈凈，除了黑髮黄皮，尙無藥治，是無上的遺憾以外，一切的一切都洋化了，一切的一切只知爲他人作嫁衣裳、至此民族性也完全湮滅了，心廿情願做一個次殖民地的大國民。</p>
<p>第二使你祗有金錢觀念，本來上海的繁華是完全建築於金錢之上，耳聞目染，只見有金錢的活躍，除此以外，别無可說，追逐得到金錢，就是大亨好漢，否則就是蠢才傻瓜。事實上也只有有錢的人才能立足。於是搶案就層出不窮，各種各様的投機買賣，詐索勒搶，也就無時不有。結果也就是身敗家落，幾多人弄得不可收拾。</p>
<p>第三因只有金錢的狂暴追求，接着就有種不顧廉恥的行爲，處世接物，大家都只顧目的，不擇手段，如目的能夠逹到，手段任憑是怎様的卑汚，也總有掩飾之可能。所謂廉恥，生息地上海的人，眞不知人類是需要這麽一種與實際生活渺無關係的德性。你找得着麽，上海的人有幾個有廉恥觀念？所表現出來的行爲又有幾個是合乎廉恥的？</p>
<p>第四是惡習慣的傳染，這有許多的事實可作證明，嫖賭之成爲公開，紅丸鴉片之販賣，花會之流行，無處不使人墜落，父母倡導於上，孩子們更一步一步的學起來，一代一代的傳遞下去，衖堂口盛行擲銅子，盛行賭博化的抽彩筒，玩輪盤，生長在這様的環境裏，你說要他做個正經的人，簡直是事實不可能。</p>
<p>這種可怕的上海環境，眞不知要到何年何日才能翻身。</p>
<h3 id="c209">社會風景綫　典典 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>二十三號裏本地婦人的女兒可眞美麗啦！生得千嬌百媚，婀娜多姿；彷佛天上安琪兒一般。她是在離家不遠的一所學校裏讀書的，天天早晨挾着書包到學校裏去上課，午後又挾着書包返家。步伐是這様地輕飄，妙條的軀體，更表現得美麗了。街上鱗次櫛比的店舖裏店夥們，見到她走過，都會引着頭向她注目一下；怱忙-或許是閒蕩的路人們也會移動他們的尊目，向她望之又望。她底美麗的丰姿，可想而知了。同弄三十號裏，住着一個年輕少後生，體態昻昻，行動風流，的是個十足的小白臉。聽說是在某洋行裏當寫字的。那天看到這位天上墜下來的安琪兒之後，幾乎把他底魂靈兒飛去，晚上仔細思量之後，計上心來，次日便施出他底全副本領，向這位蜜絲進攻。</p>
<p>過幾天後的一個晚上，忽然見到那個弄堂裏，擠滿了男婦老幼的人們，裏面還夾雜着哭聲駡聲和笑聲。據一個好事的寗波佬告訴記者說：「三十號裏的「魚死」少後生和三十號裏的少女「軋姘頭」，今天給女的娘發覺了，立時雷霆大怒，要拖這個小後生去吃官司咧！」</p>
<p>×　×　×</p>
<p>阿大的娘兩年前還時常笑顔逐開的對着戚友們說：「不要緊咧！我們家裏　　兩年　　　　　　　　　　吵後，無論如何運道不好，至少限度像阿大爺，這様的蹩脚位置，終可以撈得一個的。那時他們兩個人賺錢起來，我們家裏便很可以了，說不定阿大將來還可以找到一比較有點出息的位置，那時我們家裏便大有希望了咧！」說着歡欣不已。</p>
<p>又經過阿大爺娘竭盡兩年心血之結果，阿大終於在他們熱望中的今年畢業了。到現在已經「畢」了有三月之久了咧！起初拿着花綠綠的畢業文憑返家來的時候，似乎誰也有點兒歡欣，情不自禁把畢業文憑拿來讚美欣賞一下，還祝着阿大之前途遠大，彷彿馬上可以做大官發大財了。但這熱度並不長久，過了些時候，許多人看他還是未畢業時候的他，大家便漸漸地對他冷淡了。阿大娘也開始着急苦惱和煩悶起來，不再聽到她以前所說的那些話了。直到如今，阿大竟還是一様，厮守着家中，連他老子這般的蹩脚位置也没法成功。阿大娘除了向戚友們懇情求援之外，鎭天價在家裏怨天尤人着！</p>
<p>×　×　×</p>
<p>小三子又推小車起來了啦！天天早晨推着那輛破舊不堪的小車到街上去，在街畔放着，引着頸等待主顧之到臨，叮是說也奇　，别的車　　電　　　公共汽車咧，都生意興隆，或則忙得不可開交，或則擠得要把乘客推下來，甚至　　　　　　　　　　　　也坐滿了人，飛也似的在街上奔跑着，祇有小三子的小車却一天到晚的空暇着，休說難得有人來僱用，伯「鬼」也有點兒討他厭咧！</p>
<p>看到小三子近來這種情景的隣右們，誰都替他着急非凡。他這幾年已經到牢裏去過三次了啦！三次一様的都是爲着他偷偷摸摸的攝進富庶人家去偷東西，給巡捕捉得之後，抓到行裏去「吃生活」的。第一次關了一日放出來了，那時隣人們都婉勸他，要他「改過自新」，千萬勿再做這般「自甘墜落」的行爲。但隣右們並没給他一個具體的辦法，使他可以「改過自新」。他雖也依然天天推着他家裏所有的那輛破舊小車出去、但結果總是生意毫無。挨不了餓，終於又走入了第一次一般的命運，又聞了兩月出來了。當然啦！那次又是一般的，不久又到牢裏去作第三次之游。那次關了半年之多。而且行裏嚴重警告他。如果他再犯第四次的話，或許要永遠把他逐出租界咧！出來到如今，雖祇有二個多星期，他所走的路還是和以前幾次所走的　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　來，怕　　會走上那條途徑上去的吧！</p>

<p>太陽光進了臥室的窗門，沙才懶懶地睜開眼來。打了個呵欠，痿靡地坐了起來。</p>
<p>「阿陸！洗臉水！」</p>
<p>校役端進一盆面水，輕輕地放在桌子上。</p>
<p>「幾點鐘了？」沙問。</p>
<p>「才上第二課呢」！阿陸說：「先生不上課」</p>
<p>「討厭的，第一課是歷史，第二課是黨義，誰高興上！你給我呌一盆炒麵來！」</p>
<p>臉洗了，穿好了衣服。麵也來了。吃完了麵，出了寢室。</p>
<p>「喂，小汪！」沙輕輕地向坐在敎室裏聽講的同學說：「出來，我跟你說！」</p>
<p>「什麽事？」小汪出來問。</p>
<p>「第三課國文，請代我到一聲。」　　「你做什麽去？」</p>
<p>「没什麽，我要休息一下。」</p>
<p>「噢，知道了！第四課呢？」</p>
<p>「那不能不上，鬍子老先眞不好惹的。」</p>
<p>他到寢室中，關上了門。把堆在桌子夾七夾八的書籍，火柴，香烟頭等推了一推，挪出一塊地方。拿出一本信箋，用心地寫着給愛人的情書。</p>
<p>没寫完，第三課已經退班了！沙似乎有些氣悶，時光過得太快了！</p>
<p>找到了那本高等代數，拿了一本　紙簿和一支鉛筆，還帶了一本小小的課堂中不准有的小說書。</p>
<p>躱在角裏看小說，先生講的一些都不聽見。書看厭了，又提起鉛筆來畫，替坐在前排的女生們作速寫素描。因此又想起了未完的情書。因此又恨時鐘走得太慢。</p>
<p>突然先生聽他上黑板做代數，站了</p>

<p>半天，做不出來。先生訓戒了一番。</p>
<p>「媽媽的，好就好，不好就請你滾蛋！」沙在肚中寫着：「憑什麽我出了錢還要被你駡？」</p>
<p>下午呌人請了假。化了一個鐘頭打</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fang Ji's Remnants Have Lost Their Ability to Resist <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>They are Collapsing and Retreating to Shaling and Liang Sihai Town</p>
<p>National Troops Advance to the Changling Garden and Jingling Line</p>
<p>Zhou's Troops Open Up and Station at Tangshan, Searching and Advancing</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese Troops in Huairou Withdraw to Miyun</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News, Changping Dispatch: Fang's troops started retreating north of the Ming Tombs yesterday, to Shaling and Liang, more than ten li away. Their situation is wretched and not likely to cause trouble. At nine o'clock this morning, a Japanese plane flew east of Changping for seven or eight li to scout, and dropped a bomb. The extent of the damage is being investigated. The plane then flew to the Ming Tombs area to scout. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Nankou Dispatch: The bulk of Fang Ji's forces at the Ming Tombs, surrounded by heavy troops on three sides, began to retreat yesterday to Sihai Town, in the Tenth District north of Changping. The remnants of the troops remaining in the Ming Tombs and Tailing Garden are less than a thousand. The Zhong Regiment of the Central Army, stationed at Da Xiaohongmen, made contact with the Liu Runchuan Regiment of the Zhu Hongxun Division on the right wing this morning and advanced. The outposts reached the Changling Garden and Jingling. Fang Ji's remnants have lost their ability to resist and are collapsing and retreating in disorder to the northeast. The residents of the villages near the Ming Tombs have been completely ransacked by the retreating soldiers. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tangshan Dispatch: The bulk of Fang's troops have arrived at Duhe Sihai Town, about sixty li away from Soushan. Fang's advance scouts are mostly in the Shangxia Zhuang area, about thirty li away from Tangshan. The residents of Jiuduhe and nearby areas are suffering unbearably from Fang's harassment and are mostly fleeing to Tangshan and Changping. Wan Fulin sent the 129th Division Commander Zhou Fuli, along with Chief of Staff Song Yinqing, to Tangshan yesterday from Pingxifu, east of Changping, to supervise the search for Fang Ji's remnants. Zhou's Kang Regiment began searching forward yesterday and captured more than a hundred of Fang Ji's remnants, who were sent to the military headquarters for disposition. Division Commander Zhou transferred from Tangshan to Gaoliying and Baxianzhuang this morning for inspection. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gaoliying Dispatch: Most of the Japanese troops have withdrawn from Huairou to Miyun. Two hundred Japanese troops are stationed in Huairou city. Because Fang Ji's remnants still occupy a small number of strongholds in the Shangzhuang and Xiazhuang areas, causing constant harassment, more than two hundred Japanese troops drove from Miyun to Huairou yesterday morning in more than ten cars for security, to prevent Fang's remnants from returning. Many civilian houses in Miyun city have been occupied by Japanese troops, and many residents have moved to the surrounding villages. People from Huairou said that Xu Wenquan, the magistrate of Huairou County, was dismissed by Fang and replaced by a Li, but when Fang Ji's army collapsed, the puppet magistrate went with him. The post of county magistrate has been entrusted by the Japanese army to a local person. Xu Wenquan's whereabouts are still unknown. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Magistrate Xu Wenquan of Huairou County was previously dismissed and taken away by Fang. His wife was shot in both arms by Fang's troops and is now recuperating in Huairou City. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Nankou Dispatch: Fang Ji's remnants have split into two groups and fled. Fang Ji personally led one group, passing Erdaoguan yesterday and fleeing to the northwest. Another group of about a thousand people is still occupying the mountains north of Jingping. Brigade Commander Luo has dispatched a small number of infantry to search and suppress them, with the aim of eliminating them in a short period of time. Fang and Ji's troops are nominally three divisions, with three brigades per division, three regiments per brigade, and three battalions per regiment. Each battalion has four companies, but in reality each company has fewer than twenty people, totaling about three thousand people. They have less than two thousand guns. (1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, Brigade Luo of Nankou captured Ma Changshun, a spy from Fang's troops. He said that the troops of Fang in the Thirteen Tombs are the 9496983rd Division, and another 60th Division is in the rear as a reserve force. This afternoon, a Japanese plane scouted the Xiaotangshan area of Changping for half an hour and distributed leaflets, warning Fang Ji to quickly withdraw from the non-combat zone, otherwise, a large number of planes will bomb them. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Wan, captured by Fang's troops, Fang Ji attempted to unite with Tang to try again. If Tang could not cooperate, he would occupy the mountains and become bandits, and so on. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The transportation between Ping and Mi, interrupted for many days after Fang's troops fled south from Huairou, will resume tomorrow after Fang's troops flee back to Chahar. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin returned to the city from Xiyuan yesterday afternoon. According to him, Fang Ji's remnants have crossed Erdaoguan and are fleeing to the mountains in the northwest, apparently returning to Dushikou to seek cooperation with Tang again. A small part of them harassing the Thirteen Tombs is still surrounded and fiercely suppressed and can be resolved soon. Although the two parts of Fang Ji have united, their strength is limited and they cannot withstand a single blow. The National Army is bound by the armistice agreement and cannot pursue them. They have now been divided and strictly defended, so there is no cause for concern. I must go to Jiangxi to see Chiang, and the date of departure can only be determined after the Fang Ji issue comes to an end. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Import Tax on Foreign Rice <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Results of the Review Show That it is Inevitable</p>
<p>The Import Tax on Foreign Wheat Will Be Postponed for Discussion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After reviewing the proposal of the five provinces of Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, and Hubei to levy import taxes on foreign rice and wheat, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and other departments believe that it is necessary to levy an import tax on foreign rice. The import tax on foreign wheat is proposed to be postponed for discussion. The reasons for the review are that the customs import tariff rules were revised in May of this year and are now being sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. They have been submitted for review. It is reported that the review opinion is that for imported foreign rice, a tax of up to two and a half gold units per dan and a minimum of complete exemption is proposed. However, it has not yet been approved by the general assembly. Now, the provinces of Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, and Hubei believe that foreign rice and wheat are simultaneously imported and dumped. They have telegraphed requesting the implementation of import taxes to counteract them. After detailed review, our country's tariff rights have been autonomous. In order to curb the large-scale import of foreign rice and protect domestic agriculture, it is necessary to collect import taxes. It is also decided to adopt standard tariffs so that in the event of domestic famine, foreign rice can still be used for relief. On the one hand, efforts are made to ensure the absolute free flow of domestic rice, and attention is paid to transportation and storage. Then, the rice-deficient provinces will not suffer from food shortages due to the import tax on foreign rice. Guangdong should first send personnel to explain in detail, so as to avoid the inability to implement the tax regulations uniformly throughout the country after they are promulgated, which would give foreign countries an excuse. If the government can raise huge sums of money, it should set up more warehouses in various places, increase reserves in good years, and sell at reduced prices in famine years. It should also transport surplus grain from rice-producing areas to rice-deficient areas for sale, which would be more effective in relieving grain glut and regulating food supply. As for the issue of foreign wheat imports, the situation is more complicated than that of foreign rice. First, there are currently a large number of flour mills in China, and their raw materials all depend on foreign wheat. Second, the people of the provinces in the Yellow River Basin have always relied on wheat as their main food. This time, the Yellow River broke its banks, and the disaster is very serious. It seems necessary to import foreign wheat to relieve the disaster area in the future. Third, international negotiations on wheat agreements are currently underway. The impact on our country should be studied in detail. Because of the above three reasons, it is proposed to postpone the review of the issue of import taxes on foreign wheat. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official in charge of the Executive Yuan said that the President of the Yuan, Wang, has decided to submit the review opinions of the three ministries to the Legislative Yuan for a separate resolution regarding the collection of import taxes on foreign rice. The tax increase on foreign wheat will be discussed in a separate case. (A Special Dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Warning of Impending War in the Far East <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>At the League of Nations General Assembly, Mr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative, expressed his just views, stating that "the situation in the Far East is in extreme darkness, and the past year has been one of the most disappointing since the establishment of the League of Nations. The undeclared war, Japan's destruction of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, China has been unable to single-handedly stop the aggressor's ferocity... However, China is determined to maintain all its rights and will never recognize or acquiesce to illegal faits accomplis. China is confident not only in maintaining its territorial integrity but also in resisting the plot to render the League of Nations Covenant a mere scrap of paper." This discourse not only clarified China's position but also deeply regretted the League of Nations' inability to implement its resolutions and use Article 16 of the Covenant to sanction atrocities. Furthermore, he issued a warning, saying, "A shadow is rising in the international skies of the Far East. The arms race has already begun. Large-scale naval and air force exercises, the concentration of fleets, and the sharp increase in military spending are successively becoming reality... These are all signs of a major war within a few years." This is also a fact confirmed by the general public. Although European countries may be misled by Japanese propaganda, we Chinese, who have personally experienced it, deeply feel the poignancy of his words.</p>
<p>The crisis in the Far East lies in the uncontrollable, insane actions of Japanese militarists. Now, they are using the Fang Ji army mutiny and the disturbances of bandits in Luanzhou as pretexts to secretly operate against us. Their violation of the North China Agreement is obvious to all. Yet, they accuse Yu Xuezhong's army's entry into Luanzhou as an act of contempt for the agreement. How absurd! Furthermore, since signing the agreement, they have delayed withdrawing troops and have even increased their forces. Now, there is news of the First Division from Tokyo and the Fourth Division from Osaka dispatching elite troops to China. It is conceivable that their actions not only violate the agreement but also undermine all international conventions. Yet, the Japanese accuse our League of Nations representative, Gu Weijun, of violating the spirit of the agreement in his speech. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese military clique's ambition to covet North China is boundless. This is the primary cause of the crisis in the Far East.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese military emphasized the year 1936, both the army and navy have clearly stated that increasing armaments is a matter of necessity. Their determination to disregard the Washington Treaty and the London Naval Treaty has become a settled fact. Building fortresses on the Ogasawara Islands and striving to administer the Caroline Islands under trusteeship all demonstrate their intent to encircle the Philippines, cast a covetous eye southward on Australia, and encroach westward on India. Hirota Koki, with his so-called "doctrine diplomacy," wants to use this opportunity to break the isolation Japan has faced since withdrawing from the League of Nations. On the surface, he strongly advocates pro-American sentiments, but in reality, he only wants to break the united front of Britain and the United States on the Far East issue, using his diplomatic skills to reduce Japan's enemies, making it easier to wage war. However, Britain and the United States will never be fooled. The United States, in the process of industrial recovery, is working hard to overcome the economic panic, yet it does not neglect Japan's so-called Second Supplementary Naval Plan and has decided to add thirty-nine warships of various sizes, recently stating that it will never stop, directly attributing it to Japanese belligerence. The deterioration of Britain's economic relations with Japan has long been apparent. Even if the Simla Conference succeeds, it will only slightly delay the time of conflict. Moreover, the ineffectiveness of parliamentary resolutions is predictable. This is another cause of the crisis in the Far East.</p>
<p>As for the situation between Japan and the Soviet Union, since the failure of the Chinese Eastern Railway sale, the Soviet Union has reversed its previous silence and repeatedly issued warnings to Japan. Japan has also admitted its intention to strengthen its military because the Soviet Union is strong, saying, "The Soviet army has a standing force of 1.29 million, 2,200 aircraft, and the Red Army stationed in the coastal provinces and the Far East numbers more than ten divisions, with hundreds of tanks and aircraft. Their bombers can easily fly and bomb major Japanese cities." Therefore, in the eyes of the Japanese, the Soviet Union is the most important enemy. They are rushing to start "Japan-Manchukuo Airways," and the act of flying across the Sea of Japan took off on September 29th of this year. Observing the tense relationship and the active military preparations of both the Soviet Union and Japan, it can be seen that the crisis in the Far East is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>In summary, the world situation is so dangerous that Gu Weijun's loud warning, stating that a shadow is rising in the international skies of the Far East and that it is a sign of a major war within a few years, is by no means alarmist. Shouldn't the people of the world be jointly vigilant?</p>

<p>Sense of Disappointment in Geneva</p>
<p>New Unity on the Part of the Little Entente</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Simon and Undersecretary Eden are scheduled to return to London tomorrow to report to the government on the progress of disarmament talks. German Foreign Minister Neurath has already departed to report on everything. Since the German delegation left, the talks have been suspended. Generally, people in Geneva feel disappointed with the outcome of the talks. The current situation in Geneva can be summarized as follows: Germany insists that it must have all kinds of weapons that the major powers possess, such as fighter planes, small tanks, and anti-aircraft guns, to demonstrate equality in armaments. France resolutely opposes Germany's demand, insisting that Germany's current level of armaments should be managed for four years with sanctions attached before any concessions are made. Britain alone opposes sanctions and advocates concluding a convention to stipulate the extent of future disarmament today. The United States seems to support Germany's demands and also does not want to do anything to stop it. There is also a dark horse emerging and gaining momentum, which is the group organized by the Little Entente countries. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Austria, Hungary, and Greece have all joined, aiming to protect their common interests and resist any resolutions by the major powers that affect their interests.

<p>Instructions to Ariyoshi to Lodge a Protest</p>
<p>Demanding the Suppression of Anti-Japanese Attitudes</p>
<p>Hirota's Diplomatic Policy Gradually Taking Shape</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the League of Nations Council on the 29th, Chinese representative Gu Weijun raised the Sino-Japanese issue again. Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, based on the following views, issued instructions on the 30th, ordering Minister Ariyoshi to protest to the Nanjing government. The content is divided into the following four points: (1) The current Sino-Japanese relations, since the establishment of the ceasefire agreement, have been extremely friendly. Especially the Chinese government verbally champions pro-Japanese sentiments, but internally seems to maintain the opposite attitude, which the Japanese government finds regrettable. (2) Gu Weijun's attitude is causing the current friendly Sino-Japanese relations to deteriorate. If this is condoned by the Nanjing government, the Japanese government will take decisive measures. (3) The Japanese government is working hard to promote friendship, but the Nanjing government has the aforementioned attitude. Therefore, the Japanese government will have to reconsider the ongoing cotton purchase issue and other issues related to the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. (4) For the sake of promoting Sino-Japanese friendly relations and peace in the Far East, the Nanjing government should seriously suppress such anti-Japanese attitudes at this time.

<h3 id="e25">So-Called Hirota Diplomacy Still Dependent on the Military's Approval <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota recently wanted to break the diplomacy of the extraordinary situation and develop his lifelong aspirations. He inquired with the Army and Navy Ministers, as well as Deputy Chief of Staff Ueda and Deputy Chief of the Naval General Staff Takahashi, about the intentions of the military. On the 30th, he visited Finance Minister Takahashi to exchange various opinions on financial issues, striving to establish a new diplomatic policy. Generally, opinions have been agreed upon. He plans to present the plan to the Emperor after obtaining an agreement and intends to visit Duke Saionji in mid-month to seek his understanding. Then, he will announce his diplomatic principles and implement them in order. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Foreign Minister Hirota took office, he has met with Army Minister Araki, Navy Minister Osumi, and Finance Minister Takahashi. After explaining the diplomatic policy, the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Finance seem to have reached a consensus on the overall situation, namely: (1) In the extraordinary diplomacy due to the Manchurian Incident, the liaison between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military is necessary. After withdrawing from the League of Nations, diplomacy with the United States and Russia should be carried out in accordance with this policy, and it will be even more necessary before the 1935 disarmament conference. (2) Regarding the policies of various countries to prevent Japanese goods from entering, the countermeasures should be to establish economic diplomacy as an urgent task. (3) To establish these countermeasures, the newly requested 29 million for the next fiscal year is necessary. With this perspective, Foreign Minister Hirota will soon discuss with the heads of related departments and order Deputy Minister Shigemitsu and other bureau chiefs to draft specific proposals.

<h3 id="e26">Japan's Next Year's Budget Will Issue 1 Billion in Bonds <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The budget for the next fiscal year is inflated due to the establishment of extraordinary national policies. The plan to increase taxes to supplement the financial resources could not be realized due to Finance Minister Takahashi's opposition. Therefore, most of the financial resources for the next fiscal year still depend on the issuance of public bonds. The issuance amount of new public bonds for the next fiscal year will be the same as this year, seemingly no less than 1 billion yen. If so, the total amount of public debt, which has already exceeded 7 billion, will reach 8 billion yen. Within the next two or three years, it may exceed 10 billion yen. Therefore, political and financial circles are concerned about whether such a huge amount of public bonds can be sold in the Japanese market. However, Finance Minister Takahashi is very optimistic, believing that there is no need to worry and that it is possible to sell about 1 billion in public bonds next year. However, Finance Minister Takahashi is also carefully considering the future of public bonds and recently ordered the authorities to investigate the following matters: What is the status of public bonds issued during extraordinary times? How is the increase in Japan's national wealth related to the amount of public bonds issued since the tenth year of Meiji? How is the relationship between national wealth and the tax burden of the people and other public levies? How is the situation of national wealth, public debt, and taxes compared with Britain and other countries? (Dentsu Telegram, 1st)</p>

<p>Industrial Production and Demand Approaching Equilibrium</p>
<p>Millions Will Find Work by the End of the Year</p>
<p>Relief Funds of 330 Million Yuan</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, US presidential advisors claimed that the quantity of US industrial production is rapidly adjusting to the quantity of demand, and the implementation of industry codes has been seen in major industries. The return of prosperity in the autumn in various industries is also satisfactory. The reaction of the business community in recent weeks is completely in accordance with regulations, which is the natural result of manufacturers rushing to produce large quantities before increasing wages and other costs in compliance with industry codes, similar to importers rushing to import large quantities before the implementation of new taxes. As a result, production exceeded consumption. Now that industry codes have been implemented and production costs have increased, the quantity of production will be closer and closer to actual demand. Therefore, it is believed that from now on, a closer relationship will develop between production and consumption.</p>
<p>As for unemployment relief, although the president has a major relief plan, progress in getting the unemployed back to work is not slow. It is estimated that by the end of this year, several million more American men and women workers will find work again. In terms of relief, the president will use the planned funds of 330 million yuan to purchase food and fuel to help the poor when necessary, and the relief funds for various cities will be of the same amount. This can be used to purchase large quantities of necessities and allow manufacturers to re-employ laborers to engage in production to fill this need.</p>
<p>The Industrial Recovery Administration also feels the situation is greatly improved and pointed out that Douglas Southall Freeman's recent weekly economic report stated that the country is building a greater economic security than ever before as proof.</p>
<p>As for what the president will advocate for the new currency policy, Washington is not talking about it much today. When White House advisors were asked whether gold dollars would be revalued, they only pointed to the statement issued a week ago that there were no new developments regarding currency inflation. Generally, observers still expect the US president to rely on inflation, credit, and large government purchases of materials to promote the progress of various industries.

<p>(New York) The steel company's coal mines will also follow the coal industry code, which will allow 100,000 striking miners and steelworkers to immediately return to work. The situation in Pennsylvania is also improving. The 5,800 striking miners who walked to Clairton yesterday have now stopped preventing Carnegie Steel workers from going to work and have returned home. The main problem in the national labor unrest is the recognition of labor unions, which has not yet been resolved and is causing anxiety. More than 10,000 workers employed by Weirton Steel have gone on strike because the company fired several workers affiliated with the union and threatened to ask the government to intervene if the company does not recognize the union. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(New York) After studying the coal mine situation in western Pennsylvania, personnel from the National Recovery Administration believe that the agreement regarding the steel company's coal mines is not fully satisfactory and cannot allow all miners to return to work. Although Administrator Johnson is still recovering in the hospital, he has convened representatives of coal miners and steel company coal mines to meet immediately in order to resolve their dispute. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(New York) American Federation of Labor President Green today advised workers not to strike easily and not to use this as a last resort. He said that if workers have grievances, they should first use the national or state labor bureau. If there is no result, then there can be grounds for a strike, but before striking, it must be deeply considered. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e29">British Financial Progress <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(London) The just-completed half-year statistics of the Treasury Department show great progress in British finances. The national income for the half-year is £275,736,000, the expenditure is £324,326,000, and the deficit is £48,590,000. Compared with the half-year deficit figures for many years, this is the lowest record. The expenditure in the first half of the fiscal year has always exceeded the income because the country's major funds must be received in the last quarter, i.e., the period from January to March. Therefore, the reduction in the difference between income and expenditure in the first half of the year is a very promising sign. If the national income in the next six months does not decrease significantly, then the Chancellor of the Exchequer will definitely have a budget surplus in April next year to reduce taxes.

<p>To Be Held in Washington on October 5th</p>
<p>Britain Will Propose Paying One-Tenth</p>
<p>(London) According to extremely reliable sources here, negotiations between Britain and the United States on war debts will begin in Washington on October 5th. It is heard that the British delegation will propose to set the amount of war debts owed by Britain to the United States at 80 million pounds, and this amount is only one-tenth of the amount formally owed by Britain. Therefore, this can only be regarded as a kind of acknowledgement of the debt obligations to the country. Britain had this plan when it previously paid part of the war debt, and it is still not deviating from this policy. At that time, US President Roosevelt unconditionally accepted the suggestion, but he could not make the decision himself and had to go through Congress. (Kuo-Min Agency Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>Stating That Shipbuilding Is Not Aimed at Japan</p>
<p>Honolulu US Secretary of the Navy Swanson stated that there are no special plans in the US shipbuilding plan that are specifically related to the Pacific. Swanson, who is inspecting naval bases, arrived here this morning aboard the cruiser Minneapolis and will stay for several days before returning to the Pacific coast. Swanson has verified that the United States will build ships to meet the limits of the London Treaty and will maintain this strength thereafter, saying that this plan is only because the government firmly believes that maintaining a suitable navy is the best guarantee of peace. There is no other important meaning. Since there are treaties that stipulate certain limits for major powers, these limits should be maintained. If other countries also build ships according to these limits, the United States will not object. Swanson also made a special statement fearing that this was related to US-Japan relations: "Our relationship with Japan is the most friendly, and it will remain so in the future, without a doubt." He also said that there is only one item in the shipbuilding plan that is specifically related to the Pacific, namely the construction of two gunboats to travel to the Yangtze River. His visit to Honolulu is just a routine matter and has no international significance. (Kuo-Min Agency Telegram, 30th)</p>

The Cuban president has denied this, saying that the army's concurrent control of the police is only for the purpose of concentrating government power. However, the Presidential Palace is still under strict military guard at this time, and small rebellions are also breaking out in the provinces. Although they are immediately dispersed by the military police, the situation is still difficult to stabilize. The Communist Party is also demanding the president's resignation, claiming that it will organize a new revolutionary group, so the government believes that it is powerless and does not pay much attention to it.

<p>Simla: On the third day of discussions between Seymourra and the delegates, the meeting commenced at 11:00 AM today. The chief Indian representative, Bu Ya, attended for the first time since recovering from his illness. Japan began by announcing its commitment to the proposed agreement for a one-month extension of the existing Indo-Japanese treaty. Subsequently, the Japanese plenipotentiary, Sawada, requested a 75% reduction in cotton cloth tariffs. The Indian side did not raise any questions and is currently considering the proposal. Following the meeting, both delegations issued the following statement: Indo-Japanese representatives met on the 30th at the council hall. All representatives, except for the education, health, and land officials, attended. They continued deliberating on the conclusion of the Indo-Japanese trade treaty, which included discussing the possibility of extending the existing treaty. Both sides hope to conclude a new treaty to replace the existing one, without harming bilateral trade relations. As the current treaty will expire on October 10th, it was mutually acknowledged that the negotiations could not be finalized before the expiry date. Therefore, India proposed extending the current treaty for one month, with further extensions to be considered based on the progress of negotiations. The Japanese representatives declared their commitment to this proposal. This agreement will be formally implemented through diplomatic documents. Additionally, the Japanese representatives presented a proposal regarding cotton products, which is currently under consideration by the Indian delegation. The next meeting is scheduled for October 3rd at 10:00 AM. (30th, Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>Simla: Regarding the contents of the proposal made by the Japanese side in yesterday’s Indo-Japanese talks concerning cotton products, reliable sources suggest the following: (1) Reduce the tariff of 75% to 50%, based on the level before the increase in June; (2) If India recognizes this reduction, Japan is prepared to consider the following points in the spirit of mutual concessions: A. Japan will purchase a fixed quantity of Indian cotton; B. If unregulated exports of Japanese cotton cloth threaten Indian domestic industries, Japan will implement export controls to prevent this. The reasons given by the Japanese side for requesting a reduction of the 75% cotton cloth tariff to 50% are roughly as follows: (1) Indian tariffs are not revenue tariffs but protective tariffs. Therefore, from this perspective, setting a rate of 25% for the UK and 75% for Japan, with a 50% difference, is inappropriate and equal tariffs should be imposed; (2) Even considering the low value of the Japanese yen, a 50% difference between the UK and Japan is still inappropriate. The cost of cotton cloth consists of 60% raw cotton and 40% processing fees. Given the current exchange rate with the UK, which is 40% lower, Japanese cotton cloth is cheaper than British goods by 40% of the processing fee (40%), or 16% of the original price. If we add the 10% differential tariff stipulated in the Ottawa Agreement, making the difference 26%, Japan can still tolerate it. According to this calculation, the tariff is 25% for British goods and 51% for Japanese goods. (1st, Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<p>Reached a maximum altitude of 19,000 meters</p>
<p>Proving Previous Theoretical Calculations to Be Accurate</p>
<p>Scientific Observations in the Stratosphere Possible</p>
<p>(Moscow) The giant "Soviet" aircraft (approximately 60 feet tall) safely landed on the banks of the Moscow River near Kolomna at 5:00 PM today. The flight lasted eight hours and fifteen minutes, reaching a maximum altitude of 19,000 meters. After completing final preparations overnight, the ascent began at 8:40 AM this morning, with an ascent rate of nearly twelve meters per second. The aircraft reached an altitude of 15,000 meters by 9:22 AM, and its maximum altitude of 19,000 meters at 12:50 PM, after which it began its descent and landed safely. All equipment remained intact. The landing site was near the Kolomensky plant, 115 kilometers from the departure point.</p>
<p>Perfect Balloon System: The aircraft's director transmitted radio messages during the flight, allowing the airfield to understand the aircraft's overall situation. The transmitted messages praised the machinery installed inside and outside the cabin, and reported the results of temperature and pressure changes. The on-board staff sent a telegram expressing their satisfaction with the perfection of the balloon and its equipment, and conveyed their gratitude to all the workers in the factory who participated in the manufacture of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Following a comprehensive review of the flight's performance, more than 2,000 workers from nearby factories and collective farmers gathered to welcome the team. A large meeting was convened, during which the aviators shared their impressions of the flight with the growing crowd of workers and farmers. They summarized the flight's results as follows: The aircraft remained in the air for eight hours and fifteen minutes, reaching an unprecedented altitude of 19,000 meters. The lowest recorded external temperature was -67 degrees Celsius, while the highest temperature inside the cabin reached 30 degrees Celsius. This high temperature was due to the sun's rays not being attenuated by the atmosphere. The climate fell to five millimeters of mercury. They also stated that the flight proved the accuracy of all previous theoretical calculations and demonstrated the possibility of conducting normal scientific observations in the stratosphere. They solemnly declared that such flights could be repeated in winter. The aircraft equipment and scientific research instruments manufactured by Soviet factories demonstrated their excellent quality, allowing all planned scientific research projects to be fully implemented.</p>
<p>Exceeding Previous Records: They concluded by saying that this flight could be compared to world records but, regarding the actual scientific tasks they completed, they had surpassed previous records. They were extremely comfortable throughout the entire flight and planned to repeat their experience.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Letters and Telegrams from All Sectors: After landing, they sent a letter to Stalin summarizing the flight's achievements and affirming their commitment to continuing this work. These courageous aviators received congratulations from many sectors for their great achievements. Officials from the military and civil aviation sectors, leading workers, farmers, and Red Army soldiers sent letters praising the flight as a fusion of excellent scientific preparation and Bolshevik courage. The world altitude record set by this balloon and the valuable scientific materials acquired by its crew were a great contribution to Soviet science. The Society for the Promotion of Defense and Aviation Chemical Industries extended its congratulations for their outstanding achievements and the creation of a new world record, stating that the victory should be attributed to the remarkable determination and courage of the Soviet aviators.

Among the seven, a man named Bale is one of the most dangerous gangsters in the United States. The sentence will be announced next week. O'Shiel was released after a ransom of 75,000 was paid. Also, the six bandits who kidnapped the 70-year-old banker, Mr. Luo Ou, were sentenced today, ranging from life imprisonment to five years. The jurors deliberated for forty-one hours. It is reported that among the key criminals in this case, two are men and one is a woman. The jurors decided to sentence the two male criminals to death, but some did not advocate for the death penalty for the female criminal. However, it was not appropriate to impose different penalties for the same crime, so it was ultimately decided to sentence all three to life imprisonment. (30th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain geologist surveyed and found that the United States has 4.2 trillion tons of high-quality ore, the United Kingdom has 1.3 trillion tons, and France has 3.3 trillion tons. The total amount of ore in China, calculated only for high-quality and easily extractable ore, is currently known to be 400 billion tons. The United States currently uses an average of 0.25 tons of iron per person per year, which is not enough for three years. However, although European and American countries are rich in iron ore, the quantity of large-scale manganese ore is not very high. Japan can mine only 60 billion tons of iron ore, Korea 110 billion tons, and Australia 130 billion tons. China's eastern regions, with convenient transportation, have more than 400 billion tons of extractable iron ore. However, the rich iron ore in the Northeast has been obtained by Japan, and China has lost almost half of its better iron ore, which is heartbreaking to speak of. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e82">The Puppet State Prepares to Demarcate Its Border with Russia <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Tensions Rise Sharply as Japan and Russia Prepare for War</p>
<p>Russian Consul General in Harbin Recalled</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: The Soviet government is actively expanding its military preparations along the northeastern border, in preparation for war with Japan. The Japanese side and the authorities of the puppet state are paying close attention. The puppet Foreign Ministry has drafted an outline to demarcate the border with Russia to prevent the advance of Russian troops. However, the Soviet Union is unwilling to compromise on this matter, which may increase disputes. The following is an exploration of the outline proposed by the puppet state to Russia regarding the demarcation of the border, and the key points of contention between Russia and the puppet state:</p>
<p>The outline proposed by the puppet state states that the current state of the border line from Manzhouli in western Manchuria to the Argun River, the Ussuri River which flows into the Heilongjiang, and the eastern Russo-Puppet border are largely based on the Treaty of Beijing of 1860. Subsequent agreements such as the Xingkai Lake Treaty (1861), the Mohe Gold Mine Incident (1885), the Hunchun Border Treaty (1886), the Spring Bandit Incident (1900), the Qiqihar Agreement (1911), and the Harbin Protocol (1929) are all considered by the puppet state to have been tacitly approved under duress by China. It proposes to revise the agreement method in two points: (1) According to the Karakhan Declaration, abolish the old treaties of the Tsarist Russian era and restore the treaty of 1689, thus the Russo-Puppet border extends north to the Stanovoy Range and east to the coastal region reaching the Sea of Japan. (2) According to the existing treaties, first determine the general border. Therefore, within its scope, a local agreement must be made to confirm the border line of the puppet state. The following issues are particularly important points of contention between Russia and the puppet state regarding the above agreement: (1) The Ujiang estuary delta issue, which was recognized as Chinese territory in the Treaty of Beijing, is a militarily important location, but Soviet Russia now arbitrarily claims it as its own territory. (2) The Sixty-Four Villages East of the River issue, the area from the mouth of the Liya River to the Furmaojin Village within Soviet Russian territory. According to the Treaty of Aigun, the puppet state's administrative power was to be confirmed. (3) The Manzhouli issue in the west, according to the Qiqihar Agreement, a detailed agreement has been completed. However, during the Sino-Russian dispute, Soviet Russia tested its strength and entered Chinese territory. The puppet state demands a withdrawal to the agreed line. (4) Recently, Soviet Russia has expanded its military preparations on the Far Eastern border. The Japanese and puppet states believe that there is indeed preparation for war. The relationship between Russia and the puppet state is gradually cracking. The Japanese and puppet states are also preparing for defense during this period.</p>
<p>As Japanese and Russian military preparations become increasingly active, a satisfactory resolution through negotiations between the two sides is impossible. Recently, the Japanese arrested a Russian engineer from the Eastern Railway in Harbin, which also indicates a break with Russia. Soviet Consul General to Harbin, Slavatinsky, boarded the third-class carriage attached to the third Harbin-Manzhouli train at 3:25 pm on the 23rd of last month and left alone for the north. More than 20 people, including Russian directors and supervisors of the Eastern Railway and the director of the Railway Bureau, Ludayev, welcomed him at the station. The stationmaster specially opened the VIP room to entertain him. According to Slavatinsky's statement to the passport inspector, he was summoned back to his country. However, at a time when all Soviet Russian issues and negotiations are tense, Slavatinsky's sudden departure from Harbin to return to his country has attracted a great deal of attention from all parties.

<p>Japanese Planes Fly for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Enter Xinglong</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's troops had great ambitions for this southern advance, but their attacks on Gaoliying and Tangshan were repelled. It is reported that they have turned to Changping and Nankou, planning to retreat west across the Ping绥 Railway. The night before last (28th), more than 200 cavalrymen of Fang's army led by Mi Dexin arrived at the Ming Tombs from Xingshou. Fang and Ji also led more than 4,000 troops each, and arrived at Laojuntang, Dawa, and Jieshan in Changping County from Qincheng and Pingyi. Fang and Ji commanded from Laojuntang, planning to attack Changping. Yesterday morning (29th), the vanguard advanced to Daxiaohongmen. The Beiping authorities had already stationed heavy troops in the Changping area. Daxiaohongmen was guarded by Luo Qi's brigade of Huang Jie's division. After hearing the alarm, they immediately launched an attack. From morning to dusk, Fang and Ji's troops charged several times, but failed each time. The fighting did not stop into the night. Gunfire could be heard clearly in Changping city. The city gates were closed at 6:00 PM and a special curfew was imposed. At night, Fang and Ji used plainclothes troops to attack Luo's brigade's position at Daxiaohongmen. Luo's brigade repelled the plainclothes troops on one hand, and attacked Fang and Ji's position on the other. As a result, Fang and Ji's troops returned to the Ming Tombs and Laojuntang. Today (30th), Fang and Ji's troops are still in the Ming Tombs, Dalingyuan, Laojuntang, Nanbeizhuang, Shangxiayuan, and Changling areas. The outposts are only two li apart from Luo's brigade. Skirmishes occur from time to time.</p>
<p>Under the pretext of preventing Fang and Ji's troops from returning to the war zone, a Japanese plane flew to Changping city again at 2:00 PM yesterday for aerial reconnaissance, circling several times before flying east. At 3:00 PM, a heavy bomb was dropped on Beishangzhuang Village in Tangshan, the sound of which could be heard for several li. At about 8:00 AM this morning, another Japanese plane flew to Nankou for reconnaissance, circling for more than ten minutes before flying towards the Ming Tombs. When passing Taipingzhuang, two bombs were dropped, causing considerable damage to the residents. Japanese planes arbitrarily conduct reconnaissance and drop bombs in our country's territory, infringing on our airspace sovereignty and harming the lives and property of our people. The Beiping authorities have lodged a protest, but the Japanese side has not paid attention. The Japanese disregard for our country has reached its extreme.</p>
<p>Japanese troops have re-entered Huairou and reached the Niulanshan and Banqiao villages, with no intention of withdrawing for the time being. Today, a company of Japanese troops and a battalion of puppet troops also arrived in Xinglong County, claiming to the local security team that they were there to protect the Qing imperial tombs and intended to enter the city. This was rejected by our security team. The Japanese and puppet troops did not insist because the reason for requesting entry into the city was not sufficient, and temporarily stationed at a location four li away from the city.

<p>Han's Inspection of Various Counties Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Will Strive to Seek Welfare for the People Thereafter</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, departed on September 17th to inspect various counties in Jiaodong. He arrived in Jimo County at 9:00 AM on the 29th. Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie and Jiaojiao Railway Committee Chairman Ge Guangting also rushed from Qingdao to Jimo to welcome him. After Han arrived, he rested briefly and then summoned all public officials in the county to give a speech. After the speech, he summoned five bandits from the prison for interrogation. The bandits admitted to kidnapping without denying. Han then ordered them to be taken to the execution ground and shot. Han originally intended to take a train west from Jimo to return to Jinan due to his long inspection tour. However, Mayor Shen and Committee Chairman Ge insisted on inviting him to Qingdao for a visit. Han could not refuse and traveled by car to Qingdao at 4:30 PM yesterday (29th). Most of his staff took a train from Chengyang to Jiaoxian to wait for him to travel west together. Those who came to Qingdao with Han included Zhang Liansheng, Cheng Xixian, Han Xiuyan, and Sha Yuebo, along with more than a hundred followers. The city government used the Guest House as Han's temporary residence. That evening, Mayor Shen held a banquet at the Guest House to welcome Han. This morning (30th) at around 9:00 AM, Shen accompanied Han to visit the Qianhai New Pier, the Dagang Wharf, the Huiquan Sports Field, the Seaside Park, the Aquarium, and the Seaside Bathing Beach. This afternoon, Committee Chairman Ge held a banquet to entertain him. He is scheduled to take the Jiaozhou Railway train west tomorrow morning. According to Han's conversation, he said, "This tour of various counties in Jiaodong is something that I should do within my responsibilities. From my point of view, the results of the inspection are not satisfactory. The local construction and the lives of farmers urgently need to be improved. There are also many backlogs in the litigation of various counties. The gentry in urban and rural areas arbitrarily control local affairs and must be reformed vigorously. However, Zhang Liyuan, the magistrate of Wendeng County, is still willing to work hard, and the handling of county affairs is very orderly. He has been given a merit once for commendation. The counties in Jiaodong were formerly the garrison area of Liu Zhennian's army, and local undertakings have been severely damaged. After Liu left, although the provincial government dispatched county magistrates to reorganize, there has been no progress in political affairs. Moreover, local undertakings rely entirely on national support. If the politics of a country does not get on track, no matter how hard local undertakings work, there will be no great results. In the future, I will strive to reorganize and reform what I have learned from the inspection and think is unsatisfactory, in order to seek genuine benefits for the people. I will set off west tonight and will inspect the garrison when I arrive in Gaomi, Jiaoxian, which will be slightly delayed. Otherwise, I will not stay along the way and will return directly to Jinan. The flood in western Shandong this time is extremely tragic. The central government has already allocated 100,000 yuan, and the provincial government has successively allocated more than 300,000 yuan for emergency relief. The disaster victims have been resettled. I am also very grateful for the large sums of money donated by all walks of life in Tianjin and Shanghai. The breach in the Yellow River this winter will be repaired and blocked completely." (September 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Ancient Han Tomb Discovered in Teng County <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Fifty to Sixty Pieces of Stone Carvings and Han Portraits</p>
<p>Provincial Library Decides to Transport to Jinan for Preservation</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Teng County, Shandong, was the ancient capital of the State of Teng during the Warring States period, and the literary style was very prosperous. It has been more than 2,000 years since then. Recently, ancient bronze and stone inscriptions have been discovered one after another, with valuable value, which is an important evidence for archeology. It is indeed the only treasure house in Qi and Lu. The Shandong Ancient Sites Research Association of the Academia Sinica is preparing to excavate the important land in the county to explore ancient architecture and culture. It will send personnel to investigate soon to start. A large-scale ancient Han tomb was discovered in the county a month ago, with stone carvings of Han portraits, which is of great importance to national literature. According to the Shandong Provincial Library, the ancient Han tomb is full of stone carvings of Han portraits. After being excavated by nearby people, a total of fifty to sixty pieces were obtained. At that time, because a group of people knew that they were treasures, they fought endlessly. In the end, the gentry Huang Futang transported them to his personal home for temporary preservation. The people of Teng County have been in an uproar for days. The number of visitors every day has made the threshold worn through. According to Wang Xiantang, curator of the Provincial Library, the Han portrait stone carvings discovered in Teng County are of great value. Because Teng County is no different from the treasure house of Shandong, Han portrait stone carvings can be found almost everywhere. Unfortunately, a group of people do not know its relationship and value, and do not preserve it. Or use it to repair roads, or use it to build bridges. The foundations of houses and walls are interspersed with this treasure, which is lamentable. Most of the Han portrait stone carvings discovered in the past were fragmented and incomplete buildings. The ancient Han tomb discovered this time is extremely large and is a kind of public cemetery. It is still possible to arrange the collected portrait stone carvings into a complete stone tomb, which can be used to study the ancient tombs and the system of matching Han portrait stone carvings, which is of great relationship to Chinese cultural history. What is a pity is that this ancient tomb was excavated by people, and the arrangement of the Han portrait stone carvings in the tomb and the Han Dynasty's coffin situation cannot be examined. And the Han corpses and other items were scattered by nearby people and cannot be recovered, which is a great regret. It has been decided to transport the stone carvings to Jinan for preservation, and it is too inappropriate for the people to freely excavate ancient tombs. It is proposed to submit a request to the authorities to strictly prohibit excavation in order to protect the ancient sites. (September 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Yuan Liang's Reply to the Ping Municipal Council Letter <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>-Explains the Death of Liang Jiayi-</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Yuan Liang, Mayor of Beiping, explained the facts of the death of Liang Jiayi, the district chief of the tenth district of the city, in a hospital. The Municipal Council issued a telegram with some criticisms. He specially listed the facts on September 22nd and sent a letter to explain. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully, I have recently read in the newspaper that your council, on the date of this month, telegraphed the central government regarding the case of Liang Jiayi, the district chief of the tenth autonomous region of this city, who was accused of operating for personal gain and smoking opium and was ordered to be investigated. He went to the Guanwai Hospital affiliated to the Public Security Bureau for medical examination and died due to phlegm obstruction. The telegram stated that Liang Jiayi, the district chief of the tenth district of this city, was ordered by the municipal government to go to the hospital for investigation and died suddenly, etc. After the telegrams from the various districts and neighborhoods were filed, the councilors of the district, together with the representatives of the district chiefs and district residents, believed that the district chief was not addicted to smoking and was indeed the fact. If he was not released after the deadline, it would be suspected of private detention. The application for withdrawal by the original informant and the guarantee of responsibility by the representatives of the district residents were not allowed, which was obviously intended to frame the person. Such trampling on personality and abuse of power should be subject to administrative punishment. If he was detained intentionally without any preference, it would lead to a tragic death and should be subject to criminal sanctions. As the head of the administrative department of a city, such measures would be difficult to lead to the promotion of democracy. The council felt that the grief of the city's districts and neighborhoods was unusual and feared that it would cause trouble. Therefore, at the meeting, Mayor Yuan Liang was asked to attend the meeting to explain according to law in the hope of avoiding the expansion of the situation. After repeated requests, he did not attend, etc., and Council Chairman Dong Yi also informed him in person. This telegram has been sent to investigate. The City Council is a deliberative body, and its exercise of powers has a legal scope. I do not know on what power the council's resolution to send the above telegram is based. Moreover, the investigation of the telegram shows that the facts are obliterated and arbitrary criticisms are made, which is deeply shocking. The government received the case of Liang Jiayi, the district chief of the tenth district, who was accused by Xie Jingpu and Wang Lu, representatives of the district chiefs of the district, of operating for personal gain and smoking opium on August 11th of this year. Because the accusations involved autonomous personnel violating the law and dereliction of duty, the truth should be thoroughly investigated. The inspector of the government, Qian Huayu, was sent to investigate. However, Liang Jiayi refused and claimed that he would defend the accusations in writing. However, he delayed for a long time and did not fulfill it. It was not until August 30th that the government ordered the personnel to come to the government within three days to listen to being sent to the hospital for inspection in accordance with Articles 4 and 9, Paragraph 3 of the Regulations on the Transfer of Public Servants for Inspection. During this period, Xie Jingpu et al. stated on September 2nd that the case had been investigated by Li Ruiting, the supervisory committee member of the district and the district, and Song Meiran, the representative of the district residents, and proved that Liang Jiayi had no illegal behavior or smoking opium. Why did the application for revocation only come after the government's order to transfer for inspection was issued? The application was approved because the accusation involved autonomous personnel violating the law and dereliction of duty. The truth should be thoroughly investigated. It is not like a criminal case involving a private prosecution that can be revoked at will. If the persons submitting the statement admit that Liang Jiayi has no illegal behavior, then the previous accusation is a false accusation, and the law should be reversed. The request for revocation was rejected. Later, Liang Jiayi submitted a statement that the district resident representative Yu Song Meiran and three people, including the supervisory committee member of the first neighborhood, proved that he did not smoke opium. He requested exemption from inspection and requested a four-day leave to go to Tianjin to take care of his brother's funeral, but he left without approval. The so-called district resident representative Liu Ruoyu et al. proved that he was not addicted to smoking, and he did not submit a guarantee in accordance with the law. Only the personnel's one-sided statement was not approved. On September 8th, the personnel was suspended in accordance with the law, and the Public Security Bureau was ordered to enforce it. On the 10th of this month, the personnel stated in the report that he obeyed the order and went to the Guanwai Hospital outside the city on the 11th to listen to the inspection. The government ordered the Public Security Bureau to forward the order to Jing Yong, the director of the Guanwai Hospital, to be responsible for the inspection, and sent Wang Jinghuai, the director of the Hygiene Section of the bureau, to supervise. No report has been received. On the morning of the 19th, the bureau reported that Liang Jiayi died this morning and that the examination was caused by phlegm obstruction. This is the process of the government handling the case of Liang Jiayi being accused of smoking opium. As for the section on encroaching on public funds, it has also been verified by personnel. Liang Jiayi has not submitted a calculation book to the government for examination for the public funds of the district since January of this year. All public funds account books were taken home for misappropriation and storage, owing 100 yuan for food for the people and office expenses, and 50 yuan for the district residents' meeting expenses. He also owed rent to Dong Rong, a citizen, but did not pay. The expenditure calculation book has already been reported. Such illegal acts have been verified. Is the government, as the highest supervisory authority in the city, required to investigate in accordance with the law? The facts are there, and there is no need to say more. According to the statement of your council's telegram, it is believed that the district chief is not addicted to smoking and is indeed the fact. Before the inspection report is signed, I do not know what it is based on. Xie Jing, the district resident representative of the district, accused the district chief of smoking opium, and the government's inspector also inquired about it. According to Li Yimin, the director of the affairs office of the district office, District Chief Liang used to have an opium addiction and is currently taking medicine. The government is handling the case in accordance with the law based on the accusation. How can it be said that it is deliberately trying to convict or deliberately detaining him? The section on not releasing him after the deadline is even more wrong. According to Article 8 of the Regulations on the Transfer of Inspectors in Various Provinces and Cities of the Central Government, the inspection period is from five to ten days. Liang Jiayi was in the hospital for only eight days. How can he not be released after the deadline? As for the section on the district residents' representatives being responsible for the guarantee, I do not know who came to the government to submit the guarantee. Even if Liang Jiayi came to submit the statement, he only said that Liu Ruoyu et al. were willing to testify, but he did not submit a letter of guarantee to the government. Can it be approved in accordance with the law? Your council is a representative body of the people of the city and should take the immediate interests of all the people as the premise. However, a district chief who has been found to have violated the law and dereliction of duty has been killed by disease. Therefore, the facts are obliterated and arbitrary criticisms are made in an attempt to expand the situation for the sake of quickness. I am afraid that this is not the intention of the people of the city. If the mayor did not respond to your council's request to attend the meeting to explain as an excuse, the power to make resolutions stipulated in the Municipal Council Organization Law is listed very clearly. This time, the government handled administrative cases in accordance with its powers, and the councilors of the district submitted proposals based on the statements of the district chiefs and district residents, which has exceeded the matters that should be discussed. Not attending is a respect for the rule of law. The council's resolution to send the telegram is based on what power. The facts of the case are listed accordingly, and you are requested to check and reply quickly. Best regards to the Beiping Municipal Council, Yuan Liang.</p>

<p>The Municipal Management Committee held its 151st Standing Committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Gu Shuzhi. Resolutions: 1. Tonghui Road is an important road to Tonghubin. Now, after the autumn rains, water accumulates in depressions and is uneven. The low-lying areas should be filled and paved with coal cinder immediately, and the roads on both sides should be tidied up. The cost is estimated at 500 yuan. From the east of Wuqiao to the Houqi Road intersection, a plan for filling the earth and building a stone road will be carried out immediately. In addition to donations from various households, the committee will be responsible for 1,000 yuan. A letter will be sent to the county government to transfer to the Municipal Engineering Office to estimate and carry out. 2. The Provincial Education College plans to pave a Jinshan stone road with a width of one zhang and a length of 162 zhang and 6 chi from the Sheqiao head. The committee will subsidize 160 yuan in accordance with the regulations. 3. Zhu Meiliang took over 20 mu of Longchuanbangdang grain of Yanshou Temple outside the East Gate, which is not an official wasteland. It is related to the city property. The committee should prepare funds and recover it according to the original price of the land occupied by the Zhu family. 4. Wuqiao has been in disrepair for a long time. Recently, I heard that the Wuxi-Yixing long-distance bus will be opened soon. This bridge is a must-pass road, and driving is dangerous. The company should be informed to repair it properly. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Appeal Rejected in Case of Widow's Abortion <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Shen Jiang Fengying, a widow from Tianzhutang Street outside the North Gate of the county, had an affair with Wang Genquan, a neighbor, and became pregnant. On February 6th of this year, she entrusted Gu Jichang, a trauma doctor from Yuan Road inside the Guangfu Gate, to perform an abortion. After the abortion, complications occurred, and she was bedridden. After Gu Jichang heard the news, he entrusted Sun Xingzhuang, an internist, to treat her. On March 1st, Shen Jiang Fengying died in Gu Jichang's home. Cao Shengquan, the post police officer of the first branch of the Public Security Bureau, and Tao Shougen, the landlord, reported to the first branch of the bureau. Gu Jichang was detained by the bureau and transferred to the County Public Security Bureau. Sun Xingzhuang was also summoned to the bureau and transferred to the County Court. The chief, Bao, the forensic doctor, and Wang, the inspector, went to inspect. It was found that she died of illness after an abortion. After the investigation by the Procuratorate, the case was transferred to the Criminal Court. Gu Jichang was sentenced to three years in prison for abortion, fined 200 yuan, and sentenced to three years in prison and fined 200 yuan for smoking opium. Gu's wife, Ding, was fined 100 yuan for the crime of possessing opium with the intention of providing it to others for smoking. Sun Xingzhuang was fined 200 yuan for smoking opium. Gu Jichang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court. After the High Court's trial, it was found that Gu had no reason at all, and the appeal was rejected.</p>

<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, came to Shanghai this time to meet with Song Ziwen and Huang Fu to discuss various issues such as the central and North China finances. A considerable solution has been agreed upon. It was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing yesterday morning, but Dr. Noel from Yander Medical arrived at the residence at 7:00 AM to see him, requiring a little rest. He and Zeng Zhongming, the Vice Minister of Railways, and others took the night train to Nanjing last night, which was attached with a sleeper car. Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Rectification Committee, also went to Beiping to preside over the affairs, the details of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Fu's Trip to the North: Wang Jingwei met with Huang Fu a few days ago to discuss various political affairs in North China and urged him to go north as soon as possible. Huang immediately agreed to go to Nanjing by the same train. Huang was about to go north. Wang's residence telegraphed the Railway Bureau yesterday afternoon, requesting two PMCL-2 sleeper cars to be attached to the 11:00 PM night train for the two to ride. The North Station and the Zhenru Station were heavily guarded by the railway police and security teams. Wu Shaozeng, the Deputy Director of the two Railway Bureaus, Director Mo Heng, and Shen Yi, the Director of the Works Bureau, were all at the station to welcome them and take care of everything. Huang Fu arrived at the station with six attendants at 10:40 and boarded sleeper car No. 2, and met with Deputy Director Wu and others who came to welcome him. Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Secretary-General Yu Hongjun also arrived, boarded the car, and talked. Yu got out of the car first, and Mayor Wu followed the car to Zhenru in order to welcome President Wang. At exactly 11 o'clock, with a whistle, the car slowly left the station.</p>
<p>Wang also Returns to Nanjing: Before the train traveled far, President Wang and the Railway Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming arrived at the station at that time. The station guard raised a red light to stop the train. Wang boarded sleeper car No. 1. Mayor Wu also came out of sleeper car No. 2, shook hands with Wang, and saw him off. When the train stopped suddenly, the voices were noisy and passengers did not know the reason, so they peered out the windows. After Wang boarded the train, the passengers returned to their seats, and the train slowly drove off again. Those who went to Nanjing last night also included Tang Youren, Zhu Jiahua, and Wang Yitang.</p>
<p>Huang's Speech: Huang Fu met with reporters at his residence at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. According to him, the North China financial problem has been completely resolved after repeated consultations with Executive Yuan President Wang, Minister of Finance Song, etc. In the future, all income in North China will be remitted to the Central Government for disposal and will no longer be distributed by the local government itself, so that the national finances can be unified. Huang continued to talk about the steps to reorganize the political affairs in North China. The most important ones are the following two points. The first is to stabilize people's hearts. Now the people's hearts in North China have gradually stabilized. From now on, it should be changed to boosting people's morale. The second is to find ways to stabilize the economy. Under the political and various circumstances in North China, economic stability is the only prerequisite at present. If economic stability cannot be achieved, then everything else will be difficult to start, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Sun Ke Discussed Financial Relief Measures <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Military and Political Expenses Fall Short by Ten Million Per Month</p>
<p>Meeting at Song's Residence to Address Urgent Needs First</p>
<p>The Entire Problem Still Needs Lengthy Discussion</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence at 9:00 yesterday morning. He talked about the content of the meeting at Song's residence the day before, saying that the current monthly military and political expenses of the Central Government fall short of the budget by as much as 10 million yuan. The financial authorities are having difficulty raising funds, the political authorities say that there is nothing more to reduce in terms of staff and administrative reductions, and the military authorities say that military spending cannot be delayed during the active suppression of bandits. Therefore, all parties have a very difficult situation. The results of the meeting the day before have yielded relief measures, but they can only cope with the temporary situation. Permanent plans still require lengthy discussions and reducing military spending. Sun also answered reporters' questions, saying that he did not know the mission of Kong Xiangxi's flight to Jiangxi to see Chiang Kai-shek the afternoon before, but he knew that Kong had planned to go earlier, but it was delayed until yesterday (i.e., the day before) before he set off. As for Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Song Meiling, coming to Shanghai, she was not carrying any mission either.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Mayor Wu Assumed Concurrent Position This Morning <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>But No Ceremony Was Held</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, was ordered to concurrently serve as the Garrison Commander of Songhu. Wu went to the Garrison Command this morning at 10:00 to take up his duties. It is reported that Wu's appointment as the Garrison Commander this time is a temporary concurrent position, so he will not formally take office for the time being. However, after holding a memorial week, he will meet with all the staff. Wu has not changed any of the Garrison Command staff in order to maintain familiarity.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Mayor Wu Will Request the Central Government to Retain the Municipal Councilors <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Shi Liangcai, the Chairman of the Provisional Municipal Council of this city, and all the councilors, including Du Yuesheng, suddenly submitted their resignations during the meeting the day before. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically asked Mayor Wu Tiecheng about this matter. According to Wu, the Provisional Municipal Council was established in mid-October of last year. At the beginning of the council's establishment, it was stated that the term would be one year. Calculating from the establishment of the council to the present, it will soon be a year. Therefore, the councilors have proposed a general resignation. However, according to the organizational regulations of the council, the term should last until the official establishment of the elected Municipal Council. Therefore, the municipal government has decided to request the Central Government to retain the Provisional Municipal Council. As for the use of the Reconstruction Public Bonds, they will all be distributed according to the original standards. The construction costs of the new buildings of the municipal government and various bureaus in the central district have not diverted the Reconstruction Public Bonds. As for the establishment of the Xingye Trust Company, it is for the purpose of providing loans to the people in the disaster areas after the war for construction. It is inconvenient for the municipal government to directly lend cash, so a trust company was established to handle this project.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Zhang Zhendong Discussed the Recovery of Acheng and Wuzhu by the China National Salvation Army of Eastern Jilin <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, Li Yuguang, the Chief of Staff of Zhang Zhichao, the Commander-in-Chief of the China National Salvation Army of Eastern Jilin, sent a special letter to its Shanghai representative, Zhang Zhendong, reporting the process of the recovery of Acheng and Wuzhu counties by the troops in Eastern Jilin. A reporter from the Far East News Agency met with Representative Zhang yesterday and was told the following:</p>
<p>Expansion of Military Expenditure: After investigation, our army originally had more than 80,000 soldiers, and 70,000 had complete equipment. Since the beginning of September, we have fought fiercely with the enemy in the Tonghe and Hulan areas. Our army suffered casualties of more than 20,000 before and after, and finally recovered the two cities of Tonghe and Hulan. After this battle, the enemy did not dare to easily provoke. Therefore, our army was able to rest and replenish, and expand its military strength. Although the equipment is not as sophisticated as the enemy's, it is still considered complete.</p>
<p>Three-Pronged Attack: After our army recovered Tonghe and Hulan and expanded its military expenditure, it divided into three routes to attack along the Songhua River. The northern route was Commander Wang Dequan (who recovered Tonghe and Hulan on September 1), along the north bank of the Songhua River. The central route was Commander-in-Chief Zhang Zhichao, along the south bank of the Songhua River. The eastern route was Commander Wang Zhenfang, along the Middle East Road. On September 5, the three routes simultaneously launched a general offensive.</p>
<p>Recovery of Acheng: Commander Wang Zhenfang of the eastern route personally led 25,000 elite soldiers from Hailin to attack Acheng. The battle was extremely fierce. Our army charged more than 20 times, and the enemy stubbornly defended without retreating. Commander Wang then divided his troops into two routes to surround the city. On one side, he recruited 500 daredevils to set up ladders to climb the city. They advanced wave after wave. The enemy's heart and courage were completely broken, and they abandoned the city and fled. They were intercepted by our army surrounding the city, killing more than a thousand enemies, capturing more than a thousand rifles, more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition, and four machine guns. The city was completely recovered by our army on the morning of the 7th.</p>
<p>Recapture of Wuzhu: After recovering Acheng, our army took advantage of the victory to attack Wuzhu, advancing day and night, and reaching the outskirts of Wuzhu on the 9th. The enemy heard that Acheng had fallen, and they were already cowardly. The troops sent to confront our army retreated as soon as they met, and the rear defense was completely empty. Therefore, Wuzhu was obtained without a fight on the night of September 11.</p>
<p>Preparing to Attack Harbin: After the recovery of Wuzhu, Commander-in-Chief Zhang ordered that the soldiers were exhausted and should temporarily stop advancing. We should wait until the central and northern routes meet and reach Wuzhu before attacking Harbin. After investigation, the distance between Wuzhu and Harbin is only more than 140 li. The enemy knows that after we get Wuzhu, we will inevitably take Harbin. Therefore, they have sent heavy troops to garrison. We also know that the enemy has concentrated heavy troops in Harbin. We should not rashly advance without sufficient strength and waste our strength. Therefore, we are currently staying in Wuzhu, waiting for an opportunity to advance.</p>
<p>Traitor Informant: Unexpectedly, something happened beyond expectations. When our army was rectifying its training to advance on Harbin, and at the same time when I was ordered to come south to ask for assistance, a traitor secretly informed the enemy's secret service in Harbin of our army's plan to attack Harbin and my news of coming to Shanghai. The Japanese enlarged my photo and posted it everywhere, saying that those who could capture me would be rewarded with 2,000 yuan in gold tickets. I have dedicated myself to the country, and I have long put my life aside. I originally wanted to report to all circles in Shanghai, so that I could get assistance and return to the defense as soon as possible. Now that I am not given this opportunity, I have no choice but to disregard everything, fulfill our soldiers' duty to defend the country, and fight to the end. Success or failure is not what we consider.</p>

<p>Can Be Completed in Mid-Next Month</p>
<p>All Built with Jinshan Stone</p>
<p>The four martyrs, Luo Yunxiang, Bao Zhengwu, Mao Zhengxiang, and Ying Wenda, members of the Boy Scout Corps of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, who were killed by the enemy while serving in the January 28th Shanghai War, besides the fact that the Corps, together with the Red Cross Society, the Boy Scout Council, the Boy Scout Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other institutions, were responsible for comforting their families, and Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Boy Scouts, awarded them the Silver Medal of Honor for Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage, the Corps also designed and raised funds to build a tomb for the four martyrs after they were killed and their bodies were destroyed by the enemy, leaving no trace of their remains. All the drawings were drawn by Yu Xueren, a member of the Corps and a famous architect. Zhang Yuquan, the manager of the Shanghai Cemetery, has also agreed to donate the land for the foundation. All the works are made of Suzhou Jinshan stone and are semi-obligatoryly contracted by Jinshan stone craftsmen. The total cost is 1,520 yuan. Since construction began in early last month, the project is expected to be completed on November 15 of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e109">World Anti-War Conference Abandoned Meeting in Shanghai <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Received Instructions from Paris Headquarters</p>
<p>Representatives Decided to Leave Shanghai This Week</p>
<p>The Shanghai newspaper "The North-China Daily News" reports that the foreign representatives of the Far East delegates of the World Anti-War Committee have decided to abandon the plan to convene an anti-war conference in Shanghai because the meeting place has not been approved by the local authorities. They will return to Europe in a few days. Yesterday, English representative Hamilton issued a statement on behalf of Lord Marley, explaining that this decision was made after receiving a reply from the Paris headquarters the day before. Ten days ago, after the Municipal Council refused to allow the conference to be held in the International Settlement, the Shanghai Branch Committee telegraphed the Paris headquarters, asking for instructions. The Paris headquarters replied the day before, listening to the discretion of the representatives in Shanghai. Therefore, the representatives in Shanghai immediately held a meeting with the Chinese members of the Shanghai Branch Committee and decided to stop convening the anti-war conference. Hamilton then told reporters that our travel expenses are all paid by the Paris headquarters, so we must obey its instructions. We all believe that staying here or trying to hold a meeting in other ports along the Pacific coast would be a waste of money and would not be helpful. Therefore, we will all leave Shanghai in the middle of next week or at the latest by the weekend. Lord Marley has decided to take the Trans-Siberian Railway to Pirobirjan to see the newly built German Jewish refugee settlement. Several other representatives may accompany Marley, because taking the Trans-Siberian Railway is similar in cost to taking the United States, but taking the Trans-Siberian Railway is shorter. If taking the Trans-Siberian Railway, they will take the Norwegian ship to Vladivostok and then transfer to the train, without passing through Manchuria, because they do not know if they are welcome to pass through there. On the way through Pirobirjan, only Lord Marley will stay for a few days to see the situation of the Jewish refugee settlement. These people are all fleeing from the Hitler regime in Germany and have fled to Poland in extreme distress, so they are being sent to Siberia for resettlement. The representatives now hope to hold a final meeting in Paris after returning to Paris to prepare a report on their activities in the Far East. Although we were banned from holding a meeting in Shanghai, we are not disappointed. We have held many small meetings and contacted people from all walks of life. Lord Marley has received many letters of sympathy from Chinese and foreign people. I am always surprised when I look at my bag and see how many British, Dutch, Danish and other men and women have expressed great attention and sympathy to us. Lord Marley will now cancel his trip to Peiping and Nanjing. It is unlikely that he will plan to hold a larger anti-war conference in the Far East for the time being. The departure date of the representatives can probably be determined tomorrow. According to the report, the representatives arrived in Shanghai on August 18 on the French mail ship Andre Lebon. In addition to the two English representatives, Marley and Hamilton, there are also the French representatives Juduli Ai and Pu Bo, and the Belgian representative Dr. Madou.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Rajchman to Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Rajchman, the League of Nations Liaison Commissioner for Technical Cooperation in China, arrived in Shanghai from Italy on the Italian ship Conte Rosso in the middle of last month. He passed through Hong Kong the day before. According to the Italian ship company, the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai at around 12:00 this afternoon and dock at Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Then, he will take a small ferry across the river to land. Qin Fen, the Director of the Preparatory Office of the National Economic Council, and Guo Dehua, the Secretary, will both go to welcome him. Dr. Danba and Dr. Delacou are among those who are coming with Rajchman.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Request to Postpone Land Value Tax <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>And Revoke the Housing Lease Rules</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Approved That Both Were Unnecessary for Discussion</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Government promulgated the Temporary Regulations on Land Value Tax Rates and the Housing Lease Rules one after another, the citizens of this city, Yao Wenxun, etc., believed that the land value tax was currently unbearable, and that the Housing Lease Rules also had obstacles that were difficult to implement. They jointly submitted a document requesting the Executive Yuan and the Municipal Government to approve the postponement or revocation separately. The Shanghai Bar Association also believed that the lease rules violated the law and requested their abolition. The following instructions from the Executive Yuan have been received one after another:</p>
<p>Instruction 1: Yao Wenxun and others submitted a request to the effect that the land value tax levied in Shanghai is an unbearable burden for the owners, and requested the Municipal Government to postpone the handling of the matter. The request has been received. After investigation, the regulations on the temporary land value tax levied in the city were previously approved by this court and approved by the Legislative Yuan, which believed that it was not necessary to go through legislative procedures. The request to order the Shanghai Municipal Government to postpone the handling of the matter should not be discussed. Regarding the candidates for the land valuation committee, the Shanghai Municipal Government has been instructed to give additional consideration. As for the statement in the request that the house tax in the city should not continue to be shared by the landlords and tenants after the land value tax is levied, the Municipal Government has been instructed to consider the matter. Inform immediately. This instruction.</p>
<p>Instruction 2: Yao Wenxun and others submitted a request to the effect that the Shanghai Municipal Housing Lease Rules are difficult to implement and requested that they be revoked. The request has been received. After investigation, these rules were previously submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Government to the court for instructions. The Ministry of Internal Affairs was instructed to reply to the court, and the court added and amended them at its discretion, and ordered the Municipal Government to follow the amendments and promulgate them. Later, it was reported that the amendments had been followed and promulgated, and a request was made for review and record. The court then issued an instruction to approve the record. Also, the Shanghai Bar Association submitted a request to the effect that the rules were inconsistent with the provisions of the Civil Code, encroached on judicial powers, and requested that they be abolished. Previous request.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these rules are intended to regulate housing lease procedures in order to avoid disputes. After review, they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Civil Code. Although Article 13 of the rules, which refers to "reporting to the police district in charge and handling the matter in accordance with these rules," does not specify the handling method, its essence is to give the police district in charge the power to consider and handle the matter, or to persuade them to pay the rent or to move out of the house. These are all powers that the police district should have. If the persuasion fails, they should be ordered to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law, and there is no encroachment on judicial powers. However, since these rules are in their early stages of implementation, it is feared that there may be excesses in the execution of the rules, giving people a handle. The Shanghai Municipal Government has been instructed to transfer the instructions to handle the matter carefully, and the Bar Association has been instructed to inform them of the matter. The contents of the reports are roughly the same as the original report from the Shanghai Bar Association. The request should not be discussed. However, according to the claim that all districts are sending police to sell rent books to tenants door-to-door, if this is verified, it is inconsistent with Article 2, paragraph 2, and Articles 3 and 6 of the rules. Methods should be found to stop this as soon as possible to prevent people from speaking out. The Shanghai Municipal Government has been ordered to investigate and handle the matter. Inform immediately. This instruction.</p>
<p>Instruction 3: The Bar Association submitted a request stating that the Shanghai Municipal Housing Lease Rules are not legal. The request has been received. After investigation, the Shanghai Municipal Housing Lease Rules are intended to regulate housing lease procedures in order to avoid disputes. Article 1 of the rules includes the phrase "except where the law provides otherwise." The legal aspects have already been taken into consideration. Although Article 740 of the Civil Code states that "the guarantee debt includes the interest, liquidated damages, damages, and other burdens belonging to the principal debt, unless otherwise stipulated in the contract," the so-called inclusion of various items refers to cases where it is not otherwise stipulated in the contract. If the parties clearly stipulate the scope of the guarantee liability in the contract, it is not prohibited by law. The Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to clarify the guarantee standards of the lease contract and to ensure compliance, has stipulated in Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Shanghai Municipal Housing Lease Rules that the guarantee liability is limited to the guarantee of rent and is limited to two months. This is not inconsistent with the law. If the parties have already agreed in the contract to expand the scope of the guarantee liability, it should be handled in accordance with the contract and is not restricted by the rules. Article 12 of the rules states that "If the landlord takes back the house for his own use or changes the property rights and asks the tenant to move out, he should refund three months' rent." However, its essence is to protect the tenant, and it does not mean that the lease contract is naturally terminated once the ownership of the house is transferred. After review, it is also not inconsistent with the provisions of Article 425 of the Civil Code. Although Article 13 of the rules, which refers to reporting to the police district in charge and handling the matter in accordance with these rules, does not specify the handling method, its essence is to give the police district in charge the power to consider and handle the matter, or to persuade them to pay the rent or to move out of the house. These are all powers that the police district should have. What is the encroachment on the executive powers or the jurisdiction of the court? The contents of the original request are all misunderstandings. However, since these rules have not been implemented for long, it is feared that there may be excesses in the execution of the rules, giving people a handle. The Shanghai Municipal Government has been instructed to transfer the instructions to handle the matter carefully. Inform immediately. This instruction.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Labor Dispute at the Power Company <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union Hosted the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>Reporting on the Course of the Work Slowdown and Labor's Demands</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the Shanghai Electric Power Company's Yangshupu new plant previously dismissed three workers and refused to pay 5% of the retirement fund, which led to a work slowdown by over a thousand workers. Details were noted in previous reports. Yesterday at 2 PM, the Municipal General Labor Union specially hosted the city's press at the union's location on Fuyou Road to report on the cause of this work slowdown. Ni Wenfu, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Fourth District Water and Electricity Industry Labor Union, and others reported on the course of events. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Dismissing Workers: Regarding the Shanghai Electric Power Company's dismissal of three workers this time, it is said that the company claimed that one was due to illness, one due to laziness at work, and one due to sleeping in the machine room. The workers, however, believe that these reasons are not sufficient. The worker dismissed due to illness was indeed certified by the company's doctor and granted three days of sick leave by the company. However, because the illness did not heal, and they could not personally go to the</p>
<p>factory to extend the leave when it expired, their reason is insufficient. As for the worker dismissed for laziness at work, the company authorities only stated that they were lazy at work and did not announce the specific facts. The labor union also believes that the worker dismissed for sleeping in the machine room is a one-sided statement. In the electric machine room, the sound of the machines is deafening, and it is extremely dangerous. Who would dare to fall asleep? Furthermore, no one witnessed them sleeping, and the machine room foreman did not report it. All of this is the company's side of the story.</p>
<p>Labor's Current Hopes: The three workers have already been dismissed. The labor union also insists on demanding reinstatement. However, they demand that the company, in accordance with the regulations, issue 5% of the retirement fund by name. The regulation regarding this retirement fund was decided by the company when it was transferred from the company to the Bureau of Works and was approved by the company authorities. However, after the labor union dispatched representatives to petition twice, there were no results. According to the company's declaration, retirement funds will not be issued to any worker dismissed for fault, and it is said that retirement funds will also not be issued to any worker who voluntarily requests to retire. Then what kind of worker can enjoy this retirement fund? Furthermore, it contradicts the original regulations. The company authorities have no sufficient reason to explain this to the workers and claim that the company authorities have the right to modify all regulations. However, the company's modification of this regulation was never announced to the workers before this incident occurred. The purpose of this work slowdown is to fight for this original right.</p>
<p>Will Not Affect Society: The Shanghai Electric Power Company's entire workforce understands that the supply of electricity is greatly related to all the citizens of the city. Therefore, they have always endured the company's repeated oppression and will never allow a moment of anger to lead to a strike by the entire workforce, affecting the entire city. Therefore, currently, only the regular workers in the new plant are slowing down work, while the workers in the old plant and machine room have not joined. If the machine workers participate in the strike, the impact will inevitably affect the entire city. The labor union authorities are paying close attention to this and will not create a serious situation. However, they hope that the company will understand this point and that the press will uphold justice.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Three Predictions by Astronomer Ye Youqin <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Will Experience a Hurricane Tomorrow and the Day After</p>
<p>Astronomer Ye Youqin is proficient in celestial mathematics and has frequently published meteorological predictions over the years. This newspaper is happy to publish them. Here are three more predictions entrusted to us for publication for the research of astronomers:</p>
<p>Predicting Wind and Rain: The recent strong winds and rains in this port, as well as the West Indies Cuban cyclone, the Mexican hurricane, the Chengdu earthquake, the Japanese and Italian earthquakes, and the French strong winds and rains, are all related to the movement of celestial bodies. I also predicted them with friends, and they all came true. I now predict that Shanghai will experience another hurricane between October 2nd and 3rd of this year, with strong winds and rain, and that there will also be earthquakes in Europe and America. When the wind and rain occur, please verify it.</p>
<p>Predicting Meteor Showers: After the beginning of winter this year, it will coincide with the passage of meteors, which is the period of intersection with the Earth's orbit. At that time, countless small meteors will be emitted from between the 12th and 9th stars of the Leo constellation, all flowing southwest, called a meteor shower. This spectacle can be seen in the hours before dawn on November 16th, 1933. It is predicted that the weather will be clear that night, making it easy to watch. Sky watchers can broaden their horizons.</p>
<p>Predicting Solar Eclipse: On September 21st, 1941, that is, in the Western calendar, the summer calendar Xin Si year, the eighth month Ren Shen Shuo, is the date of the solar eclipse. China can see it in its entirety. However, the eclipse will be deepest in Wuchang. At noon, the day will be dark, and stars will be visible. The eclipse will not be a perfect hook in Shanghai, but large stars will be visible. At that time, there will be strange scenes to see.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Wang Hanmin Informs That the Jiangxi Bandits' Offense on Wu County Has Been Repelled <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The responsible person of the Huining Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai told visitors that the Jiangxi bandits had indeed attacked Wu County several times, but they were all repelled. The claim of being captured may be a result of rumors. During the conversation, they also showed a private letter recently sent to Liu Ziheng, a director of the association, by Wang Hanmin, the security commander of Tunxi, which stated, "The bandits have captured Kaihua, Zhejiang. I have concentrated the joint security brigade along the Ma Jinling Jiangwan line and supervised more than 10,000 members of the militia to defend key points. The bandits dare not attack and have fled to Baishaguan. I have also strengthened the defense of Wuyuan. According to a recent telegram from Liu, the magistrate of Wuyuan, the bandits have attacked several times but were all repelled and returned to Dexing. There is no danger in Huizhou. Now, due to the strict deployment in Huizhou, the bandits cannot enter, and the area is peaceful." From this, it can be seen that there is no chaos in Wuyuan.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Representatives of the Four Provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Relief and Development of the Northwest</p>
<p>Briefly Negotiating Before Going to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>Guo Weiping, a representative of the Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia Four Provinces Relief Association, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to him, since Zhu Shaoliang took charge of Gansu and Shao Lizi was transferred to Shaanxi, they have both paid attention to relief and caring for the people, so they have gained the support of the people and have a good relationship with military leaders. However, financial difficulties cannot be resolved without the central government's practical assistance. His mission in coming south this time is threefold: (1) Representing the provincial government to request that the central government allocate American cotton loans to complete the Longhai Railway and realize the Prime Minister's plan for national construction, which cannot be carried out otherwise. Not only will the suffering of the people in the Northwest not be alleviated, but also the national defense in the Northwest will be very dangerous. (2) Representing the Gansu Relief Affairs Association to urge the National Government Relief Committee to pay the overdue relief funds and to request the central government and Shanghai philanthropists to raise funds to relieve the current flood in Gansu. Since autumn, the Northwest provinces have been severely damaged by mountain floods and hail, especially Gansu, where more than 30 counties have been affected.

<h3 id="e116">Silk Market Plunges, Silk Factory Association Discusses Wage Reduction Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Eliminating Daily Wage of 42 Cents and All Promotions</p>
<p>Implementing Production-Based System After Approval from the Authorities</p>
<p>Recently, due to the market downturn and the plunge in the silk market, many silk factories in the city have closed since autumn. The Silk Factory Association held a general meeting of all members at 3 PM yesterday to discuss issues such as changing to a production-based system.</p>
<p>Attending Manufacturers: Present were Wang Xiaolai (represented by Wang Bomin), Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Shen Huachen, Chairman of the Association; Chu Xin Cheng Ruiting; Yuan Ji Yuanxing Cai Jisheng; Yi Changsheng Fang Fuchang; Xiangcheng Zhang Peishen; Guangyuan Mo Weiru; Yongheng Yuan Bingzhang; Yuan Dasheng Shi Han; Zhengda Zha Jianshi; Zhenxing Shen Dingsheng; Yufeng Liu Zilin; Meifeng Wang Shunan; Fuxing Sun Chuanfang; Baotai 1, 2, 3 Xu Peixiong; Yutai Zhang Chun Gu; Qianyuan Hu Juqing; Fengtai Sun Huachang; Xiexin Fuyuan Zu Jinrong; Ruifeng Yao Ziyun; Jiufeng Yu Gufang; Yichang 2, 3 (same as above); Xiefeng Sun Zhongheng; Yuanhe Chen Tingsong; Yuncheng Zhou Shuxiu; Taixin Zhu Zhu; Fuchang Li Hongsheng; Wuxing Cai Yicheng; Jiatai Zhang Chucai; Hongyu Yingji Zhou Liren; Hongyu Gu Zhen; Zhang Shao Sheng; Maofeng Hu Zeming.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Shen Huachen reported that of the silk factories in the city, 63 are currently operating, and 15 have already closed. The reason is that after the January 28th Incident, the price of silk was 650 taels of silver per unit (approximately 900 yuan), and the wage was 42 cents per worker. Now, the silk market has fallen to 700 yuan, and there is no way out, so it is difficult to maintain. As for the production system, it was originally scheduled to be implemented on September 1st, but it was not consistent in all factories, resulting in a strike. Regarding workers' wages, Sunday rewards, promotions, silkworms, etc., the Social Bureau mediated and temporarily set a three-month implementation period from July to the end of September, which has now expired. At that time, it was stipulated that the standard would be determined based on market conditions. The above cases should be decided by the general assembly.</p>
<p>Meeting Results: After discussion, (1) Regarding Sunday rewards, promotions, and silkworms, all will be eliminated from October due to poor market conditions. (2) Regarding the wage issue, it was decided to petition the Social Bureau to pay according to the price after the January 28th Incident (ie, 42 cents) (the petition will be drafted by the association). (3) Regarding the production system issue, the association will draft opinions and petition for approval to implement it.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Telegram Requesting Relief for the Suiyuan Flood <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Flooded Area Covers More Than 500 Square Miles</p>
<p>More Than 500 Villages and 15,000 Hectares of Farmland</p>
<p>The Renji Hall Charity Relief Association received a telegram from the Suiyuan Provincial Relief Affairs Committee yesterday stating: "To the provincial governments and charitable organizations of all provinces: Since the beginning of summer this year, Suiyuan has been experiencing continuous rain for more than 40 days. The Yellow River has overflowed, and mountain torrents have erupted, and the situation is critical and has reached its peak. In addition, the rainfall in Long and Ning provinces is even greater, converging to the east, resulting in western Suiyuan becoming a vast swamp. All the counties along the river in Suiyuan, including Linhe, Wuyuan, Dongsheng, Laqi, and Tuoketuo, are submerged in water. Farmlands are washed away, and people are displaced. Having just escaped the drought in the past, they are now suffering from floods. Sheltering is a problem for those in dire straits, and life is plunged into despair. What did the people of Suiyuan do to suffer such a huge flood? The association has repeatedly sent appropriate personnel to conduct surveys, and the flooded area covers more than 500 square miles, with more than 500 villages of all sizes and more than 15,000 hectares of farmland. There are more than 200,000 victims. The magnitude of this flood is unprecedented in history. Currently, the victims in various counties are gathered together, sleeping in the open, which is heartbreaking. Enduring hunger and cold is unbearable to witness. In addition, it is autumn in the border region, and the victims have no place to live or eat. Although the province has prepared emergency relief, the disaster area is vast, and a drop in the bucket is difficult to provide immediate relief. It is necessary to call for help. In addition to the Suiyuan Provincial Government's telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee to allocate funds for relief, we have always known that you are kind and compassionate and care about the hungry and drowning. We are especially representing the victims to express their words. Please be kind enough to advocate and provide strong rescue. If you bestow generosity and promptly spread your kindness, donate money and clothing, so that the victims can be saved from water and fire and will not all become starving corpses and die in ditches. As we send this telegram, we are extremely anxious. Yuan Qingzeng, Chairman of the Relief Affairs Committee of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, and members Feng, Guo Jiaji, Yan Su, etc., bow in entreaty."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Important News on Disaster Relief for the Typhoon Disaster in Chuansha County <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The coastal areas of Hengsha, Gaodunsha, Yuanyuan Sha, and the Fourth and Fifth Districts in Chuansha County suffered severe damage from two hurricanes on September 2nd and 18th. County Magistrate Li Leng and local figures Huang Renzhi, Zhang Bochush, and Lu Rongan initiated the organization of the Three Sands Flood Relief Committee. Since its establishment, they have spared no effort in planning and carrying out their work. Currently, the personnel responsible for the various disaster areas are reporting the number of disaster victims, the number of households affected, the number of damaged farmlands, the number of disaster deaths, and the number of collapsed dikes and ponds, etc., in separate registers to the meeting. The meeting immediately appointed Committee Members Wang Changqing and Chen Junqing to be responsible for the re-survey of the coastal area of the Fourth District; Committee Members Tao Shaoru and Zhou Zhuping to be responsible for the re-survey of the coastal area of the Fifth District; and Committee Members Hua Shaobei and Huang Jinkui to be responsible for the re-survey of the various sand islands of the Sixth District. All departed on the 28th to go to the disaster areas to begin work. As for relief affairs, in addition to handling emergency relief on the spot, Du Yuesheng, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Yu Qiaqing, and other prominent figures from the sea have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Pudong Typhoon and Flood Relief Committee to raise funds on a large scale, and the relief funds will be supplied continuously, which is certainly not a problem. Two doctors, Pang Jingzhou and Wang Minchu, sent by the committee, arrived in Chuan from Nanhui on the evening of the 27th and planned to set up two rescue teams in Chuansha, one team stationed in the coastal Baihai Port Town of the Fifth District, and one team stationed in the Gaodun Sand Island of the Sixth District, to engage in rescuing the victims around October 1st. After inspecting the disaster area on the morning of the 28th, they took a long-distance bus back to Shanghai. The county's rescue of victims was originally undertaken by all the doctors of the temporary epidemic prevention station. Now that the temporary epidemic prevention station will end at the end of the month, it is said that the victims will benefit greatly from the takeover of this savior.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Yellow River Flood Relief Association Orders 100,000 Sets of Cotton Clothing <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Ordered From Two Clothing Companies</p>
<p>To Be Completed This Month and Transported to the Disaster Area</p>
<p>The Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee specially dispatched investigation directors to the three provinces of Lu, Yu, and Ji on the 26th of last month. It is now learned that they have all arrived and have begun to recruit skilled relief personnel and investigate the actual conditions of the disaster in various areas to distribute the relief funds. On the one hand, they are also preparing to set up shelters for the victims. As for the relief methods, they are divided into two types: clothing relief and grain relief. Regarding the cotton clothing issue, 100,000 sets have already been ordered from two clothing companies in this port, Huili and Baoda, worth 100,000 yuan. A deposit of 53,000 yuan has been paid, and they are scheduled to be completed this month and transported to the disaster area for distribution. The grain relief portion will be purchased locally because the price of clothing materials is cheaper in Shanghai than in the interior, while the price of food is cheaper in the interior than in Shanghai. It is heard that Xi Dejiong, the director of the group, will also go to the disaster area for inspection again in the middle of this month. Of the 1.5 million yuan of disaster relief funds allocated, a portion has already been received for use. However, it is not true that Cheng Jingsheng, the investigation director of Lu Province, has already departed. Currently, he is still staying in Suzhou due to an event, and Deputy Director Yin Jun is temporarily going to handle everything first.</p>

<p>More Than Fifty-Four Pounds Sterling</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Relief Federation for Northeastern Refugees previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward to overseas embassies and consulates to solicit donations from overseas Chinese. Yesterday, the association received a donation of more than fifty-four pounds sterling from the Cuban embassy, forwarded by Wang Zhengting. The original text is recorded as follows: "Respected Sirs, We previously received a letter and two donation registers (Nos. 1971-1972). The Cuban Havana Consulate General also received your association's donation register. Furthermore, the Cuban overseas Chinese are in dire economic straits, and it is feared that soliciting donations here will be of little effect. Therefore, the donation register was sent to overseas Chinese in Qianlida to solicit donations. The above information has been previously reported to your association by this consulate. Now we have received a letter from the overseas Chinese there, stating that they have donated 260.50 local gold coins and converted the funds into 54 pounds, 13 shillings, and 8 pence sterling to purchase a draft. We are sending back two donation registers and the original draft, signed. We hope you will verify and acknowledge receipt. After your association publishes the credit record, please also send a few copies to be forwarded to each donor. Sincerely, the Cuban Embassy to the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Relief Federation for Northeastern Refugees."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Changtai Relief Team Reports on Relief Efforts in Lu Province <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Southeast Headquarters of the World Red Swastika Society Shanghai Office received a letter from the Changtai Relief Team from Cao County, Lu Province, reporting on the handling of relief affairs, which stated: "Respected Sirs, The disaster in Cao County is concentrated in the northwest corner of the county. After consultation with Mr. He Xixiang, it was decided to have him and five team members start the investigation from the Second District. The area of ​​the district is vast, bordering the Third District, and the surrounding area is vast, about 500 miles, with more than 50,000 households and more than 100,000 people. The farmland has been completely submerged, the goods have been washed away by the waves, the ruined walls and collapsed walls fill the eyes, and the cries of hunger and cold vibrate in the ears. It is a rare sight in the world, truly a vast calamity. Mr. Xi and others, based on their duties, carefully investigated and issued relief tickets while investigating. After three days of running around, the general situation is in sight. Because the disaster in the Third District is more serious than in the Second District, it is planned to transfer to the district to select the most needy for investigation and release. As for the relief methods, there is a complete plan for discussion, distinguishing the severity and listing three grades, limited to 3,000 households, with 10,000 yuan as the standard. Once the relief tickets are collected, the issue of distribution will be calculated comprehensively, so that several thousand can be evenly distributed to Dingtao. The relief funds carried were originally agreed by the Jinan branch of the Shanghai Bank to be transferred to Cao for withdrawal. However, the financial resources here are exhausted, and the exchange is not smooth. As a last resort, Mr. Xi Dinghui and Mr. Jiang Baoyuan folded back to Jinan to carry the cash on the day of the number. They repeatedly traveled to Cao, wading through long distances and wasting time, and the poverty of the disaster area can be seen in general. Previously, it was agreed to make a report every five days. Due to the above reasons, it is difficult to report as it is investigated. We can only wait until the results are available before submitting a general report."</p>
<h3 id="e124">Industrial Zone Planning Completed in the City <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Awaiting Approval From the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Regarding the regulations for the city's industrial zone, a Central News Agency reporter specially inquired with Mr. Wu Huanru, the second section chief of the Social Bureau. According to him, the design of the industrial zone has been completed and is awaiting approval from the municipal government. Roughly speaking, the city's area can be divided into three: (1) Industrial Zone: The area north of Zhabei Baoshan Road is designated as an industrial zone. The Pudong coast can accommodate approximately 1,000 factories, and the Yunzaobang coast can accommodate approximately 500 to 1,000 factories. (2) Absolute Non-Industrial Zone: In this area, no factories can be established under any circumstances, such as the city center commercial area and cultural area. (3) Certain Areas: Although not industrial zones, smaller factories with no more than 30 workers can be established, provided that there is no noise that disturbs the residents' tranquility and that there are no facilities that affect hygiene. As for the government, it should consider the overall municipal plan and laws and regulations, and at the same time, it should also take into account the interests of the industrial sector. Therefore, factories that have been established with a record and do not cause a major impact on the health of the citizens should not be absolutely prohibited. However, in the future, the establishment of factories in the urban area must be approved by the municipal government and the Social Bureau before they can be started.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Postal Fee Dispute in Honolulu Resolved <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Served as Mediator</p>
<p>Two Measures Formulated by Both Parties</p>
<p>Post offices in various parts of our country often impose penalties on parcels and letters sent by the Honolulu Chinese Mail Bureau. In severe cases, the fine is several cents per letter. The various Chinese Mail Bureaus have suffered significant losses, leading to disputes. According to news from the post office, the penalties imposed by domestic post offices on letters sent by the Honolulu Chinese Mail Bureau are based on the regulations of the Universal Postal Union. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce there dispatched Du Huisheng, the chairman of the Business Development Committee, to mediate, and two solutions have been drafted: (A) In the future, regardless of the amount of remittance, a round-trip postage fee of one yuan will be added per letter. (B) In addition to calculating the exchange rate according to the bank's current price, a fee of 1.25 yuan will be charged for every 100 yuan remitted, and a fee of 2 yuan will be charged for every 1,000 yuan remitted. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has sent the measures to all Chinese Mail Bureaus for compliance to avoid disputes. Therefore, the postal fee dispute on the island can be considered resolved.</p>

As a humble and insignificant monk, I offer a small contribution and send eight yuan, merely as a strand of fur in a coat or a grain of sand in a pagoda. How dare I call it relief? I hope you will accept it and kindly send a receipt. With sincere wishes for your smooth progress and the spread of blessings, respectfully, Rui Wu from the Ancient Buddha Temple in Yichang."</p>

<p>New Dockyard Construction Has Also Begun</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Navy considers that the three-ton boiler products of the Shanghai Steel Plant under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Military Affairs, which has now been rebuilt, are quite suitable for casting steel parts. Yesterday, a reporter from the Japanese News Agency learned at the Jiangnan Shipyard that the shipyard had received a clear order from the Ministry of the Navy that if steel furnace products are needed in the future, they should be purchased from the plant as much as possible to protect national interests. As for the quality and value, it is necessary to investigate and clarify them and prepare a comparison table of Chinese and foreign steel grades before submitting it to the ministry for review. It was also reported that the construction of the large dockyard at the shipyard had been suspended due to a lack of funds. Now that the funds have been received, more than a hundred workers have been dispatched to begin digging at the dockyard model site, and it is expected to be completed by the middle of February next year.</p>

<h3 id="e130">A Kidnapping Case Was Cracked at the 16th Pier Wharf, the Mother of Three Children Was Overjoyed <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Kidnappers Are Heinous and Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>At around 1:00 AM yesterday, when the night was still dark, Chen A'gen from Wuxi, accompanied by two women, Hu Wangshi and Fang Qinshi, brought four children, both boys and girls, to the No. 7 Wharf of the 16th Pier in the South City. Just as they were about to board the Sanjiang steamboat berthed at the wharf, they were spotted by police officer Jin Peilan, who found their behavior suspicious. He immediately stepped forward and ordered them to stop and questioned their identities. Chen and others were evasive in their answers, so all three adults and three children were taken to the police station for preliminary interrogation by District Chief Guan Gong. According to the slightly older boy among the children, his name was Li Zhangsheng, he was six years old, his father's name was Li Qikang, and he lived at 21 Changle Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. He claimed that he was lured away by the man (referring to Chen) while playing at the entrance of his home a few days ago. Another boy said his name was Wang Heqing, he was eight years old, but his words were unclear. The remaining girl said her name was Chen A'jie, she was four years old, and she could not speak clearly. When Chen A'gen was questioned, he confessed that he was 29 years old, lived in Xiaoximen, and was a former tailor. The two boys, Li and Wang, were kidnapped by him from Changle Lane, Hengfeng Road on the 27th of last month. At first, they were hidden in Room 8 of the Gongli Hotel on Sima Road. As for the girl Chen A'jie, she was kidnapped from Datong Road on the 24th of last month and handed over to Fang Qinshi, a woman from Wenzhou whom he knew, who took her to live at the home of his fellow townsman, Ding Rongqing, at 5 Huacheng Lane, Xiaoximen, for many days. Only today did he bring Chen A'jie back and take her along with Wang and Li to this place by car, intending to board the Sanjiang steamboat and take them to Wenzhou to sell them. However, to avoid suspicion along the way, he asked Fang Qinshi and Hu Wangshi to each carry one child. He also confessed that in May of last year, he and his accomplice Bao A'sheng had kidnapped a boy on Gonghe Road and taken him to Fujian to sell, earning 180 yuan, which they divided and spent. Then, in October, they kidnapped another boy in Gongyi Lane and also took him to Fujian, selling him for 200 yuan. When Fang Qinshi was questioned, she confessed that she was 30 years old, had recently come to Shanghai from her hometown, and was staying at the home of her fellow townsman, Ding Rongqing. Chen had asked her to take care of the girl a few days ago, and today he ordered her to take A'jie to Wenzhou to sell. When Hu Wangshi was questioned, she confessed that she was 42 years old, from Wuxi. She had met Chen A'gen when he was a member of the Wenzhou Security Corps. Recently, she had come to Shanghai from her hometown with the intention of working as a servant. She met A'gen at the station, and he immediately asked her to carry a child to Wenzhou today and promised to pay her 20 yuan after the deal was done. She did not know that the child had been kidnapped by him, so she agreed. This was all her momentary confusion, which led to her being fooled. The police immediately went to Changle Lane to summon Li Wangshi, Li's mother, and after searching in the nearby area, they found Wang Liu'shi, Wang's mother, and Chen Fangshi, A'jie's mother, who were extremely anxious because they could not find their children. Upon hearing this news, they were overjoyed. They followed the police to the district, where the district chief questioned them again. Li Wangshi identified Li Zhangsheng as her biological son. Wang Liu'shi confessed that she was 29 years old, from Shaoxing, and lived at 27 Changle Lane. Wang Hesheng was her son, and he disappeared at the same time as Li. Chen Fangshi confessed that she was 34 years old and A'jie was her daughter. She lived at 17 Yongxiang Lane, Datong Road. Since the three children had been identified and claimed by their families, and Chen A'gen and others dared to kidnap three children with the intention of selling them, which was extremely illegal, the police were dispatched to Huacheng Lane, Xiaoximen, to arrest Ding Rongqing, who had harbored Chen A'jie. Then, at around 3:00 PM, they were all sent to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Lu Shengwu, a native of Huzhou, works as a clerk in a silk factory. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he became acquainted with a woman named Yang Fengzhen and lived with her in Zhabei, seemingly as husband and wife. Unexpectedly, three years ago, Lu became acquainted with Liu Jinmei, a young married woman from Wuxi who lived at 43 Junhe Lane, Kaifeng Road. He enjoyed the blessings of having two women. Over time, the two women suddenly became jealous. After mediation, the three parties agreed that Lu would spend one night at each place, so that everyone could have a fair share. Last month, when Lu was staying at Yang Fengzhen's place, he suddenly fell ill and stayed at her house to recuperate. Liu Jinmei believed that she had been occupied by Yang, so she and her mother and two or three female friends launched an attack, marching straight to Yang's house. A fierce fight broke out, with things scattered everywhere and furniture flying around. Yang was also beaten. The police arrested the people involved and imposed fines. Afterwards, Yang hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Liu for assault because Liu lived in the concession, while Liu also hired a lawyer to defend herself and filed a counterclaim against Yang. The other day, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court opened a hearing to question them. Lu Shengwu, as the fuse of the dispute between the two women, was also the object of their争夺. Since he could tie the knot, he should untie it. Therefore, the court specially summoned him to question him one by one and ordered Lu to go out and mediate a settlement. The case was adjourned for another hearing.</p>

Li believed that Hu was asking for a bribe, so he held a grudge. At around 10:00 AM the other day, when Hu was patrolling the vegetable market, Li saw Hu approaching and immediately took out a bag of lime and threw it at his face from the side, injuring his left eye.

<h3 id="e138">Shanghai Bank Organizes Rural Economic Adjustment Agency <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Farmers' Cooperative Lending and Cooperative Marketing</p>
<p>Trial Run This Year, Official Establishment Next Year</p>
<p>In recent years, our country's rural economy has been declining day by day, almost collapsing. In addition, the invasion of foreign goods has eliminated almost all rural handicraft products. Farmers are all struggling under the pressure of foreign economic labor. The banking community in this city is seeking to implement economic relief in rural areas. The Shanghai Bank has already taken practical steps this year, establishing farmers' cooperative lending and agricultural product marketing cooperation. Since it was established on January 1st of this year, it has achieved good results. The bank has designated this year as a trial period, and will officially operate from January 1st next year. A reporter from the East China News Agency inquired with the bank authorities yesterday, and the information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Farmers' Cooperative Lending In the agricultural areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, and other provinces, due to the invasion of foreign goods, economic decline, and stagnation of agricultural sales, the Shanghai Bank, after sending personnel to various provinces for investigation last year, prepared for farmers' cooperative lending, specializing in lending to legitimate farmers. After receiving the loan, each farmer used the loan to purchase seeds for agricultural crops, and then returned the proceeds from the sale of the harvested agricultural products to the Shanghai Bank. This lending method has been implemented by the Shanghai Bank since January 1st of this year. However, because the bank operates with great caution and has strict restrictions on farmers borrowing loans, the areas where loans are issued have not yet been widespread.</p>
<p>Farmers' Marketing Cooperation In addition, the bank also has a farmers' marketing cooperation method, such as in areas with overproduction or agricultural areas invaded by foreign goods, where local farmers cannot sell their products. They are handed over to the marketing cooperatives established by the Shanghai Bank in the countryside, which are distributed to various places or Shanghai. The cooperative only takes a small amount of money after the products are sold and the money is obtained. This cooperative was also established this year.</p>
<p>Official Operation Next Spring This type of rural financial adjustment agency is indeed very needed in the countryside. This summer, Chen Guangfu, the president of the Shanghai Bank, visited various provinces and had a very good impression. He is now formally soliciting reports from all parties and asking experts to discuss and guide in detail. Regarding this type of rural lending and marketing issue, the bank will submit it to the shareholders' meeting at the end of this year. If approved, it will be officially implemented next year. It is still in the trial operation period, so the bank does not want to publicize it.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Niu Yongjian Plans to Establish a Fishermen's Education Center <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Located in Jinshanwei and Other Places</p>
<p>Officially Launched in January Next Year</p>
<p>Niu Yongjian, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, has established a public education center in Yutang in recent years, with remarkable achievements. This year, he was even more approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to allocate provincial funds to continue expanding it. Now, Mr. Niu is allocating his remaining efforts to pay attention to offshore and lake fisheries. The other day, he gathered fishery experts Hou Zhaohai, Wang Wentai, Chen Chunshou, Zhu Songjian, the director of the Songjiang County Education Bureau, and others, and took a car along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to inspect the coastal areas of Jinshanwei and Zhalin at the mouth of Hangzhou Bay. He also climbed Sheshan Mountain, overlooking the coast and lake terrain. Then, he took a steamboat and cruised through the mountains and lakes of Songjiang, Qingpu, and Wuxian, such as Dianshan Lake, Cheng Lake, and Mao Lake. He believes that the fishery industry is of great importance to national rights and people's livelihoods, and plans to first establish one or two fishermen's education centers to instill knowledge in fishermen, promote fishery cooperatives, and provide relief to fishing villages, gradually starting with the improvement of fisheries and the promotion of fishing grounds. Yesterday, Mr. Niu gathered public education experts Gao Jiantian and Yu Qingtang, as well as fishery experts Hou Zhaohai and Jin Zhiquan, in Shanghai to continue discussing the establishment of fishermen's education centers and other measures, and plans to send Ling Lingjiu, Yang Piji, and others to the Wuxi Provincial Education College to investigate the facilities of the public education center in preparation for officially launching the project in Jinshanwei and other places in January next year.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Municipal Health Facilities <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has recently established the Hunan Clinic in Penglai Road, Nanshi, which has already opened. The Wusong Model District Municipal Hospital is also in active planning. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hunan Clinic The Municipal Hunan Clinic officially opened on the 21st of last month. In recent days, those requesting treatment have been very crowded. All diagnosis, treatment, and medication are free of charge. Because the clinic is limited by funding, the obstetrics and epidemic disease departments have not been opened. Other departments have been opened. If those requesting treatment require a number, they still need to pay a registration fee.</p>
<p>Wusong Office There are offices and hospitals in the Wusong Model District, but the buildings are still under construction and will be completed in about a month. A temporary office has been temporarily established at Tongji Medical University. After the office building is established, the internal equipment will be more complete. Preparations are now being actively made, and it is expected that it can be officially opened for diagnosis this year.</p>
<p>Establish a Municipal Hospital The address of the Municipal Hospital has been determined to be close to the city center, and the hospital site has also been purchased. The reason why it has not been actively carried out is that the funding has not yet been secured, but the difficulty in finding suitable talents is also one of the main reasons. However, the establishment of the Municipal Hospital is a fixed plan, so the Municipal Health Bureau is still working to achieve this plan as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Shao Wenbin Died in a Flower Association <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>A Feud Was Formed with the Fugitive Wang Shilong</p>
<p>Wang Bought a Gun with Zhang Bingrong to Shoot and Kill</p>
<p>Shao Wenbin, also known as Ma Fu A'liu, who lived at No. 19 Zhilan Lane, Kaizi'er Road, in the French Concession and used to sing local opera, but is now engaged in the flower association business, was assassinated on Huageniao Road at around 8:00 PM on July 28th of this year. Jin Jiulin, the chief detective of the French Concession police, and others arrested Zhang Bingrong, a Ningbo native nicknamed Little Ningbo, who was involved in the case, and sent him to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The other day, Judge Xiong Huiping continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. According to the plaintiff, Shao Wenrong, the deceased's brother, he is 63 years old and a local. He used to be a tea servant on a ship. Shao Wenbin is my younger brother. The official asked if he knew when his brother was shot and killed. Shao replied that he was at home at the time and did not know about the shooting. Shao Guanlin, the deceased's son, said that he is 18 years old. Shao Wenbin was his father. He was brutally assassinated this time, and he requested justice. When Zhang Bingrong was questioned, he confessed that the fugitive Wang Shilong had a feud with the deceased over the flower association. Wang Shilong arranged for him, Chen Changgen, and the already killed Li Shigen to discuss the plan to kill Shao at the Yuebin Hotel. On the 28th, Chen Changgen gave him a handgun. They went to the entrance of the Great World, saw the deceased arrive from Xizang Road in a rickshaw, and followed him to the intersection of Huageniao Road and Limei Road. Chen Changgen fired the first shot, followed by him and Li Shigen, who shot Shao down to the ground. He and Chen Changgen fled westward, and Li Shigen fled eastward and was shot and killed by the police opposite the Nanjing Grand Theater. The court verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, awaiting another hearing on October 13th.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Geng Huatang, a Former Senior Military Officer and Kidnapper, Committed Suicide in Prison <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Tore Clothes into Ropes and Hanged Himself on the Iron Grille</p>
<p>The Suicide Note Stated That He Had No Property and Did Not Do Evil</p>
<p>In July of this year, the French police arrested kidnapper Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen, Liu Yimin, Fang Qingshan, Wu Shaoting, Geng Huatang, Li Yueshan, and suspects Yu Yuanzhou, Chang Jianxi, Bian Zengyan, Wang Shikong, and a woman, Zheng Chenshi, a total of twelve people, in Tianjin and transferred them to Shanghai. They also took Cao Ziqing and Li Youren, who had been sentenced to imprisonment and were involved in the same case as Zheng, from the prison in the Public Concession. It was found that they had kidnapped Huang Yuyi, the vice president of the Zhongnan Bank, Chen Yanghe, the vice manager of the Siming Bank, Gu Zizhen's son Zelin, the owner of the Xinmiao Construction Factory He Shaoting, the paint merchant Dian Baohua, and others in Shanghai, and strangled their accomplice Little Shaoxing. They had also kidnapped Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, the compradores of Jardine Matheson, in Tianjin, tearing up the ransom notes, burying the bodies, and destroying the evidence. They were sent to the Second Special District District Court for public prosecution in accordance with the Law for the Punishment of Bandits. At the trial on the 6th of last month, in addition to releasing Yu, Chang, Bian, Wang, and Chen, five suspects who were not involved in the case, after the police did not prosecute them, Zheng, Shang, Liu, Fang, Wu, Li, Cao, and Li, eight people, all confessed to participating in the above-mentioned kidnappings. Geng was found to be related to the case in which the police seized the kidnapped victim surnamed Liu at No. 755 Haige Road on August 13th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, according to the confession of the arrested criminal Li A'er. He was ordered to be detained awaiting a scheduled retrial. Geng Huatang, one of the criminals in this case, was detained in the detention center of the Dazimingzhong police station. Unexpectedly, because he was afraid of punishment, he committed suicide the other night in the detention center while the other prisoners in the same cell were asleep. He took off his clothes, tore them into strips, made ropes, and hanged himself on the iron grille. When the warden of the detention center discovered it the next morning, it was too late to save him. He had already died and his body was as cold as ice. He immediately reported it to the police chief, who sent detectives to transport the body to the auxiliary Yuan branch of the Tongren Hall to verify the body. Before his death, the deceased had written a few sentences of a suicide note on the two lapels of his white spun silk shirt with a pencil, stating that he had no property in his life, did not do evil, and requested justice. He signed his name and said he had a wife who currently lived in Xiaguan, Nanjing, and requested that his body be handed over to the World Red Swastika Society for burial. According to one account, because the case was important, the police reported it to the Second Special District Court on the same day and requested the prosecutor to come to the police station with a forensic doctor to examine the body. The body was ordered to be handed over to the Tongren Auxiliary Yuan Hall for photographing and burial. Geng was 52 years old this year and was from Jinan, Shandong. He had served in the division headquarters and as a staff adjutant under He Fenglin when He was the Songhu Military Governor. He left his post when Qi Xieyuan fought in the Jiazi year.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Minhang New Ferry Completed <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Sailing from Both Ends, Can Load Ten Cars</p>
<p>Scheduled for Official Launch on the 4th of This Month</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway opened to traffic last October, the direct passage of vehicles has greatly facilitated transportation between Shanghai and Hangzhou. Every weekend and holiday, vehicles travel to and fro like shuttles. The Pujiang River crossing has become overwhelmed. However, the capacity of the existing ferries is too small, often causing vehicles on both sides of the river to wait in long lines, wasting time, which is regrettable. The Minhang river surface is vast, with frequent boat traffic, making bridge construction very costly. When the service was initiated last year, it was constrained by funding, preventing the construction of a larger ferry as originally planned. Therefore, the current vehicle congestion was anticipated from the outset. The Five Provinces and Cities Transportation Committee, recognizing the urgent need, proposed in January of this year, by former committee member Tan Boying, to build a larger ferry capable of sailing from both ends. Detailed plans and specifications for the ferry and dock facilities were submitted and approved, and entrusted to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction for implementation. In March, a bidding process was held at the Zhenjiang Construction Department. The hull construction was awarded to the He Xing Machinery Manufacturing Factory, and the engine was ordered from the German company Siemens China Co.. The Jiangsu Construction Department then requested Committee Member Tan Boying to supervise the construction. A summary of its construction is described below: The ship is 90 feet long, 23 feet wide, with a draft of 4.5 feet, a speed of 8 nautical miles, sails from both ends without needing to turn around, has a diesel engine with 125 horsepower, a load capacity of 35 tons, and can load ten cars at a time, regardless of the length or height of the vehicles. Each crossing is estimated to take four minutes, and it can transport 150 cars per hour. It is understood that the vessel has been completed, named “Jihang.” Last Saturday (September 30th), Wu, a section chief from the Jiangsu Construction Department, Zhang Yujun, Xu An from the Five Provinces and Cities Transportation Committee, and the original planner Tan Boying, formally conducted sea trials. The speed reached 9 nautical miles per hour, exceeding the contractual requirement. Trials were also conducted at the Minhang dock, with each crossing taking only two and a half minutes, enabling the new Minhang ferry, Jihang, to transport over 200 cars per hour. To accommodate the needs of the Haining tide-watching season, the authorities have scheduled the official launch for the 4th of this month. No fees will be charged for cars and passengers on that day.</p>

<p>Then Touring to India and Egypt</p>
<p>The world-renowned German Haijingbo Grand Circus Troupe, on its first tour to the Far East, chartered a special ship to transport over 200 rare birds and animals, and over 200 circus performers. They first performed in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya, Japan, for six months, receiving enthusiastic welcomes. Now, the entire troupe is about to perform in Shanghai, leaving Japan on the original ship, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of Wednesday (the 4th of this month). Last night at 8 o'clock, the troupe owner Haijingbo and executives, specially hosted a banquet for the Chinese and foreign press at the Cathay Hotel. During the banquet, troupe owner Haijingbo stated, in brief, that this is the first time our troupe has performed in the Far East. We will soon meet with the people of Shanghai, and then tour to India, Egypt, and other places before returning home. Our troupe has toured Europe and America many times and has been highly praised by people of all countries. The troupe has 22 tigers and 13 lions, which are exceptionally well-trained. The various skills will be unprecedented for the people of the Far East. We sincerely hope that the gentlemen of the press will provide guidance or correct any errors, and we will strive to improve. We plan to visit you at your newspaper offices with the trainers the day after the troupe arrives in Shanghai. We hope for your kind acceptance and are most delighted. Among the more than 200 performers in the troupe, there are people of various nationalities, but no citizens of your esteemed country are serving. We sincerely hope to find ambitious people in Shanghai to cooperate with us. The reason why our troupe came to Japan first is purely due to the sailing route, without any other intention. Our troupe has no political intentions whatsoever. The purpose is to earnestly connect the emotions of people from all countries. The banquet ended in a joyful atmosphere around 10 o'clock.</p>

In 1920, through the matchmaking of Yao Agen from Ningbo, she was betrothed to Xu Amei, 24 years old, from Dachan, who worked as a tailor. Xiaomei, who had not yet married, was close to Mao Xiuying, 16 years old, the adopted daughter of Mao Hu from Ningbo, who lived at 1189 Zhonghua Road. Recently, she worked at the Yufeng Sock Factory near Xiaoximen, leaving in the morning and returning in the evening, which was customary. Xiuying often looked down on her fiance, Mao Samsung, 19 years old, who was learning the shoemaking business, and often quarreled with Mao Hu. Later, Mao Xiuying and Wang Xiaomei, through the introduction of an ant-like matchmaker old woman, became acquainted with Zhang Guonian, 24 years old, from Yangzhou, and Zhang Zhongyuan, 19 years old, also from Yangzhou. The two men repeatedly went to the Yufeng Sock Factory to coax the girls out to open a hotel for a secret rendezvous. Mao Xiuying's grandmother, Mao Hu, followed them to the factory and discovered the two men sitting inside.</p>
<p>Acting Suspiciously - Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 27th of this month, the two girls, Mao Xiuying and Wang Xiaomei, colluded with each other and secretly ran away. Their families asked relatives and friends to search everywhere, but without any clues. Mao Xiuying and Zhang Guoxiang opened room number 5 at the Minhe Hotel in Tangjiawan in the French Concession, while Wang Xiaomei and Zhang Zhongyuan opened room number 1 at the same hotel.</p>
<p>Day and Night - The two pairs of lovebirds indulged in their pleasures, forgetting to return. Mao Hu firmly believed that Wang Liu's daughter, Wang Xiaomei, was suspected of colluding with her adopted daughter, Mao Xiuying, to run away, and repeatedly made things difficult for Wang Liu. The latter was already distressed because her daughter had also run away, and could not bear the burden. Therefore, Wang Liu waited for clues to the group along LinYin Road in Ximen all day long. By chance, at around 10 a.m. the day before, she caught sight of Zhang Zhongyuan and Zhang Guoxiang at the location. She immediately stepped forward and caught the two men and handed them over to police officer Zhang Fengtong at post number 24 in the Second District. She explained the situation to District Chief Li, who was pursuing the matter, and they were detained overnight. The day before yesterday, the two girls, Mao Xiuying and Wang Xiaomei, sensing something was wrong, turned themselves in to the Second District. District Officer Lin Qishan questioned the four men and women, and they all admitted to opening rooms for secret rendezvous without denying. It is said that after the interrogation by District Officer Lin, the case was deemed to involve adultery and abduction, and he ordered the six men and women, including the plaintiffs and defendants, to be sent to the General Bureau yesterday to be dealt with according to the law.</p>

<p>Suicide and Young Women by Zuo Yun</p>
<p>Suicide is the most passive method in life. People will never commit suicide unless they are in the most desperate and painful situation. Therefore, suicide in adults is mostly due to economic reasons; their future does not allow them to survive, so they resort to this last resort. Suicide is slightly different in young women, although it is mostly due to economic reasons; however, for a woman in her youth, her biggest economic concern is only the problem of living. There will never be the pressure of debts and burdens, so their suicide is a bit excessive.</p>
<p>There is another kind of psychology present in this: because young people's nature is excited and positive, once they encounter stimulation, it is as if a raging fire is sprayed with cold water, and it immediately goes out. They regard their future as a "Shu Road", thinking that it is impossible to pass no matter what. Especially women are often unwilling to struggle in the environment, preferring to die.</p>
<p>For example, the recent case of the woman Li Cheng who drowned herself in Zhanghuabang, and the disappearance of Ms. Wang Ren, both fully demonstrate the mentality of young women who are afraid of struggle: Li Cheng wrote in her suicide note: "...Effort? My head is dizzy and my eyes are blurred!... How painful and difficult is life? I can only send my useless body to the waves, end the suffering human world forever, and get rid of all troubles!..." Looking at Wang Ren's death note, it also says: "...How can I have the courage to fight the environment? Only sadness, discouragement, decadence, and厭世 (weariness of the world)... I feel that I can hardly find a bright road..." Although Li Cheng died by drowning and Wang Ren disappeared, their fear of survival is the same. They only know that survival is painful, but they do not know that human survival inherently requires struggle. Once a young woman leaves the dependent family life and begins to contact society, she often has a fear in her mind, so she is stabbed as soon as she touches society.</p>
<p>The same is true for many ignorant women. Recently, there was a young daughter-in-law named Wang from the same village, 18 years old, and a new daughter-in-law named Zhang, 19 years old; the former was from a well-off family, while the latter had a more difficult life. These two young women both committed suicide by swallowing opium. One had no reason, and the other was suspected of having an affair, but neither of them was forced to the point of suicide.</p>
<p>It can be seen that women around the age of 20 are particularly sensitive in their feelings. At this time, their comprehension and judgment are extremely weak, and they cannot analyze the various events in the environment, so they are very prone to straying into the wrong path - suicide.</p>
<p>China's social and economic situation is getting worse day by day, the number of unemployed people is increasing, and the starving are going crazy. If this continues, the suicide rate of cowardly young women will gradually increase. This future is very worrying, and this issue is very serious.</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Female Preacher, Chen Liang <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Morning, about ten o'clock.</p>
<p>In the third-class carriage of the No. 2 tram from Jing'an Temple to the Shiliupu dock, some passengers in less-than-tidy clothes were sparsely seated in various ways. Sitting leisurely, comfortably, without a feeling of worry.</p>
<p>But, there was no feeling of joy either, everything was an emotional void. When the tram stopped at Wangjiasha, a middle-aged woman came up, with her hair in a bun, wearing a short white cloth jacket, a black skirt, and white shoes and socks. An unadorned face, inlaid with a pair of lively eyes, and a mouth somewhat larger than the average woman.</p>
<p>The silence was broken by her.</p>
<p>However, everyone already understood in their hearts, "She is a female preacher." She swept the carriage with her keen eyes, then distributed a stack of pamphlets from behind, and said with pursed lips.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you should all know, right? Jesus is God."</p>
<p>However, these words easily slipped past everyone's ears, as everyone was busy flipping through the pamphlets in their minds.</p>
<p>An illiterate man in xiangyun shirt and trousers was also turning the pamphlet upside down, trying to find a colorful, beautiful picture like the one on the cover.</p>
<p>The female preacher did not show any sign of disappointment and continued,</p>
<p>"As long as it is humanity, it is full of sin. There is a passage in this pamphlet that says - emperors, commoners, loyal ministers, filial sons, great villains, and treacherous people are all prisoners of sin. Only God is without sin. God is the savior of sinners - therefore, as long as you respect God and believe in God, God will bestow happiness upon you and forgive your sins."</p>
<p>"Happiness" pricked everyone's nerves like a sharp needle. "Sin" was like waving a bright, shiny axe in front of everyone.</p>
<p>"Hee!" The female preacher laughed, and everyone laughed.</p>
<p>But no one understood the reason for the laughter.</p>
<p>When the laughter subsided, silence once again filled the void. There was no feeling of worry.</p>
<p>But there was no feeling of joy either, everything was an emotional void. In their hearts, there was only the struggle between "sin" and "happiness."</p>
<h3 id="e156">A Woman's Scattered Strings <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Women - they would rather share a rickshaw with a companion and haggle over a copper coin on the roadside, yet they would go shopping at a large company wearing a pair of high heels that cost no less than twenty yuan. Perhaps this is why women are called mysterious!</p>
<p>A precious diamond is not as practical as a sewing needle; a modern woman is often not as beneficial to society as a female worker, because most modern women are parasites of society!</p>
<p>A modern woman arrives, her high heels clacking loudly, strutting proudly, as if everything on the street is not worth her glance; high heels! Here, I admire the greatness of your magic. You not only elevate a woman's body, but also elevate a woman's status, and even elevate a woman's worth. (Junsi)</p>
<p>One day, it was the end of the lunar month: her face was flushed, her back was hunched, she held a passbook, and as usual, she went to that agency to collect her payment. The blue-eyed, blonde foreigner had extremely sharp eyes. Seeing her abnormal attitude, he seemed to fully understand her situation. Looking at her swollen belly, he said with broken Chinese, and a cold laugh, "Now that you already have a man, why do you still come here to collect money?" Saying that, he crossed out the passbook with one stroke. She was met with this rebuff, and it was as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over her. Both ashamed and anxious, she wanted to argue with him, "I am suffering from bloating." But in the end, she did not have the courage, and finally silently, with tears streaming down her face, quietly returned home. From then on, she lived a desolate life, becoming a sinner under the old ethical code. Her lover, seeing that she was gradually becoming strapped for cash, also disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Her belly was big: but she was still a "lonely and helpless" widow!</p>
<h3 id="e157">Outside the Circle of "Human" Life, Hu Chenzhou <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>This place is outside the circle of "human" life. Here, five or six hundred thatched huts stand in two rows. Because of the density of the rows, the distance between them in the center is narrow, so narrow that two children cannot stand shoulder to shoulder. And because they are arranged irregularly, it is strangely winding. There is an entrance on each of the southwest and northeast sides - an entrance and exit. The air is very filthy, the place is very filthy, and the road is very filthy (the surroundings are full of animal excrement and plant waste.) Those thatched huts are strangely small, a seven- or eight-year-old child can enter without bending over.</p>
<p>Women live here - women who sell their own bodies. They are outside the circle of "human" life. They have no joy, nor do they have sorrow. They only have hunger, they only know hunger. It is because they know hunger that they mechanically put thick powder on their faces every day, draw their eyebrows thinly, and apply red to their lips... Regardless of winter or summer, they mechanically stand at the door every day, those thatched huts are like holding an exhibition, allowing everyone to visit and choose. The oldest among them are over forty years old, the youngest are fourteen or fifteen years old, and many have defects on their faces or incomplete limbs, such as pockmarked faces, one eye, lame feet... But they all have the sensitivity that all animals have, they use a kind of deceptive smile and ugly appearance to cover up their shortcomings. This place is a haven for all the laboring masses, especially rickshaw pullers. They do not emphasize "form," but only emphasize the full satisfaction of "sex." They spend two or three mao here to obtain temporary "sexual" satisfaction. But the exploitation of their ordinary lives and the torment of "sex" cause them to act recklessly in this opportunity for "liberation," as if seeking revenge. But they continue to "live" outside the circle of "human" life. Because, because they know hunger!</p>
<p>This place is outside the circle of "human" life.</p>
<p>Housewife's Knowledge</p>
<h3 id="e158">Several Worthwhile Waste Items to Save, Pei Yu <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Women, especially women who are housewives and mothers, can be divided into two categories: one category likes to store odds and ends at any time and place, and the other category discards odds and ends casually, regardless of whether they are inside or outside. Women who like to store odds and ends are most suitable for families with a large number of people and a wide variety of items; but they should have the habit of being neat and tidy, storing odds and ends in different categories, taking them out when needed, and putting them back when not needed; only in this way will the family not find odds and ends everywhere that seem to be discarded and saved at the same time.</p>
<p>Women who save or store odds and ends at any time are sure to get a certain amount of pleasure. For example, when something is bought from a store, the wrapping paper and rope are saved, and when something needs to be wrapped or tied at home, they can be taken out and used. Isn't it very convenient and handy? Some women who make their own clothes occasionally need to match a small piece of silk or cloth. If she is usually someone who likes to store odds and ends, she will definitely be able to find it at home, without having to go to the store to buy and match it temporarily. When it can be used, it is a time of victory and joy, but when she sorts and stores odds and ends in different categories, it is her time of trouble. Usually, there are times of victory and joy when there are times of trouble and difficulty; you must not stop the plan to save waste because you are afraid of trouble and dislike difficulty.</p>
<p>Women with small residences and many housework tasks may not be able to store odds and ends at will; because storing odds and ends takes a lot of time and space, and the more you store, the more times you take them out and put them in, and the more times you pick things out. The difficulty for many women who like to store odds and ends is that they do not know what should be saved and what can be discarded, and they cannot have considerable judgment on the nature of storing odds and ends. Their kitchens and bathrooms are filled or piled up with a steady stream of things such as medicine bottles and empty cans. They also have correct and sufficient reasons for keeping these things; because they know that some empty bottles and cans are useful, so they collect and keep empty bottles and cans together when they see them.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, collecting medicine bottles is foolish, because before using this kind of bottle, you must wash it repeatedly, otherwise it is dangerous. All kinds of empty bottles with screw-on metal lids are worth keeping. After washing them, they can be placed in the kitchen for other uses. If you like to travel or have picnics, this kind of bottle is even more useful; because it has a screw-on metal lid, the contents of the bottle will not leak even if there is vibration. Porcelain powder jars of all sizes with screw-on metal lids are also worth keeping. Large white porcelain jars are easy to label, indicating what is inside, and are very useful in the kitchen; for example, vanilla, seasonings, dried parsley, diced cheese, and other various foods can be placed in this kind of jar to keep them fresh. Glass cans with screw-on metal lids are even better, because you can see what is stored inside at a glance. If you have the opportunity to get large glass jars, such as those displayed on the counters in candy stores, you must not underestimate them. They are extremely useful in a labor-saving and money-saving economic kitchen, whether it is for storing salt, sugar, oil, or wine, as you wish, and can help housewives a lot.</p>
<p>Empty tin cans should also not be discarded; especially the large ones should be saved. Many things can be put in cans. Small ones such as paper clip cans can hold sewing parts such as thread balls and pin cushions; large tin cans can be used as makeshift bread bins and refrigerators. Rubber bands, ropes for tying things, intact wrapping paper bags, and other wrapping supplies should also not be discarded; but when collecting them, you should think in advance whether they will be useful in the future. If they are useful, they are worth collecting. Daily newspapers can also be collected and used to wrap items on weekdays, and can be used as kindling for stoves in winter. There is also one use that is very effective for hygiene, that is, putting a few layers of newspaper in the ash bin can wrap up garbage and coal ash and throw them into the trash can, so that dust will not fly.</p>

<h3 id="e174">5-2 Victory: Shanghai City Soccer Team Shows Promise with Big Win Over French Business School Team <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>First Half Ends in 1-1 Draw</p>
<p>City Team Dominates Second Half</p>
<p>The Shanghai City soccer team participating in the National Games is a collection of elite players with strong capabilities. To prepare for sweeping away the Hong Kong and Guangdong teams in the National Games, a friendly match was arranged with the formidable French Business School team, a strong team in this year's Shanghai foreign soccer league, yesterday afternoon at the China Baseball Field. The City team emerged victorious with a 5-2 win. With the French Business School boasting many talented players, the City team's victory demonstrates their strength. The ten thousand spectators were satisfied. Referee: Le Xiurong.</p>
<h3 id="e175">French Business School Starts Strong <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The City team attacked northward, with the French Business School team having the priority of kicking off. They immediately took the offensive, demonstrating their strength. The City team, yet to find their rhythm, suffered as a result. The area in front of their goal was filled with opponents. Li Ningjiang defended tirelessly, barely able to keep up. The French Business School's forward's triangle passing was exceptional. Although the City team occasionally advanced, they quickly retreated, with warning signs everywhere. Indeed, due to a moment of carelessness, French Business School's left winger, Greenblatt, received a pass from the center and scored, just twenty minutes into the game.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Veteran Sun锦顺 Shows His Skill <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The French Business School's offensive remained strong, especially with the help of Cole and Beausoleil on both wings. Favaque's crosses were excellent, and Walter's pass to the left almost resulted in another goal by Greenblatt. After this training, the City team gradually improved. Feng Yunyou replaced Li Ning, strengthening the defense. Jiang Shanjiang passed to Xu Yahui, who passed to Li Yichen. Li Zhengzhong kicked, but Fulu Shou received it and fell, a pity it didn't score. Zhong Yongsen passed to the center again, but without success. However, the City team's counter-attacks became increasingly fierce, all relying on long-range shots. At that moment, Sun Jinshun, standing 25 yards from the goal, saw the ball coming and, with a back-heel kick, sent it flying into the corner of the net with a resounding sound. It was a marvelous shot, a spectacle to behold. With one goal for each team, the score was tied.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Barrage of Attacks <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The City team's momentum surged immediately. Li Yichen led the entire team, frequently approaching the enemy's goal. Tu Kaiyuan once sent a good ball flying to the right wing, but no one was there to receive it. Wan Xianghua intercepted the ball, seizing the opportunity to pounce, but the goalkeeper saved it, resulting in a corner kick. Xu Yahui also advanced for a long-range shot, which narrowly missed. Li Yichen failed to head in Wan Xianghua's corner kick. Favaque's foul resulted in a penalty. Liang Shutang's 50-yard free kick was headed by Chen Jiaqiu, but missed. With a barrage of attacks, the City team's prowess was on full display. Unfortunately, just as they were gaining momentum, the whistle blew for half-time.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Three Quick Goals <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>At the start of the second half, the City team made significant changes. Sun Jinshun took over the center position, Chen Hongguang replaced Sun, and Luo Haiguang replaced Chen Jiaqiu. Yichen and Jiaqiu retreated to rest. Chen Zhenxiang replaced Xu Yahui, forming a new forward line. The French Business School also made minor adjustments, with right midfielder Walter Jr. taking over as center forward. The City team's revitalized line-up immediately shone. Within fifteen minutes, they scored three goals in quick succession. Two minutes into the second half, Chen Hongguang made a strong debut, scoring the first goal, leaving no time to react. The City team took the lead. Five minutes later, Luo Haiguang scored again, making it 3-1. Sun Jinshun received a pass from Zhong Yongsen and passed to Chen Hongguang, who scored again. Within fifteen minutes, the French Business School suffered a complete collapse.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Unexpected Goal <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Despite this setback, the French Business School did not change their approach and continued to press forward. Halfway through the second half, Greenblatt evaded Tu Kaiyuan, and Beausoleil received the ball and shot. Gu Shangxiang, acting as goalkeeper, managed to react, but before he could clear the ball, Jiang Shanjiang was about to dribble it out, but failed to get past Favaque, who rushed in from the right and scored, catching him off guard. The French Business School salvaged a goal. After this goal, the French Business School, eager to recover, sent the entire team forward, leaving their defense vulnerable. Wan Xianghua seized the opportunity to shoot from long range. Fulu Shou received the ball and let it slip through his hands, but Luo Haiguang picked it up and easily scored, an unexpected addition. The crowd roared. In the last fifteen minutes after the 5-2 score, the City team's five forwards were constantly in front of the goal, moving back and forth like weaving threads. Fulu Shou looked anxious and slipped as he tried to defend both sides, and laughter followed whenever the ball moved. It was fortunate for the French Business School that they didn't concede any more goals. The lineups for both teams were as follows:</p>

<p>Rising Star Appears in Junior Tennis</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang Loses Honorably</p>
<p>Doubles Final Postponed Due to Darkness</p>
<p>Qiu Jiang Duo Wins 2-1</p>
<p>Another semi-final of the Open Singles at the Grass Court Tennis Club, Qiu Feihai vs.</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang. They had previously played one set, with Qiu winning 8-6. Play was suspended due to darkness and was repeatedly delayed by weather. The match resumed yesterday at the French Business School. Qiu won 1-6, 6-0, 6-4, for a total of three to one, earning the right to compete in the final. On the 7th of this month, Qiu will compete with Wang Wenzheng for the Shanghai Championship. Yu's performance was greatly praised by the audience. His rapid progress is astonishing and he is truly a rising star in Chinese junior tennis, with unlimited prospects. In the doubles final, Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang played against Liang Deguang and Carlsen. The game was halted on the second set, when Qiu suffered from leg cramps, and couldn't be finished. The current score is Qiu and Jiang leading with 6-3, 2-6, 6-3. The fourth set was stopped at eight-all tie. The date for continuing the match has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Singles Semi-Final <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai Earns the Right to Compete in the Finals</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang Loses Honorably</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang Demonstrates Great Intelligence</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang, the 1930 Shanghai Grass Court Tennis B Group Singles Champion, has maintained his original condition without special progress over the past two years. At the beginning of this season, there was no improvement. Judging by his recent performance, he has made great achievements. In the past, he played against Qiu Feihai and had a 5-2 lead, but lost 8-6 to Qiu. After that, he won two games against Zheng Zhaojia. Although he lost 1-3 to Wang Wenzheng a few days ago, his performance has improved greatly. Yesterday he played against Qiu again. He gave it his all at the beginning and won 6-1 against Qiu Feihai, which is commendable. The loss was the end of his hard work. His actions are delicate and pure, and his mistakes have been reduced. The wins and losses of each ball and the number of exchanges are very high. The diagonal volley is steady and confident. Both his backhand and forehand are successful. He also has considerable skill at the net, but the position is slightly backward and should move forward one step. In general, Yu's method of hitting is extremely intelligent, and he is the most promising person in the junior tennis world. He only lacks physical strength, which affects the disadvantages of long-term operations. It is hoped that he will pay attention to physical training at ordinary times. Today next year, he will be a great tool.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Wins Three to One</p>
<p>Qiu's victory over Yu took great effort. He ran around trying to cope and was exhausted. This is because Yu's diagonal volley is not easy to break, so when Yu hits left and right, Qiu runs around and can only defend, without being able to counter-attack. However, whenever there is an opportunity, Qiu is often able to subdue the enemy and leave him with no room to use his skills. In the first set, Yu won 6-1, which was truly skillful, because he was comfortable and easy. Qiu could only admit defeat. In the second set, Qiu washed away his weak state and the situation suddenly changed. Yu struggled with great effort, losing all six games. In the third set, he struggled again in a tense situation and his performance became more and more wonderful. The audience applauded constantly. Yu took the lead with a score of 4-2, but Qiu counterattacked to win 6-4. Overall, Qiu won three to one and earned the right to compete in the finals. When the game was over, Qiu praised Yu's skills. Grass Court Tennis Club President Grimshaw and Secretary Dwightley also shook hands with Yu, expressing their admiration and encouragement. So even though little Yu lost, he lost honorably.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Doubles Final <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Qiu and Jiang Dominate Two to One</p>
<p>The Fourth Set Was Not Finished Due to Darkness</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Suffers Leg Cramps</p>
<p>After the intense singles match between Qiu and Yu, Qiu was exhausted. After a short rest, Qiu and Jiang Daozhang played against Liang Deguang and Carlsen in the doubles final. Unfortunately, in the first set, Qiu had the unfortunate event of leg cramps. Fortunately, after half an hour of massage and rest, he was able to continue fighting. However, time was short, and the game could not be finished as scheduled. As a result of the three sets, the championship was not determined. In the fourth set, Qiu and Jiang took the lead with a score of four to zero. It was assumed that it would not be difficult to win the set and decide the championship. However, Liang Deguang and Carlsen caught up and made it four to four. After that, each won with a serving round, confronting each other, from five to five to six to six, straight to eight to eight. It was difficult to resolve for a while, and it was getting late, so it had to be temporarily stopped and continued another day.</p>
<p>Intense Competition Interests</p>
<p>The skills of the four are remarkable. Even the aging Jiang Daozhang can make the most of his strengths and spare no effort. However, Carlsen's performance was less impressive. There are many net touches during the block, and there are many serving mistakes. In each round, Carl’s serving round often fails. Otherwise, the situation may change. However, the competitive situation is always tight, the more the game goes, the more intense it gets, and the interest also increases, so even though the north wind is strong and the cold air is pressing, the audience still stays and the interest is extremely strong.</p>
<p>The Fourth Set is Difficult to Decide</p>
<p>There was little contact in the first set. Liang and Ka had flaws in their cooperation from time to time. Qiu and Jiang won 6-3. In the second set, Qiu and Jiang led 2-1, but Qiu suddenly suffered from leg cramps. After half an hour of rest, he continued the game. Since Qiu did not stretch and run, Liang and Ka won 6-2. But in the third set, Qiu and Jiang won 6-3 again. Liang and Ka performed quite well. They didn't expect to lose at first, because there were too many suicides with net touches. In the fourth set, after Qiu and Jiang won with a score of four to zero, they failed to win the set. Liang and Ka cheered up and chased to four to four. Below, each will win by serving round, resulting in a stalemate. After seven to seven, Qiu lost his serving round. It was thought that the Liang's serving round could be won. However, Liang also missed, so it became eight to eight, and it ended because of the darkness.</p>

<p>If sports are popularized among the people, the health of the entire population will improve day by day. This will not only greatly strengthen the entire nation, but also enable each individual to work hard in production. Therefore, public sports is currently the most urgently needed issue in our country. However, our country has never had a special book on this topic, which has made implementation very difficult. The Qin Fen Bookstore at 392 Labor Father Road in the French Concession of Shanghai, in view of this, specially commissioned Wang Geng, director of physical education at the Jiangsu Provincial Educational College, to compile the book "Implementation Methods of Public Sports," which has now been published. Mr. Wang has abundant knowledge and experience in public sports and has been implementing it in the Wuxi experimental area for many years. Therefore, this book is a carefully crafted work.

<p>Over Five Hundred Party and Government Representatives and Members Attended</p>
<p>Elected Thirty-One Directors Including Tao Baichuan</p>
<p>Resolved to Use Domestic Goods and Implement Literacy Movement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Association held its third membership meeting at the West Gate Youth Propaganda Group yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, amending the articles of association and electing new directors. Representatives Yu Zhongbiao from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Chen Bai from the Municipal Bureau of Education supervised the election. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members: Including Tao Baichuan, Xu Zexiang, Chen Jicheng, Xu Xingchu, Wu Zhiqu, Zhang Zhonghuan, Liu Zirun, Ma Jiazhen, Chen Dongbai, Zhu Youhuan, Zhu Zhiwu, Wang Xuequan, Lu Zhongkui, Huang Zaoxiong, Fang Yingda, Liao Zhaojun, Xu Zhengji, Li Erbai, Tang Zengyang, Wang Keming, Cui Jianwu, Liao Songgao, Huang Daping, Zhang Dongmin, Hu Xingyao, Yang An, Jiang Wenbao and other members from schools such as Jingye, Pudong, Minli, Junyi, Fudan, Shibei, Guanghua, Tongyi, Jinan, Guoguang, Minguang, Binhai, Chengmei, Tongji, Guangxia, Zhengfeng, Chuangzhi, Xinlu, Xinhuan, Dongya, Jiangnan, Dagong, Private Shanghai High School, Shanghai Preschool Normal School, Shanghai Girls' High School, Ai Qun Girls' High School, Minli Girls' High School, Daozhong Girls' High School, Zhengxing Girls' High School, Huadong Girls' High School, Cihang Maternity, Huzhou Middle School, and Chengdong Girls' High School, totaling over five hundred people.</p>
<p>Meeting Details: The meeting began at 9:00 AM. The presidium consisted of Tao Baichuan, Chen Jicheng, Liao Zhaojun, Wu Zhiqian, and Zhu Youhuan. Wang Chao served as the master of ceremonies, and Xu Zexiang served as the recorder. Liu Zirun, Sheng Xugong, Wang Keming, Ma Zhongkai, and Wu Baojin served as receptionists. First, Chen Jicheng of the presidium reported on the purpose of the meeting, and Wu Zhiqian reported on the association's affairs. Then, representatives Yu Zhongbiao from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Chen Bai from the Municipal Bureau of Education gave speeches. Next, the articles of association were discussed, and new directors were re-elected. Finally, proposals were discussed, and a photo was taken before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: (1) Chen Jicheng of the presidium reported that there are over one hundred middle schools and two thousand teachers and staff in the city, but there has been very little communication in the past. In view of this, the members of this association, after the outbreak of the national crisis, organized the Middle School Teachers' Association. After two re-elections, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Bureau of Education have both filed records. However, due to the small number of members, there has not been much contribution. Recently, comrades in the education community of this city believe that it is necessary to expand the organization. Therefore, at today's general meeting, the number of new members has reached over eight hundred, which is the most pleasant thing for the members of this association. In the future, we will identify goals, work hard on association affairs, and jointly seek the development of this association and the welfare of the middle school education community. (2) Wu Zhiqian's report on association affairs was briefly divided into (1) the process of this re-election, (2) the total number of current new and old members, (3) the situation of previous standing committee meetings, and (4) an overview of various undertakings.</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches: Representative Yu Zhongbiao from the Municipal Party Headquarters gave a speech, stating that the purpose of the organization of the Middle School Teachers' Association is to unite wills and concentrate strength. The performance of past achievements and the sharp increase in the number of members today all prove its spirit of endeavor. However, during this period of national crisis, we should not forget the special mission of training young people to do national salvation work. Then, the Middle School Teachers' Association will become an organization for saving the nation and the people. In today's increasingly deteriorating international struggle, the Chinese nation is in danger of being dragged into the whirlpool and destroyed at any time. It is hoped that the education community will unite its will and concentrate its strength to shoulder the mission of saving the Chinese nation. Representative Chen Bai from the Municipal Bureau of Education gave a speech, stating that (1) the teaching policy should be suitable for the needs of students and provide convenience for their further education and employment. (2) Intensifying students' civic training is a matter that should be paid close attention to in the middle school education stage, so that they can be good citizens in society after leaving school. Finally, I hope that after today's grand meeting, the Middle School Teachers' Association will create the most solid foundation and become a model for youth activities.</p>
<p>Election of Directors: Thirty-one directors were elected, including Tao Baichuan, Chen Jicheng, Xu Zexiang, Lin Meiyan, Tao Guangchuan, Yuan Zhe, Yang Zhi, Zhu Youhuan, Wu Zhiqian, Sheng Xugong, Liu Xiuru, Huang Yan, Huang Zaoxiong, Hu Xingyao, Ma Jiazhen, Xu Zhengji, Gu Jiwu, Zhang Dongmin, Xu Zeyi, Yue Tai, Ma Xuerui, Qian Gongdu, Liu Zirun, Xu Xingchu, Zhang Jiafeng, Zhang Xinchang, Zhang Shilin, Lu Xirong, Ling Xianwen, Ding Hongfan, and Zhang Shuqin. Nine alternate directors were elected: Zhou Leshan, Wang Xuequan, Wang Yukai, Cheng Kuanzheng, Zhou Shang, Jiang Wenbao, Yan Junxuan, Jiang Hongqi, and Shi Naizhu.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: (1) Amending the articles of association, adding "This Association may organize special committees as needed by the facts" to Article 4, changing the term of office "half a year" to "one year," and changing the original text of Article 7, "The passage of a motion shall be valid with the vote of more than one-half of the number of attendees," to "The passage of a motion shall be valid with the vote of the majority of attendees."

(3) This association should cooperate with the Municipal Party Headquarters to go deep into the working class society and implement the literacy movement, which was resolved and passed. (4) This association should hold a lecture on Chinese economic issues, which was resolved and passed. After the discussion was over, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>(Communication from Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Principals' Association, concerning the illegal arrest and detention for more than ten days of Shen Zhensheng, the former principal of Rushi Normal School, by Zhao Jingyuan, the former magistrate of Rugao County (who has now been removed from office), the principal decided to send a letter of condolence at the meeting of all principals in Zhenjiang on the 15th of last month. Here is the original letter:</p>
<p>To Mr. Jueren, In June of this year, while you were serving as the principal of Rugao, you were illegally arrested by Zhao Jingyuan, the magistrate of the local county, and suffered injustice for no reason. We are all very indignant. We immediately convened a meeting to submit a request to the Provincial Government and the Department of Education to severely punish this illegal magistrate and must achieve the goal of dismissal, so as to warn those who abuse their authority. Letters and telegrams were exchanged frequently. Fortunately, the Provincial Department believed that the county magistrate was confused and hasty, and gave him a dismissal. Right and wrong has also been cleared up as a result. At that time, you resigned from your post to recuperate because you were too deeply stimulated. Although we have no right to retain you, we hope that you will not let a temporary setback damage your ambition to dedicate yourself to education. We would be very fortunate if you would not. In addition to asking Mr. Xu Jidun to express our condolences in person, we respectfully offer you this letter with our enthusiasm, hoping that you will consider it. (Omission) Sincerely, All members of the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Principals' Association, October 1, 1933.</p>

<p>— Zhao Yu Huang</p>
<p>A section from the Introduction of the New Book "Modern Materia Medica Pharmacognosy"</p>
<p>Japanese culture originated later than other countries. From ancient times, they have sincerely imitated China, with an attitude of accepting almost all Chinese culture. Medicine is one example. After Western culture entered Japan, Japan once again changed its attitude of accepting Chinese culture, turning to Westernization. Medical culture also shifted accordingly. Although Japan has no inherent national essence, it has a natural inclination to adopt what is good. This is a special characteristic of the people of the Japanese archipelago. Our country's medicine has a history of three or four thousand years, and we stand proudly as an advanced country. However, we have fallen behind Japan. This is due to excessively deep-rooted traditional concepts that stifle progress. Taking materia medica as an example, the dedication of Japanese materia medica scholars before the Meiji Restoration in studying our country's materia medica far surpassed that of medical scholars in China during the Kangxi, Qianlong, Jiaqing, Daoguang, Xianfeng, and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty (1736-1874 AD). Chinese materia medica, from the "Shen Nong's Classic of Materia Medica" revised by Tao Hongjing of the Liang Dynasty to Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" of the Ming Dynasty, passing through the prosperous Tang and Song dynasties, has lost many precious and secret books. Seeking them in Japan often yields results. This is clear evidence of Japan's emphasis on our country's medical literature. Looking at the records of materia medica scholars before the Meiji Restoration (1607-1867 AD) and then looking back at our country's medical books of the same era, there is a stark contrast. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" was transmitted to Japan around 1607 AD, the 35th year of Wanli in the Ming Dynasty, which is the 12th year of Keicho in Japan. It was obtained from Nagasaki (a place close to China) by Hayashi Doshun and presented to the shogunate. In 1672 (the 11th year of Kangxi, the 12th year of Kanbun), Kaibara Ekiken's corrected "Compendium of Materia Medica" in 39 volumes was published. In 1709 (the 48th year of Kangxi, the 6th year of Hoei), Ono Ranzan completed "Enlightenment of the Compendium of Materia Medica" in 48 volumes, a highly valuable work. Even today, scholars of Sino-Japanese materia medica in Japan must base their detailed research on this book. Other materia medica books worth noting include Ino Jakusui's "Collection of Common Things" in 1,000 volumes, completed in 1704 (the 43rd year of Kangxi, the 1st year of Kan'ei), a grand spectacle in the literary record; Shimada Mitsufusa's "Collection of Flowers" in 8 volumes, completed in 1765 (the 30th year of Qianlong, the 2nd year of Meiwa); and Zeng Pan's "Illustrated Treatise on Forms" in 100 volumes, completed in 1804 (the 9th year of Jiaqing, the 1st year of Kan'ei). All of these contributed to art and literature. In 1828 AD, during the 8th year of Daoguang in our country, the 11th year of Bunsei in Japan, Iwasaki Kanemasu, a great master of materia medica, devoted over 20 years of painstaking effort to complete the "Illustrated Materia Medica" in 90 volumes, collecting over 2,000 species of plants and trees. The illustrations are exquisite, with meticulous coloring, making it an outstanding work among Japanese materia medica books, far beyond what materia medica scholars in our country could have dreamed of 100 years ago. Our country's materia medica illustrations are crude and inaccurate, extremely laughable, and often ridiculed by Japanese scholars. The more accurate materia medica illustrations in our country are the "Famine Relief Materia Medica" of the Ming Dynasty and the "Illustrated Investigation of Plant Names and Realities" of the Qing Dynasty (published during the Daoguang period, 1821-1850 AD), which are above average. However, compared to the "Illustrated Materia Medica," they cannot compare. Furthermore, Iinuma Yokusai's "Illustrated Treatise on Plants and Trees" in 30 volumes (published from 1832, the 12th year of Daoguang, the 3rd year of Tempo, to 1856, the 6th year of Xianfeng, the 3rd year of Ansei) provides detailed explanations, verifiable names and realities, and can use scientific methods to describe the ecology of real objects. The "Illustrated Materia Medica" has been revised by Shirae Mitsutaro in later generations, and the "Illustrated Treatise on Plants and Trees" has been supplemented by Makino Tomitaro in modern times, making them a comprehensive and indispensable reference book for studying Sino-Japanese medicine in modern times.</p>
<p>(Postscript) In 1900 (the 11th year of Taisho), Japan republished and distributed the original manuscript of the "Illustrated Materia Medica." After the earthquake, the printing plates were destroyed. Those that were preserved are highly valued by scholars, and the number of copies imported into China is probably very limited. To my knowledge, the collection of the Commercial Press Library's Business Department was destroyed in the Shanghai Incident. One copy is in the collection of the Peking Union Medical College, one copy was in the collection of the former Shanghai Central Hygiene Experimental Institute, and one copy is in the author's collection.</p>
<p>Regarding the scientification of Japanese materia medica, it occurred around 1782 AD, the 47th year of Qianlong in our country, the 2nd year of Tenmei in Japan. Dutch medicine was first introduced to Japan, one year after the publication of "Ladder to Dutch Studies" (1783). A Swedish physician named Carl Peter Thunberg (1743-1828), a physician who was also a botanist, transmitted Linnaeus's learning to Japan. His students included Katsuragawa Hoshu and others. His writings include "Flora Japonica" (1784 edition), leaving a legacy for scholars in his country. Between 1750 and 1866, a German physician and botanical researcher named Siebold also came to Japan to study plants. Materia medica scholars such as Mizutani Sukeroku and Ito Keisuke personally studied with him. Sukeroku translated Linnaeus's "Species Plantarum" (i.e., Houttuyn's "Natuurlyke histotio…van Linnaeus" Deel IL Planta 14 Stuk 177-83) and applied it, determining the scientific names of plants. Thus, the study of materia medica gradually entered the realm of botany. In 1829 (the 9th year of Daoguang, the 12th year of Bunsei), Ito Keisuke, based on Siebold's learning, wrote "A Treatise on the Names of Western Materia Medica" in two volumes. From this, botany emerged from materia medica, and materia medica was based on botany. In 1833, during the 13th year of Daoguang in our country, the 4th year of Tempo in Japan, Udagawa Yoan completed "Introduction to Plant Studies" in three volumes and translated Weiumann's "Phyhytebthozaiconagraphia" (i.e., J. Burmann's "Taalryk Register der Plaatafte fignurn-oschryvingen derblcemdragende gewassen 1736-1748") from Dutch. This is the newly revised and supplemented "Dutch Medical Mirror" in 18 volumes of 1829. Thus, Japanese materia medica and botany were fused into one, resulting in botanical materia medica. The progress of materia medica was rapidly approaching the standards of Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Subsequently, from the Meiji Restoration onwards (i.e., after 1868), materia medica, further refined by the incorporation of various natural sciences, transformed into the distinctly established field of pharmacognosy. Japanese modern pharmacognosy has indirectly benefited from botanists such as Miyoshi Manabu, Matsumura Jinzo, Shirai Mitsutaro, Makino Tomitaro, and Professor Shibata Keitaro. Specialists in pharmacognosy or pharmaceutical chemistry within pharmaceutical sciences have directly made great contributions, such as the late Professor Shimosawa Junichiro, Nagai Nagayoshi, Tanba Keizo, Hirano Ikkaku, and modern masters of pharmacognosy and pharmaceutical chemistry, such as Professor Asahina Yasuhiko. Recently, scholars such as Karisawa Tatsuo, Fujita Naoto, and Nakao Manzo have conducted extensive research in pharmacognosy, providing valuable insights for national medicine. Our country's pharmacy is still in its infancy, and the entire nation seems to be dreaming, truly sighing with a sense of being unable to catch up. Mr. Nakao has also studied the origins of our country's materia medica throughout history, providing extremely detailed information. From the "Classic of Mountains and Seas," the "Book of Songs," the "Erya," historical materia medica classics, and even historical records, philosophical works, and miscellaneous writings related to materia medica, he has extensively cited and thoroughly explored them, compiling records. Standing on the position of modern pharmacognosy, he seems to be reviving our country's ancient materia medica from thousands of years ago. Japanese people regard him as a great master of Chinese materia medica, and he is not ashamed of it. Alas! Is Mr. Nakao's materia medica truly aimed at reviving our country's old materia medica? No, it is aimed at providing assistance for modern pharmacognosy research. As the saying goes, "Reviewing the old to learn the new can be a teacher." This is what Mr. Nakao is doing.</p>

<p>The pharmacy department of Utrecht University in the Netherlands has a long history. The university was founded in 1636. At that time, there were only departments of theology and law. Later, Mulder studied beer, Magnus studied drugs, Weut studied botany, and Cohon and Van Roumburgh studied organic chemistry. The pharmaceutical experiment laboratory and botanical garden for cultivating crude drugs were built in 1900, marking a prosperous period for pharmaceutical education in the Netherlands. The pharmacy department's curriculum includes pharmacognosy, dispensing, physiological chemistry, microbiology, analytical chemistry, toxicology, food chemistry, and pharmaceutical chemistry. Classes are held every morning, and practical exercises are conducted in the afternoon.</p>
<p>To obtain pharmacist qualifications in the Netherlands, one must pass the university examination. The preliminary examination also requires six years of advanced arts education and proficiency in Latin, or five years of advanced secondary school and proficiency in physics and chemistry. The university examination regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Candidate pharmacist examination (equivalent to a Bachelor of Science in the UK). The subjects are chemistry, physics, and botany (or zoology and mineralogy). The time required to study these subjects is three years.</p>
<p>(2) Degree examination (equivalent to a Master of Science in the UK). The subjects are pharmacy, including chemistry and pharmacognosy. One must also choose one from toxicology, microbiology, pharmacology, and physiological chemistry. The time required to study these subjects is two and a half years.</p>
<p>(3) Practical examination subjects: qualitative and quantitative analytical chemistry, toxicology testing, medicinal botany, dispensing, pharmacognosy, and microscopic testing.</p>
<p>Candidate pharmacists must practice under the guidance of a qualified pharmacist for at least one year. In addition, there is a pharmacy assistant examination, which is not part of the university examination and is not related to a pharmacy degree. Young students usually take this examination before entering university, or after passing the candidate pharmacist examination. However, students who wish to participate in this examination must first receive one year of pharmacy training. The requirements for entering pharmacy school in the UK are higher education and a graduation certificate. After passing the examinations of the education bureau and examination board, one can enter the school. There are 25 pharmacy schools in and around London. The education system includes full-time classes to prepare for formal qualifications and university degree examinations, and part-time classes - day or night classes - to study pre-pharmacy science. The full-time curriculum is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) One-year course (A): The level is equivalent to the first year of pharmacy school in the United States. Upon completion of the course, one is qualified to take the preliminary examination.</p>
<p>(2) One-year course (B): The level is equivalent to the second year of pharmacy school in the United States. Upon completion of the course, one is qualified to take the chemist and pharmacist examinations, but does not receive a degree.</p>
<p>(3) Two-year course: Upon completion of the course, one is qualified to take the pharmaceutical chemist examination, but does not receive a degree. However, the two-year course at the University of London's pharmacy department allows one to take the pharmaceutical chemist examination and obtain a Bachelor of Pharmacy (B. Pharm) degree.</p>
<p>(Upon graduation from the three-year course, one can obtain a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree. The three-year pharmacy course at the University of Glasgow and the four-year course at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in the United States both grant a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy.)</p>
<h3 id="e192">Preface to a Guide to Lung Disease <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Fubao</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis, formerly known as consumption, is commonly referred to as lung disease due to the large number of patients. The pathogen is the tubercle bacillus. After this bacterium invades the lungs, its nature is particularly tenacious. No matter what kind of oral or injectable medication is used, it cannot be eradicated. It relies solely on our body's natural defense mechanism, where white blood cells surround the tubercle bacillus and connective tissue forms a protective barrier around it, building a very strong line of defense. This prevents the bacteria from breaking out and cuts off its food supply. Even then, the bacteria can survive for two and a half years before dying. Therefore, given the tenacity of the tubercle bacillus, it is not enough to rely on drugs to eradicate the bacteria. Instead, one must rely on this natural, long-term defense mechanism. However, people do not know how to utilize this defense mechanism as a fundamental treatment method and seek long-term resistance. Instead, they want to rely on drugs to eradicate the bacteria. Therefore, patients often first take traditional Chinese medicine without effect, then switch to Western medicine without effect, and then take various special medicines advertised in newspapers without effect. Or they take various single remedies such as monkey bezoar, "dui kou jun," human placenta, etc., constantly changing remedies, trying hundreds of medicines randomly. Or they rush around, tiring themselves out on boats and cars. Or they consult fortune-tellers and seek answers from gods and ghosts. After a long time, all of these are ineffective. The patient, because they are working all day and refuse to rest, destroys the naturally formed defense line that surrounds the bacteria, leaving nothing behind. The bacteria have already spread around and expanded their territory. The disease worsens day by day, and the patient and their family are like being in a fog, lost in direction, like navigating the seas on a dark night without a compass, or like a blind person riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pond at night, with the danger of falling a thousand feet. They are not only wandering around, at a loss, but more.</p>
<p>People in our country have a vague and influential understanding of the treatment of lung disease and do not yet understand why. Therefore, the spread of infection is widening and has no end in sight. According to the latest survey by Dr. Suyoda in Japan, two million people in Japan have tuberculous symptoms such as fever, hemoptysis, fatigue, and cough every year, and 130,000 people die from tuberculosis every year. Our country's population is about seven times that of Japan. If we use Japan as a proportion, then 14 million people have tuberculous symptoms every year, and 910,000 people die from tuberculosis. The state of medical and health care in our country is far inferior to that of Japan, which is undeniable. Therefore, if our country had statistical tables to check, the number would certainly be more than this. However, even with this number, the medical expenses and lost income from work each year, if calculated at four jiao per person per day, would be an alarming amount. Moreover, if there is a lung disease patient in the family, there must be someone to take care of them. Therefore, in addition to the patient, at least one healthy person loses their ability to work. Therefore, from the perspective of a family's finances, it is truly unbearable.</p>
<p>The sacrifices to lung disease are mostly young people. This is because people around the age of twenty have a weaker resistance to tuberculosis. When we are around twelve or thirteen years old, we are generally invaded by tubercle bacilli, which lurk in various parts of the body. In the lungs, we build a natural barrier around the affected area. Often, before the barrier is strong, or because of excessive reading and work, insidious undermining, various unhygienic practices, and strenuous exercise, the barrier is destroyed, and various tuberculous symptoms gradually appear and the disease develops. Among these, strenuous exercise is the most harmful. Looking at various countries in the East and West, there are many athletes who develop lung disease after strenuous competition after each sports meeting. This is the evidence. In recent years, the promotion of sports in our country can be said to be extremely popular. However, if students have latent tuberculosis and their barriers are not strong, if they break down during competitive exercise, acute lung disease will suddenly erupt. Therefore, these students can only do small exercises and should rest after exercise. If they do strenuous exercise for a long time, it is tantamount to destroying their own lives. In the past, Mr. Gu Zheng, from Shanghai, and Mr. Xue Jianxia, from Wuxi, were famous for their sports and were leaders of students. They both suddenly died of acute pulmonary tuberculosis. As for the nameless heroes who developed their lung disease due to strenuous exercise, one does not know how many there are. Alas, the youth of a country are important members of the country. Now they are being ravaged by tuberculosis in this way, the loss of talent and the waste of treatment expenses are far greater than the annual civil war. From the perspective of the country, it damages the country's economy and impairs the vitality of the people. It is indeed a very important problem. Fortunately, in recent times, the pathology of tuberculosis has been gradually elucidated. At the same time, many practical experiences have shown that tuberculosis is not only easy to prevent but also easy to treat. The reason why it is not treated is that patients do not know that their body has the ability to defend itself and instead attach importance to insignificant medicines, or they miss the best opportunity for early treatment, or they become more confused about the treatment as the disease progresses, which leads to errors. Tuberculosis is very easy to treat in the early stages. Patients often let this period pass by without paying attention, and by the time they realize and pay attention to the true methods of health preservation, the disease has already reached an incurable stage. Alas, how sad.</p>
<p>The author has been engaged in the treatment of tuberculosis for many years and has a deep understanding of this concept. Therefore, I have resolved to contribute my insights to the world, intending to thoroughly explain the fundamental principles of treating tuberculosis and its preventive methods to the general public. This will allow patients who are wandering around, at a loss, to have an old horse who knows the way as a guide, or to have a bright light to illuminate the dim path, so that they will not be detoured into narrow paths and mistakenly believe them to be thoroughfares, or sail in broken harbors and flowing streams and arrive at the sea. This is why this book is named "Guide." If government officials add this book to national education so that it becomes common sense for the entire nation, then the whole country will have a clear understanding of lung disease and know that lung disease is not to be feared and can be cured by natural treatment. Not only will readers and their families be able to cope calmly and have plenty of resources when they develop the disease, but they will also have something to follow for prevention and can expect to achieve complete prevention. Some may say that the publisher of this book should not be selfish and seek self-interest with the copyright, but should make it public to society, allowing people to reprint it. Booksellers should only recover their costs to benefit readers. Or philanthropists can raise funds to print and distribute it widely, so that a new chapter can be opened in good books. Or, it may be said that if this</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>book becomes popular throughout the country, it will surely reduce the number of tuberculosis patients and their caregivers in the country and reduce the huge economic losses and unnecessary consumption of the people. This is to cultivate the vitality of the country, and it is still possible to do so if you plan for this. I said, "Yes, yes, I thought about doing my best for society in my youth, to show my humble efforts. But the days and months have passed above, and my body has weakened below. The year of sixty has suddenly arrived, and I am still curled up in the pile of books all day long, living and dying with bookworms. I still want to promote a book written in my spare time throughout the country, which seems to be beyond the power of an individual. What an individual can do is only to give up their copyright. If there are enthusiastic people who will delete, change, correct its shortcomings, and spread it widely, this is what I pray for day and night."</p>

<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: "Looking back at the field of national medicine, it bears the blame for being unsystematic and unscientific. It is not allowed to open schools, nor is it allowed to run hospitals. Research opportunities are far inferior to those of Western medicine, but their treatment results still exceed those of Western medicine. This is because Hu Shi suffered from nephritis in his early years. After precise examination and consultation by Western medicine, it was considered incurable. As a result, it was cured by the national doctor Lu Zhong'an... The wife of a certain German doctor suffered from appendicitis and underwent surgery. The pain after the surgery was unbearable. The German doctor had no solution and switched to the national doctor Lu Zhong'an for treatment and was cured... Wang Kai's brothers and sisters are both Western doctors. Their mother suffered from coughing and could not be cured by themselves. They switched to Liu Jixue, a member of the Legislative Yuan, for treatment and was cured... Liao Xiaoxun, an employee of the Zhongnan Hospital in Beijing, suffered from impetigo. He felt pain and had black spots all over his body from his mouth and nose down. Western doctors at the hospital could not cure him. He switched to Chen Xunzhai for treatment and was cured... Hu Shi, Qian Xuantong, Lu Zhong'an, Liu Jixue, and Chen Xunzhai are all well-known figures and can be easily verified. We believe that any kind of medicine that is effective in treating diseases should be promoted. However, the current Western doctors are unwilling to admit their shortcomings and are unwilling to admit the strengths of national medicine. Due to the former mentality, they will say that there are several organic diseases that cannot be cured in the end. Due to the latter mentality, they will say that there are several symptoms that will get better even without treatment. May I ask, to which category do the diseases mentioned above belong? To which category do they belong?" Mr. Jiao cited many examples to prove that national doctors can cure diseases that Western medicine cannot. However, regarding the pain of the wife of a certain German doctor, I can say with certainty that it is not true. Because scientific medicine has more effective painkillers than traditional Chinese medicine and works more reliably. The progress of surgery completely relies on painkillers. Ancient Chinese books say that Hua Tuo performed abdominal surgery with "mafeitang" (anesthesia). I know that there is definitely a solution for pain after surgery. Perhaps the parents, parents-in-law, or the wife herself of the German doctor did not fully trust scientific medicine or their own family members. They took a few doses of medicine without effect and insisted on consulting a traditional doctor. The German doctor could not refuse, but it was not that there was no solution. As for being cured after taking Lu Zhong'an's medicine, it was because the timing was right and it happened to coincide, or that taking Chinese medicine brought spiritual comfort and promoted the turning point of healing. Therefore, this example is probably unreliable. Other than this example, the rest may be true. I have not met most of the figures in the examples, only Mr. Hu Shi, who I had a long conversation with through the introduction of Chen Fang. I can roughly understand his nephritis experience. In my opinion, it was Mr. Hu's natural healing. I have many reasons to write below and discuss it with Mr. Jiao and the people of the country.</p>
<p>I have a classmate, Mr. He Zhizhen, who is now a surgery professor at Zhejiang Medical School. A few years ago, he suffered from chronic nephritis. Western doctors all diagnosed him with renal tuberculosis, which was very dangerous. Taking foreign medicine did not help, and taking Chinese medicine - which was a passive approach - also did not seem to help. Later, after resting for a year and a half, the slight fever in his body subsided, and there was no more protein or pus in his urine. Now he is very healthy. The grandson of Mr. Ju Ziqin and the son of Mrs. Ye Chu's sister suffered from chronic nephritis last year. I also suspected that he had renal tuberculosis. In addition to teaching them the methods of nursing and care, I used Tuberculin ointment for external application. After a few months, he actually recovered. It can be seen that chronic nephritis can also be cured without surgery.</p>
<p>Let me quote a passage from the chapter on renal tuberculosis in the "Urology" by Professor Leopold Casper of the University of Berlin in Germany for theoretical exploration. He said: "When it comes to the treatment of renal tuberculosis, there are two opposing schools of thought: palliative therapy and radical therapy. The former advocates the use of internal medicine drugs and tuberculin injections for cure. Lenhartz, Pielicke, and Karo are the representatives of this school. The latter advocates that all patients with renal tuberculosis must have the affected kidney removed as long as surgery is possible... Since the significance of tuberculosis as a national disease has been clarified, as a result, in recent times, the research on this disease has clearly flourished, and the results of its sincere research have taught us that the fact that tuberculosis can be cured exceeds what people have always suspected. Look at the effectiveness of pulmonary tuberculosis treatment, which is getting better and better day by day, as everyone knows. Bone, joint, and peritoneal tuberculosis treatment also has good results, which we also know. It can be seen that tuberculosis has the possibility of remission or cure. Even renal tuberculosis can be cured by preserving it. This can be inferred. However, does practical experience contradict this expectation? I am very sorry to have to answer "cannot be confirmed." The example cited by Lin is not very detailed, and it is difficult to get to the truth. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chapter 6: Medical and Pharmaceutical Education and Publications</p>
<p>Section 3: Periodicals on New and Old Medicine</p>
<p>Before the last ten years, there were very few Chinese-language publications in the field of new medicine. Medical science was especially not discussed in newspapers. Old medicine had no publications at all. In recent years, due to the efforts of practitioners of new medicine and the disputes between new and old theories, periodic publications have sprung up like mushrooms, flourishing for a time. According to my personal knowledge, there are nearly forty kinds nationwide, not including the advertisement-style magazines of various pharmaceutical factories and pharmacies. There are also more than ten kinds of old medicine publications, but some of them have mostly ceased publication midway. Now, I will classify and list these publications and introduce them to the readers, along with a discussion.</p>

<p>Based on the above table, there are as many as twenty-one new medicine and pharmacy publications published in Shanghai, accounting for more than half of the total number in the country. Schools in particular place great emphasis on them. On the surface, this seems to be a sign of the development of new medicine. However, upon careful reflection, there are also many things worth discussing. First, how many people in the new medical community in Shanghai are writing? Is it necessary to have twenty-one kinds of magazines? Second, if we look closely at the classification in the table, there are five kinds of popular reading materials, two kinds of medical and pharmaceutical reviews and discussions of medical administration, and two kinds of specialized academic discussions. The remaining twelve kinds are all ordinary medical and pharmaceutical journals. Although the level of the content varies somewhat, they are all reading materials for the medical and pharmaceutical community. I ask, does the number of practitioners of new medicine nationwide have the possibility of absorbing these more than ten kinds of publications published in Shanghai? Thinking from these two points, it is clear that these publications are also somewhat abnormally developed, and the above-mentioned malpractices have become undeniable facts. (1) Writers submit one manuscript to multiple publications. The authors found in various publications are always the same few prolific gentlemen. The essence cannot be concentrated. (2) Very few publications have large sales volumes. They are scattered and uneconomical. (3) Famous authors are solicited for contributions by various publications and must submit separate manuscripts to each publication, resulting in being exhausted. (4) Various publications have deadlines for publication and, due to a lack of manuscripts, are inevitably filled with perfunctory writing. (5) The editors of one publication cannot read all the other publications and adopt many identical texts from writers. Something that has already been seen in Publication A is republished in Publication B. (6) Various pharmacies and merchants, solicited for advertisements by various publications, also feel at a loss. They do not know which one to advertise in. Fearing that the effectiveness of advertising will be reduced, some pharmaceutical merchants have taken the initiative to run their own publications. (7) Although the above has classified the various publications according to their content, in reality, reviews also contain academic monographs, and magazines also contain articles on medical administration. The styles are mixed, which does not suit the taste of readers - all of this is something that our new medical community should gradually think about. Now, let's take the publications from other ports and list them in a table to compare with the publications in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Drinking Tea <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zhiyu</p>
<p>A certain company is having a sale again, so I went and bought two taels of good tea leaves, two dimes per tael. I started by brewing a pot, and fearing it would get cold quickly, I wrapped it in a cotton-padded jacket. But to my surprise, when I seriously came to drink it, the taste was almost the same as the coarse tea I usually drink, and the color was also very heavy and muddy.</p>
<p>I knew I had made a mistake. To drink good tea, you need to use a gaiwan. So I used a gaiwan. Sure enough, after brewing it, the color was clear and the taste was sweet, slightly fragrant and slightly bitter. It was indeed good tea. But this requires sitting quietly and doing nothing. When I was in the middle of writing "Eating Religion," I pulled it over for a drink, and the good taste unknowingly slipped away, and it was like drinking coarse tea again.</p>
<p>Having good tea to drink, and knowing how to drink good tea, is a kind of "pure blessing." But to enjoy this "pure blessing," you must first have the time, and second, the specially developed sense through practice. From this extremely trivial experience, I think that if it is a worker using physical strength, when his throat is dry and cracked, then even if you give him Longjing bud tea or Zhulan scented tea, I'm afraid he won't feel much difference from hot water when he drinks it. The so-called "autumn thoughts" are actually the same. Literary men and poets feel something like "Alas, the atmosphere of autumn," and the wind, rain, sunshine, and shade all give them a kind of stimulus, which is also a kind of "pure blessing" on the one hand. But the old farmer only knows that at this time, he must harvest the rice.</p>
<p>So some people think that this kind of delicate and sensitive feeling, of course, does not belong to the coarse people. This is the brand of the upper class. However, I am afraid that it is this brand that is about to close down. We have pain, which on the one hand makes us suffer, and on the other hand, it also enables us to defend ourselves. If we didn't have it, then even if someone stabbed us in the back with a sharp knife, we would be completely unaware, and we wouldn't understand why we fell to the ground until we were bled dry. But if this pain becomes delicate and sensitive, then not only will we feel a small thorn on our clothes, but even the seams, knots, and fluff on our clothes will be felt. If we don't wear "seamless heavenly clothes," he will be on pins and needles all day long and unable to live. But those who pretend to be sensitive are naturally not included in this example.</p>
<p>The delicacy and sensitivity of feeling, compared to numbness, is of course considered progress, but it is limited to what helps the evolution of life. If it is irrelevant, or even harmful, then it is an evolutionary disease that will soon come to an end. When we compare the elegant people who enjoy pure blessings and embrace autumn hearts with the coarse people who wear tattered clothes and eat simple food, we will understand who will ultimately survive. After drinking tea and looking at the autumn, I thought: It's okay not to know good tea and not to have autumn thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Hesitation <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Yunping</p>
<p>My wife sat there with a sad face, silently saying nothing.</p>
<p>For more than two months now, the three of us have only been able to eat one sheng of rice per day, half-starving. My wife complains and gets angry, which is no wonder. I straightened my back, rubbed my hands, and said in a low voice, "Let's do this: We'll definitely sell our cow to find that damn four or five yuan for Boss Wang. As for the rest, we'll just have to beg for leniency again! Sigh, without money, you're simply not human!"</p>
<p>My wife raised her withered face - what a miserable face it was! Those high cheekbones... those sunken eye sockets... those thin lips... She said:</p>
<p>"If we sell the cow, we'll starve to death next year. Boss Wang, how can he put on such a face? In previous years, didn't we always give him the full rent? With no sense of justice, he always says he doesn't care about the accounts! Even if you beat a monk to death, you can't cut off his queue. We don't even have enough to eat ourselves. If we don't ask him, what will we do!"</p>
<p>My wife has become irritable lately. She has changed from her previous habit of always discussing everything nicely. Whenever I see her like this, I just feel that it's my fault. I said apologetically:</p>
<p>"Next year - let's think of something next year. Heaven shouldn't cause another major flood like this year. The three of us can't survive on one sheng of rice per day! If we sell the cow, we can at least buy some rice. Long'er, we need to make cotton clothes too!"</p>
<p>"Sell it if you want, I don't care!" My wife turned her head away, and I heard the sound of sniffing. She was crying. If we don't sell the cow, what else can we do?</p>
<p>But I hesitated again in my heart: Sell? Sell to whom? How long will it last? What about later? - We have to think about the future too, because that will come soon!</p>

<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Thanks to the kindness of a friend, he let me be a distinguished guest at a Qingdao cafe.</p>
<p>Walking along the road from Huiquan, along the quiet seaside not far away, next to a sparse locust tree forest, there is a small Western-style house. Every day, after the setting sun hides behind the ripples, it attracts a group of men and women in brightly colored and luxurious clothes.</p>
<p>Let's go in! A waiter in white welcomes you with a smile. Passing through a corridor, you come to the hall. The walls are resplendent with wallpaper, and the electric lights are incandescent. The dance hall is in the center. Running out again, there is a seaside terrace with marble round tables, exquisite seats, arrogant smiles, hands with fingernails painted with red nail polish, and ruby-red grape juice in tall glasses...</p>
<p>Outside the stone railing of the terrace is a sea at night.</p>
<p>A nearly full moon is hanging in the sky.</p>
<p>There, the waves are endlessly leaping, jumping onto the beach. Splash - splash - each wave that hits the shore draws a silver-white lace. A mysterious sound. There, the moonlight is evenly spread on the sea surface, the sails of fishing boats are shifting in the distance, and on the other side, thousands of lights from the bustling city are flashing.</p>
<p>Taking a sip of cold coffee, what am I thinking in my heart?</p>
<p>The day before, I had eaten a cup of ice cream alone at the Huiquan Hotel. It was bland and inferior. But the price was half a yuan. How much is a cup of coffee here?</p>
<p>Half a yuan. Is it expensive? No! The big bosses who go there will definitely not be stingy with this small amount.</p>
<p>Popular jazz music started playing in the dance hall.</p>
<p>The waiters in white move respectfully. Knives and forks move rhythmically in the music, women's charming smiles, and gentlemen's polite gestures. Low whispers.</p>
<p>My friend started chatting with me.</p>
<p>He said that this Qingdao coffee shop was opened by a White Russian merchant. He only does business here for one summer every year (he has other businesses after the summer), but he can make a lot of money. He said that the Huiquan Hotel was opened by the Japanese - the economic power of Qingdao is entirely in the hands of the Japanese, and many factories are also run by them. Some put up signs saying they are Chinese capital, but behind the scenes, the shareholders are still Japanese... So I thought of the "Reception Commemoration Pavilion" near the seaside park. As long as it has been "received" in name, this is of course a great achievement worthy of "commemoration." Moreover, when our Qingdao was not given to Germany, it was originally just a barren island covered with weeds, but now they have built it like a flower cluster.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it, the lights dimmed.</p>
<p>Under the green gauze lamps, pairs of embracing men and women danced to the rhythm of the music.</p>
<p>I looked at the moon, at the sea covered with moonlight, at the white waves jumping onto the beach, and at the ghostly moving figures -</p>
<p>Be happy, friends. The night has not yet gone back, drink up the sweet wine in your glass!</p>
<h3 id="e198">Yuan Zhonglang Becomes an Official (Continued) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>Saying this to Chen also had no results. So, Zhonglang had to write a seventh letter, changing his strategy, and bluntly said, "As the saying goes, the ruler issues orders, and the subject follows his will. Now, the order of the Ministry is bound to be carried out, but can my will be bound by shackles? Besides handing over the seals and all the official documents to the government, I will leave with a wave of my hand!" After this much effort, Zhonglang finally managed to resign from his post as magistrate and return to his free life. At this time, his happiness was similar to when he first got the official position. He wrote to Nie Huanan:</p>
<p>Breaking the iron net, smashing the copper shackles, walking out of the mountain of knives and the forest of swords, and jumping into the cool Buddhist land, the joy is indescribable, indescribable! After resigning for several days, I increasingly feel the wonder of being without office... I have already arranged to wear a green hat and hold the tail of an ox... a person from the outside!</p>
<p>Zhonglang's dream of being an official completely ended here. He felt that his past life as an official was too bitter, so he traveled extensively to compensate for his own losses, roaming around for more than a year. At this time, his feelings were that "officialdom is getting further away, and the grave is getting closer. My heart is almost crazy! Foolish!" (To Zhao) Wuxi) Yuan Zhonglang also served as an official, and the process of becoming an official was roughly like this. Thinking of his embarrassment in office at that time, it is really laughable. I wonder what many officials of today will think after reading it?</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>Becoming an official is a blissful event that is unattainable in the eyes of most aspiring officials. However, Zhonglang insisted on calling it a bitter deal, and his foolishness is almost unmatched. However, why was Zhonglang so unwilling to be an official? There are reasons for this that must be explained. Here, I will further explain why Zhonglang was unwilling to be an official.</p>
<p>Not long after Zhonglang took office, he felt that it was a bit "difficult to be an official." He wrote a letter to Mao Taichu complaining, "I have obtained the post of magistrate of Wu, and the post is very troublesome and bitter, not as happy as an old farmer drinking wine and playing chess. From the very beginning, the taste was a bit wrong. He felt very troubled and bitter, and this meaning was repeated in his letter to Dr. Shen:</p>
<p>Being a magistrate of Wu is inhuman, and I almost don't know the difference between dawn and dusk, or the cold and heat! Why? There is as much money and grain as cattle hair, human feelings are as elusive as the wind, passing guests accumulate like mosquitoes, and superiors are as respectable as Yama. This is similar to what was said in his letter to Gong Weixue, "Passing guests are like hedgehogs, officials are like unicorns, and right and wrong are like shadows." But it is not as complete and thorough as what he said in another letter to Shen Guangcheng, where he revealed the troubles of being an official and the ugly states that must be possessed. He said:</p>
<p>Superiors are like clouds, passing guests are like rain, books and documents are like mountains, money and grain are like the sea. From morning to night, I rush to present and check, still fearing that I will not be able to keep up. How bitter! How bitter! However, superiors only need a humble skin and bones, passing guests only need a smiling face, books and documents only need a strong spirit, and money and grain only need a ruthless heart. It is bitter, but not difficult. Only the invisible right and wrong and the invisible waves, the green mountain can be transformed into waves, and the blue sea can be turned into dust, often making people unable to avoid them and having nowhere to escape. How difficult! How difficult!</p>
<p>Zhonglang expressed his indignation in this letter. His meaning is that being an official is not only troublesome and bitter, but also requires a humble and obsequious state. Not only is being obsequious not enough, but there are also idle rights and wrongs. In this way, the dignified Zhonglang was made too bitter and had to seek to leave. It is a pity that Zhonglang was still a kind and honest elder after all. He was unwilling to write more about the ugly states of being an official to complete a "portrait of officials," but only focused on the troublesome and bitter aspects. He himself stated a lot about the troubles and bitterness of being an official. In addition to what has already been mentioned, he said again in his letter to Chen Zhihuan:</p>
<p>The trouble and bitterness here cannot be described. Roughly speaking, I get up at the crowing of chickens and rest at the third watch of the night. Whenever I am exhausted, I often think of those in the world who sleep soundly all night, not knowing what blessings they must have cultivated. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e199">Goddess <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>- Dedicated to my good friend TK -</p>
<p>There are many things that always linger in my memory and often force me to write them down. In these unforgettable events, perhaps there is some kind of truth worth recording.</p>
<p>In fact, it was just a very ordinary encounter!</p>
<p>Two years ago, I went to a school in Guangzhou to teach. The school did not have lodging, and because I had only a small amount of travel expenses, I had to temporarily stay in a relatively economical small hotel.</p>
<p>The room was on the top floor, as big as a tofu square, with dirty walls, a dirty floor, a dirty bed, and dirty tables and chairs. Separated by only a layer of wooden boards, the rooms were lined up one after another, just like prisons. And without friends and not understanding the local language, I became such a lonely person.</p>
<p>Although the season had already passed Mid-Autumn Festival, the climate in the south was still so hot and humid. Rain seemed to always gather in the sea of ​​the sky, falling constantly. This suffocating climate made people feel very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>What was especially unpleasant was at night. After turning off the lights, staring at the dark space, I couldn't sleep. At this time, obscene sounds of men and women would come from the neighboring room, separated by only a thin board. At first, I seemed to be very disgusted, then I seemed to be listening quietly, and finally, I wrapped myself tightly in the quilt. ...</p>
<p>For a person drifting around, this situation was particularly embarrassing. On top of the loneliness, there was an added layer of physiological oppression. The raging tide of sexual desire finally broke through the embankment of morality, and all the defensive precautions in my heart were completely shattered.</p>
<p>"Call a girl! Call a girl!" The Guangdong porter, speaking an unintelligible Mandarin, would definitely ask this every night. Although he had received my cold face many times, he did not lose heart because of this. He must have been an expert in understanding the hesitant and weak state of mind of young travelers. He was like a giant hand of a demon, no matter what, he would catch you.</p>
<p>On this day, I had lost all restraint and smiled at him abnormally. This smile revealed the secret of my heart, causing him to approach me one step closer, making a despicable gesture and speaking many words that I could not fully understand, as if saying something secret. "Let me call one to take a look first! There is a particularly beautiful girl today!" He said and hurriedly turned to leave. He probably understood very well that the captured prisoner might change his mind soon.</p>
<p>In fact, the environment could no longer allow me to hesitate any longer. The porter, with a demonic smile of victory, left a young woman in my room and hurriedly turned away. At this time, my mood calmed down instead. I watched the woman's face and her figure with interest. She smiled charmingly at me, pretending to be shy. I still remember this woman's face, and I will remember it forever. She had some beauty, but she was unusually thin and emaciated. Apart from malnutrition and haggardness, there was nothing else distinctive about her.</p>
<p>She smiled and moved closer to me. From the strange fragrance she brought, there was a special meaty smell of a woman. This smell immediately made me feel disgusted with her, but I still maintained a smiling face. I shook my hand at her, telling her to sit on a chair opposite the table and not to approach me.</p>

<h3 id="e200">A Review of Technical Cooperation with the League of Nations <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Tian</p>
<p>Minister of Finance, Mr. Song Ziwen, took advantage of his participation in the Washington Conference and the World Economic Conference this year to establish a US$50 million cotton and wheat loan in the United States, and in Geneva, secured the passage of a resolution on technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations. Since this news spread, it has attracted deep attention from all parties at home and abroad. Japan views this move as a policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians" to resist Japan, and has repeatedly resorted to intimidation tactics in an attempt to sabotage it. Recently, it even sent Sugimura via Northeast China to secretly supervise. Domestically, public opinion has repeatedly elaborated on this matter. In addition to general agreement in principle, there is a keen awareness of the recent example of India, and a desire for the government to avoid giving others an opportunity to manipulate matters, leading to deeply entrenched problems and ultimately national subjugation.</p>
<p>We believe the importance of the issue lies in whether the League of Nations' technical cooperation can revive the Chinese economy. What preparations should China make at the start of this technical cooperation? Now, please first describe a general overview of the negotiations for technical cooperation with the League of Nations, to clarify the nature and scope of the cooperation.</p>
<p>(I) The Course of Negotiations for Technical Cooperation with the League of Nations</p>
<p>Technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations did not begin today. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it added a Ministry of Health, responsible for all matters related to national medical administration, disease prevention, and healthcare. In January 1929, Xue Dubi, in his capacity as Minister of Health, sent a letter to Dr. Rajchman, the Director of the Health Section of the League of Nations (currently the League of Nations' liaison officer in China), inviting him to come to China to assist with Chinese health affairs. In March, the League of Nations, following a resolution by the Executive Yuan, accepted Minister Xue's invitation. This marked the beginning of technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations. Subsequently, in May 1931, the League of Nations passed the National Government's proposal regarding technical cooperation, and thus technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations became concrete. At that time, the League of Nations dispatched four groups of specialized technical personnel to China: (1) Education Expert Group: tasked with investigating China's current education system, providing suggestions for improvement, and studying China's educational needs. (2) Engineering Expert Group: tasked with investigating issues such as river dredging, land reclamation, and road construction. (3) Economic Expert Group: tasked with investigating land, agriculture, planning industrial development, and assisting with flood relief. (4) Administrative Expert Group: tasked with studying Chinese administrative laws and regulations for the National Government's consultation.</p>
<p>For three years, although the Japanese invasion of China caused considerable obstacles to the progress of cooperation, it is said that it still achieved great efficiency. Therefore, during Mr. Song's visit to Europe, he further discussed technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China. The Council of the League of Nations met on July 3 to discuss this matter and decided to appoint a small committee to consider China's request, provide China with technical cooperation, and appoint specialized technical experts as liaison officers to enable the experts to cooperate when assisting China. On July 18, the small committee appointed by the League of Nations held its first meeting in Paris, chaired by the representative of Mexico, the Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations. Representatives from eight countries attended:</p>
<p>China - Song Ziwen, Gu Weijun  Italy - Poni</p>
<p>United Kingdom - Harvey  Norway - Stang</p>
<p>France - Massigli   Czechoslovakia - Asousky</p>
<p>Germany - Kedong   Spain - Ariwen</p>
<p>In addition, the United States, at the invitation of the committee, also sent a representative, Mr. McLane, to attend as an observer. The committee decided to appoint Dr. Rajchman as the League of Nations' liaison officer for technical cooperation in China and passed a resolution stating that the cooperation between the League of Nations and China was purely technical in nature, with no political relations, and stipulating that the liaison officer's term of office would be one year, with the following tasks: (1) to transmit information about various technical agencies of the League of Nations to China for reference; (2) to report China's requests for various technical cooperation to the League of Nations; (3) to assist China in selecting experts; (4) to investigate the work of the commissioners sent by the League of Nations and report to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The content of this cooperation is not yet entirely clear, but it is roughly as follows: (1) Construction of heavy industry (including the design of electric mining and other enterprises); (2) Water management; (3) Railway cooperation; (4) New sanitation facilities; (5) Agricultural improvement, etc. Compared with the previous cooperation, the most noteworthy is the cooperation in the construction of heavy industry. It is now reported that after the expanded organization of the National Economic Council, a subcommittee on technical cooperation with the League of Nations will be established within the council to handle the matter exclusively. Liaison Officer Rajchman is en route and will soon arrive in China. Subsequent developments will depend on the outcome of Rajchman's discussions with the National Government.</p>
<p>(II) Cooperation with the League of Nations and Economic Revival</p>
<p>The nature and scope of the League of Nations' cooperation with China are roughly as described above. So, does China need this cooperation? In principle, no one would give a negative answer. Mr. Martin, the editor of the *Journal de Genève*, recently traveled to China and wrote an article for *The China Critic* before returning to Europe, titled "The Significance of Technical Cooperation Between China and the League of Nations." In it, he mentioned China's need for this cooperation, saying, "In the economic sphere and in terms of national life, China today has a hundred things waiting to be done. It is necessary to enrich national equipment and adapt it to self-selected technical civilization. However, China obviously cannot complete this effort independently, because it has neither sufficient financial resources, nor sufficient technical personnel, nor the necessary resources for action." We agree with what this visitor from afar has said. Which aspect of China's construction does not require financial resources? Which aspect does not require technical personnel? Not to mention anything else, just looking at the five cooperative projects mentioned above: (1) In terms of heavy industry, the Central Steel Plant planned by the Ministry of Railways has not yet been completed. (2) In terms of water management, not to mention the previous floods, the annual Yellow River flood has reportedly affected 53 counties in four provinces, and although there are no statistics on the loss of life and property, it is known to be extremely tragic. (3) In terms of railways, for the most important trunk lines, such as the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, although some funds have been borrowed, construction has still not started on the uncompleted sections; other matters are even harder to discuss. (4) In terms of sanitation, although there have been some facilities in the major cities, in slightly more remote areas, countless people die from epidemics and from quack doctors. Who cares? (5) In terms of agriculture, rural bankruptcy and the farmers' cries of grievance need not be mentioned. In short, just these few points show the urgent need for financial resources and technical personnel. Moreover, China's national economy has already collapsed entirely. If emergency relief and fundamental governance are not carried out quickly, the Chinese nation will have only one way to go: to its death. In this sense, China does need technical cooperation with the League of Nations. This is a road to saving China, but it is a dangerous road. Why? Because China's economic situation is different from other countries.</p>
<p>The United States in the past and the Soviet Union in recent times have used foreign capital and foreign technical personnel to build their countries, but China cannot take them as examples. If we were to take the United States and the Soviet Union as examples, it would be better to take the subjugation of India as an example, because China's situation is more dangerous than India in the days of the East India Company. If China wants to revive its economy through technical cooperation with the League of Nations, first, it must exclude foreign economic forces: wherever there are concessions, the chimneys of foreign factories are billowing smoke. With strong capital and advanced technology and equipment, using the low wages of Chinese workers and avoiding taxes, can Chinese manufacturers compete with their products? The most important textile industry has been completely defeated. Customs duties cannot be fully autonomous, and the flood of foreign goods submerges all industries that are just budding. The anti-dumping tax law that was decided by the central government has still not been implemented. Isn't it a fact that Japan is obstructing it? There is no end to such things. We feel that if foreign forces are not excluded and industries are not protected, there is no talk of revival. Even if cooperation with the League of Nations is successful, it will only allow imperialists to suck a few more drops of blood from China's poor people. Second, we must talk about financial resources and technical personnel: it is true that China has no financial resources and needs foreign capital; it is also true that China lacks technical personnel and needs foreign technical personnel. But financial resources depend on people, and technology also depends on people. At a time when imperialists are fighting each other for market share, and the Chinese government is so weak and incompetent, can we guarantee that they will not become the masters of the house? Moreover, the forces of imperialism have already penetrated deeply into China and are deeply entrenched, and it is impossible to exclude them. Can we now guarantee that they will not make further inroads? The sincerity of imperialists is probably harder to find than panaceas, and China's wishful thinking is probably not so easy. The facts are still to come, but if the technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China and the foreign capital of friendly countries can save China's economic crisis, then the "ill-fated" Chinese people should be grateful.</p>
<p>(III) Our Necessary Preparations</p>
<p>Technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China is acceptable in principle, but it is very difficult in practice and contains many dangerous elements. But "since the matter has been decided," rather than making passive criticisms and unfounded worries, it is better to talk about the necessary preparations. However, we hope that in the future, for such major events concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood, it is best not to make decisions in advance, and then have a "ratification" afterwards, even if it is in full compliance with legal procedures, so that the people can have the opportunity to contribute their humble opinions after the liberation of the regime.</p>
<p>Regarding technical cooperation, China's own preparations should first examine the achievements of the experts sent by the League of Nations in the past. For example, the reports drafted by the former engineering experts Polier and Goode on the Huai River diversion, North China water conservancy, and Shanghai port construction, and the reports of agricultural experts Tragornie and Bailey on land improvement and agriculture, which can be adopted, which can be used for reference, and which are difficult to implement, should all be organized. Otherwise, the old plans will still be shelved, untouched, and new experts will come to China, and they will do another round of investigations, research, and reports. Isn't this a redundant and superfluous exercise, or just an accumulation of plans, which will not help in reality? Why do we spend money to borrow foreign technical personnel? Second, China certainly lacks technical personnel and financial resources, but there is probably no other country in the world that wastes talent and money like China. In addition to graduates from domestic universities, students who are cultivated with national treasury funds, provincial funds, or private funds go abroad every year in batches, and every year they return with doctorates, master's degrees, and bachelor's degrees, but their only outlets are to become officials and teachers. As for where the foreign and domestic debts of the past decades have been used, no one knows. Although finances have been difficult in recent years, there are still many nominal and lucrative positions that are being maintained. Why not cut them to supplement cultural expenditures? In short, talents cannot be placed where they belong; this is the current symptom. Now that cooperation with the League of Nations is about to begin, although we feel that our talents are scattered and lacking, we should try to concentrate them and make their learning useful. Suggestions from foreign countries are only for reference. The main body is within us, and we should not be manipulated by others. In addition to foreign capital, there are still many redundant institutions that can be cut, and many expenditure items can be discussed, and we should try to invest them in construction projects. Third, the movement to revive China's economy is indeed a difficult task, and we should draw big strokes and start with small details. Rather than making several impractical five-year and ten-year plans, it is better to promote them step by step and carry them out on a small scale. Fourth, preparations for total mobilization; the work procedures should start from small details, but since the danger of China's economy lies in the collapse of the entire national economy, the development of the work must be popularized in all regions and in all aspects, so preparations for total mobilization are necessary. In short, technical cooperation with the League of Nations has now been decided to proceed. If we rely solely on other people's funds, which are foreign, and talents, which are foreign, and we ourselves have no preparations, this is an extremely dangerous thing.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Current Situation and Future of Chinese Industry <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zongfan</p>
<p>On the surface, in the past twenty years, Chinese industry cannot be said to have made considerable progress. Here, only the industrial situation in Shanghai is taken and divided</p>
<p>into two periods, before 1912 and the most recent, for comparison, which will make it clear.</p>
<p>(I) Before 1912, there were only 101 factories in Shanghai, but by 1930, the total number of factories, large and small, reached 1,781. In the short span of 19 years, the forces of industrial capitalism, centered on Shanghai, expanded more than tenfold.</p>
<p>(II) Before 1912, there were only 20 silk reeling factories in Shanghai. By 1930, this had increased to 107. As for the textile industry, in 1912 there were only 32 yarn factories with 835,354 spindles and 4,038 looms. By 1932, this had increased rapidly to 128 yarn factories with 4,516,898 spindles, 387,890 thread spindles, and 42,596 looms.</p>
<p>This surprising development of production scale can illustrate the example of the development of Chinese capitalism.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the perspective of production concentration, the current production capital, productivity, and production volume have increased dozens of times compared with twenty years ago, so that the increase in the number of factories by ten or dozens of times has reached hundreds of times!</p>
<p>The long-term progress and development of Chinese industrial capitalism are even more bluntly expressed in China's foreign export trade statistics, which are listed below for comparison:</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Sharp increase in machinery imports (unit: customs taels)</p>
<p>1913 4,650,001</p>
<p>1923 26,677,796</p>
<p>1932 66,844,046</p>
<p>Sharp increase in raw material imports:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton imports (unit: piculs)</p>
<p>1923 134,735</p>
<p>1921 1,682,526</p>
<p>1932 4,652,726</p>
<p>(2) Wheat imports (unit: customs taels)</p>
<p>1920 305,279</p>
<p>1931 87,639,000</p>
<p>1932 51,831,000</p>
<p>(3) Imports of match-making materials (unit: customs taels)</p>
<p>1921 2,280,000</p>
<p>1927 2,258,000</p>
<p>1932 1,317,763</p>
<p>(4) Imports of chemical industry raw materials (unit: customs taels)</p>
<p>1837 682,236</p>
<p>1927 24,800,000</p>
<p>Sharp increase in exports of machine-made foreign goods:</p>
<p>1923 1927 1931</p>
<p>Coarse cloth 3,629 12,699 12,229,000</p>
<p>Cotton yarn 4,345 19,769 34,224,000</p>
<p>Cement 177 476 1,004,203</p>
<p>Carpets 4,691 6,525 4,548,909</p>
<p>Dyes 10 1,730 4,34</p>
<p>Note: Cement is the export amount for 1930.</p>
<p>The sharp increase in machinery imports to China indicates the gradual development of new-style industries using machinery in China. The increase in imports of industrial raw materials—cotton and wheat—indicates the development of the textile industry and the flour industry. The sharp increase in imports of chemical industrial raw materials and match-making materials also carries the meaning of the prosperity of the chemical industry as a whole. As for the sharp increase in overseas exports of machine-made foreign goods, it illustrates a major breakthrough in Chinese industry.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>In this way, Chinese industrial capitalism has emerged with the progress of the Chinese revolution, and has been further affected by the World War. Later, due to the revision of Chinese tariffs and the Japanese industrial investment in China, Chinese entrepreneurs were stimulated to imitate, so Chinese industrial capitalism gradually completed considerable development in the cities, and at the same time, capitalism embryos were also nurtured in the countryside. Therefore, in the above-mentioned process of Chinese industrial capitalism development, the collapse of Chinese inherent handicraft industry is an inevitable fact (the collapse of Chinese handicraft industry is the result of the rapid development of Chinese industrial capitalism, and the invasion of imperialist commodities also has a major relationship).</p>
<p>Not to mention the old-style silk weaving and home-spun industries, even the porcelain, straw hat, mill, old-style paper making, and ramie cloth industries are gradually declining, and the fundamental reasons for the collapse of handicraft industry are (1) the gradual dissolution of the historical tasks it bears. (2) Special products made with special superior natural conditions have produced other substitutes. (3) The increase in tax burden has become the enemy of new-style machine-made industrial products. In other words, it is impossible for Chinese handicrafts to compete with the machine industry, which is also an example of the development of Chinese industrial capitalism.</p>
<p>However, the aforementioned long-term progress and development of Chinese industrial capitalism is only a general fact. When analyzing its stages in detail, it is necessary to examine the significant role of imperialist economic forces in China. Let's look at the amount of imperialist investment in China and its types:</p>
<p>Imperialist investment in Chinese railways</p>
<p>UK 123,000,000</p>
<p>France 7,000,000</p>
<p>Japan 59,000,000</p>
<p>US 19,000,000</p>
<p>Germany 48,000,000</p>
<p>Netherlands 13,000,000</p>
<p>Comparison of Chinese and foreign bank capital (unit: yuan)</p>
<p>Authorized capital Paid-up capital</p>
<p>Foreign banks 591,000,000 682,000,000</p>
<p>Chinese-foreign joint ventures 150,000,000 104,000,000</p>
<p>Chinese banks 375,000,000 138,000,000</p>
<p>Imperialist investment in Chinese telegraphs and telephones</p>
<p>Country Number of companies Investment amount</p>
<p>UK 3 1,210,548,000 yuan</p>
<p>Germany 2 470,000</p>
<p>Japan 4 450,092,000</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign investment in mining (unit: yuan)</p>
<p>Capital amount Annual output</p>
<p>China 50,000,000 7,000,000</p>
<p>UK 23,000,000 7,000,000</p>
<p>Japan 77,500,000 4,500,000</p>
<p>Imperialist heavy industry in China</p>
<p>Shipbuilding factories 22</p>

<p>Japan 200,000,000</p>
<p>UK 20,000,000</p>
<p>China 130,000,000</p>
<p>From the above statistics, eight or nine out of ten railways were built with foreign capital, and most of them are still in the hands of foreign countries; foreign-run banks account for three-quarters of the bank capital, and Chinese-run banks account for one-quarter; foreign capital accounts for two-thirds of the mining industry; most of the heavy industry is in the hands of foreigners; and the textile industry, which occupies the main position in light industry, is the same. Foreign capital accounts for two-thirds. In other aspects of shipping, foreign capital also accounts for the majority, and most of the commodities with an annual import and export value of about 3 billion are transported by foreign-capital-operated merchant ships.</p>
<p>Chinese industrial capitalism takes large cities as its center. Regardless of how far it has developed, the facts show that the position occupied by national industry is extremely weak. Therefore, in the textile industry in light industry, it is mostly oppressed by Japanese yarn factories in China. Chinese yarn factories have not only fallen into a state of poverty and exhaustion, but are also encountering a fate of total bankruptcy. Moreover, the biggest defect of Chinese industrial capitalism is the lack of development of basic industries, especially in the heavy industry and mining sectors, which must be much more immature than in advanced capitalist countries. The reason for the underdevelopment of Chinese heavy industry is that the purpose of industrial investment in colonies and semi-colonies by imperialist powers is only to extract surplus value, without paying any attention to the growth and decline of the national economic interests of the colonies and semi-colonies. Light industry, which attaches the most importance to the rate of surplus value extraction, rarely pays attention to heavy industry. In this way, the expansion of imperialist investment in China not only cannot promote the development of Chinese industrial capitalism, but also promotes the collapse of handicraft industry, and hinders the development of emerging national industry. This significant fact is extremely worthy of people's attention.</p>
<p>The role of imperialist exports is to prevent the basic elements of Chinese emerging national industrial growth. This is just as Marx said: "Imperialist goods, like fierce cannons, destroyed the city walls of China." This is a well-known fact and does not need to be analyzed in detail. However, China is still in a semi-colonial state, and customs duties are not completely free. The inevitable result is that national industries cannot enjoy the protection of increased tariff barriers, and because of the world panic in recent years, imperialist powers are desperately competing for international markets as the first step to open up the panic. The competition is particularly fierce in China, the world's only big market. Therefore, the national industrial products of China's immature industries have not only narrowed down domestic sales channels, but also lost newly developed overseas sales channels. Under this circumstance, the fate of Chinese national industries has to be subjected to the double invasion of imperialist exports and investment in China.</p>
<p>In this way, the development of Chinese industrial capitalism—the economic power in China, otherwise it is absolutely impossible. This is the basic condition for promoting Chinese industry. And to make Chinese capitalism embark on the right track of development, that is the secondary basic condition. And Chinese capitalism has not yet combined industrial capital and bank capital. In fact, from their essence and natural conditions, it is impossible to combine industrial capital and bank capital.</p>
<p>In short, the development of a country's capitalism must continue the stage of capital concentration and accumulation, and then the combination of bank capital and industrial capital can be realized. The promotion of national industry is only possible by following the normal development process of capitalism. How to mobilize the abnormally developed Chinese bank capital at present to make it industrial capital is a very necessary research.</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Future of Chinese Handicraft Industry <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>Human history, after several transformations, has progressed from primitive communism to the highest stage of present-day capitalism. Today’s society, the so-called "high-speed era," presents us with airships in the sky, automobiles on the ground, submarines beneath the ice, and capitalists' mass production of goods; everything revolves around gas, electricity, and machinery. To have someone (such as Mr. Taylor, etc.) advocating handicrafts in this context, seeking to restore the production methods of the medieval era, one cannot help but call it a "great step backward," can one?</p>
<p>In modern nations, handicrafts, aside from various businesses primarily focused on repair or art, have virtually no room for development or existence. However, today's China is just beginning its industrial revolution, trudging along the road. While a portion of the major urban centers are gradually becoming industrialized with machinery, the majority of rural areas remain stagnant in a semi-feudal, small-scale production mode. Moreover, rural areas are being devastated by external forces, and internal contradictions are erupting, accelerating their collapse. The so-called "local bandits and Red bandits" are seizing the opportunity to rise up, causing unrest in neighborhoods and shaking the foundations of the nation. Thus, it is necessary to seek "stability measures." As a result, the cry for "rural revival" resounds throughout the land, and various palliative and fundamental solutions are emerging, such as "restoring the granaries," "establishing Baojia (household registration system)," "ox plowing competitions," "specially contracted farmland," and "reforming the pawnshop industry," etc.; and "promoting handicrafts" is also one of them. Look, isn't Shanghai currently hosting a "native cloth exhibition"!</p>
<p>What exactly is the relationship between handicrafts and the rural economy? Everyone knows that the three factors of production are labor, means of labor, and objects of labor, among which human labor is the most important. Therefore, to increase production capacity, one must first improve "labor efficiency"; to improve "labor efficiency," one must first improve "labor organization" and "labor system." Agricultural labor differs from industrial labor, as it is constrained by the weather, making even distribution difficult. As the ancients said, "spring sowing, summer weeding, autumn harvest, winter storage." By the end of winter and early spring, agricultural tasks are completed, and most farmers are "idle with their hands in their sleeves"; while during the late summer and autumn, due to busy farming, they often have to "work day and night." Therefore, considering the entire rural area, there is often a "labor shortage" in the summer and autumn, and a "labor surplus" in the spring and winter. Labor wages fluctuate frequently due to the "law of supply and demand," leading to extremely unstable lives for agricultural laborers. Landless peasants or poor farmers rely on selling their labor to make a living. During slack seasons, wages drop, or there may be no work at all, forcing them to flow to other villages, becoming "migrant laborers" (Hobo or Hobgahger); or they concentrate in cities, forming a "reserve army of labor." Therefore, rural laborers often tend to be deficient, not only decreasing in quantity but also deteriorating in quality. The so-called "rural exodus" (Landflucht) has become a major problem in capitalist society's agricultural management and economy. Thus, some people advocate promoting rural handicrafts so that farmers can engage in cultivation during busy farming seasons and devote themselves to crafts during slack seasons. This way, not only can the supply and demand of agricultural labor be adjusted, but it can also greatly benefit the rural household economy, truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>However, where does the "rural exodus" mainly stem from? Can promoting handicrafts resolve rural contradictions? We can find out by first examining whether handicrafts themselves have room for existence. Handicrafts primarily use "tools" as a means of processing. "Tools" differ from "machines," as their entire or main parts must be used or operated by human physical strength. Therefore, the characteristics of handicrafts lie in: (1) no division of labor (Subkiviaion of Work); the entire processing of a product is completed by the same person as a principle. (2) Processing techniques often require meticulous training to be successful; and technical training typically involves long-term apprenticeship. (3) The production of products is carried out by the processor using their own long-practiced unique tools and skills, so it often carries personal characteristics.</p>
<p>But modern industry uses machines as a means of processing. (1) Machines mostly perform automatic actions driven by power, so their processing power is strong, capable of performing work beyond human power; and they greatly reduce human physical labor. (2) Machine processing is precise, enabling products to be "uniform" and achieve "mass production." (3) Machines can reduce the need for manual skill, gradually eliminating the old "apprenticeship system." (4) Machine operations are fast and continuous, so they can increase production volume and reduce production costs. (5) Machines can help human power conquer nature, making the collection and supply of raw materials abundant and easy (see Huang Tong's Outline of Industrial Policy, Chapter 3, Sections 1 and 2). Thus, comparing "tools" to machines is like comparing a "tank" to a "broadsword troop." It is truly terrifying to think that handicrafts want to achieve miraculous victories with such crude weapons.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in modern nations, handicrafts, aside from a portion of special businesses primarily focused on repair or art, have virtually no room for existence or development. Since handicrafts cannot maintain their own existence, they are naturally powerless to resolve rural contradictions. China's rural areas cannot rely on the assistance of handicrafts to "turn back the tide"; they must open up a new path. However, enthusiastic individuals in society are currently busy with the "native cloth movement," wanting to resist "machine-woven fabrics" with "hand-woven products." While their courage is commendable, how can they defy the times! Therefore, the conclusion of this article is: when we advocate for national goods, we do not need to be nostalgic for medieval handicrafts; we must build modern national industries. We do not need to step backward; we must stride forward on the road to industrial revolution. (September 20, 1933)</p>

<p>Yesterday was another regular Sunday; banks were closed as usual. However, while money shops were still open, the situation was weak. The silver exchange rate was nine cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions, and transactions of exchange notes were also rare. In the morning session, 3.78 million yuan were transferred, with 560,000 yuan in new transactions. In the afternoon session, 440,000 yuan were transacted, and in the small general association, 500,000 yuan were transacted. Banks had no receipts; money shops received over 34 million yuan in silver public bills. Receipts for silver clearing accounts were not available due to the market closure. The market price of auxiliary currency, Jiangnan small silver, was 835 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions, with transactions made only in the morning session for 4,000 jiao. Guangdong small silver was 783.8 yuan in the morning session and 784.8 yuan in the afternoon session, with transactions made in the morning session for 30,000 jiao and in the afternoon session for 45,000 jiao. Copper coins were adjusted to 500 cash longer, totaling 307,500 cash, with 30,750 strings of cash transacted.</p>

<p>Qianyuan Fuji Exchange Shop in Shi Jia Nong, Nanshi, has been open for over 30 years. It has been reorganized several times, with shareholders including Zheng and Yao, with a total capital of 220,000 yuan. Suddenly, the day before yesterday (i.e., September 30), due to the end-of-month settlement, it was unable to manage its cash flow, lacking only 65,000 yuan, leading to its closure. The manager of the shop, Shen Luyingkang, who also works at a certain bank, similarly announced a temporary suspension of business yesterday.</p>

<p>Dominated by the North China Incident</p>
<p>A Review of the Twists and Turns in the Bond Market Last Week</p>
<p>As a Result, the October Term Only Fell by One or Two Jiao to Four or Five Jiao</p>
<p>Last week, from September 25th to 30th, the market price of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange fluctuated significantly. Initially, due to the serious situation in North China, the market price experienced a significant decline. Subsequently, as the situation improved, the market price rebounded quickly. Finally, it fell again due to rumors of President Wang's resignation. Although the turmoil was great, the fluctuations were also rapid. This was partly due to the short selling by the Northern Gang and the squeeze on short covering as the delivery date approached. For example, on Monday, due to only two days remaining for September transactions and the deteriorating situation in North China, coupled with the unconfirmed rumors that "96" could not be reorganized, a sharp decline occurred. However, at the same time, there were also many who covered their short positions in the September term, which helped to maintain some momentum. Each decline was less than one yuan, and several stocks even recovered by several jiao at the closing. However, they had already fallen by two or three jiao to 1.67 yuan. On Tuesday, the situation in North China became even more tense. It was the last day of the September term. A large number of "21" long positions were released, and the military cuts plummeted by 2.67 yuan. However, the market then rebounded due to short covering, with the decline limited to two or three jiao to 1.23 yuan. On Wednesday, only the October term was traded. Due to rumors that the Fang army had fled elsewhere, Tianjin and Beijing were said to be safe. Retail investors covered their short positions the fastest, and the market price unanimously rebounded by several jiao to one yuan. On Thursday, the November term was auctioned, and the market price continued to rise by half a yuan. Friday was a market holiday due to the delivery of the September term. On Saturday, rumors suddenly spread that President Wang had resigned and Minister Song was passive. Although the authorities denied the rumors, people were still skeptical. Although there was no significant change in the market price, major players sold short, causing a further decline of five or six jiao. As a result, the September term fell by several jiao to over two yuan, while the October term only fell by one or two jiao to four or five jiao. The trend is expected to improve once the political rumors subside and short positions are covered. The total turnover was 64,414,700 yuan, including 917,000 yuan in spot trading. Futures trading was dominated by unified salt tax, accounting for 21,610,000 yuan, military cuts accounting for 8,765,000 yuan, "19" customs duties accounting for 6,090,000 yuan, "20-volume 20-customs" accounting for 10,945,000 yuan, "consolidated 696" accounting for 10,020,000 yuan, and reorganization and short-term gold accounting for 5,150,000 yuan. The remaining transactions ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. Although trading lasted only five days, the turnover was quite active.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed and indecisive. It initially fell due to Southern hedging sales, but then rebounded due to buying by the same industry. As a result, spot prices rose by five points, and futures prices rose by four to seven points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by four points, and futures prices fell by nine points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by one point. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to long position liquidations, but then rebounded due to speculative buying. As a result, Pingal fell by 2 rupees 7.5 annas, Olmura fell by 3.5 rupees, and Bai Luxi fell by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 30th).</p>

<p>South Shanghai: More than 20 boats from the He Gang wharf arrived, and sales were even weaker than yesterday. Fortunately, there were not many arrivals, and distributors tried their best to push sales, so market prices were still able to rise. Therefore, although the stocks of Changbang and Su Tongbang broken rice were low, prices continued to rise by a few jiao. Due to the even greater scarcity of Nanhai thick rice arrivals, prices rose by another two jiao. Although Qingjiao Song Sibang thin rice rose by a few jiao, the trend was no longer optimistic, as visiting merchants were all bystanders and seemed to have stopped. Although Northern merchants were active, the quantity was only two loads of Songjiang rice and one load of Qingjiao special rice. Each new tip was acceptable, and the Ningbo merchants actively purchased two or three hundred bags of new Yang tip. The local demand for Lujian and Jiaobai tips remained good, and prices continued to rise by nearly a chi. New Geng rice also stood out, and prices increased by several points.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a sharp increase in the arrival of coarse granulated white sugar from the recent round of "24" shipments. The market sentiment trended downward. The association's clearing price for spot goods was 20.65 yuan, down 0.15 yuan from the previous day. One to two hundred bags were transacted. Medium granulated white sugar from the "20" shipment was priced at 20.8 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. Ordinary "89" Dutch red sugar was priced at 16.4 yuan. Taikoo sugars were down 0.05 yuan each. B Mark was priced at 21.65 yuan, CW Mark was priced at 0.5 yuan, DY Mark was priced at 0.25 yuan, and HX Mark was priced at 20.9 yuan. Zhonghua Guohua Zhenji's own factory's refined white sugar each called for 0.05 yuan lower. No. 1 was priced at 20.65 yuan, and the rest followed the downward trend. There were still shortages, and no transactions were made. Zhenxing factory's No. 1 medium bag of own brand crystal sugar was sold slightly due to immediate sale limitations. The offer price was relatively favorable, at 22.7 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Environment of Shanghai: Fire <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>History tells us that eighty years ago, Shanghai was nothing more than a desolate fishing village. But now, it has not only become China's unique metropolis but also a metropolis in East Asia and one of the world's leading metropolises. To put it bluntly, we, this unenterprising generation of Chinese, should bow three times and sincerely thank the foreigners for their benevolence. Because although Shanghai is a clearly Chinese land, it is, in reality, the prosperity created under the skills of foreigners.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Shanghai over the past eighty years has evolved in extreme deformity, contradiction, and sin. The environment it has formed makes people stumble and fall everywhere and at all times. After all, people change with the environment. The so-called individual strength and outstanding self-restraint can only maintain oneself at most. For the most part, one is bound to be unable to jump over the high walls of this harsh environment and will inevitably be devoured by it. Analyzed, Shanghai has these kinds of harsh environments: First, it deprives you of your national identity. Our compatriots, struggling for survival, encounter setbacks everywhere and have no way out. Then, foreigners offer their leftover scraps as bait, causing most of our compatriots to wag their tails and beg in vain. We see that positions in foreign firms are extremely rare and well-paid jobs. Once you get one, as long as you are as tame as a Pekingese, the foreign boss will promote you step by step, with annual raises and end-of-year bonuses. This makes the compatriots who live by cowering beneath them scrub themselves clean. Other than the black hair and yellow skin, which have no cure and are an ultimate regret, everything else is Westernized. Everything is done only for others, up to this point, national identity is completely obliterated, and one willingly becomes a great citizen of a sub-colony.</p>
<p>Second, it gives you only a monetary concept. Originally, the prosperity of Shanghai was entirely built on money. What one hears and sees is only the activity of money. Other than this, there is nothing to say. Chasing money makes you a tycoon and hero, otherwise you are a fool and idiot. In fact, only those with money can gain a foothold. As a result, robberies occur endlessly, and all kinds of speculative transactions, fraud, extortion, and robbery are always present. The result is bankruptcy and ruin, and many people become unmanageable.</p>
<p>Third, because there is only a frantic pursuit of money, it is followed by a kind of shameless behavior. In dealing with the world, everyone only cares about the goal and does not choose the means. If the goal can be achieved, no matter how base the means are, there is always a possibility of covering them up. The so-called sense of honor and shame, people living in Shanghai, truly do not know that humans need such a virtue that has little to do with practical life. Can you find it? How many people in Shanghai have a sense of honor and shame? And how many of the behaviors exhibited are in accordance with honor and shame?</p>
<p>Fourth, is the contagion of bad habits. There are many facts that can prove this. Prostitution and gambling become public, the sale of heroin and opium, and the popularity of lottery associations all cause people to fall. Parents advocate them above, and children learn them step by step, passing them down from generation to generation. Alleyways are prevalent with coin tossing and gambling-like lottery drums and roulette wheels. Growing up in this kind of environment, you say you want him to be a decent person, it is simply impossible in reality.</p>
<p>It is truly unknown when this terrible Shanghai environment will be able to turn around.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, the daughter of a local woman is truly beautiful! Born with a captivating charm and graceful figure, she resembles an angel from heaven. She attends a school not far from home, carrying her satchel to class every morning and returning home with it in the afternoon. Her steps are so light, and her graceful figure is further enhanced. The shopkeepers in the densely packed street shops crane their necks to watch her pass by; hurried – or perhaps leisurely – passersby also shift their gazes, looking at her again and again. Her beautiful appearance is indeed imaginable. In Alley 30, there lives a young man, tall and handsome, with a flirtatious demeanor, a veritable gigolo. It's said he works as a clerk in a foreign firm. After seeing this angel descended from heaven that day, his soul almost flew away. After careful consideration that night, he devised a plan and, the next day, deployed all his skills to woo this young woman.</p>
<p>A few days later, one evening, the alley was suddenly crowded with men, women, old, and young, mixed with cries, curses, and laughter. According to a nosy Ningbo native, he told the reporter: "The 'desperate' young man from number 30 and the young lady from number 30 were caught 'shacking up'! Today, the girl's mother discovered it and was immediately furious, wanting to drag this young man to court!"</p>

<p>Two years ago, A-da's mother often said with a smile to her relatives and friends: "It's okay! In our family, even after two years of arguing, no matter how bad our luck is, at least we can get a mediocre position like A-da's father's. When the two of them start earning money, our family will be doing very well. Maybe A-da will find a more promising position in the future, and then our family will have great hope!" She said, filled with joy.</p>
<p>After A-da's mother exhausted two years of effort, A-da finally graduated this year, as they had hoped. It's been three months since he "graduated"! At first, when he returned home with his colorful diploma, everyone seemed a little happy, couldn't help but take the diploma to admire it, and wished A-da a bright future, as if he could become a high official and make a fortune immediately. But this enthusiasm didn't last long. After a while, many people saw him as the same as before he graduated, and everyone gradually became indifferent to him. A-da's mother also began to worry, feel distressed, and become annoyed, and no longer heard those words she had said before. Until now, A-da is still the same, staying at home, and even his father's mediocre position is unattainable. A-da's mother, besides begging her relatives and friends for help, is complaining and blaming everything at home all day long!</p>

<p>Little Sanzi is pushing his cart again! Every morning, he pushes his dilapidated cart to the street, places it on the roadside, and cranes his neck waiting for customers to arrive. Strangely, other carts, trams, and buses are all doing brisk business, either too busy to cope or so crowded that passengers are almost pushed off. Even rickshaws are full of people, running wildly on the streets, but Little Sanzi's cart is idle all day long. Not to mention anyone hiring him, even "ghosts" seem to dislike him!</p>
<p>Neighbors who see Little Sanzi's recent situation are all extremely worried about him. He has already been to prison three times in these few years! All three times were because he secretly sneaked into wealthy people's homes to steal things, was caught by the patrol, and taken to the police station to "suffer." The first time, he was released after a day. At that time, the neighbors advised him to "turn over a new leaf" and never do such "self-destructive" things again. But the neighbors didn't give him a concrete way to "turn over a new leaf." Although he still pushed the dilapidated cart his family owned out every day, the result was always no business. Unable to bear the hunger, he finally fell into the same fate as the first time and came out after another two months. Of course! That time was the same again, and soon he went to prison for the third time. That time, he was imprisoned for more than half a year. Moreover, the police station seriously warned him. If he committed a fourth offense, he might be expelled from the concession forever! Although it has only been more than two weeks since he came out, the path he is taking is still the same as the one he took before, I am afraid that he will return to that path!</p>

<p>Sunlight entered the bedroom through the window, and Sha lazily opened his eyes. He yawned, and weakly sat up.</p>
<p>"A-Lu! Wash water!"</p>
<p>The school servant carried in a basin of water and gently placed it on the table.</p>
<p>"What time is it?" Sha asked.</p>
<p>"It's only the second class!" A-Lu said, "The teacher isn't teaching!"</p>
<p>"Annoying, the first class is history, the second is Party Principles, who wants to attend! Bring me a bowl of fried noodles!"</p>
<p>He washed his face and got dressed. The noodles arrived. After eating the noodles, he left the dormitory.</p>
<p>"Hey, Xiao Wang!" Sha said softly to a classmate sitting in the classroom listening to the lecture, "Come out, I want to talk to you!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Xiao Wang asked as he came out.</p>
<p>"The third class is Chinese Literature, please mark me as present." "What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, I want to rest for a while."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see! What about the fourth class?"</p>
<p>"I can't skip that one, old man Hu is really hard to deal with."</p>
<p>He went to the dormitory and closed the door. He pushed aside the books, matches, cigarette butts, and other things piled on the desk, clearing a space. He took out a letter paper and carefully wrote a love letter to his sweetheart.</p>
<p>Before he finished writing, the third class was over! Sha seemed a little annoyed, time passed too quickly!</p>
<p>He found his Higher Algebra book, took a notebook and a pencil, and also brought a small novel that wasn't allowed in the classroom.</p>
<p>Hiding in the corner to read the novel, he didn't hear anything the teacher said. When he got tired of reading, he picked up the pencil and started drawing, making quick sketches of the girls sitting in the front row. Because of this, he thought of the unfinished love letter. Because of this, he hated that the clock was ticking too slowly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the teacher called him to the blackboard to do an algebra problem. He stood there</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>for a long time, unable to do it. The teacher lectured him.</p>
<p>"Damn it, if it's good, it's good, if not, please get out!" Sha wrote in his mind: "Why should I be scolded by you when I've paid the money?"</p>
<p>In the afternoon, he asked someone to get him leave. He spent an hour dressing himself up. He hurriedly took a car to the agreed-upon theater.</p>
<p>After coming out of the movie theater, he ate dinner at a Western restaurant.</p>
<p>Then he went to the Canidrome... then he went to the dance hall... when others were getting up to leave, he returned to school.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Definitions of Hakka Dialect in Guangdong - Zuo <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Taking provinces as the unit, the most complex language in China is probably Guangdong. Cantonese, Hakka, Hoklo (Chaoshan dialect), Qiongya dialect (Hainan dialect)...ah, there are so many! Not only are they very different from Mandarin, but even a single word or phrase is difficult for people from other provinces to understand. Sometimes, even we Cantonese people get confused. For example, Cantonese speakers say "eat rice" as "yeh faan," Hakka speakers say "shit faan," Hoklo speakers say "jieh faan." In terms of the four, there is a real difference. Cantonese has the greatest influence (the language of Cantonese people generally living in Shanghai), followed by Hakka, Hoklo, and Qiongya, which is closer to Cantonese. Here are some examples of Hakka dialects:</p>

<p>Act Three: Ode to Peace</p>
<p>Military Authorities: (Yawning) This is to say that the retreat of the troops fighting on the front lines must require a large amount of military pay to deal with them. Isn't this point still unresolved?</p>
<p>Political Authorities: Hmph! There is no way to deal with these things. Fighting costs money, and not fighting also costs money. Now transferring to the front line costs money, and retreating also costs money, but when a war breaks out, everyone is unwilling to go to the front and wants to maintain their strength. Isn't this too difficult for us?</p>
<p>Military Authorities: But there is no way around it. I think it's better to find the president of the chamber of commerce and them to discuss it and resolve it at a meeting.</p>
<p>Political Authorities: Find them? Then I think there is no way. In fact, they are probably unwilling to take out the money.</p>
<p>Military Authorities: Regardless of these. (Shouting inward) Secretary He, call them to come right away, one from the bank, one from the entrepreneur, and the president of the chamber of commerce. (Yawning) Let's go upstairs and lie down for a while. Recently, someone sent me twenty taels of the best foreign opium.</p>
<p>Political Authorities: Thank you! I have already eaten at home.</p>
<p>Military Authorities: Hey, why are you being so polite? Let's talk slowly in the den... Oh, Secretary He, that one I told you about... Who... Staff Officer Yu, you teach him to come too.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: (Voice) Which Staff Officer Yu, is it the uncle?</p>
<p>Military Authorities: Of course, is there any need to ask?</p>
<p>(Goes upstairs. At this time, the stage is empty. Only the voice of the confidential secretary making a phone call behind the velvet curtain. Soon after, a maid sticks her head out of the window under the balcony on the left and calls the groom.)</p>
<p>Maid: Hey! Hey!...Come here, come here...I want to talk to you. (The groom walks from the left to the window, holding her hand.)</p>
<p>Groom: What do you want to say to me? Do you want me to come in?</p>
<p>Maid: I want to talk to you about something serious, but you are being so sneaky again. In broad daylight, if you are bumped into, you can forget about eating here. Let me tell you, just now I was cleaning the master's opium bed inside and picked up a diamond. Didn't the mistress say that a small diamond had fallen off the ring? She searched everywhere, but couldn't find it. Look, now I picked it up, good luck, isn't it?</p>
<p>Groom: How could it fall on the bed?</p>
<p>Maid: Who knows how it happened. Maybe they were too happy on the bed, fighting like, how could it not fall off? (She took it to show him) Look, isn't it this small thing.</p>
<p>Groom: Oh! Dropped it!</p>
<p>Maid: Oh! You dead pig! If you don't find it for me, I will fight you.</p>
<p>Madam: (Comes down from upstairs) Secretary He!...Is Secretary He inside?</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: I'm here, (Comes out from behind the curtain) Madam! What's the matter?</p>
<p>Maid: Did you find it?</p>
<p>Madam: It's nothing, just chatting.</p>
