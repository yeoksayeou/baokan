<p>我國今日之國難。愈見緊急。外則日軍迫近長城。熱河淪没之後。灤東勢甚緊急。多倫張家口亦受威脅。彼關東軍參謀長小磯國昭近忽奉武藤命返日。其主要任務。固在籌商如何應付中東路問題。而急欲侵略張多亦已形跡顯露矣。内則匪共猖獗。自其老巢突出。思欲擴大其擾亂之區域。益以江西山川交錯。彼可出没無常。勇敢善戰之國軍。輒感應付不易。是以﹁安内攘外。﹂今確成爲特别重要之問題。孰先孰後。自應有一確切之决定。今蔣軍委會長巳明白宣示先安内後攘外之方策矣。一般將領。果能奮其勇氣。遵從蔣軍委會長之勗勉。先從事於﹁安内﹂之工作。於最短期内肅淸匪共。奠定一般秩序。使人民衣食有着。各安其業。軍事上無内顧之憂。則對日抗戰前途。自多補益。</p>
<p>我國原號稱以農立國。而農村衰落。乃年甚一年。在歐美各國。以其工業發達。又復開拓海外市塲。以工業消納其過剩人口。吸收農村遊離分子。始能勉强保持其社會之均衡。但自世界經濟恐慌爆發以還。内外市塲。同感狹小。失業羣衆。愈見增多。天産豐富如北美合衆國。幾窮於應付。精悍如德意志。乃至徒喚奔何。　預之日本。則以軍需品之不生産工業。剌激産業界之疲敝狀態。以消納過剩生産。我國在此環境中。惟一吸收農村過剩人口之方策。在粤閩諸省。爲赴海外作苦工。在内地爲當兵。一般近代都市所吸收後備工人。究竟數目有限。以是國力愈疲。國民經濟愈益衰頺。社會乃愈不安。同時城市工商業。因農村經濟之破敗。由根本動搖。幾至於不能維持。長此以往。眞將不堪設想。安内誠爲今日急要之問題也。</p>
<p>是故吾人希望當局安内於軍事之外。更注意下列二事。</p>
<p>第一爲國民生計之安定。我國多數人民。瀕於饑餓之險境。自繁華之大都市。迄於邊僻之村野。莫不餓莩載道。失業成羣。故安内之第一要着。須開闢人民求生之路。使人人皆得盡其才力。以維繫其生活。以其餘力貢獻於國家社會。旣已脫離農村生産之人。固不易使其再行歸農。（蓋因農業辛勤最甚即歸農亦恐無地可供耕種）然農村額外担負之應减免。苛捐雜稅之應革除。在今日巳萬不可再緩。至於調節農村經濟。使農民不受高利剥削。整理現有土地。使地盡其力。則偏枯之社會。始有生機。城市之繁榮。方有基礎。﹁安内﹂之計劃。乃可得而初步實行也。</p>
<p>第二。爲政治之開明。近數年來。積極之政治設施。殊未暇顧及。即消極應有之廉潔政治。亦成爲最高道德。是以政治的憂鬱時間多。而光明之希望少也。最低限之政治常軌。開明廉潔等。在歐美民主國家所已實現者應立即求其實現。我國幅員廣大。一時誠不易收指臂之效。設使能嚴選縣長。確立地方自治。則政治淸明。亦不難期其實現。</p>
<p>上述二者。雖甚簡略。然實爲當前﹁安内﹂之急務。蓋必須民生安定。政治開明。然後乃能收拾全國之人心。彌縫内外之禍患。理論上固當如是也。</p>

<p>﹁到前線採訪新聞去﹂丨</p>
<p>我就在這樣激昻慷慨的情緒裏、上了火車、别了親愛的上海、一列長蛇般的火車、衝着曉風晨霚前進了、妻子眼看着我是離開她、一點點的遠了、她眼圈立刻紅紅的、我知她内心是在酸楚、可是這樣的到前線去、你還難過嗎、你這個女人眞是個弱者、</p>
<p>鐵的輪盤在綠色的原野上奔馳着、從那些美麗的小村莊旁穿過去、我的頭緊緊的貼着車窗、望着四野的郊原、同時心裏在廻蕩着去年一二八時此地砲火時的情緒、但是我們那些鐵一般的民族勇士、和那些爲自衛戰而死的無名英雄、在這裏遺留下些什麽、血染過的戰壕、以及那敵人炸彈下的蜂巢、已經輕烟般的模糊渺茫了、在這少女般的春天懷抱裏、粉紅色的桃花、不是又依舊在這春風裏笑嗎、車過了黄渡、很快的到了靑陽港、在靑陽港的橋上、是給了我一個很短促而又痛心的廻憶、車慢慢的在鐵橋上爬過、望見了崑山和那　立着的塔身、時光的輪子已經把沉痛、慘苦、悲哀、的影子毁滅了、蘇州的塔和無錫的塔、都是無恙地在春風裏﹁立正﹂着、江南的美麗不是這樣的表現着嗎、鎭江的金山寺俯瞰着江中的帆影、黄土潮濕的崖上、仍是盤踞着那些苦力的小草屋、我看了這現實的天堂和地獄、我只有悶悶的坐下燃着了一枝香烟、用那裊裊的烟圈來模糊我自己的感傷、</p>
<p>在車窗裏望見了那雄巍莊嚴的南京城墻時、忽然温和的天空裏撒佈着輕靈的兩脚、踏着碧綠色的田隴、慢慢的奏着﹁春來不久﹂的調子、隴頭上新添過黄土的墳頭、蹲伏着黑白花相間的﹁喜鵲﹂、牠很自然的在大地上生存着、可是我看着這淸明後的嫩綠、北望故鄉烽火、在鐵蹄下的父老、那麽我只有鼻子上發酸了、</p>
<p>聯運的車在下午五時、一直開到南京江邊、許多過江的乘客、擁上了過江的輪船、南望獅子山、東望浪花滾滾的江流、這是大中華民國的國土、然而泊在江心中的外艦、很神氣的高舉着帝國主義的旗子、我們玩具似的小砲艦、牠那樣的渺小、在那龐大的外艦跟前臥着、但是靑天白日滿地紅的旗子、也在艦頭上招展着、</p>
<p>浦口的景象我覺着和日暮的情景差不多、票房裏照樣的睡着許多灰色的兵、冷淸淸的站上停着一列準備直開北平的藍色鋼車、憲兵和警察以及查票員、再加上零零落落的幾十個乘客、點綴着偌大的浦口車站、</p>
<p>紅卍字的救護隊有二十幾個人、也隨這列車北上、他們是在努力盡國民的義務、所以不留戀江南的春色、願意踏上抗日的大道、再進一步眞要丢下担架去拿槍桿、那麽中國能担保就亡嗎、我很倉促的没有詳細問明白他們是那裏來的、和什麽人發起組織的、但是我敢講一句、他們是中國人、他們認淸楚了國亡就在目前的重大性、他們憑着熱血和良心組織的、我心裏表示對他們致敬禮、</p>
<p>徐州仍然是被沙土包圍着、車站上的景象因爲是大早上的緣故、除了些着藍布棉褂子的小販以外、就是灰色的兵、很尖利的晨風在車站上吹着、田野裏的綠色和江南差不多、但那醉人的春風在這裏可找不到、不久車又向北方遼闊的平原飛躍了、</p>
<p>陽光很柔物的在大地上照着、平原上的田畝很整齊的擺着一塊塊綠絨般的麥田、遠處的山露着挺拔的雄姿、在淡烟似的雲影裏飛着、江南山的温柔的輪廓、在這裏是望不見的、整齊的村莊、以及那些充滿了古色古香的山東農人的臉、還有小脚的娘們、渾身穿着藍布衣服、脚上纏着粉紅色的帶子、在這些表現裏、山東人是時代輪盤下的偉大者呵、</p>
<p>我在車窗裏望着、彷彿是很關心這些山東老鄉親、我目擊現在這種飽食暖衣的情形、把前五六年、那些腦海裏對于山東啼飢失所的印象、一槪掃了個乾凈、尤其是車到了張夏車站、西面那美麗的山灣、成千成百家的房屋、雪白色的梨樹花、春風吹開的嫩柳、我眞有些留戀這美麗的張夏灣、何况那個山東人的茶房對我說道、﹁先生、這個地方眞好看、每年桃和梨出産的特别多、路局眞要拿出錢來建築一下、那麽有錢的人也可以來玩了﹂、他這樣說、我只有點點頭、承認他是說的對、三營屯附近被敵機炸毁之民房（中央社攝）</p>
<p>兗州的城墻照樣的一天殘缺下去一天、我們在十二點車進了站、不用說油烘烘的大燻鷄、在山東老鄉的嘴裏喊着、站那面有許多的兵、都脫去了上身軍衣、白色的汗褂、很整齊的大家一樣的白、在那裏塡築道路、紅黑的臉上流着汗珠、這　力的表現、我靠着木栅欄照了一張照、回過頭來向那站上的警察說、﹁這是誰的隊伍、這樣整齊﹂、﹁這是老韓的隊伍﹂、他回答的語氣裏帶着一種肯定的力量、好像别仔細看了看、在站上武裝的兵、衣服是好像很整齊、槍也不錯、多半是﹁捷克式﹂、每個兵的樣子是有些着人願意看的神氣、﹁好吧、這樣軍隊、的確還不錯、不怪宋哲元的大刀隊在喜峯口出風頭﹂、車開時我心裏這樣想着、</p>
<p>二十九軍傷兵陳金台曾用大刀殺敵數十人（中央社攝）</p>
<p>車到濟南是下午六點二十分、天氣立刻凉起來、一陣陣吹着凉風、的確在江南過慣了的人們、從暖烘烘的懷抱裏鑽出來、忽然碰到這般凉勁兒、眞有點發抖、我在車站上巡視了一遍、覺得這個建築還算不錯的濟南車站、在華北總能數得着了、最好的印象、車站附近没有一個閒雜的兵在徘徊、除了十幾個服勤務的兵、簡直左右看了半天、就没有找到、站台上也打掃的乾凈、什麽都很有秩序的、在車開了的時候、又在深思這個比較好的印象、</p>
<p>我坐的對面從濟南上來一位着西裝的朋友、他是濟南汽車公司裏的一個職員、那麽在閒談時、山東的老韓作了我們臨時談話的好材料、﹁韓乂乂在山東到底怎麽樣﹂、﹁還算得一個好人﹂他沉思了半天纔這樣的回答﹁聽說有許多的案子、他自己都要間過、差不多都不經過法院﹂、﹁没有法子老百姓打官司單願意到他那裏告嗎、他自己設立了一個老百姓告狀的屋子、老百姓一告就准、並且馬上出見、很快的就把事情解决、所以這樣一來、貪官惡覇、就不敢肆虐了、尤其對于抽白面吃雅片的、眞呌他槍斃了不少﹂、﹁他眞是不要錢的好官了﹂、﹁但是他本身不要錢、恐怕屬下趁着他打嗑睡時、要私自要錢吧、但他太厲害了、所以這種毛病也就不見﹂、</p>

<p>漢代整個石室</p>
<p>室内漢圖滿目</p>
<p>濟南快信、魯省近年迭次發現古物、漢畫石尤多、此次滕縣發現周代鼎　、省立圖書館長王獻唐、奉令前往調查、因游覽曹王墓、又發現漢代整個石室及漢畫石數千方、不但漢代畫石之種類及用途、可得考見、即漢代宫室建築形式亦可藉以參考研究、且漢代整個石室、尤爲歷來所未曾發現者、兹紀詳情如次、</p>
<p>省立圖書館館長王獻唐日前赴滕縣安上村調查發現之古物後、因聞安上村東有曹王墓、係滕邑古蹟、特往調查、無意中竟發現漢代石室、室内有漢代畫像、價值連城、據王獻唐談、安上村東去十里、有曹王墓、彷彿一小山、據土人云、山上有墳墓九十九座、惟據本人調查、發現者僅八座、墓之形狀、妙不可言、墓上有方口與地平、自口入、即見石室、四面皆有墻、墻各有門、門方形、爲屋一大間、其深或可見邊、或深不知其尺寸、屋上皆石板、撑以石柱、墓内所有石板皆爲漢代畫像、統計大小千餘塊、屋高七八尺、寛一丈左右、井口有石蓋、蓋有糟、中有鼻可提、羅文峪七十二烈士靈柩運至後方安葬（中央社攝）</p>
<p>土人相傳係曹操之父墓、但據本人考察、室内旣有漢畫像、可證爲漢代有人避亂所築、石室一幢、其口非門、乃石室之天牕、現雖發現八個、相信必有數十個、且石屋必互相貫聯、惜爲土埋耳、至石室之由來、大抵漢末時、天下大亂、兵燹遍野、時人爲避亂築此石室、其所以用石之故、蓋因該地自安上村至曹王墓十餘里間、皆爲山地、取石甚易、窮者以石築室、富者雕以石像、此次發現之石室、爲漢代完整者、爲歷代所未發現、其在文化史上之價值、洵不可以道里計、室内漢代畫像之價值、尤爲重大、歷來所發現漢代畫像雖多、但皆係斷片者、至何種畫像、用諸壁墻、何種用諸柱石、皆未能考實、此次石室發現後、則畫像種類及用途、皆得考出、同時漢代宫室建築形式、亦可考見、</p>
<p>石室畫像極多、雕刻精粗不一、且漢畫石遺棄地面及山上者、不可勝數、惜鄉愚不知、或以之建築房舍、或以之修築廟宇橋樑、殊深浩嘆、本人見此情形、已决予蒐集保存、保存之法、第一步先行淸山、以便調查井口（即石室天牕）確數、打通各石室相通地道、期整個石室完全出現、俾人入内游覽、并在井口建築小亭、以蔽風雨、第二步即搜集散失各處之漢代畫石、建室保存、以便各方人士參觀考察、至已經用以建築廟宇橋樑房舍者、則一一調查、勒令永遠保存、以上兩事、所費僅數千元、而古代遺産、可永久保存、本人已趕擬預算、呈請省府及敎育廳鑒核矣、（十一日）</p>

<p>今天讀了劉思民君的﹁對於﹁農村裏回得去嗎﹂的討論﹂後，我覺得劉君對於尤先生的見解有些誤會，所以不怕獻醜，寫成這篇，特地奉上，對於劉君的誤點，有所指正·（一）尤先生說：﹁久居城市中的人，或要感到枯寂無聊的少趣，然而我覺得在國難當頭的時節，眼見都市醉生夢死的生活，倒不如覓一個幽靜可愛的鄉村去另謀出路憑我能力所及，用十年的功夫，來建設一個意想中的﹁新式的桃花源﹂·這幾句話眞是洞達大勢，眼光深遠極了；當然，久居都市中的人，每感生活的煩擾，假使有機會到鄉村裏去，非但在生活上可以得到一種調劑，就是在身心上又未始無益，至於雄聲君與其在都市中感覺鲐生活的困難，不若到鄉村中去，生活比較容易解决，這一來，自然，雄聲君有回到鄉村裏去的必要。再講我國鄉村敎育的不發達，盡人皆知，因爲鄉村敎育的不發達的緣故，於是一般農民對於耕種上不曉得改良，講到國事更疏忽到極點，老實說，假使中國鄉村敎育發達的說話，那麽中國的農業早已興盛，而不像現在那麽的萎頓，雖然農業的破産由於内亂，但是工欲善其事必須利其器，生産量數的境加，還是靠着器皿的改良，器皿的改良，當然要靠身歷其境的農民。但是無智無識的農民，未曾受過敎育的農民，他們祗知一味守舊，對於器皿，種子，等等，又安知改良呢？同樣是一個人爲什麽歐美各國的農民對於器皿上種子上知道改良，而我國的農民反而不知道呢？這當然由於没有智識，所以没有智識顯而易見，由於農村敎育的不發達，在這裏我們可以看出農村敎育的重要了，那麽尤先生敎雄聲君回到鄉村裏去，非但使雄聲君的身心得到調劑，就是生活也便於解决，同時可以盡雄聲君的力，致力於開拓鄉村敎育，對於國家未始無益，一舉三得，何樂不爲？假若？思民君不敎雄聲君回去，試問另外運有别的出路嗎？再不然呌雄聲君流落異鄉，餓死不成？至於另找别的職業，老實說，在供多於求的上海，雄聲君恐怕一時還不能謀得揷足地哩！（二）﹁新式的桃花源﹂是一種意想中的建設，日本的侵略，共産的搗亂，是一種破壞，各趨絶端，假使你怕破壞，那你不要建設，但是破壞儘管破壞，建設還是要建設，世界上的人士，明知戰爭是破壞的，並且預料戰爭是不可避免的，照理爲避戰爭破壞建設起見，就不必從事於建設了，但是適得其反，環顧世界各國誰不努力從事於建設耶？假令照思民君看起來，必定要當他們發狂，但是他們並不發狂呀！丨丨那麽這又爲什麽呢？哪！哪！這就是說建設儘管建設，破壞管破壞，倘若建設了﹁新式的桃花源﹂而怕日本和共産的破壞，那猶之一個人旣生而怕死，人旣怕死，則不若不生，我說思民君假使你怕死的說話，則莫若不生。再說尤先生的所謂建設一個﹁新式的意想的桃花源﹂並不是說建設了﹁新式的桃花源﹂之後，對於國家大事，就可置之不顧，﹁不論周秦遑論中華民國﹂，殊不知建設﹁新式桃花源﹂的主要點，就是要使人民知道國家大事，因爲建設﹁新式桃花源﹂的出發點，就是想開拓農村敎育，所以要開拓農村敎育就是要使人民洞達國家大事爲最高目的，總而言之，此﹁新式的桃花源﹂不是陶濳先生意想中不問世事的﹁桃花源﹂，思民君對於這點還未觀透，卽加批評可謂滑稽之至（三）農村的破産，不僅僅於鄉村支配於城市，殊不知農村的破産，情形龐雜，牠們各有背長，譬如中國農村的破産由於内亂，共匪到處擾亂，然而設若中國而農村敎育發達的說話，那麽農村的破産，也不至於一敗塗地，誠然美國日本的鄉村敎育辦得比我們十百倍好，可是，思民君，試問美國日本農村的破産，其程度是否比我國厲害？假使我的觀察不錯的說話，那我想未必吧！（四）再說城市中的人，在大體講起來，的確比鄉村中的人民狡猾得多，不信，單就上海的黑幕而言，試問鄉村中有嗎？思敏君，你說﹁上海三百二十萬人中的大多數人，（店員工人一部分的靑年學生）他們都還是誠實不欺的，這話未必盡然，須知天下的事决無絶對的，你說鐵是冷的，然而被太陽是晒或是火裏鍊也有熱的一天，你說店員工人一部份的靑年學生他們還都是誠實無欺的話是靠不住的，因爲店員工人學生也有良秀之差别呀！</p>

<p>— 潘仰葊</p>
<p>學瑩姑娘，滿身洋貨，自負十分。</p>
<p>出入交際塲中，十分自負，</p>
<p>花枝招展般的往來，眉飛色舞；</p>
<p>驀地間遇到一個樸樸實實的鄉婦，</p>
<p>頭到脚的針線工夫，都由自做。</p>
<p>自己紡紗，自己織布，</p>
<p>家中的衣食住用，没有一件不是土貨。</p>
<p>土頭土腦，倒可以代表中國的主婦。</p>
<p>摩登姑娘，請你且慢笑他，且慢厭惡，</p>
<p>像你這樣推消洋貨，眞是不知亡國痛苦。</p>
<p>我們早已換了眼光，看見樸實婦女，</p>
<p>十分景仰，十分慶賀。</p>
<p>看見了你們妖妖怪怪的全身充滿了洋貨，</p>
<p>倒要當你們是十足的﹁商婦﹂，十二分的厭惡。</p>
<p>這是區區一首小時，每每逢到許多婦女不知不覺的念給她們，她們不但不來見怪，都說很有道理，爲什麽不在國貨週刊上發表出來，貢獻給一般主婦。</p>
<p>小姑娘，年紀大，要揀一個如意丈夫，</p>
<p>第一個條件，便是要服用國貨。</p>
<p>郎才女貌，固然要講究，</p>
<p>可是十足的公子哥兒，專銷洋貨，</p>
<p>任憑你媒人說長論短，東跑西步，</p>
<p>我愛國貨，决不嫁你這没良心的蠢貨。</p>
<p>這是區區的第二首小詩，每每逢到一般小姑娘，不知不覺的念給她們，她們都點點頭笑將起來，也催促我拿來發表。恰好本刊出一﹁婦女與國貨專號﹂，要做一篇開場白，我没有工夫做文章，就拿來充數罷。</p>
<h3 id="c211">一個新條件 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 白羽</p>
<p>丨請將要定婚的小姐們注意丨</p>
<p>自﹁父母之命媒妁之言﹂的婚姻制度演化爲最近的須得當事人同意的婚姻制度，不可不說是現代靑年的幸福，最近的婚姻制度的一個特微，就是在訂婚前，無論是男子或是小姐，他們都有幾個選擇配偶的條件存於心中。這種選擇配偶的條件很多，如性情，學識，能力，健康，志趣，容貌，經濟等等，有許多專家，不惜化費許多精力去從事調查和研究。就我所　到和所聽到的現代靑年的選擇配偶的條件中，還有一點不曾注意到，讀者試猜想一下，是甚麽條件，我這篇文字發表在國貨週刊上，聰明的讀者當然就全知道一選擇配偶的條件，要加上一條愛用國貨的條件﹂不錯，我的意見的確是如此，就是﹁愛用國貨﹂是選擇配偶的一個條件，而且是一個重要的條件，爲甚麽呢？聽我道來。</p>
<p>國難如此之嚴重，民生如此之窮困，提倡國貨雖不是起死回生的仙藥，然而至少可以杜塞以些漏巵，培養一些國富，與强隣一些少許的打擊，爲民生稍謀一線的生機。居今日而否認提倡國貨之價值與必要者，必無血氣，必無心肝。然而嘴中說着國貨應當提倡，實際上郤拼命的爲洋貨作義務推銷員者很多。尤其是一般未婚的男子，以服用外貨爲時髦，爲闊綽，爲表示其經濟能力的充裕。但是當你向他國貨應否提倡，他又二十四分的贊成提倡。這樣言行矛盾的人，他的說話都爲虚僞的，都是欺騙的，對於提倡國貨這一件事是如此，對於其他各事也是如此，你看他滿口的愛你，滿口的願意做你的奴隸，都是虚僞的，都是欺騙的，他能有勇氣主張國貨不應當提倡，那麽，他服用洋貨，食用洋貨，這種人纔是擔　起責任的男子，他旣然承認國貨應當提倡，而又惟洋貨之是求，這就足以證明他的虚僞，證明他的欺騙，你將一顆處女純潔的心，貢獻給一個虚僞欺騙的男子，是何等的危險啊！一個崇拜洋貨的男子，若爲擺闊而購用洋貨，若爲趨時而購用洋貨，若爲炫耀於你而購用洋貨，其情可恨，其心可誅，你更不可以受他的誘惑，受他的欺罔。所以，你在他的一切都適合了你的選擇配偶標準的時候，還得也注意他是不是一位言行相符愛護國家的男兒，而後再决定你的從違。</p>
<p>眞正的愛用國貨，固然可以證明他是一位眞實的愛國男兒，而且將來在組織家庭的時候，家庭的經濟上要省郤許多無謂的浪費，你們的家庭，决不會因奢侈而發生經濟勤搖，也不會因奢侈而使得家庭破産，同時，國民的經濟，也并不會因爲你們的結婚而受到損失，小姐們，這一個選擇配偶的條件，其重要實不讓性情，學識，能力，健康，志趣，容貌，經濟等等的條件啊。</p>
<h3 id="c212">對於國貨的小建議 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 藹澄女士</p>
<p>我是個中等家庭的主婦，丈夫在敎育界服務，靠着薪水養活全家，一家七口，四季衣服都我一手經管，每逢添購新衣，對於衣料，頗費周章，童子當然用國貨，就是我和丈夫，也喜歡用國貨。可是什麽是國貨？什麽是洋貨？不容易辨别明白，有時自己以爲國貨，店員</p>
<p>也說是國貨，拿回家來，問問人家，偏又說是洋貨，一團高興，冷水澆頭，再難過也没有了。所以第一個建議，是希望國貨指導所或中華國貨産銷協會，编一本國貨指南，做我今後購買國貨的導師。國貲顔色往往不甚合時，價格又比洋貨相等的東西貴些，爲了經濟關係，忍痛購買洋貨的婦女，不在少數，所以第二個建議，是希望國貨廠家研究染色及製造，並削低貨價，採取薄利多賣主義。國貨敎育要深深地印入子女腦海裏，這個責任，凡是主婦，都應當負的。不但要敎子女服用國貨，並且要使子女明白什麽是國貨，和爲什麽要用國貨，養成服用國貨的良習慣。這是推行國貨的基本工作，所以第三個建議是希望國貨界多編些關於國貨的圖畫和故事，婦女上門購買國貨，隨時贈送，實在是最有效力的廣告。上面三個建議，雖無甚高論，却實易行，熱心提倡國貨人們，似乎值得注意和研究一下吧。</p>
<h3 id="c213">约法三章 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 晚霞女士</p>
<p>男子們旣這樣麻木不仁，我尤要鼓動我們的勇氣。我們如在未嫁的時候，應該在訂婚時，提出一個極重要的條件，約法三章，即彼此不用外貨如一方違犯，得提出離異或處罰，都在這條件上寫得明明白白。</p>
<p>如己結婚的，那就用嚴厲的勸告，併精密的監視。</p>
<p>至於家用的一切，完全要由於我們購辦，不要經他們過手，這不過購買時也要精細考察，牌號，廠名，原料，來源，在可疑時也要到製造處所檢查一下，就不至受愚了，因爲奸商多得很哩。</p>
<p>假使偶然由他們買了一件非國貨回來，我們就鐵面無情地挪這件非國貨破壞得紛紛碎碎，或竟絶交二三小時，這樣一來，他下次就不再犯了，不過須要神氣十足，抱定一個懲一儆百的意思，那就可一勞而永逸了，不如此則天天吵閙，他仍舊天天要犯的，這種心理學，一定要明白。</p>
<p>一個男子終要配一個女子的，一個家庭，没有婦人就不成。提倡國貨這個重責，不都在我們身上嗎？反之破壞國貨，提倡外貨，也是我們重大的罪惡。</p>
<p>諸姑姊妹們，就從今天爲始，快快起來負這個極重大的提倡國貨的責，萬不要做民國的罪人。</p>

<p>昔年曾辦﹁小俠客﹂三日刊，請舊友趙晋卿先生題詞，時趙先生任工商部駐滬辦事處處長，渠謂報紙代表輿論，有指導社會之責，須具有孟老夫子所說富貴不淫，貧賤不移，威武不屈之眞精神，乃能秉筆直書，無愧天職。說文以權方輔人至公無私曰俠，故俠客行爲，往往扶弱抑强，以抱不平，貴報命名小俠客，表示爲民喉舌，不畏强禦，即先總理所謂大無畏精神，除　管以書﹁具大無畏精神以嗚不平﹂十字外，并謂近來</p>

<p>— 朱王浣靑</p>
<p>﹁商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花。﹂在酒綠燈紅金迷紙醉的上海，一若歌舞昇平，雖志士大有人在，可是三數無錢無鐵的老百姓，有什麽用途？然而民國到底是國民的，不是官僚政客土豪奸商的，所以我們不要看着嘆着，要各個人從自身切實做起。節衣縮食，勤儉耐勞，來做東北健兒們的後盾。雖然說是救國，實在就是自救。也是爲了子孫後輩留些餘地。所謂皮之不存，毛將焉附？試問託庇於鐵蹄下的同胞們，有否感受到亡國的痛苦？我們不能拿着鋼刀，携着炸彈，將倭奴殺個痛快，收復失地，可是最容易做的事，爲什麽放着不幹，而去學那歌舞於漏舟中的情况？可嘆亦復可憐！我以爲根本救國唯一的目的，就是改進家庭，敎育兒女，納諸正軌，若是一個主婦，能治家有方，有條不紊，敎育子女成了健全的公民，復没有絲毫利巳欺人的行爲。腐化的現象，感化自己兒女親友鄰舍僕役不買洋貨，更不買仇貨。若是一個家庭還看見有仇貨在那裏使用，我們就輕看她的人格，不與往來。因爲這種人根本是奴性，可以說是非人類的。我們婦女快起來，對内改進家庭，敎育子女，對外抵制仇貨，提倡國貨，這就是我們婦女唯一根本救國的責任，末了我們喊着一句口號；</p>
<p>﹁婦女們唯一的責任，是服用國貨。﹂</p>
<p>外貨充斥，購用者婦女較男子更多，婦女之中，而以好出鳳頭之妓女爲尤甚，若不力圖補救，利權外溢，國　民貧，皆由於此。小報中對於北里中人之新聞，較大報詳畫，貴報第二期登有﹁北里中之俠客﹂一文，可見小俠客亦不忘北里中，願以後對於北里中喜用國貨者，詳加注意，表而出之，則良家婦女知北里中尚有愛用國貨排斥外貨之熱心同胞，良心發現，改用國貨，亦未始非提倡國貨之一法云云。用意深遠，殊堪欽佩。平心而論，四萬萬同胞，男女參半，對於提倡國貨，雖應共同努力，但婦女界能熱心提倡，其前量確在男子之上。藍近數年來，外貨日增，衣食住行四大要素中，被其包括殆盡，式巧價廉，門類繁多，花樣百出，令人目迷五色，婦女本人所穿之衣料，以及購與兒女之服裝食物无具，與日常所用之化妝品等，巳佔大部份。且男子所服之衣料，以及家内一切雜物，大都由女子採辦，全國女子苟能鑒於强鄰壓境，國難臨頭，自今年國貨年起，下一大决心，無論衣食住行各種物品，不爲時髦二字所引誘，</p>
<h3 id="c216">提倡國貨要從婦女起 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 白雪女士</p>
<p>﹁婦女是人類的母親，所以提倡國貨要從婦女起。﹂</p>
<p>這是剛才看報的時候父親對我說的。</p>
<p>不錯，婦女永遠是人類的母親，負敎育子女的責任丨廣義的說法就是敎育人類的責任。　　况且婦女主持一切家政，如家中要添製新衣購備雜物等，都是由婦女提出要買什麽什麽，再交給男子（或婦女自己或男女雙方）去辦妥的：因爲男子差不多鎭天在外工作，不大會管到家事。所以婦女是家庭中最重要的人了。</p>
<p>尤其是子女，更須做母親的敎導他們，使他們養成愛用國貨的習慣。要養成愛用國貨的習慣，首先要有良好的國貨環境；要建設這個國貨環境，必須家庭中一切衣用器物，都要是完全國貨。</p>
<p>如男子要買洋貨，婦女應當加以勸阻，男子無不聽從的。但是婦女要買洋貨，男子多半是依從的；就是勸阻也生效極微，這是婦女們應當革除的劣點。</p>
<p>婦女們記着吧：婦女是人類的母親，提倡國貨要從婦女起！</p>
<p>摒棄外貨，槪購國貨，則雖有奸商貪圖厚利，暗中販賣劣貨，因無人光顧，結果亦必改營國貨，則各國貨工廠因銷路廣闊，勢必精益求精，出貨增多，價格低廉，國内商業與社會經濟狀况，自必逐漸發展。我國婦女界好用舶來品者，以上海爲最甚，都市次之，鄉村又次之，推其故，確爲時髦二字所害。上海五方雜處，外貨雲集，娼妓之多，甲於全國，娼妓因營業關係，咸爭奇鬭勝，選擇舶來品以裝飾，祗求鮮艶觸目，而能吸引登徒子之目光，不問利權外溢，而受人經濟侵略。一般姨太太與摩登女子，羡其美麗，不計金錢來源，相率效尤，花枝招展，養成習慣，甚至小家碧玉，亦竭力模仿，幾乎非用舶來品，即爲不時髦，風氣早開之都市，亦相習成風。金錢外溢，日甚一日，國貨銷路，遂一落千丈，苟智識階級之女同胞，能以身作則，抵制外貨，改用國貨，人人以用外貨爲可恥，用國貨爲時髦，未始不能移風易俗。希望上海女子乘此國難臨頭，積極進行，共同奮鬥，以爲全國婦女界倡。</p>

<p>— 浦曼彬</p>
<p>檢查一下　吾與外子空的時候，常常把家中和各人身上衣食住用的物件，仔細的檢查一下，有没有非國貨的？常見小孩用的畫圖釘和釘書用的蜈蚣釘，還没有國産品；一天無意中在交大展覽會中，看見山西壬申製造廠，有這項出品，爲之大快。</p>
<p>父母作則　家中小孩子，都是富有摩仿性，看見父母怎樣，他便怎樣。這幾年來家中有慣了國貨，小孩子個個都歡喜國貨了。有一次把阿銓十年前穿過的一件洋布衫，給阿維去穿，阿維哭起來了，她說：父親，母親，阿哥，都穿的國貨衣服，難道我獨不要愛國嗎？到底脫了下來，纔是快樂。有一天她當了中國國貨公司兒童市的副市長，替她穿了一件新衣，她暗暗地去問隔隣的許師母道，這件是純粹國貨嗎？回答她是，纔是放心。</p>
<p>交換條件　一次胥仰南先生嫁小姐，請任之先生證婚，任之先生說如果新夫婦都是用國貨，吾當然樂於一做。這也國貨年中的佳話。吾勸外子，以後也可同樣的作爲交換條件。乃至委託介紹職業的，也要定出一個辦法，非服用國貨的，請勿光顧。</p>
<p>討厭文章　國貨年中，最多的是提倡國貨文章，洋洋灑灑，滿紙空話，眞正討厭，吾說與其說空話，不如埋頭去實做。吾這次回鄉掃墓，路上遇見一個販劣布的人，在鄉村中活動，吾和外子把他大駡一頓，許多鄉下人，倒有些是非心，都說這個人專販東洋布，該駡該駡。結果把這混帳東西，抱頭鼠竄。　　頂眞傭人　一天傭人買了三匣瑞典自來火，吾把她責備了一下，一定呌她換了國貨纔罷。人家說吾太頂眞，吾說一次鬆了，下次又要買進外貨。</p>
<h3 id="c218">婦女服用國貨的認識問題 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 金頌唐</p>
<p>當這提倡服用國貨之聲甚囂塵上，國貨界諸君子鼓吹工作，不遺餘力，確在力求猛進之中。惟細考我國婦女對於國貨之服用與認識，實在尚在幼穉時代，推其故，原因甚多，不克縷述，兹將管見所及者，謹供獻於國貨生産界之前，以備高明之採納和改進：</p>
<p>﹁智力未充與敎育未普及﹂我國人口號稱四萬萬，當然半數是女子，大家知道敎育部的統計，未受敎育者，佔百份之八十以上，可知人民之受過敎育者，僅十之二。且中國重男輕女之積習，至今未寰，故女子之得受相當敎育者，實佔絶對少數。當仇貨傾銷政策猛晉時期，充斥市塲，改頭換面，狡計多端，有識之士，尚易被其濛混，况婦女界意識薄弱，但知價值低廉，無從認識此假面具之外貨乎？故敎育之普及，當爲婦女認識國貨之發軔。</p>
<p>﹁常識缺乏﹂智力已不充足，常識當然更形缺乏矣，我國女子素重禮敎，大半杜門不出，殊不知社會爲何物，遠論其他。近年以來，高呼社交公開，提倡女子職業，但男子失業者，比比皆是，女子有相當職業者，實滄海之一粟。社會接觸已少見聞，當然常識不廣，何能不受外貨之愚，故國貨商標之簡明深刻，亦屬婦女鑒别認識上之一端也。</p>
<p>﹁消費力强﹂當此經濟潮流，日見澎湃，人類消費，日趨奢華，加以歐風美雨，不斷輸來，物質愈文明，生活愈複雜。即以滬埠而論，婦女界之日常用品以及衣帽襪衫之類，新陳代謝，變化無窮，爭奇鬥勝，舶來品實居多數，試問國産能有幾何？雖云婦女界虚榮心之表</p>
<h3 id="c219">一位賢良的主婦 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 泉</p>
<p>主婦是家庭的主持者，她是社會經濟的主要消費者，同時她也是養育兒童提携後進的主人翁，所以無　從理論上說，或者從實際上說，一個賢良的主婦，都應該積極負起提倡國貨的職責。</p>
<p>這裏便是一位值得做賢良主婦的王女士，提倡國貨的事實。</p>
<p>在每次添置家用什物之前，王女士必和良人商議預算，第一是怎樣可最合經濟，第二是她誠懇和婉地請求他去買國貨，她良人本來也是位熱血愛國的靑年，這樣一來，更其增加了他購用國貨的决心。</p>
<p>每逢星期日或公共假期，王女士的良人可以得到一個休息的機會，王女士便和他領了兒女們常常到國貨陳列館去參觀，或者到國貨公司去添置雜物，在她的意思，這樣一來可免去她的良人在别處胡調，浪費金錢，二則可給兒童們一些服用國貨的信仰。</p>
<p>親戚李先生整備結婚了，送來一份請帖，王女士便請丈夫到國貨公司出一張禮劵　去。</p>
<p>示，實國産品之花樣寥寥，缺乏替代，加以工作製造之未精，不足引人入勝，實亦認識用上之一大阻力也。</p>
<p>自中國國貨公司開幕以來，民衆得一正確的認識，因國産品集合於處，便利於購買者，實非淺鮮，作爲普及婦女認識計，雖一紙商標之微，亦當加以研究，務使簡明化，通俗化，其他式樣之奇異，工作之精美，售價之低廉，迎合民衆的需要和婦女的心理，均屬至關重要者也。</p>
<h3 id="c220">從她說到國貨 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 盧偉池女士</p>
<p>說到服用國貨，不禁令我憶起數年前在南洋所看見的她，她是個東洋的婦人，也是僑居安南埠的，住在我家隔壁，她平日身上所穿的衣服，當然是用她本國貨，至於食的方面，多是用她本國出産的罐頭品，尤其是起初最令我莫名其妙的就是她到各布莊裏搜買許多木箱子丨封放東洋布的木箱子，原來她拿來燒飯時作木柴用，她們家庭日常的用品，甚至微小的東西，盡是用自己的國貨，一些都不使利權外溢，她們這種愛國的熱忱，眞值得人們的欽佩呀丨他們國家所以有這樣的富强，也因爲他們的婦孺對於選用國貨早有了認識和决心，唉！說到我們貴國就慚愧極了！帝國主義間的衝突，對華的侵略，全都是爲着爭奪解决生産過剩的消費市塲！中國，可憐我們中國的人民，還在淘醉舶來品，崇拜外貨的謬誤觀念還不曾打破，這樣下去，中國國貨的前途，當然無疑的要没落失敗，那有振興擴展的希望呢？</p>
<p>我以爲服用國貨是國民應有的美德，提倡國貨是國民應負的責任，爲圖謀國家的富强計，不能不要提倡國貨的運動，提倡國貨的運動，應由婦女們入手，因爲婦女就是家庭中的主婦，對於整個家庭的一切日常用品，都有選用的權力，如果中國的婦女們都能效法那位東洋的婦人，對於國貨信仰心建樹了基礎，料想國貨的前途大自展望，不但如此，而婦女們在家庭敎育中，佔有重要位置，平日還能在兒童面前，盡力宣傳國貨如何的好，國民應該怎樣的去用國貨，給他們小腦海裏先存有一種愛用國貨的良好觀念，種下堅定國貨的信仰心，　　親愛的姊妹們，國貨對於我們旣有這樣密切的關係，那我們應該要趕快起來，負起我們重大的使命，作提倡國貨的運動，盡力宣揚中華的國光，發展國貨的出路，（三，三十一，於曁南大學女宿舍。）</p>

<p>中華民國二十二年被認爲國貨年，在這一年中，我們要建樹國貨的信譽，更要確認國貨的信仰心，希望從都市推到鄉村，完成這項重大的使命。在這偉大的國貨運動中，恰巧我們的國貨週刊誕生，所以，我們更加興奮的呐喊。</p>
<p>這自許不能自矜爲自己的力量，但是，上海的婦女國貨運動却是由仰葊先生的﹁主婦的責任﹂所啓發的，因爲事實如此，我們也不能否認。</p>
<p>朱王浣靑女士是努力家庭運動的先覺，談過﹁主婦的責任﹂以後，想起了停頓已久的﹁家庭日新會﹂和﹁家庭改進會﹂，遇到潘先生的時候，便談到婦女國貨運動的實際工作，想把這比較有意義的事件實現起來。</p>
<p>經過了籌備會的計劃，决定召集一個家庭聯誼會；聯絡若干前進的主婦們，以身作則的從事實際工作，以勝於雄辯和宣傳的事實，喚起我婦女界，共同努力。</p>
<p>第一次會議是在尚賢堂開的，到會的人數出於預料之外，在許多的演說和討論以後，决定實施辦法四項。關於會塲情形和記錄，各報業已刊載，但是，最使我不能忘記的，敎育界先進七十老翁沈信鄉先生這天也曾觀自參加，對於國貨運動之熱心，并不在少年人之下，而這種精神是我們少年人足以欽佩而以爲楷模的。</p>
<p>第二次的會議是在普育社幼稚園舉行，到會的完全是婦女，坐在矮矮的椅上，仍舊是很熱心的討論，葛成慧女士往演說﹁國貨年婦女的責任﹂，熱烈情緒，不在第一次開會之下。</p>
<p>當然，這祇是開端，仍不能完全認爲實現，但是，如果大家能夠努力，能夠從自己做起，未來的光明，建設若干的國貨家庭，是我們所熱烈的希望的。</p>

<p>— 壽松</p>
<p>在這國難嚴重與國貨運動的聲浪喧囂一時的時候，無錫的國貨運動，當然也盛極一時，據記者觀察無錫婦女對於國貨的認識，有以下兩種不同的趨勢：</p>
<p>生産的　屬於這一類的婦女，究竟佔多數；她們終日埋首在工廠和家庭裏，加速度的進行着她們的生産，工廠裏的婦女們，大都利用她們的雙手雙脚來運用機器，每天所得，可以維持生活而有餘；家庭裏的，大都做她們的手工花邊業，所入也頗有可觀；以上所言，雖都是從事國貨生産，但實際上還是爲生活所驅使，對於國貨的本身，並没有深切的明瞭和認識；至於她們所服用的，確是道地的國貨。</p>
<p>消費的　屬於這一類的，是少數的﹁有閒階級﹂，她們所服用的，連她們自己也不能確切地認識是國貨抑是洋貨，總之，只求其﹁時髦﹂，﹁觸目﹂，﹁動人﹂﹁······﹂，至於何謂國貨？爲什　麽要服用國貨？却無暇顧問！</p>
<p>此外在商界方面，有女子國貨商店等，可是效率終究很少，欲其推而廣之，恐怕還有待於大規模的宣傳呢！</p>
<h3 id="c223">聰明的主婦如何選擇衣料 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 葉紹銘</p>
<p>人生四大要需，衣是第一項。衣爲障身之具，且爲衛生起見，不可不注意，是任何人都知道的了，但是我們所要研究的，尤其是婦女的衣着，究竟用那一種材料來做衣，是最經濟，最美觀，最合衛生？</p>
<p>一般主張儉樸的人，都說；只有布最好，價錢便宜，形式樸實，又可常洗，保持整潔，而合衛生。</p>
<p>但是。我們曾得到一個經騐，却知道用綢緞做衣服，實比布爲經濟而合算。在我們的祖父時代，開啟箱子來看，往往有許多綢衣，是他的父親，或者是他的祖父，所傳給他的，而我們的祖父，承襲了這份遺産，不但可以自己享用穿着，還可以把牠改小而給他的兒子孫子做小衣服穿。這是一件　實，我在八九歲的時候，確還穿過祖父遺下來的綢衣，改製了在新年裏穿着到親戚人家去賀年咧。</p>
<p>我們至少可以明瞭綢衣實在是比布衣耐穿。綢因爲是絲製，當然比棉纱堅固，而壽命長久，布衣因爲容易弄髒，所以必須常洗，常洗則易破；並且因爲是布衣的緣故，在穿着，時候，便不十分愛惜，格外容易汚損。惟有穿了綢衣，必特别注意，不便汚損。並且絲織品上，比較的不如布的容易染　汚，當然不必洗，或無庸常洗，不洗或不常洗，便比較的不容易破，據有經騐的主婦告訴我們，一件綢衣的壽命，大槪可以抵到三件，或四件布衣的壽命；洋貨綢緞或人絲織造的綢緞，這當然是例外。</p>
<p>衣服的美麗與整潔，關於人的興趣或同情，是很重要，尤其是婦女，假使粗頭亂服，旣失美觀，又减樂趣，所以我爲婦女的衣服最好用綢製；至其價格是否奢費，及於衛生是否適宜，也是很明瞭的。</p>
<p>綢衣一件，旣可抵布衣三四件的壽命，那麽我們假定製布衣四件，衣料價爲四元五角，工價爲四元，則需八元半；而綢價因只一件，故料價只需四元，工價只需二元，共只需六元半，這不是穿綢衣反比布衣便宜麽？</p>
<p>至於講到衛生，絲織品在氣候的變換中，比棉織品不容易受突殊的剌激到體膚，是任何人都有此經騐，所以綢衣也比布衣好。</p>
<p>近來洋貨充斥，中産階級以下的人，都購洋布或人造絲交織品裁製衣裳，中産階級以上的人，都購從來絲織品價錢非常昂貴，並且極不堅實，每年的漏扈極大。</p>
<p>今年是國貨年，大家提倡國貨，有許多人以爲要買國貨衣料，只有國産的布疋。但是一般愛美的婦女，又病國産的布，種類太少，花樣染色，也比較的不及洋布爲多，所以迫於提倡國貨的興論，不得已而也買些國産布疋做衣裳，但是還不曾怎却走上百貨公司去剪舶來品的綢緞。</p>
<p>實際上，她們不曾留意到國産的綢廠，近年來也很發達，種類也很多，花樣染色，也層出不窮，與舶來品全無二致，並且價格比舶來品要便宜到十分之五到十分之七咧。我們只要走進各國貨公司或綢緞商店去參觀一下，如美亞織綢緞廠的糺縵綢，凝香錦，錦　縐，格子雙縐，柳條雙縐，喬其紗，樣樣　很物美而價廉，完全是現代婦女美麗的衣料。</p>
<p>我們不要迷信洋貨，長他的人志氣；也不要不加思索去買次等的衣料。應該仔細考慮，是國産的，是經濟的，是美觀的是合乎衛生的，才可以買。</p>
<p>有經騐的主婦，大槪是都知道的：﹁衣不差寸鞋不差分，﹂稍有不經濟，便耗損於無形，而一家一年的累計，便不可勝算了。</p>
<p>做婦女的，不必諱言需要裝飾，只要合乎經濟條件下的裝飾，是何樂而不爲，倘然爲裝飾而耗金錢，替洋貨暢銷，那是聰明而愛國的女子，所不屑做，不　做的。</p>
<p>至於講到孩子的服裝，和丈去的服裝，大槪也由主婦所支配。我們也希望主婦好好地打算一下，究竟　買國産靈緞給丈夫裁製，或是用自已或丈夫穿舊的綢衣改製給孩子，　當由聰明的主婦主去斟酌。有時一件綢衣穿舊了，覆染一二次改製了再穿，是極平常的事；並且穿在身上，也還是很整齊而美觀的呢。</p>

<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>這或許是好現象吧！在國貨年中的第一季和第二季的開始，對於國貨，有這樣的成績，貢獻出來，這是多麽值得慶幸的事。</p>
<p>在二月裏，松江縣的各民敎中心機關，遵照敎育局訓令，舉行一次國貨巡廻宣傳以後，着實有一些成績。所以他們更覺得非舉辦巡廻展覽不可。在宣傳方面說，是要使民衆知道愛用國貨之重要·在展覽方面說，是要使民衆有認識國貨的機會。他們很决心的在二月五日，聚集各館館長，籌商進行。由中華國貨指導所和他們合作，他們當然很快活，可以如願以償了。</p>
<p>經過幾度的接洽和幾次的會議，在中華國貨指導所領導之下的松江縣國貨展覽會，四月九日在民衆敎育館開幕了。</p>
<p>會塲的屋子，在展覽會中要算是上等了。計分樓上樓下二處，屋子共二十問：樓下丨一·一心牙刷廠，二·中華琺瑯廠，三·大中華賽珞璐廠，四·仁昌永料器廠，五·華福製帽廠，六·三星棉鐵廠，七·家庭工業社，八·九·中國國貨公司，一○·中國化學工業社，樓上！一一·華昌鋼精廠，裕泰熱水瓶廠，一二·一三·鴻新染織廠，一四·華生電器廠，國華電池廠，一五·德新織綢廠，一六·五和織造廠，一七·五卅襪廠，一八·一九·二○·三友實業社，</p>
<p>各廠都鈎心鬥角，出奇制勝的張貼着不少動人的廣告，把松江人吸引得很多很多的前來觀光。</p>
<p>那天潘仰堯先生也到松江去參加開幕典禮，我爲了公司的任務，也同車到松江。上午九時前，松江的各機關代表，都紛紛到齊，而一般民衆，也大家都來要買見所未見的國貨。但是因爲開市要在下午一時，門警阻止了他們，他們覺得很懊悶，這可見﹁國貨﹂的效力！</p>
<p>振鈴開會，依照儀式下去。要推潘先生的演說最能使人警惕和引人發笑呢？他的演詞大意是這樣：﹁·········提倡國貨，是各人的責任。·····一天，我到虹口公園，看見一設日本人，席地而坐，他們在休息着，細看他們吃的用的，没有一樣不是日本自己的貨物，德國人也是一樣，他們告誡自己子弟，你們用的一針一線，也都要用本國的貨品。··········我以爲提倡國貨，要算女人的效力最大了。假如一位少女有了她的情人，情人喜歡服用外貨，她可以决絶地和他說，你如服用外貨，我不和你結婚。丨丨這時臺下的參與者，都笑了起來，同時鼓掌。而一般女學生，大都是臉龐兒暈上紅潮了。丨還有婦人們的丈夫，喜歡服用外貨，勸解不從時，可以提出離婚，丨丨臺下和以前一樣的鼓掌丨丨我想這樣地幹起來，那國貨纔能眞眞普及了！·········﹂</p>
<p>後來潘先生介紹了他的老師陸君來演說，也很中肯帶着些滑稽意味，聽他語氣，大有陶知行的風度呢！</p>
<p>最後，還攝了一影，把我也留了進去，這倒是個永久的紀念呢！</p>
<p>在這短促的會期中，丨四月九日至二十二日丨松江的民衆，大可乘此難得的機會去參觀和選購。關於衣的方面，有：三友·鴻新·三星·德新······等家的各種布疋絲綢。還有五和的汗衫，春秋衫。華福製帽廠的呢帽，五卅的襪子。日用方面有中國國貨公司的：﹁文具﹂和﹁玩具﹂，丨因爲他們部分至多，數不勝數，所以討論了兒童敎育的工具。丨中國化業工業社的觀音粉，醬油精，三星牙膏，各種香品，素皂，家庭工業社的各種香品及雪恥粉。華昌的鋼精用品，中華的琺瑯器皿，裕泰的熱水瓶，大中華的賽珞璐玩具······等，各有精到之處，就價格方面說，實在便宜得最低格了。</p>
<p>他們還要到附近鄉間去化裝宣傳，並且將各廠的出品，也帶些去讓誠樸淳厚的鄉下父老們，也能夠得到認識國貨的機會。我希望同樣的動作，不要限於，松江一處，而要把它流行到各省各縣各鎭各鄉，那絶成爲眞眞的國貨年的偉大工作呢！</p>
<h3 id="c225">所望於主婦們者 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 周成勛</p>
<p>﹁現代的主婦，必得認淸目標，本身是處在一個重要的地位，不僅僅乎三從四德的做了一個相夫敎子的賢妻良母算已完了責任，應該踏進社會，和社會打成一片，共負起國貨救國的担子！﹂我在寫本文之前，先得拿這段話忠實的獻給一般主婦們。</p>
<p>因爲社會的大部是多數家庭的集合，家庭是物質消費的大出路，而主婦們却是司理家政的主宰。</p>
<p>以過去那種情形看來，主婦對於國貨很可武斷說没有充分認識的，日常不可或缺的衣食享用，祇要花式合意價目上算，就不再高興去計較國貨非國貨，丈夫歡天喜地的買了來路貨回來，或者替孩子們添了一兩樣洋貨的玩具，更没有心思去審查是否國貨了！以致畫錦里畔，三公司裏，熙來攘往，努力替洋貨做一個義務的推銷員，眞是言之寒心。　　這不能不歸罪於從前社會上一般提高嗓子喊﹁提倡國貨﹂的大人先生，健忘了自己家裏和羣衆家裏的主婦們，使主婦們永永和社會隔離，因之提倡儘是提倡，洋貨依然有着忠誠的服用者，這矛盾可驚的現象一直到現在。</p>
<p>差幸近來的國貨趨勢，漸漸和婦女們走近，一部份婦女，很不甘人後的注意起國貨來，但是，單憑高調理論不着邊際的提倡，是没有成效的，主婦們該先檢束起自己本位上的資任，這就是說：家庭裏頭衣食住行一切用具器皿，以及酬酢交際往來消耗的物品，先來一下决心﹁非國貨莫辦﹂，甚至半絲半縷，一鞋一巾之微，也要抱有﹁誓用國貨﹂的志願才興，　次，對於丈夫購採物件的督策，及馴示孩子們服用國貨的精神，也是主婦們當前的急務！</p>
<p>但是，婦女們没有整個研究整個參酌的團體丨各自爲政的去實行，總覺得太無系统的，最好能夠組合起幾個會社，對於婦女和國貨的認識和服用，集思廣益的縝密的去研究訓練，同時請幾位國貨專家，指導着用各種方法去向低級程度的婦女界宣傳，使得一切婦女都抬起頭來注意國貨。</p>
<p>近來社會上的士女們，不是有一個﹁家庭日新會﹂的組織麽？這正是努力向婦女們灌輸愛用國貨的好機會，我常常想：目下要家庭日新，家事改進，先决問題還是在於服用國貨一點上，希望許多主婦們能夠切實的追蹤着社會共同來負起這重使命。</p>

<p>— 王月輝</p>
<p>煉乳一物。我國向無製造。惟年來銷行甚盛。據海關統計。每年進口額達兩千萬元。此項巨額漏巵。國人竟不設法挽回。長此以往。何堪設想。於是有蕭家幹先生者。於悵痛之餘。立志自製煉乳。以資代替。歷經挫折。卒底於成。迄今燕牌煉乳可可牛奶等。銷行市上者。皆國貨也。兹將蕭先生創辦煉乳公司之經過。略致介紹於後。用示表揚。</p>
<p>蕭家幹先生。浙省嘉興人。民十三卒業復旦大學商科後。即服務靑島山東省立銀行。某日。蕭氏偶與朋儕談及煉乳類舶來品銷行國内之盛。深致憤恨。乃即蓄意製造煉乳。以期挽回利權於萬一。惟渠自思非製乳專才。操切從事。必難成就。於是着手調查。凡關於牛乳經營乳産品製造法等西書。大批購閱。努力求知。以爲實行經營之準備。</p>
<p>蕭氏特志旣定。乃毅然辭去銀行職務。南行返浙。一方執敎鞭於浙省商科中學。以維生計。一方與友人屠補山邱石麟等合股設立消毒牛乳公司。以求經騐。工作餘暇。即試騐煉乳製造。經一百二十七次之試製。屢敗屢繼。方慶成功。惟煉乳機器如眞空機結晶機等。價值十餘萬元。須向國外訂購。蕭氏家道淸貧。如此鉅欵。斷難籌措。壯志頓沮。一日。偶見路旁高懸一標語曰。﹁有志者事竟成﹂。不禁心意大動。立志益决。乃向某日本書肆。輾轉索得機械圖書目錄。擬按圖仿造。友儕均笑爲狂謬。都不之信。然蕭氏仍鼓勇進行。嘗於午夜伏案模繪機器草圖。雖疾病時作。毫不介意。民十八年冬。蕭氏按照繪成之草圖。依其說明程叙。實行仿造眞空機消毒鍋結晶機三組。初以材料配合。諸多不當。多次改拆。卒於十九年冬各機全部成功。於是集合資要六萬元。成立西湖煉乳公司。採辦牛隻。建造牛棚。添置機器。於二十年冬出燕牌煉乳及可可牛奶等銷行市上。現江浙及南洋一帶僑胞。均來採購。洵以售價低廉。（煉乳每箱售價二十元可可牛奶每箱售價三十元）·而品質優良。較之舶來品。自無不逮之處也。</p>
<p>現該公司有一千餘畝之牧塲。有二七百十餘頭之乳牛。規模日漸宏大。刻蕭氏鑒於資本微末。不足以資發展。乃於月前來京。向中央陳述創立經過。請予協助。深得中委陳立夫余井塘諸先生贊許。允爲設法徵股。此區區之數。當不難於最短期内募足。該公司之前途。殊無量也。</p>

<p>按最近三年吾川進口貨值，每年均約三千餘萬兩，而其中洋貨約佔百分之八十，利權外溢，爲數甚鉅，加以吾省莊客，遵循舊有習慣，至欠完善，不但來貨成本較高，且以曾有莊客在申倒塌逃避，致川帮在滬信用，日漸消失，查川帮普通在外埠採辦上貨之過程如次：</p>
<p>層層盤繳，重重分利，亟應設法革除，以輕貨本，同人等蓄志已久，適今年中國銀行張君禹九來川，相與道及國貨銷塲之不振，謀所以改善之道，深爲契合，爰有中華國貨介紹所組織之發起　　本年六月，由發起人公推童少生陳叔敬兩君赴滬，調查接洽。蒙張公權先生熱誠贊助，並由中國銀行各要人導引參觀各國貨工廠四十餘家，當與各廠面訂推銷辦法。因急須籌備内部，故僅留四十餘日，即行返渝，現已於十月一日正式成立，實行介紹工作。基於本所組織之動機，擬將前述辦貨過程簡化爲：</p>
<p>就右式觀之，本所殆爲廠家之特約經理，上海中華國貨産銷協會之直接代表，中間減少若干不必要之糜費，而復承中國銀行之援后，故實際上由本所代爲採辦，成本可期降底，手續可期簡捷，同時川帮對於外埠金融界之信用，以有法定及有組織之團體，或稍可恢復原有之地位也。簡言之，介紹所之組織，殆爲川帮駐外購買貨之公用莊客，對於本地字號或批發商，純欲盡其最大量之貢獻，而並無侵佔之意味或趨勢，蓋介紹所之經濟目的，乃基於各種繳用之節省，以求國貨之暢銷，而對於各字號或批發商之利益，並無若何衝突之處也。</p>
<p>至於本所特點，提要如左：</p>
<p>（甲）對於廠方</p>
<p>（一）有限公司註册富有法律保障（二）廠商交易對手可以化繁爲簡（三）代做宣傳工作比較省費合用（四）調查各地銷塲可函本所照辦（五）貢獻改良意見隨時敬供採納（六）直接代廠推銷目標力求推廣</p>

<p>其實，﹁兩﹂作惡的所在很多，例如歐美各國，一面同我國十分親熱，一面向日本暗送秋波，這是﹁兩面光﹂。我國北方儘同日本兵拳來脚去，砲敬刀還，在南方依舊同日本人握手言歡，敦交睦誼，這是騎着﹁兩頭馬﹂。再說到家庭問題。一子兼祧，娶着兩個老婆，呌做﹁兩頭大﹂。但是﹁先進廟門三日大﹂，泥菩薩也要講二個法律，挨一個次序，新來慢到，不客氣，至多尊一聲﹁副太太﹂。不這麽着，準會閙得家堂逃難，竈君搬家，從此家庭多事矣。</p>
<p>明版康熙字典上說，﹁兩﹂﹁二﹂也，﹁元﹂﹁一﹂也。﹁大道以多岐而亡羊﹂，人生大道，得一而足，我們中國到處徬徨，就苦在不肯﹁從一而終﹂，﹁一直到底﹂。﹁天無二日，民無二王﹂，你想做英雄，我想做好漢，此路不通。現在﹁廢兩改元﹂大家來從頭做起，或許中國還有救。　　有人說，﹁廢兩改元，一而二，二而一也一。唉，﹁介末眞是阿元戴帽子，完哉﹂！</p>
<h3 id="c231">兩種屈死醉痴生 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>上海地方，每年﹁春﹂和﹁冬﹂兩個時期中，往往有許多﹁屈死﹂的人。這﹁屈死﹂的人，却分兩種死法，但都是爲了起居飲食不愼而犧牲。</p>
<p>在春令二三月的時候，報紙上時常可以瞧到﹁食河豚子中毒斃命﹂的新聞，受害的人，大都是勞苦階級的江北人居多。他們在垃圾桶中拾着了河豚子，也有貪便宜的買了河豚子，回家煑食之後，便毒發腹中脹痛，宛轉呼號，多救治無效而死；甚至有全家斃命的。好好的人爲逞口腹之欲，無端犧牲寳貴的生命。這樣的死法，眞好算是﹁屈死﹂。</p>
<p>到了冬令，天氣寒冷的時候，報紙上又時常會瞧見﹁燃煤球中毒斃命﹂的新聞。他們又都是經濟的人家，住在亭子間裏，遇着天冷，就燃着煤球取暖，將窗户緊閉。因爲空氣不通，中了煤氣的毒。人漸漸暈去，也有全家中毒斃命的。閱報的看了，也只有嘆一聲道：可憐呀﹁屈死﹂？</p>
<p>以上兩種﹁屈死﹂，到了這兩個時期，便會續續的發現，好像應時刻板的文章。推其原因，都由他們缺乏常識，不知危險的緣故。也不得不歸咎於社會敎育，不能普及，纔會産生這般無知識的人民，而得到這樣悲慘的結果。</p>
<p>按醫籍載：河豚有大毒。以蘆根橄欖煎服，可解。其子尤毒，水浸一夜，大如芡實；中其毒者，亟以槐花微炒，與乾胭脂等分同擣，水調灌服有效。因食河豚子中毒多不救，特附記於此，以備採用，二物藥店均有售。</p>
<p>耕堤上火雪明</p>
<p>中午太陽的光，薄瀉在耕堤上，膏了一層檬檬色彩。宿冬的細草伸起懶腰，在呼吸田野的異香。風淡淡地吹，草舞動了靑靑的衫子，把戀立在身上的白蝴蝶，驚走飛遁了。</p>
<p>沿河兩岸，全是塍，被五步一株的楊柳樹偃照着，草就不易灼得顦顇。楊柳葉抽得長，顔色也從嫩黄變成翠綠，依戀在俯仰的椏枝上，有的低着頭探進水面去照自己的姿態，有的挺起了身子，高瞪着靑遠的春空，但一律給自己的影子，倒映於平靜的暖波上。</p>
<p>爲要呼吸點春野的空氣，拖着籐杖漫步到河濱來。經過石橋，便緊接着耕堤。立在堤上，向空廣的大自然裏悠悠地思索，温凉的風在吹，陽光在沐，細小的天籟在奏，可以忘了故世的艱難，而貪羡到出世的趣味。我就站住了。</p>
<p>靜默中，水聲突然響起來，似乎有槳打着水面，而且遠處又傳來了輕微的唿哨。回頭看，那尖狹的另一端碧流上，浮下一葉漁艇，瘦長的艇，好像一尾海帶，漸漸近了，看得出艇的兩舷，滿蹲着一點一點灰黑的長嘴鳥，我們鄉間喚做﹁摸魚公﹂，其實就是爾雅所稱鵜鶘的。杜工部詩﹁江中洵河赫飛燕﹂，淘河，就是這種最善行在水底捕魚的水鳥。</p>
<p>漁人拿着長竹竿，吹着唿哨，幹鵜鶘涉水，它們便把鴨一樣的頸向水面下鑽，好久才起來，準準從嘴裏嘔出三兩尾魚兒。因爲它們的頸被縛着繩，所以雖有魚兒在口，還是不能吞下果腹。這好像也是對着人作嫁者的一個Ｌessono</p>
<p>照例，漁人捉着鵜鶘的頸，只要向下倒掛，鵜鶘昻頭一　，再本能地埀下，從它的犂嘴裏吐出鯽或白小，漁人順手捉下，放在簣薦裏，便笑了。鵜鶘它自己，根本没有懂得爲了誰生存着在。</p>
<p>不管漁艇駛得多末遠，鵜鶘在水下準會跟着漁艇游，好像放出去的白鴿會千里飛歸來的樣子；每一頭鵜鶘的價值，最貴的要值三十多元。</p>
<p>漸漸漁艇穿過河灣，黑羽的水鳥依舊殷勤地工作着。漁人安逸撑着竹篙唿哨，被楊柳的綠蔭遮住，就瞧不見了。</p>
<p>雖然我没有感想，也没有悲哀，但如果我不是鵜鶘，爲什麽也朝夕替人家在找魚呢！</p>

<p>梅蘭芳氏現寓滬濱，時或赴蘇浙等處游覽。日昨記者晤及，便中詢以數糧問題，兹記其問答如下（　）日前見報載：足卜與宋春舫先生談話，有論及擬加西樂入中劇一節，並舉及李石曾先生所云菩蕯坐飛機等語，此　確乎？</p>
<p>（　）鄙人與春舫先生相稔，日前確有關於戲劇之談話，其眞實内容：爲宋先生主張應改良中劇之音樂，而自　對於音樂並非專家，故徵求余之意見。余答以鄙意亦以爲須改良，蓋余以爲中劇音樂確是過於單簡，余早抱有此之見解，且夙有種種試騐。例如余上台以來，如恢復四絃之月琴；如加蘇胡以襯胡琴；如加九音　；如碰鏡；如將鼓之適用於舞蹈，皆爲余所提倡，十五六年以來，舞台上已成爲風尚。但余終以爲皮黄劇，音樂，仍屬不足，故余在北平時曾以意創造胡琴二種，一高音；一中音；一低音，不幸試騐結果，未能圓滿，故余亦曾有一度擬將西樂加入中劇之意思。但佘意僅屬參加如粤劇舞台之創造，卽可欽佩，但似須更求合作與改良。至與宋先生談話時，並不曾提及石曾先生及菩薩坐飛機一語，因余對於此語，尚係從此次報紙上見之，更談不到作何解釋也（問）聞君有意因年齡關係，有不扮旦角或改扮話劇小生之說，確乎？</p>
<p>（答）余意在劇界先例上，多唱幾年，亦是無妨，但須演相當的戲劇耳。現在余對此問題，尚未詳加考慮，至在話劇中改扮小生，余郤極願加以研究，但非研究純熱，無嘗試之可能也。</p>
<p>（問）報載君有與胡蝶女士演蝴蝶夫人以及各種有聲電影，此事確乎？</p>
<p>（答）所謂蝴蝶夫人之事，余亦僅自報紙知之，余與影界諸明星亦但在各影業公司宴會席上一相晤對而已。至於有聲電影及任何影劇，余均在考慮中，並未與任何公同有何决定，報紙所謂十萬元演覇王别姬，同爲四月一日式之新聞也最後梅氏見告，渠所以留滬者，實以本爲蘇人，故擬及時遍覧江南之春光，日内並擬赴揚子江各埠游覧，或至廬山亦未可定云。</p>

<p>— 銀絲</p>
<p>女子職業在現社會上，早已和男子們處於同等的地位。但在實際上的觀察，還是一種畸形的發展最近。某機關登報招考女子職員，結果由兩位身材婀娜，容姿妙曼的Ａ女士和Ｂ女士，經過一番嚴格的審擇而當選了。伊們倆從此安心供職，很覺欣幸。但在那裏鎭天的枯坐着，除有幾位同事時時向伊們說笑打趣，逗引取樂外，簡直尸位素餐，一無所事。這樣過了一個多月，Ｂ女士早和他們出入相偕，水乳交融。Ａ女士却絶端相反，始終保持伊冷若氷霜的嚴峻態度，未嘗稍假辭色。而處於這樣無聊的環境中，更是暗暗詫怪，莫悉端倪。没有幾天，Ｂ女士怱爾登門造訪，說了一席特地代表男同事們明言相規，力勸變志，否則快請早自爲謀，另作他圖的話。Ａ女士這才如夢初醒，恍然大悟。原來伊們兩人，是幾位同事公衆合資所僱，並非　關任用。據說；作用所在，是專爲調劑辦公室中枯燥的空氣的！</p>
<p>這件新奇的故實，確是畸形社會上女子職業的一個側面縮影。我們誠然覺得非常可嘆。同時，又看了一部類似此事的影睛，丨明星公司女性的呐喊﹂。更使我發生了無限的感　。此片對於女子職業的一角，作現實的描寫。形容得沉痛有力，凄楚動人。的係一部時代需要的好作品。本來﹁呐喊﹂是被歷迫者的慘厲呼聲。不知道女同胞們看了，又將作何感想？</p>

<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>﹁國難期間，﹂從報上，也可以看出要人們的忙碌情形的。所以雖不必凡要人都有自備飛機，但凡自備飛機的必都是要人，可無疑義。騰雲架霧，高來高往，今天到□處﹁視察，﹂明天到□處﹁坐鎭﹂，上午在北平，下午却到了上海，何等迅速，輕便？所謂﹁整個計劃﹂，﹁抗日决心﹂就都是在這飛機上想定的。而一旦知難而退，便又把牠轉送另外的要人，也可以作爲臨别紀念，﹁另有借重﹂，以誌不忘，飛機之爲用，大矣哉。</p>
<p>然而從報上，又可以看出要人們的悠閒自得，好整以暇。譬如前幾天的報上，就發現﹁□主席之閒情逸致﹂，外加花邊的消息。外加花邊，根據我的讀報經騐，這都是極可珍貴的新聞。這標題就無異乎表示：連主席也這麽閒暇起來，自然是天下太平，國難已過，國民們頗可以﹁打打麻將﹂了。那新聞的大意是說﹁□主席今日微服到舊書店購古籍數本，骨董數件﹂，步行回衙。（達按：因爲是專電，電内并無此句，大抵是節省電費，故不詳載。）身爲主席，要買幾本古籍，幾件骨董，自然是小而又小的事，國體旣不禁止打高爾夫，跳查爾斯登，當然也不禁止買舊書骨董。而且，脫下朝衣朝帽，微服而出，也就比高車駟馬，前呼後擁的可敬可愛得多。</p>
<p>然而這﹁微服﹂兩字，不知怎的，却使我聯想到舊小說上所謂淸正廉明，﹁微服私訪﹂的官吏，和撞下大禍，﹁微服而逃﹂的公子少年。幸虧□主席的﹁微服﹂是到舊書攤去買書，并無危險。早年的私訪和逃走都要使人躭心的。然而，這也正可見要人們的雍容鎭靜，好整以暇了。同日的報上，還有一條坐鎭北平，指揮抗日軍事的□□□將軍，答應英使藍博森十二日同赴郊外打獵。</p>
<p>這國難臨頭，要人仍有閒情逸致的事，歷考史傳，是﹁古已有之﹂的。最有名的淮水之役，不但遠在長城之外，而且越過黄河，直迫淮水的秦兵來了，宰相謝安，還在面不改色的着棋，小說三國演義中的諸葛孔明彈琴退司馬，都是傳誦至今的﹁閒情逸致﹂。迄至現代，瀋陽事發，少帥正在歌舞方酣，上海之役，忽要開發西北，熱河失守，坐鎭却從北方忽然移到南方，這都是要人們的﹁閒情逸致﹂。而東北三省，錦州，榆關，承德就都在要人們閒情逸致中，改了顔色；買幾本古書，幾件骨董的閒情逸致，算得什麽？安知買幾本古書，幾件骨董，或圍塲打獵，不能像謝安的棋，諸葛的琴一樣，退却敵兵呢？</p>

<p>經過了半天的水程，當小汽船靠攏碼頭的時候，已是五點鐘了。在船艙裏伸了一個懶腰，扶着船夫的肩頭，跳上陸地；從水面拂來的輕風，偷偷地吹散了兩年來蟄居在上海積下的厭倦。　　抬起眼睛，向東方凝視，那充滿着肉底氣息的，喧囂底機聲的，墮落底顔色的······城市，似乎依舊在渺茫的白雲底下隠現着。</p>
<p>！啊，永别了，萬惡的上海呀！</p>
<p>微微的嘆了一聲，提起脚步沿着田岸向近處簇林中的村落踱去，路傍的麥秀，輕搖着頭，彷彿迎接久别的主人。那埋在夕陽餘暉裏的靑山，泛着金色閃光的溪流，伏在河邊的漁夫，騎在牛背上的牧童，以及從前所忽視的景象，現在都使我感到驚奇了。我的眼睛好像一架貪婪的攝影師的照相機似的，毫不饜足的向四方旋轉着。</p>
<p>帶着纔出嫁的新娘子的羞澀和愉快的姿態走進了家門，暗暗地引起隣居的驚愕；一直到了吃飯的時候，他們還圍着我的母親，彷彿想刺探一點新鮮的消息。</p>
<p>敲過九點鐘，我離開家人獨自走入一間幽靜的書房裏。泡了一壺茶，邀請一位不大咳嗽的老年人閑談，自己却臥在牀上；牀邊點着一支紅燭。開了窗，讓風吹進來微微搖動着火熖；整間的空氣似乎都在抖顫着。老人坐在我的身傍，憂鬱地說出我别後兩年來的村中的故事。起初我倒十分的興奮，可是不久，我失望了，流涙了。</p>
<p>夜深了，他懶懶地走了，房間裏靜得連老鼠的聲音都聽得見。門外野犬的狂吠，一下下地叩着我的心弦。剛纔刻在心靈上的故事，默默地在眼前展開了：　　幕春的時節，雨丨一天一天地，不斷地。</p>

<p>雜亂的，斷片的回憶，蛆蟲似的咬着我的心，兩年來追求着的理想的鄉村生活，在一刹那間毁滅了。</p>
<p>第二天淸晨，當太陽還未爬上山頂的時候，我又悄悄地上了汽船，依舊回到﹁萬惡的上海﹂了。</p>

<p>（十七）章太炎論貧苦階級</p>
<p>頃來章太炎先生之於革命，傾向於正反左右之任何一方，留待來日史家，吾人殊不欲置論。惟章先生寓居東京同盟會時代，爲黨人中極左傾極急進之一人，則灼然無疑，有可爲後進告者。民報尚存，有文爲證。彼撰革命之道德長文，謂今之道德大率從於職業而變，都計其業，則有十六種人：一曰農人，二曰工人，三曰裨販，四曰坐賈，五曰學究，六曰藝士，七曰通人，八曰行伍，九曰胥徒，十曰幕客，十一曰職商，十二曰京朝客，十三曰方面官，十四曰軍官，十五曰差除官，十六曰雇譯六。其職業凡十六等，其道德之第次亦十六等，雖非　如畫一，然可得其槪略。自藝士上，率在道德之域，通人以下二　多　　德者　　　也知　　念　　　位愈申，則離於德也愈遠。今與藝士通人居，必不如與學究居之樂也：與學究居，必不如與農工裨販坐賈居之樂也；與了壯有職業者居，必不如與兒童無職業者居之樂也。又謂農人於道德爲最高，其人勞神苦形，終歲勤動，田園塲　之　入，足以自養，不知大下有營求詐幻事。平居之遇官長，　甚謹畏，適有貪殘之史，頭會箕歛，誅求無度，則起而爲變。及其就死，亦甘之如飴。工人稍知詐僞，楛窳之器，緜薄之材，有時以欺市人，然甚强毅不屈，亦與農人無異。章先生直以農工道德冠於羣倫，負販小商人次之，名位不高之智識分子又次之。自所謂名流學者之通人，至於官僚，軍閥，買辦階級愈降而愈下。至於置兵士於通人之次，殆未知兵士出於農工階級，多因失業無依，乃虱處行伍之中也。又章先生在民報紀元節慶視大會自譔演說辭，榷論革命性之强弱，至以貧苦階级之强盜會黨爲最强，小資産階級之智識分子次之，官僚軍閥則反革命。文爲白話，撮要如次：</p>
<p>現在的革命，俗稱秀才造反，以前的革命，俗稱强盜結義。强盜有力　，　才没有力長；强盜仰攀　　官府，秀才仰攀的上官府：所以强盜起事，没有依賴督撫的心，秀才就有依賴督撫的心。前此數年，徧地是借權的話，直到如今講革命的，也想借到督撫的權，好謀大事，這眞胡塗得很。頗有人說，學界中人不如會黨，會黨不如强盜。依兄弟看來，知識高下且不必說，但强盜從没有靠官造反的心，會黨略有數分，學界中人更加數倍，論他志氣的下劣，與自信力的薄弱，較之會黨强盜不免有些慚愧。</p>
<p>且看從古革命的歷史，凡從草茅崛起的，所用都是樸實勤廉的人士，就把前代弊政一掃而盡。若是强藩内侵，權臣受禪，政治總與前朝一樣，全無改革。因爲帝王雖換，官吏依然不換，前代腐敗貪汚的風俗流傳下來，再也不能打掃。像現在官塲情景，是微蟲徽菌到處流毒，不是平民革命，怎麽避得這些瘴氣吾人子細玩索章先生之言，反顧二十餘年來之中國革命，不難平讞辛亥革命之所以失敗，殿最輓近革命之具何成績矣。</p>

<p>﹁電車誤了時刻，對不起。﹂</p>
<p>海泉再笑着回答。但心裏想，他媽的，也要這樣的作威作福麽。</p>
<p>﹁說十二點到這裏來，你就該預備早一點！······﹂</p>
<p>耀星的能度似乎和緩了一點。</p>
<p>﹁趕快點去，還來得及的。﹂</p>
<p>那個戴鴨舌帽的靑年老氣横秋地說。</p>
<p>﹁是的。·········﹂</p>
<p>看耀星對這位靑年的態度是恭順的。他忙從他的床下檢出了一束印刷品交給海泉。</p>
<p>﹁你趕快到白渡橋傍邊外灘公園後面的馬路上去，看見他們呌起口號來的時候，你就發散這些傳單給那頭的羣衆。在那邊有不少的碼頭工人，最好向工人們撒你的傳單！······﹂</p>
<p>海泉心裏有點害怕，但不能不把那一大束傳單接了過來。他的胸口也突突地跳動了。</p>
<p>﹁快點走！﹂</p>
<p>唐耀星像向他下命令般的，海泉只好抱着一顆顫動着的心房，搭電車向外灘來。</p>
<p>果然在白渡橋邊，外灘公園的後面，他看見了有十三四個所謂同志的靑年。有的像他一樣拿着一束的印刷品，有的拿着給彩色的紙捲着的短竹竿兒，丨丨遊行用的旗子。他遠看見了有兩位女同志。她們的態度似乎比那些男性同志安間。她們的置生死於度外的態度給了海泉以不少的感奮。於是他和她們一樣地緊張起來了。海泉再望了望那些同志們，個個　是臉色蒼白，像垂死的人，而他們的神氣則異常的緊張，若臨大敵。</p>
<p>海泉無意中向馬路那一邊望去，他發見了李一香和他的幾位朋友也在日本郵船公司的面前踱來踱去。他們都背着手，手裏拿着一本書。海泉看見了李一香先生後，就像沙漠中發見了淸泉，歡喜得要高呼起來了。他望了望兩頭，車輛少了點的時候，忙横斷了馬路，走到　一香先生面前來。</p>
<p>﹁李先生！﹂</p>

<p>﹁哦，哦，哦。﹂</p>
<p>李一香看見他後，只﹁哦﹂了幾聲，臉上表示出一種不高興的神氣。海泉直覺着李先生只是没有說不認識他了。同時，他注意到李先生望了望海泉手裏的那束印刷品時臉上就表示出害怕的樣子。李一香蹙着眉頭，伸動了一下他的下顎，似乎是呌他趕快走回馬路那一邊去。看見李一香那樣冷冰冰的態度，海泉也冷了半截，他無意中望了一下李先生手裏的一大册洋裝書認得是新舊約全書。還有兩位文壇先進手中的書是西立的，海泉没有心緒再加以審察了。　　當他回到馬路這一邊來，還没有立穏脚步，看見那些同志都打開了他們的寫有標語的彩色紙旗，由當頭的指揮者高呌了一聲：</p>

<p>揭價因匯豐銀行掛牌美匯長一二五、計二零元二五、合金價一一八五元、照收盤價言約撳九十九元餘、較之前收祇少撳半元、本月份登販一零九二元、五月份登賬一零八六元、補比一零八八元、</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>假如我們對於國事仍是十分關心而每天仍是相信報紙之記載的話，那末我們很可以明白，東北一角現在又充滿和平氣象了，很顯然的，這並不是說日帝國主義者從此收歛了侵略的野心，而是我們中國之酷愛和平而不停的﹁誘敵深入﹂。然而究竟﹁深入﹂到什麽地方爲止，可惜現在還没有明白規定，假如每一個﹁民族英雄﹂都懂得了這種﹁戰略﹂的奥妙，那末一直可讓敵人深入到黄河南岸了。</p>
<p>如此這般，正顯揚出中國酷愛和平之美德。</p>
<p>然而也不是每一個中國人都愛好和平的，有些時候，這種美德也有點靠不大住，譬如有時候在電車中不幸給别人踏了一脚，不免動武，在戲院中給别人搶去了坐位，也不免動武，甚至於在其他一切針尖大小的事件中，常落得斯文掃地，這是說反正大家都是中國人，當然閙得最起勁，就如目前揚子岸兩岸，眞是殺得血流成河，屍横遍野，好不熱閙，由此可知，中國人之愛和平，只是對外而言，而對内却大可不必。</p>
<p>遼吉黑三省，在和平的標榜之下，奉送給日本做木頭人戲的大舞臺了，上海戰爭，犧牲了無數生靈，也在和平的標榜之下﹁協定﹂了，最後的一省熱河，當然也就這樣在和平的標榜之下而讓敵人長驅直入了，大槪關起萬里長城的鐵門，反正義勇軍不見得一時就完全變成砲灰，假如收疊細軟封車搬家，總還不致於手忙脚亂的。然而有許多窮苦的老百姓們，却不願﹁因和平而受累﹂而主張奮力抵抗，磨拳擦掌，堅决的反對帝國主義而永遠鞏固和平，可是這種呐喊，終於因爲没有舌頭，一時還不能響徹雲霄，於是大家只落得戴着和平的花冠而在槍刀尖上跳舞了。</p>
<p>和平罷，有許多人在日夜眠思夢想，只有大多數的人們，他們總有一天會揭穿這和平之幻幕的吧。</p>

<p>整疊的報紙放在寫字台下已有幾天没有翻看，並不是台駕貴忙，似乎感覺看報紙是受罪；三天不看以後，就把每天送來的報紙往寫字台下一抛成了習慣。　　今天有親戚不遠千里從鄉下來，少不得以小（並不老）上海的資格，邀他們觀光觀光咱們的花花世界。翻開當天的申報本埠增刊，我好像年輕了幾歲，當初在學生時代趨之若鶩的老把戲，又在﹁航空救國﹂的呼聲中舊店新開；電影院奉工部局電檢會諭，年在十七歲下之兒童，恕不招待者一處，乂乂乂歌舞團以女人的肉號占者七八處；更有﹁今日最後一天，爲優待觀衆起見，特加演美的舞一幕，凡未滿十六歲兒童，槪不招待入座﹂等語特别注明這裏有好戲看。</p>
<p>九一八以前，上海玩着這套把戲，熱河失守以後，上海還是玩着這套把戲，除了一二八，日本人到太歲頭上來動土，才毁家紓難，捐絲棉馬夾······博一個愛國的頭銜。現在上海還是照樣上海，我們還是玩這套救國不忘肉感的老把戲罷。</p>
<p>同時不抵抗將軍及其眷屬昨晚登輪今晨放洋的標題，也三生有幸的見到。造成一二八滬戰的罪魁禍首，他悄悄地到海外去打高而夫了，上海人對之不知作何感想？雖然聽說有人敢向一八一號從前的大賭窟，不抵抗將軍出國前的行轅抛上一個炸彈；但是將軍仍舊精神萎頓的到外國跳舞塲去做蝴蝶美夢。將軍闖下了滔天大禍，而不能傷他絲毫，堂而皇之在送行聲中携眷放洋。但是話要說回來，上海人除了和黄包車爭吵一枚銅元時王筋哼六筋外，夙以寛大爲懷，些些小事，請將軍在康脫魯素輪上，别遺憾終身吧！君不見﹁歌舞（乂乂乂歌舞團之歌舞）昇平﹂，早已天下太平。至於帶走幾件頤和園的古字畫，出賣一所海</p>

<p>據北平電文所述：﹁蘇馬李王眷屬及部隊千餘人，自蘇俄返國後，即住於新世界樓，因地方狹小，汚穢異常，······連日因傳染病死亡者達十餘人······云云。﹂一年來抵抗不死於槍林彈雨之下的蘇馬李王部屬，結果竟染病而亡於地方狹小汚穢異常之北平新世界樓，倒令記者不能不有以下的感想發生了。　　蘇馬李王部隊在暴日蹂躪着冰天雪地的東北和敵人轟轟烈烈的抵抗了整個年頭，最後雖然免不了因爲彈盡援絶而慘敗退入俄境。但事實彰彰，無論如何他們總已表揚我中華民族精神於世界，他們早己替中國的歷中外增加了光榮的若干頁；給世界列强一種驚奇，給暴日不少敎訓。我們苟安暫時的同胞對於這些爲民族國體增光的民族英雄，應如何的景仰崇拜？最低限度，我以爲也應該向他們表示敬意同情！</p>
<p>現在爲國體民族增光的民族英雄蘇馬王李部隊，已由莫斯科返國了；而且其中不幸中之一部份，丨丨十餘人因爲新世界樓地方的齷齪汚穢而染病死亡了丨爲國爲民爭面子不惜犧牲一切的民族英雄；不幸因爲彈盡援絶慘敗而返到祖國，結果連一些良好的待遇也没有，而至染病而死。關於這點，我以爲大半可以歸罪於中國政府之不良，小半可以歸罪於我們中國人民之太不負責。</p>
<p>其實這又算得是怎樣了不得的一回事，能夠撥出新世界樓來安置由俄國歸國的他們已算是天大的徼幸了。國家現在不是在經濟恐慌嗎？要人們鑒於國庫空虚，將發行救國公債，救國基金······等之不暇，又怎有閒心閒錢來招待現在對於他們不關痛癢的蘇馬王李部屬？中國横豎現在需要的是購買認銷救國公債的人，不是需要因抵抗暴日餘剩下來的蘇馬李王部屬；不過，說來說去，只虧負了爲抗日戰死的民族英雄，和犧牲未遂餘剩下來的蘇馬李王部隊和眷屬吧了。欲求生存惟有奮鬥未</p>

<p>抱豹先生：</p>
<p>讀了你的大札之後，使吾憶起二年以前情景，我也曾遇到這樣一椿類同的事，至今引以爲遺憾，因此益信早年失學的靑年是太不幸了。</p>
<p>你的信好像是是﹁不平﹂促成的反嚮也似替許多遭着不幸而有志向學的靑年們呐喊着。這是應當的，在這樣一個矛盾社會裏，到處可以聽到同樣的鳴聲：但是究竟是徒然。　認爲它只能　一輩人以微量的　惓而已；呐喊是呐喊　考試是考試，資格還是資格。憑你大聲疾呼，喊啞了喉嚨，那些自命不凡的人祇是﹁吾行我素﹂；决不能使他們動容，來附會你，或者表示﹁你有相當程度，而無文憑﹂引爲遺憾的。</p>
<p>老友Ｋ君，在一個五年的高中畢業後，因窘迫而不得不挾着自己也不滿足的學識，來服務於社會。他是很能幹，成績極好，所以對於他的職務，很能勝任愉快。去年他想提高自己的地位，曾一度應微某機關的考試，滿想藉此可以得到比較優越的地位。畢竟他時運不濟，流年欠佳，被那位監考大臣嚴格地拒絶了：理由是丨﹁未曾登記的學校的文憑，是無效的。﹂他丨我不幸的老友丨聲明四年前各學校是都没有登記的，他是四年前畢業的。他這樣的聲述，顯見是冀望着有變通底餘地，然而自命爲﹁選拔眞材﹂的監考大臣，只是頻頻搖首，終於不免一番激烈的爭辯，他忿然失望地跑來告訴我以他的際遇。最後，他還補充一句：﹁我眞不懂，爲什麽他們拿考試看得這樣的重要？錄取之後，﹁有公辦公，無公看報打瞌　﹂爲什麽又這樣的鬆懈？那些工作並不是普通一輩人所不能爲的，何必斤斤較量在考試呢？﹂我默然地微笑笑他丨我的Ｋ君丨已經明白現在的社會是這樣的，不過需要我的解釋吧了。</p>
<p>﹁這是社會矛盾的現象，在這個矛盾社會裏，你要學乖些，說些矛盾的話，做些矛盾的事，才配做一個﹁摩登﹂人物﹂丨吾是這樣的爲他解釋。</p>
<p>先生，你以爲如何？像我們没有力量與乎充分的時間，要求些較高的學識，的確很是困難。如果你認爲一頂方帽兒的資格丨在你可能範圍之内丨至少要有的，或者認爲有超深的必要時，盡力地前進。但是我要請你用顯微鏡將整個社會底情形細察一下，你一定會見到方帽兒的主人們，嫌着當舗設立太少，正愁慮没處典質他們的方帽兒呢！</p>
<p>並不是吾愛說些没志氣及没出息的話，像吾們没有力量的人，太高的學識，在商業上是無用的，祇要有相當程度就可以了。（這一層也許你以爲不然，因爲我不曾明瞭你底處境，請你原諒，）吾常這般想···處於目今的時勢識學，和能力（能力指經濟和閱歷而言）？究竟什麽是比較重要些丨吾的徧見是學識果然要有，但能力更不可缺乏。有學識而無能力，等於有船無槳，是不行的。所以你說的那兩個最高商學院的學生所學的，吾不敢說將來完全能適合於吾國的社會呢！我更自信未必没有眞材便算無能，和有能力而乏識的就不能立足謀生。那末，吾們何必廢時失業去弄，這種玄虚，因此你不必以商學院爲懷，須知道學問兩字的眞義是隨時隨地可學可問的，只有能力是奮鬥出來的。</p>
<p>奮鬥吧！朋友！努力地奮鬥呀！祝你</p>
<p>幸福　　　江仁棣</p>
<p>編者按：江君說四月四日本欄發表的那封抱豹君的信，是﹁不平﹂的反響。但是江君的這封信，也何嘗不然：而且憤懣的程度，有過之，無不及呢。在這種社會裏，自然，誰都免不掉要發牢騷呀！你說﹁有學識而無能力，等於有船無漿；﹂誠然是不錯的。但是我們以爲﹁有學識而無能力，等於一只大船，却並有帆槳之屬，﹂當然寸步難行。但是﹁有能力而無學識，等於一只小船，雖有雙槳，﹂一遇風浪，勢必顛覆。惟﹁有學識且有能力者，才等於大船之上，配有帆槳之屬，﹂方能乘風破浪也。所以我們還不能不喊﹁敎育機會均等﹂的口號，希望社會人士，大家這樣喊，而且要大聲疾呼的喊。這喊的結果，或許不至於等於零吧！</p>

<p>— 馨甫</p>
<p>﹁桃花村﹂及﹁春江花月夜﹂兩片到滬</p>
<p>二十五年來的全球電影界，老是讓美國稱霸着；但是近年以來，萬事不願後人的德國，已在掙扎困苦中，極力奮鬥，想和美國一决雌雄，他們雖有雄厚的魄力，但還恐怕自己人才不足，因和英國聯合起來，用兩國的實力，去爭取全世界影業的霸主；而這合作的公司，現時都正在執着兩國影業的牛耳，一個是德國的烏發，一個是英國的高蒙，</p>
<p>﹁桃花村﹂ＨappyＥverＡfter和﹁春江花月夜﹂ＴellＭeＴo-night兩個片子，就是德英影業聯合下初試其鋒的新作品，在歐美各地公映的時候，不但歐洲輿論界，極力揄揚贊美；就是美國的報章雜誌，也滿載着一種驚奇的論調。這兩部片子，現在已經運到中國。我且先來把兩片的内容，向讀者作一個簡單的報告，</p>
<p>﹁桃花村﹂的故事，是寫無産階級中的一段三角戀愛史，甜中帶些苦味，﹁春江花月夜﹂是描寫一位歌唱家的艶遇，要是就意識方面說，這兩個片子，並没有什麽特殊的地方；但是他們能利用美妙的攝影，新奇的音樂，巧妙的接剪和深刻的描寫，去做成兩部純粹藝術化的佳片，最值得贊美的，尤其是他們在這兩部片子裏，能夠儘量的去採取鄉村的天然美景，令人生出無限的快感來，　　一張倫敦日報上說：﹁桃花村﹂演映的時間爲八十六分鐘，﹁春江花月夜﹂的演映時間爲九十一分鐘；但是開映的時候，有許多朋友都說片子怎麽這樣短，好像二三十分鐘就映畢了！﹂意思就是說片子好不過，看的人竟把這實際上的時光，於不知不覺中度過了，我們從這一點上上看起來，可以證明西歐人士，歡迎這兩部片子的熱烈了。</p>
<p>關於演員方面，我也不妨先來報告一下，﹁桃花村﹂的主角是麗琳哈蕙，（﹁龍翔鳳舞﹂的女主角，現在已經到好萊塢去了。）賈克霍爾勃，（就是﹁歡喜缘﹂中的主角）。</p>
<p>﹁春江花月夜﹂的主角是楊克蒲拉ＪanＫeipura,是歐洲男女老少所崇拜的一位歌壇泰斗。在上面所說的幾位演員中，祇有麗琳哈蕙和賈克霍爾勃，是我們所認識的，其餘的都還没有和上海人見過面，但是楊克蒲拉的歌喉和其他一切演員，將和這兩部片子一樣，在千萬影迷的腦筋中，留下一個很深的印象。</p>

<p>宣傳基督敎的悲劇</p>
<p>導演極妙　表演亦佳</p>
<p>當我們看過﹁十誡﹂或﹁萬王之王﹂之後，我們知道西席地密耳（ＣecilＢ·ＤeＭilles）是一個技巧純熟的資産階級的電影藝術家，同時也是一個最爲忠誠的基督敎徒。當然，任何一種宗敎，總有它的信徒，而這些信徒，也有不少的竭力爲其所信仰的宗敎而說敎。而且假如我們認定某種宗敎常被權威者所利用，而成爲一種统治的工具，那末這種﹁說敎﹂自有他的政治意義存在。</p>
<p>西席地密耳和﹁七重天﹂的導演葛雷菲士同樣，在他們的電影藝術的領域中，都有極大的成功，同時他們都企圖在﹁神﹂的﹁光輝﹂之下，來解釋現社會的衝突或矛盾，至少是以這種﹁心靈的感化﹂來使觀衆忘懷現實。所以，我們可以肯定的說，他們祇是技術的的成功，而他們的意識形態，却只能博得最少的一部份人們的讚美。</p>
<p>無疑義的，我們在這一部﹁ＴneＳignortheCloss﹂中正可找着最顯明的例證。封建勢力最高峯的羅馬王潮，也許是像本劇所描寫的那般荒淫，殘暴。他們在滿城的火熖中高歌，歡樂，他們或她們極度淫亂，他們以人民喂諸猛獸而引爲狂歡，他們在人民肉搏的慘酷中喝采，大笑。但是這人民是一羣山羊，他們在極度的淫威之下，只有屈服，不敢絲毫反抗，所謂一羣﹁博愛﹂﹁仁慈﹂的基督徒，只好在聖歌的嘹朗聲中而悲哀的就死很，顯然的，這裏僅是說明封建勢力的可怖，並不曾直接給與封建勢力任何輕微的抨擊，反之，甚至於是歌頌封建勢力的偉大的功勛。特别是爲了要穿揷成一個戀愛故事，而居然使一個王朝的大官爲了迷惑於女色，而和異己的基督徒欣然就義。眞是所謂妙想天開，不知其意義之所在。也許又是讚愛之﹁神聖﹂﹁偉大﹂吧。</p>
<p>但是導演的技巧，那眞是異常的成功。我們看罷，一切目前美國影片所必需的﹁肉感﹂，﹁猛獸﹂等都十全的運用進去，然而全不是勉强的穿揷，而都是本劇的重要部份，成爲劇情當然，開展。那種導演的手法，雖然（是他舊的方式，但是仍不失其完善的效力。假如我們要實例的說明，那末開頭時火熖中的王宫，衛隊長進奏時那個優美的鏡頭。當一幼年基督徒被捕之後，馬柯氏至女家敲門時，有意的緊張。王后和馬柯氏立於葡萄盆前言情。火阱中的呼聲。大批基督徒臨刑時的悲哀，而莊嚴的歌聲，以及那種自高瀉下的光線。其餘如莊嚴佈道場中的小孩的笑，以及臨刑時的無知的笑，而與老者相對寫，還有那女主角的痛哭，都是最能感人流涙的最好的場面。再於導演在劇中處處不忘十字架，當然是劇的中心，但也是非常生動的　　表演的純熟得當，當然是導演的指揮得力，但是幾個重角色的成就，我們是無論如何也得承認的。其他方面，都臻上乘，不必一一細說。</p>
<p>總之，這是一部在演出技巧上最爲成功的影片，在這一片中可以看出資産階級電影之特點，雖然我們不能忽視美國電影之歷史，及其一切製片條件之完備。然而在劇的用意上，都是和我們隔閡的，至少對於一般非基督敎徒，總不至於也能夠大爲﹁感化﹂。</p>
<p>最後我覺得這片名是萬萬不該譯爲﹁羅宫春色﹂的，因爲和片子的内容太不吻合，而且失了劇的重心，何况好的影片，决不是非﹁香艶﹂的題名，便不足以號召的吧。</p>

<p>— 心</p>
<p>恐怖窟，原名ＤoctorＸ，牠是去年度第一國家公司巨片之一。卡爾登登了一個多月的預告；終於在昨天公映了。　　在懂演出以前，有十個節目的舞台歌舞。</p>
<p>對於歌舞，我不便在這裏評什麽。不過我認爲這次﹁萬國歌舞團﹂的人選，雖然有幾個是上次﹁全美歌舞團﹂的演員，但是却比上兩次精彩。還有一點可以注意的，就是這次不偏重那些女人的大腿了。</p>
<p>﹁恐怖窟﹂的劇情，給我們的印象很是糢糊的。牠說月在正圓時，常有謀殺案發生。一位乂醫生和一位報館記者，極力設法想一探究竟。於是在乂醫生的試騐室裏，同時找了四位科學家，他認爲兇手是四個科學家之中的一個所作的。所以呌一個男僕和一個女僕，假扮殺案，打算用科學方法，測出兇手的心情和證據。他用的副手是一個殘廢人，第一夜，失敗了，内中一個科學家反被殺了。第二夜，因爲女僕患病，他呌他女兒代飾殺案角色，這時才發現了兇手便是那個殘廢的副手。此案由記者一力辦妥，乂醫生的女兒和記者結婚了。</p>
<p>這一個劇本的目的是呌人恐怖和顯示着科學的萬能。其中爲本有出乎人情以外的不合理；如乂醫生研究的動機，兇手殺人的原因等，都没有明白的解釋。　　全片中恐怖之處，實際上很少，而且出了偵探片的範圍。但種種困難，却十足的顯出導演的能幹，處處佈着驚人的疑陣。不過有時揭破太快，他目的雖在使人覺得滑稽，用笑聲來調劑緊張的空氣，可是實際上却有過於散漫鬆懈之嫌。内中小小晚節地方也不少，這在平常影片，不足引根遺憾，但在恐怖片裏，就顯得漏洞太大了。所以那導演在全部可以算成功，而局部却是失敗丨特别他不應當用滑稽方式，破壞了許多嚴重的恐怖性。</p>
<p>演員在大致上都可以說上乘。恐怖片裏根本也談不到内心表情，只有飾乂醫生女兒的茀華瑞ＦayＷray好一些，那扮報館記者的ＬeeＴracy簡直有負他已往的名譽；呌人感到討厭。</p>
<p>佈景平常。那些科學試騐室陳列，儀器很好，可以及得上﹁科學怪人﹂。光線也有良美成績，鏡頭上的工作，尚稱努力，分幕不錯，但也可以找出錯誤，如時間上的衝突等。對白似乎太多。發音太重，也失了恐怖的可能性。</p>

Subsequently, with the positions destroyed and nowhere to defend, they retreated to a certain city in Lengkou, relying on the dangers of the Great Wall to fight fiercely with the enemy again, repeatedly thwarting the enemy forces. The enemy found it disadvantageous to attack head-on, so they split up from the left and right wings at Liujiakou and Taipingzhai Pass, launching an all-out attack on us. Finally, due to our weak forces, the left and right wings were broken through by the enemy. Lengkou was surrounded from the front and could not be defended, so it was abandoned.

(4) The Hunan army has arrived in Ji'an and Jishui, and the Fujian and Guangdong armies are also advancing. They will arrive at their designated locations in the near future.

<p>New Delhi Today, when the Commercial Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, William, moved a motion in the Legislative Assembly to consider a bill to counter dumping, he declared that the Indian government had taken steps to cancel the 1905 India-Japan Agreement. Today, the Indian government sent an official document to Japan stating that most-favored-nation treatment would be abolished in six months. William declared that the Indian government's step was not out of ill will towards any country, but a completely self-defense plan to alleviate special circumstances, such as currency devaluation, dumping of goods at low prices, etc., all of which would undermine India's industry, etc. (11th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>New Delhi The Legislative Assembly today passed the Anti-Dumping Bill. The bill authorizes the Indian government to levy import duties on excessively cheap foreign goods that could harm the survival of any industry in India, in order to counter them.

A notice of increased tariffs will be submitted to the Legislative Assembly for approval within two months. The bill will be effective until December 31, 1935. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today received official reports that British Foreign Secretary Simon had sent a six-month note yesterday to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, stating that he intended to cancel the agreement in accordance with Article 4 of the 1904 Japan-India Commercial Treaty. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs elaborated on Britain's move, saying that it was not unexpected, as the British government obviously wanted to open the way for India to pass the Anti-Dumping Law and abolish the most-favored-nation treatment. He also said that Japan would probably try to devise other methods to prevent Japanese commerce with India from being overly shocked, but on the one hand, since it was felt that the existing agreement had to be canceled, it would probably not be easy to negotiate a new agreement.

<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Ambassador Matsudaira in Britain to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, British Foreign Secretary Sir Simon had notified Ambassador Matsudaira that the Japan-India Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1904 would expire on October 1st of this year, in order to allow India to break away from the most-favored-nation clause and prevent the dumping of Japanese goods in India.

<p>(Tokyo) The abrogation of the Japan-India Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has had a great impact on the Japanese cotton industry. Countermeasures are currently being discussed. If the treaty is abrogated, there is a possibility of increased dumping taxes, and after the abrogation notice, after six months, it will be treated as a country without a treaty, and goods from other countries can be taxed at different rates. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the attitude of the Indian government after six months, but at least it will inevitably impose a currency dumping tax. Therefore, textile manufacturers are paying close attention to the tax rate. In addition, the Textile Industry Federation will convene a committee meeting to discuss countermeasures. However, the expansion of the shortening rate after July is inevitable, so before the expiration of the current shortening work period, the current shortening work rate of 27.6% will be further expanded. Some opinions also believe that the issue should be submitted to the World Economic Conference. (12th Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram this morning from Ambassador Matsudaira in Britain, reporting on India's cancellation of the India-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and immediately held a departmental meeting to study countermeasures. It is heard that the following policies have been decided: (1) Trade between Japan and India is gradually becoming closer. At this time, India suddenly cancels the most-favored-nation clause and imposes dumping taxes on Japanese goods. The Japanese government feels very sorry. Not only is it detrimental to the interests of trade between the two countries, but it also deeply hopes that the British government can reconsider the relationship between Japan and Britain. (2) Textile yarn, cotton cloth, and sundries may conflict with the British and Indian industries. It is hoped that the British and Indian governments will still grant most-favored-nation treatment to other commodities that have no impact, such as cement. (3) Sudden changes in tariffs will cause great losses in trade. It is sincerely hoped that the British and Indian governments can adopt a gradual policy. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Ambassador Matsudaira with the above countermeasures, instructing him to earnestly contact the British Foreign Secretary. (12th China United Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese economic community was very panicked when it received news of India's cancellation of the India-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, believing that it was the result of the Lancashire cotton yarn industry's strong opposition. After the September 18th Incident, Japanese goods were boycotted in China, and they sought a way out in the South Seas and India, adopting a dumping policy. In India, they competed with British goods. British-produced cotton yarn, cloth, and sundries were defeated. In order to save its domestic industry, the British government cancelled the India-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation to prevent its dumping policy. The following is a list of the status of Japanese goods in India last year:</p>

<h3 id="e36">Letter on Internal Pacification and External Resistance <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Our country's national crisis today is becoming increasingly urgent. Externally, the Japanese army is approaching the Great Wall. After the fall of Rehe, eastern Luan is extremely critical. Duolun and Zhangjiakou are also under threat. The Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Koiso Kuniaki, was recently ordered by Mutō to return to Japan. His primary mission is to discuss how to deal with the Middle Eastern Railway issue, and the eagerness to invade Zhangjiakou and Duolun has already become apparent. Internally, the communist bandits are rampant. They have emerged from their old nests and are attempting to expand their area of disturbance. Furthermore, due to the interwoven mountains and rivers of Jiangxi, they can appear and disappear unpredictably. The brave and battle-hardened national army often finds it difficult to cope. Therefore, "internal pacification and external resistance" has now become a particularly important issue. Which should come first should be decided definitively. Now, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission has clearly declared the strategy of prioritizing internal pacification before external resistance. If the general officers can muster their courage and follow the exhortations of Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, prioritizing the work of "internal pacification" and eliminating the communist bandits in the shortest possible time, establishing general order, and ensuring that the people have food and clothing and can live in peace, then the prospects for resistance against Japan will be greatly improved.</p>
<p>Our country was originally known as an agricultural nation, but the decline of the countryside is worsening year by year. In European and American countries, due to the development of their industries and the expansion of overseas markets, their industries have been able to absorb their surplus population and absorb the floating elements of the countryside, barely maintaining the balance of their society. However, since the outbreak of the world economic crisis, both domestic and foreign markets have felt constricted. The unemployed masses are increasing. Resource-rich countries such as the United States of America are finding it difficult to cope. Skilled nations such as Germany are even resorting to desperate measures. As for Japan, the non-productive nature of military supplies is stimulating the exhausted state of industry in order to absorb surplus production. In this environment, our country's only strategy for absorbing the surplus rural population is to send them abroad to work as coolies in the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, or to enlist them as soldiers in the interior. The number of reserve workers absorbed by modern cities is ultimately limited. As a result, the national strength is weakening, the national economy is declining, and society is becoming increasingly unstable. At the same time, urban industry and commerce are being fundamentally shaken by the collapse of the rural economy, to the point where they are almost unable to maintain themselves. If this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable. Internal pacification is truly the most urgent issue today.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that the authorities will pay attention to the following two points in addition to military action for internal pacification:</p>
<p>First, the stabilization of the people's livelihoods. The majority of our people are on the verge of starvation, from prosperous metropolises to remote villages. Corpses of the starving are seen everywhere, and the unemployed are in droves. Therefore, the first priority of internal pacification must be to open up avenues for the people to survive, so that everyone can use their talents to sustain their lives and contribute their remaining strength to the state and society. It is not easy to make those who have already left agricultural production return to farming (because agriculture is extremely hard work, and even if they return, there may not be land available for cultivation). However, the extra burden on the countryside should be reduced or eliminated, and the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies should be abolished. This cannot be delayed any longer. As for regulating the rural economy, so that farmers are not subject to high-interest exploitation, and reorganizing existing land, so that land is used to its full potential, then a lopsided society will have a chance to recover, and the prosperity of the cities will have a foundation. The plan for "internal pacification" can then be initially implemented.</p>
<p>Second, the enlightenment of politics. In recent years, active political measures have not been given much attention. Even the minimally required clean government has become the highest ideal. As a result, there are more times of political depression and fewer times of bright hope. The minimum political standards, such as enlightened and clean government, that have already been achieved in European and American democratic countries should be immediately sought to be realized. Our country has a vast territory, and it is truly not easy to achieve immediate results. If county magistrates can be strictly selected and local autonomy can be established, then political clarity can also be expected to be realized.</p>
<p>The above two points, although very brief, are in fact the most urgent tasks for the current "internal pacification." It is necessary to stabilize the people's livelihoods and enlighten politics, and then it will be possible to win the hearts of the people throughout the country and mend the internal and external troubles. This is how it should be in theory.</p>

<p>Secretly Deploying Troops to Various Key Points</p>
<p>Ordering the Puppet Ministry of Communications to Issue a Final Protest</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Continues to Send Goods Trains</p>
<p>Relations Between Japan and Russia Become Increasingly Tense</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese Kwantung Army has decided to forcibly seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. Division Commander Hirose, under the orders of Commander Mutō, secretly deployed the troops of Toyama late at night on the 10th, dispatching them to various key military points. The puppet Railway Protection Army was also ordered to move to various places, seeking opportunities to forcibly remove Soviet railway service personnel and seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, which would then be operated by the South Manchuria Railway Company. (United Chinese News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Commander of the Kwantung Army today ordered the puppet Ministry of Communications to issue a final protest to the Soviet government, demanding that the Soviet Union return all 83 locomotives, 190 passenger cars, and 3,200 freight cars, totaling 3,473, within one month, or else resort to necessary military action. The South Manchuria Railway Company has newly established a Railway Branch Office in Harbin, with the intention of planning to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway by force. As a result, relations between Japan and Russia are becoming increasingly dangerous. (United Chinese News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to Japanese newspapers here, the Soviet government in Manchuria once again detained 217 freight cars on the morning of the 10th, guarding against the Japanese side using them to transport military supplies. As a result, the Japanese side is increasingly angered by the Soviet Union. The Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway visited the puppet Ministry of Communications this morning, requesting that the puppet organization not be used by the Japanese to disrupt international transportation. (United Chinese News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese organ, the Harbin Times, published an editorial today entitled "Soviet Russia is Naturally Preparing for War," stating that if Soviet Russia were not preparing for war, its bizarre policies would be inexplicable. The locomotives and freight cars seized by Soviet Russia all belong to the Chinese Eastern Railway. More than half of the vehicles owned by the Chinese Eastern Railway have been moved into Russian territory, and the method of removal is tantamount to systematic theft. The Soviet Union's claim that the locomotives were purchased by the Kerensky government and therefore belong to the Soviet government is baseless. If their claim were true, why did the Russian government not move these locomotives into Russian territory years ago? The Soviet Union's explanation proves the Soviet Union's lack of justification and the blatant lies of the Russian authorities. Various contracts clearly prove that the vehicles moved into Russian territory are owned by the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Chinese Eastern Railway is a joint venture between Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo," so any decision related to this railway must be approved by "Manchukuo." Soviet Russia should express its apology for taking without permission, rather than raising the issue of vehicle ownership. The Soviet Union has no choice but to steal vehicles and whitewash its behavior. Speculating on its intentions, can it be said that it is not intentionally preparing for war against Japan, but secretly trying to improve the transport of the absolutely damaged Siberian Railway? "Manchukuo" has repeatedly protested against the removal of vehicles from the Chinese Eastern Railway and suspended traffic, but although Japan and "Manchukuo" are committed to peace with Russia, Soviet Russia has always been preparing for war. Therefore, "Manchukuo's" protests are likely to be ineffective. Japan and "Manchukuo" have no choice but to take the same actions as Soviet Russia. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Soviet representative of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Kessler Ziv, told the representative of Manchukuo (puppet) in Harbin on the afternoon of the 10th that the Manchurian (puppet) side's closure of the railway in Manchuria was illegal, and issued the following protest. The main points of the protest are that the Manchukuo (puppet) officials have closed the junction of the Chabeka and the Middle Eastern Railways, which is an illegal act that hinders international transportation. Please lift the blockade as soon as possible and seek a peaceful resolution. Manchukuo (puppet) issued the following counterattack to this protest, the gist of which is that Manchukuo (puppet) is using its strength to block the connection between the two railways to suppress the illegal actions of the Soviet side and to establish the original mission of the Chinese Eastern Railway's joint operation by Russia and Manchuria, and to promote the Soviet Union's reflection. As for the reason for obstructing this transportation, the responsibility lies with the Soviet Union due to its illegal actions. Manchuria (puppet) is by no means a troublemaker. If the Soviet Union realizes its mistakes and returns the detained vehicles, showing the reality of its reflection, then a peaceful resolution can be established. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Although the officials of Manchukuo (puppet) are doing their best to prevent the Soviet side from carrying freight cars away from the two lines in the Middle East, the Soviet Union took advantage of the lack of border blockade and sent away 70 freight cars on the 8th and 9th, so Manchukuo buried sleepers on the railroad at the junction on the 10th, and resolutely carried out a serious blockade. (Telecommunications dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The representative of the Chinese Eastern Railway (puppet) of Manchukuo, Li Shaogeng, today sent a final notice with a deadline to the representative of the Soviet Union, Kuznesov, as follows: I hope that 83 locomotives, 19 passenger cars, and 3,200 freight cars belonging to the Chinese Eastern Railway that were transported to Soviet Russia will be returned within one month.

<p>Enshrined at Baotong Temple for Scheduled State Funeral</p>
<p>(Hankou) At 8:30 AM on the 12th, the coffins of the late President Li and Madame Wu arrived at Dazhimen from Liujiamiao. Tens of thousands of people from all walks of life came to greet them. At 9:00 AM, the hearse followed the predetermined route, passing through Zhongshan Road and Minquan Road in the French Concession to the wharf. Tens of thousands of mourners, mostly civilians, followed by military and political figures, held funeral streamers. Hundreds of roadside altars were set up along the way. At noon, the coffin was transported across the river by boat, and the navy fired salutes in tribute. When the boat docked at the Dadi Kou in Wuchang, Xia Douyin led all members of the provincial government to greet and pay their respects on the shore. The ceremony was extremely grand. Then, passing through Changjie in front of the provincial government, Xia Douyin again paid his respects alone. When passing Yema Factory, the provincial party headquarters also greeted and paid their respects. At 3:00 PM, it was transported to Hongshan and arrived at 4:00 PM. It was enshrined in Baotong Temple, awaiting the scheduled state funeral and public memorial service. The weather was clear that day, and the streets and lanes were crowded with onlookers, but the order was orderly. The mourners traveled twenty miles back and forth from Hankou to Hongshan without showing any fatigue, which is a testament to the depth of his cherished memory. In particular, a group of wounded soldiers who started the uprising, with broken hands and feet and blind eyes, was the most touching and moving. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) When Li's coffin arrived in Hankou on the 12th, the British, Japanese, and German consuls-general and representatives of the French and American consuls were at the station to greet them.

<p>(Beiping) Former Japanese Foreign Minister Aizawa arrived in Beiping yesterday afternoon. Today, he told a Reuters reporter that his visit to China was entirely a private affair with no political relationship and that the sole purpose was to conduct an on-site investigation to understand the state of the general situation. He believes that the time for direct negotiations is not yet ripe. In his opinion, the general public opinion and public sentiment of both countries do not allow for the opportunity for direct negotiations. Later, when the Reuters reporter asked him when he would consider it ripe, he said, "This kind of opportunity will definitely come one day, but I cannot predict it." Aizawa also said that he had met with Chinese people in Shanghai, but he did not want to meet with Chinese leaders because this would make things difficult for them. He also attended a banquet for famous Chinese people in Beiping, but no political affairs were discussed at the dinner. When the issue of the mandated islands was discussed, he resolutely said that Japan would protect them no matter what. The Japanese Embassy will hold a banquet tonight to welcome Aizawa.

The rapid loss of the four northeastern provinces was a manifestation of the people's dissatisfaction with the politics of Zhang Xueliang, Tang Yulin, and others. Now that Zhang has gone abroad and Tang has disappeared, the people of the Northeast are planning to fight for their motherland and resist Japan. The Central Committee should take advantage of this opportunity to send high-ranking officials to comfort the people, while summoning the various rebel armies and striving to unite them to strengthen their momentum. Wang expressed his agreement with this, but the specific measures would be decided by the Central Committee. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>The U.S. Is Prepared to First Remove Tariff Barriers to Advocate for All Countries</p>
<p>The Japanese Government Decides to Appoint Viscount Ishii as Representative</p>
<p>(London) News received tonight: President Roosevelt invited the British Prime Minister to Washington, D.C. with the following words: "Please come and stay with me for a week. I believe that in this week, we can do more for God than we have done before." It is now known that the upcoming talks will be a free exchange of opinions, and the scope of the talks will be extremely broad, including the entire war debt issue, the date of the World Economic Conference, tariff policy issues, international exchange rates, world trade, methods of cooperation in the League of Nations disarmament conference, and the general situation in Europe, all of which will be discussed. The purpose of this meeting is only to exchange opinions and not to make any agreements. The result of this talk will be to promote closer cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States. It is now believed that British Prime Minister MacDonald will not allow British war debts to become an international issue of even greater scope. What is being discussed now is only a general discussion of the war debt issue. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(New York) General opinion is that the upcoming international talks in Washington, D.C. will be sufficient to promote the United States to abandon its isolationist policy adopted for the past eight years. According to Secretary of State Hull, the purpose of the Washington talks is only to prepare for the World Economic Conference. President Roosevelt will request full authority from Congress to negotiate treaties with various countries. Hull and British Ambassador Lindsay both believe that stabilizing currency prices, using more silver coins, and limiting silver production are all urgent tasks. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Japan Seeks to Ease Anti-American Sentiment: Ishii Chosen as Representative <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Kōsai Uchida entered the Imperial Palace at 10:00 AM this morning to meet with the Emperor and report on the circumstances of participating in the World Economic Conference. He left the Imperial Palace at 11:00 AM and immediately telegraphed Ambassador Debuchi to reply to the U.S. State Department. After consultation between Uchida and Saitō, the Japanese representative was decided to be Kikujirō Ishii, emphasizing the easing of Japanese-American sentiment, with the goal of having the United States recognize Japan's Far Eastern policy. Therefore, a veteran of the diplomatic community was appointed to this position, and economic and financial experts were appointed as his advisors. Masatake Yamaguchi, Secretary-General of the Seiyūkai, commented: "Ishii is undoubtedly an elder statesman of the diplomatic community, but the purpose of this meeting is financial and economic. It is unknown how much specialized knowledge Ishii actually has. To achieve the desired goals of this conference, the position of advisor is very important." Minseitō Secretary-General Matsuda commented that Takahashi, Yamamoto, Wakatsuki, and Shidehara can no longer participate, and there is no one more suitable than Ishii. Although this meeting emphasizes economics, from Japan's standpoint, it should focus on U.S.-Japan diplomatic relations, taking the opportunity to develop friendly relations between the two countries, break through the deadlock in the Pacific issue, and make the recognition of Japan's status in the Far East by the United States the most important task. (China United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ishii will represent the Japanese government at the talks on international issues in Washington, D.C. After the Washington discussions are completed, Ishii will go to London to participate in the World Economic Conference. Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira is expected to be the overall Japanese representative at the conference. Since Ishii is a politician rather than an economic expert, his appointment as Japanese representative proves that Japan's concern for the Washington talks is more political than economic. Ishii has served as Japanese Foreign Minister, Ambassador to the United States, Ambassador to France, and Chief Representative to the League of Nations, and is now sixty-seven years old.

<p>(Washington) Today, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced that the State Department's request for legislation to prevent the publication of secret diplomatic documents and to protect the U.S. diplomatic secret codes is solely intended to prevent Yatterley from publishing his newly compiled book on Japanese diplomatic secrets, so as not to hinder U.S.-Japan friendship.

<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated today that President Roosevelt will begin negotiating to lower tariffs worldwide before convening an economic conference in London, and will ask Congress to first lower U.S. tariffs before that day to show good faith. Legislation is currently being drafted to be submitted to Congress, and in addition to generally reducing tariffs, the President also plans to seek smoother international trade through reciprocal agreements. In addition, Hull freely expressed his personal opinions on the tariff issue, saying that the current thirteen million unemployed men and women are sufficient proof that unprecedented high tariffs cannot protect U.S. industry. The Republican argument that striving to lower tariffs will flood the U.S. market with foreign goods has become an outdated concept. It must be understood that the basis of international trade lies entirely in mutually beneficial exchange of goods, but high tariffs everywhere make this kind of exchange impossible. Therefore, for its own sake, the United States should immediately lower tariffs, and it is expected that today's Democratic Congress will undoubtedly reduce them quickly.

<p>(Washington) Regarding the war debt issue, the State Department today stated that it could not apply a universal approach and made no other comments. However, according to those close to the government, the plan that the United States will propose to the major countries is so broad in nature that the President will ask Congress to authorize all substantive contributions to war debts. It is expected that when the President requests authorization to conclude reciprocal tariff agreements, he will also request the power to reorganize or modify the war debt repayment procedures. Moreover, a certain economic expert who often contributes opinions to the government now believes that war debts and trade will be considered simultaneously in the Washington talks. Several members of Congress also believe that if the President can advocate for a reasonable international purchase of silver to stabilize silver prices, then a majority in Congress will be happy to agree to authorize the President to adjust war debts. It was also heard today that several Democratic leaders in the Senate are planning to first pass a resolution through Congress to advise the President to take certain steps regarding war debts, so as to avoid the President having to request special privileges.

<p>(Washington) Today, several parties pointed out that the U.S. State Department has made a mistake in the way it invited other countries to discuss economic war debt issues. According to reliable sources, the Little Entente and Poland felt slighted because the United States did not invite them to send special representatives. The feelings of Poland and Czechoslovakia were particularly deep. Today, their ambassadors to the United States went to the State Department to inquire when they could negotiate, but the State Department replied that the United States would be happy to discuss trade and currency issues through normal diplomatic channels, but would not invite special envoys to be sent. This reply quickly spread to other embassies, and Belgium, Romania, and Yugoslavia were all deeply disappointed. However, it is expected that after hearing the replies received by the Polish and Czech ambassadors, they may not go to the State Department to inquire again. Although this discussion mainly focuses on economic issues, it is said that war debts will also be discussed separately with representatives from various countries. The smaller countries of Europe are deeply concerned that after the United States has agreed on a war debt solution with the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, it will attempt to apply the same approach to smaller debtor countries, so they all want to be invited to talk in order to avoid this move. (National Telegraph, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull issued a statement regarding the future economic talks, saying that the U.S. government invited a small number of countries, treating them equally, according to a precise plan. We want to consult with the representatives of the invited countries separately, and the representatives of the uninvited countries in Washington will also be treated with the same sincere attitude. Previously, foreign representatives here believed that the upcoming preliminary talks were extremely important internationally, and they were quite surprised that their countries had not been invited. It was said that for the World Economic Conference to succeed, several countries should have the opportunity to speak during the preliminary talks. For example, it would be beneficial to consult Czechoslovakia on tariff issues and Romania on wheat and kerosene issues. Therefore, the State Department announced the above declaration to comfort the Little Entente and other uninvited countries, fearing that the number of representatives would be too large and the talks would turn into a conference, making President Roosevelt's proposal difficult to succeed, so only a small number of countries were invited.

<p>New York The "Current Affairs" magazine, published in Washington, D.C., is known for its well-informed sources.

Matsuoka told the new U.S. Secretary of State Hull that if the United States recognizes the Soviet Union, public opinion in Japan will regard it as an action against Japan. In addition, it is noteworthy that the "Washington Post" published a message when Matsuoka was in Washington, D.C., saying that the recognition of the Soviet Union in Japan would be interpreted as proof of a secret agreement between the U.S. and Russia to jointly deal with Japan, resulting in either Japan launching an attack on the Soviet Union or a breakdown in U.S.-Japan relations, or even both occurring simultaneously.

Efforts are now being made to make its wording compliant with French reservations. It is reported that Mussolini does not insist on the wording of the pact, as long as the spirit of maintaining peace is preserved. France has raised some reservations, especially regarding Poland and the Little Entente, and insists that it cannot force small countries to comply with the text. After repeated talks between Mussolini and the representatives of the three countries, an understanding has been reached on several key points of the pact, such as Germany's restoration of armaments and revision of the treaty. As for all the detailed provisions, they will be gradually drafted, but Mussolini is confident that full and satisfactory agreement can ultimately be obtained.</p>

The Holy See has signed Concordats with Prussia, Bavaria, and Baden, which cover the largest part of the Catholic population in Germany. The difficulty in the past in the Holy See not being able to sign a Concordat with the federal government was due to the inability of the legislative bodies of the various states to agree. Now that Germany has changed to a centralized system, it is convenient to conclude a Concordat.

<p>Accusation Read in Court in Russian</p>
<p>Accused of Counter-Revolutionary Sabotage</p>
<p>Reuter, Moscow, 12th -- The trial of six engineers from the Vickers Company opened this afternoon. The courtroom was very crowded with spectators. Before the clock struck twelve, five English defendants were brought into court, placed in the dock, guarded by two Red Army soldiers. Soon after, the sixth Englishman, MacDonald, also joined them, his beard long and his eyes sunken. The Russian defendants, except for one who was ill, also entered the dock one after another. A platform was placed in the courtroom, covered with red cloth, guarded by more than ten soldiers. Seated on the platform were officials, lawyers, and journalists. The judge entered the courtroom in plain clothes, and everyone stood up. The presiding judge then opened the court and asked the defendants about their age, occupation, and nationality. MacDonald's answers were very faint and almost inaudible. The court clerk, carrying a large number of case files, read the indictment into the microphone. The defendants were allowed to sit down while it was being read. At the same time, troops patrolled the streets outside the courthouse to prevent public gatherings. The reading of the Soviet Russian indictment took a long time. It began by mentioning the counter-revolutionary activities of saboteurs in the electrical plants, accusing the saboteurs of (1) destroying the electrical plants in order to ruin Soviet industry and weaken the Soviet state, (2) collecting and using secret important military and civilian information to hinder the Soviet Union, and (3) bribing employees of the electrical plants to carry out their counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. A special Soviet expert committee reported that the failures of the electrical plants were due either to criminal negligence or to deliberate sabotage, one or the other. The indictment made the following accusations against the six English defendants: (1) Vickers Company engineer Gregory belonged to a counter-revolutionary sabotage party, engaged in economic, military, and civilian espionage, and passed the information he obtained to Thornton. (2) Krushni belonged to a sabotage party and, in his capacity as an installation engineer, engaged in systematic economic and military espionage. At the Yakou Electrical Plant, he arranged for sabotage activities, deliberately misinstalling electrical machinery, causing the plant to fail, and systematically bribing Russian engineers and workers to commit espionage and sabotage. (3) MacDonald, in his capacity as an installation engineer, participated in sabotage activities at the Slatoust and Zugres electrical plants, followed Thornton's instructions, collected much secret military information, investigated the production of armaments and ammunition, and instructed Russian engineers to commit sabotage, resulting in repeated damage to the electrical plants. The amount of his bribes totaled 10,000 rubles. (4) Vickers Company's Russian manager, Monkhouse, belonged to a counter-revolutionary party with the following counter-revolutionary aims: (a) collecting secret military and civilian information, (b) participating in sabotage activities, (c) bribing two Russian engineers to reward them for their espionage and sabotage activities, and (d) bribing Russian engineers to conceal defects in the installed machinery. (5) Vickers engineer Nordwall belonged to a counter-revolutionary party, instructed workers to sabotage the electrical plant during the installation of machinery at Ivgres, and bribed workers 5,000 rubles to conceal defects in the Vickers Company's installation. (6) Thornton, Monkhouse's chief assistant, also belonged to a counter-revolutionary party, engaged in espionage on technical, military, and civilian matters, and ordered his subordinates MacDonald and Krushni, as well as many Russian engineers and workers, to carry out sabotage activities at several electrical plants. He also bribed engineers and workers to commit espionage, sabotage, and conceal defects in the installed machinery. The events described by the prosecutor began in 1927 and ended in 1932. Twelve Russian employees of the Vickers Company, including the female secretary Kadusov, were also among those accused. The evidence included confessions obtained by the political police from Russian employees under duress. The indictment also stated that MacDonald had confessed to his crimes, but the other Englishmen completely denied the charges, admitting only to minor gifts to Russian engineers and workers, occasional defects in machinery that had been repaired, and collecting information beneficial to the Vickers Company. After the indictment was read, MacDonald and the twelve Russian defendants pleaded guilty, but the other five Englishmen pleaded not guilty.</p>
<h3 id="e86">MacDonald Confesses, Startling the Entire Courtroom <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>National, Moscow, 12th -- When the trial of six British Vickers Company engineers accused of espionage, sabotage, and bribery opened this afternoon in the Moscow Trade Union Hall, the defendant MacDonald confessed to the crime of sabotage. This action was completely unexpected, and when announced, the entire courtroom was shocked and order was disrupted. In addition, eleven Russian accomplices, including one woman, also confessed to their crimes. However, the remaining British engineers, Monkhouse, Thornton, Krushni, Nordwall, and Gregory, all pleaded not guilty. Today, Soviet officials, diplomats, and journalists were present to observe the trial, so when it opened at 12:05, the audience was already full. First, the prosecutor read the indictment, which was eighty pages long and detailed MacDonald's confession during the Russian officials' investigation of the case regarding the sabotage of power plants. It was stated that MacDonald confessed that his goal was to hinder the manufacture of Soviet military materials, and his plan was to destroy power plants in wartime. He had told Russian engineers, such as Gusev, about this conspiracy. As for the Russian woman, Kutuzova, who worked as a secretary for Vickers Company, she was accused of giving bribes to another Russian man, Ulenik, who was also a Russian employee of Vickers Company, and was accused of accepting bribes and sabotage. At 3:30, after the indictment was read, the court adjourned and reconvened at 6:00 PM. The British Chargé d'Affaires, Sterling, and other members of the British Embassy were also present to observe the trial.</p>

<p>Reuter, London, 11th -- As the trial of six British engineers in Moscow was about to begin, the British House of Lords unanimously passed the third reading of the bill prohibiting the import of Russian goods. Secretary of War Hailsham stated that the Vickers Electrical Company had a commercial relationship with the Soviet Union for many years, and the company currently had uncompleted contracts worth 1.5 million pounds, so it was in the company's interest to be friendly with the Russian government. He also stated that the British Ambassador to Russia had visited the detainees and was surprised that the British engineers were so frightened after being imprisoned for three days that they dared not speak. If three days could have such an effect on Englishmen or Scotsmen, then one could imagine the influence of Russian prisons. The British government sincerely hoped that it would not be necessary to exercise the power of this bill, but the government was determined to do everything possible to secure justice for the British citizens in Moscow. Former Colonial Secretary Passfield criticized the bill but welcomed the government's statement that it would not use the power of the bill except to protect the six engineers.</p>

<p>TASS, Moscow, 12th -- The Soviet government newspaper "Izvestia" today, in an editorial, compared the British government's different attitudes towards the detention of British nationals in Germany and the Soviet Union. The British government's attitude towards the German authorities' detention of British national Fraser can be seen in Simon's reply to a question in the House of Commons on April 10. At that time, Simon only said that Fraser was accused of preparing to commit a major espionage crime and that diplomatic channels would be used to inquire about the details of the charges. The newspaper said that when the Soviet authorities detained several British citizens, the charges against them had already been published in the newspapers. When a British national was detained by the German fascists, he was only accused of the vague charge of preparing to commit a major espionage crime. What was the British Foreign Office's response to these two cases? The Soviet accusations were dismissed as baseless before they were even published, while the German fascists seemed to be trusted. The Soviet detention of British nationals provoked immediate protests and threats, but the British Foreign Secretary considered protesting the German detention of British nationals to be meddling. What can be seen here is that the British Foreign Office is applying two different means and strategies to the Soviet Union and fascist Germany. Of course, we do not want to urge Britain to take any kind of measures against Germany. What we are concerned with is that the anti-Soviet movement related to the case of the Vickers Company employees being accused and the means that the British government wants to take in this case are clearly inconsistent with the interests of the British defendants in this case. The British government is only obeying the wishes of the anti-Soviets and wants to use this case to destroy British-Soviet commercial relations and embark on a path of open anti-Soviet policy.</p>

<p>"Going to the front line to report the news!"</p>
<p>I boarded the train with such impassioned emotions, bid farewell to my beloved Shanghai. A long snake-like train rushed forward through the dawn wind and morning mist. My wife, watching me leave her, gradually receding into the distance, her eyes immediately turned red. I knew that she was feeling bitter inside, but you should not be sad at my departure to the front line, you woman are truly weak.</p>
<p>Iron wheels raced across the green fields, passing through those beautiful little villages. My head was pressed tightly against the train window, gazing at the countryside on all sides, while in my heart, I was echoing the emotions of last year's January 28th Incident. But what have those iron-willed national warriors of ours, and those nameless heroes who died for the defense war, left behind here? The blood-stained trenches and the beehives under the enemy's bombs have already faded into a misty blur. In the embrace of this maiden-like spring, aren't the pink peach blossoms still smiling in the spring breeze? The train passed Huangdu and quickly arrived at Qingyang Port. The bridge at Qingyang Port gave me a very brief but painful memory. The train slowly crawled across the iron bridge, and I saw Kunshan and the upright tower body. The wheel of time has already destroyed the shadows of sorrow, misery, and grief. The pagodas of Suzhou and the pagodas of Wuxi are both "standing at attention" unharmed in the spring breeze. Isn't this how the beauty of Jiangnan is expressed? The Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang overlooks the sails in the river. On the moist yellow soil cliff, those coolies' huts still occupy the land. I saw this reality of heaven and hell, and I could only sit down in silence and light a cigarette, using the wisps of smoke to blur my own sentimentality.</p>
<p>When I saw the majestic and solemn Nanjing city walls through the train window, suddenly the gentle sky scattered a light-footed breeze, treading on the green fields, slowly playing the tune of "Spring Will Not Last Long." On the ridge, new graves covered with yellow earth, crouched the "magpie" with its black and white flowers intermingled. It lived naturally on the earth, but as I looked at this tender green after Qingming, and looked north towards the beacon fires of my homeland, the fathers and elders under the iron hooves, then I only felt a sourness in my nose.</p>
<p>The connecting train continued to Nanjing riverside at five o'clock in the afternoon. Many passengers crossing the river crowded onto the ferry. Looking south at Lion Mountain, looking east at the rolling waves of the river, this is the territory of the great Republic of China, but the foreign warships parked in the heart of the river proudly raised the flags of imperialism. Our toy-like small gunboats, so small, lay down in front of those huge foreign warships, but the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth was also fluttering on the bow.</p>
<p>The scene at Pukou felt almost the same as the scene at dusk. In the ticket office, many gray soldiers were still sleeping. On the cold and deserted platform, a blue steel train ready to go straight to Beiping was parked. Military police and police officers, plus a few scattered dozens of passengers, decorated the large Pukou Railway Station.</p>
<p>There were twenty or so people in the Red Swastika Society's ambulance team, also heading north on this train. They were working hard to fulfill their national obligations, so they did not linger on the spring colors of Jiangnan, and were willing to step on the road of resisting Japan. Furthermore, they were willing to drop their stretchers and take up guns. Then, can China be guaranteed not to perish? I was too hasty and did not ask in detail where they came from, and who initiated and organized them, but I dare to say one thing, they are Chinese. They have clearly recognized the gravity of the fact that national demise is imminent. They are organized by their passion and conscience. In my heart, I express my respect to them.</p>
<p>Xuzhou was still surrounded by sand and soil. Because it was early in the morning, the scene at the station, apart from some hawkers wearing blue cloth cotton jackets, was gray soldiers. A very sharp morning wind was blowing at the station. The green in the fields was similar to that in Jiangnan, but the intoxicating spring breeze could not be found here. Soon the train leaped again towards the vast plains of the north.</p>
<p>The sunlight shone very softly on the earth. The fields on the plains were neatly arranged with green velvet-like wheat fields. The mountains in the distance showed their tall and majestic appearance, flying in the hazy clouds. The gentle outline of the mountains of Jiangnan could not be seen here. The neat villages, and the faces of those Shandong farmers full of antique flavor, as well as the little-footed women, wearing blue cloth clothes and pink ribbons wrapped around their feet. In these expressions, the Shandong people are the great ones under the wheel of time.</p>
<p>I looked out the train window, as if I was very concerned about these Shandong folks. I witnessed the present situation of being well-fed and warmly clothed, and swept away all the impressions of Shandong's crying hunger and displacement in my mind from five or six years ago. Especially when the train arrived at Zhangxia Station, the beautiful mountain bay to the west, with thousands and hundreds of houses, snow-white pear blossoms, and tender willows blown open by the spring breeze, I really missed this beautiful Zhangxia Bay. Moreover, the Shandong tea room said to me, "Sir, this place is really beautiful. Peaches and pears are produced especially abundantly every year. The railway bureau really needs to take out money to build it a little. Then, rich people can also come to play." He said this, and I only nodded, admitting that he was right. 民房 near Sanyingtun destroyed by enemy aircraft (Central News Agency photo)</p>
<p>The city walls of Yanzhou were becoming more incomplete day by day. Our train entered the station at twelve o'clock. Needless to say, the oily smoked chicken was being shouted by the Shandong folks. There were many soldiers on the station platform, all taking off their upper military clothes, white sweat vests, very neatly all the same white, filling the road there. Red and black faces dripping with sweat. I took a picture against the wooden fence of this powerful expression, turned around and said to the policeman at the station, "Whose team is this, so neatly organized?" "This is Lao Han's team," he replied in a tone of certainty. It seemed like he looked closely again. The armed soldiers at the station seemed to have very neat clothes, and the guns were also good, mostly "Czech style." The appearance of each soldier was somewhat attractive. "Well, this kind of army is indeed not bad, no wonder Song Zheyuan's big knife team made a splash at Xifengkou." I thought so in my heart when the train started.</p>

<p>The train arrived in Jinan at 6:20 PM. The weather immediately cooled down, with gusts of cold wind blowing. Indeed, people who are used to living in Jiangnan, coming out of the warm embrace, suddenly encountering this cold force, really feel a little trembling. I patrolled the station and felt that this Jinan station, which is quite well-built, can be counted as one of the best in North China. The best impression was that there was not a single idle soldier wandering around the station. Except for a dozen or so soldiers on duty, I simply looked around for a long time and couldn't find one. The platform was also cleaned, and everything was very orderly. When the train started, I was again pondering this relatively good impression.</p>
<p>A friend in a suit, who boarded from Jinan, was sitting across from me. He was an employee of a Jinan automobile company. So, during the chat, Lao Han of Shandong became good material for our temporary conversation. "How is Han X in Shandong?" "He can be considered a good person," he answered like that after contemplating for a long time. "I heard that many cases, he has to intervene himself, almost none of them go through the court." "There is no way, the common people only want to sue him when they file a lawsuit, he set up a room for the common people to sue, and the common people are allowed to sue and he would give an audience immediately, and quickly resolve the matter, so in this way, greedy officials and bullies dare not be rampant, especially for those who smoke white powder and eat opium, he has really shot a lot of them." "He is really a good official who doesn't want money." "But he himself doesn't want money, I'm afraid his subordinates will take advantage of his nodding off to take money privately, but he is too fierce, so this kind of problem is not seen."</p>

<p>Twelve Warships Arriving Continuously</p>
<p>Japanese Concession Checks Chinese Entering and Exiting</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, since the fall of Rehe, the Japanese are trying to disturb our hinterland and disrupt the rear. The Yangtze River area has become their point of attention. It was rumored last month that Japan decided to concentrate its navy in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou to give our side the greatest threat. Judging from the current situation, it is not without reason. It has been found that no more than two Japanese warships were normally stationed in Hankou. After the Mukden Incident occurred, four or five ships were stationed. Recently, only four warships, the Ataka, Futami, Tsushima, and Kotaka, were in Hankou. In terms of protecting Japanese residents, it was more than sufficient. Unexpectedly, on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, three ships, the Sumida, Atami, and Katata, opened to Hankou. At 4:00 PM on the 10th, five more ships arrived, the Uji, Momo, Yanagi, Kashi, and Hinoki, totaling twelve warships. The ships were connected stem to stern, and the situation was gradually becoming serious. The Japanese Naval Commander stationed in Hankou is still Sakano, who is responsible for the highest command. It is said that the Japanese ships were summoned by Sakano. There is also Lieutenant Commander Muto, who is in charge of liaison between Shanghai and Hankou, who went to Shanghai last month and is now in Hankou. The number of troops stationed on each ship varies, and they often land to practice warfare. Our authorities believe that Wuhan is calm, and the arrival of a large number of Japanese warships may cause panic, so they made a special appointment to ask the Japanese consul about the situation. How he replied is not yet known. Recently, a radio station was set up in the Japanese Concession to communicate directly with Tokyo and the three northeastern provinces. They are paying extraordinary attention to Chinese people entering and exiting. Not long ago, they conducted inspections or made illegal arrests. Although the inspection has now stopped, the reconnaissance is even stricter. In addition, they are paying more attention to stockpiling food and selling goods, all of which are bought by Chinese collaborators. However, many Wuhan merchants are quite aware and few are fooled, and the sluggish sales of goods are even more of a major blow to them. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce has held meetings to ask the authorities to find ways to provide relief. Commander Sakano and the Japanese consul have also held secret meetings twice to decide on measures. (April 11)</p>

<h3 id="e98">Ancient Artifacts Continue to Be Discovered in Teng County <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>An Entire Stone Chamber from the Han Dynasty</p>
<p>The Interior Filled with Han Dynasty Images</p>
<p>Jinan Quick Communication: Shandong Province has repeatedly discovered ancient artifacts in recent years, especially Han Dynasty stone carvings. This time, a Zhou Dynasty tripod was discovered in Teng County. Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, was ordered to investigate. While visiting the tomb of Cao Wang, he also discovered an entire stone chamber from the Han Dynasty and thousands of Han Dynasty stone carvings. Not only can the types and uses of Han Dynasty stone carvings be studied, but the architectural style of Han Dynasty palaces can also be referenced and researched. Moreover, the entire stone chamber from the Han Dynasty is unprecedented. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, after investigating the ancient artifacts discovered in Anshang Village, Teng County, heard that there was a tomb of Cao Wang in the east of Anshang Village, which was an ancient site of Tengyi, so he went to investigate and unexpectedly discovered a stone chamber from the Han Dynasty. The interior contains Han Dynasty portraits, which are priceless. According to Wang Xiantang, the tomb of Cao Wang is located ten miles east of Anshang Village and resembles a small mountain. According to the locals, there are ninety-nine tombs on the mountain, but according to his investigation, only eight were found. The shape of the tombs is unspeakable. There is a square opening on the tomb that is level with the ground. Entering through the opening, one sees a stone chamber with walls on all four sides, each with a square door, forming a large room. Its depth may be visible to the edge, or its depth is unknown. All the stone slabs on the roof are supported by stone pillars. All the stone slabs in the tomb are Han Dynasty portraits, totaling more than a thousand pieces of various sizes. The height of the room is seven or eight feet, and the width is about ten feet. The wellhead has a stone cover with troughs and a nose in the middle for lifting. The coffins of the seventy-two martyrs of Luowenyu were transported to the rear for burial. (Photo by Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to local legend, it is the tomb of Cao Cao's father, but according to his investigation, the interior contains Han Dynasty portraits, which proves that it was built by someone in the Han Dynasty to avoid the chaos. The stone chamber has an opening that is not a door, but a skylight of the stone chamber. Although eight have been discovered now, it is believed that there must be dozens, and the stone houses must be interconnected. It is a pity that they are buried by soil. As for the origin of the stone chamber, it is likely that during the late Han Dynasty, the world was in great chaos and wars raged everywhere. People at that time built this stone chamber to avoid the chaos. The reason for using stone is that the area from Anshang Village to the tomb of Cao Wang is all mountainous, making it easy to obtain stone. The poor built houses with stone, while the rich carved stone statues. The stone chamber discovered this time is complete from the Han Dynasty and has not been discovered in previous generations. Its value in cultural history is immeasurable. The value of the Han Dynasty portraits in the interior is even more significant. Although many Han Dynasty portraits have been discovered in the past, they are all fragments. It has not been possible to determine what kind of portraits were used on the walls and what kind were used on the pillars. After the discovery of this stone chamber, the types and uses of portraits can be determined. At the same time, the architectural style of Han Dynasty palaces can also be seen.</p>
<p>There are many portraits in the stone chamber, with varying degrees of carving refinement. The number of Han Dynasty stone carvings abandoned on the ground and on the mountain is countless. It is a pity that the villagers are ignorant and use them to build houses or temples and bridges, which is a great sigh. Seeing this situation, he has decided to collect and preserve them. The first step in preservation is to clear the mountain to investigate the exact number of wellheads (i.e., skylights of the stone chamber) and to open up the underground passages connecting the stone chambers, so that the entire stone chamber can be fully revealed, allowing people to enter and tour. Small pavilions will be built at the wellheads to protect them from wind and rain. The second step is to collect the Han Dynasty stone carvings scattered in various places and build a room to preserve them, so that people from all walks of life can visit and investigate. As for those that have already been used to build temples, bridges, and houses, they will be investigated one by one and ordered to be preserved forever. The above two matters will only cost several thousand yuan, but the ancient heritage can be permanently preserved. He has already drafted a budget and submitted it to the Provincial Government and the Department of Education for review. (April 11th)</p>

<p>Tongsheng Pawnshop in Dongdai, Tongli Town, Wujiang County, suddenly caught fire at 3:00 AM on the 12th. The fire was very fierce.

It burned until about 6:00 AM, completely destroying all the buildings, six进 (sections), more than fifty rooms, and the items in pawn, with a loss of about 110,000 yuan. It is heard that the pawnshop has been open for more than 20 years, managed by Wang Boxuan, and the shareholders are汝孟,戴钱, Chun Sheng, etc. The cause of the fire is said to be that the pawnshop staff went out to watch a night show beforehand and left a cigarette butt in the cargo room when they returned. The local police station has now detained a司務 (clerk) from the pawnshop pending investigation.</p>

The nearby farmers, concerned about their livelihoods, gathered more than a thousand villagers from various villages and townships to petition in the city yesterday (the 10th) morning at 10:00 AM. The county's Public Security Bureau, fearing that the large number of people would cause trouble, prohibited traffic in the north gate. Later, Wang Zuxun, the head of the first district, came out of the city to explain that the petition should not cause disturbance. They then lined up and entered the city to petition the county government, all holding white flags with the words "Petition to Remove the Enclosure of Pangshan Lake" written on them. County Magistrate Wang came out to persuade them to return to their villages first and notified the workers to temporarily stop enclosing the area.

<p>Since the construction of the Wuxi-Cheng Highway, long-distance buses have been running, making transportation convenient.

They are currently actively preparing and plan to contact the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration to sign a contract, which is expected to be implemented next month. However, the section of the road from Jiangyin West Gate to the riverside road is currently being developed by the county's Construction Bureau, but due to financial difficulties, the road surface has not yet been repaired, so it is not possible to run vehicles for the time being. Therefore, even ferry transportation cannot be realized, and the intercity bus between Huangtiangang Port and the southern outskirts is also difficult to become a reality.</p>

<p>The Suisheng Match Factory in Jinshanhe, this port, was originally founded by a Japanese named Ta Keno Takeo. In the spring of last year, the Japanese returned to his country, and the factory was shut down. So far, no one has taken it over. Recently, a wealthy merchant, Mr. Yang, has taken over the factory and renamed it the Neihe Trading Company. It has been greatly arranged in recent days, and the wholesale office has already started working. Men and women workers are signing up at the factory one after another, and the factory is scheduled to start operations on the first day of next month.</p>

<p>The home of Zhu Shourong, a farmer in Zhujiaxia, the tenth district of Xuan County, was suddenly visited by eight bandits at dusk the day before. They entered through the back door and locked the front and back doors, rushing into the bedroom to search. They robbed a long gun and a box cannon, more than a hundred bullets, and silver dollars, clothes, and other items. Before leaving, they kidnapped his younger brother, Shoutang. The home of Guo Yilong in Xiaotanggou in the same district was also looted the same night, and a six-year-old son was kidnapped. The families of the Guo and Zhu have reported to the county government requesting a strict investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Yu Qiaqing's speech stated: "Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives of the municipal government, distinguished representatives, today is the first meeting of this year's congress. It is one day later than last year. When we slightly recall the situation at this time last year, we feel that the tranquility and prosperity of this port were of an unknown degree to which they would be damaged by the Japanese military. No observer could say for sure. However, in hindsight, we can be sure that without the bloody resistance of the Nineteenth Route Army and the Fifth Army, even the mediation of the representatives of the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, would not have been enough to help achieve the May 5th ceasefire and troop withdrawal agreement and stabilize the current situation in Shanghai. However, when will the Japanese military be satisfied? We must not think that the places invaded and bombed by the Japanese military are far away in North China, and we can rest easy. We should know what the situation is north of the Suzhou River. In the year since the last congress, there have been many wars and alarms, and we have spared no effort. However, the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, which were allowed to be used by the Japanese military as bases for aggressive military operations, even after the Municipal Council exempted three months, two months, or one and a half months of property taxes, and the landlords agreed to exempt rents, and the water and electricity companies slightly reduced usage fees, it is unknown when their economic vitality will recover. Even south of the Suzhou River, which was considered a relatively safe area at the time, only with a two-month shutdown, the purchasing power of the citizens of this city was insignificant, and the market gradually declined. Although there was still a lot of coming and going at the market, the sellers were stretched thin. Only shops are closing more and opening less. The closure of downtown areas and the turning over of properties to others are causing uncertainty, and it is unknown what will happen. Looking at the extent of the Japanese military's aggression, otherwise, the business of our Chinese people will not easily improve, and trade with various countries will inevitably decline day by day. This is enough to show that the Japanese military's aggression is enough to destroy world business. In the past year, what has made us concerned and regretful is the increase in telephone charges and the water problem. After the telephone was converted to automatic operation, its service has slightly improved, but the rash increase in prices is in fact incompatible with the post-war economy of society, and in theory, countless users must have suffered from the conversion project for two years, only bearing the cost but not being able to use it. Today, an automatic machine is installed, and tomorrow, there is an obligation to increase fees. Nothing is more unfair than this. Secondly, telephones in the road-building area beyond the boundary must also be converted to automatic machines within two years. This was originally stipulated in the contract, but the reason was that the draft contract was not approved, and the work could not be completed within the stipulated period. The Shanghai Telephone Company was allowed by the Public Concession Bureau to waive its obligation to perform, and the user's financial difficulties and requests not to increase prices immediately were all deemed to be due to the contractual relationship, and it was inevitable. Moreover, the company's miscalculation and excessive expansion, resulting in the inability to distribute dividends, was also considered a reason for the need to increase prices. What is even more painful for the global legal community is the retroactive charging of fees, which destroys the legal principle of 'no retroactivity' by the people of the rule of law. It can be seen that where there is profit, they are unwilling to do anything. Fortunately, telephones are not something that people cannot live without for a day, so even if they are resolutely removed, there is no major harm. However, this is not the case with tap water. According to the tap water in the Public Concession, it has been around for forty or fifty years. Its charging method, like the municipal general donation, is based on rent as the standard, that is, 5% of the rent is collected every month as water charges. In the simple procedures, it contains social policies that alleviate social economy. About six or seven years ago, it was increased to 6%. In March of the 17th year of the Republic of China, when the Chinese directors were about to join the Municipal Council, a new contract was signed, changing the previous method and allowing an interest guarantee of 9%, 8%, and 7%, but still using gold pounds as the capital unit. As a result, the exchange rate fell, resulting in an insufficient amount of silver exchanged for gold to pay the pound interest, and a surcharge of one-quarter was added. For a time, refusal to pay and cutting off water caused a huge storm. The reasons for the dispute have long been reported. Unexpectedly, the Hill report was not fully implemented, and the contract for water meters was not studied in detail for methods of controlling waste. There was no scientific experiment on how much the water fee should be. It was rashly assumed that the original five jiao per thousand gallons of silver dollars plus a surcharge of 0.25 was 0.625 jiao as the basic price of the water fee. As a result, the water fee calculated by the meter was several times higher than before, and some even exceeded the rent. The declaration that 'installing a meter to control waste does not increase the price' has almost become inversely proportional, and fundamentally conflicts with the principle of the Hill report that installing a meter to calculate fees does not increase the burden on the poor and small households. However, the water company does not immediately give discounts to those who fully pay according to the meter, such as the Wing On Textile Factory Company. For a time, the landlords who collected and remitted water fees successively made a fuss and refused to sign the water meter contract, threatening to cut off the water. It goes without saying that those who refuse to pay will naturally be forced to cut off the water. More than 30 users have had their water cut off, and the number of citizens who have been cut off from cooking and drinking is numerous, and their situation is very pitiful. I don’t know how many people were intimidated by the threat of water cutoffs and paid the fees. Seeing that the situation was not being straightened out by the world, the water company asked the Municipal Council to allow a discount of at least one-third of the previous water fee. If so, installing a water meter would require an additional one-third of the water fee. However, the Wing On Company was able to recover some of the fees it had paid according to the meter after questioning, which can be said to be a good thing in misfortune. After this large-scale water cutoff, and fearing that the victims would defend themselves according to the law, the Chinese and Western detectives hired by the taxpayers' donations were specially used to suppress the scene, even though the citizens with a traditional spirit of peace were targeted. In the end, an incident that was bound to happen in a civilized country was not caused. However, under the circumstances that the public's anger was difficult to violate and the desire for exclusivity was difficult to achieve, the original water contract was shelved, and another trial method was set, which has been implemented on April 1. It is said that there is also an advisory committee dedicated to the matter. Although the handling is still considered too late, we are very impressed by the attitude of the parties involved in changing their minds. At the same time, we have to express our gratification in two things, one is education and the other is defense. Regarding the education problem, this association exchanged documents with the Municipal Council on March 26 of the 17th year of the Republic of China, specifically stipulating concrete provisions. Now, all four Chinese children's public schools have Chinese vice-principals, and five primary schools have been established. Although it does not conform to the defense method of adding two schools every year according to the eight-year plan, it is indeed a fact that it is gradually progressing. However, from our point of view, education is a major plan for cultivating talents for a hundred years, and the construction of school buildings must also be consolidated. However, it seems too large to require approximately 700,000 yuan for a small school building. It is better to only seek perfunctoriness in terms of construction, so the cost of two schools can be used to build three schools, which can educate more younger brothers and sisters, and further reduce the number of out-of-school children in the concession to increase the intelligence of citizens. Two girls' middle schools were originally planned, and one has already been opened, with many students. In addition, there was a provision for 150,000 taels of subsidy school fees established by the association the year before, which was proportional to donations. Chinese schools can get 55% of them, but due to various rent obstacles, they were only able to distribute them last year. This year's is also increased compared to the previous year. Although it is far from the provision in the above-mentioned exchange of documents that education expenses should account for 20% of the total expenditure, the Municipal Council has paid attention to citizen education, which should be appreciated. Regarding defense issues, in the past year, the expenses have been 80 times higher than in the first year of the Republic of China, and the strict handling of criminal cases has indeed been more advanced than in the previous year. The detection of kidnapping cases and the rescue of hostages have been rapid and resourceful, which is admirable. The association once sent a letter to the Municipal Council to commend the people who made the effort. However, we believe that the commission of a crime requires many factors, but the initiators must not be very numerous. Among them, those who are unemployed and forced to be cold and forced to join the gang account for the majority. If there is a way to give these coerced people work education, it will be a radical method to reduce crime, and to extract a part of the amount from the defense fee to handle this matter is something that taxpayers and municipal experts believe should be done. The active elimination of crime is no less than the passive suppression, and the great achievement of public security can be achieved. However, representatives, the 950,000 or more citizens we represent, who represent more than 96% of the population in the concession, will have a serious problem to be solved at present or at the latest next year. What is the problem? According to the current financial method and the declining market situation, the income of the Municipal Council will definitely not be enough to meet the expenditure next year. We deeply know that the municipal institution is a permanent organization of citizens. Citizens have new and old representatives, and this institution is actually a potential extension. Individual expenditures must be based on income as the standard, while those who manage municipal affairs often ignore the general economy of society, and always expand the annual budget to show the gradual upward trend of prosperity. Some even regard it as face. In fact, before the World War, politicians and economists generally felt this way, which led to the great reaction of the party and even the implementation. As Mr. MacDonald, the British Prime Minister, said at the closing of the Lausanne Conference on July 9 last year, "The prosperity of the public depends on the prosperity of each individual." He even destroyed the world by saying that the British budget was not enough to meet the needs, and the annual cost was thousands of castings. Many professors and economic experts from the University of Chicago wrote to the US President on January 21 this year, advocating that the US budget does not need to be balanced under the current economic conditions. A fake balanced budget is just a habit. This kind of opinion is very noteworthy and can be an important reference for us. That is, US President Roosevelt issued an executive order on March 28 this year, reducing the salaries of federal government officials by 15%, and the President, Supreme Court judges, and members of Congress are no exception. At the same time, the army, navy, and air force must also reduce their salaries. This kind of action, at least the economic bankruptcy of the city of Chicago, is also one of its lessons. However, has our Municipal Council been affected by the global economic downturn? Has it been affected by the Shanghai War? Has it been affected by the general economic decline of society? All senior officials have not seen a reduction in salaries when the exchange rate is high, but when the exchange rate is low, they are given an exchange loss subsidy of 1.45 million yuan a year, and the increase in salaries and endowments is still the same. The taxpayers who are affected by the economic downturn have to pay everything to meet the needs. Representatives, we must not say that the land donation and the house donation are still 0.7% and 14%, respectively. We must know that the rate has not changed, but the tax has increased. The land donation is increased by estimating high land prices, and the house donation is increased by rising rents. This year's land price has also been overestimated, and the rents are about to be destroyed. It is really a good method to take rent as the standard, but to carry out high estimation calculation. We must pay close attention to and supervise this kind of dark handling method. Our proposition is not that we do not love the Municipal Council, but that we love the Municipal Council very much. It is to maintain the principle that donations and taxes do not hurt the tax source and cultivate the tax source, so that the market, which is on the verge of desperation, will no longer decline and will have the hope of recovery, so that vacant houses will be rented by people, either as shops or as residences, to increase the income of the municipal general donation of the Municipal Council, so that the budget will not become a written expression. As for the continuous increase in land prices, which indirectly leads to further increases in rents, this must be paid special attention to. For example, the editorial of the Shanghai Times on March 29 this year stated that the budget makers should aim at invariance and standardization, and the comment of Mr. Hu Dehai of the Great American Evening News on March 30 stated at the end that Shanghai is still affected by last year's war and must continue to adopt austerity measures before the market shows signs of recovery. The Great American Evening News also published several editorials, hoping that the Municipal Council's annual budget will be announced earlier, which is what we agree with. The addition of Chinese members to the Land Committee, after more than a year of consultation, has been satisfactorily resolved, which further shows the practical cooperation of the taxpayers in this district and is extremely gratifying. We are even more grateful for the efforts of the Chinese directors and committee members to seek benefits for our taxpayers."</p>
<h3 id="e115">Report of the Directors and Committee Members <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The report of Dong and Committee Members Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng who attended the Public Concession Bureau in the fifth session stated: "The hardships experienced by the people of Shanghai in the 21st year of the Republic of China are unprecedented in history. When we were elected by the previous congress as directors and committee members of the Public Concession Bureau, it was just after the end of the war and the devastation had not yet recovered. The Zhabei area was devastated and the casualties were relatively high. Therefore, the initial administration in the bureau was anxious to stabilize the local area and comfort the refugees. The recovery of municipal power in the war zone, the relief of the affected merchants and people, and the prevention of epidemics in the war zone were all carried out in order. After the local security was initially stabilized and order was gradually restored, the various routine construction matters of the municipal administration were discussed, weighed their importance, and distinguished their order. Now that the term of office has expired, we respectfully report to the representatives on the major policies implemented by the Municipal Council in the past year. (1) Distribution of seats on the Administrative Committee. An Administrative Committee is established under the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council. Its number has increased or decreased over the years. This year's committee is not much different from last year. There are more than 40 Chinese members who have the right to participate in various administrative matters in the bureau. The Chinese School Subsidy Committee is purely organized by Chinese people. In addition to the School Affairs Committee, which holds a meeting once every two weeks, the meeting schedule of other committees depends on the simplicity of the affairs. The names and personnel of the main committees are listed below: Finance Committee, 6 members, 2 Chinese members, Director Xu Xinliu and Committee Member Bei Songsun; School Affairs Committee, 7 members, 4 Chinese members, Director Yuan Ludeng, Committee Member Lin Kanghou, and President Liu Zhanen of Shanghai University and Vice President Ou Yuanhuai of Great China University; Police Committee, 7 members, 3 Chinese members, Director Yu Qiaqing, Hu Mengjia, and Committee Member Chen Tingrui; Public Works Committee, 6 members, 2 Chinese members, Director Yuan Ludeng and Committee Member Guo Shun; Public Utilities Committee, 5 members, 2 Chinese members, Director Hu Mengjia and Committee Member Wu Yunzhai; Employees Committee, 6 members, 2 Chinese members, Director Liu Hongsheng and Committee Member Guo Shun; Health Committee, 7 members, 3 Chinese members, Director Liu Hongsheng, Committee Member Long Zhang, and Doctor Kuang Fengtie; Transportation Committee, 6 members, 2 Chinese members, Committee Members Wu Yunzhai and Chen Tingrui; Music Committee, 4 members, 1 Chinese member, Huang Jinwu, Director of Academic Affairs of the National Conservatory of Music; Rent Arbitration Committee, 5 members, 1 Chinese member, Kui Yanfang, Manager of the Real Estate Trust Department of Zhejiang Xingye Bank; Library Committee, 6 members, Chinese members, Director Xu Xinliu and Wang Yunwu, Manager of the Commercial Press. (2) Post-War Reconstruction Facilities in Shanghai. The Shanghai War lasted for a month, and its tragedy should still be in the memory of the citizens. The Public Concession declared martial law on January 28 last year, and local order did not return to its pre-war state until June 13. The Municipal Council specifically adopted donation exemption measures to relieve the affected merchants and people. The northern and eastern districts were the most severely affected, and the amount of exemption ranged from three months, two months, to one and a half months. Other special treatments were handled separately according to their respective circumstances. After the outbreak of the war, the people in the affected areas gathered within the concession. Excluding those who lived in the homes of relatives and friends, public organizations tried to accommodate them. By the end of February, the number reached 70,000, mostly women and children. By the end of March, it had decreased to 53,470, and by the end of April, it was 19,705. By the end of May, only 400 people remained. Those in the Hongkou and North Sichuan Road areas who could not escape were rescued by the committees specially established by the public organizations and the Municipal Council. There were a total of 85 refugee shelters and 26 temporary hospitals, all of which were tax-exempt. With the cooperation of various organizations and shipping companies, most of the refugees were able to leave Shanghai one after another, and the congestion in the concession was cleared before the summer. As for those who lost their jobs due to the war, there were 160,000 in the concession alone by the end of February. If family members are added, the number would reach 500,000. By the end of May, most of the factories had resumed work, and the number had decreased to 45,000. Some Chinese factories also paid living expenses during the shutdown period. The epidemic prevention work began on March 14. The entire war zone was divided into three districts. The average amount of garbage and filth swept by the team every day was 15 tons. More than 100,000 people were vaccinated. The daily cost was 5,000 taels. It was not cleared until mid-June. Therefore, even after the war, the summer epidemic was not worse than in previous years. (3) Progress in Chinese Education. The most notable progress in Chinese education this year was three: (1) Subsidizing private schools. The Municipal Council and the Municipal Education Bureau agreed on cooperation methods for subsidy fees. All Chinese private schools in the concession, whether registered with the Education Bureau or not, but allowed to try out, can be subsidized by the Education Bureau on behalf of the Municipal Council. A total of 57 schools were subsidized throughout the year, with a total subsidy of 80,000 taels of silver. The largest was an annual subsidy of 14,000 taels, paid in four seasons. In addition, the Chinese Education Office and the Health Office sent staff to inspect and determine their use according to their needs. In 1933, the number of schools requesting subsidies increased by 30, so the amount set in the budget also increased to 100,000 taels, which is more than before. (2) Establishment of new schools. The two primary school buildings in the western and eastern districts have been completed and will be moved into one after another. In addition, a primary school was opened at the former China Merchants Public School site leased on Huade Road to meet the needs. The number of students reached more than 600. In addition, there was an original primary school building on Huishan Road. It was originally planned to be used for other purposes when the new school building on Jingzhou Road was completed. Now the original plan has been discarded, and it will still be used for running a primary school. There are now five Chinese primary schools in the concession. Except for one on Huade Road and one on Huishan Road, which are still rented civilian houses, the others have their own school buildings. The foundation is solid, and the development is rapid. As for girls' middle schools, the number of students is developing very well. The purchase of land for building a school building is already in the plan. (3) Improvement of the old system. Senior faculty members of the four Chinese Children's Public Schools are mostly Westerners. This year, each school has added one Chinese vice-principal to be responsible for presiding over the Chinese curriculum and allocating teaching responsibilities. The curriculum has also been improved to suit the current school system. A scholarship has also been established, with 10 places. Students who have passed the entrance examination from the bureau-established primary school and other schools will be rewarded for their outstanding achievements. (4) Return of Road Construction Beyond the Boundary. The negotiations on road construction beyond the boundary have been heard outside. The specific methods have not yet been negotiated. The foreign directors all have a unanimous desire to resolve this issue as soon as possible. It is our duty to expedite its completion. According to the area beyond the boundary, the scope is quite wide. The unfortunate incident last year occurred there. It should be properly planned to return it remotely so that all disputes, such as the construction of roadbeds and the operation of public utilities, can be swept away, which is what local people are happy to hear. It is an act of recovering legal rights, and its significance is even more significant. (5) Negotiations on Water Meter Issues. There is nothing wrong with installing water meters to prevent waste. It has been used in major cities in Europe and the West for a long time. However, due to the habit of the Public Concession over the years, the water fee is paid by the landlord on behalf of the tenant. After trying the water meter, the water fee increased sharply, and some were even nine times higher than the original fee. As a result, the rental income was only enough to pay the water fee, which was still not enough. The Real Estate Association came forward to protest. Some landlords refused to pay the water fee. The Shanghai Water Company threatened to cut off the water. For a time, the two sides were deadlocked, and the situation was very tense. The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council held repeated meetings to properly plan a solution. After several mediations and guarantees, the Municipal Council, the Water Company, and Mr. Feng Bingnan discussed a fair charging method for installing water meters so that after implementation, poor users would not be burdened, and landlords would not have additional expenses. Now, Mr. Feng's suggestion has been adopted. First, a trial period will be set, and the necessary water consumption of each grade of users will be estimated. During the trial period, fees will be charged according to this amount. For those with higher rents, the water fee will be slightly higher than the current water meter system. The rate will gradually decrease according to the amount of rent. For those with very low rents, the rate will be lower than the current price. This method has been implemented on April 1 and published in various newspapers. The trial period is temporarily set for one year, and then the water meter charging system will be formulated according to the experience gained so that it can be adapted to local conditions and implemented without obstruction. (6) Increase of Land Committee Members. The Land Committee established by the Municipal Council in accordance with the Land Regulations to handle disputes over the acquisition of private land intends to add two Chinese members. An agreement was reached last year, and the Chinese and Western Taxpayers' Congress passed a motion authorizing the Municipal Council to contact the relevant authorities and handle the procedures for increasing Chinese directors. The Municipal Council originally requested the right to agree on candidates. After negotiations, it has been abandoned. Now all the procedures have been completed. It is expected that two people will be elected, one by the Chinese Real Estate Association to represent the legal interests of the landlords, and the other by the Taxpayer's Association to represent the legal interests of the taxpayers. It is necessary to ensure that the public interest and private interests are balanced and there is no bias or lightness. In addition to respecting private rights, the intention of preserving the public interest is also preserved. (7) Maintenance of Budget Balance. In recent years, due to the high price of gold and the development of the municipal administration, the expenses of the Municipal Council have increased day by day. There have been proposals to increase donations, but they have been repeatedly delayed because of the consideration of the decline of the market and the depletion of the people's resources. Increasing the burden is contrary to economic principles. The 1933 budget has been compiled, and the shortfall is 1.42 million taels of silver, which is equal to the income of 2.9 months of general donations. According to the budgets of previous years, there were surpluses, but last year there was a deficit, but the amount was very small, only more than 50,000 taels. If the deficit is as large as this year, it is unprecedented. Although various administrative departments have made efforts to tighten their belts, development plans that require too much money have been shelved, and it is still difficult to maintain the balance of income and expenditure. Fortunately, after the sale of the Electricity Department, the bureau has a large amount of money to inject. It has now been decided to allocate 1.5 million taels from the sale account to make up for the budget shortfall. The increase in donations can be delayed. After the war last year, people's lives were difficult, and the local vitality has not yet recovered. Therefore, this move is also required by the environment. The above seven matters may be known to you or not. They are all important policies implemented by the Municipal Council this year and are closely related to the welfare of our Chinese citizens. According to the regulations, each administrative department in the bureau has a monthly report and an annual report to make the administrative situation public to the citizens. The reason is that the citizens are the main body of the local area, and they should be informed of the quality of the municipal facilities and supervise them. The aforementioned monthly reports are published in the Municipal Council's distribution reports and various newspapers every month. The annual report is compiled into a book, both in Chinese and English, and published for circulation. The administrative details of this year have been registered and can be reviewed at any time. We have been entrusted with the responsibility of the Chinese taxpayers, and we have made every effort to fulfill all the local welfare-related and legal rights. We are still ashamed that we have not been able to live up to the expectations of the society and the encouragement of you. I hope you can understand this.

<p>The various important proposals were discussed and resolved by the general assembly as follows: (1) The proposal regarding the Municipal Council managing factories. Explanation: The Shanghai Municipal Council will hold a special meeting of taxpayers at 5 PM on April 19th, during which the fourth proposal will be presented: "Please amend clause 34 of the Land Regulations appendix, that is,"</p>
<p>"In the first line of the clause, after the words 'within this boundary,' add the words 'owning or occupying, opening a factory or workshop, or engaging in industry.'" Resolution: According to the opinion of this general assembly, most of the factories in the International Settlement employ Chinese workers. If factory management laws are established separately from the Chinese government and Chinese factory laws, it would be detrimental to China's sovereignty. Therefore, it is specifically resolved that any proposal or amendment to the Land Regulations and attached laws that would grant the Municipal Council the power to manage, inspect, or supervise all factories within the settlement should not be agreed to. Proposal to add a Chinese auditor to the Municipal Council. Explanation: Article 12 of the Shanghai Foreign Settlement Regulations stipulates that all income and expenditure accounts managed by the directors should be audited, and the audit situation should be publicly announced after being approved by the taxpayers' meeting. This meeting should be held when consuls of various countries convene an annual meeting. Resolution: According to the opinion of this general assembly, in order to satisfy the wishes of our Chinese citizens and adapt to the needs of the environment, it is necessary for the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council to hire qualified Chinese individuals to audit the accounts. The Municipal Council is hereby authorized to proceed with all necessary procedures in order to realize the hiring of one Chinese auditor as soon as possible. Also, a temporary proposal: (1) Jin Runxiang proposed that all taxpayers within the settlement, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, should hold a joint taxpayers' meeting. Resolution: To be studied in detail by the executive committee. (2) Hu Fengxiang proposed that senior Chinese staff should be rapidly increased in important departments of the Municipal Council, such as the police department, fire department, and health department, in order to eliminate barriers. Resolution: Approved in principle and handed over to the executive committee for handling. (3) Liu Zhongying proposed that the Municipal Council should pay attention to relieving unemployment. Resolution: Handed over to the executive committee for research and implementation of specific plans.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Shanghai Commemorates the Purge Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Held a Commemorative Meeting in the Morning</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Authorities Strengthened Defenses</p>
<p>Yesterday was the sixth anniversary of the Chinese Nationalist Party's purge. The local Municipal Party Headquarters convened representatives from various agencies and organizations at 10:00 AM in the party headquarters to hold a commemorative ceremony, which adjourned at 11:00 AM. At the same time, it was also a commemoration of the "April 12th" communists, so the defenses in the local area were also strengthened compared to usual. The following is a record of the events:</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Municipal Party Headquarters Holds a Commemorative Meeting <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the Municipal Party Headquarters held a commemorative meeting in the auditorium on the third floor of the headquarters on Linyin Road. More than a hundred representatives from the municipal government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Municipal Farmers' Association, and various district party headquarters, labor unions, and schools attended the meeting. After the meeting began, Tong Xingbai, Chairman of the Party Headquarters Executive Committee, and Tong Muge, Master of Ceremonies, performed the ceremonies as required. First, Chairman Tong gave a speech, stating that today is the first day of the party's purge movement that began six years ago. Regarding the significance of this purge movement, I believe everyone understands it. When the purge was implemented in the sixteenth year of the Republic, it caused doubt among many people, because there was first tolerance of the communists, and then a purge occurred. The policy of the Nationalist Party seems to have contradictions. However, it is actually quite easy to understand this. At that time, the tolerance of the communists was in the hope that the Communist Party could truly engage in revolution. However, since the tolerance of the communists in the thirteenth year of the Republic until the sixteenth year, it was not only discovered that the Communist Party could not engage in revolution, but the Communist Party also provoked discord and always harbored the intention of disrupting and subverting the party. The Nationalist Party had to take purge actions because of this. Therefore, it is not that the Communist Party cannot be tolerated, but that after tolerance, the Communist Party did not strive for revolution, but instead had a conspiracy to rebel. This is a contradiction of the Communist Party, not a contradiction of the Nationalist Party. As for the Communist Party's political struggles in various countries, they exist in various European countries, which is well known to anyone. However, looking back at the communist parties in various countries, none of them are like the ones in China, who specialize in murder and arson. Take the past in this city as an example. Whenever there is a communist memorial day, the communists secretly distribute meaningless leaflets and slightly damage a few tram windows, which can be their direct action, returning reports to their superiors to claim credit. Consider whether this policy can succeed. Recently, many people in China have surrendered. We only need to ask them how the internal work of the Communist Party is, and we will know that what I said is not false. Also, at this time of national crisis and deepening foreign troubles, the Communist Party is still jumping around in the rear. Therefore, the Nationalist Party's purge in the past was first of all to unite and unify the party's forces. But from another perspective, it is to eliminate the Communist disaster so that we can eliminate foreign troubles and achieve true success. Therefore, the significance of the Nationalist Party's purge is to hope that comrades within the party will jointly bear this responsibility, work together, and achieve the goal of clearing the communists before we can save the country. Then, slogans were shouted and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Chinese and Foreign Authorities Strengthen Defenses <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Nationalist Party's purge movement, and at the same time, it was the Communist Party's "April 12th" anniversary. In order to prevent the Communist Party from causing trouble, the military and police authorities in this city strengthened precautions. Starting at 7:00 AM, the entire Public Security Bureau was dispatched, and double sentries were added at major intersections and important passes. The old Ximen Li Bin Bridge, the north and south train station direction offices, and the special arrest teams were stationed to check suspicious pedestrians. The public and French concession authorities also took extremely strict precautions. Police cars patrolled the remote sections of the Western Shanghai area bordering the Chinese-controlled areas from time to time. Because the precautions were extremely tight, there were no disturbances throughout the day.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The National Lawyers Association Sends a Telegram to the U.S. President to Pay Attention to the Sino-Japanese Issue <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The National Lawyers Association yesterday sent a telegram to the U.S. President and also sent telegrams to legal groups nationwide, stating, "For reference by newspaper offices and legal groups: Recently, it was read in the newspapers that U.S. President Roosevelt invited representatives from various countries to go to Washington to exchange opinions on the revitalization of the world economy. It is the opinion of this association that the revitalization of the world economy is closely and inseparably related to world peace and order. A telegram is specifically sent to President Roosevelt, with the text: Washington, Chinese Minister Shi Zhaoji, please forward to His Excellency President Roosevelt: The prosperity of the world economy must be built on the foundation of world peace and order. Now, when the violent Japan is destroying peace in the Far East, we are delighted to meet His Excellency the President's grand event of inviting representatives from various countries to exchange opinions on the revitalization of the world economy. This association expresses its deep sympathy and hopes to promote the spirit of the Non-Aggression Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty to eliminate the factors that disrupt world peace, so that economic revitalization can be as easy as turning one's hand. Otherwise, the world's largest market will be trampled on, gradually occupied exclusively by the strong, and further increase the flames of its threat to the world. In this way, not only will there be no hope for the world economy to recover, but we worry about the future and dare to ask the world. We hope for a bright future. The matter concerns the happiness of all mankind and not only the interests of the Far East. We hope for unanimous support and are extremely eager. Liu Liumin, Jiang Yong, Yan Yinwu, Dai Tianqiu, Liu Zhe, Standing Committee Members of the All-China Lawyers Association, respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Zhang Zhiben Sends Telegram to Nanjing to Resign Due to Illness <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhiben, Vice Chairman of the Constitutional Drafting Committee, has recently been suffering from headaches and has been hospitalized for treatment. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to Mr. Sun Zhesheng, President of the Legislative Yuan, requesting his resignation. The original telegram roughly stated, "I have been suffering from brain disease, which has recently worsened. At this critical moment of drafting the constitution, I am afraid that my sick body will delay the great cause. I dare to request my resignation. I hope for approval, etc."</p>
<h3 id="e129">New Director of the Mint, Lu Xuepu, Assumed Office Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Entire Factory Remained as Before, with No Personnel Changes</p>
<p>Increase the Number of Coins Minted to Meet Needs</p>
<p>The resignation of Guo Chengen, Director of the Central Mint, was approved. The Executive Yuan's meeting the day before resolved to appoint Lu Xuepu as his successor. Mr. Lu arrived at the factory at 9:00 AM yesterday to take over. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Assumed Office Yesterday Morning <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lu arrived at the factory at 9:00 AM. The former director, Mr. Guo Chengen, was waiting at the factory to hand over the office. Because there were no changes in the staff of each department, the procedures were very simple. Former Director Guo gathered all the factory staff in the auditorium, introduced the new director, and urged all the staff to do their best to help the new director complete the factory's mission in sorting out the currency system. Then Director Lu gave a speech and the meeting dispersed. The ceremony was very simple.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Director Lu's Instructions <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Lu Xuepu gave instructions to all the factory staff, saying, "This factory began to be established in the ninth year of the Republic. At that time, I was serving in the Ministry of Finance in Beiping, preparing everything, and I also participated in it. It has been operating for more than ten years and has a rough scale. The times have changed, and I have not been able to see it completed. Since Director Guo took office, he has actively engaged in minting work. After the news of the opening on March 1st spread, all sectors admired his extraordinary perseverance. This is the only commemoration of this factory, which is admired by us. Director Guo has formulated a number of preferential regulations for all employees, such as savings, insurance, and pensions, etc., on the one hand, to stabilize the lives of all employees, and on the other hand, to stimulate the sense of responsibility of all employees."</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Jiangnan Railway Company is Scheduled to Hold an Inaugural Meeting in Shanghai <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Acceptance of the Ningxiang Property Approved by the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Laying the Wuhu-Zhapu Railway Will Commence Shortly</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway Company has been preparing for more than six months. The fixed capital of one million yuan has now been fully raised and has been largely paid. Surveying plans, land acquisition, and material procurement have also been completed. It is now learned that the company is scheduled to convene shareholders on the 19th of this month to hold an inaugural meeting to formally establish the company, and it plans to start construction at the end of this month, in order to complete the project and open it to traffic as soon as possible. The following is an exploration of the progress of the preparations:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Surveying Work <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway Industrial Division operates the railway transportation business, selecting the Wuhu to Zhapu route, laying railways in stages. The first phase will first build from Wuhu to Sunjiabu. The surveying work began on August 21 of this year. By October 6, the Wuhu to Xuancheng section was surveyed and completed. This section uses a portion of the old Ningxiang Railway line, measuring 67.7 kilometers. After the completion of the Su-Xuancheng section, various materials and standard charts were actively prepared, and the surveying work from Xuancheng to Sunjiabu was completed. As for the Taozhi to Xuancheng section, the acquisition of the roadbed has now been submitted to the provincial government for requisition in accordance with the Land Acquisition Law, and roadbed earthwork is currently under construction.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Extending the Route <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The company's plan originally scheduled the first phase of construction to be from Wuhu to Xuancheng, totaling 67.7 kilometers, with a budget of 1.69 million yuan (excluding the Ningxiang line property of the Ministry of Railways). Now, after detailed estimation by Engineer Hong, if the most economical construction method is used, the route extended to Sunjiabu Town in the southeast of Xuancheng may not exceed the original budget. It is found that Sunjiabu is an important grain-producing town in southern Anhui, and the population and commerce are more prosperous than Wanzhi. It is also the place through which the coal mine railway of Shuidong passes. In the future, it will be a fixed transport route for rice, grain, coal and wood, so extending the route is a very good idea.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Filing for Registration <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The surveying charts of the Wuhu-Xuancheng section were sent to Nanjing at the end of last October, and a document was immediately prepared and sent to the Ministry of Railways requesting registration. Zhang Renjie, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, personally contacted Minister Gu several times to achieve a satisfactory solution. At that time, the Ministry of Railways proposed joint operations with the company and the use of heavy rails, but the difficulties were explained in detail and could not be followed. Provisional registration was approved, and the approval was not received until December 5th. The license was not issued until January of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Transfer of Property <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Since the company has selected a portion of the old Ningxiang Railway line, it has negotiated with the Ministry of Railways on the transfer of the old Ningxiang base, Wuhu-Wanzhi section, property of the Ministry for a permanent solution. This section of the base was built early and has three railway bridges, but it was stopped due to some reason and the rails were not laid. According to the estimate of Mr. Gruf, the chief engineer sent by the Ministry of Communications in the fifth year of the Republic, the value of this property is 720,000 yuan. However, seventeen years have passed, and the railway bridge earthwork must have been damaged, so Zhang Renjie and Minister Gu agreed that the company and the Ministry of Railways would sign a contract to transfer the property, valued at 360,000 yuan. Repayments will begin on December 1, 1929, with an annual interest rate of 6%. Except for the last half year, each half year will repay 28,000 yuan in principal and interest, and the full amount will be repaid in seven and a half years. After thirty years, the Ministry of Railways will continue to buy it back at a price. The contract has been signed by the company and sent to the ministry. However, in order to protect the future construction of the Ningxiang Railway, the Ministry of Railways has exchanged documents with the company, stating that the Ministry of Railways has the right to build a parallel railway from Wuhu to Wanzhi. The company has already agreed to this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Date of Commencement <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The company's preparations are all in order, and it has purchased many cars and freight cars from the Beining Railway Bureau. Other materials have also been processed, so it is urgent to start construction in order to open to traffic as soon as possible. It is now learned that the company is scheduled to hold a foundation laying ceremony in Wuhu before the end of this month to start construction.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Inaugural Meeting <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The company's shareholders are scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting in Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 19th of this month to formally establish the company in accordance with the organization of a limited liability company. Invitation cards have now been sent, inviting all shareholders to attend at that time.</p>
<p>Strive to increase business, with benevolent intentions, which has a great impact on the future of the factory. This kind of far-sightedness is even more admirable. As for Xuepu, he has been in the financial world for eleven years and has served in the northern and southern financial sectors for fifteen years. He has some experience. At the beginning of this assignment, because he was not a minting expert and had no research on minting work, and at the time of the change of the currency system, the minting of currency was not only related to the national finance, but also to the attention of the international community. The duties were heavy, and I did not dare to take on the task, so I asked to resign but was not allowed to. Now I have to work hard to do it. Xuepu's consistent principle in handling affairs is to only discuss right and wrong, regardless of gains and losses, and the principle of using people is to only ask about merits and demerits, without any love or hate. Open-mindedness and fairness should be understood by all colleagues. Fortunately, all the factory's industrial affairs have been perfected and carefully planned by Director Guo, and the rules are in place. I hope to abide by them together with all my colleagues. The results have been demonstrated during Director Guo's tenure, and I hope that we will continue to work hard in the future to make this factory famous, which will not only be the good fortune of Xuepu and all colleagues, but also can not fail to live up to the guidance of Minister Song, and can barely live up to the expectations of society. I believe that Director Guo will also regard this as a common goal."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Congratulations from All Walks of Life <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>In the morning, those who came to the factory to offer congratulations included former Deputy Minister of Finance Zhang Shouzhu, Qian Xinzhi of the Four Banks Reserve, Hu Mengjia of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, Xu Xinliu of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Li Yunliang of the China Merchants Bureau Audit, among others. Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, and Qian Xinzhi, Hu Mengjia, Tang Shoumin, and Hu Bijiang, among others, also sent a large silver cup. All the colleagues of the Bank of Communications sent a large silver cup as a congratulatory gift. Mr. Lu is scheduled to go out in the afternoon to return the courtesy calls to important figures in the financial and monetary circles.</p>
<h3 id="e140">No Personnel Changes <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lu did not bring anyone with him when he took office, and he did not change any of the existing staff. However, Wang Xuan, Director of the Audit Department, Tang Shuchi, Chief of the Mechanical Engineering Section of the Engineering Department, and Zhu Tian, Chief of the Security Section of the General Affairs Department, had already submitted their resignations, and Mr. Lu retained them all in order to get started quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e141">President of the Central Bank Will Take Office Soon <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi is Scheduled to Take Office on the 15th</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, the newly appointed President of the Central Bank, has been persuaded by Chairman Lin and Director Wang in many ways and is scheduled to take office at 9:00 AM on the 15th of this month and hold an inauguration ceremony.

<h3 id="e143">Cheng Qilu's Report <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Experience of the Fierce Battle at Lengkou</p>
<p>Shang Zhen's representative, Cheng Qilu, reported to the Shanghai Public Associations on the process of annihilating the enemy at Lengkou, saying, "Qilu was ordered by General Commander Shang Qizi to come to Shanghai. His mission is twofold: first, to convey the deep gratitude of the Commander and all officers and soldiers of the Corps to the various Shanghai groups for the supplies received through General Zhu Ziqiao. Second, concerning the Battle of Lengkou, gentlemen in Shanghai concerned about national affairs have sent letters and telegrams inquiring about the battle situation. At that time, the replies were brief and not exhaustive. Now that the enemy's offensive has been defeated and the defenses have become more consolidated, I have been instructed to make a more detailed report to you. Qilu is not eloquent, so I will present a brief outline: (1) Recapturing Lengkou: Our Corps' defense was originally focused on the Luan River area. The Lengkou area was originally under the defense of another army. However, since the loss of Rehe, Lengkou was also occupied by the enemy on the evening of the 4th of last month. Upon receiving the report, our army, recognizing the importance of the pass, which not only affected our flank but also the safety of Pingjin, immediately dispatched the Huang Guanghua Division to block the enemy. The division set out that night, advancing at full speed, and arrived at Huan'an on the evening of the 5th. Initially, the enemy only had over two hundred Japanese soldiers and over ten armored vehicles. On the 4th and 5th, the enemy gradually increased to over a thousand soldiers, with sixty or seventy armored vehicles and tanks, mixed with puppet troops, infantry, and artillery, and constructed fortifications to try to hold the pass. On the evening of the 6th, Huang Division's Jiang Regiment advanced towards Jianchangying and launched a night attack on Lengkou. Before dawn on the 7th, they began attacking the enemy's position. The enemy stubbornly resisted, relying on the terrain. Our infantry and artillery fired together, destroying dozens of enemy vehicles. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Until 5 p.m. that afternoon, the enemy could not withstand the assault and retreated north in disarray. We used a main force to hold Lengkou and sent another force to pursue the enemy. Corpses littered the road, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. We captured many enemy artillery shells, rifles, orders, maps, and other items. (2) Lengkou's Defense and Equipment: After recovering Lengkou, we anticipated that the enemy would value the pass and launch a counterattack. We had to urgently devise defensive measures. However, the area is mountainous, and materials were scarce, making construction difficult. Therefore, we decided to deploy troops outside the pass to annihilate the enemy by opportunity, preventing them from approaching the Great Wall. (3) The Enemy's Second Counterattack: On the 17th and 18th of last month, a large number of enemies were discovered in the Dushan area, and a fierce battle was anticipated. On the 19th, dozens of enemy cavalry engaged with the plainclothes team led by platoon leader Zhenying of the Cai Lin Regiment at Jianshimen, forty or fifty miles north of Lengkou, and were repelled. This plainclothes team was originally composed of five elite soldiers selected from each company, who were determined to die if necessary, and were led by company and platoon leaders, distributed in key locations such as Huangtupo and Dashimenz, to maintain strict vigilance. On the 20th, the enemy used over a hundred cavalry to reconnoiter the front of our position. At 2 p.m. on the 21st, a combined force of over twenty armored vehicles, six or seven hundred infantry, and over a hundred cavalry launched a fierce attack on our plainclothes team. Platoon leader Ma fought bravely, hiding behind stone piles and earthen embankments, waiting for the enemy to approach before throwing grenades and shooting with pistols at distant targets, killing many enemies. In the end, due to the enemy's numerical superiority, the obstacles were destroyed by enemy tanks, and he was killed in action, with a dozen or so soldiers wounded and killed. The enemy then advanced to the vicinity of Huangtupo. (4) The Fierce Battle of Lengkou for Three Days and Nights: On March 22, after the enemy advanced to the vicinity of Yuanjia Yingzi, they began to attack our position fiercely. Our Division Commander Huang Guanghua personally led the Lin Regiment at the forefront, engaging in a fierce battle. From morning to night, the enemy gradually increased their infantry to about three thousand, with over ten artillery pieces, several tanks, and over a hundred armored vehicles. After a day of fierce fighting, they were repelled by our army. The enemy then increased their forces again and launched a large-scale attack, making the battle even fiercer. Our positions at Xiaojia Ying and Madaogou were repeatedly lost and regained, over a dozen times. Around 6 p.m., our army charged out of the position, destroying three enemy tanks and seven armored vehicles, and killing four or five hundred enemies. Division Commander Huang, with a righteous formation, fought the stubborn enemy for two days and nights. Despite the enemy's superior equipment, they were still fighting like trapped beasts. He then used unconventional tactics. That night, he added Jiang Regiment's Li Battalion, who, via Sidaogou, outflanked the enemy's right flank. At 4 a.m., they reached the front of the high ground southeast of Jiaolipu and launched a fierce attack on the enemy, driving them back around 10 a.m. and occupying the highlands around Gaolipu. At the same time, Guo Regiment's Dai Battalion was also dispatched (at the same time as Jiang Regiment's Li Battalion, they departed on separate routes) to outflank the enemy's left flank from Longwangmiao. However, due to the winding roads and enemy aircraft interference the next morning, the battalion advanced bravely and drove out the enemy from Yingtaoyuan at 4 p.m., occupying the area. These were all events of the 23rd. Our army's flanking attack on the enemy's rear had succeeded, and we immediately launched a frontal attack, engaging in fierce battles throughout the day. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. The battle on that day was as fierce as the battles of Gubei and Xifeng, and the enemy's aircraft were particularly active, forming teams of three or four aircraft and taking turns bombing our positions and the Lengkou and Jianchang areas. (6) The Enemy's Retreat: Previously, our General Commander, seeing that our army's continuous resistance had become increasingly fierce, went to the front line to supervise the battle on the 23rd. At that time, the Li and Dai Battalions were each bravely attacking the enemy. Li Battalion had occupied the northern highlands of Gaolipu, and Dai Battalion had also occupied the area around Shanshenmiao. As the fighting continued into the evening of the 24th, the enemy's momentum waned. Our army also suffered casualties, including five company commanders, over ten platoon leaders, and over three hundred soldiers. On the 25th, Zhang Kexun, the battalion commander of the Lin Regiment, personally led a courageous team of over two hundred men, launching a fierce night attack on the rear of the enemy's Jianjiayingzi, using grenades and broadswords to kill many enemies. The enemy wavered, and Battalion Commander Zhang died in action, deep in enemy territory. The enemy was therefore unable to expand their gains greatly. However, after this battle, the enemy suffered significant losses, and most of them withdrew to the rear of Xiaojiaying. The fighting also became more subdued. On that day, there was a strong wind and rain, and both sides reorganized. (6) Overview of Lengkou from the 26th of last month to the 4th of this month: After the 25th, our army continued to launch night attacks, as did the enemy. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. At 2 a.m. on the 29th, over a hundred enemies advanced to the vicinity of our Shanshenmiao, and were almost completely annihilated in our counterattack. After dawn, many weapons were collected, and many important documents were recovered from the enemy corpses. After this, the enemy infantry hid and did not come out, but over ten aircraft bombed our position every day. The bombing is still ongoing daily. Recently, it seems that they are concentrating their forces to attack our left flank. Our army is extremely vigilant and determined that there will be no other dangers. (7) General Commander Shang's Determination to Resist Japan: Our General Commander has been ordered to resist Japan and has a long-standing heart for serving the country, which you gentlemen know well. There is no need to say more about saving the country. Qilu also need not elaborate further. However, when we recovered Lengkou, I sent a telegram to Mr. Kong Yongzhi, in which I said, "If the enemy comes, I swear to die with them." Also, in the instructions to all officers and soldiers of our Corps, there are the words, "We will never allow anyone to take one inch or one foot of the land left by our ancestors." When he wrote these words, his tears fell with the writing, and his expression was passionate, moving all officers and soldiers. These two examples alone can show his determination to resist Japan. And the two phrases "With the enemy, there is no me; with me, there is no enemy" are the only creed in our Corps. (8) Hope for Spiritual Victory over Material: Our country's resistance to Japan this time is far inferior to the enemy in terms of material, which need not be explained in detail. Not only are our artillery and aircraft far behind, but even in terms of transportation, our army lacks heavy trucks. In terms of communication, our army lacks communication equipment. And even in terms of self-defense steel helmets, enemy-killing broadswords, and all the ordinary and necessary supplies for combat, almost none are available. In short, in terms of material, the enemy is superior everywhere, and we are inferior. However, the enemy has fast guns, but we have flesh and blood. The enemy has giant cannons, but we have courage. The enemy has aircraft circling in the air, but we have popular support filling the universe. In other words, the enemy has material, and we have spirit. The enemy can be defeated with a stick, and the will of the people is stronger than metal and stone. At this critical moment of life and death, if the soldiers do not risk their lives, it will not be enough to survive. If the masses are not of one mind, they cannot save the country. Therefore, we must hope for the unanimous assistance of the people of the country, so as to shield our rear."</p>

<p>Arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and will travel to various important places in the country</p>
<p>Report on the latest international situation and inspect the current situation of the motherland</p>
<p>Zheng Yanfen, Secretary of the League of Nations, has returned to China on leave. After passing through Hong Kong, he was invited by various groups and schools to give lectures in Hong Kong and Guangdong. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago on the Russian Empress. Mr. Zheng has been abroad for many years, and the situation in his motherland is very unfamiliar to him. He previously returned to China to attend the Third National Congress, but the time was short and he had no time to stay in the motherland for a longer period to make more observations. This time he returns to China and plans to travel to various parts of the country to inspect the current situation in the country and report on the latest international situation to all sectors. Mr. Zheng is scheduled to go to Beijing within a few days, transfer to the Pingpu Line to Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping, and then go to Taiyuan and Dingxian, before going to Hankou, Fuzhou, and Xiamen, and then return to Geneva via Hong Kong on a ship to resume work.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Sock Factory Runs Night Shifts, Disturbing People's Dreams, Lawsuit <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Find ways to improve and reduce noise</p>
<p>Judge ordered exemption from punishment</p>
<p>There are many factories in the Public Concession, and residents are close together. However, the authorities have not yet divided the factory area or the residential area, so there are often factories adjacent to residents. If the factory has to do night work, the sound of the machines and the workers' shouts will inevitably be deafening all night long. Those who live nearby are disturbed by the noise and cannot sleep all night long, which has a great impact on the residents' peace. Recently, the Hua'an Sock Factory at No. 1027 Dexinli, Binlang Road, West Shanghai, has been running night shifts since last month, and the sound of the machines has been incessant all night long after 12 o'clock every night. The neighbors of the factory are all residents who deeply hate the noise of the factory, which makes them unable to sleep all night long. So their neighbors Li Yongde, Li Wenlou, Yan Xinpei, Xiao Zhang, and others went to the Gordon Road Police Station to report the situation of not being able to sleep and requested assistance. After the head of the police station went to the factory to investigate and found that it was true, Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the Legal Group of the Public Works Department represented the Bureau and filed a complaint with the First Special District Court against Cui Zhenghua, the owner of the Hua'an Factory, and Yu Dabao, the manager. However, China's Factory Law has not yet been promulgated, and there are no suitable clauses in the current law, so it is based on Article 36 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Yangjingbang Regulations, which states that the defendant released loud noises for no reason, disturbing the peace. The First Special Court has held a hearing once, and Shen Shanzeng, the magistrate, continued to summon the defendant yesterday morning. According to lawyer Ru, if the defendant's work does not harm others, the Public Works Department will not interfere. Now, the residents around the factory must serve for their occupations during the day, and they cannot rest at night. It is important to know that sleep is a right given to people by God and cannot be deprived by anyone. Although the defendant's noise was caused by work and not for no reason, the right of people to sleep has been infringed upon for no reason. In order to protect the peace of the residents, the Public Works Department filed a complaint and should be given relief. Li Yongde and others testified in court that they were disturbed by the loud noise of the factory at night, which made them unable to sleep. The defendant hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend, saying that the defendant was willing to improve the equipment in the factory, hoping to reduce the noise. Magistrate Shen then ordered the defendant to be exempted from punishment, ordering them to find ways to improve their equipment as soon as possible so that the noise would not disturb the peace of the neighbors, and to stop using the motor after 12 o'clock every night until dawn as much as possible. This unprecedented sleep case was concluded.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Troublemaking Vietnamese Police Officer Punished <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to three months in prison</p>
<p>Fined two hundred francs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the case of a Vietnamese police officer shooting and injuring a Chinese in West Xinqiao Street was tried in the French Concession Court yesterday (the 11th) and a verdict was reached. The police officer was found guilty of carrying a gun with live ammunition in violation of the regulations and was sentenced to three months in prison and fined two hundred francs. The police officer confessed that he did not fire his gun at the crowd at the time, but he injured someone. It was unexpected. The questioner also found that the police officer's shooting was provoked by the actions of the Chinese. However, the police officer's carrying a gun with live ammunition was indeed in violation of the regulations, so he should be punished according to the law.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is Easter, commonly known as Foreign Qingming. All foreign merchants, banks, and foreign firms in Shanghai will be closed for a holiday, from the 14th to the 17th, for a total of four days. Because the 16th is a Sunday, the 17th is a makeup day. As for Chinese banks, except for the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China Merchants Bank, the rest of the banks below the Central Bank will be open as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Further News on Dai Chengzhi Impersonating a Military Instructor <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Dai Chengzhi from Wuxi, who impersonated a military instructor appointed by the Training Supervision Department and taught at Daxia University and Datong University, has been reported in this newspaper. It has now been found that the two schools each received an order from the Training Supervision Department through the post office one day before Dai Chengzhi came to the school, which roughly stated: "It has been found that high schools and above schools have implemented military training in accordance with the Ministry of Education's circular. Dai Chengzhi, a military instructor at the Wuxi Middle School, has been promoted to instructor at the university, etc." The two schools believed that the order from the Training Supervision Department was indeed sent from Nanjing, and the seals on the envelopes were authentic, so there was no doubt. The next day, Dai Chengzhi brought another letter of appointment from the Training Supervision Department to the school, met with the authorities, and discussed teaching hours and salary. A few days later, he started teaching on time. However, Daxia University believed that the school was not directly affiliated with the Training Supervision Department, and all official documents related to military training had always been forwarded by the Ministry of Education. It was doubtful why the department directly sent instructors to the school this time, so it reported the situation of the instructor coming to the school to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education immediately consulted the Training Supervision Department and asked why the procedure for sending instructors to the school this time was wrong and requested a reply. Later, the Training Supervision Department replied that there was no promotion of Dai Chengzhi to instructor at the school and requested that the original order be returned to the school for investigation. At the same time, the Training Supervision Department telegraphed the local garrison headquarters to secretly arrest Dai. He was arrested at Daxia at 4 p.m. on the 10th of this month. It was found that Dai had received a total of 80 yuan in salary from Daxia in two installments. The report that he had borrowed 600 yuan from the school for marriage expenses was not true.</p>
<p>Superior and orderly, which is highly commendable. In particular, the exquisite engraving of the printing department and the novel and durable printed fabrics are regarded as rare in the past and present. He also said that the most lacking thing in our image industry is products with artistic qualities. Now that the factory's goods pay great attention to the ethnic preferences of various ports, the creation of patterns and the novelty of colors can be said to be of the highest quality. He lingered for a long time. When Yu Zhendong asked him to give frank guidance, Mr. Chen replied that such achievements show the hard work of the organizers. He eagerly hopes that they will continue their efforts and not slack off. If they can continue to make progress, can there be no great hope for the future of national goods? I will do my best to protect them within my responsibility in order to jointly seek expansion. After the visit, a photo was taken to commemorate the occasion.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Li Chunshan's Family Appeals to the Municipal Government for Negotiations with Japan After His Abduction <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that Li Chunshan has been sent back to Korea</p>
<p>Diao Degao is a henchman who deserves to be killed</p>
<p>It has been more than a month since Li Chunshan, the Korean revolutionary leader of Chinese nationality, was arrested on Luban Road. A few days ago, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested a Chinese traitor named Diao Degao, and it was learned that the case was indeed done by the Japanese. Recently, there has been a saying that Li Chunshan has been sent back to Korea by the Japanese police. Li's family yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting it to negotiate with Japan according to law as soon as possible, and requesting that the traitor be executed. The original petition is as follows:</p>
<p>Petitioner Li Jinjingji, 45 years old, originally from Korea, registered in the Republic of China, currently residing at No. 54 Baokangli, Xiahfei Road, Shanghai, is appealing for a cross-border kidnapping and private repatriation, requesting a reasonable negotiation and strict punishment of the traitor in order to uphold the law and protect sovereignty. My husband, Li Chunshan, fled to Shanghai with his family in anger at the violent Japanese annexation of Korea. The Three Han patriots agreed to transport independence, and my husband also participated in it. Therefore, the Japanese hated my husband, no less than a thorn in their side, and often thought of getting him and being happy. Last year, after the Shanghai war ended, the bomb case in Hongkou Park arose. The chief culprit was greatly clumsy, and several people were killed and injured. The Japanese Consulate in Shanghai suspected that my husband was one of the masterminds and secretly ordered the Japanese police to search his residence in the French Concession. At that time, my husband happened to be out, so he was not caught, but the revolutionary comrade Mr. An Changhao was arrested. Because my husband could not live in peace in the Concession, he moved to the Chinese territory in Nanshi, relying on the protection of the local military police to ensure his safety. Unexpectedly, the Japanese police still sent plainclothes police to bribe traitors to investigate everywhere. On the evening of the ninth of last month, when my husband went to visit a friend on Luban Road, he was suddenly kidnapped by several Japanese police officers and put in a car and sped away. At that time, those who saw it on the road thought it was a bandit kidnapping and were afraid that there would be weapons and injuries, so they did not dare to stop him. Afterwards, the Second District Public Security Bureau sent detectives to investigate, but there was no news. Only that a traitor named Diao Degao had been arrested and was being interrogated. I could have quietly waited for the authorities to deal with it according to law, but suddenly saw in Chinese and foreign newspapers that my husband, Li Chunshan, had been sent back to Korea by the Japanese police and would be punished with severe penalties for subverting the government of the Japanese Empire. Upon hearing the news, I could not help but feel extremely sad. It was found that my family had already joined the Republic of China since the fall of the motherland and had a naturalization license No. 11 issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the central government as proof. When my husband was kidnapped that day, it was on Luban Road in the Chinese territory. How could the Japanese ignore Chinese sovereignty and arrest him privately? Therefore, I am filing a detailed statement and asking you to negotiate reasonably as soon as possible to save my husband. At the same time, I earnestly request that the traitor Diao Degao, who colluded with the enemy to be a henchman, be executed to satisfy the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people, and my family will be grateful. Respectfully presented to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Two Daytime Robberies in the City Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>(Dingda Zhuang) At about 12 o'clock yesterday morning, three robbers suddenly came to Dingda Shenzhuang, No. 6 Fuchangli, Xiaodongmen. One of the robbers had a pockmarked face, wearing a black gown and a brown felt hat. One robber was wearing a blue cloth gown and a melon-skin hat, and one robber was wearing a gray gown. They all spoke with local accents. After entering the door, they each pulled out a gun and told them not to make a sound. At that time, the employees in the village knew that they were robbers and were trying to sneak out the back door to report to the police for arrest. Unexpectedly, another robber, wearing a blue-gray gabardine jacket and a black eye mask, seemed to be afraid of being recognized, strode in through the back door, pulled out a gun and drove all the people in the village into the wing room and held them at gunpoint. The remaining robbers then went to each toppled boxes and cabinets, taking away 200 yuan in cash and foreign money, a small diamond ring, and a gold pocket watch, worth more than 90 yuan in total. They carried the stolen goods and sneaked out the back door, fleeing in the direction of Dasheng Lane.</p>
<p>(Passed on to Mrs. Wang) A Ningbo woman, Fu Wang, 31 years old, lives at No. 16 Jinjiafang in the city. Her husband, Fu Kunbao, used to be a coppersmith, but has now returned to his hometown for business. At about 9 o'clock yesterday morning, the woman went to the Hongqiaotou vegetable market to buy vegetables when she was suddenly robbed by two robbers who forcibly took away a gold bracelet and a gold ring from her wrist. The woman shouted loudly, but she was shot in the right leg by a robber who pulled out a gun. After the woman was injured, blood flowed like a column and she fell to the ground in pain. At that time, the vegetable market was at its peak, and suddenly hearing the shouts of thieves and gunshots, buyers and pedestrians fled in panic, and the order was in chaos. Li Keqin, the guard police officer of the nearby 32nd post, heard the news and rushed over. The robbers, seeing that they had caused a major disaster, had fled into the crowd without a trace, so they were not able to catch them. They sent the injured Fu Wang to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is said that the bullet that hit her leg has not yet come out and needs to be surgically removed and then recuperated, but her life is not in danger.</p>

<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo feels deeply that the national situation is deteriorating and that only by vigorously advocating production and saving the country can we seek survival. Therefore, this time when he came to Shanghai, in addition to contacting important officials, he paid great attention to the domestic industry. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, he went to visit the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Factory in a light car and reduced company. He was received by Yu Zhendong, Chairman of the company, and others. He first entered the guest room to rest. Mr. Chen then inquired in detail about the history of the factory. Afterwards, he began to visit, from the newly built weaving factory to the printing and dyeing departments, carefully examining everything. He praised the organizational situation of the weaving factory, the large number of daily products, the density of the cloth, and the excellent living conditions of the workers in Xuzhou. He was very pleased with Mr. Renhang, who is well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning and has always taken it as his duty to promote Eastern culture. He founded the Kunhua Doctrine and went to Nanyang and India to publicize it, and to investigate the social conditions, customs, and culture of various places, which has been praised by famous people in those places. Recently, he planned to organize a health and longevity association to solve the standards of life. The other day, he invited his comrades to hold a preparatory meeting at Sun Hongyi's residence, No. 15 Chukhangli, Pushi Road, at 4 pm. Dozens of celebrities from all walks of life attended. The preparatory charter was passed (charter attached) and the correspondence address was determined to be No. 68 Pushi Road, French Concession. The first step is to start publishing the Health and Longevity Pictorial for publicity. Liu also intends to have a Health and Longevity Association to solicit comrades, collecting historical materials from ancient and modern times in the East and West, which is quite rich, with thousands of words, which is truly an important plan in the high praise of world peace.</p>

<p>Body Found in a Small Creek</p>
<p>Three Small Holes Found in the Top of Her Head</p>
<p>On the morning of the day before yesterday, at around 4 AM, a vegetable vendor passing by a small creek near the Bu Family Residence in the southern part of Yangjing Town, Pudong, discovered the body of a young woman floating on the surface. Nearby residents later identified her as the wife of Jiang A'gen, who lived in Jiang Family Lane to the west. The deceased's maternal family, upon learning of the incident, repeatedly gathered crowds to vandalize Jiang's house and belongings, causing a great disturbance. The detailed findings of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e159">Discord Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Si'hai, a local resident of No. 15 Jiang Family Lane in the southern part of Yangjing Town, is 43 years old. He has been working as a cook at the Huang family in Xiaonanmen, Shanghai. His wife, Gu, is 40 years old and has a son named A'gen, who is 23 years old and works in the cold work section of a steel factory. A'gen married a woman named Zhu in October of the year before last, but they have not had any children. The relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law may have been strained. Zhu moved to an old house at No. 21 to the west last summer. Because A'gen works away from home, he rarely returns. Zhu relied on selling vegetables to support herself, and the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was quite distant.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, Zhu suddenly went missing a few days ago. On the morning of the day before yesterday, at around 4 AM, her body was discovered floating in a small creek behind the residence of Tu Dong Bu Hezhou in the 25th Tu of Bu Family Residence. The nearby villagers were greatly shocked and came to watch. The body was then recovered, and it was observed that there were three small holes, about the size of mung beans, on the hairline of her head. The sight was very tragic. The Tu Dong reported the matter to the Third District Second Branch, requesting the local police to ask the local court to send personnel to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Only an Empty Shell Remains <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>After the case occurred, it caused a sensation in the surrounding area. After someone reported to the deceased's maternal family, believing that the mother-in-law, Gu, had always treated her daughter-in-law cruelly and suspected that she and her son had plotted to kill her, they immediately gathered dozens of strong men and rushed to the new house where Gu lived. First, they smashed all the dowry and clothing from the deceased's marriage, and then set them on fire. Then, they destroyed all the stoves, pots, tables, benches, and chopsticks in the three rooms of the eastern half of the new house, including the living room. Not satisfied, they gathered more people a second time to dismantle the doors, windows, and wall panels, leaving nothing intact. Yesterday morning, they gathered people for a third time to smash all the large and small utensils in the house, leaving nothing behind. Looking from the outside, only an empty shell of a house remained. Gu and her son had fled far away and dared not resist.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Results of the Investigation <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the report, the local court immediately dispatched a prosecutor and his staff to the countryside to investigate. The investigation revealed that the small holes on the top of the deceased's head appeared to have been caused by iron nails. There were also several abrasions on her fingernails. Her body was bruised all over. However, it was difficult to determine whether these injuries were fatal wounds inflicted before her death or caused by someone after her death. It was also impossible to believe that she had committed suicide by drowning. After completing the investigation, the judge ordered that the mother-in-law, Gu, and the deceased's husband, A'gen, be arrested and brought to court for questioning. The body will be taken to the court for further examination.</p>

<p>To Promote Japanese Silk Sales in the United States</p>
<p>The United States is the largest silk consuming country in the world, requiring 600,000 dan of raw silk annually. Although affected by the recession last year, it still consumed 553,888 dan of raw silk. Japan supplied 518,794 dan, accounting for 90% of the US sales. However, the Japanese government still believes it is insufficient. According to Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Raw Silk Inspection Department of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, he received a letter from Tao Di, director of the New York Raw Silk Inspection Institute, reporting that the Japanese government recently sent Yoshida, former director of the Yokohama Raw Silk Inspection Institute, and Shiga, former representative of the Japan Silk Industry Association in the United States, to the United States to organize the Japanese Raw Silk Visiting Bureau in the United States to promote Japanese silk sales in the United States. It also prepared one million Japanese yen to conduct propaganda work for Japanese silk in order to enhance Japanese-American silk trade relations. The American silk industry believes that this move is very important. Tao Di sent a letter asking China to catch up quickly and not fall behind. According to Mr. Miao, regarding China's liaison with the American silk industry, he plans to discuss concrete measures with He Bingxian, director of the International Trade Bureau, in the near future and proceed with them effectively.</p>

<p>Reader's Advice</p>
<h3 id="e181">A Collection of Letters Discussing the Question "Can We Return to the Countryside?" (5): Mr. Zhu Tianqing from Benhang Writes: Sympathizing with Mr. You Huaigao's Method <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>After reading Mr. Liu Simin's "Discussion on 'Can We Return to the Countryside?'" today, I feel that Mr. Liu has some misunderstandings about Mr. You's views, so I am not afraid to show my ignorance and write this article specifically to point out Mr. Liu's misunderstandings. (1) Mr. You said: "People who have lived in the city for a long time may feel the boredom of loneliness, but I feel that in this time of national crisis, seeing the decadent life in the city, it is better to find a quiet and lovely village to seek another way out, and use ten years of my ability to build a 'new type of Peach Blossom Spring' that I have imagined." These words are truly insightful and have a very profound vision. Of course, people who have lived in the city for a long time often feel the troubles of life. If they have the opportunity to go to the countryside, they can not only get a kind of adjustment in their lives, but also benefit their body and mind. As for Xiongshengjun, instead of feeling the difficulties of a stagnant life in the city, it is easier to solve life in the countryside. In this way, naturally, Xiongshengjun needs to return to the countryside. Furthermore, everyone knows that rural education in our country is underdeveloped. Because of the underdevelopment of rural education, the average farmer does not know how to improve cultivation, and is extremely negligent when it comes to national affairs. To be honest, if rural education in China were developed, then China's agriculture would have flourished long ago, and would not be as sluggish as it is now. Although the bankruptcy of agriculture is due to internal strife, if one wants to do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools. The increase in production volume still depends on the improvement of utensils. The improvement of utensils, of course, depends on the farmers who are on the scene. However, farmers who are ignorant and unknowing, farmers who have not received education, only know how to stick to the old ways. How can they know how to improve utensils, seeds, etc.? Why do farmers in Europe and the United States know how to improve utensils and seeds, while farmers in our country do not? This is of course due to lack of knowledge, so lack of knowledge is obviously due to the underdevelopment of rural education. Here, we can see the importance of rural education. Therefore, Mr. You teaching Xiongshengjun to return to the countryside not only allows Xiongshengjun to adjust his body and mind, but also makes life easier to solve. At the same time, he can devote Xiongshengjun's strength to the development of rural education, which is not without benefit to the country. Why not do it with one stroke and three gains? If Siminjun does not teach Xiongshengjun to go back, may I ask, is there another way out? Otherwise, call Xiongshengjun to wander in a foreign land and starve to death? As for finding another profession, to be honest, in Shanghai, where supply exceeds demand, Xiongshengjun may not be able to find a foothold for a while! (2) The "new type of Peach Blossom Spring" is a kind of imagined construction. The Japanese invasion and the communist disturbance are a kind of destruction. Each tends to extremes. If you are afraid of destruction, then don't build. However, destruction is destruction, and construction is still necessary. People in the world know that war is destructive, and they predict that war is inevitable. In order to avoid war and destruction of construction, they should not engage in construction, but the opposite is true. Looking around the world, which country does not strive to engage in construction? If Siminjun looked at it, they must be crazy, but they are not crazy! 丨丨 Then why is this? Hey! Hey! This means that construction is construction, and destruction is destruction. If you build a "new type of Peach Blossom Spring" and are afraid of the destruction of Japan and communism, it is like a person who is afraid of death after being born. If people are afraid of death, it is better not to be born. I said, Siminjun, if you are afraid of death, it is better not to be born. Furthermore, Mr. You's so-called construction of a "new type of imagined Peach Blossom Spring" does not mean that after building the "new type of Peach Blossom Spring," he can ignore national affairs, "regardless of the Zhou and Qin dynasties, let alone the Republic of China." It is well known that the main point of building a "new type of Peach Blossom Spring" is to make people aware of national affairs, because the starting point of building a "new type of Peach Blossom Spring" is to develop rural education, so the highest purpose of developing rural education is to make people understand national affairs. In short, this "new type of Peach Blossom Spring" is not the "Peach Blossom Spring" in Tao Qian's imagined world that does not ask about worldly affairs. Siminjun has not yet seen through this point and added criticism, which can be said to be extremely ridiculous. (3) The bankruptcy of the countryside is not only because the countryside is dominated by the city. It is well known that the bankruptcy of the countryside is complex, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, the bankruptcy of the Chinese countryside is due to internal strife and the constant disturbances of the communists. However, if rural education in China were developed, then the bankruptcy of the countryside would not be a complete failure. Indeed, rural education in the United States and Japan is ten or a hundred times better than ours. However, Siminjun, may I ask, is the extent of the bankruptcy of rural areas in the United States and Japan more severe than in our country? If my observation is correct, then I think it may not be! (4) Furthermore, generally speaking, people in the city are indeed much more cunning than people in the countryside. If you don't believe me, just look at the darkness in Shanghai. May I ask, is there any in the countryside? Siminjun, you said, "Most of the 3.2 million people in Shanghai (shop assistants, workers, and some young students) are still honest and not deceitful." This may not be entirely true. You must know that nothing in the world is absolute. You say that iron is cold, but it can also be hot when exposed to the sun or in the fire. You say that shop assistants, workers, and some young students are still honest and not deceitful is unreliable, because shop assistants, workers, and students also have good and bad differences!</p>

<h3 id="e185">Fujian Education Department Issues Scholarships to Poor Students <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Nine Students Including Zheng Chunting Were Selected and Admitted</p>
<p>To Be Issued After Enrollment in the Summer</p>
<p>In order to subsidize poor high school students in the province to enter higher education and university students to continue their studies, the Fujian Rescue Education Department held a scholarship for poor students. After examination and review, more than 80 students were approved to participate in the examination, which was held in Fuzhou, Shanghai, Beiping, and Wuchang. Except for the Fuzhou District, which was directly handled by the Education Department, the other districts were entrusted to local education institutions to conduct the examination. However, the test questions for each subject were all formulated separately by the examination committee hired by the department, sealed and sent to the examination institutions in each district. All test papers were sealed, and the test papers of students in districts outside the province were sent back to the Education Department, where the original question setters were invited to review them in the department to show prudence. It was found that 37 students who did not go to higher education and 27 students who went to higher education participated in the examination. The "Scholarship Committee for Poor Students and University Scholarships" carefully calculated and decided the number of places to be admitted for each subject. It was found that the original examination was scheduled to select two students each in liberal arts, engineering, science, medicine, and agriculture. However, the results of the examination showed that the performance in agriculture was poor, so it was finally decided to select one more student each in liberal arts and science to make up for the shortage in agriculture. As for the students who applied for engineering and passed, there was only one. In order to cultivate specialized engineering talents, the Education Department specially set up two backup places to show encouragement. A total of nine students were selected for the liberal arts, science, engineering, and medical fields, and two backup students, Ji Zuxuan and Liu Yongmao, were selected for engineering. The committee decided that Li Zuxuan should apply for the engineering department of the university within this summer vacation. If he can be admitted, he will be given a scholarship. If he is not admitted, Liu Yongmao will be used to fill the vacancy. The list of students who have been officially admitted is as follows: Liberal Arts: Zheng Tingchun, from Yongtai, graduated from Gezhi; Gao Mingkai, from Pingtan, graduated from Yinghua; Lin Enqing, from Minhou, graduated from Yinghua; Science: Lin Renmu, from Minhou, graduated from the science department; Lin Kongxiang, from Minhou, graduated from Jimei; Guo Dongbing, from Nan'an, graduated from the Xiamen University Affiliated High School; Engineering: You Dezi, from Minhou, graduated from Fuzhou High School; Medical: Lu Songci, from Gutian, graduated from Yinghua; Ye Xingjie, from Minhou, graduated from Yinghua.</p>

<p>(I) Normal schools should be established independently. The normal school departments originally established within provincial and municipal middle schools should be separated and changed into normal schools starting from the next academic year. Each province should also, in accordance with Article 10 of the Normal School Regulations, divide the entire province into several normal school districts and establish normal schools and women's normal schools separately. If, due to financial constraints, the original normal school departments within middle schools cannot be fully separated and established immediately, special normal departments and simplified normal departments may be established separately within public senior or junior middle schools in accordance with Articles 3 and 6 of the Normal School Regulations.

<p>(III) Provincial and municipal departments should, within possible limits, and considering local conditions,</p>
<p>move most normal schools to rural areas.</p>
<p>(IV) The naming of normal schools established in various provinces and cities is inconsistent and should be corrected separately in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Normal School Regulations. A list of all normal schools under their jurisdiction and the corrected names must be reported before the summer vacation of this year, and the changes should be uniformly implemented starting from the next academic year.</p>
<p>(V) The reporting of matters by normal schools in various provinces and cities is inconsistent, and many omissions are not reported. Hereafter, the provisions of Articles 12, 13, and 15 of the Normal School Regulations should be strictly followed, and reports should be filled out accurately and on time.</p>
<p>(VI) The expenditure of funds for normal schools in various provinces and cities has consistently lacked reasonable allocation, which greatly affects educational efficiency. Starting from the next academic year, the allocation of recurring expenses for each normal school should strictly follow the percentage specified in Article 20 of the Normal School Regulations. Furthermore, the respective departments and bureaus should, in accordance with Article 21 of the Regulations, formulate methods for auditing the income and expenditure of normal school funds and submit them to the Ministry for record.</p>
<p>(VII) The standards for provincial subsidies to county-run normal schools should be stipulated by the respective departments and submitted to the Ministry for record.</p>

Rural normal schools should add courses related to rural areas and agriculture.

<h3 id="e204">Bernal's Performance Was Excellent at the Start of the Second Week Yesterday <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Defeating Maxwell Was as Easy as Turning His Hand</p>
<p>The Result: 1,000 Points to 548</p>
<p>—Schedule Changes, No Competition Today—</p>
<p>British master Bernal performed exceptionally well in the second week of Shanghai's amateur Grade A billiards competition yesterday. All the spectators in the audience were amazed. Bernal has a long-standing relationship with Shanghai's billiards community, at least for more than ten years. He also once ascended the league and held the reins. In recent years, Shanghai-Portuguese experts Li Gongying and Medina have appeared one after another, and the old general had to retire from the road of talent. Until recently, the edge has gradually emerged. Judging from yesterday's results, he has a tendency to restore his dominance. In the future, there will be a shocking competition with Medina. Maxwell's performance yesterday was almost surrendered to the old general's gun style, and there was no way to develop. In the first half, the difference was still close, with Bernal scoring 500 points and Maxwell scoring 340 points. In the second half, Bernal's bullets were all hits, and the gun was fired with a path. Whether it was self-falling, sending red, or opening a , everything was done as desired. At one point, there were three shots of 72, 54, 54, and other huge numbers. Far from this big difference, the final result was that Bernal won with 1,000 points against 548 points. Also, the order of the second week has been slightly changed. Parker vs. Medina in the first half has been changed to the 18th, Li Gongying vs. Xu Shizhang in the second half on the 19th, and Zhang Yingda vs. Shen Lince on the 20th.</p>
<p>Two People's Highest Scores</p>
<p>Bernal 27, 23, 30, 24, 33, 28, 41, 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 20, 22, 25, 72, 54, 54, 62, 36, 38.</p>

In the second half, Xinwen exerted their remaining strength, turned defense into offense, and approached step by step, regaining two points with a score of 9 to 7, resulting in a total score of 20 to 19.

<p>Flitting about like blooming branches, eyebrows dancing with delight;</p>
<p>Suddenly, she encounters a plain and simple country woman,</p>
<p>Whose needlework from head to toe is all self-made.</p>
<p>She spins her own yarn, weaves her own cloth,</p>
<p>And everything used in her home for food, clothing, shelter, and daily life is domestic.</p>
<p>Simple and rustic, yet she can represent Chinese housewives.</p>
<p>Modern girl, please stop laughing at her, stop disliking her,</p>
<p>Promoting foreign goods like you do, you truly don't understand the pain of national demise.</p>
<p>We have already changed our perspective, looking at these simple and honest women,</p>
<p>With much admiration and celebration.</p>
<p>Seeing you, so strangely adorned from head to toe in foreign goods,</p>
<p>We must consider you a complete "businesswoman," deserving of utmost disgust.</p>
<p>This is a humble little poem that I often unconsciously recite to many women, and they not only don't take offense but say it makes a lot of sense. Why not publish it in the National Products Weekly to contribute to the general public of housewives.</p>
<p>Young lady, when you get older and want to choose a suitable husband,</p>
<p>The first condition should be that he uses national products.</p>
<p>A talented man and beautiful woman, of course, are desirable,</p>
<p>But a complete playboy who only consumes foreign goods,</p>
<p>No matter how much your matchmaker tries, running east and west,</p>
<p>Because I love national products, I absolutely will not marry you, you conscienceless fool.</p>
<p>This is my second humble little poem, which I often unconsciously recite to many young girls, and they all nod and smile, urging me to publish it. Just as this journal is publishing a "Special Issue on Women and National Products," and needs an opening statement, since I don't have time to write an article, I'll just use this to fill the space.</p>
<h3 id="e211">A New Condition <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yu</p>
<p>丨Please Pay Attention, Ladies Who are About to Get Engaged丨</p>
<p>The evolution of the marriage system from "parents' orders and matchmaker's words" to the current system where the parties involved must agree can't be said as anything but a blessing for modern youth. One distinctive feature of the modern marriage system is that before engagement, whether a man or a woman, they all have several conditions for choosing a spouse in mind. There are many such conditions, such as personality, knowledge, ability, health, interests, appearance, economics, etc. Many experts spare no effort to conduct surveys and research. From what I have seen and heard in the conditions for choosing a spouse among modern youth, there is one point that has not been noticed. Readers, try to guess what condition it is. Since this article is published in the National Products Weekly, smart readers will naturally know it all: "The condition for choosing a spouse should include the condition of loving national products." That's right, my opinion is indeed so, that "loving national products" is a condition for choosing a spouse, and an important condition at that. Why? Let me explain.</p>
<p>The national crisis is so severe, and the people's livelihood is so impoverished. While promoting national products is not a miraculous cure for bringing the dead back to life, it can at least plug some leaks, cultivate some national wealth, and inflict some slight blows on our strong neighbors, seeking a glimmer of hope for the people's livelihood. To deny the value and necessity of promoting national products today is to be without blood and without conscience. However, there are many who say that national products should be promoted, but in reality, desperately act as voluntary promoters of foreign goods. Especially unmarried men, who consider using foreign goods to be fashionable, extravagant, and a display of their abundant economic capacity. But when you ask them whether national products should be promoted, they again wholeheartedly agree with promotion. People who contradict themselves in this way, their words are all false, all deceitful. If someone is like that regarding promoting national products, they are likely to be like that in all other matters. You see, they are full of professions of love for you, full of promises to be your slave, but all of it is false, all of it is deceitful. If someone had the courage to argue that national products should not be promoted, and then used foreign goods and consumed foreign goods, that kind of person would be a man who takes responsibility. But someone who admits that national products should be promoted, yet only seeks foreign goods, this is enough to prove their hypocrisy, prove their deceit. How dangerous it is to offer your virgin, pure heart to a hypocritical, deceitful man! A man who worships foreign goods, whether he buys foreign goods to show off, to follow fashion, or to flaunt them to you, his behavior is hateful, his heart is detestable. You must not be seduced by him, deceived by his dishonesty. Therefore, even when everything else about him meets your standards for choosing a spouse, you must also pay attention to whether he is a man who loves his country in word and deed, before deciding whether to follow him or not.</p>
<p>Truly loving and using national products can certainly prove that he is a genuine, patriotic man, and also that when forming a family in the future, many unnecessary wastes in the family's finances will be avoided. Your family will never experience economic hardship due to extravagance, nor will the family go bankrupt due to extravagance. At the same time, the national economy will not suffer losses because of your marriage. Ladies, this condition for choosing a spouse, its importance really doesn't fall behind conditions like personality, knowledge, ability, health, interests, appearance, economics, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Small Suggestions Regarding National Products <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ai Cheng</p>
<p>I am a housewife from a middle-class family. My husband works in education, supporting the whole family with his salary. Our family of seven, I manage all the clothing for all four seasons. Whenever we buy new clothes, I spend quite a bit of effort on the fabrics. Children of course use national products, and even my husband and I like to use national products. But what are national products? What are foreign goods? It's not easy to tell. Sometimes I think it's a national product, and the store clerk also says it's a national product, but when I take it home and ask someone, they say it's a foreign product. All my happiness is doused with cold water, and there's no greater disappointment. Therefore, my first suggestion is that I hope the National Products Guidance Bureau or the China National Products Promotion Association can compile a national products guide to be my guide for buying national products in the future. National product colors are often not very fashionable, and the prices are more expensive than comparable foreign goods. For economic reasons, many women reluctantly buy foreign goods. Therefore, my second suggestion is that I hope national product manufacturers will research dyeing and manufacturing, and lower prices, adopting a policy of small profits and quick turnover. National product education should be deeply imprinted in children's minds; this is a responsibility that all housewives should bear. Not only should children be taught to use national products, but they should also be made to understand what national products are and why they should be used, cultivating good habits of using national products. This is the basic work of promoting national products. Therefore, my third suggestion is that I hope the national product industry will compile more pictures and stories about national products and give them away whenever women come to buy national products; this is the most effective advertising. The three suggestions above, although not very profound, are indeed easy to implement. People who are enthusiastic about promoting national products, it seems, should pay attention and study them.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Three Agreements <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Wanxia</p>
<p>Since men are so apathetic, I especially want to encourage our courage. If we are not yet married, we should propose an extremely important condition when engaged, three agreements, namely, neither of us will use foreign goods. If one party violates this, the other may propose divorce or punishment, all of which should be written clearly in the agreement.</p>
<p>If already married, then use stern admonition and close supervision.</p>
<p>As for everything used at home, it should be entirely up to us to purchase, without going through them. However, we must also carefully examine when purchasing, brands, factory names, raw materials, sources, and even inspect the manufacturing site when in doubt, so as not to be fooled, because there are many unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>If they accidentally buy a non-national product back, we will ruthlessly destroy this non-national product into pieces, or even cut off relations for two or three hours. This way, they will never do it again next time. However, you must be full of spirit, with the idea of ​​punishing one as a warning to a hundred, so that it is a permanent solution, otherwise, even if you quarrel every day, they will still violate the agreement every day. This kind of psychology must be understood.</p>
<p>A man will eventually be matched with a woman. A family cannot be formed without a woman. Isn't the heavy responsibility of promoting national products all on our shoulders? Conversely, destroying national products and promoting foreign goods is also our major sin.</p>
<p>Sisters, starting from today, quickly rise up to take on this extremely important responsibility of promoting national products, and never be criminals of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Relationship Between Women and National Products <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>

<p>In the past, I ran the "Little Swordsman" three-day publication and asked my old friend Mr. Zhao Jinqing to write an inscription. At that time, Mr. Zhao was the director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Shanghai Office. He said that newspapers represent public opinion and have the responsibility to guide society. They must have the true spirit of being incorruptible in wealth and status, unyielding in poverty and humbleness, and unbowed by force, as described by Mencius, so that they can write truthfully and be worthy of their heavenly duty. Shuowen (說文) explains that the word "xia (俠)" (swordsman) means using power to help people fairly, justly, selflessly. Therefore, the actions of swordsmen often involve helping the weak and suppressing the strong to redress grievances. Your publication is named "Little Swordsman," indicating that it is a voice for the people, unafraid of the powerful and tyrannical, which is the so-called fearless spirit of the late Premier. In addition to writing the ten characters "Have a fearless spirit to speak out against injustice," he also said that recently,</p>
<h3 id="e215">Women's Only Responsibility in the National Crisis <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Wang Huanqing</p>
<p>"The merchant girl does not know the sorrow of a conquered nation, still singing 'Backyard Flowers' across the river." In the wine-green, lantern-red, gold-obsessed, and paper-drunk Shanghai, it seems like a time of singing and dancing, and although there are many patriots, what use are a few ordinary people with no money and no iron? However, the Republic of China ultimately belongs to the people, not to bureaucrats, politicians, local tyrants, and unscrupulous merchants, so we must not just watch and sigh, but each individual must earnestly start from themselves. Save on clothing and food, be diligent and hardworking, to be the backing of the Northeastern soldiers. Although it is said to be saving the country, it is actually saving ourselves. It is also to leave some room for future generations. As the saying goes, "If the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?" May I ask, have the compatriots under the iron hooves felt the pain of national subjugation? We cannot hold steel knives and carry bombs to kill the Japanese invaders and recover the lost territories, but why are we not doing the easiest things, and instead learning to sing and dance in a leaky boat? How lamentable and pitiful! I believe that the only fundamental goal of saving the country is to improve families, educate children, and guide them onto the right path. If a housewife can manage her family well, in an orderly manner, educate her children to become sound citizens, and have no selfish or deceptive behavior, she can rectify any corrupt phenomena and influence her own children, relatives, friends, neighbors, servants, and maids to not buy foreign goods, let alone buy enemy goods. If a family still sees enemy goods being used there, we will despise their character and not associate with them. Because such people are fundamentally servile and can be said to be non-human. Let us women rise up quickly, improve families and educate children internally, and resist enemy goods and promote national products externally. This is our only fundamental responsibility for saving the country. Finally, let us shout a slogan:</p>
<p>"Women's only responsibility is to use national products."</p>
<p>Foreign goods are flooding the market, and women buy more of them than men. Among women, prostitutes who like to show off are especially prevalent. If we do not try to remedy this situation, profits will flow out, and the country and people will be impoverished as a result. Small newspapers cover news about women in brothels in more detail than larger newspapers. Your newspaper's second issue included an article titled "Swordsmen in Brothels," which shows that the Little Swordsman does not forget the brothels either. I hope that in the future, you will pay more attention to those in brothels who like to use national products and exclude foreign goods and publicize their actions. This will let decent women know that there are still patriotic compatriots in brothels who are enthusiastically using national products and rejecting foreign goods, and they may have a change of heart and switch to using national products. This may not be a bad way to promote national products. Your intentions are profound and admirable. Frankly speaking, out of the 400 million compatriots, half are men and half are women. Although both should work together to promote national products, the enthusiasm of women will certainly outweigh that of men. In recent years, foreign goods have increased daily, encompassing almost all four elements of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. They are cleverly designed, inexpensive, come in many categories, and offer a wide variety of styles, dazzling the eyes. The clothing that women themselves wear, as well as the clothing and food bought for their children, and the cosmetics used daily, make up a large portion of these goods. Moreover, the clothing worn by men and all the miscellaneous items in the home are mostly purchased by women. If all the women in the country can recognize that a strong neighbor is pressing in and that the country is facing a crisis, and from this year's National Products Year onward, make a major decision to avoid being seduced by the word "fashionable," regardless of the type of clothing, food, housing, and transportation items,</p>
<h3 id="e216">Promoting National Products Must Start with Women <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Baixue</p>
<p>"Women are the mothers of mankind, so promoting national products must start with women."</p>
<p>This is what my father said to me when I was reading the newspaper just now.</p>
<p>That's right, women are always the mothers of mankind, responsible for educating children, or, in a broader sense, responsible for educating mankind. Moreover, women are in charge of all household affairs, such as buying new clothes and miscellaneous items for the home. It is the women who propose what to buy and then hand it over to the men (or the women themselves or both men and women) to take care of it. Because men are almost always working outside, they don't pay much attention to household matters. Therefore, women are the most important people in the family.</p>
<p>Especially children, mothers must teach them to cultivate the habit of loving and using national products. To cultivate the habit of loving and using national products, first of all, there must be a good national product environment; to build this national product environment, all clothing, utensils, and equipment in the family must be completely national products.</p>
<p>If men want to buy foreign goods, women should dissuade them, and men will invariably listen. But if women want to buy foreign goods, men mostly go along with it; even if they try to dissuade them, it has very little effect. This is a shortcoming that women should eliminate.</p>
<p>Women, remember: Women are the mothers of mankind, promoting national products must start with women!</p>
<p>If we discard foreign goods and buy national products, then even if unscrupulous merchants seek huge profits and secretly sell inferior goods, because no one patronizes them, they will eventually switch to selling national products. Then, because national product factories have a wide sales market, they will inevitably strive for excellence, increase output, and lower prices. The commercial and socioeconomic situation of the country will inevitably develop gradually. Among the women in our country, those in Shanghai are the most fond of using imported goods, followed by those in cities, and then those in rural areas. The reason for this is indeed the harm caused by the word "fashionable." Shanghai is a diverse place with people from all over and a large number of foreign goods. The number of prostitutes is the highest in the country. Because of their business relationships, prostitutes compete to be the most unique and choose imported goods to decorate themselves, only seeking to be bright and eye-catching and to attract the attention of admirers, regardless of the outflow of profits and economic aggression. General mistresses and modern women admire their beauty and do not care about the source of money, and they follow suit, dressing flamboyantly and developing habits. Even young ladies from good families try their best to imitate them, and it is almost as if it is unfashionable not to use imported goods. In cities where this trend started early, it has become a common practice. Money flows out, day by day, and the sales of national products plummet. If the female compatriots in the intellectual class can lead by example, resist foreign goods, and switch to using national products, and everyone considers it shameful to use foreign goods and fashionable to use national products, it may not be impossible to change customs. I hope that Shanghai women will take advantage of this national crisis, actively proceed, and work together to be an example for the women of the country.</p>

<p>— Pu Manbin</p>
<p>Checking things over. When my husband and I have free time, we often carefully check the clothing, food, housing, and personal belongings in our home and on our bodies to see if there are any non-national products. We often find that the thumbtacks and bookbinding staples used by the children do not have domestic products. One day, I accidentally saw this product at the Jiaotong University Exhibition and was very happy.</p>
<p>Parents set an example. Young children in the family are very imitative. They do as they see their parents do. Over the past few years, our family has gotten used to national products, and all the children like national products. Once, I gave Ah Wei a foreign cloth shirt that Ah Quan wore ten years ago. Ah Wei cried and said, "Father, mother, and brother all wear national clothes. Don't I love the country?" She finally took it off and was happy. One day, she was the vice mayor of the children's market at the China National Products Company. I put a new dress on her, and she secretly went to ask Mrs. Xu next door, "Is this a pure national product?" She was relieved when she got the answer.</p>
<p>Exchange conditions. Once, Mr. Xu Yangnan married off his daughter and invited Mr. Ren Zhi to be the wedding officiant. Mr. Ren Zhi said that if the new couple used national products, he would be happy to do so. This is also a good story in the Year of National Products. I advised my husband that he could use the same as an exchange condition in the future. Even entrusting someone to introduce a job, we must also set a rule that if you do not use national products, please do not patronize us.</p>
<p>Hate articles. During the Year of National Products, there were the most articles promoting national products. They were long and verbose, full of empty words, and really annoying. I said that instead of saying empty words, it is better to bury your head and actually do it. When I went back to my hometown to sweep the tombs this time, I met a person selling inferior cloth on the road. He was active in the countryside. My husband and I scolded him severely. Many villagers had some sense of right and wrong and said that this person specializes in selling Eastern cloth and should be scolded. As a result, the bastard ran away with his head in his hands. A very serious servant. One day, the servant bought three boxes of Swedish matches. I blamed her and insisted that she exchange them for national products. People said I was too serious. I said that if I let it go once, she would buy foreign goods again next time.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Understanding the Issue of Women Using National Products <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Songtang</p>
<p>As the call to promote the use of national products is growing louder and louder, gentlemen in the national products industry are sparing no effort in their advocacy work, and they are indeed trying to make progress rapidly. However, upon closer examination of the understanding and use of national products by women in our country, it is still in its infancy. There are many reasons for this, which cannot be described in detail. Here, I offer my humble opinions to the national products production industry for consideration and improvement by those with greater wisdom:</p>
<p>"Insufficient intellect and lack of education." Our country's population is said to be 400 million, and of course, half of them are women. As everyone knows, according to the statistics of the Ministry of Education, more than 80% of the population has not received education, which means that only 20% of the people have received education. Moreover, China's long-standing habit of valuing men over women has not yet disappeared, so the number of women who have received considerable education is actually an absolute minority. During the period when the policy of dumping enemy goods was aggressively pursued, the market was filled with them, disguised and with many tricks. Even knowledgeable people are easily deceived by them, let alone women with a weak sense of awareness who only know that the value is low and cannot recognize these foreign goods behind masks? Therefore, the popularization of education should be the beginning of women's understanding of national products.</p>
<p>"Lack of common sense." Since their intellect is insufficient, their common sense is of course even more lacking. Women in our country have always valued etiquette and mostly stay at home, not knowing what society is like, let alone other things. In recent years, there have been calls for open socializing and advocating for women's occupations, but the number of unemployed men is everywhere, and the number of women with considerable jobs is just a drop in the ocean. Since they have little contact with society and rarely see or hear things, their common sense is naturally not broad. How can they not be fooled by foreign goods? Therefore, the simplicity and profundity of national product trademarks are also an aspect of women's identification and understanding.</p>
<p>"Strong spending power." In the current economic trend, which is becoming more and more turbulent, human consumption is becoming more and more extravagant. In addition, the influences of European and American culture are constantly being imported. The more civilized the material world, the more complicated life becomes. Taking Shanghai as an example, women's daily necessities and clothing, hats, socks, and shirts are constantly being renewed and changed, vying for novelty and beauty, and imported goods account for the majority. May I ask how much can be produced domestically? Although it is said that it is an expression of the vanity of the women's world,</p>
<h3 id="e219">A Virtuous Housewife <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>The housewife is the head of the family, she is the main consumer of social economy, and at the same time, she is the owner of nurturing children and promoting future generations. Therefore, whether from a theoretical or practical point of view, a virtuous housewife should actively take on the responsibility of promoting national products.</p>
<p>Here is the story of Ms. Wang, a housewife worthy of being virtuous, promoting national products.</p>
<p>Before purchasing household items each time, Ms. Wang must discuss the budget with her husband. The first consideration is how to be the most economical, and the second is that she sincerely and kindly asks him to buy national products. Her husband is originally a patriotic young man with passion, and this further strengthens his determination to buy national products.</p>
<p>Every Sunday or public holiday, Ms. Wang's husband can get a chance to rest, and Ms. Wang takes her children to visit the National Products Exhibition Hall or to buy miscellaneous items at the National Products Company. In her opinion, this can prevent her husband from fooling around and wasting money elsewhere, and secondly, it can give the children some belief in using national products.</p>
<p>A relative, Mr. Li, is preparing to get married and sent an invitation. Ms. Wang then asked her husband to issue a gift certificate from the National Products Company to send it as a gift.</p>
<p>In fact, the patterns of domestic products are few and far between, lacking alternatives. In addition, the work and manufacturing are not exquisite enough to attract people. This is also a major obstacle in terms of understanding and use.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the China National Products Company, the public has gained a correct understanding, because domestic products are gathered in one place, making it convenient for purchasers, which is of no small significance. As a measure to popularize women's understanding, even a small trademark should be studied to make it simple and popular. Other aspects, such as the strangeness of the style, the exquisiteness of the work, and the low price, cater to the needs of the public and the psychology of women, are all of utmost importance.</p>
<h3 id="e220">From Her, Speaking of National Products <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Lu Weichi</p>
<p>Speaking of using national products, I can't help but recall her, whom I saw in Nanyang a few years ago. She was an Oriental woman, also residing in Annam, living next door to my house. The clothes she wore were, of course, made of goods from her own country. As for food, she mostly used canned goods produced in her own country. What baffled me most at first was that she would search for many wooden boxes in various cloth shops—wooden boxes used for packing Oriental cloth. It turned out she used them as firewood when cooking. Their family's daily necessities, even the smallest items, were all their own national products, not allowing any benefits to flow out. Their patriotism is truly worthy of admiration! The reason their country is so rich and strong is because their women and children have long recognized and resolved to choose national products. Alas! Speaking of our country, I am extremely ashamed! The conflicts between imperialist powers and their aggression against China are all for the purpose of seizing consumer markets to solve overproduction! China, alas, our Chinese people are still reveling in imported goods, and the erroneous concept of worshipping foreign goods has not yet been broken. If this continues, the future of Chinese national products will undoubtedly decline and fail. What hope is there for revitalization and expansion?</p>
<p>I believe that using national products is a virtue that citizens should possess, and promoting national products is a responsibility that citizens should bear. For the sake of national prosperity and strength, we cannot do without the movement to promote national products. The movement to promote national products should start with women, because women are the housewives in the family and have the power to choose all the daily necessities for the entire family. If Chinese women can emulate that Oriental woman, establishing a foundation of faith in national products, the future of national products can be expected to be bright. Not only that, but women occupy an important position in family education. They can usually do their best to promote the goodness of national products in front of children and how citizens should use national products, instilling in their young minds a good concept of loving and using national products, and planting a firm belief in national products. Dear sisters, since national products have such a close relationship with us, then we should quickly rise up, shoulder our important mission, engage in the movement to promote national products, and do our best to promote the glory of China and develop the outlet for national products.

<h3 id="e221">A True Account of the National Products Movement in Shanghai Women's Circles <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Qia Cheng</p>
<p>The twenty-second year of the Republic of China is considered the year of national products. In this year, we must establish the reputation of national products and, more importantly, confirm our belief in national products, hoping to spread it from cities to villages and complete this important mission. In this great national products movement, it just so happens that our National Products Weekly was born, so we are even more excited to shout.</p>
<p>This self-proclaimed power cannot be complacent, but the Shanghai women's national products movement was inspired by Mr. Yang Yan's "The Responsibilities of Housewives." Because the fact is so, we cannot deny it.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhu Wang Wanqing is a pioneer in the effort of family movement. After discussing "The Responsibilities of Housewives," she thought of the "Family Renewal Association" and "Family Improvement Association" that had been suspended for a long time. When she met Mr. Pan, she talked about the practical work of the women's national products movement, hoping to realize this more meaningful event.</p>
<p>After the planning of the preparatory committee, it was decided to convene a family friendship meeting to contact some progressive housewives and engage in practical work as role models, using facts that are better than eloquence and publicity to awaken women's circles and work together.</p>
<p>The first meeting was held at Shangxian Hall. The number of people who attended exceeded expectations. After many speeches and discussions, it was decided to implement four measures. The situation and records of the meeting have been published in various newspapers, but what I cannot forget the most is that Mr. Shen Xixiang, a seventy-year-old pioneer in the field of education, also came to participate that day. His enthusiasm for the national products movement was no less than that of young people, and this spirit is worthy of our young people's admiration and emulation.</p>
<p>The second meeting was held at Puyushe Kindergarten. Those who attended were all women, sitting on low chairs, still discussing very enthusiastically. Ms. Ge Chenghui gave a speech on "The Responsibilities of Women in the Year of National Products," and the enthusiasm was no less than that of the first meeting.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only the beginning and cannot be fully considered a realization, but if everyone can work hard and start from themselves, the bright future of building several national products families is what we earnestly hope for.</p>

<p>— Shousong</p>
<p>At a time when the national crisis is serious and the voice of the national products movement is noisy for a while, the national products movement in Wuxi is of course also very prosperous. According to the reporter's observation, Wuxi women's understanding of national products has the following two different trends:</p>
<p>Production: Women belonging to this category account for the majority. They spend their days buried in factories and homes, accelerating their production. Women in factories mostly use their hands and feet to operate machines. What they earn every day can maintain their lives and have something left over; those in families mostly do their handmade lace industry, and their income is also quite considerable; although the above are all engaged in the production of national products, they are actually driven by life. They don't have a deep understanding and recognition of national products themselves; as for what they use, it is indeed authentic national products.</p>
<p>Consumption: Those belonging to this category are a small number of "leisured class." What they use, even they themselves cannot accurately recognize whether it is national products or foreign goods. In short, they only seek "fashionable," "eye-catching," "touching," "......" As for what is national products? Why should national products be used? They have no time to care!</p>
<p>In addition, in the business world, there are women's national products stores, etc., but the efficiency is still very low. If you want to promote it widely, I am afraid there is still a need for large-scale publicity!</p>
<h3 id="e223">How Smart Housewives Choose Clothing Materials <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Shaoming</p>
<p>Of the four basic necessities of life, clothing is the first item. Clothing is a tool to protect the body and for the sake of hygiene, one must pay attention to it, which everyone knows, but what we want to study, especially women's clothing, is what kind of material is the most economical, most beautiful, and most hygienic?</p>
<p>Generally, people who advocate frugality say that only cloth is the best, the price is cheap, the style is simple, and it can be washed frequently to maintain cleanliness and hygiene.</p>
<p>However, we have had an experience that tells us that using silk to make clothes is actually more economical and worthwhile than cloth. In our grandfather's era, when we opened the box, we often saw many silk clothes that his father or his grandfather had passed on to him, and our grandfather, inheriting this inheritance, could not only enjoy wearing it himself, but also resize it and make small clothes for his sons and grandsons to wear. This is a fact. When I was eight or nine years old, I did wear the silk clothes left by my grandfather, remade and worn to relatives' houses during the New Year to wish them well.</p>
<p>At least we can understand that silk clothes are indeed more durable than cloth clothes. Because silk is made of silk, it is naturally stronger than cotton yarn and has a longer lifespan. Cloth clothes are easily soiled, so they must be washed frequently, and frequent washing makes them easy to break; and because they are cloth clothes, they are not very cherished when worn, and are particularly easy to stain. Only when wearing silk clothes, one must pay special attention to avoid staining them. Moreover, silk fabrics are less likely to be stained than cloth, so of course there is no need to wash them, or no need to wash them often. Not washing them or not washing them often makes them less likely to break. According to an experienced housewife, the lifespan of a silk garment is roughly equivalent to three or four cloth garments; foreign silk or rayon fabrics are, of course, exceptions.</p>
<p>The beauty and cleanliness of clothing are very important to people's interest or sympathy, especially for women. If they are disheveled, they lose beauty and reduce pleasure, so I think it is best to make women's clothes with silk; as for whether the price is extravagant and whether it is suitable for hygiene, it is also very clear.</p>
<p>Since a silk garment can be equivalent to the lifespan of three or four cloth garments, then we assume that making four cloth garments costs four yuan and five cents for the fabric and four yuan for the labor, then it costs eight yuan and five cents; while the silk price only costs four yuan for the fabric and two yuan for the labor because it is only one garment, totaling only six yuan and five cents. Isn't wearing silk clothes cheaper than cloth clothes?</p>
<p>As for hygiene, silk fabrics are less likely to be stimulated to the skin by sudden changes in climate than cotton fabrics, which everyone has experienced, so silk clothes are also better than cloth clothes.</p>
<p>Recently, foreign goods have been flooding the market. People below the middle class buy foreign cloth or rayon woven fabrics to make clothes, while people above the middle class buy silk fabrics, which have always been very expensive and extremely insecure, with huge annual losses.</p>
<p>This year is the year of national products, and everyone is advocating national products. Many people think that if you want to buy national clothing materials, you can only buy domestic cloth. However, women who love beauty are also complaining that there are too few types of domestic cloth, and the patterns and dyeing are also less than foreign cloth, so they are forced to promote national products and have to buy some domestic cloth to make clothes, but they still go to department stores to cut imported silk.</p>
<p>In fact, they have not noticed that domestic silk factories have also developed very well in recent years. There are many types, and the patterns and dyeing are also emerging endlessly, which are no different from imported goods, and the price is 50% to 70% cheaper than imported goods. We only need to walk into various national products companies or silk stores to visit, such as Meya Silk Weaving Factory's Jiu Man silk, Ningxiang brocade, brocade crepe, plaid double crepe, Liu Tiao double crepe, and georgette, all of which are very good and cheap, and are completely beautiful clothing materials for modern women.</p>
<p>We should not be superstitious about foreign goods, let them increase other people's ambition; nor should we buy inferior clothing materials without thinking. We should carefully consider what is domestic, economical, beautiful, and hygienic before buying.</p>
<p>Experienced housewives probably all know: "Clothing does not differ by an inch, shoes do not differ by a point." If there is a slight uneconomical act, it will be consumed invisibly, and the annual accumulation of a family will be incalculable.</p>
<p>Women do not have to hide the need for decoration, as long as the decoration is within the economic conditions, what is not to be happy about? If you spend money for decoration and promote sales of foreign goods, that is what smart and patriotic women disdain to do.</p>
<p>As for children's clothing and husbands' clothing, they are probably also controlled by the housewife. We also hope that the housewife will think carefully about whether to buy domestic silk for her husband or use her own or her husband's old silk clothes to remake them for the children, which should be considered by the smart housewife. Sometimes, it is very common for a silk garment to be worn old, dyed once or twice, and remade for wearing again; and it is still very neat and beautiful when worn.</p>

<h3 id="e224">National Products in Songjiang <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>This may be a good phenomenon! At the beginning of the first and second quarters of the Year of National Products, it is a very fortunate thing to have such achievements and contributions to national products.</p>
<p>In February, the folk education centers in Songjiang County, in accordance with the instructions of the Education Bureau, held a national products mobile promotion, which did have some results. So they felt that it was necessary to hold a mobile exhibition. In terms of promotion, it is to make the public know the importance of loving and using national products; in terms of exhibition, it is to give the public the opportunity to recognize national products. They were very determined to gather the directors of various museums on February 5 to discuss the progress. They were very happy to cooperate with the China National Products Guidance Institute, and they could realize their wish.</p>
<p>After several contacts and several meetings, the Songjiang County National Products Exhibition, under the leadership of the China National Products Guidance Institute, opened on April 9 at the People's Education Hall.</p>
<p>The building of the venue can be regarded as top-notch in the exhibition. It is divided into two places, upstairs and downstairs, with a total of twenty rooms: Downstairs! 1. Yixin Toothbrush Factory, 2. China Enamel Factory, 3. Greater China Celluloid Factory, 4. Renchangyong Glassware Factory, 5. Hua Fu Hat Factory, 6. Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, 7. Home Industry Cooperative, 8.9. China National Products Company, 10. China Chemical Industry Cooperative, Upstairs! 11. Huachang Steel Factory, Yutai Thermos Factory, 12.13. Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, 14. Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Guohua Battery Factory, 15. Dexin Silk Weaving Factory, 16. Wuhe Weaving Factory, 17. May 30th Sock Factory, 18.19.20. Sanyou Industrial Cooperative,</p>
<p>Each factory tried to outdo each other, posting many moving advertisements to attract many people from Songjiang to come and visit.</p>
<p>That day, Mr. Pan Yangyao also went to Songjiang to participate in the opening ceremony. I also went to Songjiang by car for the company's mission. Before 9:00 am, representatives from various agencies in Songjiang arrived one after another, and the general public also came to buy national products that they had never seen before. However, because the market was to open at 1:00 pm, the gatekeepers stopped them, and they felt very depressed, which shows the effectiveness of "national products"!</p>
<p>The meeting was opened with a bell, following the ceremony. Which one can make people alert and laugh the most is Mr. Pan's speech? The general idea of his speech is this: "......Promoting national products is everyone's responsibility......One day, I went to Hongkou Park and saw a group of Japanese people sitting on the ground. They were resting. Looking closely at what they ate and used, there was nothing that was not Japanese goods. The Germans are the same. They warned their children that even the needles and threads you use should be domestic goods......I think the women have the greatest effect in promoting national products. If a girl has her lover, and the lover likes to use foreign goods, she can decisively tell him, If you use foreign goods, I will not marry you. At this time, the participants in the audience laughed and applauded at the same time. And most of the female students' faces were flushed. Husbands of women who like to use foreign goods, can file for divorce when persuasion does not work applause from the audience was same as before I think if we do it this way, then national products can really become popular!......"</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Pan introduced his teacher, Mr. Lu, to give a speech, which was also pertinent and somewhat humorous, and listening to his tone, he had the demeanor of Tao Xingzhi!</p>
<p>Finally, a photo was taken, and I was also included in it, which is a permanent souvenir!</p>
<p>During this short period of the conference, April 9 to April 22 the people of Songjiang can take this rare opportunity to visit and purchase. Regarding clothing, there are: various fabrics and silks from Sanyou, Hongxin, Samsung, Dexin and other companies. There are also Wuhe's undershirts and spring and autumn shirts. Hwafou Hat Factory's woolen hats, May 30th's socks. For daily use, there are China National Products Company's: "stationery" and "toys," because they are mostly parts, countless, so they discussed the tools for children's education. China Chemical Industry Cooperative's Guanyin powder, soy sauce essence, Samsung toothpaste, various fragrances, vegetarian soap, Home Industry Cooperative's various fragrances and Xuechi powder. Huachang's steel products, China's enamel utensils, Yutai's thermos bottles, Greater China's celluloid toys......etc., each has its own merits, and in terms of price, it is really the lowest price.</p>
<p>They will also go to nearby rural areas to dress up and promote, and also bring some of the products of various factories to let the honest and simple elders in the countryside have the opportunity to recognize national products. I hope that the same action will not be limited to Songjiang alone, but will be popularized to various provinces, counties, towns, and villages, which will definitely become a great work in the true Year of National Products!</p>
<h3 id="e225">What We Expect from Housewives <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Chenghun</p>
<p>"Modern housewives must recognize their goals. They are in an important position. It is not enough to be a virtuous wife and good mother who obeys the three obediences and four virtues and educates their children. They should step into society, integrate with society, and jointly bear the burden of saving the country with national products!" Before writing this article, I must first faithfully dedicate this passage to the general housewives.</p>
<p>Because the majority of society is a collection of many families, and the family is a major outlet for material consumption, while housewives are the masters who manage the family.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation in the past, it can be arbitrarily said that housewives did not have a full understanding of national products. For daily necessities, food, clothing, and enjoyment, as long as the style is satisfactory and the price is reasonable, they are no longer happy to care about whether they are national products or not. The husband happily bought imported goods back, or added one or two foreign toys for the children, and they had no intention of examining whether they were national products! As a result, in Jinli Lane and the Three Companies, there was a lot of traffic, and they worked hard to be volunteer salesmen for foreign goods, which is really heartbreaking to say. This cannot but be blamed on the adults and gentlemen in the past who generally raised their voices and shouted "promote national products," forgetting the housewives in their own homes and the homes of the masses, making the housewives permanently isolated from society. As a result, promotion is just promotion, and foreign goods still have loyal users. This contradictory and alarming phenomenon continues to this day.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the recent trend of national products is gradually approaching women. Some women are very unwilling to lag behind and are paying attention to national products. However, it is not effective to rely solely on high-profile theories and unrealistic promotion. Housewives should first examine their responsibilities in their own positions. That is to say: all utensils and utensils for food, clothing, housing, and transportation in the family, as well as items consumed in social activities and exchanges, should first make a determination "only national products are allowed," and even half a thread, a shoe, or a small towel should have the ambition to "swear to use national products." Secondly, supervising the husband's purchase of items and indoctrinating the children with the spirit of using national products are also the urgent tasks of housewives!</p>
<p>However, women do not have a group that can study and consider the whole. It is always felt that it is too unsystematic to implement it on their own. It is best to form several associations to study and train women's understanding and use of national products in a comprehensive and thorough manner. At the same time, please invite several national products experts to guide them in using various methods to promote to the lower-level women's circles so that all women can raise their heads and pay attention to national products.</p>
<p>Recently, aren't the men and women in the society have an organization called "Family Renewal Association"? This is a good opportunity to strive to instill the love of national products into women. I often think that the preliminary problem of family renewal and family improvement at present is still the use of national products. I hope that many housewives can earnestly follow the society to jointly bear this important mission.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Introducing an Inventor of National Products Condensed Milk <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yuehui</p>
<p>Condensed milk is something that our country has never manufactured. However, it has been sold very well in recent years. According to customs statistics, the annual import amount reaches 20 million yuan. The Chinese people did not try to recover this huge loss. If this continues, how can we imagine it? There is Mr. Xiao Jia Gan who, after feeling painful, determined to make condensed milk himself to replace it. After experiencing setbacks, he finally succeeded. So far, the Yan brand condensed milk cocoa milk, etc., sold on the market are all domestic goods. Now, I will briefly introduce the process of Mr. Xiao's establishment of the condensed milk company for the purpose of commendation.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Jia Gan is a native of Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province. After graduating from the Department of Business Administration of Fudan University in the 13th year of the Republic of China, he served in the Qingdao Shandong Provincial Bank. One day, Mr. Xiao happened to talk with friends about the prosperity of imported condensed milk in China and was deeply angry. He then intended to manufacture condensed milk in order to recover the rights and interests in case of one. However, he thought that he was not a milk production expert. If he engaged in it hastily, it would be difficult to succeed. So he began to investigate. He purchased and read a large number of Western books on milk business, milk product manufacturing methods, etc., and strove to learn for the preparation of practical management.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao's special ambition was determined, so he resolutely resigned from his job in the bank and went south to return to Zhejiang. On the one hand, he taught at the Zhejiang Provincial Commercial Middle School to maintain his livelihood. On the other hand, he joined forces with friends Tu Bushan and Qiu Shilin to establish a sterilized milk company to seek experience. In his spare time, he tested condensed milk production. After 127 trials, he repeatedly failed and then continued to succeed. However, condensed milk machines such as vacuum machines and crystallizers were worth more than 100,000 yuan and had to be ordered from abroad. Mr. Xiao's family was poor. Such a large sum of money was difficult to raise. His ambition was frustrated. One day, he happened to see a slogan hanging on the roadside saying, "Where there is a will, there is a way." He could not help but be deeply moved and determined to be more determined. Then he went to a certain Japanese bookstore and repeatedly obtained the machine books catalog, intending to copy it according to the map. Friends all laughed at him for being crazy and did not believe him. However, Mr. Xiao still encouraged himself to proceed. He often drew machine sketches at the desk at midnight. Although he was often sick, he did not care. In the winter of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xiao followed the drawn sketch and followed its description procedure to implement the imitation of the three sets of vacuum machine sterilizer crystallizer. At first, the material matching was very inappropriate. After many disassemblies, all the machines were finally successful in the winter of the 19th year. So he collected 60,000 yuan of capital and established the West Lake Condensed Milk Company. He purchased cows, built sheds, and added machines. In the winter of the 20th year, he sold Yan brand condensed milk and cocoa milk on the market. At present, overseas Chinese in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Nanyang have come to purchase. It is really cheap (condensed milk is sold for 20 yuan per box, cocoa milk is sold for 30 yuan per box) and the quality is good. Compared with imported goods, there is nothing that is not as good as it is.</p>
<p>At present, the company has more than 1,000 acres of pasture and more than 2,700 dairy cows. The scale is gradually expanding. Xiao is aware that the capital is small and insufficient for development. So he came to Beijing a month ago to state the founding process to the central government and asked for assistance. He was deeply praised by the central committee members Chen Lifu and Yu Jingtang, who promised to find ways to solicit shares. This small amount should not be difficult to raise in the shortest possible time. The company's future is immeasurable.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Worth Introducing Chongqing National Goods Introduction Center (Part 2) <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>According to the value of goods imported into Sichuan Province in the past three years, the annual value is approximately 30 million taels, of which foreign goods account for about 80%. The outflow of economic rights is considerable. In addition, the farmers in our province follow old habits, which are not perfect. Not only is the cost of imported goods higher, but also the collapse and escape of farmers in Shanghai have led to the gradual disappearance of the Sichuanese community's credit in Shanghai. The process of the Sichuanese community generally purchasing goods in other ports is as follows:</p>
<p>Each level charges fees, and each level divides profits. We should find ways to eliminate these practices to reduce the cost of goods. We have been planning this for a long time. This year, Mr. Zhang Yujiu of the Bank of China came to Sichuan, and we discussed the lack of vitality in the national goods sales market and sought ways to improve it. We deeply agreed on this issue, and then initiated the organization of the China National Goods Introduction Center. In June of this year, the initiators publicly elected Mr. Tong Shaosheng and Mr. Chen Shujing to go to Shanghai to investigate and negotiate. We were warmly supported by Mr. Zhang Gongquan and guided by important figures from the Bank of China to visit more than 40 national goods factories. We negotiated with each factory to establish sales methods. Because we urgently needed to prepare internally, we only stayed for more than 40 days before returning to Chongqing. The center was officially established on October 1st and began its introduction work. Based on the center's organizational motive, we plan to simplify the aforementioned goods purchasing process as follows:</p>
<p>From the diagram above, our center is essentially the factory's exclusive agent and the direct representative of the Shanghai China National Goods Production and Sales Association. This reduces some unnecessary waste. With the support of the Bank of China, our center can purchase goods on behalf of customers, reducing costs and simplifying procedures. At the same time, the Sichuanese community's credit in the financial circles of other ports may be slightly restored with the establishment of a statutory and organized group. In short, the organization of the introduction center is essentially a public buying agent for the Sichuanese community to purchase goods in other places. It aims to make the greatest possible contribution to local firms or wholesalers, without any intention or tendency to encroach on their interests. The center's economic objective is based on saving various fees to promote the sales of national goods, and there is no conflict with the interests of various firms or wholesalers.</p>
<p>The features of our center are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(A) For Manufacturers</p>
<p>(1) Limited company registration with legal protection</p>
<p>(2) Manufacturers' trading partners can be simplified</p>
<p>(3) Cost-effective and useful advertising services</p>
<p>(4) Market research can be requested by letter to the center</p>
<p>(5) Suggestions for improvement are always welcome</p>
<p>(6) Direct sales by the factory, striving to expand the target</p>
<p>(B) For Merchants</p>
<p>(1) The latest product samples can be selected locally</p>
<p>(2) Only a 30% deposit is required for the factory to ship goods</p>
<p>(3) Payment and pickup upon reaching the order</p>
<p>(4) Exchange rates can be settled at any time within 30 days</p>
<p>(5) Flexible financing can be arranged if funds are occasionally lacking</p>
<p>(6) Sincere service regardless of quantity</p>
<p>However, this is a pioneering effort, and we lack experience. We hope that patriotic and enlightened people will not hesitate to offer advice to correct our shortcomings. We would be grateful! The future of national goods would be fortunate!</p>

<h3 id="e228">A Glimpse of the Children's Amusement Market Held by the China National Goods Company (Part 2) <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Turning into "National Goods Avenue" from "Ooh-Ooh Road," a long line of "cars," "carriages," "airplanes," "bicycles," etc., are arranged in the center of the avenue. On both sides are signs for "parking." Next to "National Goods Avenue" is "Innocence Road," displaying "children's clothing": Zhongshan suits, school uniforms, world suits, knitted and cotton suits, as well as shirts, undershirts, bibs, diapers, etc., all displayed in a very interesting way. In the "Socks Department," they piled many socks into the three characters "Children's Day." There are also "cosmetics," "pharmaceuticals," etc., all displayed there.</p>
<p>The new-style equipment on "Jump-Jump Road," such as "tanks," "machine guns," "rifles," etc., will make children feel that they must have a martial spirit to contribute to the country! "Little Girls" are making various pleasing poses. Celluloid lions, tigers, dogs, horses, etc., also have a "can't be subdued by power" look.</p>
<p>"Run-Run Road" is a "children's food world," displaying many kinds of candies and biscuits. There are weapon-style candies, which are very novel. When Yang'er saw many tank-style candies, he liked them very much. He said, "I want to use them to fight our enemies in the future." I bought two for him and said to him, "But don't forget after you finish eating the candies!"</p>
<p>The horses, carriages, bicycles, horse-drawn carts on "Lively Road," as well as small "steel essence," "electric powder," "porcelain," "electric appliances," etc., are very suitable for children's psychology.</p>
<p>There are many slogans posted in the market. Now I will introduce several to children who have not participated in the inland:</p>
<p>(1) Parents should buy some national goods for children on "Children's Day" of "National Goods Year."</p>
<p>(2) Children! From an early age, you should hold on to the tenet of "buying national goods."</p>
<p>(3) Parents! Guide your good children to use national goods.</p>
<p>(4) "Children's Day" is happy, and "buying national goods" is even happier.</p>
<p>(5) I hope that all the supplies for children are made of national goods.</p>
<p>(6) National goods are beautiful and inexpensive. Do children like them?</p>
<p>(7) Children, this is a good opportunity for you to learn about national goods.</p>
<p>(8) These are our pure and excellent children's items. Please come and appreciate them.</p>
<p>(9) Children! Which one do you like? Please ask your parents to buy it back.</p>
<p>(10) Children, don't forget the two words "national goods."</p>

<h3 id="e230">Abolishing Taels and Changing to Dollars: A Hundred Combinations <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>"Abolishing taels and changing to dollars" is a bloodless revolution that should be specially recorded in the history of Chinese finance.</p>
<p>An "old-timer" in the "silver money industry" said that exchanging silver for silver dollars, then converting silver dollars back into taels, and then converting taels back into silver dollars, with "two adding one and making five, three adding one and making thirty-one," requires continuous calculations on the thirteen-bead abacus, as long as there is an entry, no matter how troublesome. It can turn one tael of silver into no money at all, just like a Shandong villager performing magic.</p>
<p>The co-existence of "taels" and "dollars," is it harming the people or harming business? We still need "national experts" to express their opinions, but the "tael" is causing trouble in the financial world, and there is ironclad evidence of this.</p>
<p>In fact, the "tael" does many evil things. For example, European and American countries are very affectionate to our country on the one hand, and secretly flirt with Japan on the other hand. This is "two-faced." Northern China is fighting with Japanese soldiers, fists and feet, cannons and knives, while in the South, they still shake hands with the Japanese, promoting diplomacy and friendship. This is riding a "two-headed horse." Let's talk about family problems. One son inherits two lines, marrying two wives, called "two big heads." But "three days early at the temple gate makes you big," even mud bodhisattvas must follow two rules and follow one order, newcomer slow down, no courtesy, at most give a title "vice wife." If not, the family will be in trouble, and the kitchen god will move house, and from then on, the family will have many problems.</p>
<p>The Ming Dynasty Kangxi Dictionary says that "tael" means "two," and "dollar" means "one." "The great road loses sheep because of many forks." The great road of life, having one is enough. We Chinese are wandering everywhere, just suffering from not being willing to "stay with one to the end" and "go all the way to the end." "There are no two suns in the sky, and no two kings for the people." You want to be a hero, I want to be a good man, this road is not open. Now, "abolishing taels and changing to dollars," everyone starts from scratch, and perhaps China can be saved. Someone said, "Abolishing taels and changing to dollars, one becomes two, and two becomes one!" Alas, "this is really A Yuan wearing a hat, it's over!"</p>
<h3 id="e231">Two Kinds of Wrongfully Dead and Drunken Fools Live <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In Shanghai, every year during the "spring" and "winter" seasons, there are often many people who "die unjustly." These "wrongfully dead" people die in two different ways, but both are sacrificed due to carelessness in their diet and daily life.</p>
<p>In the spring months of February and March, newspapers often report news of "death from eating pufferfish roe poisoning." Most of the victims are laborers from Jiangbei. They pick up pufferfish roe in garbage cans, or buy pufferfish roe cheaply, and after cooking and eating it at home, they develop poisoning, with abdominal distension and pain, writhing and screaming, and mostly die after ineffective treatment; some even die as a whole family. Good people sacrifice their precious lives for the sake of satisfying their appetites. This kind of death can be considered "wrongful death."</p>
<p>In winter, when the weather is cold, newspapers often report news of "death from coal briquette poisoning." They are also economical families, living in small rooms, and when it's cold, they burn coal briquettes for warmth and close the windows tightly. Because the air is not circulating, they are poisoned by coal gas. People gradually faint, and some die as a whole family from poisoning. Readers can only sigh after reading the newspaper: "Poor 'wrongful death'?"</p>
<p>The above two kinds of "wrongful deaths" continue to occur during these two seasons, like clockwork articles. The reason for this is that they lack common sense and are unaware of the danger. We also have to blame social education for not being popularized, which leads to such ignorant people and such tragic results.</p>
<p>According to medical records: pufferfish are highly toxic. Decoction of reed root and olives can be taken to detoxify. The roe is even more toxic. Soaking it in water overnight will make it as large as gorgon fruit. Those who are poisoned can be effectively treated by quickly stir-frying Sophora japonica flowers and grinding them with dried rouge in equal parts, mixing with water and administering orally. Because poisoning from eating pufferfish roe is often fatal, it is specially noted here for reference. Both items are available in pharmacies.</p>
<p>Gengdi on Fire and Snow Ming</p>
<p>At noon, the sunlight thinly spills on the cultivated embankment, applying a layer of hazy color. The fine grasses of the winter stretch their lazy waists, breathing in the exotic fragrance of the fields. The wind blows faintly, and the grass dances its green shirt, startling the white butterfly clinging to it, which flies away.</p>
<p>Along both sides of the river are all ridges, overshadowed by willow trees planted every five steps, so the grass is not easily scorched. The willow leaves are long, and the color has changed from tender yellow to emerald green, clinging to the swaying branches, some lowering their heads to look at their own postures in the water, and some straightening their bodies, staring at the distant spring sky, but all reflect their shadows on the calm warm waves.</p>
<p>In order to breathe in the air of the spring fields, I dragged my rattan cane and strolled to the riverside. After passing the stone bridge, I came directly to the cultivated embankment. Standing on the embankment, I leisurely pondered in the vast expanse of nature, the warm breeze was blowing, the sunlight was bathing, and the subtle sounds of nature were playing, so I could forget the difficulties of the past and covet the interest of being out of the world. So I stopped.</p>
<p>In the silence, the sound of water suddenly rang out, as if paddles were hitting the water surface, and a faint whistle came from afar. Looking back, a fishing boat floated down on the narrow, other end of the azure stream. The slender boat, like a piece of seaweed, gradually approached. It could be seen that the sides of the boat were full of black, long-beaked birds, which we call "touching fish public" in our hometown, which are actually the cormorants mentioned in the Erya. Du Gongbu's poem "Jiangzhong Xunhe He Feiyan," the Xunhe is this kind of waterfowl that is best at catching fish underwater.</p>
<p>The fisherman, holding a long bamboo pole and blowing a whistle, drove the cormorants into the water. They plunged their duck-like necks into the water, and after a long time, they came up, accurately spitting out two or three fish from their mouths. Because their necks were tied with ropes, even though there were fish in their mouths, they still could not swallow them to satisfy their hunger. This seems to be a Lesson also for those who make wedding clothes for others.</p>
<p>As usual, the fisherman grabs the cormorant's neck, hangs it upside down, and the cormorant raises its head, and then instinctively hangs down, spitting out carp or white small fish from its plough-like beak. The fisherman catches it easily and puts it in the basket, and then laughs. The cormorant itself doesn't understand for whom it is living.</p>
<p>No matter how far the fishing boat sails, the cormorant will follow the fishing boat underwater, just like a released white pigeon will fly back thousands of miles; the value of each cormorant is thirty yuan at most.</p>
<p>Gradually, the fishing boat passed through the river bay, and the black-feathered waterfowl was still diligently working. The fisherman leisurely supported his bamboo pole and whistled, shielded by the green shade of the willow, and then could no longer be seen.</p>
<p>Although I have no feelings and no sorrow, if I am not a cormorant, why am I also looking for fish for others day and night!</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Wendi and his classmate Mr. Ma Tingdong obtained a large jadeite stone five or six years ago. They carved it into a pagoda, two palace lanterns, and an archway. I took the time to view them a few days ago. The pagoda is divided into seven stories, more than three feet high, with electric lights inside, radiating precious light and full of emerald green color. The two palace lanterns are carved with landscapes on the outside. The green parts are carved into mountains and forests, full of verdant green, extremely beautiful. According to Mr. Ma, it took several years of effort and hundreds of man-hours to complete this crystallization. The executors are slightly negligent, and all previous efforts will be wasted. I heard that you will be taking them to the American exhibition for display soon. I said that this is enough to promote the magic of our country's carving and the greatness of art, not just to show off precious treasures for a while. On that day, many Westerners were among the appreciators. Dr. Mei Lanfang and scholar Zhu Fuxiu also came to a stop. (Payment declined)</p>

<p>Chapter 4: The 情局 Resumes at the Teahouse, Accumulating Affection; the Year-End is Difficult to Pass, the Pawnshop Makes a Mournful Sound</p>
<p>Walking to the door of the milk tea shop, Ji Zhi rushed forward and said: It's here. Pointing at the door of the shop. Gui Zhi twisted her body and said: Second Master, please go, I'm not going. Ji Zhi said: Now that we've come to this door, why not go in and sit for five minutes? Please, please, please. Saying that, he used all his strength, only to be polite. At this time, Gui Zhi couldn't help but hum slightly in her nose, seeming to sigh, so she had to follow him in a reluctant manner. In this milk tea shop, three tables were placed outside the counter. Ji Zhi looked at it. Although there were no customers at this time, he didn't want to sit in such an open place, so he looked around. He hadn't said anything yet, but a waiter sitting by the stove warming himself had already come forward and said with a smile: There are elegant seats inside, there are two elegant seats inside. He had already led the way, lifted a white cloth curtain, let them into an outer room, and put down the door curtain by the way. Ji Zhi thought to himself that even though Haidian was a town, it had opened this kind of business similar to a café in the city, and there were indeed waiters who understood business to entertain them. After Gui Zhi entered the room, she didn't sit down, but only raised her head to look at a framed landscape painting hanging on the wall. The waiter brought in two hot towels, and asked with a smile: What would you two like to eat? Ji Zhi then asked Gui Zhi what she would like to eat. Gui Zhi took the towel in her hand, rubbing her hands together, but she still looked at the landscape painting. She casually replied: I'm easy. Ji Zhi thought that she wouldn't drink coffee, and ordered an lotus root powder for her: he ordered a cocoa for himself. He also greeted her to sit down, please sit down. Gui Zhi took off the scarf on her body, sat opposite Ji Zhi, and kept folding the scarf on the table. She lowered her head, didn't speak, and didn't look at Ji Zhi. When the waiter brought the food, there were originally plates of dry snacks on the table, so he didn't have to come in. Ji Zhi took two sips of cocoa, and then put two pieces of cake and peach cake from the plate in front of her, and then said: Please use a little. Don't misunderstand me and be angry with me. I'm eating my brother's food now, don't think I'm a second master, I don't dare to offend any of the servants and old maids in the family. Because of this, even if they offended you, I can't do anything. (40)</p>

<h3 id="e235">Mei Lanfang's Recent Conversation <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Wheel</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang is currently living in Shanghai, and occasionally travels to Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other places. Yesterday, when the reporter met him, he inquired about the number of grains, and the answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) I saw in the newspaper the other day that Mr. Zu Bu had a conversation with Mr. Song Chunfang, in which he discussed the idea of adding Western music to Chinese dramas, and mentioned Mr. Li Shizeng's words about the bodhisattva sitting on an airplane, is this true?</p>
<p>(Answer) I am very familiar with Mr. Chunfang. I did have a conversation with him about drama the other day. The real content was: Mr. Song advocated that the music of Chinese dramas should be improved. Since he is not an expert in music himself, he asked for my opinion. I replied that I also think it needs to be improved, because I think that the music of Chinese dramas is indeed too simple. I have long held this view and have had various trials. For example, since I came on stage, I have restored the four-stringed moon lute; added the Suhu to set off the Huqin; added the Jiu Yin; added the碰镜; and applied the drum to dance. All of these were promoted by me, and have become fashionable on the stage for fifteen or sixteen years. But I still think that the music of Peking opera is still insufficient, so when I was in Beiping, I created two kinds of Huqin, one high-pitched; one mid-pitched; and one low-pitched. Unfortunately, the results of the trial were not satisfactory, so I once intended to add Western music to Chinese dramas. But my intention is only to participate in the creation of Cantonese opera stages, which is admirable, but it seems that more cooperation and improvement are needed. As for talking with Mr. Song, I did not mention Mr. Shizeng and the bodhisattva sitting on an airplane, because I only saw this in the newspaper this time, and I couldn't even talk about making any explanations (Question) I heard that you intend to not play the role of Dan or change to playing the role of Xiaosheng in spoken dramas due to your age, is this true?</p>
<p>(Answer) I think it's okay to sing a few more years according to the precedent in the drama world, but I have to perform the appropriate dramas. Now I haven't considered this issue in detail. As for changing to playing the role of Xiaosheng in spoken dramas, I am very willing to study it, but there is no possibility of trying it without pure research.</p>
<p>(Question) The newspaper reported that you have the intention of playing Madame Butterfly with Ms. Hu Die, as well as various sound films, is this true?</p>
<p>(Answer) I only know about the Madame Butterfly thing from the newspaper. I have only met the stars in the film industry at the banquets of various film companies. As for sound films and any film dramas, I am considering them, and I have not made any decisions with any companies. The so-called 100,000 yuan performance of Farewell My Concubine is also an April Fool's Day style news. Finally, Mr. Mei told us that the reason why he stayed in Shanghai was because he was a native of Suzhou, so he planned to visit the spring scenery of Jiangnan in time. He also plans to visit the ports of the Yangtze River in the near future, and it is not certain whether he will go to Mount Lu.</p>
<h3 id="e236">The Abnormal Phenomenon of Women's Occupations <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Silver Thread</p>
<p>Women's occupations in today's society have long been in the same position as men. But in practical observations, it is still a kind of deformed development recently. A certain organization published an advertisement to recruit female employees, and as a result, Ms. A and Ms. B, two women with graceful figures and charming appearances, were selected after a strict selection process. They have been working with peace of mind since then, and they are very happy. But sitting there all day long, except for a few colleagues who often joke and tease them, they are simply holding positions without doing anything. After more than a month like this, Ms. B had already become intimate with them, getting along like fish and water. Ms. A, on the other hand, was the exact opposite, always maintaining her icy and stern attitude, never showing the slightest smile. And being in such a boring environment, she was even more secretly surprised and did not know what was going on. A few days later, Ms. B suddenly came to visit, and said a word of special representation of male colleagues to clearly express and persuade her to change her mind, otherwise, please leave early and make other plans. Ms. A then woke up as if from a dream and suddenly understood. It turned out that the two of them were hired by a joint venture of several colleagues, not employed by the organization. It is said that the purpose of their employment is to adjust the boring atmosphere in the office!</p>
<p>This novel anecdote is indeed a side shadow of women's occupations in a deformed society. We really feel very sigh. At the same time, I watched a movie similar to this, "Women's Cry" by Mingxing Company. It made me even more emotional. This film gives a realistic description of the corner of women's occupations. The description is painful and powerful, and moving. It is a good work needed by the times. Originally, "Cries" are the tragic cries of the oppressed. I don't know what the female compatriots will think after reading it?</p>

<h3 id="e237">Saving the Nation Through Leisure <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>"During times of national crisis," one can discern the busyness of important figures from the newspapers. Thus, while it's not necessary for every important person to have their own airplane, anyone with their own airplane is undoubtedly an important person. Soaring through the clouds, flying high and low, today "inspecting" somewhere, tomorrow "overseeing" somewhere else, in Beijing in the morning, yet in Shanghai in the afternoon – how swift and convenient! The so-called "entire plan" and "determination to resist Japan" are all conceived on these airplanes. And once they realize the difficulty and retreat, they can transfer the plane to another important person as a farewell gift, a sign of continued reliance, "another task for you," to mark their unforgettable service. The use of airplanes is truly significant.</p>
<p>However, from the newspapers, one can also see the leisurely and self-satisfied demeanor of these important figures, poised and at ease. For example, in the newspapers a few days ago, there was a news item with a floral border about "Chairman □'s Leisurely Interests." According to my experience reading newspapers, news items with floral borders are particularly valuable. This headline is tantamount to saying: even the Chairman has become so leisurely, naturally the world is at peace, the national crisis has passed, and the people can well "play mahjong." The gist of the news was that "Chairman □ today visited an old bookstore in plain clothes to purchase several ancient books and antiques," and walked back to his office. (Note from Da: Because it was a special dispatch, this sentence was not in the telegram, probably to save on telegraph fees, so it was not detailed.) As the Chairman, buying a few ancient books and antiques is naturally a minor matter, and since national etiquette does not prohibit playing golf or dancing the Charleston, it certainly does not prohibit buying old books and antiques. Moreover, removing official attire and going out in plain clothes is much more respectable and endearing than traveling in a high carriage with four horses, with attendants shouting and clearing the way.</p>
<p>However, the phrase "plain clothes" somehow reminds me of the officials in old novels who were known for their integrity and fairness, "traveling incognito for private visits," and the young masters and sons who committed great disasters and "fled in disguise." Fortunately, Chairman □'s "plain clothes" trip was to buy books at an old book stall, and there was no danger. In earlier times, private visits and escapes were always worrying. However, this also shows the composure and calmness of the important figures, at ease and self-possessed. On the same day's newspaper, there was also a piece about General □□□, who was overseeing the military operations against Japan in Beijing, agreeing to go hunting in the suburbs with British Ambassador Lampson on the 12th.</p>
<p>The fact that important figures still have leisurely interests in the face of national crisis has "existed since ancient times," according to historical records. The most famous example is the Battle of the Huai River. Not only were the Qin troops far beyond the Great Wall, but they also crossed the Yellow River and directly threatened the Huai River. Yet, Prime Minister Xie An remained composed and played chess without changing his expression. Zhuge Kongming's playing the zither to repel Sima Yi in the novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is also a "leisurely interest" that has been passed down to this day. Up to the present day, when the Shenyang Incident occurred, the young marshal was still in the midst of singing and dancing; during the Battle of Shanghai, there was a sudden decision to develop the Northwest; when Rehe fell, the overseeing figure suddenly moved from the north to the south. These are all examples of the "leisurely interests" of important figures. And the three northeastern provinces, Jinzhou, Yuguan, and Chengde, all changed their colors amidst the leisurely interests of the important figures. What is buying a few ancient books and antiques? Who knows, buying a few ancient books and antiques, or going hunting, might repel enemy troops like Xie An's chess or Zhuge's zither?</p>

<p>— Shu Ji</p>
<p>After half a day's journey by water, it was already five o'clock when the small steamboat approached the dock. I stretched languidly in the cabin, leaned on the boatman's shoulder, and jumped onto land; the gentle breeze blowing from the water secretly dispersed the weariness that had accumulated from living in Shanghai for two years. Raising my eyes, I gazed eastward; that city, full of the stench of flesh, the clamor of machinery, the colors of decadence... seemed to be still faintly visible beneath the misty white clouds.</p>
<p>! Ah, farewell, wicked Shanghai!</p>
<p>With a slight sigh, I lifted my feet and strolled along the bank towards the village nestled among the trees nearby. The wheat seedlings by the roadside gently swayed their heads, as if welcoming their long-lost master. The green mountains buried in the afterglow of the setting sun, the stream shimmering with golden light, the fisherman crouched by the river, the shepherd boy riding on the back of an ox, and the scenery that I had previously overlooked, now filled me with wonder. My eyes were like the camera of a greedy photographer, insatiably swiveling in all directions.</p>
<p>With the shyness and joyful demeanor of a newly married bride, I walked into the gate of my home, secretly arousing the astonishment of my neighbors; even at dinner time, they still surrounded my mother, as if trying to ferret out some fresh news.</p>
<p>After nine o'clock, I left my family and went alone into a quiet study. I brewed a pot of tea, invited an elderly man who didn't cough much to chat, while I lay on the bed; a red candle was lit beside the bed. I opened the window, letting the wind blow in, gently shaking the flame; the entire room seemed to tremble. The old man sat beside me, mournfully telling me the stories of the village in the two years since I had left. At first, I was quite excited, but soon, I was disappointed, and tears flowed.</p>
<p>The night deepened, and he lazily left. The room was so quiet that even the sound of mice could be heard. Outside the door, the wild dogs barked madly, each bark striking my heartstrings. The stories that had just been etched on my soul silently unfolded before my eyes: In the late spring season, the rain fell day after day, incessantly.</p>
<p>Mountain torrents erupted丨the dikes broke丨</p>
<p>The water丨buried the fields, submerged the stone steps, the floors, the houses...</p>
<p>Women, children... clinging to wooden rafts, branches, rooftops... crying miserably, their cries broken and intermittent...</p>
<p>················</p>
<p>The water receded.</p>
<p>On the mountains, below the mountains, in the small river, the corpses of water buffaloes were scattered like stars!</p>
<p>Bacteria丨丨Epidemics丨丨Coffins丨丨Welcoming the Gods丨</p>
<p>There was no harvest for the whole year, yet taxes had to be paid.</p>
<p>Land tax! National crisis donations! Militia donations!</p>
<p>The poor! Reactionaries! Executions!</p>
<p>··················</p>
<p>The jumbled, fragmented memories bit at my heart like maggots. The ideal rural life I had been pursuing for two years was destroyed in an instant.</p>
<p>The next morning, before the sun had even climbed to the top of the mountain, I quietly boarded the steamboat again, returning to "wicked Shanghai" as before.</p>

<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(17) Zhang Taiyan on the Poor and Suffering Classes</p>
<p>Recently, regarding Mr. Zhang Taiyan's attitude towards the revolution, whether he inclined to the right, the left, or any other direction, we do not wish to comment and leave that for future historians. However, it is beyond doubt that Mr. Zhang was one of the most left-leaning and radical figures among the party members when he resided in Tokyo during the Tongmenghui era. This can be said to later generations, and there is evidence in surviving issues of the Min Bao. In his long essay on the morality of revolution, he stated that the morality of today largely changes with one's profession. If we categorize people by their occupations, there are sixteen types: 1) farmers, 2) workers, 3) peddlers, 4) merchants, 5) scholars, 6) artists, 7) intellectuals, 8) soldiers, 9) clerks, 10) advisors, 11) business managers, 12) court officials, 13) regional officials, 14) military officers, 15) government officials, and 16) translators. There are sixteen levels of occupation, and the order of their morality also has sixteen levels. Although it is not uniform, one can get a general idea. From artists upwards, they are generally within the realm of morality. Below intellectuals, few are virtuous. The higher one's position, the further one is from virtue. Living with artists and intellectuals is certainly not as enjoyable as living with scholars; living with scholars is certainly not as enjoyable as living with farmers, workers, peddlers, and merchants; living with employed professionals is certainly not as enjoyable as living with unemployed children. He also said that farmers are the highest in morality. They labor with their minds and bodies, working diligently throughout the year. The income from their fields and gardens is enough to support themselves, and they are unaware of the schemes and deceptions of the world. When they encounter officials, they are very cautious and fearful. If there are greedy and cruel officials who relentlessly extort them, they will rise up in rebellion. And when they die for it, they accept it as if it were candy. Workers are slightly more aware of fraud and deceit. They sometimes cheat the market with shoddy tools and flimsy materials, but they are also very strong and unyielding, no different from farmers. Mr. Zhang directly ranked farmers and workers as the highest in morality, followed by peddlers and small merchants, and then by intellectuals who do not hold high positions. From the so-called famous scholars and intellectuals to the bureaucrats, warlords, and comprador class, the lower they are, the lower they are in morality. As for placing soldiers in the same category as intellectuals, he probably did not know that soldiers come from the farmer and worker classes, and many join the ranks because they are unemployed and have no support. Also, in the Min Bao's anniversary celebration, Mr. Zhang himself wrote a speech discussing the strength of revolutionary spirit, stating that the bandits and secret societies of the poor and suffering classes were the strongest, followed by the intellectuals of the petty-bourgeois class, while bureaucrats and warlords were counter-revolutionary. The text was in vernacular, and a summary is as follows:</p>
<p>The current revolution is commonly called "scholars rebelling," while previous revolutions were commonly called "bandits forming alliances." Bandits have strength, while scholars lack strength; bandits do not rely on officials, while scholars rely on their superiors. Therefore, when bandits rise up, they do not rely on governors and viceroys, while scholars want to rely on governors and viceroys to achieve great things. This is truly foolish. Some people say that scholars are not as good as secret societies, and secret societies are not as good as bandits. In my opinion, let's not talk about the level of knowledge, but bandits never have the intention of relying on officials to rebel, secret societies have a little bit of that intention, and scholars have even more. In terms of their base ambitions and weak self-confidence, they cannot help but feel ashamed compared to secret societies and bandits.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of past revolutions, those who rose up from the grassroots used simple, honest, and diligent people, and swept away the malpractices of the previous dynasty. If powerful vassals invade or powerful ministers usurp power, the politics will be the same as in the previous dynasty, with no reforms at all. Because although the emperor is changed, the officials remain the same. The corrupt and greedy customs of the previous dynasty are passed down and cannot be swept away. The current situation in the officialdom is that microscopic worms and germs are spreading poison everywhere. If it is not a revolution of the common people, how can we avoid these miasmas? If we carefully examine Mr. Zhang's words and look back at the Chinese revolution of the past twenty years, it is not difficult to fairly judge the reasons for the failure of the Xinhai Revolution and to evaluate what achievements the recent revolution has made.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"The streetcar was delayed, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Haiquan replied with a smile. But in his heart, he thought, damn it, does he have to act so bossy?</p>
<p>"You were supposed to be here at twelve o'clock, you should have prepared earlier!..."</p>
<p>Yaoxing's attitude seemed to have softened a bit.</p>
<p>"Hurry up, you still have time."</p>
<p>The young man with the cap said in an old-fashioned tone.</p>
<p>"Yes..."</p>
<p>Seeing Yaoxing's respectful attitude towards this young man, Haiquan quickly took out a bundle of printed materials from under his bed and handed them to Haiquan.</p>
<p>"Hurry to the road behind the Bund Park near the Baidu Bridge, and when you see them shouting slogans, distribute these leaflets to the crowd on that side. There are many dockworkers on that side, it's best to scatter your leaflets to the workers!..."</p>
<p>Haiquan felt a little scared in his heart, but he had to take the large bundle of leaflets. His chest was also thumping.</p>
<p>"Hurry up!"</p>
<p>Tang Yaoxing commanded as if he was issuing orders to him, Haiquan had no choice but to take the streetcar to the Bund with a trembling heart.</p>
<p>Sure enough, near the Baidu Bridge, behind the Bund Park, he saw thirteen or fourteen young people who were supposedly comrades. Some, like him, were holding a bundle of printed materials, some were holding short bamboo poles wrapped in colored paper, the flags for the parade. He saw two female comrades from afar. Their attitude seemed calmer than that of the male comrades. Their attitude of putting life and death out of mind gave Haiquan a lot of inspiration. So he became as nervous as they were. Haiquan glanced at the comrades again, each was pale, like a dying person, and their expression was extremely tense, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p>
<p>Haiquan inadvertently looked across the road, and he found that Li Yixiang and his friends were also pacing back and forth in front of the Japan Mail Steamship Company. They all had their hands behind their backs, holding a book in their hands. When Haiquan saw Mr. Li Yixiang, it was as if he had found a clear spring in the desert, so happy that he wanted to shout. He looked at both ends, and when there were fewer vehicles, he quickly crossed the road and walked to Mr. Yixiang.</p>
<p>"Mr. Li!"</p>
<p>He cried out. He thought that when Li Yixiang saw him, he would be as happy as he was. And he could also show Li Yixiang that he was now participating in practical revolutionary work.</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, oh."</p>
<p>When Li Yixiang saw him, he only said "oh" a few times, and his face showed a kind of displeasure. Haiquan felt directly that Mr. Li was just not saying that he didn't know him. At the same time, he noticed that when Mr. Li looked at the bundle of printed materials in Haiquan's hand, his face showed a look of fear. Li Yixiang frowned, moved his jaw slightly, as if telling him to hurry back to the other side of the road. Seeing Li Yixiang's cold attitude, Haiquan also felt half cold, he inadvertently glanced at the large volume of Western-style books in Mr. Li's hand and recognized it as the Old and New Testaments. The books in the hands of the other two literary figures were Western books, and Haiquan had no mood to examine them further. When he returned to this side of the road, before he had even stood firmly, he saw that the comrades had opened their colored paper flags with slogans written on them, and the leader in front shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Down with imperialism!"</p>

<p>Mediocre Half-Day Trading, Volume Light</p>
<p>The gold market trended downwards yesterday, but the half-day's process was mediocre with light trading. In the early morning, foreign telegrams showed that both near and far terms in London were up by .5625, New York silver prices also rose by .375, forward silver prices rose by 0.02 to 0.038, private telegrams increased by 0.1875, American cotton also increased significantly by 0.11 pounds. Coupled with the very firm position of silver spot, the morning opening fell to $1086.50. The initial gross opening in the market was $83.4, Yuan Chun entered bids and rose to $86.7, but Yuan Mao Yong sold. After the opening, it still showed weakness. The foreign exchange market also opened strong, but due to tighter recent US dollars, banks closed out positions, briefly breaking through the $90 level, reaching $1090.50. Later, banks released forward US dollar positions, gradually easing. HSBC's quoted rates for both British and American currencies increased by .0125, the forward exchange market continued to be firm, and the gold price trended downwards. Finally, news came from foreign telegrams that the United States intended to purchase silver for coinage purposes to make preparations, and it retreated to $83. Bank appetites were still moderate, and buyers emerged on the low. Therefore, the closing price returned to $1085.80. Trading was not strong during the half day, and the trend was flat. Although Zha Chi's [premium] was said to be 16 yuan, it later continued to increase to 18 or 19 yuan. The spread between April and May was about 8 yuan. The current term spread seems to be more expensive than this price. The half-day's market conditions are recorded on the left.</p>

Heng Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, and others immediately entered bids, and it gradually rose from $5.80. Although Heng Xing and Bing Xing sold, it rose to $9 due to the need for banks to close out US dollars for this month at .06875. Zhejiang offered US dollars for July at .00625 and retreated to $7.2. At this time, the foreign exchange market was still good, and sentiment was also good.

Heng Xing and Fu Chang sold even more, falling to $83. Mitsui took in US dollars for July at .00125, and Yuan Mao Yong took in. There was a lack of people responding, and it was raised higher and higher, to around $5. The foreign exchange market was still flat. Banks needed US dollars for July at .00125. Ri Chang entered again, and it rebounded to $6. At this time, it was already approaching the closing time, and trading was even smaller, with slight ups and downs. Before long, the noon closing was $1085.80. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Wednesday. After the close, Heng Xing continued to sell off, retreating to within $5, so items were auctioned off at $5. It was found that the highest price during the half day was $1090.50, and the lowest price was $1083, with a $7.50 fluctuation. As a result, it continued to fall by $6.80 compared to the previous close.</p>

Thereafter, transactions were generally at an additional 18 or 19 yuan. Ying Feng Heng had taken in over a hundred taels, calculated at an additional 18 yuan, sold by the customer gang.</p>
<p>The swap between April and May was extremely quiet, but the premium was expensive, due to the time factor. Hui Yuan paid Da Shun 14 items, at 8 yuan, and paid Da Feng Heng 7 items, at 7.5 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong paid Da Feng Heng 35 items, also at 7.5 yuan. 4018 items remained for April's transactions.</p>

<p>[Interbank Call Loan] Interest Rates as Low as 0.02</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the silver and money industry's entry and exit settlement amounts were not as strong as at the beginning of the week, they were still considered not weak. However, the situation in the market is currently quite sluggish. Since the foreign cent [coins] were abolished, there was no price to open, and there was no room for competition. Even the daily interbank call loan rate was roughly the same in the morning and afternoon. Therefore, whatever was done in the morning market was immediately followed in the afternoon. Because the market was depressed, there was no possibility of ups and downs. Yesterday it was again 0.02, decreasing by 0.01 from the previous day. The premium was also 0.02 or 0.03.

<p>Trading is Sparse, Prices Rise Slightly by 1-2 Jiao to 5-6 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the public bond market saw no increase in trading, and buying and selling were extremely sluggish. However, since the environment has not changed much, and the Russo-German conflict is gradually worsening, it is believed that the Japanese may be overwhelmed with dealing with the situation, and the domestic situation may stabilize. People's confidence has slightly strengthened. In the morning, the demand for No. 11 bonds was slightly higher, and retail investors were also more inclined to buy than sell. The market price generally rose by 1-2 jiao to around 3-4 jiao. In the second session, sporadic retail investors still showed interest, but there were very few sellers, and the price rose another 2-3 jiao. In the afternoon, the situation became slightly chaotic, and the trend showed slight signs of fatigue, but it still did not break away from the circling pattern, mainly because there were many observers, and the trading volume did not improve at all. The market prices of various bonds could be freely raised or lowered with the inflow or outflow of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, which shows how light the trading was. The final market price rose slightly by 2-3 jiao to 5-6 jiao. The total turnover was only 4,580,000 yuan, of which 5,000 yuan was in spot transactions, and 4,575,000 yuan was in futures.

However, the shares of the Chinese Merchant Exchange, which had not been traded for a long time, suddenly had a transaction of 10 shares, priced at 40 yuan.</p>

<p>A report from Sinfeng Trading Company stated that on Tuesday (the 11th), the New York stock market was slightly weak due to profit-taking by bulls. The total trading volume for the day was 1.43 million shares. Speculators are now paying close attention to Senator Borah's proposal to make short selling transactions public. Wheat continued to rise due to government reports favoring the bulls. Considering all aspects, it seems that commodities will rise again, and the stock market will also advance accordingly.

<p>The yarn market is calm, but most people still expect prices to fall because sales are sluggish, and there are many sellers taking advantage of the rise to sell short. However, the overseas cotton industry shows signs of a turnaround, and some people also have the intention to go long. It is heard that the Sichuan merchants have initiated a large number of transactions, but their prices are too low and have not been concluded, and negotiations are still underway.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry announced the export statistics for the tea market in the first quarter. The export and re-export figures of tea in this port in the first quarter of this year (from January to March) increased by about 20,000 dan compared to the same period last year. Among them, direct exports from Shanghai increased by 4,378 dan, and re-exports increased by 15,800 dan. However, the increased figures were for green tea and brick tea, while black tea saw a decrease. Direct exports of green tea from Shanghai amounted to 33,180 dan, and re-exports were 187 dan, totaling 33,368 dan, an increase of about 4,500 dan compared to the total re-exports of 28,912 dan in the same quarter last year. By country, exports to France increased by over 1,200 dan, the United States increased by over 1,100 dan, and Africa increased by 1,000 dan, but exports to Russia decreased by 1,000 dan compared to the same quarter last year. Other countries such as England and Hong Kong saw slight increases and decreases. Re-export volume was not as high as in the previous quarter, decreasing by about 80 dan. Local merchants in the black tea area said that the market was poor, but some still shipped here. Yesterday, 2,000 bags of Hunan rice were loaded by Qingpu, further impacting the market. Merchants specializing in the export sent urgent telegrams to the origin to stop shipping, and it is said that the batch that arrived yesterday was the last batch after the order to stop shipment, as it had already been declared and had to come. In the future, it is necessary to wait for a turnaround before shipping can resume. However, the market price of Xiang rice has fallen by 1 jiao and 4-5 fen, and high-quality rice has not yet opened for sale. Mid-range goods are seeking to be sold due to price depreciation, and prices have fallen by about 2 jiao. The market has once again fallen below the 8 yuan mark. After the market price fell slightly, it was able to attract Fujian merchants to purchase actively. The daily transaction volume was 1,420 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed rice at 7 yuan, 9 jiao, 3 fen to 6 fen, and 660 bags of Hunan machine-processed oil at 8 yuan, 3 jiao to 05 fen.

<p>After the opening prices of the flour market both up and down, the prices for near and far months rose consistently. The strength of the rising wind was even greater than the previous day's falling wind. The previous day's falling wind was fast, and yesterday's recovery was even sharper, and the amount of the increase even exceeded the amount of the previous day's fall. There are many reasons for the increase, the most important of which is the continued rise in foreign wheat, and it is even more difficult to reach an agreement on orders. Factories originally wanted to sell, but now they are covering short positions. Foreign wheat is still expected to improve, attracting purchases from merchants and retail investors, and there are also many short-covering transactions. Yesterday morning, it had already risen by several points, and continued to rise in the afternoon. As a result, April was up by 1 fen, May was up by 75, June was up by 2 fen, July was up by 2 fen 25, and August was up by 2 fen 5.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, foreign wheat was reported to be rising, and people's sentiment was positive. The prices for near and far months turned around consistently. However, in addition to the foreign wheat that had been previously ordered arriving in Shanghai, there was also a lot of spot goods in Shanghai, and the market was suppressed accordingly. Long-term orders were difficult to place due to high prices, and there had been no orders for a long time. Yesterday, the telegram reported a rise, making it even more difficult to reach an agreement, so July and August were up by 5 fen each, and September was also up by 3 fen. This month was only slightly better by 1 fen.</p>

<p>The standard gold price fell by more than 20 yuan continuously in the previous two days, causing people's sentiment to trend towards weakness. The Sugar Association's standard prices were as follows: No. 24 coarse grain white sugar was initially called at 21 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen, but later dropped by 5 fen. No. 20 medium grain white sugar was 20 yuan, 0 jiao, and 7 jiao. Nos. 8-9 Dutch red sugar was 17 yuan and 1 jiao. There were no transactions. Only Chao merchants offered dozens of packages of branch sugar at 19 yuan, 2 jiao to 19 yuan and 05 fen, which was slightly better by about 1 jiao compared to the previous price. The market for other domestic sugar goods was stable and temporarily unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Broadcloth Trousers Fall in Price Due to Season <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Broadcloth trousers are specially made for spring and autumn coats, especially popular in autumn. The goods are divided into first and second grade. The Kongshi brand is older, and the highest price sold last year was 7 taels, 7 qian, and 5 fen. Haohua goods are slightly inferior, and the highest price sold was 6 taels and 5 qian. The cost this spring was cheaper, with Haohua opening at 5 taels and Kongshi opening at 6 taels, 2 qian, and 5 fen. Recently, there has been a sharp drop. Yesterday, Haohua reduced sales to 4 taels and 6-7 qian, and first-grade goods were 5 taels, 9 qian to 6 taels. This is mainly because the late spring season has arrived, and the weather will soon be hot, causing the sales floor to be sluggish. If they are left until the second half of the year, they will incur interest charges. Moreover, the cost of Haohua goods is only 4 taels and 4 qian per yard, so the current market is making some profit.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Flannel Sells Well Due to Season <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>The flannel market is selling very well. Western-style clothing is currently being made, and large and small Western-style tailors have been purchasing them recently. Gray plain colors have the largest sales, followed by stripes. The market for women's colors is also not bad, but there are no original piece transactions. Yesterday, Shunquanlong pullover flannel was sold for 3 taels and 4 qian, Hanping for 3 taels and 6 qian, Meizuishi for 2 taels and 7 qian, 5 fen, Zhengchang for 2 taels and 4 qian, 5 fen, Yixing first grade for 3 taels and 1 qian, 5 fen, and second grade for 1 tael and 7 qian, 5 fen. The sales of white flannel are slightly inferior, but those who order it are extremely few. Due to the shortage of goods, the price has increased. Hualun Rongtai goods are sold for 5 taels and 1 qian net.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Silk and Tea Industries Implement Abandoning Tael System and Adopting Yuan System <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>After all commercial businesses in this city obeyed the Ministry of Finance's order to implement the abandonment of the tael system and adoption of the yuan system on the 6th of this month, all transactions are calculated in silver dollars. The purchase and sale of raw silk by Chinese and foreign merchants, the selling price has always used the silver standard. Since foreign banks have stopped dealing in taels, the silk industry also follows the abandonment of the tael system and adoption of the yuan system. All raw silk contracts sold by Chinese silk merchants to foreign firms, the silk prices are calculated in silver taels, are calculated by converting one tael to 7 qian, 1 fen, and 5 li in silver dollars. From today onwards, Chinese and foreign silk merchants negotiate raw silk transactions, all priced in silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Artificial Silk Transactions Also Converted to Silver Dollars <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Foreign firms in this port that sell European and American rayon usually sell rayon based on the listed price and convert it to taels. Therefore, the Rayon Association negotiates transactions in taels. As foreign exchange rates, such as pounds and US dollars, have been converted to silver dollars at a rate of 715 from today, the export quantity is calculated in silver dollars. The quantity exported was 4,929 dan, and the quantity re-exported was 3,864 dan, totaling 8,793 dan. Compared to the 9,599 dan exported and 2,406 dan re-exported in the same quarter last year, totaling 12,005 dan, this represents a decrease of over 3,200 dan. Among the export figures, exports to the United Kingdom and the United States have slightly increased, while exports to Africa have decreased sharply by over 5,500 dan, and France and Hong Kong have also decreased. Re-export figures increased by 1,400 dan compared to the previous quarter. Exports to Russia and the United States increased, while exports to the United Kingdom, France, and Hong Kong all decreased. The export volume of other teas increased by about 4,800 dan in this quarter, and the re-export volume increased by 14,000 dan. The most important factor for the increase in the above figures is that a large amount of brick tea was exported after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. The other reason is that last year, tea merchants were in urgent need of funds during the Lunar New Year and had to sell at a loss. Foreign merchants took advantage of the opportunity to purchase in moderation and transport it overseas. As evidenced by the transaction volume in this quarter being less than that in the same quarter last year, and the tea price falling drastically by about 30 taels compared to last year, it can be seen that overseas sales are still not optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e264">Current Situation of Tunxi Tea Market <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Tunxi is the center of the tea market in southern Anhui. There are 60-70 tea firms in the town. In recent years, foreign merchants' appetite for goods from Wutun Gaozhuang has been keen, and market prices have also risen. Tea operators are still relatively successful. However, over the years, there have been rapid and drastic changes in the tea routes of various countries, sales appetites have become sincere, and market prices have fallen to their lowest level. Tea firms have suffered, and the impact is no less than that on Wuyuan, but it is also the most severe blow in nearly ten years. Black tea is about to be launched, and green tea is also about to be launched. Tunxi tea firms have a cold attitude, and the wharf is also mainly tightening its release of remittances. At present, there are few firms preparing to open the market. However, upon observing the reason for their coldness, it is found that firms do not increase or decrease their operations due to the tightness of silver. In reality, the overseas tea market has not yet turned around, and market prices have not yet rebounded. The current main points of Tunxi tea firms are two: first, mountain prices must be low, and costs must be reduced; second, the overseas tea market must have a turnaround. If one of the two is feasible, then the number of tea firms opening in Tunxi this year may not be greatly reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Number of Fuliang Tea Firms Reduced Compared to the Past <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Fuliang black tea suffered significant losses last year due to sluggish overseas sales, sharing the same fate as Qimen black tea. This year, Fuliang tea firms are mostly unable to recover from the heavy losses of the previous year. In addition, the Shanghai wharf is becoming more stringent in its release of remittances to Fuliang, and only a small number of firms have received tea tickets. With limited financial resources, the number of firms has naturally decreased. At present, in addition to the well-established tea firms that do not rely on line payments and can still open their markets as before, the rest are temporarily deciding whether to proceed based on the situation. As of now, there are more than 20 tea firms opening markets in Jiangcun, Pancun, Baimaogang, Yutian, Guixi, Qiongong, and other places in Fuliang. Although there are many others that can open markets, they are all financially weak and hope to obtain low mountain prices and attempt to purchase tea on credit. If silver remains tight and small firms seek cash, then these tea firms may find it difficult to proceed smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="e266">Ode to Peace <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>If we are still very concerned about national affairs and still believe in the reports in the newspapers every day, then we can clearly understand that the corner of Northeast China is now full of peace. Obviously, this does not mean that Japanese imperialists have ceased their ambition of aggression, but rather that our China loves peace deeply and is constantly "luring the enemy in deep." However, it is a pity that there is no clear provision as to where the "deep" will reach, and if every "national hero" understands the mystery of this "strategy," then the enemy can be allowed to penetrate all the way to the south bank of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Thus, this is highlighting China's virtue of deep love of peace.</p>
<p>However, not every Chinese person loves peace. Sometimes, this virtue is a bit unreliable. For example, sometimes if you accidentally step on someone's foot in the tram, it is inevitable to resort to violence. If someone snatches your seat in the theater, it is also inevitable to resort to violence. Even in all other needle-point-sized events, it is common to lose all civility. This is to say that since everyone is Chinese, of course, they will make the most noise, just like the current situation on both sides of the Yangtze River, where people are really killing each other until blood flows like rivers and corpses lie everywhere, which is so lively. From this, it can be seen that Chinese people's love of peace is only for external consumption, while it is not necessary internally.</p>
<p>Under the banner of peace, the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have been offered to Japan as a big stage for wooden puppet shows. The Shanghai war, which sacrificed countless lives, was also "agreed upon" under the banner of peace. The last province, Rehe, will of course be allowed to be invaded by the enemy under the banner of peace. Presumably, closing the iron gate of the Great Wall, in any case, the Volunteers may not completely turn into cannon fodder for a while. If you pack up your valuables and move, you may not be too rushed. However, many poor people are unwilling to "suffer because of peace" and advocate fighting hard, clenching their fists, firmly opposing imperialism, and permanently consolidating peace. However, this kind of cry is ultimately because they have no tongue, and it cannot resound through the clouds for a while. Therefore, everyone can only end up wearing a garland of peace and dancing on the tips of guns and knives.</p>
<p>Peace, many people dream about it day and night. Only most people will one day uncover the illusory curtain of peace.</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>A stack of newspapers has been lying under my desk for several days without being read. It's not that I'm too busy, but I seem to feel that reading the newspaper is a torment. After not reading them for three days, I made it a habit to throw the daily newspapers under my desk. Today, a relative came from afar in the countryside. As a "young" (not old) Shanghainese, I had to invite them to see our splendid world. Opening the current Shen Bao local supplement, I seem to have grown a few years younger. The old tricks that I used to flock to as a student are now being revived in the cry of "Aviation Saves the Nation." According to the instructions of the Public Works Bureau's Film Censorship Committee, children under the age of seventeen are not admitted to cinemas. There are seven or eight dance troupes that use women's flesh as their gimmick. Even more, there is a special note: "Today is the last day. To benefit the audience, there will be an extra performance of American dances. Children under the age of sixteen are not allowed to enter." This indicates that there is a good show to watch here.</p>
<p>Before September 18th, Shanghai was playing these tricks. After the loss of Rehe, Shanghai is still playing these tricks. Except for the January 28th Incident, when the Japanese dared to offend the gods, we ruined our homes to alleviate the disaster and donated silk cotton jackets... to win a patriotic title. Now, Shanghai is still the same Shanghai. We are still playing the old trick of saving the nation without forgetting the sensual.</p>
<p>At the same time, I am fortunate enough to see the headline "The non-resistance general and his family boarded a ship last night and set sail this morning." The culprit who caused the January 28th Shanghai War has quietly gone abroad to play golf. What do Shanghainese think of this? Although I heard that someone dared to throw a bomb at the former large gambling den at No. 181, the general's headquarters before his departure, the general still languidly went to a foreign dance hall to dream butterfly dreams. The general committed a heinous crime but was not harmed in the slightest, and he majestically took his family abroad amid farewells. But to be fair, besides arguing with rickshaw pullers over a single copper coin, Shanghainese have always been generous. Please, General, don't have any lifelong regrets on the Conte Rosso! Don't you see that "Singing and dancing (the singing and dancing of the XXX Dance Troupe) bring peace" has long brought peace to the world. As for taking away a few ancient calligraphy and paintings from the Summer Palace and selling a</p>

<p>Naval hospital, that's even less of our concern. Farewell, General, we wish you "smooth sailing and may you turn back to shore!"</p>

<p>— Zhou Gongmou</p>
<p>Willows greet people, vying to open their eyes. The wind carries the sound of cuckoos, full of resentment. Pennant shadows and paper ashes obscure the wild colors, a desolate smoke shrouds the spring city.</p>
<p>A hundred flowers bloom in anger, covering the slopes. The millet and sorghum are scattered, causing much regret. The remnants of the fortress and broken walls echo with the cries of new ghosts, but the heroic spirit endures, protecting the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Wild pears contain tears, willows unfurl green. The wind swirls dust and sand, the grass and trees are rank. The dimmed rivers and mountains evoke thoughts of heroes, regretting the lack of long-term plans to comfort their spirits.</p>
<p>Twenty years of fleeting light evoke a sense of passing waves. Revisit, and the temples are already gray. The desolate Guyi Garden is no longer what it once was, a few weeping willows accompany the dodder.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Died in Vain <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxing</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Peiping: "The families and troops of Su, Ma, Li, and Wang, more than a thousand people, have been living in the New World Building since returning from Soviet Russia. Due to the cramped space and extreme filth... more than ten people have died of infectious diseases in recent days..." The subordinates of Su, Ma, Li, and Wang, who resisted for a year and did not die under the hail of bullets, ended up dying of illness in the cramped and filthy New World Building in Peiping. This makes the reporter feel the following thoughts. The troops of Su, Ma, Li, and Wang fiercely resisted the enemy in the snow and ice of the Northeast for a whole year while being ravaged by the brutal Japanese. In the end, although they inevitably suffered a crushing defeat and retreated into Russia due to running out of ammunition and supplies, the fact is clear that they have demonstrated the spirit of the Chinese nation to the world. They have added several pages of glory to China's history, giving the world powers a surprise and giving the brutal Japanese some lessons. How should we, the compatriots who are temporarily living in ease, admire and worship these national heroes who have added glory to the nation? At the very least, I think we should express our respect and sympathy to them! Now, the national heroes Su, Ma, Wang, and Li's troops, who have added glory to the nation, have returned from Moscow; and among them, unfortunately, more than ten people have died of illness due to the cramped and filthy conditions of the New World Building. The national heroes who sacrificed everything for the nation's honor; unfortunately, they suffered a crushing defeat due to running out of ammunition and supplies and returned to their motherland, but even some good treatment was not given to them, and they even died of illness. Regarding this point, I think most of the blame can be attributed to the incompetence of the Chinese government, and a small part can be attributed to the irresponsibility of the Chinese people. In fact, what a big deal is this? Being able to allocate the New World Building to accommodate them returning from Russia is already a great blessing. Isn't the country currently in an economic panic? People are being asked to recognize the emptiness of the national treasury and are rushing to issue national salvation bonds, national salvation funds... and do not have the leisure to entertain the subordinates of Su, Ma, Wang, and Li, who are now irrelevant to them. China now needs people who buy and subscribe to national salvation bonds, not the remaining subordinates of Su, Ma, Li, and Wang who survived the resistance against the brutal Japanese; but, all said and done, it is only unfair to the national heroes who died in the war of resistance against Japan, and the remaining troops and families of Su, Ma, Li, and Wang who survived the sacrifice. The only way to survive is to struggle!</p>

<p>Mr. Baobao:</p>
<p>After reading your letter, I was reminded of a situation two years ago. I also encountered a similar incident, which I still regret. Therefore, I believe that young people who lost their education early are too unfortunate.</p>
<p>Your letter seems to be a backlash prompted by "unfairness," shouting for many young people who have suffered misfortune but aspire to learn. This is necessary. In such a contradictory society, one can hear the same cries everywhere; but in the end, it is in vain. I believe it can only influence a generation with a small amount of persistence; shouting is shouting, exams are exams, qualifications are still qualifications. No matter how loudly you shout, even if you shout yourself hoarse, those who think they are extraordinary will just "go their own way." They will never be moved to agree with you, or express regret that "you have considerable ability but no diploma."</p>
<p>My old friend K, after graduating from a five-year high school, had to serve society with the knowledge he was not satisfied with due to hardship. He is very capable and performs very well, so he is very competent in his duties. Last year, he wanted to improve his status and once applied for an exam in a certain agency, hoping to obtain a more advantageous position. After all, his fortune was not good, and his luck was bad. He was strictly rejected by the chief examiner: the reason was that "diplomas from unregistered schools are invalid." He - my unfortunate old friend - stated that all schools were unregistered four years ago, and he graduated four years ago. His statement clearly hoped that there would be room for flexibility, but the chief examiner, who claimed to be "selecting true talent," only shook his head repeatedly, and finally there was an inevitable fierce debate. He ran away in disappointment and told me about his experience. Finally, he added: "I really don't understand why they take exams so seriously? After admission, it's 'official business is handled, no official business means reading newspapers and dozing off.' Why are they so lax? Those jobs are not something ordinary people can't do, why bother so much about the exam?" I smiled silently, smiling at him - my Mr. K - he already understands that society is like this, but he needs my explanation.</p>
<p>"This is a contradictory phenomenon of society. In this contradictory society, you have to be smarter, say contradictory things, and do contradictory things to be a 'modern' person" - this is how I explained it to him.</p>
<p>Sir, what do you think? It is indeed very difficult for people like us who do not have the strength or sufficient time to pursue higher learning. If you think that a square hat qualification - within your possible range - is at least necessary, or that it is absolutely necessary to have super deep, try your best to move forward. But I want to ask you to use a microscope to examine the entire situation of society carefully, you will definitely see the owners of square hats complaining that there are too few pawnshops and worrying about where to pawn their square hats!</p>
<p>It's not that I like to say unmotivated and unproductive words. For people like us who have no power, too much knowledge is useless in business. Just a considerable degree is enough. (Perhaps you think otherwise, because I don't understand your situation, please forgive me.) I often think... In the current situation, which is more important: knowledge or ability (ability refers to economics and experience)? My prejudice is that knowledge is indeed necessary, but ability is even more indispensable. Having knowledge without ability is like having a boat without oars, which won't work. So I dare not say that what the students of the two top business schools you mentioned will be completely suitable for our country's society in the future! I am even more confident that it is not that there is no true talent and therefore incompetent, and that those who have ability but lack knowledge cannot stand and make a living. Then, why should we waste time and lose our jobs to engage in this metaphysics? Therefore, you do not have to worry about the business school. You must know that the true meaning of the two words "knowledge" is that you can learn and ask at any time and anywhere. Only ability is achieved through struggle.</p>
<p>Struggle! Friend! Struggle hard! I wish you</p>
<p>Happiness Jiang Rendi</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Jiang said that the letter from Mr. Baobao, published in this column on April 4th, is a backlash of "unfairness." But isn't this letter from Mr. Jiang also the same? Moreover, the degree of indignation is excessive. In this kind of society, naturally, everyone can't avoid complaining! You said, "Having knowledge without ability is like having a boat without oars;" that's certainly true. But we think that "Having knowledge without ability is like a big boat, but it also has sails and oars," of course, it is difficult to move an inch. But "Having ability without knowledge is like a small boat, even if it has two oars," it will inevitably capsize in the face of wind and waves. Only "Having both knowledge and ability is like a big boat, equipped with sails and oars," can it ride the wind and waves. Therefore, we still cannot help but shout the slogan of "Equal Educational Opportunities," hoping that people in society will shout like this, and shout loudly. The result of this shout may not be equal to zero!</p>

<p>When he was treading through the snow, he was still painfully worrying and repenting, no wonder he couldn't get excited. How would Jufen know? Estimating that he was always troubled by other things, she deliberately put on various expressions of excitement and joy to please him, but this only increased his pain. He almost wanted to leave her and escape from the park alone.</p>
<p>"...Suddenly my stomach hurts a lot, let's go back quickly!" Although he didn't escape alone first, he couldn't stay in the park any longer, so he made up a lie and tricked Jufen out of the park, sadly saying goodbye.</p>
<p>On the day when the snow in Zhaofeng Park completely melted into flowing water, Wu Yi had taken his wife and son from Shanghai to Nanjing, and his position as Dean of Academic Affairs at XX University was also resigned without a trace. At that time, it happened to be the beginning of the spring semester, and Wu Yi accepted the appointment of the XX Political School a week after arriving in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The problem of occupation was solved without any effort, but how to solve his piece of lost passion? He first went to the Confucius Temple every day to listen to the singing of those little girls who "know nothing of the Han Dynasty, let alone the Wei and Jin Dynasties," hoping to find a new pleasure, but he got tired of it in less than five days. Then he tried to use playing cards with friends as a way to relieve his sorrow, but he didn't succeed either.</p>
<p>One day, he passed through a narrow and secluded alley and saw a burly man, dressed in rags, bareheaded and barefoot like a coolie, drinking until his face was as red as pasted red paper, laughing and singing all the way as he crashed out of a small hotel.</p>
<p>"Hey! Dad of Ada! There's no rice for dinner, hurry up and find a way!" A woman with a sallow complexion came and grabbed the big man's arm, begging him with a smile.</p>
<p>"Haha! Let's talk about it at night!... Innkeeper, bring it over, yellow..." The big man didn't seem to hear it, forcefully opening the woman's hand and staggering away.</p>
<p>"Haha! Drinking is really the most delicious!" Wu Yi muttered to himself very proudly, hiding aside. Immediately, he suddenly realized that in the vast world, the only thing that can really relieve people's worries is "only wine." From then on, he made drinking a daily routine, and often drank himself so drunk that he was unconscious. Nanjing Su Xin Jian</p>

<h3 id="e272">New Works from the Anglo-German Film Industry Union <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Xinpu</p>
<p>"Peach Blossom Village" and "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night" Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>For the past twenty-five years, the global film industry has been dominated by the United States. However, in recent years, Germany, which is unwilling to lag behind, has been struggling and striving to compete with the United States. Although they have strong ambition, they are afraid that they do not have enough talent, so they have united with the United Kingdom to use the strength of the two countries to compete for the dominance of the world film industry. The companies that have cooperated are currently holding the reins of the film industry in both countries, one is Ufa of Germany, and the other is Gaumont of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>"Peach Blossom Village" (Happy Ever After) and "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night" (Tell Me To-night) are the new works from the Anglo-German film industry union's first attempt to show their edge. When they were publicly screened in Europe and the United States, not only did the European media vigorously promote and praise them, but the American newspapers and magazines were also full of a surprising tone. These two films have now been transported to China. Let me first give readers a brief report on the contents of the two films.</p>
<p>The story of "Peach Blossom Village" is a story of a love triangle in the proletariat, with some bitterness in the sweetness. "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night" describes the romance of a singer. In terms of consciousness, these two films do not have anything special, but they can use beautiful photography, novel music, clever editing, and profound description to make two purely artistic masterpieces. What is most commendable is that they can make the most of the natural beauty of the countryside in these two films, giving rise to endless pleasure.</p>
<p>A London newspaper said: "Peach Blossom Village" has a screening time of eighty-six minutes, and "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night" has a screening time of ninety-one minutes; but when it was released, many friends said why the film was so short, as if it had been screened in two or thirty minutes!" The meaning is that the film is so good that the viewers spent the actual time without realizing it. From this point of view, we can prove the enthusiasm of Western Europeans in welcoming these two films.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors, I may as well report first. The main characters of "Peach Blossom Village" are Lil Dagover (the heroine of "Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dance", who has now gone to Hollywood) and Jacques Holbert (the main character in "Happy Marriage").</p>
<p>The main character of "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night" is Jan Kiepura, a singing titan worshipped by European men, women, and children. Among the several actors mentioned above, only Lil Dagover and Jacques Holbert are known to us, and the others have not yet met the people of Shanghai, but Jan Kiepura's singing voice and all the other actors will leave a deep impression in the minds of thousands of movie fans, just like these two films.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e273">Review of "The Sign of the Cross" <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Linghe</p>
<p>The Sign of the Cross</p>
<p>A tragedy promoting Christianity</p>
<p>Excellent directing, excellent performance</p>
<p>After watching "The Ten Commandments" or "The King of Kings", we know that Cecil B. DeMille is a skilled bourgeois film artist and also a most loyal Christian. Of course, any religion has its believers, and many of these believers try their best to preach for the religion they believe in. Moreover, if we believe that a certain religion is often used by authorities to become a tool of rule, then this "preaching" has its political significance.</p>
<p>Cecil B. DeMille, like Griffith, the director of "Seventh Heaven", has had great success in their film art field, and at the same time, they have tried to explain the conflicts or contradictions of the current society under the "glory" of "God", at least to make the audience forget reality with this "spiritual influence". Therefore, we can definitely say that they are only technically successful, and their ideology can only win the praise of the smallest part of the people.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, we can find the most obvious evidence in this "Tne Sign of the Cross". The Roman dynasty at the peak of feudal power may have been as promiscuous and brutal as described in this drama. They sang and rejoiced in the burning city, they were extremely promiscuous, they fed the people to the beasts and regarded it as a carnival, they cheered and laughed at the cruelty of the people's melee. But these people were a flock of sheep, they only succumbed under extreme tyranny, and did not dare to resist in the slightest. A group of so-called "loving" and "kind" Christians had to die sadly in the loud sound of hymns. Obviously, this only illustrates the horror of feudal power, and does not give any slight criticism to feudal power directly. On the contrary, it even praises the great merits of feudal power. Especially in order to insert a love story, a high-ranking official of a dynasty was actually bewitched by female beauty and gladly sacrificed himself with the Christian dissidents. It is really a so-called whimsical idea, not knowing its meaning. Perhaps it is praising the "sacred" and "great" love.</p>
<p>But the director's skill is really extraordinarily successful. After watching it, all the "sensual" and "beasts" necessary for current American films are fully used, but they are not forced insertions, but are important parts of the drama, becoming the natural development of the plot. That kind of directing technique, although (it is his old way, but still does not lose its perfect effect. If we want to illustrate with examples, then the palace in the flames at the beginning, the beautiful shot when the captain of the guard entered the play. After a young Christian was arrested, Mark's knocking on the door of the woman's house was intentionally tense. The queen and Mark stood in front of the grape basin to talk about love. The cries in the fire trap. The sadness of the large number of Christians before execution, and the solemn singing, and the light that poured down from above. Others, such as the child's laughter in the solemn sermon, and the ignorant laughter at the time of execution, and the relative writing with the old man, and the heroine's weeping, are all the best scenes that can move people to tears. Furthermore, the director does not forget the cross everywhere in the play, which is of course the center of the play, but it is also very vivid. The skillful and appropriate performance is of course due to the director's command, but the achievements of several important roles must be admitted anyway. Other aspects are all excellent, and there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>In short, this is a film that is most successful in performance techniques. In this film, the characteristics of bourgeois films can be seen. Although we cannot ignore the history of American films and the perfection of all its production conditions. However, in the intention of the play, they are all estranged from us, at least for the general non-Christians, they may not be able to be greatly "influenced".</p>
<p>Finally, I think this film title should not be translated as "Luogong Spring Colors", because it does not match the content of the film too much, and it loses the focus of the play. Moreover, good films are definitely not called upon by the name of "fragrant and beautiful".</p>
<h3 id="e274">Famous Soviet Female Director <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>

<p>15th Anniversary of Drama Life</p>
<p>This year is the 15th anniversary of the drama life of Natalya Sats, a famous female director in Moscow. The Soviet Ministry of Education and the Theater Department plan to jointly hold a celebration. In 1918, the lady was only fourteen years old and organized the First Moscow Soviet Children's Theater. In 1921, the Moscow Children's Theater was established, and the lady served as director, playwright, and set designer. Since the establishment of the theater to this day, a total of 3 million children have watched the theater, and 42 new dramas have been compiled, among which the two dramas "Black Child and Monkey" have been performed as many as 250 times.

<h3 id="e275">Review of "The Horror Hole" Doctorx <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Heart</p>
<p>"The Horror Hole," originally named Doctor X, was one of the biggest films of the leading national company last year. Carlton has been running previews for over a month; it finally premiered yesterday. Before the film began, there were ten stage performances of song and dance.</p>
<p>Regarding the song and dance, I am not in a position to comment much here. However, I believe that the selection of performers for this "World Song and Dance Troupe," although including some actors from the previous "All-American Song and Dance Troupe," is more brilliant than the previous two. Another point to note is that this time it doesn't overemphasize the women's legs.</p>
<p>The plot of "The Horror Hole" leaves us with a very vague impression. It says that murders often occur when the moon is full. A Doctor X and a newspaper reporter are trying to find out the truth. So, in Doctor X's laboratory, he gathers four scientists, believing that the murderer is one of them. Therefore, he has a male and female servant stage a fake murder, intending to use scientific methods to detect the murderer's mood and evidence. His deputy is a disabled man. The first night fails, and one of the scientists is killed instead. On the second night, because the female servant is ill, he asks his daughter to play the role of the victim in the fake murder. It is then discovered that the murderer is the disabled deputy. The case is handled entirely by the reporter, and Doctor X's daughter marries the reporter.</p>
<p>The purpose of this script is to instill terror and demonstrate the omnipotence of science. There are inherent irrationalities that are beyond human understanding; for example, the motive for Doctor X's research and the reasons for the murderer's killings are not clearly explained. The terrifying parts in the entire film are actually few and far between, and it deviates from the scope of detective films. However, the various difficulties fully demonstrate the director's competence, with surprising suspense set up everywhere. However, sometimes the revelations come too quickly. Although his intention is to make people feel humorous, using laughter to regulate the tense atmosphere, it actually has the disadvantage of being too scattered and lax. There are also quite a few minor flaws. In ordinary films, these would not be regrettable, but in a horror film, they appear as too large of loopholes. Therefore, the director can be considered successful overall, but a failure in parts, especially since he should not have used a humorous approach, undermining much of the serious terror.</p>
<p>The actors are generally above average. In horror films, inner expressions are hardly possible. Only Fay Wray, who plays Doctor X's daughter, is somewhat better. Lee Tracy, who plays the newspaper reporter, frankly fails to live up to his past reputation, which is annoying.</p>
<p>The sets are ordinary. The displays and equipment in those scientific laboratories are very good and can rival those in "Frankenstein." The lighting is also good, and the work on the camera is commendable. The scene transitions are good, but errors can also be found, such as conflicts in time. There seems to be too much dialogue. The pronunciation is too heavy, also losing the possibility of terror.</p>

<p>Gary Cooper threw a grand banquet one day, inviting sixty couples. He prepared a good band and carpets for them to dance. But that day, the banquet adopted a freestyle approach, that is, putting various foods on the table, allowing guests to take whatever they wanted. The dance music played and played, but no couple came out to dance. They just surrounded the table and feasted!</p>

<p>One day, Pickford went to the countryside to shoot location scenes. Fairbanks, dressed as a Turk, lay in wait on the road, wanting to scare her. Her ox cart indeed arrived beside him, so he jumped out and shouted at her: "Hands up! Put everything down, and I'll spare you." Before he finished speaking, a torrential rain suddenly arrived. Thus, this fake Turk got an outdoor Turkish bath first!</p>

<p>— Plum Blossom</p>
<p>During the hail of gunfire, amidst the shouts of people and neighing of horses, Orlov also recalled Catherine's tenderness towards him. He commanded the Imperial Russian army, launching a major offensive against Turkey. After days and nights of madness and slaughter, Imperial Russia finally achieved final victory.</p>
<p>On this day, Orlov was in the camp, drinking and making merry with his soldiers. Everyone was beating war drums and singing songs of victory. Suddenly, a disheveled, ragged Gypsy girl wandered into the camp. She had bewitching giant eyes, a lovely figure, and crimson lips. In particular, her demeanor of unsettled panic was, in Orlov's eyes, even more unusually charming. Especially in the military camp, it was as if encountering a spring in the desert. From that moment on, a deep, lovely shadow was embedded in Orlov's heart. This Gypsy girl, she was fleeing the violence of those fully armored warriors, and then she rashly ran into Orlov's camp; at first, she was a little frightened, but when Orlov stared at her intently, she suddenly felt a sense of shame. After a while, she recovered her usual lively state and began to sing her charming song. Her dancing posture while singing, and her soft and moving tone, penetrated deeply into the depths of Orlov's heart, word by word! He was lost; he didn't know what to do with his heart.</p>
<p>It was dusk, and the sounds of the battlefield brought some desolate air. Orlov was contemplating how to deal with this enchanting girl, and in a blink of an eye, she had disappeared. He felt an indescribable emptiness.</p>
<p>About a week later, Count Shuffalov, who had lost favor at the court, was sent to the front line. He was walking around the camp on patrol when he accidentally encountered this alluring Gypsy girl. Her two eyes, with their enchanting magic, were just like those of Princess Posietty, who was living in seclusion in the monastery. Shuffalov observed carefully and felt that she not only had Princess Posietty's appearance but also Princess Posietty's spirit. He thought to himself, "Since Princess Posietty refuses to come out against Catherine, I can use this Gypsy girl as a tool to oppose Catherine." (To be continued)</p>
