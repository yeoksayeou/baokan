<h3 id="c12">中日互惠稅率問題　乃 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>中日互惠稅率問題。議論紛紜。頗多誤會。有認爲中日通商條約者。有認爲中日關稅協定者。實則中日通商行船條約。早經期滿宣吿廢止。而擬議改訂之中日通商航海條約。亦迄未締結。中日關稅協定。不過爲在通商航海條約未締結以前之一種過渡辦法。亦不能視爲通商條約。而所謂互惠稅率者。則僅爲關稅協定附件換文之一。更與關稅協定正文無關。該換文之内容。不過表示雙方政府。于三年期内。維持某種進口貨物之某種稅率。維持云者。原有暫時之意。而旣以三年爲期。則三年以後。當然失效。與他種條約載有續商續訂及期前通吿等條欵者。截然不同。此誠如全浙公會文電所云『無宣吿取銷之必要。更無修正之理由。』而因此主張宣吿關稅協定正文之失效。則尤爲漠不相關。未加審察也。</p>
<p>此項互惠稅率。名爲互惠實爲偏惠。論者言之詳矣。蓋我所惠於彼者。如本色市布。二十年進口數爲四百八十萬兩。麵粉爲一千二百六十萬兩。此外名目繁多。不及備載。而日人之所惠于我者。則合夏布綢緞繡貨三者。年出口額。不過數十萬兩而已。國人辦理外交。往往僅求表面上條欵相稱。而不權其内容之輕重。自欺欺人。誠可謂極敷衍妥洽之能事。然暗中斷送權利。則不可計數矣。</p>
<p>今者此種名爲互惠實爲偏惠之稅則。將於五月十六日滿期。各公團旣有積極之主張。原案意義。亦甚少續訂之可能。而宋子文氏在平對記者談話。亦謂决不續訂。則滿期廢止。殆已爲確定之政策。此項稅率廢止之結果。其影響又將如何乎。其一、則我國與各國所訂條約。大都含有最惠國條欵。故特惠於日本者。勢必同時均沾於其他有約國。對日本某種進口貨須課低稅者。即不啻對該項進口貨之全數須課低稅。此種低稅進口貨。自爲同種國内産品之大敵。故中日互惠稅率廢止之後。關稅增高。對於本國工業。自甚有利。其二、則各國之對華經濟侵略。除進口貨外。尙有在華之工業。如日人在華之紡織業。其生産力之偉大。至超過國人自營紡織業之上。日人年來在我國對於紡織業經營之猛進。蓋已明知互惠稅率滿期之後。甚少繼續之可能。故不能不爲未雨之綢繆。深思遠慮。咄咄逼人。是則我國工業家。其勿遽以得關稅之保護爲得計。須知外人在華之工業。固仍爲其堅强之敵手也。</p>

<p>春秋蕭伯訥遊華  百合　　在最近的現在，含有「滑稽」與「諷剌」二種成分，蘇州人所謂「形容勿出」的「幽默」，大有成爲中國的作者與讀者們的第一生命，因爲「將來若以十吋長之砲彈，代十六吋，屠殺人民，已屬大幸」之下的中國人民，死生早已置之度外了，在此「此顧生命，祗求幽默」的潮流中，世界第一流幽默文學家蕭伯訥老先生，居然抱着「温和的傲態」，光臨「渠以爲殊有興趣的中國政府」治下的中國。雖然蕭老先生「决不親自簽名，」幸喜他沒有認爲他的漫遊中國，同「飛游長城，以爲無味之事，莫甚於此，長城於中國有何用乎」，是同一意義，否則亞洲是永不會自就蕭老先生的，我儕愛好幽默的細民，怎會夢見這位幽默大師的丰采。　　我記得蕭老生遊了一次蘇俄，得了一個很好的印象。遊了一次印度，便主張英國應放棄統治印度的政策。這次來遊中國，我想總不至於帶些「辮子」，「小脚」的印象回去的。但不知對於英人之統治香港作何感想？蕭伯訥軼事　李建新　　蕭伯訥是世界現存的老文豪之一，因爲他賦性幽默，而且個性特强，他便有了不少的有趣的軼事，下面幾則是從英文雜誌中選譯出來的。　　　沒有幾久前，一個年靑的新聞記者被打發去會蕭伯訥，若是他的問語合乎理性，蕭氏答應回答他的問語，及至蕭氏看了問語後，他認爲那些問題合格，於是預備了一千字回復他。以後他要知道他能得到酬金多少，這很使那年靑年記者受驚，因爲他什麽都不能允許他。蕭氏對於這人厚顔白白地要去他的一千寳貴的字很是惱怒，於是他不樂地向他道，「他們給你多少薪金！」那記者道「五鎊一禮拜，」蕭氏答道，「只有五鎊一禮拜嗎？好笑！回去吿訴你的編輯說倘若他要這篇訪問記，他能將你的薪金加到七鎊。」於是那記者鼠竄而去，第二天，他回來了，他說他的編輯只允一禮拜加他一鎊，「這比不加總好，」不是嗎？蕭氏笑着說，於是將那文字交給了他。　　有一個年靑上的女伶問蕭伯訥對於伊的演劇能力的意見，及至伊預演完畢後，蕭氏笑着對伊說，「你得回去結婚，生兩個孩子，學習一些人生的經騐，然後你或者有演劇的能力，」伊照着他的話一樣樣地實行，過了五年伊重登舞台，伊便是瓊恩黛格，伊是被稱爲英國舞台最偉大的女伶。　　蕭伯訥有時很是仁慈慷概的，有一次，他所認識的一個新聞記者因病而失了業，弄得很困頓，蕭氏聽到了這個消息，他給他一個稀奇的訪問，他與他談着各種的辯論的問題，從政治到兩性，從食物到上帝，蕭氏沒有取到一文錢，但那位記者却藉此收入可支持他的一年的生活。盲人的悲哀  ·重·樓　　丨用蕭伯訥「夜色正茫茫黎明、尙有待」詩意丨　　十字街頭站立着一個盲人，他不絕地翻着他白色的變睛，他想别人都說這世界是多麽的繁榮，！　　他不懂怎樣是美醜甚麽是黑白，他祇能聽見步代和車輪的嗚聲，他祈禱他能脫離這茫茫的長夜！他祈禱他跨過這黯黯的途程！盲人的悲哀引起我心絃的共鳴，我希望有一天盲人能睜開他的眼睛，社會的醫療者消除一切的病態，全人類得享受那幸福的黎。蕭伯訥的名言  ·左·立　　常人不願過天才的生活，他們覺得僕役的生活尙較天才的生活好過些。　　美的東西初看都是好的。可是在家中放了三天之後，誰還再去瞧它？　　對於受你老拳而不還擊的人須要提防，他决不饒你。　　批評家只見他們所欲見的東西而不見他們目前的東西。　　能犧牲自己的也能犧牲他人。　　偉大是把微小誇大起來罷了。　　四十歲以上的人都是無賴。　　對人說厭倦人生，是最可笑的事；假若一個人眞的厭倦了人生，那末他可以即時開始絕食　　紳士太太們可與犬爲友而不可與廚子爲友。　　愛國是迷信本國在其他各國之上　　女子終身對男子說誑。　　經騐如能敎人的話，那末倫敦街上的石頭比古今所有的聖哲都聰明。　　問：你爲何拆我私信？答：因爲我們是知己，所以我有權拆閱你的信。　　「陶鎔」兒童的性格比爲人打胎罪孼更重。　　讀傳記的時候須要記着，眞正的事實是不能刋布的。　　家庭是少女的牢獄，婦人的工塲。　　眞正的慈善家不輕施與。　　上司對於下屬是毌須禮貌的。　　有理性的人以一己適合世界；無理性的人常欲以世界適合一己。所以世界的進步端賴無理性的人。文字的幽默和諷剌  妙神　　英國文學家蕭伯訥來上海了。蕭伯訥是一位戲劇家，同時也是一位善於作諷剌文字的幽默作家，我想起了蕭伯訥，更聯想起幽默諷剌文字的重要和偉大了。　　在一個惡勢力壓迫的嚴重環境之中，對於他自身所受的痛苦，旣不能率直的指摘，又不許善意的勸吿，使無盡的牢騷和煩惱悶在肚裏，不准透出半口氣來；這時若我們有幽默諷剌的談話的本領，則用旁敲側擊的態度，委婉地以幽默的言詞，諷剌着事實，即是所謂「駡人的藝術」!　　大概閱者中還有人記得，最近英國因無力付與美國在去年十二月十五日到期的一筆戰債，但美國拿出猶太人索債的態度，窮兇極惡地追索，於是氣惱了我們這位老頭兒蕭伯訥，他說；我們還是以愛爾蘭抵償給美國，作爲戰債吧。美國明知英國那肯剜去伊心頭肉的愛爾蘭，無非老頭兒和美國開頑笑吧了；但老頭兒的賴債方法又何等的幽默！　　還記得交一個人，曾在某報上作一文，作種種的豫測，他說將來我們的政府，要長期抵抗遷到帕米爾高原，這又是何等有力的諷剌啊！　　痛駡足以使人惱羞成怒，但諷剌却祗有使他慚愧。剛直每易令人忠言逆耳，但幽默却可使他深思。所以世界各國的報紙中，並不以時事寫眞畫爲重要，而時事的諷剌畫，却被記者們所珍視；文字亦以率直的缺少含蓄，而大家以幽默爲號召了。　　我國際此國難方殷，而民衆的麻木，官吏的安閒，在在可使我們想像到一個民族將亡的悲哀。我們固然希望。一方　有聲疾呼的文字，震聾發聵：而另一方也需要不少幽默和諷剌的文字，藉以爲打幾次蘇醒的强心針。所以我希望各種刋物能負着這個使命，以後多多刋載以文藝的格式，關於民生疾苦的幽默和諷剌的文字，凡足以陶醉靑年心身的作品，還以少刋爲是，我們在此風雨同舟的時候，應多方面的喚醒和拯救才是啊。人物小誌蕭伯訥夫婦  鵑雲　　自從十年前印度詩哲泰戈爾來華以後，使東方民衆醉心拜倒的世界名人，直到現在纔盼望着蕭伯訥氏來華的事實。　　「到中國去是否飛游長城？」訪員這樣問。　「余以爲無味之事，莫甚於此！長城於中國有何用乎？哈里亞城較有趣味也！」　　愛作諷剌論調的文豪，總脫不了幽默的態度。　　蕭伯訥已成了世界的聞人，一舉一動都被人採作了新聞的資料。　　蕭夫人你們也許很生疏。　　巧絡梯，ＣharlotteＳhaw這便是蕭夫人的名字，也許世人知道。　　很精緻灰白色燙捲了的頭髪，鼻樑裏夾着眼鏡，在伊的外觀看來，似乎比了伊的年齡小這們十歲光景。　　伊和蕭伯訥的脾氣完全不同，蕭伯訥吃素，伊却常常吃牛排。　　伊是在商業社會上一個最聰敏的婦人。也許蕭先生著過一本書「婦人社會，」ＩntelligentＷomansＧuideＴoＳocialism是拿伊來借題發揮的，　　伊喜歡讀文學書。伊說：「從文學書裏能够看出高深的思想。」伊不喜歡看小說，喜歡看名人的傳記。伊說：「一個婦人應當多懂得些各國的方言，」所以伊現在開始讀俄文了。　　蕭伯訥到俄國去的一次，蕭夫人仍守在家裏，伊却讓伊最知己朋友愛世特夫人ＬadyＡstor陪了去。　　伊自己不曾創立過什麽商業上的市塲，也不曾參加過什麽會議，或者伊站在宴席前致幾句答詞，因爲别人頌揚了伊的丈夫。　　蕭伯訥說：「伊是他生平最知己的愛友。他所以要娶伊來做夫人的原因。是因爲伊是一個投資家。」　　漫畫　蕭伯訥周游世界　　以前蕭伯訥一向都是由伊供養的。　　蕭伯訥十分孤苦，在當時幾幾乎生了病都沒有人理眯。　　那時伊還是一個中年的婦人，他却已經衰老的了。　　一個是有腦筋當於思想的英才，一個是有錢而懂得世情常識的女子。伊甘心收養着他，親自給他看護，供給他一切用途。　　在他們結婚五年之後，蕭伯訥一躍而爲世界十大名人之一。　　蕭夫人自己曾經誇耀着說：「我一手造就成了一個世界的英才！」　　但是雖然蕭先生常出門，常在世界上人衆前走，伊却總是守在家裏。　　新聞紙上大標題載「蕭伯訥夫婦」來華。還算是一個疑問，到底是不是Ｃharoltte蕭夫人　？</p>

<p>自由談	蕭伯訥專號（上）歡迎蕭伯納  烈文　　我不是英文學的專攻者。但是兩年前在巴黎跟着Ｂaldensperger敎授治比較文學時，在Ｌ'expression　satirique　dans　I'oeuvte　d'AnatoleＦrance這樣的一個論題下，曾將和佛郎士同時代的幾個富於諷剌氣分的文人的著作拿來比較過一下，蕭當然是其中的一個，用法文寫成的論文中的一章，是很可以翻譯出來在這專號裏面凑凑熱鬧的，却因爲死了女人，搬家，不知被用人檢在那一隻書箱的角落裏去了。　　在我現在的心情！「死」的念頭像神話裏面的Ｈydre一樣盤踞在心頭的情形之下。是無論如何也打不起精神來查書做文章的。現在只把幾年前蕭的著作在我的腦中所留不的模糊的印象說一說。　　我覺得蕭有兩宗事是値得我們稱許的：其一是把古往今來許多英雄好漢的錦袍輕輕剝下，從古羅馬的　撒以至近代的拿破侖，都給現出了平凡的人的原形。其二是對於資本主義制度下的一切文物的嘲駡，宗敎不用說，連科學也被笑謔。還有愛情，在蕭的眼中，似乎也祗是一種Ｍensonge，這個，我們在他的傑作Ｃandida一劇中便可看出。　　此外，却也並沒什麽，像蕭所痛烈攻擊的Ｃant,sham,Ｓnobisme等等，兩百年前，莫里哀在Ｔartuffe'ＭaladeＩmagumaire,ＰrecieusesＲidicules等劇中，早已用作題材了。雖然蕭似乎祗知道有一個沙士比亞而不知道有莫莫里哀。　　至於我們這次發刋蕭伯訥專號的原故，也可以就便在這裏說說：我們因爲㈠蕭是和我們一樣的搖筆桿子的朋友，並且好些地方我們還說得上是志同道合的；㈡蕭以七十多歲的高齡來遊中國，這是很難得的事，恐怕這是他第一次也是最後一次看見中國罷？所以我們趁這機會給我們的ＶieuxＣontrere留下一點痕跡，倒並不是怕像香港的中國新聞記者一樣挨駡，說是幼稚得連蕭都不認識。蕭伯納頌  何家幹　　蕭伯納未到中國之前，「大晚報」希望日本的軍事行動會因而暫行停止，呼之曰「和平老翁」。　　蕭伯納旣到香港之後，各報由路透電譯出他對靑年們的談話，題之曰「宣傳共産」。　　蕭伯納「語路透訪員曰，君甚不像華人，蕭並以中國報界中人全無一人訪之爲異，問曰，彼等其幼稚至於未識余乎？」（十一日路透電）　　我們是老練的，我們很知道香港總督的德政，上海工部局的章程，要人的誰和誰是親友，誰和誰是仇讐，誰的太太的生日是那一天。但對於蕭，惜哉，就是作品的譯本也僅只有三四種。　　所以我們不能認識他在歐洲大戰以前和以後的思想，也不能深識他游歷蘇聯以後的思想。但只就路透電所傳，在香港入學對學生說的「如汝在二十歳時不爲赤色革命家，則在五十歲時將成不可能之殭石，汝欲在二十歲時成一赤色革命家，則汝可在四十歲時不致落伍之機會」的話，就知道他的偉大。　　但我所謂偉大的，並不在他要令人成爲赤色革命家，因爲我們有「特别國情」，不必赤色，只要汝今天成爲革命家，明天汝就失了性命，無從到四十歲。我所謂偉大的，是他竟替我們二十歲的靑年，想到了四五十歲的時候，而且並不離開了現在。　　闊人們會搬財産進外國銀行，坐飛機離開中華民國，或者是想到明天的罷，「政如飄風，民如野鹿」，窮人們可簡直連明天也不能想了，况且也不准想，不敢想。　　又何况二十年，三十年之後呢？這問題極平常，然而是偉大的。　　此之所以爲蕭伯納！介紹蕭伯納  郁達夫　　蕭伯納的名字呌作ＧｅｏｒｇｅＢｅｒｎａｒｄＳｈａｗ簡作Ｇ·Ｂ·Ｓ·和司替文孫的Ｒ·Ｌ·Ｓ·三個頭字一樣的爲大家所知道。一千八百五十六年，生於南愛爾蘭之杜伯林（Ｄｕｂｌｉｎ）市，一八七六年隨母至倫敦。是一位很漂亮的雜文記者，不守舊例不循規矩的批評家。後爲費邊協會會員，成了非正統的社會主義者。先寫小說，最著名的爲「開舍爾。貝倫（ＣａｓｈｅｌＢｙｒｋｎ’ｓＰｒｏｌｅｓｓｉｏｎ）及「藝術家間之愛」與「非社會的社會主義者等。初受美國亨利·喬其和學說影響，後轉入於馬克斯主義。以戲劇爲他的宣傳武器，作成劇本至數十種之多。最著名的，有「武器與人「人及超人」「華倫夫人的職業」「聖爵安」等等。散文集之有名的，爲戲劇論集，伊孛生主義，樂聖華格臯等的宣述，以及爲有産階級男女說社會主義的著作等等。　　平生愛聽音樂，愛看戲劇，愛說死話。連對他自己的父親的批評，都喜歡以死話出之。他說：「我的父親是一個無能的，不成功的人，在主義上他是一位熱烈的禁酒主義者，但在實際上却是常在偷偷喝酒的醉漢。」又最愛和人抬槓子打叉，臂如當一位德國猶太人馬克斯·諾爾道（ＭａｘＮｓｒｄａｕ）在擺起新人的面孔，大說近代藝術的墮落的時候，他老就會一反素來的習慣，出來說最守舊的妙語。到了他占稀的誕辰，英國各報，當然都登他的照相，爭呈頌譽，他老人家却忿忿地說：「我早晨起來，一見了這許多報上的我自己的照相，倒以爲我是死了。」　　在英文裏有一個新字，呌作Ｓｈａｖｉａｎ後面加上一個ｉｓｍ或ｉｓｔ上去，就是屬於這的主義及主義者。字典上去翻翻，或有會翻不到，怕要譯作剃頭主義或整容主義者，但其實却是指蕭老的崇拜及模仿者而言，猶左拉之於Ｚｏｌａｉｓｍ也。關於蕭的評傳之類，英美出得很多，似以ＦｒａｎｋＨａｒｒｉｓ和ＡｒｃｈｉｂａｌｄＨｅｎｄｅｒｓｏｎ的兩本爲最好。　　我們對於蕭的希望，就想他能以幽默的口吻去向世界各國說出我們致府對於日本帝國主義來侵後的幽默，與國聯對於此事的幽默，另外倒也沒有什麽。歡迎蕭伯納來聽砲聲  鄭伯奇　　蕭伯納到中國來了。這世界的大諷剌家到中國來了。我們應該怎樣歡迎他呢？　　開一個歡迎的宴會罷？讀一篇冠冕堂皇的祝辭罷？再不然，呌盛妝的少女捧送給他一束美麗的鮮花罷？那自有「高等華人」去辦，用不着我們再白費心。　　我們應該用民衆的熱情和威力去歡迎他。讓他感受到在蘇聯或者在印度所感受過的一樣。在蘇聯，他感受到五年計劃的偉大；在印度，他感受到獨立運動的狂熱；在我們這國度裏，他將感受到些什麽？　　我們不能用奪回漢口九江英租界的那時代的那種熱情來歡迎他，眞是一件遺憾的事！不然，他也許可以像對印度獨立運動一樣，很爽快地給我們預約一個可喜的前途。　　「長期抵抗」的呼聲，「民族主義文學」的運動，怕不見得會合他的脾胃罷。　　那麽，我們應該用什麽去歡迎這個和平的社會主義者呢？　　我想，還是很本色地拿出我們的本地風光來罷。爲遠方來的珍客，這應該是很奇妙的東西。　　瞧，我們這兒有的是流血，恐怖，飢餓，失業，戰禍，水旱災，而最新鮮最重要的，還有日本的入規模的侵略。這是世界大戰的導火線，這是世界革命的前奏曲。　　這已經够了。伴着這前奏曲，現在全國都燃起了烽火，遍地都鳴動了砲聲，這是一幅偉大的時代畫圖，値得獻給這理想家的。　　東北抗日的民衆義軍，華北抗日的士兵和民衆，全國反帝的先鋒。在熱河，在吉林，在南滿沿線，在長江上游，和在中部地方，砲聲都在不斷地震響。這决不是偶然的現象，也是西歐所沒有的現象，因之也就不是蕭伯納所容易看到的現象。　　假使，他用他的銳利的頭腦，把這些砲聲分析得清清楚楚，和分析他的戲曲中人物的關係一樣，他也許可以給世界的民衆作一個很好的報吿。　　這裏又是一個試金石，爲這個老社會主義者。　　好！就歡迎蕭伯納來聽砲聲罷。黑女求神記  蕭伯訥作宜閑譯　　「那麽，敎你的父親來，讓他來殺你，」萬軍的主說。「你的親歳們得帶許多公羊，山羊綿羊來給我，在我的前面當作祭品烤了孝敬我，要不然，我一定要用頂可怕的瘟疫來除滅他們，這纔他們可以知道我是神。」　　「我不是小囡，也不是長成的呆子，會相信這種荒唐的廢話，」黑女孩子說：「爲了我所尋求的眞的神，我要斬死你，同你斬死那條可憐的「猛白」一樣，」於是她揮着「諾勃凱黎，」跳上岩石堆，向他撲過去。　　然而當她到了那　端的時候，那邊却什麽也沒有。這使她非常迷惑了，她便坐下來，拿出　　了她那本當作指導的聖書，然而，不知道是螞蟻爬到了那書上呢，邇是因爲是很舊的書的緣故，總之，那書給自然的朽腐弄到毁滅了，所有初代的張資已經碎爛而成了廢末，這當她翻開的時候，被風吹散了。　　於是她歎了一口氣，站起身來，重復進行着她的尋求。不一會，她擾動了一條響尾蛇，那條蛇正在流動開去的時候，她說道，「哦！克哩嘰，克哩嘰；你沒有「猛白」那麽壞脾氣。你是給人家警吿的，如果我們顧自安安靜靜地走着，你也就顧自安安靜靜地走着。你的神一定比「猛白」的神來得好。」　　於是那響尾蛇回轉來，指點她跟在他後面，她便這麽辦。　　他引導她到清幽的林間空地，在那裏，一個生着柔軟的銀白的鬚髪，也穿着白睡衣的微老的紳士坐在一張　着白布的桌子旁邊，那桌子上攤有詩的原稿和幾枝天使的羽毛做成的筆。他顯得十分和善；然而他那蹺起的髭鬚和眉毛却表現了那黑衣孩子以爲愚蠢的一種自滿的狡獪。　　「克哩嘰克哩嘰，好小子，」他對那蛇說。「你帶了一個人來同我辯論了。」於是他給了那蛇一個蛋，牠喜洋洋地將這個蛋帶進森林裏去。　　「不要怕我，」他對黑女孩子說。「我不是兇惡的神：我是明理的神。我不幹辯論以外的什麽壞事。我在辯論上是個能手。不要崇拜我。責備我罷。尋出我的錯誤來罷。不要顧到我的感情。丢些什麽在我的牙齒中間罷，我可以就此辯論了。」　　「這世界是你造的麽？」黑女孩子說，　　「當然是我造的，」他說。　　「爲什麽你造内中有着這許多惡的世界的？」她說。談蕭伯納  林語堂　　蕭伯訥傳記　　最近有兩本蕭伯納的傳記出板，一本是亨德生（ＡｒｃｈｉｂａｌｄＨｅｎｄｅｒｓｅｎ）所作。亨德生是蕭伯納所稱爲十九世紀後沒人知道的美國北加羅來那省大學的一位敎授；該大學幸虧有一位研究蕭伯納的亨德生，也許藉此可揚名於後世。亨德生是蕭氏的老友，這本書是特得蕭的許可而作的，是唯一Ａｕｔｈｏｒｉｚｅｄ的蕭傳。全書八百餘頁，蕭之一生著作，思想，行述，家世，及關於他的笑談軼事都搜羅收入了。但是我到底喜歡赫理斯（ＦｒａｎｋＨａｒｒｉｓ）所作的傳，而不喜歡亨傳。理由很簡單。赫理斯是個文人，天才作家，而亨德生却是規規矩矩的編撰人而已。所以赫理斯的文，讀來津津有味，有骨氣，有風味，有諧謔，有深思，有警語，有觀感，而亨傳却只會作發皆中節的爛調，說不偏不倚的公道話而已；比之通常評傳固無愧，比之赫傳就多遜色了。而且赫傳篇幅只亨傳的一半，讀來反而　得極親切逼眞的蕭伯納印象。　赫傳勝於亨傳還有一層理由，就是兩位作傳的人對書中主人翁態度之不同。亨德生雖然也保持「學者面具」，主持公道，批評蕭伯納，但是到底他是蕭伯納的崇拜者；蕭伯納在赫傳的跋中稱亨傳爲巨著”Ｍｏｎｕｍｅｎｔａｌ　ｂｉｏｇｒａｐｈｙ“，尤其使我們懷疑。因爲學者雖然也是忠實，到底不大肯說由衷之言。赫理斯只是文學界的叛徒，他雖不標榜公道，寫出來的却字字是心聲。他不是蕭的崇拜者，他是蕭的畏友，要挖苦就挖苦，要嘲弄就嘲弄，所以他畫來的一副神像，反而逼肖。我主張凡讀書人，　研究任何學術上的題目，必先從反對批評的書看起，再看正央的書丨丨研究蔣介石的人，應先看看改組派前幾年的文章，再看一年來改組派的文章。如此思想才不會冬烘。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言民氣  厚英　　溯自「九一八」以來，我們國中又已經不知道出過了多少被人侮辱事情了，在每件事情發生之初，大家固然是興高采烈的貼標語，出外演講，甚而致於淌眼沫淚，但是有幾個月過去了，侮辱的事情即或是尙在進行，或者是無形延宕，而我們的民氣却要漸漸的消滅了，丨固然這不是完全整個的團體懈怠下來，但是我敢說至少有一大半是如此的，這樣的民氣，正好比在夏日炎炎滾熱的地上，潑了一盆冷水；先前倒也像煞有介事的其勢淘洶，但是不到半刻鐘的功夫，這一滿盆的冷水的成分，就都被高張的火傘吸做水蒸汽，無形地歸入牠的範圍内上天去了。　　其實，能夠在事情發生的時候淌眼沫淚，奔走呼號的，已經是好的了，其餘的老百姓還依舊在那裏睡他們的昏昏大覺；而有冷血的奸商，更是變本加厲地販買仇貨。這實在是一樁太可痛而又太可恨的事情了！　　古人曰「哀莫大於心死」。我們中國的人雖不死，心却早已死了，還有什麽方法可以想呢？外國人一次一次的來替我們打嗎啡針，但是只能提醒一部份少數的智識階級中的人；而且興奮了幾個月，又要漸漸的死過去，這種情形，在我們貴中國，已經是數見不鮮了。　　總而言之，據我國過去的事實講起來，是沒有一件夠得上有民氣的，直到最近的一年以來，方才那東北義勇軍替我們這個老大民國掙了一口氣；他們「浴血苦戰」，「誓死抗敵」，甚而至於有情願凍死，不甘屈服的。這種精神，在外國也不能多見，眞是我們所値得欽服的偉大人物。　　所以，我希望住在内地和都市裏的同胞，尤其是上海，大家都能提起了精神來救國；儘自己一個人的力量，購用國貨，以及給予東北義勇軍物質上的供給。這樣，雖然不能把頑敵一時三刻地趕出三島，但是呌别國的人民看見了，也可以知道我們中華民國的人民，已經不是像從前一般的昏庸了，文藝贈徐烈士  孫籌成　　柘湖徐仲書，高州一役，任奮勇隊隊長，振臂殺敵，飲彈陣亡，年僅三十有三，忠骸未返，埋骨沙塲，爲表揚起見，擬築衣冠墓以慰英魂，眇翁曾賦七　　絕四首，藉報故友。　　英雄自古負豪名，腰下龍泉吼不平，祖逖先鞭由我着，聞鷄起舞繞床行。　　昻藏七尺豈虚生，大好男兒志不更，革命未成須努力，斗牛奇氣自縱橫。　　丈夫效命在疆塲，建節旗常姓氏揚，一戰捐軀圖報國，梓桑頂祝永馨香。　　衣冠立墓表豐隆，不朽勳名重報功，碑傳千秋深仰望，松楸佳樹蔭葱蘢。記夢  賓符　　每天照例爲着生活去做工，每天照例爲着生活煩悶着，這肉體上的疲倦，精神上的煩悶，無不是由於「喫飯」而起，在現在這樣的世界中，喫飯眞是件不容易的事，要想不喫，事實却不由你不喫，要想喫，却又不容易給你喫。現實的生活眞夠苦悶了，我每每望逃避現實，便同時我應當謝謝造化，幸而牠給我們造了「夜」，幸而有「夜」給我安息，給我做幻想的夢，記得有人說過，「夢是我們唯一的神聖權利啊」！昨夜我又做了一個夢。把牠記了下來：　　	我忽然走到了一個不知什麽國家的街道中，街道的兩旁米店林立，米店門口都有巡捕模樣的人站着崗，據說這些米店都是他們的政府開的，所以有警察看門，據一個人吿訴我，這國家有一條法律，就是白米祗能官賣，絕對不準商賣。這樣就沒有市儈操縱市價，貽害平民的生計了。我不禁吐了口氣，因爲這于我的「喫飯」不免有些便利的。那人又吿訴我，這個國家還有一條法律，規定人民不得煑飯喫，換句話說，就是禁止人民把米變做飯，這却嚇壞了我，我幾乎要馬上逃走，因爲我是只會喫飯的，如果把生米塞到肚子裏，可不要把我活活的塞死嗎？然而這人又對我說，如果你要喫飯，也是可以的，只要向政府納相當的罰金就得了，據說這是他們國王的苦心，因爲該國全國的人口太多了，所以呌人民都去喫生米，可以「塞」死一些人。而同時罰欵喫飯，于國王收入方面，也不無小補啊。這就是寓禁於「金」的人口經濟政策。　　醒來以後，混身是汗，宇宙間原來還有這樣的一個世界，我以後也不要再做夢了。現實反映的夢，于我也只有厭惡，我願飛去！　二二，二，一三。店員通訊一位女店員的家庭悲劇編者先生：　　我是一個十八歲的弱女子；家父年已七十有二，他生平娶過四位妻子。第一個是元配，現在已經去世，並無所出。第二個是繼室，生有兩子。第三個就是我的生母，也就是人世間惟一愛我的人：她是被社會上一般人所瞧不起的「偏房」。因爲這一層緣故，我自出娘胎，就處處吃虧：不料福無雙至，禍不單行，在我九歲的時候，她竟一命嗚呼了。接着我的父親，又討上一個「偏房」。當時她的年紀，才十七歲，不過手段却狠辣。她因爲地位關係，家裏人的人，除了我一個之外，都不敢欺侮；不幸的我，就成爲她雌威的對象了。她不時在家父面前，簸弄是非；我的父親又爲了寵愛她的緣故，奉命惟謹。每一個月裏，終不免要挨十幾回毒打。後來她居然養了小孩，於是名正言順的不許我讀書，終日替他在家裏領囝；所以我小學竟不曾畢業。現在我年紀大了，她知道這「打」的玩意兒，不能再繼續進行，所以換了手段，敎唆我父親，斷絕我的經濟。唉！在名式上，我是有一個父親，兩個母親，但是在實際上，我却不忍說了　　　我的父親是很富有的，他現在開着三爿店舖；但我却並不希望他的遺産。我現在是一爿小商店裏的職員，前途全沒有希望。我想我惟有憑我自己的努力，尋我前途的光明。但是究竟怎樣着手呢？編者先生，請你細細地指引我，謝謝你，祝你康健　　　吳淑英謹上　　×　×　×　×　×　　編者按：讀了吳女士的來信，使我們不得不揮一掬同情之淚她雖則是一種「差誤」制度（納妾）下的産物；但她！她個人丨對於這「差誤」，不負任何責任，她不應該受這種人世間的痛苦呀！　　吳女士的父親，在元配亡故之後，一則尙在中年，一則膝下猶虚，再娶上一個繼室，當然是對的。但是在中年以後，而且業已有了兩個兒子之後，還娶上一位偏房，那就差誤了。除了因爲有幾個臭銅鈿，「飽煖思淫慾」之外，簡直毫無理由。吳女士是這種心理之下的欵物，他老人家不放在眼裏，當然是在意計之中，最不該的，就是在他第一個姨太太去世之後，算來年已六十有四，還仗着有財有勢，娶上一位十七歲的少女，做如夫人。我們知道老夫少妻環境之下，妻的方央，如何煩悶呀；「殺雞打鴨」，勢所難免。吳女士以前所受的痛苦，雖說是她簸弄出來，但禍根還是這老人家種的呀！　　吳女人對於父親的資財，並不眼紅，當然自是她的大度。但我們以爲對付這種「銅臭薰天」，動不動以經濟壓人的臭東西，却非使他一破慳囊不可。應當聯合母系親戚，調查他老人家的資財，提出虐待的證據，要求劃出財産的一部，作爲求學，娘嫁時費用的保障。一面繼續去讀書，慢慢兒放出眼光，嫁一個可意的丈夫。那末後半世的幸福，就足可補償你前半包的辛酸了。再不然向母系親戚或知己朋友處，借了錢去讀書，也未始不可。好在這律債，自有你應得的一部份遺産作抵呢。　　因爲「納妾」制度，在中國社會裏，這樣的普徧；所以這種家庭悲劇，也就到處可以看到。根本解救的辦法，所以祗有剷除這種惡制度：一方面固有待於男性道德的培養，與法律的禁止。但另一方面却必須女子自身的覺醒：提高個人的智識技能，使有獨立謀生的本領婦女解放運動，須得婦女自己的努力，才能成功。否則不免要像解放後的黑奴，反不能像在地主庇護時候的衣食無憂呢。小說詩禮人家（二二續）  汪仲賢　　那個媒婆一心要替黛秋小姐做媒，過了兩三天，已被她找到了一份人家。這家姓趙，主人名呌趙爾康，乃是一個土財主。獨生一子，取名家棟，剛從學堂裏畢業出來。這位少爺，是趙家三房合一子，長得一表人才，自幼聰明，父母異常鍾愛，早想與他成婚，只因他家並無功名，又是信耶穌敎的，上等人家閨女都不願與他家配親，下等人家他們又不願娶，所以遷延至今。那媒婆就利用他家信敎，不會去請敎瞎先生算命，就將夏小姐說上去。趙家愛攀高親，知道夏家是本城數一數二的詩禮人家。與有財有勢的人家結了親能佔許多光，便十分贊成。媒婆到夏家去，當然也有一番贊美趙家的話頭。經她兩面拉攏，事情就有七八分眉目。　　若華爲女兒擇配，也很鄭重，媒婆去後，打發老胡出去仔細調查，果然姓趙的確是人家殷實。女婿看了照片不算，還親眼去相了幾回，才把親事答應下來。這頭親事，辦得很圓滿，祇有女婿信敎的一點，不很稱心，但因女兒命硬的關係，也祇得遷就一下了。　　行聘的日期擇定了，若華因無男主人主持婚事，寫了一封快信去把幼中催回來。幼中接到信，立刻趕回家來，離訂婚的正日祇有一天了，若華已把盤裏禮物預備妥貼，單等明天行盤，若華把定婚的經過吿訴了一遍，幼中也稱贊她的手段敏捷，笑着說道：　　『你是很能幹的人，喜事都辦妥了，何必還要急巴巴的催我回來呢？』　　若華道：『明天請酒，家裏沒有男主人招待，像個什麽樣子？你的兩個哥哥，都像活死人一樣，上次辦喪事，請他們來吃喝了幾天，一點主意也沒有。我看他們祇能在請帖上擺一個空名字的樣兒，肩膀上稻草的斤量都担不起一根，怎麽能靠托他們呢？』　　『明天請的是些什麽客人？』　　『沒有外人。除了幾個至親以外，祇有兩家的媒人，和我們的新親女婿。』　　『定親的日子請新女婿來幹什麽？向來沒有這規矩。』　　『這日男家要求的。他們要在結婚以前，先讓小夫妻交起朋友來，免得將來過了門，夫妻之間毫無感情。明天女婿上了門，以後就能常常來往了。』　　『這成了毛脚女婿了！我們是大墻門人家，豈能做出這種不名譽的事來！你怎麽答他的？』　　『現在是新派，未婚夫妻先交起朋友來，也是常有的事情。這又有什麽大驚小怪呢？』　　幼中見事已至此，也就不言語了。他回家去了一趟，就來帮着嫂子忙亂明天的事。他得了空，溜到黛秋房裏，把北京帶來的一包貴重禮物放在她面前她不言不語，祇是痴痴的望着那包東西。幼中低聲問道：</p>

<p>電影專刊擺侖摩亞一族之身世  羅琇　　丨約翰擺侖摩亞之自述丨　　　從事戲劇者頗不乏僥倖成名的，我們擺侖摩亞的一族，卻可以說是世代混在戲劇界中的。我的高祖父母湯麥斯萊恩（ＴｈｏｍａｓＦ·Ｌａｎｅ）和伊麗屈倫諾（ＥｌｉｚａＴｒｅｎｔｎｏｒ），早年即負盛名於英國戲劇界。我的外祖母魯賽，嫁給約翰特利（ＪｏｈｎＤｒｅｗ）的，是非勒特爾菲亞城愛克街戲院的經理，曾演過不少的戲劇，在六十歲的時候，她尙很高興地在「華倫寡婦」一劇中客串歌舞。　　我的父親茂萊是以ＡｓｙｏｕＨｉｋｅｉｔ·一劇出名的，我的姑丈特利第二也是一位有名的喜劇家，他的妻子蓓克是一個女演員，而它們的女孩魯意絲也頗醉心於戲劇。我的妻子陶樂賽康娣羅（ＤｓｈｏｒｅｓＣｏｓｔｅｌｌｏ），又是一位戲劇家茂萊康娣羅的女兒。　　我所處的環境如此，所以我雖屢次極力地想從别方面發展，竟是幾次三番的失敗　　我上了舞臺，已演過不少戲劇，也曾一度主演高爾斯華綏的名劇Ｊｕｓｔｉｅｃ，可是沒有獲到相當的成功，　　在銀幕上，我亦已主演過很多的片子，從「化身博士」（我的第一無聲片）到最近的「棄夫」（ＡＢｉｌｌｏｆＤｉｖｏｒｃｅｍｅｎｔ），已不下二十餘張　　像别的擺侖摩亞一樣，利昻的命運中早已註定他該從事戲劇。他幼時也曾在巴黎研習過戲劇藝術，油畫，和音樂。本來他可以從這三方面去發展，但是終亦不免成爲百老匯的一個演員。　　他在主演ＡＦｒｅｏＳｏｕｌ一片後，即不欲演片，願仍度其導演工作。可是有一天擺耶維勒拿了「爲女犧牲」（ＧｕｉｈｔｙＨａｎｄｓ）的劇本給他看時，他的心又躍躍欲試，而又主演了該片。此後又演了「亞森羅頻」，和「大飯店」。後列的兩片，均係我們所合演的。而最近好萊塢的人更從俑看我們和意絲爾，三個擺侖摩亞合演着「拉斯波丁」（Ｒａｓｓｓｏｕｔｉｎ）　　意絲爾在該片中扮的是菲杜羅伐娜（Ｆｅｄｏｒｏｖｎａ）貴婦，利昻即飾「拉斯波丁」，而我自己則擔任着一個「拉斯波丁」的剌客猶蘇潑夫太子（ＰｒｉｎｃｅＹｕｓｓｕｐｏｆｆ）。至於俄皇一角，則由族外人萊甫馬根（ＲａｌｐｈＭｏｒｇａｎ）所扮演了。影片談評評離婚笑史（ＡｌｍｏｓｔＡＤｉｖｏｒｃｅ）  凌鶴　　雖然是連卓别麟都得崇拜的雪泥霍特，但是並不能敎我們在走出戲塲之後，腦海裏有多少回味。本來，人生常有許多出於意料之外的喜劇發生，這種喜劇假如給藝術家把握住了而描寫出來，自能給人們以深刻的啓示，當然不僅是笑笑而已。但是，雪泥霍特在一影片中所吿訴我們的，雖然不是像一般的滑稽劇那般胡鬧，可是在意識上尙覺得缺少剌激。</p>
<p>本片中述一醉漢因其嗜酒而致其友人離婚，其後復因其醉而促進離婚者言歸於好。當然其中有不少的穿挿，有些意識錯亂作用的動作，也很有趣，譬如自己以爲自己的脚不在脚上，這使我在輕微笑了一陣之後而覺得世界上常會有這種人無意識的存在。　　至於導演在本片中的編輯法，也有可取之處，如在前面演了相當長久之後，才使主角和觀衆見面，這可以提高觀衆迫切的情緒，而使他們對於主角特别注意。　　可是因爲配角的欠健全，因爲結構的不能緊張，於是主角雖然着着沉重，仍是不見如何精采。然而配角如ＮｅｌｓｏｎＫｅｙｓ，却也不是如何壞的，他將一個忠於愛情的好丈夫在離異之後所覺受的人生的悲哀，確能簡單的表顯出來。這使曾經失戀的人們，會感受相當的剌激吧。　　本片的佈景很是堂皇，不過在這樣的一個劇本中，却也用不着如此耗費。　　「野孩子」王人美、她是明月社的台柱、不將在北京大戲院登台表演、滬江攝現代贈燈光有些塲合不甚明晰。收音還可以。外景有一個很好的鏡頭，在一條深邃的汽車道上，汽車的馳過，再聽着鳥雀的啼聲，也許這便是本片中最精采之處。　　其他無甚可取。雖然其中有許多對話很能使人發笑，但是在不諳英語的人們聽來，也是索然無味的。　　友人說：「這是英國片中最幼稚的」，雖然各人的觀點不同，但是我想誰也不能承認這也算是上乘作品吧。然而據廣吿上說：這是「諷剌哲理名片」。再評離婚笑史  明　　雪泥霍特ＳｉｄｎｅｙＨｏｗａｒｄ的稱爲滑稽明星，眞正是老牌子。的確的，卓别靈也說過崇拜他，呌他一聲老前輩。然而可惜極了，他跟不上潮流的巨輪，他永久保守着不前進。新近映的「到城裏去」和「胡鬧市長」雖然受到了一部份歡迎·便是不能恢復往日聲譽。　　這一次卡爾登換映的「離婚笑史」仍是和上兩張差不多，也許　是代表着英國人普遍的守舊性吧。　　進片子仍是英國屬地出品。一張由小節目和小動作，結合成的滑稽片。意識上不過是譏諷多疑善姤的女人而已。導演根本不重要，不過手腕上很有一些巧妙的地方。他很努力的詆毁着酒的破壞力。　　佈景和光線都是舊式方法。我們不一定說她是幼稚，或者他們特爲如此以給觀衆一點新回味。　　在演員中雪尼的表演眞是别開生面。那冷雋的言語，幽默的態度，雖然和已往的他一樣，然而處處包含了有趣的笑料，並不俗得討厭。尼爾生眞是死人般的懦夫，表演恰到好處。他們兩個人，一搭一擋，呌人前仰後合。他們不以熱鬧迅速，而以遲鈍沉靜取勝，眞是很可誇的地方。　　其餘女演員瑪格瑞和漢夢德很平常的配角而已。　　這一張片子本事並不可笑，技藝也　　很普通。牠之所以詼諧滑稽，而不失去一看的價値，完全是因爲在細小舉動上，總有微妙的優點存在。所以看這片子最好是一秒鐘也不忽略。　　對白是很多，然而出奇的淺近和簡單，所以極容易聽懂。不過有幾本發音不大好，恐怕是放映機上的。　　我認爲這一張片子比勞瑞哈代的「硬吵」有興趣些。聯華公司大製作丨南京映  神　　聯華公司是現在人才最多製作最努力一家了，繼「人道」以後的巨片有兩張，一個是本刋已介紹的「城市之夜」另一張是攝了許久尙未完竣的「燬滅」。　　「燬滅」是但杜宇的精心傑作，他要使第四廠（前上海公司）恢復往日光榮，所以出奇制勝的幹一下，劇本是帶幽默的諷剌畸形社會。他改換了已往專用殷明珠的獨脚戲而找了十多個明星合演。其中有薛玲仙，韓蘭根，唐雲倩，羅克明，葉娟娟等許多人。全片注重表情，想完全廢除字幕，而使觀衆充份了解　　　更有一點，是尤新奇的，牠每一幕無論多少繁重，多麽長久，都用一個鏡頭連續攝下。這當然是不只攝影機的進退轉移就能辦到的事，而每一個演員，都不能有絲毫的疏忽，當然導演列是費力。這是空前第一遭，舶來片中也沒有的。　　但杜宇自己也說過：我一生的成敗完全在這一張影片上了。　　我預祝他成功，丨丨他的成功，可以給片伸一伸氣。「猺山艷史」攝竣  蔣靑　　近兩三年來，一般人對於那種蠻荒獵狩之類的影片，多感到很大的興趣。像什麽「龍虎鬭」「菲洲小人」等，號召力非常的大，可惜國産片還沒有這種遠征冒險攝取的舉動。現在好消息來了，由黃漪磋領導的藝聯公司，這次去到廣西猺山中蠻漢素罕漢人踪跡的地方，攝取這套「猺山艷史」，一切異土風俗人情和種種不易見到的珍聞，都可由開麥拉介紹給我們。並可欣喜的是「猺山艷史」已有了攝竣的消息，那麽，恐怕不久便電影小說寬街獵艷記ＷａｌｋｉｎｇＤｏｗｎＢｒｏａｄｗａｙ（二）  毓靑　　「啊，家裏祗有些葡萄干，亦沒有吃的，亦沒有喝的」馬克喊著。　　「馬克，你這算什麽？」詹梅申斥他，「我出去買些東西來吃好不好？」　　於是他們你要吃什麽，我要喝什麽紛拏著。惟有潘琪不作聲。詹梅問了好幾聲，潘琪總說不吃什麽。詹梅說好歹弄些給她吃，她說買了亦是白費的，但是詹梅也不和她多說，就出去買東西去了。　　詹梅走了，潘琪趕快推開了馬克，站了起來。　　「做什麽，小姑娘，這算什麽？過來，我們親個嘴，要好要好。」　　馬克說完了，立時將潘琪拉了過來，抱住了，在她的櫻唇上吻了一下。潘琪怒極了，等到將馬克推開了，就順手一個巴掌，打在馬克的嘴巴上。她嘴裏還喊著；　　「你做什麽？你這個渾蛋，你跑到這裏來做什麽？我們是好女孩子。」　　「好女孩子？呸！」馬克一隻手掩住了被打的嘴巴，一隻手拿了帽子，想往外走。　　這個時候，門開了，一個女子跑了進來。她穿的黑衣服，態度很輕佻動人。他看見房裏有人就說道；　　「對不起得很，我不知道這裏有聚會。」　　她回過頭來，瞟了馬克一眼微微地一笑。「哦！我還是自己介紹自己吧。我是拉露小姐，我的名字呌孟娜。」　　馬克上下仔細地看了一下，喊道「喂，我認識你。你不是照過一張工人打扮的像片，登在星期畫報裏的嗎？你一定是。你想想，眞奇極了。你的像片，我至今還貼在牆上。不料今天會碰著你，眞奇極了。」　　「眞的嗎？你房裏的我的像片嗎？你種像片，我拍過許多，各種廣吿上用的亦很多，狐臭粉，平底脚治療法，黑　鷄眼膏藥！哦，多得很。想不到這一個小小的廣吿，有這樣大的號召力。」　　詹梅上樓梯的脚步聲聽見了，馬克高興得什麽似的趕緊去開門。，門一開就問詹梅；　　「喂，你認認這位，是誰？」　　「哦，我曉得，我曉得，讓我想一想。她！就是你從星期畫報裏剪下來的那位。」　　「喂，孟娜，你瞧，我總不哄你吧。」　　「眞巧極了，」孟娜說。　　這時密麗同潘琪都呆了，看了孟娜的交際工夫，著實不差，暗暗地在那裏心領神會。　　「我今天請客，」馬克說，「你也加入吧。孟娜好不好？」　　「好極了，但是，爲什麽不拿這許多東西上我房裏吃去。我有白磁碟子，還有些酒，還有無線電。」　　「好，」馬克說，「我們就去。」他說完了推了詹梅就走。詹梅一手的東西，還沒有來得及放下，被馬克推了就走，弄得他莫名其妙。密麗和潘琪留在房裏，他們亦沒有請她們一同去。潘琪等他們走了，就拿門關上了。　　「謝天謝地，他們都滾出去了。」（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde reports that the Japanese Kwantung Army intelligence team in Beipiao has recently recruited over a hundred workers to repair the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Railway. Furthermore, several Chinese traitors have been bought off by the Japanese military, and are firing guns at night. Tang Yulin has dispatched Councilor Shao Cifeng to Beipiao to negotiate with the Japanese side. Three hundred soldiers of the Japanese 8th Division, along with the 49th Artillery Regiment, have been discovered at Yaowang Temple in the first district of Lingnan, and will provide cover for infantry advancing towards Lingnan.

<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Rehe dated the 11th reports that 400 enemy cavalry, along with over a thousand Mongolian bandits, six armored vehicles, and thirty large carts laden with infantry, launched a fierce attack on Qiungpengzi Street and Xiaojieji, which are defended by Liu Zhendong's troops. Due to unfavorable terrain, they retreated to the west bank of the Hala Shaoguo Qing River. After Cui Xingwu and Li Haiqing assisted with reinforcements, Army Commander Feng Shengwu launched a frontal assault, while Liu Jingyu attacked from the northwest, with five battalions as a reserve force. After several hours of battle, the enemy retreated eastward. On the 12th, our forces occupied the Wafang area, resisted stubbornly, and launched a surprise three-sided assault. The enemy's ranks were thrown into chaos and they retreated in disarray, abandoning the Wang Laohui bunker. One enemy battalion commander and over ten soldiers were killed, and twenty puppet soldiers were captured, with thirty wounded. Numerous spoils of war, supplies, and medical materials were obtained. Our army suffered the loss of one officer and four soldiers killed, nine officers and fourteen soldiers wounded, and sixteen horses killed in battle. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military is mobilizing large numbers of troops to attack Rehe. Supply depots have been established in Dahushan, Jinzhou, and Xingcheng. The puppet Fengshan Railway and Jinzhou-Chaoyang lines are extremely busy with troop movements. It is rumored that the Japanese are preparing a general offensive on Rehe. Residents along the Liaoning-Rehe border are fleeing to various stations along the puppet Fengshan Railway in an attempt to escape by train. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Linyu, 8:00 PM on the 15th, reports that Japanese troops are transporting troops back and forth along the Jinzhou-Chaoyang lines, with uncertain movements. Five or six hundred cavalry troops have recently been added to the Tongliao area, all belonging to the 8th Division. The Paozi Station on the Datong line, which was once destroyed by righteous troops, has been repaired by the Japanese military. Over a hundred railway workers on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line were escorted by Japanese troops to the west of Zhoujiatun to build a military road in order to control Beipiao. The majority of the Japanese forces in Jin County, apart from those opening to the north or west, currently consist of over seven hundred infantry, three hundred cavalry, twelve aircraft, over two hundred vehicles, fifteen armored vehicles, and two armored trains from the 8th Division. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde, dated the 15th, reports that the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army has moved to Dahushan, and a portion of the 8th Division is advancing towards Lingnan. On the 14th, two enemy aircraft were sighted over Fuxin, dropping bombs. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde, dated the 15th, reports that the enemy is transporting military supplies and distributing leaflets in the Lianshan-Xingsui area, causing residents to flee.

<p>(Beiping) In 1931, when Japanese forces attacked the Nenjiang Bridge, the League of Nations was in session. Now, the League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to hold a meeting next Tuesday, and it is feared that the Japanese attack on Rehe will also begin at that time. Chinese authorities anticipate an imminent Japanese offensive, while well-informed Japanese sources openly claim that the Japanese military authorities wish to capture the Rehe provincial capital on the anniversary of the founding of "Manchukuo," which is March 1st. To achieve this goal, they must begin their offensive on February 21st. It is said that the Japanese forces in Jinzhou have been emptied, with only a thousand troops remaining for defense. The 8th Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Nishi, is now fully deployed along the Rehe border. According to reliable Japanese sources, the 6th Division, currently assembled in Tongliao, will also participate in the Rehe campaign. According to the Japanese military authorities, two divisions are sufficient to capture Rehe, as at least 70 percent of the task of subduing the province will be handled by the hundred aircraft currently assembled along the Rehe border. It now appears certain that when the offensive on Rehe breaks out, the Japanese forces at Yuguan will not be active, as the garrison forces at Yuguan are small and are currently focused on strengthening their defenses. Their situation suggests they do not wish to directly approach Tianjin. However, according to well-informed Japanese sources, the Beiping-Tianjin area may not be able to avoid "unrest" as a result. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military has requisitioned three thousand sets of carts and horses, concentrated in Suizhong, preparing to transport military supplies to the Suixi area for the attack on Rehe. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a military officer stationed in Chaoyang, at 4:00 PM on the 15th, three Japanese aircraft flew to the Chaoyang-Beipiao area, dropping leaflets in the joint name of the puppet government and the Japanese Kwantung Army headquarters, stating that Japan and the puppet state have always used kings to govern the people, and that the people of the three provinces have lived and worked in peace and contentment, each finding their place. Only Rehe remains ravaged by Chinese troops, and a large army will soon be used to drive the Chinese troops out of the province and rescue the people of Rehe from their suffering. Our benevolent and righteous army will not commit the slightest offense as it passes through various places, and anyone who dares to resist will be killed without mercy. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cui Xingwu telegraphed Tang Yulin, stating that the Japanese are rumored to be launching a general offensive three times this month. The Japanese have secretly increased their troop strength significantly in Kailu, and there are small skirmishes every night at the outposts. Japanese aircraft are flying over Chaoyang County daily for reconnaissance and bombing. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Beipiao Railway was cut off by righteous troops last December, the Japanese sent a large number of puppet railway bureau workers to repair it day and night. On the evening of the 13th, it was discovered by a unit of righteous troops, and there was a brief engagement. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that the joint Japanese-puppet forces in the Chaoyang-Beipiao area are scheduled to launch a general offensive against us on the morning of the 15th. According to a telegram from Dong's brigade, there is still no movement on the front lines. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese have recently been forcibly conscripting carts and horses to repair roads in Jinxi-Laofu. Two or three Japanese aircraft frequently come to Liujiazi for reconnaissance. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Fuxin County magistrate telegraphed Tang Yulin, stating that the majority of Japanese troops are advancing towards Fuxin. On the 14th, two enemy aircraft were sighted over Fuxin, dropping three bombs on Hongshitai and Shierjiazi, injuring one civilian. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Rehe Provincial Committee member who came to Beiping stated that there are approximately 140,000 Japanese troops in Suizhong, Yixian, and Tongliao. The enemy's repeated offensives have been thwarted due to: 1) Rehe's terrain consists of many steep mountains, rendering armored vehicles ineffective; 2) the use of Mongolian bandits for assaults is hindered by unfamiliar terrain; 3) our people have cut off the food supply to Japanese military positions and blocked wells with earth.

They train from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day. One Japanese armored train remains stationed at the Yuguan station. The Japanese military is constructing gun emplacements on the West Gate and the Gongchen Gate in the West Pass. The walls around the central city, except for the north side, have been mostly leveled, and shooting holes have been drilled in many places through the city walls. There is one heavy machine gun and two mortars on the North Gate. Two Japanese merchant ships of the Nankai Shipping Company that were docked have departed. Previous reports that the commander of the Japanese forces at Yuguan had committed suicide have been investigated, and it has been confirmed that the deceased was Sato. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Harbin reports that the righteous troops scattered along the east, west, and south lines of the Eastern Railway are extremely active. On the 1st of this month, a freight train that departed from Harbin Main Station to Suifenhe was derailed near the Sanbuhuala small station when the tracks were destroyed by righteous troops, causing significant losses. After the incident, the Yimianpo Station telegraphed the Harbin Main Station to dispatch a rescue train and a large number of workers and protection troops. Due to the severe damage, repairs were not completed for two days, and traffic on the eastern line has been cut off for over three days. On February 2nd, righteous troops attacked the Xilinhe Station. The puppet road protection army headquarters ordered the 18th Regiment of the 7th Garrison Brigade to suppress them. The regiment arrived at Xilinhe Station that night, but there has been no news since. It is rumored that the soldiers of the regiment have completely defected to the righteous troops, but both the Japanese and puppet sides are keeping this information secret.

<h3 id="e6">The United States Prepares to Cooperate with the League of Nations <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Roosevelt Expresses Approval of the Proposal</p>
<p>Will Use All Its Power to Prevent the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, American officials expect that if Japan rejects the Geneva proposal for reconciliation and stubbornly withdraws from the League of Nations, the Western countries will apply diplomatic pressure on Japan through three plans: 1) Accept the Lytton Report as an official statement of the League of Nations; 2) All Western powers will adopt the Stimson Non-Recognition Doctrine, and none will recognize "Manchukuo" or provide economic assistance or other aid; 3) Establish an international committee according to the general outlines of the proposal of the Committee of Nineteen, including the United States and Russia. When Japan appears willing to cease military adventurism in Manchuria, the committee will then mediate between the two sides. American officials also believe that Japan will eventually take this path. It is reported that this plan has been approved by U.S. President-elect Roosevelt. Roosevelt is deeply aware of the danger of conflict between China and Japan in Manchuria, or even in North China. If Japan rejects the League of Nations' proposal, withdraws from the League, and invades Rehe, the conflict could expand to a wider area. Therefore, all countries must do their best to prevent conflict and reconcile disputes. Currently, Washington hopes that Japan can pull back from the brink at the last moment and avoid armed conflict. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>Inviting Member States to Participate in Negotiations</p>
<p>The United States and Russia Have Not Yet Been Invited</p>
<p>South American Countries' Participation Is Undecided</p>
<p>The Committee of Nineteen Still Exists</p>
<p>Closely Monitoring the Rehe War</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations today distributed invitations to member states of the League of Nations and the Committee of Nineteen that have signed the Pact of Paris, inviting them to participate in the negotiating committee. If China and Japan do hold negotiations in the future, this committee will participate in those negotiations. The League of Nations has also decided not to send invitations to the United States and Russia for the time being, pending the passage of the report by the League of Nations General Assembly and the acceptance of the proposal by China and Japan. Although it is generally expected that the negotiating committee will be established and then dissolved, those countries that are invited can only be those that have diplomatic relations in the Far East. South American countries and Switzerland will not be able to join, but Ireland's attitude is still undecided. According to the League of Nations, when the League of Nations General Assembly passes this report, there will be a vote of thanks to the Committee of Nineteen, and the committee will be asked to continue to exist in order to remain in contact with developments in the Far East, because the League of Nations does not want to put this dispute behind it, especially not wanting to ignore the danger of a large-scale war in Rehe.

<p>(Geneva) Thanks to the efforts of our country's representatives, the report has clearly stated that negotiations should first determine the issue of Japanese troop withdrawal, and that the withdrawal should be unconditional, as in the Shanghai incident. However, if both parties accept the report, negotiations should begin within one month, and the negotiating committee should report to the General Assembly on the troop withdrawal situation within three months after the start of negotiations. However, if Japan refuses to accept the report, the report is equivalent to waste paper. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation issued a public statement, saying, "The Chinese delegation finds it very strange that a Tokyo dispatch stated that General Duan Qirui has engaged in preliminary negotiations to begin direct Sino-Japanese negotiations in order to resolve the Manchurian dispute." It should be known that China is united in resisting Japanese aggression to the end. This kind of news fabricated by Japanese interviewers with ulterior motives is a tactic used by Japan as a last resort, hoping to confuse public opinion before the Extraordinary Assembly convenes, because Japan knows that the Extraordinary Assembly will condemn Japan for its aggression. Therefore, this kind of news is absolutely groundless. (Havas Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>The Japanese Delegation Issued a Lengthy Article</p>
<p>Attempting to Shift the Blame to the Committee of Nineteen</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation issued a lengthy article to the press, detailing the attitude adopted by Japan in the recent negotiations and the various continuous efforts made by the Japanese government to resolve the dispute through mediation. It said that the Japanese government, in order to achieve this goal, had accepted concessions on certain points, even though Japanese public opinion attached great importance to these points. The Japanese government did this because it believed that only the method of "direct contact" was sufficient to seek a solution to problems involving such broad and complex issues, and that all decisions made in a vacuum and all constraints that did not have a deep understanding of the actual situation were not the way to solve them. Moreover, all other procedures would be difficult to produce fair and effective results, and even damage the credibility and actions of the League of Nations. Its conclusion, which should be noted, stated, "The Japanese government regrets that the Committee of Nineteen is unwilling to take into account Japan's concessions and the spirit of its negotiations. The reason for the delay in negotiations is that although the Japanese government hopes to produce a possible solution as soon as possible, it cannot make a hasty decision on issues related to Japan's national survival until after careful consideration. Japan has tried its best to promote negotiations within the scope of all possibilities and has always tried to reach a compromise so that it can protect the authority and effectiveness of the League of Nations and the work of the League of Nations in the Far East, and on the other hand, it can preserve Japan's main interests. Japan cannot but express its concern about the decision taken by the Committee of Nineteen, because this decision will inevitably have repercussions on the general situation in the Far East, and the easing and restoration of peace and security in that part of the world (i.e., the Far East) will therefore become more difficult.

<h3 id="e12">The Issue of Reciprocal Tariff Rates Between China and Japan <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The issue of reciprocal tariff rates between China and Japan has been the subject of much discussion and misunderstanding. Some consider it a treaty of commerce between China and Japan, while others consider it a tariff agreement. In reality, the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between China and Japan has long expired and been declared null and void, and the proposed revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has not yet been concluded. The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement is only a transitional measure before the conclusion of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and it cannot be regarded as a treaty of commerce. The so-called reciprocal tariff rates are only an exchange of notes to the appendix of the Tariff Agreement, and have nothing to do with the text of the Tariff Agreement. The content of the exchange of notes only indicates that both governments will maintain certain tariff rates on certain imported goods for a period of three years. The term "maintain" originally implied a temporary nature, and since a period of three years was specified, it would naturally expire after three years. This is distinctly different from other treaties that contain clauses such as renegotiation, renewal, and prior notice. It is indeed as the All-Zhejiang Association's telegram stated: "There is no need to declare cancellation, and there is no reason to amend it." Therefore, to advocate declaring the invalidity of the text of the Tariff Agreement is even more irrelevant and without careful consideration.</p>
<p>This reciprocal tariff rate is reciprocal in name but preferential in reality, as commentators have explained in detail. What we give to Japan, such as unbleached cotton cloth, had an import value of 4.8 million taels over twenty years, and flour had an import value of 12.6 million taels. There are many other items, too numerous to mention. But what the Japanese give to us is only a combined total of ramie cloth, silk, and embroidery, with an annual export value of no more than hundreds of thousands of taels. When dealing with foreign affairs, Chinese officials often only seek a superficial balance in the treaty terms, without weighing the importance of the content. Deceiving themselves and others can truly be described as the height of perfunctory propriety. However, the loss of rights in secret is incalculable.</p>
<p>Now, this tariff rule, which is reciprocal in name but preferential in reality, will expire on May 16th. Various public organizations have made positive proposals, and there is little possibility of renewing the original proposal. Song Ziwen's conversation with reporters in Beiping also stated that he would not renew it. Therefore, it is almost certain that it will be terminated upon expiration. What will be the impact of the termination of this tariff rate? First, most of the treaties that our country has signed with various countries contain most-favored-nation clauses. Therefore, preferential treatment to Japan will inevitably be extended to other treaty countries at the same time. A lower tariff rate on a certain imported commodity from Japan is tantamount to a lower tariff rate on the entire quantity of that imported commodity. These low-tariff imports are naturally the great enemy of domestic products of the same kind. Therefore, after the abolition of the Sino-Japanese reciprocal tariff rate, the increase in tariffs will be very beneficial to domestic industry. Second, the economic aggression of various countries against China includes not only imported goods but also industries in China, such as the Japanese textile industry in China. Its productive capacity is greater than that of Chinese-owned textile industries. The Japanese have been making rapid progress in the operation of the textile industry in China in recent years, knowing that there is little possibility of continuing the reciprocal tariff rate after it expires. Therefore, they must be prepared in advance, think deeply, and be aggressive. Therefore, Chinese industrialists should not hastily consider the protection of tariffs as a success. They must know that foreign industries in China are still their strong enemy.</p>

<p>Differing Opinions Between Diplomatic and Military Authorities</p>
<p>Indication that Plans to Invade Jehol Will Not Be Changed</p>
<p>Matsuoka's Return Date Undecided</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The question of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations remains uncertain. The army seems to advocate that Japan should withdraw immediately if the League General Assembly passes the recommendations of the Committee of Nineteen. However, most officials in the Foreign Ministry and Navy Ministry believe that it would be better to remain in the League if possible. Therefore, judging from the current situation, the chances of Japan remaining in the League seem slightly greater than withdrawing. However, unforeseen events could occur. If foreign criticism provokes national sentiment, the situation could change. Therefore, if the plan to attack Jehol is actually implemented and provokes a reaction from Geneva, it will also provoke a reaction from Japan. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry told reporters that the urgent cabinet meeting held yesterday afternoon resulted in a decision on how to deal with the League of Nations. The contents are: 1) The Japanese government believes that the mediation of the Committee of Nineteen has failed, so there is no need to reply to the second ultimatum. 2) The formal advisory letter will only arrive in Tokyo on the evening of the 16th, but the Japanese government will not make any new compromises or seek help other than convening another emergency cabinet meeting to announce it. 3) At the General Assembly on the 25th, in addition to instructing Representative Matsuoka to submit a statement based on Article 15, Paragraph 5, he will also vote against it at the General Assembly. If the League of Nations still does not understand Japan, then Representative Matsuoka will be instructed to submit a final declaration of disaffiliation at the General Assembly, and at the same time withdraw from Geneva, taking a route through the United States to return to Japan. As for the military issue in Jehol, under the current circumstances, it is unavoidable. Because the Japanese army's attack on Jehol under the Japan-Manchuria Treaty is a matter of eliminating bandits, which is completely different in nature from a war against China. (China United News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's chief representative in Geneva, Matsuoka, requested to return home on February 28th. It is now heard that the government has informed Matsuoka to wait until the cabinet has considered the full text of the League of Nations' recommendations before deciding whether to allow him to leave Geneva on that day. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The puppet Ting Shih-yuan, because the situation between the League of Nations and Japan is on the verge of a head-on collision, has been dodging inside the Japanese delegation for days. Recently, because the puppet state was actually rejected by the League of Nations, he dared to become enraged out of humiliation and made a great show of it. This morning, he told Japanese reporters that he had received a telegram from the puppet Manchurian Foreign Minister Hsieh Chieh-shih, deciding to withdraw from Geneva with Representative Matsuoka after the General Assembly on the 25th, and expressed that Japan and Manchuria would henceforth maintain a solid Monroe Doctrine in the Orient to deal with the League of Nations.

It was unanimously agreed that even if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, there is no reason to abandon the South Seas mandated territories, and the Imperial Government is determined to maintain them.

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon gave a speech in Southampton tonight, stating that the League of Nations has not abandoned its responsibility to the world, nor has it lost its effectiveness. The failure to resolve the Manchurian issue is only a temporary matter. It will continue to fulfill its duty to make recommendations with firmness and fairness, so as to guide and inspire world opinion, and make a full contribution to a satisfactory resolution. However, he also acknowledged that the situation in Geneva is very dangerous, saying that this situation is causing the greatest concern to everyone who supports the League of Nations, because not only is the conflict between the two member states serious and extensive, but its consequences could have a significant impact on the future of the League of Nations. He said that Britain is striving to be a good member of the League of Nations and maintains strong friendships with both China and Japan, because we must do our best to mediate, hoping to achieve reconciliation between the two sides. Simon then explained in detail the power and purpose of the League of Nations, saying that the League of Nations is not a supreme state and has no power to force member states to comply, but only an international organization that seeks to replace force with cooperation and conflict with reconciliation.

However, the exchanges reopened today, and the situation is different from yesterday. Trading has returned to normal. Business leaders believe that the Manchurian dispute will not lead to an economic boycott of Japan and advise businessmen to remain calm and not to hastily believe in impossible events such as economic sanctions. Okazaki, Chairman of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said that even if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will definitely not lead to an economic boycott or war. The President of Mitsubishi Bank also said that if Japan separates from the League of Nations, Japan will seek direct negotiations between China and Japan. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

Because the Japanese army has failed to make any progress after repeated attacks, they have recently changed their strategy and ordered the puppet police to secretly post proclamations in various places, claiming to be Deng Tie-mei's voice, saying that the actions since the incident were intended to redeem the people, but judging from the facts in the past, it was contrary to their wishes. This time, they are resigning from their posts and dismissing their troops, allowing them to return to farming freely. The Japanese army's tricks are pathetic. (Special Telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>The assassin, an Italian bricklayer, was captured on the spot.</p>
<p>The reason for the assassination was hatred of the rich and powerful.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Miami, 15th.</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Roosevelt returned from a seaside vacation and, while passing through here tonight, gave a brief speech to over ten thousand welcoming people. Suddenly, someone fired five shots in an attempt to assassinate him. Fortunately, Roosevelt was not injured, but Chicago Mayor Cermak and five others were seriously injured.</p>
<p>(Five shots fired, five injured)</p>
<p>When Roosevelt was standing in the back of an open-top touring car giving a speech, after about five minutes, having finished his remarks, and stating "sincere thanks to everyone," just as he was about to take his seat, a shot suddenly rang out from the crowd, flying over Roosevelt's head. For a moment, the crowd was in chaos, scrambling to capture the assassin. The bodyguard immediately jumped in front of Roosevelt, hoping to shield him from the bullets with his body. Seeing that there was no more danger, he then assisted in capturing the assassin. But in that instant, the assassin fired four more shots. It is believed that the second bullet hit Chicago Mayor Cermak, who was standing on the running board of the car; the third bullet hit New York detective Sunnode, who was acting as an escort. The remaining two bullets were fired during the assassin's struggle with those who were trying to capture him, hitting Mrs. Gill, the director of the Florida Power Company, Miss Keyes of New Whack, and five-year-old Calderwell of Miami. Except for the child, who was slightly injured, and Mrs. Gill, whose injuries are not expected to be severe, Cermak was shot in the chest, Miss Keyes in the forehead, and Sunnode in the back of the head, all with serious injuries.</p>
<p>(Assassin captured, ten thousand want to tear him apart)</p>
<p>The driver was quite alert and quickly drove the car out of the crowd and towards the train station where the special train was parked, before the police and the crowd could surround the assassin. The scene of the incident was immediately chaotic. Although the assassin was captured, more than ten thousand people surged forward, shouting and cursing, eager to tear him apart. The police tried their best to disperse the crowd, and the anger subsided slightly. The injured were then sent to the hospital, and the assassin was taken to the police station, but the assassin's face had already been severely punched by a veteran.</p>
<p>(Roosevelt remained calm and visited the injured in the hospital)</p>
<p>When Roosevelt arrived at the station, although his face showed a slight hint of tension, he remained extremely calm. After arriving at the station, he immediately ordered a temporary delay in returning to New York and took a car to the hospital to see the injured, greeting them one by one, paying particular attention to the mayor and the child. He then personally called his wife at home in New York to inform her of the details of the incident. According to Roosevelt, Mrs. Roosevelt was also very calm upon hearing the news. He still intends to go to Ithaca to give a speech tonight. Roosevelt then returned to the yacht, stating that he would return to New York by train tomorrow morning. The local American Legion, fearing that there might be other conspiracies behind the assassination, immediately organized a guard to protect the port where Roosevelt's yacht was docked and the city's key points. At midnight, an angry crowd surrounded the prison where the assassin was being held, but was dispersed by the American Legion and the police.</p>
<p>(A woman's bravery in the nick of time)</p>
<p>According to one of the messengers who witnessed the assassination, he saw the assassin bending over for a moment, as if he wanted to pick up something from the ground. After getting up, he leaned forward, pointing the gun directly at Roosevelt. Just as he was about to shout, he suddenly saw a woman step forward and grab his arm. In that instant, the bullet was fired and the entire scene was in chaos. He could no longer see the assassin, but he saw Roosevelt's car speeding away. The woman who grabbed the assassin's arm was Mrs. Cross. Without her action, the assassin would not have raised the muzzle of the gun, and the bullet would have been aimed directly at Roosevelt. Therefore, Mrs. Cross can be said to be Roosevelt's savior. According to her own account, she suddenly saw the assassin holding a gun in his hand, and was so shocked that she could not speak for a moment. Then she jumped forward, shouting loudly, wanting to grab his arm. After that, she was pushed away by the crowd and could no longer see anything.</p>
<p>(The assassin's confession reveals strange reasons for the assassination)</p>
<p>According to the assassin's confession at the police station, his name is Sangara, and he is an Italian bricklayer. He hates all the rich and powerful people in his life, and Roosevelt is one of them, so he wanted to get rid of him. Ten years ago, he participated in two assassination plots against the King of Italy, but both failed because of the crowds around him. This time, when he heard that Roosevelt was visiting Miami, the thought of assassination arose again. He recently had surgery for a stomach ailment, and it is believed that this is why the desire to assassinate him intensified. So he bought a handgun for eight yuan, etc. His attitude at the police station was calm, and he confessed everything directly, answering every question, unlike ordinary criminals. He claimed that since the matter had not succeeded, he was prepared to receive any punishment he deserved.</p>
<p>(President Hoover sends a telegram congratulating Roosevelt on his escape)</p>
<p>President Hoover, upon hearing the news, immediately telegraphed Roosevelt to congratulate him on his escape, and also telegraphed his condolences to the injured. He then sent a special telegram to inquire about Cermak's condition. There have been five U.S. presidents who have been assassinated or endangered. President Lincoln was the first to be assassinated in 1865, President Garfield was assassinated in 1881, both in Washington, D.C., and President McKinley was assassinated in Buffalo in 1901. Former President Roosevelt was assassinated and injured in Milwaukee in 1912. President-elect Roosevelt is the fifth, fortunately unharmed.</p>
<p>(An accomplice posing as a news reporter)</p>
<p>Valenti, who lived with the assassin in the Roosevelt assassination case, was arrested tonight on suspicion of conspiracy. According to reports, Valenti, carrying a large camera, posed as a news photographer and squeezed to the front of the crowd, with the assassin following closely behind. Therefore, Valenti is suspected of assisting in the assassination.</p>
<p>According to unconfirmed rumors from the police station, the assassin confessed that his original intention in buying the gun was to assassinate President Hoover, but then decided to assassinate Roosevelt because he was close at hand. However, police searched the residence of the two and found several clippings, all describing Roosevelt's trip to Miami, and another describing the assassination of President McKinley.</p>
<p>Among the injured, Chicago Mayor Cermak and Mrs. Gill are reportedly in critical condition. The other three have improved. It is reported that when Roosevelt visited Cermak in the hospital, Cermak said he was happy to take the bullet for him, and wished he would be more careful in the future, as the country needed him very much and he should not be in such danger again. When Roosevelt left the hospital, tears were in his eyes.</p>

<p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee today passed a bill authorizing President Hoover to ban the export of arms to countries currently at war, but this bill is limited to the Americas. The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee passed this bill on January 11, without adding any restrictions. The Senate's action at that time was due to President Hoover's letter to Congress on January 10, strongly advocating for the speedy ratification of the 1925 Geneva Convention on the Prohibition of Arms Trade, otherwise, special legislation should be enacted authorizing the President to restrict or prohibit the export of military weapons.</p>

<p>Today is the second day of the Michigan bank shutdown. Hundreds of bank depositors are very excited because the authorities have promised that they can withdraw part of their remaining money tomorrow. It is reported that the local clearing house federation has prepared 25 million U.S. dollars for this purpose. Although the city of Detroit has 9 million dollars in cash deposited in a certain bank, it is still unable to pay its interest debt of 611,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Detroit, 15th.</p>
<p>Representatives of sixty banks outside of Detroit met today with the Governor of Michigan, requesting him to extend the bank suspension payment method. At the same time, President Hoover and Treasury Secretary Mills are drafting a bill for the United States to assist in clearing the depreciated assets of banks. The cash suspension payment method in Michigan applies to bills for water, electricity, gas, and telephone. Insurance companies must accept checks to pay insurance premiums. Half of the wages paid to employees of the municipal government are checks and half are cash.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Detroit, 15th.</p>
<p>The amount of cash transported to this city overnight is between 40 and 50 million yuan. Today, the banks are in a position to pay 10% of the depositors' deposits. Governor Comstock is studying reports from various parts of the state, hoping to lift the payment ban early. It is reported that Kang believes that once the people feel that their deposits are safe, the suspension payment order can be revoked.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bucharest, 15th.</p>
<p>Four thousand strikers at the Romanian railway plant, because their leaders were arrested, entrenched themselves in the factory. Soldiers believed that the strikers, driven by hunger and cold, would leave, but sympathizers of the strikers and relatives of the strikers brought food and supplies for their needs. The soldiers then clashed with them, resulting in twenty people being wounded by machine guns, mostly women. Artillery has now been dispatched to the factory. It is reported that those entrenched in the factory are unarmed. Workers in other parts of Romania have also shown signs of unrest since the start of the anti-communist movement, denouncing the movement as illegal.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bucharest, 16th.</p>
<p>Strikers entrenched in the railway plant and the military exchanged fire, resulting in many casualties. The strikers eventually surrendered. The toll was three workers killed and nine wounded, and one soldier killed and twenty-two wounded.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Japan's Economic Power in Southeast Asia (Singapore Correspondence) <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Japanese regard Southeast Asia as the last resort for overseas development.</p>
<p>The amount of investment and trade each reaches 200 million yuan.</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers have often shouted loudly, "The establishment of the state and armed immigration in Manchuria have focused the attention of the entire country on the Manchurian issue. However, we must not forget that Southeast Asia is the most important market for our country's industry in the 'emergency period' (referring to wartime)." The Japanese have regarded Southeast Asia as the last resort for their overseas development for more than a day. The Japanese say that Japan's relationship with Southeast Asia is geographically and racially closer and more intimate than that of Europe and the United States. However, among the Southeast Asian islands, the only places that have become Japanese agricultural immigration areas are the Shengmao area of the Philippines and northern Borneo. Although the Japanese want to implement their immigration policy everywhere on other islands, they are unfortunately crowded with Chinese, Indian, and Malay laborers who are hardworking, able to endure hardship, and good at planting. Their labor is cheaper than that of the Japanese, and their working ability is stronger than that of the Japanese, which has made the Japanese, who are usually good at exploiting opportunities, unable to exploit them. They say that if the government does not provide special assistance and protection to give Japanese laborers superior conditions, Japanese agricultural immigration will ultimately be very difficult. A rubber plantation in the Malay Peninsula run by a Japanese tried to recruit domestic laborers from Japan for planting, but within a year, they all voluntarily requested to be dismissed. Therefore, although the Japanese have strong capital and large-scale enterprises in Southeast Asia, the transfer of labor is difficult to attract. Therefore, until now, there are only 35,000 Japanese in Southeast Asia, and their growth rate is also extremely slow, which is simply incomparable with the Chinese expatriates who have a strong economic foundation in Southeast Asia and whose number reaches over ten million. Among the 35,000 Japanese expatriates, 13,000 are concentrated in the Lao Mao area in the southeast of the Philippine Islands, and there are about 4,000 each in Manila and Singapore. In other major cities, there are also 50 to 1,000 Japanese expatriates. In New Guinea and the Moluccas Islands and other sparsely populated places, there are also one or two Japanese expatriates living there. According to the latest survey, the number of Japanese expatriates in various places is approximately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) U.S. territory 19,628 people</p>
<p>Lao Mao area 12,537 people</p>
<p>Manila City 3,984 people</p>
<p>Other 3,107 people</p>
<p>(2) British territory 7,649 people</p>
<p>Malay Peninsula 6,989 people</p>
<p>Singapore 3,892 people</p>
<p>Qiu Fuer area 1,654 people</p>
<p>Other 1,543 people</p>
<p>British North Borneo 660 people</p>
<p>and Sarawak Kingdom</p>
<p>(3) French territory 405 people</p>
<p>(4) Siam 46 people</p>
<p>(5) Dutch territory 7,047 people</p>
<p>Java 3,939 people</p>
<p>Sumatra 1,631 people</p>
<p>Celebes 514 people</p>
<p>Borneo 737 people</p>
<p>Dutch New Guinea</p>
<p>Moluccas Islands and other 226 people</p>
<p>Total 35,147</p>
<p>Most Japanese expatriates are engaged in tropical agriculture and forestry, with about 6,500 people or more. The next largest number are merchants, with about 3,500 people, followed by fishermen, with about 2,000 people. There are about 1,000 workers. There are countless Japanese photo studios and barber shops everywhere. In addition, what is particularly special is that the famous Japanese prostitution industry also used to be rampant in Southeast Asia a few years ago. Later, due to the crackdown by the Japanese government, the business gradually decreased. Now most of the brothels are located in the Malay Peninsula, and there are prostitutes and private prostitutes everywhere. In the past, most of the Japanese who came to Southeast Asia were single laborers or merchants. In recent years, they have gradually brought their wives and children. Therefore, in places where there are more than 30 or 40 Japanese expatriates, there is an organization called the Japanese Residents Association. These Residents Associations mostly run Japanese elementary schools to implement Japanese-style education to educate their children. There are now five Japanese elementary schools in the Philippines, six in the Dutch East Indies, and two in the British Islands, for a total of 13 schools. There are 1,600 children attending school. The largest of the Residents Associations is the Lao Mao Japanese Association, which has 8,000 members and has founded two schools.</p>
<p>We have given a general overview of the situation of Japanese expatriates above. Now we will talk about the enterprises run by Japanese expatriates in Southeast Asia. Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is mostly in production businesses, with a total investment of about 190 million yuan. The various aspects of investment are approximately as follows: Tropical plant cultivation enterprise 140 million yuan, Mining 8 million yuan, Fishery 2.5 million yuan, Timber 3 million yuan, Commerce 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>Among the above industries, the tropical plant cultivation enterprise run by Japanese expatriates, along with the South Manchuria Railway business that Japan is diligently running in Manchuria, and the textile business of Japanese expatriates in South China, stand side by side as the three major overseas enterprises of Japan. The largest of the cultivation enterprises is the rubber planting industry, with an investment of about 80 million yuan. There are more than 180 farms, with a leased area of 310,000 acres. The various gardens are scattered in the British Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and other places. The next is the Manila hemp planting enterprise, with an investment of 30 million yuan. There are 45 farms, with a leased area of 70,000 acres. The various gardens are all located in the Lao Mao area of the Philippine Islands. The coconut tree planting enterprise has an investment of 10 million yuan. There are 55 farms, with a leased area of 100,000 acres. The above are the most important of the cultivation enterprises. In addition, Japanese expatriates in various parts of Southeast Asia also run various major agricultural industries such as sugar, coffee, and rice. In terms of fishery, the fresh fish in various major cities in Southeast Asia are supplied by Japanese fishermen. Currently, the people engaged in fishery in Southeast Asia include natives, Chinese expatriates, and Japanese expatriates. As for European and American expatriates, they only invest in hiring native fishermen in Java. Japan is originally an island country by the sea, so its people are good at fishing nets, and the fishing profits are also much higher than those of other countries. Recently, Japanese fishery capitalists have also paid attention to tuna and bonito produced in Southeast Asia, and plan to invest large amounts of capital in fishing for these two types of pelagic fish on a large scale. In addition to cultivation enterprises and fisheries, Japanese investment in Southeast Asia also includes the iron and manganese mining industries in the Malay Peninsula and the forestry industry in various parts of Southeast Asia. Six percent of the iron ore imported by Japan each year is supplied by the Japanese expatriate iron mines in Southeast Asia (Zhouhuoer area).</p>
<p>In summary, the economic power of Japanese expatriates in Southeast Asia is numerically as follows: 35,000 expatriates, an investment of 190 million yuan in enterprises, a trade volume of 200 million yuan between Japan and Southeast Asia, and a trade volume of about 90 million yuan between Japanese expatriates and the world (excluding Japan and Southeast Asia).</p>

<h3 id="e60">Song Ziwen's Words and Actions in Beiping <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government Decides to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Regardless of Success or Failure</p>
<p>Discussing Military and Political Issues with Zhang Xueliang for Several Days</p>
<p>Meeting with Envoys from Various Countries and Chinese and Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence. Song Ziwen arrived in Beiping from Shanghai a few days ago, with his own special mission. At 7 PM on the evening of the 12th, Zhang Xueliang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, hosted a banquet at the Shuncheng Wangfu to welcome him, with more than 30 people attending. During the banquet, Zhang delivered a welcome speech, and Song expressed his admiration for the rapid mobilization of the North China generals after the fall of Yuguan. After the banquet, Zhang invited Song to meet at a certain place until 12 PM, when Song returned to his residence in Dongzongbu Hutong. On the morning of the 13th, he moved to the Yingbin Hotel in the Foreign Affairs Building to work. On the morning of the same day, he met with Zhou Zuomin, Leng Jiaji, and more than a dozen others at the Yingbin Hotel for about half an hour. At 12 PM, Zhang Xueliang invited Song to lunch at the Shuncheng Wangfu. Song returned to the Yingbin Hotel at 2 PM. In advance, Liu Chongjie, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent Wang Chengchuan, Director of the Custody Department, to contact the envoys of various countries and agreed to meet at 2 PM. At 2:10 PM, British Envoy Lambson, French Envoy Wild, American Envoy Johnson, and Chargé d'Affaires of Belgium Graf, successively arrived at the Yingbin Hotel with their entourages. Song met with them separately. At 3 PM, the envoys departed. At 3:40 PM, Zhang Xueliang, accompanied by Liu Duoquan and others, also visited Song at the Yingbin Hotel and held talks downstairs. At around 4 PM, Shang Zhen, Commander of the 29th Army, and Pang Bingxun, Commander of the 40th Army, visited Song. Song received them for about 20 minutes, and then hosted the Beiping press upstairs at 5:10 PM. He returned to his residence in Zongbu Hutong with Zhang in the same car. At 7 PM, he returned to the Shuncheng Wangfu for dinner, where he had concrete discussions with Zhang on military and political issues. Because the matters of contacting various parties in Beiping had not been completed, he would stay in Beiping for another two or three days for a short stay before returning to Nanjing. He had already telegraphed the Executive Yuan, and important matters could be telegraphed to him in Beiping. Song is scheduled to pay a return visit to the envoys of Britain, France, and the United States today (14th) and tomorrow, which is purely a friendly exchange and does not involve any important consultations.</p>
<p>(Talks to the Press)</p>
<p>Song gave a speech to reporters at the Foreign Affairs Building at 4 PM on the 13th, as follows:</p>
<p>(Fight when the enemy comes) I came to Beiping to contact Acting Chairman Zhang and various parties on North China affairs. Finance is certainly an important part of it. My impression after arriving in Beiping is very good. Everyone, whether soldiers or civilians, is excited about Japan. The fact that the armies went to the front line without waiting for the departure fee is a sign of the unity of all parties. The Japanese army has been preparing to invade us for more than ten years, while we initially had no intention of defending against the enemy. Fortunately, the people are excited and will fight when the enemy comes. The Battle of Shanghai is a precedent for this. This is a strong expression of our national character. Last night, Acting Chairman Zhang invited me to a banquet with the generals and discussed the difficult financial situation in North China. Although the central government cannot fully support the North China armies, it will do its best to distribute everything equally. The central government's poverty is no less than that of the provinces. The North China generals are well aware of the central government's situation, so they expressed their satisfaction with the central government's open and sincere approach.</p>
<p>(Focus on Jehol) Jehol's terrain is important and is the gateway to North China. The central government attaches great importance to it. If the Japanese army invades, we will use the strength of the whole country to deal with it, regardless of success or failure. My date of return to Nanjing has not yet been determined. I must wait until the mission in Beiping has a considerable solution before I can leave Beiping. President Wang has left France on the 10th of this month and is expected to arrive in China on the 3rd of next month. Whether I will attend the World Economic Conference cannot be discussed today. I would very much like to go, but it depends on the domestic and foreign situation. Economic cooperation between our country and various countries is also necessary today.</p>
<p>(League of Nations Situation) Regarding the organization of the Negotiation Committee of the League of Nations, our representative in Geneva should have a telegram to Nanjing within days. Because I came to Beiping, I don't know the details. Minister Luo can probably represent the government and express our country's views on this matter. Also, the atmosphere of Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations was initially very strong, but later it became silent due to the League of Nations' pressure. Even if it withdraws in the future, it must fulfill its due obligations within two years in accordance with the agreement. However, Japan's affairs are also very difficult to predict. I have not heard anything about Duan Qirui being appointed Chairman of the National Defense Committee in Nanjing, so it is probably not accurate. The affairs of Sichuan and Guizhou cannot be exhausted in a few words. However, during this period of national crisis, I hope that everyone can resolve their opinions and unite to resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>(Antiques are not treasures) The relocation of antiques from the Forbidden City to the south is not a very important matter. There is a ratio. In the past, during a major earthquake in Rome, the entire city's land was torn apart. Some said that filling it with jewels and precious items would close the gap, but it did not work. In the end, a soldier jumped in, and the ground was restored. What Rome valued was not treasures, but the people. From this, we can see that antiques are not important in our country today. It depends on whether the people can resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>(China-Japan Customs Agreement) The China-Japan Reciprocal Customs Agreement will expire on May 16 of this year. This matter was initially requested by Japan, so it will naturally be cancelled upon expiration. Our country has no need or possibility to renew it. Regarding the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan, I discussed the method with the Shanghai banking community in Shanghai, but it has not been approved by the Central Political Conference. Around March 1, the Central Mint will start minting new coins. Each new coin will be equivalent to 7 qian 1 fen 5 li of silver, that is, 1,000 yuan will be equivalent to 715 taels of silver. If you use 715 taels to exchange silver yuan from the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China, you can get about 1,000 yuan. Over time, silver taels will be abolished automatically.</p>
<p>(Statement to Foreign Reporters)</p>
<p>Song also met with many foreign reporters in the afternoon of the 13th. Song said that Jehol is a part of China's territory, and its importance is the same as that of Guangdong or Jiangsu. Japan's attack on Jehol is no different from an attack on Nanjing. Japan has now seized the entire Northeast of China, but any further advance will be met with resistance. Next, reporters asked Song whether China would declare war on Japan if the Japanese army attacked Jehol. Song replied that the victimized country did not have to be forced to declare war. Japan is the aggressor. It has not declared war on China, but with all its will and purpose, it is actually at war with China. Next, he inquired about the North China issue. Song replied that General Zhang Xueliang is the representative of the central government, and Zhang's actions are only at the command of the central government. Song also expressed his personal opinion, saying that if Japan attacked Jehol according to its threat plan, then the Chinese envoy stationed in Japan seemed to have no need to stay in Tokyo. At that time, it would be meaningless to maintain diplomatic relations with Japan. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">The Judicial Yuan Interprets Important Laws <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The President and Committee Members of the Chamber of Commerce are not Civil Servants</p>
<p>The Commercial Arbitration Regulations are Still Allowed to be Applied</p>
<p>Women's Support for Parents Depends on Their Ability</p>
<p>The Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference of the Judicial Yuan yesterday resolved to interpret several important laws. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(Commercial Arbitration Continues to be Valid) The affairs handled by the president or executive committee members of the General Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce do not involve public affairs, and naturally cannot be regarded as civil servants. As for the mediation and arbitration of industrial and commercial matters, according to Clause 4 of the first paragraph of the Chamber of Commerce Law, it is originally the duty of the Chamber of Commerce. For Chambers of Commerce that have not established a Commercial Arbitration Office, the commercial arbitration matters handled by them should be recognized as valid if both parties are willing to comply. The Commercial Arbitration Office Regulations, which were implemented in the past, are not subordinate laws of the Chamber of Commerce Law. According to the National Government's instructions on August 12, 1927, they should be allowed to be applied except for those that conflict with the program and principles of the Chinese Kuomintang or the laws and regulations of the National Government, and will not become invalid due to the provisions of Article 42 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law.</p>
<p>(Inheritance and Support of Wives and Daughters) A wife inherits her husband's estate in accordance with Article 1144 of the Civil Code, which belongs to the wife's property. There are no restrictions on bringing property to the marriage. As for childless widows and their adopted children, according to Article 1140 of the Civil Code, they do not have the right to inherit the estate of their in-laws in place of their husband or adoptive parents, but may be given an appropriate portion of the estate in accordance with Article 1149 of the Civil Code. Moreover, women should bear the obligation to support their parents in accordance with the law, but their support should be limited to their personal economic ability.</p>
<p>(Exercise of Membership Rights of Commercial Federation) According to the provisions of Articles 38 and 39 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law, although a member representative of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce only has one voting right and one election right, there is no restriction on the right to be elected. According to Article 40 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, it should be recognized that each representative has the right to be elected in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the same law. The so-called one voting right of a member in Articles 38 and 39 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law is the election right. When more than one representative is sent, the representatives should jointly exercise the right to vote, not one of them.</p>

<p>River Ice Freezes and Thaws Repeatedly for Several Days</p>
<p>The Downstream Water Level is Higher Than Last Year's Flood and is Even More Dangerous</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Due to the sudden changes in the weather in the past two days, the river ice in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has thawed and frozen repeatedly, causing the ice floes to block and the water level to rise continuously, which is very dangerous. According to the telegram received by the River Affairs Bureau from the lower reaches, the river ice was frozen to the Tizi Dam on the 12th, and the Shiliu Dam was severely damaged, and the water level rose by 7 gongcun, and the embankment root was 2 to 3 river gongchi. The Ling at Wang Zaojia has not yet moved, and the water level at Qinghe has not yet risen. Another telegram was received from Dama Jia Youke, stating that the water level rose by 5 gongcun.</p>

<p>Bandits Planned to Kidnap the President of the Bank of East Asia, Lurking and Waiting in Front of the Stock Exchange, Would Have Succeeded if Detectives Had Arrived Five Minutes Later, Three Bandits Arrested Successively, Remaining Bandits Escaped, Chief Detective Xie Shuiquan of the General Patrol Room, Discovered that Several Bandits Intended to Kidnap the President of a Certain Bank Near Sichuan Road, Edward Road, at Around 10 AM the Previous Day, and Immediately Ordered Deputy Detective Huang Yongji, Detectives Geng Debiao, Ma Mouxiang, Jiang Shangpei, and Inspectors Huang Fusen, Yuan Xizhong, Li Wenbin, etc., to Station Themselves Near the Area Separately. As Expected, Three Gang Members Arrived, One Loitering Near the Stock Exchange, and Two Standing in the French Concession Opposite. The Detectives, Finding Their Behavior Suspicious, First Arrested the Bandit at the Stock Exchange Entrance, Seizing a Loaded Pistol with Eight Bullets. As They Were About to Arrest the Other Two Bandits on the Opposite Side, They Had Already Fled. They Took the Arrested Criminal Back to the Police Station and Interrogated Him, Discovering His Name Was Shen Baorong, a Native of Tongzhou. According to His Confession, They Planned to Kidnap Shao Jingyun, the President of the Bank of East Asia at No. 72 Sichuan Road. Because They Knew Shao Would Take His Car, No. 23, from His Home at No. 50 Seymour Road to the Stock Exchange at 8:30 AM Every Day, and Leave Around 10 AM to Go to the Bank of East Asia to Work, They Waited in Front of the Stock Exchange to Kidnap Him When He Came Out. If the Detectives Had Arrived Five Minutes Later, They Would Have Succeeded. Their Planned Scheme Was That He, Ding Caixi, and Zhang Asi Would Each Carry a Pistol. After Succeeding, He and Zhang Would Monitor Shao's Actions, and Ding Would Drive the Car to a Foreign House at No. 22, Lane 429, Racecourse Road, to Hide the Ransom Note. He Also Confessed That the Funds for This Kidnapping Were Advanced by Qian Qidong from Qingpu. Ding Caixi Lived at No. 173 Dagu Road. The Leaders of This Case Were Multiple Thugs Like Little Danyang. After Receiving the Confession, Detective Xie Immediately Led Detectives to Ding's Home on Dagu Road and the Bandits' Den on Racecourse Road to Arrest the Accomplices, but They Had All Left. He Left Detectives to Keep Watch. Unexpectedly, Qian Qidong Went to the Bandits' Den and Was Arrested by the Detectives. The Detectives Left to Guard Ding's Home Also Arrested Zhang Honggui, a Native of Wenzhou. All Were Taken Back to the Police Station. After Interrogation, Qian Confessed That Yang Rongqing and Yang Ronglin Initiated the Plan, and He Advanced the Capital of Over 200 Yuan in Three Installments. The Detectives Then Arrested Zhang Jifa, Another Accomplice, at No. 176 Longhua Road in the Chinese Territory, and Temporarily Detained Him at the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Waiting for the Special First Court to Issue a Document to Pick Him Up. Yesterday Morning, the Police Station Escorted Shen, Zhang, and Qian to the Criminal Division of the Special First Court. The Police Station's Lawyer, Ru Baoyi, Explained the Circumstances of the Arrest and Stated That the Case Was Complex, the Police Station Had Not Fully Investigated, Not All Accomplices Had Been Arrested, and Zhang Jifa Was Still Detained at the Public Security Bureau, So the Court Should Issue a Document to Pick Him Up. Therefore, the Police Station Would Not Officially Prosecute the Case Today and Only Asked for Permission to Detain Them. When Interrogated, Both Shen and Qian Confessed Without Denying Anything, and Their Confessions Were Generally the Same as Before. Zhang Honggui Confessed That He Went to Ding Caixi to Collect Old Debts and Knew Nothing About the Kidnapping. The Presiding Judge of the Criminal Court, Qian Hongye, Reviewed the Confessions and Ordered the Defendants to Be Detained for Further Interrogation.</p>

<p>George Bernard Shaw Is 77 Years Old. He Was Born in Dublin, Ireland in 1856. Shaw's Father Was a Small Official, and His Mother Was Very Cultured in Music and Painting. Shaw Was Poor, So He Did Not Receive School Education After Graduating from Elementary School. In 1876, He Followed His Mother to London and Often Studied at the British Museum and Art Museum. Shaw's Writing Life Began at This Time. Until 1892, After Publishing His Debut Play "Widower's Houses," His Literary Fame Gradually Increased. In 1926, for His 70th Birthday, He Won the Nobel Prize. Shaw Is a Socialist. After Visiting Soviet Russia Two Years Ago and Returning Home, His Thoughts Became More Firm. Shaw Has Many Works, Which Have Been Translated into Chinese, Including "Widower's Houses," "Arms and the Man," "Mrs. Warren's Profession," "The Philanderer," "Arms and the Man," "Man and Superman," "Pygmalion," and "The Black Girl in Search of God," Which Was Recently Published in This Newspaper's "Free Talk."</p>
<p>吳淞口外大霧阻滯商輪</p>
<p>Heavy Fog Outside Wusong Estuary Blocks Merchant Ships</p>
<p>The Continuous Rainy Weather in Shanghai Has Not Stopped. Yesterday, the Weather Was Even More Gloomy. In the Afternoon, Heavy Fog Suddenly Descended on the Waters Outside the Wusong Estuary. Ships Coming to Shanghai Along the Coast Were All Blocked by the Heavy Fog and Did Not Dare to Enter the Huangpu River. They Anchored Outside Wusong to Avoid the Fog and Would Sail Into Shanghai After the Fog Cleared. Therefore, All Imported Ships Were Stopped Yesterday Afternoon and None Came. As for the Ningbo Ferry and the Shanghai-Taiwan Ferry, Although They Sailed as Usual, They Often Had to Decide Whether to Go to Sea After Arriving in Wusong.</p>

<p>擱淺</p>
<p>Stranded</p>
<p>Due to the Bad Weather in Recent Days, There Is Often Fog in the Yangtze River. A Large Sandboat of the Shunfeng Sailing Boat Company Was Loaded with a Large Amount of Timber, Gypsum and Medicinal Materials from the Upper Reaches and Was Transported Downstream. The Sandboat Sailed to the River Surface 40 Miles Away from Anqing, Encountered Bad Weather and Reduced Water, and Was Stranded. The Boat Was Heavily Loaded, Causing It to Sink Into the Sand and Mud, and It Could Not Be Moved Out for a While.</p>
<p>撞毀</p>
<p>Collision</p>
<p>The Jiangjing River Boat of the China Merchants Bureau Was Loaded with Goods and Passengers from Hankou and Was Sailing Back to Shanghai. It Passed Through the Upper Reaches of Anqing and Happened to Be at Night. The River Boats Were Usually Responsible for the River Pilots. At That Time, the Jiangjing River Boat Was Sailing Past the Stranded Sandboat. Due to the Darkness at Night, the Sandboat Did Not Hang a Red Light, Resulting in a Collision. The Jiangjing Heavily Loaded and Collided Violently, Causing the Sandboat to Be Destroyed Immediately. The Goods in the Boat All Fell Into the Water, and the Boat Was Also Cracked and Sunk.</p>
<p>交涉</p>
<p>Negotiation</p>
<p>After the Sandboat Was Hit, Four Escort Personnel on the Boat Immediately Took the Jiangjing River Boat to Shanghai to Negotiate with the Bureau, Saying That the Stranded Boat Was Hit and That the Responsibility Was on the Jiangjing. The Total Loss of Goods Reached More Than 10,000 Yuan, and the Boat Was Also Damaged. The River Pilot of Jiangjing Said That the Boat Did Not Hang a Red Light, Which Was Difficult to Distinguish at Night, and He Would Not Be Responsible. Yesterday, Shunfeng Company Issued a Loss Sheet to the China Merchants Bureau for Compensation.</p>
<p>撈貨</p>
<p>Salvage</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau Sent a Telegram to the Anhui Branch to Investigate the Truth of the Accident. On the One Hand, It Ordered the Nanjing Branch to Send a Small Boat and Workers to the River Surface at the Scene of the Collision to Try to Salvage the Sunk Sandboat Cargo, Because a Large Amount of Timber Was Scattered After Entering the Water and Could Still Be Salvaged to Reduce Losses. Regarding the Issue of Responsibility, the Fault Lies with the River Pilot on the Boat and Has Nothing to Do with the Boat Owner. This Matter Is Still Under Negotiation. Fortunately, No Lives Were Injured.</p>

<p>市聯會國貨委員會宣言</p>
<p>Declaration of the National Products Committee of the Municipal Federation</p>
<p>The National Products Movement Committee of the Shanghai First Special Zone Citizens' Federation Issued a Declaration Yesterday, Saying, "The Poverty and Weakness of Our Country Can Be Said to Have Reached the Utmost Today, and There Is Nothing More to Add. The Economic Aggression of the Powers Is One of the Main Reasons. The Rural Economy Has Been Declared Bankrupt, and Handicrafts Have Suffered Natural Elimination, Because the Social Customs Are Becoming More and More Extravagant. Even Daily Necessities Are Not Foreign Goods and Are Not Enough to Show Their Wealth. Watching the Rights and Interests Spill Over, the Heart Is Extremely Painful. Although the Voice of Advocating National Products Has Spread Throughout the Country in Recent Years, the Speakers Are Sincere, and the Listeners Are Scornful, So the Effect Is Probably Only One Ten-Thousandth. Leaving Others Aside, Even in Shanghai, Every Time It Receives a Stimulus, There Must Be a Rebound. However, It Is Like a Flash in the Pan, and It Passes in an Instant. Is It Not Only Being Ridiculed as a Five-Minute Fever? My Colleagues Are Distressed, and They Intend to Set an Example by Starting with the Members of This Association, Gradually Reaching Other Sectors, First Making the Hatred of Goods Disappear from the Market, and Then Seeking a Fundamental Solution to Eliminate All Foreign Goods, and Striving to Achieve the Ultimate Goal of National Goods Saving the Country. However, the Rise and Fall of the Country Are the Responsibility of Every Individual. I Hope That Our Citizens Will Follow Their Conscience, Rise Up at the News, Work Together to Save the Crisis, and the Country Will Be Fortunate, and the Nation Will Be Fortunate. This Is a Declaration, and I Hope You Will All Be Aware."</p>

<p>篷路寬度改爲五十呎</p>
<p>The Width of Peng Road Was Changed to 50 Feet</p>
<p>At a Joint Meeting of the Works Committee and the Traffic Committee of the Public Works Bureau on February 7, the Director of the Works Department Proposed to Revise the Road Construction Route of Peng Road. For Lot No. 903, Which Was Proposed to Be Taken Over for One Mu, One Fen, Two Li, and Eight Hao, It Was Revised to Only Take Over Seven Fen and Three Li. Therefore, the Land Purchase Fee Can Be Saved by About 32,000 Taels, and A Certain Amount Can Be Saved for Lot No. 901 West of Yixi. According to the Existing Plan, Peng Road Is Actually in the Form of a Gourd Mouth, but the Convenience of Driving Is Not Worth the Extra Cost of Purchasing Land. Therefore, It Is Advocated that the Width of the Road Should Be Changed to Be Consistent in the New Plan. The Director of the Police Department Also Expressed His Approval for This Proposal. Later, a Certain Committee Member Spoke, Saying That the Owner of the Lot Had Prepared a Development Plan for His Land According to the Original Route, Which Took a Lot of Thought. Now, If the Remaining Land Is Enlarged and the Land Purchase Fee Is Reduced, the Owner Will Definitely Feel More Difficult. After Discussion by Various Committee Members, It Was Decided to Adopt the Proposed Revised Route in Order to Save Expenses. Peng Road Will Be Uniformly 50 Feet Wide, and the Amount Taken Over for Lots No. 903 and No. 901 Will Be Reduced Accordingly. This Proposal Has Been Approved by the Board of Directors on the 15th and Will Be Implemented.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market opened fairly flat. Although it saw a slight firming, it was not excessive. After that, it was once seen trending looser, and finally slightly flat. The morning opening was because the broad rate narrowed by 125, and the exchange rate also fell by 625, but the American silver rate did not move, and the forward silver price rose by more than one li.

<p>Yesterday's silver dollar trend was slightly more active than in recent days. In terms of dollar transactions, there seemed to be some slight appetite from outside. Silver remittances and settlements were also busier for banks than in previous days. It can be seen that the market has seemed to improve recently. However, the silver and money industries, regarding the markets of various industries, due to the tense atmosphere in North China, commerce has been greatly affected, and they have not dared to lend freely. As a result, they still hold to a firm and cautious approach, resulting in financial flow that is not as smooth as desired, which is concerning.</p>
<p>(Foreign exchange rate suddenly rose by half a li. Silver overnight rate still opened with interest-free borrowing. The afternoon market continued to rise by 2 hao and a half, to 7 qian, 1 fen, 5 li, 3 hao and 7 hu and a half, resulting in an improvement of half a li compared to the previous day, with a better situation.

<p>Yesterday's market saw a slight use of foreign exchange from various industries, turning to the silver and money industries to purchase, so the market was in very high demand, while the supply side was very sluggish, resulting in insufficient supply. Morning market exchange drafts were only 750,000, and the afternoon market only 740,000. Banknotes were 40,000 in the morning market and 20,000 in the afternoon market.

<p>丨Results Showed Many Ups and Downs丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's public bond market on the Chinese Securities Exchange. Because the diplomatic situation does not show any signs of easing, and a war seems imminent. The Japanese stock market has been plummeting and there are talks of closing the market, reflecting the war atmosphere permeating the entire country. People are feeling increasingly panicked. The opening price in the first session this morning for the 18th issue suddenly rose by 1 yuan and 2 jiao. Because the buyers of this type of bond all take delivery, it has lost its speculative nature. Therefore, when short sellers want to cover their positions, they have no choice but to raise prices to get the goods. Hence, there are frequent anomalies, which are unrelated to the overall rise and fall of the bond market. After this, the demobilization and troop reduction bonds only fluctuated by 1 jiao or 5 fen. The 19th Customs and 19th Rehabilitation bonds fell by 4-5 jiao to 7-8 jiao because short sellers slightly engaged in swaps, with near months being high and far months being low. The 20th-year bonds were mostly sold out in the 17th and 32nd issues. Although there was some short covering in the 11th issue, it was not substantial. Therefore, all kinds of bonds continued to fall by 4-5 jiao to 7-8 jiao. Sentiment was even more unstable in the second session. The 44th and 47th issues were also sold out, and the market price continued to fall by a small number of jiao to 1 yuan. However, the 20th series was relatively strong. At the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere was quiet. Retail investors still had sporadic sales, but the financial community still had an appetite for buying. However, due to the clearing of transactions, the market price fell wearily by several jiao. At the closing, rumors spread that the Japanese army and navy had disagreements on foreign policy, and the diplomatic situation might change. Market sentiment improved, and various factions had to cover their positions due to the large number of short sellers. The financial community continued to buy, and people's confidence grew stronger. The 4th and 47th issues were all bought in, and the market price rebounded uniformly by 7-8 jiao, and the situation suddenly changed. This turnaround was anticipated by the reporter. As the settlement approaches, short sellers will inevitably have some concerns. As a result, the rises and falls compared to the previous day were mixed, with very small numbers, only 5 fen to 5 jiao higher or lower. Among them, the demobilization bond, 19th Customs, 19th Rehabilitation, and 20th Customs were slightly lower by 2-3 jiao, while the whole six bonds fell by 5 jiao alone. The remaining bonds rose by 5 fen to 3-4 jiao each. The total number of transactions was 8,782,000 yuan, of which only 2,000 yuan was for spot goods, and 8,780,000 yuan was for futures. The number of transactions was still the highest for salt tax, accounting for over 3,100,000 yuan. Troop reduction was the next highest, accounting for 1,395,000 yuan. Consolidated tax accounted for slightly over 1,200,000 yuan. The 19th Customs and 20th Cigarette and 20th Customs each accounted for around 1,000,000 yuan. The remaining transactions were slightly less. New York Stock Market Continued to Weaken</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on the 15th, the New York Stock Market initially firmed because news came from Washington that the domestic banking system would not be adversely affected by the Michigan financial panic. American Telegraph and Telephone Company announced that dividends would remain unchanged. However, due to the publication of the New York Public Utilities Commission's annual report, which hinted that public utilities companies should reduce fees, public utilities stocks were very weak. Later, most stocks also fell back. The Sino-Japanese incident had no impact, but Japanese securities, raw silk, and Japanese gold exchange rates all plummeted. The Deputy Presiding Judge of the New York Court is currently not accepting the trial of the liquidation case of the Electric Film Company, and at the same time, there is an unconfirmed rumor that Fox Film Company is about to negotiate taking over the operations of Paramount Film Company. The total number of transactions for the day was 750,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day Thirty Industrial Stocks 56.71 Fell 0.04 Twenty Railroad Stocks 27.38 Fell 0.07 Twenty Public Utility Stocks 23.97 Fell 0.39 Forty Bonds 79.69 Fell 0.05 Yarn Market Yarn Flower Affected by Air, Price Fluctuations Become Abnormal</p>
<p>The New Low Price of This Month Was Found to Be 137 Taels</p>
<p>Returning to the yarn market, the rises and falls are uncertain, like a violent storm. People's minds are very confused, completely dominated by the current situation. Rumors in the market are numerous, making it even more difficult to calm down. Speculators' minds are heated, so transactions increase and fluctuations become even greater. In fact, financial emergencies are occurring in all areas, and purchasing power is weak, so prices should be weak. But one faction, due to the serious current situation, is eager to sell, while the bottom line has already dried up, and many new long positions are being taken. Therefore, sudden rises and falls are difficult to predict.</p>
<p>(Human Standard Decreased in the Morning and Rose in the Afternoon) The opening of the human standard market in the morning was due to unfavorable news about the current situation, and the suspension of auctions in various Japanese industries, which led to short selling activities. Yarn from a certain country fell by 3, 4, and 5 yuan, so long positions panicked again, and each month fell by 6, 7, 8, and 9 qian. The lowest point of the current month was discovered to be 137 taels, which is 1 tael and 3 qian lower than the low price in mid-June of last year. After the afternoon opening, Yunnanese dealers slightly needed spot yarn, and the market sentiment was slightly firm. After the second and third auctions, news came that yarn from a certain country had soared by 6-7 yuan, and the market sentiment became even stronger. Each month rose by 9 qian to 2.1.2.5 qian. The total number of transactions for the day was 51,450 bales. A check of sales revealed that Changfeng sold 2,000 bales, Chunji 900 bales, Jifeng 750 bales, Daji 700 bales, Taishengkang 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 1,050 bales, Senkang 700 bales, Yichang 1,050 bales, Renfeng 800 bales, and Huachang 700 bales. Purchases included Meiji 1,200 bales, Yukang 3,200 bales, Mingde 1,400 bales, Taixing 950 bales, Shenchang 1,000 bales, Renfeng 1,250 bales, and Xinhua 1,000 bales. Closing prices are as follows. The human standard closing prices showed a surplus or deficit: May 1424 +237, 370 February 1388 +529, 100 June 1433 +525, 400 March 1397 +246, 900 July 1436 +316, 550 April 1412 +246, 950 Total: 202,250</p>
<p>(Fujian Dealers Collected More Spot Yarn) There were slightly more ways to sell spot yarn, and it was slightly more active than yesterday. However, large-scale transactions were still lacking. According to statistics, 743 bales were purchased by various dealers throughout the day. The market sentiment fell by 2 qian and a half to 5 qian in the morning and remained flat in the afternoon. The purchase amount for each dealer is as follows: Yunnan 400 Guangdong 150 Mainland 73 Ningbo 2 Fellow Dealers 25 Weihaiwei 20 Shantou 40 Xiamen 30 Fujian 2 Cotton Market The Cotton Market Process Was Chaotic</p>
<p>The cotton market first fell and then rose, and the market sentiment was extremely complex. However, the trend was higher than the yarn market because of the lack of bottom goods and the few sources of supplies, and the long positions were tight and not released. However, actual needs were clear. Indian cotton began to be transacted for several thousand pieces (the above is medium-grade goods). What the future holds still depends on the exchange rate and India. The cotton market was smaller.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Began Low and Continued High) The Zheng Standard market in the morning opened poorly, and Indian cotton fell again by 2-3 rupees, which led to weak confidence, and each month fell sharply by 4 and 5 qian. After the second and third auctions, it slowly rebounded. As a result, each month fell by 1.4 qian. In the afternoon, each month rose by 2.4 qian following the yarn market's increase. The total number of transactions for the day was 100,600 dan. Sales included Yuande 6,400 dan, Renfeng 6,300 dan, Hengyi 4,500 dan, Changfeng 2,200 dan, Yifeng 7,900 dan, Ruiyuan 2,400 dan, and Yuanda 1,700 dan. Purchases included Yu Kang from Hong Kong 6,600 dan, Gengfeng 6,900 dan, Yuanren 3,900 dan, Dachang 1,300 dan, Dafeng 1,200 dan, Mingde 1,200 dan, and Yongda 1,200 dan. Closing prices are as follows. The Zheng Standard rise and fall showed a surplus or deficit of the number of accounts: May 5215: +77,700 February 5140: +68,100 June 3220 -0559,500 March 3175 +0594,400 July 3235: +39,800 April 3190 -0596,200 Total 435,700</p>
<p>(Cotton Needs to Be in a Stagnant State) Spot cotton needs are stagnant. Supply sources include 550 bales of Yao Huihua, 30 taels of Rangoon flower, and 1,500 pieces imported by the Shenxin Factory. Spot goods loaded immediately. American cotton resisted the empty market and rose slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was stable and firm due to purchases from fellow dealers, short covering, and a lack of sellers. Futures rose by 4-6 pounds, and spot goods rose by 5 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 1-2 points, and spot goods fell by 13 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 12 points. Indian cotton weakened due to the fall in American cotton and speculative selling, with Pingguoer falling by 3 rupees, Aomula falling by 3.25 rupees, and Bairoxi falling by 3.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 15th) American Cotton Compared to the Previous Day Composite Shanghai Standard British Cotton Compared to the Previous Day Composite Shanghai Standard 3 595 +4 28.30 2 473 Flat 32.30 5 608 +6 29.00 3 475 Flat 32.40 7 620 +5 29.60 5 476 Down 1 32.50 10 639 +4 30.50 7 478 +2 32.60 12 652 +5 31.10 10 483 +2 33.00 1 657 +5 31.40 Spot 489 133.40 Spot 605 +5 28.90 Egyptian 703 12 48.00 Pingguoer 145.25 -3.00 22.90 Aomula 163.00 -3.25 25.60 Bairoxi 180.50 -3.50 28.40 Cottonseed Continued to Fall by 2 Jiao</p>
<p>After cottonseed fell slightly by 1 jiao the day before yesterday, there were few transactions in Beijing. Because reports indicated that Sino-Japanese relations were worsening and the market became more uneasy, the price of seeds was reduced by 2 jiao after an emergency meeting of the association. It was also heard that only a small amount of spot goods were accepted and futures were rejected. If the situation worsens again, there will be a continued decline. Grain and rice markets showed no significant fluctuations.</p>
<p>丨Wood Street Smoothly Procured Late Rice丨</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources were over ten. There was a slight appetite from urban and rural stores. Due to the rain, there were few customers. After the Jiangsu-Zhejiang dealers sold some, although the way out was not strong, the market situation was able to stand. The bag appetite was only five or six hundred stones. Because the market price in other places was not suitable, merchants were unwilling to handle more. Those who handled them were still professionals in the industry. This type of goods all selected high-grade rice. The market price of Qingjiao's rice could be stable.
