<h3 id="c18">黃河水災之敎訓　　梓 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>此次黃河水災。延及五省。據黃河水利委員會委員長李儀祉報告。沿河省份受災面積。約一萬五千餘方里。災民達一百十餘萬。其受災情形。以魯西十八縣爲最慘。冀南三縣次之。豫省沿河十餘縣又次之。徐東三縣僅屬餘波。陜西報災達三十縣。則非盡由於黃河之漫溢也。水災之起。以七月下旬陜西大雨河满爲最先。八月三日冀南匪决長垣之堤。淹及濮陽東明。上游水漲。冀南堤決。水流加速。於是八月中旬。豫境黃河漫溢。蘭封決口以後。大水下灌魯西。曹州一帶。遂遭其殃。蘭封之水。東入淤黃河。徐東豐沛各縣。乃亦延及。　　目前秋汛稍平。災害可免增重。辦理急賑。趕速堵口修堤。自爲急務。惟吾人綜核此次黃河水災開始以來四十餘日之紀載。追憶長江夏汛中月餘之恐怖。以爲中國今日。統一治水之政。籌撥巨欵。大舉興辦水利。實已刻不容緩。此亦黃河水災給予我國政府之一大敎訓也。昨報載内政部謀統制全國水利。有召集水利會議之準備。就内政部職責言。是舉極有意義。但就政府整個治水行政言。則在此次水災以後。似不應僅止於此。現在國民政府下之專任水利行政者。有黃河水利委員會。導淮委員會。廣東治河委員會。揚子江水道整理委員會。華北水利委員會。更加以兼有治水職責之全國經濟委員會。建設委員會。機關林立。所費不爲不多。而成績如何。國人只須一審察半年來之事實。即可知之。此何如澈底改组各水利機關。成立一大規模全國水利委員會之較爲適當乎。有大規模之水利委員會。集中治水人才。平時負責指導民間之疏導修繕植林等有益水利事宜。有事急往辦理治標工作。振作精神。實心任事。其成績之必較現在精力分散者爲佳。可以斷言。即如此次黃河水災。姑置陜西河满於天災之列。而長垣之决堤。假使能有負責者趕速補救。冀南必不至受災如此重大。水至蘭封。假使護堤者爲具有水利知識經騐之專員。堤或可保。魯西亦不至成爲譯國。此其近例也。</p>
<p>治水專撥巨欵。亦爲政府所亟應實行之事。此次黃河水災。行政院議给四百萬元。姑無論災情如此。重大。災民如此衆多。有類盃水車薪。即使足用。其用途亦只消極的救濟。而不能積極的建設。此何如豫先籌撥巨欵。從事防災之較爲有利乎。棉麥借欵。旣决定用於復興農村。水利事業。與復興農村有重要關係。當局者倘能於五千萬美金中。指撥五分之一。即可暫顧一時。願當局勿吝惜之。</p>
<p>中國大江河遍境内。每年夏秋汛期。非此則彼。必有水災。枝枝節節而。救濟之。金錢無異虚擲。用棉麥借欵之一部分。藉國聯水利專家之技術。積極興辦水利。此國人之所望於當局。亦當局所可藉以表示其愛民之心者也。</p>

<h3 id="c140">討論到銀問題 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>必須先談到銀價跌落的原因、此原因不外兩種、第一是與政治有關係的、第二由於不景氣、我們知道、銀價漲則物價因之而高、銀價跌物價亦隨之而跌、這因爲銀雖爲貨物之一種、尙有幾個國家用以爲貨幣故也、但這種定例、有時也會改變、如歐戰時之特殊情形、然平時銀價、總成爲、</p>
<h3 id="c141">物價之寒暑表 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>一八九六年、美國亦因不景氣的緣故、曾經閙過一次極大的風潮、當時有波拉Bｏｙａｌ主張金銀幣自由鑄造銀與金的比例、爲十六對一、得到民主黨候選總統指爲貨幣解放運動Ｆｒｅｅ　（ｏｉｎａｇｅ　Ｃａｍｐａｉｇｎ後來到一八九九年、方才感覺到金的缺少、據國聯金委員會的報告、要是當初没有發現阿拉斯加的金礦、世界上的金子、早已不夠支配了、歐戰以後、各國努力增加生產、豈知起初因戰時損失、大家設法補充、貨物尙有銷路、後來貨物愈積愈多、物價也隨之而跌、於是大家就設法把貨物要向外推銷、引起</p>
<h3 id="c142">國際貿易戰爭 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>以致發生今日全世界不景氣的現象、其次銀價爲什麽與政治有關係呢、自從英國减少銀輔幣成分以後、各國皆隨之實行、印度自一九二六年根據是年ＲｏｙａｌＣｏｍｍｉｓｉｏｎ的報告、也仿造起來、他把市面流通的羅比、漸漸收回、陸續將庫存銀塊售出、到一九二九丨一九三二年間、銀價跌落、不可收拾、當時、</p>
<h3 id="c143">影響我國很大 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>經濟家研究結</p>
<p>果、想禁止銀進口、但是爲維持國際上貿易、我政府表示反對、可是當時曾有信致印度政府、希望他們改變售銀的政策、同時白銀出產最多的時候、要算一九二九年、竟有二萬六千二百萬盎士之多、一方面因爲不景氣　銀子的銷路减少、一方面因爲各國政府的售出、與銀產的增加、銀價自然愈跌愈下、於是維持銀價的聲浪愈高、美國人民、對於銀似乎有特别好感、其實美國產銀的數量、還在墨西哥之下、據說因</p>
<h3 id="c144">歷史上的關係 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>成了一種迷信心、所以在這次會議上非常重視、不惜多方征求專門學者的意見、結果、覺得銀價實有維持之必要、在倫敦會議、美國提出維持銀價的辦法有三種步驟、第一、貨幣仍當用金、第二節省金的用途、凡用金之國、祗可以金作準備金、及國際貿易上不足之用、一面收回民間窖金、凡工業必須用金者、要請求政府許可後、向市購買、其交割须經過各國的中央銀行、第三、中央銀行現金準備、减爲百分之二十五、其中百分之二十用金、百分之五或可用銀、但購進之銀、應與其他物價相等、此種計劃很與維持銀價有關係、</p>
<h3 id="c145">至於通貨澎漲 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>雖爲提高物價</p>
<p>之一種策略、但各貨物實際無銷路、則漲價爲一時的、且含有極大的危險性、華盛頓談話會中、美國已與數國談過、這種計劃、大體雖然無異議、但對於白銀、加入準備、英法等國、覺得尙須考慮、蓋提高銀價一層、當時有兩方辯論、一方以爲恐影響我國出口、一方以爲於我國有益、可增加購買力、美當局曾質之於我國代表、當時答以如果物價提高、銀價當然要漲、但希望銀價不高於一切物價之上、總以相等於一般物價爲原則、而同時希望有一穩定銀價的辦法、白銀問題在、</p>
<h3 id="c146">倫敦經濟會議 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>之中不過是丨</p>
<p>極小的問題、但因爲美國有用銀加入準備的提案、故小組會中有銀的一組、加入銀委員組者、計有十三國之多、此組推美國代表畢德門氏爲主席、畢氏是一位自信力極强的人、認爲自已對於銀問題、極有研究把握、彼謂、銀價跌落、實由於印度紊亂價格之故、挽救之法、惟有沮止各政府將存銀售出市面、并停止其征收銀稅、當時頗多辯論、蓋各有其困難情形、於是在會外商定、由產銀國政府、共同承請印度政府存銀之一部份、我國</p>
<h3 id="c147">代表從中疏解 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>頗盡奔走之力、及討論至印度每年售出三千五百萬時、忽生波折、蓋西班牙亦欲賣出、他的中央銀行庫存有一萬萬盎士之鉅、結果、承認每年出售五百萬盎士、其印度政府售出部份、由美國每年購進二千四百萬、其餘一千一百萬、由各國分攤、以墨西哥最多、坎拿大次之、後來恐怕各國無力購買、*</p>
<p>不履行合同、又經多方磋商、印度要求美國担保、美國表面上頗難承認、但結果暗示可由美方保障、此爲、</p>
<h3 id="c148">銀恊定之大槪 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>及討論至原議案銀輔幣成色須提高至百分之八十及政府不得將鎔幣之銀出售市面時、荷蘭代表又起而反對、因爲他們處現在會議情勢之下、不欲在任何方面、受任何束縛、後來意大利也附和之、再經磋商之後、始以銀合同有效時期爲有效、畢德門氏之硬態、實使會塲空氣惡劣、不過美國亦爲存銀極多之國、各國亦不能不稍加顧忌、遂彼此遷就、成立一種恊定、該恊定於明年一月一日實行、其中我國所負之責任、卽第四條之規定、我國於四年内、不得將貨幣鎔化、减低成色、而將</p>
<p>餘銀出售也、蓋康末爾建議之金本位辦法、中有經過此項程序之必要、該項條欵特加防範耳、此外關於恊定種種經過、尙多複雜、惜爲時間所迫、不及詳細奉告云、</p>

<p>— 仰莽</p>
<p>日本對外貿易之發展，工廠出品之暢銷，說者均歸功於日本政府贊助下之同業統制。最可慨者中國之同業公會，勢力極微，辦法不一，以故仍各自爲謀，只顧個體之發展，而無通力合作一致對外之精神。以視日本人之肯犠牲，肯猛進，賦予同業公會以極大之權力者，誠不可同日而語，顧實行同業統制，不但中國工商界目前無此力量，在事實上亦有極大之困難。蓋實行統制，最大要件有三。一曰統計，一曰人才：三日道德。無精密之統計，則盈虚消長，漫無稽考，旣不知人，又不知已，是猶烏合之衆，猝臨完整之軍，安得不失敗，安得不退步。無專門之人才則管理不講，技術不精，成本不廉，出品不良，旣研究之乏人，更考核之無術，安能實行，安能收效，無完美之道德，則爭逐嫉妒，惟利是圖，彼此傾軋，彼此</p>
<p>衝突，實行其「你死我活」之手段，甚至有約則可以任意破毁，業規行規視若具文，結果依然同床各夢，暗潮迭起，此種公會，有等於無，何可持久？故今日國貨事業之不易進步、而不能一致對外者，即爲同業公會之無統制力。此則最痛心而無可如何者也。惟是人進我退，人迫我讓，苟不覺悟，何以圖存。此尤望同業之急起直追澈底覺悟，以應付此千百重之難關也。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3 id="c164">談談國貨的原料問題 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 秉仁</p>
<p>提倡國貨是對外抵抗經濟侵略對内扶助實業發展的一個有效辦法、其意義至爲深切，近年來籟國人的覺醒，這工作果已見相當效果。國貨工廠一面旣立下了比較穩固的根基，一面就格外致力於出品的研究改進，國貨聲譽日益隆盛，到處受着熱烈的歡迎。照現狀看來，如各工廠能不斷的努力，前途的發展眞是未可限量的。但在這國貨節節發展的今日、，頗有人檢討到國貨的原料問題。原料，它是出品之母，關心國貨的同時關心到它的原料，確是比較的深入一層；而我們爲愛護國貨起見，對於這問題也確認爲有加以檢討的必要。本來國貨的製造應完全採用國產原料，眞是毫無疑義的事，因爲提倡國貨，原爲塞漏巵，挽利權，若用舶來原料，則何以貫澈提倡國貨的眞義。然事實或有未盡然者，且往下看吧：　　這次中華國貨指導所舉辦全上海國貨工業總調查，對於各廠採用原料情形，特别注意，據調查結果，各門各類的廠家不免用些舶來原料，不過這倒不是各廠甘用外貨，實在還是國產，原料太缺乏了的緣故啊！該所調查時並和各廠的負責人研究到這問題，在各廠也很以無國貨可用爲憾！現舉幾個最著的例如左：</p>
<p>（一）紡紗業　照全國推算，每年要用棉八百餘萬擔，而國產棉花，即値豐收之年，亦不及此數　，且又因質粗絲短，各廠紡十六支以上之紗，即非攙用外棉不可，是質量方面國產俱不足供給各廠所需，而各廠在不得已之情形下，祗能酌量購用外棉。</p>
<p>（二）織造業　棉織針織二者，俱以紗線及染色顏料爲主要原料。吾國紗廠尙在紡粗紗時期、四十二支以上較細紗線，尙不能產，於是各廠要用細紗的就不能不仰給外貨。至染色顏料，吾國祗有天然植物一種，於現代最進步之人造顏料，則毫無生產，各廠爲求使用利便與成本經濟起見，遂不得不購染料於外商。　　（三）絲織業　在今日絲織市塲，交織物與人絲織物殊佔重要地位，而此二種織物原料丨人造絲，國内即絕無產者，各廠旣不能葉此不織，其向國外購用原料，又爲事勢所必然矣。</p>
<p>（四）機器業　機器及其附屬品之製造，以鋼鐡爲原料，而國内祗有六河溝生鐡之產，熟鐡與鋼，則均闕如。前漢治萍公司冶廠產鐡，漢廠鍊鋼，其出品原可供一部份工廠需要，但以連年兵燹之禍，整個公司歸於停頓。故今日各廠需用鋼鐡原料，除生鐡以外，竟不能不全部仰給於舶來品。其他如化學工業之三酸基本原料，五金器具業之鐡皮，造紙業之木漿，橡膠業之樹膠等，因國產未能供給或不足供給不能不用外貨，眞是舉不勝舉。槪括的看來，國貨確正患着極嚴重的原料荒；因爲要從事製造，遂祗能借用舶來原料來救荒。然而因國產原料的少得詫異，舶來原料的輸入也就多得驚人了！　　臨了，得鄭重地聲明一下的就是目前的國貨雖多少含有舶來原料的成分，但這旣不是廠商的甘用外貨，又不是絕對没有希望漸漸改善的，一切全是一時的過渡現象，愛用國貨的人得更熱烈地來愛護這正在前進的國貨纔是呵！</p>

<p>國民政府主席林子超氏，來滬養疴，每微服出行，頗得眞樂，昨晨九時許、親臨中國國貨公司，（南京路大陸商塲）該公司事前未知，即由某君招待，陪同參觀各部，主席在料器部購一捕蠅器，電器部選購綢燈罩數事，九九商塲，主席極贊各種貨品售價之低廉，擇其心愛者購去，樂器部主席購一製作精雅之月琴，彈弄有頃，頗覺奇趣，糖果部亦購食品數種，主席之躬自親臨選購國貨，足見關懷國貨事業，若吾國朝野一致服用國貨，則富强指日可期，主席對於該公司頗致奬勉，後因主席亟欲他行，未及欵待，該公司深致歉忱。</p>

<h3 id="c166">提倡國貨的「知行合一」 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 許茸餘</p>
<p>「今年是國貨年、我們須要提倡國貨」。這樣的嚷了好多時候，他的功效是怎樣？海關的統計表上，洋貨的輸入，未見减少；各大公司的橱窗裏，陳列着大阪，巴黎，倫敦，紐約的貨樣，而且你爭我奪地購買着；摩登的仕女，他們是倡用洋貨的活廣告，竟是非洋貨不穿，非洋貨不用。我們的國貨年，成績是這樣的出乎例外，眞是笑煞外國人，氣死有心人了。我們也曾開過幾次的國貨展覽會和幾次的國貨大運動，這等於打一下强心針，眼前是奮興一下，過後仍是迷迷糊糊。難道我們中國人是這樣的冥頑不靈，甘心受人的經濟宰割麽？這我要想到先總理所提倡的「知行合一」說了。「知之而不行，等於不知」。「欲行而不知，變做瞎幹」。這有甚麽用呢？我們的提倡國貨，想不到也犯了這兩種弊病。</p>
<p>（一）知之而不行　這種人大都是智識階級和摩登仕女，他們明明知道這是洋貨：也明明知道用洋貨是有傷國家命脈的。可是我愛時髦，我貪美觀，國家和我有甚麽相關呢？而且他們還有這種心理：以爲你們用國貨好了，我一個人用洋貨，未必影響到國家，這種偏拘不通的成見，眞是國家的致命傷。因爲你可以用洋貨，我難道不好用洋貨？甚麽人是有用洋貨專利權的？這樣一來，國家還了得麽？况且這種人是時代的代表　　快快築堤士英</p>
<p>者，他們愛穿甚麽，愛用甚麽，窮鄉僻壤，自會起來效尤。「城中好高髻，四方高一尺」。國貨的不能提倡，竟是這般人爲之作梗。我們要提倡國貨，須要先制裁這般人。</p>
<p>怎樣制裁這般人呢？你要勸導他，他不是不懂。或者巧言善辦，說到國貨怎樣的窳陋；生產率怎樣的不夠，反而使勸的人啞口無言。我想「羞惡之心，人皆有之」。凡是愛用洋貨的人，言論界的人，口誅筆伐，啓發其良心；而社會中人，也不與之來往，以增其羞惡。對待這種「明知故犯」的人，竟然想不出其他的方法。</p>
<p>（二）欲行而不知　，凡稍有血氣稍有心肝的人，是無不愛購國貨的。可是市上洋貨充斥，非是專門家，實不能辨别其孰洋孰土。還有祗圖牟利，没有國家觀念的奸商，改頭換面，魚目混珠，偏拿劣貨冒充國貨。這竟使愛購國貨的人，氣力大不出；因此每年暗中枉送的金錢，又不知凡幾。不過這一種毛病，究竟比第一種來得輕鬆：醫治起來，也便當一些。</p>
<p>醫治的方法怎樣呢？（一）多多設立國貨公司。就拿上海一地來講，雖有市商會的國貨商塲；南京路的兩家國貨公司；西門的蓬萊市塲，實際上到底不夠。我以爲至少每條馬路上，須有一家國貨商店，規模小一些倒不要緊，祗要不攙雜贋鼎纔對。（二）發行國貨小册子。把各種日用的國貨，由各路商界聯合會或各地商會，印行一本小册子，所有商標，產地，功用，都一一詳細說明。這不但使愛用國貨的人，得了一隻南針；並且對於國貨的推廣，也盡了宣傳的方法，一定相當的功效。（三）嚴勵取締奸商的改頭換面。奸商要販賣劣貨，我們是無權禁止的。不過我們知道劣貨而不去購買，那已經使得他夠受的了。惟有他改換牌號，那無異設阱陷人。對於法律上道德上，都有嚴厲取締的必要。這層還須經官廳的援助，民衆是不能直接加以制裁的。</p>
<p>我說了這一篇的話。無非希望「知者能行，」「行者亦知，」對於國貨的前途，纔有一綫的希望。不過古人說的；「哀莫大於心死，身死次之。」凡知之而不行的人，差不多一半的心是死了，須要使他良心復活，纔肯愛用國貨。至於行而不知的人，那像害了一些傷風咳嗽，倒是無礙於國貨的前途。</p>

<p>夫：冠生園的月餅肉餃等等，都是狠好的國貨食品，而且價錢也不貴，不如去買幾盒送去吧？　妻：好好好···我們穿了國貨的衣服去拜壽，也應該拿國貨的食品去送禮。那才相稱哩。</p>

<h3 id="c168">參觀通成紡織廠記 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣維喬</p>
<p>夫物無棄材，在能利用，余參觀通成紡織廠，而始信此語爲不謬也。該廠設於京滬線戚墾堰：創辦至今，已有十年。係利用普通紗廠賸餘脚花，或廢絲廢毛之類，紡織成品，美麗異常：内分漂染揀花，回絲，彈花，淸花，和花，紡紗，搖紗，織物，準備，整理，打包，修理，物料各間，工作均循序而進，條理井然。其揀花，回絲，彈花，漂染四間，爲工作之初步；凡脚花舊絲綿及廢毛等，經漂染洗滌着色或經人工揀過，或經回絲車打碎，或經彈花機彈凈，則成上等原料，再經過淸和花機，即可紡紗織布。紡織二間，爲該廠主要工塲，計有粗細紡機各十四部，軍毯機二部；有格令室，試騐紗支輕重粗細及拉力大小；織機五十二部，有提花龍頭及自動梭箱，極爲新式。此外如準備，漂染，整理等間，機器亦佳。該廠設備，自建築以至機器，處處均科學化，廠房則用水門汀鐡筋，屋頂爲鋸齒式，光線充足，氣温適宜。至技術管理，尤極精密。廠内有規模完備之研究室；取各種原料及樣品，庋置陳列，爲研討之資料。管理則能利用科學方法，收事半功倍之效。廠之内外，遍植梧桐　柏</p>
<p>，到處濃綠成陰，身入其間，幾忘其爲工塲也。利用廢物之工塲，塵埃必</p>
<p>多、該廠均在機器上，装以白鐡管，以電扇扇入塵塔内，故其潔凈爲他廠</p>
<p>所不及也。　余尤喜其勞資之間，欵洽異常，工人約近千人，無不恊力同心，愛護工廠。每參觀各間，見識員則一律衣黃制服，往來指揮，精神飽满；工人則和顏悅色，工作緊張，對於廠長池宗墨君及副廠長方少和君工務處長章育文君等，有如家人子弟；故廠務之進行，如身之使臂，臂之使指，其功效乃在無形之間也。該廠出品大宗有花素厚絨布，花素絨毯，軍用毯，四支六支粗紗，絲綿紗，自强呢，春秋呢，廉潔布及藥水棉布等，種類繁多，均品質優良，色澤鮮艷，利用廢物，可謂神乎其技，堪與舶來品抗衡丨歷年參加各省展覽會，咸得最優等奬狀，客廳壁上，琳瑯满目，使可以證明其成績矣。韓愈曰：大木爲杗，細木爲桷，欂樝侏儒，椳闐扂楔，各得其宜；施以成室者，匠氏之工也；玉札丹砂，赤箭靑芝，牛溲馬勃，敗鼓之皮，俱收並蓄，待用無遺者，醫師之良也。該廠利用棉，毛，絲廢物製成優良物品，使利權不外溢，國貨能振興，亦猶匠氏之工，醫師之良，使各物均能適其用，誠可喜也！余來時適値該廠自流井淤泥，不能出水，其工務處人員，就運河装馬達，打水入廠西池中，設法濾淨，以鐡管通入，不日造成自來水、供全廠應用，於此可見其平日辦事之精神矣。竊意此等合理之工廠，全國誠不多見，倘有大資本家，爲之助力，俾擴大範圍，則前途發展，不可量也！至於勞工之福利，如花園，浴室，學校，醫院，圖書室，俱樂部等設備，余已另爲文以記之，茲不贅云。</p>

<p>自由談	希特拉與雍正帝  徐懋庸　　大家都說希特拉是個摧殘文化的暴君，但據他自已說來，却又是個風雅的人物。在某次宴會上，他對藝術界及電影界的名士脫尼，瓦耐克說：　　「在或種意味上，我是藝術家，倘若我不涉足政界，那麽一定會成就一個純粹的藝術家。」　　這話有幾分是不騙人的。讀他的傳記，知道他的幼年，實曾充满了做一個畫家的熱望，直到他在維也納的美術學校的入學試騐中落第以後，這纔把心力用到别方面去了。　　然而，這回的提起這樣的話，是有别的用意的，再看後文就可明白：　　「我主張用電影和無線電來宣傳主義，使全國國民及各國人民充分了解國社黨的精神。可」是我不贊成把政治宣傳藏在藝術的外衣下的那種辦法。政治是政治，藝術是藝術，應該各自生長發展的。然而，眞正原藝術家是一定會奔赴到我們的旗幟下面來的，爲什麽呢？因爲我們是建設的，而眞正的藝術家，也完全是建設的。所以純粹的藝術家，唯在我們所抱的思想中，能夠發見眞正的力量。」　　引爲同志，曲曲折折委委婉婉地說來，到底只是一句話：「你們投降我罷。」但多麽爲藝術留地步，爲藝術家留身分，眞有禮賢下士之風。單是這樣地看着，希特拉是並不怎樣橫暴的。　　其實這是希特拉一班人的傳統的手段之一：「硬功」以外的「軟功」。不過希特拉是暴君中之澈底者。他曾宣言「微温主義」是他的不共戴天之敵，我們總以爲他是一味硬做的，可是這回也使用起微温主義的軟功來了、足見軟功確乎是少不得的。　　淸朝的雍正帝，也不是一位仁君，在上海灘上流行着的劍俠小說裏，他的性格表現得尤其陰險殘酷，單是那件「維民所止」的文字獄，就足以證明他的不講道理了。然而，他曾做過比希特拉更其仁明的事情，就是對於曾靜事件的處置。曾靜受呂晚村的學說的影響，發爲恢復漢族的運動，慫恿岳鍾麒謀反，不成，被捕。雍正帝知呂晚村一派的學說盛行，甚爲驚駭，因急加辯疏，冀以殺反淸思想之勢力。於是將自已之辯疏與曾靜供詞，合而爲一，名曰「大義覺迷錄，」根據中國聖人的學說，解釋唯有德者可享帝位，初無華夷之别。對於呂晚村的學說，亦命儒臣詳細加以批評，而不予焚燬。他說：「朕今若焚燬彼等之書，使將來不見此」書，轉滋疑惑誤會，以爲得聖賢之眞傳，此固非朕之本意也。」曾靜，則不加誅戮，只是下令改逐了事。　　對於一個落第書生的供詞和一個已死的遺民的著作，也加以辯疏和批評，比起殺和燒來，實在麻煩得多了。然而倘非必要，雍正帝是一定不肯用這種麻煩的軟功的罷。關於翻譯  洛文　　因爲我的一篇短文，引出了穆木天先生的「從『爲翻譯辯護』談到樓譯『二十世」紀之歐洲文學』」（九日「自由談」所載），這在我，是很以爲榮幸的，並且覺得凡所指摘，也恐怕都是實在的錯誤。但我在那「爲翻譯辯護」中，所希望於批評家的，實在有三點：一，指出壞的：二，奬勵好的；三，倘没有，則較好的也可以。而穆木天先生所實做的是第一句。　　以後呢，可能有别的批評家來做其次的文章，想起來眞是一個大疑問。　　所以我要再來補充幾句：倘連較好的也没有，則指出壞的譯本之後，并且指明其中的那些地方還可以於讀者有益處。　　此後的譯作界，恐怕是還要退步下去的。姑不論民窮財盡，即看地面和人口，四省是給日本拿去了，一大塊在水淹，一大塊在旱，一大塊在打仗，只要略略一想，就知道讀者是減少了許許多。因爲銷路的少，出版界就要更投機，欺騙，而拿筆的也因此只好更投機，欺騙。即有不願欺騙的人，爲生計所壓迫，也總不免比較的粗製濫造，增出些先前所没有的缺點來。走過租界的住宅區鄰近的馬路，三間門面的水果店，晶瑩的玻璃窗裏是鮮紅的蘋果，通黃的香蕉，還有不知名的熱帶的果物。但略站一下就知道：這地方，中國人是很少進去的，買不起。我們大抵只好到同胞擺的水果攤去，化幾文錢買一個爛蘋果。　　蘋果一爛，比别的水果更不好喫，但是也有人買的，不過我們另外還有一種相反的脾氣：首飾要「足赤」，人物要「完人」。一有缺點，有時就全部都不要了。愛人身上生幾個瘡、固然不至於就請律師離婚，但對於作者、作品，譯品，却總歸比較的嚴緊，蕭伯納坐大船，不好；巴比塞不算第一個作家，也不好；譯者是「大學敎授，下職官員」，更不好。好的不出來，怎麽辦呢？我想，還是請批評家用喫爛蘋果的方法，來救一救急罷。　　我們先前的批評法，是說，這蘋果有爛疤了，要不得，一下子抛掉。然而買者的金錢有限，豈不是大寃枉，而况此後還要窮下去。所以，此後似乎最好還是添幾句，倘不是穿心爛，就說：這蘋果有爛疤了，然而這幾處没有爛，還可以喫得。這麽一辦，譯品的好壞是明白了，而讀者的損失也可以小一點。　　但這一類的批評，在中國還不大有，即以「自由談」所登的批評爲例，對於「二十世紀之歐洲文學」，就是專指爛疤的：記得先前有一篇批評鄒韜奮先生所編的「高爾基」的短文，除掉指出幾個缺點之外，也没有别的話。前者我没有看過，說不出另外可有什麽可取之處；但後者却曾經翻過一遍，覺得除批評者所指摘的缺點之外，另有許多記載作者的勇敢的奮鬥，吏胥的卑劣的陰謀，是很有益於靑年作家的，但也因爲有了爛疤，就被抛在筐子外面了。　　所以我又希望刻苦的批評家來做剜爛蘋果的工作，這正如「拾荒」一樣，是很幸苦的，但也必要，而且大家有益的。再談樓譯「二十世紀歐洲文學」  穆木天　　在九月九日「自由談」上，我指明了樓譯「二十世紀文學」中之繙譯的錯誤。在十二日的「自由談」上，樓先生發表了他那篇「並非答辯」。我的指正是要盡我所應盡的義務。但是樓先生不但不接收批評，反而想籠統地掩飾錯誤。因之，我再提出這個問題，同大家和樓先生商討一下。　　第一，樓先生說我「不審愼」。樓先生說：「例如穆先生說我Ｍａｘｉｍ　Ｄｕ　Ｋｓｂｎ」這譯名是杜撰的，不幸他也没註出不杜撰的原名，便硬派馬克森卡恩没有這個人，好似連原作者茀里采都在與我通同騙人。」怪哉！樓先生連我那篇文章都没有看懂。我並未說過法國没有Ｍｓｘｉｍｄｕ　Ｃａｍｐ（即馬克森·杜·卡恩·），而且說没有樓先生所註的那位Ｍｓｘｉｍｄｕ　Ｋａｂｎ。茀里采所講論的，是Ｍａｘｉｍｄｕ　Ｃａｍｐ，他並未「騙人」，樓先生所註的，是Ｍａｘｉｍ　ｄｕ　Ｋａｈｎ，法文學史上確是没有那個人，是誰「騙人」，問樓先生好啦。樓先生又說：「僅僅爲找固有名詞譯音的原文，關係卡恩，大槪是根據小說月報世界文學號（二十週年刋）的。」請樓先生把所根據的「小說月報」中的那篇文章找出來大家看看罷。如果是那篇文章中有「Ｍａｘｉｍ　ｄｕ　Ｋａｂｎ」，那應是該作者的錯誤，而算是樓先生上了一次當。樓先生譯書時查原文的話，儘可以查大部頭的文學史，和字典，那多少可以比樓先生到「小說月報」中去查，原名，是方便些，也是可靠些，不幸，在樓先生譯本一零六頁在「維特拉克」之下有「（Ｊ，Ｖｉｒｄｒａｃｋ）」這個原名，不知樓先生又從何處查來的？那顯然是ＣｈａｒｌｅｓＶｉｌｄｒａｃ，是「商船堅决號」（Ｌｅ　Ｐａｑｕｅｂｏｔ）Ｔｅｎａｃｉｙ）與「密茜·歐克賴」（Michel）Auclair）之作者，不但有，而且我還見過。是貨眞價實。可是，「J·Virdrack」却眞没有。請樓先生把「Ｊ·Ｖｉｒｄｒａｃｋ」的出處，指示出來。不然也是杜撰。我這樣指示出來　，爲的免去遺害讀者起見。　　第二，樓先生接着又說：「從這一點」想到穆先生的其他的原文對照，是否一一可靠，似乎也有問題」。我的對照，何處不可靠，請樓先生明白指示出來，好帮助我的學習。我的文中本附着日文，爲得使讀者一目瞭然。但是，大槪是因爲没有日文假名鉛字的原故，「自由談」的編者把日文原文給勾掉了。樓先生的這一個「似乎」，不知根據於何處？不可靠處，最好用實例一一地指明。但是樓先生的所謂「從這一點」的「這一點」，已一再地經我說明出來是不對的。那麽，「從這一點」再一想，那可越想越錯了。人家批評樓先生的錯誤，樓先生還不曉得自已是否錯誤，連檢查都不肯檢查，而只是隨便地說批評者，「是否一一可靠，似乎也有問題」，以安慰自已，給自已掩飾。這種態度從樓先生在他答文中所說的「爲着生活，又不能不勉强繼續那工作」是同樣的態度。如果一個人是忠實地致力於新文化運動的話，是不宜有此態度的。　　最後，我誠懇地向樓先生說：對於自已的過去的批判是必要的，那能帮助新的工作。前次我所指示出來的樓先生的許多繙譯上的錯誤，是希望樓先生能仔細地檢查該全書中的一切的錯誤。但，不幸地，樓先生說：「不幸的，我甚至連找出自已的譯書和原文的餘閑都没有，好在現在還有許多要做的新的工作。）不去檢查舊日的錯誤，或不接收正確的批評的話，是將越發錯誤起來的。决不能因爲有「新的工作」就掩飾自已的舊日的錯誤。若是這樣，那種新的工作，是大可令人担憂的。如果樓先生這樣地下去，就是什麽樣的批評者，都矯正不了樓先生的錯誤了。實在樓先生的錯誤是多得很呢。有暇，能再作文批評時，當把日文假名改成羅馬字，拉丁化一下，那就可排印給大家看啦。淺湖（四）  英國約瑟康拉德作侍桁譯　　「記得的，」那個白人說。那個馬來人突然站起來走進屋裏去。白人仍然靜坐在外面，可以聽見小屋裏面的聲音。阿薩特說：「聽我講！說話呀！」他的話語是補充着以完全的沈默。「啊，黛阿美倫！」他突然地呌着，在這呌嚷之後，是一次沈重的嘆息。阿薩特走出來又坐在他原來的地方。　　他們默默坐在火前。房裏没有一點聲音，在他們的身邊也没有一點聲音；但是在遠遠的湖上，他們可以聽見船夫們的聲音變調地明淅地嚮在寂靜的水上。在舢板的船頭的火熖，發着一片矇朧的紅光微弱地閃在遠方。陸地和水橫在黑暗裏，靜止而沈默。好像在這世界上，從那夜的黑暗的靜寂裏，什麽東西都没有遺留，只有那不斷地漠然地，繁星的閃爍。　　那個白人張大着眼睛直視着他面前的黑暗。這接近來的，不可避免的，眼看不見的死的恐佈與誘惑，死的靈感與神奇，鎭靜了他的民族所特有的焦灼，在他的思想中招起那最漠糊的最深奥的部份。那總是存在着的災難的豫感，那潛藏在人心間蝕苦着的預感，流入他周圍的寂靜裏丨丨那深沉而唖然的寂靜裏，使這寂靜像一副兇暴的可惡的假面具似地，令人不信任而厭惡。在他的生命的轉瞬間的有力的煩擾中，那包裏在星光的平靜中的大地，變成一塊非人性的陰影的國度，變成可怕而魅人的幽靈的戰塲，尊嚴的幽靈或卑鄙的幽靈，爲領有我們的絕望的心而熱烈地鬥爭着。這是一塊不可消滅的慾望與恐怖的不安而神秘的國度。　　一種悲慟的囁嚅起在暗夜裏；這囁嚅是憂鬰而驚人的，就好像那周圍的樹林的靜默想要把他們超然的不關心的知慧輸進他的耳裏似地。猶豫的漠然的聲音，漂浮在他身邊的空氣中，自然地漸漸形成話語；最後，靜靜地流成温柔而單調的語句的連續的囁嚅。他像一個剛醒轉來的人似地動了動，微微變了變他的位置。阿薩特，呆然而陰鬰地曲着身子坐在星下，以一種低低地幻夢的調子說：　　「··除掉在朋友的心裏，我們還向那里放下我們的煩惱的重荷呢？一個男人必需谈說着」戰爭和戀愛的事。你，屠安，曉得戰爭是怎麽回事，而且你也曾看見我在那變亂的時代，追求着死像旁人追求着生命一樣！寫作的東西也許會失掉的；虚僞的事也許會寫出來的；但眼睛所見的是眞實的、而且將永久地遺留在心裏！」　　「我記得的，」那個白人靜靜地說。阿薩特露出悲鬰而泰然的神氣繼續着講：</p>

<p>春秋	婦女與瓶  曕廬　　姑認觀音大士是女性，觀音大士有凈瓶，這個瓶是很靈異的；岳武穆的小姐，抱着銀瓶跳井，世稱銀瓶小姐，明朝宫中有古剌水瓶。婦人飲此水，香沁骨肉，這是過去時代的婦女與瓶。　　現在一般摩登化簡稱摩化的女菩薩，大抵對於香水瓶最有感情；其他油瓶，醋瓶，雖是日用的必需品，但不肯提在手中，被人家嘲笑這是小人家的女人，自已拾着瓶兒去舀油舀醋油舀酒。而且，三瓶之中，最忌的是油瓶，醋瓶；如果，拎了油瓶，人家往往嘲笑道：「這個油瓶爲什麽不拖着走呢？」如果、拾了醋瓶，人家又說：「留心些，不」要打碎了。」拖油瓶是說再醮婦帶了子女去嫁人；打碎醋瓶，是說婦女吃醋爭風；所以，摩化女菩薩的手中，絕對不肯提着油瓶和醋瓶。　　洒瓶，是娘姨大姐上街替主人酋酒所用的東西，摩化女菩薩當然也不肯提着走的。但是，逢着新造軍艦行下水禮，摩化女菩薩手中的香檳酒，非但，要和油瓶般的拖着，而且，要和醋瓶般的打碎它，頂刮刮擲瓶典禮，榮耀的了不得，這是一椿不可思議的事。　　在這崇拜歐化的時代，西洋婦女行擲瓶禮，摩化女菩薩道：「善哉善哉，我也來行一個擲瓶」禮。」假使，外國軍艦行下水禮，不是擲破香檳酒瓶，卻是請婦女們拖着油瓶繞塲三匝，或者，撲碎一個酸醋瓶，弄得全塲中酸氣冲天。吾知摩化女菩薩，便不忌什麽拖油瓶和打翻醋瓶了。伊們要說：「善哉善哉，我也未行個拖油瓶禮，和打碎醋瓶禮。」暴風雨的回憶  烟橋　　這回至上海，暴風雨的來襲，居然躬逢其盛。在旅邸中枯坐，聽到汽車的輪子，在水中街中輾過，颼颼瑟瑟的水聲，宛似在蘇州水閣，聽汽艇急駛。那些喫飽了飯没有事做的勞工們，過那游泳癮，没有嗟嘆，只有譁笑。我猜不出他們是什麽心理？或者他們也在和我同樣地起了詩的廻憶。我有什麽廻憶。想到老杜的「老屋爲秋風所破歌」，只有風，已夠使人怨悱着痛苦，無力抵抗，現在又添着雨，不僅是雨，還有潮。江北棚子和比老樹更衰頽的住家，要怎樣的咒詛着老天呢。我又想到競雄女士的。秋雨秋風愁煞人，伊在專制的淸末，感到政治的黑暗，覺得人知常在秋雨秋風之中，分明是借物寄慨，現在的共*和的中國。怎樣恐怕還不是秋雨秋風所能比喻罷。　　「霓虹」依舊燦爛着，『爵士音樂』依舊繁急着，上海的表面，雖是給暴風雨侵略得愁慘慘地，骨子裏還是狂歡縱慾，人的社會，本來是各有各的組織，不組聯繫的。寗波朋友所謂『阿拉弗關』是也。　　但棉花，稻花，都給暴風雨吹壞了，竹離斷，茅屋倒，漏濕了席，睡不得，浸透了些，燒不得，這光景只消離開都市中心數里之遙，就可以見到。或者聴明的士女們，也聯想得到。再說得近些，夜夜提高了嗓子，恨不得扯住了人們的耳朶而唱的。『生活之歌』！『夜報剛剛出版』！『五香茶葉蛋』！『楊延輝···』現在也寂然了。　　不是我挖苦，或者有許多士女們，也在咒詛，咒詛着老天可惡，『這樣的暴風雨中怎樣到高橋去呢。』壽山會  春雨樓主　　壽山會這個名稱很是奇特，差不多從我們湖州四安這個小小鎭上創造出來的，現在學榜樣去組織的人很多，組織壽山會，好像和現代的法西斯蒂運動一樣的風行，一樣的受到大衆的歡迎。　　壽山會的創設是十個人合成一個小組團體，家中須有年邁父母，或有賢助的嬌妻，幾有入會的資格，集合有一年四次的，或一年兩次，最少的僅有一次。每一個會員集合一次，須拿出會費十元或二十元，把這整整的一筆欵子，拿到棺材店裏去，請棺材店裏的老闆定做一口雙料的棺材，期待死神的來臨！死神一到，可以立刻睏到一口好好棺材。　　農村崩潰的呼聲，好似無線電波的傳播，我們這鎭落上，什麽也賴着農人，*假使是秋穀豐登的話，什麽都呈活躍的氣象。不然，像現在商業是寥落不堪，工業手上没生活做，農人是愁了臉望秋收豐稔，萬象是和死的一般。　但是啊！棺材店却没有空呢。　　一個人總究要死的，所以預備一個棺材，人人都聽得入耳，尤其是替父母先要備，掠一個孝子的美名，値得人家的稱頌。但是，又恐怕人指摘他在咒詛他父母早死。希望父母早死，是要負一個忤逆不孝的大罪名的，所以巧立一個壽山會的名目，就是表明「壽比南山」一樣長的意思。想必不久都市的人們也會學樣的，因爲拿出會費的時期，更有一席豐潤酒菜可吃，旣快朶頣，又得孝子的美名，又何樂而不做呢。情塲速寫  任培初　　他倆雖然只有幾天功夫的認識，但他們的愛情極度，却已達到火山爆裂的程度了。　　妹妹，我愛你，你好比是水，我好比是魚，我没有你，便没有了生命。妹妹，我非你不娶。　　哥哥，我愛你，你好比是電流，我好比是電泡，我没有你，便永遠没有光明　　哥哥，我非你不嫁。又隔了幾天功夫；　　妹妹，今天客人很多，你應酬得太乏了吧？　　哥哥，今天是我們一世最快樂的日子，所以，惟其竭力，才有趣。對呀！妹妹。我非但乏力，而且幸苦。所以非但有趣，而且開心。　　蜜月過了。他倆之間，漸漸起了變化。終於：　　喂，你要知道，這裏是舞塲，你一個已經結婚的婦人，不該背了丈夫，私自到這裏來和男子們摟着跳着。　　嚇，你太專制了，難道只許你自已背了我，私自到這裏來和女子們摟着跳着嗎？　　不，我是來偵探你的！　　那末，我也是來偵探你的！　　哼！　　哼！　　再隔幾天，那　的已和另一個女的：　　妹妹！我愛你，你好比是水，我好比是魚，我没有你，便没有了生命，妹妹，我非你不娶。　　那女的已和另一個男的：　　哥哥，我愛你，你好比是電流，我好比是電泡，我没有你，便永遠没有光明。哥哥我非你不嫁。東北四連  張恨水　　第十五回　客人含羞柔情蕩微笑　　　　　　　人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷　　他就微笑道：你說没有什麽問題了，這話也許太樂觀吧？人家姑娘的心事，我們還不在知道呢？我雖是個老腐敗，可是我就這樣的想，婚姻大事，總得男女兩方的當事人同意，到了後來，才能合作。那父母作主的婚姻，究嫌不大妥當。趙处强用手摸摸頭，又用手摸摸臉，現出那躊躇满志的樣子來，這，就微笑道：那實在没有什麽關係。趙翁正着顏色望了他道：什麽，没有什麽關係。這孩子說話眞不知道輕重。趙自强笑着點點頭道：眞的没有什麽關係，並不是我信口胡說的。趙翁道：不是胡說的，你有什麽把握，能說這一句没有關係的話呢。趙自强只是笑着却不肯說。趙翁道；你這孩子眞是不知輕重。我爲你這頭親事，也不知道操了多少心。到現在，你倒說種風凉話給我聽。趙自强才笑道：這個我還有什麽不明白的，我能夠在你老人家面前說風凉話嗎？因爲他···他說到這裏，不肯向下說，自已笑了起來了。趙翁瞪了眼睛望着道：他怎麽了？趙自强笑道；我們今天已經見過面的。據他談話的那種情形看起來，倒不是，不怎麽。他自已說到這裏，也覺得有些費解了，便又笑着註疏了一句道：那樣了，大槪也是很好的。趙翁也不由得顫動着鬍子，笑了起來。便道：你倒和他談過話了。這年頭兒。說着手摸了鬍杪不住的撚着，也就不住的微笑。那是不用說，其辭若有憾焉，其實乃深喜之。趙自强便笑道：全是小田這孩子胡閙，說是要我去吃元宵。結果是他讓黃小姐把他也拉去了。他們這種計劃，好像是預先定好，騙了他去的，他也像我一樣事先一點也不知道。（一八六）　　火雪山徵求舊稿　　　痢老八，賭鬼阿順，（刋十九年申報自由談）。血的跳舞，隔膜（題或有異），刋民國日報覺悟。跛子阿根，（刋民國日報閒話）魔鬼（譯文）存民國日報覺悟編輯部，未發表。上海小姐橫面，遺失。倘有藏存上項副刋或拙稿者，請借予一抄，或通函或派人來抄。需酬若干，無不應命。通訉處上海城隍廟中廳。小食譜菱芡雜談  朱　　一連幾陣秋風秋雨，老少年的　見，已紅得勝過了二月中的濃桃艷杏。那鳳仙的夜晚的花兒，更開得五色繽紛，璀璨動目，装點出籬畔一派秋色！是的，秋已降臨大地了。蟲兒喞着秋聲，菱和芡也代了那苦心的蓮子，上市了，供人們的大嚼，做秋季裏一種應時的食物。　　（菱）　蘇州出產的菱，大約可分七種，除夏季的紅菱，和歲尾年頭，供薦神佛的烏菱，不能算秋季的應時食品外；秋季的菱兒，約有五種。　　（沙菱角）這種菱兒，上市最早，個兒最小，可是却有四隻尖銳的角兒；所以吃起來，常常有觸嘴之痛。蘇洲人有句俗話，呌做「荷葉包沙角菱，」意思是說這件事兒，是永遠包庇不下的，像尖銳的菱角，一下早把荷葉刺破的一般。這種菱生食旣嫩，煮熟了吃起來，也很甜美可口。　　圓角菱　　那菱兒的體積，也和沙角菱一般；不過那四隻角，已像飽經世故的人物，一般的圓滑，一般的光緻。這種菱，性兒旣糯，又無刺手危險，於是一般兒童，就當做秋季食品中的無上恩物。　　和尙菱　　這菱兒的圓滑程度，更勝過圓角菱，光緻緻的，幾乎再找不出一些稜角。他的體積，大約有芋奶大小。肉是厚的，殼是薄的，不過味見却很生硬。有人說湼槃和光的和尙，憑你圓滑，總是個茹素的草包，缺乏膩膩的脂肪油味。這句譬語，滑稽是滑稽了，終熑侮辱道高德劭的長老們。　　小白菱　　小白菱雖也有餛飩菱的模樣，但究竟角兒太光，皮兒太厚，肉見太硬，除少數人嘗嘗外、究竟是不受人們歡迎的。　　菱，大都是生在菱蕩中的，小小的葉，靑葱葱的浮在水面上，往往一碧數里。葑溪門外，菱蕩就在在皆有，柔波耀眸翠葉浮空，當夕陽的餘睴，在水面上鍍上了一層碎金，那一隻隻採菱的小桶，就浮漾在這綠蔭深處。我小時候，曾見過不少關於採菱的民間歌曲，香艷旖旎，别有風味，可惜現在已大都健忘，不能錄在這裏了。　　（芡）芡實，蘇州呌做「雞頭。」它的形狀，好像一朶荷花的菡蓞，也是浮在水中的。芡實採取之後，把外皮剝去，裏面就是粒粒像琥珀色彩的唸珠了。這種硬殼剝去之後，裏面才是圓潤光緻的一顆肉兒。我記得那位風流帝子唐明皇，在欣賞撫摩楊家玉環兩個乳頭之後，曾發出這麽一句讚美詩，呌做「新剝雞頭肉。」新剝芡實圓潤光滑，煮熟後，更是光彩動　人，並且滋養極富，還是一種强身的滋補品呢。莫怪唐天子要借來做譬喻了。　　芡實整個的粒粒煮食，果然淸香可口，咀嚼有味；然而齒牙搖落的人們，吃起來，却就不易咀嚼了。於是又有一個食法；將鮮芡實搗爛成漿，加以等量的水和糖，在文火上煮食，在漿質沸熟的當兒，把匙兒且煮且擾，一霎時，就煮成褐色的芡實粥，肥美香甜，老年人吃了，固然滋補萬分，就是普通人吃了，也香生齒頰呢。　　芡實和菱殼，矖乾之後，都可當作燃料，那也是種廢物利用呢。</p>

<p>談言文學是神聖的藝術　　史斌　　了解文學意味的人們，一定讚同我「文學是神聖的藝術」這一句話的。但是單獨標揭這句話，有些人一定很覺迷練恍惚的；因此我便略略地寫一些出來，以表示我個人的意見：　　我以爲文學和空氣一樣的彌漫在世上，又它的力量，和造物者的上天同一的偉大呢？我們試看世界上熙熙攘攘的人們，那一個可以不與文字有關係？文字雖然不能說完全是文學所專有的工具，可是尋根究底起來，文字便是文學的附屬物，不論那一種科學和意志的一切宣傳，都要仗仰着文字的。那末可以說世上一切表示在文字上的，莫不隸屬於文學的旗幟之下的。文字的用處，雖各有不同，而它的精神，却完全寄在文學中的啊！綜之，世上要是没有文學，文字便不能永久存在，其餘的科學等等，也就失了憑藉了！　　人們從幼少到長大，他的智識和學問，全仗着文字啟發他的；你想孩子們入學，讀書爲了什麽呢？不是希望識字嗎？其中後來確然能夠走到文學的一途上去的，雖不過十之一二，其餘的大抵支配在别種的生活裏，絕對和文學没有關係；可是文學的起點，便是文字，「字」便是文學的胎生者；人們識字之始，早就被文學的力量侵入了！正不必論他，　後的趨向，是不是屬於文學的哩？　　現在物質的狂燄，高到幾千丈了！大家都拿資本的燃料去助着它；那物質的產生者，便是科學；凡自命頭腦新穎的人，没一個不奔逐於科學的焦點上；；因此文學便漸漸的衰落下來，幾乎成爲一件極無聊的東西，人們對於文學的旨趣，千百人中不過十數人領會着；有了這種原因，文學的勢力，又那得不一天一天的降落呢？不知道科學是完全以物質爲目的，並不能與人以積極的慰藉的，不過是粉飾在外表罷了！只有文學獨能于精神界燃着光明之燈，引導人們入於安藉的大道上，消除一切煩惱和愁苦的障礙，使人們得到眞實的人生的意味。古語云：「文以載道一，中庸曰：」道也者，不可須叟離也。」所謂「道」便是文學的眞精神。人類的生活，處處都仗着「道」來維護的。開㧞費　水芽　　父親抬着頭，呆着眼，望天上的雲變，　　「爸爸！我們學校是九月一日開學。」　　「唔！」　　　「要五十塊錢纔行呢！」　　「唔！」父親眼望着他一下，又回復到原來的位置，突然地，眼呆住他臉上。　　「别去了吧！下半年再去；唉！稻大熟不値錢，有了災又没有錢，那裏有這筆大欵子年年送到學堂裏栽培你，······」　　「爸爸在家也要吃飯的，這錢大半化在膳食上的啊！」　　「你這樣不明白，在家就不整整拿出大欵來，你想這大數目那裏去想法？在家至少也能帮助我··」　　「明年就畢業了！爸！」　　　「畢業？」什麽畢業不畢業？畢了業又怎樣？三麻子的兒子。可算畢業了，還不是在家吃了一年多老米飯，今年春纔弄在橋下小學堂敎書，十來塊一月，雖然比老子種地强，可是又欠薪的，吃飽了一個，養不活一家，債仍還不了，三麻子這幾年來弄得氣都喘不過來了；節上人家要債，不能還躱在咱們家裏訴苦嗎？這你也瞧見的。畢業？你畢業了又怎樣？」　　父親縐着眉，眼睛又注在河岸上的田裏。　　　「唉！學校已上了多天課了，再晚功課趕不上，」　　第二天在田裏回來後，父親從腰包裏拿出一包，遞給他說：「這裏凑到五十塊錢，到了學校用得省些！你要知道這錢是···」父親咽住了，眼睛包着淚水，頭歪望着蛙的跳，　　下午他提着小籐包，跟着獨輪車，走到學堂裏，把開拔費換了一張聽講證，讀書。　　他知道開拔費是河南三進瓦屋裏賈三爺的印子錢。桃色的絕交信　賢　　今天偶然整理衣箱，在夾袍中落出一個粉紅色的信封。那件夾袍放在箱已有三四年了，我記不起這信封所以珍藏的緣故，裏面潔白的素箋，已變成淡黃色，我先瞧了信尾的署名，自已不免笑了起來，這是我初戀的紀念品，是我表姊的一封絕交書。畢業後，儘在失業　中　　。這類羅曼斯的故事，早已像我童心一般的一去不復返了。這一頁桃色的絕交書，重給了我一個甜蜜的回憶？　　我和表姊的初戀，和一切表姊表弟間的戀愛一樣普通。因爲我們兄弟三人中，母親最不喜歡的是我，舅父怡和母親相反，所以我小時候是常住在舅父家中的。所謂不姊，當然是舅父的女兒了，我們靑梅竹馬，兩小無猜，舅父從不來干涉我們的游戲，我們由孩子時代的「要好」走上戀愛的途徑。當初在我們的心理，夫妻兩字的範圍，認爲我們「要好」，就是夫妻了。孩子時代的戀愛，大槪是最純潔的戀愛了。　　我們由小學而高等（就是現在的高）級）都在一個學校讀書的，升中學也一同到上海來，不過舅父指定我要進的中學不是男女同學，這時候我們已到相當年齡，知道戀愛在表面上要虚僞的，表姊不能逼着父親要進一個男女同學，而我倆的誤會却因此而發生。　　我們晤面的機會，惟有盼望星期日了，但是我們知道虚僞，不好意思在傳達處寫着表哥表妹的親屬關係，到各人校裏相訪，我們晤面的方法，早一天寫信約在某處等候。　　是一個春天，我們約在半淞園，我在河心亭獨自坐着，遇見了鄉下來滬的親戚，他們以長輩的口吻，問了我許多關於學校裏的情形，最後要我陪着他到處游玩。我一時不能說我在等候我的表姊。免强隨着走，繞了半個圏子，我一定再到河心亭走過，冀望遇見表姊的時候打個招呼，當我第三次走過時，被人蒙住了我的眼睛，回頭正是表姊，我忙以嘴示意、因爲這親戚不認識我的表姊，在他們長者的口吻中遇見了這類事不知要如何大驚小怪。果然，他們回鄉下告訴我母親，我在上海治游不規，母親認爲舅父特别喜歡我是有意和她反對，就以傳來的蜚言加培告訴舅父，半淞園的事一變而爲涉足花叢。這暑假我被舅父大加訓斥，我雖竭力剖白，但不見」空穴來風」輕輕定了我罪名。　　表姊認爲也是事實，秋季開學，她先我二天到上海，這一頁桃色的絕交書，我到學校時，早已送到傳達處，我也曾長長的寫過剖白的信，終於是喜劇變爲悲劇。　　這一頁素箋永遠珍藏在我的夾袍中　　如今表姊是綠葉成蔭子满枝，我也將要做孩子的爸爸了。最近和舅父談起，他歸諸命運說一句你有没有因緣！　　我瞧過後，仍將這淡黃色的紀念品珍藏在夾袍中，希望牠變成暗黃色的時候，再給我一次甜蜜的回憶。</p>

<p>現代名人書畫　　楊九峯先生畫（略歷）　　楊九峯先生原名啟瑞字輯五厓門西岸人嗜書畫所作多古體化幅其他近作也（賊會做詩）的故事　唐濟民　　暑氣全消，金風送冷，夕陽西下，暮鳥還林，這時，詼諧百出的張老伯，聚了三四個兒童，圍坐在屋外草地上，大講其故事，我也得參與聽，聽到好處，不禁呌絕，幾日煩惱，消於一霎，怪不得幾個兒童天天拗着張老伯講故事啦，昨天，他講的一段笑話，是（賊會做詩）極纔興趣，而且帶着些譏笑性質，綠之以實本刋，當亦爲讀者所樂聞歟，以下是張老伯的談話。　　一天夜已深了，一位樑上君子，居然降臨到一位門館先生的家裏，先生是個窮秀才，書獃子，家徒四壁，除掉書架上幾本破書以外，可稱别無長物，但是，那個满懷希望的賊，竟開始他的發掘工作了，剛挖得正起勁的當兒，驚動了裏面一位道學先生，他眞是書獃子，非但不呌捉賊，並且大吟他的詩句起來那詩是「貝戎（貝戎拚成賊字）何事掘柴扉，書館之中不値幾，架上藏書千萬卷，偷回那可去充飢，」書聲朗朗的吚晤起來，不料這個所謂貝戎竟是文明之至，非但不逃跑，而且對吟起來，他吟的是「聞得君家富有餘，今宵特地到尊居，旣云書館無他物，收拾絲竿别釣魚「，先生裏面聽了不覺大驚呼曰「君旣有斯才，何必定爲此道」賊對曰「我爲因脫館，（門館先生被人辭歇或因故停職皆曰脫館）故此權作生涯」先生失色歎曰，我今日不料爲貝戎所揶揄矣，店員通訊　　經界交涉編者先生：　　　一向佩服貴欄的我，現在遇到一件自已不能解决的問題，祗好寫了這封信，請你指示。先生一視同仁，諒來不致於見拒罷！此外，因爲這件事，業已發生糾紛，還得請你從速賜答。　　余於前年價買房屋一所，與西省首某甲房屋，是合帖的。去年余將毘連甲屋之一間拆除，因帖與壁均屬共有，爲顧全鄰誼計，未曾拆除。當時甲因輩壁與屋頂連接處所，易於滲水，要求留出梁木數寸，並准其架設屋瓦：余曾口頭允諾至今余爲杜絕日後糾紛計，自願犠牲共有之帖壁，於帖壁之外，砌一高墻。及至砌至甲屋屋面，該墻與甲去年所架之屋面相拚：而問題生矣。甲於此時，出而干涉，阻止砌墻：聲言非將他去年所做新屋面的地位讓出不可。余以爲兩姓房屋，互相合帖，載明契紙，余自已情願將共帖壁犠牲，吃虧已屬不小。若再讓出數寸，以全屋進深爲三十八尺計算，不將吃虧地面二十方尺以上嗎？這未免吃甗太大，因與力爭。如此各執一詞，不知究屬誰的主張爲合法？余能否以「妨害人行使權利」控某甲？要求收回主權，將甲去年所做的屋面拆去？　　方琛建謹上　　編者按：兩姓不動產的中間，應當要有分明的界址，絕對要避免互相牽連的地方。但是有的時候，兩姓的房屋，大槪因爲先前屬於一姓的緣故，就會有「合帖」的事實發現。在這種情形之下，最好在改造的時候，各立柱帖，免得經界不淸。通常皆慣，因爲「咸工不毁」的緣故，總是先動工者吃虧。萬一一方面拆除後，並不建築，那麽不拆除的一方，因爲單壁不如厚墻的堅實，在上部易於滲水，可以要求臨時留出梁木一二尺，架設屋面。這呌做抛大步，俗稱抛發；是一種臨時設備，日後一方建築時，仍須讓出。所以你們雙方過去的辦法，完全是依照習慣的合法行爲。你現在即在共有之帖壁外砌墻，要求將甲去年所做的屋面拆除，也是一種正當的辦法。甲的阻撓，完全是無理取閙，至萬不得已時，你可以申請法院救助。除了法律的觀點以外，我們再以建築學來講罷。我們都知道房屋的墻壁，以兩面通風乾燥爲保管的第一條件。現在硬要在墻與屋的中間，留出寬不及尺的狹弄，定做一個積水的所在，有什麽可取呢。　　某君，年念歲，江蘇人，中學程度，，曾在任染織廠職員兼收賬員，某大牙刷廠跑街等職，熱悉本埠途逕，現願就任何公司店號職員，營業員，收賬員等職，有妥保，通訊處，本埠貝勒路恒慶里四街四十七號俞堯章君轉。　　一民君　年二十七歲，大學畢業。願任本外埠各高中數理化敎員　　　工作，亦頗有經騐，現聘任本埠中學數理化敎員，或工廠化騐員，通訊處，浦　路永利坊十七號謝君轉。　　　胡君，年二十五歲，現肄業於本埠某音樂學校，擅長西洋音樂，專敎聲樂與鋼琴，願任家庭或學校音樂敎師，通訊處本報業餘周刋轉。　　陳德生君，上海人，年四十歲，略識文字，熟悉全滬路徑，有殷實舖保，願任出店及其他勤勞職務，薪資不計，通信處法租界薩坡賽路，豐裕里七十九號，陳心剛轉。　　謝君，年二十六歲，安慶人，擅長中文，尤工小楷，現願就各機關團體，公司律師事務所等處職務，或家庭私墊敎授，薪金不計，通訊處法租界薩坡賽路，豐裕里三十六號，徐　勳君轉。　　某君，浙江人，　　　　歲，師範畢業，歷充政·商·學　　　界各職，工　算，尤擅長文　　　　社會長篇小　，現願充個人秘書，或公司團體之文書員，兼職亦可，通訊處北浙江路一七　八號文林書社康君收轉。　　某君，粵人，年三十歲，大學文科畢業，留澳學生，曾任機關職員，並在敎育界供職多年，精中英文學，現願任翻譯員，或公館敎授，如有意延聘者，請通函本報業餘周刋轉。　　沈CS女士，上海人，年二十一，曾肄業某專門學校，對于國文及法律智識，俱有根底，茲願就機關，或名律師事務所襄助等職，薪金不計，如有需要此等人物者，請投函本報業餘週刋轉。戲劇　　戰爭與和平（二）（四幕劇）凌鶴　　第二幕　逃亡之羣　　軍官：謝謝。好幾天不見了。你爲什麽一個人坐在這兒？我說怎麽不見二小姐在那邊哪。（小姐乙不睬她。間或作苦笑。）　　軍官：二小姐在想什麽心事嗎？什麽事不如意？　　小姐乙：没有什麽，我想一個人在這兒坐一會兒。　　夫人：昨天晚上我做了一個不吉利的夢，現在想起來還覺得可怕。不知怎麽的，我的珍珠項圏忽然掉了一粒，我想這怎麽得了呢，於是我一個人關起房門來到處找，因爲怕給用人知道了偷偷的拾去。可是到處都找遍了，箱夾裏，床底下，浴缸旁邊，找了又找，那兒都没有。那時心裏眞是急　，眼淚也流出來了。忽然聽說日本兵已經過來了，并且在我們屋外面放火。哎喲，這怎麽好呢？一粒珍珠又找不着，現在又非逃不可，這怎麽得了。回頭想，還是走罷，一粒珍珠找不着也是没辦法的事。於是我便將我的一些首飾全收拾好。這些東西是無論如何也得帶走的，不然我也就用不着逃了。收拾好了，走到露台上一看，四方都是火光，那時我眞大胆，不管三七二十一，便從上面跳下去。但是這一跳却奇怪極了，老是脚不着地，騰雲駕霧似的，老是在空中浮。可是心裏這樣的一急，却跌了下來。跌在那兒呢？跌在日本兵手裏。於是好些靑面獠牙的日本兵按住我，脫去了我的衣裳，更將我的首飾全拿去了。我想這怎麽得了？什麽都可以，可是搶我的東西却最傷心，於是我便大呌大跳，醒了。醒轉來一身冷汗。幸而這還是一個夢，假如眞的這樣那怎麽辦呢？所以我就打定主意馬上到天津去。可是偏是不開車。我眞急，你看，少不了還要給日本追上了的。　　小姐甲：（聽着科長夫人說了一段夢話，不自由的忘記了她的怨恨。）天哪，你眞的做了這樣的夢嗎？多麽可怕呀，若是我簡直要嚇得害病了。　。軍官：（靜默了一會兒之後，很憂悒走到小姐面前掏出那張照片。）二小姐！我想你一定認得的，這個照片是誰？　　小姐乙：對不起，我不認識。　　軍官：爲什麽會不認識？你不是整天和你姊姊在一道嗎？　　小姐乙：啊！是姐姐的朋友嗎？那是我更不會認識，她的男朋友多着哩。你問她自已去好了。姐姐，你來看，姐夫問你這個照片是誰。　　小姐甲：什麽？（快步的過來。）你又偷我的東西啦。　　軍官：我並没有偷，你剛才掉在地下的，我給你拾起來。　。　小姐甲：（從軍官手裏搶過照片。）你管他是誰？這也要你間嗎？這是我女朋友的朋友，我是從朋友那兒拿來玩兒的。哼，我不說你都罷，你到反而懷疑起我來了。　　軍官：要誰眞的懷疑你，我不過是隨便問問罷了。　　小姐甲：那末你爲什麽不大大方方的問我，要鬼鬼祟祟的向妹妹打聽呢？　　少爺：（走過這邊來）你瞧·你們眞是小孩子，什麽事又閙起來了？我看我們不管他罷。無論如何總得開車的。我們這樣白焦急也是没有用。（他隨手撳鈴。）李媽，你把那留聲機開起來，我們還是來跳一會兒舞罷。（一個堂倌在門口現面。）喂！再來幾瓶香檳。管他媽的，跳一個痛快，喝一個痛快。</p>

<p>電影專刊投身影界今昔難易之分（下）  安德　　現在可是不同了，影界裏有各式各樣的人物。男明星當中，從華雷斯皮萊的醜陋，到雷門諾代諾的風流瀟洒；從克拉克蓋博的粗魯，到法蘭蕭通的柔媚，其中還有如佐衣勃郎，詹姆士凱格南，等等形形式式的人，同樣地享着盛名，支着大薪俸，這不是現在的界限没有從前那樣的嚴了嗎？女明星的範圍，尤其不用說了。　　有聲電影的盛行，又給與了電影從業者更多的機會。在默片時代一個新進的演員，站到水銀燈下，幾乎茫然無所措其手足。他除掉需要表演的天才之外，還要能體會和倣效已成的動作的規律。這是一件很不容易的事。自從有聲電影出現之後，幾乎凡有嗓子的人，都可以在鏡頭前面說幾句話，唱一曲歌。表演的藝術雖然退化了，但取材的範圍，却是擴大了許多。雖然默片時代的明星，因爲喉嚨的關係，受淘汰的很多，但在另一方面，却替一般能開口說話唱歌的人，大開了方便之門。　　這方便之門的大開，一般技術專家也出力不少，所以一般現在新進的人才，還要謝謝那些專家帮了他們不少的忙。第一種專家，就是攝影專家。舊日的攝影術，拒絕了許多希望進影界的人。他們從肉眼看來，是美麗俊俏的，但是一上鏡頭，就不成樣子了。近年以來，攝影的道具逐漸改良，攝影的藝術亦日日進步，再加以化妝法的精妙，幾乎無論何等樣的人，都可以上鏡頭了。　　第二種技術專家，於現代的電影有極大貢獻的，要算是收音師了。在一九二九年，有聲片蓬蓬勃勃興起的時候，收音的困難，非但使新進的人才裹足不前，就是一般舊日的明星，亦都望而怯走。那時收音機的不完備，祗有某一種人的聲音可以收，其餘的都因不相宜而被拒絕了。就是舞臺上第一流名角，如鮑琳弗德立克等，都在被摒棄之列。但是今日機械的進化，收音可能的範圍亦擴大了。從前許多的人聲音，不適宜於收音機的，現在亦可以收了。并且音弱的可以放大，響的可以縮小，尖銳的可以加重，低調的可以提高。他們有各種方法使全片的音調和諧，不致一個人聲如洪鐘，一個音細如蚊。　　當然，自從有聲片盛行之後，攝影和收音的技術進步了，攝影取材的範圍亦大了，而科學片，恐怖片，蠻荒片等的可能性亦增加了，於是除了各式各樣的男女演員之外，一切動植礦物亦多有了入鏡頭的機會。這不都是與今昔難易有關係的嗎？（完）影片談評評「可憐的曼麗」“Ｍｉｄｉｇｈｔ　Ｍａｒｙ”大光明  凌鶴　　一般的美國片，常是在外形上故弄玄虚，弄得觀衆迷離恍惚的。這一影片也是如此。僅就其分幕的花樣而言，Ｆａｄｅ　ｉｎ　Ｆｓｄｅ　ｏｕｒ固然仍是必要的使用可是那分塲的方法，却廢棄了「絞出」或是「劃過「，而是將「搖鏡頭」的方法就原來的塲面移換至另一塲面。這在不常接近電影的人們是不大看得懂的，不過在作者一定是很得意的，因爲又來了一個新的花樣。當然，這正是美國電影的特徵。　　導演除了這一點以外同時還有其他顯出小聰明之處。譬如特寫那一排書上的年號，而說明故事一年一年的進展。此外導演對於整個的演出，却不見如何成功。至少可以說没有何等精采之處。劇中没有明顯的高潮，不過是有的時候利用槍聲等使劇情突然緊張一些。而且最主要的是導演没有很好的注意到演員的表演，以致不能給與觀衆深刻的印象，甚至於是糟塌了精緻的佈景，如曼麗偕靑年律師湯姆回家的時候，除了吃了一點東西以外，簡直就没有戲做。　　演員方面，我們認爲飾曼麗的羅麗達楊是演得很好的。不過在導演的支配之下不能十分有戲做。未免可惜。從來做忠厚的好人的李卡圖加脫，在這裏飾一個反派角色的大盜，不曾如何討好觀衆。在「白宮風雲」中飾秘書的佛蘭却唐，在這裏做一個律師，更見平庸，尤其最後在法庭的一塲毫無精采。　　至餘在故事方面，更見勉强，我們承認，作者將曼麗的出身貧苦，直至淪爲盜賊，都是很現實的。一個死了母親的赤貧孤女，她能怎樣來維持生活呢？在這人吃人的社會中，除了出賣肉體以外幾乎没有生路。這是法律不能解决的問題，於是作者說明曼麗自獄中出來仍然爲盜。但是作者爲了要盡其說敎的職務而將這女人寫成了一個典型人物，於是便借用神的力量，來使她在得了橫財之後，而良心發現的捐錢給救世軍。一方面說明好並非有心作惡，另一方面說明她是心地很好的有宗敎信仰的女人。同樣，更以愛的「魔力」而使她和律師一見傾心。以這樣的方法來使她屈服於現代社會制度，到底是作者先存有說敎的誠心。他如巧合之處甚多，更見故事結構之勉强。　　照故事看來，這曼麗應當是相當値得同情的女子，但是演出的手法没有做到這一點，於是連說敎的主旨，也没有充分的獲得。然而我們並不是爲作者可惜，而是說明作者之技藝的不夠，這是必須明白聲明之處。評「鍍金的戀愛」  摩爾　　Ｐｌａｔｉｎｕｍ　Ｂｌｏｍｄｅ丨卡爾登　　編者註：「鍍金的戀愛」是張老片子，本刋去年年終已評過。不過事隔半年有餘，而前評容有未盡可言之處，故今復爲刋此評。不敏　　我覺得公式的批評這一類影片的故事，是不聰明的。因爲現在的美國影片，除了戰爭神怪之類以外，總逃不出身邊雜事的男女糾紛。至多只是把故事弄得更羅曼啻克一點，現在我且分析現社會中的男女糾紛的基本性質，因爲這樣一分析，「鍍金的變愛」的意義，同時解决。　　總括的說一句，現社會的男女糾紛，是不會超過「鍍金的戀愛」一個題目的。我們知道，資產者是不肯公開的承認物質决定意識的，特别是「戀愛」更是他們辯護觀念論的擋箭牌。他們常常拿「變愛」來責問唯物主義者，是不是也是物質决定的？而所謂「伯拉圖主義」的精神變愛，和「少年維特主義」的殉情戀愛，更是他們振振有辭的論證。　　實際上，我們知道所謂戀愛至上主羲，根本只是解决了衣食間題的有閑者的把戲，假使一個眞正的無產的那末他一定没有閑情幹這等事，自然人類是社會關係的總和，他是能動的受着橫的縱的影響，所以他們會做出連生命也不顧的「殉情。」這一點不是「庸俗的唯物論」」者（這是别于辯證的唯物論）所能解釋，而是最正確的見解，這樣戀愛的基於社會經濟組織，當然没有疑問。「鍍金的戀愛，」不過說得明顯一點罷了。　　至於「鍍金的戀愛」的技術，首先我就應該注意到他的導演，因爲他是適應着現代人的繁華頽廢的感受官能，而運用他的手腕。無論故事的展開，或則鏡頭的角度和轉換，特别剪接的地方，更顯出他的炫耀。演員方面，在這樣的故事之下，自然没有什麽特出了。主題倒底是决定一切的。觀衆意見觀「拚命」後的意見  洪鶴　　滑稽片，假使一味是糊閙，當然是没有什麽意思。現在處於絕對缺少滑稽片的中國影壇上，居然有這部「拚命」來貢獻給大衆，是當應欣喜的。　　講到故事的本身，未免有些牽强虚構；並且有幾處表情脫不了文明戲的公式，同時又犯了襲抄外片最討厭的令人作嘔的錯打。　　攝影，有幾處光線太弱。佈景簡陋，在廚房的一個佈景；衣服都飛舞起來丨丨一望而知是露天拍的。并且在這段事實中更是太虚構了，奈道百萬巨富的家中，廚房會如此的简陋，而且除了他倆人以外，連一個佣人都没有麽？　　此外，幾段諷刺和激發愛國心的挿穿，是極可喜的，密「仁丹治猪病，「味四素」醫痔瘡等。」　　末了，我希望中國的滑稽影片，能夠在「質」的方面，多少下些確切的修養，給大衆深刻而有益的影象；因爲中國人大都是喜歡看滑稽片丨丨尤其是未成年的兒童！「拚命」之我評  喻家卿　　「拚命」是劉春山繼「雞鴨夫妻」後的又一滑稽戰事片。　　劇情是很平淡，没有一些驚人的地方，幾個滑稽的穿挿，很覺乏味，如僕役阿戇誤取活魚進客，賓客大驚，王和成意逃到灶間去避，事實上以我的愚想，世界上没有這樣膽小的人，不過導演强要使觀衆一笑而已。　　導演有幾處很平淡，没有一些技巧，小疵點的地方很多，没有一些驚人的地方，幾個笑料，使人頓覺無味。　　演員劉春山前半部表演有些做作、後半部尙佳、黃耐霜尙很稱職，其餘幾個配演均平平而已。「飛絮」在北京開映　　「飛絮」爲天一公司兩年以來之第一部無聲片，該公司自前年夏間開始有聲電影以後，無聲電影卽停止不拍，直至今年，始實行聲默兼攝之計畫，首次出品，卽爲「飛絮」，該片由邵醉翁導演，湯曉舟助導，袁美雲，鮑志超，王慧娟合演，故事叙述一不幸女子，自幼卽因父親重男輕女，加以白眼，又因父母聽信日者之言，拆散其垂成之好姻緣，從此爲婢爲養媳，沉淪苦海，勿克自拔，劇情委婉悽苦，頗爲動人，現定本月十四日起，在本埠北京大戲院開映云。電影小說小玩意（二）  袁叢美　　「葉大嫂醒子没有？漁者淹口輕聲的問。順手把魚遞給老葉。老葉不敢出聲，微微的一」笑，搖一搖頭，於是漁者撑開他的船，搖向城裏去了。　　「葉大嫂醒了没有」？賣糖的，作泥人的，賣紙花的，力士···一大羣人圍了過來問。「没有醒呢」！老葉低聲回答。衆人不敢作聲，悄悄的走開。　　老葉提着魚回至屋裏，葉大嫂仍是未醒，在被的外面，伸展着他赤踝踝的臂膊。老葉過去替她拉上被窩。她微微的動了一動。老葉愈是小心着走，就愈是閙出亂子，一個不留神，踏在竹筒上，仰天翻身，跌倒在地上。一手拉住竹簍，竹簍也倒下來。於是葉大嫂驚醒了。老葉顫抖着，連牙齒也駭得震慄作聲。珠兒伏在他懷裏，那隻黑花狗也挾着尾巴不動。周遭的空氣立刻緊張起來。　　「過來」葉大嫂雌威不露地喊着。老葉發抖，珠兒害怕得哭了！「過來！你怕我吃了你嗎」？葉大嫂冷冷的喚老葉。　　在恐怖中，老葉顫抖地向床前走去。兩膝像彈簧支持樣的搖震。葉大嫂推他坐在竹椅中，連頭也不敢抬起來。她微微的嘆一口氣，把樣子轉變得温和些，伸手去撫老葉的頭頸，老葉反而駭了一跳。　　「你爲什麽這樣怕我？以後不許做出這種可憐兒了」！葉大嫂很温和地撫他的臉，老葉依然戰抖，點首應允，没有出聲。　　「不來了」！葉大嫂看他還是那幅可憐的樣子，佯作生氣，把身子轉向床裏去。　　葉大嫂看珠兒還在哭，忙拉她到自已懷中，「小傻子才哭哩」！用指尖承着晶晶欲滴的淚點，瞄準着牆上泥和尙的臉彈去，於是那泥和尙倘着滴滴的淚珠，葉大嫂笑了，珠兒笑了，老葉也笑了！　　忽兒床内的玉兒大哭。玉兒甫满一歲，胖胖的，也如老葉般的痴肥。葉大嫂抱起他，吻他的小臉。老葉接過玉兒，弄弄他，放他在站籠裏。自已再到碗櫉邊去取碗盛粥，鹹魚，燻鴨，和一把把洒壶。用一個盤把這些装好端到葉大嫂的面前。老葉又爲她斟酒。這時候的葉大嫂變得嬌滴滴的，對着老葉媚笑，撫他的臉。　　老葉受寵若驚，像一隻小麻雀似的跳到珠兒跟前，忙着搬桌椅，盛頹飯。「今天媽媽高興」，我們大家也都高興」！　　老葉說完憨笑，使勁地咬饅頭一口。老葉跳着，笑着，把饅頭分給玉兒和狗。但他不當心又跌在木盆中了，葉大嫂看見縐縐眉，不忍的樣子笑起來。（未完）</p>

<p>Bandit Problems in Qinhuangdao and Other Areas are Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>Tao Yin and Yin Rugeng Appointed as Administrative Inspectors</p>
<p>Tao Shangming Summoned to the South by Huang Fu's Telegram</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the bandit suppression affairs in the war zone, Yu Xuezhong is actively preparing after returning to Tianjin, waiting for the representatives sent to Changchun for negotiations to return before beginning. Yu Xuezhong is also planning the emergency relief for the war zone with the various committee members. The establishment of administrative inspectors for Luan, Yu, Ji, and Mi was approved by the Executive Yuan's meeting yesterday and granted for record. Tao Shangming, the administrative inspector of Luan and Yu, went to Beijing this morning to request instructions on everything and will also go to Shanghai to meet with Yin Rugeng, the administrative inspector of Ji and Mi, to discuss matters. After the regulations of the inspector's office are promulgated and the official order is formally issued, Tao Yin will go to Luan and Mi to establish the inspector's office to implement and be responsible for handling all matters in the war zone. (Thirteenth day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, many bandits have gathered in eastern Luan, forming a major problem. According to reports, these bandits are colluding with Li Jichun, Shi Yousan, etc., and receiving assistance from a certain party, taking the opportunity to harass, mostly invading from the Rehe border, appearing and disappearing in the area around the Great Wall. The Reception Committee has formulated a meticulous plan for this, blocking their routes of entry on one hand and cutting off their assistance on the other, so as to thoroughly suppress them. Progress is expected in the short term. The special police are being trained, and it is decided to temporarily train 9,000 people according to the original plan, increasing or decreasing them at any time according to actual needs. The departure date has not been determined. After the representatives sent out of the pass to negotiate arrive in Changchun, no concrete report has arrived in Beiping. It is estimated that it will take about twenty days before they can return to Beiping to report back. All problems can be resolved by then. In addition, the Reception Committee Tao Shangming took the Pingpu train to Beijing at 7:00 AM on the thirteenth. (Thirteenth day Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming was summoned by Huang Fu's telegram and went south on the thirteenth afternoon. (Thirteenth day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The administrative inspectors of the war zone have been internally determined: Tao Shangming for Luan and Yu, and Yin Rugeng for Ji and Mi.

<p>(Beiping) He Qigong stated that Huang Fu had previously sent a telegram to Beiping, stating that he would return to Beiping within three to five days. The rumors that Huang would not return north and that the Political Reorganization Committee would be reorganized are inaccurate. Regarding the war zone's bandit suppression and the reception issues at various ports, the bandit suppression issue has been stalled due to Huang's southward journey. Yu Xuezhong is currently sending personnel to negotiate. The Japanese side has not yet made any concrete statements and a concrete solution is expected after the representatives sent to Changchun return. The situation in various counties in the war zone, except for the bandit problems, all subsequent administrations are generally smooth. There is no news of the rumors that I will be transferred to head the Tianjin and Qingdao municipalities, even if this happens, I will definitely not do it. Because I did not know about the director of the Ping Municipality Public Security Bureau incident beforehand, I have no opinion. However, this is a local incident and should not cause any problems. It is estimated that there will be a proper solution after the new director's five-day vacation is over. The rumor that Huang Fu has used his resignation to argue for this is purely a rumor.

<p>The Nose of the Plane is Damaged and Transported to Xuzhou</p>
<p>Chen Wenlin Talks About the Flight Experience</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Chen Wenlin was flying the Jiang Que plane north when he was forced to land in a melon field at Sanbao Station, south of Xuzhou, on the afternoon of the twelfth due to rain. The nose of the plane was damaged. Chen took the Jinpu night train to Xuzhou that night. This morning, the aviation station sent someone to Sanbao to transport the plane to the Xuzhou station. The reporter recently met Chen at the aviation station. Chen said that he had telegraphed to Beijing to send someone to Xuzhou for repairs, which will be completed in about a week. Whether he will leave Xuzhou first within days has not yet been determined. (Thirteenth day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Chen Wenlin told the reporter that he and Section Chief Pan were flying the Jiang Que plane when they arrived at Sanbao North at 12:30 PM on the twelfth, just six minutes away from Xuzhou. The oil pipe in the plane suddenly ruptured, and he was afraid of causing a fire, so for safety reasons, he chose a flat place to land. Unexpectedly, the ground was loose and loose after the rain. As soon as the plane landed, it suddenly entered the soil. The wheels of the plane could not move forward, so the nose of the plane overturned and rotated, causing the wings to break. The upper right wing and the lower left wing fell with minor injuries. The nose of the plane was slightly damaged. Fortunately, he and Section Chief Pan were safe. He immediately disassembled the parts and placed them in the fuselage, pushed it to Sanbao Station, and asked the stationmaster there to hire workers to push it to Xuzhou by land on the morning of the thirteenth. The extent of the damage is very small and can be easily repaired. He and others came to Xuzhou last night and have telegraphed the Ministry of Navy to send personnel to purchase rotary wings and other parts to Xuzhou for repairs. They will be completed in a week and continue to fly north to complete the planned plan. Our country's aviation is backward and it is difficult to build airplanes by ourselves. This time, Chen and Section Chief Pan built the Jiang Que plane, which cost only 10,000 yuan, saving two-thirds of the cost compared to imported products, so it is flying across the country to promote it. He originally planned to fly with Mr. Sun Tonggang, but because the routes are different, he hopes that the compatriots across the country will pay attention to manufacturing airplanes by themselves and save the country without relying on foreigners.

<h3 id="e18">Lessons from the Yellow River Flood Zi <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>This Yellow River flood has extended to five provinces. According to the report of Li Yizhi, chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the disaster area in the provinces along the river is about 15,000 square li, and the number of victims reaches more than 1.1 million. The disaster situation is most tragic in the eighteen counties of Western Shandong, followed by the three counties of Southern Hebei, and then by the ten counties along the river in Henan Province. The three counties of Eastern Xuzhou are only the aftermath. The thirty counties that reported disasters in Shaanxi were not entirely due to the overflow of the Yellow River. The water disaster started with the heavy rains in Shaanxi in late July, which caused the river to be full. On August 3, the bandits in Southern Hebei breached the embankment of Changyuan, flooding Puyang and Dongming. The upstream water rose and the embankment in Southern Hebei was breached, accelerating the flow of water. Then, in mid-August, the Yellow River overflowed in Henan Province. After the breach of Lanfeng, the flood poured into Western Shandong. The Caozhou area was hit. The water from Lanfeng entered the silted Yellow River, and the counties of Feng and Pei in Eastern Xuzhou were also affected.</p>
<p>At present, the autumn flood has subsided slightly, and the disaster can be avoided from escalating. It is urgent to handle emergency relief and quickly plug the breach and repair the embankments. However, after reviewing the records of the past forty-odd days since the beginning of the Yellow River flood and recalling the terror of the more than a month of summer floods in the Yangtze River, we believe that China today must unify water management policies, allocate huge sums of money, and undertake large-scale water conservancy projects. This is also a major lesson that the Yellow River flood has given to our government. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Ministry of Interior is planning to control national water conservancy and is preparing to convene a water conservancy conference. In terms of the responsibilities of the Ministry of Interior, this move is extremely meaningful. However, in terms of the government's entire water management administration, it seems that it should not only stop there after this flood. At present, those who are specifically engaged in water management administration under the National Government include the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the Huai River Guidance Commission, the Guangdong River Management Committee, the Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Commission, and the North China Water Conservancy Commission. In addition, there are the National Economic Commission and the Construction Commission, which also have water management responsibilities. There are numerous institutions, and the expenses are not insignificant. What are the achievements? The people of the country only need to examine the facts of the past six months to know. How about thoroughly reorganizing the various water conservancy agencies and establishing a large-scale National Water Conservancy Commission? With a large-scale Water Conservancy Commission, talents for water management can be concentrated, and they will usually be responsible for guiding people in matters beneficial to water conservancy, such as dredging, repairing, and planting trees. In case of emergency, they will go to handle the symptomatic treatment work, invigorate their spirits, and do their work with all their hearts. It can be asserted that their achievements must be better than those who are currently scattered and energetic. To give a recent example, if we put the Yellow River's fullness in Shaanxi in the category of natural disasters, if there were responsible people to quickly remedy the breach of Changyuan's embankment, Southern Hebei would not have suffered such a major disaster. When the water reached Lanfeng, if the embankment protectors were experts with water conservancy knowledge and experience, the embankment could have been preserved, and Western Shandong would not have become a translator's country.</p>
<p>It is also imperative for the government to allocate huge sums of money specifically for water management. For this Yellow River flood, the Executive Yuan decided to give 4 million yuan. No matter how serious the disaster situation is or how many victims there are, it is like a cup of water on a burning cart. Even if it is sufficient, its use is only passive relief, and it cannot be active construction. How is it more advantageous to plan in advance and allocate huge sums of money to engage in disaster prevention? The cotton and wheat loan has been decided to be used for the revival of rural areas. Water conservancy projects have an important relationship with the revival of rural areas. If the authorities can allocate one-fifth of the 50 million US dollars, they can temporarily take care of the situation. May the authorities not be stingy with it.</p>
<p>There are large rivers all over China. Every year during the summer and autumn flood season, there will be water disasters in this place or that. Saving them piecemeal, money is no different from throwing it away. Use a portion of the cotton and wheat loan and use the technology of the League of Nations water conservancy experts to actively engage in water conservancy. This is what the people of the country expect from the authorities, and it is also what the authorities can use to show their love for the people.</p>

It is proposed to adopt an executive committee system, which will be drafted by the Executive Yuan, with Wang, Sun, and Song as the executive committee members, and submitted for review and approval. (2) The proposed distribution method for cotton and wheat loans is to be used for production projects and rural revival. The Economic Committee will handle it according to this principle, and another supervision and custody agency will be established. Wang's report on the two cases lasted for more than an hour. It is heard that all the committee members present expressed their unanimous approval. (Thirteenth day Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Please Allocate Cotton and Wheat Loans</p>
<p>Complete the Longhai Railway</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Party Departments and mass organizations of the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang urgently telegraphed Chiang, Wang, and Song yesterday, requesting the allocation of 10 million yuan from the cotton and wheat loans to complete the Longhai Railway and fundamentally relieve the rural areas of the Northwest: (1) In the Northwest provinces, the grain is cheap and hurts farmers in bumper years, and they sit and wait for death in lean years. Therefore, the rural economy itself cannot be restored due to transportation relations. (2) Because they are far from the central government, ambitious people dream of becoming bigger. There are more soldiers than people who produce, and there are more bandits than soldiers who harm the people. If politics is not on the right track, it is difficult to stabilize society, and how can rural areas be restored? If we talk about rescuing the devastated land, what can we do? (3) If the Longhai Railway can be completed immediately, all obstacles will disappear, and the wealth of the Southeast will flow to make the most of the Northwest's land. The rural areas of the Northwest will be stabilized immediately, and farmers' production can prosper without relief. (4) It is better to set up a farmers' bank with the railway profits than to temporarily grant favors. Even problems such as national defense and border preparation depend on the understanding of the matter. Please, your excellencies, allocate 10 million yuan from this loan as a road construction fund, start construction on a scheduled date, and complete it within a limited time. The Northwest is fortunate, and the country is fortunate. (Thirteenth day special dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Negotiations for a loan to the German "Hsi" Steel Factory have recently been suspended. This is because the preliminary contract agreed upon last year was based on Pukou as the location. The German budget was based on this. Now that the location has been changed to Ma'anshan, the equipment costs and transport of machinery must be increased due to inconvenient transportation. Whether the German manufacturers are willing to invest heavily in Ma'anshan is still under consideration. It is now reported that the Ministry of Industry has suspended negotiations. Furthermore, it is said that Chen Gongbo has not discussed steel factory matters with Song in Shanghai. This matter concerns construction, and it would be more appropriate to discuss it after the establishment of the Economic Committee. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Plan to be Proposed at the Liang-Huai Reclamation Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Liang-Huai Reclamation Conference is scheduled to be held on the 15th at the Ministry of Industry. The Huai River Development Committee will send its Chief Engineer Xu Kai to attend. Mr. Xu also has a plan to open a new canal in Liang-Huai. The plan includes: opening expenses of $36,000; surveying expenses of $1,000; measurement costs of $20,000; construction costs for the first phase, building ship locks and earthwork at Doulonggang and Chenjiagang, $300,000; totaling $2,066,600, to be completed in two years. The second phase, including water gate bridge culvert maritime engineering and other recurring expenses, is tentatively budgeted at $3,000,000. The entire river is 270 kilometers long. The cost of planting saplings along the dikes is $36,000, and the contingency fund is $120,000. The total estimated cost is $8.3 million. The benefited fields are estimated at over 300 kilometers in Chenjiagang, totaling over 13.8 million mu. The funds for land purchase, etc., for the first phase of the project are estimated at $2.8 million and should be raised first. The second phase is planned to be financed by collecting benefit donations and land reclamation fees in the area where the first phase of earthwork is completed. The average levy is $2 per mu, to be paid in five annual installments, with each mu paying $0.40 per year, yielding an annual revenue of $786,000. There are also 2.025 million mu of barren and developed land, with an average levy of $1 per mu, also to be paid in five annual installments, with each mu paying $0.20 per year, yielding an annual revenue of $405,000. The total revenue in five years would be $2,025,000. The total revenue from both sources would be $5,955,000. If payment is overdue, the land will be purchased at the price before the new canal is completed. Developed land will receive a subsidy for land reclamation. 80,000 mu of wasteland along the river will be purchased to build new towns. Subsequently, the land price will naturally increase, and it will be resold at $20 per mu, totaling $1.2 million when fully sold. West of the Fanggong Dike, where the new canal will be built, there are approximately 12 million mu. Excluding the 4.05 million mu within 10 kilometers west of the new canal, there are still 7.95 million mu. A levy of $0.08 per mu per year would yield an annual revenue of $636,000, totaling $3.18 million over five years. The total estimated revenue above is $10.335 million, which is sufficient to cover all construction costs with a surplus. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Araki Proposes National Policy Plan</p>
<h3 id="e26">Japanese Political Situation Suddenly Becomes Tense <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>War Minister Says "Manchuria Problem is Above All Else"</p>
<p>Emphasizes the Necessity of Strengthening National Defense</p>
<p>Frequent Contacts Between Cabinet Members in Recent Days</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of establishing national policy by the government has suddenly become tense since War Minister Araki presented the military's research on national policy and actively participated in the issue. The government is waiting for the government to take active action due to the internal and external situation and the current state of rural areas. Meeting with representatives of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, it obtained a unified national opinion to implement the national policy. However, simply sitting idly by would only cause more anxiety. Therefore, just as it was forced to implement the national policy that was due, the sudden proposal of the War Minister's important national policy greatly moved all aspects of the political world.</p>
<p>War Minister Araki recently presented a plan to Prime Minister Saito to establish national policy. On the 9th, he met with Finance Minister Takahashi and Vice Minister Shigemitsu, representative of Foreign Minister Uchida, to discuss important national policy proposals. On the 12th, he met with Prime Minister Saito, Naval Minister Osumi, Agriculture Minister Goto, and others to discuss national policy issues. Prime Minister Saito also consulted with Home Minister Yamamoto and Finance Minister Takahashi on national policy issues on the same day. Naval Minister Osumi and Finance Minister Takahashi exchanged important views on national defense national policy and ideological education economic finance issues. Thus, the national policy issue is extremely tense, and cabinet members are frequently traveling and meeting. The War Minister has now resolved to submit the national policy to the cabinet meeting after obtaining the understanding of the cabinet members, in order to implement the most serious emergency national policy. (Japanese Allied Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When War Minister Araki met with the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister, he explained the urgency of the international situation and emphasized the necessity of strengthening national defense. He also presented the military's private proposal on national defense financial resources, stating that an extraordinary tax increase of about 50 million yuan could be implemented from the ninth year. With this as interest, another 1 billion yuan in special accounting military bonds could be issued, which would not be mixed with deficit bonds. If the repayment period is forcibly extended, 1 billion yuan in financial resources could be obtained. The Prime Minister and Finance Minister both replied that although the extraordinary tax increase of about 50 million yuan is set aside for now, the strengthening of national defense is necessary and should be considered with a permanent financial source, issuing special accounting military bonds. The issue of financial resources for military expenses will become a political issue and will be discussed by the cabinet. (Den-tsu dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) At 9:30 AM on the 9th of this month, War Minister Araki visited Finance Minister Takahashi and had a confidential talk for three and a half hours. The Japanese political world regards this as an important meeting, and it is rumored to be a preparatory work for the military to actively control the political situation. If its opinions cannot be accepted by the government, the military may seize power. However, its content remains secret. According to the outline reported by the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on September 10, it is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e28">Manchuria Problem <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Manchuria problem, I (Araki self-proclaimed) have already explained its current situation to the Emperor. The most urgent issue for Japan at present is the Manchuria problem. Even if we abandon everything, we must seek the healthy development of "Manchukuo." This is the most fundamental national policy. All other national policies should arise from this. The actual situation in Manchuria in the past two years seems to be reforming various systems and developing industries with the force of a bursting river, gradually proceeding according to the planned plan. The public security is also almost the same as before the incident, and the soldiers of the Sixth Division can return to defense. Taking advantage of this opportunity, we must redouble our efforts in industrial development, and the results can be expected.</p>
<h3 id="e29">China Problem <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>After Song Ziwen returned to China, key figures of the National Government gathered in Lushan to discuss and study various important domestic and foreign issues. Although China is currently eager to change its policy toward Japan, its domestic situation may not allow it to change. Japan's fundamental policy toward China has always been to maintain friendly relations between the two countries. If the method is not right, it will be manipulated by China. We must be very vigilant and quietly observe its general trend. Regarding emergencies, all relevant agencies should earnestly connect and cooperate to deal with them.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Foreign Relations <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The world situation may not be favorable to Japan after its withdrawal from the League of Nations. If China abandons its diplomacy of using barbarians to control barbarians, it is difficult to expect its rapid improvement. Moreover, 1935 and 1936 are imminent, and the naval treaty and the time of withdrawal from the League of Nations are all coming. At this time, when Japan's naval power is relatively inferior to that of Britain and the United States, a crisis in East Asia will come. Japan fears that it will encounter unprecedented national disasters. In today's international situation, which is difficult to improve, expanding national defense is essential to maintain peace in the East. The navy is eager to implement the second replenishment plan, which can be said to be a natural requirement. In order to prepare for Russia and China, the army should prepare a strong army. This is the best way to maintain peace. It should not be plagued by financial and technical problems and leave harm to the future. Foreign policy should aim for 1935 and 1936, and should be consistent with the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Education Problem <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Japanese education after the Meiji era has indeed developed across generations, but recent education is mostly education for the sake of education, forgetting the education needed by the country and the people. Communist Party members also come from the proletariat and illiterate classes, but many have received higher education, which is due to shortcomings in our education. Therefore, we must create Japanese people who can understand the unparalleled Japanese national essence. The basic restoration of education to this spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Ideological Problem <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Due to the shortcomings of the education system, ideology is affected, which has been described above. There are also many reasons for promoting ideological deterioration in political and economic organizations. Such shortcomings can be corrected to a certain extent by the power of politicians. Therefore, we must overcome all difficulties and seek to renew all administrations. In short, Japan must make "Manchukuo" sound and developed, and at the same time, it must break the current national difficulties. At this time, politicians, educators, and knowledgeable people in the private sector must unite to solve it. In order to achieve this goal, the government should first decide on a national policy and do its best to implement it. War Minister Araki said after the meeting that what is needed at present is only to act decisively. (China United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Minister of Commerce Acts as a Lobbyist for the Military</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Commerce Nakajima visited Prime Minister Saito this afternoon at 1:00 PM to explain the content of the Five-Year Fuel National Policy Plan. At 2:30 PM, he continued to visit Finance Minister Takahashi for the same explanation, and requested understanding for the 6 million yen needed in the first year. Finance Minister Takahashi said after the meeting that the fuel national policy was decided by the committees of the former ministries, and the navy also sent a committee member. Because it is absolutely necessary for national defense, it will be investigated as one aspect of strengthening national defense. (Den-tsu dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan believes that the world situation is very urgent. Once a war breaks out, the fuel for warships, tanks, aircraft, and various traffic institutions depends on foreign supply, which is very dangerous for national defense. In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Army and Navy, and the Resources Bureau (the main agency for economic mobilization planning) organized the Fuel National Policy Coordination Council to earnestly study countermeasures. After two deliberations, it was found that the opinions of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Resources Bureau differed greatly from those of the military, and it seemed difficult to compromise. Later, due to the urgency of the budget submission period, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry succumbed to the military at a meeting on September 8, and drafted a five-year plan based on the military's plan, with a budget of 26 million yuan to complete this project. The initial year's budget is set at 4 million yuan. Here are a few of the military's main points: (1) Vigorously support the research of liquefied coal to make this invention practical and help its enterprise; (2) Help the modified alcohol industry to replace kerosene. This raw material, such as molasses, is very abundant in Japan, and it will not be frustrated halfway in an emergency; (3) Actively support the mining area of ​​the Sakhalin kerosene test excavation and increase the kerosene production; (4) Use the natural gas of the Jinshui oil field in Taiwan to manufacture gasoline; (5) Assist the existing fuel companies to develop their business; (6) Negotiate with Britain, the United States, and Russia to import oil.

<p>Ministry of Finance Reveals Inside Story of Immigration Failure</p>
<p>Military Stands on the Side of Increasing Troops to Support the Ministry of Colonial Affairs</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding armed immigration to Manchuria, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs have different opinions. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs plans to send 3,000 households and 15,000 armed immigrants, requesting 4,434,400 yuan in the new budget for 1934. The Ministry of Finance said that armed immigration has failed. More than 50 of the first phase of immigrants have fled, and many others have died, deserted, or been injured or sick. In this time of financial emergency, apart from military expenses, agricultural relief expenses, national defense, and stationing troops in Manchuria, it is not appropriate to waste money on this kind of project that is labor-intensive and has little merit. It is heard that the Ministry of the Army is strongly supporting the Ministry of Colonial Affairs to compete with the Ministry of Finance because armed immigration is a disguised increase in troops.

<p>Telegraphs Ito and Others to Monitor Actions of Various Countries</p>
<p>Does Not Care About China's Request for Sanctions</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations General Assembly will be held in Geneva on September 25. It is reported that China will again raise the Sino-Japanese issue. Depending on the situation, it may request the application of Article 16 of the Covenant for sanctions. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the following views on this: (1) The move by the League of Nations General Assembly to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue again is probably because the Chinese side believes that even if this opportunity is missed once, the meaning of not recognizing the puppet state is equivalent to interruption, which puts the Nanjing government in a difficult situation internally. From this point of view, it may have plans to appeal to the League of Nations again; (2) Although the League of Nations adheres to the principle of not reviewing the same matter again, there are the Rehe issue and the North China issue after the recommendation was adopted, which can be a new content for the appeal. Therefore, if China appeals in this way, the League of Nations will have to accept it; (3) However, Japan has already occupied Rehe by force, and a satisfactory ceasefire agreement has been established with the Chinese side on the North China issue, and there is no need to bother the League of Nations again. Moreover, if there is no risk of war between China and Japan, there is no room for the application of Article 16 of the Covenant. Even if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not send representatives to attend this General Assembly, no matter what the content of China's appeal is, it will not feel any pain. However, for the sake of perfection, it has ordered Ito Noboru and Yokoyama Masayuki, two councillors, to travel to Geneva. If the League of Nations General Assembly has insufficient understanding of Japan, it will meet with representatives of that country to explain separately. This is the policy that the main department of foreign affairs has decided. Yesterday afternoon, it had telegraphed instructions to foreign relations ambassadors.

<p>US Senator to Visit Russia</p>
<p>Entrusted with Important Mission</p>
<p>(New York) The United States' recognition of Soviet Russia is imminent. Senator McCumber will take a ship to Europe tomorrow, heading to Moscow. McCumber denies that this trip has official significance, but he made it clear that the purpose of his visit to Russia is to promote recognition of Soviet Russia. He said that he hopes to find evidence that proves that the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia is logical and conscious. It is heard that Mr. McCumber will stay briefly in Paris and Berlin, but it is of no importance. McCumber is an important figure in the Democratic Party and is known for his correct judgment. He is a famous financier and businessman. He served as the Minister of Finance during the European War and achieved remarkable political achievements. This time to Russia will definitely have important results. According to the recognition of Soviet Russia, business leaders in the United States all believe that it is one of the most important issues for the current government, because it is a great market for selling goods. Therefore, everyone outside believes that President Roosevelt personally supports this move. Therefore, New York bankers hope that McCumber's investigation will be sufficient to eliminate the resistance of stubborn factions in the Senate. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>

<p>The Nagoya Shimbun reported on the 6th that the Police Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs discussed the crackdown on the recent disruption of public order at this national security section chief meeting. In recent times, people's minds have been frivolous and frivolous, and the atmosphere of dissipation and licentiousness has become increasingly intense. The operators and employees of the object of the customs police only cater to the current trend and compete for new and strange business equipment, which has led to increasingly ugly and obscene words and deeds in society. Therefore, special attention will be paid to the equipment of the business site and newly established operators. As for the former protection of the freedom of prostitutes, the restriction on the outing of prostitutes has been abolished. However, in recent times, the outing of prostitutes has been decorated with enchanting and strange decorations, which has greatly affected customs. The Police Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs has instructed each county to separately crack down on this.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Cuba's New Cabinet Established, Situation Remains Bleak <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Retired Military Officers Yet to Yield</p>
<p>US Declares Retention of Right to Intervene</p>
<p>Havana: Although Cuba's new cabinet has been formed, it is reported that unless the faction of former President Miguel Mariano Gómez Menocal can be persuaded to join or at least adopt a position of tacit support, a new revolution will brew. Today, as the new President Grau San Martín formed his cabinet, he invited all factions and revolutionaries to support it in order to strengthen its power and prevent American intervention. However, former President Miguel Mariano Gómez Menocal and Céspedes are unwilling to support this "government of scholars" and are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Although Céspedes is currently neutral and has not agreed to join the banner of anti-government forces with the three hundred-odd military officers who were recently ousted, Gómez Menocal does not wish to comment on the new government, stating only that he cannot honestly support it and predicting that the new government may not last for a week. However, he also indicated to his friends that he does not wish to be president himself, knowing that it would be difficult to please all factions and at the same time completely satisfy the United States. It is noted that although Gómez Menocal has never taken any action against the United States, he was not well-received in Washington due to his increased spending and taxes during his term.</p>
<p>Today, the new Cuban President appointed Sterling as Secretary of State, Arlanzo as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Sampol as Secretary of Labor, and Boteler as Secretary of Justice. Sterling is an experienced diplomat and journalist who was appointed as ambassador to the United States by Céspedes and has a good relationship with the Americans. It is said that the Cuban President's appointment of Sterling as Secretary of State is intended to gain American favor. It is noted that Sterling was also among the representatives when the Platt Amendment to the US-Cuba Treaty was discussed in 1901 and vigorously opposed the inclusion of the amendment in the treaty and the Cuban Constitution. It is heard that Sterling currently believes that even if the Platt Amendment can be abolished in the Cuban Constitution, it will be difficult to remove it from the treaty between the two countries or from the minds of people in Washington at this time. It is reported that US Ambassador Welles plans to visit Sterling tomorrow, and it is expected that the Platt Amendment will be discussed.</p>
<p>Havana: The four hundred Cuban military officers staying at the National Hotel are currently refusing the new government's ultimatum to submit immediately. The new government has issued a harsh ultimatum, ordering these four hundred officers to change their attitude within thirty-six hours, otherwise, drastic measures will be taken. However, this threat is not taken seriously by the officers. They have set up obstacles and made other preparations to resist any violent actions by the government. They insist that Dr. Céspedes must be reinstated as president and refuse to obey the orders of the new President San Martín. It is noted that the National Hotel is currently sheltering many American family members who sought refuge there during the revolution, so the hotel is under the protection of American warships' guns. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, American officials solemnly declared that although the US government wishes to avoid intervention in Cuba, it wants to vigorously retain the right to intervene. The current situation in Cuba seems to have raised the issue of the existence or abolition of the Platt Amendment in the Cuban Constitution. News from Havana indicates that the new Cuban government is advocating for the removal of all provisions in the new constitution that recognize the special rights of the United States. However, from the standpoint of national defense and the large commercial investments in Cuba, the United States believes that the Platt Amendment must be retained. Therefore, it is anticipated that regardless of any action taken by the new Cuban government, the United States will retain the right to intervene. It is noted that the Platt Amendment was originally an amendment to the US Army budget bill in 1901. It was subsequently added to the Cuban Constitution as an annex before the transfer of governance to Cuba and stipulated in the treaty between the two countries. Now the new Cuban government is demanding the complete abolition of this clause recognizing the right of the United States to intervene in order to achieve full sovereignty.

<p>American Recovery Movement in Peril</p>
<h3 id="e44">Roosevelt Likely to Be Forced to Implement Inflation Plan <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Expand Popular Purchasing Power</p>
<p>Wage Increases and Price Increases Are Not Proportional</p>
<p>Harrison Makes Emergency Recommendations to the Government for Remedial Action</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt today received a proposal from Senator Harrison, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, advocating reasonable inflation. Harrison stated that prices are bound to rise, and he advocated a reasonable inflation measure. "We must work harder than we are now to assist both bankers and rural farmers. Those who truly need assistance now are the farmers." At this time of boom and bust, with prices rising and falling, Harrison's recommendations to the American President are bound to be important. Although National Recovery Administration executive General Johnson is vigorously promoting "buy now," consumers are not responding much. The perilous state of the American President's prosperity movement can be seen here. Although wages have increased, they are not enough to offset the increase in prices. Farmers are voicing complaints that the prices of agricultural products are far lower than the prices of manufactured goods. Many observers anticipate that President Roosevelt will be forced to implement an inflation plan to expand popular purchasing power. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Washington) William Green, Secretary of the American Federation of Labor, issued a warning today, stating that the National Recovery Administration must act quickly. If seven or eight million people are still unemployed in the winter, workers cannot be guaranteed stability. If the unemployment crisis in the winter is to be prevented, weekly working hours must be genuinely reduced, and wages must be genuinely increased. The guarantee that industry codes issued by General Johnson will not be included in the "achievement" clauses must not be changed. The current capital is full of manufacturers and financiers who intend to restore the old system. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(New York) Twenty-five coal mines in southwestern Pennsylvania are currently closed, and ten thousand miners are on strike. The situation is no less intense than last month. The number of strikers is feared to reach as many as sixty thousand. The reason is that mine owners have delayed signing the code for the soft coal mining industry, namely, they are unwilling to recognize the union, leading to the workers' anger and this action.

<h3 id="e50">Shrinking the Earth <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>In the Past, It Took Three Years to Circumnavigate the World</p>
<p>Today, It Only Takes a Little Over a Week by Plane</p>
<p>Reuters New York Correspondence: Since the invention of the airplane, mankind has acquired the art of shrinking the earth. In the past, it took one thousand and eighty-three days to circumnavigate the world; today, it has been reduced to a little over a week. Historically, those who circumnavigated the world include Magellan, who led five ships with a total of two hundred and eighty people on September 20, 1519, from Seville, Spain, of which only the Victoria, carrying thirty-five people (excluding Magellan), successfully returned in three years minus twelve days. In 1577, Sir Francis Drake's expedition departed from Plymouth, England, returning in one thousand and fifty-two days. In 1586, Thomas Cavendish departed from the same location, reducing the journey to seven hundred and eighty-one days. In 1889, female journalist Nellie Bly, using New York as her starting point, circumnavigated the world by steamship and train, taking seventy-two days, six hours, and eleven minutes. She was the first traveler of the new era. In 1913, Mills also departed from New York, completing the entire journey in thirty-five days, twenty-one hours, and thirty-six minutes. Later, there was the magnificent feat of circumnavigating the world by airplane. Initially, it was accomplished by several American military airplanes in 1924 in one hundred and seventy-five days, but the actual flying time was only fourteen days and fifteen hours. They departed from Seattle, passing through Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, the Kuril Islands, China, India, Constantinople, Budapest, Paris, Glasgow, Reykjavik, Greenland, Labrador, Boston, and returning to the starting point. In 1925, Evans and Wells completed the entire journey in twenty-eight days, fourteen hours, and thirty-six minutes, traveling across mountains and seas, using both airplanes and boats. They first traveled by boat to France, then by airplane and train to Yokohama, then by boat to Seattle, and finally by airplane to New York. In 1929, the Graf Zeppelin airship departed from Lakehurst, New Jersey, USA, and circled the world in twenty-one days, seven hours, and thirty-four minutes. In 1931, Post and Gatty, piloting an airplane together, set a record for circumnavigating the world in just eight days, fifteen hours, and fifty-one minutes. This can be said to be fast. Even this year, Post broke his own record in a little over a week. Those who come later surpass those who came before, and the progress of the future is truly limitless.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Restoration of North China Armies to Pre-War Status <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Reducing Total Military Expenses by 571,000 Yuan Monthly</p>
<p>Northeast Generals Decide to First Implement Eliminating the Weak and Retaining the Strong</p>
<p>Results of the Meeting of the Ping (Beiping) Military Council</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the outbreak of hostilities in Hebei and Rehe, the North China armies expanded their troop numbers and reorganized into army corps. Consequently, the troop strength of each army increased by more than one-third compared to pre-war levels. After the end of the war, the Chahar Incident erupted, leading to a further increase to ten army corps. According to the North China military expenditure budget, at least 5.5 million yuan or more was needed monthly. The total local tax revenue was 2.5 million yuan. Under these circumstances, the central government subsidized 2 million yuan monthly. After offsetting income and expenditure, there was still a deficit of 1 million yuan. Although it was decided that military expenses would be disbursed at 80%, with each 36 days considered a month, there was still a monthly deficit of 700,000 yuan. After Finance Minister Song Ziwen returned to China, the central government, considering the enormous military expenditures in North China, decided to find ways to reduce them and instructed He Yingqin to be responsible for consulting with the generals in the area. After receiving the central government's order, He Yingqin telegraphed all the generals to come to Beiping and scheduled a temporary meeting for 9 a.m. on the 11th at Jurentang Hall. Army corps commanders Yu Xuezhong, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, and others, after receiving the order, arrived in Beiping one after another on the evening of the 10th and exchanged views at Jurentang Hall once that evening before dispersing late at night.</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. on the 11th, the temporary meeting of the Military Council was held in the grand auditorium of Jurentang Hall. Attendees included Yu Xuezhong, Shang Zhen, Song Zheyuan, Wan Fulin, Pang Bingxun, Jiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, Bao Wenxue, Ye Biliang, Xie Jianyuan, Shen Zhenrong, Chen Qinruo, Gao Guizi, Liu Duoquan, Wu Ke'ren, Huang Shaohong, Qian Dajun, Hou Cheng, Qin Dechun, Xie Gangzhe, He Zhuguo, Wang Yizhe, Wang Shuchang, Rong Zhen, Liu Yifei, Zou Zuohua, Hu Yukun, Gao Weiyue, Ji Yiqiao, Men Zhizhong, and more than twenty others. Sun Dianying and Shen Kejun sent representatives to participate. The meeting opened at 9:40 a.m., chaired by He Yingqin. First, Shen Zhenrong, head of the ninth group of the Military Council, reported the detailed amounts of expenditures of each army and the current income and expenditure situation. Subsequently, He Yingqin stood up and spoke, stating that the total military expenditure in North China was currently 5.5 million yuan monthly, while current income was only 2.5 million yuan. The central government had to subsidize 2 million yuan monthly, totaling 4.5 million yuan, which still left a monthly deficit of 1 million yuan. Now, to address this deficit, the army must be reduced. He hoped that the leaders of each army could understand the difficulties. The standard for reducing troop numbers should be based on the company unit, with each company reducing at least twenty to thirty soldiers. He also hoped that each army could earnestly implement this. After He Yingqin finished reporting, he presented the two plans drafted by the ninth group of the Military Council. One was to reduce 700,000 yuan, and the other was to reduce more than 500,000 yuan. After the generals expressed their opinions one after another, it was decided that due to the short time, a detailed discussion could not be held, so it was decided to continue the meeting in the afternoon. The meeting temporarily adjourned at 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Because the morning meeting failed to reach a concrete decision, He Yingqin summoned the heads of the second and ninth groups and important personnel from the staff office at 1:30 p.m. to inquire about the actual income and expenditure situation of the North China military expenses. At 3 p.m., the meeting continued, with the same attendees as before. After the meeting resumed, the chairman consulted everyone's opinions. After mutual research, it was decided to announce the passage of the second plan to reduce 500,000 yuan. The reduction method was as follows: (1) The Northeast Army, consisting of the four armies of Yu Xuezhong, Wang Yizhe, Wan Fulin, and He Zhuguo, would reduce 30 soldiers per company, reducing military expenses by 400,000 yuan monthly. After the army reduction, the unit would still be restored to the division level. (2) For the four units of Sun Dianying, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, and Shang Zhen, apart from Pang and Shang's units, which met the original troop numbers, Sun Dianying's unit would reduce 40,000 yuan monthly, and Song Zheyuan's unit would also reduce 31,000 yuan. Together with the Northeast Army, the total reduction would be 571,000 yuan, which was almost equal to the current deficit. Finally, two decisions were made: (A) The number of divisions and brigades to be reduced by each army would be detailed in a table prepared by the highest-ranking officers. (B) At the regular meeting on Wednesday this week (the 13th), further thorough research would be conducted, and it was decided to organize a Finance and Supervision Committee. All opinions had been unified and would be implemented after being submitted to the standing committee. Subsequently, the meeting discussed the army training methods and adjourned at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of troop reduction and cost-saving for each army, a decision has already been made. It is now verified that in terms of cost-saving, the Northeast Army has been reorganized into divisions, with each division reducing 31,000 yuan monthly. The 32nd Army under Shang Zhen will reduce 25,000 yuan monthly, the 40th Army under Pang Bingxun will reduce 18,000 yuan monthly, the 41st Army under Sun Dianying will reduce 40,000 yuan monthly, the 106th Division under Shen Kejun will reduce 20,000 yuan monthly, and the 84th Division under Gao Guizi will reduce 900 yuan monthly. The total cost reduction for these armies is 574,900 yuan monthly. After this reduction, the total monthly expenses for each army are estimated to be 4.8 million yuan. Based on the monthly revenue of over 2 million yuan in North China and the central government's subsidy of 2 million yuan, there is a monthly shortfall of several hundred thousand yuan, which will be made up by the Military Council. In terms of troop reduction, the Northeast Army will reduce one machine gun company per regiment and one infantry company per battalion, totaling four companies per regiment. Each company will reduce 31 soldiers. In addition, a Finance and Supervision Committee will be established, with the responsible officers of each army serving as members to ensure financial transparency. A Training Committee will also be established, with regulations drafted by Qian Dajun, Shang Zhen, Rong Zhen, Zou Zuohua, Men Zhizhong, and ten others. Once the drafting is completed, preparations will be made for its establishment.</p>
<p>The generals of the Northeast Army, due to the decision made on troop reduction and cost-saving measures, found it necessary to decide on implementation immediately. Therefore, at noon today (the 12th), they convened at the private residence of Wang Yizhe, commander of the 67th Army, to discuss the method of starting the reorganization. Wang Yizhe, He Zhuguo, Liu Duoquan, Wu Ke'ren, Zhou Fucheng, and others attended. As a result of the discussion, the steps for downsizing have been decided. Each army will first eliminate the weak and retain the strong and then receive military pay according to the established regulations. If there is still a shortfall, they will request the central government to provide subsidies. (September 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Difficult Restoration of Shanxi Party Affairs <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Former Provincial Committee Member Liang Xianda Assaulted</p>
<p>Tongmeng (Alliance) Faction Members Still Active</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: According to those who recently came from Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, since the conflict between the provincial party headquarters and the student petition group in the winter of the year before last, which resulted in the death of Mu Guangzheng, a student of Jinshan Middle School, resulting in a tragic incident, the party affairs of the entire province have been in a state of stagnation. The various party committees are located in Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, with Beiping as the general hub. The mass movement in Taiyuan is being led by public associations organized by student unions, etc., as substitutes. After the Mu Guangzheng incident was resolved by the Kaifeng District Court, calls for the restoration of the party headquarters were heard from time to time. After several visits to Taiyuan by representatives sent by the central government for consultation and multiple mediations by Zhao Pilian and others, it was advocated that the old provincial party headquarters, the Datongmeng (Great Alliance) faction, and the reorganization faction should negotiate a mixed organization. However, due to factional relations, each refused to yield, and no agreement was reached. Recently, most of the old provincial party committee members believed that the situation had eased after a long period, so propaganda minister Liang Xianda and others returned to Taiyuan one after another. It is heard that Miao Peicheng, a member of the Central Committee who is most watched by society, has also arrived in the province. The student union is again opposing the arrival of Miao and others and has posted slogans all over the streets to overthrow and eradicate various "red" and "green" elements as a preliminary movement of demonstration. Unexpectedly, a strange drama of Liang Xianda being assaulted occurred during the demonstration. It turned out that Liang was having a haircut at a barber shop in Liuxiang on the afternoon of the 8th when he was suddenly spotted by a few students. While one side monitored him, the other side sent someone to summon their comrades to strengthen their momentum. In an instant, the students had gathered dozens of people. First, two people entered the barber shop, pointed at Liang, and asked if his surname was Liang. While Liang was still denying it, they dragged him out and surrounded him with the crowd. They pulled and tugged him to the memorial monument of Mu Guangzheng in Zhongshan Park, forcing Liang to kneel on the ground and asked him if he was the murderer of the tragic incident, as if in a trial, not allowing him to reply. Then, the crowd punched and kicked him, subjecting him to assault. At this time, the Public Security Bureau heard the news and sent police to rescue him, and the perpetrators fled in all directions. Liang was sent to Shanxi Hospital for treatment by the police. It is said that Liang suffered serious injuries to his waist and the skin had turned purple. According to Liang, his return to Taiyuan was by order of the central government and he was not the only one. As for the tragic incident, it had already been resolved by the Kaifeng Court. This assault was truly unexpected. Since this incident occurred, all sectors of society have paid close attention. The authorities especially convened a military and political meeting this morning (the 9th) to discuss countermeasures. Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Shurong personally asked Yan Xishan and Xu Yongchang for instructions. Yan and Xu both advocated handling the matter according to the law. After receiving the order, Chen sent personnel to arrest the student perpetrators, but they had all fled upon hearing the news and could not be found. Chen Shurong also considered that it would be inconvenient for Liang in Shanxi Hospital and planned to ask him to go to a hospital run by Westerners in Fenyang or Taigu for recuperation, but Liang refused and decided to file a criminal lawsuit with the court immediately. How the party tide in Shanxi will be resolved seems difficult to predict. It is said that Minister of Interior Huang Shaohong, who came to Taiyuan recently, had discussed specific measures. There are even those who say that Li Guanyang, the leader of the Datongmeng faction, is about to go abroad and the old provincial party headquarters will be restored. Whether this is true or not is also unknown. (September 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Chairman Chiang Kaishek Promulgates Guidelines for Relief of the People <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Instructing All Armies Suppressing Bandits and Provincial Governments to Comply</p>
<p>Correcting Errors of Harassment and Abuse of the People</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: During Chairman Chiang Kaishek's stay in Lushan, he planned to suppress the bandits, transform the military and political system, and review the shortcomings of the past army, paying particular attention to gaining the faith of the people and actively providing relief. He would then proceed to cooperate with the people. In his successive speeches, he also stated that suppressing the Red bandits was a war to win the people, not comparable to simply attacking cities and breaking enemies. Recently, he also promulgated eight guidelines for relief of the people, ordering all armies and provincial governments to comply. The main points are as follows: (1) Security of Life: Providing the people with protection against Red bandits, local tyrants, and the army. (2) Relief for Families: 1. Strictly prohibiting the forced occupation of civilian houses and destruction of civilian residences; 2. Not allowing the forced borrowing of civilian goods. In case of necessity, they must be returned responsibly; 3. Not allowing the extortion of rice, straw, or forced purchases of any goods from the people; 4. Not allowing the raising of funds, fines, or compulsory sales of goods from the people; 5. Not allowing the insult of the people and respecting their dignity. (3) Labor Relief: All previous corvée labor practices are strictly prohibited. (4) Production Relief: Protecting farmers' farming, plowing cattle, harvests, vehicles, livestock, and rural cooperatives, and finding ways to lend farmers plowing cattle, seeds, and small business capital. (5) Relief from Hunger and Cold: Making every effort to provide relief to disaster-stricken areas and refugees. (6) Construction Relief: Divided into the protection of highways, embankments, telephones, forests, etc. (7) Educational Relief: The army must not reside in schools, promote rural primary schools and basic education, and political workers must participate in education work as a duty. (8) Relief for People in Bandit Areas: One should be compassionate, appease the people in the bandit areas, and there must be no abuse or illegal acts inflicted upon the people. (September 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Zhang Qun and Others Telegraph Request to Resist Dumping of Foreign Rice <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>This Year's Rice and Wheat Harvest Abundant, Sales Increasingly Sluggish</p>
<p>Levy Import Duties on Foreign Rice to Save the Precarious Situation</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This year, the rice and wheat harvest in Hunan and Hubei provinces has been abundant, but sales have been sluggish and prices have been falling. In addition, the intrusion of foreign rice has had an impact. As a result, cheap grain hurts farmers, which has become a common phenomenon in the Yangtze River area. Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, went to Hunan at the beginning of the month to visit He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government. In addition to discussing the aftermath of the bandit areas and cooperation in water conservancy, this was also discussed. After obtaining the consent of the authorities of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, they jointly telegraphed the central government a few days ago, requesting the implementation of additional import duties on foreign rice and wheat to save the precarious situation. Chairman Chiang Kaishek has also paid attention to rural relief. A few days ago, he telegraphed the Hunan and Hubei provincial governments from Lushan, instructing them on the direction of agricultural relief and ordering them to send representatives to a meeting in Jiangxi to discuss the details. After receiving the order, the Hubei Provincial Government ordered the Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education Departments to each select one experienced rural affairs expert and researcher. These officials would then decide who would represent the province at the meeting in Jiangxi. Chairman Chiang Kaishek's telegram has been previously reported. The telegram from Zhang Qun and others is as follows: "Last year, harvests were abundant everywhere, and the yield of grain and rice increased sharply. At the same time, foreign rice and wheat were imported for dumping. This year's customs reports show that the quantity of imports has increased compared to last year. As a result, inland warehouses are overflowing, and there is no way to transport and sell the grain, which has a huge impact on the rural economy and social finance. We previously telegraphed requesting additional import duties on foreign rice and wheat in order to raise the price of Chinese rice, but it has not been implemented. Now, the new grain season is upon us, and the harvest is abundant again, while there is still a lot of grain stored from last year. Sales are increasingly sluggish, and prices are falling. Cheap grain is hurting farmers to the extreme. The cost of all the farming expenses needed by farmers cannot be covered by the price of the grain. Farmers regard their own profession as a dangerous path, and the fields are abandoned, and hidden dangers are emerging. Even industry, commerce, education, and national and local tax revenues are mutually affected because the source of income has been exhausted. Our country is based on agriculture. Foreigners' industrial and commercial aggression is already difficult to resist. If this agricultural product is also harmed by dumping, how can the people bear it? Looking ahead, we are heartbroken. It is essential to stabilize society by encouraging agricultural achievements. If the people are to farm, grain prices must increase. If no action is taken now, it will inevitably lead to collapse. Therefore, we specially telegraph earnestly, requesting the immediate implementation of additional import duties on foreign rice and wheat to resist dumping and save the precarious situation. We anxiously await your order." (September 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Trend of the Hankou Postal Strike <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Party, Government, and Military Authorities Continue Efforts to Mediate</p>
<p>Municipal Government Orders Union Not to Take Action Beyond Regulations</p>
<p>Zhao Shusen and Others Arrive in Hankou to Discuss Responsibility Issues</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The postal strike in this city is not likely to expand due to the continued mediation by the party, government, and military authorities. The postal workers' union has recently submitted a report on the situation to the provincial and municipal governments, stating that "The union was approved for registration by the municipal party headquarters, which provides a legal basis for it to be a legitimate organization. The union has requested recognition from the postal authorities, but has received no response, which has greatly hindered the union's work. Moreover, the treatment of workers at the Hankou postal bureau is far worse than that in Shanghai, and there is even more hostility towards the responsible comrades of the union. All members of the union are indignant and cannot bear it any longer. After convening a representative meeting, representatives and all executive and supervisory committee members were elected to request the municipal party headquarters to send personnel to negotiate with the postmaster, requesting written recognition of the union and requesting subsidies for union staff on a monthly basis, as is the case in other postal workers' unions, to ensure the protection and convenience of union staff. Union leaders should not handle bureau affairs, and all workers should be treated equally as in the Shanghai bureau. In addition to the earnest implementation of the proposals, we request the municipal party headquarters to send personnel to negotiate together. Therefore, we have prepared a document for reporting." After receiving the report, the provincial government telegraphed the central party headquarters and the Ministry of Transportation again to discuss a unified method and resolve the matter quickly to avoid further escalation. The municipal government also instructed the union, stating that "The case has been telegraphed by the Hubei Provincial Government to the central party headquarters and the Ministry of Transportation for consultation. Before receiving a reply from the central government, the union should wait quietly and must not take any action beyond regulations." The garrison headquarters simultaneously reported to the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Pacification Commissioner's Office that if a strike occurred and affected public security, the headquarters would only have emergency suppression measures to prevent the expansion of the dispute. Zhao Shusen and Lu Jingshi, standing committee members of the National Postal Workers' General Union, came to Hankou to mediate. On the 10th, they arrived in Hankou by the Jianguo steamer. On the 11th, they began formal negotiations with the postmaster and issued the following statement: "We have been ordered to come to Hankou because the Hankou postal authorities do not recognize the union, which has caused disputes. We are willing to take a fair attitude to seek a peaceful resolution. The Hankou postal workers' union has been established for a long time. The responsible executive and supervisory committee members and all members are united in good faith and are gradually getting on track. Moreover, in April of this year, the Hankou Special Municipality Party Headquarters clearly ordered the union to be registered, and the municipal government also had a clear statement of recognition. This provides a legal basis. The Hankou postmaster's failure to recognize the union is a result of improper handling, which has triggered a wave of unrest. We believe that the postal authorities should bear full responsibility for the creation of this incident. In today's serious national crisis, when the postal industry needs to be developed urgently, the only way to make progress is to strengthen cooperation between the bureau and the union. Moreover, the union's demands are extremely reasonable. The postal bureau should be open and honest. When we passed through Nanjing, we had earnest consultations with Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua and reached a satisfactory solution. The Hankou postal authorities must deeply recognize the reasonable demands of the union and must not</p>
<p>violate the general will of the people and deviate from the intentions of the party and government authorities, causing the matter to escalate and bear other unforeseen responsibilities." (September 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Li Yizhi Arrives in Kaifeng <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Only One-Tenth of the Yellow River Prevention Funds Received</p>
<p>Li Unwilling to Make Empty Promises About Yellow River Control Plan</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, arrived in Kaifeng from Nanjing today (the 9th) with engineer An Lisheng, staying at the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. Liu Zhi immediately hosted a banquet at the bank at 6 p.m. to welcome him. Those accompanying him included Zhang Jingyu, Director of the Department of Construction, and Li Wenhao, Director of the Department of Finance. Li will go to Lanfeng tomorrow (the 10th) to inspect the Yellow River project, and then go to Beiping and on to Xi'an. According to Li, the Ministry of Finance has only agreed to allocate half of the funds for the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. Now that Minister Song has returned to the country, it may be possible to discuss the matter again. Although the originally allocated temporary prevention wage of 500,000 yuan has only received one-tenth of the sum, it has all been used for the project. However, we must continue to urge for the continued allocation. As for the location of the commission, it was originally planned to be located in Xi'an. Now the authorities of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hebei provinces all advocate that it be located downstream. I also agree very much. However, this issue should pay attention to two starting points, namely Zhengzhou and Xi'an, because the river works below Mengjin should take Zhengzhou as the starting point, while the river works above Mengjin should take Xi'an as the starting point. Li also talked about the fundamental management and guidance plan of the Yellow River, saying that I am now really unwilling to speak out, that is, talking is also empty talk, because fundamental management and guidance should first seek knowledge. Do we people at this time really understand the Yellow River? As far as I personally am concerned, I dare not say that I understand it. For example, the Yellow River suffers from silt, and what kinds of silt are there, and where does the silt come from, we must first know it before we can talk about governance. However, this kind of knowledge work, with a period of three years, should be able to be completed. With another year of work, a fundamental plan can be made. Therefore, I am unwilling to make empty talk at this time. (September 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Principal Offender in Mengcheng Narcotics Case Captured <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>丨To Be Sent to Headquarters for Legal Action丨</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Li Mingxun and Chen Zaihong from Mengcheng, northern Anhui, secretly set up a heroin manufacturing plant in the county. In September of last year, they used three bottom-lined boats to secretly transport 84 packages of narcotics to Bengbu. When the boats were docked downstream, they were seized by the military police inspection office. The case caused a sensation at the time. At the end of November, Garrison Commander Xu Tingyao sent a team to Mengcheng to arrest Chen Zaihong, while Li Mingxun fled upon hearing the news. The Bengbu Garrison Command transferred Chen Zaihong to the Fengyang First Branch of the Anhui High Court for legal action. The court then transferred Chen Zaihong to the Fengyang County Government for interrogation, but Li Mingxun never dared to appear in court and secretly lobbied in various directions. The county government ruled for non-prosecution and released Chen Zaihong. The General Headquarters of the Bandit Suppression Command of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui learned of this and believed that the handling was improper, so they transferred the case file to the headquarters for review. Recently, Geng Dangzi entered and gathered to send the provincial government to Mengcheng to conduct a thorough investigation and capture. On the 8th of this month, Li Mingxun (also known as Li Linge) was arrested, while Chen Zaihong fled without a trace. It is reported that after Li Mingxun was arrested, his party members planned to collude with the Red Spears Society to hijack the case. In addition to notifying the Mengcheng County Government to strengthen prevention, Geng Dangzi also requested that the police be sent to help send Li to the headquarters for legal action.

After the county government ordered the county public security bureau to take custody of him, the county chamber of commerce, the county education association, and the Shanghai native association all telegraphed the province to instruct the county to handle the case in order to warn against illegal activities. On the 11th, Yang Geseng, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, dismissed Jin and sent a document to the county to request investigation. After a brief interrogation by the county, Jin was temporarily released on bail.</p>

<p>Repercussions of Unauthorized Occupation of the Highway</p>
<p>Yuan Zihong, a villager in the Sanfang area near Liqiao in District Three of the county, recently renovated his first-built house and obtained a building permit from the District Three Office. Yu Xunzhen, the district head, did not send anyone to investigate and survey. After obtaining the building permit, Yuan Zihong immediately started construction and encroached on the highway by several feet. Yuan Afu and other villagers learned of this and jointly submitted a request to the county government for an investigation. After receiving the report, the county government immediately instructed the district head to investigate and reply. After receiving the order, District Head Yu summoned Yuan Afu and twelve others to the district, ordered Yuan Zihong to pay 40 yuan to Yuan Afu as highway encroachment fee, and ordered Yuan Zihong to pay 10 yuan to be used as funds for the fire brigade, hoping to settle the matter. However, Yuan Afu refused to accept the silver dollars, so the matter was not resolved. He continued to submit a report to the county government, requesting that Yuan Zihong be ordered to demolish the house that encroached on the highway, and requesting that the district head be dismissed and severely punished until his goal is achieved.</p>

<p>Zhao Baoxing (also known as Zhao Boguan), the grain clerk and grain clerk of the Zizihao Grain Store in Wuqiaoxia Hui Shangzhen outside the North Gate of the county, was previously recommended by Xie Yongnan, the town mayor. However, the grain clerk usually measured land and grain for others, taking money as his guide, reversing right and wrong, and his bad deeds were obvious. Recently, people jointly reported to the county government. After a thorough investigation by County Magistrate Yan, the dismissal order was issued, and he was never allowed to be reinstated. At the same time, the district registers were transferred to the county for archiving.</p>

<p>Elder Brother Conspires to Strangle Younger Brother</p>
<p>Shi Peisheng of Songfeng Village, near Lijiaqiao in District Nine of Wuyi, was addicted to gambling and squandered his family property. Recently, he asked his elder brother, Shi Heshang, to borrow money, saying that he planned to go to Shanghai to find work. Heshang refused. Peisheng immediately used a sharp blade to slash his waterwheel shed. Heshang could not stop him. That night, he discussed with his mother, Shi Yang, to devise a murder. Then, he secretly took a hemp rope and strangled Peisheng in the waterwheel shed at night. The case was detected by the Eighth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to arrest Shi Heshang and Shi Yang, and flew to report to the County Court Procuratorate. The chief procurator, because the case concerned human life, led officials to the countryside for inspection today (the 13th) to pursue the case.</p>

<p>Search and Suppress Coastal Bandits</p>
<p>There is currently an mutinying sea patrol team from Xiaoyangshan, Jiangsu province’s coastal area that has combined with notorious Haizhou gang pirates. They have also colluded with the Jingweiba group of sea bandits on the Zhuangjiasha Beach waters, making their power even greater. The Provincial Security Department has ordered Xu Zaiyu, the captain of the maritime security guerrilla general team, to order the first and second battalions to set out by land and water to suppress and arrest. The waterway will embark from Xinyang Port to the south, and the land route will patrol the coastline to the north, searching and suppressing Jiongfang Port, Lvsi Port, the mouth of the Yellow River, Guanhe Port, Xugou, Qingkou, and other places.</p>

<p>Six grain merchants, including Chen Ruyi and Wei Caichun, each loaded wheat to You, selling it separately to Zhao Hengnan and Xia Chengxing grain stores. They received payment and set sail on the morning of the 9th of this month to purchase grain in Shaobo. Unexpectedly, when passing through Shaobo Lake, they encountered three dragon boats carrying over twenty bandits. The bandits shouted for Chen and the other grain boats to stop. The bandits then pulled out pistols and boarded each boat to rob them. After half an hour, they returned to their original boats and fled. It is said that the six grain boats suffered losses of over two thousand yuan. The victims have reported to the Gao Bao You patrol team, requesting a thorough investigation and arrest.</p>

<p>Red Swastika Society Distributes Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Since the Yellow River dyke broke in Hua County on August 3rd, the floodwaters have spread, with Hua County bearing the brunt. Over six hundred villages have been submerged, extending over a hundred li, with countless human and animal deaths. Material losses have reached over thirty million yuan, a catastrophe unprecedented in Hua County. The Beijing Red Swastika Society, hearing of this terrible news, immediately dispatched team members Hou Zhaoyuan and Wang Lingshen to inspect the disaster area and distribute emergency relief of four hundred yuan in cash and various emergency medicines. They also reported the dire situation to the general headquarters. Currently, Team Leader Yuanyuan and six or seven team members arrived in Hua on September 5th, bringing over three thousand yuan in relief funds and a large quantity of emergency medicines. Early on the 6th, they, together with two local gentry, went to the disaster area to distribute aid. According to the team leader, the funds brought this time are still for emergency relief. It is expected that a large amount of relief funds will continue to arrive soon. Can the three hundred thousand starving and dying disaster victims hope to escape danger?</p>

<p>Mr. Huang Yingbai, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Political Reorganization in Ping, has been in Shanghai for several days, meeting with Finance Minister Song and Mr. Wang Kemin, Director of the Finance Department of the Ping Political Council, to discuss the North China financial problems. He has been extremely busy. Mr. Kong Xiangxi, Governor of the Central Bank, visited Mr. Huang yesterday morning around 10:00 AM and left at 10:40 AM. The meeting between Mr. Kong and Mr. Huang was also related to the North China financial problems. According to reliable sources, a solution has been reached on the North China financial problems. In the future, all national taxes in the North China provinces and cities, except for local taxes, will be directly handed over to the central government. If any provinces or cities have financial difficulties, the central government will assist them. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for reorganizing the North China finances. The North China financial problem has thus come to an end.

<p>Naval Vessels Deployed to Assist in Suppressing Fujian Bandits</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Mr. Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy and Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by train yesterday morning and went to Gaochang Temple to work as usual. Later, when Chen inspected the newly built dock project in Yanpu, reporters approached him and had a conversation. According to him, although he attended the Lushan Conference, there were no major proposals related to the navy. The communist bandits in Fujian Province are rampant, but they have been repelled and the situation is better than before. The navy has two Marine Corps brigades in Fujian, currently participating in the suppression of bandits on the northeastern front lines of Fujian. In the provincial capital and Xiamen, the navy has ten warships, including the Hai Chou, Yong Jian, Yong Xu, Chu Qian, Chu Qin, Jiang Ning, Sui Ning, Wei Ning, Su Ning, and Hai Fu, led by Commander Chen Jiliang to maintain order, so the defense is exceptionally solid and there is no need to worry about unforeseen circumstances. The navy sent students to England, initially more than forty, but they have gradually completed their studies and returned to China. Recently, it was proposed to send more, but Britain refused to continue sending them. It is necessary to contact other countries to send students to study abroad. The Qingdao Navy requested that the central navy notify them in advance when dispatching ships to patrol the North China seas, which is truly perplexing. The central navy still bears the responsibility when there is a lack of naval defense in North China, and dispatches ships to patrol as usual. Therefore, the Tongji is still in the waters off Shandong Province. The Ninghai warship will soon complete its inspection in Shanghai and will sail to Beijing to return to defense within days. The Pinghai project is still proceeding as before. Minister Song returned from overseas, and his luggage had just been unloaded, and there were many accumulated tasks. Although he met with him, he did not discuss the navy's funding with him, and it may take some time to increase the allocation. I will return to Beijing tomorrow or the day after tomorrow (that is, today or tomorrow) after completing the shipyard affairs.</p>

<p>Distressing Report from Jilin</p>
<p>The report made by a special envoy of the former Jilin Provincial Government, Mr. Cheng Yun, has already appeared in previous newspapers. Now we have obtained his latest report, which was forwarded by someone else. We have excerpted it as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e106">Actively Immigrating <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Since Japan seized our Northeast, it has been actively implementing its immigration policy in order to completely occupy the Northeast with Japanese forces and, as the population gradually increases, to force our people to have no place to stand. The first immigrants are Japanese, and the second are Koreans. Most of the immigrants are in the counties of Jilin, Yanji, Wangqing, Shulan, Dunhua, etc., where Koreans are in the majority. Japanese immigrants are mostly in Yilan, Tongjiang, and other counties. It is said that there are also large numbers of colonists in the counties of Liaoning Province, but there are not many colonists in Heilongjiang Province at present. The areas where Japanese immigrants live in the Northeast are all armed with weapons, such as heavy artillery, machine guns, bullets, pistols, etc., to prevent attacks by the Volunteer Army. All Japanese immigrants who have moved into the country have the right to lease land and the right to freely purchase land.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Seizing Real Power <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Currently, all real power in the puppet organization, such as finance, railways, and electricity, is in the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Wherever Japanese power can reach, it penetrates everywhere. In terms of administration, a Japanese councillor is placed in each department. In terms of police administration, a guidance officer is placed. The great power of the puppet officials has been weakened and they are always subject to restrictions. Regarding the currency system, the puppet currency made in Japan is used uniformly, and the people are forced to use it. There is also a so-called Central Bank that issues various amounts of paper money indiscriminately. Today, it is difficult to see Chinese silver dollars and banknotes in large commercial ports or small villages and towns. As a result, commerce is not thriving everywhere. Except for Jilin, Changchun, and Harbin, where the situation is slightly better due to special circumstances, the situation is bleak everywhere else.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Anesthetizing the Masses <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Japan is using the psychology of the Chinese people and loudly advocating the so-called "Royal Way Politics" in the Northeast, saying that true Royal Way Politics will only be seen again in the Northeast in the future. It is also using education as a means of assimilation, adding many hours of Japanese language instruction to all primary and secondary schools, while Chinese characters are listed as an elective subject. In May and July of this year, students from the First Normal School and the First Middle School in Jilin distributed anti-Japanese and national salvation leaflets. The Japanese discovered this and arrested more than thirty students from the two schools, executed more than ten, and the rest were sentenced to lengthy prison terms by the puppet court.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Eliminating Strength <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The self-government organs of counties, districts, and villages in the Northeast have been completely disbanded by the Japanese. Now they are reimplementing the confiscation of civilian weapons, so that the people in the Northeast will never have the power to resist. As for the puppet army, it is mostly reorganized from the troops and bandits disbanded in the Northeast. The so-called Dingguo Army, Huguo Army, and Weiguo Army were disarmed by the Japanese army near Rehe. Currently, the most powerful army of rebels is Zhang Haipeng's army, followed by Yu Zhishan's and Ji Xing's puppet garrison brigades, puppet Jing'an guerrilla teams, and puppet railway guard teams, totaling about 300,000. Since July 1 of this year, Japan has been confiscating a regiment from each brigade of the puppet army. The puppet Jing'an guerrilla team and the puppet railway guard team have each had a company confiscated. The puppet officials who have been disarmed remain in the service of the upper-level Japanese department, still receiving their original salaries, while the soldiers are dismissed. The Japanese army stationed in the Northeast is mostly located in Manzhouli, Suifenhe, and the border areas of Tongren, etc. There are not many stationed in the provinces, cities, and counties. There are about 200 people in Jilin City. Japanese military aircraft fly to various places every day for inspection. At night, there are also aircraft flying in the air over Changchun City to detect movements.</p>
<h3 id="e110">People Have No Means of Livelihood <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>This year, due to favorable weather conditions from spring to summer, the autumn harvest is excellent, especially in Liaoning. The Japanese are all delighted, thinking that they will have land and wealth from now on. However, in reality, it is only the Chinese people who suffer. Taking Jilin Province as an example, since it was invaded and occupied by Japan, all 42 counties have been troubled and uneasy. The worst of these are Panshi, Huadian, and the remote counties in the northeast. According to the land in Panshi County, 80% of it cannot be cultivated because most of the residents have fled elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="e111">War Originates from Economics <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Malai Broadcasts a Speech Advocating Anti-War Principles</p>
<p>The Damei Evening News reports that Lord Malai, the leader of the European representatives of the Anti-War Congress, gave a speech on the principles of the Anti-War Congress on the China Broadcasting Corporation radio station last night (the 12th), which was translated into Chinese and broadcasted successively. The main points of his speech clarified that force cannot solve problems, but will only create other problems that are more difficult to solve. Throughout history, wars have all raised the false mask of self-defense, but in reality, they all originate from economics. The reason why various countries are opposed to the anti-war conference is because they fear that once the inside story of their policies is revealed, they will become the target of attacks from all over the world. This kind of universal evil psychology can be seen in Japan's opposition to the conference. The Japanese are doing their best to oppose it because they fear that their Manchurian policy will be criticized at the conference. In addition, France is opposed to the conference because it fears the exposure of its financial expansion policy and its ambition towards Yunnan. The United States is opposed to the conference because it fears that its policy of promoting trade through missionaries will be noticed. Britain is also unwilling to see the success of the conference because it fears that its interests in Tibet will be valued by others.</p>

<p>Trainer Aircraft to Fly to Shanghai from Peiping Next Week</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Tian Zhi MSG Factory exclusively ordered a fighter plane from the German Junkers factory. After it was shipped to Shanghai for assembly, the German pilot hired by the seller had mediocre skills, causing the propeller and fuel tank to be severely damaged during the test flight. After repeated negotiations between the Tian Zhi factory and the seller, all the damaged parts were replaced. At the same time, the Junkers factory delivered a fully metal trainer aircraft, which it was transporting to China for sale, to the Tian Zhi factory at no cost, to compensate for the interest on the paid price. Therefore, the matter was resolved. Now, according to the spokesperson of the Tian Zhi factory, the newly shipped parts have been telegraphed to the German factory by the Chanson Foreign Firm to expedite the shipment to Shanghai for assembly. It is expected that the parts can be shipped to Shanghai for modification by the end of October. At that time, after the assembly is completed, the company will still have to perform the test flight procedures in accordance with the original contract and formally deliver the goods. Therefore, the naming ceremony of the Tian Zhi aircraft will have to be postponed until the end of October or the beginning of November. As for the trainer aircraft compensated for interest, it has been completed in Beiping. The factory has sent a letter to the aviation school via the aviation administration, asking them to send personnel to drive it to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai within the next week. It is also learned that the factory intends to donate the trainer aircraft to the aviation association's flight club for the training of aviation specialists.</p>

<p>China Electric Company Donates 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Hua Yang Relief Association regarded the Yellow River breach and flooding as a major event. In addition to sending special commissioners to conduct on-site investigations, it held a special board meeting at 2:00 PM on the 12th. Those present were Song Hanzhang, Gu Jisheng, Wang Yiting, Lu Bohong, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Hanzhi, Zhu Yinjiang, Lu Weiyong, Zhang Xianqing, Wang Junsheng, and Chen Liangyu. The Western directors were Fei Wusheng and Jin Han, lawyers. The general secretary, etc., reported on the telegrams and letters of solicitation from various parties, and stated that according to the reports of the investigating commissioners, the Yellow River breach spread to the banks of the four provinces of Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu. The people affected by the flood all fled to the top of the dikes, without anything. They were in imminent danger. Not only is emergency relief urgently needed now, but also it is feared that in the cold winter, the hungry and desperate will become more numerous, making it difficult to overcome this difficult time. All those present were moved by this. It was publicly decided that the association would join the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for the Yellow River Flood Disaster to jointly provide assistance. At the same time, it would raise relief funds and proceed quickly. Winter relief must also be considered. As for the tidal disaster in Chuansha, it was also decided to jointly distribute grain and medicine with the China Jisheng Association. Mr. Lu Bohong personally delivered 3,000 yuan donated by the Shanghai China Electric Company for the water disasters in the northern and southern provinces of the Yellow River. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To the directors: The water disasters in the northern and southern provinces of the Yellow River are extensive and the disaster situation is serious, which is really pitiful. We have always admired your association for handling relief affairs in a practical and realistic manner, without wasting funds. Therefore, the company is sending 3,000 yuan to help with the relief. We know that this is just a drop in the bucket, but it is just a small expression of our intentions. Please issue a receipt for the funds."</p>

<p>Because Magistrate Li of Chuansha County sent a letter repeatedly requesting relief for the disastrous situation in the county, the China Jisheng Association has now investigated and found that the disaster situation is indeed serious. It has publicly elected Mr. Mu Jialiang as the director to purchase 1,000 shi of relief rice, as well as new and old cotton clothing, medicines, etc., and will immediately go to distribute them with the relief workers. It has also received 3,000 yuan from the Hua Yang Relief Association for relief in Chuansha, 600 bottles each of large and small Zhengyao water, and 1,200 yuan from the Xinwei Relief Association. Mr. Lu Wenzhong of the Lianyi Benevolent Society donated a total of 712 bottles of large and small sha medicine water, which will be transported for relief. However, there are many disaster victims, and the small relief cannot be popularized. It is hoped that charitable comrades will pity this tragic disaster, form a benevolent alliance, and donate more funds to eliminate the catastrophe.</p>

<p>Land Prices in the Northern and Southern Districts are Depressed, with the Western District Expected to Rise</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that land prices in Shanghai have fluctuated greatly due to the impact of the January 28th Incident. In order to understand the land price situation in the city, the National Federation of Commerce has specially requested Mr. Pan Wen'an of the China Credit Information Bureau to conduct a personal investigation. The reporter was shown the investigation report by Mr. Pan yesterday. Excerpts are as follows. The investigations of various industries in Shanghai after the war, which were published in various newspapers yesterday, were also conducted by Mr. Pan.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Two Concessions <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The areas where land prices in Shanghai have risen the fastest are Avenue Joffre, Route Conty, and Route Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession, and Avenue Edward VII in the British Concession. Today, it is difficult to purchase not only large pieces of land in these areas, but also small, scattered pieces. This is because the market in this area has suddenly flourished in recent years, and tram transportation has been expanded, so the sharp rise in land prices is to be expected. In the vicinity of Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road in the British Concession, the market has been prosperous for many years, and land prices have risen to a considerable extent, so it seems unlikely that there will be another sharp increase. It is said that the Public Works Department plans to formulate a unified land price list to prohibit free increases.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Northern and Southern Districts <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>In the Chinese areas, such as Dongmen Road in Xiaodongmen and Heping Road in Ximen, the rate of increase has also been rapid. The triangular wasteland next to the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower in Ximen, with an area of only seven or eight mu, sold for as much as 300,000 taels. However, the situation in the city is different from that in the concessions. Whenever the situation is slightly affected, the residents of the Chinese area tend to move to the concessions. At that time, the real estate prices in the Chinese area will immediately show a downward trend. During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, traffic inside and outside the border was cut off for as long as two months, and land prices in the Chinese area suddenly fell sharply. Since the signing of the armistice agreement, land prices have rebounded slightly, but most buyers are still hesitant and unwilling to move forward. This is the main reason for the recent depression in the real estate industry in the Chinese area. Due to the past war disasters, land transactions in Zhabei are very scarce, so there is no formal market price. It is said that it is at least 30% to 40% lower than before the war. The land near Zhangjia Lane on Wuhua Road used to be worth five or six thousand taels per mu, but now it is worth four or five thousand taels, which is not very different. However, in the area along Yongxing Road, the price has dropped from three or four thousand taels to only two thousand taels. Recently, there have been transactions in the bustling area along Baoshan Road, but the price paid is also 30% to 40% lower than before the war. However, west of Meiyuan Road, the land price has only decreased to a limited extent compared to before the war.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Eastern and Western Districts <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>In the year before the January 28th Incident, factories sprang up in Yangshupu like mushrooms after a rain, and land prices soared. Land prices in the central district also increased significantly, but slightly less than in the eastern district. The western district did not show much progress in the first half of the twentieth year. Since the opening of negotiations on the construction of roads across the border, domestic and foreign attention has been focused on this area, which is considered to be the only area for expansion. Moreover, after the General Assembly purchased Xiangmao Villa, the neighboring landowners thought that the time had come, so they raised the land prices. In fact, transactions were very scarce. This year, land prices in the western district are still firm, while transactions in the eastern district are still few, and all are buying factory sites without speculation. Since the signing of the Tanggu Agreement, there has been a slight increase in activity. From the perspective of the overall trend, the rise in land prices in the area will eventually be realized sooner or later. There are four reasons for this: (1) The construction of the municipal government building has been completed. If the city center construction plan can be implemented step by step, land prices will inevitably rise. (2) After the increase in tariffs on imported goods, imports will decrease. Chinese people are gradually thinking of setting up factories to manufacture goods that were previously imported from overseas. Foreign companies are also planning to set up factories in China to manufacture due to the increased tariffs and high costs. The only suitable location for setting up factories is the eastern district. (3) Since the signing of the Tanggu Agreement, the relationship between China and Japan has gradually eased. Japanese companies are also planning to set up factories in China to avoid transportation problems. The location is also in the Jiangwan area. (4) The two-railway stations are planned to be moved to Jiangwan to connect with the port. If this can be realized, the land prices in the vicinity will definitely rise.</p>

<p>The Yungang Grottoes in Datong were built in the early years of the Wei Dynasty and took more than 100 years to complete, with more than 10,000 stone Buddhas. Each of the larger ones is more than forty zhang tall, magnificent and solemn, and treasured by the world. They are a unique achievement in the history of art in our country. Recent reports say they have been destroyed by Zhao Chengzhou's troops. Cai Yuanpei, Ye Gongchao, and Liu Haisu of the Chinese Archaeological Society telegraphed Yan Xishan yesterday, saying, "To Mr. Yan Xishan of Taiyuan, Shanxi: Reports say the Yungang Grottoes in Datong have been destroyed by Commander Zhao Chengzhou's troops. It is regrettable that world-renowned antiquities are being destroyed in this way. Please strictly order their protection and restoration and prohibit any infringement.

<p>The itinerary for Mr. Xi and his party's survey of the disaster area has been decided to be three days. On the first day, they will depart from Beijing, pass through Tongshan, Fengxian, and other counties, and arrive in Jinan. They will stay in Jinan overnight. On the second day (the 14th), they will take off from Jinan, pass through Puyang and Heze, and arrive in Kaifeng. On the third day (the 15th), they will fly east from Kaifeng, passing through Chenliu and Lanfeng, and return to Beijing. As for their mission, in addition to inspecting the disaster situation along the way and taking photos, they must also discuss relief matters with the authorities in the disaster areas, so as to report to the committee and decide on the steps to implement disaster relief. Therefore, as soon as Mr. Xi and his party complete their inspection, they will return to Shanghai and report the details of the inspection and the opinions of the authorities in the disaster areas on relief, so that a relief plan can be decided as soon as possible to save the disaster victims.</p>

<p>Minister Chen and Mayor Wu Specially Invited to Officiate at the Unveiling Ceremony</p>
<p>The National Goods Movement Exhibition in this city has been actively preparing since being initiated by the First Special District Citizens' Federation, the China National Products Manufacturers Federation, etc. The opening ceremony was originally scheduled for the 9th of this month. However, the Fire Prevention Division of the Public Security Bureau deemed the facilities non-compliant and ordered a halt. The reed fences were replaced with wooden boards to prevent unforeseen circumstances, so it could not be held as scheduled. After a meeting, all participating manufacturers decided to comply and postpone the opening to 2:00 PM on the 15th (i.e., tomorrow) to allow for unhurried arrangements. The exhibition venue is located in the southwest of the Penglai Market on Penglai Road. Since yesterday, participating manufacturers have been drawing lots for their locations and starting construction. Throughout the night, caretaking and directing personnel from each factory, along with artisans, are working as usual, actively rushing to complete preparations by tomorrow morning. The artisans are currently intensifying their efforts. The organizers believe that this exhibition is of great importance to the future of national goods, so Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry* and Mayor Wu have been specially invited to officiate at the unveiling ceremony to make it grand. Invitations have also been sent to various agencies and organizations to attend the ceremony, and entertainment will be provided to enhance the occasion. The organizers have also requested the Security Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to maintain order at the venue. The original texts of the letters and telegrams sent by the organizers to Minister Chen and Mayor Wu are as follows: (1) Telegram to the Ministry of Industry (titles abbreviated): "The affiliated associations, to encourage production and promote national goods, have specifically scheduled the opening ceremony for 2:00 PM on the [deleted] afternoon. This move is related to the production growth and decline of the entire country and has been approved by the party and government organs for record. We respectfully request your esteemed presence at the meeting to hold the unveiling ceremony and provide guidance on everything to encourage and promote propaganda.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying: "According to an order from the Ministry of Industry, the Hankou Municipal National Goods Movement Committee reported that Standing Committee Member Wang Heqing stated that most trademarks of domestic factory products are described in English, making it difficult to distinguish national goods from foreign goods, which has a significant impact on the sales of national goods. It is proposed that the Ministry of Industry forward this to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering all manufacturers that, in the future, products sold domestically should uniformly use the national language, while those sold abroad should use Chinese as the main language and foreign languages for translation, in order to uphold the national system and facilitate identification. The indiscriminate use of English mixes domestic and foreign goods, making it impossible to distinguish national goods, which has a significant impact on promoting national goods and expanding production and sales. Therefore, all national goods sold domestically in the future should quickly switch to using Chinese descriptions to show distinction and facilitate sales." Therefore, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau orders the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to instruct all national goods factories to comply. This order is hereby issued.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Resolution of the Fuxin Factory's Lease of Railway Bureau Spur Track Case <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Signing of Nine Supplementary Contracts</p>
<p>Contract Valid for Ten Years - Xin Xin News Agency reports that in the autumn of the fifteenth year of the Republic, the Fuxin Flour Mill requested the Railway Bureau to lay a spur track from the three-mile point of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to the front of the factory's freight station on Xiaoshadu Road for its lease. The Railway Bureau built it, and on December 1 of that year, the two parties signed a contract with fourteen clauses. However, disputes arose soon after implementation, causing losses to both sides. Now, the Railway Bureau believes that the prolonged delay of this case not only affects railway revenue but also violates the purpose of the railway to circulate goods. After detailed consideration, on the 5th of this month, it signed nine supplementary contracts with the Fuxin Flour Mill to resolve the issue. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter has recorded the contracts signed before and after the case and the process as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e136">Original Contract <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Contractors: Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration (hereinafter referred to as the "Railway Bureau"), Fuxin Flour Mill (hereinafter referred to as the "Fuxin Factory"). The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has approved the request of the Fuxin Flour Mill to build a branch line to reach the factory and has stipulated the following rules: (1) The branch line shall start from the three-mile point of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and reach the outside of the Fuxin Factory. The Railway Bureau shall be responsible for the construction, and the Fuxin Factory shall be allowed to use the branch line in accordance with the following regulations. (2) The Fuxin Factory shall pay 3,000 silver dollars for various expenses of the Railway Bureau in building the branch line on the factory's land, such as filling earth, ditches, labor costs, and supervision fees for managing this work. All materials required for building the branch line shall be borrowed and repaired by the Railway Bureau in accordance with the provisions of Article 3. (3) The Railway Bureau shall charge 12% of the original value of the building materials borrowed by the Fuxin Factory each year as rent. This fee shall include annual road maintenance fees and shall be collected starting from the date of completion of the road. (4) The Fuxin Factory shall deposit 5,000 silver dollars with the Railway Bureau. This amount shall be refunded by the Railway Bureau when the freight value of the branch line reaches 20,000 yuan per year. At any time, if the Fuxin Factory does not continue to use this branch line and the freight value has not reached the above amount, the deposit shall be forfeited by the Railway Bureau, and all materials shall be retrieved by the Railway Bureau. (5) In addition to freight and other fees that shall be paid in accordance with regulations, each car entering the branch line shall be charged a switching fee based on the car's capacity, calculated from the starting point of the branch line, at 2.5 cents per ton per kilometer. (6) The collection of fees for vehicle and tarpaulin delays shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Railway Bureau. (7) At any time, if there are empty spaces on the branch line, the Railway Bureau shall have the right to use them for dispatching vehicles. (8) The Railway Bureau shall have the right to lay other branch lines to connect with this branch line if it deems it feasible. (9) The Railway Bureau and the Fuxin Factory shall each be responsible for losses incurred by either party's staff due to negligence or errors in performing their duties on the branch line and shall bear the compensation for the party suffering the loss. (10) The Fuxin Factory shall hand over the cars loaded with goods waiting to be transported on the branch line to the Railway Bureau at the time designated by the Railway Bureau. (11) If the Railway Bureau deems it necessary, the Fuxin Factory shall build gates and fences at the boundary of the Railway Bureau in accordance with the instructions of the Railway Bureau's engineer for protection purposes. (12) During the validity period of the contract, the Fuxin Factory shall transport all of its goods through the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau. This transportation shall be in the name of the Fuxin Flour Mill and shall not be handled by a transportation company. (13) If the Fuxin Flour Mill fails to make payments on time and exceeds the deadline by more than 30 days, the Railway Bureau shall have the right to seize the factory's goods and other movable property on the branch line in accordance with the law to compensate for the loss. (14) The contract shall be valid for ten years. After that, the Railway Bureau or the Fuxin Factory shall make other regulations twelve months before the expiration of the contract.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Course of the Dispute <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The above contract was signed by Fuxin First Factory, but at the time, the factory's original intention was to include Maoxin and Shenxin factories. The branch track was also shared by the three factories. However, according to Article 12 of the contract, it seemed that other than Fuxin, Maoxin and Shenxin were not applicable. Therefore, disputes arose soon after implementation. Later, workers on Maigen Road, on the pretext that the goods transported into the branch track did not belong to Fuxin First Factory, forcibly detained them at the Maizhan station, preventing them from being dropped into the branch track for unloading, resulting in a major dispute. Fuxin Factory's one-time loss reached more than 7,000 yuan. Subsequently, in the 19th and 20th years of the Republic, it repeatedly requested the Railway Bureau to amend the contract, but it remained unresolved for a long time. The goods of the Fuxin, Maoxin, and Shenxin factories were all switched to waterway transportation to Shanghai. At the same time, the rent for the branch track was also stopped, accumulating to more than 6,700 yuan to date. Repeated demands for payment were met with the excuse that the Railway Bureau refused to amend the contract and that the branch track was useless, so payment was refused. The Railway Bureau believes that the prolonged delay of this case not only affects railway revenue but also violates the purpose of the railway to circulate goods. After detailed consideration, it believes that (1) the branch track has been invested in and built by the railway and should be fully utilized to directly facilitate passenger transport for loading and unloading goods and indirectly develop the social economy and regulate people's livelihoods; (2) the contract conditions should be based on mutual benefit; (3) in order to save the declining freight transport, the railway should work with major industrialists to promote progress. Based on this purpose, it began negotiations with Fuxin Factory in March of this year and drafted nine supplementary contracts, which were submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. However, considering that the current freight transport is in decline, after detailed consultation, it was proposed to use the branch track to attract freight transport for the railway, and the fifth supplementary contract was supplemented. All merchant goods are not restricted from loading and unloading on the branch track. Subsequently, instructions were received to approve the supplementary measures for a one-year trial. With the consent of the Fuxin Flour Mill, it was officially signed and established on September 5. The Railway Bureau then issued a written certificate of the supplementary measures and notified the Traffic and Accounting Departments. At this point, the case was finally concluded. The signed clauses of the supplementary contracts are published below:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Supplementary Clauses <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Contractors: Jinghu Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration (hereinafter referred to as the "Railway Bureau"), Fuxin Flour Mill (hereinafter referred to as the "Fuxin Factory"). With the consent of both parties, the supplementary clauses to the contract signed on December 1 of the 15th year of the Republic are hereby stipulated as follows: Article 1: The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration mentioned in the original contract shall be changed to the Jinghu Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration from the date of signing of this supplementary contract.

<h3 id="e139">Bei Songsun Lectures on the Silver Issue <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Invited by the International Issues Research Association</p>
<p>Mr. Bei Songsun of the Bank of China accompanied Minister Song to various countries in Europe and America to attend the World Economic Conference and made remarkable achievements. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his duties. The International Issues Research Association specially invited Mr. Bei to lecture on the silver issue at the Bank Club at 5:00 PM on the 11th of this month. Guo Bingwen, Zou Bingwen, Xu Xinliu, Chen Liting, Li Zhaohuan, Cao Yunxiang, Chen Zheqing, and members Cai Wuji, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jilong, Wu Liande, Chen Lingyi, Huang Renzhi, and dozens of others attended. Chairman Guo Bingwen first stood up to give a speech, saying in brief: "It is a great honor to have Mr. Bei present today to give a lecture. Mr. Bei accompanied Minister Song to attend the World Economic Conference and worked extremely hard. I would like to express my condolences on behalf of this association and ask Mr. Bei to share his experiences abroad to increase the knowledge of my colleagues." Bei then thanked him and began his lecture on the silver issue. His speech was as follows: We want to</p>
<h3 id="e140">discuss the silver issue <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>we must first talk about the reasons for the drop in silver prices. There are only two reasons for this: first, it is related to politics, and second, it is due to the recession. We know that when silver prices rise, commodity prices rise accordingly, and when silver prices fall, commodity prices also fall. This is because although silver is one type of commodity, it is still used as currency in several countries. However, this rule may sometimes change, such as in the special circumstances of the European War. However, silver prices are always</p>
<h3 id="e141">a barometer of commodity prices <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>In 1896, the United States also experienced a major turmoil due to the recession. At that time, Pola Boyal advocated the free minting of gold and silver coins, with a ratio of silver to gold of sixteen to one, and the Democratic presidential candidate referred to it as the Free Coinage Campaign. Later, in 1899, people began to feel the shortage of gold. According to the report of the League of Nations Gold Committee, if the gold mines of Alaska had not been discovered, the world's gold would have been insufficient to allocate. After the European War, countries worked hard to increase production, but at first, due to wartime losses, everyone tried to replenish supplies, and goods still had a market. Later, more and more goods accumulated, and commodity prices also fell. So everyone tried to push the goods abroad, causing</p>
<h3 id="e142">international trade war <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>leading to the global recession we see today. Secondly, why are silver prices related to politics? Since the United Kingdom reduced the silver content of its subsidiary coins, countries have followed suit. India also imitated it from 1926 based on the report of the Royal Commission of that year. It gradually withdrew the Robi circulating in the market and successively sold off its silver bullion reserves. Between 1929 and 1932, silver prices fell uncontrollably. At that time,</p>
<h3 id="e143">had a great impact on our country <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Economic research conclusion</p>
<p>As a result, it was proposed to prohibit the import of silver, but in order to maintain international trade, our government expressed its opposition. However, at that time, a letter was sent to the Indian government, hoping that they would change their silver sales policy. At the same time, the year with the highest silver production was 1929, with as much as 262.2 million ounces. On the one hand, due to the recession, the sales of silver decreased. On the other hand, due to the sales by various governments and the increase in silver production, silver prices naturally fell further and further, and the voice of maintaining silver prices became higher and higher. The American people seem to have a special affection for silver. In fact, the amount of silver produced in the United States is still below that of Mexico. It is said that it is due to</p>
<h3 id="e144">historical relationship <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>became a kind of superstition, so it was taken very seriously at this meeting, and opinions from experts were sought in many ways. As a result, it was felt that there was a real need to maintain silver prices. At the London conference, the United States proposed three steps to maintain silver prices. First, currency should still be used gold. The second way is to save the use of gold. Countries using gold can only use gold as a reserve and for insufficient international trade. On one side, recover gold stored by the people. Those who must use gold for industry must apply to the government for permission and purchase it from the market. The delivery must be made through the central banks of various countries. Third, the central bank's cash reserve is reduced to 25%, of which 20% is used for gold and 5% can be used for silver, but the silver purchased should be equal to other commodity prices. This plan is very much related to maintaining silver prices.</p>
<h3 id="e145">As for currency inflation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>although to raise commodity prices</p>
<p>one of the strategies, but if there is no actual market for various goods, the price increase will be temporary and contains great dangers. In the Washington talks, the United States had already discussed this plan with several countries. Although there was generally no objection, countries such as Britain and France felt that the addition of silver to the reserve still needed to be considered. In terms of raising silver prices, there were two sides to the debate at the time. One side thought it would affect our country's exports, and the other side thought it would benefit our country and increase purchasing power. The US authorities questioned our country's representatives at the time, and the answer at the time was that if commodity prices rise, silver prices will naturally rise, but it is hoped that silver prices will not be higher than all commodity prices, and the principle is to be equivalent to general commodity prices, and at the same time, it is hoped that there will be a way to stabilize silver prices. The silver issue is in,</p>
<h3 id="e146">&lt;Changing Opening Hours&gt; <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The original opening hours of the hospital, as stipulated, were from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily. It is now decided to revise the opening hours from the 16th of this month to 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM. After installing more electric lights in the East Wing, a night clinic will be opened from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Customs Clerk Embezzlement Case Indicted</p>
<p>Completed after Two Months of Investigation</p>
<p>The Entire Process of Investigation Has Just Begun</p>
<p>Shi Cunqiao, a customs clerk at the Jianghai Customs, and others, along with Su Kunnian and 999 others who established the "Slick Reporting Customs Brokerage Co.," colluded with customs brokers from various foreign firms to forge customs declarations when reporting taxes, embezzling huge sums of customs duties, totaling hundreds of thousands. These funds were distributed among multiple parties. Due to continuous losses, the Customs Office instructed the water police to investigate. After a lengthy investigation by Western Detective Pang Shi, Deputy Detective Shu Bo, Chinese Detectives Cheng Shaonian and Wang Haiquan, this major case was uncovered. Su Kunnian, Shi Cunqiao, and six others were arrested. As a result of the interrogations, Su Kunnian, Shi Cunqiao, and others confessed to their past actions and were handed over to the local court. Subsequently, the prosecutor's office conducted a detailed investigation over two months, issued arrest warrants for the remaining accomplices. The investigation procedures have only now been completed. The prosecution has cited charges including document forgery and embezzlement, requesting severe penalties. The indictments were delivered separately on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Bomb Found at Swimming Pool Explodes, Injuring People</p>
<p>Westerners Discussed the European War Upon Seeing the Bomb</p>
<p>Unexpected Carelessness Led to the Bombing Incident</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at approximately 9:30 AM, a Western manager named Dian of the open-air swimming pool at 25 Jiangwan Road, together with lifeguard Wu Wenhao, age 22, from Hangzhou, were inspecting the perimeter of the pool when they suddenly found a bomb, about the size of a bowl. The Westerner picked up the bomb and stood talking with Wu about the situation of the European War. Unexpectedly and carelessly, the bomb fell to the ground with a loud explosion. Wu's chest was injured in the explosion, and he collapsed to the ground. The Westerner suffered injuries to his arms, chest, feet, and other areas, sustaining more serious wounds. Colleagues transported the Westerner to Gongji Hospital, and Wu was transferred to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Resolution on the Property Rights of the Jing'an Temple</p>
<p>Confirming the Temple as a Public Monastery</p>
<p>Buddhist Association Calls for Representative Elections</p>
<p>Contracts and Judgments to be Revoked</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Heping News Agency: The Jing'an Temple in this city is one of the public monasteries. The Shanghai County Chronicles and various Buddhist scriptures all record this. During the Red Turban Rebellion, monks scattered, and the temple was transformed into a tonsure lineage temple. After the founding of the Republic, the two factions disputed the position of abbot, filing lawsuits against each other. Subsequently, disputes arose over jurisdiction and property rights, initially involving jurisdictional disputes between the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government, then transferred to the Provisional Court. After legal proceedings, the issues further involved mortgages and disputes with the British firm Cowen. For over a decade, no appropriate resolution was reached. After Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong took office, in order to seek a thorough solution, he, along with the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs, dispatched senior officials to conduct on-site investigations. They determined that the temple was a public monastery and that the temple property could not be disposed of or altered without authorization. All contracts signed with foreign merchants were to be revoked. This was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The decades-long dispute over the temple property and the abbot's position finally reached a resolution. Details obtained from various sources are recorded below.</p>
<p>Factional Disputes</p>
<p>According to investigations by officials and the Buddhist Association, the Jing'an Temple was built during the reign of Emperor Da of Wu, and throughout the Tang and Song dynasties, it was a renowned scenic spot in Shanghai. Historical records indicate that it was always a public monastery. During the Taiping Rebellion, most of the monks fled, and the temple was changed from a public monastery to a tonsure lineage temple (i.e., a family lineage). In 1915, after the death of Abbot Zheng Sheng, his disciples Xue Gen and Liu Gen were accused by Lin Zhi Zhou, Yao Zhi Ting, and others before the Shanghai County Government and the former Mixed Court for violating monastic rules. The County Government agreed to the Buddhist Association President Monk Chang Gui and local monks establishing a supervisory committee to protect the temple's property. However, the disputes continued. In the winter of 1922, representatives from various local communities organized a monastic affairs conference, formally deciding that the temple should remain a public monastery. Monk Xin Ru (i.e., Gu Yun) was selected as the abbot, and Monk Yang Xi was appointed as the general representative of various mountains to supervise the abbot. This was submitted to the Mixed Court for judgment, and the temple's property documents were placed in the custody of the Mixed Court's prosecutor's office, permanently prohibiting their mortgage or sale. The abbot was recognized as having management rights but not ownership rights. Subsequently, Yao Wen Zuo of the Shanghai Buddhist Association and Hui Ji, the abbot of Qinglong Temple, argued that the Mixed Court's judgment of Monk Xin Ru inheriting the abbotship violated custom and that the嫡系僧志汶嫡系僧 Zhiwen should inherit the abbotship. They claimed that this was an administrative decision and not within the purview of the Mixed Court. As a result, they filed complaints with the provincial and central governments for several years. The former Jiangsu Provincial Governor instructed the former Shanghai Circuit Office to investigate and reply, stating that the former Mixed Court's judgment that it was a public monastery was still appropriate and should be maintained. After the National Revolutionary Army stabilized Jiangsu, representatives from various mountains publicly nominated Monk Ji Shan in May 1927, which was approved by the Shanghai Political Sub-Committee for registration.</p>
<p>Donation of 100,000</p>
<p>After his failure, the tonsure lineage monk Zhiwen secretly applied to the Shanghai Provisional Court for a preliminary injunction. He led monks, lay followers, and police, armed, to take over as abbot. Fearing that the public monastery faction might not accept this, he submitted a request to the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department in August, willing to donate 100,000 yuan. The Civil Affairs Department then confirmed that the monk had inherited the abbotship, deeming it in accordance with the amended regulations for managing temples. It determined that temples in the concessions were not the same as civil or criminal cases and were not subject to interference. The temple's property should be registered with the local government. He was praised for understanding the big picture, and the reply was gently worded. A notice was sent to the Provincial Government, and a copy was sent to the Judiciary Department and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their information. Subsequently, a letter was sent to the Shanghai Provisional Court, requesting the return of the documents of preliminary attachment submitted by the former Abbot Xin Ru.</p>
<p>Sale to British Merchants</p>
<p>At the same time, the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department appointed Xiang Kangyuan to go to Shanghai to retrieve these documents and sign three contracts with the British merchant Cowen. Xiang Kangyuan, Guo Yu Ruo, Zhiwen, and Yang Xi sealed them and used the name Chang Guan Ru. Through the Tongyi Trust Company, they agreed to sell 54 mu of land for a price of 180,000 yuan, which was later increased to 400,000 yuan. The property deeds were transferred for handover. The Municipal Government believed that the monk had deceived the government officials and secretly sold the temple property at a reduced price. It sent urgent telegrams to the Civil Affairs Department to stop the sale, but to no avail. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, based on a resolution of the political affairs meeting, instructed the Civil Affairs Department to handle the matter and reported it to the National Government for record. Subsequently, Commissioner Kong Qingzhang was appointed to join Xiang Kangyuan in inventorying the temple property and securing donations. Various parties then rose up in opposition. The Municipal Government also telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission, strongly advocating for a thorough investigation. The Military Affairs Commission dispatched Hu Renqing to Shanghai to assist in the handling. However, the Municipal Government insisted on establishing a committee for inventorying the temple property and reporting to the National Government for review. Subsequently, the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department submitted a proposal to the Provincial Government for reconsideration. The Provincial Government decided that the Shanghai Concession was still within the administrative system of the Provincial Government and that it was not necessary to establish another committee for handling the matter. It also reported to the National Government that the Municipal Government's establishment of another committee was insincere. Finally, in January 1928, the National Government meeting resolved to transfer the matter to the Ministry of Finance for handling. This would both provide military funding and resolve the disputes between the province and the municipality.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Measures</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, since receiving the order to resolve the temple's disputes, has explored three options, which are recorded below: (1) The temple should be confirmed as a public monastery; (2) Retain real estate outside of the temple, sold in parts through mortgage sales, to allocate 100,000 yuan for military funding. The remaining funds will be used to purchase Second Five National Treasury Bonds; (3) All purchased treasury bonds should be handed over to the Provincial Government or its designated agencies as a foundation for academic and religious research. The Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Provincial Government to consult, appointing representatives from the Provincial Government and various parties to establish a Jing'an Temple Property Disposal Committee at the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office, but no progress was made. In April 1929, the Municipal Government again submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, stating the difficulties in handling the case. The Executive Yuan forwarded it to the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs, ordering the Jiangsu Commissioner for Foreign Affairs to instruct the Bureau of Measurement and Registration of Leased Land to prevent the sale, but the disputes remained unresolved.</p>
<p>Resolution Pathways</p>
<p>Interior Minister Huang Shao-xiong, since receiving the order from the Executive Yuan, together with Foreign Minister Luo Wen-gan, after researching and investigating the long-standing disputes, decided on three measures. The original text is recorded below: (1) Regarding the issue of jurisdictional authority, the reason for the reporting of disputes by both parties is that the scope of the temple's affiliation has not been determined. Currently, according to the regulations for supervising temples, the so-called competent government agency is naturally the Shanghai Municipal Government; (2) Regarding the issue of the abbot's faction, records and documents indicate that the temple is a public monastery, which is credible. Although it temporarily changed to a tonsure private transmission system during the Taiping Rebellion, the monastery system was restored in 1922 and was reported to the former Shanghai Mixed Court, the Shanghai Political Sub-Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, it should be maintained, and the temple should be permanently designated as a public monastery. This designation should be inscribed on a tablet in front of the temple to ensure its longevity. All cases of Zhiwen applying to the former Shanghai Provisional Court for judgment and the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department approving嫡系僧徒嫡系僧 disciples to be abbots should be fundamentally revoked. The Shanghai Buddhist Association should promptly convene representatives from various mountains in Shanghai to publicly elect a monk of high moral character to be the abbot of the temple; (3) Regarding the issue of disposing of temple property, the use of temple property should comply with the regulations for supervising temples. Zhiwen's previous application to sell temple property and donate funds for military use was purely a matter of personal gain under the guise of public service. The Civil Affairs Department was deceived. Regardless of the content of the contract, it was ultimately an act of fraud. Moreover, its payment and transfer were conditional on the transfer of property deeds. Since the property deeds have not been transferred, the condition has not been met, and there is no legal effect. It should be revoked entirely. The temple's property and religious items should be thoroughly inventoried by the abbot elected by the Shanghai Municipal Government and registered according to regulations. In the future, they may not be disposed of or altered without authorization.</p>
<p>Government Approval</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior, after deciding on the three measures, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review. The following is the directive: "Regarding the former submission by this Ministry concerning the review of various cases of disputes over the property of Jing'an Temple in Shanghai, which have been referred for verification and the proposal of solutions, it was reported to the Yuan. It was referred to the Ministry of Finance for verification and reply. Now, according to the reply, this case falls within the scope of jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior. The files that have been stored in this Ministry over the years have been sent to the Ministry of Interior for handling. Since this Ministry has proposed appropriate solutions for the issues of jurisdictional authority, the abbot's faction, and the disposal of temple property, this Ministry also agrees. Therefore, the solutions proposed by this Ministry should be approved. In addition to notifying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and reporting to the National Government for review, this order is hereby issued to the Ministry to promptly implement it." This order indicates that after the case was submitted by the Ministry of Interior and approved by the Executive Yuan, a notice was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government for verification and handling. The decades-long unresolved case has now been appropriately resolved.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Riot at the Train Station</p>
<p>The Stationmaster Detained, Employees Beaten</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday, at the Xinlonghua Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the No. 703 freight train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, with five cars attached carrying wounded soldiers from the No. 16 Rear Hospital from Beijing to Hangzhou, arrived at Xinlonghua Station. The train's engine was damaged and could not move, so it had to wait for assistance at the station. However, when the wounded soldiers saw that the train was not moving, they immediately swarmed off the train, numbering about a hundred. They rushed to the stationmaster's office, grabbed the duty stationmaster, Guan Jiayou, and forced him to depart immediately, threatening to kill him if he did not. While they were cursing, a Shanghai-Hequ district commuter train from Shangnan Station passed by. The wounded soldiers wanted to detach the commuter train's small engine and attach it to their car to drive to Hangzhou. Stationmaster Guan tried to persuade them, explaining that the small engine did not have enough coal and water and could not travel a long distance. However, the wounded soldiers ignored him, punching and kicking him and all the station's workers. At that time, the station's police chief, Xu Shibin, saw the dangerous situation and immediately led the police officers to rescue the stationmaster and other employees, using gentle words to comfort the wounded soldiers. The wounded soldiers ignored them and cursed and beat the police chief, and also stole the stationmaster's signal flag and route sign. The entire station was temporarily unable to work. Fortunately, the police chief and others secretly dispatched police officers to guard the offices, telegraphs, telephones, and other places. They continued to protect the stationmaster and others from being injured by the wounded soldiers. They also tried to negotiate with the wounded soldiers' nurse team leader, He Shifu, no matter what, not to injure the stationmaster. If they saw an engine, they would give them priority to depart. As a result, the team leader released the stationmaster. At 3:20 PM, the Beijing-Zhabei express train passed by. The wounded soldiers again forced it to leave, attaching five cars of wounded soldiers and driving away, finally resolving the matter. The station immediately telegraphed its superiors for instructions and asked them to inform the military authorities in charge to strictly prohibit such incidents. The stationmaster reported to the First Police Section, which reported to the Lianglu Police Department for instructions.</p>
<p>Thieves Divinding Loot, Detectives Rush to Arrest</p>
<p>Five Thieves Apprehended in Two Inns</p>
<p>Handguns and Stolen Silver Dollars Recovered</p>
<p>The Jin Tongchun Hotel, owned by Wu Yonggen, a local Shanghai resident, at 30 Ximen Road in the French Concession, was suddenly raided by five thieves at approximately 3:00 AM the day before yesterday. The thieves brandished handguns to intimidate the staff, stealing fifteen silver dollars and 51 jiao (cents). They fled with the loot. The owner chased after them, shouting for help. Patrol Officer No. 154 apprehended one thief, Lu Jinsheng from Zhejiang, and sent him to the court for interrogation and detention. This was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Subsequently, Detective Lu Zhuqing, the chief detective of the Second Investigation Group, learned that the gang was hiding in Room 9 of the Xin Wanli Inn at 29 Lanwei'ai Road and the Xin Zhenhe Inn at 174 Xinxin Bridge Street. He immediately led Deputy Detectives Wang Rusong and Zhang Daorong, Detectives Liu Jinrong, Shen Jinshu, and Wu Jiahui, to rush to the scene to make arrests. They found the thieves dividing the stolen money. Yong people Zhang A Hong (35 years old), Shen Ji Gui (31 years old), Wang Zi Lin (32 years old), Wang Rong Tian (42 years old, from Hangzhou), and Gu Feng Qi (36 years old, from Chongming) were arrested. Nearly twenty silver dollars, a six-round genuine handgun, and two wooden imitation handguns were recovered and taken back to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Police Lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, stating that the police had not yet investigated the defendants and requested a postponement for further investigation, to be combined with the case of the already apprehended thief Lu Jinsheng. The stolen silver dollars and real and imitation handguns were submitted as evidence. Judge Li Changnian approved the request, briefly questioned the defendants, and ordered a postponement for joint trial on the 16th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>Zhang Zigang's Home Searched, 84 Pawn Tickets Found</p>
<p>| Police Believe He is Definitely Not a Good Person |</p>
<p>Luring Young Men to Sell in Other Provinces</p>
<p>Previously Detained for Abducting Zhang Hongsheng</p>
<p>Zhang Zigang, a 19-year-old Zhapu native residing at 146 Dongxi Huade Road, is fond of women and does not engage in honest work. He specializes in wandering around and luring young men to a certain opera house under the pretense of learning opera, colluding with abductors to deceive them into being sold in other provinces for profit. At 9:00 PM the day before yesterday, Zhang Hongsheng, a 14-year-old Zhenjiang native apprentice at the Baili Rattan Shop at 258 Broadway Road, was instructed by his employer, Mrs. Wu Gu, to collect payment from a certain number on Nanjing Road. He met Zhang Zigang on the Bund, who asked him where he was working. Zhang Hongsheng told him directly. Zhang Zigang seized the opportunity to say, "Do you want to learn Peking Opera? I can introduce you to the Xingyue Association at 4 Huichang Lane, Dongxi Huade Road, where you can learn opera and earn a lot of money in the future, which is much better than learning at the rattan shop." The young apprentice believed him and agreed. Zhang Zigang accompanied him to the front of the shop and waited nearby. The apprentice returned the receipt and money to his employer, changed into new clothes, and ran away with Zhang. Mrs. Wu Gu, the shop owner, noticed and followed them to Zhuangyuan Bridge, where she found the two talking and walking. She grabbed them both, leading to a dispute. Chinese Officer No. 506 investigated and learned the details, arresting Zhang Zigang and taking him to the Hongkou Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that the police had found 84 pawn tickets in the defendant's home, indicating that the defendant was definitely not a good person and had no family living with him. The case still needs to be investigated, and the defendant should be detained. Mrs. Wu Gu and Zhang Hongsheng testified to the facts. The defendant prevaricated in his testimony, claiming that the pawn tickets found by the police were all for his own clothes. Judge Xiao approved the testimony and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<p>Three More Suspects Arrested in the Sun Yushun Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Sun's Relatives Highly Suspected</p>
<p>Transferred to the French Concession Police Station for Handling</p>
<p>Sun Yushun, a 50-year-old Shaoxing native, residing at 115 Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, formerly owned three businesses, including the Yicheng Silk Thread Shop at Xinbei Gate in Nanshi and the Xiechangxiang Department Store in front of Yimiao Temple, with assets of over 200,000 yuan. Due to business difficulties, he had previously declared bankruptcy, retaining only the Xiechangxiang store, which was still doing fairly well. Sun's wife, Wu, 46 years old, had a son and a daughter. The eldest daughter, Huixia, 19, was studying at Ai Qun School. The younger son, Qiabao, was only 6 years old, and his parents loved him very much. The Sun family was still relatively well-off, and the interior of their house was richly furnished, attracting the attention of criminals. At 11:30 AM on May 20th of this year, Qiabao was playing in front of the door when he was suddenly kidnapped by criminals and disappeared. Sun then received a letter from the kidnappers, stating that his child was safe and sound and that he could contact them by posting a note on the back door to show his sincerity. At the time, Sun was worried after his son was kidnapped. Zheng Wenxiang, a fellow villager who had moved in as a tenant on March 6th, and his two wives repeatedly consoled Sun and offered suggestions, but Sun expressed his willingness to offer a reward of 80 yuan, which had no result. He then reported the incident to the French Concession Police Station, requesting an investigation. A few days later, Sun received another letter from the kidnappers, demanding a ransom of 8,000 yuan for the release of his son. Detectives rushed to Sun's house to investigate and obtained clues. A few days ago, they, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the Old Zhabei Police Station in the Public Concession, arrested suspects Qiu Yaoshan, Li Ziqing, and Zhou Wuying from Hangzhou, as well as Chen Lou and Chen Zhou, the wives of Zheng Wenxiang, at Nos. 509 and 516 of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road. The next day, they continued to arrest Min Xinhao (Min had previously committed a crime and been released). When Zheng Wenxiang heard the police coming to arrest him, he escaped by jumping out of a window. Only five criminals, including Qiu, were interrogated and sent to the Second Special District Court. On May 25th, Judge Li Changnian interrogated them and ordered them to be returned to custody. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the arrested criminals confessed to the involvement of the plaintiff's relatives, Shi Wende, and others. Detectives, together with Lu Ying, the leader of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, instructed Li Xiaobao, the squad leader of the Second District Criminal Investigation, Detectives Liang Zhiqing, and Patrol Officers Zhou Zhicheng and Yang Xihui, to lead police to secretly go to 290 Lujiabang Road, Sanguantang, Nanshi, at midnight the day before yesterday. Shi was out. Detectives Li Xiaobao and others waited and arrested Shi Wende (59 years old), Xu Jianqing (28 years old), and Wang Jiangqing (39 years old), all natives of Shaoxing, and found a photo of the hostage, Qiabao, and notes. They were taken to the district police station. According to Shi Wende's confession to District Chief Li, he lives upstairs at 890 Beile Road, French Concession, and works as a runner at the Yongxing Coal Company. He is Sun's nephew. After Qiabao was kidnapped, Sun gave him a photo of Qiabao with a signature on the back, asking him to find him. Wu Nianjiu, Sun's brother-in-law, a Shaoxing native who runs a stove shop on Shanghai-Minhang South Zhejiang Road in Nanshi, learned of this. On July 9th, Xu Jianqing contacted Sun's family. Wang Jiangqing confessed that he is the manager of Yongxing Coal Company and that Shi had asked him to investigate. Xu Jianqing confessed that he is a salesman for Yongxing Coal Company. The other confessions were evasive. District Chief Li determined that the case involved kidnapping and was complicated. He approved the transfer of the three criminals, including Shi, to the French Concession Police Station at 3:00 PM yesterday for handling.</p>
<p>Three British Crew Members of the Nanchang Steamer Released After Being Kidnapped</p>
<p>Had Been in the Bandit's Lair for Over Five Months</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Aboard the Daming Steamer</p>
<p>Three crew members of the Nanchang steamer of the British firm Taikoo Dockyard, after being kidnapped by bandits in the Niuzhuang area, were finally rescued by the Japanese authorities through negotiations with the bandits after more than five months. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Daming steamer. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Kidnapped for Five Months</p>
<p>The Taikoo's Nanchang steamer is an irregular temporary cargo ship operating between the north and south seas. On March 29th of this year, the ship transported goods to Niuzhuang. Three crew members, British nationals Bai Lu, Johnson, and Halev, were kidnapped by bandits. The bandits regarded the three British nationals as valuable commodities, so they treated them quite well. However, the location where they were held was constantly changed to prevent Japanese troops from suppressing them. After the three British nationals entered the bandits' lair, they mostly lived in sorghum fields and remote mountains. The Japanese authorities, at the urging of British Consul Clarke stationed in Yingkou, advanced with both suppression and redemption. Because the bandits demanded a ransom of one million, they could not immediately comply, so it took five months for them to be rescued and escape danger.</p>
<p>Rescue and Escape</p>
<p>The captain of the Japanese garrison's military police in Yingkou, Captain Koyanagi, personally entered Panshan to negotiate the ransom with the bandit leader in order to rescue the three British nationals. After many negotiations between the two sides, they could not agree because the bandits' ransom demand was too high. In mid-July, the Japanese authorities sent troops to suppress the bandits, resulting in a decisive battle. However, they still did not rescue the three. Finally, on the 5th of this month, Captain Koyanagi again entered Panshan and conducted the final negotiation with the bandit leader, agreeing to increase the ransom and also agreeing to return the captured bandits to the bandits. The bandit leader also felt the danger of being surrounded by the Japanese army, so he accepted the terms of the 5th negotiation, agreeing to send the ransom and return the 26 relatives of the captured bandits. The bandits sent the three British nationals out.</p>

<p>Released in Yingkou</p>
<p>After Captain Koyanagi agreed on the terms with the bandits, he returned to Niuzhuang, notified the British Consul, and brought the money and 26 bandits, accompanied by a translator, to Panshan on the 7th of this month. He first sent a person to ask the bandit leader about the condition of the three British nationals. Upon receiving the reply that they were all safe, Koyanagi handed the money over to the bandit leader for collection. Then, at 3:00 PM on the 8th, the three British nationals were sent out from a sorghum field about ten miles from Panshan and taken to Niuzhuang by the Japanese, where they were handed over to the British Consul Clarke of Yingkou. The British naval authorities specially dispatched the destroyer HMS Whitestone to Yingkou for this matter. When the three British nationals traveled by train from Panshan to Niuzhuang, the captain of the ship also went to the station to escort them.</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai by Steamer</p>
<p>After the British Consul in Yingkou rescued the three and brought them to the consulate, they took baths, changed clothes, and requested doctors to treat them. Because the three British nationals had been trapped in the bandits' lair for a long time and it was summer, they appeared haggard. The British Consul sent a telegram to Shanghai to report the matter. The Taikoo Company reported that they would stay at the consulate for a few days and wait for the ship to return to Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Daming steamer happened to be going to Niuzhuang to transport goods to Shanghai. The three British nationals Bai Lu, Johnson, and Halev, eager to go to Shanghai, took the Daming steamer to Shanghai from Yingkou. At 5:00 PM yesterday, the Daming steamer arrived in Shanghai. The German shipowner of Taikoo and others went to the dock to escort everyone ashore and report the situation in the bandits' lair after being kidnapped to the company. It is now learned that the contracts of two of the three will expire soon, and they plan to leave Shanghai and return to England immediately. It is said that the situation experienced by the three in the bandits' lair has been specially purchased by a certain London newspaper for exclusive publication and will be revealed one after another.</p>
<p>Ministry of Transportation Establishes Telecommunications Equipment Testing Institute</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation, recognizing the large number of self-made and purchased telecommunications equipment, decided that it would be difficult to determine the quality of the materials without prior testing. Ordinarily, the Ministry would send the equipment to experts in various telecommunications bureaus for testing, and then make separate decisions. However, this was scattered across various locations, making the procedures extremely inconvenient. Now, in order to centralize expertise and use the latest scientific methods for testing to ensure accuracy, the Ministry has specially established a Telecommunications Equipment Testing Institute at 17 Maigen Road and appointed Shen Fuhai, the chief engineer of submarine cables, as the director of the institute. Technical experts Yu Bingjian, Xu Liang, Shen Zuheng, and Chen Zenglin are appointed as technicians. In the future, all telephone, wireless, and wired telecommunications equipment will have a dedicated institute for testing. If private individuals or individuals use electrical equipment and entrust the institute for testing, they will surely be satisfied with the excellent results.</p>
<p>The Only Urban-Rural Friendship Association in the Declining Countryside of Weiting Mountain</p>
<p>Weiting Mountain is located thirty li east of Suzhou. Since the Suzhou Youth Association established a rural service center in the town five years ago, various undertakings have improved. The town will hold a urban-rural friendship on September 17th (Sunday) to raise social awareness of the countryside and invigorate the spirit of farmers to improve. Invitations have been sent to celebrities from Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou to participate. At that time, there will surely be a lively scene. At a time when the countryside is declining, it is possible to go and see the actual situation of farmers' activities.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Executive Committee of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association held a standing committee meeting of the executive committee at 5:00 PM yesterday. Zhu Shengmao, Tong Lizhang, Jin Liren, Cheng Zhusun, Du Yuesheng (replacing Cheng), Xu Xiuting, Dong Kechang, Qu Zhenhua, Shang Mujian, Dai Chunfeng, Pan Zhaobang, and Li Weiliang attended. Zhang Gengshan, Wu Guowei, Yu Jingqing, and others were present. Cheng Zhusun chaired the meeting, and Shao Bingyuan recorded the minutes. The chairman first reported on the implementation of the resolutions passed in the previous meeting, then read letters from various parties and proposed matters, and then began discussions. (1) Regarding the letter from the Fourth District Branch stating that the French Municipal Council is still strictly collecting tent donations, it was resolved that although the Municipal Council has already reduced this year's tent donations, it is still difficult for the various businesses to bear the burden. Another letter will be sent to the Council, requesting them to give special consideration and not be overly demanding, and urging them to cancel this meaningless tax in the next term. Chairman Cheng was also recommended to contact the Director of the Municipal Council; (2) Regarding the letter from the Fourth District Branch requesting that the French Police be stopped from arbitrarily fining merchants, it was resolved that a letter should be sent to the French Police based on the incoming letter, requesting them not to arbitrarily fine merchants in order to alleviate their difficulties; (3) Regarding the letter from the tenant representatives of Yufu Lane, Nanyang Bridge, stating that the landlord ordered the tenants to vacate the premises before the time for demolition and reconstruction, requesting assistance, and recommending representatives such as Yang Yingsheng to come to the meeting to petition, it was resolved that Xu Xiuting and Tong Lizhang were recommended to investigate the facts and mediate within the possible scope; (4) Regarding the letter from Ms. Jiang Zhu stating that her son died in the Gongda Printing Factory and requesting redress, and requesting assistance from Ms. Jiang Zhu to come and ask for help, it was resolved that this is a legal issue and Ms. Jiang Zhu should file a lawsuit in court herself. The association cannot do anything. Considering that Ms. Jiang Zhu is an orphan and widow, on the grounds of justice, it can only send a letter to the factory inquiring about the cause of the accident. It will handle the matter after receiving a reply; (5) Regarding the re-election of the third session of the association, it was resolved that it would be discussed and prepared for after the new association headquarters is moved into. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>Gambling and Fighting Lead to Murder</p>
<p>Li Shier from Qingkou was watching his fellow villager Zhao Xinian, 45 years old, playing mahjong with others at the entrance of 12 Huaji Road at 9:00 PM on the 5th of this month. Zhao lost all of his money. He was resentful and spoke rudely. Li, who was behind Zhao, interrupted and said not to yell. Zhao became enraged and cursed, leading to a fight. As a result, Li, who was stronger, knocked Zhao to the ground. Zhao suffered serious injuries</p>

<p>Among them, however, is only a very small problem. However, because the United States has a proposal to use silver as a reserve, the silver group in the subcommittee, which includes silver commissioners, has as many as thirteen countries. This group elected the US representative, Mr. Pittman, as chairman. Mr. Pittman is a man of strong self-confidence and believes that he has a very thorough understanding of silver issues. He said that the fall in silver prices is actually due to the chaotic pricing in India. The only way to save it is to prevent governments from selling their silver reserves on the market and stop collecting silver taxes. There was quite a bit of debate at the time, as each party had its own difficulties. So, it was agreed outside the meeting that silver-producing governments would jointly request a portion of the Indian government's silver reserves. Our country's</p>

<p>Made great efforts in running around. When the discussion reached the point of India selling 35 million taels per year, a sudden twist occurred because Spain also wanted to sell. Its central bank has a reserve of 100 million ounces. As a result, it was agreed to sell 5 million ounces per year. The Indian government's sales portion would be purchased by the United States at 24 million per year, and the remaining 11 million would be shared by various countries, with Mexico taking the most and Canada second. Later, fearing that countries would be unable to afford it and</p>
<p>Fail to fulfill the contract, after further consultation, India requested a guarantee from the United States. The United States was outwardly reluctant to agree, but the result implied that the US could provide guarantees. This is</p>
<h3 id="e149">The General Outline of the Silver Agreement <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>When the discussion reached the original proposal that the silver content of subsidiary coins should be increased to 80% and that the government should not sell melted coins on the market, the Dutch representative objected again, because they did not want to be bound in any way under the current conference situation. Later, Italy also echoed this. After further consultation, it was agreed that the silver contract would be effective for a limited period. Mr. Pittman's tough attitude actually made the atmosphere in the meeting tense. However, the United States is also a country with a large silver reserve, and other countries had to show some restraint, so they compromised with each other and reached an agreement. The agreement will be implemented on January 1 next year. The responsibility our country bears in it is the provision of Article 4, that our country shall not melt currency or reduce its fineness within four years, and</p>
<p>Sell off the remaining silver. This is because the gold standard method proposed by Cornwall includes the necessity of going through this procedure, and this clause is specifically to prevent it. In addition, there are many complexities regarding the various processes of the agreement. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I cannot report in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e150">War Zone Policyholders Begin Large Claims Yesterday <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>First Negotiated with Sincere Company Yesterday</p>
<p>The war zone policyholders have been claiming compensation from the Cooperative Advancement Association for more than a year without any results. They gathered and discussed, deciding that they must take active measures. It was decided to set off in three teams. The first team is the negotiation team, led by Song Liangcai, who will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. The second team, led by Zheng Shaojin, will serve as the reserve team. The remaining teams will be led by Zheng Shicheng, Ma Rugen, Wang Yongxiang, Liang Baolin, etc. Yesterday, they negotiated with Sincere Company in a civilized manner, so the police also maintained fairness and did not interfere. When claiming compensation at Sincere, there were about seventy people, each carrying bread for endurance. Fortunately, Wang Zhixiang, the chairman of the claims association, arrived and, after negotiating with the company's Guo, obtained a written reply from the company, agreeing to contact the insurance association and then determine a solution. It is now heard that the policyholders plan to negotiate for a long time, taking turns to claim compensation from Chinese and foreign insurance companies.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Tax Exemption for Pawnshops in Disaster Areas <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Allowed Exemption from Business Tax for the First Half of the 21st Year</p>
<p>Tax Payments Already Made Will Be Offset Against the 23rd Year</p>
<p>The Finance Bureau replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that, in response to your Chamber's letter No. 436, which included a letter from the Pawnshop Industry Association stating that all members of the Zhabei District, including Mingxing Xiangfeng and other pawnshops, requested to be exempted from the business tax for the first half of the 21st year, similar to the city's exemption of house tax in the war zone, and to offset the tax payments already made for the 21st year against the business tax for the 23rd year, please review and reply. Upon this, the Bureau ordered the Municipal North Collection Office to investigate and reply. Subsequently, the office submitted a report stating that the case also included a letter from the pawnshop association and a joint petition from Dexiang and other pawnshops, stating that they were currently under review. It coincided with the Bureau's previous order, and the investigation revealed that during last year's Shanghai Incident, the pawnshops were all located within the war zone, and their business losses were indeed a fact. Therefore, it was proposed to exempt them from the business tax for the first half of the 21st year, similar to the city's exemption of house tax in the war zone, and to offset the tax payments already made against the business tax for the first half of the 23rd year, which was deemed reasonable. It was proposed to approve that new establishments opened after the war in the 21st year should still be taxed for the entire year, not included in the tax reduction, to ensure fairness. Furthermore, the letters from the shops also included joint names of the pawnshop industry, which should be handled uniformly according to the case, etc., and a list of business tax grades for pawnshops in Zhabei was attached. The Bureau forwarded the matter to the Municipal Government for review and approval. Now, the 7343rd instruction states, "All submitted documents are noted. Approval is granted for exemption and verification of offsetting. This order is hereby notified." Upon this, in addition to ordering the Municipal North Collection Office to verify the offsetting of half of the 80% tax already paid for the 21st year by each household listed in the table, a corresponding letter is hereby sent to your Chamber for your information, and you are requested to inform them accordingly.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern: We have received a statement from the family of Xu Shilong, stating that they recently read in the Shen Bao of September 13, 22nd year, a section on a special second court judgment punishing drug traffickers, which stated that Xu Shilong of No. 3, Lane 5, Ximen Road, French Concession, sold morphine and was recently arrested by the police in Xuzhou and sent to court, sentenced to three years in prison, etc. Upon investigation, Xu Shilong is now doing business in the Pingjin area and has no connection to the drug case in Lane 5. Therefore, we have been entrusted by a representative to request a correction. Upon investigation, our client, Xu Shilong, is not related to the previous case, and the court has not made any judgment of guilt. This matter concerns reputation, and we hereby request your newspaper to make a correction. To the Shen Bao, Lawyer Fei Guoxi, September 13,</p>
<p>Esteemed Sirs: I recently saw in your newspaper's news summary that when Qianxinfang caught fire, No. 38 was occupied by me, and I had moved in for less than half a month when a fire broke out at my right neighbor (No. 39) and spread to my place. It was not my place that caught fire. Yesterday, it happened to be after a festival at home, and I was accompanying my female relatives on a visit to Wing On Company when this unexpected disaster struck. My savings of many years were lost in an instant. The most regrettable thing is that the ancestral Yitian document and several IOUs were burned, and it is unknown whether there will be a basis for repayment in the future. I have always thought that your newspaper upholds justice, so please make a correction to respect the facts. With anticipation, Wei Rongzong bows, September 13.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Industry Control <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>The development of Japan's foreign trade and the best-selling of factory products are all attributed to the industry control under the sponsorship of the Japanese government. What is most regrettable is that China's industry associations have very little power and inconsistent methods. Therefore, they still seek their own interests, only caring about individual development and lacking the spirit of cooperation to face the outside world together. Compared with the Japanese, who are willing to sacrifice and advance aggressively, and give industry associations great power, it is really incomparable. However, in practice industry control, not only does China's industrial and commercial sector currently lack this power, but in fact there are also great difficulties. In practice, the most important factors are three: First, statistics; second, talents; third, morality. Without accurate statistics, the waxing and waning of prosperity and decline are baseless. If you don't know others and you don't know yourself, it's like a rabble suddenly facing a complete army. How can you not fail? How can you not retreat? Without specialized talents, management is poor, technology is not sophisticated, costs are not cheap, and products are not good. If there is a lack of people to study and a lack of skills to assess, how can you practice it? How can you get results? Without perfect morality, there is competition and jealousy, only profit is sought, and there is infighting and</p>
<p>Conflicts, implementing their "you die, I live" tactics, and even arbitrarily breaking agreements. Industry rules and regulations are regarded as mere formalities. The result is still each dreaming its own dream, and undercurrents rise one after another. This kind of association is equivalent to nothing, how can it last? Therefore, the reason why the national products industry is not easy to progress today and cannot face the outside world together is because of the lack of control power of industry associations. This is the most heartbreaking and helpless thing. However, people advance and I retreat, people press and I yield. If I don't realize it, how can I survive? It is especially hoped that the industry will rise up urgently to thoroughly realize this in order to cope with these thousands of difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Talking About the Raw Material Problems of National Products <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Bingren</p>
<p>Promoting national products is an effective way to resist economic aggression from the outside and support industrial development from the inside. Its significance is very profound. In recent years, the awakening of the people has indeed seen considerable results. On the one hand, national products factories have laid a relatively solid foundation, and on the other hand, they have worked harder to research and improve their products. The reputation of national products is growing and they are being warmly welcomed everywhere. Looking at the current situation, if the factories can continue to work hard, the future development is truly immeasurable. However, in today's booming national products, some people are reviewing the raw material problem of national products. Raw materials, it is the mother of the product, caring about the raw materials while caring about the national product, is indeed a deeper level of comparison; and for the sake of loving the national product, we also confirm that this problem needs to be reviewed. Originally, the manufacture of national products should completely use domestic raw materials, which is really a matter of no doubt, because the promotion of national products was originally to plug the leak, restore rights and interests, if imported raw materials are used, then how to implement the true meaning of promoting national products. But the facts may not be so, let's see below: This time, the China National Products Guidance Institute conducted a general survey of the national products industry in Shanghai, paying special attention to the raw materials used by various factories. According to the survey results, factories in various categories inevitably use some imported raw materials, but this is not because the factories are willing to use foreign goods, it is really because the domestic raw materials are too scarce! When the institute conducted the survey, it also studied this problem with the persons in charge of various factories. The factories also regretted that there were no national products available! Here are a few of the most prominent examples:</p>
<p>(1) Spinning industry According to the national calculation, more than 8 million dan of cotton are used every year, while the domestic cotton, even in the year of good harvest, is not as much as this number, and because of its rough quality and short fiber, factories that spin yarn above 16 counts must use foreign cotton, that is, the quality and quantity of domestic cotton are insufficient to supply the needs of various factories, and the factories, in the case of necessity, can only purchase foreign cotton in moderation.</p>
<p>(2) Weaving industry Both cotton weaving and knitwear mainly use yarn and dyeing pigments as raw materials. Our country's yarn factories are still in the stage of spinning coarse yarn, and finer yarns above 42 counts cannot be produced, so factories that want to use fine yarn have to rely on foreign goods. As for dyeing pigments, our country only has a natural plant, and the most advanced man-made pigments of modern times are not produced at all. In order to facilitate use and reduce costs, various factories have to purchase dyes from foreign merchants. (3) Silk weaving industry In today's silk weaving market, interwoven fabrics and man-made silk fabrics occupy a very important position, and the raw material of these two kinds of fabrics, man-made silk, is not produced in the country at all. Since the factories cannot not weave this, it is inevitable that they purchase raw materials from foreign countries.</p>
<p>(4) Machinery industry The manufacture of machinery and its accessories uses steel and iron as raw materials, but the country only produces pig iron from Liuhegou. Wrought iron and steel are both lacking. The Han Yeping Company's iron plant produces iron and the Han plant produces steel, and its products could have met the needs of a part of the factories, but the entire company was shut down due to years of war. Therefore, today, the raw materials of steel and iron used by various factories, except for pig iron, have to be completely supplied by imported goods. Other raw materials, such as the three acid basic raw materials of the chemical industry, the iron sheets of the hardware industry, the wood pulp of the paper industry, and the tree rubber of the rubber industry, cannot be used because domestic products cannot supply or are insufficient to supply them. It is really too many to list. In general, national products are indeed suffering from a very serious raw material shortage; because they have to engage in manufacturing, they can only borrow imported raw materials to relieve the shortage. However, because the number of domestic raw materials is surprisingly small, the import of imported raw materials is also surprisingly large! Finally, it must be solemnly stated that although the current national products contain a certain amount of imported raw material components, this is neither because the manufacturers are willing to use foreign goods, nor is it absolutely hopeless to gradually improve. Everything is a temporary transitional phenomenon, and those who love to use national products must love these national products that are moving forward more enthusiastically!</p>

<p>Chairman Lin Zichao of the National Government came to Shanghai to recuperate, and he often traveled in disguise, which he enjoyed very much. At about 9:00 yesterday morning, he personally visited the China National Products Company (Nanjing Road Continental Mall). The company did not know in advance, and was received by a certain gentleman who accompanied him to visit various departments. The chairman purchased a fly catcher in the glass department, and selected several silk lampshades in the electrical department. At the 99 shopping mall, the chairman praised the low prices of various goods and chose his favorite ones to buy. In the music department, the chairman bought a finely crafted moon lute and played it for a while, feeling quite interesting. The candy department also bought several kinds of food. The chairman's personal visit to purchase national products shows his concern for the national products industry. If our country's government and people wear and use national products, prosperity and strength can be expected soon. The chairman praised the company quite a bit. Later, because the chairman was eager to go elsewhere, he did not have time to entertain him. The company expressed its deep apologies.</p>
<p>National Products Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e166">Promoting the "Unity of Knowledge and Action" of National Products <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Rongyu</p>
<p>"This year is the year of national products, we must promote national products." This has been shouted for a long time, what is its effect? On the customs' statistical table, the import of foreign goods has not decreased; in the windows of major companies, samples from Osaka, Paris, London, and New York are displayed, and they are being bought and sold competitively; modern ladies, they are living advertisements for the use of foreign goods, and they will not wear or use anything other than foreign goods. Our year of national products, the results are so exceptional, it really makes foreigners laugh and angers those who care. We have also held several national products exhibitions and several national products campaigns, which are equivalent to a shot of adrenaline. It is exciting for the moment, but afterwards it is still dazed. Is it that we Chinese are so stubborn and willing to be economically dominated by others? This makes me think of the "unity of knowledge and action" advocated by the late Premier. "Knowing but not acting is equal to not knowing." "Wanting to act but not knowing turns into blind work." What's the use of this? Our promotion of national products, unexpectedly, has also committed these two problems.</p>
<p>(1) Knowing but not acting These people are mostly intellectuals and modern ladies. They clearly know that this is a foreign product: they also clearly know that using foreign products is harmful to the country's lifeblood. But I love fashion, I covet beauty, what does the country have to do with me? Moreover, they also have this mentality: thinking that it is good for you to use national products, and it is unlikely that my using foreign products alone will affect the country. This kind of biased and ignorant prejudice is really the country's fatal wound. Because you can use foreign goods, how can I not use foreign goods? Who has the patent to use foreign goods? If this goes on, will the country still be able to cope? Moreover, this kind of person is the representative of the times Hurry up and build the dike, Shi Ying</p>
<p>Those who wear what they love and use what they love, even in remote villages, will follow suit. "If the city likes high buns, then the four directions will be one foot high." The reason why national products cannot be promoted is because these people are making trouble. If we want to promote national products, we must first sanction these people.</p>
<p>How to sanction these people? You want to persuade him, he doesn't not understand. Or he is eloquent and speaks of how shoddy national products are; how insufficient the production rate is, but instead makes the person who persuaded him speechless. I think "a sense of shame is something everyone has." For all those who love to use foreign goods, the people of the opinion world, verbally criticize them and write about them, inspiring their conscience; and the people in society do not associate with them, to increase their shame. When dealing with this kind of "knowing and deliberately committing" people, there is really no other way to think of.</p>
<p>(2) Wanting to act but not knowing, all those who have a little blood and a little conscience cannot but love to buy national products. However, the market is full of foreign goods, and unless you are an expert, you really cannot distinguish between foreign and domestic goods. There are also unscrupulous merchants who only seek profits and have no national concept, changing the appearance and passing off fish eyes as pearls, deliberately passing off inferior goods as national products. This makes those who love to buy national products unable to use their strength; therefore, the money wrongly sent in secret every year is unknown. However, this kind of problem is ultimately easier than the first: it is also easier to cure.</p>
<p>How to cure it? (1) Set up more national products companies. Taking Shanghai alone, although there is the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's national products shopping mall; the two national products companies on Nanjing Road; the Penglai Market in Ximen, it is actually not enough. I think there must be at least one national products store on every street. It doesn't matter if the scale is smaller, as long as it is not mixed with counterfeit goods. (2) Issue national products pamphlets. For various daily national products, the various road business associations or local chambers of commerce will print a small pamphlet, with all the trademarks, origins, and functions explained in detail. This not only gives those who love to use national products a compass; and also promotes the method of publicity for the promotion of national products, which will definitely have a considerable effect. (3) Strictly ban the change of appearance by unscrupulous merchants. We have no right to prohibit unscrupulous merchants from selling inferior goods. However, we know that inferior goods are not bought, which is already enough to make him suffer. Only when he changes his brand name, that is no different from setting a trap to trap people. It is necessary to strictly ban this in law and morality. This layer still needs the assistance of the official government, and the public cannot directly sanction it.</p>
<p>I have said this piece of words. It is nothing more than hoping that "those who know can act," "those who act also know," so that there is a line of hope for the future of national products. However, the ancients said; "There is no sorrow greater than the death of the heart, and death of the body is secondary." Almost half of the hearts of those who know but do not act are dead, and they must have their consciences resurrected before they are willing to love and use national products. As for those who act but do not know, that is like having a cold and cough, which is not harmful to the future of national products.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Gift-Giving Dialogue <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Wife: My mother's birthday is in a few days. What do you plan to give her?</p>
<p>Husband: I was thinking, this year is the year of national products. Our clothes are all national products now. For mother-in-law's birthday, we should send some national product food, right?</p>
<p>Wife: Are there even national product foods? Which company makes them? How much do they cost? What's the quality like?</p>
<p>Husband: Mooncakes, meat dumplings, etc., from Guanshengyuan are all very good national product foods, and they aren't expensive either. How about we buy a few boxes and send them over?</p>
<p>Wife: Okay, okay... We're wearing national product clothes to the birthday celebration, so we should bring national product food as a gift. That's more fitting.</p>
<p>Husband: Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Notes on a Visit</p>
<h3 id="e168">A Visit to the Tongcheng Textile Factory <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Weiqiao</p>
<p>Nothing is truly useless; it's all about being able to utilize it. After visiting the Tongcheng Textile Factory, I began to believe this statement was undeniably true. This factory is located at Qikenyan on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. It has been established for ten years and uses leftover cotton waste from ordinary yarn factories, or discarded silk or wool, to weave finished products that are remarkably beautiful. It is internally divided into bleaching and dyeing, picking cotton, recycled silk, cotton batting, cleaning cotton, mixing cotton, spinning yarn, reeling yarn, weaving, preparation, finishing, packaging, repair, and material departments. The work proceeds sequentially, and the arrangement is very organized. The picking cotton, recycled silk, cotton batting, and bleaching and dyeing departments are the initial stages of work. Cotton waste, old silk floss, and discarded wool, etc., are bleached and dyed with coloring or manually picked, or crushed by recycled silk machines, or cleaned by cotton batting machines, thus becoming high-quality raw materials, which can then be spun into yarn and woven into cloth after passing through cotton cleaning and mixing machines. The spinning and weaving departments are the main workshops of the factory, with fourteen coarse and fine spinning machines and two military blanket machines. There is a grading room to test the weight, thickness, and tensile strength of the yarn. There are fifty-two looms, with jacquard heads and automatic shuttle boxes, which are extremely modern. In addition, machines in departments such as preparation, bleaching and dyeing, and finishing are also excellent. The factory's equipment, from the building to the machines, is scientific in every way. The factory building is constructed with reinforced concrete, and the roof is sawtooth-shaped, providing ample light and suitable temperature. The technical management is especially precise. The factory has a well-equipped research laboratory where various raw materials and samples are stored and displayed as research materials. Management is able to use scientific methods to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Inside and outside the factory, tung trees and cypress trees are planted everywhere, creating a dense, green shade. Stepping into it, one almost forgets it is a factory. Factories that use waste materials usually have a lot of dust. This factory has white iron pipes installed on the machines, with electric fans blowing the dust into a dust tower, so its cleanliness is unmatched by other factories. I especially appreciate the exceptionally harmonious relationship between labor and management. The workers, numbering nearly a thousand, all work together with one heart, cherishing the factory. Every time I visited the various departments, I saw the supervisors wearing yellow uniforms, directing traffic, full of energy. The workers were amiable and worked diligently. They treated the factory director, Mr. Chi Zongmo, the deputy factory director, Mr. Fang Shaohe, and the head of the engineering department, Mr. Zhang Yuwen, as family members. Therefore, the operation of the factory proceeds as smoothly as an arm obeys the body and a finger obeys the arm, with its effectiveness occurring almost imperceptibly. The factory's main products include plain and patterned thick velvet cloth, plain and patterned velvet blankets, military blankets, 4-count and 6-count coarse yarn, silk floss yarn, Ziqiang woolen cloth, Autumn and Spring woolen cloth, Lianjie cloth, and medicated cotton cloth, etc., with a wide variety of products, all of excellent quality and bright colors. Its ability to turn waste materials into valuable items is truly remarkable and can compete with imported goods. Over the years, it has participated in exhibitions in various provinces and has always received the highest awards. The walls of the reception room are filled with them, which can prove its achievements. Han Yu said: "Large wood is used for rafters, small wood for purlins, thin planks for doors and windows, and small wood for pivots, hinges, and wedges, each getting its due place; to apply these to build a house is the work of a craftsman; jade slips, cinnabar, red arrows, blue sesame, cow urine, horse dung, and broken drum skin, all are collected and stored, awaiting use without waste, this is the skill of a good doctor." This factory uses cotton, wool, and silk waste to produce excellent goods, preventing the outflow of economic interests and revitalizing national products. It is like the work of a craftsman and the skill of a good doctor, enabling each item to be used appropriately. This is truly gratifying! When I came, it happened that the factory's artesian well was clogged with mud and could not produce water. The personnel in its engineering department installed a motor on the canal, pumped water into the west pond of the factory, and devised a way to filter it clean, connecting it with iron pipes. In a few days, they created running water, supplying the entire factory. From this, one can see the spirit with which they handle matters on a daily basis. I secretly think that such reasonable factories are truly rare in the country. If there were large capitalists to help it expand its scope, its future development would be immeasurable! As for the welfare of the workers, such as gardens, bathrooms, schools, hospitals, libraries, and club facilities, I have written another article to record them, so I will not elaborate here.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Province's Recent Primary School Funding Statistics</p>
<p>4,644,970 Yuan</p>
<p>The Joint Office for Preparing Compulsory Education in Jiangsu Province has compiled statistics on the total amount of education funding in all counties of Jiangsu Province (the total education expenses of all counties, 11,335,626 yuan). The situation has been reported in previous newspapers. The funding for public and private elementary schools and elementary school divisions in all counties for the 21st year is listed below:</p>
<p>Jiangning 58,036 yuan, Jurong 66,370, Lishui 20,632, Gaochun 19,510, Jiangpu 19,663, Liuhe 46,798, Zhenjiang 109,724, Danyang 85,350, Jintan 47,511, Liyang 78,945, Yangzhong 6,762, Shanghai 57,383, Songjiang 125,023, Nanhui 131,064, Qingpu 7,900, Fengxian 31,080, Jinshan 53,743, Chuansha 40,838, Taicang 60,144, Jiading 83,058, Baoshan 53,491, Chongming 48,729, Haimen 66,081, Wuxian 346,717, Changshu 194,427, Kunshan 93,337, Wujiang 149,588, Wujin 218,815, Wuxi 362,294, Yixing 144,440, Jiangyin 150,152, Jingjiang 39,702, Nantong 212,787, Rugao 195,874, Taixing 58,462, Huaiyin 20,171, Huaian 59,745, Siyang 15,060, Lianshui 51,914, Funing 48,646, Yancheng 123,670, Jiangdu 56,964, Yizheng 25,237, Dongtai 45,091, Xinghua 60,540, Taixian 59,280, Gaoyou 22,320, Baoying 28,668, Gangshan 79,545, Fengxian 38,609, Peixian 38,951, Xiaoxian 42,165, Dangshan 20,607, Pixian 27,574, Suqian 39,408, Suining 25,024, Donghai 13,110, Guanyun 34,214, Shuyang 2,349, Ganyu 36,333, Qidong 52,640. The total for all the above is 4,644,970 yuan.</p>
<p>(Explanation) (1) The total amount of elementary school funding is 4,644,970 yuan. Those with more than 100,000 yuan are 13 counties, including Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujin, Nantong, Rugao, Changshu, Jiangyin, Wujiang, Yixing, Nanhui, Songjiang, Yancheng, and Zhenjiang (366,294 to 109,724 yuan). The remaining 48 counties, except for Yangzhong, which has only 6,722 yuan, all have more than 10,000 yuan, with an average of 76,147.05 yuan per county. Furthermore, comparing this year's funding with last year's, 40 counties have increased funding (the most significant increase is in Wuxi, with 76,313 yuan, followed by Wujiang with 46,953 yuan, Yixing with 28,769 yuan, Huaian with 24,929 yuan, Dongtai with 23,235 yuan, and Taicang and Gaoyou with 20,000 yuan each. Jinshan, Jurong, Danyang, Nantong, Baoying, Ganyu, and Qidong each increased by more than 10,000 yuan, ranging from 10,000 to several thousand yuan. The smallest increases were in Jiangdu, with an increase of 64 yuan, and Siyang, with 80 yuan. The remaining increases ranged from several hundred to several thousand yuan.) 21 counties have decreased funding (the largest decrease is in Wujin, with 33,459 yuan, and the smallest decrease is in Yangzhong, with 234 yuan). A total of 61 counties have increased elementary school funding this year by 222,802 yuan (last year's was 4,422,168 yuan).</p>
<p>(2) The total amount of education funding in all counties is 11,335,626 yuan (see yesterday's statistics). Among them, only Rugao has more than 500,000 yuan. Those with more than 400,000 yuan but less than 500,000 yuan are 4 counties: Wuxian, Changshu, Wujin, and Wuxi. Those with more than 300,000 yuan but less than 400,000 yuan are 5 counties: Nantong, Yancheng, Jiangyin, Wujiang, and Nanhui. Those with more than 200,000 yuan but less than 300,000 yuan are 12 counties: Songjiang, Kunshan, Yixing, Taixing, Xinghua, Zhenjiang, Gangshan, Jiangdu, Taicang, Gaoyou, Jiangning, and Liyang. In addition, those with less than 100,000 yuan are 13 counties: Yangshan, Yizheng, Xiaoxian, Chuansha, Huaiyin, Pixian, Suqian, Lishui, Jiangpu, Gaochun, Suining, Donghai, and Yangzhong. The remaining 26 counties are all between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan. The difference between the highest (524,184 yuan) and the lowest (33,346 yuan) is 490,788 yuan, which is roughly 15.72 times weaker.</p>
<p>(3) The elementary school funding accounts for only 41% of the total funding in each county on average. Only 10 counties, including Wu Town, Wuxian, Jiading, Rugao, Nantong, Yixing, Suqian, Chuansha, Xiaoxian, and Wujin, can exceed 50%. Only Wuxi and Wuxian can reach the legally mandated 70%. The smallest is Gaoyou, with only 9.7%.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education believes that the curriculum standards for secondary normal schools have not been established, and in order to adapt to modern needs, it plans to organize a drafting committee for normal school curriculum standards to formulate such standards. It is reported that the Ministry is about to organize this committee, and it is also reported that the Department of General Education, following the Ministry's intentions, has tentatively determined a list of experts in normal school education in the country to serve as committee members.

<p>This year, Nanjing Military Medical School and Beiping Veterinary School will simultaneously send letters to the provincial governments to recruit students during the summer vacation, according to the prescribed quota. Jiangsu is allowed to send three students for the 25th term of the medical department and general department of the Military Medical School, one student for the 18th term of the pharmacy department, and two regular students for the 17th term of the Veterinary School. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is in charge of the above-mentioned examinations. The results of the examinations conducted on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of this month showed that there were not many applicants and their performance was not satisfactory. Apart from the veterinary school's re-examination, which is approaching, it is necessary to inquire with Beiping Veterinary School whether to continue recruitment. The Military Medical School students are scheduled to continue recruitment on the 16th and 17th of this month. Both Military Medical School and Veterinary School are under the chairmanship of the Ministry of Military Affairs. Applicants should be graduates of senior high school to be eligible for admission. After entering the school, all expenses for food, lodging, clothing, and books are covered by the school, and a monthly allowance of four yuan is provided. Furthermore, medicine is a specialized scientific talent, and there are few researchers in the field of veterinary medicine in the country, but there is a great need. It is a pity that high school graduates with aspirations for advancement who have not had the opportunity to further their studies should miss this opportunity.</p>
