<h3>西園寺面授齋藤機宜</h3>
<p>認退出國聯尙非其時</p>
<p>夢想各大國再出袒日</p>
<p>齋藤由興津返京</p>
<p>今晨開緊急閣議</p>
<p>（東京）齋藤首相會見元老西園寺後、對日記者談云、此次爲决定日本國策上最重要之會見、因之不能不本人親自在訪、所談内容因關係甚大、暫時不能公表、惟本人認爲最滿意者元老西園寺已完全贊同政府已定方針　並予以强有力鼓勵、對退出國聯問題、元老表示不必太急、萬事須用冷靜態度、最好先考察二十一日國聯大會席上之形勢、始决定最后决心爲上策、蓋各大國未必盡是默視日本之被難而不救云、除此而外、並無談及其他問題、世人雖盛傳、此次會見與内政及熱河軍事有所計議、然此皆誤會耳（十九日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）今晨齋藤於會見西園寺元老後、曾向報界宣稱、謂日方日内瓦之代表圑在國聯大會開會前發表對案聲明書後、是否即將令其離去日内瓦、日政府現時尙未决定、日本代表離去日内瓦、並不能謂日本即將退出國聯、對國聯之日方對案、現已在外務省起草中、明日閣議將加以討論、大約該聲明書將於本月二十一日在日内瓦提出云、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）齋藤首相今日正午與西園寺正式會見、對國聯調解之經過·各國政府之外交態度·十九國委員會報告書內容齋藤首相曾加以詳細之報告、嗣後與西園寺在異常緊張空氣之下、討論對付十九國報告書之態度、與該報告書如在國聯大會通過後、日政府應取之對外方策問題、其他對侵熱軍事、赤在極秘密中計議、重要會見經過一小時二十分、下午三時二十四分退出、聞會見後之齋藤首相、抱有非常重大之决意、即時趕回東京、預備在明晨緊急　議席上、與各閣僚參考、决定最後根本方針（十九日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）緊急臨時閣議、定明晨十時在首相官邸繼續召開、大要議案根據十七日臨時閣議所决定反對十九國委員會勸告案、與召回日代表部·及實行侵略熱河軍事問題、對正式退出國聯問題、明日閣議當有最重要之决議、惟閣議後是否能即刻公開宣佈日政府之决意、則尙爲問題、或因事屬國際上重大關係、須待日代表回國後、另開重臣會議審議通過、始能發表（十九日華聯電）</p>
<h3>日本鄕軍大會</h3>
<p>（東京）日本在鄕軍人會以目下重大時局、不能默視、會長鈴木大將以下陸海軍首腦部参某、决定在鄕軍人會應採之態度、結果傳檄全國三百萬之在鄕軍人、定廿一日在靖國神社召集大會、　一路邁進（十九日電通社電）</p>

<h3>內田力主退出</h3>
<p>向東亞門羅主義邁進</p>
<p>(東京)內田外相因勸告附報告書、於日本之承認「滿洲國」發生龜裂、故日本除以退出之决意無他道、故照此態度、於十七日以來之閣議、對此點強硬主張、即於受西園寺公意旨之首相臨明日之閣議、內田外相亦所極力主張、确信當能貫澈該主張也、又同时內田外相關於退出國聯後之國際外交政策、現方與外務首腦部討論、照此情形、於通告退出时、一面將由從來之抽象的國際協調政策、急變爲與英美法意俄等諸國、各别的實質的協調主義、俾调整各國間之外交關係并於遠東則决定國中日「滿」根本安全保障之協定、而確立遠東門羅主義、以便依此方針邁進云、（十九日電通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）幣原前外相憂慮國聯形勢惡化、十四日曾赴興津訪西園寺、開陳重要之意見、據聞幣原最近向外務省某髙官表示、謂事勞至此、惟有退出國聯、向爲追隨外交本尊之幣原、竟有此言、殊堪注目（十九日電通社電）</p>
<h3>日人自慰心理</h3>
<p>料十六條不致援用</p>
<p>（東京）日人憂慮决心退出國聯、侵犯熱河时、國聯必認爲戰爭行爲、援用第十六條之制裁規定、加武力的或經濟的制裁於日本者、但據日外部所得情報、英法二大兩武力制裁無論矣、即經濟封鎖亦不視爲問題、縱令中國對於侵犯熱河提出訴願、然若認爲戰爭、恐有異論蓋認爲戰爭之國然負担兵力、不認爲戰爭之國、將斷定此種武装行爲、不能　戰爭行爲、故結果欲望國聯各國一致行動、殊不可能、又英國方面曾警告雖有不用武力之制裁行爲、然此種制裁亦違反和平、故小國之　部無論如何氣燥、提出制裁問題、然欲適用第十六條殊非易事云、（十九日電通社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）日本如不接受十九特委會之建議案、國聯將有何種舉動、此爲今日報紙社論所討論之問题、星期時報今後發展、大都將視美俄態度而異、如彼等完全與國聯合作、則日本地们將甚困難、蓋日本自覺孤立於世界之中、無與爲友者、將不得已而重行考慮此事、緃不立即改絃更張、但在感覺世人呵責之全部影響及在華作戰困難时、定必變其政策也、該報又言及在華戰事之可能性、謂軍火輸往遠東及外債二者之禁止、定可有穏健而迅速之效果、但最重要者、爲道德的裁判、英國無論如何、不致參加軍事的制裁云、觀察報亦謂國聯不致有施用武力之問題、因國聯施用武力、即無異自殺也、該報又謂國聯自始未鼓勵中日直接談判、殊爲失着、目前日内瓦唯一的良好目的、在消滅遠東之　恨云（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>美俄復交重提</h3>
<p>美參院正加考慮</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間要人及若干熟悉東方事件之外交家、細閲十九國委員會對於滿案建議後、多信其中谈判委員會之提議、等於一種外交之姿勢、因日本若拒絶再與國聯接觸、則將未必接受談判提議、反之、若日本接受任何調解提議、則談判委員會將無設立之必要、故即談判委員會之能否開會、亦屬疑問、某君更謂全部建議、亦有徒爲種姿勢之象、俾對於日本開啓將來談判之路、而解除國聯終止目前討論之責任耳、此外大多數外交家則懷疑於美俄之參加、且據日内瓦消息、俄國意見亦與美國意見相若、而俄外交家對於蘇俄參加之提議、亦大都淡然處之、惟邇來旣時當提出蘇俄參加解决一外國爭執案件之説、天然引起美國承認蘇俄運動之復活、參議員金氏預料主張承認派將設法早日開議美俄復交案、今日提出一議案、授權參院外交委員會開會蘇俄政治經濟狀况、並聲稱美參院目下尙缺乏充分報告、足以决定承認問題、故持提出此案、渠主張在委員會作成谓查報告以前、不應開議復交開題云、(十八日國民電)</p>

<h3>公然之戰與不宣之戰丨舉國之戰與一隅之戰</h3>
<p>— 乃</p>
<p>中日糾紛。歷一年五個月。夢想徒勞之調解。至今日而達水盡山窮之階段。何以言之。報告書經十九國特委通過之後。大會之通過。殆已不成問題。今後之國聯。將欲保持條約之尊嚴。對日本施以經濟壓迫乎。則遠東大戰之開始。自屬無可置疑之結論。將仍爲一紙空文。藉此以下塲歟。則中國今後對日之方策。自亦不能不改途易轍。而採取較堅决之手段。而日人近來之秣馬礪兵。咄咄逼人。不問其爲對國聯之恫嚇。抑爲對我國之示威。攻取熱河。要均爲其勢在必行之一着。故戰爭之續發。殆爲無可避免也。</p>
<p>清社之屋也。非爲滿漢種族之爭。而實爲權貴媚外誤國之結果。爾後北洋軍閥之覆亡。幾亦盡由於外交之失敗。辛亥革命。原爲中國發奮圖强之時會。然終以念餘年來迭起內爭。斷傷元氣。致九一八事變猝發。朝夕之間。淪亡三省。警耗傳來。束手無策。窮源竟委。則今日朝野名流。胥與有責。而默察旣往。警惕來茲。殷鍳不遠。覆轍匪遙。貽誤於前者。亦更不能容其再誤於後。當茲敵寇日深。民情騰沸之際。忍辱言和。固將受人民之裁判。而按師不發。遲徊却顧。以廻避抗敵之責任者。亦將爲舉國所不容。自全之道。救國之方。捨破釜沉舟。不顧一切。毅然决然以與暴日作戰外。要亦更無他道也。</p>
<p>何以爲戰。曰公然之戰而非不宣之戰。此一義也。何以言之。其一、則中日之戰。爲次殖民地反帝國主義之鬥爭。其制勝之道。非爲軍力之較量。而有賴於民族羣衆一致之抗爭。而欲民衆之奮起抗爭。則非有一公然之戰。無以激發人民之情緒。無以掀起鬥爭之髙潮。其次、即退而言軍力之較量。次殖民地對帝國主義之抗爭。所恃者非爲精良之利器。而爲奮不顧身之肉搏。此種奮不顧身之勇氣。亦有賴於當局者以嚴辭正義鼓舞於上。人民以戰死魂歸策勵於下。左右挾持。乃能堅持於不懈。示以義無反顧之决心。曉以非戰即亡之形勢。背水而陣。乃能死地以求生。師直爲壯。乃能愈顯其重要性。倘戰而又不敢公然以言戰。是爲戰而不决。在上者或自謂愼重以將事。在下者必認爲預留餘地以希冀妥洽。犠牲之意義未明。則直而壯之氣勢。必將挫减。以此與强敵周旋。成敗即難逆料矣。復其次。則目下政見之紛歧。爲無可諱言之事實。政見之所以紛歧。即因對外無斷然之政策。爲今之計。欲求衆口之噏然。亦唯有公然言戰。以釋疑解惑。惟事實爲最雄辨。有宋之亡也。人民主戰。而重臣主和。將士迴旋於兩者之間。感無可適從之苦。猶豫趦趄。其氣先餒。戰爭爲羣衆行動之一。衆志成城。則山岳震撼。首鼠兩端。則潰敗立至。歷史之陳跡昭然。吾人當知所以自處矣。</p>
<p>日舉國之戰而非一隅之役。此又一義也。何以言之。遠之則清代對外之戰。如中英之役。中法之役。中日之役。聯軍之役。均爲一隅之戰。伊藤博文告日皇之言。謂彼以舉國之力。當我一隅之師。制勝可操左券。實爲知己知彼之名言。一隅之戰實爲敗亡之道。殆已顯然。近之則一二八淞滬之役。一方有喋血之苦戰。一方有觥籌之交歡。設有舉國之戰。則海防即不足道。長江中流以上。何能容敵艦之存留。凡諸矛盾。貽誤戎機。其禍猶小。而啟人民之誤解。懈戰士之鬥氣。其禍乃大。要之苟且偸安。爲自私自利之心理。安民何境。亦軍閥割據之飾辭。兩者相交爲用。乃成此各不相謀各不相救之一隅之戰。其結果殆無異自動支解龐大之民族軀體。以供敵人之魚肉。</p>
<p>以故。所謂不宣之戰者。爲帝國主義攻略弱小民族最便利之方式。其攻略也。旣無任何理由之可資假借。復無法律約章之可資援引。如其公然宣戰。將適以自暴其罪惡。則何如默爾而戰。以取事實上之勝利。而彼日帝國主義者。旣有其堅强之軍力。更無待於以宣戰爲鼓勵士氣之工具。誠可謂有百利而無一害者焉。再則、所謂一隅之戰者。爲渺小國家併吞龐大民族最合宜之方法。以武力取其一隅。而以威逼利誘之手段。壓令他隅之勿動。假以時日。以俟漢奸隊伍訓練之完成。則以子之手。攻子之足。彼可坐享其成焉。東北淪亡。于今年餘。而長城以南。固仍爲日帝國主義之優美市場。一面以貿易掠取中國本部人民之汗血。移以供飬東北之漢奸隊伍。一面更以東北之漢奸隊伍。逐步侵略中國之本部。計無善於此者。國人而猶以不宜之戰與一隅之戰爲有利乎。吾恐其徒爲日人之工具而已。</p>
<p>總括上文。吾人認今日之戰。其一。對外即避去國際法上絶交宣戰之名辭。而對内。必須有公然作戰之堅决表示。其二。必須置全國於戰時狀態之下。使全國槍口。一齊向外。維持安寗。僅能認爲戰時鞏固後防之一種副行動。</p>

<h3>法意邦交惡化後德國亦起嚴重反響奥國處境進退維谷</h3>
<p>▲國民十八日維也納電自法國哀的美頓式抗議意軍火運往希爾登培兵工廠修理事後、奥國突起、嚴重危局、現料奥政府鑒於人民之憤激、當未必屈服於法人條件、諒其答復僅將重申前牒旨趣、說明此舉純屬私人事件、苟希爾登培兵工廠能獲得修理四萬枝舊式來福槍之成單、而其工作又不違犯和約、奥政府未見有干涉之理由、惟奥國在財政上現方依賴於法國、倘法國拒絶承募其應攤之國聯新債、將使奥國發生財政恐慌、故奥政府此時、實處於進退維谷之境、奧報評論此事、認奥國正方處於魔鬼與深淵之間、法人知之、故加壓力、使奥國成爲實施其政策之一易馭的工具、最後將迫其加入小協約、完成封鎖意大利之鐵壁、因此大多數報紙逆料杜甫士内閣旣遭遇此完全僵局、行將被迫辭職、惟此後之發展如何、則無一報敢於預揣、僅謂此事定將增加歐洲業已嚴重之緊張局勢云、</p>
<p>▲國民十八日柏林電德政界聞法英公使送致奥政府一威脅性質之牒文後、頓起慘痛之驚異、各報則不分黨派、咸表憤慨、稱其内容與方式、實爲前此所未見世界報謂該牒已不復欲掩飾其欺陵小國之心、當此軍縮會議正謀袪除戰後之歧視待遇時、吾人必需以逾越尋常之勇敢、剷除此類事件最後聲稱、舊協約國此種步驟、不能不影響於德政府之態度、國家社會黨機關報　稱、法人苟企圖逞大欲於奥國、以增進其自私的利益、决非德國所能容許、波森日報　稱爲法英兩國空前挑釁行爲、譏英人如此完全受法人多瑙河政策之覊勒、乃欲爲日内瓦之忠實經紀人、不亦奇哉、德意志報稱、英法此舉使歐洲時局愈益尖銳化、不啻對日内瓦宣判死刑云、</p>
<p>▲國民十八日羅馬電現在意大利全國關心最切之事、仍爲法國送致奥政府要求退回喜登堡軍火之牒文、意國人士對法國此舉、頗露憤慨之意、因認法國此舉、大部份係對意而發、目的並不在奥國也、刻自巴黎傳來消息、復謂法國此種牒文、實早已由法英二國共同向奥國提出云、但意大利輿論界、認此爲不足以减輕法國牒文之挑撥性質、並因法國僅擇毫無軍事抵抗力之奥國、加以凌辱、即對於捷克之每日將大批軍械運入南斯拉夫、則視若罔觀、尤足表示法國態度之不公允、此外意大利普波羅報、近又載意首相墨索里尼之談話一節、墨氏曾謂奥京維也納發見大規模之敵探機關、其首領則爲一法國之軍事參贊云云、墨氏因此認法國在南歐必已有軍事行動之計劃、且此種計劃全爲對意而發云、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯十八日匈牙利京城電匈牙利各報繼續評論巴爾幹小協商各國締結新條約事件、大體皆認爲各該國對内對外一種攻擊工具、馬其亞柴格報謂小協商各國、深恐德意奥三國相聯合、乃締結上項條約、以資對抗、未免過慮云、</p>
<h3>軍縮會議暫停</h3>
<p>德代表回國請訓</p>
<p>▲國民十八日柏林電德國出席國聯軍縮會議總代表那杜尼氏今日忽自日内瓦啓程返德、以便與總理希特勒及外長牛賴資面商軍縮問題一切事項、因法國近又提議廢止正式軍隊、組織地方民圑、並欲將全歐各國之民團組織、劃歸一律、德國對此已提出保留案、那杜尼與德外部通長途電話協商之後、即朿裝返國、而軍縮會議之政治委員會會議、遂不得不暫告停頓、以待德代表星期二日返此云、刻德外部方面、認法國所提議之軍隊劃歸一律之用意、不外欲將德國之國防軍拆散、故那氏之提出保留案、輿論界頗引爲欣慰、並願政府對於取　國際之間軍備均等之初衷、不可一步放鬆也、</p>
<p>▲國民社十八日巴黎電軍縮會議法國代理總代表哈德、日者在會演説、稱「軍隊爲罪惡、軍營爲叛亂之淵藪」、已引起巴黎大部份報紙之僨慨、僅法京與各省急進黨之報紙及半官性質之小巴黎人報、著文爲其辯護、右系各報則一致加以痛詆、要求立即召回該少不更事之政治家、法報對於此事、鼓噪頗甚、而對於致奥牒文甚重要之事、則殊冷静、説者謂其用意乃在轉移法國民衆之視聽、而不使知對奥所含之危險云、</p>
<h3>法俄批准不侵犯條約之意義</h3>
<p>俄報希望再增進經濟關係</p>
<p>▲塔斯十八日莫斯科電蘇聯政府公報「伊士凡斯太」今日著一長文、論法蘇不侵犯條約之批准、稱此舉已完成法蘇邦交發展之全段、據云、自法國所領導之干涉蘇聯政策失敗後、即由赫里歐開始一承認蘇聯之時期、惟此時一國之關係、亦尙起伏不定、當反動者執政時、法蘇關係即受威脅、反動者對法俄簽訂不侵犯條約事、極力反對、故目前此約之批准、有甚大之政治重要性、至於此次法政府批准此約之動因、該報謂與法國軍界之過甚重視蘇聯之經濟力及軍力、不無關係蓋自此種觀察、法政府得有二種結論、即再增强法國之軍力、或與蘇聯成立友好關係、幸而法政府所取者、爲其第二種結論、在蘇聯本身、此次不侵犯約之批准、可視爲其所持和平政策之一重要發展、爲保持和平及避免新戰禍、蘇聯願與任何國家合作、最近李維諾夫在軍縮會議之提議、引起不少法報之好評蘇聯甚望法國能了解李氏提議之基本意旨、不僅爲理論之贊助、且有實際之表現、惟國家所賴以生存者、非僅和平、亦需麫包、故法蘇眞正友好之表現、尤在二國經濟關係之增進、至法蘇之友好、爲歐亞和平之一要素、而非爲對付任何國家者、蘇聯之政策、爲與所有國家維持最密切及最友善之邦交云、</p>
<h3>斯福暗殺案羅</h3>
<p>續獲嫌疑犯五人</p>
<p>▲國民十八日米亞米電關於圍剿羅斯福案、此間又獲嫌疑犯五人、今日審問時、若輩已招認曾致函紐懷克之　斯述及暗殺羅斯福企圖、函内有「吾輩瓦匠同志失敗」語、但未公然提及暗殺企圖</p>
<h3>法國公務員定今日罷工示威</h3>
<p>反對削减薪俸</p>
<p>▲路透社十八日巴黎電據報載公務員聯合會將命會員於星期一日停止辦公一小時、表示反對削减公務員薪金、按此項削减財政部爲平衡預算計、業已議决▲哈瓦斯社十八日巴黎電各省市自治機關員後、及歐戰參戰軍人、對於參院財政委員　因節省經費所决定之辦法、極形騒動、頃公務人員聯合會發出傳單、指斥「參院挑釁行爲」仙省小學教員及自治機關職員委員會發表宣言、措詞激烈、此外公務人員各公會并令所屬會員、於星期一日停止一部份工作、其詳細辦法、當由各公會自行規定、歐戰退伍軍人聯合會亦擬結隊游行表示抗議、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯十八日黎巴電公務人員聯合會現方籌備在星期一日、舉行示威運動、對於參議院財政委員會關於减俸問題所採决表示抗議、一般人預料示威情形、將甚紛歧、是日若干機關人員、尤其是郵電機關人員、或將怠工若干次云、</p>
<h3>日本二次大地震之預斷</h3>
<p>震地將在紀伊半島</p>
<p>地層變動逐漸向南</p>
<p>▲據東京報知新聞載稱地震學界之泰斗今村明恒博士得帝國學士院之補助、就紀伊半島之地塊運動、已亘數年間之調查研究、本月十三日在學士院總會、發表可驚之事實、即南海道之南方、發現向南傾斜之狀、半島中央部亦然、最近四年間、復有南傾之勢、此與前年大地爆裂、頗有連帶關係、查南道冲過去已有數次地震、與從前關東大地震之性質相類似、當時在大地震以前、亦發生傾斜地動、該博士自受陸軍陸地測量部之援助、調查南海道將來發生之大地震、照測量部水凖調查之結果、發見半島南方之傾斜、已漸及於中央部、因　預　紀伊半島大地震之襲來、實難倖免、然在大地震以前</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>、更因傾斜地動之方向轉換、必發生大破绽、同時經帝國大學地震學教室之寺田教授·坪井助教等詳細之調查、因去年龜瀨隨道爆裂、填尾斷層之活動、在奈良·大阪·和歌山·三縣下、約有百基羅米突之沿線、最近突然發現地盤潛動十餘處、自此種研究發表後、全國均發生異常之驚慌云、</p>
<h3>日本龐大預算</h3>
<p>軍費佔總額三之一</p>
<p>公債増加一萬萬餘</p>
<p>▲路透十四日東京通訊據大藏省公布、一九三三至三四年財政年度之陸海軍費用、共逾日金八一九·○○○·○○○元、佔是年國用總額百分之二六·五七、國債劵費用已由上一年之二五九·○○○·○○○元、增至三七○·○○○·○○○元、但以國用總額百分比言之、已由三一·四九减爲二七·四五、是年因開辦救濟事業、故津貼項像算已較一九三二至三三年大增、計增多二二·○○○·○○○元有奇、然在國用總額百分比中則見减少云、</p>
<h3>俄日戰機</h3>
<p>蘇俄對日顏面盡失</p>
<p>日佔海埠政策不變</p>
<p>▲紐約時報倫敦通信云、日本在滿洲繼續進行之消息接續而來、此種情形之如何影響於　國大局、爲此間各方不斷之談話資料、中日爭端現爲日内瓦之間題、誠然、然日本在亞洲大陸活動之結果、形成一更重要之間題、似爲　般人所漠視者、即蘇聯威望之損失是也、哈爾濱爲俄國勢力範圍、歷數十年、今被日軍佔領已數月矣、此舉使旭日旗所到之處、此一九○九年俄日戰爭時更爲進步、而莫斯哥對此、僅提出一輕淡的抗議而已、據傳紅軍集中於貝加爾湖之東、以防被攻、但未有何重要事發生、日軍旣鞏固其地位於哈埠、藉口爲「滿洲國」討伐匪賊、繼續沿中東路線前進、一方達阿穆爾省邊界、一方向西至伊庫資克省、其佔領直已十足完全、日方如是侵入俄國勢力範圍、俄政府竟任其挑釁而不問、用俄欵建造之中東路及其關係之一切經營、似已完全喪失、日本予蘇俄之此項打擊、殆比其所予中國者爲更重、顧俄政府處之泰然、低首忍受、其爲俄政府之預耶、爲决計不干涉中日衝突之結果耶、抑爲自知力弱、不敢與日較量耶、又或爲俄當局恐一經作戰、將引起内亂、不克保其權位耶、要之、不論如何解答、蘇聯在遠東之威望、斷然已降至埀滅之點、不論遠東、即在歐洲、蘇聯對日屈服之反響、吾人亦已感覺之、如沿波羅的海之各小國、素來畏俄如虎、今其態度一變、芬蘭人·愛沙尼亞人·勒脫人·今似皆不復慮其東邊巨鄰之來攻、以中國諺語表之、蘇俄蓋已丢失其體面矣、吾人無論如何不喜莫斯哥之政府、而不能不承認此種情形、實爲一切在遠東有利益之國家之共同損失、而惜俄政府之軟化也、日本旣佔哈埠、橫跨中東鐖路、其抵禦紅軍攻擊之地位大爲鞏固、倘戰事果作、彼可遣出一掩護軍至西邊之興安嶺截斷海參崴與西比利亞間之交通、然後徐徐解决孤立於沿海省之俄軍、俄軍在满洲旣失其直接交通線、視可繞道阿穆爾流域以資運輸、然該方面之鐵路亦有十餘處可以迅速截斷、且此亦並非必要、因日軍祇須向赤塔方面突然襲擊、使阿穆爾鐖路與西比利亞幹路失其聯絡、則赤塔以東之交通即完全斷絶矣、倘依日本之計劃、繼續開發南满之農業、一方駐大軍於北满、則對於蘇聯勢力、可成爲一種緩助、換言之、日本組織满洲、使爲將來攻擊蘇聯之一龐大根據地、其第一步今在進行中、一九○五年之東京目的、爲佔領海參崴、使歐洲對太平洋無出路、卒以美國之干預、未逹目的、然其政策始終未變、大約今日企圖實現此舊計劃之時機、已不在遠、假使因日内瓦之破裂、日本退出國聯、則危機近矣、此吾人所可預言者也、（世界社）</p>

<h3>中國代表對日又一聲明（三）</h3>
<p>（樸資茅條約之精神）</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>日本代表對一八九四丨五年之中日對於朝鮮事件之戰爭、旣指述甚詳、中國方面、自不能再將當時爲日本外相之陸奥光宗所著之記事書、提請國聯注意、陸奥此書、其先並不公開、其目的則在爲其自己之政策作辯護、蓋當時頗有各方面指摘陸奥未能預防在中日戰後之俄法德三國聯合干涉也、書中對日本對華之陰謀及其麥基伐里式之手段、爲陸奥自已所手定、而逐一實行者、記述甚詳、其目的則無非迫使中國捲入戰渦、以達到日本大陸開拓及亞洲征服政策之一端而已、是書者、蓋即爲遠東大活劇之主謀者之一種記實、陸奥當時曾訓令駐韓日使、「用任何藉口以開始積極行動」、此乃陸奥自己所用之辭、日本代表當不能忘却之乎、</p>
<p>日本代表宣言書中、關於一八九六年之中俄協定一節又稱、日本政府於一九零五年日俄戰爭結束之時、若知有此項協定之存在、則日本對於滿洲問題解决、决不任其遷延至於今日、實則俄國在一九零零年至一九零三年中、旣已違反約文之規定、中國早已認俄國對該協定已認爲失效、且當日本在一九零四年、將對俄宣戰之時、中國極願與日本聯合、共同對俄作戰、以保守本國之疆土、然日本則阻止中國之參加作戰、當時駐北京日使奉到東京訓令後、即稱「日本政府對此事加以端詳之考慮之後、深覺有勸請中國嚴守中立之必要」云云、其勸請中國守中立之原因、則據日本自稱、乃在「國際秩序及一般利益之考慮、俾此次戰爭、僅限於日俄兩方、而不致蔓延至於他國」、易言之、日本不願俄國之歐洲聯盟各國得有助俄攻日之藉口也、</p>
<p>日本宣言書中、又稱、當時滿洲之得歸還滿淸、實以日本之力居多、即中國自身之出力、尙較日本爲次、吾人雖不願低减日俄戰爭之重要性、却不能不指出當一九零五年日本請美國促進對俄和平談判之時、美總統羅斯福即稱、美國希望日本能遵守滿洲開放門戶政策、將該地歸還中國、日本對此表示同意、故自一九零五年六月間開始談判之樸資茅條約、其有關於滿洲土地者、即係依照此種意義而締立者也、是以滿洲之歸還中國、果係何方之力、實仍爲一未决問題、吾人應記取日本代表在其宣言書中、固曾明白聲稱、日本决不躊躇、以把持滿洲境域也、</p>
<p>從另一方面觀、美國政府於一九三二年一月七日致中日兩國之牒文、內稱、美國改府將不承認任何事實上之形勢、或任何條約或協定之或可損害美國政府或其人民之在華之條約上的權利者、此種權利、並包括關於中華民國之獨立或其土地上及行政上之完整、或對於中國之國際政策、即所謂門戶開放政策者、美國此項表示、可見其目下之對滿洲政策、仍與其三十年前所宣言者、絕無二致、與日本政策比較、實有霄壤之別矣、</p>
<p>日本代表宣言中、又提出一九三一年髙紀毅與日代表木村關於滿洲鐵道問題之談判、以爲日本努力追求和平解决、而中國故事遷延之證、此案事實、實如下述、一九三一年一月二十三日、張學良將軍接到木村公函一件、對討論滿洲鐵道懸案以謀解决之需要　點、加以解釋同年二月五日、東北交通委員會主席髙紀毅、即被委與日本進行談判、三月六日非正式會議中、雙方同意各指派專家多人、參加討論、六日後、中國方面已指定專家六人、而木村則已回日、並通知髙氏、稱渠未能即日來瀋、直至五月七日、始由南滿鐵路會社通知中國當局、已指定日籍專家六人、及到六月間、滿鐵總裁職、內田康哉伯於七月中旬就新總裁職、內部人員、亦大事更動、其日籍專家六人中之一人入江氏、中國當局在鐵路問題上與之接觸素多、亦因之去職、入江去後、亦並無人承其缺、凡上種種、即在九一八事件前關於中日非正式談判鐵道問題之經過事實也、</p>
<p>從上述觀之、可見日本誣稱中國故意遷延、乃全非事實、蓋談判進行所以遲緩、其咎實在日本代表團及南滿鐵路會社人員之更迭、及日本故意遲遲舉出日方之專家、其缺乏誠意、蓋顯然可見也</p>
<p>日本代表於十二月八日特别大會席上演説、關於日本侵略中國國土一點稱、「日本在條約規定下在滬原有駐軍、其後日本政府即派遣陸軍赴該處、至於滿洲方面、則日軍之駐在該地、亦有條約爲根據、以保護日本人民之生命財産者也」日代表此説、與事實絶不相符、乃爲　種嚴重的誣言、日本所謂在南滿鐵路區駐軍之條約的權利、中國政府從未承認、且即使果有類似此種權利的陰影、亦早已於一九一七年失效、此在中國代表郭泰祺氏十二月八日在特别大會席上之聲明中、已言之甚詳、蓋日軍之駐在華土、在去年九一八事件之前、即爲一種越權行爲、夫日軍固絶未被請來我華土也、至於上海駐軍問題、日本代表公然聲言在條約上有派遣軍隊至該處之權利、殆尙爲任何其他日本發言人所未曾道、吾人應深深記取現在所有有效條約中、實無授權列强在滬駐軍或可視爲授權列强在滬駐軍之規定者也、</p>
<p>日本代表宣言又稱、「一九三一年十月八日、日本所派赴錦州以偵察該地華軍之日機十一架、係先經華軍機關槍之射擊、然後擲彈、焚燒華軍軍營以爲報復者」此説亦全與事實不符、李頓報告書第七十二頁、對此事有公正的報告、吾人但一披閲、即知中國軍隊當時並未開火、亦未還擊、報告書中又稱、以事實論、軍營絶未被攻擊、所有許多炸彈、均墜於城中其他各處、甚至醫院及大學校舍亦不免、</p>
<p>又有進者、華軍於去年十月間之撤至錦州、乃爲日軍武力佔據瀋陽及其他各處後所必不可免者、蓋華軍旣被迫退出瀋陽等處、自然應駐在當時遼寗省政府臨時所在地之錦州也、日本當局之所以派遣轟炸機一隊至錦以毁滅該城者、其至簡單之理由、亦惟在消滅中國政府在南滿洲之最後僅存之行政權威耳、日方所稱華軍之在南滿鐵路以東者、爲維持治安之一種障碍、純係欺人之談、蓋被日軍逐至錦州之華軍、决不能認爲有威脅性、且如此種論理、發揚而光大之、則世界任何各國、均得藉口鄰國國土有駐軍之故、即派兵佔領該地、試問在現代國際生活上、此稱事件、尙可任其存在乎、</p>

<h3>兩婦口角</h3>

<p>栗不問情由、舉槍向甄氏後腦開放一槍、彈由右眼角穿出、旋即倒地殞命、幸靈淵眼快、向桌下躱避、否則恐亦遭殃、栗反出圖逃、奔至北街廿四號自己寓所門前、見邏者前後紛集、難逃一死、遂舉槍向自己腦部開放一槍、倒臥地上、因未中要害、至旁晚六時許蘇醒、逕送羅別根路上海療養醫院醫治、但出血過多、延至昨晨八時許、在院斃命、</p>

<h3>奮鬬的徑在那裏？</h3>
<p>······海門江定遠村來信······</p>
<p>二月五月先生覆任望月君的「我的自殺觀對否」一信，極佩卓識，誠然的，自殺只是卑怯，可恥的，一種逃遁者的行爲，如果我們不曾忘卻人類的責任的話。但是先生，問題又來了；原來我們在這社會主義未實現以前，現代的社會是具有連環倚賴性的。你看，無論政商學界，他們都須具有一種關係，或大力的薦保，才可一登龍門。尤其是貧苦的子弟，好容易盼到成年，便爲饑寒所迫，僥倖的託人薦得了一頭生意；在父母呢，固然是希望着兒子向上，賺錢，或者衣錦榮歸！而在一方而又誠如任君所說的「有一種神經過敏的人，」不，我認爲這是一種頭腦清醒尙未麻木的靑年、这樣便很容易感覺着壓迫窮困的痛苦。他不慣現社會的黑暗，和人類的慘酷，他開始着奮鬬了，開始著爲全人類奮鬬了！但是，上面說過，現代的社會是具有連環倚賴性的，假如他與一切惡勢力奮鬬着的話，無疑的，他的地们，他的職業，便也從此打破。他將從此加入失業者的團體，他的四週，是怎樣不斷地譏諷和蔑視！他的家長，是怎樣地責罵和痛心！啊！他在這樣夾攻的環境裏，往何處去呢？重找職業吧？不能得資本家的垂憐；歸家吧，又是家無遺產。好，還是奮鬬吧！但奮鬬是不能枵腹從公的，環顧國內，又沒有堅強的奮鬬團體可以加入。社會還是黑暗，人類還是慘酷；他於是將更感着生活的苦痛，和奮鬬的失望，一切的切，將更迫使他趨人消極的自殺之途丨先生；我就是這樣的一個後顧可危；和徬徨着不知奮鬬途徑的靑年，雖然我的職業尙未脫手，但我總覺個別的行動，在沒有得到援救的辦法以前，是徒然的犧牲了眼前的職業！「自然有產業　奮鬬靑年除外。」先生，你看怎樣呢？也許你要卑視這種觀望的態度，和坐而得之的心理？然而事實如此。我極盼望着先生能明白的爲們們窮困的靑年指示出一個奮鬬的真實途徑！</p>
<p>答：我們對於『自殺』問題及對於『奮鬬途徑在那裡？』的問題的意見已散見以前對於各讀者的答復中，若足下留心細看，必可於字裏行間，得到我們對於此等問題的真實意見。足下所問，已無答復之必要。惟有兩點須鄭重爲足下告者：今日在奮鬬的，並非僅足下個人，許多人沒有出路，許多人在奮鬬，這力量是非常偉大的，你沒有看見許多人的力量，就覺得一個人孤立奮鬬，力量非常單薄，前途沒有什麼大希望，那是錯誤。這是一。自然與惡勢力奮鬬不是好白相的事體，而是你死我活的事體，若果，你怕失業，怕枵腹從公，那你只有天天拜倒在惡勢力的脚下，求升斗之粟以自活兼活其妻若子，還來說什麼奮鬬？你只管顧你『眼前的職業』爲了！這是二。總而言之；若果我們與惡勢力奮鬬，眼光只注在一身一家，一地方，一社會各自爲戰，不知團結，那就必無成功之理。而且與惡勢力的鬬爭，無論古今中外都是些失了業的反抗者（或因失業而反抗，或因反抗而失業，一池）與生活近於失業者或與失業者同其利害的人做的，絕沒有，（至少是百分之九十九）有錢有勢的人還來和惡勢力奮鬬，或是還未奮鬬，先請一個職業保險公司保你的險，那豈不是笑話？足下所謂『自然有產業的奮鬬靑年除外』這話怎講？足下曾見過多少『有產業的靑年』能以做堅决的奮鬬？並且所奮鬬者究屬何事？願有以告我；</p>

<h3>教部以佛教辦學須遵黨綱㈠</h3>
<p>復內政部咨送中國佛教會佛教學苑組織大綱</p>
<p>教育部前准內政部咨送中國佛教會所定佛教學苑組織大綱、其中重要錯誤、已分別論列、由部擬訂辦法二節、請派員會同研究、一面訓令原呈人、根憑此咨、重加修訂、限期再呈核奪、咨文及佛教學苑大綱如下、</p>
<h3>教部致內部咨</h3>
<p>案查上年、准　部禮字第四一九號咨爲據中國佛教會呈爲制定各級佛教學苑組織大綱請鑒核備案等情、咨囑查核見復、以憑　理等由、并附大綱一份、准此、查該大綱、級佛教學苑之組織、應糾正之點甚多、當此僧衆初具求學之自覺、知興辦教育爲自救救人要圖之時、雖不宜吹毛求疵、過事拘束、然國家所以經製定通行之大經大法所在、亦不能純任自由、致旣違普及教育之本旨、復背信教自由之原則、萬一將來耶穌天主以及回教、均衆相效尤、則支離蔑裂、尙復成何事體、茲將該大綱重要錯誤、分別論列、並將本部所擬定各種辦法要點分別詳述如下、切望貴部迅速選派專門人員與本部會同研究辦法、一面訓令原呈請人、根據此咨、重回修訂、限於三個月內、再行呈請政府核奪施行、以期政教雙方均得顧全、而國民文化之前途亦得其利耳、</p>
<p>第一節</p>
<p>查大綱第三條所定各等佛教學苑、以「培植僧伽人才、闡揚大乘教義發趣菩提化導社會爲宗旨此義與國法並無違背、但所謂「僧伽」之名、不能不加限制、隨意應用、查各國對於人民信教、均有限制、非依法律具有民法上成績之資格者、不得受任何宗教上歸依儀式之拘束、我國立法旨意、亦與各國通行原則相同、卽在佛教本身、其僧律亦是有明文規定、非年滿二十、得其生身父母及所屬國家之許可者、不得受具足戒而爲大僧、照此佛法世法兩方之原則觀之、可見當初立法之旨意、皆在尊重信仰者自身之自由、若其人格尙未完全、自由意議尙未充分者、不得以他人之意思、强迫其信仰任何宗教、法至良、意至美也、我國　代、政治宗教、兩俱墮落佛法世法、並皆衰退、各寺院僧人、濫收靑年徒衆、甚至乳臭小、兒已爲薙度、未滿成年、便作大僧、此種積弊、若不不根本剷除、後患何堪設想、若云地方貧民衆多、無告孤兒、投入空門者、不得不加以保育、以符慈悲之旨、則扶養並不限於薙度、教育並不限於學佛、該收養者更何須以人體爲私有、此義旣定、則今後在原則上、該大綱第三條所稱各節、只有設立相當於專門教育之學校、猶之各國大學之神學科、以及教會所設專門講求教義養成宣教士之大學、不得興辦初中兩級學校、蓋此兩級教育之本旨、在於養成健全之國民、無論何種宗教何種職業之人、皆須一律入學、不得因宗教不同而有所歧異、現在全國基督教徒所辦之學校、其中小　級均已一律受國定課程標準之支配、佛教何得再自立章程、願遵國法、至於中國現在情形、因政治不良教育不興及文化衰落之故、於是現在各地已經出家之僧衆、智識學問頗多缺乏、且程度參差不等、有戒律精嚴學行俱優者、有不議之無、不通教義、然於戒律尙能遵守者、有戒學俱劣者此種情形、等於中國一班社會之失教、該佛教會爲此等失教僧尼學問之補習計、只應就地設立各級補習學校、不得借用初中小學各級學校之制度、以妨礙國家教育制度之統一、此不合者一也、</p>
<p>第二節</p>
<p>查佛教所定戒律、不外施教受學之等級、中國前代、因佛徒衆多、非有限制、不足以保佛門之莊嚴、而維社會之秩序、故四衆戒牒、皆發自禮部、掌於僧官、凡一切行脚掛單、政府皆有嚴格之取締、現在信仰雖任人民之自由、而佛教關係國脈民命至爲重大、自不能過於放任、旣妨害國家民族之發達、復阻礙社會文化之進步、且近年以來、各國國民、來中國寺院受戒者、日漸加多、非明定辦法、從事整飭、不足以彰中國之文化、本部經再四討論、關於佛教僧侶出家受戒一事、擬定下列各項整理僧伽制度之原則、今該大綱所定各級學苑生徒資格、旣以受戒等級爲基礎、自不能不先由政府對於該項資格施以限制也、今將本部所擬各點條例如下、</p>
<p>第一·凡男女非年滿二十歲、不得出家、第二·凡出家爲僧尼者、須由該薙度師僧師尼呈報當地官廳備案、第三·凡男女出家者、非薙度後或受沙彌沙彌尼戒律後滿五年者、不得受比丘比丘尼戒、第四·傳戒之寺院、須將每屆受戒人名單履歷、於六個月前呈報當地官廳、分別呈報民政教育兩廳備案、第五·凡各地寺院、非具下列各項資格呈經內政教育兩部認可者不得傳戒、一、十方叢林、二、具備完全之大藏經曲、三、有研究專門宗教學術及教學之設備、第六·凡傳戒師僧之依止教授羯磨三師必須神通教義律法、得教育部之認可、第七·各地傳戒寺院、自民國二十三年起、滿五年內停止傳菩薩戒、同時限令各傳戒之叢林寺院、於此五年內、必須依照第五六兩項之規定、改良其內容、呈請內政教育兩部會同派員騐看、其經騐看合格者方許傳菩薩戒、第八·凡受菩薩僧尼戒之僧尼、必須受此丘僧尼戒律、滿足五年、且具備下列兩項資格之一、一、曾在在學畢業、及具備與大學畢業相當之學問程度、二、有合於本章程第四欵所定之叢林三所以上之聯名保證、其保證之要點如下、一、盡忠於國家社會之一切慈善事業、二、誠心扶持三民主義、不爲反乎三民主義之宣傳、三、終身不違犯國家法律、第九·凡曾經取得比丘僧尼戒及菩薩僧尼戒戒牒之僧尼、限於一年内、取具其薙度本寺及受戒本寺之保證書、呈請各該地方官廳騐看、加蓋印結後、彙案分別轉呈氏政教育兩廳備案、其未成年者之戒牒、一律取消、自民國二十四年一月一日起、凡戒牒未經騐看、未曾取得地方官廳印結者、一律不准担任各地寺院執事、並不發生一切法律上之效力、第十·第四欵及第九欵所定各種登記及騐看印結、各地方官廳得斟酌地方生活情形、收取手續費、但每件不得超過二元</p>
<p>中國人民信仰、以佛教爲最多、各地寺院僧尼、一方關係於地方之治安、一方關係於社會之文化、倘再不加以整頓、則民族與佛教、兩俱淪於衰運、該大綱所擬甲乙丙丁、各等教學章程、旣以戒律爲基礎、而忽略實施戒律之辦法、卽於佛教自身之改良進步、亦屬毫無所益、其違反國家教育制度之精神、更無論矣</p>

<p>中華隊擁有極强之精兵、前鋒五員大將、人才配置之佳、一時無兩、而卒遭失敗者、其原因欲知者必衆、請爲述之、中華之失敗、可以一語包括之、前鋒散漫無聯絡、中衛欠堅强、前鋒之如一盤散沙、於是進攻無力、可觀者萬衆華而已、中衛不堅、於是敵鋒續續而來、黃瑞華老將老矣、不能穩健恰人意、缺少準確之兩角送球、前鋒之力量減薄、後衛平平、不能遏止敵鋒之活動、於是雖有鐵門、亦不能不屈居人下矣、</p>
<p>昨朝前日敵軍大不同</p>
<p>蘇格蘭爲昨日阿伽而之變相、僅參加推納與赫雷二人、脫盡前日大敗於東華之頽態、生龍活虎、不可一世、脚脚有球、幾乎全局皆爲操縱、五前鋒聯絡之熨貼純熟、嘆爲觀止、射門之準確、亦爲罕見、中衛海氏赫雷、確是不凡、後衛未出大亂子、總之小表演觀之、其得勝、固亦宜也</p>
<h3>驚險無窮鐵門出風頭</h3>
<p>上場之十分鐘、風雲變色、中華隊門前、驚風駭浪、不一而足、使觀者目爲之定、以爲之呆、忙煞鐵門周賢言、左來右接、上下顧防、接應不暇、設非鐵門、早已不知漏進幾許、守門出風頭、大事不妙矣、中華先開球、蘇格蘭卽回攻、在離門二十碼、卽先得一任意球、於是是進迫無窮時、連珠砲直向門射、一次克拉格迫得周賢言無路、只能將球擲向半邊、前鋒之射門不真、中堅海氏、亦趕上猛攻、海氏在門前三十碼之砲彈任意球、急不可當、幸落鐵門手、角球復角球、一次克拉格之一頂、賢言之向上一接、美妙無窮、中華從此多事矣、</p>
<h3>重重壓迫一失再失球</h3>
<p>補壓迫十五分鐘時、果然先告失守、在門前混戰之時、休士之角球、恰巧落門前、克拉格跳起一項、球向上落下、　賢言已疲於應付、視線一差、球已落入而未可救、紀錄頓開、蘇軍仍不滅其盛、休士雖因鼻傷流血、十分鍾後即入場、此時中華會突破圍軍一次、孫錦順傳家球、萬象華盤上、無功而返、中華之危仍如壘卵、時已半小時餘、江善敬遠送過半場、萬象華衛上、傳李義臣而陳光耀、僅獲一次角球、孫錦順揭起一脚反勾有自己陣地、後方無防、克拉格匹馬單騎而進、又爲所中、中華以二比零失敗、</p>
<h3>局面打開果然成平手</h3>
<p>險象不脫、危機四起、離上半時完局之五分鐘無意之中、突然打開惡劣之局面、萬象華在左方進變、一脫勞格拉辛之絆、頓時前進、一脚傳中孫錦順得之、而傳李義臣、李對門力掃竟奏虞功、於是上半時之比數、中華一、蘇格蘭二、休息片刻後、蘇格蘭開球、仍取攻勢、孫錦順截得來球、遠球至李義臣、李送左角之萬、象華力攻、亨透擲出不遠、家球在此恆機會中、竟付之流水、繼而黃瑞華得球、亦向左方輸送、萬象華又見急進、將進角上、急挑門前、亨透得之而滑落、李義臣隨手撥之人、重戰僅五分鍾、二比二頓時平分秋色、萬不料後之十分中、中華隊突破此惡劣局面、</p>
<h3>十二碼球斷送中華隊</h3>
<p>平手之後、漸生希望、然而蘇軍仍迫攻不已、但此去彼來、各無成就、克拉格雖有機會、亦歸無用、天氣驟寒、大雪紛下、作戰如故、以爲或將和局、豈知於全局尙有一刻鍾時、禍患從天而降、拉蒙德前顧無人、匹馬衝上、李寗見勢燎原、後起而追、轉至拉前、脚起欲阻、反將拉蒙德絆倒、罰球區域內、於是被罰十二碼、推納踢中、鐵門不能如前日之再救矣、二比三乃歸慘敗、陣線如後、</p>

<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>以上所說是主幹人物方面，但是一個醫院的良窳，不僅關係主幹一人，各項職員，都應該有特別的訓練，上文已經談過從書記到院後都應該醫學化的，而最要緊的人員就是看護，我們中國因醫院少而看護養成的機會很少，因看護才難而要辦好的醫院更難，這是互爲因果，不是朝夕間可以解决的。本來醫院內部的一切管理，一切布置，側重在護士長的身上，醫師反而不必十分過問。外人辦一個醫院，從外國去請一位經驗豐富的護士長，帶十念個訓練有素的護士來，自然事半而功倍。中國人自辦的醫院，往往得不到好的護士長，還要醫師留心護士的工作，於是醫師愈加有才難之嘆了。我也曾請外國看護長管理過我的醫院，結果不甚圓滿，又如寳隆醫院的院長，用一個非看護人員，管理院内庶務，常常引起中國看護士的反感，曾經鬧過絕大風潮，就是院中其他各務，似乎也頗遭外間物議，足見這個護士長的重要。還有一層我們中國的護士，雖有護士會的設立，但權力和組織還沒有普遍，文字與制度都不能統一，而護士對於自己的地位往往誤認，因此有一部分護士，不肯以業終其身，或則注入雜醫界，或則竟改行，於是護士界的本身，絕少進步。所以我以爲國人要自辦合理化的公立醫院，在社會方面，必須集中欵項，優給取才，在醫界方面，必須訓練護士，犧牲私利。</p>
<p>其次再談私立醫院，查私立醫院，在上海市内，其能布置病房，容納病人的，現在不過四十餘家，床位總額，不滿二千，考其性質，無非三類：㈠是專科醫院，因爲專門醫師，要表現他的技術而設立的；㈡醫師中因爲沒有公立醫院的關係，而糾合幾個同志，試辦小規模醫院，以便容納他們私人病家的；㈢迎合社會心理，辦理療養院，以吸收高等病人的。此類療養院尤其以外國人所辦的佔着優勢，他們對於院内的規則，所絕對的通融性質，例如吸食鴉片，探望病人，致送食品，一切都很放任，所以達官富商，最爲歡迎。但是以上三種醫院，第一類因設備的代價，收費不能從廉；第二類因爲無欵可貼，必須靠收入的病房費作開支，並且要靠這醫院，來解决幾個醫師的髙等生活，自然也不能很便宜；第三類本以貿利爲目的，而來院的，又以富有者爲多，取費當然格外昂貴，因此這項私立醫院，與上海市的一般市民，簡直沒有關係。不過内中也有一二處是慈善家私人創立，帶着施診性質的，也有醫界中所辦，而自願將頭二等病房的贏餘，附設三等病房，加惠於平民的，可惜甚少罷了。</p>
<h3>論慈善醫院</h3>
<p>— 阮尙丞</p>
<p>醫院之設立。所以救治疾病之人。進而謀預防疾病之道。使社會之人士。俱得康健而臻壽域。故醫院不能謀預防疾病之道。更不能救治已有疾病之人。則有醫院。等於未有醫院。更有甚者。辦醫院管理不善。將使無病之人。變爲有病。已病而可救者。變爲無藥可治。馮等醫院愈多。則其害人愈烈。殺人愈衆。創辦醫院之初衷。爲救人。而結果適得其反。此則真救人而爲殺人矣。</p>
<p>國内之醫院多矣。論其創始。有政府出資者。有公衆捐募者。有私人解囊者。論其内容。有規模宏大。設備完美者。有因陋就簡。敷衍門面者。有不三不四毫無設備者。其間良窳不一。難以具論。今僅言慈善家創辦之醫院。因慈善之本心在救人。而不以利益爲前題。可以進言而求其改善也。</p>
<p>自國人漸知科學。新醫應運而興漸得社會之信用。慈善爲懷者。每慨然解囊。創設醫院。聘任新醫。施診給藥。以濟貧民。其意其事。固至善也。然創辦者。未必皆對於科學有相當之認識。以吾國科學落後之現狀而論。可無容諱言。因此之故。其所創之醫院。勢必難能盡善。蓋其管理之方法。選擇之人材。及內容設備。均未能以科學眼光定其去取。今試就其管理方法。選擇人材及内容之三要端。略而論之。未知芻蕘之言亦有可採否也。</p>
<p>㈠醫院管理之權宜屬於主任該院之醫師。或即爲該院院長之醫師。現代醫學完全根據科學。非有相當之科學常識。不能瞭解。醫學日益進步。則其施於實用之術愈精而愈繁。其設備嚴管理務求有益於病人。而不厭其日日改善。非若舊醫得一紙一筆。隨處可以爲人治病也。是以現代之醫院。皆宜託於醫師之手。若以醫院而視同舊醫之施診所。盡人皆得而管理之。則爲大謬。蓋醫院之設。基於科學。院中辦事人員。無論看護及庶務會計。下及僕役等等。均須受相當之科學訓練。至於房屋之建造。院内之設備。更無論矣。目下醫院通病。爲將醫院工作。分醫務及事務兩項。復以兩項之職權。處於同等之地位。而以事務之權。託之於全不知科學爲何物之人。遂至醫者醫其醫。事者事其事。醫師看護每感事務人員之工作。處處不能滿意。即或加以勸告。終覺徒費唇舌。而事務人員因與醫師處於同等地位。不願聽從醫師之指揮。於是醫務與事務之間意見紛岐。醫院工作。愈趨愈下。竟有事務人員。不滿意於醫師之治療方法。加以阻止。或參以非科學之意見令人可笑。因之醫師不能盡其所長。而其治病之效力大減。因之病者漸失其信仰。而醫院之名譽日益敗壞。此則誰之過歟。蓋醫院瑣屑之事。如院後廚子之訓練。病房廁所之清潔。藥品器械之配用。洗滌保存之方法無一而非事務。亦無一而能離於醫學範圍。醫院清潔與洗滌等手續之繁細。更非局外人所能夢想。醫院爲百病會集之地。有互相傳染病症之危險。苟事務而不醫學化。則不病者可以致病。已病者病上加病。故醫院無事務。事務者即醫務耳。斷不能强分爲二。更不宜將事務屬於毫無醫學智識之人。而不受訓練。不聽指揮。往往使醫師辛苦得來之成績。敗於俄頃。故醫院管理人員。宜職醫師之指揮。否則即足危及病者之生命也</p>
<p>㈡創辦設備完全之大醫院。固非易事。爲適合目下吾國之環境。自顧多設小醫院。以求普遍。但小醫院之設備亦不宣邊於簡陋。例如房屋之建築。内都之佈置。藥械之購備。院務之分配。仍得請教專家爲之計劃。否則大好金錢。等於虛擲。即最底限度。亦當以龍應付其十之八九。爲率蓋以經騐所得。重症而需大醫院之設備者。究屬少數。否則院中設備。尙不能應付大多數之尋常病癥。豈非等於虛設。若專事敷衍更覺誤人不淺。故醫院設備自不能過於簡單。不然則不成其爲醫院矣。</p>
<p>㈢醫院聘請醫師關係至爲重大。其最應注意者。即該醫師之是否有正當出生。若以有正當出生之醫師。所費較髙。爲節省經費起見。即以類似看護出生之醫生以充任之。則病家之受其害者。尤非淺鮮。此層當請當地之衛生機關。或醫師公會。代爲選聘。則萬無一失也。</p>
<p>總之醫院者。非若舊時之育嬰堂孤兒院等。可以無科學常識之人。而董理其事。醫院辦理不得其法。足以誤人生命。慈善爲懷者。尙希加之意焉。</p>
<h3>醫德</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>丨值得注意的問題丨</p>
<p>有人說，醫生是只講「術」不講「德」的，「道無術而不行，」已成爲一種傳說的定診，醫生是否可以只講「術」不講「德」呢？要了解這個問題，當然要先了解「德」字的意義。</p>
<p>人們共同站在生活的路上，對個人，對社會，對國家，對世界，似乎皆有一種應盡的任務和應負的責任，如何行使這種應盡的應負的任務和責任，呌做「行爲，」個人有個人單獨的行爲，團體有團體合羣的行爲，行爲是要有一定的標準，一定的規律的。所謂「德，」換言之，就是行爲的標準。醫生行爲的標準呌做「醫德，」在外國則名之曰：「醫業倫理學·」</p>
<p>「醫業倫理學」在外國已成爲一種獨立科學了丨在中國却至今沒有人注意過，假使拿這個問題來問人，一定得到一個奇異的答復：「醫生那裏有所謂倫理學，醫生那裏談道德呢？」就是醫生本身，也不承認有這樣一回事，這是怎麼原因呢？一言以蔽之，就是社會不能了解醫生，醫生也不能了解自己。</p>
<p>醫生不是專替人診病就算了事的，在國家方面，一切的衛生行政，在在與醫生有關，在社會方面，一切的衛生事業，亦無一不與醫生有關，醫生本身的團體，則同道之間，無時無地設有紛繁的密切的接觸，至於民衆的壽夭與强弱那更不必說了丨所以醫生不單是民眾健康的導師，實在是民族强弱的操縱者。醫生的任務旣這樣的繁，責任旣這樣的重，醫生的地位自然日見要緊日見崇高，醫生的一舉一動自然爲社會所注視。吾們如何的拋負這樣重大的責任，行使這樣紛繁的任務，稱定這樣崇高的地位，吾們的行爲又怎樣能沒有一個正當的有規律的標準呢？</p>
<p>近年來中國的醫界可謂紛亂達於極頂了丨有忝職業的欺騙手段，有損道義的同道競爭，一幕一幕的層出不窮，這就是醫生根本沒有能夠了解自己的責任和地位，也就是根本沒有一種共守的標準行爲。這一種勢如亂絲的現，象吾們將怎樣補救牠呢？</p>
<p>這實在是一個重要的問題，關心這個問題的朋友們，大家來研究一下吧！</p>
<p>上海醫藥評論社瞬屆日期，擬出一　　醫業倫理問題研究專號，同道或非　　同道如有對本問題有研究興趣者，　　請詳細討論，惠寄醫藥評論社編輯　　部。（上海馬浪路新民里四號）當於　　醫藥評論中次第披露也。</p>

<h3>設立梅毒免費治療所病院議</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>現在社會一般人士，差不多都曉得醫學和社會關係很重大的：尤其是急性傳染病（時症）與社會方面安寗更大，所以設立時疫醫院的確乎不少。并且明白生這種病的貧苦階級最多，對於完全免費一層非常注意，這是一個很可喜的現象。但是有關於社會安寗的並不止是時症一類。我們知道，梅毒結核痛腫三者是世界三大病，生的人都特別多。關於痛腫一症，一直到現在，他的原因和治療還沒有具體辦法；現在且捨開不談。作者本人早年曾在時疫醫院服過務的，在門診方面，所有一切病都免費治療的；所以結核和梅毒二病並不少。但一般人態度，對於患結核的確實也很表同情：但總覺得愛莫能助，因爲這種病須長期方好，就是藥費也不容易負擔，主治藥尤特別貴。至對梅毒一症，則都以謂是「自取之害」，雖病不足惜，完全用道德觀念來敝視病者。我覺得捨開事實而以道德眼光來判斷，這種思想是非常錯誤的，所以特別提出來討論。</p>
<p>大凡一種罪惡，决不能怪個人，環境總不免多少有點關係：就是有罪惡，也應該以事實爲前提。我們衹須曉得梅毒是（廣義指一切花柳病在内）是一種社會病，患的人和肺結核一樣的多，對傳染一方面蔓延無停止時；假使本人的病沒有全好，一直到他的子孫均羅其殃，間接與民族體質（優生學）發生關係尤多。（關於遺傳上的影響，肺結核雖可能，尙沒有梅毒這樣的顯著：因結核是否可由胎盤沾染產兒尙成問題，故比較起來，梅毒於全民族之健康關係較結核症爲深）。所以我們可以說：多一個梅毒病人，國家和社會即多一無窮之害：少一個即多得一分利益。根據這個理由，梅毒治療所（病院）爲刻不容緩之興。此外的幾個理由，現在且一一詳述於下：</p>
<p>㈠我們曉得，梅毒的特效藥是艾利氏的六○六，此外像碘劑水銀劑和新出的铋劑也都有卓效。但根本治愈，决不是注射一二次六○六就能達得目的的；他注射的總量爲三·○至四·○克，差不多須分十數次方行，爲期須五六旬光景。但一種非正式開業的醫生，他們總說他的藥特別效果大，用不着麻煩這許多手續和時間；甚至將每次注射量特殊增加，以求速效，而不顧另外的流弊。這種治病家非常聽得進，說所費少而收效快；係另外須連注射十數次方能全愈一派的話，病者返以謂是在欺騙他。這種是非不明。爲害當然很大。我們知道，梅毒一症有固定發作期數，現種種不同身體上變化；其間也有間歇期，幾乎和全愈一樣的。譬如初期患的是硬性下疳，此變化有時無特效藥也能自愈，但數星期後即發生全體變化；此種自愈是一種必須經過的階級，但慣於欺騙的人一定說係他醫好的，後來的全體變化是病家不慎或第二次傳染。就是病家也非常相信。所以儘敢有許多自以梅毒已全愈的病家，而日後患大動脈瘤脊髓癆腦生血等症的很多；儘敢說他的淋症已好，而其後患單性關節炎副睪丸炎膀胱炎也時常看得見的。但大多數的病者，總以爲這是另外一種病，和梅毒淋症是沒有關係。所以患梅毒淋病的人可是不少，而完全治愈的，我敢說還沒有十分之一。這種情形，醫師雖明知其所以然而不能補救。我想只有設立免費治療所，方可使是非明白，曉得梅毒根本治愈的法子。</p>
<h3>中國之肺病問題（續）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>人工氣胸之適應症</p>
<p>㈠難於制止之重症肺出血，及反覆無常之時時肺出血，人工氣胸使患部緊張緩解，由於力學的機械作用，以致止血。</p>
<p>㈡一邊性之重症肺結核，凡一切急性之肺癆，應即施行人工氣胸，即使他種療法，已經絕望之時，亦宜施行本法。　　㈢輕症肺結核病在初期，若即施行本法，則身體受毒尙淺，他肺亦多健全，則當然可於短日奏效，凡經過普通療法，或長期之安靜療法，而無顯明之效果，或有進行性之趨向者，以及病者之經濟狀况不堪長期安靜療法之負擔時，均應早期施行本法，以期速效。</p>
<p>㈣結核性肋膜炎：肋膜腔中之分泌物，雖經手術排除，惟日後多重行蓄積醫者往往束手，若在排除其分泌物後，同時更用人工氣胸，則事半功倍，爲例甚夥。</p>
<p>欲察知病變之病理，解剖上的性狀，雖屬不易，然吾人若用愛克司光線精密檢查，則判决肺結核之種類，何者爲適於施行人工氣胸，或不適於施行本法，均能洞見癥結，正確診斷，而無庸其疑虞矣。</p>
<p>抑有進者，人工氣胸之手術，雖極簡單，但非一般醫師均能旅行，且同時必須有愛克司光線之檢查施行，方能較妥確實，故須在專門療養院中行之，方可解决此項問題。惜一般病家，或困於經濟不能長期療養，或對於此法不能有相當療解，一再因循，以求幸愈，而醫者亦以病者多苟安圖幸之心理，日事敷衍，一再蹉跎，坐令病勢進行，或當時雖暫收斂，而日後復覆發，怵目傷心，莫此爲甚，故目前欲解决中國肺病之治療問題，消極的衹有普及人工氣胸治療。各地多設肺病療養院，爲當今之要務。　　此外如橫隔膜神經拔除術，填補術。胸廓改形術等，均屬於專門，茲不贅。</p>
<p>肺部經過人工氣胸術後之愛克司光攝影。一月後熱型全無。體重增加十二鎊。</p>
<h3>醫師的社會任務（二）</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>我們醫師不但努力於救治病苦的民衆，爲唯一的任務：我們更加要注意於民衆在未病時的預先防禦，使他們知道預防的重要，使他們明瞭一大半疾病的罹獲臨身，還是由於平日未加事前的預防之所致，說到他們所以在日前生活時之未加事前預防的原因。倒並非他們不顧去預防去避免，凡是有生機的動物，有生命的人羣，誰不願享受康健的快樂？誰願病痛疾苦的危害臨身呢？實實在在，還是因爲他們的無知無識丨他們不但未病時不知道預防的道理，衛生的智識，到了罹病以後的臨時，也不曉得應如何的適當處置，現實的生活，固然使他們沒有機會去求得保身衛生的智識，經濟的能力，更使他們無能力可以去獲得這種智識了。他們的缺乏醫學智識，可以說是全由於社會的環境，由醫藥智識的缺乏，逐漸促成他們旣不明白衛生之道，對人體康健的益處，也不知道不合衛生，對於人身的危害了。人羣中一大半的疾病旣然曉得是由於平日不講求衛生，不明白衛生醫藥的智識爲何物的緣故，那末，假使一般人都能講求衛生，懂一點普通的醫藥智識的話，丨丨當然的，這也要社會給與以獲得醫學常識的機緣與講求衛生的環境才是丨丨我敢大膽的說一句，許許多多的疾病，尤其是與飲食起居最有直接關係的傳染病，如霍亂，痢疾，傷寒，白喉，天花，鼠疫等等，都可以避免得了的丨這種因一般民衆不講衛生，缺乏醫學常識，至爲疾病所危害，而喪失了生命的，不知有多少呢丨這種人命的被喪失，康健的受侵害，直接由於一般民衆的缺乏醫學智識，間接不能不說是由於惡劣的社會環境所造成，醫學對於人類生活的需要，旣具這樣的重要，而一般民衆的醫學智識，又那麼的幼稚，這中間無形中劃成一道巨大的鴻溝，所以要使民衆者享用醫藥的福利，避免疾病的來臨，達到人生康樂的目的，無疑的必須打破這一道鴻溝的障礙，再明白地說，就是使民衆自身認識衛生智識對於康健的利益，醫學常識對於人身的重要關係了，這工作就是宣傳工作了；這宣傳工作的責任，無疑地是在以救人濟世爲職責的醫師層背上了。我們的中國民衆，因在這樣糟糕的社會環境，這樣惡劣的生活形態之下，却使他們易罹疾病，使他們無能力無機緣去獲取避免疾病的衛生智識，以衛他們的生，保他們的健，可是，反過來說，也就是因爲缺乏醫學智識，不懂衛生道理，才更加使他們的生活環境糟糕化，惡劣化，才更加促進他們陷入於不衛生的非人境地呢。這可以說，是我們中國社會裏一般民衆，尤其是下層民衆的實際情境，救濟這苦海境况中的民衆疾苦，在我們醫師的範圍中唯一的方法，就是上面說過的宣傳工作。把醫學的普通智識灌輸給他們，使他們交醒，使他們明瞭，在可能的範圍中，來改善他們的不衛生的生活環境，以避免疾病的侵害，維持生命的健康。</p>
<p>這只就普遍無識的民衆而言，即一般的智識分子，表面上說起來，對於普通的醫學智識，似乎應該有相當的認識，然而實際上並不是如此，雖然不能全體來說，可是至少是一大部份的智識階級，他們對於醫學智識，實在是十二分的淡視，對於醫學常識的幼稚缺乏，實在是幼稚缺乏的異常，這大概是中國社會的特殊情形吧，讓我來舉二個實例來說說·從前有二位素常認識的病人，他們前後同患染了白濁症·再找我診治的時光，都異口同調的提出白濁是否會變成梅毒的問題詢問我，更有一位頗具新智識的智識分子，也問我腸熱症是否要變成瘧疾，這雖不能以醫者的眼光，來指摘他們的醫學智識的淺薄，可是也足見智識階級，而且是新智識界的人們，對於醫學常識的不注意和幼稚了，新智識界的智識分子尙且如此，其他的各界，更可想見了，這樣就可見得，不但一般的民衆急需着醫學常識的灌輸，就是普遍的智識界，也未始不需要醫學智識的宣傳啊。</p>

<h3>好在那裏</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>咱們中國人，一百個倒有九十九是打折胳膊朝外曲。何以見得？哪，中國人不拘怎麼挺硬，日本人不拘怎麼樣膿包，說琮說去，總說日本如此這般好，中國一輩子莫想弄到日本那麼好的百分之一。罪過罪過，不當人子，乾脆說一句，　中日同種同文，正是半斤八兩。欲知究竟，請大家把良心安在正中，忖一下子。</p>
<p>住在中國，望着中國嘆氣的人說：中國革命以來，二十餘年，政治未上軌道，武人跋扈，政令不出都門。中國的財政，衹知加徴挖空心思的稅，不顧民生疾苦，弄得民窮財盡，天怒人怨。中國不拘怎一處，滿佈着土匪强盜與共產黨。丘八大爺，專會內亂，一見日本人，腿　軟了，說起了真氣人。中國商人，推銷洋貨不用說，政局一有變動，公債馬上跌落，自扳石頭自壓脚，不知國家爲何物。這種現象之下，中國不亡給日本，真沒有天理。</p>
<p>且慢，日本的一切政治，都　仰軍人的鼻息，內閣等於一傀儡，議會也等於一種點綴品，請問這是否是政治已上軌道的憲政國家？日本國民每人要負擔國債八百元，是否是民不窮百財未　？不穩思想　淡全國，首相都被人刺殺，警察，軍隊，乾麼用的？數十萬大暈，見了東北義勇軍，索索地顫，見了上海老百姓，都當便衣除，也已夠丟臉！國聯態度一變，東京公債市場，一瀉千里，愛國的日本商人，也未見得肯挖腰包，維持市面哪！</p>
<p>日本同中國，正好拜把子。胳膊望外曲的同胞，不要儘說老婆是人家的好！</p>
<h3>花瓶</h3>
<p>— 張寗一</p>
<p>丨甘受此稱呼嗎丨</p>
<p>花瓶·擺式品也，其由來已久，在平時人們絕不注意它，除非有時買點花總想到去養在裏面，要是這花瓶是古董，人們還得藏之髙閣，未肯輕易示人呢！</p>
<p>但在去年「花瓶」二字猶似旗衫般的風頭十足，在報上這二字時常會出現，這樣廿世紀不是成了個骨董世紀嗎？曰，不然，此花瓶非插花之瓶，乃摩登女性底別名。以這樣一個無靈性的物件去稱伊們；在這女權高張底　代豈不罪過？但是我們的道學先生却在快樂地哼着髙調說：「彼自取其辱也，於我們何焉」。何時我校的S（敝校的所謂文學家）也在發牢騷的寫着「······女人·蛇一般的女人！打扮得妖妖嬈嬈的，想引人注目？受侮辱是應食之果，······」拉了一大堆話，言歸正傳吧。</p>
<p>「花瓶」二字是在去年交進了鴻運，自從寫字間裏有了女職員，人們說伊們無非是做經理先生底花瓶罷了！是事實與否，不管，不過這樣「花瓶」二字就紅絕一時，同時凡是摩登女士統榮膺了這二字，女士們，你們甘受嗎？要不然，小子有　法貢獻。</p>
<p>今年是國貨年，當然，各公司商號：國貨多於洋貨，甚且非國貨不賣！（在我以爲至少這樣纔名副其實）那麼女士們，乘此也來服用國貨，穿土布或中國綾羅綢緞，本來人之美貴在自然，單靠脂粉衣飾的遮蓋是沒用的，這樣一來，旣盡了愛國之心，而樸實之服裝又使人無所藉口，豈非兩全其美！</p>
<p>不過這樣一來：卻闖下了一件禍，因爲一般文學家以後寫到女人；不能再寫什麼「女人，這滿身遮蓋在舶來品下底女人！······」但是我却管不了許多呢？</p>
<h3>火呀！</h3>
<p>— 許可慶</p>
<p>火！你是一樣多麼偉大的東西？</p>
<p>我想：世界上再沒有比你更偉大的東西了！可是，火呀！你是用非其道了！你！爲什麼要把窮苦小販的茅廬焚化？你！爲什麼要把平民百姓的住宅燬滅？你！爲什麼不把那些不肯做善事的富翁，喜歡燒香的婦人，揮金如土的靑年，爲虎作倀的漢奸，以及侵略中國版圖的日寇，無惡不作的强盜土匪，善於詐騙的流氓癟三，······一一都送他們到火窟裏去？</p>
<p>因此；整一個的社會，還是不安靖，整一個的中國還是　内亂！</p>
<p>火呀！火！我忠告你！请你顺从着我「良藥苦口」的忠告！去實現你　偉大的工作！</p>
<h3>男女不平等</h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>丨男子們太頑固固了丨</p>
<p>老子的眼兒一閉，腿兒一挺，遺下來上千上萬白花花的大洋錢，基於「父產子得」的原則，一古腦歸傳宗接代的兒子承受，不拘你是已出閣的姑太太，姑奶奶，或是未出閣的大小姐，二小姐，一概不得過問。但是假使老子遺了一屁股債下來，那麼，基於「父債子還」的古訓，也歸積穀防　的兒子負　，「嫁出女兒潑出水」，做女兒的，也死也不負責的。男子旣享了承受遺產的權利，盡負擔遺債的義務，跑遍了天下，也找不出再妥當的公理來了。但是現在是男女都要說一個平等了。可是我們翻開報來一看，只有女子要求與兄弟分析遺產的訴訟，可從未見過男子要求與姊妹分擔父母遺債的案子。法律上對於遺債問題，子女是否有分擔的規定，在下沒習過法律，不甚明瞭。但是我以爲做男子的，爲扶植女權起見，應當趕快把遺債分一些給姑太太或姑奶奶，切不可獨吞。</p>
<p>還有一個問題。現在女子，漸趨職業化，不拘甚麼事，都愛說一個「自由」「解放」。這些怪好聽的名詞，本來是蹂躪女性而負家庭經　責任的男們所獨享的。如今女子是「解放」了，女子是有了「自由」了。女子可自求職業，同丈夫離婚，一切都平平了。男子也沒有「蹂躪女性」的不平等權利了。但是對於「負擔家庭經濟責任」那回事，男女們兀是不肯放鬆，野蠻之至。你瞧，報上儘載着妻子控丈夫不願贍養的消息，從未見丈夫控妻子不負家庭經濟責任的事情，這還不夠證明男子們的不肯同妻子平等麼？</p>
<h3>如此湖山</h3>
<p>— 湖畔閒澫</p>
<p>丨西子湖畔的春訊丨</p>
<p>孤山的梅花給冬末的大雪，爭先在遊客的胸懷，佔去了勝利，伊便像似受了莫大的恥辱，總是一個含苞不放。</p>
<p>費了許多寒假期間，閒散着，靑年男女，三番四次的從湖濱起程，不遠千裡的去探訪伊，可是伊還是隱藏在槎枒烏黑的老枝乾的腋下，微微地吐露出幾點細小的嫣紅，嬌羞也似的，任是怎樣不肯給這班專誠去探訪伊的知己，淋漓痛快的飽餐秀色。</p>
<p>可是愛跳愛笑的靑年男女們，對那接連不斷的雪花，已經感不到興味了，蘇隄和白隄上的紅桃綠柳，也已經躍躍欲試的，預備展開他們美麗的花冠：料想那撒嬌不肯輕出的梅花呀，伊决不會再放棄了這萬人擁惠，萬人渴望伊珊珊地來臨的機會，不久便將燦然地坐上了伊的王位吧！</p>

<h3>靑春之火</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>凱君義不容辭，很忠心的教導伊，希望伊能夠實現伊的理想，達　伊的希望，那麼自己雖然耗費些光陰，也是做了一件美事。但不知伊家中的人對於此事，不但沒有感激他能相助，而反有些不放心，竊竊私議。幸虧凱君平日的爲人，一些沒有給人可以指摘之處，且又有他的母親監督在旁，所以說不上什麼壞話。</p>
<p>光陰很快，過了幾個月，却使凱君有些不滿意的地方，因伊雖然自己說要立志補習，但是時常要曠課的。一暴十寒進步很慢，一本書還讀不滿三分之一，豈是凱君的始願呢？并且發見伊最近時常寫信，有寫不出的字時，來向凱君請教。凱君以爲伊的朋友很少，何以魚雁這般頻繁？又聽得有些人傳說伊新近在外認識了幾個異姓之友，所以書信其多。空穴來風，並非無因，凱君安能無疑？但這事凱君無權過問，且很客氣的，不便說什麼。却不願意伊因爲得到一些小智識，而反自趨歧途，這是凱君引以爲憂的</p>
<p>夏天來臨，伊讀書的時候也改在早晨。可是有一天，凱君有事出外，從一清早出去，直到傍晚回來。他洗好了浴，披着一件紡綢短衫。手執一柄芭蕉扇，正坐在庭中乘凉。驀地瞧見伊手裏拿了一本書。從那邊姍姍地走至，對凱君說道：「你現在倘沒有事，可否教授我一課？昨天的生字我都背得出了。」凱君此時正想要暢快地納凉，不願意到燈光底下夫上這功課，可是被伊這麼很墾切地一說，他也不能拒絕，只得點點頭道：「好的」。於是二人走入書室中去。凱君把書桌前一盞電燈開亮了，伊就在他的對面坐下。這時凱君的眼光觸到伊身上，忽然有些異樣，原來伊身上正穿着一件粉紅滾邊的單胸白紗襯衫，是沒領的，把伊雪白的粉頸完全露出，衣袖也短到臂灣以上，胸前雙峯突起，在燈光下瞧得更是清楚，兩粒像扁黑棋子一般的東西，多麼惹人情緒啊丨琮因爲伊的襯衫十分短小，以至褲腰都露着在外面，淡藍色生絲褲子上繫着一條粉紅色的絲帶，埀在一邊，這皆色彩，挾有很大的魔力，幾乎使誠實的凱君不敢作劉楨之平視。更兼着鼻子裏嗅到一種甜蜜蜜的香氣，當然也是從伊身上送過來的了。（四）</p>
<p>婦女的樂園</p>
<h3>女性歷史</h3>
<p>— 沁沁</p>
<p>「世界上應是先有女性，或是先有男性？」這一個　問，似乎和「先有雞蛋後生雞，與先有雞後生雞蛋」一樣的沒有人解答。</p>
<p>雖則說看舊創世紀，都知道是上帝先造亞當後造夏娃。這一句話似乎不能作爲認證。</p>
<p>不妨考查我們中國的歷史，簡單舉幾個例：</p>
<p>水經注：「地鼻氏十一君皆女面」</p>
<p>山海經：「有神十人曰女媧。」</p>
<p>「黃帝之母曰附賓，見大電繞北十，樞星照郊野，感附賓，孕十四月，生黃帝於壽水。」見帝王祀。</p>
<p>我們現在中國人都稱是黃帝之子孫。黃帝的母親是感了大電樞星而懷孕的，那們我們中國人的始祖，應該是女性。</p>
<p>至於女性單獨能懷孕的話，那到有很多的例可以援舉的，現在不妨舉一個人盡皆知的明例：</p>
<p>念新約全書都知道瑪利亞是童貞女，受了聖雪的感動，繼生了耶穌基督。這是中西相同之點，是一個不容人否認的證據。</p>
<p>以上所引的，也許有人認爲都是些歷史上的神話。</p>
<p>我們不妨談字的方面，所謂一姓的「姓」字，拆開來是「女生」兩個字，那們說自有姓以來，我們始祖是女性無疑了。</p>
<p>就像黃帝的子孫都姓姬，「姬」字也從女旁，而且從不看見有男字旁的姓，甚至連男字旁的字也很少很少。按字形的分淅上研究，似乎可以證明女性應有在先的歷史。</p>
<h3>今年最時髦的頭髮</h3>
<p>美國好蘭塢的第一流電影女明星的頭髮，一九三三年新出四種式樣，這四種式樣，數日來非常時髦，一般交際社會的婦女們，都在摹倣着，現在我爲上海的愛摩登婦女們介紹一下，</p>
<p>第一種灰華歷得式　這種樣子M·＆M公司的憂琳但維絲新作的，把覆在耳朶部分的髪，卷得很奇　，兩面的尖端，成一大輪。這位小姐想出這種式樣之後，裝飾得非常好看，爲一般女子所贊成，聽說有一位善於獻媚的靑年，他竟用二萬元登了廣告，爲伊讚揚漂亮不已，因此引起了社會上的注意。</p>
<p>第二種布麗迷來式　這是瓊裘納德小姐所創始的，在頭頂的當中，分左右兩方梳開，以覆蓋兩耳爲限度，頭的後影，與頸稍短一些，好似鴨尾巴一樣。</p>
<p>第三種全富來英式這是范衣雷小姐的髪形，偏於右而分梳，頂上的髪，逐漸向下，燙成螺旋形，在額前好像有雲覆蓋的樣子，兩面耳旁的髪貼緊兩耳。</p>
<p>第四種蘇歸來式　這是裴克唁密爾登小姐初發明的，髪向後方梳，頭的兩側，燙成柔軟的指輪形，用花裝飾，但是在耳下面露出耳的三分之一。</p>
<h3>短衣人</h3>
<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>此爲新式短大衣之一，衣料以黑色棕色之素緞或素呢最宜；</p>
<p>綴以潔白長毛之圓領，尤覺美觀。束腰用淺色絲辮，結成雙錢或蝴蝶結，蓋覺新穎可喜。</p>
<p>如以白素緞綴黃狐皮圓領，雖亦鮮艷奪目，終不若黑色棕色之能耐久也。</p>

<h3>俄貨傾銷與經濟侵略</h3>
<p>— 威</p>
<p>蘇俄在第一屆五年計劃中，輸出料　煤油木材皮毛等，暢銷世界市場，他國同類貨品受其擠軋。蓋蘇俄銷貨，不計成本，與他國貨價以成本爲標準者　不相同；惟其不計成本，儘可跌價銷售，市價跌落，靡所底止，恐慌之勢莫由挽回。俄貨之傾銷國外，其用意在促成世界革命，非含有經濟侵略之作用而何。於是有爲之維護　曰：蘇俄實行五年計劃，竭力振興重工業，缺乏機器材料，不得不以有易　：以抑制消　之所餘，易取渴需之品，敬非忍痛削價，恐難如願以價。其設法傾銷也，實出於不得已，决無侵略意味存乎其關。且在社會主義之國，調劑生產與消費，務求二進之均衡；消費有餘，則即制生產，消費不足，則增加生產，生產專爲消費而設，决無遏制之慮，俄產旣非過剩，無庸以他國爲尾問。　謂經濟侵略，在蘇俄永無其事，固可斷言者也。曰：是大不然。今蘇俄當局之生產計劃，果僅以供國内消费爲自標乎？抑非以此为止境乎？彼當局賞實機將來生產，逐年增加，煤油產額，可超過美利堅；　　製造額，可軼出英德；共他農工產品之數量，都將駕先進國而上之，以復地人物博，寳藏也多，工作進行，機續不懈，使無他種障礙，其所預定者未必不能實現；設竟實現，則其時重工業之製品，及直接消費品，都已充牣有餘。將輪出其所餘易其所無乎？則其國内固百物皆備，無全易之必要，縱有須仰給於外者，衹極少數貨品耳。將任消費者予取予求，不加限制乎？則重工業製品，非供直接消費之用：直接消費品，需要自有定量，譬如每人所用皮鞋不妨備二三雙；每日所用麵包固無須十磅八磅也，將以其所餘吞存貯公庫，備意外之需要乎？不時之需，固不能斷其必無，然亦有一定限度，超過此限度，不管以有用之物，置諸無用之地，庫中積貨，任共腐朽，豈不可惜。將減少工作，或竟移其工力改任實業以外之職務乎？實業以外之職務，節圖　狹，果有悉數容納之餘地乎？故爲利用人多欺人之技能計；爲銷納遏勝之產品計；爲預防庫儲腐朽計；殆非以其所餘者悉數運銷境外，不能解决此難題矣。果若是，蘇聯今後對外貿易，與彼資本主義之國務求輸出超遏者，有以異乎？無以異乎？居今之世，國家畛域尙未化除，民族界限業未打破，不論其國施行何種經濟制度，要無不以自國利益爲本位。安有日夕孜孜殖產興業，以超遏他國生產爲目標，不謀據張經濟勢力於國個者乎？且蘇聯之農工事業，力求機械化，號稱劃除資本主義，而對於資本主義之生產方法，竭力摹仿，惟恐不肖。所不同者，在他國爲私人資本主義，在蘇聯則爲國家資本主義耳。說者謂：「帝國主義由資本主義孕育而來；」使斯言而合理也，則不問資本主義屬於何種，其能孕育帝國主義而已矣。</p>
<h3>統制經濟與計劃經濟</h3>
<p>— 王雨桐</p>
<p>自一九二九年十月，因美國華爾街發生劇變，遂令世界之經濟狀況，突轉惡劣，而隨於空前未有之大恐慌。以其影響之深刻，顯至生產過剩，利潤低下，失業增加，民生窘迫，此固者當時一般力唱產　合理化者之始料所及也。時迄今日，經濟恐慌之餘波，猶見汎瀾，舉世之經濟狀態，終於安定之望，於是一般經濟學者，咸嚴咎於過去資本主義之經濟組織，過重自由，不加拘束，至製成今日經濟界東西奔突，躥越範圖之結果。於是乃有所謂「統制經濟」，及「計劃經濟」之政策，爲現時經濟界，衆口同聲所認爲補救經濟恐慌之惟一良劑者也。</p>
<p>夫所謂統制經濟與計劃經濟，此兩者之意義，有時實爲相同，其目的無非欲謀展拓目前資本主義經濟組織之阻塞途徑；兩者之共同主點，乃爲限制現時自由競爭之經濟組織，加抑壓於其活動力，使各國之利益，均歸是於主體之利益。惟吾人體察一般學者間，對於統制經濟與計劃經濟，其立義似有差異。卽前者不過爲擬　國家之規制，以救濟經濟界恐慌現狀之方法，且從事抑制現有一部份資本之威力及活動力，俾圖經濟界全體之發展而已。至計劃經濟，則爲對於現時之資本主義自由經濟組織，視爲根本錯誤，切實否認之，同時於經濟界，另行作有計劃之新組織，而至活動。換言之，統制經濟，爲矯正經濟界現狀之方法，計劃經濟，　捨棄現時之經濟組織，重事組織不同式之經濟界也。</p>
<p>吾人茍欲求統制經濟之統制意義，可以去歲日本商　省關於產業統制之解釋爲例，其文曰：「關於重　產業統制之法律，其使命所在，蓋鑒於日本產業界之現狀，擬予以適當之規律統制，以除絕其不安定之根源，改善各種產業，置於安固基礎之上，俾謀國民經濟之繁榮；一方爲統制重　產業起見，務使各項產業，受轄於統制協定之下，凡有棄亂統制者，則不問其已否加入協定，皆應令其遵行統制。且一方政府於統制協定，爲擁護公益起見，實施監督，遏協定之違反公益，或認爲有害其他產業之公正利益時，卽令其取消或變更，」又關於計劃經濟之解釋，最近日本經濟學者山口正太郎於「計劃經濟之原理」一文中；稱「所謂計劃經濟者，乃於已實行之事業外，更於較深之處，從事計劃的統制，此非就經濟生活之全面的努力不可，茍衹關於一部份之生產業統制，則不足謂爲計劃經濟。」吾人觀於上述之兩種明晰解釋，則對於統制經濟與計劃經濟之區分，當可獲更進之認識矣。</p>
<h3>讀糧食管理政策草案</h3>
<p>— 法</p>
<p>近年來因公糧恐慌之　大，研究及討論食糧問題者亦多矣，而於吾國食糧問題之實質，能看中切要，分析清楚者，實不多見。内政部糧食管理政策草案，已於前日在報端披露，雖公布實行，尙待時日，亦末始非多年來糧食問題討論之結晶。粽觀該草案，一般言之，允稱精密週詳，一反以前政府漠視糧食問題之態度，尤可慶幸。</p>
<p>該法草案，尙待修改，未爲定案，　無用逐條評論，雖愚者一得，記者自以爲關於糧食問題，有數根不要點，足資當局參考者，爰誌於此。</p>
<p>大概吾國今日之糧食問題，複雜異常，關涉頗大，卽就草案中所言，亦云：「抑考糧食管理，不僅爲一經濟政策，且爲一國防政策，凡所設施，均應與軍事·土地·水利·交通·衛生·財務等政策聯系進行，實一包羅萬象之事　也。」要之其成因，語其　者，可分爲生產及貿易二方面言之。</p>
<p>在生產方面言，則造成今日食糧恐慌者，有數因素：第一，各地軍警，爲財政收人計，强迫及獎掖農民種植鴉片，實乃糧食收種之致命打擊。第二，自資本主義侵入後，資本主義國家爲侵奪工業原料，吾國種植農產，變迫頗大。如各處本種米麥者，常多改種棉菸藥等原料，以增加收入，對於食糧生產之减少，影響殊大。第三，土地日益細分，零碎地耕種日多，加以租佃制度普遍，均爲减少食粮生产之要素。第四，小農日困，生產工具日劣，對於食糧生產之减少，亦有莫大之關係。</p>
<p>然糧食問題尙非如此之單純，生產之外，貿易關係亦多。如草案中亦已言及：「省自爲政，各不相謀」。乃其造因之一。貿易方面，主要者如；第一，小農經濟拮据，所有農本不得不向糧行或地主富商借貸，以致糧價常爲操縱，生產者反無以爲食。第二，糧食屯積，居命待價，常可促起食糧恐慌。第三，交通阻礙，禁米出外，在在均足影響食糧流通。第四，最重要者，爲洋米傾銷，常使本米腐爛，奸商勾結洋商，運米出洋，以資壟斷。凡此皆爲糧食問題之主要造因，而各地方當局之增加賦稅，橫求苛徴，猶不與也。</p>
<p>糧食管理法如能早日實行，且行而適宜，則對於糧食問題之解决，造福平民，是非淺鮮。如僅及外形，對於谷募之病根，無能爲力，則不僅爲一紙具文，且亦足　詐病。是有望於　法諸公焉。</p>
<h3>我國對外貿易之危機</h3>
<p>— 達仲</p>
<p>近年來，國民經濟，衰敗已達極點，而其中之最顯著者，英過於國外貿易之低落。當民國二十一年開始時，承前年大水之後，復權以一二八滬戰，本年貿易之衰微，有識者固早已慮及。現二十一年業已告終，貿易　字，亦經海關發表，其結果如何，吾人不能不抱無窮之悲觀也。</p>
<p>據海關月報所載及國際貿易局發表統計，上年全年貿易，出口凈數，爲四萬九午二百六十萬關兩，人口凈數，值十萬零四千九百萬關兩，總計爲十五萬四千一百八十餘關兩。致前年之二十三萬萬關兩，减落五分之二，僅及前年百分之六十六。此種貿易之衰落，已爲近十年來之最低數，而其中之最令人注意者，則莫過於出口之慘落。此四萬九千二百萬關兩之數字，爲歐戰以後十五年來所僅見，與最髙之十八年，相差一倍以上，卽與前年相較，亦僅等於百分之五十四。其减落之情形及其速度，實　可驚。若就出人口成分言之，則上年貿易總值十五分萬萬關兩中，人口所占者，爲百分之六十八，出口所占者。僅百分之三十二，卽入口占三分之二强，出口僅占三分之一不足，此吾人所應極端注意者也。</p>
<p>出口貿易之極度减低，其結果遂釀成前所未有之巨額大超。全年合計，人超五萬五千六百萬關兩，較前年尙髙出三千二百萬關兩，與民元比，超過五倍，與歐戰期中入超最低時比較，超過三十四倍，爲數之巨，可想而知。而此五萬五千六百萬入超，且超過本年之出口總值　此種情形，不僅爲　國歷史上所無，抑亦各國所未有也。</p>
<p>人超原爲國際貿易中之逆象，在素無無形收入以資彌補之我國，其逆像萬屬顯著。上年出口之减低，及入超之增長，七月以後，東北海關被叛逆刦奪，數字不全，當爲其一重要原因。然吾人須知上年前半期東北各關貿易，爲數已低，卽令下半期同等貿易，數字完全，全年貿易，出口亦不過等於前年百分之六十八，人口不遏等於前年百分之七十八，相差仍巨。</p>
<p>是則上年貿易之慘落，實際上本身不振，固無庸爲　者也。</p>
<p>近年以來，出口貿易，逐年衰落，如絲茶國產品等項，無不較以前爲低。具統計數字觀察，尤足令人危懼，有識者固早已大聲疾呼，極力促進，然而提倡自提倡　其結果且達上年之空前慘落。結　所在，國内產業之不振，實居最大原因。在世界經濟恐慌期中，各國無不增髙關稅壁壘，限制入口貿易，對於國外商品，均以節約及自給爲原則，對於吾國輸出商品，當有重大影響。然茍能提髙品質，改良出產，適合市場需要，以吾國出口商品在國際市場性質之優異，維持舊有市場，以與各國相角逐，亦未始無望。　　上年出口貿易之慘落，其情形固極明顯，而重要出口商品之日趨衰敗，其趨勢尤爲顯著。吾國貿易之危機，此業已充分表現。茍不速起圖謀，設法挽救，前途不堪設想，恐數年以後，國際市場，無復我國商品之立足地。其情形之重要，國人　勿忽視也。</p>
<h3>論提倡高穀價的利害</h3>
<p>— 超構</p>
<p>「穀賤傷農」，這是已成的事，但穀貴能否救農？亦不容易斷定。僅以提髙穀價的方法，就可以救濟農村，恢復購買力。這問題很堪研究！</p>
<p>我們知道，最需要救濟的並不是一般的農家，主要的是農民中的佃農和貧農。這層的農民，受年來的天災人禍壓迫，處在最悲慘的狀態之中，縱使我們的穀米政策不能以貧農爲整個對象，但貧農總不失爲主要的對象，至少我們須得顧慮他們的利害，因爲貧農究竟佔農民的絕對多數。</p>
<p>我們且問：提高谷價，對於這層最苦的貧農佃農，有無好處？這層貧農，每到收　，須以大部份穀物，作爲租穀金給地主，所留下來的餘額是他們全家每年所需的最低生活品，在理論上是不能出售的。所以，實際上和穀價發生關係的是屬於地主富農手中的穀物，地主富農在低價之下，願意把穀物喂飼牲畜，今年的恐慌，實際上是地主富農及米商的恐慌。</p>
<p>去年的恐慌更加利害，是農村的貧乏，資金的向城市集中，農民資金週轉闲難，農民爲購入日常必需商品，肥料，農器，不得不受高利的借款，而以收成作償。卽不然，農民也須變賣其收成，以供今年的消費。這栗一來，維持農民生活的部分穀糧，不得不以低價集中地主米商之手，他們被迫於　火的家計；不得已取這可憐的辦法，正所謂「醫得眼前瘡，剜却心頭肉」。這種情形，在前年的災區中尤爲普遍，他們於前年借人資金，把去年的穀作抵，在靑黃未接之時，這些收成已屬於地主和米商了，他們到現在是一無所有，縱使穀價提高，他們有什麼好處。</p>
<p>所以，要救農，應該在新穀登場以先一二月，到後來提高穀價，得實惠的是地主和囤存糧米的投機商人。</p>
<p>不但如此，我們若從另外個觀點看來，提高穀價不僅無益，反而有害。　　何故，據上所說，窮乏的結果，使大部的農價出賣其生活所必需的穀糧，他們以最低價出賣生產物，同時自己作爲消費者，購入穀米，他們的利害，並不和地主富農一致，反和城市的消費者一致，他們旣以低價出賣其生產品，則當然　　以廉價購入消費品。穀價變高，他們旣受不到利益，反受到高價消費的苦痛，等於變重壓迫。</p>
<p>穀米的消費者中，包含小工商階級，店夥工人以及俸給生活者，他們並沒有較　的生活，米價抬高，對他們生活是重大的威脅。有人以爲穀價增設的結果，能使工賃提高，殊不知無論如何，工賃的上漲，總較物價上漲來得遲緩些，况在這樣情形之下，產　絕少振興之望，苟能維持下去，已屬萬幸，否則勞資糾紛一起，失業加多，社會反爲不安，這並不是我故作危言聳聽，實在是必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>卽使在理論上有提高穀價之必要，仍有許多困難、洋米傾銷　確是穀價下跌的大原因，但可憐的是中國有些地方已和洋米不能分離，一旦禁止洋米進口，投機商人囤積的結果，在消費地帶米價當然飛漲。然產米區，能否供應無缺，卽使運輸便利，捐照取銷，六商的生意順利，地主的米穀以好價也賣了，然而產米區裏的消費者和貧農苦了，這可算得公平嗎？</p>
<p>有人主張公倉和抵押，但能得用公倉或抵押的也不過是米商地主之流，貧農是無法利用的，因爲農民卽有餘穀，也不能負扣利息，若照時價折扣抵押，反不若出賣可得多額資金，而且一切的利息費用，將來必然的轉嫁給消費者身上，其結果消費者愈苦，地主米商得利，依然是病民的辦法。所以提高穀價，結果是農民愈苦，城市消費者生活惡劣，產業因爲農村都市的購買力减遏同時成本增高，前途更無辦法。</p>
<p>關於怎樣救農，這是複難問題，有機會當再討論。</p>
<h3>芝加哥博覽會徴品展覽開幕</h3>
<p>— 何冰</p>
<p>喧傳日久之芝加哥博覽會徴品展覽會，已於前日（十八日）在法租界中央研究會開幕；在此經濟凋敝，困難秘亟之際，吾人思前顧後，未能無感焉：</p>
<p>考吾國之參加國際博覽會，由來亦有多次。大戰以前吾國參加之國際博覽會，咸由海關洋員包辦，結果反見侮辱國體，姑不具論。主　者如一九一五年之參加巴拿馬太平洋萬國博覽會，及菲律賓嘉年華會賽會，一九二六年之參加費城博覽會，一九二九年之參加菲律賓遼東商品展覽會，莫不規劃萬方，耗資巨萬。所希冀者，無非思藉此機會，廣爲宣傳，俾振興吾國商品之對外貿易。惟振興貿易，要素頗多，非宣傳一事，能收全效，是故吾國貿易外受國際商品傾銷之打擊，內爲戰爭及重稅所阻撓，僅有江河日下，趨於衰頹之一途。</p>
<p>此次芝加哥百年進步博覽會，其性質且有與前不同者。卽該會宣言所言：「此次博覽會，注重科學進步，自不待言」又云：「本會之目的，在注重整個各　之進步全場佔地約八百英畝，在密斯格湖畔矗立無數之近代建築物，卽就表面觀之亦呈表示此次博覽會與歷來博覽不同之精神。」蓋芝加哥爲美國主要大都市之一，該會目的卽在於表揚百年來芝加哥建設與夫美國各種科學之進步也。</p>
<p>近百年來，可謂吾國數千年來歷史之新階段，亦卽吾國有史以來之不幸時期也。中英鴉片戰後，門戶洞開，經濟命脈，俱操諸帝國主義者之手。頻年戰爭，不斷災荒，民益困，國日弱，均與帝國主義之侵略，擊有密切關係。百年進步，因無由也，有之，無非欺人自欺者流，炫於近海少數　市之畸形發展，而以爲此乃進步之表現。殊不知今日中國沿海都市之發展，乃基於全國普通農村枯竭之上，亦卽帝國主義侵略之功也。其次，雖有一部份人，尙能鑒及近年來吾國百業之衰落，然亦少有作根本救濟之想者，而僅追慕往昔之盛况而已。</p>
<p>是以此次廣徴展覽之商品，仍與以前各次無異，主要者無非絲，茶，湘橚瓷器等物，語其已往，固有光榮之歷史；而其所百年之狀况，實屬衰落無已。是豈彼此相映，以示他人之長耶？度主持者之甘心孤詣，吾知其對於吾國貿易之前途，屬望殊殷也。</p>
<p>考夫吾國經濟之實况，各地人民之日用，製造品多取給於人，是知開始國内市場之需要，實不下於國外市場，而國外貿易之增進，更有待於國内工業之改進。開始國內市場及發展工業之道云何？曰澄清政治，曰載戢干戈，曰肅清盜匪，曰豁治苛稅，曰保障國貨抵禦侵略數端云耳，不如此，舍本逐末，何濟於事，雖非自爲角潮，亦無非爲人作嫁而已。</p>
<p>征品展覽會，於十八日開幕矣。吾人綜覧全場，於欽佩主持者之熱心將事外，能無感乎？如因此次博覽會之舉行，吾人相與觀摩，怵然於心，因而百尺竿頭，更進一步，而爲治本之努力，則此次展覧，有足多者，將來吾國實業之改進，亦利顯之矣。</p>
<h3>農銀放款期限的商榷</h3>
<p>農民依靠的放款底期限，無論怎樣，總是比商業放款來得長，這是因爲二者性質不同的緣故。商業放款衹爲營業上周轉，而農業放款，大都用諸農作方面，無商業周轉之便，時間非較長不可。但是農民銀行的放款期限。究應以何爲標準呢？爽直的說，自應依借款的用途而定。但在目下中國所有的農民銀行，關於放款的期限，大部分最長不得過二年，當然這個期限是非常呆板而侷促的，照我看來，農民貸款的期限，不妨分爲左列一種：</p>
<p>定期一年的放款　備農民借資購置肥料種子之用。</p>
<p>定期三年的放款　備農民借資購買農具耕牛之用。</p>
<p>定期五年的放款　備農民借資以作開墾之用。</p>
<p>其實，放款期限的長短，還要視政府的政策而轉移。假如政府注重增加農民的生產力，那末期限的長短可不一定。倘爲解除農民「熟荒」之痛苦，就是生產雖豐，價格人跌，要營農產抵押放款，以資救濟，這種期限，卽在一年以內，亦無不可。總之要看政府的政策而定方針。</p>
<p>平均地權保耕者有其田，爲國民黨政綱之一。可是現在佃戶的耕種權，完全採在地主手裏。佃戶今年租種這方田，到了明年，是否仍是他耕種，他自己也不能知道。問之他對於這方面，衹願目的的收入，不肯想法去改變，致與生產方面人受影響。而欲解决此問題，又非耕者有其出不可。如果耕者有其田，周轉　土地銀行分配的手段，當然是不對。那末，又　農民銀行來完成這使命的了。就是由農民銀行借貸給佃戶，呌他買田，這田就　給農民銀行作爲抵押品，期限可定爲十年或十年以上，還款則用分期拔付的方法，　知一畝田，值洋六十元，以後佃戶設分十年攢還，那麼每年衹須本息七八元，與還租也差不多，十年之後，這畝田便算是他的了。這種方法，於　方都有利，在農民銀行方面，因爲這畝田是抵在他那邊的，而田價又是　繼漲高的（？）放款可以放心。在買田的一方面，因分期拔還法還欵，並沒有什麼困難，也沒有什麼額外的負挸，而田已爲他所有的了。（本辦法是參照美國BuildiogandＬoanAsociarico)不過這種放欵，目前尙有困難。若是實行以後，需要一定　當之多，期限又是很長，農民銀行資本有限，發行債券，則社會上還沒有信任，所以衹能作爲一種商榷，如何實行，還在其後呢！</p>

<h3>中國人的手和脚</h3>
<p>— 高明</p>
<p>前讀日本某雜誌·見到一篇東西記一個法國學者關於中國人的手的研究。據說，那法國學者就世界各國人的手加以研究，結果發見中國人的手的指端最富於黏力，這也就是說，同樣摸一個錢，手上黏到錢垢最多的便是中國人。在這段記載後面，還附着日本人對這件事的解釋，大意說：中國人手裏不能經過錢，一有錢經過他們的手便要被他們中飽，大概就是這個緣故了。</p>
<p>對於中國人愛錢這件事都注意着生物學的說明，這一點，我們的確不能不五體股投地的佩服日本人的偉大。</p>
<p>中國人的手旣有這樣的特徴，那末他們的脚又是怎樣呢？關於中國人的脚，我敢和你們打賭，不久一定會有人在同樣加以精細研究之後發見其有滑性的。中國人普通把西洋人喚做「直脚鬼」，無形之中当然也就在誇耀着自己有一雙靈活的脚；這却不談。而事實告訴我們的也是：中国人的脚是最最敏捷的。馬路上本來閧着一羣人，但是一聽說外國三道頭来了，即刻會以绝大的速率逃散。一點也不誇張，其迅速是可驚的。這一次日本人打下了山海關，消息一傳到平津，南下的列車即刻爲逃難者擠滿了。到後来聽說非於一星期前預定，不能購得車票。真是熱鬧極了。這個，當然也不過是中國人兩脚靈活的一個小小的例證而已。</p>
<p>動物學書上記駝鳥的事，是很滑稽的。據說駝鳥善走，爲人追捕時，常逃到一個地方將腦袋掩藏起來，以爲就此安全了。當然我在這裏這樣談起，並不是說中國人就像駝鳥。因爲中國人是素來以獅自喩的。</p>
<h3>飛機救國的言論之類</h3>
<p>— 李丹山</p>
<p>飛機飛機，我們在嘗彀了這東西的威力之後，居然有了飛機救國的種種表現，雖然現在的辦法和未來的成績，是否能從效率上享受美而又滿的結果，尙未知，可可是這究竟是一件教那些拿大薪水或者度寓公生活的舒服人們所應當望而生愧的事。不過這種表現已經有愈來愈普遍的趨勢，宣傳喊吶頗不乏人，因而或許就有近乎「客氣」的議論丨丨照流行的口吻說來，就是所謂近乎「感情用事」。然而，這種表現的本身何嘗是壞事呢！所以我們能彀把這裏面的「客氣」導爲「正氣」導爲「浩然之氣」則可，凝爲「冷氣」則不可，積極地獻以忠告則可，消極地加以冷嘲則不可。</p>
<p>一月十一日的華年週刊的長短評，有一則是名爲「航空救國聲中的一點常識」的，其中首段引起「東北數百架飛機那裏去了」的話，意思就是：「沒有志願和能力是罔然的」。固然這個罔然是不錯不錯真不錯的，不過我想起若是有了志願和能力，而又沒有飛機的時候，那末又怎樣辦？當然可見得精神丨丨志願及人才丨丨和物質丨丨飛機及燃料丨丨是應當並重的。所以華年的編輯者的語言，爲去年東北的空軍而發則是對的，爲這時正在醞釀之中的空軍而發，則是有語病的，尤其是冠在唐有壬君的那段談語之前。</p>
<p>唐君的大意：㈠全國每縣各購一飛機，其漏巵之數可以亡國。且無機師則機雖多而仍無用。㈡科學日新月異，我若無整個計畫，推陳出新，則二三年後所有飛機皆成廢物。㈢日本飛機之能操勝算，還是靠海陸軍充實，否則飛機終於飛不起。</p>
<p>照㈠的意思是：就財政的現狀而論，飛機不必買。㈡是：就科學的進步而論，飛機也不必買。㈢是：就海陸軍的實力而論，飛機還是不必買。結果，他的意思是明顯得不能再明顯了，就是：要有整個計劃，要有科學的基礎，要有海陸軍的輔助；然而以唐君的地位而僅僅衹有這種空言，未免是教人懷疑的。</p>
<p>因爲唐君是一個政治上較的力量的人，旣然對於飛機救國有了很理智的丨丨反對感情作用的丨丨見角，何以不用登高一呼的方法，去計劃一個把海軍陸軍科學財政諸點合一爐而冶之的整個計劃，使得這個由民間發起的飛機救國的表現，得個積極的贊助，而衹向訪問的記者，發出這樣有理論無辦法的空言，教人認爲是消極的指摘呢？並且，一切陸軍用的器械，難道不是漏巵，難道不倚賴科學推陳出新，難道不靠別種軍的充實，何以唐君並不因之而有所論列呢？難道因爲飛機救國是民間發起而陸軍的種種是國主辦呢？說到這里，我想唐君也難於自解。</p>
<p>然而唐君的動機，想來仍或不失爲「君子之過」罷，不過飛機救國這種表現是不可有所謂「殺風景」之類的事，所以我希望論者不要以「理智」或者「常識」的道兒，陷入患得患失和自私自利的冷酷的窠臼裏，使那些望而生愧的人有所藉口而累及飛機的本身！</p>

<h3>黑女求神記（五）</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作宜閑譯</p>
<p>「我的心願蕩得遠啦，」黑女孩子說。「閉起眼睛來是不對的。對於神的知識，我想望得比幸福或希望更切。神是我的幸福和我的希望。」</p>
<p>「如果你發覺到神是沒有的，那麼怎麼着呢？」那少年說。</p>
<p>「如果我沒有知道神存在着，那我要做壞女人了，」黑女孩子說。</p>
<p>「這誰告訴你？」那少年說。「你不該讓人們用了這等制限將你的心綑起來。况且，你怎麼不該做一個壞女人呢？」</p>
<p>「胡說！」黑女孩子說。「做壞女人就是做你不應做的事。」</p>
<p>「那麼，你得弄明白你應做的事，綫能夠明白你是好女人還是壞女人。」</p>
<p>「这是對的，」黑女孩子說。「然而我却知道：卽使做好人是壞事，我也應當做一個好女人。」</p>
<p>「這句话是沒有意識的，」那少年說。</p>
<p>「沒有你的一種意識，却有神的一種意识」她说。「我要有這一種意識；我覺得我得到了這，我能夠見麼神了。」</p>
<p>「你那裏知道你可以見的什麼呢？」他說。「我對你的勸告是：趁你能做的時候，儘你的能力來做一切臨到你的工作，以效用和榮譽來填滿那在無可避免的盡頭以前留給你的時日，一到那盡頭，就不會有勸告或工作，知或行，甚至也不會有存在了。」</p>
<p>「我死了，會有未來的，」黑女孩子說。「如果我不能生活於未來，我總能知道牠。」</p>
<p>「你知道過去麼？」那少年說。「如果實在發生過的過去，你沒有知道，那你怎能希望知道還未發生的未來呢？」</p>
<p>「可是這會發生的；這我很知道，我簡直可以告訴你：太陽天天會升起來的。」黑女孩子說　　「這也是空幻，」那年靑的哲人說。「太陽正在燒着，總有一天要本身燒盡。」</p>
<p>「生是儘在燒毀本身的火焰；然而每逢一個孩子出生的時候，生却又引着火了。生是比死偉大，希望是比絕望偉大。我肯做臨到我的工作的，只要我知道這是好工作；要知道這一點，我必須知道過去和未來。必須知道神。」</p>
<p>「你的意思是你必須做。神」他說，一面嚴緊地看她。</p>
<p>「儘我的能力就是了，」黑女孩子說。「多謝你。年靑的我們真是聰明的分子：知道神就是</p>
<p>做神，這一層我從你這裏已經領教了。你使我的靈魂已經加强了。趁我離開你以前，請告訴我罷：你是誰？」</p>
<p>「我是柯赫來司；許多人所知道的傳道書的傳道者，」他回答。「如果你找得到神，神就和你同在！他沒有和我同在。學習希臘文罷：這是智慧的語言啦。再見」</p>
<p>他做了一個友誼的手勢，便過去了。黑女孩子走着對向的路，心裏想的愈加厲害了：然而他所挑發的她內中的思緒却變得很迷惑很艱難，終於她睡熟了。她在睡中穩步走去，直至她嗅到了一隻獅子，這縐　忽然醒來，見他正坐在她的路途的當中，好像爐邊的貓似的曝着太陽；這是呌做無鬉種的這一種獅子，所以呌作無鬉種者，因爲牠的鬉毛秀美而整齊，不像蓬鬆的拖箒的緣故。</p>
<p>「哦哦！畜生，」她在經過他身邊的時候，用她的指頭在他𩓐子上撫摩似的略略撮了一下，那指頭感得彷彿撮着山上和暖的一叢靑苔似的。</p>
<p>（注）狄克是對於驢子的一種暱稱。</p>
<h3>長期抵抗</h3>
<p>— 老舍</p>
<p>好小子，你敢打？</p>
<p>我立刻通電罵你祖宗！</p>
<p>並且高喊，長期抵抗！</p>
<p>一定；你的耳朶當然不聾？</p>
<p>你在這邊打，打吧；</p>
<p>我上那邊去出恭。</p>
<p>敢過來不敢，小子？</p>
<p>敢！好，你小子是發了瘋。</p>
<p>你真過來？咱們明天再見，</p>
<p>和瘋狗打架算不了英雄。</p>
<p>我今天不打你，明天不打你，</p>
<p>後天，嘔，後天是年節我歇工。</p>
<p>這麼辦吧，過了新年再說，</p>
<p>你不前進，我犯不上改守爲攻；</p>
<p>你若前進，自討沒臉，</p>
<p>我决定長期抵抗，一輩子不和你交鋒。</p>
<p>啊，長期抵抗，長期抵抗，</p>
<p>難道你聽着就無動於中？</p>
<p>一年，二年，你有多少炮彈，</p>
<p>敢老拍拉拍拉向我轟？</p>
<p>假如你自己震破了手，</p>
<p>難道你媽媽就不心疼？</p>
<p>你看我，身體發膚受之父母，</p>
<p>講究未曾開炮先去鞠躬。</p>
<p>小子，你也學着點禮貌，</p>
<p>好好的隣居何必水火不相容？</p>
<p>况且爲何不向老美老俄先瞪瞪眼，</p>
<p>他們和你正是對手相逢。</p>
<p>沒事偏來找尋我，我又不是</p>
<p>鐵做的腦袋，穿不了大窟窿。</p>
<p>再不然，你不是炮彈太多無處用嗎？</p>
<p>何不去打火山，也省得地震咕鼕鼕。</p>
<p>勸你不聽，我也無法，只好</p>
<p>長期抵抗，一直退到雲南或廣東。</p>
<p>到了廣東，你還能再打，你還敢</p>
<p>炮轟香港惹翻你的老同盟？</p>
<p>凡事該得就得別過火，</p>
<p>善惡有報不要逞能！</p>
<p>長期抵抗，慷慨激昂！</p>
<p>聽見沒有？來，放下槍炮咱們先喝一盅。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>歡送蕭伯訥</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>實事是如此，爲了蕭伯訥的駕臨上海，我們的報章雜誌都熱鬧了好幾天。大家歡迎。至於歡迎的理由多得很，因爲他是得了諾貝爾文學獎金的戲劇家，因爲他是自命社會主義的理論家，最主要的因爲他還是咬文嚼字的幽默家，無疑義，幽默者，在現在的中國最爲風行</p>
<p>然而，寡陋如小子者，一時找不着歡迎的理由，不敢凑湊热闹，但是现在他是離開了「甚爲惡劣的上海」而坐在海上皇宫裏去聽悠美的砲聲。於是在大家歡呼熱鬧之餘，我也就來歡送一下罷。</p>
<p>關於蕭先生以前的言論著作，許多熱心者當然可從極盡介紹能事的專刊上得着充分的學識，用不着再來嚕囌，所以只關於他在香港和在上海的談話，略略的理解理解。</p>
<p>蕭先生的學問，是淵博的吧，蕭先生的人格，是偉大的吧，而且大膽的教咱們中國靑年從事「赤色革命」，這種「不適合中國國情」言論，只有他老先生才敢輕口道出。這大概因爲他是大英帝國的臣民而不是中國的老百姓的原故吧。不過這也是他的經驗之談，所以他現在已是七十七歲的老翁，還不曾成爲「殭石」，還不曾「落伍」。所以他老先生確是被一般人所稱道的那樣高深，那樣偉大。不過也居然有人批評他說：「只要在社會裏混出頭，衹求不殭，衹求不落伍，」於是。「主義本身的價值如何，本來與個人的前途沒有多大關係」，於此可知，說話真是不易，然而蕭先生究竟不是過激革命者，就如前天再三聲明，並不「勸令學生至街上毆打警察，」而且「反對罷工」，因爲罷工，「其結果亦必凍餓，」善哉斯言丨所以我們很可以大膽放心，蕭先生决不是「赤色革命」的宣傳者，更不是有意到咱們中國來鼓吹革命，不過是爲了旣已受人歡迎而不得不略事談談而已。</p>
<p>至於他之揄揚蘇聯，那也只是他個人的意見，並不必要中國一定也要「借鏡」。然而他答俄報記者的「假如今日君返國之後而仍能逃走者，」却是冷語可怕。再如他說「李頓報告書可稱公平，」更是名言，不過我們的學者們已經不壓其「篇幅過長」，而竟「全部」「熟讀」，於是亦認爲「可稱公平」了。</p>
<p>現在這位老先生已因爲「上海至爲惡劣」而怱怱他往，或許是要到秦皇島去「恭迎第二次世界大戰」之到臨，其行色促促，不免令歡迎者爲之掃興，然而他所給與我們的教訓，到是值得我們後生小子「寤寐思之」的。去矣丨蕭翁，讓他去罷，他已是這樣的老了，對於未來的中國，當然無能爲力。謹以至誠，敬獻歡送之意。</p>

<h3>爲「一個問題黃包車夫的兒子」而作</h3>
<p>— 毓</p>
<p>黃包車夫的兒子「讀書」在黃包車夫的希望之迷中，他有黃包車被人拉的一天。當然，拉黃包車和黃包車被拉，是十塊錢和三十九萬同樣的懸殊。</p>
<p>說起「讀書」，就有一句「十年窗下」從喉嚨口衝出來。山東人希望「真命天子」出世的理由就在這裡。皇帝伯伯的三十九萬頭獎，高高懸起，「十年窗下」的苦功，正是打發財票的本錢。雖然「狀元」衹有三年一個，然而「探花」「榜眼」，甚而至於「進士」「舉人」，再退一萬步而變做三家村里的窮「秀才」，也能握着水烟袋哼三聲「學而時習之」以冷板凳自給。</p>
<p>黃包車夫的兒子僅讀到「初中」畢業，離「高中」「大學」「鍍金」，不知幾百萬裡；猶如想發財的朋友沒有本錢，把兩頓飯的兩毛錢省下來，和人家合買。說他中了，却像「初中」畢業後就不肯「屈居」自家的「貴攤頭」一樣的搭不起臭「架子」。不中，却人財兩空（兒子和衣服丨見黃包車夫的兒子）一樣的餓着肚皮緊袴子帶。</p>
<p>再說「吃一行怨一行」，黃包車夫在日曬，風吹，雨打，雪飛中掙扎。衹怪自己不聰明」，不能「拉包車」「開汽車」······。兒子「天資聰慧」，黃包車夫也難得「聰明」起來，以爲「老天不負苦心人」，從他兒子身上着實可以「翻本」。不料旣不「榮宗耀祖」，也不「升官發財」。連「成家立業」「娶妻生子」也給你個「長期抵抗」。不知黃包車的腦袋里有否「十年窗下」怪難記憶的字句。</p>
<p>然而（不是乖乖不得了）還有一句呌「行行出狀元」。不論你是否「天資聰慧」：或者「十年窗下」。「狀元」在你希望之迷中總佔據着一個位子。丨這就是像打發財票有三十九萬的希望一樣。拉黃包車的朋友們，「前車可鑒」，還是研究你們的「拉車藝術」，循循善誘，不難使你們的兒子成「拉車博士」。</p>
<p>記者「行行出狀元」。我不好意思再說一句像打發財票有三十九萬的希望一樣。</p>

<h3>離婚女子的出路</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>鄙人有生以來，二十四年；因爲從未跌入愛河情網。所以也就毫無煩悶。不幸（？）於去秋在友人家裏，無意中認識了一位少女：她是個已婚而又離婚的可憐女子。她以前的婚姻，無疑地是出於家長的專主。因爲不堪虐待，在結婚才三個月後，就提出離婚。此後她就與年老的寡母，相依爲命：靠着她們二十個手指，來維持生活：處境的困苦，不言可知了。不過她尙能澹泊自甘，所以這三年來，從不曾有過「怕尿臭」的事情：博得許多人的憐恤和同情。我自與她相識後　腦海裏就起了一種極深的印象：她的「耐苦」·「和藹」·「幹練」·尤其是她的身世，在在都可以引起我愛她的情緒。同時因爲她的「性格」·「舉止」很和我相像，所以她也時常有愛我的表示。直至現在，我倆已由單純的友誼，進而發生神密的「愛」的連擊了。接着我們就很自然地感到有結婚的必要了。</p>
<p>但是傳統思想的遺毒，成了我倆結婚前途的障礙。我的家長極端的反對我進行這件事；他們說「若與二婚（即嫁過的）的女子結婚，男方必　不利」；至於爲甚麼一定不利於男子的理由，他們却始終說不出來。這種迂腐的觀念，原是不值一笑；但偏偏這是我父母的意思·那就使我感到非常的困難和痛苦了丨若說順從了父母的意見，照我看來，因爲我是一個並無多金的商人，以後也就難望再找到這樣一個稱心滿意的配偶。反之，我父母的性情，又十分固執，難望得到他們的諒解。愛河情網裏的况味，難道就不能不帶些「辛酸」的成份嗎？編者先生：你的「智慧」，你的主張，素來我是佩服的；請你替我設身處地的下一個决心罷。（下略）孫綺回謹上。</p>
<p>編者按：年來中國人民，覺悟貌合神離的配偶，非但不合人道，而且男女雙方，都是有害無益；所以漸漸地贊成離婚了。同時「民法」規定離婚的條件，也不如從前那麼嚴厲；要是出於雙方同意的話，就可很自由地離異。因此離婚的案件，一天多似一天了。這不能不算一件很好的現象。可是一般人的思想，還不能澈底。有的像孫君的家長一樣，被傳統的，迷信的觀念支配，對於一個離婚後的女子，沒有勇氣去娶他。有的被貞操觀念所迷惑，對於一個離婚後的女子，因爲她不是個處女，就不屑去娶她。因此離婚後女子的出路，就毫無辦法；結果難逃下面的兩種弊病。㈠女子因爲鑒于離婚後，不能找到出路：就是有極充分理由，需要離婚，也就衹得逆來順受。㈡女子在離婚後，因爲不能找到出路，所以在離婚時，不能不要求巨額的贍養費；因此有許多男子，雖有不得不離婚的隱痛，爲了無力擔任這種贍養費，也就不敢提出了。我們旣已覺悟貌合神離的配偶，無維持的必要，同時贊成他們乾脆地離婚，就必須要打開離婚女子的出路，也就要打破這種「迷信」和這種不準確的貞操觀念。講到「迷信」方面，一個男子與「二婚」的女子結婚，爲何一定要不利：非但孫君的家長答不出來，我敢說任何人都要爲難的。但是與「二婚」女子，甚至與「白包頭」（一般人認爲更不利的寡婦）結婚，並沒有不利的影響；却到處可以找到例子。美國歷任的總統，其中倒有一半，他們的夫人是「白包頭」呢。至於貞操之一點，更不成問題了。我們於二月五日回答陳夢樵君的信裏，說「我們也深知愛情是不能同時容納一個人以上的，所以配偶雙方，對於對方的獨佔思想，認爲是不差的。但是在結婚前對方的貞操，似乎可以從寬。只須在結婚後，沒有第三者搊入，就行了。」何况一個離婚女子的第一次結婚，也是光明磊落，算不得不貞呢！</p>
<p>孫君的女友，具有「耐苦」·「和藹」·和「幹練」的三種美德：並且彼此的「性情」「舉止」相合。的確是一雙不可多得的佳偶，我們勸你一點不要遲疑，進行結婚可也。至於固執的雙親，初起當然難免不快，但是日子久了，看見並沒有不利的地方：他們也就可以安心的。</p>

<h3>詩禮人家（二四續）</h3>
<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>趙爾康的三房合一子·無端被人慘殺，心裡自然悲痛，他呈請地方官嚴緝兇手·一面與親家母大辦交涉，幼中說：「女婿在丈母家裏遇害，我們當然要負責任·現在死在門外街路上，與我們有什麼相干？」丈母娘更是蠻橫無理，險些鬧了一齣探親相罵的活劇。</p>
<p>幼中把趙爾康勸出門外來，偷偷的告訴他：黛秋以前原想嫁給鄭濟平的，後來因爲濟平的父母嫌黛秋的八字不好，才將婚事退了，但濟平依舊心不死，仍想娶黛秋爲妻，家棟的被殺，也許與此事有幾分關係吧。</p>
<p>趙爾康根據了幼中的報告，便以殺人罪控告鄭濟平，官廳也因此案毫無頭緒，捕拿了鄭濟平去，便可以求得一個線索，濟平到堂，將從前與黛秋戀愛與訂婚的經過，照直而供，又把恫嚇信呈案，說明退婚的理由。</p>
<p>夏幼中以家長資格到庭，證明黛秋向來嚴守閨訓，足不出戶，除了鄭濟平因親戚關係常在家中出入以外，其餘絕無與年輕男子交際之事，更談不到發生戀愛了，鄭濟平提出的匿名恐嚇信，犯了破壞黛秋名譽之罪，應請追究他的來源。</p>
<p>鄭濟平舉出許多證據，證明死者被殺之夜，他身在別處，斷無分身術前去殺人，但苦主說，殺人不一定要自己動手，儘可以買一個人出來行兇，所以主使殺人犯的嫌疑，他總逃不脫，結果，鄭濟平還是被押起來。</p>
<p>自從兇案發生以後，若華眼睛一閉，就會看見一個血肉模糊的女婿站在她面前，她恐怖極了，便拉着幼中在家裏陪伴着她，幼中一連多日沒有出門，那日忽有他的僕人阿海來找他，他連忙趕出去，與阿海談了一兩個鐘頭才進來，却引起了若華的疑慮，以爲他在外面另有情人，阿海是來通信的，問他何事，他說：</p>
<p>『阿海想請假回去，要借三個月工錢。』</p>
<p>過了三五天，阿海又來了，幼中又出去與他談話，若華越發疑心，悄悄地出去偷聽，他們在廂房裏談話，門窗關得很緊，不過是舊式的紙窗，不能隔別聲浪，所以被她聽得這樣一節談話：</p>
<p>『一百元酬勞金，已如數付清了，前天又額外貼給你三十元盤費，你非但不動身，今天又來借錢，開口就要五十，這成了敲詐性質了。』</p>

<h3>評福爾摩斯探案SherlookHolmes南京開映</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>誰都知道，「福爾摩斯」是柯南道爾的創作中的人物。關於這部偵探小說的改編電影，以前就有好些，這不過是小說中的一節。正因爲小說的改編，所以在結構上是很不費力的，只求演出能夠有條理的敘述出來而使其緊張化。那末，這一點上，到是本片不曾失敗的地方</p>
<p>克裡夫布魯克（ＣliveErook)飾福爾摩斯，可以說是頗能勝任的。假如他沒有那種　重的動作，那是不會將偵探家的特點描畫出來的，當他在劇中化裝一老婦而興大盜交談的時候，雖然是劇中須要如此而不使敵人窺察出來，可是我們只少須承認電影中的化裝，確是舞台劇所不及的，因爲燈光和攝影都能幫助不少。ErnestTarrence的表演，也很可以，他那可怕的臉孔，當然是幫助不少。其他諸人皆不足道。</p>
<p>導演在本片中也有可取之處，雖然故事是現有的，可是能夠利用陰影的美而使劇情更加緊張，然而有些不必要的場面，到是可以省略的。</p>

<h3>評殘花復艷</h3>
<p>— 郭聲宏</p>
<p>嘉寳傑作的「殘花復艷」去年曾在卡爾登映過，現在轉映於融光，這一部「殘花復艷」雖然是舊片，但是絕未給觀衆評過，所以作者物作一短評。</p>
<p>劇情的大意是描寫一個農女被乃叔所迫，逃入某工程師家中，二人竟發生變愛，軟玉溫香，儼然夫婦，好事多磨，二人因某種誤會，絕裾而去，後經種種波折，二人恢復舊好。</p>
<p>嘉寳在「殘花復艷」中的成績確比以前所主演的諸片進步得多，劇情本是哀怨纏綿，如泣如訴，現在經嘉寳演來，不得不使觀衆流了幾滴熱淚和共鳴之心，加以導演的手腕很靈潑和配角的一搭一擋的整齊，尤使「殘花復艷」生色不少。</p>
<p>收音很清晰，對白確比以前進步，語語動聽，佈景有幾幕很美術化，有幾幕簡直不行不過這不足「殘花復艷」減色的</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「生路」與「滿園春色」合評</h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>（生路）上海大戲院演蘇俄第一張到滬的影片「生路」TheＲoadtoＬive,本刊上早已詳細的介紹過。然而看了以後却如骨鯁在喉不吐不痛快，所以簡略的再談幾句。</p>
<p>這部片子最大成功，當然是表演了。一舉一動，無不深深打入了觀衆的心弦，牠不用疾言厲色的舊禮教來訓悔人，他沒一處不依了「人之常情」向前走，牠僅僅的寫實，述說着人性之愛，　衆之愛，貧民個人的痛苦，畸形社會下的共同悲哀，政府和人民應有的合作，國家　懂者對於細民應盡的責任······沒有一幕不是緊緊抓住了遍普人們的心情，反映出資本主義崩潰的根本主因。牠沒有醇酒美人的良宵美景，然而亦能呌我們精神上充份愉快。牠不是宣傳什麼的大聲疾呼，然而亦能呌我們類動共鳴。牠沒有特殊的魂力。但是在觀衆心理上能發生自然的反應。這是它的偉大之處。</p>
<p>在這片裏，牠放棄了一切的觀念，而順其自然的成就了牠的超越不凡，揭開了藝術的假面具，切實表白了藝術與人生的關係和真價值，牠指示出「人生的大道」一個人對於「生」Life應有認識，</p>
<p>摩登的小姐少爺們，可以不必去看這片子，牠是不能給你們滿足的，因爲牠缺少富麗堂皇的視聽之娛。牠給你們的是一些經濟社會像冰山一樣的冷酷。</p>
<p>末尾！我希望的，蘇俄二次巨片的來臨，作國難中醉生夢死的人們的一個警鐘。看了這種影片，我們才會明白，藝術之所以偉大，影片所負的重大使命，以及租界當局爲什麼要禁映了。</p>
<h3>佐麥克利之趣事</h3>
<p>— 玉侖</p>
<p>荒島怪人主角佐麥克利無論如何努力，總不能避去女人的糾纏。　　有一次，他又爲一個臨時女演員所困。爲避免這無謂的應酬起見，他於是向她說：『請你不要再和我談話，我的妻很不喜歡這樣的。』他說時，指著他一個女朋友當是他的妻。</p>
<p>那個臨時演員去了不數分鐘，她又跑來向麥克利說：『先生：剛纔我看見你的夫人和碧海（另外一個男子，是那位女朋友的情人）談得很親密：所以我很知道她不會反對你和我談話的。』</p>
<p>（滿園春色）這影片純粹是悲劇，本來「飲食男女，人之大懲」這問題不解决就根本談不到別的事丨丨根本丟失了人生的要義，牠指導出愛和慾爲一體，替感覺到「性的苦悶的靑年們，找一條出路。這出路就是不顧一切障礙而自求解放。如果「春色滿園關不住」的時候，你就不妨拋棄了社會和禮教的批評，來一個「一枝紅杏出牆來。」解决切身問題要緊，無須思前顧後。</p>
<p>當然，「享樂沒有好結果。」但是的確有許多人認爲這末尾的死，是一個完滿的人生結果　　這片子，牠也是向社會組織不良善進攻。牠表示「波華利夫人最先受了社會的束縛，才作出規外的行動，而社會偏不承認牠自己壓迫人家出此一途，反加勁壓迫，於是夫人只好作了社會鐵蹄下的犧牲者。我向夫人表著同情，欽佩她至死不屈。的確有多少受人批評作墮落的浪蕩者，他的動因，多一半是環境的逼迫和引誘，由苦悶而消極，由消極而浪漫而墮落。而且沒一個人能了解他，解釋那不是他本身的罪惡。</p>
<p>不過這片子的觀　　根本是由消極方面的，牠把人生看得極鬆。而「生路」是把人生看得極緊。牠說出現代社會的弱點，而不知設法補救，只是以個人的生命當兒戲般的去犧牲，我所以說這兩張片子的意旨是出於一途的。一個是消極抵抗，一個是積極改良。一出一入，所差可太遠了。「滿園春色」專述重在精神心靈的出脫而「生路」又主張物質同時解放，這一點上兩片也是背道而馳。</p>
<h3>國片出映芝城博覽</h3>
<p>聞已由教部選定十五部</p>
<p>美國芝加哥博覽會開會期間已快到了。據最近的消息，教育部已派員會同各影戲公司商議，由教育部選出我國國產影戲十五部前往芝加哥去放映展覽，聽說這當中聯華公司佔十二本，明星公司佔二本，天一公司一本，聯華當中的是有「奮鬬」·「戀愛與義務」·「野玫瑰」······等片·其他如明星與天一的都是比較在意識上可以過得去的·自然，以我國產影戲的幼稚，如果要同歐美的影戲業相比，那當然是不可能的事，不過爲發揚我國的民族精神及地位實在是件應即時舉行的事，所以我們希望這件事不要成了廢話。</p>

<p>(Peiping) Song Zewen, accompanied by Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhu Qingrun, and others, traveled in more than thirty cars to Rehe on the morning of the 17th to inspect the troops and discuss relief and military matters with Tang Yulin. Yesterday afternoon, all sectors of Chengde warmly welcomed them. Song delivered a speech expressing his determination to resist Japan, stating that the central government would do its best to provide assistance. Song and his party left Rehe at 3:30 PM yesterday and arrived in Peiping at 1:30 AM this morning. They continued their discussions at Prince Shuncheng's residence after getting off the train and dispersed at dawn. Song and his party's negotiations in Rehe were very successful. Tang firmly expressed that the Righteous Army would be completely under the control of the army to unify command. Last night, after all the issues were decided, twenty-seven generals, including Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Tang Yulin, and Sun Kuiyuan, issued anti-Japanese telegrams from Chengde, determined to fight bravely, follow the central government's policies, and spare no sacrifice. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chengde telegram: Tang expressed his deep gratitude for Song and Zhang's personal visit to Rehe and their concern for the province, and has conveyed this to the troops to encourage them to defend their territory. Zhang and Song visited Lingnan to inspect defenses and encourage the soldiers. Rehe province currency has been aided by the Central Bank and has increased in value. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang visited Song Zewen this afternoon and talked for a long time. Song attended the Northeast and Rehe Support Association this afternoon to report on his trip to Rehe. Representatives of the leaders of the Righteous Armies of Rehe went to Chengde to meet with Zhang, Song, and Tang, expressing their determination to defend their territory and coexist with Rehe. Song is scheduled to return to Tokyo by plane the day after tomorrow. Zhang Zuoxiang will accompany Zhang and Song to Rehe and has decided to be permanently stationed in Rehe to organize everything. (Special dispatch on the 19th) (Peiping) Song Zewen plans to leave Peiping by plane and return to Tokyo tomorrow morning. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang and others sent a telegram from Rehe, saying: Please be informed by all newspaper offices that since the September 18th Incident, sixteen months have passed in an instant. The country has been lost, the people have died, and the losses have been enormous, almost beyond calculation. Witnessing the difficulties of the times, our sorrow and anger are indescribable. At the beginning of the incident, in order to respect the covenant and maintain peace, we did not hesitate to endure humiliation and requested the League of Nations to arbitrate based on the covenant, hoping to achieve justice and realize fairness. Unexpectedly, the Japanese were greedy and took an inch to get a foot. We reasoned, but they relied on power. The more we yielded, the more they contested. The longer the time, the more severe the changes. Recently, they have resumed their fierce attacks, invading Yu and Rehe. Their intention is not only to regard our people's perseverance as weakness, but also to view all covenants as mere words. To this day, it is truly unbearable. We have no choice but to use armed self-defense and fight desperately as a plan to save the country and survive. Xueliang has long been determined to await trial. Now he has followed the central government's determined policy, led the troops, and actively proceeded, only seeking to benefit the party and the country, daring not to consider personal safety. The situation is urgent and pressing, and has reached this point. Without struggle, there is no way to survive. Without sacrifice, there is no way to save the dead. Even with one soldier and one soldier, we must continue our efforts. If we succeed, we can recover our homeland and wash away the greatest shame. If we fail, we can also boost our military reputation and promote the spirit of the nation. This time, accompanied by President Song to Rehe, we inspected the troops and tried our best to make the soldiers understand the great righteousness of defending the country and protecting the people. Our comrades have endured humiliation for a long time and have held resentment for a long time. After being instructed, they were all exceptionally indignant and wept to repay the country. However, this matter is of great importance and concerns the survival of the entire country. If there is any negligence in Rehe, it will inevitably affect North China. If North China is shaken, it will inevitably affect the entire country. This is of utmost importance. We hope that all wise men and compatriots across the country will share the difficulties of the times, rise up together, make powerful voices of support, and strive for the final victory. The telegram is urgent. Please take note. Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Tang Yulin, Wan Fulin, Sun Kuiyuan, Shen Ke, Feng Zhanhai, Li Haiqing, Deng Wen, Tan Zixin, Peng Zhenguo, Liu Zhendong, Feng Yong, Liu Guitang, Ding Futing, Liu Yueting, Xing Yuchou, Cui Xinwu, Zhang Congyun, Dong Futing, Liu Xianger, Fu Chun, Shi Wenhua, Sun Dequan, Yu Zhaolin, Wang Yongsheng, and Miao Chengliu respectfully kowtow. (18th) Seal (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Only today are newspapers allowed to publish the news of Zhang Xueliang, Song Zewen, and Zhang Zuoxiang's trip to Rehe. The three departed from Peiping on Friday. It is said that this trip has greatly strengthened military morale, and the soldiers are all willing to fight the enemy to the death. The three leaders finished their official business and left Rehe yesterday afternoon, arriving in Peiping early this morning. They are very tired from the long journey.

<h3>The Situation on the Border of Rehe, Where Storm Clouds Gather</h3>
<p>Tang Yulin Convenes Provincial Government Meeting</p>
<p>All Subordinate Officials Not Allowed to Take Leave</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Generals Meet in Tongliao</p>
<p>Discussing the Plan to Launch a General Attack on Rehe</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chengde telegram: Tang Yulin convened a provincial government meeting at noon on the 19th, deciding that all officials of the provincial government's departments and subordinate agencies are not allowed to take leave, as the great battle on the border of Rehe is about to begin. All regimental commanders in the front should send representatives to stay in the provincial capital. Tang Zuo, director of the Rehe Provincial Department of Finance, will temporarily stay in Rehe to rectify finances. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to Rehe intelligence, Zhang Haipeng, the puppet army responsible for attacking Guanlu, Yu Zhishan, for attacking Fuxin, and Cheng Guorui and Li Jichun, for attacking Chaoyang, met in Tongliao on the night of the 18th to discuss the plan to attack Rehe. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Uno Sajiro, commander of the Japanese military police in Tongliao, telegraphed on the morning of the 17th, summoning the commanders of the 6th, 8th, 9th, and 34th divisions of the Japanese army, the 49th Infantry Regiment, the 7th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment, and the puppet police chiefs Song Rong and the traitors Yu Zhishan, Zhang Haipeng, Cheng Guorui, and Li Jichun to Tongliao to discuss the plan for a general attack on Rehe. Zhang Haipeng and Yu Zhishan went to Tongliao on the evening of the 17th. The Japanese army near Kailu had a small contact with our army's Dadushan outposts nearly two months ago. The Japanese side transported a large amount of grain from Dahu to supply the military needs in Rehe. More than twenty Japanese planes have arrived in Tongliao. (Telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese army on the border of Rehe previously transmitted a general attack at the end of this month. However, due to the reversal of the League of Nations situation and the hesitation of domestic policy, there is another appearance of postponing the attack. According to Tokyo intelligence, the Japanese army on the border of Rehe may have large-scale actions in early March. Also, the Japanese Embassy in Peiping restricted Japanese residents, women, and children in Peiping, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou to go to Tanggu within two weeks to board ships and return to their country. According to investigation, it was only an order to prepare within two weeks. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) More than a thousand Mongolian bandits were found in Daoyingzi and Guojiadian in the Kailu area, commanded by the Japanese army, planning to attack Longtoujing in the west of our Kailu, and were repelled head-on by the Righteous Army Xie Jia Cui Brigade. Approximately ten thousand Japanese troops arrived in Tongliao. After the military deployment was completed, a general attack will be launched on our Kailu. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Yesterday, the Japanese army in Nanling again attacked Sanbaoyingzi and other places, and fought fiercely with Dong's brigade for a long time. Both sides suffered casualties. Japanese aircraft bombed Beipiao and Chaoyang yesterday. (Telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to a telegram report from Dong Futing in Chaoyang, the Japanese armored train parked in Nanling suddenly fired several shells at our positions yesterday afternoon. The shells landed on civilian houses in Nanling, causing only minor damage. Our positions were not moved. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The garrison in Kailu reported that the Righteous Army Feng Zhanhai's troops are firmly holding the area around Xiawa. The enemy is feeding their horses and sharpening their weapons. A war in Kailu is about to break out. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Wang Yunping, commander of the Righteous Army on the border of Rehe, said that our troops' attack plan is to divide the troops into two routes: the southern route concentrates in Suizhong, and the northern route concentrates in Dahushan, Xinlitun, Tongliao, and other places, planning to attack from Lingnan and Fuxin. All Manchurian troops are now concentrated in the front. Japan is training Manchurian soldiers, with one Japanese instructor training every one hundred and twenty people. There has been no major contact in the front recently. Two or three weeks ago, our army contacted the Japanese army in Fuxin. More than twenty Japanese soldiers were killed, and our side suffered slight casualties. At that time, a Japanese scout was captured. It is said that Japan is now seizing vehicles and repairing the Dache Road, planning to attack Rehe within a month. We have prepared aerial mines and Russian-style rapid-firing guns for defense against Japanese aircraft bombing. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>No War at Jiumenkou</h3>
<p>Japanese Army in Suizhong Hurriedly Building Motor Roads</p>
<p>(Peiping) There is no war outside Jiumenkou. The Japanese army is guarding Lijiabao and dare not attack again. There is no war on the Shibei front. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Linyu, 19th. A team of puppet troops, about two hundred people, and dozens of boxes of shells and cannons were reinforced by the enemy from Suizhong to Jiumenkou.

<p>League of Nations Members Watch the Development of the Rehe Situation</p>
<p>Japanese Delegation Begins to Draft a Statement</p>
<p>It Is Generally Expected That Japan May Not Leave the Meeting Immediately</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that the League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on the 21st. At the meeting on the 21st regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, it will be formally announced that mediation has failed. Then the meeting will be adjourned for two days and will continue to open on the 24th to formally discuss the report. The full text of the report has now been published. All countries in the world, except Japan, unanimously support and endorse it. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly will definitely pass it and will strive to implement it. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The report of the Special Committee of Nineteen has been published. The question of whether Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations is becoming more and more noteworthy. According to recent news from Geneva, the Japanese delegation is currently busy preparing a document, which Matsuoka will read at the League of Nations General Assembly on Tuesday or Friday, explaining Japan's attitude towards "Manchukuo" and the Special Committee's report. Then Matsuoka may withdraw from the League of Nations, but at present, people in Geneva generally expect that Japan may not immediately issue a formal notice of withdrawal from the League of Nations. According to news from Tokyo, the Japanese government has instructed Matsuoka to return to Japan at the end of this month to discuss the procedures before the government finally decides on the issue of leaving the meeting. The League of Nations Covenant stipulates that those who withdraw from the meeting must notify two years in advance. If Japan withdraws, it will still be a member of the League of Nations for the next two years and will have the obligation to respect the Covenant and abide by any recommendations of the League of Nations. (Reuters telegram on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Rehe is still the focus of attention for people in Geneva. Everyone is carefully studying the events there, because it is believed that the development of the Rehe situation has a great possibility in relation to the entire situation in the near future. Local newspapers today published in large print the news that Zhang Xueliang and Song Zewen had arrived in Rehe and that the Chinese delegation had sent a telegram from Zhang Xueliang to the League of Nations Secretariat declaring its determination to resist Japan.

<h3>Song Zewen's Anti-Japanese Telegram Arrives in London</h3>
<p>(London) Song Zewen, acting president of the Executive Yuan of China, telegraphed from Rehe, saying, "I swear in the name of the central government that I will never give up the Northeast. The enemy country may occupy Nanjing, but no one will make a treaty under the city. Our country's claims on the Northeast issue have been recognized as reasonable by the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations and have become the claims of the world. Eighteen million people died in the European War, so that the world could be improved. Now our country is truly blessed." (Havas Agency telegram on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Saionji Personally Instructs Saito</h3>
<p>Believes That It Is Not Yet Time to Withdraw from the League of Nations</p>
<p>Dreams That Major Countries Will Once Again Side with Japan</p>
<p>Saito Returns to Tokyo from Okitsu</p>
<p>Emergency Cabinet Meeting Convened This Morning</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito, after meeting with Elder Saionji, told Japanese reporters that this was the most important meeting to determine Japan's national policy, so he had to visit in person. The content of the discussion was very important and could not be made public for the time being. However, he believed that the most satisfying thing was that Elder Saionji fully agreed with the government's established policy and gave strong encouragement. Regarding the issue of withdrawing from the League of Nations, Elder Saionji said that there was no need to rush too much. Everything must be done with a calm attitude. It is best to first examine the situation at the League of Nations General Assembly on the 21st before making a final decision, because major countries may not all silently watch Japan's suffering without helping. Apart from this, no other issues were discussed. Although the world is rumored that this meeting involved discussions on internal affairs and military affairs in Rehe, these are all misunderstandings. (Hualian News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, after meeting with Elder Saionji, Saito declared to the press that the Japanese government has not yet decided whether to order its delegation in Geneva to leave Geneva immediately after issuing a statement on the counter-proposal at the League of Nations General Assembly. Japan's representative leaving Geneva does not mean that Japan is about to withdraw from the League of Nations. The Japanese counter-proposal to the League of Nations is currently being drafted at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It will be discussed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. It is expected that the statement will be submitted in Geneva on the 21st of this month. (Reuters telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito formally met with Saionji at noon today. Prime Minister Saito gave a detailed report on the process of the League of Nations mediation, the diplomatic attitudes of various governments, and the content of the report of the Committee of Nineteen. Afterwards, Saito and Saionji discussed the attitude to be taken towards the report of the Committee of Nineteen and the external policies that the Japanese government should take after the report was adopted at the League of Nations General Assembly in an unusually tense atmosphere. Other military matters related to the invasion of Rehe were discussed in extreme secrecy. The important meeting lasted for one hour and twenty minutes, and he left at 3:24 PM. It is heard that Prime Minister Saito, after the meeting, had a very important determination and rushed back to Tokyo immediately to prepare for the emergency cabinet meeting tomorrow morning to discuss and decide on the final fundamental policy with the cabinet members. (Hualian telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The emergency temporary cabinet meeting is scheduled to continue at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning. The main agenda items are based on the decision of the temporary cabinet meeting on the 17th to oppose the recommendation of the Committee of Nineteen and to recall the Japanese delegation and implement military matters related to the invasion of Rehe. The most important decision will be made at tomorrow's cabinet meeting on the issue of formally withdrawing from the League of Nations. However, whether the Japanese government's decision can be announced immediately after the cabinet meeting is still a question, or because the matter involves important international relations, it must wait for the Japanese representative to return to the country and hold another meeting of senior officials for deliberation and approval before it can be announced.

<h3>Japanese Veterans Association Congress</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Veterans Association believes that the current major situation cannot be ignored. The chairman, General Suzuki, and the heads of the army and navy headquarters decided on the attitude that the Veterans Association should take. As a result, a message was sent to three million veterans across the country, and a congress will be convened at the Yasukuni Shrine on the 21st, moving forward together. (Dentsu News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>National Citizens' Congress</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In parallel with the National Congress of the Japanese Veterans Association, the National Citizens' Congress, aiming at withdrawing from the League of Nations, is scheduled to be held at the Hibiya Public Hall at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. Government officials, including Foreign Minister Uchida, Army Minister Araki, and Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai, will attend. Private sector leaders, such as Touyama Mitsuru and Tokutomi Sohō, will attend and will deliver passionate speeches. (Dentsu News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Uchida Strongly Advocates Withdrawal</h3>
<p>Moving Towards the East Asian Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida believes that the recommendation accompanying the report has caused a crack in Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo," so Japan has no choice but to withdraw. Therefore, with this attitude, he has strongly advocated this point at the cabinet meetings since the 17th. He is also doing his utmost to persuade the Prime Minister, who is under the will of Saionji, at tomorrow's cabinet meeting, and is confident that he will be able to implement his proposal. At the same time, Foreign Minister Uchida is discussing international diplomatic policies after withdrawing from the League of Nations with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In this situation, at the time of notifying the withdrawal, the abstract policy of international coordination will be rapidly changed to a substantive coordination policy with countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Russia, so as to adjust diplomatic relations between countries. In the Far East, an agreement on the fundamental security guarantee of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" will be decided, and the Monroe Doctrine of the Far East will be established, so as to move forward according to this policy. (Dentsu News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Former Foreign Minister Shidehara was worried about the deterioration of the situation in the League of Nations and visited Saionji in Okitsu on the 14th to express important opinions. It is reported that Shidehara recently told a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the situation has reached this point, and the only option is to withdraw from the League of Nations. Shidehara, who has always followed the diplomatic path, has made such a statement, which is worthy of attention. (Dentsu News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Self-Comforting Psychology</h3>
<p>Expects That Article 16 Will Not Be Invoked</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese are worried that if they decide to withdraw from the League of Nations and invade Rehe, the League of Nations will recognize it as an act of war and invoke the sanctions provisions of Article 16, imposing military or economic sanctions on Japan. However, according to information obtained by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, both Britain and France will not impose military sanctions, and economic blockade is not considered a problem. Even if China files a complaint regarding the invasion of Rehe, there may be disagreements as to whether it is considered a war. Countries that consider it a war will bear military force, and countries that do not consider it a war will determine that this kind of armed behavior cannot be equated with an act of war. Therefore, it is impossible for the League of Nations countries to act unanimously. Moreover, the British side has warned that although there are sanctions that do not use military force, such sanctions also violate peace. Therefore, no matter how agitated the officials of small countries are and raise the issue of sanctions, it is not easy to apply Article 16. (Dentsu News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between the United States and Russia With the League of Nations Can Increase the Power to Sanction Japan</h3>
<p>Editorial of the British Newspaper</p>
<p>(London) What action will the League of Nations take if Japan does not accept the recommendations of the Special Committee of Nineteen? This is the question discussed in today's newspaper editorials. The future development of The Sunday Times largely depends on the attitudes of the United States and Russia. If they fully cooperate with the League of Nations, Japan's position will be very difficult. Because Japan feels isolated in the world and has no friends, it will have to reconsider this matter. Even if it does not immediately change its course, it will definitely change its policy when it feels the full impact of the world's condemnation and the difficulties of fighting in China. The newspaper also mentioned the possibility of war in China, saying that the prohibition of arms shipments to the Far East and foreign debts can have a moderate and rapid effect. But the most important thing is moral judgment. Britain, in any case, will not participate in military sanctions. The Observer also said that the League of Nations will not have the issue of using force, because the League of Nations using force is tantamount to suicide. The newspaper also said that the League of Nations has made a mistake in not encouraging direct negotiations between China and Japan from the beginning. The only good purpose in Geneva at present is to eliminate hatred in the Far East. (Reuters telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Russia is Raised Again</h3>
<p>The U.S. Senate Is Considering It</p>
<p>(Washington) Key figures here and some diplomats familiar with Eastern events, after carefully reading the recommendations of the Committee of Nineteen regarding the Manchurian case, mostly believe that the proposal of the negotiating committee is equivalent to a kind of diplomatic gesture. Because if Japan refuses to have contact with the League of Nations again, it will probably not accept the negotiation proposal. Conversely, if Japan accepts any mediation proposal, there will be no need to establish a negotiating committee. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the negotiating committee can meet. Someone even said that the entire proposal has the appearance of being a mere gesture, so as to open the way for future negotiations with Japan and relieve the League of Nations of the responsibility of ending the current discussion. In addition, most diplomats doubt the participation of the United States and Russia. According to news from Geneva, Russia's views are similar to those of the United States, and Russian diplomats mostly treat the proposal for the Soviet Union to participate indifferently. However, since the theory of Soviet Russia's participation in resolving a foreign dispute has been put forward from time to time, it has naturally caused the revival of the movement for the United States to recognize Soviet Russia. Senator King expects that the advocates of recognition will try to convene a meeting on the issue of resuming diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia as soon as possible. Today, he submitted a motion authorizing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to convene a meeting to discuss the political and economic situation of Soviet Russia, and claiming that the U.S. Senate currently lacks sufficient reports to decide on the issue of recognition. Therefore, he proposed this motion, and he advocated that the issue of resuming diplomatic relations should not be discussed before the committee's investigation report is completed.

<h3>Secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party Loudly Calls</h3>
<p>To Strengthen the Strength of the Red Army</p>
<p>Armed Maintenance of Peace</p>
<p>(Moscow) Gaganovich, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting of advanced team members of collective farms yesterday. Gaganovich first said that the success of the first five-year plan has made the Soviet Union a powerful and independent country. He then said that the current enemies of the Soviet Union all believe that the Soviet Union should be given close attention, because it not only has simple military equipment, but also has sophisticated modern weapons. Therefore, if we do not develop the foundation of industry in a short period of time, then what we have now will not be peaceful work, but war and intervention. Imperialists will definitely attack the Soviet Union from the east and west. Although the five-year plan has given us peace, we cannot blindly live in a fool's paradise. We should remember that imperialists can attack the Soviet Union at any time, and we should warn the workers in the country with this intention. Our diplomats are now fighting for peace and extending our views to all countries in the world. If there are countries in the world that sincerely seek peace, it must be our country. Our country is building a new life. In order to seek world peace, our country advocates disarmament and asks to sign non-aggression treaties with other countries. Most countries have signed non-aggression treaties with our country, but Japan has not. However, if Japan intends to seek peace, it must also take this step. However, in order to maintain peace, we also do not just engage in empty talk. We cannot pray for peace without preparation. We should strengthen war preparedness and the strength of the Red Army. This army has been established for fifteen years and represents our country's armed cultural forces, and is also the main force for defending our country's borders. (TASS telegram on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Overt Warfare and Undeclared Warfare | National Warfare and Localized Warfare</h3>
<p>— Nai</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese dispute, after one year and five months of futile mediation efforts, has reached a critical juncture today. Why do we say this? Now that the report has been passed by the special committee of nineteen nations, the passage of the report by the General Assembly is almost a certainty. In the future, will the League of Nations maintain the dignity of treaties and impose economic pressure on Japan? If so, the start of a major war in the Far East is undoubtedly a foregone conclusion. Or will it remain a dead letter, used as a pretext to step down? If so, China's future strategy towards Japan must also change course and adopt more decisive measures. Recently, the Japanese have been preparing for war, acting aggressively. Regardless of whether this is intended to intimidate the League of Nations or to demonstrate strength to our country, seizing Jehol is an inevitable step for them. Therefore, the continuation of war is almost unavoidable.</p>
<p>The overthrow of the Qing Dynasty was not due to a conflict between Manchus and Han, but rather to the result of powerful officials flattering foreigners and harming the country. Similarly, the downfall of the Northern Warlords was largely due to diplomatic failures. The Xinhai Revolution was originally an opportunity for China to strive for strength, but over the past decades, internal strife has severely weakened the country, leading to the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident. Overnight, three provinces were lost. When the alarming news arrived, we were at a loss. Examining the origins and causes, today's prominent figures in both the government and the public share the blame. Reflecting on the past and remaining vigilant about the future, the lessons of the past are not far off, and the same mistakes should not be repeated. Those who erred in the past must not be allowed to err again in the future. At a time when the enemy is advancing deeply and public sentiment is seething, enduring humiliation and seeking peace will be judged by the people. Those who refuse to mobilize and hesitate to avoid the responsibility of resisting the enemy will not be tolerated by the entire nation. The way to preserve oneself and save the country lies only in resolutely fighting the brutal Japanese, putting everything on the line, and leaving no other option.</p>
<p>What constitutes warfare? It should be overt warfare, not undeclared warfare. This is the first point. Why do we say this? Firstly, the Sino-Japanese war is a struggle between a semi-colony and an imperialist power. The key to victory lies not in military strength, but in the united resistance of the nation's masses. To inspire the masses to resist, there must be an overt declaration of war to ignite the people's emotions and create a surge in the struggle. Secondly, even if we only consider military strength, the resistance of a semi-colony against an imperialist power relies not on advanced weaponry, but on fearless hand-to-hand combat. This kind of fearless courage depends on the authorities inspiring the people with righteous words from above, and the people encouraging each other with the thought of dying for the country. With mutual support, they can persevere without wavering. Show them the determination to have no turning back, make them understand that there is no alternative to war except death, and a desperate stand can lead to survival. A righteous cause makes the army strong, and only then can its importance be revealed. If we are at war but afraid to openly declare it, it means we are fighting indecisively. Those in power may claim to be careful in handling matters, but those below will inevitably believe that there is room for compromise. If the meaning of sacrifice is unclear, the momentum of a righteous and strong cause will inevitably be diminished. It will be difficult to predict success or failure when dealing with a powerful enemy in this way. Furthermore, the current divisions in political opinions are an undeniable fact. The reason for these divisions is the lack of a decisive foreign policy. The only way to achieve consensus is to openly declare war to dispel doubts and resolve confusion. Facts speak loudest. When the Song Dynasty fell, the people wanted war, but high officials advocated peace. The generals and soldiers were caught between the two, feeling at a loss and hesitant, which weakened their morale. War is a collective action. When the people are united, mountains can be shaken. But when they are indecisive, defeat is inevitable. The lessons of history are clear. We should know how to conduct ourselves.</p>
<p>It should be national warfare, not localized warfare. This is another point. Why do we say this? In the distant past, the wars fought by the Qing Dynasty against foreign powers, such as the wars against Britain, France, Japan, and the Allied forces, were all localized wars. Ito Hirobumi told the Japanese emperor that he was using the strength of the entire nation to confront a localized army, and that victory was assured. This was a clear understanding of both sides. Localized warfare is the path to defeat, which is quite evident. More recently, during the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, one side suffered bitter fighting while the other side engaged in celebratory banquets. If there had been a national war, the defense of the coast would not have been a problem. How could enemy ships have been allowed to remain in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River? All these contradictions and missed opportunities for military action were of minor consequence, but they caused misunderstanding among the people and weakened the fighting spirit of the soldiers, which was a major disaster. In short, seeking temporary peace and security stems from selfishness. The stability of the people is merely a pretext for warlord separatism. The combination of the two has led to this localized warfare in which each party acts on its own without mutual coordination or assistance. The result is tantamount to automatically dismembering the vast national body and offering it to the enemy as food.</p>
<p>Therefore, so-called undeclared warfare is the most convenient way for imperialists to conquer weak nations. In their conquest, they have no legitimate reason to invoke and no legal or treaty provisions to rely on. If they were to openly declare war, they would be exposing their own crimes. Therefore, they prefer to wage war silently in order to achieve de facto victory. The Japanese imperialists already have a strong military force and do not need a declaration of war to boost morale. It can be said that it has all the advantages and no disadvantages. Furthermore, so-called localized warfare is the most appropriate way for a small country to annex a large nation. They use force to seize one part and use coercion and enticement to suppress movement in other parts. Over time, they wait for the completion of the training of the traitorous forces and then use the hands of the conquered to attack their own. This allows them to sit back and reap the benefits. The Northeast has been lost for more than a year, but the area south of the Great Wall remains a lucrative market for Japanese imperialists. On one hand, they use trade to plunder the blood and sweat of the people of mainland China, transferring it to support the traitorous forces in the Northeast. On the other hand, they use the traitorous forces in the Northeast to gradually invade mainland China. There is no better plan than this. Do the Chinese people still think that undeclared warfare and localized warfare are advantageous? I fear they are merely serving as tools for the Japanese.</p>
<p>In summary, we believe that in today's war: Firstly, we should avoid the term "declaration of war" in international law. However, domestically, we must have a resolute commitment to open warfare. Secondly, we must place the entire nation under a state of war, directing all guns outward. Maintaining stability can only be considered a secondary action to consolidate the rear in wartime.</p>

<h3>Wang Jia Lie's Telegram to Nanjing Reporting on the Guizhou Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Guizhou Chairman Wang Jia Lie telegraphed Nanjing, saying: "Our Guizhou is unfortunate, disasters occur frequently, with both external and internal troubles endlessly cycling. The political situation is precarious, and the people are in dire straits. Furthermore, the Japanese are recklessly causing disturbances in the Northeast, seizing our territory, and infringing upon our sovereignty, causing a national catastrophe and the pain of national extinction. We should urgently abandon our prejudices and vigorously resist foreign aggression. From the day I, Jia Lie, was stationed in western Hunan, I planned to volunteer to fight the Japanese and repeatedly telegraphed the central government, requesting to go to the front lines. I was honored by the central government's trust and ordered to return to Guizhou Province, concurrently serving as military and civilian leader. I repeatedly and firmly declined, but my request was not granted. Respecting the orders of the central government and understanding the hearts of the people, I thought of breaking the concept of regionalism, forcefully preventing one faction from controlling everything, unifying the command of the army, and eradicating the evil system of defense zones. However, You and Jiang, two traitors, harbored personal prejudices and were intent on controlling everything. Seeing that the central government and provincial committees did not adopt the idea of regionalism, they falsely claimed that Jia Lie was undermining the group and colluding with outsiders. They then issued a telegram opposing me under false pretenses, instigating Xie's group to rebel and disrupt the security of Guizhou Province. Considering the local situation, Jia Lie did not immediately condemn them, but You, Jiang, and others became even more reckless, acting arbitrarily, coercing Mao Gong to use him as a figurehead, issuing telegrams without authorization, confusing the public, fabricating rumors, and arbitrarily slandering me. They also intercepted military pay and blockaded the economy, killing Li Yongshao, the magistrate of Dading County, and assassinating Liu Shigang, a member of the Zhenning Committee. Jia Lie, considering the national crisis, showed great tolerance. However, the rebels remained unrepentant, their habits ingrained in their nature. They even dared to send troops to rob funds and attack cities, colluding with their cronies to advance on the provincial capital. In order to maintain discipline and defend the people, Jia Lie initially sent troops to attack. Bijie and Zunyi collapsed at the first sight of our forces. The rebels then resorted to treacherous tactics, bribing the rebellious soldiers on our side, seizing the opportunity to besiege the provincial capital. Jia Lie, unwilling to see the best area suffer the calamity of a mutiny, led his troops away from the province to quell the dispute. I resolved to lead my troops to request orders from the central government to resist Japan, in order to avoid further conflict. However, You and Jiang, two traitors, entrenched themselves in the provincial capital, usurping power and authority, assuming the title of chairman, and recruiting bandits, poisoning the people. The whole province, both inside and outside, was resentful and heartbroken. They even sent rebel troops to pursue and attack my army, following closely behind, trying to eliminate my forces by violence. All the officers and soldiers were indignant. Therefore, when the army reached Rongjiang, following the request of the soldiers and civilians, we reorganized our troops and launched a counterattack with all our might. All the rebel forces were completely defeated. You and Jiang, two traitors, disregarded the people's wishes, held fast to the city, determined to engage in street fighting, and hatched a vicious plan to set fires. They also cut off food supplies, sealed off fuel, and looted and requisitioned goods, behaving no differently from bandits. Jia Lie stationed troops inside the city and halted for ten days, truly wanting to urge the rebels to repent and save the people from fire and water. Now the provincial capital is safe, and the rebel forces have collapsed. You and Jiang, two traitors, have fled to the Sichuan border in a state of utter disarray. With the war over, order has been restored. Jia Lie will, in the shortest possible time, stabilize the entire province. In employing people and administering the government, I will uphold impartiality. All measures and facilities will be based on the will of the people. Finances will be completely transparent, and expenses will be reduced as much as possible. However, the local area is devastated, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt. I have heard that the traitor You Guocai has fled to the capital, engaging in activities everywhere, deceiving all parties, and wanting to revive his dead ashes and cause further suffering to our homeland. In addition to requesting the central government to issue an arrest warrant, I also hope that overseas villagers will unite to drive out this evil demon. (19th Special Dispatch)"</p>

This order also appointed Liu Qifeng as a member of the Examination Yuan. This order also appointed Cheng Qilu and Jiang Chaoyue as secretaries of the Disciplinary Committee of Political Officials of the National Government concurrently.

<h3>Serious Repercussions in Germany After the Deterioration of Franco-Italian Relations, Austria in a Dilemma</h3>
<p>▲ Vienna Dispatch, 18th: Since the French ambassador protested in an aggressive tone about Italian munitions being transported to the Hirtenberg Arsenal for repairs, Austria has suddenly faced a serious crisis. It is now expected that, given the anger of the people, the Austrian government may not yield to French conditions. It is likely that its response will only reiterate the intent of the previous dispatch, explaining that this move was purely a private matter. If the Hirtenberg Arsenal can obtain an order to repair 40,000 old-fashioned rifles and its work does not violate the treaty, the Austrian government sees no reason to interfere. However, Austria is currently financially dependent on France. If France refuses to underwrite its share of the League of Nations' new debt, it will cause a financial panic in Austria. Therefore, the Austrian government is currently in a dilemma. Austrian newspapers commenting on this matter believe that Austria is currently between the devil and the deep blue sea. The French know this and are therefore putting pressure on it to make Austria an easy tool for implementing its policies, eventually forcing it to join the Little Entente and complete the iron wall blockading Italy. Therefore, most newspapers anticipate that the Dollfuss cabinet, having encountered this complete deadlock, will be forced to resign. However, no newspaper dares to predict how things will develop after that, only saying that this matter will definitely increase the already serious tensions in Europe.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin Dispatch, 18th: The German political circles were greatly surprised when they heard that the French and British ambassadors had sent a threatening note to the Austrian government. The newspapers, regardless of party affiliation, expressed indignation, saying that its content and manner were unprecedented. The World Newspaper said that the note no longer wanted to hide its intention to bully small countries. At a time when the disarmament conference is seeking to eliminate discriminatory treatment after the war, we must, with extraordinary courage, eliminate the last claim of such events. The National Socialist Party's organ newspaper said that if the French attempt to achieve great ambitions in Austria to advance their selfish interests, it is by no means something that Germany can allow. The Posen Daily called it an unprecedented act of provocation by France and Britain, ridiculing the British for being so completely bound by the French Danube policy and wanting to be a faithful agent of Geneva. Isn't that strange? The German Daily said that this move by Britain and France has made the European situation even more acute, and it is tantamount to pronouncing the death penalty on Geneva.</p>
<p>▲ Rome Dispatch, 18th: The most concerned matter in Italy now is still the French note to the Austrian government requesting the return of the Hirtenberg munitions. Italian people are quite indignant at this move by France, because they believe that this move by France is mostly directed against Italy, and its purpose is not in Austria. News has come from Paris that this kind of note from France was actually jointly presented to Austria by France and Britain a long time ago. However, Italian public opinion believes that this is not enough to alleviate the provocative nature of the French note, and the fact that France only chose Austria, which has no military resistance, to humiliate, while turning a blind eye to the daily transport of large quantities of munitions into Yugoslavia by the Czechs, further shows the unfairness of France's attitude. In addition, the Italian Popolo Newspaper recently published a section of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's remarks, in which Mussolini said that a large-scale enemy spy agency was discovered in Vienna, the capital of Austria, and its leader was a French military attache. Therefore, Mussolini believes that France must already have a military action plan in southern Europe, and this plan is entirely directed against Italy.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Budapest Dispatch, 18th: Hungarian newspapers continue to comment on the event of the Balkan Little Entente countries concluding a new treaty, generally believing that it is a tool of aggression both internally and externally. The Magyarország Newspaper said that the Little Entente countries are deeply afraid of the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Austria, so they concluded the above treaty to counter it, which is an overestimation.</p>
<h3>The Disarmament Conference Suspends</h3>
<p>German Representative Returns Home for Instructions</p>
<p>▲ Berlin Dispatch, 18th: Nadolny, the chief representative of Germany attending the League of Nations Disarmament Conference, suddenly departed from Geneva today to return to Germany in order to discuss all matters related to disarmament with Prime Minister Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath. This is because France has recently proposed to abolish the formal army, organize local militia groups, and want to standardize the militia organizations of all European countries. Germany has raised a reservation on this. After Nadolny consulted with the German Foreign Ministry via long-distance telephone, he packed his bags and returned home, and the meeting of the Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference had to be temporarily suspended to await the return of the German representative on Tuesday. Currently, the German Foreign Ministry believes that the intention of France's proposed standardization of the army is nothing more than to dismantle Germany's national defense forces. Therefore, Nadolny's raising of reservations is quite gratifying to public opinion, and they hope that the government will not relax its original intention of seeking equality of armaments among international countries.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris Dispatch, 18th: Hadr, the acting chief representative of France at the Disarmament Conference, said in a speech at the conference the other day that "the army is evil, and the barracks are the source of rebellion," which has aroused the indignation of most newspapers in Paris. Only the newspapers of the Radical Party in Paris and the provinces and the semi-official Le Petit Parisien wrote articles to defend him. The right-wing newspapers unanimously condemned him and demanded the immediate recall of this young and inexperienced politician. The French newspapers made a lot of noise about this matter, but they were very calm about the very important matter of the note to Austria. It is said that its intention is to divert the public's attention and prevent them from knowing the dangers contained in the move against Austria.</p>
<h3>The Significance of France and Russia Approving the Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>Russian Newspapers Hope to Further Enhance Economic Relations</p>
<p>▲ Tass, Moscow Dispatch, 18th: The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" published a long article today on the ratification of the Franco-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, saying that this move has completed the entire phase of the development of Franco-Soviet relations. It is said that after the failure of the French-led policy of intervention in the Soviet Union, Herriot began a period of recognition of the Soviet Union. However, at this time, the relationship between the two countries was still fluctuating. When reactionaries were in power, Franco-Soviet relations were threatened. Reactionaries strongly opposed the signing of the Franco-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty. Therefore, the current ratification of this treaty has great political importance. As for the motive of the French government's approval of this treaty, the newspaper said that it is not unrelated to the French military's excessive emphasis on the Soviet Union's economic and military strength. From this observation, the French government came to two conclusions: to further strengthen France's military strength or to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Fortunately, the French government took the second conclusion. In the Soviet Union itself, the ratification of this non-aggression treaty can be regarded as an important development of its peaceful policy. In order to maintain peace and avoid new wars, the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate with any country. Recently, Litvinov's proposal at the Disarmament Conference has aroused much praise from the French newspapers. The Soviet Union hopes that France can understand the basic intention of Litvinov's proposal, not only as a theoretical endorsement, but also as a practical manifestation. However, what a country relies on to survive is not only peace, but also bread. Therefore, the true manifestation of Franco-Soviet friendship lies in the enhancement of the economic relations between the two countries. The friendship between France and the Soviet Union is an element of peace in Europe and Asia, and not to deal with any country. The Soviet Union's policy is to maintain the closest and most friendly relations with all countries.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Assassination Case</h3>
<p>Five More Suspects Arrested in Los Angeles</p>
<p>▲ Miami Dispatch, 18th: Regarding the roundup of the Roosevelt case, five more suspects have been arrested here. During questioning today, they confessed to having sent a letter to Newhart, stating the assassination attempt on Roosevelt, with the words "Our bricklayer comrades failed" in the letter, but did not openly mention the assassination attempt.</p>
<h3>French Civil Servants to Strike and Demonstrate Today</h3>
<p>Opposing Salary Cuts</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris Dispatch, 18th: It is reported that the Civil Servants' Federation will order its members to stop working for one hour on Sunday to express their opposition to salary cuts for civil servants. According to this salary cut, the Ministry of Finance has already decided to balance the budget. ▲ Havas, Paris Dispatch, 18th: Members of the municipal and provincial autonomous agencies and veterans of the European War are extremely agitated by the measures decided by the Senate Finance Committee to save expenses. Recently, the Civil Servants' Federation issued a flyer, accusing the "Senate of provocative behavior." The elementary school teachers and autonomous agency staff committees of the Seine Province issued declarations with strong wording. In addition, various civil servants' associations ordered their members to stop part of their work on Sunday. The detailed methods will be determined by each association. The Veterans' Federation of the European War also plans to march in a group to express their protest.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Beirut Dispatch, 18th: The Civil Servants' Federation is currently preparing to hold a demonstration on Sunday to protest the Senate Finance Committee's decision on salary cuts. The general public expects the demonstration to be quite chaotic. On that day, staff members of some agencies, especially postal and telecommunications agencies, may go on strike several times.</p>
<h3>Prediction of the Second Major Earthquake in Japan</h3>
<p>The Earthquake Zone Will Be on the Kii Peninsula</p>
<p>Ground Changes Gradually Moving South</p>
<p>▲ According to the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, Dr. Akitsune Imamura, the doyen of the seismological community, with the support of the Imperial Academy, has been conducting research on the block movements of the Kii Peninsula for several years. On the 13th of this month, he announced a shocking fact at the general meeting of the Academy, namely, the southern part of Nankaido has been found to be tilting southward, and the central part of the peninsula is also tilting. In the past four years, there has been a trend of southward tilting. This is quite related to the great ground burst of the previous year. In the past, there have been several earthquakes in Nankaido, similar in nature to the previous Great Kanto Earthquake. At that time, tilting ground movements also occurred before the great earthquake. Since the doctor received assistance from the Army Land Survey Department to investigate the future major earthquakes that will occur in Nankaido, according to the results of the leveling survey by the Survey Department, the tilting of the southern part of the peninsula has gradually reached the central part. Therefore, it is difficult to avoid the coming of the major earthquake on the Kii Peninsula. However, before the major earthquake,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>, due to the change in the direction of the tilting ground movement, a major gap will inevitably occur. At the same time, through detailed investigations by Professor Terada and Assistant Professor Tsuboi of the Earthquake Research Institute of the Imperial University, it was found that due to the explosion of the Kamewase Tunnel last year, the activity of the Tadami Fault, along the approximately 100 kilometer line under Nara, Osaka, and Wakayama prefectures, has suddenly revealed more than ten places of ground creep. After the publication of this research, abnormal panic has occurred throughout the country.</p>
<h3>Japan's Huge Budget</h3>
<p>Military Expenses Account for One-Third of the Total</p>
<p>Public Debt Increases by More Than 100 Million</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo Communication, 14th: According to the announcement by the Ministry of Finance, the expenses of the army and navy for the 1933-34 fiscal year totaled more than 819,000,000 yen, accounting for 26.57% of the total national expenses for that year. Expenses for national bonds have increased from 259,000,000 yen in the previous year to 370,000,000 yen. However, in terms of the percentage of total national expenses, it has decreased from 31.49 to 27.45. In that year, due to the opening of relief projects, the subsidy item has greatly increased compared to 1932-33, an increase of more than 22,000,000 yen, but it has decreased in the percentage of total national expenses.</p>
<h3>Russo-Japanese War Machine</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Loses Face to Japan</p>
<p>Japan's Policy of Occupying Seaports Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>▲A London dispatch from the New York Times reports that news continues to arrive about Japan's ongoing activities in Manchuria. How this situation will affect the overall national situation is a constant topic of discussion here. The Sino-Japanese dispute is currently a matter before Geneva, it is true. However, the consequences of Japan's actions on the Asian continent form a more important issue, one that seems to be overlooked by the general public: namely, the loss of prestige for the Soviet Union. Harbin has been a sphere of Russian influence for decades. Now it has been occupied by Japanese troops for several months. This action has made the Rising Sun flag's reach even greater than during the Russo-Japanese War of 1909. And Moscow has only issued a mild protest. It is rumored that the Red Army is concentrated east of Lake Baikal to prevent attacks, but nothing significant has happened. After consolidating its position in Harbin, Japan continues to advance along the Chinese Eastern Railway, under the pretext of "Manchukuo" suppressing bandits. One wing is reaching the border of the Amur Province, and another is heading west towards the Irkutsk Province. The occupation is almost complete. The Japanese side is encroaching upon Russia's sphere of influence in this way, and the Russian government is allowing this provocation without question. It seems that everything built with Russian funds related to the Chinese Eastern Railway and its operations has been completely lost. This blow that Japan has delivered to Soviet Russia is perhaps even heavier than the one it delivered to China. But the Russian government remains calm and endures it meekly. Is this the Russian government's foresight, or is it the result of its decision not to interfere in the Sino-Japanese conflict, or is it because it knows its own weakness and dares not compete with Japan, or perhaps the Russian authorities fear that going to war will trigger internal strife and make it impossible to maintain their power? In any case, no matter how it is answered, the Soviet Union's prestige in the Far East has undoubtedly fallen to the point of extinction. Not only in the Far East, but also in Europe, we have felt the repercussions of the Soviet Union's submission to Japan. Countries along the Baltic Sea, which used to fear Russia like a tiger, have now changed their attitude. Finns, Estonians, and Latvians no longer seem to worry about attacks from their giant neighbor to the east. To express it in a Chinese proverb, Soviet Russia has lost face. No matter how much we dislike the Moscow government, we cannot help but acknowledge that this situation is a common loss for all countries with interests in the Far East, and we regret the softening of the Russian government. After occupying Harbin and straddling the Chinese Eastern Railway, Japan's position to resist Red Army attacks has been greatly strengthened. If war does break out, it can send a covering army to the western Xing'an Mountains to cut off traffic between Vladivostok and Siberia, and then slowly resolve the Russian troops isolated in the coastal provinces. Now that the Russian army has lost its direct line of communication in Manchuria, it may consider detouring through the Amur River basin for transportation. However, there are more than a dozen places along that route where the railway can be quickly cut off, and this is not even necessary, because the Japanese army only needs to launch a surprise attack towards Chita, severing the connection between the Amur Railway and the Siberian trunk line, and then traffic east of Chita will be completely cut off. If Japan continues to develop agriculture in southern Manchuria according to its plan, while stationing a large army in northern Manchuria, it can become a buffer against Soviet influence. In other words, Japan is organizing Manchuria as a huge base for future attacks on the Soviet Union. The first step is now underway. The goal of Tokyo in 1905 was to occupy Vladivostok, so that Europe would have no outlet to the Pacific Ocean. In the end, due to the intervention of the United States, the goal was not achieved, but its policy has never changed. It is likely that the time to realize this old plan is not far away. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations due to the breakdown of Geneva, then the crisis is near. This is what we can predict. (World Press)</p>
<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from Rehe: To all newspaper offices, please note that Qinglan, on the 17th, together with representatives of the Shanghai Local Association Huang Renzhi, Mu Ouchu, Yan Fuqing, Yang Zhixiong, Hu Junzhuang, and Du Chongliao, as well as comrades from the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association, came to Chengde, Rehe, to discuss with local people's organizations various ways to relieve the suffering compatriots in the Northeast and to support patriotic and courageous generals and soldiers. At this time when the national crisis is tightening day by day, it is time to share the same boat and cross the river together. Now, President Song of the Executive Yuan, along with the military authorities and generals in North China, Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, and Tang Yulin, are also in Rehe, jointly discussing the great plan to resist aggression. They are all determined to strengthen border defense and recover lost territory. The people of Rehe and the soldiers at the front are all encouraged and striving harder upon hearing this good news. From now on, all parties in the country will rise up together, unite sincerely, and go to the national crisis together. The future of saving the country is deeply dependent on this. We hope that people in all regions will contribute money and efforts to support the rear, so that our 30 million compatriots in the Northeast can get out of the abyss of suffering as soon as possible. Qinglan is doing his best to contribute his meager efforts. My thoughts are racing as I telegraph this, hoping for your public understanding. Zhu Qinglan bows respectfully. (18th day) Seal</p>
<p>Telegram from Rehe 2: To all newspaper offices, please note that the eastern provinces have been lost for more than a year. After invading the eastern provinces, the Japanese are planning to take over Rehe. At first, they used Mongolians as their vanguard, encroaching on Kailu. Then they relied on military force, swallowing and committing atrocities, directly invading Chaoyang. Planes come to various counties from time to time, either threatening or luring our people with words. Recently, they have been inhumanely carrying out bombings, turning cities into ruins. The number of people whose lives and property have been damaged is unknown. Fortunately, our border defense troops swore to resist aggression, and they have not succeeded. However, Rehe is poor and its resources are exhausted. Times were difficult even in peaceful times. Now, suddenly, this strange change has occurred. With a barren province, resisting enemies from the sea, land, and air for more than a year, I don't know how much effort Chairman Tang has put in to maintain it. As for today, the people have witnessed the difficulties and are unable to help. It is like a baby losing its mother, crying without a door to complain to. Now, how fortunate that President Song and Chairman Zhang descended from the sky to save our people from the brink of death. How to relieve the hunger and distress of the people, and how to boost the morale of the soldiers, President Song and Chairman Zhang must have a plan in their minds. The people do not dare to participate in or ask about the details. What we dare to rely on is only a sincere heart and the determination of the entire province to resist Japan. This is something that can be attested to by heaven and earth, blood oaths to ghosts and gods. In addition to warmly welcoming them, we humbly convey our sincerity, hoping for your understanding. All the agricultural, commercial, industrial, and academic groups, and all the people of the entire province of Rehe bow respectfully.</p>
<h3>Another Statement by the Chinese Representative to Japan (3)</h3>
<p>(The Spirit of the Treaty of Portsmouth)</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The Japanese representative has described in detail the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 over the Korean issue. The Chinese side cannot but bring to the attention of the League of Nations the memoirs written by Mutsu Munemitsu, who was the Japanese Foreign Minister at the time. Mutsu's book was not published at first, and its purpose was to defend his own policies, as there were many criticisms at the time that Mutsu had failed to prevent the joint intervention of Russia, France, and Germany after the Sino-Japanese War. The book describes in great detail Mutsu's own role in formulating and implementing Japan's conspiracy against China and its Machiavellian methods. The purpose was nothing more than to force China into a war in order to achieve Japan's policy of opening up the mainland and conquering Asia. The book is a record of one of the masterminds of the Far Eastern drama. Mutsu instructed the Japanese ambassador to Korea at the time to "use any excuse to start active operations." These are Mutsu's own words. The Japanese representative cannot have forgotten them.</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Russian agreement of 1896, the Japanese representative's declaration stated that if the Japanese government had known of the existence of this agreement at the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan would never have allowed the Manchurian problem to be delayed until today. In fact, Russia had already violated the provisions of the agreement between 1900 and 1903. China had already recognized that Russia had recognized the agreement as invalid. And when Japan declared war on Russia in 1904, China was very willing to join Japan in fighting Russia together to protect its territory. However, Japan prevented China from participating in the war. The Japanese ambassador to Beijing at the time, after receiving instructions from Tokyo, stated that "after careful consideration of this matter, the Japanese government deeply felt the need to urge China to strictly maintain neutrality." The reason for urging China to maintain neutrality, according to Japan itself, was "the consideration of international order and general interests, so that this war would be limited to Japan and Russia, and would not spread to other countries." In other words, Japan did not want Russia's European allies to have an excuse to help Russia attack Japan.</p>
<p>The Japanese declaration also stated that the fact that Manchuria was returned to the Qing Dynasty was largely due to Japan's efforts, and that China's own efforts were secondary to Japan's. Although we do not want to diminish the importance of the Russo-Japanese War, we cannot but point out that when Japan asked the United States to promote peace talks with Russia in 1905, U.S. President Roosevelt stated that the United States hoped that Japan would abide by the open-door policy in Manchuria and return the land to China. Japan agreed to this. Therefore, the Treaty of Portsmouth, which began negotiations in June 1905, was established in accordance with this meaning with regard to Manchurian land. Therefore, the question of whose efforts Manchuria was returned to is still unresolved. We should remember that the Japanese representative clearly stated in his declaration that Japan would not hesitate to seize the territory of Manchuria.</p>
<p>From another perspective, the U.S. government's note to China and Japan on January 7, 1932, stated that the U.S. government would not recognize any de facto situation, or any treaty or agreement that might harm the treaty rights of the U.S. government or its people in China. These rights include the independence of the Republic of China or the integrity of its land and administration, or the international policy of China, the so-called open-door policy. This statement by the United States shows that its current policy towards Manchuria is no different from what it declared thirty years ago. Compared with Japan's policy, there is a world of difference.</p>
<p>In its declaration, the Japanese representative also brought up the negotiations between Gao Jiyi and the Japanese representative Kimura in 1931 on the Manchurian railway issue, as evidence that Japan was striving for a peaceful solution, while China was deliberately delaying it. The facts of this case are as follows. On January 23, 1931, General Zhang Xueliang received a letter from Kimura explaining the need to discuss the pending Manchurian railway issue in order to seek a solution. On February 5 of the same year, Gao Jiyi, chairman of the Northeast Communications Committee, was entrusted to conduct negotiations with Japan. At an informal meeting on March 6, both sides agreed to appoint a number of experts to participate in the discussion. Six days later, the Chinese side had designated six experts, while Kimura had returned to Japan and notified Gao that he would not be able to come to Shenyang immediately. It was not until May 7 that the South Manchuria Railway Company notified the Chinese authorities that it had appointed six Japanese experts. And in June, Count Uchida Kosai assumed the position of president of the South Manchuria Railway in mid-July, and there was also a major change in internal personnel. Mr. Irie, one of the six Japanese experts, who had been in frequent contact with the Chinese authorities on railway issues, also lost his job as a result. After Irie left, no one filled his vacancy. All of the above is the process of the informal negotiations between China and Japan on the railway issue before the September 18th Incident.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that Japan's accusation that China deliberately delayed it is completely untrue. The reason for the delay in the negotiations was the changes in the Japanese delegation and the personnel of the South Manchuria Railway Company, and Japan's deliberate delay in appointing Japanese experts. Its lack of sincerity is obvious.</p>
<p>In his speech at the Special Assembly on December 8, the Japanese representative, regarding Japan's invasion of Chinese territory, stated that "Japan had troops stationed in Shanghai under the provisions of the treaty. Later, the Japanese government sent troops to that place. As for Manchuria, the stationing of Japanese troops in that area is also based on treaties to protect the lives and property of Japanese people." This statement by the Japanese representative is completely inconsistent with the facts and is a serious slander. The Chinese government has never recognized Japan's so-called treaty right to station troops in the South Manchuria Railway Zone, and even if there was a shadow of such a right, it had already expired in 1917. This has been stated in detail in the statement made by the Chinese representative Guo Taiqi at the Special Assembly on December 8. The stationing of Japanese troops on Chinese soil was an act of exceeding its authority even before the September 18th Incident last year. Japanese troops were never invited to our Chinese soil. As for the issue of stationing troops in Shanghai, the Japanese representative openly stated that he had the right to send troops to that place under the treaty, which has hardly been said by any other Japanese spokesperson. We should deeply remember that there is no provision in all currently effective treaties that authorizes the powers to station troops in Shanghai or can be regarded as authorizing the powers to station troops in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Japanese representative's declaration also stated that "on October 8, 1931, the eleven Japanese planes sent by Japan to Jinzhou to侦察 the Chinese army in that area were first fired upon by Chinese machine guns, and then dropped bombs and burned the Chinese army barracks in retaliation." This statement is also completely inconsistent with the facts. The Lytton Report provides a fair report on this matter on page 72. We only need to read it to know that the Chinese army did not fire or retaliate at the time. The report also stated that, in fact, the barracks were never attacked. All the many bombs fell in other parts of the city, and even hospitals and university buildings were not spared.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the withdrawal of the Chinese army to Jinzhou in October last year was inevitable after the Japanese army forcibly occupied Shenyang and other places. Since the Chinese army was forced to withdraw from Shenyang and other places, it should naturally be stationed in Jinzhou, which was the temporary seat of the Liaoning Provincial Government at the time. The simple reason why the Japanese authorities sent a squadron of bombers to Jinzhou to destroy the city was only to eliminate the last remaining administrative authority of the Chinese government in South Manchuria. The Japanese claim that the Chinese army east of the South Manchuria Railway was an obstacle to maintaining治安 is purely deceptive. The Chinese army driven to Jinzhou by the Japanese army cannot be considered threatening, and if such a theory is promoted and amplified, then any country in the world can use the excuse that there are troops stationed in a neighboring country to send troops to occupy the land. May I ask, can such an incident be allowed to exist in modern international life?</p>
<p>The Japanese declaration also stated that the seizure of customs, salt affairs bureau, post office, etc. by "Manchukuo" was a natural result of the establishment of the organization, and its behavior was entirely within the power of the government. The Lytton Report shows us that the so-called "Manchukuo" was actually manufactured by Japan, and its seizure of the above-mentioned institutions was entirely due to the instigation and assistance of Japanese civil and military authorities. As for the Japanese's implementation of seizing various public service institutions, tax revenues, properties, and archives of the Chinese government in Manchuria, and even the methods of arresting, imprisoning, threatening, and intimidating to achieve their goals, a review of Documents Nos. 23, 25, 27, and 28 of the Chinese representative to the investigation team will reveal the details.</p>
<p>The investigation team's report has confirmed that the entire process of creating and establishing the so-called "Manchukuo" was entirely in the hands of Japanese civil and military authorities. At the Special Assembly meeting on December 6, the Japanese representative still argued that the movement was entirely out of the initiative of Manchurian Chinese leaders, which is completely inconsistent with the established facts and need not be refuted. The Japanese representative had previously sent many copies of telegrams to the Secretariat for forwarding to international members for publicity. These telegrams were allegedly sent to the League of Nations by "various public organizations in Manchuria" to prove that the establishment of "Manchukuo" had gained the full support of the majority of the local people. Regarding this incident, the Chinese representative had previously asked the League of Nations to pay attention to the fact that Japanese personnel in Japan often fabricated evidence to prove that "Manchukuo" was indeed loved by the local people. These evidences are all untrue, and please do not be deceived by the League of Nations. The Chinese delegation asked the Secretariat to submit a telegram to the members on November 19. The telegram was sent by General Su Bingwen from northern Manchuria, stating</p>
<p>"The Japanese authorities claim that the Lytton Report states that the so-called "Manchukuo" does not represent the will of the local people, so they have sent representatives to Heilongjiang Province to force local Chinese groups to sign a statement endorsing "Manchukuo." This matter is currently being handled by the so-called Governor of Heilongjiang Province. Similar illegal counterfeiting methods are also being used in Jilin and Liaoning provinces. All the forged documents will be sent to Geneva to deceive the League of Nations authorities."</p>
<p>Generals Su and Zhang also had a telegram that was forwarded to the League of Nations by the Chinese delegation, stating</p>
<p>"Recently, Japan has forced local residents to declare their loyalty to the puppet organization, and instructed county magistrates in various places to express their support for the puppet organization by forging submissions to the puppet organization. Please forward this to the League of Nations."</p>
<p>On September 22 of this year, General Ma Zhanshan sent a telegram from Heilongjiang to the National Government, reporting that local Japanese soldiers had issued an order that, from August 1, the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of all counties in Heilongjiang Province should personally go to various villages and towns to force people to sign pledges of allegiance to "Manchukuo" and give speeches everywhere, promoting the benefits of cooperation between "Manchukuo" and Japan.</p>
<p>All of the above is the method by which Japan obtained the "free" and "natural will" of the people of the Asian continent to endorse "Manchukuo" in order to dispel the League of Nations' doubts. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression Headquarters Orders Three Provinces to Compile and Investigate Baojia Household Registration</h3>
<p>Formulate General Mobilization Measures for All Officials and People</p>
<p>To Establish the Foundation for Self-Defense and the Effect of Lasting Peace</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui regards the compilation of Baojia and the investigation of household registration as important tasks for bandit suppression. It previously formulated regulations and issued them to the governments of the three provinces to implement. Now, in view of the fact that the compilation and investigation affairs are extremely difficult and complicated, and there is concern that there may be perfunctory and deceptive practices, seven articles of the General Mobilization Measures for Compiling and Investigating Baojia Household Registration have been formulated and promulgated, and the governments of the three provinces are notified to pass them on to the counties to follow, using the original order and its measures as follows: 1. Notice: "The compilation and investigation of Baojia household registration is a current and essential government affair. We have repeatedly ordered that it be handled within the time limit. All compilation and investigation progress has been reported to the headquarters one after another. Those counties that have failed to complete it within the time limit should step up their efforts. Those counties that have completed it and reported on it, whether it is practical or not, whether there are perfunctory or deceptive practices, etc. If it is found that they are perfunctory, then the compilation and investigation is equivalent to a mere formality, what is the point? However, the compilation and investigation affairs are extremely difficult and complicated. Relying solely on the compilation and investigation personnel assigned by the counties to be responsible for handling them, it is difficult to oversee and their energy is not enough. If more personnel are assigned, there are difficulties in terms of funding and personnel selection, and it is difficult to handle in practice. To achieve the goal of speed and accuracy, and to complete the mission of self-defense, the only way is to have the cooperation of officials and people in a general mobilization to engage in compilation and investigation. The county orders the assigned compilation and investigation personnel to preside over and instruct. The number of people is larger, and it is easier to gather things together. Moreover, having local people engage in compilation and investigation, their knowledge is more true and the situation is more familiar, and the evils of deception and concealment can be avoided. Take this opportunity to explain the Baojia regulations and their essentials to the general public in detail, so that they are all aware of the importance of the Baojia relationship, in order to eliminate unconscious surprise and suspicion. Outstanding people from all localities should take on the responsibility of pre-guidance, and they will be able to enthusiastically take on the task and handle it effectively, establishing the foundation for self-defense and the effect of lasting peace. It is appropriate to check and issue a copy of the General Mobilization Measures for Compiling and Investigating Baojia Household Registration, and order you to immediately transfer and comply with this order." 2. Measures: 1. When compiling and investigating Baojia household registration, the following personnel in the local area should be mobilized to go out in full force: A. Staff members of various agencies; B. Chief of the Public Security Bureau and police; C. Those in the team officers and soldiers who are literate; D. Personnel of various people's organizations; E. Teachers and staff of various schools, private school teachers, and senior students; F. Those among the residents who are literate. 2. Before the mobilization, the meaning of compiling and investigating Baojia household registration and the general compilation and investigation methods, as well as the matters that should be paid attention to, should be explained in detail, so that they are thoroughly understood, and then they should be divided into groups and sections to go to the designated areas to undertake the compilation and investigation. 3.

<h3>Three Provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui Request Additional Import Tax on Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>He Jian's Proposal After Failing to Promote Hunan Rice</p>
<p>Dumping of Foreign Rice is Enough to Lower Domestic Grain Prices and Harm Farmers</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province had a bumper harvest last year, and the price of rice was the lowest in the past five or six years. The average price of rice was around five yuan, and the best machine rice was only sold for six yuan and eight jiao per stone. Moreover, the stone in Changsha is eight liters more than the stone in Hankou (i.e., one hundred and eight liters). Low grain prices hurt farmers, and the rural economy is bankrupt, resulting in a shortage of income for the provincial government. In order to promote the sale of grain and raise rice prices, He Jian established the Hunan Grain Transportation and Sales Committee, and the Provincial Bank issued an additional 1.5 million yuan in standard currency as a fund for transporting and selling grain, which was jointly responsible by officials and merchants to purchase grain and transport it to Shanghai and Hankou, in order to circulate the surplus grain in Hunan Province and invigorate finance. At the same time, Ling Ruigong, a member of the Construction Special Committee, was sent to Guangdong and Hong Kong to negotiate the promotion of Hunan rice. As a result, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places were all flooded with foreign rice, so Hunan rice could not be promoted. In particular, the move to transport and sell Hunan rice to Guangdong was fundamentally unfeasible. Due to the inconvenient transportation between Hunan and Guangdong, the time it takes to handle one shipment of Hunan rice can handle more than three shipments of foreign rice. Therefore, the profits from handling foreign rice are more favorable than those from Hunan rice. Therefore, Guangdong merchants did not purchase Hunan rice, and Hunan grain had no way out, and the national economy and people's livelihood suffered. Tracing back to the origin, it was caused by the dumping of foreign rice. In early February, He Jian sent a telegram to the governments of Jiangxi and Anhui provinces, which are known for their abundant rice production, requesting them to jointly consult the Ministry of Finance to implement additional import taxes on foreign rice in order to resist it. Xiong Shihui, chairman of Jiangxi, and Wu Zhongxin, chairman of Anhui, both replied in support and asked Hunan Province to draft the document. The Hunan Provincial Government then drafted the document and consulted the Ministry of Finance jointly with He Jian, Xiong Shihui, and Wu Zhongxin, requesting the Ministry of Finance to promptly order the customs to implement it. The consultation document stated, "The Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces along the Yangtze River have always been rice-producing areas. In years of average harvests, in addition to storing rice for the local people, the annual amount of rice transported out is about 10 million shi, which benefits both farmers and merchants. The autumn harvest last year was still considered to be abundant, but the price of rice was low, and compared with the flood disaster in the previous year, the ratio was almost ten to one. The rural economy has suffered a great loss, and there is a risk of bankruptcy. Although there are many reasons for this, the main reason is that foreign rice from Annam is imported from Shanghai and sold in large quantities in the provinces along the Yangtze River, making it impossible for domestic rice to be transported out, resulting in the current situation of low grain prices harming farmers. If we do not urgently resist it, not only will our profits be lost, affecting the economy, but also the surplus of domestic rice will cause distress to farmers and merchants, which is detrimental to both the national economy and the people's livelihood. Our provincial governments have considered the situation and must do their best to save the situation. After repeated consultations, we have reached the same opinion. Therefore, we have specially prepared this document together, consulting your ministry to investigate and order the customs in all locations to immediately impose additional import taxes on foreign rice imports in order to resist them, and we hope that you will reply with the amount of tax to be added per stone of rice. This is a matter of public interest." (February 17)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Circles Donate Money and Goods to Save the Country</h3>
<p>(Items are transported to the front lines in succession for慰問)</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the Yu關 Incident, our officers and soldiers have fought bravely and shed blood to resist the enemy. People from all over the country share the same hatred and donate money and goods to relieve the national crisis. Various circles in Qingdao have also initiated the establishment of the Northeast Relief Monthly Donation Association and the Disaster Area Goods Emergency Relief Association. Various schools have also conducted 慰問 activities. For a time, the patriotic movement has sprung up. The following is a record of the fundraising situation of various patriotic groups:</p>
<p>(Relief Monthly Donation Association)</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Relief Northeast Refugee Monthly Donation Association, there have been more than 1,600 basic members, with monthly donations of about 2,000 yuan. Recently, in order to be more universal, the association has sent letters to leaders of various agencies, groups, and schools, inviting them to join the association. It is reported that it has received letters from various places, unanimously agreeing to join. The donation results will definitely be more impressive in the future.</p>
<p>(Goods Emergency Relief Association)</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Disaster Area Goods Emergency Relief Association, people from all walks of life have actively donated goods to help the disaster relief efforts. A few days ago, the association sent members in twelve groups to solicit donations. On the way, they met a poor old woman over seventy years old who, unable to donate money, took off her棉襖 and donated it generously without any reluctance. Also, a child named Huang Yuting, only eight years old, donated two yuan, asking it to be used to buy a救國 plane. Statistics show that more than 3,000 items have been obtained, and more than 1,000 yuan in cash. Donations are still being collected continuously. Once a certain amount has been accumulated, members will be sent to the front lines to provide relief.</p>
<p>(Making慰勞 Bags)</p>
<p>The Youth Association's少年 Department recently promoted the purchase and production of慰勞 bags. All primary and secondary schools inside and outside the city responded enthusiastically. The Chemistry Department of Shandong University manufactured the fastest, having already made 1,000 bags, which were delivered to the Goods Emergency Relief Association. Chongde Middle School has also made more than 100 bags. Other schools, such as Lixian Middle School, Wende Girls' Middle School, and Municipal Middle School, are also rushing to make them. It is expected that they will be completed within this week. Primary schools, such as Huangtai Road Primary School, Beiping Road Primary School, Taidong Town Primary School, Taixi Town Primary School, Shunxing Road Primary School, and Experimental Primary School, are also rushing to manufacture them day and night. Once they are made, they will be handed over to the Goods Emergency Relief Association for forwarding to the front lines to show 慰勞.</p>
<p>(慰勞 Soldiers Association)</p>
<p>Before the end of the winter vacation, students of the Municipal Girls' Middle School organized a committee to慰勞 soldiers on the front lines. They also took advantage of the winter vacation to solicit donations from all walks of life, raising more than 1,000 yuan in total. They then purchased appropriate items and, with the help of students, made 36 cotton coats, 204 cotton vests, 200 undershirts, 1,200 pairs of socks, 432 towels, 240 pairs of shoes, and 1,200 pairs of gloves. They have been delivered to the Goods Emergency Relief Association in two batches for transportation to the front lines to慰勞 the loyal and brave soldiers in the snow. (February 17)</p>

<h3>Industrial Branch Holds Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Branch of the中華 Industrial General Federation, initiated by factories in Wuxian County, has been fully prepared and filed with the General Federation for record. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday (the 19th) at 2 p.m. in Nan Dingjia Lane. The General Federation sent Qian Chengxu to Suzhou to oversee the meeting.</p>
<h3>Officials and Gentry Jointly Form Construction Committee</h3>

<h3>Difficulty in Using New Measuring Instruments for Rice and Bean Trade</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of various industries switching to the new system of weights and measures, the weights and measures inspectors have recently been actively supervising. Most industries have complied with the order to switch to new instruments. However, the rice and bean trade has not yet switched to new measuring instruments. According to the rice and bean trade, the measuring instruments vary in different places. In the Wuxi area, the 糟斛 is used, with each stone weighing 140 catties. In Beijing and Shanghai, the海斛 is used, with each stone weighing 160 catties. Suzhou, on the other hand, is smaller than Wuxi. Currently, the rice and bean trade in Wuxi has repeatedly convened executive and supervisory meetings to discuss the switch to new instruments. It is generally agreed that the switch to new instruments would require about 30,000 yuan in expenses, which is difficult to raise in the current economic downturn. Moreover, the old instruments used in the rice and bean trade are old and lack the ability to contract. If new instruments are used, the wood will inevitably contract if exposed to sunlight, increasing the capacity. If exposed to陰雨, the capacity can also decrease, resulting in unevenness. Therefore, it is considered difficult to switch for the time being. However, the county government has now sent members to the Be平 Weights and Measures Manufacturing Factory to purchase two standard 斛 for transportation to Wuxi for accurate measurement. As for the mountain goods trade, the衡器 used has not yet been switched to new instruments. Therefore, inspectors Tang Fuquan and others have scheduled to convene representatives of various mountain goods stores in urban and rural areas on the 12th day of the old calendar at the county government to talk, setting a deadline for the switch and prohibiting陽奉陰違. The silk and cloth trade, clothing trade, etc., have also switched to the new尺.</p>

Mei Zhezhi, the director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry, and his wife, along with Chen Bingquan, the director of the Statistics Department, Secretary Tang, and Section Chief Chen, and others, a group of seven or eight people, arrived in Wuxi around 3 p.m. on the afternoon before (the 18th) and stayed at the New World Hotel. After Chen Gongbo arrived in Wuxi, he also went to the hotel to rest. Around 9 a.m. yesterday, he was invited by Gu Yufang and Gu Mingjiu, the Wuxi locals and specialists from the Ministry of Industry, to take a car to visit scenic spots such as Taihu Lake, Meiyuan, and Xiaojishan. It is heard that Chen Gongbo is scheduled to leave Wuxi around 6 p.m. to return to Beijing.</p>

<h3>Joint Declaration by Ma Xiangbo and Zhang Taiyan</h3>
<p>Japanese Should Withdraw Outside Korea</p>
<p>Rehe is Not Part of Manchuria</p>
<p>After the violent Japanese forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces, they falsely claimed to the international community that Manchuria and Mongolia were not Chinese territories. Scholars and giants Ma Xiangbo and Zhang Taiyan had previously issued a declaration, refuting this based on historical facts. Now that the Japanese are invading Rehe, they are again falsely claiming that Rehe is part of Manchuria. Ma Xiangbo and Zhang Taiyan yesterday jointly issued a declaration, proving based on historical facts that Rehe has nothing to do with Manchuria, and that Korea is a descendant of Jizi of our country. The Japanese lifeline should not extend to Rehe, and they should withdraw from Korea. The declaration will be telegraphed to Geneva to be announced to the world. The original text is recorded as follows: The Japanese regard our three northeastern provinces as their lifeline. The Chinese say, "This line is of a rubber nature, it is elastic, please see below." It is easier to understand that Rehe should not be a part of Manchuria than the three northeastern provinces. Rehe was originally the territory of the three Wei of Duoyan during the Ming Dynasty. The Duoyan species are the ancient Shanrong, the島桓 of the Han Dynasty, and the奚 of the Tang Dynasty, which are very close to the Khitan species, and far from the Manchurian species. Later, when the Qing people seized the land, it was not the old residence of the Manchus. As of today, there are nearly four million Han people in Rehe, and no Manchus. It cannot be said that Rehe should be owned by the Manchus. If it is said that it was once seized by the Manchus and is a part of Manchuria, then why not return Sakhalin (Chinese name Kuye) in the north and Taiwan in the south, which were not seized by the Manchus, to the Manchurian puppet government? The Japanese also claimed that Tang Yulin had signed the Manchurian declaration. Whether it is true or false cannot be proven. Even if there is, it can only be called a personal private agreement. How can the Chinese government and the Chinese people recognize it? This is even more unworthy of laughter. The world recognizes that Korea is a descendant of Jizi, born and raised there, with history. Recently, Korean patriots have expressed their demands to the League of Nations, demanding the restoration of their old things. Therefore, it can be asserted that the aforementioned rubber line should not only not extend to our Rehe, but according to public opinion, should withdraw outside of Korea. Please, those who support humanity, strive for public opinion. January 18, 22nd year, declaration by Ma Xiangbo and Zhang Taiyan.</p>
<h3>Tang Youren Discusses the Recent Situation in North China</h3>
<p>President Song's Visit to Rehe Greatly Boosts Morale</p>
<p>Japan Withdraws from League of Nations, Internal Opinions Differ</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, Tang Youren, the secretary-general of the Central Political Conference, was interviewed at his residence yesterday to ask about the recent situation in North China, etc. According to the discussion, it is as follows:</p>
<h3>The Beginning and End of Song's Trip to the North</h3>
<p>According to Tang, after the international situation changed, Japan, realizing its own disadvantage, and based on its 野幹 ambition, invaded Rehe in order to realize its dream of swallowing the four northeastern provinces. Therefore, the situation in North China has become increasingly tense in recent days. Our army's preparations for resisting the enemy have long been actively deployed. According to reports from those who have come south from North China, the situation in North China is urgent, and the morale cannot be boosted without a senior central official going north to take charge. Chairman Jiang was suppressing the communists in Jiangxi and could not spare time, so he specially sent President Song to the north. After Song arrived in Beiping, he discussed and planned all important matters such as finance and military affairs in North China with Zhang Xueliang, etc., and decided on specific measures. Therefore, the morale in North China has been greatly boosted, and the people have been inspired, which is completely different from the past. Song also considered Rehe to be an important border area, so he specially accompanied Zhang, etc. to inspect in person, encouraging the morale of the front lines. As for Song's return to Beijing on the 4th, it cannot be confirmed at this time.</p>
<h3>Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the Japanese side has been touting it for a long time. According to the situation in Japan, its military and fascist proponents are firmly advocating withdrawal, while diplomatic personnel are advocating caution, and opinions have not yet been unified. The League of Nations, for the sake of its own prestige, should further adopt Article 16, economic sanctions, because Japan's invasion of our country violates all international conventions and is enough to shake world peace. The report of the League of Nations Special Committee has already been published. The report is completely based on the Lytton Report, and the judgment on the facts is still fair, Tang said. Tang continued that diplomacy should be based on military affairs, etc.</p>

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Returns to Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Southwest Provinces' Attitude Towards Resistance Against Japan and Suppression of Bandits is Completely Consistent with the Central Government</p>
<p>Huang Will Return to Beijing in a Few Days and Plans to Visit Jiangxi</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Huang Shaoxiong, the Minister of the Interior, was ordered by the Central Government to go to Guangzhou on the 17th of last month to meet with Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, Cai Tingkai, and others to discuss the issue of resisting Japan and suppressing bandits. He arrived in Shanghai on the Russian Empress liner of the昌奥 Company from Hong Kong at 9:30 yesterday morning and immediately took a car back to his residence to rest. A Central News Agency reporter visited Minister Huang at his residence yesterday to inquire about the results of the trip. He was granted an interview and answered in detail as follows:</p>
<h3>Satisfactory Results of This Trip</h3>
<p>According to Minister Huang, resisting Japan and suppressing bandits were originally the consistent goals of the Central Government and the Southwest. His trip to Guangdong was only to discuss the various difficult issues related to resisting Japan and suppressing bandits, such as economic issues, etc. During his stay in Guangdong, he consulted with various leaders in the Southwest several times and reached satisfactory results on the difficult points. The three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian have now decided to transfer some troops to Jiangxi to剿 共 bandits. As for the establishment of the Southwest National Defense Committee, it focuses on the construction of national defense in the Southwest provinces and economic cooperation and preparation, and has no other military significance.</p>
<h3>Attitude of Li and Hu</h3>
<p>Huang continued, during his stay in Hong Kong, he met with Mr. Li Renchao. Mr. Li's health has recovered slightly compared to when he was in Shanghai. According to Mr. Li, he will return to his hometown in Guangxi soon. Once his health has recovered, he will go to Beijing to cancel his leave. He also met with Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong. Mr. Hu's views on resisting Japan and suppressing bandits are also consistent with the Central Government, but Mr. Hu has no intention of going north at present. As for Mr. Xiao Focheng, who recently returned from Siam, although he met with him in Hong Kong, he did not have a long conversation.</p>
<h3>Will Report to Beijing in a Few Days</h3>
<p>Huang concluded that his trip to Guangdong made him feel that the progress of construction in Guangdong in recent years has been very rapid, and the atmosphere of resisting Japan is also very tense. He originally planned to visit Guangxi, but because of the haste of time, and he had already met with Bai Jiansheng and others in Guangdong, he temporarily gave up. The truth about Guizhou is not very clear. He is scheduled to return to Beijing in a day or two to report and will visit Jiangxi to pay his respects to Chairman Jiang.</p>
<h3>Declaration of All Shanghai News Reporters on the Case of the Illegal Execution of Liu Yusheng</h3>
<p>Declaration of All Shanghai News Reporters</p>
<p>Patriotic Writing is Referred to as Inciting Red Terror</p>
<p>Writing Describing Political Darkness, and Chaos and Displacement</p>
<p>Even in Despotic Times was Regarded as a Classic that Scholars Must Read</p>
<p>Detention Beyond Time, Abuse of Military Law, Constitution Being Trampled</p>
<p>Niu Lan and Chen Duxiu Were Still Tried by Judicial Organs</p>
<p>After Liu Yusheng, the manager and editor of the Zhenjiang Jiangsheng Daily, was illegally executed by Gu Zhutong, all circles rose up in opposition and were extremely indignant. The Shanghai News Reporters Association sent members to Zhenjiang to investigate the truth and, based on the facts, requested the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government to remove Gu from office and bring him to justice. The Supervisory Yuan continued to impeach him, as reported in the previous newspaper. Last week, the association drafted a declaration listing twelve points of Gu Zhutong's illegal execution of Liu Yusheng. The declaration was signed by 239 reporters from all Shanghai newspapers and published yesterday. The original text is recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Shanghai News Reporters' Joint Declaration on the Liu Case</h3>
<p>Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has unjustly killed Liu Yusheng, manager and editor of the Jiangsheng Daily in Zhenjiang. The Shanghai News Reporters Association has already issued a declaration expressing its serious protest. Now, based on the materials collected by colleagues, and with a calm attitude, we make a purely rational statement on this case, to make it clear that Gu Zhutong's unjust killing of Liu Yusheng cannot escape responsibility in fact or in law. We hope that people from all walks of life will carefully examine it.</p>
<p>(1) In terms of facts, when Gu Zhutong reported on the shooting of Liu Yusheng at the memorial week for the Prime Minister held by the Jiangsu Provincial Government on January 23, he only stated that Liu Yusheng was the manager and editor of the Jiangsheng Daily, and that he used the supplement "Bian Sheng" to promote communism and incite class struggle. The articles he wrote, such as "Dang," "Xia Si Xu Zhi," "Bian Sheng," "Our Hope," "The Era Is Not the Era," and "Dragon Boat Festival," etc., were full of reactionary meaning, but he failed to cite any reactionary words. As for the Jiangsu Provincial Government's reply to the Executive Yuan on January 31, it pointed out that "verified by the Tie Li supplement, there are sentences such as 'Our motherland's soldiers are retreating to the left, and naturally the enemy is faintly coming up on the right; a red tide is rising on the ground; and the era has swept up a violent wave, and everything old will be overturned immediately; the era has struck a death knell, and everything old will be buried before our eyes; slaves, fight!' and so on, which are said to be 'deliberately inciting class struggle and instigating red terror, which is really undisguised,'" etc. If Liu Yusheng's guilt were like this, we would never protect him. However, after checking the original text published in the Tie Li supplement, not only is the meaning of the words completely different from what Gu Zhutong pointed out, but the text has also been arbitrarily altered. The act of taking out of context and fabricating charges is obvious at a glance. This is the first point that should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(2) The six articles published in the Tie Li supplement, "Dang," "Xia Si Xu Zhi," "Bian Sheng," "Our Hope," "The Era Is Not the Era," and "Dragon Boat Festival," were published on six different days. The sentence "Our motherland's soldiers are retreating to the left, and naturally the enemy is faintly coming up on the right; a red tide is rising on the ground," which Gu Zhutong described in his reply to the Executive Yuan, is found in the "Bian Sheng" article. One section of the original text reads, "A team of our motherland's soldiers is retreating to the left, and naturally the enemy is faintly coming up on the right; Japanese soldiers are pursuing; the national flag of blue sky, white sun, and red earth is tilted on the earth fort, and a big flag of white day and red sun is erected upright." Another section writes, "In the rumbling sound of gunfire and artillery, the soldiers on the earth fort are gradually becoming fewer and fewer, and finally they fall dead around the national flag, falling dead in a pool of blood. The national flag snatched back from the pool of blood still accompanies them and falls in a snowfield of red tide." This section purely depicts the heroic situation of the national army defending the fort and vowing to resist the enemy. The so-called motherland is the Republic of China represented by the blue sky, white sun, and red earth, the so-called enemy is the Japanese soldiers represented by the white day and red sun, and the so-called red tide is the blood of the soldiers defending the fort. Gu Zhutong, however, used the words "red tide" to accuse it of inciting red terror and extracted fragments of it to support his argument. How can we not call it an unjust killing? This is the second point that should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(3) In Gu Zhutong's reply to the Executive Yuan, he pointed out the sentence "The era has swept up a violent wave, and everything old will be overturned immediately; the era has struck a death knell, and everything old will be buried before our eyes; slaves, fight!" as inciting class struggle. After checking, it is found in the "Xia Si Xu Zhi" article in the "Tie Li" supplement. This article describes the unfairness of service, labor, and remuneration between superiors and subordinates in society. The superiors it refers to are those who "gain without labor," and the subordinates it refers to are those who "labor without gain." Under a revolutionary government, there should be no superiors who gain without labor, nor should there be subordinates who labor without gain. If there are, then it is just as the Prime Minister said, "The revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades still need to work hard" to achieve a situation where both superiors and subordinates should gain from their labor. If this is referred to as inciting class struggle, then even under an autocratic regime, when the hierarchy between ruler and subject was strict, Mencius still had the saying, "If the ruler regards his subjects as grass, then the subjects will regard the ruler as bandits." "I have heard of the execution of a single man Zhou, but I have not heard of the killing of a ruler." Comparing the past with the present, we cannot help but feel emotional. This is the third point that should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(4) As for the "Dang" article published in the Tie Li supplement, it describes the suffering of laborers; "The Era Is Not the Era" describes the bankruptcy of the countryside; "Dragon Boat Festival" is a seasonal travelogue; "Our Hope" is an introductory text in the Tie Li supplement for letters and submissions. These six articles were written by five authors with names such as "Yu Shi," "Chang Pu," "Ju Zi," "Bai Di," and "Editor." Every word and sentence in these articles does not incite class struggle or instigate red terror. This type of writing is often published by newspaper groups in various provinces and regions. It can even be found in ancient scriptures and biographies. The Book of Songs' "Jie Nan Shan," "Zheng Yue," "Shi Yue Zhi Lai," "Yu Wu Zhi," "Zhan Yang," and several other poems describe the darkness of the secret political situation at the time. "Da Dong," "Ge Lü," "Fa Tan," "Zheng Yue," and several other poems describe the inequality between the rich and poor classes at the time. "Hu Yu," "Cai Wei," "He Cao Bu Huang," "Tu Yuan," and "Tiao Zhi Hua" and other poems depict the pain and misery of death, chaos, displacement, and loss. Compared with what is published in the Tie Li supplement, it is even more excessive. In the autocratic era, they were still regarded as classics and were required reading for those who governed the country. The hardships of the people are exactly what the authorities should widely investigate and understand. Yet now Liu Yusheng has lost his life because of this. This is the fourth point that should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(5) We are willing to make a further argument. Some may think that we, as colleagues in the same industry, believe that what is published in Tie Li does not have an inciting meaning because we are being partial. However, after Liu Yusheng was arrested, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department decided at a meeting on July 28 to send a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government approving the resumption of publication of the Jiangsheng Daily and releasing Liu Yusheng on bail. This shows that the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department believes that what is published in Tie Li does not have any reactionary suspicions. Supervisory Committee members Liu Eqing and Tian Jiongjin of the Control Yuan impeached Gu Zhutong's original case, saying that the novels were merely works depicting the social life of our country. The case was reviewed and passed by Supervisory Committee members Zhou Lisheng, Gao Yihan, and Li Menggeng, and the Control Yuan submitted a request to the National Government to hand Gu Zhutong over for disciplinary action. This shows that the Control Yuan believes that what is published in Tie Li does not have any reactionary suspicions. Under a system of governing the country through party rule, the provincial government brazenly disregarded the resolution of the provincial party department. Under the exercise of the five-power system, the provincial government dared to ignore the impeachment and investigation of the highest supervisory body. Not only did they not transfer Liu Yusheng to the court, but they even proposed shooting him. We do not know how Gu Zhutong's authority as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government is so great. This should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(6) Let's assume that what was published in the Tie Li supplement had inappropriate content, leading to the arrest by military authorities. However, when Liu Yusheng was in prison, he submitted a plea to the provincial government, expressing his remorse and pleading for a different place of detention so that he could study and make amends. Every word in the original plea was filled with tears and was unbearable to read. Anyone with a heart would feel pity. (The original plea is presented separately below.) According to Article 6 of the Regulations for the Implementation of the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China, promulgated by the National Government Decree on March 9, 1931, the provisions of the Rehabilitation Institute Regulations still apply to crimes under the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China. Even if Liu Yusheng had committed a crime of endangering the Republic of China, why was he not given a place for reflection and repentance? This should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(7) The above is based on facts. Now, let's discuss it from a legal perspective. Article 8 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the Period of Political Tutelage, passed by the National Assembly on May 12, 1931, and promulgated by the National Government on June 1, 1931, stipulates that when people are arrested or detained on suspicion of a crime, the agency executing the arrest or detention must transfer them to a judicial organ for interrogation within 14 hours. Liu Yusheng was arrested by the Zhenjiang Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau's Detective Team while visiting Helin Temple at 1 PM on July 26, 1932. According to the law, he should have been transferred to a judicial organ before 12 AM on July 27, 1932. However, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau delayed the transfer to the Martial Law Headquarters, which it considered to be a judicial organ, until July 30. The agency executing the arrest detained him for three 24-hour periods. This should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(8) Article 9 of the Provisional Constitution stipulates that people, except for active military personnel, shall not be subject to military trial unless in accordance with the law. Liu Yusheng was not an active military personnel. Why should he be subject to trial by a military organ? Some may say that Article 7 of the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China stipulates that those who commit the crimes stipulated in this law shall be tried by the highest military organ in the martial law area. However, Article 84 of the Provisional Constitution clearly stipulates that all laws that conflict with this Provisional Constitution are invalid. Therefore, the transfer of Liu Yusheng to the Martial Law Headquarters for trial was clearly inappropriate. This should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(9) On July 26, the Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered the Provincial Public Security Bureau to order the Jiangsheng Daily to cease publication for violating Articles 19(1) and (2) of the Publication Law and ordered the bureau to summon Liu Yusheng, the manager of the newspaper, to the government for investigation. Article 23 of the Publication Law stipulates that if the Ministry of Interior believes that a publication contains any of the matters listed in Article 19, it may specify the matter and prohibit the sale and distribution of the publication and may seize it when necessary. The attached provision stipulates that if the circumstances are minor, the Ministry of Interior may correct or warn it. The authority to execute the punishment for violating the Publication Law lies with the Ministry of Interior. The legal regulations are very clear. How could the Jiangsu Provincial Government order the Provincial Public Security Bureau to close the newspaper and detain the manager? Gu Zhutong's illegal arrest and exceeding his authority are undeniable. This should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(10) Gu Zhutong secretly ordered the Provincial Public Security Bureau to close the Jiangsheng Daily and summon Liu Yusheng based on the Publication Law. He then arrested Liu Yusheng and transferred him to the Martial Law Headquarters for interrogation for six months based on the Jiangsu Provincial Capital Martial Law Regulations. Finally, he sentenced him to death based on the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China. As the Control Yuan's impeachment document states, "The cited regulations are inconsistent and clearly have ulterior motives and intend to frame him." However, Gu Zhutong replied to the Executive Yuan, saying that the Publication Law was applied to control the newspaper and the Martial Law Regulations were applied to try the criminal, and that the laws had their own basis. We do not understand why, since he could apply the Publication Law to punish the newspaper, he could not apply Chapter 6 of the Publication Law to punish the publisher and editor. Some may say that a special law takes precedence over a general law. The Criminal Law is a general law, and the Publication Law is a special law. Since Liu Yusheng was the manager and editor of the newspaper, it would be most appropriate to use the Publication Law to punish him. Why did Gu Zhutong insist on handling the case based on the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China and arbitrarily cite it for comparison? This should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(11) Gu Zhutong's reply to the Executive Yuan, stating that the Control Yuan's criticism based on general legal principles and peacetime conditions was inconsistent with the situation in Jiangsu Province after the January 28 Incident, was even more alarmist. The January 28 Incident ended in March. Liu Yusheng was arrested on July 26, four months later. At that time, the security of Jiangsu Province had long been completely restored and there was no emergency to speak of. As for the Chen Duxiu and Niu Lanshan cases, which have recently received widespread attention from the people of the country, the arrest location was Shanghai, where the January 28 Incident occurred, and the circumstances were ten to a hundred times worse than Liu Yusheng's. However, they were both transferred to the court and subjected to legal trial by the judicial organs. Why was Liu Yusheng treated so harshly? If it is said that the Sino-Japanese problem is not resolved for a day, then the state of preparedness cannot be relaxed for a day, then this should be said externally, and cannot be used as an excuse to internally destroy human rights. Moreover, in the future, there will be long-term resistance, lasting for ten or dozens of years. If what Gu Zhutong said is true, then the people of the whole country will be permanently under the control of military organs and will not be able to enjoy the freedom of speech and the guarantee of personal safety and human rights granted by the Provisional Constitution. This is not a problem for Liu Yusheng alone, but something that all the people should seriously protest. This should be noted by all sectors.</p>
<p>(12) Gu Zhutong's reply to the Executive Yuan also stated that Liu Yusheng had formed an illegal labor union with communist elements in March 1927 and incited rickshaw pullers to strike, which was handled by the Political Department of the Second Division of the 17th Army of the National Revolutionary Army. This is even more inconsistent with the facts. Liu Yusheng was arrested for organizing a labor union and opposing the Communist Party. After the purge of the Communist Party, Du Qiyun, the deputy commander of the 17th Army, released him and entrusted him with a position as a counselor. The facts are exactly the opposite of what Gu Zhutong cited. Turning white into black shows his intentions. In short, in the case of Gu Zhutong's unjust killing of Liu Yusheng, in terms of facts, he took out of context and turned black and white upside down. In terms of law, he was inconsistent, violated the law, and exceeded his authority. Under the rule of the party and the implementation of the five-power system, he dared to disregard the resolutions of the highest party department in Jiangsu Province and reject the investigation of the highest supervisory body of the National Government, acting arbitrarily and putting people to death. What kind of world is this that has such an unjust case? We are employed in the news industry and are all Chinese citizens. We have read the National Government's clear orders to protect human rights and the Chinese Kuomintang National Congress's proposal to support the news industry. We firmly believe that upholding the rule of law and rectifying discipline are the greatest determination and responsibility of the central party department and the National Government. Therefore, Gu Zhutong, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, who destroys the law, disrupts discipline, and destroys human rights, must be subject to the sanctions of national law, and Liu Yusheng, the manager and editor of the Jiangsheng Daily, must be finally vindicated. This is what we dare to assert. We hereby issue this joint declaration, hoping that all national agencies, organizations, colleagues in the press, and compatriots from all walks of life will jointly supervise it.

<h3>Municipal Federation Agrees Not to Pay Water Bills</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that the Shanghai Special District Municipal Federation, in support of not paying water bills, wrote to the Shanghai Real Estate Association yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, the water case is of utmost concern to all citizens. Water is an indispensable part of human life. Without it, there is death, and there is no substitute for it. Therefore, expensive water bills will inevitably have a significant impact on the social economy. However, the right to pay water bills is not entirely in the hands of the citizens, so there is 'a heart to resist, but no power to implement.' Since the water company continued to cut off the water supply, the citizens were willing to risk the danger of being deprived of drinking water and cooking, risking their lives, solely for the sake of protecting the future interests of all citizens. It is not that there is no way to temporarily sacrifice others to save the current situation. Some people think that even if all the citizens rise up and fight in the water case, the sons of wealthy families will not leave their homes. Their personal interests are too deep and their concern for the public interest is too weak. Their unity will not be strong and their actions will not be thorough. Why don't we temporarily stand by and wait and see what happens? We recently read the emergency notice on your association's report, resolving to implement 'all water bills will be temporarily withheld until the water company resumes supplying water and sincerely seeks a legal and reasonable solution.' Such a passionate and heroic act is truly what is meant by 'not crying out until the time is right, and then startling the world with a single cry.' We are extremely impressed. In addition to writing to the Chinese taxpayers in the Shanghai Concession, we are also writing to you, hoping that you will persevere to the end and not surrender, and not withdraw your defenses. All citizens are willing to be your support." To the Shanghai Real Estate Association.</p>
<h3>Water Supply Cut Off Again in Shuncheng Lane, Yangshupu</h3>
<p>Shuncheng Lane, Yangshupu Road in this city, has more than 230 houses, managed by the real estate department of the Huada Foreign Firm. There are approximately 400 to 500 tenant households. Previously, the monthly water bill for each house was 1.9 yuan. After the installation of water meters, the monthly water bill is 13.5 yuan. Therefore, they refused to pay. The water company, together with more than a dozen Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station, forcibly cut off the water pipes at 2 PM on the 18th. The households believed that the police detectives dared to openly oppress taxpayers and cut off their daily essential water supply. Therefore, a few households were willing to sacrifice themselves and resist by force. Later, after the best efforts of all parties to dissuade them, they endured the pain and allowed the water to be cut off, and no tragedy occurred. Afterwards, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency went to investigate. After the water supply to the lane was cut off, the required drinking water was purchased from old stoves. When necessary, such as washing rice, the Taiping tap was opened to meet urgent needs and closed immediately after use. The tenants' self-government association has notified the landlord, requesting that the water company open the water supply immediately, and appealed to the Real Estate Association, requesting that the association submit a petition to the Municipal Government today and raise this case for negotiation.</p>

<h3>Stock Subscription Will Absolutely Not Be Extended</h3>
<p>It was reported a few days ago that the deadline for the Bureau's stock subscription was about to be extended.

According to him, the stock subscription deadline was decided by the Executive Yuan and cannot be easily changed or extended. As for the stock price, it is expected that it will not increase in the future. The Bureau will cease stock subscriptions at the Central Bank from March 1st onwards.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order Sets Deadline for Closure</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the China Merchants Bureau received an order from the Ministry yesterday, instructing compliance. The order stated that since the Bureau was brought under state ownership, all of its shares had been ordered to be repurchased by the deadline of February 28th of this year, according to the predetermined price. As the deadline is approaching, it is imperative to expedite the process and close on schedule. The Bureau is hereby ordered to strictly comply and submit a detailed report on the repurchase and closure status. This order is issued.</p>
<h3>All Recent Stock Purchases</h3>
<p>Since receiving the order to repurchase shares last year, the Board of Directors has dispatched personnel to repurchase shares at the Central Bank.

It is predicted that approximately 30,000 sets will be repurchased by the end of February.</p>
<h3>Repurchase of Yangtze Wharf</h3>

<h3>Post Office Temporarily Postpones Postage Increase for Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Believes This Concerns the Livelihood of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The regulations for collecting fees for overseas mail, established by the Ministry of Transportation, stipulate a fee of five cents for every twenty grams of mail sent to the South Seas Islands and the Federated Malay States. The Shanghai General Post Office submitted a request to the Ministry on the 7th of this month, requesting that the postage for Southeast Asia be changed to an increased charge of twelve and a half cents for every twenty grams. The Ministry, considering that this measure concerns the livelihood of overseas Chinese, specifically consulted the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for review. Subsequently, the Commission responded, expressing opposition to the postal bureau's proposed regulations, citing concerns for the livelihood of overseas Chinese. According to news from the post office yesterday, the Ministry has issued a directive to Shanghai regarding the proposed increase in postage for Southeast Asia. Due to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's strong opposition, it has been decided to temporarily postpone the implementation.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Wusong Handcart Tax</h3>
<p>To Prevent Villagers from Taking Detours and Benefit Reconstruction</p>
<p>Over ten stores in Wusong, including Wanchunshun, Xieshengyuan, and Shengtailai, believe that the busiest times for commerce in Wusong are during the spring and autumn seasons. This is because yellow croaker are abundant in the spring, and villagers from the interior use handcarts to transport them to Wusong for sale in Luodian, Baoshan, Yuepu, Yangxing, and other places in the interior. In the autumn, they bring the cotton they have harvested to Wusong to sell. During these two seasons, villagers gather in Wusong, taking the opportunity to buy and sell various goods. Wusong's commerce relies on this, and the rise and fall of business revenue during these two seasons is considered an indicator of the year's overall profit and loss. However, since the City Finance Bureau began rigorously implementing regulations for collecting handcart taxes, merchants and residents from the interior, in order to avoid paying the tax, have mostly taken detours to other ports, ceasing to come to Wusong altogether. Wusong's commerce, already declining due to the reduced population after the war, has been further devastated by the absence of these villagers. The cotton market was greatly affected last autumn, and with the spring fishing season approaching, the merchants, for the sake of reviving commerce in the disaster area, for the sake of the city's reconstruction, and for the sake of their own interests, have specifically written to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce Office, requesting that this handcart tax be waived, so as to attract the villagers to come as before. The Wusong branch office has transferred the request to the City Chamber of Commerce, which has informed the City Government to notify the Finance Bureau to exempt the tax collection.</p>
<h3>Wenchu Salt Affairs Improvement Association Telegraphs Request for Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>The Wenchu Salt Affairs Improvement Association telegraphed the Salt Affairs Administration requesting a legal interpretation and also telegraphed the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "To the esteemed members of the Legislative Yuan and the Minister of Finance in Nanjing, regarding Article 1, Section A of the Salt Affairs Administration's rules for suppressing Zhejiang salt merchants selling salt, which states that 'those who increase prices privately and do not sell according to the official prices within each district shall be fined fifty times the amount of the extra profit obtained,' suppose a salt merchant violates this rule and increases prices privately, he should be fined according to the regulations. However, salt merchants and salt officials collude, and even if households report the violation, it is not investigated or handled. The people are indignant and sue in court. The judge investigates, the evidence is conclusive, and after a trial, he is convicted of defrauding money, sentenced to detention and a fine, and the crime is established. Should the offender be exempt from the administrative agency's penalty of fifty times the money because of the court's conviction, or should the administrative agency execute the penalty without further investigation because the court's conviction makes the evidence even more conclusive? This fine is a double punishment for a single crime, and there is no precedent in law. However, one is a judicial judgment, and the other is an administrative penalty. The nature of the institutions is different, so it seems that they are not subject to this restriction. Moreover, salt laws have special circumstances and are different from ordinary laws. It is believed that the special penalty provisions should not be waived just because of a court conviction. The legislative intent of the Salt Affairs Administration is probably because treacherous merchants and giant moths privately raise prices, disturb the people, mislead the country, and cause too much harm, so a particularly heavy penalty is specified, with a provision of fifty times the amount. If the matter can be settled with a court conviction and the administrative agency is exempt from the penalty, then treacherous merchants and giant moths can arbitrarily increase prices, heavily exploit, and reap huge profits. If they are unlucky enough to be exposed, they can try to manipulate the situation, avoid the heavier penalty, and be convicted by the court, so they can escape the heavy penalty of fifty times the amount, and the huge amount of privately increased profits will be preserved intact. In this way, even if the Salt Affairs Administration has this provision, it is still just a document. Treacherous merchants and giant moths will wantonly take advantage of loopholes, which is certainly not the legislative intent. How should such a situation be handled when it occurs? There is no precedent and no explanation. Therefore, we specially telegraph to request clear guidance so that we can follow it. Respectfully submitted by Xiang Foshi, Chen Jingfu, Li Junfu, and Qian Zhifang, standing committee members of the Wenchu Salt Affairs Improvement Association."</p>

<h3>The Tunan Steamer Smashed a Sand Boat</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's "Tunan" steamer, at about 10 a.m. yesterday, while sailing out of port, reached the Huangpu River near the Tan Du Wharf in Wusong, when a Jimei fishing boat was moving in front of it. Because both were sailing along the same shipping lane, the boats were in danger of colliding, and the steamer quickly tried to avoid the fishing boat by sailing closer to the shore. As a result, it violently collided with a sand boat docked there. After the incident, the steamer did not have time to brake and sailed close to the Outer Bund, almost running aground, but it managed to reverse out of danger. It finally sailed out of port at about 1 p.m. The damaged sand boat has now been towed into the Zao Bang River and is awaiting repairs. It is said that the stern of the sand boat was smashed, causing heavy losses. The owner of the boat has sent an elder to Shanghai to negotiate compensation with the Bureau.</p>
<h3>The Organization of the China Fertilizer Research Association</h3>
<p>Chinese farmers have traditionally lacked research on fertilizers and soil. In recent years, foreign fertilizers have taken the opportunity to flood the market. According to a survey report by the Zhejiang Construction Department, the amount of foreign imports has recently reached over 23.2 million yuan per year, and the trend is still increasing, which is alarming. Among these fertilizers, ammonium sulfate is the most widely sold. However, its composition is only a weak element. If it is used indiscriminately without considering the soil conditions, the adverse effects will be great. This is a major issue for the prosperity and decline of China's rural areas, not just a matter of outflowing benefits. Chinese agricultural experts Lin Jianzhong and others, in light of this serious situation, have gathered like-minded people and organized the China Fertilizer Research Association in the French Concession on Avenue Baille. They will use the results of their research to guide farmers. They are currently recruiting members to conduct research together. For a time, well-known figures and faculty and students from various schools have joined in large numbers. The association is developing rapidly.</p>
<h3>Quirke's Report on the Recent Situation of the Qin Island Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees previously received a report from Mr. Qu Wenli, who returned from Qinhuangdao, stating that Mr. Quirke, the general manager of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, had spared no effort in assisting with the relief of disaster victims and had agreed to serve as the association's resident staff member on the island. On February 6th, the association sent a letter of thanks to Mr. Quirke and inquired about the recent situation of the disaster victims. Yesterday, they received a reply from Mr. Quirke, which stated, "Dear Sirs, I have received your letter of February 6th with respect. The recent situation of the disaster victims here is not much different from what Mr. Qu Wenli saw when he arrived on the island. At present, there is no need for large-scale relief efforts, which is a comfort from afar. I have now invited Mr. Bian Wulou, the chief accountant of the mining bureau, to join our staff as honorary treasurer, and Mr. Tang Diqing as honorary clerk. Mrs. Ma Xu, Gu Suchen, and Tang Diqing serve as staff members of the investigation group. This association immediately investigates and reports when it learns of families in need of relief. The staff members are close to the refugees so that they can accurately know whether the masses are truly in need of relief as a result of recent events. The focus is always on meeting the actual needs of the refugees. I am enclosing a survey form for this investigation. I hope you will review it. Bi Zhixuan and Bian Wulou serve as staff members of the distribution group and have contacted local merchants to purchase relief supplies at cost-effective prices, which refugees can pick up with tickets. Food has recently been provided, but the need is not great and the scale is small. It is not planned to provide further monetary relief. Individuals who voluntarily contribute donations are not subject to this restriction. The mining bureau's medical officers have also been requested to assist, and patients have been treated and cured. It is earnestly hoped that the situation will soon return to normal and the refugees will return home to resume their businesses.</p>
<h3>The Huangpu Steamer Sailed Safely to Hankou Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>All Workers Traveled with the Ship</p>
<p>Representatives of Each Steamer Gathered to Discuss How to Deal with the Situation</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the British-owned Taikoo Company recently planned to continue firing workers on the Huangpu Steamer, causing serious disputes. The steamer sailed to Hankou yesterday morning without causing any trouble. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Workers Accompanied the Ship</h3>
<p>All 86 workers in the Huangpu Steamer's midship section opposed the company's unreasonable layoffs, so they all stayed on the ship and vowed not to leave the ship. Although the company had threatened them in various ways, saying that if they did not leave the ship, they would be forcibly evicted like the Wusong Steamer, the workers were determined. Until 4 a.m. yesterday morning, the company had not taken any action, and the steamer sailed to Hankou. All the workers remained on the ship, working as usual.</p>
<h3>Gathering to Discuss the Situation</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Steamer Seamen's Midship Labor Union believed that the Taikoo Company was deliberately oppressing workers. The dispute on the Wusong Steamer had not been resolved, and the dispute on the Huangpu Steamer had already begun. If proper measures were not taken to deal with the situation, accidents would inevitably occur in the future. Therefore, at 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon, representatives of each steamer were convened to discuss how to deal with the situation. Over 40 representatives from each steamer, including Lu Rong, Tao Youxi, Gao Yongliu, and Wang Oumin, attended. The meeting was chaired by Lu Shuangxi. Several measures were discussed and decided, but the contents will not be announced for the time being.</p>
<h3>A Child Was Injured Playing by a Vehicle</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM on the 18th of this month, at the Gongjia Road Station of the Shangchuan Transportation Company, a northbound vehicle had just started moving but had not yet left the station. Suddenly, two neighboring children climbed onto the footboard of the second passenger car from the platform. One of the children, Zhang Binghe, fell onto the tracks due to a moment of carelessness. The stationmaster immediately sounded the whistle and yelled to stop the car. Although the driver braked immediately, it was too late, and the child's legs were crushed. The company immediately called the family and sent them to the Tongren Hospital for treatment on the next train across the river. It is reported that although the injuries are severe, there is no immediate danger to the child's life.</p>
<h3>[P Treating Litigation Like a Child's Game&gt;</h3>
<p>Jin Agui's Lawsuit for Incitement Was Not Accepted</p>
<p>Dai Xiaomei, the younger sister of Dai Rongsheng, a chauffeur for a certain lawyer, was originally married to Jin Hegui. Recently, after the woman returned to Ningbo, she suddenly refused to return to her husband's home. Jin, listening to slander, hired lawyer Huang Zixiong to write a complaint to the First Special District District Court against his father-in-law, Dai Yongnian, and his brother-in-law, Dai Rongsheng, asking them to be punished for the crime under Article 315 of the Criminal Law. On Saturday afternoon, Judge Qian Wenji opened the court to hear the case. The defendant, Dai Yongnian, lived in the countryside and did not arrive. His son, Rongsheng, appeared in court with his defense lawyer, Wu Linkun. Lawyer Wu stated that the lawsuit filed by the plaintiff was illegal. After examining the complaint, Judge Qian stated that even if the plaintiff's legal claim was valid, the Dai family father and son were only instigators, and the principal offender was Dai Xiaomei. He then asked the plaintiff why he did not prosecute the principal offender and only accused the instigator. He further argued that litigation must first establish one's own position and not be hasty. Otherwise, if the lawsuit was proven to be false, he would be held responsible for false accusations. Jin was speechless. At this time, Jin's lawyer, Huang Zixiong, arrived late, carrying his briefcase. Judge Qian immediately questioned lawyer Huang about whether he had obtained the client's consent before writing the complaint and the reasons for not prosecuting the principal offender and only accusing the instigator. After being questioned, the lawyer was unable to give a definite answer. The court considered that this type of litigation was like a child's game and immediately ruled that the case would not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Patient Died After Vomiting Blood Before Receiving Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, a patient surnamed Chen from Pudong arrived at the Shixiaoshan Orthopedic Clinic at No. 67 Xinxin Street outside the Dadongmen Gate to register for treatment. Unexpectedly, because he was severely injured, he vomited blood incessantly while waiting for treatment. Upon seeing this, the clinic immediately reported to the police, who took him by car, intending to send him to the Red Cross. He collapsed and died just outside the door. The deceased was about 50 years old, wearing a black satin jacket, a gray crepe cotton robe, a silk wool-lined coat, a woolen shirt, and black wool pants. He had socks and black shoes. He had one silver dollar, six copper coins, and a key. Because no family members could be found, the police station ordered Lu Yongde, the local chief of the 16th Pu, to report to the local court for examination.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on Jiangxi Work Relief Summary</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Fuyou-Renyou Liangxu Work Relief, jointly sponsored by the Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Association and the Chinese Moral Endeavor Society, cost a total of over 42,090 silver dollars. Details will be published separately in the newspapers. After the floods in June of last year, Mr. Huang Wenxue, a silk merchant from Nanchang, and others reported that the hundreds of Zhang of dikes in Guangfeng Xu in the western countryside of the province had been washed away by the floods. Mr. Huang, representing the residents of the Xu, came to Shanghai repeatedly to request assistance from the association to repair the dikes, so as to protect farmland and ensure the lives of the people. They also requested that the Jiangxi provincial government undertake to build a section of the Guangfeng Xu and that the association build a section, estimated at over 40,000 cubic feet of earthwork. The association considered that Guangfeng Xu was a huge dike in the province, over 40 li long, protecting tens of thousands of acres of farmland, which was extremely important. It was estimated that over 30,000 yuan would be needed to complete the project. Therefore, the association jointly sponsored the Chinese and Foreign Yizhenhui, co-organized by the Shanghai Huayang Yizhenhui and the Moral Endeavor Society, which donated 6,500 yuan, and the Moral Endeavor Society donated 1,500 yuan. The remainder was allocated by the association. After a meeting, it was publicly promoted that Mr. Jun Yunmen was the director, and the relief worker Mr. Gu Bin was invited to go to repair the dam. He is currently taking the Changxing steamer to Hanchuan on the 10th of the month to be transferred to Ganzhou, and the construction will start immediately. It is essential to make efforts during this spring break, and it can be completed before the spring rains, protecting farmland and seeking to relieve the people's livelihood. This is fundamental relief. However, the association's economy is exhausted, and it is hoped that patriotic people will be happy to help it succeed.</p>

<p>At 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a man identified as Mr. Jia, who appeared to be a worker in his thirties wearing short clothes, was walking on Minquan Road in the French Concession, heading east from the west, when he suddenly vomited blood profusely in front of No. 328. He fell to the ground and died instantly. The police discovered the body and reported it to the Dadazimingzhong police station, which sent detectives to investigate.

<h3>Policeman Shoots Police Chief and His Wife, Then Shoots Himself in the Head, Dying in Hospital</h3>
<p>Feud Over Trivial Matters, Dismissal Incites Rage</p>
<p>Wicked Police Officer Rampages, Deserving of Death</p>
<p>Police Chief Chen Dekui and his wife of the Hongqiao Town police station, which is part of the 6th District, 1st Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau in Xinjing Town, northwest of Shanghai, were shot and killed by policeman Li Zhang last Sunday (the 18th) at around 3 p.m. Li Zhang then shot himself in the head, fell to the ground injured, and was sent to the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital on Robegan Road by police car for treatment. He succumbed to his injuries and died in the hospital at 7 a.m. yesterday. This was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a more detailed account:</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of the Deceased</h3>
<p>Chen Dekui, 36 years old, was from Jinghai, Hebei. He joined the force on September 9th of the Republic's ninth year. He was currently a second-class police chief. He was very amiable and diligent in his duties, earning the praise of his superiors. After the January 28th Incident, he was transferred to the Hongqiao Road Aircraft Factory to guard the ruined factory grounds. Last winter, he was transferred back to the Hongqiao Town police station for the second time. Local residents deeply felt they had found a good man, especially as he hated evil as an enemy. He was met with a violent death. A policeman in the station named Li Zhang, 38 years old, was from Daming Prefecture, Hebei. He joined the force on August 4th of the Republic's 13th year. He was currently a second-class policeman. He was very cunning and wicked, and had an affair with Madam Zhang, the widow of the late He Liang-sheng in the town. They rented a room at No. 24 North Street, Gu Ruixiang's house. Chen's wife, Zhen, 31 years old, was from Shandong. She had just moved to No. 28 North Street, Hongqiao Town, on the 2nd of this month, living with Li.</p>
<h3>Quarrel Between Two Women</h3>
<p>However, Madam Zhang and Zhen had a quarrel despite living together for less than a few days. On the 9th of this month, Police Chief Chen found another place to live nearby at No. 3, 25th Street, Wang Jianqiu's house, separating from Li. Last Sunday (the 17th), Madam Zhang lost two floorboards and falsely accused Zhen of stealing them. Li went to Zhen's place to look for the boards, but found nothing. Zhen then questioned Li, who became angry and lashed out, slapping Zhen twice in the face. Chen happened to be returning home from the station and immediately stepped forward to apologize and persuade him, saying, "We are old friends of many years, why listen to slander and hurt our feelings?" The matter was settled, and they went to bed. This was the day before the incident.</p>
<h3>Dismissed From the Station</h3>
<p>It was discovered that Li Zhang had recently developed a habit of [opium smoking].</p>
<p>He often forcibly purchased opium from various opium dens, leading to complaints from local residents to Bureau Chief Bi. An investigation was about to be launched. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning at around 11 a.m., Police Chief Chen reported that Li Zhang was indeed smoking opium outside. Bureau Chief Bi immediately ordered his dismissal and instructed Chen to return first to avoid resentment from Li Zhang. At around 2:30 p.m., the policeman holding the dismissal order arrived. Chen then summoned Li Zhang, showed him the dismissal order. Li had just finished his shift, and his loaded pistol (without a holster) was still hidden in his pocket. He stood in front of Chen, and upon hearing the news of his dismissal, immediately tore up the order, drew his gun, and fired a shot at Police Chief Chen's temple. The bullet pierced his brain. Chen, who was sitting on a chair in the office, fell to the ground in response. Blood splattered everywhere, and he immediately died. By the time the doorman arrived, it was too late.</p>
<h3>Shooting of Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>Li Zhang, still full of rage, escaped over the river from the back door and ran to Chen's residence. Zhen and the younger sister of the landlord Wang Jianqiu, Lingyuan, were in the kitchen making dough balls (according to the custom of offering sacrifices to the kitchen god on the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month).</p>
<p>Without asking why, Li fired a shot at the back of Zhen's head. The bullet exited from her right eye, and she immediately fell to the ground and died. Fortunately, Lingyuan was quick-witted and hid under the table, otherwise she might have also been killed. Li fled and ran to his residence at No. 24 North Street. Seeing the police gathering in front and behind, knowing that escape was impossible, he shot himself in the head and fell to the ground. Because the shot was not fatal, he regained consciousness around 6 p.m. and was sent to the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital on Robegan Road for treatment. However, due to excessive bleeding, he died in the hospital at around 8 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Shooting</h3>
<p>Bureau Chief Bi Zhenhua immediately ordered Inspector Sun Yaoshan to handle all matters. He also ordered the local bailiff Gu Xianchun to report the case to the hospital. At around 12 p.m. yesterday, the hospital dispatched Prosecutor Yang Qi, accompanied by coroner Xuan, to the countryside to conduct an examination. The examination confirmed that Police Chief Chen and his wife were shot and killed by the wicked policeman Li Zhang. Li Zhang died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He ordered photographs to be taken and filed, and the three bodies were handed over to the Public Security Bureau for collection. Zhang Binglin has been temporarily assigned to replace the vacant position.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Competition for the British Cup Yesterday</h3>
<p>Annual Event Not Related to Deployment</p>
<p>Chinese Team Scores the Most in Deployment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps has an annual British Cup competition, donated by the British community in Shanghai, specifically for non-British teams within the Volunteer Corps. Over the years, the competition has been fierce. It is understood that the competition method for this year's cup has been changed to better align with the Volunteer Corps' practical duties, and the competition will be divided into deployment planning and shooting skills, with particular emphasis on deployment.

It is said that these were members of the various teams, scheming and competing, planning meticulous deployment methods on the ground. Many residents in the area misunderstood the situation. After explanations from the Chinese team members, they were relieved.

The detailed total score will be finalized after review by the Corps Commander, Thompson.</p>

<h3>Rice Industry Dispute Over Rice Measures: Measuring Masters Request Abolition of Nested Measuring Containers</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Permission to Retain Deficient Measures</p>
<p>Although the dispute over heavy and light measures in the rice industry has been addressed by party and government organs, it has not been concretely resolved due to the complexity of the situation. All the measuring masters feel it difficult to deal with shipowners and rice stores who demand nested measures. The union has submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department and the Bureau of Social Affairs to abolish this practice. The text of the submission is as follows: Request to abolish the evil practice of rice stores not complying with standards and arbitrarily demanding nested measures, causing measuring masters to be exhausted and suffer losses. Request that rice stores be ordered to send their own personnel to supervise the measures on the ships, and abolish the nested measure evil practice, or request that shipowners be ordered to allow measuring masters to retain the deficient measures to satisfy the desires of the rice stores, and leave the measuring masters some way to survive (omitted). It is earnestly requested that your department and bureau, based on the position of maintaining the upward transport, relieve the suffering of the laborers, and promptly order all rice stores that, after a transaction is successful, they should immediately send their own personnel to supervise the measures on the ships. Once the rice is bagged and unloaded ashore, the measuring masters are no longer responsible for nested measures, to show fairness. Otherwise, it is also earnestly requested that your bureau order the shipowners to allow the measuring masters to retain the deficient measures to satisfy the desires of the rice stores, to facilitate work and relieve the difficulties.</p>
<h3>Announcement from the National Lichiaou General Federation</h3>
<p>Holding a Commemoration of the Lifting of the Ban</p>
<p>Dagon Society states: The National Lichiaou General Federation yesterday issued a notice to more than 800 Lichiaou public associations in Jiangsu Province, stating: Concerning the matter of the Jiangsu Provincial Government approving the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department's proposal to investigate and ban Lichiaou public associations in June of the Republic's 18th year, this federation petitioned the Central Party Department and the Executive Yuan to request the lifting of the ban on investigating and banning Lichiaou. Subsequently, on February 26th of the Republic's 19th year, the Ministry of Interior issued Announcement No. 2 of the Rites Section, which roughly stated: Having received Executive Yuan Instruction No. 736, which stated: The Central Party Department approved the lifting of the ban on investigating and banning Lichiaou, ordering the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department to immediately revoke the original proposal to ban Lichiaou public associations, etc. The Ministry ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to lift the ban and inform the Lichiaou Association, etc. Upon receiving this, in addition to informing the Jiangsu Provincial Government for their information, this federation is also issuing a notice to inform the association.

Demonstrating the virtues of the Party and the state, this association immediately informed all public associations and colleagues across the country that they should abide by the public precepts, restrain themselves and cherish themselves, obey the national laws, and persuade and戒除 smoke and alcohol, so that the compatriots across the country would abandon the suffering of smoke and alcohol. Every year on February 26th, all Lichiaou public associations in Jiangsu Province would hold a commemorative general meeting on record.

This announcement is made specifically for this purpose.</p>
<h3>Xuchang Tobacco Production Area Tax Affairs Office Distributes American Seeds</h3>
<p>The Xuchang area of ​​Henan Province is rich in the production of tobacco leaves. Several years ago, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and British American Tobacco Company purchased American varieties and brought them to the area for distribution and trial planting. The results were excellent. However, in recent years, due to local political conditions, various companies have stopped distributing new varieties.

<h3>American Resident Takes a Chinese Woman as Wife, Operates Gambling Den, Skimming Profits, Losing and Winning Heavily</h3>
<p>American Consul Denies, Recognizing the Chinese Woman as an American</p>
<p>After Review, Fine of 500 Yuan Imposed</p>
<p>No. 9 Dongyouheng Middle Lane is the residence of Mr. Anderson, an American resident in Shanghai. Anderson's wife is a Ningbo woman, about 30 years old. Recently, Inspector Yao Jialin of the C District of the Police Department discovered that Mrs. Anderson specializes in operating a gambling den and skimming profits. Every day, she personally invites gamblers, and those who live further away are picked up by car. The profits earned each day are very high. Inspector Yao then requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant. At 4:30 p.m. on the 16th of this month, he led the police to the residence to conduct a search. Upon arrival, Mrs. Anderson was gambling with invited gamblers Yang Ayin, Shen Caifu, and Fan Dexi, playing digging flower. Mr. Anderson himself was watching the game. They were all arrested. All gambling money, 155 yuan in banknotes, 14 yuan in cash, 17 double cents, 11 single cents, a set of digging flower cards, and shaking cylinders were brought into the police station. Except for transferring the Andersons to the US Consulate in Shanghai for interrogation, the remaining three people, Yang, Shen, and Fan, together with the gambling paraphernalia, were sent to the First Special Court the next morning. Judge Zhang Gaoqing found the investigation to be true and sentenced each to a fine of 100 yuan, and the gambling paraphernalia and money were confiscated. The Andersons were also questioned by the American official that day. Mrs. Anderson denied being an American citizen and was sent back to the police station. She was then transferred to the First Special Court again. Judge Zhang questioned her again. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu accused her of the crime of gathering to gamble and skimming profits, based on Article 280 of the Criminal Code. Inspector Yao also reported the details of the case, stating that the daily amount of money flowing through the gambling den was about 1,000 yuan, so the magnitude of the losses and winnings can be imagined. When questioned, Mrs. Anderson spoke in her Ningbo dialect, claiming that her husband worked for a foreign company, earning hundreds of gold in monthly salary, and living comfortably, so there was no need to skim profits. Moreover, the residence was a small rubber room, so if the daily amount of money flowing through the gambling den was 1,000 yuan, there must be many gamblers, and the room could not accommodate them. Judge Zhang found the evidence conclusive and sentenced her to a fine of 500 yuan. Lawyer Fan Gang, representing the defendant, declared dissatisfaction and requested bail to file an appeal. The court granted the request and ordered the woman to pay 500 yuan in bail to wait for instructions.</p>

Ni's wife hired a lawyer to file a request to continue the lawsuit against Luo Feiying in the First Special District Court. The case was tried by Judge Qian of the First Special Court the day before yesterday. Ni's wife was still in mourning for her husband and was therefore not present. Her lawyer appeared in court to represent her, but the defendant Luo Feiying failed to appear, so the case could not be tried. Judge Qian ordered a re-summons of the defendant for future interrogation.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, In the "Great Shanghai Man and Woman Double Suicide" item in your newspaper's Shanghai Local News section on the 16th of this month, there are the words "The woman's name is Tan Wenbing, a Nanjing middle school student." Upon investigation, our school currently and previously has no such person as Tan Wenbing. The reporter's intention is probably to describe a middle school student from Nanjing, but the four words "Nanjing Middle School" have become a fixed noun. For fear that readers may misunderstand, please investigate and correct this. With best wishes, Sincerely, Nanjing Middle School of Jiangsu Province, February 17th.</p>
<p>Readers' Advisor</p>
<h3>Where is the Path of Struggle?</h3>
<p>······Letter from Dingyuan Village, Haimen, Jiangsu······</p>
<p>I deeply admire Mr. Er Yue Wu Yue's insightful reply to Wang Yue Jun's "Is My View on Suicide Correct?" Indeed, suicide is merely cowardly, shameful, and an act of escapism if we have not forgotten our responsibility to humanity. However, Mr. Er Yue, the problem arises again. Before the realization of socialism, modern society possesses an interdependent chain. You see, whether in political, business, or academic circles, they must have some kind of connection or powerful guarantee to climb the dragon gate. Especially for the children of the poor, who finally reach adulthood only to be oppressed by hunger and cold, they are fortunate enough to find someone to recommend them for a job. Parents naturally hope their sons will improve, make money, or return home in glory! But on the other hand, as Mr. Ren says, "There are some people who are neurotic." No, I think it is a sober-minded youth who has not yet become numb, and it is easy for them to feel the pain of oppression and poverty. They are not accustomed to the darkness of the current society and the cruelty of humanity. They begin to struggle, begin to struggle for all of humanity! However, as mentioned above, modern society possesses an interdependent chain. If they struggle against all evil forces, undoubtedly their position and their profession will be broken. They will join the ranks of the unemployed, and their surroundings will be filled with constant mockery and contempt! Their parents will scold and grieve! Ah! In such an environment of multiple attacks, where can they go? Look for a job again? They cannot gain the favor of capitalists. Go home? There is no inheritance at home. Good, then continue to struggle! But struggle cannot be done on an empty stomach. Looking around the country, there is no strong struggle group to join. Society is still dark, humanity is still cruel. They will feel the pain of life and the despair of struggle even more. Everything will force them to take the passive path of suicide. Mr. Er Yue, I am such a youth, worried about the future and hesitating, not knowing the path to struggle. Although my job has not yet been taken away, I always feel that individual actions, before a means of rescue is obtained, are a futile sacrifice of one's current profession! "Of course, those youth with property are excluded from the struggle." Mr. Er Yue, what do you think? Perhaps you despise this wait-and-see attitude and the mentality of sitting back and waiting for results? But the reality is like this. I sincerely hope that you can clearly point out a real path of struggle for us poor youth!</p>
<p>Answer: Our opinions on the questions of "suicide" and "where is the path of struggle?" have been scattered in previous replies to various readers. If you pay close attention, you can surely obtain our true opinions on these questions between the lines. Your questions no longer need to be answered. However, there are two points that must be solemnly told to you: Today, you are not the only one struggling. Many people have no way out, many people are struggling. This force is very great. You do not see the power of many people, so you feel that one person struggling alone is very weak, and there is not much hope for the future. That is a mistake. That is the first point. Naturally, struggling with evil forces is not a pleasant pastime, but a matter of life and death. If you are afraid of losing your job and afraid of struggling on an empty stomach, then you can only bow down at the feet of the evil forces every day, seeking a small amount of grain to support yourself and your wife and children. What is there to talk about struggle? You only care about your "current profession"! That is the second point. In short, if we struggle with evil forces and only focus on ourselves, our families, a single place, a single society fighting on their own, not knowing how to unite, then there is no reason for success. Moreover, the struggle against evil forces, whether in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad, is done by some unemployed rebels (either rebelling because of unemployment or becoming unemployed because of rebellion, both being the same) and by people whose lives are close to unemployment or whose interests are the same as those of the unemployed. There is absolutely no (at least 99 percent of the time) person who is rich and powerful who comes to struggle with evil forces, or who, before struggling, first asks a job insurance company to insure them. Wouldn't that be a joke? What do you mean by your statement, "Of course, those youth with property are excluded from the struggle"? How many "youth with property" have you seen who can engage in resolute struggle? And what exactly are they struggling for? I would like you to tell me.</p>

<h3>Students of Beiping Normal University Greatly Inconvenienced by Relocation to Xi'an</h3>
<p>(Beiping, 19th) Regarding the matter of Normal University's relocation to Xi'an, the school has not yet received an order from the Ministry of Education. Faculty, staff, and students are all opposed to it, especially the female students. If the relocation to Xi'an is realized, it is feared that most of the female students will transfer to other universities because most of the female students are from the South and are unwilling to go North.</p>
<h3>Suggestion from Zhenjiang Normal School, Jiangsu Province:</h3>
<p>Raise Funds throughout the Province's Middle Schools to Purchase Airplanes</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang Normal School, at its school affairs meeting on the 17th, proposed to gather the strength of teachers and students from middle schools throughout the province to purchase airplanes through small contributions. It was decided to separately suggest to the Provincial Middle School Federation and the Middle School Faculty and Staff Federation in order to accumulate small amounts into a large sum, gather sand into a tower, and learn from the lessons of war, so as to help the current serious situation and save the country from danger. It is an unshirkable duty, and it is hoped that all circles will rise up and discuss this.</p>
<p>In addition, all faculty, staff, students, and school workers of the school collectively raised more than 460 yuan and remitted it to Shanghai for transfer to the Northeast Volunteer Army. Yesterday, the school affairs meeting again decided to continue the method of the previous semester, with faculty and staff donating at least 1% of their salary each month, students donating one copper coin per day, and school workers donating one dime per month. Once a certain amount is collected, it will be immediately remitted to Shanghai for forwarding to the front lines.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Requires Buddhist Schools to Adhere to Party Guidelines (1)</h3>
<p>Reply to the Ministry of Interior's Inquiry Regarding the Organizational Outline of the Buddhist Academy of the Chinese Buddhist Association</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously approved the Chinese Buddhist Association's proposed organizational outline for Buddhist academies at all levels, which was sent by the Ministry of Interior. Important errors in it have been separately discussed. The Ministry has drafted two sections of measures, requesting that personnel be dispatched to jointly study them. At the same time, an order was issued to the original petitioner to revise it again based on this inquiry and resubmit it within a time limit for review. The inquiry and the outline of the Buddhist Academy are as follows:</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education's Inquiry to the Ministry of Interior</h3>
<p>It is hereby noted that last year, the Ministry received Inquiry No. 419 regarding the Chinese Buddhist Association's submission of a request for the organizational outline of Buddhist academies at all levels to be reviewed and filed for record. The inquiry requested a review and response for processing. Attached was a copy of the outline. It is hereby noted that there are many points in the outline of the organization of Buddhist academies at all levels that should be corrected. At this time when the monastic community is beginning to realize the importance of seeking education and knows that running education is a key way to save oneself and others, it is not appropriate to nitpick and be overly restrictive. However, the great principles and laws established and implemented by the country must also not be completely free, lest they violate the fundamental purpose of universal education and betray the principle of religious freedom. If in the future, Jesus, the Catholic Church, and Islam all follow suit, then everything will be fragmented and chaotic. What will become of it? The important errors in the outline are discussed separately below, and the main points of the various measures drafted by this Ministry are detailed separately. It is hoped that your Ministry will quickly select specialized personnel to study the measures jointly with this Ministry, and at the same time issue an order to the original petitioner to revise it again based on this inquiry and resubmit it to the government for review and implementation within three months, so as to ensure that both politics and religion are taken care of, and the future of national culture can also benefit.</p>
<p>Section 1</p>
<p>It is hereby noted that Article 3 of the outline stipulates that the purpose of Buddhist academies at all levels is "to cultivate Sangha talents, promote the meaning of Mahayana Buddhism, inspire Bodhi, and transform society." This meaning does not violate national law, but the name "Sangha" cannot be arbitrarily applied without restriction. All countries have restrictions on the people's religious beliefs. Those who do not have the qualifications for civil legal achievements according to the law shall not be subject to any religious conversion ceremony. The legislative intent of our country is also the same as the general principles of various countries. Even in Buddhism itself, its monastic laws also have clear provisions that those who are not at least 20 years old and have not obtained the permission of their biological parents and the country to which they belong shall not receive the full ordination and become a senior monk. According to the principles of both Buddhist law and secular law, it can be seen that the original legislative intent was to respect the freedom of the believer himself. If his personality is not yet complete and his freedom of opinion is not sufficient, he must not be forced to believe in any religion by the will of others. The law is excellent, and the intention is beautiful. In China's previous dynasties, both politics and religion fell into decline, and both Buddhist law and secular law declined. Temples and monasteries indiscriminately accepted young disciples, and even breastfed children were tonsured and made senior monks before they reached adulthood. If these long-standing malpractices are not eradicated, what future troubles can be imagined? If it is said that there are many poor people in the local area and helpless orphans who enter the Buddhist temple and must be taken care of in order to conform to the purpose of compassion, then support is not limited to tonsuring, and education is not limited to studying Buddhism. Why should those who are taken in be treated as private property? Once this meaning is established, then in principle, each section mentioned in Article 3 of the outline should only establish schools equivalent to vocational education, like the theology departments of universities in various countries, and universities established by churches that specialize in teaching doctrines and cultivating missionaries. Primary and junior high schools must not be established, because the purpose of these two levels of education is to cultivate healthy citizens. Regardless of religion or profession, everyone must be admitted to school without discrimination due to different religions. Now, the primary and junior high schools run by Christians throughout the country are all subject to the national curriculum standards. Why should Buddhism establish its own rules again? Buddhism should be willing to abide by national law. As for the current situation in China, due to poor politics, unprosperous education, and declining culture, the monks in various places who have already become monks lack knowledge and scholarship, and their levels vary. Some have strict precepts and excellent learning and practice, while others have no sense of propriety, do not understand Buddhist doctrines, but can still abide by the precepts, while others have poor precepts and learning. This situation is equivalent to the lack of education in a class of society in China. The Buddhist Association should only establish supplementary schools at all levels on the spot for the purpose of supplementing the learning of these uneducated monks and nuns. The system of primary and junior high schools should not be borrowed to hinder the unification of the national education system. This is one point of disagreement.</p>
<p>Section 2</p>
<p>It is hereby noted that the precepts established by Buddhism are nothing more than the grades of teaching, giving, receiving and learning. In China's previous dynasties, because there were so many Buddhists, restrictions were necessary to protect the solemnity of the Buddhist gate and maintain social order. Therefore, the fourfold precept certificates were all issued by the Ministry of Rites and managed by the monastic officials. The government had strict measures to regulate all wandering monks. Now, although faith is left to the freedom of the people, Buddhism's relationship to the national destiny and the people's livelihood is extremely important and cannot be overly permissive, lest it hinder the development of the nation and the people and impede the progress of social culture. In recent years, the number of nationals from various countries coming to Chinese temples to receive precepts has been increasing day by day. Unless clear measures are established to rectify this, it will not be enough to promote Chinese culture. After repeated discussions, this Ministry has drafted the following principles for reorganizing the Sangha system regarding the ordination of Buddhist monks. Since the qualifications of students in academies at all levels stipulated in this outline are based on the level of ordination, the government must first impose restrictions on these qualifications. The various points drafted by this Ministry are as follows:</p>
<p>1. No man or woman under the age of twenty may become a monk. 2. Anyone who becomes a monk or nun must be reported to the local government by the tonsuring master monk or nun for filing. 3. Anyone who becomes a monk or nun must not receive the Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni precepts until five years after being tonsured or receiving the Sramanera or Sramaneri precepts. 4. The monastery transmitting the precepts must submit a list of the names and resumes of each recipient of the precepts to the local government six months in advance and report them separately to the Civil Affairs and Education Bureaus for filing. 5. Monasteries in various places that do not have the following qualifications and have not been approved by the Ministries of Interior and Education shall not transmit the precepts: 1. Public monasteries open to all; 2. Possessing a complete collection of the Tripitaka; 3. Having facilities for studying specialized religious academic studies and teaching. 6. The preceptor, dependence master, professor, and karmadana master of the precept transmission must understand Buddhist doctrines and laws and be approved by the Ministry of Education. 7. From 1934, precept-transmitting monasteries in various places shall suspend the transmission of Bodhisattva precepts within five years. At the same time, precept-transmitting monasteries are limited to improving their content in accordance with the provisions of Items 5 and 6 within these five years and submitting a request to the Ministries of Interior and Education to jointly send personnel to inspect them. Those who pass the inspection shall be allowed to transmit the Bodhisattva precepts. 8. Monks and nuns who have received the Bhikkhu, Bhikkhuni, and Bodhisattva precepts must have the guarantee of their tonsuring temple and the temple where they received the precepts within one year and submit it to the local government for inspection. After being stamped, the cases shall be compiled and forwarded to the Ministries of Civil Affairs and Education for filing. The precepts of those who are not of age shall be cancelled. From January 1, 1935, anyone whose precept certificate has not been inspected and has not obtained the seal of the local government shall not be allowed to hold office in monasteries in various places and shall not have any legal effect. 9. Local governments may charge handling fees for the various registrations and inspections stipulated in Items 4 and 9, taking into account local living conditions, but each item shall not exceed two yuan.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese people's beliefs, Buddhism is the most prevalent. Monasteries and monks in various places are related to local security on the one hand and social culture on the other. If they are not rectified, both the nation and Buddhism will decline. The teaching programs of academies at all levels, A, B, C, and D, proposed in this outline are based on precepts, but they neglect the measures for implementing the precepts. Even the improvement and progress of Buddhism itself are of no benefit. Not to mention that it violates the spirit of the national education system.</p>
<h3>Fujian Education Department Sends a Letter Inviting the Science Society of China to Hold Its Annual Meeting in Fujian</h3>
<p>Sichuan and Hunan Also Send Telegrams of Welcome</p>
<p>The Science Society of China, located on Albert Road in Shanghai, discussed the location of this year's annual meeting at the 17th annual meeting, tentatively choosing between Chengdu, Henan, and Kaifeng, Henan.

Please determine the meeting date as soon as possible and inform us in advance so that we can prepare. We will eagerly await your reply."

The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM. Before leaving, each student received many gifts such as books and toothpaste.</p>
<h3>Publication of Shanghai Education Circles by the Education Community of Shanghai</h3>

<h3>A Record of the Opening Ceremony of the National Protection Obligation Elementary School</h3>

Then, school director Mao and others gave speeches, roughly saying that the purpose of Buddhism is to take great compassion as the compass for saving the world. The abbot, Zhen Kong, donated funds to run a purely free school, benefiting society and making up for out-of-school children, which is truly commendable.</p>

<h3>Five-Mile Cross-Country Race Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Strolling Race Changed to Mixed Race</p>
<p>The Western Sports Association held a five-mile strolling cross-country race at Hongkou Park at 10:30 AM yesterday. However, because some athletes did not understand the purpose of this event, it could not be held and had to be changed to a mixed race. The records for each place are as follows: First and second place were the brothers Levi and Qige. The third place was Chinese Wang Zhenglin. Chinese and Western athletes who had won championships of 1,500 meters or more at various sports meets were restricted from participating, but yesterday some athletes still falsely reported that they had not participated in any sports meets and had not won any championships. Although they were ordered to withdraw, there was no effect. Therefore, the president of the Western Sports Association, Mai Kaina, temporarily did not issue the five shields yesterday and will award them to the winners when the competition is re-held next time.</p>
<h3>International Football Hopeless</h3>
<h3>2-3</h3>
<p>15,000 Fans Greatly Disappointed</p>
<p>China Suffers a Miserable Defeat to Scotland</p>
<p>Scottish Army Scores Two Goals First, China Equalizes</p>
<p>Fatal Penalty Kick in the Last Minute</p>
<p>The Chinese Team is Disorganized, with the Center Back Lacking Strength</p>
<p>England Eliminates Italy and Also Obtains the Right to the Finals</p>
<p>In extreme disappointment, the Chinese football team lost to the Scottish Western Union in the International Cup semi-final replay by a score of two to three, and was therefore eliminated. After winning the International Cup for three consecutive years, they could not even reach the final this year, which can be said to be a great surprise. The 14,000 fans in Yiyuan were greatly disappointed. In the first half, the Scottish army led by two to one. In the second half, China scored another goal, equalizing the score. In the last fifteen minutes, Scotland scored a penalty kick to determine the victory. It was a miserable defeat. The referee was Marshall.</p>
<h3>There Are Reasons For China's Failure</h3>
<p>The Chinese team possesses extremely strong elite soldiers, with five major generals as forwards. The quality of talent allocation is unparalleled. However, the reasons for their ultimate failure are something that many people must want to know. Please let me elaborate. China's failure can be summed up in one sentence: the forwards are disorganized and lack coordination, while the center backs are not strong enough. The forwards are like a scattered pile of sand, resulting in a weak attack. The only impressive aspect is Wan Xianghua. The center backs are not sturdy, allowing the enemy forwards to continuously attack. Veteran Huang Ruihua is too old and cannot be consistently reliable, lacking accurate corner kicks, which weakens the strength of the forwards. The defenders are mediocre and cannot stop the enemy forwards' movements. Therefore, even with a good goalkeeper, they cannot avoid being inferior.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Enemy Troops Were Very Different From the Day Before</p>
<p>Scotland was a different team yesterday, only including players such as Tuina and Helei. They completely shed the defeated state from the previous day's loss to Donghua, becoming energetic and invincible. They controlled the ball with every touch, dominating almost the entire game. The seamless and skillful coordination of the five forwards was astonishing. Their shooting accuracy was also rare. The center backs, Hai Shi and Helei, were indeed outstanding. The defenders did not make major mistakes. In short, judging from their performance, their victory was well-deserved.</p>
<h3>Infinitely Thrilling: The Goalkeeper Shines</h3>
<p>In the first ten minutes of the match, the situation changed dramatically. The Chinese team's goal was under constant threat, with relentless attacks and waves of danger. The spectators were stunned and speechless. The goalkeeper, Zhou Xianyan, was extremely busy, receiving and blocking shots from left and right, up and down, and was overwhelmed. If it weren't for the goalkeeper, it's hard to say how many goals would have been conceded. When the goalkeeper shines, it's a bad sign. China kicked off first, but Scotland immediately counterattacked. From 20 yards away from the goal, they earned a free kick. This initiated a relentless attack, with shots raining down on the goal. In one instance, Kelage forced Zhou Xianyan to a corner, leaving him with no choice but to throw the ball to the side. The forwards' shots were not accurate, but the center back, Hai Shi, also rushed forward to attack fiercely. Hai Shi's powerful free kick from 30 yards out was unstoppable, but fortunately, it was caught by the goalkeeper. Corner kick after corner kick, one of Kelage's headers was wonderfully caught by Xianyan, who leapt upwards. From then on, China was in trouble.</p>
<h3>Repeated Pressure Leads To Goal Conceded</h3>
<p>After fifteen minutes of intense pressure, they finally conceded a goal. During a chaotic scramble in front of the goal, Hughes' corner kick landed perfectly in front of the net. Kelage jumped up and headed the ball downwards. Zhou Xianyan was already exhausted from responding, and due to a momentary lapse in vision, the ball went in and was unrecoverable. The score was opened. The Scottish army continued their momentum. Although Hughes suffered a nose injury and bled, he returned to the field after ten minutes. At this time, China managed to break through the siege once. Sun Jinshun passed the ball, but Wan Xianghua's play ended without success. China's danger remained precarious. After more than half an hour, Jiang Shanjing sent a long pass over halfway. Wan Xianghua covered it and passed it to Li Yichen and Chen Guangyao, earning only one corner kick. Sun Jinshun kicked the ball backwards into his own territory, leaving the defense unguarded. Kelage advanced alone and scored again. China lost 2-0.</p>
<h3>The Situation Opens Up and A Draw is Achieved</h3>
<p>The perilous situation did not disappear, and crises arose everywhere. Five minutes before the end of the first half, unintentionally, the adverse situation suddenly turned around. Wan Xianghua advanced on the left, shaking off Roglesin's tackle, and immediately moved forward. He crossed the ball, Sun Jinshun received it, and passed it to Li Yichen. Li swept the ball towards the goal with force, achieving success. Thus, the score at halftime was China 1, Scotland 2. After a short break, Scotland kicked off and continued their offensive. Sun Jinshun intercepted the ball and passed it long to Li Yichen. Li sent the ball to Wan in the left corner, who attacked forcefully. Hentor threw the ball out not far enough, and the chance was wasted. Subsequently, Huang Ruihua got the ball and also passed it to the left. Wan Xianghua again advanced rapidly, reaching the corner and lobbing the ball in front of the goal. Hentor caught it but fumbled. Li Yichen immediately pushed the ball in. After only five minutes of the second half, the score was tied 2-2. Unexpectedly, in the last ten minutes, the Chinese team broke through this adverse situation.</p>
<h3>A Penalty Kick Seals China's Fate</h3>
<p>After the tie, hope gradually arose. However, the Scottish army continued to attack relentlessly. But with back and forth attacks, neither side achieved much. Although Kelage had opportunities, they were useless. The weather suddenly turned cold, with heavy snow falling. The battle continued. It was thought that a draw was possible, but who knew that with only a quarter of an hour left in the game, disaster struck. Lamond ran forward alone with no one in front of him. Seeing the situation escalating, Li Ning chased after him and tried to block him, but instead tripped Lamond in the penalty area. As a result, a penalty kick was awarded. Tuina scored, and the goalkeeper could not repeat his previous day's save. The score became 2-3, resulting in a crushing defeat. The lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Team</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Jiang Shanjing, Tu Kaiyuan, Huang Ruihua, Wu Youliang, Wan Xianghua, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Guangyao</p>
<p>Scottish Team</p>
<p>Hentor, Taokdou, Haisidi, Helei, Hai Shi, Magglasin, Hughes, Lamond, Kelage, Tuina, Li Te</p>

<h3>World Sprint Prodigy Tolun Announces Retirement</h3>
<p>Deeply Feels the Pain of Unemployment</p>
<p>Striving to Engage in a Profession</p>
<p>(New York Communication) Tideloai sends news that Eddie Tolun, the world sprint prodigy and black athlete, will announce his retirement and no longer appear on the track, deciding to strive to engage in his profession. Tolun is the Olympic champion in the 100-meter and 200-meter races. He is studying medicine at the University of Michigan. His retirement from the sports field is not due to any particular dissatisfaction, but solely to find a profession. After returning from Los Angeles last fall, he searched everywhere for a job but was disappointed. Therefore, he had no choice but to return to his hometown of Danteloai.</p>
<h3>Deeply Touched</h3>
<p>One day after Olympic athlete Lun returned to his hometown, he encountered a welcoming band and his cousin, Frank. Frank was a person who collected paper scraps on the grass in the park next to the station. Tolun was deeply touched by the scene and filled with mixed emotions, thinking that although his cousin's position was humble, he had a profession, while he could not even support his parents. Becoming a doctor after completing his studies could only be a dream.</p>
<h3>Futile Disappointment</h3>
<p>After completing four years at the University of Michigan, he suddenly became a world sprint star. The day before participating in the Olympic preliminary rounds, he wrote to his mother, saying, "When the competition results are announced, I especially hope to be the sole leader. If I can win these two events, then our worries can be reduced and we can see the light." His intention was to use this to show off and gain a high position. But winning was winning, and unemployment remained unemployment.</p>
<h3>Finally Fulfilling His Wish</h3>
<p>Today, Eddie has obtained a position as a clerk in the Tideloai local government office, which somewhat fulfills his wish. Eddie told people, "I am confident that I will no longer race. From now on, I will strive in my profession. The gold and silver medals covering the walls are not worth just this."</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Medicine in Shanghai in the Last Decade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>The above is what was said about the backbone personnel. However, the quality of a hospital is not only related to one person, but all staff members should have special training. As mentioned above, from the clerk to the yard workers, they should all be medicalized. The most important personnel are the nurses. In China, there are few hospitals and few opportunities to train nurses. Because nurses are difficult to find, it is even more difficult to run a good hospital. This is a vicious cycle that cannot be solved overnight. Originally, all management and arrangements within the hospital should be focused on the head nurse. Doctors do not need to be too involved. When foreigners run a hospital, they invite an experienced head nurse from abroad, who brings ten or so well-trained nurses, which naturally makes things twice as effective with half the effort. Chinese-run hospitals often cannot find good head nurses, and doctors have to pay attention to the work of the nurses, which makes doctors feel even more talented. I have also invited foreign head nurses to manage my hospital, but the results were not very satisfactory. For example, the director of Baolong Hospital used a non-nursing person to manage the internal affairs of the hospital, which often aroused the resentment of Chinese nurses and once caused a major uproar. Other aspects of the hospital also seemed to be subject to outside criticism, which shows the importance of the head nurse. In addition, although our Chinese nurses have a nursing association, the power and organization are not yet widespread, and the text and system cannot be unified. Nurses often misunderstand their own status. Therefore, some nurses are unwilling to devote themselves to the profession, or they enter the field of quack medicine, or they simply change careers. As a result, the nursing field itself has little progress. Therefore, I believe that if Chinese people want to run a rationalized public hospital, they must concentrate funds to reward talent on the social side, and train nurses and sacrifice private interests on the medical side.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about private hospitals. According to investigations, there are now only about forty private hospitals in Shanghai that can arrange wards and accommodate patients, with a total of less than two thousand beds. Examining their nature, there are no more than three types: (1) specialized hospitals, established by specialized doctors to showcase their skills; (2) hospitals set up by doctors who, due to the lack of public hospitals, gather several colleagues to try to run small-scale hospitals in order to accommodate their private patients; (3) sanatoriums run to cater to social psychology and attract high-end patients. Such sanatoriums are especially dominated by those run by foreigners. They have an absolutely tolerant nature regarding the rules within the sanatorium, such as opium smoking, visiting patients, sending food, and everything is very permissive, so they are most welcomed by officials and wealthy merchants. However, for the above three types of hospitals, the first type cannot be cheap because of the cost of equipment; the second type must rely on the income from ward fees to cover expenses because there are no funds to subsidize them, and they must also rely on the hospital to solve the high-end life of several doctors, so naturally they cannot be very cheap; the third type is originally for profit, and those who come to the hospital are mostly wealthy, so the fees are of course particularly expensive. Therefore, these private hospitals have simply nothing to do with the general citizens of Shanghai. However, there are also one or two places that are privately established by philanthropists and have the nature of providing free medical treatment. There are also those run by the medical community who voluntarily set up third-class wards with the surplus of first and second-class wards to benefit the common people, but unfortunately there are very few.</p>
<h3>On Charitable Hospitals</h3>
<p>— Ruan Shangcheng</p>
<p>The establishment of hospitals is to treat people with diseases and, further, to seek ways to prevent diseases, so that people in the society can be healthy and reach old age. Therefore, if a hospital cannot seek ways to prevent diseases, nor can it treat people who already have diseases, then having a hospital is equal to not having a hospital. What's worse is that if a hospital is poorly managed, it will make healthy people sick, and those who are sick but can be saved will become incurable. The more hospitals there are, the more harm they will do and the more people they will kill. The original intention of establishing a hospital was to save people, but the result is the opposite. This is truly saving people but becoming a killer.</p>
<p>There are many hospitals in the country. In terms of their origin, some are funded by the government, some are raised by public donations, and some are donated by individuals. In terms of content, some are large-scale and well-equipped, some are simple and perfunctory, and some are neither here nor there and have no equipment. The good and bad are different, and it is difficult to discuss them all. Today, I will only talk about the hospitals established by philanthropists. Because the original intention of charity is to save people and not to put profit first, I can speak out and seek improvement.</p>
<p>Since Chinese people gradually learned about science, new medicine has emerged and gradually gained the trust of society. Those with charitable hearts often generously donate to establish hospitals, hire new doctors, provide free medical treatment and medicine to help the poor. Their intentions and deeds are indeed excellent. However, founders may not all have a considerable understanding of science. In view of the current backward state of science in our country, there is no need to hide it. Therefore, the hospitals they create will inevitably be difficult to be perfect. This is because their management methods, the people they choose, and the content of the equipment are all unable to determine their choices with a scientific perspective. Now, let me briefly discuss the three key points of management methods, selection of personnel, and content. I don't know if my humble words are also worth adopting.</p>
<p>(1) The power of hospital management should belong to the doctor in charge of the hospital, or the doctor who is also the director of the hospital. Modern medicine is completely based on science. Without considerable scientific knowledge, it is impossible to understand it. Medicine is progressing day by day, and the techniques used in practice are becoming more sophisticated and complex. The equipment is strict and management strives to benefit patients, and is not tired of improving it every day. It is not like the old doctors who get a piece of paper and a pen and can treat people anywhere. Therefore, modern hospitals should all be entrusted to doctors. It is a big mistake to regard the hospital as a clinic for old doctors, where everyone can manage it. The establishment of a hospital is based on science. All the staff in the hospital, including nurses, administrative staff, accountants, and even servants, must receive considerable scientific training. As for the construction of houses and the equipment in the hospital, needless to say. The common disease of hospitals at present is to divide hospital work into two categories: medical affairs and administrative affairs, and to place the powers of the two categories in the same position. The power of administrative affairs is entrusted to people who do not know what science is, which leads to doctors treating their diseases and administrators managing their affairs. Doctors and nurses often feel that the work of administrative staff is unsatisfactory everywhere. Even if they give advice, they always feel that they are wasting their breath. And administrative staff are unwilling to listen to the doctor's command because they are in the same position as the doctor. As a result, there are disagreements between medical and administrative affairs, and hospital work is becoming increasingly worse. There are even administrative staff who are dissatisfied with the doctor's treatment methods and prevent them or participate in non-scientific opinions, which is ridiculous. As a result, doctors cannot give full play to their strengths, and their effectiveness in treating diseases is greatly reduced. As a result, patients gradually lose their faith, and the reputation of the hospital is deteriorating day by day. Whose fault is this? The trivial matters of the hospital, such as the training of the cook in the yard, the cleanliness of the wards and toilets, the distribution of medicines and equipment, and the methods of washing and storing them, are all administrative affairs, but none of them can be separated from the scope of medicine. The complexity of cleaning and washing procedures in hospitals is beyond the imagination of outsiders. Hospitals are places where all kinds of diseases gather, and there is a danger of mutual infection. If administrative affairs are not medicalized, healthy people can get sick, and sick people can get sicker. Therefore, there are no administrative affairs in the hospital, and administrative affairs are medical affairs. It is impossible to forcibly divide them into two, and it is even more inappropriate to assign administrative affairs to people who have no medical knowledge and are not trained and do not listen to commands. They often destroy the achievements that doctors have worked so hard to achieve in an instant. Therefore, hospital managers should obey the command of doctors, otherwise it will endanger the lives of patients.</p>
<p>(2) It is not easy to establish a large hospital with complete equipment. In order to suit the current environment in our country, we should try to set up more small hospitals to seek universality. However, the equipment of small hospitals should not be too simple. For example, the construction of houses, the arrangement of the interior, the purchase of medicines and equipment, and the distribution of hospital affairs should still be planned by experts. Otherwise, a lot of money is equal to a waste. Even at the lowest limit, it should be able to cope with eighty or ninety percent of the cases. Based on experience, serious illnesses that require the equipment of large hospitals are ultimately few. Otherwise, the equipment in the hospital will not be able to cope with most common diseases, which is not equal to a sham. If you only do things perfunctorily, you will mislead people even more. Therefore, the equipment of the hospital cannot be too simple, otherwise it will not be a hospital.</p>
<p>(3) The recruitment of doctors by the hospital is of great importance. What should be paid most attention to is whether the doctor has a proper background. If a doctor with a proper background costs more, and for the sake of saving money, a doctor with a similar nursing background is hired to fill the position, then the harm to the patient is even greater. This level should be entrusted to the local health authority or the medical association to select and hire on behalf of the hospital, so that there will be no mistakes.</p>
<p>In short, hospitals are not like old-fashioned nurseries and orphanages, where people without scientific knowledge can manage their affairs. If hospitals are not managed properly, they are enough to mislead people's lives. Those with charitable hearts should pay more attention to it.</p>
<h3>Medical Ethics</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>丨Points Worth Noting丨</p>
<p>Some people say that doctors only care about "skill" and not "virtue." The saying, "The Way cannot be practiced without skill," has become a set diagnosis. Can doctors only care about "skill" and not "virtue"? To understand this issue, we must first understand the meaning of the word "virtue."</p>
<p>When people stand together on the path of life, it seems that each individual, society, nation, and the world all have duties to fulfill and responsibilities to bear. How we exercise these duties and responsibilities is called "behavior." Individuals have their own individual behaviors, and groups have their collective behaviors. Behavior must have certain standards and rules. The so-called "virtue," in other words, is the standard of behavior. The standard of doctors' behavior is called "medical ethics," which is called "medical ethics" in foreign countries.</p>
<p>"Medical ethics" has become an independent science in foreign countries, but in China, no one has paid attention to it so far. If you ask people about this issue, you will definitely get a strange answer: "How can there be such a thing as ethics for doctors? How can doctors talk about morality?" Even doctors themselves do not admit that there is such a thing. What is the reason for this? In short, it is that society cannot understand doctors, and doctors cannot understand themselves.</p>
<p>Doctors should not only diagnose patients and be done with it. In terms of the nation, all health administration is related to doctors. In terms of society, all health undertakings are related to doctors. Within the doctors' own group, colleagues have frequent and close contact at all times and places. As for the lifespan and strength of the people, that goes without saying. Therefore, doctors are not only guides to the health of the people but are also the manipulators of the strength or weakness of the nation. Since the tasks of doctors are so complex and the responsibilities are so heavy, the position of doctors naturally becomes more and more important and more and more noble. The actions of doctors are naturally watched by society. How can we shirk such a major responsibility, exercise such complex tasks, and stabilize such a noble position? How can our behavior not have a proper and regulated standard?</p>
<p>In recent years, the medical profession in China can be said to have reached the peak of chaos. There are fraudulent practices that disgrace the profession, and unethical competition among colleagues. One scene after another emerges endlessly. This is because doctors have not been able to understand their responsibilities and positions, that is, there is no standard of behavior that is commonly observed. How will we remedy this chaotic situation?</p>
<p>This is indeed an important issue. Friends who care about this issue, let's study it together!</p>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Review Society is planning to publish a special issue on the study of medical ethics. Colleagues or non-colleagues who are interested in studying this issue are welcome to submit detailed discussions to the editorial department of the Medical Review Society (No. 4, Xinmin Lane, Malang Road, Shanghai), which will be published in the Medical Review in due course.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Establish a Free Syphilis Treatment Clinic</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Most people in society now know that medicine and society have a very important relationship. In particular, acute infectious diseases (seasonal epidemics) are even more related to social well-being. Therefore, many epidemic hospitals have been established. Furthermore, it is understood that the poor are most likely to contract these diseases, and great attention is paid to providing completely free treatment. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, what concerns the well-being of society is not limited to seasonal epidemics. We know that syphilis, tuberculosis, and boils are the world's three major diseases, and many people are infected with them. Regarding boils, there are still no specific methods for its cause and treatment; let's set that aside for now. The author himself worked in an epidemic hospital in his early years, where all diseases in the outpatient department were treated for free. Therefore, tuberculosis and syphilis were not uncommon. However, the general attitude is that people do sympathize with those suffering from tuberculosis, but they always feel helpless because this disease requires a long time to heal, and even the cost of medicine is not easy to bear, especially the main medicine is particularly expensive. As for syphilis, everyone thinks it is "self-inflicted harm," and even though the disease is not a pity, the patient is completely despised with moral concepts. I feel that it is very wrong to judge with a moral eye without regard to the facts, so I specially bring it up for discussion.</p>
<p>In general, a crime cannot be blamed on the individual alone. The environment is always somewhat related. Even if there is a crime, it should be based on facts. We only need to know that syphilis (in a broad sense, including all venereal diseases) is a social disease, and the number of people infected with it is as high as that of tuberculosis. In terms of transmission, it is spreading without stopping. If the person's disease is not completely cured, his descendants will suffer, and it is indirectly related to the national physique (eugenics). (Regarding the impact on heredity, although tuberculosis is possible, it is not as obvious as syphilis. Because whether tuberculosis can be transmitted to the newborn through the placenta is still a question, relatively speaking, syphilis has a deeper relationship with the health of the entire nation than tuberculosis.) So we can say: one more syphilis patient, the country and society will have endless harm; one less, there will be one more benefit. Based on this reason, the establishment of a syphilis treatment center (hospital) is an urgent matter. Here are a few other reasons, which I will now describe in detail:</p>
<p>㈠ We know that the specific drug for syphilis is Ehrlich's 606. In addition, iodine and mercury agents, as well as the newly released bismuth agents, are also effective. However, a complete cure cannot be achieved by injecting 606 once or twice. The total amount injected should be 3.0 to 4.0 grams, which needs to be divided into about ten times, lasting for about five or six weeks. However, unofficial practicing doctors always say that their medicine is particularly effective and does not require so many procedures and time. They even specially increase the amount injected each time to seek quick results, regardless of other abuses. The patients believe in this kind of doctor very much, saying that it costs less and has quick results. If they hear that they need to be injected more than ten times to be completely cured, the patients think they are being deceived. This confusion between right and wrong is certainly very harmful. We know that syphilis has a fixed number of outbreaks, and the body undergoes various changes. There are also periods of remission, almost like a complete cure. For example, in the early stage, the patient has hard chancre. This change can sometimes heal on its own without any specific drugs, but after a few weeks, systemic changes occur. This self-healing is a necessary stage, but those who are used to deceiving people will definitely say that he cured it, and the later systemic changes are due to the patient's carelessness or secondary infection. Even the patients believe it very much. Therefore, there are many patients who think that their syphilis has been completely cured, but later suffer from aortic aneurysm, tabes dorsalis, and cerebritis. Although they say that their gonorrhea is cured, they often see monoarticular arthritis, epididymitis, and cystitis. However, most patients always think that this is another disease and has nothing to do with syphilis or gonorrhea. Therefore, there are many people who suffer from syphilis and gonorrhea, but I dare say that less than one-tenth are completely cured. Although doctors know the reason for this situation, they cannot remedy it. I think only the establishment of free treatment centers can clarify the facts and let people know the way to completely cure syphilis.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Lung Disease in China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Indications for Artificial Pneumothorax</p>
<p>㈠ Severe pulmonary hemorrhage that is difficult to control, and recurrent or frequent pulmonary hemorrhage. Artificial pneumothorax relieves tension in the affected area, stopping the bleeding due to the mechanical action of force.</p>
<p>㈡ Severe unilateral pulmonary tuberculosis. All acute pulmonary tuberculosis should be treated with artificial pneumothorax immediately. Even when other treatments have been given up, this method should still be used. ㈢ Mild pulmonary tuberculosis in the early stage. If this method is used immediately, the body will be less affected by toxins, and the other lung will be mostly healthy, so it will naturally be effective in a short time. All those who have undergone ordinary treatment or long-term rest treatment without obvious effect or with a tendency to progress, and those whose economic conditions cannot bear the burden of long-term rest treatment, should use this method early in order to achieve quick results.</p>
<p>㈣ Tuberculous pleurisy: Although the secretions in the pleural cavity are surgically removed, they often accumulate again later, leaving doctors helpless. If artificial pneumothorax is used at the same time after removing the secretions, it will be twice the result with half the effort. There are many examples.</p>
<p>Although it is not easy to observe the pathological and anatomical characteristics of the lesions, if we use X-rays for precise examination, we can determine the type of pulmonary tuberculosis, which is suitable for artificial pneumothorax or not. We can see the crux of the problem and make an accurate diagnosis without any doubt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the operation of artificial pneumothorax is extremely simple, it cannot be performed by general doctors. At the same time, it must be performed with X-ray examination to be more appropriate and reliable. Therefore, it must be performed in a specialized sanatorium to solve this problem. Unfortunately, most patients are either unable to afford long-term treatment due to economic difficulties, or they cannot understand this method, so they repeatedly delay it, hoping to recover by luck. Doctors also use the patient's mentality of seeking temporary comfort and continue to perfunctorily treat them, repeatedly delaying the treatment, allowing the disease to progress, or even if it is temporarily contained, it will recur in the future. This is extremely heartbreaking. Therefore, to solve the problem of treating lung disease in China at present, the passive solution is only to popularize artificial pneumothorax treatment. Establishing more sanatoriums for lung disease in various places is the most important task today. In addition, diaphragmatic nerve avulsion, plombe, thoracoplasty, etc. are all specialized, so I will not go into detail here.</p>

<h3>The Social Mission of Doctors (2)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>The only mission for us doctors is not only to strive to save the suffering people: we should also pay more attention to the people's advance defense when they are not sick, so that they know the importance of prevention, so that they understand that most of the diseases they suffer are caused by the failure to prevent in peacetime. As to the reasons why they failed to take preventive measures in their daily lives, it is not that they did not care about prevention and avoidance. What sentient being, what community of people, does not want to enjoy the happiness of health? Who wants the harm of pain and suffering to befall them? In reality, it is because of their ignorance. Not only do they not know the principle of prevention and hygiene when they are not sick, but they also do not know how to properly deal with it temporarily after they get sick. Their current lives certainly do not give them the opportunity to seek knowledge of health preservation, and their economic ability makes them unable to obtain this knowledge. Their lack of medical knowledge can be said to be entirely due to the social environment. The lack of medical knowledge gradually leads them to not understand the way of hygiene and the benefits of physical health, and they also do not know the harm of being unhygienic to the body. Since most of the diseases in the population are known to be caused by not paying attention to hygiene and not understanding what hygiene and medical knowledge are, then if people in general can pay attention to hygiene and understand a little common medical knowledge, | | of course, this also requires the society to give them the opportunity to acquire medical knowledge and a hygienic environment | | I dare to boldly say that many diseases, especially infectious diseases that are most directly related to diet and daily life, such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, diphtheria, smallpox, plague, etc., can be avoided. How many people have lost their lives due to the harm of diseases caused by the general public's lack of hygiene and medical knowledge! The loss of such lives and the infringement of health are directly due to the general public's lack of medical knowledge, and indirectly, it cannot be said to be caused by the bad social environment. Since medicine is so important to human life, and the general public's medical knowledge is so naive, a huge gap is invisibly drawn in the middle. Therefore, in order to enable the people to enjoy the benefits of medicine, avoid the coming of disease, and achieve the goal of a happy life, it is undoubtedly necessary to break the barrier of this gap, that is, to make the people themselves aware of the benefits of hygienic knowledge to health, and the important relationship of medical common sense to the body. This work is publicity work; the responsibility of this publicity work undoubtedly lies with the doctors who are responsible for saving people and helping the world. Our Chinese people, because of such a terrible social environment and such a bad way of life, make them prone to disease, and make them unable to have the ability and opportunity to obtain hygienic knowledge to avoid disease, so as to protect their lives and preserve their health. However, on the other hand, it is also because of the lack of medical knowledge and the lack of understanding of hygienic principles that they are more likely to make their living environment worse and more degraded, and they are more likely to fall into an unhygienic and inhuman situation. This can be said to be the actual situation of the general public, especially the lower class, in our Chinese society. To relieve the suffering of the people in this bitter sea situation, the only method in our doctors' range is the publicity work mentioned above. Instill common medical knowledge into them, make them wake up, make them understand, and improve their unhygienic living environment as much as possible to avoid the infringement of diseases and maintain the health of their lives.</p>
<p>This is only in terms of the general ignorant public. Even for general intellectuals, on the surface, it seems that they should have a considerable understanding of common medical knowledge, but in reality, it is not the case. Although it cannot be said that all of them are like this, at least a large part of the intellectual class has a very indifferent view of medical knowledge, and their naivety and lack of medical common sense are unusually naive and lacking. This is probably the special situation of Chinese society. Let me give two examples to illustrate. There were two patients I knew before, who had contracted leukorrhea one after another. When they came to me for treatment, they both asked me in unison whether leukorrhea would turn into syphilis. Another intellectual with new knowledge also asked me whether enteric fever would turn into malaria. Although I cannot criticize their shallow medical knowledge from the perspective of a doctor, it is enough to show the inattention and naivety of medical common sense among the intellectual class, and especially the new intellectual circles. If the intellectuals in the new intellectual circles are like this, other circles can be imagined. It can be seen that not only the general public urgently needs the inculcation of medical common sense, but also the general intellectual circles may also need the publicity of medical knowledge.</p>

<h3>What's So Good About It?</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>Ninety-nine out of a hundred Chinese people tend to break their arms and bend them outwards. How do I know? Well, no matter how tough the Chinese are, no matter how useless the Japanese are, when all is said and done, they always say that Japan is so and so good, and China will never be able to achieve even one percent of what Japan has achieved. Forgive me, I am not worthy of being a human being. To put it bluntly, China and Japan are of the same race and culture, and they are exactly half a catty to eight taels. If you want to know the truth, please put your conscience in the middle and think about it.</p>
<p>People who live in China and sigh at China say: Since the Chinese Revolution, for more than twenty years, politics has not been on track, warlords have been rampant, and government orders cannot leave the capital. The Chinese government only knows how to increase taxes and rack its brains, without regard for the people's livelihood, causing the people to be poor and the wealth to be exhausted, arousing the wrath of heaven and the resentment of the people. No matter where you go in China, it is full of bandits, robbers, and communists. The warlords are only good at internal strife. When they see the Japanese, their legs go weak, which is really annoying to talk about. Chinese businessmen, not to mention promoting foreign goods, as soon as there is a change in the political situation, public bonds immediately plummet, shooting themselves in the foot, and they don't know what the country is. Under this kind of phenomenon, it is not fair if China is not destroyed by Japan.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. All of Japan's politics are at the mercy of the military. The cabinet is equal to a puppet, and the parliament is equal to a kind of decoration. May I ask if this is a constitutional country where politics is on track? Each Japanese citizen has to bear a national debt of eight hundred yuan. Is this not the people being poor and the wealth not being exhausted? Unstable thoughts spread throughout the country, and even the prime minister was assassinated. What are the police and the army doing? Hundreds of thousands of soldiers trembled when they saw the Northeast Volunteer Army. When they saw the Shanghai civilians, they all treated them as plainclothes to be eliminated. This is already shameful enough! As soon as the League of Nations changed its attitude, the Tokyo bond market plummeted. Even patriotic Japanese businessmen did not seem willing to dig into their pockets to maintain the market!</p>
<p>Japan and China are just like sworn brothers. Fellow compatriots who break their arms and bend them outwards, don't always say that other people's wives are better!</p>
<h3>Vase</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ningyi</p>
<p>丨Are You Willing to Accept This Title丨</p>
<p>Vase, an ornamental item, has been around for a long time. People never pay attention to it at ordinary times, unless they buy some flowers and think about putting them in it. If this vase is an antique, people will have to hide it on a high shelf and will not easily show it to others!</p>
<p>But last year, the word "vase" was as popular as a cheongsam. This word often appeared in newspapers. Does that mean the twentieth century has become an antique century? No, this vase is not a vase for flowers, but a nickname for modern women. Is it not a sin to call them by such an inanimate object in this era of high female rights? But our moralists are happily humming high tunes, saying, "They are asking for it, what is it to us?" When did S (the so-called literati of my school) also complain and write, "Woman... snake-like woman! Dressed up enchantingly, wanting to attract attention? Being insulted is the fruit they should eat..." Let's get back to the point.</p>
<p>The word "vase" entered good luck last year. Since there were female employees in the writing room, people said that they were nothing more than the manager's vases! Whether it is true or not, it doesn't matter, but this word "vase" became popular for a while. At the same time, all modern ladies were awarded this word. Ladies, are you willing to accept it? If not, I have a method to contribute.</p>
<p>This year is the year of domestic goods. Of course, all companies and shops: domestic goods are more than foreign goods, and even non-domestic goods are not sold! (In my opinion, at least this is true to its name) Then ladies, take this opportunity to also use domestic goods, wear cloth or Chinese silk and satin. The beauty of a person lies in nature, and it is useless to rely solely on the cover of cosmetics and clothing. In this way, not only will you have fulfilled your patriotic heart, but the simple clothes will also make people have nothing to criticize, isn't it the best of both worlds!</p>
<p>However, doing so has caused a disaster, because in the future, when general literati write about women, they can no longer write "Woman, this woman covered in imported goods!..." But I can't control so much!</p>
<h3>Fire!</h3>
<p>— Xu Keqing</p>
<p>Fire! What a great thing you are!</p>
<p>I think there is nothing greater than you in the world! But fire, you are not being used in the right way! Why do you burn down the thatched huts of poor vendors? Why do you destroy the homes of ordinary people? Why don't you send those rich people who refuse to do good deeds, women who like to burn incense, young people who spend money like dirt, traitors who work for tigers, and Japanese invaders who invade Chinese territory, robbers and bandits who do all kinds of evil, and scoundrels who are good at fraud, all to the fiery pit?</p>
<p>Therefore, the entire society is still not peaceful, and the entire China is still in internal turmoil!</p>
<p>Fire! Fire! I advise you! Please follow my "bitter medicine is good for the disease" advice! To realize your great work!</p>
<h3>Gender Inequality</h3>
<p>— Lily</p>
<p>丨Men Are Too Stubborn丨</p>
<p>The old man closed his eyes and kicked his legs, leaving behind thousands of silver dollars. Based on the principle of "father's property goes to the son," all of it is inherited by the son who carries on the family line. No matter if you are a married aunt, a grandmother, or an unmarried eldest lady or second lady, you are not allowed to ask about it. But if the old man left behind a pile of debt, then, based on the ancient saying of "father's debt is repaid by the son," the son who saves for a rainy day is also responsible for it. "A married daughter is like spilled water," and as a daughter, she is not responsible even to death. Men enjoy the right to inherit property and fulfill the obligation to bear debt. You can't find a more appropriate principle even if you run all over the world. But now men and women are both talking about equality. But when we open the newspaper, we only see lawsuits of women demanding to share inheritance with their brothers, and we have never seen cases of men demanding that their sisters share their parents' debt. I don't know the law very well, and I don't know if there are regulations on debt inheritance. But I think that in order to support women's rights, men should quickly give some of the debt to their aunts or grandmothers, and must not swallow it all.</p>
<p>There is another problem. Now women are gradually becoming professionalized. No matter what, they all love to talk about "freedom" and "liberation." These nice-sounding terms were originally exclusively enjoyed by men who oppressed women and were responsible for family economics. Now women are "liberated," and women have "freedom." Women can seek employment on their own, divorce their husbands, and everything is equal. Men also do not have the unequal right to "oppress women." But for the matter of "bearing the economic responsibility of the family," men and women are still unwilling to let go, which is extremely barbaric. You see, the newspapers are full of news about wives suing their husbands for being unwilling to support them, and there have never been cases of husbands suing their wives for not fulfilling their family's economic responsibilities. Isn't this enough to prove that men are unwilling to be equal to their wives?</p>
<h3>Such a Landscape</h3>
<p>— Lakeside Leisure</p>
<p>丨Spring News from the West Lake丨</p>
<p>The plum blossoms on Gushan Mountain were taken over by the heavy snow at the end of winter, taking the victory in the hearts of tourists. They seemed to have suffered a great humiliation and always remained in bud.</p>
<p>For many holidays, young men and women, relaxing, set off from the lakeside three or four times to visit them thousands of miles away, but they were still hiding in the armpits of the old, black branches, slightly revealing a few small crimson spots, shyly refusing to allow the group of confidants who had made a special trip to visit them to feast on their beauty.</p>
<p>However, the young men and women who love to jump and laugh are no longer interested in the continuous snowflakes. The red peach blossoms and green willows on Su Causeway and Bai Causeway are also eager to try to unfold their beautiful corollas. I think the plum blossoms that are acting coy and refusing to come out easily will never give up the opportunity to be embraced by ten thousand people and longed for by ten thousand people, and will soon sit brilliantly on their throne!</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>The Fire of Youth</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Kaijun felt it was his duty to teach her with utmost sincerity, hoping she could realize her ideals and achieve her aspirations. Even if it meant spending some time, it would be a good deed done. However, he was surprised to find that her family members not only did not appreciate his help, but were also somewhat uneasy, whispering among themselves. Fortunately, Kaijun's usual conduct had given no cause for criticism, and his mother's supervision was also present, so no serious accusations were made.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and after a few months, Kaijun became somewhat dissatisfied. Although she claimed she was determined to study, she often skipped classes. Her progress was slow and inconsistent, and she had not even finished a third of a book. Was this what Kaijun had hoped for? Moreover, he discovered that she had been writing letters frequently lately, and would ask Kaijun about words she couldn't write. Kaijun thought she had few friends, so why such frequent correspondence? He also heard rumors that she had recently made some new friends of the opposite sex, hence the many letters. There's no smoke without fire, and Kaijun couldn't help but be suspicious. However, he had no right to interfere and politely refrained from saying anything. Yet, he didn't want her to stray from the right path because of a little knowledge, which was a source of concern for Kaijun.</p>
<p>Summer arrived, and she started studying in the morning. However, one day, Kaijun had to go out early in the morning and didn't return until evening. He took a bath, put on a short silk shirt, and sat in the courtyard to enjoy the cool air, holding a palm-leaf fan. Suddenly, he saw her walking gracefully towards him with a book in her hand, saying, "If you're not busy now, could you teach me a lesson? I've memorized all the new words from yesterday." Kaijun wanted to relax and enjoy the cool air, and didn't want to go under the lamp to do his lessons, but he couldn't refuse her earnest request and nodded in agreement. So, they both went into the study. Kaijun turned on the electric lamp on the desk, and she sat opposite him. At that moment, Kaijun noticed something different about her. She was wearing a light pink-trimmed, white gauze blouse without a collar, fully exposing her snow-white neck. The sleeves were also short, ending above her elbows. Her prominent breasts were clearly visible in the lamplight, and the two dark, checker-like nipples were so alluring. Because her blouse was very short, her pant waist was also exposed, and a pink silk ribbon was tied to her light blue silk pants, hanging to one side. These colors had great magic, almost preventing the honest Kaijun from looking straight at her like Liu Zhen. Furthermore, he could smell a sweet fragrance, which was undoubtedly coming from her.

<p>The Women's Paradise</p>
<h3>Women's History</h3>
<p>— Qinqin</p>
<p>"Should women have existed first in the world, or men?" This question seems as impossible to answer as "Which came first, the chicken or the egg?"</p>
<p>Although the Old Testament says that God created Adam first and then Eve, this statement cannot be taken as proof.</p>
<p>Let's examine Chinese history, with a few simple examples:</p>
<p>Shui Jing Zhu: "All eleven rulers of the Dibi clan were women."</p>
<p>Shan Hai Jing: "There are ten gods called Nüwa."</p>
<p>"The mother of the Yellow Emperor was Fubing, who saw a great lightning bolt encircling the Northern Dipper, and the pivot star illuminating the wilderness, and was moved, and conceived for fourteen months, and gave birth to the Yellow Emperor at Shou River." See Emperor's sacrifice.</p>
<p>We Chinese people all claim to be descendants of the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor's mother conceived after being moved by lightning and a pivot star, so the ancestor of us Chinese people should be female.</p>
<p>As for women being able to conceive alone, there are many examples to cite. Now, let's mention a well-known example:</p>
<p>Everyone who reads the New Testament knows that Mary was a virgin who was moved by the Holy Spirit and gave birth to Jesus Christ. This is a common point between East and West, an undeniable piece of evidence.</p>
<p>Some may consider the above to be historical myths.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the word "surname" (姓). Broken down, it is composed of the characters "woman" (女) and "born" (生), so it is undoubtedly the case that since the beginning of surnames, our ancestors were female.</p>
<p>Just as the descendants of the Yellow Emperor all have the surname Ji (姬), the character Ji also has the "woman" radical, and we never see surnames with the "man" radical, and even words with the "man" radical are very rare. Based on the analysis of the characters, it seems that we can prove that women existed first in history.</p>
<h3>The Most Fashionable Hairstyles This Year</h3>
<p>The hairstyles of the leading movie stars in Hollywood, USA, have four new styles in 1933. These four styles have been very fashionable in recent days, and women in general social circles are imitating them. Now I will introduce them to the fashionable women of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The first is the Greta Garbo style. This style was newly created by Irene Dunne of M. &amp; M. Company, in which the hair covering the ears is curled very strangely, and the tips on both sides form a large wheel. After this lady came up with this style, she decorated it very well, and it was approved by the general women. It is said that a young man who is good at flattering even spent 20,000 yuan to publish an advertisement to praise her beauty, which attracted the attention of the society.</p>
<p>The second is the Brie Miller style. This was created by Joan Crawford. The hair is combed to the left and right in the middle of the top of the head to cover the ears. The back of the head is slightly shorter than the neck, like a duck's tail.</p>
<p>The third is the Joan Blondell style. This is Miss Van Vlyer's hairstyle. The hair is combed to the right, and the hair on top gradually goes down and is permed into a spiral shape, like clouds covering the forehead. The hair on both sides of the ears is close to the ears.</p>
<p>The fourth is the Sue Carol style. This was first invented by Miss Bickford Milton. The hair is combed backwards, and the sides of the head are permed into soft finger-ring shapes and decorated with flowers, but one-third of the ear is exposed below the ear.</p>
<h3>Short Coat</h3>
<p>— Ju Yun</p>
<p>This is one of the new short coats. Black or brown plain satin or woolen fabric is the most suitable for the fabric;</p>
<p>A round collar with pure white long hair is particularly beautiful. The waistband is tied with light-colored silk braids, which are tied into double coins or butterfly knots, which are novel and pleasing.</p>
<p>If a round collar of yellow fox fur is attached to white plain satin, although it is also bright and eye-catching, it is not as durable as black or brown.</p>

<p>Economic Special</p>
<h3>Dumping of Russian Goods and Economic Aggression</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>In the first five-year plan of Soviet Russia, the output of materials such as fuel, oil, wood, and fur sold well in the world market, and similar products from other countries were squeezed out. This is because the sales of Soviet Russia do not take into account the cost, which is different from the cost standards of other countries. Only by not taking into account the cost, can it be possible to sell at a lower price, and the market price will fall without limit, and the panic cannot be recovered. The dumping of Russian goods abroad is intended to promote world revolution, and how can it not contain the role of economic aggression? Therefore, there are those who defend it, saying: The Soviet Union is implementing the five-year plan, and is striving to revitalize heavy industry and is short of machinery and materials, so it has to exchange what it has for what it lacks. By suppressing the surplus of consumption, it takes the thirst-needed products. If it is not willing to cut prices with tolerance, I am afraid it will be difficult to fulfill the wish. The method of dumping is out of necessity, and there is absolutely no meaning of aggression in it. Moreover, in a socialist country, production and consumption are adjusted to seek a balance between the two; if there is a surplus of consumption, production will be restricted, and if consumption is insufficient, production will be increased. Production is specially set up for consumption, and there is no worry about suppression. Since Russian production is not excessive, there is no need to use other countries as the tail. It can be asserted that economic aggression will never happen in Soviet Russia. It is said: That is not the case. Is the production plan of the current Soviet Russian authorities only aimed at domestic consumption? Or is it not limited to this? Their authorities are really planning to increase production year by year in the future. The output of fuel oil can exceed that of the United States; The amount of manufacturing can surpass that of Britain and Germany; the quantity of other agricultural and industrial products will surpass the advanced countries. With the vast land and abundant resources, and the continuation of work, if there are no other obstacles, what it has planned may not be impossible to achieve; if it is realized, then the products of heavy industry and direct consumer goods will be abundant. Will the surplus be turned out to exchange for what it lacks? Then the country has everything, and there is no need to change everything. Even if there are things that need to be supplied from abroad, only a very small number of goods. Will the consumer be allowed to take and demand, without restriction? Then the products of heavy industry are not for direct consumption; direct consumer goods have a fixed amount of needs. For example, everyone can have two or three pairs of leather shoes; there is no need to have ten or eight pounds of bread every day. Will the surplus be swallowed up and stored in public warehouses for unexpected needs? The need for contingencies cannot be denied, but there is also a certain limit. Beyond this limit, it is a pity to put useful things in useless places, and the goods in the warehouse are allowed to rot. Will the work be reduced, or will the work force be transferred to positions outside of real industry? The jobs outside of real industry are limited, and is there enough room for them to be accommodated? Therefore, it is necessary to use the skills of deceiving people; to sell and win the products; to prevent the decay of the warehouse; it is almost impossible to solve this problem without selling all the surplus abroad. If so, is the future foreign trade of the Soviet Union any different from those capitalist countries that seek to export more? Is there no difference? In today's world, the national boundaries have not been eliminated, and the ethnic boundaries have not been broken. No matter what kind of economic system a country implements, it must take its own interests as its base. How can there be people who work hard day and night to develop industry, aiming to surpass the production of other countries, and not seek to expand economic power to the country? Moreover, the Soviet Union's agricultural and industrial enterprises are striving for mechanization, and claim to eliminate capitalism, and strive to imitate the production methods of capitalism, for fear of being unseemly. The only difference is that in other countries it is private capitalism, while in the Soviet Union it is state capitalism. The speaker said: "Imperialism is conceived from capitalism;" If this statement is reasonable, then no matter what kind of capitalism it belongs to, it can conceive imperialism.</p>
<h3>Controlled Economy and Planned Economy</h3>
<p>— Wang Yutong</p>
<p>Since October 1929, due to the drastic changes in Wall Street in the United States, the economic situation of the world has suddenly turned bad, and it has been followed by an unprecedented panic. Because of its profound impact, it is obvious that there is overproduction, low profits, increased unemployment, and difficult living conditions. This is what the general advocates of rationalization of production at that time had expected. Up to today, the aftermath of the economic panic can still be seen, and the economic state of the world is finally stable. Therefore, general economists have severely condemned the past capitalist economic organization, which is too free and unrestrained, resulting in the result of the current economic world running around and breaking through the norm. Therefore, there are policies of "controlled economy" and "planned economy", which are recognized by the current economic world as the only good medicine to remedy the economic panic.</p>
<p>The so-called controlled economy and planned economy, the meaning of these two is sometimes the same, and the purpose is nothing more than to expand the blocked path of the current capitalist economic organization; the common point of the two is to restrict the current economic organization of free competition, and to suppress its activity, so that the interests of all countries are attributed to the interests of the subject. However, we observe that there are differences in the definitions of controlled economy and planned economy among general scholars. The former is only a method of trying to regulate the state to relieve the current state of economic panic, and to suppress the power and activity of some existing capital, in order to plan the development of the whole economic world. As for the planned economy, it regards the current capitalist free economic organization as a fundamental error, and earnestly denies it. At the same time, it conducts a new planned organization in the economic world, and then acts. In other words, the controlled economy is a method of correcting the current state of the economic world, and the planned economy is to abandon the current economic organization and reorganize a different economic world.</p>
<p>If we want to seek the controlled meaning of the controlled economy, we can take the interpretation of industrial control by the Japanese Ministry of Commerce last year as an example. Its text said: "The mission of the law on the control of heavy industry is to give it appropriate rules and regulations to eliminate the source of its instability, improve various industries, and place them on a solid foundation, in order to plan the prosperity of the national economy; On the one hand, in order to control the heavy industry, it is necessary to make all industries subject to the control agreement, and those who abandon the control shall be ordered to comply with the control regardless of whether they have joined the agreement or not. On the other hand, the government shall implement supervision for the sake of protecting public interests, and if it believes that the agreement violates public interests or harms the fair interests of other industries, it shall order it to be cancelled or changed." As for the interpretation of planned economy, the Japanese economist Masataro Yamaguchi recently stated in his article "The Principles of Planned Economy": "The so-called planned economy is to carry out planned control in a deeper place in addition to the already implemented business. This is not just a comprehensive effort in economic life. It is not enough to call it a planned economy if it only involves the control of a part of the production industry." If we observe the above two clear explanations, we can gain a better understanding of the distinction between controlled economy and planned economy.</p>
<h3>Reading the Draft of Food Management Policy</h3>
<p>— Fa</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the great panic of public food, there are also many researchers and discussions on the food problem, but there are not many who can see the essence of the food problem in our country, and analyze it clearly. The draft food management policy of the Ministry of Interior was disclosed in the newspapers the day before yesterday. Although it is still waiting for the day to be promulgated and implemented, it is also the crystallization of the discussion on the food problem for many years. Looking at the draft in general, it can be said to be precise and detailed, and it is especially gratifying that it reverses the previous government's attitude of ignoring the food problem.</p>
<p>The draft law is still to be revised and has not yet been finalized, so there is no need to comment on it item by item. Although it is foolish to gain one, the reporter himself believes that there are several important points about the food problem that are worth referring to by the authorities, so he wrote it down here.</p>
<p>In general, the food problem in our country today is extremely complex and involves a lot. As it is said in the draft, "It is also considered that food management is not only an economic policy, but also a national defense policy. All facilities should be carried out in conjunction with military, land, water conservancy, transportation, health, finance and other policies. It is also a matter of encompassing all things." In short, its causes can be divided into two aspects: production and trade.</p>
<p>In terms of production, there are several factors that have caused today's food panic: First, local military and police forces, for the sake of fiscal revenue, force and encourage farmers to plant opium, which is a fatal blow to food harvesting and planting. Second, since the invasion of capitalism, capitalist countries have greatly forced changes in the planting of agricultural products in our country in order to seize industrial raw materials. For example, in places where rice and wheat are originally planted, they often change to plant raw materials such as cotton, tobacco, and medicine to increase income, which has a great impact on the reduction of food production. Third, land is increasingly subdivided, and there are more and more fragmented land cultivations, coupled with the prevalence of the lease system, which are all factors that reduce food production. Fourth, small farmers are increasingly in trouble, and production tools are becoming increasingly inferior, which also has a great impact on the reduction of food production.</p>
<p>However, the food problem is not so simple. In addition to production, there are also many trade relations. As the draft also mentions: "Provinces govern themselves and do not conspire with each other." It is one of its causes. The main aspects of trade are: First, the small farmers' economy is struggling, and all farmers have to borrow from grain stores or wealthy landlords and merchants, so that grain prices are often manipulated, and producers have no way to eat. Second, food hoarding and waiting for prices can often trigger food panic. Third, traffic is hindered and rice is forbidden to go out, which can affect the circulation of food. Fourth, the most important thing is the dumping of foreign rice, which often causes local rice to rot. Traitorous merchants collude with foreign merchants to transport rice abroad for monopoly purposes. All of these are the main causes of the food problem, and the increase of taxes by local authorities is also the case.</p>
<p>If the Food Management Law can be implemented as soon as possible, and it is appropriate to implement it, then it will be a non-shallow benefit to the solution of the food problem and to benefit the common people. If it only reaches the external form and is unable to do anything about the root cause of the grain, it will not only be a piece of paper, but it will also be enough to pretend to be sick. There are hopes for the public of the law.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of China's Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>— Da Zhong</p>
<p>In recent years, the national economy has declined to the extreme, and the most obvious of them is that the decline of foreign trade is too great. When the Republic of China started in 21 years, after the great flood of the previous year, Fuquan took the January 28th Shanghai War as the reason, and those who knew the current situation had long worried about the decline of trade in this year. Now that the 21st year has come to an end, the trade figures have also been released by the customs, and we cannot but be infinitely pessimistic about the results.</p>
<p>According to the monthly report of the customs and the statistics published by the International Trade Bureau, the net number of exports for the whole year of last year was 449.26 million customs taels, and the net number of imports was 100.49 million customs taels, totaling 155.418 million customs taels. Compared to the 230 million customs taels of the previous year, it fell by two-fifths, only 66% of the previous year. This decline in trade is the lowest in the past ten years, and the most noteworthy of them is the tragic decline in exports. The figure of 44.92 million customs taels is only seen in the fifteen years since the European War, more than double the highest 18 years, and only 54% of the previous year. The situation and speed of its decline are truly alarming. If we look at the composition of exports and imports, of the total trade value of 150 million customs taels last year, imports accounted for 68%, and exports accounted for only 32%, that is, imports accounted for more than two-thirds, and exports accounted for less than one-third, which is what we should pay extreme attention to.</p>
<p>The extreme reduction in export trade resulted in an unprecedentedly huge surplus. The total for the whole year was 55.56 million customs taels, which was 32.2 million customs taels higher than the previous year, more than five times higher than the first year of the Republic of China, and more than 34 times higher than the lowest surplus during the European War. The magnitude of the number can be imagined. And this surplus of 55.56 million also exceeds the total value of exports this year. This situation is not only unprecedented in the history of the country, but also unprecedented in other countries.</p>
<p>The surplus is originally an inverse phenomenon in international trade. In our country, which has no intangible income to make up for it, the inverse phenomenon is very obvious. The decrease in exports and the increase in surpluses last year, the fact that the customs of the Northeast were robbed by rebels after July, and the incomplete figures, should be an important reason. However, we must know that the trade of the Northeast customs in the first half of last year was already low. Even if the same trade in the second half of the year had complete figures, the total exports for the whole year would only be equal to 68% of the previous year, and the population would not be equal to 78% of the previous year, which is still a huge difference.</p>
<p>Then the tragic decline of trade last year was actually due to its own lack of vitality, and there is no need to elaborate on it.</p>
<p>In recent years, export trade has declined year by year, such as silk, tea and national products, all of which are lower than before. The observation of statistical figures is even more alarming. Those who are knowledgeable have long shouted loudly and tried their best to promote it. However, the result of promoting itself has reached the unprecedented tragic decline last year. The reason for the knot is that the lack of vitality of the domestic industry is the biggest reason. During the period of world economic panic, all countries have increased tariff barriers and restricted import trade. The principle of frugality and self-sufficiency is applied to foreign goods, which will have a significant impact on China's export goods. However, if we can improve the quality, improve the output, and meet the needs of the market, with the excellent nature of China's export goods in the international market, it is not hopeless to maintain the old market and compete with other countries. The tragic decline of export trade last year was very obvious, and the tendency of the decline of important export commodities was even more obvious. The crisis of China's trade has been fully expressed. If we do not quickly plan and find ways to save it, the future is unimaginable. I am afraid that in a few years, there will be no place for Chinese goods in the international market. The importance of the situation, the people of the country must not ignore it.</p>
<h3>On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Advocating High Grain Prices</h3>
<p>— Chao Gou</p>
<p>"Low grain prices hurt farmers" is an established fact, but whether high grain prices can save farmers is not easy to determine. Whether simply raising grain prices can save the rural economy and restore purchasing power is a question worth studying!</p>
<p>We know that it is not the average farm household that most needs relief, but primarily the tenant farmers and poor farmers. These farmers, oppressed by natural and man-made disasters over the years, are in the most miserable state. Even if our grain policy cannot target poor farmers as a whole, they are still the main target. At the very least, we must consider their interests because poor farmers constitute the absolute majority of farmers.</p>
<p>Let us ask: Does raising grain prices benefit these poorest of poor tenant farmers? Every harvest season, these poor farmers have to pay the majority of their grain as rent to landlords. The remainder is the bare minimum for their families' annual needs and theoretically cannot be sold. Therefore, it is actually the grain in the hands of landlords and rich farmers that is affected by grain prices. Under low prices, landlords and rich farmers are willing to feed the grain to livestock. This year's panic is actually a panic of landlords, rich farmers, and rice merchants.</p>
<p>Last year's panic was even more severe due to rural poverty, the concentration of capital in cities, and the difficulty of farmers' capital turnover. To purchase daily necessities, fertilizer, and farm tools, farmers had no choice but to borrow at high interest rates and repay with their harvest. If not, farmers also had to sell their harvest to cover this year's expenses. As a result, the portion of grain needed to sustain farmers' lives had to be concentrated in the hands of landlords and rice merchants at low prices. They were forced into this desperate situation to maintain their families, truly a case of "curing the immediate sore by cutting out a piece of the heart." This situation was particularly common in disaster areas in previous years. They borrowed money in previous years, mortgaging last year's harvest. Before the new harvest arrived, their crops already belonged to landlords and rice merchants. They now own nothing. Even if grain prices rise, how will they benefit?</p>
<p>Therefore, to save the farmers, grain prices should be raised one or two months before the new harvest comes to market. Raising grain prices later only benefits landlords and speculators who hoard grain.</p>
<p>Moreover, if we look at it from another perspective, raising grain prices is not only unhelpful but harmful. Why? As mentioned above, poverty forces a large portion of farmers to sell the grain they need to survive. They sell their produce at the lowest price while also purchasing grain as consumers. Their interests are not aligned with those of landlords and rich farmers, but rather with those of urban consumers. Since they sell their produce at low prices, they naturally want to buy consumer goods at low prices. When grain prices rise, they not only receive no benefit but also suffer from the pain of high-priced consumption, which is equivalent to increased oppression.</p>
<p>Grain consumers include the petty bourgeoisie, shop assistants, workers, and those living on fixed salaries. They do not have better lives. Rising rice prices are a major threat to their livelihoods. Some believe that rising grain prices will lead to higher wages, but wage increases always lag behind price increases. Moreover, in such a situation, there is little hope for industrial revitalization. Maintaining the status quo is already a blessing. Otherwise, labor disputes will arise, unemployment will increase, and society will become unstable. This is not a deliberate attempt to create alarm but a necessary trend.</p>
<p>Even if there is a theoretical need to raise grain prices, there are still many difficulties. The dumping of foreign rice is indeed a major cause of falling grain prices, but the pity is that some places in China have become inseparable from foreign rice. Once the import of foreign rice is banned, the price of rice in consumer areas will inevitably skyrocket as a result of hoarding by speculators. However, can the rice-producing areas supply enough? Even if transportation is convenient, taxes are abolished, and the business of rice merchants is smooth, the landlords' rice is sold at good prices. However, consumers and poor farmers in rice-producing areas suffer. Can this be considered fair?</p>
<p>Some advocate for public granaries and mortgages, but only rice merchants and landlords can use public granaries or mortgages. Poor farmers cannot benefit from them because even if farmers have surplus grain, they cannot afford to deduct interest. If they discount mortgages at market prices, they might as well sell for more cash. Moreover, all interest and expenses will inevitably be passed on to consumers. As a result, consumers suffer more, and landlords and rice merchants benefit, which is still a way to harm the people. Therefore, raising grain prices ultimately makes farmers suffer more, worsens the lives of urban consumers, and industry has no way forward because the purchasing power of rural and urban areas is reduced while costs increase.</p>
<p>The question of how to save the farmers is a complex one. I will discuss it again when I have the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Exhibition of Exhibits for the Chicago Exposition</h3>
<p>— He Bing</p>
<p>The exhibition of exhibits for the Chicago Exposition, which has been widely publicized for a long time, opened the day before yesterday (the 18th) at the Central Research Institute in the French Concession. At this time of economic depression and dire difficulties, we cannot help but feel emotional when we look back and forward:</p>
<p>Our country has participated in international expositions many times. Before the Great War, China's participation in international expositions was handled by foreign customs officers, resulting in insults to the national prestige. Those organized independently, such as the participation in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915, the Carnival and Fair in the Philippines, the Philadelphia Exposition in 1926, and the Liaodong Commodity Exhibition in the Philippines in 1929, were all planned extensively and cost huge sums of money. What was hoped for was nothing more than to take this opportunity to promote and revitalize our country's foreign trade. However, there are many elements to revitalize trade, and publicity alone cannot achieve the full effect. Therefore, our country's trade is subject to the impact of international commodity dumping externally and is hindered by war and heavy taxes internally. It is only declining and tending towards decline.</p>
<p>The nature of the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition is different from previous ones. As the conference declaration said: "This exposition focuses on scientific progress, which goes without saying." It also said: "The purpose of this conference is to focus on the progress of all countries. The entire site occupies approximately 800 acres, and countless modern buildings stand on the banks of Lake Michigan, which, even from the surface, expresses the spirit of this exposition being different from previous expositions." Chicago is one of the major cities in the United States, and the purpose of the conference is to celebrate Chicago's construction and the progress of various sciences in the United States over the past century.</p>
<p>The last hundred years can be said to be a new stage in our country's history of thousands of years, and also the most unfortunate period in our country's history. After the Opium War with Britain, the gates were opened, and the economic lifeline was controlled by imperialists. Years of war and constant disasters have made the people more impoverished and the country weaker, all of which are closely related to imperialist aggression. There is no reason for a century of progress. If there is any, it is nothing more than those who deceive themselves and others, flaunting the abnormal development of a few coastal cities and thinking that this is a manifestation of progress. They do not know that the development of coastal cities in China today is based on the depletion of ordinary rural areas throughout the country, which is also the result of imperialist aggression. Secondly, although some people can still see the decline of all industries in our country in recent years, few have the idea of fundamental relief, and only admire the past prosperity.</p>
<p>Therefore, the commodities widely collected for the exhibition are still the same as in previous ones, mainly silk, tea, Xiang embroidery, porcelain, and other things. Speaking of the past, they have a glorious history, but their situation in the past century is one of decline. Is this not a contrast to show the strengths of others? I believe that the organizers are sincerely dedicated, and I know that they have great expectations for the future of our country's trade.</p>
<p>Considering the actual situation of our country's economy, the daily necessities of people in various places are mostly supplied by others. This shows that the need to develop the domestic market is no less important than the foreign market, and the increase in foreign trade depends on the improvement of domestic industry. What is the way to develop the domestic market and develop industry? It is to clarify politics, to end wars, to eliminate bandits, to abolish harsh taxes, and to protect domestic goods against aggression. Without this, abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial will not help. Even if it is not self-inflicted, it is nothing more than working for others.</p>
<p>The exhibition of exhibits opened on the 18th. After reviewing the entire venue, we can't help but feel something besides admiring the enthusiasm of the organizers. If, as a result of this exposition, we observe and learn from each other, feel touched, and take it a step further to make efforts to treat the root cause, then this exhibition is worth celebrating, and the improvement of our country's industry in the future will also be obvious.</p>
<h3>Deliberations on the Loan Term of Farmers' Banks</h3>
<p>The loan term relied upon by farmers is always longer than that of commercial loans, no matter what, and this is because the natures of the two are different. Commercial loans are only for business turnover, while agricultural loans are mostly used for farming, without the convenience of commercial turnover, and the time cannot but be longer. However, what should be the standard for the loan term of farmers' banks? To put it bluntly, it should be determined according to the use of the loan. However, for the loan terms of all farmers' banks in China at present, the maximum term is mostly no more than two years. Of course, this term is very rigid and cramped. In my opinion, the loan terms for farmers can be divided into the following types:</p>
<p>Loans with a term of one year: For farmers to borrow funds to purchase fertilizers and seeds.</p>
<p>Loans with a term of three years: For farmers to borrow funds to purchase farm tools and cattle.</p>
<p>Loans with a term of five years: For farmers to borrow funds for land reclamation.</p>
<p>In fact, the length of the loan term also depends on the government's policies. If the government focuses on increasing the productivity of farmers, then the length of the term may not be fixed. If it is to relieve farmers of the pain of "ripe wasteland," that is, even if production is abundant, prices fall, and agricultural product mortgage loans are needed to provide relief, then even if the term is within one year, it is acceptable. In short, the policy should be determined by the government's policy.</p>
<p>Equal land rights to ensure that tillers have their land is one of the KMT's policies. However, at present, the tenant's right to cultivate is completely in the hands of the landlord. If the tenant rents this piece of land this year, he himself cannot know whether he will still be cultivating it next year. When asked about this, he only wishes for a certain income and is unwilling to think about changing it, which affects production. To solve this problem, the tiller must have his own land. If the tiller has his own land, and the means of distribution by the Land Bank is not correct, then the mission can be accomplished by the Farmers' Bank. That is, the Farmers' Bank lends to the tenant and asks him to buy land, and this land is given to the Farmers' Bank as collateral. The term can be set at ten years or more, and the repayment is made in installments. It is known that one mu of land is worth 60 yuan. If the tenant pays back in installments over ten years, then he only needs to pay 7 or 8 yuan per year for principal and interest, which is about the same as paying rent. After ten years, this mu of land will be his. This method is beneficial to both sides. On the Farmers' Bank side, because this mu of land is mortgaged to it, and the land price is constantly rising (?), the loan can be made with confidence. On the side of the land buyer, because the repayment is made in installments, there is no difficulty and no extra burden, and the land already belongs to him. (This method refers to the American BuildiogandLoanAsociarico) However, such loans are currently difficult. If it is implemented in the future, a certain amount of money will be needed, and the term will be very long. The capital of the Farmers' Bank is limited, and the issuance of bonds is not trusted by society, so it can only be used as a deliberation. How to implement it is still in the future!</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial Weekly: The Silver Dollar Market Was Listless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to it being Sunday and banks being closed, there was no market. The money market itself was also very quiet. The amount of exchange bills made in the early market was only 290,000 yuan. The transaction volume in the afternoon market was a mere 110,000 yuan. There were no transactions in banknotes in either market. However, the market price of foreign silver was 2.5 hao lower than the previous day, at 7 qian 1 fen 5 li 2 hao 7 hu and a half. The prices in the morning and afternoon markets were the same. The silver demolition in the morning and afternoon markets was also the same as the white order. It is observed that due to the Sunday holiday, there was no trading in demolition labels, about more than 5 million yuan. There were no reports of customers coming and going. Money shops received and released more than 1 million silver dollars in public orders for the first and second banks, and more than 4.1 million silver dollars in public orders for the fourth bank. The transaction volume of small money shops was more than 200,000 yuan. The price of subsidiary coins of Jiangnan small coins was the same at 6 qian 1 fen in the morning and afternoon. The transaction volume was only 3,000 jiao in the morning market. The price of Guangdong small foreign coins was 5 qian 8 fen 9 li 7 hao and a half in the morning market and 5 qian 9 fen 0 and a half li in the afternoon market. The transaction volume was 65,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were reduced by 1,000 wen, which is 419,500 wen. The transaction volume was limited, with only 9,600 taels of silver as collateral, equivalent to 40,272 strings of wen.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Bond Market Was Turbulent Last Week</h3>
<p>▲As a result, each bond fell from one yuan several jiao to three yuan zero▲</p>
<p>Last week, from the 13th to the 18th of the month, the bond market of the Huashang Securities Exchange went through a week of increasingly worse turmoil. Due to the extremely tense diplomatic issues, even though our country has won a diplomatic victory, if a war breaks out, China's sacrifices will inevitably be extremely painful. Japan is stubbornly resisting, and our country is also resisting to the end. Therefore, the diplomatic emergency has become more acute. The market's sentiment has been chaotic. On Monday, due to the purchase by the silver and money industries, the market price rose sequentially throughout the day, rising one yuan and a half. The initial opening on Tuesday still had lingering effects, with a continued increase of several jiao, and the trend was quite favorable. The second round slightly decreased. At the time of the unified salt tax, rumors that Japan would withdraw from the League of Nations and cancel our country's seaports were obtained by those who sold early. Therefore, the unified salt immediately decreased by one yuan. The news spread widely in the afternoon, and the opening price fell sharply by more than two yuan, and the closing price was still weak. On Wednesday, the opening phoenix wave was relatively stable, but one wave had not yet subsided, and another wave rose. The second round was again due to Japan's ultimatum to withdraw troops stationed in Rehe within a limited time, and the market's sentiment was even more lacking. All parties rushed to sell, and the market price fell sharply by two yuan several jiao again. Although the temporary short-covering in the afternoon head round returned to several jiao or one or two yuan, the closing price was still tiring. The market's sentiment was all depressed after this degree of stimulation. On Thursday, the rising road was seen every day, and it was relatively stable. On Friday, it rose slightly by five or six jiao. On Saturday, it returned to seven jiao jiao. Although it was relatively stable, there was a sense of irreversible decline. The future situation has many waves. First, there are still many changes in the China issue. Second, with the settlement period approaching, there are still many long and short sides competing with each other. In terms of buying and selling, Nos. 11, 32, 38 and 50 are actually powerful figures. Nos. 34 and 40 are sold by retail investors. Nos. 5, 16, 17, 21 and 11 are bought individually. The buying and selling parties are evenly matched, and there are no rifts. The result of the week was a fall of one yuan several jiao to three yuan zero. The total transaction volume was 55,106,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cotton, Foreign Cotton: American Up, British, Indian Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was active due to purchases by peers and foreign merchants. The futures price rose by 2 to 6 pounds per ton, and the spot price remained unchanged. The British cotton futures price fell by 2.1 points, and the spot price remained unchanged. The Egyptian cotton spot price fell by 4 points. The Indian cotton market was initially weak due to resales by European exporters, sales by speculators, and profit-taking by bulls. Later, it recovered slightly due to the filling of positions by some shorts. The Pingguoer fell by 1.75 rupees, the Aomura fell by 3 rupees, and the Bairoxi fell by 2.25 rupees.

<h3>Grain: River Lower Rice Continues to Rise by One Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources Nos. 30 and 40 were sold to urban and rural shops. Because the Suzhou-Tong clan had intercepted rice boats, it is said that this turmoil is different from last year's. It is said that the interception is being carried out simultaneously in Minhang in the south and Huangdu in the north. Although the purpose is unloading, there may be other effects. At present, interception has been implemented in the Minhang area, but it is not very serious. Night and wheeled tractors can still come to Shanghai, but it cannot be resolved in a short period of time. Therefore, shop customers intend to purchase Suzhou-Tong and South Port rice. The market price has risen by one jiao. On the bao-wei side, I heard that this news also has inquiries, but they are not willing to start a large-scale operation without verification. Therefore, only 700 or 800 shi of cargo on the wharf have been mobilized. Qingjiao gang's early rice is in a good position in the market, and prices are stable except for those that change to yuan, yin yuan, high loans, and pretty colors. The middle price is high, and the price changes to general slack. The market situation is soft, and the price is slightly jiao Xu. The Du Yangjian market has no honor or disgrace.</p>

<h3>Metals: Antimony Market, Iron Market Present a State of Leisure</h3>
<p>Hunan pure antimony, due to purchases by the export gang, coupled with a shortage of arrivals, the standard is flying high, the price per ton is as high as 270, and those who purchase slower sigh that there is no goods to buy. In recent days, the market has suddenly presented a state of leisure. The reason for this is the impact of the enthusiastic arrival of goods from Hunan. Moreover, its main force is also taking a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in weak market sentiment and soft prices. The current estimate is 263-4 taels, and transactions are only sporadic.</p>

<h3>Chinese Hands and Feet</h3>
<p>— Gao Ming</p>
<p>I recently read an article in a Japanese magazine about a French scholar's research on Chinese hands. It was said that the French scholar studied the hands of people from various countries around the world and discovered that the fingertips of Chinese people have the greatest adhesiveness. In other words, when touching a coin, the Chinese person's hand picks up the most grime from the coin. Following this account, the Japanese added their interpretation, suggesting that Chinese people can't be trusted with money; any money passing through their hands will be embezzled. Presumably, that's the reason for the adhesiveness.</p>
<p>The fact that they're applying biological explanations to the Chinese people's love of money really makes one prostrate oneself in admiration of the Japanese.</p>
<p>If Chinese hands have such characteristics, then what about their feet? I bet you that before long, someone will conduct a similar detailed study on Chinese feet and discover that they are slippery. Chinese people commonly call Westerners "straight-legged devils," implicitly boasting about their own nimble feet. But that's not the point. The reality is that Chinese feet are the most agile. A crowd of people may be gathered on the street, but as soon as they hear that the foreign enforcers are coming, they scatter at an astonishing speed. It's no exaggeration; the speed is truly alarming. This time, when the Japanese captured Shanhaiguan, the news spread to Beijing and Tianjin, and the trains heading south were immediately packed with refugees. Later, it was said that tickets had to be booked a week in advance. It was quite a spectacle. Of course, this is just a small example of the agility of Chinese feet.</p>
<p>The descriptions of ostriches in zoology books are quite comical. It's said that ostriches are good runners, but when pursued, they often run to a spot and bury their heads in the ground, thinking they are safe. Of course, I'm not saying that Chinese people are like ostriches. Because Chinese people have always likened themselves to lions.</p>
<h3>On Airplanes Saving the Nation</h3>
<p>— Li Danshan</p>
<p>Airplanes, airplanes! Having experienced the power of these contraptions, we have seen various expressions of "saving the nation with airplanes." Whether the current methods and future achievements will yield truly satisfactory results in terms of efficiency remains to be seen. But this is, after all, something that should shame those who draw large salaries or live comfortably in retirement. However, this trend is becoming increasingly common, with no shortage of people promoting it. As a result, some discussions are almost "polite"—or, in the popular parlance, "emotional." However, is this expression itself a bad thing? We can guide this "politeness" towards "righteousness," towards "noble spirit," but we must not let it turn into "cold air." We can actively offer advice, but we must not passively engage in cynical mockery.</p>
<p>In the short and long commentaries in the *Huanian Weekly* of January 11, one piece titled "A Little Common Sense in the Sound of Airplanes Saving the Nation" begins by asking, "Where are the hundreds of airplanes in the Northeast?" implying that "without ambition and ability, it's all in vain." Certainly, this "in vain" is correct, correct, and truly correct. But I wonder what we should do if we have ambition and ability but no airplanes? It's clear that spirit—ambition and talent—and material resources—airplanes and fuel—must be equally important. Therefore, the *Huanian* editor's words are correct when directed at the Northeastern Air Force of last year, but they are flawed when directed at the air force currently being developed, especially when placed before Mr. Tang Youren's statements.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang's main points: (1) If each county in the country buys one airplane, the waste could bankrupt the nation. Moreover, without pilots, even a large number of airplanes would be useless. (2) Science is constantly evolving. If we don't have a comprehensive plan for innovation, all the airplanes will become obsolete in two or three years. (3) Japan's ability to win depends on its strong army and navy; otherwise, the airplanes will ultimately be unable to fly.</p>
<p>According to (1), in light of the current financial situation, we shouldn't buy airplanes. (2) suggests that given the progress of science, we shouldn't buy airplanes either. (3) says that considering the strength of the army and navy, we still shouldn't buy airplanes. As a result, his meaning is as clear as it could be: we need a comprehensive plan, a scientific foundation, and the support of the army and navy. However, given Mr. Tang's position, merely making such empty pronouncements is suspicious.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Tang is someone who believes in focusing on real political power, and since he has such rational—that is, anti-emotional—views on saving the nation with airplanes, why doesn't he take the lead in planning a comprehensive project that unites the navy, army, science, and finance? He could positively support this grassroots movement to save the nation with airplanes, rather than just issuing such theoretical but impractical statements to visiting reporters, leading people to see him as offering negative criticism. Furthermore, aren't all army equipment wasteful? Doesn't it all rely on scientific innovation? Doesn't it all depend on the support of other branches of the military? Why doesn't Mr. Tang comment on those? Is it because saving the nation with airplanes is a grassroots movement, while everything in the army is run by the government? When it comes to this, I think Mr. Tang would have a hard time justifying himself.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Tang's motives may still be seen as "a gentleman's mistake." However, we must not do anything that "spoils the mood" of the movement to save the nation with airplanes. Therefore, I hope that commentators will not fall into the trap of cold-hearted calculation and selfishness in the name of "reason" or "common sense," giving those who ought to feel ashamed an excuse and harming the cause of airplanes itself!</p>

<h3>The Black Girl Seeks God (5)</h3>
<p>— Shaw, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"My desire reaches far," said the black girl. "It is wrong to close one's eyes. My longing for the knowledge of God is more intense than my desire for happiness or hope. God is my happiness and my hope."</p>
<p>"And if you discover that God does not exist, what then?" said the youth.</p>
<p>"If I did not know God existed, I should be a bad woman," said the black girl.</p>
<p>"Who told you that?" said the youth. "You should not let people bind up your heart with such limitations. And why should you not be a bad woman?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said the black girl. "To be a bad woman is to do what you ought not to do."</p>
<p>"Then you must understand what you ought to do, and that will enable you to understand whether you are a good woman or a bad woman."</p>
<p>"That is true," said the black girl. "Yet I know that even if being good is a bad thing, I ought to be a good woman."</p>
<p>"That speech has no sense in it," said the youth.</p>
<p>"Not your sense, but God's sense," she said. "I want that sense; and I feel that if I get it, I shall see God."</p>
<p>"What do you know of what you can see?" he said. "My counsel to you is to do with all your might everything that comes to your hand while you can do it, and to fill the days that are left to you before the inevitable end with usefulness and honor; for at that end there will be neither counsel nor work, neither knowledge nor doing, not even being."</p>
<p>"When I am dead, there will be a future," said the black girl. "If I cannot live in it, I can at least know it."</p>
<p>"Do you know the past?" said the youth. "If you do not know the past that has actually happened, how can you hope to know the future that has not yet happened?"</p>
<p>"But that will happen; of that I am quite sure; I can even tell you that the sun will rise tomorrow." said the black girl.</p>
<p>"That also is vanity," said the young philosopher. "The sun is burning; and one day it will burn itself out."</p>
<p>"Life is all a flame that burns itself; but every time a child is born, life lights its fire again. Life is greater than death, and hope is greater than despair. I will do the work that comes to my hand if I know it is a good work; and to know that I must know the past and the future. I must know God."</p>
<p>"You mean you must be God," he said, looking hard at her.</p>
<p>"As far as I can," said the black girl. "Thank you. We young ones are clever creatures: I have learnt from you that to know God is to be God. You have strengthened my soul. Before I leave you, tell me: who are you?"</p>
<p>"I am Koheleth, the preacher who is known to many people as Ecclesiastes," he replied. "If you find God, may God be with you! He is not with me. Learn Greek: it is the language of wisdom. Farewell."</p>
<p>He made a friendly gesture and passed on. The black girl walked in the opposite direction, thinking more intently than ever: but the thoughts he had provoked within her became so bewildering and difficult that at last she fell asleep. She walked in her sleep until she smelled a lion, which, suddenly waking, she saw sitting in the midst of her path, sunning himself like a cat on a hearthrug: one of those lions called Maneaters, because they have neat and beautiful manes, instead of shaggy draggled ones.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dick," she said, slightly patting him on the nose as she passed him, her fingers feeling as if they were stroking a warm tuft of green moss on a mountain.</p>
<p>(Note) Dick is a term of endearment for a donkey.</p>

<h3>Farewell to Shaw</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The fact is that our newspapers and magazines were buzzing for several days because of Shaw's visit to Shanghai. Everyone welcomed him. There are many reasons to welcome him, because he is a playwright who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, because he is a self-proclaimed theorist of socialism, and most importantly, because he is a master of witty language. There is no doubt that humor is most popular in China today.</p>
<p>However, an ignorant person like myself could not find a reason to welcome him for a while and dared not join in the excitement. But now that he has left "terrible Shanghai" and is sitting on the Sea Palace, listening to the beautiful sounds of cannons, I will send him off amid everyone's cheers and excitement.</p>
<p>Of course, many enthusiastic people can obtain sufficient knowledge of Shaw's previous remarks and writings from specialized publications that do their best to provide introductions, so there is no need to be repetitive. I will only briefly understand his conversations in Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw's knowledge is extensive, isn't it? Mr. Shaw's character is great, isn't it? He also boldly taught our Chinese youth to engage in "red revolution." Only an old man like him would dare to lightly utter such remarks, which are "unsuitable for China's national conditions." This is probably because he is a subject of the British Empire and not an ordinary Chinese person. But this is also his lesson from experience, which is why he is now a 77-year-old man who has not become a "fossil" or "fallen behind." Therefore, he is indeed as profound and great as most people praise him. However, some people have criticized him, saying, "As long as you make a name for yourself in society, as long as you don't become a fossil, as long as you don't fall behind," then "the value of the ideology itself has little to do with one's own future." From this, we can see that it is really not easy to speak. However, Mr. Shaw is not a radical revolutionary after all. As he repeatedly stated the day before yesterday, he does not "urge students to beat the police in the streets," and he "opposes strikes" because "the result of strikes will inevitably be freezing and starvation." Excellent words! Therefore, we can be bold and reassured that Mr. Shaw is by no means a promoter of "red revolution," nor is he intentionally coming to China to advocate revolution. He is only talking about it because he has been welcomed and cannot help but say a few words.</p>
<p>As for his praise of the Soviet Union, that is only his personal opinion, and it is not necessary for China to "learn from" it. However, his reply to the Russian reporter, "If you return to your country today and can still escape," is a terribly cold statement. Furthermore, his statement that "the Lytton Report can be called fair" is even more famous. However, our scholars are no longer concerned about its "excessive length" and have even "thoroughly" "read" the "entire" report, so they also believe that it "can be called fair."</p>
<p>Now this old man has left in haste because "Shanghai is very bad," perhaps to go to Qinhuangdao to "respectfully welcome the arrival of World War II." His hurried departure cannot help but disappoint those who welcomed him. However, the lessons he has given us are worth "contemplating day and night" for us young people. Go then, Mr. Shaw, let him go. He is already so old and of course powerless to help the future of China. I respectfully offer my sincere farewell.</p>

<h3>*Xijiang Yue* [Moon over the West River]</h3>
<p>— Chen Peizhi</p>
<p>Since ancient times, heroes are short-lived, and famous generals are amorous. How long will the revelry and slow dances last? Just endure the hatred for your father.</p>
<p>You have abandoned a great city, and still say, "Why should I care?" A white flag locks the river. It is unbearable to look back at the land of the foreign invaders.</p>
<h3>Butterfly</h3>

<p>Slowly fluttering butterfly in the flowers,</p>
<p>Fragrant whiskers brushing against the sunny rain.</p>
<p>For whom do you lament your ill fate?</p>
<p>Pitying you for being so amorous.</p>
<p>Drunk in the pollen-filled flower chambers,</p>
<p>Startled by the willow curtains, stealing fragrance.</p>
<p>If the Eastern Emperor had the power,</p>

<h3>Written for "The Son of a Problem Rickshaw Puller"</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The son of a rickshaw puller "studies" in the dreams of the rickshaw puller's hopes, so that he will have a day when a rickshaw is pulled by others. Of course, pulling a rickshaw and having a rickshaw pulled for you are as disparate as ten yuan and three hundred ninety thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Speaking of "studying," the saying "ten years under the window" comes rushing out of one's throat. The reason why people in Shandong hope for the birth of a "true son of heaven" lies here. The Emperor's three hundred ninety thousand yuan prize is hung up high, and the hard work of "ten years under the window" is the capital for buying lottery tickets. Although there is only one "scholar" every three years, the "second runner-up," "third runner-up," and even "jinshi" and "juren," and even if one takes ten thousand steps back and becomes a poor "scholar" in a village, he can still hold a water pipe and hum "to learn and practice" to support himself with a cold bench.</p>
<p>The son of the rickshaw puller only graduates from "junior high school," hundreds of thousands of miles away from "senior high school," "university," and "overseas study"; it is like a friend who wants to get rich but has no capital and saves two cents for two meals to buy a joint lottery ticket with others. If he wins, he is like someone who refuses to "condescend" to his own "expensive stall" after graduating from "junior high school," unable to put up a stinky "front." If he doesn't win, he loses both people and money (son and clothes 丨 see the son of the rickshaw puller), starving and tightening his pants.</p>
<p>Furthermore, "grumbling about one's own job," the rickshaw puller struggles in the sun, wind, rain, and snow. He only blames himself for not being "smart" and not being able to "pull a rickshaw" or "drive a car"... The son is "talented and intelligent," but the rickshaw puller also finds it difficult to "become smart" and believes that "heaven does not fail those who work hard," and he can really "make a profit" from his son. Unexpectedly, he neither "honors his ancestors" nor "gets promoted and becomes rich." Even "starting a family and establishing a career" and "marrying a wife and having children" turn into "long-term resistance." I don't know if the rickshaw puller's head has the hard-to-remember words "ten years under the window."</p>
<p>However (is it not great?), there is also a saying called "every profession produces a champion." Regardless of whether you are "talented and intelligent" or "ten years under the window," a "champion" always occupies a position in your dreams of hope. 丨 This is like the hope of winning 390,000 yuan when buying a lottery ticket. Friends who pull rickshaws, "learn from the past," study your "rickshaw pulling art," and gently guide your sons, it is not difficult to make them "rickshaw pulling doctors."</p>
<p>Reporter: "Every profession produces a champion." I am embarrassed to say again that it is like hoping to win 390,000 yuan when buying a lottery ticket.</p>

<h3>The Way Out for Divorced Women</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I, your humble servant, have lived for twenty-four years and have never fallen into the throes of love, thus experiencing no sorrows. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately?), last autumn at a friend's house, I inadvertently met a young woman. She is a pitiful, divorced woman. Her previous marriage was undoubtedly due to her parents' sole decision. Unable to endure mistreatment, she filed for divorce after only three months of marriage. Since then, she has relied on her elderly widowed mother, the two of them depending on their twenty fingers to make a living. Their difficult situation is self-evident. However, she is able to live a simple and contented life, and in these three years, she has never acted "ashamed": earning the pity and sympathy of many. Since meeting her, a deep impression has been etched in my mind. Her "endurance of hardship," "gentleness," and "competence," especially her background, all evoke in me feelings of love. At the same time, because her "personality" and "demeanor" are very similar to mine, she often expresses her love for me. Until now, our relationship has evolved from simple friendship to a mysterious "love" connection. Subsequently, we naturally feel the need to marry.</p>
<p>However, the lingering poison of traditional thinking has become an obstacle to our marriage prospects. My parents are extremely opposed to me pursuing this matter, saying that "if a man marries a twice-married (i.e., previously married) woman, it will surely be unfavorable to him." As for the specific reasons why it would be unfavorable, they cannot explain. This pedantic view is not even worth a smile, but unfortunately, it is my parents' wish, which makes me feel very difficult and painful. If I obey my parents' opinions, it seems to me, since I am a merchant without much wealth, it will be difficult to find such a satisfactory spouse again. Conversely, my parents' personalities are very stubborn, and it is difficult to gain their understanding. Can the pleasures of love not have some "bitterness" in them? Esteemed Editor, I have always admired your "wisdom" and your opinions. Please put yourself in my place and make a decision for me. (Rest of the letter omitted) Respectfully, Sun Qi Hui.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In recent years, the Chinese people have realized that a marriage in name only is not only inhumane but also harmful to both men and women. Therefore, they have gradually come to support divorce. At the same time, the "Civil Code" stipulates less stringent conditions for divorce than before. If both parties agree, they can divorce very freely. As a result, divorce cases are becoming more numerous every day. This must be considered a good phenomenon. However, the thinking of the general public is still not thorough. Some, like Sun's parents, are dominated by traditional, superstitious ideas and do not have the courage to marry a divorced woman. Some are misled by the concept of chastity, and because a divorced woman is not a virgin, they disdain to marry her. Therefore, there is no way out for divorced women. As a result, they cannot escape the following two drawbacks. ㈠ Because women, seeing that they cannot find a way out after divorce, even if there is a very good reason to divorce, they have no choice but to endure it. ㈡ Because women cannot find a way out after divorce, they have to demand huge alimony payments during the divorce. Therefore, many men, even if they have a hidden pain that necessitates divorce, do not dare to propose it because they cannot afford such alimony. Since we have realized that there is no need to maintain a marriage in name only, and at the same time, we support them divorcing decisively, we must open up a way out for divorced women, and we must break down this "superstition" and this inaccurate concept of chastity. Speaking of "superstition," why must it be unfavorable for a man to marry a "twice-married" woman? Not only Sun's parents cannot answer, but I dare say anyone would be hard-pressed to. However, marrying a "twice-married" woman, or even a "white-head wrap" (widow, which is generally considered even more unlucky), does not have a negative impact, and examples can be found everywhere. Among the past presidents of the United States, half of their wives were "white-head wraps." As for the point of chastity, it is even less of an issue. In our letter answering Mr. Chen Mengqiao on February 5th, we said, "We also know that love cannot accommodate more than one person at a time, so the exclusive thinking of both partners is considered acceptable. However, the other party's chastity before marriage seems to be lenient. It is sufficient that there is no third party involved after marriage." Moreover, a divorced woman's first marriage was also upright and aboveboard, so how can she be considered unchaste!</p>
<p>Sun's girlfriend has the three virtues of "endurance of hardship," "gentleness," and "competence," and her "personality" and "demeanor" match each other. They are indeed a rare couple. We advise you not to hesitate at all and proceed with the marriage. As for your stubborn parents, it is inevitable that they will be unhappy at first, but after a long time, when they see that there is no negative impact, they will be at ease.</p>

<h3>Scholarly Family (Continued 24)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>Zhao Erkang's son from his three wives was tragically murdered for no reason. Naturally, he was grieved. He petitioned the local officials to strictly apprehend the murderer. On the other hand, he engaged in intense negotiations with his mother-in-law, who stated: "It's only right that we be held responsible for your son-in-law's death if it occurred in your mother-in-law's house. However, he died on the street outside the door, so what does it have to do with us?" The mother-in-law was even more unreasonable, almost leading to a farcical scene of relatives cursing each other.</p>
<p>Xia Youzhong persuaded Zhao Erkang to step outside and secretly told him: Daiqiu originally intended to marry Zheng Jiping, but later, because Jiping's parents disliked Daiqiu's unfavorable horoscope, they canceled the engagement. However, Jiping remained unwilling to give up and still wanted to marry Daiqiu. Jia Dong's murder may have some connection to this matter.</p>
<p>Based on Youzhong's report, Zhao Erkang accused Zheng Jiping of murder. Since the official authorities had no leads in the case, they arrested Zheng Jiping to seek a clue. Upon being brought to court, Jiping truthfully confessed the details of his past love affair and engagement with Daiqiu and presented the threatening letter as evidence, explaining the reasons for the canceled engagement.</p>
<p>Xia Youzhong, acting in his capacity as Daiqiu's guardian, testified in court, proving that Daiqiu had always strictly adhered to the rules of conduct for women, never stepping outside her home. Except for Zheng Jiping, who often came and went at home due to family relations, she had absolutely no contact with young men, let alone a romantic relationship. Zheng Jiping's anonymous threatening letter constituted the crime of damaging Daiqiu's reputation, and its source should be investigated.</p>
<p>Zheng Jiping presented much evidence proving that he was elsewhere on the night of the murder and had no way to be in two places at once to commit the murder. However, the plaintiff argued that it was not necessary for him to commit the murder himself; he could simply hire someone to do it. Therefore, he could not escape suspicion of instigating the murder. As a result, Zheng Jiping was still detained.</p>
<p>Ever since the murder occurred, whenever Ruohua closed her eyes, she would see a bloody and disfigured son-in-law standing before her. She was extremely terrified, so she pulled Youzhong to stay at home with her. Youzhong did not leave the house for many days. One day, his servant A Hai came to find him. He hurriedly went out and talked with A Hai for an hour or two before coming back in, which aroused Ruohua's suspicion that he had another lover outside and that A Hai had come to deliver messages. She asked him what was going on, and he said:</p>
<p>"A Hai wants to ask for leave to go back home and wants to borrow three months' wages."</p>
<p>Three to five days later, A Hai came again, and Youzhong went out to talk to him again. Ruohua became even more suspicious and secretly went out to eavesdrop. They were talking in the wing room, with the doors and windows tightly closed, but the old-fashioned paper windows could not block the sound, so she overheard this part of their conversation:</p>
<p>"The reward of one hundred yuan has been paid in full. The other day, I gave you an extra thirty yuan for travel expenses. Not only have you not left, but now you're here again to borrow money, asking for fifty. This is extortion."</p>

<h3>Review of Sherlock Holmes Shown in Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Everyone knows that "Sherlock Holmes" is a character created by Conan Doyle. There have been quite a few film adaptations of this detective novel before, this is just one section of the novel. Precisely because of the novel adaptation, the structure is not very laborious, only seeking to describe the performance logically and making it tense. Then, in this regard, the film does not fail.</p>
<p>Clive Brook, who plays Sherlock Holmes, can be said to be quite competent. If he did not have such solemn movements, he would not be able to portray the characteristics of a detective. When he disguised himself as an old woman in the play and talked with the great thief, although it was necessary in the play so that the enemy could not detect it, we must at least admit that the makeup in the film is indeed unmatched by the stage play, because lighting and photography can help a lot. Ernest Tarrence's performance is also very good, his terrifying face certainly helps a lot. The others are insignificant.</p>
<p>The director also has merits in this film. Although the story is existing, he can use the beauty of shadows to make the plot more tense, but some unnecessary scenes can be omitted.</p>
<p>This is a photo of Zhang Huichong taking an anti-Japanese film on the front lines of Rehe with Commander Wang Huayi of the Second Army on the anti-Japanese front lines. It is specially published as a gift from Zhu Xuehua.</p>
<h3>Review of Camille (Resurrection of Broken Flowers)</h3>
<p>— Guo Shenghong</p>
<p>Greta Garbo's masterpiece "Camille" was shown in Carlton last year, and now it is being shown in Rongguang. Although this "Camille" is an old film, it has never been reviewed by the audience, so the author has written a short review.</p>
<p>The general idea of the plot is to depict a peasant girl who is forced by her uncle to escape into the home of an engineer. The two fall in love, with tender affection, appearing to be husband and wife. Good things take many twists and turns, and the two part ways due to some misunderstanding. After various ups and downs, the two reconcile.</p>
<p>Garbo's performance in "Camille" is indeed much better than her previous films. The plot is originally mournful and lingering, like weeping and telling, but now, performed by Garbo, the audience cannot help but shed a few tears and feel sympathy. In addition, the director's skill is very clever and the supporting roles are well-coordinated, which makes "Camille" even more outstanding.</p>
<p>The sound recording is very clear, and the dialogue is indeed more advanced than before, with every word pleasing to the ear. Several scenes of the scenery are very artistic, and several are simply not good, but this does not detract from "Camille."</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Joint Review of "Life Road" and "Full Garden of Spring Colors"</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>("Life Road") The Shanghai Grand Theater is showing the first Soviet Russian film to arrive in Shanghai, "Life Road" (The Road to Live). This publication has already introduced it in detail. However, after watching it, it is like a bone stuck in the throat, uncomfortable until it is spat out, so I will briefly talk about it again.</p>
<p>The greatest success of this film is, of course, the performance. Every move deeply strikes the heartstrings of the audience. It does not use the old etiquette of harsh words and severe expressions to teach people, it does not fail to rely on "human nature" to move forward, it only realistically describes the love of human nature, the love of the masses, the personal pain of the poor, the common sorrow under a deformed society, the necessary cooperation between the government and the people, and the responsibilities of those who understand the country to the common people... There is not a scene that does not tightly grasp the feelings of people everywhere, reflecting the fundamental cause of the collapse of capitalism. It does not have the beautiful scenery of good nights with fine wine and beautiful women, but it can also make us spiritually happy. It is not a loud appeal to promote anything, but it can also make us feel empathy. It does not have special soul power, but it can generate natural reactions in the audience's psychology. This is its greatness.</p>
<p>In this film, it abandons all concepts and naturally achieves its transcendence, revealing the mask of art and truthfully expressing the relationship and true value between art and life. It points out the "Great Road of Life" and the understanding that a person should have of "Life."</p>
<p>Modern ladies and gentlemen, you don't have to watch this film, it can't give you satisfaction, because it lacks magnificent audio-visual entertainment. What it gives you is the coldness of some economic society like an iceberg.</p>
<p>Finally! What I hope for is the arrival of the second Soviet Russian blockbuster, as a wake-up call to those who are drunk and dreaming of death in the midst of national crisis. After watching this kind of film, we will understand why art is great, the important mission that the film carries, and why the authorities in the concessions want to ban it.</p>
<h3>Amusing Anecdotes of Zoh McCurdy</h3>
<p>— Yu Lun</p>
<p>No matter how hard the main character of "Swiss Family Robinson," Zoh McCurdy, tries, he can't avoid the entanglement of women.</p>
<p>Once, he was troubled by a temporary actress. To avoid this unnecessary socializing, he said to her: "Please don't talk to me anymore, my wife doesn't like it." As he said this, he pointed to one of his girlfriends as his wife.</p>
<p>The temporary actress left, and in less than a few minutes, she ran back to McCurdy and said: "Sir, just now I saw your wife talking very intimately with Bi Hai (another man, who is that girlfriend's lover), so I know very well that she won't object to you talking to me."</p>
<p>("Full Garden of Spring Colors") This film is purely a tragedy. Originally, if the problem of "eating, drinking, and sex, the great desires of man" is not solved, there is no way to talk about anything else, and the essence of life is completely lost. It guides that love and desire are one, and finds a way out for young people who feel "sexual distress." This way out is to seek liberation regardless of all obstacles. If "the spring colors cannot be confined in the garden," you might as well abandon the criticisms of society and etiquette and have "a branch of red apricot reaching over the wall." It is important to solve immediate problems, without having to think ahead.</p>
<p>Of course, "there are no good results from enjoyment." But indeed there are many people who think that this ending of death is a perfect result of life. This film also attacks the evils of social organization. It shows that "Madame Bovary was first bound by society, so she acted beyond the rules, and society did not admit that it forced people to take this path, but instead intensified the pressure, so Madame Bovary had to be a victim under the iron hooves of society. I express my sympathy to Madame, and admire her for not yielding to the death. Indeed, how many critics receive a fall of the prodigal, whose motives, more than half, are the oppression and temptation of the environment, by depression and passive, by passive and romantic and degenerate. And no one can understand him, to explain that it is not his own sin.</p>
<p>However, the view of this film is fundamentally from a negative point of view, it takes life very loosely. And "Life Road" takes life very seriously. It points out the weaknesses of modern society, but does not know how to remedy it, but sacrifices individual lives as if they were child's play, so I say that the meaning of these two films is the same. One is passive resistance, and one is active improvement. One goes out and one comes in, the difference is too far. "Full Garden of Spring Colors" focuses on the spiritual liberation, and "Life Road" advocates the simultaneous liberation of matter, on this point, the two films also go in opposite directions.</p>
<h3>Domestic Films to Be Shown at Chicago Expo</h3>
<p>Heard that 15 films have been selected by the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The opening of the American Chicago Exposition is coming soon. According to the latest news, the Ministry of Education has sent personnel to consult with various film companies to select 15 domestic films to be screened and exhibited in Chicago. It is said that Lianhua Company occupies 12 of these, Mingxing Company occupies 2, and Tianyi Company occupies 1. Among Lianhua's films are "Struggle," "Love and Duty," "Wild Rose," etc. The others, such as those from Mingxing and Tianyi, are more ideologically acceptable. Naturally, given the immaturity of our domestic films, it is impossible to compare with the film industries of Europe and the United States. However, promoting our national spirit and status is something that should be done immediately, so we hope this matter does not become empty talk.</p>

<h3>Walking Down Broadway (6)</h3>
<p>— Qi Qing</p>
<p>"You don't have to bluff."</p>
<p>Suddenly a savior arrived. Meng Na ran in, "What are you doing here?" After speaking, she gave him a slap. Mark was confused and returned a slap. Meng Na disregarded everything and grabbed Mark's tie, dragging him out. Pan Qi rushed to the door, closed it, and locked it.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and winter comes again. The shops on Broadway are filled with Christmas gifts in the window frames, with silver powder sprinkled on the cotton. The dazzling light has changed the scene. Pan Qi had already arranged to meet Zhan Mei in front of a pharmacy on the corner of the road. Zhan Mei hurried to the appointment. Unexpectedly, when Pan Qi saw Zhan Mei, she just kept crying, which confused Zhan Mei. "Baby," Zhan Mei said, "why? People will see it and think I hit you. What did I do to offend you?"</p>
<p>Zhan Mei asked for a long time, but Pan Qi just kept crying and didn't say anything. Zhan Mei lifted her chin and saw that Pan Qi's eyes were wide open, carrying some terrible news.</p>
<p>"Eh," Zhan Mei said, "Pan Qi, is it true?"</p>
<p>Pan Qi nodded.</p>
<p>"Eh," Zhan Mei was also surprised.</p>
<p>"What to do?" Pan Qi asked.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. What's there to be afraid of? Aren't we in love?" Zhan Mei said;</p>
<p>"I love you, but I don't know..." Pan Qi looked at Zhan Mei's face.</p>
<p>"What are you saying? Don't you trust me? Let's rent a house and live together. I still have some money in the bank, a total of eight hundred seventy-nine yuan, fifty-two cents, which is almost close to a thousand. And Mark owes me ninety-three yuan, I'll go get it back. Let's find a small house to live in."</p>
<p>"But," Pan Qi felt embarrassed, "we haven't gotten married yet."</p>
<p>"Oh, we need to get married first."</p>
<p>They both laughed. They hugged each other and walked forward on Broadway. Although the weather was extremely cold and it was raining, they were infinitely happy in their hearts. (To be continued)</p>
<p>The Hujia in the Mingyue Dance Troupe is indeed a talented person with unlimited prospects in the future. She has the qualifications of "bright eyes and white teeth," and is able to smile at the right time, which is very unobtrusive.</p>
<h3>"Chen Yan Yan" Reciting Aloud at the Boudoir Window</h3>
<p>— Xia Shuxun</p>
<p>Ee-ooh! Ee-ooh! Studying English</p>
<p>Who doesn't know Chen Yan Yan, the actress with a black mole on the left corner of her red lips? She is an actress of Lianhua Company and also a quiet movie star. Last year, she starred in "Spring in the South," "Struggle," and "Three Modern Women." It is now heard that "The Light of Motherhood" (originally named "Childhood in China"), directed by Bu Wancang, will also star her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she is a woman who does not know English. Often when her colleagues say a few English words, she is always confused. But recently she felt even more acutely the pain of not knowing English, so she specially hired a female teacher and spent all day and all night with Huang Shaofen and Li Ying, reciting beside the glass window, ee-ooh! ee-ooh! Just like swallows murmuring on the beam.</p>
<h3>Yan Yuexian's Progress</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Speaking of Yan Yuexian, she has not given us amazing results for five or six years. After she joined Mingxing, she only played supporting roles and never took the lead.</p>
<p>These days, her status has suddenly risen. It is in Mingxing Company's new talking film "Lovesickness," where she plays four women with completely different personalities. Indeed, this time she really developed her talent. Not only is her performance excellent, but her fluent dialogue is enough to overwhelm her peers. It is said that her contract is about to expire, and Mingxing Company has requested a renewal. Her salary has been increased from the original 80 yuan per month to 150 yuan.</p>
