<h3 id="c22">遠東和平會議。 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 實</p>
<p>丨丨荒木「遠東政策」之烟幕丨丨</p>
<p>日本陸軍大臣荒木氏於十月末日忽表示其轉換武力侵略政策。主張召集「遠東和平會議。」其會議内容。據荒木氏自已表示。亦集中於對英美關係與東北對蘇聯關係。并擬邀請東方各國及英美法意德荷各國共同參加。荒木氏之眞意何如。勿待吾人深論。而世界各國之對此。除德國一部分人士略寄同感外。餘皆淡然置之不論不議之列。蓋亦深悉其爲日本軍國主義者之一　烟幕作用而已。即日本現在之外交當局。亦以日軍閥旣一意孤行。摒棄九國公約及非戰公約等於不顧。内田康哉氏復高倡「焦士外交。」退出國聯。致世界和平遠東外交。重陷於極大之殭局。何以忽倡此和平之主張。故對此次荒木之提議。亦表示懷疑。其他更遑論能。</p>
<p>論遠東問題。當以我中國爲最近。然而兩年以來。已結成如此難解之局面。日本又常以非常時期號召其國内民衆。動員陸軍數及十　。支出豫算軍費超過總支出百分之四十。明年度或且不止此數。依此情勢而言和平。和平其能之乎。矧自歐戰以還。國際會議。大都議而難决。决而難行。即以東三省問題四十二對一之决議爲例。可以知之。則豈在歐洲會議爲難而在遠東會議即易乎。以故吾人推測日本之倡導遠東和平會議。簡言之不過爲亞細亞門羅主義之變相。欲借此以誘我中國。欺彼列强。打開日本外交上之孤立。以坐收實利耳。</p>
<p>夫國與國間之關係。所謂外交所謂和平云者。實在尋常時期之關係若臨時而謀共存互利。僅能爲暫時敷衍。最多亦僅能免去一時之流血鬥爭。轉而爲經濟的競賽。如美國與加拿大國境上毫無軍事設備。而美加兩國亦無軍備競爭。經濟關係。圓滑推行無阻。蓋即平常能眞心和平之證也。其他各國。則罕有其比。現在國際關係。在經濟週轉上已欠圓滑。且引起重大之危機。將發爲禾來之戰禍。是其國與國間。平常名爲互相友善。實則猜忌業生。彼此防備。甚至交際塲中。亦含偵察意味。軍事預備。逐漸競起。由唇槍舌劍而至於大砲。由大砲而至飛機毒瓦斯名爲武裝和平。實質乃和平爲武裝之粉飾。設使武力不平等。丨則更振振有詞曰。國民經濟力及一般實力不平等。和平徒爲虚語。於是擴張軍備有詞矣。然而一國國民之力。究竟有限。天然産物。更多缺陷。故僅恃武力者。究難得最後之勝利。而終必遭受應得之酬報也。</p>
<p>日本旣難於拉攏列强。又不能軟化我國。自知武力之不足以支配一切也。於是廣田長外交。乃放棄「焦士政策」而爲「道理外交。」但實質之行動。則仍與前無異。荒木氏其亦自知外交上之孤立。足以影響於日本之政治前途乎。德意志在戰前之榜樣不足法乎。目前之戰爭危機。須待彌縫乎。太平洋沿岸竟乏日本之友乎知之而欲施展其手腕。力謀减少敵方之集結力。打破美蘇復交而操　其間。以圖挽回其厄運。乃由軍部出面。倡爲遠東和平會議之說。一以表示日本亞細亞門羅主義之確立。一以提高日本之國際地　。圖超越華府會議。而執遠東之牛耳。定太平洋之霸權。然而與有關係之各國。並非愚　。詎肯輕易受其播弄。則日本所放之烟幕。亦行見其徒勞而已。</p>

<h3 id="c200">「新師說異議」之異議 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 于夏</p>
<p>施蟄存先生提出關於拙作「新師說」一文的異議，大有息邪說，正人心之槪。予豈好辯哉？予不得得已也！我也對於他的異議要提出異議的。</p>
<p>第一，我說「師固未盡可尊」，以明師有可尊者在也。又說「師亦未必可貴」，不妨師有可貴者在也。何况這理由還是根據孔孟之說呢。這是提倡讀論語的施先生所當引爲欣慰的，說不定還要莞爾而笑曰，德不孤，必有鄰也！至於施先生說拙文「第一段說明師本來並無可尊的性質」，想是施先生讀文選　昏了頭罷。其實，我的本意只是說師有可尊的，也有不可尊的，所以有「師固未盡可尊」之言也。</p>
<p>第二，施先生說，「我們可以因思想學說之不同而謝大學敎授，但絶不能因自已學問增長而不承認中小學的業師」。這是施先生文章的要點所在，拙文似乎没有觸及這層，本來可以不必答復。就令論及猛克關於師弟之爭，如施先生說的「爲魏先生張目」，然而魏先生所住的學校，招牌上明明有一個「專」字，校中的敎員應該是「大師」「敎授」之流，他所以要批評某社畫展，或許正如施先生所說「我們可以因思想學說之不同而謝大學敎授」的緣故罷。（果眞如此，魏先生正該多謝施先生替他下一個謝其本師的解釋。）也許還是魏先生讀過論語，「道德修養之根基」不錯，遵奉「當仁不讓於師」的聖訓，也未可知。</p>
<p>第三，施先生被尊爲「遺少」「洋塲惡少」，謙讓未遑，不免作出洋洋灑灑之大文來抗辯。人之欲善，誰不如我？我也同情。如今施先生又要恭上魏猛克先生以「輕薄」的尊號了，縱使魏先生不肯出來抗辯，然而已所不欲，勿施諸人，孔子的一以貫之的人生哲學是講忠恕之道的，施先生想必讀過論語，作爲「道德修養之根基一，不知作何感想？否則我很懷疑就是有人讀了論語，而且鄭重其事地勸人讀論語，他的「道德修養」還是成問題的。</p>
<p>老實說，我的「新師說」，主要的意思完全是根據孔孟韓愈的老道理，此中没有「新智識」，也没有「新思想」。故意題作「新」，只是開頑笑，其實只算述而不作而已。因此，也不會引出如今什麽了不起的「社會中一個嚴重的問題」，除非說這話的人别有用心。</p>

<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>夏天，這裏是火坑。</p>
<p>風箱呼呼地嚮，小麻臉的手牽軟了的時候，火爐裏的火又紅又熱；鐵條，鐵塊放在火裏，燒了一些時候便紅了。</p>
<p>於是：達達達丨鐵錘打下去。</p>
<p>火花是灼熱的。</p>
<p>「亞標你當心丨」</p>
<p>老閶對舉起鐵錘的亞標說。這臉和身上全很骯髒的亞標是來了不久的夥計。咬緊牙，一邊喘着氣：這工作眞夠苦啊。</p>
<p>現在秋已經深了。可是亞標和小麻臉都流着汗。</p>
<p>鍾老二在用鑽子；沙沙地轉着，銀般的鐵屑落在地上。</p>
<p>全是混濁的烟。鋪子裏好悶呀！</p>
<p>板壁是黑的，地板也是黑的，他們睡覺的床板也是黑色的。但是天暗時已經倦到了不得啦。管他什麽的倒下去便打起鼾聲來。</p>
<p>這一天，外面下着雨。天氣冷得很，一早小麻臉就呼呼地牽起風箱：火着了就立即暖了。老閶還没起身：亞標揪着惺忪的眼睛走出來。瞧瞧擺在那兒要做的東西眞多，下意識地呼了一口氣。</p>
<p>「怎麽呀，亞標？」</p>
<p>小麻臉提起嗓子道。</p>
<p>亞標站在爐火邊：</p>
<p>「媽的我眞受不了！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」</p>
<p>「你瞧這裏：今天得做完牠！老閶不帮忙，小麻臉，我只有這雙手，是不是？」</p>
<p>他伸出手來。</p>
<p>然後，脫了一件夾衣，下面那一件是破了的，小麻臉瞧見他的肐　隆起一塊肉。</p>
<p>鐵塊，鐵條放在火裏。</p>
<p>燒紅了的時候：舉起鐵錘！達達達…火星飛到小麻臉的身上。</p>
<p>「亞標你好大力啊！」</p>
<p>搖搖那剃了没多久的腦袋。</p>
<p>没回答</p>
<p>雨是下午更大了。馬路的低窪處湧着水，冷清清的没有行人。</p>
<p>亞標想：鍾老二怎麽還不來呀？我們苦得要命，他却跟老婆睡覺……</p>
<p>錘好了，浸到水裏去；嗤地一聲兒，水面發了一陣蒸氣亞標停下手，鬆鬆氣之後，用衫袖拭乾了額角的汗水。</p>
<p>鍾老二冒雨來了。</p>
<p>「老二，睡得好舒服呀！」</p>
<p>酸溜溜地說。</p>
<p>鍾老二拍拍他的肩膀，笑迷迷地：　　「我今天帮忙你，亞標你莫……」</p>
<p>「媽的！」</p>
<p>一齊笑起來了。</p>

<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>施蟄存先生忽發奇想，想到「莊子與文選」是「文學修養之根基」，似乎自已用不着，只好「推薦」給别人，想了一想，究竟「推薦」給誰好呢？呵，有了，「表年」！「推薦」給青年的大學生嗎？怕遇着吴世昌先生。「推薦」給青年的大學敎授嗎？怕遇着俞平伯先生。「魯班先師面前誇斧頭」，多見其不知燈籠火把也！施先生又想了一想，他說：</p>
<p>我所謂青年，係指可以讀莊子與文選之青年，並不專指中學生也。若曰中學生，則初中學生不足語此，高中學生應當有幾個可以算在内了。</p>
<p>依施先生的話，青年的中學生也没有幾位必須要讀莊子與文選了。究竟施先生所指「可以讀莊子與文選之青年」是那一等青年呢？「遺少」呢？「洋塲惡少」呢？我很慚愧没有法子從施先生「突圍」那　文章取到一點關於「莊子與文選」的「新智織」，因此我也「懷疑」到施先生突圍的結果了！</p>

<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>丨旅途隨筆之一丨</p>
<p>德步沙還不錯，我們來回都走過了這地方。地上全是沙粒，望過去是一片黄色，兩端接連着山坡。路中間留了連串的脚印。這印跡是很深的。同時有人在路中間放了許多個竹篩子，一個接着一個，相隔只有幾步遠近。我起初還以爲這是預備來給行人　脚的，免得人在沙上移動脚步感到吃力。但後來逼近了看時才知道這也是和尙化緣用的東西，果然有人抛擲了些銅元在那裏面。沙上的確不好走，脚一放下去就像陷進了沙裏，再提起脚時，鞋裏已經積了不少的沙粒，太陽很熱，把沙粒蒸得快發火熖了，脚不能夠在那上面停留一分鐘，否則脚掌心就會給蒸熟了。在這里我只得脫了麻線鞋赤脚走路，做了開跑步的姿勢，雖然吃力但也終於走了。一個年紀稍大的朋友却自認爲吃了敗仗一雇了轎子。</p>
<p>這一次我們没有去遊佛頂山，回去時路過仙人井，從那井裏掐了一瓢凉水喝了，井位置在一個紙的　　，永　清凉，我們每人都喝了幾口；前一天在梅福丹井我們每人也都喝了一杯井水。出了仙人井，我們遇見兩三個道客。他們閒談着從下　走上來，一個　：一普陀山　景緻，要算佛頂山最好。一但是我們單知道已經太遲了。我們就只没去過這地方。</p>
<p>再過一天，早晨大家就預備走了。寺裏的知客說上午有船開往上海，六點鐘以前就把我們送下山，海面上没有一隻輪船。我們在碼頭上等了一個鐘頭還没有動靜。　　旁邊有一座小廟，我們就進去在那裏面歇脚。這廟很小，常常有轎夫來攪擾。一個看廟的和尙在殿裏洗刷錫器，他就向我們絮絮地抱怨他單調的生活。我們正在談話間，外面又有轎夫在打門了，等一會鬧得萬害時，那和尙就提了一根木棒出去</p>
<p>我們在這小廟裡等到十二點鐘，寺裡的人送飯來了。我們想不到還有這頓飯吃。吃完飯不久，外面就有人進來說船到了。我們歡喜地出去看，纔知道這是從上海開來的船。朋友Ｔ，要到海門去，他就和他的母親兄弟走了。我們問别人有没有去上海的船，說明天上午七八點鐘有一隻。我和另一個朋友不能夠回上海。又只得在普陀多留一天。我們疲倦地走回到那個寺院時，連先前送走我們的知客師也有些驚訝了。他也許會高興，因爲寺裡又白白多了五塊錢的進帳。</p>
<h3 id="c205">兩兄弟（十七） <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>他站起身，再向堤岸的盡頭走去。他覺得舒服了一點，他因爲懂得了自已煩燥的原因，窺見了自已的隱衷，發現了另一自我而滿意着。</p>
<p>「然則我是嫉妬哲安啦」他心裏想。「這的確頗爲卑劣，這事！我現在確信我這猜測是對的，因爲我聽着他獲得遺産的消息時，最初想到的便是他會和陸醉米太太結婚。可是我又並不歡喜這有理性的傻女人，這使人生厭的賢淑的少婦。那麽這是一種没有條件的嫉妬，這簡直是嫉妬的本質，這卽是爲嫉妬而嫉妬的嫉妬啦！這事得注意才行！」</p>
<p>他走到了那指示船埠裏面水的高度的信號柱前，他擦燃一支火柴，照着那上面開着的已經到達港外，等着下次漲潮進口的那些船名。快要進口的船裏面有巴西，巴拉他，智利，日本各國的汽船，兩搜丹麥的雙桅帆船，一隻拉威的雙桅快船和一隻土耳其汽船，他看見一土耳其汽船」·幾個字時，好像看見一瑞上汽船」似的大吃一驚：他便在一種奇怪的夢想裏見到一隻大船，載着許多人纏了頭巾，穿着大脚管的袴子爬在那些繩索上面。</p>
<p>「我想得多蠢，」他想；土耳其民族本來是一個善於航海的民族啊。」</p>
<p>他又向前走了幾步，然後站住凝視着海灣。靠右首，在聖安特勒絲海灣上面，赫佛角的　座電力燈塔，好像兩個畸形的，雙生的Cyclopes（神話裏面的額上單生一眼的巨人）樣，向海面投射着牠們的長而且强的眼光。從兩個相鄰的焦點發出來的這兩條平行線，正像兩座彗星的巨大的尾巴似的，沿着一個正直的無際限的斜面，從海岸頂上落到水平線的奥底。其次在兩條堤岸上，另外有兩道燈光，像上面那兩個巨人的孩子似的，指示着哈佛爾港的入口：還有那邊，在賽萊河的另一面，我們還看到另一些燈光，另外許多的燈光，或動或靜，或明或暗，像許多眼睛一樣，時而張着，時而閉着，那些黄的，紅的，綠的，各處港口的眼睛，睨着那黝黑的蓋滿船隻的海面，那些好客的大陸的靈活的眼睛，單是憑着牠們眼瞼的不變而有規則的機械的動作，我們彷佛看出牠們在說；「這是我。我是特洛威而，我是恩佛萊，我是彭多德美河。」還有那咼出其他一切燈塔的，從這樣遠的地方望去使人看作一顆行星的愛妥威而航空燈塔。在越過大河河口的沙帶指示着洛安（Rouen）的路。</p>
<p>隨後在那湛深的水面，在那比天還黑的，没有邊際的水面，我們好像看見這裏那裏都有一些星星。牠們在夜霧裏顫慄着，現得小小的，有些隔得很近，有些隔得很遠，也現得白白的，紅的，綠的各種顏色。這所有的星星差不多全不移動，但偶爾也有幾個好像在奔跑着；這是那些抛了錨在等着漲潮進口的或由遠處開來寄椗的船的燈火。</p>
<p>恰在這時候，月亮從城市後面昇起；她恍若一個巨大的神聖的燈塔，燃在天空來領導那無窮盡的眞的星星一樣。</p>
<p>筆爾喃喃地，幾乎提高着喉嚨說道：「多麽偉大啊，而我們却爲着幾個小錢來淘氣！」</p>
<p>突然，在離他很近的地方，在兩條堤岸之間的那大而黑的塹壕裏面，溜過了一個黑影，個不可思議的巨大的黑影。他伏在花崗石的欄杆上向下望去，他看見一隻漁船開回堤　裏面來了，這漁船走過時，没有一點人聲，没有一點水聲，没有一點槳聲，祇是被那滿孕着海風的棕色大帆輕輕推着前進。</p>
<p>他心想：「如果我們能夠生活在這漁船上，那我們該會多麽安寗喲！」隨後當他再向前走了幾步時，他看見一個人坐在堤岸的盡頭。</p>

<p>— 實賢</p>
<p>「高舉右手，宣誓就職」，以及二再固辭，通電下野」，這二樁事情，除了不看報，或是看報而只看一今天大光明映萬能的女性」，或是「梅蘭芳不日登台」的朋友之外，大抵都覺得這是「宦海升沈」的家常便飯，也不過是如此這般而已。</p>
<p>但是我們若閉了眼睛想一想，那麽，就在這家常便飯的「宦海升沈」之中，却也有很多不可思議的况味。</p>
<p>每一辭呈裡面，總有「積勞成疾」，「心力交瘁」等引人吊下淚來的句子。卽以「一再固辭」而論，也已十足表現着「不許慣紗帽」的苦處。可知做官並不如我們没有做過官的小百姓，老百姓所理想的那麽夠味兒。而摜紗帽者固辭而至於一而再，再而三，給人拉住了膀子不許摜，據說，是因爲没有相當的繼任人才，大有「此公去矣，如蒼生乎」之槪。所以懂了「忍勞忍怨」的官，雖苦，也是不容易辭職的。</p>
<p>但若「忍勞忍怨的官，實在的「積勞的成疾」，「心力交瘁」而一辭再辭地辭掉了，那麽，誰肯來繼一任，又是一個絶大的問題。雖然一方面才一准予辭職」，一方面已「任」某某某了，但當某某高舉右手，宣誓就職之後，立刻就得有一個「固辭不獲，勉任艱鉅」的通電，以表示一百二十萬分的委曲，並不是自已愛把紗帽套上腦袋。</p>
<p>所以我們對於「新官上任，舊官請出」的那一升一沉之間，實在不能看作怎麽平凡的一件事，而該體會到這是又一批跳火坑的。</p>
<p>從上述的種種，我們可以見到「官」的乏味，所以不是傻子，便不該做官。就是「三顧茅廬，固辭不獲」，至多也只可「勉任艱鉅，以待賢能」，一有機會，便該一潔身引退，以讓賢能。吉鴻昌，方振武，一敗塗地了，還要求「名義」，「軍長」，眞傻。還有些無名候補官，老是摔着八行書，奔走權貴，没命的想在宦海裡浮沉，更是傻得透了頂。</p>

<p>在數年以前，翻版不成問題，儘你印着「版權所有，翻印必究」，熟視若無觀。近來上海的出版界，不肯放棄了，漸漸在那裏注意，一有發見，就得交涉，和解不成，便請法律救濟。倘然翻版在窵遠地方，只得睜大了眼，搓着手没有辦法。</p>
<p>現在有些聰明人，不翻中國書的版，却翻外國書的版。或者說中國出版界，没有加入萬國版權同盟，在法律上可以脫卸責任，只在道　土有些說不過去。其實這是冠冕話，妙在原本的出版者遠在數萬里以外，所謂鞭長莫及。</p>
<p>不過爲了金價的奇昻，學生們購買力的單薄，不能不許他們揀着便利的去購買。因此有兩樁有趣的事發生，在我們蘇州</p>
<p>一樁是甲校的外國校長，絶對不許學生購買翻版的外國書，以保持他的外國道德。而乙校的中國校長，對外國先生說：「我們中國，比書更重大的權利，給外國人侵略去的多着呢。一因此乙校就任便着學生。</p>
<p>一樁是丙校的倫理學敎授是外國人，問學生「你們願意買翻版書麽？」學生因爲這問題和倫理學本身有關，所以很難置答，只好不響，那外國敎授又問：「原版和翻版的價錢，相差多少？」一位學生答「原版須十四元以上，翻版不消四元餘。」那外國敎授微笑以後，就默然了。</p>
<p>最近美國一化學家，在他的化學敎本的重版序言上說：「我很快活，看見了一本中國翻版的書。」這信化學家頗有幽默的風趣。</p>

<p>咱們中國人，數千年來有一個傳統和觀念，就是「重男輕女」。據說：「女兒是賠錢貨」，生了女兒，千辛萬苦，撫養大了，奉送給人家，都覺得不容易丨你瞧，那些爲他女兒擇婿的，窮户頭，固然不要，富人家，又嫌官人不漂亮，就是咱老子瞧上了眼，不知道咱的女兒以爲怎樣，這也不對，那又不配，夠多麽煩惱丨雖說是現在都講究一個自由，但是，這一筆自由澤婿之費，也夠你負擔。第一是要把伊們送進學堂裏去讀書，第二是要把伊們打扮得似花似玉，纔有人來追求，便可以自由而戀愛。等到戀愛而成功，那陪嫁的妝奩，不怕你做老子的少一點。不然，便要給人家瞧不起，難爲了你的女兒，不好做人哪丨至於說到女婿有半子之靠，這是笑話奇談。要知道，女婿阿官，多少帶點客氣，任是你怎樣靠法；老來送終，非你兒子莫辦，難不成呌女婿來捧頭稱孤嗎？唉！咱們中國人，數千年來「重男輕女」的觀念，也許爲的就是這以上所說的種種原因吧？</p>
<p>雖然，自古來靠女兒，克享榮華富貴的倒也不少。只要你的女兒，長得天仙般的美麗，能彀博得人們稱一聲「安琪兒」，那就是你的造化不錯，希望無窮。起碼說起來，就是伊獨個兒出去，用不着你擔心，自有許多義務保鏢者，追隨伊左右，遇到了野狗，决小會嚙傷了伊的大腿。至於談到擇婿問題，自然囉，更用不着你費一點心，擔一些愁。不要說洋行買辦，銀行大班，要來攀親。就是要人闊老，也要央媒來說合理。那時節，丈姆娘看女婿，越看越有趣，還有「重男輕女」的念頭嗎？</p>
<p>唉！本來在這個世界上，說「重男輕女」的，眞是天字第一號的傻瓜　要知道，「不重生男重生女」，纔有希望哪。</p>

<p>— 起予</p>
<p>東北淪陷後，國内稍有血氣的，都萬分憤慨，我想除掉不抵抗將軍之外，總人同此心吧。但日了隔得久了，抗日的呼聲，漸漸的微了，翻開報紙，抗日的字樣，也漸漸的少了，一般抗日同志的姓名和踪跡，也不容易見到了。不多幾時，有一位抗日少將江民聲，淪落滬市，至爲人擦皮鞋，最近又有一位抗日同志梁桐芳的拉人力車。抗日的結果如此，不抗日的天天花天酒地，過其享樂生涯，想形之下，眞令人哭笑不得。自梁桐芳君之消息傳佈各報後，在下因和姚兆里律師向屬老友，梁君踪跡，又常出没姚律師之門，所以特於昨天下午，用電話請姚君轉約梁君晤談，在五點鐘左右，在下與梁君，便在姚律師事務所中會見了。、梁君面色清　，中等身材，穿的是土布中山裝，人極和氣，他本是浙江人虞人，做過錢莊生意，一一八事起，卽投身上海市民義勇軍，後在翁照垣將軍部下當隨營學生，期滿，加人上、學生軍東北志願團，開往前線作戰，當時滿想直搗黄龍，那知結果如此。來滬後，因爲一時不容易找到相當職業，遂决定去拉人力車，自食其力，不願受親友接濟分文。他來滬本已好幾天，因爲租人力車本人是外行，不知如何手續，跑了五六天，還是没有結果。好在姚律師的堂妹瑞芳女士，南來時曾有介紹信給他來見姚君，當時姚君的意思，原想予以經濟上的援助，梁君以拉人力車未始不是職業，所以堅决謝絶，最後只得姚君替他想法租到了一輛黄包車，每天租價是六角五分大洋。</p>
<p>在下和梁君見面時，他拉車祇有第四天，據說有一次拉到一個客人，說明要到法租界某處，後來忽然又呌他拉到新北門外一家飯店門口。那人跳下車後，向他仔細打量一番，忽問梁君是不是報上所載明抗日同志梁某，梁君起初不答，經他堅問下去，只得回說是的。那人便很高興的一定要請他進去一同吃飯，梁君不肯，終於被他接了進去。據說這人姓屠，是在龍華路開設一家藥棉廠的，他看了報後，極表同情於梁君。還有一家飛星車行，爲了尋找梁君，竟派了幾輛脚踏車四出尋覓他這部人力車的照會，後來總算找到，請去談話了半天，其餘各報各通訊社記者，到姚君事務所去訪問他的絡繹不絶。</p>
<p>在下問梁君，他的蹤跡，怎樣會被新聞記者知道，梁君道：我到滬本已多天，我要拉黄包車，是想以之爲暫時職業，一有抗日機會，還是要出去的，並不想借此出風頭，不過那天我在姚律師處，恰巧復興通訊社記者，也在這裏，遂由姚君之介紹，和這位記者談話，次日各報，便多登載出來。</p>
<p>最後，梁君說：我能回到上海，總算是萬幸，像還有七位同去的同志，至今猶在冰天雪地中，因爲經濟無援，困苦不堪，欲歸不得。現在抗日已成過去，深望滬上各界，能設法救他們出來，那七位同志的姓名。是張慕仁，朱學明，黄爕梗，俞更生，倪懷新，金鐘，鄒天錫，梁君說完，不禁附髀興嘆，恰巧又有新聞記者來訪，在下便興辭而出。</p>
<p>這時，早已萬家燈火，跳無塲裏的樂聲響了，香檳……内……樂呀，……沉醉的心靈，是永遠不會知亡國的痛苦的！</p>

<h3 id="c264">美色與選妻 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>讀本刊賓符先生的「金錢與擇夫」，因偶有所感，也引起我寫這一篇（美色與選妻一，和牠作一對照。</p>
<p>關於男女婚姻的選擇，從來許多人都譏諷女子每以「金錢」爲選擇丈夫的主要條件，這誠然是事實，是女子心理上的一種錯誤，殊不知男子的選擇妻子，也蹈上一種偏見，就是常以「美色」爲「理想妻子」的標凖。</p>
<p>揣女子看重「金錢」的原因，無疑的，這是因爲女子大都有一種「虚榮心」，爲要滿足這種虚榮心，自不能不藉助於金錢的力量，以達其目的；故她們「理想中的丈夫一必須是個經濟充裕的男子。至於男子的選擇女子，都在「美色」上着想，這又是什麽用意？武斷地說，這無非是要滿足他們的「性慾」。（廣義的解釋）因爲一位秀麗妻子，她給與丈夫性慾上的安慰，自然比一位醜惡夫人來得美滿。故一班求偶的男子，他們的心目中，都在希望能夠得到一個安琪兒般的伴侣。</p>
<p>在這裏，問題就發生了。我們不是說女子偏重「金錢」是錯誤的嗎？這種錯誤不是曾給無數人痛駡過的嗎？而男子偏重「美色」的觀念又是怎樣呢？難這就是正當的心理不成？不然，怎麽對於這一點，至今很少有人注意及，下攻擊的更未嘗聽到？這是什麽緣故呢？無他，因爲現在的世界，仍然是個男子中心的世界丨所以男子處處佔便宜，女子事事吃虧。</p>
<p>說到異性的選擇，自然是因人而不同，本來就没有一定的標凖有的注重這樣，有的注重那樣。你要指摘出誰是合理的，誰是不合理的，自然是不可能。不過我們要明白，一位男子和一位女子的結合，要想在共甘共苦中生活下去，則兩方的性格，學問，思想，習慣，行爲，健康等，都很重要，都應顧全；金錢和美色，僅能算是許多條件中之一，不能做爲主要的選擇鵠的。故女子的偏重「金錢」，是錯的；男子的偏重「美色」，也是不對的。我們豈能專責女子，而寬恕男子呢？</p>
<p>以上是指正當的男女配偶而言，至若一些「物質狂」的女子，和「色迷」的男子，那麽另作别論。因爲她們和他們只知滿足「物慾」和「色慾」，餘的可以一槪不問。在這種場合，女子惟「金錢」是重，男子惟「美色」是視：女子有了「金錢」，則什麽皆可以犧牲；男子有了「美色」，則一切盡可以放棄，這是大不合理的　社會上　不　有多少男女因需而陷入毁滅之道哩丨這是一件很痛心的事。故我以爲「虚榮心」誠是女子的弱點，「美色觀念」也正是男子的缺德！</p>

<p>衆生顚倒旗袍下，交際塲中拿摩温，</p>
<p>夜間跳舞碰麻雀，日間睡到三點零，</p>
<p>洋樓大厦眞舒服，摩托卡車代步行，</p>
<p>丫環使女憑呼喚，大姐娘姨一大羣，</p>
<p>少爺萬事全依吾，伏伏貼貼最温存，</p>
<p>吾將臨到抽身起，他還替吾整衣襟，</p>
<p>高跟皮履替吾穿，洗臉還替吾撲粉，</p>
<p>吃粥吃飯吃點心，嘉餚送到吾嘴跟，</p>
<p>如若出外去遊玩，並肩挽臂一同行，</p>
<p>人說吾倆有艶福，大衆見了要銷魂，</p>
<p>招搖過市風頭健，喁喁情話最出神，</p>
<p>日前瞎子來算命，說吾要交正財運，</p>
<p>航空獎劵將開彩，五十萬金有吾分，</p>
<p>黄災黑災都不管，燒香拜佛是正經，</p>
<p>什麽愛國不愛國，舶來衣料穿上身，</p>
<p>洋氣十足都洋化，國難臨頭不聞問，</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>最近二房東府上遽然有了異樣。　　最顯著的是那麽富麗的客堂間的擺飾，都縮上三樓二小姐的臥室裏去了，同時頭門上貼了一張客堂召租的字條。因此成日價嚮鬧的麻將，連二小姐臥室裏常闢的那一桌都一齊闐然了。</p>
<p>其次是某一天的黄氏時候，在二小姐臥室裏，太太在座，小姐的夫壻也在座，開初是咭裏咕嚕一頓兒，接着是三人皆沉默，一會兒小姐哭泣了，夫壻便兩手撑着腮巴，低頭喪氣，太太呢，木鷄也似的站在旁邊發呆。</p>
<p>再次，太太每天總是慌裏慌張，像梭織似的在「之」字形扶梯上從客堂爬上三樓，從三樓又爬下灶披間。而且當爬過我的房口時，完全不像前昔那麽一幅鐵青面孔了，滿臉堆着苦的笑容，無緣没故的向我打招呼，有時我的搭措在坐靠椅上的襪子給背脊連下了地，她看見了，便馬上進房給我拾將起來說：「匡先生，你眞用工夫，襪子丢落在地下啦丨」</p>
<p>此外如子向是那麽驕傲不睬人的二小姐，也格外謙和些了，在扶梯上駁身過，她總是那麽一個迷眼，簡直使我疑想她是中了瘋魔，弄得我的心兒怪蕩的，有時甚至想向她「打主意」。</p>
<p>此外太太原來還有那麽一個滾壯的大小姐帶着一夥兒的髒孩子住在晒臺披間裏；據太太說，大小姐的命的夠苦了，婆家簡直没有飯吃，所以，也是不得已纔來這兒挨食。早幾天，一架鬧着，就給二小姐趕走了。</p>
<p>這情形有了一星期之久了，於我好像是一個謎，怎樣也猜度不穿，也不便啓齒盤問。加之我是外帮客，一向就是孤零零的，前樓後樓，左鄰右舍，往常都没有來往，驟然間也不便與他們去討論這突如其來的二房東的異樣。</p>
<p>謎，終歸是一個謎。</p>
<p>不過我自已有把握的是，這謎大槪與我無涉吧！</p>
<p>是深夜了，我正在翻讀魯迅的呐喊上孔乙已一篇，讀到孔乙已瞪着已不多了的茴香豆，搖着頭對孩子們掉文：「不多不多，多乎哉？不多也。」的時候，正笑得眼縫裏流水，門外起了一陣緊的叩門聲，接着是太太進來，二小姐也一扭，閃現在我的桌前了。格外的和氣，使我感到恐懼與侷促。</p>
<p>「匡先生，很對不住，想同你商量一樁事……」太太說着又停止了。</p>
<p>「好的，什麽事？」我滿口承認她，二小姐在旁邊嫣然一笑，（顯然是苦笑）太太纔又咽哽似的繼續說下去：</p>
<p>「匡先生，你知道，我們的老閭本在輪船上做事，進賬不少，但他老了還發瘟，抛錢儘管　進漢口的一家姘頭的袋裏去，全不顧親家。二妹的夫婿近來也困難了，以致拖欠了大房東九個月的房租，五百多兩。眞没法想。我們只好暫時避開一下，想把幾件値錢一點的家私寄在匡先生房裏，免得被封没，過幾日我們再設法來拿去丨」</p>
<p>我連連的說「本來可以，不過，」門外的娘姨，就把箱櫉滾進來了，二小姐還說要搬來她那張八十隻老洋的花銅床，我急得堵住房門，這纔告了。</p>
<p>就是這麽樣，我的小樓做了她們的保險庫，看着她們那麽可憐，當時也實在不好處置，或竟把牠原復推出房去，只想明日再同她們細話，另外想辦法。房東太太已慌得說不出話來，只是斷續的：「拜…托…拜…托！大房東來查了，說是你的。」</p>
<p>等到我第二天起床，眞不料她們一早就逃光了，也許是昨晚就逃了。</p>
<p>於是乎坊裏一逕騷亂到現在。</p>
<h3 id="c267">瑛 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>瑛病了，病得不像一個人！今天，聽醫生說，她患的是乾血癆。哎呀，癆病是「金錢病」没有錢的瑛也配患這個病症嗎！她是要臥着等死了！</p>
<p>瑛，我瞧着臥在躺椅上黄瘦得像枯柴一樣的瑛，她年紀還不滿三十歲，可是她的青春，是早已凋殘得凈盡了！不，在短捉的生活史上，她是没有所謂什麽青春，她有的只是痛心悽凉的回憶。</p>
<p>十八歲那年，由父母之命，媒妁之言，嫁給了梅君，在婚後的一二年，尙還能平安無事地生活着，可是極近的五年間，光景是大大的變更了，梅君以一個無一技之長而只靠着油頭滑腦混飯吃的人，當然應該受潮流浪花的繫盪而至失業了。然而在家中終日作牛馬操勞的她，還没受翁婆的虐待，姑嫂的白眼，最後是無條件的給他們驅逐出了家庭，理由是瑛的命運太壞，害得丈夫殘廢在家裏没有生意做。雖然梅君是他們唯一的愛子，瑛是他們所寵愛的媳婦，但在濃刷着宗法觀念的老人家，死守着「養兒防老」的遺訓，對於不能拿錢去孝敬他們的兒子和媳婦，以沸點的愛心降而至於冰點，那是没有什麽詫異的。</p>
<p>五年以前，梅君還在ＸＸ公司當職員，每月的收入，倒也不差。但「飽暖思淫」百餘元的月薪，怎夠他任意的揮霍呢？整週的，整月的不見他返家，害得瑛望眼欲穿，眼巴巴的拖長着頭頸空等，有時整夜不能合眼，清凉之夜，只好擁衾獨眠，暗自悲苦地咽泣着以挨過這漫漫的長夜。等到梅君回家來了，她們仍舊是不理睬她，但她須得去奉承他，因爲在舊式的女子心理上，以爲丈夫是唯一神聖的「靠山」，怎可不去對他殷勤呢？言語上偶一不愼，遭他的拳打脚踢，那是很平常的。</p>
<p>梅君終於因過分的浪漫而不容公司的老板而被辭退了。於是他經濟的絶糧，是無疑的了。在揮霍慣　的他，將怎樣自抑呢？他的眼睛又因以前過分的縱慾而現在發作成盲目了。於是他一切不能彈動，祇有坐着等待死的降臨。可是死神怪寬恕着他而不來捉他。肚子又是無法紥緊的，餓了仍舊要吃。可憐的瑛，一個瘦弱得像枯柴般的女人，一生受夠了無代價的折磨，這時因丈夫的不成器而牽連到自已的命運，而被驅逐了！</p>
<p>她是病了，病得不像一個人！在一間斗大的房間裏，我瞧着她篷亂的髮，瘦黄的臉，深凹的眼珠和枯柴的手，便有一個猙獰的黑影子在這小房子裏閃動着。</p>

<p>— 亞珠</p>
<p>英國大哲學家赫勃德斯賓塞生平只與知已朋友往還，至於陌生人總不肯會面，其理由：</p>
<p>「一個人的精彩丨丨心靈所産的最優等的産物，皆在於著作之中，唯獨糟粕部份留在身旁，以資日常談話。」</p>
<p>因爲精彩理論，簡約言之，則人不明，且常反生誤解，或誤會。詳細言之，（通常朋友往來，不是如學校中上課，可以講學論道。）則人覺討厭，令人不耐煩，不欲卒聽，未曾說明，他人或在中途截擊，或斷章取義，加於辯駁，或竟鄙笑，使你非常憤懣嘔氣。雖密切親友。亦須警戒。所以有精彩理論，必須著述。著述和談話的村料，須完全分開：</p>
<p>精彩的訴諸筆墨。</p>
<p>非精彩的用於談話。</p>
<p>著述則越精彩越好。</p>
<p>談話則越隨便越好。</p>
<p>大抵較有思想的青年人初入世的時候，以爲和人家閒談，極無意思。因不許和人交談，或談，必談重要的事件或理論，以爲較有意義。不料才開口說一二句，便令人誤會，或令人討厭，每致無法辯明，又不由你述明衷曲，欲益反損，氣得要命。因人與人間是有隔膜的，世故越深的人，越多猜疑，并皆主觀甚强，你一談理論，他不先管你的理論對否，便先猜想你談論的背景，或猜你賣弄聰明，或疑你暗裏說他。他便和你過不去了。這又無法說明，因爲他以爲不是說他，爲什麽要對他發議論呢？比自幼稚的，便不能和你談論什麽東西。比自已學問，年齡高的，他又要保持自已的尊嚴，并執着自以爲是，後生小子必無高見的成見，亦無談論的餘地，苟非知已，甚至普通的閒談，還要當心。</p>
<p>起初寫文，目的不是重在發表意見，而重在獲得文名。繼而感到精彩理論，不能和人談說，而且言談傳播範圍甚狹，因須著文發表，此時名譽心已减退，而重在理論獲得同情，不過有名舉，較易使人信仰或重視自已的意見。</p>
<p>終則因自已理論，鍜鍊益精，旣不能和少數接近的人講說，這心靈精彩的産物，不便獨自欣賞，而且可以促進世界的發展，不願任它消失，和少婦受孕，懷胎十月，不能不産一樣，因不得已從事著述，刊行於世，這時但有責任心而無名譽心了。</p>

<p>— 心</p>
<p>一　前　赴Ｘ　的宴會，在宴會席上，　地真來一位束裝　於我們學生隊伍的女客，經客人的介紹，我也和她互相談起來，後來不知爲了什麽我們有請求她寫住址的必要，她說「我寫不來的」起初我們以爲她是客氣：後來知道她　確實實　眞話。當時我們都很詫異，以爲束裝這樣摩登的女子，至少應該議幾個眼頭字，那知竟是一個有眼瞎子，太出人意料之外了！她去了；我們一夥學生是嚴致喜打聽事情的，我們便在另一位女客那裏得了這樣的傳說：「她今年廿四歲，前年與丈夫離了婚，因自已没有正式擔負自已生活費的能力，所以就投身舞塲，作變態的經濟獨立，她現在徬徨在舞場與影戲業的歧途上徘徊着。她是一個非正式的舞女和明星。」</p>
<p>啊！什麽地方都有了女子的足跡了，這是何等足以慶幸的一回事，幾多年　鬧着女權運動，一旦有了相當的成功，怎不呌人高歌而低舞了呢。可是呀！可是呀！美中總有不足的，「花瓶」是一個怎樣動聽的名詞而賜予了一般一月的　水僅夠充購脂粉的公司職員的姑娘們，她們的經濟算是獨立了，但聽見很多人說他們是操着仕麽生意的。</p>
<p>舞場是爲着人們娱樂而開設的，并且是給一般婦女，出賣感人的肉和窈窕的恣服的場所，這點誰這能夠否認呢？其他的戲劇，我們在此不談，就來說最近大家所公認爲敎育工具一種的電影吧，旣然它已被衆人們重視到這種地步，那末，負荷着敎育人們的重任了，假使如上述的女客她這樣目不識丁，在這種演員們身上，能夠得到些什麽實際的敎育？她們除了媚人的秋波，鮮紅的嘴唇，高聳的乳峯，肥胖的大腿……以肉感香艶妖奇的外，狀來抓住顚倒她們的觀衆以外，根本談不到什麽藝術的意味。無謂的捧場的，或欲推銷他們的商品的，就利用了她們去做了堂堂皇皇的廣告，啊！她們應該自覺，雖然她們每日可有很多的進欵，可是呀！她們成爲了寄生蟲了，成爲了造成目前迷亂不安寗的因子！至多是一種變態的經濟獨立，因爲我們應該明白自已所負的大任，我們要以我們充分的才力，來換取適量的代價。</p>

<p>籃　乘了九路公共汽車到福煦路去，這樣一條漫漫的長途上，坐着有　無卿，於是拿出一本書來，有意無意地　鬧着。那兒上來了一大羣的乘客，那兒下去了一大羣的乘客，我一聲也没有知道，直等到一位洋人查標者上來向我查票時方才知道是查票的上來了。一幕怪劇，就此　生了：</p>
<p>在這開車的那面一只座位上　　一個中年男子，手裏拿了一只不知什麽　，車上的乘客，各各都買過票了。唯有他還是銅板緊緊地握在手心裏，當查票走過去查他的票時，他問「到ＸＸ路幾分呀！」洋人查票接了銅板，獰獰地笑了一笑，到賣票人這裏換了一張票，然後再遞給他，旋在一本簿子上不聲不響的寫幾下，什麽話都不說了。（因爲他算是買票人要「揩油」（哪）默默地立在車中　聽賣票人與那個拿了瓶兒的人口角了。「害人精，不聲不響坐在角落裏。你媽的，想揩油，害别人受罰，不要臉的東西。」賣票的恨極了，惡狠狠地駡着。</p>
<p>「你　是不要臉的小狗東西，自已戀揩油，不就來賣票，還要駡别人，當些心！」對方也鐵青了臉持着自以爲是的地由毫不示弱地反辯着。</p>
<p>「當心什麽？不聲不響鬼般坐在這裏，爲什麽别人都買了，獨有你一個人不買呢？」</p>
<p>「自已想揩油是實在的！」</p>
<p>「我眞不想揩油，揩油的錢會做刮痧錢的，你這樣下流的不要臉的害人精，依理要你買足三十四分，那個知你是什麽地方滾上來的。……」</p>
<p>「……………………」</p>
<p>洋人查票靜靜地似懂非懂的立在那兒，兩只躱在黄毛叢裏的眼珠子亮晶晶地向他們遛着。坐在我旁邊的一個穿黑長衫歪戴了呢帽的瘦先生開口發表議論了：我們是不得而知的，你們兩個自已心裏總明白的，不過揩是揩外國人的油，你們何必這般的頂眞呢？咱們同是中國人，因着外國人的事情在外人面前鬧笑話，這是多麽掉臉的事情呀！（對賣票：」你有嘴分不清的麽？爲什麽出口便駡人？這是你不應該的！……」</p>

<p>兵甲：那有什麽，你還怕麽？</p>
<p>兵戊：你打一槍，到是做了好事　。</p>
<p>兵乙：我不敢，我的槍不打自已人的。</p>
<p>兵甲：你這没用的傢伙，等我來。</p>
<p>兵已：對凖他的頭袋！</p>
<p>兵甲：送你回老家去罷！</p>
<p>（兵甲開槍，兵庚不再動顚。大家慘然。）</p>
<p>兵辛：要死就要死得痛快些，像這樣一槍不死，還要再來一槍，眞是太痛苦了。</p>
<p>兵乙：你呌什麽寃呢，快打呀！</p>
<p>（忽然敵軍槍聲中止，）只有猛烈的跑聲。）</p>
<p>兵已：咦？怎麽的？敵軍爲什麽不放槍啦？</p>
<p>兵甲：哼，這一來可要當心，他們又要衝鋒過來了。（坦克車聲）</p>
<p>兵戊：聽，坦克車也開過來了。</p>
<p>兵丙：兄弟們，我們拿好手溜彈。</p>
<p>兵乙：可是我們的手溜彈早已没有多少了。</p>
<p>兵甲：没有手溜彈怕什麽？我們有的是大刀和槍剌，我們有的是熱血和頭顱。來，兄弟們，拿起我們大刀，上起剌刀來，等着罷！</p>
<p>（敵軍的大跑彈落到戰塲中來，烟霧迷漫，塵土飛揚。我軍架機關槍，上剌刀嚴整以待。電光閃爍，照射着每一個人臉上緊張之極。其後，遠處微聞衝鋒的號聲。自遠而近的喊殺聲。近處有剪鐵絲網的聲音。）</p>

<h3 id="c272">好萊塢謀事之秘訣（上） <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 廣道</p>
<p>琪恩哈羅經騐之談　第一要點在能忍耐</p>
<p>你常常看見不見經傳的名字，忽然進了好萊塢的電影界，突然地紅了起來，當然你羨慕得很。但是你却不得其門而入；每次寫信給那些明星們，或電影公司，請敎他們怎樣就可以做一個演員，你聽得不到一個回音。這並不是他們對於你的問題，漠不關心，他們有許多人，從前在没有進影界之先，亦是常常問這個問題的：他們或者心裏很想邦你的忙，告訴你一些秘訣；但是，這是多末複雜的一個問題呀；他們就是要告訴你，亦是心有餘而力不足；他們那裏來這許多功夫呢？</p>
<p>當然，好萊塢是塞滿了求事的人，能夠做到臨時演員的，已經算是幸運了；而要做長期演員的，確是　乎其難。但是，你們不要灰心。機會並不是没有，祗要你憤得進影界的門徑，這並不是敎你去鑽門路，去尋有勢力的人帮你的忙，而是在乎你自已去努力的。</p>
<p>問題是很簡單的：「我怎樣就可以進電影界？」但是答案就太複雜了。你要知道怎樣化妝，怎樣讀脚本，怎樣訓練你的聲音，怎樣操練你的身段，怎樣改正你姿勢上不自然不文雅的地方，怎樣用手勢。你又要知道初到好萊塢來；要帶多少錢，等機會的時候，如何能生活，等等一切。當然這些不是一位不相識的影星，能夠盡量告訴你的。</p>
<p>現在好了。有一位大明星肯將好的經騐告訴你們。她亦是從艱難困苦裏爬出來的，當然她的話是很有帮助於一般想進影界而苦無門路的人的。她就是鼎鼎大名的金髮女郎琪恩哈羅。以下就是她發表的一番意見：</p>
<p>「第一個根本條件就是那些要進影界的人，先須有涵養工夫，能與失望奮鬥。好萊塢是一個變化不測，富於幻象的地方。除非你有這剛毅不屈之心，百折不撓的志向，你趁早不必來。因爲在這裏，隨便什麽事，都是游移不定的。今天你得到了一個機會，你以爲是穩到手的了，可是明天又被别人搶了去了」。</p>
<p>「無論什麽女子，凡要到好萊塢來尋事的，總要自已帶錢來化，不要預先計算自已能在好萊塢賺多少錢。她至少應當帶夠一年化的錢。她一定要能供給自已的時髦衣着。這樣，她旣能財政獨立了，她的機會也一定多些。好萊塢的生活程度，並不十分高。房租，吃食並不太費。衣服是一年四季相同的。聰明些能計算的女子，在好萊塢住一年，有一千二百美金，亦就可以對付了；倘使她能犧牲些個人的樂趣，或者還可以减省些」。</p>
<p>「你没有强健的體格，你亦不必進電影界，因爲進了影界，工作的繁重固然可以使你　腰曲背；就是你没有事做的時候，那種無定狀的生活，尤其能使你難於支持。所以現在在影界的女演員，要是她們是一心向上的，她們都不敢任情縱欲，她們的避酒色，如同避瘟疫一樣，因爲人身不是鐵石做的，「一支蠟燭兩頭點」是最能傷人的。還有一樣，下賤的名聲，是最要不得的。你有了下賤的名聲；就喪失了上好的機會。你到好萊塢來，你應當愛惜你的名譽，比你在鄕間還要小心。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c273">「歸去來兮」評 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>“Strangers　Return”</p>
<p>本來在目前的電影批評，已經成了一種公式，首先根據着故事，發一點議論，接着對於技巧，加一點評論，當然顧着行文的方便，這樣，未始不可。但是每一張影片，都用這一個方式批評，實在太無意思。</p>
<p>不過這一張「歸去來兮」，却首先値得注意的就是「故事」。</p>
<p>「故事」是叙述「老翁多爾，多産而病，他的貧而貪的戚族環侍其側。待翁逝世，即攫其肥田。是時，翁之孫女璐伊絲，適自城中歸，翁日與徘徊阡陌。女邂逅少年克萊，數度過從，遂相戀愛。但克萊爲有婦之夫，翁之戚族，竭力攻訐，使女離翁；翁受剌激，神經錯亂，戚族思陰圖之，賴女囑其鎭靜，神志較清，親書遺囑付女而卒。而最後克萊與女告别，離鄕赴城中謀生，蓋彼不欲戀懚累女，雙方各趨光明之前途！」</p>
<p>我們知道一個「主題」，經過了作家的意識而成主題，中間就有作家的剏作方法在活動。所以，作家選擇題材，或則强調題材的某一部份，就是作家的剏作方法的實踐。作家的觀念，是生活决定的。所以舊的作家，不容易看到現實的社會，但優秀的作家，有時候是看到的。「陶白斯敎受」就是極好的例子。現在這一張「師去來兮」，雖則中心思想，還脫不了同情於有肥沃田土的老翁，痛絶「貧而貪」的戚族的「市儈」思想。而不能深刻的暴露財産制度的内在，但是，在最後他已經能夠跳出了美國電影的男女結婚的大團圓，而使男女兩方各自走開，不能不說是一個進步。</p>
<p>「歸去來兮」，是金維多導演的，金維多在中國艱衆中，雖則没有西席地密爾，劉别謙等那樣的熟悉，但也不像柏勃斯德，英格蘭姆的生疎，而他的手腕，也正和柏勃斯德，英格蘭姆一樣，遠在劉别謙等之上。好像這張「歸去來兮」。他能夠把這一個「平凡」（自然主義作家所謂的「平凡」）的故事，用差不多「福倫倍爾」「巴華荔夫人傳」中的文學的描寫手法，叙述出來。因爲故事中没有十分暄耀的情節，像普通美國片那樣，所以導演也始終保持平靜的調子，即似老翁之死等塲面，他也只把色調弄得深沉，而不剌激，我覺得很是可取的。</p>
<p>自然，缺點是有的，好像對於克萊的灑落的個性，没有他細的表現，所以最後的决然行動，覺得突然。</p>
<p>演員方面，里昻巴里摩亞很好，超過他其它的作品，這或則是導演的有力，密麗霍金絲努力得很。</p>
<p>鏡頭也很好，特别是外景的美麗，當然，只是田園詩人所歌咏的美麗！</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c274">我也來評評「春潮」 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 之琴</p>
<p>春潮的開演，已經過了許久時候了；當我看這部片子時，還在開始公演的第二天。本來我當時看後就想做一篇評，但我想道：這個批評賣座，是有一定的幾個批評家特别包廂的，加之這已經是第二天了，搶快也没裕望，假定馬馬虎虎寄去，只不過白送　票而已。但是想不到現在報紙上還有層出不窮的批評，而且也有幾個評者名子是生疏的。於是我不禁也手癢了，便寫出以下這些：</p>
<p>（一）意議：只是叙訴兩個痴男怨女的悲哀的羅曼史，這樣平淡而無聊的故事，在有更大渴求的我們，是如何的不需要知道，就是玉瑛在將死時呻吟着的歌！「甜蜜的夢，回來吧！」也不能博得觀衆的同情之淚。</p>
<p>（二）灌音：犯了不調合的毛病，例如走路，在一個環境中，有時皮鞋囊囊作響，有時却没有聲音，在輪船裡，旣是有聲片子，却没有輪船機械動作的響聲：加之收音模糊，我雖然定神靜聆，終没聆懂他講底什麽；而在其他時候有幾場，却出乎意外的清晰；這個新出的國産聲片，這點是令我鶩喜的。</p>
<p>（三）佈景；大致還好，不過總難免有時欠眞實。</p>
<p>（四）演員；高占非在後半表演得很有力，只是在開始表情欠缺於滯鈍點，王人美的活潑，那是她底本色，而在後半部悲哀的表情不十分美滿，這是導演者没有仔細審視人物的分配關係，李麗飾的蕩婦，初上銀幕就這樣自然，是很難得的。袁叢美還好，紳士神氣十足，其餘配角，也都稱職。</p>
<p>（五）電影；很有幾個鐘頭非常成熟，只是開首幾幕大漠糊了。</p>
<h3 id="c275">關於小玩意的疑問 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 王連熊</p>
<p>昨日偶然拿起報來瞧瞧，看見了恁般大的一幅廣告：原來小玩意又在北京大戲院重映了。我去看了，在師路上，細細的咀嚼着剛才的影片，不禁使我有了下列幾個問題；茲分述於左：</p>
<p>（一）當袁璞和富孀在玩具廠中談話的時候，眞弄得我丈二和尙摸不着頭腦，莫明其土地堂；袁璞幾時回國的？幾時開辦玩具廠？雖然在字幕中，有着「回國後才七個月」的字樣，但是並不有講出他回國時的情形，和開辦玩具廠的前後經過狀况。</p>
<p>（二）袁璞和富孀的認識也不清楚。</p>
<p>（三）阿勇究竟是什麽人？怎樣和珠兒認識？如何　一步變成爲珠兒的情人？這些在銀幕上，也没有相當的告訴我。</p>
<p>（四）當葉大嫂聽見螳螂乾的訴說：她的丈夫老葉突然亡故的消息以後，她就立刻帶領了她的兒女丨丨珠兒和玉兒一同到老葉斷氣的地方，衆目照彰，大家都看見玉兒是她帶領來的，怎麽當拐子抱玉兒走的時候，一個人也不理？這也似乎太不近情理。</p>
<p>銀海談叢</p>
<h3 id="c276">國片需要着重個性的表演 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 光毅</p>
<p>「大地」的作者白克夫人曾這樣說過：「我們人人各不相同，肯承認這些異點而使之盡量發展者，這便是智慧。」</p>
<p>由此可知，一個人能將他特有的異點，就是他的個性，盡量地發展，他的前途是有無限的希望的。</p>
<p>我們看看外國的演員們，他們都能發揮他們特有的個性的。他們都有他們特殊的風格。警如像依密爾琪寗斯，阿道夫曼殊，希佛萊，卓别靈，這許多人的作品中都表現出他們個人特有的異點。要是將他們的片子換一個人來主演，盡量的模倣原來主演者的動作，我想那出品一定没有原來的那樣深刻，那樣的呌人感動。</p>
<p>所以我說、有個性的表演容易使觀衆感動，給他們一個深刻的印象。若是專講模倣别人，充其量，你不過模倣到九分；你的成功頂多也不能如那人的成功。因爲那人是創造的，而你的僅僅是模倣。</p>
<p>你說瑪麗黛德列是模倣嘉寳嗎？那眞是一個錯誤的觀念。瑪麗黛德列的表演實有好特有的强烈的個性，她甚之於還比嘉寳來得聰明一些。我敢說，若是她全仿倣嘉寳的那樣做，她是不會有今日的成名的。</p>
<p>幾個滑稽明星的特有異點更是顯明的。羅克，卓别靈，裴斯開登的各個不同，也不必我多說了。要是他們表演是互相剽竊的，那麽作們還有什麽價値？</p>
<p>我們國片近幾年的復興運動，很造成了幾部稍有價値的出品。可是内容和表演，常缺乏個性的發揮，而當在模倣國外的出品。這眞是一個不好的現象。譬如兩人見面的情形，分别的情形，哭笑的情形，以及走路的情形，都常在模倣着　　貨。這使得作品内容缺乏充實性。　要看你這盡量模倣的作品，我不會爽快地直接去看來路貨！</p>
<p>我不希望我國的明星變成東方的考爾門，東方的勞萊哈台，東方的克萊拉寳。我希望我們的銀壇裏多産生幾個著重個性的演員，希望他們能成爲世界的明星。</p>

<p>— 蕭蓮</p>
<p>美國電影雜誌Screen　play，最近向五百位職業者徵求在女星中選出一位理想的女子。</p>
<p>這些職業者包含銀行家，律師，醫生，新聞記者，和商店推銷員。他們最歡迎的是瓊克勞馥，梅惠斯脫，琪恩哈羅，露比開萊，凱塞玲海賓，瑙瑪希拉，和貞傑勞傑斯等。他們理想中的女子是一位美麗動人，摩登，和有高等敎育的女性。他們不喜歡像琵琵第特勒克遜（Babe　Didrickson去年亞林匹克的全能女田徑選手這樣强健，但也不愛瘦骨支離的病美人。他們喜歡具有女性美的女子，但希望她們是一些好的伴侣。</p>
<p>五百人中除了一個人，都說他們的理想女子必須有好敎育，全體都要求她必須有幽默的心情。很少人把他的理想女子描寫成一位不會游泳，跳舞，打網球或高爾夫的人。他們希望她必須懂得一點運動。</p>
<p>半數的人說她可以吸烟和飲酒，但不能太過。很少人希望他的理想人物是一位交際花，但在社交上要佔一點地位。</p>

<p>好明星們因爲恐怕身體太肥了，有損美觀，就要設法練身體，讓她們自已瘦些。可是現在好萊塢又新開了一家狗醫院，牠的特别科門是治狗的肥胖。據說狗太肥胖了，一來臃腫不靈，不好看；二來失却運動，容易生病。這種狗送到醫院裏，可以不用禁食的方法，使牠們减輕體重，增加體康。聽說那醫院開辦以來，生意甚爲興隆云。</p>

<p>— 馬騰</p>
<p>勞萊雷瑙德沉思着……她是多天美服，多末情深，多末年輕……芳齡不過十九，而他自已呢，却已將近四十歲了……時光逝去又多末迅速，他神速的思想都追踪不上。他確實是愛　的丨丨無論誰都没有這樣愛過。他所經歷過的女人，着實太多了；他和女人發生愛情，總有百餘次之多。他前後結婚過三次……老實說，那第三個到現在還有確實離婚哩。實勒怎能再愛他，那是終究要使她傷心的。他畢生之錯，决不可再如此錯下去。况且他旣然眞心愛，她亦不能再使她害自已。他决定要喚醒她的幻想，免得演成更大的悲劇。他想盡方法去告訴她，但是她的答覆是什麽？是「我愛你，勞萊；無論怎樣，我愛你。」</p>
<p>「你年紀很輕，世故不深丨」他握着她的玉手，很懇切地告訴她，「我是油都燒乾了。我一生的錯誤，現在祇求你聽我一句話。」可是勞萊話還没有說完，寳勒的嘴唇，已經貼在他的嘴唇上。不讓他說下去了。她說：「我不聽你的話。我愛你。無論你說什麽都不中用。我去告訴我的父母丨和恩納斯丨今天晚上我就告訴他們。」勞萊跳了起來，喊着說道：「不許丨你萬萬不可那樣！</p>
<p>門上吱吱的響着，告訴他們有客人來了。「那是馬克斯」，勞萊說着，去開門了。馬克斯是勞萊雷瑙德的代理人。他一定有好消息帶來了，勞萊感覺着十分的興奮；或者是一張新合同，使他重新恢復他從前在影壇上的地位的。那些易於忘情的觀衆們，他一定要給他們看看，他還没有完結哩！實勒眼瞪着他，表示抗叛以及深切的愛情，默然地走了。</p>
<p>另外一副　叛的眼光注射在派卡德的身上，可是並没有深切的愛情。她高聲道：「喬敦家的宴會，你一定要同我去的。我還要穿了我的新衣服去呢。」派卡德喘着氣道：「不去，不去，我不去。你不記得上禮拜我告訴你的事情嗎？」派卡德夫人道；「不記得！你上一分鐘講的什麽，我都記不得！」派卡德道：「傻子，我不是告訴過你，我想拿喬敦那個公司併呑過來嗎？哈哈，那個大傻瓜現在送上門來了，他自已還不知道呢！有一天他請我到他的公事房去。他後來答應的將他公司的股東名字，抄一張給我。我得了那張名單，就可以按圖索驥，要用多少買多少。從此之後，哈哈，派卡德就是從這裏到熱帶的最好一個輪船公司的主人翁了。喬敦夫人那裏會知道呢。」吉蒂派卡德道：「我不管那些。那個宴會我是一定要去的。我的新衣服，可以看得他們眼睛都落出來了！」（未完）</p>

More than 70% or 80% of Chinese officials and clerks who were able to earn more than 200 yuan per month in the puppet state were dismissed in mid-October of this year. They have now mostly been replaced by Japanese reserve soldiers, with the intention of not only solving the unemployment problem for Japanese but also preparing for all possible wartime contingencies. The Russian side has completed the 6,670-kilometer air route from Haicheng to Jidao, and aircraft can fly at any time.

<h3 id="e22">The Far East Peace Conference. <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>丨丨Araki's Smokescreen for the "Far East Policy" 丨丨</p>
<p>At the end of October, Japanese Army Minister Araki suddenly expressed his intention to shift from a policy of military aggression to advocating the convocation of a "Far East Peace Conference." According to Araki himself, the content of the conference would focus on relations with the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as relations with the Soviet Union in the Northeast. He also intended to invite various Eastern countries, as well as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands to participate. What are Araki's true intentions? There is no need for us to discuss them in depth. All countries in the world, except for a small number of people in Germany who expressed a slight sense of agreement, have generally remained indifferent and have not discussed the matter. This is because they are also well aware that this is merely a smokescreen by Japanese militarists. Even the current diplomatic authorities in Japan believe that the military cliques have acted unilaterally, disregarding the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Uchida Kosai has even advocated "Jiao Shi diplomacy" and withdrawn from the League of Nations, causing world peace and Far Eastern diplomacy to fall into an extremely difficult situation. Why would he suddenly advocate this peaceful proposal? Therefore, they are also skeptical of Araki's proposal this time. Let alone others.</p>
<p>When discussing the Far East issue, China should be the closest party. However, in the past two years, it has formed such an intractable situation. Japan often uses the term "extraordinary times" to rally its domestic population, mobilizing hundreds of thousands of troops and spending more than 40% of its total expenditure on military expenses. The next year may be even more than that. Given this situation, can peace be achieved? Moreover, since the European War, international conferences have mostly been difficult to decide and difficult to implement. The forty-two-to-one resolution on the Three Eastern Provinces issue is an example of this. So why would a European conference be difficult and a Far Eastern conference be easy? Therefore, we speculate that Japan's advocacy of a Far East Peace Conference is simply a variant of the Monroe Doctrine for Asia. It wants to use this to lure China, deceive the great powers, and break open Japan's diplomatic isolation in order to reap real benefits.</p>
<p>The relationship between countries, the so-called diplomacy and peace, is really a relationship in ordinary times. If one only seeks coexistence and mutual benefit temporarily, it can only be a temporary expedient. At most, it can only avoid a temporary bloodbath, and turn it into economic competition. For example, there is no military equipment on the border between the United States and Canada, and there is no arms race between the two countries. Economic relations are carried out smoothly and without hindrance. This is proof that one can sincerely achieve peace in ordinary times. Other countries rarely have this comparison. The current international relations are already not smooth in terms of economic turnover and have caused a major crisis that will lead to future war. It is that countries are nominally friendly to each other in ordinary times, but suspicion has already arisen, and they guard against each other. Even in social occasions, there is an element of reconnaissance. Military preparations are gradually rising competitively. From verbal battles to cannons, from cannons to airplanes and poison gas, it is called armed peace, but in essence, peace is the camouflage for armament. If the military force is unequal, then it will be justified and said that the national economic power and general strength are unequal, and peace is just empty words. Therefore, there is an excuse to expand armaments. However, the power of a country's people is ultimately limited, and natural products are even more defective. Therefore, those who rely solely on force will ultimately find it difficult to achieve the final victory and will eventually suffer the reward they deserve.</p>
<p>Since Japan has difficulty in wooing the great powers and cannot soften our country, it knows that military force is not enough to dominate everything. Therefore, Hirota is in charge of diplomacy and abandons the "Jiao Shi policy" in favor of "reasonable diplomacy." But the actual actions are still the same as before. Does Araki also know that diplomatic isolation is enough to affect Japan's political future? Is the example of Germany before the war not enough? Does the current war crisis need to be repaired? Is the Pacific coast devoid of Japan's friends? Knowing this and wanting to exert its skills, it strives to reduce the opposing forces and break the restoration of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and control it in order to reverse its bad luck. Therefore, the military department came forward and advocated the so-called Far East Peace Conference, one to show the establishment of Japan's Monroe Doctrine in Asia, and the other to raise Japan's international status, to surpass the Washington Conference and dominate the Far East, and to determine the hegemony of the Pacific. However, the countries involved are not fools, so how could they easily be manipulated by it? Therefore, the smokescreen released by Japan will also be seen to be in vain.</p>

<p>French Port: Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov recently embarked here on the American ship "Berengaria" for the United States. The Director of the Information Department of the Soviet Foreign Commissariat and the secretary of the Commissariat are traveling with him. Litvinov did not issue any declarations, only saying that he would make a statement upon his return to Europe. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) With Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov about to arrive in the United States, Secretary of State Hull has stated that the reception accorded to Litvinov by the United States will be no different from that accorded to the ambassadors of countries already recognized by the United States. The State Department will send representatives to New York to welcome him, and Hull himself will personally greet Litvinov upon his arrival in Washington. It is expected that Litvinov will arrive here on the 7th of this month. After disembarking, he will first visit the White House. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is believed here tonight that negotiations on the British war debt and the US government's second step in its currency action plan are nearing completion and should be concluded within the coming week. Then, negotiations on the resumption of US-Soviet relations will begin. Today, the US President spent nearly the entire day dealing with these two matters. While there has been no word on whether there is a connection between the two in the President's plans, the announcement of the meeting between the US President and British Ambassador Lindsay, along with British representative Sir Leith-Ross, coincides with the White House's announcement that it will begin purchasing gold on the foreign market for the first time tomorrow. There may be some clues to be found there. Later, in response to inquiries from reporters, the White House stated that the British representatives' discussions concerned only the war debt issue. However, most journalists believe that war debt talks easily involve the silver issue, as the credit offered by the UK for its war debt payment due in mid-June came from silver purchased from India. However, when reporters asked whether the next payment would still be made with silver and where it would be purchased, the White House spokesperson did not respond. Now that Litvinov has embarked on the "Berengaria" today in Europe and is coming to the United States and will arrive in Washington within the next week, it is clear that the US President wants to resolve the more pressing issues before Litvinov's arrival. Although there has been no indication of an urgent desire to resolve the war debt issue, it is said that he is eager to negotiate some concrete proposals as a basis for future discussions. Today's personal meeting with the British representatives likely involved certain key points that he wanted to resolve face-to-face. Financial and fiscal experts generally say that the war debt and currency issues are closely related, and that the President's discussion of the war debt with the British representatives inevitably touched on the position of gold and currency.

<p>(Washington) Jesse Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), announced today that he has authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to purchase gold overseas for the RFC, starting Thursday, according to the existing plan. The Federal Reserve Bank will purchase foreign currency to exchange for gold, thereby strengthening the position of this foreign currency relative to the US dollar. When the purchased gold is shipped to the United States, the RFC will issue debt notes to purchase it, in the same manner as for domestically produced new gold. Although the gold is actually purchased by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, it is immediately recorded in the RFC's accounts, because the Federal Reserve Bank is bound by the gold standard, while the RFC is not. The amount and circumstances of gold purchased overseas will reportedly be controlled by the White House and the Treasury Department. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) This morning, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation set the gold purchase price at $32.36 per ounce, an increase of one dime from yesterday. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US is currently awaiting the outcome of tomorrow's British Cabinet meeting, where it is expected that the British Cabinet will decide on its response to the US government's request for US-British monetary cooperation. The US government now hopes that Britain will at least adopt a temporary wait-and-see policy, or adopt a very moderate approach. It is generally believed that British cooperation is highly likely because it will take a restrained approach to its operations overseas. Also, the US intends to carefully test its plans to lower the value of the US dollar. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to semi-official statements regarding the current international currency situation arising from President Roosevelt's new plan, there is no question of gold standard countries agreeing to restrict currency exchange. Such an agreement would amount to a partial restriction on the freedom to buy and sell gold and would imply that the gold standard countries are abandoning the stability of their currencies. The "Echo de Paris" newspaper warns the French government not to prohibit the export of cash, as the decline of every currency starts with such a plan. Conversely, raising the discount rate would attract foreign capital to France. The newspaper also advocates prohibiting the issuance of American bonds on the Paris market, arguing that the best way to protect the French franc is to consolidate French finances. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Although there was talk of the US starting to buy gold today, it did not make any purchases in the gold market today. The price of gold was £6 13s 3d, 18 pence higher than the previous day's price. Based on a French franc value of 7950, the US dollar fell here to $4.82375.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's statements clearly indicate that the negotiations between the US and Britain are proceeding satisfactorily. He anticipates that the US's purchase of gold overseas will not cause a conflict between the US dollar and the British pound. This is also the opinion of non-official circles. Regarding the attitude of foreign governments towards the US gold purchase plan, they intend to tolerate it conditionally as long as gold price fluctuations remain within a reasonable range.

<p>(Washington) The American financial community is currently awaiting further clarification from the government regarding its gold purchase plan, while silver advocates firmly believe that the government will soon begin purchasing silver. At this time, only the method of using silver remains a question. Some suggest using silver as a reserve for additional banknote issuance, while others believe that silver coins should be minted. However, these reports cannot be verified in official circles, and officials are particularly reluctant to discuss silver. Currently, there is growing criticism of the President's gold purchase plan. Many politicians and some economic experts claim that the government's true goal is to satisfy both sound money advocates and inflationists, so it is deliberately creating ambiguity and hedging its bets, hoping to gain support from both sides when implementing the plan in the future.

<p>(Washington) Regarding the war debt issue, there is widespread concern that President Roosevelt will not offer any proposals, causing the British representatives to return home hastily. However, according to the latest news, there may be a turning point in this matter. President Roosevelt, British Ambassador Lindsay, and British financial representative Sir Leith-Ross conducted talks yesterday, and further talks are possible. A communique issued after the talks stated that the meeting today was intended to find a compromise solution to the debt issue, and that talks will continue. At present, there is no definite solution. The issue of the US purchasing cash in Britain was not discussed. While British diplomatic circles acknowledge that some progress has been made in these talks, their tone is not as optimistic as that of the American side. It is said that neither side wants to act hastily, and that a friendly atmosphere is necessary for a successful resolution, and that a public break must be avoided. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Roosevelt Optimistic About Progress of Recovery Program; Overseas Gold Purchases Will Help Raise Prices; Midwestern States Demand Currency Inflation <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The US President expressed optimism today about the recovery plan, coupled with the visit to Beijing by the governors of the western states to demand immediate and substantial currency inflation. Therefore, it is now believed that the US government will soon issue a clear statement on its monetary policy. Mogens Thogersen, head of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), stated that the overseas gold purchase mechanism has been fully organized, and that if today were not a bank holiday in England and France, purchases would have already begun. The US President stated that he felt that the recovery plan, including currency, unemployment, and sales aspects, was making progress, that the situation had truly improved, and that he hoped it would continue to improve without ceasing. He also hoped that the overseas gold purchase initiative would help raise prices. However, neither the President's remarks nor Thogersen's statement immediately clarified the doubts caused by the overseas purchase plan. Although many businesspeople believe that the President wants to lower the value of the US dollar in the foreign market, no one can definitively say so, so all businesses cannot stabilize until the government issues further clarification. Regarding currency inflation, the Republican states in the Midwest supported Roosevelt's election last time. It is questionable whether Roosevelt can now reject their demands. Now that the governors of Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and North Dakota have arrived in Beijing today, demanding immediate currency inflation and no longer considering the fate of the US dollar in the foreign market, and suggesting other measures beneficial to farmers, it is believed that the President will soon issue a clearer statement on monetary policy. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(New York) According to top-level sources, President Roosevelt, after reviewing the charts he received showing the increase in the number of employees and the total amount of wages paid, felt that the national recovery program was progressing very well. According to Labor Secretary Perkins, the average increase in hourly wages has increased from 42 cents to 51 cents, and the average decrease in weekly hours has decreased from 42 hours to 36 hours. A special report by government economic experts stated that the rebound in the production of certain key industries was the result of overproduction from March to July and was definitely not due to a lack of demand. The US President believes that the increase in jobs and wages and the decrease in working hours are the result of the serious work of the National Recovery Administration (NRA). According to the latest charts, the prices received by farmers, as of October 11, had increased from an index of 40 to 52, while the prices paid by farmers had increased from 68 to 77. NRA official Swarthmore warned the government that if the government did not take on stricter supervision of industry itself, the NRA would do so. Swarthmore has now put forward a program to make the work of the NRA permanent. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>Manchuria - Confirmed information: The double-tracking project of the 7,000-kilometer Siberian Railway has been completed as a result of the Soviet side's day and night construction efforts due to the new situation after the Manchurian Incident. The construction of branch lines has now begun.

<p>(Harbin) Manchukuo Foreign Affairs Commissioner Shi Luben and the Russian Consul General will again engage in a diplomatic dispute over the Russian consulate's speedboat transporting gold bars. According to Manchukuo sources, a certain Russian agency in Heihe loaded ten gold bars into a speedboat of the Soviet Russian consulate and transported them to Hailand Pao on the Russian side. If this news is confirmed, Shi Luben will lodge a serious protest with the Soviet Russian consulate. It is reported that Soviet Russia has privately established docks and several speedboats in Heihe, specifically for transporting Soviet Russian personnel and diplomatic documents to Hailand Pao. Passengers on this boat are not subject to customs inspection, so there are reports of smuggling gold bars. At the same time, the meetings held by the Russian and Manchukuo directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) have so far made no progress. The biggest reason is that the two directors have failed to reach an understanding on the sovereignty of the locomotives withdrawn into Russian territory, so the meeting cannot proceed until this issue is resolved, as both directors deny the other's sovereignty. Another issue is the restoration of transportation at the Manchuli and Suifenhe stations. At the same time, the Manchukuo authorities' refusal to release the arrested Russian employees is also hindering the progress of the meeting. On the 24th of last month, the head of the freight station, who was arrested for assisting in the withdrawal of vehicles into Russian territory, was placed in solitary confinement, further worsening relations between the two sides. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>(London) A report received here today from the British Commercial Commissioner stationed in Rome states that Italy is now realizing a newly organized social and economic life, the purpose of which is to transform industry according to the cooperative system, and that striving for production and seeking profit for the country is the fundamental doctrine. All strikes and factory shutdowns are illegal. All disputes are subject to compulsory state arbitration. The most noble feature is that national prosperity is due to the concentration of the happiness of farmers. Since the Fascist Party took power in 1922, 300 million British pounds have been used for land reclamation, water conservancy, road construction, public works, and farmland. At the end of last year, 1.35 million demobilized soldiers and their families were relocated to reclaimed land. The new town of Littoria, formed by filling in the Pontine Marshes with a huge project, has had 7,500 residents since its completion in December last year. Although the national expenditure is very short, it is striving to avoid borrowing foreign debts, so foreign debts are very small and the currency price is very high. The optimism of the people is also very admirable. Recently, major industries have reduced wages by 20 to 40 percent, but the people of all walks of life trust themselves and Mussolini very strongly.

All items excavated from each pit, such as pottery, bone fragments, and shells, are recorded for their location and depth from the ground, separately preserved and wrapped, and then cleaned before being identified. Most of the items found on the 24th were pottery shards, a deer antler about half a meter long, a conch shell, and a bone arrowhead. In the eastern section of the third pit, a human skeleton was found. At the western end, a round hole with a diameter of about six inches was discovered, filled with a large amount of loose, gray-black soil. I believe that this place was originally a residence and later became a base before being transformed into farmland. The red soil found in the second pit is likely the location of a stove. The round hole in the third pit, filled with ash, is the stove's chimney. The large number of conch shells and clam shells were a favorite food of the people who lived here. These items are also abundant at Chengziya and the Yin Ruins in Anyang. The bone arrowhead was one of the weapons used at the time, because before the Warring States period, during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, metal was scarce, and stone and bone artifacts were numerous. It was not until the late Zhou Dynasty, during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, that bronze became prevalent, and arrowheads were made of bronze. Based on this, the age of the site can undoubtedly be determined to be from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. As for the human bones, because they were very close to the surface and the bone structure was disarranged and incomplete, they were likely the remains of a reburial. It is unfortunate that there are no epitaphs or steles to provide evidence for research. In the future, all the bones will be sent to Beiping to the paleontology technician Mr. Yang Zhongjian to study the ancient human races and ancient animals. The entire project is still in its initial stages. After the excavation is complete, all the information about this place, where the houses were, where the kitchens were, the doors and courtyards, and the entire layout of the courtyard, will reveal the lives of the ancient people, their architectural art, and further extrapolate to history and culture. Its contribution will be far from superficial. Dong also said that they get up at 6:00 am every day, have breakfast at 10:00 am, start work at 8:00 am, rest and have lunch at 12:00 pm, continue working at 1:00 pm, and stop working at 5:00 pm for dinner. Each person makes a brief report on the day's work. The total working time is eight hours per day. In addition, twenty people are hired to dig pits. Their wages are 30 cents of silver per person per day. The work at this site will be completed in about thirty days. The depth of each pit, unless there is a special discovery, will be dug to the yellow soil layer. The work in Zou and Yi counties is expected to complete all the survey procedures in Zou County this year. The excavation period will be carried out simultaneously with Yi County next spring. The construction in Teng County will definitely be completed within the year.</p>
<p>On the 25th, the excavation reached the 15th pit, and bone awls, stone knife fragments, and stone axe fragments were found. There were also many holes in each pit. In addition to broken pottery shards, there were also bronze arrowheads, which were already decayed and only about an inch long, with a square head and a biased prismatic shape.</p>
<p>On the 26th, the 17th pit was continued, which is the place where the local people unearthed Zhou Dynasty bronzes this spring. On that day, Dong also told the reporter that the working area north of Anshang Village, we will tentatively call it the "Anshang Site". The locals call it Gutuiding (Mound Top) because the gray soil is higher than the ground and forms a mound. We have only been working for three days, and our observations are still very rough. Generally speaking: (1) The scope of the site is the same as previously mentioned; (2) The search for the site, the result of opening seventeen pits in three days, can be inferred: (A) The ground level at that time was about 70 to 80 cm below the current ground level; (B) There were small round pits with a diameter of six or seven inches and a depth of four or five inches on the ground at that time, filled with black ash and charcoal, which resembled stoves; (C) There were large round pits with a diameter of four or five meters and a depth of more than one meter next to the stoves. It remains to be studied whether these round pits were used for living or storage; (D) At a depth of 20 to 30 cm below the cultivated soil, a soil platform resembling a house foundation was discovered; (3) The collection of artifacts. The artifacts are mostly found in the ash layer, scattered and discarded, with no order to be found. Pottery shards are the most numerous, but they are also too fragmented to form complete vessels. The artifacts unearthed today can be divided into six categories: (A) Pottery: Tripod legs are quite numerous. There are also fragments of Dou, Lei, Zun, and Yi vessels. The most noteworthy is the black pottery shards that are similar to those produced at Chengziya, which are also found here, but the shape is thicker and coarser, not as refined as those produced at Chengziya, and the patterns are simpler, without text, which is their unique feature; (B) Bone artifacts: There are bone arrowheads, bone awls, and flat needles with holes; (C) Stone artifacts: Stone arrowheads, stone sickles with holes, stone chisels, and stone knives are particularly noteworthy. The shapes are all similar to those unearthed at the Yin Ruins; (D) Shell artifacts: There are shell sickles and knives with serrated edges, very similar to those produced by the lower-layer black pottery culture of Chengziya; (E) Bronze artifacts: Only bronze arrowheads and bronze scraps are seen; (F) Animal bones are not very numerous, but there are also deer antlers and wild boar teeth.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 27th, traces of ancient tombs were discovered underground at the "Anshang Site". According to Dong's determination, it was briefly stated that on the afternoon of the 27th, while continuing to excavate the 17th pit, a ditch dug by the Chen Shangfu brothers this spring was discovered, and the disturbed soil was taken out, which was the original pit dug by the Chen family to find Zhou Dynasty bronzes. To the west of the pit, at a distance of four inches from the ground, traces of a coffin and half a human skeleton were found. The skull and upper limbs were missing, and only the leg bones remained. Fragments of the skull were found in the disturbed soil, which was probably destroyed by the Chen brothers when they were digging for antiquities. It can now be determined that this is a tomb, and the steel artifacts unearthed in the spring were burial objects. The steel artifacts were in a pit about eight or nine inches from the ground, with a section of matting next to it, with decayed wood blocks and debris on it. The burial bronzes were arranged in order here. There is also a large tree, with branches at the top, about four meters long, lying horizontally in the soil from west to east, probably used to cover the coffin and burial objects. The original form and scope of the tomb are currently under discussion. Director Wang (Xiantang) previously suspected that the Zhou Dynasty bronzes unearthed from this place were stored in wooden boxes. Now this problem has been completely solved. They are burial objects, not storage objects. The following two points can prove this: First, any storage of ancient objects must be in a place where people once lived, and the architecture is commensurate with the artifacts. When the pit was first opened, large and small round pits were discovered, but there was no large-scale architecture on the ground, which we found very strange. Now we know that these fourteen heavy artifacts (the tripods, plates, Yi, etc. from the spring) are objects from the tomb and have nothing to do with the site. (2) When the bronzes were first discovered, there were still complete fish bones in the tripod. It is said that there was also a bone in another tripod, similar to a lamb leg bone. There is no reason to store food and utensils together. Therefore, based on our excavation and research, it can be determined that the Zhou Dynasty bronzes discovered in the spring were indeed burial objects and not storage objects. Our initial purpose in excavating this place was to find clues to the relics of the Small Zhu State from the bronzes discovered in the spring and to compare them with the relics of the ancient states of Teng and Xue. According to our current investigation, this place (Gutuiding) was already in ruins before the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, so the people of the Small Zhu State sought this higher mound as a burial place for their ancestors, and it is not the site of the Small Zhu State. According to the burial situation here, it is quite similar to the tombs in Xincun, Junxian, Henan, which was the atmosphere of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Such things as wooden frames, mats, and red paint were all customs at the time. It is determined to be the tomb of a noble of the Small Zhu State. The relationship of this person to the burial bronzes may be found in the inscriptions on the bronzes. Later, the tomb was turned into farmland and gradually leveled, and then discovered by the Chen Shangfu brothers. Our future work here will continue to excavate in order to find the contents of the site, such as large and small round pits and all the artifacts, pottery shards, bones, stones, etc. Even a small thing can be investigated for its origin. In our eyes, its value is no different from precious bronzes, and it can arouse our great research interest. At the moment, we are starting to wash the pottery shards, bones, and other miscellaneous items that have already been excavated, immediately numbering and registering them one by one and noting the location of the pit from which they were unearthed and the depth from the ground, and then comparing and studying them separately. As for the Anshang site, in addition to excavation work, I also tried to investigate and collect ancient steles and inscriptions and investigate the establishment dates of villages near this site as evidence. For example, at the western end of this village, there is a Laojun Hall (temple, now more than half collapsed). In the late Song Dynasty, a Taoist named Chao Ranzhi built a house here and called it Xiuzhen Temple. During the Zhengzong period of the Yuan Dynasty, his disciples began to rebuild it as Laojun Hall. The oldest inscription on the stele was erected in the tenth year of the Ming Dynasty, and the names of the villages that donated money to build this hall are engraved on it. There is no Anshangyi among them. In the early Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, there was only the name Anshangyi. An'an and Jun are the same. Later, An was called An. I further investigated the Chen family's tombstones and learned that their distant ancestor, Chen Yingke, came here at the end of the Ming Dynasty, and there are now fifteen generations. This village has no other surnames. The Chen family can be regarded as a representative of the patriarchal society of our country. Knowing that the Chen family came in the late Ming Dynasty, it can be inferred that the opening up of the nearby mountainous area, the leveling of Gutuiding (Anshang site), and the appearance of the bronze tomb were all the work of the Chen family. This is also extremely relevant and interesting material in this excavation of antiquities.</p>
<p>At the same time as Gutuiding, the Caowang Tomb was also being excavated. Work began on the 26th, because the tomb had been uncovered by local people with three stone pits. Mou Xiangnong, Pan Ke, and Liu Xuepeng each guarded one pit, hiring fifteen workers in total. The daily wage was also 30 cents of silver. Mou guarded the first pit, Liu guarded the second pit, and Pan guarded the third pit. Each led five workers. The first two pits are on the top of the mountain and are relatively close. The third pit is slightly farther away and is at the northern end, and the terrain is also relatively low. The yellow soil and stones in each pit had been almost completely removed by the 30th. The structural forms of the three pits are different. Generally, the front part is a stone chamber, and there is a square hole in the ceiling above the chamber. It is a kind of black stone building. Viewers can descend from the ceiling along the ladder. The height can meet the top. The rear part is the tomb, which is two holes. In the middle, there may be flat stone pillars or large round stones lying down. There are no inscriptions. The depth of the front chamber of the first pit is 1.9 meters. There is a small stone chamber on the left and right of the car, probably for placing the burial objects. The horizontal stone above the tomb has a fish-shaped pattern carved on it, which is very rough. The depth of the front chamber of the second pit is 1.8 meters, and there is only one small stone chamber on the west side. The pattern of the square victory shape is also not exquisite. The third pit is slightly larger than the previous two pits, with a depth of 2.2 meters. There are two small stone chambers on the east side, which communicate with each other, separated by prismatic small stone pillars. The stone pillars of the entire pit are the same. According to Pan Ke, this kind of prismatic stone pillar has a Western style, and the pattern is also fish-shaped. The tomb door on the west side has been broken. According to Mou Xiangnong, the daily work situation and the estimation of the discovered items are briefly stated that since we started work on the 26th, we have not seen anything except rubble and yellow soil excavated from each pit. On the 27th, the work of lifting stones and taking soil continued. In the morning, five stones were dug out of the yellow soil and rubble. One of them was carved very finely. In the afternoon, a broken piece of a "pot" was dug out under the stone pillar in the pit. On the morning of the 28th, the bottom of the tomb was already visible, all of which were stone bottoms. Many pottery shards, a lead hairpin, a broken sword, and the mouth of a broken bottle were dug out in the front chamber of the tomb. More than one broken five-zhu coin and a piece of the roof of a burial object were discovered. On the 29th, it was Sunday, and we rested as usual for one day. As of today (30th), a total of fourteen five-zhu coins, a broken sword, a lead hairpin, two roofs of burial objects that can be connected completely, which are also pottery, and many other broken pottery shards and bones have been obtained. According to our speculation, it can be determined that this place must have been the tomb of a noble at that time. There must have been other great buildings above the ground, such as sacrificial halls and sacrificial pavilions. Now the stone foundation is still there next to the first pit, and there are many Jing Tong around the cemetery nearby, or they were buildings at that time, which were destroyed and moved later. According to the pottery manufacturing, carving patterns, five-zhu coins, lead hairpins and other items, it can be determined that its era was indeed the Eastern Han Dynasty. As for the bones excavated, they cannot be used as a basis, because these three pits have been excavated by people, and it is unknown how many times they have been through. The original bones have long been lost. In the future, if we continue to excavate the tombs next to it, or get epitaphs or carved characters on the stones, and then combine them with the overall research, we can fully understand and know it. Now, if we only speculate based on one corner and one thing, I am afraid that there will be some differences from what is expected in the future. Today, only the stone soil in the second pit has not been completely extracted and cleaned, which is considered a stage. At the moment, we are planning to open other tombs and pits. We will discuss with Committee Member Dong about where to start first, and then we can start excavation. (October 30)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Qingdao Agricultural Products Exhibition - 30,000 Farmers Participate - Shen Honglie Attends and Delivers a Speech <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence. In order to promote the improvement of rural agricultural products, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, together with the Agricultural and Forestry Office, held an agricultural products exhibition to compare and improve and appointed Zhou Yaqing, the head of the agricultural affairs section of the Agricultural and Forestry Office, and Yuan Lixiu, the director of the agricultural and commercial stock of the Social Bureau, as the chief and deputy directors of the preparation committee. In advance, they ordered the construction offices of each township to earnestly collect products and send them to the exhibition for display. They also sent letters to various places along the Jiaoji Railway to solicit special products for reference. This exhibition of agricultural products has received more than eighty kinds, more than two thousand items, which were held at 10:00 am on October 30. The exhibition will last for three days. The venue is set up in the Licun Farm. In the middle is a lecture stage, and on both sides are the agricultural product exhibition areas, which are divided into five departments: (1) Agronomy Department, (2) Horticulture Department, (3) Animal Husbandry Department, (4) Forestry Department, (5) Pest and Disease Department. All kinds of agricultural crops and specimens are collected in each department. About 30,000 farmers participated. After the opening ceremony, Ge Jingying, the director of the Rural Office, chaired the meeting and reported the significance of the opening ceremony, briefly stating the purpose of this agricultural products exhibition: (1) To improve agriculture by scientific methods; (2) To collect various agricultural products, compare and observe, and use them as specimens for improvement; (3) To enable farmers to have a clear understanding of new agriculture and use it as a reference. After the report, Mayor Shen Honglie delivered a speech, briefly stating that today's agricultural products exhibition is the second time that Qingdao has held such an exhibition in six or seven years. More than two thousand agricultural products have been received, which shows that farmers are very interested in this. I have a rare opportunity to say a few words to you. First, it is necessary to study agriculture in the Jiaozhou area, because the soil of each township in this city is mostly barren and the area is extremely small. Even in Licun District alone, there are only more than 37,000 mu of cultivated land, but the population is more than 70,000. According to the average calculation, each person only gets half a mu of land. Agricultural products are already lacking and insufficient to maintain life. In the future, the population will increase day by day, and the land allocated to each person will also decrease day by day. Farmers' lives will be impossible to maintain. Therefore, in order to relieve farmers' suffering, it is necessary to improve agricultural products and increase production efficiency. Second, methods to improve agriculture: A. Select seeds. If fruit seedlings, vegetable seedlings, etc., are not selected good varieties, the harvest will not be abundant. The Agricultural and Forestry Office has very good honey peaches. The price of peaches is four or five times higher than other varieties. It is possible to imitate planting. Also, Licun is suitable for pears, and the Zhan Mountain area is suitable for grapes, so the selection of seeds should also vary according to the terrain. B. Eliminate pests. If pests occur in fruit trees, the harvest will be reduced and must be removed. For example, last year, the pear trees had cow and sheep hair mites, so the pears did not mature. This year, the township construction office provided medicine to spray pesticides for prevention. As a result, the pears were full of fruit, and the harvest was doubled compared to previous years. It is estimated that the total income from pears alone this year is about 600,000 yuan. At the moment, the Agricultural and Forestry Office has set up a pest and disease department to specifically prepare to eliminate pests for various agricultural products and strive to increase production. Third, methods of planting land. Agricultural improvement is not only a matter of excellent seeds that can be perfectly solved. Operating technology also has a great relationship, but our country's farmers are stubborn and old-fashioned and unwilling to apply new methods. At the moment, the Agricultural and Forestry Office has established a promotion and experimental area in various townships to rent farmers' land for experiments. Farmers have a considerable understanding of all the achievements, and we will continue to add to them in the future to make it easier for farmers to observe, so the new method can be promoted without hindrance. In addition, I would like to mention two things: 1. I hope that farmers in various departments will plant more fruit trees, because the income from one mu of fruit trees can be worth 20 mu of good land. In the future, if fruit trees are promoted, the income of this city will naturally increase. 2. I hope to plant more vegetables. The Agricultural and Forestry Office has good seeds of vegetables that Westerners like. If we can imitate planting and supply them to foreigners, the annual income will also be considerable.</p>
<p>The exhibition will be held for three days. There will be agricultural lectures and costume lectures every day to impart agricultural knowledge and distribute publications so that farmers can spread the information and gradually change their self-enclosed mentality. As for the farmers who come to the exhibition to visit, the guidance personnel of the association will explain in detail, so the farmers are all happy. (October 31)</p>

<p>丨Southern Fujian Opposes the Incorporation of Local Troops丨</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence. Jiang Guangnai, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, went to Guangdong on the 19th of last month for his son's wedding. Now that the task is completed, he will return to Fujian by boat from Hong Kong on the 4th of this month. According to those close to Jiang, after Jiang returns to Fujian, there will be a major innovation in politics: 1. Urge Dai Ji to come to Fujian immediately to take over as Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, so that I can specialize in the position of Chairman of the Provincial Government and coordinate the overall situation. 2. Divide the six counties of Shaowu, Jiangle, Shunchang, Shaxian, Qingliu, and Mingxi in northern Fujian into post-disaster areas and establish post-disaster committees to handle all local affairs, imitating the Lansi method. 3. First, establish administrative inspector commissioners in the four districts of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Xinghua in southern Fujian, and Funing in eastern Fujian to promote local politics and abolish the security command in the area, and merge the regiment affairs into the commissioner's office. 4. Implement the new ocean rice import tax, ship tax, and land consolidation plan recently passed by the provincial government to increase financial revenue. 5. The draft articles of association of the Provincial Bank have been reviewed by the provincial government, and a fund of 900,000 yuan has been raised. It is decided to open the bank in January of the 23rd year of the Republic of China to circulate social finance and support the development of industry and commerce. It is expected that the political situation in Fujian Province will have new changes in the short term. The Pacification Office recently appointed Weng Zhaoyuan as the commander of the Xingquan Yong bandit suppression, and plans to incorporate the ten armies of various parts of southern Fujian. At present, the people of southern Fujian hold different views on this. Yesterday, groups such as the Jinjiang County Party Department sent a telegram to the Pacification Office and the Provincial Government, saying that the three counties of Xingquan Yong have been suffering from bandits for a long time. The burning, killing, and looting are unspeakable. This time, personnel are dispatched to plan for bandit suppression, and the people of each county are supporting it. However, everyone knows that the bandits should be suppressed. In the past, Tan Shuqing, Fang Shengtao, and Gan Maobu dared to incorporate bandits into the army and plant their power. As a result, the measures were ineffective, and the bandits still occupied the area and claimed to be heroes. Not only did they harm the people as before, but they also became more severe, and the people could not bear it and wanted to die with them. Last year, the 19th Route Army came to Fujian, and the military power caused the bandits to collapse. However, the remnants harassed, and so it is today, multiplying each other and causing harm. The past is like a period, and the same mistakes can be learned from. I beg you to thoroughly suppress the bandits and save the people from the fire and water. It is deeply requested. However, the matter has been implemented, and I am afraid it will be difficult to stop it. (November 1)</p>

<p>Changsha Correspondence. The seven counties of Zhijiang, Qianyang, Huangxian, Huitong, Jingxian, Suining, and Tongdao in western Hunan, adjacent to Guizhou and Guangxi, are far from the provincial capital and have always been occupied by indigenous chieftains. Although they are nominally under the jurisdiction of the Hunan Provincial Government, they are actually within the sphere of influence of the heroes of the Hunan-Guizhou green forests. In the past, Chen Hanzhang, Chen Wo, He Jingcheng, Yao Jiyu, and others were all based in these seven counties to develop their power. The provincial government could not reach them, and the transportation was inconvenient, so there was nothing to be done. He Jian recently sent Li Jue's department of the 19th Division to defeat Chen Wo and recover Zhijiang, and established the Fourth Security District Command in Hongjiang, with Li Jue as the commander, and these seven counties as the area of jurisdiction. Four regiments of provincial troops were dispatched to be stationed regularly, intending to fundamentally destroy the power of the indigenous chieftains. A rehabilitation office was established in the district command to promote politics with military power. Yesterday, the provincial government committee meeting on the 27th decided to entrust Li Jue with the task of handling the rehabilitation affairs of the seven counties in western Hunan and appointed Peng Zhuo as the director of the rehabilitation office, who will handle the rehabilitation of civil, financial, educational, and construction affairs in the seven counties in accordance with Li Jue's orders. The measures for the rehabilitation of officials in the counties of western Hunan prescribed by the provincial government are recorded as follows: (1) The commander of the 4th Security District shall temporarily handle the rehabilitation affairs of the seven counties of Zhijiang, Qianyang, Huangxian, Jingxian, Huitong, Suining, and Tongdao under his jurisdiction in accordance with the orders of the Hunan Provincial Government. (2) The rehabilitation matters of civil affairs, finance, education, and construction in the counties listed in the preceding article shall be handled by the county governments under the supervision of the district commander, but major matters shall still be submitted to the Hunan Provincial Government for approval. (3) For the convenience of handling rehabilitation, the district commander shall set up a rehabilitation office in the district command, and the district commander shall issue documents to the outside world in his name. (4) The rehabilitation office shall have one director, who shall manage the affairs of the office and direct and supervise the staff under his command in accordance with the orders of the district commander and the guidance of the chief of staff. (5) The rehabilitation office shall have five staff members. (6) The director and staff members shall be appointed or commissioned by the Hunan Provincial Government upon the recommendation of the district commander. (7) The rehabilitation office may establish a number of clerks and secretaries in accordance with the complexity of the affairs. (8) The detailed rules for the rehabilitation office shall be formulated separately. (9) The rehabilitation office shall be abolished when the rehabilitation affairs of each county are completed. (10) If there are any unfulfilled matters in these measures, the district commander may submit them to the Hunan Provincial Government for revision. (11) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Hunan Provincial Government. (October 28)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Anhui Provincial Department of Civil Affairs Prepares to Establish a Bureau for Opium Suppression 丨 Following the Example of Hubei Province and Considering Implementation丨 <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Anqing correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Government recently received an order from the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces to implement a six-year opium prohibition plan. It also issued regulations to subordinate areas for registering opium addicts and strictly prohibiting them from smoking; strictly banning the sale of narcotic drugs and closing opium dens; and strictly prohibiting the planting of opium in inland provinces and banning the purchase of opium produced in border areas. Among these regulations, those concerning the issuance and renewal of licenses and the collection of license fees, as well as restrictions on opium dens, stipulate that the provincial government should designate a competent authority to handle these matters. The Anhui Provincial Government has decided that the Department of Civil Affairs will be the competent authority and will establish a bureau within the department to specifically handle opium suppression affairs throughout the province. The Department of Civil Affairs has also drafted organizational regulations for the opium suppression office and a provisional budget. The proposed organization of the office is based on the model of the Hubei Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, with some adjustments. The budget is approximately two-fifths less than that of the Hubei Provincial Department of Civil Affairs' opium suppression office. It has already been approved by the provincial government meeting on October 27th, and the establishment is expected to occur soon. (October 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e100">The Issue of Establishing a Local Court <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>A local court was established in this county during the early years of the Republic of China. However, judicial affairs were abolished when Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor and were handled by the county government. It was not until the previous year that a county court was established. The Jiangsu Higher Court and other courts previously planned to establish local courts in all counties, and this county was included in the plan. Yesterday, Lin Biao, the president of the Higher Court, visited Songjiang to inspect the prison and detention center. He discussed the establishment of a local court with County Magistrate Jin, Court President Wang Sixian, and Chief Prosecutor Zhu, which would have jurisdiction over the five counties of Songjiang, Fengxian, Jinshan, Qingpu, and Nanhui, as well as the original plan to build a prison. The construction drawings and material cost estimates had been submitted to the Higher Court for review and approval by the Judicial Administration Department. In addition to allocating funds from the surtax on legal documents, the construction costs were still significantly insufficient and would require local fundraising. The fundraising methods have not yet been decided and will be discussed with County Magistrate Jin and submitted to the Prison Improvement Association for deliberation and implementation. Finally, he inquired in detail about the Songjiang Bank bankruptcy case and the work of the liquidation office. He returned to Shanghai by night train and is reportedly scheduled to inspect other counties.</p>

<p>Ni Yugan, a 22-year-old man from Yangzhou, came to Suzhou five years ago to work as an apprentice at the Runchang Foreign Machinery Store at No. 5 Yejia Lane outside Changmen. He had already completed his apprenticeship and earned an annual salary of 100 yuan. He was hardworking and thrifty and highly valued by his employer. On the 20th day of the previous lunar month, he returned to his hometown due to his mother's illness. He returned to Suzhou on the 27th and went to the store on the 30th. That night, he went to his mother's place at Wuhu Bridge to borrow 90 yuan, claiming that he had been forced to death outside Panmen and asking them to collect his body. The store found the message suspicious and sent someone to investigate. They found Ni's body in the river there on the morning of the 2nd. His hands were tied with lead. The local bailiff reported the case to the local court for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e103">The Sea Wall in the County is in Critical Condition, Requiring Substantial Funds for Repair <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Nanhui County area suffered two typhoons last month, damaging over 40 li of the coastal sea wall. Thanks to strenuous emergency repairs at the time, a complete collapse was averted. Plans are now underway for repairs, but the project requires more than 140,000 yuan. County Magistrate Yuan Xiluo is seeking funds locally and requesting appropriations from the province. The details are as follows: The county suffered the most severe typhoon damage in recent years. The disaster-stricken people lacked food and clothing and were in dire need of assistance. The Sichuan-Southern Chongbaoqi Five County Flood Relief Association, the Pudong Association of Compatriots, and various charitable organizations such as Huayang Yizhen raised and distributed relief rice, clothing, and seeds. The local government and gentry also raised funds to provide economic relief. County Magistrate Yuan Xiluo, considering the severe damage to the county's sea wall, urgently needed repairs and convened local gentry for discussions. It was decided to implement a work-relief program. The most critical Litang section would be repaired this year, and the Wanggongtang Port would be dredged to clear water sources. In addition to raising funds locally, a request for subsidies would be submitted to the provincial government, as the two major projects of repairing Litang and dredging Wanggongtang Port required a substantial 140,000 yuan, which could not be fully raised locally. On the 30th of last month, County Magistrate Yuan Xiluo, accompanied by Construction Director Ling Zhibin, went to Zhenjiang to meet with Provincial Chairman Chen Guofu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs Gu Renfa, Director of the Department of Finance Zhao Dihua, and Director of the Department of Construction Shen Baixian to personally report on the critical situation of the Nanhui sea wall and request provincial funds for repairs to implement the work-relief program this winter. Yuan and Ling returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that the provincial government will submit the matter for discussion at a meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e104">A Solution Has Been Found for the Debts of the Huisheng Factory <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The absconding of Xi Huian, the owner of Huisheng Silk Factory, due to debts, has caused complications, including disturbances by female workers and the smashing of counters at the Chamber of Commerce, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the County Chamber of Commerce has provisionally formulated three solutions based on various opinions and investigations into the factory's situation: (1) The Silk Factory Association should supervise the factory personnel left behind to verify the worker accounts and, according to Xi Huian's letter, first sell the eight bales of silk in storage and the by-products and raw materials in the factory to pay wages. If this is insufficient, the 417 bales of dried cocoons of Ruichangrun, Xinchunqian should be sold, as the warehouse receipts were used to secure loans from firms. These loans should be deducted first, and the remaining funds should be used to supplement wage payments, and the workers should be dismissed. The Silk Factory Association will be responsible for these matters. (2) It has been found that, in addition to the Ruichangrun, Xinchunqian cocoons used for wages, the factory has 141 bales of Ruichangrun summer and autumn cocoons, 2,080 bales of Yixin autumn cocoons, and 318 bales of Xiesheng autumn cocoons, totaling 2,539 bales of dried cocoons. All warehouse receipts have been used to secure loans from various banks and money shops, totaling 19,915.19 yuan from Jiaotong Bank, 8,013.54 yuan from Xingye Bank, and 16,226.44 yuan from Duanchangrun Bank, plus 14,000 yuan from Changzhou Taicheng Bank and 6,100 yuan from Yutong Bank, for a total of 64,255.17 yuan. Now that the factory has ceased operations, the banks and money shops should consider the market conditions and sell the cocoons to settle the loans. Any remaining funds should be held in trust by the banks and money shops and distributed equally among the creditors in the future. However, the amount of dried cocoons used by the machines should be reported to the Chamber of Commerce and the silk factory and cocoon industry associations at any time, and personnel should be sent to check the quantity and weight. (3) According to the list sent by Xi Huian and the subsequent report from Chicheng Coal Company, the factory owes another 4,114.50 yuan for coal and other debts. If there are any remaining funds, they should be distributed equally. The zero-lot cocoon holders should be informed to return to their hometowns for the time being and not wait in the city. The Chamber of Commerce can only handle the matter on a fair basis. If creditors have other claims, they can submit them to the authorities for verification. The above measures were sent by the Chamber of Commerce to the parties concerned yesterday for joint implementation. At the same time, in view of the previous disturbances by female workers, the Chamber of Commerce has specifically requested the county government to pay attention and suppress any disturbances at any time. Zhou Wei, the representative of the factory staff, sold the silk in the factory according to Xi Huian's letter and obtained 4,851.668 yuan to pay the first installment of wages. When this was learned by creditors such as Li Xiaocheng, they argued with Zhou, leading to a fight and mutual wrestling that were brought to the first sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau for settlement. It is also reported that more than a dozen workers from Xi Huian's hometown (Zhoutang Town, Jiangyin) have occupied his home to demand debts, which has not yet been resolved.</p>

<p>The county government has repeatedly instructed various trade associations to switch to the new system of weights and measures as soon as possible. Industries such as silk and cloth have complied with the order, but the rice, bean, and miscellaneous grain industries have delayed implementation due to the new measures not yet being manufactured. Recently, the county government ordered the two industries to switch to the new system for all scales and measures from November 1st, and no violations would be tolerated. The two industries, after receiving the order, felt that the new system was smaller than the old system, about 94 percent of the old standard. If implemented, the related expenses of warehouse rent, water transportation, measuring, and labor costs would inevitably be reduced accordingly. They have submitted the difficulties to the county government, requesting consideration and overall planning, and calling relevant parties to determine a balanced solution. At present, the new measures have been manufactured, and implementation can begin as soon as the county government agrees on a solution.</p>

<p>The Jiaxing Hangzhou Customs sub-office has been established for decades. The Ministry of Finance has now ordered the Hangzhou Customs to close the Jiaxing sub-office. Local businesses were alarmed upon hearing this. If the Jiaxing sub-office is closed, the local products exported from Jiaxing and its surrounding areas will have to be reported to the Hangzhou Customs, which will have a significant impact on both time and expense. To maintain the convenience of exporting local products, the County Chamber of Commerce has resolved at its 14th executive committee meeting to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to revoke the decision and exempt the Jiaxing sub-office from closure.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the resignation of Finance Minister Song Ziwen, the new Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has formally taken office. According to inquiries with banking circles yesterday, neither the financial nor financial markets were affected in the slightest during the transition between the two finance ministers, so everything remains the same. There are no changes. The 20 million yuan treasury bills from the Song Ziwen era have already been allocated for bandit suppression military expenses. It is expected that the Ministry of Finance and the banking community will not have any new contacts in the near future, as the strength of the national banks and commercial banks can no longer bear any more burdens. However, it is difficult to predict at this time whether the new Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi will have any policies to discuss with the banking community in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Writes to Domestic Manufacturers to Reduce Prices of Domestic Goods <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Goods are Eliminating Themselves without Boycott The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce wrote to domestic manufacturers yesterday, stating: "We received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation on the 1st of this month, stating that at the second meeting of our membership congress, a proposal from the Sisui Town Chamber of Commerce stated, 'Foreigners price their goods very cheaply at the beginning, without considering costs or profits. Later, after their businesses develop, they gradually increase prices to seize huge profits. Chinese merchants do the opposite. Once goods are sold, they calculate all costs and profits, regardless of whether they sell well or not, and set an extremely high price. This is why foreign goods flood the market and domestic goods sell poorly. To revitalize industry, it is necessary to persuade all manufacturers to reduce the value of domestic goods. If we cannot recover our rights and interests, we will be ruined.' The proposal was immediately submitted to the congress for discussion. Everyone agreed that although domestic goods have shown rapid progress in recent years, foreign goods still flood the market because foreign goods have low costs and low prices, while domestic goods have high costs and high prices. This has led to the trend of foreign goods being dumped. If all major manufacturers can reduce prices, consumers will be happy to buy domestic goods given the weak economic situation of the people. In this way, foreign goods will eliminate themselves without a boycott." It was resolved to record the case and send a letter to your association to handle it. We hereby record the case and inform you, hoping you will handle it accordingly. It is indeed a good way to reduce the selling price of goods so that customers are happy to buy them and easily promote sales, thereby resisting the dumping of foreign goods. Following the previous letters, we have written subsequent letters to notify you, hoping you will investigate and handle it, and also widely persuade and adopt this principle to all domestic manufacturers under your jurisdiction. We earnestly expect this.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, in recent years, the export aspect of China's foreign trade has gradually decreased, while the import aspect has increased year by year.

As for the situation of China's foreign trade in the first half of this year, both exports and imports have generally declined, with imports declining even more. The Central News Agency reporter specially inquired with He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, at the bureau yesterday. He explained in detail the reasons for the decline, and his remarks are recorded as follows.</p>

<p>In the first half of this year, the sharp decline in China's exports has been mentioned above. At the same time, the number of foreign goods imported has also declined sharply. As a percentage, the decline in foreign goods imports is even greater than the decline in domestic goods exports. However, comparing the number of exports and imports in the first half of this year, the trade deficit is more than 5,517,000 yuan. The trade deficit for the same period last year was 30,818,900 customs taels, which is equivalent to 48,015,846.7 yuan. The biggest reason for the sharp decline in foreign goods imports is due to the decline in the purchasing power of the Chinese people. The increase in import tariffs is also a reason.</p>

<p>When the reporter continued to inquire about what measures could be taken to relieve the sharp decline in exports, the response was that relieving the sharp decline in exports is a very big problem that cannot be described in a few words. The domestic rural economy has gradually declined, resulting in a decrease in productivity, which has affected exports. Therefore, the fundamental relief measure is to adjust rural finance and encourage production, but this cannot be successful in a year or two. He then discussed the establishment of a special bureau for trade with Russia by the Ministry of Industry, but there are still no new developments.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association received an official document from the Jilin General Command reporting on the Japanese governance policies and the general situation of the Righteous Army's work in southern Jilin. The document stated, "Reporting on the matter of forwarding reports: It is humbly reported that Zhang Jidong, representative of the Provisional Second Army, reported on behalf of the army commander Song Guorong, stating that Long Tu arrived in the defense area from Ping yesterday, reporting on the rear area situation and that the General Command and this army have requested assistance from the Shanghai Relief Association. A directive has been received approving assistance and instructing the Command to allocate rewards from the planning expenses. Upon hearing this, I am overjoyed, like sweet rain after a great drought. I immediately notified all officers and soldiers and explained to the soldiers that the committee members of the Command did not spare any effort and enthusiastically appealed on behalf of our unit. The officers and soldiers were extremely grateful upon hearing this, and their spirits were greatly lifted. Please convey our unit's gratitude to the committee members on behalf of the officers and soldiers and request the Command to distribute the funds as soon as possible for distribution to the soldiers and purchase of shoes and socks, which is of utmost importance. As for the recent work situation of our unit and the Japanese governance policies in Manchukuo, I humbly present them below for the General Commander's review. (1) On the night of September 8th, the Zhao Er Brigade, under the command of Regiment Commander Mao, destroyed over a hundred *li* of the Jihai Railway from Qichai River to Xiaochengzi, completely destroying the roadbed and rails, preventing traffic for five days. They then attacked the Seventh District of Yongji County, killing a Japanese support team including a major and eleven soldiers, as well as six puppet soldiers. Our unit was thirty-five *hua li* from the walls of Jilin. Due to a shortage of ammunition, we were unable to advance further. On September 23rd, we laid siege to Panshi Hulan Town for the second time, killing the pro-Japanese captain Gao Xijia and over ten soldiers, as well as over twenty Japanese reinforcements. Some firearms were captured, and some were recovered. Our side suffered over thirty officers and soldiers killed in action and many wounded. (2) Regiment Commander Wu led his unit and the three battalions of the General Headquarters Guard to besiege Huadian and Guanmachang on May 3rd. Due to the tight defense by the incumbent regiment commander and the Japanese, they besieged for a day and night. Later, they were attacked by Japanese reinforcements and were unsuccessful. Our side suffered one battalion commander and four soldiers killed in action. (3) The Commander-in-Chief led the staff of the headquarters and the troops of Regiment Commander Cao in a battle with two hundred or so members of the puppet guerrillas and the Japanese command on Shanche Mountain in Panshi on September 16th, killing over twenty Japanese and puppet officers and soldiers and capturing many horses. Our side was unharmed. (4) Regiment Commander Cao led his unit to destroy the railway south of Kaoshan Village on October 5th and ambushed trains and armored vehicles, killing five Japanese soldiers and four puppet railway police. Our side suffered four officers and soldiers killed in action and four wounded. (5) Since the ceasefire, the puppet state has been clearing out internal troubles in the hinterland of the puppet capital. They plan to send the Jing'an Army and other troops to eliminate the Volunteer Army. Our army lacks ammunition and is under great pressure. We selected a number of personnel to replenish the troops of that unit and carried out propaganda for over ten days. Yang Lianfu, an officer of that unit, killed four Japanese soldiers and led a full platoon of soldiers, along with a machine gun, to Long. Just as that unit was about to stage a major uprising, the Japanese discovered it and quickly transferred the unit back to its original defense area. Furthermore, a company of Yu Zhishan's troops is currently stationed in southern (6) The current Japanese governance policy in Manchukuo is to alienate the Volunteer Army from the people."</p>
<h3 id="e125">After Eight Rice Dealers Cancelled Contracts for Private Purchase of Japanese Rice, the Association Resolved to Temporarily End the Matter <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the case of eight rice dealers, including Yongda, purchasing Japanese rice in this city has been subjected to public condemnation. Although they have already announced the cancellation of the contracts and compensated the American merchant Handao Lai Foreign Firm for a loss of 10,000 yuan, all sectors believe that they are to blame and advocate for further punishment to serve as a warning. The city's Grain Food Committee recently held a meeting and resolved to instruct the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association to convene its own meeting to decide on a punishment method. The resulting fines will be allocated to the warehouse fund. It is now learned that the Miscellaneous Grain Association has already replied yesterday, stating that they were indeed unaware of the Japanese rice purchased by the eight rice dealers beforehand. They only knew that it was Saigon small-grained rice handled by the American merchant Handao Lai, and they purchased it because it was cheap. However, after the Japanese rice was discovered and warned by the Association, they immediately complied with the order to cancel the contracts and compensate for the losses, which amounted to 10,000 yuan. The Association has now notified its members that they must not knowingly violate the rules and purchase it privately for profit. Otherwise, once discovered, they will immediately be expelled from the Association and announced to all sectors, and everyone will abandon them. As for further punishment, given the current commercial decline and economic panic, which have reached an extreme point, it seems that it is indeed difficult to bear. Therefore, it has been resolved to temporarily end the matter.</p>

<p>The Provincial Shanghai Middle School recently purchased over four *mu* of farmland in the Wujiaxiang area of Caoding District in western Shanghai, along the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus route, as the school's new site. It submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior, which was forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau to be handled in accordance with Article 4 of the Land Acquisition Law. Upon learning of this, the farmers were panic-stricken. They jointly petitioned the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Education, and the Ministry of Interior, requesting the revocation of the order and the finding of another location to protect the farmers' livelihoods. To date, no instructions have been received. Unexpectedly, the farmers received a notification from the Land Bureau the day before yesterday and were extremely angry. They went to the head of the district, Zhu Jinyu, and the local warden, Jin Ziwei, to make a scene. Zhu and Jin were unable to persuade them and had to lead the masses to the Caohejing Town to petition Municipal Council Member Yang Xinzheng. For a time, men, women, old, and young, formed groups of no less than two hundred people. The district head and others explained the above situation, stated their intention, and requested to be accompanied to the Land Bureau to petition. Municipal Council Member Yang explained in public that the Land Bureau was acting on orders in this land acquisition. Since you have already petitioned the Ministry of Interior, you can wait quietly for instructions. Why bother wasting your work to make a pointless request? I do not approve of this. He repeatedly enlightened and persuaded the masses to return, promising to discuss appropriate solutions with the authorities. At five o'clock, the farmers finally returned.</p>

<p>The Oceanic Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region, as the fishing season is approaching, besides ordering its affiliated naval vessels, including the Biao Hai, Hai Jiu, Hai Jia, Qing An, and Hai Ying, to set off to protect the fishing in different areas, discovered extortion by bandits. Yesterday, they issued a special public notice to fishermen, urging them to report such incidents to nearby naval vessels for detention. The public notice stated, "Public Notice: Now that the fishing season has arrived, it has been found that unscrupulous bandits are secretly extorting fishing boats with bandit business cards. Such illegal behavior should be severely apprehended to quell the banditry. Therefore, this public notice is hereby issued, urging all fishermen to be aware that if they encounter bandits who dare to extort fishing boats again, they may immediately secretly report them to the naval vessels of this bureau for detention and strict punishment. Let each be informed of this. Director Yuan Lianghua, November 1st, Year 12 of the Republic of China." Furthermore, the Ministry of Industry, due to the numerous obstacles encountered in the collection of fishery construction fees, specially revised the existing collection regulations. In the past, the buyer paid the fees. Now, the seller pays the fees, and the levy is changed to 2% of the value, an increase of 10%. The matter of collecting fees in Shanghai is currently under mediation.</p>

<p>The labor dispute at the No. 1 factory of British-American Tobacco Company in Pudong, involving over 3,000 workers, has not been resolved for half a month. The Fourth District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for arbitration. At the same time, they received instructions from the Municipal Party Headquarters, ordering the branch office of the British-American Tobacco Factory to order all workers to resume work first and await resolution. The Union then relayed the order to the branch office of the British-American Tobacco Factory. After receiving the order, the branch office immediately convened an emergency meeting of member representatives to discuss the resumption of work. They resolved: (1) to comply with the orders of the higher authorities and notify all workers to reluctantly resume work from tomorrow; (2) to submit all labor and management terms to the Municipal Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union for submission to the Municipal Government for arbitration; (3) to issue a declaration of resumption of work to clarify the truth to all sectors; (4) to send representatives to negotiate with the management on the resumption of work matters. At 7:00 AM yesterday, all the workers gathered at the factory gate. Zhou Xuexiang, a member of the General Labor Union, and representatives of the Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union persuaded them. At 9:00 AM, all the workers entered the factory to resume work. The order was quite good.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Again to Expedite Import Tax on Foreign Rice; If Delayed Further, Farmers Will Find It Even More Difficult to Survive <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, urging them to expedite the import tax on foreign rice. The original text stated, "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: We have investigated that the domestic late rice crop has already entered the market, but foreign rice continues to be dumped at low prices. It is reported that the small-grain rice sold in Fujian Province, including the province's rice tax of one yuan per *shi*, is only sold for six yuan and eighty-five cents. This will increasingly crowd out domestic grain, until it is no longer able to survive. Since the rumor of a famine last year stirred up society, public opinion at the time strongly advocated levying heavy import taxes on foreign rice. It was only because of objections from rice merchants in Guangdong Province that the authorities, for the sake of prudence, postponed implementation. Fortunately, Guangdong first created a foreign rice tax, and the resistance has been removed. If there is further delay, the decline in this year's agricultural production will inevitably be even worse than last year, and farmers will find it even more difficult to survive. We do not avoid presumption and telegraph to your departments for your review and approval, humbly requesting that the import tariff on foreign rice be implemented immediately to alleviate the suffering of Jiangsu farmers for the public good. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3 id="e131">Japanese Minister Actively Lobbying for Renewal of Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement; After Termination of Agreement, Japanese Goods Exported to China Plunged; Dropped from First to Third Place; Japanese Circles Currently in Great Panic <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports that, according to a Japanese newspaper yesterday, since the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement expired in May of this year, the Chinese government has not continued to sign with the Japanese side. On the one hand, the new tariff regulations have been implemented, resulting in a great blow to Japanese goods exported to China in the past six months, with a very large impact. Therefore, Japanese banking and business circles are quite uneasy. They all believe that this matter is related to the lifeline of Japanese commerce. Therefore, Japanese Minister to China Arichi Akira has repeatedly gone to the capital to meet with Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, to request continued signing, etc. A Xinxin News Agency reporter has learned from relevant sources that Japanese goods exported to China used to account for the first place in imported goods from various countries. Since the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement was terminated, our country, in order to protect domestic products, has implemented an autonomous tariff policy. Japanese goods exported to China have been treated as goods from non-treaty countries. As a result, the current import of Japanese goods has dropped from the first to the third place. Therefore, Japanese circles are in great panic, fearing that if this is prolonged, the situation will inevitably be unbearable. Therefore, they are actively lobbying our National Government, hoping to achieve the objectives of the agreement and restore the original state of Japanese goods exported to China. However, it is learned that the authorities of our government are well aware of the advantages and disadvantages and have long decided to adhere to the autonomous policy, not showing any retreat from any enticement or threat, and choosing their own destruction.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Dispute Between Sanshan Guildhall and Cooperative Association <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Sanshan Guildhall sent a letter to this newspaper stating, "Dear Editor, I have read the full text of the facts announced by the Cooperative Association in your newspaper. The announcement is grandiose and designed to dazzle people, but in fact, it is far from the truth. Our guildhall does not want to remain silent, and we are hereby submitting a letter of rebuttal, hoping that it will be published in your newspaper to clarify the truth. On September 21st of this year, the National Goods Introduction Center entrusted the Yongshengtai Customs Brokerage Firm to load sixteen pieces of cloth onto the Yihe Steamship Company's Jiesheng Steamer to the Suzhou Branch. Subsequently, the brokerage firm telegraphed Fuzhou, prohibiting the consignee from picking up the goods, saying that our guildhall had ordered the brokerage firm to obstruct the goods by telegram, etc. The key elements of an order are coercion and intimidation. Yongshengtai has the freedom to operate, and there is no specific contract with our guildhall. It took the initiative to send a telegram to return the goods. How can it be called an order? Even if the firm complied with our guildhall's request and sent a telegram, it was simply like a rabbit mourning for a fox, unable to bear to see the colleagues of our guildhall being oppressed by capitalists and going bankrupt, making an unjust cry. Furthermore, on October 23rd, the National Goods Introduction Center entrusted the Sanbei Public Freight Company to transport 131 pieces of cloth, which were loaded by Sanbei Freight Company. However, the announcement stated that the Sanbei Company stated that it could not be loaded without the permission of the Sanshan Guildhall, etc. After investigation by our guildhall, the center used altered customs documents to falsely declare and transport the goods, which was discovered and rejected by the Sanbei Company. However, the announcement claimed that the Sanbei Company was coerced by the Sanshan Guildhall to refuse to load the goods. What a clever trick of embellishing words and covering up faults! The facts are all there and can be verified without difficulty. Since the center claims to introduce national products, its sole aim is to guide the people to enjoy using national goods, to widely introduce them so that the industry strives to manufacture and the business circles strive to purchase and sell, and everyone enthusiastically purchases and uses them. However, the center is not trying to do this, but instead invests in purchasing goods that are already selling well and transports them to areas where they are already widely used, so that the industry has nothing to strive for, the business circles have nowhere to strive, and the seekers have no power to purchase. Looking at what is stated in its announcement, 16 pieces of cloth were loaded to Fuzhou on September 21st, and 131 pieces of cloth were loaded to Fuzhou on October 22nd. These cloths had already been promoted and sold by the colleagues of our guildhall for many years and had a long-standing reputation, without the need for the center's introduction. The industry is only continuing what it already does, and the business circles will eventually lose their jobs. Moreover, in various parts of Fujian, the residents are thrifty and simple and have always loved using national goods. Since the 19th Route Army was stationed there, they have long implemented a policy of only using national products. The National Goods Introduction Branch was established this year, while the colleagues of our guildhall have been purchasing and selling national goods for many years. It uses the name of national goods introduction in name, while we use the name of national goods sales in practice. Now, it is introducing in name and profiting in practice, competing with the colleagues of our guildhall in business, not hesitating to slander people with destroying national goods, inciting hatred and fishing for profit, accusing people of illegal oppression, and provoking discord. Examining the center's achievements, the goods are limited to fast-selling cloth, the area is limited to Fuzhou, where national goods are actively purchased. The reality of national goods introduction is completely lacking. It has already made merchants in Shanghai and Fujian sigh for lack of food. In the future, if they continue to follow their original intention and rely on their financial strength to compete with merchants in various industries in various places for a day's advantage, national goods manufacturers will not need new development, the people will not have new knowledge, and merchants who rely on buying and selling for a living will be successively unemployed, and there is even a risk of bankruptcy. This is not the fault of national goods introduction, but the fault of using national goods introduction in name to take away people's jobs in practice. Before leaving, I feel indignant and implore you to allow publication so that those who are scheming will not hide the shortcomings of others to show the evil of their strengths, and the propaganda will be deceived, then I will be fortunate. This is addressed to the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, attached with a reply to the National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association. (Note: See a brief report by a Japanese reporter on the Fuzhou Sanshan Guildhall, dated October 31st)."</p>
<p>The China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association sent a letter to the Sanshan Guildhall stating, "Dear Editor, we have received and respectfully read your reply. Regarding the various sections on monopoly and illegal obstruction of transportation, your guildhall has denied them. Our association's duty is to promote national goods and strive to develop the industry to save the country. All those who advance towards this goal are our friends, and all those who unreasonably destroy it are our enemies. The situation of your guildhall's obstruction of national goods is clear to everyone. Our association does not want to waste any more paper and ink and redo a pointless argument. However, the facts are where they are, how can they be concealed? Now, we will further explain the truth of the matter. (1) Regarding the matter of ordering the Yongshengtai Customs Brokerage Firm to send a telegram to Fuzhou to prevent the pick-up of goods, when the firm was forced to send the telegram, the Yihe Shipping Bureau, fearing legal issues, ordered the firm to issue a formal document, which is now stored at the shipping bureau and can be used as evidence. Also, on that day, the Yongshengtai Customs Brokerage Firm was acting as an agent for the Meisheng Customs Brokerage Firm in re-reporting the agency transport. Upon receiving a telegram from Fuzhou reporting the stoppage of delivery, our association immediately interrogated the firm, ordering it to truthfully reply. Subsequently, it approved a letter stating that Yongshengtai said that it was because the Introduction Center had not joined the Fuzhou Cotton Cloth Gang Sanshan Guildhall, so the guildhall interfered with the customs firm and needed to return the goods. Our association exists, so how can your guildhall deny knowing? The Yihe Shipping Bureau also has a statement regarding this case, which is also available to our association. (2) Regarding the Sanbei Company's refusal to transport, the company's manager Yu formally stated to the Introduction Center's manager Shi that he could not issue a customs declaration without the permission of Mr. Wang of the Sanshan Guildhall. What can your guildhall say in defense? (3) Regarding the refusal to load the China Merchants Bureau steamer, what do you mean by 'passive self-defense'? What kind of oppressive behavior did the China Merchants Bureau engage in that made your guildhall have to defend itself? This is truly what is meant by trying to cover up the truth, and yet you still say that it is not contrary to the law or reason? With this, we respectfully wish you good health. China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association, November 1st."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company strike has been deadlocked for more than a month and has not been resolved. The labor side has decided to convene a general meeting today to discuss countermeasures and issue a declaration. The Public Works Department replied to the General Labor Union yesterday, hoping that the strike would be resolved soon. Various other documents have been issued, which are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Convening a General Meeting and Issuing a Declaration <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth District Water and Electricity Industry Union, because after the electricity strike occurred, the labor side has repeatedly made concessions, but the company authorities have not sincerely accepted the workers' demands, causing the strike to drag on for more than a month and still not be resolved. In order to discuss practical countermeasures, it has been specifically decided to convene a general meeting of all members at the Ximen Republic Theater at 9:00 AM this morning and issue the following declaration: Since all the workers were forced to go on strike, it has been more than a month. Although there has been enthusiastic assistance from all sectors and goodwill mediation from all parties, the company has maintained its consistent policy and firmly refused. Recently, internal machinery has gradually been damaged, and panic is increasing, but they still do not seek a reasonable solution. Instead, they use detectives and send out cars to forcibly pull workers, intending nothing more than to destroy our workers' unity in order to achieve their ambition to destroy Chinese workers. Regarding the cause of this dispute and the progress, the workers and the General Labor Union have repeatedly announced it clearly to all sectors of society in the newspapers, and everyone has a deep understanding of it, so there is no need to explain it again in detail. However, in order to express the firm attitude of our workers, we will take this opportunity to reiterate a few words for our colleagues from all sectors. The result of a month of peaceful struggle has not resulted in the company's slightest consideration, so in the future, we can only continue the policies we have always adopted and the goals we have repeatedly declared, and continue to fight to achieve the final victory. This is our declaration.</p>

<p>The Municipal General Labor Union, believing that the situation of the electricity strike is becoming increasingly serious and that if a solution is not quickly found, an unexpected incident will inevitably occur, sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, requesting that the company be ordered to quickly seek a solution. The union received a reply from the Public Works Department yesterday. The original was in English, and is translated and recorded below: In reply to your letter regarding the serious situation of the electricity strike and requesting mediation, etc., this bureau has immediately sent a copy of your letter to the Electric Power Company for consideration. This bureau sincerely hopes that a reasonable solution to the strike can be obtained in the shortest possible time. Please be advised. He Dejin, Public Security Co-Organizer, October 31st.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Letter from the Taxpayers' Association to the Public Works Department <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, we have received the letter from the 20th District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation and the United Business Association of the Fourth District on October 14th, stating that since the electricity strike in the Public Concession occurred, all sectors have been uneasy. It is like what US President Roosevelt recently said to capitalists in his country, "Only see your own interests and disregard people's lives." There is a growing trend to force expansion, because what the company authorities see is only profit, and the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce is not even in their eyes, let alone our suffering Chinese workers. Your association's letter to the Public Works Department, requesting it to control them, is righteous and stern, revealing the hidden and exposing the covered, and it is truly admirable. This is indeed a true representation of the residents within the boundary. Last night and this morning, the Shanghai Electric Power Company published a public letter in the newspapers at a huge cost. On the surface, it seems that the company is reasonable in everything, not only is there nothing right about the workers, but also the opinions of public organizations, such as the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's declaration and your association's letter, are also considered to be inaccurate, untrue, or intended to confuse observers. It is truly like what is said in the New Testament, "Only see the speck in other's eyes, but not see the log in your own eyes." Our association is not talented, but dares to refute each of its points separately in order to correct the audience. We inform your association: (1) Regarding the electricity price of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the exclusive agreement stipulates that the original electricity price set by the Public Works Department's Electricity Department should be regarded as the most fair price, and should gradually be reduced in the future. The price increase began on January 1st of last year. The reason was that the price of coal was high. Now, the price of coal has been reduced by half, and it is being dumped, almost half of what it was when the price increase was requested. Then should the Electric Power Company, which uses Japanese coal, not request a price decrease? The price increase is only 3.6%, which is really deceiving. Try asking if adding one cent to a penny is equal to adding 9.09%. Why say only 3.6%? With just this one point, the company's letter has lost its authenticity. It is also said that the wages of Chinese employees have increased by 2.06%. Then the company has made a comparison as follows: (A) The original income was 10 million tons, plus 3.6%, which is 360,000 taels. (B) The original expenditure on wages was 100,000 taels, plus 20.6%, which is 20,600 taels. It is sufficient to prove that electricity prices and wages cannot be compared with each other. (2) This article does not need to be debated in detail. Just look at the company's use of White Russians, which is enough to see the falsity of what it says. Proving that the monthly salary of foreigners is more than 100,000 taels, while that of Chinese is only more than 10,000 taels, is even more difficult to believe. (3) Regarding bonuses, those who are fired are not given them, and those who resign are not given them. Consider that there are only two ways for workers to leave the company, and yet they are not given bonuses. Then the bonuses in words and orally, no matter how great, are no different from empty promises. (4) The accuracy of the meter reading is only a one-sided statement. It must be like the mint's production of coins and the bank's banknotes, organizing a public committee to review them before people can fully believe them. As for the lawsuits for stealing electricity, they still come from the teachings of your association. Try asking if the power outage to our member Lao Yan Maoyuan, which caused the closure of his business, was a court decision? In general, the so-called true evidence of the company is only one-sided before a permanent review committee is established. The matter concerns public interests. We urge your association to continue to urge the Ministry to intervene from the standpoint of all taxpayers and not allow the words of the aforementioned Roosevelt to continue to be an iron fact. Sincerely wishing you public friendship, etc., we respond to your bureau and handle the case together.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>We acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th of this month regarding the recent labor unrest. We understand your concerns. Yesterday, we had the pleasure of a visit from Mr. Ding Dixing, Chairman of your esteemed association, which allowed our company to explain our position on this matter in person. We are most grateful for this opportunity. However, there is one point in your letter that we would like your association to consider carefully, namely the statement that "many of our members are experiencing difficulties in their business due to delays in installing lights and connecting electricity, resulting in various customer dissatisfactions." Our company has stated to Mr. Ding that the absence of a few employees will absolutely not cause any inconvenience to any customer or contractor. If your association is aware of any customer or contractor who has experienced inconvenience due to this incident, please provide us with detailed information so that we can investigate thoroughly. Our company has always taken excessive measures to ensure that electricity supply is not delayed for any new customer. We would be grateful if your association could notify us of any such inconveniences as they arise, so that we can pay attention to them.</p>
<p>We are replying accordingly for your information.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Jardine Matheson Stevedore Workers' Union Club and Seamen's Union Suspend Activities <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the wage dispute of the Jardine Matheson stevedore workers is difficult to resolve due to the refusal of various compradors to sign. The Seamen's Union believes that there is a background to the workers' slowdown, so it has suspended the activities of the Jardine Matheson Stevedore Club and dismissed the instigating staff. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Deadlock Between the Two Sides: The Jardine Matheson stevedore workers launched a slowdown at the end of last month due to their unfulfilled demands for improved treatment. Subsequently, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union submitted the matter to the company for negotiation. The company accepted the three conditions put forward by the workers, and all the workers immediately resumed work. However, the dispute broke down again due to the refusal of various compradors to sign. After the seamen's branch and others tried their best to suppress the situation, the slowdown was not repeated. The last mediation convened by the Social Bureau failed to proceed due to the absence of the labor representatives. The two sides are currently still in a deadlock.</p>
<p>Club Sealed Off: The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union recently learned that after the deadlock in the Jardine Matheson stevedore workers' wage issue, Wang Zhifu, a standing committee member of the Jardine Matheson Club, secretly colluded with the compradors, intending to betray all the workers. In order to protect the interests of the workers, the committee decided the day before yesterday (the 1st) to dismiss Wang Zhengfu, seal off the club, and prohibit its activities, and to negotiate with the Chinese Shipping Mutual Aid Association on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Dismissal of Staff: The Seamen's Union also believes that the stevedore workers' slowdown was instigated by Zeng Shanren, a member of the staff council, which is considered to be in violation of the law. Therefore, the union dismissed him and notified its subordinates. The original text reads as follows: "Notice: Zeng Shanren, a cadre of this union, instigated the stevedore workers of Jardine Matheson to stage a slowdown and secretly sent a letter to the company to threaten them, the evidence is conclusive. In addition to submitting the matter to the 14th committee meeting of this union for a decision to dismiss him, he will not be allowed to engage in activities within the scope of this union in the future, in order to punish him and avoid further incidents. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is issued to inform all subordinate associations."</p>

<p>Planned jointly by the three bureaus and the Xingye Trust</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the construction of the city center has been proceeding with unremitting efforts recently. In addition to the new municipal government building and the main roads in the area, which have been completed one after another, water, electricity, telephones, and transportation will also be completed soon. Recently, the municipal government will also start all public facilities. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Construction of Staff Dormitories <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>After the municipal government and its subordinate bureaus and offices move in on New Year's Day, the municipal government will find ways to move all subordinate officials, whether or not they have dependents, to the city center. Therefore, the municipal government has instructed the Xingye Trust to build two types of dormitories in the city center: individual dormitories and dormitories for those with dependents, sufficient to accommodate all employees, so as to facilitate the application of each employee. The plans for these houses are</p>
<p>already being drawn up in preparation for construction.</p>

<p>Since all the staff of the municipal government will be able to move in, all public facilities must be prepared by the competent authorities as soon as possible, such as schools, vegetable markets, and other places to sell goods necessary for daily life. The Municipal Affairs Conference has approved the plan and handed it over to the Bureau of Health, Education, and Finance to jointly plan with the Xingye Trust as soon as possible. These bureaus will begin consultations and proceed with the arrangements within days and will resolve them all within the year, so as not to affect the relocation.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Disaster Situation in Haimen County, Jiangsu Province <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received Xu Lisheng and other representatives from Haimen for disaster relief. According to them, Haimen has suffered from two hurricanes, and the severity of the disaster is no less than that of Chongming, Nantong, and Baoshan counties. The government's disaster relief has not been taken into account, and no investigations have been conducted. Now that the cold winter is approaching, the disaster victims are waiting to be rescued. They are begging for funds for disaster relief and attaching a disaster relief appeal. It reads as follows: "Our Haimen eastern part is low-lying, bordering the Yellow Sea to the east,毗 Dong to the south, and connecting to the Tonghai Kenmu Company to the north. On September 2nd and September 18th of this autumn, we suffered two hurricanes, with torrential floods pouring in. Cotton, beans, miscellaneous grains suffered heavy losses, especially the stone dikes, cement dikes, and cement and wooden sluice gates along the north and south Yellow Sea coast were destroyed, and their losses are even more severe. As for the Wang Yang Village case, numbers seventeen, eighteen and nineteen along the coast bordering Qidong, and the Bei Shouqian, Huai Dong Village, Lu Chuijing, Yang Xiangpu and other cases in the north, the圩 dikes were also completely destroyed. The houses in the圩 were mostly collapsed, and the old and weak were submerged. The cries shook the fields for a time, how miserable it was! At present, the tidal disaster suffered is salt water, and it is necessary to store fresh water for three or four years before planting can be harvested. If you want to store fresh water outside the圩 and plant inside the圩, you must first rush to repair the圩 to be the fundamental plan. Also, our western Haimen, along the Yangtze River line, east to Qidong and west to Nantong, suffered the same disaster, destroying 圩 dikes and houses, and drowning people, slightly similar to the coast. According to the survey, the affected area along the coast is about 137,600 mu, more than 2,240 houses collapsed, more than 8,400 embankments were breached, more than 140 people were drowned, and the loss of grain was more than one million yuan. More than 20,000 disaster victims are waiting for relief. Our association's temporary relief for disaster victims will be discussed with Kenmu Company and Mr. Liu of Nanxun to provide emergency relief once. As for winter and spring relief, and building embankments, the measures of working in place of disaster relief and treating both the root and the symptoms, Haimen still has no supporting capacity. Therefore, we describe the disaster situation and send representatives to respectfully beg for help from various charitable organizations and major philanthropists. We sincerely hope that you will show great compassion and generosity, so that the disaster victims in our Haimen along the Yangtze River and the sea can extend their lives on a single thread. We are very grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e145">High Court Rules No Need to Transfer Communist Suspect Case; Presiding Judge Orders Police to Detain Suspects for 24 Hours; Public Security Bureau and Municipal Council to Negotiate Administratively <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau previously arrested four communist suspects, Chen Yuxiu, Xie Xinming, Xu Jian, Xie Zuoyu, and others, at No. 45 Dalu New Village, Shigaota Road. However, the police station on Dixiwei Road detained Chen and others and sent them to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court because Shigaobei Road, which the Public Security Bureau passed through, was an extra-territorial road. The dispute over jurisdiction between the two sides was intense. Some time ago, Judge Yu of the Second Branch of the High Court visited Dalu New Village in person to investigate the situation. All the details have been recorded in our newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled for continued hearing. At 10:00 a.m., Judge Yu Hua of the Criminal Division, accompanied by two prosecutors, Zhou Han and Jiang Shuzi, ascended to the Criminal Division One court. Li Zhishan and Gan Jingxian, lawyers for the Municipal Council, Zhan Jifeng, legal counsel for the Public Security Bureau, and Yue Junying, the defendant's defense lawyer, were all present. First, lawyer Zhan Jifeng stated that the most important jurisdictional issue in this case, which this lawyer believes, has been investigated by your court in person. It should be clear whether Dalu New Village is in the Chinese or Concession area. The defendant and others founded the Chinese-language Xinbao in Batavia, which contains many reactionary articles. The Batavia Party Headquarters petitioned the Central Government to issue an arrest warrant. Therefore, the defendant's criminal behavior is obvious. He then presented the Xinbao and other evidence. Judge Yu declared that the jurisdictional issue should be resolved first today, and the evidence can be submitted later. Lawyer Zhan immediately asserted that Dalu New Village was indeed in the Chinese area. Lawyer Li Zhishan also stated that Shigaobei Road is currently under the administration of the Municipal Council Police Department before a solution has been reached by the diplomatic authorities. Dalu New Village is a dead-end lane. If the Public Security Bureau is to perform its duties, it must pass through this road. Therefore, your court has jurisdiction. Even if it is determined that it is indeed in the Chinese area, according to the law, the Jiangsu High Court should request an arrest warrant. If the court believes that the jurisdictional issue must wait for a solution by the diplomatic authorities, then it should order the release of the defendant. Lawyer Zhan then replied that the land of Dalu New Village is outside the extra-territorial road. The tap water, electricity, and building permits of the village are all supplied and issued by the Chinese authorities. There is no doubt that it is in the Chinese area. The police station's lawyer said that the Suzhou High Court should request the transfer of the case and the Public Security Bureau has no right to request it, which is wrong. If this is the case, then the Public Security Bureau can be abolished. The Municipal Council argues that since the exit of Dalu New Village must pass through the extra-territorial road of the Concession, the Municipal Council can manage it accordingly. Then, the location of the City Chamber of Commerce is surrounded by the Concession on all sides. Whether it is the front or back door, it must cross the Concession. Why does the Municipal Council have no right to manage it? Moreover, there has never been such a road in the Yangjingbang regulations. Lawyer Li then attacked the Public Security Bureau for not following the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, first issuing an arrest warrant or search warrant from the court. He cited various legal provisions as the reason for his attack. Lawyer Zhan immediately stated that the Public Security Bureau's arrest of the defendant was in accordance with the orders of the superiors. If the procedure is indeed inconsistent, the higher authorities will correct it themselves, and the Municipal Council does not need to overstep its authority. The two sides debated each other. The jurisdictional issue was debated for quite some time. Judge Yu then announced that the court would adjourn for deliberation. After deliberation, he still took the seat and announced the ruling in the main text: "Chen Yuxiu, Xie Xinming, Xu Jian, and Xie Zuoyu are not criminals found in the Public Concession. This court does not need to transfer them. The bail money is returned." After the ruling, Lawyer Zhan immediately stated that the court had ruled that the defendant was not a criminal found in the Public Concession, but was forcibly detained by the Municipal Council. Now that your court has the right to accept the case, I am deeply afraid that the police station will release him. Then, the important criminal will escape. Who will be responsible? Therefore, at a minimum, the police station must detain the defendant and send him back to Dalu New Village to restore the original state. However, the Municipal Council disputed this again. Finally, Judge Yu verbally announced that the police station should temporarily detain the defendant for 24 hours, and the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Council should conduct administrative negotiations to seek a solution. If a solution cannot be found within the time limit, the defendant should be sent back to Dalu New Village to restore the original state. However, it is heard that the Municipal Council will execute the ruling.</p>

<p>At dusk on October 15th, 1929, a few robbers suddenly drove a car to the back gate of the British Bank on the Bund No. 6 when the market was closing. They got out of the car and rushed into the bank, broke into the accounting room. Two robbers each held a pistol, frightening and prohibiting the staff from speaking out. The remaining robbers stole an iron box, took it away, and fled in the original car. Afterwards, the bank reported that the box contained 1,052 taels of silver and 9600 yuan, all of which were lost. They reported to the police station and requested investigation. It has been five years since then, and the robbers in this case have not been completely arrested and punished according to the law. It was not until last month that Liu Junqing, the deputy detective of the Laozha Police Station, learned that the robber Niu Ziping (also known as Niu Anhe) from Anhui Province was hiding in Meitan Street, Nanjing. He immediately rushed there and requested the assistance of the local military police to arrest Niu and bring him to Shanghai for interrogation. According to the investigation, Niu Anhe is the younger brother of Anru. Anru was previously suspected of being involved in the assassination of former Finance Minister Song and was arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. However, he escaped from prison. In addition to being involved in the robbery of a huge sum of money from the British Bank, Anhe also gathered a group in Sanyuanfang, Yangshupu Road on August 22, 1928, to beat Gu Bao from Guangdong Province to death and injure Wu Biao. One of the accomplices in the case, Dai Feiyun, was arrested and sentenced to imprisonment. Currently, Ru Baoyi, a lawyer from the Municipal Council Legal Group, has filed a lawsuit against Niu based on the investigation, requesting that he be punished for robbery and intentional injury causing death. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District District Court, and presiding judge Feng Shide interrogated him. First, lawyer Ru stated the case, and then Fei Zhenyong, the accountant of the British Bank, testified about the robbery that day. When questioned, the defendant also confessed. Judge Feng then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>The kidnappers Gao Changsheng and Ma Qiaosheng, etc., colluded to kidnap the rice merchant He Jiechun in January 1931, extorted a large sum of money for their own use. He's relative Zhu Qirong, was found to be a wealthy businessman due to his negotiation of the ransom, so they planned to kidnap him as well. At the same time, they planned to kidnap Shen Mengyi, etc., and also robbed the jewelry of the prostitute Hong Juhua. They were notorious repeat offenders. They were arrested by the Concession police and sent to the First Special District Court, which sentenced them to death. After submitting the case to the Provincial Government for approval, they were executed by firing squad. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, a judge from the Special Court opened the court to verify the identities of the criminals. He then ordered the police to transfer the criminals to the execution ground of the First Prison in Caohejing. Wu, a prosecutor appointed by the Shanghai District Court, led police chief Chen Junfang, police officer Chen Xihui, and execution police officers Wang Jianqing and Zhu Zhiqi to the execution ground. According to Gao Changsheng's confession, he was 25 years old, from Zhenjiang, and used to drive a car. He requested that his mother be notified to collect his body. Ma Qiaosheng confessed that his other name was Qiaosheng, he was 30 years old, from Wuxi, and used to be a servant. He asked that his wife be notified to collect his body. There were no other last words. The official ordered the execution by firing squad. The bodies were collected and sealed, and the family members collected them.</p>

She earned a considerable monthly salary. Unexpectedly, she was suddenly dismissed from the factory a few days ago. The factory manager suddenly dismissed her a few days ago. She went to the factory at about 6:00 p.m. to calculate her wages and ask for a bonus. Unexpectedly, Nagata Yoneichi, the Japanese foreman of the factory, behaved aggressively and unreasonably. He punched her several times and then snatched a sharp steel fork from the machine and stabbed her twice in the back of the head. She fell to the ground in extreme pain, bleeding profusely. The Japanese man then ordered a worker to drag her out of the factory and abandon her on the wasteland along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. After a while, she regained consciousness slightly and shouted for help. A passerby saw her and reported her to Yuan Shugui, the guard police of the Sixth District, Kaixuan Road.

<p>At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, a bizarre and tortuous case of massive fraud occurred at Kuangjia Company, Hejia Lane, Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen. The fraudster was a young man who claimed to have returned from studying in Belgium. The founder of Penglai Nanchang, Xiaoximen, Kuang Zhongmou, is usually very enthusiastic about local affairs and the national goods movement. Early in his life, he invested more than 300,000 yuan in his hometown of Yangshuyuan, Wuxi, to found Kuangcun Middle School, cultivating talents and sending excellent students to study abroad. He is highly respected by the community. A month ago, a young man in a Western suit came to Kuang's residence in Hejia Lane with a card to ask for an audience. Kuang received him. The young man claimed that his name was Kuang Bin, that he was 21 years old, and that he was from the same hometown and clan as Kuang. He had studied at Kuangcun Middle School since he was a child and had just now</p>
<h3 id="e152">Returned from Studying in Belgium <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Because of the friendship between relatives, he came to pay a special visit while passing through Shanghai. Kuang listened to him and thought that there was no Kuang Bin in his clan. However, he was dressed neatly, spoke elegantly, and talked about the history of his hometown, which was as detailed as a treasure. Therefore, he deeply believed him and treated him with courtesy. According to the young man, he would go to Nanjing to seek a job in a few days. Kuang appreciated that he was a promising young man. The young man then left. A few days later, the young man suddenly visited Kuang a second time. He said that he had filled out an appointment with the Nanjing Executive Yuan, and he was assigned to</p>
<h3 id="e153">Serve in Sichuan <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>He had to go to Nanjing that night to discuss everything. However, he still lacked travel expenses, so he planned to borrow some money. After saying that, he took out an appointment letter from the Executive Yuan from his side as proof. Kuang believed that he was telling the truth, so he generously borrowed 50 yuan as a favor to his clan to help him succeed. The young man thanked him and left. Unexpectedly, a few days later, the young man suddenly arrived uninvited again. He said that he had met with the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing,</p>
<h3 id="e154">Mr. Chu Minyi <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>He was instructed by Secretary-General Chu to go to Yunnan to carry out mass education work. Therefore, his job in Sichuan had been terminated. However, Yunnan was too far away, and the round-trip travel expenses were too high. He planned to borrow another 750 yuan from Kuang so that he could succeed. At that time, Kuang was suspicious of the contradictions in his words and deeds. At the same time, he investigated the Kuang surname in his hometown of Wuxi and found that there was no such person. He also felt that his behavior was strange, so he politely refused. The young man then showed</p>
<h3 id="e155">Disappointment <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>and left in disappointment. Afterwards, the young man came to visit Kuang several times, but Kuang did not receive him. Later, Kuang went to the YMCA in Baxianqiao for business and happened to meet the young man on the roadside. But he was already ragged, not the rich state he had been in. Kuang pitied his poor life and gave him another ten yuan, telling him to make a living. Since then, he has not met the young man. Recently, a few days ago, Kuang Zhongmou left Shanghai and returned to his hometown for important business. Unexpectedly, the young man found out and came up with a whimsical idea and cleverly executed a trick. First of all, at Kuangjia Company in Hejia Lane (1st), Xiaoximen, at about 2:00 p.m. on the first day, a</p>
<h3 id="e156">Strange Phone Call <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>was received, which said it was a long-distance call from Wuxi. The caller claimed to be Kuang Zhongmou himself, saying that he had met Kuang Bin in Wuxi. Because he wanted to study in Belgium again for further studies, Qian Sunqing (Chairman of Wuxi Chamber of Commerce) and Qian Jibo (Principal of Kuangcun Middle School) had guaranteed and sponsored Kuang Bin's tuition fee of 2,500 yuan. The IOU has now been written in my place. Kuang Bin has already taken a car to Shanghai today. After he sends the receipt, please pay the money. At that time, the Kuangjia Company staff received the phone call and the tone of voice was inconsistent, which was quite suspicious. Until yesterday (2nd) at 10:00 a.m., the young man indeed came to Kuangjia Company to ask for payment. The company staff asked him what evidence he had. He then took out</p>
<h3 id="e157">a Piece of Paper <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>stamped with Kuang Qiyong's seal (Kuang's alias), roughly saying that Yu had gone to the Jiangsu Construction Department with Qian Sunqing and others to discuss the Wuxi-Shanghai highway, and it would be five or six days before he could return to Shanghai. Kuang Bin borrowed 2,500 yuan, please pay it immediately, etc. However, the company staff observed that the handwriting on the note was clumsy and completely inconsistent, and the seal was also forged. They knew that he was pretending to be someone else to cheat, so they asked him about his words. At this point, the young man realized that</p>
<h3 id="e158">his Conspiracy was Exposed <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>His face turned red and he stammered, intending to escape. The company staff detained him and reported him to the Second Precinct of the Second District of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The head of the Second Precinct of the Second District thought that the young man's forgery of documents and impersonation was hateful. He also found out that all the appointment orders from the Executive Yuan that the young man had were also forged. He was deeply afraid that there might be other criminal facts, so he will send him to the General Bureau this morning for disposition.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Pudong Bloodshed: Thugs Kill Mother and Daughter; Dying Wife of Hu Cries Out, "Number Ten Killed Me!" Neighbor Yu Lianshan Detained as Suspect <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of three thugs who suddenly arrived at the home of Hu Changming, a resident of Maoye Lane, Lujia Residence, Pudong, around 10 p.m. the night before last, first robbing and then killing Hu's daughter with a key and injuring Hu's wife, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper, we have learned that Hu's wife, Yu, has also died from her serious injuries. Further details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Fire After Robbery: The night before last, when the thugs broke into Hu's house, Hu was already sound asleep. Hu's wife, Yu, was sitting in the room chatting with her niece, Chen Yu, leaving only Hu's daughter, Xiuzhen, doing chores outside the room. The thugs immediately tied her hands and feet with rope and snatched a gold-plated ring from her hand before shooting her dead. Then, they rushed into the room and took a gold-plated ring from Hu's wife and four gold-plated rings and a gold-plated bracelet from Chen Yu's hand. They also found 200 yuan in silver notes hidden away. At that moment, Hu's wife was also shot and fell to the ground. Hu had already been awakened and, seeing the criminals with weapons, dared not get out of bed to resist. Only after the criminals fled did he and his niece come out of the room, only to see his beloved daughter lying in a pool of blood. Although Hu's wife was unconscious at this time, she still had a faint breath, so he ordered people to take her to the Pudong Hospital. The hospital, seeing the severity of her injuries, urgently administered a life-saving injection. She gradually regained consciousness and cried out, "Number Ten killed me!" She repeated this twice before fainting again. She was then sent to the Shanghai Hospital in the Nanshi district for treatment.</p>
<p>Bodies of Mother and Daughter Inspected: Yesterday morning, Xie Along, the head of the 24th district, filed a report with the local court requesting an inspection of the body of Hu's daughter. Unexpectedly, Hu's wife also died in the hospital at 10 a.m. due to her serious injuries. Hu sent someone to carry the body back to his home in Pudong. In the afternoon, the court appointed Prosecutor Wu to cross the Huangpu River to Pudong and inspect the bodies of the mother and daughter. The onlookers were deeply saddened. The judge determined that the deceased had both died from gunshot wounds. Just as he was about to return, Hu suddenly rushed to the judge, knelt down, and kowtowed several times, loudly proclaiming his grievance. Prosecutor Wu ordered Hu to first prepare coffins and place the two bodies separately, and then report to the court for questioning tomorrow (i.e., today).</p>
<p>Neighbor Yu Lianshan Detained: When this case occurred, Chief Zhang of the Third District initially suspected it was a robbery. However, after hearing that Hu's wife had cried out before her death that "Number Ten" had killed her, he believed there might be a clue to follow. According to the victim Hu Changming, "The 'Number Ten' my wife mentioned, I suspect, is a certain person who used to be a patrolman with the number ten. This person now works elsewhere. Previously, Yu Lianshan, my neighbor from Qingjiang across the street, had asked me to betroth my daughter to this patrolman, but I refused. Now that I am old and have no son, I have hired a matchmaker to find a son-in-law. It is possible that this patrolman holds a grudge and committed this act." He also said, "When I held a banquet, Yu Lianshan also came to eat and complained at the table. After the incident, Yu behaved suspiciously. In reality, Yu and the murderer are likely colluding. I request his detention for investigation." The District Chief found Hu's statements to be quite reasonable and immediately detained Yu Lianshan for strict interrogation. However, Yu insisted that he had not conspired to commit murder. The District Chief ordered him to be detained in the district pending the arrest of the "Number Ten" patrolman he mentioned, after which further questioning would be conducted.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council International Volunteer Corps, after its annual inspection by Brigadier-General F.B. Messervy, has had his report submitted to the SMC Defence Committee for consideration. The report stated that there were too few officers assisting in the corps and proposed adding a chief of staff. The corps commander submitted a plan, which was approved by the committee and submitted to the council for approval and implementation. The corps commander also stated that the number of corps members was insufficient, which was concerning in case of emergency. He proposed that the council explain this to various firms, especially British and American firms, and encourage their employees to join as corps members. The council decided to appoint a committee to promote this initiative.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Ministry of Finance Issues Notice Strictly Prohibiting the Private Production of Counterfeit Cigarettes and Tax Evasion <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a notice yesterday, stating: "For the strict enforcement of prohibitions and earnest admonishments, it has been observed that handmade cigarettes often counterfeit the trademarks of various Chinese and foreign companies, selling them privately and evading taxes. This not only encroaches on the market for machine-made cigarettes and harms the business of legitimate tobacco merchants but also results in significant losses to the national tax revenue. According to laws and tax regulations, this is strictly prohibited. Considering the livelihood of the poor, it was not deemed appropriate to prohibit it outright. Instead, inspections and investigations were ordered, with penalties imposed for cases of violation. The Taxation Administration was also instructed to separately formulate single-item measures for the taxation of handmade cigarettes, which have been reviewed, approved, and promulgated. The tax rate is specially reduced compared to machine-made cigarettes, which is considered compassionate. However, recent investigations have revealed that many handmade cigarette producers are still privately producing counterfeit cigarettes and selling them in the market. In particular, the area near the tobacco-producing regions of southern Henan and northern Anhui is flooded with illegal cigarettes, which is blatantly audacious. Even in Ningbo in Zhejiang and Liuhe in Jiangsu, there have been repeated seizures in recent days. This has led to widespread emulation, and the situation is worsening. It has also been heard that local people's organizations are even engaging in private protection. Such pursuit of profit is blinding, and the disregard for laws and regulations is deeply regrettable. The complete prohibition of handmade cigarettes, strict investigation, search, and arrest should have been immediately implemented to rectify the situation and purify the tax administration. However, in consideration of the livelihood of the people, it is unbearable to punish without educating. In addition to notifying the provincial governments and ordering the relevant local county governments to work with the unified tax agencies and local military police to conduct secret investigations, strictly investigate, and punish private cigarette production, this strict prohibition is further clarified. All local cigarette producers, merchants, and people should be aware of this. You must know that counterfeiting cigarette trademarks, privately producing, and evading taxes is not only a violation of tax regulations but also a criminal offense. Once caught, you will be severely punished and sentenced according to the law. You must wake up from your past mistakes, follow the correct path, either pay taxes according to regulations, or switch to another occupation. Do not privately produce counterfeits and violate the prohibitions. All local people's organizations should especially uphold public duty, abide by the law, and not engage in private protection or self-indulgence. After this admonishment, if the aforementioned violations are found again, it will be deemed persistent and unrepentant. In order to protect customs duties and prevent private evasion, the Ministry will definitely consult and dispatch troops to strictly arrest, prosecute, and punish according to the law. Those local bullies who use local organizations as a pretext for protection will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished if the facts are verified. No leniency will be shown. Be cautious and heedful. This notice is hereby issued."</p>

<p>The fourth Chrysanthemum Exhibition in this city, organized by the Social Bureau, has been actively underway since the second preparatory meeting on October 30th. The main venue has been selected as the hall on the third floor of the China National Goods Company and has begun to be arranged. Wang Yiting, Xie Gongzhan, Cai Wuji, Xu Haifan, Fang Xuanqing, Tong Wangmin, Yang Shouren, Geng Shun'en, Wu Juenong, and Huang Yueyuan have been hired as review committee members. During the exhibition, it is planned to invite chrysanthemum painting expert Mr. Xie Gongzhan to display his masterpieces from previous years. His talented student, Yao Yunqi, also has many outstanding works, each labeled with the name of the chrysanthemum. At that time, the chrysanthemums and chrysanthemum paintings will complement each other, greatly enriching the historical significance. It is also learned that the late-flowering chrysanthemums at Donggou Forestry Farm have gradually opened, with reds, purples, and various colors. To provide for fellow enthusiasts, they are being sold at low prices at any time. Those with Yuanming's penchant for chrysanthemums and appreciating the elegant scenery of the farm, which is naturally beautiful, are eager to visit the scenic spot while the chrysanthemums are in full bloom to enjoy the chrysanthemums. Those who have gone in recent days are like those on the Shanyin Road. On Sundays, Xu Yuanfang, Mo Heng, Tan Boying, Zhang Zhenhou, Zhang Yingchao, Cao Renzhe, Shen Shouchang, Zhou Chengze, Bao Yu, and other celebrities, dozens of people, have gone to the farm one after another and were received by the farm manager Bao Bodu for a day of sightseeing and chrysanthemum appreciation. In addition, they all left inscriptions to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Recent News from the Hagenbeck Circus: Lions, Tigers, and Bears Combined in One Act <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Since the German Hagenbeck Circus changed its new program the day before yesterday, the most praised by the audience is the amazing beast scene directed by Mr. Kersten, combining lions, tigers, and black bears in one act. Mr. Kersten is the first person to direct this kind of mixed performance. He can tame African lions and command them as he wishes, which is amazing. He and Mr. Marschall, the tiger trainer who is calm and composed, are equally impressive. His limbs are covered with scars from lion and tiger claws, which shows that today's success is not easy. Other programs, such as the equestrian skills of beautiful women riding two horses each, the Roman equestrian skills of ancient times, the aerial dances of three brothers, all kinds of amazing performances on high poles, and the springboard show of six brothers, are all wonderful and moving, winning a lot of applause.</p>
<p>Mr. Schweid, the general manager of the circus, announced that more than 50 carnivores will be fed at 11 a.m. on Sunday. Previously, carnivores were not fed on Sundays. From now on, the day will be changed to Monday. Therefore, the feeding spectacle this Sunday (i.e., the 5th) is the first time the menagerie has been open after the troupe arrived in Shanghai. The menagerie will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission tickets are 50 cents for adults and 20 cents for children.</p>

<p>The strike of dock workers at Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s wharves in Shantou and Xiamen has subsided invisibly. In recent days, due to rumors of strikes, passenger and cargo ships that had been stopped in Shanghai for several days have been reporting to Jardine's China Navigation Company vessels for loading, resulting in a large accumulation of export goods in front of the company's wharf, which are being loaded onto ships day and night. Today, the Yingzhou ship to Shantou and Xiamen is loaded with 15,500 bags of grain, more than 5,000 pieces of bean cake and bran, 600-700 pieces of piece goods and cotton yarn, and many other miscellaneous goods. Those who reported later were unable to be accommodated due to insufficient space and returned their goods one after another. Therefore, the next shift of ships will transport them. As for the goods going to Guangzhou, they are not being loaded at the moment but are being divided among the Ewo and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships to Guangdong.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Dyeing Workers Refuse to Discuss Liquor Subsidy with the Silk Industry Reform Committee; New Standards Will Be Established for Valuation <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Silk and Satin Dyeing Trade Association Reform Committee of this city has been unable to resolve the dispute over the opposition of the Silk and Satin Cloth Office to disrupting the liquor subsidy agreement and the demand to separate the liquor subsidy and the work stoppage for ten days. The Reform Committee replied to the silk industry's request to separate and restore dyeing prices, but the silk industry seems unable to accept the Liu Kai issue. If dyeing prices are restored, the agreement can be fulfilled. Yesterday, the Reform Committee sent another letter to the silk industry. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Responding to your letter of the 2nd of this month, we have learned everything. Our association has experienced a work stoppage due to the labor's request to separate the liquor subsidy. This liquor subsidy is included in the dyeing price agreement and is part of the dyeing price paid by your industry. Whether it is mixed or separated, it seems to have an impact on the basis of the dyeing price agreement. The labor's request for separation is purely to maintain the economic independence of the workers and to prevent future disputes between labor and management. Their attitude is firm. Your association's response regarding the separation of the liquor subsidy is that it is difficult to change due to the restrictions of laws and contracts and that there is no room for maneuvering. In order to avoid further escalation of the situation, our association has again sought solutions from the labor. Regarding the dyeing price agreement signed by the Municipal Government Bureau of Agriculture and Commerce sixteen years ago and the new product crepe price regulations continued in the nineteenth year, we request that your association strictly order your members to abide by them and fulfill the agreement. Now, there are also newly invented Hua Jin crepe and various crepe products with long lengths that urgently require new prices to match the cost. Some silk companies deduct dyeing prices, and dyeing shops violate contracts and disrupt prices. Both sides should earnestly correct these issues to maintain business. Our association has decided to send representatives to your office at 2 p.m. on the 5th of this month to learn and discuss the dyeing prices of the aforementioned new products and long crepe, and we request that your association appoint a responsible representative to negotiate and establish standards for price settlement. Our association will have a basis to actively resolve the issue with the labor and resume work as soon as possible to quell the dispute. We hope for your reply."</p>

<h3 id="e168">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Develop Maritime Transport; Sanbei Line to Add North and South Ocean Routes <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's undertaking of the water-land combined transport of state-owned railways has caused opposition from all private shipping companies, who have requested the central government to allow them to participate as well. Amidst this intense dispute, the Sanbei Steam Navigation Company has plans to operate North and South Ocean routes and add new ocean liners to develop domestic transport. After many days of discussion, these plans are about to be realized. The latest news is divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e169">Inaugurating Qingdao Route <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, Sanbei Steam Navigation Company has rapidly increased its number of ships and expanded its tonnage. However, its shipping business has always focused entirely on the Yangtze River. Therefore, the number of voyages and ships traveling up and down the Yangtze River is even greater than that of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In terms of coastal shipping, there is no dedicated route yet. Now that the company has purchased the Jingan ship from the Ministry of Navy, which has excellent passenger accommodations and can also transport goods, it is undergoing major repairs. The company's owner, Yu Qiaqing, believes that the number of passengers traveling between Shanghai and Qingdao is increasing daily, and the exchange of goods is also very crowded, mostly transported by foreign shipping lines, which is a pity as profits are flowing overseas. Also, Qingdao has a public wharf where ships can dock, eliminating the need to purchase and build one. Therefore, it is more convenient to open a route. After discussions, it was decided to implement it. Once the Jingan leaves the dock, it will immediately travel this route. This ship will run on a regular schedule to provide transportation for passengers between Shanghai and Qingdao.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Adding South China Ships <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The company has a large number of ships and a surplus of tonnage. The larger ocean liners, such as Mingshan, Taishan, and Longyi, are all leased out. Since the boycott of Jardine Matheson in Guangdong on the South China route, the Ewo and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's South Seas liners have been doing very well, with each voyage fully loaded. In the spring of this year, the company had already trialed a voyage to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong, which was handled by Mr. Chen Shuntong of Zhongwei Company with excellent results. It has long been planned to formally dispatch ships, but it has been delayed until today due to lack of preparation. At the moment, the various merchants in South China are in need of tonnage. Sanbei Company has repeatedly contacted various passenger companies and believes that the time is ripe. It has decided to add a new route from Shanghai to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong. Before the wharves and warehouses in each port have been added, passengers and cargo will temporarily be loaded and unloaded alongside the ships. The ships to be dispatched are currently being discussed and allocated. Once they are assigned, the regular schedule will be officially launched. This is also a good sign for the Chinese shipping industry.</p>
<h3 id="e171">All Navigators of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Oppose Income Tax <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Since August, all central government officials have been required to pay income tax, with rates ranging from 1% on incomes above 50 yuan to 8% on incomes above 700 yuan. The higher the salary, the higher the tax. This income tax is used to fund party expenses. Customs and postal workers are also required to pay it. As the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-run organization, its crew members are also required to pay it. The engineers have already petitioned for its cancellation to express their opposition. Now, all the ship captains, chief mates, and second mates of the Navigation Department have also submitted a petition to the general manager opposing the payment of income tax. The petition argues that the navigators of each ship are merely in a labor-capital relationship and do not have the qualifications of government officials or are not central government employees. According to the income tax regulations, crew members should not pay it. It also cites that although customs and postal workers belong to state-run organizations, their treatment is different from that of crew members, and there is no reason for them to pay income tax. It requests that it be immediately abolished and that the deducted amounts be returned in full. This petition was forwarded to the company by the Navigators' Association yesterday.</p>

(3) Regarding the case of the Zhonghui Bank's request to join as a member, it was resolved to pass it. The remaining cases were brief. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Large groups of people often parade in the Public Settlement, which obstructs traffic and transportation.

<p>The Shanghai Second Branch Court submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice to finalize a site of 162 mu in the Puson District for the construction of a new prison and submitted an estimated cost of 63,200 yuan for land acquisition and various miscellaneous expenses to the Ministry. It specifically requested an additional provisional estimate for the 12th year. The Central Political Council resolved that the provisional expenses are for the purchase of the new prison site, which is important for the recovery of concession legal rights. It should be approved as usual and has been forwarded by the National Government to the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics for compliance.</p>

<p>Director Wang of the Yuehan Railway Came to Visit in Person</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huningyong Railway Offices, located at No. 40 Jingansi Road (near Huoluk), telephone 35815, have been open for two months and business has progressed rapidly. Recently, the office released its October business report, with revenue reaching nearly 20,000 yuan, a double increase compared to September. Vice Director Wang Renkang of the Yuehan Railway made a special trip to the office to see how the business office of this road was being replicated and was personally taken on a tour. Various foreign travel groups also competed to entrust the office to handle matters on their behalf. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e176">Sharp Increase in Business Revenue <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The office released its October business performance yesterday, with total revenue reaching over 18,000 yuan, including 16,461.03 yuan in passenger tickets sold, 3,428 inquiries answered, 924 pieces of luggage handled, 292.95 yuan in revenue, 3 hotel reservations made, 13.60 yuan in commission and foreign currency reservations, 347 sleeper reservations made, 473 parcels handled, 1,225.55 yuan in revenue, and a total revenue of 17,993.13 yuan, an increase of over 6,700 yuan compared to the previous month.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the office, the performance has been excellent, and various roads have planned to replicate it. Representatives from Beinning, Hangjiang, Xiang'e, Jinpu, Pinghan, Jiaoji and other roads have come to Shanghai to visit. Recently, Vice Director Wang Renkang of the Yuehan Railway, who had also been ordered to replicate it, made a special trip to the office to visit and was received by the office and provided with detailed explanations. It is reported that the road plans to open an office in Guangzhou first to provide services.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Hosting Group Travel <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Hosting group travel is also one of the office's important businesses. Recently, 70 members of the Shanghai American Women's Association went to Suzhou for sightseeing, and more than 10 members of the European Buddhist group, including Zhao Kong, went to Qixia Mountain to receive vows. All of their car procedures were handled by the office, and staff were sent to take care of them in the car, which was very satisfactory. The World Tour group coming to Shanghai in the near future to visit Hangzhou has also entrusted the office to handle the arrangements in advance.</p>

<p>At 8:45 p.m. last night, a fire broke out suddenly at Zhou Wanxing Nian Gao Shop, No. 413 Zhaozhou Road, Tangjiawan, Nanshi. In an instant, the flames spread and extended to five stores, including Ziyun Xiang Dried Bean Curd Shop at No. 411, Wang Tongchun Porridge Shop at No. 409, Kang Hou Wine Shop at No. 407, and Chunxing Hot Water Stall at No. 405. The upper floors of Nos. 413, 411, and 409 were completely destroyed, and the losses were heavier. In addition to the Chinese fire trucks that should have arrived, the French Concession Fire Brigade also drove to assist in the rescue because the road across the street from that location belonged to the French Concession Avenue Rawie. The cause of the fire is unknown. The arsonist has fled in fear of punishment. The Second District General Office is currently dispatching personnel to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Municipal Council Did Not Approve Dance Halls Extending Hours <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Six dance halls in the Public Settlement, represented by Price Waterhouse &amp; Co., accountants, petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council to extend the restriction on business hours from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. This proposal was discussed by the Defence Committee, which deemed it inappropriate to approve. The Board of Directors reported it on the 1st of this month, and the Board of Directors rejected it. The regulations for closing doors at 2 a.m. will be strictly enforced. Prior to 1930, the regulations stipulated that these entertainment venues should close at 2 a.m., but those who paid a special fee could extend the hours to all night. In 1929, there was a strong opposition to this all-night arrangement. As a result, the Municipal Council decided to limit the hours to 2 a.m., with no exceptions except for National Day and public holidays. Later, after petitions from the owners of each venue, it was permitted to extend the hours to 4 a.m. on Saturday nights, but a special fee had to be paid. This arrangement has been implemented in consultation with the French Concession for three and a half years. According to the Commissioner of Police, there are no new reasons for this request to extend the hours. The regulations do not need to be changed. The chairman of the Defence Committee expressed his deep regret that some people stay in entertainment venues until late at night, which seriously damages their personal finances and abilities.</p>

<p>The famous painter Gao Qifeng came to Shanghai a few days ago to prepare for the Berlin Painting Exhibition, intending to be a representative to Germany. Unexpectedly, he caught a cold on the way, which triggered an old illness. He died at 3 p.m. on the 2nd of this month at the Dahua Hospital in this city. Mr. Gao worked hard for the revolution and had a very glorious history, but he did not dwell on his achievements and devoted himself to art. His works have been exhibited many times at domestic and foreign art exhibitions and have won praise in the art world. At the Paris art exhibition opened by Xu Beihong, twelve of the works displayed were purchased by the French government, and Mr. Gao's work was one of them. His sudden death is a great loss to our country's artists.</p>

<p>Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Wu Zhihao, along with other enthusiastic proponents of national goods, recently initiated the China National Goods Production and Sales United Company. They sought to galvanize various provinces into a national salvation effort through increased production. Although only a few days have passed since the announcement inviting investment, the response from various provinces has been overwhelming. As of yesterday, numerous enthusiastic officials and patriotic individuals from provinces including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Shandong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Suiyuan have joined the company as initiators or sponsors. Chairman Shao of the Shaanxi Provincial Government and Mr. Wu Jiantao of the Jiangxi Provincial Government sent express letters and telegrams to the company, acknowledging their participation as initiators. The letter from Chairman Shao is recorded below:</p>
<p>"To whom it may concern, upon receiving your letter, I have learned that you are initiating the establishment of the China National Goods Production and Sales United Company, to concentrate the strength of national goods businesses and various sectors nationwide, adhering to the principle of economic salvation through industrial development. This matter concerns the development of national goods production and sales, and I will strive to assist. I hereby agree to participate. I respectfully reply to your letter and wish you well."</p>

<p>Chen Qiulin, a native of Pudong, aged 35, working as a waiter at the Shenhe Restaurant opposite Little World in the city, cohabited with a woman surnamed Shen from Tongzhou Province, aged 30, residing at No. 7 Old School Yard. He routinely engaged in the private sale of opium for smoking and colluded with hooligans to lure and sell women, profiting from the illicit gains. However, the scheme was discovered by Liu Yanfang, the chief of the first district, second precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He immediately dispatched detectives Ren Shouzhi and patrol officer Zhang Panchi, along with police chief Li Fuyi and officers, who secretly went to the address around 8 PM last night. At that time, Chen Shen, the cohabitant, and Chen Qiulin were arguing and ingesting raw opium. While rescuing them, thirteen people, including smokers and men and women chatting at Chen's house, were apprehended. Upon interrogation, they all spoke evasively. Opium lamps, pipes, and red documents were found during the search. The list of names taken to the precinct is as follows: (1) Chen Qiulin (35 years old), from Pudong; (2) Chen Qiuhe (30 years old), from Pudong; (3) Chen Shen (32 years old), from Tongzhou; (4) Chen Xiaomei (16 years old), from Jingjiang; (5) Wang Zhoushi (29 years old), from Wuxi; (6) Lu Xushi (28 years old), from Taicang; (7) Huang Hongsheng (37 years old), from Pudong; (8) Yu Kaosheng (35 years old), from Sajing; (9) Gu Jinsheng (42 years old), from Pudong; (10) Jiang Aren (38 years old), from Pudong; (11) Cai Shaoji (33 years old), from Wuxi; (12) Pan Xushi (37 years old), from Pudong; (13) Huang Geng (21 years old), from Pudong. After interrogation by Chief Liu, Chen Xiaomei (16 years old), from Jingjiang, confessed that when she was eleven years old, she was betrothed to Tong Fugen from Wuxi as a child bride. However, her fiancé died of illness in the first lunar month of this year, and she was severely beaten by her grandmother. In March, she was brought to Shanghai from Wuxi and instructed to work at the Xin Shen Cotton Mill in Caojiadu. Her grandmother left, and later, Wang Zhoushi, who was also apprehended, used sweet words to deceive her and lure her to No. 18 Baoxing Lane, Dongxin Bridge, French Concession, where she stayed for three nights. She was matched with an unfamiliar 21-year-old man. He said he was doing business on a boat. They agreed on a betrothal gift of over 100 silver dollars. Today, they were taken to Chen Qiulin's house to pay the money and hand over the person, to be married the day after tomorrow, when they were arrested during a fight. Wang Zhoushi (29 years old), from Wuxi, only admitted to taking Chen Xiaomei to Little World to play. The rest of her testimony was cunning. The other people claimed they were visiting friends, and so on. Chief Liu, considering the case involved luring women for sale and operating an opium den in violation of the law, ordered the thirteen male and female criminals, along with the evidence, to be handed over to the Headquarters for legal proceedings yesterday.</p>

<p>Head Charred and Face Disfigured – A Gruesome Sight</p>
<p>The Xie Xing Jade Workshop at No. 148 Anren Street, inside the New North Gate, caught fire carelessly around 5:00 PM on the 30th of last month. Fire brigades from various districts responded and extinguished the blaze, which destroyed more than twenty buildings housing over forty families. A daughter of Wang Zhao from No. 214 Yuyuan Road, named Amao, died from injuries sustained after jumping from the building. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Chen Ziming, a 36-year-old from Suzhou who runs a leather suitcase business in Bengbu, his wife Wang, and their two daughters and one son lived at the Xie Xing Jade Workshop on the fourth floor. The eldest daughter was Jinmei, aged 14, the second daughter was Kunbao, aged 12, and the youngest was a son named Arong, who was just four years old. On the 23rd of last month, Wang went to her hometown on important business, leaving only Jinmei and the other two children to watch over the house. When the fire broke out, the flames were intense on the lower floors, burning through the staircase. The flames spread to the upper floor, filling the room with red heat. Jinmei and the others were terrified. Jinmei immediately climbed to the roof, but her younger brother Arong was too young and weak to climb. Therefore, his second sister, Kunbao, disregarded her own safety and picked up her brother, intending to carry him to the roof. However, Kunbao was a young girl and did not have the strength to do so. Moreover, her head and lips had been burned by the fire and she was in unbearable pain. She had no choice but to abandon her younger brother to the flames. Jinmei then climbed onto the roof and shouted for help. Members of the various fire brigades spotted her and immediately devised a way to climb to the roof and rescue the two girls. Kunbao was rushed to the hospital for treatment. Her injuries were minor, so after the hospital applied medication and bandages, she was discharged. Chief Liu from the First District, Second Precinct brought the two girls to the precinct for questioning. It was then learned that Arong had died in the fire. Officers were dispatched to search through the rubble around the fire scene. Around 7:00 PM in the evening, the child's body was finally found, but it was charred beyond recognition, with a ruptured abdomen and protruding intestines. Considering the matter involved loss of life, the local authorities were ordered to report to the Shanghai District Court for an autopsy yesterday. In the meantime, his family was notified to come to Shanghai to enshroud the child's body.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Dissenting Views on "New Discourse on Teachers" <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xia</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Zhecun has raised objections to my work, "New Discourse on Teachers," which seems to aim at dispelling heresies and rectifying people's minds. Do I enjoy arguing? No, I am compelled to do so! I also have objections to his objections.</p>
<p>First, I said, "Teachers are certainly not entirely worthy of respect," to make it clear that there are aspects of teachers that are worthy of respect. I also said, "Teachers are not necessarily valuable," implying that there may be aspects of teachers that are valuable. Moreover, this rationale is based on the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. Mr. Shi, an advocate of reading the Analects, should find this gratifying, and might even smile and say, "Virtue is never solitary; it is sure to have neighbors!" As for Mr. Shi saying that my article "explains in the first paragraph that teachers originally have no qualities worthy of respect," it seems that Mr. Shi got confused from reading literary selections. In fact, my intention was merely to say that teachers have aspects that are worthy of respect and aspects that are not worthy of respect, hence the statement "Teachers are certainly not entirely worthy of respect."</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Shi said, "We can dismiss university professors because of differences in thought and doctrine, but we can never deny the mentors of primary and secondary schools because of our own increased learning." This is the key point of Mr. Shi's article. My article does not seem to touch upon this point, so it would not be necessary to respond. Even if discussing Meng Ke's debate about teachers and students, as Mr. Shi said, "speaking for Mr. Wei," the school where Mr. Wei lived clearly had the word "special" on its sign, and the teachers in the school should be "masters" and "professors." Perhaps the reason he wanted to criticize a certain society's art exhibition was, as Mr. Shi said, "We can dismiss university professors because of differences in thought and doctrine." (If this is the case, Mr. Wei should thank Mr. Shi for offering an explanation for dismissing his teacher.) Perhaps Mr. Wei had read the Analects and believed that "the foundation of moral cultivation" is good, following the sage's teaching of "not yielding to one's teacher in the pursuit of benevolence," which is also possible.</p>
<p>Third, Mr. Shi, being honored as a "remnant of the Qing dynasty" and a "young rascal from the foreign concessions," humbly declined and could not avoid writing a lengthy article to defend himself. Who does not want to be good? I also sympathize. Now Mr. Shi wants to respectfully give Mr. Wei Mengke the title of "frivolous." Even if Mr. Wei is unwilling to come out and defend himself, what you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others. Confucius' consistent life philosophy is about loyalty and forgiveness. Mr. Shi must have read the Analects, as it is "the foundation of moral cultivation." I wonder what his thoughts are? Otherwise, I highly suspect that even if someone has read the Analects and solemnly advises others to read the Analects, their "moral cultivation" is still questionable.</p>
<p>Honestly, the main idea of my "New Discourse on Teachers" is entirely based on the old principles of Confucius, Mencius, and Han Yu. There is no "new knowledge" or "new thought" in it. The title "New" is deliberately used as a joke, and it is actually just a record and not a creation. Therefore, it will not lead to any serious "serious problem in society," unless the person who says this has ulterior motives.</p>

<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Summer, this is a fiery pit.</p>
<p>The bellows roar, and when Little Pockface's hands become weak, the fire in the furnace is red and hot again; the iron bars and iron blocks are placed in the fire, and after being burned for a while, they turn red.</p>
<p>Then: Tat-tat-tat丨the iron hammer strikes down.</p>
<p>The sparks are scorching.</p>
<p>"Ya Biao, be careful!"</p>
<p>Old Chan says to Ya Biao, who is raising the iron hammer. Ya Biao, whose face and body are all very dirty, is a newcomer. He clenches his teeth, panting: this work is really hard.</p>
<p>Now autumn is already deep. But Ya Biao and Little Pockface are both sweating.</p>
<p>Zhong Laoer is using a drill; it turns with a scratching sound, and silver-like iron filings fall on the ground.</p>
<p>It's all turbid smoke. It's so stuffy in the shop!</p>
<p>The board walls are black, the floor is black, and the bed boards where they sleep are also black. But when it gets dark, they are already so tired that they don't care about anything and fall down and snore.</p>
<p>On this day, it is raining outside. The weather is very cold. Early in the morning, Little Pockface is puffing and pulling the bellows: once the fire is lit, it immediately warms up. Old Chan hasn't gotten up yet: Ya Biao, rubbing his sleepy eyes, walks out. He looks at the many things that need to be done, and instinctively takes a breath.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Ya Biao?"</p>
<p>Little Pockface raises his voice and says.</p>
<p>Ya Biao stands by the stove fire:</p>
<p>"Damn it, I can't take it anymore!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Look here: I have to finish it today! Old Chan won't help, Little Pockface, I only have these two hands, right?"</p>
<p>He holds out his hands.</p>
<p>Then, he takes off a lined jacket, and the one underneath is torn. Little Pockface sees a lump of flesh bulging on his arm.</p>
<p>Iron blocks and iron bars are placed in the fire.</p>
<p>When they turn red: raise the iron hammer! Tat-tat-tat... sparks fly onto Little Pockface's body.</p>
<p>"Ya Biao, you're so strong!"</p>
<p>He shakes his newly shaved head.</p>
<p>There is no answer.</p>
<p>The rain is heavier in the afternoon. Water is surging in the low-lying areas of the road, and there are no pedestrians in the cold and quiet.</p>
<p>Ya Biao thinks: Why hasn't Zhong Laoer come yet? We're suffering so much, but he's sleeping with his wife...</p>
<p>After hammering, it is dipped into the water; with a "chī" sound, steam rises from the surface of the water. Ya Biao stops, relaxes, and wipes the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve.</p>
<p>Zhong Laoer comes in the rain.</p>
<p>"Laoer, you slept so comfortably!"</p>
<p>He says sourly.</p>
<p>Zhong Laoer pats him on the shoulder, smiling: "I'll help you today, Ya Biao, don't..."</p>
<p>"Damn it!"</p>
<p>They all laugh.</p>

<p>Why so pale and wan, fond lover?</p>
<p>Prithee, why so pale?</p>
<p>Will, when looking well can't move her,</p>
<p>Looking ill prevail?</p>
<p>Prithee, why so pale?</p>
<p>Why so dull and mute, young sinner?</p>
<p>Prithee, why so mute?</p>
<p>Will, when speaking well can't win her,</p>

<p>Prithee, why so mute?</p>
<p>Quit, quit for shame! this will not move,</p>

<p>If of herself she will not love,</p>
<p>Nothing can make her:</p>
<p>The devil take her!</p>

<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Zhecun suddenly had a whim, thinking that "Zhuangzi and Literary Selections" are "the foundation of literary cultivation." It seems that he doesn't need it himself, so he can only "recommend" it to others. After thinking about it, who should he "recommend" it to? Ah, I got it, "youth!" "Recommend" it to young college students? He's afraid of encountering Mr. Wu Shichang. "Recommend" it to young university professors? He's afraid of encountering Mr. Yu Pingbo. "Showing off an axe in front of Master Luban," it's just showing his ignorance! Mr. Shi thought again and said:</p>
<p>The youth I am referring to are those who can read Zhuangzi and Literary Selections, not just middle school students. If it is middle school students, then junior high school students are not qualified to talk about this, but a few senior high school students should be counted in.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Shi's words, there are not many young middle school students who must read Zhuangzi and Literary Selections. What kind of youth is Mr. Shi referring to when he says "youth who can read Zhuangzi and Literary Selections"? "Remnants of the Qing dynasty?" "Young rascals from the foreign concessions?" I am ashamed that I cannot get any "new knowledge" about "Zhuangzi and Literary Selections" from Mr. Shi's "breakthrough" article, so I also "doubt" the result of Mr. Shi's breakthrough!</p>

<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>丨Travel Notes 1丨</p>
<p>Debusha is not bad, we have passed through this place back and forth. The ground is full of sand, looking over it is a yellow expanse, connected to the hillsides at both ends. A series of footprints were left in the middle of the road. These traces are very deep. At the same time, many bamboo sieves were placed in the middle of the road, one after another, only a few steps apart. At first, I thought these were prepared for pedestrians to step on, so as to avoid people feeling strenuous when moving their steps on the sand. But later, when I got closer, I realized that these were also things used by monks for alms, and sure enough, someone threw some copper coins into them. It is indeed not easy to walk on the sand. When you put your foot down, it feels like you are sinking into the sand. When you lift your foot again, a lot of sand has already accumulated in your shoe. The sun is very hot, and the sand is steamed so hot that it is about to catch fire. Your feet cannot stay on it for a minute, otherwise the soles of your feet will be steamed. Here I had to take off my hemp shoes and walk barefoot, making a running posture, although it was strenuous, I finally walked through. An older friend admitted defeat and hired a sedan chair.</p>
<p>This time we did not go to visit Mount Foding. When we went back, we passed by Xianren Well, and took a ladle of cold water from the well to drink. The well is located in a ravine and is always cool. We each drank a few mouthfuls. The day before, we each drank a cup of well water at Meifu Dan Well. After leaving Xianren Well, we met two or three Taoist priests. They were chatting and walking up from the mountain. One person said: The scenery of Mount Putuo is best on Mount Foding. But we only knew it was too late. We just hadn't been to this place.</p>
<p>The next day, everyone prepared to leave early in the morning. The receptionist of the temple said that there was a ship leaving for Shanghai in the morning, and they would send us down the mountain before six o'clock, but there was no ship on the sea. We waited at the dock for an hour and there was still no movement. Next to the dock there is a small temple, and we went in to rest. This temple is very small, and there are often sedan chair carriers disturbing it. A monk who watched the temple was washing tinware in the hall, and he complained to us about his monotonous life. While we were talking, the sedan chair carriers were knocking on the door again, and when it was about to cause trouble, the monk took a wooden stick and went out.</p>
<p>We waited in this small temple until twelve o'clock, and the people from the temple brought us food. We didn't expect to have this meal. Not long after we finished eating, someone came in and said that the ship had arrived. We happily went out to look, only to realize that this was a ship from Shanghai. Friend T, who was going to Haimen, left with his mother and brothers. We asked others if there were any ships going to Shanghai, and they said that there would be one at seven or eight o'clock tomorrow morning. My friend and I cannot return to Shanghai. We had to stay in Putuo for another day. When we tiredly walked back to the temple, even the receptionist who had seen us off earlier was a little surprised. He might be happy, because the temple had earned five more dollars for nothing.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Two Brothers (17) <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>He got up and walked towards the end of the embankment again. He felt a little better, he was satisfied because he understood the reason for his irritability, glimpsed his own hidden feelings, and discovered another self.</p>
<p>"So I am jealous of Zhe An," he thought in his heart. "This is indeed quite despicable, this matter! I am now certain that my guess is correct, because when I heard the news that he had inherited the inheritance, the first thing I thought of was that he would marry Mrs. Lu Zuimi. But I don't like this rational fool, this annoying virtuous young woman. Then this is a jealousy without conditions, this is simply the essence of jealousy, this is jealousy for the sake of jealousy! This matter must be paid attention to!"</p>
<p>He walked to the signal post that indicated the height of the water inside the dock. He struck a match and shone it on the names of the ships that had already arrived outside the port and were waiting for the next high tide to enter. Among the ships about to enter the port were steamers from Brazil, Paratha, Chile, and Japan, two Danish brigantines, a Latvian clipper, and a Turkish steamer. When he saw the words "a Turkish steamer," he was as shocked as if he had seen a "Swedish steamer": he saw in a strange dream a large ship, carrying many people with turbans and wide-legged trousers climbing on those ropes.</p>
<p>"I'm thinking too stupidly," he thought; "the Turkish nation is originally a nation good at sailing."</p>
<p>He took a few more steps forward, then stopped and stared at the bay. On the right, above the Bay of Saint-Adresse, the two electric lighthouses of Cape Heffer, like two deformed, twin Cyclopes (giants with one eye in the forehead in mythology), cast their long and strong gazes on the sea. These two parallel lines emanating from two adjacent focal points, like the huge tails of two comets, descended from the top of the coast to the bottom of the horizon along a straight and boundless slope. Secondly, on the two embankments, there were two other lights, like the children of the two giants above, indicating the entrance to the port of Havre: and over there, on the other side of the Seine, we also saw other lights, many other lights, moving or still, bright or dark, like many eyes, sometimes open, sometimes closed, those yellow, red, and green eyes of various ports, staring at the dark sea covered with ships, the agile eyes of the hospitable continent, simply relying on the unchanging and regular mechanical movements of their eyelids, we seemed to see them saying; "This is me. I am Trouville, I am Honfleur, I am Pont-Audemer." And then there was the Etretat aerial lighthouse, which stood out from all other lighthouses and made people see it as a planet from such a distance. It indicated the route to Rouen across the sandbar at the mouth of the great river.</p>
<p>Then, on that deep water surface, on that boundless water surface that was darker than the sky, we seemed to see some stars here and there. They trembled in the night fog, appearing small, some close together, some far apart, and also appearing white, red, and green in various colors. Almost all of these stars did not move, but occasionally a few seemed to be running; these were the lights of ships that had dropped anchor and were waiting for the tide to come in, or ships that had come from afar to anchor.</p>
<p>At this moment, the moon rose from behind the city; she was like a huge and sacred lighthouse, burning in the sky to guide the endless real stars.</p>
<p>Bill murmured, almost raising his voice, "How great it is, and we are fighting over a few small coins!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, very close to him, in the large and dark trench between the two embankments, a black shadow slipped past, an incredibly huge black shadow. He leaned on the granite railing and looked down, he saw a fishing boat returning to the dock, this fishing boat passed by without a sound of people, without a sound of water, without a sound of oars, only being gently pushed forward by the large brown sail that was full of sea breeze.</p>
<p>He thought, "If we could live on this fishing boat, how peaceful we would be!" Then, as he took a few more steps forward, he saw a person sitting at the end of the embankment.</p>

<h3 id="e212">French Concession Private School Federation Asks Education Bureau to Strive for Subsidies　Chinese Education Rights Should Be Equal to Westerners　General Meeting to Be Held on the 5th of This Month to Re-elect Staff <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The Private Primary and Secondary School Federation of the French Concession of this city yesterday submitted a special report to the Municipal Education Bureau regarding the request to the French Municipal Council to allocate 20% of its total annual income to Chinese education funds, requesting that it continue to negotiate with the French authorities on the basis of reason, and scheduled a general meeting of all members to be held on the 5th of this month to re-elect executive and supervisory committee members and discuss ongoing matters. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau, the original text states: "Our association previously believed that Chinese residents in the French Concession pay a large amount of taxes every year, but the French authorities use it for Chinese education, which is less than that used for a small number of Westerners. The obligations and rights are not commensurate, favoring them over us, and neglecting Chinese education. We once proposed that from 1933, 20% of the total annual income be allocated to Chinese education funds, giving priority to subsidizing private primary and secondary schools established in the concession, in order to expand them and accommodate Chinese children, and to seek balanced development of Chinese education and Western education, and for Chinese children and Western children to receive equal treatment. We have submitted a report to your bureau repeatedly to negotiate on the basis of reason, and have been running around and calling for help, all on file. However, time has passed, although we have heard from your director about the subsidy fees for these private schools, and the French authorities have agreed to implement them from 1934, the details of the subsidy have not yet been formally announced, like a mirage that cannot be reached. We believe that your bureau, having taken responsibility for it in the past, should strive for it in the future. We respectfully request that your bureau maintain its original intention, uphold justice, and provide strong assistance from beginning to end, and continue to negotiate with the French authorities, and must clearly announce the subsidy method, so that the subsidies for primary and secondary schools in the concession can be realized as soon as possible, so as to fulfill the concerns of developing Chinese education, and to achieve equal treatment. All requests for processing are combined in this document and submitted for review, respectfully requesting that you act as requested and strive for it quickly for public convenience."</p>
<p>Notice to Members: The association's notice to members regarding the convening of a general meeting states: "We respectfully inform you that, upon investigation, the first item discussed at the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees held by our association on the 28th of this month was the date of the members' general meeting. It was decided that the members' general meeting would be held at Juebei Vegetarian Restaurant on Songshan Road at 10:00 AM on November 5th to re-elect staff. A dinner will be held after the meeting. Those who wish to participate should bring a meal fee of one yuan. The record is on file, in addition to the official letter, a corresponding record is sent to inform you, hoping you will check and attend on time."</p>

<p>The Philippine Overseas Chinese basketball team defeated Qianghua yesterday with a score of 45 to 43. The situation in the game was quite tense, as both sides were evenly matched, making the competition fierce. After the start, the Philippine Overseas Chinese team gained momentum and scored six consecutive points. Afterwards, the two teams were evenly matched and made their own contributions. Qianghua often lagged behind by six or seven points. At the end of the first half, the Philippine Overseas Chinese team had 27 points, while Qianghua had 20. As the second half began, the Philippine Overseas Chinese team's momentum remained strong and they scored frequently. Qianghua's guards, Wu Youliang and Lin Zequn, were unable to cover everything, and the forwards were unable to defend effectively, which led to openings. After the score reached 41 to 31, Qianghua suddenly fought bravely, with Chen Xianglong and Zhou Xuexian making contributions from time to time. In an instant, they scored seven consecutive points, showing a momentum of rapid ascent and overtaking the lead, reducing the gap to three points, making the situation even more tense. At this time, the Philippine Overseas Chinese team became more vigilant, and Xu Zeyao and Lin Dengxu took the opportunity to score two more points, making the score 45 to 38. At that time, there were still about three minutes left. Qianghua suffered this setback and wanted to turn the tide, but it was too late. Still unwilling to show weakness, they made a final struggle and scored five more points, making the score 45 to 43. The Philippine Overseas Chinese team won by two points.</p>

<p>The third Youyou Cup Tennis Tournament, which has been delayed due to various reasons since its start, finally concluded yesterday, which is a fortunate event. According to the results of this tournament, Yu Tianguang and Liang Deguang both tied for the lead with 26 points each. According to the rules, a best-of-three series was adopted to determine the champion. The two played the final yesterday on the club's court. Yu defeated Liang with a score of 2-0, thus Yu Tianguang won the championship for three consecutive years, which is commendable. Yesterday, Liang had many unforced errors in the first set, leading Yu to win with a score of 6-2. The second set was quite tense, with Liang once leading 5-3. However, Yu remained calm throughout and won 8-6. The Youyou Cup thus concluded with this 2-0 score. It is reported that the club also held a members' tournament, which was divided into three groups: A, B, and C, and has also concluded. The champions and runners-up of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Youyou Cup</p>
<p>Champion: Yu Tianguang Runner-up: Liang Deguang Third Place: Zheng Zhaogui</p>

<p>Defeats Hong Yukui Two to Zero</p>
<p>Sun Huang Confrontation Today Will Be a Thrilling Battle</p>
<p>Yesterday's China Youth Handball Ranking Tournament match between Zhu Kuan'an and Hong Yukui attracted an unprecedented number of spectators. The match started at 5:30 PM. When the two players appeared on the court, there was thunderous applause. In the first game, Zhu served first, and Hong immediately returned the serve. The two players persisted against each other, and neither gained an advantage for three or four times. Then, Zhu's skillful moves and unique tactics emerged endlessly, and the score soared. Hong tried hard to cope with the situation, but both sides had great skills in shooting, blocking, and saving. Zhu's left-handed shot was particularly impressive. As a result, Zhu won the first game with a score of 21-7. In the second game, Hong was unwilling to show weakness and followed closely, and the score was closer. However, he was still no match for Zhu's divine and ingenious calculations, and lost again with a score of 11-21. Zhu still gloriously ranked first and securely maintained his original position. Yan Zhaorong and Ye Tong were in the same group. Cai (surname missing) and Ye (surname missing) won without a fight. Two group matches will be held today. Sun Daosheng will face Huang Kesu, and a thrilling battle is expected. Huang has been promoted several levels and has great prospects. Sun is older and his physical strength is far less than before. The outcome today is 70-80% in favor of Huang.</p>

<p>The National Defense and Sports: Zhang Yuanruo's Reflections on the National Games, Preliminary Ideas on Reforming Sports Policies</p>
<p>The Fifth National Games were held this year on Double Tenth Day at the Central Stadium in the capital. The nation's elite and athletes from all directions have been in high spirits for the past ten days. In front of the late Premier, at the foot of Zijin Mountain, they displayed their skills. Central figures either offered personal experiences or hosted grand banquets with solemn enthusiasm, unprecedented in scale. However, at a time when the people are impoverished, resources are exhausted, and starvation fills the roads, the nation has spared no expense, investing a massive sum of over a million [currency] to build this long-abandoned, occasionally used Central Stadium. The direct and indirect costs for the central government and various provinces and cities participating in this grand event must amount to over a million [currency] as well. This is not merely for decoration or extravagance; it is a profound and far-reaching plan for the future of the nation.</p>
<p>Now, as the grand event concludes, thousands of spectators take home their lingering enthusiasm. National public opinion is unanimously expressing its sincere admiration and consolation to the athletes. It is said that the sporting achievements have broken or equaled three Far Eastern Games records and broken numerous national records, especially in track and field and swimming. However, given the current situation and the times we live in, the author humbly questions whether our nation's current sports education policy, which focuses solely on running, jumping, and chasing, is a wise choice, and whether breaking records should be the sole objective.</p>
<p>The misguided sports policies of the past have led to various unhealthy phenomena in sports. People have followed suit, and so-called sports have become a profession for general athletes. They are undisciplined, dissolute, and degenerate in normal times and after training. On the field, they only seek personal glory and engage in reckless fights, without self-assessment or discipline. School authorities often use underhanded tactics to buy off athletes, using them as advertisements for the school's reputation, indulging and enticing them, and treating them as rare commodities. They completely ignore the cultivation of athletes' moral character. Even worse, the relationship between athletes and educators is exactly the same as that between circus owners and their tigers, leopards, and lions, or beggars and their monkeys (see "Shaoxing, Sports Don't Forget Reading," October 18). According to police expert Ding Fubao, "In every sports meet in the East and West, many athletes develop lung diseases after strenuous competitions. Sports promotion in our country in recent years has been extremely popular, but if students have latent tuberculosis and their resistance is not strong, the disease will erupt once broken down by competitive sports. Therefore, these students can only participate in small exercises and should rest. Strenuous exercises for long periods are tantamount to constructing their own deaths." In the past, Mr. Gu Zheng from Shanghai and Mr. Xue Jianyi from Wuxi, known for their involvement in sports, both suddenly died of acute pulmonary tuberculosis. Countless unknown heroes have developed lung diseases due to strenuous exercise (see Ding's preface to his "Guide to Lung Disease," published in the October 2nd Early Morning News). These views may be biased, but if our nation's sports education could adopt the principles of universality, rationality, practicality, perseverance, moderation, discipline, and cooperation as its guidelines and as standards for evaluating achievements and judging merits, rather than focusing solely on breaking records and inciting private fights, then these unhealthy phenomena would naturally not occur.</p>
<p>I cite this not to say that sports can be neglected (see my "The Fighting Spirit of the Nation," published in the Current Affairs News, which proves my position). As the ancient saying goes, "As Heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman should constantly strive for self-improvement." Our nation's sages have always ranked archery and horsemanship alongside ritual, music, writing, and mathematics as the Six Arts. They have also regarded courage, knowledge, and benevolence as the three pillars, considering them essential virtues. The ancient Western philosopher Plato also considered "courage" as one of the four virtues that people in his ideal state should possess. Since the Jin, Wei, and Six Dynasties, our people have been decadent and unable to recover. Given the deep weakness of our nation, promoting sports is a national policy that cannot be ignored for the purpose of revitalizing the country and seeking strength in the future.</p>
<p>However, promoting sports emphasizes the establishment of sound sports policies and the correction of misguided sports policies. Sports in China over the past two or three decades have only focused on schools. The objective is small and lacks an overall organization and a complete system. This has led a small number of people engaged in sports to hold onto their own narrow views, defaming each other, and failing to cooperate. At this time of foreign aggression, our nation's sports policy should expand its target audience and improve its spirit, with the revival of the nation as its foundation. We should promptly promote the easiest to popularize and most practical sports, such as swimming, weightlifting, hiking, calisthenics, and martial arts, to ensure that sports in the future are nationalized, collectivized, and militarized. On the one hand, we must avoid becoming aristocratic and Westernized. On the other hand, we must integrate martial arts with military affairs, creating the simplest, most practical, and nation-reviving Chinese sports system. Since the European War, countries around the world have had a particularly clear understanding of sports, and their objectives are also different from before. As for teaching materials and methods, they all focus on stimulating national struggle, strengthening the minds and bodies of young people and the masses, and incorporating military purposes into sports (see Cheng Qike's "The Purpose of Reviving the National Foundation Through Sports," published on October 16). Do our nation's current sports policies, the spirit of sports, and the meaning of various assessments and sports styles conform to the new trends of the modern world and meet the needs of our nation? This is what we should deeply reflect on amidst the excitement, cheers, and praise.</p>
<p>Since the revolution in Soviet Russia, the number of athletes nationwide increased to 800,000 in 1928, 1.1 million in 1930, 3.1 million in 1932, and suddenly increased to 6 million in 1935. This sharp increase in numbers truly indicates that sports have become integrated with the people (see the Current Affairs News, October 13). Soviet Russia calls its national games not "games" but "National Defense and Production Examination." Any young person who has one of the following two conditions: (1) possessing a specialized production skill that allows them to work tirelessly for long periods; (2) possessing a specialized and refined war skill (such as using weapons, live ammunition shooting, hand grenades, fencing, horseback riding, and sailing), will be awarded a gold medal by the government, known as the first-class athlete in the country. This has a profound impact, truly nationalizing sports for national defense and production (see the Morning Post editorial, October 22). After the war, Mussolini in Italy also regarded sports as a way to revive the nation, deeply penetrating all levels of society. Given the current precarious state of our nation and the urgency of national defense, if we continue to follow the sports methods of European and American countries, merely imitating their running, jumping, and playful techniques, using athletes' qualifications as an excuse to skip classes and avoid exams, seeking the vanity of the nation by breaking records, and collectively abandoning all of our ancestral culture, artifacts and technologies while indulging in modern superficiality and extravagance, not only will it not save our nation from poverty and weakness, but it will lead our nation to a path of decline. Education Minister Tu Shijie stated the following goals for sports at the opening ceremony: (1) To implement the idea of integrating sports and moral education, being equally responsible for the physical and moral health of students. (2) Each athlete should strive for a goal that is not romantic or degenerate, always maintaining a lofty attitude and a spirit of hard work. The President gave a speech to all the athletes, saying, "The meaning of sports is not limited to physical training, but especially in mental training. Every athlete, in terms of private morals, should pay attention to physical and mental cleanliness, and eliminate all bad habits. In terms of public morals, all actions should be collective and disciplined; otherwise, being scattered and disorganized will inevitably lead to courage in private fights but cowardice in public battles. With twelve points of courage and perseverance, take on the responsibility of transforming weakness into strength. May your moral character be as clean as water, your patriotism be as fierce as fire, and your spirit and body be as strong as steel."</p>
<p>Alas, the world is changing rapidly, and the nation is facing imminent destruction. The responsibility for revitalization and self-strengthening falls on no one else. Athletes, the nation's elite, should remember the profound farewell words of the national education officials, recognize the precarious situation of the Chinese nation, deeply understand the significance of this sports meet in strengthening the race and revitalizing the country, take on the responsibility of restoring China and defending the country, strive forward and act vigorously, do not indulge in playing with things and lose your ambition, work hard and practice diligently, be afraid of private fights and be brave in public battles, do not be calculating about the victory or defeat of individuals, or be concerned about the shortness of the day, you should diligently seek the health of your own body and mind in order to forge your courage and ability to produce and fight for the nation. Then the outcome of this conference will not be an extravagant display of success or a meaningless waste, but will have a different and great value. October 1933, in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Officialdom <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xian</p>
<p>"Raising the right hand, swearing to take office," and "Resigning repeatedly, telegraphing resignation" -- these two things, except for those who do not read newspapers, or who read newspapers but only look at "Today's Great Light Reflects the All-Powerful Woman," or "Mei Lanfang Will Take the Stage Soon" friends, generally feel that this is "rise and fall in officialdom" common meal, and nothing more.</p>
<p>But if we close our eyes and think about it, then, in this common meal of "rise and fall in officialdom," there are many incredible flavors.</p>
<p>In every letter of resignation, there are always sentences that bring tears to the eyes, such as "exhausted from overwork" and "mentally and physically exhausted." Even "repeatedly resigning" fully expresses the pain of "not being allowed to get rid of the official hat." It can be seen that being an official is not as enjoyable as we ordinary people who have never been officials imagine. And those who want to get rid of the official hat resign once, twice, and even three times, being held back by the arm and not allowed to throw it away. It is said that this is because there is no suitable successor, and there is a sense that "if this gentleman leaves, what will happen to the people?" Therefore, officials who understand "enduring hardship and resentment," although they suffer, are not easy to resign.</p>
<p>But if an official who "endures hardship and resentment" really "becomes ill from overwork" and "mentally and physically exhausted" and resigns again and again, then who will be willing to take over is another great problem. Although on the one hand, "the resignation is just approved," on the other hand, someone has already been "appointed" to a certain position, but as soon as someone raises their right hand and swears to take office, there must immediately be a telegram of "firm refusal is not accepted, reluctantly taking on difficult tasks" to express one hundred and twenty thousand points of grievance, and it is not that they love to put the official hat on their heads.</p>
<p>Therefore, we really cannot regard the rise and fall between "a new official taking office and an old official leaving" as a trivial matter, but should realize that this is another batch jumping into the fire pit.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see the boredom of "officialdom," so only a non-fool should be an official. Even "three visits to the thatched cottage, and firm refusal is not accepted," at most, one can only "reluctantly take on difficult tasks, waiting for the capable," and as soon as there is an opportunity, one should withdraw cleanly to give way to the capable. Ji Hongchang and Fang Zhenwu were utterly defeated, but still asked for "name" and "military commander," really fools. There are also some unnamed alternate officials who are always waving eight-line letters and running around to curry favor with the powerful, desperately wanting to float and sink in officialdom, which is even more foolish to the extreme.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Pirated Books <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>A few years ago, piracy was not a problem. You could print "All rights reserved, reproduction will be prosecuted," and people would turn a blind eye. Recently, the publishing industry in Shanghai has refused to give up and is gradually paying attention to this. Once discovered, they would negotiate, and if reconciliation fails, they would seek legal remedies. If the piracy is in a remote place, they can only open their eyes wide and wring their hands without a solution.</p>
<p>Now some clever people do not pirate Chinese books, but pirate foreign books. It may be said that the Chinese publishing industry has not joined the International Copyright Alliance, and can legally evade responsibility, and there is only something that cannot be said morally. In fact, this is a high-sounding statement. The magic lies in the fact that the original publisher is tens of thousands of miles away, so-called out of reach.</p>
<p>However, due to the exorbitant price of gold and the meager purchasing power of students, they must be allowed to choose convenient purchases. Therefore, two interesting things happened in our Suzhou:</p>
<p>One is that the foreign principal of School A absolutely forbids students from buying pirated foreign books in order to maintain his foreign morality. And the Chinese principal of School B said to the foreign teacher, "We Chinese have more important rights than books that have been invaded by foreigners." Therefore, School B allows students to do as they please.</p>
<p>One is that the ethics professor of School C is a foreigner and asked the students, "Are you willing to buy pirated books?" Because this question is related to ethics itself, it is difficult for the students to answer, so they have to remain silent. The foreign professor then asked, "How much is the price difference between the original and the pirated version?" One student answered, "The original version requires more than fourteen yuan, and the pirated version does not cost more than four yuan." The foreign professor smiled and then remained silent.</p>
<p>Recently, an American chemist said in the preface to the reprinted edition of his chemistry textbook: "I am very happy to see a Chinese pirated book." This chemist has a lot of humor.</p>
<h3 id="e235">What Does it Mean <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Dao An</p>
<p>People's age, of course, increases year by year, but the age of modern women not only does not increase, but also greatly reverses. For example, she was twenty-four years old last year, but this year, she only says she is twenty-two years old. Next year, she may even regress to eighteen or nineteen years old. What does this mean?</p>
<p>The number of times that modern women use mirrors to look at their faces, calculated on average per day, is probably more than a hundred times, right? From getting up, washing their faces, putting on makeup, drawing eyebrows, applying powder, applying rouge, putting on lipstick, putting on clothes, putting on shoes, or when going out, in addition to horizontal and vertical reflections, they also look in the mirror when walking and sitting in the car. When watching plays and movies, they always take special photos. If someone gives her a Liu Zhen stare, her mirror work becomes even busier. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Women have the right for two or three people to sit in a rickshaw, while men can only sigh at the sight of the car and cannot enjoy this right. What does this mean?</p>
<p>The filial sons of the bereaved family mostly line a piece of red cloth on the heels of the hemp shoes they wear during the initial mourning period. What does this mean?</p>
<p>People who mess around in the sea of love mostly end up disappointed in love (except for the rich). There are few who are successful in love. What does this mean?</p>
<h3 id="e236">Not Valuing Sons, Valuing Daughters <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>For thousands of years, we Chinese have had a tradition and concept, that is, "valuing sons and belittling daughters." It is said that "daughters are money-losing goods." When a daughter is born, she is raised with great difficulty, and then given away to someone else. People feel that it is not easy. Look, those who choose a son-in-law for their daughters, poor households certainly do not want a son-in-law who is not a rich man, and rich families dislike the official not being handsome. Even if our old man likes what he sees, he does not know what our daughter thinks. This is wrong, that is not a match, how much trouble! Although it is said that everyone now emphasizes freedom, this fee for a free son-in-law is enough for you to bear. The first is to send them to school to study, and the second is to dress them up like flowers, so that someone will pursue them, so that they can be free and fall in love. When they fall in love and succeed, you need not worry about how little dowry there is that the father can bear. Otherwise, you will be looked down upon, and your daughter will have a hard time in the world. As for saying that the son-in-law is half a son to depend on, this is a joke and a strange tale. You must know that the son-in-law, Mr. Official, is somewhat polite, no matter how you depend on him; only your son can handle the funeral when you are old. Is it possible to call the son-in-law to hold the head and claim to be an orphan? Alas! For thousands of years, we Chinese have had the concept of "valuing sons and belittling daughters," perhaps for all the reasons mentioned above?</p>
<p>However, since ancient times, there have been many who have relied on their daughters to enjoy wealth and glory. As long as your daughter is as beautiful as an angel, and can win people's praise as an "angel," that is your good fortune and endless hope. At the very least, she does not need you to worry when she goes out alone. Naturally, there are many volunteer bodyguards who follow her around, and if she encounters a stray dog, it will definitely not bite her thigh. As for the question of choosing a son-in-law, naturally, you do not need to worry at all. Not to mention foreign firms and bank executives wanting to become related, even the rich people have to ask matchmakers to say that the marriage is reasonable. At that time, the mother-in-law looks at the son-in-law, and the more she looks, the more interesting he becomes. Is there still the idea of "valuing sons and belittling daughters"?</p>
<p>Alas! Originally, in this world, saying "valuing sons and belittling daughters" is really the number one fool. You must know that "not valuing sons but valuing daughters" is the only hope.</p>

<p>— Pin Shan</p>
<p>Some people say: "Mr. Gu Yanwu's famous saying: "The rise and fall of the world is everyone's responsibility." The word "responsibility" should be changed to "debt." Look, in today's country, internal and external debts are stacked on top of each other, and old debts have not been cleared, and new debts are coming. All of these debts, in the end, are borne by our ordinary people. Isn't this called: "The rise and fall of the world is everyone's debt?""</p>

<p>Chapter 18: Silently Passing Tea to Comfort Her Husband, Hurriedly Leaving the Border, Forcing a Smile to Say Goodbye to Her Family</p>
<p>Old Zhao knew that the sigh contained a great deal of unsaid words. But if he really spoke them out, his son would probably be unable to bear it. Because in the past two days, he had heard a lot of idle talk from Mrs. Jiang. The meaning was always that the girl was originally afraid of marrying a soldier, because soldiers are not easy to be at home often. Now that they are just engaged, the son-in-law is about to leave, and this matter will be difficult to say in the future. This time, Old Zhao did not wait for him to say the words, and immediately grabbed the words and said: There are long-distance buses from Xifengkou to Beijing, and you can come back in more than a day. In the future, when we have a happy event, we are willing to go to Xifengkou to hold it there. If we are not willing to go to Xifengkou, Ziqiang can come back when the day comes, it's not a big deal. Zhao Ziqiang said: That's right, it's very convenient to come and go. Mrs. Jiang was silent for five minutes, and then said: When the son-in-law leaves, he will be promoted and make money, this is a good thing. Naturally, he will win every battle and achieve success immediately, what else can I say? It would be good if we could do it according to the son-in-law's way of doing things. Zhao Ziqiang felt that these words were getting closer and closer to complaining, so he changed the subject and said: Dad, I also thought of one thing. Company Commander Tian said that he had already called Miss Huang Manying twice, asking him to come to Haidian, but he could not leave to go to the city. According to my meaning, if Miss Huang comes, please ask him to rest here for one night. We will leave tomorrow, anyway, we will pass through Haidian Street, so we will meet. It is best to ask you to hire someone to go to the city and ask him to leave the city immediately. Then, when I return to the camp, I can ask Company Commander Tian to come here once. Mrs. Jiang smiled faintly and said: You have this time to take care of other people's business. Although this was a joke, Zhao Ziqiang felt that these words were twenty-four points serious, so he smiled and said: Last night, the departure time has not been determined yet, Company Commander Tian was saying this, today I am back, I naturally want to think about this matter.

<h3 id="e239">Interview with Liang Tongfang <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Yu</p>
<p>After the fall of the Northeast, those with a bit of spirit in the country were extremely indignant. I think everyone feels the same way except for the non-resistance general. But as time passed, the call for resistance gradually weakened. Opening the newspaper, the words "resistance against Japan" gradually decreased. The names and whereabouts of general anti-Japanese comrades are not easy to see. Not long ago, there was an anti-Japanese major general, Jiang Minsheng, who ended up in Shanghai, shining shoes for people. Recently, there has been an anti-Japanese comrade, Liang Tongfang, pulling a rickshaw. The result of resisting Japan is like this, while those who do not resist Japan are living a life of enjoyment, spending their days drinking and having fun. Compared, it is really both ridiculous and sad. Since the news of Liang Tongfang was spread in various newspapers, I have been a friend of Lawyer Yao Zhaoli, and Liang often appears at the door of Lawyer Yao, so I especially asked Lawyer Yao to make an appointment with Liang yesterday afternoon. At about five o'clock, I met with Liang at Lawyer Yao's office. Liang has a fair complexion and is of medium height. He is wearing a khaki Zhongshan suit and is very kind. He is from Yu Ren, Zhejiang. He has done business in money houses. When the January 28th Incident occurred, he joined the Shanghai Citizens' Volunteer Army. Later, he served as a student in General Weng Zhaoyuan's unit. After the term expired, he joined the Shanghai Student Army Northeast Volunteer Group and went to the front line to fight. At that time, he wanted to go straight to Huanglong, but who knew that the result would be like this. After coming to Shanghai, because it was not easy to find a suitable job for a while, he decided to pull a rickshaw to support himself and was unwilling to accept any financial assistance from relatives and friends. He had been in Shanghai for several days, because he was an amateur in renting a rickshaw and did not know the procedure. After running for five or six days, there was still no result. Fortunately, Lawyer Yao's cousin, Ms. Ruifang, had an introduction letter for him to see Yao when she came south. At that time, Lawyer Yao's intention was to provide him with economic assistance, but Liang resolutely declined, saying that pulling a rickshaw was not a bad profession. In the end, Lawyer Yao had to find a way to rent a rickshaw for him, with a daily rent of six jiao and five fen of silver dollars.</p>
<p>When I met Liang, he had only been pulling a rickshaw for the fourth day. It is said that once he pulled a guest who said he wanted to go to a certain place in the French Concession, but suddenly asked him to pull him to the door of a restaurant outside the New North Gate. After the man jumped out of the car, he looked at Liang carefully and suddenly asked Liang if he was the Liang mentioned in the newspaper who was an anti-Japanese comrade. Liang initially did not answer, but after he insisted on asking, he had to say yes. The man was very happy and insisted on inviting him in to eat together. Liang refused, but was eventually picked up by him and brought in. It is said that this man's surname is Tu and he runs a cotton wool factory on Longhua Road. After reading the newspaper, he expressed great sympathy for Liang. There is also a Feixing Car Company, which sent several bicycles to search for the rickshaw with his information in order to find Liang. In the end, they found it and invited him to talk for half a day. Reporters from other newspapers and news agencies went to Lawyer Yao's office to interview him in an endless stream.</p>
<p>I asked Liang how his whereabouts became known to newspaper reporters. Liang said: I have been in Shanghai for many days. I want to pull a rickshaw because I want to use it as a temporary profession. As soon as there is an anti-Japanese opportunity, I still want to go out. I don't want to use this to show off, but that day I was at Lawyer Yao's place, and a reporter from Fuxing News Agency happened to be here. So Lawyer Yao introduced him and the reporter talked. The next day, many newspapers published the news.</p>
<p>Finally, Liang said: I am very lucky to be able to return to Shanghai. There are still seven comrades who went with me who are still in the snow and ice. Because they have no financial assistance, they are very distressed and cannot return. Now that resisting Japan has become a thing of the past, I sincerely hope that all circles in Shanghai can find a way to rescue them. The names of the seven comrades are Zhang Muren, Zhu Xueming, Huang Xiegen, Yu Gengsheng, Ni Huaixin, Jin Zhong, and Zou Tianxi. After Liang finished speaking, he couldn't help but sigh. Coincidentally, another newspaper reporter came to visit, so I took my leave.</p>
<p>At this time, the lights of thousands of homes had long been lit, and the music in the dance hall was ringing. Champagne...inside...happy...a drunken soul will never know the pain of a country's destruction!</p>

<p>The gold market continued to decline yesterday, briefly falling below the $50 mark in off-exchange trading. However, the situation stabilized after the opening. The market was able to recover after hitting a new low. In the morning, overseas silver markets in Britain and the US both rose, with forward silver prices on the Gold Exchange increasing by 8 to 12 mils. Exchange rates also rose across the board. London spot gold rose by 1 shilling and 2 pence. The US official gold buying price was $32.26, up 14 cents from the previous day. Stocks rose by $1.45. US cotton rose by 2 basis points, and US wheat fell by 2.875 basis points. The wool market initially opened at $512, then retreated to $489, before rebounding to $545, where it fluctuated. Yuan Mao Yong Da De Cheng Heng Yu Da Fa Yong and others were actively buying, while Heng Xing and Bing Xing were selling, with retail investors also actively selling. Despite this, Yuan Mao Yong continued to buy aggressively, keeping the market relatively stable. After the opening, the market immediately declined, but did not break the $50 mark. It was anticipated that HSBC's exchange rate would be flat for British currency and up only 25 cents for US currency. The Japanese banks adjusted the US exchange rate, causing the gold price to rise and then fluctuate. Reuters reported that the director of the Financial Readjustment Association announced that gold would be purchased abroad starting today. This news caused prices to weaken. The market was stable at noon, but in off-exchange trading, it immediately broke below the $50 mark. Reuters also reported that the US President had reviewed charts of the number of workers and total wages, and found that the recovery program was progressing well. In addition, the director of the Financial Readjustment Association, Jones, formally ordered the Federal Reserve to raise gold prices abroad starting tomorrow, and similar actions were planned in France. This news caused panic and rumors, making it difficult to revive the market. Unexpectedly, there was a rumor that American merchants in Shanghai opposed the government's issuance of additional paper money, causing a sharp rebound. This was another repeat of the recent pattern of short covering at the close. The settlement price was $1,120. The day's market conditions are summarized below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $751.8, down $12.5 from the previous close. Goods opened at $1.5.

Banque Franco-Chinoise offered US dollars for January at 1875, causing the price to fall to $50. Heng Yu, Fu Yu, and Yuan Mao Yong were all active buyers. It was anticipated that HSBC's exchange rate would be flat for British currency and up only 25 cents for US currency, causing the price to rise to $3.5.

Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Tong Tai Chang, Da Fa Yong, Fu Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, and others repeatedly bought, gradually raising the price to $5. Mitsui adjusted US dollars for March at 4375. Yong Feng sold, causing the market to decline, but Zhao Feng Chang's buying kept it stable for a time. Later, due to the difficulty of selling US dollars for March at 4375, and with supply from Yong Feng, Da Xing Yong, Bing Xing, Dalian merchants, and Hong Xing, the price fell to $2.2. HSBC accepted US dollars for February at 3125 and struggled around $3. News was unfavorable. Yi Da Yong, Fu Yu, Tong Xing Yong, Heng Yu, and others sold down to $1. Citibank purchased US dollars for February at 3125, causing a rebound and then fluctuation. During this period, the market fluctuated without significant changes for quite some time. Later, Zhi Feng, Yong Fu Yu, Heng Yu, and Ri Chang sold again, causing it to retreat to $1.2. Qian Chang Xiang took advantage of the low price to buy and stabilize. Fu Yu and Heng Yu bought after selling. Mitsui purchased US dollars for February at 3125 again, causing it to rise to $3.8. The noon closing was $753.2, with goods trading at $2, and finally retreating to around $2.</p>

Zhejiang accepted March at 6875. Da Fa Yong, Fu Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Qian Chang Xiang, Hong Li Yi Yu, and Yong Feng all bought, causing it to rise to $50. Heng Yu, Fu Yu, and Zhao Feng Chang suddenly sold, causing it to gradually retreat to $48.2. HSBC purchased February at half a yuan. De Cheng, Zhi Chang, and Zhao Feng Chang accepted again, bringing it to $9.6. However, due to uncertainty, Da De Cheng Chang Sheng and Yong Rui Kang sold, causing it to fall to $7.2. Mercantile Bank adjusted US dollars for March at 75, causing it to rise but still decline, as Heng Yu and Zeng Lai Xian sold. Later, banks resisted US dollars for March at 75 and February at 5625. Si Da, Fu Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Da Fa Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, and Da De Cheng jointly bought, and favorable foreign news stabilized and revived the market. In an instant, it rebounded to $52.8. Zhi Feng, Yong Zhao Feng Chang, and Bing Xing sold, and after fluctuating, the closing was $752. After the market closed, Bing Xing, Chun Yuan, Yong Yuan Heng, and others advanced, bringing it to over $3. Goods were at $2.5. The highest price during the day was $755, and the lowest was $747, a difference of $8. As a result, it continued to fall by $12.3 from the previous close.</p>
<p>The indicative price was $774 due to HSBC's US dollar exchange rate rising by 25 cents to $31, equivalent to the gold price. Based on the closing price, it was discounted by about $22, which was $6 more than the previous close. Account closing for this month was $761, and for December was $753.

<p>Trading in the exchange was active. Yuan Mao Yong, Zhao Feng Chang, Yuan Heng, Tong Tai Chang, Da De Cheng, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Xing Shui, Da Fa Yong, Yi Feng, Yong Rui Xing, and Heng Chang Yong were mainly on the buying side, while Shunli, Heng Xing, Bing Xing, Da Chang Xiang, Rui Kang Heng, Yu Da Kang Chang Sheng Yong, and Hong Xing Ri Chang were on the selling side.

Guangdong merchants and Heng Xing sold over 600 strips, buying a small number. There were a total of 26,719 lots for December.</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange announced yesterday that on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of this month, which are the days for the Western merchants' autumn and spring horse races, the exchange will be open as usual in the morning and closed in the afternoon on each of these three days. This announcement is hereby made.</p>

The market seemed strong initially, but HSBC's exchange rate announcement showed flat for British currency and only a 25 cent increase for US currency, causing some tightness. After entering the market, the situation fluctuated without much change. Trading in shillings was relatively active. Conflicting news in the after-market led to strengthening, but banks adjusted, leading to stabilization, and finally, tightness.

<h3 id="e245">Securities and Bond Market: Minor Fluctuations, Discrepancies in Various Bonds, Most Buyers and Sellers Waiting and Watching <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market was relatively stable. Although market prices fluctuated, the fluctuations were not significant. Both sides were generally cautious, which is common at the beginning of the month. However, the large number of accounts held by both sides suggests that brewing is still underway, and any upheaval in the future could be substantial. Although there were rumors about the political situation, they were not credible, as the time was not yet right. Market conditions were weak, and it was difficult to determine whether large amounts of funds were being released for later repurchase. At the opening yesterday morning, the initial trades were promising. Demobilization bonds rose sharply by 60-70 cents, while the 19th-year bonds were relatively stable. From the 20th-year bonds onward, the market suddenly weakened, falling by 20-30 cents. Different bonds performed differently depending on the year, which is typical in a market with limited trading. In the second session, retail investors sold slightly, causing all bonds to weaken by a small amount, ranging from 10 to 40 cents. However, salt tax bonds were relatively stable. In the afternoon, most of the earlier bonds were flat, while the 20th-year bonds were slightly stronger, with the closing prices generally rebounding by 5 to 20 cents. The overall trend for the day was fluctuating, but it was unlikely to remain stable for long. Market prices resulted in demobilization bonds, near-term bonds, and enterprise short 96 gold long bonds rising slightly by 10-20 cents, while the rest fell by 10-40 cents. The total transaction volume was 9.04 million yuan. Spot trading remained inactive. Futures contracts, including salt tax bonds, totaled 3.6005 million, accounting for over one-third of the total volume. Demobilization bonds also accounted for 1.385 million. 19th-year customs bonds totaled 1.09 million. 20th-year bonds totaled 1.495 million. Reorganization bonds and gold short bonds each accounted for around 300,000-400,000, while the rest ranged from tens of thousands to over ten thousand.</p>

<p>According to a report from the New Feng Foreign Firm, the New York stock market was lackluster on the 1st. The market was stable at the opening, but due to news of a ban on speculative trading, which was later denied, and a decline in the wheat market, the stock market also fell. At the close, due to unconfirmed reports that the government would purchase silver domestically and abroad and devalue the gold standard, silver and metal stocks strengthened, and the stock market also rebounded. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,140,000 shares. "Wheat" buyers were uncertain, and longs liquidated, causing the market to decline and trading to be dull. "Cotton" market conditions were hesitant due to the possibility of increased cotton production. Private estimates put this year's cotton production at 13,500,000 bales. The cotton textile market was quiet. The possibility of resolving British war debts was a key factor driving the cotton market. Manufacturers continued to purchase. "Silver" speculators bought due to frequent rumors of silver legislation. The silver market closed strong. The Financial Reconstruction Corporation's gold price was $32.26 per ounce, up $0.14. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is gradually weakening, but buyers remain resilient and unwilling to let go. Market conditions are very gloomy, and business is declining. General speculators are taking a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a stalemate. However, the environment is unfavorable, and some association is absorbing large quantities of spot yarn, making it difficult to predict future developments.</p>

<p>The opening price of Human cotton in the forward market was affected by flat US cotton prices and the sharp decline in gold prices, causing market sentiment to weaken. Prices for all months fell by 3, 5, and 6 cents. In the afternoon, hearing that spot yarn transactions were sluggish, prices for all months fell by 1, 2, and 3 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,300 bales. YU Kang sold 1,150 bales, Chang Feng sold 1,650 bales, Da Feng sold 800 bales, and Fu Da sold 1,300 bales. Yong Chang bought 400 bales, Da Chang bought 700 bales, Ren Feng bought 400 bales, Shen Ji bought 600 bales, Chang Ji bought 550 bales, and Tong Fu bought 350 bales.

<p>Guangdong 240 Nanjing 10 Ningbo 15 Fellow Traders 15</p>
<p>The cotton market was slightly weaker. US cotton prices were flat, exchange rates rose, and gold prices fell sharply, suggesting that local cotton prices may decline. However, there is a lack of new sellers, and the transaction volume for the current month is still substantial, and there is no smooth access to the market from all sources, so the bulls are quite strong. However, private estimates of US cotton have increased again, so spot cotton transactions can still be maintained. Future conditions are increasingly difficult to predict.</p>

Egyptian cotton spot rose ten points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to buying by retail investors and Japanese merchants, but then fell due to selling by speculators. As a result, Pinggar remained unchanged, and Oumla, Bailuoqi, and Jun fell by half a rupee. The original telegram is listed below (dated the 1st):</p>

<p>In the flour market yesterday morning, there were rumors of a tax on foreign wheat. Market sentiment was agitated and buyers did their best to purchase, causing a sharp rise, which was rarely seen before. Prices for all months rose sharply, with the current month rising by as much as $2.2, and the forward months even more so, with prices exceeding the previous day's closing price by 50-60 cents. In the afternoon, it was confirmed that this tax was not to be fully believed, and the major factories did their best to sell, short sellers increased their positions, and long sellers returned, causing an even more dramatic decline. Prices suddenly fell by a significant amount of about one dollar in five rounds. The closing price saw a decline, with the closing price for December being down by 3.5 cents, the current month down by 2.25 cents, February down by 3 cents, March down by 2.5 cents, and April down by 2 cents.</p>
<p>The wheat market yesterday saw dramatic changes, with a sharp rise in the morning and a dramatic decline in the afternoon, with fluctuations of over one dollar during the day. The market rose sharply in the morning due to rumors that a tax on foreign wheat would be implemented, with January rising by 1.8 cents and other months rising by 1.6-1 cent. In the afternoon, it was confirmed that foreign wheat prices had fallen, and the government had agreed to lend 15,000 tons of US wheat at a price of only $4.15, and it was rumored that a total of 25,000 tons were involved. As a result, various parties competed to sell, and prices immediately fell by over one dollar. The closing price for the current month remained the same as the previous day, the next month was up by 3 cents, and the remaining months were up by 5 cents.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were sources from over 50 firms, totaling over 7,000 shi of goods. Kiln medium and low quality rice continued to move at 1,500-1,600 bales, but the market situation showed signs of weakening because the Northern market prices depreciated, selling at only $9. As a result, it was difficult for customers to make a profit, causing the buying side to suddenly become critical. As a result, although sellers tried to raise prices once, they were ultimately unable to reverse the trend, and prices were adjusted down by a small amount. 2,000-3,000 shi of Suzhou Tong粳 had a way to go. The situation was upward, and market prices continued to rise by nearly a foot. As for Nangang and other high-quality thick rice, stores still sold over 1,000 shi, but with the arrival of more goods, prices did not fluctuate much. Many Du Yang tip arrived as well, and there was a good way to go. The market situation was very chaotic. As a result, 3,000 shi were sold, with only a few cents of ups and downs, and it was still a stable trend. Various broken rice were stable due to seasonal factors. Yin Yuan continued to show signs of strength.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 32-33 firms arrived from the lower river areas. Sales continued, and the market for new rice, broken rice, Yangdu rice, and kiln rice was stable. However, the price of Yin Yuan increased by nearly one corner, while the price of white rice decreased by a small corner.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Guest Xian rice sales remained sluggish, and foreign rice had no sales. The market was even more sluggish. The reason for this was the influx of goods and the downward influence on market sentiment. Although customers were interested in purchasing, they waited and watched to see if the prices would fall further before purchasing. Yesterday, some owners sought to sell, and prices fell by a small corner, and only after the decline did the local merchants take the opportunity to inquire. Quanzhou merchants also dealt with 150 packs of early coarse rice. The whole city was handled by local merchants who dealt with 129 packs of Jiangxi machine-made early rice at $7.02, and 190 packs of Nanjing machine-made rice at $6.6. Quanzhou went early coarse rice 150 packs, price 5.32 yuan to 5.28 yuan, and foreign rice had 550 packs of a small pull, price 7.2 yuan, and also handled by the local merchants, each fell one corner before the market, and the current head to continue to have, the bottom is in the customer xiang rice 150,000 packs, and foreign xiang rice 250,000 packs for a total of 400,000 packs, should be the customer helps to handle is smooth, to have a turn.</p>

<p>After the price of raw peanuts plummeted, the source was slightly scarce, and there were continuous sales. The price of Xuzhou goods in the middle once fell to $6, but it has been slightly stable for the past two days. Yesterday, Cantonese merchants had already purchased, accounting for 400 tons of Shandong goods, with a price of $6.2. The peanut market was more dominant than raw peanuts because of the sparse arrival and seamless sales, the market was quite firm, and local merchants continued to handle 100 bags of Yantai goods at a price of $6.7, and more than 100 bags of Shuanggu goods at a price of $6.5.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw sluggish sales and no hope of a rebound in trend. The guild's benchmark price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 20 yuan and 9 and a half cents, but few transactions were made. The No. 20 medium granulated white sugar, with its gradually thinning inventory, was reluctant to release its stock, with a price of 20 yuan and 6 and a half cents offered but not achieved. Dutch 赤KW mark was priced at 16 yuan and 2 cents, and BDA mark at 16 yuan and 5 cents. The transfer bill of lading for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar opened at 7 yuan and 6 cents, slightly lower than the previous 6 cents, while the second-tier Zhuang brand was at 7 yuan and 5 and a half cents, with 200-300 bags traded.

Mianbai No. 1 from Zhonghua, Guohua, and Zhenji factories was priced at 19 yuan and 7 cents, with little hope of further price drops in the market. Bowl Qing (a type of tea), for immediate loading, was offered at a price of 2 yuan and 4 cents in Dutch currency for 50 tons, excluding the new foreign tax.</p>

<p>Recently, the sales of dried longans have been sluggish, and stocks have been depleted for a long time, with few transactions. However, the arrival of goods has become scarce, and the market situation is not overly flooded. The existing stocks are gradually becoming active, especially the smaller sized ones, which are seeing a more considerable sales volume. It is reported that merchants have sold 400-500 dan (a unit of weight) in recent days, priced at 21-22 yuan.</p>

<p>Rayon sales increasingly sluggish. Foreign exchange rates fluctuate, and rayon sales are increasingly quiet. Yesterday, only the Hu merchants imported 15 boxes of Peacock Red Golden Bell and other brands of spot goods, with prices ranging from 172 yuan and 2 and a half cents to 169 yuan and 5 cents net.</p>
<p>European firms show little activity in the silk market. Since autumn, the sales of silk fabrics in European and American silk factories have been in a slump, with accumulated inventories. Many have reduced working hours and stopped machinery to reduce production. In recent weeks, cotton and wool fabrics have entered the market, and the supply of raw silk exceeds demand. Coupled with the dramatic fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, silk sales are sluggish. European and American firms in Shanghai have shown no interest in forward or spot silk, and the market atmosphere is stagnant. Yesterday, only Kechang and others sold silk through brokers for nine packages, and prices remained weak.</p>
<p>Large quantities of Chinese silk shipped to Britain and France. The British company's ship, the 拉及冰脫 (Laji Bingtuo) which is a transliteration of a ship name, set sail this time, carrying a total of 550 pieces of yellow, white, factory-spun silk, and coarse silk from British, French, and Indian firms in Shanghai to ports such as London, Bombay, Marseille, and Lyon.</p>

The whole city had 余有餘洋行 (Yu Youyu Foreign Firm) buying over 500 boxes, priced between 68 and 70 yuan, a drop of 4 to 5 yuan compared to the previous price. Zhenmei, Zhenmei Needle, Fengmei, and Gongxi teas from Wuyuan and Tunxi, among other places, were also being purchased in small quantities by 保昌 (Baochang), 協和 (Xiehe), 華茶 (Huacha), 美星 (Meixing) and other firms.

<p>As the weather has been getting colder recently, sales of flannel have become very active. Besides wide and narrow striped and plain camel flannel, leopard-patterned flannel has been selling better than any other type of flannel. Most of it is used for winter coat linings. Therefore, the purchasers are mostly Western-style tailoring businesses, with the客帮 (Ke Bang) trade being more active than the local trade. Among the客帮 (Ke Bang), the markets in Yubei (Chongqing) and northern Shaanxi have the best sales. Yesterday, Tongyi Hui (a merchant association) in the city sold more than 20 bolts in total, with the No. 1 brand priced at 6 yuan and 8 and a half cents, No. 1 brand at 6 yuan and 6 cents, Taihe floral leopard-patterned flannel at 6 yuan and a half, and miscellaneous brand spiral leopard-patterned flannel at 6 yuan and 1 or 2 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Oil Market: Asphalt Shows Fresh Inventory in Zhejiang and Lanxi, Market in Wuhan Turns Lively <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Asphalt is entering its new production season in various places. The Wuhan market, which had a larger amount of old oil, suddenly showed a turnaround, defying expectations. Wuhan is a hub for oil from Jingmen, Yichang, Zhijiang, and Macheng, etc., and the new production seems to be inferior to other places. Generally, because western Hubei is far from Wuhan, and transportation by waterway is subject to delays during the dry season of the Yangtze River's upper reaches in winter, it is unavoidable. Only Macheng oil can be transported by road, but it is feared that it will not arrive in Wuhan until after the Major Snow solar term. Therefore, every year when the new oil in Zhejiang Province is already in full swing, Wuhan is still selling old inventory. Thus, during the transition between old and new inventory, the situation in Wuhan and Shanghai is slightly different. Currently, new goods have been sampled in Zhejiang's eastern areas such as Jinlan. According to the letter from Lanxi a few days ago, merchants have received dozens of pieces of new oil, with a purchase price of 16 yuan per piece. Although the price of the new oil is not yet accurate, the overall trend suggests it will not deviate far. Although western Zhejiang has not reported on the new harvest, it will be within half a month. Shanghai, being close to Zhejiang Province, naturally does not pay much attention to the old oil in Wuhan. Therefore, although the price of Macheng oil in Wuhan has increased from 17 yuan and 7 or 8 cents to 18 yuan and 2 or 3 cents, merchants in Shanghai are not very excited, as their attention is focused on the new goods from Zhejiang Province. However, the price fluctuations in Wuhan affect the overall situation. The Zhejiang province is seeing more brisk sales of old inventories, but it is hoped that the prices will drop too low, making it difficult to approach for the time being, so transactions have not yet been made. It is expected that transactions of new goods will be discovered within ten days. In recent days, the sales price of old oil has not changed. Jingzhou double-layered oil is priced at 22 yuan and slightly more, Pingjing at 21 yuan and 5 or 6 cents, and Suocheng oil at slightly below 20 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e264">Beauty and Choosing a Wife <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Guanghan</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Binfu's "Money and Choosing a Husband" in this publication, I was inspired to write this article ("Beauty and Choosing a Wife," 1) to serve as a counterpart.</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of a husband or wife, many have always ridiculed women for making "money" the main condition for choosing a husband. This is indeed the case, and it is a psychological mistake on the part of women. Little do they know that men, when choosing a wife, also fall into a kind of prejudice, often taking "beauty" as the standard for an "ideal wife."</p>
<p>Understanding the reason why women value "money," there is no doubt that this is because women mostly have a kind of "vanity." To satisfy this vanity, they cannot help but rely on the power of money to achieve their goals. Therefore, their "ideal husband" must be a man with abundant financial resources. As for men choosing women based on "beauty," what is the intention behind this? To say it bluntly, it is nothing more than satisfying their "sexual desire" (in a broad sense). Because a beautiful wife naturally provides her husband with more satisfactory sexual comfort than an ugly wife. Therefore, those seeking a partner all hope to find an angelic companion.</p>
<p>This is where the problem arises. Aren't we saying that women's emphasis on "money" is wrong? Hasn't this mistake been condemned by countless people? What about men's emphasis on "beauty"? Could this be a proper psychology? If not, why is it that so few people have noticed this point, and we have never heard any attacks? What is the reason for this? There is no other reason than that the world is still a male-centered world, so men always have the advantage, and women always suffer.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing a partner, it naturally varies from person to person, and there is no fixed standard. Some value this, and some value that. It is naturally impossible for you to point out who is reasonable and who is unreasonable. However, we must understand that if a man and a woman want to live together in both good times and bad, then both sides' character, knowledge, thoughts, habits, behaviors, and health are all very important and should be taken care of. Money and beauty can only be regarded as one of the many conditions and cannot be used as the main goal of choice. Therefore, women's emphasis on "money" is wrong, and men's emphasis on "beauty" is also wrong. Can we only blame women and forgive men?</p>
<p>The above refers to a proper marriage between a man and a woman. As for some "materialistic" women and "sex-obsessed" men, that's another matter. Because they only know how to satisfy "material desires" and "sexual desires," and everything else is irrelevant. In this situation, women only value "money," and men only value "beauty." Women who have "money" can sacrifice anything, and men who have "beauty" can give up everything. This is very unreasonable. How many men and women in society have been led to destruction by these needs? This is a very painful thing. Therefore, I believe that "vanity" is indeed a woman's weakness, and "beauty worship" is precisely a man's lack of virtue!</p>

<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>Recently, something strange has happened at the second landlord's house. The most obvious thing is that the decorations in the luxurious living room have all been moved to the second young lady's bedroom on the third floor. At the same time, a "Living Room for Rent" sign was posted on the front door. As a result, the mahjong game that used to be noisy all day long, even the one that was often opened in the second young lady's bedroom, has all fallen silent.</p>
<p>Secondly, one day at around noon, in the second young lady's bedroom, the wife was present, and the young lady's husband was also present. At first, they mumbled something indistinctly, then all three fell silent. After a while, the young lady began to cry, and the husband propped his cheeks with both hands, lowered his head dejectedly. As for the wife, she stood there like a wooden chicken, staring blankly.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the wife is always in a panic every day, like a shuttle weaving back and forth on the "zigzag" shaped staircase, climbing from the living room to the third floor, and then climbing down to the kitchen. Moreover, when she passed my room, she was no longer the grim-faced person she used to be, but her face was full of bitter smiles, and she greeted me for no reason. Sometimes, when she saw my socks that had been knocked off the chair and onto the ground by my back, she would immediately enter the room and pick them up for me, saying, "Mr. Kuang, you really work hard, your socks fell on the ground!"</p>
<p>In addition, the second young lady, who used to be so proud and aloof, has also become exceptionally humble. When she passed by on the staircase, she always gave me a flirtatious glance, which made me suspect that she had gone crazy, making my heart flutter strangely. Sometimes, I even wanted to "make a move" on her.</p>
<p>In addition, the wife also had a robust eldest daughter, who lived in the shed on the drying terrace with a group of dirty children. According to the wife, the eldest daughter's life was miserable enough, and her husband's family simply had no food to eat. Therefore, she had no choice but to come here to beg for food. A few days ago, after a big fight, she was driven away by the second young lady.</p>
<p>This situation has lasted for a week, and it is like a mystery to me. I can't figure it out no matter what, and I don't feel comfortable asking. Moreover, I am a guest from out of town, and I have always been lonely. I have never had any contact with the front building, the back building, or the neighbors on the left and right. Suddenly, I don't feel comfortable discussing this sudden strangeness of the second landlord with them.</p>
<p>A mystery is, after all, a mystery.</p>
<p>However, I am confident that this mystery probably has nothing to do with me!</p>
<p>It was late at night, and I was reading Lu Xun's "A Call to Arms," specifically the story of Kong Yiji. When I read the part where Kong Yiji stared at the few remaining fennel beans, shook his head, and recited to the children, "Not much, not much, is it much? Not much." I was laughing so hard that tears were streaming from my eyes. There was a series of urgent knocks on the door outside, followed by the wife entering. The second young lady also twisted her body and appeared in front of my desk. Their exceptional politeness made me feel fearful and uneasy.</p>
<p>"Mr. Kuang, I'm very sorry, I want to discuss something with you..." the wife said, then stopped.</p>
<p>"Sure, what is it?" I readily agreed with her. The second young lady smiled sweetly at the side (obviously a bitter smile). Only then did the wife continue, as if choking:</p>
<p>"Mr. Kuang, you know, our 老閭 (boss, here referring to husband) works on a ship, and he earns quite a bit. But he is getting old and still acting like a fool, throwing money into the pockets of a mistress in Hankou, completely disregarding his own family. The second daughter's husband has also been having difficulties recently, which has resulted in arrears of more than nine months of rent to the big landlord, more than 500 taels. It's really impossible to think about. We have no choice but to temporarily avoid this. We want to deposit a few valuable pieces of furniture in Mr. Kuang's room to avoid being sealed off. We will find a way to take them away in a few days!"</p>
<p>I repeatedly said, "It's originally possible, but..." The nanny outside the door rolled the boxes and cabinets in. The second young lady even said she wanted to move in her brass bed, which cost eighty silver dollars. I was so anxious that I blocked the door, and that was how I stopped her.</p>
<p>That's how my small building became their vault. Seeing how pitiful they were, I really didn't know what to do at the time, and I didn't dare to push them out of the room right away. I just wanted to talk to them in detail tomorrow and think of another way. The landlord's wife was so flustered that she couldn't speak clearly, and just said intermittently: "Please...help...please! The big landlord is coming to check, say it's yours."</p>
<p>When I woke up the next day, I really didn't expect that they had all escaped early in the morning, maybe they had escaped last night.</p>
<p>As a result, the neighborhood has been in a state of commotion until now.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Ying <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Ying is sick, so sick that she doesn't look like a person! Today, I heard the doctor say that she is suffering from consumption. Alas, consumption is a "money disease"! Is Ying, who has no money, worthy of suffering from this disease? She is lying there waiting to die!</p>
<p>Ying, as I look at Ying lying on the deck chair, thin and yellow like dried firewood, she is not yet thirty years old, but her youth has long withered away! No, in her short life, there is no such thing as youth. All she has are heartbreaking and sad memories.</p>
<p>At the age of eighteen, by the order of her parents and the words of a matchmaker, she married Mei Jun. In the first year or two of their marriage, they were still able to live peacefully. But in the last five years, the situation has changed greatly. Mei Jun, a person with no skills who only relied on smooth talk to make a living, should of course be swayed by the waves of the times and become unemployed. However, she, who toiled like a horse and an ox at home all day long, was not only abused by her parents-in-law and given the cold shoulder by her sisters-in-law, but was also unconditionally driven out of the family. The reason was that Ying's fate was too bad, causing her husband to be disabled at home and unable to do business. Although Mei Jun was their only beloved son, and Ying was their beloved daughter-in-law, in the old people who were deeply entrenched in patriarchal concepts, adhering to the ancestral teachings of "raising sons to guard against old age," there was nothing strange about their love for their son and daughter-in-law, who could not bring money to show their filial piety, dropping from a boiling point to a freezing point.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Mei Jun was still an employee at XX Company, and his monthly income was not bad. But "sated with food and warm clothes, one thinks of lust." How could a monthly salary of over a hundred yuan be enough for him to squander at will? For a whole week, or even a whole month, he would not return home, causing Ying to strain her eyes waiting, stretching her neck in vain anticipation. Sometimes, she could not close her eyes all night. On cool nights, she had to sleep alone under the quilt, secretly weeping bitterly to endure the long night. When Mei Jun came home, she still ignored her, but she had to flatter him, because in the psychology of old-fashioned women, they thought that their husband was the only sacred "backbone," so how could they not be diligent towards him? Even a moment of carelessness in speech would result in his punches and kicks, which was very common.</p>
<p>Mei Jun was eventually dismissed by the company's boss for being too promiscuous. Thus, his economic lifeline was undoubtedly cut off. How could he restrain himself from his accustomed extravagance? His eyes also became blind due to his previous excessive indulgence. Thus, he could not move anything and could only sit and wait for death to come. But the god of death was strangely forgiving of him and did not come to catch him. His stomach could not be tied tight, and he still had to eat when he was hungry. Poor Ying, a thin and frail woman like dried firewood, had suffered enough uncompensated torture in her life. At this time, she was implicated in her own fate due to her husband's incompetence and was driven out!</p>
<p>She is sick, so sick that she doesn't look like a person! In a small room the size of a斗 (dou, unit of volume), I look at her disheveled hair, her thin yellow face, her sunken eyes, and her withered hands, and I see a hideous black shadow flashing in this small house.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Writings and Casual Conversation <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Yazhu</p>
<p>The great British philosopher Herbert Spencer only associated with close friends throughout his life, and he would never meet strangers. The reason:</p>
<p>"A person's brilliance 丨丨 the best products produced by the mind, are all in his writings. Only the dregs remain by his side for everyday conversation."</p>
<p>Because a brilliant theory, if explained simply, will not be understood and often leads to misunderstanding or misinterpretation. If explained in detail (usually friends do not gather to lecture and debate as in a school), people find it annoying, impatient, and unwilling to listen to the end. Before you can finish explaining, others may interrupt or take things out of context to argue, or even sneer, making you very angry and upset. Even with close friends, one must be cautious. Therefore, brilliant theories must be written down. The material for writing and conversation must be completely separated:</p>
<p>The brilliant is committed to writing.</p>
<p>The non-brilliant is used for conversation.</p>
<p>The more brilliant the writing, the better.</p>
<p>The more casual the conversation, the better.</p>
<p>In general, young people with more thoughts initially entering the world feel that chatting with others is extremely meaningless. Because they are not allowed to converse with people, or if they do converse, they must talk about important events or theories, thinking that is more meaningful. Unexpectedly, after only saying a word or two, they are misunderstood or annoyed, often unable to clarify, and they are not allowed to explain their true feelings, doing more harm than good, and they are infuriated. Because there is a barrier between people. The more worldly a person is, the more suspicious he is, and they are all very subjective. As soon as you talk about a theory, he does not first care whether your theory is right or wrong, but first guesses the background of your discussion, or suspects that you are flaunting your intelligence, or suspects that you are secretly talking about him. He will then disagree with you. This is also impossible to explain, because he thinks that if it is not about him, why should he start a discussion with him? If they are too young, they cannot discuss anything with you. If they are more knowledgeable and older than you, they want to maintain their dignity, adhere to their own views, and harbor the prejudice that young people cannot have high opinions, leaving no room for discussion. Unless they are close friends, one must be careful even with ordinary casual conversation.</p>
<p>Initially, the purpose of writing was not to express opinions but to gain literary fame. Then, they feel that brilliant theories cannot be talked about with people, and the scope of oral transmission is very narrow, so they must write and publish. At this time, the desire for fame has diminished, and they focus on gaining sympathy for their theories. However, having a name makes it easier for people to believe or value their opinions.</p>
<p>Finally, as their theories become increasingly refined, they cannot be talked about with the few people they are close to. These brilliant products of the mind should not be enjoyed alone, and they can promote the development of the world, so they are unwilling to let them disappear. Like a woman who is pregnant, carrying a fetus for ten months, they cannot help but give birth. Because they cannot avoid engaging in writing and publishing it to the world. At this time, they only have a sense of responsibility and no desire for fame.</p>

<p>— Xin</p>
<p>1.   I attended a banquet held in X 前 a couple days ago. A woman who appeared to be a mannish figure came to our student team in the banquet room. After being introduced by a guest, I also talked to her. I don’t know why, but we needed to ask her to write her address. She said, “I can’t write it.” At first, we thought she was being polite. Later, we found out that she really didn’t know how to write. At the time, we were surprised to learn that she was illiterate, but also a very modern lady with short hair. After she left, a group of students who were eager to find out about everything heard the following from another female guest, “She is 24 years old this year, and she divorced her husband two years ago. Because she didn’t have the ability to support herself, she joined the dance hall and became a variant of economic independence. She is currently wandering at a crossroads between a dancehall and acting. She is an unofficial dancer and celebrity.”</p>
<p>Ah! Women can be found everywhere now! This is something to celebrate. After the women's rights movement was popular for a while, we see that it has achieved some success. But in general, there are always things to regret. The word “flower vase” is an attractive noun awarded to company clerks whose monthly allowance is just enough to buy make-up. Their economic independence is great, but people say they engage in some kind of business.</p>
<p>Dance halls were established for people’s entertainment and places for women to sell their bodies with their touching meat and graceful attire. Who can deny that? Let’s talk about the latest trend of movies that most people recognize as an educational tool. Given that it is highly regarded by everyone, the movie industry has a big responsibility to educate the public. If an illiterate woman, like the female guest mentioned earlier, were to act in a movie, what practical education could they get from these actors? Other than their charming, alluring eyes, crimson lips, big breasts, and fleshy thighs… other than the sensual and seductive ways to enchant their audience, we can’t talk about any kind of artistic meaning. People are either thoughtlessly cheering or want to promote their products, so they take advantage of the actresses and make extravagant ads. Ah! They should be more conscious. Although they can earn a lot of money every day, they become parasites and the cause of the current chaos and unrest! At best, it is a variant of economic independence, because we should understand the important responsibilities we have. We should be using our talents to earn the appropriate amount of payment.</p>

<p>— Person</p>
<p>Basket took the No. 9 public bus to Avenue Foch. On such a long journey, I sat with someone with nothing to do, so I took out a book and started reading it intentionally or unintentionally. A large group of passengers got on, and a large group got off. I didn't notice anything until a foreign ticket inspector came to check my ticket. Then I realized it was the ticket inspector. A strange drama thus began:</p>
<p>On the side of the bus where the driver was, on one of the seats, sat a middle-aged man, holding some kind of bottle in his hand. All the other passengers on the bus had already bought their tickets. Only he was still clutching the coins tightly in his palm. When the ticket inspector came to check his ticket, he asked, "How much is it to XX Road?" The foreign ticket inspector took the coins, smiled sarcastically, went to the ticket seller to exchange for a ticket, and then handed it to him. He then wrote something silently in a notebook, without saying a word. (Because he was considered to be trying to "mooch" from the ticket buyer). Silently standing in the bus, listening to the ticket seller and the man with the bottle arguing. "You troublemaker, sitting silently in the corner. You son of a bitch, trying to mooch, causing others to be fined, you shameless thing," the ticket seller cursed fiercely.</p>
<p>"You are a shameless little dog thing, trying to mooch yourself, why don't you just sell tickets, and still scold others, be careful!" The other party also turned pale and retorted defiantly, holding on to his self-righteous grounds.</p>
<p>"Careful of what? Sitting here silently like a ghost, why did everyone else buy a ticket except you?"</p>
<p>"It's obvious you want to mooch!"</p>
<p>"I really don't want to mooch, the money from mooching will be used for scraping therapy. A shameless troublemaker like you should by rights have to pay the full thirty-four cents, who knows where you crawled out from..."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The foreign ticket inspector stood there quietly, as if understanding or not, his two eyeballs hidden in the yellow hair, shining brightly as he gazed at them. A thin gentleman sitting next to me, wearing a black long gown and a tilted felt hat, opened his mouth to comment: "We are not in the know, but you two yourselves know what's going on in your hearts. But you are mooching from the foreigners, why are you arguing so seriously? We are all Chinese, making fools of ourselves in front of foreigners because of the foreigners' affairs, how embarrassing is that!" (To the ticket seller:) "Can't you tell the difference? Why do you start cursing people as soon as you open your mouth? That's not right of you!"...</p>
<p>The destination arrived. The thin gentleman's strange argument had not yet reached a conclusion. I had no choice but to jump off the bus, regretting that I didn't have the good fortune to hear the end, and took a deep breath.</p>

<p>(Enemy shells land in the battlefield, smoke fills the air, dust flies everywhere. Our army sets up machine guns, fixes bayonets, and waits in full battle array. Lightning flashes, illuminating the extremely tense faces of everyone. Afterwards, the sound of a charge is faintly heard in the distance. Shouts of killing from far to near.

<h3 id="e272">The Secrets to Finding Work in Hollywood (Part 1) <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Dao</p>
<p>Kim Harlow's Experience: The First Key is Patience</p>
<p>You often see unknown names suddenly enter the Hollywood film industry and become famous overnight. Of course, you are very envious. But you can't find a way in; every time you write to those stars or film companies, asking them how to become an actor, you never get a reply. It's not that they are indifferent to your questions. Many of them, before entering the film industry, often asked the same question. They may really want to help you and tell you some secrets; but this is such a complex problem! Even if they wanted to tell you, they wouldn't have the energy. Where would they find the time?</p>
<p>Of course, Hollywood is full of people seeking work. Being able to get a job as an extra is already considered lucky; and to become a regular actor is indeed extremely difficult. But don't be discouraged. Opportunities are not non-existent, as long as you know how to enter the film industry. This doesn't mean going through back doors or seeking help from powerful people, but relying on your own efforts.</p>
<p>The question is very simple: "How can I get into the film industry?" But the answer is too complex. You need to know how to do makeup, how to read scripts, how to train your voice, how to practice your posture, how to correct unnatural and ungraceful aspects of your posture, and how to use gestures. You also need to know how much money to bring when you first come to Hollywood, how to live while waiting for opportunities, and so on. Of course, a star who doesn't know you can't possibly tell you all of this.</p>
<p>Now, that's great. A big star is willing to share her good experiences with you. She also climbed out of hardships and difficulties, so of course her words are very helpful to those who want to enter the film industry but have no way in. She is the famous blonde Kim Harlow. The following is her opinion:</p>
<p>"The first fundamental condition is that those who want to enter the film industry must first have the ability to cultivate themselves and fight against disappointment. Hollywood is an unpredictable and illusory place. Unless you have this steadfast and unyielding heart and indomitable ambition, you shouldn't come here. Because here, everything is uncertain. Today you get an opportunity that you think is guaranteed, but tomorrow it's snatched away by someone else."</p>
<p>"Any woman who wants to come to Hollywood to seek work should bring her own money to spend, and don't calculate in advance how much money she can earn in Hollywood. She should at least bring enough money to spend for a year. She must be able to afford her own fashionable clothes. This way, she will be financially independent and will have more opportunities. The cost of living in Hollywood is not very high. Rent and food are not too expensive. Clothes are the same all year round. A smart and calculating woman can get by in Hollywood for a year with one thousand two hundred U.S. dollars; if she can sacrifice some personal pleasures, she can even save some money."</p>
<p>"If you don't have a strong physique, you don't need to enter the film industry, because once you enter the film industry, the heavy workload can make you hunch over; even when you have nothing to do, that kind of unstable life can make it difficult for you to support yourself. So now the actresses in the film industry, if they are determined to move up, they dare not indulge in pleasure, they avoid alcohol and sex as if they were avoiding the plague, because the human body is not made of iron and stone, "burning a candle at both ends" is the most harmful. There is also one thing, a base reputation is the most undesirable. If you have a base reputation; you will lose good opportunities. When you come to Hollywood, you should cherish your reputation more than you do in your hometown." (To be continued)</p>

<p>Originally, film criticism has become a formula. First, comment on the story, then add a review of the technique. Of course, for the convenience of writing, this is okay. But criticizing every film in this way is really too meaningless.</p>
<p>However, this film "Strangers Return" is first of all worthy of attention for its "story".</p>
<p>The "story" narrates "Old man Dole, prolific and ill, surrounded by his poor and greedy relatives, waiting for the old man to die so they can seize his fertile land. At this time, the old man's granddaughter Louise happens to return from the city. The old man spends his days wandering the fields. The girl meets the young man Clay and they fall in love. But Clay is a married man. The old man's relatives try their best to attack the girl, causing her to leave the old man; the old man is provoked and becomes mentally disturbed. The relatives think of secretly harming him, but the girl calms him down. His mind is clearer, and he writes his will and gives it to the girl before dying. And finally, Clay says goodbye to the girl and leaves his hometown to make a living in the city, because he doesn't want to burden the girl with love, and both sides move towards a bright future!"</p>
<p>We know that a "theme" becomes a theme after passing through the writer's consciousness, and there is a writer's creative method in action in between. Therefore, the writer's choice of subject matter, or the emphasis on a certain part of the subject matter, is the practice of the writer's creative method. The writer's views are determined by life. Therefore, old writers cannot easily see the reality of society, but excellent writers sometimes do see it. "Professor Tovey" is an excellent example. Now, although the central idea of this "Strangers Return" cannot escape from sympathizing with the old man with fertile land and hating the "petty" thinking of the "poor and greedy" relatives. But he is unable to deeply expose the internal nature of the property system, but in the end he has been able to jump out of the American film's happy ending of marriage between men and women, and make the two parties go their separate ways, which cannot be said to be progress.</p>
<p>"Strangers Return" is directed by King Vidor. Although King Vidor is not as familiar to the Chinese audience as Cecil B. DeMille and Ernst Lubitsch, he is not as unfamiliar as Pabst and Ingram, and his skills are as far above Lubitsch and others as Pabst and Ingram are. Like this "Strangers Return", he is able to use the literary description techniques of "Fleur-de-Lis" and "Madame Bovary" to narrate this "ordinary" (what naturalistic writers call "ordinary") story. Because there are no very dazzling plots in the story, like ordinary American films, the director also maintains a calm tone throughout. Even in scenes like the old man's death, he only makes the colors deep and not stimulating, which I think is very commendable.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are shortcomings, such as the lack of detailed expression of Clay's free and easy personality, so the final decisive action feels sudden.</p>
<p>As for the actors, Lionel Barrymore is very good, surpassing his other works, which may be due to the director's strength. Miriam Hopkins works hard.</p>
<p>The shots are also very good, especially the beauty of the outdoor scenes, of course, it is just the beauty sung by pastoral poets!</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3 id="e274">I Also Want to Review "Spring Tide" <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Qin</p>
<p>"Spring Tide" has been playing for a long time; I saw this film on the second day of its premiere. Originally, I wanted to write a review after seeing it, but I thought: this review is selling well, there are certain critics with special boxes, and besides, it's already the second day, so there's no hope of being quick, and if I send it in carelessly, I'll just be sending in a free ticket. But unexpectedly, there are still endless reviews in the newspaper now, and there are also a few reviewers whose names are unfamiliar. So I couldn't help but feel itchy, and wrote the following:</p>
<p>(1) Meaning: It is just a narrative of the sad romance of two infatuated men and women. Such a plain and boring story is something that we who have greater desires don't need to know. Even the song that Yu Ying groans when she is dying! "Sweet dreams, come back!" cannot win the tears of sympathy from the audience.</p>
<p>(2) Sound recording: It has the problem of incoherence. For example, when walking, in one environment, the leather shoes sometimes rustle, and sometimes there is no sound. In the ship, since it is a sound film, there is no sound of the ship's mechanical movement; In addition, the sound is blurred. Although I concentrate and listen quietly, I still can't understand what he is saying; but in other times, there are a few scenes that are unexpectedly clear; This new domestic sound film, this point makes me happy.</p>
<p>(3) Scenery; It's generally good, but it's inevitable that it's sometimes unrealistic.</p>
<p>(4) Actors; Gao Zhanfei performed very powerfully in the second half, but his expression at the beginning was lacking and a little dull. Wang Renmei's liveliness is her true color, but her sad expression in the second half is not very satisfactory. This is because the director did not carefully examine the distribution of characters. Li Li's portrayal of the harlot is so natural when she first appears on the screen, which is very rare. Yuan Congmei is still good, full of gentlemanly spirit, and the rest of the supporting roles are also competent.</p>
<p>(5) Cinematography; Several hours are very mature, only the opening scenes are vague.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Questions About "Small Toys" <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Lianxiong</p>
<p>Yesterday I accidentally picked up the newspaper and saw such a large advertisement: it turned out that "Small Toys" was being re-screened at the Beijing Grand Theatre. I went to see it, and carefully chewed over the film I had just seen, and couldn't help but have the following questions; they are described below:</p>
<p>(1) When Yuan Pu and the wealthy woman were talking in the toy factory, it really made me confused and inexplicably baffled; when did Yuan Pu return to China? When did he open the toy factory? Although there are the words "only seven months after returning to China" in the subtitles, it does not explain the situation when he returned to China, and the ins and outs of opening the toy factory.</p>
<p>(2) Yuan Pu and the wealthy woman's acquaintance is also unclear.</p>
<p>(3) Who exactly is A Yong? How did he meet Zhu'er? How did he gradually become Zhu'er's lover? These are not adequately told to me on the screen either.</p>
<p>(4) When Aunt Ye heard the mantis dealer's story: After the news of her husband Lao Ye's sudden death, she immediately led her children 丨丨 Zhu'er and Yu'er to the place where Lao Ye died, in full view of the public, everyone saw that Yu'er was brought by her, so how could no one care when the kidnapper took Yu'er away? This also seems too unreasonable.</p>

<h3 id="e276">National Films Need to Emphasize Individual Performance <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Yi</p>
<p>Pearl S. Buck, the author of "The Good Earth," once said: "We are all different, and whoever admits these differences and develops them as much as possible is wise."</p>
<p>From this we can know that if a person can develop his own unique differences, that is, his personality, to the greatest extent, his future has unlimited hope.</p>
<p>Let's look at foreign actors, they can all develop their unique personalities. They all have their special styles. For example, Emil Jannings, Adolphe Menjou, Chevalier, Chaplin, all of these people's works show their own unique differences. If their films were to be starred by someone else, and they tried to imitate the original star's actions as much as possible, I think the product would definitely not be as profound or moving as the original.</p>
<p>So I say that individual performance is easy to move the audience and give them a deep impression. If you only talk about imitating others, at best, you only imitate nine points; your success at most cannot be as successful as that person. Because that person is creative, and you are only imitating.</p>
<p>Are you saying that Marlene Dietrich is imitating Garbo? That's really a wrong idea. Marlene Dietrich's performance really has her own unique and strong personality, and she is even smarter than Garbo. I dare say that if she had completely imitated Garbo, she would not have achieved today's fame.</p>
<p>The unique differences of several comedic stars are even more obvious. The differences between Rock, Chaplin, and Buster Keaton are obvious, and I don't need to say more. If their performances were mutually plagiarized, then what value would we have?</p>
<p>Our country's film revival movement in recent years has created several products with some value. However, the content and performance often lack the development of personality and are instead imitating foreign products. This is really a bad phenomenon. For example, the situation when two people meet, the situation of parting, the situation of crying and laughing, and the situation of walking, are all often imitating imports. This makes the content of the work lack fullness. If I want to see your work that is being imitated as much as possible, I won't readily go directly to see the original product!</p>
<p>I don't want our country's stars to become Eastern Colmans, Eastern Laurel and Hardys, Eastern Clara Bows. I hope our silver screen produces more actors who emphasize personality, and hope that they can become world stars.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Five Hundred Professionals Elect Movie Actresses Joan Crawford Receives the Most Votes <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Lian</p>
<p>The American film magazine Screen play recently asked five hundred professionals to select an ideal woman from among the actresses.</p>
<p>These professionals included bankers, lawyers, doctors, journalists, and store clerks. They most welcomed Joan Crawford, Mae West, Jean Harlow, Ruby Keeler, Katharine Hepburn, Norma Shearer, and Ginger Rogers. The woman they idealize is a beautiful, moving, modern, and highly educated woman. They don't like someone as strong as Babe Didrickson, last year's Olympic all-around female track and field athlete, but they don't love skinny, sickly beauties either. They like women with feminine beauty, but they hope they are good companions.</p>
<p>Out of the five hundred people, everyone except one said that their ideal woman must have a good education, and all of them demanded that she must have a sense of humor. Few people describe their ideal woman as someone who can't swim, dance, play tennis, or golf. They want her to know a little about sports.</p>
<p>Half of the people said that she could smoke and drink, but not too much. Few people want his ideal character to be a social butterfly, but she should occupy a position in society.</p>

<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Because Hollywood stars are afraid of being too fat and damaging their appearance, they have to find ways to exercise and make themselves thinner. But now a new dog hospital has opened in Hollywood, and its special department is for treating dog obesity. It is said that if a dog is too fat, it will be bulky and not agile, which is unsightly; and it will lose exercise and easily get sick. If this kind of dog is sent to the hospital, it can lose weight and increase health without fasting. It is said that since the hospital opened, business has been very prosperous.</p>

<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>Laurel Renaud pondered... She was so beautifully dressed, so affectionate, so young... She was only nineteen, and he himself was nearly forty... Time passed so quickly that his rapid thoughts couldn't keep up. He did love her, no one had ever loved her like that. He had experienced too many women; he had been in love with women more than a hundred times. He had been married three times... To be honest, that third one still hasn't been properly divorced. How could Schiller love him again, that would only make her sad. He shouldn't repeat the mistakes of his life. Moreover, since he really loved her, he couldn't let her hurt himself again. He decided to awaken her fantasy to avoid a greater tragedy. He tried every means to tell her, but what was her answer? It was "I love you, Laurel; no matter what, I love you."</p>
<p>"You are young and inexperienced 丨" he held her jade hand and told her earnestly, "I'm all burned out. I only ask you to listen to me this time for the mistakes of my life." But before Laurel could finish speaking, Wheeler's lips were already pressed to his lips. Not letting him go on. She said, "I won't listen to you. I love you. No matter what you say, it's useless. I'm going to tell my parents 丨 and Ennis 丨 I'm going to tell them tonight." Laurel jumped up and shouted, "No 丨 you must not do that!"</p>
<p>The door creaked, telling them that a guest was coming. "That's Max," Laurel said, and went to open the door. Max was Laurel Renaud's agent. He must have brought good news, Laurel felt very excited; or a new contract to restore him to his former position in the film industry. Those fickle audiences, he must let them see that he hasn't finished yet! Schiller stared at him, expressing rebellion and deep love, and walked away silently.</p>
<p>Another rebellious gaze was directed at Packard, but without deep love. She said loudly: "You must go to the Jordans' banquet with me. I want to wear my new clothes too." Packard gasped and said, "No, no, I'm not going. Don't you remember what I told you last week?" Mrs. Packard said; "I don't remember! I can't remember what you said a minute ago!" Packard said: "Fool, didn't I tell you that I wanted to take over Jordan's company? Haha, that big fool is now delivering himself to my door, and he doesn't even know it! One day he invited me to his office. He later agreed to copy a list of his company's shareholders and give it to me. Once I get that list, I can follow the map and buy as much as I need. From now on, haha, Packard will be the owner of the best shipping company from here to the tropics. Mrs. Jordan will never know." Kitty Packard said: "I don't care about those things. I'm going to that banquet. My new clothes will make their eyes pop out!" (To be continued)</p>
