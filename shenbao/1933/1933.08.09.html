<p>罷工潮蔓延全國發生流血</p>
<p>總統民心不歸附猶圖戀棧</p>
<p>古巴內變竟召致美國干涉</p>
<p>哈伐那　此問事變、今日更形劇烈、民衆聞總統馬嘉度辭職之訊、聚集道中、鼓舞歡呼、秘密警察於淸道之際、開來福槍擊斃約十五人、一時人心大震、旋軍隊奉總統命令開入、佔據全城、助同警察維持治安、總統因各處紛告罷工、稱之爲與已爲敵之消極革命、故特於今日下令實施軍</p>
<p>治、現火車交通已失常狀、內地因發生嚴重之暴動、加以電報工人之罷工、故與京中不能通電、駐古巴美大使韋爾斯承認調解之企圖已陷僵局、因自由黨拒絶討論减短總統之任欺有也、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>古巴京　古巴島上總罷工情形、愈益蔓延、顯具政治意味、所有運輸事務、工商兩業郵電及公共工程、皆已加入罷工、國會定於午後開會討論停止憲法上保障問題、此案若被通過、恐致引起嚴重事故、果爾、則一切調停運動、將受重大影響矣、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）　官塲雖傳古巴總統馬嘉度不致辭職之說、但衆料其將下野而避居國外、紐約時報謂古巴現狀將迫令美國加以干涉、美國海陸軍在六個月前早已擬妥干涉計畫、但聞羅斯福總統反對美國干涉古巴事件、哈伐那警察向街中民衆開槍、死傷之數、傳說不一、死者或謂二十、或謂九十、傷者約二百人、聞被捕者達數百人、羣衆輕信無線電所傳總統業已辭職之不確報告、欣喜欲狂、集於總統府外、手舞足蹈、表示欣幸、不意駐於總統府屋頂及其他要處之兵警遽放機關槍、向下轟擊、傷者紛紛避入美使署、人數甚衆、故使署已變爲醫院、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>古巴京城　古巴罷工初尙以爲出於馬嘉度總統之唆使、冀以威脅駐古巴美國大使威爾斯、現知並非如是、蓋罷工已及於全國、且以驅逐馬嘉度總統爲目的、據最近消息、罷工由各工人團體所發動、且有學生爲之援助、罷工發展極速、强暴行爲層見迭出、使美大使威爾斯之調停益形困難、美國國務院方面不問罷工之原因如何、已决定須遇絶對必要時、方派軍艦前往、蓋國務院猶冀威爾斯大使之調停可有成功之望也、昨日羅斯福總統在海德公園竟日與威爾斯大使通電話、願任調停、威使向羅斯福總統之報告、謂祇有馬嘉度總統辭職、足以解决古巴時局、否則難使古巴不陷於無政府之狀態、美國政界人士頗贊成威使之意見、華盛頓方面見古巴高級軍官數百人之不願參加鎭壓罷工、感受深刻之剌激、此間以爲於兩三日內時局當可見分曉、希望馬嘉度去後、繼任者將爲加洛斯上校、加氏反對馬氏最力、曾一度入獄、現避居美國云、</p>
<p>（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>哈伐那　古巴革命潮愈演愈烈、警家旣無力制止京內之紛擾、軍隊又有不穏消息、馬嘉度總統已於今夜赴京外别墅、考慮美大使韋爾士提出之下野提議、韋氏提議馬嘉度總統與現任國務卿佛拉拉俱立即辭職·另任新國務卿暫行代理總統職權、此項解决方式、在古巴政府與革命黨兩方面、當然皆信其曾得總統羅斯福之贊成、否則美大使當亦不致貿然提出、即中立國方面亦認此爲馬嘉度總統保全尊榮而下野之唯一辦法、且聞美大使提出此議於政府與革黨代表時雙方俱覺滿意、惟馬嘉度則因得國會擁護通過議案、准其停止一切憲法保障、宣布戒嚴、並授以調動軍隊鎭壓工潮之權、猶欲作最後之掙扎、曾於今夜在别墅用無線電向全國播音、請人民共起救護古巴主權、勸罷工者立即復工、其倡言救護主權之意、蓋表示美人干涉之可慮、企圖轉移罷工者之憤怒、變爲一致對外也、此外並在哈伐那施行嚴厲戒嚴令、特派軍隊一千餘人維護秩序、同時在喀麥圭地方亦宣布戒嚴、至該地暴動聞業已平息、死亡數人、革黨方面則稱、國會之通過議案、出於暴力之脅迫、並非眞心擁護、倘政府調遣軍隊彈壓罷工者、無異欲用軍隊以對付全國人民、因目下無人不停止工作也、故若軍隊一動、即將發生公開與嚴重之叛亂、目下各政黨皆認時局非常嚴重、苟不迅速解决、將有召致美國行動之虞、美總統方密切注意古巴時局、雖决意避免類似干涉之行動、但亦深憂最近之發展、彼固在原則上反對干涉、但亦痛惡流血者也、目下暴行日多、今日此間有罷工工人及表同情者千餘人在某大公園集會、警察驅逐不散、乃開放機關槍、但仍力求避免傷害羣衆、故傷者僅數人死者二人、據官塲報告、自發生罷工潮以來、全國死傷尙不多、共死七人、傷十八人、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）　現奥林特省內仍有武裝革命軍塔爾角附近亦然、但尙無集中隊伍向京城進發之象、故各方皆認苟警察亦加入罷工後、革命目的即可達到、現警察署官員多有爲馬嘉度總統秘密偵探指爲不執行政府命令、不加審問即行槍斃者、</p>
<p>此間美僑以爲馬嘉度如被迫下野、而美國預聞此事亦未嘗不可增進古巴人民對於美國之感情、祗須今後不加干涉可矣外間常認美國實業界爲馬嘉度總統之後盾、即馬氏之當選亦出美實業界之力、蓋美國實業界與古巴關係極爲密切、勢難不過問古巴之政治、逆料美國之糖業電氣業及銀行業、對於古巴之推選臨時總統或永久總統、均將預聞者也、至目下推翻政府之運動、實由於賦稅過重、目下每人平均負担四十五元、在經濟繁榮時尙不覺苦、一至經濟衰落遂有不勝負担之勢、不覺怨望四起而革命隨之云、（八日國民電）</p>

<p>航空署長徐培根發展空軍之談話。曾見五日本報。其中注重訓練民間都市防空一節。已預定於十六個月後在南京舉行第一次民間防空大演習。再十二個月後。在上海舉行第二次。第三次則在天津舉行揣其用意似欲於三年以內。完成吾國易受空襲各地之空防布置。蓋距今三年後。正世界軍事家認爲第二次大戰將爆發之一九三六年也。</p>
<p>都市防空之演習有軍事當局辦之事項。有人民方面應作之準備。防空司令部之設置。以及防空司令官任務所需條件之完成。爲軍事當局應辦之事項。普及空戰之知識。養成敏捷有秩序之習慣。則人民所應作之準備也。前者非本文所欲言。請就後者略述之。</p>
<p>空戰之可畏。在其受禍之慘烈。及敵機來臨之迅速。閘北之瓦礫尙存。空軍威力吾人應已認識。至其來往之速。則新式飛機每小時飛行之速率。爲一百八十至二百四十公里。每秒鐘平均速度。約六十餘公尺。（合舊二百尺）舉例言之。上海吳淞間十六公里之距離。只五分鐘之飛程耳。使市民無空防之訓練。則報警之聲未息。敵機已至。爆烈彈立下。慘禍臨頭矣。故通常都市防空。必於距防衛中心一百二三十公里之地。以偵察機爲防空監視哨。庶都市一聞警告。防禦之空軍。可以飛出應敵。市民可立即熄滅燈火。停止種種動作以避敵機之目標。防空司令部亦可爲對遮蔽之工作。或於曠地僞裝敵機所欲得之標的。以耗費其轟炸力。</p>
<p>無論防空當局遮蔽工事辦理之迅緩。防空軍應敵作戰之如何。遭受空襲之都市住民。至遲應於聞警後二十分鐘內。完畢其避難行動。此種避難行動。包括（一）依燈火管理之條例。立即熄滅全市燈火。（二）迅捷潛入豫先指定之地穴。（三）停止一切恐爲敵機窺見之動作。甚至不使全市發見陰影。煙氣。砂塵。都市防空之演習間。空防警察之職務。尤爲重要。一大羣紛擾恐慌之市民。欲其於煞時之間。有秩序的迅捷完畢其一切空防規律下應作之事。非有良好之指揮與監督。殊非易易。中國人民。一遇急難。喚女呼兒。爲習慣之事。爭先恐後。爲常見之行。凡此皆遭受敵機空襲時所必不應有。非派大隊有訓練之空防警察。分區出勤。恐漏舟爭座之事。必不能免。</p>
<p>上海於去年一二八戰事中。已飽受日機襲擊之敎訓。然年餘以來。吾人僅見東京空防演習之新聞。而自身不獲於巨大犧牲之後。親受空戰避難之訓練。今於航空署長發表舉行防空演習時期之機會。稍述所知。深望國內軍事專家。能於增進人民防空知識上。多所盡力也。</p>

<p>充實海陸軍力量對付美國與蘇聯</p>
<p>關東一帶重要都市演習空中防衛</p>
<p>大家都知道、日本人也自命是同英格蘭三島一樣的海國、可是英國歷來都保持着牠海國的面目、因爲牠發達得早、所以全世界未開闢的土地、豐富的天產、差不多都爲大英帝國所占領、所開發、所以牠的殖民地遍世界、牠在軍事上的特長不用講是集其全力於海軍、日本則恰恰相反、牠雖是個海國、牠却集中全部的注意力於大陸、牠兩次對外大戰↓淸日戰爭與日俄戰爭、其决勝都是在於陸軍的决戰、所以牠從前、在山縣有朋的時代以前、海軍是受參謀本部指揮的、換一句話說、就是陸軍閥領導海軍閥、到山縣將死的時候、海軍司令部纔脫離參謀本部的指揮而獨立、</p>
<p>直到最近、日本帝國主義侵略的先鋒還是陸軍、譬如說挑動九一八瀋陽事變的是陸軍、奪取東三省地盤的還是陸軍、挑動上海事變的雖是海軍、但結果還是抽調了四個師團有奇的陸軍、纔爭回了牠的顏面、至於侵佔熱河、攻掠津東、不用講完全靠陸軍了、就一方面看、日本的陸軍可以說是盛極一時、無往不利、所以牠在國內眞算是天之驕子、再加在鄉軍人會的鼓吹、牠自已可說是打盡天下無敵手了、然而牠所找到的敵人、是號稱兵多而没有近代武器設備的中國、其實牠的勝利僅祗是高一個階段的武器銳利的勝利、並不是什麽精神上的勝利、牠這種武器也只能比中國好一點、如果要與大陸軍國的法蘭西牠們相較、那眞是小巫見大巫了、即是和新興的蘇聯相比較、牠自已也覺着不如、第一是近代的機械化兵團、通日本陸軍全體只有兩個聯隊、而蘇聯的機械化師團竟有四個、第二是飛機、全日本陸海軍所有不過一千二百架、合民間一百五十架、也還不到一千五百架、而蘇聯要比牠多四倍、美國比牠多八倍、在海軍方面、日本也很覺得自以爲滿足了、因爲就海軍噸位數字上講、除英美而外算牠第一、攻取檀香山雖嫌不足、保持東海Ｉ西太平洋上的交通、却是有餘了何况牠還有牠防守攻擊的特長呢、在海軍方面、牠第一個長處是潛行艦艇、年齡新銳、設備週全、續航力遠大、攻擊力强、非但美國望塵莫及、即海上稱王的英國也瞠乎其後、第二是重輕兩種巡洋艦、隻數雖比美國少、而速率備砲的射程都比美國高、所以牠的陸海軍都足以適合於對美和對蘇之用、</p>
<p>不過牠現時主要的缺點、如上面所說的、</p>
<p>除了機械化兵團之外、（因爲機械化兵團只能運用於陸地、然則僅限於在東三省或蒙古的戰塲上、對蘇聯戰爭時纔用得着、其他的用處就很少了）牠還有一個大缺點、就是航空隊、因爲航空隊可以由海上的航空母艦出發、可以用　島作根據、還可以由山東半島或由上海附近等等地方作基凖、去攻擊日本的主要城市、所以日本軍部對於外來的空襲非常警戒、特别是近來飛渡大洋的舉動完全成功之後、牠更警戒得厲害、牠設想到、假如外國的飛機來襲擊、日本應當怎樣辦呢、因此、牠極力注重空防、特别是在東京·大阪·京都·神户·等主要都市、皆努力建設防空設備、在高射砲·聽音機·等積極防衛之外、還有烟幕·交通整理·燈火管理·防毒·救護·等消極的防衛、本月二十日在關東一帶重要都市豫行防空演習、用十二架飛機編成三隊、當作敵機、飛來東京擲放炸彈毒瓦斯、防衛方面、以東京警察廳內設立了防衛司令部、前第一師團長林仙之作了演習的警備司令官、民間的靑年團、都一齊出動來輔助各種消極的防衛、當午後一時、即接到空襲的危險警報、警衛師團與第一師團遂全體動員、佈滿各重要處所、當然陸軍省內充滿了戰時氣味、附近陸軍部一帶、施放濃密的烟幕、而防毒班·消防隊·都一齊整裝待命、總之一切都是戰時的樣子、而燈火的管理尤其是促進民間緊張的惟一剌激劑、由以上的演習、我們可以窺知日本備戰的積極、和對防空的重視、（一九三三·七廿八·於東京）</p>

<p>國際與中日事件最近之發展</p>
<p>前出席國聯大會專門委員·現任國民政府行政院參事梁鋆立博士、應上海國際問題研究會之請、於昨日（八日）下午五時、在該會演講最近在日內瓦所得之印象、茲誌其演辭如左、</p>
<p>予去年在美演講中日問題之國際政治上及法律上的意義、十月間、我國代表、以李頓報告書、將於十一月間舉行之特别大會提出討論、國際形勢、日見緊張、東省各種問題、有需法律上之間明者甚夥、特電美邀予前往日內瓦襄助、予於十一月中抵日內瓦、其時國聯行政院方預備開始集會、各國人士、對於國際問題、饒有興趣者、羣往日內瓦作壁上觀、蓋自凡爾塞和會以來、國際政治之引起專門學者及一般羣衆之注意、無有甚於此次者、是不獨因國聯自已之生命、能繼續延其殘喘與否、將視東省事件之解决以爲斷、抑且大戰以來、普及世界之和平及非戰運動、其有否相當之意義與繼續之必要、胥視日人是否能受世界輿論之制裁、以爲試金石也、就予個人而觀、東省事件、在輿論方面所得熱烈之注意、較諸在各國政府方面所得者、相差奚啻倍蓰、蓋多國政府（特别是所謂「大國」之政府）對於東省事件、因彼等自已實利上尙未因此受劇烈之損害、大都有息事寗人·大事化爲小事·小事化爲無事的心理、英外交部長西門氏·法外部長彭古氏、所發表之言論、均認東省事件爲地方事件、與世界一般政治、無直接關係、但此乃彼等對外之·辭、實則彼等鈞心鬥角、設法免除日本責任之企圖、無時或已、西門氏一方在裁軍會議堅持德國應遵守國聯盟約中關於軍縮之規定、一方開脫日本破壞盟約之舉動、其政策之顯然矛盾、爲人所共覩、但西門氏爲掩飾其矛盾起見、乃大倡日本在華之軍事行動非國際法上所稱「戰爭」之說、其實國際法學家對於此點之觀念、現已丕然一變、西門氏所主張者、不過一面之詞、其背後有純粹政治上之理由、而爲新派法學家所不取者、列强方面、對於東省事件態度之冷淡、始終未變、今春雖由特别大會通過十九委員會之報告書、但國聯此種非難日本之斷然處置、與其謂爲英法諸大國態度之轉變、毋寗謂爲世界輿論壓迫之結果、蓋在英在法尤其在美、凡是研究國際問題之機關如我國之國際問題研究會者、對於國聯之無能、均抱十分惋惜、其中且有切實表示、如國聯理論上及道德上之制裁、亦畏葸不敢加諸日本者、彼等將停止對於國聯之擁護、例如英國之國聯恊會·（私人團體）美國之外交政策研究會·（亦爲私人團體）對於日本之破壞盟約、皆有切實之表示、此爲國際政治上一淸明之現象、可與吾人以慰情聊勝之樂觀者、</p>
<p>我國代表團在日內瓦活動之成績、一載以來、隨時披露於報端、此處可不復贅、本年二月大會通過十九委員會報告之後、日內瓦空氣、自緊張一變而爲沈悶、其中雖有裁軍會議之集會、但就中日事件而觀、國聯效用、彷彿至此而止、近聞大會設立之「諮詢委員會」、關於不承認「滿洲國」之報告、業已發表、日前各報、均有登載、但此一報告、非殿以國聯盟約第十六條所規定之經濟制裁、定無我們希望之效果、除「不承認」之原則、僅在消極方面、稍有力量外、對於制止侵略、毫無補助、并且時過境遷、各列强狃於私利、卽此原則、恐亦不能恪守、日來日本又有出寇華北之消息、際此軍事緊張之時期、僅僅從事於消極原則之規定、殊屬近於滑稽也、</p>
<p>予個人觀點、始終主張我國應在適當之時期、提出國聯盟約第十六條、說者以爲欲提出此條、我國非宣戰或絶交不可、予則以爲由純粹法理而觀、此二條件、並非必要、蓋第十六條所制止者、爲「戰爭行爲」而非「戰爭狀態」國際法學家中有作「行爲」與「狀態」之劃分者、予以爲近代國際法根本觀念、趨重於動的方面、在乎各種行爲的控制、而不在乎抽象邏輯的一貫、盟約所制止者、爲實戰爭行爲、而非傳習國際法所承認之戰爭狀態也、予對此問題、屢有論列、回國途中、曾爲申報月刋八月號撰著一文、亦經指出一般人對於此點之誤解、可詳按也、</p>
<p>最近國聯因東省事件辦理之軟弱、乃轉其注意與我國從事技術上之合作、此未始非「失之東榆收之桑榆」、蓋國聯之機能、本分爲二部、一爲制止戰爭、一爲促進合作、前者較難、而後者較易、但倘使在後者有卓著之成效、國聯的存在、卽有相當之理由、吾人對於國際機關、不可希望大奢、吾人之政策、應竭盡此等機會之效用、各國對於國聯、均有相當之注重、在日內瓦辦外交、并非弱國卽絶無成功之機會、一九二四及二五年、德國之勢、衰頽已極、但因外交部長斯屈來斯曼、在日內瓦手段敵活、目光遠大之故、德國於一九二六年、卽被邀加入國聯、其國際地位、亦有一日千里之勢、現今各重要國家、均有資望甚高之外交家、常川駐在日內瓦、予意我國苟欲繼續日內瓦外交者、應選擇有世界眼光國際政治專門知識者、常川駐於該處、以與英法諸代表相周旋、前伍梯雲先生任代表時、對此曾三致意也、予意國際問題研究會宜設法與英美諸國同一目的之機關相聯絡、以達到切實左右國際輿論之目標、美國上議院議員波拉有言、欲政府行爲有效、輿論必施以不時之鞭撻、國際機關、有不滿人意之處、吾人亦不憚加以鞭撻、使知所警戒、予滋望國際問題研究會、能蕃用其鞭撻也、</p>

<p>據談或謂大會須改期至明年春　間舉行、此項主張純係私人之　意見、蓋本屆運動會之决定、在　十月十日舉行、因（一）此次全運　會係繼續辦理二十年之全運會、根據以前之决議在國慶日舉行、（二）秋季天時較春季爲佳、蓋夏冬兩季固非運動時季、而春季則雨水甚多、晴雨無定、運動會旣不能中途停頓、運動亦頗感不便、因天時關係、全運會以秋季爲最宜、（三）本會自籌備以來、其重要工作、大致支配就緒、祇待分頭進行、卽可如期開會、若遽爾停頓、不特時間不經濟、卽經費之損失、亦不可計矣、因以上種種原因、本屆全運會决不能改期、</p>

<p>下午四時在中華網球塲舉行</p>
<p>鄭兆佳昨以直落三勝馬安權</p>
<p>中華公開網球單打比賽、開賽至今、已達决賽週中、鄭兆佳與王文正、定今日下午四時在中華網球場决賽、以定錦標之誰屬、昨日鄭兆佳對馬安權之複賽、鄭以六比三、六比二、六比二勝馬、今日鄭王之决賽、自上海華人有正式單打錦標賽會以來、此爲第一次最有精彩之比賽、（按邱飛海林寳華俱未參加中華單打錦標賽、故歷年競爭興趣、均不濃厚、本年鄭王之戰、實最爲精彩、足以嫓美林寳華與邱飛海）</p>
<h3 id="c223">昨日複賽 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>昨日鄭兆佳對馬安權之複賽、鄭以直落勝、可謂十分容易、略述經過如下、</p>
<p>▲第一盤　開始後鄭用低急之抽球猛攻、使馬安權招架爲難、連失三局、馬力自振作、奪回二局、旋成四比三、鄭以六比三勝、</p>
<p>▲第二盤　起首各勝一局、鄭又連加三局、成四比一、而後各加一局、成六比二勝、是局中鄭屢次上網、得失互見、</p>
<p>▲第三盤　鄭擊出之球、力道愈足、使馬安權難於招架、鄭連得四局、下局鄭因自殺而失去一局、後又各加一局、鄭卒以六比二再勝、</p>
<h3 id="c224">今日决賽 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>▲已往戰績　鄭兆佳在此項比賽中、初賽輪空、次賽以六比二、六比二、九比七勝毛鴻發、半複賽三比六、六比二、六比二、六比三勝李南、複賽則以六比三、六比二、六比二勝馬安權、王文正初賽亦輪定、次賽對手鄭自榮因臂傷棄權、半複賽、三比六、六比一、六比三、六比一、勝孫麟方、複賽六比三、六比四、六比○勝余田光、觀二人成績、殊見平均、</p>
<p>▲二人資格　王文正之出身、正和法國網球名將柯顯同、自幼卽充網球場拾球童子、由拾球進而爲Ｍerker、在網球場上之生活、已有二十年左右之歷史、耳濡目染、及自身之習練、其經騐之多、資格之老、全國可稱第一、今年得恢復業餘資格、作其初次參加正式錦標比賽、實有極大希望、球藝之熟、足與邱飛海嫓美、門路則不及邱君耳、至於鄭兆佳、爲我國少年界之傑出人材、經騐資格、雖不及王文正、但其技能已靑出於藍、歷次出席重要錦標比賽、足與林邱嫓美、</p>
<p>▲决賽情形　王以球熟而少自殺著稱、鄭則以勁道及門路見長、今日之决賽、其盛况當不亞於昔日邱林之戰、觀衆之評論、有謂鄭兆佳可勝者、有謂王文正可勝者議論紛紜、莫衷一是、因以引起網球界對此次决賽懷着極大興趣與希望、實足以表演網球界之新興氣象、今日之戰、希望二人盡顯固有特長、作極精彩之表演以賞觀衆、則勝固可喜、敗亦有榮焉、</p>

<h3 id="c228">贈本屆留學生 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 君惕</p>
<p>一年一度的留學時期，又到眼前。我們對於留學生，抱了無窮的希望，在他們將離祖國，而適異邦，去求最新的科學，來復興中華的時候，我不得不學古人寫幾句臨别贈言。聽不聽由他，寫不寫由我。我國漢時，只有外國人來中土留學；到了唐朝，纔有到外國留學的人。！誰都知道就是上西天取經的唐僧陳玄裝。·他在交　不便的時代，不畏山川險阻，到印度研究佛典。還國後，與其弟子翻譯佛經七十五部，佛氏最高哲學，纔由他介紹到中國來，而中國原有的哲學，受了不少的影響。這是第一個成功的！</p>
<p>第二個，明末上海人徐光啟，他雖未到過外國，却是從外國人研究天算，與留學的目的一樣。他的師傳，就是天主堂掛的那穿着明朝官服的意大利人利瑪寳先生。除去天算之外，他還研究火器。譯書甚多。中國人學西洋學術的，恐怕自徐先生始，我看過一本英文上海志，上面有他一幅像，穿着明朝官服，（並未穿西裝，端立中央，旁邊桌上放着地球儀，和他的著作，這種精神，就不可及。這是第二個成功的！</p>
<p>第三個，淸末閩侯人嚴復，英國留學生，譯書甚多，以原富，天演論，穆勒名學，爲最著。可惜空懷了一肚子學問，淸廷不能重用，賜進士出身，便是他留學的結局；　見得他的同學，日本伊籐博文，把日本改造得日新月異。但是他在政治上雖未得到位置！而在學術界裏，却放一異采。也算是第三個成功的！</p>
<p>以上三位，他們學成之後，所作的書，就是譯書。他們不用原文來敎人，而將原文譯成國文來敎人，從此可知用原文與本國文之是非了。我當然不敢說，現在留學生，没有比得上他們三位的學問；也不敢說，現在留學生没有比得上他們三位的著作。但是以數十年來留學生的數目做比例，那所出的人才，可就太少，而不能滿足我們的希望！說也慚愧，日本維新五十年，外國有一本重要的書籍，他們有一本譯本；外國出一本新書，幾個月內，就見到日本文的譯本。我們中國也維新了幾十年，而大學用書，是用原文的，譜解也用原文，這不把中國當作無文字的國家嗎？我也問過幾位敎授，是何道理？他們說：「無良好的課本」或是「較爲便利」，（便利自已，便利不了人，）甚而至說「非用原文不能了解」這話只好認爲下氣通。但是，如何使有良好翻譯的課本，或創作的課本，及如何使不便利而便利，是誰應該負起這責任來？這是要請留學諸公特别注意！</p>
<p>如若不然，我們只要請大批的外國人來敎書，也就完了：何必親勞玉趾，遠涉重洋，去販些原料回來，而不能變爲製造物哩？</p>
<h3 id="c229">旅店的淸晨 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>

<p>，在熹微的晨光裏睡着，昨夜的歌聲，　影，燈紅，酒緑：：：無疑地已是沈默着再等待夜之來臨。</p>
<p>在另一間房子裏，也許還是做他們的好夢Ｉ甜蜜的好夢，嫌淸晨之無情。</p>
<p>一般蠢動詭謀的名利者，半夜已經醒來，却守候着今朝的淸晨，實施他預擬的計劃。</p>
<p>等在門口的黃包車夫，他們不管「夜」或是「淸晨」，祗有冀求乘客比昨日多，以維持他的生命</p>

<p>一筆鉅大的奬金，正好像舊小說上所載公主抛下的招親彩毬。它在空中滴溜溜的轉下，着在誰個幸運兒身上，平地一聲雷，得嬌妻；做駙馬；榮華富貴，式式俱全。一個人得了奬金，數目小一些，可以換换季；　　跳舞塲，眼前快樂逍遙。數目大一些，洋房，汽車，漂亮的姬妾，一古腦兒都可以派用塲。</p>
<p>「讀讀讀！書中自有黃金屋。讀讀讀！書中自有顏如玉和千鍾粟。」這幾句話在這二十世紀摩登時代，眞是不合時宜。讀了書，準有餓死的份兒，没有發財的希望，惟有購買奬劵，祖宗陰功積德；幸運之神，跟在你屁股後頭。一開彩便是頭奬，幾十萬白花花的兩子領到。娶了一個「顏如玉」；築了一座「黃金屋」；高興化了錢去運動一個「千鍾粟，爲人一世，豈不式式如願了麽？買買買！劵中自有黃金屋。買買買！劵中自有顏如玉。買買買！劵中自有千鍾粟。再說得小一些，抽香烟也有奬金，牌子隨你去揀選大的頭奬有伍千元；末尾也有一條香烟。喝啤酒也有奬了；買花標布也有奬了；此外蚊蟲香，肥皂，購書，逛逛游藝塲，：：：竟是不勝枚舉。上海遍地是奬金，誰額角亮；誰運道好，花的鈔票：白的洋錢，便會飛到你袋裏來。</p>
<p>各項的賣買，除了棺材舖，醫院，人肉市塲，還没有發行奬劵外，此外的都有設立奬金的可能性。萬一說不定，棺材舖老　見了眼紅；醫院和人肉市塲爲了兜攬生意，也來發行一下。一定死人接二連三；醫院高掛客滿牌；一塊塊人肉壓成了人乾，羣來領受這一筆奬金。　今年是國貨年，國貨未見暢銷，不如定他爲奬金年。奬劵滿天飛；奬金滿地滾，全國的民衆，努力來奪取這許多的奬金。</p>

<p>承家得來者健兒狂歡</p>
<p>這倒是可以容納王士立的話，可以多和一兩個人商量一下，便是不幹，也不急在一兩天。這樣一個　怠的念頭，把當日急於要改行的主張，差不多取消一半了。這天過去了。到了次日十二點鐘的時候，弟兄們午睡了，趙自强閑着無事，走出了營門，也到曠野的地方去走走，借此也好想想心事。出了西苑不遠，便是到萬壽山去的一條御街。由街上經過，那酒飯館裏，刀勺亂響，接着一陣陣的油香味，向鼻子裏鑽了進去，把人家的食慾，就不知不覺的跟了香味走，伸手挑開一家酒館臨街的棉布簾子，走了進去。一個伙計迎上來笑道，趙連長，短見，好久不照顧我們了。趙自强笑道，兩個月没發餉，照顧你們什麽？吃了東西，可以不給錢嗎？伙計笑道：趙連長眞是好人，今天發了餉，今天就來照</p>
<p>顧我們了。趙自强笑道：你眞會說話。不說我没錢也肯賒給我吃，倒說是我今天來吃，就是發了餉。我倒要問你，怎麽就知道我今天發了餉？伙計笑道：有位關連長，您也認識吧？他自已說的，每逢發餉，就要到這裏來喝幾鐘。他今天天來了，我想一定是發了餉。趙自强在路口一副座位上坐下，兩手互相搓着，笑道：你把我們改透了，（註：即挖苦更進一層之意。）我們不發餉，就不能吃小館子嗎？這句話伙計没有答復，後面雅座裏有人笑着代答了起來道：這話是一點兒也不假。說着話，那人一掀門簾子出來，正是關耀武。趙自强笑道：果然你在這兒喝上了，你一個人發了餉嗎？關耀武道：一年苦到頭，淸淡的日子過得久了，不問發餉不發餉，我總得舒服一下。來來來！咱們一塊兒喝幾鍾。說時，拉着趙自强就向雅座裏走。（一五三）</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>火傘般的太陽，也知道逼　得人們太厲害了，很乖巧地向西山背後：隠藏一回。住在鴿籠式內的人們。一見那暴日歸去，欣欣地揮着蒲扇；扱着拖鞋，聚在街頭納凉。舒散他們一天的鬱蒸，領略那夜的凉快，風的吹送。</p>
<p>水門汀的人行道上；衖堂的靠邊，藤椅·矮凳，坐滿了男男女女。男的大都裸着上身；褲脚管　到腿灣上。女的穿着薄薄的紗衫，曲線呈現；赤着雙足，玉腿很公開地陳列着。誰說中國不在提倡裸體運動，那納凉的所在，便是一半裸着體。</p>
<p>東家的寗波嫂子，高談着昨晚做了白馬的亂夢，很命地打他一注花會，却開出了黑狗。唉聲嘆氣，說是張九官老猢猻在作弄伊。蘇州嫂子嬌聲的講那麻將經，適纔和出一付帶花四翻的牌，贏了好幾塊大洋。年輕的男女，在談着大光明電影院的佈置；「白姊妹」一片的不能大團圓，很是乏趣。許多小孩子，蹲在地上，指手劃脚，演講金羅漢一把飛劍，砍去了惡覇的頭顱。還有穿靑布衫的苦工，數說着釘棚間裏的小毛子，幾多的有情有義。這一幕露天的會議，眞是聲容並茂；百戲紛陳。</p>
<p>漸漸的夜深了，納凉的人們稍稍感覺着疲乏。遠遠的送來一陳胡琴聲；跟着逼尖着喉嚨，一陣不自然的歌聲：「姐在那房中呀：正月裏來是新春：：「做着廣告的唱着。好事的人喊住了他，呌他唱着。也會哼幾齣非驢非馬的京腔；也會唱新式的毛毛雨，妹妹我愛你；也會唱舊式的四季相思，十八摸。唱了一會，各人掏出了幾個銅子，拚凑給那獻藝給民衆的藝術家。胡琴聲，歌聲，漸漸的遠了：人們也感覺着疲乏了，有的橫躺在露天；有的回屋去和臭蟲奮鬥，和熱悶抵抗。</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>新任駐外七公使中，只有兩人在國內，其餘五人均在海外，最近，這兩人都訂期放洋，分往比葡兩國履新，駐比的是前中央大學校長張乃燕，駐葡的的是中央大學老敎授張歆海，說是老敎授，意思卽是說其資格老，遠在東大時代，卽爲西洋文學系各敎授，談到年齡這兩位張公使，却都在四十歲以下，不能算老。說到儀容更都是英俊沉着，精神奕奕，不愧爲新中國駐外的公使。毫無老氣橫秋的風采，總之，凡屬外交官儀容所應有的特點，他們都不缺少。</p>
<p>駐葡萄牙張公使，今春蕭伯訥到滬時，曾臨時爲梅蘭芳作舌人，雄辯滔滔，爲海上人士所注目，在外交部任參事多年，且一度代長歐美司；惟以性情剛毅，與人不易圓融，不知將來遠涉重詳後，能否使其本性得以改變？在國內很少見他發表文章；但在海外，尤其是美國的有各雜誌，却常常可以讀到他的大作。一個在外國很知名的作家，在國內却幾於没没無關；這事很有意義呀！</p>
<p>駐比利時張公使，原是攻化學的，（陰丹司林顏色洗不去，就是他發明的；）然而回國以來，却以寫「世界大戰全史」，在著作界獲得相當聲譽。接着商務印書館爲他發行芸廬歷史叢書，文采華美，取材謹嚴，不是組製濫造的著作所可同日而語。他的相貎，有人說頗似顏惠慶，可不知顏大使也是「一個和氣」見人「滿面春風嗎？須知此張公使與人無忤，不若彼張公使難與人圓融啊。</p>
<p>駐葡張公使聲言要研究中葡外交全史，因爲葡萄牙與我通商早，歷史當然較長，很値得詳細研究了。駐比張公使，想係對歷史研究有素，所以聲言對比利時將作一橫的考察。張静江是他的阿叔，已爲其設法由建設委員會撥一兩萬給他作考察費了。</p>
<h3 id="c234">民國三詩僧 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 柳圃</p>
<p>僧以詩鳴，而且富有卓越的藝術天才的，在民國以來，可有三位：（一）是曼殊（二）是敬安（三）是弘一。</p>
<p>曼殊本姓蘇，是一個有着豐富的「天禀的機智」的人，做出一手好詩文，留給後人悲感同情，眞是互千萬世不磨滅的。尤其近年經柳亞子與瘦鵑諸先生一番　幽發微的表揚之後，更引起了靑年們的注意；凡是受了時代的浪濤的襲擊，而沾染着無可奈何的情緒的人們，没有不愛讀他的詩文。因爲曼殊的詩文，正能表現人們所不易表現的情思，能說出人們所不能說，而爲人人所能體騐的美感的話，卽是所謂「掻着癢處。」所以他的悱惻纏綿，哀感淸亮的詩句，常是人們的最好的慰藉品。</p>
<p>其次，敬安卽是寄禪和尙，他精研內典，也工吟詠，著有」八指頭陀集」行世。他的內行敦篤，所以詩詞也十分冷雋，不作綺語，偶一爲之，也屬異數，以前曾見他的一首：「維摩居士太猖狂，天女何來散妙香，自笑禪心如枯木，花枝相伴也無妨。」是比較有趣的，怕也是一時卽興之作罷？敬安圓寂於民元，時適奔往舊都，爲保持寺院，進行向當局請願，不料抵京未浹旬，卽物化。</p>
<p>至於弘一法師，原姓李，名叔同。他曾經擔任過報社筆政，學校敎師，精繪事，工詩文，蜚聲藝苑，也是當世有數妙手。但他晚年却棄學耽禪，遁入空門，刻苦修行，律已彌嚴。</p>

<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>甲喜歡吃甜：乙喜歡吃鹹。</p>
<p>因爲喜歡吃甜，甲就說甜怎樣好吃。吃了怎樣有益，吃起來又多麽風雅，或者雄壯；還有也喜歡吃甜的别人就附和甲的學理，或者主義，或者意識，於是成爲甲派。乙以同樣的理由成爲乙派。</p>
<p>當道的主義只好有一個，於是甲想打倒乙，乙也想打到甲：於是論戰開始。這是甜派與鹹派都認自已的主義該當道的論戰。</p>
<p>還有一種論戰，其中的一派並不認自已的主義該當道，而且還認該當道的是别一派的主義，正如那派自認一樣。</p>
<p>這樣說來就不該有論戰了不是？可是有。</p>
<p>甲派喜歡吃甜，可是自已覺得吃甜是一個錯誤，實應該吃鹹。於是他們提出一個吃甜兼吃鹹，或者吃甜不忘鹹的主義來，雖然也許他們並不喜歡吃鹹，或者，甚至，不能吃鹹。可是他們不能不那樣也提出它，因爲他們是看淸整，或者以爲看淸楚，鹹派的主義是會當道的。</p>
<p>可是鹹派看到了那主義有些不解，因爲旣然知道該吃鹹，爲什麽不實行吃鹹？爲什麽還要提出那種甜鹹調和的主義來？於是鹹派製論駁斥，於是甜派製論答辯。於是論戰又開始。</p>
<p>看到了那次的甜派，或者甜鹹調和派的失敗，知趣的，識時務的，吃甜的人都一致地說吃甜是要不得的，是公子哥兒的習氣，吃鹹的才是英雄，是豪傑。因爲他以爲甜寗可背了人偷偷地去吃。落筆就非擁護鹹不可。</p>
<p>於是滿天下的文章無非是鹹的擁護論，而甜與鹹的論戰就此告了一個永遠的結束。</p>

<p>— 余敏</p>
<p>廣告上說，「前復旦大學敎授陳望道先生評：開明國語課本書畫文字都精美調和，字裏行間含有豐富的暗示力，關於書法課的考察及注音符號的處置，更見苦心。」</p>
<p>開明的國語課本是葉紹鈞先生編的，</p>
<p>的確有些特色，但是也還有『缺點。』　陳望道先生說起注音符號，我們倒可以在這課本裏發見國語讀音上的錯誤。第八册第三課裏寫着『馬托車。』從上下文看來，這一定是汽車，Ｍotor車，然而『馬』字照『國語』讀却是ＩＹ的上聲，</p>
<p>不是ＬＨ。如果照敎育部去年公布的國音常用字彙的注音符號第二式（羅馬字）的拚法，那末，『馬托車』就變成了Ｍaetuoche、無論中西南北的人都不會懂得這是什麽東西。要說這『馬』字應當照南邊口音罷，那整部課本的京音，又都是註的『標準國語』的讀音。</p>
<p>再則，很可惜的，這課本裏竟會有文法上的錯誤。第四册第二六課；『牆上開朶小紅花，牆下蝸牛去看花：無數花開朶朶紅，一齊笑臉歡迎他。』白話文法習慣，似乎『開朶』是『開着一朶』的意思；何以下文又變了『無數花』呢？這些，都還是偶然的『失檢，』容易改正的。</p>
<p>說到『暗示力，』第八册上却有一課『窮人和富翁』（第五課），這是這樣一個故事：</p>
<p>窮人問富翁『富足』的方法。富翁說：『我這裏什麽東西都是偷來的。』於是窮人就去大偷特偷，結果自然給人捉住了；三年之後他從監獄裏出來，就駡富翁『壞東西，我上了你的當。』富翁的回答很妙：『我偷自然的東西，不偷人家的東西：我種田，耕地，鑿石，伐木：這許多不都是自然的東西嗎？我偷了來，誰也没有話說，至於人家辛辛苦苦得來的東西，只該由人家去受用，怎麽能偷他們的？』</p>
<p>我想這後面必須補充一課，說窮人聽了這話，就眞的去『種田，耕地，鑿石，伐木：』但是半空中跳出了地主等類</p>
<p>的人，要他交租，向他算賬．他又上一次當．他再去請敎那富翁的時候，富翁會告訴他：『我是耕種我自已的田地，誰敎你自已没有地等等的呢！』富翁心上明白：致富的方法在於使别人來替自已勞動．但是這是秘訣．說穿不得的．是的，必須『補充』這麽一課，否則，窮人會上葉先生的當．</p>
<p>自由談上說起過小學課本的具體批評的必要。我這不過隨便寫幾句，算不得批評，也許是讀廣告後的一點感想罷了；而且我還是承認葉先生的課本比較的已經算好的了。</p>

<p>— 唐張</p>
<p>人們到了不如意的時候，下意識地會想起他所親的人，所愛的事物來。沙漠的旅行者渴望著水草，海行的人渴望著陸原，同樣地，在旅邸凄淸，百無聊籟的當兒，會想起故鄉，生起懷鄉病來。　我從十二歲上離開家鄉，到現在快近十年了。這其間飽經憂患，差　童心還没有改去，有時依舊要講幾句獃頭獃腦，而爲「正人君子」們所不能了解的傻話。</p>
<p>晚近幾年，週遭所接觸的社會漸漸大起來；陰險暴戾的印象剌得我胸口作痛！我並没有畏縮和後退的心，我準備好血肉的軀幹，來承受時代的艱渠！但每當午夜夢回，想起故園的一切，我迷懂了！這是懷鄉病。</p>
<p>豈明老人說他對於故鄉的情分，是因爲「釣於斯游於斯」的關係。在故鄉雖然也有許多事使我依戀，但我可没有「不如歸去，科頭箕踞，高枕看山色」的念頭。我的所以生懷鄉病，實在有些和李蓴客貂裘換酒寫京邸被酒的心情差不多。他的詞是；</p>
<p>「作計吾歸矣！算長安衣冠物望，如斯而已。擾擾一羣烏白頸，妄語便爲名士。祗君輩姓名難記“但覺逢人都不識，更天涯何處尋知已？我與我，週旋耳。此間無地堪沈醉。便當年虎賁騶卒，至今餘幾？柴棘胸中三斗許，觸處即生芒剌；總事事不如人意。　灌無文隋陸武，要何如銅雀臺前支。誰健者，　公喜？</p>
<p>逆境固然可以處　，　力也還可以抵抗，　有白頸鳥的　　郤令人艱受！雷公老爺打妖怪，打到糞坑裏，終也不能不掩鼻而走吧！</p>
<p>至於說逢人都不　，那更是事實。都市裏所有的，全是些陌生的人；舉動，言語，行爲，全不是我所能了解的。他們笑，笑我所並不以爲可笑的事情；他們駡，駡我所並不以爲可駡的人。要是把住著時代的是他們，那末，我是背著時代在跑。</p>
<p>我倦於看這種醜類了。我需要眞純樸質的鄉村生活，來調節我的口味，洗去我滿身的腥羶！</p>
<p>我生著懷鄉病。</p>

<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>（五）第二天早上，之光在九點鐘光景已經被伯唐放了車子接他到格利格拉脫路來了；雖然他從阿明口裏，祇曉得伯唐昨夜没有看見雍孫，但是他早已料到伯唐連雍孫的消息都没有探聽到。果然他走上西頭石階正預備去開過道西端的門，却看見伯唐帶着滿腔不自在的神情，從南面走廊跑過來和他說話：</p>
<p>「昨天晚上我到三點鐘才回來」！</p>
<p>「消息呢？」</p>
<p>「那裏會有消息！」</p>
<p>「那麽現在怎樣打算？」</p>
<p>「我打算先把今天三點鐘要做的事和要派的人，都商量妥當，一面等候文卿的回音再來動作：：我們到裏面去談罷：：剛才文卿有電話來，他已經到了行裏，先問了這邊的消息。」他們坐在飯堂裏了，不久，偑英和叔晋也都進來，後來伯唐又請了兩三個住在家裏的親友同來參預。開始，議論是很龐雜的，因而主張也很不一致，甚或竟有人主張趕緊去找吳鑒光測字圓光，也有人主張趕緊去找暗探之流在法租界西區去尋雍孫的車子，末了，伯唐把雍孫那些素有較密往來的親友住址理成一單，又和之光偑萸接洽了好多時，才定了這樣一個兩橛的辦法；第一橛，立刻派人分途到單內各親友家裏，說是家中有要緊的事發生，倘若他們看見了雍孫，務請勸他立時回來，或者立的卽用電話通告；第二橛，倘若杳無消息，而文卿又無能爲力，那末就得派人分段守住文卿所說的那兩條馬路，去截住雍孫的汽車。</p>
<p>辦法雖然具體化了，但是派出去的人選却很爲難，尤其是第二橛所需要的，旣得多又得能幹。伯唐和之光，都得留在家裏預備對付一切，偑萸更其不能走開，所以叔晋和施五哥之流，就分開坐了幾部黃色汽車，遵照第一橛的辦法，立時出發，至於那第二橛，經過了許久的推敲，才决定把文卿所說的兩條馬路分做兩個警備區，選了長興的管賬俞成章和跑街俞廣章兩人，各司一區的警備任務；並且呌他們先行相度地勢各選一個公共塲所做接頭的機關，呌他們先在廠裏再在廠外各選二三十個聰明能幹的人，只候接到出發的命令，就從午後兩點鐘起輪班在兩區各處交义路口梭巡，專心截住雍孫的車子；萬一毫無結果，也須得到斷絶交通的時候才能撤防。於是伯唐就呌人去找兩俞了。這時候他才記到廠裡的事，嘆了一口長氣說道；</p>

<h3 id="c268">談智識分子的出路 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 白孹</p>
<p>到處碰壁，從那裏去找出路呢？「曕望前途，不寒而憟！」</p>
<p>這是失業了好久，白費了心血，空過了時光，剌激深深，生活依然無着的智識分子的悲鳴。</p>
<p>因爲智識「過剩」，所以智識分子無處「銷售」他的智識，於是大批智識分子便失業了，在失業的浪潮裏，智識分子是到處碰了壁。</p>
<p>「那裏是智識分子的出路呢？」這是現時嚴重的一個問題，我以爲最先要打破他們的「學問萬能」「品格高尙」的傅統思想，而且要改轅易轍地從體力勞動或生產工作上去着手進行，男的不妨去當「茶房」之類，女的不妨去當「娘姨」之類。但在「市場日窄」的現狀下，我也懷疑着我的方法之是否有效！</p>
<p>「那麽智識分子的出路究竟在那裏呢？」我又想到一般「無智識」的亡命徒，他們早已是失業者，他們早已經歷着現時智識分子所經歷的厄運，當他們生活恐慌的時候，他們的出路是「偷些」「搶些「！據說他們不過是去「偷還來」「搶還來」而已！但在「現社會的秩序下，我又不敢敎智識分子去做」「喪人格」「犯罪　的勾當！</p>
<p>於是，過剩的智識分子在現社會裏終於是「没有出路」了！週遭雖激響着他們的「悲鳴」，但「悲鳴」有什麽用呢！</p>

<p>三小姐從半踝着的手腕上的珠鐲中抽出一條五彩的絲帕，香氣送進開車阿三的鼻官，車身微微振盪了一下，並不轉灣，直向静安寺路駛去。三小姐輕輕地拭去從四七一一中灣出來汗珠，笑着對同伴說話，那小巧的塗滿了口紅的櫻唇，映進阿三額前的小鏡子中，車身微微振盪了一下，並不轉灣，直向静安寺路駛去。</p>
<p>蜜司朱用小指將滾在前面的頭髮，推到後面去，她感到疲乏。在汽車節凑的狂馳中，她不願意多說話。幻想那個穿淺灰色洋服的像梅蘭芳一般的臉，在校裏好幾次會見過的，好像是阿媚的Ｓweetheaat::;;</p>
<p>一羣明星送進後．鐵門已被拉上，没有擠上的駡着娘祖宗一類的話．蜜司朱隨着喝彩聲返過頭去，梅蘭芳的臉幾乎凑上她的；三小姐的視線投在胡蝶姑娘的兩個笑渦上，没有留意到這暮喜劇．蜜司朱促緊了一雙剔去後重繪出來的眉毛，梅蘭芳倒退了二步，她忍不住的歡微一笑，梅蘭芳像被人搶去那好地位似的又擠緊她背後。</p>
<p>蜜司朱感到炙手的熱力，從他的寬闊的胸膛傳來。人羣在旋轉，胡蝶，艾霞，獅子狗的毛，白的臉，紅的唇，騒動，喝彩。她再没有情緒去瞧，有意的無意的挨緊他的寬闊的胸膛，他的鼻息微微拂着　邊的亂髮，她感到需要有力的有力的擁抱，像人猿泰山那樣：：：　汽車停在新世界前的紅光中，三小姐敲着玻璃對阿三說：「兜一個圈子」！蜜司朱紅着臉，像做了惡夢一般的驚醒，阿三純熟的旋動車輪，向緑光中駛去：蜜司朱的臉仍是紅紅的晚霞一樣。。</p>
<p>熱鬧的市區都掉在汽車後面，身後陡的向前飛，一股熱力從皮墊中湧上，蜜司朱重跌進甜蜜的回憶。</p>
<p>她憤怒男子太不了解女子的心，太没有勇氣，女子須得保重矜持的尊嚴，面孔滿漂亮的，不知道這種暗示嗎：她斜着眼回過頭去，他僅是無表情的微笑。她佯裝跥脚，踏上他的，他又膽怯的退後了：：</p>
<p>汽車在狂馳，蜜司朱晚霞的臉上罩上一層怒霜。</p>
<p>三小姐注視着大包小包的衣料，自已身上的旗袍胸前已染上上點油漬，那三包應敢自已做的。零料部檢來的二塊給媽，省那老太婆說女孩子大了不顧娘。一匹印度綢小徐要的，他老開我條斧，三小姐自已笑了，她計畫着多餘的紡綢給爸，預備要錢的藉口。啊！阿菊，她想起了阿菊，那小丫頭的嘴没有藥吃要七說八說的，身上旗袍送給她吧。</p>
<p>三小姐安閒的笑着，小徐那强有力的手腕在她面前誘惑。</p>
<p>蜜司朱晚霞的臉上罩上一層怒霜。汽車在狂馳，阿三瞧着手表，九點鐘要到三江旅館去。</p>

<p>— 祥雲</p>
<p>『老王！皮漏？』福福在忙亂的翻倒</p>
<p>篋中，實然意識到遠遠地傳來汽車停駛時的異樣聲調：按連，又時一陳皮鞋躂躂聲。就停止工作，而聳起耳朶，嚴重地放低聲帶說。</p>
<p>『是！』</p>
<p>王小四子精明地朝向窗外一望，看見好些人影，分開來在凄凉的路燈下，混結着飄搖的樹蔭在移動。他就一壁說，一壁把手上的東西往衣袋裏一塞，並把插在腰身上的那支六寸白郎林抽出來，拉開保險，而緊緊地放在手掌中。　在静寂的世界裏，躂躂的皮鞋聲。在零落地逐漸嚮亮起來。</p>
<p>『福福！』負責監視屋主人的李得勝，偷偷地放低脚踏聲，在樓梯口出現。他緊張地說，『出皮漏，大家下來！』李得勝把詞一說，就翻轉手走下去。福福順勢把電燈一扭，也就跟着王小四子從黑暗中，溜下樓梯去。在樓底下，小麻子跟阿二守住關閉了的後門，他們一壁拏緊盒子砲，一壁對下樓梯來的人，放射他們那亮晶晶的眼光。反映在慘淡的隠顯着的手電光裏的他們那靑紫色的險龐上，表現着給恐怖的危難之境遇中。所造成的一種堅决的犧牲的情感。他們都把牙跟咬的緊緊。他們的渾身都像給剌人骨體的冷風所侵襲般在戰慄　『上！』王小四子把腦袋朝向大家一轉說。他的嘴巴在頽動。</p>
<p>『是！』</p>
<p>「上一上再講！」</p>
<p>黑暗中，王小四子看見他們都把頭黠了一點，</p>
<p>「格樣子“：死，阿二，小麻子有傢</p>
<p>伙的先衝上去，福福搭老李在後頭。」　碰地一聲，王小四子跟住開列了來的門跳出去，接連他就對準隠伏在前頭的壁角裏，牆蔭下的黑影放起槍來。在後頭，阿二，小麻子也跳了出來。他們都把身體緊靠着牆壁前進。他們儘量把身體埋藏在黑暗裏。他們都在殘忍地放射子彈。而劈拍劈拍的嚮聲，和像狂風的呼嘯般子彈在室間裏所發出的聲音也籠罩着他們。他們着了彈，淋着血，但他們却依然在掙扎，在前進，放快脚步在走。</p>
<p>經了這陳的喧擾，這陳子彈的橫飛底狂嘯，住在附近的居民也都顫慄着陷於恐怖的迷惑裏。但一下子，一切又都沉默起來。樹影依然静寂地漏着燈光在柏油路上擺動，靑風敲動着樹葉發出凉的呻吟，而深深地感動着人們的心靈。</p>

<p>是四年前的事。</p>
<p>超明和影林爲了同學友好想更進一層做義兄弟，當然呀，這是一件極平凡的小事，不見得什麽希罕。</p>
<p>爲了要效法劉關張的桃園三結義，覺得二人結義有些不像，於是急忙找！位要好同學雨章來補缺。</p>
<p>「有福同享，有難同當」；金蘭譜上顯明地印着八個紅字，照過相，喝過酒，算是手續已經辦妥，以年齡計算，雨章做大哥，影林做二哥，超明做三弟。以後去，像是大家很友睦，快樂過日。</p>
<p>逐漸，發現了二哥有些怕羞，過事不肯講實話。</p>
<p>「二哥，老實些，現在我們多是自已人了」：三弟肚裏藏不住話。每次不自禁地要勸告他。</p>
<p>「哦：：」二哥老是這般腔調。</p>
<p>「：：：」大哥默聲不響。</p>
<p>天幸，二哥逐漸把怕羞脾氣减了一大半。</p>
<p>二哥是走讀，大哥和三弟寄宿在校裏，接觸時間較多。</p>
<p>一天，三弟在校中操塲上學騎自由車，因爲是初次，東倒西歪的踏不穏，一個心慌，車子碰着了别人身上。</p>
<p>「對不起，他是初學不當心」，大哥以互相精神抱歉似地向對方伸說幾句算解了圍。</p>
<p>「倒底還是我肯帮你忙，不然，哼哼：：恐怕要受累呢！」大哥事後驕倣地自詡，嘴邊掛着一絲得意的微笑。</p>
<p>「這又値得大驚小怪，誰奇罕」：三弟終於熬不住了。</p>
<p>四年多在這般大家不肯互相了解中</p>
<p>捱過了，繼續來臨的是他們高中三年級畢業的最後一學期。</p>
<p>大哥和三弟間的感情愈加顯現着破裂，！一個是驕慢，一個是剛實，同水火相尅般永世彌補不好，但是，爲了條約！金蘭譜！的東縛，祗得讓苦痛擊襲到各人的心頭，誰也没有勇氣先提議隔絶關係，至於二哥呢，不過性陰柔些，他没有澈底了解結義的一切，祇於三人之間，增加些隔膜，倒没有大關碍。</p>
<p>但是假面具終歸是假面具，歸根有撕破的一天。</p>

<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>（二十六）周紹平的絶書</p>
<p>「這裏有一封周紹平給你的信！」</p>
<p>「他搬了另一個醫院嗎？」他問時，那封信已放在他手裏了。</p>
<p>「施過手術後死了的」。看護毫無表情地答着便走開了。</p>
<p>石喬愕然良久，好像一道光忽然閃滅了似的，使他視線糢糊起來。當他帶着那封信走到一個僻静的所在張開來的時候，才算把視線集中，回復現實的感覺，同時才覺到一陣冷風從街口上刮過來，信紙顫抖着；</p>
<p>「石喬，我摯友：你走後，我才醒來，我也才曉得你一直伴送我到醫院。下午三時光景，醫生來施手術，痛却痛得死去活來，那顆彈丸却還没有鉗出來，據醫生說，那彈丸進去很深，靠近肺部僅一寸距離，從他那說話的表情上看來，我大槪是没有希望的人了。我因爲痛得暈過一陣又一陣，現在他已給我打了强心針，所以勉强能夠支持，更好在那顆彈丸是陷在左手的脅下，使我能有最後的機會和你筆談，這總算是很報運的事了。</p>
<p>我沉摯的石喬兄呀，當一個爲愛國而犧牲的戰士臨終的時候，你能想像到他總不外想說一番慷慨激昻的話以鼓勵同胞，或致溫柔追懷的遺言於其父母子女，但我覺得慷慨激昻的情緒已告了一個結束，這並不是因爲自已的懦弱臨死而氣餒；我更覺得徒然追懷父母爲不必要，這也不是因爲我本性狼毒，全無孝過之心，祗是啊，我認爲在目前中國的混亂現象之下，溫柔的家鄉是終被毁滅無餘，單純的慷慨精神，是决不足以自救救國的，我在前線上的時候，因爲一般同志正在奮勇應敵，故不願提出什麽國家根本問題來討論，討論之於戰爭時是最足以散漫軍心的。所以我一直將我所體騐到的問題隠在心底。現在我是明知没有希望的人了，這時候，充溢於我滿腔的話讓她奔流出來罷。現在我不妨老實的說，這次我的參加前線作戰，實際上是並不十分痛快的，換句話說，心理的矛盾正多得很！第一在軍隊組織及人員的本身上，我所發現的缺陷簡直使自已不能忍受。我在前線上所接近的自然是以士兵爲多，但是我在士兵的生活裏看出他們與長官很深的隔膜，長官們薪水之較高，尙爲常情，只是在作戰之時；長官們因養尊處優；誰也捨不得死，至於報紙上自然是全爲長官們宣傳的，尤其是這一次後方所給前線之慰勞品及慰勞金，這完全是我們用血汗，頭顱換得的一點安慰，然而全部給長官們　層　　　斷　　　　　　　　　問是敢怒而不敢言，雖則仍爲愛國心所驅使，依然上前接命。</p>

<p>After Song Sends Personnel to Take Over Various Agencies in Xuanhua, He Immediately Moves into Zhangjiakou. Deng Zhexi Brings a Letter from Feng to Report to Song About Feng's Departure from Zhangjiakou. Feng Hopes to Organize His Trusted Troops into a Guard Unit to Reside Temporarily in Zhangbei. The Military Affairs Council Still Suspects Feng, Who Has Not Had His Allied Army Title Revoked. (Beiping) Song Zheyuan Has Already Led His Troops to Arrive in Xuanhua Yesterday and is Scheduled to Proceed Directly to Zhangjiakou Today to Take Over Defense. The Beiping-Suiyuan Railway Cars Will Resume Passenger and Freight Service Within This Week Once the Troop Deployments are Complete. Sun Liangcheng and Fang Zhenwu's Two Units, Formerly Stationed in Xuanhua, Retreated on Foot to the Shalingzi-Zhangjiakou Area at 4 AM Yesterday. Feng Zhian's Division Arrived in Xuanhua Successively Yesterday. After Song, Accompanied by Jiang Bocheng and Qin Dechun, Arrived in Xuanhua Yesterday Afternoon, They Separately Dispatched Personnel to Take Over Various Agencies and Once Convened Representatives of Various Agencies to Discuss Measures to Maintain Public Order. Feng Yuxiang Sent Representative Wang Haimen to Xuanhua Yesterday Afternoon to Report to Song About the Recent Situation in Zhangjiakou, Saying That the Armies in Zhangjiakou Had Already Retreated to Zhangbei, Wanquan, and Other Places According to the Provisions of the Shacheng Meeting. Feng and Tong Lingge and Others All Hope That Song Will Move into Zhangjiakou Immediately to Meet with Feng so as to Facilitate the Handover of Everything. Song is Scheduled to Move into Zhangjiakou Today. The Vanguard of Feng Zhian's Division May Arrive in Zhangjiakou This Morning. It is Rumored That Feng Went to Wanquan Last Night, Which Remains to Be Verified. After Song Arrives in Chahar, He Will Begin to Investigate the Miscellaneous Troops in Chahar, Assess Them Based on Personnel, Horses, and Firearms, and Reorganize Them Accordingly, and Then Reorganize the Government and Consolidate Government Affairs. (Eighth Instant Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday Afternoon, Song Arrived at Xuanhua Railway Station and Used a Long-Distance Telephone to Communicate with the Headquarters of Xincun in Zhangjiakou, Reporting His Arrival in Xuanhua to Qiu Shanning. After Receiving the Report, Feng Convened a Meeting of Important Military Officers at the Headquarters of Xincun at 5 PM and Declared on the Spot His Determination to Leave Zhangjiakou and Return All Military and Political Power to the Government. Before Song Arrived, Tong Lingge Was Temporarily Responsible. At 9 PM That Evening, Feng, Together with His Wife Li Dequan and More Than 300 Escort Guards, Left Xincun by Car and Moved to Wanquan County, and Also Had a Letter in His Own Handwriting, Which He Handed to Deng Zhexi and Wang Haimen to Go to Xuanhua to Pass on to Song. The Letter Stated That He Personally Had Left Zhangjiakou for Other Places and Hoped to Convey This to All Parties. Deng and Others Returned to Xuanhua at 7 AM This Morning to Report to Song About Feng's Departure from Zhangjiakou. The Public Order of Zhangjiakou is Maintained by Song's Department, Peng Guozheng's Regiment, in Collaboration with the Police. The Majority of the Allied Army in Zhangjiakou City Began to Retreat Towards the Dajingmen Today. (Eighth Instant Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang Hopes to Organize His Trusted Troops into a Guard Unit to Reside Temporarily in Zhangbei. (Eighth Instant Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Spokesperson for the Military Affairs Council Said That Since Feng Issued the "Song-Ma" Telegrams, He Has Not Declared the Revocation of His Title of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and the Representatives He Sent in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangdong Still Propagated That Feng, in the Capacity of Commander-in-Chief, Handed Over Military and Political Affairs of Chahar Province to Song, But the Powers of Commander-in-Chief Have Not Been Revoked. It is Presumed That His Intention Seems to Contain Two Kinds of Effects: (1) After Song Returns to Chahar, He Will Try to Absorb His Subordinates; (2) If the Japanese Army Attacks Dolon, He Will Impute the Blame to the Fact That the Military Power of Chahar Province Had Long Been Handed Over to Song; If the Japanese Army Does Not Attack, He Will Quietly Reside in Chahar Province and Secretly Manipulate Everything, Making it Impossible for Song to Exercise His Powers. Therefore, the Authorities Here Have Issued Another Telegram to Song, Instructing Him to Pay Special Attention to Three Points: First, Feng Must Immediately Declare Clearly the Revocation of the Title of Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and the Headquarters Should Also Be Abolished Immediately; Second, the Miscellaneous Troops and Bandits in the Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua Area Must Be Temporarily Transferred to Zhangbei Bao Kang by Order of Feng, Awaiting Disbandment; Third, Feng Must Leave Zhangjiakou Immediately. Only After the Three Measures Are Completely Completed Can Song Return to Chahar and Exercise His Powers. (Eighth Instant Special Dispatch)</p>

It is Said That Traffic Will Be Restored on the Tenth. (Eighth Instant Special Dispatch)</p>

Feng Sent a Letter on August 5 Saying, 'From This Day Forward, Brother Will Completely End Military Affairs, And All Military and Political Affairs in Chahar Province Will Be Completely Returned to the Central Government for Handling, Brother Will Not Ask About It Anymore.'

<p>(Beiping) Although the Situation in Chahar Has Changed, It Seems That the Japanese Are Still Determined to Occupy Dolon Again.

<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong Arrived in Beiping Today and Went to Jurentang to Visit He After Getting Off the Train. According to Discussions, He Came to Report on the Lushan Conference. The Lushan Conference Discussed Matters Related to Military Reform. The Attendees Were All Members of the Military Affairs Commission, General Staff Headquarters, and Ministry of Military Administration. Various Personnel Have Drafted a Plan to Be Implemented in the Future. The Peaceful Resolution of the Chahar Incident Is Truly Fortunate. The Southwest Side Had Some Misunderstandings at the Time of Signing the Ceasefire Agreement Due to Conflicting Rumors Along the Way. After I Went to Explain, All Misunderstandings Have Been Resolved. Regarding Internal Affairs, Because Military Affairs in North China Have Just Been Settled and the South Is in a Period of Bandit Suppression, It Will Not Be Easy to Proceed Before the End of Military Affairs. After Military Affairs Are Completely Concluded, Internal Affairs Can Naturally Get on Track. China's Floods Have Been Very Serious Over the Years, and the Prevention Work Is Not Unified. The Interior Is Just Wanting to Rectify This. The Center of the Communist Bandits Is Still in Jiangxi, and the Achievements in Suppressing Them Are Very Good.

<p>Strikes Spread Nationwide, Leading to Bloodshed</p>
<p>The President Loses Popular Support and Still Clings to Power</p>
<p>Internal Turmoil in Cuba Results in American Intervention</p>
<p>Havana: The situation here has become even more critical today. Upon hearing the news of President Machado's resignation, crowds gathered in the streets, cheering and celebrating. Secret police, while clearing the streets, opened fire with rifles, killing about fifteen people, causing widespread panic. Subsequently, troops, under the President's orders, moved in and occupied the entire city, assisting the police in maintaining order. Due to widespread strikes, the President declared it a passive revolution against him and ordered martial law to be implemented today. Currently, train services are disrupted, and due to severe riots inland, coupled with a telegraph workers' strike, communication with the capital has been cut off. U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Welles, acknowledges that mediation efforts have reached a deadlock because the Liberal Party refuses to discuss shortening the President's term. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Cuban Capital: The general strike on the island of Cuba is spreading, increasingly taking on a political character. All transportation, commerce, industry, postal and telegraph services, and public works have joined the strike. Parliament is scheduled to meet in the afternoon to discuss suspending constitutional guarantees. If this proposal is passed, it may lead to serious incidents. If that happens, all mediation efforts will be significantly affected. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) Although there are rumors in official circles that Cuban President Machado will not resign, many expect him to step down and seek refuge abroad. The New York Times believes the current situation in Cuba will force the United States to intervene. The U.S. Army and Navy prepared an intervention plan six months ago. However, it is said that President Roosevelt opposes U.S. intervention in Cuba. Police in Havana fired on civilians in the streets, and reports of casualties vary. Some say twenty were killed, others ninety, with about two hundred wounded. It is reported that hundreds have been arrested. The public, believing the inaccurate radio reports that the President had already resigned, became ecstatic and gathered outside the Presidential Palace, dancing and celebrating. Unexpectedly, soldiers and police stationed on the roof of the Presidential Palace and other key locations opened machine guns, firing down on them. Many of the wounded sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy, and the embassy has been transformed into a hospital due to the large number of people there. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Cuban Capital: The strike in Cuba was initially thought to have been instigated by President Machado to threaten U.S. Ambassador Welles in Cuba. It is now known that this is not the case, as the strike has spread nationwide and aims to remove President Machado. According to recent reports, the strike was initiated by various workers' groups and is being supported by students. The strike is developing rapidly, with frequent acts of violence, making Ambassador Welles' mediation increasingly difficult. Regardless of the cause of the strike, the U.S. State Department has decided to send warships only when absolutely necessary, hoping that Ambassador Welles' mediation will succeed. Yesterday, President Roosevelt spent the entire day at Hyde Park talking with Ambassador Welles on the phone, offering to mediate. Ambassador Welles reported to President Roosevelt that only President Machado's resignation would resolve the Cuban situation; otherwise, it would be difficult to prevent Cuba from descending into anarchy. U.S. political figures largely agree with Ambassador Welles' view. Washington has been deeply moved by the refusal of hundreds of Cuban senior military officers to participate in suppressing the strike. It is believed here that the situation will be clear within two or three days. It is hoped that after Machado leaves, his successor will be Colonel Carlos, who strongly opposes Machado and was once imprisoned. He is currently taking refuge in the United States.</p>
<p>(Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Havana: The revolutionary tide in Cuba is intensifying. The police are unable to stop the disturbances in the capital, and there are reports of unrest in the military. President Machado went to a villa outside the capital tonight to consider Ambassador Welles' proposal to step down. Welles proposed that President Machado and the current Secretary of State, Ferrara, both resign immediately and that a new Secretary of State be appointed to temporarily assume presidential powers. This solution is believed to have been approved by President Roosevelt by both the Cuban government and the revolutionary party; otherwise, the U.S. Ambassador would not have proposed it rashly. Even neutral countries consider this the only way for President Machado to step down with honor. It is said that both the government and the revolutionary party representatives were satisfied when the U.S. Ambassador presented this proposal. However, Machado, supported by Congress's passage of a bill authorizing him to suspend all constitutional guarantees, declare martial law, and empower him to mobilize troops to suppress the labor unrest, is still making a final struggle. He broadcast a radio message to the nation from his villa tonight, calling on the people to rise up and protect Cuban sovereignty, and urging the strikers to immediately return to work. His call to protect sovereignty is intended to highlight the concern of American intervention and to divert the anger of the strikers into a united front against foreign powers. In addition, a strict martial law has been implemented in Havana, with more than a thousand soldiers deployed to maintain order. At the same time, martial law has also been declared in Camagüey, where the riots are said to have been quelled, resulting in several deaths. The revolutionary party claims that the Congress's passage of the bill was due to coercion and did not represent genuine support. If the government dispatches troops to suppress the strikers, it would be tantamount to using the military against the entire nation, as no one is currently working. Therefore, if the military moves, an open and serious rebellion will occur. All political parties recognize that the situation is very serious and that failure to resolve it quickly could lead to American action. The U.S. President is closely monitoring the Cuban situation and, although determined to avoid intervention, is deeply concerned about recent developments. He opposes intervention in principle but also abhors bloodshed. Acts of violence are increasing daily. Today, over a thousand striking workers and sympathizers gathered in a large park here. When the police tried to disperse them without success, they opened machine guns, but still tried to avoid injuring the crowd, so only a few were injured and two were killed. According to official reports, there have been relatively few casualties nationwide since the outbreak of the strike, with a total of seven deaths and eighteen injuries. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(New York) Currently, there are still armed revolutionary forces in Oriente Province and near Cape Môle, but there is no sign of them concentrating their forces to advance on the capital. Therefore, all parties believe that the revolutionary goals can be achieved if the police also join the strike. Many police officials have been secretly identified by President Machado's detectives as failing to execute government orders, and they are being executed without trial.</p>
<p>American expatriates here believe that if Machado is forced to step down and the United States is informed of the matter in advance, it could enhance the Cuban people's feelings toward the United States, as long as there is no further intervention in the future. It is often believed that the American business community is the backer of President Machado, and even Machado's election was due to the efforts of the American business community. The American business community has very close ties with Cuba and cannot remain indifferent to Cuban politics. It is predicted that the American sugar, electricity, and banking industries will all be involved in the selection of a temporary or permanent president for Cuba. The current movement to overthrow the government is due to excessive taxes. Currently, the average burden per person is forty-five yuan. This was not felt as a burden during economic prosperity, but when the economy declined, it became unbearable, and resentment arose, leading to the revolution. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>All Industries Rebounding, Prices Rising</p>
<p>(New York) American economist Babson reported on the U.S. economic situation today, stating that 70% of the increase in U.S. prices is a genuine increase, and 70% of the improvement in U.S. industries is a genuine recovery. The remaining 30% is due to speculation and enthusiasm for greater progress. However, the rise in prices and the progress in industries in such a short period can be described as the fastest ever seen in the United States, especially in July. However, it has now entered a period of irregular price fluctuations, which is why various markets have been sluggish recently. However, this period may not last long. Babson's statement that 70% is genuine progress is based on his various market fluctuation charts and is highly reliable. Before the economic decline began in 1929, Babson had already predicted the collapse of the stock market based on these charts. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>Requesting Full Authority to Manage Sales</p>
<p>Difficulties in Reducing Cuban Sugar Imports</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Sugar Industry Association today requested the government to make it the dictator of the beet sugar industry, granting it full authority to manage all sales matters, subject to government supervision. This recommendation by the Association is included in a supplementary sales agreement, which has been approved by all parties in the industry and submitted to the government for approval today. The industry previously submitted a sales agreement stipulating that if Cuban sugar imports could be limited to 1.76 million tons per year, then sugar produced in the U.S. mainland would be reduced to 1.865 million tons. The U.S. government is considering this proposal tonight and attempting to compromise with the Cuban sugar industry's demand for a larger import quota. It is reported that Cuba wants to import 3.5 million tons annually, or at least insists on 2 million tons. However, it is also difficult to reduce Cuban sugar imports because not only is a large portion of the Cuban sugar industry American capital, but it would also reduce U.S. tariff revenue. Currently, Cuban sugar is taxed at two cents per pound. If the minimum amount requested by Cuba is accepted, the annual tax revenue would be one hundred million yuan. Conversely, if the amount proposed by the U.S. Sugar Industry Association is followed, the annual tax revenue would only be 68 million yuan at the current tax rate, resulting in a loss of 32 million yuan. This is a major problem for the treasury deficit, especially during times of financial strain.</p>

<p>Japanese People Greatly Disappointed with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Sawada and Terao Have to Postpone Their Departure</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Simla conference, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has requested the British government to commit to confirming two essential conditions for the meeting: that the commercial treaty concluded between Japan and India not be changed by the British government and that a temporary agreement be established to avoid being treated as a country without a treaty before a new treaty is established. However, the British government avoided a definite answer in its reply on the 2nd, and it is difficult to expect a quick response. Therefore, the departure of the two representatives, Sawada and Terao, scheduled for August 24th, has to be postponed. There is no hope of concluding negotiations before the expiry date of the current commercial treaty, October 10th. Ambassador Sawada stated that without these two guarantees, the Simla conference would be like a castle in the air. It has been four months since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the termination of the treaty, and it is being manipulated by the clever diplomatic tactics of the British government. Wasting time in such an inconclusive state makes the Simla conference increasingly disadvantageous to Japan. The relevant ministries are extremely concerned about this, and the public is also expressing disappointment with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' handling of the matter. (Dentsu Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>Britain Expresses No Opposition</p>
<p>(Paris) It is learned that the French government is still awaiting the protest being drafted by the Japanese government regarding the French Navy's occupation of nine small islands. The French government sent a formal notification to the Japanese government three weeks ago regarding the flag-raising occupation of these islands, pointing out that the Japanese company that wanted to operate phosphate mines on the islands had failed and withdrawn in 1925. Therefore, it is now believed that the Japanese government's communication to the French government will be a request for explanation, not a protest. The British government has announced that it does not oppose the French Navy's occupation of the nine small islands because they are not on shipping lanes and have no residents except for a few Chinese fishermen. However, these islands are important for the traffic along the French Vietnamese coastlines and can also serve as a base for seaplanes and submarines. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

Especially with regard to the stated value, it is extremely appropriate and fully substantiated, and it specifically expresses the intention to reduce it to 50 million gold rubles. The Soviet Russian delegation immediately proposed a genuine review of all issues related to the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Furthermore, the Manchurian delegation respects the proper handling of existing treaties and considers mutual interests, which has greater significance at this meeting. The Soviet Russian delegation, with the same sincerity, expects to express its intention to achieve the success of the meeting. Furthermore, today's meeting between the two countries' representatives did not involve the issue of calculating gold rubles; it only touched on the issue of valuation. (Dentsu Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The sixth round of negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway ended without result because a solution could not be found for the pre-arranged transfer price. Yesterday, Manchurian representative Tadashi Ohashi and Soviet Russian representative Kazlovsky began informal talks on the conversion of rubles, which is the basis for calculating the price. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as the mediator, is deeply dissatisfied with the high conversion rate of 1.4 rubles per gold ruble proposed by the Soviet Russian side, dismissing it. Furthermore, the Japan-Russia Fisheries Agreement adopts the principle of converting one ruble to 0.325 Japanese yen, and in 1931, an American insurance company established a conversion agreement with Soviet Russia for 0.35 rubles per ruble. It is said that the Soviet Russian side's figures were not corrected, failing to fulfill the mediator's responsibilities. Furthermore, if the conversion rate is 0.325, then the 250 million rubles proposed by the Soviet Russian side is 81.25 million yen. If it is 0.25, then it is 62.5 million yen, not far from the Manchurian side's proposed 50 million yen. Therefore, the solution to the problem lies in whether a consistent conversion rate can be found. The private consultations between the Russian and Manchurian representatives are highly significant. (Dentsu Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) During today's meeting, the Manchurian representative read a statement acknowledging the value of the Chinese Eastern Railway to "Manchukuo" but stating that the railway has no value to Soviet Russia. The Russian newspaper Pravda commented on this matter, stating that although the Japanese representative participated in the meeting as an observer, if Japan genuinely intends for the negotiations to succeed, then its mediation will definitely have sufficient influence on the Manchurian representative. If the Manchurian representative insists on the original price of 50 million Japanese yen, and the mediation permitted by the Japanese government ultimately fails to take effect, then it will be known that the Japanese side is not genuinely striving for mediation. Japan's scheme to instigate the breakdown of the meeting, hiding behind the "Manchukuo" independence, cannot deceive anyone. The Russian representative's declaration at the last meeting has already expressed the Soviet Russian side's readiness to facilitate the success of the negotiations. Now, it only remains for those who control Japanese policy to choose whether or not to support the completion of the negotiations. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported on August 2nd that since the failure of the World Economic Conference, the economic nationalism and regional economic alliances of various countries have become increasingly acute. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in view of the inevitable trend in the world, is striving for "economic diplomacy" and "establishment of commercial rights." It has already prepared principled and concrete plans. In response to the trend of nationalistic alliances, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will reorganize its existing Europe-America Bureau into the Europe Bureau and newly establish several bureaus to focus on various aspects. As for the responsibilities of the American Bureau, it will be responsible for the affairs of American citizens and serve as a symbol of the close relationship with the United States. At the same time, it will also study measures to revise maritime treaties and address military issues. In addition to the above, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also established a committee with a budget of 40 million yen for the Asia Bureau and the International Cultural Bureau to enhance its diplomatic capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Training Civilians in Urban Air Defense <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>A statement by Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Administration, regarding the development of the air force was published in this newspaper on the 5th. It emphasized the importance of training civilians in urban air defense, with the first large-scale civilian air defense exercise scheduled to be held in Nanjing in sixteen months, followed by a second exercise in Shanghai twelve months later, and a third in Tianjin. The intention seems to be to complete the air defense arrangements in China's vulnerable areas within three years. It is believed by world military experts that the Second World War will break out in 1936, three years from now.</p>
<p>Urban air defense exercises involve matters handled by military authorities and preparations to be made by the people. The establishment of an air defense command and the fulfillment of the qualifications required by the air defense commander are matters that should be handled by the military authorities. Disseminating knowledge of aerial warfare and cultivating agile and orderly habits are the preparations that the people should make. The former is not the subject of this article, so I will briefly describe the latter.</p>
<p>The awesomeness of aerial warfare lies in the intensity of the suffering it causes and the speed with which enemy aircraft arrive. The rubble in Zhabei still remains, and we should have recognized the power of the air force. As for its speed, modern aircraft fly at a speed of 180 to 240 kilometers per hour, with an average speed of over 60 meters per second (equivalent to 200 old feet). For example, the distance of 16 kilometers between Shanghai and Wusong is only a five-minute flight. If the citizens are not trained in air defense, the warning sound will not have stopped, and the enemy aircraft will have arrived, dropping explosive bombs, and disaster will strike. Therefore, urban air defense usually establishes air defense monitoring posts with reconnaissance aircraft 120 to 130 kilometers away from the defense center. So that the city can hear the warning, the defensive air force can fly out to meet the enemy, and the citizens can immediately extinguish the lights and stop all actions to avoid becoming targets for enemy aircraft. The air defense command can also carry out camouflage operations or disguise targets that the enemy aircraft would want to obtain in open areas to exhaust their bombing power.</p>
<p>Regardless of how quickly the air defense authorities carry out camouflage work or how the air defense forces engage the enemy, the residents of the city under air attack should complete their evacuation within twenty minutes of hearing the alarm at the latest. This evacuation includes: (1) Immediately extinguish all city lights in accordance with the lighting management regulations. (2) Quickly enter the pre-designated bunkers. (3) Stop all actions that may be visible to enemy aircraft, even to avoid any shadows, smoke, or dust being detected in the city. During urban air defense exercises, the duties of the air defense police are particularly important. It is not easy to have a large group of chaotic and panicked citizens orderly and quickly complete all the things they should do under air defense regulations in an instant without good command and supervision. Chinese people have a habit of shouting for their wives and children when they encounter emergencies and often rush to be the first. All of these are things that should not happen when being attacked by enemy aircraft. If a large team of trained air defense police is not dispatched to patrol the districts, the problem of everyone crowding one boat is bound to happen.</p>
<p>Shanghai has already suffered from Japanese aircraft attacks during the January 28th Incident last year. However, for more than a year, we have only seen news of air defense exercises in Tokyo, and we ourselves have not received training in air raid evacuation after suffering huge sacrifices. Now, on the occasion of the Director of the Aviation Administration's announcement of the timing of air defense exercises, I will briefly describe what I know. I deeply hope that domestic military experts can do more to increase the people's knowledge of air defense.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 7th – Britain and France, regarding the German National Socialist Party's radio broadcasts and leaflet drops in Austria, have sent similar notes to the German government, stating that the actions of the German Party are contrary to existing treaties. The German government has now responded, denying any breach of treaty and stating that it deems such intervention in the German-Austrian dispute to be unacceptable. Furthermore, according to the German Public Gazette, the German government does not understand how the Four-Power Pact could be invoked in such an event. From the German perspective, Germany has not violated any treaty. German newspapers also carry officially authorized articles criticizing the Dollfuss government (Austria) for disregarding the moral and spiritual changes of the Austrian people. The articles also criticize France and its allies for allowing Austria to establish an auxiliary police force of 18,000, which is contrary to the spirit of the Four-Power Pact.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 7th – The Times published an editorial on the German-Austrian situation, stating, "The tension in German-Austrian relations is attracting great attention from various countries, as evidenced by Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss's formal visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Mussolini's assistance to Dollfuss in maintaining Austrian independence makes international observers believe in the sincerity of Italy's assistance to Austria. How Berlin will react is also of great interest to us. In short, there are currently multifaceted diplomatic actions aimed at clarifying the atmosphere in Central Europe." The Times concluded that the current negotiations are aimed at opening up a situation so that the German-Austrian dispute can be resolved before it becomes a conflict. The Times believes that immediately submitting the German-Austrian issue to the Council of the League of Nations for review would be a major inconvenience because German nationalism is currently on the rise. Submitting the issue to the League of Nations would publicly declare German responsibility to the world, which may provoke a fierce reaction from the German people. The Times also stated, "However, if Germany fails to understand the warnings from all parties, the major powers can only submit the case to the Council of the League of Nations for review in accordance with the letter and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and will no longer intervene in negotiations. The Council will also only take appropriate measures in accordance with the text and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant."</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Vienna, 7th – One of the Austrian patrol officers on the Austrian-German border near Kufstein in Salzburg Province was shot and killed today. The shooter's clothing was similar to that worn by the German volunteer labor corps currently stationed across the border in Kiefersfelden. Austrian authorities have dispatched additional auxiliary police to the scene of the incident and established a line of sentries along the border, cutting off traffic near the scene. It is reported that while the Austrian patrol officers were serving within their boundary, fifteen individuals wearing steel helmets suddenly launched an attack, firing a volley of shots. One Austrian patrol officer was shot in the chest and fell to the ground. His companions immediately returned fire, and the attackers fled, and it is unknown if there were any injuries. The Austrian people are currently very agitated, believing that this attack was prearranged. Four individuals have been arrested, including three members of the Austrian Social Democratic Party. On the 3rd of this month, a similar incident occurred, but no one was injured at that time. It is now believed that the German attack was an act of revenge because a German was loitering near the border, and when Austrian soldiers ordered him to stop and he did not comply, they opened fire and shot him.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Vienna, 7th – According to Munich sources, the Austrian policeman who was shot and killed while patrolling the Austrian-German border was named Schwanninger. This matter seems to have international implications, as Britain and France recently sent notes to the German Foreign Ministry protesting the National Socialist Party's propaganda in Austria. It is reported that the German reply has now been issued, stating that Germany does not wish to discuss the matter. Austrian troops are now rushing to the border, and traffic is now closed.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin, Vienna, 7th – As the conflict between the Austrian National Socialist Party and the Dollfuss government intensifies, a very large swastika was painted on the side of a mountain near Innsbruck, visible throughout the town.

The cabinet's power extends to all kinds of affairs, except for national defense, foreign affairs, and religious authority, which are held by the Governor.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Japan with the Scent of War (Japan Correspondence) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Strengthening Naval and Army Forces to Deal with the United States and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Important Cities in the Kanto Area Rehearse Air Defense</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Japanese also claim to be a maritime nation like the British Isles. However, Britain has always maintained its identity as a maritime nation because it developed early, so almost all of the world's undeveloped land and abundant natural resources have been occupied and developed by the British Empire. Therefore, its colonies are all over the world, and its military strength is naturally focused on the navy. Japan, on the other hand, is the opposite. Although it is a maritime nation, it concentrates all its attention on the continent. Its two foreign wars, the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, were both decided by land battles. Therefore, in the past, before the era of Aritomo Yamagata, the navy was under the command of the General Staff Headquarters. In other words, the army warlords led the navy warlords. It was not until Yamagata was about to die that the Naval Command was separated from the command of the General Staff Headquarters and became independent.</p>
<p>Until recently, the vanguard of Japanese imperialism was still the army. For example, it was the army that provoked the September 18th Mukden Incident, and it was the army that seized the territory of the three northeastern provinces. Although it was the navy that provoked the Shanghai Incident, in the end, it still mobilized more than four divisions of the army to regain its face. As for the invasion of Rehe and the attack on eastern Tianjin, it was entirely dependent on the army. From one perspective, the Japanese army can be said to be at its peak, invincible. Therefore, it is truly considered the favored son of heaven in the country. Coupled with the promotion of the veterans' associations, it considers itself invincible. However, the enemy it has found is China, which is said to have many soldiers but lacks modern weapons and equipment. In fact, its victory is only the victory of weapons that are one level higher, and not a victory of spirit. Its weapons are only slightly better than China's. If it were to compare with continental military powers such as France, it would be a case of a small sorcerer meeting a great one. Even compared with the emerging Soviet Union, it feels inferior. First, in terms of modern mechanized units, the entire Japanese army has only two regiments, while the Soviet Union has four mechanized divisions. Second, in terms of aircraft, the entire Japanese army and navy have only about 1,200 aircraft. Adding the 150 civilian aircraft, it still does not reach 1,500. The Soviet Union has four times as many, and the United States has eight times as many. In the naval sphere, Japan also feels quite satisfied, because in terms of naval tonnage figures, it ranks first except for Britain and the United States. Although seizing Honolulu is not sufficient, maintaining traffic in the East China Sea and the West Pacific is more than enough. Moreover, it has its own special defense and attack capabilities. In the naval aspect, its first strength is its submarines. They are new, well-equipped, have long endurance, and strong attack power. Not only is the United States far behind, but even Britain, the king of the seas, is amazed. The second is heavy and light cruisers. Although the number of ships is less than that of the United States, the speed and the range of the guns are higher than those of the United States. Therefore, its army and navy are sufficient to deal with both the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>However, its main shortcomings at present, as mentioned above,</p>
<p>apart from mechanized units (because mechanized units can only be used on land, then they are only useful in the theaters of the three northeastern provinces or Mongolia, and only during the war with the Soviet Union, and have little other use), it has another major shortcoming, which is the air force, because the air force can take off from aircraft carriers at sea, can use islands as bases, and can also use the Shandong Peninsula or the vicinity of Shanghai as bases to attack major Japanese cities. Therefore, the Japanese military is very vigilant against foreign air raids. Especially after the recent success of flying across the ocean, it is even more vigilant. It envisions, if foreign aircraft were to attack, what should Japan do? Therefore, it pays great attention to air defense, especially in major cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, and strives to build air defense facilities. In addition to active defenses such as anti-aircraft guns and sound locators, there are also passive defenses such as smoke screens, traffic control, lighting management, and poison gas and medical assistance. On the 20th of this month, air defense exercises will be held in important cities in the Kanto area. Twelve aircraft will be formed into three teams to act as enemy aircraft, flying to Tokyo to drop bombs and poison gas. On the defense side, a defense command headquarters has been established within the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The former commander of the First Division, Mr. Hayashi Sen-no-suke, is the commander of the exercise security. Civilian youth groups will all be mobilized to assist in various passive defenses. At 1:00 PM, a warning of an air raid was received. The Guard Division and the First Division were fully mobilized and deployed in all important locations. Of course, the Ministry of the Army was full of the scent of war. The area near the Ministry of the Army was covered with dense smoke screens, and the poison gas team and the fire brigade were all ready for action. In short, everything was in a state of war, and the management of lighting was the only stimulant to promote civilian tension. From the above exercises, we can see Japan's active preparations for war and its emphasis on air defense. (July 28, 1933, Tokyo)</p>

<p>The Military and Political Affairs of Chahar Are All Under the Control of Song Zheyuan</p>
<p>General Feng Will Leave Zhangjiakou and Move to Zhangbei</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping - The situation in Chahar has taken a sudden turn. Feng sent a representative, Liu Zhizhou, to Shacheng to visit Pang Bingxun and Guan Linzheng, stating that Feng was willing to accept the four principles of Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek's telegram and the three measures proposed by He Yingqin. He hoped that Song Zheyuan would meet with Feng's representative in Shacheng to end the military situation and return the administration of Chahar. The Beiping authorities received Pang and Guan's telegrams and immediately invited Song and others to discuss the matter. It was decided that Song would first go to Chahar to handle the matter. Song, accompanied by Qin Dechun, Jiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, and Feng's representatives Deng Zhexin and Li Xin, went north at 8:00 AM yesterday and arrived in Shacheng at 1:00 PM. They met with the frontline generals Pang Bingxun and Xu Tingyao and held brief discussions. When Feng heard that Song was going to Chahar, he sent Tong Lingge and his chief of staff, Qiu Shanning, to Xiahuayuan to meet with Song. Song rested briefly in Shacheng and then accompanied Qin Dechun to Xiahuayuan to wait for Tong and others. At around 10:00 PM, Tong and others arrived in Xiahuayuan. Song discussed matters with Tong and others in the car and then went to Shacheng together to discuss everything in detail. After the meeting, Tong and others returned to Zhangjiakou to report. Song Zheyuan and Jiang Bocheng sent a telegram to Beiping this morning, reporting that the negotiations were satisfactory and that peace was hopeful. Xiong Bin also returned to Beiping at 5:00 PM today (the 6th), reporting on the proceedings. Song Zheyuan will temporarily stay in Shacheng to take charge of everything. Two regiments of Song's department, Feng Zhian's division, set off to the Ping Sui Line today to take over the defense. At 1:00 PM today, Feng issued a circular telegram, returning the administration of Chahar. After the circular telegram was issued, Feng heard that he would leave Zhangjiakou and move to Zhangbei, which is 125 li away from Zhangjiakou. Before Song returns to Chahar, local security will be temporarily maintained by Tong Lingge in the name of the Chahar Provincial Garrison Commander. Song's troops will gradually move to take over the defense. (Feng's circular telegram can be found in this newspaper's special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>There are two reasons for the sudden change in the Chahar situation: (1) The situation between the two sides was tense and urgent. If they did not each take a step back, a tragic fratricidal conflict would inevitably occur. (2) The Japanese and puppet troops have again fallen into Duolun, and the Chahar vehicle is in danger. The bandits have penetrated deeply and it is urgent to unite against the invaders. Feng, under internal and external pressure, resolutely requested Song to return to Chahar and return the administration. The authorities, since Feng had made concessions, should act in good faith and meet frankly, ordering Song to return to Chahar and resolve the situation peacefully. The Chahar affair, which has been in dispute for several months, can now be brought to a close. (August 6th)</p>

Funing, Qian'an, and Zunhua counties have also been unable to go because puppet troops are still entrenched there. Qian'an County Magistrate Lu Qingchen is still staying in Tangshan. Funing County Magistrate Liu Xingpei went to Funing to take over, but was blocked by puppet troops. He telegraphed the provincial government, requesting Li Jichun to send personnel to assist. The provincial government has instructed Xue Zhiheng to inform Li Jichun to assist. There are quite a few puppet troops in the Qian'an area, and they are trying to disband them, or seek to transport them out of the pass. Japanese and puppet troops are mixed in Zunhua County. The Japanese army has a warehouse there, which has not yet been moved, and the garrison has not been withdrawn. The county magistrate of the county, Pei Huanxing, is stranded in Tianjin, and it is difficult to predict when the takeover will take place.</p>
<p>The Japanese army announced that it would withdraw from all routes from the 4th and complete the withdrawal by the 8th. On the Beining Line, all the Kwantung Army east of Changli began to be transported out of Shanhaiguan on the 4th. The guard troops originally stationed along the line will continue to be stationed as usual, as permitted by the Boxer Protocol. On the Pingbei side, the headquarters of the Suzuki Brigade in Miyun began to send troops to Gubeikou. About 100 members of the 8th Field Artillery Regiment withdrew to Rehe yesterday (the 5th) and went to Chengde. The Japanese army in Miyun City will not be completely withdrawn, and plans to leave twenty or thirty people to be stationed for a long time. As for the important places inside the Great Wall passes, such as Nantianmen, Saheqiao, Jianchangying, and Shimenzhai, troops will be stationed and will not be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Since the war zones were taken over, the Japanese army has been causing various troubles, violating the spirit of the truce agreement. In short, (1) the Japanese army in the war zone refuses to withdraw completely, (2) Linyu County Town is not allowed to be taken over, (3) interfering in administration, (4) the Beining Line requires conditions for traffic. The Beiping authorities are compromising and negotiating with the Japanese army repeatedly, but have not been able to resolve the matter satisfactorily. The main issue for Huang Fu's trip south this time is to negotiate the diplomatic policy of North China and to solve the various difficult problems in the takeover of the war zone.</p>
<p>The puppet troops of Li Jichun's department within the war zone have been reorganized. The takeover committee member Xue Zhiheng, who was in Tangshan to negotiate the reorganization, returned to Tianjin last night, visited Yu Xuezhong, and reported on the reorganization process. A total of 4,000 officers and soldiers were retained in the reorganized department. The new salary will be paid by the provincial government from August onwards. Yu Xuezhong, believing that the reorganization of the department has been completed, specially instructed Xue Zhiheng to inform Li that since the department has been reorganized, it will be a national force in the future. He hoped that he would pay attention to discipline, maintain local order, and suppress bandits in order to secure the people. The department of Shi Yousan was originally scheduled to go to Yutian to await reorganization, but due to certain relations, it has not yet been transferred. The disposal of the department is still under negotiation.</p>
<p>Within the war zone, in addition to the puppet troops of Li Jichun and Shi Yousan, small groups of scattered bandits are as numerous as hairs. After the reorganization of Li's department, the scattered bandits still occupy various counties, towns, and villages, raping, looting, and making the people destitute. The counties that have been taken over have only taken over the county seat, and have not yet found a way to maintain order in the countryside. Therefore, the strength of the county magistrates cannot reach beyond the city walls. Scattered bandits cannot be suppressed, and all post-war reconstruction cannot proceed. The area of the war zone is extremely large, and the army is limited to the agreement and cannot be stationed there. The only force that can be used to suppress bandits and maintain order is the 8,000 special police, which is actually very difficult. Regarding the post-war reconstruction in the war zone, the authorities are preparing relief through the War Zone Relief Committee on the one hand, and striving to clear the countryside to secure the local area on the other. It is impossible to clear the countryside solely by relying on special police. It is planned to organize local militias to assist in the work, which is currently being planned.</p>
<p>The traffic on the Beining Line has not yet been realized. Recently, the Japanese army in the east began to withdraw, and it was scheduled to open the line on the 8th. Beforehand, the two sides held a meeting in Yuguan to discuss all the procedures in detail. Our representative Yin Tong and Beining Line representative Xu Ji went the other day, but the Japanese unexpectedly demanded that the Beining Line's trains go directly to Shenyang, and the puppet Fengshan Line's trains also go directly to Beiping. Our side believes that such an arrangement would be tantamount to implicitly recognizing the puppet state, which is of great importance. Therefore, the Yuguan meeting could not be held, and the problem of traffic is also difficult to solve. (August 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Confession of Captured Bandits on the Composition of Bandit Army <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Each Army Corps is Smaller than a National Army Division</p>
<p>The Blockade of the Bandit Areas is a Fatal Blow Nanchang Correspondence - The highest military authority recently obtained a very detailed account of the internal military organization of the Red Bandits from a senior Red Bandit member who surrendered, □□□. It details the number of puppet armies and puppet divisions under each puppet army corps, the number of men and guns in each puppet army and puppet division, and their combat strength. Although the bandit army has designated numbers, the so-called army corps is even smaller than a National Army division. Moreover, there have been many deaths in previous battles. According to the confession, several army and division commanders have also been killed in action, and the situation below is even more imaginable. Moreover, after the bandit areas were tightly blockaded, supplies were cut off, and there was a severe shortage of weapons and ammunition, which was a fatal blow to them. The confession of the senior member is as follows:</p>
<p>The Red Bandits take Jiangxi as their main base of operations, so their internal organization is relatively tight. In terms of military affairs, there is a Military Commission, with Zhu De as chairman and Peng Dehuai and Wang Jiaxiang as deputies. All the Red Bandits in Jiangxi are organized into the First Front Army, with Zhu De as the commander-in-chief and Zhou Enlai as the political commissar. They are also organized into three puppet army corps: the First, Third, and Fifth. The contents of each army corps are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e98">Puppet First Army Corps <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Commander-in-chief Lin Biao, political commissar Nie Rongzhen. The army corps is divided into three armies: the Third, Fourth, and Eleventh. The puppet Third Army Commander is Xu Yangang, and the political commissar is Zhu Rui. This army is better armed and has about 4,000 men, responsible for encirclement. The army is divided into three divisions: the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth, with the Seventh Division being the strongest in combat. The puppet Fourth Army Commander is Zhou Kun, who is as timid as a woman and does not say a word all day. He is brave and good at fighting. The political commissar is Luo Ruiqing, and the chief of staff is Li Yu.</p>
<p>This army has good weapons and combat strength, and is brave in charging. In every battle, it undertakes many attack missions, with about 5,000 men. The army is divided into three divisions: the Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth, with the Tenth and Twelfth Divisions being the strongest in combat. The puppet Tenth Division Commander Chen Guang is the bravest, and has been killed in action. The political commissar is Li Xijiu. This division has 28, 29, and 30 regiments. The puppet Eleventh Division Commander is Wu, who has been killed in action. The political commissar is Liu Yaxiu. This division has 31, 32, and 33 regiments. The puppet Twelfth Division Commander is Liu Haiyun, and the political commissar is Liu Yan. This division has 34, 35, and 36 regiments. The puppet Eleventh Army only has the 31st Division. This division was originally the 13th Division of the puppet Fourth Army, with good weapons and more than 2,000 men.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Puppet Third Army Corps <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>

<p>The commander-in-chief was originally Ji Zhendong, under the jurisdiction of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Armies. The Thirteenth Army Commander is Dong Zhentang, the Fourteenth Army Commander is Zhao Bosheng, and the Fifteenth Army Commander is Huang Yuezhong. When they invaded Fujian, Ji and Huang were imprisoned, and Dong Zhentang was appointed commander-in-chief. The Fourteenth Army was cancelled and merged into the Thirteenth Army. The Fifteenth Army of the army corps was exchanged with the Third Army of the First Army Corps for surveillance purposes. Therefore, the jurisdiction of this army corps became the Third and Thirteenth Armies. In the Battle of Shuikou, this army corps suffered the greatest losses. Zhu and Mao deeply felt that the mixed use of the north and south armies was ineffective, so they reorganized again, and the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Armies were still organized into the Fifth Army Corps, while the Third Army was returned to the First Army Corps. The current commander-in-chief is still Dong Zhentang. The Thirteenth Army Commander Zhao Bosheng has been killed in action (in the Battle of Huangshidu), and the successor is unknown.

<h3 id="e102">Fierce Battle Against Bandits in Anyuan by the Southern Route Army <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Headquarters of the Southern Route Army Established in Dayu</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, with the 1st Army Commander concurrently serving as the 1st Column Commander, Yu Hanmou, held a military conference in Dayu a few days ago. Subsequently, the headquarters of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army was established, with Yu Hanmou concurrently serving as the director of the headquarters. The personnel of the headquarters are also concurrently filled by personnel from the 1st Army headquarters. The second phase of the communist suppression military operations is now actively underway. The 7th and 8th Divisions of the 2nd Column have been ordered to advance towards Junmenling. The 4th Division of the 1st Column, led by Zhang Meixin, and the 44th Division of the Guangxi Army, led by Wang Zanbin, encountered the main force of the communist bandits in the Zun San Wei area near Anyuan. The two sides engaged in an extremely fierce battle. Wang's division, led by Ling Moxie, besieged the communist bandits in the Zun San Wei area of the southern district of Anyuan for over ten days. One regiment of the bandit forces still stubbornly resisted with all their might. On the 28th and 29th of last month, over a thousand bandits, belonging to the pseudo-Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's 22nd Division, came from Huichang to reinforce them. They were fiercely attacked by Ling's regiment, resulting in the death of over 40 bandits. The bandits failed and retreated towards Huangbaikeng. On the 29th, approximately 4,000 people from the pseudo-Red Army's 3rd Division and the Independent 3rd Division, via the Dabatou area in the southeast of Anyuan, attempted to rescue the bandit forces in Zun San Wei. Wang's division then dispatched more troops, led by Mo Dehong's regiment, to launch a fierce attack on the bandits in cooperation with Ling's regiment. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented since Wang's division arrived in San Nan. As a result, over 600 bandits were killed, one pseudo-regimental commander and two pseudo-battalion commanders were wounded, and dozens of pseudo-company and platoon leaders died. The bandits could not withstand the attack and began to flee towards places such as Shahanzi at 10 PM. In this battle, Ling and Mo's regiments of Wang's division also suffered considerable losses. The following telegram was received yesterday from Division Commander Wang: (1) At Yinshi on the day of the incident, a phone call was received from Regiment Commander Mo from Zhenkou, stating that the bandits fighting against us, due to repeated violent衝鋒 towards us, were threatened by our intense firepower and suffered extraordinarily heavy casualties, resulting in a complete collapse of their front line around 10 PM last night (the 29th). (2) We have dispatched the Zhang, Tan, and Liu battalions to search towards Dabatou. (3) Wang Xisheng, the secretary of the 7th Regiment of the pseudo-3rd Division, and Li Qingshan, the messenger, surrendered to our regiment this morning with a machine gun. According to their testimony, they originally served in the 52nd Division of the Central Army, but were captured and forced to join the army. They came to Anyuan this time from Ruijin, belonging to the pseudo-3rd Division. The pseudo-Independent Division and the 3rd Division were originally in Anyuan. The pseudo-22nd Division came from Tingzhou. Each division had a strength of two regiments and three battalions, with four companies in each battalion, reaching over a hundred people, totaling over 6,000 people. They all had good rifles and claimed to be recovering Anyuan and Xunwu, but in reality, they were attempting to create disturbances. In this battle, each regiment suffered over 200 casualties. Due to the unfavorable situation, they scattered and fled towards Sanheshui and Guanpu last night. They took the opportunity to escape, etc. Furthermore, Wang Zanbin stated in a telegram one day that, according to the report from Deputy Division Commander Zhou Quan, troops were dispatched this morning to search the battlefield near Tubatou again. Each battalion returned to the Shiqiaotangdong area at 3 PM in the afternoon. Approximately 600 bandit corpses were abandoned along the way, with countless wounded. It is rumored that some scattered bandits are hiding in the forests, etc. (August 3rd)</p>

<p>Last year, this county received an order to organize famine relief grain storage, collecting one jiao of silver per mu of land, collected along with the national tax, with separate receipts issued and collected, and a warehouse storage committee was established to purchase Xian grain and store it in separate warehouses. The committee sent a letter to the county government, requesting the Department of Civil Affairs to send personnel to Songjiang to inspect the grain in order to verify its accuracy. Subsequently, an order was received from the department, ordering compliance with Article 12 of the regulations for the management of local warehouses promulgated by the Ministry. Yesterday, the county government followed the regulations and invited representatives from local organizations, including County Magistrate Jin Tigan, Yang Zhimin from the County Chamber of Commerce, Li Xiuzhe from the Sijing Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Tianmin from the Tianma Chamber of Commerce, and warehouse committee members Ni Guangrong, Wu Qianmei, Wang Zhewu, Li Zuhua, and Zhang Siyong. County Magistrate Jin reported on the grain storage process, and then led the committee members and representatives to various warehouses to inspect the grain. It was verified that the original Xian grain, according to the Tanhu measurement, amounted to 1,849 shi and 5 dou, stored in eleven warehouses, which matched the numbers in the warehouse entry records. The grain was dry and showed no signs of pests, but needed to be frequently turned and aired for long-term storage.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Rickshaw Pullers' Strike Calmed Down <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The rickshaw trade association in this county revised the rickshaw rental fee to 3.7 jiao per rickshaw, which sparked a general strike by all rickshaw pullers in the county. Later, through fair mediation by both the Party and the government, they were persuaded to temporarily maintain the original state, and the situation slightly eased. Unexpectedly, the association freely issued a declaration of the importance of maintaining business operations, setting the standard at 4 jiao plus two copper coins. Therefore, the situation changed, and the rickshaw pullers still did not resume work. Later, the county government adopted decisive measures, such as immediately detaining and severely punishing rickshaw pullers who damaged rickshaws, and detaining and severely punishing rickshaw companies that did not release rickshaws or disrupted the trade, and also revoking their rickshaw licenses and ordering them to cease operations. After hearing the instructions, each rickshaw company and rickshaw puller immediately complied with the mediation intentions of the county magistrate, restored the usual practices, and agreed to resume work. At the same time, Qian Sunqing, the chairman of the Municipal Management Committee, believed that since the rickshaw trade association was preparing for reorganization, how could it arbitrarily convene a general meeting and collect rickshaw rentals of 3.7 jiao, seeking to implement a never-implemented proposal, inevitably taking advantage of the situation to please certain tradesmen and using it as a stepping stone for competitive elections. Yesterday, he specially sent a letter to the county government, requesting that the association, during the preparation for reorganization, should stop exercising its powers in accordance with customary practice, otherwise it should be dissolved to prevent someone from taking advantage of it and to quell local disputes. As for the rickshaw pullers intercepting rickshaws and coercing strikes, please strictly detain and punish them. Yesterday (8th) morning, the rickshaw pullers went to the rickshaw companies as usual to collect rickshaws and engaged in business peacefully. From Guangfu Gate to Jixiang Bridge Gongyun Bridge Railway Station, Wang Wei, the captain of the police brigade, and Wang Xiezhong, the chief of the second branch bureau in charge, ordered the police team to be armed and dispatched to maintain order. The rickshaw pullers were quiet as usual, quietly waiting for the Party and government to negotiate a compromise solution by the 16th of this month before resolving the matter again.</p>

He was recently found in Beijing by Jiang's uncle, Jin Pei, who apprehended him and handed him over to the Capital Police Department for custody. The Shanghai Special Court was notified by telegram. At that time, Wu Zhengrong, the Wuxi political and police chief, happened to be in Shanghai on official business. He immediately returned to Wuxi and reported to County Magistrate Yan to prepare a document and go to Beijing to welcome the suspects back for interrogation.</p>

County Magistrate Cai, considering that the suspect and the stolen goods were both present and that there was a confirmed confession, proposed a death sentence. The proposal was submitted to the provincial government for approval and was immediately approved. At noon on the 7th, the police were dispatched to bring the suspect to the court to verify his identity, and he was tied up and taken to the Fengweidun execution ground to be executed by firing squad.</p>

At around 8 PM on the 6th, two individuals suddenly entered, speaking with a Yancheng accent and wearing white cloth student uniforms, claiming to be exchanging foreign currency. They jumped into the counter, pulled out handguns, and threatened them not to make a sound. They ordered the manager, Cha Mingru, and the chief accountant, Kong Qi, to hand over the safe key. They then stole 107 yuan in paper money and 18 yuan in cash from the safe.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenhua, who ran a livestock brokerage in Guagua Township, the tenth district of the county, was kidnapped by bandits at the beginning of last month and a ransom of 2,000 yuan was demanded. Zhang's family, finding it difficult to raise such a large sum of money at once, repeatedly pleaded with the bandits for an extension. This angered the bandits. On the evening of the 3rd, they tied Zhang up with ropes, dragged him to the front of his house, tied him to a willow tree, and shot him to death. They also stuck a paper flag on Zhang's body with the inscription "If other hostages do not prepare the ransom, they will be treated in the same way."</p>

<p>In Daoshiguan, south of Guojiayuan, Shizhuang District, there is a Guo Kou who is addicted to tobacco and alcohol and does not engage in proper work. His mother, Wu, is already 77 years old. Because of her son's filial impiety, she had long harbored thoughts of ending her life. Last year, she attempted suicide behind people's backs because of an argument with her son, but it was unsuccessful. On the previous day (3rd), the mother and son suddenly had another argument over a minor matter. Wu thought to herself that she was over seventy years old and would die sooner or later. She secretly entered the change shed during lunchtime and hanged herself. By the time Guo Kou heard the news and went to save her, she had already stopped breathing. It was truly tragic.</p>

The second defendant, Xu Qinwen, and the witnesses, the maid Chen Zhugu and Qiu Benyuan, arrived on time. The judge first summoned Tao Sijin for questioning. Tao was wearing a light blue Indian silk qipao and her attitude was calm. She firmly denied premeditated murder, still claiming that she had no choice but to resist. She said that the murder weapon was seized from Liu Mengying's hand, etc. Xu Qinwen was then questioned and made a lengthy defense regarding the charge of interfering with the family. Next, witnesses Chen Zhugu and Biao Benyuan were questioned. Chen testified that she went to the New City Market to buy face cream and returned home. Qiu Benyuan was calling at the door, and then Xu Qinwen also came, etc. Finally, the lawyer hired jointly by Tao and Xu, Wang Shaogong, completed his defense.

<p>Made a Speech Before Leaving</p>
<p>Li Xiehe, who has been the most active in seeking an end to the Chahar incident, was specially invited by telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and took the Gonghe Wheel to Lu Shan last night (the 8th), via . Secretaries Zhu Haicha and Zhang Migong accompanied him. Before leaving, Li made the following speech: Since Mr. Feng's Dongri telegram ended the military actions and returned the political power, and the Dari telegram was issued, people in the government have expressed goodwill towards Huanzhang. Mr. Chiang's telegram this morning also referred to Huanzhang's expression of sincerity in seeking the nation's welfare. Huanzhang's actions have always been surprising, and his advances and retreats cannot be measured by ordinary people. Yesterday, Huanzhang telegraphed that Xiang has no difficulty in making concessions to the government, but he is particularly concerned that the Japanese are rampant and the government still has no way to respond to them. The people of the country have such a famous general, and the government should regard him as the Great Wall. However, the national crisis is urgent, and it is imperative to seek national stability. To seek national stability, we must first stabilize the people's hearts, so the implementation of open political power is still a fundamental issue. I am invited by special telegram from Mr. Chiang, so I plan to go to Lu Shan by wheel tonight to discuss the previous matter again, and also go to Beijing to present the details to the central government again.</p>
<h3 id="e115">French Occupation of Nine Small Islands in Southern Guangdong: City Party Headquarters Sends Telegram Requesting Serious Negotiations <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>To Achieve the Goal of Preserving Territory</p>
<p>Since France forcibly occupied nine small islands in southern Guangdong, which belong to our country, the city's Party headquarters telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting that the National Government conduct strict negotiations. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee and the National Government, with respect, the news that the French government has officially announced the occupation of the nine small islands in southern Guangdong, which are territories of our country, has come as a great shock. These nine small islands are located between the Philippines and Annam, and the surrounding waters are rich in aquatic products. They have long been inhabited by our country's fishermen. The fishermen of Fujian and Guangdong provinces gather here to make a living, with no fewer than tens of millions of households. Moreover, they are an important hub for navigation between Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, and are an essential route for the Eurasian route. They are of great importance in terms of military, commercial, and development considerations. The Guangdong Provincial Government has telegraphed Beijing to prove that these islands are south of Qiongyai and are indeed territories of our country. However, the French government is ambitious and, taking advantage of our internal and external troubles, openly occupied them to satisfy their private plans of gradual encroachment and whale devouring. This is indeed beyond the bounds of reason and law. The Japanese even think that these small islands are close to Taiwan and also vainly attempt to get their hands on them, claiming to retain their vested rights, which is even more absurd. Please supervise and urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct serious negotiations with the French government as soon as possible to achieve the goal of preserving territory, avoid the gradual encroachment of foreigners, and maintain sovereignty. We specially telegraphically request this. The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee, stamped."</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Has Filed a Protest Letter</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the boundary between the Chinese and French areas in Shanghai West was originally the Haig Road, but in recent years, whenever any incident occurs on Haig Road, the French Concession police authorities have gone to interfere. The municipal government believes that this matter constitutes an encroachment on Chinese police power by the French authorities. Therefore, a few days ago, Secretary Geng Jiaji was dispatched to the French Consul-General with a formal protest letter. It is now known that, in addition to replying in person, the French Consul-General will also provide a formal written reply within days.</p>

<p>Hualian News Agency reports that after Yano, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China, arrived in Shanghai, he immediately held meetings with Envoy Arima, Information Minister Suma, and Consul-General Ishii to study the methods of conducting diplomacy with China. It is heard that the Foreign Ministry sent telegram instructions to Envoy Arima: (1) Before Song Ziwen returns to the country, it is necessary to seek the Chinese government's understanding of the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomacy to a normal track. This understanding must have a solid guarantee. (2) Regarding the issue of recovering old debts, the military is advocating very strongly. Your Excellency must raise this with China. If the understanding shown in the previous article cannot be achieved, then make it clear that you reserve the right to take free action. (3) Regarding the part of the Japanese army that has not withdrawn in the war zone indicated in the North China Armistice Agreement, if the purpose shown in the first article can be achieved, the Japanese Foreign Ministry can guarantee the withdrawal of the Japanese army. (4) In the current situation, the Japanese government believes that maintaining the existing regime in North China is beneficial. It is necessary to clarify the Chinese government's true intentions on this point. (5) This negotiation must be kept strictly confidential. Nanjing and Beijing will both be subject to obstruction from Britain and the United States. Your Excellency must handle this carefully.</p>

<p>Assembly in Hangzhou Not Completed</p>
<p>Unable to Arrive as Scheduled</p>
<p>Location Decided to Be Changed to Hongqiao</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other five groups purchased five American Curtiss Hawk aircraft from the Chinese Aviation Association and named them Shanghai Business, Shanghai Industry, Shanghai Education, Shanghai Scout, and Ningbo. The naming ceremony was originally scheduled to be held on the 12th of this month at the Jiangwan Racecourse. According to Lin Wojiang, the secretary-general of the Aviation Association, it has now been postponed. This is because, after the five aircraft were shipped to Shanghai, they were transferred to the Hangzhou Aviation School for assembly due to the incompleteness of the assembly parts in Shanghai. I (Mr. Lin) personally went to Hangzhou on the 5th to inspect and found that the assembly had not yet been completed. It is estimated that it will not be completed as scheduled, so the date of the naming ceremony has to be postponed. We must wait until the assembly and test flight are completed before notifying all sectors to hold the naming test flight. As for the location, it has also been decided to change it to the Hongqiao Airport to avoid danger when the five aircraft take off and land simultaneously.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office Will Host the Press Today</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that the Palace Museum's southward-bound antiquities were previously inspected by an organized temporary supervisory committee and found that some of the furs were slightly damp. It is now known that the office has requested fur experts to re-examine the furs, and the result is that they were not damaged. The Shanghai office of the museum has scheduled a reception for journalists this afternoon to publicly report. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Re-examination of Furs Shows No Damage <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Huan, the chief of the office stationed in Shanghai by the museum, stated that when the boxes were opened previously, the furs were found to be damp, and a way should be found to dry them. However, for the sake of prudence, fur experts, Director Lu of the fur department of the Sincere Company, were specially invited to inspect them to determine the method. At 2 PM on the previous afternoon, the temporary supervisory committee was notified to send representatives to supervise the event, and Mr. Lu was invited to the ancient object storage location at 26 Tianzhutang Street. The two representatives of the supervisory committee and over ten assisting staff members were present. The treasurer, Cai Xianying, opened the vault and ordered the coolies to open the fur boxes. After Mr. Lu inspected them, the result was that he believed that there was no damage. The slight dampness previously discovered was because these furs were too old and tightly pressed in the boxes, causing a thin oil to be squeezed out of the leather, but this was a natural phenomenon and did not matter. It could not be considered dampness. Only four boxes were opened later, because they were all the same, so they were not opened further.</p>

It is heard that Ma Heng, the acting director of the museum, will also attend in person.</p>

<p>The Korean Elimination of Traitors Group announced the crimes of Yu Guanbin, a traitor. After Yu Guanbin was killed, the Korean community knew that his crimes had been filled to the brim and that there would be a day when he would be publicly punished. However, the general Chinese society did not understand the truth, and there was much discussion. We are responsible for this matter and now make a solemn statement: Our Korea is unfortunate. In the past, there were people like Li Wanyong and Song Bingjun, and now there is Yu Guanbin, a traitor. He not only causes trouble to our country, but also harms China. This is something that we are very ashamed and sorry for to our beloved Chinese compatriots.</p>

<p>Hoping that Song Zheyuan Will Return to Chahar Soon to Take Over Everything</p>
<p>Ma Xiangbo and Zhang Taiyan Jointly Telegraph Feng to Express Condolences</p>
<p>Since Feng Yuxiang issued the Dari telegram, returning the military and political power to the central government, the situation in North China has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Based on the current situation, it can be observed that the Chahar Bureau can be resolved satisfactorily in the shortest possible time. The news obtained yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e124">Telegram Ending Military Actions <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang sent a telegram on the day of the song ending military actions: (Title omitted) Previously received congratulatory telegrams from Mr. Wang Jingwei and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. I sincerely replied in the World Day telegram. Yuxiang vowed to resist Japan to the death, originally hoping to sacrifice externally and cleanse the national humiliation. If this instead leads to the government army's campaign to suppress, causing civil war, then it is not only what Yuxiang does not want to see, but also what the people of the country cannot bear to hear. Alas, today's China is in extreme danger. The rivers and mountains are fragmented, and disasters are constantly occurring. It is a time when the people of the country are in the same boat, facing the storm, sharing life and death. How can we allow brothers to fight each other, creating opportunities for fishermen, further plunging the nation into eternal damnation? Yuxiang loves the country and will never use those who save the country to mislead it. Yuxiang loves the people and will never use those who love the people to harm them. Now I am willing to make the rights and wrongs public to all generations. From today onwards, I painfully end the military actions, returning the political power to the government and the territory to the people of the country. I also ask the government to immediately order Song Zheyuan, the original chairman of Chahar Province, to return to Chahar soon to take over everything and handle the aftermath. Yuxiang has raised the banner of justice for 70 days. The power to serve the country has been exhausted, and the wish to recover the territory has not been fulfilled. I am deeply ashamed that I cannot comfort the hopes of the people of the country, but the determination to resist Japan and cleanse the national humiliation becomes stronger with each setback. As long as there is a breath left, this will will not change. This is what I can be confident in. Feng Yuxiang, song,</p>

<p>Ma Xiangbo, an elder of ninety-four years, and others, yesterday</p>
<p>sent two telegrams, one addressed to Feng Yuxiang,</p>
<p>and the other to Song Zheyuan. The texts are recorded as</p>
<p>follows: (1) To (abbreviated) Your Excellency: You have sworn</p>
<p>that guns will not be turned inward. You have heeded mediation, and Mingxuan has taken over, a trusted successor. Great faith remains. Losing the military but gaining trust, there is no disadvantage to Your Excellency. The situation is difficult, and the country is in danger of collapse. Though you have retired, it is not yet time to ride a donkey and grow vegetables. May your old steed possess a valiant heart, not growing disheartened in the stable. Ma Liang, Zhang Binglin, Qi. (2) To General Song Mingxuan of Zhangjiakou: Your victory at Xifeng is the greatest achievement of all armies. Now, succeeding Huan Gong, you follow his policies, enjoying popular support. But to say that Chahar Province is already secure is not true. Be vigilant, be vigilant. Those who congratulate are at the door, but those who mourn are in the lane. Ma Liang, Zhang Binglin.</p>
<p>Whose viciousness was extreme. Hu Lifu, who took advantage of the chaos during the January 28th Shanghai Incident to commit atrocities, was long ago executed in Suzhou. However, Yu Guanbin, who had acted as a lackey and running dog for many years, still resides peacefully in Shanghai. His treacherous and unpredictable methods have become even more severe. Therefore, we feel compelled by our mission of justice to no longer tolerate him. Thus, we assassinated him at the beginning of this month, eliminating this traitor to both Korea and China. A brief account of his history and the reasons for his execution are listed below: Yu Guanbin, also known as Xin Dao, was from Pingan South Province, Korea, and a disciple of Yu Chengbin, a current detective in the Shanghai French Concession police force. Later, when he became a Chinese citizen, he changed his name to Hui Guan. In his youth, he was intelligent and sociable. Before the age of twenty, he engaged in patriotic activities, earning a reputation and being called a young patriot. However, he came to the attention of the enemy and was briefly imprisoned. After his release, he surrendered to the enemy. (1) Upon his release, the Governor-General of Korea secretly ordered the Governor of Pingan South Province to instruct Tomita Gisaku, the manager of the Sanwa Bank in Zhennampo, Pingan South Province, to ostensibly appoint him as the bank's manager, but secretly have him investigate the internal affairs of patriotic activists. When the Korean independence movement erupted in 1919, Korean revolutionaries gathered in Shanghai. The Governor-General's office secretly sent Yu to Shanghai to investigate the truth. This was discovered by his traveling companion, Du Yinquan, who secretly informed the Korean Provisional Government. The government planned to execute him, but Yu found out and went into hiding in the British Concession. (The government repeatedly tried to carry out the execution, but failed until today.) This crime is punishable by death. (2) Under the guise of trade, he opened the Lide Trading Company, swindling money from many Korean businessmen. Later, the company was renamed the American Sande Trading Company, directly under the command of Oda Mitsuru, the Shanghai representative of the Governor-General of Korea, to investigate matters concerning China and Korea. This crime is punishable by death. (3) At the beginning of the renaming of Sande Trading Company, he formed a partnership with a Chinese man named Lu, swindling over ten thousand taels of silver. Fearing that Lu would reveal his secret intelligence work, he drove Lu away. This crime is punishable by death. (4) With the enemy's financial support, he secretly printed the Innovation Daily and many other anonymous leaflets, specifically to incite discord among Korean revolutionaries, in order to disrupt our movement's progress and to use various means such as inducements or threats to make revolutionaries defect to the enemy. This crime is punishable by death. (5) He investigated the whereabouts of revolutionaries traveling between Korea, China, and Japan, and plotted their arrest. (The arrest of the Confucian representative, Kim Chang-suk, was also Yu's doing.) This crime is punishable by death. (6) When obtaining Chinese citizenship as a Korean, he did not say he was becoming a citizen, but rather that he was regaining citizenship (falsely claiming to be from Kunming, Yunnan), in order to gain the trust of the Chinese people. After joining the Chinese Kuomintang, he used the enemy's secret funds to frequently host banquets and connect with people in the name of supporting public welfare, secretly investigating the military and political affairs of China. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, he devoted himself to investigating Chinese military intelligence for the enemy. This crime is punishable by death. (7) As a result of supplying military supplies to the enemy (timber for trenches, worth over ten thousand yuan, and a car), he received a reward from the enemy's military department. Yu's residence on Tongji Road was in the war zone, so he hoisted the enemy flag to ensure his safety. This crime is punishable by death.</p>
<p>(8) Recently, under the orders of Arakaki, the Japanese Minister of the Army, from the Kokusuikai (National Essence Society), he bought off unruly elements wandering in the Hongkou area to form a gang, taking advantage of our restricted movement since the Hongkou bombing case last year, and planning to assassinate all revolutionaries. This crime is punishable by death. (9) Protected by the enemy, he lives peacefully in the British Concession and carries a pistol issued by the enemy consulate, constantly flaunting his status, without any sense of shame. This crime is punishable by death. The above-mentioned items are only the major and prominent ones. Even if there were only one of them, his crime could not be pardoned, let alone so many? The day after the traitor was killed, many police officers from the enemy consulate went to the French Concession police station early in the morning and requested his body, which was taken away. This alone shows that he was a highly valued lackey and running dog for the enemy during his lifetime. August, 1933, Korean Anti-Traitor Group.</p>

After the September 18th Incident, General Ma took the lead in the anti-Japanese resistance. Deng participated in the battle. During the Nenjiang Bridge Battle, he served as the cavalry regiment commander. During the Battle of Songpu, he was promoted to commander of the First Army by General Ma. Deng then led his troops to fight in Rehe and Chahar. The central government sent personnel to reorganize the troops and specially appointed him as the commander of the 10th Cavalry Division of the Vanguard Army, temporarily under the command of Liu Yifei. In total, Deng had followed General Ma for more than ten years, with outstanding achievements. His sudden assassination has caused deep mourning throughout the country.</p>

Deng's followers were unable to return fire in time and failed to retaliate. Deng was shot seven times and died, a very tragic death. The murderers escaped on the spot. The cause of the assassination is unknown. Feng has allocated funds for the funeral and the arrest of the murderers after hearing the news. Deng's former position is now temporarily held by Tan Zixin.</p>

<h3 id="e131">American Reporter Isaac Goes to Japan <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Attracting Japanese Attention</p>
<p>The "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reports that Isaac, the editor of "The China Forum", departed for Japan yesterday (the 7th) with his wife on the Nagasaki Maru, planning to visit Nagasaki and its vicinity for a summer vacation. Before his departure, Mr. Isaac told a friend that this trip was solely for rest and recuperation, and that he did not wish to meet anyone in Japan. However, considering that the American black poet Hughes, who was staying at Isaac's home a few days ago, was expelled from Japan on the 25th of last month due to his inspection of political matters in China and Soviet Russia, Isaac may also encounter difficulties in Japan because he is in charge of "The China Forum". Furthermore, according to the Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" in this city, Isaac's sudden trip to Japan is related to the Anti-Imperialist Congress held in Shanghai, because the Japanese delegates have not yet been selected, and Isaac received a secret telegram inviting him to Japan to participate in discussions on the selection of Japanese delegates. According to another source, Isaac had to temporarily flee to Japan because he published his so-called assassination plan. The Japanese Consulate General in this city, upon hearing the news of Isaac's trip to Japan, immediately telegraphed the Nagasaki authorities, asking them to pay attention to the investigation. However, Isaac's friends believe that the newspaper's statement is not true, saying that his trip to Japan had been planned for several weeks and was not a temporary decision, and that it had nothing to do with the two incidents mentioned. According to what we know, Isaac carries an American passport with proper visas, so there should be no problems at the time of entry, but during his stay in Japan, he will likely be followed by Japanese detectives.</p>

<h3 id="e133">International Problems Research Association Invited Dr. Liang Yunli to Give a Lecture Yesterday <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Recent Developments in International Affairs and the Sino-Japanese Incident</p>
<p>Dr. Liang Yunli, former Special Commissioner to the League of Nations Assembly and current Councilor of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, was invited by the Shanghai International Problems Research Association to give a lecture at the association at 5:00 PM yesterday (the 8th) on his recent impressions in Geneva. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>Last year, I gave a speech in the United States on the international political and legal significance of the Sino-Japanese problem. In October, our delegation, with the Lytton Report, submitted it to the special assembly to be held in November for discussion. The international situation became increasingly tense. There were many aspects of the problem of the Northeastern Provinces that needed legal clarification, so I specifically telegraphed the United States inviting me to go to Geneva to assist. I arrived in Geneva in mid-November, at which time the League of Nations Executive Yuan was preparing to begin its meeting. People from various countries who were interested in international problems flocked to Geneva to observe. Since the Treaty of Versailles, there has been no international political event that has attracted more attention from experts and the general public than this one. This is not only because whether the League of Nations can continue to prolong its existence depends on the resolution of the Northeastern Provinces Incident, but also because whether the global movement for peace and anti-war that has spread throughout the world since the Great War has any significance and needs to continue depends on whether the Japanese can be sanctioned by world opinion as a touchstone. From my personal perspective, the heated attention given to the Northeastern Provinces Incident in terms of public opinion is far greater than that received by the governments of various countries. Most governments (especially the governments of the so-called "Great Powers") have the mentality of appeasement, turning big problems into small ones, and small problems into nothing, because their own practical interests have not been severely damaged by this. The statements made by British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Peng Gu all recognized the Northeastern Provinces Incident as a local incident, with no direct relationship to general world politics. But this is their external rhetoric. In fact, they are engaged in a power struggle, and their attempts to exempt Japan from responsibility have never ceased. Simon, on the one hand, insisted at the disarmament conference that Germany should abide by the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant regarding military reduction, and on the other hand, excused Japan's actions in violating the Covenant. The obvious contradiction in his policy is obvious to all. However, in order to conceal his contradiction, Simon greatly advocated the theory that Japan's military actions in China were not "war" in the sense of international law. In fact, the views of international legal scholars on this point have changed greatly. What Simon advocates is only a one-sided view, with purely political reasons behind it, and is not accepted by new-school jurists. The indifference of the great powers towards the Northeastern Provinces Incident has remained unchanged. Although the special assembly passed the report of the Committee of Nineteen this spring, this resolute measure of the League of Nations to condemn Japan should not be said to be a change in the attitude of the great powers of Britain and France, but rather a result of pressure from world public opinion. In Britain, France, and especially the United States, all institutions that study international problems, such as our International Problems Research Association, are deeply sorry for the incompetence of the League of Nations. Among them, there are also clear expressions that they will stop supporting the League of Nations if the League of Nations dares not even impose theoretical and moral sanctions on Japan. For example, the British League of Nations Association (a private organization) and the American Foreign Policy Association (also a private organization) have all made clear statements regarding Japan's violation of the Covenant. This is a clear phenomenon in international politics, and can give us a sense of comfort.</p>
<p>The achievements of our delegation in Geneva over the past year have been disclosed in the newspapers from time to time, so I won't repeat them here. After the assembly passed the report of the Committee of Nineteen in February of this year, the atmosphere in Geneva changed from tension to depression. Although there was a disarmament conference, from the perspective of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the effectiveness of the League of Nations seemed to have ended here. I recently heard that the report of the "Advisory Committee" established by the assembly on not recognizing "Manchukuo" has been published. All newspapers have published it in recent days, but this report will definitely not have the effect we hope for if it is not followed by the economic sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Apart from the principle of "non-recognition," which only has a slight force in the negative aspect, it is of no help in stopping aggression. Moreover, as time passes, the great powers are obsessed with their own interests, and even this principle may not be strictly adhered to. Recently, there have been news of Japanese bandits invading North China. At this time of military tension, it is ridiculous to only engage in the formulation of negative principles.</p>
<p>My personal view is that our country should always advocate submitting Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant at an appropriate time. Some say that in order to submit this article, our country must declare war or break off diplomatic relations. I believe that from a purely legal point of view, these two conditions are not necessary. What Article 16 prohibits is "acts of war" rather than a "state of war." Some international jurists make a distinction between "acts" and "states." I believe that the fundamental concept of modern international law tends towards the dynamic aspect, focusing on the control of various acts, rather than the consistency of abstract logic. What the Covenant prohibits is actual acts of war, not the state of war recognized by traditional international law. I have discussed this issue many times. On my way back to China, I wrote an article for the August issue of "Shen Bao Monthly," which also pointed out the misunderstanding of this point by the general public.</p>
<p>Because of the weakness of the League of Nations in handling the Northeastern Provinces Incident, it has turned its attention to engaging in technical cooperation with our country. This may not be "losing mulberry in the east but gaining it in the west." The function of the League of Nations is divided into two parts: one is to prevent war, and the other is to promote cooperation. The former is more difficult, and the latter is easier. But if the latter has remarkable results, the existence of the League of Nations has considerable justification. We should not have great expectations for international organizations. Our policy should be to exhaust the effectiveness of these opportunities. All countries attach considerable importance to the League of Nations. Conducting diplomacy in Geneva does not mean that weak countries have no chance of success. In 1924 and 1925, Germany's power had declined to the extreme, but because of the resourceful means and far-sightedness of Foreign Minister Stresemann in Geneva, Germany was invited to join the League of Nations in 1926, and its international status also improved rapidly. Currently, all important countries have diplomats with high qualifications and prestige permanently stationed in Geneva. I believe that if our country wants to continue Geneva diplomacy, it should choose those with a global perspective and specialized knowledge of international politics to be permanently stationed there to interact with the representatives of Britain and France. Mr. Wu Tiyun had repeatedly expressed this idea when he was the representative. I believe that the International Problems Research Association should find ways to connect with organizations with the same goals in Britain and the United States in order to achieve the goal of effectively influencing international public opinion. US Senator Borah said that in order for government actions to be effective, public opinion must be constantly whipped. If there are unsatisfactory aspects of international organizations, we should not hesitate to whip them to make them aware of the need for caution. I hope that the International Problems Research Association can use its whips frequently.</p>

<p>Lacking Food and Ammunition, Besieged</p>
<p>The Shanghai Liaison Office of the Third Route Army of the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army recently received a telegram from its commander, Wang Gongjue, stating that the First and Second Southern Detachments are currently stationed in Jing'an Fort, Feng Wang Kou, Yongning Cheng and its vicinity near Chicheng, holding key positions for defense. Suddenly, two enemy planes came and dropped eight bombs, but only three exploded. The Detachment Commander Wan Kecheng shot down an injured enemy plane with a Russian-style machine gun. That night at dawn, the enemy launched a large-scale attack, intending to eliminate our army. The troops of the First Detachment, Yang Zhifu's department, fought bravely, fighting fiercely for two days and nights, but the enemy did not succeed. Due to the lack of food and ammunition, the enemy took the opportunity to surround them, and the situation was very intense. They telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Zhu for instructions. During the hand-to-hand combat, they personally led the Broadsword Team and the Special Service Detachment, taking the enemy's rear road, and broke through the encirclement. In this battle, our army suffered more than 300 casualties, including the death of Company Commander Wu Changtai, Company Adjutant Zhong Qi, Zhang Desheng, Zuo Dacai, and Platoon Leader Li Shilin, Chen Shizhong, Hu Ying, and Jin Qichang. The enemy also suffered heavy casualties and captured more than 70 rifles, five automatic rifles, and one heavy machine gun. They are now jointly defending with Yin Bohong's department of the Fifth Route Army to resist the enemy's attack.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Hu Xiyuan Requests Establishment of a Tungsten Refining Plant <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>A Document Presented to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Tungsten is tough, not easily dissolved, and a very important mineral in modern industry. When refined into wire, it emits light when an electric current is passed through it, and can replace the platinum wire used in the past. Therefore, it is a basic raw material for the manufacture of light bulbs. China is very rich in tungsten, but the Chinese people do not know how to refine it, so they rely on foreigners and lose their rights to profits. Recently, the Ministry of Industry of our country has established a Tungsten Mine Production and Sales Bureau, but it only pays attention to the export of raw materials and does not try to refine it itself. Hu Xiyuan, General Manager of China Yabu Er Electric Appliance Factory, noting the difficulty and danger that China cannot refine tungsten itself, specifically submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating the importance of refining tungsten wire by itself. Excerpts from the original text are as follows: (Omitted above) I have found that tungsten wire is the main raw material for various weapons, machinery, and electrical appliances. China produces 80% of the world's tungsten, and the output of the Gan Nan region alone accounts for 10% of the country. Because the Chinese people have not set up factories for refining, foreigners buy raw materials every year, and after they are refined in their countries, they are sold back to China. The quantity recorded in the customs import register is shocking, and the national foundation is in danger. Recently, I read a report that your Ministry has a proposal to establish a Tungsten Mine Production and Sales Bureau, so the production and sales channels will be supervised and guided, and there will be a path to follow, and the exploitation of profit sources is deeply admirable. However, with such abundant production and such important raw materials, if we do not set up factories to refine them ourselves, then we still have to rely on foreigners for military equipment and industrial manufacturing. With one transfer between export and import, foreigners enjoy the profits, and China's losses are huge. Once there is a war, the source is cut off, and not only will industrial manufacturing be extremely difficult, but I am afraid that military equipment will not be able to be rescued. Thinking of this, I am terrified. The plan for now is to make preparations in advance. I would like to ask your Ministry to plan to set up factories and establish a century-long plan for a fundamental solution. The beginning is certainly difficult, but one effort can be permanent.

<h3 id="e138">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram to Ministry of Finance Requesting Exemption from Supplementary Tobacco Tax <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Supporting Cotton Yarn Consolidated Tax Precedent to Issue Inventory Certificates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, saying: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: This Chamber received a letter on the 7th of this month from the Tobacco Trade Association, stating that since 1930, the tobacco industry has been in decline, with inventories piling up and unable to be sold. As of now, there are still 16,500 unsold cases of aged domestic tobacco leaves stored in this port, mainly from Anhui's Susong, Henan's Dengxian, Jiangxi's Guangfeng, Zhejiang's Xinchang, Tongxiang, and Hubei's Huanggang and Yunxian. The reasons for the stagnation of sales are roughly as follows: (1) The cigarette tax was changed from a three-tier system to a two-tier system. Cigarette factories found it unprofitable to produce low-grade cigarettes and switched to producing mid-grade cigarettes. Aged tobacco leaves were previously used as raw materials for low-grade cigarettes. Since cigarette factories stopped producing low-grade cigarettes, aged tobacco leaves could not be sold. (2) Domestic tobacco leaves were once popular in the Northeast and Korea. Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has been occupied, industry and commerce have ceased, and war has raged. The tobacco business in that area has been completely cut off. Tobacco leaves previously shipped to Korea now have to pass through Dalian into the puppet state via Shanghai due to the seizure of the Northeast Customs by the puppet state. The customs duties require five or six taels per picul of tobacco leaves, making it uneconomical due to price concerns, so no one is buying. (3) Foreign countries have increased import duties on tobacco leaves and encouraged people to grow tobacco to resist the import of Chinese tobacco. Therefore, in recent years, foreign firms have experienced very slow business. These domestic tobacco leaves, accumulated over the years, have changed in quality due to prolonged storage, and their prices have plummeted. Added to this are storage rent and all other expenses, resulting in huge losses. In recent years, some businesses in the industry have closed down due to economic pressure, and some have gone bankrupt due to excessive losses. Even those who are fortunate enough to barely maintain their operations are in a state of hardship that cannot be described in words. The Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has now promulgated regulations on special taxes for domestic tobacco leaves, stipulating that if domestic tobacco leaves stored in this port are transported to other ports, new taxes must be paid, and the old taxes already paid will be refunded. However, the old tobacco sales fees vary from province to province, but are all lower than the current new tax of 4.15 yuan per 100 catties. According to the regulations of the tax authorities, the more expensive tobacco leaves will have to pay an additional five or six yuan in new taxes per picul, and the cheaper ones will have to pay seven or eight jiao. Our industry, after years of losses, really cannot bear any further burden. We propose that your association appeal to the tax authorities to give special consideration to the difficulties of businesses and maintain the tobacco industry. For aged domestic tobacco leaves on which public sales fees have already been paid, whether sold in this port or shipped for export, we request that no new taxes be levied and that the Tax Bureau issue aged tobacco sales and transportation certificates for identification and facilitating sales. We respectfully request your association's vigorous assistance and thorough arrangements, which will be appreciated by all." Upon arrival at the association, it was found that the industry's accumulated tobacco leaves were all due to sluggish sales and inability to sell, and the storage rent and interest paid over the years were already considerable. If they are again required to pay the newly promulgated special tax with a higher tax rate and refund the public sales fee with a lower rate, then merchants will suffer another loss between the payment and the refund. Moreover, as with the initial implementation of the consolidated tax on cotton yarn, there was a deadline for clearing inventory, and inventory certificates were issued upon export to exempt them from the consolidated tax. It seems inappropriate to be uniquely biased against the special tax on tobacco leaves. We hereby submit a telegram to your esteemed ministry for review and approval, requesting that you grant the association's request to issue certificates for the transportation and sale of stored tobacco leaves and exempt them from the special tax, which would be in the public interest. respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Chinese Medical Association Presents to Legislative Yuan President Sun <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Rejection of the National Medical Institute Regulations</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association yesterday submitted a presentation to the Legislative Yuan regarding the National Medical Institute and the Ministry of Health, stating: "Presenting a request: It is found that China's medical facilities have long lagged behind, and the annual mortality rate is several times higher than that of advanced countries in the East and West. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has regarded improving public health as an important task and established a special Ministry of Health to manage national medical administration. Although the ministry was later changed to a department, the scope of administration and its efficiency have not been reduced as a result. Since the establishment of the central health administrative organ, health construction has been carried out without reservation. Here, the association will present to your esteemed Yuan the most obvious examples. During the floods of the year before last, the Battle of Shanghai last year, and the war in North China this spring, health personnel participated in every battle, and many were saved by epidemic prevention and rescue. When epidemics spread in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Health and local organs cooperated closely, and each achieved success. In addition, the establishment of central hospitals, the dissemination of health knowledge, the establishment of medical management, and the efforts to awaken the public are all obvious to everyone. It is not easy to achieve such results in a short period of time. However, in July of the 20th year, the Central National Medical Institute was established, with the aim of reorganizing and improving national medicine using scientific methods. However, in the two years since then, there has not been the slightest improvement in national medicine, and suddenly a regulation on the management of national medicine has been formed, which is ridiculous. The association, upon hearing this, earnestly believes that it is not possible. Central administration should have unified organs. Departments such as education and transportation each have specialized duties, and departments and sections are set up to cooperate and form a system. Hygiene management is no exception. In the past, Japanese Han medicine and Western medicine were opposed to each other. The government advocated science, weighed the pros and cons, and also used those who conformed to science to administer. Now, if our country wants to manage new doctors as one organ and old doctors as another, it will be like building a house on top of another house. How can we unify power? If the National Medical Institute is truly scientific, then the Ministry of Health should be abolished, and national health and medicine should be managed by the National Medical Institute. If the Ministry of Health is scientific, then the National Medical Institute should be abolished, and national health and medicine should be managed by the Ministry of Health. Moreover, the National Medical Institute itself also admits that it is unscientific, because its purpose is to use scientific methods to reorganize and improve our country's inherent medicine, which shows that it does not conform to science and wants to be scientific. Whether it can be transformed is still a question. Even if it does, it should be subordinate to the scientific Ministry of Health for improvement. It should not blindly use a non-scientific group to hope to become scientific, so that it can be a separate system. Let's take the so-called improved national medicine as an example. Some people learn anatomy in school, some people learn physiology, some people use Western methods to inject when they start a business, and some people use thermometers. Are they Chinese or Western? Will they be managed by the National Medical Institute or by the Ministry of Health? Or will a third organ be set up to manage them? Let's take Chinese medicine as an example. Chinese medicine such as ephedra is boiled with boiling water as a Chinese method, and its components are extracted as a Western method, but its effects are the same. Then, such as rhubarb, boiled with boiling water is a Chinese method, and extracted with alcohol and water is a Western method. To the extent of exhausting the categories, there is no end. May I ask whether these medicines should be managed by the National Medical Institute or by the Ministry of Health? Or will a third organ be set up to manage them? Conflicts of authority, unclear boundaries, hygiene management, a mess. The simultaneous existence of a non-scientific organ and a scientific organ introduces a detour when the national people's concept of science is still young and fragile. What is the danger? The association's heart is in danger, and it dare not speak. We respectfully request that your esteemed Yuan examine the facts, weigh the pros and cons, and reject the National Medical Institute Regulations, and not allow its establishment. The future of hygiene depends on it. This presentation is to Sun, President of the Legislative Yuan. Niu Huisheng, President of the Chinese Medical Association."</p>
<h3 id="e140">Various Wine Industry Associations Appeal for Amendments to the New System <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Slight Increase in Burden Endured Painfully</p>
<p>Strict Regulations Vowed Not to Be Recognized</p>
<p>The local yellow wine, Shaoxing wine, sauce wine, Liang shochu, and sauce garden trade associations in this city, all feeling that the tax bureau's implementation of the fixed tax on local wine is oppressing business and making it impossible to maintain operations, have successively announced the suspension of remittances and brewing. The joint meeting decided the day before yesterday to submit a letter to party and government organs, the All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Joint Association, and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, appealing for amendments. The original text is recorded as follows: "Presenting a statement clarifying that the new tax on local wine is too burdensome, causing various industries to suffer oppression and suspend transportation and brewing, respectfully requesting your esteemed meeting and bureau to quickly request amendments to eliminate disputes and maintain business. The member associations and other trades have been paying wine tax for various types of wine for many years, nominally as public sales fees, levied at 20% of the value, with production taxes collected separately in two places. Local wine without sales behavior is not taxed in advance, which has been convenient for merchants and people for nearly 20 years. However, since July 1st of this year, the tax bureau has changed the regulations, abolished public sales, and separately stipulated a fixed tax on local wine, totaling eight chapters and forty articles. The articles are burdensome, the procedures are cumbersome, the penalty rules are severe, and manufacturers must pay full taxes on wine in storage that is not involved in sales and obtain a tax certificate, otherwise it will be treated as private production and sales, confiscated, and severely punished. The various industries feel oppressed and unable to maintain operations. Forced to do so, the member associations of Shaoxing wine, local yellow wine, and sauce wine have successively suspended transportation and brewing after voting by the members' congress to show their determination. The member associations of Liang shochu and sauce gardens, feeling that the lips are cold when the teeth are lost, can only continue to convene members' congresses to make representations, which are generally nothing more than shutting down. The implementation of this new tax is indeed annihilating business. The member associations solicited opinions from members, who all agreed that a slight increase in the burden could be endured painfully, but they vowed not to recognize the strict regulations. Moreover, the cancellation of the special stamp for local yellow wine (i.e., half-tax stamp) is cutting off livelihoods and is particularly severe. The overall attitude is consistent. Therefore, the member associations are of the opinion that the new regulations should be amended as appropriate so that the tax is fair and business is convenient, those who have suspended operations can resume operations, and those who have not suspended operations can be at peace. The advantages and disadvantages are obvious. In addition to submitting a presentation to the Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Department, we hereby submit a presentation with the association's seal, respectfully requesting that your esteemed chairman examine and verify, uphold justice, and request that the tax authorities amend the new regulations as appropriate, announce them to all, so as to eliminate disputes and maintain business, for which we will be extremely grateful."</p>

On the 18th of this month, we received a letter from the Qin Ci Yang Dian Temple Management Committee, stating: "We received your letters dated April 8th and April 14th, requesting that we report the income from the Incense Money from Qin Ci Yang Dian Temple for forwarding." In response, we found that the income from the Incense Money from Qin Ci Yang Dian Temple was 2,711 yuan silver for the whole year after inviting bids last year. How to spend it was previously ordered by the Municipal Government to prepare a budget for verification. On May 15th, we convened all the committee members for a special meeting at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. After discussion, we decided to allocate 20% for operating expenses, 20% for annual repairs, and because Pudong Hospital was short of funds, we requested a subsidy, so we allocated 30% to subsidize the annual expenses of Pudong Hospital. The remaining 30% was initially proposed to be used for relief, disability, and burial, each accounting for 10%. Because your office's letter mentioned that the construction of school buildings at Yangjing Junior High School was insufficient, and requested that the incense money be transferred, we convened another meeting on June 20th, deciding to allocate the original 30% for relief to subsidize the construction costs of Yangjing Junior High School, starting from this year and limited to five years. After the expiration of the limit, we will continue to follow the original proposal. Is it appropriate? We have prepared a letter for forwarding for approval and record, in order to comply, and express our public friendship." (omitted) Based on this, we hereby submit a report with the facts, requesting your review and approval. Based on this, we hereby submit a report with the facts, requesting your review and approval. We previously received reports from the association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Education Association of the Fifth District, which were instructed to investigate the facts separately. Now, according to the previous situation, the verification is still feasible. In addition to the instructions, we hereby instruct the bureau to notify and instruct. This order."</p>

<p>Catholic Action Association Hosts Welcome Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>Led by Lu Yingen to Inspect England, Germany, and France</p>
<p>The National Catholic Pilgrimage to Rome, organized by Chinese Catholic laymen, consisting of 30 people, set off on the Italian Conte Verde on May 12th. They were warmly welcomed by local church groups in Hong Kong, Singapore, etc. They arrived in Rome on June 5th and were warmly greeted by people from their homeland. After staying in Italy for two weeks, they went to France, Belgium, and Switzerland to successively worship and visit various places of interest and major factories. They were sincerely entertained everywhere, which is a glorious history of our country's contribution. It is learned that the pilgrimage group returned to China from Italy on the Conte Rosso yesterday. The welcome along the way was even greater than before. At 9 o'clock yesterday morning, the ship arrived in port. Lu Bohong, the president of the National Catholic Action Association, together with all the members, hired a motorboat to go to the Qichang Wharf to board the ship to welcome them. They took the boat to the New Customs Wharf and sent the group members by prepared cars to churches, homes, or hotels. Among those returning home this time were Bishop Cui, Father Cui, Father Li, and Zhang Hanru, Deng Weiping, Wei Shangwu, Sun Zishou, Nie Xingwu, Nie Guoping, Zhu Zuoting, Zhou Bochang, Yu Xinzhu, Yu Yu, etc. It is heard that the leader, Lu Yingen, will go to Jerusalem for pilgrimage and inspect industry, charity, education, and shipping in England, Germany, and Austria. Lu is young and handsome, and has an enterprising mind. He will make a contribution to his father's career when he returns to China in the future. Last night, the Catholic Action Association hosted a welcome banquet for the pilgrimage group at the association's office, and invited Xia Xiangfu from Dongjiadu Catholic Church to accompany them. More than 200 guests attended. During the banquet, Zhang Hanru, the president of the Tianjin Yishi Newspaper, a member of the pilgrimage group, reported on all the details of the pilgrimage, and described the sincerity of Pope Pius XI's love for the Chinese people, which made people feel extremely tearful.</p>

<p>Good Deeds of the Medical Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Association sent a letter to the New Drug Association yesterday, saying, "Our association, feeling that the poor and sick in Shanghai cannot afford to seek medical treatment, specially resolved to launch a campaign to provide free medical treatment to the poor and sick through a general meeting. Volunteer members in the association will be responsible for sending out consultation coupons to the poor and sick. These consultation coupons have been printed and will be distributed soon. It is found that the cost of medicine needed for prescriptions in Shanghai is definitely not affordable for the general poor and sick who receive free medical treatment. Therefore, the executive committee of our association has requested that the members of our association mark the words 'poor and sick' on the prescriptions they prescribe. We hope that you will provide medicines according to the original prescriptions to help the poor and sick. As it concerns charity, we hope you will agree. We hereby inform you and ask you to notify the pharmacies to do so as soon as possible, which will be a great meritorious deed."</p>

Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the first criminal court to interrogate them. First, the defendant was asked his name, age, origin, occupation, residence, and whether he had committed any crimes before. The defendant stated that his name was Bratopiel Gongsiding, 20 years old, Russian, serving in the French police station as a patrolman, living in the Fuxu police station, and had never committed any crimes before. After the interrogation, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that on the afternoon of the 6th of this month, two patrol policemen, namely the defendant No. 91 and No. 106, and the Chinese policeman No. 98, patrolled to the New Kai River on the Bund and turned back north, passing by the Taikoo No. 4 Wharf and saw several.</p>

<p>Gambling, Chinese and Western police</p>
<p>coming forward to expel,</p>
<p>victim, Liu Mingshan,</p>
<p>was present, and his companions Gu Hongsheng and Yang Akun were also sitting nearby. Seeing the patrol officers coming forward to expel them, the victim stood up and fled eastward, causing him to lose his footing and fall into the river. Gu Hongsheng attempted to rescue him, and Liu Mingshan also fell into the river. Later, dockworkers rescued Gu, but they were unable to rescue Liu, who died. The body has now been recovered and examined by the prosecutor, who found no injuries on Liu's body, indicating that he died from drowning. The police department believes the defendant is suspected of negligence causing death and is now prosecuting him under Article 291 of the criminal law, requesting the court to investigate, etc.</p>
<p>Photographs of the scene taken by the police were also presented to the court. The judge asked Russian Constable No. 91 how Liu Mingshan fell into the river.</p>
<p>The constable replied that he was patrolling Huangpu Bund that night with No. 64 and Chinese constables.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Turning South and Returning North <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>They saw floating, on the wharf,</p>
<p>many people, gambling</p>
<p>and arguing, so they immediately</p>
<p>went forward together to expel them, shouting at them to disperse from about ten steps away. Then he saw the victim tripped by a rope or iron chain on a pile and fell into the river. Asked if he had gone to capture them, he replied that he was more than twenty feet away and only shouted. They fell down while fleeing. Asked Constable Sun Hanchen No. 98, a Chinese constable, if he went with the Russian constable on the evening of the 6th, he replied that they were in front and he was behind. Asked how Liu Mingshan fell into the river, he replied that he was behind and the Russian constable was in front, more than twenty steps apart. He heard a splash and only then knew that someone had fallen into the river. The judge ordered Gu Hongsheng and Yang Akun to be brought to the court. Gu Hongsheng testified that he was 23 years old, from Wuxi, worked as a lacquerer, and lived at No. 4, Alley 223, opposite Little World, and worked with the deceased.

<p>that he did business with the deceased. Asked how Liu Mingshan fell into the water, he replied that he, Liu, and Yang were together at the Taikoo Wharf to cool off. Liu was sitting on the floor under an iron stool, Yang was sitting on the iron stool, and he was standing beside them. There were also more than ten people nearby. A Russian constable came and kicked Liu once, and Liu stood up to avoid him, but was kicked again, causing him to fall into the river. He tried to pull him up, but it was too late, so he turned to pull the Russian constable, but was pushed away and also fell into the river. He was rescued by someone. Asked why he kicked him, he replied that he did not know. Asked if it was due to gambling disputes, he replied that there was no gambling dispute. The judge gave the photo to Gu to look at and instructed him to point out the positions of sitting and standing.</p>

<p>seven, from Ningbo, working as a patrolman at the Taikoo Wharf. Asked what happened that night, he replied that he was standing next to the electric pole, and the deceased and others were sitting on an iron bench. Suddenly, he saw a Russian constable come and kick the deceased twice into the river. He saw a person wearing a white short shirt and black trousers with a long body pulling the deceased, but he was also pushed into the river by the Russian constable. At first, the deceased was sitting facing inward and with his back facing outward, but after being kicked once, he stood up and stepped back three to five feet, and then was kicked again, and then fell into the river. Asked if it was Russian Constable No. 91, Lu examined the constable's face and replied that it was. Summoned Yang Akun, asked if he knew Liu, he replied that they did business together. Asked how Liu fell into the water, he replied that where Liu was sitting,</p>
<h3 id="e158">About Three to Five Feet from the River <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>After being kicked, Liu stood</p>
<p>up and stepped back,</p>
<p>and was kicked again,</p>
<p>and then fell down. Asked if he went to pull him, he replied that he walked away when he saw Liu being kicked. Summoned Russian Constable No. 106 to the court, asked if he went to patrol the Huangpu Bund at nine o'clock on the 6th, he replied that he did. Asked what happened, he replied that his rank was higher than No. 91, and he saw someone gambling and arguing, so he ordered No. 91 to expel them. Asked how many people were on the wharf, he replied about twenty. Asked how Liu Mingshan fell into the river, he replied that he did not see.

<p>Transported from the Wanguo Apartment on Avenue Joffre</p>
<p>The transporting car was hired by a Russian</p>
<p>The body examined in Kobe seems to be a Chinese woman</p>
<p>Some say it may be related to a missing Russian woman</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maru of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, which departed from Shanghai for Japan at 3 p.m. on August 5th, discovered a strange odor when unloading luggage in its baggage hold when the ship arrived in Kobe on the 7th. Upon opening it for inspection, it was found to be the corpse of a murdered woman, about twenty-seven or eight years old. However, the body was so decomposed that her nationality could not be identified. The Kobe Marine Police immediately telegraphed the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai to investigate the person who packed the suitcase. The police department of the Consulate and the police departments of the British and French concessions have all mobilized to investigate. It is reported that the investigation of this case has yielded clues, and the situation will be recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Mobilized Together <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>When the Japanese Consulate-General in this city</p>
<p>received this information, it noted that</p>
<p>a Japanese woman from No. 608 Yuyuan Road</p>
<p>had recently gone missing, so they paid special attention to this. In addition to ordering the police department attached to the consulate to start an investigation, they also notified the public concession and the French concession police authorities separately. Two weeks ago, the French concession authorities reported that a Polish Russian woman, 14 years of age, had gone missing, so they believed that this case might be related. Therefore, they also unanimously mobilized and conducted a close investigation separately.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Investigating the Origin <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha thought</p>
<p>the suitcase was handled</p>
<p>and reported by the Hongkou Japanese Shanghai Travel Agency.</p>
<p>Now that this bizarre case has occurred, it has also begun to investigate the origin. The company reported that a Western-dressed man contacted the company at the time, but the man's address was not known in detail. So they went to Huishan Wharf, summoned all the workers, and asked who had taken care of this luggage and which company had hired the car. Fortunately, one of the workers remembered that the luggage was transported by the Shanghai Public Transportation Company in this city. Therefore, the company believed that it had obtained some clues and reported everything to all relevant parties.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Police Interrogation <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the report, the public concession police</p>
<p>immediately investigated and found that the Public</p>
<p>Transportation Company was located</p>
<p>opposite Avenue Edward VII on North Henan Road. They immediately summoned Chen Gencai, the owner of the company. According to Chen Gencai's report, the car was driven by carter Zhu Aying. So they summoned Zhu Aying, who reported that he was hired by a Russian nicknamed "Little Luo Song" on the noon of August 5th. The Russian was an employee of a certain American transportation department on Renmei Road and was familiar with him. The police then summoned the Russian, who also reported all the details of what happened. However, the above-mentioned people were absolutely irrelevant to the content of this case.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Carter's Report <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>According to carter Zhu Aying,</p>
<p>he was looking for business around</p>
<p>the New Customs Wharf. The Russian, Little</p>
<p>Luo Song, was familiar with him and would always</p>
<p>hire his car to transport goods. At 11:30 a.m. on August 5th, he had just found a job and was planning to go to Yuyuan Road when he met Little Luo Song, who was anxious to transport several pieces of luggage. So, after</p>
<p>first going to Yuyuan Road, he drove to the destination designated by Little Luo Song. When he arrived, there were already many workers who had moved the luggage to the lower ground floor.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Transportation Circumstances <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>There were a total of seven pieces of luggage.</p>
<p>Originally on the second floor, when the car</p>
<p>arrived, they were all moved down.</p>
<p>There were six leather trunks and one iron box. However, the weight of the seven pieces of luggage was extremely heavy. When they were being loaded onto the car, the most noticeable thing was that the contents of the iron box seemed to be moving, and there was a feeling of shaking in the middle. The workers were unable to handle the weight, so they asked another strong worker to help carry it up. After loading everything, they drove to Huishan Wharf. Along the way, Little Luo Song and another unnamed Russian escorted the luggage. When they arrived at the wharf, it was only thirty or forty minutes before the ship was scheduled to depart, so it was immediately hoisted onto the ship and loaded into the baggage hold without being inspected by customs officers. Little Luo Song and others left after the luggage was on the ship. That was all the workers knew.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Corps Found <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>According to a follow-up telegram</p>
<p>from Japan yesterday, the murdered</p>
<p>woman's body has been</p>
<p>examined by a doctor and is confirmed</p>
<p>to be a Chinese woman, about twenty-seven or eight years old, short and very fat, with bound feet and pierced earlobes, and had never given birth. The cause of death was strangulation. There was a wound under her nose, indicating that she had struggled during the murder. According to the autopsy results of Dr. Torelian Mizu of the Hyogo Prefectural Criminal Division, the woman's body appeared to have been beaten to death with a blunt object and it was determined that she was a Chinese woman.</p>
<h3 id="e166">General Guess <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Currently, all police agencies</p>
<p>and the Japanese Consulate in this city</p>
<p>have gained some clues</p>
<p>about the case, but are still actively investigating. It is said that the luggage was shipped to Nagasaki on the day it was transported, and a Russian went with it. However, the Japanese investigation revealed that the Russian was not involved. As for the woman's clothes, it is said that they were made of Chinese materials, and her ears were pierced, as if she had worn earrings, and her feet had been bound, so it was concluded that she was a Chinese woman. However, since the escort was Russian, it seemed that she was not a Chinese woman. Therefore, the truth is still unknown.</p>

<p>Reuter's Kobe dispatch on the 8th:</p>
<p>The tragic death of the Chinese beauty in the suitcase</p>
<p>on the Shanghai Maru is being investigated jointly</p>
<p>by the Hyogo Prefectural Criminal Division and the Marine Police. Judging from the writing on the suitcase, the perpetrator is certainly a well-educated person. Moreover, the well-shaped mark written under the suitcase is an international mark for the recipient. The perpetrator also seems to be proficient in this area. Furthermore, judging from the traces of Majano and tea leaves in the stomach of the corpse, the victim seems to be an upper-class Chinese woman and has no experience of childbirth or any traces of licentious living. It is planned to extradite the body to the Chinese Consulate in Kobe. During the negotiation, regarding the search for the incident, as a result of the investigation since the discovery of the body, the Criminal Division telegraphed the Shanghai Consulate General Police this morning at 11 o'clock from the Shanghai Maru, which set sail from Kobe.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Worker Acts as Inside Man in Shin Xin No. 6 Factory Robbery Case <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Stolen factory entry permit to sneak in</p>
<p>Cai and Fan, the two thieves, each sentenced to seven years</p>
<p>On the afternoon of June 15th, at around 8 p.m., the Shin Xin No. 6 Cotton Mill at No. 22 Xihu Road was robbed of wages totaling 2,263 yuan. Subsequently, Fei Kelun, a Chinese detective from the Jiaxing Road police station, arrested the perpetrators Cai Defu, Fan Xiaobing (also known as Li Xiaobing, a coppersmith at the factory), and Gao Deqin. The Shandong woman, Ma Zhangshi (resident of No. 10 Yanshan Road), was also suspected and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Fan Xiaobing instigated the case, inviting Cai Defu and Ma Er (the son of Ma Zhangshi), who was at large, to conspire with Gao Deqin and others at Ma Zhangshi's house more than five times. Cai and Ma were smuggled in by Fan Xiaobing using a stolen factory entry permit to carry out the robbery. Although Gao Deqin did not go, he received two yuan of the loot, which he admitted to at the police station, etc. Cai Defu confessed that Fan Xiaobing and Ma Er were responsible for the robbery, and that Ma Er carried the pistol, etc. Fan Xiaobing confessed that a worker surnamed Liao came up with the idea and forced him to join by threatening him with a pistol. At the time of the incident, he had already finished work and was on the lookout near the Huade Road Bridge. After the incident, Ma Er and a person surnamed Ding took the loot, and he did not receive any of it, etc. His confession was evasive. Gao Deqin confessed that he knew Cai Defu, and although he knew the result of the third conspiracy to rob, he did not go. Afterward, Cai Defu gave him two yuan, etc. Ma Zhangshi confessed that Zhang Er was her second son, and he used to wander outside and did not support his elderly mother. Now, he relies on his eldest son, Ma Dadu, to make a living. She knew nothing about the robbery of the yarn factory and begged for leniency. Judge Xiao asked both lawyers to debate the case and then sentenced Cai Defu and Fan Xiaobing to seven years of imprisonment each. Gao Deqin was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The number of days detained before the judgment was confirmed would be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention. Ma Zhangshi was found not guilty. The police lawyer Zhang abandoned the appeal, and she was released in court.</p>

The gamblers were allowed to post a bail of 100 yuan each, and the rest were detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The defendant Zhu Aqiu hired three lawyers, Fan Gang, Wang Peiyuan, and Liu Gui. Yu Qingsheng, who was released on bail, hired lawyer Yu Hualong to appear in court on his behalf. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stood up and stated the case, saying that the police had confiscated many gambling tools and gambling ledgers as evidence. In addition to prosecuting the first defendant, Zhu Aqiu, for the crime of running a gambling den, he was also charged with illegal possession of smoking paraphernalia under Article 3 of the Prohibition of Opium Act and should be punished according to the law.

<p>At 2:45 p.m. yesterday, the Longmaozhan ferry from Pudong Lujiazui was carrying passengers back to Pudong from the Guangdong Road wharf on the other side when, just as it reached the center of the river, a young man among the passengers suddenly leaped into the raging waves, intending to commit suicide. The captain of the ferry, Tang Yingu, noticed this immediately and stopped the ferry and managed to rescue him. He was sent to the Marine Police Station, where he identified himself as Guo Shifang, 23 years old, from Fuzhou. He refused to reveal the reason for his suicide. A diary was found on his person, containing a few lines expressing a pessimistic mood.</p>
<p>They were extremely sad and are recorded below:</p>
<p>"When a man is about to die, his words are good; when a bird is about to die, its cries are mournful. Unfortunately, I have left home since I was young and wandered outdoors, spending more than seven or eight years in vain. Ashamed of not making a name for myself, I have developed a pessimistic view of the world and want to commit suicide."</p>
<p>After reading it, the police chief asked him if he had any relatives or friends in Shanghai. He said that he had a cousin living at No. 11 Rongyang Lane on Avenue Haig, but he resolutely refused to go. The police chief then sent detective Wang Haiquan to take him to the Fujian Fellow Association for relief.</p>

<p>At 1 p.m. the day before yesterday, melon vendors Zhu Suqin and Xia Shuming from Jiangbei were hawking watermelons inside the Yuanhe Silk Factory at No. 216 Route des Soeurs. The craftsmen upstairs in the silk factory, Li Pinyan, scolded Zhu and others for not shouting so loudly. Zhu and others refused to remain silent, so they quarreled with each other. Li was angered by Zhu and others' words and went downstairs to start a fight. Li was no match for Zhu and Xia and was injured on the spot. Tang Sibao, Gu Songting, Zhang Peiyuan, and Duan Jinyang, coppersmiths who worked upstairs with Li, were indignant and rushed downstairs to help. Seeing the crowd, Zhu took a sharp melon-cutting knife and stabbed Tang Sibao's wrist twice. Because Zhu dared to add a sharp knife and was extremely fierce, the crowd dragged Zhu into the factory, closed the door, and beat him severely. Xia Jinhong, the owner of the pancake stall across from the silk factory, first went to mediate, and then joined the battle. When Zhu was surrounded, someone frantically blew the police whistle. Two Chinese policemen from No. 1269 and No. 2399 nearby heard the sound and rushed to knock open the factory door. They saw that Zhu had been beaten and injured and had fallen to the ground, barely breathing. They immediately arrested all the perpetrators and took them to the Huisi Police Station for detention. Detective Shen Dehui was dispatched to send the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Li Pinyan and the other seven people, as well as the murder weapon found on the spot, were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where they were interrogated by Judge Liu Yugui. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, saying that Zhu was now in the hospital and requested a postponement. Judge Liu questioned Li and others and ordered them to be detained pending a deferred trial.</p>

The suicide note is recorded below: "Comrades, now I am permanently separated from you. My weak talents are truly shameful.

Su usually works as a gatekeeper (commonly known as "kan nongtang"). He has some savings. When he was 54, his wife picked up an abandoned baby (female) at the entrance of the lane. They took her home, hired a wet nurse, and raised her. They named her Aifeng, also known as San Nv. They doted on her, cherishing her like a treasure. Aifeng is now 17 years old, quite beautiful. When dressing up, she often goes out to play. Because Su loves her so much, he is relatively lenient in discipline, hoping to find a son-in-law in the future to enjoy his old age. Unexpectedly, Aifeng was incited by scoundrels. A few days ago, she took away clothes and ornaments worth hundreds of yuan, as well as cash, and ran away without a trace. The old couple searched everywhere but could not find her. They were extremely frustrated, deeply afraid that their daughter had fallen into the hands of bandits and would suffer in the future.

<h3 id="e192">Draft of the Municipal Social Bureau's Rural Revival Plan <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Focus on Stabilizing Farmers' Lives</p>
<p>Regulating Finance and Improving Operations</p>
<p>Is a Pressing Need of the Moment</p>
<p>The Social Bureau issued a draft of the Shanghai Municipal Rural Revival Plan yesterday, saying that in recent years, the agricultural situation in our country has gradually declined, the amount of agricultural crops has been decreasing day by day, the countryside has collapsed, and the economy has gone bankrupt. In order to seek relief, the government has held food conferences, agricultural finance conferences, and silk relief conferences. Recently, the Executive Yuan has organized the Rural Revival Committee to discuss everything in order to plan the revival of the countryside. It has recently issued a general order to all provinces and cities to set up branches of the Rural Revival Committee to assist the central government in all its work. This is an important policy and cannot be delayed. Although Shanghai is a gathering area for industry and commerce, it has more than 500,000 mu of farmland, with villages and dense population. Before the January 28 Shanghai War, farmers, due to the upward trend of living standards and the pressure of the urban economy, found it difficult to maintain the livelihood of a family with the output of farmland. They often came to Shanghai to work in factories during slack farming seasons and still went home to cultivate during busy farming seasons. The rural economy can be greatly adjusted. Since the January 28 War, not only the villages in Zhabei have been repeatedly looted and burned, and their family property has been destroyed. The rural areas in other districts have also suffered extremely heavy economic blows. Moreover, after the war, various factories, due to economic pressure, either announced the suspension of business or implemented wage cuts. Farmers in this city who usually use the slack farming season to work in factories have no place to set foot. The economic income of farming families has been greatly reduced. The crisis of rural bankruptcy is imminent. When the Executive Yuan orders this city to organize a branch of the Rural Revival Committee, I will put forward the plan to revive the rural areas of this city based on what I have seen, hoping to adopt it. Reviving the countryside is useless to the actual situation to talk empty words. It is necessary to raise considerable funds and proceed in stages to be effective. Now that the rural areas of this city are on the verge of bankruptcy, if we want to revive it, we cannot achieve it overnight. We must first conduct a detailed investigation, find out the causes of rural decline, and then find ways to help, prescribe medicine according to the symptoms, so that farmers can return to normal, have enough food and clothing, live and work in peace, so that they can engage in rural revitalization and various constructions. Therefore, to revive the countryside, we must first provide considerable relief, otherwise, if we do not improve its foundation and work on its end, we have not seen that it can be effective. If farmers have no time to save themselves from death, how can they encourage their remaining courage to seek revival and construction? Therefore, before discussing rural revival, we should first discuss rural relief, which is described as follows:</p>
<p>First Relief Methods</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, to revive the countryside, the first thing is to relieve the farmers, so that they can live and work in peace, and do not change their minds, leave the countryside, and flee to the cities, which is the most important plan. Those who engage in agriculture are farmers. If we do not first maintain their lives and stabilize them, and desire them to improve agriculture and develop the economy with a body that is hard-working all day long but cannot be full, it is like climbing a tree to catch fish. The relief measures are described as follows: (to be continued)</p>

<p>The Chinese Educational Film Association believes that many foreign films coming to China do not conform to our national conditions. If we only take passive inspection and banning, it is not a thorough solution. Therefore, the five educational film material selection standards set by the association, and examples to prove what kind of films are welcomed by our country, have been translated into English. The association has sent them to European and American film companies as a reference for future film production, in order to correct foreigners' psychology and seek sincere cooperation with each other.

<p>(Central News Agency) In the past, the municipal elementary school teachers in this city were appointed by the principals and reported to the Bureau of Education for record. This semester, the Bureau of Education followed the regulations for elementary schools promulgated by the Ministry and revised the rules for the appointment and dismissal of municipal elementary school teachers.  It ordered all schools to appoint teachers in accordance with the selection of qualified personnel to be reported to the Bureau for approval before hiring them, in order to emphasize the importance of teachers. Recently, elementary schools have submitted the list of teachers they intend to hire, filling out the appointment forms and submitting the registration certificates to the Bureau for review. Occasionally, one or two principals, in order to show favor to others, also list unqualified personnel in the forms to try their luck. It is said that the Bureau of Education will severely reprimand them to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>Statement from the Women's Bookstore</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Huang Xinmian of the Women's Bookstore, which stated: "To the respected Mr. Reporter, yesterday, your newspaper published an article entitled 'Author of 'The Wedding Night' Impersonates Wu Ben' (Editor's note: This article was sent by the Shanghai News Agency for publication). The content involves our bookstore. After reading it, our colleagues were filled with indignation. They immediately went to Haoyundao Bookstore on Jiaotong Road and purchased a copy of the book. On the copyright page, it indeed stated 'Published by Shanghai Women's Bookstore.' Upon investigation, our bookstore has always aimed to assist women's education and develop women's knowledge and never publishes vulgar books. This book was clearly published by Haoyundao Bookstore, and the owner of the book is the owner of the bookstore. They dare to disregard the law and steal the name of our bookstore, which is extremely hateful. The Municipal Bureau of Education did not investigate with our bookstore first but announced it in the newspaper, which is also too rash. In addition to filing a lawsuit according to the law, our bookstore has always admired your newspaper's reliable record of history. Therefore, we dare to present the facts and responsibly send this letter requesting a correction to avoid confusing the public. Please accept our greetings, August 8th."</p>

<p>Purchase of more than ten acres of land to build a swimming pool and campus</p>
<p>Since its establishment, Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers' College in Jiangwan has taken a pragmatic approach as its purpose. Over the past nine years, its equipment has been complete, its courses have been serious, and its talents have emerged. The graduates of each class have served at home and abroad, and many of them have been trusted by people from all walks of life. It is said that more than 30 graduates from this session have received letters and telegrams from public and private middle schools in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, and the two Cantonese provinces, inviting them to work, and the number of new students applying for this semester has been very enthusiastic. The school had previously built a new school building on Xiangyin Road in Jiangwan in 1931 of the Republic of China because the number of students coming to study was increasing. The physical education facilities, such as the gymnasium, the track and field, and various outdoor ball fields, were fully equipped. It is said that Principal Yu believes that the promotion of women's swimming in our country is essential, so he had the motive of building a swimming pool early on, but it was interrupted by the Shanghai Incident. Now, he is still proceeding with the realization of the swimming pool with his original intention of running the school. With the support of parents last month, he purchased more than ten acres of land near the school yesterday to build a large-scale swimming pool and a quiet campus. He is now planning everything and will start construction soon.</p>

<h3 id="e206">New Plans for New Huan School <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Since New Huan Elementary School moved to the new school building at the intersection of Parker Road and Kuling Road and added a junior commercial vocational school, on the one hand, it has been supported by the school board members Chu Minyi, Wu Xingya, Du Yuesheng, Wang Boqun, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zainen, Jiang Wenyu, Zheng Tonghe, Wang Xiaoying, Pan Yangyao, Shen Yizhen, Lu Shaoji, He Yangxian, Wu Ruinian, and Zhou Zanming. On the other hand, with the planning and management of school affairs by principals Zhang Zhonghuan and Zhang Xinbo, it is progressing rapidly. Faculty and staff have been hired. Vocational school teachers are all experts who graduated from famous universities. Elementary school teachers are mostly graduates of the normal schools of the provincial Shangzhong and municipal Wuben schools. The equipment is all new and pays attention to hygiene. In addition to Principal Zhang donating thousands of private collections of books to the school, a large number of books, instruments, typewriters, pianos, etc. have been continuously added. For the sake of student practice, a consumer cooperative has been set up first, and practice banks will be added in the future. At the same time, in order to reduce the burden on parents, the school tuition is extremely low and scholarships and free students are provided. It is said that in order to meet social needs, the school has an affiliated night school and women's remedial school, and there has been a very enthusiastic response recently. The school is currently trying to rent several school buildings nearby to develop.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) The National Games Organizing Committee resolved eight major cases at the ninth standing committee meeting on the evening of the 7th.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Eight Important Resolutions of the Standing Committee <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>

<h3 id="e210">Selection of Far Eastern Representatives Simultaneously <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the selection of athletes to represent our country at the 10th Far Eastern Games, it was decided to select them at this National Games. Because the period between the two games is only half a year, active practice during the transition period can gradually improve technology. The training methods before participation and the standards for determining athletes must be discussed and decided by the Organizing Committee in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Conference Will Be Held Continuously for Ten Days <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The duration of this National Games is scheduled to be held continuously for ten days from October 10th. However, in the event of insufficient time for ball games or special circumstances, it may be extended temporarily by the Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Swimming Pool Planned to Be Borrowed from Military School <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the construction of the venue, it has already begun around the venue. It is planned to divide the area and build sheds to set up temporary shops. Regarding the swimming problems of the conference, the original swimming pool of the Central Stadium, on the one hand, has not been filled with water after it was built, nor has it been covered. Cracks have appeared at the bottom, and there is a risk of leakage. If it cannot be applied at that time, it is planned to borrow the swimming pool of the Central Military Academy to be prudent.</p>
<p>(Nanjing Communication) The 22nd National Games have been scheduled to be held in Nanjing on October 10th. The venue of the conference was assigned on the first of this month to receive members from the Mausoleum Management Committee. It is now engaged in the layout of the venue. There have been claims that the Far Eastern Games are scheduled to be held, and it would be best to reschedule this year's Games to the spring of next year as a preliminary selection for the Far Eastern Games. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency stationed in Beijing recently visited the authorities in charge of the National Games to inquire about the opinions on the rescheduling issue and the preparations for the athletes' congress and ticket sales to participate in the Far Eastern Games. The reply is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e213">No Rescheduling <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>According to the discussion, it is said that the conference must be rescheduled to be held in the spring of next year. This claim is purely a personal opinion, because the decision of this National Games to be held on October 10th is due to: (1) This National Games is a continuation of the 20th National Games and is held on National Day according to previous resolutions. (2) Autumn is better than spring for weather. Summer and winter are not suitable for sports, and there is a lot of rain in spring. It is not possible to stop the Games halfway, and sports are also quite inconvenient. Due to the weather, autumn is the most suitable for the National Games. (3) Since the preparation of this Association, its important work has been roughly arranged, and it can be opened as scheduled as soon as it is carried out separately. If it is suddenly stopped, not only is time uneconomical, but also the loss of funds is uncountable. For the above reasons, this National Games cannot be rescheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Far Eastern Athletes <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>As for the issue of selecting athletes to attend the next Far Eastern Games, according to regulations, a preliminary competition should be held in the country first. However, at this time when the country's economy is stretched, we are unwilling to engage in waste. In order to save money, it has been decided not to hold a separate preliminary competition. Therefore, the athletes who attend the Far Eastern Games will be determined at this National Games. However, at that time, there are still half a year before the Far Eastern Games. It is planned to set a time after the selection and practice on time. The method for deciding the athletes still needs to be discussed in detail by the Organizing Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Vehicle Distribution <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The issue of temporary vehicles for the National Games was decided by the 20th National Games Preparatory Committee to borrow 100 cars from various provinces and cities to facilitate the return of athletes and spectators. A temporary station was set up to specially pick up and send athletes and spectators. In order to save money, this year it was reduced to fifty vehicles. It is learned that the Organizing Committee said that the 50 cars still need a lot of gasoline every day. Therefore, it is planned to use the prepared vehicles to pick up and send athletes and conference staff only. Spectators are generally on their own to save vehicles and save public funds. Regarding the construction of temporary stations, it is estimated that more than 2,000 yuan will be needed. We have contacted large car dealers in Shanghai and are preparing to negotiate exchange conditions on the principle of no cost. Otherwise, a temporary tarpaulin station will be built.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Ticket Sales at the Venue <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The sale of tickets to the audience at the venue was originally set at 10 cents per ticket according to the decision of the 20th Organizing Committee. This year, in order to make up for the expenses, it will be changed to 20 cents. However, according to the opinions of the general organizing committee, it is believed that in order to promote sports, the ticket price cannot be raised, increasing the burden on the people and reducing the enthusiasm of the audience. According to the budget of the Association, the income from ticket sales is about 27,000 yuan, while the temporary expenses at the venue are at least more than 35,000 yuan. Therefore, the income and expenditure at the venue are still insufficient by more than 8,000 yuan. The temporary remedy is to post advertisements on the day of the National Games. At the same time, the area around the venue is divided into temporary shop areas, so that shops can be set up in the venue, and the audience can buy snacks at any time and collect rent to make up for the temporary expenses of the venue.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Conference Period of Ten Days <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The duration of the conference is scheduled to be ten days from October 10th to October 20th. If there is not enough time for ball games, the Conference Committee may decide to extend the date. Regarding the National Arts, the General Assembly originally had regulations for National Arts competitions. However, this year, the Central National Arts Museum plans to take advantage of this time and place to hold the National Arts National Examination. It is learned that the site of the National Arts martial arts competition is very small and cannot accommodate a large number of people. Therefore, if the National Arts National Examination is held at the same time as the National Games, a separate location must be found, otherwise it must be held after the closing of the conference. This has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Good Food and Accommodation <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee is paying close attention to the issue of the meals for the athletes during the conference. It is planned to build a large reed shed next to the venue and recruit chefs from Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Sichuan, Ping, and Shaanxi, and other places to choose and eat by category. The conference is not responsible for it, which can save money and is convenient. Under the stands of the conference venue, in addition to some offices, the rest are dormitories for athletes. Two rows of wooden beds are set up in a room, divided into left and right rows. The bed is made of three layers. A room can accommodate twenty-four people. Statistics show that the dormitory area of the entire venue is sufficient for 2,000 people. In the corridor around the room, you can only see rows of room doors, which are neat and impressive. As for the conference staff, it is planned to use the school building of the Orphans' School in Zhongshanmen as a place to stay.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Enthusiastic Participation in Swimming Preliminaries <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese team's preliminary selection for the Sino-US-Japan triangular swimming competition of the West Youth Association is scheduled to be held at 8 pm on the 11th at Lanyuan on Milesi Avenue. Since its announcement, the registration has been very enthusiastic, which shows that there are many talents at sea. More than a dozen people, such as Chen Xinghan, Xie Guifang, Lin Yan, Ma Yijian, Mei Lu, and Hu Qijie from Fudan University, and Li Rixin of the Chinese Swimming Association, have participated. Several women, such as Hu Qiying, Hu Qiqiong, Zhang Jiazhen, and Liu Zuxin. For the championship competition, there are four women's events, five men's events, and one fancy relay race. The champion of each event will be given a full wool swimsuit by Fumin Woolen Factory. The first, second, and third place winners of each men's event and the first and second place winners of each women's event will be given gold, silver, and bronze medals by Shanghai Standard Sports Company. The men's individual championship will be given a silver shield by Qinfen Bookstore. The women's individual first place will be given a silver shield by the China Women's Physical Education School.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Zheng Zhaojia and Wang Wenzheng to Finalize the Chinese Open Tennis Singles Today <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Held at the Chinese Tennis Court at 4 pm</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Won Ma Anquan in Straight Sets Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chinese Open Tennis Singles Competition has reached the finals week since the start of the game. Zheng Zhaojia and Wang Wenzheng are scheduled to play in the final at the Chinese Tennis Court at 4 pm today to determine who will win the championship. In yesterday's semi-final between Zheng Zhaojia and Ma Anquan, Zheng won Ma 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Today's final between Zheng and Wang is the first most exciting competition since Shanghai Chinese has a formal singles championship competition. (Note: Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua did not participate in the Chinese Singles Championship, so the competition interest has not been strong over the years. The Zheng Wang battle this year is the most exciting, enough to compare with Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai)</p>
<h3 id="e223">Yesterday's Semi-Final <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the semi-final between Zheng Zhaojia and Ma Anquan, Zheng won in straight sets quite easily. A brief account of the process is as follows:</p>
<p>▲First Set: After the start, Zheng used low, fast shots to attack fiercely, making it difficult for Ma Anquan to parry, losing three games in a row. Ma then rallied himself, winning back two games, then made it four to three. Zheng won with six to three.</p>
<p>▲Second Set: Both won one game at the start. Zheng then added three games in a row, making it four to one, and then each added one game, winning six to two. In this set, Zheng repeatedly went to the net, with alternating gains and losses.</p>
<p>▲Third Set: Zheng's shots became more and more powerful, making it difficult for Ma Anquan to parry. Zheng won four games in a row. In the next game, Zheng lost one game due to self-destruction. Afterwards, each added one game, and Zheng finally won again with six to two.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Today's Final <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>▲Past Records: In this competition, Zheng Zhaojia had a bye in the preliminary round. In the second round, he won against Mao Hongfa with six to two, six to two, and nine to seven. In the semi-final, he won against Li Nan with three to six, six to two, six to two, and six to three. In the semi-final, he won against Ma Anquan with six to three, six to two, and six to two. Wang Wenzheng also had a bye in the preliminary round. In the second round, his opponent Zheng Zirong retired due to an arm injury. In the semi-final, he won against Sun Linfang with three to six, six to one, six to three, and six to one. In the semi-final, he won against Yu Tianguang with six to three, six to four, and six to zero. Looking at the two's records, they appear to be quite even.</p>
<p>▲Qualifications of the Two: Wang Wenzheng's background is similar to that of the famous French tennis player Cochet. From a young age, he served as a ball boy on the tennis court. From picking up balls, he progressed to become a Marker. He has been living on the tennis court for about twenty years. Having seen and heard so much, and through his own practice, his experience is the most extensive and his qualifications are the oldest in the country. This year, he regained his amateur status and is participating in a formal championship competition for the first time. He has great hopes. His skill is comparable to that of Qiu Feihai, but his connections are not as good as Qiu. As for Zheng Zhaojia, he is an outstanding talent in the youth circle of our country. Although his experience and qualifications are not as good as Wang Wenzheng, his skills have surpassed his predecessors. He has attended important championship competitions many times and is comparable to Lin Qiu.</p>
<p>▲Final Situation: Wang is known for his skillful play and few self-inflicted errors, while Zheng is known for his power and connections. Today's final will be as grand as the Qiu-Lin battle in the past. The audience's comments are divided, with some saying that Zheng Zhaojia can win and others saying that Wang Wenzheng can win. Because of this, the tennis community has great interest and hope in this final. It is enough to show the emerging atmosphere of the tennis community. In today's battle, it is hoped that the two will show their inherent strengths and give a very wonderful performance to reward the audience. Then victory is certainly gratifying, and defeat is also honorable.</p>

<p>America Meets China in the Semi-Final</p>
<p>In the preliminary round of the Rotary Cup International Tennis Tournament, the last two singles matches between the United States and Czechoslovakia were held at the China Tennis Court at 5 p.m. yesterday. As a result, the American players won again. In total, the United States eliminated Czechoslovakia with a score of five to zero. American Squia defeated Czech Tosha with six to four, six to four, and six to two. American Smith defeated Shanta with six to four, six to one, and six to two. The Americans' opponent in the semi-finals will be China, which will be held on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd of this month. The complete results of the United States and Czechoslovakia are as follows:</p>
<p>Squia (USA) {Six I One Six I Four Six I One} Shanta (Czech)</p>
<p>Smith (USA) {Six I Two Six I Three Six I Three} Tosha (Czech)</p>
<p>McDonald Laxey (USA) {Four I Six Seven I Five Six I Three Seven I Five} Kremerle Tosha (Czech)</p>
<p>Squia (USA) {Six I Four Six I Four Six I Two} Tosha (Czech)</p>
<p>Smith (USA) {Six I Four Six I One Six I Two} Shanta (Czech)</p>
<p>Yesterday's two singles matches, especially the match between Squia and Tosha, were more intense. Both sides performed well and won the praise of the spectators. Squia's victory seemed very assured, while Smith's victory over Shanta was easy. Only at the beginning of the first set, Shanta took the lead with two to zero.</p>
<p>Since the United States has eliminated Czechoslovakia, it has obtained the right to the semi-finals, meeting China in the semi-finals. The competition will be held at the China Tennis Court for three days, starting on the 20th of this month. On the other hand, Japan will play against Portugal, held on the same day as the United States and China.</p>

<h3 id="e228">A Farewell Gift to This Year's Students Studying Abroad <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Ti</p>
<p>The time for studying abroad comes around again. We hold endless hopes for the students studying abroad. As they are about to leave their motherland and go to foreign countries to seek the latest science and revive China, I cannot help but learn from the ancients and write a few parting words. Whether they listen or not is up to them, whether I write or not is up to me. In the Han Dynasty of our country, only foreigners came to China to study. It was not until the Tang Dynasty that people went abroad to study. Everyone knows that it was the Tang Monk Chen Xuanzang who went to the Western Paradise to obtain Buddhist scriptures. In an era of inconvenient transportation, he did not fear the dangers of mountains and rivers and went to India to study Buddhist scriptures. After returning to the country, he and his disciples translated 75 Buddhist scriptures. The highest philosophy of Buddhism was introduced to China by him, and the original philosophy of China was greatly influenced. This is the first success!</p>
<p>The second one is Xu Guangqi from Shanghai in the late Ming Dynasty. Although he never went abroad, he studied astronomy from foreigners, which is the same as the purpose of studying abroad. His teacher was the Italian Mr. Li Maibao, who was wearing the official uniform of the Ming Dynasty and hung in the Catholic Church. In addition to astronomy, he also studied firearms. He translated many books. Chinese people who studied Western academics probably started with Mr. Xu. I have seen a Shanghai gazetteer in English with a portrait of him, wearing the official uniform of the Ming Dynasty (not wearing a suit), standing upright in the center, with a globe and his works on the table next to him. This kind of spirit is beyond reach. This is the second success!</p>
<p>The third one is Yan Fu from Minhou in the late Qing Dynasty, a student studying in the United Kingdom. He translated many books, with Yuanfu, Tianyanlun, and Mueller's Mingxue being the most famous. Unfortunately, he was full of knowledge, but the Qing court could not reuse him. Being granted the title of Jinshi was the end of his study abroad career. It can be seen that his classmate, Ito Hirobumi of Japan, transformed Japan so that it was changing with each passing day. But although he did not get a position in politics! In the academic world, it is a different color. It can also be regarded as the third success!</p>
<p>The above three people, after completing their studies, the books they wrote were translations. They did not use the original text to teach people, but translated the original text into Chinese to teach people. From this, we can know the right and wrong of using the original text and the native language. Of course, I dare not say that the current students studying abroad do not have the knowledge of the three of them; nor dare I say that the current students studying abroad do not have the works of the three of them. But taking the number of students studying abroad in the past few decades as a ratio, the talents produced are too few to satisfy our hopes! It is also embarrassing to say that Japan has been reformed for 50 years, and for every important foreign book, they have a translation; for every new book published abroad, a Japanese translation can be seen within a few months. China has also been reformed for decades, but the textbooks used in universities are in the original text, and the scores are also in the original text. Isn't this treating China as a country without writing? I have also asked several professors, what is the reason? They said: "There are no good textbooks" or "It is more convenient" (convenient for oneself, not convenient for others), and even said "It is impossible to understand without using the original text." This can only be considered as an excuse. However, how to make textbooks with good translations, or original textbooks, and how to make the inconvenient convenient, who should take this responsibility? This is something that I would like to ask the students studying abroad to pay special attention to!</p>
<p>If not, we only need to invite a large number of foreigners to teach, and that's it: why bother to travel across the ocean to sell some raw materials and not be able to turn them into manufactured goods?</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The deathly silent hotel</p>
<p>is sleeping in the faint morning light. Last night's singing, shadows, red lights, and green wine: undoubtedly it is already silent, waiting for the coming of night.</p>
<p>In another room, maybe they are still having their good dreams, sweet dreams, hating the ruthlessness of the morning.</p>
<p>Most of the stupid, scheming fame and wealth seekers have already woken up in the middle of the night, but are waiting for the morning of today to implement their pre-planned plan.</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers waiting at the door do not care about "night" or "morning," only hoping that there will be more passengers than yesterday to maintain their lives.</p>
<p>A morning at the hotel is really a silhouette of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Bonus Year <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Quyu</p>
<p>A large bonus is just like the embroidered ball thrown by the princess to recruit a son-in-law in the old novels. It spins down in the air and lands on the lucky person. A thunderclap on the ground means getting a beautiful wife; becoming a son-in-law; wealth and glory, everything is complete. If a person wins a bonus, the amount is small, they can change seasons; go to the dance hall, and enjoy the present. If the amount is large, a foreign house, a car, and beautiful concubines can all be put to use at once.</p>
<p>"Read, read, read! There are golden houses in books. Read, read, read! There are Yan Ruyu and a thousand Zhong of millet in books." These words are really out of date in this 20th century modern era. If you read books, you are sure to starve to death and have no hope of getting rich. Only by buying lottery tickets can you have the blessing of your ancestors; the god of luck is following behind you. As soon as the lottery is drawn, it is the first prize, and hundreds of thousands of taels of white money are received. Marry a "Yan Ruyu"; build a "golden house"; happily spend money to move a "thousand Zhong of millet". Wouldn't it be everything you wished for in life? Buy, buy, buy! There are golden houses in the lottery ticket. Buy, buy, buy! There are Yan Ruyu in the lottery ticket. Buy, buy, buy! There are a thousand Zhong of millet in the lottery ticket. To put it more modestly, there are also bonuses for smoking cigarettes. You can choose any brand. The biggest first prize is 5,000 yuan; and the last one is also a cigarette. There are also prizes for drinking beer; there are also prizes for buying patterned cloth; in addition, mosquito incense, soap, buying books, visiting amusement parks: it is simply countless. Shanghai is full of bonuses. Whoever has a bright forehead; whoever has good luck, the spent banknotes: the white dollars, will fly into your pocket.</p>
<p>All kinds of businesses, except coffin shops, hospitals, and human meat markets, have not issued lottery tickets. In addition, there is a possibility of setting up bonuses. If you are not sure, the boss of the coffin shop will be jealous; the hospital and the human meat market will also issue lottery tickets in order to solicit business. The dead will definitely follow one after another; the hospital will hang a full sign; pieces of human flesh will be pressed into dried people, and the groups will come to receive this bonus. This year is the year of national goods. National goods have not been sold well, so it is better to set it as a bonus year. Lottery tickets are flying all over the sky; bonuses are rolling all over the ground. The people of the whole country strive to seize these many bonuses.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Abandoning the dark to seek the light, a beauty tacitly agrees</p>
<p>Inheriting the family tradition, strong men have a wild revelry</p>
<p>It was acceptable to accommodate Wang Shili's words and discuss it with a person or two. Even if he did not do it, there was no need to rush in a day or two. This thought of procrastination almost canceled out half of his idea of changing jobs that day. This day passed. The next day at twelve o'clock, the brothers were taking a nap. Zhao Ziqiang had nothing to do, so he walked out of the camp and went to the wilderness to walk around, so that he could think about his worries. Not far from Xiyuan is the Imperial Street leading to Longevity Mountain. Passing through the street, the sound of knives and spoons clattered in the restaurants, followed by bursts of oily aroma, drilling into his nose, causing people's appetite to unknowingly follow the aroma. He reached out and opened the cotton cloth curtain of a restaurant facing the street and walked in. A waiter greeted him with a smile and said, "Company Commander Zhao, what a rare visit! It's been a long time since you've taken care of us." Zhao Ziqiang said with a smile, "I haven't been paid for two months, what am I going to take care of you with? Can I eat things without paying?" The waiter said with a smile, "Company Commander Zhao is really a good person. You were paid today, so you came to take care of us today." Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said, "You really know how to talk. You would be willing to let me eat on credit even if I didn't have money, but you said that I came to eat today because I was paid. I want to ask you, how do you know that I was paid today?" The waiter said with a smile, "There is Company Commander Guan, you know him too, right? He said himself that he would come here for a few drinks whenever he was paid. He came here today, so I thought you must have been paid." Zhao Ziqiang sat down in a seat at the entrance, rubbing his hands together, and said with a smile, "You have seen through us. (Note: This means digging deeper.) We can't eat at small restaurants if we don't get paid?" The waiter did not answer this sentence. Someone in the private room behind him laughed and answered, "This is not wrong at all." As he spoke, the man lifted the curtain and came out. It was Guan Yaowu. Zhao Ziqiang said with a smile, "So you are here drinking. Did you get paid alone?" Guan Yaowu said, "I have been working hard all year round, and I have been living a simple life for a long time. Regardless of whether I am paid or not, I have to be comfortable. Come, come, come! Let's have a few drinks together." As he spoke, he pulled Zhao Ziqiang into the private room. (153)</p>

<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>The fire-umbrella-like sun also knows that it is forcing the people too hard, and cleverly hides behind the West Mountain for a while. The people who live in pigeon-cage-like houses, when they see the scorching sun go away, happily wave their fans; wear their slippers, and gather on the streets to enjoy the cool. They relieve their day's stagnation and enjoy the coolness and breeze of the night.</p>
<p>The cement sidewalks; the sides of the alleys are full of men and women sitting on rattan chairs and low stools. Most of the men are bare-chested; their trouser legs are rolled up to their calves. The women are wearing thin gauze shirts, showing their curves; their bare feet and jade legs are displayed very publicly. Who said that China is not promoting nude sports? The place to enjoy the cool is half naked.</p>
<p>The Ningbo woman from the East family is talking loudly about the chaotic dream of riding a white horse last night, and she bet a lot of money on him in the flower club, but a black dog came out. She sighed and said that Zhang Jiu the old monkey was making fun of her. The Suzhou woman is speaking softly about the mahjong sutra, and she has just won a four-fan card with flowers, winning several silver dollars. Young men and women are talking about the layout of the Grand Bright Cinema; the inability of the "White Sisters" film to have a grand reunion is very boring. Many children are squatting on the ground, gesticulating, and lecturing about how the Golden Arhat used a flying sword to cut off the head of the evil tyrant. There are also coolies in blue cloth shirts, recounting how Little Maozi in the nailing shed is so affectionate and righteous. This open-air meeting is really vivid and colorful; a hundred dramas are presented.</p>
<p>Gradually, the night is getting late, and the people who are enjoying the cool are feeling a little tired. A burst of erhu sounds comes from afar; followed by a sharp throat, an unnatural singing voice: "Sister is in that room: the first month is the New Year:"" singing while advertising. The nosy people stopped him and told him to sing. He can also hum a few donkeys and horses Peking opera tunes; he can also sing the new-style drizzle, sister I love you; he can also sing the old-style Four Seasons of Longing, Eighteen Touches. After singing for a while, everyone took out a few copper coins and put them together to give to the artist who dedicated his art to the public. The sound of the erhu and singing gradually faded away: people also felt tired, some lay down in the open air; some went back to the house to fight with bed bugs and resist the heat and stuffiness.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Two Envoys Named Zhang <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Among the newly appointed seven ambassadors abroad, only two are in the country, and the remaining five are all overseas. Recently, these two have both scheduled to sail to Belgium and Portugal to take up their new posts. The one stationed in Belgium is Zhang Naiyan, the former president of National Central University, and the one stationed in Portugal is Zhang Xinhai, an old professor at National Central University. Saying "old professor" means that his qualifications are old. As early as the Dongda era, he was a professor in the Department of Western Literature. Speaking of age, these two Zhang ambassadors are both under forty years old, so they cannot be considered old. Speaking of appearance, they are both handsome and calm, and full of energy. They are worthy of being the new Chinese ambassadors abroad. There is no old-fashioned style at all. In short, they do not lack any of the characteristics that an ambassador should have in terms of appearance.</p>
<p>Ambassador Zhang stationed in Portugal temporarily acted as a translator for Mei Lanfang when Bernard Shaw came to Shanghai this spring. His eloquence was so impressive that he attracted the attention of people in Shanghai. He has served as a counselor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years, and once served as the acting director of the European and American Department; however, because of his strong personality and difficulty in getting along with others, I wonder if his nature will be changed after traveling far away? He is rarely seen publishing articles in the country; but overseas, especially in various American magazines, his works can often be read. A writer who is well-known abroad is almost unknown in the country; this is very meaningful!</p>
<p>Ambassador Zhang stationed in Belgium originally studied chemistry (Indanthrene blue color cannot be washed away, which he invented); however, since returning to China, he has gained considerable reputation in the writing world by writing "The Complete History of the World War". Then the Commercial Press published the Yunlu Historical Series for him. The writing is beautiful and the material is carefully selected. It is not comparable to crudely made works. Some people say that his appearance is quite similar to Yan Huiqing, but I don't know if Ambassador Yan is also "a harmonious person" who sees people with "a smile on his face? It should be known that this Ambassador Zhang is not offensive to others, unlike that Ambassador Zhang who is difficult to get along with.</p>
<p>Ambassador Zhang stationed in Portugal declared that he would study the complete history of Sino-Portuguese diplomacy, because Portugal has a long history of trade with us, so the history is naturally longer and worth studying in detail. Ambassador Zhang stationed in Belgium, presumably has a background in historical research, so he declared that he would conduct a horizontal investigation of Belgium. Zhang Jingjiang is his uncle, and has already found a way for him to allocate one or two thousand from the Construction Committee for him to use as investigation expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Three Monk-Poets of the Republic of China <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Pu</p>
<p>Among monks who are famous for their poetry and have outstanding artistic talent, there are three since the Republic of China: (1) Manshu, (2) Jing'an, and (3) Hongyi.</p>
<p>Manshu's original surname was Su. He was a person with rich "natural wit", produced good poetry and prose, leaving behind grief and sympathy for later generations, which is truly indelible for thousands of years. Especially in recent years, after the praise of Mr. Liu Yazi and Mr. Shou Juan, he has attracted the attention of young people. All those who have been attacked by the waves of the times and are stained with helpless emotions love to read his poetry and prose. Because Manshu's poetry and prose can express the thoughts and feelings that people cannot easily express, and can say the beautiful feelings that people cannot say, but everyone can experience, that is, the so-called "scratching the itch." Therefore, his poignant and lingering, sad and clear verses are often people's best consolation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Jing'an is Master Jichan. He is proficient in internal scriptures and also good at chanting, and has published "The Collection of Eight-Fingered Ascetic." His inner practice is sincere, so his poems and lyrics are also very cold and elegant, without making frivolous words. It is rare to do so, and it is also an exception. I once saw one of his poems: "Layman Vimalakirti is too rampant, where does the heavenly girl come to scatter wonderful fragrance, I laugh at my Zen heart like a dead tree, it doesn't matter if flower branches accompany me." It is more interesting, and it is probably a temporary improvisation? Jing'an passed away in the early years of the Republic of China, when he rushed to the old capital to maintain the temple and petition the authorities. Unexpectedly, he was only in Beijing for less than ten days before he passed away.</p>
<p>As for Master Hongyi, his original surname was Li, and his name was Shutong. He once served as a newspaper editor and school teacher. He was proficient in painting, good at poetry and prose, and famous in the art world. He was also a rare genius in the world. However, in his later years, he abandoned learning and indulged in Zen, entered the empty door, practiced asceticism, and disciplined himself extremely strictly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw no fluctuations in either the British or American silver markets. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange saw a slight increase of five to eight hao. However, British-American exchange rates contracted by one fen, and American-British exchange rates decreased by three fen and seventy-five li. Although privately telegraphed silver prices rose by 0.0625, privately telegraphed exchange rates fell by four fen. American cotton fell by seventeen points, and American wheat and stocks both experienced slight declines. Market sentiment improved, and spot prices immediately rose. After the opening, there were initial advances and retreats, but later, due to aggressive buying of American dollars and an emergency in the foreign exchange market, coupled with the vigorous buying by Guangdong merchants, prices trended upward. At noon, prices leveled off slightly. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market remained tight, repeatedly breaking through the sixty-dollar mark. However, with many seizing the opportunity to sell at high prices, the market entered a state of fluctuation. Bombay initially fell two annas, but then remained stable. Market sentiment was generally stable, with many buyers and small fluctuations. Prices declined slightly at the close. Throughout the day, the situation was tense, with Guangdong merchants purchasing over 1,400 bars of gold. A speculator, Mr. Lu, also made purchases. Merchants from Dalian aggressively bought Dalian futures, hedging their positions in the spot market. The process was normal. Although Reuters reported in the morning that Song Ziwen, after meeting with Roosevelt, stated that the American President had decided to stop inflating the currency, this had little impact. The premium for smelted gold remained at $190. The spread for August/September swaps was about $3 to $4.50. Below is a record of the day's market conditions.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $849.50, an increase of $9 compared to last Saturday. Goods opened at $9. The foreign exchange market opened with recent selling prices of one shilling and three pence and one-quarter for British currency, and $28.25 for American currency. Yuan Maoyong immediately sold upon entering the market, causing a retreat to $7.50. The November American dollar was difficult to sell at $8.125. Mitsui aggressively bought October American dollars from $0.625 to $0.50.

Zhongfu and Guohua were unwilling to offer the November American dollar at $6.875. Bingxing, Dadecheng, and Zhaofengchang sold off, causing a decline. It was learned that HSBC's listing was flat for British currency, but only contracted by 0.125 for American currency. Yuanxing, Yongda Dalian merchants, and Cuitai all exited, causing a drop to $49.50. Sassoon sought to close out September shillings at 1.25, and October at 1.875. Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, and Zhengchang advanced to $53.50. Hengyu, Hengchang, Yongwanxing, and others sold again, causing another drop to $48.50. Fuyu, Hongli, and Fuchang aggressively bought, and the Japanese banks actively worked to close out positions. In addition, Hengxingyuan (representing Mr. Lu) also entered the market. Mitsui ate up the November American dollar at $4.375, pushing the price up to over $46. Guangdong merchant Hengxing vigorously bought, and the October American dollar at $3.75 was difficult to close out. It surged to $58.50. Citibank sold the September American dollar at $0.25 to Mitsui. Sumitomo sold off the November currency at $5.625, causing a decline. Although Hengxing and Yongfeng continued to buy strongly, Hengyu and Zhaofengchang simultaneously dumped their holdings. HSBC offered the October American dollar at $3.75, retreating to within $6. Macquarie managed to struggle on with the same price for the same month.</p>
<p>Later, HSBC and Citibank offered the October American dollar at $3.75 again. Wupin and Daxingyong all sold off, gradually retreating to $3.50.

Fuchang, Shunli, and Hengxing came to sell off, causing a drop to $57.80. Later, the foreign exchange market was still flat. Zhengchang and Hengyu advanced. Bombay telegraphed a decrease of two annas, causing a rise to $60.05. Zhifengyong and Dakang sold, leading to a large fluctuation. However, the fluctuations were not significant. Mitsui bought the September American dollar at $0.125, still managing to rise from around $58 to over $60. Finally, the Central Stock Company wanted to offer American currency, but the buying interest suddenly waned. Dadecheng, Yiyifeng, and Yongfuchang all sold, causing a fall to $56.70. The closing was $857.30. After the close, there was a slight decline, due to a slight sale by Bingxing and Hengyu. Goods sold at $7. Upon investigation, the highest price of the day was $860.50, and the lowest price was $847.50, a difference of $13. As a result, there was a return of $16.80 compared to last Saturday.</p>

<p>Aggressively Closing American Dollars: Selling Off Linked Exchanges</p>
<p>Dalian Merchants Advance: Hedging Futures Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in the near and far ends in London. The same was true for the American silver market. The forward silver price rose slightly. The British rate to the American rate fell by one fen, and the American rate to the British rate contracted by three fen and seventy-five li. Although the privately telegraphed silver price increased by 0.0625, the privately telegraphed exchange rate decreased by four fen. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of one shilling, three pence, and one-quarter for the British exchange rate, and $28.25 for the American exchange rate. Compared to last Saturday, the British currency was firm by 0.0625 and the American currency was tight by 0.1875. After the opening, the Bank of Japan aggressively bought, causing the HSBC listing to tighten. The British exchange rate was flat, and the American exchange rate contracted by 0.125. There was slight fluctuation, but with the Bank of Japan continuing its previous aggressive buying and Sassoon seeking to close out positions, the shillings consistently tightened. At noon, the market leveled off slightly. In the afternoon, Mitsui continued to buy aggressively, and Chengfengyong also came to buy and close out positions, making the situation even tighter. Bombay telegraphed a decrease of two annas. The transaction was not active. The British and American exchange rates were done between Hua Bi buying shillings and Macquarie buying American dollars, trading at four yuan, four jiao, and nine and a half fen for November. The closing price for recent sales was one shilling, two pence, and nine-three-seven-five for the British exchange rate, and $27.9375 for the American exchange rate. Compared to last Saturday, the British currency was tighter by 0.125, and the American currency was tighter by half a yuan. Within the banking sector, Mitsui's aggressive buying of American dollars was the most courageous. Other Japanese banks, such as the Korean, Taiwanese, and Sumitomo banks, also bought and hedged Dalian, covering Japanese-American exchange rates. Dalian merchants bought about 2 million in Dalian and exited futures contracts. The gold industry hedged over 100,000. A record of today's transactions is below.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market price for foreign and silver dollars was six fen in both the morning and afternoon, an improvement of one fen compared to the past few days, and the same as the previous day. Premium addition and adding water were at two to three fen. The ample supply of funds remained undiminished.

<p>Large Quantities Dumped in the Financial World</p>
<p>Short-Term Financials Drop $1.80 During Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to the stable situation and the perceived resolution of the crisis, the No. 46 firm in the financial world sold very aggressively, taking advantage of the firming market sentiment. Each item was sold, especially short-term financials. Northern firms, seeing the large influx of goods, did not temporarily cover short positions, as they did not know the full extent of No. 46's selling capacity. Market prices declined sharply due to the congestion of chips. This was a special phenomenon of temporarily disengaging from the environment and had no fundamental relationship to the increase or decrease. The reason is that once the selling stops, the rebound will be very fast. In the morning opening, bonds from the 18th and 19th years, although in a downward trend, only differed by two to three jiao. Starting with the 20th year, various firms, seeing the aggressive selling volume of the No. 46 firm, gave up on buying and watched to take advantage of the situation, and fell more significantly. Salt tax was relatively superior. Only short-term financials fell sharply by $1.80 during one trading session, due to the urgent selling by the No. 46 firm. In the next session, market sentiment softened. Northern firms not only did not cover but took the opportunity to release more, and market prices rebounded even less, ranging from five jiao to seven or eight jiao. When the auction reached salt tax, there were more buyers. This month was only a small decrease of 1.5 jiao, and next month was only a small decrease of 5 fen. Short-term financials, due to the No. 46 firm stopping selling, suddenly saw a rebound of seven or eight jiao. After that, they generally rebounded firmly. As a result, market prices uniformly rebounded by four or five jiao to $1.23. In the future, if the No. 46 firm does not sell off again, it will be very easy for market prices to rebound. The total number of transactions was 13,874,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan of spot goods. Futures were 4,760,000 for total salt tax, 1,550,000 for troop reduction, 1,460,000 for Ruguan concessions, 2,330,000 for twenty-year concessions, and 1,860,000 for short-term financials. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>

American cotton was unsettled because the government report was about to be announced. As a result, it fell by about seventeen points. The technical position had improved. Also, railway freight transport for the week of July 22nd to 28th totaled 638,396 vehicles, a decrease of 10,518 vehicles compared to the previous week, but an increase of 127,293 vehicles compared to the same period last year.

<p>The yarn market is calm and uneventful. In general, the two sides, long and short, will decide the winner after the American cotton estimate is released. However, the actual market demand is too sluggish, and the dumping of inferior yarn is quite severe. The majority of the trade in local yarn is snatched up by them. The general buyers, with their weak foundations, absorb to go long. In short, with the bad environment and financial difficulties, it is very difficult for the yarn market to improve.</p>

<p>The cotton market is gradually appearing soft, and American cotton is trending downwards. However, some received private telegrams stating that the government's estimates favored the longs. Therefore, there was no shortage of new buyers. The market atmosphere was firm. However, the domestic climate was favorable, and the new cotton crop was quite good. Cotton merchants from all over inevitably dumped at high prices. Afternoon trading was quite sparse. Both sides waited for the American cotton estimates before taking action.</p>

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market situation was mixed and uncertain, waiting for the next government report. It first fell due to the closing of long positions, and then firmed due to short covering. As a result, spot goods fell by fifteen points, and futures fell by fourteen to seventeen points. The Bombay cotton market was tired due to the poor performance of American cotton and the emptiness of the market, lacking buyers. As a result, Pingle fell by three rupees, Oomra fell by three and a half rupees, and Bai Luoxi fell by three rupees and two and a half rupees. The Liverpool and Egyptian cotton markets continued to be closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (7th telegram):</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, foreign wheat rebounded slightly by two jiao. Various mills dumped their holdings. Inland merchants also sold. Moreover, both the arrival and storage of wheat surged. Factory demand waited and watched. Standard wheat decreased by one jiao. The market sentiment was consistently soft. Furthermore, the actual consumption in northern ports was stagnant. A large batch of Russian flour had newly arrived in Tianjin. Its inventory at the end of the month was more than 3 million bags. Currently, the total amount is sufficient to sell for two to three months. Once the liquidation in this area is cut off, other places will lack major buyers. The local selling price in Northeast China was flat. Therefore, there were no continuing large-scale transactions. The market became more and more sluggish. Moreover, with merchants competing to sell, prices immediately decreased slightly. The closing prices for this month and January were each down 7.5 li, September was down 1.75 fen, October was down 1.5 fen, November was down 1 fen, and December was down 1.25 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market, each month appeared flat and soft. Subsequently, inland merchants and customers sold. Foreign wheat prices were reported down, and the market showed signs of weakness. In the afternoon, major firms dumped, and the downward trend was even more severe. Distant months were more affected by the selling trend than recent months, fearing that the United States would exploit them through price manipulation. Spot wheat factories maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Arrivals continued. Wheat inventory exceeded 300,000 bags. There was even more wheat inventory inland. Market sentiment was consistently bearish. There were no new transactions on the market. Only Xinda bought back 1,200 bags of high-quality Jiangbei wheat at a price of $3.72.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was over twenty firms. The market condition went from slack to tight. This was because the local merchants initially intended to be indifferent. Later, the buyers turned active and acquired 2,000-odd bags of thin rice. Therefore, they also advanced together. The sellers seized the opportunity to raise prices, and the market became tight. However, the plans for various thick japonica rices were set. Thin rice was slightly lively. The market improved by a corner. Du jian also looked refined. Although yang jian was in short supply, it was still trending flat, restrained by customer indica rice. Yinbian yuan showed fatigue and fell. As for the Dongxin japonica rice from the factories, due to the firm price in the producing area, it still maintained its old price. Therefore, it was difficult to break through the seven-yuan mark for a time. If the weather is cloudy and rainy, there is still a possibility of a turnaround.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's sources from the He Xia region were fifteen to sixteen firms. The sales of various goods on the market remained sluggish. The market shape was firm at the top grade of japonica rice, while the middle and lower grades were weak. Baiyuan also decreased by a corner. Thin rice was soft. There was not much fluctuation in early rice and yang Du埠客. Dongxin japonica rice was flat. Xin 客尖yesterday has been in the market, about one hundred forty to fifty Shi has arrived.

<p>Customer Indica and Customer Rice are Active Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer indica and customer rice were active again. Ningbo firms in Zhejiang province were even more greedy. Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and local firms all made inquiries. However, the existing inventory on the market was gradually scarce. New arrivals were very few. Stored goods had also been distributed to customers. The existing rice was also of medium to lower grade, not to the liking of buyers. Therefore, if high-quality new arrivals were available on Sunday, various firms would compete to acquire them. Yesterday, 50 bags of Hunan old cargo rough red rice newly arrived, and were preempted by the Ningbo firms. The price opened at six yuan, three jiao, and two fen, a sudden increase of two jiao compared to the previous day's opening price. The market prices of other rices also turned to a flat position due to the small inventory and the revival of customer demand. The Yong firms also took 177 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice at 7.65 yuan, 141 bags of Hunan machine oil rice at 7.31 yuan, and 287 bags of machine red rice at 7.28 yuan. The Min firms took 100 bags of machine Jing rice at 5.9 yuan, and local firms took 150 bags of Jiangxi machine yuan rice at 8.95 yuan.</p>

<p>The red grain market has long lacked good conditions, due to the decreasing sales. However, the existing grain in stock is gradually decreasing, and most of it is moldy. Moreover, inland areas have recently had sporadic sales of high-quality, dry goods. Therefore, at this time of scarcity, the high-quality goods have risen by three to four fen, it is said.</p>

<p>Dried vermicelli is produced in Longkou, Yantai, Jiangbei, and other places. Longkou vermicelli is considered the best quality. It is made from top-grade mung bean flour. The strands are extremely fine, with a clean white color and luster. They are also longer in length and have good tensile strength when dried, making them less likely to break, resulting in very few broken pieces. Yantai vermicelli is second best, made from lower-grade mung bean flour. The strands are coarser and shorter, lacking tensile strength, resulting in more broken pieces. They often clump together in bird's nest shapes. Jiangbei vermicelli is the lowest grade, with a yellow color and even coarser, shorter strands, being brittle and easily broken, and the output is also small. Therefore, Longkou vermicelli is the most popular due to its superior quality. It is a durable pantry staple used in cooking, especially for soups. It is suitable for both meat and vegetarian dishes, making it a convenient dried food item.</p>

<h3 id="e262">The Debate Between Sweet and Salty <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>A likes to eat sweet, B likes to eat salty.</p>
<p>Because A likes to eat sweet, A says how delicious sweet is, how beneficial it is to eat, and how elegant or magnificent it is to eat. Others who also like to eat sweet echo A's theories, doctrines, or ideologies, and thus become the A faction. B becomes the B faction for the same reasons.</p>
<p>Since there can only be one dominant doctrine, A wants to overthrow B, and B also wants to overthrow A: thus, the debate begins. This is a debate where both the sweet and salty factions believe that their own doctrine should be dominant.</p>
<p>There is also a type of debate where one of the factions does not believe that their own doctrine should be dominant, and even believes that the other faction's doctrine should be dominant, just as that faction believes itself.</p>
<p>Wouldn't that mean there shouldn't be a debate? But there is.</p>
<p>The A faction likes to eat sweet, but they feel that eating sweet is a mistake and that they should actually eat salty. Therefore, they propose a doctrine of eating both sweet and salty, or eating sweet without forgetting salty, even though they may not like to eat salty, or even be unable to eat salty. But they cannot help but propose it because they see clearly, or think they see clearly, that the salty faction's doctrine will be dominant.</p>
<p>But the salty faction finds this doctrine somewhat perplexing, because if they know they should eat salty, why don't they actually eat salty? Why do they still propose this doctrine of harmonizing sweet and salty? Therefore, the salty faction writes rebuttals, and the sweet faction writes replies. Thus, the debate begins again.</p>
<p>Seeing the failure of that sweet faction, or sweet-salty harmonization faction, those who are sensible and aware of the times, those who eat sweet, all say unanimously that eating sweet is undesirable, a habit of young masters, and that eating salty is what heroes and heroic figures do. Because they think they can secretly eat sweet, they must endorse salty in their writing.</p>
<p>Therefore, all the articles in the world are nothing but endorsements of salty, and the debate between sweet and salty comes to an end forever.</p>

<h3 id="e264">Advertisement <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Min</p>
<p>The advertisement says, "Mr. Chen Wangdao, former professor at Fudan University, comments: The Open-Minded National Language textbooks have exquisite and harmonious illustrations, calligraphy, and writing. The words and lines contain rich suggestive power. The examination of calligraphy lessons and the arrangement of phonetic symbols show painstaking effort."</p>
<p>The Open-Minded National Language textbooks are compiled by Mr. Ye Shaojun.</p>
<p>Indeed, they have some distinctive features, but they also have "shortcomings." When Mr. Chen Wangdao mentions phonetic symbols, we can actually find errors in the pronunciation of the national language in these textbooks. In Book 8, Lesson 3, it is written "馬托車." From the context, it is definitely a car, Motor car, but the word "馬" is pronounced in "National Language" as IY in the rising tone,</p>
<p>not LH. If we follow the Romanization spelling of the "Commonly Used Characters of the National Pronunciation Vocabulary" promulgated by the Ministry of Education last year, then "馬托車" would become Maetuoche, which no one, East or West, North or South, would understand what it is. If we say that the word "馬" should be pronounced according to the Southern accent, then the entire textbook's Beijing pronunciation is annotated with the "standard National Language" pronunciation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is very regrettable that there are even grammatical errors in this textbook. In Book 4, Lesson 26: "牆上開朶小紅花，牆下蝸牛去看花：無數花開朶朶紅，一齊笑臉歡迎他。(A small red flower blooms on the wall, snails go to see the flower under the wall: countless flowers bloom red, all smiling to welcome him.)" According to the habits of vernacular grammar, it seems that "開朶" means "開着一朶 (blooming a flower)", so why does the following sentence change to "無數花 (countless flowers)"? These are still occasional "oversights" that are easy to correct.</p>
<p>Speaking of "suggestive power," there is a lesson in Book 8 called "The Poor Man and the Rich Man" (Lesson 5). This is the story:</p>
<p>The poor man asks the rich man for the method of "getting rich." The rich man says, "Everything I have here is stolen." So the poor man goes on a stealing spree, and as a result, he is naturally caught. Three years later, he comes out of prison and scolds the rich man as a "bad guy, I fell for your trick." The rich man's answer is wonderful: "I steal natural things, not other people's things: I plant fields, plow land, quarry stone, fell trees: aren't all these natural things? I stole them, and no one has anything to say. As for the things that people have worked so hard to get, they should only be enjoyed by those people. How can you steal them?"</p>
<p>I think it is necessary to add a lesson after this, saying that after hearing this, the poor man really goes to "plant fields, plow land, quarry stone, fell trees:" but landlords and other people jump out of nowhere and ask him to pay rent and settle accounts. He falls for the trick again. When he goes to ask the rich man again, the rich man will tell him: "I am cultivating my own fields, who told you that you don't have your own land, etc.!" The rich man knows in his heart: the method of getting rich lies in getting others to work for himself. But this is a secret. It can't be revealed. Yes, this lesson must be "supplemented," otherwise the poor man will fall for Mr. Ye's trick.</p>
<p>Free Talk has mentioned the need for concrete criticism of elementary school textbooks. I am just writing a few sentences at random, which cannot be regarded as criticism. Perhaps it is just a little feeling after reading the advertisement; and I still admit that Mr. Ye's textbook is comparatively good already.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Homesickness <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Zhang</p>
<p>When people are in adversity, they subconsciously think of the people they love and the things they cherish. Travelers in the desert yearn for water and grass, sailors yearn for land, and similarly, in the desolation and boredom of a lodging, one thinks of their hometown and feels homesick. I left my hometown when I was twelve years old, and it has been almost ten years since. During this time, I have experienced much hardship, and my childlike heart has not yet changed. Sometimes I still say a few silly things that "righteous gentlemen" cannot understand.</p>
<p>In recent years, the society I have come into contact with has gradually grown larger; the impression of treachery and violence stabs my chest! I do not have the heart to shrink back and retreat. I have prepared my flesh and blood to bear the hardships of the times! But whenever I wake up in the middle of the night and think of everything in my hometown, I am confused! This is homesickness.</p>
<p>Old Man Qiming said that his affection for his hometown is due to the fact that he "fishes here and roams here." Although there are many things in my hometown that I am attached to, I do not have the idea of "returning home, wearing a kerchief, sitting on a basket, and resting my head on a high pillow to watch the mountain scenery." The reason why I am homesick is actually somewhat similar to Li Chunke's mood of exchanging sable fur for wine and writing in the Beijing residence after drinking. His words are:</p>
<p>"I plan to return! Considering the officialdom and reputation of Chang'an, that's all it is. A bustling group of white-necked crows, their nonsense is considered scholarly. It's hard to remember the names of your kind. I just feel like I don't recognize anyone I meet. Where can I find a confidant in the world? It's just me and myself, dealing with each other. There is no place here to get drunk. Even if it's like being a brave warrior, how many are left today? Three bushels of thorns in my chest, everywhere they grow thorns; everything is unsatisfactory. What is the point of comparing Wu Wenzhong, Sui Luwu, and others to the Bronze Bird Terrace? Who is strong? Duke Xi?</p>
<p>Adversity can certainly be endured, and strength can also be resisted, but white-necked birds are difficult to endure! Even if the Thunder God hits monsters and hits a latrine, he can't help but cover his nose and leave!</p>
<p>As for saying that I don't recognize anyone I meet, that's even more true. Everything in the city is full of strangers; their actions, words, and behaviors are all beyond my understanding. They laugh, laughing at things that I don't think are funny; they scold, scolding people that I don't think deserve to be scolded. If they are the ones holding onto the times, then I am running against the times.</p>
<p>I am tired of seeing these ugly types. I need a pure and simple rural life to adjust my taste and wash away the stench of the city!</p>
<p>I am suffering from homesickness.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Today I saw a news item in a certain newspaper titled "Another War Against Li is About to Break Out," which involves me, claiming that Free Talk has also severely attacked me, so these attacked writers are uniting to confront Li, etc. There are two points here that must be brought to the attention of the readers: First, my thoughts and personality have their own standpoints. The writers listed in the aforementioned newspaper naturally include some with good thoughts and personalities, but that doesn't mean they are ideological resonance with me. Second, Free Talk has never attacked me, and I am very confident that I will never be attacked by Free Talk. A few days ago, the author of "Reading Notes," Little Snow, had an article with misunderstandings about my poems and poetry talks, but it was very polite and theoretical research, and cannot be considered an attack. Please publish this letter to avoid misunderstandings among friends. Finally, I would like to add that any literary lackeys who are not loyal to their principles, playing jokes on me in some tabloid or boring news, is like "ants trying to shake a tree" or "throwing dung on Buddha's head," causing me no harm!

<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>(5) The next morning, Zhiguang had already been picked up by Botang's car at around nine o'clock and taken to Ge Gelatuo Road. Although he only knew from Amin that Botang had not seen Yongsun last night, he had already anticipated that Botang had not even found out any news about Yongsun. Sure enough, as he walked up the western stone steps, preparing to open the door at the west end of the passageway, he saw Botang running over from the south corridor with a distressed look, speaking to him:</p>
<p>"I didn't get back until three o'clock last night!"</p>
<p>"Any news?"</p>
<p>"How could there be any news there!"</p>
<p>"So what's the plan now?"</p>
<p>"I plan to discuss and finalize what needs to be done and who needs to be sent at three o'clock today, while waiting for Wenqing's reply before taking action. Let's talk inside. Wenqing called just now, saying he has arrived in the trade, and first inquired about the news here." They sat in the dining hall, and soon, Peiying and Shujin also came in. Later, Botang invited two or three relatives and friends who lived at home to participate. Initially, the discussion was very complex, and the opinions were very inconsistent. Some even suggested quickly finding Wu Jianguang to divine characters, while others suggested quickly finding detectives to search for Yongsun's car in the western district of the French Concession. Finally, Botang compiled a list of the addresses of Yongsun's relatives and friends with whom he had close ties, and after discussing with Zhiguang and Peiyu for a long time, they decided on a two-pronged approach: First, immediately send people to the homes of each relative and friend on the list, saying that something important has happened at home, and if they see Yongsun, please persuade him to return immediately, or notify them immediately by phone; Second, if there is no news and Wenqing is unable to help, then people must be sent to guard the two roads mentioned by Wenqing in sections, to intercept Yongsun's car.</p>
<p>Although the plan was concrete, the selection of people to send out was difficult, especially for the second prong, which required both a large number and capable people. Botang and Zhiguang had to stay at home to prepare for everything, and Peiyu couldn't leave even more. Therefore, Shujin and Shi Wuge and others separated and took several yellow cars, following the first prong's plan, and set off immediately. As for the second prong, after much deliberation, it was decided to divide the two roads mentioned by Wenqing into two security zones, and select Yu Chengzhang, the accountant of Changxing, and Yu Guangzhang, the runner, to each take charge of the security mission in one zone; and instruct them to first assess the terrain and select a public place as the liaison office, and instruct them to select two or three dozen smart and capable people first inside and then outside the factory, and wait for the departure order to patrol the intersections of the two zones in shifts from two o'clock in the afternoon, focusing on intercepting Yongsun's car; in case there is no result, they must also wait until traffic is cut off before withdrawing. So Botang called for people to find the two Yus. At this time, he remembered the matters in the factory, sighed a long sigh, and said;</p>

<h3 id="e268">Discussing the Way Out for Intellectuals <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Bi</p>
<p>Bumping into walls everywhere, where to find a way out? "Looking at the future, I shiver from the cold!"</p>
<p>This is the cry of an intellectual who has been unemployed for a long time, wasted his efforts, and let time pass in vain, deeply stimulated and still without a way to make a living.</p>
<p>Because there is an "oversupply" of knowledge, intellectuals have nowhere to "sell" their knowledge, so a large number of intellectuals become unemployed. In the wave of unemployment, intellectuals are bumping into walls everywhere.</p>
<p>"Where is the way out for intellectuals?" This is a serious problem at the moment. I believe that the first thing to do is to break their traditional ideas of "knowledge is omnipotent" and "character is noble," and to change direction and start from physical labor or productive work. Men might as well become "waiters" or the like, and women might as well become "amah" or the like. But in the current situation of "narrowing market," I also doubt whether my method is effective!</p>
<p>"So where exactly is the way out for intellectuals?" I also thought of the "unintelligent" desperadoes, who are already unemployed. They have already experienced the misfortune that intellectuals are experiencing now. When they are panicked about their livelihoods, their way out is to "steal some" and "rob some"! It is said that they are just going to "steal and return" and "rob and return"! But in the "order of current society," I dare not teach intellectuals to do things that "lose personality" and "commit crimes"!</p>
<p>Therefore, the surplus intellectuals in the current society are finally "without a way out"! Although their "cries" are resounding all around, what is the use of "cries"!</p>
<h3 id="e269">Returning from the National Goods Fashion Exhibition <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>Nanjing Road was already a picture of lights in the evening. The Austin sped over the cobblestones like a gust of wind. A group of volunteer promoters of the fashion exhibition spewed out from the entrance of the Continental Emporium: Reflected by the red and green neon lights, the newly made cheongsams, like western dresses hanging in the laundromat's glass cabinet, also turned red and green. A burst of commotion, the fur of pugs and Pekingese dogs was like a wave. Miss Three and Miss Zhu, carrying large and small bags, jumped into the car. The Austin sped over the cobblestones like a gust of wind.</p>
<p>Miss Three pulled out a colorful silk handkerchief from the jade bracelet on her half-exposed wrist, the fragrance sending into the chauffeur's nostrils, the car body vibrating slightly, but not turning, heading straight towards Jing'an Temple Road. Miss Three gently wiped away the beads of sweat that had trickled down from 4711, smiling and talking to her companion. The delicate, lipstick-covered cherry lips were reflected in the small mirror in front of the chauffeur, the car body vibrating slightly, but not turning, heading straight towards Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>Miss Zhu used her little finger to push the hair rolling in front of her to the back, she felt tired. In the rhythmic frenzy of the car, she was unwilling to say much. She fantasized about the face of the man in the light gray suit, like Mei Lanfang, whom she had met several times at school, seemingly A-Mei's sweetheart.</p>
<p>A group of stars were sent in. The iron gate had already been pulled up, and those who had not squeezed in were cursing words like mother and ancestors. Miss Zhu turned her head back following the cheers, and Mei Lanfang's face almost met hers; Miss Three's gaze was cast on the two dimples of Miss Hu Die, not noticing this evening comedy. Miss Zhu tightened her pair of eyebrows that had been plucked and redrawn, Mei Lanfang took two steps back, she couldn't help but smile slightly, Mei Lanfang squeezed behind her as if someone had snatched away that good position.</p>
<p>Miss Zhu felt the scorching heat coming from his broad chest. The crowd was spinning, Hu Die, Ai Xia, the fur of Pekingese dogs, white faces, red lips, commotion, cheers. She had no more interest in looking, intentionally or unintentionally leaning close to his broad chest, his breath slightly brushing the disordered hair beside her ears, she felt the need for a strong, powerful embrace, like Tarzan of the Apes:: The car stopped in the red light in front of the New World, Miss Three knocked on the glass and said to the chauffeur, "Drive around in a circle"! Miss Zhu blushed, waking up as if from a nightmare, the chauffeur skillfully turned the steering wheel, heading into the green light: Miss Zhu's face was still like a red sunset glow. .</p>
<p>The bustling city area was left behind in the car, flying steeply forward behind her, a surge of heat涌上 from the leather cushions, Miss Zhu fell heavily back into sweet memories.</p>
<p>She was angry that men did not understand women's hearts too much, lacked courage too much, women must maintain the dignity of reserved, such a pretty face, did not understand this kind of suggestion: She squinted back, he only had an emotionless smile. She pretended to stomp her foot, stepping on his, and he timidly retreated::</p>
<p>The car was speeding wildly, a layer of angry frost covering Miss Zhu's sunset face.</p>
<p>Miss Three stared at the large and small packages of clothing materials, the front of her cheongsam was already stained with a bit of grease, those three packs should be done herself. Two pieces of remnant material salvaged from the remnant material department to Mother, saving that old woman from saying that the girl is grown up and does not care for her mother. A piece of Indian silk for Little Xu's request, he always rips me off, Miss Three smiled to herself, she planned to give the extra silk to Father, preparing an excuse to ask for money. Ah! A-Ju, she thought of A-Ju, that little maid's mouth does not have medicine to eat and she chatters, give her the cheongsam.</p>
<p>Miss Three smiled leisurely, Little Xu's strong wrist tempting her in front of her.</p>
<p>A layer of angry frost covered Miss Zhu's sunset face. The car was speeding wildly, the chauffeur looked at his watch, he had to go to the Sanjiang Hotel at nine o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Robbery <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Xiangyun</p>
<p>"Old Wang! Is something wrong?" Fufu was frantically rummaging through</p>
<p>the chest when he suddenly realized an unusual sound coming from afar as a car stopped: honking sounds, followed by a series of leather shoe thuds. He stopped working, pricked up his ears, and seriously lowered his voice, saying:</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>Wang Xiaosi shrewdly glanced out the window, saw several figures, separated and moving under the desolate streetlights, mingled with swaying tree shadows. He spoke while stuffing what he had in his hands into his pockets, pulled out the six-inch Browning pistol from his waist, disengaged the safety, and held it tightly in his palm. In the silent world, the thudding of leather shoes, scattered and gradually growing louder.</p>
<p>"Fufu!" Li Desheng, responsible for monitoring the homeowner, stealthily lowered his footsteps and appeared at the stairwell. He said nervously, "Something's up, everyone downstairs!" As soon as Li Desheng finished speaking, he turned and went downstairs. Fufu turned off the light in quick succession and followed Wang Xiaosi down the stairs from the darkness. At the bottom of the stairs, Little Pockmark and Er'er guarded the closed back door, they gripped their Mauser pistols, while directing their bright eyes at those coming downstairs. Reflected in the pale and flickering flashlight, their purplish-blue faces conveyed a determined sense of sacrifice created by the terrifying and dangerous situation. They all clenched their teeth tightly. Their whole bodies trembled as if assailed by the cold wind that pierces the bones. "Go!" Wang Xiaosi turned his head towards everyone and said. His mouth was twitching.</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"Go up and we'll talk later!"</p>
<p>In the dark, Wang Xiaosi saw them all nod their heads slightly,</p>
<p>"Like this: If you die, Er'er, Little Pockmark, with your equipment, charge forward first, Fufu and Lao Li in the back." With a bang, Wang Xiaosi jumped out of the opened door, and immediately fired at the dark figure hiding in the corner of the wall ahead. Behind him, Er'er and Little Pockmark also jumped out. They all kept their bodies close to the wall as they advanced. They tried their best to hide in the darkness. They were all firing bullets cruelly. The crackling sound and the howling of bullets in the room like a raging wind enveloped them. They were hit by bullets, soaked in blood, but they were still struggling, advancing, quickening their pace.</p>
<p>Because of this disturbance, this howling of flying bullets, the residents nearby also trembled and fell into a state of terror and confusion. But suddenly, everything became silent again. The tree shadows still silently leaked light, swaying on the asphalt road, the green wind knocking against the leaves emitted a cool groan, deeply touching people's hearts.</p>

<h3 id="e271">A Sworn Brotherhood Remembrance Picture <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>It was four years ago.</p>
<p>Chao Ming and Ying Lin, wanting to deepen their friendship as classmates and become sworn brothers, was of course a very ordinary small matter, nothing rare.</p>
<p>In order to emulate Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei's Oath of the Peach Garden, they felt that two people forming a sworn brotherhood was a bit awkward, so they hurriedly found a good classmate, Yu Zhang, to fill the gap.</p>
<p>"Sharing blessings and enduring hardships together"; the sworn brotherhood certificate was clearly printed with eight red characters, they took photos, drank wine, and the procedures were considered complete. Based on age, Yu Zhang was the eldest brother, Ying Lin the second brother, and Chao Ming the third brother. Afterwards, it seemed like everyone was very friendly, living happily.</p>
<p>Gradually, they discovered that the second brother was a bit shy and unwilling to tell the truth about things.</p>
<p>"Second brother, be honest, we're all family now": The third brother couldn't keep things to himself. He couldn't help but advise him every time.</p>
<p>"Oh::" The second brother always had this tone.</p>
<p>":::" The eldest brother remained silent.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the second brother gradually reduced his shyness by more than half.</p>
<p>The second brother was a day student, while the eldest and third brothers lived in the school, so they had more contact time.</p>
<p>One day, the third brother was learning to ride a bicycle on the school's sports field. Because it was his first time, he swayed unsteadily. In a panic, the bicycle bumped into someone.</p>
<p>"Sorry, he's a beginner and wasn't careful," the eldest brother said a few words to the other party in a spirit of mutual apology to smooth things over.</p>
<p>"After all, I'm willing to help you, otherwise, humph: : I'm afraid you would have suffered!" The eldest brother boasted proudly afterwards, a trace of complacent smile hanging on his lips.</p>
<p>"Is this something to make a fuss about, who cares": The third brother finally couldn't bear it.</p>
<p>For more than four years, they persevered through this lack of mutual understanding. What continued to arrive was their final semester of senior year in high school.</p>
<p>The relationship between the eldest and third brothers became increasingly fractured! One was arrogant, the other was upright, irreconcilable like water and fire, but due to the constraints of the treaty! The sworn brotherhood certificate! They had to let the pain strike their hearts, no one had the courage to propose severing ties first. As for the second brother, he was just a bit gentle and did not thoroughly understand everything about the sworn brotherhood, only increasing the distance between the three of them, without any major obstacles.</p>
<p>But after all, the mask is just a mask, and it will be torn off one day.</p>

<p>(Twenty-Six) Zhou Shaoping's Last Letter</p>
<p>"Here is a letter from Zhou Shaoping to you!"</p>
<p>"Did he move to another hospital?" he asked, as the letter was placed in his hand.</p>
<p>"He died after the surgery." The nurse replied expressionlessly and walked away.</p>
<p>Shi Qiao was stunned for a long time, as if a light had suddenly flashed and gone out, blurring his vision. When he took the letter to a quiet place and opened it, he managed to focus his vision, regain a sense of reality, and at the same time felt a gust of cold wind blowing from the street corner. The letter trembled;</p>
<p>"Shi Qiao, my dear friend: I only woke up after you left, and I only realized that you had been accompanying me all the way to the hospital. At around three o'clock in the afternoon, the doctor came to perform the operation. The pain was excruciating, but the bullet still hadn't been removed. According to the doctor, the bullet went in very deep, only an inch away from the lungs. Judging from the expression on his face, I probably have no hope. I fainted from the pain again and again. Now he has given me a heart stimulant, so I can barely hold on. Fortunately, the bullet is stuck under my left armpit, giving me this last chance to write to you. This can be considered very lucky.</p>
<p>My sincere brother Shi Qiao, when a soldier who sacrifices for patriotism is about to die, you can imagine that he always wants to say some impassioned words to encourage his compatriots, or leave gentle and reminiscent words to his parents and children, but I feel that the impassioned emotions have come to an end. This is not because of my weakness and discouragement at death; I also feel that it is unnecessary to just reminisce about parents, and it is not because I am inherently vicious and have no filial piety. It's just that I think that under the current chaotic situation in China, the gentle hometown will eventually be completely destroyed, and a simple spirit of passion is definitely not enough to save ourselves and the country. When I was on the front lines, because my comrades were fighting bravely against the enemy, I didn't want to bring up any fundamental national issues for discussion, as discussion during wartime is most likely to scatter military morale. So I have always hidden the problems I have experienced in my heart. Now I know that I have no hope, at this time, let the words filling my heart flow out. Now I might as well honestly say that this time, my participation in the front line battle was not very happy, in other words, there were many psychological contradictions! First of all, in the army organization and the personnel themselves, the flaws I found were simply unbearable. Those I approached on the front lines were mostly soldiers, but in the lives of the soldiers, I saw a deep gap between them and their superiors. It is normal for superiors to have higher salaries, but during combat, superiors take good care of themselves and are unwilling to die. As for the newspapers, naturally, they are all promoting the superiors, especially this time, the comfort items and money given to the front lines by the rear, this is entirely a little comfort that we exchanged for our blood and sweat, heads, but all of it goes to the superiors layer by layer , to be cut off... The question is, they dare to be angry but dare not speak, although they are still driven by patriotism, they still step forward to take orders.</p>
