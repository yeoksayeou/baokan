<p>＝首都各界請取毅然態度準備與强敵周旋＝</p>
<p>＝政府認爲關係國家整個安危正在協議中＝</p>
<h3>蔣伯誠高凌百到京謁蔣</h3>
<p>（南京）蔣七日晨由湯山入城、至軍校官邸休息、何應歉·朱培德·羅文斡·陳果夫·葉楚傖·等均往晋竭、蔣對榆關事件、有詳細諮詢、關於應付計劃、曾有具體討論、（七日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）首都各界人士、以榆關失陷、華北岌岌可危、非常焦慮、大有談虎色變之槪、擬請願政府、取毅然熊度、集中一切力量、準備與强敵周旋、聞政府認此次事變、關係國家整個安危、應付主針、宜視時局發展之程度而定、關於軍事外交等重要機宜、刻正在協議中、俟日内張學良報告關内外敵軍切實行動後、即當有適當之决定、（七日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）某要人語本報記者、榆關事變、日軍極盡兇殘、詭異行動、愈演愈烈、國府方面、認時局如此嚴重、非自衛不足圖存、國難會議所主張之長期抵抗、當始終弗渝、黨政軍界領袖、已有切實團結、準備應付此艱危之局、所云抵抗、應有通盤計劃、不能僅限於華北一隅、華北軍事、雖應由張學良首負其責、政府方面、尤不容忽視、關於應付策略、蔣委員長刻已返京、正與政府同人作重要協議、至外交方面、我方要求以國際輿論力量相制裁、自未可放棄、惟以年來所得之印象、感覺得中日爭端、陷於不和不戰不生不死之局、我方已吃虧不小、自不得不以自衞力量奮起圖存、若國聯正羲不伸、不僅中國蒙其損害、而世界眞理、將從此涇沒不顯、和平更無法以保障矣、（七日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）蔣伯誠今抵京、當夜赴滬、（七日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）蔣伯誠·高凌百·七日由濟抵京、即晚將謁蔣、面陳要務、讥談、日軍犯榆、韓復榘極憤激、願與全國將領、團結抵抗、（七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）蔣委員長六日由杭抵湯山、下榻俱樂部、七日晨十時、偕隨從乘汽車數輛入城、直駛軍校官邸、朱培德·何應欽·羅文斡·均至軍校晉謁、面陳要務、對榆事亦有商討、午後召見陳紹寬·谷正倫·吳思豫、四時乘車赴陵園休息、晚將召見鮑文樾及蔣伯誠、詢日犯榆經過情表、與華北近况、（七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）蔣軍委長雖已抵此、但今日之會議、皆非正式性質、不過國府要人、互換意見而已、與會者對於時局、皆不願發表意見、軍界方面現有政府辦理榆案不可示弱之趨勢、尤以下級軍官爲甚、但至目前、此問或他處、尚未有顯著之軍事行動、傳說前清遺老現紛紛赴津、蓋望日本軍事當局將挾溥儀在平登極稱帝也、一般輿論以爲張學良終將不能保其地盤、抵抗尚不失榮譽、不抵抗則徒取辱耳（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（南京）今日國府要人會議、内容不詳、惟據可恃方面云、中國當局不欲增重時局、而希望榆案有迅速圓滿之解决、但若日軍進攻秦皇島華軍陣地、或在他處擾亂、則華軍必力拒之、故此後發展、完全操之東京、同時當局已在華北及沿海與長江流域作軍事準備、俾應付或有之緊急事態、今晨蔣軍委長抵此後、即在軍校接見何應欽朱培德等要人、會商至正午、午後蔣赴湯山、明日午後返京、聞參謀部今日午後有重要會議、討論長江沿海及華北防務、（七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>國聯十九國特委會凖本月十六日召集</h3>

<h3>西班牙撤換出席日内瓦代表</h3>
<p>（南京）十九國特委會原定本月十六日開會、現因榆關事、我代表曾要求提早開會、據外交界息、十九國特委會仍將如期開會、對中日爭端諒難有何進展、（七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國總代表顏惠慶博士今晨往晤國聯秘書長德魯蒙、聞此係新年拜訪之性質、但遠東時局勢必討論及之、十九特委會定一月十六日集議、衆料中代表將催請提早開會、但中代表現未有此申請、惟密切注視各種發展耳、十九特委會主席比外相希孟大約將於一月十四日抵此、與秘書長德魯蒙商榷此後行動力途徑、國聯方面對於調和手續、極抱悲觀、認爲失敗無疑、預料十九特委會集議時、將被迫放棄國聯盟約第十五條之第三節、而研究根據同條第四節所可辦理之事、據有資格者之意見、如有繕發報告書之必要、則此報告書約可於半月内商成之、中國態度顯漸堅硬、故和解氣象愈見黯淡、國聯方面以爲中國或將抛棄其從前消極辦法、而在日内瓦及遠東改取一種較嚴厲之行動、此舉殊適合粤方旨趣、因近來粤方常電致中代表促其堅持勿讓云（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日此聞外交界消息、西班牙出席國聨代表馬達利亞加、因於去年十一月及十二月間討論中日爭執時、有逾越權限行爲、發表未經政府許可之反對日本意見、業爲政府切責、已呈辭國聯代表及駐法大使、將量移他處、聞下次日内瓦開會時、或將由閣員蘇路泰出席、（七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國送致日本之牒文、抗議日軍之侵入榆關及要求懲辦肇事軍官、並保留要求賠償等等之本文、今日已由中國總代表顏惠慶博士送達國聯、請其轉交國聯大會及十九國委員會、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中代表今日照會國聯秘書處、請國聯儘速採行有效方法制止日軍在華北之行動、並謂榆關乃長城以南之最後險塞、今日軍竟襲取之、今後日軍可隨時直下天津與熱河、又謂中國軍事當道將盡力抵抗日軍之繼續侵略（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）據東報所載、昨日駐英大使林德賽訪内田外長、關於中日紛爭提新妥協案、此案係十二月三十一日西門外長與特魯蒙密商結果所擬之案、英大使謂、英國在華利益與日本相近、故無意阻害日本之新發展、但國聯西子亦要顧及、否則世界混亂、不堪設想、英日同受其害、英案旨趣在敷衍世界輿論、在實質上帮助日本在遠東新得之地位、望日政府審愼考慮、其提案内容爲㈠不請美俄參加調解、尊重日本主張、㈡調解委員會不明定權限、以英·法·德·意·比·及中日七國組織、拒絕小國參加、（七日華聯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>一九三三年如何上乃</h3>
<p>時序推移。又屆歲首一九三三年之世界。一九三三年之中國。將陷於如何之狀態。將起如何之變化乎。此不獨帝國主羲侵略下之中國人民。盤旋腦海。欲一求解答以爲快。即舉世之上。稍具知識之人。恐亦無有不耿耿於懷者。自一九二九以至於今日。瀰漫全世界之經濟恐慌。旦夕滋長。猛進不已。恐慌之動機。爲一切商品之生產過剩。生產過剩之結果。爲一般物價之跌落。物價跌落之不已。甚至商品出售之所得。不足以抵償生產費。生產者遂不得不裁汰工人。減縮其生產矣。工人之裁汰。自列强間盛倡產業合理化。採用新式機械。改良工廠組織後。已兆端倪。生產過剩以　。風行尤厲。因遂造成極嚴重之失業問題。隨失業人數之增加。復致一般購買力之銳減。生產剮剩之狀態乃益急劇。生產過剩與失業互爲因果。循環往復。遂造成此不可藥救之現局　　數年來爭持紛擾於國際間者。普泛的如關稅休戰問題。軍縮問題。及戰債問題。持種的如中日問題。殆均爲生產過剩經濟恐慌必然的產物。列强因國内生產之過剩。消極的不得不增高關稅壁壘。以制止他國產品之輸入積極的復不得不擴張軍備。以進行殖民地之略取。幻想者流。乃遂欲以三寸不爛之舌。折衝樽俎。挽此狂瀾。此關稅休戰會議及軍縮會議之所由起也。戰債問題之所以嚴重若此。則因關稅壁壘增高以後。德意志已不能復以其剩餘商品。作償付賠欵之用。以現金繳付賠欵。復爲勢所不能乃公然宣告賠欵之無力續付。歐洲各國。復連帶以賠欵之停付。而主張停付對美之戰債。在資本主義之下。國家之强盛。固有待於資產階級之努力掠奪。國家財政之收入。亦賴掠奪餘之分潤。經濟恐慌以後。貿易銳減。產業凋零。往昔恃爲國家主要財源之關稅所得稅營業稅等。收入胥受重大之打擊。遂至此一般人所認爲黃金國之美國。預算竟無由均衡。財政之枯竭若此。詎復能慷慨以允許此鉅數戰債之停付。此戰債問題之所以一再爭持而莫决也。此外若中日問題。其爲日本帝國主義過剩商品澎漲必然之結果。記者在「今後日本帝國主義對華之行動」一文。曾祥加論列。國際間一切之演變。無能逃於經濟關係之策動。蓋甚顯矣。</p>
<p>盛衰循環之說。不特爲吾國先哲樂道。歐西經濟學者。亦嘗認爲至理。即所謂。恐慌週期律是也。吾人對於恐慌週其律。並不欲加以根本之否認。惟有須加以修正者。則人類自有史以來。無一成不變之制度。新陳代謝。輝煌燦爛之文化。乃賴以完成。故恐慌週期之於社會制度。猶之歲月推移之於人生。一度循環。生命之内容。早已變更。由幼稚而少壯。由壯而長老。由長老而衰病。由衰病而死亡。同時幼少代興。人類之延綿如故。而人種改良。則方日進而不息。制度之必須變更。正如人生之必須經生老病死而更替，故所謂恐慌週期云者。爲走馬燈式的循環。而爲螺旋式的前進。蠶經三眠。漸變乃　。三眠之間。涵義自各不同。「歲月催人老」者。恐慌週期亦在繼續不斷的催促。現制度由幼稚而全盛。由全盛而衰亡。現制度之必須在某一恐慌之下。壽終正寢者。吾人迴溯人麵社會之歷史。帝族一般人生的過程。而知其無可避免也。</p>

<h3>俄報評論榆案</h3>
<p>日軍犯榆僅爲攻熱先聲</p>

<h3>日本大舉擴張軍備</h3>
<p>＝充實軍備應付國際鬥爭＝</p>
<p>＝侵略華北繼續秘密運兵＝</p>
<p>東京通信、日本長閥旣已露骨的侵略「滿洲「、然而牠很恐懼中國奮起爭鬭、許多人以爲是牠怕列强干涉、其實列强沒有力量干涉、特别是美國現時沒有法子在西太平洋作戰是日本薩長兩閥所審知的事、固然牠對於列强尤其是對赤俄的戒備、對中國則只有進一步的侵略、我們看牠財政部最近所發表的預算案、陸軍費就有四四七·八八三千圓日金、其中兵備改善費一一四·六四五千圓日金、而侵略東北經費、陸海軍·外務·財政·及遞信·各部費用合計共有一八六·三三○千圓日金、由上述數字、我們知道有兩種特殊事實的表現、第一是實施其所謂軍備改善、第地理對「滿」增兵、</p>
<h3>軍備改善</h3>
<p>所謂軍備改善、其來源有兩種、一種是鑑於國際形勢、凡是陸軍國的軍備、其器械的設備都非常精良、飛行機·坦克車·毒瓦斯都有均稱的配備、蘇聯且有四個機械師團、第二種是新兵器的使及、在日本的訓練、非但欠缺精幹、而且數量也很少、如果一旦遇着眞面目的戰爭、則日本陸軍頗不容易應付敵人、所以捷積極着手於改善其軍備、改善的主要項目大體如下、</p>
<p>㈠充實下级幹部、增加將校及軍事學校學生的額數、（據傳第一步爲十萬人）、</p>
<p>㈡爲補充現時中少尉之不足起見、實行短期志願將校制度、</p>
<p>㈢補充平時及戰時將校不足起見、增加特務曹長之額數、</p>
<p>㈣廢止捐金制度、使兵役義務貧富均等、使豫備役和後備役幹部之補充、適當合理、</p>
<p>㈤新設特科下士官之養成機關、（如坦克車及化學學校等）</p>
<p>㈥採用（十八歲以下）的幼年兵去作通信兵和航空兵、</p>
<p>㈦擴張飛行隊和坦克車隊、（預備擴張到現時的二倍）、</p>
<p>㈧新設毒瓦斯防護敎育機關、（彷蘇聯制度、普及於一般社會、自兒童以至婦女皆受此種敎育、）</p>
<p>㈨就現有各部隊施行毒瓦斯防護敎育</p>
<p>㈩整備現有軍用警犬及偵犬、</p>
<p>上述十項的用費、約計一千二百萬圓日金、今年一月即開始施行、</p>
<p>至於各師團的改善、就目前的形勢、表面上還得顧到華盛頓條約的關係、所以不便增加常備兵師團的單位、於兵員的增加、也是現時國情所不許的、於是　努力於内容的充實、在各師團中增加飛行機·裝甲汽車·坦克車·平射砲·無線電通信隊·等均須增加、其目的要能夠達到拖的任務不受地域間隔的困難、特别是在東三省的各部隊要大大的擴充、（要能夠制著東北義勇軍、同時更要能夠隨時侵入熱河及山海關以内）作戰的材料方面、則輕重機關槍·步兵砲·擲彈筒·輕榴彈砲·以至於毒瓦斯防護·氣象觀測·地形觀測之各種新器具·衛生材料·獸醫材料等、都加以更週密更廣大的設備、其經費總計約九百二十九萬圓日金、</p>
<h3>對滿增兵</h3>
<p>對侵略華北、牠表面上不好說進攻、也不好說對「滿」增兵、所以只用常駐軍交代之名、把死傷過多衛戍已久的第二師團調回去、而以第六師團去代替、該師團駐「滿」期間、據參謀本部的規定爲一九三三年四月到一九三四年四月、但是實際上鹿兒島第三十六旅團在一九三二年十一月底、即已接到動員令、十二月初即已出發、現時已全部到達遼寗及錦州一帶、</p>
<p>同時習志野騎兵第一旅團、在北滿作戰死傷過重、於是又從津田治（車站）運出補充兵約一千五百名、軍馬千餘匹、宇都宮（車站）也運出騎兵士卒千餘、軍馬千匹以上、其他各種兵器、都是秘密搬運、不讓一般人知道、（因爲军輸上車時都在夜間十二時後、不過總有人會曉得、）九洲方面、地域較小、又多在海邊、所以很容易遮掩耳目、現在除對九洲的軍運不可统計之外、把經過鹿島·已斐·向津各車站的軍隊、戰傷兵士、以及骸骨、每次有多少雖很難得悉、但是運送的回數、由某某等車站工人的暗記如下、</p>
<p>軍隊運送　三○八回</p>
<p>傷兵運送　　九八回</p>
<p>骸骨　　　　五六回</p>
<p>這是去年九年到今年十一月止的一個小統計、當然這中間還有遺漏、只會有多、絕不會少、此刻　的六師團旣已到遼、恐怕不僅止於換防、即對熱河對山海關等邊境、不免會有更驚人的舉動罷、（十二月三十一日）</p>

<h3>哈禮士先生肖像</h3>
<p>哈禮士先生爲坎拿大永明人壽保險公司之駐華總理。在該公司任職。預計至本年四月三日。適滿念一年。最近之十年。乃在上海擔任總理職務。以前之十一年。則在倫敦爲該公司襄贊一切、哈禮士先生之一生。完全注力於壽險事業。彼爲中國壽險公會之會長。於業務之外。彼亦熱心贊助公益事業。如兼任扶輪社之正會長。及靑年會之副會長是也。至彼所代表之永明公司。乃全世界最大壽險公司之一。創立迄三十年。在中國經營壽險之公司。當推該公司爲先進。且亦爲中國政府債券之大投資家。對於中國各種事業之發展。常與以有力之贊助焉。</p>
<h3>人壽保險之認識及其益</h3>
<p>（本文著者。爲人壽保險問題公認之作家。致力斯業。已有三十餘載。其發軔時。自倫敦赴加拿大。服務於永明公司ＳunＬifeＡssuranceＣo,ofＣanada之壽險專門計算部。繼又同時務於宏利公司ＭanufacturersＬifelnsuranceＣompany之計算部。不數稔。即與同志創辦永康公司ＣrownＬifeＩnsuranceＣo,於杜倫都。Ｔoronto任辦事董事。旋受上海永年公司ＣhinaＭutualLifeInsuraliceCo,ofShanghai之聘。來滬担任該公司之改組事宜。任辦事董事。繼又辭職以組織華安合羣保壽股份有限公司。ChinaUnitedAssuranceSooiety,Ltd,該公司純粹華商資本。爲民元革命所喚起。以改進國家經濟爲已任。實開中國保壽事業之先河。著者助爲組織。任司理名譽董事等職。已越二十載）。</p>
<h3>人壽保險　郁賜Ｓ，Ｊ，Ｈughes,</h3>
<p>人壽保險之定義。若不用艱深之科學名詞。殊難以寥寥數語表明之。此種大而有益之社會組織。若在别國。本已家喻户曉。毌庸再作學理上之解釋。獨在中國。此種公衆之了解與好感。似尚缺如。全年之通國保壽數目。恐尚不及外國公司一家一個月之營業。故在此稍占篇幅。似可見恕於讀者。</p>
<p>簡單言之。人壽保險之各種保法。似均可以謂爲一種賠償。此種賠償。係預付少數之費。以爲大宗損失之担保。此種損失。在規定之年期内。有實現亦有不實現者。火險水險。因其需要更易使人明瞭。蓋若所保之險。在投保人之生存期内發生。則本人可以得到賠償。故其普及較易。</p>
<h3>過去之發展頗遲</h3>
<p>人壽保險。因實在得益者复投保者本人。而爲身後其他之人。故公衆對彼之好感。傳佈甚慢。投保壽險者。不但爲一已之幸福。且須具有天性之親愛。進一步爲其仰事俯蓄者着想。至其本人。所得乃在已盡爲人子·或爲人夫·或爲人父　之責任之安慰。及平日之高枕無憂耳。壽險在防已身之不測。使依靠之者有備而無患。而壽險事實之例。亦即使人保壽之勸導法也。</p>
<h3>起於數世紀以前</h3>
<p>人壽保險之起源。尚在數世紀以前。朋好相約。醵錢賙恤先故者之遺屬。此即保壽制度之濫觴。除中國外。全球此種制度。現已大爲風行。而爲關於社會·關於經濟。之人類報福的生存要件。向之僅爲少數個人相互私約者。今已蔚爲專門之事業。凡有生產能力之人。其生命價値。所需保障不測之代價若干。已由偶發率與人生壽限之科學應用。而得確切之之統計矣。</p>
<h3>偉大之意味</h3>
<p>人壽保險之事業。除其本身之專門科學以外。更須高深之數學、統計學、理財學、經濟學、商業管理學、醫學、法學、等種種專門技能爲之輔佐。本文祇爲講述保壽大意之首篇。故於各種應用之實學。未遑詳論。所述者。祇人壽保險於個人及社會之幸福。與國家經濟之進步。有若何偉大之意味耳。」保壽之由保雖古。但其被採爲社會組織之中堅事業。則年代尚新。其最近所遭公共之認識。當爲上次世界之大戰。故美國胡佛總統。於此次大選競爭中。嘗有演說述。及保壽。謂上次世界之大戰。各國喪失之壯丁。達四千萬。因使人心之之中。深植保壽有效之觀念。不但深感保壽事業之救濟。且極明瞭人生當早保壽以預防。此種觀念之深植。在保壽事業之歷史中。當以上次世界之大戰爲第一次也。</p>
<h3>可驚之進展</h3>
<p>自彼時起。人壽保險。可爲生產者突然身故後。倚之爲生者。藉以恢復一部份金錢損失寓之最簡便。最穩妥、及最經濟之方法。乃被公衆更廣大之認識與接受。在近來之十五年至二十年中。人壽保險。有可驚之進展。若按户口之多寡爲衡。則推北美合衆國及加拿大爲最盛。即邇來經濟衰落之影響。不但未嘗阻滯其進步。抑反有所激進之。美國之經濟衰落。以一九三一年爲最烈。而是年保壽總額及資產之增加。亦破以前之紀錄。綜計上年之末。合衆國保壽公司之資產總額。併本年增加之一三二○三八九○○○金元在内。共達美金二○○○○○○○○○○元以上。</p>
<h3>中國可以採用</h3>
<p>人類之進化不絕。社會之演進無窮。人壽保險乃因進化之需要而有可驚之發展。此種有益之制度。在他國極度發達者。中國未嘗不可採用之。以求人民於社會方面、經濟方面之幸福。會當另文詳方之。著者從事保壽。幾四十年。各項事務。均曾親歷。凡有所言。當非毫無經騐者比。</p>
<p>總而言之。人壽保險。乃人羣合作以增進人類幸福最良法則之一。使富力平民化。得平允之支配。而無赤貧之人。保壽公司。所集之鉅資。乃人類各種優良之心理。如智慧、節險、與犠牲。藉物質以所爲之表現。世人有欲以社會學說、共產學說、代替多年發展而成之經濟制度者乎。此保壽公司所代表之國家富力。即集食力民衆所儲之鉅資。足以鼓勵及報酬人類之良心者。足爲彼輩完美之答案。世界日在改進之中。而此人們一方自助、一方合作之奇特制度。經悠久之試騐。緣社會之需要。而爲人所採用者。今乃盛昔焉。</p>
<h3>人壽保險的意義及其利益</h3>
<p>— 陳克勤</p>
<p>（一）意義</p>
<p>人壽保險爲多數人。各出相當醵金準備賠償其中任何人因死亡。殘廢。以及衰老所受經濟損失的一種方法。從社會的立塲上說。人壽保險是積蓄資金以賠償因死亡。殘廢等所受經濟損失的方策。這種損失由個人或少數人轉移於衆人共同担負之。</p>
<p>就個人的一般言論。人壽保險是由投保人出保費。當遇死亡或期他特定事情發生時。保險人即賠償投保人或其受益人以規定欵項的互惠契約。保險人可爲個人。自動組織。公司。或是政府。受益人可爲投保人（通稱保户）的家屬。產業商業組織或是對於投保人的生命有密切關係的任何人。這種關係就是受益人對於被保人的。値得投保價的關係。</p>
<p>（二）利益</p>
<p>人壽保險的最要功効。爲置設個人的壽險產業以代替生命的價値。此外。壽險仍包含其他各種經濟的需要。可爲以下諸點的準備。</p>
<p>㈠爲身後償還債務之用。㈡爲贖還抵押之用。</p>
<p>㈢爲擔保兒女敎育費用。㈣準備巨欵以爲捐助之用。</p>
<p>㈤爲準備家庭月金之用。㈥準備進欵以備殘疾時給養之用。</p>
<p>㈦準備老年退職時休養園林之用</p>
<p>㈠爲身後償還債務之用。</p>
<p>在今日經濟情形之下。任何人尤其是家主當去世時。簡直不能說沒有未償的債務。如電。火。衣食。房租。醫藥等。欠欵。這種。積欠的總計。實爲家屬的負担。不過藉付清（Ｃlear-up）壽險保單能準備欵項償還。</p>
<p>㈡爲贖還抵押之用。</p>
<p>以住屋估抵押品的借欵。當家主死亡時爲家屬應首先清償的債務。所以有抵押債務的人。可預先投保與抵押額相等的壽險。當不及預料的死亡來臨時。債務可以保險金清償之。如此家主可担保在他身後。妻子兒女們的有房屋可住。並可團聚在一起。過他們習以爲常的安閒生活。</p>
<p>㈢爲兒女敎育費用的担保</p>
<p>高等敎育在國内已日趨重要。兒女們將來的幸福完全基賴於靑年時所受的訓練。大學敎育甚至於中等敎育皆需金錢爲後盾。所以做父母的。當他們沒有過世之先。應準備一筆兒女受高深敎育的基金。這種基金可藉父母的壽險準備之</p>
<p>㈣準備巨欵爲捐助之用。</p>
<p>遺贈慈善組織或敎育機關的產業。往往因後嗣訟訴的煩繁。稅賦的複雜。法律手續的冗贅等等緣因。不能迅速的解决。但受贈的機關每亟需現欵。在今日情形之下。現金比無限期的將來才可領取。欵項對於它們的功用大的多。人壽保險可使贈與人當死亡的時候。受贈者能即刻領取現金。</p>
<p>㈤爲準備家庭月金之用</p>
<p>今日另有一種保單準備受益人於相當年限之内。每月可向公司領取月金。如此。保户雖然死亡他的家屬仍有生活費用的供給。大多數壽險保單上皆能給子嗣領欵至若干年的權利。惟不幸利用這方法的人仍很少。受益人當領得一筆巨欵後每因經騐缺乏做種種無益的糜費。或投資於無價値的企業上。終身年金保單担保保户的子嗣可按時領取一定進欵。故不致有大宗欵項落於毫無經騐的子嗣手中。或是無謂的浪費或受人的欺騙作無益的投資。即使非終身年金保單。定期年金保單已夠供給家屬的瞻養費。直至兒女們已受充分敎育能自立并有餘力供給别人。</p>
<p>㈥準備進欵以備殘廢時之給養</p>
<p>多數保單規定當保户因遭意外不測而致全部或局部殘廢時。保單仍爲有效的優待條件。這種條例的内容以及保户因殘廢可享受的利益。各有不同之點。惟大約言之有下列三事。</p>
<p>（甲）殘廢期間的保費。可不必繳納，</p>
<p>（乙）按每千貨幣（如金元銀元盧比等）保額每月付保户十貨幣。</p>
<p>（丙）公司到契約到期時。照票面額付給保户或受益人。不滅去因殘廢未繳納的保費額。</p>
<p>凡此種種對於一般專依賴個人工作進欵而生活的人。有很大的利益。因爲殘廢比天逝更使他們感覺困難。按調查所得的結果。在美國新壽險保單中百分之三十八有殘廢優待的條件。公司每年因以上緣因允許付出的償金額起過二十二萬萬元。</p>
<p>㈦準備老年退職時休養園林之用</p>
<p>於美國社會人士關於壽險有益於家庭諸點。已有很澈底的認識。但關於準備老年退職時給養的用費。仍漢然視之。最近幾省中因調查老年依人爲活總數的結果。才引起年金問題的重視。任何人當爲家屬已有充分準備後。也應當顧慮到他生產年齡過去後自已的生活問題。藉人壽保險可準備其家屬依賴他生活時的給養。當家屬可立自時他可變更其保單上的現金値爲年金。以爲他本身老年時的瞻養準備。</p>

<p>特一法院昨審三友廠資方行賄案</p>
<h3>丨丨丨官諭改期再審丨丨丨</h3>
<p>滬東引翔港三友實業社勞資糾紛、自經法院判决後、資方一面提起上訴、一面則派人使向七區棉織業工會常務理事龔雨亭行賄、請停止進行會務、當由龔將賄洋二百元送呈、並將經過情形報告工會·社會局、工會方面以資方公然賄賂、有犯刑章、乃延魏文翰律師撰狀、起訴於第一特區法院、法院准狀後、曾於去年十二月二十七日、開第五刑庭傳訊、因被告沈九成未到、官諭改期再審、昨日爲續審之期、茲紀審理詳情如次、</p>
<h3>開審情形</h3>
<p>昨日下午二時、由推事劉毓桂偕同書記官、黃海雲升坐第五刑庭審訊、原告代理人張文海·龔子愼、辯護律師魏文翰·被告沈九成·王顯華·陳萬運·岑子厚·勞惠民·李道發、辯護律師譚毅公·俞鍾駱·及證人龔雨亭、均準時到庭、首由法官訊據被告沈九成供稱、本人對三友實業社職務、確於去年十一月二十五日交卸、上次因在杭養病、不能到案、此次係帶病出庭等語、</p>
<h3>證人供詞</h3>
<p>繼訊證人龔雨亭供稱、三友代公司對於勞資糾紛、不謀正當途徑解决、竟派代表李道發、勞惠民串通工人夏中昭等、於去年十一月初、囑本人至大世界接談、繼開東方旅館、本人以糾紛雖未角决、晤談當無不可、故不之疑、如約而往、雙方晤談之下、並無若何意見、故無結果而散、同月底、復由夏中昭通知本人、囑至大江南飯店搂洽、未去、同年十二月三日、夏中昭云、現在公司方面、已囑我交一百元與汝應用、汝出收據給我可也、彼時本人、不允而罷、又於本月六日、夏中昭通知我至中洲旅館二百二十八號陳姓房間内、與被告勞惠民等談叙、我乃應約而往、至時見有勞惠民·李道發·夏中海·夏中昭·鄭相榮·等在座、當由勞惠民聲言、公司對於夏中昭及汝二人願以千元爲酬、其他負責者以二千元分給、祇要爾二人不進行會務、糾紛隨便會員自動解决可耳、本人當時祇得表面敷衍、受欵後、隨即報告工會、將賄洋送呈社會局、有收據可憑、</p>
<h3>改期更審</h3>
<p>旋庭上以案情尚須調查、夏中昭有傳訊之必要、遂諭改期本月十一日下午二時再審、彼時該廠工人、在庭旁聽甚衆、被告辯護律師、恐工人出而包圍、乃當庭請爲制止、當由庭上勸諭旁聽工人、汝等對於勞資糾紛、靜候依法解决、不能作無益舉動、致干法典、乃諭工人先退、</p>
<h3>已故鉅商邱渭卿遺產訟爭續審</h3>
<p>≡六旬庶母與養子對簿≡</p>
<p>已故顏料鉅商邱渭卿身後、其螟蛉子長生、被庶母孫氏·姑母朱邱氏（渭卿胞妹·）以圖佔遺產及未成年親生子女長蔭等安全撫養爲由、訴諸第一特區法院、去年歲暮審訊情形、曾誌本報、昨日（七日）午後、由該院錢推事開第二法庭更新審理、首由自訴代理律師章士釗聲明請撤銷第二被告常潄六·第三被告任鎰安·蓋已查明一切、均係第一被告邱長生主動、不欲多有牽累也、邱孫氏由人扶掖立原告欄、朱邱氏因病未到、陳述起訴意旨、因耳聾對答不便、經代理人章士釗律師起立代陳第一自訴人孫氏、爲已故邱渭卿副室、第二自訴人朱邱氏、爲渭卿胞妹、渭卿生前、將其妾賈氏所生女淑英·子長蔭·繼入孫氏名下爲子、由其撫養、又因嫡妻周氏領養、</p>
<h3>螟蛉子長生</h3>
<p>已及成年、恐其生子女孤弱、受親蹂躪、特於病中遺囑、所有財產、均交胞姪省三代管、俟親生子女及年、始准交付長蔭等承受、不料十四年正月、渭卿病故、長生卽將全部遺產、由省三之手、奪回分割、長生以螟蛉子竟奪取十之四五、以十之五五入親子長蔭名下、置親女淑英於不問、親屬間對此</p>
<h3>違法分割事</h3>
<p>均不列名預聞、孫氏不忍目覩、遂赴杭養病、蓋兩親生子女、尚有其生母賈氏撫育、不患有他、不料去年三月四日、賈氏又復病故、被告長生、急起利用機會、恃强奪開保管鐵箱、意圖盜竊、經同鄉戚友不平、鳴捕制止、遂由捕房派捕看管、至十餘日之久、再以同孚路住宅而堂堂丈夫不甘受婦人批顂</p>
<h3>金錢萬惡遭人欺陵</h3>
<p>小麻子氣憤自縊</p>
<p>浦東爛泥渡北東楊家宅三百九十五號靖江人劉文炳即小麻子、年三十歲、向在小涉渡鐵廠内作工、因欠住在護塘街二百零八號同鄕人曹孟氏之債務、前日該氏前往、向劉索討無着、該氏悍潑、即伸手將劉批頰數下、劉以堂堂丈夫、遭婦人之掌頰、實屬羞見人羣、如此環境、無非金錢作祟、一時氣憤、遂於下午背人在家中自縊身死、惟劉僅有一胞妹劉阿寳、共居一處、歸而覺察、施救不及、報告三區警署、將該氏拘押、昨日飭地保謝阿龍投地方法院報騐、奉委張檢察官等蒞塲騐明、諭由家屬收殮候核、</p>
<p>論、原爲親子長蔭所分受者、亦爲長生佔據不交、長蔭等生母賈氏在日、防止長生謀害、設備甚嚴、一宅分爲地部、中以電網相隔、今被告竟乘渭卿賈氏先後喪亡</p>
<h3>將孤兒財產</h3>
<p>生命竊取、置其掌握之下、美其名曰組織保管委員會、實則務使長蔭等與親屬遠離、而後能遂其侵害之奸謀也、故第一自訴人以養母之親、第二自訴人以旁系血親之姑母身分、均不能預聞兩孤之撫育、而被告長生之蓄謀侵害、又顯有案證可稽、特共同提起自訴、請求依法懲處云云、被告辯護律師起稱、自訴人邱孫氏、曾立據與邱氏脫離關係、卽無告爭之餘地、第二自訴人與賈氏無親屬關係可言、卽根本的不能適用自訴法條起訴、本案應先在程序上請求駁斥、自訴代理律師鄭文楷辯稱、脫離據係被告當日</p>
<h3>以詐術騙取</h3>
<p>能否有效成立、此爲民法上問題、根本不能與本案相關、况孫氏以六十衰年、斷無於其夫死後與其養子脫離家屬關係之法理人情、故孫氏自爲被害人之一、前已具狀陳明、至朱邱氏於其胞兄死後、被人違反遺言、奪分財產、對於遺孤、又不依法召開親屬會議、使得共盡監護之責、卽其個人法益、亦已顯被侵損、均有訴求排除之必要理由等語、錢推事乃諭稱、程序法上見解、雙方毋庸多辯、本院依法進行、逢有</p>
<h3>法律上根據</h3>
<p>不過長蔭等向歸孫氏撫育、不難於脫離據中見之、被告應試行在外和解、以合人情法理、依法自訴案經自訴人撤銷者、且應徵求檢察官同意、一案適用公訴或自訴、原聽當事人自擇、初無大别、本案旣係家庭問題、最好雙方協商和息、否則應各盡舉證之能事、以期速結云云、自訴代理律師因被告前次抗傳未到、請求交保、奉諭先由王律師保出、交隨傳隨到舖保而散</p>
<h3>呑烟泡紅丸後自知將死伏榻大哭</h3>
<p>自殺有難言之隱</p>
<p>潘詳富眞眞可憐</p>

<h3>「誰是罪惡的製造者」</h3>
<p>丨汪立德君來訊</p>
<p>參閱十二月二十九日本欄</p>
<p>十二月二十九日貴報載吳嘉英君所提出的問題是··「誰是罪恶的製造者？」意思是要解釋上海跳舞塲的舞女與舞客所演出的男女交際的悲劇的主脚是舞女，因爲她是主動，而男子爲被動。所以他很肯定地說：「明明主動者是原告，而被動者反犯强姦的刑章，個人的犯罪成立在此，社會的造成惡劣的原因亦在此。」其實這恐怕是吳君的主觀的見解。我們要問現在都市的跳舞塲是以什麽目的產生的？是應什麽需要產生的？老實說，現在的跳舞塲就是變相的「賣淫，」並且不是「長三」牌予的賣淫，而是「么二」的賣淫，甚至是大馬路上的臺妓，下等者則等於四馬路，北京路的野鷄。在現在的爲商品生產的產業都市或大商埠中，大多數的女子自然也逃不脫生產合理化結果丨人口過乘的公例，她們找不到工作，失業，自然要流而爲娼妓，京是把她的勞動力變一個方式，來供給有錢的人的精神上的壓榨；舞女也就是現在這種失業女子用這種方式出賣她的勞動力的更高的形態。舞女和人跳舞，並不是普通交際塲中兩相情願的兩性的跳舞，她是隨着舞客的自由選擇的，她沒有自由選擇客人與之跳舞的權力，這與堂子裏接客，應局票是一樣的，所以舞女同男子發和戀愛的關係，除非現行犯罪的行爲，當塲由原告控訴以外，我們便不能認舞女爲被人强姦，因爲實際上，她不但以跳舞供人取樂，並有末以肉體資人縱慾，這是必然的趨勢，也是普遍的事實。然而若果舞客便拿這種說法，做他無罪的辯護，那又錯了。我們旣然認定跳舞塲是賣淫的塲所，那你旣然到了賣淫的地方，你本來就是要去勾搭舞女的，「進了是非地，便中中非人，」旣然進了是非之地，你便是來尋是非的，怎樣盡把主動的罪名，捺到舞女身上，這却有點不「恕」道。我要說一句公平話，舞女與舞客，「一邊半觔，一邊八兩」。舞女告人，實，在是無理鬧，或則因中途被人遺棄而不得不相見於法庭，或則因舞客有幾文，藉此敲竹槓，總而方之，倒楣的私有制度的社會害死人，她們終日地耳濡目染，隨在都鼓勵她們去犯這種罪惡；舞客之中，拆白黨頂多，專門騙舞女睏覺的，所在多有，固然也有一些公子哥兒被她們騙的，然而若說男子盡爲被動，那實在不公平，也非事實。所以舞女舞客公開地宣淫這種罪惡，是現在都市社會的必然現象，那麽，現在的都市社會是這種罪惡的製造者了；查是我們又問：現在的都市社會又是什麽結果呢？那就是現在的私有制度的生產方法與生產關係所形式的，那天，追本窮源，吳君所謂「罪恶的製造者，」就是上述的社會學的度的生產關係了。用我們的唯物論的社會學的眼光來觀察現社會的舞塲，牠實在是犯罪的所在地。若果要設法「除去這種原因，」那只有一方面大家起來做「拔本塞源」的工夫，改造這一製造罪惡的淵藪。一方面大家儘可能地提倡正當的如樂或鼓勵靑年研究學術的興趣，侃靑年减少置身跳舞塲的機會，這是一。一方面，從社會方面儘可能地給女子找工作，侃她們大多數有了正當職業，另一方面也讓她們同樣地享受正當的社交，正當的娱樂，同樣地鼓勵她們讀書，研究學術，增進她們向上的志趣，誰願去做這「文明的皮肉生涯？」這是二。然而「拔本塞源」的工夫，若果不加速度進行，則後而兩種辦法，都不過「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，」其效亦可覩已。明白這一點，那「上海沒有跳舞塲是否能减少犯罪的人？上海沒有跳舞塲是否能减少上海社會的劣點？」等等問題，出就迎刄而解了。因爲上海的跳舞塲乃是上海社會的產物；而上海社會劣點。却不是上海跳舞塲的產物。</p>

<p>也是勝南星　南星球藝、頗多進步、但昨晚不料以二分之差、敗於也是、上半時南星曾以六分佔徺、比數爲二十五比十九、下半時被也是反敗爲勝、結果成四十五比四十三、觀此比數、競爭情形、可見一斑、</p>

<p>▲滬江克夏光　前二十分鐘之競爭、形勢殊爲緊張、良以夏光亦非等間之輩、屢挫動敵、實力雄厚、兩隊分庭抗禮、互有建樹、比數非常接近、滬江僅以二十四比十九佔先、下半時、滬江聲勢突盛、馮念華吳國霖、尤見驍勇、迭見奇功、後方孫寳慶陸鍾惠、戒備嚴寗、無懈可擊、故夏光頗少得分、卽爲强悍之陳寳球、亦難顯其所長、结果滬江乃以六十一比三十一大勝、</p>

<p>孫錦順畢竟不凡平地一聲雷優游勝法商</p>
<h3>西聯會甲組賽初次勝利</h3>
<p>＝結果三與一之比＝</p>
<p>＝孫錦順獨得二球＝</p>
<p>名將身手、畢竟不凡、優游得孫錦順黃瑞華二大將之效力、果能戰勝法商會、西聯甲組戰績表上、爭得勝數一次、加添二分、優游半年以還、每役不利、惟二次和局、免嘗鴨蛋、今而後海内英豪、望風來附者、必日見其多、將來之優游、遲早可爲昔年雄風四披之三育、是則全賴主持者之如何努力耳、</p>
<p>（名不虚傳）孫之威名、婦孺皆知、出戰有期、滬上球迷、不約而集者五六千、爲近年來優游出戰時未有之盛况、孫錦順乃著名鐵腿、其射擊峻急具神力、自李惠堂離滬之後、吾人久未見此驚奇之身手、東華李義臣間亦有有之、但其舉動猶欠迅速、昨日優游勝來三球、第一球名爲敵人敬客、實則孫惠培努力所造成、第二球、日光人影中、孫之鐵腿起處、但聞砰然一聲、球已入網、驚倒守門、笑壞看客矣、末後一球、單身闖入空城、平地一聲、敵門告陷、優游勝局、從此穩定、功勞簿上、列名第一、</p>
<p>（生氣勃然）十餘年戎馬生活之黃瑞華、今番重與吾人相見於球塲、受人歡迎、可想而知、傳遞迎送之合度、依然驚人、攔殺刼奪之工夫、不無減色、聞諸傳說、黃邇來疏於行軍、技能未臻純熟、稍俟時日、必能恢復故我、此外九人成績、亦較往日不同、右翼忱柏貴得孫之提携、大有貢獻、葉普綿之前衛、錢耀彬之内衛、極盡防守能事、奚七生漸有進境、全局形勢、上半時頗多奇峯突出之舉、下半時倍受敵方壓迫之苦、勝雖勝矣、不無心驚肉跳、</p>
<p>（功虧一簣）法商會抱必勝之念而來、乃逢孫黃二將、一内一外、竟使其束手無策、屈居下風、迨至後局、全軍奮進、乘風猛撲、占得優勢之優游、唯有退守疆土、力保江山、對方馬賽兒才能超衆、一夫當關、萬人莫近、守門麥納蒂左翼福高托右内法凡却皆具驚人技術、因是隨時有恢復之望、爲山九仭、功虧一簣、射擊之技欠工之故耳、</p>
<p>（敵方倒戈）三時未到、球迷滿座、引頸張目、靜待鐵頭鐵腿、未幾一陣掌聲、兩路人馬、先後入塲、優游在南、背佈陣、法隊開球、才一活動、黃瑞華卽從中路殺出、就近派與老伙計孫錦順、雷米迪阻攔不得、馬賽兒那敢怠慢、立刻刼求輸送前方、葉晋綿當先一馬、不待來球落地、迎之以頭、爲孫惠培所得、西陲放馬、直盤至低線、盡力所能、一脚傳中、馬賽兒見事不諧、趕緊阻攔鐵腿、不料球從門前橫過、前衛葛納利心慌意亂、球從其大腿　、倒彈入網、</p>
<p>（守門逞能）優游旣得一球、前鋒益見順利、沈柏貴猾如脫免、得石金生一脚遠傳、乃復單槍匹馬、深入腹地、孫鐵腿趕到、沈乃低傳中央、鐵腿猛力射門、麥納蒂揮拳擊出、又爲黃氏踏定、重行帶球闖入敵陣、至相當地點、對門射去、準而且急、麥納蒂躍起、托成角球、始行脫險、</p>
<p>（鐵腿傑作）法商得以苟延殘喘、乃</p>
<p>復引兵入寇、黃瑞華雙拳不敵四手、致敵人深入腹地、幸錢王二將、救駕有功、梁官濓官從容應付、優游之門、於此始能保持平安、少頃、孫氏又在西陲起義、胡有成在傍暗助、鐵腿邁開大步、氣呑河岳、打進重開、奚巧生得球進盤數武、轉身一勾、孫氏舉起鐵腿、砰的一聲、敵門又破、四座掌聲乃如雷動、孫得意之作也、</p>
<p>（兵犯疆土）兵再數十合、銀笛聲中、暫告休息、孫鐵腿席地授軍機、各健兒受敎晦、戰鼓一嚎、戰馬又躍、法商隊抱必勝之志而來、上半時竟享受鴨蛋一雙、不禁怒氣衝天、麥賽兒尤圓怪眼、很態逼人、指揮士卒、大舉反攻、法凡却鮑許脫兩騎左衝右突、三度射門、梁官濓鎭靜從事、尚無舛差、無何、柯來脫在罰球區内、越位、球乃從容出險、</p>
<p>（龍門失守）雷米迪奇兵突起、喊殺連天、柯來脫馬不停蹄、黃瑞華一身是膽、刼球得法、轉送前方、柏貴西陲昇火、不料出師未捷、葛納利擋住去路、鮑許脫東山再起、聯絡法凡却·傑登·三路興兵、頃刻法凡却讓去庋傑登在刀光血影中打入一球、</p>
<p>（飛騎拔城）比數旣成二對一、法商貪心不足、猶思城下言和、内防不留一卒、掃數出動、圍攻優游之門、不下十餘次、錢王二將、分頭迎戰、黃中堅遇缺即補、心細於髮、二十五分鐘之驚濤駭浪、轉眼成空、無已、黃瑞華高挑華車、孫錦順疾如奔馬、敵人兩後衛氣喘如牛、窮追不及、麥納蒂張目待刑、一刹那間、球又入法商之門、四座球迷、旣贊且嘆、從此優游有恃無恐、勝利在握矣、結果、三對一優游勝、</p>

<p>中高塔杯複賽重賽阿迦爾勝西捕</p>
<h3>二比一獲决賽權</h3>
<p>阿迦爾西捕之史高塔杯複賽、第一次各一和局、昨日於跑馬廳重賽、結果阿迦爾以二比一勝西捕獲决賽權、</p>
<p>▲上半時西捕進一隻▲　雙方爭鬥甚烈、攻守皆甚留意、上半時之形勢、平均無甚上下、兩守門救也險救不少、直至上半時將畢之八分鐘、衛根生在離敵門二十碼送一高球、阿迦爾左前衛陶却斗、跳起欲頂、未中而球向後去、傑克跑上一脚、不破之門遂破、上半時西捕一比零居先、</p>
<p>▲下半時阿迦爾連中▲　　下半時阿迦爾傾師反攻、竭全力進取、西捕向日向風、出球甚近、阿迦爾五鋒、圍打球門、至二十分鐘時中鋒傳左、爲左翼休士攻入、成和局、阿迦爾又退後、以守再十分鐘、得機又進、休士傳中、克拉格反脚一勾、適中網内、阿迦爾二比一反勝、其後西捕强逼成角球數次、皆歸無效、下半時全是阿迦爾之天下、</p>

<h3>金融半日金市全隨大户進出爲轉移</h3>
<p>＝多空實力均等＝</p>
<p>＝續好二兩四錢＝</p>
<p>（拾要）金市自前日回漲後、隔夜人心看好、昨電海外銀市果見回落、計倫敦大條縮一八七五、英美匯閱未更、美英則降四○六二五、美銀小三七五、遠期銀價亦跌四釐餘、銀行私電縮半分、匯市開盤略緊、金價開出卽漲爲八百十一兩半、稍形盤旋、卽往上漲、蓋恒興托他號代爲補空也、然因投機家吳某羅某努力脫售、故雖升至十三兩、卽行下游、匯市亦因之趨鬆、源茂永（代羅某）慶發永（代吳某）迭次售出世數、遂跌至○六兩二錢、無何中央又來開現、恒興自已上塲猛進一千六百餘條、重又回漲、此時賣興已退、升至十二兩、人心不佳、蓋因八日美銀無市、不能得知其升降、獲利者脫手、又形下降、但恒興等在十兩關口肆意傾進、將價拉住、遂以十兩○一錢收盤、綜計半日間無特殊變化、大户之進出、成爲市價之上落、廣帮約進四千餘條、吳某脫售約一千餘條、而羅某則出籠、約有二千以上、今將半日間市况誌后、</p>
<p>（素描）開盤爲八百十一兩五錢、較前收卽跳起三兩八錢、大德成及物品來進、（物品開十一兩八錢）卽漲至二兩八錢、慶發永義豐永來售、盤根售出二月份美金六二五、遂跌至○三錢、志豐永恒餘卽上塲猛進、漲爲三兩、然匯市仍鬆、源茂永兆豐昌脫手、沙遜出二月美金六八七五、見鬆至○六二五、跌至二兩内、但物品續進（此時恒興在物品托人猛購）乃至三兩、福餘大興永來出、又見下落至一兩内、恒餘慶續納條、升至二兩外、此後賣方活躍、掛牌雖小、但内盤却硬、沙遜又出正月美匯六八七五、福餘義豐永趁　售出、遂打破十兩關口、退至○八兩半光景·大德成套轉條子、價稍拉定、但賣方依然使威、慶發永又售、沙遜以賤價　美金二月份、祇做八一二五、降爲○六兩二錢、中央銀行卽於此後數次開現、人心稍穩、恒興來進、升至七兩外、但源茂永適在此際　售、價遂在恒興及源茂永之中抬壓、及至源茂永賣氣稍殺、恒興遂猛力購條、益豐、元新永亦進、遂透出十兩關个、中央續吸現標、各現貨號來進、匯市亦略好八七五、三月美金銀行二月二五亦要、重至十二兩、大興永及物品恒餘屢來脫售、而恒興則在十兩内外不時購買、價遂抬住、遂以八百十兩○一錢收盤、人心看下、物品拍小一錢、爲十兩收盤、查半日間最大八百十三兩、最低○六兩二錢、有六兩八錢升降、結果則較前收續漲二兩四錢、</p>
<p>（開現）中央銀行初時觀望、及金價跌至○六兩二錢後、始下手開現、大致均在十兩内所做約有五六百條、由恒興大德成同豐恒泰康潤等代進、</p>
<p>（揭價）美匯掛小三七五、計二十七元二五、以二四○○○合標金價八百八十兩○七錢三分、照收盤言約撳七十兩餘、較前收多撳九兩强、止二月登賬價八百十兩、補水八百○八兩、</p>
<p>（交易）計大興永源茂永兆豐昌慶發永福餘天豐永福昌等均出、恒興志豐永益豐恒餘鴻興同豐永等均進、大德成宏利義豐永等時出時進、大賣户大興永慶發永均出一千以上、源茂永則有二千餘、進者恒興自進一千數百條、托他號代進有二三千條、志豐永恒餘約有一千餘條、（大致代廣帮）益豐二三百條、察多空兩方力量、大致相等、故以中價收盤、（十三兩及○六兩二錢）物品　　則先進後出、</p>
<p>（烚赤）烚赤續昂、計照加八兩五錢、塲　者極少而進者亦不多、大勢趨好、因昨市八兩五錢之後、卽不見賣户矣、</p>
<p>（掉期）此次掉期已近、各號多空越軋越少、現货號則因中央大有納意、不願貼出、昨日祇由盈豐恒與恒興掉過正月二月一日○五條、由盈豐恒貼出一錢、蓋此際中央未曾開現也、</p>
<p>（迴顧）查本週中市况變幻甚烈、惟値獻歲、金交僅計三日業、於五日開市、以銀價迭漲、多方傾售、風波險惡、尤以北方形勢吃緊、卒已打破八百兩大關、最小爲七百九十四兩半、復後盤高十餘兩、週六爲八百十三兩、統有十八兩五錢差度、比較歲尾回落十六兩一錢、</p>
<h3>外匯緊後即鬆</h3>
<p>＝沙遜猛抛金業亦塞＝</p>
<p>＝掛牌各價一致改貴＝</p>
<p>匯市因大條銀價俱縮、初開卽緊、計近期英匯一先令七便士七五、較前收緊一二五、美匯念七元五六二五、較前收軟一八七五、入後卽鬆、蓋因漲沙遜洋行猛售、金業亦塞、交易不多、最後隨金價趨平、掛牌英縮二五、美降三七五、然此時金市正降、而内盤亦硬、結果英匯較前收約平、美匯則帶緊零六二五光景、半日間市况平庸、有一二五及一八七五迴顧、</p>
<p>（英匯）開盤近期出價一先令七便士七五、匯豐售出二月份八七五、三井所吃、三井又進三月份九三七五、大英出三月份九三七五、三井續吸、此後卽少成交、延至收盤、正月出價一先令七便士八七五、二月份略同、三月份九三七五、四月份一先令八便士、進價自九三七五至八便士零六二五、</p>
<p>（美匯）開盤正月份出價念七元五六二五、盤根首售二月份六二五、沙遜出住友吃二月六八七五、麥加利進四月份八七五、花旗進同月同價、華比出正月六二五、沙遜售上海進二月八一二五、安達進四月份八元、又吃同月九三七五、又進二月八二五、中孚售予美豐正月七五、中孚再出二月七五、乃華比所吸、華比出東方進四月份八七五、花旗正金對做正月六八七五、收盤出價正月念七元六八七五、二月七五、三月八一二五、四月八七五、進價自七五至九三七五、美金一圓、合銀三兩六錢六分九厘七毫二、</p>
<h3>倫敦大條電告不動</h3>
<p>國民社七日倫敦電、大條未有變動、收盤近期十六便士六八七五、遠期十六便士七五、又英美匯價開三元三角四分一二五、</p>
<h3>週末銀洋市例淡</h3>
<p>新年中金融界業務、例無發展可言、滬埠習慣、以廢暦結束者比比皆是、銀洋兩種業務、一時無擴誜可能、外灘銀行、更以新年、例少重大交易、華銀行方面、收解上亦不緊張、錢莊疏理結束手續、雖不覺寂寞、究以頭襯充裕、銀根過剩、實足爲市面之本患遑論業務上之進行、惟昨日收解情形、沿稱不弱、雖値週末、亦不覺少、厘拆市大都下游耳、</p>
<p>（洋厘逐步下跌銀拆平疲如故）「洋厘」昨晨大心疲軟、價格開盤時遽告低落、收盤價較前日午市猶小一厘爲七錢一分三厘半、午市稍稍平靜、較早市㣲昂一毫二忽半、爲七錢一分三厘六毫二忽半、依大勢推測、此項市面可以敷衍廢暦年關、「銀拆」早午兩市依舊仍爲二分、劃頭加水初爲二三分、旋仍白劃、銀根形勢之鬆滯、殆難名狀、</p>
<p>（江廣早跌午漲銅元繼續縮短）不南小洋早市似跌、較前日小五厘、計爲六錢三分、而午市則又上挺、計漲二厘、爲六錢三分二厘、做出交易早市五千角、午市三千五百角、廣東小洋亦以早跌午漲、早市爲六錢一分七厘半、午市爲六錢一分八厘半、結果較前日午市似好半厘、产易早市六萬五千角、午市三萬角、銅元又復回縮一千文、爲三百九十一千文、交易亦少、僅三萬七千餘串文、</p>
<p>（洋交兩市俱懈銀收解零星多）「洋欵」昨晨匯劃票欵、早市做出僅四十七萬五千、午市更少、僅四十一萬五千、鈔票早市三萬五千、午市四萬五千、塲外鈔票早市六萬、午市七萬五千、銀行支　早市十二萬五千、午市二萬五千、銀行買賣早市互市四十萬、午市互市三十五萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百七八十萬、鈔票收回及發出一百七十餘萬、客路去胃無聞、錢莊洋公單收解九百十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百二十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出二百四十餘萬、小錢莊交易八十餘萬、洋押欵取　三十餘萬、「銀欵」昨銀行收解、雖値星期六（厥數較寡）、而零星收解依然瑣繁、計外商收解票欵一百七十餘萬、華商收解票欵一百九十餘萬、墊欵二百三四十萬、結欵三百餘萬、特欵三百三十餘萬、各種貨匯稅雜諸欵收解外商二百八九十萬、華商四百三四十萬、押欵交易七八十萬、外商出倉六十萬、華商進倉四十萬、錢莊銀公單收解二千六百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百八十餘萬、各路匯欵收解五十餘萬、收現二三十萬、</p>
<h3>存息開出二兩</h3>
<p>前日錢業公會常會議决、十二月份存息標準、仍照規定之最低盤二兩九五扣計算、按二月銀拆統計、不及一兩、爲市面上最小之統計額、故議决照規定之低盤爲率、至於欠息、則照四兩半底盤遞加、如是最高欠息仍不過十兩零五錢而已、</p>
<h3>證劵債價跌勢仍勁</h3>
<p>昨（七日）華商證劵交易所各債成交情形、現市極清、祇開鹽稅一九關兩種、期市尚　活動、重要各債進出不寂、市塲人心虚弱如故、初開出時卽一致續跌、以後雖未有重大變化、然趨勢始終甚疲、無稍轉機、結果一五關本下月期及一九善一月期各跌二元餘、其他亦跌一元半左右、獨關稅編遣僅小六七角、形勢仍難樂觀、然局勢不再有變化、暫時或有反動也、計期貨交易上午四百五十餘萬、後市五百二十萬、合計九百八十一萬五千元、又現貨交易共祗二千元、</p>
<h3>紗花標紗花受時局重壓</h3>
<p>（紗）市平疲、趨勢略軟、因東北軍事依然嚴重、致人心驚惶、買者較少、一部份心理、以國外紗價高昂、原棉堅硬、拉進心意仍濃、實銷南埠採辦仍旺、</p>

<h3>美棉重心仍在農村救濟案</h3>
<p>紐約一月六日電告一週棉市云、本週原棉價格、因同業購入與缺方補進而稍回、但南方售出亦隨之而旺、本週中期之漲風、隨華盛頓或須通過通貨膨脹計畫說之復活以俱來、但此事迄未有切實進展、農村救濟案爲許多人注意之集中點、但在此間棉市上、未有任何顯著影響、蓋以此案縱可爲衆院所通過、然亦必在參院遭遇更大之反對也、惟此案苟無最後之處置、將令人歧路徬篁莫知適從、旣使人心不定、且使關於米來棉田畝數之意見、不能結品化、據美國棉產通信社云、初步調查所得之資料、表示植棉意　無甚變化、同時肥料施用之减少、果　虫活動之景象、及棉農興致之頽喪、皆足使人預料在平均氣候之下、每畝產量或將低减也、附週末統計列左、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食薄稻包子銷路仍健</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日南市到船五六十號、城鄕店胃仍健、包棧客銷續起、計售開通晚稻船頭二十餘艘、約米二千石左右、是以晚稻價格繼漲半元、蘇同帮粳尖因到銷兩平、形勢尚好、陰變元去胃轉活、價亦隨高一二尺、</p>
<p>（閘北）昨日河下到船四十餘號、店銷高貨交平、中次繼化、囤户捒中段貨續進、市面高貨站定、中次好起角許、　稻到貨不旺、天津包胃仍健、零銷亦量、故價帶緊、早稻挺秀、杜洋秈到銷兩平、市形定局、埠尖亦見定勢、陰元到少銷活、價見挺秀、白元市無榮辱、</p>
<p>湖南秈元續到一批</p>
<h3>洋米生仁申存卅三萬包二十萬包</h3>
<p>昨日客秈續由湘省裝到一批、内中機油靖等一千七百包、機元五百多包、行家多在望好中、因邇日閩化不暢、仍不敢出樣、藉資守待機會、閩帮罝口本濃、邇因有河下米去化、對於客秈鎖化轉呆、客元米質較佳、仍有應酬、惟目下存到兩多、貨主多主急脫、故元米續軟、昨日泉州帮辦去前日新到之湘機元一百三十包、價九元四角、爲長粒高貨、洋米申存尚有三十三萬包、多在英商安利祥茂等手中、市上浮存甚少、本街頗有需要、以貨主扳住不放、致未做開云、</p>
<p>黃荳去胃不湧、共成交千餘包、市形一時難定、芝蔴甬厦二帮亦去二百四十餘包、市暫看平、菉荳尚穩、生仁滬存聞有二十萬擔、走銷呆滯、市恐見疲、油市立定之勢、</p>
<h3>本月粉狂漲三分</h3>
<p>△洋麥驟漲及天津缺粉之故△</p>
<p>昨粉市上午一致堅俏、洋麥　好五六角左右、兼以天津現粉缺乏、急裝購辦、兵船現貨已批購一空、目下改批二月份廠盤二兩、開盤卽見騰貴、津帮仍然接續大吸近期、遠期以洋麥步提、同　帶振、迫至下午開盤、依然良好、市塲人心一致望高、現洋麥定價、亦較年則爲昂、二號坎麥、則喊至四兩、雖無成交、人心爲之震驚、結果本月份較前又狂漲三分、二三月份漲二分半、四月份漲四分二釐半、五月份漲三分七釐半、六月份漲三分半云、</p>
<h3>期麥飛跳八九分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、一致呈　漲之象、本月份因現貨甚少、祇有買進、一無賣也、故市塲祇有買户放價、有實貨者、均不放套出、因此步抬步高、漲度異常迅速、遠期因洋麥定價提高、年前定過之澳麥、祇三兩五錢五六分、近須三兩七錢外、坎麥則高漲更速、二號提至四兩、所以人心亦見激昂、交易雖少、漲度亦奇昂、觀此情形、完全受戰事影響所籠罩、後步如何、殊難揣測也、結果本月份漲八分、二月份漲五分、三月份漲七分、四月份漲九分、餘　比較、現　　三百包、由廠家辦去、市極硬化、</p>
<h3>糖市潮靑號盤穩定</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以今値星期日無裝出、逸出甚　市價少　動、公會划盤二四粗砂白划十五兩九錢半、稍有成交、二十號中砂白十五兩四、十八號十五兩二、荷赤八號十二兩三四錢、九號十二兩半、十號十二兩六錢半、潮靑昨續開四百包左右、上莊八兩八、次照减、號存已屬不多、後貨成本難划、趨勢可期轉穩矣、</p>
<h3>志率貨俏多疲少之南北貨</h3>
<p>南北貨在休刋期内無甚變動、惟金針菜價已廉宜號貨扳緊、而行存漸縮、進意較濃、木耳普通貨亦已升至五十二三兩、龍口粉因多到步嚮、近以銷旺略回、湘蓮因貨底單薄地價步升、行存堅守、高貨已到五十八兩、有迫近六十兩之勢、次至五十三兩不一、槐米軋缺、高貨升至五兩六七錢、黑反子亦見起色、桂圓號盤平定、行盤㣲緊、金山枝號貨堅　、不肯賤卸、蘭竹枝平疲乏銷、</p>
<p>絲茶廠經綢銷尚不寂寞</p>
<h3>丨山東大二挽手五百餘件運英丨</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無起色、緣歐美市塲自　歲以來、絲銷均無新發展、滬埠各歐莊餘稍有補空交易外、實銷依然觀　、惟内地綢門用户黃白廠經　有進胃、交易尚不寂莫、</p>
<p>山東大二挽手、自去春發現英國新銷路以來、月有數百件裝往英倫、此次大英郵船蘇屯號出口、祥茂等又有魯挽手五百七十件裝往英倫云、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶交易續旺</h3>
<p>昨來路莊之珍眉綠茶、英莊怡和錦隆等行繼續大辦、全市成交欠達三千餘箱、按現下茶價巴呹至極點、摩洛哥市塲春銷又復活動、日來國外需求電報仍湧　、市需頗有繼續發展望、貢熙俄銷亦巴　動、惟定價較前尤廉、</p>
<h3>五金海外馬口鐵又見漲風</h3>
<p>倫敦電、昨日馬口鐵九十磅要十六先令六便士、一百磅十七先令二便、比前均漲三便士、交易甚少、會司鐵現期無貨、須至四五月有貨、價每噸十四鎊半、聞本埠同業做進二三十噸　紐約電、銻漲一二五、每磅五·五○、</p>
<h3>茶帮進靑鉛千餘條</h3>
<p>自榆關發生戰事以來、北路客帮對於五金買賣大减、長江路及南路生意亦十分蕭條、本街建築帮及廠家生意亦寡、是以市情頗清、惟茶棧帮對於靑鉛買賣　盛、共計辦去有一千三四百條之多、（内一半爲二月份交貨、）行情一時提高不少、現市又開至十二兩七錢半、比前進步三四錢之多、但近日匯兌又見昂貴、恐標準尚要再漲、至於湖南鉛到貨多而銷中㣲、市面依然平常、計估十二兩之　云、</p>
<p>中俄復交後海參崴帮大辦五金品</p>
<h3>丨平津來電停辦丨</h3>
<p>五金交易自開關以　、尚無鉅大生意、惟中俄復交、海參崴帮大辦金屬品、共有數千擔之鉅其間馬口鐵開出七百餘箱、行情被其帶大、故已開至十二兩、新鉛絲·平白鐵、黑鐵皮亦各有數百擔買賣、行情新鉛絲平白鐵均帶起二錢半、黑鐵皮倘無大也入、此外白鐵管·三角鐵·新洋元等亦有點綴、惟數不多耳、平·津·諸帮因日兵犯境、來電停辦、至於長江烟台閩粤諸帮亦無鉅大交易、到貨近週以來除其昌新太古公和祥諸棧稍有裝到新鐵品外、其代他則無到貨消息云、</p>

<h3>不安靜的三夜</h3>
<p>— 李雲</p>
<p>接連三晚沒有好睡了，這是受的貼鄰一家的賜啊。第一晚，在九點過後，他們打牌了，除了那家的夫婦倆外，還有兩個男子聲音，大概是他們的朋友吧。牌碰在桌子上，聲音眞清脆呀！原來在那桌子上，連極薄的薄布，也不曾鋪上一塊呢。牌聲外，不時還加上了一陣喧聲。眞的，打牌是能練出精神的，他們多有勁呀，牌着在桌上的聲音，越來越響亮了：劈劈拍拍，不差，這眞呌做打牌了，他們中間，似乎有兩人，在用胃地打呢。有人和出了一副大牌，那末睡在隔壁的人，更是活該倒霉了，那一陣喧鬧聲，即使你在酣睡中，也不怕你不驚醒。這樣一直到兩點鐘了，還聽見有人在悻悻然喊：「再來四圈···」</p>
<p>第二晚，夜深了，有一陣門鈴聲那家的丈夫回來了。不多一會，他妻子便開始同他爭吵起來，聲音是憤怒而模糊，可聽見的只是「·····不要臉的婊子，那只　污······」和那丈夫的老羞成怒的惡狠的聲音「你才是婊子呢，你來管我什麽？哼······」接着，　𠻴一聲，不知是誰　了一只茶杯！不，也許是一只飯碗，誰知道。什麽笨重的東西又翻倒了，他們倆似乎在扭打；隨着像有人跑來勸開了。但以後又是咒駡和哭泣，一陣高，一陣低，不知道繼續到什麽時候</p>
<p>第三晚，那夫妻倆似乎都不在家，那在什麽大學裏讀書的兒子，恰從學校裏回來了。大槪他在等候着他爸媽吧，他開了唱機。什麽丨一張什麽名片吧。呀，他在跟着唱了，女性的嗓音呢，眞唱得人毛髮悚然。從别一間房裏，又發出了風琴的聲音，那是他的小妹妹，也激動了唱歌的天才了，拉着喉嚨唱了一只過了時的「可憐的秋香」他們各人自得其樂地唱着，不和諧的合奏·眞熱鬧！驚破了鄰人的好夢，這算得什麽！</p>
<p>這連續的三夜呀，不知給了我多少的不安和煩燥。</p>
<h3>緊抓住現在！</h3>
<p>— 玄</p>
<p>全世界經濟恐慌，銀行倒閉，證券跌價，工廠停歇，失業者數千萬！全世界的帝國主義者拚命備戰，兵工廠日夜開工，殺人的利器堆積如山，新發明的毒瓦斯奚止千百！全世界的「學者」再也包不住那火燒穿的謊，苦悶地呌著：文明破產！</p>
<p>呵，呵，我們這世界正到了一個人類歷史上空前的轉變時代！</p>
<p>全中國經濟破壞，毒血似的洋貨深入了農村的血管，號稱豐年，農民沒有飯喫！全中國農村騷亂，金錢向安全地帶跑，造成了者市經濟的畸形的發展，造成了都市的奢侈繁華，淫逸罪惡，朱唇，玉腿，星眼，輪盤賭，烈酒，鴉片！全中國在帝國主義的鐵蹄下，在漢㚥國賊的欺騙下，呻吟掙扎！全中國的「正人君子」搖頭長嘆：人心不古，世道維艱·</p>
<p>呵，呵，我們這中國也正到了歷史上空前的苦難時代丨丨然而也是轉變的時代·</p>
<p>黑暗混亂的現代呵丨脆弱的小市民的靈魂承受不住這苦難的「現在！」他們要逃避現實，他們仰臉看天，丨丨上帝或神所托的天，他們寄星星的慰安於涉茫的未來！他們回頭去看，丨丨神武光榮的過去，他們借此聊以自騙！</p>
<p>未來，未來！這表現也在時輪金剛法會，也在「長期抵抗」的十年二十年臥薪嘗膽！</p>
<p>過去，過去！這表現也在「民族英雄」岳武穆的景仰，戚繼光的崇拜，某處有殺倭衛，某處有禦倭臺！······我們的少引文豪顛倒數著這些「家珍，」三日三夜數不完！</p>
<p>然而「現在」怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>回答是沉默，沉默，第三個沉默！</p>
<p>可是人家却緊抓住了這「現在」𥞊馬厲兵，侵略第三個侵略！</p>
<p>咄！生當這全世界轉變時代全中國苦難時代的我們呀！再不要迷纞過去！空想未來！過去的已經過去了，未來的祇是未來！讓我們高呼一聲：丨丨</p>
<p>緊抓住現在！</p>
<h3>沈從文論結婚</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>沈從文之小說，咸謂筆緻老練，語句幽默殊不知此君書信，雅多諧謔，頗足令人發笑。猶憶十九年盛夏，彼値逭暑吳淞，曾遺函於予，論及結婚有云：</p>
<p>「我因爲自已是個老人了，所以見年靑人有太太，卽或還無資格成婚，也勸這人冒險。（還有笑話是我還做過三次媒人）。所以我勸你物别努力寫文章，也勸你冒點險去結婚。事業比起女人來事業是又算不了什麽東西了。人是只有年靑才可佩服，其他全是空的。不過自已年靑，却成天在自得自足中過日子，不知道好好的去生活，那年靑的人又好像是不足道了。愛女人，愛朋友，愛生活，好好的去做罷，年紀大了一點，一切都完了。女人是只有年輕才事價的，讓年輕女人在空氣裏老去，這是男人的罪過。」</p>
<p>去看。子輿羅洪結婚於滬，從文適在靑島，未及蒞止。吉日，得從文函，携以示洪，　相誦讀；爲述前信，相對嫣然。蓋彼曾慫恿結婚，頃見子之喜柬也。函謂：</p>
<p>「賀喜你，新婿以後日子過得很好。你那喜柬若發去一份就預備了一分喜酒，我倒很希望我的那一份你爲留下，等到我六月來上海看你的新家時再吃·辦喜事的一天一定十分熱鬧，中异得很，不能看看做新郎的神氣。上兩年趙景深做新郎時，倒很有趣味人胖胖的穿上從什麽舖子裏租來的禮服，爲了臨時找尋一顆扣子或一根皮帶，許多人亂亂的各處走去，新郎只是向褲帶邊一個口袋掏手巾，擦臉上的汗水，又儘只把頭昂起扭到一邊去，似乎很爲那一條硬領子折磨到下巴。過一會兒，外面放起炮來了，打鏢了，吹洋號打洋鼓了，可不知誰還逼到他去在大堂上像做詩一樣讚美太太兩句話，他也居然還記得從他荷花葉子上尋出幾句很　的話，且引了周作人幾句話，到後，自然就輪到一面葵樂一面吃酒那一件事了。看了這麽一回，到如今還覺得比他的小說生勤有趣味。從那個故事想到你們結婚，也一定是很使人快樂的。</p>
<p>將來預備住到上海還是仍然到蘇去？若果兩個人不缺少那種方便，在這樣滿地是花的春天，到北京去一次，倒不是一個無意思的旅行。人家都說在靑島過蜜月，丈夫可以更温柔一點，太太也可以更快樂一點：你們是那麽年靑幸福的人，若來靑島恐怕會受天所妬嫉，成天給你一次雨，一堆霧，一陣風。靑島這地方，就正像是知道春天有許多年靑人結婚，都不忘記靑島去各處很近，地方又靜，一定有人要預備來玩玩的，所以長年氣　都極好，就只這個春天，一大堆日子，都差不多楫壞極　。這里夏天是可以來玩玩的，海同天不　形容的各種顏色，使人十分和平。</p>
<p>希望你替我爲你那位太太請安。天保佑你們，此後儘是兩張笑臉過日子。」</p>

<h3>時代与愛的歧路　三十四</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>這是卓媽剛坐下來劈頭的一句話。她那種微笑，似乎帶點老奸巨猾的神氣。海泉直覺着這位老太婆是個不容易接近的。說一點是，理智過於發達了，不甚通人情的女性。</p>
<p>他們說了一會，海泉才知道卓淑華的哥哥順興，原在○○局裏當一名辦事員，最近給新任的局肯撤了職。但是他捨不得這個職業，爲這件事，東打聽，西打聽，到後來知道了。這位新局長是任錦華的老同學，任錦華所輩薦的幾個人都由新局長安揷了。前星期他才聽見他的妹妹談及同學林海泉就是任錦華的小舅，於是他便托妹妹爲他進行這一條路子。　　『只是三十元錢的小差事，我想有任先生的一封給新局長，一定可以復職。』</p>
<p>卓順興態度很懇摯地在解說。</p>
<p>『林先生可不可以帮個忙』</p>
<p>卓淑華紅着臉·向海泉送了一陣的媚笑。</p>
<p>『我五號那晚上可以看見他。·····』</p>
<p>『那末，再好沒有了。』</p>
<p>順興笑着說，看他的樣子幾次起鼓起掌來了。海泉便想·只是三十塊錢折小差事，也鑽營得這末厲害。在今晚上人自已也和要人一樣了。於是他稍微得意起來了。</p>
<p>『那就請林先生向任先生講一個情。請他爲我哥哥寫一封信給新局長·好不好。』</p>
<p>卓淑華想硬把這件事推上海泉肩上來。『不過，······』</p>
<p>他還有點遲疑，因爲他實在沒有把握。</p>
<p>『務必喲·林先生！看阿拉的面上！·····』</p>
<p>卓淑華說着，指了指她的臉，笑了。看見她那樣憨的神氣，海泉又不忍拒絕了。　　『好的。我試替你們去說一聲看看。成功不成功，就可不管的。』</p>
<p>『只要林先生答應了，那有不在功的！』</p>
<p>卓媽又下了一追的傍邊鼓。</p>
<p>忽然聽見電話機ＣhilinＣhilin嚮了一陣。卓媽忙擺開八字脚，走過接電話，把聽筒檢下來，貼在耳朶上。海泉看見她的後影，更加臃腫的難看。</p>
<p>『好的。······知道了·那個數目·········怎麽行？······回了他吧！······好囉·好囉。······不不。好囉，好囉。就是這個話。······』</p>
<p>那個老太婆一面聽電話，一面望着海泉。她的表情，像有什麽秘怕給他聽見了難爲情般的。</p>
<p>卓媽放下了聽筒，又回到八仙桌前坐下來。</p>
<p>『那一個打來的？』</p>
<p>海泉無意識地問了問。</p>
<p>『她的，······』</p>
<p>在這一瞬間，海泉看見了淑華很敏捷地向她的母親使了一個眼色，卓媽便轉變了她的口氣</p>
<p>『一個月友那邊打來的。』</p>
<p>『不是大姊那邊打來的！』</p>

<h3>温習過去策勵將來</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>丨前年三省被佔，去年錦州陷落，念年榆關失守，未卜明年今日，又將如何？丨</p>
<p>「亡國！亡國丨」的警號在中國已流行了五十年以上，所以一般人聽到「亡國」這兩個字，已好像一種勸人做好事的口頭禪了。雖然國内的窮人，沒有飯吃的人，一天多似一天，搶飯吃的範圍丨匪區，一天擴大似一天，整個政治，社會的秩序是一天比一天的渙散而紊亂，但是一班比較有飯吃的人，住在比較安靜地方的人，尤其是這十里洋塲内的上海人，多半是存着一種得過且過的心。「亡國」嗎？也不過是說說罷了，我們小百姓那裏管得了這許多。比較明白一點國際情勢的人，則更振振有辭的高唱在國際均勢下中國其所以不亡的大道理。於是「亡國！亡國！」這個名詞在國人的心目中遂一天一天的，滅少其嚴重的意義。</p>
<p>霹靂一聲，前年九一八遼寗瀋陽城被日軍佔領，三省要城繼續被佔，接連着去年一月二日的錦州陷落，全國震動了。但是在這驚浪駭濤的當中，除了東三省的同胞立感亡國的大禍降臨外，大多數人仍是覺得國際聯盟，列强政府照理是不會坐視的，祇要我們據理力爭，同時盡力援助義勇軍，厲行抵制日貨，自可以得到最後的勝利，更深一層的說，日本的這種舉動，重要的目的不外保護在東三省已得的權利，或者沒有久佔的野心等等推測。不料正在我們全國朝野驚慌失措，冀圖僥倖而又躊躇的時候，日軍却又接照他們早有成竹的計劃，開始要於二十四小時以内佔領上海四週的企圖，這一下可把我們嚇呆了，一切以往的預測全推翻了，認爲不會實現的「亡國」危險立刻重新在國人的心目中活躍起來。於是十九路軍的奮勇抵抗，遂博得全國的擁戴·尤期是住在這一向最覺安全的上海人們，閘北，江灣，吳淞，眞茹，南翔均直接的受到了鉅大的犠牲，遠至南京也受到砲轟的威脅，政府遷都了，全國認爲天堂的杭州，蘇州都受了日軍飛機的數次光顧，南市也在朝不保夕的危懼中過了三十餘天，最安全的租界中人也是日聞砲聲，惶惶不可終日，在那時候我們可以看出全國人民的愛國熱情，與亡國的危懼，實已達到最高的程度，人人都感覺到過去的大意，和毫無準備，尤其是集怨到政府的不爭氣，不抵抗丨黨爭，内亂，自私，貪污，以致國防空虚，御侮無從，同時人人都下了是大的决心，以爲全國的民衆與政府，應從即日起痛改前非，共同協力的做生聚敎訓的救亡工作。</p>
<p>十九路軍因後援的不繼，終至於退兵了。日軍亦因受了抵抗的敎訓，乃在與英法兩國諒解之下成立了所謂上海協定在。上海戰事停止的兩週以後（三月十四日）接事着有國聯調查團的來華，像煞有介事的訪問，調查，實地視察從上海，南京，漢口，天津，北平一直到東三省，然後又回到北平做報告書，鬧到九月五日這哄動一時的調查團又從上海宣告離華了。我們點察當時全國上下的心理，眞是猶移不定的到了極點，在上海戰事未停以前，則有種種懺悔過去舉準備將來的决心，但是一待戰事停止了，調查團到了上海，以至協定簽字，交通恢復後，大家的種種勇氣决心與危懼乃又隨這暫時的和平現狀的恢復而消滅，將一切的希望，全依賴到調查團的身上去了。民衆如此，政府亦如此。等到調查團離國後，於是大家的心理又盻望報告書的公佈，報告書公佈後，又盻望國聯能嚴厲的執行。但在這希望依賴調查團國聯的時期中，我們全國上下的情形怎樣呢？在民衆方面的即最低限度的抵貨運動與關外義軍的接濟亦不能澈底執行，積極援助，而政府方面中央則貫注全力於剿匪工作，各省内部則互相併火，於調查團離滬後廣東則有二陳之爭，繼之以山東韓劉之戰，接着更有四川的自殺，貴州的紛擾。在四川的戰事正激烈的時候，國聯開會了，一切的議决均給了我們一個「失望」，國聯不可靠的呼聲，遂又充滿了全國，而同時日軍準備侵犯熱河的消息亦時有所聞。在這時候，政府的準備如何我們是不得而知，民衆方面更是有心無力。所以雖然發覺國聯不可靠，知道日軍又有進攻熱河的企圖，但亦無可如何，大家都存了一且個過了年再說的心理。誰知日本軍人對於這過新年的習慣，却不甚注重，竟於新年元旦日開始攻擊榆關，該處駐軍，抵抗了兩日，又因後援不繼而退，於是榆關遂於三日下午二時失守。現在平津受了極大的威脅，南京且駐泊日艦八艘，全國朝野又大震了，上海戰事發生時的種懺悔，决心又發動起來，然則我們究將如何？</p>
<p>我們看過去的事實，我們整個民族性的缺點可以說是已暴露無遺我們現在補救的辦法，也可以說是救亡的唯一途徑，就是，從即日起，我們要有以下的幾種認識與决心：</p>
<p>㈠我們若沒有最大的努力與奮鬭，則我們在不久的將來，不是做日本的奴隸，就是要變成國際的順民；㈡我們在亡國之前來補救，總比亡國以後再做要容易得多；㈢我們要事先準備，等敵人到了面前，就來不及了；㈣我們各人先從自已做起，痛加懺悔，力求自新，我們不要責備别人因循苟安，應當反省自勵而求諸自已，先立個人的意志，再謀集合同志，共同奮鬭，我們相信祇要全國多數人能如此，中國就可以不亡。</p>

<h3>救濟勞資糾紛的建議</h3>
<p>— 阮國儀</p>
<p>（勞資糾紛問題）</p>
<p>幾年來勞資糾紛事件月必數起，考其原因，無非是勞方不諒解資方的困難，資方不體恤勞方的痛苦，以致造成這種不幸的現象。勞方始則提出要求，繼則以罷工爲要挾，資方始則拒納條件，繼則以解職爲壓迫，終至兩敗俱傷，各無所得。資方損失了營業的收入，勞方感受了精神的痛苦。假使任何一方面取得勝利的話，那勞資的感情也已磨滅無遺了，於是資方便加重勞方的工作，以抵償客外的開支，在勞方也斷不會因取得勝利而甘心增加他們工作的効率的。結果勞資糾紛又開始了。這樣循環式的長此下去，資方勢必不收創業，勞方發生失業的恐慌，而整個的社會也將爲之不安。所以如何救濟勞資的糾紛，實是目前很重要的問題。至於救濟的辦法，則非混合勞資精神於一體，使彼此有切膚之痛不爲功。我的建議是：</p>
<p>例如有一爿工廠，其資本爲一萬股，每股銀國幣十元，有工人一百名，每名工資二十元；我們就應當留存一千股或五百股爲工人利益股，然後將每個工人名下的工資額，扣出百出之五，於可能範圍内，資方給以同樣工資额的百分之五的補助金或名「體恤金」，按月代其儲蓄，俟滿十元國幣時，即得隨發工人利益股票一紙，該股票應與其他股票，享受同等權利。這樣·一個每月二十元工資的工人，一年之中他有兩股利益的分派，十年之後他就有二十股利益的進欵，工廠一天一天的發達，他的利益也同時一天一天的加厚。他想到他自已利益的加厚，他一定會努力增加他工作的效率，以期工廠的發達，得到大量紅利的均分。這在資方不過略施小惠，非但沒有損失，反得了意外的進展；而在勞方則感激之餘，也必因其與工廠關係的密切，而加倍努力本身的工作，來維護他的利益。若勞資兩方能永遠這樣携手奮鬥下去·則其結果不但小資本會變成大資本，就是工人也會變成小資產階級份子了。這樣，如果再有勞資糾紛發生的話，那我是决不會相信的。</p>
<p>再，如果解職的工人，他不願意此等股票的存留，或需欵應用，那資方也可預定章程，以八折或七五折收回他的股票；退職面願保留股票的，聽便。總之，只要他有一票的存在，工廠就不能取消他股東的資格的。</p>
<p>勞方安業了，資方就有創業的精神；工廠林立，失業的羣衆自然會逐漸的减少，而岌岌可危的中國工商業也或許因此還有挽救的希望吧！</p>

<h3>跑街先生的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 石生</p>
<p>（印刷職員生活）</p>
<p>『起先是「跟跑街」，只要跟着跑街先生天天跑，刻刻跑；責任就算盡到·如今是跑街先生了，不但要跑，而且要拖到生意，拖到生意不算數，還要收到錢，否則，哼！經理就同你不容氣了，』在我由「跟跑街」，我們順興印刷所的羅先生給了我這一番訓詞。初一聽，嚇得我身上發汗；這頑意兒，大有野鷄拉客的况味。但野鷄還好打着漂亮的照會去拉，引誘得年輕的先生們，心旌搖搖，說不定，跟着她跑，跑街先生呢，無論你在拖生意的時候，說得怎樣天花亂墜，什麽「價廉物美，交貨迅速」但聽的人若不呆，他定會頂着問：『那你們豈不蝕本麽？』『做牌子要緊，賺錢談不到』跑街先生千篇一律的打着這種「開塲白」，銀行，公司的庶務先生們，也儘管竪着耳朶，不關痛癢地聽，但他們的心版上，早刻下幾家印刷所結帳七扣，年節送禮，跑街先生陪着他們吃酒打牌的印象。那些跑街先生不用佔價不用跑，生意不拖自到，就是本銀行，公司的經理開起印刷的，庶務上也不過給他印幾本傳票，敷衍敷衍面子，大批的，還是送到别的印刷所去印，险非，庶務先生死了換旁人，我是個新進的跑街先生，那裏曉得此中三昧？可憐，天天費腿力，奔來奔去，費唾沬，說來說去，結果說得幾位庶務先生瞪白眼：『此地印的東西不多，不要天一來跑，要印，會打電話喊你』這變相的逐客令，使我凛然，不敢再留，倒抽了一口冷氣：『先生，再會，』退出來時，茶房也會瞪找幾眼，遠遠的駡：『討厭！』　　有一次，王經理介紹我到興國銀行拖生意，那庶務主任孫先生，是他的熟人，我去了，會到孫先生，他眞神氣，</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>高大的身材，長臉，穿着小背心，一個很粗的金戒指，套在手的二拇指上，黃燦燦地發光，</p>
<p>『請坐，請坐，彼此熟人，有交易無不照應，』</p>
<p>『總要請孫先生竭力帮忙，』</p>
<p>『自家人無須說得，請你每天早上跑一趟罷！』</p>
<p>遵照他的吩咐，早上九點，總要跑去接洽。跑了三天，他對我說：『現在帳簿樣子沒有打好，打好至少印個幾百本·』有幾回，他出去了，我只好坐在沙發上呆等·可是，我這帶着三分工人氣味的跑街先生，置身於富麗堂皇的銀行辦公室中，實在要令大人先生們側目·果然，一個着毛葛馬褂的先生來干涉了：『茶房，呌這個跑街先走，飯後再來，』</p>
<p>『是！是！』我很知趣，覺得自身渺小，本不敢同銀行裏的大人先生們並坐·所以不等茶房驅逐，就拔腿飛奔·</p>
<p>回到印刷所，飯已吃過了，自已掏出十四個銅子，下了一碗光麵·才吃過，電話響了：『石先生，孫先生請你就來·』是茶房的聲首，於是我又去了，碰到茶房，他說：　孫先生前脚去，你後脚來，再等一會吧！『我因已受過一次敎訓，不敢坐，站着等了好久，孫先生纔匆匆的回來。他的屁股剛貼着皮椅，却又抬起身子望外跑，瞥見了我，笑着點了點頭：『對不住，今天太忙了，明天來吧！』</p>
<p>總算他老人家大發慈悲，這天拿出兩本帳簿說：『照樣印兩本，急等着要·『接了印件回來，第二天早上，電話就像連珠似的在響：『怎麽啦！帳簿還不送來，再不來，不要了，·········印得</p>
<p>這樣慢，還想梆生意啊　！』</p>
<p>月底結帳，孫先生總算成全了二十塊錢的交易·發票開去收錢，他在算盤上滴答滴答地滾了兩滾：『二八一十六，付十六塊錢，』</p>
<p>『交易不多，請照付罷！』</p>
<p>『不行，價錢旣貴，紙張又薄，送貨又慢，不扣錢還成嗎？』</p>
<p>三張鈔票，一塊洋錢，不收也得要收，我終於寫了一張收據·適巧，興利印刷所也送來一張收據，孫先生趕忙收起，我已瞧見了下面一個總數『收大洋七百八十元·』</p>
<p>回去將收的帳欵，交給會計，王經理發話了：『怎麽啦！這一點數目，還打折扣，帳簿只算兩塊錢一本，請問，紙張，人工，油墨，開支，出在何處？印得又少，再打八折，簡直要蝕本關門！石先生，這種交易，少接接　·』隨手他就拿出一張　　表，『這個月，蝕了五百塊，下次請你出點力，還有幾筆帳目，也趕緊去收·』</p>
<p>隔了兩天，羅先生向我建議『興國銀行的孫先生，你總得要給他點回扣，不然，他那裏的生意，全給興利做了，』所以這次去了，我就將孫先生請到一邊，悄悄地說：『孫先生這邊，聽憑怎樣吩咐·』</p>
<p>『瞎說，瞎說，沒有這句話，石先生，你太瞧不起人了·』他正言厲色的說，彷彿在表白他的人格，是無上的清高，『實在印的東西不多，有，還不給你們印麽？』</p>
<p>『孫先生，六百本帳簿，四百只枳子，送來了，請打回單，』興利印刷所的跑街先生高聲的喊，打斷我們的談話，孫先生出就紅着臉起了，</p>
<p>我处問跑街的本領太差，但同時王經理亦只知剥削工人，以致工人的工作效率大爲减低，往往一禮拜限期的印刷品，總要十天半月，才能陸續地送出。顧客們發怒了，電話裏充滿了像債户洶洶索債時的責駡聲，但機器在白天依舊老牛似的慢慢地哼，到晚上纔狂吼起來，原因是開夜工是有夜工錢的。常常，工人排錯版子，校對先生看不出，印錯了，人家退回來，經理發話了：『跑街先生，接樣子時候，做什麽事的？』幾家庶務先生，見了我，也都冷冷的說：『出品旣不精，交貨又遲慢，跑什麽街，關門大吉、頂好，』可憐的跑街先生丨我丨在機器聲中，已判出了我未來的命運。每次回來，未進門，我總先要凝神聽一聽機器，如果轟轟的響，登時膽子壯了，高高興興地進門·假使不幸，一點聲息都沒有，我的心上，便會立刻像有一箍頭髮緊緊的勒着，膽怯怯地不敢跨入門檻一步了，</p>
<p>市而日見蕭條，順興的營業，也逐漸的冷落下來，機器靜悄悄地蹲在地上，全天的沒有響聲·工友們都打着赤膊，躱在窗子下面，偷偷地下棋子，幾位職員，搖着芭蕉扇，在帳房間裏幌來幌去·王經理，躺在沙發上喝汽水，大聲地駡：『跑街先生，二十塊一月，幹的什麽事？』這時我剛從外面飛奔回來，衣衫濕淋淋的像剛從水裏拿起，頭大的汗珠，一顆一顆的從臉上掉在地上，喘過一日氣來，預備跨進門檻，聽到駡聲，又趕快的掉轉身子，含着一眶眼涙，向着那炎炎的夏日下面，火　的柏油路上，一步一步地踏上我底生活之路！</p>
<h3>言論從商標糾紛說到實業不振</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>近來家庭化學工業社與華南化學工業社爲着商標糾紛丨丨詳情見報載丨丨雙方大登廣告，各逞雄辯。這在當今幼稚的產業界，確是個很嚴重的問題，値得提出來和大家討論的。所要聲明的是，記者與雙方都無絲毫關係，願從旁觀者的立塲上，來探討這個糾紛底下所隱伏着的病源，與提倡國貨前途的障碍，幸讀者指正。</p>
<p>這事的起因，是因華南社以胡蝶女士的肖像爲該社所出牙粉的商標，家庭工業社以爲華南社有意與該社「無敵牌」商標相混，特呈請商標局撤銷該項商標的注册。但華南社並不因此甘休，却大登　　的　　　　　，以致　　　　工有『依法辦理，决不　循情面』的聲明。後事未可知，經過是這樣。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們從雙方發表的文件，與所持的理由來加以判斷，不能不說華南社有『影射』之嫌。因爲用　音類似或同一的商標，施用於同類的物品，是法律所不許的。而「胡蝶」與「無敵」·除了語音學專家外，在尋常人口中實無分别，而且又犯了施用於同類同物品的禁例。所以在道德上與法律上，華南社不能避免相當的責任。但記者不是法官，所以對於兩方的曲直，也不想作最後的判决，而想於社會心理方面去探討這個糾紛的動機與結果。</p>
<p>我以爲「影射」「冒牌」，實與盜竊無殊，而爲國貨產業界不振的一個重大原因。尋求這種行爲的基點，又根於僥倖與懶惰的國民性。地無東西，種無黑白，人智是平等的，我們爲什麽不去創造個新的？要知道僥倖取巧，只是自視爲低能的舉動，而我們的社會，却充滿着這種氣味，賣剪刀的都是張小泉，賣醬肉的都是陸稿薦，不思獨創一格，常想襲取現成，然而盛名一濫，便不足以取信於人，這實是至愚至可憐的事。而國產業前途，在這種情形之下，那裏會有蓬勃的氣象呢？本來同業競爭，是向上的現象，但必須依正當的途徑，從本質上去爭勝，面非可以從名字上去僥倖得因爲『名者，實之實也』，實至則名歸，一般顧客，非盡呆大，雖可以名字朦混於一時，而持久則終須恃實質。我們從事實上說，在「無敵牌」牙粉沒有發明以前，日貨金剛石牙粉在我國的市塲上，年銷約五百萬元。但現在日貨已告絕跡，每年挽回利權不少。這點，我對於陳栩　先生表示無上的敬意，丨丨雖然我與陳先生是素不相識的。我以爲値得效法。</p>
<p>提倡國貨，振興實業，這確是當今的要務。因爲現在我們日常所應用的，小自一根牙簽火柴，大至衣服器用，大都是舶來品，漏巵外溢，實堪痛惜，留待產業界勞力的途徑正多，商人因在謀利，但須以民生，國家爲前提。倘掉轉槍頭，移自牙殘殺的政策，向外國同業競爭，在第三者地位的消費者，是沒有不樂子贊助的，「無敵牌」牙粉的成功，便是先例。將來大家都成爲老牌子，豈不是個個都是「無敵牌」，又何必在現在此爭彼奪，徒增笑話呢？俗語說『貨色賣銅錢』，可知道値錢决不在於一塊招牌上，我又何必示弱？若要生意發達，只須返求諸已。心存僥倖的人們，請反省一下吧！</p>
<p>歸結這篇文字的主旨，在然望從事於實業的人們，抛却僥倖取巧的心理，而從實質方面去與人爭一日之長。因爲顧客非盡可欺，生財也須有道。</p>

<h3>科學的人事管理</h3>
<p>— 耿酉</p>
<p>人事處置，在工塲管理上最占重要，亦即最難解决之問題。其實所謂人事管理，全基於勞資雙方之心理改革，開誠合作，處之以公，不埋沒其個性，順乎勞工之趨向，而與以適當之工作。人事管理，苟能達到圓滿的結果，則科學管理之初步目的，可謂已臻具體；換言之，實施科學管理之第一步，在達到人事管理之適宜，蓋勞資兩方苟不能相融洽，則又焉能望其業務之進展？</p>
<p>七塲設立之地址，常以原料供給及貨品出市便捷爲根據，故窮鄕僻野，交通不便，每不適於工廠之開設：反之，輪埠鐵路之聚合點，爲商業工塲最盛之區，四言雜居，籍貫不同，因之勞工之性情，習慣𢌞異，其欲冶於一爐，誠非�</p>
<p>易易。</p>
<p>人爲最複雜最無標準之動物，因環境，天性等等之關係，即生下述之不同點。</p>
<p>㈠生理（體質）上之不同强，弱，高，矮，肥，瘦等之不同。</p>
<p>㈡心智上之不同天賦，習慣，嗜好等之不同。</p>
<p>㈢敎養之不同所近敎育程度之不同。</p>
<p>㈣家庭關係之不同家庭之哀樂，各不相同。</p>
<p>㈤祖傳之不同遺襲有豐有嗇；流芳或遺臭於子孫。</p>
<p>㈥環境之不同出身事業及發祥　點等之不同。</p>
<p>㈦社會情形之不同風俗，人情，隨地互異。</p>
<p>人之不同，顧豈祇上述而已。工塲事務，非　一二人即能工作，其組織之大者，工人人數，動輒以萬計，不但品性不同，籍貫互異，即工作之勤惰，巧拙亦各有不同。故欲使管理有方，工人樂於工作，實爲一大可探討之問題也。</p>
<p>人爲理智動物，愈壓抑則反動愈烈，故每作一事，自動者較强迫者成績爲優。其人事管理，要不外應用上述之原則，設立人事部以處理之，其職務之槪略如下：</p>
<p>㈠職工進用或升調，須與人才與事務兩得其宜。</p>
<p>㈡分析工作之性質如何，及難易程度如何而定適當之報酬。</p>
<p>㈢工作標準之規定，以爲奬勵或訓練之繩準。</p>
<p>㈣工資等級之研究。</p>
<p>㈤勞工福利，衛生，及安全問題。</p>
<p>㈥鼓勵職工，如施行奬賞等之鼓勵辦法。</p>
<p>㈦訓練職工，使增大工作效率，並指導輔助其進取。</p>
<p>普通管理之範圍約如上述，若更進一步研究各個工人之狀况，則惟職工調查是尚，職工調查所宜注意之點如下：</p>
<p>㈠各人之敎育程度及經騐。</p>
<p>㈡各人之職務及工作成績。</p>
<p>㈢個人對事務之感想，是否有不滿意之處。</p>
<p>㈣個人之家庭狀况及經濟情形。</p>
<p>實施調查之時，宜以愈詳盡爲愈佳，蓋勞工平日，不能接近資方，一切疾苦，無由外洩，當局者正宜利用調查之時間，以解决此巨大之問題。尤不得不注意者，即對於職務是否覺有興趣，蓋從事任何工作，興趣所在，必得十二分之佳果，否則必無改進之希望！</p>
<p>更須密切注意者，即在管理員之本身。管理員苟能具大公無私之精神，循循善誘；具靈頴之頭腦，判别是非；對於各人工作之勤惰，有確切之認識，奬勵之，慰勉之，訓練之，務使多數之勞工，樂於工作，則科學的人事管理　幾近乎。</p>

<h3>海底攝影的成功史</h3>
<p>— 盛展能</p>
<p>電影要以新奇爲貴，攝影技師所慘澹考慮的便是這「新奇」二字。例如「海底二萬里」（ＴwentyＴbousandＬeagnesＵndertbeＳea）一片在攝製以前，威廉遜不知用了多少心血。</p>
<p>通常欲攝海底的景，大抵在攝影塲内貯水於玻璃槽中，在水内佈海底的景物拍攝。但這種攝影不能得海底的眞相。靑年攝影師阿湼斯特威廉遜有感於此，苦心研究，結果，理想成爲事實終於達到了直接向海底攝影的理想。</p>
<p>威廉遜的父親查理威廉遜是一個有名的海底管發明者。威廉遜和乃弟喬治協力將父親所發明的海底管加以改良使成伸縮自由的管，以大玻璃裝於管端，由母艦沉此管於海底，使它能夠自由在的在海底攝影。</p>
<p>準備完竣，威廉遜兄弟將管沉入海底，預備攝影，然因海底過暗，又將能發强光的電燈沉下。電燈沉下的結果，不特海底光亮可以攝影，而且海底魚類見着電光四面來集，更得良好的相片，於是世界最先的海底攝影竟於一九一三年六月十八日宣告成功。</p>
<p>海底攝影不是到處俱可的，要選白沙的海底爲宜，又因潮水與母船送空氣上的關係，和技師不能在海底過久的緣故，所以要攝成一部海底影片須費許多時日。威廉遜經非常的苦心和努力，終於攝成了，題爲「威廉遜氏之海底探險。」</p>
<p>萬有電影公司見這影片，大爲欣賞。以爲僅攝海底的景，興趣還不濃厚，非編成奇談使海底景物展開於觀衆的目前不能增加興趣，於是聘請威廉遜氏開始攝製「海底二萬里，」此片一出，海底的一切秘密活躍於我們的眼簾，眼界增廣了不少，並且添了無限驚奇，壯偉的感想。</p>

<p>今年的元旦，映頭輪片的·竟有九家戲院影迷們福眼眞不淺呀·現在將幾家好片子，作一總評如下：</p>
<h3>（南京）····蠻女天堂</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>在元旦公映的一切片子中，蠻女天堂ＢirdofＰaradise可以算最好。這一張片子在任何雜誌或刋物上·都很早就有了介紹·牠是一幕描寫禮敎丨迷信丨所造成的悲劇·更沉痛的談到白人和土人種族上的界限·到末尾女郎犠牲生命·反使那戀愛更顯偉得大·導演金維多一生的作品中·這也是最好的·卽使是題外的穿揷也沒一秒鐘呌觀衆會鬆懈。用天然偉麗的景緻山崩海嘯急喘之中還帶不少美感·鏡頭的地位也很巧妙·游泳幾幕·眞如畫中·德里奥ＤoionesＤelＲio的浪漫私情熱·把劇本弄得更悲慘·幽默的表情流利的土語·也許可以呌作「入神」麥史利ＪoeＭcCrea更有可驚的表演。</p>
<h3>（卡爾登）···逛巴黎</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>華納的滑稽明星亞爾生Ｏlsen和約翰生Ｊkhnson也許是大家所不知道的，逛巴黎soo,ooo,oooFrenchmen的公映·多少已抬高了他倘的身價。這片中對白很多，笑話很少，旣無歌，又不舞·所以滑稽的地方全靠無意識的小動作和「發鬆」的表演。劇情不錯，反人生看作兒戲很巧妙的形容出來。在導演方面。能力綽有餘裕。攝影光線和佈最，因是全部五彩，所以富麗十足。演員很平均，每一個人都能代表某一階級人的特殊個性·同時也暗暗的諷剌着現代社會中金錢的魔力。在趣劇中，這片子可稱上選。</p>
<h3>（新光）···銀星成功史　燕南</h3>
<p>據一般人對我的談話中，似乎銀星成功史ＷhatＰriceＨollywood是一張中等片子，但是我的見解，以爲牠應當列於優等中。牠不能受多數人歡迎的原因，大約是對白太多，然而對白是非常精彩而不能省去的。康絲登裴納ＣonstanceＢennett在這片中·比已往成續又進步了，摹倣一個初入影界的女郎，藝術上有層次的進步。唱的一段歌·非常可取海米爾頓ＮeilＨamilton也極稱職。羅惠爾ＬowellＳherman的狂放率直，使人對他有說不出的感情，他把得意和失意的情緒，一步一步的表露，如水銀瀉地無孔不入，前後表演判如兩人。牠還有的優長，就是坦白的描寫影界中人的實際生活，攝影塲的工作，比任何以好萊塢作背景的片子都忠實。</p>
<h3>（新光）····巴黎血案</h3>
<p>— 介</p>
<p>巴黎血案ＭurderintheＲueＭorgue是很著名的偵探小說，攝成了影片，也就不同凡響。牠並不是純粹的偵探片，牠有駭人的地方，那一種恐怖神秘緊張，可以說超過了科學怪人，而實際上，這片子又是合情理的。導演手腕很可誇，不但使平常觀衆會一刻不能安靜，就是讀過的來小說的人，也有「莫測」的顫動。全部的光線和攝影，側重在黑蜕和驚駭方面，大的影子，急民銳呼，有神龍見首不見尾之妙。劇情也極「一波未一波又起」之能事。盧苟西ＢelaＬugosi很能發揚他的本能，他一舉一動，都有牽動了觀衆的心理。雪妮馥絲ＳidneyＦox也有相當的佳點。如果你希望緊一緊你的心情·那末這是不可放過的片子。牠所給你的，比歌舞片或戀愛片更有回味。</p>
<p>閱者意見</p>
<h3>「到鄕村去」</h3>
<p>— 去平女</p>
<p>在廿二日的本刋，島生君發「鄕村電影院的需要一文，讀後，使我非常快感·</p>
<p>誰敢說鄕村中的人們，不歡喜娱樂·你看，當廟中做起戲的時候，那次不是擠得不堪·同時，我們也可聽到鄕人打戲子的新聞，據說因爲戲子做錯了戲·由此，可見鄕人戲文的熟，實不亞於都市·</p>
<p>電影是高尚的娱樂，也是高貴的藝術·現在，更被公認爲社會敎育的工具，在諸種娱樂中坐了首席·</p>
<p>至於它的設立，我覺得在鄕村中，建個大電影院·在最近的中國鄕村，完全是空想·所以，我們不必這樣幹·我覺得在鄕村中除田和屋外，頗有許多廣大的晒塲·我想，可利用這設立露天影戲塲·至於在冷天裏，則可利用廟和祠堂，來開映·至於設備，我想可不必過於考究，電風，水汀不須要·即使坐椅，也平平常常的便是·我想只要以低減成本爲目標·則使他們只要出幾銅元，偈可來看·那麽才可普及·這委實是電影事業的新途徑·希望同志們快些「到鄕村去！」</p>
<h3>王人美暫時帮忙</h3>
<p>— 吉仲</p>
<p>野玫瑰王人美，賴其流利之表演，生動之體態，今已儼然厠身於第一流之銀星矣。今因亨生公司鄭應時汪福慶之拉攏，已暫允加入「春潮」中表演。緣是片女主角原有兩人，一即浪漫女角，已由李麗女士擔任，而劇中卒得戀愛成功之活潑姑娘一角，迄今未曾解决，茲已有王小姐允爲帮忙矣。</p>

<h3>「火柴大王」本事（二）</h3>
<p>— 希孟譯</p>
<p>保羅的上升，並不以此爲上境。這位工頭，有一個女兒，名字呌蓓蓓。她很美麗，在保羅的眼光中看來，好似一位天上的安琪兒。不久蓓蓓亦受了保羅的蠱惑，將保羅深深地印入了她靑嫰的心靈上了。</p>
<p>有一天保羅到工頭家裏去，她盈盈的秋水，望住了保羅的臉，似乎有一段說不出來的情話，要向保羅傾吐。工頭是喝酒喝醉了，高興得樂極忘形了。他看見了保羅進來，高聲的呌喊起來。</p>
<p>『這小子聰明極了。蓓蓓，你知道你每禮拜替我存在銀行裏的錢，是誰賺來的？誰呀？哈哈，沒有誰，誰都沒有賺。我現在名單上，已有八個名字，牠們的主人翁，不知道這世界上有沒有。都是烏有子虚的弟兄們。哈哈，有八個鬼，穿了白制服，替保羅和我做工，你說有趣沒有趣。這個妙計。都是保羅想出來的。』他說完了，醉醉醺醺的，東歪西倒的到臥房裏去尋周公去了。這裏剩了保羅和蓓蓓兩個人。</p>
<p>『這個酒糟的老頭兒，』保羅開口了，　『但這亦不是長久之計。甜心呀，究竟銀行裏存了瑚</p>
<p>多少錢？』</p>
<p>『四百六十塊，』她低低的告訴他，她的桃腮緊緊地貼了他的臉。『保羅小心些。給他發現了，他一定要制我於死地，一定連你京要弄死。『</p>
<p>『寳貝，你放心。事情不到臨頭，你不用發急。我自然會想法的。『他吻了她的嘴唇，放她去了。裏面的醉老頭兒正喊着：</p>
<p>『蓓蓓。』</p>
<p>『天晚了，我要去了，』保羅告辭的說。他說完就走了。</p>
<p>保羅回到竊人巢裏的臥房裏，自言自語的盤算着那老頭兒的四百六十元連我自已所有的房門底下，一土主信塞了進來。保羅拾了起來拆開看了。那信是從保羅的叔父從瑞典寄來本。他的叔父在瑞典開了一爿小火柴廠。他信上說很對不起，他知道保羅在美國事業偉大的，年不敢以小事煩勞他，但因爲年紀大了，廠裏專務不大順手，但倘使保難能夠不忘記他寒陋的家族，肯惠然來臨，一定能給他多少好敎訓，使垂敗的事業，得以維持下去。</p>
<p>保羅怱怱地尋出報紙來，翻閱到歐洲去的船期。到了第二天，他偷偷兒地去會見蓓蓓。到了第三天，他又在銀行對面，等假蓓蓓。一會兒蓓蓓來了。她將一捲鈔票塞入保羅的手中。他可以覺得蓓蓓嚇得手都發顫。</p>
<p>『甜心呀，你爲什麽這樣胆小呢？』他說。等到我們離開了此地幾萬里，恐怕那老頭兒還沒有知道呢。但是時候不早了，你趕快回去收拾你的東西吧。』</p>
<p>『保羅！』蓓蓓驚喜得喊了出來。她抱住了的他臂『你愛我麽？你眞愛我麽？』</p>

<h3>No Change in the Shihe Position</h3>
<p>Japanese troops mobilized towards Jiukou yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese Armored Vehicle Shells Huangtugang</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Drop Three Bombs on Haiyang Town</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There has been no change in the Shihe position. From the evening of the 6th to 7:00 PM on the 7th, there was only intermittent gunfire on the front line, and the enemy did not open fire. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 4:30 PM on the 7th, a Japanese armored vehicle fired three shells from Shihe towards Huangtugang and then left. In the evening, intermittent gunfire was heard on the front line. At 2:30 PM, two Japanese aircraft flew to Haiyang Town and dropped three bombs before leaving. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu: Traffic on the Yushangguan railway station has been cut off. An armored vehicle and two troop transport cars are parked west of the station, appearing ready to advance westward. Jiukou and Shimenzhai, being key strategic passes, are being firmly defended by our troops. At noon on the 7th, three Japanese aircraft flew over and dropped more than ten bombs, causing no damage. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that the Japanese side intends to use the Boxer Protocol as an excuse to prevent our side from transporting troops on the Beining Railway, so as to achieve their dream of occupying Luandong. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Our troops are still firmly defending the area around Shihe, maintaining strict vigilance. Our soldiers have not slept for three days and nights, but their morale is very high. The enemy seems to have changed its plan, using Chinese traitors to form plainclothes teams to sneak into our positions and harass us. At 10:00 AM this morning, two Japanese aircraft flew along the coast from Qinhuangdao to Changli for reconnaissance. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army's 23rd Regiment of the Suzuki Unit in Yuguan moved to Shahe, three li outside the pass, yesterday, occupied nearby villages, and forced farmers to build defensive works. This morning, an enemy infantry and cavalry combined unit mobilized towards Jiukou, pressing our left flank. On the front, our troops are strictly guarding along the west bank of the Shihe River, ready to counterattack if the enemy advances. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese aircraft have been conducting reconnaissance and bombing runs over Haiyang Town, Fujia Village, and Majia Village for several days. Yesterday afternoon, Japanese aircraft dropped heavy bombs on Haiyang Town, fortunately causing no losses. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu: There was no contact on the front line on the 7th. Both sides are maintaining their positions. Two Japanese aircraft conducted reconnaissance over our position on the west bank of the Shihe River for more than an hour in the afternoon, but did not drop bombs. More than 400 enemy troops are actively building positions on the east bank of the Shihe River. Troops from the 8th Division are continuing to gather in Yuguan. The division headquarters has moved from Jinzhou to Tianzhai in the west street of Yucheng. Our troops have built solid fortifications on the west bank of the Shihe River. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the night of the 6th, the enemy army used three tanks to attack our Shihe position. They were repelled by our 9th Brigade using flat-trajectory artillery. At 1:00 AM this morning, the enemy resumed shelling our positions with artillery. Our army returned fire, and the shelling stopped after about an hour. Civilian houses and villages near our positions were all destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, and the residents fled. At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, three Japanese aircraft conducted reconnaissance and bombing raids on our positions, and then flew to Haiyang, Beidaihe, and Funing for reconnaissance and bombing raids, causing no significant damage or casualties. Japanese aircraft have been conducting reconnaissance on our telegraph office and brigade headquarters for several days, but have not succeeded. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There has been no formal contact on the Shihe front line for several days. The enemy is transferring puppet troops and puppet police from the rear to concentrate in Yucheng. A portion of the Japanese 8th Division has been secretly withdrawn to Yixian and other places near the Rehe border. The enemy's movements in recent days suggest that they will use puppet troops to take over the defense of the Yucheng area, so that the main force of the Japanese army can invade Rehe. The Pingyu telephone line is still connected to Qinhuangdao this morning. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Various sources deny the reports of renewed fighting in Yuguan yesterday. The Japanese commander in Tianjin, Nakamura, issued a public statement at 8:00 AM this morning, stating that everything was quiet at the Dashihe position. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) War clouds seem to be gathering again in the north. Japan views certain troop movements on the Chinese side as grounds for opposition. If the Japanese army adopts a policy of using pretexts to provoke incidents, then all of North China will soon become a battlefield. There are a relatively large number of Japanese troops between the Luan River and Shanhaiguan. According to highly reliable sources outside Yuguan, there are about 6,000 Japanese troops inside the pass, and even more Japanese troops outside the pass. The Chinese army between the Luan River and the Dashihe River is relatively small in number. Fearing a Japanese attack, they have had to move troops to the rear. According to various sources, five troop trains carrying 8,000 soldiers passed through Tianjin last night, heading east. The Chinese side believes that the military strength in the Qinhuangdao area is weak, and fears a Japanese attack. Furthermore, Nanjing has issued orders to resist if attacked, so the Chinese side has had to increase the rear forces in Qinhuangdao. At the same time, the Japanese authorities consider even the movement of a single Chinese soldier as a provocative action, which can serve as a reason for the Japanese army to continue its attacks. Therefore, the current situation is extraordinarily dangerous. Given this situation, the only way to avoid repeated bloodshed in North China seems to be for the Chinese side to completely submit to any conditions that the Japanese military authorities may propose. However, this is of course something that the Chinese side cannot do. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Conduct House-to-House Searches in Yuguan City</h3>
<p>The "Number One Pass Under Heaven" Wooden Plaque</p>
<p>Was Sent to Tokyo by the Japanese Army for Display</p>
<p>(Beiping) After occupying Yuguan County, Japanese troops conducted house-to-house searches. Anyone deemed suspicious was arrested. Korean thugs wantonly harassed residents, forcing households to hang Japanese flags. The old wooden plaque "Number One Pass Under Heaven" hanging from the Kuixing Pavilion was sent to Tokyo by the Japanese army for display. Security checks at all gates of Yuguan are extremely strict. Refugees are expelled from the west gate, escorted by Japanese plainclothes teams to near the Shahe Bridge, and then deliberately fired upon to scare the refugees for amusement. Most of the police in the city have been shot. Shops inside and outside the south gate are closed. Vehicles on the puppet Fengshan Railway are plastered with various slogans. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese appointed An Degong as the puppet police chief of Yuguan. Anyone who receives a note from An with the words "Manchukuo Police Protect This House" can avoid being searched by Japanese troops. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Shell Chinese Positions at Nanling</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Conduct Reconnaissance Over the Chaoyang Area</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Hongxiao, director of the Chengde Telegraph Bureau, reported to Peiping by telephone tonight that Japanese armored vehicles suddenly opened artillery fire on a certain company position of our 107th Brigade at Nanling on the night of the 6th. However, we responded calmly and thwarted their attempt. There has been no change in Lingnan. There has been no recent increase in Japanese troops in Suizhong. The train station is under heavy guard. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy's plan to invade Rehe has intensified in recent days. At noon on the 6th, five Japanese aircraft flew from Yixian to the Chaoyang area for reconnaissance, dropping bombs on the positions of volunteer forces along the way. It is widely rumored that the enemy will launch a general offensive on Rehe within days. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the evening of the 6th, Japanese armored vehicles from Chaoyang Temple shelled our positions at Nanlingkou, Beiyingzi, and other places. Our troops prepared to engage the enemy, and the situation was extremely tense. The situation eased only after the Japanese armored vehicles returned to Yixian. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Shuchun, director of the Rehe Construction Bureau, wired to Peiping stating that Rehe Province is generally calm. Japanese troops are only in conflict with volunteer forces in Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Lingnan, Kaiyu, and other counties. The Japanese army has transported more than 500 troops from Datong Road to the Kai Lu County area. We have already informed the front-line troops to be on high alert. Groups of three to five Japanese people have been discovered in the Lihan Dianzi area of Fuxin County, making contact with Mongolian bandits for bribery and sales. Japanese aircraft frequently conduct reconnaissance over Chaoyang County, scattering reactionary leaflets. Most of the Japanese troops are still stationed in the Chaoyang Temple area. The Japanese 6th and 8th Divisions are stationed from Lingnan Yaowang Temple to Gaozhan in Lingzhong County. The Japanese army is using Mongolian bandits and bandit troops as the front line, and they have already formed a united front, with their ambition to invade Rehe growing increasingly active.

<p>(Tianjin) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers Association have scheduled a meeting on the 8th to invite leaders of the British, American, Japanese, and other chambers of commerce to discuss forming an international joint organization of merchants and residents to find a way to prevent war from breaking out in Tianjin.

<p>(Beiping) Our troops are building strong positions along the coast of Qinhuangdao and have resolved to resist any Japanese provocations. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) British and American warships are preventing all steamships from approaching the shore at Qinhuangdao to prevent conflict. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy and our troops are about ten li apart. Shops in Qinhuangdao are gradually reopening. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Of the nine Japanese warships originally anchored at Qinhuangdao, six sailed out to sea yesterday, leaving only three remaining. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreign sources in Qinhuangdao, the situation there is still calm, but the westward movement of Chinese troops seems likely to disrupt the overall situation. It is reported that seven battalions of Chinese troops have entered the area between Tangshan and Qinhuangdao. A Japanese minelayer arrived in Qinhuangdao today, bringing the total number of Japanese warships there to five. Wounded soldiers are being continuously transported to this place. The Peiping military hospital is currently accommodating 550 people. Various organizations in Peiping are currently raising funds and purchasing goods to comfort the wounded soldiers and those still on the front lines. In addition to urging Zhang Xueliang to resist, they are also telegraphing Nanking to request that troops be sent to assist Zhang. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than 100 Japanese residents of Qinhuangdao are scheduled to go to Dalian on the 8th. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese flagship and two cruisers are docked at the Kailuan dock in Qinhuangdao. Japanese marines have not landed. The area north of the railway is under the guard of our army's Tian Detachment. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Refugees from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin say that the place is still relatively quiet, but enemy planes are sure to come for reconnaissance once or twice every day, and people are very uneasy. The wealthy and middle-class families have already traveled west one after another. All the shops in the city, except for food shops, are open as usual. The source of food has been cut off, and the prices of rice and flour have skyrocketed. Employees of the Kailuan Mining Bureau in the area are working as usual. Most of the families of the Chinese staff have left for other places. Those who want to return to the south will have a ship prepared by the Luan Bureau to sail to Shanghai and Yantai on the 8th. Senior officials who do not want to leave the country can take refuge on British warships when necessary. West of Qinhuangdao, our army's morale is very high, and the whole area presents a state of war. The British Municipal Council has secretly ordered the white volunteer army to prepare for emergencies. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Discusses Plans to Deal With the Yuguan Incident With Key Figures</h3>
<p>=The Capital's Circles Ask for a Firm Stance, Preparing to Deal With a Powerful Enemy=</p>
<p>=The Government Believes It Concerns the Entire Safety of the Country and Is Under Discussion=</p>
<h3>Chiang Bo-cheng and Gao Lingbai Arrive in Nanking to Meet With Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>(Nanking) Chiang Kai-shek entered the city from Tangshan on the morning of the 7th and rested at the official residence of the military academy. He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Luo Wen'gan, Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, and others all came to pay their respects. Chiang made detailed inquiries about the Yuguan incident and had a concrete discussion about response plans. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) People from all walks of life in the capital are extremely anxious about the fall of Yuguan and the precarious situation in North China, and there is a general sense of alarm. They plan to petition the government to take a firm stand, concentrate all its forces, and prepare to deal with a powerful enemy. It is heard that the government believes that this incident concerns the entire safety of the country, and that the main policy for dealing with it should be determined by the degree of development of the situation. Important military and diplomatic matters are currently under discussion. After Zhang Xueliang reports on the actual movements of enemy troops inside and outside the pass within the next few days, appropriate decisions will be made. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) A certain important figure told this newspaper's reporter that in the Yuguan incident, the Japanese army's extremely cruel and bizarre actions are escalating. The National Government believes that the situation is so serious that self-defense is essential for survival. The long-term resistance advocated by the National Crisis Conference should be adhered to from beginning to end. Leaders of the party, government, and military have already formed a solid alliance and are preparing to deal with this difficult situation. The so-called resistance should have a comprehensive plan and should not be limited to a corner of North China. Although Zhang Xueliang should primarily bear the responsibility for military affairs in North China, the government should not ignore them. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has now returned to Nanking and is holding important discussions with government colleagues regarding response strategies. As for diplomatic matters, our request to use the power of international public opinion to impose sanctions should not be abandoned. However, based on the impressions gained in recent years, it is felt that the Sino-Japanese dispute has fallen into a state of neither peace nor war, neither life nor death. Our side has already suffered no small losses, and we have no choice but to rise up and seek survival through self-defense. If the League of Nations does not uphold justice, not only will China suffer damage, but the truth of the world will be obscured and peace will no longer be guaranteed. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) Chiang Bo-cheng arrived in Nanking today and will go to Shanghai that night. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) Chiang Bo-cheng and Gao Lingbai arrived in Nanking from Jinan on the 7th and will pay their respects to Chiang that evening to report on important matters. It is said that Han Fuju was extremely indignant at the Japanese army's invasion of Yuguan and is willing to unite with generals across the country to resist. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Tangshan from Hangzhou on the 6th and stayed at the club. At 10:00 AM on the 7th, he rode in several cars with his entourage into the city, drove directly to the military academy's official residence, and Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, and Luo Wen'gan all came to the military academy to pay their respects, reporting on important matters and discussing the Yuguan incident. In the afternoon, he summoned Chen Shaokuan, Gu Zhenglun, and Wu Siyu. At 4:00 PM, he took a car to the mausoleum to rest. In the evening, he will summon Bao Wenwei and Chiang Bo-cheng to inquire about the details of the Japanese invasion of Yuguan and the recent situation in North China. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) Although Military Commission Chairman Chiang has arrived here, today's meetings are all of an informal nature, merely an exchange of opinions between key figures in the National Government. Participants are unwilling to express opinions on the current situation. There is currently a tendency in military circles, especially among lower-ranking officers, that the government should not show weakness in handling the Yuguan case. However, as of now, there have been no significant military actions either in this area or elsewhere. It is rumored that former Qing dynasty officials are now flocking to Tianjin, hoping that the Japanese military authorities will install Puyi in Peiping as emperor. General public opinion is that Zhang Xueliang will ultimately be unable to hold his territory. Resistance would not be dishonorable, but non-resistance would only bring humiliation. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanking) The details of today's meeting of key figures in the National Government are unknown, but according to reliable sources, the Chinese authorities do not want to escalate the situation and hope for a swift and satisfactory resolution of the Yuguan case. However, if the Japanese army attacks Chinese positions in Qinhuangdao or causes disturbances elsewhere, the Chinese army will certainly resist. Therefore, future developments depend entirely on Tokyo. At the same time, the authorities have made military preparations in North China, along the coast, and in the Yangtze River basin to deal with any possible emergency. After Chairman Chiang arrived here this morning, he met with key figures such as He Yingqin and Zhu Peide at the military academy, and the discussions lasted until noon. In the afternoon, Chiang went to Tangshan and will return to Nanking tomorrow afternoon. It is reported that the General Staff Department will hold an important meeting this afternoon to discuss the defense of the Yangtze River coast and North China. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen is Scheduled to Convene on the 16th of This Month</h3>
<p>China's Protest to Japan is Delivered to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Japan is Widely Rumored to Have Reached a Compromise With Britain</p>
<h3>Spain Replaces Its Representative Attending Geneva</h3>
<p>(Nanking) The Committee of Nineteen was originally scheduled to meet on the 16th of this month. Currently, due to the Yuguan incident, our representative has requested an earlier meeting. According to diplomatic sources, the Committee of Nineteen will still meet as scheduled, and it is unlikely that there will be any progress on the Sino-Japanese dispute. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yen Hui-ching, China's chief representative, met with League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond this morning. It is said that this was in the nature of a New Year's visit, but the situation in the Far East was bound to be discussed. The Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to meet on January 16th, and it is widely expected that the Chinese representative will urge an earlier meeting. However, the Chinese representative has not yet made such a request, but is closely watching various developments. Foreign Minister Hymans of Belgium, chairman of the Committee of Nineteen, is expected to arrive here around January 14th to discuss future actions with Secretary-General Drummond. The League of Nations is extremely pessimistic about the reconciliation process, considering it doomed to failure. It is expected that when the Committee of Nineteen meets, it will be forced to abandon Section 3 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant and study what can be done under Section 4 of the same article. According to qualified opinions, if it is necessary to prepare a report, it can be negotiated within about half a month. China's attitude is becoming increasingly firm, so the atmosphere for reconciliation is becoming increasingly bleak. The League of Nations believes that China may abandon its previous passive approach and adopt a stricter approach in Geneva and the Far East. This move is particularly in line with the intentions of the Guangdong side, as the Guangdong side has recently sent telegrams to the Chinese representative urging him to insist and not yield.

<p>(Tokyo) According to the Dongbao, British Ambassador to Japan Lindsay visited Foreign Minister Uchida yesterday to propose a new compromise plan regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. This plan was formulated as a result of secret discussions between Foreign Minister Simon and Drummond on December 31. The British Ambassador said that British interests in China are similar to those of Japan, so there is no intention to hinder Japan's new development, but the face of the League of Nations must also be taken into account, otherwise the world will be in chaos, and Britain and Japan will suffer together. The purpose of the British plan is to appease world public opinion and substantially help Japan gain a new position in the Far East, and it is hoped that the Japanese government will carefully consider it. The contents of the proposal are: (1) Do not invite the United States and Russia to participate in the mediation, respect Japan's claims, (2) The mediation committee should not specify its powers, and should be organized by seven countries including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, China, and Japan, and reject the participation of small countries.

<h3>The British Embassy Issues a Statement on the Yuguan Case</h3>
<p>The Japanese Military Actions in North China Do Not Stop</p>
<p>The Japanese Should Be Responsible for Damages to British Nationals</p>
<p>(London) The Chinese Embassy in London issued the following notice: It is claimed that the Japanese authorities have made several requests to Zhang Xueliang to resolve the Shanhaiguan incident. This is completely untrue. Mr. Zhang has never received any request from any Japanese authority in China or Japan, and Mr. Zhang will never consider any proposal to resolve the Shanhaiguan incident unless it is submitted to the Nanjing government. The Japanese attack on Shanhaiguan is part of a pre-planned military operation against China, especially against northern China. Therefore, the Shanhaiguan incident cannot now be regarded as a local incident, nor will it be regarded as a local incident in the future. The Chinese Embassy has requested the Nanjing government to take protective measures for the interests of British nationals in Qinhuangdao due to the Japanese invasion of Shanhaiguan. Mr. Zhang is responsible for stating that Chinese local authorities have always regarded the protection of the interests of Chinese and foreign nationals as their due obligation. However, the Chinese authorities responsible also have the obligation to exercise their legitimate right of self-defense in the event of another illegal attack by Japan. Therefore, the Chinese authorities cannot be held responsible if British nationals' property is damaged during another Japanese attack. The British Vice-Consul in Nanjing has been notified, so under the current circumstances, Japanese Foreign Minister should be warned of the safety of foreign assets in Qinhuangdao for which he should bear significant responsibility. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira visited British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Wellesley this afternoon to explain the Shanhaiguan incident. It is reported that the British Foreign Office has understood that the Japanese government is making efforts to prevent the expansion of the incident, and at the same time, because the local incident in Peiping has great interests for the United Kingdom, it is most concerned about the progress of the incident.

<h3>How to Face the Year 1933</h3>
<p>Time passes. We approach the beginning of 1933. What state will China be in during 1933? What changes will occur? This is a question not only for the Chinese people under imperialist aggression, who are racking their brains seeking an answer, but also for informed people worldwide who are concerned. Since 1929, the global economic crisis has intensified daily, surging relentlessly. The root cause of the crisis is the overproduction of all commodities. The result of overproduction is a general decline in prices. The relentless decline in prices eventually leads to revenue from sales being insufficient to cover production costs, forcing producers to lay off workers and reduce production. The laying off of workers had already begun among the great powers, who advocated industrial rationalization, adopting new machinery and improving factory organization. Overproduction spread and became particularly severe, leading to serious unemployment. As the number of unemployed increased, general purchasing power sharply declined, further exacerbating overproduction. Overproduction and unemployment became mutually causative, creating a seemingly intractable situation.</p>
<p>In recent years, disputes in the international community, such as the general issues of tariff truce, disarmament, and war debts, as well as specific issues like the Sino-Japanese problem, are all inevitable products of overproduction and economic crisis. Due to domestic overproduction, the great powers had no choice but to passively raise tariff barriers to prevent the import of products from other countries and actively expand their military capabilities to seize colonies. Some dreamers then tried to use their eloquent tongues to mediate and avert disaster. This is the reason for the tariff truce and disarmament conferences. The war debt problem became so serious because, after the tariff barriers were raised, Germany could no longer use its surplus goods to pay reparations. Paying reparations in cash was impossible, leading to the open declaration of inability to continue payments. European countries, in turn, argued for suspending war debt payments to the United States due to the suspension of German reparations. Under capitalism, a nation's strength relies on the efforts and plunder of the bourgeoisie, and national fiscal revenue depends on sharing the spoils of that plunder. After the economic crisis, trade sharply declined and industries withered. The tax revenue, income tax, business tax, etc., which were formerly the main sources of national revenue, suffered significant blows. This led even the United States, a nation generally perceived as a land of gold, to be unable to balance its budget and experience such severe fiscal depletion. How could it generously allow the suspension of these enormous war debts? This is why the war debt issue has been repeatedly disputed without resolution. Moreover, the Sino-Japanese problem is an inevitable result of the expansion of surplus goods by Japanese imperialism. I have previously provided a more detailed discussion in my article "Future Actions of Japanese Imperialism towards China." It is clear that all international developments are driven by economic factors.</p>
<p>The theory of cycles of prosperity and decline is not only cherished by our ancient philosophers, but also regarded as sound reasoning by Western economists, as exemplified by the so-called "law of economic cycles." We do not intend to fundamentally deny the law of economic cycles, but we must revise it. Since the beginning of human history, no system has remained unchanged. The brilliant culture is achieved through metabolism. Therefore, the economic cycle is to a social system what the passage of time is to human life. Each cycle changes the content of life, from infancy to youth, from youth to adulthood, from adulthood to old age, from old age to sickness, and from sickness to death. Meanwhile, the young generation rises. The continuation of mankind remains the same, while racial improvement progresses daily. The necessity of system change is like the necessity of experiencing birth, aging, sickness, and death in human life. Therefore, the so-called economic cycle is a revolving lantern-like cycle, but also a spiral-like advance. The silkworm undergoes three sleeps and gradually transforms. The meaning of each of the three sleeps is different. The phrase "time urges people to grow old" applies to the economic cycle, which continues to urge the current system from infancy to prosperity, and from prosperity to decline. We can see from the history of human society and the general course of human life that the current system must meet its end under some crisis.</p>
<h3>Su Bingwen Compiles Report on Japanese Atrocities, to be Sent to Geneva</h3>
<p>=Stalin Invites Su's Troops to Work=</p>
<p>=Su Bingwen Politely Declines via Telegram=</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen's secretary, He Shengda, telegraphed from Vladivostok on the 4th, stating that Su had telegraphed Yan Huiqing, our representative in Geneva, saying that his trip to Geneva might not materialize and asking if the report on Japanese atrocities could be compiled into a book and sent to Geneva. Yan replied approvingly. The report is now being compiled and will be completed by the 8th and sent to Geneva. Stalin, the People's Commissar of the Soviet Union, telegraphed Su Bingwen from Moscow, inviting his troops to participate in labor. Su replied with a telegram, politely declining, saying that he would consider it later. Currently, Su's troops, though living hard lives daily, are in high spirits, performing callisthenics three times a day and studying academic subjects for several hours (starting from the 7th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen has recently shown great interest in Vladivostok's industries, frequently visiting factories and farms. Wang Zaisi, secretary of the Chinese delegation to the Sino-Soviet Conference, recently came from Moscow with a Soviet government representative to Vladivostok to meet with Su and discuss important matters. They will return to Moscow tomorrow or the day after. Furthermore, Su was greatly angered by the news of the fall of Yuguan and plans to return to China soon with Ma Zhanshan, Xie Ke, and Zhang Dianjiu to participate in the war of resistance against Japan. All the soldiers are indignant at Japan's unprovoked invasion of Yuguan and are eager to return to their homeland to serve on the battlefield and repay their country (special dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Comments on the Yuguan Incident</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Invading Yuguan Only a Prelude to Attacking Jehol</p>
<p>Conflict Between Imperialist Powers Ultimately Inevitable</p>
<p>(Moscow) Foreign news agencies reported that the Soviet government's bulletin, "Izvestia," had published an article on January 4th regarding the Japanese invasion of Shanhaiguan, but this was inaccurate. The newspaper only published an editorial today expressing its views on the serious situation in North China. According to the newspaper, after seizing Shanhaiguan, the Japanese troops are in an advantageous position, able to reach Tianjin directly without difficulty and arrive in Beiping within three hours. The occupation of Shanhaiguan is, in fact, the beginning of a long-expected attack on Jehol. "Pravda" pointed out that after discussing the Lytton Report, the League of Nations had shelved the attempt to resolve the Manchurian problem, granting Japan the opportunity to take further military action. At the same time, Japanese imperialism deeply understands that the United States, during this period of political transition, will inevitably relax its policy on the Far East issue. Regarding the question of whether the attack on Shanhaiguan is the beginning of an invasion of North China and Jehol, the newspaper said that the Japanese troops attacking Zhang Xueliang's and Tang Yulin's troops have not yet fully decided on this step. The Japanese are well aware that invading North China and Jehol is not simply a military action. This move could cause the Shanghai incident of last year to repeat itself, inevitably increase international disputes, and further stimulate China's national struggle. Regarding the anti-Japanese forces, the newspaper pointed out that the volunteer armies in Jehol and the remaining volunteer forces in North and South Manchuria are still active. However, it ultimately stated that Japanese imperialism is preparing to invade Jehol and North China and is preparing intensely. Although it has not yet entered the "main event," Japanese imperialism believes that the international situation is favorable to its new adventures. "Red Star," the organ of the Red Army, said that foreign observers believe that the Japanese invasion of Shanhaiguan is another step in realizing the "Tanaka Plan," which is not without significance. Although the plan has been denied by the Japanese, Japan's policy towards China proves its existence. The newspaper pointed out that the hypocritical attitude of the League of Nations and France's open approval of Japanese actions are all beneficial to Japan, and Japan also knows that the current paralysis of American diplomacy will not take strict measures to prevent its actions against Jehol. However, it finally stated that Japan has infringed upon the vital interests of the United States, Britain, and other imperialist powers. Therefore, although no open conflict has occurred at present, there will inevitably be a time of great explosion in the future (TASS dispatch on the 6th).</p>
<h3>Bao Wenwei Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reports on the Yuguan Incident</p>
<p>Requests Instructions on How to Respond</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang's representative, Bao Wenwei, arrived in Nanjing on orders to report everything to the Central Government and Chairman Chiang. He arrived in Nanjing at 9:30 this morning. He stated that the Japanese army's invasion of Yuguan was a deliberate act of aggression, attempting to disturb Jehol and the Beiping-Tianjin area. He Shi'an's regiment valiantly resisted at Yuguan, resulting in several hundred Japanese casualties. Our own casualties were also significant, details of which have already been reported. As of the evening of the 5th when he left Beiping, Brigade Commander He Zhuguo was still supervising the defense at the front lines, and there were no further intense clashes. The Qinhuangdao area was also still calm. Various rumors circulating were inaccurate. Although the Jehol border was tense, Chairman Tang was prepared to defend the territory to the death and had made ample preparations. If the Japanese invade, we will have no choice but to resist and defend our territory. Tianjin was still safe. Chairman Yu, who had been inspecting various counties, had also rushed back to oversee the situation. The generals in North China were all deeply indignant and eagerly requested to fight the enemy. However, resistance against Japan requires an overall plan. My trip to Nanjing is to report to the Central Government and Chairman Chiang on the Japanese army's invasion of Yuguan and our army's resistance, and to request instructions on the overall response plan. I will be stationed in Nanjing for the near future to handle all related matters. Reports that Japan considers the invasion of Yuguan to be a local incident and intends to negotiate directly with Vice Chairman Zhang are absolutely inaccurate. This is purely Japanese propaganda aimed at easing international pressure. The Japanese are accustomed to using this tactic and it is not worth laughing at. I am scheduled to visit Chairman Chiang tonight to report on everything, and will report to various military organizations this afternoon (special dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang's representative, Bao Wenwei, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 7th and met with Chairman Chiang that evening to report on the details of the Japanese army's invasion of Yuguan and request instructions. He will return to Beiping soon to report back (Central News Agency dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang's representative, Bao Wenwei, told people upon his arrival in Nanjing that the claim that Zhang intended to resolve the Yuguan case locally with the Japanese was completely inaccurate. This is Japanese propaganda aimed at confusing the public. Zhang Xueliang, Tang Yulin, and the various generals in the North are all determined to resist the Japanese army's invasion and have made ample preparations for the defense of Jehol. He will remain in Nanjing for some time to handle matters in North China (China News Agency dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<h3>He Chengjun and He Jian Both Send Telegrams Urging Zhang Xueliang</h3>

I pledge to use the elite troops of Shaanxi and Hubei as your rearguard, so that we can recover the fields of Wenyang and wipe away the shame of Kuaiji.

It also sent letters to various organizations, groups, and schools, calling on them to uphold the spirit of the New Year's Day oath and unanimously boycott Japanese goods (special dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<h3>Peace and Security in Beiping Not a Concern</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Dawen said that there is absolutely no problem with the peace and security of Beiping. Military police and constables are working overtime all night, patrolling. The authorities have long been prepared for air defense. The central government is also paying close attention to cultural institutions and is making every effort to protect them. The current rumors are created by traitors and are not credible (special dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Yulin said that since the fall of Yuguan, numerous rumors have been circulating in Beiping and Tianjin. I am leading the city's police to step up patrols to protect the lives and property of the 1.5 million people of Beiping. Do not listen to rumors (special dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Yuguan incident occurred, the Beiping authorities paid close attention to maintaining peace and security. Some rice and flour merchants took the opportunity to raise grain prices, with a bag of flour increasing by 30 cents and a bag of rice increasing by 3 yuan.

<h3>Cai Tingkai Takes Office as Pacification Director</h3>
<p>Cai Issues Inaugural Telegram…</p>
<p>Use the Full Strength of the Entire Nation and People</p>
<p>Fight for Final Survival at This Moment</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Cai Tingkai took office as Pacification Director on the 6th (special dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Cai Tingkai issued a telegram on the 6th: To All Newspapers, In the case of the National Government's Appointment Order No. 66, it is stated, "Special appointment of Cai Tingkai as Director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Fujian, etc." Upon receiving the order, Tingkai is filled with trepidation. Reflecting on the national crisis, which has lasted for over a year, the lost territory of over two million square li in the Northeast has not been recovered, and the wounds from the month-long Battle of Shanghai have not healed. Our army reluctantly withdrew and moved to Fujian, originally intending to thoroughly replenish and await the decision of the central government. Since arriving in Fujian, the entire army has been on standby, ready to fight. Though we are in a remote area, our thoughts are with the borderlands. Recently, Yuguan fell, and Beiping and Tianjin are in imminent danger. North of the Yellow River will soon be lost to us. The volunteer armies outside the pass eat the wind and sleep in the snow, and their calls for help go unanswered. If the volunteer armies are exhausted, the pseudo-regime will gain momentum, and the Japanese will further increase their pretexts. Tingkai is a soldier, dedicated to serving the country, mindful of the duty to risk his life in danger and grieved by the impending doom of the nation. Looking north to Pan and Liao, I cannot sleep or eat. Now, I have received the decree and been entrusted with the defense of a vast territory. I have declined but to no avail and must reluctantly undertake this arduous task. I respectfully took office on January 6th, complying with the order and assuming my duties at the office. While striving to fulfill my local responsibilities, I dare not forget my determination to fight. I hope that all officials of our central government will unite in spirit, eliminate divisions, resolve internal disputes, and concentrate the nation's strength and talent. A national defense and military plan must be established as soon as possible to strengthen the central government and jointly address the crisis. We must use the full strength of the entire nation and people to fight for final survival at this moment. This is a critical juncture that allows no懈怠. Though I am foolish and ignorant, I humbly wish to lead the way, serving the country with all my might. Even if I have to wield the whip and carry the halberd, I will not refuse the labor. I am willing to wrap my body in horsehide and fulfill my long-cherished ambition. In addition to submitting this report, I am sending this telegram to express my thoughts and await your instructions. Cai Tingkai bows. (special dispatch on the 7th).</p>

<h3>Candidates for Ministers of Justice and Education Not Yet Decided</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of supplementing the ministers of Justice and Education had been discussed at the political conference after the Third Plenary Session last year, but it was postponed until now because Sun Ke did not take office. At the end of the year, the replacement of one or two ministers was also informally discussed in Shanghai. Later, due to the sudden change in Yuguan, the authorities felt that it was better to leave things as they were and urged Sun to come to take office as the President of the Legislative Yuan as soon as possible, and requested that he recommend ten legislative members. Of the original 49 members, 13 are still missing. It is possible to first supplement the shortfall based on Shao Yuanchong's case. It is reported that 69 people will be reappointed, and the remaining 30 people will be gradually added in the future. As for the number of supervisory committee members to be supplemented, it is also being considered by Yu Youren (special dispatch on the 7th).</p>

After all the committee members resigned, all parties, recognizing that the Japanese bandits had not given up their ambitions and were still actively invading us to carry out their entire policy of invading China, were driven by patriotism and could not bear to see the association fall into a state of stagnation. Therefore, representatives from all walks of life were elected to reorganize from scratch. Since the formal reorganization and establishment, almost a month has passed, and the association's work has been proceeding without slackening. Checking for enemy goods is the most important work at present, and methods have been drafted separately and will be implemented in the near future (special dispatch on the 7th).</p>

<h3>Japan Actively Prepares for War</h3>
<p>=Will Shift National Forces to Northeast China, Striving for Scientific Modernization of Armaments=</p>
<p>=Improve Current Conscription System, Intensify Training of Junior Officers=</p>
<p>=Mobilize Young Men and Women, Organize Military Training Centers=</p>
<p>=Military Headquarters Directly Guiding Practical Exercises=</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th - The Ministry of the Army has released an article explaining the reasons for its troop increase in Manchuria and for making several important reforms to the army's organization, structure, training, and equipment. While the article doesn't discuss the extent of the troop increase in Manchuria, according to a spokesperson from the Ministry of the Army to a Reuters reporter, Manchuria currently has 40,000 soldiers, but this number will increase to 60,000 or 65,000 within the next two years. The increase will be in the number of people in the main force, not the number of troops. However, the number of special small detachments must also increase. The current four and a half divisions stationed in Manchuria (namely, the 8th, 10th, 14th, and 2nd divisions, as well as a portion of the 7th division, and the 1st and 4th Cavalry Brigades) are all peacetime forces. The peacetime troop strength of a division stationed in Manchuria is less than that of a division within Japan. When a division is sent to Manchuria, a portion of that division is always left in Japan for training new recruits and other important tasks. According to the currently announced plan, this system will be changed in the future, that is, the troop strength of the divisions stationed in Manchuria will be increased, and the number of people left in the country as trainers will be reduced. It is said that the independent railway protection unit, which is a permanent military force in Manchuria and has wartime troop strength, may also need to be increased from the current six battalions to twelve battalions. The tank units, heavy artillery units, railway units, and transportation units must also be greatly expanded so that they can perform their duties of maintaining peace and order in a vast and remote area. While increasing troops in Manchuria, the army is also reducing or reorganizing troops within Japan proper. According to the latter part of the Ministry of the Army's announcement, the proposal to increase troops in Manchuria is in accordance with the Japanese-Manchurian agreement to maintain peace and order in Manchuria. The troop increase in Manchuria is only part of the army's program. In addition, it is necessary to implement long-planned replenishment programs and revise the current conscription system. The so-called replenishment program includes increasing machinery, improving armaments, equipping everything, and special training in new weapons. Ordinary soldiers, reservists, and junior officers must also be given some special military education, totaling 100,000 people. The training includes the use of light and heavy machine guns, airplanes, tanks, automobiles, and radio, as well as protection against poison gas, observation of weather conditions, and surveying land. Special attention will also be given to the training of military dogs. The Japanese army has made rapid progress in this type of training in the past few years. The most important aspect of the required modifications to the conscription system is the recruitment and training of reserve officers, as the existing supply of officers will not be sufficient if war breaks out. In short, based on the Japanese Ministry of the Army's announcement, it can be seen that it has three main objectives: (1) Increase the troop strength in Manchuria and reorganize the entire army; (2) Increase the mechanization and mobility of the army; (3) Improve the existing conscription and training system.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo - Since the incident at Yuguan, all sectors here have become very tense. The Ministry of the Army and the General Staff Headquarters have been holding secret military meetings for days. It is said that the scope of discussion includes not only concrete plans for the military invasion of Rehe, but also the full deployment of national military mobilization within the country. To give an example, the Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of Education have decided on a detailed and specific plan for the military training of young men and women students. According to the Ministry of the Army, the total number of young people across the country who should receive training is 2 million, of which 1 million have already received direct training. Among the young people employed in factories and businesses, currently (in Tokyo) there are 24 privately established training centers under the jurisdiction of the First Division, including Matsuya, Matsuzakaya, Shirokiya, Takashimaya, Dainippon Brewery, Tokyo Shikki, Dainippon Kogaku, and other munitions factories, with active duty officers assigned to directly guide them. Based on this policy, the Tokyo Automobile Industry Association, under the leadership of the Fascists, is actively recruiting young people, planning to establish youth training centers. The Kagawa Prefecture Barber Association has also established the "Seisan Private Youth Training Center," which is scheduled to expand to 3,000 people starting this spring, using two public holidays each month to begin practical training. Furthermore, according to investigations, the Ministry of the Army has designated the following schedule for practical exercises in various parts of the country this month: January 4th, joint exercises in Kurate District, Fukuoka Prefecture; 5th, joint exercises involving 17 townships in Hiroshima Prefecture's youth training and secondary schools; 8th, joint exercises involving 19 townships in Yamashi Prefecture's Kita-Koma District; 11th-12th, joint exercises involving 5 townships in Hiroshima Prefecture's Kita District, youth training, veterans, and middle school students; 11th, joint exercises involving the city of Hachioji and the Santo District in Tokyo; 13th, joint exercises involving Tagawa District, Fukuoka Prefecture; 17th, joint exercises involving three districts in Hiroshima Prefecture's Kita District; 21st, joint exercises involving Fukayasu District, Hiroshima Prefecture. Training for women is also becoming very active, with the organization of women's military control mobilization, women's youth groups, and troop dispatch comfort squads, all with extremely precise training. The principals of 61 private girls' schools in Tokyo have held meetings since last year. As a result, in addition to several sessions of carrying out live ammunition drills and wartime rescue training, they openly dispatched representatives to the military in a concrete negotiation on November 20th last year. It is heard that the Ministry of the Army has decided to mobilize young men and women across the country from this spring, April, to regularly practice military operations and educate them on military knowledge for use in invading China and attacking the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Navy to Practice New Tactics</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reports that the Ministry of the Navy, in view of the increasingly tense international situation, has decided to bring forward the naval special grand exercises, which were originally held every four years. The exercises will be held this summer, centered on the Ogasawara Islands, encompassing a vast area of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Participating units will include the Combined Fleet, various naval districts, major ports, guard ships, reserve ships, etc., totaling 200 ships, plus air squadrons and ground units from various locations, encompassing the entire Japanese Navy. The exercises will focus on the latest tactics, such as dusk and dawn battles, night battles, night attacks, concentrated decisive battles, nighttime bombing and torpedo attacks by aircraft carrier fleets, strategic tracking and contact by submarines, and rapid close-quarters combat by the main fleet against enemy fleets using smoke screens.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Okada's Determination to Resign</p>
<h3>Ambo and Osumi Are the Leading Candidates to Succeed Him</h3>

Government authorities are trying to persuade him to stay because the parliamentary session is about to begin, but the Minister's determination to resign is very firm. Generals Ambo and Osumi are the leading candidates to succeed him.</p>
<p>No Change in Far East Policy After New US President Takes Office</p>
<h3>Roosevelt to Meet with Stimson to Inquire About Everything</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th - After discussing domestic issues with the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives, President-elect Roosevelt is now turning to foreign policy. He has scheduled a meeting with Secretary of State Stimson in New York on Sunday or Monday to be fully informed about the issues awaiting him when he takes office on March 4th. It is said that the withdrawal of US Marines from Nicaragua has greatly improved relations with Latin America, so issues in the Western Hemisphere will be secondary in the Roosevelt-Stimson meeting. The four matters he is most concerned about are war debts, disarmament, the World Economic Conference, and the Far East conflict. Among these four, it is expected that the Far East conflict will receive the most attention, as Roosevelt is deeply familiar with the content of war debts and the agenda of the economic conference, but he has paid less attention to the Far East situation. According to Democratic congressmen who have met with Roosevelt, Roosevelt wants to obtain the most accurate information about the Far East at this time. However, among Democrats familiar with international affairs, no one has studied the Far East in the past decade. Therefore, Roosevelt has no choice but to inquire of Stimson. Furthermore, it has been reiterated in Washington today that the new government does not want to change its Far East policy and has no intention of replacing diplomatic personnel in the Far East.</p>

<h3>To Handle Anglo-Persian Oil Case</h3>
<p>Havas, Tehran, 6th - The Persian government has dispatched a delegation led by Minister of Justice Ali Akbar Khan to Geneva to handle the Anglo-Persian oil dispute. Before departing, Khan stated that Persia's revocation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession was purely an internal affair and that foreigners had no right to interfere. Therefore, if the discussion is only about the revocation of the concession, the Persian delegation will not recognize it. He also stated that if negotiations result in an agreement to grant a new concession to the Anglo-Persian Company, Persia will insist that Tehran be the site for discussing the terms of the new concession.</p>
<h3>Hitler and Papen Jointly Attempt to Overthrow the Current Cabinet</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 7th - Hitler met with former Chancellor Papen on Wednesday to attempt to overthrow Schleicher. They will engage in widespread propaganda throughout Germany to oppose the current government and prevent it from dissolving the current parliament, hoping to achieve their goal of overthrowing the government. Currently, the National People's Party and the Stahlhelm are dissatisfied with Schleicher, and both have important figures who can influence Hindenburg to support Hitler as Chancellor. Therefore, the Nazi Party is making strong efforts to connect with the National People's Party and the Stahlhelm. The financial community strongly supports the Nazi Party's war plan, believing that a right-wing coalition with capitalist characteristics is superior to idealistic syndicalism. However, whether this attempt will succeed remains in doubt, as the National People's Party does not strongly support a Nazi Party member as Chancellor.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 6th - German Chancellor Schleicher met with Prussian Prime Minister Braun this afternoon, hoping to resolve the differences between the federal government and Prussia. The conversation lasted an hour and a half, but it seems that no tangible results were achieved. Sources close to the matter only stated that another meeting would be held soon. Furthermore, after the meeting between National Socialist Party leader Hitler and former Chancellor Papen at the home of their acquaintance Schroeder, rumors arose that the two had reconciled and conspired to oppose the Schleicher cabinet. Today, both men jointly issued a statement strongly denying the rumors, stating that the discussion was only about the possibility of re-establishing a united nationalist front. Their attitude towards the current government has not changed in any way.</p>
<h3>French Cotton Textile Strike</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Lille, France, 7th - Ten thousand cotton textile workers began a strike today to protest the factory's adoption of a system where each worker manages eight looms.

<h3>Soviet-Canadian Cattle-for-Oil Plan Fails</h3>

<h3>Bomb Explosion in Front of Mosque in North India</h3>
<p>National News Agency, New Delhi, 7th - This morning, in front of the largest mosque in North India, a worshipper entered the mosque from the back door and accidentally kicked a bomb, which immediately detonated, seriously injuring two people. The mosque is located in the bustling city center of Delhi, and the loud explosion caused great panic. Customers and employees of nearby shops ran to take cover. Police thoroughly searched the area and discovered two more bombs, fearing that this incident may reignite ethnic disputes.</p>
<h3>Mussolini Writes Book Arranging His Affairs After Death</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 6th - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently wrote a book in which he has clearly arranged his personal affairs after death. Mussolini states that people do not need to search for his will after his death, as he has no intention of leaving a will. However, he has made no arrangements for the political future and his possessions in the world. His only wish is that his body be buried in a church in his hometown after his death, so that it is close to those he loved. However, people must not think that after his death, he will be able to enjoy eternal rest. Great figures who have made revolutions in the world can never have peace and quiet around their coffins after death. Therefore, although he will lose the shackles on his body, he will surely live forever within God.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Beiping Telegram - To the esteemed newspaper offices, in the blink of an eye, it has been a year since the loss of the three northeastern provinces. The violent flames of the brutal Japanese grow ever more fierce. Recently, they have used the violence of the land, sea, and air forces to attack our Yuguan. Although we relied on the valiant resistance of our stationed troops, due to the vast disparity in numbers, we were forced to withdraw. With the loss of Yuguan, the brutal Japanese conspiracy to invade Rehe and Beiping-Tianjin will arrive without delay. At this time of a large-scale enemy invasion, it is truly a critical moment for the survival of our nation. People from all sectors of Beiping, based on the duty of every citizen to act, have initiated a self-defense and national salvation plan. On the [fish symbol] day, the Beiping People's Self-Defense Guidance Committee was established to raise funds and supplies to support the anti-Japanese front-line soldiers, and to assist the government in consolidating the rear defense work. This is specially telegraphed for your information, hoping that you will take note and that all sectors of the country will rise up together to assist the anti-Japanese soldiers, in order to boost morale. The future of the country truly depends on it. Beiping People's Self-Defense Guidance Committee, [fish symbol] printed.</p>
<h3>Japan Massively Expands Military Preparations</h3>
<p>=Enhance Military Preparedness to Cope with International Conflicts=</p>
<p>=Continue Secretly Transporting Troops to Invade North China=</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence - The Japanese Choshu clique has already blatantly invaded "Manchuria." However, it is very afraid of China rising up to fight. Many people believe that it is afraid of the great powers interfering, but in reality, the great powers have no power to interfere. In particular, the United States currently has no way to wage war in the Western Pacific, which is something that the Japanese Satsuma and Choshu cliques have recognized. While they are naturally wary of the great powers, especially of Red Russia, they only intend to further invade China. Looking at the budget recently released by their Ministry of Finance, the army's expenses alone amount to 447,883,000 Japanese yen, of which 114,645,000 Japanese yen is for military equipment improvement, and the expenses for invading the Northeast, including those of the army, navy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Communications, total 186,330,000 Japanese yen. From the above figures, we know that there are two special facts being expressed: First, they are implementing their so-called military equipment improvement, and second, they are increasing troops in Manchuria.</p>
<h3>Military Preparedness Improvement</h3>
<p>The so-called improvement of military preparedness has two sources. One is in view of the international situation, where the military equipment of all army nations is very sophisticated, with balanced allocations of airplanes, tanks, and poison gas. The Soviet Union even has four mechanized divisions. The second is the use of new weapons. The training in Japan is not only lacking in elite personnel but also small in number. If they were to encounter a real war, the Japanese army would find it difficult to cope with the enemy. Therefore, Japan is actively working on improving its military preparedness. The main items for improvement are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Enhancing lower-level officers, increasing the number of officers and military school students (reportedly the first step is 100,000 people).</p>
<p>(2) To supplement the current shortage of junior lieutenants and lieutenants, implement a short-term voluntary officer system.</p>
<p>(3) To supplement the shortage of officers in peacetime and wartime, increase the number of special warrant officers.</p>
<p>(4) Abolish the donation system, making military service obligations equal regardless of wealth, and making the supplementation of reserve and reserve officer cadres appropriate and reasonable.</p>
<p>(5) Establish new training institutions for specialized non-commissioned officers (such as tank and chemical schools).</p>
<p>(6) Recruit young soldiers (under the age of 18) to serve as signalmen and airmen.</p>
<p>(7) Expand flight squadrons and tank squadrons (planning to expand to twice their current size).</p>
<p>(8) Establish new poison gas protection education institutions (modeled after the Soviet system, widespread throughout society, from children to women, all receive this type of education).</p>
<p>(9) Implement poison gas protection education in existing troops.</p>
<p>(10) Improve existing military police dogs and detection dogs.</p>
<p>The expenses for the above ten items are estimated at 12 million Japanese yen, and implementation began in January of this year.</p>
<p>As for the improvement of each division, given the current situation, on the surface, they still have to consider the Washington Treaty, so it is not convenient to increase the number of standing army divisions. Increasing the number of soldiers is also not permitted by the current national situation. Therefore, they are striving to enrich the content. They must increase airplanes, armored vehicles, tanks, direct-firing guns, and radio communication teams in each division. The goal is to be able to achieve the task of not being restricted by regional separation, especially the troops in the three northeastern provinces should be greatly expanded (to be able to control the Northeast Volunteer Army, and at the same time, to be able to invade Rehe and areas within Shanhaiguan at any time). In terms of combat materials, light and heavy machine guns, infantry artillery, grenade launchers, light howitzers, as well as various new equipment for poison gas protection, weather observation, and terrain observation, as well as medical supplies and veterinary supplies, are all being equipped more thoroughly and extensively. The total cost is approximately 9.29 million Japanese yen.</p>
<h3>Increasing Troops to Manchuria</h3>
<p>Regarding the invasion of North China, it is difficult for them to openly say they are attacking, nor can they say they are increasing troops to "Manchuria". Therefore, they only use the name of alternating stationed troops, transferring the 2nd Division, which has suffered too many casualties and has been guarding for too long, back, and replacing it with the 6th Division. According to the General Staff Headquarters' regulations, the duration of the division's stationing in "Manchuria" is from April 1933 to April 1934. However, in reality, the 36th Brigade of Kagoshima received mobilization orders at the end of November 1932 and departed in early December, and has now all arrived in the Liaoning and Jinzhou areas.</p>
<p>At the same time, the 1st Cavalry Brigade of Narashino suffered heavy casualties in the battle in northern Manchuria. Therefore, approximately 1,500 replacement soldiers and over a thousand military horses were transported from Tsuda Osamu (station). Over a thousand cavalry soldiers and over a thousand military horses were also transported from Utsunomiya (station). Other various weapons are being transported secretly, not allowing the general public to know (because the military transport is loaded onto the trains after 12:00 at night, but someone will always find out). The Kyushu area is smaller and mostly located by the sea, so it is easy to conceal. Currently, in addition to the military transport to Kyushu being incalculable, it is difficult to know the number of troops, wounded soldiers, and remains passing through Kashima, Ihi, and Mukatsu stations each time, but the number of transports is secretly recorded by workers at those stations as follows:</p>
<p>Troop Transport: 308 times</p>
<p>Wounded Soldier Transport: 98 times</p>
<p>Remains: 56 times</p>
<p>This is a small statistic from September of last year to November of this year. Of course, there are omissions in between, there will only be more, never less. Now that the 6th Division has arrived in Liaoning, it is feared that it is not just a rotation of troops, and there will inevitably be more alarming actions on the border areas of Rehe and Shanhaiguan.

<p>Result of the Neijiang Conference</p>
<h3>Yang Sen Proposes Equal Distribution of Benefits, Liu Xiang Opposes, Ends in Discord</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Since the retreat of Liu Wenhui's troops, Liu Xiang, Yang Sen, Tian Songyao, Deng Xihou, Liu Cunhou, etc., convened the Neijiang Conference, which officially opened on December 28th of last year and closed on New Year's Day of this year. The conference was nominally to plan for the aftermath and end the Sichuan War, but in reality, it was no different from a conference to divide the spoils of war. Since the deployment of the Liu and Yang armies, they have gained control of no less than forty counties from the 24th Army's defense area, and have incorporated no less than two divisions of the 24th Army's troops. However, those who contributed more received fewer benefits, and those who contributed less received more, which was very unfair. Therefore, the Neijiang Conference was initiated. Those who participated included Liu Xiang of the 20th Army, division commanders Pan Wenhua, Tang Shizun, Wang Zuanxu, and Fan Shaozeng, as well as Director of Political Affairs Gan Jixiong, Director of Finance Tang Dihzi, Yang Sen, army commander of the 20th Army, division commander Qiao Zhongquan, Tian Songyao, army commander of the 29th Army, division commander Wang Mingzhang, Ma Dezai representing Deng Xihou of the 28th Army, Liu Zhaoqian representing Liu Cunhou of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Defense Army, Li Jiayu of the New 6th Division, Luo Zezhou of the 23rd Division, and over fifty others. Yang Sen first proposed (1) Liu Xiang of the 21st Army should open up Yuwan, with all armies jointly stationing troops and establishing offices; (2) All armies should jointly station troops in Chengdu; (3) The 40 million yuan from the Jingyan salt tax should be divided equally among all armies; (4) The defense areas gained from the 24th Army should be divided among the Allied armies. Tian Songyao and Ma Dezai and Liu Zhaoqian, representatives of Deng Xihou, all expressed their agreement. Liu Xiang then said that while the 24th Army has not yet been completely eliminated, the above four proposals cannot be discussed at this time. We should all unite and completely eliminate Liu Wenhui before redistributing, to avoid misunderstandings at this time and giving the enemy an opportunity to take advantage. Tian Songyao agreed hesitantly. Li Jiayu and Luo Zezhou agreed. Yang Sen was disappointed. Thus, the much-publicized Neijiang Conference ended without result and adjourned. Yang returned to Zizhong, Tian Songyao returned to Chengdu, and Liu Xiang returned to Zigong, all mobilizing troops in preparation for war. Thus, the situation in Sichuan has become tense again. The reason why Liu Xiang refused to accept Yang Sen's proposal is that this Sichuan War was initiated by him, and he gained the most territory. Furthermore, he naturally does not want to share the Zigong salt tax with other armies. Opening up the cities of Yuwan is even more problematic. Liu Xiang's success today relies entirely on his exclusive control of Yuwan, which makes it easy to purchase and transport military supplies, and all transportation is convenient. If it is opened up, he will lose his monopoly. Currently, Liu Xiang is still attacking Jiading, Renshou, Jingyan, and Meishan with a large army. Li and Luo are also mobilizing. Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, and Deng Xihou's attitudes are ambiguous, but they are also mobilizing troops, and their intentions are not yet known. However, the Sichuan War will likely become even more chaotic. (January 5th)</p>
<h3>Bandit Xu Plans to Flee to Eastern Sichuan and Enter Hubei</h3>
<p>= Bao Chengqian has dispatched heavy troops to pursue and suppress =</p>
<p>= Tian Songyao telegraphs about the interception =</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu He's remnant bandits fled from Shaanxi some time ago. Xu's bandits fled to the Suiding Tongjiang area of northern Sichuan, while He's bandits fled back to their old nest in Hefeng, western Hubei. Wherever they went, they slaughtered indiscriminately, especially Xu's bandits. Northern Sichuan is mountainous and complex, no less so than the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi. Xu's bandits are disturbing the area and treating it as a new base. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, based on intelligence, telegraphed the 29th Army of Sichuan, under Tian Songyao, to do their best to prevent them from entering. Tian sent the divisions of Li Weiru and Liu Hanxiong to jointly defend Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Guangyuan with Liu Cunhou's Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Defense Army. In the end, the bandit forces were rampant and broke through. Tian telegraphed Chiang to report, saying, "According to a telegram from Commander Li Weiru, the vanguard of Xu's bandits, about 3,000 men, was completely repelled on the morning of the 31st of last month. However, the main force of the bandits continued to arrive, in great numbers. I personally supervised the battle in the Yangbai River and Yinggezui area, killing countless bandits. Our side suffered casualties, including battalion commander He and Yang, and over ten company and platoon commanders, and hundreds of soldiers. According to a transfer telegram from Regiment Commander Xue Yan of Nanjiang, relayed by Brigade Commander Wan Xuanqing, over two regiments of Red bandits have been discovered in the Dahekou area of Nanjiang. In addition to ordering Regiment Commander Xue to intercept and suppress them, I have also dispatched Battalion He stationed in Ba to assist. I have ordered Commander Liu Hanxiong of Guangyuan to lead his troops to Nanjiang as quickly as possible to join forces with Commander Li to suppress the bandits, and have also dispatched the Qin Brigade of Huang Zhengui's division from Mianyang to Guangyuan, and the Luo Brigade to Jiange, to assist in the suppression. I have also ordered the entire Luo Yanqiong Division to advance to Bazhong, under the unified command of the division commander, to coordinate with the central armies and the Shaanxi army, to complete your plan to annihilate the Red bandits in the short term." He Chengjun, who is in Shaanxi to supervise the suppression, upon learning of Xu's bandits fleeing south, immediately convened a military conference in Xi'an and decided to take advantage of the bandit's unsettled state to pursue and suppress them. He has dispatched Liu Maoen and Hu Zongnan's divisions from Shaanxi to Sichuan. As the bandits are planning to flee to eastern Sichuan and enter Hubei to join He's bandits in Hefeng, he has specifically dispatched Xiao Zhichu's division from Shaanxi via Ankang to northwestern Hubei to cut off their communication. Xiao's division mobilized on the 4th and will be able to concentrate at their destination within a few days. He will also convene Yang Hucheng, Sun Weiru, Feng Qinzhai, Hu Zongnan, Xiao Zhichu, and other generals in Xi'an again to hold a military conference to discuss a thorough elimination plan. He is scheduled to return to Hankou in a week. According to other sources, He still needs to stay in Shaanxi to preside. It is not yet determined when he will return to Hankou. Furthermore, Zhushan and Zhuxi counties in northern Hubei have long been occupied by bandits. Recently, the bandits have been defeated by Fan Shisheng's troops, and both counties have been recovered. In southern Henan, Hao Mengling's troops stationed in Luotian, eastern Hubei, have been dispatched to suppress the bandits. Hao has personally led the Wang and Liu brigades out of Tongluoguan, Qingtaiguan, and Songziguan, moving north. According to a telegram from Hao on the 5th, he has reached Wujia Store in Shangcheng County and will join the Henan army to search and suppress the remnant bandits to pacify the area.

<h3>Shen Honglie's Remarks After Returning to Qingdao</h3>
<p>= Effective Measures for Maintaining Security in North China =</p>
<p>= Yantai and Longkou Defended by the Third Route Army =</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Shen Honglie, Commander of the Northeast Navy and Mayor of Qingdao, recently went north with Han Fuqu to meet with Zhang and report on the southward movement of Liu's division in Yantai. After completing his duties, Shen returned to Qingdao. Shen made the following remarks regarding North China: "Although the situation in Rehe has been slightly tense recently, it is not as severe as reported. According to a telegram from Chairman Tang, the area is quite peaceful. His troops and the Japanese and rebel armies have not yet made contact. However, the Liu Guitang troops who recently surrendered to the Japanese and the Cheng Guorui's puppet National Salvation Army are occasionally clashing with the Volunteer Army. The various generals in North China held a conference in Peiping to discuss the defense of North China in great detail. Effective measures have been discussed to maintain security in North China. If the Japanese do invade, the generals are determined to resist to the death, preferring to be shattered jade rather than whole tiles. As for the defenses of Yantai and Longkou, it has been decided that the 87th Brigade of the Third Route Army, under Rong Guangxing, will take over.</p>

<p>The brigade has arrived near Muping and is expected to complete the handover before January 8th. All of the 2nd Battalion of Marines stationed in Yantai will be completely withdrawn to Qingdao. The Navy's defense of Yantai and Longkou is entirely for the service of the country and has no merit to speak of. Although they are withdrawing, if there is unrest along the coast in the future, warships will still be dispatched to patrol at any time to fulfill their defensive responsibilities. I originally planned to take a ship from Tianjin to Weihai Changxiao Island and other places to inspect the coastal defenses, but due to the urgency of sorting out government affairs, I will return to Qingdao first to do some clearing up. In mid-January, I will take a ship north again to inspect."</p>
<h3>The Headquarters for Suppressing Bandits Sends Personnel to Collect and Transport Special Goods from Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: In order to prohibit opium, the headquarters for suppressing bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has dispatched special personnel to set up a collection and transportation office for special goods from northern Anhui in Bengbu. After the office was established, it has formulated the collection and transportation quotas for over twenty counties in northern Anhui, divided into five grades. Over a three-month period, each county ranges from 1,500 yuan to over 100,000 yuan. One collection and transportation officer is dispatched to each county, and over ten people have been appointed. Before leaving, they must first pay a security deposit, which is 3% of the quota. For example, if a county's three-month quota is 10,000 yuan, the collection and transportation officer must first pay a security deposit of 300 yuan. The important counties have mostly been appointed, and only Fuyang, Sixian, Chaoxian, and Lujiang counties have not yet been appointed. Most of those who have paid the security deposit have already left. Many of those who have been appointed but have not paid the deposit are still staying in Bengbu. The regulations for the collection and transportation of special goods in each county in northern Anhui are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Article 1) In order to comply with orders to collect and transport special goods from northern Anhui, this office will dispatch personnel to handle collection and transportation matters in various counties. (Article 2) The collection and transportation officer's term is limited to three months. Within the time limit, they must thoroughly clear out all special goods within the county, supervise the transportation to this office, and transfer them for destruction. The methods are as follows: (A) The procedures are divided into three periods: notification, purchase, and confiscation. (B) In the first period, all households with special goods are notified to report the amount within a time limit, obtain a verification certificate, and pay a monthly fee of 3 jiao. The collection and transportation officer should immediately fill out a report form and receipt. (C) In the second period, all households with special goods that have not reported or have reported falsely and are still hiding them beyond the time limit of the previous paragraph should first sell them at the price approved by the headquarters. (D) In the third period, if they still do not report and sell them during the purchase period, they will be treated as contraband and confiscated and punished after one day. (The time limit for reporting and the time limit for purchasing are determined by the collection and transportation officer and reported for record.) (Article 3) If the collection and transportation officer encounters any obstacles in handling matters, they may consult with the county government or public security bureau for assistance. (Article 4) From the date of arrival in each county, the collection and transportation officer should gradually report the reported situation of each household to this office and dispatch personnel to supervise and affix the verification certificate. (If households with verification certificates affixed according to regulations wish to transport the goods themselves, they may do so.) (Article 5) When transporting special goods, the collection and transportation officer should apply to this office for a shipping permit. (Article 6) If the collection and transportation officer finds any cases of private possession, private transportation, or private sale, or if they are reported by someone and verified, they should immediately submit the contraband to this office for review. If the quantity is within 100 liang, they may consult with the local county government or public security bureau to punish them according to the amount of the unpaid fee, and report the handling situation to this office for record. (Rules for rewarding informants will be formulated separately.) (Article 7) The amount of verification certificates that the collection and transportation officer receives for sale should be paid off in four installments within two months from the date of arrival in each county. One-quarter of the payment is due each installment. The first installment is due in 25 days, the second installment in 15 days, and the third and fourth installments are each due in 10 days. They must also pay a security deposit of 3% in advance and submit a recent four-and-a-half-inch half-length portrait and a guarantee from two reputable shops to this office for verification and record. (The security deposit, photo, and guarantee will be returned after the officer's duties have been reviewed.) (Article 8) The collection and transportation officer shall not reduce the quota or resign midway during the term of office in order to evade responsibility. Article 9 (The collection and transportation officer should supervise the affixing of the verification certificate according to regulations and shall not charge excessive fees.) (Article 10) The collection and transportation officer shall not collect beyond the scope of the area designated by this office. (Article 11) The collection and transportation officer shall report the collection situation to this office every five days for verification. (Article 12) If the collection and transportation officer fails to pay the installments due within five days, this office will dispatch personnel to collect them. If they still refuse to pay in full, the officer will be dismissed and punished. The guarantor will be held liable for compensation. (If there is a shortfall at the end of the purchase period, a fine of one times the amount may be imposed.) (Article 13) If the collection and transportation officer's performance exceeds the quota, they are allowed to withdraw 60% of the excess as a bonus. The best performers will be recommended for commendation. (Article 14) The collection and transportation officer will be issued a seal by this office as a token of good faith. It should be returned after the purchase period. (Article 15) If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they may be amended at any time. (Article 16) These regulations will be implemented from the date they are approved by the headquarters for suppressing bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. (January 5th)</p>
<p>Three Provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui Request the Levy of Import Duties on Foreign Rice</p>
<h3>Intended to Relieve Grain Surplus in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: As foreign rice has been dumped in various provinces along the Yangtze River in recent years, causing rice sales in the provinces to stagnate and farmers and merchants to suffer, the Anhui provincial government has separately consulted the provincial governments of Hunan and Jiangxi, requesting that they consult the Ministry of Finance and promptly order the customs to increase import duties on foreign rice in order to resist it. The provincial governments of Hunan and Jiangxi have both replied in agreement. The original consultation from the Anhui provincial government is recorded below: "According to a report from Li Yunqi and others, the director of the Wuhu Grain Administration of this province, Annam rice has been imported from Shanghai and entered various provinces along the Yangtze River in large quantities, causing rice to stagnate in this province and unable to be transported out. We request a solution to this situation. The provinces along the Yangtze River have long been rice-producing areas. In years of average harvest, in addition to reserving enough food for the people for one year, the surplus has been transported out by tens of millions of dan per year. In addition, this year's harvest is bountiful and grain prices are low, and everyone is trying to sell to other ports to avoid low grain prices harming farmers. Now foreign rice is competing for sales inland. If we do not urgently resist it, not only will the rights and interests flow out and affect the economy, but also the grain surplus in various regions will cause farmers and merchants to suffer. This is truly harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In view of this, this provincial government has immediately increased import duties on foreign rice in order to resist it. In addition to consulting the provincial government of Hunan (or Jiangxi), if you agree, please reply promptly so that we can draft a joint consultation and submit it. We hope to maintain public friendship." (January 7th)</p>

<h3>The Jiaohai Customs Confiscates the Yongchang Ship</h3>
<p>= The Ship was Carrying Japanese Sugar, Evading Taxes and Unloading Illegally =</p>
<p>= The Customs Discovered the Evasion and Confiscated and Punished the Ship =</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Jiaohai customs has confiscated the Yongchang ship and made it public property because it evaded taxes and secretly transported Japanese sugar to Shijiusuo from Dalian for illegal unloading. It was discovered that the Yongchang ship belongs to the Changji Shipping Company in Shijiusuo. The company manager, He Ren'an, usually specializes in transporting Japanese goods from Dalian and other places. Since the customs canceled the Shijiusuo regular customs last year, He thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of. He colluded with the Japanese and jointly purchased three steamships from Japan to transport Japanese goods from Dalian and secretly unload them at Shijiusuo. The amount of evaded taxes is estimated to have reached over 600,000 yuan. This time, the Yongchang ship loaded 8,000 bags of Japanese sugar in Dalian. The captain of the ship, who is Japanese, declared the ship to Haizhou from Dalian. According to regulations, it should go directly to Haizhou and cannot call at another port. However, the ship secretly changed the logbook during the voyage and secretly went to Shijiusuo. After the ship arrived at Shijiusuo and secretly unloaded the Japanese sugar, the Japanese captain of the ship made an excuse and escaped. The first mate (Chinese) then sailed the ship to Haizhou. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by the customs, which telegraphed Haizhou. The ship was seized on the 14th of this month. At that time, the first mate and others knew that things were not going well and all fled without a trace, leaving only lower-level crew members who were not responsible. The company manager, He Ren'an, was panicked upon hearing the news. He secretly went to Shanghai on the 18th to ask the Japanese to find a way to intercede with the authorities, hoping to preserve the 8,000 bags of Japanese sugar, even if the ship was confiscated. It is heard that the customs has decided to confiscate the Yongchang ship. As for the tax-evaded Japanese sugar, in addition to paying the full amount of tax, it will also be punished twice as much to serve as a warning. The customs originally intended to sail the ship to Shanghai. After leaving Haizhou, the internal machinery of the ship suddenly malfunctioned, so the route was changed. It arrived in Qingdao yesterday (the 27th) and is temporarily docked at the Xiaogang pier for repairs before sailing to Shanghai to be handed over to the customs for inventory. Since this incident occurred, the Haizhou Customs has been paying close attention to such ships. The other ships of the Changji Shipping Company have only been sailing to Zhaozha and Shijiusuo in recent days and dare not go to Haizhou again. (December 28th)</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Songxing Bank Failure Case</h3>
<p>The Songjiang Bank failure case, after creditors petitioned the procuratorate, accusing [the bank] of fraud and other crimes, was ruled to be dismissed without prosecution. The creditors then applied for reconsideration. The procuratorate has now sent a letter to the liquidators, accountants Xi Yushu and Xia Sunhuan, requesting them to investigate and reply regarding the causes of the bank's failure and whether the defendants engaged in fraud, embezzlement, or collusion. Based on the review of the bank's account books, they are to determine the amount of bank funds embezzled by the bank manager and directors, the amount of fraudulent accounts, and provide a detailed list and expert opinion. The accountants replied, stating that the documents received by the liquidators were all submitted to the court by the former bank liquidation committee. These documents did not include crucial evidence such as vouchers, making it difficult to make assumptions. As of the liquidation, discrepancies found in the accounts include items listed as mortgage loans with no collateral, items listed as guaranteed loans with no guarantee, and accounts without real names or addresses, totaling over 300,000 yuan. This situation suggests embezzlement and fraud, for which the bank manager is undoubtedly to blame. As for the directors and supervisors, the liquidators cannot provide an assessment based solely on the account books (omission). If the responsible personnel of the bank were ordered to hand over the vouchers and bills, there would be a basis for the assessment. It is reported that the lawyers representing the bank's creditors are collecting relevant documents and drafting a report on the course of events and various evidence, and will send representatives to Beijing to petition [the government].</p>

<h3>Bank Employee Arrested After Embezzling Large Sum</h3>
<p>Hu Fuxiang, an employee of the Bank of China in Hankou, was arrested in Suzhou after embezzling a large sum and fleeing with a prostitute. The prostitute, Zhang Suzhen, was also arrested in Shanghai. Xu, the manager of the Bank of China in Suzhou, requested the Public Security Bureau to send officers to Shanghai to bring Zhang Suzhen and others to Suzhou for handling by the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, Wu, a clerk, interrogated Hu Fuxiang, who confessed that he had worked at the Bank of China since the eighteenth year and had embezzled 16,400 yuan. He met Zhang Suzhen in Hankou and had stolen 10,000 yuan in silver from the bank, which he gave to Zhang Suzhen and another prostitute, Yueying, in two installments for safekeeping. He claimed that after arriving in Suzhou, he had only 4,080 yuan left after paying off debts. After the interrogation, he was detained pending verification.</p>
<h3>Clash Between Villagers and Refugees</h3>
<p>Over a hundred refugees from Hunan arrived at Yinshan Town in rural Suzhou the other day, traveling on seven boats. After landing, they forcibly occupied a primary school and demanded money and rice from the villagers. The security corps sent a team to suppress them, provided them with six yuan for food, and escorted them out of the area. However, at 1:00 PM that afternoon, the refugees returned to Nanchangbang Village and demanded money and rice from a farmer named Jiang. They tied up Jiang's wife with rope and stole five or six shi of white rice. Some of them even fired guns. The villagers became enraged and clashed with them. When the police arrived, over a dozen refugees had been wounded by the villagers' flintlock guns. Six flintlock guns and eight villagers were seized and taken to the police station. The refugees were housed in a temple, and twenty-four wounded refugees were sent to Boxi Hospital for treatment. The county government and county security committee are now convening a meeting of the village chiefs and district security corps leaders to discuss a solution.</p>

<h3>Security Corps Member Shoots and Kills Comrade</h3>
<p>At approximately 9:00 PM on the fourth, a security corps from the city suburbs, led by squad leader Si Zhan胜, was patrolling with a squad of security corps members and resting at the watch post at the Nanmatou outside the South Gate. Two security corps members, Xue Qingyan and Luo Guihong, went out together for entertainment. While walking to the intersection of Hengtou Street, Xue suddenly shot Luo with a live rifle, causing him to fall and die. The next morning, Wu, a trial officer from the county government, along with an investigator, conducted an examination and ordered the strict apprehension of the murderer. The deceased, Luo Guihong, had served in the corps for two years. The fugitive murderer, Xue Qingyan, a native of Hunan, had only served for six months. It is rumored that the motive for the shooting was jealousy.</p>

<h3>Bullet Explodes, Injuring Tinsmith</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the fifth, Wang Jiao, the chief inspector of the County Public Security Bureau, instructed Rui Liansheng, a tinsmith at the Ye Hengchang tinsmith shop on West Street, to add tin to a high-explosive artillery shell to make a seal. Rui initially declined due to the danger, but Wang said that he had separated the warhead and the shell, and had poured out the original gunpowder, so there was no danger. Rui then worked according to Wang's instructions. Unexpectedly, when he applied a hot soldering iron to the warhead, it exploded violently. Apparently, Wang did not know that although the gunpowder in the shell had been removed, there was still explosive in the warhead. With a loud bang, shrapnel flew out, injuring Rui and other tinsmiths nearby, including Zhang Yongqing, Qiu Axue, and Xi A根, totaling four people. They were immediately sent to Jiading Hospital, where Dr. Geng Shiting provided treatment. Rui's left middle finger was fractured and dislocated, and his face, chest, arms, and other parts of his body were seriously injured. He fell unconscious after being admitted to the hospital. Zhang's injuries were also not minor. Rui is still in the hospital and his condition is not out of danger. The other three have been discharged.</p>
<h3>Convict Escapes from Prison</h3>
<p>Liu Shaolan, a native of Waigang, was imprisoned for drug offences. Last year, near the end of his sentence, he was found to be selling red pills in prison. The county government added six months to his sentence and imprisoned him in a solitary cell. Unexpectedly, the prisoner took advantage of the fact that it was difficult for others to see him in the solitary cell and secretly dug a tunnel, escaping at the beginning of the year. After he was discovered, police detectives apprehended him at the home of Liu's relatives in Shagangqiao. He has been sent back to the county for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Military Officer Secretly Carries Large Quantity of Drug Pills</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at the Liangxi Road, Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf, under Gongyun Bridge in this county, when the Liyang-bound steamboat was about to set sail, Wei Jiaqi, Han Zian, and Tao Wenhua boarded the boat and inspected the luggage of a man in a yellow wool military uniform who appeared to be a military officer. The military officer resisted the inspection. Wei and others reported to Chen Zhenling, the seventh patrol officer of the Sixth Team of the Second District of the Provincial Water Police stationed at the wharf, who went to inspect. The military officer also resisted the water police inspection and went to the Gendarmerie Regiment Headquarters to report. Fearing that he would escape, Officer Chen followed him and arrested him, bringing him back to the wharf. Unexpectedly, the military officer's luggage had been taken away by Wei Jiaqi and others. Officer Chen then located Wei and others, who handed over two tins of "Fast Up" and "Fast Poison" pills, totaling two thousand pills. After strict questioning by Team Leader Shi, the military officer confessed his name as Zheng Yang, a native of Hubei, a graduate of the Central Military Academy. He said that he was traveling from Shanghai to Li阳 and had been entrusted by a friend in Shanghai to carry forty-four packets of "Fast Up" and "Fast Poison" pills, totaling eighty thousand pills, worth 1,120 yuan, hidden in his luggage. After the confession, Team Leader Shi immediately prepared a document to be submitted to the District Headquarters of the Second District for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Notes on Water and Land Robberies</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, robberies have been rampant. The following is a record of robberies on water and land: (1) On the afternoon of the third, at about 6:00 PM, three cargo boats from Zha Jiaqiao, Yan Jiaqiao, and Zhouzhuang, fully loaded with goods, left the city for the countryside. Three civilian boats followed behind them. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 PM that night, the six boats reached Fangmatan, when two pirate boats suddenly appeared with over twenty pirates who looted wantonly. None of the six boats were spared, with total losses of around a thousand yuan. (2) Zhang Falin, a resident of Chenwan in the southern suburbs, raises geese for a living. On the night of the fourth, over ten bandits suddenly came, tied up Zhang, and looted wantonly, taking 157 geese, ten yuan in cash, and clothing. (3) The home of Qiu Hongtai in Laohutou Qiuxiang was robbed on the evening of the fifth, with losses of over 300 yuan.

<h3>Cargo Ship Encountered Robbers</h3>
<p>The Xiexing Transportation Company steamer, traveling from Shanghai to Changshu, encountered two small boats at around dawn on the sixth, before the sky was light, at Xiegang Bridge, about ten miles from Kunshan. Each boat carried five or six robbers, who surrounded the steamer from the left and right. The captain stopped the boat and told the robbers that the ship was only carrying cargo and had no passengers, but the robbers did not believe him and still boarded the ship to inspect it before leaving. The steamer then continued forward and, when it reached Xindang Bridge, about five miles from Bacheng in Changshu territory, it encountered a water patrol boat. The police officer asked if the steamer had encountered robbers. The captain immediately told him what had happened, and the water patrol boat instructed him to tow it to Bacheng for investigation.</p>

<h3>Provincial Commissioner Appointed to Collect Road Construction Mu Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department has appointed Chu Zhuoxuan to Changzhou to collect half of the road construction mu tax for the twenty-first year, so that the province can build highways. County Magistrate Zhang is in contact with the Finance Bureau and the Construction Bureau to discuss ways to raise the funds.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<h3>Smallpox Epidemic in Guangbei Counties</h3>
<p>In recent days, smallpox has been rampant in the Jiangbei counties of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, and Dongtai. Many young boys and girls have died, and even many adults are affected. The prostitute households in the southeast camp of Tongcheng have never practiced vaccination, and many young prostitutes have died this time.</p>
<h3>Reorganizing the Old Forts Along the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The General Staff Headquarters believes that the abandoned forts at the old fortresses of Langshan, Fushan, Shierxu, and Lao Gu圩 along the Yangtze River are extremely important for national defense. It is now working with the Ministry of Military Affairs to send members of an inspection team to conduct on-site surveys and then determine a plan for reorganization. Chairman Jiang telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, instructing them to properly station police teams at the four old fortresses before the central government reorganizes them, and to prohibit outsiders from landing, touring, photographing, or surveying without permission. Chairman Gu has telegraphed the county magistrates of Nantong, Changshu, Yiwei, and Jiangdu to handle the matter.</p>

<h3>Fire at Yanglao圩</h3>
<p>The haystack of farmer Feng Zhiguang in Yanglao圩 in the eastern countryside of this county suddenly caught fire the other night. Neighbors tried their best to extinguish the fire, but it was difficult to put it out due to the strong wind. The fire burned until dawn, destroying an estimated one thousand dan of firewood, five rooms of Zhu's housing, and causing losses of about one thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<h3>Banks Plan to Make Credit Loans</h3>
<p>The branches of various Shanghai banks in Zhenjiang, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Shanghai Bank, and China Industrial Bank, in addition to accepting deposits and operating remittances and mortgages, rarely make credit loans to shops. In the past, the deposits they collected were mostly deposited in various money shops. Since the January 28th Incident, they have gradually withdrawn them and deposited them in their head offices, so that the interest income and expenses could not offset each other. Therefore, all banks suffered losses last year. Now all banks intend to operate credit loans after the general closing of accounts. They are currently selecting shops, and can send applications in one month.</p>

After Zhang and Lu seized it, they divided the 3,000 yuan in cash and the boat among themselves. The county government, having received information, first detained the captain of the water patrol team. The second district investigator of the Provincial Narcotics Investigation Office of Xian, together with the twenty-third team of the Water Public Security Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce, went to investigate, and Chen Xiaofeng, Zhang Xiaozhi, Huang Yinqiao, Zhan Daofeng, Wang Xingbo, and patrol officer Yu, among others involved, were arrested and sent to the Yangzhou Investigation Office and the Public Security Bureau. The Public Security Bureau, hearing that the case was related to Lu Yuanxun, chief of the seventh sub-bureau, and the sentry posts under his jurisdiction, specially sent Chief Inspector Lang Huizhang to investigate twice and await verification. On the fourth, the county government approved the request of the Narcotics Investigation Office and sent Zhang Zhaoxiang to the Investigation Office to confront the opium traffickers, while the others were detained in the Investigation Office and the Public Security Bureau.</p>

<h3>Portrait of Mr. Harris</h3>
<p>Mr. Harris is the General Manager for China of the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. He is scheduled to complete one year of service at the Company on April 3rd of this year. For the past ten years, he has held the position of General Manager in Shanghai, and for the eleven years prior to that, he assisted the Company in London. Mr. Harris has dedicated his entire life to the life insurance business. He is the President of the Life Insurance Association of China. In addition to his business activities, he is also an enthusiastic supporter of public welfare, serving as the President of the Rotary Club and the Vice President of the YMCA. The Sun Life Assurance Company that he represents is one of the largest life insurance companies in the world. Founded thirty years ago, the company is considered a pioneer in the life insurance business in China, and is also a major investor in Chinese government bonds. It consistently provides strong support for the development of various Chinese enterprises.</p>
<h3>Understanding Life Insurance and Its Benefits</h3>
<p>(The author of this article is a recognized writer on life insurance matters, having devoted over three decades to this industry. He began his career in London, serving in the life insurance actuarial department of Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada. He then worked simultaneously in the actuarial department of Manufacturers Life Insurance Company. Within a few years, he and his colleagues founded Crown Life Insurance Co. in Toronto, where he served as a managing director. Later, he was hired by China Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Shanghai to reorganize the company, serving as a managing director. Subsequently, he resigned to organize China United Assurance Society, Ltd, a purely Chinese-owned company. It was inspired by the 1911 Revolution, taking the improvement of the national economy as its mission, and pioneering the Chinese life insurance industry. The author assisted in the organization, serving as manager and honorary director for over two decades).</p>
<h3>Life Insurance by 郁赐 S.J. Hughes</h3>
<p>It is difficult to define life insurance in just a few words without using complex scientific terminology. This vast and beneficial social organization is already well known in other countries and does not require further theoretical explanation. However, in China, this kind of public understanding and appreciation seems to be lacking. The total number of life insurance policies in the entire country is probably less than the monthly business of a single foreign company. Therefore, it seems permissible to occupy some space here for the readers' benefit.</p>
<p>Simply put, all kinds of life insurance policies can be considered a form of compensation. This compensation is to guarantee against significant losses by pre-paying a small fee. These losses may or may not occur within a specified period. Fire insurance and water insurance are more easily understood due to their more immediate needs. If the insured event occurs during the insured's lifetime, the insured can receive compensation. Hence, it is easier to popularize.</p>
<h3>Slow Development in the Past</h3>
<p>Life insurance, because the actual beneficiaries are those other than the insured himself, progresses slowly in public appreciation. Those who take out life insurance are not only thinking of their own happiness but also acting out of their natural love and considering those dependent on them. As for themselves, they only get the satisfaction of fulfilling their duties as a son, husband, or father, and the peace of mind that comes from being prepared. Life insurance prevents unexpected events from leaving dependents unprepared, and the examples of life insurance are also ways to encourage people to take out life insurance.</p>
<h3>Originating Centuries Ago</h3>
<p>The origin of life insurance dates back centuries. Friends would agree to pool money to provide relief to the surviving family members of those who died first. This is the beginning of the life insurance system. Outside of China, this system has become very popular worldwide and is an essential element for the well-being of society and the economy. What was once merely a private agreement among a small number of individuals has now become a specialized business. The value of the life of anyone capable of production, and the cost of insuring against unforeseen events, has been accurately statistically determined through the scientific application of actuarial rates and life expectancy.</p>
<h3>Great Significance</h3>
<p>Besides its own specialized science, the life insurance business requires the support of advanced mathematics, statistics, finance, economics, business management, medicine, and law. This article is only the first in a series on the general idea of life insurance. Therefore, we will not discuss the practical aspects of various applications. What is described here is only the great significance of life insurance for the happiness of individuals and society, and for the progress of the national economy. Although the idea of insurance is old, its adoption as a core enterprise of social organization is relatively recent. Its most recent public recognition came during the last World War. President Hoover of the United States once spoke about life insurance during the last election, saying that the last World War caused the loss of 40 million strong men in various countries, which deeply instilled the concept of the effectiveness of life insurance in people's minds. They not only deeply felt the relief provided by the life insurance business but also clearly understood that life should be insured early to prepare for unforeseen events. The deep-seated nature of this concept marked the last World War as the first time in the history of the life insurance business.</p>
<h3>Amazing Progress</h3>
<p>Since that time, life insurance, as the easiest, most reliable, and most economical way to restore a portion of financial losses to those who depend on a producer after his sudden death, has been more widely recognized and accepted by the public. In the recent fifteen to twenty years, life insurance has made amazing progress. If measured by the size of the population, North America, especially the United States and Canada, is the most prosperous. Even the recent impact of economic decline has not only failed to hinder its progress but has, on the contrary, promoted it. The economic decline in the United States was most severe in 1931, but the total amount of life insurance and the increase in assets that year also broke previous records. According to statistics at the end of last year, the total assets of life insurance companies in the United States, including the increase of $1,320,389,000 this year, totaled more than US$20,000,000,000.</p>
<h3>China Can Adopt It</h3>
<p>The evolution of humanity is endless, and the development of society is infinite. Life insurance has experienced amazing development due to the needs of evolution. This beneficial system, which is extremely developed in other countries, can certainly be adopted in China in order to seek the happiness of the people in terms of society and economy. We will discuss this in detail in another article. The author has been engaged in insurance for nearly forty years, and has personally experienced all aspects of the business. Therefore, what I say is not comparable to those who have no experience.</p>
<p>In summary, life insurance is one of the best ways for people to work together to improve human well-being. It makes wealth accessible to ordinary people and distributes it fairly, eliminating poverty. The huge sums of money gathered by life insurance companies are a material expression of various excellent human qualities, such as wisdom, thrift, and sacrifice. Are there those who want to replace the economic system that has developed over many years with social or communist doctrines? The national wealth represented by these insurance companies, that is, the huge sums of money saved by the working masses, is enough to encourage and reward the human conscience, and is a perfect answer for them. The world is changing day by day, and this unique system of self-help and cooperation, tested over a long period of time and adopted by people because of social needs, is now thriving.</p>
<h3>The Meaning and Benefits of Life Insurance</h3>
<p>— Chen Keqin</p>
<p>(1) Meaning</p>
<p>Life insurance is a method for many people to contribute a certain amount of money to prepare for compensating anyone among them for economic losses due to death, disability, or old age. From a social standpoint, life insurance is a strategy to accumulate funds to compensate for economic losses due to death, disability, etc. This kind of loss is transferred from individuals or a few people to be jointly borne by the public.</p>
<p>Generally speaking from an individual's perspective, life insurance is a reciprocal contract whereby the insured pays premiums, and when death or other specific events occur, the insurer compensates the insured or their beneficiary with a stipulated amount of money. The insurer can be an individual, an autonomous organization, a company, or the government. The beneficiary can be the family, business organization, or anyone closely related to the life of the insured (commonly known as the policyholder). This relationship is the insurable interest of the beneficiary in the insured.</p>
<p>(2) Benefits</p>
<p>The most important function of life insurance is to establish a personal life insurance estate to replace the value of life. In addition, life insurance also covers various other economic needs, which can be prepared for the following points:</p>
<p>(1) To repay debts after death. (2) To redeem mortgages.</p>
<p>(3) To guarantee children's education expenses. (4) To prepare large sums for donations.</p>
<p>(5) To prepare for family monthly income. (6) To prepare funds for sustenance in case of disability.</p>
<p>(7) To prepare for retirement and leisure gardens in old age.</p>
<p>(1) To repay debts after death.</p>
<p>Under today's economic circumstances, it is almost impossible for anyone, especially the head of the household, to pass away without outstanding debts. Such as electricity, fire, food and clothing, rent, medical expenses, etc. These accumulated arrears are indeed a burden on the family. However, a life insurance policy can provide funds to repay these debts.</p>
<p>(2) To redeem mortgages.</p>
<p>Loans secured by housing as collateral are debts that the family should first repay when the head of the household dies. Therefore, people with mortgage debts can take out life insurance equal to the mortgage amount in advance. When unexpected death comes, the debt can be repaid with the insurance money. In this way, the head of the household can guarantee that his wife and children will have a house to live in after his death, and can reunite and live the leisurely life they are accustomed to.</p>
<p>(3) Guarantee of children's education expenses</p>
<p>Higher education is becoming increasingly important in the country. The future happiness of children depends entirely on the training they receive in their youth. University education and even secondary education require financial backing. Therefore, parents should prepare a fund for their children's higher education before they pass away. This fund can be prepared through the parents' life insurance.</p>
<p>(4) Preparation of large sums for donations.</p>
<p>Endowments to charitable organizations or educational institutions often cannot be resolved quickly due to the complexity of inheritance lawsuits, the complexity of taxes, and the cumbersomeness of legal procedures. However, the recipient organizations often urgently need cash. Under today's circumstances, cash is much more useful to them than money that can only be received indefinitely in the future. Life insurance allows the donor to have the recipient receive cash immediately upon death.</p>
<p>(5) Preparation of family monthly income</p>
<p>Today, there is another type of policy that prepares the beneficiary to receive monthly income from the company within a considerable period of time. In this way, although the policyholder dies, his family still has living expenses. Most life insurance policies give descendants the right to receive money for several years. However, unfortunately, very few people use this method. After receiving a large sum of money, beneficiaries often waste it on various useless expenses due to lack of experience, or invest it in worthless businesses. Lifetime annuity policies guarantee that the policyholder's descendants can receive a fixed income on time. Therefore, large sums of money will not fall into the hands of inexperienced descendants, or be wasted or deceived into making useless investments. Even if it is not a lifetime annuity policy, a fixed-term annuity policy is enough to provide the family with living expenses until the children have received sufficient education to be self-reliant and have the surplus to provide for others.</p>
<p>(6) Preparation of funds for sustenance in case of disability</p>
<p>Most policies stipulate preferential terms that the policy remains valid if the policyholder becomes totally or partially disabled due to an accident. The content of this clause and the benefits that the policyholder can enjoy due to disability vary. However, generally speaking, there are the following three things:</p>
<p>(A) The premium during the period of disability does not need to be paid.</p>
<p>(B) The policyholder is paid ten units of currency (such as gold yuan, silver yuan, rupees, etc.) per month for every thousand units of currency (e.g. gold yuan, silver yuan, rupees) of the insured amount.</p>
<p>(C) The company pays the policyholder or beneficiary the face value when the contract expires, without deducting the amount of premiums not paid due to disability.</p>
<p>All of these are of great benefit to people who generally rely solely on personal work to earn income for living. Because disability makes them feel more difficult than death. According to the results of a survey, 38% of new life insurance policies in the United States have disability benefits. The amount of compensation that the company allows to pay out each year for the above reasons exceeds 220,000,000 units.</p>
<p>(7) Preparing a retreat garden for old age retirement</p>
<p>In American society, people have a very thorough understanding of the benefits of life insurance to families. However, they still regard the expenses for preparing for old age retirement with indifference. Recently, the importance of the annuity problem has been aroused by the investigation of the total number of old-age dependents in several provinces. Anyone should also consider their own life problems after their productive years have passed, after they have made sufficient preparations for their families. Life insurance can be used to prepare for the sustenance of the family when they depend on him for life. When the family can be independent, he can change the cash value on his policy into an annuity to prepare for his own old-age care.</p>
<h3>The Rumors in Northern Shanghai Have Subsided</h3>
<p>The Japanese Marine Corps Will Hold a Review Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai was originally scheduled to hold a review on January 4th. It was postponed due to rain and rescheduled for 9:00 am tomorrow (9th) at Hongkou Park at the end of North Sichuan Road. The municipal government of this city is deeply concerned that it will cause panic among citizens at a time of rampant rumors. Therefore, it specially ordered the Public Security Bureau yesterday to instruct the public security bureaus of each district to explain to the residents. Yesterday, the rumors in northern Shanghai have subsided.</p>
<p>The Chinese Concession Police Organ Was Temporarily on Alert Yesterday</p>
<h3>The Evening Was Peaceful and the Police Withdrew</h3>
<p>Yesterday was January 7th. The Chinese Concession authorities of this city received a secret report in advance that the Communist Party was going to take action. They specially stepped up precautions in Nanshi. The evening was peaceful. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Alert: Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongen received a report in advance that the Communist Party was planning to stage a riot on the 7th in the name of unemployed workers petitioning the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for relief. He immediately ordered the police stations of each district, as well as the Inspectorate and the Detective Team, to step up precautions temporarily. Starting at 8:00 am yesterday, double guards were posted along all the main roads of Zhonghua Road. At the Social Affairs Bureau in Xiaonanmen, Detective Team Leader Lu Ying ordered squad leader Liu Changdu and others, and Inspectorate Director Gong Xikui sent Inspector Guo Zhenliang and others, to jointly guard with the police officers of the First Squadron of the Police Brigade, and strictly guarded against any gatherings or parades.</p>
<p>Refugee Petition: At 11:00 am yesterday, dozens of refugees gathered in front of the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, demanding the issuance of rice tickets for relief. They were stopped by the guarding police officers. Only representatives were allowed to be sent. Then, Fu Yinian of the Fourth Section, together with the inspector of the Public Security Bureau, persuaded them to leave. Fortunately, no incident occurred until 5:00 pm. The guarding police officers were completely withdrawn.</p>
<p>Postal Service to Shanghai and Shanhaiguan Still Open</p>
<h3>Telegraphs Between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao Also Open</h3>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, regarding the postal and telecommunications problems after the Shanhaiguan Incident, the reporter of the East China News Agency specially interviewed the postal and telecommunications authorities. According to Huang Naishu, Director of the Postal Bureau, after the enemy invaded Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, the bureau received a telegram from the Tianjin Post Office forwarded from the Shanhaiguan Post Office, stating that the employees in the bureau were safe and sound as usual. Although the train only runs to Qinhuangdao, the employees of the Shanhaiguan Post Office continue to work. Regarding the post office in this city, in addition to postal remittances, other letters and packages are also received and sent as usual, without any interruption. Because our army has temporarily withdrawn from Shanhaiguan, but is still continuing to fight bravely and make efforts to counterattack. Also, according to the Telegraph Bureau, telegrams from Shanhaiguan are handled by the bureau staff. Therefore, postal and telecommunications services from Shanghai to Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao can still be unobstructed.</p>
<p>All Sectors Are Concerned About the Jinghao Police Report on Rehe</p>
<h3>Appeal for Resistance to the Death</h3>
<p>The Trade Union of the Two Railways Sends a Telegram: The Trade Union of the Two Railways sent a telegram to Chairman Tang of Rehe, saying, "To Chairman Tang Yulin of Rehe, Jian: In the past year, the Japanese invaders provoked incidents and occupied our Northeast. The pain of the Chinese people has deepened day by day. The righteous army has continued to resist. The ambition of the Japanese invaders has become more and more intense. They have repeatedly attempted to attack Rehe and spy on North China. Fortunately, our executive and the officers and soldiers under his command are loyal to the party and the country and do their best to resist. We are deeply gratified. Now the Japanese invaders have again assembled a large army, intending to invade. Shanhaiguan has fallen and Qinhuangdao is in urgent need of help. The bad news has come, and we are heartbroken. Rehe is a barrier to North China and a fence to Pingjin. The importance of its position is known to the whole country. If Rehe cannot be defended, not only will North China be in a desperate situation, but the future of our country and nation will be unimaginable. The executive is doing his best to be loyal and resisting the enemy to the death. The reputation of the army is admired by the whole world. We also hope that you will supervise your subordinates to continue their efforts to defend our territory and thwart their fierce flames. This association respectfully leads all members of the two railways and vows to be the backing. We respectfully send a telegram to encourage you and await the good news." The Council of the Railway Trade Union of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Directly Under the Ministry of Railways.</p>
<p>Women's Association Sends a Circular Telegram: The China Women's Association for Relief of Northeast Compatriots sends a circular telegram, saying, "All newspaper offices, transfer to all female compatriots in the country, Jian: The Japanese slaves are rampant and invade the Northeast. In our Bai Mountain and Black Water area, there is a bloody storm and the eyes are full of sores. The people of the country share the same hatred and are vowing to destroy this morning meal. However, the enemy's flames are rampant. Now they are sending troops to invade Shanhaiguan. The police report has come, and our hair is standing on end. Shanhaiguan is the gateway to North China. Now that the gateway has fallen, Pingjin is in imminent danger. Fortunately, our soldiers understand the righteousness deeply and resist bravely, giving the enemy a head-on blow in order to destroy the enemy. However, the enemy's strength is fierce and stubborn, and the war cannot but expand. The national situation is critical and in the balance. Our female compatriots account for half of the national population. The rise and fall of the country is everyone's responsibility. Our association was originally organized to unite female comrades from all over the country to provide relief to the compatriots in Northeast China who are in distress. In the future, the responsibility will be even greater. The Japanese invaders are brewing a great war and annexing the world. They have already mobilized the whole country. For the sake of our own defense and national salvation, shouldn't we also mobilize the whole country? We deeply hope that all our sisters in the country will rise up, each do their best, and do their best to work together to provide a solid backing for our soldiers and compatriots in the war zone. The situation is urgent and dangerous. We respectfully send a telegram to appeal." The China Women's Association for Relief of Northeast Compatriots, bow, Zhi Xue Dubi Talks: A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met with Zhongwei Xue Dubi yesterday to ask for his opinion on the loss of Shanhaiguan. Xue said, "The Japanese invaders did not spend a single soldier or a single bullet to get the three northeastern provinces. Their progress is even more unscrupulous. It was expected long ago. However, we do not work hard ourselves and do not plan for self-salvation. We mistakenly rely on the League of Nations and then mistakenly hope for luck. We are sitting and waiting for death. It is extremely painful. Now that Shanhaiguan has been lost and North China is in danger, there is no other way but to fight desperately to seek survival from death. However, resisting Japan must be the central government's greatest and final determination to fight a protracted and deadly battle with the Japanese invaders with the entire strength of the country. Only then can it be of any use. Otherwise, it will be tense for a while, and people will forget it after the event. I am afraid that it will still be unavoidable to follow the old set of so-called long-term resistance or negotiation while resisting. The future is really unimaginable." The reporter also asked, "If the resistance to Japan is implemented, can the internal be united and united?" Xue said, "If the great plan of resisting Japan can be realized, then the trend will be unified, the spirit will be consistent, and anyone with a patriotic heart will definitely be happy to die for saving the country. There will never be any more problems internally. It can be said that the current situation is that national salvation cannot be achieved without resisting Japan, and unity cannot be achieved without resisting Japan. This is what I firmly believe."</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi's Reply to the Abolition of War Association Advocates a United Front Against Foreign Aggression</h3>
<p>Bai Chongxi sent a telegram yesterday to the standing committee members of the Great Alliance for the Abolition of Civil War, saying, "To Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Wu Dingchang, Mr. Du Yuesheng, and Mr. Liu Zhanen, standing committee members of the General Assembly of the Great Alliance for the Abolition of Civil War, Xun Jian: I have read the Qin telegram with respect. I am honored and ashamed to receive your praise. Our country has been plagued by civil wars for many years, and its vitality has been damaged. It is not martial to fight among ourselves. Now the Japanese invaders are pressing down on our borders and the communist bandits are lurking. All of us brothers in arms should pool our wisdom and efforts to unite against foreign aggression and save the country from danger together. Your association's advocacy of abolishing civil war is indeed a key to saving the country. Guilin Province vows to follow this and will never forget it. I respectfully send this telegram in reply, and I respectfully ask for your observation. Brother Bai Chongxi bows, winter."</p>
<p>Jiang Guangnai Stipulates Monthly Donation Methods</p>

<p>The situation of the national customs revenue in the Republic of China in 1921 has now been reported by the Inspector General of Customs to the Ministry of Finance and will be publicly announced. The exact number cannot be ascertained, but its general situation is indeed less than before, because the Northeast customs duties were seized by the Japanese. It is said that the situation of the decrease is slightly less than the tax revenue of the three northeastern provinces before. According to the number of Northeast tax revenues announced by Finance Minister Song Ziwen last year, the average annual revenue is 39 million yuan.</p>

<h3>The Civil Rights Protection League Asks for the Release of Teachers and Students from Pingxiao</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Provisional Executive Committee, the China Civil Rights Protection League has begun to organize the Shanghai branch and rescue the professors and students detained in Peiping. Recently, more than 30 people have joined the league, all of whom are well-known figures in the writing circle, such as Lu Xun, Hu Shi, Hu Yuzhi, etc. Regarding the rescue of the professors and students detained in Peiping, Director Bao of the Peiping Public Security Bureau recently telegraphed to the league's chairman and vice-chairman, Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei, saying that the bureau's arrest of people from Pingxiao this time was based on the central government's order. Therefore, the league specifically telegraphed the Central Party Department to ask for the release of the teachers and students detained but not yet released, such as Ma Zhemin. The telegram from the Peiping Public Security Bureau and the telegram from the league to the Central Party Department are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Peiping Public Security Bureau: Shanghai sent Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei to Jian. I have received the Yan telegram with respect. The bureau's arrest of criminals and search for evidence are all based on the law. Even if they are released after interrogation, they will only follow the law. The summons of teachers and students from various schools this time was based on the order of the Municipal Government, which was forwarded from the Central Government, to assist the Municipal Party Department in handling the matter. Whether they can be released now has been telegraphed by the Municipal Government to the Central Government for approval. I respectfully reply to your inquiry and hope you will understand. Bao Yulin, Director of the Peiping Public Security Bureau, bows.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Party Department: To the Standing Committee of the Central Party Department of Nanjing, Jian: Dozens of teachers and students from Peiping schools, such as Xu Deheng, were illegally detained on December 17 last year. After appeals for rescue from all parties, only a small number of people, such as Xu De, were temporarily released. The rest of the people have been detained until now. They have not been tried in accordance with the law, nor have they been released. In terms of party righteousness and the rule of law, there is really something inappropriate. The association has telegraphed the Peiping Public Security Bureau to ask for it. Director Bao Shidian said that the summons of teachers and students from various schools this time was based on the order of the Municipal Government, which was forwarded from the Central Government, to assist the Municipal Party Department in handling the matter. Whether they can be released now has been telegraphed by the Municipal Government to the Central Government for approval. Therefore, the detention and release of the teachers and students from Pingxiao this time is completely presided over by the Central Government. According to reliable information, there are still elementary school students as young as 14 years old and many middle school students as young as 16 or 17 years old in prison. The Central Government has repeatedly said that it will protect the people and all freedoms, and support democratic politics. However, these children of middle and primary school age are not spared and have suffered illegal disasters. It is really painful. I hope that your association will uphold justice, respect civil rights, and order the Peiping Public Security Bureau to release the detained teachers and students such as Ma Zhemin immediately, and look forward to a telegram in reply. Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the China Civil Rights Protection League, Yu.</p>

He was immediately rushed to the US Naval Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Yesterday, the YMCA in this city received a telegram from Mr. Liang, who was traveling with Dr. Yu, saying that he had escaped from danger.

He is actually an unofficial representative of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>A letter from the Old Russian Emigrant Relief Association says: Respectfully, our Shanghai Old Russian Emigrant Relief Association is currently presided over by Popoff. It was filed in the Emigrant Committee by President Gro in 1929. In 1932, it was submitted to the Emigrant Committee by President Mitzer to prove it, and it was registered in the Joint Association of Various Agencies. The articles of association of our association have been sent to the British and American consulates general for filing, and they have also been filed with the French consul general, and he has ordered the chief of the French Concession Police to approve its establishment in the French Concession in order to facilitate its operation. Our association recently applied for approval from the Joint Association of Various Agencies in Shanghai. The Joint Association of Various Agencies followed the order of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and approved it from August 4 to September 8, 1932 with Document No. 1940. It will send personnel to various cities to raise funds. We sincerely hope that philanthropists will generously donate money and goods, regardless of property or food. Our association would like to express its sincere gratitude to the merchants, banks, and government agencies in Shanghai that have donated generously, and we hope that they will not forget the suffering of these old emigrants. President Pu Baifu.</p>
<h3>Mussolini Telegraphed Wu Jingxiong</h3>
<p>Praise the Soochow Court and Promote Cultural Exchange between China and Italy</p>
<p>The Soochow University Law School is not only famous in China, but also a school of comparative law with a number of international scholars, almost the Harvard of the United States and the West. At the end of last year, it also hired the legal adviser of the Italian Embassy, ​​Gu Siding Tini, as a professor of Italian law. On December 27, Dean Wu Jingxiong met with Italian Ambassador Qi Yano and sent a telegram to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The day before yesterday, Wu received a reply telegram from Mussolini, praising the college's efforts to communicate the culture of the two countries. The original telegram is translated as follows: I have just received the Taiwan telegram and am glad to learn that your school will add a subject of Italian public law and has hired a national legal scholar as a lecturer. This is not only a manifestation of cultural connection between the two countries, but also a splendid and unglorying legal system of your country, so that it can be born from the legal thoughts of Europe for thousands of years. In the future, the cultures of the East and the West will be melted into one furnace, which is really the happiness of the whole world.</p>

<h3>County Public Funds and Properties Office Telegraphs to Request the Allotment of Borrowed Grain</h3>
<p>Jiang Shijie, director of the Shanghai County Public Funds and Properties Management Office, and others, pleaded for the allotment of borrowed grain on behalf of farmers in various townships. Yesterday, they sent a special telegram to the National Government, President Song of the Legislative Yuan, Minister of Finance Song, Director of Finance Shu, and Chairman Gu of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, urgently ordering its implementation. The telegram stated: "Upon investigation of the borrowed grain from Jiangsu Province in the past, an allotment method was established. However, the announcement of the second phase of land price tax collection this year did not explicitly mention the allotment, causing public suspicion. This office has repeatedly received inquiries from district chiefs, local gentry, and farmers in the county. Shanghai County still owes 4.5 yuan per picul for the pre-borrowed grain from previous years. During this collection period, we urge you to truthfully report the situation to the provincial authorities and request them to consider the plight of the people and order an allotment after reviewing the case, in order to demonstrate national credibility." This office dares not withhold this information from above, and therefore sends a special telegram requesting that you urgently order the implementation of the allotment. We respectfully request your approval. Jiang Shijie, Director of the Shanghai County Public Funds and Properties Management Office, and Kang Yongnian, Deputy Director, bow in respect.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Delegation Returns from Beijing to Petition</p>
<h3>Request to Open the Intercepting Dam</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce last year repeatedly received letters from the Miscellaneous Grains Association requesting that the Construction Bureau be appealed to open the intercepting dam. Considering the matter to be of great importance, it was deemed necessary to petition the provincial government. A resolution was passed at a standing committee meeting to appoint Executive Committee member Zheng Zenan as a representative, along with representatives of the industry, to petition the provincial government. These representatives have now returned to Shanghai. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency made a special trip to interview them and obtained the following information. "I was appointed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as a representative, along with Mr. Wang Muyi, representative of the Miscellaneous Grains Association, to petition the Construction Bureau to open the intercepting dam. The reason is that the harvest of miscellaneous grains in northern Jiangsu this year has been very abundant. Local grain merchants transport them to Shanghai, usually via the Grand Canal. However, due to the intercepting dam between Gaoyou and Baoying not being open, they have to detour through Mapeng Bay. Since the beginning of winter, there has been a prolonged drought, and the water in Mapeng Bay is too shallow for navigation. They must still take the Grand Canal directly. We appealed to the Construction Bureau to open the intercepting dam, and they immediately instructed the River Works Bureau to handle it. However, the River Works Bureau stated that there are still over 300 zhang of siltation near the intercepting dam, which must be dredged first before the dam can be opened. However, there are 3,000 to 4,000 cargo ships waiting urgently to go south, with a cargo value of approximately 5 to 6 million. All must arrive in Shanghai before the final settlement of accounts. If they cannot arrive on time, the impact on Shanghai's finance will be significant. Furthermore, the cargo ships are stranded there, and each ship requires daily food expenses, which are substantial. They will inevitably have to exchange goods for money to maintain their livelihoods, and the loss to passengers and cargo is incalculable. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the matter is of great importance and that it is necessary to petition Beijing. Thus, I went to the province on the evening of December 29th and visited Director Dong of the Construction Bureau the next morning, explaining everything in detail. Director Dong also believed that the dam should be opened urgently to alleviate the difficulty. He immediately instructed Section Chief Xu to inform the River Works Bureau by telegram. He also instructed us to go to Yangzhou to meet with Director Xu Dingchang of the River Works Bureau and urge him to open the dam quickly. Thereupon, we crossed the river on the morning of the 31st and transferred to a long-distance bus to Yangzhou. We met with Director Xu and requested him to open the dam quickly to save the merchants from their predicament and the livelihoods of thousands of boatmen. Director Xu replied that he had just taken over the post and that this kind of harm to merchants was a mistake made by his predecessor. Now that the dredging work at the siltation site has begun, it is difficult to stop. This project employs over 2,000 people and should be completed within about a week. Since merchants are eager to open the dam, they should send someone again to supervise and urge the matter so that the dam can be opened as soon as possible." With Director Xu's sincere reply, it is estimated that the dam can be opened by around the 10th of this month at the latest. Therefore, this trip is considered satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Amendment of Diesel Fuel Tax Rate</h3>
<p>Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Luo Fude, Tax Commissioner, issued Joint Proclamation No. 1268, which stated, "Regarding the Joint Proclamation, the Ministry of Finance has ordered that Article 491 of the current Customs Import Tariff of the Republic of China should be amended as follows: 'Original text: Diesel fuel, 2.90 gold units per ton. Note: For diesel fuel imported for manufacturing and refining purposes, an additional tax of 23.40 gold units per ton shall be levied in addition to the original tax rate.' This shall take effect from January 5th of this year, and compliance is required." In accordance with this order, we must comply. The regulations for the management of transporting diesel fuel for refining kerosene have also been established. Copies of these regulations are available directly from this customs office. All merchants are hereby notified. This proclamation is hereby issued."</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Mediate the Labor Dispute at British American Tobacco Factories</p>
<h3>A Solution Has Been Decided; Work Will Resume Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Fourteen child laborers in the box-making section of the new British American Tobacco factory in Pudong went on strike because the employer failed to fulfill the reconciliation record No. 334 of the Social Affairs Bureau. Due to the interconnectedness of all sections, the strike of the child laborers affected more than 4,000 workers, who were all unable to work. To prevent the escalation of the labor dispute, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters have been actively trying to mediate for several days. They also summoned Li Deke (transliteration), a representative of the employer, for persuasion. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Wang Gang from the Third Section, along with Zhang Sheng, the general secretary of the Municipal Party Headquarters, to Pudong to mediate. An agreement was reached by representatives of both labor and management yesterday, and a specific solution was decided: (1) The employer shall comply with the reconciliation record, "The factory shall increase the wages of the workers in the new factory's box-making section, starting from December 1st of this year (i.e., the 21st year of the Republic), as per the usual practice." (2) Workers in the new factory shall resume work uniformly on the morning of the 9th. (3) The difference of one person in the number of workers in the new factory's box-making section shall be resolved separately. The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union has already notified workers to resume work uniformly on the 9th.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association Asks the Municipal Council to Explain the Hotel Licensing Regulations</p>
<h3>Disparate Treatment Between Chinese and Foreigners; A Lack of Fairness</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Settlement sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of applying for a liquor license for Western restaurants in the central district of the Public Settlement, the Daxia Hotel has stated that it has negotiated with the Municipal Council. According to the official, except for existing hotels that already have licenses, new restaurants will not be allowed to apply for them. This kind of regulation is unfair and has many drawbacks. Here are some points of concern: (1) Can the existing licenses be transferred? (2) Can the existing licenses be passed down through generations? (3) Is there a time limit for the existing licenses? (4) Is the issuance of licenses related to nationality? If licenses can be transferred, it is akin to a monopoly. If they can be passed down through generations, they become private property. If licenses have no time limit, the right to sell alcohol will permanently belong to a few. Now, foreign restaurants all have licenses and are close to each other, while Chinese merchants are deliberately hindered. How can this be considered fair? If the Municipal Council is truly concerned about maintaining local order, it can impose restrictions on the time for selling alcohol, such as prohibiting the sale of alcohol before 6 p.m. etc. The current method of issuing liquor licenses can lead to the conclusions drawn by the hotel. If there is different treatment between Chinese and foreigners, it violates the principle of impartiality by the authorities. In light of the aforementioned, we respectfully request that your board consider this matter further and provide a satisfactory explanation." To the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement.</p>
<p>Sales Results of Charity Horse Race Tickets</p>
<h3>To Conclude on the 10th of This Month</h3>
<p>The charity horse race tickets issued recently in this city have been purchased very enthusiastically. All sales outlets are overwhelmed. According to experienced observers, it was known that they would be sold out. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about the situation with the Municipal Finance Bureau. An official made the following remarks: (1) The process of entrusting sales outlets for promotion: The horse race for charity fundraising was made possible with the support of the Shanghai Race Club, the Chinese Sports Association, the International Sports Association, and various gentlemen and merchants in this city. This is gratifying. However, the matter pertains to fundraising in the urban area, and the promotion of tickets is an obligation of the Finance Bureau. The method of promotion requires collective effort. Therefore, at the beginning, we consulted with various banks, companies, newspapers, organizations, and agencies in this city to serve as sales outlets. Initially, there were only over 30, and later more than 10 others joined, totaling over 40. This shows the enthusiasm and support of all sectors. (2) Number of tickets sold: The number of tickets issued was 110,000, of which 10,000 were complimentary. As of the 6th of this month, the Finance Bureau had received 86,500 tickets and 8,620 complimentary tickets from the Shanghai Race Club for distribution to various sales outlets. Most sales outlets have sold out all of their tickets, and a few others have very few tickets left. The Shanghai Race Club also has only about 1,000 tickets left, which should be sold out in two or three days. (5) Collection and remittance of ticket revenue: The ticket revenue transferred by the Finance Bureau to the Shanghai Race Club, including advance payments and remittances upon receipt, will be equivalent to the number of tickets received. The remaining ticket revenue is being collected from various sales outlets in recent days and will be remitted successively. According to another source, the Finance Bureau's handling of the promotion of tickets is scheduled to conclude on the 10th of this month. The calculation of ticket revenue and other procedures are very complicated and must be concluded a few days earlier. Sales outlets, except those who received tickets with cash, will have their remaining tickets collected uniformly for alternative sales methods. It is also reported that the Finance Bureau has issued a circular to all sales outlets.</p>
<h3>Board of Directors of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation</h3>

<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation held its 18th Board of Directors meeting at the company at 6 p.m. the day before yesterday. The directors present were Wei Yifu, Li Jingcong, Shen Yani, Lin Shi, Wu Zhaoxuan, Smith, Fu Kai'er, and Feng Xike, with Wei Yifu as chairman. The meeting discussed the purchase of aircraft and resolved that two Junkers W33 aircraft, recently ordered, will be used for flights east of Xi'an. Due to the high mountains between Xi'an and Dihua, which make flying difficult, especially in the summer, it was decided to purchase three Junkers W43 aircraft, equipped with Hornet engines. (2) Regarding the salaries of personnel suspended from duty, it was resolved to revise and pass the interim method of granting consolation money to personnel suspended from duty, as drafted by Li Jingcong, Smith, and others. (A) Company personnel (excluding those dismissed for cause or those who resign voluntarily) shall be granted consolation money. However, this method does not apply when the company ceases operations or when contracts are in place. (B) The granting of consolation money shall be in accordance with the following regulations: For service of less than half a year, one-quarter of the monthly salary shall be granted; for service of half a year but less than one year, one-half of the monthly salary shall be granted; for service of one year, the full monthly salary shall be granted, and for each additional year of service, one-half of the monthly salary shall be added, but not to exceed three months. (C) The official salary of personnel suspended from duty shall be calculated on a daily basis. (D) This method shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Board of Directors. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Rice Industry to Use New Standard Rice Measures</h3>
<p>February 5th</p>
<p>The rice industry in this city has always used the Shenhu measure for transactions, which has been issued by the Renhu Association and used for decades. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau ordered the Bean and Rice Industry Association to switch to new measuring instruments as soon as possible and abolish the old Shenhu measure. It was originally scheduled to be implemented in January of last year, and the association had already manufactured more than 600 new measuring instruments with a capacity of eight dou and four sheng, and was informing various businesses to collect them. Unexpectedly, the war broke out in Shanghai, preventing the implementation. The association had submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to postpone the implementation, and after repeated requests and reporting of various difficulties, it was delayed until now. Now that the measurement system has been reformed, the association has been ordered to notify its members to implement it immediately without further delay. The association recently convened a meeting of its members to decide on the date of implementation of the new measuring instruments and to calibrate the new measuring instruments before distributing them to various businesses. It was decided that the new measuring instruments would be implemented simultaneously by the northern and southern rice businesses on February 5th.</p>

<p>Leaders from various industries in the city, to promote Chinese business insurance and protect the interests of policyholders, have organized the General Management Office for Various Industries' Insurance Co., Ltd., located on the second floor of the Silk Industry Bank on Hankou Road.

<h3>China Merchants Public Bus Company to Add Zhenru Express Bus</h3>
<p>Since resuming operations, the Shanghai China Merchants Public Bus Company has been actively reorganizing transportation. Recognizing the large number of educators traveling to and from the Zhenru district, and the inconvenience of locals bringing baskets to the city on the same buses, causing crowding and frequent stops, the company has purchased several new vehicles and converted them into modern passenger buses with comfortable seating. These buses will travel directly from Shanghai to Zhenru without stopping along the way. They are currently being assembled day and night, and will be put into service as soon as they are completed. From then on, transportation to Zhenru will be even more convenient.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Yu Zongzhou to Be Held Today</h3>
<p>The memorial service for Pastor Yu Guozhen will be held at Yongzhi Hall on Xiangyin Road in northern Shanghai at 2:00 PM today. Mr. Zhang Zhijiang has been specially invited to preach. This afternoon, Xiangyin Road will likely be packed with people, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Record of Meeting of Authors and Publishers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Chinese Authors and Publishers Association convened a meeting of publishing organizations yesterday at Zhimei Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. Attendees included Hong Xuefan of the Modern Bookstore, Zhang Xishan of the Kaiming Bookstore, Li Zhiyun of the Beixin Bookstore, Zou Wenqing of the Shenzhou Guoguang Society, Tang Zhejun of the Huatong Bookstore, Wang Zicheng of the Guangming Bookstore, Wang Mengzou of the Yadong Library, Zhang Bingwen of the Pacific Bookstore, Ji Jianhua of the New China Bookstore, and over twenty others. Chairman Hong Xuefan first reported on the recent investigation of piracy by the association's secretary-general, Shi Zuocai, in the Northwest region, and the investigation in Taiyuan on the 23rd of last month with Yang, an inspector from the Beijing headquarters. Over 70 types of pirated books, totaling over 10,000 copies, were discovered at Fan Hua Company, Quan Ji, De Sheng Wen Huan, and other bookstores in the area. The shopkeepers were immediately arrested and taken to the public security bureau. The next day, they were tried, and the dishonest merchants were heavily fined. The pirated books were confiscated and destroyed. Shi originally planned to leave Beijing and continue investigating elsewhere, but after Fan Hua Company paid the fines and pledged to reform, they filed a counterclaim in the local court. Secretary-General Shi believes that although the company is backed by shareholder power, the evidence of their crime is solid, and he will not show weakness. He is determined to do his best to deal with them. In addition to requesting the Booksellers Association to send a telegram to the Shanxi court to uphold justice and punish the dishonest merchants according to the law, he is also planning other countermeasures. The meeting decided that the association should publish an advertisement in various port newspapers to warn pirate booksellers. Publishers who are members of the association should cease all dealings with any bookstore found selling pirated books. Li Zhiyun proposed that the association print a high-quality embossed copyright certificate to be affixed to the copyright page of each book, to make it easier to identify pirated books in various ports. The printing costs would be allocated among the members. This was unanimously approved. Finally, the chairman reported on his investigation of pirated books in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Shantou, and other places, and reported that the Commercial Press had nominated Li Bojia, head of the publishing department, to join the association, and on the collection of special donations for half a month. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Summary of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Chemical Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese Chemical Industry Association believed that Hangzhou has shown great vigor in construction and higher education recently, and that the chemical industry is the foundation of all construction and national defense. Therefore, the 8th annual meeting was specially held in Hangzhou. Attendees included Xu Fengshi, Chen Pingcheng, Wang Jiliang, Cao Liangxia, Shen Xiongqing, He Shangping, Lin Jiyong, Li Shouheng, Yu Xueyang, Wu Zhitian, Gao Bojun, Wang Dong, Cheng Huanxi, Ji Yucheng, Shen Zhennan, Tang Yongjian, Wang Hanzeng, Wang Jicai, Shen Taogu, Bao Bodu, Gu Siqi, Pan Chengqi, Zhang Xiaoting, Xu Fengchao, Li Han, Cheng Enguang, Li Kunhou, Zhu Jingliang, Jin Peisong, Shao Jiajun, Wu Haoran, Chen Zhilin, Cheng Boshang, Dai Qixin, and over fifty others, who stayed at the West Lake Hotel. On New Year's Day, an administrative meeting was held at the Bank of China Villa, passing three resolutions: to promote association affairs, vigorously raise funds, and expand membership. Cao Liangxia and Wu Yunlu were elected as chairman and vice-chairman, Yu Xueyang and Shao Jialin as secretaries, Wang Jiliang as editor, Wang Zhudong as general affairs officer, Cheng Shixi as accountant, and Chen Pingcheng, Lin Jiyong, and He Shangping as councilors. At noon, the Hangzhou branch hosted a banquet at the Tianxiang Restaurant. In the evening, the association hosted a New Year's banquet at the YMCA. Zhou Yangchuan of the Minsheng Machinery Glass Factory, and representatives from Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, Family Industry Society, Chinese Chemical Industry Society, and Tihe Industrial Company provided gifts to add to the festivities. On the 2nd, the association invited the heads of the Construction Department and Education Department, the president of Zhejiang University, and Xu Fengshi and He Shangping to give public lectures at the YMCA. At noon, Lin Jiyong led students from the Fudan Chemistry Department to perform military chemical experiments at the public sports field. The program included liquid fire, bombs, aircraft incendiary bombs, smoke bombs, tear gas, and choking gas. Afterwards, the two departments hosted a public banquet at Jufeng Garden. In the afternoon, they visited the West Lake Condensed Milk Factory, the Minsheng Machinery Factory, the Minsheng Glass Factory, the Meilili Paper Factory, and the Zhejiang University College of Engineering. In the evening, Zhejiang University hosted a banquet. On the morning of the 3rd, the association held a presentation of papers at the College of Liberal Arts of Zhejiang University, with sixteen papers presented. In the afternoon, an industrial film was shown in the auditorium, featuring seven reels of the actual work of Hengxin Foreign Firm and Zhenhua Lacquer Company. In summary, the association held a grand propaganda meeting in Hangzhou at a time when our country's industry is backward and military affairs are strained, making the general public, who are immersed in pleasure and natural beauty, aware of the importance of the chemical industry for national defense and all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, hoping to awaken them to promote it. Therefore, its significance is very serious. However, it is a pity that newspapers were suspended, and news of the association was not published. This summary is specially presented, which is hoped to be what those who are interested in the chemical industry are concerned about.</p>
<h3>News from Various Provincial Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Minnan Fellow Association held its 22nd board meeting yesterday, chaired by Qiu Hanping. It was resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry of Interior, urging Xiamen to be quickly established as an independent city. The original telegram is recorded below: To Song, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, and Huang, Minister of the Interior: Xiamen is one of the earliest trading ports in our country, guarding the throat of southern Fujian. Much of the trade with Southeast Asia starts here. Recently, many Fujianese have returned to the country, and investment has gradually increased. However, because Xiamen's municipal administration has historically been under the jurisdiction of the navy, management has been poor, and malpractices have been rampant, hindering its orderly development. The recent decision by the provincial government to change Xiamen into a city is in line with the wishes of the Fujianese people. We earnestly request that it be implemented quickly, and that the selection of the mayor be made carefully. We are eagerly anticipating this. Respectfully, the Shanghai Minnan Fellow Association.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Huining Fellow Association held a standing committee meeting on January 3rd to discuss various cases. (1) Regarding the holding of the association's 10th anniversary celebration and the 10th general membership recruitment, it was decided that the 10th recruitment would begin on February 9th and end on April 9th, followed by the opening of the 10th anniversary celebration and entertainment event. The detailed rules of procedure will be decided at a meeting of the various preparatory committees on the 8th of this month (Sunday). (2) Regarding the 10th election of the association, due to the postponement of the 9th election due to the war, it was postponed to June 1st. The term of office of the 9th committee is only half a year. Regarding whether to reschedule the election, it was decided to wait until after the end of the 10th general membership recruitment to determine the date of the election. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Dried Goods Industry Union</h3>
<p>The preparation of the Shanghai Dried Goods Industry Union has been completed. After applying for permission from the Party and government authorities, the inaugural meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the auditorium of the General Labor Union in the city. More than 150 members attended. Chairman Yu Yaoqiu reported on the preparatory process. Subsequently, an election was held, and Zhu Bofeng, Cai Jiugao, Fei Zugen, Hu Ting, and eleven others were elected as directors, and Wang A Jin, Qian Liang, and five others were elected as supervisors. They were then sworn into office and nominated responsible persons to begin drafting improvements to labor-management conditions for submission to the Party and government authorities for mediation.</p>
<h3>Talent Sought by the Vocational Guidance Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Office was entrusted yesterday by a certain organization in the city to hire a staff member who is proficient in both Chinese and English, skilled in translation, and has ample knowledge and experience in documentation (English typing skills are preferred). The monthly salary is approximately 60 yuan. Candidates should bring their work samples and contact the office every morning for interviews. Furthermore, a certain organization has commissioned the recruitment of investigators for the sugar industry, hardware industry, and tea industry, with those familiar with the content and business conditions of each industry being qualified. Those interested may visit the office at 80 Hualong Road for a personal interview. According to statistics released by the office for December of last year, 617 vocational consultations were conducted, 455 talents were registered, 53 business assignments were commissioned, and 34 individuals were successfully placed.</p>
<h3>Long Mao's Postdated Checks Unredeemable Due to Bankruptcy, Lawsuit Filed</h3>
<p>Long Mao Textile Company went bankrupt due to financial difficulties, owing more than one million yuan. It is currently being liquidated. The company issued a large number of postdated checks. Upon maturity, the company had already collapsed, and the holders of the checks were unable to redeem them, leading to lawsuits. The responsible parties of the company, Yang Xixian and Zhang Bingjun, have been repeatedly sued by creditors. Yang has fled to avoid punishment, and Zhang is also hiding in various places. Yesterday afternoon, during the summons by the First Special District Court, neither defendant appeared. Only Zhang's defense lawyer appeared in court, requesting a postponement. However, the lawyers for the plaintiffs Sun Zikui, Wang Baoyu, and Zhan Hongsen, Wu Linkun and Wang Fuchang, stated that the postdated checks held by the plaintiffs from Long Mao amounted to more than 100,000 taels of silver. To protect the interests of the plaintiffs, they had requested that the defendants be released on bail, but unfortunately it was not approved, allowing the defendant Yang Xixian to escape. Now, the second defendant, Zhang Bingjun, has also failed to appear. The lawyer's claim that Zhang has left Shanghai on business is unbelievable. Zhang even met with this lawyer this morning to discuss settlement issues. If he had the sincerity to settle, he could have surrendered to the authorities and requested a postponement to facilitate settlement. Instead, he falsely claimed to have left Shanghai, hoping to delay the matter. This clearly shows that he not only lacks the sincerity to settle, but also has the suspicion of deceiving the court. It is requested that a warrant be issued for his arrest to protect the interests of the plaintiffs. Judge Zhang then ordered a postponement until the 9th of this month to summon the defendant for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Schoolboy Shot Dead with Hunting Rifle</h3>
<p>Zhang Guosheng Suspected and Accused</p>
<p>Wang Genxing Dies Tragically for No Reason</p>
<p>Wang Changchun, a farmer in Dongwei, Ershisi Tu, Dongnan Yuanbei City, Tangqiao, Pudong, is over fifty years old and has only one son (the only son in Wang's fourth branch), named Genxing, who is ten years old. He cherishes him like a treasure. He is currently studying at Dongxiang Yaojing Elementary School. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 PM on November 23rd of the lunar calendar, Genxing was returning home from school and, while passing the intersection of Nanqing Village, was suddenly struck in the left temple by a stray bullet. The bullet did not pass through, and he fell to the ground and died on the spot. At the time, Genxing's classmates Wang Xirong and Wang Xigen were walking with him and witnessed a person wearing a Western suit, holding a long gun, and carrying a yellow armadillo. After the incident, he ran away frantically. Wang Xirong and others immediately reported to Wang Changchun, who arrived and mourned over the body. He reported the information to the township office, which forwarded it to the district office, and requested officials to be sent to examine the body, put it in a coffin, and await the arrest of the perpetrator and the investigation of punishment. Wang Changchun is now suffering from unbearable grief over the tragic death of his only son. After investigating and confirming the surname of the murderer, he filed a complaint with the authorities the day before yesterday, stating that his son Genxing was actually killed by Zhang Guosheng, who lived in Xitang, Yaotu. This has been proven by Wang Rong and Wang Xigen. (According to the complaint, Zhang Guosheng is the only person in a Western suit in this village.) It is said that there were no other hunters on that day, and that the defendant Zhang Guosheng often carries a gun to hunt birds and animals, and keeps a hunting dog, which is well known in the village. After the defendant caused the incident, he fled without a trace and instructed his uncle, Zhang Xiaodi, to hand over the long gun and scattered beads to the security regiment as a way to deny the crime, which actually serves as proof. Now, he is still at large, which is truly unbearable. If he is not arrested and investigated, how can the injustice be avenged? Therefore, he requests that the defendant Zhang Guosheng be strictly arrested, punished according to the law, and that the law be upheld. It is ordered that we wait for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Shop Owner Punished for Bribing Guarantor</h3>
<p>The Fuli Hat Factory at No. 339 Yuezhou Road, previously submitted a statement to the First Special District Court guaranteeing the case of the defendant Tang Zaiheng. Following routine procedure, the court dispatched translator Chen Shidi along with police officers in a court vehicle to the Fuli Hat Factory to investigate whether it was a reputable business to determine whether to approve or reject the guarantee. The manager of Fuli, Yuan Shixun, fearing that the investigation would reveal that the business was not qualified to be a guarantor, ordered his son, Yuan Shanfu, to instruct shop employees Zhang Quantai and Xu Shouchang to intercede with Chen and others, and offer them four dollars as a gift, claiming it was a small amount to cover transportation costs. This behavior was clearly bribery to deceive people. Chen Shidi immediately presented the money to Court President Guo Yun'guan and reported the bribery by Yuan and others truthfully. President Guo was shocked and angry. In addition to issuing a notice strictly prohibiting litigants from bribing public officials, or public officials from soliciting all kinds of illegal fees, and allowing reports to be filed and investigated according to the law, Prosecutor Zhang of the court's prosecutor's office issued a warrant to summon Yuan and his son, Zhang Quantai, Xu Shouchang, and others to investigate. At the conclusion of the investigation, it was determined that the evidence of bribery of public officials by these individuals was conclusive and unforgivable. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed in the corresponding criminal court. Judge Zhang Junqing opened the court for a clear hearing. Yesterday afternoon was the day for the verdict. Yuan and the other four defendants and their defense lawyers did not appear. Judge Zhang then announced the verdict: Yuan Shixun, Yuan Shanfu, Zhang Quantai, and Xu Shouchang were each sentenced to two months in prison for bribing public officials, and the four dollars of bribery money was confiscated. This severe punishment should serve as a warning to others.</p>

<p>The "Strange Hero Zhang Jiuguan" play performed by the Qitian Stage not only involves gods and monsters, but also takes character names such as Cheng Tianlong, Chen Fengchun, Li Mingqiu, Fang Maolin, Chen Rongsheng, and Chen Pangui from lotteries. The Municipal Education Bureau believes that the harm of lotteries to the people is no different from a flood or a wild beast, and is known to all. Taking names from lotteries for the play is akin to promoting them, which violates the prohibition. The stage was ordered to remove the parts about gods and monsters, and to change all the character names taken from lotteries. It has now been heard that the Municipal Education Bureau has ordered the Actors' Union to notify them that they have not complied. If they continue to ignore the orders, they will be strictly banned. A script application form was attached and forwarded to each stage. In the future, each stage is instructed to pay attention to newly compiled scripts and to apply for review according to the law.</p>
<h3>Dual Assault Leads to Litigation</h3>
<p>≡Noodle Bowl and Wine Bottle Used as Weapons≡</p>
<p>≡Both Defendants Receive Suspended Sentences of Detention≡</p>
<p>Li Qiu-ding, a Korean woman residing at No. 35, Lao Guan Li, Jiaxing Road, went out to buy noodles around 1 a.m. on the 23rd of last month. Upon returning to her doorstep, she was accosted by Zhang Jin-de from Yancheng, Chen Si-quan from Anhui, and Cha Zheng-fa, all heavily intoxicated. Mistaking her for a prostitute, they began teasing her. Li, speaking in Japanese, cursed at them. Zhang and the others continued to follow her, leading to mutual insults. Li, greatly angered, threw the noodles she was carrying at them. Zhang and the others, equally enraged, started fighting. Her husband, Zhao Bing-xuan, a Korean man, hearing the commotion, came outside and struck Zhang Jin-de on the head with a wine bottle, knocking him to the ground. Li also sustained minor injuries to her back and abdomen. The Hongkou Concession police, both Chinese and foreign, arrived after being alerted and arrested the three men, taking them to the police station. They were later sent to the First Special District Court. Zhang Tian-yin, the police lawyer, recounted the events, stating that the victim, Li Qiu-ding, was eight months pregnant and, after suffering injuries to her abdomen, was admitted to Fumin Hospital at No. 412, North Sichuan Road. Doctors found that the fetus had stopped breathing, posing a serious danger. She recovered after several days of treatment. The defendants claimed at the police station that Li was actually a prostitute and that they intended to go inside to have fun. However, investigations revealed that the house where Li lived had indeed been a brothel in the past. Li Qiu-ding then explained her version of events, accusing all three defendants of assaulting her. Her husband, Zhao Bing-xuan, testified that he owned a ginseng shop at a certain address on Ximen Road in the French Concession, leaving early and returning late. On the day in question, his wife Li Qiu-ding went out to buy groceries and was harassed by the three defendants. He used a wine bottle to injure the first defendant's head. Zhang Jin-de and the others insisted that the plaintiff was a prostitute. They claimed that they were drunk and went inside to solicit services, seeing many women there. After agreeing on a price for the night, two Korean men attacked them with a stove and iron tools, causing injuries. They denied hitting Li Qiu-ding. As the testimonies differed, Judge Zhao ordered them to be remanded in custody pending judgment. Yesterday morning, at the Third Criminal Court, Zhang Jin-de, Chen Si-quan, and Cha Zheng-fa were each sentenced to fifty days of detention, with a three-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>First Special Court Hears Bribery Case Against Sanyou Factory Bosses Yesterday</p>
<h3>Court Orders Rehearing 丨丨丨</h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Company in Yinxiang Port, Pudong, has led to the company officials bribing the standing director of the Seventh District Cotton Textile Workers' Union, Gong Yuting, to halt labor union activities. Gong subsequently handed over the 200 yuan bribe, along with a report on the incident to the labor union and Bureau of Social Affairs. The labor union, alleging that the company officials had publicly committed bribery in violation of criminal statutes, retained lawyer Wei Wenhan to file charges with the First Special District Court. The court granted the request and summoned a fifth criminal court hearing to be held on December 27th of last year. Due to the defendant, Shen Jiucheng, failing to appear, the official ordered a rescheduling of the hearing. The following is a detailed record of yesterday’s continuing trial.</p>
<h3>The Opening of the Trial</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, judge Liu Yugui, accompanied by court clerk Huang Haiyun, was seated in the fifth criminal court to begin the hearing. The plaintiff's representatives, Zhang Wenhai and Gong Zishen, defense lawyer Wei Wenhan, defendants Shen Jiucheng, Wang Xianhua, Chen Wanyun, Cen Zihou, Lao Huimin, Li Daofa, defense lawyers Tan Yigong and Yu Zhongluo, and witness Gong Yuting, all appeared on time. The judge began by questioning the defendant, Shen Jiucheng, who testified that he had indeed relinquished his duties at the Sanyou Industrial Company on November 25th of last year. He explained that he had been unable to attend the previous hearing due to illness in Hangzhou and was now appearing in court despite being ill.</p>
<h3>Witness Testimony</h3>
<p>Witness Gong Yuting then testified that the Sanyou Company had not sought a legitimate resolution to the labor dispute and instead sent representatives Li Daofa and Lao Huimin to collude with worker Xia Zhongzhao, instructing him to meet with Gong at the Great World Entertainment Center in early November of last year. Later, they met at the Oriental Hotel. Gong, believing that there was no harm in meeting as the dispute had not been fully resolved, agreed to attend. However, the discussions resulted in no agreement and the meeting ended without resolution. At the end of the same month, Xia Zhongzhao notified Gong, instructing him to meet at the Great Southern Restaurant. Gong refused. On December 3rd of the same year, Xia Zhongzhao said, "The company has instructed me to give you one hundred yuan for your use. You just need to give me a receipt." Gong refused. On the 6th of that month, Xia Zhongzhao notified Gong to meet with the defendants, Lao Huimin and others, in a room surnamed Chen in room 228 of the Zhongzhou Hotel. Gong agreed to attend. At the meeting, Gong found Lao Huimin, Li Daofa, Xia Zhonghai, Xia Zhongzhao, and Zheng Xiangrong present. Lao Huimin then stated that the company was willing to pay Xia Zhongzhao and Gong two thousand yuan, and other responsible parties one thousand yuan. The only requirement was that Gong and Xia cease union activities and allow the members to resolve the dispute on their own accord. Gong reluctantly agreed. Following the meeting, Gong immediately reported the incident to the union and submitted the bribe money to the Bureau of Social Affairs. A receipt was provided as evidence.</p>
<h3>Rehearing Ordered</h3>
<p>The court ordered that, as the details of the case required further investigation, and Xia Zhongzhao needed to be summoned for questioning, the hearing would be rescheduled for 2:00 p.m. on the 11th of this month. At that time, many factory workers were listening to the trial in the gallery. The defendant's defense lawyer, fearing that the workers would surround the court, requested that the court prevent such action. The court advised the listening workers to await the lawful resolution of the labor dispute and refrain from any unproductive actions that might violate the law. The court then ordered the workers to leave first.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Estate Dispute of the Late Tycoon Qiu Weiqing</h3>
<p>≡Sixty-Year-Old Concubine Faces Off Against Adopted Son in Court≡</p>
<p>Following the death of the late paint tycoon Qiu Weiqing, his adopted son, Changsheng, was sued in the First Special District Court by his concubine, Sun, and his sister, Zhu Qiu (Weiqing's biological sister), on the grounds of attempting to seize the inheritance and failing to provide for the safe upbringing of his underage biological children, Changyin, and others. The circumstances of the hearing at the end of last year were reported in this newspaper. Yesterday (the 7th) afternoon, the court's Judge Qian reopened the case in the Second Tribunal. First, the plaintiff's legal representative, Zhang Shizhao, stated that he was requesting the dismissal of the second defendant, Chang Shuliu, and the third defendant, Ren Yian, as it had been verified that everything was initiated by the first defendant, Qiu Changsheng, and they did not wish to cause further complications. Qiu Sun, with assistance, stood in the plaintiff's column. Zhu Qiu, who was ill and unable to attend, stated the intent of the lawsuit. Due to deafness making it difficult to respond, the representative, lawyer Zhang Shizhao, stood up to state that the first plaintiff, Sun, was the concubine of the late Qiu Weiqing, and the second plaintiff, Zhu Qiu, was Weiqing's sister. Before Weiqing's death, he arranged for Shuying, the daughter of his concubine Jia, and his son Changyin to be adopted into Sun's name to be raised by her. Furthermore, due to the adoption by his legal wife, Zhou,</p>
<h3>Changsheng, the Adopted Son</h3>
<p>had reached adulthood. Fearing that his biological children were weak and vulnerable and would be subject to abuse by relatives, he specifically stipulated in his will while ill that all property should be managed by his nephew, Sheng-san, until his biological children reached adulthood, at which point Changyin and others would be allowed to inherit. However, in January of 1925, Weiqing passed away, and Changsheng immediately took back all the inheritance from Sheng-san and divided it. Changsheng, as an adopted son, seized forty to fifty percent of the inheritance, while five to fifty percent was placed under the name of his biological child, Changyin, disregarding his stepdaughter Shuying. Relatives were neither named nor</p>
<h3>consulted about this illegal division of property.</h3>
<p>Sun, unable to bear witness to it, went to Hangzhou for medical treatment. Both biological children were cared for by their biological mother, Jia, so there were no concerns. However, on March 4th of last year, Jia also passed away due to illness. The defendant, Changsheng, immediately seized the opportunity, forcibly opening the locked safe with the intent to steal the inheritance. Fellow villagers, feeling indignant, reported the incident to the police, who then sent officers to guard the safe for more than ten days. In addition, he argued that even the residence on Tongfu Road was not a husband acting like a real man but rather a woman making accusations.</p>
<h3>Money is the Root of All Evil and Causes One to Be Bullied</h3>
<p>"Pockmarked" Liu Hangs Himself in Anger</p>
<p>Liu Wenbing, known as "Pockmarked," of Jingjiang, currently residing at No. 395 Dongyangjiazhai, Lan Nidu North, Pudong, worked at the Xiaoshedud ferry plant. Due to owing a debt to a fellow villager, Cao, of No. 208 Hutang Street, the latter came to Liu to demand payment. As Liu was unable to pay, Cao slapped Liu several times. Liu, as a man, felt ashamed to be slapped by a woman. In such circumstances, money was the only cause. In a moment of anger, he secretly hanged himself at home in the afternoon. Liu only had one sister, Liu Abao, who lived with him. When she returned home and discovered the suicide, it was too late to save him. She reported the incident to the Third District Police Department, who detained Cao. Yesterday, police officer Xie Along reported the incident to the local court. Prosecutor Zhang and others were dispatched to the scene for investigation. After confirming the death, they ordered the family to prepare the body for burial and await further instructions.</p>
<p>The biological child Changyin was supposed to be in the possession of, was also seized by Changsheng. The security measures Jia had employed during her lifetime to prevent Changsheng from harming her son were extremely strict, with the house divided into sections separated by electric fences. Now, the defendant has taken advantage of the deaths of Weiqing and Jia, one after the other</p>
<h3>stealing the property and lives of the orphans</h3>
<p>and placing them under his control. He calls it the "Organization of Management Committee," but in reality, it is to isolate Changyin and others from their relatives so that he can carry out his malicious plan of infringement. Therefore, the first plaintiff, as the adoptive mother, and the second plaintiff, as the aunt by blood relation, are both unable to participate in the upbringing of the two orphans, and the defendant Changsheng's premeditated infringement is clearly evident with existing evidence. Therefore, they jointly file a lawsuit, requesting legal punishment. The defendant's defense lawyer stated that the plaintiff, Qiu Sun, had signed an agreement severing ties with the Qiu family and thus had no right to sue. The second plaintiff had no familial relationship with Jia and thus could not file a lawsuit under the relevant self-prosecution laws. The lawyer argued that the case should first be dismissed on procedural grounds. The plaintiff's lawyer, Zheng Wenkai, argued that whether the separation agreement was valid or not, since it was obtained through</p>
<h3>deception and fraud</h3>
<p>was a matter of civil law and had no relevance to the case. Furthermore, Sun, being sixty years old, would never sever her family ties with her adopted son after her husband's death, so Sun herself was one of the victims, as had already been stated in her complaint. As for Zhu Qiu, after the death of her brother, his will was violated, and his property was seized. As for the orphans, a meeting of relatives was not legally convened to jointly fulfill the responsibility of guardianship. Therefore, her personal legal rights had also been clearly infringed upon, and she had the right to seek redress, the lawyer stated. Judge Qian then stated that there was no need for either side to argue further about procedural law, as the court would proceed according to law. Having</p>
<h3>legal basis</h3>
<p>But Changyin and others have always been raised by Sun, which is not difficult to see from the separation contract. The defendant should try to reconcile outside the court in accordance with humanity and law. In accordance with the law, the self-prosecution case should be withdrawn by the self-prosecutor, and the procurator's consent should be sought. In a case that applies to public prosecution or self-prosecution, the original hearing allows the parties to choose on their own, and there is no big difference. Since this case is a family issue, it is best for both parties to negotiate and reconcile, otherwise each should do their best to provide evidence in order to conclude the case quickly. The self-prosecuting attorney requested bail because the defendant had failed to appear at the previous protest, and was ordered to be released by attorney Wang, with an order to be present whenever summoned.</p>
<h3>After Swallowing Opium and Red Pills, He Knew He Would Die and Cried Aloud in Bed</h3>
<p>Suicide with a Difficult-to-Express Secret</p>
<p>Pan Xiangfu is Truly Pitiful</p>
<p>At the Qianjixian Inn, located in front of the Nanchezhan Road District Court, a man checked in the day before yesterday, registering as Pan Xiangfu, 32 years old, a local resident from Chenjiaqiao in front of the South Railway Station. He worked as a lineman at the China Merchants Electric Company. He booked room number eight and stayed for two days, appearing depressed and deeply troubled. The tea server paid attention. Yesterday at 11:30 AM, this person suddenly cried loudly in bed. The tea server inquired, but he initially refused to speak. Seeing a note on the table addressed to Xu Jinfu in the repair line department of China Merchants Electric Company, he realized it was a suicide attempt. After repeated questioning, he confessed to smoking two small opium bubbles and swallowing two red pills, knowing he was about to die, hence his sorrow. When asked why he was committing suicide, he firmly refused to say, stating it was a difficult-to-express secret that outsiders should not know. The tea server reported to the police, who sent him to the Second District Police Station, then to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but it is unknown if his life can be saved.</p>
<h3>Repeatedly Chopped with Fourteen Axes</h3>
<p>Wang Maosheng's Life is in Peril</p>
<p>Nasal Septum Split Open, Assailant Escapes</p>
<p>At approximately 9 PM last night, Wang Maosheng Lumber Mill on Jiaozhou Road in Western Shanghai employed Wang Aimei, a 44-year-old man from Haizhou, as a night watchman. While patrolling the mill, three strangers arrived and, without explanation, attacked Wang with axes. He was struck seven times on the head, three times on the left arm, and twice on the left hand and right arm. His face, particularly his nasal septum, was severely lacerated. He fell to the ground in a pool of blood. Wang cried out loudly for help, startling the assailants, who fled. Passersby heard the commotion and alerted the police, who arrived and transported Wang to Baolong Hospital for treatment. His injuries are reported to be critical, and his life is in danger.</p>
<p>Hu Shengfang Steals Goods... Attempted Murder... Throws into the River</p>
<h3>Boatman Rescues Four Lives, Truth Comes to Light</h3>
<p>Ren Xinghui, a 21-year-old from Pinghu residing on Huade Road in the northern part of the city, had an acquaintance named Hu Shengfang from Changzhou. Several days prior, Hu stole clothing and other items belonging to Ren's cousin, Li Hongsheng, worth over one hundred yuan, and fled with the loot. Li and Ren searched diligently. Yesterday around 5 PM, Ren encountered Hu, and demanded the return of the stolen items. Hu replied that he had already pawned everything. "If you want the money, you can come with me to Pudong to get it," Hu said. Ren, believing him, followed Hu to the Ningshao Wharf at the Dongmen Road intersection in the South City, intending to hire a boat to cross to Pudong. Unexpectedly, Hu suddenly pushed Ren into the river. A passing boatman saw him fall and quickly steered his boat over to rescue him. Ren was saved from drowning. Seeing Ren being rescued, Hu, realizing that Ren would not let the matter rest and would likely turn him in, panicked and decided to commit suicide. Seeing the rushing river before him, he jumped in. The boatman, having just rescued one person from the river, was astonished to see another person jump from the wharf. He rescued Hu as well. The boatman handed both men over to Officer Chen Rongji, who brought them to the First District Police Station. After a preliminary investigation by the district chief, he ordered a formal report and interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Shot Rings Out in the Bathhouse</h3>
<p>Around 7 PM the night before last, two thugs entered a bathhouse on Nanmatou in the First District of the South City and argued with a patron, Jin. Without warning, one of the thugs drew a pistol and fired at Jin. The bullet grazed Jin's left side and struck the cement floor, creating a hole. Jin stood frozen in shock while the thugs fled. Nearby police officers heard the shot and investigated, but everyone inside the bathhouse remained silent, and no one dared to testify. The First District sent senior officers to investigate, but they only found the bullet mark. The investigation is ongoing.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Finds Abandoned Gun</h3>
<p>Zhong Lihuai, a native of Jiangbei, supports himself by pulling a rickshaw. Around 2 PM the day before yesterday, Zhong was waiting for customers at the intersection of Malan Road and Pubai Road in the French Concession. A man, around 20 years old, wearing a green short shirt and trousers, jumped into his rickshaw, urgently ordering Zhong to pull quickly. Zhong immediately set off at a brisk pace. Suddenly, several people came chasing after them, and a police whistle sounded behind them. The man secretly placed a pistol in Zhong's rickshaw without him noticing, jumped out of the rickshaw, and fled. Zhong, seeing the man's hurried arrival and sudden departure, was bewildered. He could only accept his bad luck. In the evening, Zhong returned to the rickshaw lodging at No. 15 Huining Road outside the Dananmen in the South City to return the rickshaw. While cleaning the carriage, he lifted the carriage lid and was shocked to find a pistol. He immediately reported it to the lodging owner, Yu Dajin, who reported the incident to the Third Substation of the First District. Director Jin determined that the gun was a 4-inch Browning pistol, number 98285, with five bullets still in the chamber. Due to the nature of firearms, he ordered a report to be submitted to the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau for verification.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: At 5 AM on the 2nd of this month, several acid storage vats at our factory exploded due to gas combustion. The explosions were loud but caused minimal damage. We are still shipping goods as usual. The report in your newspaper on the 7th, in the local news section, which stated "water boiler explodes, destroying a house," is entirely inconsistent with the facts. We request that your newspaper promptly correct this report to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Tianyuan Chemical Factory Office, January 7th.</p>

<h3>"Who is the Creator of Evil?"</h3>
<p>| Message from Mr. Wang Lide</p>
<p>Reference to this column, December 29th</p>
<p>The question raised by Mr. Wu Jiaying in your newspaper on December 29th is: "Who is the creator of evil?" The intention is to explain that in the tragedy of social interaction between dancing girls and dance patrons in Shanghai dance halls, the protagonist is the dancing girl, because she is the initiator, while the man is passive. Therefore, he confidently states: "Clearly, the initiator is the plaintiff, while the passive party is accused of rape. Individual crime is established here, and the creation of social degradation also lies here." In reality, this is probably Mr. Wu's subjective view. We must ask, what is the purpose of today's urban dance halls? What need do they meet? Frankly speaking, today's dance halls are disguised prostitution, and not the "Changsan" (high-class courtesan) type of prostitution, but the "Yaoer" (second-class courtesan) type, even the street prostitutes on the main roads. The lower class is equivalent to the "wild chickens" of Sima Road and Beijing Road. In today's industrialized cities or commercial ports where goods are produced, the majority of women naturally cannot escape the consequence of rationalized production—the general rule of overpopulation. They cannot find work and become unemployed, so they naturally become prostitutes, simply transforming their labor to provide spiritual exploitation for the wealthy. Dancing girls are a higher form of this type of unemployed woman selling her labor in this way. When dancing girls dance with people, it is not the mutual enjoyment of dancing between two sexes in an ordinary social setting. She is subject to the free choice of the dance patron; she does not have the freedom to choose which guest she dances with. This is the same as serving customers in a "tangzi" (brothel) or responding to a "jupiao" (call slip). Therefore, unless there is an actual act of crime and a dancing girl is accused of rape by the plaintiff on the spot, we cannot consider the dancing girl to have been raped, because in reality, she not only provides entertainment through dancing but also inevitably tends to satisfy people's desires with her body, and this is a universal fact. However, if the dance patron uses this argument to defend his innocence, then he is wrong. Since we acknowledge that the dance hall is a place of prostitution, then if you go to a place of prostitution, you originally intended to flirt with the dancing girl. "Once you enter a place of right and wrong, you will become a person of right and wrong." Since you have entered a place of right and wrong, you are there to seek trouble. How can you place the blame entirely on the dancing girl? That is somewhat unfair. I want to say something fair: dancing girls and dance patrons are "half a pound and eight ounces" (equal). It is true that dancing girls often make unreasonable accusations or have to meet in court because they are abandoned halfway or because the dance patron has some money and they take the opportunity to extort money. All in all, the damnable private property system harms people. They are constantly influenced and encouraged to commit such crimes. Among the dance patrons, there are many "chai ba dang" (confidence tricksters) who specialize in sleeping with dancing girls. Of course, there are also some young masters who are cheated by them, but to say that men are entirely passive is unfair and not factual. Therefore, the open debauchery of dancing girls and dance patrons is an inevitable phenomenon in today's urban society. In that case, today's urban society is the creator of this evil. Then we ask: What is the result of today's urban society? It is formed by the method of production and relations of production under the current private property system. The day that we trace the origin, the so-called "creator of evil" mentioned by Mr. Wu is the aforementioned social relations of production. When we observe today's dance halls from the perspective of our materialistic sociology, it is truly a place of crime. If we want to find a way to "eliminate this cause," then on the one hand, everyone must rise up to do the work of "removing the root and blocking the source" and transform this breeding ground for evil. On the other hand, everyone should promote legitimate forms of entertainment as much as possible or encourage young people to study and reduce the opportunity for young people to be in dance halls. This is one aspect. On the one hand, from the social perspective, do everything possible to find work for women so that the majority of them have legitimate jobs. On the other hand, let them equally enjoy legitimate social interaction and legitimate entertainment, and equally encourage them to read and study, and increase their upward aspirations. Who would want to do this "civilized flesh business?" This is the second aspect. However, if the work of "removing the root and blocking the source" is not accelerated, then the latter two methods are only "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the feet when they hurt," and their effectiveness is visible. Understanding this point, then questions such as "Will Shanghai have fewer crimes if there are no dance halls? Will Shanghai have fewer shortcomings if there are no dance halls?" will be easily solved. Because Shanghai's dance halls are the product of Shanghai society; but the shortcomings of Shanghai society are not the product of Shanghai dance halls.</p>

<h3>Southwest Political Affairs Committee Education Reform Committee Announces Outline for Education System Reform</h3>
<p>Abolish Winter and Summer Vacations, Divide School Year into Four Semesters</p>
<p>Shorten Study Periods for Elementary, Secondary, and Higher Education</p>
<h3>Committee Chairman Zou Lu Expresses Views</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 7th, Reuters Telegram - The Southwest Political Affairs Committee's Education Reform Committee announced the following outline for education system reform: (1) Abolish the winter and summer vacation system. (2) Shorten the length of study to five years for primary education, five years for secondary education, and three years for higher education. (3) Divide the school year into four semesters: the first semester from July to September, the second semester from October to December, the third semester from January to March, and the fourth semester from April to June. (4) Have a one-week break at the end of each semester.</p>
<p>▲Zou Lu Expresses Views: Zou Lu, chairman of the Education Reform Committee and president of National Sun Yat-sen University, expressed his views, stating that winter and summer vacations are merely habits and have no special reason. If it is said to be due to severe cold and heat, then Sweden and Norway should study for half a year and rest for half a year, and it should be impossible to establish schools in Nanyang and Africa, but this is not the case in reality. Moreover, most of China is in the temperate zone and does not have severe cold or heat, so this issue should not arise. If it is said to be for the purpose of mental and physical recuperation, then society is not limited to scholars, so why do farmers, workers, and merchants not have winter and summer vacations? Even if scholars are engaged in mental labor, there are more than just scholars in society who engage in mental labor. Moreover, after the abolition of winter and summer vacations, in addition to weekly holidays, there are still seven days at the end of each semester, which is more rest than that of farmers, workers, merchants, and other social service workers engaged in mental labor. Moreover, studying is like sailing against the current; if you do not advance, you will retreat. If you expose yourself to it for a few days and then freeze yourself for a few days, how much can you achieve? Based on these reasons, it is advocated to abolish winter and summer vacations and to shorten the school year, namely five years for primary education, five years for secondary education, and three years for higher education. Because with winter and summer vacations, primary and secondary schools only study for forty weeks each year, totaling two hundred and forty weeks for six years, and universities only study for thirty-six weeks each year, totaling one hundred and forty-four weeks for four years. If winter and summer vacations are abolished, primary and secondary schools can study for forty-eight weeks each year, totaling two hundred and forty weeks for five years, and universities can study for forty-eight weeks each year, totaling one hundred and forty-four weeks for three years. If this is the case, the study time is the same, but the graduation time is greatly reduced. (1) It is beneficial to national finances, (2) It is beneficial to the national economy, (3) Education is easier to popularize, and (4) Talents are easier to cultivate widely. During this time of national crisis, the people should intensify their work, which is especially necessary. However, for this system to be implemented, it is necessary to increase teachers' salaries in order to provide teachers with savings or retirement funds. Vacation rules for teachers should also be implemented so that after several years of teaching, they can have one year of vacation to increase their knowledge and recuperate their bodies and minds.</p>
<p>Special Appeal to College and High School Students Nationwide to Practice Education to Save the Nation (11) You Huai Gao</p>
<h3>(12) How College Students Should Begin Work</h3>
<p>1.  Every college student and one high school student, or two high school students, form an education to save the nation group, named the [Province] [County] [District] [Village] Number [Number] Education to Save the Nation Group.</p>
<p>2.  They must be assigned by the "[County] Education to Save the Nation Association" before being assigned to work in a certain village.</p>
<p>3.  They must implement their work under the guidance of the "Education to Save the Nation Association," but they have the right to suggest methods.</p>
<p>4.  After arriving in the countryside, they must consult with members of the local "[District] Education to Save the Nation Advancement Association" to discuss and arrange matters.</p>
<p>5.  Select a suitable civilian residence to establish a school, but do not use forceful means to occupy it.</p>
<p>6.  Clean up the doors, windows, roof, walls, and ground of the house. Repair what needs to be repaired, and paint what needs to be painted. The association will guide the methods.</p>
<p>7.  Arrange the playground.</p>
<p>8.  The association will allocate all expenses and equipment related to desks, chairs, paintings, teaching materials, paper, pens, as well as bedroom, kitchen, and toilet supplies.</p>
<p>9.  Convene a meeting of villagers.</p>
<p>10. Prepare teaching materials.</p>
<p>11. Recruit students to enroll in school.</p>
<p>12. Implement education under the guidance of the association.</p>
<p>13. Conduct surveys under the guidance of the association.</p>
<p>14. Implement military training under the guidance of the association.</p>
<p>15. Implement other work under the guidance of the association: (1) Organize cooperatives, (2) Organize agricultural improvement societies, (3) Organize machinery engineering offices, (4) Organize medical and pharmaceutical societies, (5) Organize rural clubs.</p>
<h3>(13) The Duties of the Education to Save the Nation Association</h3>
<p>The Education to Save the Nation Association in each university and high school can be called the [School] Education to Save the Nation Association, which is similar to the previous student associations in each school. Because teachers and staff can be invited to participate together, this organization is the source of the cause of saving the nation and the organization that produces teachers. Therefore, after implementation, it will become a kind of preparation and examination organization. Therefore, every college and high school student must study education and research education in school during their studies, and during vacations, they can go to the village of their classmates or to their own village to conduct investigations and internships to prepare for their work after graduation. There is another extremely important matter, that is, every Education to Save the Nation Association is a very thorough examination organization, examining the achievements and behavior of each student in the village. These are the two responsibilities of the Education to Save the Nation Association in each school. The Education to Save the Nation Associations in each school can organize the [Province] Education to Save the Nation Association in a province, and then the Education to Save the Nation Associations in each province can organize the National Education to Save the Nation Association, but there must be absolutely no political role, so that the true meaning of saving the nation will not be lost, because saving the nation is an external matter, not an internal matter. There is also an Education to Save the Nation Association, which uses the county as a unit, and its name can be called the [Province] [County] Education to Save the Nation Association, which is organized by teachers from all villages in the county and convened and organized by the county magistrate. It is a formal organization and is subordinate to the Education to Save the Nation Association in each province, district, and city. Therefore, this County Education to Save the Nation Association also has two responsibilities, that is, connecting the Association above and connecting the villages below.</p>

<p>▲Hujiang Defeats Xiaguang The competition in the first 20 minutes was very intense, because Xiaguang was also not an ordinary team, repeatedly thwarting the enemy with its strong strength. The two teams were evenly matched and made contributions to each other. The score was very close, with Hujiang only leading 24 to 19. In the second half, Hujiang's momentum suddenly increased, and Feng Nianhua and Wu Guolin were particularly brave, repeatedly showing their prowess.

<p>Sun Jinshun is indeed extraordinary and makes a name for himself unexpectedly. Youyou defeats Fashang.</p>
<h3>Western Union First Group Victory</h3>
<p>= Result: 3 to 1 =</p>
<p>= Sun Jinshun Scores Two Goals Alone =</p>
<p>The skills of a famous general are indeed extraordinary. With the effectiveness of the two great generals, Sun Jinshun and Huang Ruihua, they were indeed able to defeat the French Chamber of Commerce. On the Western Union First Group scoreboard, they have won once, adding two points. Since the formation of the team, they have been in a losing position in every match, except for two draws, avoiding a shutout. From now on, heroes from across the country will surely flock to join them. Sooner or later, Youyou (the team) can recapture the past glory of the Sanyu team. This all depends on the efforts of those in charge.</p>
<p>(Reputation is well-deserved) Sun’s fame is known to all, even women and children. With the announcement of his participation, five to six thousand Shanghai fans gathered, an unprecedented event for a Youyou match in recent years. Sun Jinshun is a famous "iron leg," his shots sharp, powerful, and magical. Since Li Huitang left Shanghai, we have not seen such amazing skill for a long time. Donghua's Li Yichen occasionally possesses it, but his movements are still not fast enough. Yesterday, Youyou won by three goals. The first goal was a gift from the opponent, actually created by Sun Hupei's efforts. For the second goal, in the sunlight and shadows, Sun’s iron leg kicked, and with a resounding "bang," the ball was already in the net, surprising the goalkeeper and delighting the spectators. For the last goal, he broke into the empty city alone and, with a sudden bang, the enemy's goal fell. From then on, Youyou’s victory was secured. His name is first on the list of merits.</p>
<p>(Full of vitality) Huang Ruihua, who has been a soldier for more than ten years, is once again seen by us on the playing field. The welcome he received is conceivable. His passing and receiving are still amazing, but his interceptions are somewhat diminished. According to rumors, Huang has been neglecting his training recently, and his skills are not yet fully honed. Given some time, he will surely return to his former self. In addition, the performance of the other nine players was also different from the past. Right-winger Chen Bogui made great contributions with Sun's guidance. The forward Ye Pumian and the inside back Qian Yaobin did their best in defense. Xi Qisheng is gradually improving. The overall situation was such that there were many surprising peaks in the first half, and the team suffered double the pressure from the opponent in the second half. Although they won, it was a nerve-wracking experience.</p>
<p>(Failure to reach the goal) The French Chamber of Commerce came with the determination to win, but faced with Sun and Huang, one inside and one outside, they were helpless and fell into a disadvantage. By the end of the game, the entire army advanced and attacked fiercely, and Youyou, which had the advantage, had to retreat to defend its territory and protect its land. Their Marseille had outstanding talent, and no one could approach him alone. Goalkeeper McNally, left-winger Foucault, and right-inside Fafan also had amazing skills. Therefore, there was always hope of recovering. For want of a final effort, they failed to complete their plan, failing to score due to a lack of shooting skill.</p>
<p>(Enemy Reverses) Before three o'clock, the stadium was full of fans, craning their necks and staring, waiting for the Iron Head and Iron Leg. Before long, a burst of applause, and two teams entered the field one after another. Youyou was on the south side, deploying its formation. The French team kicked off, and as soon as they started moving, Huang Ruihua rushed out from the center and passed it to his old partner, Sun Jinshun. Remy could not stop him, and Marseille did not dare to be careless, immediately intercepting the ball and sending it forward. Ye Jinmian took the lead, meeting the ball with his head before it landed, and Sun Hupei got it. He let the horse go wild in the west, dribbling straight to the baseline, and crossed it with all his might. Marseille saw that things were not going well and hurried to block the Iron Leg, but the ball crossed in front of the goal, and the forward, Garnier, panicked. The ball bounced off his thigh and into the net.</p>
<p>(Goalkeeper Shows Off) Now that Youyou had scored a goal, the forwards became more and more successful. Shen Bogui was as slippery as a freed rabbit. He received a long pass from Shi Jinsheng and went into the hinterland alone again. Sun Iron Leg caught up, and Shen passed it low to the center. Iron Leg shot hard, and McNally punched it out, but it was stepped on by Huang, who dribbled into the enemy's camp again. At a suitable spot, he shot at the goal, accurately and quickly. McNally jumped up and tipped it into a corner kick to escape danger.</p>
<p>(Iron Leg's Masterpiece) The French Chamber of Commerce was able to barely survive because</p>
<p>they launched another attack. Huang Ruihua's two fists could not beat four hands, causing the enemy to penetrate deep into the hinterland. Fortunately, the two generals, Qian and Wang, successfully rescued the situation. Liang Guanlian and Guan Congrong dealt with the situation calmly, and Youyou’s goal was kept safe. Shortly after, Sun launched another uprising in the west. Hu Youcheng secretly assisted him. Iron Leg strode forward, his spirit swallowing mountains and rivers, and reopened the attack. Xi Qiaosheng got the ball and dribbled a few steps, then turned and hooked it. Sun raised his Iron Leg, and with a "bang," the enemy's goal was broken again. The applause from all around was like thunder. It was Sun's masterpiece.</p>
<p>(Enemy Invades) After dozens more attacks, the silver whistle blew, temporarily calling for rest. Sun Iron Leg gave military instructions on the spot, and the athletes received their teachings. As the battle drums roared, the warhorses leaped again. The French Chamber of Commerce came with the ambition to win, but enjoyed a double shutout in the first half, which made them enraged. Marseille especially rounded his eyes, his expression menacing, and commanded his soldiers to launch a large-scale counterattack. Fafan and Bauschut charged left and right, shooting at the goal three times. Liang Guanlian calmly handled the situation, and there were no mistakes. Soon after, Colette was offside in the penalty area, and the ball was able to escape danger.</p>
<p>(Dragon Gate Falls) Remy's strange soldiers suddenly rose up, shouting and killing incessantly. Colette did not stop, and Huang Ruihua, full of courage, intercepted the ball and passed it forward. Bogui set fire in the west, but unfortunately, he was not successful in his campaign, and Garnier blocked his path. Bauschut made a comeback, connecting with Fafan and Jedden to launch an attack on three fronts. In an instant, Fafan let it go, and Jedden scored a goal in the midst of swords and shadows.</p>
<p>(Flying Cavalry Captures City) Since the score had become two to one, the French Chamber of Commerce was not satisfied and still thought of making peace under the city. The inner defense did not leave a single soldier, and all were sent out to besiege Youyou's goal no less than ten times. The two generals, Qian and Wang, met the attack separately. Huang Zhongjian filled in the gaps, his mind as careful as a hair. Twenty-five minutes of stormy waves turned into nothing in the blink of an eye. Huang Ruihua made a high pass, and Sun Jinshun was as fast as a galloping horse. The enemy's two backs were panting and could not catch up. McNally waited for the sentence with wide eyes. In a flash, the ball entered the French Chamber of Commerce's goal again. The fans on all sides praised and sighed. From then on, Youyou had nothing to fear, and victory was in their grasp. In the end, Youyou won three to one.</p>

<h3>Two to One Wins Final</h3>
<p>The Scott Tower Cup replay between Agaal and West Capture, the first game each tied with one goal, was held yesterday at the racecourse. As a result, Agaal won West Capture by two to one and won the right to the final.</p>
<p>▲West Capture scores one in the first half▲ Both sides fought fiercely, paying close attention to both offense and defense. The situation in the first half was average, without much difference. Both goalkeepers made many dangerous saves. Until eight minutes before the end of the first half, Weigensen sent a high ball from twenty yards away from the enemy's goal. Agaal's left forward Tao Que Dou jumped up to head the ball, but missed, and the ball went backward. Jack ran up and kicked it, and the impregnable gate was broken. In the first half, West Capture led by one to zero.</p>
<p>▲Agaal scores successively in the second half▲ In the second half, Agaal launched a full-scale counterattack, making every effort to advance. West Capture faced the sun and the wind, and the ball was passed very close. Agaal's five forwards surrounded the goal. At twenty minutes, the center forward passed to the left, and the left winger Hughes scored, making it a tie. Agaal then retreated, defending for another ten minutes. Getting a chance, they advanced again. Hughes passed to the center, and Cragg hooked the ball with his heel, hitting the net perfectly. Agaal won by two to one. Afterwards, West Capture forced several corner kicks, all to no avail. The second half was all about Agaal.</p>

<h3>Financial Half-Day Gold Market Fluctuates Entirely With Large Traders</h3>
<p>= Strength of Bulls and Bears is Equal =</p>
<p>= Continues to Rise by Two Taels and Four Qian =</p>
<p>(Summary) After the gold market rebounded the day before yesterday, people were optimistic overnight. Yesterday's overseas silver market did fall, with the London large bar shrinking by 0.1875. The British-American exchange rate did not change, while the American-British exchange rate fell by 0.040625. American silver was down by 0.0375, and the forward silver price also fell by more than 0.04. The bank's private telegram shrank by 0.005. The foreign exchange market opened slightly tight, and the gold price opened and immediately rose to 811.5 taels. After a slight rotation, it rose again, because Hengxing entrusted other companies to cover their short positions. However, because speculators Wu and Luo tried hard to sell, it went downstream even after rising to 13 taels, and the foreign exchange market also tended to ease. Yuan Maoyong (acting for Luo) and Qingfayong (acting for Wu) sold several times, so it fell to 0.062 taels. However, the Central Bank came to open up the spot market again, and Hengxing came on the scene and vigorously advanced more than 1,600 bars, and it rose again. At this time, the selling interest had faded, rising to 12 taels. People's mood was not good, because the American silver market was closed on the 8th, and its rise and fall could not be known. Those who profited sold off, and the price fell again, but Hengxing and others recklessly poured in at the 10-tael level, pulling the price up, and closed at 10.01 taels. In summary, there were no special changes in the half-day period. The entry and exit of large traders became the cause of the market price rise and fall. The Guangdong banks entered about 4,000 bars, Wu sold off about 1,000 bars, and Luo released about 2,000 or more. Here is a record of the market situation in half a day.</p>
<p>(Sketch) The opening price was 811.5 taels, a jump of 3.8 taels compared to the previous close. Dadecheng and items came to advance (items opened at 11.8 taels), and it rose to 2.8 taels. Qingfayong Yifeng Yonglai sold, and Pangen sold US dollars for February at 0.625, and then fell to 0.03. Zhifeng Yongheng Yu came on the scene and vigorously advanced, rising to 3 taels. However, the foreign exchange market was still loose. Yuan Maoyong Zhaofeng Chang sold, Sassoon sold US dollars for February at 0.6875, and it eased to 0.0625, falling to within 2 taels. However, the items continued to advance (at this time, Hengxing entrusted people to buy fiercely on the items), and even reached 3 taels. Fuyu Daxing Yonglai sold, and it went down again to within 1 tael. Hengyu Qing continued to deliver bars, rising to outside of 2 taels. After this, the sellers were active, and although the listing was small, the domestic market was hard. Sassoon sold again US exchange in January at 0.6875, and Fuyu Yifeng Yong took the opportunity to sell, thus breaking the 10-tael level and retreating to a half 0.08 tael. Dadecheng turned the bar, and the price was slightly fixed, but the sellers were still powerful. Qingfayong sold again, Sassoon cheaply sold US dollars for February, only doing 0.8125, falling to 0.062 taels. The Central Bank then opened the spot market several times, and people's mood was slightly stable. Hengxing came to advance, rising to outside 7 taels, but Yuan Maoyong happened to sell at this time, and the price was raised and suppressed between Hengxing and Yuan Maoyong. When Yuan Maoyong's selling energy was slightly killed, Hengxing vigorously purchased bars, and Yifeng and Yuan Xin Yong also advanced, thus breaking through the 10-tael mark. The Central Bank continued to absorb spot bids, and various spot numbers came to advance, and the foreign exchange market was also slightly better at 0.875. US dollars in March and bank dollars in February were also needed at 0.025. Returning to 12 taels, Daxing Yong and Items Hengyu repeatedly came to sell, while Hengxing bought from time to time at 10 taels inside and outside, so the price was raised and closed at 810 taels and 0.01 taels. People's mood looked down. The items were auctioned down by 0.01 qian, closing at 10 taels. The maximum in half a day was 813 taels, and the minimum was 0.062 taels, with a rise and fall of 6.8 taels. As a result, it continued to rise by 2.4 taels compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>(Opening the Spot Market) The Central Bank initially waited and watched, and after the gold price fell to 0.062 taels, it began to open the spot market, generally doing about five or six hundred bars within 10 taels, advanced by Hengxing Dadecheng Tongfeng Hengtai Kangrun and others.</p>
<p>(Price Disclosure) American exchange small 0.0375, calculated at 27.25 yuan, with a 24000.00 bid combined gold price of 880 taels, 0.073 qian, and 3 fen. Based on the closing price, about more than 70 taels were pressed, more than 9 taels stronger than the previous close. The registration price for February was 810 taels, and the water replenishment was 808 taels.</p>
<p>(Transactions) Daxing Yong, Yuan Maoyong, Zhaofeng Chang, Qingfayong, Fuyu Tianfeng Yong, Fuchang, etc. all exited, Hengxing Zhifeng Yong, Yifeng Hengyu Hongxing Tongfeng Yong, etc. all entered, Dadecheng Hongli Yifeng Yong, etc. came and went from time to time. Large seller Daxing Yong Qingfayong all exited more than a thousand, Yuan Maoyong had more than two thousand, those who entered Hengxing self-entered one thousand hundreds of bars, entrusted other numbers to enter two or three thousand bars, Zhifeng Yong Hengyu about one thousand bars (mostly acting for Guangdong banks) Yifeng two or three hundred bars. Observing the strength of the long and short sides, they were roughly equal, so it closed at the middle price (13 taels and 0.062 taels). Items first advanced and then exited.</p>
<p>(Cooked Red) Cooked red continued to rise, calculated according to the addition of 8.5 taels. Those at the market were very few, and those who entered were not many either. The general trend was good, because after 8.5 taels yesterday, no sellers were seen.</p>
<p>(Swap) This swap has been approaching, and the long and short positions of each number have been getting less and less. Spot numbers are unwilling to post because the central government has a strong intention to accept. Yesterday, only Yingfen Heng and Hengxing swapped 0.05 bars for January and February 1, with Yingfen Heng posting 0.01 qian, because the central government had not opened the spot market at this time.</p>
<p>(Review) Checking the market situation in the middle of this week, it has changed very violently. However, only three days of business have been calculated for gold trading during the New Year. The market opened on the 5th. Due to the successive rise in silver prices, the bulls sold off and the situation was treacherous, especially in the north. In the end, it broke the 800-tael mark, with a minimum of 794.5 taels. The high rebounded by more than 10 taels, and Saturday was 813 taels, for a total difference of 18.5 taels, a drop of 16.1 taels compared to the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Tightens Then Eases</h3>
<p>= Sassoon Sells Vigorously, Gold Industry Also Stalls =</p>
<p>= Listed Prices All Changed Higher =</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market tightened as the large silver bar shrank, and it immediately tightened when it opened.

It eased after entering, because Zhang Sassoon Foreign Firm sold vigorously and the gold industry also stalled. There were not many transactions, and finally it tended to be flat with the gold price. The listed British exchange shrank by 0.0025 and the American exchange fell by 0.00375. However, the gold market was falling at this time, and the domestic market was also hard. As a result, the British exchange was roughly flat compared to the previous close, and the American exchange was tight by 0.000625.

<h3>Weekend Silver Dollar Market Routinely Weak</h3>
<p>In the financial industry during the New Year, there is usually no development. Shanghai habits end the lunar calendar. It is impossible to expand the silver dollar business for a while. Foreign banks, especially the New Year, have few major transactions. On the Chinese bank side, the collections are also not strained. Although money houses sorting out closing procedures do not feel lonely, the abundant capital and surplus of silver are the root cause of the market's ills, let alone business operations. However, yesterday's collections were still weak. Even on weekends, it was not noticeably less. The swap market mostly went downstream.</p>
<p>(Foreign Li Gradually Decreases, Silver Swaps Remain Flat and Listless) The "foreign li" was weak yesterday morning, and the price plummeted when the market opened. The closing price was smaller by 0.001 than the previous day's afternoon market, at 0.07135. The afternoon market was slightly calmer, slightly higher than the early morning market by 0.000125, at 0.0713625. Based on the general trend, this market can get by during the lunar New Year. The "silver swap" in both the morning and afternoon markets was still 0.02, with a floating head plus water initially at 0.023, but then remained flat. The sluggishness of the silver capital situation is indescribable.</p>
<p>(Jiangguang Fell Early and Rose in the Afternoon, Copper Coins Continue to Shorten) The South minor foreign fell in the early morning, smaller by 0.005 than the previous day, calculated at 0.063, while the afternoon market rose again, calculated to have risen by 0.002, at 0.0632. There were 5,000 jiao of transactions made in the early morning market and 3,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong minor foreign also fell early and rose in the afternoon, with the early morning market at 0.06175 and the afternoon market at 0.06185. As a result, it was slightly better by 0.0005 than the previous day's afternoon market. There were 65,000 jiao of transactions in the early morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The copper coin returned and shrank by 1,000 wen, to 391,000 wen. There were also few transactions, only more than 37,000 strings of wen.</p>
<p>(Foreign Exchange and Silver Markets Both Relaxed, Silver Collections Were Scattered) For "foreign loans," yesterday morning's exchange drafts only made 475,000 in the early market, and even less in the afternoon market, only 415,000. Banknotes were 35,000 in the early market and 45,000 in the afternoon market. Off-market banknotes were 60,000 in the early market and 75,000 in the afternoon market. Bank branch trades were 125,000 in the early market and 25,000 in the afternoon market. The interbank intermarket was 400,000 in the early market and 350,000 in the afternoon market. The receipt and payment of foreign accounts by each bank was 1,780,000, and the receipt and issuance of banknotes was 1,700,000. There was no news of customer route expenses, the money houses' foreign public single receipts and payments were 9,100,000, foreign remittance expenses receipts and payments were 2,220,000, swap foreign loan inflows and outflows were 2,440,000, small money houses' transactions were 800,000, and foreign mortgages were borrowed for 330,000. For "silver loans," yesterday's bank collections, although it was Saturday (the number was smaller), the scattered collections were still trivial and complicated. Foreign merchant receipts and payments for drafts were 1,770,000, Chinese merchant receipts and payments for drafts were 1,990,000, advances were 2,340,000, settlements were 3,000,000, special loans were 3,330,000, and various goods, remittances, taxes and miscellaneous expenses were collected and paid out by foreign merchants for 2,890,000 and by Chinese merchants for 4,340,000, mortgage transactions were 780,000, foreign merchants released 600,000 from warehouses, Chinese merchants entered 400,000 into warehouses, money houses' silver public single receipts and payments were 26,600,000, remittance expenses receipts and payments were 3,880,000, remittances to various routes receipts and payments were 550,000, and cash receipts were 230,000.</p>
<h3>Deposit Interest Opened at Two Taels</h3>
<p>At the regular meeting of the Money Industry Association the day before yesterday, it was resolved that the standard for deposit interest in December would still be calculated at the lowest rate of 0.0295 stipulated. According to the statistics of the silver swap in February, it was less than 0.01, which was the smallest statistical amount in the market, so it was resolved to use the stipulated low rate as the rate. As for overdue interest, it would be added according to the bottom rate of 0.045, so the highest overdue interest would still be no more than 0.1005.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Continue to Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 7th), the transaction situation of various bonds on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was as follows: the spot market was extremely clear, only opening up salt tax 19 Customs, and the futures market was still active. Important bonds came and went without being deserted, and the market sentiment remained weak. When it opened, it continued to fall across the board. Although there were no major changes afterwards, the trend remained very weak and there was no slight turning point. As a result, 15 Customs bonds for next month and 19 customs bonds for January each fell by more than 2 yuan, and others also fell by about 1.5 yuan. Only the Customs and Compilation bonds fell by only a few 0.06 or 0.07 yuan. The situation is still difficult to be optimistic, but the situation will no longer change, and there may be a temporary reaction. It is estimated that the futures trading in the morning was more than 4,550,000, and the after-market was 5,520,000, totaling 9,815,000 yuan. Spot trading totaled only 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower Brand Yarn Flower Under Heavy Pressure from the Current Situation</h3>
<p>(Yarn) The market is generally sluggish, with a slightly soft trend. Due to the still serious military situation in the Northeast, people are panicked and there are fewer buyers. Some believe that foreign yarn prices are high and raw cotton is firm, so the desire to pull in goods remains strong. Actual sales in southern ports are still active.</p>
<p>(Human Standard Gradually Loosening) The opening market for Human Standard was initially firm, but by the second and third rounds, due to the unfavorable situation and relaxed sentiment, prices for various months fell by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 cash. The afternoon market was flat, with prices for various months falling again by 1, 2, 5, and 8 cash. Total transactions for the day were 21,600 bales. Sales included 2,700 bales of Jifeng, 1,150 bales of Yuantai, 650 bales of Mingde, and 800 bales of Changfeng. Purchases included 1,900 bales of Xincheng, 1,050 bales of Dachang, 1,250 bales of Yichang, 450 bales of Yuanda, and 500 bales of Gengfeng. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Anqing 20 Changsha 250 Xiamen 55 Nanyang 25 Fellow Traders 70</p>
<p>(Cotton) The market has turned sluggish due to the calm in foreign cotton and the continued tense situation. The yarn market is soft, leading to relaxed sentiment. In the afternoon, Jifeng bulls liquidated heavily. A manufacturer's coarse velvet cotton, prepared for delivery this month, is abundant. General scattered long positions reappear without restraint. The market trend for this month is increasingly weak, and distant months are dragged down. According to the Yarn Exchange, the discount for substitute standard product 10-count Shandong coarse velvet is 4 liang and 5 qian.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Jifeng Bulls Liquidate) The Zheng Standard market opened firmly in the morning, supported by stable Indian and American cotton markets. By the second and third rounds, it weakened slightly, with prices for various months falling by 5 fen to 1 qian. In the afternoon, some bulls liquidated, causing a sudden drop in the market, with prices for various months falling by 1 to 2 qian. Total transactions for the day were 77,700 dan.

<h3>Foreign Cotton Dull and Lifeless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to selling pressure, then tightened due to foreign buying, and finally softened again due to southern hedging. Futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 4 points. Spot prices were unchanged. English cotton futures fell by 1 point, spot prices were unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 4 points. Indian cotton was firm due to short covering and speculative buying. Pingguoer rose by 2 rupees, Aomulian rose by 1.75 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 1.25 rupees.

<h3>American Cotton Focus Still on Rural Relief Bill</h3>
<p>New York, January 6th telegram reports on the week's cotton market: Raw cotton prices this week recovered slightly due to purchases by industry participants and short covering, but southern sales also followed suit. The mid-week rally coincided with the revival of talk that Washington might pass an inflation plan, but there has been no substantial progress on this matter to date. The rural relief bill is the focus of attention for many, but it has had no significant impact on the cotton market here, as even if the bill is passed by the House, it will face even greater opposition in the Senate. Without a final disposition of this bill, people will be at a loss and uncertain, creating unrest and hindering the crystallization of opinions regarding the acreage of rice and cotton fields. According to the American Cotton Production News Agency, preliminary survey data indicates that planting intentions have not changed much. At the same time, reduced fertilizer application, signs of insect activity, and the decline in cotton farmers' enthusiasm all suggest that, under average weather conditions, yields per acre may decrease. Weekend statistics are listed below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Grain, Thin Rice, and Baozi Sales Remain Healthy</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, 50 to 60 boats arrived in the South City. Urban and rural stores still have good appetite. Sales of baozi shops continue. An estimated 20 boats of Kaitong late rice were sold at the dock, approximately 2,000 shi of rice. As a result, the price of late rice continued to rise by half a yuan. Su-Tong japonica rice is in good shape because arrivals and sales are balanced. Due to the change from yin to yuan, appetite has become active and the price has also increased by 1 to 2 chi.</p>
<p>(Zhabei) Yesterday, 40 to 50 boats arrived downriver. Sales of high-quality goods in stores were balanced. Secondary and inferior goods continued to be sold. Stockholders continued to buy mid-grade goods. The market for high-quality goods has stabilized. Secondary and inferior goods have slightly increased in price. Arrivals of rice are not strong. Tianjin baozi appetite remains healthy, and retail sales are also substantial, so prices remain tight. Early rice is strong. Du Yangxian rice arrivals and sales are balanced, and the market has stabilized. Port tips are also showing a steady trend. Arrivals of Yin Yuan are small, and sales are active, so prices are showing strength. The market for Bai Yuan is neither good nor bad.</p>
<p>Another batch of Hunan Xian Yuan continues to arrive.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice and Raw Peanuts, Shanghai Stocks 330,000 Bags and 200,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, another batch of guest Xian rice continued to arrive from Hunan Province, including 1,700 bags of machine oil Jing and over 500 bags of machine Yuan. Dealers are mostly hoping for good prices. Because Minhua has not been selling well recently, they still dare not offer samples, relying on this to wait for opportunities. The Fujian gang has a strong purchasing interest, but because of the recent sale of river rice, the locking of guest Xian has turned dull. The quality of guest Yuan rice is better, and there is still social demand. However, because there are currently too many arrivals, shippers mostly want to sell quickly, so Yuan rice continues to soften. Yesterday, the Quanzhou gang bought 130 bags of newly arrived Hunan machine Yuan from the previous day at a price of 9 yuan and 4 jiao, which were high-quality long-grain rice. There are still 330,000 bags of foreign rice in Shanghai, mostly in the hands of British merchants Anli Xiangmao, etc. There is very little floating stock in the market. There is quite a demand on this street, but because the shippers are holding on to it, no sales have been made yet.</p>
<p>Yellow soybeans appetite is not strong, with a total of over a thousand bags traded. The market shape is difficult to determine for the time being. The Ningbo and Xiamen gangs also sold 240 bags of sesame, and the market is temporarily looking flat. Green beans are still stable. It is rumored that there are 200,000 dan of raw peanuts in Shanghai, and sales are sluggish. The market is feared to weaken. The oil market has a stabilizing trend.</p>
<h3>Flour Rises Sharply by Three Cents This Month</h3>
<p>△Due to the sharp rise in foreign wheat and the shortage of flour in Tianjin△</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was consistently strong in the morning. Foreign wheat rose by about 5 to 6 jiao. In addition, there is a current shortage of flour in Tianjin, and people are urgently purchasing. The spot goods of the troop transport ship have been completely purchased. Currently, the factory market for February is being bid for at two liang. Prices were seen to rise immediately at the opening. The Tianjin gang is still continuing to buy heavily in the near term. The forward market is being boosted by the rising price of foreign wheat. In the afternoon, the opening was still good. The market sentiment is unanimously looking for higher prices. The current price of foreign wheat is also more expensive than in previous years. No. 2 Kan wheat is being shouted for at four liang, although there have been no transactions, people's hearts are shocked by it. As a result, this month's price rose sharply by another three cents compared to the previous month. February and March rose by two and a half cents. April rose by four cents and two and a half li. May rose by three cents and seven and a half li. June rose by three and a half cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Jump Eight or Nine Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a consistent rising trend. Because there are very few spot goods for this month, there are only buyers and no sellers. Therefore, the market only has buyers raising prices, and those with actual goods are not releasing them for hedging. As a result, prices are rising unusually quickly. The price of foreign wheat has increased in the forward market. Australian wheat ordered before the new year was only three liang, five qian, five or six fen, but now it must be three liang and seven qian or more. Kan wheat has risen even faster, with No. 2 being raised to four liang, so people's hearts are also seen to be excited. Although there are few transactions, the price increase is also surprisingly high. Observing this situation, it is completely overshadowed by the impact of the war. How it will move forward is difficult to predict. As a result, this month rose by eight cents, February rose by five cents, March rose by seven cents, and April rose by nine cents. The rest are comparable. There are currently 300 bags, which have been purchased by the factories. The market is extremely firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Chaoqing Number Plate Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market did not have any shipments due to it being a Sunday today. The market price moved very little. The association's marked price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was fifteen liang and nine and a half qian, with a few transactions. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was fifteen liang and four qian, No. 18 was fifteen liang and two qian, Dutch red No. 8 was twelve liang and three or four qian, No. 9 was twelve liang and a half, and No. 10 was twelve liang and six and a half qian. Chaoqing continued to open about 400 bags yesterday, with the top grade at eight liang and eight qian, and the next grade lower. The number of godown stocks is already low, and the cost of future goods is difficult to calculate, so the trend is expected to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Zhilu Goods, More Strong Than Weak, in North-South Goods</h3>
<p>There was not much change in North-South goods during the holiday period. However, the price of golden needle vegetables has become cheap, the number of godown goods has tightened, and the intention to import is stronger. The price of ordinary wood ear fungus has also risen to fifty-two or three liang. Longkou vermicelli has been arriving frequently, but has recently rebounded slightly due to strong sales. Hunan lotus seeds have been rising in price due to the thinness of the stock and the firm holding of godown stocks. High-quality goods have reached fifty-eight liang, with a trend approaching sixty liang. Inferior goods range up to fifty-three liang. Locust rice is in short supply, and high-quality goods have risen to five liang and six or seven qian. Black wolfberries have also shown improvement. Longan godown prices are stable, and godown prices are slightly tight. Jinshan branch godown goods are firm and are unwilling to be sold cheaply. Lanzhu branches are flat, weak, and lack sales.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Factories, Jingchou Sales Are Not Lonely</p>
<h3>丨Shandong Da Er Wan Shou, More Than 500 Pieces Shipped to England丨</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in foreign banks in this port still did not improve. Since the end of the year, there has been no new development in silk sales in European and American markets. Except for a few European banks in Shanghai that are making up for short-covering trades, actual sales are still in a wait-and-see mode. However, users of silk doors in inland areas have been increasing their appetite for yellow and white factory Jingchou, and transactions are not lonely.</p>
<p>Since the discovery of new sales channels in England for Shandong Da Er Wan Shou last spring, hundreds of pieces have been shipped to England every month. This time, the British mail ship Sutton is exporting, and Xiangmao and others have another 570 pieces of Shandong Wan Shou being shipped to England.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea Transactions Continue to Be Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhenmei green tea from the road godowns continued to be purchased in large quantities by British banks such as Yihe Jinlong. Total citywide transactions reached over 3,000 boxes. The current tea price has reached its peak. Spring sales in the Moroccan market have also resumed activity. In recent days, telegrams of foreign demand are still pouring in. There is a prospect of continued development in market demand. Gongxi's Russian sales are also active, but the price is even cheaper than before.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Overseas Tinplate Sees Another Price Increase</h3>
<p>London telegram, yesterday, 90-pound tinplate was at 16 shillings and 6 pence, and 100-pound was at 17 shillings and 2 pence, both up 3 pence from before. There were very few transactions. There are currently no goods for company iron futures, and goods will not be available until April and May, with a price of 14 and a half pounds per ton. It is heard that industry colleagues in this port have bought 20 to 30 tons. New York telegram, antimony rose 125 to 5.50 per pound.</p>
<h3>Tea Gang Buys Over a Thousand Pieces of Qing Lead</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Yuguan, purchases of hardware by North Road guest gangs have greatly decreased. Business on Changjiang Road and Nanlu Road is also very depressed. The business of construction gangs and factories on this street is also small, so the market situation is quite quiet. However, tea godowns are very active in buying Qing lead, with a total of 1,300 to 1,400 pieces purchased (half of which are for delivery in February). The market price has increased considerably for a time and is currently at twelve liang and seven and a half qian, an increase of more than three or four qian from before. However, exchange rates have recently become expensive again, and it is feared that the standard will have to rise again. As for Hunan lead, arrivals are plentiful but sales are slightly lower, and the market remains normal. It is estimated to be at twelve liang.</p>
<p>After the Re-establishment of Sino-Russian Relations, the Vladivostok Gang Buys Large Quantities of Hardware</p>
<h3>丨Tianjin Telegrams Stopped丨</h3>
<p>Since the opening of customs, there has been no large business in hardware transactions. However, after the re-establishment of Sino-Russian relations, the Vladivostok gang is buying large quantities of metal products, totaling several thousand dan, including over seven hundred boxes of tinplate. The market price has been driven up by this, so it has reached twelve liang. There have also been several hundred dan of new lead wire, plain galvanized iron, and black iron sheet traded, with the prices of new lead wire and plain galvanized iron rising by two and a half qian. If there is no large influx of black iron sheet, there is also some business in white iron pipes, angle iron, new foreign silver dollars, etc., but not much. Due to Japanese troops invading the territory, the Tianjin and other gangs have stopped sending telegrams. As for the Yangtze River, Yantai, Fujian, and Guangdong gangs, there have also been no large transactions. In the past week, in addition to Qichang, Xintai Guogong and Xianghe godowns having slightly shipped new iron products, there is no news of arrivals from other agents.</p>

<h3>Three Sleepless Nights</h3>
<p>— Li Yun</p>
<p>I haven’t had a good night’s sleep for three consecutive nights, all thanks to my neighbors. The first night, after nine o’clock, they started playing mahjong. Besides the couple, there were two men’s voices, probably their friends. The tiles hitting the table sounded so crisp! It turned out they hadn’t even put a thin cloth on the table. Besides the sound of the tiles, there were occasional bursts of shouting. Indeed, playing mahjong is energizing. They were so full of vigor; the sound of the tiles on the table became louder and louder: crack, crack, smack! That’s what you call playing mahjong! It seemed like two of them were playing with all their might. If someone won a big hand, then the person sleeping next door was really out of luck. That burst of noise would wake you up even if you were sound asleep. This went on until two o’clock, and I could still hear someone resentfully shouting: "Four more rounds..."</p>
<p>The second night, late at night, the doorbell rang, and the husband came home. Not long after, his wife started arguing with him. The voice was angry and indistinct, but I could hear things like, "Shameless hussy, that dirty slut..." and the husband’s angry and malicious voice: "You're the slut! What business is it of yours? Humph..." Then, clang! I don’t know who smashed a teacup! No, maybe it was a rice bowl; who knows. Something heavy fell over, and it seemed like they were wrestling. Then it sounded like someone came to break them up. But after that, there were more curses and sobs, sometimes loud, sometimes soft. I don’t know how long it went on.</p>
<p>The third night, it seemed that the couple was not at home. Their son, who was studying at some university, had just come back from school. He was probably waiting for his parents because he turned on the phonograph. What was it? Some kind of recording. Oh, he was singing along! A woman’s voice! It really made my hair stand on end. From another room came the sound of a harmonium. That was his little sister; she was also inspired to sing. She was straining her throat to sing an outdated song called "Poor Qiu Xiang." They were each enjoying themselves, singing an out-of-tune ensemble. How lively! Shattering the neighbors' sweet dreams, what did that matter!</p>
<p>These three consecutive nights have given me so much unease and irritation.</p>
<h3>Seize the Present!</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Worldwide economic panic, bank failures, stock market crashes, factory shutdowns, tens of millions unemployed! Imperialists around the world desperately preparing for war, armories working day and night, deadly weapons piled up like mountains, newly invented poison gas numbering in the hundreds if not thousands! The world's "scholars" can no longer cover up the lies burned through, bitterly crying: civilization bankrupt!</p>
<p>Ah, ah, our world has reached an unprecedented era of transformation in human history!</p>
<p>Economic destruction across China, foreign goods like poisonous blood penetrating the veins of the countryside. Even in a so-called year of abundance, farmers have no food to eat! Rural unrest all over China, money running to safe havens, causing a deformed development of the urban economy, creating urban luxury, decadence, sin, rouge lips, jade legs, starry eyes, roulette, liquor, opium! All of China groaning and struggling under the iron heel of imperialism, deceived by Han traitors and national scum! China's "gentlemen" shake their heads and sigh: people's hearts are not as good as they used to be; the times are difficult.</p>
<p>Ah, ah, our China has also reached an unprecedented era of suffering in history! Yet it is also an era of transformation.</p>
<p>Dark and chaotic modern times! The fragile souls of petty citizens cannot bear this suffering of the "present"! They want to escape reality, they look up at the sky - the sky entrusted to God or the gods, they pin their hopes of consolation on the vague future! They look back - at the glorious past of the divine warriors, using it to deceive themselves!</p>
<p>The future, the future! This is expressed in the Kalachakra Tantra Assembly and in the ten or twenty years of "long-term resistance" enduring hardship with firm resolve!</p>
<p>The past, the past! This is expressed in the admiration for the "national hero" Yue Fei, the worship of Qi Jiguang, somewhere there are killers defending against Japanese pirates, somewhere there are platforms resisting Japanese pirates!... Our few literary giants count these "family treasures" backwards, unable to finish counting even after three days and three nights!</p>
<p>But what about the "present"?</p>
<p>The answer is silence, silence, a third silence!</p>
<p>But others are tightly seizing this "present," sharpening their swords and preparing their horses, invading and invading again!</p>
<p>Bah! Born in this era of worldwide transformation and China's suffering! Do not be obsessed with the past! Empty fantasies of the future! The past is already past; the future is only the future! Let us shout: -</p>
<p>Seize the Present!</p>
<h3>Shen Congwen on Marriage</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Shen Congwen's novels are often praised for their mature writing and humorous language, but few know that this gentleman's letters are full of jokes and quite laughable. I remember in the summer of 1930, he was escaping the summer heat in Wusong and sent me a letter discussing marriage, saying:</p>
<p>"Because I am an old man myself, when I see young people with wives, even if they are not yet qualified to get married, I advise them to take the risk. (There's also the joke that I've been a matchmaker three times.) So I advise you to work hard at writing and also advise you to take the risk of getting married. Compared to women, career is nothing. People are only admirable when they are young, everything else is empty. But if you are young and spend your days in self-satisfaction, not knowing how to live well, then that young person is not worth mentioning. Love women, love friends, love life, do it well! Once you get older, it's all over. Women are only valuable when they are young. Letting young women grow old in the air is the sin of men."</p>
<p>Later, Ziyu and Luohong got married in Shanghai. Congwen happened to be in Qingdao and could not attend. On the auspicious day, I received a letter from Congwen and showed it to Hong. We recited it together. I told him about the previous letter, and we both smiled. Because he had encouraged marriage, he was now seeing Ziyu’s invitation. The letter said:</p>
<p>"Congratulations to you, the new groom, may you have a good life in the future. If you had sent me an invitation, I would have prepared a share of wedding wine. I really hope you will save my share, and I will drink it when I come to Shanghai in June to see your new home. The day of the wedding must be very lively. It's very different. I can’t see the demeanor of the groom. A couple of years ago, when Zhao Jingshen was the groom, it was very interesting. The fat man put on a formal suit rented from some shop. Many people were running around looking for a button or a belt. The groom just put his hand in a pocket on his waistband, wiping the sweat from his face, and kept tilting his head to one side, as if the stiff collar was tormenting his chin. After a while, firecrackers went off outside, darts were thrown, Western horns and Western drums were played, but I don't know who forced him to praise his wife with two sentences like writing poetry in the hall. He still remembered some moving words from his lotus leaf, and quoted a few sentences from Zhou Zuoren. Afterwards, it was naturally time to play music and drink. After seeing it once, I still think it's more vivid and interesting than his novels. Thinking of your wedding from that story must also be very happy.</p>
<p>Are you planning to live in Shanghai in the future or still go to Suzhou? If you two have the means, taking a trip to Beijing in this spring full of flowers would not be a meaningless trip. People say that in Qingdao during the honeymoon, the husband can be gentler, and the wife can be happier. You are such young and happy people. If you come to Qingdao, I am afraid you will be envied by the heavens and given rain, fog, and wind every day. This place in Qingdao knows that many young people get married in the spring and do not forget that Qingdao is very close to everywhere, and the place is quiet. Someone must be preparing to come and play, so the climate is always excellent. Only this spring, a large number of days have been almost terrible. Summer here is a good time to play. The various colors of the sea and the sky are indescribable, making people very peaceful.</p>
<p>I hope you will say hello to your wife for me. May God bless you and may you always have smiling faces in your life."</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of the Era and Love, Part 34</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>These were the first words Auntie Zhuo said after sitting down. Her smile seemed to carry a hint of cunning. Haiquan intuitively felt that this old woman was not easy to get close to. To put it bluntly, she was a woman whose intellect was too developed and not very understanding of human emotions.</p>
<p>After talking for a while, Haiquan learned that Zhuo Shuhua's elder brother, Shunxing, used to be a clerk in the ○○ bureau, but recently he was dismissed by the newly appointed bureau chief. However, he was reluctant to give up this job. He inquired and searched everywhere, and eventually found out that the new bureau chief was an old classmate of Ren Jinhua, and several people recommended by Ren Jinhua had been placed by the new bureau chief. Last week, he heard his sister mention that her classmate Lin Haiquan was Ren Jinhua's brother-in-law, so he asked his sister to pursue this path for him. "It's just a small job with thirty dollars a month. I think with a letter from Mr. Ren to the new bureau chief, I can definitely be reinstated."</p>
<p>Zhuo Shunxing explained earnestly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, can you help us out?"</p>
<p>Zhuo Shuhua blushed and gave Haiquan a charming smile.</p>
<p>"I can see him on the fifth night..."</p>
<p>"Then that would be great."</p>
<p>Shunxing said with a smile, and it looked like he was about to applaud several times. Haiquan thought, it's just a small job with thirty dollars, and they're scrambling so hard for it. Tonight, he himself is like an important person. So, he became a little proud.</p>
<p>"Then please ask Mr. Lin to speak to Mr. Ren and ask him to write a letter to the new bureau chief, okay?"</p>
<p>Zhuo Shuhua wanted to push this matter onto Haiquan's shoulders. "But..."</p>
<p>He was still a little hesitant because he really wasn't sure.</p>
<p>"Please, Mr. Lin! For my sake!"</p>
<p>Zhuo Shuhua said, pointing to her face and smiling. Seeing her innocent expression, Haiquan couldn't bear to refuse. "Okay. I'll try to say something for you. I can't guarantee whether it will succeed or not."</p>
<p>"As long as Mr. Lin agrees, it's bound to succeed!"</p>
<p>Auntie Zhuo added more encouragement from the side.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the telephone rang, "Chilin, Chilin." Auntie Zhuo quickly spread her legs wide and walked over to answer the phone, holding the receiver to her ear. Haiquan saw her back view, which looked even more bloated and ugly.</p>
<p>"Okay... I know... That number... How can that work?... Tell him to go back!... Okay, okay... No, no. Okay, okay. That's what I mean..."</p>
<p>The old woman was listening to the phone while looking at Haiquan. Her expression seemed embarrassed, as if she was afraid of him overhearing something secret.</p>
<p>Auntie Zhuo put down the receiver and returned to sit at the square table.</p>
<p>"Who was that calling?"</p>
<p>Haiquan asked unconsciously.</p>
<p>"She was,..."</p>
<p>At that moment, Haiquan saw Shuhua quickly wink at her mother, and Auntie Zhuo changed her tone.</p>
<p>"Someone from the Moonlight Association was calling."</p>
<p>"It wasn't someone from Elder Sister calling!"</p>

<h3>Reviewing the Past, Encouraging the Future</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>(Last year, the three provinces were occupied; last year, Jinzhou fell; this year, Yuguan was lost; I don't know what will happen next year on this day?)</p>
<p>The alarm bell of "National Extinction! National Extinction!" has been ringing in China for more than fifty years, so most people hear the words "national extinction" as if it were a mantra to persuade people to do good deeds. Although the number of poor people in the country, the number of people without food, is increasing day by day, and the scope of the area where people are fighting for food - the bandit area - is expanding day by day, the entire political and social order is becoming more and more lax and chaotic. But most of the people who have more food to eat, who live in quieter places, especially the people in Shanghai, which is known as the ten-mile foreign concession, have a live-and-let-live mentality. "National extinction"? It's just talk; we ordinary people can't manage so much. People who have a better understanding of the international situation are even more eloquent in singing the grand truth that China will not perish under the balance of power in the international community. Therefore, the term "national extinction! national extinction!" has gradually diminished its serious meaning in the minds of Chinese people.</p>
<p>Like a bolt from the blue, on September 18th of the year before last, Shenyang City, Liaoning, was occupied by the Japanese army, and the key cities of the three provinces continued to be occupied. Following this, Jinzhou fell on January 2nd of last year, shocking the whole country. But in the midst of this shocking wave, apart from the compatriots in the three northeastern provinces who immediately felt the great disaster of national extinction descending, most people still felt that the League of Nations and the great powers would not stand idly by. As long as we argued on the basis of reason and at the same time did our best to help the volunteer army and strictly boycotted Japanese goods, we could achieve the final victory. To go even deeper, the important purpose of Japan's move was nothing more than protecting the rights it had already gained in the three northeastern provinces, or it had no ambition to occupy them for a long time, and so on. Unexpectedly, just when our whole country, from the government to the people, was panicking, hoping for luck and hesitating, the Japanese army, according to their well-thought-out plan, began to attempt to occupy the area around Shanghai within 24 hours. This shocked us, and all previous predictions were overturned. The danger of "national extinction," which we thought would not happen, immediately re-emerged in the minds of the Chinese people. Therefore, the brave resistance of the 19th Route Army won the support of the whole country. Especially the people living in Shanghai, which had always felt the safest, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Zhenru, and Nanxiang all directly suffered huge sacrifices. Even Nanjing was threatened by shelling. The government moved the capital, and Hangzhou and Suzhou, which were considered paradises by the whole country, were visited several times by Japanese planes. Nanshi also spent more than thirty days in the fear of not knowing what the next day would bring. Even the people in the safest concession heard the sound of artillery every day and were terrified. At that time, we could see that the patriotic enthusiasm and the fear of national extinction of the people across the country had reached the highest level. Everyone felt the past carelessness and lack of preparation, especially the resentment against the government's lack of assertiveness and resistance - factional struggles, internal strife, selfishness, and corruption - which led to empty national defense and no way to resist the enemy. At the same time, everyone made a great determination, believing that the people and the government of the whole country should start from this day to correct their past mistakes and work together to do the work of national salvation by recuperating and training.</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army eventually retreated due to lack of support. The Japanese army, also due to the lesson of resistance, established the so-called Shanghai Agreement in understanding with the United Kingdom and France. Two weeks after the Shanghai battle stopped (March 14), the League of Nations investigation team came to China, putting on a show of visiting, investigating, and conducting on-the-spot inspections from Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, and Beijing all the way to the three northeastern provinces, and then returned to Beijing to write a report. On September 5, this once-sensational investigation team announced its departure from Shanghai. We observed the psychology of the whole country at that time, which was really wavering to the extreme. Before the Shanghai battle stopped, there were various resolutions to repent of the past and prepare for the future, but once the battle stopped, the investigation team arrived in Shanghai, and the agreement was signed, and traffic was restored, everyone's courage, determination, and fear disappeared with the restoration of the temporary peace, placing all their hopes on the investigation team. The people were like this, and the government was also like this. After the investigation team left the country, everyone hoped for the publication of the report, and after the report was published, they hoped that the League of Nations could strictly implement it. But during this period of hoping and relying on the League of Nations investigation team, what was the situation in our whole country? On the people's side, even the minimum boycott movement and the supply of the volunteer army outside the customs could not be thoroughly implemented, and active assistance was not provided. On the government's side, the central government concentrated all its efforts on suppressing bandits, and the internal affairs of the provinces were fighting with each other. After the investigation team left Shanghai, there was the Chen brothers' dispute in Guangdong, followed by the war between Han and Liu in Shandong, and then the suicide in Sichuan and the turmoil in Guizhou. When the war in Sichuan was at its fiercest, the League of Nations met, and all the resolutions gave us a "disappointment." The cry that the League of Nations was unreliable filled the whole country again, and at the same time, news of the Japanese army preparing to invade Rehe was heard from time to time. At this time, we do not know how the government was preparing, and the people were even more powerless. So, although we realized that the League of Nations was unreliable and knew that the Japanese army was planning to attack Rehe again, there was nothing we could do. Everyone had the mentality of waiting until after the New Year. Who knew that the Japanese soldiers did not pay much attention to the custom of celebrating the New Year and started attacking Yuguan on New Year's Day. The troops stationed there resisted for two days, and then retreated due to lack of support, so Yuguan fell on the afternoon of the third day at 2 p.m. Now Beijing and Tianjin are under great threat, and eight Japanese warships are stationed in Nanjing. The whole country is shaken again. The repentance and determination at the time of the Shanghai battle have been launched again, but what will we do?</p>
<p>Looking at the facts of the past, the shortcomings of our entire national character can be said to have been completely exposed. Our remedy now, which can be said to be the only way to save the country, is to have the following recognitions and resolutions from this day forward:</p>
<p>(1) If we do not make the greatest efforts and struggles, then in the near future, we will either become slaves of Japan or become international subjects. (2) It is always easier to remedy before the country is destroyed than to do it after the country is destroyed. (3) We must prepare in advance; it will be too late when the enemy is in front of us. (4) We should each start with ourselves, deeply repent, and strive for self-renewal. We should not blame others for following the old ways and living in peace. We should reflect on ourselves and strive to improve ourselves. We should first establish our personal will and then plan to gather like-minded people to fight together. We believe that as long as the majority of the country can do this, China will not be destroyed.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Resolving Labor-Management Disputes</h3>
<p>— Ruan Guoyi</p>
<p>(Labor-management dispute issues)</p>
<p>In recent years, labor-management disputes have occurred almost every month. The reason is nothing more than the labor side not understanding the difficulties of the capital side, and the capital side not sympathizing with the suffering of the labor side, which has led to this unfortunate phenomenon. The labor side first makes demands, and then uses strikes as blackmail; the capital side first refuses to accept the conditions, and then uses dismissal as oppression, and ultimately both sides are injured and gain nothing. The capital side loses business income, and the labor side experiences mental pain. Even if one side wins, the feelings between labor and capital have been completely wiped out. Therefore, the capital side will increase the workload of the labor side to compensate for the extra expenses, and the labor side will never be willing to increase the efficiency of their work because of the victory. As a result, labor-management disputes start again. If this cycle continues for a long time, the capital side will inevitably stop starting businesses, the labor side will experience the fear of unemployment, and the entire society will become uneasy. Therefore, how to resolve labor-management disputes is a very important issue at present. As for the solution, it is necessary to combine the spirit of labor and capital into one body so that each has a personal stake in the matter. My suggestion is:</p>
<p>For example, if there is a factory with a capital of 10,000 shares, each share worth ten silver yuan, and there are 100 workers, each with a salary of twenty yuan; we should reserve 1,000 shares or 500 shares as worker benefit shares, and then deduct five percent of each worker's salary. To the extent possible, the capital side should provide a subsidy or "compassionate payment" equal to five percent of the salary and deposit it on their behalf each month. When it reaches ten yuan, a worker benefit share should be issued. This share should enjoy the same rights as other shares. In this way, a worker with a monthly salary of twenty yuan will have two shares of profit distribution in a year, and after ten years, he will have twenty shares of profit income. As the factory develops day by day, his profits will also increase day by day. Thinking of the increase in his own profits, he will definitely work hard to increase the efficiency of his work in order to ensure the factory's development and receive a large share of the dividends. This is just a small favor for the capital side, not only without loss, but also with unexpected progress; and on the labor side, in addition to gratitude, they will inevitably work even harder to maintain their interests because of their close relationship with the factory. If both labor and capital can always work together in this way, the result will be that not only will small capital become large capital, but workers will also become petty bourgeois elements. In this way, if there are labor-management disputes again, I will never believe it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a dismissed worker does not want to keep these shares, or needs the money for use, the capital side can also stipulate in advance that they can buy back his shares at 80% or 75% of their value. If a retired worker wants to keep his shares, he is free to do so. In short, as long as he has one share, the factory cannot cancel his status as a shareholder.</p>
<p>When the labor side has stable jobs, the capital side will have the spirit of starting businesses; when factories stand like forests, the unemployed masses will naturally gradually decrease, and the precarious Chinese industry and commerce may still have hope of being saved because of this!</p>

<h3>The Sorrow of a Traveling Salesman</h3>
<p>— Shi Sheng</p>
<p>(The Life of a Printing Employee)</p>
<p>"In the beginning, you're just 'following the salesman,' all you have to do is follow the traveling salesman around every day, all the time; then you've fulfilled your responsibility. Now you're a traveling salesman, you not only have to travel, but also bring in business. Bringing in business isn't enough, you also have to collect the money, otherwise, humph! The manager won't be happy with you." That was the lecture that Mr. Luo from our Shunxing Printing Shop gave me when I went from "following the salesman" to being a traveling salesman. At first, I was so scared I was sweating; this thing had the flavor of a pheasant soliciting customers. But at least the pheasant uses beautiful calling cards to solicit, enticing young gentlemen, making their hearts flutter. Who knows, they might follow her. The traveling salesman, no matter how eloquently you speak when trying to get business, saying things like "cheap and good, fast delivery," if the person listening isn't stupid, they'll definitely ask: "Then aren't you losing money?" "Building a reputation is important, making money is out of the question." Traveling salesmen all use this kind of "opening line," and the general affairs staff of banks and companies, they just prick up their ears and listen without caring, but on their mental hard drive, they have already etched the impression of several printing shops that offer 30% discounts on settlements, give gifts during the holidays, and where the traveling salesmen accompany them to drink and play mahjong. Those traveling salesmen don't need to quote prices, don't need to travel, the business comes on its own. Even if the manager of this bank or company opens a printing shop, the general affairs department will only give him a few remittance slips to print, just to save face. The bulk of the work is still sent to other printing shops. Unless, of course, the general affairs staff dies and is replaced by someone else. I'm a new traveling salesman, how could I know the secrets of this world? Sadly, I waste my leg strength every day, running back and forth, wasting my saliva, talking and talking, only to end up having several general affairs staff roll their eyes at me: "There's not much printing to be done here, don't come running here every day. If there's anything to print, we'll call you." This disguised expulsion order made me shudder, and I didn't dare stay any longer. I took a deep breath of cold air: "Goodbye, sir." When I retreated, the tea server would also glare at me a few times, scolding from afar: "Annoying!" Once, Manager Wang introduced me to Xingguo Bank to try to get business. The general affairs director, Mr. Sun, was an acquaintance of his. I went there and met Mr. Sun. He was really impressive,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>tall, with a long face, wearing a vest, and a very thick gold ring on his index finger, shining goldenly.</p>
<p>"Please sit, please sit, we're all acquaintances, we'll definitely take care of your business."</p>
<p>"I hope Mr. Sun will do his best to help."</p>
<p>"We're all family, no need to say so much. Please come by every morning!"</p>
<p>Following his instructions, I made sure to go there around nine o'clock every morning to discuss things. After three days of running around, he said to me: "The ledger design isn't ready yet, but when it is, we'll print at least a few hundred copies." A few times, he was out, and I had to sit on the sofa and wait. But, I, this traveling salesman with a hint of worker-like qualities, sitting in the magnificent bank office, was really causing the important gentlemen to look askance. Sure enough, a gentleman wearing a wool vest came to intervene: "Tea server, tell this traveling salesman to leave and come back after lunch."</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!" I was very understanding, feeling small and insignificant, and didn't dare sit alongside the important gentlemen in the bank. So, without waiting for the tea server to drive me away, I took off running.</p>
<p>Back at the printing shop, lunch was already over, so I paid fourteen coppers and ordered a bowl of plain noodles. I had just finished eating when the phone rang: "Mr. Shi, Mr. Sun has asked you to come over." It was the tea server's voice, so I went again. When I met the tea server, he said: "Mr. Sun left just a moment ago, you came right after him, wait a while." I had already learned my lesson once, so I didn't dare sit, and stood waiting for a long time before Mr. Sun hurriedly came back. His butt had just touched the leather chair when he stood up again and ran outside, catching a glimpse of me, smiling and nodding: "Sorry, too busy today, come tomorrow!"</p>
<p>He finally took pity on me and took out two ledgers, saying: "Print two copies just like these, we need them urgently." I took the printing job back, and the next morning, the phone was ringing like a string of pearls: "What's going on! The ledgers haven't been delivered yet, if they're not here soon, we don't want them anymore... Printing so slowly, and you still want to get business!"</p>
<p>At the end of the month, Mr. Sun finally completed a twenty-dollar transaction. I sent an invoice to collect the money, and he tapped and tapped on the abacus: "Two eights are sixteen, pay sixteen dollars."</p>
<p>"The transaction isn't much, please pay the full amount."</p>
<p>"No, the price is too high, the paper is too thin, and the delivery is too slow, how can I not deduct anything?"</p>
<p>Three bills and one silver dollar, I had to accept them. I finally wrote a receipt. Coincidentally, Xingli Printing Shop also sent a receipt, which Mr. Sun quickly put away, but I had already seen a total amount of "Received seven hundred and eighty silver dollars."</p>
<p>I went back and handed the collected payment to the accountant, and Manager Wang said: "What's going on! This little amount, and you still gave a discount? The ledgers are only worth two dollars each, tell me, where does the paper, labor, ink, and expenses come from? We printed so little, and you still gave an 80% discount, we're practically losing money and about to close down! Mr. Shi, take less of these kinds of transactions." He then took out a spreadsheet, "This month, we lost five hundred dollars, please put in some effort next time, and hurry up and collect a few more debts."</p>
<p>Two days later, Mr. Luo suggested to me: "Mr. Sun from Xingguo Bank, you have to give him some kickbacks, otherwise, all of his business will go to Xingli." So this time when I went, I pulled Mr. Sun aside and quietly said: "Mr. Sun, I'll do whatever you say."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, nonsense, don't say that, Mr. Shi, you're underestimating me." He said sternly, as if declaring his personality was supremely pure, "There really isn't much to print, if there is, wouldn't I give it to you?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Sun, six hundred ledgers, four hundred invoices, have been delivered, please issue a receipt." The traveling salesman from Xingli Printing Shop shouted loudly, interrupting our conversation. Mr. Sun stood up, blushing.</p>
<p>I feel that my talent for traveling salesmanship is too poor, but at the same time, Manager Wang only knows how to exploit the workers, which greatly reduces the workers' efficiency. Often, printing jobs with a one-week deadline take ten and a half days to be delivered. Customers are furious, and the phones are filled with scolding voices like creditors demanding payment. But the machines still hum slowly like old cows during the day, only roaring at night, because there's extra pay for night work. Often, the workers set the wrong type, the proofreader doesn't see it, and when it's printed wrong, the customers return it. The manager says: "Traveling salesman, what were you doing when you received the sample?" Several general affairs staff members, when they see me, also say coldly: "Your products aren't refined, and the delivery is slow, what are you traveling around for, you should close down and go home." Poor traveling salesman – me – in the noise of the machines, I have already judged my future fate. Every time I come back, before entering the door, I always focus and listen to the machines. If they're roaring, my courage immediately grows and I enter happily. If, unfortunately, there's no sound at all, my heart immediately feels like a band of hair is tightly tied around it, and I'm afraid to cross the threshold.</p>
<p>The market is becoming increasingly depressed, and Shunxing's business is gradually declining. The machines sit quietly on the ground, silent all day. The workers are all shirtless, hiding under the windows, secretly playing chess. Several employees are waving palm leaf fans, wandering back and forth in the accounting room. Manager Wang is lying on the sofa, drinking soda, loudly scolding: "Traveling salesman, what are you doing for twenty dollars a month?" At this moment, I just came running back from outside, my clothes soaking wet as if I had just been pulled out of the water, large beads of sweat falling from my face to the ground. I take a breath, preparing to step over the threshold, and when I hear the scolding, I quickly turn around, tears welling up in my eyes, and step onto my path of life, step by step, under the scorching summer sun, on the fiery asphalt road!</p>
<h3>From Trademark Disputes to the Decline of Industry</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Recently, the Family Chemical Industry and the Huanan Chemical Industry have been engaged in a trademark dispute [details in the newspaper]. Both sides have been running large advertisements, each presenting their own strong arguments. In today's immature industrial sector, this is indeed a very serious issue, worthy of discussion. It should be stated that the reporter has no relationship with either party and wishes to explore the underlying causes of this dispute from the perspective of an observer, as well as the obstacles to promoting domestic goods, hoping for readers' corrections.</p>
<p>The cause of this matter is that Huanan Company uses the image of Ms. Hu Die as the trademark for its toothpaste, and the Family Industry believes that Huanan Company intends to confuse it with the company's "Invincible" trademark, and has requested the Trademark Bureau to revoke the registration of the trademark. But Huanan Company did not give up, but ran large advertisements, causing the Labor Bureau to issue a statement that it would "handle the matter according to the law and would never act based on sentiment." The future is unknown, the process is like this.</p>
<p>Here, we judge from the documents and reasons provided by both parties, and cannot help but say that Huanan Company is suspected of "innuendo." Because the use of trademarks with similar or identical sounds for similar items is prohibited by law. And "Hu Die" and "Invincible" - apart from phonetics experts, there is no distinction in ordinary people's mouths, and it also violates the prohibition of applying to similar items. Therefore, in terms of morality and law, Huanan Company cannot avoid considerable responsibility. But the reporter is not a judge, so I don't want to make a final judgment on the right and wrong of the two parties, but want to explore the motives and results of this dispute from the perspective of social psychology.</p>
<p>I believe that "innuendo" and "counterfeit" are no different from theft, and are a major reason for the decline of the domestic goods industry. The basis for this behavior is rooted in the national character of luck and laziness. The earth has no east or west, species have no black or white, human intelligence is equal, why don't we create something new? We must know that taking chances is just an act of viewing oneself as incompetent, but our society is filled with this atmosphere. All scissors sellers are Zhang Xiaoquan, all sauce meat sellers are Lu Gaojian, they don't think about creating their own style, and always want to seize what's already there. However, once a great reputation is overused, it is not enough to gain people's trust, this is really the most foolish and pitiful thing. And under these circumstances, how can the future of domestic industry have a flourishing atmosphere? Originally, competition in the same industry is an upward phenomenon, but it must follow the proper path, and compete on the essence, not on the name. Because "name is the reality of reality," if the reality is achieved, the name will follow. The general customer is not completely stupid, and although they can be confused by the name for a while, in the long run, they must rely on the substance. From the facts, before "Invincible" toothpaste was invented, Japanese diamond toothpaste had an annual sales volume of about five million yuan in our country's market. But now Japanese goods have disappeared, and many rights and interests have been recovered every year. I express my highest respect to Mr. Chen Xujun [although I don't know Mr. Chen]. I think it is worth emulating.</p>
<p>Promoting domestic goods and revitalizing industry are indeed the most important tasks of today. Because now, what we use every day, from a toothpick and a match, to clothes and utensils, are mostly imported goods, leakage is overflowing, which is really regrettable. There are many ways to reserve the labor of the industrial sector, and merchants are making profits, but they must put people's livelihood and the country first. If you turn your guns around and use the policy of self-cannibalization to compete with foreign industries, consumers in the third-party position will be happy to sponsor them. The success of "Invincible" toothpaste is a precedent. In the future, everyone will become an old brand, wouldn't everyone be "Invincible", so why fight with each other now, just to increase the joke? As the saying goes, "the goods sell for copper coins," we know that value is definitely not on a sign, so why should I show weakness? If you want your business to flourish, you only need to return to yourself. Those who have the heart to take chances, please reflect on it!</p>
<p>The main purpose of this text is to hope that people engaged in industry will abandon the mentality of taking chances and compete with others in terms of substance. Because customers are not completely deceivable, and there must be a way to make money.</p>

<h3>Scientific Personnel Management</h3>
<p>— Geng You</p>
<p>Personnel disposition is the most important and most difficult issue to resolve in factory management. In fact, the so-called personnel management is entirely based on the psychological reform of both labor and management, sincere cooperation, fair treatment, not burying their individuality, following the trend of labor, and giving them appropriate work. If personnel management can achieve satisfactory results, then the initial goal of scientific management can be said to have been achieved; in other words, the first step in implementing scientific management is to achieve suitable personnel management, because if labor and management cannot be harmonious, then how can we expect the development of their business?</p>
<p>The location of factories is often based on the convenience of raw material supply and commodity sales, so remote areas with inconvenient transportation are not suitable for the establishment of factories. Conversely, the aggregation point of wheel ports and railways is the most prosperous area for commercial factories. People from all over the world live together, and their origins are different. Therefore, the temperament and habits of laborers are different. It is really not easy to melt them into one furnace.</p>
<p>Humans are the most complex and unstandardized animals. Due to environmental, natural, and other factors, the following differences arise:</p>
<p>(1) Physiological (physical) differences: differences in strength, weakness, height, shortness, fatness, thinness, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Mental differences: differences in talent, habits, hobbies, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Educational differences: differences in the level of education.</p>
<p>(4) Family relationship differences: family joys and sorrows are different.</p>
<p>(5) Ancestral differences: inheritance can be rich or scarce; leaving a good name or a bad name to descendants.</p>
<p>(6) Environmental differences: differences in origin, career, and starting point.</p>
<p>(7) Social situation differences: customs and human relations vary from place to place.</p>
<p>The differences between people are not just the above. Factory affairs cannot be done by one or two people. Large organizations often have tens of thousands of workers. Not only are their personalities different and their origins different, but their diligence, skill, and clumsiness are also different. Therefore, how to make management effective and workers happy to work is a major issue to be explored.</p>
<p>Humans are rational animals. The more suppressed, the more violent the reaction. Therefore, those who do things voluntarily perform better than those who are forced. Personnel management should apply the above principles and set up a personnel department to handle it. The outline of its duties is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The employment or promotion of employees must be suitable for both talent and affairs.</p>
<p>(2) Analyze the nature of the work and the degree of difficulty to determine appropriate remuneration.</p>
<p>(3) The formulation of work standards should be used as a criterion for awards or training.</p>
<p>(4) Research on wage levels.</p>
<p>(5) Labor welfare, health, and safety issues.</p>
<p>(6) Encourage employees, such as implementing awards and other incentives.</p>
<p>(7) Train employees to increase work efficiency, and guide and assist their progress.</p>
<p>The scope of ordinary management is approximately as above. If we further study the situation of each worker, then the only thing left is employee investigation. The points that should be paid attention to in employee investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Each person's education level and experience.</p>
<p>(2) Each person's duties and work performance.</p>
<p>(3) The individual's feelings about the matter, whether there is any dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>(4) The individual's family situation and economic situation.</p>
<p>When implementing the investigation, it is best to be as detailed as possible, because laborers cannot approach the capital party on weekdays, and all their sufferings cannot be leaked. The authorities should use the investigation time to solve this huge problem. In particular, we must pay attention to whether they are interested in their duties, because engaging in any work, wherever the interest lies, will definitely get twelve points of good results, otherwise there will be no hope of improvement!</p>
<p>What needs to be closely watched is the managers themselves. If the managers can have a spirit of great impartiality and guide patiently; have a quick mind and distinguish right from wrong; have an accurate understanding of each person's work diligence; reward, comfort, and train them; and ensure that most laborers are happy to work, then scientific personnel management is almost achieved.</p>

<h3>Recognizing a Thief as a Father, Caught in a Dilemma</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a senior elementary school graduate. Two years ago, I dropped out of school to go into business because my father's business failed. But good things never come in pairs, and misfortunes never come alone. My boss is the public enemy of our people, the little Japanese. The day before yesterday, I decided to resign to implement the non-cooperation policy. But when I think back: if I resign, where will I go? Shanghai has no relatives or friends and cannot survive. Then go back to my hometown? My parents, who cannot take care of themselves, cannot afford to increase their burden. But if I don't resign, how can my conscience be at peace living this life of recognizing a thief as a father? Editor, I am really in great difficulty! Please advise me!</p>
<h3>Wu Xinguo, December 31st</h3>
<p>Editor's Note: Anyone who reads Master Wu's letter will sympathize with him, but "the non-cooperation policy is what any of our people should be willing to die to implement!!" Therefore, it is advocated that Master Wu should still resign. As for the problems after resigning, with two hands, as long as you are willing to endure hardship, it is not difficult to solve personal life. You must know that breaking stones and doing odd jobs is much better than the life of recognizing a thief as a father!! Besides, Master Wu has this ambition, and even if no one appreciates him for a while, someone will eventually promote him; he will not really go to break stones and do odd jobs. Finally, the editor hopes that those in society with power will help him to achieve his ambition. If you want to correspond with Master Wu, please ask the Amateur Weekly Society of the Library to forward it.</p>

<h3>The Success Story of Underwater Photography</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zhanneng</p>
<p>Movies value novelty, and the "novelty" is what photography technicians consider carefully. For example, Williamson didn't know how much effort he put in before the film "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" was made.</p>
<p>Usually, if you want to photograph underwater scenes, you usually store water in a glass tank in the photography field and arrange underwater scenes in the water for shooting. But this kind of photography cannot get the truth of the seabed. The young photographer Ernest Williamson felt this and studied hard. As a result, the ideal became a reality and he finally achieved the ideal of directly photographing the seabed.</p>
<p>Williamson's father, Charlie Williamson, was a famous underwater pipe inventor. Williamson and his younger brother George worked together to improve the underwater pipe invented by their father, making it a freely retractable pipe with large glass installed at the end of the pipe. The mother ship sank the pipe to the bottom of the sea, allowing it to freely photograph on the seabed.</p>
<p>When preparations were complete, the Williamson brothers sank the pipe to the bottom of the sea, ready to photograph. However, because the seabed was too dark, they also sank an electric light that could emit strong light. As a result of sinking the electric light, not only was the seabed bright enough to be photographed, but the fish on the seabed also gathered in all directions when they saw the electric light, resulting in better photos. Thus, the world's first underwater photography was announced successful on June 18, 1913.</p>
<p>Underwater photography is not possible everywhere. It is best to choose a sandy seabed. Also, because of the relationship between the tide and the mother ship's air supply, and because the technicians cannot stay underwater for too long, it takes a long time to shoot an underwater film. Williamson went through extraordinary hard work and effort, and finally made a film titled "Williamson's Underwater Adventure."</p>
<p>Universal Film Company saw this film and greatly appreciated it. Thinking that just shooting underwater scenes was not interesting enough, they had to create a fantasy to make the underwater scenes unfold before the audience to increase interest. So they hired Mr. Williamson to start filming "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea." As soon as this film came out, all the secrets of the seabed were active in our eyes, and our horizons expanded a lot, and we added infinite surprise and magnificent feelings.</p>

<p>New Year Movie Review</p>
<h3>Several Premiere Films</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>This year's New Year's Day, nine theaters are showing first-run films. Movie fans are really lucky. Now I will give a general review of several good films:</p>
<h3>(Nanjing) Bird of Paradise</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Among all the films released on New Year's Day, Bird of Paradise can be considered the best. This film has been introduced in various magazines or publications very early. It is a tragedy that describes the tragedy caused by etiquette [superstition] and more painfully talks about the racial boundaries between whites and natives. At the end, the girl sacrificed her life, making the love even more great. This is also the best work of director King Vidor's life. Even the digressions don't make the audience relax for a second. The natural and magnificent scenery has a lot of beauty in the midst of landslides and tsunamis. The position of the camera is also very clever. The swimming scenes are really like paintings. Dolores del Rio's romantic and private feelings make the script even more tragic. Her humorous expressions and fluent native language can perhaps be called "divine." Joe McCrea also has an amazing performance.</p>
<h3>(Carlton) · · · Wandering Paris</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Warner's comedy stars Al Olsen and Johnson may be unknown to everyone, but the public screening of "Soo,Ooo,Ooo Frenchmen" has raised their value to some extent. There are many dialogues in this film, but few jokes. There is neither singing nor dancing. Therefore, the comedic parts rely entirely on unconscious small movements and "relaxed" performances. The plot is good, and it cleverly describes how to view life as a child's play. In terms of directing, the ability is more than adequate. The photography light and cloth are the most beautiful because they are all five-colored. The actors are very average, and each person can represent the special personality of a certain class of people. At the same time, it also secretly satirizes the magic of money in modern society. Among comedies, this film can be called the best.</p>
<h3>(New Light) ··· Silver Star's Success Story by Yan Nan</h3>
<p>According to general conversations about me, it seems that "Silver Star's Success Story" (What Price Hollywood) is a mediocre film. However, in my opinion, it should be classified as above average. The reason it may not be popular with most people is likely due to the excessive dialogue, yet the dialogue is very brilliant and cannot be omitted. Constance Bennett has made even more progress in this film than in her previous works, artistically progressing in layers as she imitates a girl who is new to the film industry. The song she sings is very commendable, and Neil Hamilton is also extremely competent. Lowell Sherman's unrestrained frankness evokes indescribable feelings. He reveals the emotions of triumph and failure step by step, like mercury seeping into every crevice. His performance before and after is like two different people. Another merit of the film is its candid depiction of the real lives of people in the film industry. The work on the set is more authentic than any other film with Hollywood as a backdrop.</p>
<h3>(New Light) ···· The Murders in the Rue Morgue</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>"The Murders in the Rue Morgue" is a very famous detective novel, and its film adaptation is equally extraordinary. It is not purely a detective film. It has frightening elements; the kind of terror, mystery, and tension can be said to surpass "Frankenstein," yet in reality, this film is also reasonable. The director's skill is commendable, not only keeping ordinary audiences restless but also giving those who have read the novel a sense of "unfathomable" trembling. The entire lighting and photography focus on darkness and horror. Large shadows and urgent shouts have the beauty of a dragon appearing and disappearing. The plot also does its best to create "one wave after another." Bela Lugosi is very capable of displaying his instincts, and every move he makes stirs the audience's psychology. Sidney Fox also has some good points. If you want to tighten your mood, then this is a film not to be missed. It gives you more to savor than a musical or romance film.</p>
<p>Reader Opinions</p>
<h3>"Go to the Countryside"</h3>
<p>— Qu Pingnu</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Daosheng's article "The Need for Rural Cinemas" in the 22nd issue of this publication, I felt very happy.</p>
<p>Who dares to say that people in the countryside do not enjoy entertainment? Look, whenever there is a play at the temple, isn't it always crowded? At the same time, we can also hear news of rural people fighting with actors, supposedly because the actors made mistakes in the play. From this, it can be seen that rural people are as familiar with plays as city dwellers.</p>
<p>Movies are noble entertainment and noble art. Now, they are even recognized as a tool for social education, taking the lead in all kinds of entertainment.</p>
<p>As for its establishment, I feel that building a large cinema in the countryside is completely unrealistic in the current Chinese countryside. Therefore, we don't need to do that. I think there are many large drying grounds in the countryside besides fields and houses. I think we can use these to set up open-air cinemas. As for cold weather, we can use temples and ancestral halls to screen movies. As for equipment, I don't think it needs to be too fancy. Electric fans and water heaters are not necessary. Even the seats can be ordinary. I think as long as we aim to reduce costs, we can make it so that they only have to pay a few copper coins to watch. Only then can it be popularized. This is indeed a new path for the film industry. I hope comrades will quickly "go to the countryside!"</p>
<h3>Wang Renmei Helps Out Temporarily</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Wang Renmei, of "Wild Rose," with her fluent performance and lively demeanor, has now become a first-class silver star. Now, due to the persuasion of Zheng Yingshi and Wang Fuqing of Hengsheng Company, she has temporarily agreed to join the cast of "Spring Tide." The film originally had two female leads. One is a romantic female role, already taken by Ms. Li Li. But the role of the lively girl who ultimately succeeds in love in the play has not been resolved until now. Now, Miss Wang has agreed to help out.</p>
<h3>The 1932 Hollywood Balance Sheet</h3>
<p>— Luo Xiu</p>
<p>Every year, Hollywood is customarily assessed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to determine the best performing stars and award medals. Last year (1932), the best performing stars were announced; the female star was Mantlet Laishuo, and the male star was Leah Byron Moore. Everyone in Hollywood agrees that this is appropriate.</p>
<p>Others, such as the stars who are most bombarded by newspapers, have also been decided. First is Jean Harlow, due to the tragic death of her husband, Paul Bern. Second is Charlie Chaplin, who circumnavigated the globe. And Greta Garbo is listed third.</p>
<p>The richest star is considered to be Chaplin, just the tax he pays on stocks and bonds amounts to seven million, six hundred and eighty-seven thousand, five hundred and seventy gold yuan. Mary Pickford, although she has had few works recently, is listed second, and her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, is third. They are indeed the richest family among the stars.</p>

<h3>The Story of the "Match King" (2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi Meng</p>
<p>Paul's rise did not stop there. This foreman had a daughter named Beibei. She was very beautiful, and in Paul's eyes, she looked like an angel from heaven. Soon, Beibei was also bewitched by Paul, deeply imprinting Paul in her tender heart.</p>
<p>One day, Paul went to the foreman's house. Her bright eyes looked at Paul's face, as if there were unspoken words of love she wanted to pour out to Paul. The foreman was drunk, so happy that he was beside himself. When he saw Paul come in, he shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"This kid is extremely clever. Beibei, do you know who earns the money you deposit in the bank for me every week? Who? Haha, no one, no one earns it. I now have eight names on the list. The owners of those names don't know if they exist in this world. They are all fictitious brothers. Haha, there are eight ghosts, wearing white uniforms, working for Paul and me. Isn't that interesting? This wonderful plan was all thought up by Paul." After he finished speaking, he stumbled drunkenly into the bedroom to find the Duke of Zhou (to sleep). This left Paul and Beibei alone.</p>
<p>"This drunken old man," Paul began, "but this is not a long-term plan either. Sweetheart, how much money is in the bank after all?"</p>
<p>"Four hundred and sixty yuan," she told him softly, her peach cheeks pressed tightly against his face. "Paul, be careful. If he finds out, he will definitely put me to death, and he will definitely kill you too."</p>
<p>"Baby, don't worry. Don't panic until things come to a head. I'll naturally think of something." He kissed her lips and let her go. The drunken old man inside was shouting:</p>
<p>"Beibei."</p>
<p>"It's getting late, I have to go," Paul said goodbye. He finished speaking and left.</p>
<p>Paul returned to his bedroom in the thieves' nest, muttering to himself and calculating the old man's four hundred and sixty yuan, plus his own... a letter was stuffed in from under the door. Paul picked it up, opened it, and looked at it. The letter was from Paul's uncle in Sweden. His uncle owned a small match factory in Sweden. He said in the letter that he was very sorry, he knew that Paul's career in the United States was great, and he did not dare to bother him with small matters, but because he was old, he couldn't manage the factory very well. However, if Paul could not forget his humble family and would kindly come, he would definitely be able to give him some good lessons so that his failing business could be maintained.</p>
<p>Paul hurriedly found a newspaper and flipped to the shipping schedule to Europe. The next day, he secretly went to meet Beibei. On the third day, he was waiting for Beibei across from the bank again. After a while, Beibei came. She stuffed a roll of banknotes into Paul's hand. He could feel Beibei trembling with fear.</p>
<p>"Sweetheart, why are you so timid?" he said. "By the time we leave this place tens of thousands of miles away, I'm afraid that old man still won't know. But it's getting late, you hurry back and pack your things."</p>
<p>"Paul!" Beibei shouted in surprise. She hugged his arm. "Do you love me? Do you really love me?"</p>
