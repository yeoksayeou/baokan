<p>華北停戰協定簽字以後。武力收復失地之無從再談。已爲國人所共知。今後中日間關於東省問題之鬥爭。勝負之數。不得在國際外交壇坫上决之矣。日本方面利用此時會。最近乃布成對華外交之新陣勢其形跡已顯。爲吾人所能窺知者。㈠使石井菊次郎以日本出席世界經濟會議之代表。兼負在國際間解辯日本政策與毁壞中國名譽之使命。此蓋松岡洋右蠻幹失敗。鍜羽東歸以後。日本當局爲謀再圖掙扎。爭勝於後。乃出此偏師。以作將來地步者。㈡希望轉變世界輿論。準備在八月下旬之太平洋學會中。藉討論「滿洲國」問題。從事狡辯。以解釋所謂日本之立塲乃派其國内能言之徒。如新渡户稻造鶴見祐輔等赴坎拿大。㈢由日外務省造成改變對華外交之空氣。宣傳「對於中國放棄從來不　不離政策。而爲積極的對華親善政策。」此種空氣之散布。一方面希圖引誘中國當局。入其勾中。一方面則藉此使國際外交界。聞而深勸中國之認敵作友。摧毁中國在國際聯盟中已得之地位。　　上述日本對華外交之新陣勢。三路進攻。布置極爲完密。其所布之第一第二兩陣線。係明知國聯大會雖通過不利於日之報告書。顧問委員會雖議定不承認僞組織之辦法。而一時决無更積極。更有效之手段。以進行對侵略國制裁。今於武力行動已達相當目的之時。出其全力。向國際外交方面。攻擊中國之立塲。並重築日本之外交陣地。彼之意圖。蓋以爲縱不能立即轉敗爲勝。而藉此緩和形勢。使中國之進行。亦無從加速。以圖逐漸於第三陣。線或更布置第四陣線。以收其功效也。如事實之所昭示。今日國際外交壇坫上之中日鬭爭。已過衝鋒猛擊之時。而爲塹壕持久之戰。吾人倘不能將今日日本所布之外交陣勢。加以攻破者。則將來中國在國際外交上之失敗。恐較密雲塘沽之行成。更爲難堪矣。</p>
<p>石井在美之演說。實爲日本布成對華外交新陣勢後之第一次活動。彼之攻擊經濟抵。制要求於非戰公約上。認爲非法。使各國不再用此種手段。爲國家政策之工具。並誣稱。「二十年來。中國在經濟上對日本施行攻擊始終不懈。日本受其犧牲。」此猶是松岡於去年冬在國聯會議席上　駁倒之舊說也。然石井此次演說。不過初次之嘗試耳。吾人不能以其襲松岡舊說而忽視之。日本對華外交新陣勢現正逐漸展開。我國人其將如柯集中力量。以與之周旋乎。</p>

<p>羅馬人衆歡聲雷動</p>
<p>羅馬、志在保障歐洲和平之四强公約、經過數星期舌敝唇焦有時似已無望之談判後、卒於今夜在此間維納莤亞宮内由英·法·德·意·四國代表簽定第一字、德政府贊成此約之電訊由柏林傳來後、　諾禮節乃於七時半舉行、意首相墨索里尼在旁聽席中擠滿外交界人員之參議院演說、謂此約雖經修正、但不變原稿精神、此約非對一國或若干國而作、並不成立一種聯合戰線、現已戰勝之困難大都集中於公約第三條、該條規定如軍縮會議失敗、四强應互相商榷、以覓取解决懸案之方法、此約現旣批准、可得十年和平、四國依照已通過之方案、重行聲明其期望軍縮會議成功之意、此約不表示以其意思加諸他國之覇權成統治權、英國自始即料及此約之可能性、意國與英國以其在歐之均勢地位、已依據洛迦諾公約成就一種特殊職務、其新表示及其可能性皆可於四强公約中見之、法國從未反對此約、法國對於必須實現之公約、已表示通力合作之模範、所有特殊問題使法意與德法相隔者、可在此約之空氣中以不出此約範圍與精神之雙方協定解决之云、此約原文現已公佈、與昨日巴黎所傳之半官消息略　、此約俟在羅馬正式簽字後即予實施、簽約禮節頗爲簡單、意首相代表意國書諾、英法德大使亦相繼簽第一字、在此約簽字時、維納茜亞宮外有衆齊集、歡呼不已、震耳欲聾、蓋知此約將造成新歷史也、意相墨索里尼應羣衆之熱切請求、出現於露台、迨歡呼旣息、對衆略致數語、意人視此約之締成、乃墨索里尼最大事業之一、可鞏固其世界政治家这地位、而具有左右歐陸前途之潛勢力、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）今晨各報對於四强公約簽字之評論、占重要地位、有若干報紙、一方承認此約之重要、一方對於第一次草案被修改各點、表示保留態度、欲以此責歸諸法國、民衆觀察報、對條約最爲稱贊、略謂「四强公約、爲十五年以來最重要之條約、歐洲對墨索里尼及希特勒、應知感謝、蓋此係二人以最堅决態度、維持歐洲和平之新志願也、」日報謂德國政府、愛護各平之誠意、已有極明顯之證據、因此有權希望軍縮會議、能達確實可見之結果、易言之、即實際上裁軍是也、時至今日、任何國家、均無何種理由、使其逃避實際裁軍之義務、十字報謂外國對德國有種種指責、今德國當局、旣强自抑制、而承認四强條約、則外國對德之浮言、由此可止矣云云（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）據政界消息靈通人士所知、外長牛接脫、及其他若干方面、對於四强條約、雖繼續反對、然希特勒總理個人對於此約之訂立極端注重、故結局德國卒决定撤回修正案、而對各國最後商定之草案毅然簽字、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>葉家花園設療養院</p>

<p>園外附近將再設精神病院等</p>
<p>董事會暫緩設由顏院長負責</p>
<p>棒球蝪等地亦募建中山醫院</p>
<p>江灣葉家花園、捐作國立上海醫學院第二實際療養醫院、其消息已誌昨報、新聲社記者昨復往訪該院院長顏福慶、適因公外出未遇、故由方子川君代見、詳述此事經過、及今後建設計劃、頗爲詳盡、特再補誌如上、以告關心社社公共事業、</p>
<h3 id="c125">經過情形 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>據方氏云、顏院長曾在聖約翰提任敎授、葉子衡先生早年畢業該校、故有師生、雅離校以後、交誼極厚、葉氏爲葉澄衷先生之子、析產時得遺產約四十餘萬、連年經營滬漢、雖未能有長足進展、然仍克保守舊產、未有短絀、本年二月、顏院長與葉先生相遇時、偶涉時事、兼談醫學院、擬設實習醫院時、葉先生因痛心家國、時思舉辦公共事業、爲民衆造福、得此機會、便慨然以葉家花園相贈、該園佔八十餘畝、値價當在百萬元以上迨至華北戰事緊張之時、顏院長北上、辦理救護事宜、在津復與葉先生晤見時、卽正式决定、惟僅限於該園範圍、蓋園之左右、亦均葉氏地產也、</p>
<h3 id="c126">進行計劃 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>惟顏院長爲保持該園固有園林这勝起見、園内决僅設肺病療養院一部、現已開始將園内原有辦公室房屋及亭台等、從　修葺、預期於本月底全部完成、先行開辦、將來病房雖分等級、取價則力謀低廉、一方面則由顏院長於日前函請葉先生於該園之旁、再捐助空地十餘畝、以建築普通病及神經病療養病房、及公等室之用、建築費則院中自籌、預料一星期内、當有復函、且信葉先生必能慨允、毫無問題、至於特設精神病療養院之動機、一因鑒於滬上此種設備、向來未有、一因現有俄人精神病專家柏利、對於精神病之研究、經騐極爲豐富、彼對汉精神病之主張、以爲患斯病者、大都出於環境關係之刺激過度爲多、苟能於風物宜人之地、使其養身心於良好環境之内、則其收效、較之藥石之力更巨、故爲學生實地試騐及補充本市該項設備起見、决定添設該院、關於療養院中所用器械、業已由美國煤油大王羅氏基金、捐贈大部份、另外並向中央衛生部借到部份、故一切已極完備矣、</p>
<h3 id="c127">董會緩設 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>該療養院成立以後、原擬卽設立董事會、以臨督一切進行、惟葉先生主張、祗請顏院長負責主持、不必另設董事會、故董事會暫時緩設、惟顏院畏以此種公共事業、必非一人所能負責、故俟國立醫學院第一實習醫院成立後、屆時再行一併成立、</p>
<h3 id="c128">中山醫院 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>至於第一實習醫院之籌備進行、計擬已有三年、蓋顏院長爲紀念總理孫中山先生起見、於三年之前、卽開始計劃、規模極爲宏大、地點擇定法租界勞神父路中華協進會棒球場等、計共佔地均有百畝以十、一面蓋作校舍、一面卽蓋建醫院、該工主爲美國煤油大王羅氏基金所有、現已去函請其捐助預料本月底、可以接到其答復、經費預算建築費金爲一百萬元、已於方一八以前、由顏院長向各方捐到七十萬元左右、一俟地基决定、再行設法募捐、補足一百萬元預算額、經常基金、亦定一百萬元、卽以建築校舍醫院之餘地、蓋造一優美之住宅、將其收入、抵作百萬元基金云云、</p>

<p>國聞社云、俄油來華傾銷、跌價競爭、致原操遠東油權之美商美孚、亞細亞·英商德士古·等三油公司、受莫大之影響、汽油最漲時、每加侖曾售一元二角、最近鑒於俄油源源而來、相互競爭、不得不跌價、以廣招徠、雖則若亞細亞公司之殼牌汽油每加侖減售八角半、而光華公司經售之俄油、則祗售七角六分五、比較還廉八分半、火油若此競爭之烈、實爲歷來所未有、記者以火油關係上業及交通頗大、似長此以往、難免不再有落價競爭之趨勢、爰特趨訪經銷俄油之光華火油公司、所得詳情如下、</p>
<h3 id="c130">競爭劇烈 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>記者至光華公司、後晤該公司汽油股李主任據談、本公司創辦已歷有年、惟與俄商油遍地公司訂立契約、經銷俄油、差將一載、董事長許世英·總理柯菊初·資本三百五十萬、此一年來所謂競爭時期、　火油之開始、不過四閱月、汽油不過二月、惟此次競爭期中、公司營業、確曾蒸蒸日上、平均上海連本公司在内、共有四大油公司、每月銷費、火油約在一千二百萬箱、（一箱兩聽）汽油達三十萬加侖、今以敝公司一家比例、火油商占四分之一、汽油占六分之一、在此短期間内、而能達到此數、確亦難能、至於將來是否再須跌價、此爲任何人所難預測、不過敝公司與俄商油遍地公司所訂合同、其内容曾聲明兩點、㈠火油無論貴賤、光華所經售之油、必較其他油價爲低、㈡無論油價跌落或低廉至若何程度、其佣金仍必須維持也云云、有此條之訂明、無怪光華油固易推銷、且轉視光華亦樂與競爭矣、</p>

<p>記者嗣復叩以該公司設置没棧、與工部局之交涉、據李所述經過云、敝公司經銷火油以來、油筒設于浦東高橋、近爲發展營業、擬在本埠闢置汽車加油站、當最初請求工部局核准之時、工部局曾復函未准、嗣以其他公司何得設置之理由質之、竟復稱、工部局自有處置之權、不過在禁止範圍之外、其他及屬于自產者、仍得設置、但不能沿靠馬路云云、所謂禁止範圍、卽愛多亞路·靜安寺路·等、彼時敝公司又去函交涉、至最近始來函、仍須遵其前議、因此敝公司以其所謂禁止範圍、仍有其他公司油站之設立、旣不准敝公司之請求設立、則其他油站、亦應一律拆除、方昭公允、何得厚彼薄此、乎所以現已聘請穆安素律師、向領事公堂控訴工部局、所擬呈文、不日卽可送也云云、一椿因火油競爭而起訟累、恐又將開始矣、</p>

<p>丨太倉張濟時君來信丨</p>
<p>主筆先生：</p>
<p>我是現代的一個師範生，我的性情是一個多疑者，無論碰到那一件事，自以爲能够瞭解的，休了，罷了，假如稍有一些疑惑，那末不是問諸老師，就是探討於同學了。先生，今天有一件事，這件事並不是十二分的重要，也不是老師和同學不能解答的，實在因爲他們愈替我解答，我的疑惑愈是增加，因此不得不來請敎於先生了！</p>
<p>昨晚我接到在省蘇中讀書的我的一位老同學的一封信，他信末自己署名爲小蠻，他非但是我的老同學，而且是我的老同鄉，我讀了這封信中的一小段，疑問就發生了。</p>
<p>他信中有一段話，「······自三月前薇妹棄我去後，又遭騙愛情的女騙子之編（好在都是老友說說無紡），逢此精神頽唐，行爲益復乖戾，追念往昔，嘗推書飲泣終日，乃更名「殘受」與「小蠻」，取所愛戀者攫我心去之意也。···」。</p>
<p>先生，關於這小小的一段　，我霍然地發生了不少的疑惑，此刻簡單地寫幾條在下面：</p>
<p>㈠我們靑年學子，處在現時的環境裏，還談得到「戀愛」二字嗎？並且這些工作是否現時靑年急急地應趕的工作？</p>
<p>㈡因爲經過一個沒有價値的挫折而就精神頽廢，行爲益復乖戾，是否現時靑年學子應有的精神意志？</p>
<p>㈢「嘗推書飲泣終日」，這是否戀愛比讀書重要，尤其在現時情境之下，與「救國更要讀書，讀書便是救國」之下？</p>
<p>㈣這種人處在現時環境之下，是否是一個堕落者，懦弱者，不能立足於現時環境之中者？</p>
<p>先生，希望你詳詳細細的答覆我，同時也可使殘受君在迷茫大海中得到一個指南針，感激之至！</p>
<p>答：我們只把戀愛看做同吃飯穿衣一樣，然却有個分别：一日不吃飯則饑；一日不穿衣則寒，但是三年五載不談戀愛，絶不會死。現在國破家亡，一班有權有錢的人方在那兒提倡娛樂，自然别有肺腸，然而你以一班靑年果眞不甘心（理是口頭上而是行動上）做亡國奴，就要無條件地暫且丢開這種沒出息的勾當，去做救亡的工作；果眞在抗日反帝的工作中，碰到了志同道合的女戰士，彼此結合起來，共同奮鬥，敵人在前，則並肩前進，枕藉而死，才是漢子：這是一。</p>
<p>受了一點挫折，便爾精神頽廢，行爲便爾乖戾，這種靑年所謂「三歲之翁」也，尚有何「精神和意志」可言：這是二。</p>
<p>「推書飲泣」就是所謂「眼中流血，心内成灰」，當然要不得。就常理說「讀書」自然比「戀愛」重要，然而若拿足下所引的什麽「救國更要讀書，讀書便是救國」的新玄學來講，那讀書與戀愛實在是一邊半觔，一邊八兩。因爲講戀愛必須還帶有一點感情，在敵人已入我們的堂奥的今日，還在這兒迷信那空洞的「讀書救國」論，那眞文不對題。「賊夫人之子」「亡爾人之國」，「若敖氏之鬼不其餒而？」日帝國主義者必然在旁冷笑我們道：「奴才坯，子！」這是三。第四問，何消說？不具答！</p>

<h3 id="c165">宗敎迷信的另一意義 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>人類文明的進步，往往是參差矛盾的。譬如上海人，如今日知道用飛機救國，去年的報上，却還登着醴陵某山落一飛機，鄉人向之焚香跪拜的消息。同一飛機，認識會相差如此。鄉下人知識淺，文化程度低，自然迷信也多。這很容易解釋；然而同一救國，有的用飛機，有的却到時輪法會中去祈禱和平，救國道塲裏去挽回國難，這道理，就頗不易解。但這并非說道場不可救國，法會無益和平，足穿高跟鞋的摩登太太要進城隍廟去燒香求子，只要丈夫不死，有時倒滿靈騐的，然而時至今日，迷信還能把我們老爺太太的心，抓得這麽緊，也可見宗敎魔力之大。難怪國難方殷，某處的廟宇却急急重修，某處的佛像也忙於裝金了；而近來上海的老爺太太之類，「百年」以後，也時興和尚道士，排塲出喪，陣勢一擺就牽延到一兩條馬路，以爲死後的榮哀。</p>
<p>聽說宗敎是起源於原始人不理解「自然，」但又要依賴牠生活，於是由懷疑面驚嘆，而崇拜，而祈禱，這心理，就成了今日的城隍菩薩，救國道塲。但人類如今久已不是從前的人類了，和「自然」的關係，早已大非比：從前要茹毛飲血的，如今大可以坐着汽車，舒舒服服的到大三元或一枝香去吃中西大菜。即使不能人人一樣，最低也不到拿野物生生的送進口去。其認識「自然」的能力，當然比原始人超出萬倍，然而野蠻時代的把戲，爲什麽竟能留到現在，至終不衰，像苦力頭上挽着的尾巴，在馬路上露天出醜呢？這道理很難解釋。要知道，迷信最深的，往往就都是社會中文化知識最高，出必坐汽車，入必住洋房，履豐席厚，役使「自然」力最多的老爺太太，愚夫愚婦們是只能跟在他們屁股後磕頭作揖的。</p>
<p>到城隍廟後面或大世界旁邊一帶去看相測字，所祈求的并不是望天下雨，而是謀事無成，發財失望：這中間對「自然」的關係已少，對社會人事的祈求已多，就不難知道宗敎迷信的心理，而今不僅是對待「自然」的意義了。</p>
<p>在上者要利用这心理來解决人事，在下者也只好利用這心理來希圖僥倖，宗敎迷信問題，已不能如文豪歌德所說：有了「科學」「科學」「藝術，」就可以無宗敎那麽容易了。單只改變了「自然，」人類文明的進步并不夠。</p>
<h3 id="c166">人死觀 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>大約是二三年前，梁遇春曾提出人死觀問題，希望大家加以研討，但學者們似乎痛恨梁氏忘了他們「拚命爭得的眞理」，因此並沒給以響應，弄得如今還是有「人死」而無「觀」，或者有「觀」而並不是爲着「人死」。</p>
<p>人們都知道、然而却不常想到，在生之邊涯，宇宙的彼岸，還有個「死」。從母胎到墳墓是那麽短促的一條路，高雷（ＡｂｌｄｈａｍＣｏｅｗｌｅｙ１６１８－１６６７）曾把牠稱做ＰａｓｄｅＶｉｅ·像ＰａｓｄｅＣａｌｉｓ一樣；是的，人生就像一個狹小的海峽，我們無從去預計死的到臨，也許每天都可以是我們的末日！死給予我們以機會來看淸自已的面目，我們也得看看死的面目。</p>
<p>死應該不是恐怖，半年前我的交親患着心病，在一個靜恬的冬天的午後，悄悄地，他離開了這個世界：沒半名話，也不見絲毫痛苦，他只安靜地躺着；永别使我由飲泣而嚎啕，但我相信，死不是可怕的。</p>
<p>可是我也曾看見過猙獰的死。鄰居有一個負傷的苦　，盡日竟夜痛苦地呻吟，窒息着，扎掙着，直到斷了最後一口氣；彌留時全身都起着痙攣，死後鎖着眉心，張開嘴，分明是一個痛苦的現象。</p>
<p>但和平的死和解獰的死所給我的，是一個同樣的骷髏。</p>
<p>每個人都是一個骷髏，可是骷髏所默示我們的是什麽呢？也許還有富貴得失的念頭存在空洞的頭設裏，也許在袒露的牙縫中還掛着人間，的愛憎，也　甚麽都歸虚無了，宇宙忘了他，他也忘了宇宙。</p>
<p>我們還抱着這條生命，站在生的立塲上去研討死，我們尋不到死國的消息。在巫卜的口裏</p>
<p>所得到的只是類似人間的情形，這些鬼（如果有的話）是在做着人世的夢，說着人世的　話，並不是死國的眞消息。</p>
<p>遇春死了；也許他還在研討這個問題，但他無從再告訴我們他的心得。</p>
<p>我們都是會死的凡人，如果說「死是生存在活人的記憶上」，那末，我也可以已了。</p>

<p>— 洋狀元</p>
<p>民報第一號時評有醜哉金邦平一則，略謂滿洲政府用其牢籠人心手段，於是有殿試留學生之舉。其哀然爲之舉首者，金邦平也。滿酋之誕日，滿奴袁世凱於天津張盛筵，邀各國領事以以祝滿酋之壽。並召集天津之學生以慶賀之，是日到者數千人，世凱親勉諸生以奴隸語。會散矣，突有一人上演臺，向衆發聲曰：「諸君知兄弟乎？史弟自日本留學畢業，蒙恩賞授翰林院檢討者是也。兄弟本不足數，而聖恩隆重若此，足　朝迁重視學生，諸君勉旃，不患不如兄弟也。」衆人視之，即金邦平也。未幾會散，邦平乘四人輿，旁列銜牌二，一爲賜進士出身，一爲欽點翰林院檢討，招搖過市。人皆側目，竊相語曰，「此外國狀元也！」按民報始刋於一九○五年，即光緒三十一年。逾八年而滿淸亡矣。嗚呼丨城有時而爲湖，海有時而爲田；天上浮雲如白衣，斯須變幻爲蒼狗；彼民報記者孰知三十年來之今日事耶？昔日之金邦平，似亦未可醜詆，今則滔滔者天上皆是也，抑且不限於留學生矣。造成金邦平者，滿清政府耳丨於金邦平何尤？倘民報記者健在，其亦首肯予言乎？民報合訂本，題爲心理學敎科書，蓋以避滿淸政府之耳目。當時滿淸政府因　暴不可近也，而今安在哉？爲之投筆三歎。</p>

<h3 id="c168">病床七日 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 熊湘女士</p>
<p>五月十九日</p>
<p>今天下午搬進了醫院，上午來就診的時候，醫生說：我沒有死去，眞是幸事。我把這話回來學說了一遍，明哥嚇了一跳，馬上逼着我進醫院來住。但我却有些不願意。一來要離開我那如手如足的明哥，二來我住醫院是要增加他的負担的。何况醫院裏這麽寂寞呢？</p>
<p>二十日</p>
<p>大槪是半夜兩點鐘的時候，我醒來了。作了一個夢，頗不痛快，决心忘却的人，不知爲什麽竟又淨上心來。難受得很。夢中聽說連生和端姐結了婚，我去看春姐，却不在家，順便探望新婚的端姐，端姐祗呌我走開，連生連忙跑來拉住我，不放我走，態度很難看。醒來以後，夢境宛然猶在，痛苦得很，祇想尋一把刀來把這痛苦從心中削掉。</p>
<p>從早上五點鐘望起，一直到下午兩點鐘明哥纔跚跚而來，靜哥跟在他後面。如今總算嘗足了相思之苦，而病中更甚於平日。</p>
<p>我是第一次住醫院，一進來就學會了要呌看護做小姐，否則是要遭怪的。想不到這裏竟有這麽尊貴的名稱。</p>
<p>房中共有六個床位，連我在内，有五個病人躺在裏面。一個是紹興人，一個是湖北人，一個是江西，一個是廣東，我們就以籍貫做稱號。我的鄰床是廣東人，聽說她是開了刀的，所以她的病最重，終日脈脈的躺着不響。五人中我的病最輕，所以我也最活動，能夠下床來走動，能夠自已做一切事，不必呌看護們幫忙。大約是三等病房的緣故，一天除舖床，騐温度，吃藥百外，是不大有看護小姐光臨的。廣東人床頭的銅鈴常常搖了半天，沒有人影。有時候聽見隔房有人聲，病人們趕緊呌：「哎哟喲丨小姐······」那回響有的是沒有，有的是：「好，等一會就來。」結果或者來，或竟不來。病人們往往呌得哭，外面却常聽得小姐們和茶房的笑聲。我想不透，醫院裏的人怎麽會訓練得如　殘酷。病院眞和戰塲相似了。然而隔隣的頭等病房中，是從來聽不見病人的呼喊的。人類對人類的殘酷，原也有頭等與三等的分别。</p>
<p>五月二十一日</p>
<p>明哥祗能來陪我半天，走時頗有些戀戀不捨。他走了以後，同房的人開始了一陣議論：紹興人說：「儂兩個頭交關要好，親密得來。」湖北人說：「越要好，病也越要多。」她們大抵都是在工廠裏做工的人，整天都沒有人來探望。病院就好像社會，在三等病房生病的人，大都是孤苦無告的人們。這社會無論走到那裏，階級是分得淸淸楚楚，不會混亂的。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c169">紅蘿蔔鬚 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— ＪｕｌｅｓＫｅｎａｒｎ作　林取譯</p>
<p>李子</p>
<p>擾亂了一會之後，他們仍在舖着鴨毛的床上翻來滾去，於是敎父說道：「畜生，你睡着嗎！」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨沒有，敎父。</p>
<p>敎父丨我也沒有睡关。我想起來。假如你願意的話，我們一路去捉虫去罷。「這主意倒不錯，」紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>他們一同跳下床，穿好衣服，點起一盞褆燈跑到花園裏去了。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚拿着提燈，敎父則拿着一個白鐵盒子，裏面盛着半盒濕漉漉的泥土。盒子裏而儲藏着一些釣魚用的虫。面上蓋着一層潤濕的蘚苔，裏面的虫是水遠不會斷絶的。當下了一整天的雨以後，那收獲是非常可觀的。</p>
<p>「當心不要踏在虫上」，「他對紅蘿蔔鬚說，「輕輕地走呀。如果我不害怕傷風的話，我是寗願脫去鞋子穿着短襪走的。祇要聽到一點點聲音，虫便竄到洞裏去了。但我們祗能在牠離洞很遠的時候才能捉着。我們要突然把牠抓住，並且要稍爲抓得緊一點，免得牠溜掉。假如牠有一半身子已經竄進洞裏去了，那便放了她罷：不然你會把她弄斷的。而弄斷了的虫是一點用處都沒有的。並且她還會使得别的虫跟着腐爛起來，精細的魚兒是不屑於吃這種腐爛的虫的。一部分漁人吝嗇着他們的虫、這實在是不對的。如不用整個的，活的，在小底伸縮着的虫，是釣不到好魚的。因爲虫在水裏動着，魚以爲她們會逃掉，便連忙追上來毫無顧慮的呑了下去。</p>
<p>「我嘗是抓不着她們，」紅蘿蔔鬚咕嚕着，「我的手指却被她們那齷齪的涎水弄髒了。」敎父丨虫是並不齷齪的。虫是世界上最淸潔的東西。她們祇吃泥土，如果我們把她壓榨起來，她也不過回复成泥土而已。我的一份，我是可以把她放在口裏吃的。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨我的一份呢，我是寗願讓給你吃的。請你吃結我看看。</p>
<p>敎父丨這些虫都嫌大了一點。並且要先把她們炸熟，然後舖在麵包上吃的。但小的像李子裏面的虫，我可以生吃。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨對啦，我知道了。所以你使得我一家人嫌惡你，尤其是媽媽，她一想起你，便覺得要嘔的。我呢，我是贊成你担不模倣你的，這因爲你的脾氣很好，我們很合得來的緣故。</p>
<p>他舉起提燈，攀下一枝李樹，摘下幾個李子。他把好的留給自己，把蟲　壞了的遞給敎父。敎父接過來，圓圓的連核一起呑下，說道：</p>
<p>「這是幾顆味道最好的呢。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨啊丨連我都想把它們送進口裏像你一樣吃下去了。不過我怕嘴上會有臭味，我怕媽媽抱吻我的時候會發覽出來。</p>
<p>「這一點氣味都沒有。」敎父說，他對他的敎男的面上吹着氣。</p>
<p>紅蘿蘧鬚丨眞的。你的嘴上祇有烟味。這是一下就可以聞到的。敎父，我很喜歡你，但是如果你不抽烟的話，那麽我便加喜歡你了。</p>
<p>敎父丨畜生！畜生！抽烟是有益於健康的喲。</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>人總得要有口「氣」。反過來說，沒有「氣」，當然不能算是人！</p>
<p>可是，現今的人，大多數就壤在沒有「氣」，！無怪，因爲他們根本就不像人。！而稍有「人氣」的人，偏又不准他有「氣」，放屁或許有份，「吐氣」却碍難照准。所以大家　着氣，結果，在西洋人眼中看來，中國是沒有「人」，因爲中國人大都沒有「氣」。不信，你抬起頭來！</p>
<p>我認爲精神上的苦悶，是最難忍受的。因此，我想起一件舶來品的故事，和一般臌賬朋友解解</p>
<p>據說，美國惠斯康星地方，有一個什麽體育協會，會中有一個裁判員。他是這樣的藐小，這樣的柔弱，所以他處在許多精强粗獷的運動員中，正如沉疴不起的中華民國，處在四週列强虎視耽耽之下，同樣地覺得「汗毛懔懔」但，他畢竟是富有「人氣」的人。他辦事嚴正，絶不因運動員桀傲不馴而有所畏縮。一天，他裁判一位運動員犯規，命他立刻停止比賽。這位運動員不服，且用種種使人忍受不下的言語，痛駡那位裁判員。他，在忍耐，考慮之下，毅然向那位强暴的運動員說；「我要和你决鬥，你太侮辱我了。」那運動員聽到裁判員要和他决鬥，突然停止他的駡聲；驚異地向裁判員審視一下，很疑奇地問他：「眞的要和我决鬥麽？你：：：」「是的，一定和你决鬥，你侮辱我了，」對方毅然的回答，於是，在那運動員揚手狂笑之中，决鬥是開始了！那位藐小柔弱的裁判員，給對方打得鼻靑眼腫，滿面被血；打倒了，爬起來，爬起，又給打倒，啊！這在中國人眼中看來，他豈非是一個「阿戇」！然而，他畢竟是有「人氣」的人！他明知和對方决鬥是有「送命」的危險，但他自視他的人格給人家欺負得太過份了，他雖明知送死，仍毅然和對方决鬥······鬥······鬥······直至他吟呻不支，實力不充他爬起再鬥時，對方也力盡倒地了！事後，惠斯康星的體育界，公判那位運動員應得監禁之罪，而贈裁判員以勇士的金章！</p>
<p>這件充滿着「人氣」的故事，實在太好了！我以前在言語或文字中，常向人談過。同時，我覺得這位裁判員，委實　得可以！我們中國人是沒有這種傻了的！</p>
<p>有人說，中國就壞在沒有這種傻子。我想，說這句話的人，他自已或許就是一個傻子！</p>

<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>某戲院門首，紅白色的電燈，綴成「曲辮子白相按摩院」的幾個擘窠大字，十幾個黄衣警察，腰邊佩着駁壳，白朗林一類的手槍，分站在戲院門口的左右，（注：當局以武裝制止開演）馬路兩頭擠滿了蠕動的人羣，我正用的遲鈍的眼光，盡我所能的向前射去，背後却送來一陣陣抑揚盡致的尖銳的歌聲，　　「毛毛雨，下個不停，微微風，吹個不停，微風細雨柳靑靑······」</p>
<p>這模嬌滴滴的歌聲，傳入了我的耳鼓，不期然的掉轉頭來一探這歌聲的由來，出人意料外的，原來是一位鳩形鵠面，蓬髮鬈鬚，披了件　褸而又骯髒的長袍，大約六十歲光景的赤足老人，躑躅地在閉着嗓子裝腔作調。</p>
<p>「老人呀！你雖然也在这個繁華的市塲，度着你殘餘的生命；但只是點綴辇閙，社會的一切，已經沒你的分兒了；你這樣旁若無人似的歌唱着，是想做無懷氏葛天氏之民呢？還是像屈靈均的行吟澤畔，内心有不可告人的苦楚，纔借此以發洩你的牢騷呢？」我幾乎這樣喊呌出來。</p>
<p>人生如寄，要不應自尋煩惱，東坡這樣說過：「覆盆水於地，芥浮於水，蟻浮於芥，茫然不知所濟，少焉水涸，蟻即竟去，見其類，出涕曰：「幾與子不復相見」丨豈知俯仰之間，有方軌八達之咱乎」？具此達觀，無論窮到怎樣田地，也就無往而不樂；講到國事，已有袞袞諸公負責、塘沽停戰協定，早已簽字、徐此天下太平，更用不着我們窮漢擔心；但是，一般悲觀論者，明知抑鬱不濟事，偏要作無病的呻吟，在下也是這其中的一個爲什麽呢？自亦莫明所以　　「老人呀！你正是一個超然物外的神仙，我羨慕你，我在跟踪追你，要你度我到極樂世界呀！」</p>

<p>面孔的藝術，要算店舖的夥計，最爲講究。他們生著兩副「冷」與「熱」的面孔，一副是對待男顧客用的，一副是對女顧客用的。但對待女顧客之中，還有兩種面孔。一種是對所輕用的，一種是對年老用的。</p>
<p>摩登女子，是社會上重要角色。倘然沒有摩登女子，點綴其間，社會便會黯然無光。</p>
<p>社會的人十們，熙熙攘攘，往來欵接，全仗戴着假面具。倘然把假面具揭去，便不成爲社會。</p>
<p>女人雖有「花瓶」的名稱；但花瓶須具有相當的資格，非盡人可爲。若够不上這資格，便和瓦罐瓦鉢一樣。祗可備家庭實用，不能供人們淸賞。</p>

<p>— 潔心</p>
<p>在天然的時候，人們除過苦於空氣的乾燥和蚊蠅的擾亂外，還會感受到瘟疫的威脅。</p>
<p>竐症的種類很多，像鼠疫，霍亂，腥紅熱，白喉，腦膜炎····等等，都有制人死命的威權。</p>
<p>去年陜西省曾經過一次慘烈的疫禍，當虎列位在開始流行的時候，地方當局爲要喚起市民的注意起見，特别從動物園裏選出一雙老虎，用囚籠裝起來招游城鄉各處、這種舉動中宣轉上是很有效的，但事實上却因西北交通滯塞，藥物轉運困難，結果陜人就在那樣汚疫設備不週的情形底下，死去了百數十萬！</p>
<p>我常常感覺到在夏大做防疫工作，是人人都應該努力的，至於防疫的方法，除過對於飲食起居要特别注意外，還要隨時使用殺菌消毒的藥物。亞洲藥房的「亞林臭水」，是用完備的機力製造，在社會上著有悠久的歷史。此外還有一種最新發明的消毒劑「亞林沙而」，經醫界實騐認爲很合家庭防疫的施用，所以在這裏附帶的介紹一句。</p>

<p>第八回　憤語激靑年辭官遁去　熱心憐少女挾纊親來</p>
<p>江氏見他始終是不肯開口，有話也簡直沒有法子向下說。心裏也就不住的轉着念頭，要如何再提上心裏一套要說的話。約莫有一小時之久桂枝把四隻襪底都快繚補起來了，江氏依然不曾把心裏要說的話記出。就在這時，聽到院子裏，輕輕的有兩聲咳嗽，接着有人問道：前後院全沒有人在家嗎？桂枝放下針線，立刻打開門來一看，只見一個二十附近的姑娘，穿了一件棗紅大衣，頭上戴了白絨繩的帽子，脚下是長統襪子黑皮鞋，很像是個女學生，便道：你我那一家的，我們這兒姓楊。那女學生看他也是個姑娘，說話又很客氣的，便道：請問，這兒不是有一家當軍人的趙家嗎？桂枝道：對的。趙連長的老太爺住在这兒。那女學生道：我剛才到後院子裏去了，不看見一個人。桂枝道：他們家主僕兩個，進城去了。那女學生躊躇着道：這樣遠的路，要我空跑一趟，眞是不巧得很。桂枝看他脅下，夾了一個大包袱，便道：你若是有什麽話，我可以替你轉告一聲。若是不要緊的東西，放在我們家也不要緊，我們給你轉交就是了。那女學生道：我這包東西，就是託趙連長轉交的，又轉一到手······說到這裏，他很現出猶疑的樣子來。江氏在屋子裏迎出來道：這位小姐貴姓，是由城裏來的吧？他答道；我呌黄曼英，一提起來，這裏趙連長就知道的。他說着。有個轉身要走的樣子。江氏道：這樣大冷的天，你由城裏跑來跑去，怎受得了？依我說，你可以在我們家稍微歇一會兒，喝碗熱水再走。屋子雖是不乾凈，倒是很暖和的。黄曼英看到人家這樣子客氣，一定拒絶了不進去坐坐，似乎也是太不給人家面子了，只得點了頭，笑着走進人家屋子裏面來。桂枝也是和這位黄小姐有緣，三言兩語，談得秀投機。（九四）</p>

<h3 id="c215">草花種子的秘密 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 氷玉</p>
<p>大凡植物的種子，一見以爲硬固，沒有生氣的，可是無論那一種種子，都含有生機，不過種子生活的期間，因爲貯藏的方法，稍有不同，大槪它的壽命，以一二年或三四年爲最多，其中也有採取後經過三四月就要死的，說到種子播種後，倘若得到適當的温度與濕氣，自然會發芽，所以種子在貯藏的器中，苟使受了適當發芽的程度、那種子中的營養分，就要起分解的作用，如同在地上一樣的會發芽了。假使貯藏的器具，過於乾燥，那種子就要死的。我國的氣候，因爲到了梅雨期，濕度與温度，逐漸升高，這時期内種子的營養分，常常要分解發芽，一到了酷暑，又容易乾死，所以要保存種子，在這時期内，要非常注意的。</p>
<p>鑑别種子的好壞</p>
<p>我們在家庭園藝中，應當有鑑别種子的常識，就是某種種子，是否能生活的，還是已死的，這種分别的方法，倘若沒有正確經騐的人，當然不易辨識，現在我把普通應當知道而容易分辨的特微，來說一下，第一，看種子的色澤，是不是鮮艶而有活氣，第二，種子的表皮，如有黴菌，那生長就不好了，第三，外面若是看不淸楚，可用小刀割破外皮，看裏面的肉，是否變色，大抵爲白色，倘若已變爲黑色，那已因爲過於乾燥而死了，第四，可用木石壓碎，如水分與油氣不多，那種子亦沒有用了。</p>
<p>種子的休眠</p>
<p>各種種子都有休眠時期，譬如種種取下後，立卽播種，能夠發育優良的，但是也有經過某期間，才能發芽的，這就是種子休眠的現象，總之，各種植物，從春至夏開花，從夏到秋結子，其種子落地，有立卽能發芽生長的，也有到了第二年春，才能發芽的，我們若是搜集種子試騐，差不多有百分之八九十，要經過某期間，才能發芽的。</p>
<p>種子的保存法</p>
<p>種子的保存方法甚多，依種子的種類而不同，普通實用的方法，多用石灰，稻草灰等能吸收濕氣的東西，密封於罐内，放在陰凉的地方，至於普通簡單的保存方法，可盛在瓦器罐内，或磁瓶内，但須用油紙包封瓶口，勿使受潮氣，再放於陰凉的屋角，從前考究的人們，多藏在桐樹做的盒子内，因爲桐樹有防濕性，外面的潮氣不會侵入，種子就不會發生分解。</p>
<p>種子的發芽率</p>
<p>蒔種種子，須選擇種子的形體，大槪大粒的種子，已經完全成熟，發育比較爲快，細粒的種子，或有幾分未成熟這種種子，有百分之二三十，不能發芽的，但是種子的發芽率，依種類而不同，牽牛花，百日草，孔雀草，與蔬菜類的白菜，蘿蔔，蕪靑等，有八九成會發芽，不過發芽的快慢，往往因時期，濕度，土質等關係而有遲早罷了。</p>
<p>發芽試騐與蒔種法</p>
<p>種子的發芽試騐，本來非常困難，一因種子的性質不同，二因氣候濕度差異，同一種子常常不同，現在　我把普通簡單的方法介紹一下，先用種子（除去　芥，泥土）百粒，攤放在吸水紙上面，把那紙置在皿内，皿底須有適當的濕氣，同時爲防乾燥起見，蓋以玻璃片，放在華氏六十度左右温度的室中，有經過四五日，就發芽的也有經過二三星期或一個月才能發芽的，我們就可以計算其百分比，判定其發芽力了，若播種在土中，其土質切不可有肥料性，而且不可種得深，祗覆以一二分厚的輕鬆土，以不見種子爲度，上面遮以稻草，小粒的種子，用報紙遮在上面，不必覆土，早晚用水噴射，在發芽以前，切不可使日光直射，但在蒔種以前，最好用水刀輕輕割破表皮，再浸水十二小時，那就容易發芽了。</p>

<p>— 幻奕</p>
<p>在民國二十二年這種文明時代，談什麽命運的事情，那簡直有些不識時務，至少他是個頭腦冬烘的落伍者。</p>
<p>但，依我看來：命運實在是一椿千眞萬確大可相信的事。當然，事情是要憑證據的。</p>
<p>一個人的所謂貧富貴賤，長壽短命，瞑瞑中老早就註定在命裏的。并且，不獨人是這樣，小而致於一個螞蟻，靜的如一個杯子，一只桌子，大而致於一個國家，都有他的命運，假使命好而運亭通，無論你碰來撞去，决不會遇到倒霉事情，但是，若反是呢？那就糟糕，無論你怎樣，都是藥石罔效的祇好挺死。這是精於命運一道的偉論。</p>
<p>中國的「國命」，大槪終不能說是好的吧！致於「國運」呢？那也糟糕，你只翻開歷史來看一看，眞的熱閙異常，活像戲台上的紅面打白面，白面趕黑臉，就這樣閙了幾千年，簡直沒有交過好運，在六百三十三年中交上二次異族入主的邪運，幸虧天無絶「國」之路，邪運脫掉接連就交進大中華民國的正運，但。畢竟「國命」太苦的緣故，宏運也變成了列運，交上了二十二個年頭，連國的性命差不多半條送掉了。這大槪就呌做命運不濟！</p>
<p>其次再來談一談咱們的「民命」。當然，老子娘的命苦不勝言，那末兒子的命好煞也是微細的了。以前的姑且不談，就把最近的遭遇說說吧。可憐活該受苦的苦命百姓，他們大批的告别閻羅王投身到陽問來的時候，大槪就合上了一張閻王票，彷彿早簽訂了同「生」同「死」同做「亡國奴」的合同。你只要看前幾年陜甘的旱災，受饑餓而死的，一批就幾百萬，前年華中大水災，一沉又是幾百萬，自從九一八之後東北四省因「國運」不隆而失掉，請君入甕而做亡省奴的一筆就是三千幾百萬，活該受災受難的小百姓，你們自己的命是這樣的苦，要去怨的是誰？</p>
<p>所以，無論是難民災民，或是亡省奴，他們都是自己的命運多舛，無關於人家的事。換句話說：因爲他們自己的命運苦，所以招到許多災難，而影響到「國運」不隆，就是人家去救濟他們也是無益的。因此，驅逐難民與禁止難民登岸，實在是各地方在目前不容刻緩的要　。因爲竊人旣然有了窮酸氣，難民災民他們都帶着一副哭傷臉。滿身都是災難氣，假使給他們染傳了，那眞是非動小可，何况正在提倡高尚娛樂，開禁娼妓時的大都會，豈不要大殺風景？</p>
<p>苦命不足談，現在還是轉換風頭談好命，在此，抱歡得很，又要來借重我們的少帥了。龍生龍，鳳生鳳，大帥的兒子當然是少師，惟其是少帥，畢竟他的命與難民災民亡省奴的命，判有天壤之别，逈不可同日而語了。東三省雖亡了，可是他究屬不凡，非但不做亡省奴，却反可逍遙事外。雖小百姓嘩然一時，　　函電如雪片一樣，監察院的彈劾文，眞像俗話說的好「京磚丢去，當個拜年帖子」，可是他呢？因爲命運亨通，福星高照，連毫毛都未曾搖一搖。這是一個　證。</p>
<p>唉！苦命的小百姓，你們去怨的是誰？</p>

<p>我時常要經過一條短短的街，街上除照例一些小的店舖外，一個幽黯的敎堂，尖頂的灰色的鐘樓聳峙着，敎堂的一邊一統屋子是一個初級學校，孩子們在走道上蟻一般聚攏來，奔跑，拍着小球，打架，吵嘴，</p>
<p>早晨，電車把我從遠遠的地方載來敎堂的近旁，下車的有我同别的兩個孩子，問他們爲什麽要這麽老遠的趕來，我得到一個沒有芥蒂的回答，就只是因爲信敎的緣故，</p>
<p>僞善者，在天主的庇佑下，單純，忠心，和善，忍耐的順民，孩子們因苛刻的信道敎育而吃着苦頭，</p>
<p>我有時會逢到一些年高德劭的天主底神權的代理人丨丨神甫，眞是無限高興的事，一個黄昏，我又碰到了一位，因爲一個老丏婆蹲伏街邊求乞，神甫怒形於色，憂鬱地喊了巡警來把她　走，神甫準在發愁地想着，神讉責她已夠苦惱了，還敢在敎堂的近旁犯罪麽！貴國人裝作不見，談笑自若，或許有一二聲遏抑不住的怨恨或歎息，很輕很輕地不曾聽出聲音。</p>
<p>這樣，街上找不出一個不靠本錢及不靠本領吃飯的人，神甫得意地爲了街的體面與安寗辛勤着，</p>
<p>於是，有天天，不知道是一個什麽節，洪亮而莊嚴的鐘聲敲擊着，輝煌的壇前發出奢侈的光，我第一次步進敎堂，全體虔誠地祈禱着，做着彌撒，可笑的嚴重的空氣包裹着空間，主壇的神甫用種種姿態向人祝福，救天主寛恕，人衆受了催眠一般麻木了，</p>
<p>「主啊丨聽着丨有錢的人是無罪的，證據是主賜給他們以錢，故有罪的罰他貧困到死罷，貧困的人即是有罪的人，再主不要降福給他們，讓他們多活幾年，再超脫，亞門！」</p>

<p>李大嫂朝上忽接到一份喜幅，原來是從前還由好懷裏抱大的外甥飛要結婚了，而離開結婚的喜期又這麽的近啊。　　「喂！你看看吧，這張帖子。」李大嫂如此的指着那份剛送來的喜帖，望着他的丈夫說。</p>
<p>「唔？眞的飛要討娘子了嗎？」他這時却含有幾分不信的神情，好像在尋思一個不滿念歳的孩子，經濟尚未能獨立，怎麽馬上要結婚呢？在他正懷疑的一刹，接上她就這樣的說：</p>
<p>「難道你不相信嗎？他們有的是錢，在現實的社會裏，有了錢，就是　個玉人也易容，何况娶個媳婦？」</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「的確，你的話我當然不能加以否認。」</p>
<p>「那末我們稱做舅父和舅母的，該好好的送一份禮呢。」</p>
<p>「要送什麽才行？但我們經濟又是這樣的拮据，如果多送，怎樣辦得到哪？」</p>
<p>「」夠難的！在上海，往常的一般禮讓往來，起碼要出一對眼鏡（兩元解），何况現在的情形是不同，我們是内親内戚，而且又是「長輩」，至少也非有一隻手（五元）·不好送得出啦。」</p>
<p>唉，在這現社會制度之下，這種近於敲竹槓式的禮讓往來，總是牢不可破，假使到了另一個新社會，像結婚一類之事，當事人只須向ＸＸ機關登記一下就行，根本沒有什麽禮與不禮了。」</p>
<p>「這話怎好講呢？好像企圖逃禮，才唱这樣高調，哈哈！」</p>
<p>「雖然你現在還向我微微一笑，但内在的悵惘，畢竟很明顯的可以看得出來。」</p>
<p>「不。問題不僅送禮，還有一椿連帶着送禮的事，急待商量的，你猜吧！」</p>
<p>「什麽？我不知道。」</p>
<p>就是衣服問題，天氣是一天天的熟，去年做的那件「印度綢」祺袍，又舊又小，怎好穿着去受外甥新婦的見面禮呢？」</p>
<p>「······」他却不相干的默不發言。</p>
<p>老是不出聲，我們總得想個辦法的，面子有關。」</p>
<p>「不是程二姐，有件新衣剛剛上身嗎？身段也同你差不多，無妨借用借用，横竪彼此都很相熟的。」</p>
<p>「唔！介便宜？程二小姐的衣裳，自來比龍袍鳳帶還要金貴，請你另作妙計吧！」</p>

<p>— 玲珨</p>
<p>昨天，大約在下午四五時的時候，我剛從學校裏課畢回家，當我正在跨進那大門的一刹那，驟然地聽得隔壁有嘈雜的聲间，什麽至今不育呀，恐怕絶嗣呀，命宮裏犯Ｘ呀······等等的一類迷信話，我想，不知又出了什麽玩意兒，給我那可憐的文丐做投稿的資料了，</p>
<p>爲了好奇心的驅使，同時，也爲了澈底明白這事的究竟起見，我便立刻跑到隔壁馬媽家裏去，</p>
<p>呀，不看猶可，一看倒把我驚呆了，那屋子裏擁滿了人，男的，女的，老的，少的，老太太，少奶奶都有，而其中以老太太少奶奶爲最多，房子的中央，坐着一位年約四五十歲的揚州婆，手中拿着一隻匣子，匣子裏有的是一些紙捲兒，各萬歷書，還有一千泥紙，皮做的三位一體的所謂「靈官」，坐在她對面的，是一位年約二十七八歲的少奶奶，我只聽見那揚州婆的女算命者，對那少奶奶道，「少奶奶，你不要憂，也不要愁，你命宮裏，照你的年歲生月推算起來，正犯着尅子星呢，所以結婚至今，七八年中，並不生育，如果要生男育女的話，那惟有將地尅星解脫，那末有希望，不是如此，恐始終不會生育的······」那少奶奶聽了，立刻說道，「那末如何將尅星解脫呢？」女算命者道，「别的沒辦法，只有請敎靈官，那纔明白」「」</p>
<p>，於是那九算命者，從匣子裏取出那三位一體的靈官，我只看見他在耳朶邊咕嚕咕嚕了一會兒，回頭對少奶奶道，「「</p>
<p>剛纔靈官說，你的尅星，解是好解的，不過犯的太利害，起碼要費八元的錫箔費，連我的手續費二元，一共十元，非此不辦，」「這，未免太貴了，我一時也凑不出這十塊錢，阿好推板些，······」那少奶阴說，這是靈官要用的，如何可推板，我的手續費二元、也是至少限度，再少也不能少了，你如不誠心，靈官就要動氣，那可不是玩的。」女算命很、</p>
<p>鄭重的說，「好，那末，這如此吧、」少奶奶說，於是女算命者拿了靈官，在好的身前身後，上上下下，兜了幾千圈子，然後說道，「你的尅星，已經解脫了，這裏有入粒丸藥，你們二人，各吃四粒，在Ｘ月Ｘ日吃，那天晚上，你們包管受孕得子好了，將來如果生了公郎兒，我還要來討喜錢，吃杯喜酒呢？哈哈？」女算命者表示神通廣大十分得意的說，</p>
<p>少奶奶便去拿了十隻大洋，交付給女算命者，於是那女算命者，滿面春風稱謝而去，</p>
<p>我在旁邊看得十分仔細，不禁嘆道。</p>

<p>突破空氣的沉寂，一聲宏亮的滊笛聲響過後；ＸＸ第一廠的門前吐出來一批竟天沉淪在過份疲憊中的国工和女工。嬌弟也是女工中的一個，她是從一個衰落的鄉村逃亡出來不幸的少女。承一個同鄉李小寳的介紹，她把儘餘的靑春；消磨在機聲軋軋中已有三個月了！</p>
<p>這時她提着一隻緑色琺瑯的飯盒，折出工廠的大門；踽踽獨行於馬路邊旁的水門汀上，朝着不遠的負民窟進發。</p>
<p>經過一段路，折進到一條巷，這裏住居着的芳鄰們；都是在工廠裏勞働的大衆。嬌弟就從第三家後門裏進去，這時初夏的天氣，太陽雖已陷落在地平線的下面，但是天空還沒有被灰色的薄暮罩住，馬路間電燈的光芒；却已孤獨地照耀在發了江的柏油路上。</p>
<p>嬌弟的娘，丨一個半老的婦人丨同樣地被農村裏排擠出來的苦惱兒。已替她勞働的女兒，燒好了一鍋晚飯。</p>
<p>是夜半的時分，正當舞塲裏的無興闌珊，城開不夜的時候。但是在一條死寂的貧民窟裏，却已沉寂得像死去了一樣。嬌弟睡在板床上，兩隻烏黑的眼球；不時的注視着天花板。</p>
<p>在廠一裏向被尊爲鐵面無私的監工林先生，今天爲什麽對自已這樣的低聲下氣。昔日的壯嚴褪去了，而且他還答應下好所夢想着的綺麗美夢。陡然地，好却記起了一件由小姊妹們說起的故事。</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>因爲你是我們的仁慈的指南針，所以我上幾個問題要來請敎，請你不要拒絶，而給我明折的指示吧！</p>
<p>㈠我們的家廟，是甲乙丙三派人都有份的。在甲派下面，又分子丑寅三派。前年該廟因駐兵關係，被匪燒去了。現在各派　　重建，以後　　　　　甲　底下的　派少數人，反對重建；該事已成官　，不知法律上　派少數人　　　　否　。</p>
<p>㈡我族分天地君親師五房　　天地君三房通家譜，親師二房自　家譜。不料君房絶嗣了，又無外親内戚，故無人承繼現在竟有比死者年紀大的人去承繼，　　（就是繼父五十餘歲，繼兒倒有六十餘歲，輩份是適當的）你想這事如果成爲訟案，法律上的結果怎樣？</p>
<p>㈢友人某君，在滬做小販；去年經人介紹，與一個寡婦來往，原想娶以爲妻，以續後代。直至今年，得知該婦吃過冷藥，不會生育的；因这與續嗣目的相背，想各自分散了。可是婦人不肯，、</p>
<p>而且拉住介紹人，要他負責。查該事男女雖然發生關係，但只是姘識，並無正式結婚與契約。分散乃是不可避免的事，不知法律有無責任？因爲恐怕不能解决時，非控於法院不行　！</p>
<p>上列三問題，請先生不吝賜敎爲感。此頌、</p>

<p>編者按：家廟的性質，可以發揚民屬團結的力量，先總理在民族主義理，也曾予以相當的鼓吹。不過這種事情，好雖好，祇可作爲有產階級的點綴品，而不能認爲必不可少的組織。所以你們的家廟燬了，想重行建築，自是佳事。不過所有費用·應由贊成者凑集。少數反對的人，在法律上，是不能硬派出錢的。</p>
<p>一個人的遺產，照現行法令規定，除非死者生前立有遺囑，指定承繼人外；應照後列順序，定其繼承人：㈠直系卑親族，㈡直系尊親屬，㈢配偶，㈣兄弟姊妹：而五服以外之兄北叔侄不與也。照來信看來，君房與其他各房，均已疏遠。如其死者沒有遺囑，該項遺產，應認爲「無人承繼之遺產」，宜申請官廳依法處分。遠房族人，不得染指。　　某君與該婦結識時，諒來有過「願娶她爲妻一的表示。所以這件事，以協議脫離爲上。否則她可以「用欺詐的手段，使人聽從其姦淫」的條文，控告某君。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>武貴雖然是一個飽經世故的人，可是當年看見五夫人和二夫人这間居然那般親熱，完全像同胞姊妹似的，到也眞有些莫明其妙。有多少姨太太，不免被此閙着醋勁，甚至於家神不寧，鷄犬不安，可是這二位夫人却都能推誠相讓，禮尚往來；前次五夫人在二夫人那兒打擾一看，今天便是五夫人的回敬。</p>
<p>這一席酒委實豐盛，連背着蘇老爺偷偷的約來的張文彬也在内，也不過三個人，那禮吃得這麽多，還不是每一碗菜吃上一兩箸便敎女僕搬走了。不過今晚的葡萄酒却足足吃了兩瓶，反正甜密密的，所以二夫人禁不了五夫人的勸敬也就多吃了幾杯。但是她總以爲這葡萄酒裏大槪混着威士忌的吧，不然那裏會這樣容易醉人的，的確，二夫人覺得有一點兒飄飄然了。</p>
<p>關於張少爺的爲人，五夫人從用人們的談笑中也多少知道了一點，但是現在經過他自己一番極有理由的解釋。不免懷疑到蘇部長愈老愈湖塗：難道兩個靑年男女在一道，就一定非有醜行不可？這也未免是過甚其辭的吧。</p>
<p>而且張文彬的人品，也很得二夫人的歡喜，像這樣的一個聰明英俊的靑年，那肯甘心幹那樣的醜事。正因爲過於信任报的原故，所以便親切的多看他幾眼了。只見他那淸秀的眼睛裏閃着水洋洋的醉人的光芒，面頰泛着微紅，不禁暗自讚嘆。</p>
<p>「眞是支那的美男子丨」</p>
<p>然而在張文彬眼中的二夫人，也就别有一種風味，雖然年紀到底大了一點，可是多少總有一種異國情調。一想到這裏，張少爺身便有了莫可明言的軟酥酥的覺感，假如這個女人便是柳姑娘的話，那自己眞是太幸福了。</p>
<p>其後大家都覺得沒有可能再吃下去了，五夫人便親自離開座位開起却斯登舞的唱片來，讓張少爺抱着二夫人跳舞一通，自己却躺在梭發上吸着烟捲。不久，又索性離開房烟，掩上房門跑到洗澡間去了，於是張少爺自然更加大膽起來，跳舞，跳舞，抱得緊緊的跳舞。心頭的跳躍，簡直急促得換不過氣來。</p>
<p>快十點鐘了，五夫人催着張少爺送三夫人回去。然而五夫夫畢竟覺得心頭怪難受的，眼望着二夫人居然歡悅挽着張文彬的手臂走出大門。幸而蘇部不久便從某政府要人的家裏拜望回來，少不了又要和他糾纒　晚　不然，這一惱人的長夜將怎麽　過吃？</p>

<p>— 竹仙</p>
<p>外國明星已重覺美國之可居</p>
<p>勞工部中止澈查影星之國籍</p>
<p>不久以前美國好萊塢盛傳的影星國籍的澈查，現在到底怎樣了？這個問題當幾個月之前，一時甚囂塵有，并且引起了許多外國明星，技師藝術家的恐慌。有幾位恐怕臨頭失面子，都已於事先籍端離美返國，有許多戀棧不去，而靜待「遞解回籍」的處分。現在這問題，好像沒像沒有人提起了。</p>
<p>好萊塢影星國籍的澈查，最初發生於美國勞工部，亦是胡佛總統時代最後的一重公案。須知美國的勞工部，權力極大，凡外僑入境移民等事項，統通在其管轄之内。其最初之目的，雖在保護本國的勞工，不受國我勞工之侵入，而在實際上，却是排外運動之一種表現。起初種種移民條例，是專對亞洲人而發的，所以中國的工人進入美國的，非常困難，往往一些不合法規，就被監禁起來而待原船解回中國。現在移民條例加緊起來，凡歐洲國家的人民，亦都受了拘束，並且不限於工人，而牽涉到電影界的人物了。據說在原則上，無論電影界演員技術工作人等，或是普通的勞動階級，都是一樣的丨丨多一個外國人吃飯，就少一個本國人吃飯。所以勞工部就想驅逐一切外國明星，技術人員等，却忘記了他們扶助及創造美國影業覇權的偉大功績！</p>
<p>現在好了。自從羅斯福總統就任之後，茀蘭昔斯波金斯女士被作爲勞工部長之職。從前主持驅逐外國演員最力的副司長加生氏，已調任他職而另派了一位較爲緩和的人繼任。茀蘭昔斯波金斯女士於就任之後，即向好巫塢影業當局，表示以前勵行的澈查，現已停止。並且說現在國家多事之秋，還顧不到這種小事云云。</p>
<p>在羅斯福總統就任宣言中，我們可以尋得出「睦鄰」兩個字的字樣來。旣以「睦鄰」爲標榜，當然對於好萊塢方面，不便拿鄰家的孩子析駡了一頓，而提了他們的耳朶送回鄰家去。况且倘使美國如此做法，不啻自殺之道。現在歐洲英德各國，尚在竭力羅致美國的傑出電影人才。如金嗓子琴妮麥唐娜，歌舞皇后皮皮妲妮兒，以及康絲登斯克明士，安達樂意斯等，却已被歐洲吸收去了。倘使美國再加意排斥名國人才，豈不是自尋寞落，而促成自身的衰遏麽？</p>

<h3 id="c246">評「大進攻」 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＢｉｇＤｒｉｖｅ</p>
<p>歐戰中的實地攝影</p>
<p>由新聞片剪接而成</p>
<p>將零碎的新聞影片編輯成一部整個的影片，在蘇聯已經被認爲一種新的製片方法，然而這是一種艱難的工作，特别關於Ｍｏｎｔａｇｅ方面。</p>
<p>過去不久，中國有各種義勇軍作戰的影片，如「東北義勇軍血戰史一等等。當然，那些作品在攝影和剪接方面，都不會使我們十分滿意，但是在鼓勵革命民族戰爭的意義上，到底是値得我們注意的了。</p>
<p>那末昨天卡爾登開映的「大進攻」怎樣呢？也是一部戰地新聞片，再加上一些模型的「幻攝」和事後表演肉搏的塲面。因爲在戰塲攝影，事實上Ｃａｍｅｒａｍａｎ必須避免砲彈的轟擊，所以直接衝突的塲面很難攝取。在這一影片中我們所能看得到的，有軍隊開拔，高級軍官以至國王的檢閱。大砲，坦克車，潛水艇，魚雷，飛機，炸彈，死屍，墓地的十字架。</p>
<p>的確，第一次大戰，那種殘酷的印象，在我們的記憶中永遠不會忘記。有多少無辜的大衆，被驅上戰場，雖然他們並不需要戰爭，但是在狹隘的愛國的意義中，他們被鼓勵着離開家庭子女而去殺人以至於被人殺。他們流血他們死亡，他們在戰壕中僵臥着，他們被成維的埋葬。但是每一個軍官的死，却有兵隊的敬禮，樂隊的吹打，棺本上覆蓋着國旗和花圈，當然這是說生時戴着金邊軍帽，死時自然也得威武光榮，這些，在畫面中表現得最爲明顯。</p>
<p>上面已經說過，本片中有許多假的場面，但剪接的手法總算還淸晰，所以在認識這一次大屠殺的眞面目，這一部默片外加口頭說明的「大進攻」，倒也是可以做參考資料的了。</p>

<p>— 福倫</p>
<p>世界經濟崩潰的影響，波及了美國，尤其是世界的影都好萊塢。向來美國的政府，對於好萊塢是採取不干涉主義的。現在態度忽然轉變，國會正在準備澈查好萊塢影業的狀况。澈查事項係影片的生產費，影星的俸給、影片銷塲方法等等。影星們薪給的崇高，是全世界人人所知道的，但現在各公司當局，亦都知道經濟的艱難而思從事撙節了。將來繼訂合同時，最高的薪給大約不超過每星期二千美金。這比較以前最盛時代，不過是五分之一，而比現在還存在的合同，僅是三分之一。這樣一來，一來可以節省經費，二則可以避免國會的干涉。可经說未雨綢繆，一舉兩得之計也。</p>

<h3 id="c248">評「沙場赴義」及「街頭歌者」 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>（題前）在一切的戰事片和武俠片裏，大都是單調的作風，不過這一張「沙場赴義」ＰｒｉｖａｔｅＴｏｎｅｓ却是别具一格的。</p>
<p>（本事）美國的一位懦夫，被迫去投軍。他和副官意見不合，却偏荷副的官夫人埀靑，於是彼此更是仇視得厲害。有一次他和副官出陣探險，被德軍虜去，不久始得逃出的機會，但因毒氣砲瀰漫陣地，他們兩人只找到了一個避毒面具，他意讓與副官，自已冒險逃出，以致受毒而死。</p>
<p>（劇本）在倫理方面，這片子可以算克盡其職的了，自始至始用母愛作中心，直至於死，母親所遣的一枚金幣，仍在他手中，的確非常動人，不過演出時候因爲太趨向於趣味好詼諧兩方面，致使劇本所述寫的前後矛盾。就是次要主角那副官的個性，也根本沒有說出來、而且一個懦夫到後來居然會爲友人奮不顧身的「沙場赴義」嗎？</p>
<p>眞是一個疑問。對於軍隊生活和被虜以後，也形容過火，竟使人不能相信美國軍隊是那樣的無紀律，而德國軍隊也不至於那樣的飯桶吧？這一張片子自始至終是緊凑的，不過也都非情理所有的。　　（劇旨）演出時候，能把社會中每一類人的行動個性，曲曲傳出，增加了不少劇本的力量，例如描寫個人女秘書丨所謂花瓶丨的無恥，軍人丨所謂丘八丨的横蠻···等等都能呌人有很深刻的印象。</p>
<p>（導演）在全劇裏，劇本已鑄成了不少錯誤，當然在攝影場裏很難矯正，不過導演到底是値得我們欽佩的，每一個小的片段，在穿挿上都顯示出導演的聰明，沒有一點，是輕輕放過着，對於劇本裏所有的優長，都能一一發揚展開。末尾，主角雖殆，劇本似乎沒有完，他偏戞然而止，餘味盎然，但可惜爲了太注重滑稽方面，要有充份的「質」也增加了「量」，短短的劇情，竟開映到八十分鐘之久，未免是嫌冗長了。</p>
<p>（技巧）是可注意的是分幕。許多複影，和小鏡頭的拚凑，頗能引人入勝。其次是佈景。戰場上砲火連天的景况，非常淸晰。大段軍樂也極悲壯，堪起頑立懦。空氣爲之緊張不小。對白雖多，尚不乏幽默字句。常有一方而引起哄堂大笑者。可是加入了不少軍隊中俚語，以及極不堪入耳的粗話，却是不敢恭維了。光線攝影，雖有不少精彩處，但我想如果不是膠片用舊，那末一定是洗片曬片時太粗心了。差不多到處都有劃過似的條紋，實爲减色。　　（表演）李屈賽仍是那付不尷不尬的面孔，扮軍人很不錯。有一些像</p>
<p>「少爺兵」裏的裴斯開登）劇情也很有相似處）。更能有不少極深刻的内心面部表情，比已往的片子，進步得多了。言語滔滔不絶，動作呆板，笑料也就供給了不少。其餘演員，都不差。說了嚴重滑稽，兼而有之。</p>
<p>（街頭歌者）二者唱歌片代替了新聞，完全是唱的，我們知道，這是美國最近最流行的無線電放送的著名的曲譜阿斯特屈山的金喉，这裏可以淸楚的聽到，劇情是沒有的，不過爲了這美妙音樂和爵士歌曲，正是潮流中最受人歡迎的，所以順便介紹一下，其中形容女子之爲誘惑，也頗有餘味可尋。</p>
<p>（題外）兩張不錯的片子，還値得一看，不過「沙場赴義」這一個雄壯嚴肅的譯名，是不適宜的。</p>

<h3 id="e16">Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Presides Over the Ceremony</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Central Route Army held a memorial service for fallen soldiers in Linchuan. Chairman Chiang attended and presided over the ceremony. In his speech, he said, "At this memorial service for fallen soldiers, under grief and sorrow, I only hope that I, and the soldiers who die after me, will work together diligently, follow the blood path of the martyrs, and advance bravely, exterminate the Communist bandits who harm the country and the people, protect the party and the country, implement our ideology, complete the unfinished aspirations of our martyrs, and exhaust the responsibilities of us who die later. There is also an important responsibility, which is that for the families of the fallen soldiers, we who die later should sincerely support them. We only know that the lives of all the soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army are whole. Although there is a difference in the time of death, there is absolutely no distinction between high and low in the love and respect of parents, children, and relatives. Therefore, the parents of the fallen soldiers are my parents, and the children of the fallen soldiers are all my children. It is also the parents and children of all of us who die later. If there are any families of the fallen soldiers who have not been given pensions or whose circumstances have not been fully investigated by the government, I hope that all of you soldiers will jointly investigate and report them, so that they can be supported as soon as possible, in order to fulfill the responsibilities of those of us who die later, and also to comfort the souls of our fallen soldiers. In short, our soldiers who died in the suppression of the Communists died for the sake of implementing the Three Principles of the People, for the sake of supporting the party and the country, for the sake of saving the nation, and also for the sake of protecting the people of Jiangxi. It is truly seeking benevolence and attaining benevolence, and there is no regret in death. However, if we who die later do not eliminate the Communist bandits for a single day, then we will not have fulfilled our duties for a single day, and the souls of our fallen soldiers will not be comforted for a single day. I especially announce in this memorial service to the spirits of our fallen soldiers, that together with all of us who die later, we will share the joys and sorrows, live and die together, fight and sacrifice, annihilate the evil Communists, and complete the mission of the revolution. I hope that our soldiers will never forget the tragic history of the loyalty, bravery, and heroism of our fallen soldiers, so as to avenge the public and private hatred of our National Revolutionary Army. The spirit of the fallen soldiers will never die, long live the Three Principles of the People, long live the Chinese Nationalist Party!" (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Zhan Shutang sent two telegrams today reporting on the Yishui society members. The first telegram stated that the society members west of the Yi River have been disbanded, but there is still a group in the northwest that has not dispersed. However, it has already split internally, with leader Zhang Ruiwu leading more than a thousand people to attack Li Mengchun's troops, who are unwilling to disband, in order to show loyalty to the army and militia. The society members have now been completely surrounded. If the society members do not disband, it will not be difficult to resolve the situation. The second telegram stated that the society bandits repeatedly sent representatives claiming that the members of the society were willing to return to their hometowns and live peacefully, and provided a guarantee. They are completely disbanding, but ask for a grace period of three days. They have a sincere attitude. Li Shuchun is scheduled to depart by special train at 5:00 AM tomorrow to go to Juxian. He will implement both suppression and appeasement. Han Jia has sent six political propagandists with propaganda materials to go deep into the countryside with Li to persuade the society members to disband. The Yishui society members have dispersed, and the main road has been opened. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Japan's New Diplomatic Strategy Towards China <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since the signing of the North China Ceasefire Agreement, the impossibility of recovering lost territories by force has been generally acknowledged by the Chinese people. Henceforth, the outcome of the struggle between China and Japan over the issue of the Eastern Provinces must be decided on the international diplomatic arena. Japan, taking advantage of this opportunity, has recently deployed a new diplomatic strategy towards China, the outlines of which are already visible to us. 1) Appointing Ishii Kikujiro as the Japanese representative to the World Economic Conference, while simultaneously tasking him with the mission of explaining Japan's policies and discrediting China's reputation on the international stage. This is because after Matsuoka Yosuke's brash and reckless tactics failed and Kajiwara returned to Japan, the Japanese authorities, in an attempt to struggle again and strive for victory later, have deployed this auxiliary force as a means of preparing for future developments. 2) Hoping to shift world opinion, and preparing to engage in sophistry by discussing the "Manchukuo" issue at the Pacific Conference in late August, in order to explain Japan's so-called position. For this purpose, they have dispatched eloquent individuals from within the country, such as Nitobe Inazo and Tsurumi Yusuke, to Canada. 3) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is creating an atmosphere for changing diplomatic policy towards China, propagating "abandoning the policy of neither attachment nor detachment towards China, and adopting a proactive policy of friendly relations with China." The dissemination of this kind of atmosphere is intended on the one hand to lure the Chinese authorities into their trap, and on the other hand to persuade the international diplomatic community to advise China to recognize the enemy as a friend, thereby undermining China's hard-won position in the League of Nations. The aforementioned new diplomatic strategy of Japan towards China involves a three-pronged offensive, meticulously planned. The first and second lines of attack are deployed because they are clearly aware that although the League of Nations General Assembly has passed a report unfavorable to Japan, and the Advisory Committee has resolved on measures to not recognize the puppet organization, for the time being there are no more active and effective means to impose sanctions on the aggressor. Now, at a time when military action has achieved considerable objectives, they are exerting all their efforts to attack China's position in the international diplomatic arena, and to rebuild Japan's diplomatic front. Their intention is that even if they cannot immediately turn defeat into victory, they can use this to ease the situation, so that China's progress cannot be accelerated, in order to gradually reap the benefits of the third line of attack or even deploy a fourth line of attack. As the facts show, today's Sino-Japanese struggle on the international diplomatic stage has passed the stage of fierce assaults and is now a prolonged trench warfare. If we cannot break through the diplomatic front deployed by Japan today, then China's future failure in international diplomacy will likely be even more embarrassing than the events of Miyun and Tanggu.</p>
<p>Ishii's speech in the United States is in fact the first activity after Japan deployed its new diplomatic strategy towards China. He attacked economic resistance and demanded that the Non-War Pact be considered illegal, so that countries would no longer use this method as a tool of national policy, and falsely claimed that "For the past twenty years, China has been constantly attacking Japan economically, and Japan has been its victim." This is still the old argument that Matsuoka refuted at the League of Nations conference last winter. However, Ishii's speech this time is only a first attempt. We cannot ignore it simply because it reiterates Matsuoka's old argument. Japan's new diplomatic strategy towards China is now gradually unfolding. Will our countrymen concentrate their efforts to deal with it?</p>

<p>The British Monarch Prepares to Attend and Deliver a Speech</p>
<p>Welcoming Representatives from All Countries</p>
<p>(London) Hundreds of people are currently busy day and night at the new Royal Geological Museum in South Kensington, preparing everything so that the British Monarch can welcome representatives from 66 countries participating in the World Economic Conference there on Monday. The main hall, which previously housed geological specimens, is now being heavily decorated, making it exceptionally magnificent, so that it can accommodate an unprecedented international gathering of politicians and experts in London. At one end of the hall, a giant altar in dark green, gold, and three colors has been set up. The British Monarch will deliver a speech through a loudspeaker on top, which will be broadcast around the world. There are also 24 other loudspeakers that will transmit the speech to the 20-odd listeners nearby. A high platform has been set up on the side of the hall to accommodate film and recording equipment. After the brief opening ceremony, the British Monarch will leave the venue, and Chairman MacDonald will deliver a speech. For the first few days of the conference, the chief representatives of various countries will speak on the causes of the global economic downturn and how to remedy it. A total of 2,000 participants will enjoy various special privileges, such as exemptions from licensing restrictions, and unprecedented large-scale facilities for telephone, telegraph, and transportation to all parts of the world. The conference will provide famous wines from around the world to quench the thirst of the representatives during discussions. A 70-foot-long wine room has been built under the venue, so that representatives can choose their favorite beverages to relax and enjoy the pleasure of being at home. The wines provided have been purchased by the conference's beverage provider after consulting with the consulates of various countries stationed in London in advance. It can be said that it is a collection of famous wines from all over the world. (Eighth day Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) According to responsible sources, the preliminary talks of the Economic Conference will be held tomorrow evening by representatives of the finance ministries and central banks of Britain, France, and the United States. The focus will be on international monetary issues, such as the disturbances caused by currency devaluation, and on the remedies proposed by various countries. These talks will continue until Sunday afternoon. (Eighth day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today from reliable sources that the United States will propose at the World Economic Conference the adoption of an international fictitious gold unit, to which the currencies of all countries in the world will be fixed at a definite ratio. This unit will be defined as a standard for international currency values based on a certain fineness and weight of gold, but it will not be used as a commonly used international currency. The US President and his advisors believe that this is the most practical and feasible way to stabilize exchange rates and can avoid speculative behavior on various currencies around the world. Therefore, the value of this fictitious gold unit will not be allowed to fluctuate. As for its weight in gold, it will be approximately between the pure gold content of the gold franc and the US dollar. The United States does not insist on this. If all countries can agree to this plan, it intends to first stipulate the ratio of the gold dollar and the gold pound to this fictitious gold unit, and then move on to the currencies of other countries.

<h3 id="e41">Germany Demands Trade Outlets <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany will demand at the Economic Conference the removal of tariff barriers and the provision of convenience for German exports. Its main reason is that if foreign countries, especially creditor countries, do not provide Germany with export facilities, its ability to repay foreign debt will be severely hit. Although the total amount of Germany's foreign trade has been reduced to one-third during the economic downturn, it has still been able to maintain a huge trade surplus. For example, in 1931, the trade surplus was 2.87 billion marks, and in 1932, the trade surplus was 1.07 billion marks, so it was able to repay all foreign debts and even repay part of the principal. However, in the first three months of this year, there was only a trade surplus of more than 112.7 million marks. According to this situation, it is clearly insufficient to repay foreign debt interest. However, the import of food and industrial raw materials has been reduced to the point where it cannot be reduced any further. There is no way to increase the trade surplus other than promoting exports. (Eighth day National Telegram)</p>

According to US presidential advisors, regardless of Congress's attitude towards the deferral of war debts, President Roosevelt enjoys the power to grant relief under the Constitution.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt informed congressional leaders that in order for Congress to adjourn this week, he did not wish to ask Congress to grant him the power to negotiate tariff agreements. (Seventh day Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) The British government will not pay the war debt owed to the United States that is due on June 15. There is no comment from London. According to non-official opinions here, Britain will inevitably default, forcing the United States to decide on its position on this issue. Officials still believe that since President Roosevelt has not yet received a formal application from the debtor country regarding this issue, the payment due on June 15 will definitely be paid in full. The French Ambassador to the United States, Lai Bo Lai, visited the White House today to meet with President Roosevelt. It is claimed that the purpose of Lai's visit to President Roosevelt was to ascertain the attitude of the United States, rather than to make a specific request. Judging from the situation, any attempt to stabilize currencies before internal price relations have been ascertained is too premature. Britain and the United States have already agreed on this point. (Seventh day Reuters)</p>

<p>Formally Protesting Against Increased Taxes on India</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to what appears to be reliable sources, the Japanese government is currently considering increasing import taxes on British goods in order to retaliate against Britain and India's plans to reject Japanese trade. (Eighth day Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to promote trade, the British government has recently notified the League of Nations Secretariat that it has decided to withdraw from the Treaty on the Abolition of Import and Export Prohibitions and Restrictions established by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations in July 1928. This means that Britain has completely abandoned its traditional free trade policy and is expelling Japanese goods from India and British colonies. The Japanese government has no choice but to seek retaliatory measures and is currently studying countermeasures. (Eighth day Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida telegraphed Director General Miyake of Calcutta last night regarding the protest to the Indian government against the new tariffs, stating in essence that although this measure by your government does not violate the treaty, it is inappropriate to take this action before the meeting of the British Conference. There is much heated debate in our country, casting a shadow on the future of relations between the two countries. Therefore, the Imperial Government, in light of this, sincerely hopes that your government will give it consideration. (Eighth day Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Consul General Nishimura in India today, although Indian tariffs have been increased, the Indian government has unofficially expressed its readiness to negotiate with Japan in order to resolve trade difficulties. It is reported that before receiving the above-mentioned news, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had telegraphed the Japanese Consul General to formally negotiate with the Indian government regarding the tax increase. Officials stated today that if the Indian government can give adequate consideration to Japan's position, Japan is prepared to find ways to manage exports or propose the price of exports. Otherwise, Japan will inevitably consider retaliatory measures. (Eighth day Reuters)</p>

<p>Russia and the US Plan to Establish Large Radio Networks</p>
<p>Japan, Being Surrounded, Feels Extremely Embarrassed</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A radio supremacy war is occurring on the Pacific coast. Japanese radio broadcasting is sometimes obstructed by the radio waves of the 75-kilowatt radio station in Nanjing. The Ministry of Communications is currently planning to establish a 100-kilowatt radio station in Fukuoka to counter Nanjing. However, this plan is not easy to implement due to the impact on other radio stations in Japan. Just as the Ministry of Communications is struggling with this, there is news that makes the Ministry of Communications embarrassed: in the Soviet Union's second five-year plan, it is attempting to complete the radio network in northeastern Siberia, planning to establish 50-kilowatt radio stations in Vladivostok, Nikolayevsk, Khabarovsk, Omsk, Tomsk, and other places to develop resources and popularize education. The Soviet Union's broadcasting of Communist ideology has made the Japanese authorities nervous. After the Soviet Union's plan is realized this time, difficult problems will inevitably arise. The US authorities, stimulated by the Soviet Union's plan, are attempting to establish a large radio network on the west coast. How Japan will establish a plan in the Pacific radio wave supremacy war is a very interesting question. (Eighth day Japanese United Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Vowing to Avenge Her Husband</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Plot Was Leaked and She Was Arrested</p>
<p>(Harbin) A 61-year-old Korean woman, who plotted to assassinate the Commander of the Kwantung Army, Muto, was arrested in advance, which prevented the plan from being carried out. The ban on newspapers reporting on this was lifted after the investigation came to an end. The woman's name is Nam Ja-hyeon. Twenty years ago, her husband was beaten by the Japanese, so she extremely hated the Japanese and repeatedly plotted revenge. Since then, she has been engaged in the Korean independence movement, traveling between Manchuria and Korea. In April of the second year of Showa, she plotted to assassinate Governor-General Saito in Seoul, but failed. She sneaked into Manchuria, based in Harbin, and plotted to assassinate Commander Muto, carrying bombs and a pistol, intending to carry out the plan in Changchun on National Foundation Day on March 1. She was arrested by consulate police on February 20 when she departed from Harbin. (Eighth day Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<p>"A United Front to Guarantee Peace in All of Europe</p>
<p>Not a United Front Against Any Country"</p>
<p>Mussolini's Proud Achievement</p>
<p>After formally signing the initial letters of the Four-Power Peace Pact with representatives from Britain, France, and Germany at 7:30 PM tonight, the Prime Minister of Rome, Mussolini, immediately outlined the text of the agreement to the lower house of Parliament, declaring that this agreement guarantees peace throughout Europe. He also said that the purpose of this agreement is not aimed specifically at any one country, but to obligate the signatory countries to strive to make disarmament effective. He also claimed that this agreement is not a united front against any country, but a united front to maintain peace. If the complete restoration of the economy and the maintenance of peace are to be sought, cooperation with the United States is indispensable. Furthermore, France has now joined us and no longer follows a policy of isolation, which is sufficient to guarantee peace in Europe. Mussolini then traced the peace agreements since the European War, calling the Locarno Pact the first milestone on the path to complete understanding, and said that the maintenance of normal relations between the signatory countries of this agreement is essential to the maintenance of normalcy by all countries. This agreement already contains all the principles of the League of Nations Covenant, which is sufficient to guarantee peace for all countries, etc. (Seventh day National Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome heard that Germany had not yet made a firm expression of acceptance of the Four-Power Pact yesterday morning. In the afternoon, Mussolini personally spoke with German Chancellor Hitler by telephone. It was then that Germany agreed to sign the agreement. (Eighth day Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Full Text of the Four-Power Peace Pact <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The governments of the four countries, knowing their responsibilities as permanent members of the International League of Nations' administrative council and as signatories to the Locarno Treaty, and firmly believing that the world's restless atmosphere cannot be eliminated unless they consolidate their mutual responsibilities, are willing to faithfully fulfill the Locarno Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Declaration on the Prohibition of the Use of Violence, and are willing to make the League of Nations Covenant fully effective in accordance with the predetermined procedures without violating it, and to respect the rights of all countries, therefore, agree on the following articles:</p>
<p>1. The contracting countries shall consult with each other on issues related to themselves and agree to strive for effective cooperation by all countries within the scope of the International League of Nations to maintain peace.</p>
<p>2. The contracting countries shall agree to study together any suggestions made regarding various methods and procedures for making the provisions of this agreement as effective as possible, especially regarding Articles 10, 16, and 19 of the Covenant. However, the power to make decisions shall still be exercised by the competent authorities of the International League of Nations. (Note: Article 10 of the International League of Nations Covenant respects and maintains the territorial integrity of member states of the League of Nations, Article 16 is the sanction against those who violate the agreement, and Article 19 is the amendment of the treaty.)</p>
<p>3. The contracting countries shall do their best to make the Disarmament Conference a success, and agree that after the Disarmament Conference is closed, if there are still issues that are particularly relevant to the contracting countries that remain unresolved, the contracting countries shall re-examine them with each other.</p>
<p>4. The contracting countries shall consult with each other on all economic issues related to their respective interests within the scope of the International League of Nations, especially the economic recovery of Europe.</p>
<p>5. The effective period of this agreement is set at ten years. If there is no notice of termination after eight years of implementation, it shall be extended indefinitely and continue to be effective. However, each contracting country may still give advance notice of termination two years in advance.</p>
<p>6. This agreement shall be written in the languages of the four countries. In case of doubt, the French language shall prevail. Each contracting country shall ratify it as soon as possible. The documents of ratification shall be kept by the Italian government, which shall issue a certificate to each contracting country, certifying that the documents of ratification have been delivered. This agreement shall take effect from the date on which the documents of ratification of all contracting countries have been delivered, and shall be submitted to the International League of Nations for registration in accordance with the provisions of the International League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>The Four-Power Signing Opens</p>
<h3 id="e51">A New Historical Era <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The People of Rome Cheered Loudly</p>
<p>Rome, the Four-Power Pact, which aims to guarantee peace in Europe, was finally signed here tonight at the Palazzo Venezia by representatives of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy after weeks of exhaustive and sometimes seemingly hopeless negotiations. After the German government's telegram approving the agreement was transmitted from Berlin, the ceremony was held at 7:30 PM. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini addressed the Senate, whose audience was packed with diplomatic personnel, stating that although this agreement has been amended, it does not change the spirit of the original draft. This agreement is not made against one or several countries, nor does it establish a united front. The difficulties that have been overcome are mostly concentrated in Article 3 of the agreement, which stipulates that if the Disarmament Conference fails, the four powers should consult with each other to seek methods to resolve outstanding issues. Now that this agreement has been ratified, it can achieve ten years of peace. The four countries, in accordance with the adopted plan, reiterate their hope that the Disarmament Conference will be successful. This agreement does not mean that its will is imposed on other countries in the form of hegemony or rule. Britain had foreseen the possibility of this agreement from the beginning. Italy and Britain, with their balanced position in Europe, have achieved a special duty based on the Locarno Pact. Its new expression and its possibilities can be seen in the Four-Power Pact. France has never opposed this agreement. France has shown a model of cooperation for agreements that must be realized. All special issues that separate France and Italy from Germany and France can be resolved within the atmosphere of this agreement through bilateral agreements that do not go beyond the scope and spirit of this agreement. The full text of this agreement has now been published and is slightly different from the semi-official news transmitted from Paris yesterday. This agreement will be implemented after it is formally signed in Rome. The signing ceremony was quite simple. The Italian Prime Minister represented Italy in signing the agreement, and the British, French, and German ambassadors also signed the first word in succession. When this agreement was signed, crowds gathered outside the Palazzo Venezia, cheering endlessly, deafeningly, knowing that this agreement would create a new history. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, at the ardent request of the crowd, appeared on the balcony. After the cheering subsided, he briefly addressed the crowd. The Italians view the conclusion of this agreement as one of Mussolini's greatest achievements, which can consolidate his position as a world statesman and have the potential to influence the future of Europe.

<p>Italy is Overjoyed</p>
<h3 id="e52">People Formed Processions to Celebrate <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Rome, after Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in the Senate regarding the Four-Power Pact, all members of parliament and attendees stood up, requesting that the speech be widely publicized. Senate President Federzoni immediately ordered it to be done. Throughout Italy, upon hearing of the establishment of the Four-Power Pact, people rejoiced with singing and dancing. The Prime Minister's speech was broadcast everywhere via radio and made into gramophone records. In Florence and Bari, people formed processions to celebrate. Newspapers all published extra editions. The "Tribune" reported that the Four-Power Pact is Prime Minister Mussolini's current undertaking to control European and global political situations.</p>
<p>Rome, the establishment of the Four-Power Pact and Prime Minister Mussolini's speech evoked enthusiastic responses in various Italian cities. In Milan, Turin, Genoa, Verona, Brescia, Livorno, Salerno, Cesena, Trapani and other cities, crowds listened to the Prime Minister's speech broadcast by speakers, cheering Mussolini's name and marching in processions. Provincial governors gave speeches to the people. Workers in Naples decided to hold a grand demonstration on Saturday and Sunday. Newspapers paid much attention to Paris' attitude. Reviews in French newspapers that mentioned the possibility of a French-Italian compromise were recorded in detail. "Le Matin" stated that the long-term improvement of French-Italian relations would finally dispel France's suspicions about the Four-Power Pact. Prime Minister Daladier's speech on the possibility of concluding a French-Italian pact was reprinted by various newspapers. "Il Tevere" reported that Mussolini's ideal is to have the major powers that bear the greatest responsibility in Europe provide long-term guarantees of peace. This ideal has made great progress and is in line with the sentiments of the people, which are more powerful than the usual diplomatic techniques. Europe today is tired of cunning tricks and yearns for life. "Le Matin" said that the Four-Power Pact marks the beginning of a new era in history, a vast picture representing revival, progress, and prosperity, unfolding a bright path. This is what Mussolini's speech indicated to the world. Human civilization found a savior in Rome yesterday. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e53">And Will Improve French-Italian Relations <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The news that the representatives of Britain, France, and Germany initialed the Four-Power Pact with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome was received here with great satisfaction because French officials deeply feared that further delays would affect Berlin's attitude. Officials in the French government believe that the signing of this pact is the first stage in easing the European situation. With this pact established, negotiations will soon continue to determine the practical scope of the Four-Power Pact and to improve relations between France and Italy, and further to seek improvement in relations between Italy and the Little Entente countries. France has been planning this diplomatic procedure for several years. Its significance lies in striving to expand the possibility of coordination among all countries without sacrificing existing treaties. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour has verbally assured the Little Entente countries of this intention. The French authorities are prepared to make another statement, assuring that all countries close to France will receive the same reassurance. Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour will explain the contents of the Four-Power Pact to the Chamber of Deputies on Friday. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome, after French Ambassador to Italy Jouvenel had a lengthy telephone conversation with French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour yesterday, he will now visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to convey that the French government was greatly moved by Mussolini's speech in the Senate yesterday, which mentioned the possibility of resolving outstanding issues between France and Italy. There are many issues awaiting resolution between France and Italy, but there is hope that talks on current issues, especially disarmament, will proceed smoothly. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome, after the Four-Power Pact was agreed upon, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has pardoned Professor Édouard, a Frenchman who was convicted in February for espionage in Italy and sentenced to five years in prison. The trial of this professor, who is the principal of a famous military academy in Paris, had caused much concern between France and Italy. It is reported today that the professor will stay in Italy for a few days to recuperate. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Germany Reluctantly Agrees</p>
<h3 id="e54">Expressing a Policy of Forced Restraint <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The official German position is that the Four-Power Pact, in its current diluted form, has not realized its hopes, but that in the current era, the fact that an agreement could be reached at all is very important. This pact is a new starting point for handling difficult European political issues. Much importance is attached to the clause regarding the revision of the peace treaty, but it is regrettable that the pact fails to reconcile the French and German views on equality in armaments. The Germans clearly stated that they could not accept the French demand for the right to supervise German armaments, and also stated that Germany's declaration of December 5 regarding equality in armaments and Chancellor Hitler's statements in the Reichstag last month remain valid and are not restricted by the Four-Power Pact. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This morning, commentaries on the signing of the Four-Power Pact occupy an important place in the newspapers. Some newspapers, while acknowledging the importance of the pact, expressed reservations about the points that were revised from the first draft, wanting to place the blame on France. The "Völkischer Beobachter" praised the treaty the most, stating, "The Four-Power Pact is the most important treaty in fifteen years. Europe should be grateful to Mussolini and Hitler, as this is their new willingness to maintain European peace with the most resolute attitude." The "Tägliche Rundschau" stated that the German government's sincerity in advocating equality is already very evident, and therefore has the right to hope that the disarmament conference can achieve tangible results, in other words, actual disarmament. As of today, no country has any reason to evade the obligation of actual disarmament. "Kreuzzeitung" said that foreign countries have made various accusations against Germany. Now that the German authorities have shown forced restraint and recognized the Four-Power Pact, the foreign rumors against Germany can be stopped. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to well-informed sources in political circles, although Foreign Minister Neurath and several other parties continue to oppose the Four-Power Pact, Chancellor Hitler personally attaches great importance to the conclusion of this pact. Therefore, in the end, Germany decided to withdraw its amendments and resolutely sign the final draft agreed upon by the various countries. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The initialing and publication of the Four-Power Pact are considered a welcome event here and a sign of the easing of the international situation. The interests of countries other than the four powers and the interests of the League of Nations are all protected, which is very good. However, the effectiveness of the Four-Power Pact depends on the spirit in which it is implemented. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini said yesterday that trust is not false. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>Warsaw, now that the Four-Power Pact has been agreed upon, the statement published yesterday in the "Gazeta Polska" that Poland may withdraw from the League of Nations if the Four-Power Pact is realized is receiving more attention. The newspaper stated that if this pact is completed, the system based on the principle of democracy will no longer exist. Why should Poland remain a member of the League of Nations?

<p>British and American Representatives Exert Great Pressure on France</p>
<p>The Fate of the London Conference Depends on This Move</p>
<p>(Geneva) Various major points of contention, such as security, naval and air disarmament, and the definition of aggressor nations, have once again plunged the disarmament conference into a state of decline. For this reason, the General Committee has decided to adjourn the meeting until June 27. Chairman Henderson will travel to London at the end of this week to consult with the delegations of various countries gathered there to attend the World Economic Conference, in order to eliminate various obstacles that prevent the conclusion of a convention. The hopes of the general public are now focused on the talks among the representatives of Britain, France, and the United States to be held at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris tomorrow. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The American representative Davis has arrived here, preparing to hold disarmament talks at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 8th. Britain will be represented by Foreign Secretary Eden and Air Minister Londonderry. The purpose of this meeting is to achieve some progress on the disarmament issue before the opening of the World Economic Conference on the 1st of next month. In short, Davis hopes to persuade French Prime Minister Daladier to accept the following equation: "Management equals security, which equals disarmament." However, according to the opinions of general observers, it is not easy to persuade France to sacrifice heavy artillery and tanks in exchange for the management it fears lacks substance. According to a Reuters correspondent in Berlin, Berlin regards tomorrow's talks at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the last resort to save the disarmament talks from failure. Political circles in Berlin now believe that British and American representatives intend to exert significant pressure on French cabinet members to reveal what concessions France is prepared to make. If this move is unsuccessful, the disarmament talks will inevitably be unable to continue. All circles in Germany now believe that if disarmament falls into this stalemate, it will be nothing less than the prelude to the failure of the World Economic Conference. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Talks among the representatives of Britain, France, and the United States on the disarmament issue were held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:40 this morning. French Prime Minister Daladier participated in the talks. Those attending from the British side were Air Minister Londonderry, Foreign Secretary Eden, Counselor of the Embassy in France Campbell, and the head of the League of Nations Section of the Foreign Office Cadogan. Those attending from the American side were Chief Disarmament Representative Davis, Legal Advisor Dulles, and Colonel Strohm, a member of the American Disarmament Delegation. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Decided to Use the British Draft As</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Basis for a Disarmament Convention <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>French Representatives Vigorously Oppose</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the General Committee on Disarmament, disregarding fierce French opposition, decided to accept the British draft as the basis for a disarmament convention. Before the vote, the French representatives tried their best to oppose it. The Japanese representatives also stated that Japan cannot accept the provisions prohibiting aerial bombardment unless all aircraft carriers are abolished.</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Committee on Disarmament decided tonight to adjourn the disarmament conference until June 27. During this period, Chairman Henderson is authorized to continue negotiations in Paris and London, and to convene a special meeting in London if deemed necessary. There are still many unresolved issues within the General Committee. It is reported that US Ambassador Davis will persuade British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Prime Minister Daladier, German Chancellor Hitler, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to meet in person as soon as possible, hoping to eliminate the current disagreements. The main points of contention are the issues concerning land, sea, and air defense forces. The provisions on limiting military spending will be completed in the first reading on Thursday, and it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned immediately at that time. Chairman Henderson will revise the British draft during the adjournment, listing several amendments passed by the General Committee in the first reading. It is now believed that it will be possible to decide at the meeting to use the British draft as the basis for the disarmament convention. (Guomin News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The French delegation's note to the disarmament conference details France's attitude toward naval armaments. Its principles are as follows: 1. The naval convention should be universal. 2. The principle of mutual interdependence of various armaments should be respected. 3. The actual situation existing at the beginning of the disarmament conference should be taken into account, and the relative proportions of the fleets of various countries should be maintained. However, small naval powers may, in accordance with Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant, engage in development in appropriate proportions. The provisions of existing naval treaties shall be implemented until December 31, 1936, but the disarmament convention may be subject to strict restrictions. 4. The period of restriction of any armaments in the disarmament convention shall be the same, with sufficient time for various countries to complete their naval construction procedures permitted by the convention during this period. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese representative to the disarmament conference, Sato, issued a declaration to the General Committee of the conference on behalf of the Japanese government, specifically raising reservations regarding the prohibition of aerial bombardment. The declaration stated that if certain concerns can be avoided, the Japanese delegation can also accept the prohibition of aerial bombardment. The Japanese delegation advocates: 1. The complete abolition of aircraft carriers and the prohibition of installing decks on warships sufficient for aircraft to land. 2. The conclusion of an agreement to prevent the conversion of civilian aircraft for military use in wartime. It stated that it is regrettable that the British disarmament plan has not paid attention to these concerns, as Japan is an island nation and has to prevent various dangers arising from the current situation, while the British plan does not mention a word about whether aircraft carriers should be abolished. The Japanese government believes that the restrictions on the quantity and quality of aircraft carriers in the London Naval Treaty are sufficient to create an atmosphere of unease and fear, and are not sufficient to strengthen the sense of security. Therefore, when making important decisions on the absolute prohibition of aerial bombardment, this situation should be reflected on and hesitated. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that aviation lottery tickets are about to be sold out, and the methods for drawing prizes have been determined by various experts with a meticulous plan to eliminate malpractices. The aviation lottery tickets have fifty numbers. If placed in a ball, the middle numbers would be pressed and sandwiched in the middle and could not be shaken out. Now, three copper round balls are used for the lottery. The first ball contains four-digit numbers, from 1000 to 9000. The second ball contains two-digit numbers, from 00 to 90. The third ball contains the lottery ticket. The first ball shakes out four digits, and the second ball shakes out two digits, totaling one lottery ticket. Then shake the third ball.

<p>Hamamatsu, at 8:40 PM on the 7th, the armory of the 7th Flying Regiment in Hamamatsu suddenly exploded. With a loud bang, it destroyed the regiment's barracks and nearby residential buildings. For a time, the entire city was in chaos. At 8:46 PM and 9:35 PM, there were two more explosions, flames soaring into the sky, immediately burning down three armory buildings. The fire brigade rushed to the scene after hearing the news but could not approach. There seemed to be a considerable number of casualties. At 11:50 PM, 500-kilo bombs stored outdoors under the tent were ignited, causing the fourth explosion. At 12:20 PM, there was a fifth explosion, spreading to the volatile oil storage piles.

<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from the Shizuoka Prefectural Office, the reason for the explosion in the Hamamatsu Flying Squadron's armory was that bombs sent from the Okayama Army Ordnance Factory on the 7th were involved in an accident while being transported by twenty horse-drawn carriages. The Hamamatsu Flying Regiment was established in 1925 and is Japan's only bombing regiment. The strength of the regiment is comparable to that of a division. The expenses are huge. It has been dispatched to various battles in Manchuria and Shanghai, undertaking important tasks. This loss is over two million yuan. (Japan United Press, 8th)</p>

<p>Guomin Madrid, August 8 - The Spanish Cabinet resigned en masse today so that Prime Minister Azana could reorganize the cabinet and recruit a new finance minister. Since the current finance minister, Cana, fell ill, the position of finance minister has been temporarily held by the prime minister, so it is urgent to reorganize. Although there are many calls for the overthrow of the Azana government, it is expected that the reorganization of the cabinet will proceed smoothly. In the monarchy era in Spain, from 1834 to 1925, cabinets rarely served a full year. In the ninety years, a total of 113 cabinets were replaced. After that, there was the dictatorship government of Rivera. Since the revolution, the cabinet has only been replaced once in 26 months. The cabinet that resigned today was established in December 1931.</p>

<p>TASS Moscow, August 8 - Mattern, who is attempting to break the record for round-the-world flight, has been missing since leaving Novosibirsk for Chita. As of 5:00 PM yesterday (Moscow time), there was no report from Chita of Mattern's arrival. The observatories in Irkutsk and Verkhneudinsk have also not seen any trace of Mattern's plane. The flying distance from Novosibirsk to Chita is about 2,500 kilometers.</p>
<p>Reuters Moscow, August 8 - A short telegram received here claims that the American aviator Mattern was forced to land 375 miles west of Novosibirsk.

Another telegram states that Mattern was forced to land due to engine damage and that the tail of the plane was broken during the landing. Local mechanics are now assisting in repairing the damaged parts.</p>
<p>Reuters Moscow, August 7 - The plane of British aviator Mattern appeared in the sky over Novosibirsk in western Siberia at 2:10 PM today (British summer time).

<h3 id="e74">Issues Regarding Reception After the Japanese Army's Withdrawal <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>A Reasonable Plan Has Been Discussed; No Separate Committee Will Be Formed</p>
<p>The Issue of Handling Puppet Troops Still Needs Further Negotiation with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Sun Dianying's Name Highly Mentioned for Governing Chahar</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since the signing of the truce agreement, issues such as the withdrawal of the Japanese army and the resolution of the puppet troops have been further discussed by Japanese representatives inviting Chinese representatives, including Xiong Bin, to Tianjin. The Japanese representatives strongly stated that the withdrawal of the Japanese army is not a problem, but due to the complexity of the military branches, the withdrawal must proceed in a certain step-by-step manner, first withdrawing the heavy artillery and supply units, and then gradually withdrawing the forward infantry units. As for the puppet troops, the Japanese representatives suggested that the Chinese side resolve the issue themselves. The Chinese representatives expressed that they were restricted by the agreement and could not use force to resolve it. The Japanese representatives also informally indicated that the police force could be expanded. Detailed measures need to be further discussed after the Japanese representatives meet with the commander of the Kwantung Army, Mutō, in Changchun. Regarding the reception matters after the withdrawal of the Japanese army, some initially suggested forming a reception committee. However, after Xiong Bin and others consulted with Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, they believed that the situation was different from that of Shanghai and that there was no need to form a separate committee. It was decided that the Hebei Provincial Government would take charge. After Yu Xuezhong came to Beiping to discuss the matter with He and Huang, he had already formulated all the plans. Yu returned to Tianjin and can start preparations. Everything is now largely in place. As soon as the Japanese army gradually withdraws, we will gradually take over. The puppet troops in the war zone have been very active in recent days, and the villages east of Lutai have been greatly ravaged. The puppet troops on the Beining Line are mostly concentrated in the Xugezhuang area, with the vanguard only a dozen miles away from Lutai, constantly provoking us. The purpose of the puppet troops is to hope to be reorganized into security teams within the war zone. For the sake of rectifying discipline, the authorities will never incorporate the puppet troops. If the Japanese do not interfere or automatically come up with a solution, we will try to resolve it by force. The number of puppet troops is not very large. Although we are limited by the agreement and cannot send troops to the war zone to suppress them, the police in the war zone can develop their defense rights to maintain local security. Japanese representatives Okamura and others have now arrived in Changchun. It is expected that a solution will be decided within the next few days.</p>
<p>Our army has already withdrawn to the locations stipulated in the truce agreement and does not need to withdraw any further. However, now that the war has stopped, there is no need to station a large army in the north. The transfer of defense and demobilization are being planned. He Yingqin has repeatedly summoned the generals to Beiping to discuss the matter in detail. A reasonable plan has been agreed upon. The first step is to abolish the wartime organization and wartime equipment. The second step is to transfer the defense after the Japanese army withdraws. Now, the wartime serial numbers of each army are gradually being abolished and the original establishment is being restored. All wartime equipment such as military stations and wounded prisoner hospitals are also being closed. As for the defense area of each army, it must be re-designated. A plan has now been set and will be implemented at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>After Feng Yuxiang took office as the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Army in Zhangjiakou, the rebel army of Liu Guitang invaded Zhanyuan, and the situation in eastern Chahar suddenly became tense. The authorities are paying close attention to this matter and have decided to take peaceful measures against Feng. Song Zheyuan has long intended to resign from the position of Chairman of Chahar Province. Since Feng has sent Tong Linge as his representative, it is not appropriate to keep the position vacant for long. In recent days, Sun Dianying's name has been highly mentioned for governing Chahar. Under the current circumstances, it is more convenient to have Sun govern Chahar. Since the outbreak of the war, Fu Zuoyi was originally transferred from Suiyuan to Chahar Province. Later, due to the intense fighting at Gubeikou, he was transferred to the Changping area. Now that the war on the Great Wall has ended, the authorities intend to transfer Fu's troops back to Chahar Province to consolidate the border. (June 6th)</p>

<p>=Public Morale Has Trended Towards Stability After the Truce Agreement Was Signed=</p>
<p>=Feng Leading the Anti-Japanese Movement to Protect Chahar Is Not an Act of Resistance Against the Central Government=</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Central Committee member Zhang Qun and Miao Peicheng traveled south from Beiping by train at 8:00 PM on the 5th. Miao disembarked at Xinxiang, while Zhang continued alone to Hankou, arriving at 6:00 PM on the 7th. Key figures such as He Chengjun, Liu Zhenhua, Jiang Dingwen, and Ye Peng all went to the station to welcome him. Zhang stayed at the Pacific Hotel and planned to take a boat to Xun on the 8th, then proceed to Nanchang to meet with Chairman Chiang and report on the military and political situation in North China. He would stay in Jiangxi for a few days before returning to Nanjing and then soon go north again. A reporter visited Zhang at his hotel and received an interview. He discussed the situation in North China in detail, mainly covering four points: 1) The Sino-Japanese truce was driven by the social forces in North China. The Central Government took this action to meet the wishes of the people. Chairmen He and Wang acted according to the Central Government's intentions. Since the signing of the agreement, public morale in Beiping and Tianjin has been trending towards stability. The articles have already been seen in various newspapers, and there are no additional conditions or so-called "Ning Agreement." The rumors circulating outside are far from the truth. 2) The location of our army's demobilization and stationing has not been fully decided. The special police team taking over the evacuated area will be organized by our side. Reports stating that the Japanese side requested that the puppet troops of Li Jichun be reorganized are absolutely untrue. Furthermore, this unit has a complicated background, and the Japanese side has not admitted to having this army. How to deal with it in the future remains to be decided. 3) The Beiping Political Affairs Committee is currently being actively organized and can be formally established in mid-June. 4) Mr. Feng Huanzhang's actions in Zhangjiakou were initiated at the time to protect the area and express anti-Japanese sentiments, and were not intended as resistance against the Central Government and Chairman Chiang. Recently, Feng sent a telegram to Chairman He in Beiping, detailing his determination to resist the invaders, which is sufficient to prove this. Finally, Zhang spoke about the situation in Sichuan, saying that the current situation is not very clear. The government's handling measures have already been announced. After he arrives in Nanjing, he will contribute what he knows to the government. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Chen Jitang Takes Office as Commander of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Independent 4th Division Commander Deng Longguang Departs</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After preparations were completed, the Southwestern Political Affairs Council appointed Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route of the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian-Hunan-Hubei Bandit Suppression Army, with the same title. Chen was ordered to hold a swearing-in ceremony at 10:00 AM today (the 1st) in the assembly hall of the Political Affairs Council. On this day, almost all party, military, and political officials attended the ceremony. The meeting began at 11:00 AM. After performing the ceremony and receiving the seal of office, Chen raised his right hand and swore an oath. The oath read: "I swear with utmost sincerity to abide by the teachings of the Founding Father, implement the Three Principles of the People, eliminate the communist scourge in the shortest possible time, overthrow the dictatorial government, and complete the construction of the Republic of China in accordance with the procedures set out in the Outline of National Reconstruction. I recognize that soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army must be under the leadership of the Kuomintang and become the armed forces of the people. I am willing to sacrifice my life and freedom to strive for the freedom and equality of the country and the happiness of the people. I will never use force for my own personal gain or be driven by private individuals to destroy party discipline and national law. If I violate this oath, may I be subject to the most severe punishment by this party. May the spirit of the Founding Father be my witness. This is my oath." After the oath, Representative Focheng delivered a speech on behalf of the Southwestern Political Affairs Council, stating that the scourge of the communists is worse than floods and fierce beasts. Wherever the bandit army goes, it wantonly burns, slaughters, rapes, and commits all kinds of atrocities. By the 21st year of the Republic, the scourge of bandits had spread throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. Guangdong Province established a Pacification Commission to be responsible for suppressing bandits in different areas, and at the same time sent the First Army Group to suppress the communist bandits in western Fujian and southern Jiangxi. Now the bandits in the province have been wiped out, but the bandit atmosphere in neighboring provinces is still rampant. Comrade Chen Bonan resolutely took on the responsibility of suppressing bandits in the southern route, taking saving the country and the people as his duty. The future of the party and the country depends on this. Next, Mr. Lu delivered a speech. Chen answered. It meant that I feel that under the leadership of the party government in recent years, the revolutionary work has been delayed and unable to resolve internal and external problems. I feel uneasy whenever I think about it. Fortunately, the province is gradually completing its relief efforts. The urgent task at present is anti-Japanese warfare. I am now in compliance with the Party and government orders, dispatched a large army, determined to achieve the mission of saving the country and the people, and hope that the comrades at the rear will strive for political construction, so that military and political development can be achieved on average. The meeting did not end until 12 o'clock. In the afternoon, the members of the Political Affairs Council hosted a banquet on the upper floor of the council to send off Chen. On the same day, He Jian of Hunan Province also sent a telegram to congratulate Chen on his inauguration, congratulating him in advance, and said that he would also take office as commander of the bandit suppression army on the same day. On the day Chen took office, Deng Longguang, commander of the Independent Fourth Division, led the staff of the division headquarters, as well as the directly subordinate special service battalion, communication unit, engineer company, and mortar company, etc., to leave Guangzhou and Shaoguan by the morning 8:00 train to Shaoguan. The accompanying personnel included Chen Wen, chief of staff of the division headquarters, Cai Hengshi, chief of the staff office, Deng Bohan, adjutant of the adjutant office, Liang Zicai, chief of the military supply office, Zhu Peikun, chief of the military medical office, Wu Jiatao, chief of the military law office, and Deng Changhong, director of the political training office. Li Zhenliang, the deputy division commander, postponed his trip north due to the death of his wife. It is heard that the vanguard of the Fourth Division, the first regiment of Pan Biao's department, has arrived at Pingstone, the second regiment has arrived at Lechang, and the third regiment is also going from Shaoguan to Lechang (1st).</p>

<p>Fang Wangshi, a resident of Hechi Lane in the city, had a daughter named Baobao, who is now twenty years old. She married Wang Xiaohe, a Yue opera performer, as a live-in son-in-law. The couple had a very deep relationship. Baobao became pregnant and felt a slight abdominal pain at 7:00 PM yesterday (the 7th). Xiaohe immediately hired a midwife surnamed Ma from Fenfeng pier to deliver the baby at home. At around 8:00 PM, she went into labor and gave birth to a child. The midwife Ma performed surgery in the hope of removing the placenta. Unexpectedly, as soon as she started, the mother screamed in pain and fainted. What was taken out was not the placenta. The family became anxious and hired another midwife surnamed Chen from the East Gate. Seeing that the incident had already caused a disaster, she refused to start. They then hired Zhang Yuhua, a female obstetrician from Songjiang Hospital, for treatment. Examination revealed that what was taken out was the mother's uterus. It was impossible to save her. She died at 9 o'clock. The midwife's negligence, which caused a person's death, is truly hateful, and the tragic death of the mother is also extremely pitiful.</p>

<p>Commissioner from the Department Comes to Nanhui to Investigate Accusations</p>
<p>He Jiyun, the director of the Education Bureau of this county, has been in office for nearly a year, and his relations with all sectors are still harmonious. However, recently, opinions have gradually emerged with powerful figures in the education sector. Consequently, the principals of all the county's primary schools listed ten accusations and requested the Department of Education to investigate. Furthermore, at a meeting of the Education Funds Audit Committee the day before yesterday, it was decided to check the remaining cash balance of more than 43,000 yuan. Because He was in Shanghai, it was impossible to implement the check. Therefore, the county government was asked to seal the box. Two days later, He returned to the bureau. The committee members, along with party officials, opened the box in the party building. Only more than 2,000 yuan in cash was found. More than 30,000 yuan was later retrieved by He from his home. An inventory of the remaining documents was conducted. As a result, there was a shortfall of more than 2,000 yuan. Thereupon, another report was made. Yesterday, Gu Kebin, a commissioner dispatched by the Department of Education, came to investigate the truth of the accusations. He conducted a detailed investigation at the bureau for a long time. In the meantime, a large number of district chiefs and others personally submitted everything to the commissioner, requesting that the department withdraw the punishment.</p>

<p>Request to Reduce the Silkworm Stove Business Tax</p>
<p>There are more than 200 silk cocoon firms in this year's spring cocoons. Because the number of fresh cocoons produced recently is scarce, two-thirds of the cocoon scales had stopped operating yesterday. However, the late cocoon is still in a large sleep, so the cocoon line that is left is waiting to collect the late cocoon. In addition, the Cocoon Industry Association stated that the number of silkworm stoves in this county exceeded the amount of cocoon production. The cocoon business has suffered losses for many years, and those who are unable to pay are baking cocoons for farmers. Occasionally, there are merchants who try their best to operate, but they only open three or four silkworm stoves and do not open them to the full capacity. The Education Fund Management Office still needs to pay a tax of one yuan per stove according to the number of silkworm stoves. This is not reasonable. It is now heard that Zhejiang Province has approved a reduction of half the amount collected. Therefore, yesterday, a special report was submitted to the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office, the Construction Department, and the Wuxi County Government, etc., requesting that it be allowed to reduce the collection of silkworm stove business tax by half in accordance with the precedent in Zhejiang Province.</p>

Later, he had a conflict with Wu Chengyang, the chief of the Third District, and sued each other in court. As a result, both were injured. Xie was sentenced to two years in prison for embezzlement of public funds, and fined 1,000 yuan. He was pardoned due to the general amnesty. After Xie returned to his hometown from the Suzhou High Court, he trained security guards in the countryside. He was arrested by the county government for another incident. After someone interceded, he was found to be innocent and released. He did not participate in foreign affairs. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 PM the night before, Xie was having dinner at home when three bandits suddenly came, knocked on the door and entered, claiming that they had official business to see Xie. When he came out to see them, the three men immediately drew their guns and fired two shots, hitting vital points, and he fell to the ground and died. His family heard the alarm and rushed out, but the bandits had already fled. His wife came to the court yesterday to file a complaint, requesting that the murderers be arrested and brought to justice.</p>

<p>The Scene of the Journey Was Miserable</p>
<p>The Initial Aspiration to Resist Japan Has Never Been Changed</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of this city, received two telegrams from the generals of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army who arrived in Xinjiang from Russia, reporting on the situation in Xinjiang Province and requesting that the relatives of the generals who arrived in Shanghai be informed. The text is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram 1</p>
<p>To Mr. Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai and Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, to the representatives of the families of the officers, soldiers, and people of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army, Du Xinwu, Lin Xueyan, Gu Xuetao, Zhang Datong, Zhao Huichen, Zhao Huichuan, Shen Junru, Fan Zhizhen, and Zhan Jiazhou, greetings. Our troops departed from Domsk on February 23 by train. Supplies were adequate along the way. On the 26th, we arrived at Ayaguz and waited for the Russian side to prepare the sleighs. After staying for three days, we boarded the sleighs and moved forward in the direction of Tacheng. We traveled through snowy nights and were battered by wind and frost. Recalling the miserable scene at the time, we couldn't help but shed tears. On March 8, we finally arrived safely in our homeland, Tacheng County. At that time, we were warmly welcomed by all sectors of the military, political, academic, agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles in the Northwest. The officers and soldiers were all grateful for the help. The people of Xinjiang welcomed us and looked forward to our arrival. We were given prepared vehicles in Tacheng. After staying for two days, we set off. There were special personnel to receive us at the stations along the way. However, the bandits were not at peace and committed petty crimes at night. Fortunately, our troops were able to protect themselves safely. On April 6, we arrived in Dihua. The four gates of the provincial capital were closed, and the atmosphere was bleak. The traces of banditry and devastation were heartbreaking. We are now stationed outside the East Gate, awaiting orders. Unfortunately, on April 12 at 9:00 AM, we encountered a political change in Xinjiang Province. The time was short, and the handling was agile. The merchants and people were unharmed, and the consulate officials were safe. Our troops, based on the doctrine of national salvation, maintained a neutral attitude. The old and new factions had no idle words, and the farmers, workers, and merchants all expressed their goodwill. We are now issuing uniforms and replenishing weapons and ammunition. The officers are carrying out cadre training, and the soldiers are drilling according to regulations, all to boost their fearless spirit and prepare for unfinished work. All our comrades and families can read the telegram to everyone. Our return is not far away, and the time to meet is just around the corner. In view of your remote connection, we send this special telegram to inform you. Signed, Su Guo, Chief of Staff of the 2nd Brigade of the Infantry of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Telegram 2</p>
<p>To the Tacheng Lu Administrative Director, transferred to the Shanghai Special Municipality Wu Tiecheng and General Zhu, transferred to the representatives of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army returning to Shanghai from the Soviet Union, Mr. Ren Zuotian, Mr. Du Xinwu, Mr. Shen Junru, greetings. Our brigade departed from Domsk and, thanks to protection along the way, arrived in the Xinjiang provincial capital on March 27 and stopped awaiting orders. The local authorities and elders in Xinjiang welcomed and received us with meticulous care. Please reassure them. The officers, soldiers, and families of our brigade are escorted by your enthusiastic protection and must have arrived in the motherland soon. Our friendship is that of comrades, and our anti-Japanese work has not yet been completed. During this period, there is no need to express gratitude. I only hope that you will take the time to inform all the officers and families of our brigade one by one of the situation of our arrival, so that they may understand the truth and avoid anxiety. I also ask you to protect these orphaned ministers and remnants to the end, so as to avoid displacement. If this is the case, we will be grateful to you for the rest of our lives. I am sending this telegram in a distant spirit, without expressing my full feelings. Zheng Runcheng, acting brigade commander of the 2nd Brigade of Infantry of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army, knocks on behalf of all officers and soldiers.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Handling Cargo at the Maigen Road Station Changes Hands <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Official Explanation of Reasons</p>
<p>Labor Union Declaration of Opposition</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Maigen Road cargo station, the railway bureau has canceled the cooperative run by the cargo handling workers on a trial basis, and all cargo handling matters at the station have been contracted to Yang Hengzhen. A reporter inquired with the railway bureau yesterday morning, and the person in charge of the bureau said that the Maigen Road cargo station is the center for cargo transportation on both lines. The railway bureau previously allowed the cargo handling workers to run a cooperative on a trial basis, originally to protect the interests of the workers and the transportation on both lines. However, since the trial began, although there were four foremen, they could neither take responsibility nor manage and restrain the workers. They also did not listen to the station staff's instructions, resulting in the detention of vehicles, control of warehouses, and fighting over work. Such incidents occurred from time to time, delaying cargo transportation for merchants, hindering the safety of railway order, and demanding excessive fees from merchants in addition to the stipulated handling fees. As a result, merchants hesitated to use the station, and cargo transportation at the station has plummeted, causing great losses to the railway bureau. Even the hundreds of workers have difficulty maintaining their livelihoods. Therefore, after several months of investigation and consideration, it was decided to terminate the trial of the cooperative and entrust all cargo handling matters at the station to Yang Hengzhen, who will be solely responsible, in accordance with the Measures for Handling Railway Cargo Loading and Unloading stipulated by the Ministry of Railways. Preliminary contact was made the day before yesterday, and the matter was largely settled yesterday. The railway bureau's announcement and the joint announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Security Office are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Railway Bureau Announcement <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Announcement by the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration: Regarding the announcement of cargo handling matters at the Maigen Road Station of this railway, since it was handled by the workers' cooperative, there has been no absolutely responsible representative to preside over it, resulting in a lack of management and restraint. Railway merchants have felt difficulties, and because there are many workers and little work, the supply and demand have been imbalanced. The workers' income is insufficient to maintain their lives, and even the workers themselves must be suffering greatly. This bureau has carefully examined and believes that this situation is extremely dangerous. If it is not rectified urgently, the railway merchants and workers will not be able to easily benefit from it. It has been decided to temporarily entrust Yang Hengzhen to handle and be responsible for the cargo handling matters at Maigen Road Station, so that railway merchants and workers will not have incompatible drawbacks under a complete management system, and there will be mutual benefits. It is hereby announced to all workers at Maigen Road Station to understand the purpose of this bureau. Hereafter, they must follow the methods reported by the contractor Yang Hengzhen and approved by this bureau, and must not deliberately violate them or cause disturbances. This is of utmost importance. This announcement.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Official Announcement <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Security Office, Public Security Bureau, and Social Affairs Bureau: Regarding the announcement, this is based on a letter from the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, stating that the cargo handling workers at the Maigen Road Station warehouse of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway under the jurisdiction of this bureau had experimentally organized a workers' cooperative in the 17th year (of the Republic), but disputes between workers and merchants have arisen repeatedly, and there has been no end to them. The reason is that the cooperative lacks a responsible representative to preside over it, and there is a lack of management and restraint, resulting in merchants being fearful and avoiding the station, cargo transportation on both lines has declined, and the workers' income is insufficient to maintain their lives due to the large number of people and little work. In the long run, it is not only contrary to the original intention of the trial cooperative, but the workers and merchants are suffering from each other, and the impact on railway transportation and economy is not insignificant. This bureau has carefully examined and believes that industry and commerce cannot cooperate, and the trial has failed. It should be improved urgently. It has been decided to entrust Yang Hengzhen to handle the cargo handling matters at Maigen Road Station and be responsible for rectification. For internal workers, use legal management and control, and for external merchants, use sincere spirit of cooperation, so that both supply and demand can maintain a balance and move towards development together, so that they need each other without hindering each other. Then industry, commerce, livelihood, railway transportation, and social economy will all benefit from it. This move is not only related to the transportation of this bureau, but also to the problem of labor governance in Shanghai. Therefore, the handling of this case will be reported to your office (your bureau) and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau (Security Office and Social Affairs Bureau) (Security Office and Public Security Bureau), and we ask you to issue a joint announcement to persuade the cargo handling workers at the station to listen to the reorganization and not cause disturbances. We sincerely hope for your cooperation, etc., approved. It has been found that the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration's reorganization of cargo handling matters at Maigen Road Station is a great move to increase national income, facilitate industry and commerce, develop social economy, and stabilize workers' lives. It is hereby announced to all cargo handling workers at Maigen Road Station to be fully aware of the sincerity of the railway bureau's reorganization, listen to the restraint of Yang Hengzhen, who is appointed by the railway bureau, and not cause disturbances. If anyone dares to deliberately violate this, report it to the military police nearby for arrest at any time. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>Special Envoy Huang Musong Enters Xinjiang</p>
<p>Will Arrive in Dihua Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, two Junkers aircraft purchased by Eurasia Aviation in Germany were flown by company pilots Lu Ci and others from Berlin, the German capital, at the end of last month, taking the route through Europe and Russia to China. At 4:00 pm yesterday, the company received a telegram from Lanzhou reporting that both aircraft had arrived safely. The test flight of the Eurasia route has been successful. However, the company is not satisfied with this successful test flight and plans to conduct another test flight on the route between Lanzhou and Dihua. At the same time, because Huang Musong, the special envoy sent by the government to Xinjiang, and his entourage of seven people, left Beijing and went west one after another, waiting in Lanzhou for a special plane to enter Xinjiang, after receiving the telegram that the two aircraft had arrived in Lanzhou, they immediately telegraphed to ask the two aircraft to send Special Envoy Huang and others to Dihua immediately. It is expected that Special Envoy Huang will arrive in Dihua tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Union Declaration <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Maigen Road Station Loading and Unloading Branch directly under the Two-Way Union declares that Mo Heng, Director of the General Affairs Office of the Two-Way Administration, led the military police to forcibly cancel the cooperative and restore the contract system. To the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Railways, and to the Silk Party Departments of all provinces and cities across the country, the governments of all provinces, cities, and counties, the special party departments of railways, the railway administrations, the railway unions, the trade unions at all levels in provinces, cities, and counties, all people's organizations, and all newspapers: This loading and unloading branch was established on January 16th, 1929, to undertake the loading and unloading work at the Maigen Road Cargo Station of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The Two-Way Administration formulated 30 articles of the Trial Regulations for the Maigen Road Cargo Station Loading and Unloading Workers' Cooperative. The workers have followed the regulations, served diligently for five years, and have been sincere and peaceful to merchants. They have respected and adhered to the Bureau's instructions. All 769 workers have never had any disputes or disturbances. They have assisted the Bureau in transportation and maintained railway production, with merit and no demerit. Since the Ministry promulgated responsible transportation, the cargo transportation on Maigen Road has suddenly decreased. Recently, the workers' daily hard work has earned less than three or four jiao. Under the high pressure of living in Shanghai, the family members are in distress and hardship, and they have not dared to complain. They hope that the cargo transportation will increase in the future, and the workers may have a glimmer of hope. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 am on June 7th of this year, Mo Heng, Director of the General Affairs Office of the Two-Way Administration, suddenly led Zheng, Director of the Transportation Department, Xie Wenlong, Deputy Director of the Transportation Department, He Jingchong, Cargo Inspector, Wang Qiguang, staff member of the Personnel Section, Huang Renjie, Chief of the Police Section, and the entire class of armed railway police, Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Inspector, and twenty or thirty members of the Shanghai Municipal Security Team, bringing with them contractor Yang Hengzhen to the station, carrying guns and ammunition, with strict security, ordering the branch cooperative to be revoked immediately and handed over to contractor Yang Hengzhen for reception. Director Mo claimed that all workers at the station would listen to the contractor Yang Hengzhen's command in the future. Upon hearing the news, the workers were extremely shocked and could not help but express their opinions to the society, hoping for your consideration. According to the abolition of the contract system and the establishment of cooperatives, it is the consistent policy of our Party to support farmers and workers, and it is also one of the seven movements stipulated by the Central Government. I am especially afraid that the implementation will be ineffective. It has been repeatedly ordered and documents have accumulated. However, Huang Boqiao, Director of this Road, under the leadership of the Kuomintang government, dared to disregard everything, go against the tide, destroy the labor movement, despise the Party, and be harsh to employees. His various improper behaviors are countless and have long been met with resentment. There is no need to hide it. Even with regard to our agency, if there are any inappropriate points, they should also be discussed separately in accordance with the regulations (see Article 28 of the regulations) and be rewarded or punished as appropriate to maintain fairness. But there is no such plan. Now, without education, they are killed. With the section of lightning speed, they led a large number of military police to forcibly hand over. Although the workers are the working people under the leadership of our Party, they are ignorant and do not know whether such actions are the responsibility of the competent authorities under the leadership of the National Government. The workers at this station are subject to the legal supervision and guidance of the stationmaster of this station. Since the agency has undertaken it for five years, all the stationmasters and superiors have never said anything wrong. The responsible leaders can also perform their duties in accordance with the regulations. All the workers at the station have not heard of any violations. The facts are all there and can be seen. Now the Bureau's announcement states that there is no absolutely responsible representative to preside over it, resulting in a lack of management and restraint. I don't know what the basis is. Moreover, the leaders of our agency have already reported to the Bureau for record, guiding the work, with orderly things and unobstructed cargo transportation. How can Director Huang Boqiao cover the world's ears and eyes with one hand? The announcement also says "There are many workers and little work, and the supply and demand are imbalanced." Indeed, but it should be given legal relief in accordance with the revolutionary method, which is the right way to solve it. Now, instead of this plan, it is changed to the contract system, which is tantamount to adding insult to injury and putting our workers to death. Can the supply and demand be adjusted as soon as the contractor is restored? The workers have never heard of it before and should not laugh at it. Moreover, the workers have always sought common welfare in the spirit of cooperation, sharing weal and woe, and living and dying together. How can they seek skin with a tiger? Even if they die, they will have no place to be buried. There are more than 60 stations on both lines, and there are loading and unloading branches directly under the Two-Way Union in each major station. There are organizations of cooperatives in each major station, and there are loading and unloading workers in each small station. Even if the Bureau ignores the Party and the country and wants to restore the contract system and cancel the cooperative, it should also use other methods to seek a solution. It needs the guidance of three directors and the protection of a large number of military police for a small contractor to receive the station, which is the first hearing in the national railway and the new record in the world railway. The majesty of this contractor is really chilling. The above points are just a few of the most important ones. At this time of panic and uncertainty for the workers, on the day when their lives are at stake, in addition to legally submitting to the Party Department and the Union on both lines, and forwarding them to the Ministry and the Central Government for legal disposal, I would like to ask all sectors to uphold public opinion and provide assistance in accordance with the consistent policy of our Party. The workers can only fight to the death with the environment and will never yield. This is a declaration, Zheng Yongxing, Shen Yuqing, Zhang Zichang, and Song Kaigui, the officers of the Maigen Road Station Loading and Unloading Branch directly under the Railway Union of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway directly under the Ministry of Railways, led the fifteen group leaders and all 769 workers to knock.</p>

<p>According to the discussion, the political organization of Mongolia and Tibet are different. Mongolia rules the people with the military, while Tibet rules the people with religion. The Dalai Lama seizes all the power in Tibet. Under him, there are four Gabuluns, who are responsible for religion, politics, military affairs, and finance. Regarding important events in Tibet, they must be decided by the conference of the three major temples of Baiming Temple, Gandan Temple, and Sera Temple. Tibetan people are divided into four classes: monks, nobles, commoners, and slaves. Monks are the most noble because Tibetans all believe in Buddhism. Slaves are the private property of monks and nobles. The disparity in inequality is very contrary to the original purpose of Buddhism.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Urgent Development <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Tibet has a vast territory and a sparse population. Gold is everywhere, but no one has developed it. The richness of the mineral resources is not inferior to the three northeastern provinces. The wilderness is vast, and there are no traces of people for hundreds of miles. Tibetans have immature knowledge and do not know how to consider this. The number of people from the southeast is very few, which has aroused the coveting of the British. I have traveled to Tibet for more than ten years and feel the following points. I hope the government and the people of the country will pay attention to it immediately so that the western fortress will not be reduced to the second of the three northeastern provinces. 1) Consolidate the border defense; 2) Improve the knowledge of the local people so that they all have the spirit of development; 3) Seek convenience in transportation as soon as possible, such as building roads and installing telegraphs; 4) Encourage compatriots in the interior to go to the frontier to develop wasteland as soon as possible to enrich the strength of the frontier; 5) Pay attention to the drawbacks of ruling the people with religion and seek to liberate slaves as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e107">US Cotton Loan Does Not Hinder the Yarn Market <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Statement by Vice Minister Zou of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>National News Agency Local News, the reporter of National News Agency asked Vice Minister Zou, acting Minister of Finance, about the impact of the cotton and wheat loan signed by Minister of Finance Song Ziwen on behalf of the National Government with the United States on the Chinese yarn market. According to him, this loan should not have a negative impact on the yarn market, because the government signed this loan on the premise of national economic and social interests, and all yarn factories and their workers will be supported by it. When American cotton is transported to China in the future, it will be shipped in batches to ensure that the yarn factories are continuously supplied and will never flood the market. But so that the yarn factories can continue to work as usual, because all factories are currently worried about the limited cotton stock.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Daily Newspaper Association Will Host a Banquet for He Huaide Tomorrow Night <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>He Huaide Makes a Statement to Foreign Newspaper Reporters</p>
<p>Mr. He Huaide, Director of the US Scripps-Howard Newspaper Company and Chairman of the Associated Press, recently toured the Far East, passing through Japan to various places in the Northeast and Rehe to inspect the Japanese military's invasion situation. Then he passed through the front line of the two armies to Beiping, visited local officials, and met with old friends. After staying for a few days, he arrived in Shanghai by plane from Beiping the day before yesterday and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. The Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association, considering Mr. He as a major figure in the American press who is concerned about the situation in the Far East and has a lot of goodwill towards our country, has scheduled a banquet for him at Xinghualou on Fuzhou Road tomorrow night, and has invited reporters from various foreign newspapers in this city to accompany him to socialize.</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, He Huaide, the Chairman of the American Scripps-Howard Newspaper and the Associated Press, stayed at the Cathay Hotel after arriving in Shanghai yesterday (the 7th). The reporter visited him this morning and was told that he planned to stay in Shanghai for ten days. This trip to the West is to inspect the new developments in the Far East so that the Scripps-Howard newspapers can establish wise and constructive policies based on this. He also said that he may be the first American newspaper editor-in-chief to visit the Far East three times in his life. The Far East will be the center of world news in the next thirty years, and the commercial relationship between the United States and the Far East requires us to thoroughly understand the situation and know the trend of its development. Since the September 18th Incident in 1931, the newspapers of this department have not adopted a malicious policy towards Japan, but a constructive criticism policy, believing that we should not only hold a policy of loud outcry on the Far Eastern situation, but also have an aggressive attitude. He also said that the United States has never had a hostile attitude towards Japan. Since the Manchurian Incident, Japan has regarded the attitude of the United States as anti-Japanese, while China has regarded it as pro-China. In fact, neither is true. The real attitude of the United States is only unwilling to see the peace instruments being maintained destroyed. Years ago, Ford created a very simple machine, which was an adventure in transportation, but today, there is a fine Ford car. The United States regards the Non-Aggression Pact, the Washington Conference Treaty, and the League of Nations Covenant as peace instruments, just like that, unwilling to see them turn to ashes, but hoping that they will have the opportunity to progress and improve, just like the Ford car. However, the United States really made a mistake in 1931 and 1932. Its dealings with the Far East failed to keep pace with the League of Nations. Under the Hoover administration, its activities failed to correspond with other countries. Often, when other countries were actively seeking diplomatic methods to maintain peace in the Far East, the United States stood idly by. When other countries' interest waned, the United States suddenly rose up and jumped to the front line, reminiscent of the high school baseball war. The sudden rise of Hitler to power made Britain and France suddenly feel the need to maintain international covenants and abandon their empty cries. But at this time, Manchuria was already dead, resulting in the current situation. However, the entire situation in the Far East has changed greatly since my last visit, so I decided to come back for inspection to create a friendly and sympathetic news policy that can help each other.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Wang Yansong Returns to Shanghai to Petition for the Refund of Artificial Silk Tax <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to Reports, the Principle is Acceptable</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, was publicly recommended by the Chamber to lead representatives of the silk industry to petition in Beijing for the refund of the artificial silk import tax to protect the silk weaving industry. It is reported that Mr. Wang has returned to Shanghai after completing his public affairs yesterday morning. According to his statement to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, regarding the tax refund, after submitting opinions to various competent ministries, all believed that it was acceptable in principle, but the specific measures should be decided after consultation.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Huang Shaoxiong Has Not Left Shanghai <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Still Visited Hong'en Hospital Yesterday Morning, Guangdong Trip Will Definitely Be Postponed</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, Minister of Interior Huang Shaoxiong, who came to Shanghai from Beijing, has been repeatedly reported to have gone to Guangdong to meet with Chen (Mingshu) and Jiang (Guangnai) to explain the central government's armistice with Japan. Yesterday's newspaper reported that he had embarked on the Japanese Empress Wheel. The reporter went to Mr. Huang's residence yesterday afternoon to inquire and confirmed that Mr. Huang had not left Shanghai. Moreover, Mr. Huang visited his wife at Hong'en Hospital on West Avenue at 11 am yesterday to see her childbirth, and did not go out in the afternoon. It is heard that his trip to Guangdong will definitely be postponed, because Guangdong Province has understood the central government's armistice, and the 19th Route Army has also painfully returned to its troops, so there is no other problem.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Third District Party Department's Telegram to Feng Yuxiang <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Third District Party Department of the city telegraphed Feng Yuxiang yesterday, "To Mr. Feng Huanzhang of Zhangjiakou, Upon reading your telegram, we learned that you have taken office as the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army. Although your determination is commendable, we dare not agree with your actions. Because you have been elected as a member of the Central Committee of our Party and also hold a position as a member of the Central Government Committee, in terms of responsibility, it is precisely to enable you to fully expand your past ambitions and practice your anti-Japanese advocacy. Why must you rise up in Chahar at a time when the North China Armistice Agreement has just been signed, stealing the good name of the people's anti-Japanese movement, and abandoning your own responsibilities? This move has really made the people of the country confused, and we disapprove of it for you. Recently, you have even expelled the provincial committee and central government officials, conscripted troops, and coerced military expenses. Your actions have become increasingly perverse, and your remarks have become increasingly unscrupulous. How can this be what the People's Anti-Japanese Army should do? In recent days, the telegrams have said that you have colluded with the Red Russians and accommodated the Communist Party. If this endangers the foundation of the country, how can it be what the People's Anti-Japanese Army should do? If you are not insane, how can you be so absurd? You must know that at a time when the whole country is eager for peace, all soldiers who claim to be rebellious will eventually be spurned by the people of the country and will only be overthrown. Comrades of this association, grieving for the imminent demise of the country and lamenting your impending death, have sent a special telegram to warn you to rein in on the brink of the precipice. It is not too late. I hope you will consider it. Yu, on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Third District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Kuomintang of China, bows respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e112">Mediation on Behalf of the Fishery Construction Fee Collapses Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of Fish Merchants from Various Places Are Highly Emotional</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe Fishery Joint Association is Being Prepared for Today</p>
<p>The Fishery Construction Fee Collection Office of the Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry's Jiangzhe Region, because it forcibly ordered fish shops to collect construction fees on its behalf, aroused dissatisfaction among the fish shops in this city. The day before yesterday, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, Hu Diansun, and others came forward twice to mediate, but the official insisted on not giving in, and despite the repeated persuasion of Yu and others, it was ultimately ineffective, and the mediation was declared a failure. The representatives of fish merchants from various places in Shanghai were extremely emotional after hearing the news and decided to organize the Jiangzhe Fishery Joint Association. The following is a record of the process.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Participating Personnel <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The participants included representatives of fish merchants from various places in Shanghai, including Meng Lujiu from Hangzhou, Mao Anqing and Liang Dong from Ningbo, Rong Jinpin from Daishan, Fang Wenying, Hu Zhibing, Lu Quanshui, Xia Zubin, and Pi Quanrong from Shaoxing, as well as representatives from Jiaxing, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, and other places. Upon hearing the news of the breakdown in mediation, they convened an ad hoc meeting and organized the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Federation. In addition to the aforementioned personnel from various places, there were also representatives from the Shanghai Fresh Fish Trade Association, including Liu Tonghua, Zhang Zhenfang, and Zhang Zhisheng. They resolved to organize the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Federation, elected three standing committee members: Meng Lujiu, Hu Diansun, and Mao Anqing; appointed Liu Tonghua as general affairs, Hu Zhibing as secretary, and Zhang Zhenfang as publicity, to be responsible for handling the federation's affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Agreed Resolutions <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Meng Lujiu proposed an emergency motion stating that the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee was operating illegally and arbitrarily harassing fish merchants. They discussed how to deal with this and resolved to: (1) send telegrams to the National Government, various agencies, legal entities, and newspapers to explain the plight of fish merchants who could not possibly collect fisheries construction fees on behalf of the government; (2) publish a statement to all sectors about the Shanghai Fresh Fish Trade Association being subjected to undue pressure; (3) convene fish merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to jointly expand the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Federation; (4) send a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to request relief for fellow fish merchants and fishermen; (5) petition the Executive Yuan; (6) send letters to Xu Qiaqing, Zhuang Songfu, Huang Jinrong, Chen Guofu, Liu Hongsheng, Chu Huiseng, Chen Bulei, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, Xu Tingzuo, Chen Qihuai, and Zhu Huiqing, as well as the Ningbo and Dinghai Fellow-Townsmen Associations, requesting their joint assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Railway Department Prepares for Through Train Service between Shanghai and Beiping <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Seven Passenger Trains Prepared</p>
<p>Each Train with Ten Cars</p>
<p>The Railway Department issued an order to various railway bureaus stating: "To be followed. It has been noted that the capital ferry is nearing completion. All through-train matters have been discussed at a meeting convened by the Capital Ferry Through Train Preparation Committee of the Ministry, attended by relevant railway representatives. It was resolved to initiate through train service between Shanghai and Beiping, preparing seven passenger trains, each with ten cars, with the Jinpu Railway responsible for five trains and the Jinghu and Beining Railways each responsible for one train. However, since the Jinghu Railway has suffered repeated damage to its rolling stock since last year's incident, it is unable to provide its assigned train. Therefore, the train to be provided by the Jinghu Railway should be rented from the Beining, Pinghan, and Jiaoji Railways. The committee has telegraphed the Pinghan Railway Administration Committee, which has agreed to rent two passenger cars to the Jinghu Railway. The initiation of through train service between Shanghai and Beiping is extremely important. The Jinghu Railway is, in fact, unable to provide passenger cars due to repeated damage to its rolling stock. Apart from the two cars already borrowed from the Pinghan Railway, the remaining eight passenger cars should be provided by the Beining Railway with one first-class sleeping car, one first-class passenger car, one passenger baggage car, one dining car, and one postal baggage combination car; and the Jiaoji Railway should provide three third-class passenger cars for use. This is to be followed immediately."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Repercussions of the Railway Workers' Emergency Loan <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Representatives Elected to Petition</p>
<p>Request to Revise Three Regulations</p>
<p>Workers and artisans from various departments of the Songnan Zhanghuabang Railway General Factory, due to the severe losses suffered during the January 28th Incident, have been experiencing financial difficulties. They previously submitted a request to the Railway Department, asking it to order the return of their retirement savings (managed by the Welfare Committee), but this was not approved. Subsequently, the Savings Committee resolved to allocate 90,000 yuan from the public reserve fund as an interest-bearing loan for all members. However, upon receiving the "Trial Simple Regulations for Emergency Loans from the Jinghu, Huning, and Hangyong Railway Welfare Savings Association" the day before yesterday, and reading the twelve loan regulations, the workers expressed their opposition. Several articles were considered quite onerous, such as Article 2, which stated that members wishing to borrow must fill out three copies of the application form printed by the association, guaranteed by three members belonging to the same office (same room, same department), and certified by the heads of each department before being submitted to the association's accounting committee for review and processing. Article 9 stated that members who have not borrowed or have repaid their loans may act as guarantors, but during the guarantee period, they may not borrow from the association or act as a guarantor for a second person. According to these two articles, borrowing money by one person would deprive three other people of their borrowing rights, which is too restrictive and lacks universal treatment. What kind of emergency loan is this? Furthermore, Article 4 stated that only those who have served for more than five years can borrow from the association, in units of ten yuan, with a limit of two months' salary, and the total amount may not exceed one hundred yuan. However, the association still reserves the right to refuse payment or reduce the loan amount based on the circumstances. This article is even more contradictory to the needs of poor workers, because railway workers' salaries are based on seniority. The longer the service, the higher the salary grade; the shorter the service, the lower the salary grade. At a time when the cost of living is extremely high, low-level workers are often unable to make ends meet, let alone save money. To impose such strict regulations on emergency loans is to defeat the very purpose of emergency relief. After much discussion, they raised objections and elected Lin Jinlin, Zhu Gengsheng, and Zhang Guilin as representatives to go to Shanghai on Friday (today) to petition the association, requesting the revision of the regulations to provide relief and maintain the well-being of poor workers.</p>

<p>The entire city of Shanghai attached great importance to the group's mission to promote national goods inland. From 2 PM onwards, the Shanghai Citizens' General Federation, the Taxpaying Chinese Association, the General Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association, the National Goods Movement Association, the Penglai Market, the Overseas Chinese Federation, the Guohua Advertising Agency, the Special Zone Sulfur Bureau, the Zhengyi Society, the various road business federations, the various district citizens' federations, the various industry trade associations, the various factory trade unions, the national goods bazaars, the manufacturers' federations, the National Goods Compilation Society, and factory representatives such as Hu Fengxiang, Xu Tingzuo, Wang Honghui, Xu Genghua, Sun Daosheng, Tai Daren, Wang Zhaolin, Zhang Qingfa, Qian Lijun, Wu Yannong, Ge Futian, and more than five hundred other people, carrying flags and firecrackers, flocked to the wharf to bid farewell. Wang Jie'an and Chen Binghui, members of the standing committee, Yang Yucheng, the liaison committee, and Huang Mengtu, the secretary, welcomed them into the reception area, shook hands to express their gratitude, and offered tea and refreshments. As the clock struck four and the whistle blew, the representatives held a farewell ceremony, waving handkerchiefs and straw hats, setting off firecrackers and shouting cheers. The various colored flags fluttered in the wind, making a joyful farewell sound. All the members of the group clapped their hands and paid attention to express their gratitude. When the Yili Wheel raised anchor and set sail, the representatives rolled up their flags and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Xiong Xiling Pays Attention to Refugee Children's Education <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Red Swastika Society Replied Yesterday to Xiong Concurring</p>
<p>Three Ladies of Zhu, Chen, and Ning Donated Over a Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling, President of the World Red Swastika Society China General Association, previously noted that refugees in the society's various shelters had nothing to do all day except for two meals. This would be detrimental to their physical and mental health. Furthermore, many of the children had interrupted their schooling due to the war and had come to Beiping to seek refuge. To leave them in such a state of desolation would be a great pity. Therefore, he felt that it was imperative to provide adequate education for the women, children, and refugees in each shelter. Since the Guanghua Temple and Longquan Temple, the second and fifth shelters, had a large number of refugees, with over a thousand people, it seemed appropriate to conduct a pilot program in these two shelters first. The students who had dropped out of school should be taught separately according to their gender. The health of men, women, the elderly, and children should also not be ignored. Technical training should be provided based on their age, physical strength, and weakness. In addition, special maternity wards should be set up for refugee women to give birth, etc. Later, it was heard that Xiong had telegraphed the Beiping General Association, stating that all the instructions had been followed. The refugee school in the fifth Guanghua Temple shelter had been arranged and classes had begun. The refugee school in the second Longquan Temple shelter would also be established soon. There were many talented people among the refugees, including male and female teachers and martial arts instructors, who were willing to teach. Those refugees who did not wish to learn or were unable to learn would be assigned to other work to avoid sitting in the room and becoming pessimistic. The goal was to ensure that the refugees in the shelter forgot that they were war refugees and that the children who had dropped out of school would not abandon their studies. Yesterday, Mrs. Zhu Yazhi, Mrs. Ning Mengyan, and Mrs. Chen Xingya went to visit the society's fifth shelter in Guanghua Temple. They saw that the society's facilities for refugees were very thoughtful and that it paid attention to refugee education by establishing refugee schools. They praised this and donated one thousand yuan specifically for the relief of refugees, and another one hundred yuan for children's books, pens, paper, and stationery, as well as for maternity supplies. It was heard that the ladies had agreed to continue to donate their efforts in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Reason for Early Express Train Delay Yesterday Morning <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The eighth early express train from Shanghai to Beijing on the Jinghu Railway, which departed from Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday, arrived at the 120-kilometer mark between Zhoujingxiang and Wuxi at around 10:30 AM. The locomotive suddenly broke down, preventing it from continuing. The train driver immediately walked to Wuxi to report the incident. The Wuxi stationmaster detached the locomotive from a certain freight train and drove it to the scene to continue towing the express train. The delay was about two hours.</p>

<p>Ye Family Garden to Establish Sanatorium</p>
<h3 id="e123">Construction Plan and its Progress <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Mental Hospital to be Established Near the Garden</p>
<p>Board of Directors Postponed, President Yan in Charge</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen Hospital to be Constructed on Baseball Field</p>
<p>The news that the Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan had been donated to the National Shanghai Medical College as the Second Practical Sanatorium was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited President Yan Fuqing of the hospital yesterday, but he was out on official business, so Mr. Fang Zichuan received the reporter in his stead and described the process in detail, as well as future construction plans. These are now additionally reported above in order to inform the public of the community's welfare undertaking.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Progress Situation <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Fang, President Yan once served as a professor at St. John's University, and Mr. Ye Ziheng graduated from that school in his early years. Therefore, there was a teacher-student relationship, and the friendship was very deep after he left the school. Mr. Ye was the son of Mr. Ye Chengzhong. When the property was divided, he received an inheritance of about 400,000 yuan. Although he had been managing Shanghai and Hankou for years, he had not made much progress. However, he was still able to preserve the old property and had not incurred any losses. In February of this year, when President Yan and Mr. Ye met, they occasionally touched on current affairs and discussed the medical college and the plan to establish a practical hospital. Mr. Ye, feeling deeply for the country, had been thinking about undertaking public welfare projects to benefit the people. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he generously donated the Ye Family Garden, which occupies more than 80 mu and is worth over one million yuan. When the war in North China became tense, President Yan went north to handle relief matters. When he met with Mr. Ye in Tianjin again, the decision was formally made, but it was limited to the scope of the garden, as Mr. Ye owned the land on both sides of the garden.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Progress Plan <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>However, in order to preserve the inherent garden landscape, President Yan decided that the garden would only house a department of a tuberculosis sanatorium. Work has already begun to repair the original offices, houses, pavilions, and other structures in the garden, and it is expected to be completed by the end of this month, and will be opened first. Although the wards will be divided into grades, the price will be kept as low as possible. On the one hand, President Yan wrote to Mr. Ye a few days ago, asking him to donate another ten or more mu of open space next to the garden to build ordinary wards and neurological wards, as well as public rooms. The construction costs will be raised by the hospital itself. It is expected that a reply will be received within a week, and it is believed that Mr. Ye will readily agree without any problem. The motivation for establishing a special mental hospital is that there has never been such a facility in Shanghai, and that there is a Russian mental health expert named Bailey, who has extensive experience in the study of mental illness. He believes that most of the patients suffering from this disease are caused by excessive stimulation from environmental factors. If they can be placed in a pleasant place and allowed to nurture their bodies and minds in a good environment, the effect will be greater than the power of medicine. Therefore, in order to provide students with practical experience and supplement the city's facilities, it was decided to add the hospital. The equipment used in the sanatorium has been largely donated by the Rockefeller Foundation of the American oil magnate, and some has also been borrowed from the Central Health Department, so everything is very complete.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Board of Directors Postponed <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>After the sanatorium was established, it was originally planned to establish a board of directors to oversee all operations. However, Mr. Ye proposed that President Yan be solely responsible for managing it and that there was no need to establish a board of directors separately. Therefore, the board of directors was temporarily postponed. However, President Yan feared that such a public welfare undertaking could not be the responsibility of one person alone. Therefore, it would be established together with the first teaching hospital of the National Medical College when it was established.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Sun Yat-sen Hospital <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>As for the preparation and progress of the first teaching hospital, it has been planned for three years. President Yan, in order to commemorate Premier Sun Yat-sen, began planning it three years ago. The scale is very large, and the location is selected as the baseball field of the Chinese YMCA on Route Paul Henry in the French Concession, which occupies a total area of 100 mu. School buildings will be built on one side, and a hospital will be built on the other. The construction work is owned by the Rockefeller Foundation of the American oil magnate. A letter has been sent to request a donation, and it is expected that a reply will be received by the end of this month. The construction budget is one million yuan. Before April 18, President Yan had raised about 700,000 yuan from various sources. Once the foundation is determined, fundraising will be conducted to make up the one million yuan budget. The operating fund is also set at one million yuan. The surplus land from the construction of the school buildings and hospital will be used to build a beautiful residence, the income from which will be used to offset the one million yuan fund.</p>
<p>Russian Oil Dumped in China</p>
<h3 id="e128">Oil Merchants Compete by Lowering Prices <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Russian oil is being dumped in China, leading to price wars. This has had a tremendous impact on the American oil companies Mobil and Asiatic Petroleum and the British oil company Texaco, which previously controlled the oil rights in the Far East. At its peak, gasoline was sold for 1.20 yuan per gallon. Recently, in view of the continuous arrival of Russian oil and the resulting competition, the oil companies have had to lower prices in order to attract customers. Although Shell gasoline from Asiatic Petroleum is selling for 8.5 jiao per gallon, Russian oil sold by Guanghua Company is selling for only 7.65 jiao, which is 8.5 jiao cheaper. The fierce competition in kerosene is unprecedented. The reporter believes that kerosene is closely related to commerce and transportation and that if this situation continues, further price wars are inevitable. Therefore, the reporter visited Guanghua Kerosene Company, which sells Russian oil, to get the details.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Fierce Competition <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The reporter arrived at Guanghua Company and later met with Director Li of the Gasoline Department. He said that the company had been established for many years, but it had only signed a contract with the Russian Oil Products Corporation to sell Russian oil for about a year. The chairman is Xu Shiying, the general manager is Ke Juchu, and the capital is 3.5 million yuan. The so-called "competition period" has been going on for about four months for kerosene and two months for gasoline. However, during this competition period, the company's business has indeed been thriving. On average, Shanghai, including our company, has four major oil companies. The monthly sales of kerosene are about 12 million boxes (two cans per box), and gasoline sales reach 300,000 gallons. The proportion of kerosene sold by our company accounts for one-quarter, and gasoline accounts for one-sixth. It is indeed remarkable to be able to achieve this number in such a short period of time. As for whether prices will need to be lowered further in the future, it is difficult for anyone to predict. However, the contract between our company and the Russian Oil Products Corporation stipulates two points: (1) Regardless of whether kerosene is expensive or cheap, the oil sold by Guanghua must be cheaper than other oils. (2) No matter how much the price of oil falls or how low it is, the commission must still be maintained. With these provisions, it is no wonder that Guanghua oil is easy to sell, and Guanghua is happy to compete.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Setting Up a Depot and Filing a Lawsuit <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then asked about the company's establishment of a depot and its dealings with the Municipal Council. According to Director Li, the company had been selling kerosene for some time, and its oil drums were located in Gaoqiao, Pudong. Recently, in order to expand its business, it planned to build gasoline stations in the local area. When it first requested approval from the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council replied that it was not approved. Later, when it questioned the Municipal Council on the grounds that other companies were able to set up gasoline stations, the Municipal Council replied that it had the right to dispose of the matter. However, outside the prohibited area, other companies and domestic companies were still allowed to set up gasoline stations, but not along the road. The so-called prohibited area includes Avenue Edward VII and Bubbling Well Road. At that time, the company sent another letter to negotiate. The Municipal Council replied recently that it must still abide by its previous proposal. Therefore, the company pointed out that there were other companies' gas stations established in the so-called prohibited area. Since the company's request to establish gas stations was not approved, then other gas stations should also be demolished in order to be fair. Why should the Municipal Council treat them differently? Therefore, the company has hired lawyer Musu to file a lawsuit against the Municipal Council in the Consular Court. The proposed petition will be sent soon. A lawsuit arising from competition in kerosene is about to begin.</p>
<p>After the Increase in Customs Duties</p>
<h3 id="e131">Only Japanese Coal is Abundant <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Inferior Coal Arrives in Droves</p>
<p>Reduced Price Sales to Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>Since the increase in new customs duties on the 21st of last month, coal has been the most affected of the foreign goods imported into Shanghai. The import customs duty on coal, which used to be 2 yuan per ton, has now doubled to 4 yuan per ton. As the tax has increased, the price of coal has also risen. However, factories and shipping companies that need coal are facing business stagnation and decline. The sudden increase in the price of coal due to the increase in customs duties has greatly reduced their purchasing power. Coal dealers, on the other hand, have too much money tied up in ordering foreign coal to Shanghai. For example, to ship 3,000 tons of foreign coal to Shanghai, the manager has to fill out 40,000 yuan for customs duties and freight alone before the coal can arrive in port. Whether it can be sold is still a question. Therefore, since the 21st of last month, coal brokers in Shanghai have stopped ordering foreign coal. The Hongji, Keelung, Fushun, and other coal mining companies have also stopped shipping coal to China since the 21st of last month because of the high taxes and high prices and the sharp decrease in the demand in Shanghai. In these two weeks, the import of foreign coal has suddenly decreased sharply. Compared to before the increase in customs duties, the import volume is in a ratio of ten to one. Yesterday, the reporter met with people in the industry who said that the suspension of the import of foreign coal was fundamentally due to the increase in taxes and prices, which blocked the way forward. In addition, the market slump has led to the strange phenomenon of foreign coal disappearing today. This has not happened in the past ten years. Since the arrival of foreign coal has stopped in recent days, Kaiping's first, second, and third grade fines have become a necessity in the market. The price per ton is also at 10.78 yuan, and even loading is not enough to meet the demand, resulting in shortages. Japanese inferior coal has seized the opportunity to become active from this month and is being peddled everywhere, willing to reduce prices and only charge between 6 and 7 yuan per ton. In this week, the secret sales of inferior coal to various factories and ships in the middle and upper classes are said to have reached between 300,000 and 400,000 tons. The selling price is less than 7 yuan per ton, which is 3 yuan cheaper per ton compared to the market price. Moreover, all of them are delivered in Shanghai. Not a few Chinese shipping companies secretly purchased the coal. However, Mr. Chen Juntong of Zhongwei Company did not want to be greedy for small gains. In the midst of the activity of inferior coal and the disruption of foreign goods, he spared no expense to order 10,000 tons of Chinese coal, Grade One and Grade Two fines, for the use of commercial ships. This is commendable. Compared to hiring Japanese crew members and using purely Japanese coal on national ships, the difference between the two is really immeasurable. Now, unless there are orders, Hongji, Keelung, and Fushun coal are not shipped to Shanghai. The foreign coal currently being sold on the market is all taxed in the past.</p>
<p>Lu Caibao's Unresting Spirit</p>

<p>=Teacher-Student Lewdness Causes Bloody Case=</p>
<p>=Cai Bao Has a Spirit, Indeed Captures the Murderer=</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month at 2:15 AM, an unidentified male corpse was found in front of No. 331 Kangti Road in the French Concession, having been hacked to death with an axe. Central Police Station patrol officers Nos. 533 and 700 discovered the corpse. Upon inspection, the body was covered in axe wounds, with 23 cuts, and eight stab wounds from a small knife. An axe with a broken wooden handle was found on the ground about one door away from the body, facing west. The detective took the axe back to the police station for evidence. The body was transported to the morgue. As no family members were found, the case was reported to the Second Special Court Prosecutor for examination. It was ordered that the body be buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. The French police arrested an accomplice in the case, who was sent to court yesterday for interrogation. The case arose from adultery and is quite complex. The following is a record of the causes of the tragedy, and the solving of the case.</p>
<h3 id="e133">A Section of Rice Letter Account <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The following is the interrogation: The deceased, Lü Caibao, was 22 years old, from Ninghai, Taizhou, Zhejiang. His father, Lü Arong, is currently 55 years old and lives at No. 14 Yixing Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei. He makes bamboo and rattan chairs for a living. He has two sons, the elder being Caibao, and the younger still young. Caibao was married. He used to be a boatman, but recently lost his job and has been unemployed for a long time, falling into the lower classes. Several years ago, he was a local gangster in Deshan Lane, French Avenue, and took Han Kou Asi as his "old man". He also took in apprentices, but those he took in were all</p>

<p>Deshan Lane is filled with opium dens, and good and bad are mixed together. Wang Xiqing, a deceased Tongzhou native who lived at No. 7 in the lane, (the Japanese all called him Mr. Wang. He used to be a police officer, then resigned and sold loans and red pills, and rented houses in the lane, subletting them to opium dens, making a huge fortune,) his eldest son, Wang Damao, who is 20 years old this year, took Caibao as his "old man" two or three years ago. Recently, the houses in Deshan Lane were renovated, and his group of teachers and apprentices moved to the Dongxinqiao Street area to be gangsters, specializing in,</p>
<h3 id="e135">Extortion and Blackmail <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Wang Damao even committed adultery with Lü's wife, which Lü discovered, causing him great anger. He wanted to kill Damao, but Lü's wife sent a letter to Damao, who fled and avoided disaster. After a long time, Lü's anger subsided, and he put it out of his mind. However, Wang Damao was always afraid to see Lü, fearing he would be poisoned. There was also Wei Chunrong, who was about 20 years old and also Lü's apprentice. He was familiar with Gu Shaoying's sixteen-year-old eldest daughter, Qiaozi (born in the ninth month of the lunar calendar, not yet fifteen years old), who lived upstairs in the Yongtaihe cigarette paper shop at No. 20 Dongxinqiao Street and was from Zhenjiang. The girl's father used to be a broker at the gold exchange, but lost his job due to losses and now makes a living as a peddler. However, Lü Caibao saw that his apprentice Wei Chunrong had a beautiful lover and sighed at his inferiority, and therefore could not help but</p>

<p>Wanting to seduce her. He tried to lure her in every way possible but failed, so he incited his wife to lure Gu's daughter into his hands, causing her to be defiled. Wei soon learned that his lover had been defiled by Lü, and his jealousy burned. He hated that the "old man" was inhumane and shameless, performing incestuous and obscene acts, violating the rules of the gang. From then on, he had the idea of killing Lü to remove the enemy from his sight. However, he hated that he could not do it alone, so he thought of his brother Wang Damao, who was also the "old man's" enemy, and discussed it with Wang, further instigated by Lü's wife from the side.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Two Planned and Succeeded <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Gathering six or seven apprentices and friends, at a little after one o'clock on the night of the twenty-eighth of last month, during a heavy rain, they lured Lü Caibao to a remote place on Kangti Road, where they ambushed him with axes and sharp blades, killing him. After the incident, Wang Damao immediately eloped with Lü's wife, and Wei also explained to Gu Qiaozi the process of killing Lü to vent his hatred, intending to flee with Gu. But the girl refused, and Wei did not dare to force her, and left alone to avoid disaster. After this case occurred, the police were unable to investigate for a while due to the unidentified body. Then, the fingerprints of the deceased were checked, and only his name was known. He had been sentenced to six months in prison in the Public Concession for a demolition case, but it was still difficult to find clues. Unexpectedly, the deceased had a spirit, and his ghost lingered, even attaching itself to his friend, Mr. Jia, and using his mouth to recount</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Details of the Tragic Death <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>And the names and number of murderers, vividly. The friend told Lü's father, and his father searched for his daughter-in-law without a trace. He then went to the police station to identify the photos, which turned out to be his son Caibao. He then visited Wei Chunrong's lover, Gu Qiaozi, to inquire about the situation. Qiaozi truthfully told everything without reservation. Lü's father immediately reported to the police station, requesting the arrest of the murderer. Through the detectives of the special agency, Jin Jiulin, Zhang Ziying, Zhou Bingcheng, Zhou Yaoting, Bao Tan Qinyouyu, etc., they began to investigate, spending three days of hard work, and finally learned that the accomplice, Jiang Yinlong, a Suzhou native (21 years old, son of Jiang A'gen, owner of the Laizhengxing razor shop at No. 41 Mofang Street), was hiding inside No. 134 Dongzilaike Street. So at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday,</p>

<p>Lü Arong, and the witness Gu Qiaozi, they rushed to arrest Jiang, brought him to the police station and took him into custody. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where the presiding judge Wang Gangxu and clerk Fang Mengzhou took their seats for the trial. The bailiffs brought Jiang to stand before the court, his eyes red, his head bowed and speechless. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case and the process of arresting the defendant, and prosecuted according to Article 284 of the Criminal Law, and said that the police station still needed to investigate the case in detail, and that the principal offender and accomplices were on the run and had not been arrested, requesting a postponement of the trial. The</p>

<p>Was presented to the court. Bao Tan Qin Youyu also reported on the situation of arresting the defendant. Then, the father of the deceased, Lü Arong, stated that he did not know about his son's murder at the time, and that the body was collected by the charity hall. He only learned the details after inquiring with Gu Qiaozi. He reported to the police station to arrest the defendant and requested redress, and presented a photo of his son, daughter-in-law, and three young children to the court. The witness Gu Qiaozi was sent to court by the police station for questioning. According to her, she knew Lü Caibao, and Caibao's wife was having an affair with Wang Damao. Caibao learned of this and wanted to kill Damao, so Damao killed Caibao first and took his wife to the pier. I heard this from Caibao's apprentice, Wei Chunrong, because Chunrong</p>
<h3 id="e141">Does Not Have Good Intentions Towards Me <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>He was willing to tell me. He said that the murderers were Yinlong, Ahai, Yuansheng, Beiqi, etc. and a friend. He wanted me to go with him, but I refused, and he went alone. Interrogating Jiang Yinlong, he confessed that he was sharpening a razor in the shop that day. Wang Ahai came to invite me to go to Xieqiao to play. I went with him. When I walked to Kangti Road, I saw Caibao dead on the ground, with seven or eight people standing there. Damao and Chunrong forced me to stab him once. They said that if I didn't stab him, I would leak, and they would beat me to death. Forced and helpless, Chunrong handed me a fruit knife, and I stabbed him once, in the lower body. I can't remember clearly now. By the time the interrogation reached this point, it was past 1:30 PM. The court ordered a postponement of the trial to June 22, and the defendant was remanded in custody. Gu Qiaozi was temporarily detained at the police station.</p>

<p>=The Supreme Court Orders Compliance=</p>
<p>=Major Errors to Be Sent to the Department for Review=</p>
<p>The Procuratorate of the Local Court of this city yesterday received an instruction from the Procuratorate of the Jiangsu High Court, which was transferred from the Procuratorate of the Supreme Court, stating that since the promulgation of the Amnesty Ordinance, there have been many errors in the cases of reduced sentences tried by courts in various provinces. This Procurator has filed extraordinary appeals to correct them, and the judgments have been published in the Gazette of the Judicial Yuan. However, as time has passed, such erroneous cases have not decreased. The number of extraordinary appeals filed by prosecutors in various provinces has been increasing day by day, and they are all being filed case by case, which is both labor-intensive and uneconomical. Therefore, in addition to issuing orders, the Prosecutor is ordered that in cases of reduced sentences, except for major errors, which should still be sent to this Department for review, those with similar sentencing periods or that are clearly not detrimental to the defendant, should not be filed for extraordinary appeals to save the trouble of paperwork, and all subordinates should be ordered to comply. Having received this, in addition to issuing separate orders, the Prosecutor is ordered to comply.</p>
<p>Sun Peijia Experienced Hardships Since Childhood</p>

<p>=Her Husband Actually Commits All Kinds of Evil=</p>
<p>=Sun Can Hardly Endure and Asks for Divorce=</p>
<p>Sun Peijia, a woman from Guilin, Guangxi, is 36 years old this year. She lost her parents in childhood. A British female missionary, Miss Heng, saw that she was lonely and helpless and took her in, bringing her to Shanghai. She first studied at the Xinde Society Church School on Jessfield Road, and then changed to the Bayijiang Ai Yu Girls' School. After she graduated, she was assigned to teach at the Xinde Society. In September of the tenth year of the Republic of China, through the introduction of a Mr. Zhang, she married Sun Boying, a native of Haining. Later, she learned that Sun was a rascal with no legitimate occupation. Sun also deceived Miss Sun, saying that he was working in the police station as a police officer with a monthly salary of thirty yuan and that he hoped to be promoted in the future. However, Sun Boying completely ignored household expenses, which were entirely supported by his wife's teaching income. In September of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, Sun Boying was arrested for impersonating a police detective, illegally searching opium in a resident's home on the grounds of extortion. He was sentenced to one year in prison by the court. During this period, he was also reprimanded by his in-laws. After Boying completed his sentence and was released from prison, he had an affair with another woman and often extorted money from his wife. Peijia resented her bad fate and introduced him to jobs, but he was not content in any position. Unexpectedly, in recent times, Sun Boying, in addition to ordering Peijia to borrow money everywhere for his squandering, also used Peijia's name to swindle gold and silver ornaments and silver dollars from her classmates, causing great damage to her reputation. Such behavior was intolerable and it was impossible to grow old together. She hired Lawyer Yu Enliang to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court, requesting that she be granted a divorce. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Hu opened the court for questioning. The defendant could not be served because the address was unknown, so he did not appear in court. The plaintiff, Sun Peijia, explained the situation. The judge ordered that the case be adjourned and the defendant be summoned again for questioning.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Transportation believes that since the current postage stamps have been re-printed with the portraits of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other martyrs, the stamps on postcards should also be handled in the same way to maintain consistency. It has ordered the Shanghai Postal Administration to re-print with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait. After receiving the order, the Bureau has submitted the money model to the Ministry for review. The Ministry believes that the face value and zygomatic纹lines of the portrait made by the model are too thick and not very elegant. It has ordered to re-make and instructed to hand over to the Peiping Printing Bureau for printing as soon as possible, so that it can be issued as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Public Works Bureau Did Not Propose Setting Up a Management Agency</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, the National News Agency, Nanjing, reported that the Concession authorities had proposed to jointly establish a central agency for the management of radio broadcasting with the municipal government, and that various broadcasting stations had not expressed opposition to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, and were very grateful for the technical guidance and expert supervision of the Ministry of Communications International Telecommunications Bureau.</p>
<p>According to the announcement released by the Information Office of the Public Works Bureau on the 8th, the Public Works Bureau has never proposed to establish any management agency for this matter. Because there are many conflicts in broadcasting in this port, some representatives of radio stations feel that considerable management is necessary. The representatives have prepared a letter of opinion and submitted it to Mr. Feixin Dun, President of the Public Works Bureau, detailing the difficulties faced by the radio stations. President Fei is currently considering this letter in detail. In the near future, President Fei may discuss this matter with other local authorities in this port to explore the possibility of establishing a coordination to remedy the chaos in broadcasting.</p>

<p>=Lied About Being Shot During Adultery=</p>
<p>=Deported After Investigation=</p>
<p>The Guangda cigarette paper shop opened by Mao Guangfa at No. 26 Ouyang Road, Cigarette Bridge, Zhabei, at 10:15 pm on the 6th of this month, was suddenly broken into by four robbers. Two robbers each took out a pistol to threaten them not to make a sound. Just as they were about to start searching, shop assistant Fan Yongji shouted for help. Police officer Cui Guanjin of No. 1729 nearby heard the sound and came. The robbers knew things were bad and fled empty-handed before they could rob anything. Officer Cui immediately fired a shot and chased after them. The robbers also turned around and fired back three shots. The officer fired two more shots. As a result, the robbers still escaped and could not be found. He reported the situation to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for investigation. Until 6:15 am the next morning (the 7th), a wounded man was suddenly sent to the Baolong Hospital on Baike Road by his friend. After examination by the doctor, it was found that the injured person had a gunshot wound in his left chest, and the bullet had pierced through his back, which was suspicious. While treating him, he reported to the Xinzha Police Station and sent Detective Yang Feizhang and Bao Tan Yang Youshan to investigate. According to the injured person, his name was Wang Youren, 39 years old, from Nanjing. He was injured by Lao Guo, who lived on Bansongyuan Road in the South City. The reason was that his wife had an affair with Lao Guo. Yesterday, he learned that his wife was having a secret meeting with Guo, so he went to catch them in the act, but was shot and injured by Guo. The friend's name was Xie Hua, 24 years old, from Anhui. At about 1:00 am the night before, I was walking near the Great World when I met a Mr. Xu, who said that his friend Wang Youren was injured and asked me to send him to the hospital. I met Wang on a rickshaw on Beile Road and accompanied him to Baolong Hospital. I don't know how Renwang was injured, etc. Detective Yang obtained the confession, and whether the confession was reliable or not remains to be investigated. It was later learned that in the morning of the same day, more than 4:00 am, a gunfight occurred between a patrol officer and robbers near Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road in the Public Concession, and it was suspected that Wang et al. were involved. After detailed investigation, Wang et al. were not related. The police station directly called the French police station and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to inquire. It was only learned that Wang was attempting to rob the Guangda cigarette paper shop on Cigarette Bridge and was shot and injured by the police. Xie was brought to the police station, and a police was ordered to go to Baolong Hospital to guard Wang. Because Wang's injuries were serious, he stayed in the hospital for recuperation. Yesterday morning, only Xie Hua was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the details of the incident and did not object to the Public Security Bureau's transfer of Wang and Xie. Then Zhang Pengyi, a patrol officer from the Third Division of the Fifth District of Zhabei, filed a case requesting deportation. Judge Qian Wenji approved the transfer of Wang and Xie to the officer for trial.</p>

<p>| Shaoqin Admits to Misunderstanding |</p>
<p>Doctor Wu Shaoqin sued his son Daonan for attempted assassination. The Nanhui County court found that Daonan did not have the incestuous act of stabbing his father with a knife and acquitted him. Shaoqin refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyers Wang Fushang and Ma Leman to appeal to the Shanghai Local Court. In the court, he falsely accused his daughter, Ms. Weng Chen, of instigating the case. After investigation, it was found that the case was entirely due to Shaoqin's misunderstanding. Wu Shaoqin has always been stubborn and believed rumors, resulting in family lawsuits and discord between relatives. After the judge's earnest persuasion, he said that the love between father and son must be natural, and do not turn trivial matters into misfortune. Wu Shaoqin suddenly realized that he did not want his father and son to face each other in court, and voluntarily applied to withdraw the appeal. Chen, who is a honest businessman, felt deeply aggrieved by the unfounded accusation and filed a criminal lawsuit. After persuasion from local gentry, Wu Shaoqin also admitted to Wu Hui and obtained Chen's understanding. The case has been discontinued.</p>

<p>| Zhang Jishi from Taicang wrote |</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a modern normal school student, and I am a skeptical person. Whenever I encounter something, I assume that I can understand it, and then I'm done with it. If I have any doubts, I either ask the teacher or discuss it with my classmates. Sir, today I have something to ask about. This matter is not extremely important, nor is it something that teachers and classmates cannot answer. It is truly because the more they answer for me, the more my doubts increase. Therefore, I have no choice but to ask you!</p>
<p>Last night, I received a letter from an old classmate of mine who is studying in Suzhong Province. At the end of the letter, he signed himself as Xiaoman. He is not only my old classmate but also my old fellow townsman. After reading a small section of this letter, my questions arose.</p>
<p>A passage in his letter said, "Since Mei Mei abandoned me three months ago, and I have also suffered from being cheated in love by a female scammer (fortunately, old friends are just talking about it), my spirit has been decadent, and my behavior has become increasingly eccentric. Recalling the past, I often pushed books away and wept all day long, so I changed my name to 'Canshou' and 'Xiaoman,' taking the meaning of taking away what I loved."</p>
<p>Sir, regarding this small passage, I suddenly have many doubts. Now I will briefly write a few points below:</p>
<p>(1) We young students, in the current environment, can we still talk about the word "love"? And are these tasks that young people should be rushing to do now?</p>
<p>(2) Is it the spirit and will that young students should have if they become spiritually decadent and their behavior becomes increasingly eccentric because of a valueless setback?</p>
<p>(3) "Often pushing books away and weeping all day long," is this love more important than reading, especially in the current situation, and under the saying "Saving the country requires reading, and reading is saving the country"?</p>
<p>(4) Is this kind of person a decadent, weak person who cannot stand in the current environment in the current environment?</p>
<p>Sir, I hope you will answer me in detail, and at the same time, you can also give Canshou a compass in the vast ocean of confusion. I am extremely grateful!</p>
<p>Answer: We only regard love as the same as eating and dressing, but there is a difference: If you don't eat for a day, you will be hungry; if you don't wear clothes for a day, you will be cold, but you will never die if you don't fall in love for three to five years. Now that the country is destroyed and the family is ruined, a group of people with power and money are promoting entertainment there, naturally with other intentions. However, if you, as a group of young people, are truly unwilling (in action, not just in words) to be slaves of a fallen country, you must unconditionally put aside this useless activity and do the work of saving the country. If you truly encounter female warriors with the same aspirations in the work of resisting Japan and anti-imperialism, and you unite with each other to fight together, advancing shoulder to shoulder and dying side by side in the face of the enemy, that is a real man. This is the first point.</p>
<p>If you suffer a little setback, you will become spiritually decadent, and your behavior will become eccentric. This kind of young people are called "three-year-old elders." What "spirit and will" can they talk about? This is the second point.</p>
<p>"Pushing books away and weeping" is what is called "blood flowing from the eyes and ashes forming in the heart," which is of course unacceptable. Generally speaking, "reading" is naturally more important than "love." However, if you take what you quoted, "Saving the country requires reading, and reading is saving the country," which is a new metaphysics, then reading and love are actually about the same, half a catty on one side and eight taels on the other. Because talking about love must still carry a little emotion. Today, when the enemy has entered our house, we are still superstitious about the empty theory of "saving the country by reading," which is truly irrelevant. "The son of a thief," "destroying your country," "will the ghosts of the Ruo'ao clan not be hungry?" Japanese imperialists will inevitably sneer at us, saying: "Slave! This is the third point. What is the need to say about the fourth question? No further answer!</p>

<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>The progress of human civilization is often uneven and contradictory. For example, Shanghai people today know how to use airplanes to save the country, but last year's newspapers still reported that an airplane crashed in a mountain in Liling, and the villagers burned incense and kowtowed to it. The recognition of the same airplane differs so much. It is easy to explain that villagers in the countryside have shallow knowledge, a low level of culture, and naturally more superstition. However, the same goal of saving the country leads some to use airplanes, while others go to the Shuilun Buddhist ceremony to pray for peace, or to the patriotic gathering to try to avert national disaster. It is not easy to understand that logic. But this does not mean that patriotic gatherings cannot save the country, or that Buddhist ceremonies are useless for peace. A modern woman with high heels might go to the City God Temple to burn incense and pray for a child, and it might be quite effective as long as her husband does not die. However, even today, superstition can still grip the minds of our masters and madams so tightly, which shows the great power of religion. No wonder that while the national crisis is raging, temples in some places are being hastily renovated, and Buddhist statues in some places are busy being gilded. And recently, Shanghai's masters and madams, after "a hundred years," are also keen on having monks and Taoists putting on a funeral procession, with a lineup that stretches for one or two streets, believing that it is a glorious farewell after death.</p>
<p>It is said that religion originated from primitive people's inability to understand "nature" but their need to rely on it for survival, leading them to doubt, then to marvel, then to worship, and then to pray. This mentality has become today's City God, the Bodhisattva, the gathering for national salvation. But humankind today is no longer the same as humankind in the past, and the relationship with "nature" is vastly different: in the past, they had to eat raw meat and drink blood, but today they can sit in a car and comfortably go to Da San Yuan or Yizhi Xiang to eat Chinese and Western cuisine. Even if it cannot be the same for everyone, at the very least, it does not come down to taking raw wild things and feeding them directly into the mouth. The ability to recognize "nature" is of course a million times greater than that of primitive people. However, why is it that the tricks of the barbarian era can still remain until now, and never decline, like the pigtail worn by a coolie on his head, shamelessly exposed in the street? It is difficult to explain this logic. You should know that those who are the most superstitious are often those with the highest level of culture and knowledge in society, who must ride in cars when they go out, live in foreign houses when they enter, eat rich and thick meals, and employ the most "natural" power. Stupid men and women can only follow behind them, kowtowing and bowing.</p>
<p>Going to fortune-telling or character analysis behind the City God Temple or near the Great World, what they are praying for is not rain for the world, but rather seeking success in their careers, and hope for prosperity. In between, the relationship with "nature" has decreased, and the prayer for social affairs has increased. It is not difficult to know that the psychology of religious superstition is now not only the meaning of dealing with "nature."</p>
<p>Those in power want to use this mentality to solve personnel problems, and those below can only use this mentality to hope for luck. The problem of religious superstition cannot be as easily solved as the great writer Goethe said: with "science," "science," and "art," there is no need for religion. Simply changing "nature" is not enough for the progress of human civilization.</p>
<h3 id="e165">View of Death <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>About two or three years ago, Liang Yuchun raised the question of the view of death, hoping that everyone would discuss it, but scholars seemed to hate that Liang forgot their "truths that they fought hard for," so they did not respond, so that there is still "death" without "view," or there is "view" but not for "death."</p>
<p>People all know, but do not often think about, on the edge of life, on the other side of the universe, there is "death." From the womb to the tomb is such a short road, Gao Lei (Abraham Cowley 1618-1667) once called it a Pas de Vie, like Pas de Calais; yes, life is like a narrow strait, we cannot predict the arrival of death, maybe every day can be our last day! Death gives us the opportunity to see our own faces clearly, and we must also see the face of death.</p>
<p>Death should not be terror. Half a year ago, my close friend suffered from heart disease. On a quiet winter afternoon, quietly, he left this world: not half a word, nor a trace of pain, he just lay quietly; the eternal farewell made me go from sobbing to wailing, but I believe that death is not terrible.</p>
<p>But I have also seen the hideous death. A wounded coolie in the neighborhood groaned in pain day and night, suffocating, struggling, until he took his last breath; his whole body convulsed at the time of his death, his eyebrows locked, his mouth open, clearly a painful phenomenon.</p>
<p>But what the peaceful death and the hideous death gave me was the same skull.</p>
<p>Everyone is a skull, but what does the skull imply to us? Perhaps there are still thoughts of wealth and loss existing in the hollow head, perhaps the love and hatred of the world are still hanging in the exposed teeth, or perhaps everything is reduced to nothing, the universe forgets him, and he forgets the universe.</p>
<p>We are still holding on to this life and studying death from the standpoint of life. We cannot find news of the country of death. In the mouth of the witch doctor,</p>
<p>What we get is just a situation similar to the human world, these ghosts (if there are any) are dreaming human dreams, speaking human words, and not the real news of the country of death.</p>
<p>Yuchun is dead; maybe he is still studying this issue, but he can no longer tell us his insights.</p>
<p>We are all mortals who will die. If we say "death lives on in the memory of the living," then I can finish here.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Random Remarks from Qulu, Part 40 <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Zhuangyuan (Foreign Graduate)</p>
<p>There is a commentary in the first issue of Min Bao titled "How Ugly is Jin Bangping," which roughly said that the Manchu government used its means of controlling people's hearts, so there was the act of the palace examination for students studying abroad. Jin Bangping was the one who sorrowfully initiated it. On the birthday of the Manchu chief, the Manchu slave Yuan Shikai held a grand banquet in Tianjin, inviting consuls from various countries to celebrate the Manchu chief's birthday. He also gathered students from Tianjin to celebrate. Thousands of people attended on that day. Shikai personally encouraged the students in the language of slaves. When the meeting was about to end, suddenly one person went on stage and said to the crowd, "Do you all know me? I graduated from studying in Japan, and I am grateful for being awarded the position of Compiler of the Hanlin Academy. I am not worth mentioning, but the Holy Grace is so great, enough to show that the court values students. I encourage you all, don't worry about not being like me." Everyone looked at him, and it was Jin Bangping. Not long after the meeting ended, Bangping rode in a sedan carried by four people, with two plaques listing his titles, one for "Granted Jinshi Background" and the other for "Appointed Compiler of the Hanlin Academy," parading ostentatiously through the city. People all looked sideways and whispered to each other, "This is the foreign graduate!" It is noted that Min Bao was first published in 1905, which is the 31st year of Guangxu. More than eight years later, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was destroyed. Alas! Cities sometimes become lakes, and seas sometimes become fields; floating clouds in the sky are like white clothes, and in a moment they change into blue dogs; who among the reporters of Min Bao would know what would happen thirty years from now? In the past, Jin Bangping did not seem to be worth despising, but now the rampant people are everywhere, and they are not limited to students studying abroad. The one who created Jin Bangping was the Manchu Qing government. What is there to blame in Jin Bangping? If the reporters of Min Bao were still alive, would they also agree with me? The collected edition of Min Bao is titled "Psychology Textbook" to avoid the ears and eyes of the Manchu Qing government. At that time, the Manchu Qing government was too violent to approach, but where is it now? I sigh three times and put down my pen for it.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Zizhan, who is now focusing all his efforts on a certain work and has no time for other things. The Random Remarks from Qulu will end here.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Seven Days in a Hospital Bed <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Xiong Xiang</p>
<p>May 19th</p>
<p>I moved into the hospital this afternoon. When I came for a diagnosis this morning, the doctor said: It's really fortunate that I haven't died yet. I repeated this to Ming Ge when I got back, and Ming Ge was startled and immediately forced me to stay in the hospital. But I was a little unwilling. First, I had to leave my Ming Ge, who was like my hands and feet, and second, staying in the hospital would increase his burden. Besides, it's so lonely in the hospital!</p>
<p>May 20th</p>
<p>I woke up at about 2 AM. I had a dream that was quite unpleasant. The person I resolved to forget inexplicably came to my mind again. It was very uncomfortable. In the dream, I heard that Liansheng and Duan Jie had gotten married. I went to see Sister Chun, but she wasn't home. I took the opportunity to visit the newly married Duan Jie. Duan Jie only told me to leave. Liansheng hurriedly ran over to hold me back, not letting me go. His attitude was very ugly. After waking up, the dream was still vivid, and it was very painful. I just wanted to find a knife to cut the pain out of my heart.</p>
<p>I waited from 5 AM until Ming Ge finally staggered in at 2 PM. Jing Ge followed behind him. Now I have finally tasted the pain of longing, which is even worse than usual when I'm sick.</p>
<p>This is my first time staying in a hospital. As soon as I came in, I learned that I had to call the nurses "Miss," otherwise, I would be blamed. I never thought that there would be such a noble title here.</p>
<p>There are six beds in the room. Including me, there are five patients lying in them. One is from Shaoxing, one is from Hubei, one is from Jiangxi, and one is from Guangdong. We call each other by our place of origin. My neighbor is from Guangdong. I heard that she had surgery, so her illness is the most serious. She lies silently all day long. I am the least sick among the five, so I am also the most active. I can get out of bed and walk around, and I can do everything myself without having to ask the nurses for help. Presumably because it's a third-class ward, the nurse only comes to make the bed, check the temperature, and give medicine once a day. The Guangdong woman's copper bell at the head of the bed often rang for a long time without anyone appearing. Sometimes I hear voices from the next room, and the patients quickly shout, "Oh, Miss..." The response is sometimes none, sometimes: "Okay, I'll be there in a minute." As a result, they either come, or they don't come at all. The patients often shout until they cry, but outside, you can often hear the laughter of the Misses and the tea boy. I can't figure out how the people in the hospital are trained to be so cruel. The hospital is really like a battlefield. However, in the first-class wards next door, you never hear the patients calling. Humanity's cruelty to humanity also has first-class and third-class distinctions.</p>
<p>May 21st</p>
<p>Ming Ge can only accompany me for half a day. He was quite reluctant to leave. After he left, the people in the room started a discussion. The Shaoxing woman said, "You two are very close, very intimate." The Hubei woman said, "The closer you are, the more diseases you will have." They are mostly people who work in factories, and no one comes to visit them all day long. The hospital is like society. Most of the people who are sick in the third-class ward are lonely and helpless people. No matter where you go in this society, the classes are clearly divided and will not be confused. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e168">Red Carrot Whiskers <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— By Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Plum</p>
<p>After tossing and turning on the feather bed for a while, the godfather said, "Beast, are you asleep?"</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers: No, Godfather.</p>
<p>Godfather: I'm not asleep either. I'm awake. If you'd like, let's go catch worms together. "That's a good idea," said Red Carrot Whiskers.</p>
<p>They both jumped out of bed, got dressed, lit a lantern and ran into the garden.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers held the lantern, while the godfather held a tin box containing half a box of wet mud. The box stored some fishing worms. The surface was covered with a layer of moist moss, so the worms would never run out. After a whole day of rain, the harvest was very considerable.</p>
<p>"Be careful not to step on the worms," he said to Red Carrot Whiskers, "walk gently. If I weren't afraid of catching a cold, I'd rather take off my shoes and walk in socks. As soon as they hear a little noise, the worms will dart into their holes. But we can only catch them when they are far from their holes. We have to grab them suddenly and hold them a little tighter to prevent them from slipping away. If half of their body has already burrowed into the hole, then let them go: otherwise, you will break them. And broken worms are of no use at all. And they will also cause other worms to rot, and refined fish will not bother to eat this kind of rotten worm. Some fishermen are stingy with their worms, which is really wrong. If you don't use whole, live, wriggling worms, you won't catch good fish. Because the worms are moving in the water, the fish think they are going to escape, so they rush to swallow them without hesitation."</p>
<p>"I can never catch them," Red Carrot Whiskers grumbled, "my fingers get dirty with their disgusting saliva."</p>
<p>Godfather: Worms are not disgusting. Worms are the cleanest things in the world. They only eat dirt, and if we squeeze them, they will just turn back into dirt. As for me, I could put them in my mouth and eat them.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers: As for me, I'd rather let you eat them. Please eat them and show me.</p>
<p>Godfather: These worms are a bit too big. And you have to fry them first, then spread them on bread to eat. But small ones, like the worms inside plums, I can eat raw.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers: Right, I know. That's why I make my family dislike you, especially Mom, who feels like throwing up when she thinks of you. As for me, I agree with you but don't imitate you, because you have a good temper and we get along very well.</p>
<p>He raised the lantern, climbed down a plum tree, and picked some plums. He kept the good ones for himself and handed the worm-eaten ones to his godfather. The godfather took them, swallowed them whole with the pit, and said:</p>
<p>"These are a few of the best tasting ones."</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers: Ah! Even I want to put them in my mouth and eat them like you. But I'm afraid my mouth will smell bad, and I'm afraid Mom will scold me when she hugs and kisses me.</p>
<p>"There's no smell at all," said the godfather, breathing on his godson's face.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers: Really. Your mouth only smells of smoke. I can smell that right away. Godfather, I like you very much, but if you didn't smoke, I would like you even more.</p>
<p>Godfather: Beast! Beast! Smoking is good for your health.</p>

<p>丨Students on Strike Have Resumed Classes Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th) Students in Beijing who went on strike to protest the regular examination resumed classes completely on the 7th. However, some students still advocate a second strike.

<h3 id="e171">Middle School Examination in Fujian Province in Late This Month <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Anti-Tide Has Subsided</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence The Fujian Provincial Department of Education will divide the graduating class students of middle schools throughout the province this year into nine examination districts. Each district will form an examination committee, with the county education bureau chiefs, education department supervisors, and principals of middle schools serving as members. The examination is scheduled to begin in late June. However, the graduating class students of middle schools are extremely opposed to this. Students in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xinghua have organized a joint committee, established a resident office in the province, united as one, expanded the movement, and issued a declaration, putting forward four points: ㈠ There is no uniform standard for the curriculum of each school. Although they are all in the general course, the school authorities, in order to suit the personality of the students and the special nature of the school itself, often emphasize a certain subject or adopt a student elective system. The subjects stipulated in the examination method are neither divided into subjects nor are they selected. What we have studied and what the Department of Education examines are obviously different. ㈡ According to the regulations of the examination method, "those who fail in one subject in the examination will not be allowed to graduate," and it is also stipulated that it will not be averaged with the grade scores of the above semesters. It is the intention of education to issue test questions without any standard, and to determine scores without any standard basis. If there is a slight error, three years of effort will be in vain. ㈢ The promulgation of the examination method was not at the time when we entered school, but two months after the beginning of our six semesters of study. We were not given sufficient time to prepare, and we must also test the coursework of the past two years. Our energy is limited, and our time is limited. Within this short period, even if we want to burn the lamp and continue the day, we cannot do it. ㈣ According to the Department's statement, the two courses for the graduation examination are handled in accordance with the orders of the Ministry, and were already announced in the 19th year. Why did the previous two examinations only test the coursework of one semester, while this year there is a difference? However, the attitude of the Department of Education is also very strong, and it has sent telegrams to the examination committees of each district, stating that they are allowed to use coercive measures to suppress students' opposition. Any student who does not participate in the examination alone will have their graduation qualification revoked. If the entire class does not participate in the examination, the entire class will be disbanded. If there is any riotous behavior, the local public security bureau will be notified to send police to arrest and investigate the case. Any student representative who goes to the Department to petition will be rejected. Therefore, the graduating class students of middle schools in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xinghua have all gone on strike, and are carrying out a province-wide strike to resist. The situation is quite serious. The day before yesterday, Liu Aiqi (manager of Fuzhou Electric Company) and other parents of students took the responsibility of mediation. The Department of Education also feared the expansion of the tide, and began to agree to handle the matter in a flexible manner within the scope of not conflicting with the orders of the Ministry. On the one hand, Liu and others persuaded the students to go to class first and wait for the Department's orders to be implemented. The opposition to the examination problem came to an end here.

<p>Completed Within Two Months Starting in the 22nd Year</p>
<p>The Department of Education of Jiangsu Province, in view of the fact that the results of this year's examination of primary school teachers were too poor, fearing that unqualified teachers would greatly mislead children, in addition to planning to set up summer training courses for primary school teachers in districts, in order to clearly understand the current situation of primary school teachers in each county, has specially ordered the implementation of primary school teacher registration, ordering all teachers to complete the registration and report within two months starting in the 22nd year, in order to compile statistics, comprehensively plan, and rectify the measures for teacher training.

<p>Eliminating Misunderstandings Among Some Private School Teachers</p>

<p>The Department of Education of Jiangsu Province, because the reform of private schools is an important policy, is actually seeking opportunities for private school teachers to survive, and for private school children to obtain the right way to study. Therefore, it has requested the provincial government to order all counties to hold a propaganda week for the reform of private schools, and to sincerely inform them of the original meaning of the reform, so that all parties can understand clearly, and the authorities will painstakingly assist in the implementation, in order to achieve practical results. It is reported that the Department of Education, in view of the fact that after the propaganda week was held, most of the private school teachers have been able to wake up and accept the opinions of the administrative authorities, and jointly seek reform methods, while there are still a few stubborn people who have not changed their old ways. Moreover, in the provincial capital, there are some private school teachers who intend to unite and resist. If these people may not be able to fully understand the original meaning of the reform, they will again request the provincial government to order all counties to inform the private school teachers in detail of the significance of the reform of private schools for the benefit of private school teachers and children, and persuade them to voluntarily reform. It is reported that the wording of the original order is extremely sincere. It is also reported that the order clearly stated that if any private school teacher intends to resist, they will be strictly cracked down on.</p>

<p>Ministry Order to Pay Attention to Issuance by the Judicial Yuan</p>
<h3 id="e176">Certificates of Graduation for Law Students <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has issued a circular to the national universities, independent colleges, and private universities with law departments and the relevant education departments, stating that "It has been approved by the Executive Yuan in Instruction No. 2377 that 'It has been approved by the Judicial Yuan that, according to Article 15 of the Regulations on the Supervision of the Law Department of National Universities promulgated by the Judicial Yuan, "The Law Department of National Universities shall follow these regulations, and those who are deemed to have excellent academic performance by the Judicial Yuan shall be issued a certificate by the Judicial Yuan when the students have completed their studies and passed the examination." Furthermore, Articles 16 and 17 state that "These regulations shall also apply to provincial, municipal, and private universities and independent colleges." There have been many cases in recent times where schools have requested the issuance of certificates of graduation for law students, but they have often failed to comply with the requirements of these regulations regarding the submission of course schedules and the request for supervision of examinations. Since the academic performance has not been assessed by this Yuan, certificates cannot be issued hastily. In order to strictly enforce supervision, the Judicial Yuan has formulated five rules for the issuance of certificates of graduation for law students, which will be promulgated separately by Yuan Order. A copy is hereby copied and sent to your Yuan for your information and transmission to the Ministry of Education to notify all universities or independent colleges with law departments to comply with these rules, and to order them to pay attention to Articles 6, 7, 8, and 14 of the regulations, which must be strictly followed and not treated as mere formalities, in order to comply with the law and facilitate assessment.' The original rules are copied and issued to the Ministry of Education for compliance by all universities. This order."</p>
<p>Rules of the Judicial Yuan for the Issuance of Certificates of Graduation for Law Students</p>

According to the Philippine Sports Association, the date had been formally announced previously and was difficult to change once it had been set. This move by the Japanese is clearly creating trouble for no reason, and the future of the Games is unlikely to be optimistic.</p>

<p>A Harmonious and Joyful Football Match</p>

<p>Result: One to One</p>
<p>Shortly after three o'clock yesterday, a dozen or so heroes of Shanghai sports reporters rushed to the Sports Promotion Association. First, they discussed the strategy, and then they took care of the logistics. Pei Shunyuan personally purchased a large number of human-powered flatbed carts loaded with "Ping'an San" (loquat) to quench thirst and "Shengjin Zhike Dan" (tangerines). They changed into military uniforms in the football field changing room and went to the field one after another. How boring, without a matchmaker (referee), how can we get married? Old Teng and Old Wang were so anxious that they ran around in circles. Fortunately, they ran into the veteran Fu Zhibin of Qinghua. Thanks to his righteousness in coming out to serve as the matchmaker under the moon, the good thing could be realized. One team was elegant and refined, and the other team was uncrowned kings. When they met on the battlefield, every move they made caused people to spew out the previous night's dinner and split their guts laughing. A brief record of the scene at the time is for those who have not witnessed it.</p>
<p>The east wind intends to hasten the withering of flowers, and it is becoming increasingly ashamed to say it. Although it was a very ordinary competition, it also alarmed two thousand fans. Many male and female students from Shanghai Middle School arrived, shouting to cheer for their teachers. As the saying goes, the flag is "wearing green clothes and a black man," which is true. Not long after the sports reporters kicked off, it was stolen by Shanghai Middle School's defender, who was indeed an expert at breaking the ball. Tall and strong, he single-handedly saw Sun Daosheng trembling a little. Wu Lisheng passed the ball long, and Yao Liangdong staged an uprising, breaking through to enter the goal. The defender Kang Gan arrived to snatch the ball. Cai Shun took the opportunity to attack, but fortunately, he did not hit any vital points, enraging the cheerleaders in the north stands.</p>
<h3 id="e202">He Who Tied the Bell Must Untie It <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>After this risk taken by the sports reporters, the generals in the rear did not dare to neglect. Xia Kaiming looked ahead and behind, and Pei Shunyuan guarded the southeast corner, both crying and laughing. The enemy saw his headache. The middle-sized Ji Zhizhong embraced the principle of "not killing messengers between warring states." Zheng Xianxian West was active. The northern artillery fire flew horizontally, and the jackals broke into the house. Little Hu tightly closed the gate, his eyes like copper bells. The two generals Zhang and Wang blocked left and right, but unfortunately, four legs could not defeat ten feet. Fortunately, the middle-sized man made up for his crimes by meritorious service. His head hardened, and the ball came out of danger.</p>
<p>With a Heart-to-Heart Connection Xia Kaiming was originally from Shanghai Middle School. Now, he turned his back on his feelings and turned his gun towards his own people. No wonder a little girl scout said that he had forgotten his roots. The sick bug Sun Daosheng was worried about the overall situation. Old Sheng's loyalty was commendable. He took the opportunity to pose a great threat to the opponent. Jiang Huaiqing, who was ambushed in the west corner, often went deep alone and contributed every drop to the public. Qu Yue, with a red face, was extremely active. He drilled east and planned west, and the Shanghai Middle School defender feared him like a tiger. Before long, Xia Kaiming erected a big flag on the center back line. Teng Wengong hurried on his horse. Sun Daosheng ferried the ball with his feet. The real person Qu was waiting for a chance to score, and with a bang, he kicked the ball, causing Zhu Fenghao to cry secretly. The record was opened.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Knocks on the Door Ten Times, But Nine Times It Remains Closed <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Thirty minutes flew by. Fu Zhibin blew his iron flute, and the two armies temporarily stopped fighting, breathing heavily. The warhorses roared again, and the two sides exchanged positions. The sports reporters' line changed greatly. Jiang Huaiqing guarded the old camp. Hu Zongfan was promoted two levels. Ji Zhizhong served as the right wing, with unexpected performances from time to time. Shen Meizhen stole like a rat and kidnapped people from time to time. Old Teng was even more like a wolf and colluded in evil. Sun Daosheng was also good at speculative business. Qu Yue made three beautiful crosses, but Old Teng missed two of them, and Little Shen lost one. Wouldn't that be anxious? But Zheng Xuexian was sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Give a Peach in Return for a Plum Because the war on the front line was fierce, it was urgent to succeed. The defenders of the sports team moved forward one after another. Little Xia supplied military supplies, and Fei Shunyuan transported ammunition. Unexpectedly, Li Shi of Shanghai Middle School made six expeditions to Qishan, with the spirit of "dying at the rear." Zheng Xigu, wearing leather shoes and trousers, would also twist and pinch from time to time, stirring up trouble. Unexpectedly, a spark could start a prairie fire. Look at his foreign tone, how he hooked it, so Tian Ding'an started the engine and rushed to the front, sweeping across his body. Jiang Huaiqing was caught off guard, and it became a tie. After that, the melee lasted for ten minutes before it ended. The two sides shook hands, bowing respectfully to each other, and speaking good words one after another. The spirit was good. In the early battle, the entire sports reporter team was excited. No one was lazy, especially Qu Yue, who bruised one eye and broke a piece of skin. Although the other soldiers were unharmed, who was not pale and sweating profusely?</p>

<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>People must have "qi" (vital energy/spirit). Conversely, without "qi," one certainly cannot be considered human!</p>
<p>However, most people today are ruined by the lack of "qi"! No wonder, because they are not human at all! And those who have a little "popularity" are not allowed to have "qi." They may have a share in farting, but "breathing" is difficult to approve. So everyone holds their breath, and as a result, in the eyes of Westerners, there are no "people" in China, because most Chinese people have no "qi." Don't believe me, look up!</p>
<p>I believe that spiritual distress is the most difficult to endure. Therefore, I thought of a story about an imported product, to share with those who are generally bloated:</p>
<p>It is said that in Wisconsin, USA, there was a certain sports association with a referee. He was so small and weak that, placed among many strong and robust athletes, he felt the same "hair-raising" sensation as the ailing Republic of China, surrounded by powerful foreign powers with covetous eyes. But he was, after all, a person with "popularity." He was impartial in his work and never flinched because the athletes were unruly. One day, he ruled that an athlete had committed a foul and ordered him to stop the game immediately. The athlete refused to accept the ruling and used all sorts of unbearable language to scold the referee. He endured it and, after consideration, resolutely said to the violent athlete, "I want to duel with you. You have insulted me too much." The athlete heard that the referee wanted to duel with him, suddenly stopped his scolding, examined the referee in surprise, and asked him very strangely, "Really want to duel with me? You..." "Yes, I must duel with you. You have insulted me," the other party replied resolutely. So, amidst the athlete's loud laughter, the duel began! The small, weak referee was beaten until his nose was bruised and his eyes were swollen, his face covered in blood. He was knocked down, got up, got up, and was knocked down again. Ah! In the eyes of Chinese people, wouldn't he be an "idiot"! However, he was, after all, a person with "popularity"! He knew that dueling with the other party was in danger of "losing his life," but he felt that his personality had been bullied too much. Although he knew he was going to die, he still resolutely dueled with the other party... dueled... dueled... until he groaned and couldn't hold on, and he didn't have the strength to get up and fight again, the other party also collapsed to the ground! Afterwards, the sports community in Wisconsin publicly sentenced the athlete to imprisonment and awarded the referee a gold medal for bravery!</p>
<p>This story full of "popularity" is really great! I used to talk about it to people in words or writing. At the same time, I think this referee is really worthy of admiration! We Chinese people don't have this kind of silliness!</p>
<p>Some people say that China is ruined by the lack of such fools. I think the person who said this may be a fool himself!</p>
<h3 id="e209">Drizzle <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>At the entrance of a certain theater, red and white electric lights formed the large characters of "Qu Bianzi Massage Parlor." More than a dozen yellow-uniformed policemen, with Mauser pistols and similar weapons at their waists, stood on the left and right sides of the theater entrance. (Note: The authorities used armed force to prevent the performance from starting.) The roads on both ends were crowded with wriggling people. I was using my dull eyes, trying my best to shoot forward, but a burst of sharp singing came from behind, full of ups and downs, "Drizzle, falling endlessly, gentle wind, blowing endlessly, gentle wind and light rain, green willows..."</p>
<p>This delicate singing entered my eardrums, and I turned my head involuntarily to explore the origin of the singing. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be a thin, pale-faced old man with disheveled hair and a curly beard, wearing a torn and dirty long gown, walking back and forth while closing his throat and pretending to be emotional.</p>
<p>"Old man! Although you are also spending your remaining life in this bustling market, you are only embellishing the noise. Society no longer has a place for you. Are you singing like this as if you were living in the days of Wu Huai and Ge Tian? Or are you like Qu Lingjun wandering by the riverside, with unspeakable bitterness in your heart, and using this to vent your complaints?" I almost shouted out.</p>
<p>Life is like a sojourn, one should not create one's own troubles. Su Shi said, "If you pour a basin of water on the ground, mustard will float on the water, and ants will float on the mustard, clueless as to where to go. In a moment, the water dries up, and the ants leave. Seeing their kind, they cry, saying, 'I almost didn't see you again!' How can they know that in the blink of an eye, there are roads in all directions?" With this kind of optimism, no matter how poor you are, you will be happy everywhere. When it comes to national affairs, there are already many officials in charge. The Tanggu Truce Agreement has already been signed. From this, the world is at peace, and there is no need for us poor people to worry. However, general pessimists, knowing that depression is useless, insist on making sick groans. I am also one of them. Why? I don't know myself... "Old man! You are truly a transcendent immortal. I envy you. I am following you, I am chasing you, I want you to lead me to the world of bliss!"</p>

<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>The art of facial expressions is most emphasized by shop clerks. They have two sets of "cold" and "hot" faces, one for male customers and one for female customers. But among female customers, there are also two types of faces. One is for those who are looked down upon, and the other is for the elderly.</p>
<p>Modern women are important figures in society. If there are no modern women to embellish it, society will be dull and lifeless.</p>
<p>The people in society, bustling and bustling, come and go, all relying on wearing masks. If the masks are removed, it will no longer be society.</p>
<p>Although women have the name of "vases," vases must have considerable qualifications, not everyone can be one. If they don't meet these qualifications, they are like earthenware pots and jars. They can only be used for practical purposes in the family, not for people to appreciate.</p>
<p>The signs of "florists" and "lawyers" in Shanghai will gradually increase every year. This shows that the morbidity of society is not light!</p>
<h3 id="e211">Epidemic <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Xin</p>
<p>In natural times, people, in addition to suffering from dry air and mosquito and fly disturbances, will also feel the threat of epidemics.</p>
<p>There are many types of intractable diseases, such as plague, cholera, scarlet fever, diphtheria, meningitis... etc., all of which have the authority to control people's lives.</p>
<p>Last year, Shaanxi Province experienced a tragic epidemic disaster. When cholera began to spread, the local authorities, in order to arouse public attention, specially selected a pair of tigers from the zoo, put them in cages, and paraded them through the city and countryside. This kind of action was very effective in terms of public education, but in fact, due to the poor transportation in the northwest and the difficulty in transporting medicines, the people of Shaanxi died in the hundreds of thousands under such poor epidemic prevention conditions!</p>
<p>I often feel that doing epidemic prevention work in the summer is something everyone should work hard on. As for the methods of epidemic prevention, in addition to paying special attention to diet and daily life, it is also necessary to use germicidal and disinfecting drugs at any time. Asia Pharmacy's "Yalin Odor Water" is manufactured using complete mechanical power and has a long history in society. In addition, there is also a newly invented disinfectant "Yalin Saler," which has been tested by the medical community and is considered very suitable for family epidemic prevention, so I will briefly introduce it here.</p>

<p>Chapter Eight: Angry Words Incite Youth to Resign and Flee; Warm Heart Pities Maiden and Brings Bedding</p>
<p>Seeing that he remained unwilling to speak, Madam Jiang simply had no way to bring up the words she wanted to say. She kept turning over in her mind how to broach the subject. About an hour passed, and Gui Zhi had almost finished mending all four sock bottoms, yet Madam Jiang still hadn't figured out how to articulate what she wanted to say. Just then, they heard two soft coughs in the courtyard, followed by someone asking, "Is nobody home in either the front or back yard?" Gui Zhi put down her needle and thread and immediately opened the door. She saw a girl of around twenty, wearing a maroon coat, a white velvet rope hat, long stockings, and black leather shoes, looking very much like a female student. Gui Zhi said, "Who are you looking for? We are the Yang family here." The female student, seeing that Gui Zhi was also a girl and spoke politely, replied, "Excuse me, isn't there a Zhao family of soldiers living here?" Gui Zhi said, "Yes, the Zhao company commander's grandfather lives here." The female student said, "I went to the back yard just now, but I didn't see anyone." Gui Zhi said, "The master and his servant went to the city." The female student hesitated and said, "What a shame to have come all this way for nothing." Gui Zhi saw that she was carrying a large bundle under her arm and said, "If you have something to say, I can pass it on. If it's not important, you can leave it with us, and we'll give it to them." The female student said, "This bundle is to be entrusted to the Zhao company commander, but to pass it through another's hands..." At this point, she looked hesitant. Madam Jiang came out of the house and said, "May I ask your name, Miss? Are you from the city?" She replied, "My name is Huang Manying. If you mention it, the Zhao company commander will know." As she spoke, she made as if to leave. Madam Jiang said, "It's so cold. How can you stand running back and forth from the city? Why don't you rest at our house for a while and have a bowl of hot water before you leave? The house isn't clean, but it's warm." Huang Manying saw that the woman was so polite and felt it would be too impolite to refuse to come in and sit down, so she nodded and walked into the house with a smile. Gui Zhi also seemed to have a connection with this Miss Huang, and they got along very well in just a few words. (94)</p>

<h3 id="e214">The Secret of Flower Seeds <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>Generally, plant seeds are thought to be hard, solid, and lifeless. However, all seeds contain life, but the duration of seed life varies depending on the storage method. Most seeds last for one or two years, or at most three or four years. Some seeds die within three or four months after harvesting. When seeds are sown and receive the proper temperature and moisture, they will naturally germinate. Therefore, if seeds are stored in a container where they receive the right conditions for germination, the nutrients in the seeds will begin to decompose, just as if they were in the ground. If the storage container is too dry, the seeds will die. In China, the climate during the plum rain season is characterized by increasing humidity and temperature, during which the nutrients in seeds often decompose and germinate. Then, in the hot summer, they easily dry out and die. Therefore, it is important to pay close attention to seed preservation during this period.</p>
<p>Identifying Good and Bad Seeds</p>
<p>In home gardening, we should have the knowledge to distinguish seeds, to know whether a particular seed is viable or dead. This distinction is not easy to make without accurate experience. Here, I will explain the common and easily distinguishable characteristics that one should know. First, look at the color of the seeds. Is it bright and lively? Second, if there is mold on the surface of the seeds, they will not grow well. Third, if the outside is not clear, you can use a small knife to cut open the outer skin and see if the flesh inside has changed color. Generally, it should be white. If it has turned black, it has died due to excessive dryness. Fourth, you can crush the seed with wood or stone. If there is not much moisture or oil, then the seed is also useless.</p>
<p>Seed Dormancy</p>
<p>Various seeds have a dormancy period. For example, some seeds can be sown immediately after harvesting and will grow well. However, some seeds require a certain period before they can germinate. This is the phenomenon of seed dormancy. In general, various plants flower from spring to summer and bear fruit from summer to autumn. Some seeds that fall to the ground can germinate and grow immediately, while others can only germinate in the spring of the following year. If we collect seeds for testing, about 80% to 90% will require a certain period before they can germinate.</p>
<p>Seed Preservation Method</p>
<p>There are many methods for preserving seeds, depending on the type of seed. The most common methods involve using materials that can absorb moisture, such as lime and rice straw ash, sealing them in jars, and placing them in a cool place. For ordinary simple preservation, seeds can be stored in earthenware or porcelain jars, but the mouth of the jar must be sealed with oiled paper to prevent moisture from entering, and then placed in a cool corner of the house. In the past, meticulous people often stored them in boxes made of paulownia wood, because paulownia wood has moisture-proof properties, preventing outside moisture from entering and causing the seeds to decompose.</p>
<p>Seed Germination Rate</p>
<p>When sowing seeds, you must choose the shape of the seeds. Generally, large seeds are fully mature and develop more quickly. Small seeds may be somewhat immature. About 20% to 30% of these seeds cannot germinate. However, the germination rate of seeds varies depending on the type. Morning glories, zinnias, cosmos, and vegetables such as cabbage, radish, and turnip have a germination rate of 80% to 90%. However, the speed of germination often varies depending on the season, humidity, soil, and other factors.</p>
<p>Germination Experiment and Sowing Method</p>
<p>Germination experiments for seeds are inherently very difficult, due to the different properties of the seeds and the differences in climate and humidity. The same seeds often behave differently. Here, I will introduce a common and simple method. First, take 100 seeds (without mustard or soil) and spread them on absorbent paper. Place the paper in a dish, ensuring that the bottom of the dish has adequate moisture. At the same time, cover it with a piece of glass to prevent it from drying out. Place it in a room with a temperature of about 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Some seeds will germinate after four or five days, while others may take two or three weeks or a month. We can then calculate the percentage and determine the germination rate. If sowing in soil, the soil should not be fertile and should not be sown too deep. Only cover it with one or two points of loose soil, just enough to cover the seeds. Cover the top with rice straw. For small seeds, cover the top with newspaper without covering the soil. Spray with water in the morning and evening. Before germination, avoid direct sunlight. However, before sowing, it is best to gently cut the outer skin with a knife and soak it in water for twelve hours. This will make it easier to germinate.</p>

<p>Rampant Abuse of Bills of Exchange Leaves Buyers Helpless</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was precarious. The morning saw a significant drop, and the afternoon continued the trend. Investor sentiment was unsettled and weary. The morning started with gains in Bank of America shares, and both Anglo-American and American-British exchange rates rose by more than a quarter. American cotton rose by seven pounds, American wheat rose by one cent, stocks rose by more than one yuan, and private telegrams rose by half a cent. However, confidence wavered, and spot prices immediately fell. Bingxing sold heavily, exerting considerable pressure. The exchange market also hardened. After opening, domestic prices gradually eased, and the gold market fell sharply. When the price broke through 920 yuan, the Guangdong merchants aggressively unloaded, further weakening the market. The afternoon session closed slightly even. Later, news of a rise of one anna in the Bombay exchange rate and continued easing in the exchange market led to more sellers. The closing price was even lower. Throughout the day, aggressive selling and a sharp easing in the exchange market left buyers helpless. The trend seemed difficult to reverse. However, people's minds were confused and disoriented, making it difficult to act. The spot price was calculated by adding 72 yuan, and the six-seven month swap premium was 11.5 yuan. A record of the day's market conditions follows:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 925.5 yuan, down 8.7 yuan from the previous close. Physicals opened at 5 yuan. The exchange market opened with sterling flat and the US dollar firm at 25. The near-term selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence 125 for sterling and 25.6875 yuan for US dollars. After opening, the exchange market hardened slightly. Nobody wanted US dollars for September at 4.375 yuan. Yuan Maoyong came to sell, pushing the price down from 6 yuan to 4 yuan. China-Belgium Bank bought US dollars for October at 75. Yifeng Yongheng and others bid, pushing the price up. However, with the emergence of US dollars for September at half a yuan from Korea, Zhaofeng, Changfu, Yufu, Chang, Tianfeng, Yongheng, and Xing sold in unison, pushing the price down to within 3 yuan. HSBC announced its rates, with sterling flat and the US dollar up 375. The trend continued to fall, and domestic prices also eased. Fuyu, Qianchang, Xiangqing, Fayong, Yuan Maoyong, Ruiheng, Hengxing, and others repeatedly sold. Andata came out with US dollars for September at 625, and Datong came out with US dollars for July at 1875. Zhengchang also came to sell. When the price broke through the 920 yuan level, investor sentiment became more anxious, and selling intensified. Fuyu, Fuchang, Yuansheng Yongda, Xingyong, and Yuanfeng Yong scrambled to sell. Mitsui even blocked US dollars for September at 8125. Shenkang sold low, and the price fell again to 16 yuan. Qingfa Yongyifeng Yong took advantage of the low price to buy. The exchange market also turned flat and gradually moved upward. Daxing Zhaofeng Chang and Bingxing all bought. Maccari bought US dollars for October at 0625 and rose to over 20 yuan. Andata and others blocked out September at 6875. Later, Yuan Chunli entered the market. Richang and Wanxing also bought, pushing the price up to 21.5 yuan. China-Belgium Bank came out with US dollars for July at 1875. The trend was downward. The afternoon session closed at 920 yuan. Physicals were quoted at the same price.</p>
<p>The afternoon session opened at 920.7 yuan. Physicals opened at 0.3 yuan. Wanxing bid, bringing the price to 1 yuan. However, because Andata came out with US dollars for September at 6875, Qingfa, Fuyu, Yuansheng, Yongchun, Yuanyong, Hongli, Qianchang, and Xiang all sold, pushing the price down. The silver companies blocked September at 75, pushing the price down to 71.1 yuan. Yuan Chunli purchased, and Daxing Yongzheng Chang and Dadecheng bought one after another. Zhongfu and Citibank also absorbed September at 75, still managing to return to 20 yuan. Later, US dollars for September at 75 were hard to come by. Fuyu and Yuan Chun suddenly came out, and the trend weakened again. News from Bombay reported a rise of one anna. Tongyi, Yuansheng, Yonghongli, Hengyu, physicals, Qianchang, and Xiang sold in unison. US dollars for October at 0625 also became hard to come by. Datong blocked the current month at 25, and the price fell to 4.3 yuan, hovering slightly. However, the banks' appetite for buying was poor. Runchang Yudaxing Yong came out again. Xiang Meng sought to block US dollars for September at 9375, pushing the price down to 2.5 yuan. The close before noon was 913 yuan. After the close, physicals rose in price. Richang and Yuan Maoyong also bought. Therefore, physicals were quoted at 14 yuan. The highest price for the day was 926 yuan, and the lowest was 912.5 yuan, a difference of 12.5 yuan. As a result, the closing price fell a disastrous 21.2 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price, due to HSBC's US dollar rate rising by 375 to 25.375 yuan, resulted in a gold price of 945.81 yuan. Based on the closing price, the price was approximately 32 yuan higher, an increase of 7 yuan from the previous close. The current month's entry was 933 yuan, and July was 920 yuan. The morning water was 933 yuan. In the afternoon, the current month's entry was 926 yuan, and July was 913 yuan. The spot price was calculated by adding 72 yuan. The official transaction was at a premium of 78 yuan. The six-seven month swap premium inside the exchange was 11.5 yuan, and Runchang Yong paid Tongyi seven sticks. Only 4,879 sticks remained for the current month.</p>
<p>Supply was plentiful during trading hours. In summary, Hengxing, Bingxing, Yuan Maoyong, Fuyu, Yuanfeng Yong, Fuchang, Qingfa Yong, Yuansheng Yong Qianchang, Xiang, Ruiheng, Hongli, Tongyi, and others all sold. Wanxing, Shunli, Zhaofeng Chang, Yuan Chun, Richang, Yifeng Yong, and others all bought. Daxing Yongheng and Zhengchang bought and sold at times. Among the Dalian merchants, Wanxing sold 147 sticks in the morning, and Shunli sold 77 sticks. In the afternoon, Wanxing bought 297 sticks, and Shunli bought 189 sticks. In summary, all bought. Among the Guangdong merchants, Hengxing sold a total of over 900, including over 700 sold on behalf of Shenkang. A total of 22,540 July chips were outstanding.</p>
<p>Sharp Rise in Silver Prices and Exchange Rates</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to reports from London, the near-term contract decreased by 0625, while the far-term contract remained unchanged. The New York silver price rose by half a cent. The sterling-dollar exchange rate rose sharply by 4.625, and the dollar-sterling exchange rate also rose by 4.875. The far-term silver price rose by 4.5 to 5%. American cotton, American wheat, and stocks all rose. Private telegrams also rose by half a cent. Investor sentiment deteriorated. The exchange market opened with sterling flat and the US dollar firm at 25. The near-term selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence 125 for sterling and 25.6875 yuan for US dollars. After opening, the market immediately hardened. Later, the banks bought and sold at times. HSBC announced its rates, with sterling flat and the US dollar up 375. Later, the market hardened further, approximately 3125 stronger than at the start. The afternoon session closed slightly flat. The market continued to harden in the afternoon. News from Bombay reported a rise of one anna. The closing price was 0625 and 3125 stronger than the afternoon close. At the close, Xiang Meng was still willing to sell, but there were no buyers. The closing selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence 25 for sterling and 26.25 yuan for US dollars, an increase of 125 (sterling) and 8125 (US dollars) from the previous close. Banks were more inclined to sell than to buy. Gold traders both bought and sold. Generally, the Dalian merchants were sellers, and the Guangdong merchants were slightly bullish.

The call loan market saw ample supply and limited demand, resulting in a slight decrease of one cent from the previous day, calculated at seven cents.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw an increasingly peaceful market. Both bulls and bears adopted a wait-and-see approach, and investor sentiment was lax. This is an inevitable stage after a period of volatility. Overall, the trend was weak but firm, with no exciting developments. In the morning, the listed securities initially fell by three to five jiao. Later, starting with the 20 series, various merchants showed a stronger appetite for buying, and there was no shortage of scattered buyers, gradually boosting prices by one or two jiao to around six jiao. Consequently, the situation changed slightly in the second session. The 1920 readjustment loan surged by as much as eight or nine jiao, showing signs of recovery, but this was primarily due to swap and arbitrage activity, resulting in occasional abnormal conditions. Later, the 20-year treasury bonds rose, but supply still exceeded demand, causing them to fall slightly by three or four jiao. In the afternoon, except for the 1920 customs loan, which saw a slight rebound of over three jiao, the remaining securities continued to fall by three or four jiao. However, the salt tax bonds were relatively strong, slightly boosting investor sentiment. The closing prices increased across the board by two or three jiao to around five jiao, indicating a potential recovery. If the salt tax bonds can break through the 50 yuan level again, there could be a further increase of one or two yuan. Overall, the day's market prices resulted in increases ranging from two or three jiao to six or seven jiao, with only the 1918 customs consolidation and disarmament bonds falling by about five fen or two jiao. The Jiangzhe silk industry public bonds issued in 1921, with a total value of 3 million, began trading in the spot market yesterday. Due to the limited amount, there were no futures transactions. The market price was 72.6 yuan. The total transaction volume was 4,449,100 yuan, including 16,000 yuan in spot transactions and 5.205 million for futures, consolidated salt tax, 1.96 million for disarmament, 2.85 million for 19 customs loan readjustment, 3.14 million for 20 customs, and the remainder ranged from tens of thousands to 835,000, 485,000.</p>

<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market was stable on Wednesday (7th), with favorable news from all sides and exceptionally strong buying interest. According to Steel Century, steel capacity utilization has now reached 44%, and some predict that June orders will exceed May orders. The large number of attendees at the automotive industry conference was rare since July 1931. Retailers are experiencing supply shortages, and it is predicted that June steel production will not decrease due to seasonal factors. Major rubber companies have increased tire prices by 9%, and inner tube prices by 15%. The Rock Island Railroad filed a petition with the Chicago Federal Court to reorganize its capital structure in accordance with the new railroad reorganization law. Railroad stocks showed mixed and uneven performance. Total daily trading volume was 6.64 million shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>The gauze market is somewhat stable, but the situation is deceptively weak. Because actual demand is too sluggish, the gauze inventory in warehouses is increasing daily, causing discouragement. New short sellers are gradually becoming active. However, major buyers are still considering the difficulties of the factories, and there is no sign of increased absorption. The future situation is not optimistic.</p>
<p>(Fluctuations in Manchu Standard Visible) The opening of the Manchu Standard market this morning showed good momentum. Due to a slight rise in American cotton, some profit-takers covered their positions. By the third session, the market was extremely weak, resulting in a rise of nearly two jiao for near-term contracts and seven to eight jiao for distant contracts. After the afternoon opening, there was a sharp drop of over one yuan. The second and third sessions rebounded by one yuan, but the market fell again at closing. As a result, contracts for all months fell by 1.2 jiao to eight jiao. Total daily trading volume was 59,200 bales. Sales were led by Renfeng with 3,950 bales, Taichang with 2,600 bales, and Hengde with 1,250 bales.

<p>Same Trade 150, Anqing 10, Ningbo 5</p>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. There was a slight upward trend in the Shanghai cotton market. Buyers' sentiment strengthened again. It was reported in the afternoon that the raw cotton business was still quite prosperous, and the market surged. There were rumors in the market that there was a shortage of old cotton this month, leading to short squeezes. As a result, more speculators were buying to cover their short positions. However, short sellers' attitudes were very high, and the future situation lacked certainty.</p>
<p>(Many Short Sellers in Zheng Standard) The opening of the Zheng Standard market this morning was relatively tight, with many buyers in the market. The market fell again at closing. The current month rose by two jiao, and distant months fell by 1.5 jiao. Total daily trading volume was 162,600 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially fell due to good weather, but later rose due to firms buying back and improved market sentiment. Spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures prices rose by 5 to 8 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 11 points, and futures prices fell by 7 to 8 points. Although there were a few speculators buying in the Bombay cotton market, this was offset by long liquidation and sales by Japanese traders. The market was quiet and stable. As a result, Pinggu'er fell by 1.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 3 rupees, and Bairuoxi fell by 2.75 rupees. Original telegraph record, (7th dispatch).</p>

<p>(Jiahu Cocoon Market Gradually Comes to an End) The cocoon season in Jiaxing and Huzhou is about ten days later than in Hangzhou and Shaoxing. This year's cocoon production is generally only 40-50%. The best cocoons are from Nanxun in Huzhou. The cocoon market is gradually ending. The highest cocoon price for improved varieties is 50 yuan, and the lowest for local varieties is 24-25 yuan.</p>
<p>(Many Haining Residents Spun Their Own Native Silk) Late silkworm development is quite good. Silkworm farmers' costs are not low, but cocoon prices are not high, 20-30 yuan lower than last year. Therefore, they are all taking them home to bake using local methods and are mostly spinning their own native silk. Cocoon shops are collecting only a little over a thousand dan, and some are collecting less than a hundred dan.</p>
<p>(Most of the Shaoyang Cocoon Shops Have Stopped Weighing) Cocoon shops in the surrounding villages have been open for business for ten days. This year's cocoon production is still abundant, and the amount collected by each shop is not small. Most have already stopped weighing. The average cocoon price is 40 yuan. (Jiangning Foreign Variety Cocoons Are of the Highest Quality) Improved varieties account for 80-90%. Cocoon production is better. The baking loss is only 280 jin. The highest price for high-quality cocoons is 45 yuan, and for local varieties, it is 28-29 yuan.</p>
<p>(Sichuan Raw Silk from Factories Continues to Flow Smoothly) The Shanghai warehouse inventory was originally thick, and then through the</p>
<p>European firms' continuous operations, raw silk is</p>
<p>Almost sold out. Iron machine, wood machine rebound and small car factories etc. also have small inventory. Production area inventory is not low. Each silk factory will soon start reeling new cocoons. Old goods are transported from Li to Shanghai. Recently, a total of 273 pieces of Sichuan raw silk have arrived.</p>
<p>(Sales of Rayon Show Strong Momentum) Yesterday, the Hangzhou-Shaoxing guilds traded 34 boxes of Shuangxing, Sanxing, and Deji brand number one and two grade rayon for June delivery at prices ranging from 175.75 yuan to 161.50 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Yellow and White Raw Silk Firms Firmly Maintain Prices) Overseas silk prices are soaring. Spot and futures trading in New York is quite active. Most of the futures silk previously held by general speculators has been sold. European firms in Shanghai have a strong desire to hoard. As European and American telegrams indicate that silk prices are not high, Chinese silk merchants have high capital costs, and the cocoon market in the Suzhou region has not yet ended, so they are all holding firm and not selling. Trades included 100 bales of Shanghai white raw silk, 120 bales of Shandong yellow raw silk, 200 bales of white spun silk, and 20 bales of Sichuan raw silk, all at prices that continued to rise by 20 yuan.</p>

<p>Qimen Huaxiang black tea was opened for sale yesterday by the British firm, Tianyu Foreign Firm. Over a thousand boxes were negotiated, with a selling price of 16 yuan, 2-3 yuan lower than last year's opening price. As for the black tea market, it is becoming increasingly sluggish. There are no transactions for high-grade and medium-grade Zhuang goods above 100 yuan. Only the last batches of goods were slightly purchased by Yihuo Foreign Firm, with a selling price of 60 yuan, another 4-5 yuan lower than before. Green tea has also slightly changed in recent days. Luzhuang's core-extracted Zhenmei and Pingshui local Zhuang's pearl tea needle eyebrows are selling. Ordinary batches of Zhenmei are selling for another 7-8 yuan less. The situation is still unfavorable, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Grain Thin Rice Drops Another Two Jiao <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Over forty sources. Suzhou Tong's japonica rice and Nangang thick rice are still selling at the same price on this street, and the market is stable. Qingjiao, Songjiang, Xilian, and other thin rice varieties and high-quality materials are not being purchased much because customers from Tianjin have reduced prices. Medium-grade goods and secondary goods are all being purchased by the Nanyang Xinghua gang, but they are demanding harsh terms, and the market price has been reduced by two jiao. Due to the limited sales of Duyang Jian, the price has also decreased slightly, and the price of Biantinyuan does not fluctuate.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were three or four ships from various routes. Sales of white japonica rice are still sluggish, and the market is weak again. Although the arrival of thin rice is not strong, sales are average, and the price has decreased by 7-8 fen. The arrival of early rice continues, but retail sales are still sluggish, and the price has increased by 1-2 jiao. Yangjian is priced high, and medium and secondary grades are weak by several fen. The price of Dufu Kejian is also showing a downward trend, and the price of Yinyuan is declining.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Fuzhou gang paid attention to red rough rice and completed 2,500 packages of Hunan rough red rice. There is not much red rough rice in stock, and there is a possibility of a rebound this month. However, a new batch arrived yesterday, and hoarders also returned some stock, so the market price stabilized. Yesterday, the opening market price for high-quality goods was 7.75 yuan, ranging from 7.13 yuan to 7.1 yuan. Sales of other rice varieties from Min are sluggish. Although there are inquiries from Wentai, the quantity sold is not large, and the price is slightly lower by 3-5 fen. 64 packages of Hunan coarse Jing rice were purchased for 6.1 yuan, and 220 packages of Nanjing Chexian rice were purchased for 7.3 yuan. 200 packages of Xiaojiao were returned from this street for 7.8 yuan. There were few other incoming or outgoing shipments.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Flour Market Trends Gradually Weakening <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a trend of declining directly. When the market opened in the morning, prices for both near and distant months had already shown a slight decline. Then, large and small factories all began to dump their holdings. Longs tried to hold the line, and shorts added to their positions. Customer sales were also watching the market. Moreover, with the next abundant harvest of new wheat and rumors that the first batch of borrowed American wheat would arrive in port before the end of the month, the market price eventually saw a step-by-step decline in the afternoon, although there were attempts to cover short positions and take advantage of the small rebound. The afternoon sessions were especially weak, with the forward months lower by a small three fen and the near months lower by a small two fen or so. Later, the selling pressure from the factories eased slightly, and the market gradually stabilized at the close. However, market sentiment did not improve. The closing price for the current month and next month each fell by 1.5 fen, August fell by 1 fen, September fell by 1.25 fen, and October fell by 1.75 fen. November fell by 2.25 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Wheat Futures Fall More Sharply <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Each side throws off set strongly</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market for new wheat. Because merchants were aware of the poor situation in Shanghai, production prices did not decrease, and they did not dare to ask. Only the factory itself took over some stock and sent it directly to the factory. After the standard wheat market opened, due to the influence of the abundant harvest of new wheat and the arrival of borrowed wheat, all parties were pessimistic and strongly sold off, and the trend of decline became sharper. The near term fell first, and the distant months followed. The distant months were more heavily sold because they were related to the arrival of foreign wheat in China and the influx of new wheat. The closing price for October was 9 fen lower than the previous day's closing price, July was 5 fen lower, August was noted as 10ths fen lower, September was 7 fen lower, and November was 8 fen lower.</p>

<p>The first batch of new barley from Hankou arrived yesterday, totaling over seventy packages. The goods were of good quality, and the price opened at 2.2 yuan. It was purchased by this street. In recent years, the sales of this type of barley have not been as active as in previous years. This is because the demand for horse feed in Shanghai is very low, relying only on the demand from wineries and pond workshops. How much can be sold? Therefore, the future market situation may not be optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Sugar Market, Coarse Sand, White Sugar Follow Gold Prices Down Again <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened further as benchmark gold fell by over ten yuan and the Dutch exchange rate did not change. The guild marked down the price of 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods by six fen, with 200 packages traded at 20.22 yuan. Although the prices for No. 20 medium sand white and No. 8/9 Dutch red sugar were quoted at the original price, there were no transactions. Changxing Firm opened Guanghua Factory's Lu character at 20.055 yuan, Shou character at 19.9 yuan, ground sand plus Guang package at 20.075 yuan, and RA cotton Dutch white at 21.3 yuan. Some Chao merchants opened new Hangzhou Zhuang cotton red 80 to 90 packages, with prices ranging from 16.1 yuan to 16 yuan, Huanggang green over fifty packages, with prices ranging from 12.2 yuan, and sliced green several tens baskets, with prices ranging from 9.5 yuan. Guang merchants opened over one hundred pieces of Gaozhuang Huizhou foreign white, with prices ranging from 18.4 yuan to 18 yuan, and also Hainan red over one hundred and ten packages, with prices ranging from 13.68 yuan.</p>

<p>Since the new Sichuan pickled mustard vegetables have been released, the lowest customer price for ordinary goods has been 19 yuan. Now, as the old goods have been sold out and the supply is scarce, customer sentiment has firmed, and merchants with stock on hand must quote 20 yuan before they are willing to sell.</p>
<p>Metal Newly Arrived Lead Wire Sells Well</p>
<p>New lead wire has been trading extremely well recently. Gangs from the Yangtze River inland, Fujian, Yantai, Qingdao, and other places have all purchased it. Even factories on this street are consuming a lot, and the arrival of goods is booming, so there is no shortage of goods in the market. Because market sentiment is stable, there have been no changes in prices.</p>
<p>Also, green lead trading is especially active. Over 5,000 dan were opened yesterday. It is said that purchasers include Huangdan Factory, paint companies, and Yangtze River customers. The market price is slightly looser than before, with each dan priced at 16.9 yuan. However, the market price is still shouting for 17.5 yuan.</p>

<p>— Huan Yi</p>
<p>In this civilized era of the Republic of China, talking about fate is simply out of touch with the times, or at least it is a backward person with a dull mind.</p>
<p>But, in my opinion: Destiny is indeed a truly believable thing. Of course, things must be based on evidence.</p>
<p>A person's so-called wealth, nobility, longevity, and short life are all destined in their fate long ago. Moreover, not only is this true for humans, but also for small ants, static objects like a cup or a table, and large entities like a country. All have their own destiny. If their fate is good and their luck is smooth, no matter how they stumble, they will never encounter bad luck. But, what if the opposite is true? Then it's terrible, no matter what you do, medicine and stone are useless, and you can only suffer until you die. This is a great theory for those who are proficient in the way of fate.</p>
<p>China's "national destiny" can probably not be said to be good! As for "national luck"? That's also terrible. Just open up the history books and take a look. It's really lively, like a red-faced man fighting a white-faced man on a stage, and a white-faced man chasing a black-faced man. It's been like this for thousands of years, and we've simply never had good luck. In 633 years, we had the misfortune of being ruled by foreign races twice. Fortunately, Heaven never abandons a nation. After the bad luck was shed, we ushered in the good luck of the Great Republic of China. But, after all, because the "national destiny" is too bitter, the grand luck has also turned into a weak luck. For 22 years, we have almost lost half of our national life. This is probably called bad luck!</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about our "people's destiny." Of course, the fate of the parents is indescribably bitter, so the fate of the children can only be slightly better. Let's not talk about the past, let's just talk about recent encounters. The poor, suffering people who deserve to suffer, when they bid farewell to Yama and came to the Yang world in large numbers, probably had a Yama ticket attached to them, as if they had signed a contract to "live" and "die" and be "slaves of a fallen country" together. Just look at the drought in Shaanxi and Gansu a few years ago, where millions died of starvation in one batch, and the great flood in central China the year before last, where millions were submerged again. Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces have been lost due to the lack of "national luck." The number of people who have been invited to become slaves of a fallen province is over 30 million. Poor little people who deserve to suffer disasters, who are you going to blame for your own bitter fate?</p>
<p>Therefore, whether they are refugees, disaster victims, or slaves of a fallen province, they are all victims of their own misfortune, and it has nothing to do with anyone else. In other words: because their own fate is bitter, they have attracted many disasters, and this has affected the lack of "national luck." It is useless for others to help them. Therefore, expelling refugees and prohibiting refugees from landing are really urgent tasks that various places cannot delay at present. Because thieves already have a poor, sour air, and refugees and disaster victims are all wearing a crying face. They are all full of the air of disaster. If they are infected by them, then it will really be a big problem. Moreover, in a metropolis that is promoting high-class entertainment and lifting the ban on prostitution, wouldn't it be a great disappointment?</p>
<p>It's not worth talking about bitter fate. Let's change the topic and talk about good fate. Here, I am very happy to borrow the weight of our young marshal again. Like begets like, the son of a great marshal is of course a young teacher. Precisely because he is a young marshal, after all, his fate is worlds apart from the fate of refugees, disaster victims, and slaves of a fallen province, and they cannot be compared at all. Although the three northeastern provinces are lost, he is still extraordinary. Not only does he not become a slave of a fallen province, but he can also live freely outside the situation. Although the little people are in an uproar for a while, the letters and telegrams are like snowflakes, and the impeachment documents of the Supervisory Yuan are really like the saying goes, "throwing Beijing bricks as New Year's greetings." But, because his fate is prosperous and he is blessed by lucky stars, even a hair has not been shaken. This is a concrete proof.</p>
<p>Alas! Poor little people, who are you going to blame?</p>

<p>— Wei</p>
<p>I often have to pass through a short street. In addition to some small shops as usual, there is a dim church, with a gray steeple towering above. On one side of the church, a uniform building houses a primary school. Children gather like ants in the hallways, running, bouncing small balls, fighting, and quarreling.</p>
<p>In the morning, the streetcar carries me from a far distance to the vicinity of the church. I and two other children get off. When I ask them why they came so far, I get a candid answer: it's just because of their faith.</p>
<p>Hypocrites, under the protection of God, simple, loyal, kind, and tolerant subjects, children are suffering because of strict religious education.</p>
<p>I sometimes encounter some elderly and virtuous agents of God's authority - priests. It is really a great pleasure. One evening, I met one again. Because an old beggar woman was squatting by the side of the street begging, the priest was furious and called the police to take her away in a depressed manner. The priest must have been worrying, thinking that God had already condemned her to enough suffering, how dare she commit a crime near the church! The people of your country pretend not to see and talk and laugh as if nothing had happened, or perhaps there are one or two stifled resentments or sighs, very lightly, without hearing a sound.</p>
<p>In this way, the street cannot find a person who does not rely on capital or ability to eat. The priest is diligently working for the face and peace of the street.</p>
<p>Then, one day, I don't know what festival it is, the bright and solemn bells are striking, and extravagant light is emitted in front of the glorious altar. I enter the church for the first time. Everyone is devoutly praying and performing Mass. A ridiculous and serious atmosphere envelops the space. The priest at the main altar uses various gestures to bless people and beg for God's forgiveness. The crowd is hypnotized and numb.</p>
<p>"Lord! Listen! The rich are innocent, the evidence is that the Lord has given them money, so punish the guilty with poverty until death. The poor are guilty people, and may the Lord not bless them, let them live a few more years, and then transcend. Amen!"</p>

<p>Skilled in battle, courageous and bold, they did not hesitate to go through fire and water. It was only because the reinforcements were cut off and the bullets were exhausted that, although defeated, they were still glorious and righteous.</p>
<p>Looking east, the disaster victims are pitiful, and they are suffering from an unprecedented catastrophe. Raising soldiers to defend against foreign enemies and drive out the strong enemies is a responsibility that should be shouldered to recover our territory,</p>

<p>— Xue</p>
<p>Auntie Li suddenly received a happy greeting, which turned out to be from her nephew, Fei, whom she used to hold in her arms, who was about to get married, and the wedding date was so close. "Hey! Take a look, this invitation." Auntie Li said, pointing to the newly delivered wedding invitation, looking at her husband.</p>
<p>"Oh? Is Fei really getting married?" At this time, he had some disbelief in his expression, as if he was wondering how a child who was not yet of age and whose finances were not yet independent could get married right away. In that moment of his suspicion, she said like this:</p>
<p>"Don't you believe it? They have money. In this realistic society, with money, even getting a beautiful woman is easy, let alone marrying a daughter-in-law?"</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Indeed, I can't deny what you said, of course."</p>
<p>"In that case, we, who are called uncle and aunt, should give a good gift."</p>
<p>"What should we give? But our economy is so tight. If we give a lot, how will we be able to do it?"</p>
<p>"It's difficult enough! In Shanghai, the usual etiquette of giving gifts requires at least a pair of glasses (two yuan), let alone the situation is different now. We are close relatives, and we are also 'elders', so we must at least give a hand (five yuan) to make it presentable."</p>
<p>"Alas, under this current social system, this kind of etiquette of giving gifts, which is close to extortion, is always unbreakable. If we reach another new society, for things like marriage, the parties only need to register with the XX organization, and there is no such thing as giving or not giving gifts at all."</p>
<p>"How can you say that? It sounds like you're trying to escape giving a gift, so you're singing such a high-pitched tune, haha!"</p>
<p>"Although you're still smiling at me slightly now, the inner disappointment is still very clearly visible."</p>
<p>"No. The problem is not just giving the gift, there's also a related matter of giving the gift that needs to be discussed urgently. Guess what!"</p>
<p>"What? I don't know."</p>
<p>"It's the problem of clothes. The weather is getting warmer day by day. The 'Indian silk' cheongsam I made last year is old and small again. How can I wear it to receive the meeting gift from my nephew's new wife?"</p>
<p>"······" He remained silent, as if it was none of his business.</p>
<p>"If you're not going to speak up, we have to think of a solution. Our reputation is at stake."</p>
<p>"Isn't Sister Cheng Er has a new dress that she just put on? Her figure is about the same as yours. You might as well borrow it. After all, you know each other very well."</p>
<p>"Oh! That's so cheap? Miss Cheng Er's clothes have always been more precious than a dragon robe and phoenix coronet. Please come up with another brilliant plan!"</p>
<p>"Then we'll have to quickly publish a notice to sever our relationship as nephew and uncle, otherwise, it would really be 'dying for face and living in suffering'...'"</p>
<h3 id="e238">Female Fortune Teller <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Yi</p>
<p>Yesterday, around four or five in the afternoon, I had just finished classes at school and returned home. As I was about to step through the main gate, I suddenly heard a commotion from next door, with sounds of "still barren," "afraid of being childless," "a clash in the palace of fate," and other superstitious ramblings. I thought, "I wonder what new oddity has emerged to provide material for my poor struggling writer to submit."</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, and also to understand the matter thoroughly, I immediately ran to the home of Mother Ma next door.</p>
<p>Oh, if I hadn't looked, I might have been fine, but one look left me dumbfounded. The room was packed with people—men, women, old, young, old ladies, young mistresses—but mostly old ladies and young mistresses. In the center of the room sat a Yangzhou woman, about forty or fifty years old, holding a box in her hands. Inside the box were paper scrolls, various almanacs, and a thousand mud paper copies, and a leather "spiritual officer" in a three-in-one form. Sitting opposite her was a young mistress of about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. I only heard the female fortune teller from Yangzhou say to the young mistress, "Young mistress, don't worry or fret. According to your age and birth month, your palace of fate is clashing with the 'child-harming star.' That's why you haven't conceived in the seven or eight years since you've been married. If you want to have sons and daughters, you must resolve this 'earth-defeating star,' then there is hope. Otherwise, you may never conceive..." The young mistress immediately asked, "Then how can the 'harming star' be resolved?" The female fortune teller replied, "There's no other way. You must consult the spiritual officer, only then will we know."</p>
<p>So, the fortune teller took the three-in-one spiritual officer out of the box. I just saw her mutter for a while into its ear, then she turned to the young mistress and said, ""</p>
<p>Just now the spiritual officer said that your harming star can be resolved, but it's too severe and will cost at least eight yuan in tinfoil fees, plus my handling fee of two yuan, totaling ten yuan. It cannot be done without it." "That's a bit too expensive. I can't scrape together ten yuan right now. Can you lower the price..." said the young mistress. The female fortune teller said, "This is what the spiritual officer requires. How can the price be lowered? My handling fee of two yuan is already the bare minimum. It can't be reduced any further. If you're not sincere, the spiritual officer will get angry, and that's not a joke."</p>
<p>The female fortune teller said solemnly, "Alright, then, let's do it this way," said the young mistress. So, the female fortune teller took the spiritual officer and circled it around the young mistress's body, up and down, front and back, thousands of times, then said, "Your harming star has been resolved. Here are eight pills, you two should each take four of them on [day and month omitted], that night, you're guaranteed to conceive a son. If you give birth to a boy, I'll come to collect the celebration money and have a cup of celebratory wine. Haha?" The female fortune teller, displaying her supernatural powers, said very triumphantly.</p>
<p>The young mistress then took ten silver dollars and handed them to the female fortune teller. The female fortune teller, beaming, thanked her and left.</p>
<p>I watched closely from the side and couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>Two hours, ten silver dollars. Even a university professor doesn't make that much. What about small teachers like us?</p>
<h3 id="e239">Female Worker, Jiao Di <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>Breaking the silence of the air, a loud whistle sounded; the gates of the XX First Factory spewed out a group of male and female workers completely exhausted and sinking into excessive fatigue. Jiao Di was one of the female workers, an unfortunate girl who had fled from a declining rural village. Introduced by a fellow villager, Li Xiaobao, she had been wearing away her remaining youth in the clatter of machinery for three months!</p>
<p>At this moment, she was carrying a green enamel lunch box, exiting the factory gate; walking alone on the cement sidewalk along the side of the road, heading towards the nearby slum.</p>
<p>After a stretch of road, she turned into an alley. The neighbors living here were all from the working masses laboring in the factory. Jiao Di entered through the back door of the third house. It was early summer, and although the sun had already sunk below the horizon, the sky was not yet covered by a grey twilight. The streetlights on the road shone lonely on the oiled asphalt.</p>
<p>Jiao Di's mother, a middle-aged woman, similarly a bitter soul pushed out of the countryside, had already prepared dinner for her laboring daughter.</p>
<p>It was the middle of the night, just when the excitement of the dance hall was waning and the city was opening for the night. But in a dead and silent slum, everything was as quiet as death. Jiao Di lay on the wooden bed, her two dark eyes constantly gazing at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin, the supervisor at the factory, who was always known for being strict and impartial, why was he so humble towards her today? His usual sternness was gone, and he even promised her the beautiful dream she had longed for. Suddenly, Jiao Di remembered a story told by her little sisters.</p>
<p>Half a year ago, there was a Wuxi female worker named Zhang Guifang who was favored by Supervisor Lin. One stormy night, in the Dongfang Hotel, he achieved his ultimate goal. The next day, her husband found out and angrily went to the factory to cause trouble but was stopped. When the wife, humiliated and resentful, went to work, she was dismissed. Zhang Guifang committed suicide in anger, and her husband was plotting revenge.</p>
<p>Jiao Di thought of this and felt a darkness descend, as if her future was buried in darkness. The sky, illuminated by the city's neon lights, condensed into red clouds, while Jiao Di in the slum stared blankly at the solitary lamp.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Three Legal Questions <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Because you are our kind guiding light, I have several questions to ask you. Please don't refuse and give me clear instructions!</p>
<p>(1) Our ancestral temple is jointly owned by factions A, B, and C. Faction A is further divided into sub-factions Zi, Chou, and Yin. The temple was burned down by bandits due to troop deployment the year before last. Now, each faction wants to rebuild, but some in the minority faction under A oppose the reconstruction. The matter has become an official case. I don't know if the minority faction can legally oppose it.</p>
<p>(2) Our clan is divided into five branches: Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parent, and Teacher. The Heaven, Earth, and Ruler branches share the same family genealogy, while the Parent and Teacher branches have their own. Unexpectedly, the Ruler branch has died out and has no relatives, so no one is inheriting it. Now, there is someone older than the deceased who is going to inherit (that is, the stepfather is over fifty years old, while the stepson is over sixty years old, the seniority is appropriate). What do you think the legal outcome of this matter would be if it became a lawsuit?</p>
<p>(3) A friend of mine is a street vendor in Shanghai. Last year, through an introduction, he became involved with a widow, intending to marry her and continue his lineage. Until this year, he learned that the woman had taken cold medicine and could not have children. Since this is contrary to the purpose of continuing the lineage, he wants to separate. However, the woman refuses and is holding the matchmaker responsible. Although the man and woman have had a relationship, it is only cohabitation and there is no formal marriage or contract. Separation is unavoidable. Is there any legal responsibility? I am afraid that if it cannot be resolved, it will have to be taken to court!</p>
<p>I would be grateful if you could give your kind guidance on the above three questions. With best wishes,</p>
<p>Sincerely, Qiming</p>

<p>Editor's Note: The nature of ancestral temples can promote the power of national solidarity. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen also gave considerable encouragement in his Three Principles of the People. However, although this kind of thing is good, it can only be regarded as an adornment for the propertied class and cannot be considered an indispensable organization. So, it is a good thing that your family temple was destroyed and you want to rebuild it. However, all expenses should be collected by those who agree. Legally, the minority who oppose it cannot be forced to pay.</p>
<p>According to current laws, a person's estate, unless the deceased made a will during their lifetime designating an heir, should be determined in the following order: (1) direct descendants, (2) direct ascendants, (3) spouse, (4) siblings; relatives beyond the fifth degree are not included. According to the letter, the Ruler branch has become estranged from the other branches. If the deceased did not have a will, the estate should be considered "unclaimed property" and the authorities should be asked to dispose of it according to law. Distant relatives may not interfere. When Mr. X met the woman, he probably expressed his desire to marry her. Therefore, it is best to resolve this matter through negotiation. Otherwise, she can accuse Mr. X of "using fraudulent means to make a person submit to fornication."</p>

<h3 id="e243">The Life of the Five Sisters (28th installment) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Although Wu Gui was a worldly-wise person, he was truly puzzled to see the Fifth Mistress and the Second Mistress being so intimate, completely like biological sisters. How many concubines are there who can't help but be jealous, even to the point of domestic unrest and chaos, but these two mistresses were able to show sincerity and respect; the last time the Fifth Mistress bothered the Second Mistress for a visit, today the Fifth Mistress returned the favor.</p>
<p>This banquet was truly lavish. Even Zhang Wenbin, who was secretly invited by Su Lao, was included. There were only three people, but so much food was served that they only ate a bite or two of each dish before instructing the maids to take it away. However, tonight they consumed two full bottles of wine. Since it was sweet, the Second Mistress couldn't resist the Fifth Mistress's encouragement and drank a few more cups. But she always thought that this wine must be mixed with whiskey, otherwise how could it be so easy to get drunk? Indeed, the Second Mistress felt a little tipsy.</p>
<p>The Fifth Mistress also knew a little about Zhang Shao's character from the servants' gossip, but now, after his own very reasonable explanation, she couldn't help but suspect that Minister Su was getting more confused as he got older. Could it be that two young men and women together must have immoral behavior? This was an overstatement.</p>
<p>Moreover, Zhang Wenbin's character was very pleasing to the Second Mistress. How could such an intelligent and handsome young man be willing to do such scandalous things? Because she trusted him too much, she couldn't help but look at him a few more times. She saw his delicate eyes shining with watery, intoxicating light, his cheeks flushed, and she couldn't help but admire him secretly.</p>
<p>"Truly, a beauty of China!"</p>
<p>However, in Zhang Wenbin's eyes, the Second Mistress also had a unique charm. Although she was a bit older, she had a foreign flair. Thinking of this, Zhang Shao felt a tingling sensation that he couldn't explain. If this woman were Miss Liu, then he would be too happy.</p>
<p>Afterward, everyone felt that they couldn't eat anymore, so the Fifth Mistress personally left her seat and started a Western dance record, allowing Zhang Shao to dance with the Second Mistress, while she lay on the sofa smoking. Soon, she simply left the room, closed the door, and went to the bathroom. Then, Zhang Shao naturally became bolder, dancing, dancing, hugging tightly while dancing. The beating of his heart was so rapid that he could barely breathe.</p>
<p>It was almost ten o'clock, and the Fifth Mistress urged Zhang Shao to send the Second Mistress back. However, the Fifth Mistress still felt strangely uncomfortable, watching the Second Mistress happily take Zhang Wenbin's arm and walk out the door. Fortunately, Minister Su soon returned from visiting the home of a government official. He would inevitably pester her for another night. Otherwise, how would she survive this annoying long night?</p>

<p>Foreign Stars Have Regained Their Sense That America Is Livable</p>
<p>The Department of Labor Has Stopped Thoroughly Investigating the Nationality of Film Stars</p>
<p>What is the current status of the thorough investigation of the nationality of film stars that was rumored in Hollywood, America, not long ago? This question was rife with rumors a few months ago, and it caused panic among many foreign stars, technicians, and artists. Several people, fearing a loss of face, took the opportunity to leave the United States and return to their country in advance, and many were reluctant to leave and quietly waited for the punishment of "deportation." Now, it seems that no one is mentioning this issue anymore.</p>
<p>The thorough investigation of the nationality of Hollywood film stars initially occurred in the U.S. Department of Labor, which was also one of the last public cases of the Hoover administration. It should be noted that the U.S. Department of Labor has great power, and all matters related to foreigners entering the country and immigration are within its jurisdiction. Although its original purpose was to protect domestic laborers from the intrusion of foreign laborers, in reality, it was a manifestation of the anti-foreign movement. Initially, various immigration regulations were specifically aimed at Asians, so it was very difficult for Chinese workers to enter the United States, and they were often imprisoned for some violations of regulations and waited to be sent back to China on the original ship. Now, the immigration regulations have become stricter, and people from European countries are also subject to restrictions, and it is not limited to workers, but involves people in the film industry. It is said that in principle, whether they are actors, technicians, or workers in the film industry, or ordinary laborers, they are the same - one more foreigner eating means one less local person eating. Therefore, the Department of Labor wanted to expel all foreign stars, technicians, etc., but forgot their great contributions to helping and creating the American film industry's hegemony!</p>
<p>Now it's good. Since President Roosevelt took office, Ms. Francis Perkins has been appointed as the Minister of Labor. Mr. Garsen, the Deputy Director who was most active in expelling foreign actors, has been transferred to another position and replaced by a more moderate person. After taking office, Ms. Francis Perkins immediately informed the Hollywood film industry that the thorough investigation that had been vigorously implemented had been stopped. She also said that the country is now in a time of many troubles, and they cannot attend to such small matters, and so on.</p>
<p>In President Roosevelt's inaugural address, we can find the words "good neighbor." Since he uses "good neighbor" as his motto, of course, it is not appropriate for him to scold the neighbor's children in Hollywood and send them back to their neighbors by pulling their ears. Moreover, if the United States does this, it is tantamount to suicide. Currently, European countries such as England and Germany are still making every effort to recruit outstanding American film talents. People such as gold-throated Ginny MacDonald, dance queen Pipita Niel, and Constance Cummings, Anda Lewis, etc., have already been absorbed by Europe. If the United States further intends to reject national talents, wouldn't it be seeking its own decline and promoting its own decline?</p>

<h3 id="e245">Review of "The Big Drive" <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Big Drive</p>
<p>On-site photography in the European War</p>
<p>Edited from newsreels</p>
<p>Editing fragmented newsreels into an entire film has been recognized as a new film-making method in the Soviet Union, but it is a difficult task, especially in terms of Montage.</p>
<p>Not long ago, China had various films of volunteer army operations, such as "The Bloody History of the Northeast Volunteer Army," etc. Of course, those works would not satisfy us very much in terms of photography and editing, but they are worthy of our attention in the sense of encouraging revolutionary national wars.</p>
<p>Then, how is "The Big Drive," which premiered at the Carlton yesterday? It is also a war newsreel, plus some model "fantasy photography" and after-the-fact performances of hand-to-hand combat. Because in battlefield photography, Camera men must avoid shell fire, so direct conflict scenes are difficult to capture. In this film, what we can see are troops leaving, inspections by senior officers and even the king. Cannons, tanks, submarines, torpedoes, airplanes, bombs, corpses, crosses in cemeteries.</p>
<p>Indeed, the cruel impression of World War I will never be forgotten in our memory. How many innocent people were driven to the battlefield, although they did not need the war, but in the narrow sense of patriotism, they were encouraged to leave their families and children to kill and even be killed. They bleed, they die, they lie stiff in the trenches, they are buried in mass graves. But the death of every officer is given a soldier's salute, a band's music, a coffin covered with a national flag and a wreath. Of course, this means that those who wear gold-rimmed military hats in life will naturally be majestic and glorious in death. These are most clearly shown in the picture.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are many fake scenes in this film, but the editing is still clear, so to understand the true face of this massacre, this silent film with verbal explanation, "The Big Drive," can also be used as reference material.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Hollywood Engages in Cost-Cutting to Avoid Congressional Intervention <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Lun</p>
<p>The impact of the global economic collapse has affected the United States, especially Hollywood, the world's film capital. In the past, the U.S. government has adopted a policy of non-interference in Hollywood. Now the attitude has suddenly changed, and Congress is preparing to thoroughly investigate the situation of the Hollywood film industry. The investigation includes the production costs of films, the salaries of film stars, the methods of film sales, etc. The high salaries of film stars are known to everyone in the world, but now the company authorities also know the economic difficulties and are thinking about engaging in austerity. In the future, when renewing contracts, the highest salary will probably not exceed two thousand U.S. dollars per week. This is only one-fifth of the peak era and only one-third of the existing contract. In this way, on the one hand, costs can be saved, and on the other hand, congressional intervention can be avoided. It can be said that it is a well-prepared plan that achieves two goals with one move.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Review of "Going to Die on the Battlefield" and "Street Singer" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yannan</p>
<p>(Preface) In all war films and martial arts films, the style is mostly monotonous, but this "Going to Die on the Battlefield" (Private Tones) is unique.</p>
<p>(Synopsis) An American coward is forced to enlist. He disagrees with the adjutant but is attracted to the adjutant's wife, leading to intense animosity. Once, he and the adjutant go on a reconnaissance mission and are captured by the Germans. They eventually escape, but because of the poison gas filling the battlefield, they only find one gas mask. He intends to give it to the adjutant, risking his own escape and ultimately dying from the poison.</p>
<p>(Script) In terms of ethics, this film can be considered to have fulfilled its duty, using motherly love as its core from beginning to end. Until death, the gold coin sent by his mother remains in his hand, which is indeed very touching. However, during the performance, because it leaned too much towards humor and jokes, the script became contradictory. The personality of the secondary character, the adjutant, is not explained at all. And is it really possible for a coward to later "Going to Die on the Battlefield" for a friend?</p>
<p>It's a real question. The depiction of military life and the time after being captured is also exaggerated, making it hard to believe that the American army was so undisciplined and the German army so incompetent? This film is compact from beginning to end, but it is all unreasonable. (Purpose) During the performance, the actions and personalities of every type of person in society are vividly conveyed, adding a lot of power to the script. For example, the depiction of a personal secretary [so-called "flower vase"]'s shamelessness, soldiers [so-called "hillbillies"]' rudeness, etc., can all leave a deep impression.</p>
<p>(Director) Throughout the play, the script has already created many mistakes, and of course it is difficult to correct them on set. However, the director is still worthy of our admiration. Every small segment shows the director's cleverness in interweaving, and nothing is lightly let go. All the strengths in the script are developed and expanded one by one. At the end, although the protagonist dies, the script doesn't seem finished, but it stops abruptly, leaving a lingering aftertaste. However, it is a pity that too much attention was paid to the humorous aspects, and the "quantity" was increased along with the "quality." The short plot actually runs for eighty minutes, which is a bit long.</p>
<p>(Technique) The division of scenes is noteworthy. Many double exposures and collages of small shots are quite captivating. Second is the set design. The scene of artillery fire on the battlefield is very clear. The large sections of military music are also extremely tragic, inspiring the cowardly to stand up. The atmosphere is quite tense. Although there is a lot of dialogue, there is no shortage of humorous sentences. Often one side provokes bursts of laughter. However, the inclusion of many military slang terms and extremely offensive vulgar language is not commendable. Although there are many brilliant aspects of the lighting and photography, I think if the film was not old, then it must have been too careless when developing and printing. There are stripes that look like scratches almost everywhere, which is a real demerit. (Performance) Lee Tracy still has that awkward face and is very good at playing a soldier. There are some similarities (like Pascaud in "Gentlemen of the Army") and there are also many extremely deep inner facial expressions, which is a big improvement compared to previous films. His speech is eloquent, his movements are stiff, and he provides a lot of laughs. The rest of the actors are not bad. It can be said to be serious and humorous at the same time.</p>
<p>(Street Singer) A song film replaces the news, and it's all singing. We know that this is the famous song谱阿斯特屈山's golden voice, which is currently the most popular radio broadcast in the United States. You can hear it clearly here. There is no plot, but for the sake of this beautiful music and jazz songs, which are the most popular in the trend, it is introduced in passing. The description of women as temptations also has some lingering flavor.</p>
<p>(Aside) Two good films are still worth seeing, but the magnificent and solemn translated title "Going to Die on the Battlefield" is inappropriate.</p>

<p>— Luofen</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's literary enthusiasm has recently flourished. He hides alone in his home on the top of Beverly Hills, discarding his treasured pair of worn-out leather shoes, cane, and narrow-brimmed black hat, and grasps a pen all day long, doing that brain-racking work. For months, Chaplin has not left his house. Many people thought he was enjoying himself somewhere, but little did they know that he was diligently working with pen and ink, doing the most arduous work!</p>
<p>Chaplin has been writing for several months, and now the manuscript is complete. The book is called "A Comedian Sees the World," and Chaplin has now taken it to New York for publication. Chaplin's writing is highly praised by readers in Europe and America. He is good at using sharp eyes and flexible penmanship to carefully highlight the essence of life, the hypocrisy of the world, and the contradictions of society. In particular, his works depicting the theatrical world, which are scattered in various magazines and newspapers, are even more popular with readers. Therefore, this "A Comedian Sees the World" will surely be a sensation after its publication.</p>

<p>The newly established Lianxing Film Company has been quite busy since its establishment. The actors and staff have been able to cooperate sincerely and work together in a spirit of common effort, so the future is full of vitality. It has now rented the Yueming Studio on Haig Road, and the filming of its debut work "Crossroads" has begun. The filming of a magnificent nightclub dance hall scene in the debut work is expected to begin around the 10th.</p>
<p>Hengsheng Company's "Spring Tide" has been sent to Beijing for review and has been completed. It could have been screened in Shanghai, but because the pronunciation inside was a bit inappropriate, yesterday the Yueming Song and Dance Troupe's Wang Renmei and others were invited to the Jiande Hall on North Sichuan Road and Fusheng Road to dub it.</p>

<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>Produced by German Film Company, starring an all-female cast</p>
<p>A line of dawn, radiating from the east! The dark earth is gradually becoming bright. Everything on the earth seems to be welcoming with a smile: "Light! Light! Come quickly!" Then, a series of wake-up bells broke the sweet dreams of the girls. One by one, they left their lovely beds, took their towels, and headed towards the bathroom. Inside the bathroom, there were rows of wooden cage-like bathing rooms on both sides, with a corridor in the middle. While bathing, many little girls would stretch out their toes to admire the beauty of their curves; some would take out a mirror to look at themselves with infatuation; some would stand in the corridor, giggling and joking. But Manuela, she was leaning against the wall in the bathing room, staring straight at the ceiling above, savoring the taste of last night's kiss.</p>
<p>Around a long table in the office, the principal and several teachers were sitting together, discussing teaching policies. Miss von Bernhard stepped forward and said seriously: "In my opinion, the teachers' room should be a good companion for the students and should not adopt oppressive measures." The principal retorted with an expression of dissatisfaction: "Then how can you maintain your dignity? In such a public group, favoritism can make them suffer from depression. Obeying discipline is the only unchangeable school motto." Those teachers who followed the trend of flattery all agreed repeatedly. Frustrated, Miss von Bernhard argued strongly with them: "But my method has already achieved great success in the exams." Everyone unexpectedly revealed mocking expressions and said: "That's too funny!" Seeing this situation, Miss von Bernhard had no choice but to sigh and remain silent.</p>
<p>This day happened to be Bible class, which was taught by Miss von Bernhard. Miss von Bernhard walked onto the podium and began to question the students' homework. As soon as Manuela saw Miss von Bernhard, she seemed lost. While Miss von Bernhard was questioning other students, she stared infatuatedly at Miss von Bernhard without blinking. When Miss von Bernhard asked about her course, she stammered and could not answer. After Miss von Bernhard finished questioning others, she ran to her side and said to her very gently: "You haven't memorized your homework. I hope you won't do this again next time." Manuela blushed with shame and could not say a word. (To be continued)</p>
