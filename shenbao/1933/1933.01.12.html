<h3>「抗爭」之事實如何　力</h3>
<p>暴日於囊括我東北之後復悍然不顧一切進佔榆關國疆日蹙國勢日危舉國人民罔不痛憤即前此日倡持重之論者今似亦多翻然改圖主張以實際之抗爭挽我民族於垂危如張學良氏之演説如閻錫山韓復榘諸氏之通電甚至正酣於内戰之劉湘亦表示「將結束内戰一致對外」不可謂非舉國一致矣然而榆關被佔亦已逾旬事實上我當局所以應付此事件者仍不外爲對日本發出抗議對國聯繼續陳訴則所謂實際抗爭之主張何在耶</p>
<p>吾人認爲事至今日即三尺之童亦已瞭然於當前日帝國主義者之侵略暴行决非「抗議」以至「嚴重抗議」所能阻遏彼之大陸政策已思之熱而籌之審世界公論且悍然不顧更復何有於虚聲之「抗議」而國聯之本身即適爲强　之集團　一年以來之事實蓋亦可以證明「公理」之終不可以呼籲而致今日雖再瀝陳哀訴又寗其有效故今日之事惟「拼死命」乃足以「爭生存」乃足以「致公理」乃足以阻遏帝國主義者之暴行此蓋爲天經地義絶無可疑者捨此而言救國皆爲空談</p>
<p>日帝國主義者今日之侵略暴行固足以使全世界爲之震驚但另一方面我國之極度的退讓與極度的忍耐備受蹂躪而絶不反抗此種懦弱之表示蓋亦爲今日世界所僅見夫惟我有極度之退讓與忍耐乃有此悍然毫無顧忌之强敵嚮使瀋變爆發之初我國即拼命抵抗當亦不致毫無顧忌若此而乃隠忍遷延坐待宰割緩則恬然若無事急則乞助於他人今日榆關再失日軍前進不已所以致此夫豈無困</p>
<p>日昨本報北平通信記東省某外報評論謂「中華民族實一惰性民族對付此種惰性民族日本所採之手段至爲正當若以此種手段移而加於西方任何民族恐無一日之安矣」云云其言雖狂妄然而他山之石可以攻錯吾人於此亦應鄭重三思意相墨索里尼有言「言辭固美槍砲尤美」全世界任何一國所不能忍受之恥辱所不能忍受之　痛吾人乃欲以抗議呼　等等之「言詞」解决一切其可得耶</p>
<p>總之今日事已至急再不容徘徊觀望飄揚於山海關頭之太陽旗章隨時可以進而飄揚於北京城頭甚至揷遍我全國忍耐應有盡時退讓亦應有止境舉國人民今日都屬望於我政府有事實之昭示此種事實非爲「調停」非爲「談判」非爲「抗議」非爲「陳訴」乃爲一實際之行動今日之事究將如何</p>
<h3>美遠東政策無變更</h3>
<p>羅斯福與史汀生晤談後</p>
<p>認目下無重行申明必要</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務卿史汀生前往紐約、與新總統羅斯福會晤已畢、今晚可回華盛頓、政界深知羅斯福拒絶與胡佛合作、此次之與史汀生會晤、不過詢問事實而已、故一般人對於此事、不甚注意、聞羅斯福對於史汀生遠東政策、大體贊成、惟以爲美國對遠東之見地、目下無重行聲明之必要、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>▲大阪朝日新聞華盛頓特電　榆關事件勃發後、美國國務省當局雖頗沈靜、然今後之發展實堪憂慮、蓋由美國官方觀之、咸謂「美國之政策、以爲史汀生國務卿對於去年一月七日之對日通牒、及二月四日外交委員長波拉氏所提出之文書中、切實表明、以後無論如何、决無變更原議』之意、由此可以推知不承認滿洲國主義、雖至次期大總統羅斯福時代、恐無特别變更方針、目下美政府以日本軍萬一逾越萬里長城而侵入中國本土時、對於平和條約必引起重大新問題、一方勢必與蘇俄聯邦、釀成糾紛云云、現胡佛任期内之政府因新舊更迭伊邇、缺乏權威、故不致有如何行動、例如戰債問題、亦若中日問題之迄無進展、蓋胡佛與羅斯福二人之協商、均不願有積極的决定、最近出淵大使爲榆關事件、訪問國務次官喀士爾、與中國公使館一等秘書之訪問極東局長洪佩克、美國官方均不願發表任何意見云、</p>
<h3>胡佛向國會提議禁運軍火出口</h3>
<p>原案一再修改實際等於具文</p>
<p>足覘製造商左右政府之勢力</p>
<p>日内瓦公約參院未必能批准</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統胡佛今日向國會提出禁運軍火出口案、但其内容已非如國務院最初所原擬者、已將『總統得隨時禁止出口』修改爲『總統獲得他國合作後得限制軍火出口』故國會中人多謂由此可覘美國軍火製造商左右國家政策之勢力、蓋此案經此修改後、在實際絶少效用、幾等具文矣、美總統同時又送一特别報告、勸參議院批准一九二五年六月十七日日内瓦所訂禁販軍火之國際公約、謂若此約不能批准、則國會亟須通過一案、授權總統俟取得軍火主要製造國合作後、即禁止輸運軍火出口、供軍事之用、此外又抄附國務卿史汀生致總統函、内容即係建議應由總統請國會授權政府、禁止運輸軍火往戰爭國家、以期增進非戰公約之效力、按此案國務院擬定已多時、擱置白宮、至今日始送交國會、而其在送交國會前、又加以修改者、即因某某數閣員與軍火製造商反對故也、據聞其中有一節竟完全改易、其他規定亦多修改處、所以國會議員多稱此案效用絶微、此案送達國會後、參議員波拉立即聲稱、參院外交委員會將於明日考慮日内瓦公約、按該公約擱置參院已數年、未曾加以表决、惟據波拉表示、委員會内對該公約恐未必定予贊成通過也、同時國務院助理國務卿羅傑士又在參院外交委員會宣稱、當選總統羅斯福對於美國出席國際軍縮會議之計劃、仍可自由决定、國務院未嘗接受任何拘束、亦未同意其議程云、（十日國民電）</p>
<h3>美參議員主張締結國際新約</h3>
<p>擁護史汀生政策</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美參議員金氏認凱洛非戰公約、頗少維持世界和平效力、今日特在參院提出决議案、請訂結一國際新約、擁護美國不承認武力所取領土之政策、主張授權總統、商訂國際條約、禁用武力　奪領土、以免發生戰事、蓋金氏之意、認各國可訂結一約、對於不宣而戰與宣戰後所獲得之領土·皆屬非法行爲、按金氏爲民主黨員、照其提議此種公約、當然將由民主黨政府辦理、（十日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）外務當局對於史丹林在共黨中央委會之演説、謂日軍部於明年度預算、所以要求龐大軍事費之眞理由、因蘇俄一面對日要求締結不侵犯條約、一面將全國工業準備戰爭之故、因此於今日俄締結不侵犯條約之可能性、已成最後的消滅云、（十一日電通社電）</p>

<h3>中俄復交後政府亟應溝通外蒙貿易</h3>
<p>全國商聯會昨電呼籲</p>

<p>全國商會聯合會昨分電國府行政院及外交實業兩部、電云、南京國民政府行政院外交部實業部鈞鑒、頃准察哈爾全省商民請願代表李　山·任玉衡·崔　玉·程範菴·王　亭·等　開、查我國</p>
<h3>外蒙本屬國家領土</h3>
<p>之一部、其幅員之廣　、藴藏之豐富、殆甲於内地之數省、在政治方面、旣可爲我國之屏藩、在經濟方面、更足資民生之尾閭、而外蒙人民、本爲國内同一民族、風俗習慣、並無畛域、且彼此生活關係、更有供需不可分離之勢、所以互通有無兩有利益、適合於共存共榮之原理者、頗有極綿長之歷史、乃自蘇俄國家政革後、新潮推播、蒙民思想、爲之丕變、靑年份子、感情衝動、易受社會主義偏頗之激盪、遂改變外向心理、甘受蘇俄卵翼、並於民國十三年、在庫組織政府、意欲</p>
<h3>脱我國宗主關係</h3>
<p>從此我内地與外蒙、在政治方面、即發生最大之變化、而經濟方面、内地與外蒙貿易亦遽然斷絶、迨中俄兩國因東鐡問題交涉破裂之後、蒙民之情緖薄弱者、更表現進一步仇視華商之意、自此我華商在庫經理生業者、頓受極端之苛虐待遇、不但財産被没收、人權被蹂躪、且無出入遷徒之自由、居住營業之自由矣、我在庫數十萬華商、犴狴生活、席日如歲、其痛苦悲慘之情狀、眞有罄竹難書者、而我政府對於外蒙之失守、旣無法收復、對於旅庫商民、更無方救濟、致我内地人民、與外蒙有最密切關係之張家口、一切商務、宣告破産矣、現在</p>

<p>即當急起直追、將挽救之策、提出對俄交涉、此應請詳籌挽救策略者一也、再查張家口與外蒙之通商關係、自外蒙經濟封銷、拒絶華商入境後、在内地方面對蒙貿易、旣然停頓、蒙貨輸入、亦同時停滯、供需兩方、俱受極重大之影響、由互利關係、變爲敵對關係者、已數年於茲、然推究原因、皆在中俄兩國情感未能融治、而蒙民對内觀念薄弱、向俄表示親密之結果、自然與蘇俄行動一致、此種事實、熟悉外蒙内情者、皆能道之、所以目下華商損失雖達四五萬萬元之譜、而彼外蒙人民、物質需要所感受之缺乏、亦成較爲嚴重之情勢、此中關鍵之先决問題、固在中俄兩國之能否諒解、如中俄確能恢復友誼關係、我國外交當局、自然能對症投藥、將内地與外蒙之隔閡、由</p>
<h3>蘇俄負責和平解决</h3>
<p>保全原來親善之事實、創内地之民生國計、旣可得有相當收獲、而外蒙與中俄間豁然通達生計需要、亦自能解除極大之困難、一轉移間、數善俱備、此應請政府外交部對於張庫恢復通商互利關係、定爲對俄首先交涉之要件者又一也、再查我國對俄貿易、原來即是落後、所運出之貨物、以滿洲大豆爲大宗、而張家口方而出境之貨物、多係絲茶諸品、盡屬農産、並無工業出産品之輪出、徒供他人原料之用、毫無製造之能、而在資本方面、率皆私人以小資經營、並無國營　營任何貿易公司之組設、現在蘇俄經濟政策、正在極盛時代、而工業五年計劃又施行、有極大之交率、以國家之資本、與私人之資本對抗、俄國商業、必操勝算無疑、我國商民對外貿易之發展、恐無希望、况我所運出者、只數種原料品、輪入者爲多數製造品、其入超之現象、固所難免、而商業之競爭、更要失敗、此爲極當注意者、</p>

<p>恐慌週期律與「反帝」問題</p>
<p>丨丨汪洗平君來信丨丨</p>
<p>記者先生：貴報前昨兩日乃君的「一九三三年如何」的時評，在現在的言論界爲晨雞，在貴報亦爲鑒光，捧讀之下，不能不歎爲「空谷足音！」惟是乃君所言，猶有數事不能爲愚蒙所解者，特提出如下，敬質高明：（一）乃君説：「制度之必須變更，正如人生之必須經生老病死而更替，故所謂「恐慌週期」云者，非爲走馬燈式的循環，而爲螺旋式的前進。······「歲月催人老」者，恐慌週期亦在繼續不斷的催促。現制度由幼穉而全盛，由全盛而衰亡。現制度之必須在某一恐慌之下，壽終正　者，吾人廻溯人類社會之歷史，旁察一般人生的過程，而知其無可避免也。」這段话我完全贊成。老成持重如貴報竟然有這種暴露現社會之必然運命的勇敢的言論，一來表現貴報記者已經踏進了新時代的外圍；二來也是證明時代的黑暗已經快達到與光明交界的地方，這一層是値得我們謳歌的。但是乃君又説：「吾人對於恐慌週期律，並不欲加以根本之否認，惟有須加以修正者，」觀其所謂修正，大致如前如引，認定恐慌週期律「非爲走馬燈式的」，「而爲螺旋式的，」意在言外，是説從前主張恐慌週期律乃是「走馬燈式的，」而非螺旋式的，乃君之言，果屬確實否？（二）乃君説：「犧牲之意義已明，苦厄之價値已定，則更應磨礪以須，謳歌而近，奮起以與侵略之國家作殊死戰。殖民地與次殖民之反帝　爭，旣爲現時代計無所出，逼不獲已之一著，則唯有一致興起，肉搏而前，······」這一段很興奮的話，自然也是我們靑年人人心中所欲説而不能説，或説之而不能如是之沉痛慷慨的，然而假定我們現在要實行反帝工作，實行如乃君所指示「一致興起」，我恐怕不等到「肉搏而前」大家都已「捉將官　官去了。」那還有你」肉搏而前的機會？區區之愚，以爲中國不欲實行反帝，不過嘴上説説，打打電報，做做文章，那就罷了；果然要眞正反帝，那就要有三個先决條件：無條件地實現民主國家的三大自由；無條件地大開黨禁；無條件地普赦政治犯。這三個條件若一條辦不到，那反帝便是一句騙人的空話。要知道古今中外的歷史，没有那一個民族或國家，把國民大多數弄成死氣沉沉，連屁都不敢放的狀態，能以與外强相見於　塲的。所以我以爲必須人民要求政府，或由政府自動地馬上實現上述三個先决條件，才有「反帝」「抗日」可言。貴報記者以爲如何？</p>
<p>記者按：汪君來信，對於本報乃君所作時評，有如此精詳之討論，備見平日研究學問之精神，欽佩之至！所陳兩點，除望本報記者乃君作覆外，讀者諸君如有高見·亦請惠函討論。</p>
<h3>關於中蘇復交問題之討論</h3>
<p>丨丨方覺華君來信丨丨</p>
<p>（吳冷秋君原函見十二月二十八日本欄）</p>
<p>記者先生對於吳冷秋君來訊所提各問題中，拈出絶交是誰要絶的？而復交又是誰要復的一問題？爲各種問題的主體，實在一些不差。我以爲，對俄絶交的起因，一半是爲了國人對於蘇聯没有充分的認識和了解，一半因爲外交處於不自動的地位，所以就盲然地絶交了。現在呢，國人對於牠已經有了相當的認識，同時，在外交方面，因有嚴重的國難，揭破了帝國主義者的面具，覺悟到從前阿諛帝國主義者失策，所以，毅然地復交了。至於將來是否會再行絶交，全看政府能否保持其眞正自主外交的精神爲斷。總之，對俄復交，我們旣不必欣歡，也不要恐懼，當前的國難，還是要靠自已的力量來解决的。二十世紀的時代，不是關了門就可以避免外來的侵略。我們所應抱的態度，是仇人少一個好一個，朋友不要被敵人用了去。對俄絶交後所受的影響，是革命外交處於孤立的地位，在國際間却博得一句采聲。帝國主義們都説中國確是可兒，深解人意。現在已告復交了，他們學得東方的巨人，已漸漸醒來因此都懷一種疑忌的心理，深怕兩大民族携手，給資本主義的他們一種有力的咸脅。但是我們眞能因此而站起身來嗎。在我看來，不過是衰頽的勞病鬼。打一針興奮劑了吧！</p>

<h3>日本的妓女</h3>
<p>— 洽</p>
<p>抗日聲中談到日本的妓女，似乎有些無聯；但據從日本回來的朋友講，日本妓女從未拿非日貨的烟酒敬客，這一點似乎値得注意。回顧到尊重來路貨的中國，妓女固然是外國貨的義務推銷員，可是恬不爲怪的以服用外貨爲闊綽的，又何祇被一般人們所輕視的妓女呢！</p>
<p>日本妓女何以這般的愛國呢，因爲她們對於自已的國貨早有了信仰和决心，固然也由於社會習尙的轉移，但是寧可用次一等的日貨而堅拒非日貨。</p>
<p>烟酒本來是消耗的東西，往妓寮嘗試烟酒尤其是出於生活的正軌的；但依此類推，我們在消除所謂來路貨好的劣根性以前，倘若第一步不以用次一等的國貨爲恥，果能行之有恒，的確可以從鉅額的人超統計圖表上挽回一部分漏　。</p>
<h3>在重重壓迫下國貨該怎樣謀出路（二）</h3>
<p>— 杜重達</p>
<p>在農業經濟崩潰之途程中·　　之工業經濟，因亦漸次産生，迄於今日·多數的都市都已進入資本主義之領域·即農村經濟也逐漸轉變其性質。但此種團變、乃是資本主義經濟勢力所作成、而非由於自然的　變。所以我國今日之所謂民族工業，亦遂無不爲資本主義先進國家所操　把持，一息奄奄，仰人爲活，處於極悲慘之地位。</p>
<p>特别是自從一九二九年七月經濟恐慌的狂潮自美國發動以來，蔓延到全歐資本主義各國·而形成爲全世界資本主義國經濟恐慌的尖鋭化。在這種情形之下，資本主義　欲保全自已最後一口殘喘，唯一的法門，自惟有獎勵輸出與限制輸入。在後一政策之下，即爲高築關税壁壘，以抵制外貨的輸入。這就是所謂和平的關税戰爭。而在前一政策之下即爲加緊對弱小民族與殖民地的榨壓，使其更貧困化，同時更榨取其賤價的原料，甚且進一步作重新瓜分世界之打算。</p>
<p>國貨論壇</p>
<h3>國貨年應有之工作</h3>
<p>— 潘仰芥</p>
<p>爲了要養成國人對於國貨的信仰和决心，中華民國二十二年被特定爲國貨年；自今年元旦開幕禮行過以後，這三百六十五日的光陰便時時刻刻都負著重大使命在進行·不能一時或懈的完成此項工作·在這政治的經濟的重重國難之下，能從事雪恥禦侮的實際工作，國貨年實在是很有意義和價値的一件事情；可是耕耘後才得有收穫，我們應把一切標語和口號實現以後，理想中的成功才右以到達。所以，國貨年開始的時候，我們莫把開幕禮的宣傅認爲工作完畢，在開幕禮以後，我們即須負起這艱苦的重責，寳貴著分秒的光陰，於努力工作之中走上未來成功的大道。完成了國貨年應有之工作，我們方不辜負元旦日含有重大意義的開幕禮，才不虚度負有重大使命的國貨年！</p>
<p>我們究竟如何能養成國人對於國貨的信仰和决心？分析近今的國難情境，固然可以打動一般人的感情。但是根據市塲學的理論，　著重金廣告費和極大推銷力的外貨，時時給我新興工商業以威脅；而且事實更告訴我們，在外貨充斥的中國市塲上，要建樹國貨的信仰心，除去提倡服用國貨以外，更得有生産推銷種種的協力的改進，才能在商戰的攻守兩方獲到勝利。在國貨年中，我們爲著禦侮雪恥和建樹國貨的信仰心，自然不能努力這項重要工作；可是運銷生産各方面本身已是件複雜的問題，在這短短的一年中，我們倘没有科學的設計，則常因顧此失彼而遷延時日，所以爲要加緊和專一起見，最好在國貨年中，以月爲單元，每月舉行一個具體運動。關於生産和銷售方面，如生産的改進，勞資的協調，人事的注意，金融的周轉等等，本來是專門問題，不是短時期所能解决的，可是在國貨年運動中却又是基本工作，不能因其繁雜而放棄·假如指定一月專門研究討論和實騐，當能獲得實效。所以，我們希望國貨年的十二個月，都負有使命而不使虚度，因需要和程序的先後，分别研究（一）生産的改進；（二）推銷的努力；（三）解除運輸上的困難；（四）金融的周轉；（五）工廠標準化；（六）原料問題；（七）成本减輕問題；（八）如何投合各地人民習尚；（九）販賣員的訓練；（十）勞工問題；（十一）生産販賣消費之協作；（十二）消費合作之實施；從國貨生産銷售各方面，謀根本的改進，建樹國貨的標準化，使國人對於國貨之信仰心鞏固，完成國貨年的意義和使命。</p>
<p>國貨年的地域對象本來不限於一地，上海不過是此次運動的　矢，可是在這外貨深入内地的畸形局面下，國貨運動倘不自一地擴大到各地，自城市擴大到鄉村，廣大的市塲却仍未能從外貨手中奪回。所以，在上海國貨運動具體實施以後，我們更應到内地去，建樹全國民衆對於國貨的信仰，鼓勵全國民衆服用國貨的决心。可是在内地的國貨運動，不必專用文字或口頭的宣傳，最近廣州靑島河南鎭江無錫蘇州各地所舉行的國貨展覽會，將我們原有的和新創造的國産貨物，介紹於一般市民之前，效力很大，各地的敎育機關和實業團體，可以仿行，至於各地原有特産，經過展覽和提倡以後，關於生産方面，再加改良，在這農村經濟瀕於危殆之際，因了提倡副業而解决許多生活困難的人們。</p>
<p>在國貨年我們的應有之工作，除去每月作小單元的實際運動和推廣國貨運動往各地以外，我們應在各地多設國貨介紹機關，使消費者認識國貨，更將新興的國産貨品介紹至各地。近今上海中華國貨産銷合作協會，中華國貨指導所，以及重慶國貨介紹所，多是負著此項使命努力的進行，成績很好；靑島和汕頭的實業界，亦多有見於此，已經著手在籌備中。我們果能從以上已經設立而有成績的國貨介紹機關做出發點，逐漸推廣，對於這次熱烈的國貨運動，實有很大的帮助！</p>
<h3>吾國紡織業今後之出路（中）　朱仙航</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>（甲）營業合理化···不尙投機···出口求簡單···原棉求常符標準（乙）工作合理化···節縮開支（丙）政府勵行保護政策（丁）金融界據大紡織投資爲有力之合作（戊）國人購用國産織物</p>
<p>乙　工作合理化</p>
<p>工業合理化者，標準化，簡單化，科學管理之總稱也，歐戰後創始於德，，崩潰工業，賴以復興，各國踵行，亦均推行盡利，吾爲工業落後之國，固宜急起勵行，矧國外棉貨傾銷，吾國紡織業根本有搖動可能，尤非積極施行，無以挽衷頽之局勢，所謂標準化，簡單化，科學管理，係合機械與工作而言，機械部分，已詳見拙著「紡織合理化工作法」，其大要在使工程趨於簡單，發揮效率，增加生産，以减輕成本，就工作之合理化言之，則唯節縮開繳，發揮勞工本能，减少人數，優其資給，使個人所得可增，而工貿總數則减，開繳爲利息·工貲，物料，　力俸給，雜支之總稱，而工貲數爲最巨，亦最富有伸縮性，同一工作也，有數人而始舉，有一人而優爲之，在數人爲一工作時，因需維持數人生活，故個人所得之數雖少，其總數恒較一人爲同一工作之所得爲多，所得較少，每感生計困難，孰若發揮其本能，减少人數，優其貲給，以减少工貲總額而節縮開繳乎，他若動力物料，亦須隨技術進步，使工程趨於簡單，而求節縮其量，開繳節縮，則成本輕，雖以廉價出售，使得暢銷，仍不致蒙受虧折，例如成本能减輕一兩，在他人原本出售時，吾可得一兩利益，在他人虧本一兩時，吾可不稍受損，吾紡織業能勵行工作合理化，更何彼紗布傾銷之足憂。</p>
<h3>工業談屑</h3>
<p>— 灭然</p>
<p>一昨往訪歸自歐美考察之化學工業家吳君藴初，所言頗足爲讀者談助。</p>
<p>吳君之考察，爲時五月餘，足跡遍歐美日本南洋各邦，費銀二萬元而所得無量，聞其考察時，竟日不倦，夜間撰報告，記心得，作書函，有時入圖書館研究，有時至試騐室化騐，孜孜不倦，其樂陶陶，可佩可佩。吳君云：不久將擴充二工廠，期於國産化學工業上，有巨大之貢獻。</p>
<p>吳君云，歐美工業之不景氣，已達極點，工人每星期只有工作五天，每天只有工作五小時，而失業者尙無數，半由世界各購買力之鋭减，半由科學管理進步之神速，小工廠之用人工與半機械者，已無立足之地。</p>
<p>吳言云，利用機械萬能，科學管理進步以後已使世界人工均退歸於無用之地，機器日高明，人力日淘汰，吳君觀一大炭氣廠，規模極大，均用機械發動，而職工僅三人云</p>
<h3>編餘</h3>
<p>友人陸君新自日本考察工藝歸，談及日人之經營工業，輙用全副精神，埋頭死做，中經任何艱難困苦，不肯罷休，有一製筆鉛者，已有三十年歷史，髮已頒白，皃子已卒業大學，亦助之工作，不厭倦，不敬且，不取巧，不貪小科，不求近功，故能出品精，成本輕，而有日新月異之成績，陸君下不勝其感偑。日本固我仇，顧其經營工業之精神與毅力，不可謂非吾師也。</p>
<p>山海關　聲，吾人試一閉目，當回憶及於一二八閘北之慘狀，當國家危急時，吾國貨工廠之所以自效於國家者，宜有準備。聞日本在戰事吃緊時，有將製造商品之工廠，改造軍用品者，如製罐廠之改製炸彈，棉織廠之改製軍衣，搪瓷鋼精廠之改製鐡帽水瓶等等，友人自日本歸者，曾得其各工廠改製軍用品之計畫書，讀之令人爲之悚然。同是國民，同依國家以生存，國難至於如此，實業家報國之道，此其時矣。</p>
<p>『很好的許多外貨，還没有國貨，辦工廠的應趕快想法國貨替代品才是。』</p>
<p>這名現成話，大家都能説。可是辦國貨工廠的前提，是經濟和人才。試問在目前狀態之下，國貨廠商没有周轉金，金融家是否肯眞心誠意的切實輔助？國貨廠商没有眞人才，敎育機關是否能虚心努力的陶鑟靑年，以供工廠需用？如果是没有這誠心，這力量，説話任你説得好聽，也是絲毫無補，還是免開尊口。</p>
<p>自從重慶組織了國貨介紹所以後，大家都希望各地陸續的仿辦起來，果然最近李祖模君自靑島來，謂已組織了一個山東國貨介紹所，石夢鶴君自汕頭來，謂將組織一個汕頭國貨介紹所，廣西民政廳長雷蔚南君，也説回到廣西·蔣組織一個廣西國貨介紹所。這種風發雲湧的國貨介紹所，都在這國貨年中呱呱墮地，十分可喜，上海方面，有行將開幕之中國國貨公司，這種消息，都是於國貨推銷上有很大的助力。希望各地積極進行，互相聯絡。以吾想來，如漢口，如天津，如廣州，如福州，如鄭州，如太原，都有辦國貨介紹所之可能。同時吾們在滬廠商，組織國貨旅行團，親往各地實地參觀考察，爲更進一步之聯絡，那麽不致辜負這國貨年了。</p>
<p>本期承各處惠稿很多，大部分是很有價値，不過限於篇幅，吾們祇得陸續發表，希望大家鑒諒！</p>
<h3>推銷國貨之討論</h3>
<p>— 曹亦民</p>
<p>曹君留美專攻科學管理及推銷問題現任三友實業社人事科長，茲文就其經騐所得，頗有價値。（編者）</p>
<p>民國二十二年定爲國貨年，那麽在此年内；無論個人，家庭，或團體購買物品，必須先從國産中揀選，然而何謂國産？何謂舶來品？很難鑑别，雖名稱爲國貨商店，其中未免仍有舶來品混入；因貪圖漁利，往往有改頭換面之貨物出現於市塲，購買者，當作國貨買了回去，後經别人證實這是舶來品；因此他必甚是懊惱，甚至灰心再去購買國貨，這實辜負樂用國貨者一般熱忱，我個人也曾遇過以上的事實，以個人的意思；最好請商會在熱鬧之區設一個商品陳列館，非但陳列國産，同時并陳列舶來品，國貨與舶來品陳設一橱，加以分析和標識，在羣衆觀望之下，能知孰優孰劣；熱心愛國之土必樂意購用國貨，同時也能增進羣衆鑑别國産智識，并希望各大公司也採用此種鑑别陳列法，這就管見所及之一點。另一點關於國貨商塲中之店員；在國貨商塲中之職員，須了解本人責任之重大，在國貨商塲中之營業員，是有主義爲國家求生存，爲民族爭光榮之先鋒軍，他的功績等於前線的戰士；所以此種職員，絶對要犧牲個人，勇於服務之精神，那麽對於日常工作，必富有進取性，招待主顧必能週到盡職，務使買主滿意，使買主樂意下次再來購買國貨；不致以像普通商店之店員老下逐客令，使買客交易一回，下次再不願光顧之惡感，希望主理國貨公司之領袖們，對於這問題切實注意之。</p>

<h3>西靑女籃球會結束兩江勝綠隊保持錦標</h3>

<p>陳榮明表演驚人全場獨步</p>
<h3>東南隊亞軍</h3>

<p>▲兩江隊死裏逃生</p>
<h3>陳榮明一手撑天下</h3>
<p>兩江能得勝勁敵、由大敗而反成勝利、大功當歸中鋒陳榮明、其動作之靈敏穏速、一時難得看見、從左右沿邊衝入籃下之投球、當暵爲觀止、兩江三十二分中、獨得二十四分、眞非容易、潘夢雖未得分、輔佐之功不小、亦能東西穿跑、楊森未展其長、後衛之中、黃淑華全塲　楚、異軍突出、截得之球無數、陳白雪石瑞霞、克盡厥職、不因人小而减色、表演殊令人滿意、</p>
<h3>上塲大敗綠隊逞凶</h3>
<p>兩江上塲、一副失敗局面、滿塲人人無不爲危、雖爲陳榮明一罰先開紀錄、但綠隊憑其高大之身材、二三傳遞、卽達籃下、一投而中、前鋒亦殊難得球、綠隊健將費拉畢玲路等、一中再中、一連投入六球之多、綠隊十二、兩江尙祇一分、經陳榮明之奮鬥、第一節結果、十四比六大敗、</p>
<h3>逐步上追形勢漸變</h3>

<h3>兩江轉機一躍居上</h3>
<p>下半時之形勢、兩江由大敗而追上、復超出而一躍反居上面、綠隊至此、全陣動搖、擲籃不中、心慌意亂、陳榮明一轉身衝入籃下、連中三元、遂以二十比十分超出綠隊居其上矣、復成二十四比十八、第三節完畢、二十四比二十二分、最後一塲陳榮明又告成功、最大比數以三十二比二十四勝八分、結果三十二比二十八、裁判凱末爾女士及舒鴻、</p>

<p>晨開卽較前收跌有五兩、爲七百九十八兩半、物品套轉條子、而爲九兩、（物口開八兩八錢）銀行開盤英美俱硬、而不見應手者、乾昌祥首售、降爲九十八兩光景、大德成亦出、跌至七兩、銀行内盤四月份美金做三一二五、慶發永亦賣出、須臾之間、降至六兩内、　雖不多、但應手非易、故爲九十五兩八錢、恒餘乾昌祥見低價而進、價雖略升、但未猛漲、仍見其在七八兩間徘徊、蓋永豐兆豐昌於此際不時售條也、及至正月份美金零六二五、正金要吃、恒興恒餘大德成爭購、正金又吃正月美金已二十八元、乃漲至九十九兩七錢、無如八百兩大關飛鳥難越、銀行内盤四月份美金二五不能售去、永豐等續出、跌爲七兩、花旗結三月美金一八七五、恒餘大德成亦乘機來進、復升至九兩五錢、匯豐掛牌毫不留情、英大一二五、美復長二五、人心乃虚、價漸下游、雖有恒興在八兩三錢限價而購、但大勢之欲降、乃時間問題耳、除略爲停頓外、即現猛烈之跌風、蓋匯市四月美金二五、銀行肯售、立降三兩餘、爲九十六兩、中央銀行開現之訊傳來、塲内恒興乾昌祥進條、志豐永恒餘則出、價略進退於七兩内外、然四月美金已硬至三一二五、銀行肯賣、大德成恒餘大連帮等均售、散户跟踪競賣、價乃不支、三七五四月美金亦至不易售出、元亨猛出、物品亦連續出條、慘跌五兩餘、爲七百九十二兩五錢、此後中央卽源源而來、開現不已、恒興首進、加至四兩、正月一八七五三井買進、源茂永兆豐昌來購、升至六兩一錢、人心浮虚、把握不定、恒興代客出一百零五條、仍退至三兩半光景、三井再吸四月份美金三七五、恒餘恒興乾昌祥春源永均進、又抬至五兩、大興永乃出、是以復回至九十四兩半收盤、物品因收盤前賣出、至此乃於競爭中復進條子、故物品拍九十五兩收盤、查半日間最高價七百九十九兩七錢、最低七百九十二兩五錢、有七兩二錢上落、結果則較前收跌九兩、</p>
<h3>中央開現一千四百餘條</h3>
<p>中央銀行前日稍形靜默後、昨市又見活動、計半日間共開現貨五六次、由大德成同豐恒乾昌祥恒興等代進期標數共一千四百餘條、其價大致約與期貨相平、計最高開價九十七兩、最低開價九十三兩、</p>
<h3>面成交低落賣佔優勢</h3>
<p>面上交易慘淡、統計大德成乾昌祥恒興源茂永春源永等乃是買方、大興永福泰亨天豐永源新永等乃是賣方、各現貨號代中央則稍進、代客均出、大連帮略售、廣帮益豐進少出多、恒興則進八九百條、代客出二百餘條、此外各號時出時進、與前如出一貫、</p>
<h3>烚赤去胃雖暢到源亦多</h3>
<p>烚赤市况穏定、蓋因去路殊廣、求者甚切、但以現貨來路亦湧、故價不致有升降、昨市做來甚　、計照加九兩、然成交不多、</p>
<h3>掉期頭寸缺無整數成交</h3>
<p>掉期因各號頭寸均缺、除係代爲解貨外、不見有任何整數成交、昨市因現貨湧到千餘條、現貨號盈豐恒乃貼予恒興一錢半、乃二月份劃賬、代恒興解正月份條子、成交有七百條之巨、可見現貨抵滬、洵非虚語、</p>
<h3>外匯被金價帶硬</h3>
<p>丨洋商銀行進胃續好丨</p>
<p>匯市雖續現鬆勢、但銀行胃口仍好、蓋因金市恍惚、而匯價亦隨之而高低、晨開大條雖微縮零六二五、價匯兑　漲、米能滿意、即較　收反動、計英匯　期　價一先令八便士零六二五、美銀匯告跌一二五、　　期銀價反升一厘餘、本來　一二五之銀價、已不能合前日漲風、再加銀行私電報大一二五、是美金亦虚略硬、故近期開盤二十八元零六二五、人後蹤一度見　、但無如金價猛降、不得不隨之俱硬、但胃口尙好、花旗乃是始終買進、麥加利華比亦進多於出、金業交易不多、大致　者居多、半日間有零六二五至一二五上落、結果英美兩匯俱硬起一八七五之譜、</p>
<p>（英匯）開盤卽趨反動、近期出價一先令八便士零六二五、較前收硬一二五、麥加利進安達出正月份零六二五、匯豐正金對做正月份亦是零六二五、華比出二月份一二五、安達仍售三井吃正月份一二五、交易淸淡、延至收盤時出價正月份一先令八便士零六二五、（或可一二五）、二月與三月同爲一二五、四月分一八七五、進價俱加零六二五、</p>
<p>（美匯）開盤與英匯同樣、較前收硬一二五、計近期出價二十八元零六二五、華比首出中南則進二月一二五、華比進四月份三一二五、又進三月份二五、三井售與正金正月份零六二五、正金又吃同月份祇二十八元、乃麥加利所售、而麥加利隔手進同月零六二五、沙遜出花旗進三月份一八七五、匯豐進興業出正月份零六二五、花旗進三月份二五、正金續吸華比所售正月份二十八元、中孚進三月一八七五、三井售與匯豐正月份零六二五、興業吃進二月份一二五、花旗進四月份三一二五、住友吃同月同價、中孚進三月二五、三井吃四月三七五、中央匯豐對做正月份下半月一八七五、安達出三井扖正月份一二五、華比售二月份一八七五、華比進四月份三七五、華比售與正金正月份一二五、收盤正月份出價二十七元一二五、二月份一八七五、三月份二五、四月份三一二五、進價自一八七五至三七五、美金一元、合銀三兩六錢零三厘六、</p>
<h3>大條續長一二五</h3>
<p>國民社十一日倫敦電、大條續漲、收盤近期十六便士八七五、遠期十六便士九三七五、比上日各長一二五、又英美匯價開三元三角五分七五、</p>
<h3>一年來銀市之回顧</h3>
<p>銀産雖减無補於銀價</p>
<p>原因在中印商務不振</p>
<p>▲恢復中英購買力即可以恢復銀價▲</p>
<p>去年銀市之最重要影響、爲東方需銀之絶對减少、蓋世界産銀有百分之七十五、常爲中國及印度所吸收、而銀産最巨之一九二九年在産額二億六千一是萬兩中、二國所吸收幾佔百分之八十四、去年銀産雖减至一億六千零六十萬兩、而中國印度所消納者、僅五千二百萬兩、祇佔産額百分之三十二而已、</p>
<p>亨特與哈門謂、苟中印二國一變而爲售銀之國、則世界白銀將常站於世界白銀最低紀錄之下、可以無疑、今中國印度實爲世界最大用銀國、以常例論、在此白銀有史以來最低紀錄之際、而反縮小其購買力、此必有故、此種緣故、就吾人經騐所及、非爲銀價之縮小、實爲世界購買中印出口貨之减少而然、</p>
<p>部析銀市不振之故、每以白銀幣制不行爲定評、而實在原因、須由東方增加其購買力、而購買力之增加、須中印二國之貨能暢銷於世界市塲、故二國商業苟能復興、物價增高、則有益於銀市當非淺鮮、</p>
<p>亨德與哈門關於投機殊無貶抑之意、因投機固亦爲調劑市塲所不可少之一端、然對於去年投機家之抬高銀價、認爲不智、蓋銀市始終無穏定理由可以爲投機家之資料也、</p>
<p>據其估計一九三二年銀之産額、約一億六千零六十萬兩、（一九六、一○○、○○○）、其中美國産銀二千三百四十萬兩（三一、四○○、○○○）墨西哥七千一百七十萬兩（八八、九○○、○○○）、坎那大一千八百三十萬兩（二○、四○○、○○○）、南亞非利加一千二百四十萬兩）一九、七○○、○○○）、其他世界各處三千四百八十萬兩（三五、七○○、○○○）</p>
<p>一九三二年舊銀之供給、估計約二千二百六十萬兩、其中印度政府售出二千四百萬兩（三五、○○○、○○○）新舊二項白銀、共計二億零七百二十萬兩、</p>
<p>估計一九三二年二億零七百二十萬兩銀之銷費中、計印度銷一千二百萬兩、中國（香港在内）四千萬兩、德國二千二百八十萬兩、</p>
<p>實業與裝飾品用銀、美國及欣那大約二千二百萬兩、英國約八百萬兩、墨西約一百萬兩、銀讀幣用去、計德國二千萬兩、墨西哥二千三百二十萬兩、古巴二百八十萬兩、尤古塞爾維亞五十萬兩、其餘一百二十萬兩存美國、其他五千三百七十萬兩、散在世界各處、</p>
<h3>低昂循環之厘拆市</h3>
<p>最近洋交因略稍冷落、市價殊少競爭之可能、卒至低昂雖時有見聞、而大勢循環盤旋、未有若何進展與退化、查往歲年關前後、厘價恒有變端、今屆以平時市面凋疲、結束又未能全部歸納、甚恐此後市面與往歲有互殊之形勢耳、</p>
<h3>厘拆平穏</h3>
<p>「洋厘」早市仍與前市相同爲七錢一分三厘六毫二忽半、午市續小二毫半、爲七錢一分三厘三毫七忽半、　　較前日早市共小六毫二忽半、「銀拆」早午市均開二分、劃頭加永亦祇二三分、銀根狀况、大體無甚　豁、</p>
<h3>輔幣互動</h3>
<p>江南小洋、早午兩市均爲六錢三分二厘、較前日改小三厘、交易早市七千角、午市三千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢二分零八毫七忽半、午市爲六錢二分一厘、交易早市九萬五千角、午市五萬角、銅元仍無上落、爲三百八十六千五百文、交易三萬八千六百餘　、</p>
<h3>銀洋進出</h3>
<p>「銀拆」昨日銀行收解因結束欵關係、似不甚簡、但需要究屬不多、故收解未見繁忙、華商收解票欵三百十餘萬、外商二百十餘萬、墊欵連日繼續不斷、昨日仍有二百餘萬、電匯欵八十四萬、押欵交易一百十餘萬、各種貨匯税雜諸欵收解九百二十餘萬、特欵三百餘萬、進倉五十萬、出倉九十萬、錢莊銀公單收解二千九百餘萬、押欵收解三百九十餘萬、各路匯欵收解九十餘萬、結束欵一百餘萬、收現三四十萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵、早市做出六十二萬、午市一百零七萬五千、鈔票早市五萬五千、午市三萬、塲外鈔票早市八萬、午市七萬五市、支單早市四萬、午市二萬、銀行買賣、早市互市五十五萬、午市一百萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百三十餘萬、鈔票進出二百十餘萬、洋押欵交易八十餘萬錢莊洋公單收解八百六十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百五十四萬、拆借洋欵進出一百四十餘萬、客路來源三十餘萬、去胃二十萬、小錢莊交易七十餘萬、</p>
<h3>證劵公債續漲一元左右</h3>
<p>昨（十一日）華商證劵交易所各債現貨雖有多種開出、惟成交極稀、全日祇做開一萬二千二百元、期貨則以市價平穏、人心亦轉沉靜、成交遂遠遜前日、計上下午七百七十八萬、内除鹽税一百八十五萬、統税一百四十六萬、餘均僅在七八十萬元左右、關税·九六·整六·極淸、蓋年節將屆、如環象沉靜、一般大户暫時不致有鉅額進出、昨晨初卽一致躍漲七八角、以後雖盤旋向堅、但上落始終甚微、結果比前日均續漲一元左右、僅九六·整六微跌、關税編遣等僅好數角云、</p>
<h3>紐約股市突漲</h3>

<h3>紗花標紗花重入疲途</h3>
<p>紗市又轉軟化、升降殊難捉摸、進退在一二兩之間、實以在總結賬之際、人心渙散、東北風雲險惡、市盤稍高、賣方就起、而存底太厚、紗布棧房中、屯積日見增加、此貨大半在金融家手中作套利息交易云、</p>
<h3>人標廠商套賣</h3>

<h3>鄭標小挫錢半</h3>

<h3>糧食白粳又提二三角</h3>
<p>南市籌建米倉庫···可儲十一萬包</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源稍夥、共有六十餘號、零胃轉活、行情略升角許、惟包胃平淡、高貨未貶、中次稍軟、　洋秈到貨仍稀、銷塲見活、市况轉鮮、陰元形俏、常帮到寥、高貨價亦砌高、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日各帮到船二十五六號、白粳囤户暫停、店胃零星尙活、致價又提二三角、薄稻早稻到貨續有、零銷稍動、價加尺外、杜埠尖到少銷　　　　　二三角、洋　　　　　尺、　　元零拆亦　、　　三四角、</p>
<p>又南市自米　跌連設後、市　大非昔比、惟有碼頭間無倉庫、剩米無暫　之所、殊感不便、刻以該處附近有地産九畝餘出售、即出豆米業公會買進、其臨浦滋建碼頭兩所、男則建新式米倉一所、三層、　骨水泥、由久記營　廠張效良君設計承造、可備米十一萬包、男地價請銀二十四萬兩、除發行建築公債十萬兩外、餘則籌借、大約十年之後、可以　淸云、</p>
<h3>期粉愈近愈俏</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、又呈堅俏之象、以洋麥報價回漲四五六七八角左右、故開盤後、均見　貴、較前日收盤、大致漲一二分不等、惟至二盤後、因阜豐逐步回出、勢甚迫切、所以遠期略見軟弱、迨至下午開盤、本月份市氣又復大振、因傳福新現貨早已開盡、目下尙有本月份之標準、急於抵補、所以市氣異常激昂、最高曾至一兩九錢九分半、惟阜豐對於三月份以下各期、仍然暢出、致人心堅中帶軟、不過現粉如是俏利、業内外人心、終有堅定耳、結果本月份漲二分、二三月份漲一分半、四月份漲七厘半、五月份漲二厘半、六月份漲一分云、</p>
<h3>現麥稀少期貨暴騰</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市呈暴騰之象、以洋麥報價、疾漲四五六七八角不等、業内外人心自然震動、本月份因現麥稀少、所到洋麥、廠方均亟於出粉、因次苟先軋空、上午開價卽至三兩七錢二分、後小二分、二月份以下、因有一部分行家、鑒於現麥之奇俏、深恐將來亦呈同樣情形、故抵補亟切、查此種情形、爲洋麥暢定中、實屬罕聞也、（澳麥定價目下仍在三兩七錢一　）結果本月份較前日漲四分、二月份漲八分、三四月份漲七分、餘無做　云、</p>
<h3>芝加哥小麥抵空飛漲</h3>

<h3>廢曆年關將屆客元及時旺銷</h3>
<p>昨日客秈客化略淡、但市上存到兩少、布面仍堅、且南帮胃口尙淡、北帮新近亦復注意、昨雖乏大帮動化、但以供求兩平之際、預料有南北兩大銷區之繼續辦裝、人心極佳、貨主與囤户均有扳價喊高之表示、後由北帮辦去湘機油二百五十包、南路泉州辦去湘機紅一百十包、機紅價開九元○二分、較大二分、機油價九元一角八分至九元○八分、較大四五分、週日客元到頭不多、存底亦微、因上月下旬價漲而旺到二批、市價又疲、來貨卽少、近日因各路採辦年底貨、河下到源盡被本街搜光、河下大市變元昨日漲至十一元左右、一部份本街乃改辦客元、客元本有北帮辦裝、隨至互相爭辦、價大近角、後胃尙濃、而存到兩少、預料後市有步漲之必要、全市開出湖南機元二百包、價已漲至十元、江西機元七十九包、</p>
<p>、價爲九元半云、</p>
<h3>黃荳跌勢已定</h3>
<p>黃豆市轉趨平定、本埠走勢、源源不斷、貨户乃有　　　售者、往後客化部能轉暢、尙有重升之望　、昨日成交大連黃豆一車、正陽　豆一車、　淮　豆二車、五河豆一車、係由本埠行家配於内地車坊去路、本街採辦東溝杜靑一百包、又浦東杜　廣帮辦去二百五十包、本街成交一百包、牛莊紅　内地帮辦進亦不少云、洽市平穏、仍無變化、昨行家　進花生一千五百　、豆油六百件</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白荷赤各小五分</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以　金　跌、而實銷轉靜、趨勢略呆、公會划盤二四粗砂白初叫十五兩九錢半、進户甚淡、皆乏吃胃、後以十五兩九錢成盤、稍有成交、比前日小五分、八九號荷赤亦小五分、划十二兩六錢、　靑昨續開三四百包、價與前相仿、惟形勢略呆、蓋現下總結賬期日迫、走塲有逐趨稀少之象、苟號貨不亟求售、市價可冀暫定也、</p>
<p>又據路透社十日紐約電、現貨爲七角八分一二五、期貨一月份不更、三·七·十二月各小三磅音、五·九月各小二磅音、</p>
<p>倫敦　市期貨三·五·八月各小二五、爪哇白粳市無更動、</p>
<h3>五金美會司鐡昨有現貨來電</h3>
<p>美會司鐡、海外廠方出貨久告缺少、故本埠要做定貨之同業雖四出問津、但洋行復電終以廠方無貨之詞爲對、昨日美商愼昌華大美康等洋行均接紐約廠方來電、謂有現貨四百餘噸、每箱（二百磅）要美金五元七角、（合申市二十五兩出零外費在内）、所以本埠同業均以其價太昂、頗難合算、所以均還價在五元四五角、但能否成交、須等明日洋行到電爲定、聞裝船期限則在二三月份云、</p>

<h3>黑暗桃源</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>使人神往的世外桃源山西模範省，在民國締造以來十餘年的過程中，得到四方觀風者衆口一詞的好譽；最近六七年間，這好譽成了烏有化了！尤其使人絶望的，便是讀了本報所載的一封報告晉省烟禁的太原通信！不料世外桃源步會得黑暗到這般田地。</p>
<p>通信中説變爲　　的山西，近來毒品充斥；中路各縣，白　丨卽海洛茵銷售數景，年達三十餘萬兩，每兩値銀六七十元。南路一帶，紅丸丨卽金丹到處暢銷。就這幾句報告，已足見桃花源　人家都被慘雲毒　層層疊疊的罩住了，何况晉省的黑暗情形，還不止此？</p>
<p>陶淵明的傑作！桃花源記，是從小光明中得到大光明。記中説的「　　若有光，」這呌做小光明。「復行數十步，豁然開朗，」這呌做大光明。論到號稱世外桃源的晉省，是從小光明中得到大黑暗。民國締造以來各省屢起戰爭，只有這世外桃源比較承平一些，這呌做小光明。直到現在，毒品充斥了桃花源；這不好説「復行數十步，豁然開朗，」只配説復經二十年，错然黑暗。　　桃花源中的民衆幸福，只看陶老先生記的！「黃髮垂髫，並怡然自樂，」這眞是一種「烏託邦的快活景象。現在的世外桃源，也可稱得烏託邦，不過要作别解，當做烏烟寄託　邦看待了！至於「黃髮垂髫，並怡然自樂，」這兩句不通用了，適用的是金丹白麵，並公然暢銷。</p>
<p>世外桃源一變而爲反桃源，再變而爲黑暗桃源，這是誰的過失？</p>
<h3>寓褒貶</h3>
<p>— 徐絜</p>
<p>老二的老把戲！</p>
<p>在周代的季年，諸侯䟦扈，天下大亂已顯明的時候·那曲阜的孔老先生，簡直没有辦法。在魯國雖然做了四個月宰相，畢竟不能夠發展抱負；不得已，周遊列國，想遇着同志，來作爲作爲。恰巧這時候，各國都想稱覇稱雄，滿肚皮都是刀槍劍戟，刁鑽古怪，誰來聽你仁義迂道。孔老先生没法，只得没精打采地回到家鄉，拿起肇來，做了一部「春秋。」原來春秋筆法，非常謹嚴，是寓了褒貶當世人物做宗旨，去寒亂臣賊子之膽。雖然他老先生的得意門生，像子游，　子夏，也不能贊一個字，可見孔老先生的愼重了。可是孔老先生雖然做了這部大文章，到了戰國，天下益發混亂起來，弄得不可收拾，雖然出了一位孟軻，勸人家不要看重這個「利」字，也一些兒没有效用。結果，大家厮殺了一回，過了二百多年，到了漢朝，方纔太平。那孔老先生的「春秋」巨著，在當時固然没有人睬他，到如今，究竟誰敢説是没有價値呢？目下的中國，委像春秋閉幕，戰國開幕的時候，林語堂先生急忙忙來做部「論語，」周瘦鵑先生也來趕做部「春秋，」都想來玩玩孔老二的老把戲，其志可嘉，其實一些兒没有功效！不是在下瞎説，還不是大家來玩一回孫　的兵書，黃石公的六韜，否則還是做幾部鬼谷子，道德經，南華經的好，不曉得兩位先生，以爲怎樣？</p>
<h3>都會的透視</h3>
<p>— 龍騷</p>
<p>丨兩階級的生活線丨</p>
<p>巨人一樣的起重機高高地弔在半空中，銜着鐡桿和木石，深打入地層下，樹起雄偉的精緻的大厦或往宅。你走過大西路，西愛咸斯路，馬斯南路，博物院路以及南京路，北四川路等等，會瞧到這些以幾千萬黃金換得來的建築物。在那裏，有熱的水汀，趕走了嚴冬的寒冷，有高級的電梯，代人走路，有佈置雅潔的花園，有肥壯的北歐種的大狗，有驕傲的傭僕，有香粉的氣息···</p>
<p>一九三四年式的汽車停在門側，俄羅斯大漢把持着手槍立在主人或主婦的旁邊</p>
<p>，少爺和小姐圍坐火爐邊談論着電影明星之類的故事。上海，這富人們的上海，像春花一樣美麗，黃金一樣光亮，也像葡萄酒一樣的芳甜！</p>
<p>一個紳士連同他的家屬，錬條一樣的傭僕和狗之類；便佔據了龐大的華厦在那裏亨樂着。</p>
<p>然而我們回頭來瞧一瞧火柴匣子一樣的城廂裏的居民。一幢一下東洋房子裏要羣聚着五六個家庭，連扶梯的中段會臨空駕着上海人通稱的所謂「夾層樓。」在那裏，馬桶與行　放在一起，翁姑和子媳會同睡在一個房裏，子女放學之後要在油燈下温習舊書，但四周的麻雀聲和噪嘴打駡聲會攪亂你的寗靜，於是每一個工人爲了失眠而减少明天在碼頭上工作的工錢，每一個小學生爲没有好環境而往往不能跟着學齡完成他們僅有的敎育！！更不必再談起馬路的人，行道上又是睡了多少的勞働者們！上海，這窮人們的上海，像汚泥一樣黑暗，刀鋒一樣寒冷，也像掰斯淋一樣的臭惡！</p>

<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>現在是金錢的時代，所以窮人在這世界上難以揷足，而富人却有統治這世界的威權！</p>
<p>有人説：「都市　富人的天堂，是窮人的地獄。」我説：「都市是糊塗人的天堂，是明白人的地獄。」</p>
<p>走路的窮人們希望馬路上没有汽車，坐汽車的富人們希望馬路上没有行人，原因是窮人想在馬路上走慢步，富人想在馬路上開快車。</p>
<p>有錢的依賴金錢，甚麽事情都可以幹，所以我説「富人是一種機械。」無錢的兩手空空，甚麽事情都不能幹，所以我説「窮人是一具僵尸。」</p>
<p>窮人由勤儉而富，富人由奢惰而窮，窮變富，富變窮，這是一種窮富的循環</p>

<h3>了·紅·</h3>
<p>— 瘦·鵑</p>
<p>這時，太陽已到了休息時間，半身已躱進地平線，僅剩了舌尖微露於唇外似的一點。天空中一隊隊的烏鴉，正自一陣陣地聒噪，好像欣然自傲，告訴人類説：「我們將要回到快樂而安適的家中了。」歐陽生自送這些活動約黑點，不禁微喟一聲，於是他的思緖，又循序漸進。</p>
<p>第二幕的開始：他好容易衝破一天嚴厲的寒威，超過似乎比太平洋更遼闊的曠野，一路歪斜顚撲，捨命向前，他好幾次疑惑在這世界上，已没有個此刻所需要的目的地。他全身的每一個汗毛孔中，都呈了緊張。他在這情形底下，終於到了他的目的地丨好友東方生的家門外，丨只是，可憐丨當時他的情狀，實已比在槍林彈雨腥風血霧中苦戰了十晝夜的兵士，更爲　觫狼狽。風的威嚴，甚於大砲；雪的殘狠，甚於快槍，大槪再　若干時間的冷與恐怖，他也許只能和死神握手，而不能到達他摰友的門前。</p>
<p>時候已近午夜，祇有風雪掌了一切的權威。他傴僂着死屍一般冷的軀體，蹲在東方生的階前，遍體帶着積雪，遠望幾成了一隻縮頸而眠的大白鷺。全身的骨節，一陣陣戰慄，就像一輛敝舊而正狂駛的車子，已不許有再顫抖一會的可能。上下的牙齒，也起了劇烈的鬥爭，連續做那自殘的工作。可是他仍伸長了頸，在西北風中，捨命發爲嘶聲的呼籲。他自以爲他的呼聲，高到無可再高，偏是可惡的西北風，比他的呼喊更高。并且每一張口，便有一大塊風，挾了好幾朶雪，打到他口邊。這樣，又經過了若干時間，天可憐見，在慈悲的風聲稍息之時：他居然把那可憐的聲音，送到了裏面。又居然把東方生夫婦倆的靈魂，從甜蜜的夢境中喚回。比及他聽見了門内的人聲，直似接到上帝親賜的福音，門兒一開，他那裏等得及舉足跨越門限，上半身只一撲，便猛然直跌進門夫去。（三）</p>

<h3>古城碎語</h3>
<p>— 彭若谷</p>
<p>華盛頓伊爾文，曾以Creensburgh名之日逗留鎭TarryTown，我説蘇州，正配這個名字的形容。</p>
<p>在地理學上，有三個水鄉，是意大利的威尼斯，　羅的盤谷，同我們的蘇州；可是那總不是我們蘇州的匹敵，我們蘇州有最最雄偉的三萬六千頃七十二峯浸沈着的太湖！碌碌餘子，那可不必説了。</p>
<p>俗語説：「上有天堂，下有蘇杭。」想吧，以艶色名天下的西子湖，還是遜於蘇州，這可不是蘇州名勝的證信嗎？西締説：「黃昏時候的　前街，是最最可以感到東方威尼斯的美妙。」我説還不如在七里山塘一帶。</p>
<p>自從詩人張繼的「夜泊」一詩輸入了日本以後，於是日本的學者，商人，同軍專家，便一批一批的跑到蘇州來觀光，寫景，看天平紅葉，訪寒山古寺。一顚一顚騎在驢子背上，暗地　計畫他們秘密的工作。若以我们研究立藝的偏見説起來，那末詩人張繼便逃不了極大的責任，是猶之乎目下帝國主義的侵略，我們要歸罪於「東方見聞錄」的作者馬哥博羅。</p>
<p>「夜半鐘聲到客船」的那個鐘，現在是永遠聽不見了！老早被那狼心的蝦夷人盜買去了。康有爲有「鐘聲已渡海雲東，冷盡寒山古寺楓·」的詩句刻在楓橋。啊！你聽，你聽呀！現在不是在遙遠的三島上嗚嗚的悲鳴嗎，這是我們蘇州古先烈幽靈的呼喚！</p>
<p>近代戲劇作家田漢氏，在他「蘇州夜話」的一劇裏，有歌唱着：</p>
<p>去呀，去呀！</p>
<p>到夜的街上去！</p>
<p>到夜的蘇州去！</p>
<p>夜的蘇州，是多麽有趣！</p>
<p>你可以看見羅馬似的城頭的月，</p>
<p>你可以看見威尼斯似的街頭的水，</p>
<p>你可以看見弓陀拉似的船，</p>
<p>你可以看見船上詰婆西似的女，</p>
<p>這是暴露古城美妙的歌詠。</p>
<p>明末魏忠賢的爪牙毛一鷺，到蘇州來做官，百姓起來驅逐他，後來魏逆要殺盡蘇人，義士顔佩韋等五人，就慷慨激昂的認了那次起義的主動人物。後來終於被殺了！像這們絶大的一個悲劇，在民氣柔弱的蘇州城裏，可説得是僅有的了。但是現在五位義士的墳墓，竟荒廢得使人莫可認識了！我希望地方上的紳士，同古物保管會的委員，應當負責修築的。</p>
<p>近代戲劇家田漢氏，有「血與雪」的一劇。</p>
<p>就是描寫蘇州明末五人就義的故事，價値可與「一致」相等。</p>
<p>女人，又是蘇州的特産之一。可是終歸是罪惡的東西！幾千年前，我們蘇州就是滅亡在西施手裏。現在靈巖山上的琴台，響　廊，西施洞。都是伊罪惡的遺跡！</p>
<p>據我所知，蘇州有二個墳墓的題名，値得我們喜歡文藝者所欣賞的，一個在靈巖山的山脚下，是詩人張永夫的，石上面題着「再來人之墓。」一個是大休和尙，現在生前自已經營的生穴，在小黃山（？）碑上題着「大休休息處。」　　蘇州旣稱爲住宅區域，最可惜的缺點：就是没有自來水，家家户户，至今還在喝井水和河水。井水總帶些鹹味，河水常有死狗死貓掉在裏面，兼之天天加以排洩物，喝下肚去，實在太不衛生。這是蘇州人所不可不設法改善的。</p>

<h3>詼諧家柴霍甫的出葬</h3>
<p>— 石徑斜</p>
<p>誰都知道，柴霍甫是個比較的短命的文學家，在一九零四年七月二日，他因肺癆而病倒而辭世於德國，遺骸便馬上從德國運到莫斯科。當遺骸到莫斯科那天，莫斯科車站差不多被迎靈的人們占得無立錐的餘地。不久，火車到了，一具棺從一輛綠色的貨車裏運下來，一隊軍隊很巷敬地對那具棺行禮，迎柴氏的靈櫬的人們雖然覺得很奇怪，但祇好跟着那具棺的後面跑；後來才知道錯了，那是日俄戰爭中在滿洲戰死的鎧爾列爾將軍的遺骸，而詼諧家柴霍甫的棺，却是從另一輛貨車裏運下來的一具。那輛貨車的車身，很明白地寫着；「運猪的車子」！這事情不是和柴氏故意開玩笑嗎？</p>
<p>對於那天的葬儀，高爾基在他的日記裏曾這樣地寫着：</p>
<p>「跟着柴霍甫的棺後送葬的人，至多也不過一百人，總不會較多。那時候，送葬人中有兩個律師最會使我想出。他們兩個人都穿着新的鞋子，結着絞結的領帶，顯然都是「定婚者」。我跟着這兩個送葬者的後面跑，聽着他們裏面那個呌做馬克控考夫的一個在論着狗的精明和愚鈍：另外一個我不熟悉的，則吹着他鄉下的别墅是怎樣的舒服，周圍的景致是怎樣的秀麗。還有一個穿着藤色的衣服而拿了一根飾着綠花邊的洋傘的婦人，對着一個戴大眼鏡的老紳士喋喋地説着故人柴氏的德行；「你知道嗎，那是一個很愛嬌的人啊，他所説的話没有一句不是詼諧好笑的啊！」那個老頭子，好像不同意地，祇咯咯地咯嗽着。那天，天氣很熱，灰塵在飛揚着。葬儀的前面，有一個魁梧的巡查騎着一匹肥胖的白馬，竟氣揚揚地引導着。」</p>
<p>最後，高爾基還用了一種激烈的嘲駡，結束了對於這個偉大作家葬儀當時的追憶；</p>
<p>「一切的一切，都過於非常的平凡而卑俗，對於那麽偉大而巧妙的作家之回想上，實在未免太甚了！」</p>
<p>這就是詼諧家柴霍甫的出葬；假使柴氏有靈，不知道他將要在棺内用一種怎様詼諧嚴酷的口調來回答這社會的捉弄呵！</p>
<h3>將軍們的苦心</h3>
<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>隨着榆關失守的消息，我們在報上又看到了許多激昂慷慨的通電與演説。張學良的演説是：會「以血與肉維護正義，還我國土，一切可了。」向主不抵抗的張學良，現在也决心抵抗了。再如閻錫山·韓復榘·宋哲元·徐源泉·何成𤀹蔡廷錯等將領，都無不紛紛請纓，願爲抗日前驅。甚至忙於内戰的劉湘；也通電聲明「結束軍事，枕戈待命。」</p>
<p>自九一八事件發生以後直至今日，在敵人的砲火與屠殺中所維持着的「親善」與「和平」的局面，這樣是不免於破裂了，山海關的戰事，到底成爲了中日戰爭的導火線，我想。然而自榆關失守，一星期多的日子過去了，石河前線平靜無事，報上老是傳着調停的消息，事情却不像戰事便會爆發。我們的對日政策，似乎依舊是鎭靜，忍耐，不抵抗。</p>
<p>何柱國將軍説：「不戰，不和，不守，不走，苦心後人自知」。但除何將軍的苦心以外，我更知道其他各將軍，也是各有其苦心。因爲「兵凶戰危」，尤其是對於强國日本的抗戰，畢竟不是兒戲，這是要用自已的生命與地盤來相拚的。你看：馬占山抵抗於龍江，失敗了。蔡廷錯抵抗於淞滬，撤兵了。蘇炳文抵抗於滿洲里，退入俄國了。這一次，何柱國在山海關，轟轟烈烈的戰鬥的結果，又是雄關天險·化爲灰燼，退守石河。抵抗有些什麽利益呢？反之，「上海停戰協定」之後，上海却依然不失爲「娱樂救國」的上海。抵抗，何苦來？</p>
<p>所以，隨着山海關事件展開的，决不是血與火的熱辣辣的戰爭，這，請「愛好和平」的古國的人們放心！而且，山海關的抗戰，也許就是最後的抵抗，不久·山海關停戰「照例」的「協定」而後，「東亞和平」之基礎當依然是安穏如泰山。</p>
<h3>紅豆</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>現代詩人劉大白，他和紅豆有一叚因緣。</p>
<p>這小小的殷紅而微紫的小豆，象微燃燒在他的心頭的炎火。</p>
<p>民國十三年元旦，他從江陰周剛直那裏得到一雙紅豆，爲它寫了三首雙紅豆：</p>
<p>「歲朝初，」一封書，珍重緘將兩粒珠，嘉名紅豆呼。　樹全枯，卻重蘇，生怕相思種子無，天敎留半株。</p>
<p>望江南，樹彫殘，莫作尋常老樹看，相思憑此傳。　體微圓，色微殷，星影霞光耀　天，離離紅可憐。</p>
<p>豆一雙，人一雙，紅豆雙雙貯錦囊，故人天一方。　似心房，當心房，倀着心房密密藏，莫敎離恨長。」</p>
<p>他愛好這情韻縣　趣味深長的俊物，置之懷袖間，把玩不捨。去年春間，劉大白先生作古，道雙紅豆，便不知淪落何處了。他死後第三天，有一紅衣女郎來摭棺働哭，衆皆不相識。問她來由，她自明爲劉大白先生的「甜心」，説出雙雙愛好的因緣；後來她取出紅豆爲證。這雙紅豆，總算有所依歸了。</p>
<p>大白先生要周剛直替他找江陰縣志的紅豆掌故，周剛直不久也因反動嫌疑在江陰梟　，没有下文。大白先生自已找了萬紅友汪碧菓的詩詞，屈大均的木語，鈕銹的粤觚，周亮工的書影等等掌故，以我所知，干　搜神記就有記載：</p>
<p>「大夫韓馮妻美，宋康王奪之。馮自殺，妻投台下死。王怒，令　相望。宿昔，有文梓不生二　之端，根　於下，枝錯其上，宋王哀之，因號其木日想思樹。」</p>

<h3>新六分儀</h3>
<p>— 夏璆</p>
<p>六分儀是一種航海或測量内常用的儀器，用他測太陽的亮度角後卽可决定船行的方位。以前用的六分儀必須太陽照耀，始能測其角度，一且有霧或雲將太陽蓋上，六分儀根本上就失了牠的效用。現在的新六分儀就不然了，卽使是大霧，牠還是能測太陽的高度。牠的原理是如下：我們知道太陽上是有紅外線（inlra-redRayss）的，這種線可以穿過任何種雲或霧，不過平常的肉眼不能看見，只有用光電管（Photo-Eltclric　Cell）可以收取而使牠在鏡頭上顯現。現在的新六分儀上是裝以一種特製的光電管，太陽上的紅外線可以直接射到牠的望遠鏡上，所以不論太陽是隠或現都能使用了。</p>
<h3>日本結婚奇俗</h3>
<p>— 陳湜</p>
<p>結婚這個名詞·在日本古時，稱爲Mitonomakhay,或Kunag，或Yoby，（譯音）是單指男女交合，或男子到女家去幽會的一種意思。這種用語，在日本的風俗習慣上，有很遠的來歷，許多關於結婚的奇風異俗，也都可由這幾個字上推想出來。現在，日本這種奇俗的遺留，已不很多，所以流行迄今的一般用語，也將漸漸爲人所不解，成爲奥妙與古僻的字面了。這大抵因爲日本當局的禁止，或自然的廢除吧！但一定説　們的遺風都已絶跡，那也不盡然的，這裏，我們來談談那些遺風吧！</p>
<p>淡路島某部落，在結婚的前夕，由新郎最親信的友人，先伴新娘睡。這大概是所謂「處女的迴避」或「初夜權」的遺風。正和豐復國日出郡夜明村，八月十六日夜裏，村長對全村的妙齡女郎，施行其「初夜權」的故事有同樣的出處。在東北北海道方面，也流行着一種和這類似的習俗。</p>
<p>大琉球石垣島地方，還有一種用經水手帕作訂婚禮物的習俗。記得成斯往馬克博士寫的，RituralandPelieinMorocco.Voli."裏，也曾記述摩洛哥男女訂婚的一種奇俗，恰與日本經水手帕的風習吻合。他説摩洛哥的女子，到了花信年華，對於這種迷信，便堅信不疑。她們相信心念戀人時，只要把自已的×毛和腋毛，剪下少許，用火焚燒，或將經水染過的手帕，用火焚燒，再口唸一種特定的咒語，則立刻見效，戀人必定會來和她幽會的。這一點，便可證明東西洋的風俗，實有很多可以灌通的地方。琉球石垣島的少女，則以自已經水染過的手帕，贈送男友，用作一種訂盟的信物。</p>
<p>還有日本伊豆大島地方的結婚風俗，當新娘在婚禮最熱鬧的時候，須從男家潛歸母家，而不可爲來賓及夫家一切人們知道。待第二天早晨，俟新郎親迎，始再一道回去行禮。新娘於婚禮最熱鬧的時候，若不能潛行逃回，便令全村所恥笑或輕蔑。這種新娘潛逃的習俗，很可證明它是掠奪婚時代被掠奪女子於搶去之後尙思逃歸的一種遺留觀念。</p>
<p>還有奄美大島的結婚風俗，是最先由男家派遣一個迎接新娘的使者到女家去。一切的把戲，便由這個使者串演出來了。他在新娘家裏，狂飲高歌，所歌的大都是些調情的話。喧鬧了一夜，第二天始迎接新娘子一起歸去舉行婚禮。</p>
<h3>或人的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>這世界，就如像被推進了漆様黑的地底。太陽没有了光，也没有了熱，從那年起。海在嘯，風在悲號，世界在黑暗中戰慄，眼前遍處都是火藥，遍處都是活地雷。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>擎起鞭子，世界已不聽從我的指揮，望着那堆積着的貨物，只有長暎氣。眞要命！那一羣餓不死的凍不死的，偏還要拚命地閙着：要工做·要飯吃。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>聽説莊嚴的白宫前曾有一羣餓不死的示威聽説華麗的倫敦也曾被一羣凍不死的包圍。</p>
<p>我們的刀，槍，棒，瓦斯彈，現在竟都没有了威力，</p>
<p>騷亂，暴動，討厭的呌喊，竟跑進了「我們的社會」！</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>仰問天：你到底抱着什麽主意？</p>
<p>伸長手，往日的緊榮竟招不回。</p>
<p>變了，什麽都變了，就從那年起，</p>
<p>天，我只能跑在你的足前戰慄！</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路（續稿）</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>鶴子夫人也不承認海泉是一個了不起的美男子。不過她對於他的强烈的男性和脱落不嚴的態度發生了興趣。</p>
<p>她放輕脚步，走到他的床邊來了。</p>
<p>「林先生；」</p>
<p>她聲音低小地微笑着喚了一聲。當然没有反應。她眞想把他呌醒來和她作終宵的暢談，因爲好幾天没有和他相聚了，更覺對於他有些戀戀。但只一刻，翻想一下，又没有了勇氣。她只站在他的床邊痴想，忽然聞着一陣酒臭。她看見海泉在被窩裏打了一個呵欠，一翻身，他的臉朝着外面來了。她以爲他醒來了，胸口跳躍了一下。但是海泉仍然不知道有個闖入者立在他的床邊，又熟睡下去了。</p>
<p>「不錯。他今晚上是到任家去喝了酒回來的。」</p>
<p>她想着無意中望了望他的書桌面。她看見有一封，封面上印有「財政部」等紅字的特别大的信簡。於是她又放輕脚步走到桌邊來。她看淸楚了封面的墨筆字是，「煩交柳局長勛啟」七個字，在紅的部字的上面也加着「任託」兩個黑字。</p>
<p>她看見他的桌面上還攤開着一本類似雜誌的書本，打開着的那頁上面有「文化的轉變」五個字的標題映進她的網膜上來了。她翻起那本雜誌的封面來一看，是「現代文化」四個大赤字。側面署「華民題」三個小字也是赤色的。在封面下端的左隅，還有鋼筆寫的「海泉兄指正現代文化社贈」幾個深藍色的草字。</p>

<h3>日敎育界的韻事</h3>
<p>— 白匋</p>
<p>訓育主任做妓女</p>
<p>敎授夫人駕車拉客</p>
<p>幾月前，我們在報紙上看到東瀛三島有位女敎員當妓女的事，最近京都帝大敎授夫人居然也能駕車拉客，這都是日本敎育界的韻事。女敎員當妓女的事，記者已不很淸楚，大槪那位女敎員是在某某尋常小學裏當訓育主任的。因爲敎育事業淸貧，領到的薪金不夠她化用，所以聰明的女敎員便想出特别的生財辦法來：白盡規規矩矩進學堂當訓育主任，夜晚則擦脂抺粉進咖啡座拉客，而且居然能門庭如市，利市三倍，舉止闊綽起來。後來，這位不幸的女敎員被軍警拘捕，而且被學校當局革職了。據日本人自家説，因爲她犯了褻凟神聖敎育事業的大罪。</p>
<p>最近那位駕車拉客的敎授夫人，日本京都的電信上這樣説着：京都街頭祈園烏九通一帶，有高貴婦女，運轉野雞汽車，頻頻呼客，頗惹人注目，旋據調查各係京都帝大經濟學部助敎授姥川虎三氏夫人律子，三十二歲。律子夫人以夫君埋頭研究不事生産，乃秘密練習，取得車夫證書·日爲車夫，以謀利，夜爲主婦以理家，冀相夫俾成學業。這位律子夫人眞是難得，難得！蛯川虎三敎授，可帮得賢内助矣！</p>
<p>我看律子夫人很有犯「有礙風化」罪的嫌疑，也許日本軍警會姑念其志可嘉而大赦她罷！</p>
<p>咱們中國學生界也出過類乎這一樣的事。例如從前蘇州某某學校裏的學生，曾經拉過東洋車：最近南京京華中學的女學生王玉容女士在夫子廟當歌女，而不幸的王女士竟因充當歌女被校長先生開除了。這也可以算是敎育界的韻事吧。</p>

<h3>人造象牙</h3>
<p>— 履霜</p>
<p>人造象牙的用處很大，因其價廉物美，所以他的銷路已出超眞象牙數倍</p>
<p>人造象牙的製法甚多，出品各異，最普通者製自蟻酫Formalehyde和石炭酸Carbolicacid，名石炭酸膠Bakeliteo本篇所述的人造象牙，乃製自一種廢物，其價値較石炭酸膠更便宜。至石炭酸象牙之製法，容後再述。</p>
<p>牛奶經久後，表面即有物浮起，如水垢狀，此名乳酪。普通人只認爲牛奶之廢物，殊不知應用很廣的人造象牙，即以此爲原料。</p>
<p>用乳酪以製象牙的工業，發明於一千八百九十七年，經多次的改良，至一千九百年始有商品上市。其製品可代角類，玳瑂等的製品。用以代賽璐珞·其彈力雖不及後者之强，因其爲不燃性·又可用於製小孩玩具原料。又能隔電，電料中亦常用。其他製品有傘柄，自來水筆桿，刷板，梳子，鏡架等多種。茲將其製法，介紹於下。</p>
<p>先以酸類（如醋酸）將牛奶中之乳酪沈澱出，除去牛奶中其他成份。再將此乳酪加水及鹼類，熱至攝氏一百度，隨熱隨搗，至成厚膠狀液。此時即可將所需要之顔色加入。其後加入極淡之鹽酸，　入後，攪拌多時，即放入各種模型中壓成物形。惟此種製品，乾時即顯裂紋，故於十二小時後，將上述製出之品，放入蟻醛内，移時取出，則成品非但性質變硬，且乾時亦無裂紋，浸入水中不吸水，比粗製品精美多多。</p>

<p>— 吳天聲</p>
<p>一夢舟車已送秋。功名眞笑執鞭求。勤家餘汝憐炊米。破灶勞薪併煑愁。更課諸皃依紡織。又驚兵火幾奔投。歸來萬刼同雲散。携看團圓月滿樓。</p>

<p>冥冥萬里破愁飛。照影關河肅四圍。上訴精魂遙可接。下留泥瓜欲何依。横天自挾稜稜氣。列陣還餘凛凛威。塞外傳來　風信緊。衝寒羞愧稻梁肥。</p>
<h3>補秘的家庭</h3>
<p>— 翊烈</p>
<p>我們的二房東，可説是月影戲中時常做出來的的一樣，也是一個胖胖的三十幾光景的婦人，對你房客也是月影戲中表演出來似的，對有錢的房客是一副　慈祥的面孔·對及有錢的房客是一副猙獰的面孔。</p>
<p>雖則是徐娘半老，但風韻猶好，所以化妝起來，儼然是十足的摩登小婦。　　她們的家庭大槪的組織是這樣的：有一個年約七十歲的老太婆，一個五六歲的兒子。一個十二三歲的丫頭，用一個老媽子。</p>
<p>我實在不能確定那一個是她們家庭組織内男主人·據我知道的有個年約半百的男子及年約三十歲穿着畢挺西裝的男子，是時常來的。而且常常是在二房東那裏過夜的。但我總没有看到老少同時來過，所以，我從前猜他們是父子顯然是錯誤的。</p>
<p>依丫頭的稱呼，呌老的稱大老爺，少的稱老爺，這，當然不能做根據，而就説這是二房東的大丈夫，小丈夫的。　　我曾經想盡了種種方法，探聽二房東家庭組織的究竟，可是，費了很長的時間，得不到一點結果。</p>
<p>有一天下午二點鐘時，穿着畢挺西裝的男子來了，二房東説：</p>
<p>「你爲什麽今天要來？」</p>
<p>「好，不要經。」</p>
<p>於是就打電話。電話通了：</p>
<p>「噲！這那裏？」</p>
<p>「是××珠寳舖嗎？呌王老板聽電話。」</p>
<p>「是王××嗎？」</p>
<p>「你今天不要，我有點事體去，要到夜裏十二點鐘才能回來」。</p>
<p>掛上聽簡，回到房中關上門，又不知在做什麽了。</p>
<p>天下的事没有這樣凑巧了。</p>
<p>又是一天下午五點鐘時，穿畢挺西裝的男子又來了，但我們的二房東已出去了。</p>
<p>過二十分鐘光景，二房東同五十來歲的男子坐着汽車回來了，從汽車拿出好許多東西。</p>
<p>没有比現在再要使她躊躇不安事了，我眞不能形容出來。然而，我們的二房東始終是個聰明的婦人，即刻將躊躇不安變爲驚喜的態度，并且呌一聲：</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「表弟，你幾時來的？」</p>
<p>「這是我的表弟，」旋轉頭説：「這是你的表姊夫。」</p>
<p>我爲好奇心的趨使，費盡了九年二虎之力，終算得到這様一點頭路。</p>
<h3>權威的孩子</h3>
<p>— 米率</p>
<p>约摸十四五歲了，那××齋傳達處的小孩，他操着似是而非的四川口音，有時又會打起上海白來，他雖没有什麽程度，但是他認得姑娘們的芳名，并且很活潑的跳來跳去，有什麽事，那他很敏捷的代人做，在大家的眼光裏，確是個乖巧的孩子。</p>
<p>會客室裏的來賓，差不多天天客滿，後至者祇得徬徨幕外，鵠候補缺，尤其在星期六的下午，那麽談笑的聲響，簡直和茶館裏没有兩樣，所不像的，祇見圍繞着坐着，桌上放着糖果喲，瓜子喲，可没有茶壼茶碗而已。</p>
<p>照會客室裏的規則，除星期六以外，每晚至七時爲止，星期六特别優待可以到九時，雖是延長了兩小時，但是男同學們好像依舊戀戀不捨似的坐在那裏，那墻上掛着的規則，在他們心目中或者已和具文一般。</p>
<p>乖巧的孩子，一跳跳的跑來了，手摸着電燈開關，好似又不忍心使得他和她們就此分别，可是時間已經截止，不然，似乎不盡職，終於「叭」的一響，隨聲説着「熜燈了」！</p>
<p>大家的談話，也就突然中止，毫無疑意的分散了，</p>
<p>乖巧的孩子，竟操着偌大的權威！</p>
<p>實在是個「權威的孩子」。</p>

<h3>瘋了？　沉舟</h3>
<p>時鐘噹噹地敲了四下，王師母曉得這是學堂放學的時候了，忙放下手中針線，跑到灶間，招呼阿金生煤爐，自已高捲起袖子管，洗菜，切年糕，預備好點心，等待她十六歲兒子琅回家來吃，</p>
<p>「媽」，果然她的兒子琅回來了！可是呌媽的聲音，似乎没有往日的那般快活，淸脆，只是沈重而遲鈍地，琅把書包放下，坐在桌子旁的坐椅上，臉色鐡板板的，一聲不響。</p>
<p>「琅！餓嗎？」媽問，</p>
<p>「··················」</p>
<p>「怎麽不作聲？肚子餓嗎？······你」</p>
<p>和同學鬭了嘴嗎？」媽猜。</p>
<p>「不是。媽。」</p>
<p>「那末爲甚麽不快樂呢？你人有些難過嗎？」</p>
<p>「没有，媽！我要當兵去！」</p>
<p>「什麽？」</p>
<p>「我要當兵去！日木人太可惡了！把我們山海關也佔了去！又殺死了無數的我們忠勇的義勇軍，和無辜的同胞！</p>
<p>可恨那班没有心肺的同胞，他們眞大買賣日貨，否則怎麽日貨的進口額會不停地在激增？唉！長沙六一慘案，五卅，濟南，··········九一八，·········一二八，慘案太多了！他們生出來就在慘案下過活！司空見慣，是的，不能怨他們！但是，這是誰的過愆？媽！我不能像他們那般麻木不仁，至少我要表示我是大中華民國的國民一份子，當兵去！打！打退日本倭奴！」琅激昂地大聲説。</p>
<p>「靜些！琅，你的先生今天不知道又和你們説些什麽了，使你發瘋！」媽卻埋怨先生。</p>
<p>「不，我並不瘋！我要當兵去！先生的話一些也不差！媽，你看！世界上除了中國，那一國不在進步：歐戰後的土耳其！忘國的印度！和一切向帝國主義者挑　的小國！堂堂的大中華民國，在這危急存亡，千鈞一髮之秋，還不自救，抵抗！倘若説：這是在學印度，那末爲甚麽日本不來怕你？况且，睜開眼睛看看，中國是不是早已忘了國，你要鎭靜，待到忘國後你再鎭靜不遲！那時，你不鎭靜，你的主人會呌你鎭靜！但是，現在國還没有忘啊！媽，我不願偷安，我·········我要當兵去！」琅發狂也似的飛奔下樓去。</p>
<p>「阿金！快將少爺攔住！不要給他跑啊！」王師母一壁喊一壁跑下樓來。　　「我要去當兵啊！」琅哭了，王師母和阿金把他抬到王師母的臥室裏去。</p>
<h3>自修室裏的爭辯</h3>
<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>這是年假後第一天，上課鐘還没敲，自修室裏還只有我和ＳＬ三人，所以空氣是很靜寂，十分鐘後Ｍ進來啦，一脚剛踏進門；嘴裏早在喊着「讀什麽書呢！快做週年啦」？</p>
<p>「什麽呌做週年」？Ｌ第一個抬起頭説。</p>
<p>「榆關失守！······你看上海也快做週年啦」·Ｍ很起勁的説：同時又好似要證實這話所以又説：「閘北不是又有人家在搬動嗎」？</p>
<p>「好啦，别週年不週年，你的意思我曉得：你以爲自已有錢，橫堅萬一有事變朝租界上一跑：幹你的跳舞塲生活，對嗎」我們的愛國志士Ｓ説。</p>
<p>「自然囉！」Ｍ扳着鬼臉説，但，又接着説：「再不及時行樂，難道等亡了國再行樂嗎」？</p>
<p>「你這冷透了血的××」！Ｓ很氣憤的説。</p>
<p>「别説吧！我看了現在的情形·要没有二個鼻孔早氣死啦？起初賊來不抵抗，等到已進門又想來客堂裏時，於是所謂抵抗了。但，可憐的武器底相差終於榆關失守了，更滑稽的客堂背後的自已人還在自相殘殺！國聯與我們的帮助已很淸楚啦，但，我們還有人在相信他，這樣下去還不是乾脆的亡了國吧」？</p>
<p>Ｍ一篇大道理的説。</p>
<p>「我看你亡國二字不離口，等到國眞亡了你還有現在這樣的快樂自由嗎？······東北義軍爲着不願做亡國奴而抵抗，也爲着看不過亡國的慘像，照你這樣多錢化，雖然不要你毁家紓難，也應當多捐助一點錢給義軍，上次捐助義軍時；看你出了四角小洋還肉麻呢？···」Ｓ想起了上次捐欵時Ｍ吝嗇的形狀愈説愈氣。</p>
<p>「那麽你旣然這樣愛國爲什麽不上東北去參戰呢」？Ｓ説。</p>
<p>「我雖不上東北去，但也不會在國難期間進跳舞塲」Ｍ説，同時用手羞着Ｍ，這顯然似乎是挑戰的表示。</p>
<p>「像你這窮鬼也没資格進跳舞塲呢」！Ｍ披着嘴説。</p>
<p>Ｓ這時氣極了預備自由行動了，Ｍ也握着拳預備抵抗！這時坐在旁邊的Ｌ連忙拖往Ｓ：一面説要打去打矮奴吧！别也玩着鬩牆之爭，凑巧鈴打了，於是各自挾着書去大考了，我跟在他們後面一路走一路想，眞是又氣又好笑，想不到受着大學敎育的人也會説出這等屁話，而所謂愛國志士者，也會幹着這鬩牆的把戲，而自已打自已人，唉！愛國志士，中國學生。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>「騎馬找馬騎」的方法</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>讀了一月八日吳君「認賊作父進退兩難」的信後在下深表同情：不過對於你的答案！我認爲不能十分滿意。因爲你的答案是「辭職爲是，以後的問題，只要肯吃苦，個人生活，不難解决」，而吳君的信上已述及「在申旣無親戚，又無朋友。」假使一旦把職辭了，旣無親友可以投奔，經濟必然困難！食宿都成了問題。即使住小客棧吃大餅油條，每天亦非四角錢不可。這樣下去，一二天内找到生意還好，倘使找不到，日子久了，呌他怎麽支持？</p>
<p>所以我的愚見：趁現在尙未辭職，不如再暫時忍痛受辱一時，以期待着好機會到來，一面在店裏自已勉勵自已，　一面注意報上招考練習生等類的廣告，努力去考，考取之後，再辭去原有職務，此即所謂「騎馬找馬騎」之法。而不至於十分困難了。諸位先生以爲如何？</p>
<p>吳鼎鑫謹啓一月九日</p>
<p>編者按：我們讀罷了上面的一封來信，吳君的深思密虚，與計劃周詳，我們甚爲佩服：並且提出與我們不同的意見更進一步而籌出切實的辦法，尤我們最所歡迎。</p>
<p>不過我們以爲這「騎馬找馬騎」的方法，好固然是好！但以民族的立塲來講，行之於因不滿意頑固商店内的惡劣的環境而另尋出路則可，行之於素以仇敵視之的日本商店，則我們期期以爲不可。</p>
<p>我們還記得：去年「一二八」淞滬血戰，正當劇烈時候的一個汽車夫胡阿毛：駕駛了一輛滿裝敵軍軍火並有四名　兵壓車的汽車，開入黃浦江的一件事！以一個人的性命！換了四個敵人的性命，額外還加添了價値數十萬元的軍火。這種犧牲一已的精神，眞是我大中華民族性的表現！這種精神！曾搏得全國的，以至全世界的同聲贊嘆！至今一年，我們的印象還是很深。</p>
<p>現在，關外的義勇軍，在氷天雪地之中，與敵軍喋血搏戰，雖然給養困難，衣食不週，也不爲敵軍的鉅量金錢所誘惑：雖然後援不繼，兵力單薄，也不爲敵軍重大砲火所脅伏：堅毅不屈的行爲，難能可貴的舉動，民族性的表現，大無畏的犧牲的精神；也博得全國人民的同情，全世界人士的贊嘆！</p>
<p>這樣看來，個人的犧牲算得什麽，我們要站在我們的立塲上，把固有的民族性發揚光大，與我們的仇敵絶對的不合作：這就是我們答覆吳君的微意。</p>
<p>我們基於上述的觀點，同時覺得吳君在仇敵的商店裏，雖然暫時得了物質上的安慰；但精神上是痛苦非凡。（參看吳君自述語）所以我們毅然告以「辭職爲是」；至於吳君辭職後，則當另籌别法，我們寗可俄死，决不應服務於敵　人的食宿問題之不易解决，我們雖無力援助，但我們相信吳君若有「寗餓死不苟活」的决心，定可以得到社會上援助。社會上不能援助，那是國人有負吳君，而吳君則無負於民族！吳君如無這種决心，我們不敢勸他辭職。</p>

<h3>同情者十五續</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>這位東家老爺，原來也是個紳士，因爲現在鄉自治區的權，已經移到新派少年紳士手上去了，他一點聯絡没有。夫各爲了一件小事，被區裏捉住重罰一頓。而且對區裏各位先生，還送了一筆重禮。他這才知道新派人要起錢來，比老派還要厲害，對自治區裏的人，簡直不敢惹了。現在孟國寳又提起了區裏的話，他可有些害怕，因之就不敢再説强話，就把共飯的人拉過一個來，請他轉　，説好説歹，規定了王老二再補兩担稻，没有稻就折十塊錢。這是王老二喜出望外的事，全答應了，因爲他料着，至少也要出廿塊錢呢，這一場交涉完了之後，各人散去，孟國寳也告辭了，王老二帮着二嫂在廚房裏洗碗鍋，看到窗户台上還有一二十粒瓜子，便問道：這是那個留下的瓜子？老二倒是一句無心的話，二嫂子臉却紅起來了，她道：你説是那個留下的呢？廚房裏也不會有第二個人。你這人説話，眞是不中聽，王老二笑道：這也犯不上生氣？他説着就陪着她洗刷碗盞，後又打掃地面，可是他想到剛才一句話，把燒鍋的得罪了，若是老不理會她，她又要生氣了，便無話找話的，向二嫂子道：喂！你看孟三先生好嗎？他這句話，自已是隨便的説了出來，王二嫂聽到，心裏却卜通的跑了一下，紅了臉却不能作事，王老二那裏知道這裏面另有原因，依然眼着向下説道：孟三先生眞好，往年東家來算帳，許多中人，七嘴八舌的，總説不下來什麽。今年孟三先生摸下情面來，三言兩語的就説掉一大半的租稻。他説，和我們種田的人同情，我以先不相信，於今看起來，人家可是實在的話。他這樣解釋了一遍，王二嫂才明白了他的意思，很隨便的道；他也不過一時高興罷了。王老二道：你不要瞎説，人家倒是實心眼子和我要好，你不見這兩天晚上，他總和我談到半夜走嗎？王二嫂却不答言。</p>

<h3>好萊塢影界的消費合作社</h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>美國資本主義發達。經濟富裕，但是回顧到社會裏，失業的還是成羣的在呌救濟，計其人數，也未嘗不與他國並駕齊驅，好萊塢的影界裏，也不免有這不景氣的現象，因此有許多明星發起，本着合作的精神，集資創辦一個消費合作社·開設店舖，以利同人的購買·</p>
<p>店舖裏經售的各種東西，大部份都是貧困人家的失學女子所做成的，其他像傢具古玩和明星個人所有的夜服鞋襪之類，他們自願捐與的，小演員及其他做零散工作的人，生活很艱窘，到這舖子裏買東西，價錢很便宜，經濟上可减少一點負担，</p>
<p>舖子裏的職員，都由明星們的妻子或女兒充當，她們的背景，當然不是爲麵包問題，她們完全替社會盡義務，使貧窮的人，得到普遍的恩惠，明星們自已呢，站着看她們做買賣，還在茶室裏常用投壼等種種遊戲來消遣，引起顧客們不少的興趣，</p>
<p>合作社所賺的錢，完全用於慈善事業上，有許多家裏有小孩而僱不起傭婦的女演員，當她拍戲的時候，同時不能兼顧她的小孩，頗感困難，所以合作社裏，特爲僱就許多女看護，替他們照顧孩子，這裏有許多玩具供給的，華特狄斯</p>
<p>南WaltDisney更繪了滑稽畫片給他們玩，</p>
<p>此外，還有許多别的地方，他們都有實行救濟的機會，假若將他們的紀錄簿翻開，就可以見到内容的一斑，</p>

<h3>「殘生」Six　HouistoLive南京映</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>這是一部給予我們「深刻印像」的「平常」影片！</p>
<p>某小國的代表在日内瓦的國聯會裏，孤獨地與列强爭辯，挽救他的祖國之頻於覆亡，仇視國要使議案，在閉會時通過，於是，在他寓所裏，用繩子勒死他。幸得一位大科學家新發明一種機械，可以起死回生，祇是功效祇有六小時？這外交家便在科學的權威之下復活，他知道自已生命的短促，以及他的愛人没有知道這慘變，决意勸她去愛他的情敵，結果又否决了國聯議案。情節，我們可以説牠是太歪曲，同時也未始不可以説是富理想。全片前三分之一，未免呆滯而後三分之二却充滿剌戟塡活躍。　　華納裴士德飾這位小國代表，在殘餘之六小時生命中的英雄。他有深切，沉着，而堅毅的表演。他在花園裏勸他的情人愛他的情敵之後，他愀然地掏出她方才贈他的玟瑰花！華納死而她還以爲他將伴他宴舞親自送交華僕！以及臨死的吻着鮮花，路上遇見了女賊而把所有的錢物給她，遇見一個貧家幼女問她已死的姊姊的幾　，是怎樣的感動人心，約翰鮑爾士，雖祇幾個塲面，却很有好的貢獻，女主角是新發現的英國少女瑪琳嬌登，亦不失身份，</p>
<p>「航郵俠血」爲美國環球公司出品，以航空郵政爲題材，以航空員之服務精神，爲描寫故　的演進，頗爲緊張，自今天起在　　　映。</p>
<h3>蘇聯影片在滬開映續訉</h3>
<p>— 拾遺</p>
<p>蘇聯著名影片「生活之路」及「二約會」不久即將在滬開映、此訊係得自蘇聯影片公司在滬經理薩耶迭茲君、蕯氏方自寗返滬、據云上述二片、已得中央電影檢查會通過、准許開映、「二約會」片將先開映、該片爲烏林諾夫導演、題材及攝影收音均佳、「生活之路」曾在二十七國開映、在巴黎放映已六月、甚受人歡迎、爲靑年導演家尼古拉伊克所製、描寫舊俄之流浪漢生活、二片俱屬寫實作品、以俄國之實在生活爲背景、在寗審查時、頗蒙稱許云、</p>
<h3>「良心」的法律觀察</h3>
<p>— 其英</p>
<p>哥倫比亞公司的出品，向來是由光陸的專利品。不過近來在聯合公司下的影院，也常有了牠的出品了。牠是比較中新的一家，所以對于新的思想和潮流，牠是很有特長的。當然牠没有歷史的牽制，無舊可守的。</p>
<p>最近在國泰公映的「良心」AttorneyfortheDefence，如果照藝術上的批評，愛德門羅EnmundLowe飾一個退職的律師，他的口才和態度，眞是很驚人的。因爲劇旨的連屬性，他也常有地方帶着冷雋幽默的意味，配角極少出現，所以不能談什麽，導演等等功過相等不足毁譽，不過我認爲這片子是極好的，牠另有過人的優長！</p>
<p>我所説的就是這一片的本事和劇旨，牠能指出法律在二十世紀中葉，所佔地位的重要，並且攻擊現代法律的弱點。在中國影片中，根本没有談到過法律。卽使外國影片中，帶有法律丨法院丨的描寫的，多一半也都是由當事人丨訴訟丨作一個主體，所以在觀察上不免有所偏重。　一部影片是太大的例外，牠　進了法律的表皮，作内幕的研究，把　國的現行司法内幕不加僞錦的揭開了。牠把一個律師來玩弄陪審官　和推事依仗了滔滔雄辯顚倒案情于掌握之中　明顯的説出法律在現代有極大的缺憾，决不能爲弱者呼冤。</p>
<p>當然牠形容「英美法，」根據於判例的弱點。但是我相信如中國所採用的「成文法」也有相當的差謬。這片子也引證出法律的完善，必須求于律師本身律師不改革，法律也就没有進步。</p>
<p>喜歡看法律影片的，那末這是唯一的佳片了。不過其中法學專名詞和「判例」過多，未免减少了興味。不過我希望上海的推事，法學家，律師，特别是研究「英美法」的人，都去看看，因爲牠是一部有益的實際參考書，</p>
<h3>觀衆談言　談談「流浪者」</h3>
<p>— 聲宏</p>
<p>最近，在北方戰雲　温的形勢下，光陸和蘭心大戲院仝時開映福司公司佳片丨滑稽巨子惠爾羅傑士新傑作的「流浪者，」該劇全篇立意新頴，主演詼諧諷剌，女主角曼琳鼐格蓀，是一粒新進的明星，表演有顯著的進步：她的玲瓏活潑的舉動，頗能助長劇情的進展，惠爾羅傑士在這劇中所飾的主角，是從「浩浩乎，平沙無垠······」的戰塲中歸來的漂泊街頭的流浪者，</p>
<p>全劇大意是描寫一個靑年，别妻投軍，他的嬌妻不慣夜夜寒　，出門别覓彩凰，戰事爆發不久，他的妻子遺下一女，魂歸天國，女由後夫撫養成人，風姿綽約，和後夫佳兒靑梅竹馬，兩小無猜，現在他倆俱屆成人之年，益形相親相愛，後夫暗中玉成其事，以慰在九泉下的愛人，後靑年從軍者，由前線歸來，已無家可歸，漂泊街頭，枕天席地，長度每天的「流浪者」的生活，但暗中仍不絶打聽愛女消息，不久終償如願，但靑年發見愛女生活富裕，已成一社會上富紳婦女，他沈浸在大自然中内心中感至無上的歡慰，</p>
<p>數天後，他離開了這個地方，奔赴天涯海角，重度他「流浪者」的生活了！</p>
<h3>三個摩登女性中的最摩登者</h3>
<p>— 夏叔訓</p>
<p>眞正的摩登女性，是有理智的，英勇的，能夠自食其力的，你看周淑貞，她是一個少資産階級的女子，多理智，多英勇，能够自食其力的，一旦被公司革職，她不怕，並且還帶微笑的説：「咱們有咱們的雙手，還怕什麽呢？上帝生我們雙手作何用？况且，我又是爲着羣衆而犧牲的呀」！的確，一個人，在這奇形怪狀的社會中，只要有手肯努力的來做！那怕你到處不好吃飯，雖然，她在物質上受了些痛苦；但是在精神上，還依舊地過着眞實的愉快，互相慰藉，互相諒解。</p>
<p>所以，我可大胆地在斷定的立場上説一句「該片中最摩登的是要算一個少資産階級的而革命氣味十足的周淑貞了」。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>皮佛萊山巓的野鴨園</h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>好萊塢男星羅蘭特楊RolandYoung有一個怪癖，他生性最歡喜野鴨，他的朋友，送禮物給他時，不論什麽寳貴珍品，雖然價値連城，他不以爲奇的，但假如送一對野鴨給他，那眞有形容不出的快樂，所以每逢耶穌聖誕節，他收到的禮物，十九是野鴨，</p>
<p>他初到好萊塢時，和約翰巴里穆爾合演的SherlockHojmes遠在十五年之前，這十五年之中，他自已買的和朋友們送的野鴨不知多少，他一槪好好畜養他在皮佛萊山建築的一所住宅，簡直是一所野鴨園，在好萊塢也有個小聲名，去參觀的人也不少，</p>
<p>羅蘭特楊的怪癖自小就如此，小時他父母領他到動物園去，他看見鴨就吵着不肯回去，後來他的父母買了兩隻鴨回去才罷，他除了愛鴨之外，其他動物都很寳貝，凡在馬路上或無論什麽地方看見貓没有東西吃，他捉回去小心餧養，不過他最愛的是野鴨，所以産生了個别出心裁的野鴨園，</p>
<h3>克萊拉寳近訊</h3>
<p>— 邨</p>
<p>CallHer　Savage已告竣了，雖説這是克萊拉寳攝片以來最成功的一張，然而她是否因成功而繼續努力，現在還是問題，説不定她先要到歐洲去遊歷一趟，並經過一次長時期的休息，然後或再想攝别片，她給福克斯訂的合同，曾這樣誇大的説：「没有佳構不幹的。」</p>
<h3>安哈婷漸萌退志</h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>安哈婷AnnHarding近來風頭不如從前了。她聲明，攝完已簽合同的兩張新片以後，她要不幹銀幕生活了，因爲她説作了電影業，把自已快樂都剥削去了。好萊塢不少人也感覺到她近來常有悲觀的表示，不過一部份却猜想，如果她新攝的兩張片子能有意外的收獲。那末她現在的態度，也會無形消滅。不知到底猜得對不對，只有安哈婷自已心裏明白。</p>
<h3>「火柴大王」本事（六）</h3>
<p>— 希孟譯</p>
<p>「保羅，保羅」，桑尼阿顯然已中了保羅催眠術的控制，「我們還要等待多少時候，寳貝」？「没有多少時候了，但是我們必定要耐性些。羅定斯基喜歡你麽」？</p>
<p>「唉，他亦愛不了我許多。他的事情很忙，這幾天總是愁眉不展的」。</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢」？</p>
<p>「財政部發見了五百五十萬的虧空，羅定斯基這幾天日夜奔走設法彌補」。</p>
<p>保羅跳了起來。拿了帽子就往外跑。</p>
<p>「你往那裏去」？女人驚駭得不可名狀的問。</p>
<p>「你可以想像得出的，親愛的，無論什麽事，能使我片刻與你相離，這一定是件極要緊的」</p>
<p>事了」。</p>
<p>「你回來麽」？</p>
<p>「一回兒就回來」。</p>
<p>「我不知道還是相信你的好，還是不相信你的好。大槪你又從我探聽了什麽消息，又要離開我了」。</p>
<p>保羅不慌不忙地從衣袋裏摸出一個戒指來。</p>
<p>「寳貝，這是我母親的結婚戒指，在我看起來，這是世界上最寳貴的東西了」。他將戒指套　　在桑尼阿的手指上，低下頭輕輕地吻着。「這就我的證據」。</p>
<p>桑尼阿眼望着那隻極簡單的金戒指，眼眶中包滿了快樂之淚。</p>
<p>保羅史魯爾去見羅定斯基的時候，羅定斯基被保羅發現了他的秘密，驚駭得手足無所措，但還竭力裝出鎭靜的神氣，口口聲聲的説「克魯爾你瘋了麽？你一定聽錯了。」但是他的嘴唇已經顯出灰白色，頻頻的震動，表示出他的失敗，無助驚訝，　　，與悲慘。</p>
<p>保羅一方面，係胸有成算，但報以微微的一笑。他已知勝利　屬於他的。他站了起來。「你要是能够使内閣中的朋友接受我的建設，就是他們所需要的錢，五十萬元的庫劵，就在桑尼阿床上枕頭底下，這係我送給你的一些小禮物。」</p>
<p>羅定斯基有氣無力地説「須知道　是敲詐的行爲。」</p>
<p>「這　自然」保羅笑笑</p>
<p>「你怎麽知道桑尼亞的？」羅定斯基隔了許多時候，　氣似的問。</p>
<p>「這是我的本領，每樣事却知道一些，歐洲每　大人物，無論男妇，我　稍爲認　」</p>
<p>羅定斯基假作鎭靜，劃了一根火柴吸烟，但他的手是震頗的。他説「很好，克魯爾，我現　　在就可以决定内閣一定可以將波蘭國内的火柴專賣權給你。」（未完）</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Retreat from Koumenkou</h3>
<p>Zheng Guilin's Troops Flank the Enemy's Rear</p>
<p>Our Troops Occupy High Ground, Making It Difficult for the Enemy to Succeed</p>
<p>Several Sections of the Great Wall Destroyed by Enemy Bombardment</p>
<p>The Situation in Qinhuangdao Is Critical</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has launched another attack on Koumenkou. At the same time, enemy traces have been discovered in Shimen Village and Lijia Fort, with fierce fighting occurring. Our troops are in a difficult situation. After our reinforcements arrived, they launched a head-on attack. Simultaneously, 3,000 troops from the volunteer army led by Zheng Guilin launched from Shihegou to flank the enemy at Lijia Fort. The enemy collapsed and concentrated in Wanjia Village, turning the situation from danger to safety for our army. Zheng's troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese at Gaoling. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 11:00 PM last night, the Japanese army's Miyake unit, consisting of field artillery, attacked our positions in two directions. One route attacked Koumenkou from Wanjia Village outside the pass, and the other route pressed Shimen Village from the Liujiang River. After resistance from a certain regiment of the 0th Brigade, the enemy fired over 200 shells, destroying several sections of the Great Wall at Koumenkou. On the morning of the 11th, the enemy dispatched five aircraft to assist in the bombing. Our soldiers stationed at Koumenkou and Shimen Village are willing to coexist with the city and are determined to defend it to the death. Their morale is high, and fierce fighting is ongoing. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday morning, the main force of the Japanese army, under the cover of aircraft, attacked Koumenkou. Our troops fought bravely, and the fighting was fierce. There have been no changes to the Shihe Line. Enemy aircraft scouted and dropped bombs in the area of Fudian and Haiyang Town, east and west of the Shihe River. No enemy aircraft have been seen over Qinhuangdao for three days. Last night, the lights suddenly went out at the Yuguan Railway Station and the Beining Railway Factory, and locomotives were being moved back and forth, reportedly due to the Japanese army mobilizing troops or other intentions. Qinhuangdao is being maintained by a certain unit. Tao has assumed the concurrent post of Linyu County Magistrate, and the county government is temporarily located in a certain place. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese warship anchored at Qinhuangdao sailed away on the morning of the 9th. A destroyer patrolled the sea area in front of Yuguan, Suizhong, and other areas. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The telephone line between Beiping and Qinhuangdao experienced a temporary disruption due to excessive wind force after 3:00 PM yesterday. It was restored that evening. This morning, the line was unclear again due to strong winds. Qinhuangdao has suddenly become tense since the Japanese marines landed. Stores that had reopened have closed again. Our armored vehicles are still stationed outside the port, guarding the railway. There is no fighting on the Shihe front line. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The battle at Koumenkou is extremely fierce. The Japanese army stationed in Yuguan transferred 300 troops last night to reinforce Koumenkou. Detailed battle situation is unknown. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu: After the enemy retreated from Koumenkou to Lijia Fort, more than a hundred puppet police officers harassed the area on the 11th, from morning to night. Although there were occasional gunshots from the enemy, there was no intense warfare. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu: Two trains carrying infantry and artillery departed from Yuguan Station on the evening of the 11th for Wanjia Village to attack Koumenkou. There are rumors that Japanese warships in Qinhuangdao are scheduled to bombard Qinhuangdao's streets on the 12th. There are currently three Japanese warships and two Japanese merchant ships in the area, fully loaded with ammunition for supplies, which are being unloaded gradually. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qinhuangdao telegram: This morning, our forward sentry captured an enemy spy, who was immediately sent to headquarters. According to the confession, the Japanese plan is to first attack Koumenkou, because after the Japanese army occupied Yuguan, they planned to cut off our defense line from Yuguan to Koumenkou. With the discovery of the Japanese plot, He Zhuguo immediately ordered his troops to be on strict guard. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Qinhuangdao is very tense. The Japanese army's defense line is only 300 meters away from the railway. At night, naval warships shine searchlights on the city. The 5th Regiment of Gu Yi, stationed in Dongluocheng, Yuguan, moved about 200 troops towards Jiaoshan, fifteen li northeast of Yuguan, on the morning of the 10th, with the intention of threatening our army at Koumenkou. Today, the Japanese army on the Shihe front has not taken any action. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The volunteer army led by Zheng Guilin has been attacking the Japanese army's rear lines outside the pass for several consecutive days. Since the Yuguan Incident, there has been contact every day. On January 2nd, they attacked the vanguard in Qian'suo. On the 3rd, they attacked the vanguard of Qian'suo, Gaoling, and Suizhong. On the 4th, they attacked Majiayingzi and broke Er'dong. On the 5th, they attacked Qianyin'zhang and Koumentai. On the 6th, they attacked Tie'ertai. On the 7th, they attacked Lijia Fort. On the 8th, they attacked Tieling Fort. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the enemy occupied Yuguan, fearing that our army would exit Koumenkou and cut off their communication, the Suzuki Brigade sent a regiment north. They made contact with our army on the 7th and were repelled. The enemy then reinforced with one regiment each of infantry and cavalry, and one company of artillery, and attacked in three routes. A conflict occurred on the morning of the 10th, with exceptionally intense artillery fire. The Japanese News Agency publicized that the Japanese army had completely occupied it by 9:00 AM on the 10th, which is completely untrue. On the evening of the 11th, reporters inquired with the Japanese military headquarters stationed in Tianjin. According to them, as of 6:00 PM on the 11th, fighting was still ongoing and they had not received any reports of occupation. There were also conflicts in Shimen Village. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The transportation sector received a telegram from the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau stating that the Japanese army attacked Koumenkou again on the 11th. Our army has received considerable reinforcements, morale is extremely high, and the enemy has made no progress. The Japanese are claiming in Beiping and Tianjin that they have occupied Koumenkou, which is absolutely untrue. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government has never considered the Japanese army's forcible occupation of Yuguan a local issue, but rather as part of the entire Sino-Japanese problem. Recently, the situation in the Qinhuangdao area has become serious, and the Japanese army has begun to attack the strategic pass of Koumenkou. In order to understand the actual situation on the ground, the government has specially dispatched Vice Minister Liu Chongjie to the north to inspect and discuss everything with Zhang. After the matter is completed, he will return to Beijing to report. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army continued to launch a fierce attack on Koumenkou yesterday and today, and the battle was very fierce. Our defending troops are a cavalry brigade. Japanese aircraft repeatedly arrived in Qinhuangdao to distribute propaganda, claiming that the Japanese army had occupied Koumenkou. The local residents are well aware of the Japanese people's habitual techniques of spreading rumors and were not moved by them. The Koumenkou area has suddenly become cold. Our army occupies a high position, making it very difficult for the Japanese army to attack. Japanese casualties are high, and many mules and horses have been abandoned. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Righteous Army of the North China National Salvation Association sends a telegram to He Zhuguo and Zhu Qing to express condolences. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a certain military expert, Koumenkou and Shimen Village have undulating hills and rugged roads. The terrain is dangerous and strategically important, making it a place that has been contested by military strategists since ancient times. It is easy to defend but difficult to attack. However, our army has troops stationed in both places. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is rumored in Beiping that the Qinhuangdao Telephone Bureau and Telegraph Bureau have been occupied by Japanese soldiers. Reporters investigated with the transportation authorities and found that this is completely untrue. The area is peaceful. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There is no intense fighting in Shihe either. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There will be several days of quiet on all fronts. This is not the result of negotiations, but rather due to the weather. There are currently strong winds in North China, which are as sharp as scissors, making it impossible for battles to take place. Chinese authorities still claim that Koumenkou has not been lost. Upon investigation, the Koumenkou fortress is two miles long, and what the Chinese soldiers are guarding appears to be the south entrance, but the north entrance has already been sealed off by the Japanese army. (Eleventh Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The British and American embassies have now received a telegram from China protesting to the signatories of the 1901 treaty, opposing Japan's illegal use of the Beining Railway to attack and occupy Yuguan. (Eleventh Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to travelers who arrived here from Yuguan, the city is gradually returning to normal. Many shops have reopened, and civilians are returning home one after another. Japanese flags are hanging everywhere, and the entire city is patrolled by Japanese soldiers. The damage suffered by Yuguan was mostly due to artillery fire. It is said that most of the damage was within a hundred yards of the South Gate, and the South Gate has been destroyed. (Eleventh Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Qinhuangdao) A special Reuters correspondent here learned today that a Manchu detective was executed by order of General He Zhuguo. The correspondent traveled to the cavalry brigade of the Chinese army's northern front line, ten miles north of Qinhuangdao. The brigade commander told the correspondent in his headquarters that there is currently a large unit of the Japanese army in Yuguan, carrying tanks and artillery. They have not shown any signs of attacking for days. There are currently pseudo-Manchukuo troops in Koumenkou, including about one hundred cavalry and some infantry. The Chinese army's front line reaches Shimen'an in the north and the coast in the south. After returning to Qinhuangdao, the correspondent visited the Chinese army's front line south of the railway and saw that General He Zhuguo's deployment was very thorough, but the defense area was very large, and the troops were weak. It is feared that it would be difficult to resist the fierce attack of a large number of well-equipped enemy troops. (Eleventh Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Various Areas in Jehol</h3>
<p>Thirty-Five Trains Carrying Japanese Soldiers Depart from Shenyang</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Decides to Instigate Pseudo-State Troops to Invade Jehol</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy's plan to seize Jehol is becoming more urgent. They are busy increasing troops and transporting weapons every day. The enemy and the Righteous Army only have small-scale contact every day and have not yet formally invaded. Our army is on strict alert. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese aircraft scouted over Chengde, Chaoyang, Beipiao, and other places yesterday and began to bomb various key points on the Suizhong-Lingyuan highway. Pingquan, Boli Mountain, Wohutun, Dingmatang, and other places were all destroyed by Japanese aircraft. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Thirty-five trains carrying Japanese soldiers departed from Shenyang on the 9th, most of them disembarked at Goubangzi, Dahushan, and Jin County, and advanced towards Fuxin and Suidong in northern Jehol. Among these trains, fifteen were troops of the pseudo-Manchukuo, led by former Zhili-Shandong United Army division commander Fang Yongchang. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed the Ministry of Military Affairs yesterday, stating that according to reports, Japan and the pseudo-state will invade Jehol and disrupt the situation in Beiping and Tianjin around the time of the Lunar New Year. In light of the previous sacrifices in Shanghai and the international criticism, Japan has decided to use pseudo-state troops to invade Jehol and use bandit troops composed of frustrated soldiers and reactionary soldiers to disrupt the situation in Beiping and Tianjin, with the Japanese directing from behind. He vowed to serve the country with his life. If the Japanese invade, he will launch a head-on attack, regardless of success or failure. He only requests that the national forces provide assistance. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>

<h3>He Zhuguo Denies Reports of the Fall of Koumenkou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo telegraphed Beiping this morning, stating that the Japanese attack on Koumenkou was repeatedly repelled by our army. Foreign reports that Koumenkou fell yesterday are absolutely untrue. Koumenkou is still being defended by our 0th Brigade, relying on the terrain. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Japanese cavalry attacked Koumenkou from Wanjia Village, and fierce fighting occurred with our army at Jihua Ridge. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Our army, relying on the natural barrier and occupying the high ground, repelled three attacks by a large force of Japanese troops supervising pseudo-state troops. Our army poured water on the slopes of Koumenkou to create ice, making it difficult for the Japanese army to advance. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Responds to China's Protest</h3>

They hope that the government will quickly establish a resistance plan so that soldiers in various places can provide practical assistance and the central government will stop making empty promises.

<p>Stuttgart: Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan of China, suddenly left the hospital in Speyer this morning due to the serious situation in the Far East.

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Chongjie, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, went north today after paying visits to Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, and others for instructions.

<p>(Nanjing) Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie is taking a train to Beiping tonight. Official circles are unwilling to announce his mission, but it is reported that Liu will inform Zhang Xueliang in detail of the government's attitude towards the Yuguan case. It is widely believed that having a responsible representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Beiping will be beneficial to the matter. It is reported that Liu will remain in Beiping until the situation in North China eases. The government considers the Yuguan incident to be part of the entire Sino-Japanese problem and cannot be treated as a local incident to be resolved locally. (Eleventh Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Shenyang Pseudo-Army Guerrillas Revolt</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A certain regiment of the Shenyang Jing'an Guerrilla Force was ordered last week to attack Deng Tie-mei's troops, led by a certain Japanese lieutenant colonel and twenty Japanese soldiers. After arriving in Fengcheng, the guerrillas in the Third District suddenly fired into the sky to signal the Righteous Army. The Japanese army then ordered the Jing'an Force to return to Shenyang and planned to punish them.

<h3>League of Nations Mediation of Sino-Japanese Case Offers Little Hope</h3>
<p>Preparing to Draft Report</p>
<p>Forcing Both Sides to Accept</p>
<p>Still Trying to Avoid Direct Conflict with Japan</p>
<p>(Geneva) A Sino-Japanese settlement is now generally considered hopeless. Those directing League of Nations policy behind the scenes are busy planning the course to be taken when the Committee of Nineteen meets next week. It now seems inevitable that the next step will be to apply Section 4 of Article 15 of the League Covenant, which stipulates that "if the dispute is not settled, the Council, either unanimously or by majority vote, shall prepare a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are deemed just and proper by the Council." It is widely understood that there is little possibility of using delaying tactics to seek repeated postponements. Therefore, serious consideration is being given to the drafting of a report that the League Assembly must prepare. It is said that there is a trend to adopt the draft resolution of the Committee of Nineteen and its explanatory memorandum as the basis for the report, with appropriate revisions. This is to base the solution on the proposals of the Lytton Report. It is hoped that this outline can be used to draft a report that expresses the will of the League member states in a careful manner, while avoiding a break with Japan. However, Japan seems unlikely to accept the general endorsement of the Lytton Report, and China will also demand a solution that at least allows it freedom of action. Japanese chief delegate Matsuoka, recently touring the Near East and Italy, will return to Geneva tomorrow. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, Yan Huiqing, Gu Weijun, and Guo Qinqi have all arrived in Geneva and reported by telegram that they are awaiting the outcome of the meeting of the Committee of Nineteen. They will then observe the proceedings of the Committee of Nineteen, and if mediation proves hopeless, they will draft a report based on the Covenant, proposing a solution and forcing both sides to accept it. If either party refuses to accept, economic sanctions will be imposed. Our representatives have repeatedly submitted to the League of Nations reports on the Japanese military occupation of Shanhaiguan and the expansion of Japanese war actions. At the same time, they have also submitted a written request to the League of Nations, urging it to pay attention to its own responsibilities and promptly stop Japan's expanding military actions to avoid endangering world peace, and to order Japan to withdraw its troops as soon as possible in accordance with the League of Nations resolutions and restore the situation before September 18.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>How is the Reality of "Resistance"? 力</h3>
<p>After encompassing our Northeast, the violent Japan brazenly disregards everything, advances to occupy Yu Pass, the national territory shrinks daily, and the national situation is in danger. People throughout the country are pained and indignant. Even those who previously advocated caution now seem to have changed their minds and advocate actual resistance to save our nation from its perilous state. Speeches by Zhang Xueliang, telegrams from Yan Xishan, Han Fuqu, and others, and even Liu Xiang, who is deeply involved in civil war, has stated that "the civil war will be ended and we will unite to resist foreign aggression." This can be said to be national unity. However, Yu Pass has been occupied for more than ten days, and in fact, the authorities' response to this incident is still nothing more than issuing protests to Japan and continuing to appeal to the League of Nations. So where is the so-called advocacy of actual resistance?</p>
<p>We believe that even a child of three feet tall is already clear about the current aggression of Japanese imperialism. It cannot be stopped by "protests" or even "serious protests." Their continental policy has been carefully considered and thoroughly planned. They brazenly disregard world opinion, and what more do they care about empty "protests?" The League of Nations itself is just a group of the strong. The facts of the past year can also prove that "justice" cannot be achieved by appeals. Even if we pour out our grievances again today, how can we be sure that it will be effective? Therefore, the only way to deal with today's situation is to "fight to the death" in order to "fight for survival," to "achieve justice," and to stop the violent actions of the imperialists. This is an undeniable truth. To talk about saving the country without this is empty talk.</p>
<p>The aggressive and violent actions of Japanese imperialism today are enough to shock the whole world. But on the other hand, our country's extreme concession and extreme endurance, being subjected to trampling without resistance, is also a rare sight in today's world. Only because we have extreme concession and endurance do we have such a brazen and reckless enemy. If our country had resisted desperately from the beginning of the September 18th Incident, it would not have been so reckless. Instead, we have endured and procrastinated, waiting to be slaughtered. We have been indifferent as if nothing had happened, and then we have begged others for help. The loss of Yu Pass today and the continuous advance of the Japanese army are the result of this. How can this be without reason?</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper's Beiping correspondent reported that a foreign newspaper in the Northeast commented that "the Chinese nation is truly a lazy nation. The means adopted by Japan to deal with this kind of lazy nation are extremely correct. If these means were applied to any Western nation, there would not be a day of peace." Although their words are arrogant, the stones from other hills can be used to polish jade. We should also seriously consider this. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini said, "Words are beautiful, but guns are more beautiful." The humiliation that no country in the world can tolerate, the suffering that no one can endure, we want to solve everything with "words" such as protests and appeals. How can this be possible?</p>
<p>In short, today's situation is urgent and allows no further hesitation. The sun flag flying over Shanhaiguan may advance and fly over the city walls of Beijing at any time, even spreading throughout our country. There should be an end to endurance and a limit to concession. The people of the whole country are now looking to our government to show the facts. These facts are not "mediation," not "negotiation," not "protests," not "appeals," but actual action. What will happen to today's events?</p>
<h3>No Change in US Far East Policy</h3>
<p>After Roosevelt Meets with Stimson</p>
<p>Believes No Need to Reiterate at Present</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson has completed his visit to New York to meet with President-elect Roosevelt and will return to Washington tonight. Political circles are well aware that Roosevelt refused to cooperate with Hoover. This meeting with Stimson was merely to inquire about the facts. Therefore, the general public is not paying much attention to this matter. It is said that Roosevelt generally agrees with Stimson's Far East policy, but believes that there is no need to reiterate the US view on the Far East at present. (Tenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>▲Osaka Asahi Shimbun Washington Special Dispatch After the outbreak of the Yu Pass Incident, although the US State Department authorities were quite calm, the future development is indeed worrying. From the official American point of view, it is generally said that "American policy believes that Secretary of State Stimson has clearly stated in the note to Japan on January 7 last year and in the document submitted by Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Borah on February 4 that there will be no change in the original agreement in the future." From this, it can be inferred that the principle of not recognizing Manchukuo, even in the era of the next President Roosevelt, is unlikely to change the policy. Currently, the US government believes that if the Japanese army crosses the Great Wall and invades the Chinese mainland, it will inevitably cause major new problems for the peace treaty, and on the other hand, it will inevitably lead to disputes with the Soviet Union. The current Hoover administration lacks authority due to the imminent change of new and old, so there will be no action. For example, the issue of war debts, like the lack of progress in the Sino-Japanese issue, is because both Hoover and Roosevelt are unwilling to make positive decisions. Recently, Ambassador Debuchi visited Undersecretary of State Castle for the Yu Pass Incident, and the First Secretary of the Chinese Embassy visited Horiuchi, Director of the Far East Bureau. US officials are unwilling to express any opinions.</p>
<h3>Hoover Proposes Arms Embargo to Congress</h3>
<p>Original Bill Repeatedly Modified, Practically a Mere Formality</p>
<p>Sufficient to See the Power of Manufacturers to Control the Government</p>
<p>Geneva Convention Unlikely to be Ratified by the Senate</p>
<p>(Washington) US President Hoover today submitted to Congress a bill to ban the export of arms, but its content is no longer as originally intended by the State Department. The phrase "the President may prohibit exports at any time" has been amended to "the President may restrict the export of arms after obtaining the cooperation of other countries." Therefore, many in Congress say that this shows the power of American arms manufacturers to control national policy. After this amendment, the bill has little practical effect and is almost a mere formality. The US President also sent a special report urging the Senate to ratify the international convention on the prohibition of arms trafficking signed in Geneva on June 17, 1925, saying that if this convention cannot be ratified, then Congress must urgently pass a bill authorizing the President to prohibit the transportation of arms for military use after obtaining the cooperation of major arms manufacturing countries. In addition, he also attached a letter from Secretary of State Stimson to the President, the content of which was a suggestion that the President should ask Congress to authorize the government to prohibit the transportation of arms to warring countries in order to enhance the effectiveness of the Pact of Paris. This bill had been drafted by the State Department for a long time and shelved in the White House until it was submitted to Congress today. The reason why it was revised before being submitted to Congress was because of the opposition of certain cabinet members and arms manufacturers. It is rumored that one section was completely changed, and there were many other modifications, so members of Congress said that this bill would have little effect. After the bill was delivered to Congress, Senator Borah immediately stated that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would consider the Geneva Convention tomorrow. The convention has been shelved in the Senate for several years and has not been voted on. However, according to Borah, the committee may not necessarily approve the convention. At the same time, Assistant Secretary of State Rogers also declared in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that President-elect Roosevelt is still free to decide on the US plan to attend the international disarmament conference. The State Department has not accepted any constraints and has not agreed to its agenda. (Tenth National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Senator Advocates Concluding a New International Treaty</h3>
<p>Supporting the Stimson Doctrine</p>
<p>(Washington) US Senator King believes that the Kellogg-Briand Pact has little effect on maintaining world peace. Today, he specially submitted a resolution to the Senate requesting the conclusion of a new international treaty to support the US policy of not recognizing territories acquired by force. He advocated authorizing the President to negotiate international treaties to prohibit the use of force to seize territory in order to avoid wars. King's intention is to recognize that countries can conclude a treaty in which all territories acquired by undeclared wars or after declarations of war are illegal acts. According to King, a Democrat, this type of treaty will of course be handled by the Democratic government. (Tenth National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Holds the Key to the Manchurian Case</h3>
<p>Indecisive Attitude Toward Japan is Clearly Inappropriate</p>
<p>丨Cecil Publishes a Letter丨</p>
<p>(London) The Times this morning published a letter from Sir Cecil in an important position, stating that Britain holds the key to both the Manchurian and disarmament issues. The Yu Pass Incident shows the danger of a vacillating policy. The world hopes that the British side will provide clear and courageous guidance. He believes that if the League Assembly handles the matter courageously based on the Lytton Report, neither side would dare to disobey. But if one side disobeys, then the League members must consult with other countries. Cecil and Gray are chairmen of the British League of Nations Society. Cecil is known for his support of the League of Nations. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Tries Hard to Win Over Britain</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to diplomatic circles, Japan is focusing on Britain in its response to the Committee of Nineteen. It begs Britain to remember the old friendship of the Anglo-Japanese alliance in order to formulate a new plan favorable to Japan through an Anglo-Japanese compromise and to put pressure on the smaller countries. Therefore, it ordered Matsuoka not to tour Britain, but to return to Geneva early and work with Sugimura Yotaro to win over Drummond. Sugimura and Drummond have secretly negotiated several times, but have not achieved good results. Although Britain intends to favor Japan, it has not found suitable words to perfunctorily satisfy the world. In addition, the Yu Pass Incident has occurred, and the anger of European and American people against Japan is becoming more and more fierce. In order to maintain its reputation in Europe and the United States, Britain feels it is difficult to be friends with the violent Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very anxious after hearing the news. (Eleventh China United News Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Simon Arrives in Paris to Meet Pongou</h3>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Simon, who has been convalescing in Monte Carlo, unexpectedly arrived here today and met with French Prime Minister Pongou. At that time, the French cabinet was holding a meeting to discuss the budget. The meeting between the British and French politicians was short but very friendly. This was the first time Pongou had met Simon since taking office as Prime Minister. At half past twelve in the afternoon, Simon took a plane back to London, will handle diplomatic affairs for two days, and then rushed to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Committee of Nineteen on Monday.

<h3>Soviet Russia Upholds Peace and Never Forgets National Defense</h3>
<p>Stalin Says Neglecting Heavy Industry Would Mean</p>
<p>Inability to Resist Strong Neighbors if They Invade</p>
<p>Japan Has No Intention of Concluding a Non-Aggression Pact with Russia</p>
<p>(Moscow) Stalin, as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party and the de facto head of the Soviet government, declared today that Soviet industrial output at the end of 1932 was 334 percent greater than before the war. Stalin refuted the criticism of Russia's industrial policy, saying that if Russia abandoned or delayed its current industrialization policy and produced more clothing and shoes, it would not be able to have a locomotive or automobile industry, and it would not have important steel and iron factories, and it would be in a position of being unable to defend against capitalist neighbors who have modern weapons. Its situation would be the same as that of China today. (Tenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Ministry officials said that the real reason why the Japanese military demanded a huge military budget for the next fiscal year in Stalin's speech to the Central Committee of the Communist Party was because the Soviet Union, on the one hand, asked Japan to conclude a non-aggression treaty, and on the other hand, prepared the national industry for war. Therefore, the possibility of concluding a non-aggression treaty with Russia today has finally disappeared. (Eleventh Dentus Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Expands Air Force</h3>
<p>Military Plans to Build 300 Airfields</p>
<p>Training a Large Number of Pilots for Combat</p>
<p>▲China United News Tokyo Dispatch on the 11th Since the failure of the Pacific crossing in 1929, the Japan Aviation Association has become increasingly passive. Recently, it has been urged by the military to start activities again this spring. Its work is to expand the air force. At present, there are about 380 civilian pilots in Japan. Because the country needs too few, there are often those who have not flown for a year. In this way, what they have learned becomes useless. If a war breaks out, this air force reserve cannot be applied in time. The Japan Aviation Association has seen this and has prepared several new types of aircraft for the practice and use of unemployed pilots. In addition, it mobilized the national rural army and youth corps, and persuaded local wealthy people to donate airfields. The youth corps and rural army must build airfields with obligation. The country will build up to 300 airfields. It is heard that there are already a dozen or so places where construction has begun. Hundreds of airfields will soon be realized in various parts of Japan.</p>
<h3>Mexican People</h3>
<p>Raid Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>▲China United News Tokyo Dispatch on the 11th According to a report received by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Japanese Embassy in Mexico, on the morning of the 9th, about 60 Mexican people, chanting slogans such as "Down with Japan" and "Down with Aggressors" along the way, gathered in front of the Japanese Embassy. Some people gave speeches to the crowd, scolding the Japanese army for its unprovoked invasion of China and the seizure of Shanhaiguan by force. The crowd was extremely angry for a time, and then threw stones at the embassy and vandalized it. The windows and doors of the Japanese Embassy were completely destroyed. The Japanese embassy staff urgently notified the Mexican police, who sent a large number of police to suppress the situation, and the crowd dispersed.</p>
<h3>German Newspaper "Vorwärts" Worries About the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>If Japan's Militarism is Not Curtailed</p>
<p>World War II Will Break Out Soon</p>
<p>(Berlin) The famous socialist newspaper "Vorwärts" commented on the Far East situation today, saying that if Japan's militarism is not immediately curtailed by international action, then a new world war will arrive in an instant.

The situation became even more serious after the Shanghai war. After the ceasefire, it gradually calmed down. Recently, Japanese troops suddenly occupied Yuguan, and the situation in North China is urgent. The Yangtze River region will inevitably have demonstrations again. Five Japanese warships, Ataka, Hira, Tsushima, Atami, and Kotaka, which were originally docked in Hankou, opened another Uji on the 8th. They are all docked on the Jiangmian River in the Japanese Concession, connected from end to end. The highest military officer is Sakano, commander of the 1st Foreign Dispatch Fleet. On the 6th, he led 24 platoons of marines to land for tactical exercises, firing live ammunition. It lasted a long time. At 11:00 AM on the 9th, he also inspected the marines of the six ships, Uji, Tsushima, Hira, Atami, Ataka, and Kotaka, and more than 1,000 marines stationed in Hankou on Kawamura Street in the Japanese Concession. After Sakano finished speaking and inspecting, he went to the banquet of Japanese overseas Chinese. It was decided that at 8:00 AM on the 10th, he would take the Atami warship to the west to inspect the Japanese warships in the upper reaches, and the Hira would follow him. It is scheduled to arrive in Yichang on the 15th, head east on the 18th, and return to Hankou on the 20th. Wang Shoutin, commander of the Chinese Navy's torpedo fleet stationed in Hankou, said that because diplomacy is strained and Japanese warships are being transferred frequently, he has redeployed the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. From Yichang to Wuxue, a total of more than 20 warships, including Minquan, Chu Tai, Jiang Kun, Chu Tong, Chu You, Chu Qian, Wei Sheng, Jiang Xi, Shun Sheng, Cheng Sheng, De Sheng, Ren Sheng, Yi Sheng, and Chen-class torpedo boats and Su-class torpedo boats, are stationed there, and the river defense is extremely solid.

<h3>He Jian's Grief and Indignation at the Fall of Yuguan</h3>
<p>Telegraphs Zhang Xueliang to Supervise the Troops and Kill the Enemy</p>
<p>Urges Sichuan and Guizhou Generals to Stop Fighting and Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the news of the fall of Yuguan reached Hunan, the people of the three Hunan regions were extremely indignant. Various groups of farmers, businesses, industries, students, and women in the province and city scheduled to hold an emergency joint meeting at the Sun Yat-sen Hall on the 7th to discuss countermeasures. It is said that three proposals have been predetermined: (1) Eliminate all enemy goods in Changsha City. From now on, anyone found smuggling enemy goods will be executed. (2) Petition the provincial government to forward a telegram to the central government, clearly ordering the deployment of troops from all over the country to fight. (3) Telegraph all military personnel and people's groups across the country to inspire great conscience and rise up to save the country. Furthermore, the entire committee of the Changsha Municipal Party Headquarters, including Liu Wonan, issued a public telegram on the 6th, saying that because the violent Japan is wreaking havoc, the party has no way to save the country from danger, so it has voluntarily requested to be relieved of their duties to avoid occupying positions and being ridiculed. This also shows their grief and indignation. He Jian, chairman of the provincial government, also sent two telegrams, one asking Zhang Xueliang not to hesitate to sacrifice himself and supervise the troops to kill the enemy, and the other asking the generals of Sichuan and Guizhou to stop fighting and resist aggression. The telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>(To Zhang Xueliang in Beiping) Director Zhang Han'gong, I was shocked and saddened to hear the news of the loss of Yuguan. The Japanese wolf has a vicious ambition to annex North China, and you are in charge of the key to the eastern gate. How could you not hear the news of the war and give such an important place to the enemy? I urge you not to hesitate to sacrifice yourself, supervise the troops and kill the enemy, have the determination to save the city, and come up with a plan to sink the boat and break the cauldron. Every inch of land is precious, and your reputation will be even greater. I am not talented, but I vow to lead the people of the three Xiang regions, sleep on our weapons and be vigilant, and provide you with support. Looking north at the smoke and dust, my heart aches. Please understand my stupid words and give me your kind words. He Jian kowtows and sings.</p>
<p>(To the generals of Sichuan and Guizhou) Sichuan Chairman Liu Zigan, Director Liu Fu Cheng, Guizhou Commander Mao Qunlin, Chairman You Yongnong, and Army Commander Wang Shaowu, I was shocked and saddened to hear the news of the loss of Yuguan. The gate has been opened, and Pingjin is shaking. The fate of the country and the nation depends on a moment. If we can unite to resist aggression at this time, there may be something we can do. If disaster is imminent, and the wall has not been removed, let me ask, if the country is no longer a country, what else is there? All of you have shown your loyalty and righteousness, and the world admires you. I know you must feel the same grief and indignation when you hear this bad news. I hope you will resolve all misunderstandings and stop the fighting immediately. Put the rights and wrongs to a public discussion, and go one step further, using the remaining bravery to attack the enemy. Achieve a deep friendship like Geng and Lin, and save the Zhao kingdom. I am incompetent, but I vow to lead the people of the three Xiang regions, walk in the dust, and fight against the violent Japan. With tears in my eyes, I submit my words. Please give me your instructions. Younger brother He Jian kowtows and sings. (January 7)</p>

<h3>Negotiation Progress Regarding the Matsui Incident</h3>
<p>Matsui Leads Mongol Bandits to Attack Kailu</p>
<p>Captured Prisoner Confesses to Being Shot Dead in the Chaotic Army</p>
<p>Hashimoto Sends Telegram to Thank for Collecting Ashes</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Japanese militarists instigate the independence of Inner Mongolia, intending to unite Inner and Outer Mongolia and organize a so-called puppet Great Yuan State. The conspiracy documents have been revealed in newspapers. Now, we continue to find the documents of Yongatsu, the military attaché of the Japanese Army Representative Embassy in Beiping, negotiating with our Rehe authorities after the main culprit of the case, Colonel Kiyosuke Matsui, was killed. These documents are of utmost importance, so we will disclose them in their original form as follows: (1) On March 2nd, the Rehe military authorities received a letter from Yongatsu, the military attaché of the Japanese Army Representative Embassy in Beiping, forwarded by Huang Jinbiao, the director of the Beiping office, stating that Cui Xinwu, the brigade commander of the Ninth Cavalry Brigade of Rehe, and the special detachment, broke the agreement with Captain Hayama of the Japanese army stationed in Tongliao, and attacked the Mongolian Autonomous Army in the northeast of Kailu on February 25th, cruelly executing Kiyosuke Matsui, a Japanese army colonel who was the instructor of the army. The Japanese military headquarters expressed extreme regret for this action by the Rehe army. It was found that the Mongolian Autonomous Army still did not attack the Rehe army, and only acted in the Mongolian area north of the Xilamulun River (excluding Kailu and Linxi counties). Regarding this case, the Japanese military headquarters hopes to show sincerity, discuss solutions, and quickly reply to the representative military attaché Yongatsu, etc.</p>
<p>(2) On March 5th, the Rehe Army Headquarters telegraphed Huang, the director of the Beiping office, instructing him to go to the Japanese Embassy and question Military Attaché Yongatsu about where Matsui was killed and under what circumstances, urging him to reply quickly and report the negotiation situation at any time.</p>
<p>(3) On March 7th, Huang Jinbiao, the director of the Rehe Army in Beiping, reported the negotiation situation to the Rehe Army Headquarters as follows: (1) According to Yongatsu, Hayama, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tongliao, wanted to allow the Mongolian army to pass through the border area of Kailu and Linxi, and invited Colonel Matsui to go with him. Biao immediately asked what the purpose of passing through Kailu and Linxi was. Yongatsu replied that it was a security operation, and said that Japanese Captain Hayama had already negotiated the passage with Brigade Commander Cui stationed in Kailu. Biao then questioned Yongatsu whether there were supporting documents or only verbal conversations. Yongatsu replied that he did not know. Yongatsu continued that when the Mongolian army arrived near Kailu, Brigade Commander Cui suddenly attacked the Mongolian army about twenty miles northeast of Kailu and killed Colonel Matsui. Biao immediately refuted Yongatsu, stating that the Mongolian army was not a formal army, but bandits disturbing local security, and that Colonel Matsui would not participate in such inferior bandits. Chairman Bi of the Rehe Army has not received a report from Brigade Commander Cui, and the truth will be discussed again. Yongatsu stated that as long as the Chinese side apologizes, the matter can be concluded and should not be delayed to avoid accidents. Biao stated that since the truth is not clear, there is no need or possibility to apologize. (2) Yongatsu also stated that he still intends to continue the previous discussions near Tongliao and proceed to the border near Kailu and Linxi. (4) On March 16th, the Rehe Army Headquarters telegraphed Brigade Commander Cui, asking whether there was a formal written contract for the operation of killing the Mongolian instructor Matsui. Since there were thousands of Mongol bandits attacking at the same time, how many casualties were there? Was Matsui's body only shot, or were there other injuries? It should be properly preserved, and the relics should also be properly stored as a basis for future negotiations. You should quickly reply in detail by telegram, and then negotiate with the Japanese side less, and do not use formal documents to avoid leaving any excuse. (5) On March 18th, Brigade Commander Cui telegraphed the headquarters, stating that the Japanese Matsui led more than 2,000 Mongolian troops westward, and Li's regiment repelled them, killing Matsui and more than 60 Mongolian soldiers. The entire process of blocking the attack has been reported by telegram. The bodies of Matsui and the Mongolian soldiers have been cremated by the local people, but Matsui's body has been photographed, and its bones are now being preserved. The documents and evidence obtained were previously brought to Rehe by Li, the leader of the special detachment. The brigade commander has not yet negotiated with the other party.</p>
<p>(6) On April 4th, the Rehe Headquarters sent a letter to Military Attaché Yongatsu, stating that Rehe Province has been making every effort to protect officials and civilians of your country, and there has been no lack of care. Unexpectedly, on February 25th, Brigade Commander Cui killed Matsui among the Mongol bandits in the defense zone. Afterwards, it was learned that Matsui was among them. According to the captured Mongol bandit Chaggan Buhe, during the fierce battle, we had more than a hundred casualties, and the crowd retreated. Matsui ordered a counterattack, but the crowd did not listen. Matsui opened fire to stop them, which aroused public outrage. The crowd opened fire and shot randomly. At that time, Matsui was shot and fell to the ground, and everyone took the opportunity to disperse. I was injured in my right side and could not move, so I was brought here. The brigade commander originally knew Matsui in Linxi, and immediately ordered to search for him among the corpses of the Mongol bandits. His head was found to have a penetrating gunshot wound, and he had already died. Diaries and other items were also obtained. Fearing that the body would rot in the heat, a photo was taken first, and then, according to Japanese customs, it was cremated and the ashes were properly preserved for his family to retrieve in the future. It is thought that Mongol bandits commit all kinds of atrocities, invading Kailu and disturbing our defense zone. The brigade commander was ordered to defend the territory and had the special responsibility of suppressing bandits. Matsui was a Japanese colonel who commanded Mongol bandits, which is quite inappropriate. It should be requested that your department negotiate with the Japanese authorities based on reason, and that such incidents should not happen again. It is believed that Brigade Commander Cui's suppression of bandits in the province is purely legitimate defense. Matsui aided the Mongol bandits in disturbing our defense zone, which is deeply regrettable. As for his being shot and killed, it was his own fault, and the Chinese side is even more unable to take responsibility. Following the previous cause, the situation is truthfully reported, and I would like to ask your military attaché to convey our regards to the authorities for their consideration, and hope that you will prevent such incidents from happening again in the future, so as to strengthen our good relations.</p>
<p>(7) On June 5th, the Rehe Headquarters received a telegram from Shao Zifeng, a senator, stating that:</p>
<p>The other party firmly requests to transport Matsui's remains to Beipiao.</p>
<p>(8) On June 21st, the Rehe Headquarters telegraphed Senator Shao, stating that according to Brigade Commander Cui's telegram, the official sent the adjutant of this headquarters, Ju Bingjun, to escort Matsui's remains to Beipiao on the day of respect. The senator should follow this order.</p>
<p>(9) On July 4th, a telegram was received from Hashimoto, the chief of staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, stating that Matsui's ashes were escorted to Beipiao by the noble commander's representative and handed over to our representative Ishimoto. Thank you very much for your kindness. (Shenshi News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Northeast Problem and the League of Nations (10) (1)</h3>
<h3>Representative Gu's Righteous and Stern Words</h3>
<p>Dr. Gu Weijun, the representative of our country, rose and said, "It is now late, and the points raised by the Japanese representative are numerous, and it may take me a long time to respond to each of them in detail. I respectfully ask the chairman to allow me to make a more detailed reply at the next meeting. However, regarding some of the Japanese representative's points, please allow me to briefly state the Chinese side's views at this time, which will take no more than ten to fifteen minutes. I hope the members of the Administrative Yuan will consider this. The opinions expressed by the Japanese representative are very detailed and comprehensive. Now, I will only briefly respond to two or three of them. First, the Japanese representative denied what I said yesterday about Japan's continental policy, and claimed that Japan loves peace and is the best in the world. They even said that what Japan gives is more than what Japan takes. Gentlemen, you must still remember what I said yesterday. At this time, I only need to mention a few place names to aid your memory, such as the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria, Mongolia, and now Rehe, etc. The Japanese representative also mentioned these territories. Who currently occupies them? The Japanese representative also tried hard to argue that the so-called Tanaka Memorial was forged, and made statements about Prime Minister Tanaka's itinerary, the biography of Director Fukushima's eldest daughter, and her age. However, regardless of whether the memorial is genuine or forged, the most important part of it was not mentioned by the Japanese representative. What is this most important part? It is the point about the necessity of Japan occupying Manchuria or Mongolia to create a leading position in North China and East Asia. For the past few decades, Japanese policy has been based on this backbone, but the Japanese representative denied that the so-called Tanaka's active policy was created and developed by the Tanaka Memorial. Page 41 of the Investigation Committee's report states, "The Tanaka Cabinet's active policy attaches great importance to the necessity of not treating Manchuria and other parts of China in the same way." From this, we can know the reason for the current situation in the three eastern provinces and Japan's efforts to isolate the three eastern provinces from the Chinese mainland. The report also states, "Japan has frankly stated that if turmoil affects Manchuria and Mongolia, affecting its security and endangering our special position and interests in the region (the above text is the same as that used in the Tanaka Memorial), Japan will rise up to protect it, regardless of where the threat originates." The Investigation Committee also expressed its opinion, "The Tanaka policy clearly states that Japan is responsible for maintaining security in Manchuria, which is different from the previous policy that only aimed to protect Japanese interests." We should also remember that Prime Minister Tanaka was the one who sent troops to China in 1927 and 1928 to hinder the work of the victorious army of the National Revolution to unify China. The facts that are revealed to us are much more powerful than verbal arguments, and I don't need to repeat them. I would also like to tell the members of the Administrative Yuan that even if the Tanaka Memorial is indeed forged, it must be a masterpiece by the Japanese. Chinese people will never be able to see the policies that modern Japan has enshrined as the norm in such a broad, comprehensive, detailed way. From China's position, it is convinced of the reasons for the authenticity of this memorial. Since 1905, for 27 years, Japan has repeatedly stated that China had made an agreement allowing Japan not to build a railway line parallel to the South Manchuria Railway. This year, Japan still has a semi-official document issued from Tokyo, stating that China and Japan have concluded 16 secret treaties, while the Chinese side completely denies this matter. So, does this secret treaty really exist? China has never recognized this agreement, but as far as I know, Japan notified European and American countries a few years ago, claiming that Japan opposes China's railway construction plan in the three eastern provinces, and that British, American and other countries' banking groups must not implement this plan, because China has this treaty obligation to fulfill. Regarding this point, we can find out the truth by looking at the words of the Investigation Committee. The report says, "We can now declare that the so-called promise of the Chinese plenipotentiaries attending the Beijing Conference between November and December 1905 regarding the parallel railway is not recorded in any formal treaty. However, this so-called promise is recorded in the minutes of the 11th day of the Beijing Conference on November 4, 1905. We have also obtained the agreement of the Japanese and Chinese representatives participating in this investigation team to acknowledge that there are no other documents containing this promise other than what is recorded in the Beijing Conference minutes." The above is just one point. Now, please allow me to present another point for you. Members of the Administrative Yuan, do you still remember when Japan suddenly submitted the Twenty-One Demands to the Chinese government in 1915 like a bolt from the blue? When European and American countries heard about it, they formally raised questions, but the Japanese government denied it, arguing that the Twenty-One Demands were non-existent and were completely alarmist words from China. Later, the governments of European and American countries received the full text of the Twenty-One Demands and inquired in Tokyo again, but Japan still firmly denied it. Japan made threats to China when submitting the Twenty-One Demands, demanding strict confidentiality and not leaking them to other countries, otherwise all consequences would be borne by the Chinese government. However, the European and American countries did not know how they obtained the full text of the Twenty-One Demands. Imagine what the Japanese diplomatic representatives in Europe and America would do at that time? They had no choice but to ask Tokyo for instructions. When the instructions arrived two or three days later, they claimed that only 11 of the so-called Twenty-One Demands were actually demands, and the remaining articles were only what the Japanese government hoped the Chinese government would consider. However, upon closer inspection of their content, they were actually of a demanding nature. After the Chinese government's experience with the above, once it sees the contents of the Tanaka Memorial, whether it is genuine or forged, how can it not feel extremely uneasy? I only have one comment on this, that is, what Japan did a few years ago is no different from what it is doing today. There is another point in the Japanese representative's statement that he hopes to convince me, that is, his so-called economic severance is a disguised form of war. The Japanese representative claimed that economic severance is as evil as war, or even worse than war. The Japanese representative is referring to the three eastern provinces. However, in China's view, since the three eastern provinces have been forcibly occupied by Japan and separated from China, economic severance is undoubtedly a peaceful self-defense strategy. Mr. Matsuoka gave a long description of the so-called Chinese xenophobia and its terrible consequences, and claimed that 15 million Chinese youths will not know where they are going in the future, and the threat to the world will be enormous. I have already explained to you yesterday that China does not have xenophobic ideas, and there is no need to repeat it here. Please refer to what I said yesterday. As for the request that the League of Nations Administrative Council find a way to solve this problem, we believe that after the Japanese army withdraws from the three eastern provinces and the threat to peace in the Far East is eliminated, the League of Nations will still have plenty of time to discuss it. Mr. Matsuoka also made statements about the current situation in China, and mentioned the Sino-Russian Treaty of 1898. The conclusion of this treaty was after the Sino-Japanese War, the Sino-Japanese War was the Korean War, which was created by Mutsu Munemitsu at the most opportune time. Mutsu issued an order to the Japanese envoy stationed in Seoul, saying, "Do not hesitate to use any excuse to take active action." You should still remember that what China hoped to be forcibly taken away by Japan could still be returned to China, so it concluded the Sino-Russian Treaty with Russia. Mr. Matsuoka expressed his displeasure with the joint intervention of Russia, Germany, and France against Japan. In fact, from our perspective, this matter is very reasonable. If the three countries could still help us with the three eastern provinces, then the three eastern provinces would still be Chinese territory, and there would be no Manchurian problem today. The Japanese representative also raised a point, hoping to convince the members of the Administrative Yuan, that is, Japan sincerely wants to help the Chinese people, and Japan sincerely wants to see China's unification. However, Japan's plan to help China's unification is the military action in Shanghai, the bombing of unarmed towns, and the occupation of Chinese territory that is wider than Germany and France. Even today, the Japanese army is still fighting against the Chinese people who oppose the puppet organization. If this is to help China's unification, then I would like to say to the Japanese representative, China does not welcome Japan's help. We cannot achieve the union of a family by robbing one of its members. We cannot achieve the unification of China by separating the most fertile part of China's territory. In other words, the picture drawn by the Japanese representative is very different from the facts. What are the facts? The Investigation Committee's report has them all, and there is no need to repeat them. As for other important issues, it is too late now, and I will present them to you at the next meeting."

<h3>Liu Xiang Expresses His Determination to Fundamentally Eliminate Liu Wenhui</h3>
<p>After the Neijiang Conference, Three Routes Attack Jiaren</p>
<p>Daily Military Expenditure Exceeds 300,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Looting Exceeds 100 Million Since the Outbreak of War</p>
<p>Inducing Guizhou Troops into Sichuan to Expand the War</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: After Liu Xiang, Yang Sen, and others held a meeting in Neijiang, which closed without satisfactory results, the depressed Sichuan situation has become tense again. On the 6th, Liu Xiang mobilized the entire army from Zigong, dividing it into three routes to advance on Liu Wenhui's army. The first route was the First Division, led by Division Commander Tang Shizun, leading ten regiments to attack Meishan. The second route was the Fourth Division, led by Division Commander Fan Shaozeng, leading twelve regiments to cross the river from Weiyuan and attack Jiading. The third route was the Teaching Division, led by Division Commander Pan Wenhua, leading ten regiments to attack Jingyan. The Second Division, led by Division Commander Wang Zanxu, was in the middle to respond, with a force of thirteen regiments. Liu Xiang led fifteen regiments of troops to oversee the battle. In the Renshou area, Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou's troops were responsible. The attack was launched on the morning of the 7th. The Chongqing army, both land and air, advanced together, and fierce battles took place in Mataping, Jingyan, and Qianfosi in Jiading. Liu Xiang's planes fiercely dropped bombs on the positions, killing many soldiers of Liu Wenhui's army and civilians in the war zone. The deaths on both sides were more than 3,000, and the front lines have not changed. Liu Xiang also urgently transferred the machine gun four regiment, two artillery regiments, and four planes from the rear to the front lines to launch a full-scale attack. According to Liu Xiang, he will not stop fighting until Liu Wenhui's army is fundamentally eliminated, and he said that there is no hope of unifying the Sichuan situation without completely resolving Liu Wenhui. He also declared to his troops that as long as the 24th Army is defeated, the 21st Army can dominate Sichuan. The armies were convinced without being intimidated. After unifying Sichuan, they will invade Guizhou, and all the generals have high hopes. Therefore, all the generals are willing to die for him. Liu Xiang also rewarded the soldiers with heavy money to encourage morale. However, the war has been prolonged and unresolved, and the army's finances are very alarming. The grain taxes in various counties in the garrison area have been collected until the 51st year of the Republic of China. Temporary military expenses have been levied five or six times. In addition, the market is sluggish, business is not prosperous, and tax revenue has decreased, making it more difficult to support the war. A day of combat costs 300,000 yuan. Liu Xiang has no way to cope, and is now issuing grain credit tax coupons on a large scale, forcing them to circulate in the market. They have been issued thirteen times, each time for 3 million, totaling 39 million. There are no reserve funds, and the situation is precarious. The Chongqing banks that Liu Xiang has forced to borrow from include Ju Xingcheng Bank for 1 million, Chuan Kang Zhili Bank for 500,000, Bank of China for 2 million, Meifeng Bank for 1 million, Pingmin Bank for 500,000, Shimin Bank for 500,000, Yanyue Bank for 1 million, and Commercial Bank for 500,000, totaling more than 7 million. Other money shops and large merchants have also borrowed money. The total amount of debt owed by Liu Xiang's army is now more than 80 million, plus the grain credit tax coupons issued without funds, totaling more than 110 million. Each day the war is prolonged, Liu Xiang's army owes 300,000 more in debt. Therefore, Liu Xiang is eager to resolve the war. However, the allied forces have undergone changes. Yang Sen, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and others are dissatisfied because Liu Xiang controls the counties in the defense area obtained from Liu Wenhui's army and monopolizes the salt funds from Zigong. They are unwilling to attack Liu Wenhui's army again. Liu Wenhui calmly dealt with Liu Xiang, defended the Tonghe Minjiang area, deployed heavy troops, and built solid fortifications as a long-term plan. The Chongqing army could not advance, resulting in the prolongation of the war. Therefore, Liu Xiang had to change his plan and sent a representative Lin to Kunming, Yunnan, to invite Guizhou troops to send troops, promising them common benefits, and helping Mao Guangyi to settle the Guizhou situation and resolve Wang Jialie, prompting Mao to send troops to help attack Liu Wenhui. According to Lin's telegram from Kunming, Long Yun has agreed and decided to send troops to help. In recent days, Guizhou troops have been found in the Huili area of southern Sichuan, totaling three regiments. However, they are stationed in Huili and have not yet advanced. Liu Wenhui telegraphed Guangdong, requesting them to stop the Guizhou troops from entering Sichuan, otherwise there would be no day of destruction. At the same time, he telegraphed Long Yun, inquiring about the truth of sending troops into Sichuan, and asked Long to clearly express his attitude. Long has not yet replied by telegram. As for the Guizhou army, now that the Guizhou situation has been roughly stabilized, the troops of Hou Zhidan, the commander of the Fourth Division, have surrounded Liu Wenhui's army in Jiading from the seven counties of southern Sichuan. It is reported that the battle is quite fierce. Mao Guangyi sent Jiang Zaizhen to lead four regiments into Sichuan to help Liu Xiang, hoping that Liu would help him settle the Guizhou situation. However, the 70 million people in Sichuan are still trying to stop the Sichuan military civil war, while Guizhou and Guizhou have entered Sichuan again, fueling internal strife, and the people will suffer even more. They unanimously telegraphed their resistance and asked the central government to seriously stop it, but the effect is not easy to judge. (8th)</p>
<h3>The Qiongya Communist Bandits Will Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>The Defense Army Uses the Miao People as Guides</p>
<p>Bandit Leader Wang Wenyu Has Been Captured Alive</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since Chen Jitang sent troops to recover Qiongya, he also abolished the Qiongya Special Zone. Chen Zhangfu was appointed as the director of the Qiongya Pacification Office, and the pacification work began. The suppression of the Communists is also progressing steadily. Qiongya has always been far from the provincial capital and close to the sea, and the Communist bandits have been using it as a nest for a long time. In recent years, the bandit forces have been quite large, and the pseudo-army has expanded to more than ten regiments, with Wang Wenyu, the pseudo-independent second division commander, in charge of everything. As a result, the trails of bandits are all over Qiongya. Recently, the Guard Brigade of the Defense Army has been specifically responsible for the search and suppression, and the bandit army has suffered casualties of seventy-eight percent. Only the bandit leader Wang Wenyu escaped into the mountains. In order to thoroughly eliminate the people, the Guard Brigade used the Miao people as guides and sent troops deep into the mountains to search. On the 2nd of this month, they captured the remaining fleeing bandits in Dajiliaoshan in the southeast of Yangjiang, Lehui County. The bandit leader Wang Wenyu was also arrested. Chen Hanguang, the brigade commander of the Guard Brigade, telegraphed from Yangjiang on the 3rd, reporting urgently that Wang Wenyu, the pseudo-division commander of the Communist bandits, was captured alive by the officers of this brigade in the forest of Dajiliaoshan in the southeast of Yangjiang, Lehui County, at noon on the 2nd. A pistol, forty bullets, a jade seal with the inscription "Headquarters of the Second Independent Division of the Pseudo-Chinese Red Army", a private seal of Wang Wenyu, two watches, a compass, a map, 32 yuan of central banknotes, and a fountain pen were seized. There were no other bandits with him. According to Wang, the entire Red Army in Qiongya has been completely wiped out, and only a few bandit leaders, such as Feng Fuquan and Nai Zheng, remain. Wang was sent to the Haikou Pacification Office for processing on the morning of the 3rd. In the past few days, Mo Battalion of the First Regiment killed a pseudo-division armory director in Shigungshan, seizing a gun and 22 bullets. Tang Battalion killed several bandits and captured more than ten bandits. Guan Ruishan has ordered Liu and Peng's regiments and the Miao people's vanguard to suppress them day and night, killing eight bandits, capturing nine male and female bandits, and seizing a Guangdong-made 79 rifle.

<h3>Jiangsong Raises Funds to Dredge Huxi River</h3>
<p>The river channel starting from the Qiaonan Pier of the road outside the West Gate of this city, named Hushi River, is recorded in the local chronicles. To the south, it stretches to the Guyang Bridge Zhanran Nunnery, and is the source of drinking water for nearby residents, and the source of irrigation for hundreds of acres of paddy fields in that area. Recently, it has not been dredged for a long time and has become silted up. Surprisingly, someone was measuring the river last night, which surprised the people who saw it. After inquiry, it was learned that Gu Jue, the director of the Shentian Bureau, intends to sell the river, and a certain Han is willing to pay to take over it. The news spread, and the farmers were panicked. They asked Sun Shaochi, the town mayor of the area, to find a way to stop it. Sun went to the bureau to inquire, but did not get any clear information. Therefore, the town mayor convened a meeting and decided to submit a request to the Finance Department to instruct the bureau to stop it, and to send a letter to the county bureau to stop the progress. At the same time, they will find ways to raise funds for dredging. The expenses have been enthusiastically acknowledged by the residents of the area, and the Construction Bureau is requested to send someone to survey it, so as to achieve the purpose of preservation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Suspected Murder Case Exhumed for Examination</h3>
<p>Qian Yingen, a resident of Waikuatang Township, died after falling into the river last September. After the District Procuratorate completed its investigation, it decided not to prosecute. However, the deceased's family believed he had been beaten to death and appealed to the High Court for reconsideration. The High Court ordered the Wuxian District Procuratorate to exhume the body for a new examination. The court exhumed the body yesterday (the 10th) at an open space in Guanku Lane. After examination by the coroner and other officials, it was determined that there were no fatal injuries on the body. There was only a minor injury on the right hand, which was likely sustained when he fell into the river. The coroner immediately filled out the corpse identification form and awaited further investigation.</p>

A few days later, a robbery occurred at the home of Zhao Songping. County Magistrate Zhang investigated and found that the bandit had committed multiple robberies and other serious crimes in the past. The executed bandit Yu Chunyuan and others had confessed that Shang was the mastermind.

<h3>Zhenjiang Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Build Sluice Gates</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the Wang and Zhu Rivers are deeply connected to the water conservancy of the counties downstream of the Jiangbei region. Last year, the Labor Relief Bureau used labor-for-relief methods to straighten the two rivers. If sluice gates are not built in time to control the water flow, it will cause significant harm. Local organizations have repeatedly requested that funds be allocated for the construction of these gates. The provincial government believes that this should be approved immediately. Therefore, it ordered the Department of Construction to immediately withdraw 150,000 yuan in construction bonds from the road construction funds and hand them over to the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau for verification and reserve. Construction should begin immediately according to the original sluice gate construction plan.</p>
<h3>Reduction in Wheat Cake Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation believes that wheat cakes and bean cakes are essential items needed by farmers for agricultural production. In addition to fertilizing fields and feeding livestock, they are also necessities for poor people to make a living. The business tax should not be too high. They specially requested the Department of Finance to reduce or exempt the tax rate. Subsequently, the Department of Finance approved, stating that this year's low grain prices have harmed farmers, constituting a special circumstance that warrants appropriate relief. It approved a temporary collection of 2 per mille, according to the rice and flour industry tax rate, starting from the winter of the 21st year, to show compassion. The federation has already recorded the approval and sent letters to the various county chambers of commerce.</p>

Defenses along the rivers and coasts of the Jianghai region have been strengthened. Emergency precautions are also being taken in the inland areas to prevent unexpected incidents.</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of Liu Haisha's Opium Smuggling Case</h3>
<p>The opium trade in Nantong is very active, and opium traffickers are very active. To avoid detection, they often wrap the opium in oiled cloth and throw it into the shallows, then retrieve it when the opportunity arises. Zhou Er, a resident of Liu Haisha Township, recently retrieved 16 pieces of opium from the Yangtze River at Shierxu Port and divided them with others. The Public Security Bureau investigated and arrested Zhou, sending him to the county for thorough investigation.</p>

They then rushed into the house of Zhang Shucai across the street, looting extensively. As they left, they kidnapped Zhang's young son. The victim desperately chased after them and was shot and killed by the bandits. Afterwards, Zhang's family, Zhang Qishi, reported the incident to the county government. County Magistrate Wang specially dispatched Shen Cheng, accompanied by a coroner, to the township to investigate the scene.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Yongchuan Ship Robbed in Shipu Waters</h3>
<p>The Yongchuan ship of the Yongchuan Shipping Bureau on the north bank of Jiangbei, Ningbo, has been operating between Wenzhou and Ningbo for many years. At 5:00 PM on the 5th of this month, the ship departed from Ningbo for Wenzhou, carrying over 500 pieces of cargo and over 400 passengers. To prevent theft, the ship was equipped with five maritime police officers. At 6:00 AM on the 6th, the ship arrived at Shipu Wharf and unloaded cargo and passengers as usual. It then continued its journey. However, during the unloading of cargo and passengers, eight or nine Taiwanese bandits disguised as passengers boarded the ship. At about 7:00 AM, as the ship sailed through the Manshan waters, the bandits forced the ship to sail to Dasheng Island in Taizhou, more than 100 miles from Haimen. There, five more Taiwanese bandits boarded the ship and looted extensively. One water police officer, Jin Yun, two passengers, He Jinfa and Lian Gengsheng, three passengers, Xie Xinyuan, Xu Quanfa, and others, and the five Brownings and one wooden pistol carried by the maritime police team were all stolen by the bandits. Three young women among the passengers were raped and injured. In addition to the seven hundred yuan stolen from the purser's office, the clothing and silver of over 400 passengers were lost, estimated at over ten thousand yuan. After being robbed, the ship sailed from Haimen to Wenzhou on the evening of the 7th and should be returning today. After receiving a report from the Haimen branch bureau, the Ningbo bureau reported to the Maritime Police Bureau and relevant agencies, requesting investigation and pursuit.</p>
<h3>News from the Jinjiang Fritillaria Sales Cooperative</h3>
<p>Fritillaria is an important medicinal material, produced in the Zhangcun area of Yinjing Township, You County. Recently, the local farmers have realized that the quality of their products is declining and their livelihoods are difficult. To adapt to modern trends, they have initiated the organization of a cooperative to study cultivation and improve quality. All of the dried fritillaria produced next year will be centrally managed by the cooperative, which is automatically formed by the farmers. The sales volume will be limited, and sales will be made in batches. Based on social needs, an appropriate price will be set. It is heard that the planned sales volume is 500,000 catties per year, with a price starting at 100 yuan and increasing by 5 yuan each month, gradually increasing until supply and demand are balanced. Therefore, each household has decided to change from complex production to single production next spring. The various households have held many meetings and have submitted an application to the provincial and county governments for record, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Industry and Rural Cooperatives.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou County Magistrate Protects Mail Ships Along the Way</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government approved a letter from the Jiangsu-Anhui Postal Administration stating that mail is transported by mail ships to and from various inland locations, which is very important to public transportation. However, recently, mail ships in the counties of Dongtai, Xinghua, Wujin, Taixian, and Liyang have been frequently robbed, which has greatly impacted the future of mail delivery. The county government was specially instructed to strictly prevent water bandits and to pay special attention to protecting mail ships along the way. After receiving the order, the county government has ordered the Public Security Bureau and police teams to comply.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Aviation School Training Plane Accident</h3>
<p>A training plane from the Central Aviation School crashed about three miles from the school on the 10th, killing student Xie Zhongzhu and injuring instructor Li Junde. The accident occurred at 11:00 AM on the 10th. Li Junde, a major instructor in the aviation school's flight department, and student Xie Zhongzhu were flying together in a No. 3 training plane purchased from the United States. Li was piloting, and a foreign instructor and another student were flying in formation in a No. 12 training plane.

<h3>After the Resumption of Sino-Russian Relations, the Government Should Urgently Communicate Trade with Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>National Federation of Commerce Urges in Telegram Yesterday</p>
<p>丨 A Collection of Heavy Taxes Levied by the Kulun Government 丨</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry yesterday. The telegram read: "To the National Government Executive Yuan, Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry: We have received a letter from Li 　shan, Ren Yuheng, Cui 　yu, Cheng Fan'an, Wang 　ting, etc., representatives of the merchants and people of Chahar Province, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Outer Mongolia is Originally Part of National Territory</h3>
<p>It is an integral part of our country. Its vast area and abundant resources are almost the best among the provinces in the interior. In terms of politics, it can serve as our country's barrier. In terms of economy, it is enough to supply the people's livelihood. The people of Outer Mongolia are of the same nation as those in the country, and there is no separation in customs and habits. Moreover, there is a demand and supply relationship that cannot be separated. Therefore, there is a very long history of mutual benefit and coexistence. However, since the political reform of the Soviet Union, new trends have spread, and the thinking of the Mongolian people has changed. The young people are emotionally impulsive and easily agitated by the biases of socialism. Therefore, they changed their outward psychology and willingly accepted Soviet Russian protection. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, they organized a government in Ku Lun, intending to</p>
<h3>Break Away from Our Country's Suzerain Relationship</h3>
<p>From then on, the biggest change occurred in the political aspect between the interior of our country and Outer Mongolia. In terms of economy, trade between the interior and Outer Mongolia was also abruptly cut off. After the Sino-Russian negotiations on the Eastern Railway issue broke down, the weaker emotions of the Mongolian people showed further hatred for Chinese merchants. From then on, Chinese merchants in Ku Lun who were engaged in business and lived there were subjected to extremely harsh treatment. Not only was their property confiscated, and their human rights were trampled on, but they also had no freedom to enter, leave, or move, nor freedom to reside and do business. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese merchants in Ku Lun lived a miserable life, with each day feeling like a year. Their suffering and tragic situation are truly endless. Our government could not recover the lost Outer Mongolia, and it had no way to provide relief to the merchants living in Ku Lun, causing Zhangjiakou, which has the closest relationship with Outer Mongolia, to declare bankruptcy in all business matters. Now that</p>
<h3>China and Russia Have Resumed Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>We must quickly catch up and propose a rescue plan for negotiations with Russia. This is the first thing that should be carefully considered and planned. Furthermore, the commercial relationship between Zhangjiakou and Outer Mongolia has been at a standstill since the economic blockade of Outer Mongolia and the refusal of Chinese merchants to enter the country. The import of Mongolian goods has also stagnated at the same time. Both supply and demand have been greatly affected. The mutually beneficial relationship has turned into an antagonistic relationship for several years. However, after investigating the reasons, it is all because the emotions between China and Russia have not been reconciled, and the Mongolian people's perception of the interior is weak, leading them to express intimacy with Russia. This kind of fact can be stated by those familiar with the internal affairs of Outer Mongolia. Therefore, although the losses of Chinese merchants have reached 40 to 50 million yuan, the lack of material needs felt by the people of Outer Mongolia has also become a more serious situation. The key to this is whether China and Russia can understand each other. If China and Russia can truly restore friendly relations, our country's diplomatic authorities can naturally prescribe the right medicine and heal the gap between the interior and Outer Mongolia by</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union is Responsible for Peaceful Resolution</h3>
<p>Preserving the original friendly facts. The livelihood and national economy of the interior can obtain considerable gains. Outer Mongolia and the needs of a thriving population between China and Russia can also solve great difficulties. In a moment of transformation, several good things are achieved. This is the second thing that the government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs should set as a key condition for the first negotiations with Russia, to restore the mutually beneficial relationship between Zhangjiakou and the warehouse. Furthermore, our country's trade with Russia has always been backward. The goods that are shipped out are mainly soybeans from Manchuria, and the goods that are shipped out from Zhangjiakou are mostly silk and tea products, all of which are agricultural products. There are no industrial products for rotation. It is only used as raw materials for others, with no manufacturing capacity. In terms of capital, all are operated by private individuals with small capital, with no state-run or privately-run trading companies. Now, the economic policy of the Soviet Union is at its peak, and the five-year industrial plan is being implemented, with great results. With the capital of the country, it is confronting the capital of private individuals. Russian commerce will undoubtedly win. The development of our country's merchants' foreign trade may have no hope. Moreover, what we ship out are only a few kinds of raw materials, and what is rotated are mostly manufactured goods. The phenomenon of excess imports is unavoidable, and commercial competition is bound to fail. This is what should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Now, we will take the</p>
<h3>Two Key Points Within Our Limited Scope</h3>
<p>First, the state should encourage the organization of jointly funded trading companies (such as exempting foreign trade goods from increased taxes, reducing freight, and protecting safety, stipulating laws, and providing special protection). Second, the state should promote jointly funded construction of the Zhang-Ku or Zhang-Duo railways, and develop the resources of Inner Mongolia, and open factories for various industries in Zhangjiakou (such as leather manufacturing, woodworking, ironware, and various manufacturing factories). Only in this way can there be a possibility of confrontation with Soviet Russian commerce. Otherwise, it will only be a slave market. This is the third thing that the government should implement commercial protection policies after Zhangku. Turning to the above two points, both are most closely related to our country's economy and the people's livelihood. They are the most important conditions in the Sino-Russian negotiations for the establishment of mutually beneficial trade treaties. The third opinion is an indispensable facility for developing the national and social economy and protecting the national economy and the people's livelihood. The representatives saw the lurking dangers ahead and asked your association to submit the information accordingly. On the one hand, the strategy for commercial relations between China, Russia, and Outer Mongolia should be carefully planned and secretly stipulated. On the other hand, the policy of protecting merchants should be determined and promulgated. If you do not abandon the humble opinions and adopt them, then the merchants in Russia and Mongolia will have a prosperous life. The reason for the electric presentation to your government and ministries is to ask you to examine and approve and implement them, so as to benefit trade, to the utmost degree. The attached documents are presented. Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, bows, gray seal.</p>

The telegram read: "To Director Yan Xishan, Mr. Baichuan, Taiyuan: The fall of Yuguan means that Hebei will become the sequel to the Eastern Provinces. If Hebei is lost, our Jin's situation will become like Jehol today. Looking north at our homeland, we are extremely worried. In recent years, our country's territory has been shrinking day by day, first because of relying on the League of Nations, and second because of hoping for a lucky escape. Now that the enemy has penetrated deep, we cannot even achieve partial preservation without causing disaster. This is extremely painful. You, sir, are concerned about the times and the country, and you must have a way to save North China and protect our homeland. Once you engage with the violent Japanese, we hope that you will lead the Jin-Sui generals and vow to repay the country with your lives, so as to prolong the lifeline of our nation. Dubi is filled with grief and indignation and cannot control himself. I respectfully offer my thoughts and hope that you will consider them. Xue Dubi bows."</p>

<h3>Yesterday Was Not a Shanghai-Beiping Flight Day</h3>
<p>Heavy Wind and Snow Last Night</p>
<p>Difficult to Take Off This Morning</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Beiping route of China National Aviation Corporation has not taken off since it was blocked by heavy fog the day before yesterday. Because yesterday was not a flight day (the northbound days are Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday), it still did not take off. The first flight will begin this morning. However, yesterday afternoon, the wind suddenly picked up, and snow fell in the evening. It is feared that it will not be able to take off again this morning. The westbound plane on the Shanghai-Hankou line was blocked by fog the day before yesterday and had to return four times. At 8:15 AM yesterday morning, pilot Gist still flew the No. 6 plane westward. The eastbound plane was blocked in Nanjing the day before yesterday, and it did not leave Beijing eastward until 7:50 AM yesterday morning, arriving in Shanghai at 9:50 AM. From this, it can be seen that the heavy fog the day before yesterday was only in the Beijing-Shanghai area. Yesterday, there was rain and no fog in Shanghai, and the plane could still take off. However, there was heavy fog above Hankou, causing the company's Chongqing-Hankou route, piloted by pilot Ge Fu in the No. 5 plane, to take off westward at 8:10 AM yesterday morning, but it had to return to Hankou at 9:40 AM.</p>

By midnight, the weather suddenly changed, and the sound of rain continued all night. By yesterday morning, the temperature had dropped sharply, and the wind was very strong. Light rain was misty, and cold and dampness were combined. According to those who have lived in the north, this kind of weather sometimes occurs in late autumn and early winter. By about 9:00 PM, the wind was even stronger, snow fell from the sky, and the temperature also dropped, which was completely different from the day before yesterday.</p>

Hereafter, customs ships will adopt the internationally recognized signal, consisting of one short sound, one long sound, and then two short sounds. This signal indicates 'stop ahead' and signifies that there is an important message to convey. All customs ships, regardless of the reason for requiring steam or sailing vessels to stop ahead, will use this signal. Please take note."</p>
<h3>Geng Jizhou Asks Rear Support Association for Assistance</h3>
<p>Liu Ying, the left-wing commander of the 4th Route Army of the Liaoning Volunteer Army headquarters, presented a letter yesterday from Geng Jizhou, the commander-in-chief of the 4th Route Army, to the Northeast Volunteer Army Rear Support Association, personally requesting substantial aid. The letter stated: "To Whom It May Concern, unfortunately, our China suffers, and the plight of the three provinces remains unresolved while the situation in Yuyu-Rehe is becoming increasingly critical. The National Army fought bloodily for three days and nights, but Yuguan finally fell. Our army is stationed along the Liaoxi-Rehe border, and our soldiers are prepared to die. However, due to a lack of ammunition, we are unable to engage in direct warfare. I, Jizhou, am inadequate and can only order my troops to harass the enemy's rear, causing them to worry about their rear. This prevents them from advancing rapidly. Liu Ying, the left-wing commander of our army, is currently delayed in Shanghai due to official duties. Given the urgency of the situation at the front, I, Jizhou, have ordered him to return to the defense immediately. We respectfully request that your esteemed association, based on its principle of caring for the Volunteer Army, immediately provide our army with substantial assistance and allocate a certain amount of funds in advance, which can be handed over to Liu Ying. This will allow him to purchase medicines and other supplies upon his return to the unit to meet urgent needs. Our soldiers will not fail the earnest expectations of our compatriots in the rear and vow to protect our territory with iron blood. Even if we have only one soldier and one bullet left, we will fight to the death. We earnestly request that your esteemed association grant our request to facilitate the killing of the enemy and constantly provide us with guidance so that I, Jizhou, may have something to follow."</p>

<p>Yesterday's Meeting of the Four-County Committee</p>
<p>Resolved on Methods for Project Funding</p>
<p>Dong Xiujia, director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, recognizing the importance of water conservancy in the province, specially established the Jiangsu Provincial Labor Conscription and River Dredging Committee. Because the river channels at the Liuhuo estuary have not been dredged for a long time, and have become even more silted up since the outbreak of hostilities on January 28, making navigation difficult, dredging is urgently needed. Zhu Kaiqiao and Cai Wangzhi were specially appointed as members of the Provincial Labor Conscription Committee and as the director and deputy director of the Liuhuo Branch, respectively. In addition, Wu Sheng-san, Zhu Menghao, Gu Jiqing, Pan Zhixing, Jin Jushan, Gu Zhenyi, and other local gentry from Taicang, Kunshan, Jiading, and Baoshan counties were appointed as members of the Liuhuo Branch. The county magistrates and construction bureau chiefs of the four counties of Taicang, Kunshan, Jiading, and Baoshan are ex officio members. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, Zhu Kaiqiao, the director of the committee, held the first committee meeting at 20 Renji Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. The county magistrates and construction bureau chiefs of the four counties, as well as the committee members, attended. Zhu Kaiqiao chaired the meeting. (1) Project Allocation: Resolved to allocate the project according to the existing plan of twelve shares: Kunshan's first project receives 2/12 shares, Taicang's second project receives 6.4/12 shares, Jiading's third project receives 2.4/12 shares, and Baoshan's fourth project receives 1.2/12 shares (However, the area of Baoshan that has been changed and incorporated into the city will be handled by the Department of Construction in consultation with the municipal government). (2) Project Funding Budget: Resolved to compile a detailed budget in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Construction for the meeting to decide. (3) Project Implementation Procedure: Resolved to build a dam on the 27th of this month, close the dam on February 6, release water on the 7th, hand over the river on the 17th, start digging on the 18th, and complete the work and open the dam on March 18.

The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Pilots' Association Requests Registration</h3>
<p>Shanghai dispatch from the Shishi News Agency: For decades, our country's piloting rights have been held by foreigners. Last year, our navigation industry strongly advocated for their recovery. The Ministry of Navy even established a pilot training school to nurture pilot talent and gradually prepare for their recovery. The Yangtze River, being our inland river, also employs foreign pilots due to treaty relations. Currently, there are 25 Europeans and Americans and 20 Japanese. Our national defense is entirely in the hands of foreigners. Therefore, our country's Yangtze River pilots have specially organized the Songhu Pilots' Association to petition the Ministry of Navy for registration and the issuance of a business license as a first step toward recovering Yangtze River piloting rights. Yesterday, they specifically notified all domestic pilots to register with the association and sent a letter to the Navigation Association stating that, starting in January of this year, all Chinese Yangtze River ships requiring pilots should only hire domestic pilots and should no longer use foreign personnel. They also reported to the central government, requesting that the number of foreign pilots be restricted and reduced annually, and that their terms of service be shortened.</p>
<h3>Hydrographic Office to Measure Oriental Great Port on Behalf</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Regarding the matter of developing an Oriental Great Port, the Preparatory Committee for the Oriental Great Port has been conducting surveys of port sites separately and actively proceeding. Because the seabed depth changes rapidly, the committee has proposed conducting surveys once a year and has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways to allocate funds for implementation. It is reported that the authorities of the Ministry of Finance, due to financial difficulties, are unable to allocate funds immediately. In order to implement the survey as soon as possible, they consulted with the Ministry of Navy and requested the Hydrographic Office to conduct the survey on their behalf every year. Therefore, the Hydrographic Office received Instruction No. 7835 from the Ministry of Navy the other day and immediately prepared a list of the required survey expenses for reporting. The original text of the joint consultation between the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways is recorded below: For the matter of consultation, it is based on the report from Chen , director of the Preparatory Committee for the Oriental Great Port: "We have examined the plan proposed by this committee for separately surveying port sites. In the plan, the marine survey should be conducted every March for four months, and preparations should be made to start the actual measurement at the end of this year. However, although this committee's budget has been ordered to be restored, it only covers surveys of water and landforms. Surveys of seabed depth are not included in the budget, and the steamships and instruments needed for marine surveys have not yet been purchased, and the cost of temporary expenses is also very large. Even if it can be received immediately, it will still take time to purchase and prepare. The proposed measurement plan cannot be realized immediately. In order to coordinate both considerations, we propose that your ministry consult with the Ministry of Navy and instruct the Hydrographic Office to survey the depth of the seabed of Donggang once every March for about four months, so as to avoid delays in the planned measures. In addition, we should submit the request to the Executive Yuan to approve the addition of 56,820 yuan in temporary expenses for this year, so as to purchase supplements and carry out the marine survey. Is it feasible? We should prepare a temporary expense budget and submit it for review and instructions, and implement it separately." Checking the survey of bays and seabed depths is indeed the work that the committee should prepare for, but central finances are difficult, and it is feared that the Ministry of Finance will not be able to allocate the 56,820 yuan of temporary expenses at one time. This ministry also feels economically exhausted and cannot afford to cover the full amount. In order to implement the survey of Donggang seabed depths as soon as possible, we should consult with your esteemed ministry accordingly and hope that you will check and inquire whether the Hydrographic Office can survey the depth of the seabed of the Oriental Great Port on your behalf every year, how much funding is required, and please instruct to reply immediately so as to handle it. As for inter-departmental friendship, Gu Shishi, head of the General Affairs Section of the Hydrographic Office, told a Central News Agency reporter that the work on the port site of the Oriental Great Port will take about two years to complete. The northern great port is currently unable to proceed due to the severe weather in the north, so it has been rescheduled to April.</p>
<h3>Songhu Sea Traffic Restored</h3>
<p>Since a heavy fog occurred in Shanghai the day before yesterday, completely disrupting incoming and outgoing ships, sea traffic has also been suspended for more than 30 hours. Until yesterday morning, the fog in the Songkou waters dispersed, and the fog in the various ports of the Yangtze River also dissipated. The obstructed ships gradually entered the port, and the ships waiting to leave in Wusong also set sail. By yesterday afternoon, all ships obstructed by the fog had completely arrived in Shanghai. Songhu sea traffic was fully restored by yesterday noon.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association Sends Letters to Owners and Builders Urging the Use of Domestic Materials</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent letters to its member owners and rental agents yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, we have received a letter from the Chinese General Federation of Industry requesting the promotion of domestic cement and discussion of uniform tax regulations. This was resolved by the general meeting that all members of our industry should use domestic cement and other materials as the sole condition for construction, in order to fulfill our patriotic responsibility. We are responding with this letter, so please check and implement accordingly."</p>

<h3>Jiangwan Disaster Victims' Loan Measures</h3>
<p>Statistics on 850 Extremely Poor Disaster-Stricken Households</p>
<p>Loan Value Vouchers Being Distributed Successively</p>
<p>After the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, acting on the order of the Municipal Government, coordinated with the Public Security and Public Works Bureaus to handle relief matters in the Jiangwan District, a decision was made after several investigations and consultations, and was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. The bureau is now actively proceeding with it. A reporter from Riri News Agency learned about the progress of the handling as follows:</p>
<h3>Screening Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Previously, the bureau and others reported that there were 1,015 poor people reported by the municipal commissioners who were in urgent need of relief. After the bureau and others sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections of each household separately, more than 100 households who had already started building houses or whose burned houses still had more than one room were removed. It was estimated that 850 households should be provided with relief, of which 202 households would be provided relief by the local maintenance association, and the remaining 648 households would be handled by the municipal government through fundraising.</p>
<h3>Mapping Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>After screening, the number of disaster victims mapped is as follows: 52 households in Jieshi No. 14, 46 households in Jieshi No. 92, 18 households in Tui No. 7, 44 households in Tui No. 8, 7 households in Yin No. 4, 6 houses in Yin No. 5, 19 households in Yin No. 6, 53 households in Yin No. 9, 22 households in Yin No. 10, 21 households in Yin No. 11, 6 households in Yin No. 76, 52 households in Yin No. 77, 105 households in Yu No. 15, 42 households in Yu No. 25, 38 households in Yu No. 29, 29 households in Guan No. 5, 37 households in Guan No. 16, 39 households in Guan No. 92, and 12 households in Jian No. 30. The above totals 648 households. The 202 households handled by the local maintenance association include 37 households in Jian No. 28, 68 households in Jian No. 32, 15 households in Jian No. 35, 21 households in Yu No. 26, and 51 households in Yu No. 34.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Progress</h3>
<p>For the 648 households handled by the municipal government, with a loan of 150 yuan per household, 97,200 yuan is required. In addition to the original 28,000 yuan allocated to the district for housing construction loans by the Shanghai War Zone Rehabilitation Committee, the remaining 69,200 yuan has been raised by the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Loan Measures</h3>
<p>It has been decided to lend 150 yuan to each household to cover the needs of building a room, to be repaid in four years with no interest. The loan will be disbursed in three installments: 50 yuan per installment. For the second and third installments, cash will be disbursed, but the municipal commissioner must first verify the housing construction situation of the household, mark it clearly, and then issue it. In order to prevent misuse in the first phase, a 50-yuan value voucher will be issued. The voucher will be divided into five coupons, each worth 10 yuan. Two coupons can be exchanged for cash for turnover, and three coupons must be exchanged for wood and water materials to prevent misuse. Still fearing that the supply of materials in rural areas will not meet the demand and that merchants will take the opportunity to monopolize them, Chairman Zhang Xiaoliang of the Lumber Association has been asked to provide materials at a fair price. The first batch of vouchers has been distributed successively since January 5 and will be redeemed soon. It is also heard that after the loans are repaid in the future, the bureau plans to transfer them to expand the original poverty alleviation lending office, so that it can still be used to actively alleviate poverty.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks Stamp Tax Bureau to Determine Stamp Application Period</h3>
<p>Please Apply Stamps Starting from February 1</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau yesterday, stating: "To Whom It May Concern, on the 18th of this month, we received a letter from the Knitting Industry Association stating that we have received a letter from Jinghua Knitting Factory, a member of our association, stating that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce once announced that the closing period was the end of May and the end of September, and the end of January was the overall closing period. Businesses must change to new books every month after the overall closing period. We have received a reply from the Stamp Tax Bureau stating that if the aforementioned books are not exchanged for new books in January, stamps must be added to the old books, etc. It is difficult for the business community to change to new books before the overall closing period, and it is an unexpected burden to restamp books throughout the year, and there is no legal basis for it. We should transfer the request to determine the method, etc., and we have arrived at the Association. We have investigated that the closing date for the business community was changed last year to be held at the end of January of the following year by order of the Executive Yuan. The accounting year of the business community has been stipulated by the Yuan order, from February 1 of each year to the end of January of the following year. The period for adding new stamps to the books should also be based on this to connect with the year. Although the date is delayed by one month, there is no shortage of public tax revenue, and it is the result of complying with the Yuan's order and revising the date of the overall receipt. We should send a letter to your bureau to verify and reply, and transfer it to inspectors in each district to avoid misunderstandings. This is the purpose."</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Accuse the Stamp Tax Bureau of Partial Approval</h3>
<p>Various trade associations in this city, previously above the Shangbao Stamp Tax Branch Bureau Xu Zhicheng harassed merchants and people, specially convened a joint meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to discuss and submit a report to the various departments of the National Government, requesting dismissal and severe punishment. Now we have learned that the association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "We have received your submission. Checking and inspecting stamps is to promote affixing, and if the execution does not follow procedures, causing harassment, it should be strictly prohibited. We urgently need to strictly prohibit it. However, the Shangbao Stamp Tax Branch Bureau complained in the submission has been alleged to be disturbing the various sections, but it does not provide concrete statements of facts or submit evidence, and there is no basis for verification. Therefore, we will inform the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to supervise and handle the matter properly at any time." According to the reply, the association has recently received a lot of evidence from various trade associations regarding Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau chief, but will resubmit the case for verification after it has been fully collected.</p>
<h3>Customs Notice Revises Import Tariff on Tobacco Leaves</h3>

<h3>Korean Independence Party's Hong Xijun Sent Back for Sentence Execution</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years' Imprisonment</p>
<p>Hong Xijun, a Korean resident in Shanghai, was arrested on the 15th of last month by special police of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, on suspicion of joining the Korean Independence Party and engaging in anti-Japanese activities. Commissioners were sent by the Japanese military and political authorities to jointly interrogate him three times at the Consulate General. As a result, although Hong repeatedly denied joining the Korean Independence Party and undertaking anti-Japanese work, the Japanese authorities considered the evidence to be conclusive and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. According to news from the Japanese Consulate, Hong Xijun will be transported to a special prison set up by the Japanese in Korea on the afternoon of the 17th of this month, escorted by special police of the Japanese Consulate, aboard the Qing'an Maru, which will depart at 1:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>San You She Labor-Capital Dispute: National Government Orders Court Not to Accept Case</h3>
<p>To Be Handled by Revised Labor Dispute Law</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters Notifies Cotton Weavers' Union</p>
<p>The shutdown dispute at the San You Industrial Company in Pudong, Shanghai, was previously adjudicated by the Municipal Government in accordance with the law. However, the capital side refused to accept the ruling, causing delays for years without resolution. Subsequently, the Labor-Capital Dispute Handling Law was revised by the National Government and promulgated on September 27 of last year. According to the provisions of Article 7, Paragraph 1, of the law, neither the labor nor capital side may appeal the decision of the arbitration committee. Article 44, Paragraph 2, stipulates that disputes that occurred before the promulgation of the revised law but have not yet been resolved may be handled in accordance with this law. The labor side has therefore submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters to find a way to prevent the capital side from appealing and to enforce the adjudication, based on the above provisions. The Municipal Party Headquarters replied to the Seventh District Cotton Weavers' Union yesterday, stating: "For the purpose of informing, we have investigated that the request from the union to the Jiangsu High Court to expedite the hearing of the labor-capital dispute over the shutdown of the Shanghai factory of the San You Industrial Company has been forwarded to the central government by this committee and approved on file. Now, we have received Public Letter No. 2570 from the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee, stating that the Labor-Capital Dispute Handling Law was revised and promulgated by the National Government on September 27 of this year. The labor-capital dispute of the San You Industrial Company should be handled in accordance with the new law. In accordance with the approval above, in addition to forwarding a letter to the Secretariat of the Central Committee to forward a letter to the National Government, instructing the Judicial Yuan to instruct the Jiangsu High Court to issue a ruling in accordance with the law that the case will not be accepted by either the labor or capital side, and separately notifying the Shanghai Municipal Government for reference, we hereby inform you that you are instructed to handle it in accordance with the law." Standing Committee Members Pan Gongzhan, Tong Xingbai, and Wu Xingya.</p>
<h3>Wusong Steamer Dismisses Waiter: Dispute</h3>
<p>Party Headquarters Investigates Thoroughly</p>
<p>Da Gong News reports: Taikoo's Jianglu steamers previously caused a serious labor strike due to the dismissal of middle-class workers (i.e., waiters). After repeated mediation by party and government agencies, both sides signed a peace agreement to temporarily maintain the status quo and declare a resolution. Unexpectedly, at 9 p.m. the night before last, when the Wusong steamer was sailing, a fight broke out again because the compradore wanted to dismiss the waiter. Four workers, including Cao Yansheng, were injured. The waiters from each steamer yesterday pushed representatives to petition the party and government agencies. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent Zhu Guilin, and the Municipal Party Headquarters sent Dai Yongchan, to jointly investigate the truth of the incident at the Shipping Mutual Aid Association. According to the person in charge of the Shipping Association, the dismissal of the waiter was purely a company decision, and the business director was only carrying out company orders. The representatives of the party and government agencies stated that no other disputes should be started before the party and government mediate the case, and ordered the business director of the Wuhu steamer, Mao Dinghou, to be notified not to have similar incidents, and to wait for formal mediation according to law. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau, believing that the Wusong steamer waiter had boarded another steamer the night before to rush to Hankou to prepare to work on the steamer again in Hankou, was deeply afraid that the capitalist side of the steamer would still refuse to let him go, causing another incident, so they specially telegraphed the Hankou Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday to assist and allow the old waiter to disembark and serve when the Wusong steamer arrives in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Director of Savings and Remittances Bureau Rushes to Complete Handover</h3>
<p>Date of New Incumbent's Reception Undetermined</p>
<p>Yang Jianping, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, previously submitted a resignation to the Ministry, which was approved by Minister Zhu. It was approved at the 82nd Executive Yuan meeting the day before yesterday, and Tang Baoshu was appointed as his successor. It is learned that Director Yang ordered his subordinates yesterday to rush to complete the handover so that the new director can come to receive it. As for the date of reception, it has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Appoints Sun Xuexiu as Director of Two-Way Material Department</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways specially appointed Sun Xuexiu as Director of the Material Department of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways. Sun is scheduled to come to Shanghai to take office within days.</p>
<h3>Opposition Party Police Levy License Tax</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Branch Bureau collected tobacco and alcohol license taxes from the catering industry and tobacco paper shops in Zhabei, with four types of regulations: 2 yuan, 4 yuan, 8 yuan, and 16 yuan. Yili Firm and 40 other companies have delayed obtaining licenses and specially sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting them to instruct the respective jurisdictions to send police to assist in persuasion. However, Wei Langxuan Zhang Yimao and five other members of the 25th Branch of the Citizens' Federation, representing 72 merchants in Zhabei, submitted a petition to the Municipal Public Security Bureau stating: "This tobacco and alcohol license tax is contracted by merchants who seek to profit, enriching their own pockets. In the past 20 years, it was contracted by merchants Yang Bingyi and Gu and others. Moreover, the residents of Zhabei are exhausted after the disaster, and life is difficult to imagine. The road crossings in the area north of Sichuan Road are not collected, so the merchants in Shanghai North are not convenient to be different. Please exempt the sending of police to collect the photo fee to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. "</p>
<h3>Clock Industry Promotes Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The clock industry in this city, taking merchants saving the nation as its principle, and only resisting foreign goods as the means, has on one hand notified fellow businesses to seal up all existing Japanese goods. It is heard that some are willing to destroy them voluntarily. On the other hand, it promotes domestic production, establishing factories for self-manufacturing, and notifying fellow businesses to vigorously promote sales. Because clock factories in other areas have traditionally had no contact with the association, their products and trademarks are unknown. It is heard that the association has sent letters to various factories inviting them to join, and has organized a branch association for promoting domestic goods. Its contents are extremely comprehensive. In addition to Chairman Chen Duoming also serving as the director of the branch association, Yan Boying has been elected as the head of the inspection section, Zhou Linxiang as the head of the investigation section, Sun Meitang as the head of the publicity section, and Li Weibao as the head of the research section. Each section has four staff members, all appointed by the executive committee. Now, we will transcribe the letter sent to various clock factories as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully informing you, this association, considering the nation's difficulties worsening daily and now is the time for merchants to resist Japanese goods, domestic clocks have successively emerged. Although their factory locations are set up in other areas, their goods are actually transported to Shanghai for promotion. However, due to the constantly changing styles and trademarks, it is particularly difficult to distinguish them. In case unscrupulous individuals use counterfeits to confuse the genuine, and engage in price-cutting sales, it will inevitably affect domestic products. For prevention and promotion, all domestic factories within and outside this city should be notified to join this association as soon as possible, and promptly send the factory's products and trademarks to the association for circulation among fellow businesses, in order to identify them and prevent counterfeiting. This matter was submitted to the thirty-sixth executive committee meeting for discussion. Everyone agreed that if we don't do this we cannot resist the dumping of Japanese goods, and if we don't do this we cannot promote domestic goods that are just beginning to sprout. The resolution was passed and recorded. A corresponding record is enclosed, along with blank membership application forms and representative authorization forms, one copy each. These are sent along with this letter, hoping your factory will investigate and handle this accordingly, and reply is appreciated.</p>
<h3>Stone Found in Cow's Abdomen</h3>
<p>Guowenshe reports that Mr. Ma Qizhou, a famous chef in this city, purchased a cow's kidney yesterday morning intending to cook it for a meal. Upon dissection, he suddenly discovered objects inside the kidney that resembled neither stone nor bone, with multiple particles of varying sizes, the larger ones like hazelnuts, the smaller ones like beans. Their texture was hard and their color white, weighing over two qian (approximately 0.07 ounces). Furthermore, they had many gold specks, shining with five colors. According to the Compendium of Materia Medica, this is known as "Niu Huang" (cow gallstone). During the Gengzi year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty, the governor of Zhangzhou, Tu Dezhi, had no objections when a foreign monk claimed it was a precious treasure. Mongolians would soak the stone in water, play with it while chanting, and could pray for rain. Moreover, according to Jing Fang's "Book of Changes" divination, "When the army is strong and the ruler is martial, a stone will grow in the cow's abdomen." It is said to be a miraculous medicine for treating fright, toxins, and sores, similar to Gou Bao (dog gallbladder stone). However, the kidney is also a pure and empty organ, how could it produce a stone? Therefore, this is recorded in the hope that learned scholars will study it.</p>
<h3>Continued Records of Disaster Relief in Wugong County, Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The China Clean Living Association previously received a report from its Chang'an branch in Shaanxi Province stating that the disaster situation in Shaanxi Province was extremely severe. The branch established a porridge kitchen in Sian to aid the deceased. Upon receiving the report, the Shanghai General Association immediately donated 2,000 yuan and sent a letter notifying the remittance to be expedited. Mr. Wang Jishi of the Wugong Disaster Relief Arts and Crafts Institute of the association reported that the disaster in the county was tragic, and the starving and cold victims were unable to survive the day. On the 30th of last month, the General Association telegraphed 2,000 yuan in disaster relief funds to Wugong, Shaanxi, to be remitted by the branch's Mr. Lu Junhefu and Mr. Zhang Yanling to Mr. Wang Jishi in Wugong for receipt. Whether to increase the number of arts and crafts trainees, temporarily establish a shelter, or provide emergency relief, please let Mr. Wang consider carefully what is appropriate and implement it immediately. Yesterday, Gengyin Caolu, seeing the severity of the disaster in Shaanxi, vowed to donate 1,000 yuan in disaster relief to Wugong, and telegraphed the branch to transfer the funds to Mr. Wang, still in accordance with the previous agreement, to increase the relief as appropriate. At this time of extreme financial difficulty, no matter how much or how little the relief funds are, they all come from charitable people saving on food and clothing, which is particularly difficult. A telegram was also sent to the handling relief personnel to earnestly investigate and handle the matter, ensuring that the funds are not wasted and that the results are practical, in order to fulfill our duty to save those affected by the disaster. I believe there are many charitable comrades within the country who will follow the example of Gengyin Caolu and create blessings.</p>
<h3>Workers Smash Tram Windows</h3>
<p>Two Detained, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>The No. 8 tram of the British-American Tram Company, departing from Yangshupu at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, was ordered to stop by dozens of workers from the Shenchang Foreign Firm's machinery department near Ningwu Road. When the tram failed to comply, the workers threw stones, smashing five panes of glass. Officer 605, who was riding the tram, jumped out and arrested Gu Caiming from Zhenjiang, as well as Mu Di and Chen Mulin. They were taken to the police station and escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case, saying that the defendants were found to regularly ride the tram without paying, which led to an argument with the ticket seller. He then presented the broken glass as evidence. Officer 605 and ticket seller Su Yongxiang testified that the two defendants incited the crowd to commit violence and smashed the doors with stones. When questioned, the two defendants denied the allegations, claiming they were mistakenly arrested. Judge Shen Bingrong examined the evidence and ordered a duty lawyer to defend the defendants for a while. The court then remanded the two defendants and scheduled sentencing.</p>

<h3>Flower Association's Evil Deeds: Cutting Off the Heads of the Dead to Pray for Dreams</h3>
<p>The Deceased Was Originally a Victim of the Flower Association</p>
<p>Zhang A'yu and Others Inevitably Offended Against Humanity</p>
<p>At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, when the sky was not yet light, a Chinese policeman on duty at the Meibai Road intersection of Jing'an Temple Road saw a rickshaw puller frantically running eastwards, with an old man of about fifty years old sitting in the rickshaw, carrying a circular package by his side. The policeman, finding it suspicious that the rickshaw was being pulled frantically in the deep night, stopped the rickshaw and questioned the origin and destination of the passengers. The man in the rickshaw appeared panicked upon being stopped and gave evasive answers. The policeman ordered the package to be opened, but the passenger stubbornly refused to let go. After repeated coercion by the policeman, he finally relented and released the package. The policeman unwrapped it, revealing a horrifying human head, smeared with fresh blood, with eyes wide open and teeth bared. The policeman immediately brought the passenger and the rickshaw puller to the Jing'an Temple Road police station. Under strict interrogation by the police chief, the passenger identified himself as Zhang A'yu, from Yuyao, aged sixty, residing at No. 8 of Yangshupu Baidaitou, working as a small fruit vendor. He confessed that he and six or seven friends were fond of gambling on Flower Associations.</p>
<p>They recently learned that there was a new corpse in the Yizhong Cemetery in the French Concession of West Shanghai. The deceased was also fond of Flower Associations during his lifetime, but after his family fortune was depleted, he committed suicide by hanging. The group believed that if they could obtain the corpse's head to pray for dreams, it would surely be effective, but all were too timid to go. Only Zhang was relatively brave, so the group insisted on pushing Zhang to go to the Yizhong Cemetery yesterday morning, cut off the head of the new corpse, and carry it back wrapped up, so that they could pray for dreams. After obtaining the confession, the police chief immediately inquired about the names and addresses of his accomplices. Zhang confessed to the names Wang Zhilun, Tang Laosan, She A'er, Lu Shunchang, Sun Deli, Wang Zhangshi, and Gao Risheng, among others, all residing in Baidaitou. The police chief immediately dispatched policemen to arrest them at their addresses and seized a murder weapon as evidence, awaiting transfer to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Liu Chongwu and Others Convicted</h3>
<p>Liu Sentenced to Seven Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Liu Chongwu and others, for using bombs and handguns to deal with unscrupulous merchants privately selling Japanese goods, repeatedly staged tragic incidents of injury and death. They were arrested by detectives Zhao Bingkun and others from the Public Concession Police Department, and firearms and bombs were seized. The Bureau of Law of the Public Works Department, based on charges of premeditated murder, attempted murder, obstruction of freedom, and private possession of military weapons, filed a public lawsuit with the First Special District Court. Judge Qian Wenji has already held a trial and concluded the investigation, with a verdict awaiting announcement. Yesterday morning, the date for the announcement of the verdict arrived. Undertaking Chinese and Western detectives escorted the six defendants, Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, Zhu Liangkang, Hua Zhida, and others, along with the evidence, to the court. At 9:00 AM, Judge Qian ascended the second courtroom and ordered the six to be brought forward. After inquiring about their names, ages, places of origin, and occupations, he announced the judgment. Liu Chongwu was sentenced to six years and eight months of imprisonment for the crime of murdering Wang Yirong, and six months of imprisonment for the crime of private possession of military weapons, to be served concurrently for a total of seven years of imprisonment. Pan Hongsheng was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for the crime of private possession of military weapons. Cao Songshou was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for the crime of private possession of military weapons, and three months of imprisonment for the crime of obstruction of freedom, to be served concurrently for a total of four months of imprisonment. Tian Shuiyang was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for the crime of private possession of military weapons. Zhu Erkang and Hua Zhida were each sentenced to one month of imprisonment for the crime of obstruction of freedom. Tian, Zhu, and Hua were each granted a two-year suspended sentence. The firearms and ammunition were confiscated. After the judgment, Judge Qian briefly stated the reasons for the judgment, generally saying that regarding the case of Wang Zhengtao of the Maotai Foreign Goods Store on Xinzha Road being shot and killed, there was no evidence to prove that the defendants were responsible. Moreover, Cao Songshou had already left the scene when the incident occurred. Since the murderer in that case has not yet been apprehended, it should be judged separately in the future. As for Wang Yirong of the Yuyuan Heng Foreign Goods Company on Hankou Road being shot and killed by Liu Chongwu, not only was the evidence substantial, but Liu had also confessed. However, according to Liu's confession, Wang Yirong tried to grab him, so he opened fire. Therefore, his motive for killing was temporary and not premeditated, which is evident in the circumstances. According to the law, the crime of murder must be punished by death, or at least ten years of imprisonment. Considering that the defendant violated the criminal law due to the patriotic movement, which is not without justification, the sentence has been reduced by one-third. The other defendants committed obstruction of freedom, although it was not just once, it can only be regarded as a continuous act and dealt with as such. As for Tian Shuiyang, Zhu Erkang, Hua Zhida, and others, their crimes are light and they have no illegal activities in their past. This time, they were caught in the criminal net because of patriotism, so considering the original situation, a suspended sentence is declared. Judge Qian then informed Liu and others that if they were not satisfied with this judgment, they could appeal to the Second Higher Branch Court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, then requested that the three people who were granted a suspended sentence also be temporarily detained in order to consider whether to appeal. The court approved it, and the six people, including Liu, were still taken back to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3>Murder for Money in the Wilderness</h3>
<p>A Foreman Revives After Death</p>
<p>Three Murderers Sent to Court</p>
<p>Yang Zhenqing, from Anhui, residing at No. 10 Meihe Lane, Shanzhong Road, French Concession,</p>
<p>worked as a foreman at a construction factory on Jing'an Temple Road and had considerable savings. Jiang Zhaolin, a fellow villager, borrowed 80 yuan from him and gave him a bond. On November 7th of last year, Jiang invited Yang to Jiang Changgui's home in Jiangwan Jiangjing Temple to dine, and mentioned that Zhao Yangfu owed him money and would return it immediately. They then drank wine and chatted. Benji Zhao also came, so Jiang Zhaolin, Jiang Changgui, Jiang Yonggui, Zhao Yangfu, and a woman accompanied Yang to drink wine and dine. Afterwards, they paid him 80 yuan, and Yang returned the IOU. It was already very late, and he went home immediately, with Jiang and others accompanying him. In a remote area, Yang Zhenqing was stabbed wildly by them, resulting in a knife wound to the head and one to the abdomen. The silver dollars were also robbed. At this time, Yang was already dead. The perpetrators thought he was dead, which could be said without risk. Unexpectedly, after an hour, Yang Zhenqing gradually revived, but the pain was unbearable, and his moans were incessant. A patrol policeman from the Fifth District, Fifth Station happened to pass by, saw him, and sent him to the station, and then to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. He has gradually been able to move and his mind is clear, so he filed a complaint with the station, which sent police to arrest Jiang Changgui, Jiang Yonggui, and Zhao Yangfu. They were taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court for thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Female Performer's Disaster: Acquainted with Two Men, a Bloodshed Occurs in the Painter's Room</h3>
<p>A Thug Attacks with a Stick, the Painter Defends with an Axe</p>
<p>As a Result, the Thug is Seriously Injured and Dies Before Receiving Treatment</p>
<p>Zhang Yanxia, a Kunqu opera performer in the Dajing Troupe at the Sun Sun Theater on Nanjing Road, originally from Changzhou, aged thirty-two, has been with the troupe as a female martial artist. She has had a long-standing affair with Meng Lanting, a painter from Beiping who specializes in stage scenery. Meng is advanced in age, and Zhang, disliking his age, became involved with Zhang A'gao, a young and strong thug. Although Meng knew about it, he never interfered. However, Zhang considered the performer his territory and warned her that if she had any relationship with a third party, he would confront them as an enemy. At 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, Meng was working in the backstage scenery room when Zhang A'gao suddenly entered, leading to a fight. Li Hoxi and Tang Xianming, who were outside the room, heard the noise and went to check. Because the door was locked, they could not see what was happening inside. They broke down the door and found Zhang A'gao lying in a pool of blood, with several injuries to his head and face. Meng Lanting was sitting silently in a corner, his sleeves stained with blood. After repeated questioning, he admitted that Zhang had forcibly borrowed money from him. When he refused, Zhang attacked him with an iron rod. In self-defense, he grabbed an axe to resist. At that moment, the Yueyuan inspector arrived and summoned the police to arrest Meng and detain him at the Laozha Police Station. Zhang A'gao was taken to the hospital, but his injuries were fatal. He died before receiving treatment. His body was taken to the Felun Road morgue to await an official autopsy. The police chief ordered detectives to investigate the circumstances of the incident. Suspecting that Zhang Yanxia was the source of the trouble, they arrested her at No. 1255 Edward Road. Yesterday morning, she and Meng Lanting were taken to the First Special District Court. The murder weapon, an axe, two iron rods, and blood-stained clothing were submitted as evidence. Judge Qian questioned them. Police lawyer Ru BaoYi presented the situation of the case, stating that Meng Lanting was being prosecuted for murder under Article 282 of the Criminal Law. Whether Zhang Yanxia was involved was still under investigation. He requested temporary detention. Meng confessed that since Zhang A'gao became involved with Zhang Yanxia, he had repeatedly borrowed money from him. He borrowed 100 yuan last year and had not yet returned it. Yesterday he wanted to borrow 50 yuan. When I had no money to pay, he hit me with an iron bar. My left wrist was injured, so I took an axe to defend myself. At that time, I was mentally confused and did not care about the consequences. Zhang Yanxia testified that since she became involved with Zhang A'gao, he had extorted countless amounts of money from her. Whenever he ran out of money, he would come and demand it. Even if she had pawned everything, he would still find a way to satisfy his desires. She did not know why he clashed with Meng this time. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Qian ordered Meng Lanting to be remanded and Zhang Yanxia to be released, pending an autopsy. It is heard that the corpse will be examined by a prosecutor from the First Special District Court this morning.</p>

<h3>Large Amount of Opium on the Xing Shi Steamer</h3>
<p>A Total of More Than Eight Thousand Taels</p>
<p>Seized in the Fire Hold</p>
<p>The Xing Shi steamer of the Sanbei Company, coming from Hankou to Shanghai this time, had a large batch of opium seized on board. The following is a detailed account of what the reporter learned from the investigation:</p>
<h3>Special Tax Office Receives Report</h3>
<p>The Changjiang steamer Xing Shi of the Sanbei Steamship Company is currently chartered and travels between Hankou, Nanjing, and Yichang. On the 7th of this month, the steamer returned to Hankou from the upper Yangtze and was to sail to Shanghai. The Lianghu Special Tax Office in Hankou had previously received a confidential report stating that the steamer had loaded a large amount of opium in Yichang, intending to transport it to Shanghai for unloading. Upon receiving the report, the Special Tax Office remained silent and went to inspect the ship upon arrival.</p>
<h3>Administrator Assists in Seizure</h3>
<p>Chartered commercial ships do not load commercial goods or carry passengers, so they should not be inspected. The management right of the ship does not belong to the shipping company but to the special commissioner. When the Xing Shi docked, the Customs Division of the Lianghu Special Tax Office immediately went to the ship to visit the ship administrator, Li Wenhu, and explained that there was a huge amount of opium on board, smuggled in and intended to be transported to Shanghai under the guise of charter transport. Li Wenhu, upon hearing this, believed that this matter was related to his reputation, agreed to the inspection, and provided assistance in the search.</p>
<h3>Large Amount of Opium Seized</h3>
<p>The entire team of inspectors from the Special Tax Office, together with the administrator, boarded the ship at 11:00 AM on the 7th to search for smuggled opium. They searched separately, and at 11:40 AM, they seized dozens of large and small bags of smuggled opium in the fire hold of the ship's engine room. The Special Tax Office reported that the total weight was about eight thousand and several hundred taels. They also said that some of it may have been leaked out, because according to confidential reports, it was more than this number. It is thought that it was transported to other ships and leaked out.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition on All Yangtze Steamers</h3>
<p>After this case occurred, the investigation of smugglers revealed that most of them were being smuggled by stokers and others from the fire hold. After the incident, they all fled. According to regulations, the ship could only be released after the main culprits were caught. Because the Xing Shi is currently chartered, the ship administrator reported to the military, while one side was arresting the suspects. Yesterday, letters were sent to various shipping companies, requesting them to instruct all Yangtze steamer crew members to strictly prohibit smuggling prohibited goods. In the future, if found again, the ship owners and others will be held responsible. The seized large amount of opium was confiscated by the Special Tax Office.</p>
<h3>Foreign Pickpockets Active in Shanghai During the New Year</h3>
<p>Male and Female Thieves Are All Dressed in Elegant Attire and Are Very Respectable</p>
<p>Surrounding a Guest to Wish Them Happy New Year, Stealing Their Money in an Instant</p>
<p>Three Guests Lost a Great Deal of Money in a Certain Wine Shop in the Western District</p>
<p>...Most of the Pickpockets Are Russians...</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that on New Year's Eve, several foreign male and female thieves, dressed in elegant attire and wearing evening gowns, entered and exited banquets, entertainment venues, and used their pickpocketing skills. Almost all of the well-known clubhouses, wine shops, and hotel dance halls in this city were patronized by them. When the police received the report, they sent people to strictly guard various public recreation areas, and these uninvited guests were driven away. According to the police, there are currently about 60 foreign pickpockets, most of whom are Russians, who frequently travel to and from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Dalian, Harbin, and other places. Each time they arrive in a port, they stay for several weeks to several months. This New Year's Eve happened to be in Shanghai. It is heard that in a certain clubhouse, the money in the pockets of three male guests disappeared, and one female guest also lost valuable items in her handbag. It is suspected that it was stolen by two men and two women. In a certain wine shop, they also patronized and surrounded a guest to wish them a happy New Year. A few minutes later, the guest suddenly felt the money in his pocket disappear. Upon searching, the suspicious men and a woman had already escaped in the meantime. Only one woman was detained, but due to a lack of evidence, she was released. The men and women were all wearing evening gowns and beautiful clothes, so no one initially suspected that they were skilled pickpockets. A larger pickpocketing case occurred in a certain wine shop in the western district. A gentleman lost 300 US dollars. Two other guests were also victimized, with a total loss of around 2,500 yuan for the three of them. It is heard that a female guest also had 300 yuan stolen in a certain hotel near the Bund. Thanks to the alertness of the staff and detectives in the two major wine shops in the French Concession, it is heard that nothing was lost. In one, a certain manager saw two men and a woman acting suspiciously and immediately asked others to leave. In another wine shop, detectives drove several men and women out. There may be several other minor cases, but because the victims do not want to publicize them, they are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Crushed to Death by Car</h3>
<p>Su Fengshun, from Yancheng, aged 55, residing at No. 29 Meilan Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, made a living pulling a rickshaw.

Unable to avoid it, Su Fengshun was knocked to the ground, suffering injuries to his head and abdomen. An Annamese policeman No. 217 from the Songshan Road Police Station rushed to the scene, recorded the car number, and immediately sent the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment. He died at 10:30 PM.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, Today I read in your newspaper the news item about Duan Zhiyun, an engineer of the Yizhong Real Estate Company, fraudulently claiming 3,000 yuan. However, this person is not an engineer of our company. He was temporarily borrowed by our company as a clerk. Please publish this letter in your newspaper's Letters to the Editor section to correct the record. Sincerely, Yizhong Real Estate Company, January 11, 1933.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, Yesterday, the news in this city reported that a gangster fight with shooting occurred at the Huaiyang Teahouse in Zhabei, and members of the Security Corps participated in the incident. This does not match the facts. It was found that on that night, First Platoon Leader Luo Wenjie was leading his corps members on patrol when they were informed that a car was parked on Meiwei Road, attempting to kidnap a certain Chen. The platoon leader and others immediately rushed to investigate and saw the car parked empty on the side of the road. After inquiring, they learned that it had been there for a long time. Soon after, the chauffeur arrived, and while they were questioning him, Wang Agen and Chen Shiying came pulling and tugging. They immediately questioned them. Chen Shiying claimed that the gangster Wang Agen had a grudge against him and had now gathered a group to invite him to a "tea talk" in an attempt to scare and kidnap him. Wang Agen, on the other hand, claimed that Chen Shiying had flirted with the wife of his friend Fang on the road. Fang was indignant and invited them to a "tea talk" at the Huaiyang Building. He was only there to help, because Chen Shiying was unwilling to go, so he pulled him along. It was not kidnapping. At that time, the police on duty at the post thought that the chauffeur and the car had to be taken to the district. Platoon Leader Luo immediately accompanied them to the Fourth District, and at the same time, fearing that the gangsters would gather at the teahouse to cause trouble, he ordered several corps members to accompany Wang Agen and Chen Shiying to the building to investigate. Unexpectedly, upon arriving at the teahouse, dozens of gangsters, without asking questions, swarmed forward. The corps members, because they were outnumbered, were not only injured, but also had a pistol taken from them. However, in order to be cautious, even though they were injured, they did not fire their weapons. At that time, Jin Xianglin and Xiao Wenbin, members of the Eighth Platoon, happened to pass by and immediately reported to the police on duty. The police saw the surging crowd and could not dissuade them, so they fired two warning shots into the air. The gangsters then slightly calmed down, and Wang Agen and Chen Shi,</p>
<p>Ying were detained. Because the corps members were on official duty to the scene to suppress the disturbance, they did not dodge and immediately went to the district together. This is the real situation at the time. In addition to sending a letter to the Public Security Bureau, we are correspondingly sending this letter, requesting that you correct the record as soon as possible. Sincerely, Shanghai City Security Corps Management Committee, January 11.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, The news item "Recent Events at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company" in your newspaper on January 11 contained the following statement: "The Municipal Government of this city, upon seeing a report in the daily newspaper that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had borrowed money from Jardine Matheson, felt it was quite peculiar and specially sent Wang Shaozhai to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday to meet with General Manager Liu." This is not true. We are correspondingly sending this letter, requesting that you check and correct the record. Sincerely, Information Office of the Municipal Government's News Department, January 11.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, In your newspaper's news column on the 8th of this month, there was a report on the opening of the Longmao Yarn Factory case, stating that Zhang Geng had absconded, which does not match the facts. The court hearing was on the 6th. It happened that my appointed lawyer, Shan Yuhua, had returned to his hometown due to bereavement, and Lawyer Zha Renwei had also returned to his hometown for the New Year. On the 5th, I telegraphed to inquire and learned that they had not returned. The staff of the two law firms, fearing that they would not be able to attend the court and delay the debate, specially requested a postponement. On the morning of the 6th, the opposing lawyer, Wu Linkun, also came to my place, requesting a settlement, and also said that he could request a postponement. Therefore, in the afternoon, I rushed to handle other important matters first, and then rushed to the court, just in time for the court to adjourn. I met the opposing parties and Mr. Zha, who told me that he had arrived on the early train, and that the court had rescheduled the hearing for next Monday. I did not expect that the opposing lawyer, Wu, would take the opportunity to make such a deep-seated insinuation. I had already filed a counterclaim in this case and was waiting to engage in a legal battle with the opposing party. I thought that, as a general rule, those who resort to criminal intimidation for other purposes should be warned. What need was there for me to abscond? This kind of news strategy is not worth mentioning, but it concerns my commercial reputation, so I must ask your newspaper to correct the record solemnly. Please publish this letter. Sincerely, Lawyer Zha Renwei, representing Zhang Bingjun, January 11, 1933.</p>

<h3>Preface to "Easy Methods for Curing Lung Disease" by Ding Fubao</h3>
<p>My family, starting with my sister-in-law Di, died of pulmonary tuberculosis. After that, my father, my younger sister, and two nieces also died of this disease one after another. I have also suffered from lung disease repeatedly and am unable to protect myself. Alas, the scourge of lung disease has greatly afflicted my family! And among my friends, Fan Xiaolian Suxing, Wang Shuchang Maiqing, Gao Shangshe Zhong'an, Lian Shangshe Yiqing, and Zhengsheng, etc., also died of lung disease. Although our country does not have death statistics tables that can be used for verification, judging from what I have seen and heard in recent decades, lung disease accounts for about one-seventh of all deaths, or perhaps the actual number is even higher. Tuberculosis is truly a great enemy of mankind. Moreover, those who suffer from lung disease are mostly young people in the prime of life. Speaking from a family perspective, it is a very tragic event. Speaking from a national perspective, it is also a great misfortune. Therefore, when we hear the diagnosis of lung disease, we become depressed, thinking that the outcome of this disease must be bad, no different from being sentenced to death. But we do not know that this is a big mistake of the world. Lung disease is actually an easy disease to cure. If treated early, there is no one who will not be cured. Taking my own experience as an example, you can know that lung disease is not to be feared. I have been ill since childhood, with a weak body, small wrists, soft and weak muscles, chronic cough with phlegm, indigestion, and a pale complexion. Gu Junxiaodong said that I would definitely die of illness in the future. This was my condition before I was twenty years old. Extending to the age of twenty-eight, I came to Shanghai. The weakness of my body was still the same. If I walked one or two li, I would be out of breath and exhausted, and my spirit would also be exhausted. Moreover, I had not been able to lie on my right side for more than ten years. If I lay on my right side, I would feel very short of breath. Therefore, every night I could only sleep comfortably on my left side. Chinese medicine books say that those who can only sleep on one side will surely die. At that time, my weight was less than ninety pounds. A life insurance doctor examined my body and diagnosed me with stage 2 pulmonary tuberculosis. He did not dare to insure my life for ten years and advised me to take medicine. I did not believe him, so I sought out the methods of exhaling the old and inhaling the new and stretching the body like a bear, etc., from Hua Tuo of the Three Kingdoms period, which is what is called the Five Animal Frolics. However, this method of exercise is too vigorous and may injure the internal organs, so it is not suitable for a sick body. I learned from its meaning and improved it. At the beginning, the exercise was very slight and did not require any strength, so even the very weak could handle it. I also practiced meditation, concentrating on the "xuanguan" point, calming my mind and qi, putting down all past, present, and future affairs, and not allowing myself to think about them, so that my spirit could rest. I also adopted various therapeutic methods such as sunlight, air, and diet, all of which were in line with scientific principles. At that time, my self-confidence was very strong, thinking that my illness would definitely be cured, and I could use a firm, unyielding, courageous, and diligent spirit to fight off the demons of illness for decades to come. My single-minded, stubborn, and laughable persistence was like this. After practicing for two years, my sick body was indeed cured. At the age of thirty, I was hired by the Imperial University of Peking to be a teacher of arithmetic, physiology, and hygiene. The daily coursework was very busy, and I did not take a sick leave for almost three years. After that, I returned to Shanghai to engage in publishing and to treat people for more than twenty years. This year, I am already sixty years old. I can sleep comfortably on both sides when lying down. Although my beard and hair are white, my body is still strong. In these thirty years, I have never had a day when I had to decline guests due to illness or be bedridden and unable to get up. I had been compiling the "Shuowen Gu Lin" for more than a thousand volumes and was too busy to treat people for several years. Now that the "Gu Lin" has been published for a long time, and the "Gu Lin Supplements," which are 170 volumes, have also been published, I have a lot of free time every day. I plan to personally teach those who are physically weak like I was in my youth, or those who are middle-aged with anemia, qi deficiency, indigestion, neurasthenia, or excessive indulgence in lust, as well as those who are at risk of lung disease, or those who are already in the early stages of lung disease, or the elderly with declining physical strength, difficulty walking, chronic cough, etc., regardless of gender, can all learn. It will be effective in a month, and greatly effective in three months. If you can be determined and unyielding, you will surely be able to achieve the goal of preventing disease, without a doubt. Moreover, it is not only to prevent disease. After studying for several years, your work spirit will surely surpass that of ordinary people by several times, and others will only be able to sigh in admiration. My natural endowment is very poor, far inferior to that of ordinary people. After the age of sixty, I do not know if I can be as healthy as I was after the age of thirty. Thinking of this, I dare not stop my disease prevention and recuperation methods for even a day. Are there also those who, on the lonely shore of the wilderness river, hear the wind and rise up? Now, in addition to compiling the disease prevention and recuperation methods, I still have some free time, so I have compiled a book on easy methods for curing lung disease, using very simple language, in the form of questions and answers. Those with lung disease should implement it according to the law, and engage in a long-term resistance and annihilation of tuberculosis. Even after the inherent health has been restored, all the efforts made cannot be interrupted to prevent the recurrence of lung disease. Alas, if this book had been completed forty years ago, my relatives and old friends would surely have benefited from it. Why would they have been so afflicted by tuberculosis and withered away like this? Now that the proofreading is complete, touching on past events, I am filled with emotion and shed tears as I write this preface. Ding Fubao Zhonghu of Wuxi, January 1933, wrote this in the Gu Lin Study in the previous year.</p>
<h3>Reader's Forum</h3>
<p>The Panic Cycle Law and the "Anti-Imperialist" Problem</p>
<p>丨丨Letter from Mr. Wang Xiping丨丨</p>
<p>Reporter: Your newspaper's editorial "How Will 1933 Be?" in the past two days is like a morning rooster in the current world of opinion, and like a beacon in your newspaper. After reading it, I cannot help but sigh, "A rare and valuable voice!" However, there are still several points that Mr. Nai has said that I, in my ignorance, cannot understand. Therefore, I raise them below, respectfully seeking enlightenment: (1) Mr. Nai said: "The need for institutional change is just like the need for life to go through birth, old age, sickness, and death and be replaced. Therefore, the so-called 'panic cycle' is not a merry-go-round-style cycle, but a spiral-style advancement. 'Time flies and people age,' and the panic cycle is also constantly urging. The current system goes from infancy to full bloom, and from full bloom to decline. The fact that the current system must come to an end under a certain panic is something that we know is inevitable by looking back at the history of human society and observing the general course of human life." I completely agree with this statement. It is praiseworthy that your newspaper, which is usually so mature and prudent, has such a courageous statement exposing the inevitable fate of the current society. First, it shows that your newspaper's reporter has already stepped into the periphery of the new era. Second, it proves that the darkness of the times is about to reach the place where it intersects with light. This is something worth celebrating. But Mr. Nai also said: "We do not want to fundamentally deny the panic cycle law, but only need to modify it." Looking at his so-called modification, it is roughly as quoted above, recognizing that the panic cycle law is "not a merry-go-round style," but "a spiral style." The implication is that the previous claim that the panic cycle law was "a merry-go-round style" rather than a spiral style. Is Mr. Nai's statement really accurate? (2) Mr. Nai said: "The meaning of sacrifice is clear, and the value of suffering has been determined. Then we should sharpen ourselves to be ready, sing praises and approach, and rise up to fight to the death with the invading countries. The anti-imperialist struggles of colonies and semi-colonies are now the only option left, a desperate move. Then the only thing to do is to rise up together, and engage in hand-to-hand combat,..." These exciting words are naturally what we young people all want to say but cannot say, or say but cannot say with such pain and generosity. However, assuming that we now want to implement anti-imperialist work, implement what Mr. Nai instructed, "rise up together," I am afraid that before we even "engage in hand-to-hand combat," everyone will have already been "arrested." Then where will you have the opportunity to "engage in hand-to-hand combat"? In my humble opinion, if China does not want to implement anti-imperialism, but only talks about it, sends telegrams, and writes articles, then that is fine. But if we really want to implement anti-imperialism, then there must be three preconditions: unconditionally realize the three major freedoms of a democratic country; unconditionally lift the ban on political parties; and unconditionally grant amnesty to political prisoners. If one of these three conditions cannot be met, then anti-imperialism is just an empty lie. Know that throughout ancient and modern history, there is no nation or country that has turned the majority of its people into a state of apathy, afraid to even fart, and can meet the foreign powers on the battlefield. Therefore, I believe that the people must demand that the government, or the government should automatically and immediately realize the above three preconditions before there can be any talk of "anti-imperialism" or "resistance against Japan." What does your newspaper's reporter think?</p>
<p>Reporter's note: Mr. Wang's letter has such a detailed discussion of the editorial by Mr. Nai of this newspaper, which shows his spirit of studying on a regular basis. I admire him very much! In addition to hoping that Mr. Nai, the reporter of this newspaper, will reply to the two points raised, if any of you readers have any insights, please also send a letter to discuss them.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Issue of Resuming Diplomatic Relations Between China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>丨丨Letter from Mr. Fang Juehua丨丨</p>
<p>(The original letter from Mr. Wu Lengqiu appeared in this column on December 28th)</p>
<p>Regarding the various questions raised by Mr. Wu Lengqiu's communication to the reporter, singling out the question of "Who wanted to sever relations?" and "Who wants to resume relations?" as the core of all issues is indeed accurate. In my opinion, the severance of relations with Russia was caused partly by the Chinese people's lack of sufficient understanding of the Soviet Union, and partly because our diplomacy was not proactive, leading to a blind severance. Now, the Chinese people have a considerable understanding of it. At the same time, in the diplomatic field, due to the severe national crisis, the masks of the imperialists have been torn off, and we have realized the mistake of previously flattering the imperialists. Therefore, we resolutely resumed diplomatic relations. As to whether we will sever relations again in the future, it all depends on whether the government can maintain its spirit of truly independent diplomacy. In short, we don't need to be overjoyed or fearful about resuming diplomatic relations with Russia. The current national crisis still needs to be resolved by our own strength. In the 20th century, closing the door cannot prevent foreign aggression. The attitude we should adopt is that it is better to have one less enemy, and friends should not be used by the enemy. The impact of severing relations with Russia was that revolutionary diplomacy was in an isolated position, but it won applause internationally. The imperialists all said that China was indeed lovable and understood their intentions deeply. Now that relations have been resumed, they have learned that the giant of the East is gradually awakening, and therefore harbor a sense of suspicion, fearing that the two great nations will join hands and pose a powerful threat to their capitalism. But can we really stand up because of this? In my opinion, it's just a decadent and sickly ghost getting an injection of stimulants!</p>

<h3>Japanese Prostitutes</h3>
<p>— Qia</p>
<p>It seems somewhat irrelevant to talk about Japanese prostitutes amidst the anti-Japanese clamor; however, according to friends who have returned from Japan, Japanese prostitutes never offer non-Japanese tobacco and alcohol to their customers, which seems worthy of attention. Looking back at China, where imported goods are respected, prostitutes are indeed compulsory salespeople for foreign goods, but how can we not be surprised that even people who are looked down upon take using foreign goods as a sign of extravagance!</p>
<p>Why are Japanese prostitutes so patriotic? Because they already have faith and determination in their own domestic goods, and it is also due to the shifting social customs, but they would rather use second-rate Japanese goods and firmly reject non-Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Tobacco and alcohol are originally consumable items, and trying tobacco and alcohol in brothels is especially outside the bounds of normal life; but by analogy, before we eliminate the deep-rooted notion that imported goods are better, if the first step is not to be ashamed of using second-rate domestic goods, and if we can consistently do so, we can indeed recover a portion of the leakage from the huge per capita statistical charts.</p>
<h3>How Should Domestic Goods Find a Way Out Under Heavy Oppression (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Du Chongda</p>
<p>In the course of the collapse of the agricultural economy, the industrial economy has gradually emerged, and today most cities have entered the realm of capitalism, and even the rural economy is gradually changing its nature. However, this kind of change is created by the forces of the capitalist economy, not by natural change. Therefore, our country's so-called national industry is invariably manipulated and controlled by advanced capitalist countries, struggling to survive, relying on others for a living, and in an extremely miserable situation.</p>
<p>Especially since the tide of the economic panic in July 1929 originated in the United States and spread to capitalist countries throughout Europe, it has formed an intensification of the economic panic in capitalist countries around the world. Under these circumstances, the only way for capitalist countries to preserve their last breath is to encourage exports and restrict imports. Under the latter policy is the construction of high tariff barriers to resist the import of foreign goods. This is the so-called peaceful tariff war. And under the former policy is the intensified exploitation of weak nations and colonies, making them more impoverished, while further extracting their cheap raw materials, and even further planning to re-divide the world.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Forum</p>
<h3>Work That Should Be Done in the Domestic Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Pan Yangjie</p>
<p>In order to cultivate the faith and determination of Chinese people in domestic goods, the 22nd year of the Republic of China has been designated as the Year of Domestic Goods. Since the opening ceremony of this year's New Year's Day, these 365 days have been carrying a major mission at all times and must be completed without any slackness. Under the heavy national difficulties of politics and economy, being able to engage in practical work of avenging humiliation and resisting foreign aggression, the Year of Domestic Goods is indeed a very meaningful and valuable thing; however, there can only be a harvest after cultivation. We must realize all slogans and ideals before the ideal success can be achieved. Therefore, when the Year of Domestic Goods begins, we must not regard the propaganda of the opening ceremony as the completion of the work. After the opening ceremony, we must shoulder this arduous responsibility, cherish every second, and embark on the road to future success through hard work. Only by completing the work that should be done in the Year of Domestic Goods can we live up to the New Year's Day opening ceremony that contains great significance, and only then will we not waste the Year of Domestic Goods that bears a major mission!</p>
<p>How exactly can we cultivate the faith and determination of Chinese people in domestic goods? Analyzing the current national crisis can indeed move the emotions of the general public. However, according to the theory of marketing, the foreign goods that emphasize huge advertising costs and extremely strong sales power always threaten our emerging industries; and the facts further tell us that in the Chinese market flooded with foreign goods, to establish faith in domestic goods, in addition to advocating the use of domestic goods, there must be cooperation in production and sales to achieve victory on both the offensive and defensive sides of the commercial war. In the Year of Domestic Goods, we naturally cannot avoid working hard on this important task for the sake of resisting foreign aggression, avenging humiliation, and establishing faith in domestic goods; however, transportation, sales, and production are complex problems in themselves. If we do not have a scientific design in this short year, we will often delay due to paying attention to one thing and losing sight of another. Therefore, in order to accelerate and focus, it is best to take the month as a unit during the Year of Domestic Goods and hold a specific movement every month. Regarding production and sales aspects, such as improvements in production, coordination of labor and management, attention to personnel, financial turnover, etc., are originally specialized problems that cannot be solved in a short period of time, but they are also basic work in the Year of Domestic Goods movement and cannot be abandoned because of their complexity. If we designate one month to specialize in research, discussion, and experimentation, we should be able to obtain practical results. Therefore, we hope that the twelve months of the Year of Domestic Goods will all bear a mission and will not be wasted. According to the need and order, we will separately study (1) improvement of production; (2) efforts in sales; (3) removal of transportation difficulties; (4) financial turnover; (5) factory standardization; (6) raw material issues; (7) cost reduction issues; (8) how to cater to the customs of people in various regions; (9) training of salespeople; (10) labor issues; (11) cooperation between production, sales, and consumption; (12) implementation of consumer cooperation; from all aspects of domestic goods production and sales, we will seek fundamental improvements, establish standardization of domestic goods, consolidate the people's faith in domestic goods, and fulfill the meaning and mission of the Year of Domestic Goods.</p>
<p>The regional target of the Year of Domestic Goods is not limited to one place, and Shanghai is only the target of this movement. However, in this abnormal situation where foreign goods have penetrated into the inland areas, if the domestic goods movement does not expand from one place to various places, from cities to villages, the vast market will still not be able to be taken back from the hands of foreign goods. Therefore, after the specific implementation of the domestic goods movement in Shanghai, we should go to the inland areas to establish the faith of the national public in domestic goods and encourage the national public to make the determination to use domestic goods. However, the domestic goods movement in the inland areas does not need to use text or verbal propaganda exclusively. The domestic goods exhibitions held in Guangzhou, Qingdao, Henan, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places recently have introduced our original and newly created domestic goods to the general public, which has a great effect. Education institutions and industrial groups in various places can follow suit. As for the original special products in various places, after exhibitions and promotion, further improvements are made in terms of production. At a time when the rural economy is on the verge of danger, many people who have difficulties in life have been able to resolve them by advocating sideline occupations.</p>
<p>In the Year of Domestic Goods, in addition to carrying out practical movements in small units every month and promoting the domestic goods movement to various places, we should set up more domestic goods introduction agencies in various places to make consumers aware of domestic goods and introduce emerging domestic products to various places. Recently, the Shanghai China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the China National Products Guidance Center, and the Chongqing National Products Introduction Center have been striving to carry out this mission with good results. The industrial circles in Qingdao and Shantou have also seen this and have already started preparations. If we can start from the above-mentioned domestic goods introduction agencies that have already been established and have achieved results, and gradually expand, it will be of great help to this enthusiastic domestic goods movement!</p>
<h3>The Future of Our Country's Textile Industry (Middle) Zhu Xianhang</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>(A) Rationalize operations ... Don't engage in speculation ... Seek simplicity in exports ... Demand that raw cotton consistently meet standards (B) Rationalize work ... Reduce expenses (C) The government vigorously implements protective policies (D) The financial community regards large-scale textile investment as powerful cooperation (E) Chinese people purchase and use domestically produced textiles</p>
<p>B. Rationalization of Work</p>
<p>Industrial rationalization is the general term for standardization, simplification, and scientific management. It originated in Germany after the European War and was used to revive the collapsing industry. All countries have followed suit and promoted it to the fullest extent. As an industrially backward country, we should urgently take action to implement it. Moreover, with foreign cotton goods dumping in our country, our textile industry is fundamentally at risk of being shaken. There is no way to reverse the decline without actively implementing it. The so-called standardization, simplification, and scientific management refer to both machinery and work. The mechanical part has been described in detail in my book "Methods for Rationalizing Textile Work." The main point is to simplify the project, improve efficiency, and increase production to reduce costs. In terms of the rationalization of work, the only way is to reduce expenses, maximize the potential of workers, reduce the number of people, and improve their wages, so that individual income can be increased, while the total number of workers is reduced. Expenses include interest, wages, materials, salary for those with power, and miscellaneous expenses. The number of wages is the largest and the most flexible. The same work can be done by several people or by one person. When several people do one job, the total income is always more than the income of one person doing the same job because it is necessary to maintain the lives of several people. If the income is less, it is always difficult to make a living. Why not maximize their potential, reduce the number of people, and improve their wages to reduce the total amount of wages and reduce expenses? As for power materials, they must also follow the progress of technology, simplify the project, and seek to reduce their quantity. If expenses are reduced, the cost will be lower. Even if it is sold at a low price, it can be sold smoothly and will not suffer losses. For example, if the cost can be reduced by one or two, I can get one or two of profit when others sell at the original price, and I can avoid losses when others lose one or two. If our textile industry can work to rationalize, what is there to worry about dumping their yarn cloth.</p>
<h3>Industrial Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Mie Ran</p>
<p>Yesterday, I visited Mr. Wu Yun-chu, a chemical industrialist who had returned from a study tour of Europe and the United States. What he said was quite helpful for readers.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's study tour lasted for more than five months. His footsteps were all over Europe, America, Japan, and the Nanyang countries. He spent 20,000 yuan and gained a lot. It is said that he was tireless during his study tour, writing reports, recording his experiences, and writing letters at night. Sometimes he went to the library to study, and sometimes he went to the laboratory to experiment. He was diligent and happy, and he was admirable. Mr. Wu said: He will soon expand two factories, hoping to make a great contribution to the national chemical industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu said that the depression in European and American industries has reached its extreme. Workers only work five days a week, and only five hours a day, and there are countless unemployed. This is partly due to the sharp decline in purchasing power around the world, and partly due to the rapid progress of scientific management. Small factories that use manual labor and semi-mechanical methods have no place to stand.</p>
<p>Wu Yan said that the use of omnipotent machines and the progress of scientific management have made the world's artificial labor useless. Machines are becoming more sophisticated every day, and human resources are being eliminated every day. Mr. Wu visited a large carbon gas factory, which was very large in scale and was powered by machines, but there were only three employees.</p>
<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>My friend Mr. Lu Xin returned from Japan after studying crafts. When he talked about the Japanese running industry, he always used his full spirit, buried his head and did it to death. After any difficulties, he refused to give up. There is a pencil maker who has a history of thirty years. His hair is already gray, and his son has graduated from university. He also helps him work, without getting tired, without being respectful, without taking shortcuts, without being greedy for small profits, and without seeking quick success. Therefore, he can produce excellent products, lower costs, and make daily progress. Mr. Lu couldn't help but feel admiration. Japan is indeed my enemy, but its spirit and perseverance in running industry cannot be said to be not my teacher.</p>
<p>The sound of Shanhaiguan, when we try to close our eyes, we should recall the tragic situation of Zhabei on January 28th. When the country is in danger, our national goods factories should be prepared to serve the country. It is said that Japan had factories that manufactured commodities converted into military supplies during wartime, such as can factories converting into bombs, cotton weaving factories converting into military uniforms, enamel steel factories converting into iron hats and kettles, etc. A friend who returned from Japan had a plan for each factory to convert into military supplies, which made people shudder after reading it. Being the same people, living in the same country, when the country is in such a crisis, now is the time for industrialists to serve the country.</p>
<p>"There are still many good foreign goods that domestic goods don't have. Factory owners should quickly think of alternatives to domestic goods."</p>
<p>Everyone can say this ready-made sentence. But the prerequisite for running a domestic goods factory is economy and talent. Under the current situation, if domestic goods manufacturers do not have working capital, will financiers be sincerely and truly assisting them? If domestic goods manufacturers do not have real talents, will education institutions be able to humbly and diligently cultivate young people to meet the needs of factories? If there is no sincerity and strength, no matter how good you say it, it will not help at all, so please don't say it.</p>
<p>Since Chongqing organized the Domestic Goods Introduction Center, everyone has hoped that all localities will follow suit. Sure enough, recently, Mr. Li Zumo came from Qingdao and said that he had organized a Shandong Domestic Goods Introduction Center. Mr. Shi Menghu came from Shantou and said that he would organize a Shantou Domestic Goods Introduction Center. Lei Weinan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guangxi, also said that he would organize a Guangxi Domestic Goods Introduction Center after returning to Guangxi. These surging domestic goods introduction centers are all being established in this Year of Domestic Goods, which is very gratifying. On the Shanghai side, there is the China National Products Company, which is about to open. This news is of great help to the promotion of domestic goods. I hope that all localities will actively carry out these things, and contact each other. I think that places like Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Zhengzhou, and Taiyuan all have the potential to set up domestic goods introduction centers. At the same time, our manufacturers in Shanghai should organize domestic goods tour groups to visit and inspect various places in person, so as to further contact each other, so that we will not live up to this Year of Domestic Goods.</p>
<p>This issue has received many contributions from various places, most of which are very valuable, but due to the limited space, we have to publish them one after another. I hope everyone will understand!</p>
<h3>Discussion on Promoting Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Cao Yimin</p>
<p>Mr. Cao studied scientific management and sales in the United States and is currently the personnel section chief of Sanyou Industrial Company. This article is based on his experience and is very valuable. (Editor)</p>
<p>The 22nd year of the Republic of China is designated as the Year of Domestic Goods, so during this year; whether individuals, families, or groups purchase items, they must first choose from domestic products. However, what is domestic product? What is imported product? It is difficult to distinguish. Although the name is a domestic goods store, there are inevitably still imported products mixed in; in order to seek profit, there are often goods appearing on the market that have been changed. Buyers buy them back as domestic goods, and later it is confirmed by others that they are imported products; therefore, they must be very annoyed, and even discouraged from buying domestic goods again. This really disappoints the enthusiasm of those who love to use domestic goods in general. I myself have also encountered the above facts. In my personal opinion; it is best to ask the chamber of commerce to set up a commodity exhibition hall in a bustling area, not only displaying domestic products, but also displaying imported products. Domestic goods and imported products are displayed in one cabinet, with analysis and identification. Under the observation of the masses, they can know which is superior and which is inferior; patriotic people will be happy to purchase and use domestic goods, and at the same time can increase the public's knowledge of identifying domestic products. And I hope that major companies will also adopt this kind of identification display method, this is just a little bit of my humble opinion. Another point is about the employees in the domestic goods market; the staff in the domestic goods market must understand the importance of their responsibility. The salesmen in the domestic goods market are pioneers who have the ideology of seeking survival for the country and striving for glory for the nation. His merit is equal to that of the soldiers on the front line; therefore, this kind of staff must absolutely sacrifice their personal, courageous service spirit, then they must be aggressive in their daily work, and be able to treat customers considerately and diligently, and make buyers satisfied, so that buyers will be happy to buy domestic goods again next time; so as not to be like the shop assistants in ordinary stores who always drive away customers, so that buyers will have the bad feeling that they will not want to visit again after one transaction. I hope that the leaders who manage the domestic goods company will pay close attention to this issue.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Funds to Continue Distribution</h3>
<p>Estimated Expenditure for January</p>
<p>Jiangsu provincial schools and social education institutions' expenses for September (November for Zou teachers and Shixiao), the fund disbursement notices, although filled and issued by the Education Fund Management Office, and the date of written collection of funds was January 15th, it is heard that the Education Fund Management Office, in order to actively raise these funds, first sent Section Chief Liu Beihe to Wuxian, Wujiang and other places to borrow funds, Wuxian borrowed 20,000, Wujiang borrowed 10,000, Liu Beihe returned to the office at the end of December, and Section Chief Liu Zishen went to Songjiang to borrow funds, returned to the office on January 6th, and also borrowed 20,000. Together with urging other counties, it is said that those who have turned in to the treasury have nearly 200,000, according to the full month's expenses for September being 249,000 yuan, there are now 60 to 70% of the amount. After a few more days, around January 15th, the collection of September expenses should be largely without much problem, but the expenses for October, although the staff have signed, due to the insufficient treasury funds, the disbursement for September is still insufficient, it is feared that it will be difficult to collect the funds as planned on January 20th, it is heard that the original intention of the Management Office was that the Finance Department owed Jiangsu Province 365,000 yuan in education funds, which could be repaid 100,000 in the near future, but the department has not yet given a single penny, which has been affected. The Management Office heard on January 10th that the budget audit committee decided to allocate half a month's funds to the county for the November disbursement notice, and the remaining half month would still be paid in cash. The disbursement notice has been partially filled in the office, and the audit committee will sign again on the 12th. After the procedures such as sending it to the Education Department and the Director for signature, the date of issue is next Monday, and the October notice can be issued in a few days. However, the date of collecting cash on January 20th is, as mentioned above, affected by the Finance Department's failure to repay 100,000 in advance, which is more difficult, and it is feared that it will be difficult to meet the schedule. The Management Office itself is still working hard. It is heard that the Section Chief will be sent to Wujin, Yixing and other areas in a few days to urge the payment of education funds.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Women's Basketball Association Concludes Liangjiang Wins Green Team Retains Championship</h3>
<p>28丨32 Liangjiang Turns Defeat into Victory after a Crushing First Half</p>
<p>Chen Rongming's Amazing Performance Dominates the Entire Court</p>
<h3>Southeast Team Runner-Up</h3>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team retained the Western Youth Women's Basketball Association championship for the second year in a row. In the final match last night, they defeated their strong opponent, the Rowing Green Team, with a score of 30 to 28, creating a perfect record of nine wins in nine games. The runner-up Southeast Team defeated the Blue Team yesterday. The Blue Team was deemed to have forfeited due to using an unregistered player. There were also two other matches: Liangjiang B lost to the Yellow Team, and Chongde forfeited to the Red Team. The current Western Youth Women's Basketball Tournament has ended in its entirety (except for one non-championship match between the Blue Team and the Yellow Team) and is declared closed.</p>
<p>▲Liangjiang Team Escapes Death</p>
<h3>Chen Rongming Supports the World Single-Handedly</h3>
<p>Liangjiang's ability to defeat their strong opponent, turn defeat into victory, and the great credit goes to center Chen Rongming, whose agility, stability, and speed of movement are rarely seen. The shots from the left and right along the sidelines into the basket are truly a sight to behold. Chen Rongming scored 24 points out of Liangjiang's 32 points, which is truly not easy. Although Pan Meng did not score, her assistance was significant and she was able to run back and forth. Yang Sen did not show her strengths. Among the guards, Huang Shuhua was sharp throughout the entire court and stood out, intercepting countless balls. Chen Baixue and Shi Ruixia did their best and did not diminish in color due to their small size, and their performance was very satisfying.</p>
<h3>Green Team Unleashes Fierce Attack in the First Half</h3>
<p>In the first half, Liangjiang was in a losing situation, and everyone on the court was worried. Although Chen Rongming scored the first point with a free throw, the Green Team relied on its tall stature and passed the ball two or three times to reach the basket, scoring with a shot. The forwards were also very difficult to get the ball. The Green Team's strong players Fei Labiling Lu and others scored again and again, scoring six consecutive goals. The Green Team had 12 points, while Liangjiang had only one point. After Chen Rongming's struggle, the first quarter ended with a crushing defeat of 14 to 6.</p>
<h3>Gradually Catching Up, the Situation Gradually Changes</h3>
<p>The second quarter was the turning point for Liangjiang. Pan Meng replaced Chen Jucai and focused on attacking from both sides, which proved successful. The Green Team scored two more points, and Yang Sen also followed suit, scoring into the net. Chen Rongming continued, and Yang Sen scored two more consecutive goals, adding eight points. At the end of the first half, Liangjiang was only two points behind with 14 to 16.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Finds an Opportunity and Jumps to the Top</h3>
<p>In the second half, Liangjiang went from a crushing defeat to catching up, then surpassing and jumping to the top. At this point, the Green Team's entire lineup wavered, missing shots and panicking. Chen Rongming turned around and rushed into the basket, scoring three consecutive goals, and surpassed the Green Team with 20 to 10. It then became 24 to 18. At the end of the third quarter, it was 24 to 22. In the final match, Chen Rongming succeeded again, winning by eight points with a maximum score of 32 to 24. The final score was 32 to 28. The referees were Ms. Kemmer and Shu Hong.</p>

<p>In the match between Southeast and the Blue Team, the entire team's performance seemed unfocused. The match with the Blue Team was extremely close, with the score difference being only one or two points. After the Blue Team scored two goals after 17 to 17, winning with 21 to 17, but the Blue Team had a player who was not registered, so it was deemed a forfeit in favor of Southeast, and Southeast won 2-0.</p>

<h3>Spot Gold Floods Market, Gold Price Plummets Nine Taels</h3>
<p>Swap Deals Nearly Exhausted</p>
<p>Source of Supply Unimpeded, No Major Impact</p>
<p>(Central Bank Repeatedly Sells Spot, Unable to Curb Decline) Yesterday's market for standard gold bars was no less chaotic than the previous day. The pessimism reached its peak. Initially, large bars fell by 0.0625, American Bank fell by 0.125, and exchange rates all rose. Forward silver prices suddenly increased by more than 1%. Bank private telegraphs also increased by 0.125 accordingly. Therefore, the opening price was low at 798.5 taels. The exchange market opened with the near-term British exchange rate at 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 0.0625, and the American dollar at 28.0625 yuan, also stronger than the previous closing. After opening, the market immediately went downstream. Subsequently, due to banks' willingness to take delivery, the market also improved and rebounded, reaching 99 taels and 7 mace, but failed to break through the 800 tael mark. Although the Central Bank opened spot tenders, the large arrival of spot goods undermined confidence, despite the near exhaustion of swap deals. HSBC quoted British long at 0.125, while American rose by 0.25, seemingly excessive. The gold and exchange markets turned sluggish, and the decline was extremely severe, mainly due to a lack of buyers. At 92.5 taels, the Central Bank continued to inject spot, and the Hengxing, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Tongfengheng, and other agents bought for term bidding, providing support. The price rose slightly, but the market sentiment was weak, and goods were repeatedly sold. Although large accounts entered the market, the price mostly fluctuated, rising to 6 taels and 1 mace, before falling again. Hengxing then unloaded on behalf of its clients, and the final price hovered between 4 and 5 taels, closing at 94.5 taels. Although the situation during the half-day session presented a fluctuation pattern, it leaned downstream. The Central Bank opened spot tenders for no less than a thousand bars. Although the price did not win, it was able to hold on for a while. Swap deals were near exhaustion, and the chips were running dry, but the influx of spot goods did not hinder the overall situation. Therefore, the market confidence continued to be weak. The ups and downs during the half-day session are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Process Was Nothing More Than Struggling in a Slump</h3>
<p>The morning opening was five taels lower than the previous close, at 798.5 taels. Goods were exchanged for notes at nine taels, (goods were opened at 8 taels 8 mace) Banks opened strong on both British and American exchanges, but there were no respondents. Qianchangxiang was the first to sell, dropping to 98 taels. Dadecheng also sold, falling to 7 taels. The intraday market for April American dollars was made at 3125, and Qingfayong also sold. In a short time, it dropped to within 6 taels. Although the quantity was not large, it was not easy to respond, so it was at 95 taels and 8 mace. Hengyu and Qianchangxiang saw the low price and entered the market. Although the price rose slightly, it did not surge sharply, and it was still seen fluctuating between 7 and 8 taels, because Yongfeng and Zhaofengchang were constantly selling bars at this time. As for the January American dollar at 0625, Zhengjin wanted to buy it, and Hengxing, Hengyu, and Dadecheng competed to buy it. Zhengjin also bought the January American dollar already at 28 yuan, and it rose to 99 taels and 7 mace. However, the 800 tael mark was as difficult to cross as a flying bird. The intraday market for April American dollars at 25 could not be sold, and Yongfeng and others continued to sell, falling to 7 taels. Citibank settled the March American dollar at 1875, and Hengyu and Dadecheng also took the opportunity to enter the market, rising again to 9 taels and 5 mace. HSBC hung up its quote without any mercy, British large 125, and American grew by 25, and the market was weak. The price gradually went downstream. Although Hengxing bought with a limit price of 8 taels and 3 mace, the momentum of decline was only a matter of time. Except for a slight pause, a sharp drop then appeared, because the exchange market for April American dollars at 25, the bank was willing to sell, immediately dropping by more than 3 taels, to 96 taels. The news of the Central Bank opening the spot market came, and Hengxing and Qianchangxiang in the market entered the market for bars, and Zhifeng Yong Hengyu sold them, and the price advanced and retreated slightly to around 7 taels. However, the April American dollar had already strengthened to 3125, and the bank was willing to sell. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Dalian Gang, and others all sold, and retail investors followed suit and competed to sell, and the price was unable to hold, and 3754 month American dollars were not easy to sell. Yuanheng sold fiercely, and goods also continued to be sold in bars, plummeting by more than 5 taels, to 792 taels and 5 mace. After that, the Central Bank came in continuously, and opened the spot market without stopping. Hengxing was the first to enter, adding to 4 taels, and Sanjing bought January 1875, and Yuanmaoyong, Zhaofengchang came to buy, rising to 6 taels and 1 mace. The market was floating and uncertain. Hengxing sold 105 bars on behalf of its customers, and still retreated to about 3 taels and a half. Sanjing re-absorbed the April American dollar at 375, and Hengyu, Hengxing, Qianchangxiang, Chunyuan, and Yong all entered, and raised the price to 5 taels again. Daxingyong then sold, and so it returned to close at 94 taels and a half. Goods were sold before the close, and at this point they entered into competition to re-enter the bar market, so goods closed at 95 taels. The highest price during the half-day session was 799 taels and 7 mace, and the lowest was 792 taels and 5 mace, with ups and downs of 7 taels and 2 mace. The result was a decline of 9 taels compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Opens 1,400+ Spot Bars</h3>
<p>After being slightly quiet the day before, the Central Bank was active again on the market yesterday. It is estimated that it opened spot tenders five or six times during the half-day session, with Dadecheng, Tongfengheng, Qianchangxiang, and Hengxing acting as agents to enter bids for term tenders for a total of more than 1,400 bars. The price was roughly in line with the futures price, with the highest opening price being 97 taels and the lowest opening price being 93 taels.</p>
<h3>Face-to-Face Trading Sluggish, Sales Dominate</h3>
<p>Face-to-face transactions were dismal. According to statistics, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Hengxing, Yuanmaoyong, Chunyuan, and Yong were the buyers, while Daxingyong, Futaiheng, Tianfeng, Yongyuan, and Xinyong were the sellers. Each spot firm acted as an agent for the Central Bank and entered the market slightly, while acting for clients, they all exited the market. Dalian Gang sold slightly. Guang Gang Yifeng entered the market less and exited more. Hengxing entered the market for 800 to 900 bars and exited the market for more than 200 bars for its clients. In addition, various firms entered and exited from time to time, consistent with the past.</p>
<h3>Refined Raw Silver Market Stable</h3>
<p>The refined raw silver market is stable because the channels of distribution are wide and the demand is very high. However, the arrival of spot goods is also surging, so the price is not expected to rise or fall. Yesterday's market was very tight, estimated to be 9 taels with the addition of tax. However, there were not many transactions.</p>
<h3>Swap Positions Lacked, No Integer Transactions</h3>
<p>Because all firms lacked swap positions, there were no integer transactions except for acting as agents to clear goods. Due to the arrival of more than a thousand spot bars on the market yesterday, Yifeng Heng, a spot firm, offered a discount of 1.5 mace to Hengxing, which was a February payment, acting as an agent for Hengxing to clear the January bar. The transaction was huge, with 700 bars, which shows that the arrival of spot goods in Shanghai is not an exaggeration.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Strengthened by Gold Prices</h3>
<p>丨Foreign Banks Continue to Have Good Appetite丨</p>
<p>Although the foreign exchange market continued to show a loosening trend, the banks' appetite was still good, because the gold market was fluctuating, and the exchange rate also rose and fell accordingly. The morning opening of large bars was slightly reduced by 0.0625, and the exchange rate rose. If the rice price was satisfactory, it would reverse compared with the closing price, estimating the British exchange forward price at 1 shilling, 8 pence, and 0.0625. The American Bank exchange report fell by 0.125, and the forward silver price rose by more than 1%. Originally, the silver price of 125 could not match the rising trend of the previous day. Adding to the bank's private telegraph report of 125, the American dollar was also slightly stronger, so the near-term opening price was 28.0625 yuan, and people followed suit once they saw it. However, the gold price plummeted, and they had to strengthen with it. However, the appetite was still good. Citibank was always buying, and McCallie and Waba also entered more than they exited. There were not many gold industry transactions, and those who cleared positions were the majority. The intraday session had ups and downs of 0.0625 to 0.125. As a result, both British and American exchanges strengthened by 0.1875.</p>
<p>(British Exchange) The opening immediately trended downwards. The near-term asking price was 1 shilling, 8 pence, and 0.0625, 0.125 stronger than the previous close. McCallie entered, Anta exited, January 0625, HSBC and Zhengjin traded against each other in January, also 0625. Waba exited February 125, Anta still sold, Mitsui ate January 125. Transactions were light. Extended to the close, the asking price for January was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0625, (or possibly 125), February and March were both 125, and April was 1875. Bidding prices were all added by 0625.</p>
<p>(American Exchange) The opening was the same as the British Exchange, 0.125 stronger than the previous close. The near-term asking price was 28.0625 yuan, Waba was the first to exit, while South China entered February 125, Waba entered April 3125, and also entered March 25, Mitsui sold to Zhengjin January 0625, Zhengjin also ate the same month for only 28 yuan, which was sold by McCallie, while McCallie, from another hand, entered the same month for 0625, Sassoon exited, Citibank entered March 1875, HSBC entered, Xingye exited January 0625, Citibank entered March 25, Zhengjin continued to absorb Waba's sale of January 28 yuan, Zhongfu entered March 1875, Mitsui sold to HSBC January 0625, Xingye ate February 125, Citibank entered April 3125, Sumitomo ate the same month at the same price, Zhongfu entered March 25, Mitsui ate April 375, Central HSBC traded against each other in the second half of January 1875, Anta exited, Mitsui took January 125, Waba sold February 1875, Waba entered April 375, Waba sold to Zhengjin January 125. The closing asking price for January was 27.125 yuan, February 1875, March 25, April 3125, and bidding prices ranged from 1875 to 375. One American dollar equals 3 taels, 6 mace, 0 li, and 3.6 hao of silver.</p>
<h3>Large Bars Continue to Grow by 0.125</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 11th stated that large bars continued to rise. The closing price for the near term was 16 pence and 875, and the far term was 16 pence and 9375, each rising by 0.125 compared to the previous day. The British-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan, 3 corners, 5 fen, and 75.</p>
<h3>A Review of the Silver Market Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>Decline in Silver Production Does Not Benefit Silver Prices</p>
<p>The Reason Lies in the Slump of Sino-Indian Commerce</p>
<p>▲Restoring Sino-British Purchasing Power Can Restore Silver Prices▲</p>
<p>The most important influence on the silver market last year was the absolute reduction in the demand for silver in the East. Seventy-five percent of the world's silver production is usually absorbed by China and India. In 1929, which had the largest silver production of 261.61 million taels, the two countries absorbed nearly 84 percent. Although silver production decreased to 160.6 million taels last year, China and India consumed only 52 million taels, accounting for only 32 percent of the production.</p>
<p>Hunter and Harman said that if China and India were to become silver-selling countries, there is no doubt that world silver would constantly stand below the lowest record in world silver. Today, China and India are the world's largest silver-using countries. Normally, at this lowest record in silver history, they have reduced their purchasing power. There must be a reason for this. In our experience, the reason is not the reduction in silver prices, but the reduction in world purchases of Chinese and Indian export goods.</p>
<p>Analyzing the reason for the slump in the silver market, the consensus is that the silver currency system is not working. But the real reason is that the East must increase its purchasing power. To increase purchasing power, the goods of China and India must be sold smoothly in the world market. Therefore, if the commerce of the two countries can be revived and prices increase, it will be of great benefit to the silver market.</p>
<p>Hender and Harman have no derogative intention regarding speculation, because speculation is indeed an essential aspect of regulating the market. However, they consider it unwise for speculators to raise silver prices last year, because the silver market has never had a stable reason to provide speculators with information.</p>
<p>According to their estimates, the silver production in 1932 was approximately 160.6 million taels (160,600,000), of which the United States produced 23.4 million taels (31,400,000), Mexico 71.7 million taels (88,900,000), Canada 18.3 million taels (20,400,000), South Africa 12.4 million taels (19,700,000), and other parts of the world 34.8 million taels (35,700,000).</p>
<p>The supply of old silver in 1932 is estimated to be approximately 22.6 million taels, of which the Indian government sold 24 million taels (35,000,000). The total of new and old silver is 270.2 million taels.</p>
<p>It is estimated that of the 270.2 million taels of silver consumed in 1932, India consumed 12 million taels, China (including Hong Kong) 40 million taels, and Germany 22.8 million taels.</p>
<p>The amount of silver used for industrial and decorative purposes in the United States and Canada is approximately 22 million taels, in the United Kingdom approximately 8 million taels, and in Mexico approximately 1 million taels. The amount used for silver coins is estimated to be 20 million taels in Germany, 23.2 million taels in Mexico, 2.8 million taels in Cuba, 500,000 taels in Yugoslavia, and the remaining 1.2 million taels are stored in the United States. The other 53.7 million taels are scattered throughout the world.</p>
<h3>The "Li-Settle" Market: Rising and Falling in Cycles</h3>
<p>Because foreign exchange has been slightly sluggish recently, the market price has had little possibility of competition. In the end, rising and falling have been heard from time to time, but the overall trend has been fluctuating in a cycle, and there has not been much progress or degradation. Looking at the past few years, before and after the New Year, there have always been changes in the "li" prices. This year, because the market is usually sluggish and the closing has not been fully summarized, it is feared that the market situation hereafter will be different from that of previous years.</p>
<h3>"Li-Settle" Market Stable</h3>
<p>The early market for "foreign li" was still the same as the previous market, at 7 qian, 1 fen, 3 li, 6 hao, 2 hu, 5 si. The afternoon market continued to be slightly smaller by 2 hao and 5 si, at 7 qian, 1 fen, 3 li, 3 hao, and 7 si. Compared with the early market the previous day, it was a total of 6 hao and 2 si smaller. The early and afternoon markets for "silver settlement" both opened at 2 fen. The drawing fee plus the Yong fee was only 2 to 3 fen. The silver root situation was generally not very active.</p>
<h3>Auxiliary Coins Interact</h3>
<p>Jiangnan small foreign coins were both 6 qian, 3 fen, 2 li in the early and afternoon markets, 3 li smaller than the previous day. The transaction volume was 7,000 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 qian, 2 fen, 0 hao, 8 hu, 7 si in the early market, and 6 qian, 2 fen, and 1 li in the afternoon market. The transaction volume was 95,000 jiao in the early market and 50,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 386,500 wen, with a transaction volume of more than 38,600.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollars In and Out</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bank's collection and settlement of "silver settlements" did not seem very simple due to the closing of accounts, but the demand was not high after all, so the collection and settlement were not busy. Chinese merchants collected and settled more than 3.1 million in bills, foreign merchants more than 2.1 million, and advances continued to be made every day, with more than 2 million still being made yesterday. Telegraphic transfers amounted to 840,000, pledge transactions amounted to more than 1.1 million, and various cargo exchange taxes and other miscellaneous items amounted to more than 9.2 million. Special accounts amounted to more than 3 million, warehouse entries were 500,000, warehouse exits were 900,000, and money house silver public orders collected and settled more than 29 million. Pledge collections and settlements amounted to more than 3.9 million, and various road remittances amounted to more than 900,000. The amount for closing accounts was more than 1 million, and cash collection was 300,000 to 400,000. The early market for "foreign currency" exchange bills made 620,000, and the afternoon market made 1.075 million. Banknotes made 55,000 in the early market and 30,000 in the afternoon market. Outside the market, banknotes made 80,000 in the early market and 75,000 in the afternoon market. Checks made 40,000 in the early market and 20,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading made 550,000 in the early market and 1 million in the afternoon market. The exchange between foreign accounts of various banks collected and settled more than 1.3 million, and the banknotes in and out amounted to more than 2.1 million. Foreign pledge transactions amounted to more than 800,000, money house foreign public orders collected and settled more than 8.6 million, foreign head fee collection amounted to more than 1.54 million, foreign loan exchange in and out amounted to more than 1.4 million, and customer route sources were more than 300,000, with sales of 200,000. Small money houses traded more than 700,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Continue to Rise by About One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 11th), various spot goods of the Chinese Securities Exchange were opened, but the transaction was extremely rare. Only 12,200 yuan was made throughout the day. The futures were calm due to the stable market price, and the market sentiment also turned quiet. The transaction was far less than the previous day, estimated to be 7.78 million in the morning and afternoon. In addition to 1.85 million for salt tax and 1.46 million for consolidated tax, the rest were only around 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Customs tax and 96.6 were extremely clear. As the New Year is approaching, the environment is calm, and general large accounts are not expected to have huge amounts of entry and exit. In the early morning, they all jumped up by 7 to 8 jiao. Although they fluctuated and strengthened later, the ups and downs were always very small. As a result, they all continued to rise by about one yuan compared with the previous day. Only 96.6 fell slightly, and customs tax and reorganization were only good by a few jiao.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Suddenly Rises</h3>
<p>A report from the Xinfeng Foreign Company stated that the New York stock market suddenly rose on Tuesday (the 10th). Local speculators first entered the Chicago wheat market, and general short accounts rushed to cover their positions. The wheat price soared by more than 2 fen. At the same time, US Steel announced that the outstanding orders for December were similar to those in November, which boosted confidence. Wholesale accounts enthusiastically entered the stock market, and the market could rise sharply. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.5 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 64.125 Up 2.04</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 29.44 Up 1.12</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 29.00 Up 0.65</p>
<p>40 Bonds 80.06 Up 0.34</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Returns to Sluggishness</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned soft again, and the ups and downs are difficult to grasp, with advances and retreats between one and two taels. In fact, during the closing of accounts, the market sentiment is scattered, the northeast situation is dangerous, and the market price is slightly higher. The seller will start selling, and the inventory is too thick. In the yarn and cloth warehouses, the accumulation is increasing day by day. Most of these goods are in the hands of financiers for arbitrage transactions.</p>
<h3>The Man-Made Market: Manufacturers Sell to Profit</h3>
<p>The opening of the man-made market was stable in the near months and trending downwards in the far months, because a certain manufacturer sold to profit.

<p>The cotton market is gradually softening. The group fleece cotton price in Tianjin has fallen slightly, resulting in a slightly flat market sentiment. However, American cotton has risen, and the exchange rate has lengthened, and the gold market has shortened. However, the general buyers' intentions are still tight, and they are unwilling to relax, because the price of foreign cotton is high, and it is not possible to come to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>US Cotton Continues to Rise to Cover Shorts</h3>
<p>丨India and England Still Lack Progress丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially tired due to sales by foreign companies, but later it was strong due to powerful Wall Street and short covering. It is estimated that futures rose by 9 to 15 pounds, and spot goods rose by 10 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 4 to 6 points, and spot goods fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 9 points. Indian cotton was tired due to long position liquidation and sales by speculators. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 2.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.75 rupees. The original telegraph is recorded on the left (telegram on the 10th).</p>

<h3>Rice: White Kernel Rises Two or Three Cents</h3>
<p>Nanshi Plans to Build Rice Warehouse... Can Store 110,000 Bags</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply was slightly larger, with over sixty firms participating. Retail sales revived, and prices rose slightly by about a cent. However, wholesale demand was flat. High-quality goods did not depreciate, while medium and lower grades softened slightly. Foreign Indica rice arrivals remained scarce, sales were active, and the market situation became fresher. Yin Yuan rice was in good demand, with few regular deliveries, and the price of high-quality goods also increased.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-five or six ships arrived from various regions. White kernel囤户 temporarily suspended operations, but retail sales in stores were still active, causing the price to rise again by two or three cents. Continuous arrivals of Bo Dao and early rice saw some retail activity, with prices rising slightly. Du Bu top-grade rice arrivals were small, with sales of two or three cents. Foreign rice 　　　　　cents, Yuan retail also 　　, three or four cents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the continuous price declines in the Nanshi rice market, the market is now greatly different from the past. However, there are no warehouses between the wharves, and there is no place to temporarily store surplus rice, which is quite inconvenient. Currently, there is a property of over nine mu for sale near the area. The Bean and Rice Industry Association immediately purchased it. Two wharves will be built along Pu Zi, and a new-style three-story rice warehouse, built with reinforced concrete, will be constructed by the 久記營造廠, designed and built by Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang. It will be able to store 110,000 bags of rice. The land price is requested at 240,000 taels of silver. Besides issuing 100,000 taels of construction public bonds, the remainder will be raised through loans. It is estimated that it will be cleared in about ten years.</p>
<h3>Futures Flour Becomes More Popular as the Date Approaches</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, it showed a firm and popular trend again. As foreign wheat quotations rebounded by about four, five, six, seven, or eight cents, prices were generally higher after the opening, rising roughly one or two cents compared to the previous day's closing. However, after the second session, as Fufeng gradually sold off, the pressure was intense, so forward contracts showed some weakness. By the afternoon opening, the current month's market atmosphere revived greatly, as rumors spread that Fuxin's spot goods had already sold out, and there was still a need to cover the current month's standards, so the market atmosphere was unusually excited, reaching a high of 1 tael, 9 qian, 9 fen and a half. However, Fufeng continued to sell freely for all months after March, causing market sentiment to be firm with a hint of softness. Nevertheless, with spot flour being so profitable, the internal and external market sentiment should eventually be firm. As a result, the current month rose 2 fen, February and March rose 1.5 fen, April rose 7.5 li, May rose 2.5 li, and June rose 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Spot Wheat Scarce, Futures Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a soaring trend. With foreign wheat quotations rising rapidly by four, five, six, seven, or eight cents, the internal and external market sentiment was naturally shaken. Due to the scarcity of spot wheat in the current month, and the fact that factories were eager to produce flour from the arrived foreign wheat, once they had initially shorted, the opening price in the morning reached 3 taels and 7 qian and 2 fen, then a little lower. For months after February, some traders, seeing the extreme popularity of spot wheat, feared that the same situation would occur in the future, so they were eager to cover. It is rare to see this kind of situation when foreign wheat is freely available for fixed purchase. (Australian wheat's fixed price is currently still at 3 taels and 7 qian and 1 ). As a result, the current month rose 4 fen compared to the previous day, February rose 8 fen, March and April rose 7 fen, and there were no other transactions.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Soars as Shorts Cover</h3>
<p>On Tuesday (the 10th), Chicago wheat first fell due to a weak Liverpool market, then rose due to Wall Street buying and short covering. The total volume traded on the 9th was 20 million bushels. The market prices for the 10th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>May Futures　30.　　　　Up 2.30</p>
<p>July Futures　　9.875　Up 2.125</p>
<p>September Futures (Old Crop)　　0.573　Up 2.00</p>
<h3>Year-End Approaching on the Abandoned Calendar, Hakka Dollars Sell Well in Time</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hakka Indica and Hakka Hua were slightly dull, but market inventories were low and prices remained firm. Southern merchants' appetites were still weak, but Northern merchants had recently begun paying attention again. Although there were no large merchant activities yesterday, with supply and demand evenly balanced, expectations were high for continued purchases from the two major sales areas in the North and South. Both cargo owners and囤户 expressed intentions to raise prices. Later, Northern merchants purchased 250 bags of Hunan machine-processed oil, and Southern merchants from Quanzhou purchased 110 bags of Hunan machine-processed red. The price of machine-processed red opened at 9 yuan and 02 fen, up 2 fen from the previous day, while the price of machine-processed oil was 9 yuan, 1 jiao, 8 fen to 9 yuan, 0 jiao, 8 fen, up 4-5 fen from the previous day. Not many Hakka dollars arrived last Sunday, and inventories were also low. Because prices rose sharply in the latter half of last month and two batches sold well, the market price weakened, and fewer goods arrived. Recently, as various parties purchased year-end goods, all sources arriving downstream were snapped up by this street. The downstream market price of yuan dollars rose to around 11 yuan yesterday, and some on this street switched to purchasing Hakka dollars. The Hakka dollars, which were originally purchased by Northern merchants, were then competed for, and the price rose by nearly a jiao. Demand was still strong, but inventories were low, so a price increase in the future market is expected. The entire city sold 200 bags of Hunan machine-processed yuan, with prices already rising to 10 yuan, and 79 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed yuan, priced at 9 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Soybean Downtrend Established</h3>
<p>The soybean market has become stable, with a steady flow of goods arriving in this port. Cargo owners are now willing to sell. It is hoped that Hakka Hua will become more popular in the future and there will be a renewed rise. Yesterday, one carload of Dalian soybeans, one carload of Zhengyang beans, two carloads of Huai beans, and one carload of Wuhe beans were traded. These were distributed by traders in this port to inland workshops. Traders on this street purchased 100 bags of Donggou Du Qing, and 250 bags of Pudong Du were purchased by Guang merchants. 100 bags were traded on this street. Not a few Niuzhuang Hong were also purchased by inland merchants. The market is stable and remains unchanged. Yesterday, traders purchased 1,500 　 of peanuts and 600 pieces of soybean oil.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand, White Dutch, and Red Each Down 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a decline in　金　, and actual sales became quiet. The trend was slightly sluggish. The guild's opening bid for No. 24 coarse sand white was 15 taels, 9 qian and a half, but very few traders showed interest, and there was a lack of appetite. Later, the deal was done at 15 taels and 9 qian, with slightly more transactions, down 5 fen from the previous day. No. 89 Dutch red was also down 5 fen, at 12 taels and 6 qian.　 青 continued to open 300-400 bags yesterday, and the price was similar to before, but the situation was slightly sluggish. As the period for year-end settlements is approaching, the volume of transactions in the market is gradually decreasing. If cargo holders do not urgently seek sales, the market price can be expected to stabilize temporarily.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from New York on the 10th, spot price was 7 jiao, 8 fen and 125 li. Futures: January unchanged, March, July, and December each down 3 points, May and September each down 2 points.</p>
<p>London futures: March, May, and August each down 25. The Java white kernel market remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>Metal: American Huisi Iron Received Telegram Yesterday Regarding Spot Goods</h3>
<p>American Huisi iron. Overseas factories have long reported a shortage of goods. Although traders in this port who want to place orders have been inquiring everywhere, the foreign firms' replies consistently state that the factories have no goods. Yesterday, American companies such as Shen Chang, Hua Da, and Mei Kang received telegrams from factories in New York stating that there were over 400 tons of spot goods available, priced at US$5.70 per case (200 pounds) (equivalent to 25 taels in Shanghai, including miscellaneous expenses). Therefore, traders in this port felt that the price was too high and difficult to calculate, so they countered with a price of US$5.45. However, whether the transaction can be completed will depend on the telegram from the foreign firms tomorrow. It is reported that the shipment period is in February and March.</p>

<h3>Dark Arcadia</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The Shanxi Model Province, an Arcadia that people yearn for, has received unanimous praise from observers from all sides in the more than ten years since the establishment of the Republic of China. In the last six or seven years, this praise has become nothing! What is particularly despairing is reading the Taiyuan dispatch on the suppression of opium in Shanxi Province published in this newspaper! Unexpectedly, the Arcadia would be so dark.</p>
<p>The dispatch says that Shanxi, which has turned into a (illegible), has recently been flooded with drugs; in the counties of the central route, the sales of white (illegible) (i.e., heroin) are worth more than 300,000 taels annually, with each tael worth 60-70 silver dollars. In the southern route area, red pills (i.e., gold pills) are selling well everywhere. These few reports are enough to show that the homes of the Arcadia have been shrouded in layers of dark clouds of poison, not to mention the dark situation in Shanxi Province is more than this?</p>
<p>Tao Yuanming's masterpiece! Peach Blossom Spring is about obtaining great light from small light. The record says "It seemed as if there was light," which is called small light. "Walking a few dozen steps further, it suddenly opened up," which is called great light. When it comes to Shanxi Province, which is known as Arcadia, it is about obtaining great darkness from small light. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, wars have broken out frequently in various provinces, but only this Arcadia has been relatively peaceful, which is called small light. Until now, Arcadia is flooded with drugs; it is not good to say "Walking a few dozen steps further, it suddenly opened up," it only deserves to be said that after twenty years, it is mistakenly dark. The happiness of the people in Peach Blossom Spring can only be seen in Mr. Tao's record! "The elderly and children were all happily enjoying themselves," which is truly a "Utopian scene of happiness." The current Arcadia can also be called Utopia, but it should be interpreted differently, as a place where opium is entrusted! As for "The elderly and children were all happily enjoying themselves," these two sentences are no longer applicable, what is applicable is gold pills and white powder, and they are openly sold.</p>
<p>Arcadia has changed into anti-Arcadia, and then into dark Arcadia. Whose fault is this?</p>

<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>The same old tricks of the second master!</p>
<p>In the final years of the Zhou Dynasty, when the feudal lords were rebellious and the world was obviously in great chaos, that old Mr. Confucius of Qufu simply had no way to solve it. Although he served as prime minister in the State of Lu for four months, he was unable to develop his ambitions. He had no choice but to travel around the various states, hoping to meet like-minded people to take action. Coincidentally, at this time, all the states wanted to become hegemons and champions, and their minds were full of swords and spears, tricky and eccentric ideas. Who would listen to your benevolence and righteousness? Mr. Confucius had no choice but to return to his hometown dejectedly, picked up his pen, and wrote a "Spring and Autumn Annals." Originally, the writing style of the Spring and Autumn Annals was very cautious, with the purpose of implicitly praising and criticizing the figures of the time, so as to deter rebellious and treacherous subjects. Although his proud disciples, such as Ziyou and Zixia, could not praise a single word, it can be seen how cautious Mr. Confucius was. However, although Mr. Confucius wrote this great article, by the Warring States period, the world became even more chaotic and out of control. Although Mencius emerged and advised people not to value the word "profit," it was of no use. As a result, everyone slaughtered each other, and after more than two hundred years, the Han Dynasty finally brought peace. Although Mr. Confucius's great work "Spring and Autumn Annals" was ignored by everyone at the time, who dares to say that it has no value now? The current China is like the closing of the Spring and Autumn period and the opening of the Warring States period. Mr. Lin Yutang is rushing to write a "Analects," and Mr. Zhou Shoujuan is also rushing to write a "Spring and Autumn Annals," both wanting to play the old tricks of the second master Confucius. Their ambitions are commendable, but in fact, they are of no use at all! I'm not just talking nonsense, isn't everyone still playing with Sun Tzu's Art of War and the Yellow Stone Duke's Six Secret Teachings? Otherwise, it's better to write a few books like Guiguzi, Tao Te Ching, and Zhuangzi. I don't know what the two gentlemen think?</p>
<h3>A Perspective on the Metropolis</h3>
<p>— Long Sao</p>
<p>丨The Line of Life Between Two Classes丨</p>
<p>Giant cranes are hoisted high in mid-air, holding iron bars and wood stones, digging deep into the strata, erecting magnificent and exquisite buildings or residences. As you walk along Great West Road, Avenue Road, Route Massenet, Museum Road, Nanjing Road, North Sichuan Road, etc., you will see these buildings that are exchanged for tens of millions of gold. There, there are hot water radiators that drive away the cold of winter, there are high-class elevators that replace people's walking, there are elegantly decorated gardens, there are plump Nordic breeds of dogs, there are proud servants, and there is the scent of perfume...</p>
<p>A 1934-style car is parked on the side of the door, a Russian strongman holding a pistol standing next to the master or mistress,</p>
<p>young masters and young ladies sitting around the fireplace talking about movie stars and the like. Shanghai, this Shanghai of the rich, is as beautiful as spring flowers, as bright as gold, and as fragrant as wine!</p>
<p>A gentleman, along with his family, chain-like servants and dogs, occupy a huge mansion and enjoy themselves there.</p>
<p>However, let's turn around and take a look at the residents in the matchbox-like city. Five or six families have to gather in a single foreign-style house, and the middle section of the escalator is suspended in the air, commonly known by Shanghai people as the so-called "mezzanine." There, the toilet and the baggage are placed together, the parents-in-law and the sons and daughters-in-law sleep in the same room, and after the children get out of school, they have to study old books under the oil lamp, but the chirping of sparrows and the noise of scolding around will disrupt your tranquility, so every worker reduces his wages for working on the docks tomorrow due to insomnia, and every elementary school student often cannot complete their limited education due to the lack of a good environment!! There is no need to talk about the people on the roads anymore, how many laborers are sleeping on the sidewalks again! Shanghai, this Shanghai of the poor, is as dark as mud, as cold as a knife, and as foul-smelling as disinfectant!</p>
<h3>The Bee's Sting</h3>
<p>— Zhi Qing</p>
<p>Learning should be like a pyramid, with common sense and all common sciences as the foundation, and specialized knowledge just like the spire.</p>
<p>▲ Love is a beautiful flower, blooming on cliffs, if we want to pick it, we should go through all the hardships to find it, not something that can be obtained by picking it up.</p>
<p>▲ Failure is a good opportunity to indicate that we should not make mistakes in the future. Honest failure is not dishonorable, but being afraid of failure is truly dishonorable.</p>
<p>▲ There is nothing impossible in the world, just doing it and seeing is the best move.</p>
<h3>The Poor and the Rich</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Now is the era of money, so it is difficult for the poor to gain a foothold in this world, while the rich have the authority to rule this world!</p>
<p>Some people say: "The city is heaven for the rich and hell for the poor." I say: "The city is heaven for the muddled and hell for the clear-headed."</p>
<p>The poor people walking hope that there are no cars on the road, and the rich people sitting in cars hope that there are no pedestrians on the road, because the poor want to walk slowly on the road, and the rich want to drive fast on the road.</p>
<p>Those with money rely on money and can do anything, so I say "The rich are a kind of machine." Those without money have nothing and cannot do anything, so I say "The poor are a walking corpse."</p>
<p>The poor become rich through diligence and frugality, and the rich become poor through extravagance and laziness. The poor become rich, and the rich become poor. This is a cycle of wealth and poverty.</p>
<h3>Sketches Between the Sexes</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Girlfriend is a Lover</p>
<p>"If you say that a friend of the opposite sex is a lover, then I must have at least a dozen lovers!"</p>
<p>He replied to his friend in this way. When he received a long letter full of praise celebrating his success in love for no reason.</p>
<p>▲ The Cost of Kisses and Smiles</p>
<p>At the end of the month, he received his salary. He sent five percent of it to his old home in the countryside, and most of the rest flowed into a large company. He took the clothing material and went to his lover to exchange it for a kiss and a few laughs.</p>
<p>▲ College, Engage, and Marriage</p>
<p>He was working hard towards his doctrine according to his predetermined steps, graduated from middle school, and put on a Western suit.</p>
<p>Because he firmly believed that to carry out this work, Western suits were necessary!</p>
<p>His doctrine is the three Gs: College, Engage, and Marriage</p>

<h3>Scarlet</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>At this time, the sun had reached its rest time, half of its body had hidden behind the horizon, leaving only a little bit of the tip of its tongue slightly exposed outside its lips. Flocks of crows in the sky were chattering one after another, as if proudly telling humans, "We are about to return to our happy and comfortable homes." Ouyang Sheng sent off these black dots of activity, and could not help but sigh softly, and so his thoughts progressed in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>The beginning of the second act: He barely broke through the harsh cold of the day, crossed a wilderness that seemed more vast than the Pacific Ocean, staggering and stumbling all the way, risking his life forward. He doubted several times whether there was a destination in this world that he needed at this moment. Every pore on his body was tense. Under these circumstances, he finally arrived at his destination - the home of his good friend Dongfang Sheng - but, alas, his situation at the time was actually more trembling and disheveled than a soldier who had fought hard for ten days and nights in a hail of bullets and a bloody mist. The ferocity of the wind was greater than artillery; the cruelty of the snow was greater than a quick gun; probably after a few more moments of cold and terror, he might only be able to shake hands with death, and not be able to reach the door of his beloved friend.</p>
<p>It was near midnight, and only wind and snow held all the authority. He crouched with his corpse-like cold body in front of Dongfang Sheng's steps, his whole body covered with snow, from a distance looking almost like a great white heron with its neck retracted and asleep. The joints of his entire body trembled in bursts, like a worn-out car racing madly, with no possibility of trembling any longer. His upper and lower teeth also started a fierce struggle, continuously doing that self-mutilating work. But he still stretched his neck and, in the northwest wind, desperately uttered a hoarse appeal. He thought that his cry was as loud as it could be, but the hateful northwest wind was even louder than his cry. And every time he opened his mouth, a large gust of wind, carrying several snowflakes, hit the side of his mouth. After some more time, heaven took pity, and when the merciful wind subsided slightly, he actually sent that pitiful sound inside. He actually summoned the souls of Dongfang Sheng and his wife from their sweet dreams. When he heard the voices of people inside the door, it was like receiving the gospel bestowed by God himself. As soon as the door opened, where could he wait to lift his foot and cross the threshold, his upper body plunged forward and fell straight into the door. (3)</p>
<p>Local Chronicle</p>
<h3>Ancient City Fragments</h3>
<p>— Peng Ruogu</p>
<p>Washington Irving once referred to the town of TarryTown with the name Creensburgh during his stay. I say Suzhou is a perfect fit for that description.</p>
<p>Geographically, there are three water towns: Venice in Italy, Bangkok, and our Suzhou. However, they can't match our Suzhou, which boasts the magnificent Tai Lake with 36,000 hectares and 72 peaks! The rest are hardly worth mentioning.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Above there is heaven, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou." Consider that even the alluring West Lake, famous for its beauty, is inferior to Suzhou. Isn't that proof of Suzhou's fame? Westlake said, "The Qiantang River in the evening is the most delightful time to experience the beauty of the Venice of the East." I say it's not as good as the area around Seven Mile Shantang.</p>
<p>Ever since the poet Zhang Ji's "Night Mooring" poem was introduced to Japan, Japanese scholars, merchants, and military experts have flocked to Suzhou in batches to sightsee, paint scenery, view the maple leaves at Tianping Mountain, and visit Hanshan Temple. Riding on donkeys, they secretly planned their secret work. From the perspective of our research into the arts, the poet Zhang Ji cannot escape a huge responsibility, just as we blame Marco Polo, the author of "The Travels of Marco Polo," for the current imperialist aggression.</p>
<p>The bell from "Midnight Bell Rings at the Passenger Ship" can never be heard again! It was long ago stolen by those heartless Ezo people. Kang Youwei has the lines "The bell sound has crossed the sea eastwards, chilling the maple leaves of Hanshan Ancient Temple" inscribed at Maple Bridge. Ah! Listen, listen! Isn't it wailing mournfully now on the distant three islands? It's the call of the spirits of our ancient Suzhou martyrs!</p>
<p>The modern playwright Tian Han, in his play "Suzhou Nights," sings:</p>
<p>Go, go!</p>
<p>Go to the streets at night!</p>
<p>Go to Suzhou at night!</p>
<p>How interesting the nights of Suzhou are!</p>
<p>You can see the moon on the Roman-like city walls,</p>
<p>You can see the water in the Venetian-like streets,</p>
<p>You can see gondola-like boats,</p>
<p>You can see Gypsy-like girls on the boats,</p>
<p>This is a eulogy exposing the beauty of the ancient city.</p>
<p>During the late Ming Dynasty, Mao Yilu, a henchman of the eunuch Wei Zhongxian, came to Suzhou to serve as an official. The people rose up to drive him out. Later, Wei Zhongxian wanted to kill all the people of Suzhou. The righteous men Yan Peiwei and four others boldly took responsibility for that uprising. In the end, they were killed! Such a great tragedy, in the Suzhou city with its weak popular sentiment, can be said to be the only one. But now the graves of the five righteous men have become so dilapidated that they are unrecognizable! I hope the local gentry and members of the Antiquities Preservation Association will be responsible for renovating them.</p>
<p>The modern playwright Tian Han has a play called "Blood and Snow."</p>
<p>It depicts the story of the five Suzhou martyrs who died in the late Ming Dynasty. Its value is comparable to "One Heart."</p>
<p>Women are also one of Suzhou's specialties. But in the end, they are evil! Thousands of years ago, our Suzhou was destroyed by Xi Shi. Now the Qin Terrace, Echo Corridor, and Xi Shi Cave on Lingyan Mountain are all vestiges of her sins!</p>
<p>As far as I know, Suzhou has two tomb inscriptions that are worthy of appreciation by those who love literature and art. One is at the foot of Lingyan Mountain, belonging to the poet Zhang Yongfu, with the words "Tomb of the One Who Returns." The other is the living tomb that the monk Da Xiu prepared for himself during his lifetime on Little Huang Mountain (?). The inscription on the stele reads "Da Xiu's Resting Place." Suzhou is known as a residential area, but the most regrettable shortcoming is the lack of tap water. Every household still drinks well water and river water. The well water always has a salty taste, and dead dogs and cats often fall into the river water, plus daily excrement. Drinking it is really unhygienic. This is something that the people of Suzhou must find a way to improve.</p>

<h3>The Funeral of the Humorist Chekhov</h3>
<p>— Shi Jingxie</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Chekhov was a relatively short-lived writer. On July 2, 1904, he fell ill from tuberculosis and passed away in Germany. His remains were immediately transported from Germany to Moscow. On the day the remains arrived in Moscow, the Moscow station was almost completely occupied by people welcoming the spirit. Soon, the train arrived, and a coffin was carried down from a green freight car. A troop of soldiers saluted the coffin with great respect. Although the people welcoming Chekhov's coffin felt very strange, they had no choice but to follow behind the coffin. Later, they found out they were wrong. That was the remains of General Kairell, who died in Manchuria in the Russo-Japanese War, while the coffin of the humorist Chekhov was carried down from another freight car. The body of that freight car clearly read: "Carriage for Transporting Pigs"! Isn't this deliberately joking with Chekhov?</p>
<p>Regarding the funeral that day, Gorky wrote in his diary:</p>
<p>"At most, no more than a hundred people followed Chekhov's coffin to the funeral, certainly not more. At that time, the two lawyers among the mourners made me think the most. Both of them were wearing new shoes and knotted ties, obviously both 'engaged.' I followed behind these two mourners, listening to the one called Mark Kontarkov discussing the cleverness and stupidity of dogs: the other, whom I didn't know, was boasting about how comfortable his country villa was and how beautiful the surrounding scenery was. There was also a woman wearing a wisteria-colored dress and holding a parasol decorated with green lace, chattering to an old gentleman wearing large glasses about the virtues of the deceased Chekhov: 'Do you know, he was a very charming person, and not a single word he said wasn't humorous and funny!' The old man seemed to disagree, only coughing softly. That day, the weather was very hot, and dust was flying. At the front of the funeral, a burly patrolman rode a fat white horse, leading the way triumphantly."</p>
<p>Finally, Gorky ended his recollections of the great writer's funeral with a kind of intense mockery:</p>
<p>"Everything, everything, was too extraordinarily ordinary and vulgar, which is really too much for the memory of such a great and skillful writer!"</p>
<p>This is the funeral of the humorist Chekhov. If Chekhov had a spirit, I wonder what kind of humorous and stern tone he would use in his coffin to respond to this social teasing!</p>
<h3>The Generals' Sufferings</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>Following the news of the fall of Yuguan, we saw many impassioned telegrams and speeches in the newspapers. Zhang Xueliang's speech was: He would "defend justice with blood and flesh, return our territory, everything is possible." Zhang Xueliang, who advocated non-resistance, is now determined to resist. Generals such as Yan Xishan, Han Fuju, Song Zheyuan, Xu Yuanquan, He Chengjun, and Cai Tingkai all volunteered one after another, willing to be the vanguard in resisting Japan. Even Liu Xiang, who was busy with internal warfare, telegraphed a statement "ending military affairs, ready to fight."</p>
<p>From the occurrence of the September 18th Incident until today, the situation of "friendship" and "peace" maintained in the face of enemy artillery fire and slaughter is bound to be broken. The battle of Shanhaiguan has ultimately become the fuse for the Sino-Japanese War, I think. However, more than a week has passed since the fall of Yuguan, and the front line at Shihe is calm. The newspapers are always spreading news of mediation, but things don't seem to be about to explode into war. Our policy toward Japan still seems to be calm, forbearance, and non-resistance.</p>
<p>General He Zhuguo said: "No war, no peace, no defense, no retreat, later generations will know the hardships." But in addition to General He's hardships, I know that the other generals also have their own hardships. Because "war is fierce and dangerous," especially resisting the powerful Japan is not a child's play after all. It must be fought with one's own life and territory. Look: Ma Zhanshan resisted in Longjiang, and failed. Cai Tingkai resisted in Shanghai, and withdrew his troops. Su Bingwen resisted in Manzhouli, and retreated into Russia. This time, He Zhuguo in Shanhaiguan, the result of a fierce battle, was that the magnificent pass and natural barrier turned to ashes, and he retreated to Shihe. What benefits are there to resistance? On the contrary, after the "Shanghai Truce Agreement," Shanghai still did not lose its status as a "entertainment saves the country" Shanghai. Why bother to resist?</p>
<p>Therefore, what unfolds with the Shanhaiguan Incident is definitely not a hot war of blood and fire. Please rest assured, people of the ancient country who "love peace"! Moreover, the Shanhaiguan resistance may be the last resistance. Soon, after the Shanhaiguan truce is "arranged" and "agreed," the foundation of "East Asian peace" will still be as stable as Mount Tai.</p>
<h3>Red Bean</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The modern poet Liu Dabai has a connection with red beans.</p>
<p>These small, crimson, and slightly purple beans symbolize the flames burning in his heart.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day in 1924, he received a pair of red beans from Zhou Gangzhi in Jiangyin and wrote three poems for them:</p>
<p>"At the beginning of the year," a letter, carefully sealed with two pearls, affectionately called red beans. The tree is all withered, but resurrected, fearing there are no seeds of longing, heaven leaves half a stock.</p>
<p>Looking south of the river, the tree is withered, don't look at it as an ordinary old tree, longing is conveyed by this. The body is slightly round, the color is slightly red, the starlight and rosy clouds shine in the sky, the scattered red is pitiful.</p>
<p>A pair of beans, a pair of people, red beans stored in a brocade bag, an old friend in a distant land. Like the heart, in the heart, tightly hidden in the heart, let not separation grow long.</p>
<p>He loved this charming object with deep sentimental charm, keeping it in his sleeve and playing with it endlessly. Last spring, Mr. Liu Dabai passed away, and the pair of red beans, I don't know where they have fallen. On the third day after his death, a girl in red came to touch the coffin and cry, and everyone did not know her. Asking her the reason, she revealed herself to be Mr. Liu Dabai's "sweetheart," saying that they had loved each other deeply; later, she took out the red beans as proof. This pair of red beans has finally found a home.</p>
<p>Mr. Dabai asked Zhou Gangzhi to help him find anecdotes about red beans in the Jiangyin County Records, but Zhou Gangzhi was soon executed in Jiangyin on suspicion of being a reactionary, and there was no further news. Mr. Dabai himself found the poems and lyrics of Wan Hongyou and Wang Biguo, Qu Dajun's "Wooden Language," Niu Xiu's "Yue Gu," Zhou Liangong's "Book Shadow," and other anecdotes. As far as I know, the "Sou Shen Ji" has a record:</p>
<p>"The wife of the official Han Ping was beautiful, and King Kang of Song seized her. Ping committed suicide, and his wife threw herself off the tower and died. The king was angry and ordered them to be buried so that they could not see each other. Overnight, a catalpa tree grew from both ends of the two graves, its roots intertwined below and its branches intertwined above. King Song mourned them and named the tree the 'Thinking of Each Other Tree.'"</p>
<p>This story is as sad and beautiful as the story recorded in Niu Xiu's "Yue Gu."</p>
<p>Among the poems about red beans, Wang Wei's "Red beans grow in the south, how many branches sprout in spring: I wish you would pick more, this thing is the most for longing" is the most famous. Wen Tingyun's poem, "Exquisite dice inlaid with red beans, does anyone know the bone-deep longing," is also widely circulated.</p>
<h3>New Sextant</h3>
<p>— Xia Qiu</p>
<p>A sextant is an instrument commonly used in navigation or surveying. By measuring the angle of the sun with it, the direction of the ship's course can be determined. Sextants used in the past required sunlight to measure their angles, and once fog or clouds covered the sun, the sextant basically lost its effectiveness. The new sextant is different. Even in heavy fog, it can still measure the height of the sun. Its principle is as follows: We know that the sun has infrared rays (infrared Rayss). These rays can pass through any kind of cloud or fog, but they cannot be seen by the naked eye. Only a photoelectric cell (Photo-Eltclric Cell) can collect them and make them appear on the lens. The new sextant is equipped with a specially made photoelectric tube. The infrared rays from the sun can directly shine on its telescope, so it can be used whether the sun is hidden or visible.</p>
<h3>Strange Japanese Marriage Customs</h3>
<p>— Chen Shi</p>
<p>The term "marriage" (結婚) in ancient Japan, called Mitonomakhay, or Kunag, or Yoby (transliteration), simply referred to sexual intercourse between men and women, or a man going to a woman's house for a secret rendezvous. This usage has a long history in Japanese customs, and many strange marriage customs can be inferred from these words. Now, there are not many remnants of such strange customs in Japan, so the general usage that is popular today will gradually become incomprehensible and become mysterious and archaic. This is probably due to the prohibition by the Japanese authorities or natural abolition! But it is not entirely true to say that their traditions have all disappeared. Here, let's talk about those traditions!</p>
<p>In a certain village on Awaji Island, on the eve of the wedding, the groom's most trusted friend first sleeps with the bride. This is probably a tradition of the so-called "avoidance of virginity" or "right of the first night." It has the same origin as the story of the village chief of Yomyo Village, Hetsuku County, in the northern part of Bungo Province, exercising his "right of the first night" over all the young women in the village on the night of August 16th. A similar custom is also prevalent in northeastern Hokkaido.</p>
<p>In the Ishigaki Island area of ​​the Great Ryukyu, there is also a custom of using a handkerchief stained with menstrual blood as an engagement gift. I remember Dr. Ernst Vatter's "Ritural and Peliein Morocco. Voli." also described a strange custom of Moroccan men and women getting engaged, which coincides with the Japanese custom of menstrual blood handkerchiefs. He said that Moroccan women, when they reach the age of love, firmly believe in this superstition. They believe that when they miss their lover, they only need to cut off a little of their pubic hair and armpit hair, burn it, or burn a handkerchief stained with menstrual blood, and recite a specific incantation, and it will immediately take effect, and the lover will definitely come to meet her secretly. This point can prove that there are many places in the customs of the East and the West that can be connected. The girls of Ishigaki Island in Ryukyu give their boyfriends a handkerchief stained with their own menstrual blood as a token of engagement.</p>
<p>There is also the marriage custom of Izu Oshima in Japan. When the bride is in the midst of the most lively wedding ceremony, she must sneak back to her mother's house, and she must not be known by the guests or all the people of the husband's family. If the bride cannot sneak away during the most lively wedding ceremony, she will be laughed at or scorned by the entire village. This custom of the bride sneaking away can very well prove that it is a residual concept of women who were robbed during the era of marriage by capture and still wanted to escape back.</p>
<p>There is also the marriage custom of Amami Oshima, where the groom's family first sends a messenger to the bride's house to welcome the bride. All the tricks are strung together by this messenger. He drinks heavily and sings loudly in the bride's house, and the songs are mostly teasing words. After a night of noise, the bride is welcomed back together to hold the wedding the next day.</p>
<h3>A Certain Person's Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>This world is like being pushed into a pitch-black abyss. The sun has no light and no heat since that year. The sea is howling, the wind is wailing, the world is trembling in the darkness, and everywhere you look there is gunpowder, everywhere there are living landmines.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Raising the whip, the world no longer obeys my command. Looking at the piles of goods, I can only sigh. Damn it! That group of people who can't starve to death or freeze to death still desperately make trouble: they want work, they want food.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>I heard that a group of people who can't starve to death once demonstrated in front of the solemn White House. I heard that the magnificent London was also surrounded by a group of people who can't freeze to death.</p>
<p>Our knives, guns, sticks, and gas bombs no longer have any power now.</p>
<p>Riots, uprisings, and annoying shouts have actually run into "our society"!</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>I look up to the sky and ask: What is your intention?</p>
<p>Stretching out my hand, the glory of the past cannot be recalled.</p>
<p>Everything has changed, everything has changed since that year.</p>
<p>Heaven, I can only tremble at your feet!</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Era and Love (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Madam Hezi did not recognize Haiquan as a remarkable handsome man either. However, she was interested in his strong masculinity and not entirely uninhibited attitude.</p>
<p>She lightened her footsteps and walked to his bedside.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin;"</p>
<p>She called out softly with a smile. Of course, there was no response. She really wanted to wake him up and have a long chat with her, because she hadn't seen him for several days, and she felt a little attached to him. But just for a moment, after thinking about it, she didn't have the courage. She just stood by his bed and daydreamed, and suddenly smelled a burst of alcohol. She saw Haiquan yawn in the quilt, turned over, and his face was facing outward. She thought he was awake, and her heart jumped. But Haiquan still didn't know that there was an intruder standing by his bed, and fell asleep again.</p>
<p>"That's right. He went to Ren's house to drink tonight and came back."</p>
<p>Thinking, she inadvertently looked at his desk. She saw a letter with large red characters such as "Ministry of Finance" printed on the envelope. So she lightened her footsteps and walked to the table again. She clearly saw that the ink writing on the envelope was, "Please hand over to Director Liu Xunqi," seven words, and the two black characters "Ren Tuo" were also added above the red character "Ministry."</p>
<p>She saw that a book similar to a magazine was also spread out on his desk. The title of the page that was open, "Transformation of Culture," was reflected in her retina. She turned up the cover of the magazine and saw four large red characters, "Modern Culture." On the side, the three small characters "Hua Min" were also red. In the lower left corner of the cover, there were also several deep blue cursive characters written in pen: "To Brother Haiquan for guidance, courtesy of the Modern Culture Society."</p>

<h3>Anecdotes in the Japanese Education Circle</h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>Discipline Director Works as a Prostitute</p>
<p>Professor's Wife Drives a Taxi to Pick Up Passengers</p>
<p>A few months ago, we saw in the newspapers that a female teacher in Dongying Island was working as a prostitute. Recently, the wife of a Kyoto Imperial University professor can even drive a taxi to pick up passengers. These are all anecdotes in the Japanese education circle. The reporter is not very clear about the female teacher working as a prostitute, but probably that female teacher was working as a discipline director in a certain ordinary elementary school. Because the education industry is poor and the salary she received was not enough for her to spend, the smart female teacher came up with a special way to make money: she behaved properly and went to school to work as a discipline director during the day, and at night she put on makeup and went to a coffee shop to pick up customers. Moreover, she was actually able to have a bustling business and triple her profits, and she became generous. Later, this unfortunate female teacher was arrested by the military police and fired by the school authorities. According to the Japanese themselves, it was because she committed a great crime of desecrating the sacred education industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the professor's wife who recently drove a taxi to pick up passengers, the Kyoto telegraph in Japan said this: In the Gion Kujo area of ​​Kyoto, there are noble women driving jeep taxis and frequently calling for passengers, which is quite eye-catching. After investigation, it was learned that the lady was Ritsuko, 32 years old, the wife of Kizo Ubukawa, an assistant professor in the Department of Economics at Kyoto Imperial University. Mrs. Ritsuko secretly practiced and obtained a driver's license because her husband was devoted to research and did not produce anything. She worked as a driver during the day to make a profit and as a housewife at night to manage the household, hoping to help her husband complete his studies. This Mrs. Ritsuko is really rare, rare! Professor Kizo Ubukawa can get a virtuous assistant!</p>
<p>I think Mrs. Ritsuko is very likely to have committed the crime of "hindering public morals," but perhaps the Japanese military police will forgive her because of her commendable ambition!</p>
<p>Our Chinese student circles have also had similar things happen. For example, students in a certain school in Suzhou used to pull rickshaws. Recently, Ms. Wang Yurong, a female student at Jinghua Middle School in Nanjing, worked as a singer in Confucius Temple, and unfortunately, Ms. Wang was fired by the principal for working as a singer. This can also be considered an anecdote in the education circle.</p>

<h3>Artificial Ivory</h3>
<p>— Luxhuang</p>
<p>Artificial ivory has many uses, and because it is cheap and beautiful, its sales have exceeded those of real ivory several times.</p>
<p>There are many methods for making artificial ivory, and the products are different. The most common one is made from formaldehyde and carbolic acid, named bakelite. The artificial ivory described in this article is made from a waste product, and its value is cheaper than bakelite. The manufacturing method of carbolic acid ivory will be described later.</p>
<p>After milk has been stored for a long time, there is a substance floating on the surface, like scale, which is called cheese. Ordinary people only regard it as waste from milk, but they do not know that artificial ivory, which has a wide range of applications, is made from this as raw material.</p>
<p>The industry of using cheese to make ivory was invented in 1897 and has been improved many times. Products were first launched on the market in 1900. Its products can replace products made of horns, hawksbill turtle shells, etc. When used as a substitute for celluloid, although its elasticity is not as strong as the latter, it is non-combustible and can also be used as a raw material for making children's toys. It can also insulate electricity and is often used in electrical materials. Other products include umbrella handles, fountain pen barrels, brush boards, combs, mirror frames, and many other varieties. The manufacturing method is introduced below.</p>
<p>First, use acids (such as acetic acid) to precipitate the cheese in the milk to remove other ingredients from the milk. Then add water and alkalis to the cheese and heat it to 100 degrees Celsius, stirring it while heating it until it becomes a thick colloidal liquid. At this time, the desired color can be added. Afterwards, add extremely dilute hydrochloric acid. After adding it, stir it for a long time, and then put it into various molds to press it into the shape of an object. However, this kind of product shows cracks when it dries, so after twelve hours, put the above-mentioned product into formaldehyde and take it out after a while. Not only does the nature of the finished product become hard, but also there are no cracks when it dries. It does not absorb water when immersed in water, and is much more exquisite than crude products.</p>

<h3>Returning Home to Show My Wife</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiansheng</p>
<p>A dream of boats and carts has sent off autumn. True laughter at chasing fame and fortune with a whip. I pity you for saving the family and measuring rice. The broken stove labors with firewood, cooking sorrow together. Also teach the children to rely on spinning and weaving. Again, I am shocked by the war, fleeing many times. Returning, ten thousand calamities disperse like clouds. Carrying and watching the reunion, the moon is full on the building.</p>
<h3>Frost Goose</h3>
<p>Breaking through sorrow, flying ten thousand miles in the darkness. The reflection shines on the passes and rivers, solemn all around. The spirits of those who appealed can be connected remotely. What is the point of leaving mud and melon behind? Crossing the sky, carrying a stern spirit. Arrayed, there is still a stern power. From beyond the border, a cold wind signal is tight. Ashamed in the cold, the rice and millet are abundant.</p>
<h3>The Family of a "Bumi" (Local Chinese) Mistress</h3>
<p>— Yi Lie</p>
<p>Our second landlord can be described as someone who appears in shadow plays. She is a chubby woman in her thirties. Her attitude towards tenants is also like a performance in a shadow play. She has a kind face for wealthy tenants and a ferocious face for those without money.</p>
<p>Although past her prime, she still possesses some charm. When she puts on makeup, she looks exactly like a modern young woman. Their family structure is generally like this: there is a seventy-year-old grandmother, a five or six-year-old son, a twelve or thirteen-year-old maid, and an old nanny.</p>
<p>I really can't determine who the male head of their family is. From what I know, there is a man around fifty years old and a man around thirty years old wearing a smart Western suit, who often come. And they often spend the night at the second landlord's place. But I never see the old and young ones coming at the same time, so I was obviously wrong to guess they were father and son.</p>
<p>According to the maid's address, she calls the older one "Big Master" and the younger one "Master." Of course, this cannot be taken as evidence to say that these are the second landlord's husband and young lover. I have tried all sorts of methods to find out the truth about the second landlord's family structure, but after spending a long time, I got no results at all.</p>
<p>One afternoon at two o'clock, the man in the smart Western suit came. The second landlord said:</p>
<p>"Why are you here today?"</p>
<p>"Okay, don't be so anxious."</p>
<p>Then she made a phone call. The call went through:</p>
<p>"Hello! Where is this?"</p>
<p>"Is this ×× Jewelry Shop? Ask Boss Wang to answer the phone."</p>
<p>"Is this Wang ××?"</p>
<p>"Don't come today, I have something to do and won't be back until twelve o'clock at night."</p>
<p>She hung up the receiver, returned to the room, closed the door, and I don't know what she was doing.</p>
<p>Things in the world are so coincidental.</p>
<p>One afternoon at five o'clock, the man in the smart Western suit came again, but our second landlord had already gone out.</p>
<p>About twenty minutes later, the second landlord returned in a car with a man in his fifties, bringing many things out of the car.</p>
<p>Nothing could make her more hesitant and uneasy than now. I really can't describe it. However, our second landlord is always a clever woman. She immediately turned her hesitation and uneasiness into an attitude of surprise and called out:</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Cousin, when did you come?"</p>
<p>"This is my cousin," then turning her head she said, "This is your cousin-in-law."</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, I spent all my energy and finally got a little bit of a clue.</p>
<h3>The Authoritative Child</h3>
<p>— Mi Lu</p>
<p>He's probably fourteen or fifteen years old. The child at the delivery desk of the ×× Studio speaks a Sichuan accent that's neither here nor there, and sometimes he even speaks Shanghai dialect. Although he's not very educated, he knows the first names of the girls and jumps around very actively. If there's anything to be done, he does it for people very quickly. In everyone's eyes, he's indeed a well-behaved child.</p>
<p>The waiting room is almost full of guests every day. Those who arrive later have to wait anxiously outside, hoping for a vacant seat. Especially on Saturday afternoons, the sound of laughter is no different from a teahouse. The only difference is that people are sitting around, and there are candies and melon seeds on the table, but no teapots or teacups.</p>
<p>According to the rules of the waiting room, it's open until 7 PM every night except Saturdays. Saturdays are specially extended to 9 PM. Although it's extended by two hours, the male students seem reluctant to leave, sitting there as if the rules hanging on the wall are just empty words to them.</p>
<p>The well-behaved child comes running, touching the light switch, as if he can't bear to separate him and her. But the time is up, otherwise, it seems like he's not doing his job. Finally, with a "click," he says, "Lights out!"</p>
<p>Everyone's conversation suddenly stops, and they disperse without any doubt.</p>
<p>The well-behaved child actually wields such great authority!</p>
<p>He is truly an "authoritative child."</p>

<p>(1) If a student could recite their textbook as skillfully as they sing love songs, then their achievements would be limitless! I think.</p>
<p>(2) If the Chinese spirit of doing things could be like the spirit of speaking, I think China might not be so bad!</p>

<p>(4) "Modern" is built on money.</p>

<p>(6) It's not a good sign for students to rather rack their brains and bury themselves in literary work than comfortably listen to the teacher explain calculus in the classroom!</p>
<p>(7) Today's universities don't seem like gardens for "seeking knowledge," but rather places for "seeking mates."</p>
<p>(8) Embedding a few unnecessary English words in works or conversations is considered the most beautiful thing by modern people.</p>
<h3>Gone Mad?</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhou</p>
<p>The clock struck four times, and Mother Wang knew it was time for school to end. She hurriedly put down the needlework in her hand, ran to the stove, told Ah Jin to light the coal stove, rolled up her sleeves, washed vegetables, and cut glutinous rice cakes, preparing refreshments, waiting for her sixteen-year-old son Lang to come home to eat.</p>
<p>"Mom," sure enough, her son Lang came home! But the voice of calling Mom didn't seem as cheerful and clear as it used to be, just heavy and sluggish. Lang put down his schoolbag, sat on the chair next to the table, his face like an iron plate, without saying a word.</p>
<p>"Lang! Are you hungry?" Mom asked.</p>
<p>".................................."</p>
<p>"Why don't you say anything? Are you hungry?... You..."</p>
<p>"Did you quarrel with a classmate?" Mom guessed.</p>
<p>"No, Mom."</p>
<p>"Then why aren't you happy? Are you feeling unwell?"</p>
<p>"No, Mom! I want to join the army!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I want to join the army! The Japanese are too hateful! They've occupied our Shanhaiguan! And killed countless of our loyal and brave volunteers and innocent compatriots!</p>
<p>It's hateful that those heartless compatriots of ours are actually buying Japanese goods in large quantities, otherwise how could the import of Japanese goods continue to increase sharply? Alas! The Changsha June 1st Massacre, the May 30th Incident, Jinan, ... ... ... the September 18th Incident, ... ... ... the January 28th Incident, there are too many massacres! They were born and live under the massacres! They are used to it, yes, we can't blame them! But whose fault is this? Mom! I can't be as numb as they are, at least I want to show that I am a member of the Republic of China, join the army! Fight! Drive out the Japanese dwarfs!" Lang said loudly and passionately.</p>
<p>"Be quiet! Lang, I don't know what your teacher said to you today, making you go crazy!" Mom complained about the teacher.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not crazy! I want to join the army! The teacher's words are not wrong at all! Mom, look! In the world, except for China, which country is not making progress: Turkey after the European War! India, forgetting its country! And all the small countries challenging the imperialists! The dignified Republic of China, at this critical moment of survival, doesn't save itself, resist! If you say: this is learning from India, then why isn't Japan afraid of you? Moreover, open your eyes and see, has China already forgotten its country, you need to calm down, wait until after forgetting your country before you calm down, it won't be too late! At that time, if you don't calm down, your master will tell you to calm down! But, now the country hasn't been forgotten yet! Mom, I don't want to be complacent, I... ... I want to join the army!" Lang rushed downstairs like a madman.</p>
<p>"Ah Jin! Quickly stop the young master! Don't let him run away!" Mother Wang shouted while running downstairs. "I want to join the army!" Lang cried, and Mother Wang and Ah Jin carried him to Mother Wang's bedroom.</p>
<h3>The Argument in the Self-Study Room</h3>
<p>— Wu Wei</p>
<p>This was the first day after the New Year holiday. The class bell hadn't rung yet, and there were only me and SL in the self-study room, so the air was very quiet. Ten minutes later, M came in, just stepping through the door; his mouth was already shouting, "What books are you reading! It's almost the anniversary"!</p>
<p>"What's called the anniversary?" L was the first to look up and say.</p>
<p>"Yuguan fell!... Look, Shanghai is also almost having an anniversary," M said enthusiastically. At the same time, as if to confirm this, he said: "Isn't someone moving in Zhabei again?"</p>
<p>"Okay, don't anniversary or not anniversary, I know what you mean: you think you have money, and in case something happens, you can run to the concession: live your dance hall life, right?" Our patriotic youth S said.</p>
<p>"Of course!" M said, making a face. But, then he continued, "If you don't enjoy yourself in time, do you have to wait until the country is destroyed to enjoy yourself?"</p>
<p>"You cold-blooded ××!" S said angrily.</p>
<p>"Don't say it! Looking at the current situation, if I didn't have two nostrils, I would have died of anger! At first, when the thieves came, they didn't resist, but when they had already entered the door and wanted to come to the living room, then there was so-called resistance. But, the difference in weapons is pitiful, and Yuguan finally fell. Even more ridiculous, the people behind the living room are still killing each other! The League of Nations' help to us is already very clear, but there are still people who believe in it. If this goes on, wouldn't it be better to simply destroy the country?"</p>
<p>M said a lot of nonsense.</p>
<p>"I see you talking about the destruction of the country all the time. When the country is really destroyed, will you still have such happiness and freedom as you have now?... The Northeast Volunteer Army is resisting because they don't want to be slaves to a destroyed country, and also because they can't stand the tragic sight of a destroyed country. According to your way of spending money, although I don't want you to destroy your family to help the country, you should donate a little more money to the Volunteer Army. Last time when you donated to the Volunteer Army, it was painful to see you take out four dimes?... "S thought of M's stingy appearance when donating money last time and became more and more angry.</p>
<p>"Then since you are so patriotic, why don't you go to the Northeast to fight?" S said.</p>
<p>"Although I don't go to the Northeast, I won't go to the dance hall during the national crisis," M said, at the same time, he shielded M with his hand, which was obviously a sign of challenge.</p>
<p>"A poor ghost like you isn't qualified to enter a dance hall!" M said, twisting his mouth.</p>
<p>S was extremely angry at this time and was ready to act freely, M was also clenching his fists ready to resist! At this time, L, who was sitting next to him, quickly dragged S away: saying that if you want to fight, go fight the dwarfs! Don't also play the game of fighting among ourselves, coincidentally the bell rang, so they each took their books to take the big exam, I followed behind them, walking and thinking, it was really funny and infuriating, I didn't expect people who received university education to say such nonsense, and the so-called patriots would also do this trick of fighting among themselves, and fighting their own people, alas! Patriotic youths, Chinese students.</p>
<p>Correspondence from Store Employees</p>
<h3>The Method of "Looking for a Horse While Riding One"</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Wu's letter "Recognizing a Thief as a Father and Being in a Dilemma" on January 8th, I deeply sympathize with him. However, I don't think your answer is very satisfactory. Because your answer is "Resignation is the right thing to do, and as for the future problems, as long as you are willing to endure hardship, it is not difficult to solve your personal life." But Mr. Wu's letter has already mentioned "There are no relatives or friends in Shanghai." If he resigns, he will have no relatives or friends to turn to, and his finances will inevitably be difficult! Food and lodging will become a problem. Even if he lives in a small inn and eats pancakes and fried dough sticks, it will cost at least forty cents a day. If he finds a job within one or two days, that's fine, but if he can't find one, how will he support himself after a long time?</p>
<p>So my humble opinion is: while you haven't resigned yet, it's better to temporarily endure the humiliation in order to wait for a good opportunity to come. On the one hand, encourage yourself in the store, and on the other hand, pay attention to advertisements in the newspaper for trainee positions, etc., and work hard to take the exam. After passing the exam, then resign from your original position. This is the so-called "looking for a horse while riding one" method, so that you don't fall into extreme difficulty. What do you gentlemen think?</p>
<p>Respectfully, Wu Dingxin, January 9th</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After reading the above letter, we are very impressed with Mr. Wu's deep thinking and careful planning. We also welcome his suggestion of different opinions and further planning of practical methods.</p>
<p>However, we believe that this "looking for a horse while riding one" method is good, of course! But from the standpoint of the nation, it can be used to find a way out because you are dissatisfied with the bad environment in the stubborn store, but it cannot be used in Japanese stores, which have always been regarded as enemies.</p>
<p>We still remember: during the fierce "January 28th" Songhu bloody battle last year, a driver named Hu Amao drove a car full of enemy military supplies and with four enemy soldiers escorting the car into the Huangpu River! He exchanged the lives of four enemies for the life of one person, and added tens of thousands of dollars worth of military supplies. This spirit of sacrificing oneself is a true manifestation of the Chinese national character! This spirit! It has won unanimous praise from the whole country and even the world! After a year, our impression is still very deep.</p>
<p>Now, the Volunteer Army outside the Pass is fighting bloody battles with the enemy in the snowy and icy land. Although they have difficulty with supplies and lack clothing and food, they are not tempted by the enemy's huge amount of money: although they lack follow-up support and have weak troops, they are not threatened by the enemy's heavy artillery fire: their perseverance and unyielding behavior, and their commendable actions, the manifestation of national character, and the spirit of fearless sacrifice; have also won the sympathy of the people of the whole country and the praise of people all over the world!</p>
<p>In this way, what does personal sacrifice count for? We must stand on our position, carry forward our inherent national character, and absolutely not cooperate with our enemies: this is our humble intention in answering Mr. Wu.</p>
<p>Based on the above point of view, we also feel that although Mr. Wu has temporarily gained material comfort in the enemy's store, he is suffering tremendously in spirit. (See Mr. Wu's own statement) So we resolutely told him "Resignation is the right thing to do"; as for Mr. Wu after resignation, then we should find another way, we would rather starve to death, and never should we serve the enemy. We have no power to help solve the problem of food and lodging, but we believe that if Mr. Wu has the determination to "rather starve to death than live in dishonor," he will definitely get help from the society. If society cannot help, it is the people of the country who have failed Mr. Wu, and Mr. Wu has not failed the nation! If Mr. Wu does not have this determination, we dare not advise him to resign.</p>

<h3>Sympathizers, Continued XV</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>This landlord was originally a gentleman, but because the power of the township autonomous region has been transferred to the new-school young gentry, he has no connection at all. Because of a small matter, he was caught by the district and severely fined. Moreover, he also sent a heavy gift to the gentlemen in the district. Only then did he realize that the new school people were more powerful in raising money than the old school people, and he simply didn't dare to provoke the people in the autonomous region. Now that Meng Guobao mentioned the district again, he was a little scared, so he didn't dare to say strong words anymore. He pulled one of the people who ate with him over and asked him to intercede, saying good things and bad things, and stipulating that Wang Laoer would pay two more dan of rice. If there was no rice, he would pay ten yuan. This was a happy surprise for Wang Laoer, and he agreed to everything, because he expected to pay at least twenty yuan. After this negotiation was over, everyone dispersed, and Meng Guobao also bid farewell. Wang Laoer helped the second sister-in-law wash the bowls and pots in the kitchen. Seeing that there were still a dozen or twenty melon seeds on the windowsill, he asked: Who left these melon seeds? Laoer said it unintentionally, but the second sister-in-law's face turned red. She said: Who do you think left them? There won't be a second person in the kitchen. You really don't know how to talk. Wang Laoer laughed: It's not worth getting angry over this, right? He said, accompanying her to wash the dishes and clean the floor. But he thought that he had offended the cook with just a word, and if he ignored her, she would get angry again, so he found something to say and said to the second sister-in-law: Hey! Do you think Mr. Meng San is good? He just said this casually, but when the second sister-in-law Wang heard it, her heart skipped a beat, her face turned red, but she couldn't work. Wang Laoer didn't know that there was another reason for this, and still looked down and said: Mr. Meng San is really good. In previous years, when the landlord came to settle accounts, many middlemen would talk at once, and they could never say anything. This year, Mr. Meng San touched his face, and in a few words, he talked away most of the rent rice. He said that he sympathized with people like us who grow fields, and I didn't believe it before, but now it seems that people are telling the truth. After he explained it again, the second sister-in-law Wang understood what he meant and said very casually; He was just happy for a while. Wang Laoer said: Don't talk nonsense, he really has a good heart and wants to be friends with me. Haven't you seen that he always talks with me until midnight these past two nights? But the second sister-in-law Wang didn't answer.</p>

<h3>Consumer Cooperative in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>American capitalism is developed and the economy is affluent, but looking back at society, the unemployed are still calling for relief in groups. The number of people is not uncommon compared to other countries. In Hollywood's film industry, this recession is inevitable. Therefore, many stars initiated, based on the spirit of cooperation, and raised funds to establish a consumer cooperative and open stores to benefit their peers in purchasing.</p>
<p>Most of the various things sold in the store are made by out-of-school girls from poor families. Other things like furniture, antiques, and evening dresses and shoes and socks owned by stars are donated voluntarily. Small actors and others who do odd jobs have very difficult lives. Buying things in this store is very cheap, which can reduce a little burden economically.</p>
<p>The staff in the store are all filled by the wives or daughters of the stars. Their background, of course, is not for the sake of the bread problem. They are completely fulfilling their obligations to society, so that the poor can get universal grace. The stars themselves, standing and watching them do business, often use various games such as throwing pots in the tea room to pass the time, arousing a lot of interest from customers.</p>
<p>The money earned by the cooperative is entirely used for charity. There are many actresses who have children at home but cannot afford to hire maids. When she is filming, she cannot take care of her children at the same time, which is quite difficult. Therefore, the cooperative has specially hired many female nurses to take care of their children. There are many toys available here. Walt Disney even drew funny cartoons for them to play.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other places where they have the opportunity to implement relief. If you open their record book, you can see a glimpse of the contents.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>"Remaining Life" Six Hours to Live, Screening in Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>This is an "ordinary" film that gives us a "deep impression"!</p>
<p>The representative of a small country argues alone with the great powers in the League of Nations in Geneva, saving his country from the brink of ruin. The hostile country wants to pass a motion when the meeting is closed. Therefore, in his residence, he is strangled with a rope. Fortunately, a great scientist has newly invented a machine that can bring the dead back to life, but the effect only lasts for six hours? This diplomat is resurrected under the authority of science. He knows the shortness of his life, and that his lover does not know this tragic change, so he decides to persuade her to love his rival. In the end, he also vetoed the League of Nations' motion. The plot, we can say that it is too distorted, but at the same time, it cannot be said that it is not full of ideals. The first third of the whole film is inevitably stagnant, but the last two-thirds are full of stimulation and vitality. Warner Baxter plays the hero of this small country representative in the remaining six hours of his life. He has a deep, calm, and determined performance. After persuading his lover in the garden to love his rival, he sadly took out the rose that she had just given him! Warner died and she still thought he would accompany him to a banquet and personally send it to the Chinese servant! And the kissing of flowers at the time of death, meeting a female thief on the road and giving her all the money, and meeting a poor young girl and asking about her dead sister, how touching it is. John Bowers, although only a few scenes, made a good contribution. The heroine is the newly discovered British girl Marlene Gordon, who also does not lose her status.</p>
<p>"Air Mail Bandit Blood" is produced by Universal Pictures of the United States, with air mail as the theme and the service spirit of airmen as the description of the evolution of the story, which is quite tense. It is being screened at 　　　 starting today.</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Screening of Soviet Films in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>The famous Soviet films "Road to Life" and "Two Meetings" will soon be screened in Shanghai. This news was obtained from Mr. Sayediez, the manager of the Soviet Film Company in Shanghai. Mr. Sa has just returned to Shanghai from Nanjing. He said that the above two films have been approved by the Central Film Inspection Committee and allowed to be screened. "Two Meetings" will be screened first. The film is directed by Urinov and the subject matter and photography and sound are excellent. "Road to Life" has been screened in 27 countries and has been shown in Paris for six months. It is very popular. It was produced by the young director Nikolai Eke, describing the life of vagrants in old Russia. Both films are realistic works, based on the real life of Russia, and were praised when reviewed in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Legal Observations on "Conscience"</h3>
<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>Columbia Company's productions have always been the patent of Guanglu. However, recently, its productions have also appeared in cinemas under the United Company. It is a relatively new company, so it has very special features in terms of new ideas and trends. Of course, it has no historical constraints and nothing old to guard.</p>
<p>The recently released "Conscience" Attorney for the Defense at the Cathay Theater, if judged from an artistic point of view, Edmund Lowe plays a retired lawyer, his eloquence and attitude are really amazing. Because of the continuity of the play's purpose, he often has places with a cold and humorous meaning. Very few supporting actors appear, so there is nothing to talk about. The merits and demerits of the director are equal and not worth praise or criticism, but I think this film is excellent, it has other outstanding strengths!</p>
<p>What I am talking about is the skill and purpose of this film. It can point out the importance of the position occupied by law in the mid-20th century, and attack the weaknesses of modern law. In Chinese films, law is never mentioned at all. Even in foreign films, the descriptions of law, courts, and courts are mostly based on the parties involved in the litigation as the main body, so there is bound to be some bias in observation. A film is too much of an exception. It enters the skin of the law and makes an in-depth study of the inside story, exposing the current judicial inside story of the country without adding any false colors. It clearly states that a lawyer can play with jurors and judges rely on eloquent arguments to turn the case around in their hands. The law in modern times has extreme shortcomings and can never call out injustice for the weak.</p>
<p>Of course, it describes the weakness of "Anglo-American law," based on precedents. But I believe that the "statutory law" adopted by China also has considerable errors. This film also proves that the perfection of the law must be sought from the lawyers themselves. If lawyers do not reform, the law will not improve.</p>
<p>If you like to watch legal films, then this is the only good film. However, there are too many legal professional terms and "precedents" in it, which inevitably reduces interest. But I hope that the judges, jurists, and lawyers in Shanghai, especially those who study "Anglo-American law," will go and see it, because it is a useful practical reference book.</p>
<h3>Audience Comments: A Discussion on "The Tramp"</h3>
<p>— Sheng Hong</p>
<p>Recently, amidst the warming atmosphere of the northern war clouds, the Grand Theater and the Lyceum Theatre simultaneously premiered RKO Pictures' excellent film, "The Tramp," the latest masterpiece by the comedic genius Will Rogers. The film's entire concept is novel, the leading actor's performance is humorous and satirical, and the female lead, Madge Evans, is a rising star who demonstrates significant progress in her acting. Her exquisite and lively demeanor greatly contributes to the development of the plot. Will Rogers plays the role of a tramp in this film, a wanderer returning from the battlefield, "boundless as the vast, sandy plain..."</p>
<p>The general plot describes a young man who leaves his wife to join the army. His delicate wife, unaccustomed to cold nights, ventures out to seek a new love. Not long after the outbreak of the war, his wife leaves behind a daughter and her soul ascends to heaven. The daughter is raised by her stepfather and grows into a charming young woman. She and her stepfather's son are childhood sweethearts, innocent and pure. Now that they have both reached adulthood, their love for each other deepens. The stepfather secretly facilitates their union to comfort his beloved wife in the afterlife. Meanwhile, the young man who joined the army returns from the front lines, homeless and wandering the streets, sleeping under the sky and living the life of a "tramp" every day. However, he never ceases to inquire about his beloved daughter. Soon, his wish is fulfilled, but the young man discovers that his daughter lives a prosperous life and has become a wealthy socialite. He is immersed in nature and his heart is filled with unparalleled joy.</p>
<p>Several days later, he leaves this place and heads to the ends of the earth, resuming his life as a "tramp"!</p>
<h3>The Most Modern Woman Among Three Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Xia Shuxun</p>
<p>A truly modern woman is rational, courageous, and capable of self-reliance. Take Zhou Shuzhen, for example. She is a woman from the petty bourgeoisie, full of reason, bravery, and the ability to support herself. When she is fired from her company, she is not afraid and even says with a smile: "We have our own hands, what are we afraid of? What did God give us hands for? Besides, I am sacrificing myself for the masses!" Indeed, in this bizarre society, as long as a person has hands and is willing to work hard, they won't have trouble finding food everywhere. Although she suffers some material hardship, her spirit remains truly joyful, filled with mutual comfort and understanding.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can boldly say, from a definitive standpoint, that "the most modern person in this film is Zhou Shuzhen, a petty bourgeois woman full of revolutionary spirit." (Unpaid)</p>
<h3>Roland Young's Duck Garden on the Summit of Beverly Hills</h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>Hollywood star Roland Young has a quirk: he loves ducks most of all. When his friends give him gifts, no matter how precious and valuable they are, he is not particularly surprised. But if you give him a pair of ducks, then he is truly indescribably happy. Therefore, every Christmas, most of the gifts he receives are ducks.</p>
<p>When he first arrived in Hollywood, he co-starred with John Barrymore in "Sherlock Holmes," which was more than fifteen years ago. In these fifteen years, he has bought and received countless ducks from friends. He raises them all carefully in a residence he built on Beverly Hills, which is essentially a duck garden. It has a small reputation in Hollywood, and many people visit it.</p>
<p>Roland Young's quirk has been like this since he was a child. When he was young, his parents took him to the zoo, and he refused to leave when he saw the ducks. Later, his parents bought two ducks to take home, and he finally calmed down. In addition to loving ducks, he also cherishes other animals. Whenever he sees a cat on the road or anywhere else without food, he catches it and carefully feeds it. However, his greatest love is for ducks, which led him to create his unique duck garden.</p>
<h3>Clara Bow Recent News</h3>
<p>— Cun</p>
<p>"Call Her Savage" has been completed. Although it is said to be Clara Bow's most successful film since she started making movies, it is still a question whether she will continue to work hard because of its success. Perhaps she will first travel to Europe and take a long rest, and then consider making other films. Her contract with Fox was exaggeratedly described as: "She won't do it unless it's a masterpiece."</p>
<h3>Ann Harding Gradually Developing the Intention to Retire</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Ann Harding's popularity has declined recently. She has stated that after completing the two new films she has already contracted for, she will quit the screen, because she says that being in the film industry has deprived her of all her happiness. Many people in Hollywood also feel that she has often expressed pessimism recently, but some suspect that if her two new films have unexpected success, then her current attitude will disappear. It is unknown whether the guess is correct; only Ann Harding knows for sure.</p>
<h3>"The Match King" Story (6)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ximeng</p>
<p>"Paul, Paul," Sonia had apparently succumbed to Paul's hypnotic control. "How much longer must we wait, darling?" "Not much longer, but we must be patient. Does Rodinsky like you?"</p>
<p>"Alas, he doesn't love me very much either. He is very busy with his affairs and has been frowning these days."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"The Ministry of Finance has discovered a deficit of five and a half million. Rodinsky has been running around day and night these days trying to make it up."</p>
<p>Paul jumped up and ran out, grabbing his hat.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" The woman asked in indescribable horror.</p>
<p>"You can imagine, my dear, that anything that could make me part from you for even a moment must be extremely important."</p>
<p>"Are you coming back?"</p>
<p>"I'll be back in a little while."</p>
<p>"I don't know whether to believe you or not. I suppose you've heard some news from me again and are going to leave me again."</p>
<p>Paul calmly took a ring out of his pocket.</p>
<p>"Darling, this is my mother's wedding ring. In my eyes, it is the most precious thing in the world." He slipped the ring onto Sonia's finger and bowed his head to kiss it gently. "This is my proof."</p>
<p>Sonia looked at the very simple gold ring, her eyes filled with tears of joy.</p>
<p>When Paul Krull went to see Rodinsky, Rodinsky was terrified to be discovered by Paul that his secret had been exposed. He was at a loss for what to do, but he tried to appear calm and said repeatedly, "Krull, are you crazy? You must have heard wrong." But his lips were already turning gray, and trembling frequently, showing his failure, helplessness, surprise, and misery.</p>
<p>Paul, on the other hand, was confident and responded with a slight smile. He knew that victory belonged to him. He stood up. "If you can get your friends in the cabinet to accept my construction, that is, the money they need, fifty million worth of Treasury bonds, are under the pillow on Sonia's bed. This is a small gift from me to you."</p>
<p>Rodinsky said weakly, "You must know that this is extortion."</p>
<p>"Of course," Paul smiled.</p>
<p>"How do you know Sonia?" Rodinsky asked after a long pause, as if gasping for air.</p>
<p>"This is my ability. I know a little about everything. Every great figure in Europe, whether man or woman, I recognize slightly."</p>
<p>Rodinsky pretended to be calm and struck a match to smoke, but his hand was trembling. He said, "Very well, Krull, I can now decide that the Cabinet will definitely grant you the monopoly on matches in Poland." (To be continued)</p>
